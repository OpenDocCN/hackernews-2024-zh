- en: One of Karl Marx’s most penetrating insights was that a network of mechanisms
    embedded in the logic of capitalism not only fuel the system’s transformative
    dynamism but also undermine its cohesion. These internal contradictions operate
    across every dimension of the socioeconomic landscape, including its ideological
    characteristics and political institutions. In their relentless pursuit of profits,
    capitalist enterprises constantly strive to reduce their labor costs through wage
    suppression and mechanization. But reductions in the buying power of workers erode
    the primary source of demand for the products those enterprises must sell in order
    to realize profits.

  zh: 卡尔·马克思最深刻的见解之一是，资本主义逻辑中嵌入的一系列机制不仅推动着系统的变革动力，而且破坏着系统的凝聚力。这些内在矛盾贯穿于社会经济景观的每个维度，包括其意识形态特征和政治制度。在不断追求利润的过程中，资本主义企业不断努力通过压低工资和机械化来降低劳动成本。但是工人购买力的下降侵蚀了这些企业必须销售以实现利润的产品的主要需求来源。
- en: Capitalism gave rise to a value system that teaches us to find meaning in our
    work; yet millions are employed in low-paying, soul-crushing jobs. And while modern
    capitalism promises — and is indeed fully capable of providing — broad-based prosperity,
    the system, via the state, routinely promotes and enforces austerity policies
    aimed at compelling people to work harder for lower pay and less job security.
    Output per worker increases year by year because of improvements in technology,
    but the austerity evangelists insist that if we want capitalism to continue to
    bestow its blessings on humanity, workers must accept lower living standards and
    the social safety net needs to be dismantled.

    scale. During the Great War, national governments took control of their economies
    to ensure that the material requirements of the war would be met. Wages, work
    hours, and prices were regulated; production targets were imposed on manufacturers;
    strikes were criminalized, and shirking was penalized by conscription and deployment
    to the front; private property was requisitioned; key industries were nationalized.

    without triggering a disruptive backlash from either the working class or the

    forces never operate independently of society’s political dynamics. If the state
    could mold the economy to serve the needs of war, in peacetime it could mold it
    to promote the well-being of those whose sweat, muscles, and brains are the basis
    of national prosperity. The war had demonstrated “the profoundly political nature
    of the capitalist economy.” When the war ended, workers, who had toiled and bled
    for their country, wanted a fairer share of the income their labor was generating;
    they wanted the right to unionize; and they wanted better working conditions,
    decent housing, and an effective social safety net.

  zh: 但是这些大规模的战时干预暴露出一个不便的事实。经济力量永远不会独立于社会政治动态之外。如果国家可以塑造经济为战争服务，那么在和平时期，它也可以塑造经济来促进那些以汗水、肌肉和大脑为国家繁荣基础的人们的福祉。战争已经证明了“资本主义经济的深刻政治性质”。战争结束后，曾经为国家辛勤劳作和流血的工人们希望得到他们劳动所产生的收入的更公平分配；他们希望有组织工会的权利；他们希望有更好的工作条件、体面的住房和有效的社会安全保障。
- en: In Britain and Italy, workers were organized, had suffrage rights, and, by 1919,
    were making demands on employers and the state for a revision of the social contract.
    This threat to the prerogatives of capital, Mattei argues, provoked a reaction
    in the form of a comprehensive set of state-imposed austerity policies aimed at
    pounding the working class into a state of docility. In addition to repelling
    the existential menace of working-class militancy, these policies would establish
    lasting mechanisms for channeling income and wealth upward from workers to capitalists.

    book. She has done an impressive amount of archival research and has skillfully

- en: 'She calls our attention to a pair of international conferences that were convened
    shortly after the end of the Great War to discuss the financial and economic challenges
    that confronted the combatant European nations. The League of Nations sponsored
    a conference in Brussels in 1920; another conference took place in Genoa in 1922
    under the auspices of the Supreme Council of the Allies. Historians have generally
    regarded these conferences as failures because the participating delegates were
    unable to arrive at a concrete agreement for managing the problems posed by war
    debt and globally disordered balance of payments accounts. Mattei argues instead
    that the two conferences established the framework of the austerity agenda adopted
    throughout the capitalist world in subsequent decades: “The two conferences reunited
    the European establishment under the flag of technocracy to construct and implement
    austerity. Technocrats were rising as the new protectors of capitalism — and their
    sermon was heard loud and clear across the continent.”'

- en: 'The austerity gospel held that economic growth was driven not by the productive
    activity and spending of workers but by the virtuous abstinence of capitalists,
    whose savings were transformed into capital accumulation by the invisible hand
    of the market. National prosperity therefore required the redistribution of income
    away from workers and toward capitalists. Workers’ demands for higher wages and
    fewer hours had to be resisted. Public spending on health care, education, and
    social services had to be sharply curtailed because it drew financial resources
    away from capital accumulation. Government budgets needed to be balanced, and
    monetary policy needed to be tightened. The rhetoric adopted to support this agenda
    was at times alarmist; one of the documents issued by the Brussels conference
    contains this dire warning: “Any country which does not contrive as soon as possible
    to attain the execution of these principles is doomed beyond hope of recovery.”'

  zh: 紧缩福音传承，经济增长不是由工人的生产活动和支出推动的，而是由资本家的美德节制推动的，他们的储蓄通过市场的看不见的手变成了资本积累。因此，国家繁荣需要将收入从工人转移到资本家。必须抵制工人对更高工资和更少工时的要求。对医疗保健，教育和社会服务的公共支出必须大幅削减，因为这些支出将财务资源从资本积累中抽走。政府预算需要平衡，并且货币政策需要收紧。为了支持这一议程，采取了有时是危言耸听的言辞；布鲁塞尔会议发布的文件之一包含了这样的严峻警告：“任何一个不尽快实施这些原则的国家都注定无法复苏。”
- en: 'Mattei identifies three kinds of austerity policies: fiscal austerity, monetary
    austerity, and industrial austerity — the “austerity trinity.” Fiscal austerity
    involves reducing government spending, particularly on programs aimed at providing
    social services and income support to working-class people; regressive taxation,
    aimed at buttressing the after-tax incomes of the propertied classes, is also
    part of the fiscal austerity mix. Monetary austerity entails restricting access
    to liquidity and credit when labor markets get tight and wages start to rise.
    Instead of letting the market adjust the price of labor in response to worker-friendly
    market conditions, the austerity credo requires that workers get knocked back
    into line by a state-generated recession.'

  zh: 马泰确定了三种类型的紧缩政策：财政紧缩，货币紧缩和工业紧缩——“紧缩三位一体”。财政紧缩包括削减政府支出，特别是针对为工薪阶层提供社会服务和收入支持的项目；对于税收的回归，旨在支持有财产阶级的税后收入，也是财政紧缩的一部分。货币紧缩涉及在劳动力市场紧张和工资开始上涨时限制获取流动性和信贷。紧缩信条要求，而不是让市场根据对工人友好的市场条件调整劳动力价格，必须通过由国家引发的经济衰退将工人打回到正轨。
- en: 'Fiscal discipline and monetary restraint are what normally come to mind when
    we think of austerity. But Mattei reminds us that industrial austerity is an important
    part of the arsenal of the capitalist state. Industrial austerity is the weakening
    or abolition of laws and institutions that protect the interests of workers: right-to-work
    laws, lax enforcement of fair hiring rules, legislative impediments to the formation
    of labor unions, tolerance of noncompete clauses in labor contracts, and so forth.
    Cuts to unemployment benefits weaken the bargaining position of unemployed people
    relative to employers by reducing the amount of time an unemployed person can
    take to find a good job; such cuts would fall under the headings of both fiscal
    and industrial austerity. In the jargon of modern economics, industrial austerity
    is often characterized as enhancing “labor market flexibility.” A major aim of
    all austerity regimes is to break the back of organized labor, to neuter it and
    render it incapable of protecting workers.'

  zh: 财政纪律和货币约束通常是我们想到紧缩时的关键词。但马泰提醒我们，工业紧缩是资本主义国家的重要武器之一。工业紧缩是削弱或废除保护工人利益的法律和制度的过程：例如《工作权利法》，对公平招聘规则的宽松执行，对劳工组织形成的立法障碍，对劳动合同中不竞争条款的容忍等等。削减失业救济金削弱了失业者相对于雇主的谈判地位，因为减少了失业者寻找好工作的时间；这样的削减既属于财政紧缩又属于工业紧缩。在现代经济学的术语中，工业紧缩常被描述为增强“劳动力市场的灵活性”。所有紧缩政策的主要目标之一是击败有组织劳工，使其失去作用并且无法保护工人。
- en: A substantial portion of the book is devoted to detailed examinations of how
    austerity was implemented in Britain and Italy. Mattei shows that in both countries
    the enforcement of austerity was achieved by removing economic policymaking from
    democratic control. But the precise method by which democracy was sabotaged differed.
    In Britain, responsibility for economic decision-making was transferred to the
    Treasury and the Bank of England, institutions that were insulated from electoral
    accountability. The two institutions coordinated their activity closely to advance
    the austerity agenda.

- en: In Italy, the Fascist government that came to power in 1922 imposed austerity
    largely by decree, and eliminated resistance through electoral fraud, disenfranchisement
    of the electorate, the imprisonment of political opponents, the suppression of
    press freedoms, and physical brutality — including political assassinations. Mattei’s
    point is that, notwithstanding their radical differences in approach, both countries
    relied upon antidemocratic strategies to execute their austerity agendas in the
    interwar period. She paints a vivid picture of the policies that were implemented
    and of the human wreckage they caused.

    to strike; he contended that “wages were much higher than [workers’] marginal
    productivity”; and he endorsed the violent suppression of dissent, including the
    execution of communist leaders. The casualness with which British monetary economist
    Ralph G. Hawtrey and Treasury officials Basil Blackett and Otto Niemeyer — the
