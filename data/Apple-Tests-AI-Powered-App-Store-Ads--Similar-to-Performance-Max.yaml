  zh: 苹果已经开始与一小部分广告主测试一款产品，该产品会自动决定在其应用商店内放置广告的位置，类似于Google的Performance Max和Meta的Advantage+。
- en: Apple's current ad formats consist of two types of ads within the search tab
    and on the search-results page, "you might also like" ads that appear on app product
    pages, and those that appear on the "today" tab when users open the App Store.
    In this new campaign type, advertisers enter their budget and cost-per-acquisition
    target, as well as the audiences and countries they want to reach. Apple's algorithm
    then automatically decides where best to place the brand's ads across the four
    available formats.

  zh: 苹果目前的广告格式包括两种类型的广告：在搜索选项卡和搜索结果页面内的广告，“您可能也喜欢”的广告出现在应用产品页面上，并且在用户打开应用商店的“今天”选项卡时显示。在这种新的广告类型中，广告主输入他们的预算和每次获客成本目标，以及他们希望触达的受众和国家。苹果的算法随后会自动决定在四种可用格式中最佳放置品牌广告的位置。
- en: Apple has told advertisers it's conducting the tests in an effort to learn how
    it can improve the performance of its Apple Search Ads, but one of the people
    familiar with the matter said they expected the company to officially introduce
    the product in the coming months. This person was granted anonymity because they
    were not authorized to speak publicly about the program.

    Seufert说道。
- en: Seufert added that while he was skeptical Apple would place mobile app-install
    ads in its News and Stock apps — because they're managed using a different ads
    interface — a Performance Max-type tool could be a precursor to Apple launching
    new ad placements in its other assets. Commentators have previously speculated
    that [Apple would soon bring ads to Maps, Apple TV+, and its Books app](https://www.businessinsider.com/6-predictions-for-apple-advertising-platform-next-year-2022-12).
    [Apple also recently launched a Sports app](https://www.businessinsider.com/apple-sports-app-is-here-2024-2),

  zh: Seufert补充说，虽然他对苹果会在其新闻和股票应用中放置移动应用安装广告持怀疑态度，因为它们使用不同的广告界面进行管理，但类似Performance
    Max的工具可能是苹果在其其他资产中推出新广告位置的先兆。评论员们此前曾推测，[苹果可能很快将广告引入到地图、Apple TV+和其图书应用](https://www.businessinsider.com/6-predictions-for-apple-advertising-platform-next-year-2022-12)中。
