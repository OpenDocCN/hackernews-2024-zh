- en: The settlement, which only applies to US merchants, is the result of a lawsuit
    filed in 2005\. However, nothing is considered finalized until it receives approval
    from the US District Court for the Eastern District of New York. Even then, the
    case can also be appealed in what could be a lengthy battle.

    makes — [but can be as much as 4% for some premium rewards cards](https://nrf.com/advocacy/policy-issues/swipe-fees#:~:text=For%20credit%20cards%2C%20the%20fees,from%20small%20banks%20are%20exempt.),

  zh: 尽管商家长期以来一直主张刷卡费用迫使他们提高价格，但和解并不一定会为消费者省钱。
- en: That’s because the settlement gives merchants the ability to impose surcharges
    on customers, depending on what kind of Visa or Mastercard card they use. Those
    surcharges would likely hit cardholders who get rewards such as cash back and
    airline miles, since those can carry higher swipe fees.

  zh: 这是因为和解允许商家根据顾客使用的Visa或Mastercard卡片的类型对顾客收取附加费。这些附加费可能会影响到享受现金返还和航空里程等奖励的持卡人，因为这些卡片可能具有更高的刷卡费用。
- en: On the other hand, some cardholders could get discounts on goods and services,
    since merchants would be able to make deals with banks to get them to use what
    they consider to be a preferred card.

    settlement “will represent a threat to credit card rewards and small banks.” That’s
    because he believes merchants will “steer customers to preferred credit cards.”

  zh: 然而，TD Cowen分析师Jaret Seiberg在一份周二的备忘录中表示，这项和解“将对信用卡奖励和小银行构成威胁”。因为他认为商家将“引导顾客使用优选信用卡”。

    put them at a major disadvantage to larger banks that have an easier time making
    deals with some of the nation’s largest retailers, like Walmart, Seiberg added.
