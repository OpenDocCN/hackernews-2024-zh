- en: I spent six years at Cambridge Consultants, building some interesting systems,
    managing our Sun workstations and learning a lot, but by then Sun had opened a
    sales office across the street, and I wanted to find out what they were going
    to release next, before everyone else. So in 1988 I joined the Sun sales force
    and became a Systems Engineer (nowadays we would say Solutions Architect). This
    was a big jump to make, I had to wear a suit to work every day, and spend all
    my time paired up with a sales rep visiting customers. I really enjoyed the variety
    of working with several different customers every day, on different problems,
    and being part of an extremely innovative and fast growing company. I also learned
    a lot about how to work directly with customers, when to shut up and let the sales
    guy drive the conversation, and generally how technology sales works. The early
    days at Sun Cambridge were special, I absorbed a lot about networking and the
    technical side of the role from my fellow systems engineer Martin Baines, and
    we were driving all over the region in cool company cars (I had a Citroen BX 16V)
    selling a really hot product. The company and the team got bigger over time, but
    with the initial sales team of Paul Martin (Ford Sierra Cosworth — the fastest
    sales guy in East Anglia), Martin Harris (Land Rover Discovery — recruited an
    inflatable skeleton as an extra sales guy), David Morley (Vauxhall Carlton — always
    betting on the horses at Newmarket), and Gary Littlefair (BMW 320 — did over 200%
    of his target several years running as we took British Telecom to Sun UK’s biggest
    account) we were “kicking butt and having fun” as Scott McNealy liked to say.
    I also got to visit Sun head office in California regularly for training sessions,
    and met some interesting people there, in particular Reynold Jabbour from New
    York, who is deeply insightful on both people and technology, ran the Systems
    Engineers team for the east coast, later went to work for various Wall Street
    banks, and is still one of my closest friends.

  zh: 我在剑桥顾问公司工作了六年，构建了一些有趣的系统，管理我们的太阳工作站，学到了很多东西，但那时太阳公司在街对面开了一家销售办事处，我想要比其他人先找出他们接下来要发布什么产品。所以我于1988年加入了太阳公司的销售团队，并成为了系统工程师（现在我们会说解决方案架构师）。这是一个很大的飞跃，我每天都得穿西装上班，并且整天都得和销售代表一起拜访客户。我真的很享受每天与不同客户合作，解决不同的问题，并成为一个极具创新和快速成长的公司的一部分。我还学到了如何直接与客户合作，何时闭嘴，让销售人员主导谈话，以及技术销售工作的一般知识。太阳剑桥的早期日子是特别的，我从我的同事系统工程师Martin
    Baines那里吸收了很多关于网络和角色的技术方面的知识，我们一起开着酷炫的公司车在整个地区奔波（我有一辆雪铁龙BX 16V）销售一个非常热门的产品。公司和团队随着时间的推移变得越来越大，但最初的销售团队由Paul
    Martin（福特Sierra Cosworth - 英格兰东部最快的销售人员）、Martin Harris（路虎发现-招募了一个充气骷髅作为额外的销售人员）、David
    Morley（沃克斯豪尔卡尔顿-总是在Newmarket的赛马上打赌）和Gary Littlefair（宝马320 - 多年来都完成了超过目标的200%，因为我们把英国电信拉到了Sun英国最大的客户）,我们就像是“踢屁股，玩得开心”，就像Scott
    McNealy喜欢说的那样。我还定期去加利福尼亚的太阳总部参加培训课程，并在那里遇到了一些有趣的人，特别是来自纽约的Reynold Jabbour，他对人和技术都非常有洞察力，为东海岸的系统工程师团队工作，后来去了各种华尔街银行工作，到现在仍是我最亲密的朋友之一。
- en: I became the Sun UK local specialist in performance and hardware, and as Sun
    transitioned from a desktop workstation company to sell high end multiprocessor
    servers I was helping customers find and fix scalability problems. In 1991 I wrote
    a white paper on performance that was widely read, and in 1993 (with help from
    Brian Wong) that got me a job in the USA, working alongside Brian for Mike Briggs
    in technical product marketing. Another big jump, but now it was my job to run
    benchmarks in the lab, and write white papers that explained the new products
    to the world, as they were launched. I also learned how marketing worked, and
    began to build my presentation and training skills as I was sent around the world
    by Sun to teach workshops and speak at events. I was mostly coding in C, tuning
    FORTRAN, and when I needed to do a lot of data analysis of benchmark results used
    the S-PLUS statistics language, that is the predecessor to R. [I still code in

- en: One role I had for many years was to lead technical training events for the
    global specialist systems engineers, which we called the Ambassador Program. I
    had attended these events when I was based in the UK, but became one of the organizers.
    I had to setup a week of talks by all the relevant product teams, with a hundred
    or so of the most experienced systems engineers from all over the world as an
    audience. We had specializations in hardware, operating systems, databases, graphics,
    etc. At one point we had two conflicting high availability products from different
    teams, who weren’t cooperating. I deliberately scheduled them back to back at
    one event so they were all in the room at the same time, and the audience roasted
    them — as a result there were product and messaging changes. We’d sometimes manage
    to get Sun founder Andy Bechtolsheim to give us a talk, and he’d tell us far more
    than the product managers wanted us to know, about all the cool things he was
    working on that haven’t happened yet. [He hasn’t changed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9v0SzfzIZCo).
    So many global friendships were made that continue to today. I saw Erik Fisher
    last time I was in Budapest, and Constantin Gonzalez later became one of the first
    AWS solutions architects in Germany, too many names to mention...

    — 结果导致产品和消息发生了变化。有时我们设法请到 Sun 创始人 Andy Bechtolsheim 来给我们讲话，他会告诉我们远比产品经理希望我们知道的更多，关于他正在从事的所有酷炫的事情，而这些事情尚未发生。[他并没有改变](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9v0SzfzIZCo)。我们建立了许多至今仍持续的全球友谊。上次我在布达佩斯时见到了

    back to the office to tell my manager Mike Briggs. He was pleased, but also told
    me he was leaving that day, to be one of the first employees of NetApp, at the
    time I was shocked! We ended up hiring Phil Parkman to take over managing our
    group, which by then also included my friend Dave Fisk, who I still hang out with

- en: I’d been using the Internet since about 1984, for email and newsgroups, sharing
    files like my white papers via ftp sites, but in the early 1990’s the world wide
    web came along, and Sun was a very early adopter. Corporate IT had no idea what
    was going on, but someone got a T1 line hooked up and we put a spare desktop machine
    on it and set up [www.sun.com](https://web.archive.org/web/19961020014601/http://www.sun.com:80/)
    (link to archive from 1996). I ended up with root access helping Shane Sigler
    run the site around 1995–1996 when it was one of the very first corporate web
    sites. I learned about tuning systems for this new network connection intensive
    workload, helped Solaris engineering tune the network stack and helped customers
    run some of the early web properties. Mike Briggs suggested that Brian Wong and
    I write books, because then we’d have more influence on the engineering teams,
    which turned out to be excellent advice. Brian wrote [*Configuration and Capacity
    Planning for Sun Servers*](https://www.amazon.com/Configuration-Capacity-Planning-Solaris-Servers/dp/0133499529/),
    and I turned my collection of white papers into a book, [*Sun Performance and
    Tuning*,](https://www.amazon.com/Sun-Performance-Tuning-Java-Internet/dp/0130952494)
    which became widely read, and published a monthly Q&A column at SunWorld Online.

    是其中一个非常早期的采用者。企业 IT 部门完全不知道发生了什么，但有人安装了一个 T1 线路，我们将一台空余的台式机连接上并设置了 [www.sun.com](https://web.archive.org/web/19961020014601/http://www.sun.com:80/)（链接指向
    1996 年的存档）。大约在 1995-1996 年间，我获得了 root 权限，帮助 Shane Sigler 运行这个站点，当时它是最早期的企业网站之一。我学会了为这种新的网络连接密集型工作负载调整系统，帮助
    Solaris 工程团队调整网络堆栈，并帮助客户运行一些早期的网络属性。Mike Briggs 建议我和 Brian Wong 写书，因为那样我们会对工程团队产生更大的影响，事实证明这是一个很好的建议。Brian
    写了 [*《Sun 服务器配置和容量规划》*](https://www.amazon.com/Configuration-Capacity-Planning-Solaris-Servers/dp/0133499529/)，而我将我的白皮书集合成了一本书
    [*《Sun 性能与调优》*](https://www.amazon.com/Sun-Performance-Tuning-Java-Internet/dp/0130952494)，这本书广受欢迎，并在

- en: Brian Wong started a “rotation program” that he and I ran for many years, with
    admin help and funding from Barb Hill, where we would borrow a systems engineer
    from somewhere in the world for a month, and have them work with us benchmarking
    something or writing a paper. We made great friends and found some amazing talent
    this way, and so many people ended up getting hired into permanent roles that
    it was called the job donation program by some of the SE managers, who lost good
    people to the central teams, but were mostly happy to see them succeed.

    SE 经理称之为工作捐赠计划，他们失去了一些优秀的员工加入了中央团队，但大多数情况下，他们很高兴看到他们取得成功。
- en: Rich Pettit is one of the best programmers I ever met. He turned up on a month
    long rotation one Monday in 1993, took a look at a complicated Perl script Brian
    had written to try to capture some tuning ideas, and decided to use lex and yacc
    to write a dedicated language to make it easier. He had it up and running on Wednesday.
    I adopted the language, called the [SE Toolkit](https://sourceforge.net/projects/setoolkit/),
    which was a C-based interpreter that understood how to directly read all the performance
    data out of the kernel, and wrote a lot of scripts over the years, including one
    called virtual_adrian.se that a lot of people used. The SE toolkit was fast, had
    no memory leaks (monitoring scripts could run for years) and let me implement
    lots of cool performance monitoring ideas. Rich became co-author of the second
    edition of the Sun Performance Tuning book, to describe how it worked.

    C 的解释器，可以直接读取内核中的所有性能数据，并在多年中编写了许多脚本，包括一个叫做 virtual_adrian.se 的脚本，许多人都在使用。SE 工具包运行速度快，没有内存泄漏（监视脚本可以运行多年），并让我实现了许多很酷的性能监控想法。Rich

    a few times. He became a leading expert in Solaris multi-threading. Jim Mauro
    and Allan Packer visited on rotation from New Jersey, and Adelaide Australia,
    and worked out how to produce a database sizing guide for Oracle Financials, which
    I wrote up and published. It was the first database sizing guide Sun had ever
    produced. Allan moved to the USA for several years to work on database performance
    and wrote the book [*Configuring and Tuning Databases on the Solaris Platform*](https://www.amazon.com/Configuring-Tuning-Databases-Solaris-Platform/dp/0130834173/).

    No-one could believe how much he got done in a month, building several tools including
    one that could lay out the entire memory usage of a machine in a way no one had
    ever seen before. A bit later our manager asked Brian and I who we should hire
    next, and we both said Richard. He wanted someone easier to hire than an international
    relocation, but in the end we made it happen. Later on Richard teamed up with
    Jim Mauro to write the [*Solaris Internals*](https://www.amazon.com/Solaris%C2%BF-Internals-Vol-Jim-Mauro/dp/0130224960/)

    machine code execution path and find which branches were being predicted wrong,
    then wrote another awk script to flip the branch prediction bits in memory and
    it showed a significant speedup. It was a memorable jaw drop moment for a room

    Bourbonnais 以及弗吉尼亚州的 Bob Sneed 合作过，我们进行了一个我们的数据中心设计师 Rob Snevely (他著有一本包含 Elizabeth
    Purcell 撰写的章节的 [Blueprint 书籍](https://www.amazon.com/Enterprise-Data-Center-Design-Methodology/dp/0130473936/)）称之为“万花筒项目”的工程，我们在这个项目中会安装和运行大型服务器配置的性能测试，这些配置比工程团队通常运行的测试或基准环境更接近客户端且更复杂。我们发现了许多无法正确配合的事情，提交了很多
    Bug，并解决了许多客户问题。我们将这称为“融化防范”，并且不得不努力让人们意识到近乎失灾也是值得追踪的。
- en: In the early 2000s, Sun was designing it’s next generation high end server,
    and to avoid reliability issues that had caused problems in previous systems,
    adopted Six Sigma to create quality best practices. I was looking for a new challenge,
    so joined the program and ended up getting certified as a “black belt”. It was
    like an intense and very technical MBA, re-learning a lot of the statistics I’d
    forgotten from my degree, along with courses in change management, requirements
    analysis, failure modeling, and other things I still find useful today. I worked
    with the engineering team that was designing the backplane connector, but the
    project was eventually cancelled when Sun ran out of money. I also applied [Six
    Sigma to capacity planning](https://www.slideshare.net/adrianco/capacity-planning-for-virtualized-datacenters-sun-network-2003-presentation)
    and presented this at a conference in 2003.

  zh: 早在 2000 年代初，Sun 公司正在设计其下一代高端服务器，为了避免之前系统中出现的可靠性问题，采用了 Six Sigma 方法来创建最佳质量实践。我当时正在寻找新的挑战，所以加入了这个项目，并最终获得了“黑带”认证。这就像是一个非常紧张和技术含量极高的
    MBA，重新学习了我在学士学位中忘记的很多统计知识，以及关于变更管理、需求分析、故障建模等课程，这些知识至今仍然对我很有用。我曾与负责设计背板连接器的工程团队一起工作，但当
    Sun 公司资金告罄时，该项目最终被取消了。我还将 [Six Sigma 方法应用于容量规划](https://www.slideshare.net/adrianco/capacity-planning-for-virtualized-datacenters-sun-network-2003-presentation)，并在
    2003 年的一次会议上做了演讲。
- en: One fun side project I got involved in was that Sun provided the back end server
    systems for the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, and I joined the effort
    as the capacity planning consultant, to make sure nothing would go wrong when
    the events were live. I used some custom monitoring tools I’d built over the years
    as part of Rich Pettit’s SE Toolkit, that included a tool called virtual-adrian,
    which implemented all the ideas I had come up with. Nothing went wrong, I got
    to see some events, and got very cold at times. I also helped out in the run-up
    to the 2004 Athens Olympics.

  zh: 我参与的一个有趣的附加项目是，Sun 公司为 2002 年 Salt Lake City 冬季奥运会提供了后端服务器系统，我加入了这个项目作为容量规划顾问，以确保活动进行时一切都不会出错。我使用了多年来作为
    Rich Pettit 的 SE Toolkit 的一部分构建的一些自定义监控工具，其中包括一个名为 virtual-adrian 的工具，它实现了我想到的所有想法。一切都进行得很顺利，我看到了一些比赛，有时感觉非常寒冷。我还在
    2004 年雅典奥运会前的准备工作中提供了帮助。
- en: The last role I had at Sun was as Chief Architect for the High Performance Technical
    Computing team led by Shahin Khan, we had fun and he was one of the best managers
    I’ve had, developing me in lots of different directions. At some point our product
    boss left, and I took over the role, so I spent a year or two learning how to
    be the product manager for our high performance computing and high end graphics
    product lines. I was also working alongside a very experienced Business Development
    Manager, Susanna Kass, to setup relationships with many internal and external
    partners, and got a good insight into how BD works. The team partnered with Sun’s
    director of standards Carl Cargill, as Sun and Oracle created a new standards
    body, the Enterprise Grid Alliance. I worked as the main representative for Sun,
    and on our competing relationship with the IBM dominated Global Grid Forum. I
    got Paul Strong involved in the EGA before I left Sun, the two competing bodies
    eventually merged, and Grid and Web Services evolved into Cloud Computing. We
    were thinking about the trends that eventually became cloud computing when AWS
    launched it, but Sun didn’t have the right business model to go direct to developers
    and sell capacity on a credit card, which is how AWS bypassed the resistance from
    corporate CIOs that we saw at Sun. This job stretched me in many different ways
    and we were having a good time, but by then Sun was shrinking and one of the many
    layoffs included our entire team.

  zh: 我在Sun的最后一个角色是作为由Shahin Khan领导的高性能技术计算团队的首席架构师，我们很开心，他是我遇到过的最好的经理之一，让我在很多不同的方向上发展。在某个时候，我们的产品负责人离开了，我接替了这个角色，所以我花了一两年的时间学习如何成为我们的高性能计算和高端图形产品线的产品经理。我还与一位非常有经验的业务发展经理Susanna
    Kass一起工作，与许多内部和外部合作伙伴建立关系，并深入了解了BD的运作方式。该团队与Sun的标准主管Carl Cargill合作，因为Sun和Oracle创建了一个新的标准组织，即企业网格联盟。我担任Sun的主要代表，并在我们与IBM主导的全球网格论坛的竞争关系上工作。在我离开Sun之前，我让Paul
    Strong参与了EGA，这两个竞争团体最终合并，网格和Web服务演变成了云计算。当AWS推出云计算时，我们正在思考最终成为云计算的趋势，但Sun没有正确的商业模式直接面向开发人员销售信用卡上的容量，这就是AWS如何绕过我们在Sun看到的企业CIO的抵制的。这份工作在很多不同的方面对我进行了拉伸，我们过得很愉快，但那时Sun正在缩减规模，其中一次裁员包括我们整个团队。
- en: We had just launched our main HPC product at an event in Shanghai, racks of
    Intel Linux based compute nodes using a SPARC Solaris server to configure it and
    provide storage, with Infiniband or Ethernet connectivity, Sun Grid Engine etc.
    While I was there, we heard that there were layoffs coming, but that everyone
    thought our team was still needed. On the way back I went to a Global Grid Forum
    meeting in Honolulu, representing EGA, and met Vikas Deolaliker, who said it looked
    as if no-one could find the head count to save the HPC team. I remember sitting
    in a bar with Savas Parastatidis and Jim Webber (now CTO of Neo4j) and telling
    them what was going on, then later that night starting an email thread with Maynard
    Webb, COO of eBay, on the pretext that eBay should start a new line of business
    auctioning compute capacity on demand, but really fishing for a job…

  zh: 我们刚刚在上海的一次活动上推出了我们的主要HPC产品，使用了一排Intel Linux基础的计算节点，使用SPARC Solaris服务器进行配置和提供存储，配备Infiniband或以太网连接，Sun
    Grid Engine等。当我在那里时，我们听说即将有裁员，但每个人都认为我们的团队仍然是必需的。在回程路上，我去了檀香山参加了全球网格论坛的会议，代表EGA，遇到了Vikas
    Deolaliker，他说似乎没有人能找到足够的人手来拯救HPC团队。我记得和Savas Parastatidis和Jim Webber（现任Neo4j的CTO）坐在酒吧里告诉他们发生了什么事情，然后在那个晚上与eBay的COO
    Maynard Webb开始了一封邮件线索，假装eBay应该开始一个新的业务线，即按需拍卖计算能力，但实际上是在找工作...
- en: So in mid-2004 I was laid off, looking for a change and decided to get out of
    the business of selling computers to big companies and figure out consumer oriented
    technology at eBay. I’d helped eBay recover from capacity related outages in 1999
    and had setup their capacity planning processes. I had also turned down a job
    offer at that time, but they took me on this time as a Distinguished Engineer
    in their Operations Architecture team.
