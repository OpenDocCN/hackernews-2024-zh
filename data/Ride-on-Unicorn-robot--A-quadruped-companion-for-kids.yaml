- en: The latent potential for personal robotics became very real for me while I was
    strolling the halls of the [45th Bangkok International Motor Show](https://www.motorshow.in.th/en/home-en/)
    this week. There are always good ideas at motor shows, except the good ideas at
    motor shows in developing regions seem to be far more affordable and practical
    than they are in more advanced economies ... and once more the Bangkok Motor Show
    delivered a pearl.

  zh: 当我漫步于本周的[第45届曼谷国际车展](https://www.motorshow.in.th/en/home-en/)的展馆时，个人机器人潜在的潜力变得非常真实。车展上总有好点子，只是在发展中国家的车展上，这些好点子似乎比更发达经济体中的更加实惠和实用...曼谷车展再次带来了一个珍珠。
- en: The star of the show for the attendees was unquestionably the XPeng flying car
    prototype that begins production in 2025\. It was the first time Thailand had
    seen a flying car in the flesh, though XPeng's rise as a credible challenger to
    Tesla and its insistence that the 2025 production date is solid clearly added
    to the narrative. The excitement is that a flying car will soon be attainable,
    if not quite affordable.

  zh: 对参展者而言，焦点无疑是2025年开始生产的XPeng飞行汽车原型。这是泰国第一次见到真正的飞行汽车，尽管XPeng作为特斯拉的可信竞争对手的崛起和其坚定的2025年生产日期显然增强了叙事性。令人兴奋的是，飞行汽车很快将变得可得，尽管价格可能并不那么实惠。

- en: Hence it’s understandable that the flying car of parent company Xpeng got all
    the attention from the media. Xiaopeng Motors (known as XPeng) was founded just
    over a decade ago in Guangzhou, but growth has been rapid, funding has been forthcoming
    and in 2020, [the company went public on the New York Stock Exchange](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/XPEV?p=XPEV&.tsrc=fin-srch),
    raising US$1.5 billion.

  zh: 因此，毫无疑问，XPeng的飞行汽车吸引了媒体的所有关注。小鹏汽车（XPeng）创立于广州刚过十年，但增长迅速，获得了充足的资金。2020年，[该公司在纽约证券交易所上市](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/XPEV?p=XPEV&.tsrc=fin-srch)，筹集了15亿美元。

    no video screen, indeed there was no information about what it was at all. Not
    surprisingly, no-one was paying the robotic Great Dane any attention.

- en: The idea of a quadruped companion for children had been shown as a concept 18
    months ago, but at that time the gargantuan looming presence of practical Artificial
    Intelligence had not been recognized and although the idea of the quadruped offering
    a pony-like experience was novel, I think most people consigned it to the same
    booty-shaking companion category as Sony's Aibo and a battalion of other quadruped
    robots under development around the world.

- en: The first thing we need to recognize is that by turning the unicorn's tail into
    a miniature industrial-quality robotic arm, the practicality of the Unicorn has
    made a quantum forward leap. Though details are difficult to pin down, my understanding
    is that the tail will be capable of grasping, lifting and carrying objects up
    to 3 kg and we can clearly see that development on all fronts in the XPeng empire
    appears to be at blitzkrieg pace, so as the software develops for such fetch and
    carry capabilities, genuine usefulness appears likely.

  zh: 我们需要首先认识到的是，通过将独角兽的尾巴变成一个微型工业级机械臂，独角兽的实用性已经实现了量子级的飞跃。虽然细节难以确定，但我理解尾巴将能够抓取、举起和搬运重达3公斤的物体，我们可以清楚地看到XPeng帝国在各个方面的发展速度非常迅猛，因此随着为这种拿取和搬运能力开发的软件，其真正的实用性似乎很有可能。
- en: Being able to say to your unicorn companion, "can you pass me the 5/8 open ender
    please" when you're wedged under a car might be just the start. XPeng is intent
    on leveraging the burgeoning capability of Artificial Intelligence and the Unicorn
    now looks to have the framework to become an intelligent, articulate and physically
    capable collaborator in almost any endeavor you can think of.
