    available. The Apple Vision Pro offers two innovations in one: a virtual-reality
    (VR) headset with a higher resolution than most others on the market, and an array
    of augmented-reality (AR) cameras that allow a wearer to see ordinary computer
    applications floating in space, and to interact with them via hand gestures. To
    make the AR work, a knob on the top of the device can dial back your level of
    “immersion” in a simulated space and replace it with a live video feed of your
    surroundings, overlaid in real time with computer programs: web browsers, spreadsheets,
    photo viewers, Disney+. It’s this latter function that most distinguishes the
    device from other headsets—and from other machines in general. Computers help
    people work, live, and play, but they also separate us from the world. Apple Vision
    Pro strives to end that era and inaugurate a new one.'

    Vision Pro集虚拟现实（VR）头戴式设备和市场上大多数其他设备都具备的更高分辨率的增强现实（AR）摄像头于一体，戴着它可以看到普通电脑应用程序在空中漂浮，并通过手势与之交互。为了使增强现实生效，设备顶部的旋钮可以调节您在模拟空间中的“沉浸感”水平，并用实时叠加计算机程序的现场视频替代之：如网络浏览器、电子表格、照片查看器、Disney+等。正是后一功能最使该设备与其他头戴式设备——以及一般的其他机器——区分开来。计算机帮助人们工作、生活和娱乐，但它们也将我们与世界隔离开来。Apple
    Vision Pro力图结束那个时代，并开启一个新时代。
