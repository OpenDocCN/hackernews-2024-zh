- en: You’re familiar with Karel Čapek, right? If not, you should be—he’s the guy
    who (along with his brother Josef) invented the word “robot.” Čapek introduced
    robots to the world in 1921, when his play “*R.U.R.*” (subtitled “Rossum’s Universal
    Robots”) was first performed in Prague. It was performed in New York City the
    next year, and by the year after that, it had been translated into 30 languages.
    Translated, that is, except for the word “robot” itself, which originally described
    artificial humans but within a decade of its introduction came to mean things
    that were mechanical and electronic in nature.

  zh: 你熟悉卡雷尔·查佩克，对吧？如果不熟悉，你应该了解一下——他是那个（与他的兄弟约瑟夫一起）发明“机器人”一词的人。1921年，查佩克在布拉格首次上演了他的戏剧《*R.U.R.*》（副标题为“Rossum's
    Universal Robots”）。次年在纽约上演，再过一年，它就被翻译成了30种语言。翻译成其他语言，这个词除外，这个词最初是指人造人类，但在引入后的十年内，它的意义扩展到了机械和电子设备。
- en: Čapek, it turns out, was a little miffed that his “robots” had been so hijacked,
    and in 1935, he wrote a column in the [*Lidové noviny*](https://www.lidovky.cz/)
    “defending” his vision of what robots should be, while also resigning himself
    to what they had become. A new translation of this column is included as an afterword
    in a new English translation of *R.U.R.* that is accompanied by 20 essays exploring
    [robotics](https://spectrum.ieee.org/topic/robotics/), philosophy, politics, and
    AI in the context of the play, and it makes for fascinating reading.

  zh: Čapek发现，他的“机器人”被如此篡改，有点不太高兴，因此在1935年，他在[*Lidové noviny*](https://www.lidovky.cz/)上写了一篇专栏文章“辩护”他对机器人的愿景，同时也接受了它们的现状。这篇专栏文章的新翻译被作为《R.U.R.》的新英文翻译的后记收录，后者附带了20篇探讨[机器人技术](https://spectrum.ieee.org/topic/robotics/)、哲学、政治和人工智能的文章，在这个剧本的背景下，这些文章令人着迷。

    at the [Chemical Robotics Laboratory](https://chobotix.cz/) at the University
    of Chemistry and Technology Prague, whose research interests arguably make her
    one of the most qualified people to write about Čapek’s perspective on robots.
    “The chemical robots in the form of microparticles that we designed and investigated,
    and that had properties similar to living cells, were much closer to Čapek’s original
    ideas than any other robots today,” Čejková explains in the book’s introduction.
    These microparticles can exhibit surprisingly complex autonomous behaviors under
    specific situations, like solving simple mazes:'

    robots were artificial human beings that only looked like humans and could imitate
    only certain characteristics and behaviors of humans, so liquid robots, as artificial
    cells, only partially imitate the behavior of their living counterparts.”

- en: 'What is or is not called a robot is an ongoing debate that most roboticists
    seem to try to avoid, but personally, I appreciate the idea that very broadly,
    a robot is something that seems alive but isn’t—something with independent embodied
    intelligence. Perhaps the requirement that a robot is mechanical and electronic
    *is* too strict, although as Čapek himself realized 100 years ago, what defines
    a robot has escaped from the control of anyone, even its creator. Here then is

- en: I know it is a sign of ingratitude on the part of the author, if he raises both
    hands against a certain popularity that has befallen something which is called
    his spiritual brainchild; for that matter, he is aware that by doing so he can
    no longer change a thing. The author was silent a goodly time and kept his own
    counsel, while the notion that robots have limbs of metal and innards of wire
    and cogwheels (or the like) has become current; he has learned, without any great
    pleasure, that genuine steel robots have started to appear, robots that move in
    various directions, tell the time, and even fly airplanes; but when he recently
    read that, in Moscow, they have shot a major film, in which the world is trampled
    underfoot by mechanical robots, driven by electromagnetic waves, he developed
    a strong urge to protest, at least in the name of his own robots. For his robots
    were not mechanisms. They were not made of sheet metal and cogwheels. They were
    not a celebration of mechanical engineering. If the author was thinking of any
    of the marvels of the human spirit during their creation, it was not of technology,
    but of science. With outright horror, he refuses any responsibility for the thought
    that machines could take the place of people, or that anything like life, love,
    or rebellion could ever awaken in their cogwheels. He would regard this somber
    vision as an unforgivable overvaluation of mechanics or as a severe insult to
    life.

  zh: 我知道，作者站出来反对某种被称为他的精神子女所遭受的某种普遍支持是不感激的表现；此事是了解到，他再也不能改变任何事情。作者沉默了很长时间并保持自己的看法，当“机器人拥有金属的四肢和电线和齿轮（或类似的东西）”的想法变得流行起来；他无甚快乐地得知，真正的钢铁机器人已经开始出现，这些机器人可以四处移动，报时，甚至驾驶飞机；但最近当他看到在莫斯科，他们拍摄了一部重大电影，里面描述了世界被由电磁波驱动的机械机器人践踏的情景时，他产生了强烈的抗议欲望，至少为了他自己的机器人而抗议。因为他的机器人不是机械装置。它们不是由薄铁片和齿轮制成的。它们并不是对机械工程的庆祝。如果作者在创造它们时考虑到人类精神的奇迹，那一定不是技术，而是科学。他毫不犹豫地拒绝对机械取代人类的想法，或者对它们的齿轮里会觉醒出任何生命、爱或反叛的想法负任何责任。他认为这种黑暗的愿景是对机械学的不可饶恕的高估，或者对生命的严重侮辱。
- en: 'The author of the robots appeals to the fact that he must know the most about
    it: and therefore he pronounces that his robots were created quite differently—that
    is, by a chemical path. The author was thinking about modern chemistry, which
    in various emulsions (or whatever they are called) has located substances and
    forms that in some ways behave like living matter. He was thinking about biological
    chemistry, which is constantly discovering new chemical agents that have a direct
    regulatory influence on living matter; about chemistry, which is finding—and to
    some extent already building—those various enzymes, hormones, and vitamins that
    give living matter its ability to grow and multiply and arrange all the other
    necessities of life. Perhaps, as a scientific layman, he might develop an urge
    to attribute this patient ingenious scholarly tinkering with the ability to one
    day produce, by artificial means, a living cell in the test tube; but for many
    reasons, amongst which also belonged a respect for life, he could not resolve
    to deal so frivolously with this mystery. That is why he created a new kind of
    matter by chemical synthesis, one which simply behaves a lot like the living;
    it is an organic substance, different from that from which living cells are made;
    it is something like another alternative to life, a material substrate in which
    life could have evolved if it had not, from the beginning, taken a different path.
    We do not have to suppose that all the different possibilities of creation have
    been exhausted on our planet. The author of the robots would regard it as an act
    of scientific bad taste if he had brought something to life with brass cogwheels
    or created life in the test tube; the way he imagined it, he created only a new
    foundation for life, which began to behave like living matter, and which could
    therefore have become a vehicle of life—but a life which remains an unimaginable
    and incomprehensible mystery. This life will reach its fulfillment only when (with
    the aid of considerable inaccuracy and mysticism) the robots acquire souls. From
    which it is evident that the author did not invent his robots with the technological
    hubris of a mechanical engineer, but with the metaphysical humility of a spiritualist.'

  zh: 机器人的作者诉诸于他必须对其了解最多的事实：因此他断言他的机器人是以完全不同的方式创建的——也就是说，通过化学途径。作者考虑了现代化学，通过各种乳状液（或者它们被称为什么）已经确定了一些在某些方面行为类似于生物物质的物质和形式。他考虑了生物化学，它不断地发现对生物物质有直接调节作用的新化学物质；考虑了正在发现——并在某种程度上已经在构建——那些赋予生物物质生长、繁殖和安排所有其他生活必需品能力的各种酶、激素和维生素的化学。也许，作为一个科学上的外行，他可能会产生一种渴望，将这种耐心的巧妙的学者式的小把戏归因于有一天能够通过人工手段在试管中产生一个活细胞的能力；但出于许多原因，其中也包括对生命的尊重，他不能决心如此轻浮地处理这个谜。这就是为什么他通过化学合成创造了一种新型物质，这种物质简单地行为很像生命；它是一种有机物质，不同于构成生命细胞的物质；它有点像生命的另一种选择，一种材料基质，在其中生命本可以进化，如果从一开始就没有走上不同的道路的话。我们不必假设在我们的星球上所有不同的创造可能性都已经耗尽。如果他用黄铜齿轮赋予了生命，或者在试管中创造了生命，那么机器人的作者会认为这是一种科学上的坏品味；他想象的方式是，他只创造了一种新的生命基础，它开始行为像生物物质，因此可以成为生命的载体——但是一种生命仍然是不可想象和无法理解的神秘。只有当（在相当不准确和神秘的帮助下）机器人获得灵魂时，这种生命才会实现其目标。由此可见，作者并不像机械工程师那样带有技术傲慢地发明他的机器人，而是像灵魂主义者那样带有形而上学的谦卑。
- en: 'Well then, the author cannot be blamed for what might be called the worldwide
    humbug over the robots. The author did not intend to furnish the world with plate
    metal dummies stuffed with cogwheels, photocells, and other mechanical gizmos.
    It appears, however, that the modern world is not interested in his scientific
    robots and has replaced them with technological ones; and these are, as is apparent,
    the true flesh-of-our-flesh of our age. The world needed mechanical robots, for
    it believes in machines more than it believes in life; it is fascinated more by
    the marvels of technology than by the miracle of life. For which reason, the author
    who wanted—through his insurgent robots, striving for a soul—to protest against
    the mechanical superstition of our times, must in the end claim something which
    nobody can deny him: the honor that he was defeated.'
