    state my thesis baldly at the beginning: there is a large overlap between the
    things that underpin long-standing worldwide birth-rate declines and the things
    that underpin our prosperity. As the biologist [John Aitken](https://x.com/post_liberal/status/1592969315032002560?s=46)
    has put it:- ‘The fundamental cause of human fertility decline is prosperity.’
    Therefore, birth-rate declines are hard to undo and reverse because to unpick
    low-fertility risks also unpicking our prosperity too. Therefore, pronatalists
    face an uphill battle, to put it mildly. [Pronatalism](https://thecritic.co.uk/political-fever-dreams/)
    (a term used to describe advocates for policies geared towards increasing fertility
    rates) is [nothing new](https://academic.oup.com/book/9729?login=false) but has
    gained greater salience in recent years due to rapidly rising [old age dependency
    ratios](https://x.com/post_liberal/status/1701281985962869161?s=46) across the
    OECD countries in particular. [The Economist](https://x.com/post_liberal/status/1575283606364340225?s=46)
    reports that the share of countries with pro-natalist policies has grown from
    20% in 2005 to 28% in 2019\. In any analysis of the merits or demerits of pronatalism
    it is important to differentiate between liberal and illiberal forms of pronatalism.
    In its illiberal guise, pronatalism can be motivated by an ugly ethno-nationalist
    undercurrent which views pronatalism as a means of avoiding what it perceives
    to be the evils of mass-immigration, which is seen in catastrophic terms as tantamount
    to ethnic replacement and racial/civilisational suicide. But this form of pronatalism
    is, at best, a fringe view in this country and I''m not going to waste my time
    critiquing a set of views which are not held by anyone with any real influence
    or power.'

  zh: 关于全球出生率下降的问题是一个复杂的议题，但我将在开始时直截了当地阐述我的论点：导致长期全球出生率下降的因素与我们繁荣的基础存在重叠。正如生物学家[约翰·艾特肯](https://x.com/post_liberal/status/1592969315032002560?s=46)所说：“人类生育率下降的根本原因是繁荣。”
    因此，出生率下降难以逆转，因为想要解决低生育率问题也就意味着解决我们的繁荣问题。因此，赞生主义者面临一场严峻的斗争，姑且这么说吧。[赞生主义](https://thecritic.co.uk/political-fever-dreams/)（这个术语用来描述支持提高生育率政策的倡导者）并非什么新鲜事物，但由于OECD国家老龄化依赖比例的迅速上升，近年来变得更加重要。[《经济学人》](https://x.com/post_liberal/status/1575283606364340225?s=46)报道称，支持赞生主义政策的国家比例从2005年的20%增长到2019年的28%。在对赞生主义的优缺点进行分析时，重要的是区分自由和非自由形式的赞生主义。在其非自由形式中，赞生主义可能受到丑陋的族裔民族主义潜流的驱使，后者将赞生主义视为避免大规模移民的手段，这被视为族裔替代和种族/文明自杀的一种灾难性形式。但是这种形式的赞生主义充其量只是在这个国家的一个边缘观点，并且我不打算浪费时间批评那些没有任何真正影响力或权力的观点。
- en: My critique is aimed at the less sinister and more liberal form of pronatalism
    which holds sway over a greater swathe of policy-makers. There are [bad-faith
    critics](https://x.com/post_liberal/status/1579053777021440000?s=46) who will
    try to collapse the two forms of pronatalism into one and pretend that all forms
    of pronatalism are inherently morally suspect, but this is not a view I subscribe
    to. My critique of liberal pronatalism is not that it is inherently morally problematic
    to utilise various policies to try to encourage more people to have children. 
    Pronatalism, in its liberal form, is a perfectly legitimate set of policy aims.
    My argument is pragmatic, not moralistic. My argument is that liberal pronatalism
    is simply not going to work. As the authors of [Empty Planet’](https://amzn.eu/c2g6hA1)
    explain:- ‘the “low-fertility trap” ensures that, once having one or two children
    becomes the norm, it stays the norm. Couples no longer see having children as
    a duty they must perform to satisfy their obligation to their families or their
    god. Rather, they choose to raise a child as an act of personal fulfilment. And
    they are quickly fulfilled.’

  zh: 我的批评针对的是更少阴谋性、更自由形式的生育主义，这种形式影响了更广泛的政策制定者。有些[恶意批评者](https://x.com/post_liberal/status/1579053777021440000?s=46)试图将两种形式的生育主义合二为一，并假装所有形式的生育主义在道德上都是有问题的，但这不是我认同的观点。我对自由生育主义的批评并不在于利用各种政策试图鼓励更多人生孩子本身就有道德问题。自由生育主义在其自由形式下，是一组完全合法的政策目标。我的论点是务实的，而非道德化的。我的论点是自由生育主义根本不会奏效。正如《空星球》的作者们解释的那样：“‘低生育陷阱’确保了一旦把生育一到两个孩子作为常态，它就会保持常态。夫妻们不再把生孩子看作是他们必须履行以满足对家庭或神的义务的义务，而是选择抚养孩子作为个人成就的一种行动。而他们很快就能实现。”
- en: My critique of liberal pronatalism also seeks to avoid falling into the trap
    of dichotomising economic versus cultural factors, a tendency which tends to obscure,
    rather than illuminate, analysis of fertility trends. For instance, [urbanisation](https://x.com/post_liberal/status/1518223866430164993?s=46)
    is associated with birth-rate declines (current estimates indicate that [70%](https://x.com/post_liberal/status/1742148515722104949?s=46)
    of the world’s population will be living in urban locales by 2070 and it's already
    at [83%](https://x.com/post_liberal/status/1394918007307227138?s=46) in the UK)
    but is urbanisation a cultural factor or an economic factor? a bit of both is
    the answer. Economics ***or*** culture is therefore a false dichotomy. In predominantly
    rural societies, children are an extra pair of hands and an insurance policy against
    old age and sickness when there are no social safety nets, so, in that sense,
    an economic factor. I once worked with a West African lady (who had been born
    and raised in a rural location) who described her five children as literally her
    “pension.” This is a vivid illustration of the ways in which children are viewed
    as economic assets in predominantly rural societies and stands in stark contrast
    to urbanised societies, such as the UK, where children are widely viewed primarily
    in terms of being an economic cost, rather than an extra pair of hands  and an
    insurance against old age and sickness. In industrial and postindustrial societies,
    complete with extensive social safety nets, and with work located away from home
    in a factory or in an office, as opposed to at home on a smallholding or a farm,
    the economic equation of having children is fundamentally altered.

  zh: 我对自由生育主义的批评也力求避免陷入经济与文化因素的对立陷阱，这种倾向往往会使生育趋势的分析变得晦涩难懂，而非启发人心。例如，[城市化](https://x.com/post_liberal/status/1518223866430164993?s=46)与出生率下降相关（目前的估计表明，到2070年全球[70%](https://x.com/post_liberal/status/1742148515722104949?s=46)的人口将居住在城市地区，而在英国已经达到[83%](https://x.com/post_liberal/status/1394918007307227138?s=46)），但城市化是文化因素还是经济因素？答案是两者皆有。因此，经济***或***文化是一种虚假的二元对立。在主要是农村社会中，孩子是额外的帮手，也是在没有社会保障网时老年和疾病的保险，因此在这个意义上，是经济因素。我曾与一位西非女士（出生并在农村长大）合作，她把自己的五个孩子形象地称为她的“养老金”。这清楚地说明了在主要是农村社会中孩子被视为经济资产的方式，与英国等城市化社会截然不同，那里孩子主要被视为经济负担，而不是额外的帮手和老年疾病的保险。在工业化和后工业化社会，配备完善社会保障网，并且工作场所位于工厂或办公室而非家中的小农场，孩子带来的经济影响发生了根本性的变化。
- en: However, cultural factors are also at play. When large families are the social
    norm within a culture then this has a tendency to become mutually reinforcing.
    Having a small family, or no children at all, when everyone else around you are
    having large families, automatically makes you the odd one out. Humans are social
    creatures with an instinct to conform and this creates a degree of path-dependency
    with respect to fertility-levels, which can make them difficult to change without
    a fundamental alteration in material circumstances. Additionally, people in rural
    societies are more likely to live near an extended family-network. Whereas in
    urban societies, with its greater degree of geographical mobility, population
    churn and [social dislocation](https://x.com/david_goodhart/status/1465379979202551810?s=46),
    proximal family networks tend to be replaced with co-workers and university friends
    and the like. As the authors of [‘Empty Planet](https://amzn.eu/2SP8GXG)’ explain,
    this has ramifications for fertility because ‘family members encourage each other
    to have children, whereas non-kin don’t.’

  zh: 然而，文化因素也起了作用。当大家庭是文化中的社会规范时，这往往会相互强化。在一个文化中，如果大家都在生大家庭，而你只有一个小家庭，或者根本没有孩子，那么你就自动成了异类。人类是社会性动物，有一种顺应的本能，这造成了在生育水平上的路径依赖性，这种情况在没有根本性的物质变化的情况下很难改变。此外，农村社会的人更有可能生活在一个扩展家庭网络附近。而在城市社会中，由于其更大的地理流动性、人口流动和[社会脱节](https://x.com/david_goodhart/status/1465379979202551810?s=46)，亲属家庭网络往往被同事和大学朋友等所取代。正如《空星球》的作者们解释的那样，这对生育率产生了影响，因为‘家庭成员互相鼓励生孩子，而非亲属则不会’。

    is a real phenomenon. [Research](https://phys.org/news/2019-05-grandmother-effect-proximity-factor-family.html)
    has demonstrated that having a living maternal grandmother increases the number
    of offspring born by their daughters by about 20% whilst another [study](https://x.com/rebeccasear/status/1374984781423902723?s=46)
    found that a grandparental death leads to a reduction of approximately 5 percentage
    points in the five-year probability of childbirth amongst their offspring. The
    [grandmother effect](https://www.ubishops.ca/the-grandmother-effect-a-crucial-role-in-demographic-evolution-collaboration-between-universite-de-sherbrooke-and-bishops/)
    gives us an insight into some of the cultural factors which underpin higher fertility
    rates in predominantly rural societies, given that in rural areas people are more
    likely, on average, to live near [extended famil](https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2022/05/18/more-than-half-of-americans-live-within-an-hour-of-extended-family/#:~:text=Roughly%20six-in-ten%20adults,and%2050%%20in%20urban%20areas.)y

    of parental support with adult daughters' entry into parenthood](https://x.com/leapessin/status/1410266337834831880?s=46).
    Birth control, as a technological factor, is another good example of the false
    dichotomy between economics versus culture as regards analysing fertility trends.
    Birth control measures, such as condoms or the pill, are a material issue, but
    their take-up is influenced by cultural factors. We can see this quite clearly
    with respect to the British total fertility rate which fell in [1877](https://t.co/ozMIaBK8dz)
    due to a change to social norms when a book about birth control triggered a controversial
    censorship trial. Birth control is a material factor, but the take up of various
    forms of birth control are influenced by changes in social norms, which are [cultural](https://x.com/lymanstoneky/status/1117815316212359169?s=46).
    Needless to say, economics *versus* culture, as opposed to economics *via* culture,

    to maintain a sufficient working-age population.’ Ageing societies also risk calcifying
    into gerontocracies with rapidly increasing levels of intergenerational inequality.
    As an article in [The Times](https://x.com/post_liberal/status/1541767231838818306?s=46)
    put it, ‘a country with fewer children inevitably allocates more resources and
    more power to older people.’ Whilst [CapX](https://x.com/post_liberal/status/1640325610055639047?s=46)
    reports that in the UK ‘one in four pensioners is a millionaire, whilst the median
    pensioner….already has more disposable income than the median worker, and is likely
    to have greater wealth.’

    as the [demographic transition](https://ourworldindata.org/demographic-transition).
    The demographic transition started in North-West Europe around [1800](https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/089533003772034943)
    — the total fertility rate in [France](https://x.com/post_liberal/status/1753172770051989672?s=46),
    for instance, dropped by 20% between 1800 and 1870 alone —and has been slowly
    spreading outwards to the rest of the world since then. This demographic transition
    has been revolutionary in its implications. As demographer [Ronald Lee](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/089533003772034943)
    explains:- ‘before the start of the demographic transition, life was short, births
    were many, growth was slow and the population was young. During the transition,
    first mortality and then fertility declined, causing population growth rates first
    to accelerate and then to slow again, moving toward low fertility, long life and
    an old population. The transition began around 1800 with declining mortality in
    Europe. It has now spread to all parts of the world and is projected to be completed
    by 2100\. This global demographic transition has brought momentous changes, reshaping
    the economic and demographic life cycles of individuals and restructuring populations.
    Since 1800, global population size has already increased by a factor of six and
    by 2100 will have risen by a factor of ten. There will then be 50 times as many
    elderly, but only five times as many children; thus, the ratio of elders to children
    will have risen by a factor of ten. The length of life, which has already more
    than doubled, will have tripled, while births per woman will have dropped from
    six to two. In 1800, women spent about 70 percent of their adult years bearing
    and rearing young children, but that fraction has decreased in many parts of the
    world to only about 14 percent, due to lower fertility and longer life.’

    — 例如，在1800年至1870年间，单单法国的总生育率就下降了20% — 从那时起，这一人口转型逐渐向全世界其他地区扩展。这一人口转型在其影响方面具有革命性。正如人口统计学家[罗纳德·李](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/089533003772034943)所解释的那样：‘在人口转型开始之前，人们的寿命短，出生多，增长缓慢，人口年轻。在转型期间，首先是死亡率下降，然后是生育率下降，导致人口增长率先加快，然后再次减缓，向低生育率、长寿和老龄化发展。这一转型始于1800年代初期欧洲的死亡率下降。现在已经扩展到全世界各地，并预计到2100年将完成。这一全球人口转型带来了重大变化，重新塑造了个体的经济和人口统计生命周期，并重构了人口结构。自1800年以来，全球人口规模已经增长了六倍，到2100年将增长十倍。到那时，老年人将增加50倍，但只有五倍的儿童；因此，老年人口与儿童的比率将增加十倍。寿命已经翻了一番以上，将再增加两倍，而每个女性的生育率将从六个下降到两个。在1800年，妇女在成年期间大约70%的时间用于生育和抚养幼儿，但由于生育率降低和寿命延长，全球许多地区的这一比例已经降至约14%。

    a relentless, generation after generation culling of the human herd. Nothing like
    this has ever happened before…..Population decline isn’t a good thing or a bad
    thing. But it is a big thing. A child born today will reach middle age in a world
    in which conditions and expectations are very different from our own. She will
    find the planet more urban, with less crime, environmentally healthier but with
    many more old people. She won’t have trouble finding a job, but she may struggle
    to make ends meet, as taxes to pay for health care and pensions for all those
    seniors eat into her salary. There won’t be as many schools, because there won’t

    incentives alone explained fertility declines, irrespective of context, then it
    would be relatively easy to fix the problem, just bung a load of cash at people

    Part of the problem here, it seems to me, is that policy-wonk think-tank types
    are the ones who write about this subject more than anyone else and policy-wonk
    types are naturally inclined to emphasise aspects of the problem which might be
    amenable to policy-levers, which tend to be mostly economic, and to downplay things
    which are less amenable to change via policy, factors that tend to be mostly cultural.
    We rely on policy-wonks for their specific knowledge about particular subjects
    but they tend to have their own biases. One of which tends to be the belief that
    something can be done in regards to the particular problems that form the locus
    of their area of expertise. A policy-wonk is incentivised to always believe that
    something can be done with respect to their area of expertise because otherwise:
    what are they doing exactly? However, sometimes very little can realistically
    be done with respect to certain intractable problems. In the case of birth-rate
    declines, if the same factors that play a role in fostering birth-rate declines
    also play a role in fostering our prosperity then reversing those birth-rate declines
    will likely involve huge unattractive trade-offs that most people would be unwilling

    total fertility rates were actually a lot [higher when we were much poorer](https://x.com/post_liberal/status/1740816040203047365?s=46)

    ([three times as high in fact.](https://x.com/post_liberal/status/1753190642925138348?s=46))

    are often adduced as a primary factor behind declining birth rates in this country.

    example of Tokyo indicates that building more houses will not, in of itself, do

    culture actually looks like:- ‘compared with the rest of the world, sub-Saharan
    Africa has relatively high levels of illiteracy (34% in 2018) and low education.
    There are fewer economic opportunities and often restricted access to contraception.
    People in this world region are generally more religious, tend to have more traditional
    family values and fatalistic attitudes toward childbearing are widespread. Childbearing
    and marriage remain close to universal, and majorities marry at a relatively young
    age. Within marriages, childbearing is often expected and is the basis for legal,
    social, and cultural systems.’ A high-fertility culture would be one which was
    less [urban](https://x.com/post_liberal/status/1639703339620343810?s=46), more
    [religious](https://x.com/kbguzzo/status/1317146986903072770?s=46), probably with

    manifold educational and professional opportunities in the process. In a truly
    high-fertility culture, there would also likely be less emphasis on the importance
    of work and education in general too. Some people would welcome a retraditionalised
    society that was less urban, more [religious](https://x.com/degenrolf/status/1055059408881938432?s=46),

    and fewer economic opportunities.’ If these are the factors associated with high-fertility
    then most people would happily choose low-fertility. The reality is that the factors
    which underpin low-birth rate trends are also the factors which are inextricably
    linked with the prosperity of the countries with low birth-rates and therefore
    we can't easily unpick one without also risking the unravelling of the other.
    As [Vegard Skirbekk](https://amzn.eu/cCpI2lX) has written, ‘fertility tends to
    be higher in regions where the population is less educated, more religious, poorer,

    which industrialises and urbanises, it's not something that we can eradicate via
    policy-tinkering nor is it completely negative in every single respect. There
    are no easy answers to the problems that the low fertility trap poses and we would
    do well to be sceptical of anyone who proposes otherwise.
