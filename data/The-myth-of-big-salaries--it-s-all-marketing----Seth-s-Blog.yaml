    is paid has no real impact on their life. They can't eat more meals in a day or
    wear more shoes. What matters to the manager is the *relative* amount. How much
    more would I make over there? Why does that company pay its CEO more than my company
    pays me?

- en: 'Law firms went through this cycle twenty years ago. The top firms competed
    with each other to recruit a too-small pool of talent from the top law schools.
    Unable to muster up even a mite of marketing insight, they chose to compete on
    only one axis: salary. So, 24 year olds were given jobs at $120,000 a year, when
    their peers from college were making 20% of that. The firms could have found great
    people at half the price, except that with only one axis, they had to be at the
    top if their peers were.'

  zh: 二十年前，律师事务所经历了这样一个周期。顶尖律所互相竞争，从顶尖法学院招募数量太少的人才。由于他们无法提供市场洞察力，他们选择只在一个方面竞争：工资。所以，24岁的年轻人一年赚12万美元的工作，而他们从大学毕业后的同龄人只能拿到那个数字的20％。律所其实可以以一半的价格找到优秀的人才，但由于只有一条竞争线，他们必须处于顶端，就像他们的同行一样。
- en: If you were a law student, the choice was easy. Either you got a job at a firm
    that proved its worth by paying a lot or you didn't. You didn't have to know anything
    about the firm, apparently, other than the fact that they were top tier, and the
    way you knew that was because they paid a lot.

- en: Hence the current situation with CEOs and bankers. There's no real effort made
    to market the jobs, just to race to the top (or the bottom, depending on your
    point of view) with the easiest marketing signal of all. Price. Yes, it's exactly
    the same as a retailer trying to improve business by being the cheapest.

  zh: 因此，目前的情况涉及首席执行官和银行家。他们没有真正努力去营销这些工作，只是通过最简单的营销信号，即价格，来赛跑（或者说争夺最顶端或最底端的位置，这取决于你的观点）。是的，这与零售商试图通过提供最低价格来改善业务的做法完全相同。
- en: In addition to this being a huge (!) waste of money, it's also provably false
    as an accurate portrayal of what's necessary to recruit. For every great job at
    Goldman Sachs, there are still 1,000 totally qualified applicants waiting for
    that job. So, when demand is high and supply is low, the power goes to the supplier.
    Lower the salary until you get just a few qualified applicants, right?

  zh: 除了这是巨大的浪费 (!)外，作为对招聘必要性的准确描述也可以证明是错误的。在高盛银行每一个好工作背后，仍然有1000名完全合格的申请人在等待。所以，当需求高而供应低时，权力就掌握在供应者手中。降低薪水直到只有少数合格的申请人申请，对吧？
- en: This moment in our economic cycle is a great opportunity for shareholders and
    taxpayers to let the organizations we own and support know that wasting money
    on this sort of marketing is silly. Just as an industry-wide gas standard would
    have actually helped Detroit twenty years ago, an industry-wide tax and trade
    salary cap will actually help these organizations. They'll be forced to recruit
    with useful marketing techniques (I'd rather work at an innovative, fast-moving,
    respectful company, given the choice…so the companies would have to make a better
    'product,' not just pay a lot as a result of financial engineering).

  zh: 在我们经济周期的这一时刻，股东和纳税人有一个绝佳的机会，让我们拥有和支持的组织知道，在这种营销上浪费金钱是愚蠢的。就像20年前全行业的燃气标准实际上会帮助底特律一样，一个全行业的税收和贸易薪资上限实际上会帮助这些组织。它们将被迫通过有用的营销技术来招聘（如果有选择的话，我宁愿在一个创新、快速、尊重的公司工作……所以公司必须提供更好的“产品”，而不仅仅是通过财务工程来高薪酬）。

- en: Sometimes markets get stuck because there is a disconnect between what something
    costs and what you get. It costs the individuals on the board of a public company
    nothing to pay more, they get bragging rights and a CEO who is focused on money.
    And that works until the next board leapfrogs them. The boards themselves should
    be lobbying to end this practice, but they won't because… guess what… the folks
    on the boards are the CEOs of other companies. It's stuck.

  zh: 有时候市场会陷入僵局，因为成本与所得之间存在脱节。对于上市公司董事会成员来说，多支付一些成本几乎不会有任何损失，他们可以夸耀自己，并且有一个专注于金钱的CEO。这种做法有效直到下一个董事会跳跃超越他们。董事会本身应该游说终结这种做法，但他们不会，因为……猜猜看……董事会成员中有其他公司的CEO。这是个死结。

    because you don't have the guts to market your jobs properly is silly.
