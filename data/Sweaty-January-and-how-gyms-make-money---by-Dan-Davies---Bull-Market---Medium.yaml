    Secret Life Of Money*](http://www.amazon.com/The-Secret-Life-Money-Explained/dp/1782199950)*”.
    The book deals with all sorts of fascinating facts and business things from our
    careers in banking and consultancy. This chapter deals with the economics of gyms,
    and how the observed charging and usage practices can be explained pretty simply
    by thinking about how they have to cover their costs)*'

- en: If you’re a member of a gym, you will be aware that for the first month of the
    year the place is horribly packed out with sweaty and unfit people, all the classes
    are booked up and you can’t get on any of the machines you want. If your interaction
    with the keep-fit industry is more along the lines of walking past the gym on
    the way to the cake shop, you might be more aware of the equally curious fact
    that commercial gyms always seem to have a heavily advertised ‘special’ membership
    deal going on. Paying the full whack listed rate at a gym is actually a pretty
    difficult thing to do — much more so than paying full freight rack-rate for a
    hotel room — unless you do the single most expensive thing you can do in physical
    culture, and join the gym shortly after the Christmas holidays.

- en: Having seen the books of a gym chain or two, we can tell you that the ‘Sweaty
    January’ phenomenon is not an urban myth or a joke — it’s absolutely fundamental
    to the economics of the industry and it’s basically impossible to run an economically
    viable gym without taking it into account. Usually about 75 per cent of all gym
    memberships are taken out in the month of January. Not only this, but the economics
    of the industry absolutely depend on the fact that a very great proportion of
    January joiners will not visit more than three or four times in total before their
    membership comes to a floundering flop of weight not lost at the end of the year.
    The founder of Colman’s Mustard used to claim that his fortune was based on the
    bit of mustard that everyone left behind on their plate, but gym memberships have
    really pushed things to the limit when it comes to this model of making people
    pay for a lot more of the product than they have any likelihood of using.

  zh: 见过几家健身连锁店的书之后，我们可以告诉你，“出汗一月”现象不是城市传说或笑话——这对行业经济来说绝对是至关重要的，如果不考虑这一点，基本上不可能经营一个经济上可行的健身房。通常情况下，约有
    75% 的健身房会员在一月份加入。不仅如此，而且行业的经济状况绝对依赖于一个非常大的比例，即一月份的新会员在年底之前总共不会多次访问健身房，最多也只会去三次或四次。科尔曼芥末的创始人曾声称，他的财富是建立在每个人都留在餐盘上的一点芥末上的，但健身房会员制真的将这种让人们为更多产品付费的模式推到了极限。
- en: It all starts with the subscription. There are many commercial gyms that won’t
    let you in on a ‘pay-as- you-go’ basis at all, even if you beg. There are plenty
    of others that do, but, unless you are going to a local authority or otherwise
    subsidised facility, as a single- time visitor you are going to be paying the
    equivalent of full January prices and then some. Gym owners do not want anyone
    to be creating the mentality that going to the gym is something that you can pick
    up and put down, and enjoyed only over the beginning of the year in exactly the
    same way as a puppy over the Christmas period. Obviously, a lot of the people
    who run gyms are true believers who really want you to make a proper commitment
    to your own physical health and fitness, but, whether they are or not, they’re
    subject to the same commercial pressure.

  zh: 一切都始于订阅。有很多商业健身房根本不会让你以“随付随用”的方式入场，即使你请求也没用。还有很多其他的健身房会这样做，但是，除非你去一个地方政府或其他受资助的设施，作为一次性访客，你将支付相当于整个一月的费用，甚至更多。健身房老板不希望任何人产生去健身房是一件可以随意放下和享受的心态，就像在圣诞节期间养一只小狗一样，只能在年初过段时间一样。显然，很多经营健身房的人都是真正希望你能对自己的身体健康和健身做出适当承诺的信徒，但是，不管他们是不是，他们都受到同样的商业压力。

- en: 'And that commercial pressure is, basically, rent. A gymnasium is a high-fixed-cost
    business and the driver of those high fixed costs is the fact that a gym customer
    needs quite a bit more space compared to the retail customers in the rest of the
    high street, has significantly more exacting needs on the specification of that
    space and tends to occupy it for longer. Think about it this way: Make a mental
    picture of your local supermarket, or a smallish department store or clothes shop,
    at a reasonably busy period. Now make another mental picture of your local gym
    at an equally busy period and let’s start comparing them. We can note that:'

  zh: 这种商业压力基本上就是租金。健身房是一种高固定成本的业务，驱动这些高固定成本的原因是与其他街道上的零售顾客相比，健身房顾客需要更多的空间，对该空间的规格要求更高，并且倾向于占用更长时间。这样想一想：想象一下你当地的超市，或者一个比较繁忙的小型百货商店或服装店，在一个相当繁忙的时段。现在再想象一下你当地的健身房在同样繁忙的时段，让我们开始比较它们。我们可以注意到：
- en: The retail shop has more people per square foot, doesn’t it, even in a snapshot?
    Most people tend to agree with this when we put it to them — even in the best
    case (for the gym owner) of row upon row of people pounding away on identical
    and compactly placed treadmills or exercise bikes, you just can’t pack them as
    densely as shoppers. Very few retail customers will jig from foot to foot and
    wave their arms about, but people in aerobics classes do.

  zh: 零售店每平方英尺的人数更多，不是吗，即使只是瞬间看一眼？当我们向他们提出这个问题时，大多数人倾向于同意——即使在健身房主人最理想的情况下，有一排排人们在相同的紧凑位置上踩着完全相同的跑步机或健身车，你也无法像购物者那样把他们挤得那么密集。很少有零售顾客会来回晃动双脚并挥舞双臂，但是有氧运动课上的人会这样做。
- en: Now consider that the gym customers, unlike the customers of cafes or supermarkets,
    expect to be able to store their clothes while they’re on the premises and to
    take a shower afterwards. So, for every square foot of space occupied in your
    mental picture of the gym, you need to allocate some changing-room space for every
    customer too. This probably needs to be gender-segregated too (most attempts to
    break this taboo have failed pretty disastrously), further increasing the amount
    of space you need.

  zh: 现在考虑一下，与咖啡馆或超市的顾客不同，健身房的顾客希望在场内存放衣服，并在之后淋浴。所以，在你对健身房的心理想象中，每平方英尺的空间都需要为每位顾客分配一些更衣室空间。这可能还需要按性别分隔（大多数试图打破这一禁忌的尝试都以惨败告终），进一步增加所需的空间量。
- en: Now here comes the real killer — the people in the gym are likely to be staying
    for at least an hour per visit, while the majority of the people in the shop will
    wander in, buy something and leave over a period of no more than twenty minutes.
    The footfall has to be measured on a per hour basis, and, on this basis, gymnasia
    are amazingly inefficient in terms of the usage of space.

  zh: 现在来看看真正的杀手——健身房的人们可能至少会停留一个小时，而商店里的大多数人则会在不超过二十分钟的时间里走进去，买点东西然后离开。必须以每小时的人流量来衡量，从这个角度来看，体育馆在利用空间方面非常低效。

  zh: 当固定成本遇到固定预算
- en: In terms of the fundamental equation of retailing (revenue = footfall x purchases
    per visit x average ticket size), gyms have pretty lousy footfall built into the
    business model, but excellent conversion percentage; more or less by definition,
    everyone occupying the space is paying to do so and thereby making a purchase.
    But they are so inefficient in terms of generating the customer turnover that
    it’s really difficult to make the fixed cost economics work, because the amount
    you’d need to charge per ‘sale’ would end up being beyond the means of most of
    the users. Unless … unless you could push the purchases per visit much higher
    than 100 per cent, by having people paying for the gymnasium services while not
    actually using them. Hence, Sweaty January. Here you have customers paying upfront,
    but turning up only once, twice, perhaps four times in total during the year.
    They then either, realistically, conclude that they have given enough free money
    to the gym, that gym membership is not for them, and don’t renew. Or the gym owner’s
    dream, they repeat to fade every year — joining each January with good intentions,
    and never turning up beyond each mid- March, until expanding waistlines and increasing
    guilt hold sway each coming Christmas time and they renew.

  zh: 就零售的基本方程式而言（收入=客流量 x 每次访问购买量 x 平均票价），健身房在业务模式中已经将客流量考虑得相当糟糕，但在转化率方面表现出色；基本上可以这么定义，每个占用空间的人都是在支付费用，并因此而做出购买。但是，他们在促成客户流失方面非常低效，以至于真的很难使固定成本经济学发挥作用，因为你需要为每个“销售”收取的金额最终会超出大多数用户的承受范围。除非……
    除非你能将每次访问的购买量提高到远高于100％，让人们在不实际使用健身房服务的情况下支付费用。因此，一月出汗月。在这里，你的顾客提前支付，但实际上只出现一次、两次，也许总共四次。然后，他们要么实际上认为他们已经给了健身房足够的免费钱，健身房会员不适合他们，因此不再续费。或者是健身房业主的梦想，他们每年都会重复这个过程——每年一月加入，怀着良好的意图，直到每年三月中旬之后再也不出现，直到腰围不断增大，愧疚感在每年圣诞节前夕占据主导地位，然后他们又重新续费。
- en: The moral of the story is either use it or lose it — the membership that is.
    Or, if you’re planning to have a short burst of good intentions, make sure you
    do it in midsummer when gyms are desperate for new members and will slash prices
    accordingly.
