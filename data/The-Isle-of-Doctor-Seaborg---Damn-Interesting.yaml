    *cyclotron*, received a visit from Emilio Segrè, a scientific colleague from Italy.
    Segrè explained that he had come all the way to America to ask a very small favor:
    He wondered whether Lawrence would part with a few strips of thin metal from an
    old cyclotron unit. Dr. Lawrence was happy to oblige; as far as he was concerned,
    the stuff Segrè sought was mere radioactive trash. He sealed some scraps of the

    model*, which is one of science’s most accurate models of how the stuff of atomic
    nuclei might be organized. The model describes a system where the particles of
    the nucleus organize themselves into structures of progressively larger nested
    “shells”, each made up entirely of protons or neutrons. At atomic scales the *strong
    nuclear force* binds the *nucleon* particles of the nucleus together while the
    *electrostatic force* simultaneously presses them apart.

  zh: 西博格的洞察力基于他对核壳模型的深刻理解，这是科学中最精确的模型之一，描述了原子核内粒子如何组织成逐渐较大的嵌套“壳层”结构，每一层完全由质子或中子组成。在原子尺度上，强核力将核子粒子结合在一起，同时电荷力将它们分开。
- en: The strong force easily dominates petite nuclei such as [3]lithium, keeping
    the nucleons in strict bondage. But in beefier elements on the periodic table
    such as [85]astatine-210 (85 protons and 125 neutrons), the nuclei start to become
    girthy enough that mere attraction is insufficient to bind the bits together indefinitely.
    For these unstable atoms, it is only a matter of time until the struggle between
    attraction and repulsion results in a sudden discharge of nuclear material. This
    radioactive decay releases considerable energy as radiation, and reduces the original
    atom to a lighter element. The assorted ejecta may form into other lighter atoms
    and/or fly off as loose subatomic bits. For instance, when [89]actinium decays
    in nature it can produce the lighter element [87]francium. Francium tends to surrender
    to decay rather rapidly⁠—usually within an hour⁠—to produce atoms of [85]astatine,
    [88]radium, or [86]radon, each of which further decays into other atoms. Francium’s
    abbreviated half-life means that only about 30 grams of of the stuff are present
    in the Earth’s crust at any given time. If one attempted to assemble some francium
    atoms together to observe the properties of this metal, any sample large enough
    to see would instantly vaporize due to the heat of spontaneous fission, and all
    unprotected biological observers would promptly perish.

    to encounter here on Earth is [92]uranium. Essentially all atoms with heavier
    nuclei have fallen apart over the past few billion years. This battle between
    attractive and repelling forces would seem to suggest that the life expectancy
    of an atom is inversely proportional to its obesity. In general, this is roughly
    true. Some heavier nuclei, however, deviate from the pattern and outlast their
    daintier cousins by a considerable margin. The aforementioned nuclear shell model
    ascribes this to the fact that these atomic outliers have a “magic number” of
    particles in their nuclei. When a nucleus has all of its proton shells or neutron
    shells loaded to full capacity, the layers can align so well that each shell can
    spoon intimately with its attractive neighbors, forming a more compact sphere
    that fits well within the strong nuclear force’s area of influence. When *all*
    shells of both nucleon types have a full complement, the layers snuggle spectacularly,
    and the tightly bound result is known as “doubly magic”. One example is [82]lead-208,
    which along with other double-magic atoms will loiter around the universe for
    a very long time indeed.

    become magic or doubly-magic. These never-before-seen elements would possess sturdy,
    comparatively long-lasting nuclei. Presumably, some of these exotic isotopes would
    even be stable. Considering the flighty nature of the heaviest atoms yet wrought

    have not yet encountered any of these stable superheavy atoms in nature. If they
    indeed exist, they ought to be present on Earth in observable quantities like
    all of the other long-lived elements. The answer seems to be that the universe’s
    atom fabricators⁠—stars and supernovae⁠—don’t tend to create the conditions necessary
    to produce superheavy elements. The immense heat and pressure at the center of
    a large star is adept at fusing the universe’s primordial hydrogen, helium, and
    lithium into progressively heavier atoms. But once the star reaches the point
    in its life where it is producing atoms of [28]nickel it begins to spend more
    energy than it gains from each fusion. Some stars can cook up atoms as heavy as
    [83]bismuth before they are completely exhausted. Once it’s bismuth time, the
    star clenches rapidly, producing high-pressure internal shock waves that can spawn
    [92]uranium, [94]plutonium, and [#%$!]pandemonium. The star then explodes, scattering
    its astronomical atomic abundance into the cosmos. The heaviest natural elements
    are now known to be the product of neutron stars⁠—giant stars which have burnt
    out and collapsed into spheres of pure neutrons. When two of these stars collide,
    some of their mass is ejected, and various heavy nuclei can coalesce from this
    soup of naked neutrons.

    with the rest of the matter in the universe amounting to a rounding error. Humans,

    fusion and supernovae are incapable of producing. As of this writing (January
    2013) the heaviest element yet made by man is element 118, known by the temporary

    predictable patterns, producing somewhat predictable chemical reactions. But some

  zh: 到他1999年去世时，Seaborg博士在他的化学生涯中花了30年时间试图穿越已知元素和稳定岛之间的危险通道。在他去世的前一年，1998年，俄罗斯的研究人员成功地合成了[114]镆-289的原子，通过将[94]钚-244与[20]钙-48的离子碰撞。不幸的是，这些合成的原子少了九个中子，无法达到双魔数的[114]镆-298，因此它们迅速衰变了。但Seaborg博士至少活到看到原子探险者们接近这座岛屿上满是贝壳的“海岸”。填入足够的中子仍然是合成稳定超重元素中必须解决的主要问题。
- en: If science ever does succeed in concocting these extraordinary materials, the
    atoms will certainly be expensive to produce in substantial quantities. If the
    new elements exhibit profitable properties, science will likely find a way to
    mass-produce them à la Manhattan Project plutonium. But even if they prove pedestrian,
    these unusual atoms would still represent a scientific first, and their study
    would greatly advance our knowledge of the building blocks of the universe. Indeed,
    perhaps there is a solid [79]gold Nobel or two still on the table. Regardless,
    unless there is some alien civilization more advanced than our own that has beaten
    us to it, humanity may be on the cusp of creating elements unlike anything the
    universe has ever seen.

  zh: 如果科学确实成功地制造这些非凡的材料，这些原子肯定会在大量生产上昂贵。如果新元素展现出有利的特性，科学可能会找到像曼哈顿计划钚那样的方式大规模生产它们。但即使它们被证明是普通的，这些不寻常的原子仍将代表科学的首次，并且它们的研究将极大地推进我们对宇宙构建块的认识。事实上，也许还有一两个固体[79]金的诺贝尔奖仍悬而未决。不管怎样，除非有比我们更先进的外星文明已经赶超我们，否则人类可能正处于创造宇宙从未见过的元素的边缘。
