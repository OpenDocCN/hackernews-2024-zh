  zh: 也许有人认为科技公司害怕误导他们的客户或使他们的核心体验变差，但这是错误的。[亚马逊已经计划将生成式人工智能大量整合到Alexa中](https://www.axios.com/2023/07/26/amazon-alexa-ai-home?ref=wheresyoured.at)，[苹果也计划对Siri进行同样的改进](https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-reportedly-eyeing-generative-ai-push-and-siri-overhaul-for-the-iphone/?ref=wheresyoured.at)，都是为了展示他们在“创新”和“推动边界”方面的能力，却无法解释如何做到。[微软在超级碗上为其“Copilot”
    AI助手做的一分钟广告](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaCVSUbYpVc&ref=wheresyoured.at)展示了人们向它询问“为我的3D开放世界游戏编写代码”和“为我的经典卡车修理车库Mike's设计标志”的场景，后者在商业广告中生成了四幅可用的图像。当我尝试在现实世界中复制这一功能时，Copilot生成了[四幅带有完全难以理解文本的图像](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/ny4fkuvydvcq0bnmfnylm/h?rlkey=0i0dbnlk2k16esn4v3vawy55x&dl=0&ref=wheresyoured.at)，其中只有一幅写着“Mike's”。虽然人们可能会从广告中得出结论，你可以做*些什么*，但这些“些什么”并不是特别明确。

    obsession with artificial intelligence is a symptom of rot, where products are
    created based on analytics and guesswork rather than actually thinking about what
    a customer might want. Artificial intelligence is allegedly going to change our
    lives, but it's difficult to find one compelling description as to how it will
    do so without tumbling into the murky world of tech bro science fiction — and
    even a $7 million Super Bowl commercial from a $3 trillion tech firm couldn't
    seem to find a tangible use case without outright lying about what the result

    rot economy's obsession with symbolic value creation. Tech companies are obsessed
    with juicing metrics to please Wall Street as our phones get flooded with annoying
    notifications and spam calls. The most common ads that I see on Instagram are
    scams where a guy plays a game that doesn't exist so that you'll download one
    of many different awful pay-to-win strategy games, and on Facebook, every third
    post is separated by a carousel of videos that have nothing to do with me, other
    than the fact that Meta wants me to see them. Social networks are no longer for
    networking — they’re content advertising platforms where, if we’re lucky, we might
    just get a chance to see stuff from the people we follow.
