- en: Burkhart had become quadriplegic in a swimming accident after a wave ran him
    into a sandbar and injured his spine. He was later able to receive an implant
    from a research study, which allowed him to temporarily regain some movement in
    one hand. For seven and a half years, he lived with this device—an electrode array
    nestled into his motor cortex that transmitted signals to a computer, which then
    activated electrodes [wrapped around his arm](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/to-your-health/wp/2015/05/22/brain-chip-that-let-man-control-robot-arm-is-just-the-beginning-heres-a-look-at-the-future-of-implantable-chips/).
    Burkhart now heads the BCI Pioneers Coalition, an [organization](https://bcipioneers.org/)
    for the small cohort of other disabled people who have volunteered their brain
    to push the boundaries of brain-computer-interface technology, or BCI.

    Pioneers Coalition，这是一个为其他志愿者将他们的大脑用于推动脑-计算机界面技术或BCI技术边界的少数残疾人的组织。

    the debut of the newest cyborg. [In a video posted on X](https://twitter.com/neuralink/status/1770563939413496146),
    the first human subject for Elon Musk’s BCI company, Neuralink, appeared to control
    a laptop via brain implant. Neuralink has not published its research and did not
    respond to a request for comment, but the device presumably works this way: The
    subject, a paralyzed 29-year-old named Noland Arbaugh, generates a pattern of
    neural activity by thinking about something specific, like moving the cursor on
    his computer screen or moving his hand. The implant then transmits that pattern
    of neural signals to the computer, where an AI algorithm interprets it as a command
    that moves the cursor. Because the implant purportedly allows a user to control
    a computer with their thoughts, more or less, Musk named the device Telepathy.'

    Arbaugh的29岁瘫痪患者，通过思考特定事物（比如移动计算机屏幕上的光标或移动他的手）产生一种神经活动模式。然后，植入物将这种神经信号模式传输到计算机，其中一种AI算法将其解释为移动光标的命令。因为据称该植入物允许用户几乎用思维控制计算机，马斯克将该设备命名为“心灵感应”。

    and frustration at how clearly the demo was created for investors and Musk fans,
    not for disabled people like him. It’s no secret that Musk’s real goal is to create
    a BCI device for general consumers, and not just so we can move a cursor around;
    he envisions a future in which humans can access knowledge directly from computers
    to “[achieve a symbiosis with artificial intelligence](https://www.axios.com/2018/11/26/elon-musk-artificial-intelligence-neuralink).”
    That dream is [ethically fraught](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-02214-2)—privacy,
    for instance, is tricky when your thoughts are augmented by proprietary algorithms—but
    it is also a long way from being realized. Researchers have sort of [managed](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8138057/)

    prototypes by hand and of volunteers who could neither move nor speak struggling
    to control them. The most basic challenge in mating a brain and a computer is
    an incompatibility of materials. Though computers are made of silicon and copper,
    brains are not. They have a consistency not unlike tapioca pudding; they wobble.
    The brain also constantly changes as it learns, and it tends to build scar tissue
    around intrusions. You can’t just stick a wire into it.

- en: Different developers have tried different solutions to this problem. Neuralink
    is working on flexible filaments that thread inconspicuously—they hope—through
    the brain tissue. Precision Neuroscience, founded in part by former Neuralink
    scientists, is trying out a kind of electrode-covered Saran Wrap that clings to
    the surface of the brain or slips into its folds. Then there’s the Utah Array,
    a widely used model that looks a little like a hairbrush with its [bristly pad
    of silicone spikes](https://blackrockneurotech.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Utah-Array-NeuroPort-2.jpg).
    That’s what Burkhart had in his head until 2021, when the study he was part of
    [lost funding](https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/05/26/1073655/how-it-feels-to-have-a-life-changing-brain-implant-removed/)

    Wrap，它可以贴在大脑表面或滑入褶皱中。然后是犹他阵列，这是一种广泛使用的模型，看起来有点像带有[硅鞭毛垫](https://blackrockneurotech.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Utah-Array-NeuroPort-2.jpg)的发刷。这就是Burkhart在2021年之前脑中所植入的，直到他所参与的研究[失去了资金支持](https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/05/26/1073655/how-it-feels-to-have-a-life-changing-brain-implant-removed/)，他决定将植入物取出。他担心外科医生可能不得不“连同一些大脑组织一起取出”。幸运的是，他告诉我，它“并没有太多抵抗”。
- en: Once an implant is in place, the tiny signals of individual neurons—measurable
    in microvolts—have to be amplified, digitized, and transmitted, preferably by
    a unit that’s both wireless and inconspicuous. That’s problem number two. Problem
    three is decoding those signals. We have no real idea of how the brain talks to
    itself, so a machine-learning algorithm has to use a brute-force approach, finding
    patterns in neural activity and learning to correlate them with whatever the person
    with the implant is trying to make the computer do.

- en: None of these problems is trivial, but they’ve been substantially tackled over
    the past 30 years of BCI research. At least six different companies are now testing
    applications such as desktop interfaces (like the one that helped Arbaugh play
    chess), drivers for [robotic limbs](https://www.wired.com/story/this-brain-controlled-robotic-arm-can-twist-grasp-and-feel/)

    engineering and might be harder to solve than all the others. This problem is
    what Ben Rapoport, the chief science officer at Precision, described to me as
    “the productization of science.” It’s where engineering successes run into political
    and economic obstacles. To roll out even a basic point-and-click medical BCI interface,
    developers would have to win approval not just from the FDA but also from “payers”:
    Medicare, Medicaid, and private insurance companies. This is make-or-break: Medical
    devices, even ingenious ones, won’t get to consumers if insurance won’t cover

    devices, pacemakers—and it’s not unlikely that BCI implants could join that list

    might argue that BCI devices aren’t strictly medically necessary—they’re “life-enhancing,”
    not “life-sustaining,” as Burkhart put it—but on the other hand, insurers are
    likely to see them as cost-efficient if their implementation can save money on

- en: Even so, there’s a limit to what brain implants can do and what they can replace.
    The people who would benefit most from BCI devices, people with major motor impairments
    like Arbaugh and Burkhart, would still depend on human labor for many things,
    such as getting in and out of bed, bathing, dressing, and eating. That labor can
    easily cost as much as six figures a year and isn’t typically reimbursed by private
    health-insurance companies. For most people, the only insurer that covers this
    kind of care is [Medicaid](https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/IF/IF10343),
    which in most states comes with stringent restrictions on recipients’ [income](https://www.kff.org/affordable-care-act/state-indicator/medicaid-income-eligibility-limits-for-adults-as-a-percent-of-the-federal-poverty-level/)

    这种劳动的成本很容易高达六位数，并且通常不会由私人健康保险公司报销。 对于大多数人来说，唯一覆盖此类护理的保险公司是[Medicaid](https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/IF/IF10343)，在大多数州都对受益人的[收入](https://www.kff.org/affordable-care-act/state-indicator/medicaid-income-eligibility-limits-for-adults-as-a-percent-of-the-federal-poverty-level/)和[资产](https://choicemutual.com/blog/medicaid-asset-limits-by-state/)设有严格的限制。

    raises the monthly income cap for some to $2,829.) The salary they’d have to make
    to cover both expenses and in-home care out of pocket, though, is much more than
