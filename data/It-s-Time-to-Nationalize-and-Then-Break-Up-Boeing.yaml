    prompting mass groundings of Boeing planes, it helps to start with the fact that
    Boeing is not a private corporation, but is a state entity in all but name. And
    that’s in part because the firm has immense market power. "Obviously it's a human
    tragedy,” said one guest on CNBC this week, “but from a financial impact, I like

    a financial crisis. For instance, just as the Covid crisis hit, it wasn’t merely
    banks and airlines that sought a backstop; Boeing sought tens of billions in government
    money to keep the aerospace industry afloat.

    American society simply doesn’t function without aerospace capacity, and hasn’t

    executives have more power over government than the other way around, but that’s
