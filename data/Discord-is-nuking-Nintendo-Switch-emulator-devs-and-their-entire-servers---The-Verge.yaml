    [Suyu](https://suyu.dev/) and [Sudachi](https://github.com/sudachi-emu/sudachi)
    and has completely disabled their lead developers’ accounts — and the company
    isn’t answering our questions about why it went that far. Both Suyu and Sudachi
    began as forks of [Yuzu, the emulator that Nintendo sued out of existence](/24098640/nintendo-emulator-yuzu-lawsuit-switch-aftermath)

    Discord 没有回答关于这些用户是否是重复侵权者、是否收到过任何先前警告或是否转发过任何下架请求的问题。

    email was that my account has broken the TOS, with no additional information.”

    is written to reflect that. A valid takedown request has to include a description
    of the content that’s infringing and where to find it; a platform then takes down
    the content, and users can get it reinstated if they file a “counter-notice” that
    claims it wasn’t actually infringing. At that point, Discord has done its job,
    and Nintendo can sue the developer directly if it wants by using the counter-notice
    to track them down.

    已经完成了其工作，如果任天堂想起诉开发者，可以使用反通知追踪他们。

    advertising, promoting....or otherwise trafficking in Yuzu or any source code
    or features of Yuzu,” it’s specifically talking about third parties “acting in

    Discord 确实看到了这些 Discord 中的软件盗版证据。但目前它并没有以此来为这些频道清除行为辩护。
