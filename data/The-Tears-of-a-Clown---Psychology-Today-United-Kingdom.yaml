    their interest in music. Compared to the actors, the professional comedians had

    likely than the actors to describe the father in highly positive terms, and were
    more inclined to refer to the mother as a disciplinarian, an aggressive critic,
    non-nurturing, and non-maternal. This finding was also discovered in a sample

    The authors interpret these findings as suggesting that humor represents an attempt

    distancing is precisely what enables these individuals to be funny, since it allows

    needs to be more research on female comics!) who are raised by a non-nurturing

- en: The Fishers related this open style personality to the comics in their sample

    early adventures with their mother. Their idea is that he or she becomes an expert
    in "reading" his or her mother, and then later learns how to "scan the world in

    absurdity of their own position. They note that much of humor involves spotting
    and giving meaning to ambiguities, and that comedians are obsessed with instability.

    in their early childhood.

- en: Fisher and Fisher also found that the majority of professional comedians in

    as a child and that much comic behavior is aimed at reducing the discrepancy of
    smallness between themselves and others. "There is no question but that size strategies
    pervade the comic's codes and metaphors...He is forever reducing or magnifying.
    He never reports things in their immediate proportions" (p. 216). They also note
    that the low [self-esteem](https://www.psychologytoday.com/gb/basics/self-esteem
    "Psychology Today looks at self-esteem") and feeling of smallness existent among
    the professional comics may actually set the comic on a unique path. "We would

    Today looks at altruistic"). The comic sees his or her central duty as that of
    making people feel that events are funny. At the same time, the professional comics
    also viewed humor as a technique for controlling and dominating the audience.
    Indeed, Fisher and Fisher were impressed at how this view of the comic as a fool-priest
    is consistent with scholarly reviews of the history of the clown, the court jester,
    and the fool. They also noted how the contemporary comic serves a similar function
    as the court jester in earlier times. On the one hand, the comic presents himself
    or herself as the silly fellow that jokes, amuses and entertains. On the other
    hand, the comic initiates opposing currents, uncovering truths that many people

- en: This research suggests that humor in professional comedians serves as a defense
    or coping mechanisms in dealing with his or her early family experiences, and
    the burden of having to take care of oneself. This may motivate the comic to make
    people laugh in order to gain their acceptance, as well as drive the comic to
    reveal the absurdity of life to make sense of their own lives. As Mark Runco has
    noted, writing is often a form of problem-solving; many writers are motivated
    to write to solve problems in their lives. Comedy writers may use comedy in their
    writing to help them understand themselves and the world, and to do so in a fashion
    that controls the reader's emotions. Enough analysis. Whatever the reason for
    comics, thank goodness for them.
