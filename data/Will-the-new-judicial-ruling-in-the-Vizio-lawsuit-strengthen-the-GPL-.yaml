  zh: 法律背景
- en: 'Traditionally, open source licenses have been enforced through the law of copyright.
    In other words, the key question has been did copying occur, and if so, were the
    rights of the author violated? This has a subtle, but very important effect: only
    the author can initiate the lawsuit. In addition in the United States, such lawsuits
    must be filed in federal court, rather than in state courts, and the remedies
    available are primarily financial.'
  id: totrans-8
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 传统上，开源许可证一直通过版权法来执行。换句话说，关键问题是是否发生了复制，如果是，作者的权利是否受到了侵犯？这有一个微妙但非常重要的影响：只有作者才能提起诉讼。此外，在美国，这类诉讼必须在联邦法院而不是州法院提起，并且可用的救济措施主要是金融方面的。
- en: However, arguably, open source licenses could also be enforced through the law
    of contracts. Contracts can be about copyright, but in general they are a different
    beast. In the United States, remedies for contracts can include what is called
    "specific performance”—in other words, a judge can order someone who has broken
    a contract to do a specific act. Contracts also are typically enforced through
    state courts, not federal courts.
  id: totrans-9
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 然而，可以说，开源许可证也可以通过合同法来执行。合同可以涉及版权，但总的来说它们是两码事。在美国，合同的救济措施可能包括所谓的“具体履行”——换句话说，法官可以命令违约者执行特定的行为。合同通常也是通过州法院而不是联邦法院来执行的。
- en: Finally, and most importantly for our discussion today, contracts can—under
    certain conditions—be enforced by third parties. These parties are known as third-party
    beneficiaries. Because they benefit from the contract, they can sometimes enforce
    the contract. For example, if I signed a contract with a baker to deliver a cake
    to my mother, my mother would be able to sue the baker if the cake did not arrive.

  zh: 最后，也是我们今天讨论的最重要的一点是，根据一定条件，合同可以由第三方强制执行。这些第三方被称为第三方受益人。因为他们受益于合同，所以有时他们可以执行合同。例如，如果我与一个面包师签订合同让他送一个蛋糕给我妈妈，如果蛋糕没有送到，我妈妈就能起诉面包师。

  zh: Vizio案件
- en: In October of 2021 the Software Freedom Conservancy (SFC) decided to launch
    what is believed to be the first significant open source lawsuit based in contract
    rather than in copyright. Critically, the SFC’s case argued that anyone who benefits
    from the General Public License (GPL), not just the authors of the software, should
    be able to bring a lawsuit to enforce the terms of the GPL.

  zh: 2021年10月，软件自由保护协会（SFC）决定发起据信是第一起重大的以合同而不是版权为基础的开源诉讼。关键是，SFC的案件认为任何从GNU通用公共许可证（GPL）中受益的人，而不仅仅是软件的作者，都应该能够提起诉讼来执行GPL的条款。
- en: This case was brought in Orange County, California against Vizio, a large TV
    manufacturer. Like most TVs these days, Vizio TVs include Linux and a lot of other
    open source software that is under the GPL. The GPL says that buyers of those
    TVs should be able to get copies of that source code, so SFC walked into a store
    in Orange County, bought a TV, and requested copies of the source code. Vizio
    did not comply with the request, and so SFC brought suit.

  zh: 这个案件是在加利福尼亚州橙县针对Vizio，一家大型电视制造商提起的。像现在的大多数电视一样，Vizio电视包括Linux和许多其他GPL下的开源软件。GPL规定购买这些电视的人应该能够获取那些源代码的副本，因此SFC走进橙县的一家商店购买了一台电视，并要求获取源代码的副本。Vizio没有遵守该请求，因此SFC提起了诉讼。
- en: To win their case, SFC knew that they would have to jump through several hoops.
    The most obvious one was the imbalance in resources—Vizio’s law firm makes about
    as much in a day as SFC makes from donations in a year. (You can [buy a t-shirt](https://sfconservancy.org/sustainer/)
    if you want to help.) But there are a lot of legal barriers too.

  zh: 为了赢得他们的案件，SFC知道他们必须跳过几个障碍。最明显的一个是资源不平衡—Vizio的律师事务所一天的收入大约与SFC从捐赠中获得的收入相当于一年。
    （如果你想帮忙，你可以[购买一件 T 恤](https://sfconservancy.org/sustainer/)。）但也有很多法律障碍。
- en: Under U.S. law, the first hoop was that they had to prove that the case was
    not a copyright case. This is because, under a doctrine known as preemption, state
    courts generally cannot rule on questions of federal law, like copyright. They
    won that in [May of 2022](https://sfconservancy.org/news/2022/may/16/vizio-remand-win/),
    and then the case turned to the next question.

  zh: 根据美国法律，第一个障碍是他们必须证明这不是一起版权案件。这是因为根据一个被称为优先权的原则，州法院通常不能就版权等联邦法律问题做出裁决。他们在[2022年5月](https://sfconservancy.org/news/2022/may/16/vizio-remand-win/)赢得了这一点，然后案件转向了下一个问题。
- en: (I realize it sounds odd to say that a case about software licenses is not a
    copyright case. The legal issue there is shockingly complex, so I won’t go into
    it much here. The short version is that, by asking for specific performance (a
    contract remedy) rather than financial penalties (a copyright remedy), and by
    claiming violations of rights granted by the contract (the license) rather than
    rights granted by copyright, the federal court found that this was a contract
    case and not a copyright case.)

  zh: （我意识到说一个关于软件许可证的案件不是版权案件听起来很奇怪。那里的法律问题令人震惊地复杂，所以我在这里不会详细介绍。简短版本是，通过要求具体执行（一种合同救济）而不是要求罚款（版权救济），以及声称侵犯了合同（许可证）授予的权利而不是版权授予的权利，联邦法院认为这是一起合同案件而不是版权案件。）

- en: 'Last week’s ruling was primarily about the next important question in the case,
    what’s known as “standing.” Courts, for fairly obvious reasons, don''t like to
    have random people in the courtroom. So they have developed the question of standing:
    do you have the right to even launch the lawsuit at all? In contracts, the question
    of standing is usually easy: are you one of the parties named in the contract
    or not?'
  id: totrans-18
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 上周的裁决主要是关于案件中下一个重要问题的，即所谓的“诉讼地位”。法院，出于相当明显的原因，不喜欢随机的人在法庭上出现。因此，他们提出了诉讼地位的问题：你是否有权发起诉讼？在合同中，诉讼地位的问题通常很容易：你是否是合同中命名的一方？
- en: 'Third-party beneficiaries add a small wrinkle to this: if a third-party is
    named in the contract, and the parties who signed the contract intended for that
    third-party to benefit from the contract, then the third party might have standing.'

  zh: 第三方受益人为此增加了一点复杂性：如果合同中指定了第三方，并且签署合同的各方打算使第三方受益于该合同，则该第三方可能具有诉讼地位。
- en: Here, Vizio attempted to argue that the state court should end the case because
    SFC was not a third-party beneficiary, and so had no standing. This question is,
    for open source license enforcement, a truly revolutionary one. Depending on how
    the court answered, the tradition that only software authors could enforce open
    source licenses would be maintained, or the dam would break open—and anyone who
    buys hardware with the Linux kernel in it would have the right to sue.
  id: totrans-20
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 在这里，Vizio试图辩称州法院应该结束此案，因为SFC不是第三方受益人，因此没有诉讼地位。对于开源许可证的执行而言，这个问题是一个真正革命性的问题。根据法院的回答方式，只有软件作者才能执行开源许可证的传统可能会被保持，或者大坝会破裂——购买带有Linux内核的硬件的任何人都有权起诉。
- en: It is important to note that at this stage, Vizio was (in essence) arguing that
    SFC’s case had “no merit” and so no reasonable person could find SFC to be a third-party
    beneficiary. If the court agreed, the case would then end. But if the court found
    reasonable people could disagree then the case would proceed.
  id: totrans-21

  zh: 需要注意的是，在这个阶段，Vizio（实质上）辩称SFC的案件“没有价值”，因此任何理性人都不会认为SFC是第三方受益人。如果法院同意，那么案件将会终结。但如果法院认为合理的人们可能会持不同意见，那么案件就会继续进行。

  zh: 法院的裁决
- en: For such a potentially revolutionary holding, the court’s argument is quite
    short and to the point. First, the court rehashed the question of whether this
    is a contract claim or a copyright claim. Ultimately, it agreed with the federal
    court last May that despite being about a copyrighted work, the claims made fall
    into the category of contract rather than the rights and remedies of the Copyright
    Act.
  id: totrans-23
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 对于这样一个可能具有革命性的裁决，法庭的论点非常简短并直截了当。首先，法庭重申了这是否是合同索赔还是版权索赔的问题。最终，它同意了去年五月联邦法院的意见，尽管涉及版权作品，但所提出的索赔属于合同范畴，而不是版权法案的权利和补救措施。
- en: 'That left the question of standing—since the California court is going to treat
    this like a contract, is SFC a third-party beneficiary who can bring a claim?
    Quoting an earlier California case, the court said that the third party must show
    three things:'

  zh: 这就留下了地位的问题 —— 由于加利福尼亚法院将把这件事视为一份合同，SFC是否是可以提起诉讼的第三方受益人？法庭引用早期加利福尼亚案件说，第三方必须展示三个方面：

    of the contracting parties. Relying on the Free Software Foundation’s (FSF) GPL
    FAQs, it argued that the FSF never intended for third parties to enforce the contract,
    and therefore the parties to the contract could not have intended it. The court
    was harsh here:'

  zh: Vizio“没有反驳”前两个问题，而是关注于合同各方的“期望”。依据自由软件基金会（FSF）的GPL常见问题解答，它认为FSF从未打算让第三方执行合同，因此合同各方也不可能有此意图。法庭在这里非常严厉：
- en: “much of Defendant Vizio’s argument is based on inadmissible evidence, and there
    is no competent evidence that suggests that the intent of FSF was to preclude
    recipients of the source code as beneficiaries to the GPLs.”

  prefs: []

  zh: 法庭毫不含糊：
- en: “Allowing third parties such as SFC to enforce their rights to receive source
    code is not only consistent with the GPLs’ objectives; it is both essential and
    necessary to achieve these objectives. Recipients of GPL-licensed software will
    be assured of their right to receive source code only if they have standing to
    enforce that right.”

  zh: “允许像SFC这样的第三方执行他们获得源代码的权利，不仅符合GPL的目标；而且对于实现这些目标至关重要和必要。只有当GPL许可的软件的接收者有资格执行该权利时，他们才能确保获得源代码的权利。”
- en: At this stage of a case, judges are generally inclined to insert phrases like
    “giving the benefit of the doubt.” Because they are talking about what reasonable
    people might believe, they also often say “may” and “might.” In that context,
    the statement that third party enforcement is “essential and necessary” jumps
    off the page.
  id: totrans-37
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 在案件的这个阶段，法官通常倾向于插入诸如“给予怀疑的好处”这样的短语。因为他们在讨论合理人可能相信的事情，他们也经常说“可能”和“可能会”。在这种背景下，第三方执行“至关重要和必要”这一声明格外引人注目。
- en: The judge follows this up with an economic analysis based on California case
    law. Again, they find this supports SFC, saying that if only copyright holders
    could enforce, they “would have no economic incentive to enforce ... because they
    would bear all the enforcement costs with no real benefit themselves.” This is
    again quite strikingly strong language—no “arguably” or “maybe” to be found.

  zh: 法官在此基础上进行了基于加利福尼亚州案例法的经济分析。同样，他们发现这支持SFC，认为如果只有版权持有者才能执行，他们“将没有经济动力来执行……因为他们将承担所有的执行成本，而没有真正的好处。”这又是非常强硬的措辞，没有找到“可能”的或“也许”的。
- en: The court ultimately concludes that the question of whether SFC is a third-party
    beneficiary is a “triable issue of material fact,” which is lawyer-speak for “reasonable
    people might disagree about what happened, so we should go to trial to figure
    it out.”

  zh: 接下来是什么？
- en: The judge’s simple and straightforward ruling suggests that changing the judge’s
    mind on this point will be an uphill battle for Vizio. In this light, the judge’s
    note about how much of the evidence was “inadmissible” and not “competent” is
    particularly harsh. The evidence in this brief was presumably the best written
    evidence that extremely good lawyers could find, so Vizio will have to try other
    routes to show the judge what the “reasonable expectations” of the “parties” were.
    Since Vizio presumably relied on the best public documents they could find, it
    wouldn’t surprise me if they ask Linus to talk about his expectations when he
    put the kernel under the GPL.
  id: totrans-41
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 法官简单明了的裁决表明，在这一点上改变法官的想法对Vizio来说将是一场艰苦的战斗。从这个角度看，法官关于多少证据是“不可接受的”而不是“有资格的”这一点尤其严厉。本次简报中的证据可能是极好的律师能找到的最好的书面证据，因此Vizio将不得不尝试其他途径向法官展示“各方”的“合理期望”是什么。由于Vizio可能依赖于他们能找到的最好的公共文件，如果他们要求Linus谈谈他将内核置于GPL下时的期望，我不会感到惊讶。
- en: Before we get there, though, SFC has asked the court to rule on whether the
    contract (the GPL) creates a “legal duty” for Vizio to “share source code with
    SFC as provided by the GPLs.” In essence, SFC is saying that (given the text of
    the GPL) the court already has all it needs to know about the nature of the duty,
    and so if there is a trial, it should be merely about the scope of the duty, not
    its existence. Here, the benefit of the doubt will go the other way, with Vizio
    only needing to prove that there are questions about that duty best settled in
    a full trial. I suspect the court will find that there is a duty to provide source
    code, but allow the trial to settle the important question of how much source
    code.

  zh: 在我们到达那之前，SFC已要求法院判决合同（GPL）是否为Vizio创建了“法律义务”，即“根据GPLs与SFC共享源代码”。本质上，SFC认为（鉴于GPL的文本），法院已经知道了义务的性质，因此如果进行审判，它应该仅仅是关于义务范围，而不是存在性。在这里，对Vizio的怀疑将被推翻，只需要证明有关该义务最好在全面审判中解决的问题。我怀疑法院将会发现有提供源代码的义务，但允许审判来解决源代码的数量问题。

    just went way up. The limitations on financial claims will (probably) not make
    this a lucrative line of mass litigation, but a threat letter from the SFC or
    similar groups will carry much more weight. One could easily imagine other activist
    groups using similar arguments to free source code to systems they oppose, like
    surveillance systems or [locked up trains](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/12/manufacturer-deliberately-bricked-trains-repaired-by-competitors-hackers-find/).
    I’ll continue to watch this case closely, but for now we should see this recent
