    the mental attitude toward market fluctuations that I believe to be most conducive
    to investment success. He said that you should imagine market quotations as coming
    from a remarkably accommodating fellow named Mr. Market who is your partner in
    a private business. Without fail, Mr. Market appears daily and names a price at
    which he will either buy your interest or sell you his.

  zh: 我的朋友和导师本·格雷厄姆[早年描述](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0060555661/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=farnamstreet-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=0060555661&linkId=6c5ba2ad371f4559568e2fc7f5aae154)了一种对待市场波动的心态，我相信这是最有助于投资成功的。他说，你应该把市场行情想象成一个极其随和的家伙，名叫Mr.
    Market，他是你私人生意中的合作伙伴。每天，Mr. Market都会出现，并报出一个价格，要么买入你的利益，要么卖出他的利益。
- en: Even though the business that the two of you own may have economic characteristics
    that are stable, Mr. Market’s quotations will be anything but. For, sad to say,
    the poor fellow has incurable emotional problems. At times he feels euphoric and
    can see only the favorable factors affecting the business. When in that mood,
    he names a very high buy-sell price because he fears that you will snap up his
    interest and rob him of imminent gains. At other times he is depressed and can
    see nothing but trouble ahead for both the business and the world. On these occasions,
    he will name a very low price, since he is terrified that you will unload your
    interest on him.

  zh: 即使你们共同拥有的业务可能具有稳定的经济特征，Mr. Market的报价却绝非如此。不幸的是，这位可怜的家伙有不可治愈的情感问题。有时他感到欣喜若狂，只能看到影响业务的有利因素。在这种心境下，他会给出非常高的买卖价格，因为他担心你会抢走他的利益，使他失去即将到来的收益。而在其他时候，他感到沮丧，只能看到业务和世界前方的麻烦。在这些时候，他会报出非常低的价格，因为他害怕你会将你的利益卖给他。
- en: 'Mr. Market has another endearing characteristic: He doesn’t mind being ignored.
    If his quotation is uninteresting to you today, he will be back with a new one
    tomorrow. Transactions are strictly at your option. Under these conditions, the
    more manic-depressive his behavior, the better for you.'

  zh: Mr. Market还有另一个讨人喜欢的特点：他并不介意被忽视。如果他的报价今天对你没什么吸引力，他明天会带来一个新的。交易完全由你决定。在这些条件下，他的行为越是躁郁，对你越有利。
- en: 'But, like Cinderella at the ball, you must heed one warning or everything will
    turn into pumpkins and mice: Mr. Market is there to serve you, not to guide you.
    It is his pocketbook, not his wisdom, that you will find useful. If he shows up
    some day in a particularly foolish mood, you are free to either ignore him or
    to take advantage of him, but it will be disastrous if you fall under his influence.
    Indeed, if you aren’t certain that you understand and can value your business
    far better than Mr. Market, you don’t belong in the game. As they say in poker,
    “If you’ve been in the game 30 minutes and you don’t know who the patsy is, you’re
    the patsy.”'

  zh: 但是，就像灰姑娘在舞会上一样，你必须注意一点警告，否则一切都会变成南瓜和老鼠：Mr. Market在这里是为了服务你，而不是引导你。对于你来说，有用的是他的钱包，而不是他的智慧。如果有一天他表现得特别愚蠢，你可以选择忽略他或者利用他，但是如果你被他的影响所左右，那将是灾难性的。确实，如果你不能确定自己比Mr.
    Market更好地理解和评估你的业务，那你就不适合这场游戏。就像在扑克中所说的，“如果你玩了30分钟而你不知道谁是幌子，那么你就是幌子。”
- en: Ben’s Mr. Market allegory may seem out-of-date in today’s investment world,
    in which most professionals and academicians talk of efficient markets, dynamic
    hedging and betas. Their interest in such matters is understandable, since techniques
    shrouded in mystery clearly have value to the purveyor of investment advice. After
    all, what witch doctor has ever achieved fame and fortune by simply advising “Take
    two aspirins”?

  zh: 在今天的投资世界中，本的“市场先生”寓言可能看起来过时了，大多数专业人士和学者们谈论的是有效市场、动态对冲和贝塔。他们对这些问题的兴趣是可以理解的，因为神秘的技术显然对投资建议的提供者有价值。毕竟，什么巫医曾凭简单建议“服用两颗阿司匹林”而获得名声和财富呢？
- en: The value of market esoterica to the consumer of investment advice is a different
    story. In my opinion, investment success will not be produced by arcane formulae,
    computer programs or signals flashed by the price behavior of stocks and markets.
    Rather an investor will succeed by coupling good business judgment with an ability
    to insulate his thoughts and behavior from the super-contagious emotions that
    swirl about the marketplace. In my own efforts to stay insulated, I have found
    it highly useful to keep Ben’s Mr. Market concept firmly in mind.

  zh: 市场奥秘对投资建议的消费者的价值是另一回事。我认为，投资成功不会由神秘的公式、计算机程序或股票和市场价格行为所发出的信号产生。相反，投资者将通过良好的商业判断力以及能够使其思维和行为免受市场上下波动的超级传染性情绪影响而取得成功。在努力保持独立思考的过程中，我发现将本的市场先生概念牢记心中非常有用。
- en: 'Following Ben’s teachings, Charlie and I let our marketable equities tell us
    by their operating results – not by their daily, or even yearly, price quotations
    – whether our investments are successful. The market may ignore business success
    for a while, but eventually will confirm it. As Ben said: “**In the short run,
    the market is a voting machine but in the long run it is a weighing machine**.”
    The speed at which a business’s success is recognized, furthermore, is not that
    important as long as the company’s intrinsic value is increasing at a satisfactory
    rate. In fact, delayed recognition can be an advantage: It may give us the chance
    to buy more of a good thing at a bargain price.'

  zh: 在本的教导下，查理和我通过其运营结果而不是每日或甚至每年的报价来判断我们的市场资产是否成功。市场可能会暂时忽视业务成功，但最终将予以确认。正如本所说：“**短期内，市场是一个投票机，但长期来看，它是一个称重机**。”此外，企业成功被认可的速度并不那么重要，只要公司的内在价值以令人满意的速度增长即可。事实上，延迟的认可可能是一个优势：它可能使我们有机会以低廉的价格购买更多优质资产。
