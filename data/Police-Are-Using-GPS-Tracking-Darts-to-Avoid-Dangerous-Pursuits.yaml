- en: One of the most common spy movie tropes is the protagonist's ability to tag
    a suspect with a discreet tracking dart from afar. That way, they can covertly
    track the baddies wherever they go. Well, it's no longer a spy movie trick—it's
    reality, as police departments have begun tagging [fleeing vehicles](https://www.thedrive.com/news/this-high-speed-chase-of-a-u-haul-gmc-savana-is-pure-chaos)
    with GPS trackers, eliminating the need for high-speed pursuit.

  zh: 间谍电影中最常见的情节之一是主角能够从远处偷偷地用跟踪飞镖标记嫌疑人。这样，他们可以秘密地追踪坏人的行踪。现在，这不再是间谍电影的把戏，而是现实，因为警察部门已经开始用GPS追踪器标记[逃逸车辆](https://www.thedrive.com/news/this-high-speed-chase-of-a-u-haul-gmc-savana-is-pure-chaos)，从而消除了高速追逐的需要。
- en: Old Westbury Police Department in New York is using vehicle-mounted launchers
    that fire foam projectiles with a heat-activated sticky glue at fleeing vehicles
    in a car chase. The projectiles have wireless GPS tracking systems built into
    them, which allow police to track the car's whereabouts. The launchers and darts
    are made by [StarChase](https://www.starchase.com/products/vehicle-mounted-gps-launcher/),
    who also leases out handheld units to the NYPD, among other departments. The idea
    is to eliminate car chases, which are dangerous and often put the public at risk.

  zh: 纽约Old Westbury警察局正在使用车载发射器，这些发射器发射带有热激活粘胶的泡沫弹丸，用于追击车辆逃逸。这些弹丸内置无线GPS追踪系统，允许警方跟踪汽车的位置。这些发射器和飞镖由[StarChase](https://www.starchase.com/products/vehicle-mounted-gps-launcher/)制造，他们还向纽约市警察局等部门租赁手持装置。这一理念的目标是消除危险且经常将公众置于危险中的车辆追逐行动。
- en: “Police pursuits are very much discouraged,” said Old Westbury Police Chief
    Stuart Cameron, according to [*Gothamist*](https://gothamist.com/news/traffic-jams-airtags-and-gps-darts-are-all-ways-ny-nj-police-are-trying-to-stop-car-theft).
    “The statistics just speak for themselves ... suspects are getting hurt, officers
    are getting hurt, and even members of the public are getting killed and injured
    in these pursuits.”

- en: The launchers mount to the front of police cars, so cops only have to chase
    a fleeing vehicle for long enough to tag it with a sticky dart, and then they
    can back off and track its location. Compressed air fires the darts, and they're
    said to travel at about 30 mph and stick without leaving any damage.

  zh: 这些发射器安装在警车前部，因此警察只需追击逃逸车辆足够长的时间以标记它，然后就可以后退并跟踪其位置。压缩空气发射这些飞镖，据说它们以约30英里/小时的速度飞行，并且粘附在上面而不留下任何损害。
- en: It isn't only on Long Island where these tracking darts are used, though. Police
    departments in Michigan, Tennessee, Texas, Washington State, and more have begun
    fitting them. However, the usage of these trackers on civilian vehicles raises
    questions about their constitutionality, as some have argued that they violate
    Fourth Amendment rights. In a 2012 Supreme Court case, *U.S. vs Jones*, it was
    unanimously ruled that GPS tracking a car without a warrant constitutes an illegal
    search, breaching the Fourth Amendment. However, the American Civil Liberties
    Union (ACLU) has stated that there isn't an issue with GPS tracking darts, "assuming
    that [they're] used in the kind of way that everybody probably imagines," in the
    words of [Jay Stanley, ACLU senior policy analyst](https://www.aclu.org/news/national-security/gps-bullets-allow-police-shoot-tracker-car).
    Put another way, if the dart's fired during a car chase with a fleeing vehicle,
    its use is likely legal so long as the tracker is then removed after the vehicle's
    been caught.

  zh: 不仅在长岛，这些追踪飞镖也在其他地方使用。密歇根、田纳西、德克萨斯、华盛顿州的警察部门都已经开始使用它们。然而，这些追踪器在民用车辆上的使用引发了对它们是否符合宪法的质疑，一些人认为它们违反了第四修正案的权利。在2012年的最高法院案件*美国诉琼斯案*中，一致裁定未经授权对汽车进行GPS追踪构成非法搜查，违反第四修正案。然而，美国公民自由联盟（ACLU）表示，关于GPS追踪飞镖并不存在问题，"假设它们被用在大家可能想象的方式"，用ACLU高级政策分析师[杰伊·斯坦利](https://www.aclu.org/news/national-security/gps-bullets-allow-police-shoot-tracker-car)的话来说。换句话说，如果在与逃逸车辆进行追逐时发射飞镖，只要追踪器在捕捉到车辆后立即移除，其使用很可能是合法的。
- en: GPS tracking darts aren't all that new, but they're becoming more widespread
    among law enforcement. On one hand, it strikes a little dystopian that police
    are getting in the habit of tracking vehicles this way, but on the other, when
    used properly, they have the potential to spare everyone a dangerous crash.
