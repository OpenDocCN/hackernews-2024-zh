- en: As the YC example shows, Techstars had the opportunity to build one of the world’s
    top investing platforms for technical founders in every major tech hub outside
    the Bay Area. But in their rush to occupy that “everywhere else” market, Techstars
    cut strategic corners to generate near-term cash flow, creating a path-dependent
    trajectory to their current outcome. By making corporate funders, and not startup
    founders, their primary customer, Techstars built a centrally-controlled sales-
    and operations-driven culture that made startups the product, not the customer.
    As soon as the top tier of startup founders figured out that YC had their interests
    at heart in the way that Techstars once had, but no longer did, the game was over.

  zh: 正如YC的例子所示，Techstars有机会在湾区之外的每个主要技术创业中心建立世界顶级的技术创始人投资平台。但在他们急于占据“其他地方”市场的过程中，Techstars为了产生近期的现金流而削减了战略上的角落，创造了通向他们当前结果的路径依赖轨迹。通过将企业资助者而不是初创公司创始人作为主要客户，Techstars建立了一个以销售和运营驱动的文化为核心的中央控制型结构，使得初创公司成为产品而非客户。一旦顶级初创公司创始人发现YC像Techstars曾经那样关心他们的利益，但现在已不再关心，游戏就结束了。
- en: 'It’s hard to prove a counterfactual, but imagine that Techstars had stuck with
    its original model: a loose but values-aligned federation of career startup investors,
    each responsible for building the highest-performing investor and mentor community
    in their respective markets, but sharing information, best practices and back-office
    infrastructure. As it was in the beginning, 90% of the economics were sourced
    from, and returned to the local markets, but Techstars accumulated its 10% profit-sharing
    strip from each market, plus an overhead charge that allowed them to invest not
    in ever-growing sales and operations teams, but rather in high-quality software
    tooling and infrastructure that served the entire network.'

  zh: 证明一种反事实的难度很大，但想象一下，如果Techstars坚持其最初的模式：一个松散但价值对齐的职业初创公司投资者联盟，每个人都负责在各自市场建立最高效的投资者和导师社区，并分享信息、最佳实践和后勤基础设施。正如最初一样，90%的经济来源于并返回给本地市场，但Techstars从每个市场累积其10%的利润分享比例，再加上一个可以使其投资于高质量软件工具和整体网络基础设施的管理费。
- en: This model wouldn’t have grown as quickly, and would have required much greater
    selectivity in the markets in which it operated. It would also have required more
    patience from the owners of the network itself, but would have been much more
    likely to serve their long-term goal of massive value creation over time.

  zh: 这种模式不会像现在这样快速增长，并且需要在其运作的市场中进行更大的选择性。这也需要网络所有者更多的耐心，但更有可能在长期内实现他们的巨大价值创造目标。
- en: We’ll never know the answer, but if YC serves as a fair proxy for the type of
    scaled impact and durable value creation that startup accelerators can create,
    Techstars offers an object lesson in the strategic cost of losing sight of your
    core customer in the relentless pursuit of growth. Techstars was and is an organization
    founded by great humans, and its current struggles are shared with many once-promising
    startups that flew too close to the sun in an era when wings were cheap.

  zh: 我们可能永远不会知道答案，但如果YC可以作为创业加速器可以创造的规模化影响和持久价值创造的公平代理，Techstars为追求增长而失去对核心客户的关注提供了一个战略成本的教训。Techstars是一个由伟大人物创立的组织，其当前的困境与许多曾经有前途的初创公司共享，这些公司在翼便宜的时代飞得太接近太阳。
