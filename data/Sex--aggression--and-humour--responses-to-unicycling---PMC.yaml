- en: After retiring from a busy university department in Newcastle upon Tyne, and
    with the time and the need for more than the usual consultancies, I was able follow
    some of my more extreme inclinations. As a cyclist, I had occasionally thought
    of using more or fewer wheels, but it was only when choosing a grandson’s gift
    that I got seriously lost in contemplation of a gleaming chrome unicycle. My wife
    said “buy the bloody” thing, which I did on the whim of the moment. After months
    of practice at home, I graduated to back streets, a small paved park, and finally
    town roads. I couldn’t avoid being noticed; in turn, I couldn’t avoid observing
    the form that notice took. Because at the time there were no other unicyclists
    in the area, such sightings would have been exceptional, yet I soon found that
    the responses to them were stereotyped and predictable. I realised that this indicated
    an underlying biological phenomenon and set about its study.

  zh: 从纽卡斯尔大学繁忙的学院退休后，我有了比通常更多的咨询时间和需要，于是我能够追随一些我更极端的倾向。作为一个骑自行车的人，我偶尔想过使用更多或更少的车轮，但只有在选择孙子的礼物时，我才认真地陷入了对闪亮的铬单车的思考中。我妻子说“买那个该死的”东西，我也就顺势而为。经过几个月在家里的练习，我毕业于小巷、一个小的铺砌的公园，最后是城市道路。我无法避免被注意到；反过来，我无法避免观察到注意的形式。因为当时该地区没有其他的单轮车手，这样的目击会是异常的，然而我很快发现，对它们的反应是刻板的和可以预测的。我意识到这表明了一个潜在的生物现象，并开始研究它。

    snide and proffered combatively as a put-down. Equally striking was their repetitive
    nature, even though given as if original—almost 66% of these “comic” responses
    referred to the number of wheels (the most common), the absence of handlebars,
    or a part having being lost or stolen (box). Less than 25% used less obvious snide
    humour, but often with stylistic repetition. Some remarks were fired off as if
    they had been rehearsed on approach. More often, people paused briefly while trying
    to formulate the response, which was sometimes delivered after I had passed. This
    pause to find a comic phrase contrasted with the immediacy and apparent spontaneity
    of the few laudatory remarks made by men and the many made by women. Some of the

    large enough to overcome this; likewise the subjective assessments of relationships,
    age, and social class. Unicycles take one wheel and one person; confirmation by

  zh: 这项研究的一个优点是，它涉及对意外、自发反应的观察，而不是对先入之见的计划测试。可能的限制是，尽管尝试保持一致性，但刺激可能有所不同；但主要保留是，因为反应不是来自连续的队列或样本，所以研究结果只是半定量的。幸运的是，发现的差异足够大，以克服这一点；同样地，对关系、年龄和社会阶层的主观评估。独轮车只有一个轮子和一个人；通过另一位具有不同风格、外貌、服装、年龄、性别和地点的骑手的确认是可取的，但观察到的反应仍然与所研究的情况相关。
- en: Biological systems are often best defined by stimulation—for example, the heart
    by exercise—but conscious modification makes this less reliable for mental responses.
    Sudden exposure to a novel stimulus lessens the opportunity for this, and the
    unprepared response is more likely to reflect an underlying attitude. Opportunistic
    use of unicycling in this way was validated by the consistency of the response
    to it.

    their repetitiveness, evolution, and sex differences—and the notion that males
    are just expressing a greater sense of humour simply restates an observational
    fact. Social and ethnic differences seemed to soften the male response, and such
    a softening was also noted when unicycling in Framlingham, a small Suffolk town
    to which I had moved from Newcastle. A genetic effect would explain the sex difference,
    but not the waxing and waning of the male response—the simplest and most direct
    explanation is androgen induced virility. Such a causal association fits well
    with the observed evolution to aggression, an attribute related to androgens (figure[f1]),
    but direct endocrine confirmation would require studies not available to a unicyclist.
    The observed aggression could be a male response to confrontation, a situation
    where competition and combativeness are never far away. The male response to female
    unicyclists has yet to be studied, but the results of inquiries to unicyclists
    in other regions and countries suggest that the same jokes about wheels predominate.

  zh: 单车骑行本身就很有趣这一观点无法解释这些发现——尤其是它们的重复性、演变性和性别差异——而认为男性只是表达了更强的幽默感只是重申了一个观察到的事实。社会和民族差异似乎缓解了男性的反应，当我从纽卡斯尔搬到萨福克郡的一个小镇弗拉姆灵厄姆时，当时也注意到了单车骑行中的这种缓解。遗传效应可以解释性别差异，但不能解释男性反应的盛衰——最简单、最直接的解释是雄激素诱导的男性气质。这种因果关联与观察到的进化到攻击性很吻合，攻击性与雄激素有关(图[f1])，但直接的内分泌证实需要一些对单车手不可得的研究。观察到的攻击性可能是男性对抗争的反应，这是一个竞争和好斗永远不会远离的情境。男性对女性单车手的反应尚未研究，但对其他地区和国家的单车手进行的调查结果表明，关于车轮的笑话占主导地位。

    aggressive intent channelled the verbal response into a contrived but more subtle
    and sophisticated joke, in which aggression is concealed by wit. This shows how
    the aggression that leads to humour eventually becomes separated from it as wit,
    jokes, and other comic forms, which then take on an independent life of their
    own.

  zh: 对于幽默的进化来说，最为有趣的是最初的攻击意图如何将口头回应引导为一种虚构但更加微妙和复杂的笑话，其中攻击性被机智所掩盖。这表明了导致幽默的攻击性如何最终分离出来，成为机智、笑话和其他喜剧形式，这些形式随后开始独立存在。
- en: These observations lead to the conclusion that humour evolves from androgen
    primed aggression. But can that conclusion be generalised? Repartee and banter
    have many of the characteristics of controlled aggression—so often revealed when
    control is lost—and it may be no coincidence that quick wit is likened to a rapier.
    The findings may also be relevant to the great male-female divide in humour—women
    tell fewer jokes than men and most comedians are men, despite some notable exceptions.
    The findings also suggest that the difference is sexual rather than social. I
    will not generalise into the many writings on humour—too many of which take an
    armchair view of the bedroom—from Freud on male humour as an aggressive response
    to women to the priapic interpretations of Roman sculptures and the effect of
    salacious comic cartoons on subsequent aggressive behaviour. The range of theoretical
    options on offer is too great and unproved for interpreting or extending a simple
    experimental study such as the response to unicycling.

  zh: 这些观察结果导致了这样一个结论：幽默起源于雄激素激发的攻击性。但这个结论能够推广吗？回击和戏谑具有许多受控制的攻击性特征——当失去控制时经常会表现出来——而且或许并非巧合的是，机智被比作一把击剑。这些发现也许对于男女之间在幽默上的巨大分歧有所启示——女性讲的笑话比男性少，大多数喜剧演员都是男性，尽管也有一些值得注意的例外。这些发现还表明，这种差异是性别而非社会的。我不会对幽默的许多著作进行概括——其中许多著作对床上事务采取了坐在躺椅上的观点——从弗洛伊德关于男性幽默是对女性侵略性回应的看法，到罗马雕塑的阳具解释，以及淫秽漫画对随后攻击性行为的影响。目前提供的理论选择范围过于庞大且未经证实，无法解释或扩展对单车骑行反应这样一个简单实验研究。
- en: The existence of an overwhelming sex difference inevitably raises the possibility
    of biological advantage, in particular whether male humour enhances female sexual
    preference. Marty Feldman, a notoriously unprepossessing comic, had no doubt of
    it, and Diane Keaton said she was mostly won over by men who made her laugh. Darwin’s
    *Descent of Man* defined the dominant evolutionary role of sexual selection.^([1](#ref1))
    The components of mate attraction are becoming defined^([2](#ref2))—the male woos
    and the female selects—and male humour seems to be involved.^([3](#ref3)) The
    present finding that humour may reflect androgen induced aggression could provide
    a Darwinian explanation both of its attraction and its continued use as a sexually
    useful tool.

  zh: 存在压倒性性别差异不可避免地引起了生物优势的可能性，尤其是男性幽默是否增强了女性的性偏好。臭名昭著的丑陋喜剧演员马蒂·费尔德曼毫无疑问，黛安·基顿说她大部分时间都被那些让她笑的男人所吸引。达尔文的《人类的进化》定义了性选择的主导进化作用^([1](#ref1))。配偶吸引的组成部分正在被定义^([2](#ref2))——男性求爱，女性选择——而男性幽默似乎也涉及其中^([3](#ref3))。目前的发现表明，幽默可能反映了睾酮诱导的攻击性，这可能为其吸引力及其作为一种性有用工具的持续使用提供达尔文的解释。

- en: The response to the unexpected and novel stimulus of seeing a unicyclist was
    surprisingly consistent even to the words and gestures used, and these varied
    with age, sex, and stage of sexual development. In males the response moved from
    curiosity in childhood, to physical and verbal aggression in older boys; this
    became more verbal as the boys matured into men and evolved into the concealed
    aggression of a repetitive humorous verbal put-down, which was lost with age.
    In contrast, the female response was praise and concern for safety. These findings
    suggest that humour develops from aggression in response to male hormones.
