- en: 'It’s not just me. Many of the pilot population in my circle confess to having
    the same difficulty: understanding what the heck ATC is saying, and what they
    want us to do. Controllers seem to talk faster, using lots of words. We hate to
    ask them over, but we also don’t want to misunderstand and mess up.'

  zh: 不仅仅是我。我周围的许多飞行员承认他们也有同样的困难：理解ATC在说什么，以及他们想让我们做什么。控制员似乎说话更快，用词更多。我们不愿意再问一遍，但我们也不想误解并搞砸。
- en: In recent years, the problem has been exacerbated. It used to be that pilots
    and controllers communicated in a fairly simple fashion, resorting to plain language
    when it suited. I recall attempting to affect an airline captain’s “Ah’, roger”
    drawl after obtaining my commercial certificate 60-odd years ago. Maybe I threw
    in a “Wilco” once in a while, signifying “will comply.” Instructions and requests
    were traded in a relatively clear manner.

  zh: 近年来，这个问题变得更加严重。过去，飞行员和控制员以一种相对简单的方式进行交流，适时使用简单语言。我记得在60多年前获得商业执照后，我试图模仿航空公司机长的“啊，了解”语调。也许我偶尔会加入一个“Wilco”，表示“我会遵守。”指令和请求以相对清晰的方式进行交换。
- en: We called ground control with an “On the ramp, ready to taxi” and got a terse
    “Taxi to one-eight.” If we wanted help finding our way, we could ask, otherwise,
    it was expected that we knew where the runway was and would call the tower for
    takeoff in due course. The frequency remained relatively uncongested.

  zh: 我们通过“停在停机坪上，准备起飞”来呼叫地面控制台，得到的是简短的“滑行至一八跑道”。如果我们需要帮助找到航线，我们可以询问，否则，我们被期望知道跑道在哪里，并会及时呼叫塔台进行起飞。频率保持相对不拥挤。
- en: But pilots botched up from time to time, blundering into blind-alley taxiways
    or heading across an active runway. So taxi instructions gradually got more complex
    and wordy, first with a mandate to read back all “hold short” instructions and
    then with specific designations for a full-route clearance, all to be repeated
    verbatim.

  zh: 但飞行员偶尔会出错，错误地驶入死胡同滑行道或者穿过活动跑道。因此，滑行指令逐渐变得更加复杂和啰嗦，首先是要求回复所有“停在跑道前”的指令，然后是对完整路线的特定指定，所有这些都必须逐字重复。
- en: “Taxi to one-eight” became “Taxi to Runway 18 via Juliet, Alpha, and Romeo,
    hold short of Runway 31, confirm you have information Delta.” We soon learned
    we could get away with parroting “Taxi 18, Juliet/Alpha/Romeo, hold short 31,
    we have Delta.”

  zh: “滑行至一八跑道”变成了“经由朱莉叶、阿尔法和罗密欧滑行至18号跑道，停在31号跑道前，确认你已收到Delta信息。” 我们很快就学会了只用“滑行18，朱叶/阿尔法/罗密欧，停在31前，我们收到Delta。”
- en: Back in the beginning, we simply acknowledged receipt of a clearance by replying
    with our N-number, clipped to the last three ciphers if the tower had so stated
    it, just enough to assure that the right airplane heard the word from above. In
    all cases, the conversation was being recorded, and confirmation was important
    in the event of an investigation.

  zh: 在最开始的时候，我们只需回复我们的N号码，如果塔台要求这样做，只需剪裁到最后三位数字，足以确保正确的飞机听到了上面的指令。在所有情况下，对话都被记录下来，确认对话对于调查事件至关重要。
- en: At this point, the controller’s manual requires controllers to state so many
    more advisory reminders, much of which we dutifully repeat back, that the frequency
    is filled with rapid-fire, nearly unintelligible verbiage, filed away in our mental
    cavities but not truly listened to. But, duty must be done.

  zh: 在这一点上，控制员手册要求控制员陈述更多的提醒建议，其中大部分我们都会忠实地重复回答，导致频率充斥着快速、几乎无法理解的用语，存放在我们的头脑中，但并没有真正倾听。但是，职责必须完成。
- en: The danger is that habitual repetition leads to hearing what we expect to hear,
    not what was truly said.

  zh: 危险在于习惯性的重复导致我们听到我们期望听到的，而不是真正被说的话。
- en: “Cleared for the visual, report three mile left base for Runway 31,” becomes
    “Cleared to land, 31” in our mind, even though we read back the visual and report
    instructions. Or, as in the case of the Hawker crew at Houston recently, “Line
    up and wait” was interpreted as “Cleared for takeoff,” leading them to clip the
    tail of a cross-landing Citation. The old pre-ICAO “Position and hold” instruction
    was much more declarative, in my humble opinion.

  zh: “Cleared for the visual, report three mile left base for Runway 31,” 在我们的脑海中变成了“准许降落，31号跑道”，即使我们读出了视觉和报告的指示。
    或者，就像最近在休斯顿的豪克机组一样，“排队等待”被解释为“准许起飞”，导致他们剪到了一架横穿跑道的零式飞机的尾巴。 在我看来，旧的ICAO前“位置和等待”指令更为明确。
- en: My associates and I are now given to speaking slower, at the risk of overstaying
    our welcome on frequency, in hopes that ATC will reciprocate in intelligible delivery.
    Even so, well-meaning imposition of advisories and southern-exposure protections
    burden controllers with so much “New Speak” that we long for the days of shorter
    communication.

  zh: 我和我的同事现在倾向于说话更慢，冒着频率上过留的风险，希望空中交通管制员能以清晰的方式回应。 即便如此，善意的咨询和南部曝光保护的强加使得空中交通管制员面临着如此多的“新说话”，以至于我们渴望回到交流更简短的时代。
