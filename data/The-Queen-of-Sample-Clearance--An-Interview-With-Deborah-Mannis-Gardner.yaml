- en: Deborah Mannis-Gardner doesn’t rap or produce, but you’ll likely spy her on
    more album credits than all of the 808 mafias combined. One of America’s leading
    clearance agents, Deborah has spent 20 years dodging red tape to acquire music
    for film, samples and video games. Her role includes hunting obscure records,
    checking artists get their dough and putting the G-Funk in *Grand Theft Auto.*

  zh: 黛博拉·曼尼斯-加德纳并不说唱或制作音乐，但你很可能在专辑的制作名单上看到她的名字，比起所有的808帮派加在一起还要多。作为美国领先的版权清理代理人之一，黛博拉已经花了20年时间越过繁文缛节，为电影、采样和视频游戏获取音乐。她的角色包括寻找晦涩的唱片、确保艺术家得到他们的报酬，并在《侠盗猎车手》中注入了G-Funk的风格。
- en: Mannis-Gardner’s clients include Cash Money, Kanye, Rick Ross, Nas, Diddy and
    almost every other private jet gaucho. She fights for superstars as well as minor
    artists and is fervently against clearance becoming solely a millionaire’s game.
    Deborah’s vocal about protecting the culture of sampling and despite the thirsty
    trend of litigation, is yet to be taken to court. The feisty Jewish woman, who
    loves rap, discussed her favourite unreleased track, urban artists being unfairly
    sued, repercussions from the “Blurred Lines” lawsuit and getting Diddy on the
    phone with Enya.

    I try to make it really clear that it’s about the sample, what they’ve used, how
    they’ve used it and the final outcome of the new song. It should be irrelevant
    who sampled it, especially with what the quote is, so if Marshall [Eminem] sampled
    something, it shouldn’t be a higher quote because it’s going to make a lot of
    money or a lower quote because you want to cut him a break.

    quote should be based on the use of the sample and that’s really important. I
    think sampling is an art and I think it’s incredible. When I first started, I
    was told how it was theft. I was told that hip-hop and rap was a phase. That it
    wasn’t going to be around. All of that horrible, negative stuff. I kept saying
    “well, a collage, that’s not real art? Jambalaya isn’t real food?” That’s a great
    meal mixed up of different foods and spices, that’s what sampling is. Remember
    when there was like six or seven samples in a song and they used pieces of things
    like spice, adding little sounds to make something great? What about the fact
    that sampling took music and made it relevant again? It brought James Brown back
    to life. I don’t care what anyone says, it brought attention to artists that people
    didn’t even remember.

    even allow his stuff to be sampled anymore. I’m very disappointed in the whole
    situation. I wasn’t happy with the people that spoke on behalf of the Marvin Gaye
    side. The fact that they sequestered and did not allow Dr. Ferrara’s musicology
    report to be reviewed. He’s the pre-eminent musicologist that everyone uses in
    the hip-hop community whenever anyone questions anything. He’s the person that
    the Gaye Estate hired and then they withdrew his report. So obviously he proved

    and Puff’s manager. Puff sat down with Bowie, years ago to make that happen. [Deborah
    is referring to the Diddy song “Been Around The World”, which samples David Bowie’s
    “Let’s Dance”].

  zh: Puff 的才华在于... 进行了很多次会议，最初大卫·鲍伊拒绝了 Puff 的采样请求，然后我联系了亨利·伦-梅勒克和 Puff 的经纪人。Puff
    多年前与鲍伊坐下来，才让这件事情发生。[Deborah 在提到 Diddy 的歌曲 “Been Around The World”，其中采样了大卫·鲍伊的
    “Let’s Dance”]。
- en: When people would say “no” to Puff, we would get Puff to sit down and meet with
    people. I have to tell you something, as much as the press covers him as, you
    know, this big mouth, attitude, blah blah blah, there’s a side of him, like where
    he called a friend of mine, who is the manager of this band, and when he called
    himself he didn’t even introduce himself as Puff. He introduced himself by saying
    [shy, quiet voice] “hi… this is Sean Combs, also known as Puffy.” That’s how he
    introduced himself. He was very respectful, very polite. There’s another side
    of him that people don’t always see, that I see and the people that I’ve introduced
    him to have seen.</fbs-ad>

  zh: 当人们对 Puff 说“不”的时候，我们会让 Puff 坐下来与人会面。我必须告诉你一件事，虽然媒体总是把他描述成这个大嘴巴、有态度的人，但是他还有另一面，比如他给我一个朋友打电话，这位朋友是这个乐队的经理，他打电话时甚至没有自我介绍为
    Puff，而是以 [害羞、安静的声音] “嗨... 我是肖恩·康姆斯，也被称为 Puffy。” 这就是他自我介绍的方式。他非常尊重，非常有礼貌。他还有一个人们不经常看到的一面，我看到了，我介绍过他的人也看到了。</fbs-ad>
