- en: “Consumer views were supported by confidence that inflation has turned a corner
    and strengthening income expectations,” Joanne Hsu, the university’s surveys of
    consumers director, said in a release. “Over the last two months, sentiment has
    climbed a cumulative 29%, the largest two-month increase since 1991 as a recession
    ended.”

- en: Inflation eased markedly throughout 2023 without a sharp rise in unemployment,
    which has helped perk up moods among US consumers in recent months. It remains
    to be seen whether inflation could drift all the way to the Federal Reserve’s
    2% target without interest rates staying higher for longer or triggering massive

    That’s transmitted directly through prices at the pump, which have been falling
    since September, and less directly given wage increases have risen above the rate
    of inflation,” Robert Frick, corporate economist at Navy Federal Credit Union,
    said in a note Friday. “The strong jobs market also heavily influences Americans’
    view of the economy in general.”

    before inflation exploded. Prices aren’t likely to return to pre-pandemic levels,
    absent a deep recession, because even in an immaculate economy, prices would ideally
    rise by at least 2%.

    not play out; that the balance of supply and demand in the labor market, which
