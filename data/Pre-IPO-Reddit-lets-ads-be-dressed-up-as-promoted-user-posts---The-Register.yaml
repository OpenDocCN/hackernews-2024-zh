- en: What's happening here is that advertisers can use the Reddit Ads Manager to
    create adverts that have all the qualities of normal user posts – photos, videos,
    lists, megathreads, etc – and then pay to make them appear prominently on the
    site and in the app as promoted posts, aka adverts. Up until now, brands typically
    have had to book an ad that links out to an external site, such as a landing page
    selling some stuff, or an ad that links to a separate user post on Reddit, or
    a banner ad. Those options are still available though not as fully featured as
    free-form ads.

  zh: 这里发生的是广告主可以使用Reddit广告管理器创建具有正常用户帖子所有特征的广告，如照片、视频、列表和超级主题等，然后付费使其在网站和应用中显著显示为推广帖子，即广告。直到现在，品牌通常需要预订一个指向外部网站的广告，比如一个销售商品的落地页，或者一个链接到Reddit上的单独用户帖子的广告，或者一个横幅广告。这些选项仍然可用，尽管不如自由格式广告功能完善。

    via the Ads Manager. There's no need to create a separate user post that an ad
    links to, for instance.

- en: All free-form adverts are supposed to show some kind of sponsored label, though
    that doesn't appear to be the case on the three posts included in this story.
    While Leica's shows it, neither Philadelphia post includes a tag indicating it's
    sponsored content. We understand that's because the Philadelphia posts are no
    longer boosted by ad spending, so are back to just being normal user posts.

  zh: 所有自由形式广告应该显示某种赞助标签，尽管这在本文提到的三篇帖子中并不明显。虽然莱卡的帖子显示了这一点，但费城的帖子中没有标明其为赞助内容。我们了解到这是因为费城的帖子不再通过广告支出进行推广，因此只是普通用户的帖子。
