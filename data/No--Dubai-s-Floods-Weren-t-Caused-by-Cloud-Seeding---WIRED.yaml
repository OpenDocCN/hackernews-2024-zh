    seeding. The UAE has a long-running program for trying to squeeze more rain out
    of the clouds that pass over the normally arid region—it has a team of pilots
    who spray salt particles into passing storms to encourage more water to form.
    The floods were positioned as a cautionary tale by [some](https://twitter.com/paindoo_jatt/status/1780497555995886019):
    Here’s what happens when you mess with nature. Even [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-04-16/dubai-grinds-to-standstill-as-cloud-seeding-worsens-flooding)
    reported that cloud seeding had worsened the flooding.'

  zh: 新闻报道和社交媒体帖子迅速将责任推到云种植身上。阿联酋长期以来一直有一个计划，试图从通常干旱的地区经过的云层中挤出更多的雨水——它有一支团队的飞行员在经过的风暴中喷洒盐粒子，以促使更多水汽形成。有些人将洪水定位为一则警示故事：当你试图干预自然时，结果会怎样。甚至[彭博社](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-04-16/dubai-grinds-to-standstill-as-cloud-seeding-worsens-flooding)也报道称，云种植加剧了洪水情况。
- en: The truth is more complicated. I’ve spent the past few months reporting on cloud
    seeding in the UAE for an upcoming WIRED feature, and while it’s true that the
    UAE has been running cloud seeding missions this week—it performs more than 300
    a year—it’s a stretch to say that it was responsible for the floods. (In fact,
    as we were preparing this story for publication on Wednesday morning, the UAE’s
    National Center for Meteorology [told CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/04/17/uae-denies-cloud-seeding-took-place-before-severe-dubai-floods.html?taid=661f973b35bd2b0001b31b0a&utm_campaign=trueanthem&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter%7Cmain)

- en: 'There are a few reasons for this. First: Even the most optimistic assessments
    of cloud seeding say that it can increase rainfall by a maximum of 25 percent
    annually. In other words, it would have rained anyway, and if cloud seeding did
    have an impact, it would have been to only slightly increase the amount of precipitation
    that fell. The jury is still out on the effectiveness of cloud seeding in warm
    climates, and even if it does work, cloud seeding can’t produce rain out of thin
    air, it can only enhance what’s already in the sky.'

  zh: 这背后有几个原因。首先：即使对于云种植最乐观的评估也指出，它每年最多只能增加降雨量的25%。换句话说，无论如何都会下雨，如果云种植确实有影响，它只会稍微增加降水量。云种植在温暖气候中的有效性还有待评估，即使它有效果，云种植也不能在空中产生雨水，它只能增强已有天空中的降水量。
- en: Secondly, seeding operations tend to take place in the east of the country,
    far from more populated areas like Dubai. This is largely because of restrictions
    on air traffic, and means it was unlikely that any seeding particles were still
    active by the time the storms reached Dubai. Most of the scientists I’ve spoken
    to say the impact of cloud seeding has a very small, localized effect and is unlikely
    to cause flooding in other areas. But perhaps the best evidence that cloud seeding
    wasn’t involved in these floods is the fact that it rained all over the region.
    Oman didn’t do any cloud seeding, but it was even more badly affected by flooding,
    with a number of casualties.

  zh: 其次，种植作业往往在该国东部地区进行，远离迪拜等人口较多的地区。 这主要是由于对航空交通的限制，这意味着在暴风雨到达迪拜时，种植粒子很可能不再活跃。 我与大多数科学家交谈过，他们表示云种植的影响非常小，局部化效果，不太可能导致其他地区的洪水。
    但也许最好的证据表明云种植并未参与这些洪水的事实是，整个地区都下雨了。 阿曼没有进行任何云种植，但洪水影响更为严重，造成了一些伤亡。
- en: 'It’s exciting to point the finger at a scary technology, but the real cause
    of the flooding is likely more banal: Dubai is comically ill-equipped to deal
    with rainfall. The city has expanded rapidly over the past few decades, with little
    attention paid to infrastructure like storm drains that could help it deal with
    a sudden influx of water. It’s largely concrete and glass, and there’s very little
    green space to soak up rainfall. The result is chaos whenever it rains—though
    to be fair, most cities would struggle to deal with a year’s worth of rain falling
    in [12 hours](https://edition.cnn.com/2024/04/16/weather/dubai-rain-flooding-climate/index.html).'

  zh: 指责一种可怕的技术很令人兴奋，但洪水的真正原因可能更加平淡：迪拜在应对降雨方面显然设施严重不足。 过去几十年来，这座城市迅速扩展，几乎没有注意像排水沟这样的基础设施，这些基础设施可以帮助它处理突如其来的大水量。
    迪拜主要是水泥和玻璃建筑，几乎没有绿地来吸收降雨。 结果就是每次下雨都会一片混乱——虽然公平地说，大多数城市都会在[12 hours](https://edition.cnn.com/2024/04/16/weather/dubai-rain-flooding-climate/index.html)内降下一年的降水量时感到头疼。
- en: However, climate change may also be playing a role. As the planet heats up,
    the complex weather dynamics of the region are shifting and changing in ways that
    may bring more violent storms. City planners around the world are trying to make
    their cities “[spongier](https://www.wired.com/story/the-designer-whos-trying-to-transform-your-city-into-a-sponge/)”
    to help deal with flash flooding and save more water for drier parts of the year.
    Instead of using cloud seeding to turn the sky into a sponge, Dubai would be better
    off trying to turn the city into one.
