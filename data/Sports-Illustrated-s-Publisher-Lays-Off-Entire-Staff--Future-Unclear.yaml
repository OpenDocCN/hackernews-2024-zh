    Group to publish *SI* in print and digital, according to an email obtained by
    *Front Office Sports*. That move comes three weeks after Arena missed a $3.75
    million payment that breached the company’s *SI* licensing deal, which began in
    2019. (Authentic’s notice of termination, meanwhile, triggered a $45 million fee
    due immediately to Authentic, according to an [SEC filing](https://investors.thearenagroup.net/node/11171/html) on
