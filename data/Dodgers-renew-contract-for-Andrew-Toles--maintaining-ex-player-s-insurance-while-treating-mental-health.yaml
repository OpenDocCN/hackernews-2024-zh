    made a quiet, yet notable move on Wednesday, renewing the contract of former outfielder
    Andrew Toles, [according to the Associated Press](https://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/39724914/o-gunnar-henderson-adley-rutschman-mlb-contract-renewals).

  zh: 洛杉矶道奇队（[Los Angeles Dodgers](https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/LAD/los-angeles-dodgers/)）在周三进行了一项低调但显著的动作，续签了前外野手安德鲁·托尔斯的合同，根据[美联社报道](https://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/39724914/o-gunnar-henderson-adley-rutschman-mlb-contract-renewals)。
- en: Toles, 31, has not played in the majors since 2018\. He's been on the restricted
    list since March 2019 because of mental health issues. (He was subsequently diagnosed
    with bipolar disorder and schizophrenia.) There's no reason to believe he'll ever
    take another swing, for the Dodgers or anyone else. Nevertheless, the Dodgers
    have continued to renew his contract each spring so that he maintains his health
    insurance. It's a shockingly decent act in an industry that too often loses touch
    with humanity.

  zh: 31岁的托尔斯自2018年以来没有在大联盟出场。自2019年3月以来，他因精神健康问题被限制出场名单。（随后被诊断出患有躁郁症和精神分裂症。）没有理由认为他会再为道奇队或其他球队挥杆。尽管如此，道奇队每个春天继续续签他的合同，以便他保持健康保险。在这个经常失去人性联系的行业中，这是一个令人震惊的体面行为。
- en: Toles appeared in 96 games for the Dodgers from 2016-18, hitting for a 111 OPS+
    and even batting .462/.467/.615 in the 2016 National League Championship Series.
    Back in 2021, [USA Today reported](https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/mlb/columnist/bob-nightengale/2020/06/30/andrew-toles-dodgers-homeless-mental-illness/3285031001/)
    that he had been in "at least" 20 mental health clinics since leaving the Dodgers.
    After Toles was found sleeping at a Florida airport following a 2020 arrest, his
    father, Alvin, gained legal guardianship and brought him back to Fairburn, Georgia.

    I mean, he can''t even watch TV. He hears voices and the TV at the same time,

    laptop, but I don''t think he really understands what''s going on. I just want
    him to have a chance in life. That''s all. Just to be healthy, live a normal life."'

    are allowed to "renew" contracts of players who are not arbitration eligible each
    spring. The restricted list, meanwhile, is an official designation that allows
