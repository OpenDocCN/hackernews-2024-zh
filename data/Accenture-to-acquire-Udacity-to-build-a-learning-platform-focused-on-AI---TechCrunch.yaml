  zh: Accenture今天宣布将收购[学习平台Udacity](https://newsroom.accenture.com/news/2024/accenture-to-acquire-edtech-leader-udacity-to-accelerate-capabilities-of-accenture-learnvantage)，作为构建专注于日益增长的人工智能兴趣的学习平台的努力的一部分。虽然公司没有明确指出收购Udacity的金额，但它还宣布将投资10亿美元建设一种名为LearnVantage的技术学习平台。
- en: While it could also offer more general technology training, the company made
    clear that it is particularly interested in offering training to get workers up
    to speed on AI. “The rise of generative AI represents one of the most transformative
    changes in how work gets done and is driving a growing need for enterprises to
    train and upskill people in cloud, data and AI as they build their digital core
    and reinvent their enterprises,” Kishore Durg, global lead of Accenture LearnVantage
    said in a statement.

  zh: 尽管它也可以提供更广泛的技术培训，但该公司明确表示特别希望提供培训，使工人能够迅速掌握人工智能的知识。Accenture LearnVantage的全球负责人Kishore
    Durg在一份声明中表示：“生成式人工智能的崛起代表了工作方式发生根本变革的最具变革性之一，并促使企业在构建其数字核心和重塑企业过程中，对云、数据和人工智能的培训和技能提升需求不断增长。”
- en: As for Udacity, which was founded in 2011, it gave the usual kinds of statements
    a company makes when it gets acquired by a much larger organization like Accenture.
    That is, it believes that it can reach more people and help them acquire skills
    as part of the larger entity. That goes without saying, but there had been [rumors
    earlier this year](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/startups/upgrad-in-talks-for-100-million-to-close-us-edtech-udacity-buy/articleshow/106842130.cms?from=mdr)
    that the company was in talks with Indian edtech company Upgrad with an asking
    price of $80 million. Apparently that deal fell through and Accenture ended up
    buying them instead.

  zh: 至于成立于2011年的Udacity，在被像Accenture这样的大型组织收购时，它发表了一些通常情况下公司被收购后会发表的声明。换句话说，它认为作为更大实体的一部分，它可以触达更多人并帮助他们获取技能。这是毋庸置疑的，但今年早些时候已有[传闻](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/startups/upgrad-in-talks-for-100-million-to-close-us-edtech-udacity-buy/articleshow/106842130.cms?from=mdr)，称该公司正在与印度edtech公司Upgrad进行谈判，要价8000万美元。显然，那笔交易未能达成，Accenture最终选择了收购它们。
- en: Regardless, if the rumored $80 million price tag was correct, that was a precipitous
    drop in value for a company that raised almost $300 million, [per PitchBook](https://my.pitchbook.com/profile/54606-61/company/profile#general-info),
    and sported a $1 billion valuation in 2015.

  zh: 不过，如果传言中的8000万美元价格标签属实，那对于一家几乎筹集了3亿美元资金并在2015年估值达到10亿美元的公司来说，这是一个急剧的贬值。[根据PitchBook](https://my.pitchbook.com/profile/54606-61/company/profile#general-info)。
