- en: Lithium-ion batteries power many devices that we use every day as well as electric
    vehicles. They would also be a necessary part of a green electric grid, as batteries
    are required to store renewable energy from wind turbines and solar panels. But
    [lithium is expensive](/article/mg24933180-600-were-running-out-of-lithium-for-batteries-can-we-use-salt-instead/)
    and mining it [damages the environment](/article/mg25333710-200-lithium-fields-beautiful-from-the-air-trouble-on-the-ground/).
    Finding a replacement for this crucial metal could be costly and time-consuming,
    requiring researchers to develop and test millions of candidates over the course
    of years. Using AI, [Nathan Baker](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nathanandrewbaker/)
    at Microsoft and his colleagues accomplished the task in months. They designed
    and built a battery that uses up to 70 per cent less lithium than some competing
    designs.

  zh: 锂离子电池驱动着我们每天使用的许多设备以及电动汽车。它们也将是绿色电网的必要组成部分，因为电池需要存储风力涡轮机和太阳能电池板的可再生能源。但是[锂很昂贵](/article/mg24933180-600-were-running-out-of-lithium-for-batteries-can-we-use-salt-instead/)，而开采它
    [会破坏环境](/article/mg25333710-200-lithium-fields-beautiful-from-the-air-trouble-on-the-ground/)。寻找这种关键金属的替代品可能会耗资巨大且耗时，需要研究人员在数年的时间内开发和测试数百万种候选材料。使用人工智能，微软的[Nathan
    Baker](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nathanandrewbaker/)及其同事们在几个月内完成了任务。他们设计并建造了一种电池，其锂使用量比某些竞争设计少多达
    70%。
- en: The researchers focused on a type of battery that [only contains solid parts](/article/2398896-what-are-solid-state-batteries-and-why-do-we-need-them/),
    and they looked for new materials for the battery component that electric charges
    move through, called the electrolyte. They started with 23.6 million [candidate
    materials](/article/2404929-crystal-hunting-deepmind-ai-could-help-discover-new-wonder-materials/)
    designed by tweaking the structure of established electrolytes and swapping out
    some lithium atoms for other elements. An AI algorithm then eliminated the materials
    that it calculated would be unstable, as well as those in which the chemical reactions
    that make batteries work would be weak. The researchers also considered how each
    material would behave while the battery was actively working. After only a few
    days, their list contained just a few hundred candidates, some of which had never
    been studied before.

    Northwest National Laboratory in Washington state was one of the scientists who
    picked up the phone. He and his colleagues suggested additional screening criteria
    for the AI. After more elimination rounds, Murugesan’s team ultimately picked
    one of the AI’s suggestions to synthesise in the lab. It stood out because half
    of what Murugesan would have expected to be lithium atoms were replaced with sodium.
    He says that this is a very novel recipe for an electrolyte and that having the
    two elements together opens questions about the basic physics of how the material
    works inside a battery.'

    than similar prototypes that use more lithium. Baker and Murugesan both say that
    lots of work is left to optimise the new battery. However, the process of making
    it – from the first time Murugesan spoke to the Microsoft team to the battery
    being functional enough to turn on a light bulb – took about nine months.

- en: “The methods here are bleeding edge, in terms of machine learning tools, but
    what really elevates this is that things got made and tested,” says [Rafael Gómez-Bombarelli](https://dmse.mit.edu/faculty/rafael-gomez-bombarelli/)
    at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, who was not involved with the project.
    “It’s very easy to do predictions; it’s hard to convince someone to invest on
    actual experiments.” He says that the team used AI to accelerate and augment calculations
    that physicists have been doing for decades. But this approach may still run into
    obstacles in the future. The [data needed to train the AI](/article/2388562-a-map-of-every-conceivable-molecule-could-be-possible-with-ai/)
    for this type of work is often sparse, and materials other than battery components
    may require a more complex way of combining elements, he says.

    他说，团队利用人工智能加速和增强了几十年来物理学家一直在做的计算。但这种方法在未来仍可能遇到障碍。他表示，为这类工作训练人工智能所需的数据通常很少，而且除了电池组件之外的材料可能需要更复杂的元素组合方式。
