  zh: 美联社华盛顿专稿：周四，陪审团裁定向气候科学家迈克尔·曼颁发100万美元，他于12年前起诉两位保守派作家，后者将其关于全球变暖的描述与一名已定罪的儿童侵犯者进行比较。

    published a blog post by Rand Simberg, then a fellow at the organization, that
    compared investigations into Mann’s work to the case of Jerry Sandusky, a former

- en: Mann’s research was investigated after his and other scientists’ emails were
    leaked in 2009 in an incident that brought further scrutiny of the “hockey stick”
    graph, with skeptics claiming Mann manipulated data. Investigations by Penn State

- en: “Mann could be said to be the Jerry Sandusky of climate science, except for
    instead of molesting children, he has molested and tortured data,” Simberg wrote.
    Another writer, Mark Steyn, later referenced Simberg’s article in his own piece
    in National Review, calling Mann’s research “fraudulent.”

- en: The jury in Superior Court of the District of Columbia found that Simberg and
    Steyn made false statements, awarding Mann $1 in compensatory damages from each
    writer. It awarded punitive damages of $1,000 from Simberg and $1 million from
    Steyn, after finding that the pair made their statements with “maliciousness,
    spite, ill will, vengeance or deliberate intent to harm.”
