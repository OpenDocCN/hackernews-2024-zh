- en: I'm following with somewhat vague interest the various legal battles Apple is
    currently involved in. Reading their response to the EU's DMA makes me sad. Not
    for the company itself. I honestly could not care less about the company. Nor
    for the people who run that company. I'm sad because the pursuit of endless growth
    is such a mind cancer. It consumes and distracts everyone. If you're an artisan,
    creating amazing objects is your end goal. Ideally, you want those objects to
    last forever. And if they don't, you want to do such an amazing job that once
    something is broken beyond repair, people will come to you again and ask you to
    make something new, rather than buying from someone else.

  zh: 我在以稍微模糊的兴趣关注苹果目前卷入的各种法律斗争。阅读他们对欧盟数字市场法案的回应让我感到悲哀。不是为了公司本身。我对公司本身完全无所谓。也不为那些经营该公司的人。我感到悲哀是因为无休止增长的追求就像一种心灵癌症。它消耗并分散了每个人的注意力。如果你是一名工匠，创造令人惊叹的物品是你的最终目标。理想情况下，你希望这些物品永远持久。即使它们不能，你也希望做得如此出色，以至于一旦某物损坏无法修复，人们会再次来找你，请你做出新的东西，而不是从别人那里购买。
- en: Apple makes amazing products. I bought the laptop I'm typing this 9 years ago.
    It still works fine. Sure, it's slow compared to my new machine but I can use
    it to do calls and write blog posts. And that's great. I love it. I was happy
    to give Apple my money back in 2015\. But you know who's not happy? Apple. Apple
    is not happy that I bought a laptop in 2015 that was so good that it is still
    working fine 9 years later. And it's also not happy that I bought a phone more
    than 4 years ago that still does all the things I need it to do. Because they
    need to make money. More money. There's no end state here. *"More"* has no end
    state. At some point, a company like Apple will inevitably run out of people willing
    to buy their stuff. Because it's unreasonable to expect people to upgrade phones,
    laptops, screens, watches, tablets, virtual-ski-goggles every damn year. And so
    what do they do? They move into services. Music, movies, games, fitness, storage.
    You name it. But those also can't grow forever. Because guess what? There are
    other companies out there doing the same.

  zh: 苹果制造了令人惊艳的产品。我买了我正在打字的这台笔记本电脑9年前。它仍然很好用。当然，与我的新机器相比速度慢了点，但我可以用它来打电话和写博客。这很棒。我喜欢它。2015年我很高兴把钱给了苹果。但你知道谁不高兴吗？苹果。苹果不高兴我2015年买了一台笔记本电脑，而这台电脑仍然在9年后运行良好。而且他们也不高兴我4年多前买了一部手机，这部手机仍然能够完成我需要做的一切事情。因为他们需要赚钱。更多的钱。这里没有终点。*"更多"*没有终点。在某一点上，像苹果这样的公司最终会没有人愿意购买他们的产品。因为期望人们每年升级手机、笔记本电脑、屏幕、手表、平板电脑、虚拟滑雪护目镜是不合理的。那么他们会怎么做呢？他们转向服务。音乐、电影、游戏、健身、存储。无所不包。但这些也不能永远增长。因为猜猜看？还有其他公司在做同样的事情。
- en: But they can't stop. They're a public company. If they're not growing enough
    it means they're failing. Forget that they make amazing products that can last
    decades with no issues. Forget that they're an almost 3-fucking-trillions dollar
    company. If they're not growing enough, stock goes down and that's no good. Because
    remember, there's no finish line here. They can't just be happy with their size.
    They can't be happy with the idea of employing thousands of smart people and creating
    amazing products. No, they have to keep growing. And sooner or later, this mind
    cancer becomes malignant.

  zh: 但是他们不能停止。他们是一家上市公司。如果他们的增长不够，这意味着他们失败了。忘记他们生产的能够持续数十年而没有问题的令人惊艳的产品吧。忘记他们是一家近三万亿美元的公司。如果他们的增长不够，股价就会下跌，这对他们来说不是好事。因为记住，这里没有终点。他们不能仅仅对自己的规模感到满意。他们不能满足于雇佣成千上万聪明人并创造惊人产品的想法。不，他们必须继续增长。而迟早，这种心灵癌症会变得恶性。
- en: Don't get me wrong, this is not just an Apple issue. It's an issue with any
    big company. It's an issue with everyone who can't accept that they reached their
    end state.

- en: Cory Doctorow famously coined the enshittification term to describe the sad
    trend of online services going to shit over time. I don't think that's just an
    online services issue. It's a societal issue related to the pursuit of endless
    growth. And if you think about it, it's a deeply human issue. It's what happens
    when you can't say stop. No matter what you're doing, it can be something positive
    or negative, if you can't say stop, bad things will happen. Try to go for a run,
    and don't stop. Ever. Or try to drink water, and don't stop. Ever.

  zh: 科里·多克托罗曾经有名地创造了“糟糕化”这个词来描述在线服务随着时间变得糟糕的悲哀趋势。我认为这不仅仅是在线服务的问题。这是一个与无止境增长追求有关的社会问题。如果你仔细想想，这是一个深刻的人类问题。这就是当你无法说停止时会发生的事情。不管你做什么，无论是积极的还是消极的，如果你不能说停止，坏事就会发生。试着去跑步，永远不停。或者试着喝水，永远不停。
- en: But it's our fault. Our as a society. We celebrate when Apple becomes the first
    trillion-dollar company but we don't celebrate when someone says *"You know what?
    I think I have enough"*.
