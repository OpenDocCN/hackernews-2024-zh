  zh: 看起来苹果确实在尽其所能让第三方iOS应用商店在欧盟新的合规规则下成为对任何希望利用它们的用户或开发者的痛处。
- en: Hot on the heels of Apple [releasing iOS 17.4](https://www.theregister.com/2024/03/06/ios_17_4_eu_compliance/)
    to comply with the European Union's Digital Markets Act rules (which force it
    to give users greater control over their devices), Apple has published a [help
    page](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/118110) describing not only how it intends
    to track EU users eligible for the new permissions, but also how it'll shut down
    access for Europeans spending too much time outside the bloc.

  zh: 苹果发布了符合欧盟数字市场法规的iOS 17.4版本后不久（该法规要求苹果为用户提供更大的设备控制权），苹果还发布了一篇帮助页面，描述了它打算如何跟踪符合新权限的欧盟用户，以及如何关闭对在欧盟以外过多逗留的用户的访问权限。
- en: Along with obviously needing an Apple ID registered in an eligible EU nation
    (listed on the help page), Apple will use on-device processing to collect "an
    indicator of eligibility" that's transmitted to Apple. That indicator will need
    to include determining where the device is located, but Apple said it won't actually
    collect device location.

  zh: 除了明显需要在符合条件的欧盟国家注册的Apple ID（列在帮助页面上），苹果还将使用设备上的处理来收集“符合条件的指标”，该指标将被传输到苹果。该指标需要包括确定设备位置，但苹果表示实际上不会收集设备位置。
- en: EU residents who leave the continent for short-term travel won't notice any
    effect, and will continue to have access to what Apple calls "alternative app
    marketplaces" and the apps installed from said markets. However, "If you're gone
    for too long, you'll lose access to some features, including installing new alternative
    app marketplaces," Apple said.

  zh: 离开欧洲短期旅行的欧盟居民不会注意到任何影响，并将继续访问苹果称为“替代应用市场”和从这些市场安装的应用。但是，苹果表示，“如果你离开时间太长，将失去一些功能，包括安装新的替代应用市场。”
- en: It's not clear how long the grace period is, or when Apple will disable alternative
    app marketplaces for EU residents traveling abroad. It's also not clear how often
    Apple collects indicators of eligibility, or what other features may be disabled
    (eg, [non-WebKit browser engines](https://www.theregister.com/2024/01/25/apple_eu_dma/).)
    We've asked Apple for a statement, but haven't heard back.

  zh: 尚不清楚宽限期有多长，或者苹果何时会禁用欧盟居民在国外旅行期间的替代应用市场。苹果收集符合条件的指标的频率以及可能禁用的其他功能（例如，[非WebKit浏览器引擎](https://www.theregister.com/2024/01/25/apple_eu_dma/)）也没有明确说明。我们已经向苹果发出了一份声明请求，但尚未收到回复。
- en: As for what alternative app marketplace users stand to lose if they spend too
    much time abroad, Apple doesn't mention deleting app marketplaces or their apps,
    but does say that "they can't be updated by the marketplace you downloaded them
    from."

  zh: 对于在国外逗留时间过长的替代应用市场用户可能会失去的东西，苹果并未提及删除应用市场或其应用程序，但确实表示“它们无法通过下载它们的市场更新”。
- en: '"If not properly managed, alternative app marketplaces pose increased privacy,
    safety and security risks for users and developers," Apple noted, taking the same
    line it''s been pushing since it announced moves to comply with the DMA. Ironically
    enough, Apple made that statement on its help page right after saying it wouldn''t
    allow EU residents to update apps from alternative marketplaces, leaving users
    vulnerable to the very issues it said would arise from complying with the DMA.'

  zh: “如果管理不当，替代应用市场将给用户和开发者带来增加的隐私、安全和安全风险，”苹果指出，这与其宣布将遵守DMA的举措一样。具有讽刺意味的是，苹果在它的帮助页面上发表了这一声明，就在它说不允许欧盟居民从替代市场更新应用之后，这使用户容易受到它所说的符合DMA会引起的问题的影响。
