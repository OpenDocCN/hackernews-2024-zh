- en: If you have read [my theories on Wealth Inequality and the economy](https://www.wealtheconomics.org/introduction-2/),
    you will see that Wealth Inequality is the cause of most of the key problems facing
    our economies today – Wealth Inequality causes low wages, it causes high house
    prices, and it causes a lack of jobs in certain industries and geographic areas
    of the world.

  zh: 如果你读过[我的财富不平等和经济理论](https://www.wealtheconomics.org/introduction-2/)，你会发现财富不平等是我们今天经济面临的大多数关键问题的根源——财富不平等导致低工资，导致高房价，并导致某些行业和世界某些地区缺乏工作岗位。

  zh: 这显然引出了一个问题——财富不平等如何才能减少？
- en: There are number of ways that Wealth Inequality could be reduced, but we can
    divide them all into one of two methods – either the very Wealthy increase their
    spending and reduce their saving (Voluntary Spending), or the government directly
    taxes their wealth (Involuntary Taxation).

  zh: 有多种方式可以减少财富不平等，但我们可以将它们分为两种方法之一——要么非常富有的人增加他们的支出并减少他们的储蓄（自愿支出），要么政府直接对他们的财富征税（强制税收）。
- en: Both methods achieve lower Wealth Inequality, but I prefer allowing the wealthy
    to spend their own money, as it is more compassionate, less extreme, less dramatic,
    and doesn’t involve state intervention.  Besides, in many cases people worked
    hard and made sacrifices to accumulate their wealth, and I don’t think it would
    be fair to punish them.

  zh: 两种方法都能降低财富不平等，但我更喜欢允许富人花自己的钱，因为这更有同情心，不那么极端，不那么戏剧化，并且不涉及国家干预。此外，在许多情况下，人们为积累财富而努力工作并做出牺牲，我认为惩罚他们是不公平的。
- en: So I think that the fairest and best way is to allow the wealthy to spend their
    own money.  But that is not happening under our current system.  The very wealthy
    spend tiny (in fact negative) proportions of their wealth within their lifetimes,
    meaning that their fortunes take on a life of their own and grow exponentially,
    sucking in the wealth of the poor all over the world.  This is what causes Wealth
    to become concentrated and just the most obvious consequence is extremely expensive
    housing, as houses are accumulated by very wealthy people who never sell them.

  zh: 所以我认为最公平和最好的方式是允许富人花自己的钱。但这在我们目前的体制下并没有发生。非常富有的人在他们一生中花费的比例微乎其微（事实上是负数），这意味着他们的财富开始自行增长，并呈指数增长，吸纳了世界各地贫困人口的财富。这就是导致财富集中化的原因，而最明显的后果之一就是极其昂贵的住房，因为房屋被非常富有的人累积，他们从不出售。
- en: The problem can actually be solved quite neatly and easily, allowing, but subtly
    forcing, the descendants of the very wealthy to spend their wealth over  the long
    term, without any resort to taxation.  We could simply place a time limit on physical
    property, the same way we place a time limit on intellectual property.

  zh: 问题实际上可以很整洁和容易地解决，允许非常富有的后代在长期内花费他们的财富，而无需诉诸税收。我们可以简单地对物理财产设定时间限制，就像我们对知识产权设定时间限制一样。
- en: As a society, we place time limits on copyrights and patents, because we don’t
    think it is fair to allow people who invent works of art or ideas to maintain
    complete economic control of them forever, long after they are dead.  If you write
    a song or a book you own it for (depending on the country) around 100 years.  If
    you invent a new drug or machine the patent (again depending on the country) lasts
    only 20 years.

  zh: 作为一个社会，我们对版权和专利设置了时间限制，因为我们不认为允许发明艺术作品或想法的人在其去世后仍然完全控制它们是公平的。如果你写了一首歌或一本书，你拥有它大约（根据国家而定）100年。如果你发明了一种新药物或机器，专利（同样根据国家而定）只有20年。
- en: This means that the creators of great works and inventions can benefit enormously
    financially, in the short term, but, in the long term, once that person is dead,soceity
    can mutually benefit from the art, inventions or ideas.  Initially, the great
    work is the property of the creator, eventually it becomes the property of us
    all.  If we allowed these ideas to stay owned forever, it would detriment us all
    as a society.  As extreme examples, we would all be paying huge chunks of our
    wages to the descendants of the original inventors of farming and metal casting.
     As a society, it doesn’t make sense to allow people’s descendants to keep ownership
    of ideas centiuries after the inventors are dead.

  zh: 这意味着伟大作品和发明的创作者在短期内可以从中获得巨大的经济利益，但是在长期内，一旦那个人去世，社会可以共同从艺术、发明或者思想中受益。最初，伟大作品是创作者的财产，最终它将成为我们所有人的财产。如果我们允许这些思想永远拥有，那么作为社会，我们所有人都会受到损害。作为极端的例子，我们都将支付我们工资的巨额部分给农业和金属铸造的原始发明者的后代。作为一个社会，允许人们的后代在发明者去世数百年后继续拥有思想的所有权是没有意义的。
- en: Interestingly, we don’t use the same logic with physical property and land.
     Even though it was given to us by the universe (or god), we allow land to be
    owned into perpetuity.  This allows land and property to be owned in a very concentrated
    fashion, in a way that we would never allow with ideas.  Indeed, much land and
    property are now owned on an inherited basis, based on what was done by now dead
    people,  many generations ago.  This concentrated ownership of now dead people’s
    land and properties causes land and property to become very expensive to the rest
    of us.

  zh: 有趣的是，我们对待物理财产和土地的逻辑并不相同。即使是宇宙（或上帝）赐予我们的，我们也允许土地永久拥有权。这使得土地和财产的拥有方式非常集中，这是我们绝不会允许在思想领域的。实际上，许多土地和财产现在是基于过去许多代人所做的事情而遗传的。这些已故人士的土地和财产的集中拥有权导致对我们其他人来说土地和财产变得非常昂贵。
- en: I propose that we could treat physical property the same way that we treat intellectual
    property.  It  is perfectly fine for people to trade and to own it, but not to
    own it forever, long after they are dead.  If one small group of people are allowed
    to own all of the land and property forever, then the majority will always be
    poor.

    very long, as long as 150 years.  Once someone is dead, they can pass their assets
    to their children, but only until that 150 year time limit is reached.  This encourages
    the very wealthy to spend, rather than save forever their assets, and involves
    no state involvement.
