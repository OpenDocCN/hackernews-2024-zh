- en: As soon as Enid Bunker saw him, she began to scream, “Oh, look who’s here! What
    a marvellous surprise! When Lucinda said that you couldn’t come, I thought I’d
    *die*. . . .” She made her way to him through the crowd, and when they had finished
    kissing, she led him to the bar, a progress that was slowed by the fact that he
    stopped to kiss eight or ten other women and shake the hands of as many men. A
    smiling bartender he had seen at a hundred parties gave him a gin-and-tonic, and
    Ned stood by the bar for a moment, anxious not to get stuck in any conversation
    that would delay his voyage. When he seemed about to be surrounded, he dove in
    and swam close to the side, to avoid colliding with Rusty’s raft. He climbed out
    at the far end of the pool, bypassed the Tomlinsons with a broad smile, and jogged
    up the garden path. The gravel cut his feet, but this was the only unpleasantness.

  zh: 伊妮德·邦克尔一见到他就开始尖叫，“哦，看看谁来了！真是个奇妙的惊喜！当琳达说你不能来时，我以为我要*死*了……”她穿过人群走向他，当他们亲吻结束时，她把他领到吧台，这一进程因为他停下来亲吻了八到十个其他女人并握了几十个男人的手而变得缓慢了。他曾在一百个派对上见过的一位面带微笑的调酒师给了他一杯金汤力，尼德站在吧台旁片刻，焦虑地不想卷入任何会延误他旅程的对话中。当他似乎即将被围困时，他迅速躲开，游到了池边，以避免与拉斯蒂的筏碰撞。他从游泳池的远端爬了出来，用宽容的微笑绕过了汤姆林森一家，小跑着走上花园小道。碎石割破了他的脚，但这是唯一的不愉快。
- en: The party was confined to the pool, and as he went toward the house he heard
    the brilliant, watery sound of voices fade, heard the noise of a radio from the
    Bunkers’ kitchen, where someone was listening to a ball game. Sunday afternoon.
    He made his way through the parked cars and down the grassy border of their driveway
    to Alewives’ Lane. He did not want to be seen on the road in his bathing trunks,
    but there was no traffic, and he made the short distance to the Levys’ driveway,
    marked with a “Private Property” sign and a green tube for the *Times*. All the
    doors and windows of the big house were open, but there were no signs of life,
    not even a barking dog. He went around the side of the house to the pool and saw
    that the Levys had only recently left. Glasses and bottles and dishes of nuts
    were on a table at the deep end, where there was a bathhouse or gazebo, hung with
    Japanese lanterns. After swimming the pool, he got himself a glass and poured
    a drink. It was his fourth or fifth drink, and he had swum nearly half the length
    of the Lucinda River. He felt tired, clean, and pleased at that moment to be alone,
    pleased with everything.

  zh: 派对只在泳池里进行，当他走向房子时，他听到了明亮而潺潺的声音逐渐消失的声音，听到了邦克尔家厨房里收音机的声音，有人正在听一场球赛。星期天下午。他穿过停放的汽车，沿着他们的车道草地边缘来到了阿勒威夫人的车道。他不想被人看到穿着泳裤在路上走，但这里没什么车辆，他很快就走到了莱维家的车道，标有“私人财产”标志和一根用于*泰晤士报*的绿色管子。大房子的所有门窗都敞开着，但没有任何生命的迹象，甚至没有一只狗在叫。他绕过房子的一侧来到了泳池边，看到莱维家刚刚离开。酒杯、酒瓶和碗碟摆放在深处的桌子上，那里有一个浴室或凉亭，挂着日本灯笼。在游完泳之后，他给自己倒了一杯酒。这已经是他第四或第五杯酒了，他几乎游过了卢辛达河的一半长度。此刻他感到疲倦、清爽，很高兴能独处，对一切都感到满意。
- en: It would storm. The stand of cumulus cloud—that city—had risen and darkened,
    and while he sat there, he heard thunder. The de Havilland trainer was still circling
    overhead, and it seemed to Ned that he could almost hear the pilot laugh with
    pleasure in the afternoon; but when there was another peal of thunder, he took
    off for home. A train whistle blew, and he wondered what time it had gotten to
    be. Four? Five? He thought of the station where, at that hour, a waiter, his tuxedo
    concealed by a raincoat, a dwarf with some flowers wrapped in newspaper, and a
    woman who had been crying would be waiting for the local. It was suddenly growing
    dark—it was that moment when the pinheaded birds seem to organize their song into
    some acute and knowledgeable recognition of the storm’s approach. From the crown
    of an oak at his back, there was a fine noise of rushing water, as if a spigot
    there had been turned on. Then the noise of fountains came from the crowns of
    all the tall trees. Why did he love storms? What was the meaning of his excitement
    when the front door sprang open and the rain wind fled rudely up the stairs? Why
    had the simple task of shutting the windows of an old house seemed fitting and
    urgent? Why did the first watery notes of a storm wind have for him the unmistakable
    sound of good news, cheer, glad tidings? There was an explosion, a smell of cordite,
    and rain lashed the Japanese lanterns that Mrs. Levy had bought in Kyoto the year
    before last, or was it the year before that?

  zh: 大雨将要来临。 积雨云堆积如城市一般升起并变黑，而当他坐在那里时，他听到了雷声。 德哈维兰教练机仍在头顶盘旋，Ned觉得他几乎能听到飞行员在下午愉快地笑声；
    但当雷声再次响起时，他就朝着家里飞驰而去。 一声火车汽笛响起，他想知道现在是几点了。 四点？ 五点？ 他想起了车站，在那个时候，一个穿着雨衣藏起了礼服的服务员，一个用报纸包着一些花的侏儒，以及一个一直在哭泣的女人会在等待当地火车。
    天突然变黑了—就在那时，像针头一样的鸟类似乎将他们的歌声组织成对风暴来临的敏锐而知识丰富的认识。 从他背后一棵橡树的冠部传来一阵急促的水声，仿佛那里的水龙头已经被打开了。
    然后，所有高大树木的冠部都传来喷泉的声音。 他为什么喜欢风暴？ 当前门突然打开，雨风粗暴地冲上楼梯时，他的兴奋意味着什么？ 为什么关闭一座旧房子的窗户的简单任务似乎合适而迫切？
    为什么风暴风的第一滴水音对他来说有着无法置疑的好消息、欢呼、喜讯的声音？ 一声爆炸，硝烟味飘起，雨打着Mrs. Levy两年前在京都买的日式灯笼，还是前年买的？
- en: He stayed in the Levys’ gazebo until the storm had passed. The rain had cooled
    the air and he shivered. The force of the wind had stripped a maple of its red
    and yellow leaves and scattered them over the grass and the water. Since it was
    midsummer, the tree must be blighted, and yet he felt a sadness at this sign of
    autumn. He braced his shoulders, emptied his glass, and started for the Welchers’
    pool. This meant crossing the Pasterns’ riding ring, and he was surprised to find
    it overgrown with grass and all the jumps dismantled. Had the Pasterns sold their
    horses or gone away for the summer and put them out to board? He seemed to remember
    having heard something about the Pasterns and their horses, but the memory was
    unclear. On he went, barefoot, through the wet grass to the Welchers’, where he
    found that their pool was dry.

  zh: 他待在Levys的凉亭里，直到风暴过去。 雨水降温了空气，他打了个寒战。 风的力量剥夺了一棵枫树的红黄叶，将它们散落在草地和水面上。 由于是仲夏，树肯定受了害，但他对秋天的迹象感到悲伤。
    他挺直肩膀，喝干了杯中的酒，然后向Welchers的泳池走去。 这意味着要穿过Pasterns的骑马场，他惊讶地发现草地长满了草，所有的跳跃都拆除了。 Pasterns是不是把马卖了，或者他们夏天离开了，把它们放出去寄养了？
    他似乎记得曾经听说过Pasterns和他们的马的事情，但记忆不清。 他赤脚踏着湿草向Welchers走去，在那里他发现他们的泳池干了。
- en: This breach in his chain of water disappointed him absurdly, and he felt like
    an explorer who is seeking a torrential headwater and finds a dead stream. He
    was disappointed and mystified. It was common enough to go away for the summer,
    but people never drained their pools. The Welchers had definitely gone away. The
    pool furniture was folded, stacked, and covered with a tarpaulin. The bathhouse
    was locked. All the windows of the house were shut, and when he went around to
    the driveway in front, he saw a “For Sale” sign nailed to a tree. When had he
    last heard from the Welchers—when, that is, had he and Lucinda last regretted
    an invitation to dine with them? It seemed only a week or so ago. Was his memory
    failing, or had he so disciplined it in the repression of unpleasant facts that
    he had damaged his sense of the truth? In the distance he heard the sound of a
    tennis game. This cheered him, cleared away all his apprehensions, and let him
    regard the overcast sky and the cold air with indifference. This was the day that
    Neddy Merrill swam across the county. That was the day! He started off then for
    his most difficult portage.

  zh: 他链子中断的这一瞬间令他荒谬地失望，他感觉自己就像一个正在寻找湍急源头却发现了一条死水的探险家。他感到失望和困惑。离开整个夏天很常见，但人们从不排干游泳池。韦尔切一家明显已经离开了。游泳池家具已经叠放整齐，并用篷布覆盖着。浴室被锁上了。房子的所有窗户都关着，当他走到前面的车道时，他看到一块“待售”牌钉在一棵树上。他上次何时听到过韦尔切一家的消息——也就是说，他和卢辛达上次是什么时候后悔没能接受他们的邀请一起用餐呢？好像只是一周前。是他的记忆出了问题，还是他过分压制不愉快的事实以至于破坏了自己的真实感？远处传来了网球比赛的声音。这让他振奋起来，消除了所有的忧虑，让他漠视起阴天和寒冷的空气。这就是内迪·梅里尔穿越县的那一天。那一天！于是，他踏上了最艰难的渡口之旅。
- en: Had you gone for a Sunday-afternoon ride that day, you might have seen him,
    close to naked, standing on the shoulder of Route 424, waiting for a chance to
    cross. You might have wondered if he was the victim of foul play, or had his car
    broken down, or was he merely a fool? Standing barefoot in the deposits of the
    highway beer cans, rags, and blowout patches, exposed to all kinds of ridicule,
    he seemed pitiful. He had known when he started that this was a part of his journey—it
    had been on his imaginary maps—but, confronted with the lines of traffic worming
    through the summery light, he found himself unprepared. He was laughed at, jeered
    at, a beer can was thrown at him, and he had no dignity or humor to bring to the
    situation. He could have gone back, back to the Westerhazys’, where Lucinda would
    still be sitting in the sun. He had signed nothing, vowed nothing, pledged nothing—not
    even to himself. Why, believing as he did that all human obduracy was susceptible
    to common sense, was he unable to turn back? Why was he determined to complete
    his journey, even if it meant putting his life in danger? At what point had this
    prank, this joke, this piece of horseplay become serious? He could not go back,
    he could not even recall with any clearness the green water at the Westerhazys’,
    the sense of inhaling the day’s components, the friendly and relaxed voices saying
    that they had *drunk* too much. In the space of an hour, more or less, he had
    covered a distance that made his return impossible.

- en: An old man, tooling down the highway at fifteen miles an hour, let him get to
    the middle of the road, where there was a grass divider. Here he was exposed to
    the ridicule of the northbound traffic, but after ten or fifteen minutes he was
    able to cross. From here he had only a short walk to the Recreation Center at
    the edge of the village of Lancaster, where there were some handball courts and

- en: 'The effect of water on voices, the illusion of brilliance and suspense, was
    the same here as it had been at the Bunkers’, but the sounds here were louder,
    harsher, and more shrill, and as soon as he entered the crowded enclosure he was
    confronted with regimentation. “*ALL SWIMMERS MUST TAKE A SHOWER BEFORE USING
    THE POOL. ALL SWIMMERS MUST USE THE FOOT-BATH. ALL SWIMMERS MUST WEAR THEIR IDENTIFICATION
    DISCS*.” He took a shower, washed his feet in a cloudy and bitter solution, and
    made his way to the edge of the water. It stank of chlorine and looked to him
    like a sink. A pair of lifeguards in a pair of towers blew police whistles at
    what seemed to be regular intervals, and abused the swimmers through a public-address
    system. Neddy remembered the sapphire water at the Bunkers’ with longing, and
    thought that he might contaminate himself—damage his own prosperousness and charm—by
    swimming in this murk, but he reminded himself that he was an explorer, a pilgrim,
    and that this was merely a stagnant bend in the Lucinda River. He dove, scowling
    with distaste, into the chlorine, and had to swim with his head above water to
    avoid collisions, but even so he was bumped into, splashed, and jostled. When
    he got to the shallow end, both lifeguards were shouting at him: “Hey, you, you
    without the identification disc, get outa the water!” He did. They had no way
    of pursuing him, and he went through the reek of sun-tan oil and chlorine, out
    through the hurricane fence and past the handball courts. Crossing the road, he
    entered the wooded part of the Halloran estate. The woods were not cleared, and
    the footing was treacherous and difficult, until he reached the lawn and the clipped
    beech hedge that encircled the pool.'

    to bask in the suspicion that they might be Communists. They were zealous reformers,
    but they were not Communists, and yet when they were accused, as they sometimes
    were, of subversion, it seemed to gratify and excite them. Their beech hedge was
    yellow, and he guessed it was suffering from a blight, like the Levys’ maple.
    He called “Hullo, hullo,” to warn the Hallorans of his approach. The Hallorans,
    for reasons that had never been explained to him, did not wear bathing suits.
    No explanations were in order, really. Their nakedness was a detail in their uncompromising
