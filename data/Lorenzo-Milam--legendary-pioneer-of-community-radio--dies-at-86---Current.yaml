    of KPFA that in 1958 he tried to start a Pacifica-like station himself in Washington,
    D.C. When that didn’t work out because the FCC was fearful of a Pacifica voice
    in our nation’s capital, he fled to Seattle. There he was able to fulfill his

    KRAB went on the air in 1963 and was the first non-Pacifica station to offer a
    really broad and quirky range of voices, music and culture over the airwaves.

    growing opposition to the war in Vietnam, and the revolution in norms that brought
    about the counterculture and Woodstock Nation. So while CPB, created in 1967,
