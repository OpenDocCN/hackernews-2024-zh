- en: We’ve reported on a technology called pulsed plasma rockets (PPRs) here at UT
    a few times. Several research groups have worked on variations of them. They are
    so popular partly because of their extremely high specific impulse and thrust
    levels, and they seemingly solve the trade-off between those two all-important
    variables in space exploration propulsion systems. Essentially, they are an extremely
    efficient propulsion methodology that, if scaled up, would allow payloads to reach
    other planets in weeks rather than months or years. However, some inherent dangers
    still need to be worked out, and overcoming some of those dangers was the purpose
    of a NASA Institute for Advanced Concepts (NIAC) project back in 2020.

    NIAC grants (including two in 2020 itself), the purpose of this project was to
    model the design of a fully functional PPR in modeling software to see if the
    necessary materials and power systems are available for a rocket that can provide
    100 kN of thrust and over 5,000 seconds of specific impulse.

- en: In essence, a PPR takes a fuel pellet made out of some form of fissionable material
    (in this case, uranium), and zaps it into a plasma, then emits the plasma out
    the back for a forceful thrust. Rockets with this design can carry much less fuel
    than standard chemical rockets, but their design must be significantly larger
    due to the heating constraints put on the system by creating the plasma in the
    first place.

    is released into to see if it could withstand the extreme temperatures created
    by handling a plasmatized uranium pellet.

- en: To do this modeling, the team at Howe Industries used a modeling software called
    MCNP6 to check where particles went in the system and thereby calculate how much
    heat would be collected on other parts of the system where it wasn’t desired.
    MCNP6 uses a Monte Carlo simulation methodology, which calculates where neutrons
    will be created from the fission reaction that makes the plasma and where those
    neutrons will impact the rest of the spacecraft.

- en: Those plasmas would have to be created about once every second, according to
    the calculations done by Howe Industries, and each pulse must reach an energy
    level of around 1 keV – much smaller than industrial-level nuclear fission reactors
    but a relatively high number for a spacecraft propulsion system. That energy is
    turned into heat, and while some of the heat is effectively used to eject the
    plasmatized uranium out as a thrust propellant, the rest is absorbed by other
    parts of the system.

  zh: 根据豪威工业的计算，这些等离子体每秒钟需要创建一次，每个脉冲必须达到约1 keV的能量水平——远低于工业级核裂变反应堆，但对于航天器推进系统来说是一个相对较高的数值。这些能量转化为热能，虽然一些热能有效地用于将等离子化铀排出作为推进剂，但其余部分被系统的其他部分吸收。

- en: The barrel was a part of that system that is particularly important in these
    thermal calculations. The modeled barrel was made out of low-enriched uranium
    but of a different type than the projectile, allowing the energy to heat the projectile
    and not the barrel itself. However, a small part of the barrel would be made of
    highly enriched uranium, allowing for rapid plasma propagation in an otherwise
    relatively stable system.

  zh: 这个桶在热计算中是系统中特别重要的一部分。建模的桶由低浓缩铀制成，但与弹丸不同，允许能量加热弹丸而不是桶本身。然而，桶的一小部分将由高浓缩铀制成，允许在一个相对稳定的系统中快速传播等离子体。
- en: That’s not to say that none of the heat generated by the fission reaction would
    end up in the barrel. Still, by the author’s calculations as part of their final
    report, an active cooling system should be enough to lower the temperature to
    a point where at least the barrel itself wouldn’t melt. Other parts of the system,
    such as the nozzle and a rotating drum that helps handle the fuel pellet, will
    be modeled in future work.

  zh: 这并不意味着裂变反应产生的所有热量都不会进入桶内。尽管如此，根据作者的计算作为最终报告的一部分，一个主动冷却系统应该足以将温度降低到至少不会使桶本身熔化的程度。系统的其他部分，如喷嘴和帮助处理燃料小球的旋转滚筒，将在未来的工作中进行建模。
- en: Additional future work would include building benchtop prototypes of these systems
    to test them out, though the prospect of working with highly enriched uranium
    as part of this process seems daunting. However, NIAC hasn’t yet funded a Phase
    II study of the PPR system, so for now, it is resigned to a nicely modeled project
    and another step forward in an idea that has plenty of history. Maybe someday,
    it will find its time to shine.
