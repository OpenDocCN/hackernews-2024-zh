    "no citation for a moving violation can be issued if the [autonomous vehicle]

- en: Self-driving cars can receive parking tickets, but get off scot-free for violations
    while in motion if no driver is behind the wheel. In 2018 a test driver operating
    a Cruise car in self-driving mode was ticketed when the vehicle failed to yield
    to a pedestrian at a crosswalk. But traffic crimes committed by driverless vehicles
    can go unpunished since citations can only be issued to humans who were at the
    wheel.

  zh: 无人驾驶汽车可以收到停车罚单，但如果没有司机坐在车轮后面，它在行驶过程中的违规行为将免于惩罚。2018年，一名在自动驾驶模式下操作Cruise汽车的测试驾驶员，当车辆未能礼让过行人时被罚款。但由于只能对坐在车轮后的人开具罚单，无人驾驶汽车犯下的交通违法行为可能不会受到惩处。

    operators liable for violating driving rules. Texas will fine the owners of autonomous
    vehicles if the technology breaks traffic laws regardless of whether a person
