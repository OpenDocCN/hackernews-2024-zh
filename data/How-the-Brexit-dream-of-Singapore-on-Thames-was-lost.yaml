- en: According to Liz Truss, the former prime minister, it’s all down to the “deep
    state”, a suffocating conspiracy of bureaucrats and quangos that is determined
    to thwart the noble ambitions of elected politicians such as herself. Truss, by
    the way, campaigned for Remain, but then there is no zealot quite like the convert.

  zh: 根据前首相利兹·特拉斯的说法，这一切都归咎于“深层国家”，即官僚和半官方机构的阴谋，他们决心阻挠她等选举政客的崇高雄心。顺便说一句，特拉斯曾经支持留欧，但转变后没有比她更狂热的改变者了。
- en: There may be some element of truth in what she says about Whitehall obstinacy
    and the shortcomings of [non elected technocrats](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2024/02/21/civil-service-union-shorter-week-same-pay/),
    but her take on events is essentially just a lot of paranoid nonsense straight
    out of the populist playbook, where an imaginary “enemy within” is created as
    a hate plank to channel the discontents of voters.

- en: It was up to Brexit’s political cheerleaders to make something out of Britain’s
    decision to leave the European Union, whatever the obstacles, but they failed.
    They over promised and under delivered, and the presiding government is now about
    to reap the whirlwind.

  zh: 脱欧的政治支持者本应从英国决定脱离欧盟中获取一些成就，无论面临多少困难，但他们失败了。他们过度承诺，履行不到位，现任政府即将因此付出代价。
- en: This was not because the bureaucrats betrayed them, or even the rather more
    credible excuse of the pandemic; it was because the vision of Singapore-on-Thames

    crisis that erupted, because she had in fact dispensed with its services. Markets
    drew the obvious conclusion – that the OBR would never have weathered her fiscal
