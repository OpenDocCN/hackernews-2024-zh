    and proliferating through nature, while nanoplastics (pieces less than a micron,
    or 0.001 mm) have been difficult to accurately measure. This is where boffins

- en: Using a technique dubbed stimulated Raman scattering (SRS), the academics discovered
    an average of 240,000 plastic particles per litre of bottled water across three
    of the brands tested, with measurements ranging from 110,000 to 370,000 fragments
    per litre. This is, we're told, 10 to 100 times greater than earlier estimates.
    Around 90 percent of the particles detected using SRS qualified as nanoplastics,
    the rest being microplastics.

    present in water can help find sources of microplastic contamination. PET and
    PE, both commonly used in the plastic bottles used to hold water, were, as noted,
    found in the samples. Other polymers were also found in the bottles, but aren't
    part of the packaging process, hence a likely contamination source "before or
