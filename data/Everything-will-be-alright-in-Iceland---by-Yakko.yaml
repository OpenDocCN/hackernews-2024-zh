  zh: 你从每个你居住过的地方学到了什么？那里的人们做什么事情你认为可以应用到其他地方？

    Just about every Icelandic person has been on a hike, and they all seem to have
    a level of admiration and care for nature that's not as widespread elsewhere.

  zh: 对于冰岛，我相信我提到了人们与大自然的联系。几乎每个冰岛人都曾参加过徒步旅行，他们似乎都对大自然有一种敬仰和关怀，这在其他地方并不如此普遍。

  zh: 但考虑到最近的火山喷发，我开始思考另一件事。
- en: There's a saying in Icelandic - *þetta reddast* - that means "everything will
    be alright", and, while many languages have a similar expression, this one is
    really embedded in Icelandic culture.

  zh: 冰岛有句谚语 - *þetta reddast* - 意思是“一切都会好的”，虽然许多语言都有类似的表达，但这个表达真正深入了冰岛文化。

    there. I was reasonably worried, and started remembering things I'd seen as a

  zh: 我记得我生活在那里时第一次感受到地震的时候，我当时相当担心，开始回忆我小时候看到的事情。
- en: '"*Should we get under a table?*" — I asked my Icelandic girlfriend at the time.
    She didn''t seem too phased, and before she had a chance to answer, the quake
    stopped. "*Well, I guess it''s all good now*".'

  zh: “*我们应该躲到桌子下吗？*” ——我问当时的冰岛女友。她似乎并不太担心，在她有机会回答之前，地震停了下来。“*嗯，我想现在一切都好了*”。
- en: There was also the time when I was convinced to “walk up” (turns out it was
    actually climb up) one of the ice pinnacles atop of Snaefellsjökull. At the time
    I had no experience with crampons or an ice axe at all, yet the group of also
    amateurs from my ex-girlfriend's company were all pretty chill about the situation
    and pitched it as a seemingly easy thing.

  zh: 还有一次，我被说服“爬上”（结果实际上是爬上）了Snaefellsjökull顶上的一个冰尖。当时我完全没有使用冰爪或冰斧的经验，然而我前女友公司的一群业余爱好者似乎对这种情况都很冷静，并把它描述成一件看起来很容易的事情。
- en: On the way up there, quite a few of the people got scared, and I for one nearly
    lost my oversized crampon, which came off my foot and caused me to slide down
    this steep ice slope that led straight into a crevasse at the bottom. I managed
    to stop myself with an ice axe self-arrest, saved by having used my free time
    in the past to watch alpinism videos with self-arrest tutorials.

  zh: 在去那里的路上，相当多的人都吓坏了，而我几乎失去了我那双过大的冰爪，它从我的脚上掉了下来，导致我滑下了这个陡峭的冰坡，直接滑进了底部的一个冰裂缝。我设法用冰斧自救，幸运的是我过去利用空闲时间观看了自救教程的登山视频。

  zh: 问题在于生活在冰岛需要一种独特的心态，即使冰岛人自己并不一定会经常考虑这一点。

    a mix of belief that everything will be okay, but also determination and preparedness

  zh: 要生活在一个火山顶上或附近有一个巨大的火山，需要一种相信一切都会好的信念，但同时也需要决心和准备让一切如此。

  zh: 从某种意义上说，你几乎需要愿意重新开始。
- en: Before I lived there, the first time I visited Iceland I stayed in this farmer's
    cabin in the South, and he told us about how despite him being okay and his house
    staying up, he lost all of his sheep due to the ash from the 2010 Eyjafjallajökull
    eruption.

  zh: 我和法格拉达尔斯菲亚火山（也许太近了）的背景。
- en: The Fagradalsfjall eruption in 2021, which happened while I was still living
    there, marked the end of around 800 years of no volcanic activity in the Reykjanes
    peninsula, an area of significant economic importance that's also dangerously
    close to where the vast majority of Icelanders live - the Reykjavík capital region.

  zh: 2021 年法格拉达尔斯菲亚火山喷发发生在我还住在那里的时候，标志着雷克雅内斯半岛约 800 年没有火山活动的结束，这个地区具有重要的经济意义，但却与大多数冰岛人生活的地方——雷克雅未克首都地区——危险地接近。
- en: But having some of the world's best geologists and volcanologists in the world,
    a well-trained Search & Rescue team, and a conscious population means Iceland
    feels ready to deal with this, and that everything will be okay.

  zh: 但是，拥有世界上最优秀的地质学家和火山学家之一，一支训练有素的搜索与救援队伍，以及一个有意识的人口意味着冰岛感觉已经准备好应对这一切，一切都会没事的。
- en: You see this from how fast Grindavík, a town potentially in danger, was evacuated
    ahead of this 2023 eruption, an event somewhat analogous to the heroic effort
    of the Heimaey evacuation in 1973, where an entire island was evacuated in just
    a few hours after the alarm sounded for a surprise eruption. Plus they also managed
    to save the harbor, by pumping seawater and spraying it into the lava to redirect
    it.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 你可以从 2023 年爆发前格林达维克（一个潜在危险的城镇）的疏散速度中看到这一点，这一事件在某种程度上类似于 1973 年海梅岛撤离的英勇努力，当时在警报响起后仅几小时内就疏散了整个岛屿以应对突如其来的火山喷发。此外，他们还通过泵海水并将其喷洒到熔岩上来挽救了港口。
- en: I say all this to say that Icelanders are possibly better prepared than most
    of us to deal with life.

  zh: 我说这些是为了说明冰岛人可能比我们大多数人更有准备来面对生活。

    only in their little island.
