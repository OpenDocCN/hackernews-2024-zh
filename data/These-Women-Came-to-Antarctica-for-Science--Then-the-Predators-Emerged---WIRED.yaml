- en: On April 12, 2019, Boston University finally fired David Marchant for sexually
    harassing Willenbring. (The university said it could not corroborate her claims
    of physical and psychological abuse.) Marchant released a statement, which the
    journal *Science* quoted as vowing that he had “never” sexually harassed anyone,
    “not in 1998 or 1999 in Antarctica or at any time since.” But because of Willenbring,
    the word was out.

  zh: 2019年4月12日，波士顿大学最终因对威伦布林的性骚扰开除了大卫·马尔钦特。（大学表示无法证实她关于身体和心理虐待的声明。）马尔钦特发表了一份声明，科学杂志引用其中誓言称他“从未”对任何人实施性骚扰，“不论是1998年还是1999年在南极或者任何时候之后。”但由于威伦布林，事情曝光了。
- en: Reeling in the wake of this scandal, the National Science Foundation commissioned
    an outside study on sexual assault and sexual harassment at the Antarctic research
    facilities. The lengthy report, made public in August 2022, had shocking allegations
    of assault, stalking, and harassment. Britt Barquist, the former fuel foreman,
    was on contract at McMurdo with a company now called Amentum. She oversaw a crew
    of about 20 who did the dangerous work of handling and cleaning diesel and gasoline
    fuel tanks. One day in late November 2017, she tells me, she was sitting at a
    table alongside a man who held a senior position at Leidos, the company managing
    the Antarctic research stations. He’d been running a briefing for the staff when
    he groped her in plain view.

  zh: 在这场丑闻的余波中，美国国家科学基金会委托外部进行了一项关于南极研究设施性侵和性骚扰的研究。这份长篇报告于2022年8月公开，其中包含了关于性侵、跟踪和骚扰的令人震惊的指控。布里特·巴奎斯特，前燃料管理员，在现在称为阿门特姆的公司在麦克默多签约。她负责管理约20人的团队，进行处理和清洁柴油和汽油储罐等危险工作。她告诉我，2017年11月底的一天，她坐在一个在管理南极研究站的莱多斯公司的高级职位的男子旁边。他在为员工进行简报时，在众目睽睽之下对她进行了触摸。
- en: When she talked about it with her supervisor, he said he’d witnessed some of
    the incident himself. His boss reported it to the human resources department at
    Amentum. “I told HR that I don’t want to be anywhere around him ever again. I
    am scared of this person,” Barquist says, “And they said, ‘OK.’”

- en: But in 2020, during another stint working with the McMurdo contractor, she was
    told she’d be attending weekly virtual meetings with that same senior official.
    Barquist, who needed the job, downplayed it to herself. “It was just disgusting
    and awful to have to look at his face and listen to him talk,” she says, “just
    to see him treated as a normal guy, when in my head I’m like, ‘This guy is a predator.
    Why is everyone just acting like he’s some normal person?’”

  zh: 但是在2020年，在与麦克默多承包商的另一次工作期间，她被告知将参加与同一位高级官员的每周虚拟会议。巴奎斯特，需要这份工作，对自己进行了淡化。“不得不看着他的脸和听他说话，真是令人恶心和可怕，”她说，“只是看着他被当作普通人对待，而在我的脑海中，我想‘这个家伙是个捕食者。为什么每个人都表现得像他是个普通人一样？’”
- en: The next year, toward the end of nearly three weeks of Covid quarantine with
    a crew in New Zealand, she’d scanned the manifest for an upcoming flight to Antarctica
    and saw the senior official’s name on it. When she called her HR department over
    a spotty connection to complain, she says she was met with obstinance by two officials,
    one of whom had been introduced as a victim’s advocate.

  zh: 第二年，隔离期间，与一组在新西兰的船员接近三周的结束，她查看了即将飞往南极的航班名单，并看到了一位高级官员的名字。当她因连接不稳打电话给人力资源部门投诉时，她说，遭遇到两名官员的顽固态度，其中一名曾被介绍为受害者的辩护人。
- en: “I said I still don’t want to be around this guy,” she tells me, “but they said,
    ‘So how do you suggest we deal with this?’” Barquist gets emotional as she recalls
    her conversation with the two women from her employer. “I thought they were going
    to be on my side,” she says. Instead, they kept pressing her as to how afraid
    she felt to be around him.

  zh: “我说我依然不想在这个人身边，”她告诉我，“但他们说，‘那么你建议我们如何处理？’”回想起她与雇主的两名女性的对话时，巴奎斯特情绪激动。“我以为他们会站在我的一边，”她说。相反，他们不断追问她围绕这个人感到多么害怕。
- en: “I finally was like, ‘Yes,’” she says, “‘I feel unsafe being alone in a room
    with him!’” Then the signal dropped, she says, and she never managed to reconnect
    with them. Barquist flew back to Antarctica, where she tried to avoid the senior
    official. But as her team’s safety depended on her communicating with him on a
    nearly daily basis, she eventually relented.

  zh: “最后我终于说，‘是的’，”她说，“‘我觉得一个人和他在房间里很不安全！’” 然后信号断了，她说，她再也没有重新连接上他们。巴奎斯特飞回南极洲，她试图避开这位高级官员。但由于她团队的安全取决于她几乎每天都与他沟通，最终她还是屈服了。
