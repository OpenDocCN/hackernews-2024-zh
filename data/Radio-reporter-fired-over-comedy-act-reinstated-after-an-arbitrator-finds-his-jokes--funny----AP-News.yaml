  zh: 34 岁的 Jad Sleiman 将完全恢复到他在 WHYY 的职位上，这是一家位于费城的 NPR 电台，仲裁员确定，尽管在社交媒体上发布的片段可能被解释为“煽动性”，但该机构在解雇他的决定中“仓促行事”。

- en: Officials at WHYY argued that his standup comedy violated the company’s code
    of conduct, social media guidelines and values of social responsibility, finding
    his routine to be “inflammatory.” They submitted nine videos from social media
    as their evidence. They argued the clips were “‘egregious’ in content, and had
    ‘sexual connotations, racial connotations, and misogynistic information,’ ” according
    to the arbitration documents.

    2013 after serving in the U.S. Marine Corps, argued in arbitration his stand-up
    routines stem from his experiences as an Arab American raised in a Muslim family,
    and his time in military service and reporting in the Middle East.

    expression, of course you should get fired for that,’ ” he said. “But I hate that

    Agreement that I am required to apply,” he wrote — he also found them to be sometimes

    also asked to delete any “offensive post-discharge” posts where he disparaged
    the company for his firing. (Coburn found that, “under the circumstances, such
    ‘foolishness’ does not disqualify him from reinstatement.”)

- en: 'Sleiman first turned to comedy in 2021, after he was diagnosed with multiple
    sclerosis, a chronic illness that affects the central nervous system. One of his
    biggest fears, he said, was losing fine motor function and, with it, his ability
    to play the guitar and piano. But stand-up was a safe spot: There’s a stool if
    he needs to sit down, a mic stand if he can’t hold the microphone.'
