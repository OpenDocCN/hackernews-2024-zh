- en: Something is "robustly tolerable" if it performs adequately under a wide range
    of circumstances. Robustly tolerable things have decent insulation against negative
    shocks. A car with excellent safety features but a low top speed is robustly tolerable.
    A fast but dangerous sports car is not.

  zh: 如果某物在广泛的情况下表现良好，它就是"稳健可容忍"的。稳健可容忍的事物对负面冲击有良好的防护。一辆具有出色安全功能但最高速度较低的汽车是稳健可容忍的。而快速但危险的跑车则不是。
- en: We often have to pay a price to make something more robustly tolerable. Sometimes
    we need to trade off performance. If I can only perform an amazing gymnastics
    routine 10% of the time, it might be better for me to opt for a less amazing routine
    that I can get right 90% of the time. Sometimes we need to trade off agility.
    If a large company develops checks on their decision-making processes over time,
    this may make their decisions more robustly tolerable but reduce the speed at
    which they can make those decisions.

  zh: 我们通常需要付出代价才能使某物更加稳健可容忍。有时我们需要在性能和稳健性之间做出权衡。如果我只能完成一个惊人的体操动作10%的时间，也许选择一个不那么惊人但我能成功90%的动作可能更好。有时我们需要在灵活性和稳健性之间做出权衡。如果一家大公司随着时间发展在其决策过程中引入了制衡措施，这可能会使得他们的决策更加稳健，但降低了决策速度。
- en: Being robustly tolerable is not a particularly valuable trait when the expected
    costs of failure are low, but it's an extremely valuable trait when the expected
    costs of failure are high. The more high impact something is—the more widely a
    technology is used or the more important a piece of infrastructure is, for example—the
    more we want it to be robustly tolerable. When a lot is on the line, we're more
    likely to opt for a product that is worse most of the time but has fewer critical
    failures.

  zh: 当预期失败成本低时，稳健可容忍并不是一个特别有价值的特征，但是当预期失败成本高时，它则是一个极其有价值的特征。某物的影响越大——例如技术的广泛应用或基础设施的重要性越高——我们就越希望它具备稳健可容忍性。当风险极大时，我们更倾向于选择大部分时间表现较差但关键失败较少的产品。
- en: What are examples where the expected costs of failure are high? It's clearly
    very bad if an entire country is suddenly governed poorly. The costs of total
    failures of governance have historically been very high. This is why being robustly
    tolerable is a very desirable feature of large-scale governance structures. If
    your country is already functioning adequately with democractic elections, term
    limits, a careful legislative process, and checks on power—several branches of
    government, an independent judiciary, a free press, laws against corruption, and
    so on—then it seems less likely to suddenly be plunged into an authoritarian dictatorship
    or to experience political catastrophes like hyperinflation or famine.

  zh: 在哪些情况下预期失败成本很高？如果一个国家突然治理不善，显然是非常糟糕的。治理彻底失败的成本在历史上一直非常高昂。这就是为什么大规模治理结构具备稳健可容忍特性非常可取的原因。如果你的国家已经通过民主选举、任期限制、谨慎的立法程序以及对权力的制衡——包括多个政府部门、独立的司法机构、自由的新闻媒体、反腐败法律等——正常运转，那么突然陷入威权独裁或经历像超级通胀或饥荒这样的政治灾难的可能性似乎较小。
- en: I think we can undervalue the property of being robustly tolerable. When we
    see something that is robustly tolerable, sometimes all we see is a thing that
    could clearly perform better. (The car could go faster, the decision-making process
    could be less burdensome, etc.) We don't take into account the fact that—even
    if the thing never behaves optimally—it's also less likely to do something terrible.
    How well something functions often is in plain sight. But the downside risk isn't
    visible most of the time, so it's easy to forget to look at how robust its performance
    is. Overlooking robustness could be especially harmful if the only way to improve
    something's performance involves making it less robust.

  zh: 我认为我们可能低估了稳健可容忍的重要性。当我们看到某物是稳健可容忍的时候，有时我们只看到一个显然可以表现得更好的东西。（汽车可以开得更快，决策过程可以更少繁琐等。）我们没有考虑到这样一个事实——即使该物体从未达到最佳表现，它也更不太可能做出可怕的事情。某物的功能有时是显而易见的。但是大部分时间看不到下降风险，所以很容易忘记查看其稳健表现。如果改善某物的性能唯一途径是使其不那么稳健，那么忽视稳健性可能尤为有害。
- en: For example, if a candidate we dislike gets elected, it can be tempting to blame
    the democratic process that allowed it to happen. People can even claim that it
    would be better to have less democracy than to have people elect such bad representatives.
    But the very same democratic process often limits the power of that individual
    and lets people vote them out. A benevolent dictatorship may seem surprisingly
    alluring in bad times, but any political system that enables a benevolent dictatorship
    also puts you at much greater risk of a malevolent one. (As an aside, I find it
    a bit odd when people's reaction to "bad decisions by the electorate" is to give
    up on democracy rather than, say, trying to build a more educated and informed
    electorate.)

  zh: 例如，如果我们不喜欢的候选人当选了，会很容易责怪允许这种情况发生的民主进程。人们甚至可以声称，与其让人们选出这样糟糕的代表，不如减少民主的程度更好。但同样的民主进程通常限制了个人的权力，并允许人们投票将其赶下台。在困难时期，仁慈的独裁统治可能看起来非常诱人，但任何使仁慈独裁成为可能的政治体制也会让你面临更大的恶意风险。（顺便说一句，当人们对“选民的糟糕决策”反应是放弃民主而不是试图建立一个更有教育和信息的选民时，我觉得有点奇怪。）
- en: Actions and plans can also vary in how robustly tolerable they are. Risk-taking
    behaviors like starting a company are generally less robustly tolerable, while
    lower-variance plans, e.g. getting a medical degree, are more robustly tolerable.
    In line with what I noted in [a previous post](https://askell.io/posts/2020/06/optimal-failure?ref=askell.blog),
    we should generally be in favor of robustly tolerable actions and plans when the
    expected cost of failure is high, and in favor of more fragile but high-yield
    behaviors and plans when the expected cost of failure is low.

  zh: 行动和计划在强壮地可容忍程度上也有所不同。像创办公司这样的冒险行为通常不太强壮地可容忍，而低方差的计划，比如获得医学学位，就更为强壮地可容忍。与我在[之前的一篇文章](https://askell.io/posts/2020/06/optimal-failure?ref=askell.blog)中指出的一致，当失败成本预期较高时，我们通常应支持强壮地可容忍的行动和计划；当失败成本预期较低时，我们应支持更为脆弱但高产出的行为和计划。
- en: Being robustly tolerable is not always a virtue worth having more of. We can
    tip the balance between too far in favor of robustness, and we can sacrifice too
    much performance or agility in order to achieve it. If we do, we can find ourselves
    in a robust mediocrity that it's difficult to get out of. (You may believe that
    some of the examples I give above are robustly mediocre rather than robustly tolerable.)

  zh: 强壮地可容忍并不总是一个值得拥有更多的优点。我们可以在偏向过多的强壮性之间找到平衡，我们可以为了达到这一点而牺牲太多的性能或灵活性。如果我们这样做，我们可能会陷入难以摆脱的强壮平庸之中。（你可能认为我上面给出的一些例子是强壮地平庸而不是强壮地可容忍。）
- en: But if something is robustly tolerable then the worst case scenarios are less
    likely and less harmful. This is a valuable trait to have in domains where the
    cost of failure is high. It's also a trait that's easy to overlook if we focus
    exclusively on how well something is performing in the here and now, and forget
    to consider how well it performs in the worst case scenario.
