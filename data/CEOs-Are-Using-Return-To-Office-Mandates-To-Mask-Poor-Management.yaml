- en: At the onset of the pandemic, we found ourselves at a pivotal crossroads that
    compelled us to reimagine how we work. This shift was as profound as it was inevitable,
    marking our turn towards a new direction in reshaping the essence of our ways
    of working. Work from home has now stabilized at ~30% in the U.S. as of December
    2023, which is almost four times pre-pandemic levels, according to a recent paper
    from the [American Economic Association](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257%2Fjep.37.4.23

    2023 年 12 月，美国的远程办公现已稳定在约 30% 的水平，几乎是疫情前水平的四倍，根据[美国经济学会](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257%2Fjep.37.4.23

    their operational cost structures and redefine new ways of working. Companies
    are now navigating a landscape that oscillates between in-person, fully remote,

    "https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4675401"), compelling evidence
    suggests that organizations are leveraging Return-To-Office mandates not to enhance
    firm value, but rather to reassert control and shift blame for poor performance
    onto employees. Contrary to the belief that RTO boosts company value, the analysis
    revealed that RTO mandates are more likely in firms with poor recent stock performance
    and have had no significant impacts on firm profitability or stock-returns. Moreover,
    a notable drop in employee job satisfaction was observed, further questioning
    the efficacy of these mandates.

    engagement and motivation as employees may lose a strong sense of belonging and
