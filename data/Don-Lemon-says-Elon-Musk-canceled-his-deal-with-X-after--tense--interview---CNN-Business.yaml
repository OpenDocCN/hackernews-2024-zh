    as we believe in providing a platform for creators to scale their work and connect
    with new communities,” the company said in a statement. “However, like any enterprise,
    we reserve the right to make decisions about our business partnerships, and after

  zh: 被一个用户问及决策的原因时，马斯克攻击了莱蒙和CNN，后者与莱蒙的新创业无关。
- en: “His approach was basically just ‘CNN, but on social media’, which doesn’t work,
    as evidenced by the fact that CNN is dying,” Musk wrote. “And, instead of it being
    the real Don Lemon, it was really just [former CNN chief] Jeff Zucker talking
    through Don, so lacked authenticity.”

  zh: 发言人表示：“唐已与X达成协议，并期望得到支付。”“如果必要，我们将诉诸法庭。”
- en: Lemon technically had not inked a contract with X, people familiar with the
    matter told CNN. But contracts do not necessarily have to be signed to be legally
    binding, particularly if it is clear each side had arrived at a mutual understanding.
    And according to the people close to the matter, Lemon’s camp is confident that
    a deal had effectively been struck, as evidenced by the fact that X had touted
    the deal in public announcements earlier this year. Moreover, Musk himself appeared
    to acknowledge that there had been a deal, texting Jay Sures, the UTA power agent
    who represents Lemon, “contract is canceled,” according to people familiar with
    the matter.

  zh: 熟悉此事的人告诉CNN，莱蒙在法律上尚未签订与X的合同。但是合同不一定非要签字才能具有法律约束力，特别是如果明确双方已达成相互理解。根据接近此事的人士称，莱蒙的团队确信已经达成了协议，这一点在X今年早些时候的公告中有所体现。此外，马斯克本人似乎也承认已经有了协议，根据熟悉此事的人士称，他给代表莱蒙的UTA强大代理人杰伊·苏雷斯发短信说“合同取消”。
- en: 'The deal’s implosion comes after Musk urged Lemon to launch a show on his platform,
    writing last year on X: “It’d be great to have [MSNBC host] Rachel Maddow, Don
    Lemon & others on the left put their shows on this platform. No exclusivity or
    legal docs required! You will receive our full support. The digital town square
    is for all.”'

    presidential candidate Nikki Haley. Lemon apologized for the remarks at the time,
