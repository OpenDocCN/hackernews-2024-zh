- en: I am a Scala developer and speaker who was cancelled three years ago. Yesterday
    I attended the High Court in London to hear an apology from several prominent
    members of the Scala community for making untrue claims about me on 27 April 2021\.
    I sued them for libel, and they admitted fault and settled, paying me costs and
    damages.

  zh: 我是一名Scala开发者和演讲者，三年前被取消。昨天，我在伦敦高等法院听取了几名Scala社区的知名成员就他们在2021年4月27日对我的不实言论道歉。我因诽谤起诉他们，他们承认错误并达成了和解，支付了我的费用和赔偿金。
- en: Their allegations were sensational and squalid, but unfounded. Their source
    was the resentment of one woman following a relationship in 2018, which I ended
    against her wishes. She fabricated or was offered an alternative narrative, which
    developed into claims of a pattern of behaviour, and culminated in the defendants’
    publication of an open letter, which they now agree is defamatory.

  zh: 他们的指控耸人听闻且卑劣，但毫无根据。它们的来源是一名女性对2018年一段关系的怨恨，而我则违背了她的意愿结束了这段关系。她捏造或接受了一种替代叙述，这发展成了一种行为模式的指控，并最终导致被告发布了一封公开信，现在他们也同意这封信是诽谤的。
- en: In two years of legal action, the defendants never presented any evidence to
    support their allegations, and admitted in court that they had no proper reason
    to make them. They have given undertakings to the court not to publish further
    or similar defamatory statements, or have anyone else do so on their behalf.

  zh: 在两年的法律诉讼中，被告从未提供任何证据来支持他们的指控，并在法庭上承认他们没有适当的理由提出这些指控。他们已向法院作出承诺，不再发布类似的诽谤声明，或者让他人代表他们这样做。
- en: No signatory contacted me about the allegations before publication. I received
    no warning, and had no knowledge of the claims’ substance. I only discovered what
    I was accused of at the same time as I learned of my indefinite exclusion from
    the community; at the same time everyone else found out. I had no opportunity
    to defend myself. It is no coincidence that the absence of due process led to
    an abject injustice.

  zh: 未在出版前有签署人与我联系。我没有收到任何警告，对指控的实质也毫无所知。我只是在被永久排除在社区之外的同时，才发现自己被指控的内容，就像其他人一样。我没有机会为自己辩护。由于缺乏正当程序，这不是偶然导致了严重的不公正。
- en: The experience of cancellation and enduring the online hysteria was traumatic.
    I responded by withdrawing from the life I knew. Its consequences hurt me and
    people close to me, and have been immiserating.

- en: My employment opportunities were obliterated. My charitable and educational
    projects, and my small business, could not continue. Despite my transferable skills,
    the allegations were a transferrable red flag recognised across programming communities
    and industries, and I have barely earned a living since. It has taken two years
    of legal action to receive fair scrutiny in a forum reliant on facts. This outcome
    finally vindicates me.

- en: Many familiar with the open letter will be surprised by this outcome, given
    the certainty expressed by some of the letter’s supporters. But they should question
    why no defence of my libel claim was ever offered. They should seek answers for
    how so many people became so convinced without evidence. And the defendants’ co-signatories
    should reassess the credibility of everything that compelled them to support the
    open letter.

  zh: 许多熟悉这封公开信的人会对这一结果感到惊讶，因为一些支持者表达了如此确定的看法。但他们应该质疑为什么从未提供我的诽谤索赔的任何辩护。他们应该寻找答案，了解为什么在没有证据的情况下如此多的人会如此确信。而被告的共同签署人应重新评估他们支持这封公开信时的一切的可信度。
- en: Nonetheless, I believe the open letter’s authors were convinced it was the right
    thing to do. I believe that they wished to show their kindness in response to
    a story which shocked them. Many of them I have known for years, and know to be
    good, moral people who were mistaken, and would not wish to be mistaken.

- en: Good people can make mistakes, without becoming bad people. So, I offer them
    the respect and compassion I believe they deserve. I recognise their good intent,
    and I interpret its consequences charitably. We owe each other civility in ceding
    the time and space necessary to reflect upon this in open enquiry, without coercion
    or urgency, so everyone can reach a better understanding of this outcome, and
