- en: Though the late star was considered by many to be the greatest actor of the
    20th century, Brando always had a love-hate relationship with his craft, often
    remarking that it was a [silly profession for a grown adult](http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2005/03/brando200503).
    He was so frustrated by acting that, in the late 1980s, he embraced a new technology
    that promised to keep him on the big screen while simultaneously lightening his

- en: In the new documentary *Listen to Me Marlon*, director Stevan Riley stitches
    together intimate home footage that the actor took over the years and combines
    it with rare interviews to portray Brando as a complicated and volatile soul.
    But the actor still had a spark for life before his death at age 80 in 2004, and
    he was fascinated with visual effects, as you can see in this exclusive clip above
    from the documentary, which you can watch above. The footage was originally intended
    for an experimental film called *Software*, which Brando tried to make in the
    1990s — more on that later — and features Brando, then in his seventies, delivering
    a monologue from *Macbeth*, his face rendered in blue pixels.

    —— 更多内容稍后讲述 —— 并且在其中，布兰多，当时70多岁，表演了*麦克白*中的一个独白，他的面孔以蓝色像素呈现。
- en: The technology in the clip, known as “digital equivalence,” involves creating
    a photo-realistic digital double of an actor that can look, move, and sound just
    like the original. It had long been a holy grail of the computer-graphics industry,
    and when Brando found out about its potential, he partnered with Scott Billups,
    a veteran cinematographer and graphics pioneer, in the pursuit of perfecting the
    technology.

    the late 1980s, when Billups was conducting digital experiments with an actor
    who lived near Brando’s Hollywood estate (Billups declined to identify the thespian
    by name). While that neighbor was unnerved by the idea of creating a digital double,
    Brando eagerly volunteered to be the next test-subject.

- en: “The friend was freaked, and thought it would kill acting and kill us all and
    put us out of business, but the test models worked, and you knew who was [on screen].
    So Marlon was like, ‘I’m next, I’m next,’” Billups said. They worked closely with
    Stephen and Lloyd Addleman, brothers who [invented an early version of the 3D
    scanner hardware](https://books.google.com/books?id=xlP1uoxU1nEC&pg=PA14&lpg=PA14&dq=Stephen+and+Lloyd+Addleman+cyberware&source=bl&ots=gEmbqlYhVv&sig=f10haQ9tsaT8n3H14OQnqaXdfUY&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CDMQ6AEwBGoVChMI0YHO2tnYxgIViowNCh3jmgSw#v=onepage&q=Stephen%20and%20Lloyd%20Addleman%20cyberware&f=false),

    Billups说道。他们与Stephen和Lloyd Addleman兄弟密切合作，他们发明了一个早期版本的3D扫描硬件，Billups将其比作先进的超市杂货扫描仪和旋转椅子。
- en: “The concept was for [the actor] to sit in this chair and get really still,
    and the scanner would go around you in 360 degrees [in] just under a minute,”
    Billups explained. “Sometimes the scanner would freeze up, so we’d spin the chair.
    You put somebody like Marlon in a chair and try to get an even spin on him — well,
    he’s really not the kind of guy who likes to sit still for long.”

    a motion capture studio where they hosted Brando’s A-list friends, including Faye
    Dunaway. (Dennis Hopper was also attached to the film early on.) “We were scanning
    them and doing mo-cap — we were going to do this whole movie with digital equivalents,”

    Billups说。“你可以在一周内完成电影，而不是在拍摄现场无聊地坐几个月。”
