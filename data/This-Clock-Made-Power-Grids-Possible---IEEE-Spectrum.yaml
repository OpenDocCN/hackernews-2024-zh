    quietly revolutionized power transmission by installing an electric clock in the

    were for a pendulum clock with a permanent magnet as its bob (that’s the weight
    at the bottom of the pendulum). The battery would provide an electric impulse
    to keep the pendulum swinging, by opening and closing a circuit depending on the
    amplitude of the pendulum swing. Unfortunately, these early clocks were lousy

    his first attempt at an electric chronometer was a crude motor that connected
    the gears of a clock to the Boston Edison electrical system. When he found that
    the clock was still losing 10 to 15 minutes a day, he called up the Edison power
    station—as one apparently did in 1915—and politely told them that their frequency
    was approximately a half cycle off. They countered that their instruments were
    correct, and Warren suggested the laboratory standards they used to check their
    meters must be in error.

    a reliable self-starting synchronous motor. Clocks and synchronous motors go hand
    in hand. In a synchronous motor, the shaft rotates at the same alternating-current
    frequency as the electric current; assuming the current is steady, it would be
    ideal for a clock. But in order to make his electric clock accurate, Warren needed
    an accurate and steady current, hence the master station clock.

- en: In 1916, the Warren Clock Co. began producing the Type A master station clock,
    which is actually two clocks superimposed on a single clock face. The dial is
    divided into five 1-minute sectors and has two hands, one black and one gold.
    The black hand is connected to a standard mechanical pendulum clock; the gold
    hand is driven by a synchronous motor. Both hands circle the clock face at 60
    seconds per minute. To read the clock, the operator simply had to check that the
    two hands were in sync; that would mean the generators were running at precisely
    60 hertz.

    Recall that Warren was initially working on an electric clock for the home, and
    he had a grand vision that every household would eventually own one. More electric
    clocks meant more electricity usage, which meant more revenue for the power companies.
    In a 1937 paper that Warren read before the Clock Club in Boston, he estimated
    that a power company could earn US $75,000 (about $1.6 million today) if 100,000
    customers each ran an electric clock 24 hours a day. Warren was thinking big for
