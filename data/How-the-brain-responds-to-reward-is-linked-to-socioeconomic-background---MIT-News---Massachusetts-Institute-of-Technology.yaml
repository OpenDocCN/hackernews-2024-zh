    the researchers found that children from lower SES backgrounds showed less sensitivity
    to reward than those from more affluent backgrounds.

  zh: 在一项关于12到14岁儿童社会经济地位（SES）差异广泛的研究中，研究人员发现，来自低SES背景的儿童对奖励的敏感性较来自更富裕背景的儿童要低。
- en: Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), the research team measured
    brain activity as the children played a guessing game in which they earned extra
    money for each correct guess. When participants from higher SES backgrounds guessed
    correctly, a part of the brain called the striatum, which is linked to reward,
    lit up much more than in children from lower SES backgrounds.

  zh: 使用功能性磁共振成像（fMRI），研究团队在儿童进行猜谜游戏时测量了他们的脑活动，每次正确猜测都能额外赚取一些钱。当来自高社会经济地位（SES）背景的参与者猜对时，与来自低SES背景的儿童相比，与奖励相关的大脑区域称为纹状体的活跃程度要高得多。
- en: The brain imaging results also coincided with behavioral differences in how
    participants from lower and higher SES backgrounds responded to correct guesses.
    The findings suggest that lower SES circumstances may prompt the brain to adapt
    to the environment by dampening its response to rewards, which are often scarcer
    in low SES environments.

  zh: 大脑成像结果也与来自低SES和高SES背景参与者在正确猜测后行为上的差异相吻合。研究发现，低SES环境可能会促使大脑通过减弱对奖励的反应来适应环境，因为在低SES环境中奖励通常较为稀缺。
- en: “If you’re in a highly resourced environment, with many rewards available, your
    brain gets tuned in a certain way. If you’re in an environment in which rewards
    are more scarce, then your brain accommodates the environment in which you live.
    Instead of being overresponsive to rewards, it seems like these brains, on average,
    are less responsive, because probably their environment has been less consistent
    in the availability of rewards,” says John Gabrieli, the Grover Hermann Professor
    of Health Sciences and Technology, a professor of brain and cognitive sciences,
    and a member of MIT’s McGovern Institute for Brain Research.

  zh: “如果你处于资源丰富的环境中，有许多奖励可获得，你的大脑会以某种方式调谐。如果你处于奖励更为稀缺的环境中，你的大脑会适应你所处的环境。相较于对奖励过于反应，这些大脑似乎对奖励的反应较少，因为他们的环境中奖励的可用性可能不够稳定，”约翰·加布里埃利（John

- en: Each of the participants underwent fMRI scanning while they played a guessing
    game. The participants were shown a series of numbers between 1 and 9, and before
    each trial, they were asked to guess whether the next number would be greater
    than or less than 5\. They were told that for each correct guess, they would earn
    an extra dollar, and for each incorrect guess, they would lose 50 cents.

- en: Unbeknownst to the participants, the game was set up to control whether the
    guess would be correct or incorrect. This allowed the researchers to ensure that
    each participant had a similar experience, which included periods of abundant
    rewards or few rewards. In the end, everyone ended up winning the same amount
    of money (in addition to a stipend that each participant received for participating

- en: 'Previous work has shown that the brain appears to track the rate of rewards
    available. When rewards are abundant, people or animals tend to respond more quickly
    because they don’t want to miss out on the many available rewards. The researchers
    saw that in this study as well: When participants were in a period when most of
    their responses were correct, they tended to respond more quickly.'

  zh: 先前的工作表明，大脑似乎会跟踪可获得奖励的速率。当奖励丰富时，人类或动物往往会更快地作出反应，因为他们不想错过许多可用的奖励。研究人员在这项研究中也看到了这一点：当参与者处于大多数回答正确的时期，他们倾向于更快地作出反应。
- en: “If your brain is telling you there’s a really high chance that you’re going
    to receive a reward in this environment, it's going to motivate you to collect
    rewards, because if you don’t act, you’re missing out on a lot of rewards,” Decker
    says.

  zh: “如果你的大脑告诉你，在这个环境中你会有很高的机会获得奖励，它会激励你去收集奖励，因为如果你不行动，你就错过了很多奖励，” Decker 说道。
- en: Brain scans showed that the degree of activation in the striatum appeared to
    track fluctuations in the rate of rewards across time, which the researchers think
    could act as a motivational signal that there are many rewards to collect. The
    striatum lit up more during periods in which rewards were abundant and less during
    periods in which rewards were scarce. However, this effect was less pronounced
    in the children from lower SES backgrounds, suggesting their brains were less
    attuned to fluctuations in the rate of reward over time.

  zh: 大脑扫描显示，纹状体的激活程度似乎与奖励速率的波动有关，研究人员认为这可能作为一种动机信号，表明有许多奖励可以获得。在奖励丰富的时期，纹状体更加活跃，在奖励稀缺的时期则较少。然而，在社会经济地位较低的儿童中，这种效应不太明显，这表明他们的大脑对奖励速率的波动反应较弱。
- en: The researchers also found that during periods of scarce rewards, participants
    tended to take longer to respond after a correct guess, another phenomenon that
    has been shown before. It’s unknown exactly why this happens, but two possible
    explanations are that people are savoring their reward or that they are pausing
    to update the reward rate. However, once again, this effect was less pronounced
    in the children from lower SES backgrounds — that is, they did not pause as long
    after a correct guess during the scarce-reward periods.

  zh: 研究人员还发现，在奖励稀缺的时期，参与者倾向于在猜对后花更长的时间作出反应，这是之前已经显示过的另一种现象。目前尚不清楚为什么会出现这种情况，但有两种可能的解释：一种是人们在品尝奖励，另一种是他们在暂停更新奖励率。然而，再次发现，来自低社会经济地位背景的孩子们在奖励稀缺时期猜对后暂停的时间较短，这种效应不那么明显。
- en: “There was a reduced response to reward, which is really striking. It may be
    that if you’re from a lower SES environment, you’re not as hopeful that the next
    response will gain similar benefits, because you may have a less reliable environment
    for earning rewards,” Gabrieli says. “It just points out the power of the environment.
    In these adolescents, it’s shaping their psychological and brain response to reward
    opportunity.”

- en: “Socioeconomic status is associated with the degree to which you experience
    rewards over the course of your lifetime,” Decker says. “So, it’s possible that
    receiving a lot of rewards perhaps reinforces behaviors that make you receive
    more rewards, and somehow this tunes the brain to be more responsive to rewards.
    Whereas if you are in an environment where you receive fewer rewards, your brain
    might become, over time, less attuned to them.”

    in relation to the environment in which one grows up, and there was very little
    evidence about the influence of SES.”
