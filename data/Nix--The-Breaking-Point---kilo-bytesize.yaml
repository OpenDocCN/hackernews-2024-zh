- en: A torrent of emotions and frustration have engulfed the Nix Community, however
    one may define it. Tensions between contributors are high, tensions between non-contributors
    are high. There is no joy in such an environment. Within the last calendar year,
    problems bubbling beneath the surface have boiled over, breaching the previously
    restricted confines of individual conversations or one-off occurrences in chat
    rooms. Something needs to change, or so it would seem, unless the current dismal
    state of affairs is intended to persist. What, then, should change? Who will drive
    this change forward? And, perhaps most importantly, how can history be stopped
    from repeating itself.

  zh: Landscape
- en: Nix, for the longest time, has operated organically. That is to say, rules and
    direction have only been constructed or provided once absolutely necessary. The
    growth of the project is beyond what one, two, or ten could manage on their own.
    As such, a bureaucratic body, the NixOS Foundation, was enshrined as the entity
    which would oversee legal requirements for the project as well as provide direction.
    This north star, however, was dim at best and misleading at worst. The lacking
    power, or described more bluntly, backbone, of the foundation has left it appealing
    to few. The entity is intended to provide oversight of Nix and its related projects,
    but has appeared to mostly be a vehicle for advertisement or legitimization of
    the businesses its members operate.

  zh: Nix 长期以来一直在有机运作。也就是说，只有在绝对必要时才会制定或提供规则和方向。项目的增长超出了一个人、两个人或十个人的管理能力。因此，NixOS
    基金会作为一个官僚机构被确立为监督项目的法律要求并提供方向的实体。然而，这颗北极星光芒最多时微弱，最糟时误导。基金会缺乏实权，或者更直言不讳地说，缺乏骨气，这使得它吸引力不大。尽管旨在监督
    Nix 及其相关项目，但似乎主要成为其成员经营业务的宣传或合法化工具。
- en: NixPkgs has operated in much the same way as previously described. Natural growth
    is difficult and, throughout the accumulation of hundreds of thousands of packages,
    the project certainly has its share of scars. Importantly, the package repository
    sees a much larger pool of contributors and interaction than Nix itself does.
    The ad-hoc structure of maintainers here better represent the goals of Nix users
    and their methods of success. Yet, these contributors are beginning to flee.

  zh: NixPkgs 的运作方式与前述类似。自然增长困难，尽管积累了数十万个软件包，但该项目确实有其痕迹。重要的是，软件包仓库看到比 Nix 本身更大的贡献者和互动群体。维护者的临时结构更能代表
    Nix 用户的目标及其成功方法。然而，这些贡献者开始逃离。
- en: The work being done for Nix and its surrounding official projects is difficult
    to map. A series of “teams”, ranging from security to moderation exist to compartmentalize
    the many processes and fulfill the requirements of Nix projects. Paradoxically,
    these teams are hardly more empowered than any other individual contributor, only
    benefiting from more direct modes of communication and name recognition. The management
    of projects and features is still wildly ad-hoc and limited significantly by the
    volunteer nature of these contributors. Frequent re-litigation of well-discussed
    issues for one's ego, rejection of reasonable contributions in rejection of a
    healthy ecosystem, and thinly-veiled hostility is a staple of the Nix landscape
    despite many refusing to admit such.

    Nix 领域中，经常为个人自我而频繁重新讨论经过深入讨论的问题，拒绝合理的贡献以及掩盖的敌意是一种常态。

    status as the central figure of Nix refuses to fulfill this position. Frequent
    inaction, unsatisfactory action, and a general disconnection from the entirety
    of the Nix community and ecosystem seem to be pervasive within the NixOS Foundation.
    Lacking the conviction to decide, fully, the direction of Nix for the entire ecosystem
    leaves the many corners of the community to construct their own interpretations.
    This model is not compatible with the current structure of Nix projects. Rather,
    the current boys-club of a foundation continues to stifle any natural ownership
    that contributors would develop for the many projects they provide value to.

    The NixOS Foundation was not created to become a body of inaction or divisiveness,

    Building Nix, NixOS, and all of the related tooling is still the fundamental desire

    Many of these can be avoided or understood as unnecessary territory, but it is
    inevitable for disagreements to form and tensions with them. The actions within
    the Nix sphere have invoked such a disagreement, proving it had been put off for
    far too long. One subset of said community believes in valuing the impact their
    actions have upon others. Another subset believes willful ignorance towards the
    effects of their actions is acceptable. One cannot compromise the two views.

    领域内的行动引发了这样的分歧，证明这种问题被搁置了太久。社区的一个子集认为重视其行动对他人的影响是必要的。另一个子集则认为对其行动影响的故意忽视是可以接受的。这两种观点无法妥协。
- en: The solution, however, is not one of compromise, but one of direction. Fundamentally,
    the community must be provided clear direction of Nix and its projects. Either
    it will be a project of conscientious action or one of ignorance. The limbo within
