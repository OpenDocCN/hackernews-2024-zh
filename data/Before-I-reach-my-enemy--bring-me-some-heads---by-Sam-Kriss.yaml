    instruments and singing; all folktales are traditionally attributed to him. One
    legend says that Korkut was an ambassador of the Khan to Mohammed: he rode with
    the Prophet on his campaigns and was the first of the Turks to accept Islam. But
    the book also says that he made strange prognostications that all came true, that
    he brought news from unseen and unseeable places, and that he personally heard
    the voice of God. A soothsayer; maybe a shaman. He has his feet in something older
    than Islam. He was in some contact with the other world, the one that lies just
    across the mirror of ice in the tundras and taigas of Siberia. Maybe he didn’t
    like what he saw there. According to tradition, Dede Korkut was terrified of death.
    Rashid al-Din says he lived for nearly three hundred years because he simply refused
    to die. The story goes that Korkut, ancient, withered, used to wander through
    the wastelands of Asia, fleeing death. Whenever he came to a town, he would find
    gravediggers at work. He would ask them whose grave they were digging, and they
    would reply: ‘We heard there is a man called Korkut who is looking for his grave;
    here it is.’ Finally, his wanderings took him to the place where he was born,
    and one of those holes in the ground claimed him. His mausoleum is outside Kyzylorda
    in Kazakhstan, on the banks of the Syr Darya. It was built by a team of Soviet
    architects and physicists in 1980, and contains a series of long tubes and pipes:
    whenever the winds blow across the steppe, the grave produces the sound of a lonely
    bow falling across the strings of a kobys. In a way, Dede Korkut got what he wanted:
    now he sings forever.'

  zh: Dede Korkut 是奥古兹土耳其人的神话战士吟游诗人。他发明了弦乐器和歌唱；所有的民间故事都传统地归功于他。一个传说说，科尔库特是可汗派给穆罕默德的大使：他与先知一同征战，并且是第一个接受伊斯兰教的土耳其人。但是这本书还说他做出了一些奇怪的预言，而且全部都实现了，他带来了来自看不见和无法看见的地方的消息，并且他亲自听到了上帝的声音。一个占卜者；也许是一个萨满。他的脚踏在伊斯兰教之前的某些事物中。他与另一个世界有某种联系，那个世界就在西伯利亚的冻土和针叶林的冰镜的对面。也许他不喜欢在那里看到的东西。根据传统，迪迪·科尔库特非常害怕死亡。拉希德·阿尔丁说他活了将近三百年，因为他简直不肯死。故事说科尔库特，古老而干瘪，经常漫游在亚洲的荒原上，逃避死亡。每当他来到一个城镇，他都会看到正在挖坟的人。他会问他们正在挖谁的坟，他们会回答：‘我们听说有个叫科尔库特的人正在寻找他的坟墓；在这里。’最后，他的漫游把他带到了他出生的地方，地上的一个坑宣告了他的命运。他的陵墓位于哈萨克斯坦的克孜勒奥尔达外，靠近斯里达利亚河。它是由一队苏联的建筑师和物理学家于1980年建造的，里面有一系列长长的管道和管子：每当风吹过大草原，墓地就会发出孤独的弓拉过科比斯琴琴弦的声音。从某种意义上说，迪迪·科尔库特得到了他想要的：现在他永远唱着。

    the narrative, and stories that had probably been set on the northern borders
    of China were transposed to the eastern borders of Rome. It was probably only
    when they were written down that Homeric elements entered the text: Tepegöz, but
    also Bamsi Beyrek’s return from captivity, which directly mirrors Odysseus’ return
    to Ithaca. (Lewis writes that ‘the alternative is to imagine that Homer borrowed
    some themes which he found circulating orally round western Asia Minor and which,
    still circulating after two millennia, were borrowed once more.’ He shrugs: ‘Well,

    meant to stitch together. At the end of every chapter in the Book of Dede Korkut,

    1658 *Urne-Buriall*. The essay has five chapters: the first four try to explain
    the disovery of some Anglo-Saxon tombs through a dense tissue of quotations on
    how various vanished societies handled their dead. So we learn via Gagunius that
    the Sarmatians burned their dead, and via Saxo and Olaus that the Sueons and Gothlanders
    did the same thing. We hear that ‘the *Scythians* who swore by winde and sword,
    that is, by life and death, were so farre from burning their bodies, that they
    declined all interrment, and made their graves in the ayr: And the *Ichthyophagi*
    or fish-eating Nations about Ægypt, affected the Sea for their grave.’ The Gospel
    of Mathew tells us that ‘the rigid Jews were wont to garnish the Sepulchres of
    the righteous.’ And so on. But the fifth chapter is a devastatingly personal reflection
    on the inevitability of death and the futility of all our attempts to survive
    ourselves. You can build huge monuments to yourself: time will wear them down.
    One day, rot will claim the singing grave of Dede Korkut. You can have children,
    but ‘Generations passe while some trees still stand, and old Families last not
    three Oaks.’ You can perform great deeds; they won’t last. The time is coming
    when every book will be lost and every song will be forgotten. ‘The greater part,’
    Browne writes, ‘must be content to be as though they had not been.’ It’s a true
    and awful line. I think about it a lot. I think about it every day.'

- en: 'The era in which we really expected things to be *original* was a brief one.
    It was already dying fifty years ago in 1974, when someone at Penguin decided
    to pretend that the Book of Dede Korkut was really a collection of quirky and
    inventive *characters*. It’s roughly coterminous with the age of the novel: starting
    with *Don Quixote*; maybe starting to collapse with Pierre Menard, who could produce
    a word-for-word replica of *Don Quixote* that was an entirely different text,
    simply because it was written by Pierre Menard and not by Miguel de Cervantes.
    As of 2024, that age is very definitively over. You people are—not illiterate,
    exactly, since you do still consume large quantities of text, but maybe *paraliterate*.
    You might be reading, but you’re certainly not reading *books*. Even the rare
    people who do read books sometimes strain with the unexpected effort it requires.
    It wasn’t so difficult when you were a kid! And not only because when you were
    a kid, you were reading cool stories about teenage spies, and now you’re an adult
    you have a copy of Vasily Grossman’s *Life and Fate* by your bedside, nine hundred
    pages thick, silently shaming you every single evening for not having even bothered
    to skim through the translator’s introduction. When you were a kid—sorry, but
    it’s true—we didn’t have all these phones. Digital text has calcified your brain
    in the same way that written text calcified the Yugoslav bards’. It’s not a question
    of *attention span*, because the dominant discursive modes online seems to be
    the multi-hour-long video essay or the interminable live stream in which literally
    nothing is said. But digital text makes the distemporality of ordinary text unbearable.
    To sit still and read a book for hours on the trot, you have to suppress the rising
    itch that starts on your fingertips and spreads everywhere over your skin. Make
    this responsive! Make this refresh! You’re experiencing the agony of the dead
    word of the book, where the future is already set down, waiting for you on the
    final page, where nothing *changes*… Digital text, meanwhile, is *writing that
    functions like speech*. Like speech it happens in real time, right in front of
    you, and then afterwards it sinks into the unreachable abysses of the feed. It’s
    *present*, it’s *alive*, while writing is always spectral and disjointed from
    itself. (Again, see Derrida to learn more than you ever wanted to know about *différance*
    and the ghostly metaphysics of non-presence and the other now-irrelevant features
    of this obsolete world.) This is why digital writing seems to make people much
    *angrier* than ordinary text: it seems to be addressed *to you* in a way that
    the words on a piece of paper do not. This is also why everything that appears
    on the internet is, from the perspective of the age of individuality and the novel,
    so *boring*. This medium does not favour originality. New versions of the epic
    formulas. We call them *memes* now: endlessly repeating pictures of frogs. Or
    TikToks where different people mouth along to the same words. Or the frothing
    opinion-mongers, serving up the same formulaic phrases in service of the same
    predictable positions. Everyone fights their rhetorical battles over and over
    again. In the Book of Dede Korkut, the infidel king Shökli is killed three times;
    another time he’s captured and converts to Islam in exchange for his life. It
    doesn’t matter. As soon as the next tale begins, he’s back where he was, in his
    evil fortress beyond the Iron Gate.'

    （再次，看看德里达，了解比你想知道的更多关于*差异*和非现实存在的幽灵形而上学以及这个过时世界的其他现在无关的特征。）这就是为什么数字写作似乎比普通文本更容易使人*愤怒*：它似乎是以一种纸上的字不会的方式向*你*发出的。这也是为什么互联网上出现的一切，从个性化和小说的时代来看，都如此*无聊*。这种媒介不利于原创性。史诗公式的新版本。我们现在称之为*模因*：无休止重复的青蛙图片。或者不同人用嘴配合相同词汇的TikToks。或者那些言论狂怒者，为了服务于同样可预测的立场，提供着相同公式化的词语。每个人都在一次又一次地进行修辞的战斗。在《德德·科尔库特之书》中，异教徒国王Shökli被杀了三次；还有一次，他被俘虏并改信伊斯兰教以换取生命。这并不重要。下一个故事开始的时候，他马上又回到了他原来的位置，在铁门之外的邪恶堡垒里。

    composition that is utterly, utterly insane. It’s a regime that makes this kind
    of constant low-level plagiarism inevitable, but sporadically punishes individual
    plagiarists for expressing its own structural contradictions. Academic writing
    is basically medieval, based on formulas and clichés, and absolutely packed with
    needless references and quotes from other works. (It’s all politics; everyone
    wants citations, so you suck up to your departmental allies by repeating their
    hideous sentences.) But it *pretends* to be something else: pioneeringly original
    insight. And your advancement in the academy, where hundreds of people can compete
    for every miserable low-paid gig, hinges on constantly publishing: a frenzied,
    psychotic vomit-stream of publication. The content of what you publish hardly
    matters. We just need words, more words, a surging black river of bountiful words.
    (This is a major factor in the replication crisis, which is science’s name for
    the fact that most published scientific research appears to be genuinely worthless,
    drawing conclusions that are often entirely untrue.) But since everyone is constantly
    writing their own papers, nobody really *reads* anything that gets published.
    Half of all peer-reviewed papers are read by exactly two people: the author, and
    the peer reviewer. So many of our (notionally) brightest minds are engaged in
    the intellectual equivalent of digging ditches and then filling them in again.
    Chances are that *nobody* read Claudine Gay’s dissertation until Rufo decided
    to go after her, not even the committees that hired her. (Meanwhile, a few ideologues
    claim that these same academics have been the motive force behind all cultural
    shifts over the past century. You can decide how plausible this seems.) In a way,
    there’s something very beautiful about this deranged activity. Imagine a society
    of poets, where everyone spends a lifetime quietly perfecting their art until
    they produce reams of shatteringly beautiful verse—but nobody ever shows anyone
    else what they’ve written, and in the end each poet’s body is burned on top of
    a pile of his works. The difference, though, is that academics desperately *want*
    to be read, to be cited, to take their place in the great chain of repeated words.
    So they plagiarise. It’s not just to cut corners; it’s not just because nobody’s
    checking. They’re yearning for that other world, the one that sings in thundering

    Maybe Emen died in his seventh rescue attempt. But in the morning, the *real*
    Emen arrives to join Yigenek’s army and storm the castle one more time. He’s alive.
    He had the same dream. He was won over by Yigenek’s argument, somewhere in the
    common wordless caverns of the night.'
