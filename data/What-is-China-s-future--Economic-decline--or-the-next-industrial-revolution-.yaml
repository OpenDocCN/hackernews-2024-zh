- en: China has a very large state sector. And of course, some people have claimed
    that this state sector is, in a sense, an impediment to growth. And we've seen
    a resurrection of this idea, *guo jin min tui* (国进民退), which is used to refer

- en: It's a very, very strange concept, in fact, because the third word is *min*
    (民), and *min* refers to people. So, what they are actually, in a sense, saying
    - these ideas were invented by neoliberal economists in 2002 - the private sector
    is equated with the people, which I find absolutely astonishing. But, I mean,
    the country does have a very significant public sector.

- en: What I find striking is that one can actually turn it around and say, what is
    it that these Western economists seem to think China should do? And they seem
    to think that China should privatize all assets into the hands of domestic and
    foreign capitalists. It should remove capital controls. It should open the door
    to foreign finance capital. It should transfer governance to liberal capitalist
    political parties that are actually controlled by capital.

  zh: 令我感到惊讶的是，人们实际上可以反过来问，这些西方经济学家似乎认为中国应该做什么？他们似乎认为中国应该将所有资产私有化，交到国内外资本家手中。应该取消资本管制。应该向外国金融资本开放大门。应该将治理权转交给由资本控制的自由资本主义政党。
- en: I think one of the most fundamental features of the China system is actually
    that it's the state that controls capital, rather than capital that controls the
    state. And it's, in fact, this aspect of the Chinese model, and in particular,
    the rule of the Communist Party of China that has basically transformed China
    from what was, effectively one of the poorest countries in the world into one
    of its largest industrial powers.

  zh: 我认为中国体制最基本的特征之一实际上是国家控制资本，而不是资本控制国家。事实上，正是中国模式的这一方面，特别是中国共产党的统治，基本上将中国从世界上效果上是最贫穷的国家之一转变为其最大的工业大国之一。
- en: So, in a way, it's a planned rational state in which the CPC has played an absolutely
    fundamental role. And without it, I mean, China would never have established the
    national sovereignty that permitted it to choose a path that suited its conditions
    and to radically transform the lives and livelihoods of its people.

  zh: '**RADHIKA DESAI：** 绝对是。我想补充几点，这与你们两位所说的非常契合。'
- en: The fact of the matter is that this was also true of the Soviet Union and the
    Eastern European countries when they were still ruled by communist parties. We
    generally refer to them as socialist or communist, but in reality, they themselves
    never claimed to be socialist or communist. They only said they were building
    socialism, especially in a country that was as poor as China was in 1949.

  zh: 事实是，苏联和东欧国家在仍由共产党统治时也是如此。我们通常称它们为社会主义或共产主义国家，但事实上，它们自己从未声称自己是社会主义或共产主义国家。他们只说他们在建设社会主义，特别是在1949年中国贫困的情况下。
- en: The leadership of the Communist Party of China has always understood that there
    has to be a long period of transition in which there will be a complex set of
    compromises that will have to be made in order to steer the economy in the direction
    of socialism, in order to build socialism.
  id: totrans-split-51

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 中国共产党的领导始终认识到，必须有一个长期的过渡期，在这个过渡期间，必须做出一系列复杂的妥协，以便引导经济朝着社会主义的方向发展，以建设社会主义。
- en: So, from its beginnings, the revolutionary state in China was a multi-class
    state and a multi-party state. People don't realize very often that while the
    Communist Party of China is the overwhelmingly most powerful party in China, there
    are other parties that exist as well, which reflect the originally multi-class
    character of China.
  id: totrans-split-52

  zh: 所以，从一开始，中国革命国家就是一个多阶级国家和多党国家。人们往往没有意识到，虽然中国共产党在中国是绝对最强大的党派，但也存在其他党派，这些党派反映了中国最初的多阶级特性。
- en: Now, it's true that since 1978, the government has loosened much of its control
    over the economy. But the important thing here is that the Communist Party retains
    control of the Chinese state.

  zh: 现在，事实是，自1978年以来，政府已经大大放松了对经济的控制。但这里重要的是，共产党保持了对中国国家的控制。
- en: The way I like to put it is, yes, there are lots of capitalists in China. Yes,
    those capitalists are very powerful. They are at the head of some of the biggest
    corporations in the world, and they are quite influential within the Communist
    Party. But what makes China meaningfully socialist or meaningfully treading the
    path to socialism, let's put it that way, is the fact that ultimately the reins
    of power are held in the hands of the Communist Party of China leadership, which
    owes its legitimacy to the people of China.

  zh: 我喜欢把它这样表达，是的，中国有很多资本家。是的，这些资本家非常强大。他们掌握着世界上一些最大的企业，并且在共产党内部具有相当大的影响力。但是，使中国具有意义上的社会主义特征，或者说是有意迈向社会主义的道路，最重要的是最终权力掌握在致力于中国人民的共产党领导层手中，这种领导层的合法性来自中国人民。

    they are held by the Communist Party leadership.

  zh: 因此，权力的主导不是由资本家掌握的；而是由共产党领导层掌握的。
- en: So, in that sense, I would say that China is meaningfully socialist. Although,
    as Mick pointed out, there is a fairly large private sector in China, but so too
    is the state sector very large. And the extent of state ownership means that even
    though the private sector is very large, the state retains control over the overall
    pace and pattern of growth and development in the country.
  id: totrans-split-56
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 因此，在这个意义上，我会说中国具有意义上的社会主义特征。尽管如米克所指出的，中国有一个相当大的私营部门，但国有部门也非常庞大。国家所有权的程度意味着，即使私营部门很大，国家仍然控制着国家整体增长和发展的节奏和模式。
- en: And I just add one final thing here, which is going to become quite important

    in China remains very heavily controlled by the state.

  zh: 最后，我想补充一点，随着我们讨论各种其他观点，这一点将变得非常重要，即中国的金融部门仍然受到国家的严格控制。

    and China's financial system is geared to providing money for long-term investments
    that improve the productive capacities of the economy and the material welfare
    of the people. And this is completely different from the kind of financial sector
    we have today.

    reform, after 1988, when China moved from a welfare to a commodity system. And

    that housing should be provided, as a commodity by developers.

    while the quality of housing and the amount of housing space per person was going

    this platform economy was associated with very, very strong tendencies towards

    adopted, basically, to restrict, some aspects of this platform economy, and other
    areas, like private tutoring, which was generating large disparities in the educational

    offering potential to sustain the growth of the Chinese economy into the years

    in Japan, industrial investment did not increase, largely, I think, because the

    at the beginning of the show, about China's structure. The effect of the real

    going to take, how is it going to solve the problem of local budgets without solving
    it by creating a booming real estate market for towns to sell off their property

    what both of you have said, which is that China has a very good chance, in fact,
    very likely, China is not going to follow the Japanification model because, as
    Michael is emphasizing, the structure of China's economy and the imperatives generated
    by that structure are very different.

  zh: 但也许让我简单地通过赞同你们两个说的话来结束，中国有很大的机会，事实上，很可能中国不会遵循日本化模式，因为正如迈克尔强调的那样，中国经济的结构及其所产生的必要性是非常不同的。
- en: To name just one, if something is not profitable in a capitalist economy, it
    will not get done. Whereas in the case of the Chinese economy, the Chinese government
    can always say, well, if it's necessary, we'll do it even if it isn't profitable,
    because it is necessary for the welfare of the people or the productive capacity
    of the economy, etc. So, profitability just does not play the role of a brake
    in the same way as it does in capitalist societies.

  zh: 举个例子，如果在资本主义经济中某事不赚钱，它就不会做。而在中国经济的情况下，中国政府总是可以说，如果有必要，我们会做，即使它不赚钱，因为它对人民福祉或经济的生产能力等是必要的。因此，盈利性不会像在资本主义社会中那样起到制约作用。
- en: Secondly, the role of the state, both in terms of initiating new projects and
    taking responsibility for new projects, and we can already see in the current

    for further economic expansion. And secondly, of course, the industrial opportunities,
    the opportunities for a new industrial revolution are many, and China in particular,
    because of the important state role in the Chinese economy, the centrality of
    the state role in the Chinese economy, and the aim of the Chinese economy and
    the Chinese economy's managers to develop China's productive capacity in whatever
    way that works, not necessarily through private ownership.

- en: These elements are actually going to ensure that China will exploit the opportunities

    in the 1980s was at the technological frontier, and China is not. But just, what

- en: You know, basically all land is state-owned, is either state-owned or owned
    by the rural collectives. But what happened was that if land was converted for
    use for urbanization, was converted for use for urbanization, for housing, then
    basically the local government could in effect sell leases, 90-year leases, or
    depending on the activity, different lengths of lease. They could sell these leases
    to developers. And then that revenue was used by local government to fund infrastructure.

- en: Will a property tax be introduced in order to generate government revenue rather
    than relying upon this land tax? Because of course that did encourage local government
    to allocate that land to people who are going to build housing for upper-income

    would actually be higher rather than providing that land to construct housing
