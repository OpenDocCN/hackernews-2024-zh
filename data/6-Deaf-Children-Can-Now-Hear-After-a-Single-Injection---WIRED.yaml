    to carry it. Doctors carefully injected a tiny amount of liquid containing the
    viruses into a part of the children’s inner ears called the cochlea, a spiral-shaped
    chamber that contains hair cells. The first patient in the trial received the
    gene therapy in December 2022\. Researchers followed the participants, who ranged
    in age from 1 to 6 years old, for 23 weeks after treatment.

- en: While the gene therapy did not give the children a “normal” level of hearing,
    they went from not hearing anything under 95 decibels—about as loud as a food
    processor or motorcycle—to perceiving sounds of around 45 decibels—the level of
    a typical conversation or the hum of a refrigerator.

- en: Other children in the study had previously received a cochlear implant in one
    ear and had already learned to speak. In those cases, doctors injected the gene
    therapy into their other ear. Cochlear implants are surgically implanted devices
    that stimulate the auditory nerve to provide a sense of sound to its wearer. The
    implants don’t reproduce natural hearing, though. The resulting sound can be robotic
    or distorted. And when they’re switched off, the wearer can’t hear at all.

  zh: 研究中的其他儿童此前已在一只耳朵中接受了人工耳蜗植入，并已学会说话。在这些情况下，医生们将基因疗法注射到他们的另一只耳朵中。人工耳蜗植入装置是一种外科植入式装置，可以刺激听觉神经以提供听觉感知。然而，植入装置不能复制自然听觉。产生的声音可能是机械的或失真的。当它们关闭时，佩戴者将听不到任何声音。

- en: One child’s hearing didn’t improve at all. One explanation, Shu says, is that
    the child had preexisting immunity to the type of virus used to carry the new
    gene into the inner ear cells—meaning the treatment would have been destroyed
    by their immune system before it could take effect. It’s also possible that the
    dose was too low to be effective, Lustig says.

  zh: 一名儿童的听力并没有改善。舒士解释说，其中一个原因是该儿童对用于携带新基因进入内耳细胞的病毒类型具有先天免疫力——这意味着治疗在产生效果之前就会被他们的免疫系统摧毁。拉斯蒂格说，剂量可能太低而无效。

- en: Colin Johnson, a biochemist at Oregon State University who studies otoferlin,
    calls the results of the Chinese and US studies a “dramatic development.” Scientists
    have been interested in restoring otoferlin for years but have struggled with
    how to get the gene inside virus particles. The otoferlin gene is large—about
    6,000 DNA letters long—and doesn’t fit into the viruses used for gene therapy.
    Scientists eventually figured out they could split the gene in two and deliver
    the pieces separately. When tested in mice, the gene came together in the inner
    ear and allowed them to hear.

  zh: 俄勒冈州立大学生物化学家**科林·约翰逊**研究了听素蛋白，他称中国和美国研究的结果是一个“戏剧性的发展”。科学家多年来一直对恢复听素蛋白感兴趣，但一直苦于如何将基因置于病毒颗粒内。听素蛋白基因很大，约有6000个DNA碱基对长，并且无法适应用于基因治疗的病毒颗粒。科学家最终想出了将基因分成两部分并分开传递的方法。在小鼠中进行测试时，基因在内耳中汇合并使它们能够听到声音。
