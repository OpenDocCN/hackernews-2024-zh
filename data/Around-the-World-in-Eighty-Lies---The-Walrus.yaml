    billed as “best-in-class journalism about hidden places, incredible history, scientific
    marvels, and gastronomical wonders,” and texted it to a few soup-obsessed friends.
    Then I forgot about it for months until the weather turned chilly and I pulled
    up the link again, only to notice the article had changed. An italicized editor’s
    note had been added to the top, which began: “This article has been retracted

    state that multiple details and interviews had been fabricated.'

    Obscura](https://www.atlasobscura.com/)*，这是一个线上出版物，被誉为“有关隐藏地点、令人难以置信的历史、科学奇迹和美食奇观的最佳新闻报道”，然后把它发给了几个热爱汤的朋友。然后我好几个月都忘了它，直到天气转凉，我又打开了链接，只是注意到文章已经改变了。一个斜体的编辑注释已经被添加到了顶部，开始写道：“本文由于不符合Atlas

    which, it turned out, had similar retractions. Topics ranged widely: acoustic

    the townsfolk of Moffat had never done such a thing; experts and locals quoted

    seem to actually exist. It was an astonishing volume of lies packed neatly into
    an 1,100-word article. Fiction masquerading as journalism is nothing new, but
    in the age of Google Alerts and plagiarism checkers, it seems like it ought to
    be impossible to sustain a year-long series of audacious lies. How can a writer

- en: Founded in 2009, *Atlas Obscura* is an online publication specializing in descriptions
    and stories of offbeat destinations, created as the antithesis of the well-trod
    itineraries offered by popular guidebooks. It has attracted millions of dollars
    in funding and expanded into a travel planning app, a retail review site, and
    a food-focused vertical called Gastro Obscura. The editorial mission is to tell
    true stories that seem, at first glance, to be stranger than fiction, which is
    perhaps why Mastbaum’s strange fictions seemed so plausible. His stories weren’t
    outlandish; they were well researched and populated with factual details, with
    believable quotes attributed to real people. Writing them was at least as much
    work as reporting truthfully would have been, suggesting they weren’t born of
    intellectual or professional laziness but some other, more inscrutable, motivation.

    Obscura的食品垂直网站。编辑任务是讲述那些乍一看似乎比虚构更奇怪的真实故事，这或许是为什么马斯特鲍姆的奇异虚构故事看起来如此可信的原因。他的故事并不离奇；它们经过了深入的研究，并且以真实的细节为依据，用真实的人物来引述可信的引述。写作它们至少和真实报道一样费力，这表明它们并不是出于智力或专业上的懒惰，而是出于其他更难以理解的动机。
- en: It seems likely that everything unravelled with the final article about Moffat,
    which also bore the longest editor’s note—perhaps Mastbaum had gotten carried
    away with his ornamental flourishes. One of the sources who denied speaking with
    Mastbaum, an urban planner from Poland named Agata Łopuszyńska, replied to my
    message in which I’d asked how she had found out about the article. “That’s a
    crazy story,” she wrote back. Łopuszyńska learned about the article when a man
    from a dark-sky organization in the UK emailed to ask her about it. She had never
    been to Scotland or heard of Mastbaum and was shocked to see quotes, and even
    photographs included in the article, attributed to her. Soon after other baffled
    sources reached out to *Atlas Obscura*, Łopuszyńska was contacted by an editor,
    who told her about an email exchange between himself and Łopuszyńska that Mastbaum
    had provided as proof that he had interviewed her. It even included a fake Polish
    phone number, Łopuszyńska said, which Mastbaum had told *Atlas Obscura* he had
    used to contact her on WhatsApp. Łopuszyńska doesn’t use WhatsApp. The email exchange
    had been fabricated. Most bizarre was a one-word email (“hello”) Łopuszyńska found
    in her junk folder, sent by Mastbaum two weeks after the story had been published.

  zh: 一切似乎都在最后一篇关于莫法特的文章中崩溃了，这篇文章也带有最长的编辑说明——也许马斯特鲍姆已经被他那些华丽的修饰所带走了。一位否认与马斯特鲍姆交谈过的消息来源之一，名叫阿加塔·乌普辛斯卡（Agata
    Łopuszyńska）的波兰城市规划师，在我询问她是如何得知有关文章的消息时回复了我的信息。“那真是一个疯狂的故事，”她回信道。乌普辛斯卡是在一位来自英国一个关于黑暗天空的组织的男子发邮件询问她的情况时得知这篇文章的。她从未去过苏格兰，也没听说过马斯特鲍姆，并且对在文章中看到归因于她的引述甚至照片感到震惊。在其他困惑的消息来源与《Atlas
    Obscura》联系后不久，乌普辛斯卡被一位编辑联系，他告诉她有一封邮件交换，证明他曾采访过她，这封邮件是马斯特鲍姆提供的证据。乌普辛斯卡说，邮件中甚至包括一个假的波兰电话号码，马斯特鲍姆告诉《Atlas
    Obscura》他用这个号码联系她的WhatsApp。乌普辛斯卡不使用WhatsApp。这封电子邮件的交换是伪造的。最奇怪的是，乌普辛斯卡在她的垃圾邮件文件夹里发现了一封只有一个字的电子邮件（“你好”），是马斯特鲍姆在这篇文章发表两周后发的。

    website, not just appended with an editor’s note. “For me it would be best to
    no longer see my name in such a scam,” she wrote to me. When I spoke with Samir
    S. Patel, editor-in-chief of *Atlas Obscura*, he acknowledged that they had unpublished
    some of Mastbaum’s stories. “But that’s not proper journalistic practice,” he
    said. When the errors in the Moffat piece came to light, the website conducted
    an investigation and temporarily unpublished stories as other issues emerged.
    Afterward, they republished those stories, without their images and with the addition
    of editor’s notes. “We want there to be a record,” he explained. It was the same
    approach taken by the *New York Times* in 2002, when its editors discovered errors
    and fabrications in Michael Finkel’s reporting on child slavery in West Africa,
    and in 2003, when the newspaper discovered that staff reporter Jayson Blair had
    fabricated details in at least thirty-six stories.

    S. Patel）交谈时，他承认他们取消了一些马斯特鲍姆的故事。“但这不是正当的新闻实践，”他说。当莫法特故事中的错误被发现后，网站进行了调查，并临时取消了其他问题的故事。之后，他们重新发布了这些故事，没有附上图片，而是添加了编辑说明。“我们希望有一份记录，”他解释道。这与*纽约时报*在2002年发现迈克尔·芬克尔（Michael

    reached out to them. Once they realized there were problems with the story, he
    explained, they did a complete review of all of Mastbaum’s work, reaching out
    to every single source and documenting the inconsistencies in an editor’s note.
    According to Patel, Mastbaum ghosted them after the editors notified him of the
    full review. Patel still stands behind their editorial process. “I wouldn’t say

    Coffey is best known for writing and directing the 2005 film *Ellie Parker*, starring
    the Australian actress Naomi Watts. When Mastbaum organized a GoFundMe for Coffey’s
    dental expenses in the summer of 2023, a donor named Naomi Watts contributed $2,000—a
    detail worthy of a fabulist. On Instagram, Mastbaum documented his travels in
    the UK and Spain, places that later appeared in his *Atlas Obscura* stories. Online,
    it’s easy to glean enough details about a stranger’s life to assemble a vivid

- en: 'Aside from *Atlas Obscura*, his only significant journalism credit, Mastbaum
    published similar stories on a now-idle Substack: quirky, detailed digressions
    into cultural practices and his experiences abroad. Most were about Europe, but
    one caught my eye because it was about a nation closer to home: the Kwakwaka’wakw
    tribes of coastal BC. The post included a quote from Jennifer Kramer, an associate
    professor of anthropology and museum curator at the University of British Columbia.
    I sent her an email to ask if she had ever spoken with this writer. No, she wrote
    back quickly, adding, “It is disturbing to learn that he has falsely cited me.”
    Some details included in the post, Kramer told me, were accurate, while others
    were completely wrong. I looked up a quote attributed to the famous anthropologist
    Franz Boas and found that it came from a book by another scholar, written eight
    years after Boas died. The overall effect of the post was similar to that of one
    of those AI-generated images of a person with too many fingers: almost but not
    quite convincing. “Parts of the descriptions stem from accuracy but they have
    become distorted or read completely wrong to produce stereotypical or offensive
    results,” Kramer replied. (I ran the Substack post through Copyleaks, an online
    tool that promises to tell you “with exceptional accuracy” whether a piece of
    text has been authored by AI. It came back as definitively human.)'

    BC 的 Kwakwaka’wakw 部落。这篇文章包括了一段来自不列颠哥伦比亚大学人类学副教授兼博物馆策展人 Jennifer Kramer 的引文。我给她发了一封电子邮件，询问她是否曾与这位作者交谈过。她迅速回复说没有，并补充道：“发现他虚假引用了我的话令人不安。”
    Kramer 告诉我，文章中的一些细节是准确的，而另一些完全错误。我查找了一个被归因于著名人类学家 Franz Boas 的引文，发现它来自另一位学者的书，是在
    Boas 去世八年后写的。这篇文章的整体效果类似于那些由人工智能生成的带有太多手指的人的图像：几乎但不完全令人信服。“部分描述源自准确性，但它们变得扭曲或完全读错了，从而产生了刻板或冒犯性的结果，”
    Kramer 回答道。（我将 Substack 文章通过 Copyleaks，一个在线工具，它承诺“以异常准确度”告诉您一段文本是否由人工智能撰写。结果显示文章绝对是人类创作的。）

    a similarly confounding mix of fact and fiction. “Some [of his sources] got back
    to us and said, ‘Yes, this is an accurate reflection of the conversation that
    I had with this writer.’ Others got back to us and said, ‘I feel like I said this,
    but I don’t think I said this in this case.’ Or ‘I have said this, but I didn’t

    a sordid tale about the eponymous eight-year-old heroin addict that was briefly
