- en: There's a recognition that plastic is so engrained in modern life, and it plays
    important roles in medical devices and other things, that it's almost impossible
    to envision a world where we move completely beyond plastic.

  zh: 人们认识到塑料已经深深融入现代生活，并在医疗设备等方面发挥着重要作用，以至于几乎不可能想象一个完全摆脱塑料的世界。
- en: I think what people are talking about is reducing plastic production to a level
    that is more manageable with kind of recycling systems, getting rid of types of
    plastic that are especially hard to recycle, you can't recycle, being more transparent
    about what chemicals go into this stuff that again, make recycling hard, but it
    really does come down to when you talk to not just activists, but also businesses,
    increasingly, that regulation is going to play a big role.

  zh: 我认为人们讨论的重点是将塑料生产降低到一个更容易管理的水平，通过改进回收系统，淘汰特别难回收甚至不可回收的塑料类型，对这些材料中使用的化学物质更加透明，这些物质再次使回收变得困难。但实际上，无论是与活动家还是企业的对话，越来越多地，监管都将发挥重要作用。
- en: And so that, you know, there was a hearing in the Senate and the head of SC
    Johnson, A big consumer goods company, said something to the effect of we need
    government regulation. Businesses can't do this on their own.

  zh: 所以你知道，参议院听证会上，大消费品公司SC Johnson的负责人表示，我们需要政府监管。企业无法单独完成这项任务。
- en: And I think, you know, again, that gets back in large part to the economics
    of this if companies don't have to deal with these costs. It's hard to imagine
    that they will in sort of a sustained way, create systems to deal with this if
    they don't have to.

  zh: 而我认为，这又大部分归结于经济因素，如果公司不必承担这些成本，很难想象他们会持续创造系统来应对这一问题。
