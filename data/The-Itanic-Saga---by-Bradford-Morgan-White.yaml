- en: Mikhail Alexanderovich Kartsev was born on the 10th of May in 1923\. He was
    born to a family in the USSR whose erstwhile occupation was pedagogy. It was a
    nation newly reborn of revolution at the time. He graduated from high school on
    the 21st of June in 1941 and the Third Reich invaded the USSR the following day.
    Kartsev, along with a multitude of his countrymen, were drafted into the Red Army.
    His service to his country began in October of that year with enlistment in a
    tank regiment. He saw combat in the northern Caucasus, Ukraine, Romania, Hungary,
    Czechoslovakia, and Austria. Fate was kind to Kartsev, and he survived the war
    without any grievous physical harm. His enlistment ended in Feburary of 1947 with
    him having received medals for courage, for the capture of Budapest, the Order
    of the Red Star, and for victory over Germany.

    with the radio faculty of the Moscow Power Engineering Institute. He earned his
    degree in just three years, and began graduate studies in 1950\. This brought
    him to a rather exciting new project that would set the path of his career, the
    M-1\. This was one of the USSR’s first computers, and it was among the first stored
    program computers in the world. The project was led by Isaak Bruk and Nikolay
    Matykhin. Kartsev proved to be both talented and bright, and these qualities earned
    him a permanent position in Bruk’s laboratory, and a position as the lead on the
    M-2\. The M-2 project was completed in a year and half with a very small team.
    It wasn’t the most powerful machine in the USSR, but Kartsev said it was *a solid
    computer*. The M-1 and M-2 were computers made for civil use cases.

    M-2项目在一年半的时间内由一个非常小的团队完成。它并不是苏联最强大的机器，但卡尔采夫说它是一个*可靠的计算机*。 M-1和M-2是为民用情况而设计的计算机。

    of Electronic Control Machines of the USSR Academy of Sciences with Kartsev as
    the lab’s leader. His first project was the EUM M-4 followed by the M-4M. The
    M-4M was capable of twenty thousand operations per second. This machine used 23
    bit binary numbers with fixed point. Its RAM was 1K of 24 bit numbers and it had
    a program ROM of 1280 30 bit numbers. I/O control was separated from the main
    CPU and had its own RAM. I/O had fourteen channels with a combined throughput
    of six thousand numbers per second. This was a fully transistorized and real-time
    machine, and it was primarily used by the military for armament controls. For
    this work, Kartsev earned the USSR State Premium (I understand this to have been
    one of the highest awards in the USSR).

  zh: 在1957年底或1958年初，苏联科学院电子控制机械研究所开设了第二个实验室，卡尔采夫担任该实验室的负责人。他的第一个项目是EUM M-4，随后是M-4M。
    M-4M每秒可进行两万次操作。该机器使用23位二进制数字带有固定点。其RAM为1K 24位数字，程序ROM为1280个30位数字。I/O控制与主CPU分开，并具有自己的RAM。
    I/O具有14个通道，每秒的组合吞吐量为六千个数字。这是一台完全晶体管化和实时机器，主要用于军事武器控制。因此工作，卡尔采夫获得了苏联国家奖（我了解这是苏联最高奖项之一）。
- en: In 1962, unsatisfied with the performance of the M-4M, Kartsev set about the
    design of a new computer. The M4-2M was finished by the 14th of March in 1963
    (less than a year total of development time). This machine was capable of two
    hundred twenty thousand operations per second for programs stored in ROM. For
    programs loaded into RAM, this performance was roughly halved. RAM depended upon
    configuration ranging from 4K to 16K words of 29 bits. ROM was 4K or 8K depending
    upon configuration. I/O speeds were slightly higher than the M-4M, but similar
    in construction. One key of the M4-2M was that arithmetic, logic, and control
    operations (including matrix multiplication) were executed in a single machine
    cycle, and this machine was capable of floating point arithmetic. If this wasn’t
    enough power, the machine could be complimented with an M4-3M peripheral calculator
    and hardware interface system. RAM could be expanded after installation through
    the use of magnetic drum. An M4-2M equipped with the 3M was capable of roughly
    four hundred thousand operations per second.. The M4-2M was in operation at some
    locations for roughly thirty years with time to failure usually being over one
    thousand hours.

  zh: 1962年，不满意M-4M的性能，卡尔采夫开始设计一台新的计算机。M4-2M在1963年3月14日完成（总共不到一年的开发时间）。这台机器能够每秒执行22万次操作，适用于存储在ROM中的程序。对于加载到RAM中的程序，性能大致减半。RAM取决于配置，范围从4K到16K字，每个字29位。ROM根据配置为4K或8K。I/O速度略高于M-4M，但构造类似。M4-2M的一个关键是算术、逻辑和控制操作（包括矩阵乘法）在一个机器周期内执行，而且这台机器能够执行浮点运算。如果这还不够强大，这台机器可以配备M4-3M外围计算器和硬件接口系统。通过使用磁鼓，安装后可以扩展RAM。配备3M的M4-2M每秒能执行大约40万次操作。在一些地方，M4-2M已经运行了大约三十年，故障时间通常超过一千小时。
- en: In 1966 building upon the single-cycle nature of M4-2M’s arithmetic and control,
    Kartsev designed a system that would be capable of one billion operations per
    second. To achieve this, the proposed M-9 would utilize a RISC-like architecture
    that was explicitly parallel. In a single cycle, the machine would be able to
    execute thirty two instructions. This machine never went into production, but
    it was the first design of a very long instruction word (VLIW) machine. The primary
    idea that makes a VLIW system standout from any other is that each instruction
    word carries multiple instructions. The scheduling of these instructions then
    becomes the duty of either the language compiler or the assembler (either software
    or human). The M-9 was not to be, and Sergey Lebedev’s BESM-6 was chosen for those
    applications where the M-9 would have been useful.

  zh: 1966年，利用M4-2M算术和控制的单周期特性，卡尔采夫设计了一个能够每秒执行十亿次操作的系统。为了实现这一目标，拟议的M-9将利用类似RISC的明确并行体系结构。在一个周期内，该机器将能够执行32条指令。这台机器从未投入生产，但它是非常长指令字（VLIW）机器的第一个设计。使VLIW系统与其他任何系统不同的主要思想是每个指令字携带多条指令。然后，这些指令的调度成为语言编译器或汇编器（软件或人类）的职责。M-9并未实现，而是选择了谢尔盖·列别杰夫的BESM-6，用于M-9本来可能有用的应用。
- en: In 1969, Kartsev began work on the M-10\. This was an M-9 with vector processors
    (essentially). This machine was in use by 1973 largely for missile detection and
    warning systems as well as uses in Soviet space program. Toward the middle of
    the 1970s, the M-10 saw use in scientific research first with solid matter studies,
    and later with plasma modelling and collapse. This machine was followed by the
    M-13 in 1978 which was an improvement on the M-10 in most ways through the use
    of LSI. The M-13 was… extremely wide with two hundred twenty five parallel execution
    units. This machine also saw use in the Soviet space program. The work on these
    VLIW machines were put to paper in Kartsev’s book “Computation systems and synchronous
    arithmetic.” During his career M. A. Kartsev was awarded the Red Banner of Labor,

    Institute of Physics and Technology in 1957\. He was awarded the USSR State Premium
    and the Order of Lenin for his work on Elbrus 2 at the Lebedev Institute. The
    Elbrus 1 (developed and built in 1972 - 1978) and 2 (developed and built in 1980
    - 1985) computers were essentially the 1965 BESM-6 RISC design that were superscalar,
    out-of-order machines in LSI with each CPU being comprised of several discrete
    chips. These machines added type safety with high level language support in hardware,
    and failsafe capabilities. Babayan began working on a successor to these during
    the middle 1980s. This was the Elbrus 3\. It was VLIW machine building on Kartsev’s
    ideas. This dropped the high level language support of Elbrus 1 and 2, and it
    went wide with sixteen execution units. The first Elbrus 3 chips were fabricated
    in 1991\. According to Babayan, one major limitation of the Elbrus 3 was that
    Russia’s VLSI technologies weren’t great at the time.

    in 1946 in the Bronx. He earned his BA in mathematics from NYU, and then his PhD
    in 1979\. For his thesis, he created the trace scheduling compiler algorithm,
    coined the terms instruction level parallelism and VLIW. Fisher had no knowledge
    of Kartsev’s work at the time as the Soviet Union wasn’t going to release any
    information on military systems. HP called their VLIW implementation based upon
    Fisher’s work EPIC (explicitly parallel instruction computing), and it was intended
    to be a successor to PA-RISC with the initial code name for the chip being PA-WideWord.
    Intel had launched the i860 in 1989 which was a VLIW chip also based upon Fisher’s
    work, but that chip was failing in the market. This failure was largely due to
    the complexity of compilers required to accurately predict the runtime path of
    any given instruction through the chip. As compilers improved, so did the i860\.
    The issue was that by the time the i860’s performance was really acceptable traditional
    RISC machines had already taken the market and were far easier to develop for
    while also being cheaper. This contrasts very strongly with Elbrus of which Babayan

    Long Instruction Word）的概念。当时，费舍尔并不知道卡尔采夫的工作，因为苏联不会发布有关军事系统的任何信息。HP根据费舍尔的工作基于VLIW实现了EPIC（显式并行指令计算），它旨在成为PA-RISC的后继者，最初的芯片代号为PA-WideWord。英特尔在1989年推出了i860，这也是一款基于费舍尔工作的VLIW芯片，但该芯片在市场上失败了。这个失败主要是由于需要复杂的编译器来准确预测任何给定指令在芯片中的运行路径。随着编译器的改进，i860的性能也在提高。问题在于到i860的性能真正可接受的时候，传统的RISC机器已经占领了市场，并且更容易开发，而且价格更便宜。这与巴巴扬对Elbrus的评价形成了鲜明对比：

    and HP and Intel teamed up to work on a new 64 bit VLIW design. For HP, producing
    their own chips wasn’t a great idea. They wouldn’t have the kind of volume to
    make the enterprise economical, but Intel would. For Intel, sharing the cost of
    development was an obvious win, and so it was that PA-RISC and i860 would have
    a shared successor. This partnership was formalized in 1994, with John Crawford
    stating “*when we saw WideWord, we saw a lot of things we had only been looking
    at doing, already in their fully glory*.” For Sun, however, their VLIW project
    was abandoned. David Ditzel left Sun and founded Transmeta along with Bob Cmelik,

- en: In the west at this time, things were getting extremely competitive. Alpha,
    PowerPC, SPARC, MIPS, and 32 bit x86 were all battling for space in workstations
    and datacenters. There was some emerging thought that RISC had shortcomings in
    the area of parallelism and dynamic instruction scheduling. Some were also worried
    that clock speeds would fail to increase. Pipelining (and more importantly superscalar
    designs {multiple pipelines}), speculative execution, branch prediction, and out-of-order
    execution were the way this was addressed in some designs of the day. The problem
    with these approaches is that if the branch prediction is incorrect, the entire
    pipeline(s) is irrelevant and must be flushed. The deeper the pipeline, the worse
    the penalty in performance. With VLIW/EPIC, this complexity is moved to the compiler
    with the compiler telling the CPU what can be run simultaneously. This does result
    in some design simplicity around pipelining and the like, but the software ecosystem
    then grows enormously more complex. For the Elbrus team, this wasn’t as big a
    problem as the software and hardware were all designed in-house with software
    being tailored to the hardware. The use cases for the Elbrus CPU were also extremely
    well known to the designers, and could therefore be easily optimized.

    was compatible with the current industry standards. To this end, IBM, SCO, Sequent,

    in 1998\. The hope was that they’d build a single UNIX operating system that could
    run across multiple architectures. IBM was contributing POWER ISA support, SCO
    was providing 32 bit x86 support, Sequent provided multi-processing support, and
    Intel provided the Merced architecture information. Much of this integration work
    and Merced software development was actually being done by SCO. Within five months,
    SCO UNIX (essentially [XENIX](https://www.abortretry.fail/p/the-history-of-xenix))
    was running on Merced with testing being completed and announced by the 8th of
    April in 1999\. In a period spanning about the next seven months, SCO had incorporated
    technologies from the other players into their x86 offerings, and they’d made
    it possible to run x86 binaries on Merced. However, in May of 1999, IBM and Intel

- en: 'After three years of delays, Merced shipped as Itanium on the 29th of May in
    2001\. The first OEM systems from HP, IBM, and Dell were shipped in June. Itanium,
    whose architecture was now referred to as IA-64, was a 6-wide VLIW chip running
    at either 733 to 800 MHz with a 266 MT/s front side bus. It had 16K of L1 cache,
    96K of L2 cache, 2 or 4 MB of L3 cache, and it was a single core chip on socket
    PAC418 built on a 180nm process. That this chip under performed is an understatement.
    Given the long development time, multi-billion-dollar development cost, significant
    hype, and claims that it would out-compete everything on the market… Itanium was
    a massive failure. The 32 bit x86 chips of the time were able to best it in most
    workloads. Embarrassingly, the Pentium 4 (whose own performance wasn’t that good)
    beat Itanium on integer performance and memory bandwidth. Those areas where the
    chip was strong were in transaction processing and scientific applications. John
    Crawford, Merced project leader at Intel, reflects: “*Everything was crazy. We
    were taking risks everywhere. Everything was new. When you do that, you''re going
    to stumble.*” The five hundred person team working on the chip was also relatively
    inexperienced, and disagreements between HP and Intel led to many compromises
    in design.'

    was led by HP instead of Intel, and tape out was completed in December of 2000

    with McKinley by reducing memory latency and increasing memory bandwidth, increasing
    the L2 cache, and excluding floating point from the L1 cache. The L3 cache was
    moved on-die as well which increased its bus bandwidth and decreased its latency.
    While McKinley reduced the pipeline depth to eight stages (Merced had ten), this
    was made up for by increasing the clock speed, bus speed, and caches. McKinley’s
    launch name was Itanium 2 and its debut was on the 8th of July in 2002\. It was
    made on a 180nm process with 221 million transistors on chip. The clock speed
    was 900 MHz, the front side bus speed was 400 MT/s, and it was a single core machine

    came too late. On the 5th of October in 1999, AMD announced their competitor to
    IA-64\. The SledgeHammer microarchitecture (K8, AMD64 ISA) would implement 16
    bit, 32 bit, and 64 bit x86 compatibility. On the 10th of August in 2000, AMD
    released the x86-64 Architecture Programmers Overview. This was the instruction
    manual for the new architecture. Importantly, releasing the manual for developers
    ahead of the launch ensured software compatibility in both Linux and Windows.
    By the time that Itanium was launched, a user of an Itanium system had Windows
    XP 64-bit Edition, Linux, or HP-UX as potential operating systems. Itanium’s x86
    emulation, however, was so bad that any software written for Windows or Linux
    and compiled for x86 was going to run terribly. Ultimately, this meant that most
    of the machines sold were running HP’s own HP-UX. AMD64 did not suffer these issues
    at all. It could natively run any 32 bit x86 operating system and accompanying
    software.

    XP 64位版、Linux或HP-UX作为潜在的操作系统。然而，Itanium的x86仿真非常糟糕，以至于为Windows或Linux编写并编译为x86的任何软件都将运行得非常糟糕。最终，这意味着大多数出售的机器都在运行HP自己的HP-UX。AMD64完全没有遇到这些问题。它可以本地运行任何32位x86操作系统和相应的软件。

    it became obvious that the price vs performance of Opteron made it a good choice
    for a broad market segment. It was competing well against IBM POWER, Alpha, and
    Itanium 2\. It had support from Microsoft (Windows Server 2003), Red Hat, SuSE,

    on a new 130nm process which helped keep the power requirements from creeping
    too high for the socket. Madison was followed in November of 2004 by Madison 9M
    which further increased the L3 cache to 9M and increased the clock speed to 1.6
    GHz. Critically for scientific computing, Itanium 2 still had floating performance

    in 2024). The company was overly optimistic. Actual sales for Itanium were $1.4
    billion (around $2.28 billionin in 2024). While this was a marked improvement
    over 2003 where Itanium was in the realm of $479 million (around $799 million
    in 2024), it still wasn’t really enough. HP represented seventy six percent of
    those sales in 2004, IBM was ten percent, Dell was five percent, SGI was four
    percent, Fujitsu was one percent, and the remainder were sales by Groupe Bull,
    NEC, Legend, LangChao, and Unisys. The surprising bit here is that Fujitsu, with
    one percent of the total Itanium market, sold just two hundred thirty three Itanium
    systems in 2004 which shows both just how low the sales of Itanium really were,
    and how high the price tag was. Essentially, with the disappearance of Alpha,
    MIPS, and PA-RISC, consumers didn’t adopt Itanium but instead turned to IBM POWER,
    Sun SPARC, and AMD Opteron. HP’s UNIX server sales dropped by ten percent while
    IBM’s gained thirteen percent. While a bad year for Itanium, Babayan joined Intel
    in 2004\. With Babayan, came the Elbrus E2k which could execute both Elbrus VLIW
    and x86 machine code, and the team working for Babayan became Intel’s Russian
    R&D unit. The E2k was capable of executing twenty instructions per clock. While
    it ran at just 300 MHz, the large parallelism made it competitive against other
    chips. For software, the E2k could run Linux or a number of real-time operating
    systems developed for it. The chip was built on a 130nm process of 75.8 million
    transistors and consumed just six watts of power. At Intel, Babayan became the
    Director of Architecture for the Software and Solutions Group, and the scientific
