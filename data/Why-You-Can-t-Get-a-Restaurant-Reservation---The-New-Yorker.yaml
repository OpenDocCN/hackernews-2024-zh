    science, regularly uses fake phone numbers and e-mail addresses to make reservations.
    When he calls Polo Bar, he told me, “Sometimes they recognize my voice, so I have
    to do different accents. I have to act like a girl sometimes.” He switched into
    a bad falsetto: “I’m, like, ‘Hiiii, is it possible to book a reservation?’ I have
    a few Resy accounts that have female names.” His recent sales on Appointment Trader,
    where his screen name is GloriousSeed75, include a lunch table at Maison Close,
    which he sold for eight hundred and fifty-five dollars, and a reservation at Carbone,
    the Village red-sauce place frequented by the Rolex-and-Hermès crowd, which fetched
    a thousand and fifty dollars. Last year, he made seventy thousand dollars reselling
    reservations.'

    I play ‘Dinner Reservations,’ ” he said. “It’s just a way to pass the time.” Last
    year, he made eighty thousand dollars reselling reservations. He’s good at anticipating
    what spots will be most in demand, and his profile on the site ranks him as having

    and Modern Gastronomic Culture](https://www.amazon.com/Invention-Restaurant-Gastronomic-Culture-Historical/dp/0674006852),”
    in the eighteenth century, dining out in Paris or London meant going to a tavern
    where dinner was served at a common table, until the food ran out—first come,
    first served. In the U.S., reservations began to be more common sometime after
    the turn of the century, when it became popular to dine out for special occasions:
    Christmas, New Year’s Eve, Election Night. More commonly, wealthy men “reserved”
    private rooms at restaurants to entertain guests. (In New York, people vied to
    host the most elaborate private dinners: at one, the center of a huge table at
    Delmonico’s was removed and replaced with a water tank, for a centerpiece of four
    swans on loan from Prospect Park.)'

    Park的四只天鹅的中心装饰。）

    rental cars, hotels, and airlines had moved advance booking online, Web sites
    like Savvydiner.com started brokering restaurant reservations. Diners would click
    a button, prompting a Savvydiner employee to telephone a restaurant’s maître d’,

    Warner LeRoy, started taking reservations on the restaurant’s Web site. Other
    restaurateurs were skeptical. OpenTable charged restaurants a monthly fee, plus
    a dollar for every guest seated. Asked by a reporter what he thought about online
    reservations, the director of operations at Danny Meyer’s Union Square Cafe scoffed,
    “There is no substitute for a kind, human voice on the phone.’’ But Meyer became
    an early investor in OpenTable, and, later, in Resy. Last year, he invested in
    an A.I.-powered reservation platform called SevenRooms, which most people haven’t
    heard about because it’s been designed for diners not to know it exists.

    told me, “It’s not just the person who booked. If there are four people, they
    want to know all four of those people.” Diner profiles and guest notes are useful
    for deciding who lands a table and also where to seat people—Siberia or a cozy
    booth? (A new startup, Tablz, offers diners the opportunity to pay between five
    and a hundred dollars to reserve their favorite tables at select New York restaurants.)

- en: 'At Polo Bar, Leventhal had talked a lot about the challenge that restaurants
    face in deciding who to let in the door: “We need restaurants to be democratic,”
    he said (a sentiment I heard over and over). “But they can’t be—in order for them
    to be sustainable. The margins are so thin, and there’s not enough room for everyone.”
    That’s why restaurants like to identify and reward V.I.P. and regular customers.
    If a restaurant deems you important enough—and decides to label you as a “V.I.P.,”
    “P.P.X.,” (*personne particulièrement extraordinaire*), “reg,” “$$$$” or “soi”
    (short for soigné) on its in-house system—you might notice a little gold-and-black
    crown emoji and more available tables next time you sign in to Resy.'

    利润率如此之低，容不下每个人。” 这就是为什么餐厅喜欢识别和奖励 V.I.P. 和常客。 如果餐厅认为你足够重要，并决定在其内部系统中将你标记为“V.I.P.”，“P.P.X.”（*personne
    particulièrement extraordinaire*，法语：特别非凡的人）， “reg”，“$$$$”或“soi”（soigné的缩写），你可能会注意到一个小金色和黑色的皇冠表情符号，并且在你下次登录

    margins at American restaurants have languished at around four per cent. Gitnux,

    margins. They should come here, have an experience, and leave very happy.” Other
    restaurateurs told me they wished their diners understood that every minute a
    restaurant is open is money earned or money lost; four out of five restaurants
    close within five years. “We’re constantly bleeding money,” Jenn Saesue, of the

    At Eulalie, in Tribeca, a woman answers the phone and writes your name in a reservation
    book—no e-mail, no OpenTable. The best way into Frog Club is to write to a secret
    e-mail address. But it is rare these days to find a happening restaurant that
    does not take reservations at all. Lucali, the thin-crust-pizza place in Brooklyn’s
    Carroll Gardens, might be the most famous: Jay-Z once called the pies the best
    in Brooklyn. Mark Iacono, who runs the place, told me, “It’s first come, first
    served. People start lining up at two o’clock.” By four o’clock, there’s a line
    around the block to book tables for that evening; the first seating is at five.
    I stopped by on a chilly afternoon in March, at 2 *P.M.*, and found a half-dozen
    people waiting. At the head of the line, a cannabis-company executive named Ben
    Zachs said, “I’m first! I got here at 12:37 *P.M.* Today’s my wife’s birthday,

    Iacono告诉我：“先到先得。人们从两点开始排队。”到了四点，队伍已经绕着街区排队预订当晚的桌子；第一次入座是在五点。我在三月的一个寒冷下午两点来到这里，发现已经有半打人在等候。排在队伍最前面的是一位名叫Ben
