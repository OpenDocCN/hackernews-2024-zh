  zh: 什么是信息技术
- en: "Perhaps we should start by first defining what IT really is. According to the\
    \ Information Technology Association of America, information technology is \x93\
    the study, design, development, implementation, support or management of computer-based\
    \ information systems, particularly software applications and computer hardware.\x94\
    \ Essentially anything that has to do with computers and computing is some form\
    \ of information technology. Therefore, whenever organizations choose to buy computers,\
    \ databases, networks, software, or many other computer related materials, they\
    \ are making an investment in IT. Although on the surface this seems like a great\
    \ thing, the reality is that it\x92s not immediately evident that investing in\
    \ IT is actually profitable. In fact, much of the evidence from the 1960s to the\
    \ 1980s indicated otherwise."

  zh: 或许我们应该首先定义IT究竟是什么。根据美国信息技术协会的定义，信息技术是“基于计算机的信息系统的研究、设计、开发、实施、支持或管理，特别是软件应用和计算机硬件。”
    基本上，任何与计算机和计算有关的事物都是某种形式的信息技术。因此，每当组织选择购买计算机、数据库、网络、软件或许多其他与计算机相关的材料时，它们都在进行IT投资。尽管表面上看起来这似乎是一件好事，但实际情况是，投资IT是否真的有利可图并不立即明显。事实上，从1960年代到1980年代的大部分证据表明情况并非如此。

  zh: 关于生产力悖论
- en: The productivity paradox (also the Solow computer paradox) is the peculiar observation
    made in business process analysis that, as more investment is made in information
    technology, worker productivity may go down instead of up. This observation has
    been firmly supported with empirical evidence from the 1970s to the early 1990s.
    This is highly counter intuitive. Before investment in IT became widespread, the
    expected return on investment in terms of productivity was 3-4%. This average
    rate developed from the mechanization/automation of the farm and factory sectors.
    With IT though, the normal return on investment was only 1% from the 1970s to
    the early 1990s.

  zh: 生产力悖论（也称为索洛技术悖论）是在业务流程分析中做出的奇特观察，随着对信息技术的投资增加，工人的生产力可能会下降，而不是上升。这一观察得到了从1970年代到1990年代初的实证证据的坚定支持。这是非常反直觉的。在IT投资普及之前，预期的生产力投资回报率为3-4%。这一平均率是由农场和工厂部门的机械化/自动化发展而来。然而，从1970年代到1990年代初，IT带来的正常投资回报率只有1%。
- en: There were a number of theories proposed that explained the productivity paradox.
    There ranged from ideas about inadequate measurement of productivity to the necessary
    lag period before actual gains in productivity could be seen. Until recently these
    explanations were little more than theories, but now many of them have hard evidence
    to support then due to studies that show a large increases in productivity in
    companies that invested heavily in IT.

  zh: 有多种理论提出来解释生产力悖论。这些理论从生产力的不充分测量到实际生产力增益之前的必要滞后期间的想法都有。直到最近，这些解释仅仅是理论，但现在许多都有了实证支持，因为研究表明，大量投资IT的公司生产力大幅提升。

    and his colleagues in his paper, [Measurement or Management?: Revisiting the Productivity
    Paradox of Information Technology](http://www.diw.de/documents/publikationen/73/38739/v_00_4_9.382949.pdf).
    According to MacDonald, the paradox began to take place in the early 1970s and
    progressed through 5 stages.'

  zh: 阶段1
- en: These were the early days, when not much was known about the implications of
    IT investment and expectations were huge. The idea of IT investment was so novel
    that there was a broad notion that IT was going displace labor entirely. Ever
    since this early period of investment in IT, it was assumed that labor productivity
    was the correct way to measure the impact IT had.

  zh: 这些是早期，关于IT投资影响的了解很少，但期望很高的时期。IT投资的概念是如此新颖，以至于普遍认为IT将完全取代劳动力。自从这一早期的IT投资时期以来，人们就认为劳动生产率是衡量IT影响的正确方法。

  zh: 第二阶段
- en: This stage started in the late 1970s and marked the first indications that the
    result of IT investment was less than expected. Even though this was the case,
    companies continued to funnel huge amounts of capitol into computing. Most companies
    didn't even bother to try and evaluate their IT investment. Those that did usually
    only used return on investment calculations.

  zh: 第三阶段
- en: This stage, which spanned the early 1980s, was marked by the realization that
    IT was only to be used in terms of productivity. Instead, companies began to use
    IT strategy. Several comapanies (American Airlines, American Hospital Supplies,
    and Citibank) strategically used IT to create a competitive advantage over their
    competitors.

  zh: 这个阶段跨越了80年代初，其特点在于意识到IT只能在生产力方面使用。相反，公司开始使用IT战略。几家公司（美国航空公司，美国医院用品公司和花旗银行）战略性地利用IT来在竞争对手面前获得竞争优势。

  zh: 第四阶段
- en: By the late 1980s IT investments migrated to management information systems.
    In this new area IT was no longer expected to be directly productive. It was also
    during this time that numerous explanations for the productivity paradox emerged.
    Although none of them individually provided a concrete explanation, collectively
    they hinted at a larger problem.

  zh: 到了80年代后期，IT投资转移到了管理信息系统。在这个新领域中，不再期望IT直接产生生产力。同时，关于生产力悖论的许多解释也在这个时期出现。虽然它们单独并未提供具体的解释，但总体上它们暗示了一个更大的问题。
