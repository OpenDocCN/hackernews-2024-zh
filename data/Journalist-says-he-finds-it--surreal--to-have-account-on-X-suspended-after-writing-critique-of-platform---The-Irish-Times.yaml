- en: Journalist and author Séamas O’Reilly has said he finds it “very, very funny”
    that his account on X, formerly Twitter, was suspended just hours after he posted
    about an article he wrote for the Irish Examiner in which he said the platform
    was unusable due to bots.

  zh: 记者和作者谢阿马斯·奥雷利（Séamas O’Reilly）表示，他发现他在X上（以前是Twitter）的账号在他发布了一篇他为爱尔兰审查报上写的文章几个小时后被暂停，“非常、非常有趣”。
- en: The author’s account had over 100,000 followers and was around 14 years old,
    he said. Having gone through his posts from Saturday, which is when the account
    was suspended, he has come to the conclusion that the post that caused the suspension
    was to do with his article on bots.

  zh: 作者的账号拥有超过100,000名粉丝，已经存在了大约14年，他说。他回顾了自己在周六的帖子，也就是账号被暂停的时候，得出结论称，导致被停用的帖子与他的关于机器人的文章有关。
- en: “So, to me, it’s pretty blatant and obvious that [an] Irish-headquartered tech
    behemoth, operated by the world’s most famous man, has suspended an Irish journalist
    for making those points in an Irish newspaper,” O’Reilly said.

  zh: “因此，对我来说，这是非常明显和显而易见的，一个由世界上最著名的人运营的总部设在爱尔兰的科技巨头，因为一个爱尔兰报纸上发表这些观点而停用了一名爱尔兰记者的账号，”
    奥雷利说。
- en: “I don’t actually think that the removal of my personal account is actually
    riveting and important global news in and of itself; I’m not that arrogant. But
    I do think it is a pretty hilarious bit of overreach from the guy who is a self-proclaimed
    free speech absolutist. So I do think it is quite noteworthy and quite surreal,
    to be honest.”

- en: O’Reilly appealed the first notification he got to say his account was suspended
    immediately. The suspension cited platform manipulation and spam as its reasoning,
    which he wrote in his appeal that he had nothing to do with.

    blue check mark, meaning that, unlike me, it pays money every month to Elon Musk’s
    vastly indebted and unprofitable platform, a situation which would greatly disincentive
    his company taking proactive measures to weed them out”.

    annoying but professionally quite depressing” as Twitter was his route into his
    current profession as a journalist and author. He used it as a “shop front” in

    for me... But it’s really at the point where it doesn’t really work in practical
    terms. It is not as useful as an object as it used to be. It incentivises lots
    of extremely negative and hateful speech and has really made that a big kind of
    calling card of its business for the last year or two... that you can go on there
