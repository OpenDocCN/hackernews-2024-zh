- en: In 1916, a serious debate about cats was consuming the country’s attention.
    Conservationists blamed cats for being the greatest threat to the country’s bird
    life, while cat-lovers accused bird-lovers of hysteria. The conflict was often
    reduced to zero-sum terms, with the naturalist John Burroughs declaring that “the
    preservation of birds involves the nonpreservation of cats.” Even casually, people
    had to pick a side. Carl Van Vechten quipped that “One is permitted to assume
    an attitude of placid indifference in the matter of elephants, cockatoos, H. G.
    Wells, Sweden, roast beef, Puccini, and even Mormonism, but in the matter of cats
    it seems necessary to take a firm stand.”

  zh: 1916年，一个关于猫的严肃辩论引起了全国的关注。保护主义者指责猫是对国家鸟类生活最大的威胁，而喜爱猫的人则指责鸟类爱好者过于歇斯底里。这场冲突经常被简化为零和游戏，自然主义者约翰·伯罗斯宣称“保护鸟类意味着不保护猫类。”
    即使是随便一提，人们也必须选择立场。卡尔·范维克顿调侃说：“在大象、凤头鹦鹉、H·G·威尔斯、瑞典、烤牛肉、普契尼甚至摩门教问题上，我们可以保持一种宁静的冷漠态度，但在猫的问题上似乎有必要采取坚定的立场。”
- en: When he surveyed the matter, Edward Howe Forbush recognized that it had “reached
    an acute stage.” After seeing that “recently published assertions for and against
    the cat, freely bandied about, have absolutely no foundation in fact,” he set
    out to correct the record by writing a comprehensive and extensively researched
    report on the “value or inutility of the domestic cat.”

  zh: 当爱德华·豪·福布什调查此事时，他认识到问题“已经到达了急性阶段。”在看到“最近发布的关于猫的赞成和反对的断言，自由传播，完全没有事实根据”，他决定通过撰写一份全面的、广泛研究的报告来纠正这一记录，报告讨论“家猫的价值或无用性”。
- en: Forbush, the State Ornithologist of Massachusetts, began his 1916 report by
    presenting the contradictions in a cat’s nature that made the debate so heated.
    “The cat, of all animals, is in some respects the most intimate companion of man
    … its independent character and its graceful, quiet movements appeal particularly
    to women,” while “the delightful, playful activity of its young make it a welcome
    fireside companion throughout the civilized world … Nevertheless, it leads a dual
    existence.” At night, the cat becomes “a wild animal, pursuing, striking down
    and torturing its prey … Now it ravages the dovecote; now it steals on the mother
    bird asleep on her nest, striking bird, nest and young to the ground. In the darkness
    of night it turns poacher. No animal that it can reach and master is safe from
    its ravenous clutches.”

  zh: 马萨诸塞州的州鸟类学家福布什在他的1916年报告中首先介绍了猫的这种自然特性的矛盾，这使得争论如此激烈。“猫，在所有动物中，在某些方面是人类最亲密的伴侣…它的独立性格和优雅、安静的动作尤其吸引女性”，而“其幼崽的可爱、活泼的活动使其成为全文明世界的受欢迎的家庭伴侣…然而，它过着双重生活。”
    在夜晚，猫变成“野生动物，追逐、击倒和折磨它的猎物…现在它肆虐于鸽舍；现在它偷袭母鸟在巢里沉睡，将鸟、巢和幼鸟击落到地面上。在黑夜的黑暗中，它变成了偷猎者。任何它能接触和控制的动物都无法逃脱它贪婪的爪子。”
- en: Unsurprisingly, Forbush came down on the side of the birds. In this, he found
    agreement with most other conservationists. “The most important problem confronting
    bird protectors to-day is the devising of a proper means for the disposition of
    the surplus cat population of this country,” said the pioneering ornithologist
    Frank Chapman. One writer placed cats first among the threats to songbirds, followed
    by “small boys, English Sparrows, [Italian laborers](https://birdhistory.substack.com/p/the-italian-problem-part-i-bird-killing),
    and Starlings.” Another wrote that “we have been told to weariness of the ravages
    of the small boy with a gun and the woman with feather dressed hat; but as a destroyer
    of song birds the cats make away with more birds in a year than the small boys
    in a century; and kill more small birds than all the millinery hunters in the
    country.”

  zh: 毫不奇怪，福布什站在了鸟类一边。在这一点上，他与大多数其他保护主义者达成了一致。“今天困扰鸟类保护者的最重要问题是设计一种合适的方法来处理这个国家的过剩猫群问题”，这是开拓性鸟类学家弗兰克·查普曼的看法。一位作家将猫排在对鸣鸟的威胁中的首位，其次是“小男孩、英国麻雀和[意大利工人](https://birdhistory.substack.com/p/the-italian-problem-part-i-bird-killing)和星雀。”
    另一位写道：“我们已经厌倦了小男孩带枪和戴羽毛帽的女人对鸣鸟的破坏；但作为鸣鸟的破坏者，猫一年比小男孩在一个世纪内杀死的鸟还要多；而且比全国所有帽子猎人杀死的小鸟还要多。”
- en: Through at least the 1930s, there was no such thing as an indoor cat. Most cats
    were considered working animals, and were expected to rid houses and barns of
    mice and rats. But by the end of the 19th century, they began taking on other
    roles, especially that of animal companion. Yet even when they were the object
    of a great deal of affection — what we’d think of as pets today — they were still
    seen as part wild, and most could still come and go as they pleased. In his 1916
    survey, Forbush found that “about ninety per cent of the cats are allowed to roam
    at night.”

  zh: 直到1930年代，没有室内猫这样的概念。大多数猫被视为工作动物，人们期望它们在房屋和谷仓里消灭老鼠。但到19世纪末，它们开始承担其他角色，尤其是作为动物伴侣。即使当它们受到大量喜爱时
    —— 这在今天我们会认为是宠物的情况下 —— 它们仍被视为半野生的一部分，大多数仍可随意出入。在他的1916年调查中，福布什发现，“大约百分之九十的猫被允许在夜间漫游。”
- en: 'A 1923 edition of Lippincott’s Silent Reader, intended for second grade students,
    explained why these outdoor cats were so harmful to bird populations: “Cats are
    the worst enemy of birds. The greatest harm is done during the nesting season.
    The young birds cannot protect themselves against the cat. The nests on the ground
    can easily be found, or the cat can climb the trees. Even after the young leave
    the nest the cat can catch them while they are learning to fly.” Young birds were
    easy targets for cats, and they were extremely efficient at cleaning out nests.
    One of Forbush’s correspondents reported that “during the past five years in our
    yard in the city the robins have never succeeded in raising a brood of young ones
    which escaped the fate of being mauled to death by cats.”'

    年幼的鸟类对猫来说是易捕捉的目标，它们在清理巢穴方面非常高效。福布什的一位通讯者报告说，“在我们城市的院子里，过去五年来，知更鸟从未成功地养育过一窝幼鸟，这些幼鸟没有逃过被猫折磨致死的命运。”

    cats by carrying them, in bag, basket or box, outside the towns,” which resulted
    in “stocking practically every piece of woodland with these arch-enemies of bird-life.”
    And “heartless ‘summer cottagers’” were accused of taking cats along on their
    beach vacations and abandoning them on their return home, leaving “thousands of
    deserted cats wandering along the beaches and dunes of our coast.” These deserted
    cats “reverted to the wild state, bred in the woods, and the numbers of their

    这些被遗弃的猫“恢复了野生状态，在树林中繁衍生息，它们的后代数量增加，成为了对小型猎物、昆虫食性鸟类和家禽的威胁，必须找到一种压制它们的方法。”
- en: But there was nowhere that cats did so much damage as on islands. As far back
    as 1916, it was recognized that “wherever cats have been introduced and allowed
    to multiply unchecked upon an island, they have decimated, driven out or exterminated
    the birds.” Over and over again, cats were introduced by fishermen and lighthouse
    keepers to the small, rocky islands off Maine and Massachusetts, where they wreaked
    havoc on seabirds, who raised their chicks in nests placed directly on the bare
    ground.  “A great colony of petrels on [Maine’s] Great Duck Island has been decimated
    in recent years by a few cats kept there by the lighthouse keepers,” wrote Forbush,
    while on Muskeget Island, near Nantucket, a warden predicted that if “cats continued
    to increase they would exterminate the entire colony of some 45,000 birds within
    five years.”

  zh: 但是没有一个地方比岛上受到的猫的破坏更为严重。早在1916年，人们就认识到“无论猫何时在岛上被引入并且被允许不受限制地繁殖，它们总是在岛上大肆破坏，逐渐消灭或者灭绝鸟类。”
    猫常被渔民和灯塔管理员引入缅因州和马萨诸塞州沿岸的小岛上，那里的海鸟在裸露地面上筑巢，它们的雏鸟因此常受到重创。 “一群大脚海鹰在[缅因州]大鸭岛上因近年来灯塔管理员饲养的少数猫而大为减少，”
    福布斯写道，而在南塔克特岛附近的马斯基特岛上，一位看守员预言，“如果猫继续增加，它们将在五年内消灭约45,000只鸟的整个种群。”
- en: Yet the real reason bird-killing cats were considered a problem was that they
    threatened the income of farmers, and through them, the food supply of the country.
    Cats would occasionally target poultry, and “the ordinary chicken killer gets
    from 2 or 3 to 12 in a day,” although “usually its career is short.” Cats could
    also do tremendous damage at game farms, and the marauding cats were killed in
    response. “Such destruction of cats is a necessity,” said Edward Forbush, “otherwise
    practically no game can be raised.” One reader protested that *Bird-Lore* published
    a picture of five dead cats, killed at the New York State Game Farm, to which
    the publication retorted that she “indicates no regret over the fact that these
    five cats had killed and eaten $5,000 worth of young pheasants.”

  zh: 然而，猫成为问题的真正原因是它们威胁到农民的收入以及通过他们而来的国家食品供应。猫有时会盯上家禽，“普通的杀鸡猫一天可以捕杀2到3只或者12只，” 尽管“通常它们的生涯很短。”
    猫也会在养鸟场造成巨大的损失，对于这些抢掠的猫，人们也做出了回应。“消灭这些猫是必要的，” 爱德华·福布斯说，“否则几乎无法养殖游戏。” 一位读者对《鸟类杂志》刊登了五只死去的猫的图片提出抗议，这些猫是在纽约州的养殖场被杀死的，对此，该出版物回应说她“对这五只猫因杀死和吃掉价值5000美元的幼雉并不感到遗憾。”
- en: Much more seriously, cats killed the birds that ate the bugs that destroyed
    farmers’ crops. Charles Pease reasoned that “if crops are worth money, the birds
    that save them from pest destruction are worth money, and the cat takes money
    out of your pocket every time it catches a bird.” Defenders of cats naturally
    contended that cats save money by catching the mice and rats that eat a farmer’s
    grain, a value which one writer placed at nine dollars per year. But when [economic
    ornithologists](https://birdhistory.substack.com/p/economic-ornithology) studied
    the matter, they found that cats did “a great deal more damage in the destruction
    of birds than good in the destruction of mice and rats.” Each “seed-eating bird,”
    they asserted, was worth a dollar per year to the farmer, and they estimated that
    the average cat killed fifty birds annually.

    爱猫者则反驳说，猫通过捉老鼠省钱，这些老鼠会啃食农民的谷物，一位作家估计每年能省下九美元。但是，当[经济鸟类学家](https://birdhistory.substack.com/p/economic-ornithology)研究此事时，他们发现猫在捕鸟方面“造成的破坏远大于在捕鼠方面所产生的好处。”
    他们断言每只“以种子为食的鸟”每年对农民的价值为一美元，并估计平均每只猫每年杀死五十只鸟。
- en: One of Forbush’s correspondents saw this tradeoff in action. He claimed to have
    a productive garden until new neighbors moved in with their six cats. “Last summer,
    he says, half the birds were killed. This year hardly one is left, and many spring
    migrants have disappeared. He never knew before that there could be so many destructive
    insects in a square foot.” This sort of account, multiplied across every farm
    and garden in the country, led bird-lovers to conclude that “the destruction of
    insectivorous birds by cats .. has an important bearing on the welfare of the

    of the cat-owning community. Cat-lovers were alarmed by conservationists who were
    “so rabidly hysterical on the subject of cats that they would have them all destroyed.”
    The cat-lovers retorted that cats were merely following their biological instincts,
    and that bird-lovers would change their position as soon as they saw their “pea-pods
    empty and the strawberry bed raped of fruit” by birds. Besides, they argued, cats
    had just as much to fear from birds. In 1920, the cat advocate Carl Van Vechten
    vividly described how a cruel eagle “swoops from the skies, seizes the cat along
    his spine with its terrible claws, mangles his head with its beak the while it
    flaps its gaunt and terrifying wings and bears the little beast aloft.”

- en: The complaints of cat lovers were not entirely baseless. There were conservationists,
    such as Eugene Davenport, who stated that “the sooner [domestic cats] could become
    extinct the better for our song birds on which we depend so much.” And many who
    did not call for complete extermination struck an adversarial tone. “No one has
    a right to keep a cat that becomes a nuisance in killing birds on his neighbor’s

  zh: 到了世纪之交，大多数美国大城市建立了人道社会。它们安乐死的猫的数量是惊人的。波士顿的动物救援联盟在1905年至1914年间摧毁了21万只猫，而纽约的美国防虐待动物协会在1911年单年内就杀死了303,949只“患病、受伤和无家可归的猫”。动物救援社会会将一些猫送到家庭中，但对于每一个送给爱心家庭的猫，还有一百只被摧毁。
- en: Humane societies did not round up cats out of a concern for birds, but bird-lovers
    frequently praised their work, which they used both as a demonstration of the
    scale of the cat problem and as a justification to kill cats themselves. Conservationists
    never killed cats at the scale of New York’s Society for the Prevention of Cruelty
    to Animals, but game wardens, sportsmen, and otherwise peaceable bird-lovers resolutely
    killed cats, sometimes by the dozen, in the defense of birds.

- en: At game preserves and sporting clubs, wardens killed any cats curious enough
    to come looking for quails or pheasants. One game warden brought his hunting dog
    with him to trail cats “and bay until a 22-caliber rifle comes to ‘do the rest.’”
    Another warden “found that the attacks of bull-dog-bite-itis to be more certainly
    and rapidly fatal to predatory cats than appendicitis.” At the Henry Ford farms
    in Dearborn, Michigan, wardens killed 75 cats a year. And in New York’s Central
    Park, a “man employed to guard the birds” killed 161 cats in the first six months
    of 1910.

  zh: 在野生动物保护区和运动俱乐部，看守员会杀死任何对鹌鹑或野鸡感兴趣的猫。一位看守员带着狗猎捕猫，“直到用22口径步枪‘完成剩余的事情’”。另一位看守员“发现与防狗猫病的攻击比阑尾炎更能确切迅速地致命”。在密歇根州迪尔伯恩的亨利·福特农场，看守员每年杀死75只猫。在纽约中央公园，一名“专门负责保护鸟类的人员”在1910年前六个月内杀死了161只猫。
- en: 'Farmers shot any cats caught lurking near the hen house, and some bird-lovers
    would kill any stray cat found traipsing through the garden. In this they had
    the support of the law. While deliberate cruelty was illegal, in most states cats
    were not considered property, but rather “a predatory animal which any person
    may destroy when found doing damage on his premises.”  Occasionally, repentant
    cat owners would even kill their own pets after learning how many birds they had
    destroyed. In a letter to the New York Times, one writer confessed: “On Saturday
    last our cat caught two young robins. Having tasted blood, she has developed the
    hunting instinct, and during the last week has caught and killed seven birds.
    Her funeral will take place Sunday afternoon.”'

  zh: 农民们会射杀任何在鸡舍附近潜伏的猫，而一些热爱鸟类的人士则会杀死任何在花园里闲逛的流浪猫。在这方面，他们得到了法律的支持。虽然蓄意虐待是违法的，但在大多数州，猫不被视为财产，而是“任何人在其财产上发现猫造成损害时可以消灭的掠食动物。”
    偶尔，悔改的猫主人甚至会在得知他们的宠物捕杀了多少只鸟后自己杀死它们。在一封致《纽约时报》的信中，一位作者坦白道：“上周六我们家的猫抓到了两只幼鸫。尝过鲜血后，它发展出了狩猎本能，在过去一周里捉到并杀死了七只鸟。它的葬礼将于周日下午举行。”
- en: Looking back at this era with a hundred years of hindsight, it does not seem
    that much has changed. Plenty of heated language can still be found from bird-lovers
    and cat-lovers, but most people, it seems, continue to prefer solutions that offer
    “just regards for the rights of people, birds and cats.” Unfortunately, this sort
    of resolution remains just as elusive as it was back then. The number of feral
    cats has only grown since 1916, and all signs indicate that the number of birds
    they kill has increased in stride.

  zh: 百年后回顾这个时代，似乎并没有太多改变。鸟类爱好者和猫科动物爱好者之间依然存在激烈的言论，但大多数人似乎仍然更喜欢提供“公正地尊重人类、鸟类和猫类的权利”的解决方案。不幸的是，这种解决方案仍然像过去一样难以实现。自1916年以来，野生猫的数量仅增不减，所有迹象表明它们杀死的鸟类数量也在同步增加。
- en: Estimates of the number of birds killed by cats have always been extremely speculative,
    and today these estimates are bigger than ever. In 1916, Gilbert Trafton claimed
    that 85 million birds were killed by cats every year east of the Mississippi.
    This figure pales in comparison to more recent approximations. A paper that appeared
    in *Nature* in 2013 put the number of birds killed by cats in North America at
    somewhere between 1.3 and 4.0 *billion* birds every year, a total that is mostly
    driven by unowned cats. If this figure were accurate — a big if — it would dwarf
    the toll of every other direct cause of human-driven bird mortality.

  zh: 估计猫杀死的鸟类数量一直都是极具推测性的，今天这些估计比以往任何时候都要大。1916年，吉尔伯特·特拉夫顿声称，密西西比河以东每年有8500万只鸟被猫杀死。这个数字与最近的近似值相形见绌。2013年发表在《自然》杂志上的一篇论文将北美地区每年被猫杀死的鸟类数量估计在13亿至40亿之间，这个总数主要由无主猫贡献。如果这个数字准确的话——这是一个很大的如果——那么它将超过所有其他人类驱使的直接鸟类死亡原因的总和。

    Loss, Tom Will, and Peter Marra estimate that cats kill 2.4 billion birds a year

    solutions to the bird-cat problem have only increased. The number of cats, both
    domestic and feral, has more than doubled since 1970\. Meanwhile, the number of
    birds in North America has [fallen by three billion](https://www.3billionbirds.org/)
    over the same period, driven by many causes, of which cats are just one. All the
    same, Robert Ridgeway’s words from 1915 seem just as relevant today: “It is of
    course difficult to estimate the extent to which these practically wild cats are
    responsible for the present relative scarcity of birds, but it must, from the
    very nature of the case, be a most important factor.”'

  zh: 在过去的一百年中，解决鸟类与猫之间的问题的人道和有效解决方案的重要性只增加不减。自1970年以来，无论是家养猫还是野生猫的数量都超过了两倍。与此同时，北美地区的鸟类数量在同一时期内减少了30亿只，受多种因素驱使，其中猫只是其中之一。尽管如此，罗伯特·里奇韦在1915年的话至今仍然适用：“当然很难估计这些几乎野生的猫对当前鸟类相对稀缺的程度有多大影响，但从事实本质来看，它必然是一个极其重要的因素。”
