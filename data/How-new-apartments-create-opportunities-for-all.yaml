    occupied by households on the higher end of the income spectrum, the chain of
    residential moves brought about by their construction benefits many more households.
    Today’s lower-priced rental housing was often the new, expensive rental housing
    of yesteryear. And it doesn’t take decades for new apartments to put downward
    pressure on rents elsewhere in a metropolitan area. New units help keep current
    prices down for everyone by opening up new opportunities for low- and moderate-income
    renters over a few short years through a chain of residential moves.

    Lower growth in a city’s housing supply leads to less filtering for *all* housing

    shows that filtering happens more slowly in places with more restrictions on construction.
    In places like San Francisco, filtering can even happen in reverse. When there
    are few homes relative to demand, older homes are more likely to be bought by
    higher-income households over time. This doesn’t just apply to Victorian-era mansions,
    but also to the less amenity-rich housing stock that used to be more accessible
