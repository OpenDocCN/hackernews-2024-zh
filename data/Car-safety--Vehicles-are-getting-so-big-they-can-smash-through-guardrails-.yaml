    of 5,000 pounds, but many of today’s SUVs and trucks exceed that threshold. A
    Cadillac Escalade, for instance, now weighs [over 6,200 pounds](https://media.cadillacarabia.com/media/us/en/cadillac/vehicles/escalade-v/2024.tab1.html),

    tip the scales at [almost 5,700 pounds](https://www.jdemmerford.com/research/new-ford-f-150-weight.htm).
    You don’t really want to hit a guardrail with a vehicle like that, but electrification
    can make things even dicier. Electric cars often weigh [around 30 percent](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/01/electric-vehicles-suv-battery-climate-safety/672576/)
    more than a gas-powered counterpart, because big vehicles require enormous batteries

    an MGS guardrail at 62 mph and a 25-degree angle, reflecting common highway crash

- en: The silver lining, Stolle told me, was that the Rivian seemed capable of protecting
    passengers in that test. “The damage to the interior of the vehicle was very low,”
    he said, “and the occupant risk in that scenario would not be cause for alarm.”
    But he noted that in the real world, a guardrail is much more likely to be placed
    next to a steep dropoff than a concrete barrier. If a car penetrates a guardrail
    and tumbles down an incline, passengers would face far greater danger.

    expenses that would drive the price tag much higher. (Retrofits could be less
