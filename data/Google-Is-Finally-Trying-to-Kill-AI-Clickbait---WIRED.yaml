    giant just announced [upcoming changes](https://developers.google.com/search/blog/2024/03/core-update-spam-policies),
    including a revamped spam policy, designed in part to keep AI clickbait out of
    its search results.

  zh: 谷歌正在采取行动对抗算法生成的垃圾邮件。这家搜索引擎巨头刚刚宣布[即将到来的变化](https://developers.google.com/search/blog/2024/03/core-update-spam-policies)，包括一项更新的垃圾邮件政策，部分设计目的是防止AI点击诱饵进入其搜索结果。

    the change will reduce “low-quality, unoriginal content” in search results by
    40 percent. It will focus on reducing what the company calls “scaled content abuse,”
    which is when bad actors flood the internet with massive amounts of articles and
    blog posts designed to game search engines.

- en: “A good example of it, which has been around for a little while, is the abuse
    around obituary spam,” says Google’s vice president of search, Pandu Nayak. [Obituary
    spam](https://www.wired.com/story/morbid-war-online-obituaries/) is an especially
    grim type of digital piracy, where people attempt to make money by scraping and
    republishing death notices, sometimes on social platforms like [YouTube](https://www.wired.com/story/youtube-obituary-pirates/).
    Recently, obituary spammers have started [using artificial intelligence](https://www.theverge.com/24065145/ai-obituary-spam-generative-clickbait)
    tools to increase their output, making the issue even worse. Google’s new policy,
    if enacted effectively, should make it harder for this type of spam to crop up
    in online searches.

  zh: “一个很好的例子，它已经存在一段时间了，是围绕讣告垃圾邮件的滥用”，谷歌搜索副总裁Pandu Nayak说道。[讣告垃圾邮件](https://www.wired.com/story/morbid-war-online-obituaries/)是一种特别严峻的数字盗版，人们试图通过擦取和重新发布死亡通知来赚钱，有时还会在社交平台上如[YouTube](https://www.wired.com/story/youtube-obituary-pirates/)上进行。最近，讣告垃圾邮件发送者开始使用[人工智能](https://www.theverge.com/24065145/ai-obituary-spam-generative-clickbait)工具来增加其产出，使问题变得更加严重。如果谷歌的新政策有效实施，应该会使这类垃圾邮件在在线搜索中更难出现。
- en: This notably more aggressive approach to combating search spam takes specific
    aim at “domain squatting,” a practice in which scavengers purchase websites with
    name recognition to profit off their reputations, often replacing original journalism
    with AI-generated articles designed to manipulate search engine rankings. This
    type of behavior predates the AI boom, but with the rise of text-generation tools
    like ChatGPT, it’s [become increasingly easy](https://www.wired.com/story/ai-generated-marketing-content/)
    to churn out endless articles to game Google rankings.

  zh: 这种更加积极的对抗搜索垃圾邮件的方法特别瞄准了“域名投机”，这是一种搜刮者购买具有名誉的网站以从中获利的做法，通常用AI生成的文章替换原创新闻，旨在操纵搜索引擎排名。这种行为类型在AI繁荣之前就存在，但随着像ChatGPT这样的文本生成工具的兴起，[变得越来越容易](https://www.wired.com/story/ai-generated-marketing-content/)生产无休止的文章来操控谷歌排名。

    Google Search’s reputation in recent years. “People can spin up these sites really
    easily,” says SEO expert Gareth Boyd, who runs the digital marketing firm Forte
    Analytica. “It’s been a big issue.” (Boyd admits that he has even created similar
    sites in the past, though he says he doesn’t do it anymore.)

  zh: 近年来，[域名抢注](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2023/09/google-search-size-usefulness-decline/675409/)的激增只是影响谷歌搜索声誉的诸多问题之一。“人们可以轻易地创建这些网站，”运营数字营销公司Forte
    Analytica的SEO专家加雷斯·博伊德表示，“这是一个重大问题。”（博伊德承认，他过去曾创建过类似的网站，尽管他现在不再这样做。）
- en: In February, WIRED reported on several [AI clickbait networks](https://www.wired.com/story/confessions-of-an-ai-clickbait-kingpin/)
    that used domain squatting as a strategy, including one that took the websites
    for the defunct indie women’s website [The Hairpin](https://www.wired.com/story/plaintext-hairpin-blog-ai-clickbait-farm/)
    and the shuttered Hong Kong-based pro-democracy tabloid [Apple Daily](https://www.wired.com/story/confessions-of-an-ai-clickbait-kingpin/)
    and filled them with AI-generated nonsense. Another [transformed the website of
    a small-town Iowa newspaper](https://www.wired.com/story/iowa-newspaper-website-ai-generated-clickbait-factory/)
    into a bizarro repository for AI blog posts on retail stocks. According to Google’s
    new policy, this type of behavior is now explicitly categorized by the company
    as spam.

  zh: 《连线》（WIRED）在二月份报导了几个利用域名抢注作为策略的[人工智能点击诱饵网络](https://www.wired.com/story/confessions-of-an-ai-clickbait-kingpin/)，其中包括一个利用了已停运的独立女性网站[The
    Hairpin](https://www.wired.com/story/plaintext-hairpin-blog-ai-clickbait-farm/)和关闭的香港民主报纸[《苹果日报》](https://www.wired.com/story/confessions-of-an-ai-clickbait-kingpin/)的网站，并填充了人工智能生成的无意义内容。另一个将一家小镇爱荷华州报纸的网站转变为人工智能博客文章关于零售股的反常存储库。根据谷歌的新政策，此类行为现在明确被公司归类为垃圾邮件。
- en: In addition to domain squatting, Google’s new policy will also focus on eliminating
    “reputation abuse,” where otherwise trustworthy websites allow third-party sources
    to publish janky sponsored content or other digital junk. (Google’s blog post
    describes “payday loan reviews on a trusted educational website” as an example.)
    While the other parts of the spam policy will start enforcement immediately, Google
    is giving 60 days notice prior to cracking down on reputational abuse, to give
    websites time to fall in line.

    of last year. More broadly, the company has been working on ways to fix low-quality
