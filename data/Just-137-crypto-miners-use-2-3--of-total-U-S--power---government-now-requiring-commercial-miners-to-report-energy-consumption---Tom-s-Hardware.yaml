- en: The U.S Energy Information Administration (EIA) is now requiring large-scale
    commercial cryptocurrency mining operations to report their power consumption.
    This initiative is part of a larger effort to regulate and penalize cryptocurrency
    mining due to the exorbitant amount of energy the industry consumes yearly. For
    now, the EIA is only collecting data, but this new data should give birth to new
    regulations that will penalize miners in the future. This comes as the company
    has [released a study](https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=61364)
    (first reported on by [*Inside Climate News*](https://insideclimatenews.org/news/06022024/todays-climate-cryptocurrency-energy-information-administration-energy-use-climate-change/))
    suggesting that cryptocurrency mining represents up to 2.3% of U.S. power demand.

  zh: 美国能源信息管理局（EIA）现在要求大规模商业加密货币挖矿运营报告其能耗。这一举措是规范和惩罚加密货币挖矿的更大努力的一部分，因为该行业每年消耗的能源数量庞大。目前，EIA只是在收集数据，但这些新数据应该会促成未来惩罚挖矿者的新规定。这一举措是在公司发布了一项研究后出现的，该研究首次由[*Inside
    Climate News*](https://insideclimatenews.org/news/06022024/todays-climate-cryptocurrency-energy-information-administration-energy-use-climate-change/)报道，该研究表明，加密货币挖矿占美国电力需求的高达2.3%。
- en: “We intend to continue to analyze and write about the energy implications of
    cryptocurrency mining activities in the United States...,” EIA administratior
    Joe DeCarolis [said in a release in January](https://www.eia.gov/pressroom/releases/press550.php).
    “We will specifically focus on how the energy demand for cryptocurrency mining
    is evolving, identify geographic areas of high growth, and quantify the sources
    of electricity used to meet cryptocurrency mining demand.”

  zh: “我们打算继续分析和撰写关于美国加密货币挖矿活动能源影响的文章……”，EIA管理者Joe DeCarolis在一月份的一份新闻稿中[说道](https://www.eia.gov/pressroom/releases/press550.php)。“我们将特别关注加密货币挖矿的能源需求如何演变，确定高增长地理区域，并量化满足加密货币挖矿需求的电力来源。”
- en: DeCarolis' words summarize that the United States will pay close attention to
    the environmental challenges cryptocurrency mining might be causing. We can surmise
    that the United States government specifically wants to crack down on mining operations
    that impact the reliability and sustainability of power in highly populated areas.
    Potentially leading to higher residential power costs and power shortage issues
    during peak hours. As of January 2024, the EIA has identified 137 cryptomining
    facilities.

  zh: DeCarolis的话总结了美国将密切关注加密货币挖矿可能带来的环境挑战。我们可以推测，美国政府特别希望打击影响人口密集地区电力可靠性和可持续性的挖矿活动。这可能导致住宅电力成本上升，并在高峰时段出现电力短缺问题。截至2024年1月，EIA已经确认了137个加密货币挖矿设施。

- en: The EIA found that crypto-mining operations in the United States has grown substantially
    over the past few years, to the point where all U.S-based crypto-mining operations
    consume 0.6% to 2.3% of the nation's entire electricity consumption alone. For
    comparison, the total U.S. Bitcoin mining industry consumes the annual power budget
    of Utah or West Virginia. The estimated power draw of Bitcoin mining worldwide
    is projected to be anywhere between 0.2% to 0.9% of global demand, equating to
    the same power draw as Greece or Australia by themselves.

  zh: 美国的加密货币挖矿操作在过去几年里显著增长，到了现在，所有美国境内的加密货币挖矿操作单独消耗了国家电力消耗的0.6%到2.3%。举例而言，美国的比特币挖矿行业的年度电力预算消耗相当于犹他州或西弗吉尼亚州的整体年度电力预算。全球比特币挖矿的估计电力消耗量预计将占全球需求的0.2%到0.9%，相当于希腊或澳大利亚单独的电力消耗。
- en: Bitcoin mining is very power-hungry in the United States specifically due to
    the exorbitant amount of mining that actually takes place within U.S borders.
    The EIA found that the global share of Bitcoin mining that takes place in the
    U.S. grew from 3.4% in 2020 to a whopping 37.8% in 2022.

  zh: 特别是由于在美国境内实际进行的大量挖矿，比特币挖矿在美国尤其耗电量巨大。美国能源信息署发现，2022年全球比特币挖矿在美国的份额从2020年的3.4%增长到了惊人的37.8%。
- en: The incredible power demands of the Bitcoin industry are a result of the Bitcoin
    mining algorithm becoming more and more difficult every single year. Bitcoin today
    isn't what it was eight to ten years ago, where you could mine it on a single
    computer and net a decent profit. Nowadays, Bitcoin needs to be mined on hundreds
    of specialized mining devices (ASICs) to be gathered at all. The continuous difficulty
    of the Bitcoin algorithm, in turn, creates higher and higher power costs as the
    cryptocurrency gets harder to mine.

  zh: 比特币行业的惊人能耗需求是比特币挖矿算法每年变得越来越困难的结果。今天的比特币已不同于八到十年前，当时你可以在一台电脑上挖矿并获得不错的利润。如今，比特币需要在数百台专业的挖矿设备（ASICs）上挖掘才能采集。比特币算法的持续困难反过来导致随着加密货币的挖掘变得越来越困难，电力成本也越来越高。

    2024 is expected to be one of the most eventful years in Bitcoin history, with
    the cryptocurrency expected to blow past its record $69,000 high sometime after
    its halving event in April (when the reward for Bitcoin mining is cut in half)
    thanks to reduced mining profit and large-scale institutional adoption.
