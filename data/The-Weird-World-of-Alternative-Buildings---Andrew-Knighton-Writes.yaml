  zh: 写我新故事《风雨避难所》最有趣的事情之一就是探索替代建筑材料的世界。
- en: This is something I first got interested in while working on a different (currently
    unpublished) story last year. It turns out that a lot of work is being done on
    alternatives to bricks and concrete. There are a bunch of reasons for this, including
    the fact that concrete is incredibly carbon intensive to produce. But ultimately,
    it feels like the main motivation is that they’re just kind of cool.

  zh: 这是我去年在撰写另一个（目前尚未出版）故事时首次对此产生兴趣的事情。事实证明，对砖和混凝土的替代品正在进行大量研究。其中有很多原因，包括混凝土生产的碳排放量非常高。但最终，感觉主要动机只是因为它们真的很酷。
- en: There are people experimenting with bricks of compacted rubble and rubbish.
    There are reinforcement bars made from hemp. There are people returning to the
    10,000-year-old material called cob. And yes, for real, there are experiments
    in growing buildings out of fungus. Combining that with spider silk was my own
    idea, as far as I know—perhaps some cunning engineer beat me to it, and I just
    haven’t read their work yet.

  zh: 有人正在尝试用压实的碎石和垃圾制作砖块。有人用大麻制作钢筋。有人重新回到一种有一万年历史的叫做cob的材料。而且，是真的，有人正在尝试用真菌建造建筑物。将这与蜘蛛丝结合起来是我自己的想法，据我所知——也许一些狡猾的工程师已经先我一步，我只是还没有阅读过他们的作品。
- en: Lots of these experiments will go nowhere. The materials won’t be strong enough,
    durable enough, or sustainable enough for widespread use. Some perfectly good
    ones might be abandoned for perfectly bad business reasons. But they don’t all
    need to succeed for the experiments to be worthwhile. If just a few prove productive,
    then they could help us to build in newer, better, more interesting and varied
    ways.

  zh: 很多这些实验都会走进死胡同。材料可能不够强，不够耐用，或者不够可持续以供广泛使用。有些本来不错的实验可能因为完全糟糕的商业原因而被抛弃。但并不是所有的实验都需要成功才能有价值。如果只有少数实验证明是有效的，那么它们也可以帮助我们以更新、更好、更有趣和更多样化的方式进行建设。
- en: The important thing, for scifi writers as much as for architects and builders,
    is to get out of familiar patterns of thinking, to look at alternatives. Why should
    every future city be a place of concrete, glass, and steel? Why couldn’t it be
    grown from sunflowers, woven by insects, raised from lava flows? Perhaps it could
    be built considering the complete life cycles of buildings, assuming that the
    building will one day replaced, and planning for what will happen to its parts.
    Maybe a single city could use hundreds of different approaches, as varied as the
    people living in it.

  zh: 对于科幻作家和建筑师、建筑者来说，重要的是摆脱熟悉的思维模式，看看其他选择。为什么每个未来城市都必须是由混凝土、玻璃和钢铁构成的地方呢？为什么不能是由向日葵生长、由昆虫编织、由熔岩流产生的呢？也许可以考虑建筑物的完整生命周期，假设建筑物将来会被取代，并计划其零部件将会发生的事情。也许一个城市可以使用数百种不同的方法，就像生活在其中的人们一样多样化。
- en: Not every story needs to have novel buildings—too much novelty can distract
    from your core idea. But if you’re looking for something different to build your
    story out of, then maybe look into alternative homes and the materials they’re
    made from. At the very least, you’ll be entertained.

  zh: 并不是每个故事都需要有新颖的建筑——太多的新颖可能会让核心思想变得模糊。但如果你想要一些不同的构建材料，那么也许可以研究一下替代住房和它们所用的材料。至少，你会感到有趣。
