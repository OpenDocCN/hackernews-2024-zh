    States. [According to estimates from Kelley Blue Book](https://www.coxautoinc.com/market-insights/q4-2023-ev-sales/),
    more EVs were sold last year than were sold between 2011 and 2018\. The roughly
    1.2 million new EVs put into service in 2023 represented 7.6% of the total U.S.
    car market. Cox Automotive’s Economics and Industry Insights team boldly [predicted](https://www.coxautoinc.com/market-insights/q4-2023-ev-sales/)
    that this share will climb to 10% in 2024.

- en: However, these studies (and there are many) are only as reliable as their completeness.
    After all, a wide variety of expenses factor into a vehicle’s lifetime cost, and
    excluding or miscalculating one could drastically skew the calculation. That’s
    why researchers at the University of Michigan’s Center for Sustainable Systems
    reviewed the dozens of “total cost of ownership” studies to craft their own. Published
    on January 3rd in the *Journal of Industrial Ecology*, their [analysis](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jiec.13463)

- en: The findings broadly challenge the optimistic cost-of-ownership assessments
    frequently touted by EV enthusiasts. The researchers found that while small and
    low-range EVs capable of traveling around 200 miles are indeed less expensive
    to own than their gas-powered counterparts, larger, long-range EVs that can cover
    400 miles are more expensive. Midsize SUV EVs — currently the top-selling models
    by far — only reach cost parity if government incentives are applied.

  zh: 这些发现在很大程度上挑战了经常被电动汽车爱好者们宣扬的乐观的拥有成本评估。研究人员发现，虽然能够行驶约200英里的小型和低续航里程电动汽车确实比其汽油动力对手更便宜，但是能够行驶400英里的更大型、长续航里程的电动汽车则更昂贵。中型SUV电动汽车——目前迄今为止销量最高的车型——只有在政府提供激励措施的情况下才能达到成本平价。
- en: “EVs are more competitive in cities with high gasoline prices, low electricity
    prices, moderate climates, and direct purchase incentives, and for users with
    home charging access, time-of-use electricity pricing, and high annual mileage,”

- en: 'Since EVs are broadly more expensive to purchase upfront than comparable gas
    vehicles, the best way to assess whether an EV will ultimately be cheaper to own
    over the long term is by looking at its break-even time: when its lower recurring
    costs make up for its higher upfront cost. Woody and his team found that 200-mile
    range compact and midsize electric sedans reach this point in 3 to 7 years, while
    300-mile range variants take nine to 20 years to break even. Electric SUVs and
    trucks with 300 miles of range generally take more than 20 years, while 400-mile
    range EVs will never break even over their lifetimes.'

  zh: 由于电动汽车的初始购买成本通常比同类汽油车更昂贵，因此评估电动汽车是否从长远来看更便宜的最佳方法是查看其盈亏平衡时间：即较低的重复成本弥补其较高的初始成本的时间点。伍迪及其团队发现，具有200英里行驶里程的紧凑型和中型电动轿车在3至7年内达到这一点，而300英里行驶里程的变体需要9至20年才能盈亏平衡。拥有300英里行驶里程的电动SUV和卡车通常需要超过20年的时间，而具有400英里行驶里程的电动汽车在使用寿命内永远无法实现盈亏平衡。

    credit, which reduces the purchase price of [certain EVs](https://www.consumerreports.org/cars/hybrids-evs/electric-cars-plug-in-hybrids-that-qualify-for-tax-credits-a7820795671/)

- en: “For 200-mile range BEVs, the breakeven time is under 2 years for compact vehicles
    and sedans, and under 5 years for small and midsize SUVs in each city,” the researchers
    reported. “Small 300-mile range vehicles break even in under 10 years in each
    city, and larger 300-mile range vehicles break even in under 10 years in many
    cities…there are a few cities in which 400-mile BEV compact and midsize sedans

- en: Overall, the greatest factor in determining whether an EV will be cheaper to
    own than a gas vehicle is the ability to charge at home, where electricity is
    cheapest. (In their analysis, the researchers assumed that EV owners charge at
    home 80% of the time and at public charging stations 20% of the time.) Without
    home charging, an EV will likely never be cheaper over its lifetime.
