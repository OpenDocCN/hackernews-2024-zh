- en: In a world without partisan politics, the Cass report on youth gender medicine
    would prompt serious reflection from American trans-rights activists, their supporters
    in the media, and the doctors and institutions offering hormonal and surgical
    treatments to minors. At the request of the English National Health Service, the
    senior pediatrician Hilary Cass has completed the most thorough consideration
    yet of this field, and her report calmly and carefully demolishes many common
    activist tropes. Puberty blockers *do* have side effects, Cass found. The evidence
    base for widely used treatments is “[shaky](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/apr/10/gender-medicine-built-on-shaky-foundations-cass-review-finds).”
    Their safety and effectiveness are not settled science.

  zh: 在一个没有党派政治的世界中，Cass关于青少年性别医学的报告将引发美国跨性别权利活动人士、他们在媒体上的支持者以及向未成年人提供激素和手术治疗的医生和机构进行严肃反思。在英国国民健康服务的请求下，资深儿科医生希拉里·卡斯完成了迄今为止对这一领域进行的最彻底考虑，她的报告冷静而仔细地打破了许多常见的活动人士说法。卡斯发现，青春期阻断剂确实有副作用。广泛使用的治疗方法的证据基础是“[摇摇欲坠](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/apr/10/gender-medicine-built-on-shaky-foundations-cass-review-finds)”。它们的安全性和有效性并非已经确立的科学事实。
- en: The report drew on extensive interviews with doctors, parents, and young people,
    as well as on a series of new, systematic literature reviews. Its publication
    marks a decisive turn away from the affirmative model of treatment, [in line](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2023/04/gender-affirming-care-debate-europe-dutch-protocol/673890/)
    with similar moves in other European countries. What Cass’s [final document](https://cass.independent-review.uk/home/publications/final-report/)
    finds, largely, is an *absence*. “The reality is that we have no good evidence
    on the long-term outcomes of interventions to manage gender-related distress,”
    Cass writes. We also don’t have strong evidence that social transitioning, such
    as changing names or pronouns, affects adolescents’ mental-health outcomes (either
    positively or negatively). We don’t have strong evidence that puberty blockers
    are merely a pause button, or that their benefits outweigh their downsides, or
    that they are lifesaving care in the sense that they prevent suicides. We don’t
    know why the number of children turning up at gender clinics rose so dramatically
    during the 2010s, or why the demographics of those children changed from a majority
    of biological males to a majority of biological females. Neither “born that way”
    nor “it’s all social contagion” captures the complexity of the picture, Cass writes.

- en: 'What Cass does feel confident in saying is this: When it comes to alleviating
    gender-related distress, “for the majority of young people, a medical pathway
    may not be the best way to achieve this.” That conclusion will now inform the
    creation of new state-provided services in England. These will attempt to consider
    patients more holistically, acknowledging that their gender distress might be
    part of a picture that also includes anxiety, autism, obsessive-compulsive disorder,
    eating disorders, or past trauma.'

- en: This is a million miles away from prominent American medical groups’ recommendation
    to simply *affirm* an adolescent’s stated gender—and from common practice at American
    gender clinics. For example, a [Reuters investigation](https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-transyouth-care/)
    found that, of 18 U.S. clinics surveyed, none conducted the lengthy psychological
    assessments used by Dutch researchers who pioneered the use of medical gender
    treatments in adolescents; some clinics prescribe puberty blockers or hormones
    during a patient’s first visit. Under pressure from its members, the American
    Academy of Pediatrics last year commissioned its own evidence review, which is
    still in progress. But at the same time, the group [restated](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/03/health/aap-gender-affirming-care-evidence-review.html)

    repeated across multiple stories, to assure its audience that “gender-affirming

    about the benefits of youth gender medicine, doctors with direct experience in
    the field are divided, particularly outside the United States. “Clinicians who
    have spent many years working in gender clinics have drawn very different conclusions
    from their clinical experience about the best way to support young people with
    gender-related distress,” Cass writes. Her report is a challenge to the latest
    standards of care from the U.S.-based World Professional Association for Transgender
    Health, which [declined](https://www.bmj.com/content/bmj/378/bmj.o2303.full.pdf)
    to institute minimum-age limits for surgery. The literature review included with
    her report is notably brutal about these guidelines, which are highly influential
    in youth gender medicine in America and around the world—but which, according

- en: The crux of the report is that the ambitions of youth gender medicine outstripped
    the evidence—or, as Cass puts it, that doctors at the U.K. clinic whose practices
    she was examining, although well-meaning, “developed a fundamentally different
    philosophy and approach compared to other paediatric and mental health services.”
    How, she asks, did the medical pathway of puberty blockers and then cross-sex
    hormones—a treatment based on a [single Dutch study](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0092623X.2022.2121238)
    in the 1990s—spread around the world so quickly and decisively? Why didn’t clinicians

- en: The answer to those first two questions is the same. Medicalized gender treatments
    for minors became wrapped up with a push for wider social acceptance for transgender
    people, something that was presented as the “[next frontier](https://time.com/magazine/us/135460/june-9th-2014-vol-183-no-22-u-s/)
    in civil rights,” as *Time* magazine once described it. Any questions about such
    care were therefore read as stemming from transphobic hostility, full stop. And
    when those questions kept coming anyway, right-wing politicians and anti-woke
    comedians piled on, sensing an area where left-wing intellectuals were out of
    touch with popular opinion. In turn, that allowed misgivings to be dismissed as
    “[fascism](https://www.theatlantic.com/books/archive/2024/03/judith-butler-whos-afraid-of-gender/677874/),”
    even though, as the British journalist Sarah Ditum has written, “it is not damning
    of feminists that they are on the same page as Vladimir Putin about there being
    two sexes. That is just how many sexes there are.”
