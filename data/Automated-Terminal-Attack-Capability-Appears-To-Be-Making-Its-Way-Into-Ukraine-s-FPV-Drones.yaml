    drones successfully attacking a Russian target on the battlefield aided by automated
    targeting technology. While this kind of capability still appears limited, the
    conflict is seeing rapid progress in this area, as we outlined in [our previous

    view (FPV) drone engaging a Russian tank without the operator being in the loop
    during the last moments of its flight. The tank is on the edge of a tree line
    in the daytime but the distance between the tank and the drone that’s filming
    the engagement means it’s not possible to see details of the attacking drone,
    which appears to strike the turret, triggering a secondary explosion.

- en: “Our drones have evolved and are now able to hit targets almost independently!”
    Sternenko declared on X. “The drone flew to the target in the conditions of active

    and scaled up,” before requesting donations to fund “1,300+ such drones and invest

    us to beat the enemy even more effectively,” Sternenko says, before adding that
    there are plans to include the same technology in both FPV quadcopters and aircraft-like

  zh: 在这两种情况下，这些说法似乎有些夸大。
- en: What we are seeing in each case is the use of autopilot to maintain the drone’s
    course toward its target after the command link with its operator is degraded
    or broken during the terminal phase of an attack. This could also include a form
    of automated terminal guidance, actually automonously guiding onto an object that
    is locked onto by the controller, greatly improving its ability to complete its
    attack, but it's not clear if this level of sophistication is even present here.

  zh: 在每种情况下，我们看到的是使用自动驾驶仪在指挥链与操作者的连接在攻击的终端阶段降级或中断后，维持无人机向目标的航线。这可能还包括一种自动终端引导形式，实际上是通过控制器锁定的对象自主引导到其上，极大地提高了其完成攻击任务的能力，但目前尚不清楚这种复杂程度是否存在。
- en: This would help mitigate the effects of highly localized jamming, in particular
    electronic warfare systems on the targeted vehicles themselves that are becoming
    highly prevalent. But this capability would be just as important in addressing
    line-of-sight communications issues with these types of drones as they fly very
    close to the ground during their attack runs.

  zh: 这将有助于减轻高度局部干扰的影响，特别是电子战系统对目标车辆本身的影响日益普遍。但这种能力在处理视距通信问题时同样重要，尤其是在这些无人机进行攻击时非常接近地面的情况下。
- en: Using short-range FPV drones, a human operator has to manually fly (or at least
    guide) the weapon in real time and choose its target, and then manually fly into
    it. For the engagement to be successful, this guidance principle relies on a continuous
    line-of-sight datalink between the drone and its controller. The effects of localized
    jamming or the drone flying at a lower level amongst ground clutter and terrain
    can severely degrade or outright breaking that link. The farther the drones travel
    from their controlling party, the line-of-sight issues can become more pronounced.
    We often see the feeds of FPV drones becoming patchy or cutting out entirely just
    before they impact their targets. Once again, you can read all about these operational
    limitations and how AI and automation can get around them in [our special feature
    linked here](https://www.twz.com/news-features/drone-warfares-terrifying-ai-enabled-next-step-is-imminent).

  zh: 使用短程FPV无人机，人类操作员必须实时手动飞行（或至少引导）武器，并选择其目标，然后手动将其飞向目标。为了确保交战成功，此引导原则依赖于无人机与其控制器之间持续的视距数据链路。局部干扰或无人机在地面杂乱和地形中低空飞行可能会严重降低或完全打破这种连接。无人机离其控制方越远，视距问题就可能变得更加显著。我们经常看到FPV无人机的视频信号变得不稳定或完全中断，正好在它们撞击目标之前。您可以在[这里链接的我们的专题报道](https://www.twz.com/news-features/drone-warfares-terrifying-ai-enabled-next-step-is-imminent)中详细了解这些操作上的限制以及如何通过AI和自动化来解决它们。

- en: Using an autopilot to bring the drone to its last known flight vector would
    require only a very limited form of automation and could be somewhat effective
    for the kinds of static targets we see in both these videos. One where the drone
    locks onto a target and then flies its final attack run autonomously would be
    far more capable and could potentially hit moving targets.

- en: As the Switchblade attacks its target a special autopilot takes over to complete
    its terminal run. This allows for the engagement of targets more reliably and
    for the weapon to hit moving ones with greater accuracy even in denser terrain
    where line-of-sight is not assured. You can read more about how the system works [in
