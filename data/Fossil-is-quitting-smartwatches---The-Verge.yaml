  zh: Fossil Group 已决定退出智能手表。
- en: The company announced this afternoon that it would leave the smartwatch business
    and redirect resources to its less-smart goods instead. The company has been one
    of the most prolific makers of Wear OS smartwatches over the years, and its absence
    will leave a large gap in the market.

  zh: 该公司在今天下午宣布将退出智能手表业务，并将资源重新投向其较不智能的产品。多年来，该公司一直是 Wear OS 智能手表最多产的制造商之一，其退出将在市场上留下巨大的空白。
- en: '“As the smartwatch landscape has evolved significantly over the past few years,
    we have made the strategic decision to exit the smartwatch business,” Jeff Boyer,
    Fossil executive vice President and chief operating officer, tells *The Verge*.
    “Fossil Group is redirecting resources to support our core strength and the core
    segments of our business that continue to provide strong growth opportunities
    for us: designing and distributing exciting traditional watches, jewelry, and
    leather goods under our own as well as licensed brand names.”'

  zh: “随着智能手表市场在过去几年里发生了显著变化，我们已经做出了退出智能手表业务的战略决定，”Fossil 执行副总裁兼首席运营官 Jeff Boyer 告诉
    *The Verge*。“Fossil Group 正在重新调整资源，以支持我们的核心优势和我们业务的核心细分市场，这些细分市场仍然为我们提供了强劲的增长机会：在我们自己以及授权品牌名下设计和分销令人兴奋的传统手表、珠宝和皮具。”
- en: This means that the Gen 6, which [first launched in 2021](/22764448/fossil-gen-6-smartwatch-review),
    will be the last Fossil smartwatch. Boyer says the company will continue to keep
    existing Wear OS watches updated “for the next few years.”

  zh: 这意味着 [2021 年首次推出的](/22764448/fossil-gen-6-smartwatch-review) Gen 6 将是最后一款 Fossil
    智能手表。Boyer 表示该公司将继续更新现有的 Wear OS 手表“未来几年”。
- en: This shouldn’t come as a huge shock if you’ve been paying attention to Fossil
    the past few months. Some [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/WearOS/comments/18js0zt/there_will_be_no_new_fossil_gen7/)
    users had been reporting Fossil retail employees as saying Fossil was pulling
    out of the business, while others on the platform claiming “insider” knowledge
    said the company was [waiting for a new chipset](https://www.reddit.com/r/WearOS/comments/18js0zt/comment/kdnjd1w/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3).
    The company regularly put out smartwatches through Wear OS’s toughest years and
    was often a permanent fixture at CES. However, the company was notably absent
    from the show earlier this month. What’s more, Fossil was expected to announce
    news of a new Gen 7 featuring the [Qualcomm Snapdragon W5 Plus](/2022/7/19/23268272/qualcomm-snapdragon-w5-wearables-processor)
    platform in 2023 — however, it was nothing but crickets the entire year. Well,
    now we know why.

  zh: 如果你在过去几个月关注 Fossil，这并不会让你感到很震惊。一些 [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/WearOS/comments/18js0zt/there_will_be_no_new_fossil_gen7/)
    用户报告称 Fossil 的零售员工表示 Fossil 将退出该业务，而其他人则声称拥有“内幕”知识的人士表示该公司正在等待 [新的芯片组](https://www.reddit.com/r/WearOS/comments/18js0zt/comment/kdnjd1w/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)。该公司经常推出智能手表，即使在
    Wear OS 最困难的时期也是如此，并且通常是 CES 的固定展商。然而，该公司在本月初的展会上明显缺席。更重要的是，据预计 Fossil 将在 2023
    年宣布采用 [高通骁龙 W5 Plus](/2022/7/19/23268272/qualcomm-snapdragon-w5-wearables-processor)
    平台的新一代 7，但整整一年都没有任何消息。现在我们知道原因了。
