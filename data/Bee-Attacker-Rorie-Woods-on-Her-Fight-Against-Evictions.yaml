    when sheriff’s deputies arrived at 49 Memery Lane. It would have been a perfect
    fall day but for the unpleasant business at hand: the eviction of Alton King Jr.,
    a 79-year-old retiree who had lived at the address for decades. He’d spent the
    past few years fighting foreclosure, and in a last-ditch effort to save his sprawling
    home, he was at the courthouse that morning to ask a judge for a stay. The battle
    had garnered the attention of local activists devoted to fighting unlawful foreclosures,
    and a handful of them were outside at his house to protest. The deputies were
    waiting for King to return when a blue SUV with a landscaping trailer peeled into
    the driveway.'

- en: Rorie Woods stepped out from behind the wheel and walked to the rear of the
    trailer, which carried a half-dozen wooden boxes. With a pair of reading glasses
    draped around the collar of her purple fleece, she began to shake the boxes, because
    with the temperature in the low 50s, it was too cold for the honeybees inside
    to fly without a little coaxing. A deputy, realizing what she was about to unleash,
    tried to stop her, but a bee stung him in the face, forcing him to retreat. The
    maneuver bought Woods enough time to pull on a beekeeper suit with a vented hood
    that covered her face and roll one of the hives off the trailer and up to the
    entryway of King’s house. Three more officers marched forward to stop her, but
    they too were stung by the cloud of bees and fell back. Nearly 30 minutes later,
    one officer managed to handcuff her as the protesters cheered. “We’re with you,
    Rorie!” one yelled. She called back to another, telling her to take care of Zekie,
    her Chihuahua-basenji mix that had been sitting in her vehicle as the chaos unfolded.
    As the officer led Woods to a cruiser, he told her that he and several officers
    were allergic to bees. “Oh you’re allergic, good,” she allegedly replied.

- en: 'Generally, there are three markets for mortgages: prime, subprime, and predatory.
    Lenders in the predatory market have historically targeted vulnerable borrowers,
    offering loans with unfair or burdensome terms that can set victims down the road
    to financial hardship. In 2005, Woods was working as a home-remodeling contractor,
    and amid the housing boom fueled by easy lending, she took out a mortgage for
    a four-bedroom Colonial across from the Hadley Town Commons in Western Massachusetts.
    Soon after, she mortgaged another home, a rental property down the street. The
    following year, she was injured on a job, fell behind on both of her mortgage
    payments, and filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in order to avoid foreclosure. Woods
    claims that one of her mortgages was a subprime mortgage dressed up to look like
    a prime mortgage that was designed to lead to foreclosure. Her other mortgage,
    she says, was discriminatory because it referred to her as “a single woman.” She’s
    never filed a lawsuit challenging the loans, only calling them predatory as part
    of her defense in foreclosure proceedings.'

  zh: 一般来说，抵押贷款有三个市场：优质贷款、次级贷款和掠夺性贷款。掠夺性市场的放贷者历来瞄准脆弱的借款人，提供带有不公平或沉重条款的贷款，可能使受害者陷入财务困境。2005年，伍兹作为家居改造承包商工作，在由宽松贷款推动的住房繁荣中，她为马萨诸塞西部哈德利市镇广场对面的一栋四卧室殖民地房屋抵押了一笔贷款。不久之后，她又抵押了另一处房产，这是一栋位于街对面的出租物业。次年，她在工作中受伤，拖欠了两笔抵押贷款，最终申请了第7章破产以避免被强制执行。伍兹声称她的其中一笔抵押贷款是伪装成优质贷款的次级贷款，旨在导致强制执行。她说她的另一笔抵押贷款是歧视性的，因为其中称她为“单身女性”。她从未提起过挑战这些贷款的诉讼，只是在遭遇强制执行诉讼中将其称为掠夺性贷款的一部分作为她的辩护。

    and contracting jobs had dried up, so Woods made a full-time job out of her old
    hobby: beekeeping. Inspired by the work of Charles Mraz, a Vermont honeybee farmer
    who was the leading voice for the therapeutic use of bee stings to treat autoimmune
    diseases, she had begun keeping bees in the early 1990s, hoping that she could
    one day use them to treat all sorts of ailments. She kept a few hives but considered
    it a hobby, never really using them for therapeutic purposes. During the Great
    Recession, she increased her hive production and found that the gift economy among
    farmers in the Pioneer Valley was bountiful. She’d exchange honey for sausages,
    thick-cut bacon, or cases of blueberries. “It wasn’t terribly lucrative, but it
    did afford me an excellent quality of life,” she said. “That quality of life has
    been destroyed by this wrongful predatory loan, wrongful foreclosure, the wrongful
    evictions.”'

  zh: 到了2008年，[房地产泡沫破灭了](https://nymag.com/realestate/features/58873/)，建筑工作也变得稀缺，因此伍兹把她的旧爱好——养蜂——变成了全职工作。受到查尔斯·姆拉兹的工作启发，他是一位佛蒙特州的蜜蜂养殖者，也是治疗自身免疫疾病用蜜蜂蜇的主要倡导者，她从1990年代初开始养蜂，希望有朝一日能用它们治疗各种疾病。她养了几个蜂箱，但一直把它当作一种爱好，并未真正用来治疗。在大萧条期间，她增加了蜂巢的生产，并发现在先锋谷农民之间的礼物经济非常丰盛。她会用蜜换香肠、厚切培根或一箱蓝莓。“这并不是特别赚钱，但确实让我过上了优质的生活，”她说。“这种生活质量已经被这种错误的掠夺性贷款、错误的银行强制执行和错误的驱逐所摧毁。”

- en: Over the next decade, Woodsmanaged to stall the foreclosures of her properties
    by filing appeals, challenging the validity of her mortgages, and once again filing
    for bankruptcy. But in early 2018, Goldman Sachs foreclosed on Woods’s rental
    property and, five months later, Wells Fargo foreclosed on her Colonial, which
    a couple bought at auction. Although she fought both foreclosures, that July,
    sheriff’s deputies forced her out. She would remain homeless for years, sometimes
    living in a tent. Though most of her beehives weren’t on the property, Woods sought
    damages related to her bees, claiming the havoc the eviction wrought on her life
    precipitated the collapse of many of her hives. Throughout the process, Woods,
    who has a degree in documentary filmmaking from Hampshire College, steeped herself
    in property law. By her own tally, she’s been involved in 46 cases to date, and
    she’s represented herself in many of those cases, including an appeal to the Supreme
    Court. Discussing the cases, she speaks in unbroken paragraphs, calling on case
    law, mentioning relevant rulings or judges’ names without missing a beat. Once,
    after Woods made a long, deeply researched argument in front of a judge, even
    the opposing counsel, an attorney for a moving company that handled her belongings
    during her eviction, seemed impressed. “Your honor, as you just heard, she is
    highly intelligent,” he said.

  zh: 在接下来的十年里，伍兹通过提起上诉、质疑她的抵押贷款的有效性，并再次申请破产，成功拖延了她房产的被迫执行。但在2018年初，高盛银行强制执行了伍兹的租赁房产，五个月后，富国银行又对她的殖民地进行了强制执行，这所房产在拍卖会上被一对夫妇购买。尽管她反对了这两起强制执行，但在当年七月，警长的副手们还是把她赶了出去。她将在接下来的几年里一直无家可归，有时住在帐篷里。尽管她的大部分蜂箱并不在这些房产上，伍兹仍寻求与她的蜜蜂相关的损害赔偿，声称驱逐带来的混乱加速了她许多蜂箱的崩溃。在整个过程中，拥有汉普郡学院纪录片制作学位的伍兹深入研究了财产法。根据她自己的统计，迄今为止，她已参与了46起案件，并在其中许多案件中代表自己，包括向最高法院提起上诉。在讨论这些案件时，她一口气说完，引用案例法，提及相关裁决或法官的名字，丝毫不差。有一次，在伍兹在法官面前进行了长时间的深入研究论证后，甚至对立方案的律师，即处理她驱逐期间财产的搬运公司的律师，似乎也感到印象深刻。“法官，正如您刚才听到的，她非常聪明，”他说。

    Lending, a statewide coalition of organizations assisting people who have faced
    foreclosure. That’s where she met King, who was fighting to keep the 9,563-square-foot
    home he built in 2002\. In 2006, King, a financial adviser and entrepreneur, received
    a construction loan to add an indoor basketball court to the house. According
    to King, that loan came with a negative amortization rate that he was unaware
    of until he saw his mortgage payments go from $3,200 to $13,400 over the next
    few years. “I got sucked into one of the worst predatory loans anybody has ever
    heard of,” he said, believing he was given the loan because he is Black. Like
    Woods, King, once he realized he might be evicted, looked to MAAPL for support.
    He joined weekly phone calls with as many as 20 people to exchange information
    and ideas about their cases. “We started to realize in our loose organization
    of people who are the wrongfully foreclosed, ‘Oh, we all were set up!’” Woods
    said. “We like to show up for each other in court and to show moral support. We
    often will read each other’s filings just as a second set of eyes to make sure
    that we haven’t misargued something or stated something twice.”

    The Hampden County Sheriff’s Department had spent the past year evicting people
    at a rate of two or three per day, according to a recent [New York *Times*](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/18/us/evictions-pandemic.html)
    profile of Sheriff Nicholas Cocchi that focused on his efforts to make the process
    of eviction easier on people during the pandemic. After refusing a notice by deputies
    to vacate, King received a second notice to leave within 48 hours. Woods accompanied
    him to look at the facility where his belongings would be taken. The morning of
    his eviction, he went to the courthouse to appeal for a last-minute stay. He was
    unsuccessful, and, to his surprise, when he returned to 49 Memery Lane, a sheriff’s
    deputy told him that Woods had been arrested for the bee attack.

    co-founder of MAAPL, seemed to tell another story: Woods was always moving her
    bees around after she was evicted, and “Al had said, ‘Bring them to my house.’
    But she certainly shouldn’t have tried to unload them while there were sheriffs
