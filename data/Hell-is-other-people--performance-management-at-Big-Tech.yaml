- en: I spent a fair portion of my adult life working for large tech companies. In
    all my interactions with peers, no other topic caused as much cynicism and angst
    as the question of performance management — that is, the labyrinthine processes
    the companies follow to decide who to fire and who to reward for exemplary work.

  zh: 我的大部分成年生活都在大型科技公司工作。在我与同事的所有互动中，没有任何一个话题像绩效管理那样引起了如此多的愤世嫉俗和焦虑——也就是说，公司为了决定谁被解雇，谁因出色工作而获得奖励而遵循的曲折程序。
- en: 'Much of this anxiety arises from the belief that Big Tech wants to instill
    a cutthroat environment where you’re always compelled to do your best. I don’t
    think that’s true: in rapidly growing companies with easy access to funding, there
    is no intrinsic incentive to fire mediocre staff. The process is stressful to
    managers, legally risky, and harmful to morale. The loss of institutional knowledge
    is a problem, too. The tendency to accumulate slack is precisely why profitable
    tech companies panic and go through overdue layoffs whenever the economic outlook
    turns for the worse.'

  zh: 这种焦虑大部分源自一个信念，即大科技公司希望灌输一种你总是被迫做到最好的激烈竞争环境。我不认为这是真的：在快速增长的公司中，资金易于获取，没有内在的动机来解雇平庸的员工。这个过程对经理人来说是很有压力的，法律风险很高，对士气有害。机构知识的流失也是一个问题。累积懒散的倾向正是为什么盈利的科技公司在经济前景转差时会恐慌并进行过期的裁员。
- en: The actual reason for performance management is that your employees are sticklers
    for fairness. The exact dollar figure on your paycheck matters a lot less than
    knowing there’s another person who does less and somehow earns more. As a manager,
    in a good proportion of 1:1s, you hear your subordinates comparing themselves
    to others and asking you to explain any perceived slights. Harboring low performers
    has corrosive effects on team dynamics — doubly so in places that attract talent
    through the mythos of only hiring the best.

  zh: 进行绩效管理的实际原因是你的员工对公平非常在意。你的工资支票上的确切数字远不及知道有其他人做得更少，却以某种方式赚得更多。作为一个经理，在很大一部分的一对一谈话中，你会听到你的下属将自己与他人进行比较，并要求你解释任何感知上的冷落。对低绩效者的容忍会对团队动态产生腐蚀性影响——在通过只招聘最优秀的人这种神话吸引人才的地方，这种影响会加倍。
- en: 'For a long time, the prevailing corporate approach to performance management
    was to let the manager decide. After all, they had the expertise and the familiarity
    with the problem space, so it was believed that they’re best equipped to dole
    out punishment and deliver rewards. But this led to problems: some teams developed
    a reputation for leniency, and others for being too harsh. More insidiously, the
    setup allowed rumors to spread: a manager could be accused of giving preferential
    treatment to their buddies or love interests, with no way to disprove such claims;
    every company sooner or later developed extensive lore of this sort.'

  zh: 长期以来，企业对绩效管理的主流方法是让经理决定。毕竟，他们具有专业知识和对问题空间的熟悉度，因此人们相信他们最适合进行惩罚和奖励。但是这带来了问题：一些团队因宽容而声名狼藉，另一些则因太过严厉而闻名。更阴险的是，这种设置允许谣言传播：经理可以被指责偏袒自己的朋友或爱人，而没有办法驳斥这样的说法；每家公司迟早都会发展出这种类型的广泛传说。
- en: All this changed with Google. In its early years, the company sought to do things
    differently, and reinventing performance management seemed like fair game. The
    firm ultimately converged on a peer-based system where your performance is evaluated
    not by your boss, but by a selection of your coworkers. This promised greater
    fairness and improved transparency. Over the years, the model spread like a wildfire
    to other tech companies — and sometimes beyond.

  zh: 所有这些都随着 Google 而改变了。在早期，公司试图以不同的方式做事情，重新发明绩效管理似乎是公平的竞争。该公司最终采用了一种基于同事评估而不是老板评估的系统。这承诺更大的公平和透明度。多年来，这种模式像野火一样蔓延到其他科技公司——有时甚至超出科技范围。
- en: 'Of course, the approach imposed considerable burden across the company: once
    or twice a year, the entire business would grind to a halt with every employee
    writing self-assessments and peer feedback; after that, a significant proportion
    of senior staff would disappear to serve on committees while the underlings anxiously
    awaited results. But the benefits seemed obvious — and well worth the price.'

  zh: 当然，这种方法给整个公司带来了相当大的负担：一年一度，整个业务都会陷入停滞状态，每个员工都要写自我评估和同事反馈；之后，相当比例的高级员工会消失到委员会中，而下属们则焦急地等待结果。但好处似乎是显而易见的
    —— 而且物有所值。
- en: Except, the benefits never really materialized. The problem is that every employee
    is judged by their ability to get work done; in most roles, this depends on being
    able to get along with others, including strangers with different sensibilities
    and unfamiliar backgrounds. Providing honest, critical feedback is a significant
    and ultimately unnecessary social risk. It doesn’t help that the burden of the
    process prompts most to put the bare minimum of effort into individual reviews;
    a handful of platitudes is usually enough to get you through it and get back to
    work.

  zh: 问题在于，每个员工都是根据他们完成工作的能力来评判的；在大多数角色中，这取决于能否与他人相处融洽，包括与具有不同感知和不熟悉背景的陌生人相处。提供诚实、批判性的反馈是一个重要的，但最终是不必要的社会风险。这一过程的负担促使大多数人对个人评论投入最低限度的努力；几句陈词滥调通常足以让你度过难关，然后继续工作。
- en: In the end, the feedback for most employees ends up being overwhelmingly positive
    — and uniformly bland. The usual exceptions are the absolute worst performers
    who wouldn’t survive under any other performance management regime; as well as
    a handful of unlucky folks who deliver solid results but lack social grace and

- en: This outcome puts the organization in an unenviable position. To fix the mess,
    the managers are tasked with “interpreting” the feedback to arrive at some sort
    of a normalized ranking that can be used as a basis for firings, promotions, and
    bonuses. This happens behind the scenes in stuffy multi-hour meetings where the
    data is shuffled and massaged until it fits on some reasonable curve. The illusion
    of a peer-driven system is maintained — but in reality, for layoffs and compensation,
    the manager almost always makes the call. The actual peer feedback is of little
    consequence.

  zh: 这种结果使组织处于一个令人不快的境地。为了解决这个混乱局面，管理者被要求“解读”反馈，以得出某种可以用作裁员、晋升和奖金依据的规范化排名。这种情况发生在密室多小时的会议中，数据被不断调整和操纵，直到符合某种合理的曲线。维持了一个同事驱动的系统的幻觉
    —— 但实际上，在裁员和薪酬方面，管理者几乎总是做出决定。实际同事反馈的影响微乎其微。
- en: 'To be fair, the promotion process can involve an extra step: in many places,
    the final decision is delegated to an independent committee of senior employees.
    The panel is unlikely to promote if the manager doesn’t support the bid, but having
    your manager’s blessing doesn’t guarantee success. The goal is to maintain a consistently
    high bar, but this too comes at a hefty price. The committee must decipher voluminous
    but sloppy feedback without the benefit of knowing the nominees or understanding
    their work. Too often, the verdicts diverge from the intrinsic merit of the case.
    “You’re doing great, we just need to structure your packet differently for the
    next cycle” is a common saying when delivering the bad news.'

  zh: 公平地说，晋升过程可能会涉及一个额外的步骤：在许多地方，最终决定被委托给一个独立的由资深员工组成的委员会。如果管理者不支持提名，该委员会不太可能晋升，但得到你的管理者支持并不保证成功。目标是保持一个一贯高的标准，但这也要付出巨大的代价。委员会必须在不知道被提名人或了解他们工作的情况下解读大量但杂乱的反馈。太多时候，裁决与案例的内在价值相去甚远。在传递坏消息时，"你做得很好，我们只需要为下一个周期重新组织你的档案"是一个常见的说法。

    process isn’t necessarily any better than that of what it sought to replace. At
