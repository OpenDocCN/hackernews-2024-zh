    side of things got boring after I had gained a basic grasp of the inner logic
    of the codebase and no longer felt challenged, and then I wanted to do more, and
    more importantly - do it differently. I wondered about design decisions and their
    broader purpose: why are we doing this and why are we doing it in this specific
    way? Might there be a better way? What metrics are we using to determine success
    and why? Although these questions weren’t always posed aloud I got told I ‘think
    too much’ and ‘care too much’ when I could be using this time to churn out more
    lines of code. I didn’t belong, and I was too young and insecure to articulate
    that this wasn’t just a simple mismatch between my talent and my position. It
    was that I fundamentally disagreed with the way these places operate and wanted
    to do work to change them rather than perpetuate them.'

  zh: 我从未真正适应过我所从事的任何软件工程工作。在我基本掌握了代码库内部逻辑的基础后，技术方面的东西变得枯燥无味，并且我不再感到挑战，于是我想要更多，更重要的是——想要以不同的方式去做。我对设计决策及其更广泛的目的产生了疑问：我们为什么要这样做，为什么要以这种特定的方式去做？也许有更好的方法吗？我们用什么指标来确定成功，为什么要这样做？尽管这些问题并不总是明确提出，但当我本可以利用这些时间多写几行代码时，却被告知我“想得太多”，“关心得太多”。我不属于这里，我当时年轻且缺乏安全感，无法清楚表达这不仅仅是我的才能与职位之间简单的不匹配。我根本不同意这些地方的运作方式，我希望做的工作是改变它们而不是延续它们。
- en: If there ever was a part of me that thought ‘there has to be better things out
    there’, looking at job postings for a couple of weeks in 2023 was enough to kill
    that illusion. 90% of the time when I read descriptions it is excruciatingly obvious
    to me that whatever code the chosen candidates will end up writing at this job
    will be completely removed from any important problem not only humanity, but even
    any individual human has ever had. Startup culture is shamelessly at the forefront
    of this industry’s ‘produce more code and ask less questions’ policy. All most
    startups do is move investor’s money around while trying to acquire paid users
    by convincing them they need a product that is more often than not marginally
    useful at best. They [usually fail](https://www.quora.com/Why-do-95-of-start-ups-fail-what-do-the-5-do-right-that-make-them-successful)
    at that, leaving behind thousands of lines of unmaintainable spaghetti code engineers
    were bullied into writing in weeks instead of months using arbitrary trendy technologies.
    No one will ever look at that shit again except maybe as an example of bad coding
    practices, engineers’ time has been wasted and venture capital largely ends up
    in the hands of the people that already possess significant capital - they may
    use that to fund another startup, and this wretched cycle continues. Job ads that
    try to paint this as some kind of exciting meaningful endeavour that will enrich
    people’s lives and stimulate my engineering growth are an insult to my intelligence.
    I don’t want to be a part of this - not just because it is arguably immoral but
    because it is fundamentally and infuriatingly boring and pointless.

  zh: 如果说曾经有一部分我认为“这个世界一定有更好的事物”，那么在2023年的几周里浏览工作职位就足以摧毁这种幻想。当我读到这些职位描述时，90%的时间我都能清楚地感觉到，被选中的候选人在这份工作中编写的任何代码都将完全脱离人类甚至任何个体曾经面临过的重要问题。初创企业文化无耻地领导着这个行业的“多生产代码，少提问”的政策。大多数初创企业所做的只是在试图说服付费用户他们需要的产品实际上往往最多也只是有限用处的情况下，转移投资者的资金。它们在这方面[通常会失败](https://www.quora.com/Why-do-95-of-start-ups-fail-what-do-the-5-do-right-that-make-them-successful)，留下成千上万行无法维护的意大利面代码，工程师们在几周内被迫使用任意时髦的技术来编写这些代码，而不是几个月。除了作为糟糕编码实践的一个例子外，再也没有人会再看那些东西了，工程师们的时间被浪费了，风险资本主要流入已经拥有大量资本的人手中——他们可能会用它来资助另一个初创企业，这种可怕的循环就这样继续下去。试图把这些描述成一种令人兴奋的、有意义的努力，可以丰富人们的生活并促进我的工程成长的职位广告对我的智商是一种侮辱。我不想成为这一切的一部分——不仅因为这可能是不道德的，而且因为这基本上是令人愤怒和无聊的毫无意义之事。

    financially, they don’t really contrast them culturally. Sure, the code you write
    at a FAANG might actually make its way to users, but what you as an individual
    happen to think about any aspect of writing code will be more irrelevant than
    ever. You are a cog in a machine not only in the sense that the product you are

    the size of your backend stack, or your tech interview score, or your performance
    review score. It’s not so much this reality itself that’s so atrocious to me,
    but more the fact that as engineers we’re expected to find this empty and humiliating
    grind even more aspirational than many other workers are, and are even more discouraged
    from questioning any aspect of it.'

  zh: 尽管成熟的科技公司在组织和财务上与初创公司有所不同，但在文化上并没有真正的对比。当然，你在FAANG公司写的代码可能真的会传递给用户，但你个人对编写代码的任何方面的看法比以往任何时候都更无关紧要。你不仅仅是机器中的一个齿轮，因为你正在构建的产品很可能正在以日益阴险的方式自动化[资本主义的最坏方面](https://doctorow.medium.com/https-pluralistic-net-2023-11-06-attention-rents-consumer-welfare-queens-fa3475adb465)，而且在实际意义上，你只是一个数字：你的后端栈大小、技术面试分数或绩效评估分数。对我来说，最糟糕的并不是这个现实本身，而更多的是作为工程师，我们被期望比许多其他工人更加热衷于找到这种空虚和羞辱性的苦工，甚至更被劝阻去质疑其中的任何方面。

    as a programmer you are to focus solely on the how, rarely on the what, and certainly
    never on the why. For the rare code monkey that finds themselves able and willing
    to critique the system they’re producing for the message is clear: leave that
    shit at the door. A code monkey is prohibited from even identifying the lack of

    Even in the cases where capital and other forces outside of our immediate control
    theoretically allow for us to build software in a way that is sustainable, or
    has a positive impact on the world at large, or is at the very least useful practically
    we still often don’t, because of simple inertia: it’s easier and usually more
    viable to do what’s on trend and reproduce the status quo once more. Worse yet,
    this same inertia then seeps into the entire tech stack this societally useless
    product is built upon. The technologies all the way down to the languages, libraries,
    frameworks, and even code patterns become infected with the same brand of novelty
