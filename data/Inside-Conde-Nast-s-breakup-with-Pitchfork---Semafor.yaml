- en: As Pitchfork grew from a niche blog to the tastemaker of the indie music wave,
    and from Chicago to Brooklyn, bankers began to circle. VCs offered to inject capital.
    The swaggering Vice repeatedly suggested an acquisition that would’ve made Pitchfork
    the company’s flagship music arm. Founder Ryan Schreiber and longtime CEO Chris
    Kaskie were wary of selling to a partner who, in exchange for funding, would demand
    rapid growth. “Scale/investment always felt wrong and we said no to all of it,
    especially from the VC/PE world,” Kaskie told me in an email.

  zh: 当Pitchfork从一个小众博客成长为独立音乐浪潮的引领者，并从芝加哥扩展到布鲁克林时，银行家开始围绕。风险投资公司提出注资。自负的Vice公司多次建议收购Pitchfork，这本应使Pitchfork成为该公司的旗舰音乐部门。创始人瑞安·施赖伯和长期CEO克里斯·卡斯基对向提供资金的合作伙伴出售，并要求快速增长持怀疑态度。“规模/投资总是感觉不对，我们拒绝了所有提议，特别是来自VC/PE世界的提议，”卡斯基在电子邮件中告诉我。
- en: But Pitchfork’s margins were slim and it had little room for error. Schreiber
    and Kaskie realized that Pitchfork needed a partner. At the time, the digital
    music site had worked with Condé Nast to develop several video projects. The legacy
    magazine publisher had been pleased with the collaboration, and in Pitchfork,
    saw an opportunity. Condé was late in transitioning to the digital news era, and
    was impressed by Pitchfork’s creative editorial voice and the direct traffic to
    its homepage. Pitchfork had won a prestigious National Magazine Award in 2013
    for excellence in digital media. And Condé, which did not have a music-first title,
    was also looking to expand its events business, and was intrigued by Pitchfork’s
    festivals in Paris and Chicago. Pitchfork’s leadership felt that Condé had a long
    track record of serving as a responsible steward for the important titles, like
    The New Yorker and Vanity Fair. On October 13, 2015, the two sides announced that
    Pitchfork would join Condé.

  zh: 但Pitchfork的利润空间很窄，容错空间很小。施赖伯和卡斯基意识到Pitchfork需要一个合作伙伴。当时，这家数字音乐网站曾与康泰纳仕合作开发了几个视频项目。这家传统的杂志出版商对合作感到满意，看到了Pitchfork的机会。康泰纳仕在数字新闻时代转型较晚，对Pitchfork的创意编辑声音和直接访问其主页的流量印象深刻。Pitchfork因其在数字媒体方面的卓越表现，曾在2013年赢得过一项著名的国家杂志奖。康泰纳仕并没有一个以音乐为主题的刊物，也希望扩展其活动业务，并对Pitchfork在巴黎和芝加哥举办的音乐节感到感兴趣。Pitchfork的领导层认为康泰纳仕在管理重要出版物（如《纽约客》和《名利场》）方面有着悠久的历史记录。2015年10月13日，双方宣布Pitchfork将加入康泰纳仕。

    departures, and most of all the dramatic shifts in digital media began to slowly
    chip away at Pitchfork.

  zh: 但多年来，成本削减、几乎持续不断的公司重组和员工离职，以及数字媒体的剧烈变化，开始逐渐侵蚀Pitchfork。
- en: The site — born in the texty ‘90s web — went through a familiar set of digital
    media spasms. In 2012, YouTube had given Pitchfork money to create original content
    for Pitchfork TV, which had impressed Condé Nast. But within a few years, Conde
    moved Pitchfork’s video team under Condé Nast Entertainment, its commercial special
    projects arm. CNE, which continues to struggle to turn video into a profitable
    business, was not interested in continuing many of the video projects and channels
    Pitchfork had nearly a dozen full time staffers working on pre-acquisition. Video
    staff eventually left or were laid off. Pitchfork also saw some of its identity
    folded into corporate efficiencies. Its in-house design and creative teams, which
    had helped win the publication awards for editorial, were similarly absorbed or
    laid off.

  zh: 这个网站——在90年代的文字网站中诞生——经历了一系列熟悉的数字媒体震荡。2012年，YouTube向Pitchfork提供资金，为Pitchfork
    TV创作原创内容，这给康泰纳仕留下了深刻印象。但在几年后，康泰纳仕将Pitchfork的视频团队划归到其商业特别项目部门康泰纳仕娱乐（CNE）下。CNE一直在努力将视频转化为盈利业务，对继续进行Pitchfork几乎有十名全职员工投入的许多视频项目和频道不感兴趣。视频团队最终离开或被裁员。Pitchfork的一些特性也被合并到公司的效率中。它的内部设计和创意团队，曾帮助该出版物赢得编辑奖项，也同样被吸收或被裁员。
- en: 'Condé also tried to fit the community-based site into the audience-driven terms
    of programmatic advertising sales. Condé chief digital officer Fred Santarpia
    had irritated Pitchfork staff when he told the New York Times in 2015 that Pitchfork
    would help Condé with male audiences, an idea that some inside Condé could not
    shake. In 2016, Condé Nast sorted the news brands under three different umbrellas:
    Fashion, Men’s, and Culture. Pitchfork still was furious that the publication
    was initially placed into the “Men’s” bucket.'

  zh: 康泰还试图将这个基于社区的网站适应程序化广告销售的观众驱动术语。康泰首席数字官Fred Santarpia在2015年告诉《纽约时报》Pitchfork将帮助康泰赢得男性观众时，这一想法激怒了Pitchfork工作人员，一些康泰内部人士无法摆脱这个想法。2016年，康泰公司将新闻品牌归类为时尚、男性和文化三个不同的类别。Pitchfork仍然对最初被归入“男性”类别感到愤怒。
- en: After Santarpia, who led the acquisition, left in 2018, there were fewer voices
    at the executive level to advocate for Pitchfork. Where Pitchfork’s leadership
    once reported to Santarpia, the publication was put under the purview of Anna
    Wintour, who several current and former staff did not seem to express particular
    interest in the site. In 2017, two years into a five year contract, Kaskie quit
    over frustrations with Condé about the diminishment of his role within Pitchfork,
    and the publication’s autonomy within the parent company. Schreiber never found
    a clear role within Condé Nast’s business side, and left years before the end
    of his contract. As digital media began to sputter in 2018, a new editor, Puja
    Patel, attempted to diversify Pitchfork’s staff and broaden the perspectives without
    compromising its editorial voice. But she also faced pressure to cut costs as
    traffic from social media platforms declined and Spotify’s algorithms siphoned
    off more casual fans who’d used Pitchfork for music discovery.

  zh: 在领导收购的Santarpia于2018年离开后，执行层面对Pitchfork的支持声音减少了。Pitchfork的领导曾向Santarpia汇报，但现在该出版物由Anna
    Wintour负责监督，一些现任和前任员工似乎对该网站并不表现出特别的兴趣。在一份为期五年的合同已执行两年后，Kaskie因对康泰公司对其在Pitchfork内角色削弱的不满而辞职。Schreiber在康泰公司的商业部门从未找到明确的角色，并在合同结束前几年离开。随着2018年数字媒体的蹒跚起步，新编辑Puja
    Patel试图在不损害其编辑声音的情况下，使Pitchfork的员工多样化并拓宽视角。但她也面临着来自社交媒体平台流量下降和Spotify算法转移更多偶然发现音乐的粉丝的压力，因此需要削减成本。

    still didn’t quite *get* Pitchfork, at least in the eyes of staff.

  zh: 在其他领域，有时公司的某些部门似乎对Pitchfork仍然不太*理解*，至少在员工看来是这样的。
- en: Condé has fulfilled some of the initial vision for Pitchfork’s consumer events
    business. Over the last several years, the publication has expanded into three
    new cities (London, Berlin, and Mexico City), and thrown other ticketed parties.
    The company has increased revenue from sponsorships of the festival, which has
    offset some softer ticket scans for several years at the festivals. But there
    has also been creative friction between Pitchfork and the parent company over
    the events. Pitchfork staff butted heads with Condé over attempts to further monetize
    the festival in a way that some felt eroded the brand. Condéhad pushed to make
    the festival experience more “luxury.” In 2016, a group of Condé sales people
    attended the festival in Chicago. Some complained afterwards that it was “not
    chic enough.” Condé pushed to build out Pitchfork’s VIP ticket experience for
    the festivals, an easy new potential source of revenue, prompting grumbling within
    Pitchfork about whether that would interfere with the actual VIP areas the publication
    already had for artists. In a recent meeting, one Condé senior vice president
    in charge of events made the outlandish suggestion that Pitchfork could juice
    ticket sales by reuniting Oasis or the White Stripes.

  zh: 康泰公司已经实现了Pitchfork消费者活动业务的部分初衷。在过去几年里，该出版物扩展到了三个新城市（伦敦、柏林和墨西哥城），并举办了其他付费派对。公司通过赞助音乐节增加了收入，这在几年内抵消了音乐节软票务扫描的一些下降。但是，Pitchfork与母公司之间在活动方面也存在创意摩擦。Pitchfork工作人员因为Condé试图进一步商业化音乐节的尝试而与其发生冲突，一些人认为这种做法侵蚀了品牌形象。康泰公司推动使音乐节体验更加“豪华”。2016年，一群康泰销售人员参加了芝加哥的音乐节。其中一些人事后抱怨称这并不“时尚”。康泰公司推动扩展Pitchfork音乐节的VIP票务体验，这是一个潜在的新收入来源，这引发了Pitchfork内部人士对此是否会影响已为艺术家准备的实际VIP区域的不满。在最近的一次会议上，一位负责活动的康泰高级副总裁荒谬地建议，Pitchfork可以通过重新组合Oasis或白条纹来刺激票务销售。
