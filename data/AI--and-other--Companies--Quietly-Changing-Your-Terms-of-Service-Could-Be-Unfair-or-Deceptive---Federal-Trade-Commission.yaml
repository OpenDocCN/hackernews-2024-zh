    raw material that drives innovation in tech and business, and like oil, it must
    be collected at a massive scale and then refined in order to be useful. And there
    is perhaps no data refinery as large-capacity and as data-hungry as AI. Companies
    developing AI products, as we have [noted](/node/82317), possess a continuous
    appetite for more and newer data, and they may find that the readiest source of
    crude data are their own userbases. But many of these companies also have privacy
    and data security policies in place to protect users’ information. These companies
    now face a potential conflict of interest: they have powerful business incentives
    to turn the abundant flow of user data into more fuel for their AI products, but
    they also have existing commitments to protect their users’ privacy.'

  zh: 或许你已经听说过“数据是新的石油”的说法——换句话说，数据是推动科技和商业创新的关键原材料，就像石油一样，必须大规模收集，然后精炼才能发挥其用途。也许没有比人工智能更需要大量数据和更大容量的数据精炼厂了。正如我们在[此处指出](/node/82317)，开发AI产品的公司对获取更多和更新的数据有持续的需求，它们可能会发现，最可靠的原始数据来源就是它们自己的用户群体。但许多这类公司也制定了隐私和数据安全政策来保护用户的信息。这些公司现在面临潜在的利益冲突：它们有强大的商业激励将用户数据丰富的流量转化为其AI产品的燃料，但同时也有现有承诺保护用户隐私的义务。
- en: Companies might be tempted to resolve this conflict by simply changing the terms
    of their privacy policy so that they are no longer restricted in the ways they
    can use their customers’ data. And to avoid backlash from users who are concerned
    about their privacy, companies may try to make these changes surreptitiously.
    But market participants should be on notice that any firm that reneges on its
    user privacy commitments risks running afoul of the law.

    deceptive and unfair practices in connection to a company’s privacy policy that
    affect the promises the company made to consumers. Nearly two decades ago, the
    FTC charged [Gateway Learning Corporation](/news-events/news/press-releases/2004/07/gateway-learning-settles-ftc-privacy-charges),
    known for its “Hooked on Phonics” products, with violating the FTC Act after it
    changed its privacy policy to allow it to share consumer data with third parties

    Learning Corporation](/news-events/news/press-releases/2004/07/gateway-learning-settles-ftc-privacy-charges)，在未通知消费者或获得其同意的情况下更改其隐私政策，允许其与第三方分享消费者数据，从而违反了联邦贸易委员会法案。

    violated the law when the company changed its privacy policy to retroactively
    expand the kinds of third parties with which it could share consumers’ personal
    data. The company did that without notifying consumers who had previously shared
    personal data or obtaining their consent, said the FTC.

- en: 'Even though the technological landscape has changed between 2004 and today,
    particularly with the advent of consumer-facing AI products, the facts remain
    the same: A business that collects user data based on one set of privacy commitments
    cannot then unilaterally renege on those commitments after collecting users’ data.
    Especially given that certain features of digital markets can make it more difficult
    for users to easily switch between services, users may lack recourse once a firm
    has used attractive privacy commitments to lure them to the product only to turn
    around and then back out of those commitments.'

  zh: 尽管技术景观在2004年到今天已发生了变化，特别是随着面向消费者的人工智能产品的出现，事实仍然如故：一家企业在基于一组隐私承诺收集用户数据后，不能单方面背弃这些承诺。特别是在数字市场的某些特征可能使用户难以轻松切换服务的情况下，一旦公司利用吸引人的隐私承诺将他们吸引到产品中，却又背弃了这些承诺，用户可能缺乏救济措施。

    on consumers by surreptitiously re-writing their privacy policies or terms of
    service to allow themselves free rein to use consumer data for product development.
    Ultimately, there’s nothing intelligent about obtaining artificial consent.
