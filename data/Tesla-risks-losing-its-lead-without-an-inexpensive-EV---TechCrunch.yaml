  zh: 伊隆·马斯克决定选择机器出租车而不是一款廉价电动车，这可能会让公司失去领先地位。
- en: Last week, Musk reportedly [canned the effort](https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/05/tesla-abandons-low-cost-ev-robotaxi/)
    in favor of a robotaxi, the sort of pie-in-the-sky project that defined his first
    decade at the helm. There’s an argument to be made that the company is where it
    is today by betting big, then delivering on enough of its promises to impress
    shareholders and generate significant positive cashflow. Problem is, in the early
    days, there was both everything and nothing to lose. The whole company could have
    gone under, but there was also less on the line.

  zh: 上周，马斯克据报道[取消了这一努力](https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/05/tesla-abandons-low-cost-ev-robotaxi/)，而选择了机器出租车，这种项目可以说是定义了他掌舵头十年的一种奇思妙想。有人认为，公司今天的成就归功于大胆的赌注，然后在足够多的承诺上交出满意的答卷，以打动股东并产生显著的正现金流。问题在于，在早期，既有一切，也没什么可输的。整个公司本可以破产，但风险也较低。
- en: Today, Tesla is no longer the plucky upstart. It brought in nearly $100 billion
    in revenue last year and earned net profits of $15 billion, the sort that would
    have other automakers rewarding shareholders with richer dividends. It’s a global
    manufacturer that cranks out hundreds of thousands of cars every quarter, the
    type of operation where success is measured in continuous improvement in productivity
    and process indicators.

  zh: 如今，特斯拉不再是那个勇敢的新秀。去年，它实现了将近1,000亿美元的营收，并赚取了150亿美元的净利润，这种利润水平足以让其他汽车制造商向股东发放更丰厚的股息。它是一个全球制造商，每个季度生产数十万辆汽车，这种运营方式的成功在于持续改善生产率和流程指标。
- en: Tesla was reportedly on the cusp of building a $25,000 EV. In January, Musk
    confirmed that the company would begin construction of a next-generation vehicle
    at its Texas plant in the second half of 2025\. Suppliers had been asked to bid
    on parts contracts, Reuters [reported](https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/tesla-plans-build-new-electric-vehicles-mid-2025-sources-2024-01-24/),
    with weekly production volume starting at 10,000 vehicles per week. Given [flagging
    sales](https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/02/tesla-sales-drop-first-quarter-estimates-deliveries/)
    of the company’s existing product line, it would have been a welcome shot in the
    arm.

  zh: 据报道，特斯拉曾计划建造一款价格为25,000美元的电动车。今年1月，马斯克确认公司将在2025年下半年在其得克萨斯工厂开始建造下一代车型。据路透社[报道](https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/tesla-plans-build-new-electric-vehicles-mid-2025-sources-2024-01-24/)，供应商已被要求竞标零部件合同，每周生产量从10,000辆车开始。鉴于[公司现有产品线的销量下滑](https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/02/tesla-sales-drop-first-quarter-estimates-deliveries/)，这将是一种受益匪浅的激励措施。
- en: An inexpensive EV would have significantly increased Tesla’s total addressable
    market by dramatically undercutting the average sales price in the U.S., which
    is currently at around $47,000\. It also would have given the company a product
    to hold its ground against a predicted onslaught of inexpensive Chinese EVs.

  zh: 一款廉价的电动车本可以大幅扩展特斯拉的总可寻址市场，大幅低于当前美国的平均销售价格，约为47,000美元。它还将使公司能够抗衡预期的廉价中国电动车的大规模入侵。

- en: Musk has long been enamored with the concept. Four years ago, he said that such
    a car would be able to earn its owner up to $30,000 per year as it ferried paying
    passengers to and fro. It would be so popular, Musk [reportedly](https://www.axios.com/2023/09/08/tesla-musk-global-electric-car-robotaxis)
    told biographer Walter Isaacson, that “there is no amount that we could possibly
    build that will be enough.”

  zh: 长久以来，马斯克一直着迷于这个概念。四年前，他表示这样一辆车每年能为车主赚取高达30,000美元，因为它会载客往返。马斯克[据说告诉传记作家沃尔特·艾萨克森](https://www.axios.com/2023/09/08/tesla-musk-global-electric-car-robotaxis)，这款车将如此受欢迎，以至于“我们无论生产多少都不会够。”
- en: Problem is, Tesla has been trying to master autonomous hardware and software
    for a while now, and it doesn’t appear anywhere close to delivering a vehicle
    capable of Level 5 driving, which would require zero human input. Despite years
    of work, Autopilot remains a Level 2 system, which means it requires human attention
    at all times. The same is true for Full Self-Driving. (Indeed, the company recently
    started using the term “supervised” when referring to the software suite.) And
    while artificial intelligence has been advancing rapidly of late, is it moving
    quickly enough to provide Tesla with a blockbuster product in the next few years?

  zh: 问题在于，特斯拉一直在努力掌握自动驾驶硬件和软件，但似乎离推出能够实现完全自动驾驶（Level 5）的车辆还有很大差距，这需要零人工干预。尽管经过多年的努力，Autopilot仍然是一个Level
    2系统，这意味着它始终需要人类的注意力。全自动驾驶也是如此。（事实上，最近公司开始在提及该软件套件时使用“监督”这个术语。）尽管人工智能近来取得了快速进展，但它是否能够足够快地为特斯拉提供未来几年的重磅产品？
- en: Given Musk’s desire to pursue exploratory projects, the logical path would be
    to spin up a skunkworks inside Tesla or spin out a division that’s purely focused
    on bringing a robotaxi to market. The latter is unlikely to happen because much
    of Musk’s wealth is tied up in Tesla stock, and he probably doesn’t trust anyone
    else to run the company when that much money is on the line. The former has more
    of a chance, but Musk also likes to appear heavily involved in, well, everything
    at Tesla. He’d balk at the idea of “only” running a skunkworks.

  zh: 马斯克希望进行探索性项目，逻辑上讲，最合理的路径是在特斯拉内部启动一个秘密研发项目组，或者独立成立一个专注于推出自动驾驶出租车的部门。但后者不太可能发生，因为马斯克的大部分财富都投资在特斯拉股票上，当这么多资金处于风险中时，他可能不会信任其他人来管理公司。前者有更大的机会，但马斯克也喜欢在特斯拉的所有事务中显得非常积极参与。他可能会对“仅仅”负责一个秘密研发项目组的想法感到不满。
- en: It’s something that Tesla’s board should probably be weighing in on. And maybe
    they are. But numerous [reports](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/15/business/teslas-board-elon-musk-robyn-denholm.html)
    have also illustrated just how tightly linked that board is with Musk. They don’t
    appear to disagree on much, and that could cost Tesla its lead.
