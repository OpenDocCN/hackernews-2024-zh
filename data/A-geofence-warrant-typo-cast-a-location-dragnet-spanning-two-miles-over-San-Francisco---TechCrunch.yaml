- en: Civil liberties advocates have long argued that “geofence” search warrants are
    unconstitutional for their ability to ensnare entirely innocent people who were
    nearby at the time a crime was committed. But errors in the geofence warrant applications
    that go before a judge can violate the privacy of vastly more people — in one
    case almost two miles away.

  zh: 长期以来，民权倡导者一直主张“地理围栏”搜索令违反宪法，因为它们有能力困住在犯罪发生时附近的完全无辜的人。但在提交给法官的地理围栏搜查令申请中出现的错误可能侵犯更多人的隐私
    —— 在某个案例中，距离错误标记在搜索令上的旧金山近两英里的地方。
- en: Attorneys at the ACLU of Northern California found what they called an “alarming
    error” in a geofence warrant application that “resulted in a warrant stretching
    nearly two miles across San Francisco.” The error, likely caused by a typo, allowed
    the requesting law enforcement agency to capture information on anyone who entered
    the stretch of San Francisco erroneously marked on the search warrant.

  zh: 加利福尼亚北部美国公民自由联盟的律师在一份地理围栏搜查令申请中发现了他们称之为“令人震惊的错误”，这一错误“导致搜查令在旧金山延伸近两英里”。这个错误可能是由于打字错误引起的，它允许请求的执法机构获取任何进入错误标记的旧金山区域的信息。

- en: The ACLU attorneys reviewed thousands of geofence warrants filed in San Francisco
    Criminal Court that were issued over three years between 2018 and mid-2021, which
    they say was likely only a fraction of geofence warrants used in San Francisco
    during that time. The attorneys warned that the reach of geofence warrants when
    surveilling in busy urban areas — San Francisco is one of the most densely populated
    U.S. cities — often include homes and apartment buildings, busy thoroughfares
    and places of worship.

  zh: ACLU的律师们审查了三年内2018年到2021年中期在旧金山刑事法院提交的数千份地理围栏搜查令，他们表示这可能只是在此期间旧金山使用的地理围栏搜查令的一小部分。律师们警告说，在监视繁忙城市地区时，地理围栏搜查令的覆盖范围
    —— 旧金山是美国人口密度最高的城市之一 —— 经常包括私人住宅和公寓楼、繁忙的大道以及宗教场所。
- en: The attorneys said they also found a geofence warrant that included four places
    of worship over a couple of streets in San Francisco’s Bret Harte neighborhood,
    allowing police to determine “where you were and who you were with” during the
    time that the warrant was in effect.
