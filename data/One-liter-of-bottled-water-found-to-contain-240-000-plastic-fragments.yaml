- en: Using advanced imaging technology, researchers have ascertained the number of
    nanoplastics – bits of plastic smaller than a micrometer – in bottled water, finding
    that, on average, a liter contains 240,000 detectable fragments. The study provides
    invaluable information to address rising concerns about micro- and nanoplastic
    toxicity.

  zh: 利用先进的成像技术，研究人员确定了瓶装水中纳米塑料的数量——小于一微米的塑料碎片——发现，平均一升水含有 240,000 个可检测的碎片。该研究为解决关于微塑料和纳米塑料毒性不断上升的担忧提供了宝贵信息。
- en: Microplastics – ranging from less than a quarter inch (5 mm) down to a micrometer
    – are formed when plastics break down into progressively smaller bits. And, in
    recent years, concerns have been raised that microplastics are showing up literally
    everywhere on Earth – from the [bottom of oceans](https://newatlas.com/environment/record-microplastics-seafloor/)
    to the [top of mountains](https://newatlas.com/environment/highest-microplastics-top-mt-everest/).

  zh: 微塑料——从不到四分之一英寸（5 毫米）到一微米——是当塑料逐渐分解成越来越小的颗粒时形成的。近年来，人们开始担心微塑料实际上无处不在——从海洋底部到山顶。
- en: These plastic particles are consumed by humans and other creatures, with research
    now looking into the potentially harmful effects of this consumption. However,
    these studies are predominantly concerned with microplastics. Now, researchers
    from the Columbia Climate School, New York, have used advances in imaging technology
    to investigate the ‘spawn’ of microplastics – nanoplastics, less than a micrometer
    in size – to see how prevalent they are in the bottled water we drink.

  zh: 这些塑料颗粒被人类和其他生物食用，现在的研究正在探讨这种摄入可能带来的潜在有害影响。然而，这些研究主要关注微塑料。现在，来自纽约哥伦比亚气候学院的研究人员利用成像技术的进步来调查微塑料的“后代”——纳米塑料，其尺寸小于一微米——看看它们在我们饮用的瓶装水中有多普遍。

    the study’s corresponding authors. “This [study] opens a window where we can look

- en: The researchers developed a technique called stimulated Raman scattering (SRS)
    microscopy, which involves probing samples with two simultaneous lasers that are
    tuned to make specific molecules resonate. The technique allows micro- and nanoplastic
    analysis at the single-particle level, providing high chemical specificity and
    throughput. Focusing on seven common plastics, the researchers created a data-driven
    algorithm to interpret the results.

- en: Testing three popular brands of bottled water sold in the US (they declined
    to name them), the researchers analyzed them for the plastic particles present
    down to just 100 nanometers in size, which had previously been invisible under
    conventional imaging. They observed 110,000 to 370,000 plastic fragments in each
    liter (33.8 fl oz), 90% of which were nanoplastics. The rest were the larger –
    but still very small – microplastics. They determined which of the seven specific
    plastics they were and charted their shapes, information which could be relevant
    to biomedical research.

    盎司）中有 11 万至 37 万个塑料碎片，其中 90% 是纳米塑料。其余的是较大的——但仍然非常小的——微塑料。他们确定了它们是七种特定塑料中的哪一种，并绘制了它们的形状，这些信息可能与生物医学研究相关。
- en: Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) was common, which is not unusual as it’s what
    many water bottles are made of. PET probably enters the water when the bottle
    is squeezed, exposed to heat, or when the cap is screwed off and on. However,
    compared to PET, the researchers found higher amounts of polyamide, a type of
    nylon that, ironically, probably comes from plastic filters used to purify the
    water before it’s bottled. The other commonly seen plastics included polystyrene,
    polyvinyl chloride and polymethyl methacrylate, all of which are used in various
    industrial processes.

  zh: 聚对苯二甲酸乙二酯（PET）很常见，这并不奇怪，因为许多水瓶都是由它制成的。当瓶子被挤压、暴露于热量中，或者瓶盖被旋开和旋紧时，PET可能会进入水中。然而，与PET相比，研究人员发现了更高量的聚酰胺，这是一种尼龙，具有讽刺意味的是，这可能来自于用于净化水的塑料过滤器。其他常见的塑料包括聚苯乙烯、聚氯乙烯和聚甲基丙烯酸甲酯，这些都是用于各种工业过程中的材料。
- en: “Our results confirm the plastic fragmentation beyond the micron level by unambiguously
    detecting nanoplastics in real-life samples,” said the researchers. “Similar to
    many other particle size distributions in the natural world, there are substantially
    more nanoplastics, despite being invisible or unidentified under conventional
    particle imaging techniques, than previously counted large micron ones.”

- en: Somewhat concerningly, the seven plastics tested accounted for only about 10%
    of all the nanoplastics the researchers found in the bottled water. They had no
    idea what the others were and whether they are, in fact, nanoplastics. Assuming
    that they are nanoplastics, the researchers say, means they could number in the
    tens of millions per liter.

    noted growing evidence of ingested microplastics accumulating in mammalian tissues
    and organs and negatively affecting endocrine function, reproduction, gut microbiota,
    and immune responses in rats and mice. The authors of that study concluded that
    it was essential for further studies to be conducted to determine the potential
    hazards posed by micro- and nanoplastics.

- en: The researchers here say that the association between particle shape and chemical
    composition has “profound implications” for toxicological concerns. Studies have
    started to indicate that toxicity induced by micro- and nanoplastics is not only
    dose-dependent, but it is related to the particles’ physical and chemical characteristics
    and their effect on cellular interactions and uptake. They say that single-particle
    imaging data such as that gathered by their research provides indispensable information
    to address the rising concerns relating to toxicity.
