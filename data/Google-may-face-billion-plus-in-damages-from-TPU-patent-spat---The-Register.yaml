    lawsuit in a Massachusetts federal court against the cloud titan [[PDF](https://regmedia.co.uk/2024/01/09/singular_google_complaint.pdf)].
    According to the complaint, Bates disclosed various technologies he had come up
    with to Google under a non-disclosure agreement on three occasions between 2010
    and 2014\. During this time, Singular said, Bates made Google aware the technologies
    in question were patent protected.

- en: The patents, said to have been first filed in 2009 and made public in 2010,
    describe a computer architecture designed to execute a large number of low-precision
    calculations each processor cycle. While this lower precision may be impractical
    for conventional compute workloads, the complaint argues it's well suited to AI
    software that can accommodate this lower precision.

    on paper, as a prototype based on the designs was constructed shortly after the

    designs could be "really well suited" for the web goliath's workloads, according
