    allows customers to skip checkout altogether by scanning a QR code when they enter
    the store. Though it seemed completely automated, Just Walk Out relied on more
    than [1,000 people in India watching and labeling videos](https://www.theinformation.com/articles/how-amazons-big-bet-on-just-walk-out-stumbled?rc=5xvgzc)
    to ensure accurate checkouts. The cashiers were simply moved off-site, and they

    presenting Amazon’s biggest and boldest innovation in grocery shopping. The technology
    seemed incredible, but there were some stumbles. It often took hours for customers
    to receive receipts after leaving the store, largely because offshore cashiers
    were rewatching videos and assigning items to different customers. The system
    of scanners and video cameras in each store is also incredibly expensive.
