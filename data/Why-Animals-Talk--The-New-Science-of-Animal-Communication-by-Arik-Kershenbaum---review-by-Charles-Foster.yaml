    language (by which we mean our kind of language) as evidence of moral significance.
    But do animals talk? Many traditions assume they do, and understanding animal
    talk has sometimes been thought to indicate great human wisdom. The proverbially
    wise Solomon understood the language of the birds, and St Francis preached to
    them. Most of us have asked what a crow’s squawk or a dog’s whine means.Perhaps
    we ask because we feel that animals can tell us something we don’t know about
    the sort of place this world is.

  zh: 如果一头牛说，“不要吃我”，我们就不会吃。我们似乎将语言能力（我们指的是我们的语言类型）视为道德意义的证据。但动物会说话吗？许多传统认为它们会，理解动物的语言有时被认为是表现出伟大的人类智慧的指标。寓言中聪明的所罗门理解鸟类的语言，圣弗朗西斯向它们传教。我们大多数人都问过乌鸦的叫声或狗的哀鸣意味着什么。也许我们之所以问，是因为我们感觉动物能告诉我们一些关于这个世界是什么样子的东西。
- en: For much of the last four hundred years, enquiries of this kind have been disreputable.
    Descartes declared that animals were automatons and Enlightenment thinkers duly
    reconceived the cosmos and everything in it, apart from humans, as a machine.
    We humans hung on to our souls for a while, but now we are machines too. The study
    of animal behaviour has long been merely the study of how animals reactto stimuli.
    Ask what they were *thinking* and the journals would reject your article.

  zh: 在过去的四百年中，这类探索往往是不光彩的。笛卡尔宣称动物是自动机器，启蒙思想家们因此重新构想了宇宙及其中的一切，除了人类，一切都是机器。我们人类曾一度坚持我们的灵魂，但现在我们也是机器。动物行为的研究长期以来仅仅是研究动物对刺激的反应。如果问起它们在*思考*什么，期刊会拒绝你的文章。
- en: But things are changing, as Arik Kershenbaum’s splendid book shows. A University
    of Cambridge zoologist specialising in the science of animal communication, he
    has studied five – wolves, dolphins, parrots, hyraxes and chimpanzees – of the
    seven species considered in this book in the wild (the other two are gibbons and
    humans). It might seem obvious that animal communication should be studied in
    the wild, but this idea is quite recent and radical. It requires a rejection of
    Descartes’s canonical premise. If a rat is an automaton, it can be studied satisfactorily
    in a laboratory maze.

  zh: 但事情正在发生变化，正如阿里克·科尔申鲍姆出色的书籍所展示的那样。作为剑桥大学的动物学家，专注于动物沟通科学，他在野外研究了本书中考虑的七种动物中的五种——狼、海豚、鹦鹉、岩狐和黑猩猩（另外两种是长臂猿和人类）。动物沟通应该在野外研究似乎是显而易见的，但这个想法是相当新颖和激进的。这需要拒绝笛卡尔的经典前提。如果一只老鼠是一个自动机器，那么可以在实验室的迷宫中进行令人满意的研究。
- en: 'Kershenbaum begins with another observation that sounds trite: to understand
    animal communication we have to understand the animal societies in which the communication
    occurs. We have to ask *why* animals whistle, grunt and howl. Such activities
    are costly. Natural selection demands a strenuous justification for the outlay.
    On this issue, there are few great surprises in his survey. Wolves howl to mark
    their territory and to keep in touch over long distances; high-ranking male hyraxes
    have complex songs because complexity is a good marker of fitness and is attractive
    to females; gibbon couples sing duets to one another when they wake to keep the
    relationship strong and to declare to listening would-be adulterers that there
    is no chance of an extramarital affair; chimpanzees use many sounds from their
    wide repertoire for political intrigue, for threatening, for coaxing and cajoling,
    and for coordinating monkey hunts; many animal utterances are undifferentiated
    bursts of emotion, rather like human exclamations such as ‘Oh my god’ or ‘What
    on earth?’'

  zh: Kershenbaum从另一个听起来陈词滥调的观察开始：要理解动物的沟通，我们必须理解沟通发生的动物社会。我们必须问动物为什么吹口哨、咕噜和嚎叫。这些活动是昂贵的。自然选择要求对这些支出有充分的理由。在这个问题上，他的调查中没有太多的大惊小怪。狼们嚎叫来标记他们的领地并保持与远处联系；高级别的雄性岩狸兔有复杂的歌声，因为复杂是健康的良好标志，对雌性很有吸引力；长臂猿夫妇在醒来时互唱二重奏以保持关系稳固，并向聆听的可能外遇者宣布没有外遇的可能性；黑猩猩使用他们广泛的声音库进行政治阴谋、威胁、哄骗和协调猴子狩猎；许多动物的话语是情感的不分化爆发，有点像人类的感叹词，如‘哦，我的上帝’或‘究竟是什么？’
- en: But is any of this really language? Kershenbaum shrewdly sidesteps the question.
    There is nothing obviously akin to wordsin animal discourse, he says, and though
    syntax – the ordering of sounds – is ubiquitous in animal vocalisations, he dismisses
    the notion of full-blown animal grammar.

  zh: 但这真的是语言吗？Kershenbaum巧妙地绕过了这个问题。他说在动物的话语中并没有明显类似于单词的东西，虽然语法——声音的排序——在动物的声音中是普遍存在的，但他对完整的动物语法的概念不屑一顾。
- en: What about personal identifiers? These may presume a person. There are indeed
    intriguing indications among animals not just of individuation but also of personhood
    (does any dog owner deny it?). Dolphins have individual ‘signature’ whistles which
    say to anyone listening, ‘This is me.’ They respond excitedly when they hear a
    recording of the signature whistle of a dolphin they have not seen for years.
    Mothers use their own whistle to call for lost calves. They’re not quite calling
    out their names, but they’re not far off it.

  zh: 个人识别符号呢？这可能推测一个人。在动物之间确实有令人感兴趣的迹象，不仅仅是个体化，还有人格化（任何狗主人会否认吗？）。海豚有独特的个体‘签名’口哨声，告诉任何听到的人‘这是我’。他们在听到多年未见的海豚的签名口哨声录音时会兴奋地作出反应。母海豚使用自己的口哨声呼唤迷失的幼崽。他们并没有完全在呼唤他们的名字，但也差不多。
- en: 'It is clear that some animals have the potential to use language in the sense
    that we understand it. This is not realised in the wild because it would not give
    a selective advantage. African grey parrots are the obvious example. One famous
    African grey, Alex, lived in Professor Irene Pepperberg’s lab. Every night, when
    she left for home, he said to her, ‘You be good. I love you. See you tomorrow.’
    That’s not particularly impressive: the parrot could simply have been copying
    her. But Alex could do much more than that. He knew that words related to concepts,
    which is probably a defining element of any true language. If presented with a
    tray of objects of different shapes and colours and made of various materials,
    he would accurately answer questions such as ‘How many triangles?’ or ‘How many
    red squares?’ or ‘How many wood?’ And he learned not just the associations of
    words, but their meanings too. He looked into a mirror and asked, ‘What colour?’
    That was how he learned the word ‘grey’. This has been described as the only known
    example of a non-human asking a direct question. Alex, says Kershenbaum, had ‘the
    core of what is necessary for language’ – and probably ‘that’s an understatement’.'

  zh: 很明显，有些动物在我们理解的语言意义上具有使用语言的潜力。这在野外并没有实现，因为这不会带来选择性优势。非洲灰鹦鹉就是一个明显的例子。一个著名的非洲灰鹦鹉
    Alex 住在伊琳·佩佩伯格教授的实验室里。每天晚上，当她回家时，他对她说，“你要乖，我爱你，明天见。”这并不特别令人印象深刻：这只鹦鹉可能只是在模仿她。但
    Alex 能做得更多。他知道单词与概念相关联，这可能是任何真正语言的定义要素。如果给他一个装满不同形状、颜色和材质的物体的托盘，他能准确地回答像“有多少个三角形？”、“有多少个红色的正方形？”或“有多少个木头？”这样的问题。他不仅学会了单词的关联，还学会了它们的含义。他看着镜子问，“是什么颜色？”这就是他学会“灰色”这个词的方式。这被描述为已知的非人类直接提问的唯一例子。Kershenbaum
    表示，Alex 具有“语言所需的核心” —— 或许“这是一个保守的说法”。
- en: ‘Do animals have language?’ is a bad question. They talk, concludes Kershenbaum,
    but not in the way we do. We are pathologically linguistic. We chop the world
    up into propositions and, if we’re not careful, examine those rather than the
    world itself. The behaviourist Temple Grandin speculates that non-human animals
    might rely on mental images rather than something tantamount to language to conceptualise
    ideas (as people like her, with autism spectrum disorder, do). We can’t know,
    but Kershenbaum is sympathetic to the notion.

  zh: “动物是否有语言？”是一个不好的问题。Kershenbaum 得出结论说，它们会说话，但方式不同于我们。我们是病态的语言主义者。我们将世界分割成命题，如果不小心，我们会检验那些命题，而不是世界本身。行为学家
    Temple Grandin 推测，非人类动物可能依赖于心理图像而不是类似语言的东西来概念化思想（就像像她这样的自闭症谱系障碍患者）。我们无法确定，但是 Kershenbaum
    对这种观念表示同情。
- en: 'Kershenbaum no doubt sees *Why Animals Talk* as a book about biology. I prefer
    to see it as a humble, genial, scholarly, impeccably clear meditation on our own
    *Umwelt*.He challenges us to consider that there are ways of being in the world
    other than ours. Our old instinct is right: if we learn how to listen properly,
    animals really can tell us something significant about the world that we wouldn’t
    know without them.'

    *Umwelt* 的沉思。他挑战我们考虑到，世界上除了我们的方式外，还有其他存在方式。我们的本能告诉我们：如果我们学会了正确倾听，动物确实能够告诉我们一些关于世界的重要信息，这是我们没有它们就不会知道的。
