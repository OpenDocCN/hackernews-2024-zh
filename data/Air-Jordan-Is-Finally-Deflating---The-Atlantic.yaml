- en: 'Few people have derived more profit from a colleague’s superstition than Tim
    Hallam, a former communications director for the Chicago Bulls. In the spring
    of 1991, the Bulls were preparing for their first NBA Finals, against Magic Johnson’s
    aging Lakers, when Hallam approached Michael Jordan, the team’s superstar, to
    ask him for a kindness. If, as expected, the Bulls won, would Jordan give him
    a shoe from the clinching game? Jordan agreed, the Bulls won, and, in the confetti
    frenzy of tears and champagne that followed, he made good. Then, after the Bulls
    won their second championship 12 months later, Jordan did it again. Perhaps unwilling
    to displease or otherwise disturb the hidden cosmic operations that had delivered
    him to the apex of the basketball world, he made the gift into a ritual: After
    the final buzzer sounded on each of the six titles he won with the Bulls, he’d
    pull off one of his shoes, sign it, and hand it over to Hallam.'

    has been available for purchase. Last March, Sotheby’s sent the same shoes out
    on tour to chum the waters for a private sale. They stopped in cities known for
    billionaire foot traffic: Hong Kong, Singapore, Dubai. A prominent collector told
    *The Wall Street Journal* that they would go for at least $20 million. He indicated
    that he would not be surprised if they fetched *$100 million*. Those predictions
    do not appear to have panned out, because Sotheby’s now has the shoes back on
    the block for just $7–10 million. Maybe the timing for these sales has been off.
    The sports-memorabilia market has certainly come off its pandemic highs. Or maybe,
    after a nearly 10-year boom, the mystique of the Jordan brand has begun to dim.'

- en: Jordan is arguably the most successful male model in history. His brand first
    became a force in the 1980s, during his early playing career, when he embodied
    cool in his physique and in nearly everything that he wore. The first shoe to
    bear his name, the Jordan 1, was released in 1985, when “signature shoes for basketball
    players weren't really a thing,” says Russ Bengtson, the author of *A History
    of Basketball in 15 Sneakers*. It brought in $126 million in revenue. Sneakerheads
    will talk about a shoe’s “silhouette,” its three-dimensional shape stripped of
    color and texture. The Jordan 1 had the sweetest silhouette in sneaker history
    when it debuted, and may never have relinquished that title. That’s why people
    still feel comfortable wearing Jordan 1s, not only with basketball shorts, but
    with jeans, skirts, dresses, or suits. No other basketball player has so successfully
    transformed a shoe built for the court into a staple of everyday casual gear.
    Following his untimely death, Kobe Bryant’s shoes have become particularly popular,
    Bengtson told me. But people don’t wear Kobes—or LeBrons—for trips to the grocery
    store *and* the [presidential inauguration](https://www.gq.com/story/air-jordan-1-diors-inauguration)

  zh: 乔丹可以说是历史上最成功的男模特。他的品牌最初在上世纪80年代成为一股力量，当时他在职业生涯初期就以其体型和几乎所有穿着都体现出酷感。第一双以他名字命名的鞋子，乔丹1号，于1985年发售，“那时‘篮球球员签名鞋’并不是一件大事”，《15双球鞋的篮球史》作者Russ
    Bengtson说。它带来了1.26亿美元的收入。鞋迷们会谈论一双鞋的“轮廓”，即剥离颜色和质地的三维形状。乔丹1号在首次亮相时拥有了运动鞋历史上最甜美的轮廓，并且可能永远不会放弃这个称号。这就是为什么人们仍然愿意穿乔丹1号，不仅是与篮球短裤搭配，还可以与牛仔裤、裙子、连衣裙或西装搭配。没有其他篮球运动员能够如此成功地将一双为球场而设计的鞋子转变为日常休闲装的必备品。Kobe
    Bryant去世后，他的鞋子变得特别受欢迎，Bengtson告诉我。但人们不会像乔丹一样，无论是去杂货店还是[总统就职典礼](https://www.gq.com/story/air-jordan-1-diors-inauguration)都穿科比或勒布朗的鞋子。
- en: Jordan released 17 more shoes before he retired from the NBA in 2003, and they
    continued to be popular while he was playing. After he stopped playing, the brand’s
    signature shoes became less popular, Dittrich says. Fans weren’t yet nostalgic
    for Jordan at his greatest with the Bulls. They were still seeing the afterimages
    of his more human closing years with the Washington Wizards, when he was merely
    good for his age. Jordan struggled to remain a symbol of pure victory in retirement.

    object long before the white cultural mainstream tuned in. Hobbyists, primarily
    from the hip-hop community, had for decades been collecting the most beautiful
    and resonant basketball sneakers. But the market for these shoes was small and
    fragmented. In the mid-2010s, two dedicated online marketplaces—StockX and GOAT—launched,

    it played like an eight-hour commercial for his greatness. On the first three
    Sundays when episodes aired, traffic to Jordan shoes on StockX increased by more
    than 60 percent. Nike saw an opportunity, Bengtson said, and fire-hosed retro

- en: But by the time *Air* made it to the big screen last May, the fervor for retro
    Jordans was already starting to fade. Bengtson blames Nike for flooding the market.
    “There are just so many releases every single week,” he said. Tastemakers have
    noted the glut. The fashion newsletter Blackbird Spyplane recently placed retro
    Jordans at their “Lowest Point of Coolness ever,” especially in “non-O.G. colors,
    but also, sorry, just all of them … [[Jordans] have never looked as costumey &
    washed on foot](https://www.blackbirdspyplane.com/p/spyplane-best-of-2023-slappy-awards).”
    The resale market has also shown strong symptoms of Jordan fatigue. In 2022, the
    release premium on new Jordan 1 colorways dipped to 23 percent, Dittrich told
    me. (Anecdotally, my son, who does some light reselling, reported this same downswing.)
    Through the first half of 2023, Jordan 1s actually resold at a 2 percent *discount*.

  zh: 但是到了去年五月，《*Air*》上映时，对复古乔丹鞋的热情已经开始褪去。Bengtson责怪耐克对市场进行了过度投放。“每周都有太多的发布活动，”他说道。品位导向者们已经注意到了这种过剩。时尚简报《Blackbird
    Spyplane》最近将复古乔丹鞋列为他们“有史以来最不酷的时刻”，尤其是“非原始颜色，但也包括，抱歉，所有颜色……[【乔丹鞋】在脚上从未看起来如此装饰 &
    淡薄](https://www.blackbirdspyplane.com/p/spyplane-best-of-2023-slappy-awards)。”转售市场也显示出了对乔丹鞋的疲劳症状。Dittrich告诉我，2022年，新款乔丹1号配色的发售溢价降至23％。（据我所知，我儿子，做了一些轻微转售的人，也报告了这种下降。）到2023年上半年，乔丹1号实际上以2％的折扣价格转售。
- en: No trend can last forever. Fashion is cyclical. The question is whether we can
    expect Jordan fever to return, and whether it will be as intense the next time
    it strikes. Bengtson is bearish. “We’re moving further away from Jordan’s playing
    career,” he told me. “It’s gone from consumers having direct memory of watching
    him play, to stories from older brothers and friends, to stories from parents.”
    Jordan’s highlight packages still do numbers on TikTok, but there is something
    qualitatively different about consuming an algorithmic drip feed of 30-year-old
    clips while you’re on your iPhone in bed. That’s not an experience that imprints
    visceral memories. Gen Xers and even some Millennials can remember where they
    were when Jordan [elevated](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1ChoqrQCrE), according
    to some higher physics, and stuck a game winner on the Cleveland Cavaliers’ Craig
    Ehlo. They can still hear the involuntary way that announcer Marv Albert’s voice
    rose—[“ a *spectacular* move”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IiSdb16N_Dg)—as

    know Jordan’s shoes. They know the formally elegant Jumpman logo. But they may
    not know much about the man himself. If the brand is going to capture a new generation,
    it will need to put out fresh products, Dittrich said: “They can’t keep leaning

- en: It’s not clear whether this latest swoon has been (or will remain) a drag on
    the dynasty collection’s value. A mass-market fashion brand has to cater to fickle
    youth, but Sotheby’s doesn’t. Today’s top memorabilia buyers come from the older
    generations, who watched Jordan in his prime. Having just made partner or sold
    a business, they may be newly inclined to see something of themselves in Jordan’s
    story. In September 2022, a jersey that Jordan wore in the first game of his last
    NBA Finals went up for auction. It was estimated to sell for “only” $5 million,
    but the bidding war was more intense than anticipated, and it ultimately went
    for a higher price—$10.1 million—than even the jersey that Diego Maradona wore
    while scoring his “Hand of God” goal in the 1986 World Cup. The Jordan jersey,

  zh: 最近这种疲软是否对这个王朝收藏的价值构成了拖累，尚不清楚。大众市场时尚品牌必须迎合善变的年轻人，但苏富比并不需要。如今的顶级纪念品买家主要来自年长一代，他们在乔丹巅峰时期观看了他的比赛。他们可能刚刚成为合伙人或出售了一家企业，因此可能新近倾向于在乔丹的故事中看到自己的影子。2022年9月，乔丹在他最后一个NBA总决赛中穿过的球衣被拍卖。估计售价“只有”500万美元，但竞标战比预期更激烈，最终以1010万美元的高价成交，甚至比迭戈·马拉多纳在1986年世界杯上打进“上帝之手”进球时穿的球衣的价格还高。这件乔丹球衣并没有来自特别显著的比赛，但现在是有史以来售价最高的比赛用球衣。
- en: Recent sales of Jordan’s shoes haven’t come close to that jersey’s selling price,
    despite how central they are to his mythology. Last April, a pair that he wore
    in his last NBA Finals sold for $2.2 million, a record for sneakers but the bottom
    end of its estimated range. The ones that he wore during his famous “flu game”
    also recently came up for auction. Any basketball fan above a certain age can
    easily summon to mind the image of a sickened and exhausted Jordan slumping over
    onto Scottie Pippen on his way to the bench, having just gutted out 38 points.
    But the shoes that were on his feet at that moment sold for only $1.4 million.
    Perhaps footwear just doesn’t pop like a jersey on the illuminated wall of a plutocrat’s
    man cave. Or perhaps the very popularity of the Air Jordan brand, its continual
    reinvention and readoption by the young, has widened the psychic distance between
    the shoes and the original experience of Michael Jordan. Older collectors bid
    up his jersey because it reminds them of how he played the game. The shoes may
    now seem like trendy objects, artifacts that belong more squarely to the history
    of fashion than to basketball.

  zh: 近期乔丹鞋的销售价格远远不及那件球衣的售价，尽管它们对于他的神话来说非常重要。去年四月，他在最后一个NBA总决赛中穿的一双鞋以220万美元的价格售出，创下了运动鞋的纪录，但位于其估价范围的底部。他在著名的“流感比赛”中穿的鞋最近也被拍卖。任何超过一定年龄的篮球迷都可以轻易地想起乔丹生病和筋疲力尽地倒在斯科蒂·皮蓬身上，刚刚拼尽全力得到38分的场景。但他当时穿的鞋仅售出140万美元。也许鞋类产品在财阀男人洞穴的照明墙上不像球衣那样引人注目。或者也许乔丹飞人品牌的非常受欢迎，其不断的改造和年轻人的重新接受，已经扩大了鞋子与迈克尔·乔丹原始体验之间的心理距离。年长的收藏家出价买乔丹的球衣是因为它让他们想起他如何打篮球。现在这些鞋子可能看起来像是时尚史而不是篮球史的一部分。
