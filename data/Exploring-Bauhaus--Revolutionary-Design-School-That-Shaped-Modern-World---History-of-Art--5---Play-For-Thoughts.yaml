- en: Mies van der Rohe brought his purist and perfectionist views to the Bauhaus,
    driven by a passion for order, clarity, and excellence. His initial action upon
    taking on the role of director was to eliminate individuals with political affiliations
    from the school.

  zh: 密斯·凡·德·罗带着他的纯主义和完美主义观念来到包豪斯，出于对秩序、清晰和卓越的热爱驱使。他在担任校长一职后的首要行动是清除那些具有政治倾向的个人。
- en: Under Mies van der Rohe's leadership, architectural studies were expanded, and
    it seemed that the school was gaining a new lease of life. However, van der Rohe
    had to confront a political situation far more serious than the one opposed by
    Gropius.

  zh: 在密斯·凡·德·罗（Mies van der Rohe）的领导下，建筑研究得到了扩展，学校似乎正在获得新的生机。然而，凡·德·罗不得不面对比格罗皮乌斯所反对的更为严重的政治局势。
- en: In August 1932, the Nazi party took control of the Anhalt province, where Dessau
    was located, and immediately initiated steps towards the closure of the Bauhaus.
    For the Nazis, the Bauhaus symbolized "Bolshevism," decadence, and subversion.
    Consequently, the Bauhaus in Dessau was closed in October 1932.

  zh: 1932年8月，纳粹党控制了位于德绍的安哈尔特省，并立即采取步骤关闭包豪斯。对纳粹来说，包豪斯象征着“布尔什维主义”、堕落和颠覆。因此，德绍的包豪斯于1932年10月关闭。
- en: However, Mies van der Rohe managed to reopen the school as a private institution
    in Berlin. He rented an abandoned telephone factory, and Bauhaus resumed its activities
    for what was to be a challenging six months.

    seized the school, conducted searches looking for evidence of communist activities,
    and banned students and lecturers from returning to the school.

    reopen the school, but he couldn't accept the conditions imposed on him. Thus,

- en: When Gropius was a little boy, homes were illuminated by gas, each room had
    a coal stove, and there were no electric trams, cars, or airplanes. Additionally,
    there wasn't even radio, film, a phonograph, or a telephone.

  zh: 当格罗皮乌斯还是个小男孩时，家里用煤气照明，每个房间都有煤炉，没有电车、汽车或飞机。此外，甚至没有无线电、电影、留声机或电话。
- en: The world in which Gropius grew up, even in 1919, seemed relatively simple,
    and the idea of planned environmental transformation was not an absolute utopia.
    However, over the next twenty years, there was such technological development
    that no reformers could keep pace with these changes.

  zh: 即使在1919年，格罗皮乌斯成长的世界似乎相对简单，计划中的环境转型的概念也不是绝对的乌托邦。然而，在接下来的二十年中，技术的发展如此迅速，以至于没有改革者能够跟上这些变化。
- en: Bauhaus, despite facing economic and political difficulties, made significant
    strides in this field. But, as Gropius stated, he couldn't act faster than the
    society he was meant to serve.

  zh: 尽管面临经济和政治困境，包豪斯在这一领域取得了显著进展。但正如格罗皮乌斯所述，他无法比他要为之服务的社会更快行动。
- en: Gropius, who merged 19th-century idealism with 20th-century realism, was convinced
    that the foundation of all reforms lies in education. However, views on what and
    how to teach evolved gradually as Bauhaus adapted to changes in the field of sociology.

  zh: 格罗皮乌斯将19世纪的理想主义与20世纪的现实主义融合在一起，他确信所有改革的基础在于教育。然而，关于教授什么和如何教的观念随着包豪斯适应社会学领域的变化而逐渐演变。
- en: In the 19th century, the idea emerged that it was possible to teach the artist
    skills that would create a formula unifying all branches of art, including architecture
    and design. This idea resurfaced in the 1920s in the debates among futurists and
    constructivists, and Bauhaus in Weimar was the first large-scale initiative aiming
    to put these theories into practice.

  zh: 19世纪时，出现了这样一个观念，即可以教导艺术家的技能，创造一个统一所有艺术分支（包括建筑与设计）的公式。这个想法在20世纪20年代再次浮现于未来派和构成主义者的讨论中，而威玛的包豪斯是首个大规模试图将这些理论付诸实践的倡议。
- en: Soon, it became apparent that reconciling the artist's ideals with industrial
    demands was not feasible and that new means of action were necessary to bridge
    the gap between art and technology. To find these means, Bauhaus developed a radical
    and revolutionary educational program.

- en: According to Bauhaus, the goal was not the product but the human being. Therefore,
    the profound humanism stemming from efforts to understand the psychological and
    physical needs of humans was Bauhaus's most valuable contribution to 20th-century
    architecture and design.
