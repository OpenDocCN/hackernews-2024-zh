- en: Steve began looking for her in earnest in his 20s, but the paper trail quickly
    ran cold. When he turned 40, he told his wife, Michelle, that he wanted to give
    the search one last go. This was in 2013\. AncestryDNA had started selling mail-in
    test kits the previous year, so he bought one. His matches at first seemed unpromising—some
    distant relatives—but when he began posting in a Facebook group for people seeking
    out biological family, he got connected to a genetic genealogist named CeCe Moore.
    Moore specializes in finding people via distant DNA matches, a technique made
    famous in 2018 when it led to the [capture of the Golden State Killer](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2018/04/golden-state-killer-east-area-rapist-dna-genealogy/559070/).

    well-off, their lives picture-perfect—“like a storybook,” Steve says. The other
    woman was unmarried; she didn’t have kids. She was not friends with her immediate

    first-degree relatives—a brother and a sister or a parent and a child. “That’s
    way, way more than I think many people would ever imagine,” he told me. And this

    many of these cases, though, she wanted people to know they were not alone. Moore
    ended up creating a private and invite-only support group on Facebook in 2016,

    less than 1 percent of the genome in Western populations, higher in cultures where
    cousin marriage is common. But that number is about 25 percent, Wilson said, in

    dad was not her biological dad. Their blood types were incompatible, and she heard
    rumors about her mother and grandfather. Although her mother’s family was violent
    and chaotic, she was close to her dad’s family, especially her granny on that
    side. “They’ve been my rock,” she told me. By the time Kathy took a DNA test confirming
    that her dad was not her biological dad, she had spent a lifetime distancing herself
    from her biological family and embracing one with whom she shared no DNA.

  zh: 凯西也是由她的母亲抚养长大的，尽管她很早就有一种直觉，认为她的爸爸不是她的亲生父亲。他们的血型不兼容，她听说关于她母亲和祖父的谣言。尽管她的母亲的家庭充满暴力和混乱，她与她父亲家庭尤其是那一边的祖母关系密切。“他们一直是我的支柱，”她告诉我。当凯西通过DNA测试确认她的爸爸不是她的亲生父亲时，她已经度过了一生远离她的生物家庭，并接受了一个与她没有DNA共享的家庭。
- en: Hers was, in some ways, the opposite journey of adoptees such as Steve, who
    wanted so badly to know his biological family. But the two of them have become
    close. Kathy remembers how angry he used to be on his mother’s behalf. She told
    him that she used to be angry too, but she had to leave it behind. “It’s not going
    to bring me any peace. It’s not going to bring my mother any peace,” she recalled
    saying. And it wouldn’t undo what had been done to his mother by her father or
    her brother so many years ago.

  zh: 在某些方面，凯西的旅程与史蒂夫等被领养者截然相反，他非常渴望了解他的生物家庭。但他们两个已经变得很亲密了。凯西记得他曾为他母亲感到多么愤怒。她告诉他，她以前也很生气，但她不得不放下这些。“这不会给我带来任何平静。这也不会给我的母亲带来任何平静，”她回忆说。而且多年前她的父亲或哥哥对他的母亲所做的事情也无法改变。

- en: In the end, Steve was able to identify his biological father, though not through
    any particular feat of genetic sleuthing. One day, two and a half years after
    his DNA test, he logged in to AncestryDNA and saw a parent match. It was his mother’s
    older brother. From the site, he could see that his father-uncle had logged in
    once, presumably seen that Steve was his son, and—even after Steve sent him a
    message—never logged back on again.

  zh: 最终，史蒂夫能够确认他的生物父亲，尽管不是通过任何特别的遗传侦探技巧。两年半后的一天，他登录到 AncestryDNA 并看到了一个亲属匹配。那是他母亲的哥哥。从网站上，他可以看到他的父亲兼叔叔登录过一次，可能看到史蒂夫是他的儿子，但甚至在史蒂夫给他发了消息后，他再也没有登录过。
- en: By then, his initial anger had started to dissipate. He still felt deeply for
    his birth mom. Michelle says that her husband has always been a sensitive guy—she
    makes fun of him for crying at movies—but he’s become even more empathetic. The
    feeling of worthlessness he initially struggled with has given way to a sense
    of purpose; he and Michelle now spend hours on the phone talking with others in
    the support group.

  zh: 那时，他最初的愤怒已经开始消散。他仍然对他的亲生母亲深有感触。米歇尔说她的丈夫一直是一个敏感的人——她取笑他在电影中哭泣——但他变得更加有同情心。他最初的无价值感已被一种目的感取代；他和米歇尔现在花费数小时与支持小组中的其他人通话。
- en: Steve has still never spoken to his birth mother. He tried writing to her a
    second time, sending a journal about his life—but she returned it unopened. He
    messages her occasionally on Facebook, sending photos of grandkids and puppies
    he’s raised. Every year, he wishes her a happy birthday. She has not replied,
    but she has also not blocked him.

  zh: 史蒂夫仍然从未与他的生母交谈过。他尝试第二次写信给她，寄去了一本关于他生活的日记——但她将其未拆开退回。他偶尔在Facebook上给她发信息，寄去孙子和他养的小狗的照片。每年，他都祝她生日快乐。她没有回复，但也没有屏蔽他。
- en: When the journal came back unopened, Steve decided to try messaging his mother’s
    cousin—the other woman he’d initially thought could be his birth mom. He yearned
    for some kind of connection with someone in his biological family. He wrote to
    the cousin about his mom—but not his dad—and she  actually replied. She told him
    that she and his mom had been close as children, Steve recounted, but she did
    not know about a pregnancy. To her, it had seemed like her cousin one day “fell
    off the face of the Earth,” he says. She agreed to read his journal, and the two
    of them soon began speaking on the phone about their families.

  zh: 当期刊未打开回来时，史蒂夫决定尝试联系他母亲的堂姐——他最初认为可能是他亲生母亲的那位女士。他渴望与生物家庭的某人建立某种联系。他向堂姐写了关于他的母亲的信，但没有提到他的父亲，她实际上回复了。史蒂夫回忆说，她告诉他，她和他的母亲在孩童时期很亲密，但她并不知道有过怀孕的事情。对她来说，她的表姐某天突然“从地球上消失了”，他说。她同意读他的日记，然后他们俩很快开始通过电话谈论他们的家庭。
- en: Months later, Steve felt like he could finally share the truth about his biological
    father, and the cousin again accepted him for who he was. They met for the first
    time in 2017 when she was visiting a nearby town, and she later invited Steve
    and Michelle to Thanksgiving. Last year, she extended another invitation to a
    large family gathering. Steve’s immediate biological family was not there, but
    hers was, and they all knew about him and his mom and his dad. They greeted him
    with hugs, and they took photos together as a family. “It felt like a relief,”
    he told me, like a burden had been lifted from him. In this family, he was not
    a secret.

  zh: 几个月后，史蒂夫觉得他终于可以分享关于他生物父亲的真相了，表姐再次接受了他的真实身份。她第一次在2017年访问附近的一个城镇时见到了他，后来她还邀请史蒂夫和米歇尔参加感恩节。去年，她再次邀请他们参加一次大型家庭聚会。史蒂夫的生物父母不在场，但她的家人都知道他、他的妈妈和他的爸爸。他们用拥抱迎接他，并且作为一个家庭一起拍照。“那感觉像是一种解脱，”他告诉我，像是他的一种负担被解除了。在这个家庭中，他不再是一个秘密。
