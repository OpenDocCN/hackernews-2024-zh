- en: The latest tech giant impacted by the economy is eBay, which [announced](https://www.ebayinc.com/stories/news/ensuring-ebays-long-term-success/)
    earlier today that it is reducing its workforce by around 1,000 roles. That apparently
    equates to roughly 9 percent of the company's full-time employees. US employees
    are asked to work from home on January 24, and those affected will be notified
    "shortly." Unlike [Discord](https://www.engadget.com/discord-lays-off-170-workers-in-latest-round-of-cuts-211541127.html)
    and [Riot Games](https://www.engadget.com/riot-games-is-laying-off-11-percent-of-its-workforce-globally-022034243.html),
    though, eBay's post stopped short at sharing severance or benefit details. The
    company also plans to scale back the number of contractors over the coming months.

  zh: 受经济影响的最新科技巨头是[eBay](https://www.ebayinc.com/stories/news/ensuring-ebays-long-term-success/)，今天早些时候宣布将裁员约
    1,000 人。这显然相当于该公司全职员工的约 9%。美国员工被要求于 1 月 24 日在家工作，受影响的员工将会在“不久后”收到通知。然而，与[Discord](https://www.engadget.com/discord-lays-off-170-workers-in-latest-round-of-cuts-211541127.html)和[Riot
    Games](https://www.engadget.com/riot-games-is-laying-off-11-percent-of-its-workforce-globally-022034243.html)不同，eBay的帖子没有透露赔偿金或福利细节。该公司还计划在未来几个月减少合同工人的数量。

    and [Google](https://www.engadget.com/google-ceo-says-more-layoffs-expected-throughout-the-year-in-internal-memo-044016588.html)
    from earlier this month, which doesn't paint a pretty picture for the [tech scene](https://www.engadget.com/linkedins-new-ai-feature-helps-people-find-jobs-by-grouping-them-into-tailored-categories-104032853.html)
    right at the beginning of 2024\. Like its peers, eBay blamed this round of layoff
    on having hired too many people in recent years. "While we are making progress
    against our strategy, our overall headcount and expenses have outpaced the growth
    of our business," president and CEO Jamie Iannone said in the memo. Hopefully
    LinkedIn's new [AI-powered categorization tool](https://www.engadget.com/linkedins-new-ai-feature-helps-people-find-jobs-by-grouping-them-into-tailored-categories-104032853.html)
    will come in handy for those in need.

  zh: eBay 的裁员规模与本月早些时候的[Unity](https://www.engadget.com/unity-is-cutting-a-quarter-of-its-workforce-074331467.html)和[Google](https://www.engadget.com/google-ceo-says-more-layoffs-expected-throughout-the-year-in-internal-memo-044016588.html)相当，这对

    将此次裁员归咎于近年来招聘过多人员。“虽然我们在执行战略方面取得了进展，但我们的总人数和支出已经超过了业务增长，”总裁兼首席执行官 Jamie Iannone
    在备忘录中说。希望 LinkedIn 的新[基于人工智能的分类工具](https://www.engadget.com/linkedins-new-ai-feature-helps-people-find-jobs-by-grouping-them-into-tailored-categories-104032853.html)对有需要的人有所帮助。
