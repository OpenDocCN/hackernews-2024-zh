    began his [reign at Twitter](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/08/28/elon-musks-shadow-rule)
    with an elaborately staged pun. On Wednesday, October 26, 2022, he posted a [tweet](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1585341984679469056)
    with a video that showed him carrying a sink through the lobby of the company’s
    San Francisco headquarters. “Entering Twitter HQ—let that sink in!” he wrote.
    At the time, I was a coder for Twitter’s language-infrastructure team. (If you’ve
    ever used Twitter’s translation feature, or are using Twitter in a language other
    than English, that was us.) I saw Musk’s tweet when it was shared in a company-wide
    Slack channel. He looked like a giddy warlord entering an enemy stronghold he’d
    besieged for months.

    with its head of legal, policy, and trust. Originally, the acquisition had been
    slated to close on Friday, but Musk pulled a switcheroo by “fast-closing” the
    deal on Thursday afternoon. This maneuver allowed him to fire the executives “for

    see its visual language, you’ll recognize it everywhere.) And countless useful
    tools had been built by other programmers using Twitter’s A.P.I., or application-programming
    interface—a way for outsiders to make use of Twitter’s data. Among other things,
    the A.P.I. allowed people to create automated accounts, from New New York Times,
    which tweeted “words when they appear in the NYT the 1st time,” to SF QuakeBot,

    decisions were usually made from the bottom up, or with careful A/B testing. But
    now there seems to be one “product person”—Musk—who is singularly unequipped to
    imagine what a typical Twitter user might want. On Twitter, users construct different
    gestalts of the platform through their own feedback and engagement; in this respect,
    Musk’s usage pattern is many standard deviations away from what’s ordinary. Click
    on any of his tweets to read the replies, and you’ll find an entropic mix of flattery,
    belligerent language, memes, and product shilling. Imagine the maelstrom of likes
    and mentions he gets every millisecond. There’s nothing “standard” about Musk’s
