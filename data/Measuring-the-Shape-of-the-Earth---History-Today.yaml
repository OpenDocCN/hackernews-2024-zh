    in the Bastille, or exile in England. After sailing across the Channel, he landed
    in another universe. Before leaving France, he declared, he had lived in a world
    that was full – but as soon as he arrived in England, he found one that was empty.
    It even looked different: ‘In Paris you see the Earth shaped like a melon; in
    London it is flattened on two sides.’ According to conventional French science,
    the Earth was stretched out, elongated so that its circumference around the Equator
    was shorter than around the poles. But Isaac Newton disagreed. Under his influence,
    English experts had come to hold the opposite view: that the Earth is squashed
    like a pumpkin, bulging out slightly in the middle.'

  zh: 1726年，伏尔泰面临一个并不太难的选择：在巴士底狱中无审判监禁，或者流放到英国。渡过英吉利海峡后，他降落到另一个宇宙。在离开法国之前，他宣称他曾生活在一个充满的世界
    - 但一到英国，他发现这里空无一物。甚至外观也不同：“在巴黎，你看到地球像一个甜瓜形状；在伦敦，它是两面扁平的。” 根据传统的法国科学观点，地球被拉长，使得赤道周长比两极周长要短。但艾萨克·牛顿持不同意见。在他的影响下，英国专家们持有相反的观点：地球像南瓜一样扁平，中间略微鼓出。
