    that was no longer available on the service and having to do that sums up one
    of the many problems with music streaming services. It's not really your collection

- en: I have a similar fear about albums I've purchased on Bandcamp disappearing after
    the company was sold (yet again). I've developed the habit of downloading my purchases
    there as 320kbps mp3s and FLAC files for archiving. That archive lives on a hard
    drive velcroed to the back of my monitor and gets mirrored to a remote backup.
    I worry about that drive failing, but I'll have the backup.

  zh: 我对在Bandcamp购买的专辑消失后的担忧与此类似，因为公司再次被出售。我已经养成了下载我在那里购买的320kbps mp3和FLAC文件以进行归档的习惯。这个归档保存在固定在我的显示器背后的硬盘上，并且备份到远程。我担心那个硬盘会坏掉，但我会有备份。
- en: I still have remnants of my old CD collection, but I did sell quite a few CDs
    to Amoeba in Hollywood when I needed the money. I regretted it for a time, but
    I had digital copies and, in hindsight, don't think I'd want to store them all
    now. The only device I have to play them now is an old Blu-ray player sitting
    in our entertainment center.

  zh: 我仍然保留着我旧CD收藏的残余，但是当我需要钱的时候，我确实卖掉了好几张CD给好莱坞的Amoeba。有一段时间我为此感到后悔，但我有数字副本，并且事后来看，我现在也不认为我想要把它们全部存储起来。我现在唯一能播放它们的设备是一个老旧的蓝光播放器，它坐落在我们的娱乐中心里。
- en: I've [streamed my own music](/posts/2023/i-dont-want-streaming-music/) and that
    was mostly fine — you keep your library, upload it and access it. It wasn't quite

- en: I'm [listening to my music locally now](/posts/2023/locally-stored-music-and-storage-as-a-meaningful-constraint/)

- en: I don't have to worry about a streaming service going down, a license agreement
    lapsing, metadata shifting as a service updates it's catalogue (how many entries
    in your library have been replaced by some unnecessary remaster?). There's a degree
    of maintenance, but what I listen to isn't constrained by a service I rent my
    collection from and hope doesn't go away.

- en: I'll freely admit that I have listening habits that don't align with the way
    streaming services (Spotify in particular) present music. I've *never* become
    accustomed to playlists and will, instead, put on full albums in a queue. I've
    only ever browsed playlists of new releases as a means to find new albums I may
    have missed (to be listened to in full). I keep a calendar of upcoming albums
    and, again, archive them and listen to them. If I'm dissatisfied with a release,
    I remove it from my library and keep it in my archive.

  zh: 我可以毫不掩饰地承认，我的听音习惯与流媒体服务（特别是Spotify）提供音乐的方式不符合。我从未习惯过播放列表，而是会把整张专辑加入队列。我只会浏览新发行的播放列表，以找出可能错过的新专辑（要完整地听一遍）。我会记录即将发行的专辑，并将它们存档并听听。如果对某个专辑不满意，我会将其从我的库中移除并保留在存档中。
- en: Maybe listening via playlists that are designed to fit a mood lets you move
    with a shifting catalogue, the playlist remains updated as releases fall out of
    the broader catalogue and that rot in what you're renting goes unnoticed. I find
    myself, instead, looking for albums that fit a mood or putting new releases on
    repeat to commit the nuances of an album to memory. If I'm reading or working
    I drift towards extreme metal where the lyrics are unintelligible and don't distract.
    If I'm cooking or doing something that requires less focus, intelligible lyrics
    return and I'll settle into Tom Waits' earlier work or something newer and acoustic.

  zh: 或许通过设计以适应心情的播放列表来聆听，让你随着不断变化的目录移动，这些播放列表随着发布的作品从更广泛的目录中移出而更新，你租用的内容就不会引起注意。相反，我会寻找适合心情的专辑，或者重复播放新发布的内容，以记住专辑的细微差别。如果我在阅读或工作，我倾向于听听极端金属，其中歌词不可理解，不会分散注意力。如果我在做饭或做一些需要较少专注的事情，我会选择听汤姆·韦茨（Tom
    Waits）早期的作品或者一些新的原声音乐。
- en: I don't change what I listen to all that much and it's rare that a new artist
    lands in my collection. I'm not as interested in a new band that sounds like an
    old one when I can go back and listen to the band that originated that sound.
    Maybe I'm just old (that's fine too!).

- en: Streaming is, unarguably, convenient — but, it means you no longer have a collection
    you control. It means that what you can listen to is subject to the financial
    concerns of the streaming platform and it means that artists get paid less and
    less as streaming rates change. I don't have a compelling solution and, perhaps,
    one isn't needed given how widely adopted and accepted streaming is. I know I've
    lost interest in the model and I'm concerned for music (and media broadly) as
    it becomes commodified and availability remains a moving target.

  zh: 无可争议地，流媒体服务很方便 —— 但这意味着你再也不拥有自己控制的音乐收藏。这意味着你能听的内容受流媒体平台的财务考量影响，也意味着随着流媒体费率的变动，艺术家的收入越来越少。我没有一个令人信服的解决方案，也许在流媒体广泛应用和接受的情况下，并不需要解决方案。我知道我对这种模式失去了兴趣，我也对音乐（以及媒体广泛地）成为商品化并保持可获得性感到担忧。
