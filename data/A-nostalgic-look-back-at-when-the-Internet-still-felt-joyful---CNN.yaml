    Google was just one of several mainstream search engines, not yeta monopolistic
    empire. Dial-up internet (and its iconic dial tone) was [still a thing](https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2006/05/28/part-1-broadband-adoption-in-the-united-states/)
    in many American homes. File-sharing services like Napster and LimeWire were just
    beginning to take off. MP3 players and advances in 3D graphics represented brand-new

    their desktop monitors together to set up a local area network (LAN) and play
    multiplayer games — “Half-Life,” “Counter-Strike,” “Starsiege: Tribes,” “StarCraft,”
    “WarCraft” or “Unreal Tournament,” to name just a few. These were informal but
    high-stakes gatherings, then known as LAN parties, whether winning a box of energy
    drinks or just the joy of emerging victorious.'

    subculture to a [multi-billion dollar industry](https://www.statista.com/topics/868/video-games/)
    that is less about getting together in person and more about a wider web of e-sports

    the era’s gaming culture in her new photobook “LAN Party.” After floating the
    idea on X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter, she received an

    with excitement. “I think everyone has some kind of nostalgia for a period before
    they were alive,” K told CNN. “I had people who are 20 years old, who were tweeting
    and being like,‘I was born in the wrong decade.’”

- en: Throughout the pages of “LAN Party,” there is an all-too evocative sense of
    fernweh — fond, wistful memories for a pastime in times past. It’s strange to
    remember that the internet was once a place you went to spend time with other
    *real* people; a tethered space, not a cling-film-like reality enveloping the
    corporeal world from your own pocket.

  zh: 在“局域网聚会”的页页中，都有一种过于令人怀念的fernweh（对往昔时光中一种深情怀念的感觉）。记得互联网曾经是你去与其他*真实*人交流的地方，这感觉很奇怪；一个被系在一起的空间，而不是从你的口袋里包裹现实的保鲜膜一样。
- en: “That time — the late ’90s, early 2000s — was pre-social media,” K said. “It’s
    the era of blogs and forums. No one really had 24/7 access. So even though we
    were starting to get high-speed internet, it was still a place that you went,
    rather than just another part of your life. And this feeling of connecting to
    people in other parts of the world was cool. It wasn’t something that was taken
    for granted yet.”

  zh: “那个时代——90年代末、2000年初——是社交媒体之前的时代，” K 说。“那时是博客和论坛的时代。没有人真的能够24/7地接触网络。所以即使我们开始有高速互联网，它仍然是你去的一个地方，而不是你生活中的另一部分。与世界其他地方的人联系的这种感觉很酷。当时这并不是理所当然的事情。”
- en: Growing up as a teenager in this era, you could feel a sense of hope (that perhaps
    now feels like naivete) about the possibilities of technology, K explained. The
    book is full of photos featuring people smiling and posing with their desktop
    monitors, pride and fanfare apparent. At that point in time, many new tech products
    were designed with ostentatious playfulness in mind — cellphones were often [blinged
    out](https://www.pinterest.com/pin/198369558580619093/) or swiveled up, cameras
    came in [hot pink shells](https://www.etsy.com/listing/1317004963/vintage-2000s-pink-digital-camera)

- en: “It felt like, ‘Wow, the future is coming,’” K said. “It was this exciting time
    where you felt like you were just charting your own way. I don’t want to romanticize
    it too much, because obviously it wasn’t perfect, but it was a very, very different
    experience.”

- en: It was also a new era for photography. Digital cameras — with which most of
    the photos in “LAN Party” were taken — had just become widely available to the
    public. As a result, the visuals are grainy, unedited and generally low quality
    by today’s standards. Documenting everyday life through images was still an anomaly,
    after all, K said. As such, people in the book’s photos weren’t yet conscious
    of their best angles, nor does it seem they were necessarily trying to look ‘good’
    for the camera.

  zh: 这也是摄影的一个新时代。数码相机——“局域网聚会”中的大部分照片都是用它们拍摄的——刚刚开始普及到公众手中。因此，这些视觉图像在今天的标准下显得颗粒感强、未经编辑、通常质量低。通过图像记录日常生活在当时仍然是一种反常现象，K
    说。因此，书中的照片中的人们尚未意识到自己的最佳角度，看起来也不一定在为镜头“打扮得漂亮”。
- en: “Some people are just making goofy faces, flipping the camera off,” K said.
    “No one really knows how to be in a selfie yet. When digital cameras show up,
    it starts to become a much more everyday thing… people are figuring out, ‘How
    do I look in this picture? What do I do?’”

- en: Of course, many of the photos also portend what was to come. They also contain
    early footprints of modern gamer culture stereotypes — dank, antisocial and seemingly
    unhealthy environments. (Despite gaming’s global popularity, today it is sometimes
    characterized as the domain of young White men, internalizing and disseminating
    racist, misogynistic or right-wing politics.)

- en: Still, “it was a little more communal,” K said. “If you’re playing games in
    the same room with someone, it’s a different experience than doing it online.
    You can only be so much of a jackass to somebody who was sitting three feet away
    from you, whereas today with online games, toxicity is a huge problem. Being anonymous
    online can inspire the worst in people.”

  zh: 尽管如此，“这在某种程度上更像是一个集体的体验，” K说道。“如果你和别人在同一个房间里玩游戏，与在线游戏完全是两种不同的体验。你不可能对着坐在你三英尺远处的人太过无礼，而如今的在线游戏则存在严重的毒性问题。在网上匿名可以激发人们最糟糕的一面。”
- en: Though they have significantly dwindled in frequency, LAN parties do still take
    place. (They have also maintained their status over the years as cultural iconography;
