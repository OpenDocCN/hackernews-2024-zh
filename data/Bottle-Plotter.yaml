- en: I have noticed that, it is quite common in group of small wine producers, that
    they don't use bottle labels. Usually they just draw some basic info on the bottle
    with special (**Edding**) paint marker. That is how I got this idea. Everybody
    can get paper label printed, but what about bottle plotter. CNC that would used
    paint marker as plotter to plot the label directly on the bottle. And with tool-changer
    you could also have more colors.

    forced to drive for 2h alone in car back home. I never tried this while driving,
