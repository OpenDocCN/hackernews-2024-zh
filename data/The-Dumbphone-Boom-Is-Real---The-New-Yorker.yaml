- en: 'Will Stults spent too much time on his iPhone, doom-scrolling the site formerly
    known as Twitter and tweeting angrily at Elon Musk as if the billionaire would
    actually notice. Stults’s partner, Daisy Krigbaum, was addicted to Pinterest and
    YouTube, bingeing videos on her iPhone before going to sleep. Two years ago, they
    both tried Apple’s Screen Time restriction tool and found it too easy to disable,
    so the pair decided to trade out their iPhones for more low-tech devices. They’d
    heard about so-called dumbphones, which lacked the kinds of bells and whistles—a
    high-resolution screen, an app store, a video camera—that made smartphones so
    addictive. But they found the process of acquiring one hard to navigate. “The
    information on it was kind of disparate and hard to get to. A lot of people who
    know the most about dumbphones spend the least time online,” Krigbaum said. A
    certain irony presented itself: figuring out a way to be less online required
    aggressive online digging.'

  zh: Will Stults 在他的 iPhone 上花费了太多时间，在以前被称为 Twitter 的网站上滚动无意义的内容，并愤怒地在 Elon Musk
    的推特下留言，仿佛亿万富翁真的会注意到。Stults 的伴侣 Daisy Krigbaum 对 Pinterest 和 YouTube 上瘾，睡前会在 iPhone
    上 binge 观看视频。两年前，他们尝试了苹果的屏幕使用时间限制工具，发现很容易被禁用，于是他们决定将他们的 iPhones 换成更低技术含量的设备。他们听说过所谓的“愚蠢手机”，这些手机没有高分辨率屏幕、应用商店和摄像头等让智能手机如此令人上瘾的功能。但他们发现获取一部愚蠢手机的过程很难。“上面的信息有点零散，很难获取。最了解愚蠢手机的人通常在线时间最少，”Krigbaum
    说道。一种讽刺呈现出来：找到少上网的方法需要大量的在线挖掘。
- en: The couple—Stults is twenty-nine, and Krigbaum is twenty-five—saw a business
    opportunity. “If somebody could condense it and simplify it to the best options,
    maybe more people would make the switch,” Krigbaum said. In late 2022, they launched
    an e-commerce company, Dumbwireless, to sell phones, data plans, and accessories
    for people who want to reduce time spent on their screens. This wasn’t Stults’s
    first attempt at entrepreneurship; his past efforts included a made-in-America
    clothing brand in Colorado (“That went under,” he said) and a coffee shop in the
    back of an ill-attended Hollywood comedy club (“A doomed enterprise,” Krigbaum
    said). Dumbwireless, however, has been much more successful.

  zh: 这对夫妇——Stults 今年二十九岁，Krigbaum 今年二十五岁——看到了一个商业机会。“如果有人能把信息压缩并简化到最佳选择，也许更多人会做出改变，”Krigbaum
    说道。2022 年末，他们推出了一家电子商务公司 Dumbwireless，出售手机、数据套餐和配件，为那些希望减少在屏幕上花费时间的人提供服务。这不是 Stults
    的创业首次尝试；他之前尝试过在科罗拉多州创立一个美国制造的服装品牌（“那个失败了，”他说），以及在一家参观者稀少的好莱坞喜剧俱乐部后面的咖啡店（“一个注定失败的企业，”Krigbaum
    说）。然而，Dumbwireless 取得了更大的成功。
- en: The couple’s home, in East Los Angeles, has turned into a kind of dumbphone
    emporium, with five hundred boxed devices stacked up in what was supposed to be
    a dining room. Stults takes business calls on his personal cell, and on one recent
    morning the first call came at 5 *A.M.* (As the lead on customer service, he has
    to use a smartphone—go figure.) They pack each order by hand, sometimes with handwritten
    notes. They have not yet quit their day jobs, which are in the service industry,
    but Dumbwireless sold more than seventy thousand dollars’ worth of products last
    month, ten times more than in March, 2023\. Krigbaum and Stults noticed an acceleration
    in sales last October, which they speculate may have had something to do with
    the onslaught of holiday-shopping season. Some of their popular phone offerings
    include the Light Phone, an e-ink device with almost no apps; the Nokia 2780,
    a traditional flip phone; and the Punkt., a calculator-ish Swiss device that looks
    like something designed for Neo to carry in “The Matrix” (which, to be fair, is
    a movie of the dumbphone era).

  zh: 在东洛杉矶的一对夫妇家中，他们的家变成了一种老式手机的集散地，有五百台装箱的设备堆积在原本应该是餐厅的地方。斯塔尔兹用他的个人手机接商务电话，最近的一个早上第一个电话在早上5点钟响起（作为客服的负责人，他必须使用智能手机——想象一下）。他们手工包装每一份订单，有时还附上手写的便条。他们尚未辞去在服务行业的日常工作，但是Dumbwireless上个月销售了超过七万美元的产品，是2023年3月的十倍。克里格鲍姆和斯塔尔兹注意到去年十月销售加速增长，他们推测这可能与节日购物季的来临有关。其中一些受欢迎的手机产品包括Light
    Phone，一款几乎没有应用的电子墨水设备；诺基亚2780，一款传统翻盖手机；以及Punkt.，一款看起来像为“黑客帝国”中的尼奥设计的瑞士计算器式设备（公平地说，这是一部老式手机时代的电影）。
- en: The growing dumbphone fervor may be motivated, in part, by the discourse around
    child safety online. Parents are increasingly confronted with [evidence](https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/the-case-for-banning-children-from-social-media)
    that sites like Instagram and TikTok intentionally try to hook their children.
    Using those sites can increase teens’ anxiety and lower their self-esteem, according
    to some studies, and smartphones make it so that kids are logged on constantly.
    Why should this situation be any healthier [for adults](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/annals-of-inquiry/we-know-less-about-social-media-than-we-think)?
    After almost two decades with iPhones, the public seems to be experiencing a collective

    We lack the self-control to wean ourselves off, so we crave devices that actively

    technology and into what Cal Newport, a contributing writer for *The New Yorker*,
    has called a more considered “[digital minimalism](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/04/29/what-it-takes-to-put-your-phone-away).”

- en: 'The Light Phone débuted in 2017, before smartphone exhaustion became a mainstream
    ailment. The company’s co-founders, Kaiwei Tang and Joe Hollier, have sold tens
    of thousands of phones. The Light Phone II, released in 2019, features a monochrome
    touch screen that allows users to make calls, send text messages, and use a few
    custom apps: an alarm and timer, a calendar, directions, notes, music and podcast
    libraries. There are no social-media apps or streaming apps. “The point is to
    create useful utility that does not have the attention economy built in,” Tang
    said. Like Dumbwireless, Light Phone has recently been experiencing a surge in
    demand. From 2022 to 2023, its revenue doubled, and it is on track to double again
    in 2024, the founders told me. Hollier pointed to Jonathan Haidt’s new book, “[The
    Anxious Generation](https://www.amazon.com/Anxious-Generation-Rewiring-Childhood-Epidemic/dp/0593655036),”
    about the [adverse effects of smartphones on adolescents](https://www.newyorker.com/books/under-review/can-we-get-kids-off-smartphones).
    Light Phone is receiving increased inquiries and bulk-order requests from churches,
    schools, and after-school programs. In September, 2022, the company began a partnership
    with a private school in Williamstown, Massachusetts, to provide Light Phones
    to the institution’s staff members and students; smartphones are now prohibited
    on campus. According to the school, the experiment has had a salutary effect both
    on student classroom productivity and on campus social life. Tang told me, “We’re
    talking to twenty to twenty-five schools now.”'

  zh: '[Light Phone](https://www.lightphone.com/)于2017年首次亮相，早在智能手机疲劳成为主流问题之前。该公司的联合创始人凯威·唐和乔·霍利尔已经销售了数万部手机。2019年推出的Light
    Phone II配备了单色触摸屏，用户可以拨打电话、发送短信，并使用几款定制应用程序：闹钟和计时器、日历、导航、备忘录、音乐和播客库。没有社交媒体应用或流媒体应用。“关键是创建没有注意力经济的有用工具”，唐说。像Dumbwireless一样，Light
    Phone最近经历了需求激增。创始人告诉我，从2022年到2023年，其收入翻了一番，目前正朝着2024年再次翻番的目标迈进。霍利尔指出乔纳森·海德特的新书，《[焦虑的一代](https://www.amazon.cn/焦虑的一代-重塑儿童时代的疫情-海德特/dp/0593655036)》，讨论了[智能手机对青少年的不良影响](https://www.newyorker.com/books/under-review/can-we-get-kids-off-smartphones)。Light
    Phone正收到越来越多来自教堂、学校和课后项目的询问和批量订单请求。2022年9月，公司开始与马萨诸塞州威廉斯敦的一所私立学校合作，为该校的教职员工和学生提供Light
    Phone；校园内现已禁止使用智能手机。学校表示，这一实验不仅对学生课堂生产力有益，也对校园社交生活有积极影响。唐告诉我：“我们现在正在与二十到二十五所学校进行对话。”'
- en: To Tang and Hollier’s surprise, some of the most willing Light Phone converts
    are Gen Z-ers. Some of them are younger than the iPhone. Digital technology has
    been an inevitable feature of their lives, yet they are also better equipped,
    or better motivated, than generations past to confront its negative impacts. Apple
    recently allowed third-party developers to write software that accesses the iPhone’s
    Screen Time function, meaning that some new programs can now help users limit
    their screen time by blocking apps. T. J. Driver and Zach Nasgowitz, two engineers
    in their early twenties, took advantage of this change to create an iPhone accessory
    called Brick, to fight their own excessive phone usage. Brick, which launched
    in September of 2023, is a magnetized plastic cube with a corresponding app that
    allows you to select which features you want to block on your smartphone. Tapping
    the brick activates or lifts the blockage. Driver and Nasgowitz started with one
    3-D printer to produce the accessories; now they have fifteen machines running
    around the clock and are shipping a few hundred products a day.

  zh: 令唐和霍利尔惊讶的是，一些最愿意使用Light Phone的人是Z世代。其中一些人比iPhone还年轻。数字技术已经成为他们生活中不可避免的特征，然而他们比过去的几代更有能力或更有动力去面对其负面影响。苹果最近允许第三方开发者编写软件访问iPhone的屏幕时间功能，这意味着一些新程序现在可以通过阻止应用程序来帮助用户限制屏幕时间。二十多岁的工程师T·J·德赖弗和扎克·纳斯戈维茨利用了这一变化，创造了一款名为Brick的iPhone配件，以应对他们自己的过度手机使用问题。Brick于2023年9月推出，是一个带有对应应用程序的磁化塑料立方体，允许您选择要在智能手机上屏蔽的功能。轻轻触碰这个砖块即可激活或解除屏蔽。德赖弗和纳斯戈维茨从一台3D打印机开始生产配件；现在他们有十五台机器日夜运转，每天运送数百个产品。
- en: There is no one dumbphone solution for everyone. Each digital addict is addicted
    in her own way. Stults, of Dumbwireless, uses an app called Unpluq, which works
    similarly to Brick, blocking specific apps from his smartphone while allowing
    him to maintain the store’s customer-service channels, including e-mail and Shopify.
    Krigbaum has been a committed Light Phone user for the past two years. She said
    that she doesn’t miss her smartphone, but that her new device can cause some awkwardness
    when she meets other young people who ask how to keep in touch. They mean on social
    media, of course; for the vast swath of Gen Z-ers who don’t use dumbphones, exchanging
    numbers to text message or, God forbid, call seems archaic. “I’ve been saying,
    ‘I guess I’ll see you if I see you,’ ” Krigbaum said.

  zh: 没有一种智能手机解决方案适合所有人。每个数字成瘾者都有自己的成瘾方式。Dumbwireless 的斯塔尔茨使用一款名为 Unpluq 的应用，类似于 Brick，可以阻止他的智能手机上的特定应用，同时允许他保持店铺的客户服务渠道，包括电子邮件和Shopify。克里格鲍姆在过去两年一直是忠实的
    Light Phone 用户。她说她不想念她的智能手机，但她的新设备在她遇到其他年轻人问如何保持联系时会有些尴尬。当然，他们指的是在社交媒体上；对于那些不使用智能手机的大部分
    Z 代人来说，交换电话号码进行短信或者天啊，打电话似乎已经过时了。“我一直在说，‘我猜我会见到你，如果我见到你’，” 克里格鲍姆说。
- en: 'When I want to escape from my iPhone, I pop the *SIM* card out (which, unfortunately,
    is not possible on some newer iPhones) and install it in a red Nokia 2780 flip
    phone—the closing snap of which brings me back instantly to my high-school days,
    when flip phones were cutting edge. After the surprisingly easy switching process,
    I take the simple device with me on my daily walks with my dog. If I had my smartphone
    in hand, I’d be refreshing Instagram or compulsively checking my e-mail while
    my hound does her business or sniffs tree trunks. With the Nokia, I’ve cut myself
    off from such meaningless digital stimuli but preserved my ability to answer texts
    or phone calls if necessary. (I’m too much of a millennial to actually leave the
    house without any phone.) I find myself looking more at my surroundings, which
    are particularly enjoyable in springtime, and I am more relaxed when I return
    from the excursions. When I switch the *SIM* card back into my iPhone, the device
    seems momentarily absurd: an enormous screen filled with infinite entertainment
    and information that follows me wherever I go. Then I open all my usual apps in
    quick succession—e-mail, Instagram, Slack—to see what I’ve missed. ♦'

    Instagram 或者强迫性地检查我的电子邮件。有了诺基亚，我已经割断了这种无意义的数字刺激，但保留了回复短信或电话的能力，如果必要的话。（我是个千禧一代，实在是不能没有手机就出门。）我发现自己更多地注视周围环境，春天特别令人愉悦，当我从这些探险中回来时，我也更加放松。当我把
    SIM 卡重新插回 iPhone 时，这个设备似乎是荒谬的一瞬间：一个充满无限娱乐和信息的巨大屏幕随时随地跟随着我。然后我迅速连续打开所有我常用的应用程序——电子邮件、Instagram、Slack，看看我错过了什么。♦
