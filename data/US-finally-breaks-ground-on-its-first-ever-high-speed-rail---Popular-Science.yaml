- en: Builders have officially broken ground on a new $12 billion train that could
    zoom travelers between Las Vegas and Los Angeles in just under two hours by the
    end of the decade. The new train, which is considered the first “high-speed” rail
    in the United States, could cut down commute time for travelers and reduce greenhouse
    gas emissions that would otherwise be emitted from cars and planes. Brightline,
    the firm responsible for the project, received $3 billion in support from the
    federal government as part of the 2021 bipartisan Infrastructure law.

    of the Vegas strip and another one in the LA suburb of Rancho Cucamonga. When
    it’s completed, the train will travel at 186 miles per hour, making it the fastest
    train in the US and comparable to Japan’s famous bullet trains. For context, Brightline’s
    most recently completed train connecting parts of Florida is estimated to [top
    out around 130 miles per hour](https://www.gobrightline.com/press-room/2023/brightline-130-mph-milestone).
    Both of those still fall far short of the speed achieved by the world fastest
    commuter train in Shanghai, which can [reportedly](https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/worlds-fastest-trains-cmd/index.html#)
    reach a speed of 286 miles per hour. Still, the new train could complete the 218
    mile trip between Sin City and a suburb of the City of Angels in just 2 hours
    and 10 minutes. That same trip would take about four hours by car, and that’s
    without substantial traffic.

    it to be roughly equivalent to the price of an airline flight. Brightline [reportedly](https://apnews.com/article/595913ff2fa3d9001fb89bfab4e6c4d2)

    the new train could cut back 400,000 tons of carbon dioxide per year and create
    35,000 new jobs. It could also help foster new, much-needed competition. Amtrak,
    the nation’s primary long distance rail provider, has long held a monopoly over
    long distance rail in the US, but many areas still remain unserved. Prior to this
    project, Las Vegas, for example, did not have Amtrak service. Brightline is looking
    to build out more trains in the coming decade, with a focus on connecting areas
    that commuters find too close to fly and too far to comfortably drive.
