    down the main problem with our modern diets—the factor driving ever-escalating
    rates of obesity, diabetes, heart disease and any number of other serious chronic
    conditions. The culprit isn’t saturated fats, trans fats or some new killer fat
    you haven’t of. It’s not cholesterol, carbs or sugars; dairy, gluten or meat.

    eating lots of ultra-processed food or UPF. Traditionally, people used limited
    processing techniques such as cooking and pickling to preserve food or to make
    it more pleasant to eat. Modern food companies transform food much more extensively
    through techniques such as extrusion and molding, adding lab-derived components
    including flavorings, emulsifiers and preservatives. They use this additional
    processing to make foods that are cheaper, longer-lasting and more convenient.

    van Tulleken in his recent, widely praised book, *Ultra-Processed People: The
    Science Behind Food That Isn’t Food*. These ultra-processed foods have come to
    represent a major part of people’s diets—a large majority in countries such as
    the United States, the United Kingdom and Canada. “We’ve started eating substances

- en: Another challenge is that not all ultra-processed foods are alike. In many cases,
    they are *not* more energy-dense than whole foods. Fruit yogurt is generally less
    energy-dense than a homemade cookie, for instance, largely because the yogurt
    has more water. This is part of the problem with the concept of UPF. Frozen and
    canned vegetables are often classified as ultra-processed, but they are in general
    healthier than cookies and other homemade, carb-rich foods.

    problem with processed foods, they say, is well explained by guidance that mainstream
    nutritionists have been flogging for years. “A lot of ultra-processed foods have
    high salt, fat and sugar levels,” says Kuhnle. “For most ultra-processed foods,

- en: Some recent research suggests that although there are junky, unhealthful types
    of ultra-processed food, there are other subcategories that aren’t so bad or that
    might even provide a benefit. A [prospective study of about 200,000 people](https://diabetesjournals.org/care/article/46/7/1335/148548/Ultra-Processed-Food-Consumption-and-Risk-of-Type)
    published in February 2023, found that eating more ultra-processed foods such
    as cereals, dark or whole-grain breads, yogurts and dairy desserts was associated
    with slightly lower odds of developing Type 2 diabetes.[Another prospective study
    of about 270,000 people](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanepe/article/PIIS2666-7762(23)00190-4/fulltext)
    published in November 2023 found that people who ate more ultra-processed breads
    and cereals and plant-based meat alternatives had the same or slightly lower rates
    of multimorbidity (having two or more serious health conditions) than did those
    who ate less of them.

- en: These studies are prone to the same kinds of confounders as other epidemiological
    research. It’s possible that people who have cereal for breakfast may live healthier
    lives in other, hard-to-measure ways. Still, they raise the question of whether
    ultra-processed foods comprise a monolithic category that should all be treated
    the same way, no matter what. When it comes to making real-life decisions about
    food, many nutrition experts draw lines between different types of ultra-processed
    food. “Soft drinks are banned in my house,” says Heinz Freisling, the senior author
    of the multimorbidity study. “But my daughter likes this cereal stuff. She eats
    it. I think it is possible that it can be part of a healthy diet.”

    Hall, the researcher who provided the most widely touted evidence against ultra-processed
    foods. “It’s not like cigarettes and cancer, where nobody needs to smoke, and
    you could just ban cigarettes. People need to eat food. You can’t just ban 60%
