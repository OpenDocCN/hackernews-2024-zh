    buildings. In New York, “setback” rules govern the amount of light that reaches
    a city street. This incentivizes developers to design buildings that taper as
    they grow in height — famously giving rise to the wedding-cake-style skyscraper
    and the iconic shapes of the Chrysler and Empire State Buildings. The 130-foot
    height restriction in Washington, D.C. — meant to highlight the Capitol and Washington

- en: Mumbai primarily controls building height via floor area ratios (FAR), a formula
    which pegs the total allowed floor space of a building to the size of the lot
    it’s on. An FAR limit of 1 means that a building on a lot of 4,000 square feet
    may have, at most, 4,000 square feet of internal floor space. In the absence of
    other restrictions, the builder could build a one-story building on the whole
    plot, a two-story building on half the plot, or, to take it to an extreme, a one-story
    building on half the plot with a 2,000-story extension on a single square foot
    of plot space. Unlike maximum height restrictions as in D.C., FAR allows for a
    greater variety of urban forms. But Mumbai’s FAR stands far below that of other

    these roads will have a maximum [allowable](https://www.godbolemukadam.com/pdfs/mumbai/MUBAI-DCPR.pdf)
    FAR of between 2 and 2.4. General FAR ceilings are built with innumerable loopholes

    80% of the purchase price of property up front, to be returned at the end of their
    lease. And in slums, informal rental agreements abound. But these makeshift solutions
    do not replace the formal rental system fully, as tenants lack formal protections,

    contracts of shifting legality. On some level, these workarounds are less proof

  zh: 然而，住房自由化的最大受益者可能是那些最不可见的人群 — 那些新能够进入城市的人。 [一项估计](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0304393220300428)
    发现，移居到全球南方城市的移民报告称他们的收入增加了高达 30%。与此同时，在肯尼亚进行的另一项 RCT 估计，家庭中有成员搬到内罗毕的家庭的收入增加了 [超过
    150%](https://bfi.uchicago.edu/working-paper/hidden-income-and-the-perceived-returns-to-migration-experimental-evidence-from-kenya/)。移民增加部分抵消了当前居民的好处，但只要这种增加不超过住房供应的增加，当前居民的住房条件应该会在各个收入层面上得到改善。
- en: Additionally, by allowing for a vibrant rental market, Mumbaikars would be able
    and encouraged to move and relocate such that the most expensive housing is used
    most productively. Renters would move nearer to their work, as opposed to holding
    on to their below-market-rate units at all costs. Some may even move out of the
    city if the price of rent isn’t worth the increase in earnings.

  zh: 此外，通过允许充满活力的租赁市场，孟买居民将能够并且会被鼓励移动和搬迁，使得最昂贵的住房得到最有效的利用。租户们会更接近他们的工作地点，而不是不惜一切代价保留他们的低于市场价格的单位。如果租金的价格不值得收入增加，一些人甚至可能搬离城市。
- en: Concerns around the possibility of overloading the commons are real — Mumbai’s
    roads are among the most congested in the world, and its already-stressed sewerage
    system could get even worse. Discussions around FAR also resurface fears of street-level
    overcrowding and the taxing of public infrastructure. But these don’t seem like
    insurmountable obstacles. Allowing for higher FARs in formal construction would
    increase the tax base of the city, allowing it to better deal with the challenges
    of density. And if we are to believe the benefits of agglomeration, we may expect
    increased productivity to again bolster the city’s budget.

  zh: 环境问题可能会让共享资源超载成为现实 — 孟买的道路是世界上最拥挤的之一，而其已经紧张的排水系统可能会变得更糟。关于 FAR 的讨论也再次引发对街道层面过度拥挤和公共基础设施税收的担忧。但这些问题似乎并非不可逾越的障碍。在正式建筑中允许更高的
    FAR 将增加城市的税基，使其能够更好地应对密度带来的挑战。如果我们相信集聚效应的好处，我们可以期待提高的生产力再次支持城市的预算。

- en: My acquaintances in India often discussed China in terms of a great powers competition
    between the two countries. If such a competition exists, it does so only in their
    minds. By pretty much any economic or military metric, India is far behind China.
    But perhaps the greatest illustration of where India lags is in the visual gulf
    between their great cities. In the course of two decades, Shanghai went from a
    collection of low-rise buildings and sprawling slums to a city of skyscrapers.
    No such transformation has happened in Mumbai. In fact, many smaller cities in
    China now look far taller and more economically vibrant than Mumbai.

  zh: 我在印度的熟人经常讨论中国，把两国之间看作是大国竞争。如果这样的竞争存在，那只存在于他们的脑海中。无论从经济还是军事衡量标准来看，印度远远落后于中国。但或许最明显的差距在于它们伟大城市之间的视觉鸿沟。在两十年的时间里，上海从一座低矮建筑和杂乱贫民窟的城市变成了摩天大楼林立的城市。而孟买并未发生这样的转变。事实上，中国许多较小的城市现在看起来比孟买更高、更经济活跃。
- en: The concern isn’t aesthetic or a matter of national pride. It’s difficult to
    overstate how important Mumbai is to the country’s economy. The city’s income
    tax share is twice that of the entire U.S. state of California. And much more
    than cities in the state of California, Mumbai’s growth is damaged by extreme
    restrictions on building and rentals — restrictions that only grow more binding
    every year. By limiting the effects of agglomeration, the city’s building and
    rental restrictions exert an immense drag on the city’s ability to drive growth
    on the national level. Consider that the price-to-income ratio of Mumbai’s housing
    is more than twice that of Delhi’s, almost three times that of Chennai, and almost
    five times that of Kolkata. The per-square-foot prices of housing are also roughly
    twice as much as other major cities in India. Bloomberg estimates that Mumbai
    has the third least affordable housing of large cities globally.

  zh: 这种担忧并非审美或民族自豪感的问题。很难过分强调孟买对国家经济的重要性。该市的所得税份额是美国加利福尼亚州的两倍。而且孟买的增长受到极限建设和租赁限制的损害，这些限制每年只会变得更加紧缩。通过限制聚集效应的影响，该市的建设和租赁限制对其推动国家级增长的能力造成了巨大阻碍。考虑到孟买住房的价格收入比是德里的两倍多，是金奈的近三倍，是加尔各答的近五倍。每平方英尺的住房价格也大约是印度其他主要城市的两倍。彭博社估计，孟买是全球大城市中住房最难负担的第三名。
- en: Mumbai’s policies are not particularly unique. Many cities and states in India
    have rent control policies and stringent restrictions on construction (albeit
    less so than Mumbai). Instead, Mumbai is the city in which the costs of these
    restrictions are greatest and most visible, given its high population, economic
    importance, and unfortunate geography. And if we do not fix Mumbai’s anti-building
    policies and demonstrate the practicality of doing so now, we may soon find many
    of India’s large cities in similarly dire straits.

  zh: 孟买的政策并不特别独特。印度许多城市和邦都有租金控制政策和对建设的严格限制（尽管不及孟买严格）。相反，孟买是这些限制成本最高且最明显的城市，这是由于其高人口、经济重要性和不利的地理位置。如果我们现在不修复孟买的反建筑政策，并展示这样做的实用性，我们可能很快会发现印度许多大城市也陷入类似困境。

- en: We can imagine a variety of policies that may simultaneously allow the city
    to liberalize, protect tenants from large price shocks, and avoid overcrowding
    of public amenities. For example, we’ve seen how extra FAR is provided along wider
    roads and in exchange for additional parking. Robustly increasing the size of
    these incentives could encourage both development and decongestion at once. Alternatively,
    first increasing FARs in Mumbai’s wealthiest or least densely populated areas
    could help redistribute population and allow for an initial test case of the proposal.

  zh: 我们可以想象各种政策，这些政策可以同时允许城市自由化，保护租户免受大幅价格冲击，并避免公共设施的过度拥挤。例如，我们已经看到在更宽的道路沿线和额外停车位的交换中提供额外的建筑密度。大力增加这些激励措施的规模可以同时促进发展和减少拥堵。或者，首先在孟买最富裕或人口密度最低的地区增加建筑密度，可以帮助重新分配人口，并为提案进行初步测试。

    relevant only to the elite: parking versus parks, limits on profits for builders,
    or bizarre claims that easing building restrictions will lead to higher prices.

  zh: 但就目前而言，关于城市未来的有意义的辩论却在只关乎精英阶层的争执中岌岌可危：停车还是公园，对建筑商利润的限制，或者荒谬的声称放宽建筑限制将导致房价上涨。然而，在现状下，这座城市缺乏住房、公园和停车位。
- en: The situation is untenable. Even crude solutions — the wholesale end of rent
    control in two years time, or the blanket tripling of FAR across Mumbai — may
    be an improvement over the current state. This is not to say that we shouldn’t
    strive for a more nuanced set of policy prescriptions, but that given the current
    state of the city’s housing market, we cannot let disagreements over the minutiae
    of policy become excuses to do nothing.

  zh: 目前的情况难以为继。即使是粗糙的解决方案——在两年内彻底结束租金管制，或者全面提高孟买的建筑容积率三倍——可能比当前的状态有所改善。这并不意味着我们不应该努力寻求更为细致的政策建议，而是考虑到城市住房市场的现状，我们不能让对政策细节的分歧成为不作为的借口。
