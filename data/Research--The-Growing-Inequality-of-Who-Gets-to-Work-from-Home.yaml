    Research on job postings found that remote work is far more common for higher
    paid roles, for roles that require more experience, for full-time work, and for
    roles that require more education. Managers should be aware of this divide, as
    it has the potential to create toxic dynamics within teams and to sap morale.  <content

    work has exploded since the pandemic struck, and employees like it. In speaking
    to hundreds of managers about this development, one concern crops up again and
    again: The shift to remote work is highly unequal. Front-line staff with modest
    paychecks rarely enjoy the benefits of working from home. Instead, they commute
    every workday to engage customers and coworkers, operate machinery, and look after
    facilities. In contrast, highly paid professionals and managers often work from
    home two or three days a week — saving time, money, and aggravation. Business
    leaders rightly worry that this divide could hurt morale among front-line staff,
    undermine perceived fairness, and create new rifts in the workforce.</content>'

  zh: 远程办公的分歧越来越大。对招聘岗位的研究发现，远程工作在更高薪酬的职位、需要更多经验的职位、全职工作以及需要更多教育的职位中更为普遍。管理者应该意识到这种分歧，因为它有可能在团队内部产生毒性动态并消耗士气。

    —— 节省时间、金钱和烦恼。企业领导正确地担心这种分歧可能会影响一线员工的士气，破坏被认为是公平的，以及在劳动力中创建新的裂痕。</content>
