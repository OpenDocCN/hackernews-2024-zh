- en: As California prepares to implement a new law that requires major fast food
    chains to pay workers a minimum of $20 an hour starting in April, a new report
    explains why the governor's relationship with a billionaire helped exempt Panera
    Bread and chain restaurants like it and now some lawmakers are calling for an
    investigation into the deal. In 2022, state lawmakers passed the F.A.S.T Recovery
    Act, which set new wages and established a council to bargain working conditions
    and pay on behalf of the half a million fast food workers in the state. Baked
    into the legislation was a carve-out for chains that bake and sell their own bread.
    Bloomberg reported that the exemption is the result of the governor's relationship
    with billionaire and Panera franchisee Greg Flynn, who was initially a major opponent
    of the bill. Multiple sources told KCRA 3 that the governor pushed for the exemption
    in the late stages of the bill's negotiation in 2022 with Flynn's influence. “This
    legislation was the result of countless hours of negotiations with dozens of stakeholders
    over two years," said Newsom's office spokesman Alex Stack in a statement on Wednesday.
    "Staff in the Governor’s Office met with dozens of business owners as well as
    union representatives, as is expected when policies of this consequence are moving
    through the Legislature.”According to state campaign finance data, Flynn donated
    $100,000 to Newsom's campaign against the 2021 recall and $64,800 to his reelection
    campaign in 2022\. He told Bloomberg he did not play a role in crafting the exemption.
    He did not respond to KCRA 3's request for comment Wednesday night. The California
    Assembly's Republican Minority Leader James Gallagher called for an investigation
    Wednesday night. "Can any franchisee get an exemption from the $20 minimum wage
    law or do they need to donate more than $150k to Newsom first? This crooked deal
    needs to be investigated," Gallagher said. KCRA 3 reached out to the offices of
    Speaker of the Assembly Robert Rivas and Senate Pro Tem Mike McGuire for comment
    on Wednesday night. Neither responded. "Our margins, our profits have gone down
    from 9% to 3.5%," Flynn told KCRA 3 in an interview in 2022\. "We’re barely hanging
    on. And when I think about the creation of a state council that is designed specifically
    to add more costs, I don’t know if we can make it.”The law faced the threat of
    a referendum later that year, and after a year's worth of negotiations, the fast-food
    industry, labor groups and lawmakers agreed to move forward with the legislation,
    and the exemption remained. When Newsom finally signed the agreement into law
    in 2023 at a news conference in Los Angeles, KCRA 3 asked why the exemption was
    there in the first place and why Panera and other bakery counter service restaurant
    workers won't have the same protections. "That's a part of the sausage making,"
    Newsom replied. "We went back and forth, and that was part of the negotiation,
    that's the nature of negotiation. It's not just Jack in the Box, it's not just
    McDonald's, there are a lot of different players, and this affects a lot of different
    franchises and different models as it relates to that and different conditions
    and environments. That was all part of the give and take and that was the collective
    wisdom of the Legislature and ultimately led to my signature."

  zh: 加利福尼亚州准备实施一项新法律，从四月开始要求主要快餐连锁店支付工人每小时至少**$20**的最低工资，一份新报告解释了为什么州长与亿万富翁的关系帮助豁免了泛美乐面包店和类似的连锁餐厅，现在一些立法者要求对这笔交易进行调查。2022年，州议员通过了F.A.S.T复苏法案，设定了新的工资标准，并建立了一个委员会代表州内五十万快餐工人谈判工作条件和工资。立法中固定了为那些自己烘焙和销售面包的连锁店保留的内容。彭博社报道称，这一豁免是由于州长与亿万富翁兼泛美乐特许经营者格雷格·弗林的关系，他最初是该法案的主要反对者之一。多个消息源告诉KCRA
    3，州长在2022年的法案谈判后期推动了这一豁免，受到了弗林的影响。Newsom办公室发言人亚历克斯·斯塔克在周三的一份声明中说：“这项立法是在两年时间里与数十名利益相关者进行了无数小时的谈判的结果，包括与立法机构一同推进这类重大政策时所预期的数十名企业主和工会代表的会面。”根据州竞选财务数据，弗林在2021年的罢免投票中捐赠了$100,000给Newsom的竞选活动，并在2022年的连任竞选中捐赠了$64,800。他告诉彭博社他没有参与制定豁免。他没有回应KCRA
    3周三晚上的评论请求。加利福尼亚州众议院共和党少数党领袖詹姆斯·加拉格尔周三晚上呼吁展开调查。“任何特许经营者都可以获得$20最低工资法的豁免吗？还是他们需要先向Newsom捐款超过$150,000？这笔欺诈交易需要调查。”
    KCRA 3周三晚上联系了众议院议长罗伯特·里瓦斯和参议院议长迈克·麦奎尔的办公室，但两人均未回复。弗林在2022年接受KCRA 3采访时说：“我们的利润率已从9%下降到3.5%。我们勉强维持生计。当我考虑到一个旨在增加成本的州议会的设立时，我不知道我们能不能继续下去。”该法律面临着同年晚些时候的公投威胁，经过一年的谈判后，快餐行业、工会团体和立法者达成了继续推动这项立法的协议，而豁免条款依然保留。当Newsom最终在2023年在洛杉矶举行的新闻发布会上签署协议时，KCRA
    3询问为什么豁免条款一开始就存在，以及为什么泛美乐和其他面包柜台服务餐厅的工人不会享有相同的保护时，他回答说：“那是协商的一部分。”、“我们反复讨论，这是协商的本质。不只是‘杰克的盒子’，不只是‘麦当劳’，还有很多不同的参与者，这会影响很多不同的特许经营店和不同的模式以及不同的条件和环境。这都是立法机构的集体智慧，最终导致了我的签名。”
