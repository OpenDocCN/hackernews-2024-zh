    by an elderly attorney I worked with for the first fifteen years of my practice
    and I always nodded in his general direction when he said that and smiled as if
    agreeing. I liked and respected him, he had won more cases than there were months
    in my life at the time and he had lived in a legal and business world in which
    the entire community knew one another and knew who to trust.

- en: It was not. Oswald had a good point and I knew plenty of very good attorneys
    and business people who hated arbitration, figuring that arbitrators, largely
    unafraid of the appellate courts, could be tyrants and dangerous and who wanted
    unlimited discovery so they would not be surprised by evidence at the arbitration.

  zh: 不是这样的。奥斯瓦尔德说得有道理，我知道很多非常优秀的律师和商业人士都讨厌仲裁，认为仲裁员大多不畏上诉法院，可能成为暴君，危险至极，他们想要无限的发现，这样他们在仲裁时不会被证据惊讶到。
- en: But one could always put discovery into the arbitration clause if that was important
    and most arbitrators, including myself, were pretty good at following the law.
    Arbitration is not perfect. Neither are the courts. But we could afford arbitration
    and it was a real question if we could afford a real fight against such a well
    funded opponent if push came to shove. A contract without power to enforce it…is
    not worth the paper it is written on. I smiled as I thought that and the VC wondered
    what was going through my head.

- en: What was going through my head was the real test I was planning to use now.
    And this test was the important one, the “acid test” and I went to it immediately. 
    “Well, if we cannot use relatively inexpensive methods of enforcement, we can
    still avoid some of the problem by simply providing that the winning party in
    any dispute gets attorney fees from the losing party. Simple as that. It stops
    fights before they begin since both sides only go to court if they are convinced
    they will win.  No insincere fights since if you lose you pay for your opponent’s
    attorney fees as well.”

  zh: 我脑海中想的是我现在计划使用的真正测试。这个测试非常重要，是“酸性测试”，我立即进行了。“如果我们不能使用相对廉价的执行方法，我们仍然可以通过规定任何争议的胜方从败方获得律师费来避免一些问题。就这么简单。这样可以在争论开始之前就阻止战斗，因为双方只有在他们确信自己会赢的情况下才会上法庭。没有虚伪的争斗，因为如果你输了，你也要支付你对手的律师费。”
- en: And was the great equalizer as well.  To win a fight and get a million dollars
    but spend two million to get it means you lost even if you won. A big budget opponent
    knows that and can destroy your case by simply forcing you to spend money. But
    if the winning side can get attorney fees from the other side…well, the cost benefit
    ratio then allows even the party with less money to take on a giant…if they are
    convinced they will win.

- en: He tapped his fingers, face blank. I went on. “That’s the law in Germany and
    in quite a few European nations, you know. That’s one reason they have so little
    litigation. No nuisance suits. Here, as I am sure you know, in most cases you
    don’t get awarded attorneys fees if you win unless  you put it in the contract.
    We almost always do that in our contracts.”

    has not been our experience at all. Indeed, not. Indeed, attorney’s fees being
    awarded to the winning party encourages litigation in our experience.”

    What would be the rationale for people starting nuisance actions if they knew
    they would not only pay their attorney but yours as well? One would expect that

    a lot of money and our client did not, an attorneys fees clause such as we proposed
    would allow us to fight him if he started a suit just to force us to capitulate
    because the fees were so high. Any party really intending to work in good faith
    should have no hesitation in such an obviously useful clause-a clause that truly
    makes the wronged party whole if there is litigation.

  zh: 又是一阵沉默。事实上，我们俩都知道真正的问题在哪里。如果他有很多钱而我们的客户没有，像我们提议的律师费条款将允许我们在他提起诉讼只是为了迫使我们屈服时与他作斗争，因为费用太高。任何真正打算诚意合作的一方在这样一个显然有用的条款上都不应该犹豫——这样的条款真正能让受伤的一方在诉讼中得到全面的补偿。
