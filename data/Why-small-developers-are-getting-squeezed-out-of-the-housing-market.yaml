    project, but obtaining it is not a straightforward process. That’s because construction,
    in addition to being expensive, is very risky. There are a hundred things that
    can go wrong. A dozen usually do, and that’s only if you're lucky. That’s a problem
    for more reasons than one. Traditional banks, the primary lenders in the construction
    markets, aren't in the risk business. They're in the risk management business.

- en: This mitigation materializes in a few ways. First are the key ratios and metrics
    used to assess a project's viability. Arguably the most important metric is the
    Debt Service Coverage Ratio, which calculates how much net operating income (NOI)
    a property generates compared to the amount of stabilized debt it has. Ideally
    this exceeds 1.2 (where a property has 20% more NOI than debt). The Debt Yield
    is another important metric. It looks at NOI as a percentage of the total stabilized
    loan amount. Typically, lenders want this number to be more than 10%, or for a
    property with a $1,000,000 loan to have at least $100,000 of NOI.

  zh: 这种缓解措施通过几种方式实现。首先是用于评估项目可行性的关键比率和指标。可以说最重要的指标是债务服务覆盖比率，它计算一个物业生成的净营业收入（NOI）与其稳定债务金额的比率。理想情况下，这个比率应超过1.2（即物业的NOI比债务多20%）。债务收益率是另一个重要的指标。它以NOI占稳定贷款金额的百分比计算。通常，贷款人希望这个数字超过10%，或者对于一笔$1,000,000贷款的物业来说，至少有$100,000的NOI。
- en: Second, lenders are cautious about the size of the loans they offer as they
    want to avoid being overexposed to projects that might go south. Banks in the
    US today rarely extend credit instruments with a Loan-to-Cost (LTC) ratio greater
    than 75%. Depending on the macroeconomic situation, the size of the development,
    and the quality of the borrower, some developers may struggle to finance more
    than 50% of their hard and soft costs from one lender. This prompts them to either
    put up a larger amount of equity (reducing their returns) or seek alternative
    bridge financing to reach 65-70% LTC, albeit with higher interest rates.
  id: totrans-split-25
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 其次，贷款人对提供的贷款规模持谨慎态度，因为他们希望避免过度暴露于可能失败的项目。今天，美国的银行很少会发放贷款成本比（LTC）大于75%的信贷工具。根据宏观经济形势、开发规模和借款人的质量，一些开发者可能会难以从一个贷款人那里融资超过50%的硬成本和软成本。这促使他们要么投入更多的股本（降低他们的回报），要么寻求替代性桥梁融资，以达到65-70%的LTC，尽管利率较高。
- en: Lastly, lenders will take collateral. If a borrower fails to live up to the
    terms of the contract, the bank can seize the asset. Though not a simple process,
    it’s rather straightforward. Through foreclosure, the lender will try to recover
    the balance of the debt they issued, sometimes making a small profit, sometimes
    losing a little bit.

  zh: 最后，贷款人将采取抵押品。如果借款人未能履行合同条款，银行可以没收资产。虽然这不是一个简单的过程，但相当直接。通过执行抵押品，贷款人将尝试收回他们发放的债务余额，有时能够小赚一笔，有时会有少许损失。
- en: This process is trickier in construction. The last thing a bank wants to do
    is take over a project midway through. They're not developers, after all. **Collateral
    of a bad asset isn’t worth very much. And half-finished buildings are pretty bad
    assets**. Half-finished structures, initially designed by a team no longer involved
    in the project, may have limited market appeal, especially if the plans were unconventional.
    This team may have cut corners as well, but that’s difficult to know unless a
    comprehensive diagnostic is carried out, which is expensive and time consuming.
    One hopes nothing will be found, but chances are that if a project went bust halfway
    through, things were not on the up and up. In the case where changing market conditions
    made the continuance of the project infeasible, whether due to rising costs or
    diminished demand for the final project, there may be no buyers for a stalled
    out construction site.

  zh: 这个过程在建筑领域更为棘手。银行最不愿意做的事情就是在项目进行到一半时接管。毕竟，他们不是开发商。**不良资产的抵押品价值并不高。而且半建成的建筑物是相当糟糕的资产**。半建成的结构，最初由已不再参与项目的团队设计，可能市场吸引力有限，尤其是如果计划是非常非传统的。这个团队可能也会走捷径，但除非进行全面的诊断，否则很难了解情况，而这是昂贵且耗时的。希望不会发现任何问题，但如果项目中途倒闭，情况可能并不乐观。如果市场条件的变化使得项目的继续进行不可行，无论是因为成本上升还是最终项目需求减少，可能就没有买家愿意购买停滞不前的建筑工地了。
- en: This is bad news for the bank. Taking over a project means they likely won't
    receive all of their principal back, and they certainly won’t be getting any interest
    payments, which is their core business model. If a bank issues a $6 million loan
    on a deal, and the sponsor walks away from it, the bank faces two choices. The
    first is to wait for someone to acquire the project for its debt basis, which
    could take a while. The second, less favorable option, would be to market the
    project for its land basis as some other form of development. This would be a
    matter of last resort, as the land may only be worth $1 million on a project of
    this scale. Given the headaches associated with demolishing whatever was built,
    it might trade for even less than this. Staring down a $5 million loss, lenders
    may opt to sit on the asset until the market turns around. You can imagine how
    precarious these things get when a couple of zeros are factored in. But the hope
    of salvation tomorrow is far more enticing than dealing with the reality of today.

  zh: 这对银行来说是个坏消息。接管一个项目意味着他们可能无法收回所有本金，而且肯定不会得到任何利息支付，这是他们的核心业务模式。如果一家银行在一笔交易中发放了600万美元的贷款，而赞助商放弃了这笔交易，银行面临两个选择。第一是等待有人以其债务基础收购该项目，这可能需要一段时间。第二个不太有利的选择将是将该项目营销为其土地基础上的其他形式的开发。这将是最后的手段，因为在这样规模的项目中，土地可能只值100万美元。考虑到拆除已建成部分可能带来的麻烦，它的交易价格可能甚至不到这个金额。面对500万美元的损失，放贷人可能选择坐等市场好转。你可以想象，当几个零被考虑进去时，这些事情变得多么不稳定。但是，对明天的救赎的希望比面对今天的现实更具诱惑力。
- en: This brings us to the crux of the issue. *Not everyone can execute a real estate
    development project.* It’s risky, difficult, and requires a highly specialized
    skill set. Banks don’t fully know who will be able to execute at the onset of
    a project. The best they can do is to work with developers who have a long established
    track record. Even this is no guarantee of success. But it erects a fairly sizable
    barrier to entry for smaller, younger, or unproven outfits who don’t have any
    track record to speak of, to say nothing of a proven one. A catch-22 materializes.
    The only way to get financing from a bank is to have done projects before, but
    the only way to have done projects before is to have gotten support from a bank

    their ability to perform this mitigation. While there may be smaller customers
    who grow to become larger clients one day, many won’t make it there, and banks
    don’t exactly want to bet on the few who will survive. This isn’t to say traditional
    lenders aren’t willing to extend some level of risk, but it falls short of solving
    the challenge at a meaningful scale. As has been explored, the risk and effort
    associated with small loans are simply not worth it for the banks. While a lender
    might be comfortable underwriting a duplex, introduce complexities like a ground
    floor commercial unit with an ADU in the back of the lot, and it might be a better
    use of everyone’s time to burn the mortgage contract before it’s even signed.

    building, the absence of a secondary market for these sorts of non-conforming
    loans is a significant structural obstacle. The majority of mortgages are sold
    on the secondary market, which allows banks to export their risk to someone else.
    That risk can only be exported, however, if there’s Federal support. *But Fannie
    Mae and Freddie Mac don’t provide the backstopping lenders require to get comfortable
    with issuing these sorts of products,* meaning traditional lenders must hold these
