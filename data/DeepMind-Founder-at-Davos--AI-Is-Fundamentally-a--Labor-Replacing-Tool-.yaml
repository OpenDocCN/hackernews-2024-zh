    The [“AI revolution”](https://www.ft.com/content/f84bd56f-484d-4393-bafc-4428da6a7873)

    [“人工智能革命”](https://www.ft.com/content/f84bd56f-484d-4393-bafc-4428da6a7873) 主要是企业界的一场革命，一场反对普通员工的起义，利用新技术来减少公司的整体人数。

    Mustafa Suleyman, sat down for [an interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Go_6UldZL50)
    with CNBC. Suleyman was in Davos, Switzerland, for the World Economic Forum’s
    [annual get-together](https://gizmodo.com/sam-altman-openai-davos-wef-ai-needs-to-go-nuclear-1851173201),

    the most popular topic of conversation. During his interview, Suleyman was asked
    by news anchor Rebecca Quirk whether AI was “going to replace humans in the workplace
    in massive amounts.”

    苏莱曼在瑞士达沃斯参加世界经济论坛的[年度聚会](https://gizmodo.com/sam-altman-openai-davos-wef-ai-needs-to-go-nuclear-1851173201)，人工智能据说是最热门的话题。
    在接受采访时，苏莱曼被新闻主播丽贝卡·奎克（Rebecca Quirk）问到，人工智能是否“将大规模取代人类在工作场所的工作。”

    but it’s obvious that said “labor replacement” is already happening. The tech
    and media industries—which [are uniquely exposed](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/10/27/ai-exposure-is-new-buzz-term-for-softening-talk-about-job-losses.html)
    to the threat of AI-related job losses—saw huge layoffs last year, right as AI
    was “coming online.” In only the first few weeks of January, well-established
    companies like Google, Amazon, YouTube, Salesforce, and others have announced
    more aggressive layoffs that have been [explicitly linked](https://www.axios.com/2024/01/18/tech-layoffs-ai-2024-google-amazon)

  zh: 索雷曼让这听起来像是一种模糊的未来假设，但显然所谓的“劳动力替代”已经在发生。科技和媒体行业——[受到AI相关工作丧失威胁的行业](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/10/27/ai-exposure-is-new-buzz-term-for-softening-talk-about-job-losses.html)——去年出现了大规模裁员，就在AI“上线”的同时。在仅仅几周的一月份，像谷歌、亚马逊、YouTube、Salesforce等知名公司宣布了更加激进的裁员计划，这些裁员计划[明确与更多的AI部署相关](https://www.axios.com/2024/01/18/tech-layoffs-ai-2024-google-amazon)。
- en: The [general consensus](https://www.axios.com/2024/01/18/tech-layoffs-ai-2024-google-amazon)
    in corporate America seems to be that companies should use AI to operate leaner
    teams, the likes of which can be bolstered by small groups of AI-savvy professionals.
    These AI professionals will become an increasingly sought after class of worker,
    as they’ll offer the opportunity to reorganize corporate structures around automation,
    thus making them more “efficient.”

  zh: 在美国企业界的[普遍共识](https://www.axios.com/2024/01/18/tech-layoffs-ai-2024-google-amazon)似乎是，公司应该利用AI来运营更精简的团队，这些团队可以由少数懂得AI的专业人士加强。这些AI专业人士将成为越来越受欢迎的工人阶层，因为他们将提供重新组织公司结构以实现自动化的机会，从而使其更加“高效”。
- en: For companies, the benefits of this are obvious. You don’t have to pay a software
    program, nor do you have to supply it with health benefits. It won’t get pregnant
    and have to take six months off to care for its newborn child, nor will it ever
    become disgruntled with its working conditions and try to start a union drive

- en: The billionaires who are marketing this technology have made vague rhetorical
    gestures to things like universal basic income as a cure for the inevitable worker
    displacements that are going to happen, but only a fool would think those are
    anything other than empty promises designed to stave off some sort of underclass
    uprising. The truth is that AI is a technology that was made by and for the managers
    of the world. The frenzy in Davos this week—where the world’s wealthiest fawned
    over it like Greek peasants discovering Promethean fire—is only the latest reminder
    of that.

- en: 'The short answer to that question is: Not a very good one. This week, it was
    revealed that the influential AI organization [was working with the Pentagon](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-01-16/openai-working-with-us-military-on-cybersecurity-tools-for-veterans?embedded-checkout=true&sref=P6Q0mxvj)
    to develop new cybersecurity tools. OpenAI had previously promised not to join
    the defense industry. Now, after a quick edit to its terms of service, the company
    is charging full-steam ahead with the development of new toys for the world’s
    most powerful military. After getting confronted about this pretty drastic pivot,
    the company’s response was basically: **¯\_(ツ)_/¯** ...“Because we previously
    had what was essentially a blanket prohibition on military, many people thought
    that would prohibit many of these use cases, which people think are very much
    aligned with what we want to see in the world,” a company spokesperson told Bloomberg.
    I’m not sure what the hell that means but it doesn’t sound particularly convincing.
    Of course, OpenAI is not alone. Many companies are currently rushing to market
    their AI services to the defense community. It only makes sense that a technology
    that [has been referred](https://www.wsj.com/articles/bill-gates-says-artificial-intelligence-is-the-most-revolutionary-technology-in-decades-75fb8562)
    to as the “most revolutionary technology” seen in decades would inevitably get
    sucked up into America’s military industrial complex. Given what other countries
    [are already doing](https://www.npr.org/2023/12/14/1218643254/israel-is-using-an-ai-system-to-find-targets-in-gaza-experts-say-its-just-the-st)

    …“因为我们先前对军事领域有一种类似于全面禁止的约束，许多人认为这将禁止许多人认为与我们希望看到的世界非常一致的用例，”一位公司发言人告诉彭博社。我不确定这是什么意思，但听起来并不特别令人信服。当然，OpenAI并不孤单。许多公司目前正在抢先向国防社区推广其AI服务。一个在数十年来[被称为](https://www.wsj.com/articles/bill-gates-says-artificial-intelligence-is-the-most-revolutionary-technology-in-decades-75fb8562)“最具革命性技术”的技术不可避免地会被吸纳到美国的军事工业体系中。鉴于其他国家已经[在利用AI](https://www.npr.org/2023/12/14/1218643254/israel-is-using-an-ai-system-to-find-targets-in-gaza-experts-say-its-just-the-st)做些什么，我想这只是个开始。
