- en: In 2013—after enduring multiple professional setbacks, one denied grant after
    another, and a demotion at the institution to which she’d been devoted for decades—Katalin
    Karikó, Ph.D., walked out of her lab at the University of Pennsylvania’s School
    of Medicine for the last time.

  zh: 2013年，在经历了多次职业挫折，一次又一次的被拒资助，以及在她献身多年的机构里被降职后，卡塔琳·卡里科博士最后一次走出了宾夕法尼亚大学医学院的实验室。
- en: 'For decades the Hungarian biochemist had been fixated on the possibilities
    of [mRNA](https://www.glamour.com/story/covid-19-vaccine-not-linked-to-infertility),
    the genetic messenger that delivers DNA instructions to the protein-making infrastructure
    in each of our cells. Karikó—with her collaborator, immunologist Drew Weissman,
    M.D., Ph.D.—believed in its potential to treat stubborn and fatal conditions like
    strokes and even cancer, hoping that mRNA could be used to program cells to produce
    their own cures. The two were evangelizers, but their work attracted few converts.
    Those who knew about it tended to be dismissive: fanciful, nice concept, dead
    end.'

  zh: 数十年来，这位匈牙利生物化学家一直着迷于[mRNA](https://www.glamour.com/story/covid-19-vaccine-not-linked-to-infertility)，这种基因信使将DNA指令传递到我们每个细胞中的蛋白质制造基础设施。卡里科与她的合作者、免疫学家德鲁·魏斯曼博士，Ph.D.，相信它有治疗顽固和致命疾病（如中风甚至癌症）的潜力，希望mRNA可以用于编程细胞产生自己的治愈方法。这两人是宣扬者，但他们的工作吸引了很少的转变者。了解此事的人往往持否定态度：幻想、好的概念，却是死路一条。
- en: 'That morning at the lab, Karikó’s old boss had come to see her off. She did
    not tell him what a terrible mistake he was making in letting her leave. She didn’t
    gloat about her future at BioNTech, a pharmaceuticals firm that millions now associate
    with lifesaving vaccines but was then a relative upstart in the field. Instead
    the woman who had bounced from department to department, with no tenure prospects
    and never earning over $60,000 a year, said with total confidence: “In the future,
    this lab will be a museum. Don’t touch it.”'

  zh: 今天早上在实验室，卡里科的老板来送她。她没有告诉他让她离开是多么大的错误。她也没有吹嘘她在BioNTech的未来，这家如今被数百万人认为是救命疫苗的制药公司，但当时在该领域还只是一个新秀。这位曾经在各个部门之间跳跃，没有终身职位前景，从未年薪超过6万美元的女士，满怀信心地说道：“将来，这个实验室将成为博物馆。别碰它。”
- en: Back in 2013 pandemics were the subjects of big-budget blockbusters like *Contagion*
    and books about the great influenza of 1918\. Few people expected to experience
    one, and even fewer knew the name of the scientist whose marginalized research
    would go on to serve as the foundation for some of the most effective vaccines
    ever made.

  zh: 回到2013年，大流行病是大制作电影如《全境封锁》和关于1918年大流感的书籍的主题。几乎没有人预料到会经历一次，更没有人知道那位边缘化研究的科学家的名字，而这项研究最终成为一些最有效疫苗的基础。
- en: Karikó has never craved fame, nor did she spend decades toiling at the bench
    for prizes (although she and Weissman have received the Lasker Award, the Horwitz
    Prize, the Dr. Paul Janssen Award for Biomedical Research, and the Breakthrough
    Prize in Life Sciences in just the past few months). But fine, she has started
    to take a little pleasure in certain aspects of worldwide renown. First there’s
    the dream turned real—for her, scientific progress is measured in actual impact.
    With millions inoculated and the path out of the pandemic charted on the foundation
    of her research, she has lived to see the purpose in her work. And second, there’s
    the small, modest delight she takes in the fact that a few weeks before our interview,
    she ran into the man who’d led her out of her beloved lab at Penn eight years
    earlier. He told her he was preparing to give a lecture about her.

  zh: 卡里科从未渴望过名声，也没有为了奖项而在实验室辛苦工作（尽管她和魏斯曼最近几个月内先后获得了拉斯克奖、霍维茨奖、保罗·詹森生物医学研究奖和生命科学突破奖）。但是，她开始稍微享受全球知名度的某些方面。首先，梦想成真——对她来说，科学进步是以实际影响来衡量的。随着数百万人接种疫苗，她的研究奠定了疫情结束的基础，她见证了她工作的意义。其次，还有她在我们采访前几周碰到的人的小小、谦逊的愉悦——他是8年前将她从心爱的宾夕法尼亚大学医学院实验室领出去的人，他告诉她他正准备为她做一场演讲。
