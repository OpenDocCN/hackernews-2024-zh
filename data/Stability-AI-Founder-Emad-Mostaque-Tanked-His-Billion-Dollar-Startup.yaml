    been running out of money for months and Mostaque had been unable to secure enough
    additional funding. It had defaulted on payments to Amazon whose cloud service
    undergirded Stability’s core offerings. The star research team behind its flagship
    text-to-image generator Stable Diffusion had tendered their resignations just
    three days before — [as *Forbes* would first report](https://www.forbes.com/sites/iainmartin/2024/03/20/key-stable-diffusion-researchers-leave-stability-ai-as-company-flounders/

    未能获得足够的额外资金。公司拖欠给亚马逊的付款，而后者的云服务是 Stability 核心产品的基础。其旗舰文本生成器 Stable Diffusion 背后的星级研究团队在三天前辞职，正如《福布斯》首次报道的那样，其他高级领导人给了他一个最后通牒：辞职，否则我们也走。
- en: Still, onstage before a massive audience of peers and acolytes, Mostaque talked
    a big game. “AI is jet planes for the mind,” he opined. “AI is our collective
    intelligence. It's the human Colossus.” He claimed a new, faster version of the
    Stable Diffusion image generator released earlier this month could generate “200
    cats with hats per second.” But later, when he was asked about Stability’s financial
    model, Mostaque fumbled. “I can’t say that publicly,” he replied. “But it’s going
    well. We’re ahead of forecast.”

    Stable Diffusion 图像生成器的新版本能够每秒生成“200只戴帽子的猫”。但是后来，当他被问及 Stability 的财务模型时，Mostaque
    支吾其词。“我不能公开说那个，”他回答道。“但目前情况良好。我们领先于预期。”

    abdicated his role to decentralize “the concentration of power in AI.” But sources
    told *Forbes* that was hardly the case. Behind the scenes, Mostaque had fought
    to maintain his position and control despite mounting pressure externally and
    internally to step down. Company documents and interviews with 32 current and
    former employees, investors, collaborators and industry observers suggest his
    abrupt exit was the result of poor business judgment and wild overspending that

    Mostaque, who said on X that he still owns a majority of the company, also stepped
    down from the board, which has now initiated a search for a permanent CEO. There
    is a lot of work to be done to turn things around, and very little time in which
    to do it. Said the current Stability executive, “There’s still a possibility of

  zh: Stability 没有回答关于是否打算继续这种策略的问题，现在 Mostaque 已经不在岗位上。不管怎样，临时联合首席执行官 Wong 和 Laforte
    正在紧张的时间表上清理他留下的烂摊子。董事会主席 Jim O’Shaughnessy 在一份声明中表示，他对这对人“能够熟练地引领公司在开发和商业化行业领先的生成式人工智能产品方面前进”充满信心。但是公司的烧钱速度继续远远超过收入。*Financial

    星期五称，该公司二月份收入为 540 万美元，支出为 800 万美元。几位消息人士称，目前仍然担心是否能够支付大约 150 名剩余员工的工资。在混乱中，领导职位已经空缺数月，使得公司越来越无方向性。

    a potentially catastrophic legal threat looms over the company: A trio of copyright
    infringement lawsuits brought by Getty Images and a group of artists in the U.S.
    and U.K., who claim Stability illegally used their art and photography to train
    the AI models powering Stable Diffusion. A London-based court has already rejected
    the company’s bid to throw out one of the lawsuits on the basis that none of its
    researchers were based in the U.K. And Stability’s claim that Getty’s Delaware
    lawsuit should be blocked because it''s a U.K.-based company was rejected. (Stability
    did not respond to questions about the litigation.)'

  zh: 与此同时，公司面临潜在的灾难性法律威胁：由 Getty Images 和美国及英国一群艺术家提起的三起侵犯版权诉讼，他们声称 Stability 非法使用其艺术作品和摄影作品来训练驱动
    Stable Diffusion 的 AI 模型。伦敦的一家法院已经拒绝了该公司试图以其研究人员均不在英国为由驳回其中一起诉讼的申请。而 Stability
    声称 Getty 的特拉华州诉讼应该被阻止，因为它是一家总部在英国的公司，这一说法也被驳回。（Stability 没有回答关于诉讼的问题。）
- en: AI-related copyright litigation “could go on for years,” according to Eric Goldman,
    a law professor at Santa Clara University. He told *Forbes* that though plaintiffs
    suing AI firms face an uphill battle overcoming the existing legal precedent on
    copyright infringement, the quantity of arguments available to make are virtually
    inexhaustible. “Like in military theory, if there’s a gap in your lines, that’s
    where the enemy pours through — if any one of those arguments succeeds, it could
    completely change the generative AI environment,” he said. “In some sense, generative
    AI as an industry has to win everything.”

  zh: 根据圣克拉拉大学的法律教授埃里克·戈德曼的说法，与AI相关的版权诉讼“可能持续数年”。他告诉 *福布斯*，尽管起诉AI公司的原告在克服现有的版权侵权法律先例方面面临艰难的斗争，但可以进行的论点数量几乎是无穷无尽的。“就像军事理论中所说的，如果你的阵线有空隙，敌人就会从那里冲过来——如果其中任何一个论点成功，它可能会彻底改变生成AI环境，”他说。“在某种意义上，生成AI作为一个产业必须赢得一切。”
- en: Stability, which had more than $100 million in the bank just a year and a half
    ago, is in a deep hole. Not only does it need more funding, it needs a viable
    business model — or a buyer with the vision and chops to make it successful in
    a fast-moving and highly competitive sector.

    hands meeting this past Monday, Stability’s new leaders detailed a path forward.
    One point of emphasis: a plan to better manage resources and expenses, according
    to one person in attendance. It’s a start, but Mostaque’s meddling has left them
    with little runway to execute. His resignation, though, has given some employees
    hope. “A few people are 100% going to reconsider leaving after today,” said one
    current employee. “And the weird gloomy aura of hearing Emad talking nonsense
    for an hour is gone.”'
