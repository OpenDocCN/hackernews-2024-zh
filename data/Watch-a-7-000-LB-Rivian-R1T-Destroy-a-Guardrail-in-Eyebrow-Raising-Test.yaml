- en: In the 1990s, the Midwest Roadside Safety Facility looked into the then-50-year-old
    highway guardrail system and found it to be incapable of handling the increasing
    number of SUVs and pickups at the time. Guardrails were then redesigned to handle
    the larger, heavier vehicles that were becoming more and more popular. But that
    was 30 years ago, long before the recent onslaught of shockingly heavy electric
    vehicles. What happens when a 7,100-pound [Rivian](https://www.thedrive.com/category/rivian-news)
    R1T hits a 30-year-old guardrail design? It tears through it like tissue paper,
    which you can see in this new video from the Midwest Roadside Safety Facility
    at the University of Nebraska.

  zh: 在1990年代，中西部公路边安全设施审查了当时50年历史的公路护栏系统，并发现它无法处理当时越来越多的SUV和皮卡。当时的护栏被重新设计，以处理越来越受欢迎的更大更重的车辆。但那是30年前，远在最近极重的电动车大量出现之前。当一辆重达7,100磅的[Rivian](https://www.thedrive.com/category/rivian-news)
    R1T撞向一个30年历史的护栏设计时会发生什么？它会像纸巾一样撕裂它，你可以在内布拉斯加大学中西部公路边安全设施的这段新视频中看到。
- en: According to the *[Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/electric-vehicles-crash-test-guardrails-nebraska-3ec299a7ad87d0f63a6dd9357f663fce)*,
    both the University of Nebraska and Army Corps of Engineers collaborated to crash
    a [Rivian R1T](https://www.thedrive.com/new-cars/2022-rivian-r1t-electric-pickup-review-features-price-competitors-info)
    into a guardrail at 60 mph for research purposes. The 7,100-pound truck obliterates
    the guardrail and vaults over the concrete median that followed. Although the
    test initially appears to show an head-on impact, which could be considered unlikely
    and unrealistic, footage later in the video clarifies that the pickup meets the
    guardrail at an oblique angle. The barrier used in the test was 31 inches high,
    made from 12-gauge corrugated steel, mounted on six-inch-deep steel posts.

    R1T](https://www.thedrive.com/new-cars/2022-rivian-r1t-electric-pickup-review-features-price-competitors-info)，这辆重达7,100磅的卡车击毁了护栏，并越过随后的混凝土中央隔离带。尽管测试最初显示了正面撞击，这可能被认为是不太可能和不现实的，但视频后来澄清了拾货车与护栏在斜角上碰撞。测试中使用的障碍物高31英寸，由12号波纹钢制成，安装在六英寸深的钢柱上。
- en: It isn't only Rivians, either. "The system was not made to handle vehicles greater
    than 5,000 pounds," Cory Stolle, from the university’s Midwest Roadside Safety
    Facility, told the *AP*. Many EVs exceed that 5,000-pound weight limit, or are
    much heavier. The Army Corps of Engineers also crash-tested a Tesla into the guardrail
    and, rather than going through it, it went underneath and continued.

- en: Many electric vehicle manufacturers tout the increased safety of EVs, thanks
    to their unique packaging without engines and transmissions getting in the way.
    However, that safety is *internal*. Researchers noted that the passenger compartment
    of the R1T in question was fine after the test, and its occupants would likely
    have walked away from the crash without serious injury. However, those passengers
    wouldn't be as lucky if their electric pickup ripped through a guardrail at the
    edge of a cliff, and it goes without saying that anyone in another, lighter vehicle
    colliding with the Rivian would be at serious risk, too.

  zh: 许多电动汽车制造商都吹捧电动汽车的安全性得到了增加，这要归功于它们独特的结构，没有发动机和变速器的存在。然而，这种安全性是*内部*的。研究人员注意到，被测试的R1T的乘客舱在测试后没有问题，乘客在撞车时可能会幸免于严重受伤。然而，如果他们的电动皮卡将护栏撕裂后悬挂在悬崖边，那些乘客就不会那么幸运了，而且可以毫不犹豫地说，如果另一辆更轻的车撞到Rivian车上，那些乘客也会面临严重的风险。

- en: It's worth noting that EVs aren't the only vehicles that crest the 5,000-pound
    mark. Any full-sized, heavy-duty pickup on the market will easily surpass 6,000
    pounds, with some like the Ford F-350 and Silverado HD 2500 even exceeding 7,000
    pounds. Even the [Chevy Suburban](https://www.thedrive.com/new-cars/2022-chevy-suburban-review-a-simple-beast-with-a-simple-mission),
    a fairly common vehicle for families, can tip the scales at over 6,000 pounds
    depending on its powertrain. But EVs are universally heavier than gas cars of
    equal dimensions thanks to their batteries, and many of them are already beyond
    the limit.

- en: Thankfully, guardrails changed before to adapt to rising vehicle weights, and
    they can change again. While Stolle isn't certain what types of materials or construction
    will be needed, suggesting the potential need for more concrete barriers, this
    is a problem the country has solved before. "We need to know as much as we can
    now because it takes time to design new systems, evaluate them, and confirm those
    results with full-scale crash testing," Stolle told *[Nebraska Today](https://news.unl.edu/newsrooms/today/article/nebraska-experts-weigh-highway-safety-and-electric-vehicles/)*.
