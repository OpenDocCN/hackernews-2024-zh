- en: Out-of-control behavior by CEOs and other powerful people constantly makes headlines
    – so much so that some might consider impulsivity a pathway to power. New research
    from the UC San Diego Rady School of Management and Texas A&M University finds
    that having self-control is often what leads to power.

  zh: 高管和其他有权势的人的失控行为经常成为头条新闻，以至于一些人可能认为冲动性是通向权力的途径。加州大学圣地亚哥分校拉迪管理学院和德克萨斯农工大学的新研究发现，自控力通常是导致权力的关键。
- en: In a paper published in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, researchers
    find that showing self-control influences how powerful an individual is perceived
    to be by their peers, as well as how much power they are granted by those peers.
    In a series of seven experiments with roughly 3,500 participants, both students
    and working adults read about or interacted with individuals with varying levels
    of self-control, which the researchers define as how much people tend to behave
    in ways aligned with their goals. Across all experiments, individuals with high
    self-control were seen as more powerful, and as better suited for powerful roles,
    than individuals with low self-control.

  zh: 在发表于《人格与社会心理学杂志》的一篇论文中，研究人员发现展示自控力如何影响同事对个体的权力认知，以及他们被同事授予的权力程度。在大约3500名参与者中进行了七项实验，学生和工作成年人阅读或与具有不同自控力水平的个体互动，研究人员定义自控力为人们倾向于行为与其目标一致的程度。在所有实验中，自控力强的个体被视为更具权力，更适合担任权力角色，而自控力低的个体则相反。
- en: In one experiment, working adults imagined a scenario where a colleague with
    the goal of being fit either ate a large dessert or abstained from dessert altogether.
    Researchers found that the colleague was seen as being better suited for high-power
    roles when they abstained from indulging, an indication of self-control.

  zh: 在一项实验中，工作中的成年人设想了一个场景，即一个希望保持健康的同事选择是吃大份甜点还是完全戒掉甜点。研究人员发现，当同事选择戒掉享受甜点时，被视为更适合高权力角色，这显示了自控力。
- en: “It did not matter whether the colleague seemed to deliberate before acting,
    or just acted without thinking,“ said Pamela Smith, associateprofessor of management
    at the Rady School of Management and co-author of the study. “What mattered for
    participants’ judgments was whether the colleague acted in line with their goals.
    This pattern held across a variety of goals in our experiments, including saving
    money, being healthy and reading books.”

- en: The researchers also found that people are perceived as less powerful and less
    suited for powerful roles when they fail to meet ambitious goals, even if their
    performance is the same as their peers. In an experiment investigating how self-control
    often leads to power, a group of undergraduate students interacted with individuals
    who set various reading goals. Some set an ambitious goal of reading 200 pages
    each week, while others set a more moderate goal of reading 50 pages per week.
    All of these individuals read the same amount – 100 pages – but those who didn’t
    meet their goal were seen as less powerful by study participants. Furthermore,
    study participants were less interested in having those who didn’t meet their
    goal as the group leader in later tasks.

  zh: 研究人员还发现，即使其表现与同行相同，未能实现雄心勃勃的目标的人被认为更无权和不适合担任权力角色。在一项研究自控力通常导致权力的实验中，一群本科生与设定各种阅读目标的个体互动。一些人设定了每周阅读200页的雄心勃勃目标，而其他人则设定了每周阅读50页的较为温和目标。所有这些人都阅读了相同数量的100页，但那些未能达到他们目标的人被研究参与者视为更无权。此外，研究参与者对于那些未能达成目标者在后续任务中担任团队领导不感兴趣。
- en: “To motivate their employees, organizations often want employees to set stretch
    goals – goals that are challenging and hard-to-reach. However, we found that setting
    a stretch goal and not meeting it makes someone look less powerful than setting
    an easy goal and surpassing it,” said Rady School PhD student Shuang Wu, the first
    author of the paper.
