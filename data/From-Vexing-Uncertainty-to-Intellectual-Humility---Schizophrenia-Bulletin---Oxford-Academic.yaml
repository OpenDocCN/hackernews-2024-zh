    1992, as a graduate student at Cambridge University, a porter found me amongst
    the cows in the meadows of King’s College, after being there for 2 or 3 days.
    I was in bad physical shape, having eaten nothing, and apparently getting water
    from the river. He asked what I was doing. I replied: “I’m solving a problem about
    stochastic calculus.” This statement was true, but did not answer his question.
    He took me to the hospital, where I remained for some weeks.'

    time that anybody noticed, the first time that I was unable to hide it from others,
    and therefore from myself. What follows is an abbreviated account of how I learned—haltingly,
    with setbacks, over the years—to cope with chronic schizophrenia. There have been
    near-collapses, but I have managed to keep a job for 30 years. I have not, until
    recently, been open about my diagnosis (excepting my wife and a close friend).

    me, and I them, not least through what some philosophers call “hermeneutical justice.”
    Without these people, there would be no “coping,” and the rest of what follows
    could never have happened. I will focus on just two of the symptoms that I experience,
    symptoms that have not been dislodged by medication (although medication can be
    helpful in other ways): auditory hallucination, and two recurring delusion-like

  zh: 我故事中最重要的部分是人。之所以我没有入狱、无家可归或死亡，是因为有几个真正尊重和关心我的人，我也尊重和关心他们，这不乏一些哲学家所说的“诠释正义”。没有这些人，就不会有“应对”，接下来的一切也不可能发生。我将重点介绍我经历过的两个症状，这些症状没有被药物消除（尽管药物在其他方面可能有所帮助）：听觉幻听和两种反复出现的类幻觉经历。
- en: I have hallucinated music since childhood. Voices came later, and visual hallucinations
    later still. Often the voices are distant, a conversation that does not involve
    me, and I can ignore it. Sometimes the voices are closer, and sometimes they speak
    to me. These voices are commonly of people I know, but sometimes they are strangers.
    Sometimes they are critical. Sometimes they comment on what is happening. Sometimes
    they blather. Occasionally they are encouraging.

  zh: 我从小就开始幻听。声音稍后出现，视觉幻觉更晚一些。通常声音是遥远的，一个不涉及我的对话，我可以忽略它。有时声音更近，有时它们对我说话。这些声音通常是我认识的人的声音，但有时它们是陌生人。有时它们是批评性的。有时它们评论正在发生的事情。有时它们胡言乱语。偶尔它们是鼓励性的。
- en: Musical hallucinations do not distress me. Voices are a different story—they
    are rarely intrinsically disturbing, but uncertainty about their origin is. For
    some time, it felt important to figure out whether the voices were coming from
    people who are physically present. My doctor called it “reality-check.” Sometimes
    reality check is easy, eg, if there is a voice whispering in my ear but nobody
    near my ear. But often reality check is very difficult. In a crowded place, hearing
    a conversation, does one ask people whether they just said anything? Does one
    snoop around to find the source of the talking? Does one stare at people’s mouths
    to see whether they are talking?

  zh: 音乐幻听并不让我感到不安。声音则是另一回事——它们很少从本质上让人感到不安，但是对它们来源的不确定性却很困扰。有一段时间，我觉得很重要弄清楚声音是否来自身边的人。我的医生称之为“现实检查”。有时，现实检查很容易，例如，如果有声音在我耳边低语但周围没有人。但通常情况下，现实检查是非常困难的。在拥挤的地方听到一段对话，我该问人们是否刚才说了什么吗？我该四处张望找到谈话的来源吗？我该盯着人们的嘴看他们是否在说话吗？
- en: 'The doctor was half-right: I felt better when I was sure about the origin of
    voices, and anxious when not (especially when they were directed at me). But sometimes
    it is awkward, difficult, or practically impossible, to gain that assurance. My
    frequent inability or unwillingness to do a reality check caused anxiety, which
    makes symptoms worse, and things can spiral out of control. Once I figured these
    things out, I typically avoided situations where it would be a problem. There
    are a lot of those situations, so this solution is not great.'

  zh: 医生说对了一半：当我确定声音的来源时，我感觉更好，而当不能确定时感到焦虑（尤其是当声音是针对我的时候）。但有时候，获得那种保证是尴尬的、困难的，或者几乎是不可能的。我经常无法或不愿进行现实检查，这引起了焦虑，使症状加重，事情可能失控。一旦我弄清了这些事情，我通常会避免可能出现问题的情况。这些情况有很多，所以这个解决方案并不太好。
- en: Some years ago, a funny situation changed my approach to hallucinations. The
    scene is a cold, dark, morning, in a coffee shop. There are no other customers.
    I order my coffee and pastry, sit down, and start working. Soon I hear a conversation.
    Normally I would have done my reality check, and doing so would have been easy
    (it’s a small shop), but I felt confident that nobody apart from the sole employee
    and myself were present, and the voices were not inherently disturbing, so I kept
    working. Then one of the voices said my name, directly to me. Hearing my name
    almost always gets my attention, and I turned around, although still expecting
    to see nothing, but there were two people behind me—real people!—and I knew one
    of them; he had recognized me and was saying hello.

  zh: 几年前，一个有趣的情况改变了我的幻听方式。场景是一个寒冷、黑暗的早晨，在一个咖啡店。没有其他顾客。我点了咖啡和糕点，坐下来开始工作。很快我听到了一段对话。通常我会进行现实检查，而这样做也很容易（这是一家小店），但我确信除了唯一的员工和我之外没有其他人在场，而且声音本身并不让人不安，所以我继续工作。然后，其中一个声音直接叫了我的名字。听到我的名字几乎总是能吸引我的注意，我转过身去，尽管仍然期望看到什么也没有，但我后面有两个人——真实的人！——我认识其中一个；他认出了我，并向我打招呼。
- en: 'I suppose that sort of thing had happened before, but in that moment I realized
    something that I had not realized before: It is not important to *know* where
    the voices are coming from. It had just been demonstrated to me that prior to
    turning around I did *not* know their origin, and yet I was comfortable having
    taken on the “mere belief,” and as it turned out the *false* belief, that nobody
    was there. I realized in that moment that the comfort that came from successful
    reality-checks came not from knowledge or certainty, but from a *clear belief*
    about the voices. In this situation, that belief, even though it turned out to
    be false, was enough. And after I was forced to change my belief, it was still
    fine. I was able to turn back around and continue working, now believing that
    the voices were coming from people behind me. “And what if,” I thought, “those
    people quietly left, but I kept hearing the conversation, believing it to come
    from them?” Well, I’d probably eventually discover that they weren’t there, that
    the conversation was no longer real, and that would be fine too.'

  zh: 尽管这些事件看起来微不足道，但它们改变了我的人生。其他症状也出现了类似的模式。以下是两个例子。
- en: The first is close to “thought-broadcasting,” and for some time I did worry
    that others might hear my thoughts. I tried hard to think nice thoughts, or to
    think nothing. After extensive self-reflection, I realized that something slightly
    different is going on. I realized that it is difficult to tell the difference
    between speaking out loud and thinking. When I’m focused, I can tell the difference
    by paying careful attention to my body—especially my lips and throat—but one cannot
    always focus in that manner, and the resulting uncertainty about what has, or
    has not, been said out loud can kindle anxiety. Many of my conversations are laced
    with uncertainty about what I have said out loud, versus merely thought to myself.

  zh: 第一个例子接近于“思想广播”，有一段时间我担心其他人可能听到我的想法。我努力去想好事，或者什么都不去想。经过深入反省，我意识到正在发生的事情略有不同。我意识到很难区分出声音是大声说出来的还是在想。当我集中精力时，我可以通过仔细关注我的身体——尤其是我的嘴唇和喉咙——来区分出声音的差异，但人并不总是能以那种方式集中精力，而对于自己是否已经大声说出或仅仅是在想的不确定性会引发焦虑。我的许多对话都充满了我是否已经大声说出了什么，而不仅仅是自己心里想的不确定性。
- en: After I realized what is going on, I tried to avoid this uncertainty, either
    by trying not to think or say anything (which is difficult), or by frequently
    repeating myself (which is obnoxious). More recently, I’ve accepted that it rarely
    matters whether others have heard me. If I happen to mention (or merely to think?)
    that I’m allergic to eggplant, it matters very little whether you heard. So these
    days, most of the time, I just make my own determination about whether the other
    person heard, just as one might do after making an off-hand remark on the periphery
    of a conversation, and that determination is good enough. I don’t double-check,
    repeat myself, or ask whether you heard, unless it really matters. This habit
    produces some false positives and some false negatives. It turns out that most
    of the time, it just doesn’t matter.

  zh: 我意识到发生了什么后，我试图避免这种不确定性，要么尽量不去思考或说任何事情（这很困难），要么经常重复自己（这很讨厌）。最近，我接受了一个事实：别人是否听到我说的话很少重要。如果我碰巧提到（或者仅仅是想到？）我对茄子过敏，你是否听到几乎无关紧要。所以这些天，大多数时候，我只是自己确定对方是否听到，就像在对话的边缘随口说一句话后可能会做的那样，而且这种确定是足够的。我不会再核实，重复自己，或者问你是否听到，除非真的很重要。这个习惯会产生一些假阳性和假阴性。事实证明，大多数时候，这并不重要。
- en: The second example concerns mirrors. It often seems to me that there are cameras,
    or persons, behind mirrors. I used to check mirrors (and still do sometimes),
    but I have come to realize and to accept that most of the time, it doesn’t matter.
    If there are voyeurs on the other side, that’s their wretched problem, not mine.
    For me, the path of least resistance is to allow that there probably is something
    on the other side. As long as I’m clear with myself, all is well.

- en: There is a common theme to these strategies. It’s definite belief, not certainty,
    that allows me to get along. It’s not that certainty, or something like it, *never*
    matters. If you are fixing dinner for me I’ll try to be clear about the eggplant
    allergy, and I might repeat myself. And as I do when I teach students, I’ll monitor
    you for a sign that you have heard and understood, and I might even ask you to
    confirm it. I might, in other words, be a little obnoxious about it, and I hope
    that you’ll be patient with me. But most of the time, just having a definite,
    if unconfirmed and possibly false, belief about the situation is fine. It allows
    one to get along.

  zh: 这些策略有一个共同的主题。这是确定的信念，而不是确定性，使我能够相处。并不是说确定性或类似确定性的东西*从不*重要。如果你给我做晚餐，我会试图清楚地说明茄子过敏问题，并且我可能会重复自己。当我教学生时，我会监视你是否有收到和理解的迹象，甚至可能会要求你确认。换句话说，我可能会对此有点刻板，我希望你能对我耐心些。但大多数时候，只是对情况有一个确定的，尽管未经确认且可能错误的信念就足够了。这让人可以相处。
- en: I think of this attitude as a kind of “intellectual humility” because although
    I *do care* about truth—and as a consequence of caring about truth, I do form
    beliefs about what is true—I no longer agonize about whether my judgments are
    wrong. For me, living relatively free from debilitating anxiety is incompatible
    with relentless pursuit of truth. Instead, I need clear beliefs and a willingness
    to change them when circumstances and evidence demand, without worrying about,
    or getting upset about, being wrong. This attitude has made life better and has
    made the “near-collapses” much rarer.

  zh: 我认为这种态度是一种“知识谦逊”，因为虽然我*确实关心*真理——并且由于关心真理，我会形成关于什么是真实的信念——但我不再苦恼于我的判断是否错误。对我而言，相对地摆脱了令人严重焦虑的生活与对真理的不懈追求不相容。相反，我需要清晰的信念，以及在情况和证据要求时改变它们的意愿，而不必担心或因为错误而心烦意乱。这种态度让生活变得更好，也让“几乎崩溃”的情况变得更少。
