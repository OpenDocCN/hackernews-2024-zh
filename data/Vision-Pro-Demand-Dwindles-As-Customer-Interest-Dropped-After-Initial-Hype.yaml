- en: Apple's Vision Pro headset took the AR market by storm with its stunning looks
    and advanced technology underneath. While the headset had a solid start, the traction
    has reduced over time, potentially due to its hefty price tag and minimal real-world
    use cases. Prominent industry analyst claims that the demand for Vision Pro demos
    has greatly reduced, highlighting poor demand for the headset after initial hype.

  zh: Apple的Vision Pro头戴式显示器以其令人惊叹的外观和先进的技术在增强现实市场上掀起了风暴。然而，随着时间的推移，该头戴式显示器的吸引力有所减弱，可能是因为其昂贵的价格标签和实际应用案例的极少。知名行业分析师声称，对Vision
    Pro演示的需求大大减少，突显了在初期炒作之后，该头戴式显示器的需求疲软。

  zh: Apple将Vision Pro市场定位为空间计算机，虽然它具备了相应的属性和应用程序，但昂贵的价格标签并非适合所有人。*[Mark Gurman](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-04-21/apple-aapl-growth-opportunities-southeast-asia-and-africa-lower-end-iphone-lv9itkna)*来自彭博社指出，自其推出以来，Vision
    Pro的热情已经减退，并且对演示和产品本身的需求显著减少。分析师表示：
- en: Demand for demos is way down. People who do book appointments often don't show
    up, and sales — at least at some locations — have gone from a couple of units
    a day to just a handful in a whole week. Apple also has had to step up the marketing
    on its online homepage. There's a huge promo for the Vision Pro at the top of
    the website.

  zh: 对演示的需求急剧下降。那些预约了的人经常不出现，而销售——至少在某些地点——已经从每天几台机器减少到整整一周只有几台。苹果还不得不加大在其在线主页上的营销力度。网站顶部有关于Vision
    Pro的大促销。
- en: Apple has to step up its game and offer a budget variant of the headset to increase
    adoption, as the VR category is not permeable for easier inception. Gurman also
    shared his experience with the Vision Pro and how he barely uses the device for
    work and even media consumption. He also states that the tedious work involved
    in attaching batteries, booting the device, and navigating the interface makes
    it an inconvenience compared to other devices like a laptop or a tablet.

  zh: 苹果必须加快步伐，推出头戴式显示器的预算版本以增加采纳率，因为VR类别对于更容易的初始使用并不渗透。古曼还分享了他对Vision Pro的体验，以及他几乎不用这款设备进行工作甚至媒体消费的经历。他还指出，与笔记本电脑或平板电脑等其他设备相比，连接电池、启动设备和导航界面等繁琐的工作使其比较不便利。
- en: Additionally, visionOS is still in its early stages, and third-party developers
    are yet to offer their apps for the platform, which is one of the reasons why
    the analyst sticks to his laptop, even for content consumption. Apple has yet
    to optimize its apps for the Vision Pro as well, and since it is a first-gen product,
    it might take some time for developers to curate bugs and issues for a seamless
    user experience.

  zh: 此外，visionOS仍处于早期阶段，第三方开发者尚未为该平台提供其应用程序，这也是分析师坚持使用笔记本电脑的原因之一，即使是用于内容消费。苹果也尚未为Vision
    Pro优化其应用程序，由于这是第一代产品，开发者可能需要一些时间来解决问题，以实现无缝的用户体验。
- en: The company is working on the second generation of the Vision Pro, which could
    offer overall improvements along with a price reduction, allowing the headset
    to become a [mainstream product](https://wccftech.com/vision-pro-2-success-depends-on-these-factors/).
    So far, Apple is planning to manufacture 400,000 units of the device this year
    due to production issues. The Vision Pro will be available in additional countries
    later this year, which could increase sales figures.

    Pro 将在今年晚些时候在更多国家上市，这可能会提高销售额。
