- en: Many names did get changed as immigrants settled into their new American lives,
    but those changes were made several years after arrival and were done by choice
    of someone in the family. The belief persists, however, that the changes were
    done at the entry point and that the immigrants were unwilling participants in
    the modifications. Sophisticated family history researchers have long rolled their
    collective eyes at the “Ellis Island name change” idea. In genealogy blogs and
    online publications, they wearily repeat the correction—names were not changed
    at Ellis Island; immigrants changed their own names, usually during the citizenship
    process. But the belief persists, perhaps because people need to explain surname
    changes in a way that satisfies them (thinking that their immigrant ancestors
    made the changes themselves apparently does not do so).

  zh: 许多人的名字确实在移民定居到他们的新美国生活中时发生了变化，但这些变化是在到达几年后由家庭中的某人自愿做出的选择。然而，人们仍然坚信，这些变化是在入境点进行的，并且移民是不情愿参与这些修改的。然而，老练的家族史研究者们长期以来对“埃利斯岛改名”这一想法不胜其烦。在家族史博客和在线出版物中，他们厌倦地重复着这一纠正——在埃利斯岛没有人的名字被改变；移民自己改变了他们的名字，通常是在入籍过程中。但这种信念仍然存在，也许是因为人们需要以一种能够满足他们的方式来解释姓氏变化（显然，认为他们的移民祖先自己做出了这些变化并不能满足他们）。

- en: It’s vital to remember that the people coming over from Europe and other places
    were paying passengers, not cattle. They weren’t shoved onto ships and then dumped
    onto American shores to be newly cataloged by harried immigration officials. The
    shipping companies were running a business, much as airlines do today—they sold
    tickets to people who could afford to purchase them (even a steerage class ticket
    cost almost a thousand dollars in today’s currency)….Agents quoted ticket prices
    to the would-be traveler, accepted payment, and then recorded each traveler’s
    name and other identifying information (the specific information collected varied
    over the years). The information taken down by the agents was sent to the home
    office, where it was transferred by shipping company clerks onto large blank sheets
    provided by the US government. Those sheets became the passenger lists which later
    were used by American port officials.

  zh: 重要的是要记住，从欧洲和其他地方来的人是付费乘客，而不是牲畜。他们并没有被推上船，然后被倾倒在美国海岸上，由匆忙的移民官员重新登记。航运公司在经营一项业务，就像今天的航空公司一样——他们向能够购买票的人出售票（即使是二等舱的票价在今天的货币中也接近一千美元）...。代理商向即将出行的旅客报价，接受支付，然后记录每位旅客的姓名和其他身份信息（多年来收集的具体信息有所不同）。代理商记录的信息被发送到总部，在那里由航运公司的职员将其转录到由美国政府提供的大型空白表上。这些表格成为后来由美国港口官员使用的乘客名单。

    was complete, it was turned over to the ship’s captain. On departure day, crew
    members checked people’s names against the list as they came on board. The crew
    allowed past them only those people whose names were on the list, i.e., those
    who had paid for a ticket….Captains were required by the 1819 Steerage Act to
    sign a statement printed on the manifest verifying that the names on each list
    matched the names of those people disembarking. Any discrepancies resulted in
    fines for the shipping company. Thus it was in the shipping company’s interest
    to make sure no one stepped onto American soil whose name was not already on a
    manifest.

  zh: 当特定航程的所有票已售完并且清单完成后，清单交给了船长。在出发当天，船员在乘客登船时逐一核对其姓名。只有在名单上的人，即已经购票的人，才能通过他们。...根据1819年的“驾驶舱法案”，船长必须签署打印在清单上的声明，以验证名单上的姓名与即将下船的人的姓名是否相符。任何差异都会导致对航运公司的罚款。因此，航运公司有兴趣确保没有人进入美国土地，其姓名不在清单上。

    and delivered it to the chief immigration official. That official checked it and
    then gave the manifest to officers called registry clerks who questioned each
    traveler and verified the information recorded on the lists…Obviously then, despite
    what the *Godfather* film conveys, the officials at Ellis Island did not record
    travelers’ names—they had pages with the names *already filled in*. The task of
    the registry clerks was to do the same thing the ship’s crew had done: check each
    person’s stated name against the name recorded on the manifest.'

    an immigrant’s name because it was too difficult to spell or sounded too foreign.
    On a side note, the belief that immigration officials changed names to make them
    less “foreign” presumes that the Ellis Island officials were of different ethnicities
    than the immigrants and were openly hostile to them. In fact, officials were often
    hired *because* they spoke multiple languages.

- en: From an [excellent debunking](https://journals.ala.org/index.php/dttp/article/view/6655/8939)
    by Rosemary Meszaros and Katherine Pennavaria. Many people will continue to deny
    the obvious but if you still have doubts you can find the original manifests through
    the [National Archives](https://www.archives.gov/). The urban legend that names
    were changed at Ellis Island comes from a scene in the Godfather movie and perhaps
    because people with Americanized names today like to think that someone other
    than their ancestor changed their name.
