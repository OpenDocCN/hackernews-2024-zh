    to circumnavigate some data centers. The ones I chose sit between a regional airport
    and some farm fields in Goodyear, Arizona, half an hour’s drive west of downtown
    Phoenix. When my Uber pulled up beside the unmarked buildings, the temperature
    was 97 degrees Fahrenheit. The air crackled with a latent energy, and some kind
    of pulsating sound was emanating from the electric wires above my head, or maybe
    from the buildings themselves. With no shelter from the blinding sunlight, I began

    with vents and pipes visible along their sides. A third building is under construction,
    and seven more are on the way. Each will be decked out with rows of servers and
    computers that must be kept below a certain temperature. The complex has been

    a data center not unlike the ones right next to me. A facility like this would
    have to connect the ping from my cellphone to Uber’s driver network in order to
    find me a ride home.

- en: Exactly how much power does this Goodyear data center use, and how much of it
    is renewable? Neither Microsoft nor the local utility company would say. As for
    water use, a records request to the city returned documents with all of the numbers
    redacted; a representative for the city said the numbers were “considered proprietary
    by Microsoft.” But a report that Microsoft filed with the city council provides
    at least an estimate. An analysis commissioned by the company anticipates that
    when construction for the third building is complete, the complex will use about
    56 million gallons of drinking water each year, equivalent to the amount used
    by 670 Goodyear families.

    desert is not about to make anyone go thirsty. Barbara Chappell, Goodyear’s water-services
    director, told me the city’s relationship with Microsoft on the whole hasn’t given
    her cause for concern. But the supply of water in the region *is* quite limited,
    and the more that’s taken up by data centers, the less there is for, say, supplying
    tap water to new housing. “We’re going to have to make tough choices in the near
    future to make sure our state is protected for future generations,” Arizona Attorney
    General Kris Mayes told me. “Allowing one more data center to come to our state
    is an easy but stupid decision in a lot of cases. It’s like the cotton candy of

    to promote its own, very different narrative at the world’s most important climate
    event of the year. In the run-up to the United Nations’ Conference of Parties,
    held this past fall in Dubai, Big Tech firms were proudly claiming that AI is
    not so much a source of new emissions as it is a way to [lower them](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/03/climate/artificial-intelligence-climate-change.html),
    by making batteries and buildings more efficient, for example, and reducing food
    waste. (This is mainly true of predictive-AI models, Sasha Luccioni, a researcher
    and climate lead at the AI firm Hugging Face, told me. The generative ones have
    yet to demonstrate significant environmental benefits that would justify their
    mounting footprint.) At the same time, Microsoft [announced a new partnership](https://news.microsoft.com/2023/11/29/unfccc-partners-with-microsoft-to-use-ai-and-advanced-data-technology-to-track-global-carbon-emissions-and-assess-progress-under-the-paris-agreement/)
