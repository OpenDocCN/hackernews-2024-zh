  zh: 澳大利亚悉尼的Star赌场发生软件故障，导致其无意中在数周内赠送了数百万现金。
- en: News of the giveaway emerged on Monday at an independent inquiry into the casino,
    which has had years of compliance troubles that led to a finding that its operators
    were unsuitable to hold a license.

  zh: 这一赠送消息是在独立调查赌场的周一披露的，该赌场多年来一直存在合规问题，导致其经营者被认定不适合持有执照。
- en: The cash was doled out by "ticket in, cash out" (TICO) machines that gamblers
    use to redeem barcoded receipts for slot machine winnings.

  zh: 这些现金是通过“票据兑现”（TICO）机器发放的，赌徒用它们来兑换赌机中奖的条形码收据。

    [PDF] given on Monday to the inquiry, casino manager Nicholas Weeks explained
    that it is possible to insert two receipts into TICO machines. That was a feature,
    not a bug, and allowed gamblers to redeem two receipts and be paid the aggregate
    amount.

  zh: 在周一向调查作证的Nicholas Weeks赌场经理解释说，TICO机器可以插入两张收据。这不是故障，而是一个功能，允许赌徒兑现两张收据并获得总额支付。
- en: But a software glitch meant that the machines would return one of those tickets
    and allow it to be re-used – the barcode it bore was not recognized as having
    been paid.

  zh: 但是由于软件故障，机器会退回其中一张收据并允许其重新使用 - 它的条形码未被识别为已支付。

    customers in circumstances when they shouldn''t have received it because of that
    defect," Weeks told the inquiry.'

  zh: “发生的情况是由于该缺陷，客户在不应该接收的情况下会额外得到少量现金，” Weeks在调查中解释道。
- en: Readers may wish to take issue with Weeks's use of the word "small" – TICO machines
    can pay out up to AU$2,000 ($1,290) each time a customer redeems receipts.

  zh: 读者可能会对Weeks使用“少量”一词感到不满 - TICO机器每次赎回收据最多可支付2000澳元（1290美元）。

    that news of the free cash got around and 43 people used the TICO machines to
    withdraw money to which they were not entitled – at least one of them a recovering
    gambling addict who fell off the wagon as the "free" money allowed them to fund
    their activities.

  zh: 当地媒体[报道](https://www.smh.com.au/national/nsw/casino-gave-gamblers-free-cash-then-reported-them-for-fraud-20240417-p5fkg2.html)，有关免费现金的消息传开，43人使用了TICO机器提取他们没有资格得到的钱款，其中至少有一位康复中的赌徒因为“免费”资金的支持而重蹈覆辙。
- en: Known abusers of the TICO machines have been charged, and one of those set to
    face the courts is accused of association with a criminal group. (The first inquiry
    into The Star, two years ago, found it may have been targeted by organized crime
    groups.)

  zh: TICO机器的已知滥用者已被起诉，其中一人被指控与犯罪团伙有关。两年前对The Star的首次调查发现，可能遭到了有组织犯罪团伙的针对。

  zh: 尽管审计人员在2023年6月7日至7月24日之间发现TICO机器存在差异，但软件故障直到一个月后才被发现。

  zh: 一项内部调查发现，“多次（人为、过程和技术上的）失误极有可能导致未能及早识别这一欺诈行为”。
- en: Weeks attributed those failures to "cultural problem in parts of the casino
    in relation to the level of rigor through which controls are followed, the level
    of care in which work is conducted, and the desire from people in the business
    to drill down on things in circumstances where they don't appear that they are
    correct."

  zh: Weeks将这些失败归因于“在赌场部分地区存在的文化问题，与控制执行的严格程度、工作执行的仔细程度以及业务人员在看似不正确的情况下深入钻研事物的愿望”。
- en: The fresh inquiry into Star Casino was called after its response to earlier
    probes was felt to have fallen short. Testimony this week has also revealed that
    the casino's analysts don't get enough info to do their jobs well, and that facial
    recognition systems don't include images of some who should have completed source
    of wealth checks designed to detect possible money laundering. Those who did not
    complete their checks could therefore still enter the casino and gamble large
    sums of money. ®

  zh: 对Star Casino的新调查是在此前调查的响应被认为不足之后启动的。本周的证词还透露，赌场的分析师获取的信息不足以很好地完成工作，而面部识别系统并未包含应该完成资金来源检查的一些人的图像，该检查旨在检测可能的洗钱行为。因此，那些未完成检查的人仍可进入赌场并赌注大笔资金。
