- en: Recent years have seen successive waves of book bans in Republican-controlled
    states, aimed at pulling any text with “woke” themes from classrooms and library
    shelves. Though the results sometimes seem farcical, as with the banning of Art
    Spiegelman’s *Maus* due to its [inclusion of “cuss words”](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2022/02/the-inside-story-of-the-banning-of-maus-its-dumber-than-you-think/)
    and explicit rodent nudity, the book-banning agenda is no laughing matter. Motivated
    by bigotry, it has already done demonstrable harm and promises to do more. But
    at the same time, the appropriate response is, in principle, simple. Named individuals
    have advanced explicit policies with clear goals and outcomes, and we can replace
    those individuals with people who want to reverse those policies. That is already
    beginning to happen in many places, and I hope those successes will continue until
    every banned book is restored.

- en: If and when that happens, however, we will not be able to declare victory quite
    yet. Defeating the open conspiracy to deprive students of physical access to books
    will do little to counteract the more diffuse confluence of forces that are depriving
    students of the skills needed to meaningfully engage with those books in the first
    place. As a college educator, I am confronted daily with the results of that conspiracy-without-conspirators.
    I have been teaching in small liberal arts colleges for over 15 years now, and
    in the past five years, it’s as though someone flipped a switch. For most of my
    career, I assigned around 30 pages of reading per class meeting as a baseline
    expectation—sometimes scaling up for purely expository readings or pulling back
    for more difficult texts. (No human being can read 30 pages of Hegel in one sitting,
    for example.) Now students are intimidated by anything over 10 pages and seem
    to walk away from readings of as little as 20 pages with no real understanding.
    Even smart and motivated students struggle to do more with written texts than
    extract decontextualized take-aways. Considerable class time is taken up simply
    establishing what happened in a story or the basic steps of an argument—skills
    I used to be able to take for granted.

  zh: 如果真的发生了这种情况，我们仍然不能立即宣布胜利。击败那些试图剥夺学生实际接触书籍机会的公开阴谋，对抗那些剥夺学生真正理解所需技能的更为弥散的力量，这些是两回事。作为一名大学教育工作者，我每天都面对这种没有幕后推手的阴谋的结果。我在小型文理学院教书已经超过15年了，过去五年来，仿佛有人突然打开了一个开关。在我大部分的职业生涯中，每堂课的阅读作业基本上是大约30页，有时会因为纯粹阐述性的阅读而增加，或者因为难度更大的文本而减少。（比如说，没有人可以一口气读完黑格尔的30页。）现在学生们对超过10页的任何东西都感到害怕，甚至对20页的阅读似乎也不能真正理解。即使是聪明和有动力的学生，也难以从书面文本中提取出超越上下文的重要观点。相当多的课堂时间仅仅用于弄清楚故事发生了什么或者一个论点的基本步骤——这些技能过去我曾经认为理所当然。

    it, I talk about it a lot. And when I talk about it with nonacademics, certain
    predictable responses inevitably arise, all questioning the reality of the trend

- en: The response of my fellow academics, however, reassures me that I’m not simply
    indulging in intergenerational grousing. Anecdotally, I have literally never met
    a professor who did not share my experience. Professors are also discussing the
    issue in academic [trade](https://www.insidehighered.com/views/2022/10/17/reading-skills-are-urgent-challenge-higher-ed-opinion)
    [publications](https://www.chronicle.com/article/are-you-assigning-too-much-reading-or-just-too-much-boring-reading/),
    from a variety of perspectives. What we almost all seem to agree on is that we
    are facing *new* obstacles in structuring and delivering our courses, requiring
    us to ratchet down expectations in the face of a ratcheting down of preparation.
    Yes, there were always students who skipped the readings, but we are in new territory
    when even highly motivated honors students struggle to grasp the basic argument
    of a 20-page article. Yes, professors never feel satisfied that high school teachers
    have done enough, but not every generation of professors has had to deal with
    the fallout of No Child Left Behind and Common Core. Finally, yes, every generation
    thinks the younger generation is failing to make the grade—*except* for the current
    cohort of professors, who are by and large more invested in their students’ success
    and mental health and more responsive to student needs than any group of educators
    in human history. We are not complaining about our students. We are complaining
    about what has been taken from them.

- en: If we ask what has caused this change, there are some obvious culprits. The
    first is the same thing that has taken away almost everyone’s ability to focus—the
    ubiquitous smartphone. Even as a career academic who studies the Quran in Arabic
    for fun, I have noticed my reading endurance flagging. I once found myself boasting
    at a faculty meeting that I had read through my entire hourlong train ride without
    looking at my phone. My colleagues agreed this was a major feat, one they had
    not achieved recently. Even if I rarely attain that high level of focus, though,
    I am able to “turn it on” when demanded, for instance to plow through a big novel
    during a holiday break. That’s because I was able to develop and practice those
    skills of extended concentration and attentive reading *before* the intervention
    of the smartphone. For children who were raised with smartphones, by contrast,
    that foundation is missing. It is probably no coincidence that the iPhone itself,
    originally released in 2007, is approaching college age, meaning that professors
    are increasingly dealing with students who would have become addicted to the dopamine
    hit of the omnipresent screen long before they were introduced to the more subtle
    pleasures of the page.

  zh: 如果我们询问是什么导致了这种变化，显然有一些明显的罪魁祸首。首先是那些几乎夺走每个人专注力的同一个东西——无处不在的智能手机。即使是作为一个职业学术界人士，我在用阿拉伯语研究《古兰经》时也注意到我的阅读耐力在下降。曾经在一个教职员会议上，我自吹自擂地说我在整整一小时的火车上阅读而没有看手机。我的同事们都认为这是一个重大成就，他们最近都没有做到过。尽管我很少能达到那种高度的专注，但是，当需要时，比如在假期中翻阅一本大部头的小说时，我能够“打开”它。那是因为在智能手机出现之前，我能够培养和实践延长注意力和专注阅读的技能。然而，对于那些从小被智能手机陪伴长大的孩子们来说，这种基础是缺失的。或许iPhone本身，最初于2007年发布，现在接近上大学年龄，这意味着教授们越来越多地需要面对那些在接触页面的微妙愉悦之前就已经沉迷于普遍屏幕多巴胺刺激的学生们。
- en: The second go-to explanation is the massive disruption of school closures during
    COVID-19\. There is still some debate about the necessity of those measures, but
    what is not up for debate any longer is the [very real learning loss](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/18/opinion/pandemic-school-learning-loss.html)
    that students suffered at every level. The impact will inevitably continue to
    be felt for the next decade or more, until the last cohort affected by the mass
    “pivot to online” finally graduates. I doubt that the pandemic closures were the
    decisive factor in themselves, however. Not only did the marked decline in reading
    resilience start before the pandemic, but the students I am seeing would have
    already been in high school during the school closures. Hence they would be better
    equipped to get something out of the online format and, more importantly, their
    basic reading competence would have already been established.

    little control are the major changes in reading pedagogy that have occurred in
    recent decades—some motivated by the ever-increasing demand to “teach to the test”
    and some by fads coming out of schools of education. In the latter category is
    the widely discussed [decline in phonics education](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/16/us/science-of-reading-literacy-parents.html)
    in favor of the “balanced literacy” approach advocated by education expert Lucy
    Calkins (who has more recently [come to accept](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/22/us/reading-teaching-curriculum-phonics.html)
    the need for more phonics instruction). I started to see the results of this ill-advised
    change several years ago, when students abruptly stopped attempting to sound out
    unfamiliar words and instead paused until they recognized the whole word as a
    unit. (In a recent class session, a smart, capable student was caught short by
    the word *circumstances* when reading a text out loud.) The result of this [vibes-based
    literacy](https://www.newyorker.com/news/annals-of-education/the-rise-and-fall-of-vibes-based-literacy)
    is that students never attain genuine fluency in reading. Even aside from the
    impact of smartphones, their experience of reading is constantly interrupted by
    their *intentionally cultivated* inability to process unfamiliar words.

  zh: 比这些教育者无法控制的更广泛的文化趋势少讨论的是近几十年来阅读教育学上的主要变化——一些是由于“应试教育”需求不断增加所推动的，一些是由教育学院里的时尚潮流所引起的。在后者类别中，是广受讨论的[语音教育的衰退](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/16/us/science-of-reading-literacy-parents.html)，支持由教育专家露西·卡尔金斯提倡的“平衡阅读”方法（她最近[开始接受](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/22/us/reading-teaching-curriculum-phonics.html)更多语音教学的必要性）。我几年前开始看到这种不明智变化的结果，当学生突然停止尝试拼读陌生单词，而是等到他们能够整个单词识别出来为止。（在最近的一次课堂上，一位聪明能干的学生在朗读时被“*circumstances*”这个词难住了。）这种[vibes-based
    literacy](https://www.newyorker.com/news/annals-of-education/the-rise-and-fall-of-vibes-based-literacy)的结果是学生在阅读中从未达到真正的流畅性。即使是在智能手机的影响之外，他们阅读的体验也不断被他们*故意培养的*无法处理陌生词汇的能力打断。

    the [growing trend](https://www.edweek.org/teaching-learning/opinion-why-we-shouldnt-teach-literature-with-excerpts/2019/06)
    toward assigning students *only* the kind of short passages that can be included

    teachers now [have to fight](https://www.forbes.com/sites/petergreene/2018/11/09/common-core-testing-and-the-fracturing-of-literature/?sh=22e8495d13f1)
    to assign their students longer readings, much less entire books, because those
    activities won’t feed directly into students getting higher test scores, which
    leads to schools getting more funding. The emphasis on standardized tests was
    always a distraction at best, but we have reached the point where it is actively
    cannibalizing students’ educational experience—an outcome no one intended or planned,
    and for which there is no possible justification.

    Core standards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Core#Reception_and_criticism)）的变革驱动，教师现在必须努力争取让学生阅读更长的文章，更不用说整本书了，因为这些活动不会直接提高学生成绩，从而导致学校获得更多资金。强调标准化测试一直充其量只是一种干扰，但我们已经达到了一个程度，在这个程度上它正在积极地破坏学生的教育体验——这是没有人预期或计划的结果，也无法有任何可能的正当理由。
