    website -- or on associated content distribution outlets -- be construed as an
    offer soliciting the purchase or sale of any security or interest in any pooled
    investment vehicle sponsored, discussed, or mentioned by a16z personnel. Nor should
    it be construed as an offer to provide investment advisory services; an offer
    to invest in an a16z-managed pooled investment vehicle will be made separately
    and only by means of the confidential offering documents of the specific pooled
    investment vehicles -- which should be read in their entirety, and only to those
    who, among other requirements, meet certain qualifications under federal securities
    laws. Such investors, defined as accredited investors and qualified purchasers,
    are generally deemed capable of evaluating the merits and risks of prospective
    investments and financial matters. There can be no assurances that a16z’s investment
    objectives will be achieved or investment strategies will be successful. Any investment
    in a vehicle managed by a16z involves a high degree of risk including the risk
    that the entire amount invested is lost. Any investments or portfolio companies
    mentioned, referred to, or described are not representative of all investments
    in vehicles managed by a16z and there can be no assurance that the investments
    will be profitable or that other investments made in the future will have similar
    characteristics or results. A list of investments made by funds managed by a16z
    is available at https://a16z.com/investments/. Excluded from this list are investments
    for which the issuer has not provided permission for a16z to disclose publicly
    as well as unannounced investments in publicly traded digital assets. Past results
    of Andreessen Horowitz’s investments, pooled investment vehicles, or investment
    strategies are not necessarily indicative of future results. Please see [https://a16z.com/disclosures](https://a16z.com/disclosures)
