  zh: 亲爱的 Nix 社区成员们，
- en: When I created the [Nix](https://nixos.org/) project as part of my PhD thesis
    research in 2003, I could never have imagined the enthusiasm that people would
    have for it, the [energetic community](https://nixos.org/community/) that would
    grow around it, and the myriad of amazing new things that people would use it
    to help bring to life. I am immeasurably pleased and proud of where the project
    stands today and extremely optimistic for its longevity and utility as a critical
    component of the software delivery pipeline for an ever-growing number of developers,
    teams and businesses.

  zh: 2003 年，我在博士论文研究的一部分创建了[Nix](https://nixos.org/)项目，当时我从未想象到人们对它的热情，[充满活力的社区](https://nixos.org/community/)围绕它成长，并且人们用它帮助实现了许多令人惊叹的新事物。我对项目今天的成就感到无比高兴和自豪，并对它作为软件交付流程中不断增长的开发者、团队和企业的关键组成部分的长期和实用性抱有极大的乐观态度。
- en: 'I co-created and assumed leadership of the NixOS Foundation in 2015 out of
    a sense of duty to further facilitate the rapid growth of the project and the
    community. The Foundation had modest goals: it is intended to provide continuity
    for critical assets like the binary cache, and to provide legal and financial
    support to events like NixCon. It was not intended to “run” the Nix/NixOS community,
    which has done an admirable job in managing itself without top-down control. I
    am glad that I helped to establish the Foundation, and that it continues to serve
    the practical purposes that it should. That said, my participation in the much-needed
    administrative work that the body does is not my passion and I would be happy
    to step away from it at some point in the future.'

  zh: 2015 年，出于促进项目和社区迅速增长的责任感，我共同创立并担任了 NixOS 基金会的领导。基金会的目标较为谦逊：旨在为二进制缓存等关键资产提供持续性，并为
    NixCon 等活动提供法律和财务支持。它并非旨在“管理”Nix/NixOS 社区，该社区在无需自上而下控制的情况下已经做得非常出色。我很高兴能帮助建立基金会，并且它继续履行应尽的实际职能。尽管如此，我参与这个机构所需的许多必要行政工作并非我的热情，未来某个时候我很乐意退出。
- en: In July 2022, I co-founded Determinate Systems, a company that will accelerate
    innovation and adoption of Nix by simplifying its use and helping users get predictably
    great results with it. The company, its mission, and my place in its continued
    development are my focus and passion and are the vehicles through which I am committed
    to continuing to contribute to the development of Nix and the realization of its
    goals.

  zh: 2022 年 7 月，我共同创立了 Determinate Systems，这家公司将通过简化 Nix 的使用并帮助用户预测性地取得优异结果，加速推动
    Nix 的创新和采纳。该公司、其使命以及我在其持续发展中的角色是我的关注点和热情，也是我致力于继续为 Nix 的发展和实现其目标做出贡献的方式。
- en: In recent months, and more intensely in recent days, a number of issues have
    been broached by a small group within the community regarding the governance of
    the project, the foundation, and the community itself. The ongoing debate on these
    issues has been divisive to the community and deleterious to our collective goals.
    I would like to provide clarification regarding a number of misperceptions that
    have been brought to light as a result of the collective discussion.

  zh: 近几个月来，尤其是最近几天，社区内的一个小团体提出了一些关于项目、基金会及社区本身治理的问题。围绕这些问题的持续辩论已经分裂了社区，损害了我们的共同目标。我希望就一些被公开讨论后引发的一些误解提供澄清。
- en: First, I have had very little involvement in Nixpkgs and NixOS in recent years,
    having ceded their stewardship to other community members some time ago, and have
    no more influence over their direction than any other dedicated contributor. Second,
    I am just one member of the five-member Nix team and hold no more formal authority
    than the others in determining the direction of the team. Third, I have not been
    a member of the RFC Steering Committee since new members were elected in January
    2024. Fourth, the NixOS Foundation in no way controls or governs the Nix community,
    which has, since its inception, demonstrated its ability to self-govern very well.

  zh: 首先，近年来我在Nixpkgs和NixOS方面几乎没有参与，早些时候便将它们的管理权交给了其他社区成员，对团队的方向决策没有比其他专注的贡献者更多的影响力。其次，我只是Nix团队五名成员之一，在团队方向决策中没有比其他成员更多的正式权威。第三，自2024年1月新成员选举以来，我不再是RFC指导委员会的成员。第四，NixOS基金会绝不控制或管理Nix社区，自成立以来，社区已经展示了其自我管理的能力。
- en: With regard to the most focal issue raised in recent discussions, that of who
    should or shouldn’t be allowed to sponsor or participate in NixCon, I feel that
    the chief aim of the Nix project is to give developers the tools they need to
    do better work, faster. I strongly believe that we should not exclude any company
    from contributing to, participating in, or utilizing the Nix project in any way.

  zh: 关于最近讨论中提出的最核心问题，即谁应该或不应该被允许赞助或参加NixCon，我认为Nix项目的主要目标是为开发者提供更好、更快的工具。我坚信我们不应该排斥任何公司参与、贡献或以任何方式利用Nix项目。
- en: The nature of open source software is such that anyone, working for any company
    or none, can contribute to and benefit from the work being done by the broader
    community. That companies create products and technologies that some approve of
    and others disapprove of is a simple fact of life. It is my opinion that it is
    not for us, as open source software developers, to decide whose views are valid
    and whose are not, and to allow or disallow project or conference participation
    as a result. We should welcome all contributions that help the project grow and
    thrive. This is a view that I have and will always hold, regardless of my company’s
    involvement in the project.

  zh: 开源软件的性质使得任何人，无论是在任何公司还是没有公司的情况下，都可以为更广泛社区所做的工作做出贡献并从中受益。公司开发某些人认可的产品和技术，而其他人不认可，这是生活的一个简单事实。我认为，作为开源软件开发者，不应该由我们来决定谁的观点是有效的，谁的观点是无效的，也不应该因此允许或禁止项目或会议的参与。我们应该欢迎所有有助于项目成长和繁荣的贡献。这是我持有的观点，也将始终如此，无论我的公司在项目中的参与如何。
- en: 'Regarding alleged conflicts of interest, I want to be very clear. My role,
    participation, and focus on the good work being done at Determinate Systems have
    been public knowledge since the company’s inception. The assertion that Determinate
    Systems “owns” Nix or seeks to exert outsized influence over the project, the
    community, or the foundation is patently false: I am the only member of the Nix
    team who works for Determinate Systems.'

  zh: 关于所谓的利益冲突问题，我要非常明确。从公司成立以来，我的角色、参与和专注于Determinate Systems所做的优秀工作，一直是公开的信息。称Determinate
    Systems“拥有”Nix或试图对项目、社区或基金会施加过大影响的说法显然是错误的：我是Nix团队中唯一一位在Determinate Systems工作的成员。
- en: Last, I must express my deep disappointment and disbelief at the accusation
    of excluding people from minority or marginalized backgrounds. As someone who
    highly values diversity and inclusion, this accusation is not only unfounded but
    also insulting. Throughout my career, I have consistently supported work towards
    creating a welcoming and inclusive environment for all individuals, regardless
    of their background. I continue to support initiatives to ensure that everyone
    feels valued and appreciated, and I have actively encouraged opportunities to
    amplify the voices of those who have been historically marginalized.

  zh: 最后，我必须表达我对排斥少数民族或边缘化群体成员的指控深感失望和难以置信。作为一个高度重视多样性和包容性的人，这种指控不仅毫无根据，而且令人感到侮辱。在我的职业生涯中，我始终支持为所有背景的个人创造一个包容和欢迎的环境的工作。我继续支持倡议，确保每个人都感到受到重视和赏识，并积极鼓励增强历史上被边缘化群体声音的机会。
- en: I remain committed to creating a community where everyone feels seen, heard,
    and valued, and I will not let unfounded accusations detract from this important
    work. I encourage everyone reading this who feels that they have not been heard
