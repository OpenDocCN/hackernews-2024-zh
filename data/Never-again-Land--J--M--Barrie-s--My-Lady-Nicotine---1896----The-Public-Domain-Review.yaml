- en: 'Before he conceived of Peter Pan, J. M. Barrie decided it was time to grow
    up and quit smoking. He justifies this decision in *My Lady Nicotine: A Study
    in Smoke* (originally published in 1890), which begins with a common trio of arguments
    against substance addiction. The bodily and spiritual ruin; the economic impact;
    the pain caused to loved ones. In the case of our narrator (who seems to be a
    lightly fictionalized Barrie): he felt frequently like he was dying; realized
    several oriental rugs could be purchased yearly with the money saved; and delayed
    his marriage six months when his fiancée demanded cessation. Slowly, however,
    this “study” diffuses into a different mode. At the introduction’s close, fidgeting
    in the drawing room with postprandial cravings, he listens to his wife sing a
    sweet and mournful song, which takes his thoughts far away, to a parlor on the
    top floor of an inn, where time seems to slow as his body''s hunger warmly fades,
    like coals in the hearth that throw light around this room — onto newspapers,
    through smoke rings, across the faces of gentleman friends, and against the contours
    of a tobacco jar. It’s a lost world, once known so well, and he pulls up a chair
    and begins to pack a pipe. “After a time the music ceases, and my wife puts her
    hand on my shoulder. Perhaps I start a little, and then she says I have been asleep.
    This is the book of my dreams.”'

  zh: J·M·巴里在构思彼得·潘之前，决定长大并戒烟。他在《我的尼古丁夫人：一段吸烟的研究》（最初出版于1890年）中为此决定辩护，书中以反对物质成瘾的常见三个论点开篇：身体和精神的毁坏；经济上的影响；对所爱之人造成的痛苦。在我们的叙述者（似乎是轻微虚构的巴里）的案例中：他经常感觉自己快要死了；意识到每年可以用省下的钱购买几块东方地毯；并因未婚妻要求戒烟而推迟了六个月的婚事。然而，这个“研究”慢慢地演变成了一种不同的模式。在序言结束时，他在客厅里坐立不安，被饭后的烟草渴望折磨着，听着妻子唱着一首甜美而悲伤的歌，这使他的思绪远离，回到了一个客栈的顶层客厅，在那里时间似乎放慢了步伐，他身体的饥饿温暖地消退，如同炉子里的煤炭，照亮这个房间
    — 照在报纸上，穿过烟圈，映在绅士朋友的脸上，照在烟草罐的轮廓上。这是一个曾经非常熟悉的失落世界，他拉过一把椅子，开始装烟斗。“过了一会儿，音乐停止了，我的妻子把手放在我的肩上。也许我有点惊吓，然后她说我已经睡着了。这是我梦境的书。”
