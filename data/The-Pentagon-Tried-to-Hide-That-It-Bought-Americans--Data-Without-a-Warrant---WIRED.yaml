- en: United States officials fought to conceal details of arrangements between US
    spy agencies and private companies tracking the whereabouts of Americans via their
    cell phones. Obtaining location data from US phones normally requires a warrant,
    but police and intelligence agencies routinely pay companies instead for the data,
    effectively circumventing the courts.

- en: Ron Wyden, the US senator from Oregon, informed the nation’s intelligence chief,
    Avril Haines, on Thursday that the Pentagon only agreed to release details about
    the data purchases, which had always been unclassified, after Wyden hindered the
    Senate's efforts to appoint a new director of the National Security Agency. “The
    secrecy around data purchases was amplified,” Wyden wrote, “because intelligence
    agencies have sought to keep the American people in the dark."

  zh: 来自俄勒冈州的美国参议员罗恩·怀登（Ron Wyden）于周四通知国家情报总监艾弗里尔·海因斯，五角大楼仅在怀登阻碍参议院任命新国家安全局局长的努力后才同意公布始终未分类的数据购买详细信息。怀登写道：“围绕数据购买的秘密加大了，因为情报机构一直试图让美国民众处于黑暗中。”
- en: Wyden's office says it’s been investigating sales of location data to the government
    for years, uncovering multiple ties between the Department of Defense and what
    the senator refers to as “shady companies" committing “flagrant violations” of
    people's privacy. The companies' practices are “not just unethical, but illegal,”
    he says.

  zh: 怀登的办公室表示，多年来一直在调查向政府出售位置数据的公司，发现国防部和参议员所指的“不法公司”之间存在多重联系，这些公司在侵犯人们隐私方面存在“公然违法行为”。他说，这些公司的做法“不仅不道德，而且违法”。
- en: Pentagon offices known to have purchased location data from these companies
    include the Defense Intelligence Agency and the NSA, among others. Wyden's letter,
    first reported by [*The New York Times*](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/25/us/politics/nsa-internet-privacy-warrant.html?unlocked_article_code=1.QU0.YdWh.n51FMReztrOH),

  zh: 五角大楼办公室已知从这些公司购买位置数据，包括国防情报局和NSA等。由[*纽约时报*](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/25/us/politics/nsa-internet-privacy-warrant.html?unlocked_article_code=1.QU0.YdWh.n51FMReztrOH)首次报道的Wyden的信件表明，NSA也在“购买美国国内互联网元数据”。
- en: Wyden's disclosure comes amid a fight in the US House of Representatives over
    efforts to outlaw the purchases entirely. Last month, members of the House Judiciary
    Committee attached legislation doing so, known as the *Fourth Amendment Is Not
    For Sale Act*, to a bill reauthorizing a contentious surveillance program known
    as Section 702.

  zh: 怀登的披露发生在美国众议院就彻底禁止这些购买的争论中。上个月，众议院司法委员会的成员将旨在这样做的立法（第四修正案不能出售法案）附加到一项重新授权备受争议的监视计划第702条的法案上。
- en: The bill, originally coauthored by Wyden, nearly received a vote last month
    during a showdown with rival legislation introduced by the House Intelligence
    Committee that does not seek to ban the purchases. Congressional sources tell
    WIRED the vote was called off at the last minute after Biden administration officials
    and members of the intelligence committee staged a campaign against the privacy-enhancing
    measures.

  zh: 最初由怀登共同撰写的该法案在上个月几乎在与众议院情报委员会提出不寻求禁止这些购买的对立立法的对决中获得了投票。国会消息人士告诉WIRED，此次投票在最后一刻被叫停，之前拜登政府官员和情报委员会成员发起了一场反对加强隐私保护措施的运动。
- en: Intelligence officials in the House held separate meetings with members and
    their aides aiming to discourage support for the judiciary bill—the *Protect Liberty
    Act*—alleging that new warrant requirements would be overly burdensome for law
    enforcement, despite a slew of exemptions for cyberwarfare, terrorism, and espionage

  zh: 众议院情报官员向成员和他们的助手举行单独会议，以阻止他们支持司法法案—— *保护自由法案* ——称新的授权要求对执法机构来说过于繁重，尽管针对网络战、恐怖主义和间谍威胁有一系列豁免条款。
- en: Six sources who attended the meetings told WIRED that intelligence committee
    members used images of Hamas militants in presentations to drive home its argument
    for relaxing limits on domestic surveillance. The message, Republican aides said,
    was, “it could happen here.” Three Democrats who attended meetings with representatives
    from the FBI, CIA, and NSA, among other agencies, described the presentation as
    a “scare tactic.”

  zh: 出席会议的六位消息人士告诉《连线》杂志，情报委员会成员在演示中使用哈马斯激进分子的图片，以强调放宽国内监视限制的论点。共和党助手表示，这个信息是“可能在这里发生”。三位参加会议的民主党人表示，与FBI、CIA和NSA等其他机构的代表会谈中，这种演示是一种“恐吓战术”。
- en: The home surveillance debate, which has exploded in recent months, hampering
    the passing of routine legislation, has largely focused on Section 702, an authority
    under which the government monitors the calls, texts, and emails of foreign nationals.
    Section 702 is set to expire in under four months.

  zh: 近几个月来，国内监控辩论激烈，妨碍了常规立法的通过，主要集中在第702条下，政府可以监听外国公民的电话、短信和电子邮件。第702条将在不到四个月内到期。
- en: 'Both the *Protect Liberty Act* and its intelligence committee rival—the *FISA
    Reform and Reauthorization Act*—aim to reauthorize Section 702 into the future.
    In how that''s accomplished the bills are radically different. With access by
    the FBI to foreign intelligence for domestic investigations being the biggest
    point of contention, federal lawmakers can now effectively be divided into two
    factions: people who support surveillance warrants and people who don''t.'

  zh: 《保护自由法案》和其情报委员会的竞争对手——《FISA改革和再授权法案》的目标都是将第702条条文重新授权到未来。在实现这一目标的方式上，这两个法案存在着根本性的不同。对FBI获取国外情报用于国内调查的访问权限是最大争议点，联邦立法者现在可以有效地分成两派：支持监视许可证的人和反对的人。
- en: The pro-warrant *Protect Liberty Ac*t could receive a vote as early as next
    month, with its provisions banning the government from buying data as a means
    of evading warrant requirements. Republicans on the Hill say they can't be sure
    whether House Speaker Mike Johnson will allow a vote, however, due to the intense
    amount of pressure he faces from the intelligence system.

  zh: 支持监视许可证的《保护自由法案》可能在下个月就会接受投票，其中的规定禁止政府通过购买数据来逃避监视许可要求。然而，国会山的共和党人表示，由于受到情报体系的巨大压力，他们不确定众议院发言人迈克·约翰逊是否会允许投票。
- en: “There is a lot of baloney going around about surveillance reform," Wyden says.
    “Probably because some surveillance supporters are worried they won’t win an honest
    debate.”
