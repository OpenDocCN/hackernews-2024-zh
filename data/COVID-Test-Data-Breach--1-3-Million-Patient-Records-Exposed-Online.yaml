- en: The publicly exposed database contained an estimated 1.3 million records that
    included 118,441 certificates, 506,663 appointments, 660,173 testing samples,
    and a small number of internal application files. The exposed certificates and
    other documents were all marked with the name and logo of Coronalab.eu. Although
    the website appears to be offline, Coronalab is owned by Microbe & Lab, an ISO-certified
    laboratory based in Amsterdam, Netherlands. According to the [NL Times](https://nltimes.nl/2020/10/02/dutch-businesses-increasingly-turning-commercial-covid-tests),
    “CoronaLab is one of the two largest commercial test providers in the Netherlands”.
    I sent multiple responsible disclosure notices and did not receive any reply and
    several phone calls also yielded no results. The database remained open for nearly
    3 weeks before I contacted the cloud hosting provider and it was finally secured
    from public access. In most cases the organization replies or closes public access
    immediately after receiving a responsible disclosure notice. Another research-based
    online publication, Cybernews, claimed to have found a similar leak around the
    same time of my discovery. I cannot confirm if it's related or not.

    Coronalab.eu 的名称和标志。尽管该网站似乎已经下线，但 Coronalab 是 Microbe & Lab 的子公司，Microbe & Lab
    是一家位于荷兰阿姆斯特丹的ISO认证实验室。根据[NL Times](https://nltimes.nl/2020/10/02/dutch-businesses-increasingly-turning-commercial-covid-tests)的说法，“CoronaLab是荷兰两家最大的商业测试提供商之一”。我发送了多份负责任的披露通知，但没有收到任何回复，打了几个电话也没有结果。在我联系云托管提供商并最终将其从公开访问中保护之前，数据库已经开放了将近3周。在大多数情况下，组织在收到负责任的披露通知后会立即回复或关闭公共访问。另一家基于研究的在线出版物
    Cybernews 声称在我发现这一漏洞的同时发现了一个类似的泄漏。我无法确认它是否相关。
- en: The exposed COVID test records contained each patient’s name, nationality, passport
    number, and test results, as well as the price, location, and type of test conducted.
    The database also contained thousands of QR codes and hundreds of.csv files that
    showed appointment details and many patients’ email addresses. With personal data
    and emails exposed, cybercriminals could attempt to exploit this information or
    launch targeted phishing campaigns using internal information or posing as a laboratory
    employee. The criminal could potentially reference test dates, locations, or other
    insider information that only the patient and the laboratory would know. Any potential
    exposure involving COVID test data combined with PII could potentially compromise
    the personal and medical privacy of the individuals listed in the documents.

- en: During the height of the pandemic, proof of a negative COVID test was required
    for nearly all everyday life activities. In many cases, testing was often mandatory
    for travel, special events, and even employment. There was a massive amount of
    COVID test data collected in a short period of time, which needed to be accessible
    for patients or verifications, yet still secure from unauthorized access. Even
    under normal conditions, data and cloud storage infrastructure takes time to build,
    test, and properly configure. The speed of the pandemic and the massive amount
    of testing data forced many laboratories and medical facilities around the world
    to rush the process. This increased the risk for permission and configuration
    errors in data storage and data protection. In my professional opinion, now that
    the pandemic is mostly behind us, it is time for organizations to review the massive
    amounts of data they have stored and determine if these records are still needed.
    If they are, organizations must ensure the data is secured from unauthorized access.
    The records should be encrypted or anonymized to prevent unwanted data exposures
    or threats from malicious actors.

    测试数据，这些数据需要对患者或验证者可访问，同时还需要防止未经授权的访问。即使在正常情况下，数据和云存储基础设施也需要时间来构建、测试和正确配置。疫情的速度以及大量的测试数据迫使全球许多实验室和医疗机构加速了这一过程。这增加了数据存储和数据保护中的许可和配置错误的风险。在我看来，现在疫情基本过去了，是时候让组织审查他们存储的大量数据，并确定这些记录是否仍然需要。如果需要，组织必须确保数据免受未经授权的访问。记录应该加密或匿名化，以防止不必要的数据曝光或来自恶意行为者的威胁。

    COVID 测试呈阳性，因为害怕遭受污名化。目前尚不清楚是否有其他人获取了泄露的 COVID 测试数据。
- en: The public exposure of COVID tests has a range of potential future risks due
    to the fact that so much is still unknown about the long-term health effects of
    the virus, and we don’t know how pandemic-era data could be used years later.
    Hypothetically, insurers could raise premium rates if research showed that those
    who were infected with the virus had a higher risk of future health issues. Overall,
    leaked COVID test results not only pose risks to personal and medical privacy,
    but they could also affect how patients view public healthcare providers and how
    much they trust them to safeguard their medical data. It's crucial for healthcare
    organizations and technology providers to prioritize data security, including
    data storage and cybersecurity measures. Another important issue healthcare providers
    must face is to implement clear record retention policies to determine how long
    medical records should be kept and how to prevent the risks associated with data
    that is no longer being actively used.

    COVID 测试结果不仅对个人和医疗隐私构成风险，还可能影响患者对公共医疗提供者的看法以及他们信任医疗数据安全的程度。医疗组织和技术提供商有必要优先考虑数据安全，包括数据存储和网络安全措施。医疗提供者必须面对的另一个重要问题是制定明确的记录保留政策，以确定医疗记录应该保留多长时间以及如何防止与不再主动使用的数据相关的风险。

    intended to be private. Exposed passport details — such as the document number,
    full name, date of birth, and nationality — could be potentially valuable pieces
    of information for identity thieves and cyber criminals. Passport data has the
    potential to be misused for various fraudulent activities, ranging from travel-related
    fraud (such as booking flights, renting cars, or hotel reservations) to opening
    financial accounts in the passport holder's name. I am not implying that the people
    whose passports were exposed were ever at imminent risk; I only mean to provide
    a real-world example of potential repercussions.

    (QR) code can store various types of data, such as website URLs, text, contact
    information, or commands. Nearly every phone camera can scan a QR code without
    any additional software. When QR codes store and transmit sensitive data (such
    as personal details, passport data, and medical test results) in plain text, the
    codes represent a potential security risk in case they are publicly exposed. In
    this instance, I was able to scan numerous QR codes and see the test results and
    all the confidential personal data they contained. As useful and as user friendly
    as QR codes are, they can be a major security risk. For example, the codes can
    be easily changed to redirect users to fake websites or prompt them to download
    malware or other malicious applications. I highly recommend any organization that
    uses QR codes containing personal information to implement proper security measures
    to safeguard sensitive data. Encrypting the information, for instance, can help
    prevent potential threats to privacy and security.
