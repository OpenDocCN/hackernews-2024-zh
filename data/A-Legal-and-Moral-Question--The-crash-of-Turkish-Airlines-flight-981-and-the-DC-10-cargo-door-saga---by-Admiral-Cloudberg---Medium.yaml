    The president of America’s largest airline wanted a wide body jet that could carry
    300 to 400 people across the country, but was smaller than the Boeing 747 and
    could take off from regular runways. But before McDonnell Douglas could even begin
    drafting a proposal, rival manufacturer Lockheed announced that it would produce
    the L-1011 TriStar: a wide body, three-engine jet that would meet all of American
    Airlines’ specifications. Two months later, despite not having any concrete plans,
    McDonnell Douglas announced that it would build the same thing, except better,
    and they would get it done faster. After all, if Lockheed captured this new market,

- en: 'As the frantic effort to produce a new wide-body jet got underway, McDonnell
    Douglas adopted a mantra of “Fly before they roll:” in other words, the goal was
    for the DC-10 to make its maiden flight before the first L-1011 had emerged from
    the hangar. In order to raise capital, both manufacturers courted orders from
    America’s largest airlines, and the battle lines were drawn: TWA and Eastern chose
    the L-1011, while American and United opted for the DC-10\. The airlines pressed
    hard for the features they wanted, knowing that the manufacturers could not refuse
    for fear of losing the order, and both companies scrambled to design and build
    all the thousands of pieces that go into an airliner in as short a time as possible.
    But while Lockheed wanted the L-1011 to advance the state of the industry and
    introduce radical new technological concepts, McDonnell Douglas preferred to stick
    with what it already understood: don’t try anything that hasn’t been tried before,
    and get it done quickly.'

    they were in a delicate situation. If he tried to turn too far to the left using
    the ailerons, this could, counterintuitively, result in a spin to the right. To
    turn left, the ailerons increase the angle of attack of the right wing and reduce
    the angle of attack of the left wing, causing the right wing to generate more
    lift and turn the plane. But in such an extreme right yaw, the right wing was
    already in danger of stalling and spiraling in; therefore, using too much left
    aileron could push the angle of attack beyond the critical point and cause a catastrophic
    loss of lift on the right side. McCormick managed to solve this problem by making
    his turns primarily with the engines, using differential thrust to adjust their
    heading, while holding the ailerons just far enough left to keep the wings level.

  zh: 当麦科米克船长慢慢地将飞机驶回底特律时，他知道他们处于一个微妙的境地。如果他试图使用副翼向左转弯太远，这可能会产生相反的结果，导致向右旋转。要左转，副翼会增加右翼的攻角并减小左翼的攻角，使右翼产生更多升力并转动飞机。但在如此极端的右偏航中，右翼已经有陷入失速和螺旋下降的危险；因此，使用过多的左副翼可能会将攻角推至临界点之外，并导致右侧失去升力的灾难性损失。麦科米克设法通过主要使用引擎进行转弯，利用差动推力调整它们的航向，同时将副翼保持在足够向左的位置以保持机翼水平，解决了这个问题。

    value, which forced Captain McCormick to increase engine power. This in turn meant

    the cargo hold would not have been catastrophic were it not for one critical side
    effect. As it turned out, when the hold depressurized, the passenger cabin above
    it did not. This created a pressure differential between the cabin and the hold
    which amounted to several tons per square meter, a force that the floor was not

    doors are designed based on this principle. But a cargo door that is also a plug
    door would be impractical because of its size, which greatly increases the forces

    round latch spools attached to the doorframe. An electric motor called the latch
    actuator then drives the latches clockwise around the spools using a hinged extension
    mechanism. When the arm of the latch actuator is fully extended, the hinge is
    pushed “over-center,” and the only way to bend the hinge back the other way is
    to retract the actuator arm. Any force transmitted through the latches themselves
    will attempt to push the hinge even farther over-center, which is rendered impossible
    by a metal stop that limits the movement of the hinge. This stop absorbs most
    of the forces acting upon the door in flight. However, if the hinges are not over-center,
    pressurization loads imparted through the latches will not be absorbed by the
    stop, but will instead be transmitted up the latch actuator arm and into the bolts
    attaching the actuator to the door. These bolts cannot withstand the pressure

    the locking pins will run into flanges on the hinges and come to a stop, preventing
    the handle from moving to the locked position. If the hinges are over-center,

    feature that Boeing used on the 747, which had a somewhat similar door design.
    The 747 had a small plug-type “vent door” within the cargo door, which was driven
    closed by the lock tube itself; if the lock tube did not fully extend, the vent
    door would not close, indicating that the door was not locked. Furthermore, if
    the vent door was not closed, pressure would leak out as soon as the plane started
    climbing, preventing an improperly locked door from failing catastrophically at
    altitude. But when McDonnell Douglas copied this feature, they made a crucial
    mistake: unlike Boeing’s design, their vent door was driven by the torque tube
    attached to the locking handle instead of the lock tube. The result was that the
    vent door simply indicated the position of the locking handle, and could not warn
    of a failure of the locking mechanism. This was especially problematic given that
    the mechanism was extremely weak, and the torque tube would bend under as little
    as 80 pounds (355 Newtons) of force, well within the capability of the average

    DC-10 was certainly no exception. Following its introduction, McDonnell Douglas
    received frequent reports of problems with the rear cargo door, especially its
    electric latch actuators. The company had originally planned to use a hydraulic
    actuator, which was more reliable and would always apply positive pressure, unlike
    an electric actuator, which could act on the latch mechanism only when turned
    on. But American Airlines had requested an electric actuator because it was lighter
    and easier to maintain, so McDonnell Douglas acquiesced. In service, however,
    the electric actuators turned out to be a major annoyance, because they suffered
    frequent voltage drops that prevented them from driving the latches fully closed.
    Ground personnel had to latch the doors manually using a crank. To solve these
    recurring problems, in 1972 McDonnell Douglas devised a more robust wire which
    would mitigate the voltage drops, and issued a service bulletin encouraging DC-10
    operators to install it. But the change was voluntary, and airlines were slow
    to adopt it; by the time of the flight 96 incident, American Airlines had yet
    to fit the new wire to its DC-10 cargo doors.

  zh: 任何新飞机首次投入使用时都可能会出现问题，DC-10当然也不例外。在其投入使用后，麦克唐纳·道格拉斯公司频繁收到有关后货舱门问题的报告，尤其是其电动锁扣致动器的问题。公司最初计划使用液压致动器，这种致动器更可靠且总是施加正压力，而不像电动致动器只有在打开时才能对锁扣机构起作用。但是，美国航空公司要求使用电动致动器，因为它更轻便且易于维护，所以麦克唐纳·道格拉斯公司妥协了。然而，在使用过程中，电动致动器被证明是一个主要的困扰，因为它们经常出现电压下降，导致无法完全关闭锁扣。地勤人员不得不使用曲柄手动锁上门。为了解决这些反复出现的问题，麦克唐纳·道格拉斯公司于1972年设计了一种更健壮的电线，以减轻电压下降，并发布了一个服务公告，鼓励DC-10操作者安装它。但是这个改变是自愿的，而且航空公司采用它的速度很慢；到飞行96事件时，美国航空公司还没有给其DC-10货舱门安装新的电线。

    handler William Eggert loaded the coffin and several bags into the rear cargo
    hold, then moved to close the door. But as he held down the button to drive the
    latch actuator, the voltage dropped and the actuator stopped before the hinges
    could move over-center. Eggert then moved to close the locking handle, only to
    find that it would not close all the way. He had no idea that this might be a
    sign that the door was not fully latched, nor did he know that trying to force
    it would cause mechanical damage, and so he decided to apply more force to the
    handle using his knee. The locking pins then ran into the sides of the flanges
    and stopped, the torque tube bent downward in the middle, the locking handle moved
    into the locked position, and the cockpit warning light went out. But the vent
    door didn’t quite close, so Eggert called over his supervisor for advice. The
    supervisor explained that this was a common occurrence, and that it was not dangerous
    since the pressure would force the vent door into its frame once the plane started
    climbing. All systems intended to ensure that the door was properly closed had
    now been overcome, and American Airlines flight 96 took to the air without anyone
    realizing that its rear cargo door had become a ticking time bomb. As the plane
    climbed, the pressure acting on the door was transmitted through the hinges and
    into the latch actuator bolts, until the bolts sheared off under the strain at
    11,750 feet, causing the cargo door to depart the airplane.

- en: As a result of its findings, the NTSB recommended that the Federal Aviation
    Administration require McDonnell Douglas to redesign the door locking system so
    that it would be “physically impossible to position the external locking handle
    and vent door to their normal locking positions unless the locking pins are fully
    engaged.” Concerned about the collapse of the floor and its potential to lead
    to a loss of control, the NTSB also recommended that the FAA require vents to
    be installed in the cabin floor which will open to relieve the pressure if the
    cargo hold depressurizes in flight. (A few such vents already existed for air
    circulation purposes, but they were too small to handle an explosive decompression.)
    This was in fact the most pressing concern for the NTSB, because while the cargo
    door was certainly dangerous, it was the collapse of the floor that was likely
    to lead to the loss of the airplane in such an event, and indeed the crew of flight
    96 had only escaped disaster by the thinnest of margins.

  zh: 该交易于1972年9月底达成，留给准备飞机和航空公司的时间非常有限，直到圣诞节。 大多数欧洲航空公司计划花两年时间将DC-10纳入其机队； 土耳其航空希望在十二周内完成。
    在这个疯狂的赶时间中，一个关键步骤被错过了：没有人给机身#29安装扭矩管支撑板，也没有延长其锁定管的最大伸展长度。 尽管如此，麦克唐纳道格拉斯告诉土耳其航空，门的修改已经完成，并且两项任务的工作卡均由麦克唐纳道格拉斯检查员盖章，尽管工作并未完成。
    也不能完成-盖章日期为1972年7月18日，早于任何修复指令的草拟日期。 另一架飞机，机身#47，后来发现存在完全相同的问题，表明这不是个案。

    as well. The lock tube was nearly 8mm short of the correct position, which meant
    that the locking pins only partially overlapped the flanges even at full extension,
    instead of passing beyond them. Most probably someone had attempted to extend
    the lock tube but simply twisted it the wrong way. In this mis-rigged position,
    the lock tube didn’t move far enough to consistently extinguish the door warning
    light in the cockpit, so someone had welded several shims onto the end of the
    lock tube to improve its contact with the switch. The problem was that with the
    addition of the shims, the lock tube would strike the switch and extinguish the
    warning light before the locking pins moved into the locked position, rendering
    the warning pointless.'

  zh: 航班#29机身的货舱门有一些其他问题。 锁定管几乎比正确位置短了8毫米，这意味着锁定销只在完全伸展时部分重叠了法兰，而不是穿过它们。 最有可能是有人试图延长锁定管，但是只是将其扭曲到了错误的方向。
    在这种错误安装的位置上，锁定管没有移动到足以始终熄灭驾驶舱内的门警告灯的位置，因此有人在锁定管的末端焊接了几个垫片，以改善其与开关的接触。 问题是，随着垫片的增加，锁定管会击中开关并在锁定销移动到锁定位置之前熄灭警告灯，使警告变得毫无意义。

    were made by McDonnell Douglas or Turkish Airlines. Forensic evidence showed that
    they must have been carried out after the plane arrived in Turkey, although Douglas
    engineers continued to perform maintenance on it for some time following its arrival.
    But if it was Turkish Airlines that made the adjustments, that would not have
    surprised any of the Douglas employees who were charged with helping THY incorporate
    the DC-10 into its fleet. In fact, it was obvious that selling the DC-10 to THY
    in the first place was a dubious idea. There was no hangar at Istanbul Airport
    that was big enough for a DC-10, so all maintenance work had to be done with the
    tail sticking out into the weather. The only runway at the airport long enough
    for a DC-10 was in a state of disrepair. Turkish Airlines had to rush the DC-10
    training course for its pilots; there was hardly anyone in Turkey who was qualified
    even to start flight engineer training; the flight engineers they did manage to
    find had no idea what they were doing; ground engineers complained that their
    training was rushed and they didn’t understand English well enough to read the
    manuals; spare parts were hard to procure; turnaround times were too short to
    complete maintenance tasks; and all the documentation almost immediately disappeared.

    tests of the first DC-10 hull when the cargo door exploded open, causing a blast

    instead of considering whether the design of the door itself was flawed, Douglas
    blamed the failure on human error by a mechanic. Technically this might have been

    violently, possibly resulting in the loss of the airplane, if one lowly mechanic
    deviated slightly from proper procedure, was quite simply an accident waiting
    to happen. But McDonnell Douglas never wavered from its belief that human error
    was the only cause of cargo door failures, as the company blamed the Windsor incident
    on ground agent William Eggert, and even attempted initially to pin the Turkish
    airlines disaster on the “illiterate” baggage handler Mohammed Mahmoudi, who hadn’t

    a few minor changes to the design of the door. The incident led to the addition
    of the manual locking handle and the vent door, which didn’t resolve the underlying
    problem (that it was possible to pressurize the airplane even if the latches were
    not over-center, eventually leading to an explosive decompression). The vent door
    was of course meant to solve this, but it was entirely useless because it was
    not driven by the locking pins and thus could not indicate whether the hinges
    were over-center. Furthermore, the FAA failed to discover this obvious design
    flaw during certification of the airplane. In fact, 75% of the DC-10’s certification
    items were handled by FAA-designated engineers who worked for McDonnell Douglas,
    a practice known as delegation. Delegation is necessary to some extent because
    the FAA lacks enough staff to certify every part of every new airplane. But in
    this case, the engineer who the FAA had assigned to certify the vent door was
    the same man who had conducted the tests of the door on behalf of McDonnell Douglas.
    This was a conflict of interest and violated the principle of having a second
    set of eyes. As a result, the engineer failed to notice the problem, and the FAA
    accepted that the vent door met regulatory requirements even though it clearly
    did not.

    if the vent door had remained open when the locking pins didn’t engage) McDonnell
    Douglas had another opportunity to rethink its door design. But doing so would
    be costly, and besides, in McDonnell Douglas’s view it was the baggage handler’s
    fault. However, the head of the Western regional office of the FAA, which oversaw
    McDonnell Douglas, clearly saw the danger of the cargo door design, and knew that
    it would eventually need to issue a mandatory Airworthiness Directive (AD) legally
    requiring the manufacturer to implement a redesign or risk the planes being grounded.
    While various parties explored a design solution, the Western regional office
    planned to issue a series of ADs mandating interim fixes, beginning with a requirement
    to implement McDonnell Douglas’s improvement to the latch actuator wire. But before
    the office could finish drafting even this first most insignificant directive,
    Jackson McGowen, president of the Douglas division of McDonnell Douglas, telephoned
    FAA Administrator John Shaffer in order to intervene. McGowen feared that an Airworthiness
    Directive, which is public and would be released to the media, might harm sales
    of the DC-10 relative to the L-1011\. McGowen allegedly promised that the DC-10s
    would be fixed “by Friday” and that there was no need for an AD; everything could

    its specifications, began to express concern about the design of the aircraft’s
    floor. Shortly after the Windsor incident, Dan Applegate, the head of product
    engineering at Convair, wrote a memo urging his superior J. B. Hurt to take his
    concerns about the DC-10’s floor to McDonnell Douglas. In no uncertain terms,
    Applegate explained that even if the fundamentally flawed cargo door was fixed,
    the floor design could still lead to disaster. In his memo, he wrote: *“It seems
    to me inevitable that, in the 20 years ahead of us, DC‐10 cargo doors will come
    open and cargo compartments will experience decompression for other reasons, and
    I would expect this to usually result in the loss of the airplane.”* Furthermore,
    because Convair was aware that this could occur, the company could be exposed
    to liability in these future accidents. The solution, in Applegate’s mind, was
    to make sure McDonnell Douglas changed the design of the floor as quickly as possible.
    (Convair, while responsible for fabricating the fuselage including the floor,
    had no authority to change the design unilaterally.)'

    wrong with Applegate’s argument, he wrote in his official reply — the possibility
    of failure was real, as was the likelihood that Convair would be held liable in
    the event of a crash. But Hurt explained that McDonnell Douglas already knew about
    this potential for catastrophe, and if Convair brought it up to them that could
    be a liability in and of itself, because the terms of their contract stated that
    Convair was required to raise an objection to any design elements that it felt
    were unsafe *prior to the fabrication of those elements*. Obviously they had not
    done this, which meant that Convair could be found legally in breach of its contract
    if it revealed these concerns only after the floors had been built and installed
    on airplanes. The considerable expense of retroactively changing the floor design
    could thus be placed on Convair. (Unstated in either memo was the fact that Convair
    had little choice but to agree to Douglas’s design decisions.) Furthermore, Hurt
    believed that McDonnell Douglas’s lack of action to fix the floor meant that they
    were waiting for an excuse to make Convair pay for it. J. B. Hurt called this
    “an interesting legal and moral problem.” And in the end, he chose the legal over

    and also knowing that airlines had reported over 1,000 issues with the DC-10s
    rear cargo door (a rate of more than 10 per plane at the time), McDonnell Douglas
    actively campaigned to avoid any binding requirement to fix this obvious danger.

    the true magnitude of the threat, it is conceivable that he wouldn’t have allowed
    McDonnell Douglas to get away with making pinky promises in lieu of an Airworthiness
