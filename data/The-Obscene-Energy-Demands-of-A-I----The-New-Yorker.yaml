- en: In 2016, Alex de Vries read somewhere that a single bitcoin transaction consumes
    as much energy as the average American household uses in a day. At the time, de
    Vries, who is Dutch, was working at a consulting firm. In his spare time, he wrote
    a blog, called Digiconomist, about the risks of investing in cryptocurrency. He
    found the energy-use figure disturbing.

  zh: 2016年，亚历克斯·德·弗里斯在某处读到，一笔比特币交易的能耗相当于平均美国家庭一天的用电量。当时，荷兰人德·弗里斯在一家咨询公司工作。他利用业余时间写了一个关于投资加密货币风险的博客，名为Digiconomist。他发现这个能源消耗数据令人不安。
- en: “I was, like, O.K., that’s a massive amount, and why is no one talking about
    it?” he told me recently over Zoom. “I tried to look up some data, but I couldn’t
    really find anything.” De Vries, then twenty-seven, decided that he would have
    to come up with the information himself. He put together what he called the Bitcoin
    Energy Consumption Index, and posted it on [Digiconomist](https://digiconomist.net/).
    According to the index’s latest figures, bitcoin mining now consumes a hundred
    and forty-five billion kilowatt-hours of electricity per year, which is more than
    is used by the entire nation of the Netherlands, and producing that electricity
    results in eighty-one million tons of CO[2], which is more than the annual emissions
    of a nation like Morocco. De Vries subsequently began to track the electronic
    waste produced by bitcoin mining—an iPhone’s worth for every transaction—and its
    water use—which is something like two trillion litres per year. (The water goes
    toward cooling the servers used in mining, and the e-waste is produced by servers
    that have become out of date.)

  zh: “我当时感觉，哇，这是一个巨大的数字，为什么没有人谈论它？”他最近在Zoom上告诉我。“我试图查找一些数据，但实际上找不到什么。”德·弗里斯当时二十七岁，决定他必须自己收集这些信息。他组织了所谓的比特币能源消耗指数，并将其发布在[Digiconomist](https://digiconomist.net/)上。根据该指数的最新数据，比特币挖掘现在每年消耗一百四十五亿千瓦时的电力，这比荷兰整个国家使用的电力还多，而生产这些电力则导致八千一百万吨二氧化碳排放量，这比摩洛哥这样的国家的年排放量还要多。德·弗里斯随后开始追踪比特币挖掘产生的电子废物——每笔交易相当于一部iPhone的价值——以及其水资源使用量——大约是每年两万亿升。
    （这些水用于冷却挖掘中使用的服务器，而电子废物则由已经过时的服务器产生。）
- en: 'Last year, de Vries became concerned about another energy hog: A.I. “I saw
    that it has a similar capability, and also the potential to have a similar growth
    trajectory in the coming years, and I felt immediately prompted to make sure people
    are aware that this is also energy-intensive technology,” he explained. He added
    a new tab to his blog: “AI sustainability.” In a paper he published last fall,
    in *Joule*, a journal devoted to sustainable energy, de Vries, who now works for
    the Netherlands’ central bank, estimated that if Google were to integrate generative
    A.I. into every search, its electricity use would rise to something like twenty-nine
    billion kilowatt-hours per year. This is more than is consumed by many countries,
    including Kenya, Guatemala, and Croatia.'

  zh: 去年，德·弗里斯开始担心另一个能源大户：人工智能（A.I.）。“我发现它具有类似的能力，并且在未来几年可能有类似的增长轨迹，我立即感到需要确保人们意识到这也是一种耗能技术，”他解释道。他在博客上添加了一个新标签：“AI可持续性”。在他去年秋天发表的一篇论文中，在致力于可持续能源的期刊*Joule*上，现在任职于荷兰央行的德·弗里斯估计，如果谷歌将生成式人工智能整合到每次搜索中，其电力消耗将增至大约二十九亿千瓦时每年。这比许多国家，包括肯尼亚、危地马拉和克罗地亚的电力消耗都要多。
- en: “There’s a fundamental mismatch between this technology and environmental sustainability,”
    de Vries said. Recently, the world’s most prominent A.I. cheerleader, Sam Altman,
    the C.E.O. of OpenAI, voiced similar concerns, albeit with a different spin. “I
    think we still don’t appreciate the energy needs of this technology,” Altman said
    at a public appearance in Davos. He didn’t see how these needs could be met, he
    went on, “without a breakthrough.” He added, “We need fusion or we need, like,
    radically cheaper solar plus storage, or something, at massive scale—like, a scale
    that no one is really planning for.”

  zh: '"这项技术与环境可持续性之间存在根本不匹配，"德·弗里斯说。最近，全球最著名的人工智能支持者之一，OpenAI的首席执行官山姆·奥尔特曼在达沃斯的公开场合上发表了类似的担忧，尽管他有所不同。"我认为我们仍然没有意识到这项技术的能源需求，"奥尔特曼在谈到这些需求如何能够满足时说道，"没有突破是不可能的。"他补充道："我们需要核聚变，或者我们需要像太阳能加存储这样的，或者其他的大规模解决方案——像是没有人真正计划的那种规模。"'
- en: 'Last week, the International Energy Agency announced that energy-related global
    CO[2] emissions rose, yet again, in 2023, to more than thirty-seven billion metric
    tons. The increase comes at a time when the whole world is supposedly striving
    to reach net-zero emissions, and it indicates that global efforts are, to put
    it mildly, falling short. Much of the increase in emissions came from China, and
    most of it was driven by century-old technologies, such as the internal-combustion
    engine. So data centers are, for now at least, a small part of the problem. Still,
    as the use of A.I. ramps up and bitcoin prices reach new heights, the question
    is: How can the world reach net zero if it keeps inventing new ways to consume
    energy? (In the U.S., data centers now account for about four per cent of electricity
    consumption, and that figure is expected to climb to six per cent by 2026.)'

  zh: 上周，国际能源署宣布，2023年与能源相关的全球二氧化碳排放再次上升，超过三十七亿公吨。这一增长发生在整个世界据称正在努力实现净零排放的时候，表明全球的努力可以说是不够的。排放增加的大部分来自中国，其中大部分是由于百年技术，比如内燃机。因此，数据中心目前至少在问题中只是一个小部分。尽管如此，随着人工智能的使用增加和比特币价格达到新高，问题是：如果世界继续发明新的能源消耗方式，如何实现净零排放？（在美国，数据中心现在占电力消耗的约四分之一，预计到2026年这一比例将升至六分之一。）
- en: Mining cryptocurrencies like bitcoin eats up electricity owing to the way the
    system was set up. To acquire bitcoin (and other currencies that rely on a similar
    scheme), miners compete to answer cryptographic riddles. Winning the competition
    takes a lot of computing power. As a result, server farms devoted to crypto mining
    tend to be situated in parts of the world where electricity is cheap. China used
    to lead the world in crypto mining, but it imposed a ban on the practice in 2021,
    and now the U.S. is No. 1\. A few months ago, the U.S. Department of Energy tried
    to compel mining concerns to report their energy use, but in February a Texas
    judge issued a temporary restraining order blocking the effort. (According to
    the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, crypto mining in the
    U.S. uses almost as much energy as all the nation’s home computers combined.)
    Meanwhile, the higher the price of bitcoin rises—it reached a record of sixty-nine
    thousand dollars on March 5th—the bigger the financial incentives for mining it,
    and the more energy consumed.

  zh: 挖掘比特币等加密货币由于系统设置的方式而消耗大量电力。为了获取比特币（以及依赖类似方案的其他货币），矿工们竞争解答加密谜题。赢得竞争需要大量计算能力。因此，专用于加密货币挖掘的服务器农场通常设在电力廉价的地区。中国曾在加密货币挖掘方面处于领先地位，但于2021年禁止该实践，现在美国排名第一。几个月前，美国能源部试图强制挖掘企业报告其能源使用情况，但是在二月份，得克萨斯州法官发布了一项临时限制令，阻止了这一努力。（根据白宫科技政策办公室的说法，美国的加密货币挖掘消耗的能源几乎与全国所有家用电脑的能源消耗相当。）与此同时，比特币价格越高——它在3月5日达到了创纪录的69000美元——挖掘它的财务激励越大，消耗的能源也越多。
- en: Artificial intelligence requires a lot of power for much the same reason. The
    kind of machine learning that produced ChatGPT relies on models that process fantastic
    amounts of information, and every bit of processing takes energy. When ChatGPT
    spits out information (or writes someone’s high-school essay), that, too, requires
    a lot of processing. It’s been estimated that ChatGPT is responding to something
    like two hundred million requests per day, and, in so doing, is consuming more
    than half a million kilowatt-hours of electricity. (For comparison’s sake, the
    average U.S. household consumes twenty-nine kilowatt-hours a day.)

- en: A.I. could potentially be used to alleviate some of the problems it is exacerbating.
    For instance, it might be used to improve the efficiency of renewable-energy systems,
    which could reduce emissions from server farms. But it seems unlikely that such
    gains will keep up with A.I.’s growing electricity demands; this, presumably,
    is why Altman argues that a technological breakthrough is needed.

- en: De Vries, for his part, is dismayed by what he sees as a lack of human learning
    in the face of so much machine learning. “I think the only thing that’s realistic
    in terms of policy, at least in the short to medium term, is disclosure requirements,”
    he said. “It’s taken a very long time before we got there with regard to cryptocurrencies,
    and I’m disappointed that we haven’t gotten there sooner with A.I. It’s like we
    saw what cryptocurrency mining could do, and we totally forgot about it.” ♦
