- en: 'In 1868, a little-known writer by the name of John William DeForest proposed
    a new type of literature, a collective artistic project for a nation just emerging
    from an existential conflict: a work of fiction that accomplished “the task of
    painting the American soul.” It would be called the Great American Novel, and
    no one had written it yet, DeForest admitted. Maybe soon.'

  zh: 1868年，一个名叫约翰·威廉·德福雷斯特的鲜为人知的作家提出了一种新型文学，这是一个刚刚从存在危机中崛起的国家的集体艺术项目：一部完成“描绘美国灵魂”任务的小说。它将被称为《伟大的美国小说》，但德福雷斯特承认还没有人写出它。也许很快。
- en: A century and a half later, the idea has endured, even as it has become more
    complicated. In 2024, our definition of literary greatness is wider, deeper, and
    weirder than DeForest likely could have imagined. At the same time, the novel
    is also under threat, as the forces of anti-intellectualism and authoritarianism
    seek to ban books and curtail freedom of expression. The American canon is more
    capacious, more fluid, and more fragile than perhaps ever before. But what, exactly,
    is in it? What follows is our attempt to discover just that.

  zh: 一个半世纪后，这个想法仍然存在，尽管它变得更加复杂。到了2024年，我们对文学伟大的定义比德福雷斯特可能想象的更广泛、更深刻和更奇特。与此同时，小说也面临威胁，反智主义和专制主义力量试图禁书并限制言论自由。美国的经典作品库比以往任何时候都更加宽广、更加流动、也更加脆弱。但究竟是什么在其中？接下来是我们试图发现答案的尝试。
- en: In setting out to identify that new American canon, we decided to define *American*
    as having first been published in the United States (or intended to be—read more
    in our entries on *Lolita* and *The Bell Jar*). And we narrowed our aperture to
    the past 100 years—a period that began as literary modernism was cresting and
    contains all manner of literary pleasure and possibility, including the experimentations
    of postmodernism and the narrative satisfactions of genre fiction.

  zh: 在确定新的美国经典作品库时，我们决定将*美国*定义为首次在美国出版（或有意出版——更多详情请参阅我们关于《洛丽塔》和《玻璃罩》的条目）。我们将我们的兴趣范围缩小到过去100年——一个文学现代主义达到顶峰并包含各种文学快乐和可能性的时期，包括后现代主义的实验和流派小说的叙事满足。
- en: 'This still left millions of potential titles. So we approached experts—scholars,
    critics, and novelists, both at *The Atlantic* and outside it—and asked for their
    suggestions. From there, we added and subtracted and debated and negotiated and
    considered and reconsidered until we landed on the list you’re about to read.
    We didn’t limit ourselves to a round, arbitrary number; we wanted to recognize
    the very best—novels that say something intriguing about the world and do it distinctively,
    in intentional, artful prose—no matter how many or few that ended up being (136,
    as it turns out). Our goal was to single out those classics that stand the test
    of time, but also to make the case for the unexpected, the unfairly forgotten,
    and the recently published works that already feel indelible. We aimed for comprehensiveness,
    rigor, and open-mindedness. Serendipity, too: We hoped to replicate that particular
    joy of a friend pressing a book into your hand and saying, “You have to read this;
    you’ll love it.”'

  zh: 这依然留下了数百万潜在的作品标题。因此，我们向专家——学者、评论家和小说家，无论是在*大西洋*内部还是外部——征求意见。从那里，我们添加、删除、辩论、协商、考虑和重新考虑，直到我们得出您将要阅读的清单。我们没有限制自己在一个固定、任意的数字上；我们想要承认最好的作品——那些用有趣的方式表达世界并以有意识、艺术的散文进行表达的小说——无论最终数量多少（结果是136部）。我们的目标是挑出那些经得起时间考验的经典作品，同时也为意外之作、被遗忘但不应忽视的作品以及那些已经感觉不可磨灭的新作品辩护。我们旨在做到全面、严谨和开放思维。同时也希望偶然性：我们希望重现朋友将一本书推荐给你的那种特殊喜悦，“你一定要读这本书，你会喜欢的。”
- en: 'This list includes 45 debut novels, nine winners of the Pulitzer Prize for
    Fiction, and three children’s books. Twelve were published before the introduction
    of the mass-market paperback to America, and 24 after the release of the Kindle.
    At least 60 have been banned by schools or libraries. Together, they represent
    the best of what novels can do: challenge us, delight us, pull us in and then
    release us, a little smarter and a little more alive than we were before. You
    have to read them.'
