    of the reasons we started it.

  zh: 在我们甚至开始Y Combinator之前，我就认识了Reddit的创始人。事实上，他们是我们开始Y Combinator的原因之一。
- en: 'YC grew out of a talk I gave to the Harvard Computer Society (the undergrad
    computer club) about how to start a startup. Everyone else in the audience was
    probably local, but Steve and Alexis came up on the train from the University
    of Virginia, where they were seniors. Since they''d come so far I agreed to meet
    them for coffee. They told me about the startup idea we''d later fund them to
    drop: a way to order fast food on your cellphone.'

  zh: YC 是我向哈佛大学计算机协会（本科计算机俱乐部）发表的一次演讲的产物，讲述了如何创办一家初创企业。听众中其他人可能都是当地人，但史蒂夫和亚历克西斯从弗吉尼亚大学乘火车来到这里，他们当时是大四学生。因为他们来得这么远，我同意和他们喝咖啡。他们告诉我他们的初创想法后，我们后来资助他们放弃：一种可以在你的手机上订购快餐的方法。
- en: This was before smartphones. They'd have had to make deals with cell carriers
    and fast food chains just to get it launched. So it was not going to happen. It
    still doesn't exist, 19 years later. But I was impressed with their brains and
    their energy. In fact I was so impressed with them and some of the other people
    I met at that talk that I decided to start something to fund them. A few days
    later I told Steve and Alexis that we were starting Y Combinator, and encouraged
    them to apply.

  zh: 那时还没有智能手机。他们必须与手机运营商和快餐连锁店达成协议才能推出这个产品。所以这是不可能的。19年后，它仍然不存在。但是我对他们的智慧和能量印象深刻。事实上，我对他们和我在那次演讲中遇到的其他人印象深刻，于是我决定开始一些事情来资助他们。几天后，我告诉史蒂夫和亚历克西斯我们要开始Y
    Combinator，并鼓励他们申请。
- en: That first batch we didn't have any way to identify applicants, so we made up
    nicknames for them. The Reddits were the "Cell food muffins." "Muffin" is a term
    of endearment Jessica uses for things like small dogs and two year olds. So that
    gives you some idea what kind of impression Steve and Alexis made in those days.
    They had the look of slightly ruffled surprise that baby birds have.

  zh: 在我们的第一批申请者中，我们没有任何方式来识别申请者，所以我们为他们编造了昵称。Reddit被称为“Cell food muffins”。“Muffin”是Jessica用来称呼小狗和两岁小孩之类的亲昵称呼。这给你一些印象，史蒂夫和亚历克西斯在那些日子里给人的印象。他们带有轻微的惊讶神情，就像小鸟宝宝一样。
- en: Their idea was bad though. And since we thought then that we were funding ideas
    rather than founders, we rejected them. But we felt bad about it. Jessica was
    sad that we'd rejected the muffins. And it seemed wrong to me to turn down the
    people we'd been inspired to start YC to fund.

  zh: 但是他们的想法确实很糟糕。因为我们当时认为我们是资助想法而不是创始人，所以我们拒绝了他们。但我们觉得很抱歉。Jessica对我们拒绝“Muffins”感到难过。而对我来说，拒绝我们开始资助的人似乎是错误的。
- en: I don't think the startup sense of the word "pivot" had been invented yet, but
    we wanted to fund Steve and Alexis, so if their idea was bad, they'd have to work
    on something else. And I knew what else. In those days there was a site called
    Delicious where you could save links. It had a page called del.icio.us/popular
    that listed the most-saved links, and people were using this page as a de facto
    Reddit. I knew because a lot of the traffic to my site was coming from it. There
    needed to be something like del.icio.us/popular, but designed for sharing links
    instead of being a byproduct of saving them.

  zh: 我不认为当时创业中“转向”这个词的意思已经被发明出来，但是我们想资助史蒂夫和亚历克西斯，所以如果他们的想法不好，他们必须做其他事情。而我知道有其他事情可以做。那些日子有一个叫Delicious的网站，你可以在那里保存链接。它有一个页面叫做del.icio.us/popular，列出了保存最多链接的页面，人们正是利用这个页面作为一种事实上的Reddit。我知道，因为我的网站的大部分流量都来自于那里。需要有类似于del.icio.us/popular的东西，但设计用于分享链接而不是保存它们的副产品。
- en: So I called Steve and Alexis and said that we liked them, just not their idea,
    so we'd fund them if they'd work on something else. They were on the train home
    to Virginia at that point. They got off at the next station and got on the next
    train north, and by the end of the day were committed to working on what's now
    called Reddit.

  zh: 于是我给史蒂夫和亚历克西斯打电话说，我们喜欢他们，只是不喜欢他们的想法，所以如果他们愿意做其他事情，我们会资助他们。那时他们已经在回弗吉尼亚的火车上了。他们在下一站下车，搭上了北方的下一班火车，到了一天结束时，他们已经决定开始做现在称为Reddit的事情。
- en: They would have liked to call it Snoo, as in "What snoo?" But snoo.com was too
    expensive, so they settled for calling the mascot Snoo and picked a name for the
    site that wasn't registered. Early on Reddit was just a provisional name, or so
    they told me at least, but it's probably too late to change it now.
  id: totrans-split-13
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 他们本想称之为 Snoo，就像“什么是 Snoo？”但 snoo.com 太贵了，所以他们决定将吉祥物称为 Snoo，并选择了一个尚未注册的站点名称。早期的
    Reddit 只是一个临时名称，至少他们告诉我是这样的，但现在可能已经太晚改变了。
- en: As with all the really great startups, there's an uncannily close match between
    the company and the founders. Steve in particular. Reddit has a certain personality
    — curious, skeptical, ready to be amused — and that personality is Steve's.
  id: totrans-split-14
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 和所有真正伟大的初创公司一样，公司和创始人之间有一种不可思议的密切匹配。特别是 Steve。Reddit 有一种特定的个性——好奇、怀疑、愿意被逗乐——而这种个性正是
    Steve 的。
- en: Steve will roll his eyes at this, but he's an intellectual; he's interested
    in ideas for their own sake. That was how he came to be in that audience in Cambridge
    in the first place. He knew me because he was interested in a programming language
    I've written about called Lisp, and Lisp is one of those languages few people
    learn except out of intellectual curiosity. Steve's kind of vacuum-cleaner curiosity
    is exactly what you want when you're starting a site that's a list of links to
    literally anything interesting.
  id: totrans-split-15
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: Steve 对此会翻白眼，但他是一个知识分子；他对思想本身感兴趣。这就是他首次出现在剑桥的那场观众中的原因。他认识我是因为他对我写过的一种编程语言 Lisp
    感兴趣，而 Lisp 是少数人除了出于知识好奇心外几乎没有人学习的语言之一。Steve 这种像吸尘器般的好奇心正是你在创建一个链接到任何有趣事物的网站时所需要的。
- en: Steve was not a big fan of authority, so he also liked the idea of a site without
    editors. In those days the top forum for programmers was a site called Slashdot.
    It was a lot like Reddit, except the stories on the frontpage were chosen by human
    moderators. And though they did a good job, that one small difference turned out
    to be a big difference. Being driven by user submissions meant Reddit was fresher
    than Slashdot. News there was newer, and users will always go where the newest
    news is.
  id: totrans-split-16
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: Steve 不是权威的忠实粉丝，所以他也喜欢没有编辑的网站的想法。在那些日子里，程序员的顶级论坛是一个叫做 Slashdot 的网站。它很像 Reddit，只是前页的故事是由人类管理员选择的。虽然他们做得很好，但那个微小的区别证明是一个大区别。由用户提交驱动意味着
    Reddit 比 Slashdot 更新鲜。新闻更加新颖，用户总是会去最新的新闻。
- en: I pushed the Reddits to launch fast. A version one didn't need to be more than
    a couple hundred lines of code. How could that take more than a week or two to
    build? And they did launch comparatively fast, about three weeks into the first
    YC batch. The first users were Steve, Alexis, me, and some of their YC batchmates
    and college friends. It turns out you don't need that many users to collect a
    decent list of interesting links, especially if you have multiple accounts per
    user.
  id: totrans-split-17
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 我促使 Reddit 快速启动。第一版只需要不超过几百行代码。怎么可能需要花超过一两个星期来构建？他们确实相对快速地推出了，大约在第一个 YC 批次的三周内。最初的用户是
    Steve、Alexis、我和一些他们的 YC 批次同学和大学朋友。事实证明，你不需要太多用户就能收集到一份不错的有趣链接列表，特别是如果每个用户有多个账户。
- en: 'Reddit got two more people from their YC batch: Chris Slowe and Aaron Swartz,
    and they too were unusually smart. Chris was just finishing his PhD in physics
    at Harvard. Aaron was younger, a college freshman, and even more anti-authority
    than Steve. It''s not exaggerating to describe him as a martyr for what authority
    later did to him.'

  zh: Reddit 从他们的 YC 批次中又找到了两个人：Chris Slowe 和 Aaron Swartz，他们也异常聪明。Chris 正在哈佛完成他的物理学博士学位。Aaron
    则更年轻，是一名大一新生，比 Steve 更加反对权威。用他所做的对待他的权威的方式来形容他并不夸张。
- en: Slowly but inexorably Reddit's traffic grew. At first the numbers were so small
    they were hard to distinguish from background noise. But within a few weeks it
    was clear that there was a core of real users returning regularly to the site.
    And although all kinds of things have happened to Reddit the company in the years
    since, Reddit the *site* never looked back.

  zh: Reddit 的流量逐渐但不可避免地增长。起初，数字如此之小，几乎难以与背景噪音区分。但几周后，很明显有一群真正的用户定期回访该网站。尽管多年来 Reddit
    公司发生了各种各样的事情，Reddit 这个*网站*却从未回头看。
- en: Reddit the site (and now app) is such a fundamentally useful thing that it's
    almost unkillable. Which is why, despite a long stretch after Steve left when
    the management strategy ranged from benign neglect to spectacular blunders, traffic
    just kept growing. You can't do that with most companies. Most companies you take
    your eye off the ball for six months and you're in deep trouble. But Reddit was
    special, and when Steve came back in 2015, I knew the world was in for a surprise.
  id: totrans-split-20

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: Reddit 这个网站（现在又是一个应用程序）是如此基础而实用，几乎不可能被击败。这就是为什么尽管 Steve 离开后的长期时期，管理策略从温和的忽视到惊人的失误不一而足，流量仍然在不断增长的原因。大多数公司做不到这一点。对于大多数公司来说，你把目光从核心业务上移开六个月，就会陷入深深的困境。但
    Reddit 是特别的，所以当 Steve 在2015年回来时，我知道世界将会大吃一惊。
- en: 'People thought they had Reddit''s number: one of the players in Silicon Valley,
    but not one of the big ones. But those who knew what had been going on behind
    the scenes knew there was more to the story than this. If Reddit could grow to
    the size it had with management that was harmless at best, what could it do if
    Steve came back? We now know the answer to that question. Or at least a lower
    bound on the answer. Steve is not out of ideas yet.'

  zh: 人们以为他们已经掌握了 Reddit 的套路：它是硅谷的玩家之一，但不是大公司之一。但那些知道幕后真相的人知道，事情并不仅如此。如果 Reddit 能在最多算是无害的管理下增长到目前这样的规模，如果
    Steve 回来会怎样呢？我们现在知道这个问题的答案。或者至少可以算是答案的一个下限。Steve 还没有耗尽创意。
