    if an edible big game animal — like a moose, caribou or buffalo — is killed in
    defense of life or property, the musher is required to gut the animal and report
    it to race officials at the next checkpoint. Mushers who follow must help gut
    the animal when possible and no teams may pass until the animal is gutted and
    the musher gutting the animal has proceeded. Any other animal killed in defense
    of life or property must be reported to a race official but is not required to
    be gutted.
