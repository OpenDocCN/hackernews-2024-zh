- en: 'It’s the start of a new school year. A thirteen-year-old boy with an ill-fitting
    blazer and a fuzzy top lip shuffles into my first philosophy class of the term.
    He has messy black hair and big, dark eyes. He’s by far the shortest in the class.
    Eyes down, he makes his way to a front desk without any attempt at human interaction.
    A nervous air hangs over him. Teenagers quickly pick up on oddballs, and I wonder,
    as he glides through like a ghost, if they already intuit that this boy is strange.
    Under his arm is a tattered book, the size catches my eye. This isn’t an academically
    selective school — my expectation is smartphones, not tomes. He takes a seat and
    places the book face down on the desk. I twist my neck to see its spine, then
    I begin with the usual question: what is philosophy? His hand shoots up: “The
    etymology is from the Greek *philos*, meaning love, and *sophos*, meaning wisdom,
    so *love of wisdom*.” In this first lesson, the boy will — literally squeaking
    with enthusiasm — raise his hand for every question. He does that thing eager
    kids do where they hover slightly above their chair, almost hyperextend their
    arm, and stare at you until you either relent or ask someone else. The boy''s
    name is Georgios. A few weeks later, he will have locked himself in the bathroom.
    He will be crying and unable to say why.'

  zh: 一个新学年的开始。一个穿着不合身的西装和一撇模糊的小胡子的十三岁男孩蹒跚走进了我这学期的第一堂哲学课。他凌乱的黑发和大大的深邃眼睛。他在班上绝对是个个子最矮的。他的眼睛朝下看，毫无人类互动的意愿地走向前排的一张桌子。他身上笼罩着一种紧张的氛围。青少年很快就能察觉到怪人，我想，当他像鬼魅一样悄无声息地穿过时，他们是否已经直觉到这个男孩很奇怪。他的胳膊下夹着一本破旧的书，书的大小引起了我的注意。这不是一所学术选择性很高的学校
    — 我期待的是智能手机，而不是厚厚的书。他坐下来，把书脸朝下放在桌子上。我扭头看了看书脊，然后开始问通常的问题：哲学是什么？他的手一挥而上：“词源来自希腊语*philos*，意思是爱，和*sophos*，意思是智慧，所以*爱智慧*。”在这堂第一课上，这个男孩会
    — 真的兴奋得发出尖叫声 — 对每个问题都举手。他像急切的孩子一样做着一件事，他们把自己的椅子稍微抬起，几乎过度伸展了手臂，盯着你看，直到你要么放弃，要么问其他人。这个男孩的名字叫乔治奥斯。几周后，他会把自己锁在浴室里。他会哭，却无法说出原因。
- en: In the first term, I taught the Socratic method. Asking young people to consider
    contradictions in their thought is always a tightrope walk. Doing it with Georgios
    in the class was like teaching basic algebra with an undergraduate mathematician
    stewing in the corner. Many children in his position switch off, but Georgios
    was constituted differently. He wanted to teach his classmates and had enough
    self-restraint to calm down when I told him to let others speak. But his explanations
    were dense. A discussion on whether it’s ever acceptable to lie would quickly
    turn into Georgios waxing lyrical about moral philosophy — “The fatal flaw, as
    I understand it, in Kant’s deontological ethical system is his disregard of consequentialism.”

    UK’s only psychologist specialising in gifted children, Joan Freeman. She had
    written a book a few years prior called *Gifted Lives: What Happens when Gifted
    Children Grow Up*. Freeman had followed gifted children for decades through adulthood
    and the world of work, charting their successes and failures along the way. She
    was meticulous. Moreover, her monopoly on the market had clearly made for a lucrative
    career. Georgios recalled going to her grand Georgian home tucked away in a garden
    square in Marylebone, where Anthony Trollope and Ted Hughes had once lived. It
    was there that she also worked, assessing and counselling clients. Georgios spent
    the afternoon solving puzzles and answering questions. Freeman summarised her
    findings over four A4 pages. Regarding Georgios’ verbal ability, she noted:'

  zh: 在我遇到乔治欧斯的一年前，他曾接受过英国唯一专门研究天才儿童的心理学家琼·弗里曼的专业智商测试。她几年前写了一本书，名为《天才的生活：当天才儿童长大后会发生什么》。弗里曼几十年来一直跟踪天才儿童的成长和职场生涯，记录他们的成功和失败。她非常细致。此外，她对市场的垄断显然让她的职业生涯非常有利可图。乔治欧斯回忆起他曾经去过她位于玛丽尔本花园广场的大乔治式住宅，在那里安东尼·特罗洛普和泰德·休斯曾经居住过。在那里，她也在工作，评估和辅导客户。乔治欧斯花了一个下午时间解决难题和回答问题。弗里曼在四张A4纸上总结了她的研究结果。关于乔治欧斯的语言能力，她注意到：

    task for gifted children generally, but especially for those with Asperger’s,
    the high-functioning form of autism. Take Georgios’ passion as an example. Aristotle
    wrote about the idea of the golden mean, where every virtue harmoniously rests
    between two vices: deficiency versus excess. A deficiency of enthusiasm we know
    as apathy, but I’m unsure whether English has a word for *excessive* enthusiasm—at
    least the all-consuming, uncompromising type Georgios demonstrated. Whenever a
    fellow student hesitated or gave the wrong answer, he would flick his hands in
    short, staccato movements, declaring, “no, no, nooo!”. Not loudly, but loud enough
    for everybody to hear and for awkwardness, as well as muffled laughter at Georgios’
    expense, to ensue.'

- en: 'Fast forward several years, and I learned that there was indeed a word for
    excess enthusiasm, except it was Polish. In 1962, Kazimierz Dąbrowski, an esteemed
    Polish psychologist and psychiatrist, conducted neurological examinations of eighty
    creatively gifted young people aged 8-23\. Thirty were intellectually gifted and
    fifty were talented, coming from leading drama, ballet, or art schools. Every
    single one of them displayed *nadpobudliwosc*, apparently poorly translated to
    English as ‘overexcitability’. Dabrowski described overexcitable people as: ‘delicate,
    gentle, sensitive, empathic, nonaggressive, industrious, wise though unsophisticated,
    never brutal, often inhibited, likely to withdraw into themselves rather than
    retaliate, having deep feelings, idealistic’. This was Georgios.'

  zh: 几年过去了，我发现确实有一个词来描述过度热情，只不过它是波兰的。1962年，受人尊敬的波兰心理学家和精神科医生卡日米日·达布罗夫斯基对80名有创造力的年轻人进行了神经学检查，年龄在8至23岁之间。其中30人智力过人，50人有才华，来自领先的戏剧、芭蕾舞或艺术学校。他们每个人都表现出*nadpobudliwosc*，似乎被翻译成英语为‘过度兴奋’。达布罗夫斯基将过度兴奋的人描述为：‘细腻、温柔、敏感、有同理心、不具侵略性、勤奋、虽然不成熟但智慧，从不野蛮，通常受抑制，更倾向于退缩而不是报复，有深厚的感情，理想主义者’。这就是乔治。

    There was a five-minute window between morning classes. After every lesson, Georgios
    would scuttle up to my desk to release an intellectual pressure valve, saying
    everything he hadn’t been able to in the lesson. He rattled off these pent-up
    observations until the bell rang. Then, with a slight bow of the head, he’d say,
    “Very well, thank you, sir”, before running off. Is it possible for a run to look
    anxious? At break and lunch, I would return to my classroom to find him either
    browsing the books on my shelf or reading the wall display of a hundred philosophers
    from antiquity to the present. I scrambled to accommodate his interests as best
    as possible, but it quickly became clear that an extra worksheet or two wouldn’t

  zh: 他那个第一天早晨带着的书是一本柏拉图对话集。早上课间有五分钟的时间。每节课之后，乔治都会急忙来到我的课桌前释放他的智力压力阀，说出他在课堂上无法表达的一切。他喋喋不休地说出这些压抑的观察，直到铃声响起。然后，微微点头，他会说，“非常好，谢谢，先生”，然后跑开。奔跑看起来会焦虑吗？休息和午餐时，我会回到我的教室，发现他要么在浏览我的书架上的书籍，要么在阅读从古代到现在的一百位哲学家的墙上展示。我竭尽所能地满足他的兴趣，但很快就明显地看出，再多几份练习也不够。他需要亚里士多德著名给予亚历山大大帝的一对一辅导。乔安·弗里曼也意识到了同样的问题：
- en: His young mind is constantly searching for more stimulation and knowledge. He
    really needs an enriched and stimulating education. And he needs it all the time,

    (there were several, including two in the Netherlands). In fact, he’d found the

    raised his hand again. His mother would later tell me that it took a long time

- en: 'Outside class, I walked with Georgios to the sports field twice a week, twenty
    minutes each way. There too we also spoke about philosophy. As we left the school
    in a long line of pairs, Georgios would wait until I took my place at the back
    to furtively tag on. Sometimes he would wait a few seconds before speaking, but
    there was never any small talk. A few of the opening lines I remember: *I wanted
    to speak to you about a new idea*, *I wanted to get your advice about a detective
    novel I’m writing*, *have you ever read* [insert a classic work]? Several teachers
    told me, “I don’t know how you do it!” By which they meant tolerating Georgios’
    odd behaviour. The truth though is that I didn’t always*do*  *it*. Much of the
    time, Georgios'' clinginess was as irritating to me as it was to them. If I wanted
    to speak to some other students on the walk to sports, for example, it proved

    [插入一个经典作品] *吗*？一些老师告诉我，“我不知道你是怎么做到的！”他们的意思是容忍乔治奥斯的奇怪行为。然而，事实是，我并不总是*做到*这一点。大部分时间，乔治奥斯的依赖性对我和他们一样令人恼火。例如，如果我想在去运动场的路上和其他学生交谈，那就很难不伤害到他的感情。
- en: Eventually, other teachers forced him to walk with the students. They told him
    that he needed to be with people his own age, to which he indignantly replied,
    “but the children, look at them!” gesturing ahead as if they were a herd of sheep.
    “They’re your age, Georgios, they’re not ‘the children’”, came the teacher’s reply.
    Later, when I read Joan Freeman’s assessment, I discovered Georgios had an IQ
    of 145, a score in the top 1.33% for the test he took. Put simply, that meant
    that he was several “mental years” ahead of his peers. If a teacher taught fifty
    students a year for forty years, they would only meet two or three children with
    his raw ability. Moreover, the test Freeman had administered did not measure the
    *quality* of the child’s responses, simply whether they got the right answer.
    Freeman noted, however, that Georgios' answers showed ‘a high level of quality.’

    found his way back to me, slyly slowing his walk until he’d rejoined the back
    of the line). I didn’t mind occasionally speaking with him about philosophy and
    his inchoate ideas, but the boy didn’t have an off switch. He was incessant, robotically
    rambling from one rumination to the next without any intermission. I suddenly

    of sorts, floating adrift in a sea of precocious and comically serious conversation.
    Freeman had said something similar in her report: ‘I found Georgios to be quite
    serious and deserving of respect, if perhaps a little too serious.’ I would find
    out later that he was starved for intellectual stimulation at home, too. And so
    our conversation must’ve been like a supply drop of high-energy rations during
    an interminable war, a short reprieve from the daily failure to find a similar

    in the wrong place. Every so often, there’s a news story about a prodigy *with
    an IQ greater than Einstein’s and Stephen Hawking’s*, despite the inconvenient
    fact that neither ever took an IQ test. A quick Google News search at the time
    of writing shows that this exact headline has been written a depressing number
    of times in the last few years alone. Yet we rarely get any follow-up on these
    prodigies, we just assume that such talent will find a home as water finds a level.
    Perhaps a few of us are aware that these children sometimes burn out and choose
    to stop dancing, painting, coding, or doing philosophy to live a more normal life.But
    gifted children’s stories are much messier than this simple narrative.

    a precocious mind. I pointed to Georgios' prodigious reading and articulacy, I
    spoke about his immense philosophical talent and knowledge, but nothing ever cut
    through. At lunch, Georgios would unsubtly eavesdrop on the teachers’ conversations,
    craning his neck to catch a crumb of half-stimulating dialogue. But instead of
    an invitation to join, he was reprimanded for “being rude”. Interestingly, Joan

    his son Andrew was born, it was clear to Asdrubal that his child was different.
    “When he was 9 years old, he was having trouble at school. He was smarter than
    the other kids, would often correct his teachers and suffered from boredom and
    bullying”, Asdrubal told a journalist. So he decided to set up the Talent Attention
    Centre (CEDAT are the Spanish initials). The foundation now works closely with
    over three hundred children who partake in advanced classes in robotics, physics,
    astronomy, and much more. CEDAT also work to change the perception of giftedness
    and support often ill-informed parents struggling to cope with the needs of their
    highly intelligent children. After receiving eight degrees, including from Harvard

    has even developed an educational model for highly gifted students. CEDAT is the
    largest gifted centre of its kind in Latin America, yet Dafne Almazán, who also
    works at the foundation, wants to go further. “I see it as a social duty to my
    country to help its talent to thrive. I have a goal of creating an adequate education
    option for gifted students whose special abilities need differentiated attention”.
