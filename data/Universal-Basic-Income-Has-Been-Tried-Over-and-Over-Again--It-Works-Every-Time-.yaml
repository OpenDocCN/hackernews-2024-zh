- en: Richard Nixon launched [a UBI program](https://jacobin.com/2016/05/richard-nixon-ubi-basic-income-welfare/)
    in 1969 that was tested on a small number of communities. The program was designed
    to deliver an ongoing, unconditional payment to working families to assist them
    with their basic needs. Hilariously, one of the people put in charge of these
    pilots [was Donald Rumsfeld](https://qz.com/931291/dick-cheney-and-donald-rumsfeld-ran-a-universal-basic-income-experiment-for-president-richard-nixon),
    who was working in Nixon’s Office of Economic Opportunity at the time. Rumsfeld
    also brought on Dick Cheney to help him with the program (later, of course, the
    duo [would go on to disastrously run](https://www.theonion.com/what-i-got-right-about-the-iraq-war-1850249194)
    Bush II’s White House foreign policy team and embroil America in pointless wars).

  zh: 理查德·尼克松于1969年启动了一个[UBI计划](https://jacobin.com/2016/05/richard-nixon-ubi-basic-income-welfare/)，在少数社区进行了测试。该计划旨在为工薪家庭提供持续的、无条件的支付，以帮助他们满足基本需求。令人捧腹的是，其中一位负责这些试点项目的人员是[唐纳德·拉姆斯菲尔德](https://qz.com/931291/dick-cheney-and-donald-rumsfeld-ran-a-universal-basic-income-experiment-for-president-richard-nixon)，他当时在尼克松的经济机会办公室工作。拉姆斯菲尔德还邀请迪克·切尼帮助他管理这个项目（后来，这对组合当然还[灾难性地管理](https://www.theonion.com/what-i-got-right-about-the-iraq-war-1850249194)了布什二世的白宫外交政策团队，并使美国卷入毫无意义的战争）。

    borne out in the project’s findings](https://thecorrespondent.com/4503/the-bizarre-tale-of-president-nixon-and-his-basic-income-bill/173117835-c34d6145):
    “The ‘laziness’ contention is just not supported by our findings,” the chief data
    analyst of one of the experiments said. “There is not anywhere near the mass defection
    the prophets of doom predicted.”'

- en: Due to their success, Nixon’s experiments evolved into broader plans to institute
    a national UBI that would have delivered [as much as $1600 a year](https://jacobin.com/2016/05/richard-nixon-ubi-basic-income-welfare/)
    to families of four (adjusted for inflation, that’s around $10,000 per family).
    This was known as the Family Assistance Plan, or FAP, which would’ve used something
    called a [negative income tax](https://mitsloan.mit.edu/ideas-made-to-matter/negative-income-tax-explained)
    to fund the massive new welfare program. Nixon actually introduced comprehensive
    legislation to institute the program but it was thwarted by political headwinds.
    The program was eventually canceled. Nixon’s advisors, including, [allegedly,
    Milton Friedman](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/feb/27/how-nixon-was-dissuaded-from-introducing-a-universal-basic-income),
    convinced him not to do it.

  zh: 由于其成功，尼克松的试验演变成了更广泛的计划，即实施一个国家UBI计划，该计划将向四口之家提供[每年高达1600美元](https://jacobin.com/2016/05/richard-nixon-ubi-basic-income-welfare/)（根据通货膨胀调整，这大约是每个家庭10000美元）。这被称为家庭援助计划（FAP），该计划本来会使用所谓的[负收入税](https://mitsloan.mit.edu/ideas-made-to-matter/negative-income-tax-explained)来资助这个庞大的新福利计划。尼克松实际上提出了全面立法以实施该计划，但由于政治风波而未能成功。最终该计划被取消。尼克松的顾问们，包括[据称的弥尔顿·弗里德曼](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/feb/27/how-nixon-was-dissuaded-from-introducing-a-universal-basic-income)，说服他不要这么做。
