    job. He refreshes his resume and searches online for “data science jobs Chicago,”
    trawling through four or five job aggregator sites ranging from somewhat legitimate
    to completely illegitimate. He collects about a dozen jobs that could match his
    skill set, more or less, and he applies. Their “easy apply” online systems make
    sending applications relatively painless. They mostly ask him to type out his
    resume, again and again, in the flattest and most generic way possible. But he
    doesn’t hear back from any of the jobs he’s applied for. He is running out of
    money. He sends dozens more applications for jobs over the next several weeks.
    Maybe even 100\. He hears back from two companies. They are both obvious scams.

  zh: 我称之为“应用饱和循环”。我的朋友需要一份新的数据分析工作。他刷新简历，搜索“芝加哥数据科学工作”，在四五个工作聚合网站上浏览，从有些合法到完全不合法不一而足。他大约收集了十多个与他技能匹配的工作岗位，或多或少，然后申请。他们的“轻松申请”在线系统使得发送申请相对轻松。他们大多要求他以最平淡和最普通的方式一遍又一遍地输入他的简历。但是，他没有收到任何申请的回音。他的钱快用完了。在接下来的几个星期里，他又为数十个工作岗位发送了更多的申请。也许甚至有100个。他从两家公司那里得到了回复。它们都是明显的骗局。

    whirring, it sends her five applications, deemed the “best” (By what metric?).
    My friend’s resume was not selected, but perhaps it will be by another hiring
    manager. Until then, his fate – his ability to pay rent and, crucially, cover
    our next round of Miller High Lifes – will be largely determined by job search

    ask him for as many “[sample assignments](https://www.buzzfeed.com/daniellaflores/handling-free-work-requests-job-interviews)”

    year. Job aggregator sites encourage candidates to send buckets of generalist
    applications against the interests of hiring managers who receive an overwhelming
    number of applications that they cannot distinguish from one another. Job postings
    are somehow everywhere but hiring managers complain they can’t find any qualified
    candidates. Layoffs at prestige firms are announced left and right as companies
    pivot away from the pandemic’s free-stimulus-money-for-everyone era (it *probably*
    isn’t indicating an imminent recession, despite what [r/layoffs](https://www.reddit.com/r/Layoffs/)
    would have you believe). To me, concern feels like it’s growing everywhere except
    the cover of the *New York Times*. In fact, a recent survey of 1,500 job candidates
    by the staffing firm Aerotek found [70% of people](https://www.aerotek.com/en/about-us/news-and-events/news/2023/12/aerotek-fall-job-seeker-survey-job-seekers-say-job-hunt-more-difficult)

  zh: 如果有更好的模式适合候选人，那可能就是申请更少但更具体的工作（但仍然偶尔愿意冒一些风险！）。接受你将会适用于较少职位，但对于那些你合适的职位来说，将会成为更大的价值增加，似乎是更好的时间分配。对于雇主来说，情况要复杂一些。重新塑造我们求职的方式意味着可能会公布更严格的“候选人要求”来限制申请者，但不要太严格以至于显著减少你的招聘池的多样性。我们还应该朝着一种文化规范努力，即除非认为他们是职位的非常严肃的竞争者，并且他们的工作得到了公平的报酬，否则不应该将工作交给候选人。要求某人为你做一天的无薪劳动不仅仅是“信息性的”，它也是剥削性的。
- en: As we continue to barrel into an uncertain economic future (don’t forget it’s
    an election year!), it’s critical to consider how the current structure of our
    jobs market impacts those who are the least connected. Our attempts to bring universal
    access and universal candidacy may have backfired somewhat by adding layers of
    complication to people who just want to be considered for roles and compensated
    for their labor. But only once we acknowledge these challenges can we start to
    address them.

  zh: 在我们继续迈向不确定的经济未来（别忘了今年是选举年！），至关重要的是考虑当前的就业市场结构如何影响那些联系最少的人群。我们试图实现普遍访问和普遍候选资格的努力可能在一定程度上适得其反，给那些只想被考虑并为他们的劳动获得报酬的人增加了复杂性。但只有在我们承认这些挑战后，我们才能开始解决它们。

    candidates by analyzing public data that serve as proof of candidates’ claims.
    Professional networks like LinkedIn, Meetup, AngelList, Github, and others can
    be checked for work experience and portfolios. Social media, including Facebook
    and Twitter, also serve as evidence to show that applicants are who they say they
    are.” Well, do you think it’s helping your candidacy?*'
