    at their infancy, and Unix had been invented; the C programming language was born;
    major advances in Physics took place after Einstein; Philip K Dick produced his
    best work; the Space Age had begun; we used to dream of a StarFleet, as Star Trek
    was being televised. In summary, a lot of foundational work was done, and we were
    optimistic about solving hard problems in the future. Fast forward to 2024: space
    exploration has been abandoned, all progress in Physics has halted, best-selling
    books are AI-generated trash, there is one viable open-source OS kernel capable
    of powering computers, one semi-viable systems programming language has been invented,
    and perhaps the most egregious of them all: instead of dreaming of StarFleet,
    we''re consuming tons of compute power to build bullshit-spewing chatbots, and
    for some reason, an overwhelming majority of all industry and academia in Computer
    Science is focused on this dream.'

  zh: 根据大多数人的说法，我会说60年代和70年代是一个好时代：计算机处于萌芽阶段，Unix 已经发明了；C 编程语言诞生了；爱因斯坦之后物理学方面取得了重大进展；菲利普·K·迪克创作了他的杰作；太空时代已经开始；我们过去常常梦想着星际舰队，因为《星际迷航》正在电视上播放。总之，做了很多基础工作，我们对未来解决难题充满了乐观。快进到2024年：太空探索已经被放弃，物理学的所有进展都已停滞不前，畅销书都是人工智能生成的垃圾，有一个可行的开源操作系统内核可以驱动计算机，一个半可行的系统编程语言已经被发明了，而最严重的是：我们不再梦想星际舰队，而是消耗大量的计算资源来建造说废话的聊天机器人，而且出于某种原因，计算机科学领域的工业和学术界绝大多数都集中在这个梦想上。
- en: 'What is to blame for this regression? Some might argue that it''s because the
    American empire is decaying, and like in the 60s and 70s, an overwhelming majority
    of advances originate in the US. Others might argue that Computer Science has
    eaten every other discipline for lunch, and because programming is so accessible
    now, we''re picking low-hanging fruit as a society. While I find both these lines
    of reasoning plausible, there is no doubt that our dreams aren''t far-reaching
    anymore. Take, for instance, our farthest-reaching dream today: self-driving,
    which is really a non-problem, as public transit has existed for decades in all
    major European countries. This is glossing over the fact that it can''t really
    be solved, at least not in any reasonable time frame.'

  zh: 是什么导致了这种倒退呢？有人可能会认为这是因为美国帝国正在衰落，就像在60年代和70年代一样，绝大多数进步都源于美国。其他人可能会认为计算机科学已经吞噬了其他所有学科，因为编程现在是如此容易，我们作为一个社会正在摘取低
    hanging 的果实。虽然我认为这两种推理都是有道理的，但毫无疑问，我们的梦想不再遥不可及。举个例子，我们今天最远大的梦想是自动驾驶，这实际上是一个非问题，因为在所有主要欧洲国家，公共交通已经存在几十年了。这忽略了一个事实，即它实际上不能被解决，至少在任何合理的时间范围内都不能。
- en: A topic often discussed in Star Trek is how human society transcended its societal
    problems to finally have the leisure to innovate and conquer space. It's 2024,
    and no major societal changes seem to be on the horizon. The European Union was
    a major landmark, but it looks like more and more countries are breaking away.
    Universal Basic Income has been debated at length, but no country seems to have
    implemented it to date. All artistic output needs to be commercialized in some
    way, and this is an unsustainable model, as evidenced by struggling artists being
    ripped off by large corporations. There is one major non-commercial entity on
    the internet making encyclopedic information available freely, and another for
    making research available freely. Both have high operating costs, and time will
    tell if donations will be enough to support them. No advances in political science
    or economics have taken place.

  zh: 在《星际迷航》中经常讨论的一个主题是人类社会如何超越其社会问题，最终有了闲暇创新并征服太空。现在是2024年，但在可预见的未来似乎没有重大的社会变革。欧盟是一个重要的里程碑，但看起来越来越多的国家正在分裂。普遍基本收入已经被广泛讨论，但到目前为止没有一个国家实施它。所有的艺术作品都需要以某种方式商业化，这是一个不可持续的模式，因为饱受困扰的艺术家被大型企业剥削的事实证明了这一点。互联网上有一个主要的非商业实体免费提供百科信息，另一个则免费提供研究资料。这两者都有很高的运营成本，时间会告诉我们捐款是否足以支持它们。在政治科学或经济学方面没有取得任何进展。
- en: In short, we seem to be "stuck", as many countries have given up, and are trying
    to ape the American model in some form. A privatization of essential services,
    lax regulation, low taxation, and high inequality. There is no evidence to suggest
    that these policies will lead to innovation, discounting the fact that it certainly
    leads to poor societal well-being. In fact, the "success" of the American model
    can be traced back several decades, to the historical government-funding of Bell
    Labs, several national labs, and institutes of higher education.

  zh: 简而言之，我们似乎“陷入困境”，因为许多国家已经放弃，试图以某种形式模仿美国模式。私有化基本服务、放松监管、低税收和高不平等。没有证据表明这些政策会导致创新，而且它确实会导致社会福祉不佳。事实上，美国模式的“成功”可以追溯到几十年前，即历史上政府资助的贝尔实验室、几个国家实验室和高等教育机构。
- en: 'History has taught us that every empire has a finite lifetime. It starts out
    with strong founders with founding ideals, has a golden age, and a period of decline
    before it collapses. The American empire isn''t any different: it is well past
    its golden age, and is in a period of decline. Perhaps our next window of major
    advances will only come after the American empire has collapsed, and the next
    empire enters its golden age. For the time being, however, the entire world is
    stuck in a mindless chatbot-building exercise.'

  zh: 历史告诉我们，每个帝国都有一个有限的寿命。它始于有着创始理想的坚强创始人，有一个黄金时代，然后是一个衰落期，最后崩溃。美国帝国并不例外：它早已过了黄金时代，正处于衰落期。也许我们下一次重大进步的窗口只会在美国帝国崩溃后出现，下一个帝国进入黄金时代。然而，目前，整个世界都陷入了无意识的聊天机器人构建练习中。
