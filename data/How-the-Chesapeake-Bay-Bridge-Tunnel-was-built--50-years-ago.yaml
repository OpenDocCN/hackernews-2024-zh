  zh: 任何建筑工地都充满危险，但在涌浪和海流中建设需要一种独特的警觉和胆识。
- en: Transfers between boats, barges and the growing bridge presented a frequent
    danger. Captains could not always nose their crafts neatly against ladders, so
    workers often had to jump from a rocking boat or land on one, the surfaces slippery
    from sea spray and, in the winter, ice.

  zh: 在船只、驳船和不断增加的桥梁之间的转移常常是危险的。船长们并不总能将他们的船只整齐地靠近梯子，因此工人们经常不得不从晃动的船上跳下，或者落到一个上面，表面滑溜溜的，冬天时还可能是冰面。
- en: In rough weather, the men tried to leap from the boat when the bow was at its
    highest point. Jumping too soon put them at risk of getting smacked by the craft

- en: At the front of the rig, workers cut off uneven portions of the pilings that
    had been placed ahead of it. The soil at the bottom of the bay varied in firmness,
    and not every pile could be driven to the same depth. Some went so deep that they
    didn't stick far enough out of the water. Those needed another section of piling
    to bring them to the correct height.

  zh: 在装置前端，工人们削掉先行安装的桩子不平整的部分。海湾底部的土壤硬度不均，因此并非所有的桩子都能打到相同的深度。有些桩子打得很深，没有露出足够的水面。这些需要额外的桩子来调整高度。
- en: On the Monster's back end, a crane lifted a rectangular concrete block off a
    barge and lowered it over the pilings behind. More concrete was poured to secure
    it. When capped, each set of three pilings, called a bent, looked like a Stonehenge
    monument sticking out of the water. Another rig followed, setting slabs of concrete
    roadway - more than 3,400 in all - over the supports.

  zh: 在怪物的后端，一台起重机从驳船上吊起一个矩形混凝土块，并将其安置在后方的桩子上。更多的混凝土被倒入以固定它。每组三根桩子，称为一个支架，当盖上时，看起来像是石阵纪念碑从水中伸出。接着另一台装置跟随，将超过3400块混凝土路面板安置在支撑上。

    weathered hands that looked like a blacksmith's.
