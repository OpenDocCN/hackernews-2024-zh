- en: Inflation has been in the news a lot lately. Recently, it has always been in
    the context that inflation is too high. From eggs to rent prices, everything is
    going up, and whenever someone talks about inflation, lower is always better.
    However, as many know, the Federal Reserve, the central bank for the United States,
    has had a de facto target rate of inflation at 2% and an official target rate
    ever since 2012\. So why does the Fed want some level of inflation? Why should
    the target not be 0%? After all, no one likes it when prices rise, so why not
    1%? Why not negative inflation or deflation? Is there a reason for 2%?

  zh: 最近，通货膨胀一直是新闻头条。最近，它总是在通货膨胀过高的背景下被提及。从鸡蛋到租金，所有东西的价格都在上涨，每当有人谈论通货膨胀时，较低总是更好。然而，众所周知，美联储，即美国的中央银行，自2012年以来，其实际通货膨胀目标率为2%，并有一个官方通货膨胀目标率。那么，为什么美联储希望保持某一水平的通货膨胀？为什么目标不是0%？毕竟，没有人喜欢物价上涨，那为什么不是1%？为什么不是负通货膨胀或通缩？2%的原因是什么？
- en: The story of the 2% inflation target starts oddly in New Zealand. In 1989, New
    Zealand wanted to codify the independence of its central bank, and in this bill,
    it directed the New Zealand finance minister and head of its central bank to come
    up with an inflation target (Irwin 2014). If this target was not met, then the
    head of the central bank could be fired. According to David Caygill, New Zealand’s
    finance minister at the time, “Inflation targeting wasn’t from our point of view
    the main point of the act,” and establishing the bank’s independence from political
    processes was far more important (Irwin, 2014). There were some concerns that
    a target would lead to higher employment, but the main opposition to the inflation
    target was in the hospital at the time. Once the bill became law, then an inflation
    target had to be chosen. In an off-hand remark in an interview, the former head
    central banker said the inflation target should be zero to 1 percent. However,
    Don Brash, the head of the central bank, claimed “It was almost a chance remark,”
    and “The figure was plucked out of the air to influence the public’s expectations
    ”(Irwin, 2014). They used this number as a starting point and pushed it up to
    2% to give themselves a bit more room.

  zh: 2%通货膨胀目标的故事起源于新西兰的一个奇怪事件。1989年，新西兰希望将其央行的独立性法律化，在这项法案中，它指示新西兰财政部长和央行行长制定一个通货膨胀目标（Irwin,
    2014）。如果未能达到此目标，则央行行长可能会被解雇。据当时的新西兰财政部长大卫·凯吉尔称，“从我们的角度来看，通胀目标并不是法案的主要要点”，建立银行独立于政治过程之外的地位远比此重要（Irwin,
    2014）。一些人担心目标会导致更高的就业率，但主要的反对通货膨胀目标的声音出现在当时的医院。法案通过后，就必须选择一个通货膨胀目标。在一次采访中，前央行行长在一个副手说的话中提到，通货膨胀目标应该是0到1%。然而，央行行长唐·布拉什声称，“这几乎是一句偶然的谈话”，“这个数字是为了影响公众的预期而被随意提出的”（Irwin,
    2014）。他们以此作为起点，将目标提高到2%以便留有更多余地。
- en: One could easily believe that an arbitrary number based on lack of political
    opposition and an off-hand comment by a central banker would not have much effect,
    but that assumption would be wrong. Once the central bank said that inflation
    would be 2%, everyone else assumed that it would be too, since the central bank
    could use monetary policy to change the inflation rate. For example, contracts
    assumed a 2% inflation rate, which means wages would only rise 2% a year. This
    meant that costs only would have to rise 2%, meaning that inflation slowed. It
    also got rid of the inflationary cycle where one buys goods now since they now
    believe they will be much more expensive later, creating a shortage of goods and
    an increase in prices. In 1989, the inflation rate was 7.6% in New Zealand, and
    by 1991 it was 2%. Countries started to take notice, and Canada and Britain implemented
    inflation targets shortly after (Irwin,2014).

  zh: 有些人可能会认为，根据政治反对的缺乏以及央行行长的一句随意评论得出的任意数字不会产生太大影响，但这种假设是错误的。一旦央行表示通胀率将为2%，其他所有人也假定通胀率将是2%，因为央行可以利用货币政策来改变通胀率。例如，合同假设通胀率为2%，这意味着工资每年只会上涨2%。这意味着成本只需要上涨2%，从而减缓了通货膨胀。这也消除了通货膨胀周期，其中一个原因是人们现在购买商品，因为他们认为将来商品会更加昂贵，这造成了商品短缺和价格上涨。1989年，新西兰的通胀率为7.6%，到1991年降至2%。其他国家开始关注，加拿大和英国随后实施了通胀目标（Irwin，2014）。

- en: The United States was having a debate about the inflation rate the Fed should
    target, at the same time. Paul Volcker, who was Fed chair from 1979 to 1987, and
    his succeeding Fed Chair, Alan Greenspan, who served during this time period and
    until 2006, favored an inflation rate that was 0% to 1% (Sommer, 2023). They argued
    that this target was minimal enough to not affect business decisions, and prices
    would stay stable. However, Fed Governor and later Fed Chair, Janet Yellen, favored
    a higher inflation target that would allow for the Fed to take greater action
    if there was a recession (Sommer, 2023). She argued that, if there is a recession
    and the inflation rate is already very low, then there would be a high risk of
    deflation. Although the idea of a more valuable dollar may sound great, many economists
    think it is worse than high inflation (Engeman, 2019). The problem is that the
    value of money would increase when people do nothing with it. This would be problematic
    since people would not invest or spend money to get the country out of a recession
    when they could just get a return from doing nothing. Instead of taking a risk
    and investing the money, the velocity of money decreases, and there is less spending
    leading to higher unemployment and less growth. The cycle could then create more
    deflation and less spending, putting the country into a self-fulfilling recession
    cycle.

  zh: 与此同时，美国正在就联邦储备委员会应该设定的通胀率进行辩论。保罗·沃尔克（Paul Volcker）是1979年至1987年的联邦储备委员会主席，他的继任者艾伦·格林斯潘（Alan
    Greenspan）在此期间及2006年前任职，他们支持设定0%至1%的通胀率（Sommer，2023）。他们认为这个目标足够小，不会影响商业决策，价格将保持稳定。然而，现任联储理事和后来的联储主席珍妮特·耶伦（Janet
    Yellen）支持更高的通胀目标，这将允许联储在经济衰退时采取更大的行动（Sommer，2023）。她认为，如果经济衰退且通胀率已经非常低，那么就存在通货紧缩的高风险。尽管拥有更有价值的美元听起来很好，但许多经济学家认为这比高通胀更糟糕（Engeman，2019）。问题在于，当人们不用钱做任何事情时，货币的价值会增加。这将是一个问题，因为人们不会投资或花钱来帮助国家摆脱经济衰退，而只是通过什么都不做来获得回报。而不是冒险投资这些钱，货币速度降低，支出减少导致失业率上升和经济增长减缓。这一循环可能导致更多通货紧缩和更少支出，使国家陷入自我实现的衰退周期。
- en: During the late 1990s, Japan saw the deflationary fear come true, where a deflationary
    economy created a decades-long stagnation. Combined with the mild 2001 post 9/11
    recession, the argument to have a higher inflation target in the U.S. was strengthened
    (Irwin,2014). Thus, the implicit 1% target started gradually increasing. One analysis
    of FOMC meetings found that the Fed preferred an implicit target of 1.5 core inflation
    from 2000 to 2007 (Shaprio, Wilson, 2019). However, after the 2008 recession,
    the consensus shifted to a compromise of 2% inflation target in line with New
    Zealand, which was later made official in 2012 by Fed Chair Ben Bernanke, which
    is still in place today (Shapiro, Wilson, 2019).

  zh: 在1990年代末，日本看到了通缩恐惧成真，通缩经济导致了数十年的停滞。再加上轻微的2001年911后经济衰退，加强了在美国设定更高通胀目标的论点（Irwin,
    2014）。因此，隐含的1%目标逐渐增加。一项对FOMC会议的分析发现，美联储在2000年至2007年期间更倾向于一个隐含的1.5%核心通胀目标（Shaprio,
    Wilson, 2019）。然而，2008年经济衰退后，共识转向了与新西兰一致的2%通胀目标的折衷方案，这一方案在2012年由联邦储备委员会主席本·伯南克正式设立，至今仍然有效（Shapiro,
    Wilson, 2019）。
- en: The above current events show that an inflation target has some power and inflation
    seems to show that inflation targets have some power. A study by the IMF confirms
    this and says, “Nonetheless, empirical evidence on the performance of inflation
    targeting is broadly, though not totally, supportive of the effectiveness of the
    framework in delivering low inflation, anchoring inflation expectations, and lowering
    inflation volatility. Moreover, these gains in inflation performance were achieved
    with no adverse effects on output and interest volatility” (Jahan, 2010). However,
    is 2% the right number? The first problem is that if the Fed does change its inflation
    target, it loses a lot of its credibility, which is what the inflation target’s
    power comes from.

  zh: 以上的当前事件显示，通胀目标具有一定的影响力，通胀似乎表明通胀目标具有一定的影响力。国际货币基金组织的一项研究证实了这一点，并表示：“尽管如此，关于通胀目标框架在提供低通胀、锚定通胀预期和降低通胀波动性方面的实证证据在广泛上，尽管不是完全，支持其有效性。此外，这些通胀表现的收益是在没有对产出和利率波动性造成不良影响的情况下实现的”（Jahan,
    2010）。然而，2%是否是合适的数字？首要问题是，如果美联储确实改变其通胀目标，那么它将失去很多其信誉，而通胀目标的力量正是来自于此。
- en: This loss of trust is a major problem. For example, if you no longer believe
    the Fed inflation target, then you will base your actions on what you think the
    inflation rate will be, which can lead to cycles of inflation. If you believe
    inflation will be high soon, you will buy a lot of stuff now when prices are lower.
    However, other people will realize this too, and then there will be a race to
    buy goods and services, which will lead to less supply and higher prices. This
    creates more demand, which leads to higher prices, creating the inflationary doom
    loop. Showing that losing the Fed’s credibility may not be worth the benefit of
    a better target.

  zh: 这种信任缺失是一个主要问题。例如，如果你不再相信美联储的通胀目标，那么你将根据你认为的通胀率采取行动，这可能导致通胀循环。如果你认为通胀很快会上升，你会在价格较低时现在购买大量商品。然而，其他人也会意识到这一点，然后会出现购买商品和服务的竞赛，这将导致供应减少和价格上涨。这创造了更多的需求，导致价格上涨，从而形成通胀的恶性循环。这表明，失去美联储的信誉可能不值得更好的目标所带来的好处。
- en: The story of the inflation target is one which is much more random and less
    thought through than you would expect. A politician and central banker which few
    around the world knew changed world economic history, and created one of the most
    powerful monetary policy tools. However the world has cemented this target into
    the core assumptions of the world economy and there would be repercussions all
    around if we changed the target. Each target has trade offs but perhaps finding
    an optimal level would lead to a more prosperous world.
