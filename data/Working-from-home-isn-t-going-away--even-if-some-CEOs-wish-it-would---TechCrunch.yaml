- en: When I started working from home in the late 1980s as a freelance technical
    writer, I was clearly an outlier. Even contractors mostly went into the office
    in those days. Over time, though, that slowly changed, and the pandemic — along
    with generationally shifting views on work-life balance — accelerated worker sentiment
    away from going into a formal office every day, even if some CEOs wish it weren’t
    so.

    toward working in the office. Some have suggested that it’s because these companies
    have invested heavily in office buildings and need people to fill them. Maybe

    [并不一定如此](https://business.pitt.edu/return-to-office-mandates-dont-improve-employee-or-company-performance/)。

    Group, who has studied and written extensively about remote work, says she was

    to the office are unsurprisingly having to deal with more employee burnout. “The
    argument so many times behind this return to office mandate is that employees
    will be more productive because we can collaborate in person and, and things get
    done. Well, being burnt out and sustaining a burnout level is the opposite of
    being more productive,” she said.
