- en: Tai chi, a traditional, slow-moving form of Chinese martial art, is known to
    increase flexibility and improve balance. Now, new research suggests it's better
    than more vigorous aerobic exercises for lowering blood pressure in people with
    prehypertension.

    reach the level of high blood pressure, or hypertension. It's considered a warning

    add to a large body of research pointing to health benefits from tai chi, a wellness
    practice that combines slow, gentle movements and postures with mindfulness. It's

- en: In the study, researchers in China randomly assigned 342 adults with prehypertension
    to one of two interventions. The average age of participants was 49\. Roughly
    half the people participated in supervised aerobic exercise, including jogging,
    climbing stairs, brisk walking and cycling. The other half was trained to practice
    tai chi. Both groups got hourlong sessions four times a week.

    pressure than those in the aerobic exercise group. What's more, nearly 22% of
    the people who practiced tai chi saw their blood pressure fall to within normal
    range, compared with nearly 16% of people in the aerobic exercise group. And fewer
    patients in the tai chi group went on to develop hypertension than in the aerobic
