    and Sunnyvale, California, on Tuesday](https://www.wired.com/story/google-no-tech-for-apartheid-project-nimbus-israel-gaza-protest/)
    in protest of the company''s $1.2 billion contract providing cloud computing services
    to the Israeli government. The [sit-in](https://www.instagram.com/p/C51DSugON4G/?igsh=MXU1cm0zdnQxNTdncA==),
    organized by the activist group No Tech for Apartheid, is happening at Google
    Cloud CEO Thomas Kurian''s office in Sunnyvale and the 10th floor commons of Google''s
    New York office. The sit-in will be accompanied by outdoor protests at Google
    offices in New York, Sunnyvale, San Francisco, and Seattle beginning at 2 pm ET
    and 11 am PT. Tuesday''s actions mark an escalation in a series of recent protests
    organized by tech workers who oppose their employer''s relationship with the Israeli
    government, especially in light of Israel''s ongoing assault on Gaza. Since Hamas
    killed about 1,100 Israelis on October 7, the IDF has killed more than 34,000
    Palestinians.'

- en: Just over a dozen people gathered outside Google's offices in New York and Sunnyvale
    on Tuesday. Among those in New York was Google cloud software engineer Eddie Hatfield,
    who was fired days after [disrupting](https://hellgatenyc.com/pro-palestine-protest-eric-adams-israeli-tech-conference)
    Google Israel's managing director at March's Mind The Tech, a company-sponsored
    conference focused on the Israeli tech industry, in early March. Several hours
    into the sit-ins on Tuesday, Google security began to accuse the workers of "trespassing"
    and disrupting work, prompting several people to leave while others vowed to remain
    until they were forced out. The 2021 contract, known as Project Nimbus, involves
    Google and Amazon jointly providing cloud computing infrastructure and services
    across branches of the Israeli government. Last week, Time reported that Google's
    work on Project Nimbus involves providing [direct services to the Israel Defense
    Forces](https://time.com/6966102/google-contract-israel-defense-ministry-gaza-war/).

    sponsorship of the conference. After Hatfield was fired three days later, Google
    trust-and-safety-policy employee Vidana Abdel Khalek resigned from her position
    in opposition to Project Nimbus. Then, in late March, more than 300 Apple workers
    signed an open letter that alleged retaliation against workers who have expressed
    support for Palestinians, and urged company leadership to show public support
    for Palestinians. Hasan Ibraheem, a Google software engineer, is participating
    in the sit-in at his local Google office in New York. "This has really been a
    culmination of our efforts," he tells WIRED. Since joining No Tech for Apartheid
    in December, Ibraheem says, he has been participating in weekly "tabling" actions
    being held at Google office cafes in New York, Sunnyvale, San Francisco, and Mountain
    View, California. It involves holding a sign that says "Ask me about Project Nimbus"
    during lunch break, passing out flyers, and answering questions from coworkers.
    "It's actually shocking how many people at Google don't even know that this contract
    exists," Ibraheem says. "A lot of people who don't know about it, who then learn
    about it through us, are reasonably upset that this contract exists. They just
    didn't know that it existed beforehand."*

  zh: 3月4日，超过600名谷歌员工签署请愿书，反对公司赞助该会议。三天后，哈特菲尔德被解雇，随后，谷歌信任与安全政策员工维达娜·阿卜杜勒·哈立克因反对“尼姆布斯计划”而辞去了她的职位。然后，3月底，超过300名苹果员工签署了一封公开信，声称公司对支持巴勒斯坦人的员工进行报复，并敦促公司领导公开支持巴勒斯坦人。谷歌软件工程师哈桑·伊布拉希姆正在参与纽约本地谷歌办公室的静坐示威。他告诉《连线》杂志说：“这真的是我们努力的结晶。”自去年12月加入“无技术支持种族隔离”以来，伊布拉希姆说，他一直在纽约、圣尼瓦尔、旧金山和加州山景城的谷歌办公室咖啡厅参加每周一次的“摆表”行动。这包括在午餐休息时间举着“请问我关于尼姆布斯计划”的牌子，分发传单，并回答同事们的问题。“其实令人震惊的是，在谷歌有多少人甚至不知道这份合同的存在，”伊布拉希姆说。“很多人在通过我们了解到它之后，都对这个合同的存在感到合理地不满。他们之前根本不知道它的存在。”
