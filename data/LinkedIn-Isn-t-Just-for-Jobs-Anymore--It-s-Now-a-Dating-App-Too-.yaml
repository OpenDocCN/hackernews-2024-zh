    messages on the workplace-focused social-media site before, these were different.
    "They would disguise it, like, 'I have this company and I'm looking for someone
    to fill this position,'" John, a 24-year-old personal organizer in New York City,
    told me. While each of the men had the plausible deniability of a connection or
    two in common with her, she said it was immediately clear that their motives were
    not strictly professional — one of them worked in the oil industry, a field far
    removed from anything she'd ever done for a living. Someone else might have scoffed

    约翰，纽约市的一名 24 岁的私人组织者告诉我。虽然这三个男人中的每一个都与她有一两个共同的联系，但她说，很快就明显地意识到他们的动机并不纯粹专业 —— 其中一个人在石油行业工作，这是她以前从未涉足过的领域。其他人可能会对他们的进展嗤之以鼻，但约翰当时刚刚单身，她对此感到好奇。

  zh: “通知文化——手机思维——有点占据了主导地位，”贝格告诉我。“就约会应用而言，我认为每个人，尤其是疫情后，都变得有点厌倦了。我们厌倦了来自同样约会应用的相同提示和相同类型的联系。”
- en: Begg has noticed more people choose to forgo digital communication where possible
    and seek out "IRL situations" for interaction, she said. Some of her friends have
    gone so far as to delete dating apps from their phones in an effort to meet people
    in person. For her part, Begg has installed a landline phone in her apartment
    to facilitate smartphone-free weekends — much to the delight of her analog-curious,
    film-camera-shooting Gen Z cousins.

  zh: 贝格注意到，越来越多的人选择尽可能放弃数字通信，寻求“现实生活中的场景”进行互动，她说。她的一些朋友甚至已经走得更远，从手机中删除了约会应用，希望能够面对面地认识人。至于贝格自己，她在公寓里安装了一部座机电话，以便在周末不使用智能手机——这让她热衷于模拟时代、拍摄胶片相机的千禧一代表亲戚感到高兴。

- en: While LinkedIn is, of course, a digital platform, Begg believes that some users
    may be drawn to the site by their desire to replicate (or at least mimic) an analog,
    water-cooler experience, she added. In many real-life workplaces, that experience
    has been either diminished or lost entirely through the rise of [remote and hybrid
    work](https://www.businessinsider.com/remote-work-fueling-gen-z-job-anxiety-stress-mental-health-2023-12).
    A significant proportion of younger professionals may have missed out on this
    type of in-person workplace camaraderie altogether, which could help to explain
    LinkedIn's recent surge in popularity [among teens](https://www.thecut.com/article/why-teenagers-love-linkedin.html)
    and [20-somethings](https://www.fastcompany.com/90921792/why-gen-z-is-flocking-from-twitter-to-linkedin).

  zh: 尽管领英当然是一个数字平台，但贝格补充说，一些用户可能被他们对复制（或至少模仿）模拟、水塔的体验的渴望所吸引。在许多现实生活中的工作场所，这种体验要么被削弱，要么完全消失，这是通过[远程和混合工作](https://www.businessinsider.com/remote-work-fueling-gen-z-job-anxiety-stress-mental-health-2023-12)的兴起实现的。许多年轻专业人士可能根本没有经历过这种面对面的工作场所的友情，这可能有助于解释为什么领英近年来在[青少年](https://www.thecut.com/article/why-teenagers-love-linkedin.html)和[20多岁的人中](https://www.fastcompany.com/90921792/why-gen-z-is-flocking-from-twitter-to-linkedin)的人气激增。

- en: Plus, [LinkedIn](https://www.businessinsider.com/how-linkedin-got-weird-work-life-blurred-lines-of-oversharing-2023-9)
    itself is becoming less strictly professional. "LinkedIn influencers are a thing,
    and I'm noticing a lot more content on LinkedIn that is a bit more social or outside
    of work," Warren, the TikToker who posts about dating, said. "People are more
    comfortable saying, 'Here's how I spend my time off,' or, 'Here's what I do after
