    The brain is immersed in cerebrospinal fluid; when a surgeon opens the skull,
    pressure is released, and parts of the brain surge up toward the exit while gravity
    starts pulling others down. This can happen with special force if a tumor has
    rendered the skull overstuffed. A brain can shift by as much as an inch during
    a typical neurosurgery, and surgeons, who plan their routes with precision, can
    struggle as the territory moves.

- en: In the nineteen-nineties, David Roberts, a neurosurgeon, and Keith Paulsen,
    an engineer, decided to tackle this problem by building a mathematical model of
    a brain in motion. Real brains contain billions of nooks and crannies, but their
    model wouldn’t need to include them; it could be an abstraction encoded in the
    language of calculus. They could model the brain as a simple, sponge-like object
    immersed in a flow of fluid and divided into compartments. Equations could predict
    how the compartments would move with each surgical action. The model might tell
    surgeons to make the first cut a half inch to the right of where they’d planned
    to start, and then to continue inward at an angle of forty-three degrees rather
    than forty-seven.

- en: Roberts and Paulsen designed their model on blackboards at Dartmouth College.
    Their design had its first clinical test in 1998\. A thirty-five-year-old man
    with intractable epilepsy required the removal of a small tumor. He was anesthetized,
    his skull was cut open, and his brain began to move. The model drew on data taken
    from a preoperative MRI scan, and tracked the movement of certain physical landmarks
    during the surgery; in this way, the real and predicted topography of the exposed
    brain could be compared, and the new position of the tumor could be predicted.
    “The agreement between prediction and reality was amazing,” Roberts recalled recently.

    neurosurgeries. Modelling, in general, is now routine. We model everything, from
    elections to economics, from the climate to the coronavirus. Like model cars,

    simplified representations that get the salient parts right. Like fashion models,
    model citizens, and model children, they’re also idealized versions of reality.
    But idealization and abstraction can be forms of strength. In an old mathematical-modelling
    joke, a group of experts is hired to improve milk production on a dairy farm.
    One of them, a physicist, suggests, “Consider a spherical cow.” Cows aren’t spheres
    any more than brains are jiggly sponges, but the point of modelling—in some ways,
    the joy of it—is to see how far you can get by using only general scientific principles,
    translated into mathematics, to describe messy reality.

- en: To be successful, a model needs to replicate the known while generalizing into
    the unknown. This means that, as more becomes known, a model has to be improved
    to stay relevant. Sometimes new developments in math or computing enable progress.
    In other cases, modellers have to look at reality in a fresh way. For centuries,
    a predilection for perfect circles, mixed with a bit of religious dogma, produced
    models that described the motion of the sun, moon, and planets in an Earth-centered
    universe; these models worked, to some degree, but never perfectly. Eventually,
    more data, combined with more expansive thinking, ushered in a better model—a
    heliocentric solar system based on elliptical orbits. This model, in turn, helped
    kick-start the development of calculus, reveal the law of gravitational attraction,
    and fill out our map of the solar system. New knowledge pushes models forward,

    a future in which militaries waged precision “climatological warfare.” This idea
    may have seemed mathematically plausible at the time; later, the discovery of
    the “butterfly effect”—when a butterfly flaps its wings in Tokyo, the forecast
    changes in New York—showed it to be unworkable. In 2008, financial analysts thought
    they’d modelled the housing market; they hadn’t. Models aren’t always good enough.

    what the physicist Eugene Wigner called “the unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics.”

    water (salty or not), vegetation, desert. Energy that’s been absorbed by the Earth
    warms the surface and then radiates up and out, where it can be intercepted by
    clouds, or interact with chemicals in different layers of the atmosphere, including
    the greenhouse gases—carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide. Heat differentials

    The division helps with interpretability. One of the many striking figures in
