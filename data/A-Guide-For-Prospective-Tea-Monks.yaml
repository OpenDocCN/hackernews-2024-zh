    or there could be an opportunity for sponsorships. Maybe pop up or even permanent
    tea parlours might be created in bigger cities where people could drop in. But
    I'd like to envision a future world where all tea will ultimately be free, followed
    by free food, and then free housing too, and in which kindness was the currency
    instead of money.
