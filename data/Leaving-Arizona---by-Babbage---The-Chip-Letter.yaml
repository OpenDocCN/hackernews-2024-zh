    were both restricted in the number of registers they could afford to include.
    As a result, both chips would need to load and store values from memory more often
    than a competitor like the Intel 8080, which had many more registers. So, both
    the 6800 and the 6502 had two-byte instructions that would store the value in
    an accumulator to a specified location in page zero (hexadecimal addresses 0000
    to 00FF) in memory. For both processors, this would execute in three clock cycles.

    8080 那样拥有更多寄存器。因此，6800 和 6502 都有两字节指令，用于将值存储到内存中的指定位置（十六进制地址 0000 到 00FF）中的累加器。对于这两个处理器，这将在三个时钟周期内执行。

    Rodney H. Orgill, William D. Mensch, Wilbur L. Mattys, Terry N. Holdt, Ernie B.
    Hirt, and Harry E. Bawcom) left Motorola and joined MOS Technology in similar
    posts and helped establish that firm's line of MCS6500 microprocessors. The suit
    seeks triple damages plus all profits MOS Technology has made on the 6500 product
    line. MOS Technology has denied the allegations and stated that Motorola's claims
    are unfounded.

  zh: Motorola 正在寻求对 MOS Technology 提出禁令，以阻止其制造、营销和填补 MCS 6500 微处理器产品订单。禁令行动旨在阻止 MOS
    Technology 在费城联邦法院提起的一项诉讼的结果之前继续进行 6500 活动。迄今为止，禁令尝试都未成功。 Motorola 援引了几项导致其自己
    MC6800 微处理器开发的 Motorola 专利，声称七名前 Motorola 员工（Charles J. Peddle、Rodney H. Orgill、William
    D. Mensch、Wilbur L. Mattys、Terry N. Holdt、Ernie B. Hirt 和 Harry E. Bawcom）离开了
    Motorola 并加入了 MOS Technology 从事类似职务，并帮助建立了该公司的 MCS6500 微处理器系列。该诉讼要求三倍赔偿金以及 MOS
    Technology 在 6500 产品线上获得的所有利润。MOS Technology 否认了这些指控，并表示 Motorola 的主张毫无根据。
- en: In reality, although the MOS Technology team had used their experience with
    the 6800 when designing the 6501/2, there was very little technology used in the
    new designs that Motorola could claim as their own. The fabrication process and
    the instruction sets were both fundamentally different. The only significant thing
    that they shared with the 6800 was the pin layout of the 6501.

  zh: 实际上，尽管 MOS Technology 团队在设计 6501/2 时利用了他们在 6800 上的经验，但新设计中使用的技术 Motorola 几乎不能称为自己的。制造工艺和指令集都是根本不同的。与
    6800 唯一显著的共享之处是 6501 的引脚布局。
- en: The financial and legal resources available to Motorola, though, dwarfed those
    of the much smaller MOS Technology, which was running out of cash. So MOS Technology
    settled, dropped the 6501, paid $200,000 in damages and returned some documentation
    that the engineers had taken with them from Motorola. The two companies also cross
    licensed patents.

  zh: Motorola 可以动用的财务和法律资源比远远超过了规模小得多、资金枯竭的 MOS Technology。因此，MOS Technology 达成了和解，放弃了
    6501，支付了 20 万美元的损害赔偿，并归还了工程师从 Motorola 带走的一些文档。两家公司还进行了交叉许可专利。
- en: There is a difference of opinion in the MOS Technology team about their original
    intentions around the 6501\. Rod Orgill, who led its design, bet Mensch, who led
    the 6502’s design, that the 6501 would outsell the 6502\. Peddle maintained that
    it was always intended to give Motorola a target to aim for which could be given
    up when they sued. In any event, the 6501 was designed, built and featured in
    early documentation and advertisements, but was never sold to customers.

  zh: MOS Technology 团队对于他们对 6501 的最初意图存在不同意见。领导其设计的 Rod Orgill 和领导 6502 设计的 Mensch
    打赌，认为 6501 的销量会超过 6502。Peddle 认为，它始终是为了给摩托罗拉一个目标而设计的，可以在他们起诉时放弃。无论如何，6501 被设计、制造，并出现在早期文档和广告中，但从未销售给客户。
- en: The 6502 remained on sale though. By the end of 1975, MOS Technology had a new
    and more financially stable owner in the shape of Commodore. With the lawsuit
    settled and MOS Technology under new ownership, it was soon clear that Motorola’s
    management had, with the move to Austin, stimulated the creation of a new and
    credible competitor.

  zh: 6502 仍然在销售中。到 1975 年底，MOS Technology 的新的、更加财务稳定的所有者是 Commodore。随着诉讼的解决和 MOS
    Technology 被新的所有者收购，很快就清楚摩托罗拉的管理层通过搬迁到奥斯汀刺激了一个新的、可信的竞争对手的诞生。
- en: The combination of low price and better performance was a winning formula for
    the 6502, and it soon found its way into designs that might otherwise have used
    the 6800\. The most famous example of this happened in 1975 when Steve Wozniak
    wanted to build his own single-board computer. Having compared the Intel 8080
    and the 6800, he settled on the Motorola chip, preferring its more elegant instruction
    set, and worked to develop his design using the chip.

  zh: 低价格和更好性能的结合是 6502 的制胜公式，很快就被应用到本来可能会使用 6800 的设计中。1975 年，史蒂夫·沃兹尼亚克想要建造自己的单板计算机。在比较了
    Intel 8080 和 6800 之后，他选择了摩托罗拉芯片，因为他更喜欢它更简洁的指令集，并致力于使用该芯片开发他的设计。
- en: But even the reduced $175 cost of the 6800 was more than Wozniak could manage.
    When the 6502 appeared at the end of 1975 its $25 price was, at last, affordable
    so he switched to the MOS Technology design. Wozniak teamed up with Steve Jobs,
    turned his single board design into a commercial product, and sold it as the Apple
    computer. The design would retain the ability to use a 6800, though, with space
    allocated on the circuit board for the Motorola design to be used in place of
    the 6502\. However, none of the computers, later known as the Apple I, were ever
    adapted to use the 6800.

  zh: 但即使 6800 的价格降至 175 美元，沃兹尼亚克也无法承担。当 6502 在 1975 年底出现时，它的 25 美元的价格终于可以接受，所以他转而选择了
    MOS Technology 的设计。沃兹尼亚克与史蒂夫·乔布斯合作，将他的单板设计变成了商业产品，并将其作为苹果计算机出售。设计仍然保留了使用 6800
    的能力，尽管在电路板上为摩托罗拉设计留有空间，以便用于取代 6502。然而，后来被称为苹果 I 的计算机从未被改造为使用 6800。

    the processor in a range of popular Commodore computer designs from the PET and
    VIC 20 to the Commodore 64\. Ownership by Commodore proved to be no barrier to
