    flight from takeoff in Columbus, Ohio, to touchdown at Los Angeles International
    Airport. That evening, the first of February 1991, the weather was perfectly clear,
    the Boeing 737 had a clean sheet with no mechanical faults, and with the runway
    in sight from 25 miles out, the approach was uneventful. Flying the plane from
    the right seat, First Officer David Kelly pulled the nose up to ease the touchdown
    and greased it onto runway 24 Left. He then brought the nose back down, smooth
    and steady. And then, without time to even shout, all hell broke loose.

  zh: 对于美国航空1493号航班上的89名乘客和机组人员来说，这是一次平凡无奇的飞行，从俄亥俄州哥伦布市起飞，到洛杉矶国际机场降落。那天晚上，1991年2月1日，天气晴朗，波音737飞机没有任何机械故障，从25英里外就能看到跑道，途中没有发生任何意外。副驾驶大卫·凯利从右边的座位驾驶飞机，将机头拉起以缓解着陆，并将其顺利地落在了24号左跑道上。然后，他将鼻子放了下来，平稳而稳定。然后，在甚至来不及大喊一声的时间里，一切都乱了套。
- en: Kelly would later recall seeing the brief flash of a propeller before he instinctively
    pushed the brake pedal to the floor, but it was much too late. With a powerful
    jolt and a metallic screech, the 737 plowed into a small commuter plane, crushing
    the hapless turboprop beneath and propelling it forward down the runway at over
    90 miles an hour. In the cabin of the 737, the lights went out and fire billowed
    past the windows. Locked together, the two planes veered left, crossed a grass
    strip and a taxiway, and collided at freeway speed with an abandoned airport fire
    station.

    underneath the USAir 737, sending plumes of smoke into the cabin. Passengers fought
    their way to the exits amid choking fumes, braving long drops and roaring flames
    in their frantic rush to escape. Not everyone made it: firefighters would later
    discover the bodies of 19 passengers and a flight attendant lying in the aisle,

    bringing the final death toll to 35.'

    is standard practice after a crash. After hearing about the propeller, she knew
    she must have cleared USAir flight 1493 to land on an occupied runway. As tower
    supervisors searched for any sign of a missing commuter flight, Wascher left the
    room. Replaying the events in her mind, she realized that the missing plane was
    SkyWest flight 5569, a 19-seat Fairchild Metroliner twin turboprop bound for Palmdale.
    Several minutes before clearing the USAir jet to land, she had told flight 5569
    to “taxi into position and hold” on runway 24L. But she could not recall having
    cleared it for takeoff. The plane was probably still sitting “in position” on
    the runway waiting for her instructions when the USAir 737 plowed into it from
    behind. It was a devastating realization, but an important one, so in an act of
    great bravery, she returned to the tower, pointed to flight 5569, and told her
    supervisor, “This is what I believe USAir hit.”

    flight took off on runway 24R and had to be handed to the next controller. Unfortunately,
    amid these multiple distractions, she simply forgot that SkyWest 5569 was still

    this is called a “blameless postmortem,” and in aviation, it’s a long-standing,
    internationally formalized tradition. In the mid-20th century, when technical
    investigations of aircraft accidents were first being standardized, an understanding
    emerged that many crashes were not the result of any particular person’s actions.
    Most famously, in 1956, the Civil Aeronautics Board’s Bureau of Aviation Safety,
    the predecessor to today’s NTSB, concluded that no one was at fault in a collision
    of two airliners over the Grand Canyon because the two crews likely could not
    have seen each other coming until it was too late. The cause of the accident,
    they determined, was the lack of any positive means to prevent midair collisions.

- en: The exact origins of this norm are debatable, but we might speculate that it
    arose from several factors, including the lack of survivors or witnesses in many
    early aircraft accidents, which left scant evidence with which to assign fault;
    the fact that pilots held high status in society and many were reluctant to blame
    them in the absence of such evidence; and the presumption that flying was dangerous
    and that disaster was not always an aberration of nature. These realities likely
    predisposed aeronautical experts to think in terms other than blame.

- en: The end result was that the aviation industry became one of the first to embrace
    the concept of a “blameless postmortem” as a legally codified principle underpinning
    all investigations. In 1951, compelled by the reality that their industry was
    not widely regarded as safe, aviation experts from around the world gathered to
    compose Annex 13 to the Chicago Convention on International Civil Aviation. This

    13。这一里程碑式文件旨在规范国际民航组织所有成员国之间的飞机事故调查行为。

    follow the spirit of Annex 13, investigators must ask how others could be prevented
    from making the same mistakes in the future. This document, and in particular
    this provision, formed the basis for the modern practice of aircraft accident
    investigation. Most aircraft accident reports around the world today open with

    anything safer. That’s because there was nothing special about Wascher — she was
    simply an average controller with an average record, who came into work that day
    thinking she would safely control planes for a few hours and then go home. That’s
    why in interviews with national media her colleagues hammered home a fundamental
    truth: that what happened to her could have happened to any of them. And if that

    human error are examined; who made a mistake is far less important than why it
    was made.

  zh: 这种方法成功的关键是，只要诚实的错误被当作是错误，而不管后果如何，就能最好地实现安全改进。这个原则是几个先进行业所认可的，被称为“公正文化”概念。一个公正的组织文化认识到只有当人为错误的根本原因被检查时，才能实现高水平的运营安全；犯错的人远不及为什么犯错重要。
- en: A just culture encourages self-reporting of errors in order to gather as much
    data about those errors as possible. In contrast, an organization without a just
    culture will be left unaware of its own vulnerabilities because employees hide
    their mistakes for fear of retribution. Such an organization will discover those
    vulnerabilities only when they result in consequences that are impossible to hide.

  zh: 公正文化鼓励自我报告错误，以收集尽可能多关于这些错误的数据。相反，一个没有公正文化的组织将不知道自己的脆弱性，因为员工为了避免惩罚而隐藏他们的错误。只有当这些脆弱性导致无法隐藏的后果时，这样的组织才会发现它们。
- en: Sometimes disasters happen anyway, and when they do, it’s equally critical that
    the just culture is upheld. Although it can be hard to accept that a mistake that
    led to loss of life might go unpunished, just culture doesn’t permit us to discriminate
    based on the magnitude of the consequences — only on the attitude of the person
    who committed the error. If they were acting in good faith when the mistake occurred,
    then a harsh reaction would undermine the trust between employees and management
    that facilitates the just culture. But even more importantly, it would undermine
    the blameless investigative process that makes modern aviation so safe. Investigative
    agencies like the NTSB rely on truthful statements from those involved in an accident
    in order to determine what happened and why, and the truth can’t be acquired when
    individuals fear punishment for speaking it. Indeed, if Wascher were charged with
    a crime, her lawyers would have been required to produce a defense, and the investigative
    waters would have been forever clouded.

  zh: 有时候，灾难还是会发生，当这种情况发生时，同样重要的是要维护公正文化。尽管很难接受导致生命丧失的错误可能不会受到惩罚，但公正文化不允许我们根据后果的严重程度来歧视——只能根据犯错误者的态度。如果犯错时他们是出于善意的，那么严厉的反应会破坏员工和管理层之间促成公正文化的信任。但更重要的是，它会破坏无罪调查过程，使现代航空业如此安全。调查机构如NTSB依赖于事故中涉及者的真实陈述，以确定发生了什么以及为什么发生了，当个人害怕因言说而受到惩罚时，就无法获取真相。事实上，如果瓦舍被指控犯罪，她的律师将被要求提出辩护，调查的水平将永远被混淆。

    in 1983 an Air Canada Boeing 767 famously landed on a drag strip in Manitoba after
    running out of fuel in flight, an incident known as the “Gimli Glider.” The captain
    of the flight was found to have taken off without working fuel gauges, in direct
    contradiction of airworthiness requirements, which stipulate that at least one
    gauge must be working.

  zh: 这个问题的例子在整个航空史上都能找到。例如，1983年，一架加拿大航空波音767飞机因燃油耗尽在曼尼托巴州的一条飞机跑道上降落，这一事件被称为“吉姆利滑翔机”。这次航班的机长被发现在起飞时没有检查燃油计量器是否工作，直接违反了适航要求，适航要求规定至少有一个计量器必须工作。
- en: At that time accident investigations in Canada were assigned to a commission
    of inquiry led by a judge who possessed the power to recommend criminal prosecution
    of anyone involved (a power that the NTSB does not wield). During the investigation,
    the flight’s captain told investigators that he examined the master minimum equipment
    list, which describes the systems that may be inoperative when dispatching an
    airplane. He allegedly observed that at least one fuel gauge was required but
    then learned from a maintenance technician that Air Canada “Maintenance Central”
    had cleared the plane to fly in that condition, overriding the MMEL.

  zh: 当时，加拿大的事故调查被分配给由法官领导的调查委员会，该法官拥有建议对涉及人员进行刑事起诉的权力（NTSB不具备此权力）。在调查期间，飞行的机长告诉调查人员，他检查了主要最低设备清单，该清单描述了飞机调度时可以不工作的系统。据称，他观察到至少需要一个燃油计量器，但后来从一名维修技术员那里得知加拿大航空的“维修中心”已经批准飞机以这种状态飞行，覆盖了MMEL。
- en: However, everyone else who was present, including the first officer and two
    maintenance techs, denied that anyone had mentioned a clearance from Maintenance
    Central or that the MMEL was ever consulted. Indeed, not only did Maintenance
    Central not give the claimed clearance, it lacked the authority to do so even
    if it wanted to. Considering this testimony, it seems likely that the captain
    simply failed to check whether dispatch with two inoperative fuel gauges was allowed.
    But because he could have exposed himself to the threat of prosecution if he admitted
    to such a lapse, he (or his lawyers) may have come up with the alternative story
    in order to preclude the possibility of retaliation. Therefore, the exact reason
    why he decided to take off with no fuel gauges couldn’t be determined conclusively.

  zh: 然而，其他在场的人，包括副驾驶和两名维修技术员，都否认有人提到过从维修中心获得许可或者咨询MMEL的事情。事实上，维修中心不仅没有给出所声称的许可，即使想这样做也没有权限。考虑到这些证词，机长显然没有检查过是否允许起飞时有两个不工作的燃油计量器。但是，由于如果他承认了这样的疏忽就可能面临起诉的威胁，他（或他的律师）可能为了防止可能的报复而想出了另一种说法。因此，他决定在没有燃油计量器的情况下起飞的确切原因不能得出确定性结论。
- en: Fortunately, in many countries (including present-day Canada) this is not the
    case. Not only does the NTSB have no law enforcement power, but its findings are
    legally inadmissible as evidence of liability. In the United States, Robin Wascher
    is a shining example of bravery in truth-telling, but plenty of other pilots and
    controllers who made mistakes have done the same, because assurances exist that
    what they tell the NTSB will not be used in court.

    experts. Equally as often, pilots who make honest mistakes get to keep their jobs,
    such as the first officer aboard American Airlines flight 1420, whose failure
    to arm the ground spoilers before landing in Little Rock in 1999 contributed to
    a runway overrun accident that killed 11 people. As of 2019 he was still flying
    for American Airlines — and had been promoted to captain — because his mistake
    was due to deeper cultural issues in the airline industry. And besides, given
    what he went through, it’s hard to imagine that he would ever forget to arm the

    The United States has achieved the safest airline industry in the world through
    rigorous root cause analysis made possible only by a commitment to transparency,
    justice, and truth. While nothing humanity builds is invincible, the safeguards
    that we have erected against human error are so formidable that in the 33 years
    since the crash at LAX, there hasn’t been another fatal runway collision at any
    U.S. airport with a control tower, even as the media breathlessly reports every
    near miss. Globally, airline accidents of all causes have been almost eliminated,
    even as global air traffic increases year-on-year. In 1972, by most measurements
    the nadir of global aviation safety, approximately one in 200,000 airline passengers
    worldwide did not reach their destination alive. Half a century later in 2022,
    this number was one in 17 million. In the U.S., where airline safety has always
    led the global average, no scheduled passenger airline has had a fatal crash in
    15 years.

    Wascher forgetting about an airplane, but rather an unforgiving system that required
