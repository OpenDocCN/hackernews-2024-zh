- en: If you order the tuna mignon at Local Ocean Seafoods, a restaurant in Newport,
    Oregon, the albacore most likely came directly from Brett Montague, captain of
    the *Jo El*. You might even see the 12-meter-long troller docked nearby. Local
    Ocean’s Dungeness crab, lingcod, and salmon also come from the local fleet in
    this town of about 10,400 residents.

  zh: 如果你在俄勒冈州纽波特的Local Ocean Seafoods餐厅点一份金枪鱼脯，那么这条白鲑极有可能直接来自布雷特·蒙塔格船长的*Jo El*号。你甚至可能会看到停泊在附近的12米长拖网船。Local
    Ocean的大珍蟹、岩鱼和三文鱼也都来自这个约有10,400居民的小镇的当地舰队。
- en: This is no small feat. The Oregon Coast Visitors Association estimates that
    90 percent of seafood sold in the state’s coastal towns doesn’t actually come
    from the region. At Local Ocean, offering the local catch is an intentional economic
    model that’s been part of the restaurant’s mission since it opened, says cofounder
    Laura Anderson.

  zh: 这绝非易事。俄勒冈海岸游客协会估计，州内沿海城镇销售的90%海鲜实际上并非来自该地区。作为餐厅创始人之一，安德森说，在Local Ocean，提供当地捕捞的海鲜是其自开业以来使命的一部分，这是一种有意的经济模式。
- en: Anderson, the daughter of a commercial fisher (whose dad was also a commercial
    fisher), and her business partner, Al Pazar, founded Local Ocean at a time when
    salmon and tuna prices were in the tank.

  zh: '安德森是商业渔民的女儿（她的父亲也是商业渔民），她的商业伙伴阿尔·帕扎尔在三文鱼和金枪鱼价格低迷之时创立了Local Ocean。 '
- en: While low commodity prices hurt fishers, they can also depress the local economy.
    When fishers have fewer dollars to spend in town on groceries, gear, and everything
    else, the pain spreads, Anderson says. If prices are too low for too long, it
    can cause a communal downward spiral.

  zh: 低廉的商品价格虽然伤害了渔民，但也会压抑当地经济。安德森说，当渔民在城镇上购买食品、装备和其他物品的支出减少时，痛苦会传播开来。如果价格长期过低，可能会引起共同的经济下行螺旋。
- en: So two decades ago, Anderson and Pazar decided to open a business that would
    buy the highest-quality seafood from the local catch. “It was our intention to
    be a showcase for local seafood species and to offer a different market for fishers
    to sell to—a better market,” she says.

  zh: 二十年前，安德森和帕扎尔决定开办一家业务，从当地捕捞的最高质量海鲜购买。“我们的意图是展示当地海鲜物种，并为渔民提供一个不同的销售市场，一个更好的市场，”她说。
- en: It worked. Local Ocean Seafoods became the kind of restaurant that locals loved
    and visitors raved about. It even survived the pandemic. By that time, though,
    Anderson was the sole owner, and she was tired. She was looking to sell and get
    out of the restaurant grind. But she had worries. Would a new owner continue buying
    local fish? Would they treat her employees well and nurture the same community-minded
    spirit she and Pazar had worked so hard to build? Day after day, she wondered,
    How do we maintain that legacy?

  zh: 这一切都奏效了。Local Ocean Seafoods成为了本地人喜爱、游客赞不绝口的餐厅。它甚至经历了疫情的考验。不过，到了那个时候，安德森已成为唯一的业主，她有些疲倦了。她想要出售并摆脱餐饮行业的繁琐。但她也有顾虑。新业主会继续购买当地的鱼吗？他们会善待她的员工，并培育与她和帕扎尔努力建立的社区精神相同的文化吗？她每天都在想，我们如何保持那个遗产？

  zh: 最后，安德森找到了一个鲜为人知的解决方案：一个称为永续目的信托（PPT）的商业结构。
- en: Patagonia, the US $3-billion outdoor goods brand, [adopted a similar structure
    in 2022](https://www.axios.com/2022/09/14/patagonia-changes-ownership-climate-change).
    The approach has also been successfully used by large European companies for decades—including
    Bosch, makers of everything from home appliances to agricultural machinery parts.
    But according to Susan Gary, a professor emerita at the University of Oregon School
    of Law who helped write the state’s PPT statute, this kind of structure can be
    great for small businesses, too, because it can preserve local control and values.
    That’s a big deal for “small communities, where the business is really important
    to the community,” she says.

  zh: 美国30亿美元的户外用品品牌Patagonia于2022年[采用了类似的结构](https://www.axios.com/2022/09/14/patagonia-changes-ownership-climate-change)。这种方法在几十年来也已被大型欧洲公司成功采用，包括家电和农业机械零部件制造商博世。但根据奥勒冈大学法学院的名誉教授苏珊·加里所说，她帮助起草该州PPT法规，这种结构对小型企业也很有好处，因为它可以保护地方控制和价值观。她说：“对于‘小社区而言，企业对社区真的非常重要。”
- en: A PPT works differently from other business structures. Instead of selling to
    a person or another business, Anderson sold Local Ocean Seafoods to a purpose-built
    trust. Like a new country with its own constitution, this trust has specific values
    written into its founding documents. Even though Anderson has departed, Local
    Ocean is legally bound to continue operating under those values throughout the
    life of the business.

  zh: PPT与其他业务结构的运作方式有所不同。安德森将Local Ocean Seafoods出售给了一家专门设立的信托，而不是卖给个人或其他企业。就像一个拥有自己宪法的新国家，这个信托在其创立文件中明确了特定的价值观。尽管安德森已经离开，Local
    Ocean在法律上被约束在整个业务生命周期内继续遵循这些价值观。
- en: A PPT like Local Ocean is still a for-profit business, Gary says. Managers still
    have to worry about the bottom line, and workers still have to keep customers
    happy. “It’s still about making money,” she says. “The difference is how the profit
    is used.”

  zh: '[Local Ocean](https://www.axios.com/2022/09/14/patagonia-changes-ownership-climate-change)这样的PPT仍然是营利性企业，Gary说。经理们仍然需要关注盈利能力，而员工们仍然需要保持顾客满意度。“这依然是关于赚钱的，”她说。“不同之处在于利润的使用方式。”'
- en: Typically, a business’s owner, whether an individual or a suite of shareholders,
    takes some (or all) of the profit. When Anderson was at the helm, she had living
    expenses to pay like everyone else. But a trust doesn’t have those needs. “When
    you take that out of the equation, all of the profit now can get reinvested for
    the good of the company,” Anderson says.

  zh: 通常情况下，一个企业的所有者，无论是个人还是一群股东，会拿走一部分（或全部）利润。当安德森掌舵时，她也有像其他人一样的生活费用要支付。但信托没有这些需求。“当你把这个因素排除在外时，所有的利润现在都可以为公司的利益而重新投资，”安德森说。
- en: In addition to laying out founding values, PPTs are required to identify beneficiaries.
    In general, these beneficiaries get to share in any profits beyond what’s needed
    to keep the business healthy. At Local Ocean, employees are the first to benefit
    through measures such as equitable profit-sharing. But the trust also enshrines
    its commitment to local seafood as a value, so the restaurant will continue buying
    seafood from local boats.

  zh: 除了明确创立价值观外，PPT还需要确定受益人。通常情况下，这些受益人可以分享超过保持业务健康所需的任何利润。在Local Ocean，员工是首先通过公平的利润分享等措施从中受益的人。但信托还确立了其对当地海鲜的承诺作为一种价值观，因此餐厅将继续从本地船只购买海鲜。
- en: Crucially, the trust structure ensures that the restaurant can’t be sold to
    an entity that’s more focused on sending profits to absentee shareholders than
    providing income to the local folks whose labor makes the business run. To keep
    everything on track, Local Ocean is overseen by a board.

  zh: 至关重要的是，信托结构确保餐厅不能被出售给更多关注向不在场股东发送利润而不是为当地劳动力提供收入的实体。为了保持一切顺利，Local Ocean由一个董事会监督。
- en: When Patagonia’s owner put his company into a trust, he essentially gave his
    company away. But Anderson, like most business owners who create a PPT, walked
    away with a nest egg. The transaction was financed by a lending institution that
    helps support alternative ownership models. Now, she’s starting a new project,
    feeling confident Local Ocean will stay true to its coastal values.

  zh: 当Patagonia的所有者将他的公司放入信托时，他本质上是在放弃他的公司。但像大多数创建PPT的企业所有者一样，安德森带着一笔巢穴走了。这笔交易由一家支持替代所有权模式的贷款机构融资。现在，她正在启动一个新项目，并且对Local
    Ocean能够保持其沿海价值感到十分自信。
