- en: The study also points to how crucial the timing of vaccination is. “The girls
    that didn’t develop any cancer were vaccinated before becoming sexually active,”
    said Schlemer. “So we should not wait to vaccinate folks and really do it, for
    the guidelines, prior to becoming sexually active.”

    岁之间接种了疫苗，而 12.4 万名女性在 14 岁或之后接种了疫苗。剩下的女性，将近 30 万名，没有接种疫苗。

    the three-dose protocol between the ages of 14 and 22 also benefited significantly.
    While some cases of cervical cancer were recorded in this group, the incidence

    vaccinated women, caused by the HPV strains not targeted by the earlier vaccines.
    “There are obviously other HPV types that cause cancer,” Palmer said, noting that
