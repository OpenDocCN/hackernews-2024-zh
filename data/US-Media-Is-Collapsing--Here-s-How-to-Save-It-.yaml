    grants, have been coming in extra fast lately. Receiving them, me and my staff
    at the [Economic Hardship Reporting Project](https://economichardship.org/) feel
    like Lucille Ball grabbing the chocolates on the conveyor belt in that factory
    episode of *I Love Lucy*. The pace is picking up as publication closures and media
    layoffs push many into the world of full-time freelancing, where they compete
    for dwindling payouts against mounting competition. And as of last week, the *Intercept,*
    where my husband Peter Maass worked for ten years, has laid off fifteen of its
    staffers — including him. The media emergency just got even more personal.

    Drawing from participatory budgeting and inspired by economist Dean Baker, McChesney’s
    idea for reform is a local government process where citizens vote on how their
    county or city’s government media budget should be directed. McChesney proposes
    a news media voucher program — the Citizenship News Voucher — which, as he wrote
    in 2010, would make it so that “every American adult gets a $200 voucher she can
    use to donate government money to any nonprofit news medium of her choice. She
    will indicate her choice on her tax return. . . . A government agency, possibly
    operating out of the Internal Revenue Service, can be set up to allocate the funds
    and to determine eligibility.”

    covering the lives of some of the poorest Americans. Our organization, the Economic
    Hardship Reporting Project, is a version of this — only, given the absence of
    WPA-style policy programs of late, without the public funding part. We support
    hundreds of journalists, a good number of them financially struggling, to report
    on their experiences and communities and then copublish them nationally. But we
    are a staff of four, and this is a nonprofit that we raise money for each year.

    industry as far back in the ’90s — *the 1890s*, when sensationalist “yellow journalism”
    was replaced by the model of “objective” news, only under corporate ownership
    and for corporate profits. While some romanticize a time when newspaper reporters
    were working-class ink-stained wretches in visors who didn’t go to college and

    alternative: an independent public media system — “public” meaning that we fund

    In [an article](https://jacobin.com/2020/01/corporate-media-system-democracy)
