- en: 'The most common writerly punishment was to be burned at the stake. This practice
    extended at least four centuries, and *Books Fatal to Their Authors* provides
    dozens of examples. There was Lucilio Vanini, a sixteenth-century Italian philosopher
    who advocated atheism and changed his name to Julius Caesar — burned alive; Giordano
    Bruno, a Renaissance scholar who, among other heresies, suggested that the Bible
    was perhaps a work of dream interpretation — burned alive; Francois de Stabili,
    an Italian poet who used poor judgement in reading the horoscope of the Duke of
    Calabria’s wife — burned alive; and Savonarola, a beloved fifteenth-century Florentine
    preacher and revolutionary — strangled, then burned. The religious iconoclast
    Simon Morin was burned alive at the entrance to Notre Dame Cathedral while his
    followers were branded and enslaved. Jacopo Bonfadio was comparably lucky — his
    friends negotiated down the punishment, such that the philosopher was kindly beheaded,
    and *then* burned. The chemist Joseph Francis Borri fled Rome just in time, so
    that he was only burned in effigy, an experience that psychically transmitted
    a great chill: “Borri declared that he never felt so cold, [as] when he knew that
    he was being burned by proxy.”'

  zh: 作者最常见的惩罚是被烧死。这种做法至少延续了四个世纪，*致命的书*提供了数十个例子。有卢西利奥·瓦尼尼，一位16世纪的意大利哲学家，主张无神论并将自己的名字改为凯撒大帝
    — 被活活烧死；有文艺复兴学者朱尔达诺·布鲁诺，他除了其他异端之外，还暗示圣经也许是一部梦境解释的作品 — 被活活烧死；还有弗朗索瓦·德·斯塔比利，一位意大利诗人，在阅读卡拉布里亚公爵夫人的占星图时判断失误
    — 被活活烧死；还有萨沃纳罗拉，一位备受爱戴的15世纪佛罗伦萨传道士和革命家 — 被勒死，然后被烧死。宗教偶像破坏者西蒙·莫林被活活烧死在巴黎圣母院的入口处，而他的追随者则被烙上烙印并被奴役。雅各布·邦法迪奥算是比较幸运
    — 他的朋友们成功降低了刑罚，以至于这位哲学家被友好地斩首，*然后*才被烧死。化学家约瑟夫·弗朗西斯·博里及时逃离了罗马，因此他只被用来烧毁肖像，这一经历在心灵上传递了一种巨大的寒意：“博里声称他从未感到如此寒冷，[因为]当他知道自己正被代理烧毁时。”
