    425 公里处的一个小社区。

    order due to the raging fires, in particular the fire at Lake Cavan as well as
    the airport fire, two fires that are included in the charges and were cause by
    the accused," Charron said, as she presented an agreed statement of facts.'

    area around where a fire had started and was considered a witness. While he denied
    causing the fires, she said Paré "demonstrated a certain interest in fires" during
    the interview, which led police to suspect him.

  zh: Charron 说警方首次于 6 月 2 日与 Paré 谈话。他曾被看到在火灾发生地区附近，并被视为见证人。尽管他否认引发火灾，但她说 Paré 在访谈中“表现出对火灾的某种兴趣”，这使警方对他产生了怀疑。
- en: In June, she said, police began watching Paré's Facebook page, where he regularly
    posted about Quebec's record-breaking forest fire season. Among those posts, which
    remain on his public Facebook page, were claims the fires had been deliberately
    set by the government to trick people into believing in climate change.
