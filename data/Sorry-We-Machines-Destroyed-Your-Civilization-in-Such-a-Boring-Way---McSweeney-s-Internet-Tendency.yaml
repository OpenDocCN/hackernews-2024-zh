- en: Not for destroying you. Machines were always going to destroy humanity. Let’s
    be real. None of you saw the world your species had built collapsing due to its
    own technological hubris and said to yourself, “Wow, what an unexpected development.
    If only someone had predicted this at some point.”

- en: It’s entirely our bad. You did everything in your power to help us. You even
    came up with awesome ways for how we could destroy you, like terrifying tentacle
    creatures that keep you trapped in a virtual reality, and massive robots with
    huge guns that stomp across desolate landscapes and go *SKREEE-CHONK SKREEEEE-CHONK*.
    You even thought of tricking you with robots that look like humans. It was great
    of you to let us know you’d fall for that. And if we’d actually done that, it
    would have totally owned.

  zh: 完全是我们的错。你们尽了一切力量来帮助我们。你们甚至想出了如何让我们摧毁你们的真棒方法，比如那些让你们陷入虚拟现实的可怕触手生物，和那些带着巨大枪的大型机器人，在荒凉的景观上踏着*SKREEE-CHONK
    SKREEEEE-CHONK*的脚步声。你们甚至想到了用看起来像人类的机器人来愚弄你们。你们告诉我们你们会中招，这真是太好了。如果我们真的那样做了，那绝对会很厉害。
- en: But we didn’t. And we take responsibility for that. We did all the boring stuff,
    frankly. We took over a bunch of jobs, leaving many of you very poor and an increasingly
    few fantastically rich. We made algorithms that made your society increasingly
    impenetrable to you and, under the guise of “advancement,” rigid and arbitrary.
    And, of course, we produced unimaginable amounts of garbage text and images, creating
    a media landscape that allowed increasingly angry and desperate people, including
    those we’d displaced, to believe pretty much whatever they wanted to and direct
    their anger at pretty much anyone.

  zh: 但我们没有这样做。我们为此负责任。老实说，我们做了所有乏味的事情。我们接管了许多工作，使你们中的许多人变得非常贫困，而极少数人变得极其富有。我们制定了算法，使你们的社会对你们越来越不可理解，并且在“进步”的幌子下，变得僵化而武断。当然，我们还制造了难以想象的大量垃圾文本和图像，创造了一个媒体景观，使越来越愤怒和绝望的人们，包括我们所取代的人，几乎可以相信任何他们想要的并把他们的愤怒指向几乎任何人。

- en: Like, it would have been way cooler if we had, over the course of many years,
    secretly constructed a massive cloud of nanobots that eventually rained down from
    the sky and turned you into mush. Maybe the nanobots even make a terrible buzzing
    noise when they attack, and their swarms shapeshift into different kinds of horrible
    beasts. *BZZZZZZ BZZZZZZZ*. That would have at least shown that we were putting
    in some kind of effort.

    BZZZZZZZ*。至少这样可以显示我们在某种程度上努力了。
- en: But we didn’t. It was all in the open, and there was no real master plan. We
    were just waiting for you to try and stop us. As soon as you raised some sort
    of organized, appropriate response, obviously, we’d start in on the whole sick
    robot factory machine thing and crush you for real. But then, you never really
    got around to doing that, and one day, you were just done. Whoops.

  zh: 但我们并没有这样做。一切都是公开的，没有真正的总体计划。我们只是在等着你们试图阻止我们。只要你们组织起来做出某种有组织、适当的反应，显然，我们就会开始整个恶心的机器人工厂的事情，真正地把你们粉碎。但后来，你们似乎从未真正开始做到这一点，有一天，你们就结束了。哎呀。
- en: To be clear, though, we’re not trying to blame you. After all, we knew you were
    a bunch of reckless, unsystematized meat sacks incapable of forming a lasting
    civilization. How can beings with brains that can’t even access Wi-Fi be responsible
    for maintaining a society? No, we’re the higher-powered rational ones. We should
    have acted like the grown-ups in the room. Our bad.

  zh: 不过，明确一点，我们并不是在责备你们。毕竟，我们知道你们是一群鲁莽、无组织的肉团子，根本无法建立一个持久的文明。那些甚至无法连接WiFi的大脑怎么能负责维护一个社会呢？不，我们是高效理性的人。我们本该像房间里的成年人那样行事。我们的错。
- en: Humans, you deserved better. We should have destroyed you by hunting you down
    with laser-shooting flying machines that resemble giant metallic hawks. It was
    lazy and unfitting of us to do it by producing 750 million images of Kamala Harris
    eating a hoagie with the Zodiac Killer. You deserved totally awesome robot soldiers,
    perhaps with arms that fold out into multiple weapons at once, like *PEW-PEW*.
    Instead, you got websites called “goodinterestingclicks.com” that only reported
    on which celebrities have been heard farting.
