- en: This week, meet a reader we'll Regomize as "Aaron" who very recently worked
    for a managed services provider in Australia. One of his clients was an ad agency
    that he described as "insanely flashy and demanding."

  zh: 本周，我们认识一位我们将称为"Aaron"的读者，他最近在澳大利亚的一家托管服务提供商工作。他的一个客户是一家他描述为"极其浮华和苛刻"的广告公司。

- en: The agency also had an all-Apple environment – other than a SharePoint server
    that was used to store, among other things, plenty of uncompressed video and audio.
  id: totrans-split-9

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 该机构还拥有一个全Apple环境，除了一个用于存储大量未压缩视频和音频等内容的SharePoint服务器。
- en: SharePoint choked on those files, and users wanted faster access. So the agency
    built a file server to host that in-demand data.
  id: totrans-split-10
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: SharePoint对这些文件处理得很慢，用户希望能更快地访问。因此，机构建立了一个文件服务器来托管这些备受需求的数据。
- en: Except it wasn't really a server. It was a Mac Mini with some external USB drives.
    Data from SharePoint was stored on those drives in directories set up as SMB shares.
  id: totrans-split-11

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 但事实上这并不是一个真正的服务器。它是一个带有一些外部USB驱动器的Mac Mini。SharePoint的数据存储在这些驱动器上，设置为SMB共享的目录。
- en: This arrangement was obviously unstable, and the server would become unavailable
    if client devices updated macOS before the server. So every time Apple issued
    a new OS, Aaron rushed to update the server before the mismatch meant the ad agency
    lost access to its files.
  id: totrans-split-12
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 这种安排显然不稳定，如果客户设备在服务器之前更新了macOS，服务器将变得不可用。因此，每次苹果发布新的操作系统，Aaron都会赶在不匹配导致广告公司无法访问文件之前更新服务器。
- en: '"This was so common that we ended up creating an entire ticket stream just
    to monitor for macOS update emails as soon as Apple sent them," Aaron told On
    Call. But even with that early warning system in place, downtime was regular.'

  zh: '"这种情况如此普遍，以至于我们最终创建了一个完整的工单流程，专门监控苹果发送的macOS更新邮件，" Aaron 告诉On Call。但即使有了这种早期警告系统，停机时间仍然很常见。'

    crew whenever the server became unavailable, citing the enormous cost of outages.

- en: But the agency boss wouldn't buy a server, so Aaron and his colleagues lived
    in a horrible cycle of trying to keep the server updated, falling behind, fixing
    it, being berated by their rich client, recommending he pay for a new server,
    and being told "No."

  zh: 但广告公司老板不愿购买服务器，所以Aaron和他的同事们陷入了一个可怕的循环中：努力保持服务器更新，却总是落后，修复它，被富有的客户训斥，建议他为新服务器付费，却一再被拒绝。
- en: Until the day Aaron updated the Mac Mini, and the SharePoint directories on
    the external drives disappeared.

    recalled. "We could see the hardware ID for the external drives. But they would
    not mount."'

- en: The two sweated it out – literally, because this incident took place on a hot
    Australian summer day in an airless office without air conditioning – until they
    figured out the fresh macOS update wasn't loading USB drivers and therefore wouldn't
    talk to the external disks.
