- en: Two of the first-ever desktop computers have been found in storage boxes at
    Kingston University in London. A milestone in human achievement, the Q1 microprocessor
    computer was released more than half a century ago, and only one other is known
    to exist.

- en: The history of computers, and especially of what became the personal computer,
    is one of those topics that is extremely complicated to nail down. With the development
    of the silicon chip, the already fast-developing field of computers exploded as
    the technology jumped from major universities and corporations like IBM into the
    hands of small firms, hobbyists, and a new generation of young engineers.

- en: It's a story that makes for fascinating reading, but it's also more than a little
    frustrating because when it comes to the question of what was the first true desktop
    computer as we know it today, the answer has to be qualified with "it depends"
    and "even then, it's hard to nail down."

  zh: 这是一个引人入胜的故事，但也令人略感沮丧，因为当谈到今天我们所知的第一台真正的台式电脑时，答案必须带有“这取决于”和“即便如此，也难以确定”的限定词。
- en: Part of the problem is that the answer depends on how you define such a computer
    and what features it has to have. The other is that there are so many obscure
    computers from the 1970s that there's always another contender that's been overlooked.

  zh: 问题的一部分是答案取决于您如何定义这样一台计算机以及它必须具备哪些特性。另一个问题是，20世纪70年代有太多不知名的计算机，总有被忽视的竞争者。
- en: This is why unearthing the Q1 is such a surprise. Dating back to 1972, it's
    a fairly obscure machine with very few surviving examples and was rarely exported
    from the United States, so seeing one show up at Kingston in Britain is a bit
    of a shock. It wasn't even found tucked away in a dusty exhibit case; it was turned
    up by the environmental clean-up company Just Clear when it was doing routine
    work at the school and found the two computers in a couple of old boxes.

  zh: 这就是为什么发现Q1如此惊讶。追溯到1972年，它是一台相当不知名的机器，存世的例子很少，几乎未曾出口到美国之外，所以在英国金斯顿大学发现它显得有些震惊。它甚至不是被藏在灰尘满布的展柜中发现的；当清洁公司Just
    Clear在学校进行例行工作时，在几个旧箱子中发现了这两台计算机。
- en: Built by the Q1 Corporation in New York, the Q1 was arguably the first complete,
    standalone microcomputer with a built-in orange screen and keyboard, as was the
    later and similar Q1 Lite. It was capable of working with other Q1s as part of
    a network, interface with printers and hard drive memories, and was capable of
    such functions as acting as a computer terminal, word processing, and guided data
    entry.

  zh: 在纽约由Q1公司建造，Q1可以说是第一台完整的独立微型计算机，配备内置橙色屏幕和键盘，后来有类似的Q1 Lite。它能够与其他Q1组成网络，连接打印机和硬盘存储器，并能执行诸如充当计算机终端、文字处理和引导数据输入等功能。
- en: That's fairly impressive for such an early machine, which owed its flexibility
    and compact size to its Intel 8008 processor CPU instead of discrete TTL logic
    based on wired transistors. Even then, its performance was tiny by today's standards
    with only 16 kilobytes of memory and a processing speed of 800 kilohertz. There
    are car-key fobs that can outdo that now. However, that processor gives the Q1
    the claim to being the world's first true microcomputer two years before the better
    known MITS [Altair 8800](https://newatlas.com/altair-8800-clone/28136/).

  zh: 对于如此早期的机器来说，这是相当令人印象深刻的，它的灵活性和紧凑尺寸归功于其Intel 8008处理器CPU，而不是基于有线晶体管逻辑的离散TTL逻辑。即便如此，与今天的标准相比，其性能仍然微不足道，只有16千字节的内存和800千赫的处理速度。现在甚至有汽车钥匙扣可以超越它。然而，正是这款处理器使得Q1有资格成为世界上第一台真正的微型计算机，比更著名的MITS

- en: '"It is a real bonus being able to feature two Q1s – the world’s earliest microcomputers
    – at Kingston University," said Paul Neve, senior lecturer and course leader of
    the undergraduate computer science program. "The early pioneers in the 1970s and
    1980s laid the foundation for today’s everything device – the modern computer
    now so ubiquitous in everyday life. We rely on computers for our work, communication,
    productivity and entertainment, but without the early trailblazers none of these
    would exist. There would be no PCs, no Macs and no Apple or Android phones without
    Q1 Corporation, Sinclair, and Acorn."'
