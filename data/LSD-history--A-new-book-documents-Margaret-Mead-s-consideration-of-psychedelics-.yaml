- en: Back in her spiritual home after spending the last six months of 1953 in Manus,
    she felt refreshed, confident. She was already thinking through her book about
    her experience; *New Lives for Old *would be the title, and it would describe
    the Noise, an apocalyptic religious movement which spread through the island of
    Manus, which lies northeast of New Guinea, in the aftermath of World War II. In
    1947, a prophet had emerged on Manus who predicted a coming age of abundance,
    even immortality. But first, the old ways had to be cast out. Reports poured in
    of visionary experiences, trance states, even seizures. Hats of colonial officials
    were ritually burned, and a coming age of abundance was proclaimed. Mead found
    the Noise fascinating because she saw it as a prelude to other new cultural forms
    which she believed would appear elsewhere as a response to the rapid changes of
    the 20^(th) century—including in the United States. She saw the movement in relatively
    benign terms. True, it really *was *an apocalyptic cult, she wrote, complete with
    mystical “prophetic dreams” and the promise of “a utopia to be immediately established

    All human societies, everywhere, needed to learn to change in similar ways and
    with similar speed, avoiding the excesses of what she called “the apocalyptic
    cult aspect” but also recognizing that, as she later put it, “conscious intervention
    in the process of cultural evolution and human survival” was now the most urgent
    task that humanity faced. This was the goal of her science. And the things she
    saw and heard in the spring and summer of 1954 made her think that psychedelics
    might be part of it.

  zh: 对Mead来说，这不仅仅是在一个岛上的一个村庄中生存的问题。所有的人类社会，无论在任何地方，都需要以类似的方式和速度学习变革，避免她所称的“末世文化团体”过度现象，同时也要意识到，正如她后来所说的那样，“在文化进化和人类生存过程中的有意识干预”现在是人类面临的最紧迫任务。这是她科学研究的目标。1954年春夏她所看到和听到的事情使她认为迷幻药物可能是其中的一部分。
- en: 'Mead’s most important source for information about psychedelics at this time
    was Dr. Harold Abramson, an allergist and expert in “psychosomatic” illnesses.
    Among other things, Abramson had shared with her the results of an LSD trial that
    resulted in what he called “loss of fear of homosexuality”: a woman racked by
    anxiety over her suspicion that she might be a lesbian had, under the drug, resolved
    her fears. Mead, who was in a committed, yearslong relationship with fellow anthropologist
    [Rhoda Métraux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhoda_M%C3%A9traux) by this time,
    absorbed this information with great interest. Perhaps LSD could speed up the
    rate at which global culture adapted to rapid change. Perhaps, as she wrote to
    herself in June 1954, the drug could be a “short cut” for pulling society “away
    from mysticism and escape.”'

  zh: 在这段时间里，Mead获取有关迷幻药物的大部分信息的主要来源是哈罗德·阿布拉姆森博士，他是一位过敏学家和“心身症”专家。阿布拉姆森与她分享了一次LSD试验的结果，导致了他所称的“对同性恋失去恐惧”的情况：一名因怀疑自己可能是女同性恋而焦虑不安的女性在服用药物后解除了她的恐惧。Mead当时与同为人类学家的伴侣[Rhoda
    Métraux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhoda_M%C3%A9traux)保持了一段长达多年的稳定关系，她极感兴趣地吸收了这些信息。也许LSD可以加快全球文化适应快速变化的速度。也许正如她在1954年6月对自己所说的那样，这种药物可以成为“摆脱神秘主义和逃避”的“捷径”。
- en: It is worth pausing on this. If Mead had publicly backed psychedelics in the
    mid-1950s, history would have changed. A case could be made that with Einstein’s
    death in 1955, Mead became the world’s best-known living scientist.In that year
    ([by one measure](https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=Margaret+Mead%2CJonas+Salk%2CAlbert+Einstein%2CJ.+Robert+Oppenheimer%2CNiels+Bohr%2CLinus+Pauling%2CEnrico+Fermi&year_start=1930&year_end=1970&corpus=en-2019&smoothing=0))
    her name appeared in print more frequently than that of any other scientist alive
    at the time. Among dead ones, remarkably, she was within shooting distance of
    Charles Darwin and Isaac Newton. Even science-fiction novels were not free of
    her. In Robert Heinlein’s *Citizen of the Galaxy *(1957), the book’s orphaned
    protagonist is mentored by a space anthropologist named “Doctor Margaret Mader”
    who teaches him how to navigate the cultural shifts he faces as he skips from
    ship to ship, planet to planet.

  zh: 值得停下来思考。如果Mead在1950年代中期公开支持迷幻药物，历史可能会改变。可以说，随着1955年爱因斯坦的去世，Mead成为了当时全球最知名的活跃科学家之一。在那一年，她的名字（[按照一项统计](https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=Margaret+Mead%2CJonas+Salk%2CAlbert+Einstein%2CJ.+Robert+Oppenheimer%2CNiels+Bohr%2CLinus+Pauling%2CEnrico+Fermi&year_start=1930&year_end=1970&corpus=en-2019&smoothing=0)）在印刷品中的出现频率超过了当时其他任何科学家的名字。值得注意的是，她的名字甚至与查尔斯·达尔文和艾萨克·牛顿这些已故科学家的名字不相上下。甚至科幻小说也无法摆脱她的影响。在罗伯特·海因莱因的《银河公民》（1957）中，该书中的孤儿主人公由一位名为“玛格丽特·梅德尔博士”的太空人类学家指导，教导他如何在船只和行星之间航行并适应文化变迁。
- en: What drove Mead’s popularity was her ability to wed an urgent call to action—humanity
    needed to expand its “awareness,” its collective consciousness, in order to survive—with
    an implicit optimism. A young Carl Sagan was among Mead’s avid readers. As a student
    at the University of Chicago, he became fascinated with the ways her work “gave
    you a view of the arbitrariness of cultural mores, cultural systems.” Sagan was
    drawn to the “tremendous optimism” of “the idea that you weren’t jostled about
    by the winds of the world. That you could do something” to change the future.
    When an 18-year-old Sagan wrote his first piece of popular science writing, a
    radio script called “Ad Astra,” he dreamed of scoring an interview with Mead.

    of the abnormal—from trance states to traditional magical practices to the possibility
    of ESP. Mead mentored him, and in return he became what anthropologists call an
    “informant.” Mead had many contacts among psychedelic researchers at this time,

  zh: 不过，Mead的叙述中也透露出强烈的矛盾情绪。她写道，技术创新可能会促进更快的文化进化。但是，在同一段落中，当她将LSD与朝鲜战争中的洗脑相提并论时，她是有实际经验的。那时她已经了解到，任何能够改变自我感知的药物也可以重新定位为控制技术。Mead相信致幻剂的能力，正如她在1954年9月24日给Blum的信中所说，它可以是“整合和洞察的来源”，但前提是“在负责任的实验精神下进行”。
- en: In the end, Mead appears not to have taken LSD. On Nov. 8, 1954, she announced
    that her schedule had gotten too busy. “I think I’ll have to put off LSD possibly
    until the first of the year,” she wrote Booth, whom she’d asked to supervise her
    trip. On the same day, she told Harold Abramson the same thing. “I’ve not forgotten,”
    she added.

  zh: 最后，Mead似乎并没有使用LSD。在1954年11月8日，她宣布她的日程安排变得太忙碌。“我想我可能要推迟LSD的计划，可能要到年初才行，”她写信给Booth，请求他监督她的旅行。同一天，她告诉Harold
    Abramson同样的事情。“我没有忘记，”她补充道。
- en: Then, in January 1955, Mead decided to permanently postpone her LSD trip. There
    was more behind her decision than a crowded schedule. She had been reading studies
    and articles that showed psychedelic patients revealing truths they wanted to
    keep under wraps. In the same period, she was being investigated, once again,
    by the FBI—and was coming to the conclusion that she would move in with Rhoda
    Métraux.

  zh: 然后，在1955年1月，Mead决定永久推迟她的LSD之旅。这个决定背后有更多原因，而不仅仅是时间表太满。她一直在阅读关于致幻药患者透露他们希望保密的真相的研究和文章。在同一时期，她再次受到联邦调查局的调查，正在得出结论，她将与Rhoda
    Métraux搬到一起。
- en: As John D’Emilio [writes](https://www.google.com/books/edition/Sexual_Politics_Sexual_Communities/2dRotF250NwC?hl=en&gbpv=1&dq=%E2%80%9Cretreat%20to%20respectability%E2%80%9D%20emilio&pg=PA75&printsec=frontcover)
    in his history of gay rights in the 1950s, the years of 1953 and 1954 marked a
    “retreat to respectability” among LGBT activists who feared that the McCarthy-era
    prosecution of leftists would spill over into scrutiny of their own membership
    rolls. The retreat to respectability was, above all, a push to defend the principle
    that supposedly deviant sexual identities were in fact normal—by *behaving* normally
    in other domains of life.

  zh: 正如John D'Emilio在他关于1950年代同性恋权利历史的著作中所写的那样，在1953年和1954年，是LGBT活动家们“向尊严的撤退”的岁月，他们担心麦卡锡时代对左派的起诉将波及到他们自己的成员名单。向尊严的撤退主要是为了捍卫这样一个原则，即所谓的异性恋身份实际上是正常的——通过在生活的其他领域“正常行为”。
- en: Mead’s bisexuality had already nearly destroyed her career once before. In the
    summer of 1939, Ruth Benedict, another anthropologist who was a key mentor and
    longtime lover of Mead’s, was living among the Blackfeet people in Montana, and
    Mead was pregnant in New York City. Throughout June and July, letters flew back
    and forth between the two women about a disastrous love triangle in their group
    of friends. It came down to a test of loyalties, with Mead favoring one friend
    (the wife conducting an affair) and Benedict favoring the other (the angry husband,
    seeking a divorce for infidelity).

  zh: Mead的双性恋倾向曾经差点毁了她的事业。1939年夏天，另一位人类学家Ruth Benedict，是Mead的重要导师和长期情人，正在蒙大拿州的布莱克菲特人中生活，而Mead则怀孕在纽约市。整个六月和七月，两位女士之间来回飞舞的信件讲述了他们朋友圈中一场灾难性的三角恋情。最终形成了忠诚的考验，Mead支持一个朋友（一位妻子正在外遇），而Benedict支持另一个（愤怒的丈夫，寻求离婚以洗刷冤屈）。
- en: 'Then one day the scorned husband turned up outside Benedict’s remote cabin
    in Browning, Montana. He asked her to testify in his divorce trial. The wife responded
    with a chilling threat: If Benedict testified, she said, she would reveal Benedict’s
    relationship with Mead to newspapers. Mead panicked, placing a long-distance call
    to Benedict that appears to have threatened a break between them. In the end,
    Benedict stepped back from testifying, and Mead worked to smooth out the conflict
    in her own quietly effective way. But the fear remained.'

  zh: 然后有一天，被蔑视的丈夫出现在本尼迪克特位于蒙大拿州布朗宁的偏远小屋外。他要求她在他的离婚审判中作证。妻子以一种令人恐惧的威胁回应道：如果本尼迪克特作证，她会向报纸揭露本尼迪克特与米德的关系。米德感到恐慌，远距离打电话给本尼迪克特，似乎是在威胁她们之间的关系会破裂。最终，本尼迪克特选择了退缩，而米德则通过自己那种悄无声息但有效的方式来化解冲突。但恐惧仍然存在。
- en: In a letter to her loved ones from 1955, Mead directly referenced her life’s
    sphinxlike quality. “I have become increasingly conscious of the extent to which
    my life is becoming segmented, each piece shared with a separate person,” she
    wrote. “Since Ruth Benedict died [in 1948] there is no one alive who had read
    everything that I have written … Since the break up of my marriage, far less of
    my life has been shared with one person … It has not been by my choice of concealment
    that anyone of you have been left in ignorance of some part of my life which would
    seem, I know, of great importance.” Instead, this concealment had been “only from
    the exigencies of the mid-twentieth century when each one of us—at least those
    of us who are my age—seems fated for a life which is no longer sharable.” Her
    daughter, Mary Catherine, wrote that her mother kept a great many secrets, and
    “she clearly believed that the keeping of these secrets was correct and responsible
    behavior, a precondition to her availability to do the work that she felt was
    important.”

  zh: 在 1955 年写给她亲人的一封信中，米德直接提到了她生命的神秘质感。她写道：“我越来越意识到我的生活正在分段，每一部分都与不同的人分享。”“自从露丝·本尼迪克特（1948
    年去世）之后，没有活着的人读过我写的一切……自从我婚姻破裂以来，我的生活与一个人分享的时间少得多……这不是我选择隐藏让你们中任何一个人对我生活的某部分一无所知的原因，我知道这些部分非常重要。”相反，这种隐藏只是“来自二十世纪中期的需要，我们每一个人——至少是我们这个年龄段的人——似乎注定要过一种不再可以分享的生活。”她的女儿玛丽·凯瑟琳写道，她的母亲保守了许多秘密，“她明显认为保守这些秘密是正确和负责任的行为，是她能够从事她认为重要的工作的前提。”
- en: Margaret Mead took LSD seriously as a potential pathway for cultural evolution.
    But when she decided to move in with Métraux, her risk calculation changed. LSD,
    after all, was being used at that very moment in interrogations of suspected Soviet
    agents. She could not guarantee that she would not let something deeply personal,
    something secret, slip out during her trip.
