- en: The world of computer programming is in disorder and disorientation. Little
    progress has been made lately towards better understanding of the principles of
    computing. In spite of the existence of sophisticated languages, most programmers
    still work with octal, hexadecimal, or other cryptic dumps, with jumps and condition
    codes and other chaos promoting devices, worry about saving a bit here or there
    and a cycle now and then, and usually cannot bet a penny on whether a program
    written holds its promises or not. On the other hand, our vocabulary has expanded
    to unforeseeable dimensions. Interrupt, reentrant, time-sharing, modular, environment-adapted,
    paged, syntactic sugar, macro definable, dataset, push-down-controlled, micro-programmed,
    coercety and reference-to-union-of-MODES-and-PREFIX-structured-with-a-MODE-named-TAG-mode-row-of-row-ROWSETY-NONROW-slice,
    are examples of phrases not known 10 years ago. It is all part of a phantastically
    successful sales and habilitation campain of the emerging and confused computer
    and computer-science world. We witness the birth of an attempt by mankind to cope
    with the phenomenon of complexity, to specify and control logically complex processes
    handling vast amounts of complex structures of data. It is clear that such a new
    field of endeavour is prone to commercial exploitation. It is tempting and relatively
    easy to intrude nomansland and erect flags at exposed sites, but it is another
    matter to conquer and master the land, to cultivate it, develop a well-organised
    economy and to subject it to a sound and coherent system of laws.

  zh: 计算机编程的世界处于混乱和迷失之中。最近在理解计算原理方面几乎没有取得什么进展。尽管存在着复杂的语言，但大多数程序员仍然使用八进制、十六进制或其他晦涩的转储，带有跳转和条件代码等混乱推动设备，担心节省一点点这里或那里以及偶尔的周期，并且通常无法打赌一个便士，一个编写的程序是否能实现其承诺。另一方面，我们的词汇已经扩展到无法预见的维度。中断、可重入、时间共享、模块化、环境适应、分页、句法糖、宏定义、数据集、下推控制、微程序化、强制和引用-并-前缀-结构化-具有-MODE-命名的-标签-模式-行-的-行-ROWSETY-NONROW-片段，这些短语是10年前不为人所知的。这都是新兴的、混乱的计算机和计算机科学世界的一场梦幻般成功的销售和设立营地的战役的一部分。我们目睹了人类试图应对复杂现象，指定和逻辑控制处理大量复杂数据结构的复杂过程的诞生。显然，这样一个新的努力领域容易受到商业开发的影响。入侵无人之地并在暴露的地点竖立旗帜是诱人的，而且相对容易，但征服和掌控土地、开发一个良好组织的经济并将其纳入一套健全而连贯的法律体系则是另一回事。
- en: We have hastily intruded the world of complexity, have produced and sold complex
    equipment, have erected some spectacular land-marks, and clobbered the land with
    many billboards (our vocabulary), but are left with a feeling of being lost. As
    scientists, we have attempted to see beyond our immediate environment, to bring
    some order and orientation into the new land, to develop and discover its underlying
    basic laws. But so far, we haven't progressed very far. The prospectors are much
    faster and more ambitious, and with their new discoveries constantly overthrow
    our modest results.

- en: We have recognized that the cornerstone of the new field of complexity is that
    of specifying recipes and data structures on which our recipes operate. Such specifications
    must be given in terms of some logical system, which we have become accustomed
    to call <emph>language</emph>, or programming language. It is evident then, that
    our main effort in developing order and soundness concentrated on the design of
    languages. The language we speak influences profoundly our ways and powers to
    think and express ourselves. It should be clear, however, that the language is
    nevertheless only a tool, a medium, and that education must go beyond, far beyond,
    the teaching of language. I think, as scientists, we have concentrated too long
    on the refinement and sophistication of languages, so that we had to neglect the
    systematic education in their disciplined application, while the demands on applications
    programming continued to grow rapidly. Which are the results of the faux-pas?

  zh: 为了找出答案，我采访了几个人：
- en: 'First I met a scientist who since many years is engaged in problems of numeric
    computation and large scale number crushing. "What is your programming language?",
    I asked: "FORTRAN. It is the only tool, except pure machine code (which I abhore),
    that guarantees reasonable efficiency. Our main computations are floating point
    arithmetic and indexing. FORTRAN is <emph>sufficiently restrictive</emph> in its
    indexing facility so that extensive automatic optimization is possible inside
    loops. We are not very much interested in new and supposedly more powerful languages
    (such as ALGOL), because we have already such a large program library that any
    change-over would be out of question because of the necessarily large reprogramming
    effort."'

  zh: 首先，我遇到了一位长年从事数字计算和大规模数字压缩问题的科学家。“你们使用的编程语言是什么？”我问道：“FORTRAN。除了纯机器代码（我非常讨厌）之外，它是唯一保证合理效率的工具。我们主要进行浮点数算术和索引计算。FORTRAN的索引设施足够严格，以便在循环内进行广泛的自动优化。我们对于新的、据称更强大的语言（例如ALGOL）不太感兴趣，因为我们已经有了如此庞大的程序库，任何转换都是不可能的，因为必须进行大量的重新编程。”
- en: 'Secondly I went to see a staff member of the state administration. "What is
    your programming tool?" I asked again. "Well, there isn''t much choice but plowing
    through core dumps." "No no, I wasn''t referring to debugging aids, but to your
    programming <emph>language</emph>." "Just about a year ago we switched to COBOL,
    which allows us a greater degree of machine independence. Our main concern is
    that of record- and file structures, sorting and merging and input/output editing.
    COBOL''s capabilities in this respect are quite versatile. It is somewhat wordy,
    but one gets used to it, constructs quickly one''s own repertoire of abbreviations
    and learns to avoid those features that seem dangerous and mysterious. Moreover,
    COBOL is designed for the minds of our programmers: we think in terms of layouts
    of characters, and as on paper we use templates of celluloid, we define data structures
    which group and name our character strings.'

    “大约一年前，我们转换到了COBOL，这使我们能够更多地独立于机器。我们的主要关注点是记录和文件结构，排序和合并以及输入/输出编辑。COBOL在这方面的能力非常多样化。它有点啰嗦，但人们会很快习惯，快速构建自己的缩写词库，并学会避开那些看起来危险和神秘的特性。此外，COBOL是为我们的程序员设计的：我们用字符布局思考，就像在纸上使用纤维素模板一样，我们定义了将字符字符串分组和命名的数据结构。  '

    a new machine had just been installed. "Are your user's happy with the new facility?",
    I queried. "Mixed feelings! Particularly our Algol customers, of whom we had a
    fair share so far, are disgruntled. They all have to change their input/output
    sections from using FORTRAN to the new rules of the Knuthput. Many don't survive

    FORTRAN 改成 Knuthput 的新规则。很多人无法适应并回到了 FORTRAN。真是遗憾。
- en: 'Actually, all we would have needed to make Algol really a success here, would
    have been some minor additions to the range of data types: double precision, complex,
    and character. With the availability of character arrays we could define our own
    convenient standard I/O conversion procedures, and would not have to teach an
    abominally complicated mechanism, which everybody recognises as being artificially

- en: Fourthly, I visited a colleague who had been engaged in programming language
    design and teaching for quite a while, and I asked him about his present occupation.
    "I am discouraged! I thought I had recognized the short-comings of the commercially
    available languages; they provide no guidance to programming disciplines, and
    lack a logically coherent structure. Algol 60 had provided an answer and a solution.
    Unfortunately, it lacked some features which many practictioners badly need. It
    was relatively easy to remedy some defects and some defaults of Algol 60\. We
    had implemented such an extension of Algol; it contains the data types <emph>long
    real</emph>, <emph>complex</emph>, and character strings, along with one other
    major extension. But guess how many requests we have received for this system.
    None! Nobody is interested in a new language, particularly if it is not supported
    by the big manufacturers or has received the blessing of some standards committee.
    But I see no chances that either a big manufacturer or a committee will ever produce
    a language acceptable to our standards of clarity, simplicity, and rigor. As a
    result, everybody is designing his own language or software package. The old dream
    of a universal language is gone with the wind."

  zh: 第四，我拜访了一个从事编程语言设计和教学已经相当长时间的同事，询问了他目前的职业。“我感到沮丧！我以为我已经认识到了商业上可用语言的不足之处；它们没有提供编程学科的指导，并且缺乏逻辑一致的结构。Algol
    60 提供了一个答案和解决方案。不幸的是，它缺少了许多从业者急需的一些功能。相对容易纠正 Algol 60 的一些缺陷和默认值。我们实现了对 Algol 的扩展；它包含了数据类型<emph>long
    real</emph>、<emph>complex</emph>和字符串，以及另一个主要扩展。但猜猜我们收到了多少对这个系统的请求。没有！没有人对一种新语言感兴趣，特别是如果它不受大厂商支持或没有得到某个标准委员会的祝福的话。但我看不到大厂商或委员会会制定出符合我们对清晰、简单和严谨标准的语言的机会。结果，每个人都在设计自己的语言或软件包。一个通用语言的老梦想已经随风而逝。”
- en: 'In the fifth place, I met a friend engaged in hardware design. "I heard that
    you have recently switched to language design", I said: "Not exactly. We are still
    planning new machine organisations. But you have no idea what archaic methods
    are used in this field, and what cataclysmic blunders are committed as a result.
    My aim is to develop a tool which permits the precise specification of hardware
    down to the level of component interaction and pulse timing. But there simply
    is no convenient tool in which to express these problems. We will probably have
    to develop a language and program it interactively in PL/1; I can foresee that

    PL/1 中进行交互式编程；我可以预见到这将非常低效，我更希望有些汇编语言；但 PL/1 是公司政策！”
- en: In the last place, I went to ask for the opinion of a college teacher. "What
    language do you teach now?". "I have finally switched to PL/1", she said. "I have
    some pride in teaching in a clear and understandable way, and to organise the
    material in such a way that everything I say has its logical place, holds its
    validity with everything which will follow, makes use only of concepts previously
    introduced, and appeals to common sense. Yet there is now not a single lesson
    where I can avoid blushing and cursing myself for teaching something which contradicts
    my own principles and standards of scientific rigor, not a single lesson where
    there isn't a student asking a "why", and I have to reply "don't know, just accept

- en: '"So why have you chosen to teach PL/1?", I asked. "I used to teach Algol, where
    things weren''t ideal, but a lot better in those respects. But pressure was mounting
    to teach a language which the students could readily use after leaving the haven
    of school. Employers don''t ask "do you know the principles of programming?",
    but rather "do you speak FORTRAN?". In order to avoid making this step backwards,
    I chose PL/1, which first seemed to be a satistory compromise."'

- en: '"And what do you think of the new Algol?", I continued. "New Algol?" I pulled
    out my copy of the draft report on Algol 68 and showed it to her. She fainted.

    its members met regularly once or twice a year. The meetings followed a standard

    to work on a solution until next time. The rest of the members dispersed and forgot
    about Algol. Finally the saviours had worked themselves so deeply into subject
    matter, that the rest couldn''t follow and understand their thoughts and terminology
    and longer. Meetings became principally tutorials. But even this didn''t avert
    that everyone started to speak a different language. What hampered progress even
    more, was the fact that a goal had never been specified with sufficient clarity.
    The implied and rather vague goal was the specification of a universal language,
    a sensible goal in 1960, even 1964, but an utopia in 1968; a goal which, if pursued
    faithfully, invariably lead towards a monster language, a species of which there
    already exists a sample hardly worth nor possible to compete with. Having proved

    the renunciation of the immodest ambition to erect another monument or mile stone
    along the road of progress in computer sciences. It would have required a shift
    from a fanatic perfectionism in formal definition methods towards honest consideration
    of pragmatics. It would have required the concentration of effort on a much more
    restricted goal. Of the people I visited before, I believe we should first have
    served the last one, the teacher. By defining and making available a simple, logcially
    and pragmatically sound, appealing and efficiently implementable language, fully
    equipped with an official stamp, an enormous service could have been made to the
    computing world at large. People trained on such a language would have carried
    over their acquired working habits, their ways of thinking and designing and their
    standards of quality into their places of research, development, application,
    and education in computing. Such a language we had expected from the illustrious
    gremium WG 2.1 a few years ago. The emphasis on a simple and didactically appealing
    language would automatically have resulted in the development of a nucleus of
    a self-extendible language, perhaps the most promising approach of development.
    Such a language provides a facility for programmers to define data structure patterns,
    and operators which apply to these patterns. The crucial point here is that the
    language nucleus must be of utmost simplicity, and every aspect of the nucleus
    language must be very efficiently implementable on any reasonable computer organisation.
