- en: Meanwhile, neighborhoods such as the Western Addition, Mission, Russian Hill
    and Noe Valley are chock-full of homes built before everyday people owned automobiles,
    according to San Francisco Heritage President Woody LaBounty. Many of these homes,
    constructed pre-1910, were built to have a half story of open space underneath
    to get the house off the ground and away from the muddy, sandy streets of the
    era.

  zh: 与此同时，旧金山西部附近的社区，如Mission、俄罗斯山和诺伊谷，据旧金山遗产总裁Woody LaBounty称，这些社区充满了普通人拥有汽车之前建造的房屋。许多这些建于1910年前的房屋设计有一个半层开放空间，目的是将房屋抬高，远离当时泥泞、沙质的街道。
- en: Once automobile ownership became commonplace, companies began turning those
    empty basement-level half-stories into garages, explaining why so many San Francisco
    garages have steep, declining driveways and shallow roofs, according to LaBounty.
    About a third of San Francisco homes were built before garages were widespread,
    LaBounty estimates.

  zh: 一旦汽车普及，公司们开始将那些空荡荡的地下半层转变为车库，这解释了为什么许多旧金山的车库都有陡峭的下坡车道和浅屋顶，LaBounty说。据LaBounty估计，大约三分之一的旧金山房屋是在车库普及之前建造的。
- en: Many of the driveway parkers The Standard spoke with had alternative uses for
    their garage space. One teen, who declined to give their name, explained that
    their family had converted the garage into a relaxation zone so they could have
    a refuge from their younger siblings. David Turner, meanwhile, said he had a home
    gym set up in the garage, outfitted with a bench press, squat rack, heavy bag
    and pullup bar.

  zh: 许多停在车道上的驾车者告诉The Standard，他们的车库空间有其他用途。一位不愿透露姓名的十几岁青少年解释说，他们的家庭将车库改造成一个休闲区，这样他们就能有一个远离年幼兄弟姐妹的庇护所。与此同时，David
    Turner表示，他在车库里搭建了一个家庭健身房，配备了卧推架、深蹲架、沉重拳击袋和引体向上杆。
