    efforts at integration. In addition to the American Academy for Oral Systemic
    Health, the [National Network of Healthcare Hygienists](https://www.healthcarehygienists.org/),

    by putting dental and medical services under one roof. In December 2023, Pacific
    Dental Services opened a clinic, Culver Smiles Dentistry, in a space shared with
    a medical practice. It’s the first of 25 planned dental-medical practices that
    will operate through a partnership between [MemorialCare](http://www.memorialcare.org/),
    a big Southern California health system, and Pacific Dental.

    now, and health care is realizing that the mouth is the gateway to so much of
    our overall health.”
