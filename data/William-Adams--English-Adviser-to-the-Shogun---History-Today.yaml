- en: In 1600 a Dutch galleon arrived on the shores of a small fief on Kyushu, the
    westernmost of Japan’s four main islands. It was the first Dutch ship to reach
    Japan. Among the crew was an English navigator, William Adams, who managed to
    gain the trust of Tokugawa Ieyasu, a powerful warlord who became a shogun (the
    military leader of the samurai caste) in 1603\. Adams eventually rose to the rank
    of Hatamoto, the shogun’s direct retainer. How did an English navigator come to
    serve the shogun? To answer this, we must first look at the situation in Japan
    at the time and the policies of Ieyasu.

  zh: 1600年，一艘荷兰大帆船抵达了九州一个小封地的海岸，这是日本四大岛中最西端的一个。这是第一艘到达日本的荷兰船。船员中有一名英国航海家威廉·亚当斯，他设法获得了德川家康的信任，这位强大的军阀后来成为了将军（武士阶层的军事领袖）于1603年。亚当斯最终升至旗本的地位，即将军的直接仆从。一个英国航海家如何成为将军的顾问？要回答这个问题，我们必须首先看看当时日本的情况以及家康的政策。
- en: 'By 1600 Japan had endured several centuries of warfare, known as the Sengoku
    period (Sengoku means ‘the country at war’). Originally ruled by the emperor in
    Kyoto, from the 12th century the shogunate had ruled the country, leaving the
    emperor with only nominal power. However, as the influence of the Ashikaga shoguns
    waned the country descended into chaos, with numerous warlords vying for supremacy.
    In the middle of the 16th century, great unifiers appeared: first Oda Nobunaga
    and then Toyotomi Hideyoshi. The latter succeeded in uniting the country under
    his own rule, but died in 1598, leaving an infant son, Hideyori, and a council
    of five regents to govern until Hideyori came of age.'

  zh: 到1600年，日本经历了几个世纪的战争，被称为战国时期（战国意为“战乱国家”）。最初由京都的天皇统治，从12世纪起，幕府统治了这个国家，使得天皇只保留了名义权力。然而，随着足利幕府的影响力衰落，国家陷入混乱，许多军阀争夺统治权。在16世纪中期，出现了伟大的统一者：首先是织田信长，然后是丰臣秀吉。后者成功地统一了国家，但在1598年去世，留下一个婴儿儿子秀赖和五名摄政来统治，直到秀赖成年。
- en: 'By far the most powerful of the regents was Tokugawa Ieyasu. After a decisive
    battle that removed his major opponents, he founded the Tokugawa Shogunate and
    was appointed as shogun. In this capacity he was able to rule the country alone.
    International relations became an important concern of his rule. Portugal had
    been trading with Japan since the 1540s. Through the influence of the Jesuits,
    who accompanied the Portuguese merchants and had some success in spreading their
    gospel, they had obtained a safe harbour at Nagasaki, on the west coast of Kyushu.
    Every year a huge Portuguese carrack sailed from Macau to Nagasaki carrying almost
    a year’s worth of Chinese silk goods for Japan’s clothing industry. To prevent
    Japanese pirates, Chinese were banned from sailing to Japan and Japanese from
    entering China. This played into the hands of the Portuguese: they had a virtual
    monopoly on the import of goods into Japan and were thus able to control prices.'

  zh: 到目前为止，统治者中最强大的是德川家康。在消灭了主要对手的一场决定性战斗之后，他建立了德川幕府，并被任命为将军。在这一职务上，他能够独自统治这个国家。国际关系成为他治理的重要关注点。自1540年代以来，葡萄牙一直与日本进行贸易。通过耶稣会士的影响，他们伴随葡萄牙商人并在传播其福音方面取得了一定成功，他们在九州西海岸的长崎获得了一个安全的港口。每年，一艘巨大的葡萄牙大帆船从澳门驶向长崎，运载着几乎一年的中国丝绸商品，供日本的服装业使用。为防止日本海盗，中国人被禁止航行到日本，日本人被禁止进入中国。这符合葡萄牙的利益：他们几乎垄断了进口商品到日本，并因此能够控制价格。
- en: Aware that such a foreign monopoly was not in his country’s interests Ieyasu
    tried to reduce his dependence on Portuguese traders. He sent junks to Patani
    and other ports in East Asia to buy Chinese silk and even began negotiations with
    the Spanish in the Philippines. The junks were unable to buy large quantities,
    though, and the Spanish were more interested in sending missionaries than in trading.
    This was all the more worrying as Ieyasu was concerned about the growing influence
    of Christians in his territories. It was at this crucial moment that Adams arrived
    in Japan.

  zh: 意识到这样的外国垄断并不符合他国家的利益，家康试图减少对葡萄牙商人的依赖。他派遣船只前往马六甲及其他东亚港口购买中国丝绸，甚至开始与菲律宾的西班牙人进行谈判。然而，这些船只未能购买大量商品，而西班牙人更感兴趣的是传教而非贸易。这对家康来说更加令人担忧，因为他担心基督教在他领土上的影响日益增强。正是在这个关键时刻，亚当斯抵达了日本。
- en: During the war with the Iberian countries (c.1567-1648) the Dutch were deprived
    of the Asian products they had been buying in Lisbon and so began to send fleets
    to Asia to obtain these products directly. Adams was one of several Englishmen
    to sail with these fleets, leaving Rotterdam in 1598\. He had served in the queen’s
    fleet and had been employed by the Barbary Company for about ten years, making
    him a perfect candidate to navigate one of the five Dutch ships. Yet even with
    an experienced crew the voyage proved disastrous. After two years of misery, only
    Adams’ ship reached Japan. Of a crew of 100, only 18 survived.

  zh: 在与伊比利亚国家的战争期间（大约1567-1648年），荷兰人被剥夺了他们在里斯本购买的亚洲产品，因此开始派舰队直接前往亚洲获取这些产品。亚当斯是几名与这些舰队一同航行的英国人之一，于1598年离开鹿特丹。他曾在女王的舰队服役，并在巴巴里公司工作了约十年，使他成为驾驶五艘荷兰船只之一的完美候选人。然而，即使有经验丰富的船员，这次航行也证明是灾难性的。经过两年的苦难，只有亚当斯的船到达了日本。100名船员中，只有18人幸存。
- en: When the Portuguese learned that their enemies had reached Japan they petitioned
    the magistrates to execute the remaining crew members as pirates. But Ieyasu refused
    and had Adams and Jan Joosten Lodenstein, a Dutch crewman, brought to Osaka for
    questioning. Far from having them killed, he made the two men his advisers on
    international affairs.

  zh: 当葡萄牙人得知他们的敌人已经到达日本后，他们向执法官请愿，要求处死剩余的船员，称他们为海盗。但家康拒绝了，并将亚当斯和荷兰船员扬·约斯滕·洛登斯坦带到大阪审问。远非处死，他让这两人成为他的国际事务顾问。
- en: It seems that Adams’ answers to Ieyasu’s questions (preserved in the letters
    Adams wrote afterwards) made a good impression. At their first meeting Ieyasu
    asked, through a Portuguese-speaking interpreter, where Adams was from and what
    had prompted him to travel so far. Adams showed Ieyasu England on a map and told
    him that his country desired friendship through trade with all the kings of Asia.
    Ieyasu asked if England was at war. Yes, Adams replied, with Spain and Portugal,
    and at peace with all other nations. Asked how they had come to Japan, Adams showed
    the map again and explained that they had sailed through the Strait of Magellan;
    at first this made Ieyasu suspicious because he did not know the Earth was round.
    In the end, Adams advocated free trade and a win-win relationship between friendly
    nations – music to the ears of Ieyasu, who wanted to end the Portuguese monopoly.
    After three meetings, Adams was released, but was not allowed to leave the country.
    Ieyasu employed him to learn about the world and mathematics.

  zh: 看来亚当斯对家康问题的回答（后来他写信保留了这些回答）给家康留下了良好的印象。在他们的第一次会面中，家康通过一名会讲葡萄牙语的翻译问亚当斯从哪里来，以及是什么促使他如此远行。亚当斯在地图上指出了英格兰，并告诉他，他的国家希望通过与亚洲所有国王的贸易建立友谊。家康问道，英格兰是否处于战争状态。亚当斯回答说，与西班牙和葡萄牙交战，与其他国家保持和平。家康问他们是如何来到日本的。亚当斯再次展示地图，并解释说他们穿过了麦哲伦海峡；起初这让家康感到怀疑，因为他不知道地球是圆的。最后，亚当斯提倡自由贸易和友好国家之间的双赢关系——这正是家康乐于听到的，他希望结束葡萄牙的垄断。经过三次会面后，亚当斯被释放，但不被允许离开日本。家康雇用他来了解世界和数学。
- en: In his advisory capacity, Adams was instrumental in establishing a Dutch and
    English trading post at Hirado, a small island off the north-west coast of Japan,
    effectively breaking the Portuguese monopoly. With the help of the other survivors
    from his ship, he also built two small galleons for Ieyasu. Ieyasu’s shipwrights
    were able to acquire Western shipbuilding techniques, which they applied to the
    construction of sea-going junks, giving a new impetus to Japanese expansion in
    the East Asian market. Adams also acted as a broker for the shogun in the purchase
    of Western cannon, lead cannonballs and iron sand for the manufacture of Japanese
    swords. The cannon proved to be one of the decisive factors in the Siege of Osaka
    (1614-15), in which Ieyasu defeated Hideyori and established the Tokugawa supremacy
    that would last for 250 years.

  zh: 作为顾问，亚当斯在平戸岛上成功建立了荷兰和英国的贸易站，有效打破了葡萄牙的垄断。他还与自己船上的其他幸存者一起为家康建造了两艘小型的大帆船。家康的造船工匠得以学习西方的造船技术，并将其应用于造海船，从而推动了日本在东亚市场的扩展。亚当斯还充当幕府的经纪人，协助购买西方的大炮、铅弹和铁砂，用于制造日本刀。这些大炮被证明是1614-15年大坂围城战的决定性因素之一，家康在此战中击败了秀赖，确立了将持续250年的德川霸权。
- en: 'Jacques Specx, the head of the Dutch trading post, noted in his diary of 1611:
    ‘This Mr Adams is esteemed by Ieyasu as a prince or potentate because of his learning
    and sincerity. He is entitled to converse directly and intimately with his highness.
    This is a great help to us, as few people are allowed to do so.’ Ieyasu was keen
    to employ people of ability and honesty, even if they were not members of the
    samurai caste. It seems that he favoured Adams because of his knowledge and impartiality,
    even trying, in 1616, to keep him in the country when Adams asked to leave.'

  zh: 荷兰贸易站负责人雅各布·斯贝克斯在其1611年的日记中写道：“由于他的学识和诚信，这位亚当斯先生在家康眼中如同一位亲王或有权势的人物。他有资格与其高度直接和亲密地交流。这对我们是一大帮助，因为很少有人被允许这样做。”家康热衷于雇佣具有能力和诚实的人，即使他们不是武士阶层的成员。看来他因亚当斯的知识和公正而青睐他，甚至在1616年，当亚当斯请求离开时，还试图留他在国内。
- en: After Ieyasu’s death in 1616, his son Hidetada took over and surrounded himself
    with his own favourites. He followed a very different course from his father.
    Conservative by nature, he reversed Ieyasu’s policy of free trade. Above all,
    he wanted to consolidate Tokugawa rule and eliminate all foreign influence. This
    proved fatal to Adams’ position. With his special status as a retainer of the
    shogun, Adams was still allowed to travel freely in Japan, unlike other foreigners.
    He used this privilege to help the English trading post, but a series of incidents
    made it clear that the power he once had under Ieyasu’s rule was no more. Only
    four years after Ieyasu’s death, Adams himself died, aged 56, in Hirado, far from
    the capital.

  zh: 伊达家康于1616年去世后，他的儿子秀忠接任，并围绕自己聚集了自己喜欢的人。他的政策与父亲截然不同。因其天性保守，他颠覆了家康推行的自由贸易政策。最重要的是，他希望巩固德川统治，并消除所有外国影响。这对亚当斯的处境造成了致命影响。凭借其作为幕府家臣的特殊身份，亚当斯仍然被允许在日本自由行动，而其他外国人则不然。他利用这一特权来帮助英国贸易站，但一系列事件表明，他在家康统治下曾经拥有的权力已经不存在了。仅仅四年后，亚当斯本人在远离首都的平戸去世，享年56岁。
