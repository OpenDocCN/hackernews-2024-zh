  zh: OpenAI非营利董事会委托的独立调查发现，CEO山姆·阿尔特曼的行为“并不需要被解雇”。在[幸存](/2023/11/29/23982046/sam-altman-interview-openai-ceo-rehired)于去年秋天的董事会政变后，他现在将重新加入董事会。
- en: In [a press release](https://openai.com/blog/review-completed-altman-brockman-to-continue-to-lead-openai),
    board chair Bret Taylor said the law firm WilmerHale interviewed board members,
    employees, and reviewed “more than 30,000 documents” to reach the conclusion that
    Altman and co-founder Greg Brockman “are the right leaders for OpenAI.”

  zh: 在[一则新闻发布](https://openai.com/blog/review-completed-altman-brockman-to-continue-to-lead-openai)中，董事长布雷特·泰勒表示，律师事务所WilmerHale对董事会成员、员工进行了采访，并审查了“超过30,000份文件”，以得出结论，认为阿尔特曼和联合创始人格雷格·布罗克曼“是OpenAI的合适领导人”。
- en: 'In addition to Altman, Taylor [also announced](https://openai.com/blog/openai-announces-new-members-to-board-of-directors)
    three more OpenAI board members: Sue Desmond-Hellmann, the former CEO of the Bill
    and Melinda Gates Foundation; Nicole Seligman, a former legal executive at Sony;
    and Fidji Simo, the CEO of Instacart. They will join Taylor, Altman, Quora CEO
    Adam D’Angelo, and Larry Summers in governing OpenAI’s nonprofit parent company.'

  zh: 除了阿尔特曼外，泰勒还[宣布](https://openai.com/blog/openai-announces-new-members-to-board-of-directors)了另外三名OpenAI董事会成员：苏·德斯蒙德-赫尔曼，比尔和梅琳达·盖茨基金会的前首席执行官；尼科尔·塞利格曼，索尼的前法务主管；以及Fidji
    Simo，Instacart的首席执行官。他们将与泰勒、阿尔特曼、Quora的CEO亚当·丹吉洛和拉里·萨默斯一起管理OpenAI的非营利母公司。
- en: For those seeking to better understand why Altman was suddenly fired from his
    perch last fall, OpenAI’s public summary of the WilmerHale investigation is frustratingly
    light on details. The law firm said the board believed it “would mitigate internal
    management challenges” by firing Altman suddenly, and that the “decision did not
    arise out of concerns regarding product safety or security, the pace of development,
    OpenAI’s finances, or its statements to investors, customers, or business partners.”

  zh: 对于那些希望更好地理解为什么阿尔特曼去年秋天突然被解雇的人，OpenAI对WilmerHale调查的公开摘要内容则明显缺乏细节。该律师事务所表示，董事会认为通过突然解雇阿尔特曼“可以缓解内部管理挑战”，而这个“决定并非出于对产品安全性或安全性、开发速度、OpenAI财务状况或其对投资者、客户或商业伙伴的声明的担忧。”

- en: 'The summary of the investigation uses the same vague language that OpenAI’s
    previous board [published to justify its decision to fire Altman](/2023/11/17/23965982/openai-ceo-sam-altman-fired):
    that the incident, which I’m told OpenAI employees refer to as “The Blip,” was
    a “consequence of a breakdown in the relationship and loss of trust between the
    prior Board and Mr. Altman.” WilmerHale also found that the prior board moved
    “without advance notice to key stakeholders, and without a full inquiry or an
    opportunity for Mr. Altman to address the prior Board’s concerns.”'

  zh: 调查摘要使用了与OpenAI之前的董事会发布的相同模糊语言，以证明其解雇阿尔特曼的决定的正当性：我被告知OpenAI员工称之为“闪失”的事件，是“由于之前董事会与阿尔特曼先生之间关系的崩溃和信任丧失所致。”WilmerHale还发现，之前的董事会“在未提前通知关键利益相关者的情况下行动，并且没有进行全面调查或给阿尔特曼先生解决之前董事会担忧的机会。”
- en: On a short video call with reporters Friday, Altman apologized for believing
    that “a former OpenAI board member was harming OpenAI through their actions” but
    declined to go into more detail. It has been widely reported that he tussled with
    [ex-board member Helen Toner](/2023/12/7/23992302/openai-is-low-on-toner) over
    an academic paper she co-authored that was critical of OpenAI’s approach to safety,
    and that others expressed concerns about the conflicts of interest posed by Altman’s
    other investments.

    and chief scientist Ilya Sutskever, who played a key role in the failed coup but
    changed sides when the [majority of OpenAI employees threatened to quit](/2023/11/20/23968988/openai-employees-resignation-letter-microsoft-sam-altman)

  zh: 在与记者的通话中，Altman 坐在 Bret Taylor 旁显得很开心。在某个时刻，他被问及联合创始人兼首席科学家 Ilya Sutskever 的雇佣状况，后者在
    OpenAI 大多数员工威胁要辞职（如果 Altman 不回归的话）时在一场失败的政变中扮演了关键角色，但后来改变了立场。
- en: Sutskever has since gone quiet, leading to questions about his involvement with
    the company going forward. On the call, Altman said there was “nothing to announce”
    but that “Ilya is awesome,” and “I hope we work together for the rest of our careers.”
