    for Heterodox Academy, Sean and Jonathan Haidt proposed that a “new dynamic” was
    emerging on American college campuses and that current college students were more
    hostile toward freedom of speech than their older counterparts. Sean and Haidt
    proposed that this “new dynamic” represented a set of “politically correct” viewpoints
    that made it harder for students and faculty who dissented from these viewpoints
    to express themselves.

  zh: 六年前，在Heterodox Academy的一个[三部曲](https://heterodoxacademy.org/blog/skeptics-are-wrong-about-campus-speech/)中，肖恩和乔纳森·海德提出，美国大学校园正在出现一种“新动态”，目前的大学生对言论自由更为敌视，比他们的老一辈同学更为敌视。肖恩和海德提出，这种“新动态”代表了一套“政治正确”的观点，使得那些与这些观点不同意的学生和教职员工更难表达自己。
- en: The “new dynamic” hypothesis was [based](https://heterodoxacademy.org/blog/the-skeptics-are-wrong-part-2/)
    on an analysis of FIRE’s Campus Disinvitation Database (now the [Campus Deplatforming
    Database](https://www.thefire.org/research-learn/campus-deplatforming-database))
    as well as data from five different surveys. The data demonstrated that in 2016
    and 2017, student participation in disinvitation attempts and substantial event
    disruptions was at record levels and was increasingly targeting conservative expression.
    It also showed that college students thought their campuses were stifling the
    expression of controversial ideas (which on many campuses, were likely to be conservative,
    or, at least, *deemed* to be conservative, what Greg calls “[fasco-casting](https://youtu.be/r-jkyLYNSCY?feature=shared)”).

    was six, in 2006\. Now contrast this record with what’s happened over the past
    decade, where 81 substantial event disruptions have already been recorded, including
    a peak of 21 last year. This is an average of roughly eight substantial event
    disruptions a year — five times the average from 1998-2013.

    being escorted out of a speaking event by police at the University of New Mexico

    During that event, students exposed shirts featuring photos of Palestinians killed
    in Gaza since the start of the Israel-Hamas war and began shouting Hammer down.
    When an administrator informed the students that their actions violated university
    policy, the administrator was also shouted down. The students eventually left,
    but continued to bang on the wall outside the room throughout the rest of the
    talk.

    attempts, they do represent an effort to shut down in-progress events and reflect
    the general climate against free speech on campus. For those reasons, attempted

    at Brown University in 2008 by storming the stage and throwing a pie at Friedman,
    claiming that Friedman's views on environmentalism are a "sham” (Friedman cleaned
    himself off and resumed his speech). This data also includes students loudly booing
    then-Governor [Arnold Schwarzenegger](https://www.thefire.org/research-learn/campus-deplatforming-database#campus-deplatforming/campus-deplatforming-details/65c1511779db8200391eafe6/)

    and a Georgia State student during the Q&A portion of Crucet’s talk on white privilege,
    which was followed by other students shouting, yelling, and chanting over Crucet.
    Later in the evening, students burned copies of Crucet's newly released book,
    "Make Your Home Among Strangers," about a Hispanic girl who grows up in a predominantly
    white environment. Some students also gathered outside Crucet’s hotel, forcing
    her to move to another one.

    Your Home Among Strangers》，这本书讲述了一个在主要是白人的环境中长大的拉丁裔女孩。还有些学生聚集在Crucet住的酒店外，迫使她不得不搬到另一家酒店。
