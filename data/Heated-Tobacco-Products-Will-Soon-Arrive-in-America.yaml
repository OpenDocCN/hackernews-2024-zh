- en: The first time I saw an IQOS, the innovative tobacco product on which Philip
    Morris International is betting billions of dollars to replace cigarettes, was
    at a wedding in 2016\. A friend had excitedly pulled me outside to try this new
    device that had enabled him to finally kick his smoking habit. Not quite a cigarette
    because it didn't ignite, not quite a vape because it used actual tobacco, supposedly
    less toxic than conventional cigarettes but satisfying enough to compete with
    them, it seemed that this heated tobacco might be the future of nicotine.

  zh: 第一次看到 IQOS 这一创新的烟草产品，它是菲利普·莫里斯国际公司押注数十亿美元取代香烟的产品，是在 2016 年的一场婚礼上。一个朋友激动地拉着我到外面去尝试这个新装置，他因此终于戒掉了吸烟的习惯。它不完全是香烟，因为它不燃烧，也不完全是电子烟，因为它使用的是真正的烟草，据说比传统香烟毒性更小，但足够令人满意，可以与它们竞争，这似乎表明这种加热烟草可能是尼古丁的未来。

    U.S., so my friend sourced his supply via discreet shipments from a connection
    in Europe. Seven years later, despite its availability in more than 60 other countries,
    the technology is still on hold in the United States. First regulation by the
    Food and Drug Administration slowed its arrival, then the rollout of IQOS was

- en: Japan provides an unlikely model for tobacco policy. The country tends to be
    more tolerant of smoking than its Western peers; it has high rates of smoking
    among men, and its government participates directly in the cigarette trade through
    its partial ownership of Japan Tobacco, the country's largest manufacturer of
    cigarettes. It therefore comes as a surprise that Japan is experiencing a dramatic

- en: '"Japan has accomplished spectacular things in a very short period of time with
    regard to cigarette smoking," says David Sweanor, an adjunct professor of law
    at the University of Ottawa with decades of experience in tobacco regulation.
    Sweanor co-authored a [study published in 2020](https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/17/10/3570)
    that analyzed Japanese tobacco sales data from 2011 to 2019\. Japan forbids the
    sale of e-cigarettes but allows heated tobacco, making it an ideal test case for
    measuring the impact of products like IQOS and similar competitors including [Ploom](https://www.ploom.co.uk/en)
    and [Glo](https://www.discoverglo.com/). Sweanor''s study concluded that Japan''s
    decline in cigarette sales accelerated massively with the introduction of heated
    tobacco products, from an annual rate of around 3 percent before 2016 to around
    11 percent in years after.'

    Sweanor的研究得出结论，随着加热烟草产品的推出，日本香烟销售的下降速度大幅加快，从2016年之前的年均约3%增加到以后的约11%。
- en: 'This downward trend has continued, nearly halving cigarette sales in just seven
    years: from 180 billion cigarettes sold nationwide in 2015 to under 100 billion

- en: Why is no one talking about Japan? "I think it's a really good indication of
    one of the problems in the field known as tobacco control," says Sweanor. He suggests

    By that standard, Japan is a disappointment. Although male smoking rates have
    declined substantially since the turn of the century, when nearly half of men
    in Japan smoked, the habit persists in about a quarter of Japanese men. The current
    dramatic decline in cigarette sales is only partially caused by quitting or abstinence
    from nicotine; much of it is due to consumers buying heated tobacco instead. That
    switch may well avert a substantial portion of smoking-related deaths, but harm
    reduction is a difficult case to make in a field as ideologically driven as tobacco
    control.

- en: Even among experts who are receptive to harm reduction, evaluating the impact
    of heated tobacco is more nuanced than gross sales figures suggest. Industry players
    have invested heavily in research to show that noncombustible products present
    much lower exposure to toxic substances than conventional cigarettes. This is
    a plausible claim backed up by reams of documentation, sufficient to convince
    even the FDA to [authorize](https://www.fda.gov/media/139797/download) IQOS for
    sale in the United States and allow it to be marketed with claims of reduced exposure
    to harmful toxicants compared to cigarettes. (For a thorough comparison of emissions

    perplexing aspect of regulation, of course, is the individual versus the population
    level," says Geoffrey Fong, principal investigator at the International Tobacco
    Control Policy Evaluation Project at the University of Waterloo. "That's a problem

    whether users transition entirely away from smoking or use them as only a partial

- en: Even with these questions unresolved, the Japanese experience provides useful
    lessons for the rest of the world. The most obvious is that allowing consumers
    access to safer sources of nicotine can drastically reduce sales of cigarettes.
    For all the hand-wringing over dual use, it's difficult to view a near halving

    Sweanor 指出的那样，没有人会犹豫地将香烟销售量翻倍视为明显的灾难。）
- en: Another lesson from Japan is that smokers are willing to try lower-risk products,
    as long as those products offer pleasure. . Unlike pharmaceutical cessation aids,
    heated tobacco simulates the sensorial experience of smoking. It's also more socially
    acceptable than lighting up a conventional cigarette, fouling the air less noticeably

  zh: 从日本得出的另一个教训是，只要这些产品提供愉悦体验，吸烟者愿意尝试低风险产品。与药物戒烟辅助工具不同，加热烟草模拟了吸烟的感官体验。相比之下，它也更受社会接受，对旁观者的空气污染不那么明显。用户可能会发现自己开始转向低风险产品进行娱乐使用，甚至完全切换，即使他们最初并没有戒烟的意图。

- en: Finally, the Japanese experience points to the potential to achieve dramatic
    reductions in smoking without the planning or approval of government regulators.
    "[Japan] allowed one alternative to cigarettes onto the market," says Sweanor.
    "They didn't say, 'How do we change marketing rules to give an advantage to low-risk
    products?' They didn't say, 'How do we change tax policy?'…They didn't say, 'Let's
    run massive campaigns to inform people.' They just made one alternative available,

- en: Japan's massive reduction in cigarette sales is less the result of intentional
    policy than it is a bottom-up response from tobacco consumers making their own
