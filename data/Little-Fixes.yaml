- en: I walked with a mother who was pushing a stroller in the ditch. She told me
    that she needed to go to the store, didn't have a car that day, and didn't feel
    safe walking along the street, so she was taking the ditch, knee-high weeds and
    all. I observed the well-worn path she was treading and realized this was a struggle
    being shared with others.

  zh: 我和一位推着婴儿车走在沟渠中的母亲一同前行。她告诉我她需要去商店，那天没有车，也不觉得在街上走路安全，所以她选择了走沟渠，即使到处是膝盖高的杂草。我注意到她踏着的这条熟悉的路，意识到这是与其他人共享的挣扎。
- en: I met an elderly woman going down the street using a walker, climbing over mounds
    of snow left by the snowplow. She told me she had no choice but to get to the
    pharmacy that day. She pointed out that the street was cleared of snow but the
    sidewalk wasn't, so she was walking where she had to.

  zh: 我遇到了一位老年妇女，推着助行器沿着街道前行，爬过雪车留下的雪堆。她告诉我她当天别无选择，必须去药店。她指出街道上已经清理了积雪，但人行道没有，所以她只能走她必须走的路。
