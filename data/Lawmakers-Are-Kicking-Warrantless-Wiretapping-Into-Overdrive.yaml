    surveillance powers. The legislation has been packaged by its proponents as a
    reform bill but privacy advocates say that it would actually vastly expand the
    government’s spying capabilities.

- en: H.R. 7888, or the [Reforming Intelligence and Securing America Act](https://rules.house.gov/bill/118/hr-PIH-RISA),
    would renew key surveillance powers enjoyed by the U.S. intelligence community,
    broadly known as Section 702\. Section 702 was created in 2008 as part of [the
    FISA Amendments Act](https://www.eff.org/702-spying), which gave the government
    the legal authority to conduct warrantless surveillance of Americans who communicate
    with people outside of the country. The law allows the U.S. intelligence community
    (most [notably the NSA](https://www.wired.com/story/section-702-nsa-abuses-reauthorization/))
    [to conduct “targeted surveillance”](https://www.dni.gov/files/icotr/Section702-Basics-Infographic.pdf)
    of people outside the U.S. with the “compelled assistance of electronic communication
    service providers,” when a [government court](https://www.progressivecaucuscenter.org/the-foreign-intelligence-surveillance-act-and-the-warrantless-collection-of-personal-data)
    deems it necessary for national security reasons.

  zh: H.R. 7888，或称[情报改革与美国安全法案](https://rules.house.gov/bill/118/hr-PIH-RISA)，将更新美国情报社区广泛称为第702条的关键监视权力。第702条于2008年作为[FISA修正法案](https://www.eff.org/702-spying)的一部分而创建，授予政府与国外人士通信的美国人进行无需令状的监视的法律授权。该法允许美国情报社区（尤其是[NSA](https://www.wired.com/story/section-702-nsa-abuses-reauthorization/)）在[政府法院](https://www.progressivecaucuscenter.org/the-foreign-intelligence-surveillance-act-and-the-warrantless-collection-of-personal-data)认为出于国家安全原因必要时，利用电子通信服务提供商的强制协助进行“有针对性的监视”。

    Section 702 has become a “go-to domestic spying” tool that is used to “conduct
    hundreds of thousands of warrantless ‘backdoor’ searches for Americans’ private
    communications every year.”

    Center指出，第702条款已成为“常用的国内间谍工具”，用于每年进行数十万次无需令状的“后门”搜索，以获取美国人的私人通信。

    flows of [online communications providers](https://cdt.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Section-702.pdf).
    Now, however, the new update would vastly expand the government’s ability to deputize
    U.S. businesses to spy on communications. Problematically, the vague language
    within the bill makes it difficult to understand what kind of organizations would
    be called upon to spy for the government and which would be exempted.

- en: “The definition is incredibly broad,” Kia Hamadanchy, senior federal policy
    counsel at the ACLU, told Gizmodo. “There was a version that came out in December
    that was hugely problematic.” The new version, which was released this week, now
    exempts “certain businesses—like hotels, for instance,” he says. However, the
    very fact that these carveouts are necessary would seem to speak to the overly
    broad nature of the bill’s legal reach.

- en: The new amendment would — notwithstanding these exclusions — still permit the
    government to compel the assistance of a wide range of additional entities and
    persons in conducting surveillance under FISA 702\. The breadth of the new definition
    is obvious from the fact that the drafters felt compelled to exclude such ordinary
    places such as senior centers, hotels, and coffee shops. But for these specific
    exceptions, the scope of the new definition would cover them—and scores of businesses
    that did not receive a specific exemption remain within its purview.

  zh: 新修正案将允许政府强制要求广泛范围的其他实体和个人，在FISA 702条款下进行监视，尽管有这些例外情况。从新定义的广泛性来看，起草者感到有必要排除普通场所，如老年中心、酒店和咖啡店，这表明修正案的范围显而易见。但除了这些特定例外情况外，新定义的范围将覆盖它们以及许多未受特定豁免的企业。
- en: And even with these specific exceptions, the definition would include, for example,
    the owners and operators of facilities that house equipment used to store or carry
    data, such as data centers and buildings owned by commercial landlords, who merely
    have access to communications equipment in their physical space. It could also
    include other persons with access to such facilities and equipment, including
    delivery personnel, cleaning contractors, and utility providers.

- en: 'In other words, the government would be able to deputize an unknown amount
    of the private sector into acting as its own personal intelligence asset. Indeed,
    Hamadanchy gives some examples of companies that might potentially fall under
    this category and they are numerous: “Commercial landlords, grocery stores, barber
    shops, hardware shops, fitness centers” or, as he puts it, “anyone with a WiFi”
    connection.'

- en: Still, it remains unclear what, exactly, these companies would be asked to do,
    once they were involved in said spy work. In the case of commercial landlords,
    for instance, it seems unclear what role such a business owner might play if called
    upon to surveil a target for the government. That said, it’s easy to speculate.
    “My assumption is that they would go to the” landlord “and then tap into the WiFi
    network of that building,” Hamadanchy offered.

- en: If all of this doesn’t seem mildly horrifying to you, it probably should. “This
    is a bad bill,” Hamadanchy said. “We shouldn’t do a bad bill. We should take the
    time to do it right.” Hamadanchy said that the Senate rules could allow the policy
    process to be dragged out until Sunday and that he expected that there might be
    an effort to strip the bill of its more controversial policies.
