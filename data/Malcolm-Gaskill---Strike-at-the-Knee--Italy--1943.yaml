- en: Ortona,​ Christmas Eve, 1943\. A thriving Adriatic port only days previously,
    it now lay in ruins. The population of ten thousand was gone. In their place were
    two battalions of elite *Fallschirmjäger* – German paratroopers – defending what
    was left of the town, and the 1st Canadian Infantry Division, who were under orders
    to take it. There would be no festive truce. Allied shells had siled down all
    day, Sherman tanks blasting house after house, driving the enemy deeper into the
    rubble. Scores had died; bodies sprawled in the muddy streets. During an evening
    lull, Siegfried Bähr and a fellow radio operator pulled up armchairs in the room
    where they were sheltering, and warmed wine and sugar they’d found in the cellar.
    Later that night they each received a parcel containing a bun, chocolate, almonds
    and oranges, and, sharing memories of home, celebrated Christmas as best they
    could. Ortona would soon be known as Italy’s Stalingrad, but it also had something
    of Passchendaele about it.

    down, trapped by stalemate. Yet this involved some magical thinking. Even the
    assumptions underpinning the strategy were contradictory. The chief purpose of
    the invasion was to divert German men and materiel from the East in order to help
    Stalin, and from northern France so as to assist with the planned invasion there.
    But even as Hitler poured troops south through the Brenner Pass, the Allies hoped
    in vain that he would halt at a defensive line north of Rome, knowing that they
    lacked the strength to meet massed Wehrmacht ranks head on.'

    was gradually tempered by this reality. Their armies soon faced another string
    of defences – the Gustav Line – transecting Italy from the Garigliano River in
    the west to Ortona in the east, through the Apennines and across the northern
    road to Rome. There would be yet more lines to breach in 1944, more battles, more
    bloodshed. British infantry casualties were proportionally higher than during
    the First World War. The 3rd Coldstream Guards, a battalion of 845, lost a hundred
    men in the summer and autumn of 1943; by mid-December only 598 were left – a 30
    per cent depletion in strength. American divisions endured comparable slaughter.
    By the end of the year, the US 5th Army and British and Commonwealth forces had
    each suffered around thirty thousand casualties. Nearly 1400 Canadians died at
    Ortona in ‘Bloody December’, a quarter of that country’s losses in the Italian

    and, nine months later, the success of Operation Husky – the invasion of Sicily.
    But the Western Desert had been mostly flat, open terrain where battles conformed
    more or less to the designs of generals around a map table. And for Husky, the
    Allies had pitched two armies against four German divisions, a division being
    a quarter the size of an army. In Italy, not only was the country mountainous,
    but a significant part of those two Allied armies, on the eve of the invasion,
    was still in North Africa and Sicily. The opposition, moreover, was greater than
    before: eighteen divisions. And there was a population of 44 million people whose
    homes and lives would be in the firing line. Yet the Allies were heartened by
    an enabling prejudice that the war in Italy was Italy’s fault and, however regrettable,
    collateral damage caused by fighting its German allies was condonable. ‘These
    Italians are a rotten crowd,’ Montgomery lectured his troops. ‘They just lie among

    January 1943, where Roosevelt granted Churchill’s wish to pursue the war in the
    Mediterranean further. The US was keener on invading Normandy as soon as possible,
    and agreed to a limited Italian campaign as long as Operation Overlord retained
    priority. This is why the armies in Italy were short on resources – not only manpower
    but shipping and landing craft for amphibious assaults. Furthermore, harking back
    to the Union’s terms during the Civil War, Roosevelt insisted on ‘unconditional
    surrender’, which perturbed Churchill but suited Stalin because it precluded the
    Allies lining up an Axis enemy as an anti-Soviet ally (for the rapidly approaching
    Cold War), even if it also prevented Stalin from concluding his own peace. The
    American mentality was that of a heavyweight flexing for a knockout in a couple
    of rounds: across the Channel, into the Ruhr and Saarland, then onwards to Berlin.
    The British, bloodied at Dunkirk and Tobruk, and haunted by the ghosts of Flanders,
    were more cautious: a welterweight contender jabbing for weaknesses. Churchill
    called Italy ‘the soft underbelly of the crocodile’, and, mixing his animal metaphors,
    was emboldened after Sicily to ask: ‘Why should we crawl up the leg like a harvest-bug
    from the ankle upwards? Let us rather strike at the knee.’'

    - 不仅是人力，还有用于水陆两栖突击的船只和登陆艇。此外，回顾美国内战期间的条件，罗斯福坚持“无条件投降”，这让丘吉尔感到不安，但对斯大林来说很合适，因为这排除了盟军将轴心国作为反苏联盟友的可能性（在迅速接近的冷战中），即使这也阻止了斯大林达成自己的和平协议。美国的心态是重量级选手在几轮比赛后展现出来的：跨过英吉利海峡，进入鲁尔和萨尔兰，然后向柏林前进。英国人在敦刻尔克和托布鲁克战役中受到伤害，并且被弗兰德斯的幽灵所困扰，更为谨慎：一个轻量级的挑战者在搜索弱点。丘吉尔称意大利为“鳄鱼的软肚子”，并在攻克西西里后大胆地提出：“我们为什么要像从脚踝开始的收割虫一样爬上去呢？我们宁愿直接打击膝盖。”

    to remember it, but it’s been overlooked, idly regarded as filler between the

    the Americans see it, initially at least, as a sideshow, but in Britain a myth
    set in that the soldiers fighting in Italy had it easy: they were, according to
    a popular song, ‘The D-Day Dodgers’. Cornelius Ryan’s book *The Longest Day* (1959)
    and the movie it inspired, and since then *Saving Private Ryan* and the miniseries
    *Band of Brothers*, fixed Normandy as the prologue to a dominant narrative that
    unfolds like a quest, destined to end in Berlin. It was as if we couldn’t think
    about Italy at the same time even if we’d wanted to. Resisting this tendency,
    James Holland’s previous works – on Sicily and the mainland campaign of 1944-45,
    among other things – have raised awareness of what happened in Italy and why.
    It was never an untold story, but definitely an under-told one, especially regarding

    it was to deploy tanks in narrow valleys; the lethal exposure created by ascending

    human remains had been living, breathing young men’; the suddenly headless driver;
    the wounded man whose legs were sliced off when the mule carrying him stepped
    on a mine; the dead German sitting in a hedge smiling; the moonlit faces of corpses
    which ‘looked green, unearthly’. Then there are juxtapositions of violence and
    compassion: rum for a dying German, a sip of grappa for British prisoners, men
    comforting dying enemies – extemporary *pietà* of startling irony, like the famous
    shellhole scene in *All Quiet on the Western Front*. Appreciation of beauty and
    dread came together, too: the picture-postcard villa billets, beach jaunts where
    men ‘frolicked like fish and rejoiced like exuberant children’; shimmering violet
    peaks fading away like a dream; the serenity of a valley at sunrise.'

  zh: 机械化战争似乎仍然如此不自然，以至于溢出到离奇之境，难以用传统手段描述。超现实主义充斥其中，正如保罗·富塞尔在《大战与现代记忆》中所捕捉到的那样——霍兰德注意到1940年代也有类似的荒诞闪光。一个战争震惊的士兵对他的德国俘虏们喊道：“天哪，你们都长着英国人的脸！”
    艾伦·穆尔黑德在土耳其渡轮上与阿拉伯人挤在一起的“疯狂之旅”，完全出自伊夫林·沃夫的《荣誉之剑》三部曲。但大多数时候，超现实主义是可怕的：那些“几分钟前还是这些碎片化的人类遗骸曾经是活生生的、呼吸的年轻人”的不可理解；突然无头的司机；当驮驴踩到地雷时，携带他的伤员的双腿被砍断；坐在篱笆上微笑的死去的德国士兵；月光下尸体的面孔“看起来是绿色的，非人类的”。此外，还有暴力与同情并存的并置：为一个垂死的德国人送去朗姆酒，为英国囚犯送去一口格拉帕酒，男人们安慰垂死的敌人——这些令人惊讶的讽刺性临时圣像，如《西线无战事》中著名的弹坑场景。美与恐惧的赞赏也同时出现：明信片式的别墅营地，海滩远足时男人们“像鱼一样嬉戏，像兴高采烈的孩子一样欢乐”；闪烁的紫色山峰如梦般消逝；日出时的山谷宁静。
- en: Perplexed as they were by war’s strange encounters, men also learned how to
    survive – mainly how to be quick and accurate – and what they were capable of
    in extremis. Captain Lawrie Franklyn-Vaile of the Royal Irish Fusiliers was relieved
    to discover at Termoli, his first engagement, that he didn’t panic and was able
    to think clearly about how to lead his men. At the same time, courage was capital
    and men in battle were always spending it; when they were broke, they broke. (This
    was the insight of Charles Moran, a medical officer in the First World War, who
    appears in this book as Churchill’s doctor, when in December 1943 the prime minister
    suffered a heart attack.) After one of Franklyn-Vaile’s men was killed on a ridge
    at the River Moro, his best friend ‘went a bit mad, jumped up and began shouting
    and shooting wildly’, until one of his comrades knocked him out and carried him
    to an aid station. A German officer besieged in a house in Ortona suddenly dropped
    his machine-gun, asked the radio operator Siegfried Bähr for a cigarette, and
    strolled out into the piazza where he was mown down.

  zh: 尽管被战争的奇遇困扰，人们也学会了如何生存——主要是如何迅速和准确地行动——以及他们在极端情况下的能力。皇家爱尔兰轻步兵团的劳里·弗兰克林-维尔上尉在特尔莫利的首次交战中感到宽慰，他并没有恐慌，并且能够清晰地思考如何带领他的士兵。同时，勇气是资本，战斗中的人们总是在消耗它；当他们精疲力尽时，他们垮掉了。（这是查尔斯·莫兰的见解，他是第一次世界大战的医疗官，在本书中出现为丘吉尔的医生，1943年12月，首相遭受心脏病发作时也有所体会。）在弗兰克林-维尔的一个士兵在莫罗河的山脊上被杀后，他最好的朋友“有点发疯，跳了起来，开始乱喊乱射”，直到他的一个同志将他击昏并把他送往救护站。在奥尔托纳的一所房子中被围困的一名德国军官突然放下了机枪，向无线电操作员西格弗里德·贝尔要了一支香烟，然后漫步到广场上被击倒。
- en: 'Another​ frequently encountered difference between military history and the
    history of war is the attention paid in the latter to civil and political affairs,
    as well as the impact of hostilities on civilian lives. *The Savage Storm* is
    not merely set in Italy: like its predecessor *Italy’s Sorrow* (2008), it is about
    Italy, even if it focuses on the Allied and German armies rather than the civil
    war between partisans and fascists. Italy’s forced departure from the war, accelerated
    by the bombing of Rome and the conquest of Sicily, had thrown up many new problems.
    High-stakes brinkmanship and exquisite timing were necessary if Italy was to be
    turned into an anti-Nazi ally. Even when Italy had little choice but to leave
    the war, its negotiators at secret peace talks demanded more collateral for mortgaging
    the nation’s immediate future than the Allies could honestly promise. The craving
    for reassurance made Italians vulnerable to deceit. After Mussolini was deposed
    in July 1943, the Allies pressured the new prime minister, Marshal Badoglio, to
    agree to their ‘Short Terms’ for an armistice, which failed to mention unconditional
    surrender and other severe political conditions – to be imposed by the held-back
    ‘Long Terms’. Badoglio had been faced with a dilemma, unable to fight the Allies
    any longer yet struggling to summon enough trust to join them when his country
    was swarming with Germans ready to fight for territory south of Rome.'

  zh: 另一个经常遇到的军事历史和战争史的区别在于，后者对内部和政治事务的关注，以及敌对行动对平民生活的影响。*The Savage Storm* 并非仅仅发生在意大利：就像它的前作
    *Italy’s Sorrow*（2008）一样，它讲述的是意大利，即使它侧重于盟军和德军，而非游击队员和法西斯党之间的内战。意大利被迫退出战争，由于罗马的轰炸和西西里的征服，带来了许多新问题。如果要将意大利转变为反纳粹盟友，需要高风险的边缘政策和精确的时机。即使在意大利别无选择而必须退出战争时，其秘密和平谈判代表们对抵押国家即时未来的更多保证需求，超出了盟军能够诚实承诺的范围。对安全的渴望使意大利人易受欺骗。在1943年7月推翻墨索里尼之后，盟军向新任首相巴多里奥施压，同意接受他们的“短期条款”来达成停战，但没有提及无条件投降和其他严峻的政治条件——这些条件由拖延的“长期条款”施加。巴多里奥面临两难局面，无法再与盟军作战，但在他的国家充斥着准备为罗马南部领土而战的德国人时，他也很难召集足够的信任来加入他们。
- en: 'Civilians bore the brunt of these decisions. Aerial and ground warfare ravaged
    a poor population, severely testing the morality of the cause. Allied troops entering
    towns were shocked to find sanitation primitive or non-existent, streets and buildings
    filthy, scattered rubbish and clouds of flies. Emaciated children covered in sores
    came begging, while old women, also starving, sat around helplessly on the pavements.
    Jack Ward from Eastbourne, a sergeant-major in the Royal Artillery, saw ‘the worst
    sight I have ever seen: a baby in arms just looked like a piece of skin and bone
    with a head of an old man.’ The picturesque Italy that officers on both sides
    knew from holidays, and the other ranks from magazines and movies, was scarred
    wherever they went: craters, discarded equipment, bloated dead cattle, splintered
    olive trees, charred hayricks, hastily dug shallow graves.'

  zh: 平民承受了这些决策的大部分压力。空中和地面战争摧毁了一个贫穷的人口，严重考验着这场战争的道德性。进入城镇的联军士兵震惊地发现，卫生条件原始或不存在，街道和建筑物肮脏不堪，到处是垃圾和苍蝇。皮包骨的孩子们身上长满了疮痍，四处乞讨；而同样饥饿的老妇人则无助地坐在人行道上。来自东本恩的皇家炮兵中士杰克·沃德看到了“我见过的最糟糕的景象：一个怀抱婴儿的人看起来就像是一块皮肉和骨头，头上却是一个老人的脑袋。”
    军官们和士兵们从假期、杂志和电影中所了解的风景如画的意大利，在他们所到之处无不留下伤痕：弹坑、弃置的装备、膨胀的死牛、破碎的橄榄树、焦黑的草垛、匆忙挖掘的浅浅坟墓。
- en: Many civilians were directly caught up in the fighting, like 24-year-old Carla
    Capponi dodging tank shells in the streets around the Colosseum, or the Masella
    family of San Pietro, cut down by American troops who mistook them for *Panzergrenadiers*.
    At Eboli, horribly burned people were laid in a stable and cared for by a medical
    student. In Termoli, an entire family was blasted from the doorway of their home,
    leaving only a boy who ran around with his viscera exposed until an SAS man caught
    him and delivered the coup de grâce with his pistol. Retreating Germans laid mines
    and rigged up booby traps, with tripwires strung in fiendish webs – ‘devil’s gardens’
    – or tied to the sort of abandoned object, a pencil, say, that might be picked
    up by a curious GI, or, as often happened, a child.

  zh: 许多平民直接卷入了战斗中，比如24岁的卡拉·卡波尼在环绕斗兽场的街道上躲避坦克炮弹，或者圣皮耶特罗的马塞拉家族，被误认为是*装甲步兵*而被美军击倒。在埃博利，一些被严重烧伤的人被放在马厩里，并由一名医学生照料。在特尔莫利，一整个家庭被炸弹从他们家门口冲出，只剩下一个男孩在四处奔跑，内脏暴露在外，直到一名SAS战士逮住他，并用手枪了结他的性命。撤退的德军布设了地雷并设置了诡计多端的陷阱，用三脚架构成恶魔的花园，或者将绊线绑在被抛弃的物体上，比如一支铅笔，可能会被一个好奇的美国士兵捡起，或者像经常发生的那样，一个孩子。
- en: The destruction of property was apocalyptic, most of it caused by the Allies.
    On 1 August 1943 an air raid on Rome claimed the lives of a thousand civilians
    and injured twice as many. A fortnight later, another thousand died in Milan,
    where 3000 buildings were flattened or damaged, including the church of Santa
    Maria delle Grazie. One wall of the refectory was left standing – by extraordinary
    chance, the one bearing Leonardo’s *Last Supper*. Naples was bombed 180 times
    that year, inflicting unbelievable suffering on its inhabitants. In countless
    towns and villages, as families looked on, Allied tanks smashed through homes
    if their line of fire was obscured or they suspected the enemy lay behind. A shortage
    of infantry increased Allied reliance on artillery to level towns before they
    dared enter. Ortona was ruined partly because the Germans blew up streets to funnel
    advancing squads into crossfires, but also because the Canadians knocked through
    walls – a practice known as ‘mouseholing’ – so they could pass from house to house
    without exposing themselves to dangerous street-fighting. Canadian gunners shelled
    the dome of St Thomas’s to prevent its use as an observation post, and were ordered
    to destroy the cathedral, though mercifully this was avoided. The writer Norman
    Lewis, then an intelligence officer, blamed General Clark, the commander of the
    5th Army, for the destruction of Battipaglia, which he thought resembled an Italian
    Guernica.

  zh: 财产的毁坏是末日般的，其中大部分是由盟军造成的。1943年8月1日，对罗马的空袭造成了一千名平民死亡，两倍于此的人受伤。两周后，在米兰又有一千人死亡，其中包括圣母玛利亚德莱格拉齐教堂，3000座建筑物被夷为平地或受损。教堂食堂的一面墙奇迹般地留了下来，上面是达·芬奇的《最后的晚餐》。那年那不勒斯被轰炸了180次，给城市居民带来了难以置信的痛苦。在无数城镇和村庄中，当家庭目睹时，盟军的坦克会摧毁房屋，如果他们的火线被遮挡或怀疑敌人藏在后面。步兵短缺增加了盟军对炮兵的依赖，以在他们进入之前摧毁城镇。奥尔托纳的毁坏部分是因为德军炸毁街道，以便将前进的小队引入交叉火力，但也因为加拿大人打通了墙壁——这种被称为“钻洞”的做法——以便他们可以在房屋之间穿行，而不暴露自己于危险的街头战斗。加拿大炮手轰击圣托马斯大教堂的圆顶，以防止其用作观察哨，他们被命令摧毁大教堂，但幸运地是避免了这一点。当时担任情报官的作家诺曼·刘易斯责怪第五军指挥官克拉克将军破坏了巴蒂帕利亚，他认为那像是一个意大利的格尔尼卡。
- en: 'Lewis was stationed in Naples, where there were power cuts, water shortages,
    bread riots and epidemics of typhus and smallpox. The city had been in Allied
    hands since October 1943, but there were many more cities to be taken. After a
    bitter winter, the British and American armies pushed north throughout most of
    1944, taking Rome and Ancona and Florence, and breaching the Gothic Line the following
    spring. By the end of April 1945, Bologna, Genoa, Milan, Turin and Venice had
    all fallen, and the Germans surrendered. The joy of liberation was all too often
    vitiated by trauma. The Allied troops who occupied Naples and other distressed
    cities had begun the campaign unsympathetic towards Italians. Now, however, their
    views were softened. Conscious of the devastation they had wreaked for freedom
    and democracy, some doubted their own righteousness and marvelled that ordinary
    people – the pillaged sharecroppers and bombed factory workers, famished urchins
    and mothers driven to prostitution – found it in their hearts to see the invaders
    as liberators, friends, even surrogate sons. Many Italians, it seemed, had been
    politically agnostic, indifferent or hostile to fascism, unmoved by its slogans,
    the most cynically hollow being: ‘War puts the stamp of nobility on those who
    have the courage to meet it.’ Mussolini’s gamble had delivered none of the promised
    rewards, and not even the victors believed there was nobility in war, unless it
    was in the fortitude and dignity of the Italian people.'

  zh: 路易斯被驻扎在那不勒斯，那里经历了断电、缺水、面包骚乱和斑疹伤寒以及天花的流行。这座城市自1943年10月起由盟军控制，但还有许多城市等待解放。经过一个寒冷的冬季后，英美军队在1944年大部分时间内向北推进，占领了罗马、安科纳、佛罗伦萨，并在随后的春季突破了哥特防线。到1945年4月底，博洛尼亚、热那亚、米兰、都灵和威尼斯都已经沦陷，德军投降了。解放的喜悦往往被创伤所掩盖。占领那不勒斯和其他困境城市的盟军开始对意大利人表现出同情。现在，他们的看法变得柔和了。意识到他们为了自由和民主所造成的破坏，一些人开始怀疑自己的正义性，并对普通人——被掠夺的佃农和遭轰炸的工厂工人、饥饿的流浪儿和被迫卖淫的母亲们——心存感激，将侵略者视为解放者、朋友，甚至替代儿子。许多意大利人似乎在政治上持中立态度，对法西斯主义冷漠或敌视，对其口号无动于衷，其中最虚伪的是：“战争使有勇气面对它的人获得尊贵的标志。”墨索里尼的赌博没有带来承诺的任何回报，甚至胜利者也不认为战争中有尊贵，除非是在意大利人民的坚韧和尊严中。
