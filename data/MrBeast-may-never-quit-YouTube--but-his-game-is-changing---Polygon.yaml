    on X (formerly Twitter)](https://twitter.com/DramaAlert/status/1698131769810128985?)
    saw Irish YouTube entertainer Seán “Jacksepticeye” McLoughlin strapped to a lie
    detector test. His friends were grilling him about everything, like whether or
    not he still enjoyed his job as a YouTuber and how much money he had in the bank.
    Though sensitive, none of the questions fazed McLoughlin, a video star with millions
    of subscribers on YouTube. To truly rattle him, his friends had to pull out the
    big guns — questions that, if answered honestly, would make most squirm. Has YouTube
    gotten worse as a platform, they probed? Yes, McLoughlin answered, still not missing
    a beat. And he said Jimmy “MrBeast” Donaldson, YouTube’s biggest creator, was
    to blame.

    “Jacksepticeye” McLoughlin被绑在测谎仪上。他的朋友们正在盘问他各种问题，比如他是否依然喜欢自己作为YouTuber的工作，以及他的银行账户里有多少钱。尽管问题非常敏感，但这些问题都没有让McLoughlin感到困扰，他是YouTube上数百万订阅者的视频明星。为了真正让他感到不安，他的朋友们必须使出绝招
    —— 提出那些如果诚实回答会让大多数人感到不安的问题。YouTube作为一个平台变得更糟了吗？他们询问道。是的，McLoughlin毫不犹豫地回答道。他还说，YouTube上最大的创作者Jimmy
    “MrBeast” Donaldson应对此负责。

    a reputation for generous stunts that give ordinary people cars, houses, and thousands
    of dollars, many think of MrBeast as a kind of philanthropic figure, representing

    While his free time seems minuscule, the rare times he does pull away from work
    are for dates with his girlfriend that center around activities that could enrich
    his videos, because he considers a single hour of a date [to be worth $100K](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F73I47u1iQU)

  zh: 尽管他的朋友们早有预料，但McLoughlin的回答震惊了互联网。许多人认为MrBeast是一种慷慨行为的象征，以大方的花费为普通人购买汽车、房屋和成千上万美元，他代表了YouTube最好的一面。他的品牌形象既自我吹嘘又无私；在播客中，他经常提醒他的2.41亿订阅者（出版时）他之所以处于顶端，正是因为他只做YouTube，而他想做的只是娱乐观众。他[住在自己的录音工作室](https://www.insider.com/photos-inside-mrbeasts-14-million-top-secret-filming-studio-2023-5#donaldson-lives-in-a-humble-apartment-tucked-away-inside-the-studio-4)。虽然他的空闲时间似乎微不足道，但他很少从工作中抽身，只有在与女友约会时才会放松，而这些活动也可能会丰富他的视频内容，因为他认为一小时的约会时间[如果用来工作的话，价值十万美元](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F73I47u1iQU)。
- en: The idea that MrBeast throws all the money he makes — and it’s considerable
    — back into doing YouTube videos is practically lore. There’s little regard for
    personal profit, [or so he says](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5YW4JB07-8).
    He tells viewers that while he employs a sizable percentage of his hometown, he
    still lives modestly, unlike other rich YouTubers. A segment of his fortune goes
    toward philanthropy, and in many of his videos he finds a way to give people valuables.
    Viewers dream of running into MrBeast and his oodles of cash. Creators, meanwhile,
    can only imagine what it’s like to have the sort of audience reach and clout MrBeast
    does. He [builds wells in Africa](https://www.cnn.com/2023/11/06/africa/mrbeast-100-wells-africa-intl-scli/index.html),

    [top creators with millions of subscribers came to MrBeast’s defense](https://twitter.com/Dexerto/status/1698173864088354879).
    There was incredulity, there was indignity. Nobody would say such a thing unless
    they were jealous or out of their mind, the replies suggested. But McLoughlin
    seemed to be in a fair state of mind, based on his explanation. And by virtue
    of having been on YouTube as Jacksepticeye for years up to that point, he was
    inherently an authority on how the platform has changed. In the Q&A video, McLoughlin
    says that MrBeast made YouTube worse by shifting the focus to be “more about views,
    money, and popularity” over having fun. If it wasn’t superficial, McLoughlin argued,
    MrBeast’s videos would be longer — and we’d see more of him having a good time.

    we’ve seen distinct eras start and end on the platform. At first, YouTube prized
    authenticity, and the prototypical creator was likely recording out of their bedroom
    on an iPhone. Once real money came into the picture, the same creators who built
    the platform became brands who made a living off of their popularity. The camera-ready

    Smigel在最近的视频中探讨的](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ikEfScuLQ2Y)，我们看到平台上不同的时代开始和结束。起初，YouTube重视真实性，原型创作者可能是在他们的卧室里用iPhone录制视频。一旦真正的金钱进入画面，那些建立平台的创作者变成了通过他们的人气谋生的品牌。例如，今天你看到的Smosh，他们在Instagram等平台上精心打造社交媒体形象的傻瓜，与2005年创办该频道的业余二人组完全不同。

    style their video thumbnails. Up until recently, MrBeast had the biggest video
    on the platform. Rare is the video that doesn’t take cues from MrBeast’s signature
    and endlessly memeable reaction face. As far as detractors like McLoughlin are
    concerned, MrBeast copycats are a plague on YouTube. And even if they do wholly

    of self-improvement — which has allowed him to evade tough questions. In interviews,
    Donaldson candidly reveals the tough conditions that make his videos possible,
    like building a friend group that constantly criticizes his output and axing expensive,

    which is part of why his business has expanded to include food items that can

    the very start of his career as a YouTuber, MrBeast’s funds come from sponsorship
    brands who are happy to drop cash for a viral video that covertly acts as advertisement.
    Though he’s been under scrutiny for his part in the warping of YouTube as a content
    ecosystem, you will never see something outwardly controversial or offensive in

    a part of his newfound focus on producing material with better stories. His theory,
    which he’s been talking about for over a year now on podcasts, is that good storytelling
    will take his videos to the next level. But good stories are about people, not
    brands — that’s advertising.

  zh: 某种程度上，唐纳森必须感到他站立的地方发生了变化。在X（以前的Twitter）上，[MrBeast的更新](https://twitter.com/MrBeast/status/1713235345498669056)表明他正在尝试用他的视频做新事物
    - 一年前，这些可能听起来在MrBeast视频中是亵渎的。他少叫了，和他的朋友们一起玩得更多了。视频放慢了，因此比他的旧视频更长。他包括了更傻的材料，即使它看起来与视频无关。对唐纳森来说，这些变化都是他专注于制作更好故事材料的新重点的一部分。他的理论，在播客上已经谈论了一年多，是良好的叙事将带来他的视频的下一个水平。但是好故事是关于人的，而不是品牌
    - 那是广告。
- en: If Donaldson is right, then McLoughlin is also right. The question is whether
    or not audiences and their evolving tastes can ever fully see a MrBeast video
    as something earnest, which by their very nature might be impossible. Real people
    aren’t hiring hitmen to track them down, or blowing millions on making a bank
    explode. But the next era of YouTube seems to be bending a superstar toward its
    ideal mode rather than the reverse.

  zh: 如果唐纳森是对的，那么麦克洛克林也是对的。问题在于观众及其不断发展的口味是否能够完全将MrBeast的视频视为真诚的东西，而这本质上可能是不可能的。真实的人并不会雇佣杀手来追踪他们，或者花费数百万使银行爆炸。但下一个YouTube时代似乎正在将一位超级明星弯向其理想模式，而不是相反。
- en: “The return to an authentic era on YouTube comes down to a growing fatigue with
    sensationalism. […] I think we are witnessing a cultural shift,” Smigel says.
    “Millions of people, myself included, grew up on the internet, and for years we’ve
    been bombarded with sensationalism. It’s exhausting. Personally, I crave human
    connection.”

  zh: “YouTube回归真实时代的趋势归结于对耸人听闻感到日益厌倦。[...] 我认为我们正在见证一种文化转变，” 斯密格尔说。“数百万人，包括我在内，从互联网上长大，多年来我们一直被耸人听闻所淹没。这令人筋疲力尽。就我个人而言，我渴望人与人之间的连接。”
- en: 'In early 2023, watching a MrBeast video was the psychological equivalent of
    getting on a roller coaster ride that pulls you into a drop moments after stepping
    inside. A year later, Donaldson still bombards viewers with a screaming MrBeast
    within the first 30 seconds of run time. His anxiety to keep people watching remains
    palpable: [In a recent video about subjecting someone to his worst fears](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KOEfDvr4DcQ),
    MrBeast sets off a fake explosion during a simple explanation of the parameters.
    But unlike in the past, it’s easy to keep track of the jump cuts, excessive as
    they might be. Rather than squeezing in a quick preview of the most sensational
    moments of his video at the start, as he usually does, Donaldson lingers on his
    subject a smidge more. An evolution, even if it’s all in the details, is underway.'

  zh: 2023年初，观看MrBeast的视频就像是坐上了过山车，一踏进视频，你立刻就会感受到被拉入一段即将下落的心理状态。一年后，唐纳森依然在视频开始的30秒内用尖叫的MrBeast轰炸观众。他焦虑地想要让人们继续观看的心情仍然是如此明显：[最近一个视频是关于让某人面对他最大的恐惧](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KOEfDvr4DcQ)，MrBeast在简单解释参数时设法引爆了一个假炸弹。但与过去不同的是，现在很容易跟上这些跳切，尽管它们可能有些过多。与其像往常一样在开头快速预览视频中最轰动的时刻，唐纳森现在更多地停留在他的主题上。即使这只是细节上的进化，但它正在进行中。
