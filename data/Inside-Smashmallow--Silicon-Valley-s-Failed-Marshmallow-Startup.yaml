    to learn. Smashmallow bought big, commercial Hobart mixers to combine and whip
    the sugar and gelatin. They poured the mix onto huge cookie sheets, on top of
    starch to keep it from sticking — a process called "slabbing." They bought special
    cutters to slice the hardened marshmallow into cubes, and learned how to dust
    them with sugar and cinnamon to make a churro flavor, to blend in other flavors
    like strawberry and root beer, to include chocolate chips or coconut flakes, to
    pour out multiple layers to get two-color versions. "It was all hand-done, so

    for grab-and-go for their kids' lunchboxes." It had taken Krave five years to

    the conveyor-belt process used for mass-produced marshmallows. Extrusion is cheaper,
    faster, and less labor-intensive than slabbing. It's basically a marshmallow printer,

- en: Wolfgang's quotas weren't the only problem. The sales team had gotten Smashmallows
    into 15,000 stores, and those retailers were signing agreements for product up
    to 18 months in advance. Sebastiani had made a deal for coveted end-aisle displays
    for Halloween — "Malloween!" — in every Target store in America. "We were expecting
    a significant growth curve," Sebastiani says. "We were taking on investment dollars,
    not only from my firm, Sonoma Capital, but from limited partners and endowments.
    My reputation was on the line."

    marshmallows weren't as good as the originals. Sales declined. Stores cut back
    on their orders. "We were producing four days a week, and then we were down to
    three days," Hoj says.

- en: The relationship between Smashmallow and Tanis finally broke. Smashmallow threatened
    to withhold payment until repairs were made, and canceled the installation of
    the experimental component designed to improve the addition of inclusions. Tanis
    responded by ceasing tech support. An acrimonious meeting aimed at resolving the
    issues ended with the establishment of a payment plan tied to production levels.
    If Smashmallow couldn't produce enough marshmallows, Tanis wouldn't get its dough.

    回应称停止技术支持。一场旨在解决问题的激烈会议以与生产水平挂钩的付款计划而告终。如果 Smashmallow 不能生产足够的棉花糖，Tanis 将无法获得支付。
- en: In the end, Smashmallow couldn't keep up with its obligations to investors,
    retailers, and the copacker. Sebastiani's dream of candy dominance was dead. Wolfgang
    sued to recover the nearly half a million dollars it said Smashmallow owed for
    not keeping up with sugar quotas; Sebastiani settled by giving them components
    from the machine.He, in turn, sued Tanis to recover not only the costs of the
    entire fiasco but the potential value of the company, had it been a success. In
    2022, Smashmallow shut down for good.

    没能达到糖配额而起诉追回近50万美元的款项；Sebastiani 最终通过提供机器组件来解决。与此同时，他起诉 Tanis，要求不仅赔偿整个惨败的成本，还要赔偿公司的潜在价值，如果它成功了的话。2022
    年，Smashmallow 永久关闭。

- en: In court, Tanis insisted that the machine had, at times, gotten up to full speed
    and satisfied the terms of the contract. It accused Smashmallow of slowing the
    assembly line's output by switching up the flavors too often, requiring time-consuming
    cleanup. But at trial, a Tanis engineer admitted that the samples Tanis had sent
    to Smashmallow to prove it could produce the product were actually made, in part,
    by hand. ApparentlyTanis, too, had faked it to make it.

    Tanis 的工程师承认，Tanis 发送给 Smashmallow 的样品实际上部分是手工制作的。显然，Tanis 也是假装成功。
- en: Everyone agrees that it ought to have been possible, engineering-wise, to make
    a machine that made Smashmallows. Everyone also agrees that, in the end, no one
    was able to. "The fact that Tanis said they could do it was interesting," says
    Richard Hartel, a food engineer who leads the candymaking program at the University
    of Wisconsin. "Their engineers must have said, 'Well, this shouldn't be a problem.'
    They probably figured this was going to be easy, and it turned out to be harder
    than they thought." The jury agreed, awarding Smashmallow $20 million in damages.
    After some legal back-and-forth, the parties settled for an undisclosed amount.

  zh: 所有人都认为在工程上应该有可能制造出制造 Smashmallow 的机器。但最终，没有人做到。“Tanis 说他们能做到这一点是有趣的，”理查德·哈特尔说，他是威斯康星大学糖果制造项目的食品工程师。“他们的工程师肯定说，‘这应该不是问题。’他们可能认为这会很容易，结果比他们想象的更难。”
    陪审团同意了这一观点，判决 Smashmallow 获得2000万美元的赔偿金。在一番法律争议后，各方最终达成了保密协议（Tanis 和 Wolfgang
    对此故事均未发表评论）。

- en: The thing is, even though Smashmallow failed, Sebastiani didn't. During trial
    prep, his lawyers had a fun idea. They thought they might bring a bag of Smashmallows
    to trial, to show the judge and jury what they were talking about. One of the
    attorneys, David Kwasniewski, called a bunch of Bay Area stores, and a clerk at
    an REI in Santa Rosa said they had a bag in stock. "Come on by," he said.

  zh: 事实上，尽管Smashmallow失败了，Sebastiani没有失败。在庭审准备期间，他的律师们有了一个有趣的主意。他们认为他们可以带一袋Smashmallows到庭审中，向法官和陪审团展示他们所说的是什么。其中一名律师David
    Kwasniewski给旧金山湾区的一些商店打了电话，Santa Rosa的REI商店的一个店员说他们有货。 “过来吧，”他说。
- en: Kwasniewski hopped in a car and drove up from San Francisco — it takes about
    an hour. He walked into the store and found the clerk, who went behind the counter
    and handed him a bag of gourmet marshmallows. But they weren't Smashmallows. These
    were made by a small Colorado company called Hammond's, which sells cube-shaped
    premium marshmallows in toasted coconut, chocolate chip, and a two-layer strawberry
    créme, among other flavors.

  zh: Kwasniewski跳进一辆车从旧金山开了一个小时车程，他走进商店找到了店员，后者走到柜台后递给他一袋美食棉花糖。但这不是Smashmallows，这些是由一家叫Hammond's的科罗拉多小公司制造的，他们销售着方块形状的优质棉花糖，包括烤椰子、巧克力片和两层草莓奶油等口味。
- en: The lawyer was gobsmacked. Smashmallow had crossed over into that rarest of
    territories — a brand that's become synonymous with its product. "In that industry,
    a snackable marshmallow *is* a Smashmallow, like a copy machine is a Xerox," says
    Kwasniewski. Smashmallows don't exist anymore, "but the brand is still out there."

    category of snack, and changed people's eating habits. When he created Smashmallow,
    the [annual market for marshmallows in North America](https://www.fortunebusinessinsights.com/north-america-marshmallow-market-105434)
    was about $250 million. By 2028, it's projected to hit $535 million. Sebastiani
    won't see a dime of that money, because his business plan required a technology
    that didn't — and maybe couldn't — exist. He built a sweet brand. But the product
    was mostly hot air.
