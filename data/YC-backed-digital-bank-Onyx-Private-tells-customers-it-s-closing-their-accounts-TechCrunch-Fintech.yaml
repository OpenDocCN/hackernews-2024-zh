    for community banks, regional banks, and credit unions” that want to launch digital
    apps built for young affluent consumers. Santos claimed that Onyx had been exploring
    the idea over the past year and had made developments with some partners.

    million in venture funding](https://techcrunch.com/2023/05/22/onyx-private-affluent-bank-fintech/)
    from investors such as Village Global, Y Combinator, Global Founders Capital,
    One Way Ventures, 186 Ventures and Olive Tree Capital. At that time, the company
    said that since its launch nearly a year prior, Onyx Private – which said it wanted
    to be the “next generation UBS” – had grown 30% month-over-month and was processing
    over $4 million in transaction payment value per month. It also claimed to be
    nearing $5 million in TPV (total payment volume).

    a source told TechCrunch that regulatory issues may have played a part in this

    startup to shut down its direct-to-consumer banking operations.
