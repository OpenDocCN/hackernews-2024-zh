- en: Is it possible to write a satirical campus novel anymore? Satire requires exaggeration
    and the pointed introduction of absurdity, but it is hard to see how modern university
    life could be further embellished in these respects. As usual, there were some
    classic stories served up this week for civilians to laugh at.

- en: 'In the [*Daily Mail*](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-13120817/microaggression-Britain-universities.html)
    we read that policies at Glasgow University and Imperial College London now direct
    staff and students to avoid the phrase “the most qualified person should get the
    job” because this counts as a microaggression. Over in the US, yet another professor
    resplendent in beadwork and buckskin has [admitted](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2024/03/04/a-professor-claimed-to-be-native-american-did-she-know-she-wasnt)
    to falsely claiming possession of Native American ancestry. And an article just
    out in the [*Applied Linguistics Review*](https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/applirev-2024-0014/html)
    provides a brand new excuse to lazy researchers: the requirement of a literature
    review in some disciplines imposes “particular configurations of privileged knowledge”
    amounting to an “enactment of symbolic violence”. Or, at least, that’s what students
    will be telling linguistics lecturers from now on.'

  zh: 在[*每日邮报*](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-13120817/microaggression-Britain-universities.html)上，我们看到格拉斯哥大学和伦敦帝国学院的政策现在指导员工和学生避免使用短语“应该给最有资格的人工作”，因为这被视为微侮辱。在美国，另一位身着珠饰和鹿皮衣饰的教授又[承认](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2024/03/04/a-professor-claimed-to-be-native-american-did-she-know-she-wasnt)错误地声称拥有美国原住民血统。并且在[*应用语言学评论*](https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/applirev-2024-0014/html)中最新一篇文章为懒惰的研究人员提供了一个全新的借口：某些学科的文献综述要求“特定的特权知识构建”，等于“象征性暴力的执行”。或者至少，从现在起，这是学生将告诉语言学讲师的内容。
- en: The organisation that first uncovered the story about microaggressions is the
    [Committee for Academic Freedom](https://afcomm.org.uk/), newly formed by philosophy
    lecturer Edward Skidelsky to push back against institutional incursions on free
    inquiry. During drinks at the committee’s launch, where I was a guest speaker,
    more astonishing tales were aired. I heard of endocrinologists at one Russell
    Group institution being forced to disavow binary theories of biological sex; of
    male trans-identified dance students at a prestigious arts establishment insisting
    they be allowed to perform lead ballerina roles and be hoisted aloft during lifts;
    and of a reading list in one department with pronouns added for every cited author,
    including those of Osama Bin Laden (“He/Him”, in case you’re wondering). As I
    mingled, I added each new tale to my mental inventory of university batshittery,
    already creaking at the seams.

  zh: 第一个揭露微侮辱故事的组织是由哲学讲师爱德华·斯基德尔斯基新成立的[学术自由委员会](https://afcomm.org.uk/)，旨在抵制对自由探究的制度侵犯。在委员会成立仪式上的酒会上，我作为嘉宾发言人，听到了更多令人惊讶的故事。我听说有一所罗素集团的学术机构的内分泌学家被迫否认生物性别的二元理论；有一位男性跨性别的舞蹈学生在一所名校的艺术学院坚持要求扮演首席芭蕾舞女演员，并在举起的时候被抬起；还有一个系的阅读清单中，每位被引用的作者都加了代词，包括奥萨马·本·拉登（“他/他”，以防你想知道）。当我交际时，我把每个新故事都添加到了我心中的大学疯狂清单中，已经快承受不住了。
- en: But while the general public increasingly gets the joke, and a growing band
    of disgruntled renegades joins organisations like CAF, it is still true that most
    employees within relevant institutions remain po-faced and acquiescent in the
    light of blatantly stupid initiatives by their managers and colleagues. Partly
    this is because they are frightened to do otherwise, as new research also [published](https://afcomm.org.uk/2024/02/22/caf-survey-reveals-climate-of-oppression-and-fear-in-uk-universities/)
    this week by CAF suggests. But partly, perhaps, it’s because nearly all of the
    personality types who might in the past have viciously mocked, scathingly critiqued,
    or otherwise put up an intellectual fight have been weeded out of the system.

  zh: 但是尽管公众越来越明白这个笑话，一群日益不满的叛逆者加入了类似CAF的组织，事实仍然是，大多数相关机构内的员工在面对他们的经理和同事明显愚蠢的倡议时仍然面无表情，默许不语。部分原因是因为他们害怕做出反对，正如CAF本周新发布的研究[显示](https://afcomm.org.uk/2024/02/22/caf-survey-reveals-climate-of-oppression-and-fear-in-uk-universities/)的那样。但或许部分原因是因为过去可能会狠狠嘲笑、尖刻批评或者以其他方式进行知识斗争的个性类型几乎都被系统清除了。
