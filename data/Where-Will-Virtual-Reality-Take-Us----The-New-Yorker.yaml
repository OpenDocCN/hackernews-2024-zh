    are newness junkies, it can feel like an act of sabotage to have memories, but,
    for better or worse, I have them. It’s been more than forty years since I co-founded
    the first company to make headsets and software for simulated experiences, and
    came up with familiar terms like virtual and mixed reality. Since then, [virtual
    reality](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/virtual-reality) has flooded the public
    imagination in waves; back in the nineteen-eighties, for instance, it had quite
    a presence in movies, cartoons, TV shows, the occasional arcade game, and a few
    early consumer products, like the Nintendo Power Glove. I still love V.R. But,
    these days, I sense that what I experience of it, what I enjoy in it, is different
    from what it has come to mean to many enthusiasts.

    that might swallow us all to good effect. I don’t agree with that sort of talk
    now, but at the time the joy of being edgy and extreme was too great to resist.
    Every young technical person wants to see around the corners that others cannot,
    to be the harbinger of great change. To explain to someone in the early eighties
    what V.R. was—to give them a demo—was an ego rush, because they often couldn’t
    grasp what was being said or what had just happened to them. It was a primal validation,
    a power trip, and I wish I had done it with more humility. But here we are, after
    almost a half century of products, movies, and startups, and V.R. people still
    seek that rush. Apple’s promotional videos for its new headset—the Vision Pro,
    a metal-and-glass, ski-goggle-like apparatus that costs around thirty-five hundred
    dollars—show people experiencing V.R. for the first time. The producers either
    had to search hard for those people or ask actors to pretend.

    and help us create the first generation of commercial V.R. products. At the time,
    we guessed that Apple itself would enter the market in 2010\. We knew that the
    consumer adoption of the technology was a long way off. We were selling tools
    for millions of dollars to customers like *NASA*. But despite the conservative
    clients, our early V.R. software was radically strange. You could program while
    in our virtual world, and see all the variables not as textual symbols but as
    virtual objects; there was no source code. I used to wax on about how virtual
    reality would lead to a new style of “post-symbolic” communication, in which we

    in the nineteen-nineties. Some mixed or augmented headsets, such as the Microsoft
    HoloLens or the system created by Magic Leap, allow you to see the real world
    through the headset glass so that it can be combined with virtual content using
    challenging optical techniques. Others, like Apple’s Vision Pro and [the recent

    that people are cattle, and not free-range ones. This is a good reason for wanting
    virtual reality to be an environment in which users actively create their own
    content, rather than passively experiencing what big companies have built for
    them. For most of the technology’s history, however, virtual experiences have
    been hard to build and maintain. This has been one of V.R.’s biggest problems.
    I saw the first V.R. teaching demonstration of general relativity at least as
    early as 1992, and have seen dozens more since then; they’re often wonderful,
    and help users grasp the concept in new ways. But they only run for a year or
    so because there are too many variables in a V.R. system for creators to keep
    experiences available. Graphics chips change, and with them the layers of mediating
    software. That’s true for other programs, too, but with V.R., when the properties
    of a headset (like field of view) or an input device shift, the whole experience
    and interaction method must often be rejiggered. It’s too much ongoing effort,
    so it usually doesn’t happen; developers move on to other projects. The exceptions
    have been locked-down V.R. experiences that assume a minimal level of interaction,
    which limits the magic.

    back at the start, some of my young colleagues and I made a vow: if we ever became
    parents—a possibility as remote for us at that time as a visit to Alpha Centauri—we
    would slip baby V.R. googles onto our kids at birth, then swap in bigger ones
    as the kids grew. That way, our kids could grow up in four dimensions, and become
    the greatest mathematicians ever. When I told my daughter about this, at around
    age eight, she was angry that I’d denied her this chance.'

  zh: 但我不认为顾客们希望那样的未来。人们能感觉到其潜在荒谬，并且看到这将导致他们失去脚踏实地和意义。在虚拟现实的早期阶段，我实际上曾试图一直生活在其中；在多个场合，我曾在虚拟现实中连续待上几天。事实上，在最初阶段，我和一些年轻同事还立下誓言：如果我们有一天成为父母——那时对我们来说和访问半人马座Alpha星一样遥远的可能性——我们会在孩子出生时就给他们戴上婴儿虚拟现实眼镜，然后随着孩子的成长换上更大的眼镜。这样，我们的孩子可以在四维空间中成长，成为最伟大的数学家。当我对我女儿（大约八岁时）讲述这件事时，她很生气，因为我拒绝了她这个机会。
