    there's an ongoing effort to address. The team might do all of their work on virtual
    machines, and have a simple chat command that provisions those machines for them.
    Or they might have a pretty good continuous integration system and good habits
    around making small changes, so not being able to run the tests locally isn't
    stopping them from deploying multiple times a day.

    it is, or maybe there's an easy change once I find the right scripts. That's not

    really simple way to fix that I just didn't see at first. There are always so
    many problems on a team, so many things that could be better, that I'm only ever
    going to solve a handful of them. Working on problems in the order I noticed them
    is rarely the most effective order. So the WTF Notebook gives me a place to park
    the impulse to *fix it now, damn it!* until I have more context for deciding what
