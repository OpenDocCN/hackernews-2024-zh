- en: The agency recently contracted a private company to install nearly 200 additional
    cameras across the East Bay — bringing the total number of cameras in the region
    overseen by the highway patrol to 480, according to state and local officials.

- en: In announcing the camera system Friday, Newsom called it a chance to tackle
    organized crime and improve public safety across the East Bay. And in a video

    for vehicles by several identifying categories, including their “type, make, color,
    license plate state, missing/covered plates,” as well as bumper stickers, decals

    a really significant amount of location data is now going to be in the hands of
