- en: Optimistic thinking has long been immortalized in self-help books as the key
    to happiness, good health and longevity but it can also lead to poor decision
    making, with particularly serious implications for people’s financial wellbeing.

  zh: 长久以来，乐观思维被描绘在自助书籍中，被视为幸福、健康和长寿的关键，但它也可能导致决策失误，对人们的财务福祉尤为严重的影响。
- en: Research from the University of Bath shows that excessive optimism is actually
    associated with lower cognitive skills such as verbal fluency, fluid reasoning,
    numerical reasoning, and memory. Whereas those high on cognitive ability tend
    to be both more realistic and pessimistic in their expectations about the future.

  zh: 来自巴斯大学的研究显示，过度乐观实际上与较低的认知能力相关，如口头流畅、流体推理、数理推理和记忆力。而那些认知能力高的人在对未来的期望中往往更加现实和悲观。
- en: '“Forecasting the future with accuracy is difficult and for that reason we night
    expect those with low cognitive ability to make more errors in judgments, both
    pessimistic and optimistic. But the results are clear: low cognitive ability leads
    to more self-flattering biases - people essentially deluding themselves to a degree.”

  zh: “准确预测未来是困难的，因此我们可能会期望那些认知能力较低的人在判断中犯更多错误，无论是悲观还是乐观。但结果很明显：认知能力低会导致更多自我膨胀的偏见——人们在某种程度上自欺欺人。”
    英国巴斯大学管理学院的 [Chris Dawson 博士](https://researchportal.bath.ac.uk/en/persons/chris-dawson)
    表示。
- en: “This points to the idea that whilst humans may be primed by evolution to expect
    the best, those high on cognitive ability are more able to override this automatic
    response when it comes to important decisions. Plans based on overly optimistic
    beliefs make for poor decisions and are bound to deliver worse outcomes than would
    realistic beliefs,” Dr Dawson added.

    of consumption and debt, as well as insufficient savings. It can also lead to
    excessive business entries and subsequent failures. The chances of starting a
    successful business are tiny, but optimists always think they have a shot and
    will start businesses destined to fail,” Dr Dawson said.

  zh: “不切实际乐观的财务期望可能导致过度消费和债务，以及储蓄不足。它还可能导致过多的企业进入和随后的失败。成功创业的机会微乎其微，但乐观主义者总是认为他们有机会创办注定失败的企业，”Dawson

    Financial Expectations”](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/01461672231209400)
    - took data from a UK survey of over 36,000 households and looked at people’s
    expectations of their financial wellbeing and compared them with their actual
    financial outcomes. The research found that those highest on cognitive ability
    experienced a 22% increase in the probability of “realism” and a 35 per cent decrease
    in the probability of “extreme optimism”.'
