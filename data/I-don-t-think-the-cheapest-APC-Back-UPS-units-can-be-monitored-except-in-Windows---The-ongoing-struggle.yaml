    bothered with a UPS at home. Our power grid is very reliable. Looking at availability
    information from “[uptimed](https://github.com/rpodgorny/uptimed)“, my home file
    server has been powered on for 99.97% of the time in the last 14 years. That includes

    their cheapest offering. Many people were dismissive calling them cheap pieces

    and I felt it hard to justify paying a lot here.

- en: I found YouTube videos of the procedure that a technician would go through to
    replace the battery in 3 to 5 years. To do it yourself voids your warranty, but
    your warranty is done after 3 years anyway. It looked pretty doable even for a
    hardware-avoidant person like myself.

- en: 'It’s important to me that the UPS can be monitored by a Linux computer. The
    entire point here is that the computer detects when the battery is near to exhausted

- en: Looking at the Back-UPS BX1600MI model, it has a USB port for monitoring and
    says it can be monitored with APC’s own Powerchute Serial Shutdown Windows software.
    There’s an entry in **nut**‘s hardware compatibility list for “Back-UPS (USB)”
    of “supported, based on publicly available protocol”. I made the order.

    stream of battery detach/reattach and power fail/restore events each lasting less
    than 2 seconds. Normally on a power fail you’d expect a visual and audible alert
    on the UPS itself and I wasn’t getting any of that, but I don’t know if that’s
    because they were real events that were just too brief.

  zh: 我尝试使用**apcupsd**。它保持连接，但显示一连串电池分离/重新连接以及电源故障/恢复事件，每次不到2秒。通常在停电时，你期望UPS本身有视觉和听觉警报，但我没有收到任何信息，不过我不知道这是否因为这些事件太短暂了。

- en: In the mean time I found time to install Windows 10 in a virtual machine and
    pass through USB to it. Guess what? No spurious events in PCSS on Windows. It
