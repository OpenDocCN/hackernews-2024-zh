    first reported. The electric automaker is cutting “more than 10%” of its global
    headcount, Musk said in the email. Tesla finished 2023 [with over 140,000 employees](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1318605/000162828024002390/tsla-20231231.htm),

    报道。这家电动汽车制造商正裁减其全球总员工数的“超过10%”，马斯克在电子邮件中称。特斯拉在2023年结束时的员工人数超过14万人，这意味着裁员可能会影响超过14,000人。

    drop in sales](https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/02/tesla-sales-drop-first-quarter-estimates-deliveries/)
    in three years, amid a wider cooling of demand for EVs. The company has warned
    investors that sales growth could be “notably lower” in 2024 than its stated goal
    of 50% growth each year. It’s also somewhat in between product cycles for the
    first time in years, with the expensive Cybertruck only just recently going into
    production and the popular Model Y entering its fourth year without any significant
    updates.

    后两周，马斯克宣布了裁员计划，这是在电动车需求普遍降温的背景下发生的。该公司已警告投资者，2024年的销售增长可能明显低于每年50%的目标。同时，特斯拉产品周期有所改变，昂贵的赛博卡车刚刚开始生产，而受欢迎的
    Model Y 已进入第四个年头，没有任何重大更新。

    to look at every aspect of the company for cost reductions and increasing productivity,”
    Musk said in the email. Tesla’s growth, he said, has led to “duplication of roles
    and job functions in certain areas.”

    in the past year, as Tesla CFO Zachary Kirkhorn stepped down in [August 2023](https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/07/tesla-cfo-master-of-coin-zachary-kirkhorn-steps-down/).
    Baglino oversaw engineering for the company’s powertrain and battery technologies.
    He also had become one of the more responsive executives on Musk’s social media
    platform. Patel, who spent years as a special assistant to President Barack Obama
    and an advisor on climate and energy, was similarly engaging with Tesla customers
    and fans in recent months.
