    million after making a successful pivot into billing — a space it discovered was
    even more broken among potential customers. [Lago](https://www.getlago.com), developer
    of an open source billing platform, has picked up the funding across two rounds
    of funding it’s revealing to coincide with its official launch.

    during which it’s picked up a number of notable startups such as Mistral.ai, Together.ai
    and Juni as early customers. The company’s focus on open source is very intentional,
    said CEO Anh-Tho Chuong: It’s targeting developers who are looking for solutions
    to tailor their billing to fit whatever cutting-edge, creative new services they
    are cooking up, a gap in the market that Lago believes is not being addressed
    well enough by incumbents, and which Lago is betting might best be addressed through
    an open source approach.'

    That leads to many companies (as Qonto did) building their own solutions. “But
    engineers hate it. And it’s very expensive to hire engineers for that, obviously.
    So it’s still an unsolved problem.” In Lago’s view, offering open source tools
    is that best solution to meet a variety of needs and ideas.
