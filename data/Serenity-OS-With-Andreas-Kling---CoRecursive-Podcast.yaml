    an operating system? My answer is I wouldn’t. First off, I don’t know how. And
    the second thing is Googling around, the best estimate seems to be that it took

    from an empty Git repository. And I’m running it right now, and I’m looking at
    it. There’s a web browser, and there’s Solitaire. It’s like an alternate world
    version of the Windows 95 that I grew up using, built from scratch. Really from

    it’s much easier to look at that objectively and say, “Well, that’s not good behavior.”
    And then when you suddenly encounter a lot of these stories of bad behavior, you
    start to build almost a sense of morality. Once you have that, it’s much easier
    to eventually relate your own experiences through that sense of morality. That’s
    something that we talked a lot about in the rehab program that I went to, how
    addiction leads to a moral bankruptcy basically. And one of the important things
    to do in rehab and recovery is to help people build a new sense of morality because
