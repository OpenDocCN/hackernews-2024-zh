    designed an experiment to detect neutrinos, the tiniest and most elusive of subatomic
    particles. Theorists were convinced that neutrinos must exist — and that they
    would be untraceable. And Reines liked nothing better than a challenge.

- en: The experiment was to take place in the Nevada desert. A flux of neutrinos would
    be created by detonating a 20-kiloton nuclear bomb, comparable to that dropped
    on Hiroshima, Japan, a few years earlier. A deep hole would be dug 40 metres away
    from the detonation site, into which a detector would be dropped at the moment
    of explosion to catch the flux at its maximum.

- en: Eminent physicists enthused about the plan. It was approved by Reines’s employer,
    the government-funded Los Alamos laboratory in New Mexico. Work began on the detector,
    nicknamed El Monstro, and on the construction of the shaft. At the last minute,
    Reines and Cowan transferred the experiment to a nuclear reactor, but not because
    of environmental or safety concerns. They had worked out that although the reactor
    would deliver a flux of neutrinos three orders of magnitude lower than that from
    the bomb, it offered a better option for distinguishing signal from noise.

    outlandish, but in Chasing the Ghost, his biography of Reines, Leonard Cole reminds
    us that attitudes were different then. He also reminds us of this when describing
    Reines’s work on nuclear bombs during and after the Second World War, and his
    creation of a neutrino laboratory deep in a gold mine in South Africa in the 1960s,
    in defiance of academic sanctions against the apartheid state. (However, Cole
    is hardly an independent voice, being Reines’s admiring younger cousin.)

    scientists, many now in their nineties, who worked with him. He builds a picture
    of a larger-than-life figure who conducted larger-than-life experiments. The man

    of the world’s top physicists. Most left Los Alamos after the war; not Reines.

    Ocean — and on the development of the even more powerful hydrogen bomb.

    years later, he moved to the University of California, Irvine. At Case, he began
    a search for natural-source neutrinos, for which he had to build an underground

    Some other African countries alleged that it intended to test nuclear weapons
    underground. As that issue faded, problems arose at home, writes Cole. In 1968,
    colleagues at Irvine openly challenged academic collaboration in an explicitly
    racist country. Reines countered that, in his view, science transcended politics.
    Still, he wound down research at the mine soon afterwards, and continued his neutrino

    results. But he was a hands-off, respectful lab chief who addressed his team with
    old-fashioned formality as ‘Mr’ (they seem to have all been men) — even as he
    ignored their rights to holidays. Those interviewed all tell how they fell under
