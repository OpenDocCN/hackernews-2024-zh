- en: A few months ago, I told a chef in Vancouver that he would soon experience major
    growth in his career and take on much more responsibility, and that the letter
    B would somehow be involved. How did I know? Some cheese told me. He’d been standing
    next to a particularly veiny piece of blue cheese, and asked me to read his fortune
    from it. Predicting the future using cheese is something I do as a side business,
    and from what I can tell, there aren’t very many of us doing this anymore.

  zh: 几个月前，我告诉了温哥华的一位厨师，他的职业生涯将很快迎来重大增长，并承担更多责任，并且字母B将以某种方式涉及其中。我是怎么知道的？一些起司告诉了我。他站在一个特别多纹理的蓝纹奶酪旁边，让我从中读出他的命运。用起司预测未来是我的副业，据我所知，这种做法已经不多见了。
- en: 'This isn’t some cheesy divination method I just made up. Tyromancy, or the
    practice of telling fortunes with cheese, was [first](https://www.theawl.com/2016/08/the-library-of-dreams/)
    [officially mentioned](https://www.theawl.com/2016/08/the-library-of-dreams/)
    in the second century in the writings of Greek historian and professional diviner
    Artemidorus of Daldis (also known as Artimedorus of Ephesus) on dream interpretation.
    He apparently didn’t think cheese was a great invention: he noted at the time
    that the food signifies “trickery and ambushes” and that tyromancers sullied the
    work of true diviners like sacrificers and liver examiners. Tyromancers, he argued,
    were more in league with those who practiced evil types of divination, including
    dice diviners and necromancers. It feels like a bit of a leap to go from cheese
    to death, but Artimedorus had some opinions, I guess.'

  zh: 这并不是我随便编造的一种俗气的占卜方法。起司占卜，或者用起司来算命的做法，[最早](https://www.theawl.com/2016/08/the-library-of-dreams/)是在公元二世纪，希腊历史学家和专业占卜师达尔迪斯的亚尔忒弥斯多罗斯（又称以弗所的亚尔忒弥斯多罗斯）关于梦的解释的著作中[正式提及](https://www.theawl.com/2016/08/the-library-of-dreams/)的。他似乎不认为起司是一种伟大的发明：他当时指出这种食物意味着“欺诈和埋伏”，而起司占卜者败坏了真正占卜者（如祭司和观察肝脏的人）的工作。他认为，起司占卜者更倾向于那些从事邪恶类型占卜的人，包括掷骰子的人和通灵者。从起司到死亡似乎有点跳跃，但亚尔忒弥斯多罗斯有些看法，我猜是这样。
- en: Tyromancy reached peak popularity in England during the Middle Ages and early
    modern period (1500–1800). The country was primarily an agrarian society at the
    time, with most families having some sort of livestock that produced milk for
    cheese—and people loved to dabble in the paranormal. Christianity was ingrained
    in most people, so looking for insight into one’s predestined future, or trying
    to find a way to gain control over it, led to widespread interest in divination.
    One used whatever tools were on hand to achieve that, and at that particular point
    in history, that meant cheese. It was a much more convenient choice than previous
    divination methods, which included dumping a ladle of molten lead into a bucket
    of water to see what shapes it made.

  zh: 起司占卜在英格兰在中世纪和早期现代时期（1500年至1800年）达到了顶峰。当时，这个国家主要是一个农业社会，大多数家庭都有一些生产奶酪的家畜——人们热衷于涉足超自然领域。大多数人都信奉基督教，所以寻找对命运的洞察力，或试图找到控制命运的方法，导致人们对占卜产生了广泛的兴趣。人们使用任何手头上的工具来实现这一目标，在那个特定的历史时期，这意味着起司。与以前的占卜方法相比，这是一个更方便的选择，以前的方法包括在水桶里倾倒一勺熔化的铅，看看它造成了什么形状。
- en: 'People used cheese to divine all sorts of things: who committed a crime, whether
    the year would bring a fruitful harvest, and how a child’s life would turn out.
    Those who practiced it generally used farmer’s cheese, though some tried it with
    runnier options, like fondue.'

  zh: 人们用起司来算命各种各样的事情：谁犯了罪，今年是否会有丰收的季节，以及一个孩子的生活会如何发展。那些从事这种做法的人通常使用农夫奶酪，尽管有些人尝试用更稀薄的选择，比如火锅。
- en: Back then, a typical use for tyromancy was to determine who you would marry.
    You’d simply carve the names of all potential suitors into some pieces of cheese,
    then wait to see which one molded first. And there it was—your life partner! People
    also analyzed the number and size of holes in a block of cheese, the patterns
    of the mold and veins, and the shapes that curds made as they coagulated. The
    process is similar to that of reading tea leaves or coffee grounds—you tell a
    story through the shapes you see. A heart shape, for example, signifies love and
    happiness, while an odd number of holes predicts that something negative might
    happen.

  zh: 那时候，奶酪占卜的一个典型用途是确定你将要嫁给谁。你只需将所有潜在求婚者的名字刻在一些奶酪片上，然后等待看哪一个先发霉。然后，你的终身伴侣就在那里！人们还分析奶酪块中的孔洞数量和大小，霉菌和血管的图案，以及凝固时凝结物形成的形状。这个过程类似于读茶叶或咖啡渣的过程——你通过看到的形状来讲述一个故事。例如，心形象征着爱情和幸福，而奇数个孔预示着可能会发生一些负面的事情。
- en: During the early modern years, tyromancy’s popularity began to wane. After the
    1920s, cheese fortune-telling essentially disappeared—perhaps in part due to the
    swift rise of tarot after the invention of the well-known [Rider-Waite deck](https://www.tarot.com/tarot/decks/rider)
    in 1909\. Save for occasional pop-culture references, like in the video game series
    “The Witcher” and “Baldur’s Gate”, tyromancy became largely unknown.

  zh: 在近代早期，奶酪占卜的流行开始减弱。20世纪20年代之后，奶酪占卜基本上消失了——或许部分原因是由于在1909年发明了著名的[Rider-Waite牌](https://www.tarot.com/tarot/decks/rider)后，塔罗迅速崛起。除了偶尔在视频游戏系列“巫师”和“鲍德尔之门”中的流行文化参考之外，奶酪占卜几乎变得默默无闻。
- en: Today, tyromancy still lingers in the realm of obscurity, though I’m trying
    to change that by leading workshops and one-on-one sessions to teach people how
    to read their own cheese. Since launching these classes during the pandemic, they’ve
    been selling out, which I attribute in part to the popularity of WitchTok and
    the general feelings of uncertainty created by COVID-19.

  zh: 如今，奶酪占卜仍然停留在晦涩的领域中，尽管我正在通过主持研讨会和一对一会议来改变这种情况，教人们如何读懂他们自己的奶酪。自从在疫情期间推出这些课程以来，它们一直供不应求，其中部分原因归功于WitchTok的流行以及COVID-19所带来的普遍不确定感。
- en: In the years I’ve been tyromancing, I’ve figured out ways to read just about
    any type of cheese. Those with patterns on the surface are best, but you can always
    break a chunk in half and analyze the variations along the break. You can also
    use crumbles by dumping them out on a plate. I’ve even read a fortune from a Kraft
    Singles slice—but the person for whom I was reading had to tear it up and drop
    it onto a plate first. Vegan cheese? No problem.

  zh: 在我从事奶酪占卜的这些年里，我已经找到了一些方法来读取几乎任何类型的奶酪。表面有图案的奶酪最好，但你总可以将一块奶酪折断一半，分析沿着折断线的变化。你还可以通过将碎块倒在盘子上来使用碎屑。我甚至曾经读取过Kraft
    Singles片的预测——但我要为我读取的人先将其撕碎并放在盘子上。素食奶酪？没问题。

    around the table to hug me and take a photo. Apparently he had been planning a
