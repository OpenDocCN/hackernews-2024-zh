    probably say something about their function in preserving the history of how past
    conflicts and wars were fought, rather than their importance in contributing to
    wars in the present. However, experts and archivists at [The Tank Museum](https://tankmuseum.org/)
    in the U.K. have been busy putting their knowledge and historical materials to
    work for the benefit of Ukraine, in order to reverse-engineer a number of Soviet-era
    armored vehicle and tank tracks to send to the country as it continues to fight
    against Russian invaders.

    combined analyses of incomplete Soviet-era drawings, contemporary manuals, and
