    said that if you’ve never really spoken another language, then the best strategy
    is to start with the easiest possible language to learn, which is [Esperanto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esperanto).
    His advice is to spend just a few weeks learning and having conversations in Esperanto,
    so that you can feel the experience of detaching from your mother tongue. Then
    you’ll be better-prepared to go learn the language you really want to learn.

    look into Esperanto.” I sat down mid-afternoon and checked out [lernu.net](https://lernu.net/),
    which seemed to be the most popular Esperanto-learning site. And oh my god! It’s
    fascinating! The language is so well designed! Everything made sense and with
    each new thing I learned, I thought “That’s brilliant!”, and wanted to learn more.

    and there was an annual Esperanto conference in Seoul Korea in July, so I signed
    up to attend the conference and made that my deadline for fluency. I found an
    [Esperanto teacher](https://www.frenchfluency.net/), signed up for live conversation
    practice, and started learning for one to three hours a day. I was a keen and
    diligent student, and had Esperanto books shipped from overseas, which I read
    slowly, learning new vocabulary. I watched [videos in Esperanto](https://www.youtube.com/@Evildea)
    made by a funny Australian dude. I used [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) flashcards,
    and wrote my own command-line dictionary for quick reference of every word I’d
    learned. I was so into it that my friend [Elina](https://www.storyo.co.nz/about)
    got annoyed and asked if I could please stop talking about it so much.
