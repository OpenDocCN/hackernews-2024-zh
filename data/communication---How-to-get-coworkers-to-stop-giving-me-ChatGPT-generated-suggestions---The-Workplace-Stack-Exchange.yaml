- en: I take the time to understand and consider each suggestion, not rejecting anything
    out of hand, and share them with my team members (of which there are 17). Their
    advice has been, thus far, to "just ignore". However, I would not like to treat
    my co-workers that way.

  zh: 我会花时间去理解和考虑每一个建议，不会轻易拒绝任何东西，并与我的团队成员（共 17 人）分享它们。到目前为止，他们的建议是“只需忽略”。然而，我不想那样对待我的同事。
- en: Sounds like you need to break that pattern, but also you don't necessarily want
    to be the hammer that drops in order to break it - as that rarely gets received
    in a friendly fashion, especially when they are used to just getting you to answer
    and consider the ideas.

  zh: 听起来你需要打破那种模式，但你也不一定想成为打破它的锤子 - 因为那很少会以友好的方式接受，特别是当他们习惯了只是让你回答和考虑这些想法时。
- en: The solution in that case is quite simple - reach out to your boss/manager,
    explain that while you appreciate the suggestions, they are not helpful (have
    example or two ready here), they drain a lot of your time and focus (example or
    two) but also that you do not wish to be rude to your well-meaning co-workers
    (keep your face straight saying that) and ask them to step in and be the hammer
    to curtail the flow of unhelpful and uneducated advice. Focus on the points you
    can easily prove - that the advice is wrong and it's a time drain - don't go into
    motives or anything else.

  zh: 在这种情况下的解决方案非常简单 - 联系你的老板/经理，解释虽然你欣赏这些建议，但它们并不有用（在这里准备一两个例子），它们耗费了你大量的时间和注意力（一两个例子），但你也不希望对善意的同事粗鲁（保持面带微笑地说）。要求他们介入并成为削减无益和不合适建议流的工具。专注于你可以轻易证明的点
    - 建议是错误的，并且是时间的浪费 - 不要涉及动机或其他任何事情。
- en: Ultimately that's the best way, as you are not in the place to tell them what
    to do, just as they cannot really tell you how to resolve an issue, and trying
    to pull some imaginary rank would likely alienate relationships further, and speaking
    in friendly way for them to see error of their way was dismissed. So time to call
    the actual powers to be, and let them manage as they are hired to do.

  zh: 最终这是最好的方式，因为你没有权力告诉他们该做什么，就像他们实际上也无法告诉你如何解决问题一样，试图拉拢一些想象中的权力可能会进一步疏远关系，并且以友好的方式告诉他们看到他们的错误被忽视了。所以现在是召唤真正有权力的人，并让他们像他们被聘用的那样管理的时候了。
- en: If the drain then continues, raise it with your boss/manager again.

- en: If you have a boss that will not act on well documented time waste (even if
    its coming from a good place) and instead will drive you towards the time waste,
    that's a great thing to find out as soon as possible, and a whole other problem
    to rectify. But at least you will be aware that the problem exists now, and can
    address it.

  zh: 如果你有一个老板不会采取行动来消除充分记录的时间浪费（即使它是出于善意的），而是会推动你去浪费时间，那么尽快发现这一点是一件很好的事情，也是一个完全不同的问题要纠正。但至少你现在意识到问题存在了，并且可以解决它。
