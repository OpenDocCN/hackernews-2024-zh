    misleading consumers about the conclusion of sales contracts on its online marketplace.
    The sanction, of close to $8 million (or in local currency: PLN 31,850,141), also
    calls out the e-commerce giant for deceptive design elements which may inject
    a false sense of urgency into the purchasing process and mislead shoppers about

    into complaints about Amazon’s sales practices since September 2021, following
    complaints from shoppers, including some who did not receive their purchases.
    The authority opened a formal investigation into Amazon’s practices in [February
    2023](https://techcrunch.com/2023/02/01/amazon-polish-consumer-protection-investigation/).
    Wednesday’s sanction is the conclusion of that probe.

  zh: 该国的消费者与竞争监管机构UOKiK自2021年9月起开始调查关于亚马逊销售行为的投诉，包括一些未收到购买产品的投诉。该机构于[2023年2月](https://techcrunch.com/2023/02/01/amazon-polish-consumer-protection-investigation/)正式对亚马逊的做法展开调查。本周三的处罚是该调查的结论。
- en: The UOKiK found consumers who ordered products on Amazon could have their purchases
    subsequently cancelled by the tech giant as it does not treat the moment of purchase
    as the conclusion of a sales contract, despite sending consumers confirmation
    of their order — even after consumers have paid for the product. For Amazon, the
    conclusion of a sales contract only occurs once it has sent information about
    the actual shipment.

  zh: 波兰竞争与消费者保护局（UOKiK）发现，在亚马逊上订购产品的消费者可能会因为技术巨头将购买随后取消而受到影响，尽管消费者已经支付了产品费用，但亚马逊并不将购买时刻视为销售合同的成立，尽管向消费者发送了订单确认。对于亚马逊而言，销售合同的成立仅在其发送有关实际发货信息后才发生。
- en: In a [press release](https://uokik.gov.pl/31-mln-zl-kary-dla-amazon) detailing
    the enforcement, it said Amazon failed to clearly communicate this salient detail
    to shoppers, finding it only provided the information at “the last stage of purchase”.
    It also found the information was sometimes “difficult” for consumers to access,
    noting for example Amazon could use a grey font on a white background in text
    displayed at the very bottom of a page — a classic example of so-called ‘[dark
    pattern design](https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/01/wtf-is-dark-pattern-design/)‘.

    —— 这是所谓“黑暗模式设计”的典型例子。
- en: The UOKiK contrasts that deceptive design choice with suggestive messaging Amazon
    shows to shoppers on sales buttons — which read “Buy now” or “Proceed to finalize
    the purchase” — which it said imply that by ordering the product the shopper is
    concluding a contract with Amazon. Which is not, in fact, the case.

  zh: UOKiK将这种欺骗性设计选择与亚马逊向购物者展示的暗示性信息进行对比，这些信息显示在销售按钮上：“立即购买”或“进入购买确认” —— 它声称这意味着购买产品的消费者正在与亚马逊达成合同。而事实并非如此。
- en: '“Thus, Amazon misleads consumers as to the moment of conclusion of the sales
    contract,” the authority wrote [in Polish; this is a machine translation]. “For
    many people, this can also have negative consequences: The consumer does not receive
    the product, so he cannot use it, he loses the opportunity to buy at an attractive
    price that may no longer apply, and his money is frozen until he returns it.”'

- en: Some of the complaints it received also found information about how to cancel
    an order may be provided long after it was placed, with the UOKiK citing the case
    of cancellations of e-book reader orders where the critical detail was not provided

    and delivery windows — such as by listing how many items were in stock to be purchased
    and providing a countdown clock to order an item in order to get it on a particular
    delivery date. Its investigation found Amazon does not always meet these deadlines
    for orders, nor ship products immediately as they may be out of stock despite
    claims to the contrary shown to consumers.

  zh: 它的执法还指责亚马逊利用欺骗性设计鼓励购物者点击购买，通过提供有关产品可供性和交货窗口的误导信息，例如列出可购买的库存数量，并提供一个倒计时时钟，以在特定的交货日期获取商品。调查发现，亚马逊并非总能按时交付订单，也不会立即发货，尽管向消费者展示相反的声明。
- en: '“Amazon treats the data it provides on availability and shipping date as indicative
    but the way it is presented does not indicate this,” the UOKiK noted, adding:
    “Consumers can only find out about this in the terms of sale on the platform.”'

    about product availability and its fast shipping is very valuable for consumers
    and for many people it may be the main reason why they make a purchase decision.
    However, such information cannot be a lure. If the entrepreneur provides a specific
    delivery date, he or she must meet it. This practice by Amazon is classified as
    so-called dark patterns because it uses pressure to make the consumer order the
    product as soon as possible.”'

- en: While Amazon *does* offer a delivery guarantee — offering a refund if items
    do not ship within the stated time — the authority found it failed to provide
    consumers with information about the rules of this service before placing an order.
    It only offers details at the order summary stage. And then only “if the consumer
    decides to read the subsequent links specifying delivery details.”

- en: Shoppers who did not follow the link to read more may not have been aware of
    their right to apply for and receive a refund from Amazon if there is a delay
