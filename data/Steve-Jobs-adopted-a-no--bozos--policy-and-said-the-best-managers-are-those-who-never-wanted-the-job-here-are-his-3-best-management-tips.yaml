- en: 'Jobs’ comment gets at the crux of a central debate in management: whether managers
    should actually want to be managers or not. Jobs argued the people who were least
    expecting to be leaders ended up being the best managers in the long run. That’s
    because other employees were more likely to actually learn something from them
    because they’ve mastered that skill—rather than only focusing on management techniques.'

- en: Apple was “betting on a lot of things” when it made her a financial manager,
    Coleman said. They were “betting that my skills and organizational effectiveness
    override” her lack of tech and manufacturing experience. Coleman went on to become
    chief financial officer of Apple and was referred to as one of Silicon Valley’s
