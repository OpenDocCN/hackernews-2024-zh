    much as four inches of tilt correction within six months after the leaning high-rise
    was anchored on two sides to bedrock.

  zh: 设计用于预测塔行为的高级模型曾预测，这座倾斜的高层大厦在锚定到基岩的两侧后，六个月内可纠正多达四英寸的倾斜。
- en: While the tower is no longer sinking anymore at the corner, and has reversed
    some settlement there, data shows there’s only been about an inch of tilt reversal,
    a quarter of what the model had predicted.

  zh: 虽然该塔不再在角落处下沉，而且已经在那里逆转了一些沉降，数据显示仅有约一英寸的倾斜逆转，仅为模型预测的四分之一。

    the theory that once supported on the north and west, the tower’s newly shifted
    weight would cause it to settle more on its east and south sides.

    sides, the tower appears to be sinking more in the center.

    at the center an overall rate of about a tenth of an inch a year.

    steel reinforcement. Rusted steel expands and that can trigger more damage to
    the cracked concrete.

  zh: 他表示，修复预计会在未来继续扭转更多的倾斜，但由于意外的土壤响应，不会以模型预测的速度进行。
- en: The “remainder of the building continues to settle as we always anticipated,
    resulting in tilt recovery, albeit it at [a] slightly lower rate,” than modeling
    predicted, Hamburger said. “We believe this lower rate of settlement is because
    stress relief of the soils under the building has been more effective than originally
    forecast.”
