- en: McSorley’s occupies the ground floor of a red brick tenement at 15 Seventh Street,
    just off Cooper Square, where the Bowery ends. It was opened in 1854 and is the
    oldest saloon in the city. In eighty-six years it has had four owners—an Irish
    immigrant, his son, a retired policeman, and his daughter—and all of them have
    been opposed to change. It is equipped with electricity, but the bar is stubbornly
    illuminated with a pair of gas lamps, which flicker fitfully and throw shadows
    on the low, cobwebby ceiling each time someone opens the street door. There is
    no cash register. Coins are dropped in soup bowls—one for nickels, one for dimes,
    one for quarters, and one for halves—and bills are kept in a rosewood cashbox.
    It is a drowsy place; the bartenders never make a needless move, the customers
    nurse their mugs of ale, and the three clocks on the walls have not been in agreement
    for many years. The clientele is motley. It includes mechanics from the many garages
    in the neighborhood, salesmen from the restaurant-supply houses on Cooper Square,
    truck-drivers from Wanamakers’s, internes from Bellevue, students from Cooper
    Union, clerks from the row of secondhand bookshops north of Astor Place, and men
    with tiny pensions who live in hotels on the Bowery but are above drinking in
    the bars on that street. The backbone of the clientele, however, is a rapidly
    thinning group of crusty old men, predominantly Irish, who have been drinking
    there since they were youths and now have a proprietary feeling toward the place.
    Some of these veterans clearly remember John McSorley, the founder, who died in
    1910 at the age of eighty-seven. They refer to him as Old John, and they like
    to sit in rickety armchairs around the big belly stove which heats the place,
    gnaw on the stems of their pipes, and talk about him.

  zh: 麦克索利酒吧位于第七街15号，一座红砖公寓的底层，就在库珀广场旁边，鲍威利街的尽头。它于1854年开业，是该市最古老的酒吧。在八十六年的历史中，它已经换了四个主人——一个爱尔兰移民，他的儿子，一名退役警察及他的女儿——所有人都反对改变。酒吧有电灯，但吧台顽固地由一对煤气灯照明，灯光摇曳不定，每次有人打开街门时，在低矮、布满蜘蛛网的天花板上投下阴影。没有收银机。硬币被投入汤碗里——一个装镍币，一个装一角硬币，一个装二角五分硬币，一个装五角硬币——账单则放在一只红木的钱箱里。这是一个昏昏欲睡的地方；调酒师从不多此一举，顾客们则小口啜饮他们的麦酒，墙上的三个时钟多年来始终没有达成一致。客人来自各行各业，包括邻近的许多修车厂的技工、库珀广场上的餐饮供应店的销售员、万纳梅克百货公司的卡车司机、贝尔维尤医院的实习生、库珀联盟大学的学生、阿斯特街北部二手书店街的职员以及在鲍威利街上的酒店居住但不喝酒的那些小退休金的人。然而，客户群体的中坚是一群迅速减少的硬派老人，主要是爱尔兰人，他们从年轻时起就在这里喝酒，现在对这个地方有一种所有权的感觉。其中一些老兵清楚地记得麦克索利的创始人约翰·麦克索利，他于1910年去世，享年87岁。他们称他为老约翰，喜欢围坐在温暖酒吧的大肚炉边摇晃的扶手椅上，咀嚼烟斗的管柄，并且谈论他的事迹。
- en: Old John was quirky. He was normally affable but was subject to spells of unaccountable
    surliness during which he would refuse to answer when spoken to. He went bald
    in early manhood and began wearing scraggly, patriarchal sideburns before he was
    forty. Many photographs of him are in existence, and it is obvious that he had
    a lot of unassumed dignity. He patterned his saloon after a public house he had
    known in Ireland and originally called it the Old House at Home; around 1908 the
    signboard blew down, and when he ordered a new one he changed the name to McSorley’s
    Old Ale House. That is still the official name; customers never have called it
    anything but McSorley’s. Old John believed it impossible for men to drink with
    tranquillity in the presence of women; there is a fine back room in the saloon,
    but for many years a sign was nailed on the street door, saying, “Notice. No Back
    Room in Here for Ladies.” In McSorley’s entire history, in fact, the only woman
    customer ever willingly admitted was an addled old peddler called Mother Fresh-Roasted,
    who claimed her husband died from the bite of a lizard in Cuba during the Spanish-American
    War and who went from saloon to saloon on the lower East Side for a couple of
    generations hawking peanuts, which she carried in her apron. On warm days, Old
    John would sell her an ale, and her esteem for him was such that she embroidered
    him a little American flag and gave it to him one Fourth of July; he had it framed
    and placed it on the wall above his brassbound ale pump, and it is still there.
    When other women came in, Old John would hurry forward, make a bow, and say, “Madam,
    I’m sorry, but we don’t serve ladies.” This technique is still used.

- en: In his time, Old John catered to the Irish and German workingmen—carpenters,
    tanners, bricklayers, slaughter-house butchers, teamsters, and brewers—who populated
    the Seventh Street neighborhood, selling ale in pewter mugs at five cents a mug
    and putting out a free lunch inflexibly consisting of soda crackers, raw onions,
    and cheese; present-day customers are wont to complain that some of the cheese
    Old John laid out on opening night in 1854 is still there. Adjacent to the free
    lunch he kept a quart crock of tobacco and a rack of clay and corncob pipes—the
    purchase of an ale entitled a man to a smoke on the house; the rack still holds
    a few of the communal pipes. Old John was thrifty and was able to buy the tenement—it
    is five stories high and holds eight families —about ten years after he opened
    the saloon in it. He distrusted banks and always kept his money in a cast-iron
    safe; it still stands in the back room, but its doors are loose on their hinges
    and there is nothing in it but an accumulation of expired saloon licences and
    several McSorley heirlooms, including Old John’s straight razor. He lived with
    his family in a flat directly over the saloon and got up every morning at five;
    he walked to the Battery and back before breakfast, no matter what the weather.
    He unlocked the saloon at seven, swept it out himself, and spread sawdust on the
    floor. Until he became too feeble to manage a racing sulky, he always kept a horse
    and a nanny goat in a stable around the corner on St. Mark’s Place. He kept both
    animals in the same stall, believing, like many horse-lovers, that horses should
    have company at night. During the lull in the afternoon a stable-hand would lead
    the horse around to a hitching block in front of the saloon, and Old John, wearing
    his bar apron, would stand on the curb and groom the animal. A customer who wanted
    service would tap on the window and Old John would drop his currycomb, step inside,
    draw an ale, and return at once to the horse. On Sundays he entered sulky races
    on uptown highways.

  zh: 在他的时代，老约翰为居住在第七街附近的爱尔兰和德国工人们提供服务 —— 木匠、制革工、砖匠、屠宰场屠夫、车夫和酿酒师 —— 以五分钱一杯在锡杯中出售啤酒，并提供由苏打饼干、生洋葱和奶酪组成的免费午餐；现今的顾客常抱怨，1854年开业之夜老约翰摆出的一些奶酪至今仍然未曾动过。在免费午餐的旁边，他放置了一个夸脱的烟草坛子和一排粘土和玉米杆烟斗
    —— 购买一杯啤酒就可以享受免费的一支烟；烟斗架上依然保留着几只共用的烟斗。老约翰很节俭，在他开业约十年后，他就能买下这座公寓 —— 公寓高五层，住着八户人家。他不信任银行，总是把钱放在一座铸铁保险箱里；保险箱至今仍放在后房，但门铰链已经松动，里面什么都没有，只是一堆过期的酒吧执照和几件麦克索利家族的传家宝，包括老约翰的剃刀。他和家人住在酒吧楼上的一套公寓里，每天早上五点起床；不论天气如何，他都会在吃早餐之前步行到巴特里公园来回。他七点开门，亲自打扫，把锯末撒在地板上。直到他因年迈而无法再操纵赛车的马车时，他总是在圣马克广场附近的一个马厩里养着一匹马和一只母山羊。他把两只动物关在同一个栏位里，像许多马爱好者一样，他认为马在晚上应该有伴。下午间隙时，一个马厩工人会把马带到酒吧前面的系马石旁边，老约翰穿着他的吧台围裙，站在路边为动物梳理毛发。一位需要服务的顾客会敲窗户，老约翰会放下马刷，走进屋里，倒一杯啤酒，然后立即回到马边。每逢星期天，他都会参加在城外高速公路上的赛车比赛。
- en: From the time he was twenty until he was fifty-five, Old John drank steadily,
    but throughout the last thirty-two years of his life he did not take a drop, saying,
    “I’ve had my share.” Except for a few experimental months in 1905 or 1906, no
    spirits ever have been sold in McSorley’s; Old John maintained that the man never
    lived who needed a stronger drink than a mug of stock ale warmed on the hob of
    a stove. He was a big eater. Customarily, just before locking up for the night,
    he would grill himself a three-pound T-bone, placing it on a coal shovel and holding
    it over a bed of oak coals in the back-room fireplace. He liked to fit a whole
    onion into the hollowed-out heel of a loaf of French bread and eat it as if it
    were an apple. He had an extraordinary appetite for onions, the stronger the better,
    and said that “Good ale, raw onions, and no ladies” was the motto of his saloon.
    About once a month during the winter he presided over an on-the-house beefsteak
    party in the back room, and late in life he was president of an organization of
    gluttons called the Honorable John McSorley Pickle, Baseball Nine, and Chowder
    Club, which held hot-rock clambakes in a picnic grove on North Brother Island
    in the East River. On the walls are a number of photographs taken at outings of
    the club, and in most of them the members are squatting around hogsheads of ale;
    except for the president, they all have drunken, slack-mouthed grins and their
    eyes look dazed. Old John had a bull-frog bass and enjoyed harmonizing; with a
    choir of drunks. His favorite songs were “Muldoon, the Solid Man,” “Swim Out,
    You’re Over Your Head,” “Maggie Murphy’s Home,” and “Since the Soup House Moved
    Away.” These songs were by Harrigan and Hart, who were then called “the Gilbert
    and Sullivan of the U.S.A.” He had great respect for them and was pleased exceedingly
    when, in 1882, they made his saloon the scene of one of their slum comedies; it
    was called “McSorley’s Inflation.”

  zh: 从他二十岁到五十五岁的这段时间里，老约翰一直稳定地喝酒，但在他生命的最后三十二年里，他一滴酒也没有喝过，说：“我已经喝够了。”除了1905或1906年的几个试验性月份外，麦克索利的从未出售过任何烈酒；老约翰坚持认为，没有人需要比一杯放在炉子灶上的股份麦酒更强劲的饮料。他是个大胃王。通常在锁店前的晚上，他会烤一个三磅重的T骨牛排，将其放在煤铲上，悬挂在后房的橡木炭火上。他喜欢将整个洋葱塞进法式面包的带皮部分，像吃苹果一样吃掉。他对洋葱有着非凡的胃口，越辣越好，并说：“好麦酒、生洋葱，不需要女士”是他酒吧的座右铭。每个冬天大约一个月，他会在后房主持一个免费牛排宴会，晚年时他还是一个名为“尊敬的约翰·麦克索利腌菜、棒球九人和杂烩俱乐部”的美食家组织的主席，他们在东河北部的北兄弟岛野餐林中举行热岩石烤蛤蜊聚会。墙上挂着一些俱乐部外出时拍摄的照片，在大部分照片中，成员们围坐在大木桶旁；除了主席外，他们都带着醉醺醺、懒散的笑容，眼神迷离。老约翰有着像青蛙一样的低音嗓音，喜欢和一群酒鬼合唱。他最喜欢的歌曲是“穆尔顿，坚实的人”，“游出去，你已经深陷”，“玛吉·墨菲的家”，以及“自从汤屋搬走以来”。这些歌曲是哈里根和哈特创作的，当时被称为“美国的吉尔伯特和沙利文”。他对他们非常尊敬，1882年，当哈里根和哈特把他的酒吧作为一个贫民喜剧的场景时，他感到非常高兴；这出戏名叫“麦克索利的通胀”。
- en: Although by no means a handshaker, Old John knew many prominent men. One of
    his closest friends was Peter Cooper, president of the North American Telegraph
    Company and founder of Cooper Union, which is a half-block west of the saloon.
    Mr. Cooper, in his declining years, spent so many afternoons in the back room
    philosophizing with the workingmen that he was given a chair of his own; it was
    equipped with an inflated rubber cushion. (The chair is still there; each April
    4th for a number of years after Mr. Cooper’s death, on April 4, 1883, it was draped
    with black cloth.) Also, like other steadfast customers, Mr. Cooper had a pewter
    mug on which his name had been engraved with an icepick. He gave the saloon a
    life-sized portrait of himself, which hangs over the mantel in the back room.
    It is a rather appropriate decoration, because, since the beginning of prohibition,
    McSorley’s has been the official saloon of Cooper Union students. Sometimes a
    sentimental student will stand beneath the portrait and drink a toast to Mr. Cooper.

  zh: 虽然老约翰并不是一个喜欢握手的人，但他认识许多显赫的人物。他其中一个最亲密的朋友是彼得·库珀，北美电报公司的总裁，也是库珀联盟的创始人，这个联盟就在这家酒吧的西面半个街区处。库珀先生年老时，经常在后房与工人们进行哲学交流，以至于他被赋予了一把专属的椅子；椅子上配备了一个充气的橡胶垫。（这把椅子至今仍在那里；在库珀先生逝世后的每年4月4日，即1883年4月4日，上面都会覆盖着黑色的布料。）另外，像其他忠实的顾客一样，库珀先生还有一只镀锡的啤酒杯，上面是他的名字，是用冰锥刻上去的。他还给这家酒吧赠送了一幅自己的真人大小画像，悬挂在后房的壁炉架上。这是一个相当合适的装饰，因为从禁酒令开始以来，麦克索利的一直是库珀联盟学生的官方酒吧。有时，一些多愁善感的学生会站在画像下，向库珀先生敬酒。
- en: 'Old John had a remarkable passion for memorabilia. For years he saved the wishbones
    of Thanksgiving and Christmas turkeys and strung them on a rod connecting the
    pair of gas lamps over the bar; the dusty bones are invariably the first thing
    a new customer gets inquisitive about. Not long ago, a Johnny-come-lately infuriated
    one of the bartenders by remarking, “Maybe the old boy believed in voodoo.” Old
    John decorated the partition between barroom and back room with banquet menus,
    autographs, starfish shells, theatre programs, political posters, and worn-down
    shoes taken off the hoofs of various race and brewery horses. Above the entrance
    to the back room he hung; a shillelagh and a sign: “*BE GOOD OR BEGONE.*” On one
    wall of the barroom he placed portraits of horses, steamboats, Tammany bosses,
    jockeys, actors, singers, and assassinated statesmen; there are many excellent
    portraits of Lincoln, Garfield, and McKinley. On the same wall he hung framed
    front pages of old newspapers; one, from the London *Times* for June 22, 1815,
    contains a paragraph on the beginning of the battle of Waterloo, in the lower
    right-hand corner, and another, from the New York *Herald* of April 15, 1865,
    has a single-column story on the shooting of Lincoln. He blanketed another wall
    with lithographs and steel engravings. One depicts Garfield’s deathbed. Another
    is entitled “The Great Fight.” It was between Tom Hyer and Yankee Sullivan, both
    bare-knuckled, at Still Pond Heights, Maryland, in 1849\. It was won by Hyer in
    sixteen rounds, and the prize was $10,000\. The judges wore top hats. The brass
    title tag on another engraving reads, “Rescue of Colonel Thomas J. Kelly and Captain
    Timothy Deacy by Members of the Irish Revolutionary Brotherhood from the English
    Government at Manchester, England, September 18, 1867.” A copy of the Emancipation
    Proclamation is on this wall; so, almost inevitably, is a facsimile of Lincoln’s
    saloon licence. An engraving of Washington and his generals hangs next to an engraving
    of a session of the Great Parliament of Ireland. Eventually Old John covered practically
    every square inch of wall space between wainscot and ceiling with pictures and
    souvenirs. They are still in good condition, although spiders have strung webs
    across many of them. New customers get up on chairs and spend hours studying them.'

  zh: 老约翰对收藏品有着非同寻常的热情。多年来，他保存了感恩节和圣诞节火鸡的两端骨头，并把它们穿在连接吧台上方的一根杆上；这些灰尘飞扬的骨头总是新顾客首先感到好奇的东西。不久前，一位新来的顾客因为评论道：“也许老头子相信巫术。”这激怒了一个酒保。老约翰用宴会菜单、签名、海星壳、剧院节目单、政治海报以及从各种赛马和啤酒厂马蹄上摘下的破旧鞋子装饰了吧台和后室之间的隔断。在后室入口上方，他挂着一根小棍和一块标志：“*行善或离开*”。在酒吧的一面墙上，他放置了马匹、汽船、坦曼尼党头目、骑师、演员、歌手和遇刺的政治家的肖像；其中有许多优秀的林肯、加菲尔德和麦金利的画像。同一面墙上，他挂着旧报纸的封面画框；其中一张来自1815年6月22日伦敦《泰晤士报》，报道了滑铁卢战役的开端，位于右下角，另一张来自1865年4月15日纽约《先驱论坛报》，报道了林肯的枪击事件。他用石版画和钢版画覆盖了另一面墙。其中一幅描绘了加菲尔德的临终画面。另一幅题为“伟大的战斗”，发生在1849年马里兰州斯蒂尔池高地，汤姆·海尔和扬基·沙利文两人赤手空拳对战，由海尔在16回合中获胜，奖金为10000美元。裁判们戴着高顶礼帽。另一幅钢版画上的黄铜标签写着：“爱尔兰革命兄弟会成员于1867年9月18日从英国政府在曼彻斯特救出托马斯·J·凯利上校和蒂莫西·迪西。”墙上还挂着《解放宣言》的复印件；几乎不可避免地，还有林肯的酒吧执照的复制品。华盛顿及其将军的钢版画挂在一旁，旁边是爱尔兰大议会的会议钢版画。最终，老约翰几乎覆盖了每一英寸从镶木板到天花板的墙壁空间，挂满了图片和纪念品。它们仍然保存完好，尽管蜘蛛已经在许多地方结网。新顾客站在椅子上，花上几个小时研究它们。
- en: Although Old John did not consider himself retired until just a few years before
    he died, he gave up day-in-and-day-out duty back of the bar around 1890 and made
    his son, William, head bartender. Bill McSorley was the kind of person who minds
    his own business vigorously. He inherited every bit of his father’s surliness
    and not much of his affability. The father was by no means a lush, but the son
    carried temperance to an extreme; he drank nothing but tap water and tea, and
    bragged about it. He did dip a little snuff. He was so solemn that before he was
    thirty several customers had settled into the habit of calling him Old Bill. He
    worshipped his father, but no one was aware of the profundity of his worship until
    Old John died. After the funeral, Bill locked the saloon, went upstairs to the
    family flat, pulled the shutters to, and did not come out for almost a week. Finally,
    on a Sunday morning, gaunt and silent, he came downstairs with a hammer and a
    screwdriver and spent the day painstakingly securing his father’s pictures and
    souvenirs to the walls; they had been hung hit or miss on wires, and customers
    had a habit of taking them down. Subsequently he commissioned a Cooper Union art
    teacher to make a small painting of Old John from a photograph. Bill placed it
    on the wall back of the bar and thereafter kept a hooded electric light burning
    above it, a pious custom that is still observed.

  zh: 虽然老约翰自己不认为自己已经退休，直到他去世前的几年，他放弃了日复一日地在吧台后面工作，大约在1890年，把工作交给了他的儿子，威廉，成为首席调酒师。比尔·麦克索利是一个非常注意自己事务的人。他继承了他父亲所有的脾气，但并没有太多的和蔼可亲。他父亲绝不是一个酒鬼，但是他的儿子将戒酒推向了极端；他只喝自来水和茶，并为此而自豪。他会少量嗑一些烟草。他如此严肃，以至于在三十岁之前，几个顾客就已经习惯称他为老比尔。他崇拜他的父亲，但在老约翰去世之前，没有人意识到他的崇拜有多深刻。葬礼后，比尔锁上了酒吧，上楼到家庭公寓，拉上百叶窗，几乎一个星期没有出来。最后，在一个星期天早晨，消瘦而沉默的他拿着锤子和螺丝刀下楼，花了一天的时间仔细地把他父亲的照片和纪念品固定在墙上；它们曾经随意地挂在金属线上，顾客习惯了拿下来。随后，他委托了一位库珀联盟艺术老师根据一张照片制作了一幅小画像。比尔将其放在吧台后面的墙上，并在上面挂了一盏带罩的电灯，这是一种至今仍然遵守的虔诚习俗。
- en: 'Throughout his life Bill’s principal concern was to keep McSorley’s exactly
    as it had been in his father’s time. When anything had to be changed or repaired,
    it appeared to pain him physically. For twenty years the bar sagged in the middle
    like a plough mule’s back. A carpenter warned him repeatedly that it was about
    to collapse; finally, in 1933, he told the carpenter to go ahead and prop it up.
    While the work was in progress he sat at a table in the back room with his head
    in his hands and got so upset he could not eat for several days. In the same year
    the smoke- and cobweb-encrusted paint on the ceiling began to flake off and float
    to the floor. After customers complained that they were afraid the flakes they
    found in their ale might strangle them to death, he grudgingly had the ceiling
    repainted. In 1925 he had to switch to earthenware mugs; most of the pewter ones
    had been stolen by souvenir hunters. In the same year a coin-box telephone, which
    he would never answer himself, was installed in the back room. These were about
    the only major changes he ever allowed. Occasionally one of the pictures his father
    had hung would fall off the wall and the glass would break, and he would fill
    in the gap. His contributions include a set of portraits of the wives of Presidents
    through the first Mrs. Woodrow Wilson, a poster of Barney Oldfield in a red racing
    car, and a poem called “The Man Behind the Bar.” He knew this poem by heart and
    particularly liked the last verse:'

  zh: 虽然比尔一生中最重要的事情是保持麦克索利酒吧与他父亲时代完全一致。当有任何需要更改或修理的时候，这似乎会让他身心受到折磨。二十年来，酒吧中间一直下垂，像一头犁匹背部一样。一个木匠多次警告他说这快要倒塌了；最终，1933年，他告诉木匠去支撑它。在工作进行中，他坐在后房间的一张桌子旁，双手托着头，如此不安，几天都没吃东西。同一年，天花板上被烟雾和蛛网覆盖的油漆开始剥落并飘落到地板上。顾客抱怨说，他们担心在他们的啤酒中发现的小片会勒死他们，他不情愿地重新油漆了天花板。1925年，他不得不改用陶器马克杯；大部分的锡制杯子被纪念品猎人偷走了。同一年，一部投币电话被安装在后房间，他从不亲自接电话。这些几乎是他唯一允许的重大变化。偶尔，他父亲挂在墙上的照片中的一幅会掉下来，玻璃会碎，他会填补空白。他的贡献包括一套总统夫人的肖像画，一幅巴尼·奥尔德菲尔德穿着红色赛车的海报，以及一首名为“酒吧后面的人”的诗。他将这首诗背得滚瓜烂熟，并特别喜欢最后一节：

    and salesmen. If the saloon became crowded, he would close up early, saying, “I’m
    getting too confounded much trade in here.” Agents for the brewery from which
    he bought his ale often tried to get him to open a checking account; he stubbornly
    continued to pay his ale bills with currency, largely silver. He would count out
    the money four or five times and hand it to the driver in a paper bag. Bill was
    an able bartender. He understood ale; he knew how to draw it and how to keep it,
    and his bar pipes were always clean. In warm weather he made a practice of chilling
    the mugs in a tub of ice; even though a customer nursed an ale a long time, the
    chilled earthenware mug kept it cool. Except during prohibition, the rich, wax-colored
    ale sold in McSorley’s always has come from the Fidelio Brewery on First Avenue;
    the brewery was founded two years before the saloon. In 1934, Bill sold this brewery
    the right to call its ale McSorley’s Cream Stock and gave it permission to use
    Old John’s picture on the label; around the picture is the legend “As brewed for
    McSorley’s Old Ale House.” During prohibition McSorley’s ale was produced mysteriously
    in a row of washtubs in the cellar by a retired brewer named Barney Kelly, who
    would come down three times a week from his home in the Bronx. On these days the
    smell of malt and wet hops would be strong in the place. Kelly’s product was raw
    and extraordinarily emphatic, and Bill made a practice of weakening it with near
    beer. In fact, throughout prohibition Bill referred to his ale as near beer, a
    euphemism which greatly amused the customers. One night a policeman who knew Bill
    stuck his head in the door and said, “I seen a old man up at the corner wrestling
    with a truck horse. I asked him what he’d been drinking and he said, ‘Near beer
    in McSorley’s.’ ” The prohibition ale cost fifteen cents, or two mugs for a quarter.
    Ale now costs a dime a mug.

  zh: 作为一个商人，比尔显得有些过时；他讨厌银行、收银机、簿记和推销员。如果酒吧里变得拥挤，他会早早关门，说：“这里的生意太多了。”来自他购买啤酒的酿酒厂的代理商常常劝他开立支票账户；他执意用货币付啤酒账单，主要是银币。他会数数钱四五次，然后用纸袋把它交给司机。比尔是一位能干的调酒师。他懂得啤酒；他知道如何绘制它、如何保存它，他的酒管总是干净的。在暖和的天气里，他经常把酒杯放在冰桶里冷却；即使顾客慢慢喝着啤酒，冷却的陶土杯也能保持凉爽。除了禁酒时期，麦克索利的浓郁、蜡色的啤酒总是来自第一大道上的费德里奥酿酒厂；这家酿酒厂比酒吧早两年成立。1934年，比尔把这家酒厂卖给了麦克索利奶油酒的命名权，并允许使用老约翰的肖像作为标签上的图案；肖像周围写着“为麦克索利老酒馆酿造”。在禁酒时期，麦克索利的啤酒由一位退休酿酒师巴尼·凯利在地下室一排洗涤桶中神秘地制造；他每周从布朗克斯的家中下来三次。在这些日子里，麦克索利的地方弥漫着麦芽和湿啤酒花的浓烈气味。凯利的产品原始而极具表现力，比尔习惯用淡啤酒稀释它。事实上，在整个禁酒时期，比尔都称他的啤酒为淡啤酒，这个委婉语大大地逗乐了顾客们。一天晚上，认识比尔的警察探头探脑地说：“我在拐角处看见一个老人和一匹卡车马扭打。我问他喝了什么，他说‘在麦克索利的淡啤酒。’”禁酒时期的啤酒售价15美分，或者两杯卖25美分。现在，一杯啤酒只要一角钱。
- en: Bill was big and thick-shouldered, but he did not look strong; he had a shambling
    walk and a haggard face and always appeared to be convalescing from something.
    He wore rusty-black suits and black bow ties; his shirts, however, were surprisingly
    fancy—they were silk, with candy stripes. He was nearsighted, the saloon was always
    dimly lit, and his most rigid conviction was that drink should not be sold to
    minors; consequently he would sometimes peer across the bar at a small-sized adult
    and say, “Won’t sell you nothing, bud. Get along home, where you belong.” Once
    he stared for a long time at a corner of the saloon and suddenly shouted, “Take
    your foot off that table!” Evidently he had been staring at a shadow; no one was
    sitting in the corner. Bill was tyrannical. Reading a newspaper, he would completely
    disregard a line of customers waiting to be served. If a man became impatient
    and demanded a drink, Bill would look up angrily and shout obscene remarks at
    him in a high, nasal voice. Such treatment did not annoy customers but made them
    snicker; they thought he was funny. In fact, despite Bill’s bad disposition, many
    customers were fond of him. They had known him since they were young men together
    and had grown accustomed to his quirks. They even took a wry sort of pride in
    him, and when they said he was the gloomiest, or the stingiest, man in the Western
    Hemisphere there was boastfulness in their voices; the more eccentric he became,
    the more they respected him. Sometimes, for the benefit of a newcomer, one of
    these customers would show Bill off, shouting, “Hey, Bill, lend me fifty dollars!”
    or “Hey, Bill, there ain’t no pockets in a shroud!” Such remarks usually provoked
    an outburst of gamy epithets. Then the customer would turn proudly to the newcomer
    and say, “See?” When prohibition came, Bill simply disregarded it. He ran wide
    open. He did not have a peephole door, nor did he pay protection, but McSorley’s
    was never raided; the fact that it was patronized by a number of Tammany politicians
    and minor police officials probably gave it immunity.

  zh: 比尔身材高大，肩膀宽阔，但看起来并不强壮；他走路跌跌撞撞，面容憔悴，总像是在从某种病中康复。他穿着锈迹斑斑的黑西装和黑色领结；然而，他的衬衫却出奇地花哨——是丝绸的，带有糖果条纹。他近视，酒吧总是昏暗的，他最坚定的信念是未成年人不应该喝酒；因此，有时他会斜眼看着吧台对面的一个个小个子成年人，说：“少爷，不卖给你。快回家，回你的地方去。”有一次他长时间地盯着酒吧角落，突然大喊：“把脚从桌子上拿开！”显然他是在盯着一个影子；那个角落里没有人坐着。比尔是暴君。他读报时完全不理会排队等候的顾客。如果有人不耐烦地要求饮料，比尔会生气地抬头高声对他喊粗话，鼻音嘶哑。这样的对待并没有惹恼顾客，反而让他们窃笑；他们觉得他很滑稽。事实上，尽管比尔脾气不好，许多顾客却很喜欢他。他们从年轻时就认识他，并且习惯了他的怪癖。他们甚至有点自豪，当他们说他是西半球最阴沉或最吝啬的人时，他们的语气中带有夸耀；他越是古怪，他们就越尊重他。有时，为了向一个新来者炫耀，其中一位顾客会喊道：“嘿，比尔，借我五十块！”或者“嘿，比尔，裹尸布里没有口袋！”这样的话通常会引起一阵不雅的话语爆发。然后顾客会自豪地转向新来者说：“看见了吧？”禁酒令出台时，比尔干脆置之不理。他放开了手脚。他的门上没有窥视孔，也没有付保护费，但麦克索利酒吧从未被突袭过；这里的顾客包括一些坐在泰门尼政客和较低级别的警察官员，这可能给了它免受突袭的豁免权。
- en: Bill never had a fixed closing hour but locked up as soon as he began to feel
    sleepy, which was usually around ten o’clock. Just before closing he would summon
    everybody to the bar and buy a round. This had been his father’s custom and he
    faithfully carried it on, even though it seemed to hurt him to do so. If the customers
    were slow about finishing the final drink, he would cough fretfully once or twice,
    then drum on the bar with both fists and say, “Now, see here, gents! I’m under
    no obligoddamnation to stand here all night while you baby them drinks.” Whenever
    Bill completely lost his temper he would jump up and down and moan piteously.
    One night in the winter of 1924 a feminist from Greenwich Village put on trousers,
    a man’s topcoat, and a cap, stuck a cigar in her mouth, and entered McSorley’s.
    She bought an ale, drank it, removed her cap, and shook her long hair down on
    her shoulders. Then she called Bill a male chauvinist, yelled something about
    the equality of the sexes, and ran out. When Bill realized he had sold a drink
    to a woman, he let out a cross between a moan and a bellow and began to jump up
    and down as if his heels were on fire. “She was a woman!” he yelled. “She was
    a goddamn woman!”

  zh: 比尔从来没有固定的关门时间，但只要开始感到困倦，他就会关门，这通常发生在晚上十点左右。在关门前一刻，他会召唤所有人到吧台前，再请客人们喝一圈酒。这是他父亲的习惯，他一直忠实地遵循了下来，尽管这似乎会伤害到他。如果顾客们在喝完最后一杯酒时磨蹭不走，他会焦虑地咳嗽一两声，然后用双拳敲击吧台，说，“现在，看这儿，伙计们！我没有义务在这里一直站着，看着你们一杯接一杯地抱着酒。”每当比尔完全失去了耐心，他会跳起来，然后可怜巴巴地哼哼。1924年冬天的一个晚上，来自格林尼治村的一位女权主义者穿上了一条裤子，一件男人的大衣和一顶帽子，嘴里叼着一根雪茄，走进了麦克索利。她买了一杯啤酒，喝完后摘下帽子，摊下长发。
    然后她称比尔为男权主义者，大喊着关于两性平等的事，最后跑了出去。当比尔意识到他竟然给一个女人卖酒时，他发出了沮丧和怒吼的交织声，开始像脚后跟着火一样跳起来。“她是个女人！”他大喊道。“她是个该死的女人！”
- en: Bill was deaf, or pretended to be; even so, ordinary noises seemed to bother
    him unduly. The method he devised to keep the saloon tranquil was characteristic
    of him. He bought a fire-alarm gong similar to those used in schools and factories
    and screwed it to the seven-foot-tall icebox behind the bar. If someone started
    a song, or if the old men sitting around the stove began to yell at each other,
    he would shuffle over to the gong and give the rope a series of savage jerks.
    The gong is there yet and is customarily sounded at a quarter to midnight as a
    warning that closing time is imminent; the customers grab their ears when it goes
    off. Bill was consistent in his aversion to noise; he didn’t even like the sound
    of his own voice. He was able to go for days without speaking, answering all questions
    with a snort or a grunt. A man who drank in McSorley’s steadily for sixteen years
    once said that in that time Bill spoke exactly four intelligible words to him.
    They were “Curiosity killed the cat.” The man had politely asked Bill to tell
    him the history of a pair of rusty convict shackles on the wall. He learned later
    that a customer who had fought in the Civil War had brought them back from a Confederate
    prison in Andersonville, Georgia, and had given them to Old John as a souvenir.

  zh: 比尔是个聋子，或者是假装的；但是，即便如此，普通的噪音似乎也让他过于烦扰。他设计用来保持酒吧安宁的方法充分展现了他的特点。他买了一个类似于学校和工厂使用的火警警铃，并将其螺丝紧固在吧台后面七英尺高的冰箱上。如果有人唱歌，或者老人围着火炉吵架，他就会蹒跚地走到警铃旁边，狠狠地拉绳子。现在那个警铃还在那儿，每到午夜时刻，它都会按规矩响几下，作为关闭时间即将到来的警告；当警铃响时，顾客们都揪着耳朵。比尔讨厌噪音从来就是一贯的；他甚至不喜欢自己的声音。他能连续数天不讲话，只用哼哼或咕噜回答所有问题。一位在麦克索利酒吧里喝酒连续十六年的人声称，在那段时间里，比尔只对他说了四个能听懂的词。他说的是“好奇害死猫”。那个男人曾礼貌地询问比尔给他讲讲墙上一对生了锈的囚徒手铐的历史。他后来得知，一位参加内战的顾客把他们从佐治亚州安德森维尔的联邦监狱带回来，并把它们送给了老约翰作为纪念品。
- en: Bill would sometimes take an inexplicable liking to a customer. Around 1911
    a number of painters began hanging out in McSorley’s. Among them were John Sloan,
    George Luks, Glenn O. Coleman, and Stuart Davis, the abstractionist. They were
    all good painters, they did not put on airs, and the workingmen in the saloon
    accepted them as equals. One night, Hippolyte Havel, the anarchist, came in with
    the painters. Havel was a long-haired, myopic, gentle-mannered Czech whose speeches
    often got him in trouble with the police. Even Bill was curious about him. “What’s
    that crazy-looking feller do for a living?” he asked one of the painters. Playing
    safe, the painter said Havel was a politician, more or less. Havel liked the place
    and became a steady customer. Most nights, after making a fiery speech in Union
    Square, he would hurry down to McSorley’s. To the amazement of the old-timers,
    a strong friendship grew up between him and Bill, who was a Tammany Democrat and
    an utter reactionary; no one was ever able to figure out the basis of the friendship.
    Bill called the anarchist Hippo and would let him have credit up to two dollars;
    other customers were not allowed to charge so much as a nickel cigar. Bill had
    an extremely vague idea about Havel’s politics. Charles Francis Murphy, the Tammany
    boss, occasionally dropped in, and once Bill told Havel he was going to speak
    a good word to the boss for him. “Maybe he’ll put you in line for something,”
    Bill said. The anarchist, who thought no man was as foul as a Tammany boss, smiled
    and thanked him. A police captain once took it upon himself to warn Bill against
    Havel. “You better keep your eyes on that long-haired nut,” he said. “Why?” asked
    Bill. The question annoyed the police captain. “Hell fire, man,” he said, “Havel’s
    an anarchist! He’s in favor of blowing up every bank in the country.” “So am I,”
    said Bill. Bill’s friendship for Havel was extraordinary in every way. As a rule,
    he reserved his kindness for cats. He owned as many as eighteen at once and they
    had the run of the saloon. He fed them on bull livers put through a sausage grinder
    and they became enormous. When it came time to feed them, he would leave the bar,
    no matter how brisk business was, and bang on the bottom of a tin pan; the fat
    cats would come loping up, like leopards, from all corners of the saloon.

  zh: 比尔有时会莫名其妙地喜欢上一个顾客。大约在1911年，一些画家开始常去麦克索利酒吧。他们中有约翰·斯隆（John Sloan）、乔治·卢克斯（George
    Luks）、格伦·O·科尔曼（Glenn O. Coleman）和斯图尔特·戴维斯（Stuart Davis），这位抽象主义者。他们都是优秀的画家，不摆架子，酒吧里的工人把他们当作平等的朋友。有一天晚上，无政府主义者希波来到了酒吧，他和这些画家一起来。希波是一个长发、近视、温文尔雅的捷克人，他的演讲经常让他与警察惹上麻烦。连比尔也对他感到好奇。“那个看起来疯狂的家伙靠什么谋生？”他问画家中的一个人。为了安全起见，画家说希波是一个或多或少的政治家。希波喜欢这个地方，并成为了常客。大多数晚上，在联合广场上发表激情澎湃的演讲后，他会匆匆赶到麦克索利酒吧。令老酒鬼们惊讶的是，他与比尔之间建立了深厚的友谊。比尔是塔曼尼民主党人，也是个彻底的保守派；谁也没有能弄清这段友谊的基础。比尔称这位无政府主义者为希波，允许他赊账最多两美元；其他顾客则不能赊账一根五分钱的雪茄。比尔对希波的政治观念模糊不清。查尔斯·弗朗西斯·墨菲，塔曼尼政党的老板，偶尔也会光顾酒吧，有一次比尔告诉希波他打算向老板好好说几句话。“也许他会给你安排些事情。”比尔说。这位无政府主义者认为没有比塔曼尼老板更卑鄙的人，笑着向他道谢。有一次，一位警察队长主动警告比尔注意希波。“你最好留意那个长发疯子。”他说。“为什么？”比尔问道。这个问题激怒了警察队长。“该死，伙计。”他说，“希波是个无政府主义者！他支持炸毁全国所有的银行。”“我也是。”比尔说。比尔对希波的友谊在各个方面都是非同寻常的。通常情况下，他只对猫咪们表现出这样的仁慈。他一度同时拥有多达十八只猫，它们在酒吧里随处逛。他用绞肉机加工的牛肝喂养它们，它们变得又大又肥。每到喂食时间，无论生意多忙，他都会离开吧台，敲击锡盘底部；那些肥猫们会从酒吧各个角落蹦蹦跳跳地赶过来，像豹子一样。
- en: Bill had been married but was childless, and he used to say, “When I go, this
    place goes with me.” In March, 1936, however, he changed his mind— why, no one
    knows—and, to the surprise of the veteran customers, sold both saloon and tenement
    to Daniel O’Connell, an old policeman, who, since 1900, had spent most of his
    leisure at a table in the back room. O’Connell retired from the Department two
    days before he purchased the saloon. He was the kind of man of whom people say,
    “If he can’t speak a good word about you, he won’t speak a bad one.” He was almost
    as proud of the saloon’s traditions as Bill and willingly promised he would make
    no changes; that was one of the conditions of the sale. Almost from the day Bill
    sold out, his health began to fail. He took a room in the house of a relative
    in Queens. Sometimes, in the afternoon, if the weather was good, he would shuffle
    into the bar, a sallow, disenchanted old man, and sit in the Peter Cooper chair
    with his knotty hands limp in his lap. For hours he would sit and stare at the
    painting of Old John. The customers were sure he was getting ready to die, but
    when he came in they would say, “You looking chipper today, Billy boy,” or something
    like that. He seemed grateful for such remarks. He rarely spoke, but once he turned
    to a man he had known for forty years and said, “Times have changed, McNally.”
    “You said it, Bill,” McNally replied. Then, as if afraid he had been sentimental,
    Bill coughed, spat, and said, irrelevantly, “The bread you get these days, it
    ain’t fit to feed a dog.” On the night of September 21, 1938, barely thirty-one
    months after he quit drawing ale, he died in his sleep. As close as his friends
    could figure it, his age was seventy-six.

  zh: 比尔已经结过婚，但没有孩子，他过去常说，“我走了，这地方也随我走。”然而，1936年3月，他改变了主意——为什么，没有人知道——让老顾客大吃一惊的是，把酒吧和公寓都卖给了丹尼尔·奥康奈尔，一个老警察，自1900年以来大部分业余时间都在后厅的一张桌子旁度过。奥康奈尔在买下酒吧的两天前退休了。他是那种人，人们会说，“如果他不能对你说好话，他也不会说坏话。”他几乎和比尔一样为酒吧的传统感到自豪，并乐意承诺不会有任何改变；这是交易的条件之一。几乎从比尔卖出那天起，他的健康就开始恶化。他在皇后区的一个亲戚家里租了一个房间。有时候下午天气好的时候，他会蹒跚地走进酒吧，一个苍白、失望的老人，坐在彼得·库珀的椅子上，他的粗糙手在膝盖上无力地放着。他会坐上几个小时，凝视着老约翰的画像。顾客们确信他在准备死去，但每次他进来他们会说，“比利老兄，你今天看起来挺精神的”，或类似的话。他似乎对这样的话很感激。他很少说话，但有一次他转向一个他认识了四十年的人说，“时代变了，麦克纳利。”“你说对了，比尔，”麦克纳利回答说。然后，好像害怕自己感情用事一样，比尔咳嗽了一下，吐了口唾沫，无关紧要地说，“这些天得到的面包，没法喂狗。”1938年9月21日晚上，在他停止倒啤酒仅仅31个月之后，他安详地去世了。根据他的朋友们估算，他大约七十六岁。
- en: The retired policeman made a gentle saloonkeeper. Unlike Bill, he would never
    throw a quarrelsome drunk into the street but would try to sober him up with soup.
    “If a man gets crazy on stuff I sold him, I can’t kick him out,” he said one day.
    “That would be evading my responsibility.” He was proprietor for less than four
    years. He died last December 8th and left the property to a daughter, Mrs. Dorothy
    O’Connell Kirwan. A young woman with great respect for tradition, Mrs. Kirwan
    has chosen to remain completely in the background. At first customers feared that
    she would renovate the place, but they now realize that this fear was groundless.
    “I know exactly how my father felt about McSorley’s,” Mrs. Kirwan said recently,
    “and no changes will be made. So long as I am owner, the rule against women customers
    will remain in force.” She herself has visited the saloon only twice, and then
    on Sunday nights after hours. She appointed a brother-in-law, Joe Nida, manager
    and retained the old bartenders, Eddie Mullins and Joe Martoccio. Mike, the cook,
    a Ukrainian, was also retained. The most important member of the staff of McSorley’s,
    however, is not actually an employee. His name is Tommy Kelly, and he is called
    Kelly the Floorwalker. He is not related to Barney Kelly, the prohibition brewer.
    Since around 1904, Kelly has acted as a sort of volunteer potboy and master of
    ceremonies. During prohibition, Bill had him on the payroll, but most of the time
    he has worked for the pleasure of it. When business is brisk, he totes mugs from
    the bar to the tables; also, he makes an occasional trip to the butcher for Mike.
    In the winter he keeps a fire going. When he shows up, around 8:30 A.M., he is
    just an average, sad-eyed little man with a hangover, but by noon lukewarm ale
    has given him a certain stateliness; by six he is in such a good humor that he
    stands near the door and shakes hands with incoming customers just as if he were
    the proprietor. Strangers think he is the proprietor and call him Mr. McSorley.
    Technically, Kelly is a truck-driver, but he always says business is slow in his
    line. Once, for a brief period, he took a job as night clerk in a funeral parlor
    in Brooklyn, quitting because a corpse spoke to him. “This dead guy told me to
    take my hat off indoors,” Kelly says. In one way or another, death pops up repeatedly
    in Kelly’s talk. Each morning, Mullins, the bartender, asks him how he feels.
    If he doesn’t feel so good, he says, “I’m dead, but I just won’t lie still.” Otherwise
    he says, “For a old drunk with one leg in the grave and not a penny to his name,
    I can’t complain.”

- en: To a steady McSorley customer, most other New York saloons seem feminine and
    fit only for college boys and women; the atmosphere in them is so tense and disquieting
    that he has to drink himself into a coma in order to stand it. In McSorley’s,
    the customers are self-sufficient; they never try to impress each other. Also,
    they are not competitive. In other saloons if a man tells a story, good or bad,
    the man next to him laughs perfunctorily and immediately tries to tell a better
    one. It is possible to relax in McSorley’s. For one thing, it is dark and gloomy,
    and repose comes easy in a gloomy place. Also, there is a thick, musty smell that
    acts as a balm to jerky nerves; it is really a rich compound of the smells of
    pine sawdust, tap drippings, pipe tobacco, coal smoke, and onions. A Bellevue
    interne once said that for many mental disturbances the smell in McSorley’s is
    more beneficial than psychoanalysis. It is an utterly democratic place. A mechanic
    in greasy overalls gets as much attention as an executive from Wanamaker’s. The
    only customer the bartenders brag about is Police Inspector Matthew J. McGrath,
    who was a shot-and hammer-thrower in four Olympics and is called Mighty Matt.

- en: At midday, McSorley’s is crowded. The afternoon is quiet. At six, it fills up
    with men who work in the neighborhood. Most nights there are a few curiosity-seekers
    in the place. If they behave themselves and don’t ask too many questions, they
    are tolerated. The majority of them have learned about the saloon through John
    Sloan’s paintings. Between 1912 and 1930, Sloan did five paintings, filled with
    detail, of the saloon—“McSorley’s Bar,” which shows Bill presiding majestically
    over the tap and which hangs in the Detroit Institute of Arts; “McSorley’s Back
    Room,” a painting of an old workingman sitting at the window at dusk with his
    hands in his lap, his pewter mug on the table; “McSorley’s at Home,” which shows
    a group of argumentative old-timers around the stove; “McSorley’s Cats,” in which
    Bill is preparing to feed his drove of cats; and “McSorley’s, Saturday Night,”
    which was painted during prohibition and shows Bill passing out mugs to a crowd
    of rollicking customers. Every time one of these appears in an exhibition or in
    a newspaper or magazine, there is a rush of strangers to the saloon. “McSorley’s
    Bar” was reproduced in Thomas Craven’s “A Treasury of Art Masterpieces,” which
    came out last winter, and there have been many strangers in the saloon since.
    Last November there was a retrospective exhibition of Sloan’s work in Wanamaker’s
    art department, and a number of McSorley patrons attended it in a body. One asked
    a clerk for the price of “McSorley’s Cats.” “Three thousand dollars,” he was told.
    He believed the clerk was kidding him and is still indignant. Kelly likes the
    Sloan paintings but prefers a golden, corpulent nude which Old John hung in the
    back room many years ago, right beside Peter Cooper’s portrait. To a stranger,
    attracted to the saloon by a Sloan painting, Kelly will say, “Hey, Mac, if you
    want to see some real art, go look at the naked lady in the back room.” The nude
    is stretched out on a couch and is playing with a parrot; the painting is a copy,
    probably done by a Cooper Union student, of Gustave Courbet’s “La Femme au Perroquet.”
    Kelly always translates this for strangers. “It’s French,” he says learnedly.
    “It means ‘Duh Goil and duh Polly.’ ”

  zh: 中午时分，麦克索利的酒吧总是挤满了人。下午则显得比较宁静。六点钟，会聚集起附近工作的男士们。大多数晚上会有一些好奇者光顾此地。只要他们行为得体，不问太多问题，就会被容忍。他们大多数是通过约翰·斯隆的画作了解到这家酒吧的。斯隆在1912年至1930年间创作了五幅画作，细节丰富，描绘了这家酒吧——《麦克索利的酒吧》展示了比尔在酒龛前庄严的场景，作品现藏于底特律艺术博物馆；《麦克索利的后厅》描绘了一个老工人黄昏时分坐在窗前，双手搁在膝盖上，锡器酒杯放在桌上；《麦克索利的家中》展示了一群好斗的老人围绕着火炉；《麦克索利的猫》中，比尔正在准备喂养他的一群猫；《麦克索利，星期六晚上》是在禁酒时期创作的，展示了比尔在向一群欢闹的客人敬酒。每当这些画作在展览会、报纸或杂志中出现时，酒吧就会涌现出大量陌生人。《麦克索利的酒吧》曾出现在托马斯·克雷文的《艺术杰作宝库》中，去年冬天出版，自那时以来，酒吧里就有了许多陌生人。去年十一月，在华纳梅克百货艺术部举办了斯隆作品回顾展，许多麦克索利的常客也一同参加了展览。有人向一位店员询问《麦克索利的猫》的价格。店员告诉他：“三千美元。”他认为店员在开玩笑，至今仍感到愤怒。凯利喜欢斯隆的画作，但更喜欢老约翰多年前挂在后厅的一幅金色丰腴的裸体画，正好挨着彼得·库珀的肖像。对于因斯隆画作而来到酒吧的陌生人，凯利会说：“嘿，伙计，如果你想看看真正的艺术，去后厅看看那幅裸女画吧。”裸体女人躺在长椅上，正在和一只鹦鹉玩耍；这幅画很可能是库珀联盟学生的复制品，原作是古斯塔夫·库尔贝的《鹦鹉女》。对于陌生人，凯利总是帮忙翻译这幅画。他学着说：“这是法语，意思是‘那个女孩和那只鹦鹉’。”
- en: McSorley’s bar is short, accommodating approximately ten elbows, and is shored
    up with iron pipes. It is to the right as you enter. To the left is a row of armchairs
    with their stiff backs against the wainscoting. The chairs are rickety; when a
    fat man is sitting in one, it squeaks like new shoes every time he takes a breath.
    The customers believe in sitting down; if there are vacant chairs, no one ever
    stands at the bar. Down the middle of the room is a row of battered tables. Their
    tops are always sticky with spilled ale. In the centre of the room stands the
    belly stove, which has an isinglass door and is exactly like the stoves in Elevated
    stations. All winter Kelly keeps it red hot. “Warmer you get, drunker you get,”
    he says. Some customers prefer mulled ale. They keep their mugs on the hob until
    the ale gets hot as coffee. A sluggish cat named Minnie sleeps in a scuttle beside
    the stove. The floor boards are warped, and here and there a hole has been patched
    with a flattened-out soup can. The back room looks out on a blind tenement court.
    In this room are three big, round dining-room tables. The kitchen is in one corner
    of the room; Mike keeps a folding boudoir screen around the gas range, and pots,
    pans, and paper bags of groceries are stored on the mantelpiece. While he peels
    potatoes, he sits with early customers at a table out front, holding a dishpan
    in his lap and talking as he peels. The fare in McSorley’s is plain, cheap, and
    well cooked. Mike’s specialties are goulash, frankfurters and sauerkraut, and
    hamburgers blanketed with fried onions. He scribbles his menu in chalk on a slate
    which hangs in the barroom and consistently misspells four dishes out of five.
    There is no waiter. During the lunch hour, if Mike is too busy to wait on the
    customers, they grab plates and help themselves out of the pots on the range.
    They eat with their hats on and they use toothpicks. Mike refers to food as “she.”
    For example, if a customer complains that the goulash is not as good as it was
    last Wednesday, he says, “No matter how not as good she is, she’s good enough
    for you.”

  zh: McSorley's 酒吧很小，大约只能容纳十个肘部，用铁管支撑着。你进门后向右走，左边是一排扶手椅，它们的硬背靠着镶木板。椅子摇摇晃晃的；当一个胖子坐在上面时，每次他呼吸时都像新鞋子一样吱吱作响。顾客们喜欢坐着；如果有空椅子，从不会有人站在吧台前。房间中央是一排破旧的桌子。它们的桌面总是被洒满了倒出的麦酒，粘粘的。房间中央是一个肚子形的火炉，它有一个明胶门，和高架车站里的炉子一模一样。整个冬天，凯利都让它红红的烧着。“你越暖，你越醉，”他说。一些顾客喜欢热葡萄酒。他们把酒杯放在火炉上，直到麦酒变得像咖啡一样热。一只懒洋洋的叫米妮的猫在火炉旁的一个桶里睡觉。地板板砖翘曲，那里修补了一些地方，用压扁的罐头盒补丁。后面的房间面向一个盲人公寓庭院。房间里有三张大圆餐桌。厨房位于房间的一角；迈克在煤气灶周围放了一个可折叠的屏风，锅碗瓢盆和纸袋杂货都放在壁炉架上。当他削土豆时，他坐在前面的桌子上和早来的顾客聊天，把一个餐盘放在膝盖上。McSorley's
    的饭菜简单、便宜且做得好。迈克的特色菜包括匈牙利炖牛肉、法兰克福香肠和酸菜，以及覆盖着炒洋葱的汉堡。他在酒吧里的黑板上用粉笔涂写菜单，五道菜中有四道他总是拼错。这里没有服务员。午餐时间，如果迈克太忙没法招待顾客，他们就自己拿盘子从炉子上的锅里取菜。他们戴着帽子吃饭，用牙签。迈克把食物称为“她”。例如，如果顾客抱怨说炖牛肉不如上周三的好，他会说，“无论她有多不好，她对你来说足够好了。”
- en: The saloon opens at eight. Mike gives the floor a lick and a promise and throws
    on clean sawdust. He replenishes the free-lunch platters with cheese and onions
    and fills a bowl with cold, hard-boiled eggs, five cents each. Kelly shows up.
    The ale truck makes its delivery. Then, in the middle of the morning, the old
    men begin shuffling in. Kelly calls them “the steadies.” The majority are retired
    laborers and small businessmen. They prefer McSorley’s to their homes. A few live
    in the neighborhood, but many come from a distance. One, a retired operator of
    a chain of Bowery flophouses, comes in from Sheepshead Bay practically every day.
    On the day of his retirement, this man said, “If my savings hold out, I’ll never
    draw another sober breath.” He says he drinks in order to forget the misery he
    saw in his flophouses; he undoubtedly saw a lot of it, because he often drinks
    twenty-five mugs a day, and McSorley’s ale is by no means weak. Kelly brings the
    old men their drinks. To save him a trip, they usually order two mugs at a time.
    Most of them are quiet and dignified; a few are eccentrics. About twelve years
    ago one had to leap out of the path of a speeding automobile on Third Avenue;
    he is still furious. He mutters to himself constantly. Once, asked what he was
    muttering about, he said, “Going to buy a shotgun and stand on Third Avenue and
    shoot at automobiles.” “Are you going to aim at the tires?” he was asked. “Why,
    hell no!” he said. “At the drivers. Figure I could kill four or five before they
    arrested me. Might kill more if I could reload fast enough.”

  zh: 早晨八点，酒馆开门。迈克打扫地面，重新铺上干净的锯末。他在免费午餐的盘子里加了奶酪和洋葱，还准备了一碗冷硬煮鸡蛋，每个五分钱。凯利到了。啤酒卡车送货上门。接着，上午中段，老人们开始陆续进来。凯利称他们为“常客”。大部分是退休的劳工和小商人。他们更喜欢麦克索利的酒吧而不是自己的家。少数住在附近，但很多人从远处赶来。其中一位曾经经营过波利街上的一系列廉价旅馆，退休后几乎每天从谢普斯黑德湾赶来。退休那天，这位老人说：“如果我能省下一些积蓄，我就再也不会呼吸清醒的空气了。”他说他喝酒是为了忘记在旅馆里看到的痛苦；毫无疑问，他见过很多，因为他经常一天喝二十五杯，而麦克索利的啤酒绝不是弱者。凯利为老人们端来酒水。为了省他一次行程，他们通常会一次点两杯。他们大多数人都很安静和庄重；少数人很古怪。大约十二年前，有人不得不跳出第三大道上一辆飞驰而过的汽车的路线；他至今仍然愤怒。他经常自言自语。有人问他在嘟囔什么，他说：“我要买支猎枪，站在第三大道上，向汽车开枪。”“你打算瞄准轮胎吗？”他被问道。“哦，肯定不！”他说。“瞄准司机。我想我可以在被捕之前杀死四五个。如果我能够快速换弹，可能会杀更多。”
- en: Only a few of the old men have enough interest in the present to read newspapers.
    These patrons sit up front, to get the light that comes through the grimy street
    windows. When they grow tired of reading, they stare for hours into the street.
    There is always something worth looking at on Seventh Street. It is one of those
    East Side streets completely under the domination of kids. While playing stickball,
    they keep great packing-box fires going in the gutter; sometimes they roast mickies
    in the gutter fires. Drunks reel over from the Bowery and go to sleep in doorways,
    and the kids give them hotfoots with kitchen matches. In McSorley’s the free-lunch
    platters are kept at the end of the bar nearer the street door, and several times
    every afternoon kids sidle in, snatch handfuls of cheese and slices of onion,
    and dash out, slamming the door. This never fails to amuse the old men.

  zh: 只有少数几个老人对现在感兴趣到阅读报纸。这些顾客坐在前排，以便获得透过污秽街道窗户射进来的光线。当他们厌倦阅读时，他们会盯着街道凝视数小时。第七街上总是有值得看的东西。它是东区那些完全被孩子们支配的街道之一。他们边玩棍球边在水沟里燃起大箱子的火；有时候他们在水沟里的火里烤“米基”。醉鬼从鲍尔街晃晃悠悠地走来，在门口睡着了，孩子们用厨房火柴给他们点燃了“热脚”。在麦克索利的酒吧，免费午餐的盘子放在靠近街门的吧台尽头，每天下午几次，孩子们偷偷溜进来，抓起一把奶酪和洋葱片，然后冲出去，砰地一声关上门。这总是逗乐老人们。
- en: The stove overheats the place and some of the old men are able to sleep in their
    chairs for long periods. Occasionally one will snore, and Kelly will rouse him,
    saying, “You making enough racket to wake the dead.” Once Kelly got interested
    in a sleeper and clocked him. Two hours and forty minutes after the man dozed
    off, Kelly became uneasy—“Maybe he died,” he said—and shook him awake. “How long
    did I sleep?” the man asked. “Since the parade,” Kelly said. The man rubbed his
    eyes and asked, “Which parade?” “The Paddy’s Day parade, two years ago,” Kelly
    said scornfully. “Jeez!” the man said. Then he yawned and went back to sleep.
    Kelly makes jokes about the regularity of the old men. “Hey, Eddie,” he said one
    morning, “old man Ryan must be dead!” “Why?” Mullins asked. “Well,” Kelly said,
    “he ain’t been in all week.” In summer they sit in the back room, which is as
    cool as a cellar. In winter they grab the chairs nearest the stove and sit in
    them, as motionless as barnacles, until around six, when they yawn, stretch, and
    start for home, insulated with ale against the dreadful loneliness of the old.
    “God be wit’ yez,” Kelly says as they go out the door. ♦

  zh: 炉子把屋子热得像蒸笼，有些老人能够在椅子上长时间地打盹。偶尔会有人打呼噜，凯利会把他吵醒，说：“你吵得够死人了。”有一次，凯利对一个睡着的人很感兴趣，就盯着他。这个人入睡后两小时四十分钟，凯利开始不安：“也许他挂了，”他说着，把他摇醒。“我睡了多久？”那人问。“从游行开始。”凯利不屑地说。“哪个游行？”那人揉揉眼睛问。“圣帕特里克节游行，两年前。”凯利嘲讽地说。“天啊！”那人说着，又打起哈欠，继续睡去了。凯利常常拿老人们的规律开玩笑。“嘿，埃迪，”他一天早晨说，“老瑞安可能死了！”“为什么？”穆林斯问。“嗯，”凯利说，“整个星期都没见他。”夏天他们坐在后屋，那里凉如地窖。冬天他们抓住离炉子最近的椅子坐在上面，像海藤一样一动不动，直到六点左右，他们打了个哈欠，伸了个懒腰，开始往家走，饮了些啤酒，以对抗老年孤独的可怕。他们走出门时，凯利说：“上帝与你们同在。”
