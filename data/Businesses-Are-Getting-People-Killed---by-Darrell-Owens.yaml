    large, car-oriented commercial corridor and severed the man’s leg. That man, for
    no good reason, will suffer a potentially life-de-stabilizing disability for the
    duration of his life. The consequence for the driver will be nothing. The street
    won't be any safer in the near future as well, because years ago some business
    owners and a pro-car council member killed a bike lane proposal for the corridor.

- en: A month ago, a reckless, impatient driver in San Francisco lost control and
    rammed into a mother, father, and their two babies waiting at a bus stop — killing
    the entire family. In August last year, another driver coming too fast off a freeway
    off-ramp struck a family and killed their baby. This week it was announced that
    the driver will suffer no consequences, other than symbolic community service
    and taking a “driver safety class.” Criminal courts will likely impose a similarly
    weak consequence to the driver that wiped out the family last month.

    evidence suggests their reckless impatience killed people. Certainly, that will
    haunt her for the rest of her life. Jail time should be reserved for drivers who

    traffic engineers and city planners who let drivers speed through crowded pedestrian

    on people responsibly using this privilege. A responsible society would've barred
    this person from driving ever again in a dense, transit-rich, populated area like
    San Francisco at the very least. Yet our justice system treats cars as equally
    essential to people's mobility as oxygen is to the brain, yet with none of the
    caution and responsibility expected of a car's use. The easiest way to get away
    with murder in the United States is to kill someone with your car and make it

    will never suffer any consequence for their actions. Every day, families are torn
    apart by cars killing people. Those who survive blows from cars are instantly
    disabled and disfigured, lose their jobs and livelihoods, and suffer from severe

    “Vision Zero”, a plan to eliminate traffic deaths, inspired by the Netherlands’s
    success in creating a traffic-death-free haven. These reforms have failed everywhere
    in the United States because Americans are politically unwilling to make the changes
    necessary to make alternatives to driving safer. No large or even medium-sized
    city can boast zero traffic deaths and nationwide traffic deaths have stubbornly
    increased since 2010.

    regulatory loopholes allowing oversized trucks that can’t see in front of them,

    initiated traffic safety reforms that reduced driving to widespread opposition
    by motorists and merchants. But the mayor persisted and transformed Paris into
    a walking, cycling, and transit haven. Paris''s transformation is broadly popular

- en: The number one obstacle to any safety improvements is local merchants and commerce
    interests, unfortunately. Business owners and the merchant class believe that
    any customers they get are drivers. They are unswayed by research consistently
    showing that increased foot traffic and alternative travel to commercial areas
    increase their profit. Part of this is because merchants are just as car-brained
    as the general population. But the other half is that merchants disproportionately
    listen to their patrons who drive and complain about parking. Transit riders,
    cyclists and pedestrians don’t advertise to merchants that they didn't arrive
    by car.

- en: Though small in number, the elected interests of most local cities give disproportionate
    attention to business interests and their pro-driving beliefs. Even in progressive
    Berkeley, home of many climate scientists from the university, transportation
    decisions are dictated by science illiterates and business interests, not the
    city’s intellectuals. When Berkeley proposed building a bike lane in my neighborhood,
    which has no protected bike lanes near a prominent middle school, many wise locals
    went uncharacteristically nuts. Plastered on neighborhood businesses were conspiracy
    theories about a United Nations agenda to force people into plastic cities where
    they won't be allowed to own cars. Every other lawn has signs proclaiming economic
    ruin if drivers are forced to park a whopping 30 seconds away on side streets
    rather than directly in front of businesses.

- en: Sadly, history is repeating itself in San Francisco. Business interests in the
    West Portal neighborhood where the family was wiped out by a car are already organizing
    to stop any improvements to the street. This is a major transit hub in S.F., developed
    before cars were even in mass use, yet the jurisdiction of drivers knows no bounds.
    If there can’t be a car-free commercial strip in West Portal, there can’t be one
    anywhere in America. Some business groups see the death of that family as merely
    an unavoidable consequence, a price paid to ensure drivers don't have to walk
    an additional 30 seconds from parking on a side street to reach their shops. I
    don't think the merchants are bad people, but they are so indoctrinated by decades
    of car-centrism that they harm their own bottom line. A car-free corridor would
