    mean you’ll get exactly that if you go to an exchange house (legal or illegal).

- en: To give you have an idea, within the first 2 days in Argentina, I dealt with
    over five different rates. A restaurant actually offered me the proper *blue*
    rate (1100) to pay for the bill, whereas one *cueva* (informal exchange house)
    offered me 1050 and another 1070\. The kiosk where I bought a SIM card from had
    it at 1060, and Uber, who did the currency conversion themselves rather than leaving
    it up to my credit card, did it at 1000.

    letters outside, even though I’m still not sure it was entirely legal.

    the laundry place suggested. It pretended to be a travel agency, with all sorts
    of pictures of trips on the wall and pamphlets advertising tours on the table
    next to the couch. While I was there, a soldier walked in and I tensed up, only
    to realize he was there to exchange money himself.

- en: Anyway, so things get tricky and doing research can save you a fair bit. A lot
    of cards will convert at the official (white) rate for example, which can mean
    you’re taking a hit of over 20% compared to exchanging cash or using some other
    services like Western Union to get pesos (but I won’t get into that here).

- en: Another thing that adds to the complexity is that while I was there, the largest
    denomination of a bill available was 2000 pesos, and those were hard to come by
    as they were new. While 20,000 and 50,000 peso bills are on the way, the vast

  zh: 另一个增加复杂性的因素是，在我在那里的时候，可用的最大面额是2000比索，而且这些新钞票很难得到。虽然20,000和50,000比索的钞票正在途中，但在大部分时间里，我只能用1000比索的钞票，这让我很不方便，因为用它们来支付东西很烦人。

  zh: 好吧，我们通过*Booking.com*预订了价格固定的房间，但是到了那里，告诉我们可以用美元和比索支付现金。然而，出于我仍然不完全理解的原因，她如果我用比索现金支付，以*白色*汇率给我报价。
- en: When selling dollars, the *white* rate for me is bad, as it means for my one
    dollar I’ll get fewer pesos. However, in this case I was effectively buying dollars,
    and she was offering a fantastic rate.
  id: totrans-split-40

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 当我出售美元时，“白色”汇率对我来说很糟糕，因为这意味着我的一美元将换得更少的比索。然而，在这种情况下，我实际上是在购买美元，而她提供了一个极好的汇率。
- en: If this is confusing, let me put it in simpler terms. Let’s use round numbers
    and imagine the price we agreed on for the stay (through *Booking.com*) was 200$.
    I thus came with 200$ in my pocket but was told I could pay the equivalent in
    pesos at the *white* rate, which would mean 160,000 pesos.
  id: totrans-split-41
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 如果这让你感到困惑，让我用更简单的话来说。我们使用大约的数字来想象，通过*Booking.com*预定的住宿价格是200美元。因此，我口袋里带了200美元，但被告知可以以“白色”汇率的比索支付等值，这意味着160,000比索。
- en: So rather than giving her my supposedly equivalent 200$, I go to the *cueva*
    two blocks down and exchange my 200$ at a near-blue rate (say 1070) and get 214,000
    pesos back. I then pay her the 160,000 and still have 54,000 left. (Which, by
    the way, were I to sell, I’d get a rate of maybe 1030 for, meaning I’d still have
    52 or so dollars left.)
  id: totrans-split-42
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 所以，与其给她我所谓的等值200美元，我去了两个街区外的“*cueva*”，按近期的“蓝色”汇率（比如1070）换了200美元，得到了214,000比索。然后我支付给她160,000比索，还剩下54,000比索。（顺便说一句，如果我要出售的话，我可能能以1030的汇率出售，这意味着我还会剩下大约52美元左右。）
- en: And thus, you can only begin to imagine how complicated day-to-day can get for
    regular Argentinians. You might think they don’t need to deal with all this dollar
    rate BS if they don’t want to, but in reality they kind of do. In some places
    businesses are almost forced to accept dollars and both for businesses and individuals
    ensuring you have dollars is essential for retaining wealth in a country where
    the currency is worth less and less each day.

  zh: 因此，你只能想象日常生活对普通阿根廷人来说有多复杂。你可能认为他们如果不愿意的话，根本不需要处理这些美元汇率问题，但实际上他们确实需要。在一些地方，企业几乎被迫接受美元，无论是对企业还是个人来说，确保持有美元对于在货币每天贬值的国家保持财富至关重要。
- en: It also didn’t just stop there. January saw 20% inflation, meaning from the
    day we crossed the border from Uruguay to Argentina to the day we crossed the
    border back to Brazil, about a month later, prices were about 20% higher. Not
    only that, while we were there, the *blue* exchange rate spiked all the way to
    1200 and then back to 1100, with the parallel market keeping up-to-date with it
    daily. Just a few days apart, a hotel exchanged money for us for 1200 while a
    *cueva* quoted me 1050, aiming to take advantage of those not keeping up with
    the rate having gone up from 1100.

  zh: 情况并不仅仅如此。一月份通胀率达到20%，这意味着从我们从乌拉圭过境到阿根廷，一个月后再从阿根廷过境回巴西的这段时间内，价格上涨了大约20%。不仅如此，我们在那里期间，“蓝色”汇率一度飙升到1200，然后回落到1100，而且平行市场每天都在跟进更新。仅仅相隔几天，一家酒店以1200的汇率为我们兑换，而一个“cueva”则向我报价1050，旨在利用那些未能跟上汇率上涨的人。
