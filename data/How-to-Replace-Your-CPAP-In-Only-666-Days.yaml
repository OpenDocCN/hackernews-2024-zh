    with the billing codes, and ODI does not intervene in billing code issues. They
    have, however, initiated a secretive second investigation. There is no way to
    contact the second investigator.

- en: 'Wait. On day 636, receive a letter from Anthem’s appeals department. They’ve
    received your request for an appeal. You never filed one. They want your doctor
    or facility to provide additional information to Carelon Medical Benefits Management.
    You have never heard of Carelon. There is no explanation of how to reach Carelon,
    or what information they might require. The letter concludes: “There is currently
    no authorization on file for the services rendered.” You need to seek authorization
    from a department called “Utilization Management”.'
