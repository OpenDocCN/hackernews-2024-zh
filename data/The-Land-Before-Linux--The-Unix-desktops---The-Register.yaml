    I've been a Unix fan since 1979, when [2BSD Unix](https://opensource.fandom.com/wiki/Berkeley_Software_Distribution)

    for Unix, they were too general to do much good – for example [Portable Operating

- en: While the Unix companies were busy ripping each other to shreds, Microsoft was
    smiling all the way to the bank. The core problem was that the Unix companies
    couldn't settle on software standards. Independent Software Vendors (ISV) had
    to write applications for each Unix platform. Each of these had only a minute
    desktop market share. It simply made no business sense for programmers to write
    one version of an application for SCO OpenDesktop (also known as OpenDeathtrap),
    another for NeXTStep, and still another one for SunOS.
