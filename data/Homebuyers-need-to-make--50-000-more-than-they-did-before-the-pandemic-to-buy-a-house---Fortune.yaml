- en: These factors led to an extremely strained market in which many homeowners clung
    to their [current properties](https://fortune.com/2023/10/17/housing-market-prices-affordability-lock-in-fannie-mae/)
    in fear of higher mortgage rates and fewer new buyers could afford to buy a home.
    Indeed, housing affordability has gotten so bad that prospective buyers need to
    make about $50,000 more now than pre-pandemic in order to “comfortably” afford
    a home, according to a [Zillow report](https://www.zillow.com/research/buyers-income-needed-33755/)
    released Thursday. And affording a home goes beyond monthly mortgage payments,
    experts agree.

- en: “Comfortably affording a home in today’s market means having the financial capacity
    to cover mortgage payments, property taxes, insurance, and other associated costs
    without significant financial strain,” Stacy Brown, director of technical training
    at [Real Property Management](https://www.realpropertymgt.com/), tells *Fortune*.
    Considering “the fact that the boomer generation is staying in their homes rather
    than moving to retirement communities, as well as those who moved to the suburbs
    during the pandemic [choosing to work] remotely—comfortable home ownership is
    out of reach for many.”

    more than January 2020, [Zillow](https://fortune.com/company/zillow-group/) says.
    Monthly mortgage payments on a “typical home,” which Zillow defines as costing
    $343,000, have nearly doubled in that time frame to $2,188, assuming a 10% down
    payment. And while mortgage rates and home prices are the main culprits behind
    today’s housing affordability challenges, there are other factors that make buying
    a home more costly.

    also haven’t kept up with the demands of a home purchase. A household earning
    a $59,000 salary in 2020 could comfortably afford the monthly mortgage, meaning
    they wouldn’t spend more than 30% of their income with a 10% down payment, according
    to Zillow. That was below the U.S. median income at the time, which clocked in
