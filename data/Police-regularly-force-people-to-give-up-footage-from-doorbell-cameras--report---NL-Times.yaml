- en: The police regularly force Netherlands residents to give up footage recorded
    by their doorbell cameras for crime investigations. Communication with the public
    always focuses on voluntary cooperation between the police and citizens, but in
    practice, the police almost always use coercion, [BNR](https://www.bnr.nl/nieuws/juridisch/10538281/deurbelcamera-maakt-burgers-tot-doelwit-dwangmiddelen-politie)
    reports after its own investigation. “The rise of the smart doorbell has made
    citizens the target of coercive measures on a large scale,” the broadcaster concluded.

  zh: 警方经常强迫荷兰居民交出门铃摄像头记录的录像以进行犯罪调查。据BNR在进行自己的调查后报道，公共传播总是侧重于警察与公民之间的自愿合作，但在实践中，警方几乎总是使用强迫手段。广播公司得出结论说，“智能门铃的普及使公民成为大规模强制措施的目标。”
- en: A resident of the Randje Ondiep neighborhood in Utrecht got two police officers
    on her doorstep after an explosion nearby. The cops spotted her smart doorbell
    from the street. “If you could provide images, that would be very nice,” they
    told her. She gave them her email address and, within a few hours, received a
    demand email containing threatening legal language. She had to submit images within
    seven days. Refusing is a punishable offense. “I wasn’t even sure I had images,
    so I’m worried about what will happen if I can’t provide any,” she told BNR.

  zh: 乌得勒支Randje Ondiep社区的一名居民在附近发生爆炸后，有两名警察来到她家门口。警察从街上看到了她的智能门铃。“如果你能提供图像，那就太好了，”他们告诉她。她给了他们她的电子邮件地址，几小时后收到了一封包含威胁性法律用语的要求邮件。她必须在七天内提交图像。拒绝是一种可罚的行为。“我甚至不确定我是否有图像，所以我担心如果我不能提供任何图像会发生什么，”她告诉
    BNR。
- en: Inquiries by BNR at ten regional police forces, the National Police, and the
    Public Prosecution Service (OM) showed that requisitioning footage from owners
    of doorbell cameras is now standard practice. After a crime, police officers walk
    the neighborhood and check for cameras door to door. Refusing a demand for footage
    is a punishable offense that can lead to a fine or a prison sentence of up to
    three months. The OM told BNR that it has “not yet happened” that the owner of
    a doorbell camera refused to comply with a demand.

  zh: BNR向十个地区警察部门、国家警察和公诉部门（OM）的询问显示，要求门铃摄像头所有者提供录像现已成为标准做法。犯罪发生后，警察会在社区走访，逐家逐户检查摄像头。拒绝提供录像的要求是一种可罚的行为，可能会导致罚款或最多三个月的监禁。OM告诉BNR，“门铃摄像头的所有者拒绝遵守要求”“还没有发生过”。
- en: The implication is that anyone with a doorbell camera can become a target of
    such a demand, risking prison or a fine if they refuse. “The fact that the police
    can demand images fits in with a broader trend,” Vincent Böhre, lawyer and director
    of the Privacy First Foundation, told the broadcaster. “Namely, that citizens
    and companies increasingly seem to be becoming an extension of the police and
    judiciary.” Böhre worries about “a development towards a kind of police state.”

  zh: 暗示是，任何有门铃摄像头的人都可能成为这种要求的目标，如果拒绝可能面临监禁或罚款。“警方可以要求图像的事实符合更广泛的趋势，”隐私第一基金会的律师兼主任文森特·波尔告诉广播公司。“也就是说，公民和公司似乎越来越成为警察和司法机关的延伸。”波尔担心“向警察国家发展的趋势”。
- en: Lawyers also warned that the addresses of unsuspecting citizens could end up
    in criminal files as a result of the footage they provide. Suspects have the right
    to see all evidence against them, including the demand for footage, which shows
    the name and address of the doorbell camera’s owner. Such information can only
    be blocked out under exceptional circumstances, police spokesperson Luna van Heerwaarden
    said. For example, when “there have already been unpleasant experiences with the
    perpetrator.”

  zh: 律师还警告说，无辜公民的地址可能因他们提供的录像而进入刑事档案。嫌疑人有权看到针对他们的所有证据，包括对录像的要求，其中显示了门铃摄像头所有者的姓名和地址。警方发言人卢娜·范·海尔瓦登表示，只有在特殊情况下才能屏蔽此类信息，例如，“已经与肇事者发生不愉快的经历”时。
- en: According to BNR, a search through the online register of legal cases on Rechtspraak.nl
    showed that doorbell camera owners’ names and addresses do end up in criminal
    files. For example, footage from a doorbell camera was used as evidence in the
    fatal stabbing of a woman in Hengelo on 24 December 2019\. The camera owner’s
    name and address are included in the verdict.

  zh: 根据BNR的报道，通过在线法律案例注册的搜索结果显示，门铃摄像头的所有者姓名和地址确实会出现在刑事案件档案中。例如，2019年12月24日在亨格洛（Hengelo）发生的一起致命刺杀案中，门铃摄像头的录像被作为证据使用。摄像头所有者的姓名和地址都包含在判决中。
