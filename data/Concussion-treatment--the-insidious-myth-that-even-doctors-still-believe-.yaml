    a professor of neurochemistry at the University of Gothenburg in Sweden. But it
    turns out that to heal from a concussion, your brain doesn’t actually *need* to
    stitch together those damaged connections. When a major highway needs roadwork,
    commuters don’t just wait around until it’s complete. Instead, traffic gets diverted.
    That’s what happens after a concussion, Zetterberg said. When brain cells stretch
    and fray, signals get sent down other neural pathways. At first, this is incredibly
    taxing. You might feel exhausted, have pounding headaches, and be emotionally
    frazzled. You might struggle to complete tasks that once felt easy, like reading
    or doing basic math. Then, eventually, you might start to feel better. “That is
    not because the brain has healed,” Zetterberg said. “It is because the brain circuits
