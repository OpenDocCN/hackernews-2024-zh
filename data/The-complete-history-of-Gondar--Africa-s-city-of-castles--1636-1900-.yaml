    the main capital of the Ethiopian state. The establishment of a permanent capital
    represented a decisive break from the earlier tradition of a mobile capital, where
    the residence of the King and his court moved in circuits around the empire. Royal
    capitals such as Gondar and its predecessors in the 16th century such as Imfraz,
    Gorgorá, and Dánqáz, were large metropolises protected by stone fortresses that
    housed a cosmopolitan population. The bulk of the urban population were the Habäsha
    Christians, but also included significant communities of local Betä Ǝsraʾel and

    of his reign, Fasiladas constructed several churches, palaces, bridges in Gondar,
    creating the largest concentration of monuments in Ethiopia since the establishment
    of Lalibela. For the next century and a half, Fasiladas' sucessors would follow

    concepts of kingship enforced by Susǝnyos and accomplished by his heir Fasiladas.
    ***"Unlike his forbears, the king no longer defined his attributes by waging war

    son Iyo'as (r. 1755-1769). However, political power during this period was largely
    controlled by Bakaffa's consort; Empress Mentewwab. The latter had risen to prominence
    during the last years of Bakaffa's reign. Two of her relatives; Niqolawos and
    Arkaledes were appointed into prominent positions at the behest of Mentewwab's

    to announce that Iyasu had been designated sucessor. Iyasu was crowned immediately
    after, and his mother Mentewwab was also crowned in her own right on December
    2nd. From the beginning of Iyasu's reign, power rested with Mentewwab and her
    relatives. Following the death of Yolyana and Niqolawos in 1732, disgruntled nobles
    rebelled against the co-regents Mentewwab and Iyasu by besieging the Gondar castle
    compound in December 1732\. The rebellion was quickly suppressed and precipitated
    the rise of Walda Le'ul as the most important political figure of Mentewwab's
    reign.
