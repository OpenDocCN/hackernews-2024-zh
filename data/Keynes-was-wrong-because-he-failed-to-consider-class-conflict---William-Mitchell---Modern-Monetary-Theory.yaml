- en: I was asked during an interview the other day from Paris whether I was a Post
    Keynesian. I replied not at all and explained that I have never felt that my ideas
    fit into that category although in a facile sense we are all post keynesian in
    a temporal sense. Most progressive economists would answer yes if confronted with
    that question, even most of the economists involved in advancing Modern Monetary
    Theory (MMT). My point of departure is that while there was a lot of important
    analytical material in Keynes’ writing that is worth preserving and integrating
    into, say, MMT, where Keynes went astray was his antipathy to the insights provided
    by Karl Marx. In particular, I consider that Keynes seriously misunderstood what
    the dynamics of the class conflict were within a capitalist mode of production.
    Keynes made major errors in his predictions that one can directly attribute to
    this blinkered approach to capitalism. I was reminded of this when I read an Op
    Ed in the Japan Times this week (March 10, 2024) – [The economic future of our
    overworked grandchildren](https://www.japantimes.co.jp/commentary/2024/03/10/world/keynes-grandchildren-prediction-wrong/).
    This blinkered approach, which has fed into the modern Post Keynesian literature
    – which examines capitalism as if it is an ahistorical, neutral system of production
    and distribution – is a major reason that I do not associate my work with that
    school of thought.

  zh: 前几天在巴黎接受采访时，有人问我是否属于后凯恩斯派。我毫不犹豫地回答不是，并解释说，我从未觉得我的想法符合那一类别，虽然在某种程度上我们在时间上都可以被认为是后凯恩斯派。大多数进步派经济学家如果被问到这个问题，即使是大多数推动现代货币理论（MMT）的经济学家也会回答是的。我的观点是，尽管凯恩斯的著作中有很多重要的分析材料值得保留和整合，比如融入MMT，但凯恩斯在哪里走错了是他对卡尔·马克思提供的洞察的敌意。特别是，我认为凯恩斯严重误解了资本主义生产方式内部的阶级冲突动态。凯恩斯在他对资本主义的这种局限性方法下作出了重大错误的预测。当我本周（2024年3月10日）阅读《日本时报》的社论时，我想起了这一点
