  zh: 据报道，IBM再次因在其营销和传播部门裁员而成为头条新闻。
- en: The news was initially [reported](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/12/ibm-tells-employees-of-job-cuts-in-marketing-and-communications.html)
    today by CNBC, and doesn't include any mention of numbers. The layoffs were reportedly
    announced in a brief meeting with affected staffers today, a person with knowledge
    of the matter told CNBC.

  zh: 这则消息最初由CNBC今天报道，[报道](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/12/ibm-tells-employees-of-job-cuts-in-marketing-and-communications.html)中并未提及具体数字。据知情人士告诉CNBC，据报道，裁员是在今天与受影响员工的简短会议中宣布的。
- en: IBM has made no secret of its plans to cut staff of late, as we noted in an
    [exclusive story](https://www.theregister.com/2024/02/29/ibm_launches_voluntary_redundancy_scheme/)
    last month. Big Blue told us it was looking for employees to take a voluntary
    severance, primarily in its enterprise ops and support, Q2C, finance and operations
    divisions, the latter of which includes communications and marketing.

  zh: IBM最近的裁员计划并不是秘密，正如我们在上个月的[独家报道](https://www.theregister.com/2024/02/29/ibm_launches_voluntary_redundancy_scheme/)中所指出的那样。Big
    Blue告诉我们，它正在寻找愿意接受自愿离职的员工，主要是在其企业运营和支持、Q2C、财务和运营部门，后者包括通讯和营销。
- en: IBM said last month that the voluntary layoffs stemmed from plans to rebalance
    its workforce and would involve "a very low single digit percentage of IBM's global
    workforce." The company said it expected to end 2024 with "roughly" the same level
    of employment as it had at the beginning of the year.

  zh: IBM上个月表示，自愿裁员是基于重新平衡其员工队伍的计划，并将涉及“IBM全球员工总数的一个非常低的个位数百分比”。公司表示预计2024年的雇佣水平将与年初“大致相同”。
- en: '"This rebalancing is driven by increases in productivity and our continued
    push to align our workforce with the skills most in demand among our clients,
    especially areas such as AI and hybrid cloud," we were told in February.'

  zh: “这一重新平衡是由生产力的增加和我们继续努力将员工队伍与客户需求中最为热门的技能对齐所驱动的，特别是人工智能和混合云等领域，”我们在二月份被告知。
- en: IBM has also made no secret of plans to replace employees with AI. In an interview
    last year, IBM CEO Arvind Krishna said he thought [around 30 percent](https://www.theregister.com/2023/05/02/ibm_ai_back_office_jobs/)
    of IBM's back office staff, equating to roughly 7,800 people, could be replaced
    with the technology. Krishna said IBM would likely slow hiring in affected areas
    over the next five years, though what those areas are wasn't made clear.

  zh: IBM也并未隐瞒其用人计划，计划用人工智能替代员工。在去年的一次采访中，IBM首席执行官阿尔温德·克里希纳表示，他认为IBM约30%的后勤人员，大约7800人，可以用这项技术取而代之。克里希纳表示，IBM可能会在未来五年减缓在受影响领域的招聘速度，尽管这些领域并未明确说明。
- en: Since then, Krishna has also [said](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/12/07/ibm-ceo-arvind-krishna-cnbc-interview.html)
    that IBM was upskilling all its employees on AI, and rather than laying them off
    to be replaced with AI he saw those skills as a way to gain an economic advantage.

  zh: 自那时起，克里希纳还[表示](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/12/07/ibm-ceo-arvind-krishna-cnbc-interview.html)IBM正在提升所有员工的人工智能技能，他认为这些技能不仅不会裁员，而且是获得经济优势的一种方式。
- en: '"If you are more productive, that means you have a natural economic advantage
    against your competition, which means you''re going to get more work," Krishna
    said late last year. "I fundamentally believe we''ll get more jobs"'

    levels throughout 2024 and workforce realignment without confirming the news.
