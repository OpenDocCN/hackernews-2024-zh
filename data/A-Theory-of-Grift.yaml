    retail investors who looked at the chart of these products wouldn't necessarily
    know that 1) they were selling insurance over time, 2) the size of the inverse-volatility
    funds was actually affecting the price of volatility, adding to their returns

    they do for app-based dating sites. But within the same industry, some companies

    also prosper from a business model where everyone who is burned out by working

    infrastructure private equity firm Global Infrastructure Partners for $12.5bn](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240112400876/en/BlackRock-Agrees-to-Acquire-Global-Infrastructure-Partners-%E2%80%9CGIP%E2%80%9D-Creating-a-World-Leading-Infrastructure-Private-Markets-Investment-Platform?ref=thediff.co).
    BlackRock has had some solid acquisitions in the past, but their previous big
    acquisition, Barclays Global Investors, was partly a way to achieve scale in the
    intrinsically scale-driven game of managing indexed assets. GIP is a very different
    model, funding the acquisition or construction of ports, airports, and energy
    assets.

- en: If we are going to decarbonize the world, the amount of capital and infrastructure
    is going to be very necessary. If we are going to be more and more reliant on
    interconnectivity worldwide, the need for the upgrading of ports is vital. As
    more and more human beings grow into a middle-class lifestyle, the demand for
    air travel grows dramatically, the need for high-quality airports grows dramatically.

- en: 'Passive investing is implicitly a bet on globalization, which leads to economic
    convergence. And BlackRock has been pressuring portfolio companies to adopt ESG
    standards for years. So this fits in with their broader strategy: reduce the world''s
    aggregate capital expenditures for carbon-intensive assets to create more demand
    for carbon-mitigating assets, most of which have a longer duration than dirtier
    energy sources; create global portfoliosto slowly apply pressure on the rest of
    the world to conform to American standards for corporate governance and property
    rights. BlackRock is not the world''s most influential organization, but at their
    scale it''s impossible for them not to have an impact—and that impact is big enough
    that they can do deals to take advantage of it.'

  zh: 被动投资实际上是对全球化的一种赌注，这导致经济趋同。多年来，BlackRock一直在向投资组合公司施压，要求其采用ESG标准。因此，这符合他们更广泛的战略：减少世界各地碳密集型资产的总体资本支出，以创造对碳减排资产的更多需求，其中大多数的持续时间都比更脏的能源来源长；创建全球投资组合，逐渐对世界其他地区施加压力，使其遵守美国的企业治理和产权标准。BlackRock并不是世界上最有影响力的组织，但在他们的规模下，他们不可能没有影响力——而且这种影响力足够大，以至于他们可以达成交易，利用这种影响力。

    When company growth within an industry is a function of pricing power instead
    of rising unit volume, reaching the limit of that pricing power creates immense
    uncertainty—sometimes, one part of the value chain will grow and eat most of the
    margin, while in other cases aggregate profits will shrink fast as everyone fights

    it, but in the end everyone involved is in the market for a bit less uncertainty.'

    as captured by the dispersion in estimates](https://snippet.finance/dispersion-of-estimates/?ref=thediff.co).
    The short-term spikes in the chart have a simple driver: when there''s an industry
    downturn, some analysts cut estimates fast and others take their time, so average
    earnings estimates going from $1 to $0.50 can represent half of the analysts cutting
    their estimates to $0.00 while the other half haven''t gotten around to it yet.
    (That''s one reason for the big increase in early 2015: everyone knew oil companies
    would take a giant earnings hit from the collapse in oil prices, but not everyone
    published this promptly.) What the chart highlights is that uncertainty has gone
    up post-Covid, and mostly stayed there. There''s been a lively debate since about
    which companies'' economics permanently reset higher (like sporting goods retailers
    seeing their net margins rise by ~50%) while others seem to have reset lower (Delta
    airlines'' headcount is 10% higher than it was pre-pandemic, at a similar business
    size). Every quarter is either evidence that things are returning to normal or
    evidence that we''re in a new normal.'

  zh: Snippet Finance制作了一张有关分析师对公司收益不确定性的漂亮图表，如何捕捉到估计值的差异。图表中的短期波动有一个简单的驱动因素：当行业出现衰退时，一些分析师迅速削减估计值，而其他分析师则花费更多时间，因此平均收益估计从$1下降到$0.50可以表示一半的分析师将其估计值削减为$0.00，而另一半则尚未完成。
    （这是2015年初大幅增加的一个原因：每个人都知道石油公司将受到油价崩溃的巨大收益打击，但并不是每个人都及时发布了这一信息。）图表突出显示，不确定性在疫情后上升，并大部分保持在那里。自那以后，关于哪些公司的经济情况永久性地重置更高（例如体育用品零售商的净利润率上升约50%）而其他公司似乎已经降低了（达美航空公司的员工人数比疫情前增加了10%，业务规模相似）。每个季度都是证据，证明事情正在恢复正常，或者证明我们正在进入一个新的常态。

- en: Morgan Stanley has [settled a complaint with the SEC over block trading](https://www.sec.gov/files/litigation/admin/2024/34-99337.pdf?ref=thediff.co).
    The way block trades are supposed to work is that a seller wants to move a large
    amount of stock with minimal market impact, and instead of dumping it on the market,
    they sell it to a counterparty (often Morgan Stanley) who then promptly sells
    to their customers. The bank's value-add is that they know more about what market
    depth looks like conditional on a large sale, and is willing to take some risk
    that their estimate is wrong. Suppose there's a stock trading at $42, and a seller
    wants to get rid of 10m shares. Perhaps they estimate that the price impact of
    selling would knock the stock down to $40, but Morgan Stanley figures they could
    sell carefully enough to only push the stock to $41\. Morgan Stanley offers $40.50,
    makes a $0.50/share profit, and saves their customer $0.50/share, too.

  zh: 摩根士丹利已经与SEC就大宗交易问题达成和解。大宗交易的工作原理是，卖方希望以最小的市场影响移动大量股票，而不是将其抛售到市场上，他们将其卖给一个交易对手（通常是摩根士丹利），然后迅速转手卖给他们的客户。银行的附加值在于，他们更了解在大笔交易条件下市场深度是什么样子，并愿意承担一些风险，以免他们的估计错误。假设有一只股票以$42交易，卖方希望摆脱1000万股。也许他们估计卖出的价格将使股票跌至$40，但摩根士丹利认为他们可以小心地卖出，只将股票推至$41。摩根士丹利报价$40.50，每股获利$0.50，并也为他们的客户节省了$0.50每股。

    information about it to potential buyers so they can profit from that initial
    drop (and, presumably, this customer will owe Morgan Stanley a favor and buy into
    future deals that are harder to sell). This is a straightforward wealth transfer
    from one client (the seller) to another client (the prospective buyer), and increases
    the market impact of the trade—once the hedge fund knows an offer is coming, their
    incentive is to short the stock aggressively and then cover by buying into the
    offering. Once the offering is committed, it''s hard to back out even if there
    are fluctuations, and Morgan Stanley''s customers probably don''t audit every
    block trade Morgan Stanley ever did to see if there''s some kind of pre-trade
    price impact indicating a leak.'

- en: 'There is an obvious temptation here, because the block trader has basically
    been told "there''s a specific time at which this stock will move by a predictable
    amount, and while you yourself can''t trade on it, somebody else would clearly
    owe you a favor if they did." The people doing this trade were pretty aggressive
    about it: one part of the SEC document references a case where one fund was 89%
    of the trading volume in a stock the afternoon before an offer. And Morgan Stanley
    even pitched customers on giving them exclusive rights to do the deal—by citing
    the price impact of a leak they themselves were responsible for! (It was, in fact,
    the same transaction where one fund tipped off by Morgan Stanley did almost all
    the trading volume in the stock.) The real trouble with this, from a white collar
    crime optimization standpoint, is that once someone goes looking, it''s very easy
    to assemble evidence of exactly what happened: a straightforward illicit trading
    strategy is straightforwardly easy to spot after the fact.'

    进行这种交易的人非常积极：SEC文件的一个部分提到了一个基金在要约前一天下午占据了一只股票89%的交易量的案例。甚至摩根士丹利还向客户推销给他们独家做交易的权利——通过引用他们自己负责的泄密造成的价格影响！（事实上，这是同一笔交易，摩根士丹利向其泄露信息的一个基金几乎完成了该股票的所有交易量。）从白领犯罪优化的角度来看，这样做的真正麻烦之处在于，一旦有人开始寻找，就很容易收集到确切发生的事情的证据：一种直接的非法交易策略在事后很容易被发现。

    (Even someone writing in an ad trade magazine is surprised that PF is getting
    so much into ads.) Every in-person business is, from an advertiser''s perspective,
    an audience that has been pre-selected based on some traits that predict other
    kinds of spending, and that is somewhat captive because the venue can control
    the local media environment. Naturally, this model works even better with a membership/loyalty
    program that makes it possible to track who saw which ad, and to retarget them
    later through an app. Planet Fitness is not one of the companies that will end
    up switching to an entirely ad-supported business, of course. But the gym business
    is already built on paying fixed costs in order to achieve high-incremental margin
    revenue. In fact, this is a sort of usage-based hedge: the customer who signs
    up because of their New Years Resolution in January and stops showing up in March
    is pure margin until they inevitably cancel; now, the customer who insists on
    continuing to work out throughout the year can contribute revenue, too.'
