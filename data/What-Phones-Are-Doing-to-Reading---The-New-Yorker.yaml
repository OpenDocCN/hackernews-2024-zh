- en: For the past five years or so, I’ve read books on my phone. The practice started
    innocently enough. I write book reviews from time to time, and so publishers sometimes
    send me upcoming titles that fall roughly within my interests. When a publisher
    provided a choice between a PDF of a book and a physical copy, I would usually
    ask for the PDF, because I didn’t want my house to fill up with books that I might
    end up not reading. But what was at first a matter of clutter-free convenience
    became a habit, and now I encounter nearly every written work, regardless of its
    length, quality, and difficulty, on the small screen of my iPhone.

    “reading,” a term that suggests something edifying or educational. Even book apps,
    I find, can feel like a sort of in-between, not the time suck of social media
    but also not the comfortable absorption of a good paperback. There’s something
    about scrolling and tapping that leads to a quick calcification of muscle memory.
    You start to tap on the same things not out of familiarity or comfort but out
    of sheer habit. Now that I read on my phone, I give up on new books more quickly
    than I used to. I go back to the same stuff over and over, in the same way that
    I watch the same YouTube videos over and over. I’m not entirely sure why I get
    mired in such a rut; part of it, I suspect, is just that I’m getting older. Of
    the books I’ve recently downloaded, only the Cusk came to me via recommendation

    like Twitter to the device, but doing so is clearly not the point. The screen

    that cell-phone addiction was driven, in part, by the bright colors on our phone.
    Turning your phone display to gray scale would, it was suggested, make things
    feel less immersive and a bit drearier; this, in turn, would help you cut down
    on your screen time. Of course, even if this trick works, you can always change
    your phone back whenever you want. The Palma, though, does not have color options,
    nor does it have cellular service, and that means you cannot connect to the Internet
    without Wi-Fi. You can take the device on long, contemplative walks, listening

    ago, I subscribed to the *Financial Times’s* Kindle delivery service; I pictured
    myself sitting at the table in our kitchen with a bowl of oatmeal, a pot of coffee,
    and the gray-scale version of the *F.T.*, which might not be as nice as the print
