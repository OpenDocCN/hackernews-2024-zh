    bookings worth €3.6 billion ($3.8 billion) fell short of analyst expectations,
    and were considerably down from the record $9.1 billion ($9.6 billion) in Q4 of

    (EUV) photolithography equipment for making the most advanced semiconductors,
    ASML should be able to ride out any troughs in order bookings. A new wave of chip
    fabrication plants are being constructed around the world, notably in the US thanks

    aperture) EUV equipment, which provides better resolution for smaller features
    with the most advanced production processes. Intel was the [first customer](https://www.reuters.com/technology/asml-ships-first-high-na-lithography-system-intel-statement-2023-12-21/)

  zh: Dassen表示，ASML预计会看到其High NA（数值孔径）EUV设备的销量增加，该设备在最先进的生产工艺中为更小的特征提供更好的分辨率。英特尔是今年早些时候在其俄勒冈州希尔斯伯勒设施中接收到TWINSCAN
    EXE:5200系统的[首个客户](https://www.reuters.com/technology/asml-ships-first-high-na-lithography-system-intel-statement-2023-12-21/)。
- en: '"The industry is really excited around High NA and for very good reasons,"
    Dassen claimed. "If you look at the specifications of the High NA tool, it will
    provide a transistor density that actually is 3x of the transistor density that
    you will have with a low NA tool. So it''s a really big step up," he said.'
