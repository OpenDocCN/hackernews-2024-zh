    on a SpaceX rocket and was launched into orbit. MethaneSAT, as the new satellite
    is called, is the latest to join more than a dozen other instruments currently
    circling the Earth monitoring emissions of the ultra-powerful greenhouse gas methane.
    But it won’t be the last. Over the next several months, at least two additional
    methane-detecting satellites from the U.S. and Japan are scheduled to join the

    existing images, their resolution, and the amount of time it takes to get them.
    One of the challenges, Thorpe said, is that it’s very hard to get a continuous
    picture of any given leak. Oil and gas equipment can spring leaks at random. They
    can leak continuously or intermittently. If you’re just getting a snapshot every
    few weeks, you may not be able to tell how long a leak lasted, or you might miss
    a short but significant plume. Meanwhile, oil and gas fields are also changing
    on a weekly basis, Joost de Gouw, an atmospheric chemist at the University of
    Colorado, Boulder, told me. New wells are being drilled in new places — places
