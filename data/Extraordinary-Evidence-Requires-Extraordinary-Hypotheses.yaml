    offer durable [sterilizing immunity](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9595357/)
    against Covid. A reasonable best-guess might be that each booster dose provides
    a 50/50 chance of sterilizing immunity that might last as little as six months
    — especially if major new variants emerge. In stark contrast, a single dose of
    the [HPV vaccine](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25420478/) provides a near-guarantee
    of sterilizing immunity that lasts at least a decade and effectively cross-protects
    you against related HPV variants that weren’t even in the vaccine. What accounts

    extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence (ECREE). In school, I was

    Dogma “everybody knows” but that nevertheless sometimes turns out to be disastrously

    require evidence, in a way that’s pretty much upside-down from ECREE. It’s equally
