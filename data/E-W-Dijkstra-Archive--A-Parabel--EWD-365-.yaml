  zh: 一则寓言
- en: '"Years ago a railway company was erected and one of its directors --probably
    the commercial bloke-- discovered that the initial investment could be reduced
    significantly if only fifty percent of the cars would be equipped with a toilet
    and, therefore, so was decided.'

- en: '"Shortly after the company had started its operations, however, complaints
    about toilets came pouring in. An investigation was carried out and showed that
    the obvious thing had happened: despite its youth the company was already suffering
    from internal communication problems, for the director''s decision on the toilets
    had not been transmitted to the shunting yard where all cars were treated as equivalent
    and, as a result, sometimes trains were composed with hardly any toilets at all.'

- en: '"In order to solve the problem, a bit of information was associated with each
    car, telling whether it was a car with or without toilet and the shunting yard
    was instructed to compose trains with the number of cars of both types as equal
    as possible. It was a complication on the shunting yard but, once it had been
    solved, the people responsible for the shunting procedures were quite proud that
    they could manage it.'

- en: '"When the new shunting procedures had been made effective, however, complaints
    about the toilets continued to come in. A new investigation was carried out and
    then it transpired that, although in each train about half of the cars had indeed
    toilets, sometimes trains were composed with nearly all toilets in one half of
    the train. In order to remedy the situation, new instructions were issued, telling
    that cars with and cars without toilets should alternate. This was a more severe
    complication for the shunting people, but after some initial grumbling, eventually
    they managed.'

  zh: '"然而，当新的调车程序生效后，关于厕所的投诉继续涌入。进行了新的调查，结果发现，尽管每列火车大约有一半的车辆确实配备了厕所，但有时候列车几乎全都集中在列车的一半区域内。为了解决这一问题，发布了新的指示，要求带有厕所和没有厕所的车辆交替排列。这对调车人员来说是更严重的复杂化，但经过一些初步的抱怨后，他们最终还是解决了。'
- en: '"Complaints, however, continued and the reason turned out to be that, as cars
    with a toilet had a toilet at one of their ends, the distance between two successive
    toilets in the train could still be nearly three car lengths and for mothers with
    children in urgent need --and perhaps even luggage piled up in the corridor--
    this still could lead to disasters. As a result, the cars with toilets got another
    bit of information attached to them, making them into directed objects and the
    new instructions were, that in each train the cars with toilets should have the
    same orientation. This time the new instructions were received with less than
    enthusiasm, for the number of turntables was hardly sufficient; to be quite fair
    to the shunting people we must even admit that according to all reasonable standards,
    the number of turntables was insufficient and it was only by virtue of the most
    cunning ingenuity that they could just manage.'

    也许甚至还有堆积在走廊上的行李 -- 这可能导致灾难。因此，配有厕所的车辆又附加了另一部分信息，使它们成为定向对象，并且新的指示是，在每列列车中，配有厕所的车辆应该具有相同的方向。这次，新的指示收到的热情不如以往，因为转盘的数量几乎不够；要完全公平对待调车人员，我们必须甚至承认，按照所有合理的标准，转盘的数量是不足的，只是凭借最狡猾的智慧，他们才能勉强处理。'
- en: '"With all toilets equally spaced along the train the company felt confident
    that now everything was all right, but passengers continued to complain: although
    no passenger was more than a car length away from the nearest toilet, passengers
    (in urgent need) did not know in which direction to start their stumbling itinerary
    along the corridor! To solve the problem, arrows saying "TOILET" were fixed in
    all corridors, making also the other half of the cars into directed objects that
    should be properly oriented by the shunting procedures.'

- en: '"When the new instructions reached the shunting yard, they created an atmosphere
    ranging from despair to revolt: it just couldn''t be done! At that critical moment
    a man whose name has been forgotten and shall never be traced, made the following
    observation. If each car with a toilet was coupled, from now until eternity, at
    its toileted end with a car without a toilet, then, from now onwards, the shunting
    yard, instead of dealing with N directed cars of two types, could deal with N/2
    identical units that to all intents and purposes could be regarded as symmetrical.
    And this solution solved all shunting problems at the modest price of, firstly,
    sticking to trains with an even number of cars only --the few additional cars
    needed for that could be paid out of the initial savings effected by the commercial
    bloke!-- and, secondly, slightly cheating with regard to the equal spacing of
    the toilets. But after all, who cares about the last three feet?'
