- en: I stopped drinking alcohol on November 10th 2020 after my first (and only) panic
    attack led to me question what the fuck I was doing with my life. I thought a
    lot about how the future might play out for me if I continued with the same lifestyle.
    I didn’t decide to stop drinking but I haven’t felt like getting drunk since.

  zh: 2020年11月10日，经历了我人生中第一次（也是唯一一次）惊恐发作后，我停止了饮酒。我仔细思考了如果我继续过着相同的生活方式，未来可能会怎样。我并没有决定停止饮酒，但自那以后我再也没有想过要喝醉。
- en: Stopping has had a profound impact on me. For the first 6 months I felt like
    absolute shit. Alcohol was the only coping mechanism I had for stress, the only
    social lubricant I had to make being in groups of people tolerable, the only thing
    I had in common with most of my friends, and subsequently pretty much the only
    thing I had looked forward to. Taking that away left me with fuck all to enjoy
    and a creeping suspicion that I might never be happy or relaxed ever again.

  zh: 停止饮酒对我产生了深远的影响。最初的六个月我感觉非常糟糕。酒精是我应对压力的唯一机制，是我在社交场合中能够忍受的唯一社交润滑剂，是我与大多数朋友共同的唯一点，因此几乎是我期待的唯一事物。把这些都拿走后，我几乎没有什么可以享受的了，还感到自己可能永远不会再快乐或放松。
- en: Drinking is a huge part of the culture here and we tend to start young. It’s
    the fuel for almost all social engagements and an overwhelmingly common way to
    cope with life in general. I drank more than the average person, but not close
    to what would be considered excessive.

  zh: 在这里，饮酒是文化的重要组成部分，我们倾向于从年轻时开始。它几乎是所有社交活动的动力来源，也是一种极其普遍的应对生活的方式。我比普通人喝得多，但远不到被视为过量的程度。
- en: It took around 18 months before I felt any better. The sense of growing pressure
    eased off and I started to feel very steady, both emotionally and temperamentally.
    At the time of writing it’s been just over three years since I stopped. My mood
    is very consistent — I have barely any unprovoked ups-and-downs. Whenever I do
    feel down, it’s much easier to cope with because everything else in my head stays
    consistent. I have a much clearer idea of who I am, how I want to behave, and
    reassurance that I will continue to feel the same because I’m not planning on
    deliberately altering my mental state any time soon.

  zh: 过了大约18个月我才感觉好转。逐渐减轻的压力感让我开始感到非常稳定，情绪和脾气都变得很平和。写下这些文字时，我已经停止饮酒超过三年了。我的情绪非常稳定
    —— 几乎没有不受控制的起伏。即使偶尔感到沮丧，也更容易应对，因为我的思维状态保持一致。我更清楚地知道自己是谁，如何行为，也更有信心自己会一直保持这种状态，因为我暂时不打算刻意改变自己的精神状态。
- en: I have never been prone to wild mood swings or outbursts but I am still much
    calmer since stopping; I can’t think of a single time I’ve gotten genuinely angry
    and I feel far less inclined to escalate confrontation. The one negative consequence
    is that I feel anxiety more than I did before (or at least I can’t drink to alleviate
    the anxiety that I also had previously, so now I have to actually suffer it).
    It’s mostly in busy social settings around new people.

  zh: 自从停止饮酒后，我变得更加平静，尽管我从未容易情绪波动或爆发过，但我现在更加冷静；我想不出有过一次是我真正生气的时候，而且我感觉自己不再倾向于升级对抗。唯一的消极影响是，我比以前更容易感到焦虑（或者至少我无法通过喝酒来减轻之前也有的焦虑，所以现在必须真正忍受它）。这种感觉主要出现在繁忙的社交场合中，特别是在新认识的人周围。
- en: Since I haven’t made any deliberate effort to manage stress or any of the other
    stuff in any other way, I’m confident that most of the improvement in how I feel
    is down to a combination of stopping alcohol and maybe mellowing a bit with age.
    I think a significant part of the benefit of stopping could be put down to having
    removed myself from the very ego-fuelled environments where excessive drinking
    usually happens; bars and clubs particularly.

  zh: 由于我没有刻意去管理压力或其他方式来处理，我相信我感觉好转的大部分原因归结于停止饮酒，也可能是随着年龄增长而变得更加温和的结合效果。我认为停止饮酒带来的显著好处之一是，我已经摆脱了那些过度饮酒的、充满自我推动的环境；尤其是酒吧和夜总会。
- en: Naturally if you stop doing something and feel better for it, your instinct
    is to assume the same would be true for everyone, but I don’t know. People have
    very different relationships with alcohol and what is better for me is not necessarily
    better for someone else. If someone had told me to stop to drinking because it
    would make me feel better I’d have told them to fuck off. Most of the fun I had
    while growing up is down to being drunk, so I definitely don’t regret having done
    it. Still, I do feel that if people who have the same relationship with alcohol
    that I had stopped drinking for long enough to feel the benefit they wouldn’t
    want to drink again.

  zh: 如果你停止做某件事情，并且因此感觉更好，你的直觉会认为对每个人都是如此，但我不确定。人们与酒精有着非常不同的关系，对我好的未必对别人也好。如果有人告诉我停止饮酒会让我感觉更好，我会告诉他们滚蛋。在我成长过程中大部分的乐趣都是因为喝醉了，所以我绝对不后悔这么做过。不过，我确实觉得，如果和我有相似酒精关系的人停止饮酒足够长的时间以感受到好处，他们就不会想再喝了。
