    has been mentioned previously [here](https://ludic.mataroa.blog/blog/fury-driven-development/).
    The only reason I say *manager* instead of *leader* is that we worked in an organization
    that was fundamentally disempowering, so we spent most of our time trying the
    conventional corporate wisdom of "educating our stakeholders", which did not work,
    I've never seen work, and I've never met someone that has seen it cause *true*
    organizational transformation. But he did the hard work, knew the tools, *read*,
    and took care of the team. It was *really simple*, and I learned that there's
    no real trick to this. Use your brain and your empathy.

  zh: 我曾经共事过的最好的*经理*是Healthscope的Dave Coulter，在之前的[这里](https://ludic.mataroa.blog/blog/fury-driven-development/)已经提到过。我之所以说*经理*而不是*领导*，是因为我们在一个根本上剥夺权力的组织中工作，所以我们大部分时间都在尝试传统的企业智慧“教育我们的利益相关者”，这并不奏效，我从未见过奏效的情况，也未曾见过能够引起*真正*组织转型的人。但他做了艰苦的工作，了解了工具，*阅读*，并关心团队。这很*简单*，我学到了没有真正的窍门。动动你的脑筋和同理心。

    my own, [Stephen Deutsch](https://www.linkedin.com/in/stephen-deutsch-au) in the
    state government (the surprise is because the government is genuinely pretty bad
    at most things). I was burned out on tech work by the time I got to him, and I
    remember *still* enjoying working with him. We were in the fire service, which
    occupies a place of huge civic importance in the Australian psyche, and he would
    turn up and be absolutely honest every single day. Right as the latent burnout
    from my previous role reached a crescendo, I told him I intended to leave for
    a place that was offering me three days of work a week so I could do some recovering.

- en: Over the course of a call, he commiserated, shared his own struggles with me,
    and then *completely unilaterally disarmed*. He got me an offer to work there
    for three days a week, explained that it would never be as stable as taking a
    permanent role doing the same elsewhere, further explained that I currently had
    a lot of power due to the way their budget and projects were set up, and otherwise
    completely collapsed his own negotiating position so that I would have the tools
    to take care of myself. It made his life substantially harder in exchange for

- en: I ended up leaving, and he made the decision to leave easier, yes. But we stayed
    in touch because you don't run into people like that every day. He's a co-director

  zh: 我考虑过自己进入领导角色，看看究竟是什么感觉，但这件事情复杂性不容小觑。
- en: 'The first one is that I don''t think leadership roles should really exist in
    many domains, as I''ve indicated earlier. Leadership should naturally flow between
    team members based on the task being performed, competence of each member, and
    psychodynamic energy (read again: vibes) on any given day. Taking a role as a
    team lead somewhere sounds almost paradoxical - the whole goal would be to *not*
    behave as a team lead, which is clearly not how the organization functions or
    they wouldn''t have a role called team lead. I can certainly *imagine* a version
    of a team lead that encourages a healthy culture, but this would run counter to
    the true values of most companies.'

  zh: 第一个问题是，我认为在许多领域里领导角色实际上不应该存在，正如我之前所指出的。领导应该根据正在执行的任务、每个成员的能力以及每天的心理动能（再次阅读：氛围）自然地在团队成员之间流动。在某处担任团队领导听起来几乎是自相矛盾的
    - 整个目标将是*不*表现为团队领导，这显然不符合组织的运作方式，否则他们就不会设立团队领导这个角色。我当然可以*想象*一个鼓励健康文化的团队领导版本，但这与大多数公司的真正价值相抵触。
- en: The second issue is that I think I'd be good at it, which strikes me as a huge
    CAUTION! sign. Everyone knows what I mean, and everyone must also concede that
    this is also a sign of how dire the situation is out in the real world. When I
    tell my teammates that I think I can design a simple application, their first
    thought is (hopefully) not "Wow, he must be about to fucking *bomb* this!". When
    I tell *myself* that I think I could do a decent job managing two juniors, my
    first thought is "I might be a sociopath". The people that consistently rate as
    the most insane authority figures I've seen over the past few years have been
    the ones that said "I'm a natural leader" during the interview process.

  zh: 第二个问题是我认为我做这件事会做得很好，这让我觉得这是一个巨大的警示标志。每个人都知道我是什么意思，每个人也必须承认这也反映了现实世界中局势的严峻性。当我告诉我的队友们我认为我可以设计一个简单的应用程序时，他们的第一个想法（希望如此）不会是“哇，他肯定快要搞砸了！”。当我告诉*自己*我认为我可以好好管理两个初级员工时，我的第一个想法是“我可能是一个反社会者”。在过去几年里，那些一贯被评为最疯狂的权威人物是那些在面试过程中说：“我是一个天生的领导者”。
- en: However, it is also incredibly common for people to remark that those most suited
    for "leadership" roles are those that don't *want* leadership roles. I think that
    protects from the worst excesses of getting a narcissist in charge, but doesn't
    actually consistently produce *great* leadership. I asked Stephen about this,
    and he happily said that he loves leadership roles (and I can confirm that I never
    felt like a subordinate working with him). Simultaneously, one of the most senior
    people in my current reporting chain is a great person that was forced to take
    up leadership despite promises that they wouldn't have to. Haven't seen them in
    months. Great person, lots of respect for them, sadly absolutely useless to me.
    I don't think they'd even disagree with that assessment, they'd just feel guilty.
    So I guess that whole line of thought belongs in the dumpster if you want to pursue
    human flourishing rather than limp sustainably onward.

  zh: 然而，人们也普遍认为最适合“领导”角色的人是那些并不*想要*领导角色的人。我认为这可以防止最坏情况下由一个自恋者掌权，但并不能始终产生*出色*的领导力。我询问了斯蒂芬关于这个问题，他愉快地说他喜欢领导角色（我可以确认和他一起工作从未让我感觉像是下属）。同时，我当前汇报链中的一位最资深人士是一个很棒的人，尽管他们曾被迫接受领导角色，而承诺过不需要。几个月没见到过他们。这是一个很棒的人，我对他们充满尊重，但对我来说却是完全无用的。我觉得他们甚至不会反对这个评估，他们只会感到内疚。所以我想这整个思路如果你想追求人类繁荣而不是单调地持续下去，最好把它丢进垃圾桶。
- en: This is still something I'm mulling over, but I reckon it's best not to force
    it by explicitly looking for a role in the space. It'll happen organically or

    managing rumors, organizational politics, and so on. All the ugliness is baked
    right in. It's probably the perfect book for someone that wants to do a good job

    being high-performing and psychologically comfortable - and that's fine, some
