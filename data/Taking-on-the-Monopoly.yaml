    the road of strategy, they often consider their options in the context of competition.
    Do they want to do what competitors are doing or something different? Do they
    want to be a big fish in a small pond or a small fish in a big pond? Should they
    attempt what others have tried and failed at, or should they take the innovative
    approach?

    nearly all podcast hosting was controlled by entrenched incumbents, all of which

    The audiobooks industry had long been (and in many ways still is) dominated by

    premium audiobooks product](https://www.zaxis.page/p/audiobooks), granting account
    owners access to 150,000 audiobooks as part of their existing premium subscriptions.
    Although I left the company shortly after that launch, I still strongly believe

    of other hungry players and their institutional funders. We’re seeing this play
    out today in AI; we saw it several years ago in crypto; we will see it happen

- en: Monopolies, on the other hand, operate in validated industries by definition.
    They could only have achieved their positions through product-market fit, and
    they can only defend their positions long-term by continually offering user value
    while operating a business with healthy financials. In other words, monopolies
    have already done the hard work of validation for you. And for that reason, they
    have de-risked the upside of taking them on. For instance, in the wake of the
    early podcast boom of 2014 (following the success of the podcast *Serial*), we
    at Anchor saw the surge of creators rushing to create in this new medium on the
    incumbent platforms, and knew precisely which user need we were serving by competing
    in that space.

    The others generated most of their revenue from monthly hosting subscriptions,
    so growing their user base by forgoing this revenue would cannibalize much of
