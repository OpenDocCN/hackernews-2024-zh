    were convinced that Ukraine joining Nato was an existential threat that had to
    be eliminated. Almost every leader on the planet would think that a preventive

    Ukraine was about to join Nato, but it wasn’t, and he seems to find it reasonable

    of Ukraine he has lost his way. In 2012 the author Robert D Kaplan published a
    profile of Mearsheimer in the *Atlantic* titled “Why John J Mearsheimer Is Right
    (About Some Things)”, in which he wrote that the Chicago professor “topples conventional
    foreign-policy shibboleths and provides an unblinking guide to the course the
    United States should follow in the coming decades”. But as he told me over email,
    Kaplan now thinks Mearsheimer “goes too far. Putin’s decision to invade was very
    individualist – much of the Russian elite itself were caught by surprise and shock
    – and so the Russian leader bears the moral blame for the carnage; not the West.”

- en: What darkens Mearsheimer’s realism against the wider tradition is his emphasis
    on tragedy. “The tragedy,” he told me, “is that you could have two states who
    are content with the status quo and have no interest in fighting or competing
    for power. Nevertheless, because they cannot know each other’s intentions, and
    because they operate in an anarchic system, they have to assume the worst about
    each other and have to compete for power. Most people reject the idea that we
    can’t transcend this logic, but what I am saying is that we are condemned forever

- en: Such a stark, minatory world-view, in which powers are trapped in an “iron cage”
    where they must compete for power, is at radical variance with the creeds that
    prevailed in the West after 1989\. Mearsheimer was at the University of Chicago
    when the conservative philosopher Allan Bloom, author of *The Closing of the American
    Mind* (1987), invited Fukuyama to give a talk on the end of the Cold War, during
    which he famously declared the End of History. As he sat in the lecture hall,

- en: He understood, however, why Fukuyama’s assertion of capitalist triumph ended
    up defining both the outlook and objective of US foreign policy. “Most people
    in the West are committed to figuring out how to escape the tragedy of great power
    politics and move into a more peaceful world. That’s why Frank’s [Fukuyama] essay

    democracy. “Embedded in liberalism,” he told me, “is the belief in progress, the

    you can’t do that. International politics is a tragedy – it always has been, it

    If he dislikes the foreign policy elite the feeling towards him is mutual. “I
    never get invited to think tanks or get asked to consult by policymakers. I’m

    power extended to the ends of the Earth, foreign policy elites dispensed with
    the dictates of realism and made liberalism – making the world safe for capital
    – the software that guided US foreign policy. “But,” Mearsheimer explained, “during
    the Cold War we behaved as you would expect from a realist perspective. And since
    the emergence of this new multipolar world in 2017, we have pursued a realist
    strategy, especially towards [China](https://www.newstatesman.com/world/asia/china)

- en: It is a fitting moniker. Machiavelli is often considered as the first realist
    theorist because he denied the relevance of morality in politics. When his guidebook
    for rulers, *The Prince*, was circulated in 1532, five years after Machiavelli’s
    death, his name was condemned across Europe. One English cardinal, Reginald Pole,
    pronounced the Florentine “an enemy of the human race”. The 16th-century scholar
    John Case said that Machiavelli was a defender of tyranny and “one of the major
    threats to the continued peace, stability, and prosperity of the Age of Astrea”.
    In the 20th century, Bertrand Russell called *The Prince*, “a handbook for gangsters”.

    of the most clairvoyant voices in the political science community”. But his views
    on Western foreign policy, and how it has wrought havoc across the world since

    the disturbing force of Mearsheimer’s work may soon have its turn. In years to
    come, in a new age of great power conflict, with Ukraine and Russia perhaps still
    locked in a state of un-peace and the US and China facing off over Taiwan, people
