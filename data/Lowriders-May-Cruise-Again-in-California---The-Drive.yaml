- en: When I was a teenager, [cruising the streets](https://www.thedrive.com/news/my-local-cruise-night-is-the-total-opposite-of-monterey-car-week-and-its-great)
    of northern Indiana was a rite of passage. Cars slowly rolled by as we blasted
    music through open windows and hollered at people we knew (and wanted to meet).
    Then we’d flip around at the end of Main Street to return the other way; rinse
    and repeat.

  zh: 当我还是个十几岁的青少年时，[在印第安纳州北部巡游](https://www.thedrive.com/news/my-local-cruise-night-is-the-total-opposite-of-monterey-car-week-and-its-great)是一种成年礼。汽车缓慢地驶过，我们通过敞开的车窗大声播放音乐，并向我们认识的人（和想认识的人）喊话。然后我们会在主要街道的尽头掉头返回；如此循环往复。
- en: Back in the '80s, cruising was banned in California. On top of that, certain
    modifications were banned and height requirements were put in place. The [lowrider](https://www.thedrive.com/news/31262/lowrider-jeep-gladiator-might-be-the-most-questionably-modified-truck-of-2019)
    community was squarely targeted and cruising went banned until Jan. 1 of this
    year, when the so-called “Cruising Is Not a Crime” bill (Assembly Bill 436) went
    into effect. Lowriders are joyfully finding their way back to local streets again.

  zh: 在80年代，加利福尼亚禁止了巡游。除此之外，某些修改也被禁止，还设置了高度要求。[低底盘](https://www.thedrive.com/news/31262/lowrider-jeep-gladiator-might-be-the-most-questionably-modified-truck-of-2019)社区成为了明显的目标，直到今年1月1日，“巡游不是犯罪”法案（436号议案）生效，巡游才被允许。低底盘车手们正愉快地重返当地街头。
- en: Today, proponents say [lowrider communities](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/travel/vibrant-history-lowrider-car-culture-in-la-180977652/)
    are family-focused. Here in Texas, the Austin Lowriding community headed up a
    toy drive for the east side of town and hosts a big lowrider show and concert
    every fall.

    Assembly Bill 436](https://a80.asmdc.org/press-releases/20230206-assemblymember-alvarez-introduces-legislation-remove-ban-cruising),
    which prohibited targeted rules and regulations for cruising. Alvarez says classic
    cars and cruising are an expression of art and a cultural identity, and safe cruising
    events offer a fun and festive opportunity for communities.

- en: If you haven’t been to a lowrider show, I highly recommend finding one. Some
    families integrate lowrider-themed quinceaneras (the Mexican tradition of celebrating
    a girl’s 15^(th) birthday), weddings, and more with chromed-out, hydraulics-equipped
    cars that spit fire and bounce. Many are hand-painted with stunning, colorful
    designs and the mechanical prowess is on display. Now Californians can cruise
    with their lowriders without fear of reprisal once again.

  zh: 如果你还没有参加过低底盘车展，我强烈建议你去找一个。一些家庭将低底盘主题的十五岁女孩庆生派对（墨西哥传统的庆祝活动）和婚礼与镀铬、装有液压装置的汽车结合在一起，这些车能喷火和弹跳。许多车都是手绘的，具有令人惊叹的、丰富多彩的设计，机械技艺展现无遗。现在加州人可以再次驾驶他们的低底盘车游弋而不必担心报复。
