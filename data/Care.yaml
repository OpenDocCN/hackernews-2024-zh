    that, but we all know how the mind works: writing with nuance and positivity is
    a lot harder than fired-up screeds of the “someone is wrong on the Internet” variety.
    I do try to check myself. I know that people come from all kinds of situations
    and codebases, everyone is doing their best given the conditions they’re in, and
    there really is no One True Way to write code. I will at least always try to give
    a good sense of how I’d prefer things be done instead, rather than just pointing
    at something and saying it’s bad.'

  zh: 我的科技帖子常常带着一种消极的语气。我希望不是这样，但我们都知道头脑的运作方式：以细腻和积极的角度撰写内容比吹毛求疵的互联网争吵形式要困难得多。我确实尝试自我反省。我知道人们来自各种不同的情况与代码库，大家都是在自己所处条件的基础上尽力而为，实际上并不存在所谓写作代码的「唯一正确方式」。至少，我将尝试传达出我希望事项如何处理的偏好，而不是仅仅指出某些事物糟糕。
- en: 'But I think there’s another reason why I come across as negative or angry.
    And as always with these things it’s hard to tell if I’m just jaded and ossified
    from having spent my entire adult life touching keyboards, or if it has real merit:
    I feel like the web used to *work better*. Not in the sense of features or flagship
    sites—web-based email clients and word processors and image editors are all waaay
    better than they used to be and I would say the high-quality stuff is of higher
    quality than ever. I’m not pining for the HTML-only version of GMail, I promise.
    But if I were to estimate some rough median of “how well do websites work” I would
    also say that there’s an *incredible* amount of jank out there. My father called
    me in exasperation last night after trying and failing to book a plane ticket.
    I find myself having to go over to their house and do things like switch browsers,
    open private windows, occasionally even open up the Web Inspector to fiddle with
    the markup, and I hate every second of it. I’ve trained myself out of using the
    Back button and opening things in new windows, and I will often close and restart
    order flows rather than try to go back and edit something I messed up. And I just…
    WHY. Why is it so hard?'

  zh: 但我认为我之所以给人留下负面或愤怒的印象，背后还有一个原因。就这些事而言，令人难以判断是由于多年来一直与键盘打交道所导致的陈旧和固化，还是真正有价值的理由：我觉得网页过去运行得似乎更好。它并不是在特性和旗舰网站意义上的运行得好，像网页版的邮件客户端、文字处理程序和图像编辑器等现在都远超以往，我可以说高质量的功能相较于以往更为出色。我并不是怀旧于仅使用HTML版本的Gmail，我保证。但如果要估算网页工作质量的中位数，这里也会有大量的「杂乱」存在。昨晚，我父亲在尝试并失败预订机票后向我求助。发现自己不得不去他们的房子并进行一些操作，例如切换浏览器、开启私密窗口，有时甚至需要打开网络检查器调整内容布局，我对此感到无比不爽。我已经训练自己不再使用后退按钮和在新窗口中打开东西，我常常会关闭并重新启动流程，而不是尝试回去编辑我在其中犯下的错误。只……为什么会如此困难？
- en: 'Your web browser is an amazing piece of software. Give it an HTML page and
    it’ll render and lay it out in milliseconds, and if you let it do what it wants
    to do (follow a link when it’s clicked, submit a form with a button, populate
    input fields, etc) it’ll just *work like everyone expects it to*. I think that’s
    where most of my pathos comes from: I have a lived experience from the Before
    Times when things were just pages and forms, and it turns out pages and forms
    get you very, very far.'

  zh: 你的网络浏览器是一款了不起的软件。给它一个HTML页面，它的反应速度仅在毫秒级别，如果允许它按照它想要的方式进行工作（点击链接时发起链接，使用按钮提交表单，填充输入框等），它将**恰如其分地**运行。我感到大部分感痛源于经历了过去那种简单页面和表单的时代，事实上，页面和表单可以引导人们实现非常远的目标。
- en: I’m a web developer, so I know that the number one cause of jank and breakage
    is another developer having messed with the browser’s default way of doing things.
    I can usually figure out what has been tampered with and work around it. But normal
    people can’t. They expect the Back button to work, and they expect that the stuff
    they filled out on the previous page will be there when they click it. And it
    would! *If you would just let the browser do what it wants to do!*

  zh: 我是一名网页开发者，我知道造成杂乱和破坏的首要原因往往是另一位开发者更改了浏览器默认的处理方式。我可以通常找出被篡改的内容并找到解决办法。但通常情况下，普通用户无法做到这一步。他们期待后退按钮可以有效工作，并希望点击前一页填写的信息将在点击时重现。如果让他们放手让浏览器按照它想要的方式操作，这一切将会实现！*
- en: 'I could absolutely write cheerier, more charitable and uplifting tech posts.
    Everything doesn’t have to be an aggressive “do better” response to something
    or someone. But I assure you those posts come from a place of genuine concern:
    much of the modern web makes me sad and I feel like I’m screaming into the wind.
    Every broken contact form or booking site is a *truly spectacular* own-goal. If
    your calendar was a bunch of progressively enhanced checkboxes and a submit button,
    you could be riding off into the sunset and counting money instead of taking support
    calls from frustrated octogenarians. And it’s hard for me to shut up about that.'

  zh: 我完全可以写得更加欢快、更加慈善和振奋人心的技术文章。并非所有的东西都必须是对某事或某人激烈的“做得更好”的回应。但我向你保证，这些文章都来自于真正关心的地方：现代网络的许多方面让我感到悲伤，我感觉自己在对着风在大声呼喊。每一个坏掉的联系表格或者预订网站都是一个*极为引人注目的*自摆乌龙。如果你的日历只是一堆逐步增强的复选框和一个提交按钮，你也许早就可以骑着夕阳而去，数着钞票，而不是接受来自沮丧的八旬老人的支持电话。而我很难保持沉默。
