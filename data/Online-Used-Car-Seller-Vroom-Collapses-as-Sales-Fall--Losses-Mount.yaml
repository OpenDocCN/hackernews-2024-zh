- en: It's the age of online shopping, and a few years ago, the race was on to establish
    the [Amazon](https://www.thedrive.com/news/you-can-buy-an-entire-hyundai-on-amazon-starting-in-2024)
    of used cars. Things haven't played out that way though, and [the likes of Carvana
    have been rocked](https://www.thedrive.com/news/it-can-get-worse-for-carvana-and-it-is)
    by the used car market not going their way. Now, major competitor Vroom has officially
    scuttled its online used car sales business, and will liquidate its inventory.

  zh: 这是在线购物的时代，几年前，人们争相建立二手车版的 [亚马逊](https://www.thedrive.com/news/you-can-buy-an-entire-hyundai-on-amazon-starting-in-2024)。然而，事情并没有按照计划进行，[像
    Carvana 这样的公司](https://www.thedrive.com/news/it-can-get-worse-for-carvana-and-it-is)
    遭受了二手车市场不顺利的打击。现在，主要竞争对手 Vroom 正式关闭其在线二手车销售业务，并将清算其库存。
- en: The news was announced both through [Vroom](https://www.vroom.com/sell/sitemsg)'s
    website and a press release seen by [*Automotive News*](https://www.autonews.com/used-cars/used-vehicle-retailer-vroom-halt-operations-sell-inventory).
    Vroom said it's suspending all its online car transactions, both buying and selling,
    and will sell off its existing stock through wholesale outlets. Stating a need
    to save liquidity (in other words, stave off bankruptcy), Vroom will also begin
    layoffs. Its internal finance unit United Auto Credit Corporation will continue
    operating, however.

    的新闻稿公布。Vroom 表示，将暂停所有在线汽车交易，包括购买和销售，并将通过批发渠道出售其现有库存。为了节省流动性（换句话说，避免破产），Vroom 还将开始裁员。但其内部金融部门
    United Auto Credit Corporation 将继续运营。

- en: Vroom's financial situation has rapidly worsened over the last couple years,
    with losses spiraling out of control. *Automotive News* reports that Vroom counted
    only 4,561 online sales in Q3 2023, down 29 percent year-over-year. Profit per
    vehicle fell 25 percent too, to $3,144, contributing to a loss of $82.9 million.
    That's after losing $51.1 million the same quarter in 2022.

  zh: Vroom 的财务状况在过去几年迅速恶化，亏损失控。*汽车新闻* 报道，Vroom 在 2023 年第三季度仅实现 4,561 笔在线销售，同比下降 29%。每辆车的利润也下降了
    25%，至 3,144 美元，导致损失达到 8290 万美元。这是在 2022 年同一季度亏损 5110 万美元之后。
- en: But it's also worth questioning the viability of online used car sales in the
    first place. Selling *new* cars digitally, as Tesla pioneered, makes sense as
    customers know (in theory) the condition and quality of what they're buying. Taking
    the used buying process online however may deny customers knowledge of what they're
    getting, and while no-haggle policies mean convenience, they also hurt the odds
    of getting a deal.

  zh: 但值得质疑的是在线二手车销售的可行性。像特斯拉开创的那样，在线销售 *新车* 是有道理的，因为顾客（理论上）知道他们购买的物品的状况和质量。然而，将二手购买过程搬到线上可能会让顾客对他们购买的东西一无所知，虽然无需讨价还价的政策意味着便利，但也会降低获得优惠的机会。
- en: There's just too much diligence due when it comes to buying a used car, and
    maybe the premium charged for convenience just isn't worth it for used car buyers.
    Perhaps this idea isn't one that'll stick around—we'll have to figure out what
    to do with [those car vending machines though](https://www.thedrive.com/news/21379/carvana-opens-car-vending-machine-in-gaithersburg-maryland).
