- en: One of the biggest provinces in Canada is making the use of [autonomous vehicles](https://www.thedrive.com/category/self-driving-tech)
    illegal on public roads. [British Columbia](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/transportation/driving-and-cycling/road-safety-rules-and-consequences/self-drive)
    has banned self-driving vehicles that exceed an SAE autonomy rating of Level 2,
    which makes the operation of any vehicle with Levels 3, 4, and 5 illegal in the
    interest of public safety. The ban is part of an update to [B.C.'s Motor Vehicle
    Act](https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2024MOTI0046-000476) that went into effect
    on April 5, 2024, after being proposed by legislators in 2023\.

  zh: 加拿大最大的省份之一正在使[自动驾驶车辆](https://www.thedrive.com/category/self-driving-tech)在公共道路上非法化。
    [不列颠哥伦比亚省](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/transportation/driving-and-cycling/road-safety-rules-and-consequences/self-drive)已经禁止超过SAE自主评级为第2级的自动驾驶车辆，这使得任何具有第3、4和5级自动化的车辆的操作在公共安全利益上都是非法的。这项禁令是2024年4月5日生效的[不列颠哥伦比亚省机动车法](https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2024MOTI0046-000476)的一部分，此前于2023年由立法者提出。
- en: The provincial government says this latest update of the "[Motor Vehicle Act](https://www.bclaws.gov.bc.ca/civix/document/id/complete/statreg/96318_00) prohibits
    a person from driving, or permitting the driving of, a Level 3, 4 or 5 automated
    vehicle. This means that highly automated self-driving vehicles cannot yet be
    driven on public roads in B.C., nor can highly automated self-driving features
    be used..." The ban is in effect for now, but that could change as the tech evolves.
    The rules also outline possible consequences for drivers, which will range up
    to a max penalty of $2,000 (CAD) in fines, or just shy of $1,500 at current exchange
    rates. Violators (a person in charge of a "self-driving" car) could also face
    up to six months of prison time.

  zh: 省政府表示，这次对[“机动车法”](https://www.bclaws.gov.bc.ca/civix/document/id/complete/statreg/96318_00)的最新更新禁止任何人驾驶或允许驾驶第3、4或5级自动化车辆。这意味着高度自动化的自动驾驶车辆暂时不能在不列颠哥伦比亚省的公共道路上行驶，也不能使用高度自动化的自动驾驶功能……
    尽管如此，随着技术的发展，这一禁令可能会发生变化。规定还概述了驾驶员可能面临的后果，包括最高达2000加元的罚款或按当前汇率不到1500加元的罚款。违规者（负责“自动驾驶”汽车的人）还可能面临高达六个月的监禁。
- en: These are the highest forms of punishment, however, and penalties for drivers
    begin with milder fines of $368 (CAD), or $266, along with three penalty points
    on their licenses. Points can eventually lead to license suspensions, and of course,
    they have an adverse effect on auto insurance rates. The more points on your license,
    the higher the price of insurance becomes.

  zh: 这些是最严厉的惩罚措施，但对驾驶员的处罚从较轻的368加元罚款开始，或266加元，还有三个驾照积分。积分最终可能导致驾照暂停，并且当然会对汽车保险费率产生不利影响。驾照上的积分越多，保险费就越高。
- en: Cars with autonomous features up to Level 2 remain unaffected by the ban, so
    [Tesla](https://www.thedrive.com/tech/39647/tesla-admits-current-full-self-driving-beta-will-always-be-a-level-2-system-emails)
    owners who use Autopilot and FSD won't have to worry about their insurance premiums
    going sky high—or, at least, not going any higher than they already are. Ford
    and GM vehicle owners with BlueCruise and Super Cruise are also exempt from the
    ban.

  zh: 具有自动驾驶功能直到第2级的汽车不受此禁令影响，因此使用Autopilot和FSD的[特斯拉](https://www.thedrive.com/tech/39647/tesla-admits-current-full-self-driving-beta-will-always-be-a-level-2-system-emails)所有者无需担心他们的保险费率飙升——或者至少不会比现在更高。福特和通用汽车的BlueCruise和Super
    Cruise车主也不受禁令影响。
- en: It's worth noting that banning "highly automated" vehicles, as the British Columbian
    government refers to them, might seem like a dramatic move, but it isn't such
    a sweeping prohibition as it first seems. There are no Level 3 autonomous vehicles
    for sale in Canada at the moment, and Levels 3, 4 and 5 continue to elude most
    automakers. Few cars have achieved these ratings, which do not require human monitoring.
    These include the Mercedes-Benz EQS and S-Class with Drive Pilot, as well as the
    Honda Legend with Honda Sensing Elite. But these cars paired with their specific
    AV tech are available only outside of Canada and are subject to conditional use
    in their respective markets.

  zh: 值得注意的是，禁止“高度自动化”车辆，正如不列颠哥伦比亚政府所称的那样，可能看起来是一个戏剧性的举措，但实际上并不像最初看起来的那样全面禁止。目前加拿大没有出售第三级自动驾驶汽车，且第三级、第四级和第五级自动驾驶技术继续逃避大多数汽车制造商。只有少数车辆达到了这些不需要人类监控的评级，包括梅赛德斯-奔驰EQS和S级配备Drive
    Pilot，以及本田传奇配备Honda Sensing Elite。但是，这些车辆与其特定的自动驾驶技术仅在加拿大以外的市场上可获得，并且受到其各自市场上的条件使用限制。
- en: All of which is to say that Level 3 AVs are exceedingly rare around the world,
    and remain virtually nonexistent in British Columbia. But the decision to ban
    "self-driving" cars could be a preemptive one, and it may prove beneficial for
    B.C. residents who mistrust AVs on public roads. A 2023 study conducted by the
    University of British Columbia's REACT Lab found that the majority of respondents
    are [wary of AVs](https://www.thedrive.com/news/most-americans-wary-of-self-driving-cars-as-trust-in-tesla-wanes-study)
    and agree that regulation is necessary to gradually unleash self-driving cars
    into the wild. This gradual approach seems to be in contrast to that of the U.S.,
    where autonomous vehicles from Waymo and Cruise have wreaked havoc on public roads
    from the Pacific Northwest to southern California.

  zh: 这一切表明，在全球范围内，第三级自动驾驶汽车极为罕见，在不列颠哥伦比亚省几乎不存在。但是，禁止“自动驾驶”汽车的决定可能是一种预防性的举措，并且可能对不信任公共道路上自动驾驶汽车的不列颠哥伦比亚省居民有益。不列颠哥伦比亚大学REACT实验室于2023年进行的一项研究发现，大多数受访者对自动驾驶汽车持谨慎态度，并认为有必要通过逐步监管的方式逐步放开自动驾驶汽车。这种渐进的方法似乎与美国的方法相反，Waymo和Cruise等公司的自动驾驶汽车已在从太平洋西北部到加利福尼亚南部的公共道路上造成混乱。
