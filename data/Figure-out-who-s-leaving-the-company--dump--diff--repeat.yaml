- en: One common element of the larger places where I've worked is that they tend
    to have a directory service of some sort that keeps track of who's an employee
    and who isn't. You can learn some interesting things by periodically dumping that
    list and then running comparisons against the previous dump.

  zh: 我工作过的大公司的一个共同特点是，它们通常有一种目录服务，用来跟踪谁是员工，谁不是。通过定期转储列表，然后与上一次转储进行比较，你可以学到一些有趣的事情。
- en: A certain company had this rolled up into an internal service called "epitaphs"
    where an entry for a person would appear a day or two after they "disappeared
    from LDAP" - meaning, they left the company. Then other people who still worked
    there could add comments like "went back to school", "moved to Idaho to raise
    sheep", that kind of thing.

  zh: 一个公司将这个整合到一个名为"墓志"的内部服务中，当一个人"从LDAP中消失"后，一两天后会出现一个条目，意味着他们离开了公司。然后其他仍在公司工作的人可以添加评论，比如"回学校了"，"搬到爱达荷州养羊"，这类的事情。
- en: 'This had an interesting side-effect that you couldn''t write to your own "epitaph"
    because by definition you had to already be gone from the company for your page
    to exist. Someone else who knew you had to add it. I actually received an e-mail
    to that effect one time: "I''m leaving, so when it shows up, please add XYZ".
    I was pleased that they trusted me to do that, and a few days later, I pasted
    it in as requested.'

  zh: 这带来了一个有趣的副作用，你无法自己写自己的"墓志铭"，因为根据定义，你必须已经离开公司才能有你的页面存在。必须有其他知道你的人来添加。我实际上曾收到过一封电子邮件："我要离开了，所以当它出现时，请添加XYZ。"他们信任我去做这件事，几天后，我按要求粘贴了进去。
- en: Another place I worked didn't have anything quite like this. There was the "internal
    profile" where you could see that so and so worked at the company from <date>
    to <date>, but there wasn't any sort of periodic update available. I decided to
    roll my own. It didn't take much in the way of effort, really. A cron job on my
    dev server (a physical box in a datacenter with access to my home directory) woke
    up a couple of times every day and dumped the entire list to a file. Then it compared
    it to the last one, crunched it down to just the uid (unix account name) field,
    and appended the results to a log file.

  zh: 另一个我工作过的地方并没有类似的东西。有一个"内部档案"，你可以看到某某在公司工作从<date>到<date>，但没有任何周期性更新的机制。我决定自己动手来做这件事。实际上，并没有花费多少精力。在我的开发服务器上（一个物理机器，位于数据中心，可以访问我的主目录），设置了一个定时任务，每天醒来几次，将整个列表转储到一个文件中。然后它会将其与上次的列表进行比较，精简成只有uid（Unix账户名）字段，并将结果追加到日志文件中。
- en: Over time, various other people learned about this, and since I had left it
    world-readable, they were able to leave up a "tail -f <path>" to keep tabs on
    it, and sometimes something surprising would show up during the day. People would
    sometimes just vanish. Other times, there were bizarre things going on that added
    a bit of context.
  id: totrans-split-11

  zh: 随着时间的推移，其他人也了解了这件事，并且因为我把它设置成了全员可读，他们可以通过"tail -f <path>"来持续关注，有时候会出现一些令人惊讶的事情。有些人有时会突然消失。其他时候，发生了一些奇怪的事情，这些事情增加了一些背景信息。

- en: One time, I pasted in a line like that into an IRC channel and that <someone>
    popped up and said "yeah, I don't work here any more". It turned out their account
    had been deactivated, but they still had a client connected. When I mentioned
    their account name, they got a notification, flipped to that window, and replied.
    We had a few minutes to chat about it.

- en: It was weird saying farewell to someone that way. Normally, the electronic lines
    of communication are severed early on. I think what happened here is that the
    IRC servers only checked auth at connect-time, and then nothing went back to make
    sure that sessions remained associated with current employees. (It's a bit of
    a hard problem.)

  zh: 以这种方式向某人告别感觉很奇怪。通常，电子通信的联系早已被切断。我想这里发生的事情是IRC服务器只在连接时检查认证，然后没有任何操作去确保会话仍与当前员工关联。（这是一个有点难的问题。）
- en: Another time, some manager type said they were going to be late for a meeting
    because of some "dumb manager thing" they had to do. Sure enough, a few minutes
    into that meeting, a line scrolled across showing the deactivation of an account
    of one of their direct reports. Obviously, they had to go into one of those HR
    meetings where they showed someone the door.

- en: I'd say the best time to start doing this is when you start at a company, or
    when that company grows big enough to actually have LDAP or whatever. That means

- en: Now, this sort of thing is not perfect. If you don't catch errors, the first
    time it fails to dump and yet diffs a full list against an empty list, it'll look
    like everyone quit. This is not what you want. Also, once you work at a big enough
    company, there WILL be days when some automation will run amok and "fire" everyone,
    [and every account will be deactivated.](/w/2019/11/01/gb/) This will happen more

  zh: 现在，这种事情并不完美。如果你没有发现错误，第一次未能转储并且将完整列表与空列表进行差异比较，看起来就好像每个人都离开了。这不是你想要的结果。此外，一旦你在一个足够大的公司工作，总会有一些自动化失控的时候，“解雇”每个人，[并且每个账户都会被停用。](/w/2019/11/01/gb/)
    如果你在那里待得足够久，这种情况将不止一次发生。
- en: Incidentally, if someone gets mad about you running this sort of thing, you
    probably don't want to work there anyway. On the other hand, if you're able to
    build such tools without IT or similar getting "threatened" by it, then you might
    be somewhere that actually enjoys creating interesting and useful stuff. Treasure
    such places. They don't tend to last.
