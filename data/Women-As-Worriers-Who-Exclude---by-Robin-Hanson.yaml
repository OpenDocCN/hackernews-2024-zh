- en: In *Warriors and Worriers*, psychologist Joyce Benenson presents a new theory
    of sex differences, based on thirty years of research with young children and
    primates around the world. … boys and men deter their enemies, while girls and
    women find assistants to aid them in coping with vulnerable children and elders.
    … Human males form cooperative groups that compete against out-groups, while human
    females exclude other females in their quest to find mates, female family members
    to invest in their children, and keep their own hearts ticking. In the process,
    Benenson turns upside down the familiar wisdom that women are more sociable than
    men and that men are more competitive than women.

    人类男性形成合作组，与外部组竞争，而人类女性则在寻找伴侣、为子女投资的女性家庭成员中排斥其他女性，并保持自己的心脏活动。在这个过程中，贝南森颠覆了关于女性比男性更社交、男性比女性更竞争的熟知智慧。

  zh: 特别有趣的是她讨论了社交排斥在女性行为中的核心地位：
- en: How does a woman compete while minimizing the risk of retaliation? I suggest
    that women use a few simple strategies. Strategy 1 is that a woman does not ever
    let anyone else know that she is competing with them. …  She preaches the mantra
    of equality for all, and sincerely believes it. …Unaware of her own competitive
    instincts, she tries to get as much as she can for herself, while insisting that
    everyone else share equally. If strategy 1 is not working out well enough, then
    a woman may switch to strategy 2, which requires employing social exclusion. She
    must ally with other females to run their target out of town. That way, they retain
    more resources, status, allies, babysitters, and high-quality mates for themselves.
    The virtue of social exclusion is that it allows overt competition but reduces
    the risk of retalitation because the target is outnumbered. Should strategy 2
    fail, the final fallback is strategy 3, which is reserved for emergencies. It
    entails a direct hit on a competitor, a physical or verbal assault. If a woman
    must use strategy 3, she has failed. She is no longer nice; she is mean. … She
    will be abandoned by former allies. Not only that, but she risks retaliation from
    her target. …

  zh: 女性如何在最大限度地减少报复风险的情况下进行竞争？我建议女性使用一些简单的策略。策略1是女性永远不让任何人知道她正在与他们竞争。… 她宣扬平等的口号，并真诚地相信这一点。…
    未意识到自己的竞争本能，她试图尽可能多地为自己争取资源，同时坚持要求每个人平等分享。如果策略1效果不佳，那么女性可能会转向策略2，这需要利用社交排斥。她必须联合其他女性，将她们的目标驱逐出城。这样一来，她们就能保留更多的资源、地位、盟友、保姆和高质量的伴侣给自己。社交排斥的优点在于它允许公开竞争，但由于目标人数不足，减少了报复风险。如果策略2失败，最后的备用方案是策略3，这是为紧急情况而保留的。它涉及对竞争对手的直接打击，即身体或口头攻击。如果一个女性必须使用策略3，那么她已经失败了。她不再友善；她是恶意的。…
    她将被以前的盟友抛弃。不仅如此，她还面临来自目标的报复风险。…
- en: Strategy 2 comes into play when one female stands out. She may stand out because
    she obviously tries to outdo everyone else. She may stand out because she is new,
    extremely talented, or simply has the resources or relationships that others want.
    She may even stand out simply because she is an easy target and has nothing going
    for her. She has no allies. It would cost little to be rid of her, leaving more
    for everyone else. In any of these circumstances, it might be worth using a more
    direct competitive strategy. However, any form of individual, direct competition
    leaves open the possibility of retaliation and potential harm. One way of minimizing
    this is for several girls or women to gang up on a single target. This way, there
    is little chance of any one of the group suffering harm. Social exclusion accomplishes
    just that. …

  zh: 策略2在一个女性突出表现时发挥作用。她可能因为明显试图超越其他人而显眼。她可能因为新人、极具天赋，或者仅仅因为拥有其他人渴望的资源或关系而显眼。她甚至可能因为成为易受攻击的目标而显眼，没有任何支持者。摆脱她所需的代价微乎其微，让更多人受益。在任何这些情况下，使用更直接的竞争策略可能是值得的。然而，任何形式的个体直接竞争都存在被报复和潜在伤害的可能性。减少这种可能性的一种方式是让几个女孩或女性联合起来对付一个单一的目标。这样，整个团体中任何一个人遭受伤害的机会都很小。社交排斥正是达到这一目的的手段。…
