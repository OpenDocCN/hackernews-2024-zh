    a statement that most people would make about metoprolol, or any prescribed medication.

    along with cognitive deficits – “like my brain wouldn’t function,” she recalled.
    Her heart rate, normally in the 60s, now often stayed in the 90s, even while in
    bed. She barely slept at night and lost nearly 50 pounds. By mid-semester, she
    was often unable to work. At around 1 AM one October morning, she was taken to
    the emergency room for a racing heart. When there, she had difficulty responding

    There was something that all of the doctors had noticed, though. Her blood calcium
    levels were often mildly to moderately elevated above normal, up to 11.1 mg/dl
    (normal for her age would be up to 10.2 mg/dl). The cause of this was unclear,

- en: 'Eventually we worked out what happened with Shannon: In 2013 she was diagnosed

    Her Vitamin D was low at the time, so her physician started her on over-the-counter
    Vitamin D supplementation at 5000 international units (IUs) daily. Five years
    later, she was still on this dose, and her blood Vitamin D level had risen to
    79 ng/ml. This level is within what many labs call the normal range, between 30
    and 100 ng/ml, but levels above 70 are almost always a result of high dose supplementation,
    and I have seen toxicity with levels between 70 and 100 ng/ml. (A better “normal
    range” based on what I have seen would probably be between 30 and 60.) Vitamin
    D builds up over time, so the longer someone is on a high dose, the more likely

    ng/ml。这个水平在许多实验室称之为正常范围内，介于30到100 ng/ml之间，但超过70几乎总是高剂量补充的结果，我曾看到70到100 ng/ml之间的中毒症状。根据我看到的情况，一个更好的“正常范围”可能应该在30到60之间。维生素D会随时间累积，因此一个人在高剂量下使用的时间越长，她发生中毒的可能性就越大。Shannon的钙水平在2018年秋天开始上升，她的严重症状也随之发展。**'

    about taking her vitamins, and stopped taking Vitamin D in October. It often takes
