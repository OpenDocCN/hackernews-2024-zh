- en: Selling my company was a milestone that many entrepreneurs dream of. It all
    started with a chip on my shoulder, arrogance that I knew better than everyone
    else, and a laptop, eventually growing into a successful company. In a [previous
    article](https://www.nothingeasyaboutthis.com/lessons-from-selling-a-bootstrapped-company-to-a-pe-backed-company/),
    I shared a bit about the process of selling my company. But today, I get to look
    back on all of that nearly two years later with the benefit of hindsight.

  zh: 出售我的公司是许多企业家梦寐以求的一个里程碑。一切都始于我肩上的一个筹码，我比其他人更了解，以及一台笔记本电脑，最终成长为一家成功的公司。在[之前的文章](https://www.nothingeasyaboutthis.com/lessons-from-selling-a-bootstrapped-company-to-a-pe-backed-company/)中，我分享了一些关于出售我的公司过程的信息。但是今天，我可以以近两年的时间回顾所有这些，并从事后的益处中进行反思。
- en: Most problems in my life come from mis-set expectations. This is also the case
    here. Those not caused by mis-set expectations come from my own laziness and shortsightedness.

    taught myself.

  zh: 背景
- en: My company was a bootstrap success story. From its inception as me consulting,
    to growing the team, to building multiple successful software products, our growth
    was a testament to hard work and determination. I wasn’t smarter, or better connected,
    or better financed, or with a better pedigree than my competitors.  We never took
    outside funding, which meant every decision, every risk, and every triumph was
    solely on me and my wallet. Years of this pressure eventually led me to wanting
    to get away from it all. For some this would be called burnout, but for me it
    was a personal incompatibility with parts of the business I don’t want to delve
    into in this post.

  zh: 我的公司是一个自给自足的成功故事。从我作为顾问的开始，到壮大团队，再到建立多个成功的软件产品，我们的成长是对勤奋和决心的证明。我并不比我的竞争对手更聪明，更有关系网，也没有更好的融资或更好的背景。我们从未接受过外部资金，这意味着每个决定、每个风险和每个胜利都只是我和我的钱包承担的。多年来的这种压力最终让我想要远离这一切。对于一些人来说，这可能被称为倦怠，但对我来说，这是一种个人与业务某些部分不兼容，我不想在这篇文章中深入探讨。

    I hadn''t gone to therapy prior to selling the company. Part of my problem with
    selling comes from the fact I had not identified my values ([https://www.therapistaid.com/therapy-worksheet/values-clarification](https://www.therapistaid.com/therapy-worksheet/values-clarification?ref=nothingeasyaboutthis.com))

- en: I know that these values can be fulfilled through other ways, but for me, the
    agency and autonomy of being the founder also matched my personality and financial
    goals well. It’s hard to know this about yourself if you don’t pause the everyday
    cycle of building and growing to learn more about yourself. Now whenever I talk
    to founders I almost always push them towards getting into therapy not to fix
    any problem, but as a way to force a regular process of reflection and self understanding.

  zh: 我知道这些价值观也可以通过其他方式实现，但对我来说，作为创始人的代理权和自主权也很符合我的个性和财务目标。如果你不停下日常建设和成长的循环来更多地了解自己，你很难知道这一点。现在每当我和创始人交谈时，我几乎总是鼓励他们去接受心理治疗，不是为了解决任何问题，而是作为一种强制性的反思和自我理解的途径。
- en: Another interesting learning was that I care a lot more about cash flows than
    wealth. What you don't know is that when you have a pile of money, you turn into
    a dragon. The goal becomes to sit on the pile of money and make sure it doesn't
    get smaller, and ideally grows on its own. This is surprisingly hard, and amongst
    other wealthy people and former founders I now know, this is one of the most frequent
    preoccupations. In fact, one of the categories people are interested in are cash
    flowing software businesses just like the one I had sold.

  zh: 另一个有趣的经验是，我更关心的是现金流而不是财富。你不知道的是，当你有一大笔钱时，你会变成一只龙。目标是坐在钱堆上，确保它不会变小，最好是自行增长。这其实很难，而且在其他富人和前创始人中，我现在知道，这是最常见的担忧之一。事实上，人们感兴趣的一个类别就是像我曾经卖掉的那样的现金流软件企业。
- en: The best way to think about this is with a trite sports analogy of playing on
    offense vs defense. When I was the founder of a company I was always on offense
    working to grow and expand and find new success. Now I am working to defend what
    I have earned, while struggling with my inability to start something new.
