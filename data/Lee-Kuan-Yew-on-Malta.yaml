- en: Lee Kuan Yew, the founder of modern-day Singapore, visited Malta in 1967 looking
    to assess how the country had faired since the rundown of British forces following
    Malta's independence in 1964\. At the time, the British were also looking to leave
    Singapore and, just like Malta, Singapore's economy was heavily based on British
    military expenditure.

  zh: 现代新加坡的创办者李光耀于1967年访问马耳他，想要评估自1964年马耳他独立以来英国军队撤离后国家的状况。当时，英国也正打算离开新加坡，而且和马耳他一样，新加坡的经济严重依赖于英国的军事支出。
- en: 'Unfortunately, Lee Kuan Yew did not like what he called Maltese “dependency”
    on British aid, as he himself wrote in his autobiography ''[From Third World to
    First](https://bookshop.org/a/22778/9780060197766?ref=karlsnotes.com)'':'

  zh: 不幸的是，李光耀并不喜欢他所称的“对英国援助的依赖”，正如他在自传《[从第三世界到第一世界](https://bookshop.org/a/22778/9780060197766?ref=karlsnotes.com)》中自己所写的：
- en: The loss of British military expenditure between 1968 and 1971 was a blow to
    our economy. It was some 20 percent of our GDP, providing over 30,000 jobs in
    direct employment and another 40,000 in support services. I was determined that
    our attitude to British aid, indeed any aid, should be the opposite of Malta's.
    When I visited Malta in 1967 to see how it had sorted out its problems after the
    rundown of the British forces, I was astounded. The Suez Canal had been closed
    as a result of the Arab Israeli Six-Day War three months earlier, in June. Ships
    were no longer going through the Canal, hence the dockyard in Malta was closed,
    but dockworkers on full pay were playing water polo in the dry dock which they
    had filled with water!

  zh: 在1968年至1971年期间失去了英国军事支出对我们的经济是个打击。它占我们国内生产总值的大约20％，直接提供了3万多个工作岗位以及4万个支持服务岗位。我决心，我们对英国援助，实际上对任何援助的态度，应该与马耳他相反。我于1967年访问马耳他，看看他们在英国军队撤离后如何解决自己的问题，我感到惊讶。苏伊士运河已经在六日战争三个月前，即1967年6月被关闭。船只不再通过苏伊士运河，因此马耳他的船坞被关闭，但船坞工人们却在全薪的情况下在干船坞上打水球！
- en: I was shaken by their aid dependency, banking on continuing charity from the
    British. The British had given fairly generous redundancy payments, including
    five weeks' salary for each year of service, and had also covered the cost of
    three months' retraining in Maltese government institutions. This nurtured a sense
    of dependency, not a spirit of self-reliance.

  zh: 我被他们对援助的依赖所震惊，依赖着英国的持续慈善。英国给出了相当慷慨的裁员补偿金，包括每年服务的五周工资，并支付了三个月在马耳他政府机构内的再培训费用。这滋养了一种依赖感，而不是自力更生的精神。
