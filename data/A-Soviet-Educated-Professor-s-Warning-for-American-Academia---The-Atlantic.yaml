    of a university then named for the Stalin-era propagandist Andrei Zhdanov in the
    city then named Leningrad. Unlike “the ideologically infested humanities, the
    road to mathematics was wide open to all, except to those who had ‘Jew’ written

    a committee that graduate students visited in the order of their GPA. Because
    Barvinok was the first to enter the committee room, all jobs should have been

    wouldn’t have been admitted to the university in the first place and would have
    ended up a conscript in the Soviet Army. The teacher just stared in disbelief,

    good colleague, which was demonstrated by your willingness to do committee work,”

    starting in 1997 to describe the “[broader impacts](https://nsf-gov-resources.nsf.gov/2022-09/Broader_Impacts_0.pdf)”
    of research proposals and how that changed the experience of participating as
    an expert on panels convened to judge grant applications. In a few cases, applicants
    he knew as “excellent mathematicians” and “pretty decent individuals” would describe
    their research objectives with care, knowledge, and enthusiasm, whereas in the
    mandatory “broader impact” section, they would have “nothing better to say than

    students,” something that outraged some members of the panel.

    perhaps well-intended requirement was in fact ill-advised, as it pushed otherwise
    decent people to behave in a silly, sometimes obnoxious manner,” he reflected.

- en: Barvinok has learned to doubt that policies mandated in the name of positive
    social change necessarily result in it. “I am suspicious of an institutional requirement
    to do public good,” he wrote. “As an admirer of Leo Tolstoy, I couldn’t help but
    recall his remark from *War and Peace* that a man, when not overwhelmed by a passion,
    never knows what the public good is, but a man committing a crime always knows
    for sure what it is. The main responsibility of every Soviet citizen was to facilitate
    the arrival of communism, where people would contribute to the society according
    to their abilities and receive from the society according to their needs—has there
    ever been a nobler-sounding goal? And yet historians cannot agree on an estimate
    of how many millions of people were starved to death, tortured to death, or worked
    to death, all in the name of that goal.”

    to do public good, the growth of the academic bureaucracy, and the accusations
    of causing harm to silence opponents—are interrelated. “The more social goals
    one wants to effect, and the more ambitious they are, the more administrators
    one needs, who in turn may put forth new social goals or make the existing ones
    more ambitious,” he explained. “If you are convinced that what you do is in the
    public good, then clearly your opponent is causing harm.” Furthermore, if someone’s
    actions fail to advance progress (as self-styled reformers see it) quickly and
    smoothly, or have the opposite effect, there’s a tendency “to search for the enemies
    within, who hinder the effort, maybe unwittingly.”

    gather my wits, I decided to do some work of my own and went to wash the deck
    of my house.” When he returned, an email to the whole math faculty by a fellow
    professor was in his inbox. The math department’s email, it read, “essentially
    states that the majority of my colleagues are racists, a false accusation which
    I refuse to join.”

    当他回来时，他的收件箱里有一封来自一位同事教授的整个数学系的电子邮件。 邮件中写道，数学系的邮件 "基本上宣称我的大部分同事是种族主义者，这是一个虚假的指控，我拒绝加入。"
- en: Barvinok then responded himself. “I wrote a couple emails to the effect that
    the department has no business making political (or religious, or artistic, or
    gastronomical) statements on behalf of its members, and suggested that those who
    support the statement should just sign it,” he told me. “It became clear then
    that people were afraid to voice their opinion, unless it was aligned with what
    was perceived as the dominant narrative. There were many fewer people who expressed
    their disapproval of the statement publicly than those who did it privately.”

  zh: 然后巴尔维诺克自己回应了。“我写了几封邮件，内容是部门无权代表其成员发表政治（或宗教、艺术或美食）声明，并建议支持该声明的人只需签署它，”他告诉我。“当时清楚地看到，人们害怕表达自己的观点，除非与被认为是主导叙述一致。公开表达对该声明不满的人远远少于私下表达不满的人。”

    and kept their dissenting opinions private. “Across the country, people were indeed
    fired from their jobs for saying things that were deemed harmful, and tenure seemed
    like a flimsy protection,” he recalled. (In *The Canceling of the American Mind*,
    Greg Lukianoff and Rikki Schlott [wrote](https://www.thefp.com/p/american-colleges-gave-birth-to-cancel-culture)
    that in the early aughts, firings of professors were few and far between, but
    that “from just 2014 to mid-2023, we know of more than 1,000 attempts to get professors
    fired, punished, or otherwise silenced,” and that “about two-thirds of these attempts
    are successful, resulting in consequences from investigation to termination.”)

  zh: 尽管巴尔维诺克选择发表意见，但他理解为什么其他人害怕这样做，保持他们持不同意见的私人意见。“在全国范围内，的确有人因为发表被认为有害的言论而被解雇，终身教职似乎是脆弱的保护，”他回忆道。（在《美国思想的取消》一书中，格雷格·卢基亚诺夫和里基·施洛特[写道](https://www.thefp.com/p/american-colleges-gave-birth-to-cancel-culture)，在21世纪初，解雇教授的案例很少，但“从2014年到2023年年中，我们知道有超过1000起试图解雇、惩罚或以其他方式使教授沉默的案例”，“约三分之二的尝试都成功了，导致了从调查到解雇的后果。”）
- en: At the same time, the stakes were never nearly as dire as those in the society
    he’d left. As he put it, “Unlike in the Soviet Union and today’s Russia, it appeared
    that no one was sent to a labor camp, prison, or psychiatric ward. Another big
    difference with the Soviet practices was that to have the support of a few colleagues
    was often enough to stem the tide.”

- en: He argues that, unlike in the Soviet system, dissenters in the U.S. system can
    achieve safety in numbers. “It is one thing to discipline one offender and totally
    another to discipline a whole group,” he explained. “With a group, who will be
    held responsible for allowing the nest of heretics to develop in the first place?
    It looks much more rational just to ignore it. In contrast, the Soviet Union would
    spare no resources to eliminate all offenders and also to give ‘what for’ to their
    relatives, friends, friends of relatives, and relatives of friends. As we know,
    the practice ended badly for the Soviet Union. It is my hope that this crucial
    difference is here to stay.”

  zh: 他认为，与苏联体制不同，美国体制中的持不同意见者可以通过团体安全保障。“惩罚一个违规者和惩罚整个团体完全不同，”他解释道。“对一个团体来说，谁会因为允许异端巢穴的发展而负责呢？忽视它看起来更加合理。相比之下，苏联将不遗余力地消灭所有违规者，还会对他们的亲戚、朋友、亲友的朋友和朋友的亲戚‘痛下杀手’。我们知道，这种做法对苏联不利。我希望这个关键的差异会一直存在。”
- en: A [survey](https://www.thefire.org/research-learn/academic-mind-2022-what-faculty-think-about-free-expression-and-academic-freedom)
    of 1,500 faculty in the U.S. conducted by the Foundation for Individual Rights
    and Expression found that half of respondents considered such statements “an ideological
    litmus test that violates academic freedom.” If Barvinok’s analysis is correct,
    that cohort could speak out against DEI statements without significant risk to
    their career, if only they coordinate and do so in numbers.

    to reform––if hiring processes are biased in favor of a given ideology, and against
    those who dissent from it, the faction benefiting from bias will come to dominate
    the institution over time. As Barvinok put it in his letter to the American Mathematical
    Society, “I anticipate an argument that the AMS is ‘not involved in politics.’
    But this is the kind of ‘politics’ that, rephrasing Pericles, will get involved
    with you, whether you like it or not, and hence inaction is just as political
    as action.”
