    newspapers. He was too practical a 22-year-old to accept a professional baseball

    there were dozens of distinctive local breeds in the United States: White-Laced
    Red Cornish, Mahogany Orloff, Silver-Spangled Hamburg and so on. Such chickens,

    be endemic in migrating birds, which means each fall and spring, as they embark
    on their journeys, they carry the virus, creating a seasonal risk of spillover.
    Typically with chickens, when just one bird in a flock is confirmed to be infected,
    the entire barn is euthanized to halt the spread, often by spraying the birds
    in a foam that causes them to suffocate: millions of birds killed not by the flu

    died in 2007, amid a family financial crisis, his grandson, Blake Evans, decided
    to sell off much of the company. The poultry industry was, as Evans later put
    it, too “high-risk and high-reward.” Chicken is a commodity product, so producers

    to a consumer willing to pay a bit more, so he could break out of the commodity
    rut. Evans had noticed that consumers were more interested in where their food
    was coming from and how animals were treated. So he tried to create a bird that
    could thrive out in a pasture rather than in a CAFO, but that would still be relatively
    cheap to raise and easily shipped to grocery stores. That ruled out the heritage
    breeds, which Evans deemed grew too slowly to compete in the modern economy.'
