- en: Babysitting used to be both a job and a rite of passage. For countless American
    teens, and especially teen girls, it was a tentative step toward adulthood—responsibility,
    but with guardrails. Perhaps you didn’t cook dinner, but you did heat some leftovers
    for the kids. Maybe you arrived to find them already tucked in, and you read them
    a story, turned out the lights, and watched TV until the car turned into the drive.
    You knew whom to call if anything serious came up. Paula Fass, a historian of
    childhood at UC Berkeley, told me that she started sitting around 1960, when she
    was 12 or 13\. By the time she’d arrive, she remembers, the parents had put their
    kids to bed and stocked the fridge for her to raid. They recognized that she was
    grown-up enough to be an extra eye in the home—but childlike enough to go looking
    for snacks.

  zh: 保姆曾经既是一份工作，也是一种成人礼。对无数美国青少年，尤其是少女来说，这是通向成年的试探性步骤——承担责任，但有保护带。也许你不会做晚餐，但你会帮孩子们热些剩饭。也许你到达时他们已经上床了，你会给他们读个故事，关上灯，看到车转进车道。你知道如果有什么重要的事情发生可以找谁。加州大学伯克利分校的儿童历史学家保拉·法斯告诉我，她大约在1960年左右开始当保姆，那时她大约12或13岁。她记得，每次到达时，父母已经把孩子们安顿好，并为她准备了冰箱里的食物。他们意识到她已经足够成熟，可以在家里多一个眼睛——但足够孩子气，会去找零食。

    a Montclair State University sociologist and the author of *[The Cost of Being
    a Girl: Working Teens and the Origins of the Gender Wage Gap](https://bookshop.org/p/books/the-cost-of-being-a-girl-working-teens-and-the-origins-of-the-gender-wage-gap-yasemin-besen-cassino/7731735?ean=9781439913499)*,
    told me. For decades, working a part-time job was common for teens in the U.S.—perhaps
    a reflection of the cultural emphasis on hard work, discipline, and financial
    independence. Even tweens would babysit. And something about that position, teetering
    between dependence and independence, got lodged in our cultural imagination. Starting
    in the mid-20th century, the young sitter became an emblem of American girlhood—both
    a classic coming-of-age character and a locus of anxieties about girls’ growing
    autonomy. Just how mature are these teens? How much control should they have?
    And what kind of adults are they on the cusp of turning into? Those concerns preoccupied
    people not only in real life but also in a plethora of books, shows, and movies.'

    An American History](https://bookshop.org/a/12476/9780814727591)*中写道；例如，祖父母们也享受着他们自己的社交生活。佛斯告诉我，工人阶级家庭可能仍然倾向于让年长的兄弟姐妹来照看年幼的孩子。但中产阶级父母也可以负担得起给街区里的孩子付几美元，这些孩子如今有了想要零花钱的理由——因为公司正越来越多地向青少年市场化产品。这就是青少年看家人的诞生。'

    unmonitored control over your children and your house may naturally have been
    a little worrisome—but beyond that, the sitter took on brewing cultural anxieties.
    Given that she was working outside her own home—and earning her own pay—she represented
    teen girls’ growing autonomy, [according to Forman-Brunell](https://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/ask-an-academic-babysitters-as-bad-girls).
    She was also associated with *women’s* liberation. After all, parents needed her
    partly because moms were starting not only to work but also to enjoy free time
    on the town. (Before the ’20s, Fass told me, “that kind of leisure had not been

  zh: 从一开始，这一角色就受到怀疑的目光。让一个年轻人无人监督地掌管你的孩子和房子，自然会让人有些担忧——但除此之外，看家人还承担了正在酝酿的文化焦虑。考虑到她在自己家外工作——并赚取自己的报酬——她代表了青少年女孩日益增长的自主权利，[据弗曼-布鲁内尔所说](https://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/ask-an-academic-babysitters-as-bad-girls)。她还与*妇女*解放联系在一起。毕竟，父母需要她部分原因是因为母亲们开始不仅工作，而且还享受市镇上的空闲时间。（在20年代之前，佛斯告诉我，“已婚妇女的这种休闲方式并不常见。”）
- en: 'Those domestic worries came through in pop-culture depictions of the sitter.
    In the midst of the 1960s sexual revolution, she was often portrayed as a temptress,
    seducing fathers when mom was away; in the ’70s, she started showing up in horror
    movies, trapped with a killer in the house and kids to protect—perhaps a way,
    Forman-Brunell suggests, to see her punished for her self-sufficiency or for the
    irresponsible behavior audiences seemed to imagine. None of that was likely helping
    sitters’ reputation, but parents still needed them. That’s when *The Baby-Sitters
    Club*, the ’80s book series about a group of tweens running a sitting business—and
    solving mysteries in their spare time—came to the PR rescue. The novels exemplified
    what Forman-Brunell calls the “supersitter” trend, portraying fun but well-behaved,
    competent girls: role models for kids, and also a comfort for nervous parents.

    about ensuring kids’ future *financial* security, using every spare moment to

    families don’t want their kids wasting time sitting in front of the TV or even
    just playing, she told me; they want them learning, say, math or piano or another

    busy with SAT prep or Model UN to be babysitting. Indeed, [teen-labor participation](https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2017/06/disappearance-of-the-summer-job/529824/)
    has been dropping for decades, driven in part by adolescents turning instead to
    academic pursuits and internships. (High-schooler employment rates rose slightly
    after 2020—perhaps partly because employers, strapped while emerging from pandemic
    lockdown, were more [willing to accommodate](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/01/21/teen-jobs-pandemic-wages/#)

    Part-time employment used to be a milestone in many kids’ transition to adulthood.
    But today, the period between childhood and adulthood seems to be longer than
    ever—psychologists call it “extended adolescence.” Americans are getting married,
    having kids, and buying houses at older ages, and spending longer on education
    and career exploration beforehand. So teens don’t just seem unfit for babysitting;

  zh: 特别是考虑到长期以来保姆工作被低估和低薪，让青少年女孩们不得不付出额外努力才能进入这一领域似乎是不公平的。然而，照顾工作是严肃的工作；父母对此加以重视是有道理的。长久以来，它被视为女孩和女性自然而然会做的事情，而不是需要技能并应得公平报酬的劳动。如果我们承认保姆工作不仅仅是一个初级工作，也许成年人来从事这项工作也说得通。
- en: But young people *do* need some opportunities for growth. Rebecca Raby, a professor
    of child and youth studies at Brock University, in Canada, told me that first
    jobs can be extremely formative, even empowering experiences. She’s found that
    many young babysitters have a sense of pride in their craft and their earning
    ability. In the [liminal space](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0907568220953478)
    of early teenhood—a time of feeling awkward, misunderstood, and largely powerless—having
    a job can grant you dignity. And to be a role model for a younger kid might be
    nothing short of profound.

  zh: 但是年轻人确实需要一些成长的机会。加拿大布鲁克大学的儿童与青少年研究教授Rebecca Raby告诉我，第一份工作可能是极具形成性的，甚至是赋予力量感的经历。她发现，许多年轻的保姆对自己的技艺和赚钱能力感到自豪。在早期青少年时期的边缘空间——一段感觉笨拙、被误解和无力的时期——有一份工作可以赋予你尊严。成为年幼孩子的榜样可能无疑是深刻的体验。

    the teens who want to do it—and some people are working toward just that. Margaret
    House, a coordinator for Oregon State University’s community-partnership program,
    runs a babysitting-training program through the youth-leadership organization
    4-H. She teaches teens about child development but also how to impress wary parents:
    the dos and don’ts of being in someone else’s home, different parenting styles,
    how to talk about yourself in interviews. They discuss how this work can lead
    to a real career—working in a day-care center, teaching preschool, researching
    early childhood—and how they might include babysitting on a résumé. Still, she
    doesn’t forget that this work is about creating trust in communities. Sure, it
    takes a village to raise a child, she told me, but “there is no village.” So grown-ups
    have to build it themselves.'

  zh: 理想情况下，社会可以承认照顾工作的重要性，同时支持那些想要从事这项工作的青少年——有些人正在朝着这个方向努力。俄勒冈州立大学社区合作项目协调员Margaret
    House通过青少年领导组织4-H运行一个保姆培训项目。她教青少年关于儿童发展的知识，还教他们如何给警惕的父母留下好印象：在别人家中该做什么和不该做什么，不同的育儿方式，如何在面试中谈论自己。他们讨论这项工作如何可以成为一个真正的职业——在日托中心工作、教授学前班、研究幼儿教育——以及如何在简历中包括保姆经历。然而，她也不忘记这项工作是关于在社区中建立信任。她告诉我，要养育一个孩子需要一个村庄的支持，但“这里没有村庄”。因此成年人必须自己建立起来。
- en: 'House does sometimes have trouble connecting her sitters to parents. Recently,
    she tried to do a meet and greet at the local library, and she remembers that
    only a couple of adults showed up. But she doesn’t doubt that there’s an audience
    out there. She reminds the teens to tell parents about any extra talents they
    have, yes, but she boosts them up regardless: “Parents might want someone who’s
    older and going to be able to teach them multiple languages or whatever.” But
    just by being present and attentive, they’re offering a valuable service. “So
    don’t shortchange yourself,” she tells them.'

  zh: 有时候House确实很难让保姆和家长建立联系。最近，她试图在当地图书馆进行见面会，她记得只有几位成年人出席了。但她不怀疑那里有听众。她提醒青少年告诉父母他们拥有的任何额外才能，是的，但不管怎样她都会鼓励他们：“父母可能想要一个年长并能够教他们多种语言等的人。”但仅仅通过在场和专注，他们就提供了宝贵的服务。“所以不要低估自己，”她告诉他们。
- en: 'Families still need help caring for their kids. Teens still need money, and
    chances to practice responsibility. And neighbors could stand to trust one another
    more—to start building their village. That won’t look just like it did in 1950,
    but that’s for the best. Perhaps we’ll find a way to finally treat adolescents
    as just what they are: not children and not adults, not scary and not superhuman.
    Just young people who, with a bit of support, can be capable of a great deal.'

  zh: 家庭仍然需要帮助照顾他们的孩子。青少年仍然需要钱，还有机会去练习责任感。而邻居之间更需要更多信任彼此的机会——开始建立他们的社区。这不会像1950年那样，但这是最好的。也许我们最终会找到一种方法，把青少年看作他们实际上的样子：不是儿童也不是成年人，既不可怕也不是超人。只是年轻人，通过一点支持，能够做出很多成就。
