  zh: 今天，联邦贸易委员会（[发布了最终规则](/system/files/ftc_gov/pdf/noncompete-rule.pdf)）以促进竞争为目的，在全国范围内禁止非竞争条款，保护工人换工作的基本自由，增加创新，促进新业务的形成。
- en: “Noncompete clauses keep wages low, suppress new ideas, and rob the American
    economy of dynamism, including from the more than 8,500 new startups that would
    be created a year once noncompetes are banned,” said FTC Chair Lina M. Khan. “The
    FTC’s final rule to ban noncompetes will ensure Americans have the freedom to
    pursue a new job, start a new business, or bring a new idea to market.”

  zh: “非竞争条款使工资保持较低水平，抑制新想法，并且从禁止非竞争条款后将创立的8,500多家新创企业中包括的动态性中剥夺了美国经济的活力，”联邦贸易委员会主席莉娜·M·卡恩说道。“联邦贸易委员会禁止非竞争的最终规则将确保美国人民有自由去追求新工作，创业或将新想法推向市场。”
- en: The FTC estimates that the final rule banning noncompetes will lead to new business
    formation growing by 2.7% per year, resulting in more than 8,500 additional new
    businesses created each year. The final rule is expected to result in higher earnings
    for workers, with estimated earnings increasing for the average worker by an additional
    $524 per year, and it is expected to lower health care costs by up to $194 billion
    over the next decade. In addition, the final rule is expected to help drive innovation,
    leading to an estimated average increase of 17,000 to 29,000 more patents each
    year for the next 10 years under the final rule.

- en: Noncompetes are a widespread and often exploitative practice imposing contractual
    conditions that prevent workers from taking a new job or starting a new business.
    Noncompetes often force workers to either stay in a job they want to leave or
    bear other significant harms and costs, such as being forced to switch to a lower-paying
    field, being forced to relocate, being forced to leave the workforce altogether,
    or being forced to defend against expensive litigation. An estimated 30 million
    workers—nearly one in five Americans—are subject to a noncompete.

  zh: 非竞争条款是一种普遍且经常是剥削性的做法，强加合同条件，阻止工人换工作或创业。非竞争条款常常迫使工人要么留在他们想要离开的工作中，要么承受其他重大伤害和成本，比如被迫转向薪酬较低的领域，被迫搬迁，被迫离开劳动力市场，或者被迫应对昂贵的诉讼。据估计，约有3000万工人——近五分之一的美国人——受到非竞争条款的约束。
- en: Under the FTC’s new rule, existing noncompetes for the vast majority of workers
    will no longer be enforceable after the rule’s effective date. Existing noncompetes
    for senior executives - who represent less than 0.75% of workers - can remain
    in force under the FTC’s final rule, but employers are banned from entering into
    or attempting to enforce any new noncompetes, even if they involve senior executives. Employers
    will be required to provide notice to workers other than senior executives who
    are bound by an existing noncompete that they will not be enforcing any noncompetes
    against them.

  zh: 根据联邦贸易委员会的新规定，大多数工人现有的非竞争条款在规定生效日期后将不再具有可执行性。对于占工人人数不到0.75%的高级执行人员，他们现有的非竞争条款可以根据联邦贸易委员会的最终规定继续有效，但雇主被禁止与他们签订或试图执行任何新的非竞争条款，即使涉及到高级执行人员。雇主将被要求通知除高级执行人员外的其他受现有非竞争条款约束的工人，他们不会对他们执行任何非竞争条款。

    which was subject to a 90-day public comment period. The FTC received more than
    26,000 comments on the proposed rule, with over 25,000 comments in support of
    the FTC’s proposed ban on noncompetes. The comments informed the FTC’s final rulemaking
    process, with the FTC carefully reviewing each comment and making changes to the
    proposed rule in response to the public’s feedback.

- en: In the final rule, the Commission has determined that it is an unfair method
    of competition, and therefore a violation of Section 5 of the FTC Act, for employers
    to enter into noncompetes with workers and to enforce certain noncompetes.

  zh: 在最终规则中，委员会已确定，对雇主与工人签订非竞争协议并执行某些非竞争协议构成不公平的竞争手段，并且违反了FTC法案第5条的规定。
- en: The Commission found that noncompetes tend to negatively affect competitive
    conditions in labor markets by inhibiting efficient matching between workers and
    employers. The Commission also found that noncompetes tend to negatively affect
    competitive conditions in product and service markets, inhibiting new business
    formation and innovation. There is also evidence that noncompetes lead to increased
    market concentration and higher prices for consumers.

  zh: 委员会发现，非竞争条款往往会通过抑制工人与雇主之间的有效匹配而对劳动力市场的竞争条件产生负面影响。委员会还发现，非竞争条款往往会对产品和服务市场的竞争条件产生负面影响，抑制新业务的形成和创新。还有证据表明，非竞争条款导致市场集中度增加，并且导致消费者价格上涨。

    to workers bound to an existing noncompete that the noncompete agreement will
    not be enforced against them in the future. To aid employers’ compliance with
