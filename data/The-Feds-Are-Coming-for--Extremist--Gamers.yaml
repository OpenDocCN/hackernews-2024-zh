    the companies can use these meetings to “share information with I&A [DHS’s intelligence
    office] about online activities promoting domestic violent extremism,” or even
    simply “activities that violate the companies’ terms of service.” Through its
    56 field offices and hundreds of resident agencies subordinate field offices,
    the FBI receives tips from gaming companies of potential law-breaking and extremist
    views for further investigation. The FBI also conducts briefings to gaming companies
