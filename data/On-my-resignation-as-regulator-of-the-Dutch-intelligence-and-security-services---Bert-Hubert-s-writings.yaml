- en: Until today I was one of the three members of the board that checks warrants
    for the Dutch intelligence and security services. This board is called “[Toetsingscommissie
    Inzet Bevoegdheden](https://tib-ivd.nl/)” or TIB.

  zh: 直到今天，我是荷兰情报和安全服务的三名委员会成员之一，负责审核授权书。这个委员会叫做“[Toetsingscommissie Inzet Bevoegdheden](https://tib-ivd.nl/)”，简称TIB。
- en: If either of the civil or the military intelligence and security services of
    The Netherlands want to use their lawful intercept, SIGINT or hacking (& some
    other) legal powers, they have to first convince their own jurists, then their
    ministry and finally the TIB. The TIB then [studies if the warrant is legal](https://english.aivd.nl/about-aivd/the-intelligence-and-security-services-act-2017/regulatory-commission),
    and that decision is binding.

  zh: 如果荷兰的民用或军事情报和安全机构想要使用其合法的拦截、信号情报或黑客（及其他一些）法定权力，他们必须首先说服自己的法律专家，然后是他们的部门，最后是TIB。然后，TIB会
    [研究授权是否合法](https://english.aivd.nl/about-aivd/the-intelligence-and-security-services-act-2017/regulatory-commission)，并且该决定具有约束力。
- en: To further international transparency, the TIB [also publishes its annual report
    in English](https://www.tib-ivd.nl/binaries/tib/documenten/jaarverslagen/2022/05/24/annual-report-tib-2021/Annual+Report+TIB+2021.pdf).

- en: When I joined the regulatory commission, I was very happy to find that the Dutch
    intelligence and security services were doing precisely the kinds of things you’d
    expect such services to do. I also found that our regulatory mechanisms worked
    as intended - if anything was found to be amiss, the services would actually stop
    doing that. If the ex-ante regulator (ie, my board) ruled a permission to do something
    was unlawful, it would indeed not happen. I think it is important to affirm this
    in public.

  zh: 当我加入监管委员会时，我非常高兴地发现荷兰情报和安全服务确实在做你所期望的这类服务应该做的事情。我还发现我们的监管机制正常运作 - 如果发现有任何问题，这些服务实际上会停止这样做。如果事前监管者（即，我的委员会）裁定做某事的许可是非法的，那么它确实不会发生。我认为在公开场合肯定这一点很重要。
- en: Over the past two years however there have been several attempts to change or
    amend the Dutch intelligence law ([English language translation](https://english.aivd.nl/about-aivd/the-intelligence-and-security-services-act-2017)).

  zh: 最近的尝试已经克服了几个立法障碍，看起来将被议会通过。
- en: Under this new law, my specific role (technical risk analysis) would mostly
    be eliminated. In addition, the Dutch SIGINT (bulk interception) powers would
    be stripped of a lot of regulatory requirements. Furthermore, there are new powers,
    like using algorithmic analysis on bulk intercepted data, without a requirement
    to get external approval. Finally, significant parts of the oversight would move
    from up front (’ex ante’) to ongoing or afterwards (’ex post’).

  zh: 在这项新法律下，我的具体角色（技术风险分析）将被大多数取消。此外，荷兰的信号情报（大规模拦截）权限将被剥夺许多监管要求。此外，还有一些新的权力，比如在大规模拦截的数据上使用算法分析，而无需获得外部批准。最后，监督的重要部分将从事前（“事前”）移动到进行中或事后（“事后”）。
- en: Doing upfront authorization of powers is relatively efficient, and is also pleasingly
    self regulating. If an agency overloads or confuses its ex ante regulator, they
    simply won’t get permission to do things. This provides a strong incentive for
    clear and concise requests to the regulator.

  zh: 提前授权权力相对高效，并且也是令人愉悦的自我调节。如果一个机构过载或混淆了其事前监管者，他们根本就不会获得做事的许可。这为向监管者提出清晰简洁的请求提供了强大的激励。
- en: A regulator that has to investigate ongoing affairs however is in a different
    position. It can easily become overloaded, especially if it is unable to recruit
    sufficient (technical) experts. In the current labor market, it is unlikely that
    a regulator will be able to swiftly recruit sufficient numbers of highly skilled
    computer experts able to do ongoing investigations of sophisticated hacking campaigns
    and bulk interception projects. An overloaded regulator does not provide good
    coverage. It is also vulnerable to [starve the beast tactics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starve_the_beast).
