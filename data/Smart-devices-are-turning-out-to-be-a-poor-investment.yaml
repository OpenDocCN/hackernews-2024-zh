    The premium streamer was marketed as a utopia for streaming online and offline
    sources with the ability to plug in hard drives, connect to NAS drives, and more.

    was otherwise a clean and elegant solution [to an ad-infested overlay that I zoom

    running Chromecast has a home screen that’s more of an advertising space for Google
    than an easy way to get to my content. My television running Google TV makes for
    a situation that is even more egregious. A $1500 television that behaves like
    a 75” billboard. I’m not unaware of the strategy to subsidize hardware through
    ads, but these are not subsidized devices. In the case of the Shield, I paid close
    to $200 for the privilege of a premium experience. And, unlike, say, a Kindle,
    where buyers can pay to remove ads, I was given no choice in the decision to ruin
    my entertainment experience.

    Nest Hubs and outfitted them in most of my rooms and washrooms. However, Google's
    consistent degradation of the user experience means I use these speakers for little
    more than casting music from the Spotify app. The voice recognition barely works
    on the best of days, and when it does, the answers tend to be wildly inconsistent.
    It wasn't always the case. In fact, at launch, Google's Nest speakers were some
    of the best smart home interfaces you could buy. You'd imagine that the experience
    would only improve from there. That's decidedly not the case. I had high hopes
    that the Fuchsia update would fix the broken command detection, but that's also
