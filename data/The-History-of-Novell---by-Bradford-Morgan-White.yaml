    1980 (though possibly informally in 1979 in Provo) with $2 million (around $7.5
    million in 2024) in funding from Safeguard Scientific. Crucially, Safeguard owned
    a controlling portion of NDSI as part of this funding deal. Canova was the the
    company’s first president while Davis was in charge of sales and marketing, and
    Warren Van Dyke Musser (Pete) of Safeguard was chairman. Their first building
    had previously been a truck dealership, and the company’s mission was to make
    computers and printers. Their first products were [Zilog](https://www.abortretry.fail/p/the-last-word-in-integrated-logic)
    Z-80 machines with 64K RAM and printers capable of around one hundred sixty characters
    per second. The company quickly grew to around one hundred twenty employees and
    created a few products that never went on sale but certainly cost money to design
    and prototype. From what I’ve been able to find, the only products from NDSI before
    1983 were the Nexus microcomputer series and the Image 800 printer series.

    BYU and received his Bachelor of Science from the university in 1980\. Along with
    Dale Neibaur and Kyle Powell, he founded SuperSet Software in Provo (essentially,
    just drive south on State St from Orem, which is south from Salt Lake City on
    I-15). SuperSet’s primary goal was to further develop and then to market networking
    technology that the three former classmates had worked on while attending BYU
    and the Eyring Research Institute. All of these technologies and the gentlemen’s
    research work had been for ARPANET projects, and most of these technologies were
    originally derivative works of Xerox’s XNS protocol but over time these became
    both the IPX (internetwork packet exchange) and SPX (sequenced packet exchange)
    protocols.

- en: 'In 1981, Novell was on hard times. They simply didn’t sell much equipment and
    they’d burned quite a bit of cash. As a general rule, investors like to make returns
    and they dislike losses. The company needed *something* to set their machines
    apart and drive sales. Someone thought it would be good to lean into networking.
    Accordingly, Novell hired SuperSet as consultants to help them develop that capability.
    This was an extremely good idea, as not long after, Safeguard sent Jack Messman
    to determine whether or not Novell was worth saving and serve as the company’s
    president for a time. He arrived to find Major, Neibaur, and Powell playing a
    game they’d written called Snipes. Normally, this wouldn’t be a good thing, but
    in this case, it was a great thing. The three men were on different computers
    (TRS-80, Commodore PET, Apple II), but they were playing together over a network.
    Messman reported back: “*You know, Pete, they''ve got something pretty interesting
    that they can do here with this networking.*” According to Musser, it was that
    single visit that kept Novell alive, but Davis first and then later Canova were
    fired. Through 1982 the company had no less than six different presidents, and
    the company was mired in chaos. While there was quite a bit of turn over in leadership,
    the company also laid off nearly all of its staff reducing head count to just
    fifteen.'

    PET、Apple II），但他们通过网络一起玩游戏。梅斯曼回报说：“*你知道，皮特，他们可以通过这种网络做一些非常有趣的事情*。”据穆瑟称，正是这一次访问使Novell得以存活下来，但戴维斯首先，后来是卡诺瓦被解雇。1982年期间，该公司至少更换了六位不同的总裁，陷入混乱中。尽管领导层频繁更替，公司也几乎解雇了所有员工，将员工人数减少到仅15人。
- en: While Canova and Davis got zero credit for it, bringing network expertise into
    the company allowed the company to demonstrate real network capabilities at the
    November COMDEX of 1982 and to attract quite a bit of attention. One person in
    particular who was attracted by this networking capability was Ray Noorda. Messman
    met him at COMDEX and from what I understand Jack Davis had previously recommended
    him to Safeguard/Novell as a potential candidate to lead the company. According
    to Musser, Noorda wasn’t one who was generally excitable, he wasn’t fond of many
    people, and he was a rather hard man. He was known for being a no-nonsense kind
    of person who could turn a company around and save it.

    board and he represented Safeguard’s interests. Noorda and his remaining fifteen
    employees promptly set about completely changing the focus of the company. Novell
    would now focus on software and not hardware, and Noorda made this non-optional

    and he borrowed another $1.3 million (around $4 million in 2024). For this, he
    gained a personal stake in the company of thirty three percent. He had tied his
    fortunes to Novell, and he was determined to win. The visionary idea he had was
    to take Major’s earlier disk and printer sharing network technologies and make
    it possible to do file sharing instead. Why lock a whole disk if you a person
    only requires a single file? This was Novell NetWare 1.0 that allowed users of
    the first true network operating system to access files on a server as if they
    were local. NetWare had a true dedicated server architecture, a specific and dedicated
    machine was the server and managed resources and services for clients. In a true
    stroke of genius, Novell thought about security from day one. Networks were still
    somewhat new in 1983, and most people hadn’t even begun to consider the security
    implications of the technology, but NetWare had both user authentication and access
    controls. Finally, while NetWare was initially IPX/SPX only, it was designed in
    such a way that it would be adaptable. Whatever the network topology was, NetWare
    would be there.

    NetWare 1.0的理念，让第一个真正的网络操作系统的用户可以像访问本地文件一样访问服务器上的文件。NetWare具有真正的专用服务器架构，一个特定的、专用的机器充当服务器，管理客户端的资源和服务。Novell的一个真正的天才之举是从一开始就考虑了安全性。1983年，网络仍然比较新颖，大多数人甚至还没有开始考虑技术的安全性影响，但NetWare既有用户认证又有访问控制。最后，虽然最初NetWare仅支持IPX/SPX，但它设计得具有高度适应性。无论网络拓扑如何，NetWare都可以应对。
- en: The timing of NetWare was truly remarkable. In 1983, hard disks were really
    just starting to penetrate the market with the PC XT having been released on the
    8th of March of that year. NetWare was there for the office that was wealthy enough
    to own both a hard disk or two and some networking equipment. The first version
    supported both PC-DOS and CP/M clients. The server hardware, however, was initially
    required to be a Motorola 68000 (NetWare 68) but this changed very quickly following
    the release of the XT. NetWare was ported to the Intel 8088/8086 (NetWare 86),
    and it began to gain support for a very wide variety of expansion cards. These
    were followed by Advanced NetWare 1.0 in 1985 which allowed for more than one
    server on any given network. Later that year (or early in 1986), Advanced NetWare
    1.2 was released with limited support for the 286 and its various features and

    68000（NetWare 68），但随着XT的发布，情况很快发生了变化。NetWare被移植到Intel 8088/8086（NetWare 86），并开始支持各种各样的扩展卡。这些之后，1985年发布了Advanced
    NetWare 1.0，允许在任何给定网络上有多台服务器。同年晚些时候（或1986年初），发布了带有对286及其各种特性和改进的有限支持的Advanced
    NetWare 1.2。
- en: NetWare 2.0 for the Motorola 68000 was released in December of 1985, for the
    8088/8086 in January of 1986, and for the 80286 in December of 1986\. NetWare
    2.0 for the 286 allowed for protected mode operation, use of 16MB of RAM, better
    multitasking, larger volume size limits, and RAM disk caches for frequently accessed
    files. All of this taken together increased performance significantly which made
    larger networks more feasible. NetWare 2 supported more hardware from its first
    day on the market, and it supported all major network configurations of the day
    (ARCNET, Token Ring, Ethernet). What’s more, NetWare 2 also supported Loadable
    Modules (NLMs). This feature allowed both Novell and third parties to release
    add-on software with new capabilities such as database servers, backup solutions,
    anti-virus programs, mail, groupware suites, and much more. Third parties had
    been making add-on products for NetWare as early as April of 1983, but NetWare
    Loadable Modules brought standards and an official status to the various services

- en: 'NetWare 2 for 286 improved on other versions in another way that allowed Novell
    to position its network solution as an alternative to minicomputers and mainframes:
    fault tolerance. This included things like read-after-write verification, bad-block
    remapping done during the course of normal operation, software RAID, transaction
    tracking (so an incomplete write could be reversed), and support for up to four
    network cards in concurrent use. A standard license for NetWare was for one hundred
    clients. From what I can find, most Novell customers at this time bought pre-assembled
    and purpose built servers when going for that standard license. The cost was then
    determined based upon the hardware and client count with typical pricing ranging
    from $4500 to $12000\. If one were to purchase NetWare only, the pricing was around
    $2000 (roughly $5600 in 2024) depending upon precisely which version, client count,
    and feature set was desired. This price could go up to $4995 (around $14000 in
    2024) if a company wished for every feature. For the price conscious, any random
    286-based machine could run the server with an introductory price for four concurrent
    users of $595 (this was referred to as ELS NetWare [ELS stands for Entry Level
    Solution], cost around $1700 in 2024). This entry level system could later be
    upgraded to ELS II with support for eight concurrent users at a discounted price,
    though I haven’t found what that price was as most ads advise purchasers to call
    the software vendor. With the full NetWare 2 286 release, a dedicated server could
    serve bootable disk images for clients as long as those clients’ boot ROMs or
    BIOS had NetWare network boot capabilities, but the ELS versions of NetWare lacked
    this ability.'

    RAID、事务跟踪（因此未完成的写操作可以被撤销）以及支持同时使用多达四个网络卡。NetWare 的标准许可证适用于一百个客户端。根据我找到的信息，大多数
    Novell 客户在这个时期购买预装并专门构建的服务器以获取标准许可证。费用基于硬件和客户端数量确定，典型的定价范围从 $4500 到 $12000。如果只购买
    NetWare，则价格约为 $2000（大约相当于 2024 年的 $5600），具体取决于所需的版本、客户端数量和功能集。如果公司希望拥有所有功能，则价格可能高达
    $4995（大约相当于 2024 年的 $14000）。对于注重价格的客户，任何一台随机的基于 286 的机器都可以运行服务器，四个并发用户的入门价格为 $595（称为
    ELS NetWare，ELS 表示入门级解决方案，2024 年约为 $1700）。这种入门级系统可以以折扣价格升级为支持八个并发用户的 ELS II，尽管我没有找到具体的价格，因为大多数广告建议购买者致电软件供应商。通过完整的
    NetWare 2 286 版本，专用服务器可以为客户端提供可引导的磁盘映像，只要这些客户端的引导 ROM 或 BIOS 具有 NetWare 网络引导功能，但
    NetWare 的 ELS 版本缺乏此功能。
- en: In 1987, Novell re-entered the hardware market albeit in a rather modest way.
    The company felt that a primary issue in driving NetWare adoption was the dearth
    of affordable network hardware. Their answer, released in February, was the NE1000\.
    This was an 8 bit card based off of the National Semiconductor 8390\. The first
    versions were branded as the *E-Net adapter* and priced at just $395 (around $1000
    in 2024) while many competitors’ products were closer to $600\. A 16 bit card,
    the NE2000, was released in 1988 at a price of $495 (about $1300 in 2024). Both
    cards were designed using off-the-shelf components and manufactured by Eagle (an
    arm of Anthem Technologies). Novell’s distributors would actually order and purchase
    these cards directly from Eagle and not from Novell. Novell simply received a
    royalty for their design work. The company also permitted other companies to clone
    their designs. For Novell, more network cards meant a larger potential market
    for network software, and that was a market in which their influence was very
    swiftly rising. The NE1000 and NE2000 were wildly successful selling at nearly
    twenty thousand per month. The cards’ status as a top seller was further cemented
    in 1989 when the prices were lowered to $295 (about $738 in 2024) for the NE1000
    and $345 (around $863 in 2024) for the NE2000.

    Semiconductor 8390的8位卡。最初版本被品牌化为*E-Net适配器*，价格仅为395美元（2024年约为1000美元），而许多竞争对手的产品接近600美元。1988年推出了16位卡NE2000，售价495美元（2024年约为1300美元）。这两款卡都采用现成的组件设计，并由Anthem
    Technologies旗下的Eagle公司制造。Novell的经销商实际上是直接从Eagle而不是Novell购买这些卡。Novell仅对其设计工作收取版税。该公司还允许其他公司克隆他们的设计。对Novell来说，更多的网络卡意味着更大的网络软件潜在市场，而这是他们影响力迅速上升的市场。NE1000和NE2000的销售非常成功，每月销售近两万张。1989年，NE1000的价格降至295美元（2024年约为738美元），NE2000降至345美元（2024年约为863美元），进一步巩固了这两款卡的畅销地位。

    1987, Novell purchased CXI. CXI specialized in making equipment and software that
    allowed the integration of IBM PCs and compatibles into networks of IBM mainframes
    and terminals. This acquisition involved a stock swap valued at around $34 million
    (around $93 million in 2024) and made CXI a wholly owned subsidiary of Novell.
    In October of that same year, CXI introduced an IBM PS/2 add-in board that would
    connect PS/2s to both IBM mainframes and NetWare LANs. The board cost $545 (around
    $1489 in 2024) and came with software to enable all of the various functionality

    primary product was called Btrieve, a transactional database program. It was pretty
    neat. The early versions for PC-DOS ran as a TSR providing an API to the database
    engine. Later versions featured network access capabilities and multi-user functionality
    and record locking. This wasn’t a cheap product priced at nearly $1000 (about
    $3000 in 2024) but applications built using Btrieve’s TSR could be distributed

    better support for both Macintosh and UNIX clients, supporting far larger disks,
    much more memory, and it cached the entire file allocation table in memory greatly
    which increased performance. NetWare 3.0 did not, however, have preemptive multitasking,

    did little to improve upon NetWare’s reliability which wasn’t bad by the standards
    of the day, but not exactly amazing either. Performance was simply deemed more
    important at the time. Yet, while the system itself may not have been more reliable,
    version 3’s network communications certainly were. Version 3 saw the introduction
    of the NetWare Core Protocol which was an overhaul of the IPX/SPX implementation
    that brought uniformity to the way file, print, and other services were handled.
    With NCP, Novell brought better authentication as well as stronger encryption
    to the product. This version also saw Novell introduce the NetWare Link Services
    Protocol which was an improved routing protocol that allowed for more efficient
    scaling and thus much larger networks. NetWare 3.0 was still configured and administered
    using text-based utilities and lacked a graphical user interface.

    语言 API 和适用于 NetWare 可加载模块的库集，支持更大的磁盘、更多的内存，并且大大地提高了性能，将整个文件分配表缓存到内存中。然而，NetWare
    3.0 并没有抢占式多任务处理，所有 NLM 运行在 ring 0。由于这两个缺点，NetWare 3.0 在提高可靠性方面帮助不大，虽然按当时的标准来说可靠性还不错，但并不算是令人惊叹的。当时的性能显然更为重要。尽管系统本身可能并不更可靠，但第
    3 版的网络通信确实是。第 3 版引入了 NetWare 核心协议，这是 IPX/SPX 实现的全面改进，统一了文件、打印和其他服务的处理方式。通过 NCP，Novell
    还为产品带来了更好的认证和更强的加密。这个版本还看到 Novell 推出了 NetWare 链路服务协议，这是一个改进的路由协议，允许更高效的扩展，因此支持更大的网络。NetWare
    3.0 仍然使用基于文本的实用工具进行配置和管理，缺乏图形用户界面。

- en: On the 12th of December in 1991, Novell announced a joint venture with AT&T
    named Univel, headquartered in San Jose, that aimed to develop the Destiny desktop
    UNIX operating system. Novell held the controlling share in the venture with fifty
    five percent, and the bulk of the engineering efforts took place in Sandy, Utah.
    The basis for this system was UNIX SVR4.2 with the MoOLIT toolkit providing the
    looks of either OPEN LOOK or MOTIF depending upon the user’s preferences. This
    system made use of virtual filesystems as a descendent of SVR4, and it allowed
    support for VxFS or UFS as root, featured both TCP/IP and IPX networking, and
    it had DOS compatibility via DOS Merge 3 (essentially VDMs) and DR-DOS 6\. This
    system became known as UnixWare upon its release in 1992\. From articles of the
    time period, Novell made the assumption that UnixWare’s desktop release would
    only ever require NetWare, and their *Portable NetWare* packages for UNIX became
    *NetWare for UNIX* although overhauled for this first party effort. The Advanced
    Server edition of UnixWare is the release that featured IPX, SPX, and TCP/IP.
    The other notable difference between the two was that the desktop release only
    supported two concurrent users while the Advanced Server had no limit. Despite
    lowering its prices in April of 1993, Univel couldn’t move units. On the 21st
    of December in 1992, Novell announced its intentions to acquire USL including
    all of the UNIX copyrights, trademarks, and licensing contracts. This was completed
    by June of 1993\. USL was folded into the Novell UNIX Systems Group and moved
    to Utah. Shortly after the acquisition, Joel Appelbaum, former Univel President
    & CEO, and Roel Pieper, former CEO of USL, resigned. UnixWare 1.1 was released
    in December of 1993.

  zh: 1991年12月12日，Novell宣布与AT&T成立联合企业Univel，总部设在圣何塞，旨在开发名为Destiny的桌面UNIX操作系统。Novell在该合资企业中持有55%的控股权，大部分工程工作在犹他州桑迪进行。该系统的基础是UNIX
    SVR4.2，使用MoOLIT工具包，可根据用户喜好提供OPEN LOOK或MOTIF的外观。该系统作为SVR4的后代，使用虚拟文件系统，支持VxFS或UFS作为根文件系统，同时支持TCP/IP和IPX网络，通过DOS
    Merge 3实现DOS兼容性（本质上是VDMs）和DR-DOS 6。该系统在1992年发布时被称为UnixWare。根据当时的文章，Novell认为UnixWare的桌面版本只需NetWare即可，并为UNIX推出了*Portable
    NetWare*套装，尽管这是首次的全新努力。UnixWare的高级服务器版包含IPX、SPX和TCP/IP。两者之间的另一个显著区别是，桌面版只支持两个并发用户，而高级服务器则没有限制。尽管在1993年4月降低了价格，Univel仍无法推动销量。1992年12月21日，Novell宣布其收购USL的意图，包括所有UNIX版权、商标和许可合同。此项交易于1993年6月完成。USL被整合到Novell
    UNIX Systems Group并迁至犹他州。收购完成后不久，前Univel总裁兼首席执行官Joel Appelbaum和前USL首席执行官Roel Pieper辞职。UnixWare

- en: To compete with Microsoft Windows 3, Novell intended to add rich networking
    capabilities to a multitasking version of DR-DOS and then use GEM as a graphical
    environment. Don’t think of this as DOS though. After booting into the 16 bit
    DR-DOS environment with which many of us are familiar, the system loaded Vladivar,
    a 32 bit preemptively multitasking, multithreaded, operating system kernel featuring
    hardware virtualization, scheduling, dynamically loadable device drivers, and
    namespaces. This software was previously used for isolated virtual DOS machines,
    but was modified and repurposed to be a more general OS kernel. However, the possibility
    of legal action from Apple over GEM’s look and feel presented a problem. Accordingly,
    Novell’s head of marketing, Darrell Miller, reached out to Apple’s CEO, John Sculley,
    about porting System 7 to the 486\. Sculley agreed, and on the 14th of February
    in 1992, project Star Trek began with a scheduled prototype completion date set
    for the 31st of October. Yeah… about that… classic MacOS was largely written in
    Motorola 68k assembly language. The newer Pascal bits were certainly easier to
    port, but the 68k and the 486 are very different CPUs. Additionally, the Macintosh
    was heavily reliant on ROMs. This porting effort would be a rather Herculean task.
    Ultimately, the ROMs were implemented as software that would run on Valdivar,
    many of the assembly language bits were rewritten in a higher level language,
    and a functional prototype was indeed delivered but a bit late, the 1st of December.
    They did overshoot the goal though. The prototype had working QuickDraw GX and
    QuickTime. Despite delivering the working product, the project was cancelled at
    Apple when Michael Spindler took over as CEO. Novell then released the updated
    DOS environment without Apple’s bits and bytes as Novell DOS 7 with TASKMGR providing
    the multitasking controls and also providing an API for GUIs to leverage within
    EMM386\. Unrelated to our main topic, some of Apple’s code rewriting helped in
    the transition to PowerPC and the file-based ROMs were later used in the iMac.

    7移植到486上。斯卡利同意了，并且于1992年2月14日开始了Star Trek项目，并定于10月31日完成原型。关于这个……经典的MacOS主要是用Motorola
    68k汇编语言编写的。新的Pascal位相对来说更容易移植，但68k和486是非常不同的CPU。此外，Macintosh严重依赖ROM。这个移植工作将是一个相当艰巨的任务。最终，ROM被实现为可以在Valdivar上运行的软件，许多汇编语言位被改写为更高级别的语言，并且确实在稍晚的日期——1992年12月1日——交付了一个功能原型。他们确实超过了目标。原型具有工作的QuickDraw
    GX和QuickTime。尽管交付了可工作的产品，但在迈克尔·斯宾德勒接任CEO后，该项目被苹果取消了。诺韦尔随后发布了不包括苹果部件和字节的更新版DOS环境，称为Novell

- en: Through all of this, various NetWare releases were made. NetWare’s primary release
    had made it to version 4.0 by April. This version brought NetWare Directory Services
    to the market in direct competition with Microsoft Active Directory. NetWare 4
    also introduced filesystem level compression, public/private key encryption, and
    NetWare Asynchronous Services Interface which allowed the server to share multiple
    serial devices like modems with clients via port redirection. By this point, clients
    had been made at some point in time for machines on all available x86 chips, 68k
    Macintosh, VMS, UNIX, DOS, Windows, and OS/2 and servers were available for UNIX,
    OS/2, VMS, and of course NetWare as the server OS. Various versions existed for
    different price points, but the ELS system ended with 2.12, and Novell introduced
    NetWare Lite in 1991 as its successor. Following the release of version 4, however,
    the version craziness came to an end so that things like “ELS NetWare Level I
    v2.12” from March of 1990 would no longer be something that a sales person at

    and the board was increasingly worried that Novell was “*missing out on the Internet*.”

    The company he took over was decidedly moribund. From 1995 forward, all of NetWare’s
    major operating system competitors shipped with networking support out of the
    box. In particular, Noorda’s fears had materialized more strongly than anyone
    may have thought; Windows NT was good. It provided file and print services on
    a network, and it could also run applications. Unlike NetWare, NT was exceedingly
    easy to use and the entire system could be administered graphically. NT was also
    truly and fully preemptively multitasking, and perhaps most importantly for small
    businesses… NT was cheaper. NT was better than NetWare in many ways, and NT was
    cheaper than NetWare. While NetWare had emphasized speed and security above all
    else, it was a worse product in every other way for many users. In a very short
    time (start of 1997), NT had taken forty three percent of the network operating
    system market, and Novell’s NetWare had fallen to just thirty three percent.

- en: With Novell’s litigious fervor and the growing preference in the market for
    Windows NT, many resellers dropped NetWare altogether, recertified their Novell
    Certified Engineers as Microsoft Certified Professionals, and severed all ties
    with Novell. Sadly for Novell, 1999 proved to be the year that Windows NT truly
    won the fight with two million copies sold, roughly double NetWare. Yet, Novell
    was still profitable with nearly $1.3 billion in revenue and $191 million (around
    $355 million in 2024) in income.

  zh: 随着Novell的诉讼热情和市场对Windows NT的偏好增长，许多经销商完全放弃了NetWare，将他们的Novell认证工程师重新认证为Microsoft认证专业人士，并切断了与Novell的所有联系。可悲的是，对Novell而言，1999年是Windows
    NT真正赢得战斗的一年，售出了两百万份，大约是NetWare的两倍。然而，Novell仍然盈利，营收接近13亿美元，利润为1.91亿美元（约合2024年的3.55亿美元）。
- en: In 2001 after multiple rounds of layoffs, Novell needed reinvent itself. While
    Novell had always offered some services in addition to its software, the software
    was always the clear focus. Shifting to services simply wasn’t something in which
    the company had any deep expertise, and they were losing money fast, so there
    wasn’t really time enough to build that expertise internally. The solution was
    found in Cambridge Technology Partners at which Jack Messman was CEO. He also
    happened to have a board seat at Novell. The acquisition was announced on the
    13th of March in 2001 and it was completed on the 9th of July in 2001\. Jack Messman
    became CEO of the company, while Eric Schmidt remained chairman and chief strategist.
    On the 11th of July, Messman gave his first address to the unified company stating
    an intent to “*leverage synergies and execute on an innovative go-to-market strategy
    in order to best deliver on existing market opportunity.*” Schmidt had joined
    the board of Google as chairman in March of 2001, became CEO of Google in August,
    and he subsequently left Novell behind. After the CTP acquisition, Novell relocated
    to Cambridge, Massachusetts but the company chose to keep technical development
    work in Provo, Utah. In October of 2001, Novell released NetWare 6\. This release
    greatly simplified the licensing scheme for NetWare, and it added the ability
    for remote users to access intranet services. Novell lost $273 million in 2001
    (around $478 million in 2024).

  zh: 在经历了多轮裁员之后，Novell在2001年需要重塑自己。虽然Novell一直在软件之外提供一些服务，但软件始终是明确的重点。转向服务并不是公司内部深度专长的事情，而且他们正在快速亏损，因此根本没有足够的时间来内部建立这种专长。解决方案在于剑桥科技合伙公司，其CEO是杰克·梅斯曼。他还恰好在Novell担任董事会成员。这笔收购于2001年3月13日宣布，于2001年7月9日完成。杰克·梅斯曼成为公司的CEO，而埃里克·施密特仍然是主席兼首席战略家。7月11日，梅斯曼发表了他对统一公司的首次讲话，表明要“*利用协同效应，并执行创新的市场推广战略，以最好地利用现有市场机会*”。施密特于2001年3月加入了Google的董事会，并于8月成为Google的CEO，随后离开了Novell。在收购CTP之后，Novell迁至马萨诸塞州剑桥市，但公司选择在犹他州普罗沃保留技术开发工作。2001年10月，Novell发布了NetWare
    6。这个版本大大简化了NetWare的许可计划，并增加了远程用户访问内部网络服务的功能。Novell在2001年亏损了2.73亿美元（约合2024年的4.78亿美元）。
- en: As other companies before it, Novell was faced with two unbeatable foes. There
    was Microsoft on one side and Linux on the other. In response the company did
    what it had done so well in the past, it made two more acquisitions. In August
    of 2003, Novell purchased Ximian who made Evolution (an enterprise style email
    client) and Mono (an opensource .Net implementation). In November of 2003, Novell
    purchased SuSE.

  zh: 与其之前的其他公司一样，Novell面对着两个无法战胜的敌人。一方面是微软，另一方面是Linux。作为回应，公司做到了它过去做得很好的事情，进行了两次收购。2003年8月，Novell收购了制作Evolution（一种企业风格的电子邮件客户端）和Mono（开源的.Net实现）的Ximian。2003年11月，Novell收购了SuSE。
- en: 'In August of 2003, the last major release of NetWare was made: version 6.5\.
    This release brought quite a bit of open source software into NetWare with a GNU
    userland, MySQL database, and PHP while also extending quite a bit of functionality
    to the web. This final version gave NetWare customers USB storage support, a Java
    application server, and encrypted volume support. As a sign of Novell’s changing
    fortunes, however, administrators could synchronize their NetWare directory with
    either a Windows NT domain or with Active Directory. I imagine that this was the
    route through which most customers left NetWare altogether.'

  zh: 2003年8月，NetWare发布了最后一个主要版本：版本6.5。这个版本引入了大量开源软件到NetWare中，包括GNU用户空间、MySQL数据库和PHP，同时还大大扩展了Web功能。这个最终版本为NetWare客户提供了USB存储支持、Java应用服务器和加密卷支持。然而，作为Novell转运气的一个迹象，管理员可以将他们的NetWare目录与Windows
    NT域或Active Directory同步。我想这是大多数客户最终离开NetWare的途径。
- en: On the 20th of January in 2004, SCO filed a slander of title lawsuit against
    Novell in the Utah state court system. SCO’s hope was to have Novell remove all
    claims to UNIX. That case ended in Novell’s favor on the 9th of June in 2004,
    and Novell filed a counter suit against SCO on the 29th of July in 2005 with multiple
    claims. This ended on the 10th of August in 2007 with Novell being named the owner
    of both UNIX and UnixWare copyrights and with SCO being required to pay Novell
    its portion of profit from the Sun and Microsoft UNIX licenses. Before any payments
    could be made, SCO filed for bankruptcy. This move didn’t work out for the Santa
    Cruz Operation, and they were denied a stay. Appeals and motions were made, but
    on the 30th of August in 2011, an appeals court affirmed everything in Novell’s
    favor.

  zh: 2004年1月20日，SCO在犹他州法院提起了关于Novell的诽谤诉讼。SCO希望Novell撤销对UNIX的所有权主张。这个案件于2004年6月9日以Novell的胜利告终，并且Novell于2005年7月29日提起了反诉，其中包括多项主张。这个案件于2007年8月10日以Novell被认定为UNIX和UnixWare版权所有者、SCO被要求支付Novell从Sun和Microsoft
    UNIX许可中的利润份额告终。在任何支付前，SCO申请破产。这一举措对圣克鲁斯运作没有好处，他们被拒绝了留置权。虽然进行了上诉和动议，但2011年8月30日，上诉法院确认了所有有利于Novell的一切。
- en: From the time of the SuSE acquisition forward, Novell operated as an enterprise
    Linux services company, and provided support for legacy NetWare customers. The
    company laid off quite a bit of staff in 2005, and Messman was fired in 2006 along
    with Joseph Tibbetts, the CFO.
