- en: 'Remember NBA great Donnell Harvey? Neither do we. Despite being the #1 high
    school recruit in 2000—something that you think would indicate future NBA stardom—he
    put together a meager career in the league, averaging around 5 points per game
    over 5 years. On the flip side is LeBron James—the #1 high school recruit just
    a few years later—and we all know what he’s been up to.'

  zh: 还记得NBA伟大的唐纳尔·哈维吗？我们也不记得了。尽管他在2000年是排名第一的高中新秀——这种情况似乎预示着未来成为NBA明星——但他在联盟中的职业生涯却相当平庸，平均每场比赛得分约为5分，持续了5年。相比之下，勒布朗·詹姆斯——几年后的高中排名第一——我们都知道他过得怎么样。

    school. Now that we’ve entered the YouTube era, hype surrounding players can inflate

    ups, or Lamelo Ball hit threes from half court in eight grade.

- en: Even when we limit the top ranked players to just those that were eventually
    drafted, the success rate of players ranked in high school is notably higher than
    for those who weren’t. Where 92% of the drafted and ranked players made it past
    their rookie contract, only 73% of the unranked and drafted players stayed more
    than two years. Seven players—Dwyane Wade, Marc Gasol, Paul George, Jimmy Butler,Russell
    Westbrook, Stephen Curry, and Damian Lillard—whose high school careers were apparently
    not worthy of a spot amongst the top 100, still broke into the ranks of superstars
    in their NBA careers.
