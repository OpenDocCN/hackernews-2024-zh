- en: While it would be immensely gratifying to believe that our long waitlist was
    the result of our amazing efforts, it wouldn’t be 100% accurate. It’s true that
    many San Franciscan parents were willing to wait months and months for a spot
    in a high quality preschool—but that they had to wait so long reflected the fact
    that they had so few options available. In any other market, the obvious response
    to such scarcity would be to open up another preschool.

    I wrote about how bad land use rules have made it virtually impossible to build
    middle-class, family-friendly housing in most cities, which helped accelerate
    the trend of families moving to the suburbs during the pandemic. But a lack of
    available housing isn’t the only factor that influences families’ decisions to
    stay in or leave cities: schools and childcare also matter quite a lot, too. In
    addition to teaching academics, schools also provide a place for parents to put
    their kids during the workday, so the pandemic underscored just how vital the
    role of childcare was to family life. Yet long before the pandemic, expensive
    tuition and long waitlists were the norm at urban childcare centers.'

  zh: 在《[城市不适合家庭](https://www.ryanpuzycki.com/p/cities-arent-for-families)》中，我写到糟糕的土地利用规则几乎使得在大多数城市中建造中产阶级和家庭友好型住房几乎不可能，这加速了疫情期间家庭搬迁到郊区的趋势。但住房短缺并非影响家庭决定留在或离开城市的唯一因素：学校和托儿服务也同样重要。除了教学术，学校还为父母在工作日时提供了一个放置孩子的场所，因此疫情凸显了托儿服务在家庭生活中的重要性。然而，早在疫情之前，昂贵的学费和长时间的等候名单在城市托儿中心就是常态。
- en: The experience of my preschool in San Francisco was typical. Prior to relocating
    to the West Coast, I helped open a school in Brooklyn. Families were plunking
    down hefty tuition deposits two years in advance of our scheduled opening to secure
    spots in an as-yet-unbuilt school because of the city’s acute preschool shortage.
    One family even sent us a music video of their infant’s playful antics, in an
    amusing if futile attempt to boost his place on the waitlist. Supply constraints,
    driven in part by onerous land use rules and restrictions, contributed to making
    New York’s preschool market hyper-competitive, super-expensive, and a source of
    tremendous stress for families.

  zh: 我在旧金山幼儿园的经历是典型的。在搬到西海岸之前，我帮助开办了一所布鲁克林的学校。家庭们在我们计划开设两年前就已经支付了高额学费定金，以确保他们的孩子有一个未来建成的学校的位置，这是因为城市中急需的幼儿园短缺。有一家庭甚至给我们寄来他们婴儿活泼动人的音乐视频，试图通过一种有趣但徒劳的方式来增加他在等候名单上的位置。供应限制部分由于繁重的土地利用规则和限制，使得纽约的幼儿园市场变得超级竞争激烈、昂贵至极，成为家庭巨大压力的源泉。
- en: The fact that this was the status quo before the pandemic is one reason why
    so many families were already leaving cities like New York and San Francisco before

- en: Urban land use policies contribute directly to abnormal preschool shortages
    through zoning and parking mandates. In many cities, childcare is considered a
    “conditional use” in most zoning districts, which means a potential childcare
    operator must go through a lengthy approval process to open. Conditional use permitting
    (CUP) processes add tremendous time, complexity, and uncertainty, driving up childcare
    opening costs that require operators to have deep pockets and good lawyers to
    navigate successfully.

  zh: 城市土地使用政策通过区划和停车要求直接导致异常的学前儿童短缺。在许多城市中，托儿服务被视为大多数区划区域的“有条件使用”，这意味着潜在的托儿服务运营者必须经历漫长的批准过程才能开业。有条件使用许可（CUP）流程增加了巨大的时间、复杂性和不确定性，推高了托儿服务开业成本，这要求运营者必须有足够资金和优秀的律师才能成功航行。
- en: A simple fix—and one that Austin has helpfully undertaken—is to make childcare
    a “by right” use in as many zoning districts as possible, a move that now allows
    potential childcares to avoid a costly CUP process in nearly every part of the
    city. On the map below, which shows Austin before (left) and after (right) the
    reform, green is great—CUPs are only required in the yellow areas.

  zh: 一个简单的解决方案——也是奥斯汀乐意采取的——是尽可能在许多区划区域将托儿服务设为“默认使用”，这一举措现在使得潜在的托儿服务可以在城市的几乎每个地方避免昂贵的CUP流程。下面的地图显示了改革前（左）和改革后（右）的奥斯汀情况，绿色表示良好——只有黄色区域需要CUP。
- en: Most land development codes also require a certain minimum amount of on-site
    parking. These laws force developers and businesses to build more parking than
    they need while also driving up construction costs, since each parking spot can
    cost up to tens of thousands of dollars to build—and those higher costs are eventually
    passed down to renters, buyers, and customers. Parking spaces compete for all
    other space, often shrinking building square footage and limiting outdoor space
    that could be put to better uses. These mandates also create some absurd situations,
    like requiring bars to have parking lots, essentially condoning if not encouraging
    drunk driving.

  zh: 大多数土地开发法典还要求一定数量的现场停车位。这些法律迫使开发商和企业建造比他们实际需要更多的停车位，同时也推高了建筑成本，因为每个停车位的建造成本可以高达数万美元——这些更高的成本最终会转嫁给租户、购房者和顾客。停车位与所有其他空间竞争，通常会减少建筑的平方英尺并限制本可用于更好用途的室外空间。这些要求还造成一些荒谬的情况，比如要求酒吧拥有停车场，实质上容忍甚至鼓励酒后驾车。
- en: In the case of childcare, parking mandates reduce the amount of space available
    for classrooms and playgrounds—which means fewer spaces for kids. In Austin, childcares
    were until recently required to provide one parking spot per employee, regardless
    of whether employees carpooled, bicycled, walked, or rode transit to work. Fortunately,
    Austin has now abolished parking mandates, giving developers the freedom to determine
    how much parking they need, which also makes many potential sites more viable
    for childcares (or other businesses).

  zh: 就托儿服务而言，停车要求减少了用于教室和操场的空间——这意味着儿童的空间更少。在奥斯汀，直到最近，托儿服务要求每位雇员提供一个停车位，无论员工是否拼车、骑自行车、步行或乘坐公共交通上班。幸运的是，奥斯汀现已废除停车要求，使开发者可以自由决定他们需要多少停车位，这也使得许多潜在场地更适合托儿服务（或其他企业）。
- en: There are a lot of other rules that combine to make childcare as costly as college—including
    a host of state regulations that I’ll write more about in the future—but arbitrary,
    restrictive land use rules conspire to keep childcare rare and unaffordable in
    many cities. The availability of childcare (and good schools!) may be the most
    important amenity for urban parents, so such policies only serve to make urban
    life less desirable for young families.

    Bay, some with commutes topping 90 minutes each way. Similarly in New York, almost

  zh: 再说一件事：“城市不适合家庭”的重点是关于使住房不适合家庭的土地利用政策，但这些政策也使得每个人的住房更加昂贵。如果支付托儿所学费的人无法负担得起在城市生活，那对于托儿所工作的人来说也不会更容易。在旧金山的我们的学校，许多老师每天从更为经济实惠的东湾通勤，有些甚至通勤时间超过90分钟。同样，在纽约，我们的几乎所有老师都是从更为经济实惠的远离位置的那些地方通勤到我们时尚的布朗斯通布鲁克林分校区。
