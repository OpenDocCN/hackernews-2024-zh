- en: 'In the brains of these polyglots — people who speak five or more languages
    — the same language regions light up when they listen to any of the languages
    that they speak. In general, this network responds more strongly to languages
    in which the speaker is more proficient, with one notable exception: the speaker’s
    native language. When listening to one’s native language, language network activity
    drops off significantly.'

    what happens in the brains of polyglots as they listen to languages in which they

    listened to languages in which they were the most proficient. However, that did
    not hold true for the participants’ native languages, which activated the language
    network much less than non-native languages in which they had similar proficiency.
    This suggests that people are so proficient in their native language that the
    language network doesn’t need to work very hard to interpret it.

- en: “As you increase proficiency, you can engage linguistic computations to a greater
    extent, so you get these progressively stronger responses. But then if you compare
    a really high-proficiency language and a native language, it may be that the native
