  zh: '"科学进步有两种方式," 我的老朋友普罗克霍尔宣称，"一种是逐渐扩展知识边界的系统实验和分类，另一种是天才的革命性飞跃，重新定义并超越这些边界。尽管我们承认前者的债务，但我们仍然渴望后者。"
    的确，我们渴望，但亲爱的老普罗克霍尔忽略了一点，那就是飞跃是有风险的，而且风险通常是得不偿失的。不要误会 —— 这是一条危险的道路。 [传统比你更聪明](https://scholars-stage.org/tradition-is-smarter-than-you-are/)，所以脱离传统，走自己的路几乎总是注定要失败的。快速变化几乎总是不利的。人类几乎从本质上就不可能认真对待想法。我们身体里几乎每一条基因都在反对它。"人们越是对认识性无助，越是不信任极端想法，他们就越会默认采用文明的美国方式。"
    但那种英雄般行为的浪漫低概率有一种迷人的吸引力，我们的社会认识论只有在杰出人士能够忽略它的情况下才能起作用。'
- en: This all converges on liberalism, which postulates that ideas are not to be
    taken seriously. All true masterpieces bear within them an implication of extremism,
    a deep conviction in the importance of some new, radical idea, an implication
    that this singular point of view really does matter, and has the strength to overcome
    all others. Every great artwork is a fascist revolt—a form of revolt that, alas,
    does not fit very well into our æra.

  zh: 这一切都聚焦在自由主义上，自由主义主张观点不应被认真对待。所有真正的杰作都隐含着极端主义的暗示，对一些新的、激进观念的深刻信念，即这种独特的观点确实很重要，并且有力量克服其他所有观点的暗示。每件伟大的艺术品都是法西斯主义的反抗—一种反抗形式，但可惜地不太适合我们的时代。
- en: '*Freddy Got Fingered* can be streamed on Amazon. Why not check it out tonight?
    Perhaps you will catch a glimpse of the sublime in the scene where Tom Green jerks
    off an elephant and sprays his father with a pachyderm-penis firehose of sperm.
    You''re not a...*pleb*, are you?'

  zh: '*Freddy Got Fingered* 可以在亚马逊上播放。为什么今晚不试试呢？也许你会在汤姆·格林手淫大象，并用象阴茎向他的父亲喷精的场景中窥见壮丽。你不是...*俗人*，对吧？'
