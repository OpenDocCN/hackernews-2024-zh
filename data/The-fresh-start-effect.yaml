- en: The reality is that if you are going to do something that's really difficult,
    like changing your whole approach to eating, you are likely to either fail, or

    death by a thousand cuts.

  zh: 现实是，如果你要做一些真正困难的事情，比如改变你整体的饮食方式，你很可能会失败，或者随着时间的推移积累那种侵蚀你动力的微小失败，死于千刀之下。
- en: This is certainly true for me, whether it's trying to eat better, or to exercise
    more, to write more, to keep a healthy mindset with my kids, or to keep in touch

    sure I'll fail again.

    this was an effect that we immediately verified in our own user data at Lifesum.
    People began diets at the start of a new year, around their birthdays, and at
    the start of a new month. Even within a week, there was a micro-effect: people
    used us more on Mondays, and then usage would taper off over the week.'

  zh: 尽管社会科学和行为经济学中存在复制危机，但这是我们在Lifesum的用户数据中立即验证的效应。人们在新年开始时开始节食，围绕他们的生日，以及在新的一个月开始时。甚至在一个星期内，也存在微小的效应：人们在星期一更频繁地使用我们，然后使用量会在一周内逐渐减少。

    a change, you're at a moment of peak motivation. But effort alone is not enough
    to make a big change, you should also reflect on the *strategy* you're going to
    use to make it happen, and how you can develop habits that sustain your efforts
