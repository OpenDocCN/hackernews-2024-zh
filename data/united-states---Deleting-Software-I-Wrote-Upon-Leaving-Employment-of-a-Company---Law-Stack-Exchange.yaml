  zh: 数据销毁
- en: This is the easy one. The Computer Fraud and Abuse Act provides civil and criminal
    penalties when you "intentionally cause damage without authorization" to your
    employer's computers. This includes the unauthorized destruction of data, even
    if you're the one who put that data there in the first place, and even if your
    employer doesn't know about it right now. Once the data is on your employer's
    computer and being used for any length of time, then it becomes their data.
  id: totrans-split-8
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 这是一个简单的例子。计算机欺诈和滥用法案在你“未经授权故意造成损害”雇主计算机时提供民事和刑事处罚。这包括未经授权地销毁数据，即使你是最初在雇主计算机上放置数据的人，即使你的雇主现在不知道这一点。一旦数据在你的雇主计算机上并被使用了一段时间，那么它就成为他们的数据。
- en: The definition of damage is subjective, but if you know that your employer depends
    on your data, and that deleting it would negatively impact their operations, then
    deletion probably means damage in this case.
  id: totrans-split-9
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 损害的定义是主观的，但如果你知道你的雇主依赖于你的数据，并且删除它将对他们的运营产生负面影响，那么在这种情况下删除可能意味着损害。
- en: None of this means that your employer owns your software, just that they own
    the data on their devices. If you felt that your employer improperly has copies
    of your software, then you need to go through proper channels to have it removed.
  id: totrans-split-10

- en: Copyright is the legal authority to determine how a created work can be used.
    If you own the copyright to your software, then your employer probably needs your
    permission to use it. If your employer owns the copyright, then they can do whatever
    they want with it, and in fact, you would need your employer's permission to continue
    using the software.

  zh: 版权是决定如何使用创作作品的法定权力。如果你拥有软件的版权，那么你的雇主可能需要你的许可才能使用它。如果你的雇主拥有版权，那么他们可以随意处理，实际上，你需要你的雇主的许可才能继续使用该软件。
- en: 'In general, copyright belongs to the author, except in the case of a "work
    for hire." The work for hire doctrine states that an employer owns the copyright
    of anything an employee makes within the "scope of employment" for that employee.
    An easy example would be a software developer: developers are explicitly hired
    to develop software, so any software they create that is even tangentially related
    to their employer automatically becomes the property of their employer. There
    is no clear line, but the courts have found many factors that influence whether
    or not something is within the scope of your employment:'

  zh: 一般来说，版权属于作者，但在“作品委托”情况下除外。作品委托原则规定，雇主拥有员工在“雇佣范围内”创作的任何作品的版权。一个简单的例子是软件开发者：开发者明确被聘请开发软件，因此他们创建的任何与雇主甚至间接相关的软件自动成为雇主的财产。没有明确的界限，但法院已经找出许多影响是否属于你的雇佣范围的因素：
- en: a. Were the skills required for the software related to your job expectations.

- en: If you're at all uncertain about what to do, consult a lawyer in your jurisdiction.
    IP can be messy at the best of times, and in cases like this without a clear contract

  zh: 如果您对下一步该做什么有任何疑问，请在您的司法管辖区内咨询律师。知识产权在最好的时候可能也很混乱，在像这样没有明确合同的情况下情况只会变得更糟。如果最终发现您并不拥有软件的版权，那就当作一个艰苦但宝贵的人生教训，并且以此为戒。
- en: One potential thing you could do is to show your software to the higher ups
    in the company and explain yourself. If you can show how your software makes the
    warehouse more efficient, you can make a business case about the value of the
    software. If you save the company 10 hours a week of warehouse labor, that might
    be $150 a week or $7,800 a year. Maybe they're looking for someone to help streamline
    their warehouse operations and would hire you into a different role. Or, you could
    say that you're willing to sign a contract that unambiguously assigns the ownership
    of the software to the company for a reasonable sum of $2,000 or $5,000 or whatever
    number you think makes sense and see if they bite.

  zh: 您可以做的一件潜在的事情是向公司高层展示您的软件并解释自己。如果您能够展示您的软件如何使仓库更加高效，您可以就软件的价值进行商业论证。如果您每周为公司节省10小时的仓库劳动力，这可能是每周150美元或每年7,800美元。也许他们正在寻找帮助简化仓库运营的人，并愿意将您聘用到不同的角色。或者，您可以表示愿意签署一份合同，明确将软件的所有权分配给公司，以合理的金额，比如2,000或5,000美元，或者您认为合理的任何数字，并看看他们是否同意。
- en: You haven't described the scope or function of your software, but beware that
    most hobbyist projects are not actually that valuable, if at all. Maybe you've
    struck gold, but probably not. Unless there's some "secret sauce" that's especially
    hard to comprehend, it's likely that your employer could hire a developer on contract
    for a few weeks or a few months to build a similar application if they really
    wanted their own copy. But, a developer on contract might be $10,000-$20,000 a
    month or more depending on location and skill, so your goal would be to seem like
    a bargain compared to that while still adding value to the company.

  zh: 您尚未描述您的软件的范围或功能，但请注意，大多数业余项目实际上并不那么有价值，如果有的话。也许您已经找到了成功之门，但可能性不大。除非有某种特别难以理解的“秘密配方”，否则您的雇主可能会聘请一名合同开发人员来花费几周或几个月来构建类似的应用程序。但是，根据地点和技能的不同，一名合同开发人员的费用可能是每月10,000至20,000美元甚至更多，因此您的目标应该是看起来比他们便宜，同时仍然为公司增加价值。
