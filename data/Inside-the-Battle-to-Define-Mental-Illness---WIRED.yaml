    Just now, for instance, in the predawn darkness of his comfortable, rambling home
    in Carmel, California, he has broken off his exercise routine to declare that
    "there is no definition of a mental disorder. It''s bullshit. I mean, you just
    can''t define it." Then an odd, reflective look crosses his face, as if he''s
    taking in the strangeness of this scene: [Allen Frances](http://www.psychiatrictimes.com/dsm-5/content/article/10168/1425378),
    lead editor of the fourth edition of the American Psychiatric Association''s *Diagnostic
    and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders* (universally known as the [*DSM*-IV](http://allpsych.com/disorders/dsm.html)),
    the guy who wrote the book on mental illness, confessing that "these concepts
    are virtually impossible to define precisely with bright lines at the boundaries."
    For the first time in two days, the conversation comes to an awkward halt.'

  zh: '**偶尔**，Al Frances 说了些令他自己都感到惊讶的话。比如现在，在他位于加利福尼亚卡梅尔舒适而宽敞的家中的黎明前黑暗中，他中断了他的锻炼日程，宣称“没有精神疾病的定义。这是胡扯。我的意思是，你根本无法定义它。”
    然后他的脸上出现了一种奇怪而沉思的表情，仿佛他在体会这一幕的怪异：[艾伦·弗朗西斯](http://www.psychiatrictimes.com/dsm-5/content/article/10168/1425378)，美国精神病学会第四版《精神障碍诊断与统计手册》（通常称为[*DSM*-IV](http://allpsych.com/disorders/dsm.html)）的主编，这本关于精神疾病的书的作者，竟然承认“这些概念几乎不可能用明确的边界线精确地定义”。在接下来的两天中，这种对话第一次尴尬地停顿了下来。'
- en: But he recovers quickly, and back in the living room he finishes explaining
    why he came out of a seemingly contented retirement to launch a bitter and protracted
    battle with the people, some of them friends, who are creating the next edition
    of the *DSM*. And to criticize them not just once, and not in professional mumbo
    jumbo that would keep the fight inside the professional family, but repeatedly
    and in plain English, in newspapers and magazines and blogs. And to accuse his
    colleagues not just of bad science but of bad faith, hubris, and blindness, of
    making diseases out of everyday suffering and, as a result, padding the bottom
    lines of drug companies. These aren't new accusations to level at psychiatry,
    but Frances used to be their target, not their source. He's hurling grenades into
    the bunker where he spent his entire career.

  zh: 但他很快恢复过来，在客厅里继续解释他为什么会从一个看似满足的退休生活中走出来，发起一场与那些，其中一些是他的朋友，正在创建下一版《DSM》的人，进行激烈而漫长的斗争。不仅仅是一次，而且不是用专业术语，让这场斗争局限在专业家庭内部，而是在报纸、杂志和博客上多次明言，用平实的英语批评他的同事们。指责他们不仅仅是在进行糟糕的科学，而是在进行恶意、傲慢和盲目的行为，把日常痛苦变成疾病，从而增加药品公司的底线。这些并不是对精神病学的新指控，但弗朗西斯过去是它们的目标，而不是它们的来源。他向他一直从事职业生涯的地堡投掷手榴弹。
- en: One influential advocate for diagnosing bipolar disorder in kids failed to disclose
    money he received from the makers of the bipolar drug Risperdal.As a practicing
    psychotherapist myself, I can attest that this is a startling turn. But when Frances
    tries to explain it, he resists the kinds of reasons that mental health professionals
    usually give each other, the ones about character traits or personality quirks
    formed in childhood. He says he doesn't want to give ammunition to his enemies,
    who have already shown their willingness to "shoot the messenger." It's not an
    unfounded concern. In its first official response to Frances, the [APA](http://www.psych.org/)
    diagnosed him with "pride of authorship" and pointed out that his royalty payments
    would end once the new edition was published—a fact that "should be considered
    when evaluating his critique and its timing."

  zh: 一个主张在儿童中诊断双相情感障碍的有影响力的倡导者没有透露他从双相情感障碍药物利培酮的制造商那里收到的钱。作为一名实践心理治疗师，我可以证明这是一个令人震惊的转变。但当弗朗西斯试图解释时，他抵制了心理健康专业人士通常彼此给出的那些关于童年形成的性格特征或个性怪癖的理由。他说他不想给他的敌人提供弹药，他们已经表现出他们愿意“击毙使者”。这并非毫无根据的担忧。在对弗朗西斯的第一次正式回应中，[APA](http://www.psych.org/)诊断他为“自负的作者”，并指出一旦新版发布后，他的版税支付将结束——这一事实“在评估他的批评及其时机时应予考虑”。
- en: Frances, who claims he doesn't care about the royalties (which amount, he says,
    to just 10 grand a year), also claims not to mind if the APA cites his faults.
    He just wishes they'd go after the right ones—the serious errors in the *DSM*-IV.
    "We made mistakes that had terrible consequences," he says. Diagnoses of [autism](https://health.google.com/health/ref/Autism),
    attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, and bipolar disorder skyrocketed, and
    Frances thinks his manual inadvertently facilitated these epidemics—and, in the
    bargain, fostered an increasing tendency to chalk up life's difficulties to mental
    illness and then treat them with psychiatric drugs.

  zh: 弗朗西斯声称他并不在意版税（他说每年只有一万美元），他还声称并不介意APA指出他的错误。他只希望他们能追究对的错——*DSM*-IV中的严重错误。“我们犯了一些导致可怕后果的错误，”他说。自闭症、注意缺陷多动障碍和双相情感障碍的诊断数量激增，弗朗西斯认为他的手册无意中促进了这些流行病，并且在交易中，增加了把生活困难归因于精神疾病并用精神药物治疗的倾向。
- en: The insurgency against the *DSM*-5 (the APA has decided to shed the Roman numerals)
    has now spread far beyond just Allen Frances. Psychiatrists at the top of their
    specialties, clinicians at prominent hospitals, and even some contributors to
    the new edition have expressed deep reservations about it. Dissidents complain
    that the revision process is in disarray and that the preliminary results, made
    public for the first time in February 2010, are filled with potential clinical
    and public relations nightmares. Although most of the dissenters are squeamish
    about making their concerns public—especially because of a surprisingly restrictive
    nondisclosure agreement that all insiders were required to sign—they are becoming
    increasingly restive, and some are beginning to agree with Frances that public
    pressure may be the only way to derail a train that he fears will "take psychiatry
    off a cliff."

  zh: 反对*DSM*-5（APA已决定放弃罗马数字）的起义现在不仅仅限于艾伦·弗朗西斯。各自专业顶尖的精神病学家、知名医院的临床医生，甚至新版本的一些贡献者都对它深表保留。反对者抱怨修订过程混乱不堪，并且公开发表于2010年2月的初步结果充满了潜在的临床和公关灾难。尽管大多数持异议者对公开表达自己的关切感到犹豫不决——尤其是因为所有内部人员都被要求签署了一份令人惊讶的限制性保密协议——但他们变得越来越不安静，一些人开始赞同弗朗西斯的观点，即公众压力可能是阻止这趟他担心会“把精神病学推向悬崖边缘”的列车的唯一途径。
- en: At stake in the fight between Frances and the APA is more than professional
    turf, more than careers and reputations, more than the $6.5 million in sales that
    the *DSM* averages each year. The book is the basis of psychiatrists' authority
    to pronounce upon our mental health, to command health care dollars from insurance
    companies for treatment and from government agencies for research. It is as important
    to psychiatrists as the Constitution is to the US government or the Bible is to
    Christians. Outside the profession, too, the *DSM* rules, serving as the authoritative
    text for psychologists, social workers, and other mental health workers; it is
    invoked by lawyers in arguing over the culpability of criminal defendants and
    by parents seeking school services for their children. If, as Frances warns, the
    new volume is an "absolute disaster," it could cause a seismic shift in the way
    mental health care is practiced in this country. It could cause the APA to lose
    its franchise on our psychic suffering, the naming rights to our pain.

  zh: 在弗朗西斯和美国精神病学会（APA）之间的争斗中，涉及的不仅是专业领域，也不仅仅是职业和声誉，甚至不仅仅是每年平均销售额达到650万美元的*DSM*。这本书是精神病学家评判我们心理健康、要求保险公司提供治疗和政府机构提供研究资金的依据。对于精神病学家来说，它的重要性就像宪法对美国政府或圣经对基督徒的重要性一样。在专业之外，*DSM*也具有影响力，它是心理学家、社会工作者和其他心理健康工作者的权威文本；律师们在辩论犯罪被告的过失责任和父母们寻求子女学校服务时也会援引它。如弗朗西斯所警告的那样，如果新版是一个“彻头彻尾的灾难”，它可能会导致这个国家心理健康护理实践方式的地震性变化。这可能导致APA失去我们心灵痛苦的特许经营权，失去对我们痛苦的命名权。
