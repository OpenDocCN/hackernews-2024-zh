  zh: 承认起来感觉很荒谬，但我还是没有真正进入我的第一个方格。它在运河的另一边，跳不过去太宽了。我重新追溯自己的步伐，试图找另一条路。沿着小巷走回去时，我捡起了之前踩过的汉堡纸包。
- en: I pushed through a narrow gap between some bushes and a chain-link fence onto
    a narrow footpath, taking care not to snag my coat, then followed the path until
    I reached a gap by a fallen fencepost. I stepped over the tangled loops of wire
    and dropped down a wooded slope to a stagnant green pool. The surface was covered
    in duckweed, a tiny, quick-spreading plant that I later learned was being tested
    in the U.S. as a treatment for human sewage.

  zh: 我穿过灌木丛和铁链网围成的狭窄缝隙，走上了一条狭窄的小径，小心不要勾住我的外套，然后一直沿着小径走到了一个断裂的篱笆杆旁边的空隙处。我踩过交错的铁丝网，沿着树木斜坡下到了一个停滞的绿色池塘。水面上覆盖着浮萍，一种小而迅速蔓延的植物，后来我得知它在美国被用来处理人类污水。

    with Carlsberg Export cans wedged between a railway line, industrial units, marshland

- en: I stirred the pond with a stick and its stinking mysteries bubbled up from the
    black depths. I picked an apple from a tree by the railway line and popped it
    into my rucksack. Then I climbed into a field and waded through wet, knee-deep
    grass, among what Seek taught me were yellow common toadflax flowers and purple
    thistles bejeweled with droplets of dew and strands of silk webs.

- en: I headed toward the grazing meadows — once a marshland — that make up most of
    this “empty” grid square today. Gigantic electricity pylons marched across the
    land and the grey sky was striped with lines of cables running from an old coal-fired
    power station down on the coast. The station’s 200-meter-tall chimney gained some
    notoriety a few years ago when protesters climbed it to write a message to then-Prime
    Minister Gordon Brown. They only got as far as a colossal “GORDON” before being
    caught and summoned to court. They admitted trying to shut down the station, arguing
    that sabotaging it would prevent further climate warming.

  zh: 我朝着放牧草地——曾经的沼泽地——走去，如今这是这个“空旷”方格的大部分。巨大的电力铁塔横亘在土地上，灰色的天空上布满了电缆，从海岸上的一座旧燃煤发电站延伸下来。几年前，这座发电站的200米高烟囱曾引起一些轰动，当时抗议者爬上去给时任首相戈登·布朗写了一条信息。他们只写到了一个巨大的“GORDON”之前就被抓到并被传唤上法庭。他们承认试图关闭该发电站，辩称破坏它将阻止进一步的气候变暖。

    see an elevated embankment far in the distance that protected the marsh from the
    wide river that fanned out toward an estuary. A silhouetted pony grazed on the

    the preventive barriers.

- en: The noise, the movement and the human all seemed incongruous on this empty morning.
    I watched a ship slide down the river, heading out to sea with smoke streaming
    from its funnel. “Where are you going?” I called out. Which foreign port will
    you make landfall in? What will you see there? How will it smell? What cafe will
    the crew go to for a beer and a smoke, to stretch their legs? I used to travel
    to those far-off ports. I wondered if I was missing out. I continued walking,
    making a rough lap of the grid square, heading down toward its third corner.

- en: One feature marked on the map was a tiny mound that had been defined with its
    own diddy contour ring, rising a whopping five meters above sea level. It appeared
    to be nothing more than a grassy wrinkle on the flat counterpane of the marsh.
    But I had learned it was an ancient barrow, a Bronze Age burial site constructed
    over a stone coffin that once contained a crouched skeleton and a necklace of
    beads made from fossilized sea sponges. Visible ancient history added a sense
    of awe to the innocuous mound and its empty metal cattle trough.
