    the early rulers of the Eurasian steppe, the great empires that sprouted up along
    the Indus and Ganges rivers, along with their cultural satellites across South
    and Southeast Asia—history is nowhere to be found. I remember my shock when I
    discovered our knowledge of ancient India relies more on ancient Greek historians
    than ancient Indian historians. Traditional Indic civilization simply did not
    have any. In ancient India, playwrights, poets, lyricists, grammarians, philosophers,
    story-tellers, mathematicians, military strategists, religious authorities, and
    religious upstarts all put pen [to palm frond](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palm-leaf_manuscript),
    leaving a treasury of Sanskrit literature for the future. This literature is sophisticated.
    It is meaningful. Even in translation, much of it is beautiful. But search as
    you may, nowhere in this vast treasury will you ever find a work of history. That
    a great thinker could profitably spend his time sorting through evidence, trying
    to tie together cause and effect, distinguishing truth from legend, then present
    what is found in a written historical narrative—it is an idea that seems to have
    never occurred to anyone on the entire subcontinent. Only in Greece and in China
    did this notion catch hold. The work of every historian who ever lived finds its
    genesis in one of these two places—and with one of these two people.

  zh: 当高位被夺去，通向财富和权力之巅的通道被封闭时，对此几乎无能为力——除了写作。因此，历史很少是“弱者的武器”。历史学家的判断不服务于边缘。它们甚至不服务于群众。它们是被击败的精英手中的武器，是那些本可以掌权但却没有的男男女女的声音。在修昔底德时代是真实的，在我们自己的时代也是真实的。解释现代学者对21世纪资本主义的“权力结构”怀有敌意的最简单的解释是他们被完全排除在外。
- en: 'This is the motive of defeat. Intelligent enough to rule, but missing the wealth
    and position needed to lead, the historian continues the fight in the only domain
    that he or she can: the page. Here the historian wields absolute power. Given
    enough time, that power might bleed off the page and into reality. Those who know
    Cleon’s name remember him as terrible; those who recognize the name Brasidas think
    immediately of daring brilliance. I am sure nothing would have made Thucydides
    happier. As he wished they would be, this loser’s scathing judgments have lasted
    as a “possession for all time.”'

  zh: 这是失败的动机。足够聪明以至于能够统治，但缺少领导所需的财富和地位，历史学家在唯一可行的领域继续战斗：书页上。在这里，历史学家拥有绝对的权力。给予足够的时间，这种力量可能会渗透出书页，进入现实。那些知道克利昂（Cleon）名字的人记得他是可怕的；那些认出布拉西达斯（Brasidas）名字的人立刻想到的是大胆的才华。我确信没有什么能让修昔底德更开心了。正如他希望的那样，这个失败者的严厉判断已经持续作为“永恒的财产”存在。
