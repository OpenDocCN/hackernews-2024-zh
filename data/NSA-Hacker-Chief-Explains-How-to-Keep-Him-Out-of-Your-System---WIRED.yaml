    because they know better than you what's on it.

- en: '"We put the time in ...to know [that network] better than the people who designed
    it and the people who are securing it," he said. "You know the technologies you
    intended to use in that network. We know the technologies that are actually in
    use in that network. Subtle difference. You''d be surprised about the things that
    are running on a network vs. the things that you think are supposed to be there."'

    to do: limit access privileges for important systems to those who really need
    them; segment networks and important data to make it harder for hackers to reach
    your jewels; patch systems and implement application whitelisting; remove hardcoded
    passwords and legacy protocols that transmit passwords in the clear.'

    network activity and produces logs that can record anomalous activity—plus a smart
    system administrator who actually reads the logs and pays attention to what they
    say.

    on [zero-day exploits](https://www.wired.com/2014/11/what-is-a-zero-day/) extensively—unique
    attacks that take advantage of previously unknown software holes to get into systems.

  zh: 与普遍观点相反，他说NSA和其他高级持续性威胁攻击者并不广泛依赖[零日漏洞](https://www.wired.com/2014/11/what-is-a-zero-day/)——利用先前未知的软件漏洞进入系统的独特攻击。因为他们不必这样做。
- en: '"[With] any large network, I will tell you that persistence and focus will
    get you in, will achieve that exploitation without the zero days," he says. "There''s
    so many more vectors that are easier, less risky and quite often more productive
    than going down that route." This includes, of course, known vulnerabilities for
    which a patch is available but the owner hasn''t installed it.'

- en: '"It''s amazing the amount of lawyers that DHS, FBI and NSA have," Joyce said.
    "So if the government is saying that we have positive attribution too, you ought
    to book it. Attribution is really really hard, so when the government''s saying
    it, we''re using the totality of the sources and methods we have to help inform
    that. [But] because those advanced persistent threats aren''t going away, ...
    we can''t bring all that information to the fore and be fully transparent about
    everything we know and how we know it."'

  zh: “国土安全部、联邦调查局和国家安全局拥有的律师数量令人惊讶”，乔伊斯说道。“因此，如果政府表示我们也有积极的归因，你应该相信。归因真的非常非常困难，所以当政府这么说时，我们正在利用我们拥有的所有信息来源和方法来帮助确认这一点。【但是】由于这些高级持久性威胁并没有消失，...我们无法将所有信息展示出来，并完全透明地说明我们所知道的一切及其知晓方式。”
