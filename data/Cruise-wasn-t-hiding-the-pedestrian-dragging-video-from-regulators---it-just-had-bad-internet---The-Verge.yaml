- en: Cruise, the self-driving car subsidiary of General Motors, tried to send a 45-second
    video to regulators of an incident in which one of its driverless cars dragged
    a pedestrian 20 feet but was hampered by “internet connectivity issues,” according
    to a report compiled by a law firm investigating the incident.

  zh: Cruise，通用汽车的自动驾驶汽车子公司，试图向监管机构发送一段45秒的视频，展示其无人驾驶汽车拖行行人20英尺的事件，但受到“互联网连接问题”的阻碍，这是根据一家调查该事件的律师事务所编制的报告。
- en: The law firm, Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan, was hired by Cruise to determine
    whether its executives misled regulators in the aftermath of the [October 2nd
    incident](/2023/10/3/23901233/cruise-crash-hit-run-pedestrian-injury-sf-robotaxi)
    in which a hit-and-run driver struck a pedestrian, knocking her into the path
    of a driverless Cruise vehicle. Its conclusions were detailed in [a nearly 200-page
    report](https://assets.ctfassets.net/95kuvdv8zn1v/1mb55pLYkkXVn0nXxEXz7w/9fb0e4938a89dc5cc09bf39e86ce5b9c/2024.01.24_Quinn_Emanuel_Report_re_Cruise.pdf)

- en: In response to the crash, the California Department of Motor Vehicles [suspended
    Cruise’s license](/2023/10/24/23930629/california-dmv-suspends-cruise-robotaxi-permit-safety) to
    operate its vehicles in the state. The department also accused the company of
    withholding portions of the video of the incident that showed its vehicle dragging
    the pedestrian to the curb in an attempt to pull over. Cruise denies the allegation,
    claiming it showed the agency the whole video.

  zh: 作为对此事故的回应，加州车辆管理局暂停了Cruise在该州运营车辆的许可。该部门还指责该公司隐瞒了事故视频的部分内容，显示其车辆将行人拖到路边试图停车。Cruise否认了这一指控，声称向该机构展示了完整的视频。

- en: The law firm’s report appears to support both claims. The firm concludes that
    “the weight of the evidence” confirms that Cruise “played or attempted to play
    the Full Video” depicting its car dragging the woman to the curb in its October
    3rd briefing with regulators and other government officials.

  zh: 法律公司的报告似乎支持了这两项主张。该公司得出结论称，“证据的重量”证实了Cruise“播放或试图播放”在10月3日与监管机构和其他政府官员举行的会议中展示其汽车将女性拖到路边的“完整视频”。
- en: “However, in three of these meetings, internet connectivity issues likely precluded
    or hampered them from seeing the Full Video clearly and fully,” the report states.
    “And Cruise failed to augment the Full Video by affirmatively pointing out the
    pullover maneuver and dragging of the pedestrian.”

  zh: “然而，在这三次会议中，因为互联网连接问题，他们可能未能或受到了限制，无法清晰完整地观看完整的视频，”报告称。“Cruise未能通过积极指出停车操作和拖行行人来补充完整的视频。”
- en: Over 100 Cruise employees were aware of the pedestrian-dragging incident prior
    to the October 3rd meeting with the San Francisco mayor’s office, the National
    Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the DMV, and other government officials.
    But Cruise said nothing about the pedestrian being dragged, instead “letting the
    video speak for itself.” A bad internet connection prevented that from happening.

  zh: 在与旧金山市长办公室、国家公路交通安全管理局、加州车辆管理局以及其他政府官员于10月3日会议之前，有超过100名Cruise员工知晓了行人拖行事件。但Cruise对于行人被拖行的情况保持沉默，而是“让视频自己说明”。但是由于网络连接不佳，这一点未能实现。
- en: “Because Cruise adopted that approach, it did not verbally point out these facts,”
    the firm says.

  zh: “因为Cruise采用了这种方法，所以它没有口头指出这些事实，”该公司说。
- en: In the immediate hours after the incident, some Cruise employees were unaware
    that the vehicle dragged the pedestrian while attempting to pull over and issued
    a press statement and began sharing an early video with journalists. But after
    becoming aware, Cruise failed to update its statement or share the full video
    of the incident.

  zh: 在事故发生的几个小时内，部分Cruise员工不知道车辆在试图停车时拖着行人行驶，并发布了一份新闻声明并开始与记者分享一份早期视频。但在意识到这一点后，Cruise未能更新其声明或分享事故的完整视频。

  zh: Cruise没有提到行人被拖行的情况，而是希望让视频自己说话。
- en: Likewise, Cruise’s leadership was “fixated” on correcting the media narrative
    that the Cruise vehicle, and not the hit-and-run driver, had caused the accident.
    This “myopic focus” led the company to omit details about the role its own vehicle
    played in injuring the pedestrian. Cruise’s failure to correct the record led
    regulators and the media to accuse the company of misleading them, the firm states.

  zh: 同样，Cruise的领导层“专注于”纠正媒体对Cruise车辆而非肇事逃逸驾驶员造成事故的叙述。这种“近视焦点”导致公司忽略了其自身车辆在伤害行人方面发挥的作用的细节。该公司未能纠正记录导致监管机构和媒体指责该公司误导他们。
- en: Largely, a culture of antagonism toward regulators at Cruise helped contribute
    to these failings. In its interviews with employees, Cruise “observed too much
    of an ‘us versus them’ attitude... which is not indicative of a healthy, mutually
    productive relationship,” says the Quinn Emanuel report.

  zh: 在很大程度上，Cruise对监管机构存在对抗文化有助于造成这些失误。在与员工的面谈中，Cruise“观察到了过多的‘我们对抗他们’的态度......这并不表明健康、相互有益的关系”，Quinn
    Emanuel报告称。
- en: The firm says it is a “fundamentally flawed approach” to assume a video can
    “speak for itself” and remove the need to disclose all details to regulators and
    government officials. “As one Cruise employee stated in a text message to another
    employee about this matter, our ‘leaders have failed us,’” the report states.

  zh: 该公司表示，假设视频可以“自己说话”并且无需向监管机构和政府官员披露所有细节是一种“根本错误的方法”。报告指出：“正如一位Cruise员工在发给另一位员工的短信中所说，我们的‘领导让我们失望了’。”
