    about subverting open source projects recently. That incident made me think about
    something that''s generally on my mind. That thought again was triggered by that
    incident but is otherwise not in response to it. I want to talk about some of
    the stresses of being an Open Source contributor and maintainer but specifically
    about something that have been unsure over the years about: anonymity and pseudonymity.'

  zh: 最近有一些关于破坏开源项目的[纠纷](https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/03/29/4)。这一事件让我再次思考了一些长期以来一直在我脑海中的事情。这种思考虽然是由那个事件触发的，但并不是对它的回应。我想讨论的是作为开源贡献者和维护者所面临的一些压力，尤其是关于多年来一直不确定的匿名和化名问题。
- en: Over the years it has been pretty clear that some folks are contributing in
    the Open Source space and don't want to have their name attached to their contributions.
    I'm not going to judge if they have legitimate reasons for doing so or if pseudonymity
    a good or bad thing. That it is happening, is simply a fact of life. The consequences
    of that however are quite interesting and I think worth discussing.

  zh: 多年来，显而易见的是，一些人在开源领域做贡献时不希望将他们的名字与贡献联系起来。我不打算评判他们是否有合理的理由这样做，或者匿名是否是好事还是坏事。事实上，这种情况的发生只是生活的一部分。然而，这样做的后果确实非常有趣，我认为值得讨论。
- en: When I talk about names, I primarily think about the ability to associate an
    online handle and a contribution to a real human being. That does not imply that
    it should be necessarily trivial for people to find that information, but it should
    be something that is at least in principle be possible. There is obviously a balance
    to all of this, but given that there are real consequences to “doing stuff on
    the internet” there has to be a way to get in contact with the person behind it.
    So as far as “naming a person” here is concerned it's not so much about a particular
    name, but as in being able to identify the human being behind it.

  zh: 当我谈论名字时，我主要考虑的是能够将一个在线处理与一个真正的人的贡献联系起来。这并不意味着人们应该轻易找到这些信息，但至少在原则上应该是可能的。显然，这其中存在一种平衡，但考虑到在“互联网上做事”会有真正的后果，必须有一种方法可以联系到其背后的人。因此，就“给一个人命名”的问题而言，这并不是那个特定名称的问题，而是能够识别其背后的人。
- en: While we might get away with believing nothing on the internet matters and laws
    do not apply, that's not really true. In fact particularly with Open Source we're
    all leveraging copyright laws and the ability to enforce contracts to work together.
    And no matter how much we write “THIS SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED BY THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS
    AND CONTRIBUTORS “AS IS” AND ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES” not all legal
    consequences can be waived.

- en: 'Which leads me to some development in internet anonymity I have observed over
    the last 20 years which I find worth reflecting on. When I got started with Open
    Source, pseudonyms felt much less common. The distance to the legal system at
    least to me felt much closer than today. I give you a handful examples of this:
    When I got started doing stuff on the internet and you did something really stupid,
    someone called your ISP and you had an angry conversation. Because the subscriber
    of that line was known. A lot of the systems on the earlier internet were based
    on a lot more trust than would be acceptable today. An angry ISP was not the worst
    that would happen to you, a lot of people got charged with wire-fraud for things
    that today are just being ignored because they have become too commonplace (like
    probably most DDOS attacks these days). When I created my first SourceForge account,
    the “real name” field was not optional, CLAs talked about names and asked for
    signatures. When my stuff was packaged up in Debian some of the first things that
    came my way were folks explaining me some legal stuff about licenses I was unaware
    before. After I started getting involved with Ubuntu I went to a key signing party
    where I showed my passport to other human beings to demonstrate that I exist.
    When I became a Python core contributor I signed a physical paper for the CLA.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 这让我想起我在过去20年间观察到的一些互联网匿名发展，我认为值得反思。当我开始接触开源时，化名似乎不太常见。至少对我来说，与法律系统的距离感比今天要近得多。我给你举几个例子：当我开始在互联网上做一些事情，如果你做了什么很愚蠢的事情，有人会打电话给你的ISP，然后你会有一次愤怒的对话，因为知道那条线路的订户。早期互联网上的很多系统都是基于比今天更多的信任。愤怒的ISP并不是最糟糕的事情，很多人因为现在被视为司空见惯的事情而被指控为电信欺诈（比如大部分DDOS攻击）。当我创建我的第一个SourceForge账户时，“真实姓名”字段是必填的，CLA谈论了名字并要求签名。当我的东西被打包到Debian时，一些关于我之前不了解的许可证法律问题的人来解释给我听。在我开始参与Ubuntu之后，我参加了一个密钥签名派对，我向其他人展示了我的护照以证明我的存在。当我成为Python核心贡献者时，我签署了CLA的实体文件。
- en: A lot of this feels quite untypical today. We no longer do a lot of these things
    and I believe it mostly just works because people don't go to court much about
    Open Source projects any more. It probably also works because over time Open Source
    became more established. If you contribute via GitHub today, even the terms of
    service probably help resolving copyright issues by being quite explicit about
    how contributions to public repositories happen (you contribute under the license
    of the repository).

  zh: 很多事情今天看起来都很不典型。我们不再做很多这些事情了，我相信这主要是因为人们在开源项目上很少再走上法庭。这可能也因为随着时间的推移，开源变得更加确立。如果你今天通过
    GitHub 贡献，即使服务条款也可能通过非常明确地阐述公共仓库的贡献方式来帮助解决版权问题（你以仓库的许可证授权贡献）。
- en: 'But sometimes people do go to court. Open Source projects in many ways are
    an unclear amalgamation of different contributions and we just collectively hope
    that we all agree that contributions come in under the same licenses as the file
    in the root of the project. The Linux kernel once did not accept contributions
    from pseudonymous users. It did so for good reasons. They need to know who the
    person is that contributes so they know what to do in case of a licensing conflict
    and there was more than one lawsuit involving Linux. This was true even after
    the [DCO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developer_Certificate_of_Origin) was put
    in place. Today, pseudonyms are accepted. Not just in Linux, but also in many
    large projects. An example of that is the CNCF which found a nice middle ground
    on the name and what you sign off with: “A real name does not require a legal
    name, nor a birth name, nor any name that appears on an official ID (e.g. a passport).
    Your real name is the name you convey to people in the community for them to use
    to identify you as you.”'

  zh: 但有时人们确实会走上法庭。开源项目在很多方面都是不明确的不同贡献的混合体，我们只是集体希望大家都同意，贡献以与项目根目录下的同一许可证授权为准。Linux
    内核曾一度不接受化名用户的贡献。这样做是有原因的。他们需要知道贡献者的真实身份，以便在许可证冲突时知道该如何处理，而 Linux 也曾涉及多起诉讼。即使在[DCO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developer_Certificate_of_Origin)实施后仍然如此。今天，接受化名用户贡献已经成为常态。不仅仅是在
    Linux，许多大型项目也是如此。其中一个例子是 CNCF，在姓名和签名的规定上找到了一个不错的折中点：“真实姓名并不需要是法律姓名，也不需要是出生姓名，也不需要是任何官方身份证件上出现的姓名（例如护照）。你的真实姓名是你向社区中的人们传达，以便他们用来识别你的名字。”
- en: 'Most important however is this part: “Your real name should not be an anonymous
    id or false name that misrepresents who you are.” The need of getting in contact
    with the person exists and did not go away. It always existed and it quite likely
    will continue to exist. There are good reasons why you want to know who the person
    is. Maybe the person contributed code they did not own the copyright of, maybe
    their employer writes you an angry email. Concerns about licensing are a common
    reason for why people want to know who the people are that contribute. Maybe sanctions
    or other legal restrictions prevent to accept contributions from that person.
    Another reason you might need to get in contact with the author is to change the
    license. You might remember that a lot of projects tried to move from GPL v2 to
    GPL v2 or later. A change that required the agreement of every person that contributed
    before. Reaching out to people sometimes is not the easiest of tasks.'

  zh: 然而，最重要的是这一部分：“你的真实姓名不应该是一个匿名 ID 或误导他人的虚假名称。”与这个人取得联系的需求存在并且没有消失。它一直存在，而且很可能将继续存在。你想知道这个人是谁有很多很好的理由。也许这个人贡献了他们不拥有版权的代码，也许他们的雇主给你写了一封愤怒的电子邮件。对于人们想知道贡献者是谁的担忧，许可证问题是一个常见的原因。也许制裁或其他法律限制阻止接受来自该人的贡献。你可能需要与作者取得联系的另一个原因是改变许可证。你可能记得很多项目试图从
    GPL v2 移动到 GPL v2 或更高版本。这种变更要求得到之前每个贡献者的同意。有时与人联系并不是最容易的任务之一。
- en: However in addition to pseudonymous contributions, there is also a sharp increase
    of anonymous contributions. Particularly thanks to GitHub pull requests it's incredibly
    common that you get commits now from folks whose only identity is a made up user
    name, no visible email address and some default avatar that GitHub generated.

  zh: 但除了假名贡献之外，匿名贡献也在急剧增加。特别是由于 GitHub 的拉取请求，现在非常普遍，你会收到来自完全匿名的贡献者的提交，他们唯一的身份只是一个虚构的用户名，没有可见的电子邮件地址，以及
    GitHub 生成的一些默认头像。
- en: This is not necessarily a problem, but to me it feels like a trend that I'm
    not sure how to work with. It creates a somewhat complex form of interaction where
    one person might be out in the open, the other person might be entirely anonymous.
    Many of us old timers who went into Open Source in former times have a pretty
    well established online identity (either via a “real name” or pseudonym). I also
    think that many of us who are in this for a while feel quite a bit of stress and
    responsibility for the things we created, at least that is very much true for
    me. Multiple times over the years did I hear or read online that a person chooses
    to contribute anonymously is because their employer bans Open Source work. One
    the one hand it's great that people find a way to avoid these restrictions, on
    the other hand if that ever gets found out you probably are going to have some
    unfriendly talks with someone else's legal team. While in practice none of my
    code is important enough that I think something like this will happen, I can absolutely
    see this happen to large Open Source projects where a rogue employee contributes
    on their employer's time or otherwise proprietary code.

  zh: 这不一定是问题，但对我来说，这种趋势似乎有些难以应对。它造成了一种相对复杂的互动形式，在这种形式中，一方可能公开示人，而另一方可能完全匿名。我们许多老手在早期进入开源时，已经有了相当完善的在线身份（无论是通过“真实姓名”还是假名）。我也认为，我们中许多人在这个领域工作了一段时间后，对我们创造的东西感到相当紧张和负责，至少对我来说是这样。多年来，我多次听说或在网上读到，一个人选择匿名贡献是因为他们的雇主禁止开源工作。一方面，人们能找到一种避开这些限制的方法是很好的，但另一方面，如果这被发现了，你可能会与别人的法律团队进行一些不友好的对话。尽管实际上我的代码没有那么重要，我绝对可以看到这种情况在大型开源项目中发生，一个员工在雇主的时间内贡献了一些代码或者其他专有代码。
- en: 'I have a heard the sentiment a few times now that one should vet the contributions,
    not the contributors. That''s absolutely true. Yet at the same time many of us
    are quite frankly assuming good actors and just happy to get contributions. We
    sometimes merge pull requests not in the best state of mind, sometimes we feel
    pressured. It can be quite hard to spot back doors and hostile commits, particularly
    if the other side is sufficiently motivated. But here is the thing: you know who
    I am, I do not know who a lot of the people are that send pull requests against
    my libraries. An asymmetry I need to work with.'

  zh: 我已经多次听到一种观点，认为我们应该审查贡献，而不是贡献者。这绝对是对的。然而与此同时，我们很多人确实是假定有良好意图的行为者，很高兴能得到贡献。有时候我们会在不太理智的状态下合并拉取请求，有时我们感到压力。如果另一方有足够的动机，要识别后门和敌对的提交可能会相当困难。但问题在于：你知道我是谁，但我不知道那些向我的库发送拉取请求的人是谁。这是一个我需要应对的不对称现象。
- en: What motivates me to write this, is that I feel quite a bit of asymmetry in
    contributions these days. It's a lot easier to contribute to Open Source these
    days and that's a good thing. But it also comes at a cost. It's impossible to
    find yourself having become a critical piece of software deployed all over the
    world by accident. Your users update to the latest version of your code without
    any vetting on their own. Yet the brunt of the responsibility falls on you, the
    person associated with the project. A person that might be known. Yet a lot of
    the contributions are random people, and you might not have a good change to identify
    them. Sometimes it's not even the contributions, it's already anonymous users
    on the issue trackers that increase that pressure.

- en: Which brings me back to the identity thing. It's probably great for a lot of
    people that their online identity is not clearly linked to the real world identity.
    What I find less great is that with this loss of real identity many of the real
    world legal consequences are then stuck with me, a person that can be identified.
    I don't assume that knowing who the folks are that contribute will solve any problems,
    mind you. While I do have some probably unrealistic hope that law enforcement
    agencies would find it a bit easier to get involved if they can better identify
    a bad actor, I'm not even sure if they find much of an interest to get involved

    in a way. I take responsibility of someone else's commit with the moment I press

    you do start to trust repeated contributors after a while. A well established
    identity on the internet creates a form of inner peace, a handing over a project
    more and more to a person you don't know less so. Yet it can happen absolutely
