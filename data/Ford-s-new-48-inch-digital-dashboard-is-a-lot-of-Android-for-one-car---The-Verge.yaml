  zh: 此外，人们对寻找基本控制所需的复杂程度日益感到沮丧。[最近的 JD Power 调查](/23801545/car-infotainment-customer-satisifaction-survey-jd-power)
    发现，车主的整体满意度比一年前下降了两个百分点，比 2021 年低了三个百分点。这是该研究 28 年历史上消费者研究公司首次连续两年的业主满意度下降。

- en: Ford’s product team cited this survey while presenting its new digital interface,
    arguing its new software will be easier and more user-friendly than other systems.
    But soon after, I was sitting in the driver’s seat of a Lincoln Nautilus watching
    a designer demonstrate how to direct climate control by tapping the touchscreen
    and moving the air current around with the tip of my finger. No physical knobs
    to adjust the vent, just the screen.

  zh: 福特的产品团队在展示其新数字界面时引用了这项调查，认为其新软件将比其他系统更容易使用和更用户友好。但是不久之后，我就坐在林肯航海家的驾驶座上，看着一位设计师演示如何通过触摸屏幕和用手指尖移动空气流来控制气候。没有物理旋钮来调整通风口，只有屏幕。
- en: Ford isn’t the only company routing more controls through its screens. Tesla
    was the first to replace physical controls for functions like climate control
    and windshield wiper speed with digital interfaces. Other automakers have followed,
    leading some safety experts to decry what they see as the rapid extinction of
    physical controls.

  zh: 福特不是唯一一个通过屏幕路由更多控件的公司。特斯拉是第一个用数字界面替代诸如气候控制和雨刷器速度之类的功能的物理控制的公司。其他汽车制造商也纷纷效仿，导致一些安全专家对他们所认为的物理控件的迅速消失感到不满。
- en: Ford’s approach was to combine the teams responsible for physical and digital
    interfaces to reduce competition between designers, Field said. The company also
    analyzed anonymized data of how its customers interact with their screens, including
    how often they change settings to surface certain controls, to get a better sense
    of which controls they prefer to be physical versus digital.

  zh: 福特的方法是将负责物理和数字界面的团队合并，以减少设计师之间的竞争，Field 说。该公司还分析了客户如何与其屏幕互动的匿名化数据，包括他们多频繁更改设置以显示某些控件，以更好地了解他们更喜欢哪些控件是物理的，哪些是数字的。
- en: “I think the way you execute a screen has a lot to do with whether people become
    really angry that you pulled a button off,” he said. “So it is a hard balance,
    because the returns you get from moving stuff to the screen aren’t always quite
    as apparent.”

  zh: “我认为你执行屏幕的方式很大程度上取决于人们是否因为你拿走了一个按钮而变得非常生气，”他说。“因此，这是一个很难平衡的问题，因为你将东西移至屏幕上所获得的回报并不总是那么明显。”
- en: He added, “Some of it also is a leap of faith that you will be on a journey
    with the customer. And help them learn over time, that hey, this is actually really
    cool.”
