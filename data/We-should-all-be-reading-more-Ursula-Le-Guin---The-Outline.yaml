    his own body and that of his prey. This is important. If his aim is true, if the

    tells the story of the carrier bag, the sling, the shell, or the gourd. In this
    empty vessel, early humans could carry more than can be held in the hand and,
    therefore, gather food for later. Anyone who consistently forgets to bring their
    tote bag to the supermarket knows how significant this is. And besides, Le Guin
    writes, the idea that the spear came before the vessel doesn’t even make sense.
    “Sixty-five to eighty percent of what human beings ate in those regions in Paleolithic,
    Neolithic, and prehistoric times was gathered; only in the extreme Arctic was
    meat the staple food.”

    of history as a long line of victories. Le Guin describes her discovery of the
    carrier bag theory as grounding her “in human culture in a way I never felt grounded
    before.” The stick, sword, or spear, designed for “bashing and killing,” alienated
    her from history so much that she felt she “was either extremely defective as
