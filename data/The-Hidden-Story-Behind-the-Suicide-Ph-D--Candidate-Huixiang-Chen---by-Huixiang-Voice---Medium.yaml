- en: 'As you know, since last year December, I wrote an ISCA paper in a very short
    time and it was submitted and accepted very quickly. As all of you know the reason,
    it was owe to our professor Dr.Tao Li ’s networking. Among the six reviewers of
    my paper, four of them are friends of Tao Li. But this paper has very severe issues:
    the design doesn’t make any sense and the reviewers also pay no attention to it.
    The paper was accepted at no reason which can make anyone feel guilty in this
    case.'

  zh: 众所周知，自去年12月以来，我在很短的时间内写了一篇ISCA论文，并且非常快地提交并被接受了。正如你们所知道的原因，这归功于我们的导师李涛博士的人脉关系。在我论文的六位审稿人中，有四位是李涛的朋友。但这篇论文存在非常严重的问题：设计毫无意义，审稿人也没有对此予以关注。这篇论文无理由被接受，这种情况会让任何人感到内疚。
- en: After the deadline, crazy modifications of the paper were made and I started
    to make up for the missing experiments. During those experiments, I found that
    the phenomenon of the experiments and the design was different from what was claimed
    before, which made this paper doesn’t make any sense from title to characterization
    and to design. For example, It was claimed that this (the accelerator) is targeted
    for 3D CNN, which can maximize the performance by changing Diffy architecture
    to achieve the dynamic control of the temporal delta and spatial delta. But there
    are too many issues with this. First of all, the Diffy architecture has a serious
    problem of synchronization. If the width of the input feature is too narrow, the
    overhead of lane synchronization … . But it was assumed that the temporal dimension
    of 3D CNN (the maximum is generally 16 and it will decrease with layer) will expand
    with Diffy. Secondly, it can’t skip zero, because of the synchronization of lane
    and the incremental of spatial/temporal delta. So if I want to make a change the
    whole paper need to be rewrite. It is unrealistic to propose a totally new idea
    before the final version. After I communicated with Tao Li, it turned out that
    I have to fix the paper by myself. Until today I am still unable to patch up any
    of those issues. These issues are too obvious which can be easily caught by any
    experts of accelerator. I have no words to comment that Dr. Li acquiesced to the
    data which makes no sense.

  zh: 截止期限后，论文进行了疯狂的修改，我开始弥补缺失的实验。在这些实验中，我发现实验现象与设计有所不同，这使得论文从标题到表征再到设计都毫无意义。例如，曾声称（加速器）针对3D
    CNN，可以通过改变Diffy架构来实现时间增量和空间增量的动态控制，从而最大化性能。但存在太多问题。首先，Diffy架构存在严重的同步问题。如果输入特征的宽度过窄，通道同步的开销……。但假定3D
    CNN的时间维度（最大一般为16且随着层次减少）会随Diffy扩展。其次，它无法跳过零，因为通道同步和空间/时间增量的增量。因此，如果我想做出改变，整篇论文都需要重写。在最终版本之前提出全新的想法是不现实的。在我与李涛交流后，结果是我必须自己修复论文。直到今天，我仍然无法弥补其中任何问题。这些问题太明显了，任何加速器专家都能轻易捕捉到。我对李博士默认这些无意义的数据无话可说。
- en: Considering that this will have an impact on my career in the future and my
    reputation in the area of Computer Architecture, my future life will be worse
    than death and I will be totally in a dilemma. I considered all the cases, I really
    can’t work them around. In order to make up for the fault, I decide to suicide.
    I hope you can learn my lessons and don’t mess around things. We shall never claim
    too much in the paper before we can really achieve it. I hope this will make a
    change in this world.
