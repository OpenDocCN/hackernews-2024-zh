    seven days to officially disclose that a criminal has broken into their systems.

  zh: FCC更新的报告要求意味着美国的电信公司仅有七天的时间来正式披露其系统已遭入侵的情况。
- en: After releasing a [proposed](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2024/02/12/2024-01667/data-breach-reporting-requirements)
    rule in early January and giving the industry 30 days to respond, the FCC's [final
    rule](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2024/02/12/2024-01667/data-breach-reporting-requirements)
    was published today. It solidifies what the agency proposed a little more than
    a month ago, and what was teased in early 2022 when FCC chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel
    [drafted initial changes](https://www.theregister.com/2022/01/13/fcc_data_rules/)
    to the commission's 16-year old security "breach" reporting duties.

  zh: 在早年一月发布了[提案](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2024/02/12/2024-01667/data-breach-reporting-requirements)规则并给予行业30天时间作出回应后，FCC今天发布了[最终规则](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2024/02/12/2024-01667/data-breach-reporting-requirements)，巩固了该机构一个多月前提出的建议，以及FCC主席杰西卡·罗森沃尔塞尔在2022年初起草的对委员会16年来安全"泄露"报告职责的初步修改。
- en: Along with requiring that attacks are reported to the FCC within seven days
    of a telco discovering them, the same deadline now exists to report any data leaks
    to the FBI and US Secret Service as well. As the FCC planned, the new rule also
    eliminates the mandatory seven-day waiting period for reporting break-ins to consumers.
  id: totrans-split-8

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 除了要求攻击在电信公司发现后的七天内向FCC报告外，现在还存在同样的截止日期，用于向FBI和美国特勤局报告任何数据泄漏。正如FCC所计划的那样，新规则还取消了向消费者报告入侵的强制性七天等待期。
- en: The FCC now "requires carriers to notify customers of breaches of covered data
    without unreasonable delay … and in no case more than 30 days following reasonable
    determination of a breach."
  id: totrans-split-9

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: FCC现在"要求运营商在合理判断存在泄露之后，及时而非超过30天内通知客户有关泄露的涵盖数据的信息"。
- en: '"Reasonable determination" of a data blurt is further defined as "when the
    carrier has information indicating that it is more likely than not that there
    was a breach" and "does not mean reaching a conclusion regarding every fact surrounding
    a data security incident that may constitute a breach."'
  id: totrans-split-10
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 对于数据泄露的"合理判断"进一步定义为"当运营商掌握信息表明泄漏更可能发生而不是不存在泄漏的情况"，而不意味着要对可能构成泄露的数据安全事件的每一个事实达成结论。
- en: In other words, if customers are affected then they had better be notified post-haste.
  id: totrans-split-11

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 换句话说，如果客户受到影响，他们最好立即得到通知。
- en: The FCC has additionally extended the scope of data exposure types that telecom
    customers must be notified of. Prior to the passage of the new rule customers
    only had to be told if Customer proprietary network information (CPNI) was exposed
    to the world.
  id: totrans-split-12
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: FCC此外还扩展了电信客户必须通知的数据曝光类型的范围。在新规则通过之前，客户只需在其专属网络信息（CPNI）向外界暴露时收到通知。
- en: CPNI, for those unfamiliar, is all the data a cellular carrier retains about
    phone calls and service agreements - i.e., the data that appears on a bill. Personal
    identifiable information (PII) wasn't included in previous reporting requirements,
    meaning carriers whose customer records were exposed, didn't have to tell customers
    if CPNI wasn't accessed.
  id: totrans-split-13
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 对于不熟悉的人来说，CPNI是移动运营商保留的关于电话通话和服务协议的所有数据 - 也就是出现在账单上的数据。个人可识别信息（PII）以前的报告要求中并不包括在内，这意味着如果没有访问CPNI，则曝光了客户记录的运营商不必告知客户。
- en: '"Without an FCC rule requiring breach notifications for the above categories
    of PII, there would be no requirement in Federal law that telecommunications carriers
    report non-CPNI breaches to their customers," the FCC said of the new rule.'
  id: totrans-split-14
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: '"如果没有FCC规则要求通知上述PII类别的泄露，那么联邦法律中不会要求电信运营商向客户报告非CPNI的泄漏，" FCC在新规则中如此说道。'
- en: Starting now, names, government ID numbers, data used for authentication purposes,
    email addresses/passwords and biometric data is all included in the FCC's reporting
    requirements. Dissociated data, if linkable to an individual using other data
    criminals accessed during a break-in, has to be reported as well.
  id: totrans-split-15
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 从现在开始，姓名、政府身份证号码、用于认证目的的数据、电子邮件地址/密码和生物识别数据都包括在FCC的报告要求中。如果犯罪分子在入侵期间访问的其他数据可以链接到个人，那么分离的数据也必须报告。
- en: The new rules add an exception for customer notifications as well. If a carrier
    can "determine that no harm to customers is reasonably likely to occur," then
    it doesn't have to inform subscribers of the incident.
  id: totrans-split-16

  zh: 新规还为客户通知增加了一个例外。如果运营商能够“确定不太可能对客户造成伤害”，那么它就不必通知订户有关该事件的信息。
- en: Along with increased reporting rules for the content of data leaks, the new
    rule also expands the FCC's definition of "breach" to include "inadvertent access,
    use or disclosure of customer information."

  zh: 除了增加的数据泄漏内容报告规则外，新规还扩展了联邦通信委员会（FCC）对“泄漏”的定义，包括“意外访问、使用或披露客户信息”。

    in the House and Senate to overturn the SEC's four-day reporting deadline for

    by extension, its investors.
