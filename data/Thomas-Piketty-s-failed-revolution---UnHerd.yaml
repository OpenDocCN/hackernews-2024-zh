- en: The scientific study of “top incomes” originated in the early 2000s, led by
    the late British economist, Tony Atkinson, who struck up a collaboration with
    Piketty, based in Paris, and Emmanuel Saez in Berkeley. This yielded a series
    of academic articles and edited volumes, which passed under the radar of general
    readers or the media, back when nobody had ever spoken of “the 1%”. One distinguishing
    feature of this programme was a willingness to use novel sources of empirical
    data, namely tax records. Another was the study of very long-term historical trends,
    over not just decades but centuries. “The Top Incomes Database”, which first presented
    the kinds of graphs with which *Capital in the Twenty-First Century* is littered,
    was launched at a conference hosted by Atkinson and Piketty in Paris in 2011.

  zh: “顶端收入”的科学研究起源于2000年代初，由已故英国经济学家托尼·阿特金森主导，他与居住在巴黎的皮凯蒂以及伯克利的埃马纽尔·塞兹展开了合作。这导致了一系列学术文章和编辑的专著，当时这些内容并未引起普通读者或媒体的关注，当时还没有人谈论“1%”。该项目的一个显著特征是愿意使用新的经验数据来源，即税务记录。另一个特征是对非常长期的历史趋势进行研究，不仅仅是数十年，而是数个世纪。“顶端收入数据库”最早是在2011年由阿特金森和皮凯蒂在巴黎举办的会议上发布的，该数据库展示了《二十一世纪的资本》中充斥着的各种图表。
- en: Given the extraordinary historical reach of this research field, there was nothing
    explicitly contemporary about its findings or implications, especially during
    those years when few politicians or commentators were worrying about inequality.
    Most people had a general sense that inequality had been rising since Thatcher
    and Reagan came to power, but political attention under New Labour was squarely
    focused on alleviating poverty, and not on the other end of the income spectrum
    (which, famously, Peter Mandelson was “intensely relaxed” about).

  zh: 鉴于这一研究领域的非凡历史影响力，其研究结果或影响特别是在那些很少有政客或评论家担心不平等问题的年代，并不显得特别当代。大多数人对于自撒切尔和里根执政以来不平等加剧有一种普遍的感觉，但新工党政府的政治关注焦点主要集中在减少贫困，而不是收入端的另一端（正如彼得·曼德尔森所称的，“非常轻松”）。
- en: The global financial crisis did disrupt that complacency, but not simply because
    of “Fred the Shred” or because George Osborne took an axe to various social safety
    nets. Piketty and his publishers lucked out because the macrofinancial paradigm
    of the post-2008 world suddenly rendered the “R>G” tendency (which Piketty argued
    had been around for at least 200 years) impossible to ignore. Britain in particular
    experienced its longest period of wage stagnation since the industrial revolution,
    while asset prices (including housing) soared. Quantitative easing poured boundless
    cheap money into equities, facilitating the sharp ascent of BlackRock and other
    giant asset managers. Fiscal tightening and unprecedented monetary loosening combined
    to offer as devastating a demonstration of Piketty’s thesis as he could possibly
    have imagined.

  zh: 全球金融危机确实打破了这种自满，但并非仅因为“弗雷德·萨瑞德”（Fred the Shred）或乔治·奥斯本（George Osborne）对各种社会安全网进行了砍减。皮凯蒂和他的出版商们幸运地因为后2008年世界的宏观金融范式突然使“R>G”倾向（皮凯蒂认为至少存在了200年）变得不容忽视。特别是英国经历了自工业革命以来最长的工资停滞期，同时资产价格（包括房价）飙升。量化宽松将无限廉价资金注入股票市场，促进了黑石集团和其他巨型资产管理公司的急剧上升。财政紧缩和空前的货币宽松结合起来，提供了皮凯蒂论点的毁灭性证明，这是他可能想象到的最具破坏力的示范。
- en: 'In this Pikettyan dystopia, the wealthy didn’t need to take any risks or become
    Gordon Gekko to swell their portfolios further; they simply needed to take advantage
    of the glut of cheap credit and hire a wealth manager. *Capital in the Twenty-First
    Century* arrived with a historical account of a phenomenon that had been largely
    forgotten about: the idle rich, living off passive investments and inheritances.
    Everything that Marx had admired about capitalism — its modernism, its upheaval,
    the insatiable hunger for productivity gains — was nowhere to be seen. In his
    rather nerdish, atheoretical manner, coolly tracing the ebbs and flows of wealth
    since the Enlightenment, Piketty held up an image of capitalism that was less
    characterised by class conflict, exploitation or upheaval, and more by the sheer
    durability of estates and portfolios over time.'

  zh: 在这个皮凯蒂式的厄运中，富人们无需承担任何风险或像戈登·盖科那样成为富豪，只需利用廉价信贷的过剩并聘请财富管理师。《二十一世纪资本论》提供了一个历史账户，描绘了一个几乎被遗忘的现象：懒散富人，靠
    passively 投资和遗产生活。马克思所称赞的资本主义的一切 —— 它的现代主义，动荡，对生产力增益的贪婪 —— 这些都不复存在。皮凯蒂以他那种相当理论化的、冷静地追踪自启蒙时代以来财富的涨落的方式，展示了一个资本主义的形象，这个形象不再以阶级冲突、剥削或动荡为特征，而是更多地表现为财产和投资组合的持久性。
- en: Marxists scoffed. After all, where had all this wealth originated from, if not
    from relations of production that were essentially exploitative? But Piketty’s
    analysis spoke to a range of other struggles and injustices that often had little
    to do with production and employment, but which became increasingly prominent
    as the decade wore on. Piketty’s definition of “capital” (“the sum total of nonhuman
    assets that can be owned and exchanged on some market”) decentred productive capital,
    but shone a fresh light on how wealth in general is protected and passed on, via
    inheritance, tax avoidance, “philanthropy” and other forms of gift-giving, all
    of which were politicised in the 2010s. Social scientists were soon filling in
    the blanks, with fascinating studies of the legal services, “family offices”,
    elite schools and offshore trusts that insulated the new oligarchy from political
    interference.

  zh: 马克思主义者们嗤之以鼻。毕竟，如果不是来自于基本上是剥削性的生产关系，这些财富又是从哪里来的呢？但皮凯蒂的分析触及了一系列与生产和就业关系不大但在这十年中日益突出的其他斗争和不公正。皮凯蒂对“资本”的定义（“可以在某些市场上拥有和交换的非人类资产的总和”）使生产资本不再是中心，但重新审视了财富如何通过继承、避税、“慈善”及其他形式的赠与来保护和传递，所有这些在2010年代被政治化。社会科学家们很快填补了空白，进行了有关法律服务、“家族办公室”、精英学校和离岸信托的迷人研究，这些都使新寡头免受政治干预。
- en: Political-economic conflict now seemed less about class, in a Marxist sense,
    and more about intergenerational unfairness and the sheer luck of which family
    (with what sized “bank of mum and dad”) one happens to be born into. One of the
    remarkable implications of *Capital in the Twenty-First Century* is that, due
    principally to its very high levels of top marginal income and inheritance tax,
    the post-1945 Keynesian era is the one phase of capitalist history in which the
    promise of meritocracy has ever been close to being realised. By fiscally suppressing
    “R>G” for 30 years (and because so much capital had been destroyed by war), people
    were able to work their way towards wealth ownership. The baby-boomer generation
    that benefited from this was the same generation that would later benefit from
    surging house prices, pay off their modest mortgages, and vote for Brexit. It
    has taken a while to recognise how much societies such as Britain have been reshaped
    by long-run trends in asset ownership and asset prices, but *Capital in the Twenty-first
    Century* was a key moment in this awakening.

  zh: 政治经济冲突现在似乎不再仅仅关乎马克思主义意义上的阶级问题，更多地关乎代际不公和纯粹的运气，即一个人出生在哪个家庭（带有多大的“爸爸妈妈的银行”）。《二十一世纪资本论》的一个显著影响是，由于其非常高的最高边际收入和遗产税水平，战后的凯恩斯主义时代是资本主义历史上唯一一个接近实现技术精英主义承诺的阶段。通过在30年间财政上抑制“R>G”（因为大量资本被战争摧毁），人们能够逐步走向财富拥有。从中受益的婴儿潮一代后来也因房价飙升而受益，偿还了他们的简陋抵押贷款，并投票支持脱欧。要认识到像英国这样的社会在资产所有权和资产价格的长期趋势中发生了多大程度的重塑，花了一些时间，但《二十一世纪资本论》是这一觉醒的关键时刻。
