- en: For decades, I’ve cherished the 1933 comedy-drama “Man’s Castle” as a gem of
    classic Hollywood, and one that succeeds in uniting rare romantic refinement and
    harsh, Depression-scarred candor. It’s set mainly in a shantytown under a New
    York bridge, whose inhabitants include Bill (Spencer Tracy), a hard-nosed wanderer
    with boundless chutzpah, and Trina (Loretta Young), a starving yet steadfast ingénue
    to whom he gives shelter. (Trina and Bill quickly become a couple, and the movie’s
    central question is whether Bill, whose wanderlust is stoked by the sound of a
    train whistle, will stay put with Trina or hop a freight without her.) The movie
    balances a sharply etched view of poverty in the shadow of wealth with an attentiveness
    to the personalities and foibles of the shantytown dwellers. The keen wit and
    wry antics of the film’s director, Frank Borzage, match a deeply sympathetic tenderness
    for the characters’ strivings and vulnerabilities; “Man’s Castle” offers a vast
    vision of exaltation and degradation, and of the wild daring, even heroism, that
    is born of desperate circumstances.

  zh: 几十年来，我一直将1933年的喜剧剧情片《人的城堡》视为经典好莱坞的一颗明珠，成功地将罕见的浪漫精致与大萧条时期的坦率结合在一起。该片主要设定在纽约一座桥下的棚户区，居民包括比尔（斯宾塞·特雷西），一个粗鲁但充满胆量的流浪者，以及特丽娜（洛丽塔·杨），一个虽然饥饿但坚定不移的初出茅庐的少女，他给予她庇护。（特丽娜和比尔很快成为一对，电影的核心问题是比尔是否会因火车哨声的响起而留在特丽娜身边，还是离开她跳上一辆货车。）电影通过对贫困和富裕阴影下个性和缺点的细腻刻画来平衡观点。导演弗兰克·博尔扎奇（Frank
    Borzage）的机智和挖苦的戏剧性与对角色奋斗和脆弱的深切同情相匹配；《人的城堡》呈现了一种关于高尚和堕落的广阔视野，以及在绝望环境中诞生的狂野胆识，甚至英雄主义。
- en: However, the sixty-nine-minute film that I’ve been enjoying, recorded from a
    TCM broadcast long ago, is a drastic abridgment of the original, edited down and
    reissued by Columbia Pictures in 1938\. The studio wanted to rerelease the old
    picture to take advantage of Tracy’s burgeoning stardom, and therefore sought
    to bring it into line with the moral strictures of the Hays Code, a doctrine of
    self-censorship that Hollywood had adopted to ward off the threat of actual censorship.
    (The code was published in 1930, but the studios didn’t enforce it strictly until
    1934, the year after “Man’s Castle” came out.) In all, about eight minutes of
    risqué plot points and dialogue were cut, and my love of the movie has been accompanied
    by tantalized curiosity about what was missing.

  zh: 然而，我喜欢的这部长达六十九分钟的电影，是很久以前从TCM广播中录制的，是对原版的极大删减，由哥伦比亚影业在1938年编辑并重新发行。该工作室希望重新发行这部旧片以利用特雷西的日益兴起的明星地位，因此试图使其符合好莱坞为抵御实际审查威胁而采用的自我审查原则——海斯法典（Hays
    Code）。 （该法典于1930年发布，但直到1934年《人的城堡》上映后一年才严格执行。）总体而言，约有八分钟的挑逗性情节和对话被剪掉，而我对电影的喜爱伴随着对缺失部分的好奇心。
- en: Now, thanks to the diligent detective work of Rita Belda, an executive at Sony
    (the company that eventually bought Columbia), a seventy-eight-minute restoration
    of “Man’s Castle” has been painstakingly assembled, bringing the film close to
    the version that was originally released. It will be screened at *MOMA* from April
    18th to 24th along with a mini-retrospective of other recently restored works
    from the long career of Borzage, whose films are among the most original and thematically
    complex ones of classic Hollywood. (Belda will be on hand April 20th to discuss
    the restoration.) Even truncated and bowdlerized, “Man’s Castle” is a classic,
    but the restoration emphasizes all the more strongly the depth and power of Borzage’s
    vision—and the wit and style with which he brings it to light. The *MOMA* series
    as a whole offers viewers a chance to deepen their appreciation of a neglected
    filmmaker’s daring ideas.

    （贝尔达将于4月20日亲自到场讨论修复过程。）即便经过删减和删除敏感内容，《人的城堡》仍然是一部经典之作，但修复版本更加突出了波尔齐奇视觉深度和力量——以及他将其展示出来的机智和风格。整个*MOMA*系列为观众提供了深入欣赏被忽视电影制作人大胆构思的机会。
- en: Borzage’s very name is a sort of cinephile password—in the way that the pronunciation
    of “Houston Street” is for New Yorkers. His name is pronounced “bor-*zay*-ghy,”
    and the fact that it needs mentioning suggests that his name is not mentioned
    often enough. Born in Utah in 1894, to an Italian father and a Swiss mother, he
    started out as an actor and began to direct in 1913 (yes, as a teen-ager). He
    flourished in the silent era, and won the first ever Academy Award for Best Director,
    in 1929, for “7th Heaven” (a silent movie, to which synchronized music and sound
    effects, but no dialogue, were added). Three years later, having made the leap
    to talking pictures, he won again, for “Bad Girl.” Yet, though his career lasted
    nearly to his death, in 1962, he never again figured in the Oscars race. And if
    I needed to cite one movie that exemplifies his artistry and his world view, “Man’s
    Castle” would be it.

  zh: 波尔齐奇的名字本身就是一种电影爱好者的密码——就像纽约人说“休斯顿街”的发音一样。 他的名字的发音是“波尔-**齐**-ghy”，而且需要提到的事实表明他的名字并不经常被提及。
    1894年出生在犹他州，父亲是意大利人，母亲是瑞士人，他从事演员工作并于1913年开始执导。 他在默片时代蓬勃发展，并赢得了1929年的第一个奥斯卡最佳导演奖，《第七天堂》（一部默片，添加了同步音乐和音效，但没有对话）。
    三年后，他跨入有声电影，再次获奖，《坏女孩》。 然而，尽管他的职业生涯几乎延续到1962年去世，但他再也没有出现在奥斯卡的竞赛中。 如果我需要引用一部能体现他的艺术和世界观的电影，《人的城堡》将会是其中之一。
- en: 'For starters, there’s greatness in the playful but poignant touches through
    which Borzage tells the story. The very first scene is a meet-cute of misery:
    on a park bench, Bill, duded up in a tuxedo and a top hat, is feeding popcorn
    to pigeons; sitting next to him, Trina tries to find the courage to say that she
    hasn’t eaten in two days and could really use some popcorn herself. Instead, Bill,
    posing as a rich man, takes her to a fancy restaurant, only to reveal—after she
    eats a lavish dinner—that he has no money to pay for it. (He’s daring enough to
    get away with it, making a public scene with a sharply political point—and, of
    course, the scene of righteous indignation is, above all, Borzage’s.) Bill’s suit,
    it turns out, has an illuminated advertisement embedded in its shirtfront. It’s
    a kind of novelty sandwich board, with which Bill earns a bit of money by parading
    up and down the streets advertising a brand of coffee.'

    然而，比尔装扮成富人，把她带到一个高级餐馆，只是在她吃完了丰盛的晚餐之后才揭示出来——他没有钱支付。 （他足够大胆，可以逃脱，制造出有着尖锐政治观点的公众场面——当然，这个场面是波尔齐奇的。

- en: 'The sequence is filled with false clues and strange incongruities, but it’s
    only the first of many such twists that crop up throughout the movie. Bill’s romantic
    dilemma is put on decisive display by his miscues in a sandlot baseball game,
    and, later, a burglar gets distracted playing with toys made by the company he’s
    stealing from. In fact, such moments are a hallmark of Borzage’s work. His direction
    is the art of indirection, something borne out by other films in the *MOMA* retrospective.
    The Oscar-winning “Bad Girl” (1931)—the drama of a young couple whose married
    life is strained by poverty, secrecy, and mismatched dreams—opens with a wedding
    scene that turns out to be merely a fashion show. “History Is Made at Night” (1937),
    a rapturous romantic comedy of unlikely encounters and unlikelier reunions, involves
    an elaborately nested set of ruses: a man rescues a woman from sexual assault
    by rushing into a hotel room pretending to be a thief; afterward, returning the
    “stolen” items to her, he makes like a rich man, taking her to dinner at a fancy
    restaurant where he eventually turns out to be no patron but, rather, the headwaiter.
    Such indirections—involving gender, family, sex, and love—are more than mere whimsy.
    They embody Borzage’s vision of a far more cosmic paradox: his films are mainly
    romances, but they’re caustic and melancholy, suffused with pain and speeding
    toward doom.'

  zh: 这部影片充满了虚假线索和奇怪的不协调之处，但这只是其中一个复杂情节的开端。比尔在一个沙地棒球比赛中因错误而展示了他的感情困境，稍后一个盗贼在偷窃时被玩具分散了注意力，这些时刻实际上都是博尔扎奇作品的特点之一。他的导演手法充满了迂回曲折，其他在*现代艺术博物馆（MOMA）*回顾展中的电影也充分印证了这一点。奥斯卡获奖影片《坏女孩》（1931年）——讲述一对年轻夫妇因贫困、秘密和理想不合而婚姻生活承受压力——开篇是一个婚礼场景，结果只是一场时装秀。《夜晚制造历史》（1937年），一部充满奇遇和更奇异重逢的浪漫喜剧，涉及复杂交错的诡计：一个男人假扮小偷冲入旅馆房间，救了一个正遭受性侵的女人；事后他将“偷走”的物品还给她，假装自己是富豪，带她去了一家高级餐厅，最终却不是客人而是餐厅的首席服务员。这些迂回曲折涉及性别、家庭、性爱和爱情，不仅仅是一时兴起，它们体现了博尔扎奇对更宏大悖论的视角：他的电影主要是爱情片，但却充满了辛辣和忧郁，充满痛苦，走向灭亡。
- en: 'For Borzage, the greatest indirection is love. In his world view, doomed romanticism
    isn’t an oxymoron but a tautology: to experience love deep within one’s bones
    comes at the cost of one’s earthly comforts and worldly aspirations, even one’s
    life. Love in his films is frankly sexual: one of the first things that happens
    at the shantytown in “Man’s Castle” is that Bill and Trina go skinny-dipping together
    in the river, and one of the censored moments that has been restored shows their
    naked bodies in close contact. Strikingly, Borzage’s fervent lustiness is matched
    by a passionate Christianity. One character in “Man’s Castle” is a former minister
    now working as a night watchman, and one of the restored scenes shows Bill reading
    aloud to Trina from this man’s Bible. (The reading features steamy passages from
    the Song of Songs—presumably the reason that the scene got cut.)'

  zh: 对于博尔扎奇而言，最大的迂回便是爱情。在他的世界观中，命运多舛的浪漫主义并非矛盾修辞，而是同义反复：深刻体验爱情需要付出世俗舒适、世俗抱负甚至生命的代价。他的电影中爱情坦率而性感：在《人的城堡》的一个帐篷镇，比尔和特丽娜第一件事便是一起在河里裸泳，其中一段被修剪的镜头展示了他们赤裸的身体亲密接触。引人注目的是，博尔扎奇的热情和奋发向上与他的激情基督教信仰相辅相成。《人的城堡》中的一个角色是一名曾经的牧师，现在是夜间看门人，其中一场被修复的镜头显示比尔正在为特丽娜朗读他的圣经。（这段阅读包含了《雅歌》中充满热情的段落——很可能是这一场景被剪辑的原因。）
- en: Even when religion is less explicitly invoked, Borzage’s films are marked by
    a sense of spiritual devotion, in which romantic desire isn’t a contradiction
    of the spiritual but an incarnation of it—not least because, for Borzage, lust
    and consummation are inseparable from sacrifice and torment. Borzage presents
    sex with a candor rare in Hollywood at the time—an out-of-wedlock pregnancy in
    “Man’s Castle,” impulsive premarital sex in “Bad Girl”—but he films it with a
    glow of sacralizing purity. He’s the master of instantly kindled lust, as in a
    majestic, moonstruck scene of love at first sight in the melodrama “Living on
    Velvet” (1935), but agonies are built into these carnal extremes, which is what
    grants them a kind of innocence. Borzage is an artist of sublime agony. He excels
    in closeups of characters in a state of spiritual exaltation, which he tends to
    emphasize with expressive, unnatural lighting, the actors’ bodies sunk in shadow
    but their faces brightly lit as if the illumination were coming from within. The
    expressions on their faces present a pleasure that closely resembles pain.

  zh: 即使在宗教被明确提及较少的情况下，博扎吉的电影都充满了一种精神虔诚的感觉，在这种感觉中，浪漫的欲望并不是精神的对立，而是它的化身——尤其是因为对于博扎吉来说，欲望和实现是与牺牲和痛苦密不可分的。博扎吉在“人的城堡”中展现了一种在当时好莱坞罕见的坦率——一场婚前怀孕，一场冲动的婚前性行为在“坏女孩”中——但他用一种神圣的纯洁光辉来拍摄它们。他是瞬间引发的欲望的大师，就像在《生活在天鹅绒上》（1935年）的情感戏中那样，一场雄伟的、月光下的一见钟情的场景，但这些肉欲的极端中都包含了痛苦，这也是使它们具有某种纯真的原因。博扎吉是一位卓越的苦闷艺术家。他擅长拍摄处于精神升华状态的人物特写，通常用富有表现力、不自然的灯光来强调，演员们的身体深陷阴影，但他们的脸庞明亮得像是内心发出的光芒。他们脸上的表情呈现出一种极其接近痛苦的愉悦感。
- en: Such happy endings as Borzage grants his lovers are often bitterly ironic ones—tacked-on
    sequences that implausibly bring characters back from certain death. The end of
    “Living on Velvet” is so unreal as to seem posthumous; “History Is Made at Night”
    is a transatlantic romance that essentially gives the wreck of the Titanic a happy
    ending. “Moonrise” (1948), a violence-riddled romantic noir also playing at *MOMA*,
    adds to an implausibly miraculous survival a legalistic ending that, in the manner
    of “[Crime and Punishment](https://www.amazon.com/Crime-Punishment-Volokhonsky-Translation-Classics/dp/0679734503),”
    will separate its young lovers for years. Even when Borzage’s endings aren’t a
    matter of life and death, they’re a matter of renunciation. “Man’s Castle” ends
    with a transcendent, cosmic image—a sublime illusion achieved with a camera rising
    high—but meanwhile Bill and Trina are giving up their big dreams and preparing
    for a film-noir-ful of new troubles. “Bad Girl” ends with a crushing of big plans
    and a seeming life sentence of poverty; the ostensibly happy endings of a pair
    of Borzage’s great silent films, “The Circle” and “Lazybones” (both 1925), are
    built upon mountains of misery.

- en: The unity of Borzage’s vision is all the more remarkable for having been realized
    within the confines of the studio system—and for his having no overt hand in his
    films’ scripts. (He received only four writing credits, all for films made in
    1916.) Still, in many of his great films, including “Man’s Castle,” “Bad Girl,”
    and “Lazybones,” Borzage made sure that he got the last word—as producer, the
    person to whom the screenwriters reported. Seeing a bunch of Borzage films in
    a short period of time brings to the fore some themes that, noticeable and disturbing
    as they are in any one movie, emerge as the center of the director’s troubled
    and troubling world view. At the heart of this vision is women’s lot in life and

    newly restored scene features a woman with whom Bill is having an affair hinting
    that Trina can get an abortion: “That jam you’re in can be fixed,” she says. “There’s
    hardly anything money won’t fix.”) In the earlier film, a couple’s lives are thrown
    out of whack less by the woman’s pregnancy than by her fear of disclosing it to
    her husband, a poor but ambitious man who wants no children. In “Lazybones,” a
    secret maintained for years about the parentage of an adopted child destroys the

- en: 'Another dominant aspect of Borzage’s work is the depiction of male harassment
    of and violence against women as a direly epidemic fact of life. The semi-comedic
    tone of the films, this theme notwithstanding, suggests all the more just how
    commonplace such horrors are, and the sort of ordinary heroism it costs women
    to bear them with equanimity. In “Man’s Castle,” Bill, with his sharp talk, unleashes
    a long but unbroken skein of threats on Trina—such as to sock her on the chin,
    to knock out her teeth—that are meant to come off as affectionate: as they lovingly
    embrace, he pokes her sharply in the side and asks what she’d do if he punched
    her hard. (To a neighbor, Trina laughingly shows off bruises received at Bill’s
    hands, saying that he “doesn’t know his own strength.”) In “Bad Girl,” also set
    in New York, the sexual harassment endured by women at work and in the streets
    is so relentless that when the titular protagonist meets one man who *doesn’t*
    harass her, she’s suspicious of his motives (and then yearns to marry him). In
    “History Is Made at Night,” violence is part of a jilted husband’s scheme to deny
    his wife a divorce; in “The Circle,” a jilted husband saves his marriage by kidnapping

  zh: 博扎基作品的另一个主要特点是男性对女性的骚扰和暴力描绘为生活中的一种严重流行现象。尽管电影的半喜剧色调，但这一主题显示出这些恐怖事件是多么普遍，以及女性平静地忍受它们所需要的普通英雄主义。在《男人的城堡》中，比尔用尖刻的言语对特里娜施加了一连串的威胁——比如说要打她的下巴，打掉她的牙齿——意在显得充满爱意：当他们亲密拥抱时，他尖锐地戳了她一下，问她如果他狠狠地打她会怎么办。（特里娜笑着向邻居展示了比尔用手打她后留下的伤痕，说他“不知道自己的力气有多大。”）在《坏女孩》中，同样设定在纽约，女性在工作中和街上遭受的性骚扰是如此不间断，以至于当主人公遇到一个*不*骚扰她的男人时，她对他的动机感到怀疑（然后渴望嫁给他）。在《夜晚的历史》中，暴力是一个被抛弃的丈夫拒绝给妻子离婚的计划的一部分；在《圆》中，一个被抛弃的丈夫通过绑架妻子来挽救婚姻。

    career, running from 1923 to 1956, was roughly contemporaneous with Borzage’s—filmed
    so insistently the social burdens, pressures, and constraints endured by women,
    whether single or married or widowed, employed or not, rural or urban, poor or
    middle-class or rich. It’s here that Borzage manages to fuse his social vision
    with his religious one. The freedom of women is narrowed not only by men (and
    the social and political order established by men) but also by their own propensity
    for love—even the love of men who bear doom in their very being. For Borzage,
    the original sin of mankind—of male-kind, rather—is violence, and violence is
    inseparable from the ordinary run of daily activity at all levels of society.
    The minister turned watchman in “Man’s Castle” has to carry a gun to eke out his
    meagre living. Bill, in the attempt to earn his pittance, alternately takes a
    physical beating (during one howlingly outrageous day as a process server) and

    “7th Heaven,” a drama involving the First World War, and in “No Greater Glory”

    War “Lord of the Flies” in which boys in a Budapest neighborhood mimic the militarism
    of their elders in the plan to go to “war” to defend a vacant lot that’s the area’s
    one playground. “Moonrise” shows how a culture of violence passed down from father
    to son in a small Virginia town produces bullying abuses of power at a civic level.
    (The violence endured by Black people in such a town, where the Confederacy is
    still remembered fondly, finds expression in subplots involving a Black man named

  zh: 男性的原罪也涉及战争的暴力，如奥斯卡获奖影片《第七天堂》，这是一部涉及第一次世界大战的戏剧，《无上荣耀》（1934年）同样是*现代艺术博物馆*系列中的另一部影片。这类似于第一次世界大战后的《蝇王》，在其中布达佩斯一个社区的男孩们模仿他们的长辈的军国主义，计划“战斗”以保卫一个被遗弃的空地，这是该地区唯一的游乐场。《月光》展示了在一个小弗吉尼亚镇上，由父亲传给儿子的暴力文化如何在市民层面上产生欺凌和权力滥用。（在这样一个仍然怀念南方联盟的小镇上，黑人所忍受的暴力在涉及一个名叫雷克斯·英格拉姆的黑人男子——穆斯·杰克逊，他在城镇郊区一个废弃庄园的小屋里独居——的情节中得到了表现。）
