    there are several still surviving in the Old Town which date from the 17th century.
    A geographically constrained site, a more unruly countryside, and a land system

    higher, more dense development. Once these patterns were established in the Scottish
    capital, they became the norm in other Scottish cities as they developed, particularly
    as Scottish law from an early date enabled the purchase of parts of buildings,
    a notable difference with south of the border. The tenement became *the* urban
    housing form in Scotland, with similar facades hiding both grand middle-class
    apartments and overcrowded working-class rooms; there was much less distinction
    of housing by appearance. (As late as 1966, some 8 percent of all dwellings in
    England & Wales had been originally designed to share a common building; in Scotland
    the figure was 51 percent. Indeed, when Scotland did suburbanise, bungalows were
    unusually popular, reflecting the custom of one-storey living).'

- en: In contrast, English cities mostly lost their defensive function much earlier
    and suburbs with houses sprang up from the 18th century onwards. Many of these
    were developed on the great landed estates, such as Grosvenor and Bedford, which
    were often constrained in their ability to sell land by ‘strict settlement’. This
    aimed to prevent individual benefactors from selling land, to ensure the estate
    could be passed on to subsequent generations intact. This meant development proceeded
    by granting builders such as Thomas Cubitt a ‘building lease’ for a set period
    of time, after which the ownership would revert to the estate.

    Act, which laid out specific dimensions for houses in London and was responsible

    types combined with varying degrees of overcrowding may explain why later reformers
    were so obsessed with reducing density. (There is one exception to the terraced
    rule: in the North East, perhaps due to the proximity to Scotland, the ‘Tyneside
    flat’ and its variants emerged – effectively two apartments on top of each other

    growth of London which made more cost-effective central residences desirable.
    High land values may have been the overriding factor. The first ‘mansion block’
    was built in 1853 on Victoria Street, which had been newly laid out west of the
    Houses of Parliament, partly to clear the notorious Devil’s Acre slum that fell
    under the morning shadow of the Houses of Parliament and Westminster Cathedral.
    This had resulted in a number of plots becoming available for building. According

    of the century and the mid-1930s. The traditional source of investment in urban
    housing, the private landlord, had been kneecapped by the introduction and maintenance
    of wartime rent controls. The combination of high inflation and a sharp economic

- en: After Britain left the gold standard in 1931, interest rates fell from 6 to

    sheer scale of housing development in the home counties was raising some questions:
    buyers and developers were beginning to feel that the market might be saturated
    and on the verge of a crash. Builders’ pooling approach to mortgages, which reduced
    the need for a deposit from 25 percent to 5 percent of purchase price, was coming
    under scrutiny. In the early days of this system, builders would deposit 20 percent
    of the purchase price of each house with the building society; later, their bank
    would deposit an equivalent amount with the building society using the land value
    as security. The problem was that this practice was pushing up land prices (compared
    to if customers had required a 25 percent deposit) and the valuation was in any
    case provided by the builder. It would lead to scandals by the end of the decade.
