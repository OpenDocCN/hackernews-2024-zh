    that vest over time as part of their compensation. The shares incentivize employees
    to work hard and stay with the company in the hopes of big paydays. (Since TikTok
    owner ByteDance is not publicly traded, if employees want to cash in their stock
    shares, they most likely have to sell them back to the company.)

    questioned TikTok’s vague definition of disparagement by saying that it makes
    it difficult to know what the boundaries are. Furthermore, the legal landscape

    the National Labor Relations Board ruled that overly broad non-disparagement clauses
