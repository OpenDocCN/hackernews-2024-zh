    prison dairy went to BelGioioso Cheese, which makes Polly-O string cheese and
    other products that land in grocery stores nationwide like Whole Foods. A California
    prison provided almonds to Minturn Nut Company, a major producer and exporter.

    mozzarella cheesemaker Leprino Foods, which supplies major pizza companies like

    cash generators, largely because of the low overhead. In Alabama, for instance,
    the state brought in more than $32 million in the past five fiscal years after
    garnishing 40 percent of prisoners’ wages.
