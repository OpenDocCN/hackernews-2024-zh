    why sexuality is a taboo in all human societies: Among males of many different
    species, getting provoked by others having sex is adaptive. For example, among
    chimpanzees, the alpha male tends to be very jealous and does not tolerate that
    other males copulate with fertile females. Presumably he just detests the sight,

    are very much affected by culture. I see one reason to assume that the number
    of premarital sexual partners is not a very good proxy for a woman''s outlooks
    to become a faithful wife: Psychologist David Buss argues that women who have
    affairs tend to do so for strategic rather than emotional reasons. According to
    Buss, men who have affairs tend to be driven by a wish for sexual variety: they
    report no lower levels of marital satisfaction than men who do not have affairs.
