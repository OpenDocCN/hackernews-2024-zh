    any of the ones I signed because they all include clauses that say I can''t do
    that, but read your own in detail. Also keep in mind that overly broad NDAs are
    often set aside by courts, so if you act reasonably you will not be attracting
    legal or ethical jeopardy.]'

- en: Let's say as part of working on X you learned a true fact like "A is faster
    than B" or "these screws don't rust in the environment X is deployed in" or "you
    should sharpen your chisel every day when carving this stuff". If you, while working
    on Y, say "for X we used A because it is faster" you are revealing information
    about X and possibly breaking your NDA. But if you say "A is faster here" or "these
    screws don't rust in [seawater or whatever]" or "did you sharpen your chisel today?"
    you are not.

  zh: 假设在工作X的过程中，你学到了一个真实的事实，比如“A比B更快”或者“这些螺丝在X部署的环境中不会生锈”或者“你应该每天磨砺你的凿子来雕刻这些东西”。如果你在工作Y时说“对于X，我们使用A是因为它更快”，你正在揭示关于X的信息，可能违反你的保密协议。但如果你说“在这里A更快”或者“这些螺丝在[海水或其他地方]不会生锈”或者“你今天磨砺了你的凿子吗？”你就没有揭示X的信息。
- en: Most NDAs are much less enforceable than people think. They are often much less
    relevant also. Before something has been released, the information that it will
    have a particular feature is important and proprietary and should be protected.
    Once it's released, that is in the press release! Yes, other things stay secret
    indefinitely, but not every scrap of information you know qualifies.

  zh: 大多数保密协议没有人们想象中的那么可执行。它们通常也不那么相关。在某事发布之前，它将具有特定功能的信息是重要的和专有的，应该得到保护。一旦发布，这就在新闻发布会上了！是的，其他事情会永远保密，但并不是你所知道的每一小块信息都有资格。
- en: You should protect with the highest determination things like your old employer's
    future plans for X, the names and contact details of former fellow employees,
    the pricing and payment structures that were offered for X, what your fellow employees
    were paid, and other "inside details" of the business. You should also hold secret
    any super cool proprietary tricks that made X stand out from the rest - a different
    file format, a compression trick, something no one else has that made it somehow
    better in a way people didn't know the mechanics of. You can be pretty calm about
    having learned which sorting algorithm is faster, or the command line options
    for a commonly used product in your industry, or other things which are not so
    much "information about X" as they skills you have developed while working on
    X. To be "influenced by your knowledge of X" is not at all the same as "to tell
    people how X works internally."

  zh: 你应该以最高决心保护诸如你的老雇主关于X的未来计划，前同事的姓名和联系方式，X的定价和支付结构，你的同事们的薪水，以及业务的其他“内部细节”。你还应该保密X中突出表现的超酷专有技巧
    - 不同的文件格式，压缩技巧，或者别人没有的使其在某种方式上更好，但其机制不为人知的东西。你可以对已经学会的哪个排序算法更快，或者你行业中常用产品的命令行选项等比较镇定。这些不太是关于X的信息，而是你在X上工作时所发展的技能。被“受你对X知识的影响”并不等同于“告诉人们X是如何内部工作的”。
