    of foreign governments — and even ourselves — can make our blood boil. The way
    anger manifests varies, too. Anger is a punch, a scream, a red face, a silent
    brood, a river of tears. Anger is selfish (road rage) and selfless (protesting
    a war half a world away). This prickling, burning emotion — which can range from
    moderate irritation to complete rage — energizes us to come face-to-face with
    the wrongdoers, Martin says. When we’re angry, “our sympathetic nervous system
    activates our fight-or-flight response,” he says. “So our heart rate [is] increasing,
    our breathing increasing, and so on. That’s all a way to essentially give us the
    energy we need to fight back.”

    —— 从轻度的恼怒到完全的愤怒 —— 激励我们面对行为不当者，马丁说。当我们愤怒时，“我们的交感神经系统激活了我们的战斗或逃跑反应，”他说。“所以我们的心率增加，呼吸加快，等等。这一切本质上都是给我们提供我们需要的能量来反击。”

    at the guy who cut us off in traffic, lashing out at a customer service representative,
    leaving passive-aggressive notes for loud neighbors, seeking revenge against a
    friend who hurt us. Other times, we may repress anger and stew in silence. Anger
    can morph into despair: that a problem is so profound the only solution is more
    outrage. The consequences of unproductive anger can be damaging to personal relationships
    and professional reputations, and dangerous to those against whom revenge is sought.'

    something more benign. Did your mother-in-law criticize your cooking or did she
    simply comment on having had lasagna the last time you had her over for dinner?
    Was the test exceptionally difficult or were you unprepared? “You want how you’re

    out against their practices could have a material impact on their business. By
    informing your professional network of the client’s attitude toward contractors,
    the reputation of said client will spread, Parrott says, and people may be reluctant
