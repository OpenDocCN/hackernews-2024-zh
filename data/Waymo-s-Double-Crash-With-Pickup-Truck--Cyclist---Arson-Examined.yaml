    same pickup truck being towed in the center lane of a Phoenix street. As [reported
    to NHTSA](https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2024/RCLRPT-24E013-4528.PDF "https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2024/RCLRPT-24E013-4528.PDF"),
    the pickup was behind a tow truck, which had craned up the front, but its front
    wheels were on the ground. However, in an unusual (and Waymo says improper) fashion,
    the steering wheel on the truck was apparently locked to the right. The tow truck
    was moving in the shared center “left turn” lane, which is generally only for
    vehicles turning immediately left from either direction. Because of the turned
    front wheels, the dragged truck was twisting itself to the right, constantly putting
    its nose into the lane to the (tow truck’s) right of it, in which the Waymos were
    driving. The Waymo car touched the corner of the truck, but there was not significant
    damage and the tow truck continued on. “Several minutes” later another Waymo came
    along and made the same mistake.

  zh: 最有趣的是在凤凰城街道的中心车道上，Waymo自动驾驶汽车与同一辆拖曳在后的皮卡车角落相撞。据[NHTSA报告](https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2024/RCLRPT-24E013-4528.PDF)，这辆皮卡车位于一辆拖车后面，拖车已经抬起了前部，但前轮仍然着地。然而，以一种不寻常的（Waymo称之为不当的）方式，卡车的方向盘显然锁定在右侧。拖车在共享的中心“左转”车道上行驶，通常只适用于从任一方向立即左转的车辆。由于转向的前轮，被拖车不断地将自己扭向右侧，不断把车头伸入右侧的车道（拖车的右侧），Waymo汽车正在行驶其中。Waymo汽车碰到了卡车的角落，但没有造成重大损坏，而拖车则继续前行。几分钟后，另一辆Waymo汽车也犯了同样的错误。
- en: In Waymo’s favor, a tow truck should not have been towing like that, nor should
    it be driving for long in that center lane. Counter to that, however, is the fact
    that a human driver would be very unlikely to make the mistake the Waymo made.
    The robotic nature of the system is also evident in the fact a second Waymo made
    the same mistake.

- en: The most important part of any self driving car is the prediction engine, which
    tries to calculate where everything on the road is likely to go as we move into
    the future. Speculation suggests the Waymo prediction engine saw the orientation
    of the pickup truck, with wheels turned away, and incorrectly predicted it would
    head towards the lane it was being towed in. Waymo has declined to comment on
    the details of this, but there are two potential sources of a bad prediction.
    In one case, they might have not understood the pickup was being towed, and just
    viewed it as a truck incorrectly making an incursion into the Waymo’s lane, but
    clearly steering out of it into the left turn lane. Another, more likely error,
    would be that they identified the pickup as being towed, and predicted that it
    would trail behind the tow truck in the way this normally works. Towed vehicles
    can sway out, but they will return to following the tow vehicle quickly.

  zh: 任何自动驾驶汽车最重要的部分是预测引擎，它试图计算在未来移动时道路上每件事物可能的去向。推测表明，Waymo的预测引擎看到了皮卡的方向，轮子转向，错误地预测它将朝着它被拖曳的车道前进。Waymo拒绝就此发表评论的细节，但存在两个预测错误的潜在来源。在一种情况下，他们可能没有意识到皮卡正在被拖曳，只是将其视为卡车错误地侵入Waymo的车道，但显然向左转车道驶离。另一个更有可能的错误是，他们确认皮卡正在被拖曳，并预测它将会像通常的方式一样跟随拖车行驶。被拖曳的车辆可能会摆动，但它们会迅速返回跟随拖车。
- en: As such, I speculate that the Waymo predicted the pickup would quickly move
    to the center lane, and as such the Waymo could continue it its adjacent lane
    as the truck would be gone by the time it got there. It probably kept predicting
    that up until the time it was too close and it winged the pickup truck. Based
    on the crash description, it’s probable the tow truck driver didn’t even know
    this had happened, and so kept going, and then the 2nd Waymo to come along.

  zh: 因此，我推测Waymo预测皮卡会快速移动到中心车道，因此Waymo可以继续在邻近车道行驶，因为当卡车到达时，皮卡将不复存在。直到距离太近，它才轻轻碰到了皮卡。根据事故描述，拖车司机可能甚至不知道发生了这件事，所以继续前行，然后又有第二辆Waymo出现。
- en: Disturbingly for Waymo, there is an echo here to one of Cruise’s most famous
    crashes, where they drove right into the back of an articulated city bus in San
    Francisco. An articulated bus is effectively one vehicle being towed by another,
    and Cruise mistakenly programmed their car to ignore sensor data from the back
    of the bus, and instead predict where the back of the bus would be based on what
    the front was doing. Foolishly, Cruise did this even when the front of the bus
    was hidden, and so it had to guess where it was. It guessed wrong, as the bus
    was braking but the Cruise couldn’t see that. Well, it could see the back, but
    was ignoring it, and couldn’t see the front. That was a stupid bug, but more concerning
    was that no system was able to notice that the back of the bus was coming up fast
    and would be hit, which should have caused an emergency override of plan that
    was based on the wrong predictions.

  zh: 对Waymo来说，这里有一个令人不安的回声，与Cruise最著名的事故之一相似，他们在旧金山撞上了一辆关节公交车的后面。一个关节公交车实际上是一个车辆被另一个车辆拖动，而Cruise错误地编程他们的车忽略了从公交车后面的传感器数据，而是根据前面的行为预测公交车的后面会在哪里。愚蠢的是，即使公交车的前面被遮挡了，Cruise还是这样做了，所以它不得不猜测公交车的位置。它猜错了，因为公交车在刹车，但Cruise看不见。嗯，它可以看到后面，但却忽略了它，而且看不见前面。这是一个愚蠢的bug，但更令人担忧的是，没有系统能注意到公交车后面迅速靠近并会被撞击，这本应该引起基于错误预测的紧急重置计划。
- en: Cruise’s crash should have been an immediate red flag for Waymo to look more
    carefully at their code to handle vehicles being towed. If they did that, they
    missed a complete analysis of the ways that towed vehicles can act strangely.
    Since this is a rare situation, and involves improper towing, that might get missed.
    They also may have missed that bigger picture solution, which is to notice when
    sensor data says a prediction is more and more clearly wrong. That should have
    been drop-dead easy for Cruise, as their target was “the size of a bus.” For Waymo
    to get smarter about disagreements between sensor data and predictions is a more
    challenging task.

- en: The double crash is another thing that can happen to robots but not to humans.
    Normally, it’s a plus. When one robot makes a mistake, the team will immediately
    work to fix it, and within a few days, no robot will make that mistake again.
    But it won’t get fixed in a few minutes. That’s not generally trouble, because
    rare situations don’t repeat quickly, but they can when it’s literally the same
    vehicle or location. It could make sense for any crash to not just tag a location
    as risky, but a specific other vehicle or class of vehicle.

    and probability of repeat. This situation was unusual, in that it repeated within
    just a few minutes, but that’s because it was with the same vehicle. At the level

    for them to encounter entirely novel situations they can’t handle. After you drive
    for tens of millions of miles, anything never seen before is guaranteed to be
    something rare and unlikely, which is good. As such, even when an incident happens,
    it is not necessary to “shut down the fleet” out of fear it could happen again

    or vehicle which triggers an incident be immediately avoided by all other vehicles

- en: Most cyclists frequently roll through stop signs. It’s not legal (rolling is
    legal in some states but not if another road user has priority) but it’s probably
    more common than seeing one make a full stop. I’ve certainly done this. When you
    do it, you take on responsibility for the fact other road users may not expect
    you or may not even see you, and so you must be alert to make sure nobody else
    is going to intersect you—you will pay a far greater price if that happens. This
    cyclist appears to have failed at that. At the same time, it is interesting to
    ask if the Waymo driver could have done something to prevent the incident. Waymo
    has not commented, but they might have perceived the cyclist riding up behind
    the truck, and possibly noticed his “disappearance.” While it’s a reasonable assumption
    that a cyclist might roll through the stop, the unwritten rules of the road don’t
    readily allow this. If you assume there could be a cyclist behind every other
    large vehicle at a 4 way stop, you will be much too timid and impede traffic.
    If we presume the Waymo had no chance to see the cyclist before he approached
    the stop sign, it’s not clear a human driver could have avoided this situation.
    We don’t have information on the reaction times of the Waymo once the cyclist
    became visible to see if they could have done that better.
