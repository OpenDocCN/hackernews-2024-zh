- en: Apple’s new [DMA rules](https://techcrunch.com/2024/01/25/apple-dma-changes/)
    have been widely criticized by developers and tech companies, including [Meta](https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/01/mark-zuckerberg-calls-apples-dma-rules-so-onerous-he-doubts-any-developer-will-opt-in/),
    [Mozilla](https://techcrunch.com/2024/01/26/apple-dma-webkit/) and [Microsoft](https://mashable.com/article/meta-microsoft-lobby-eu-apple-app-store-dma).
    Instead of introducing a new, more level playing field where developers could
    easily compete with Apple’s App Store, Apple found a way to legally comply with
    the specifics of the regulation, but not its intention. Most notably, it introduced
    a Core Technology Fee for those developers adopting its DMA rules, which requires
    apps distributed outside the App Store to still pay Apple €0.50 for each first
    annual install per year over a 1 million threshold. This was bad news for would-be
    rivals that had wanted to set up their own app stores or distribute their apps
    outside of Apple’s walls to avoid paying commissions.

    it reads.
- en: The letter goes on to point out where the companies think that Apple is non-compliant
    with the DMA, noting that Apple’s system of requiring developers to choose to
    opt into the DMA terms adds unnecessary complexity and confusion, as both are
    non-compliant, it says. Plus, because of the new fee structure, and the Core Technology
    Fee, it’s clear that few will agree to the DMA terms, the companies said. While
    there has been much vocal criticism of the terms, at least one developer, MacPaw,
    recently announced it had accessed the terms to distribute its software subscription
    Setapp in the EU.

  zh: 信函继续指出了公司认为苹果在DMA方面不符合的地方，指出苹果要求开发者选择是否选择加入DMA条款的系统增加了不必要的复杂性和混淆。信中说，由于新的费用结构和核心技术费用，很明显很少有人会同意DMA条款。虽然对这些条款进行了大量的口头批评，但至少有一家开发者MacPaw最近宣布已经获取了在欧盟分发其软件订阅服务Setapp的条款。
- en: The companies also complain that Apple’s “scare screens,” designed to warn customers
    of the risks associated with transacting outside Apple’s App Store, will “mislead
    and degrade the user experience, depriving them of real choice and the benefits
    of the DMA.”

    for alternative app stores and sideloading — the former which the companies say
    Apple makes difficult and the latter which Apple’s DMA rules don’t even allow

    that outlines its solutions to address the changes the DMA requires to commissions
    and payments. Here, it stresses the security and trust customers have with Apple
    and its emphasis on consumer privacy. In short, its position is that “Users should
    not be exposed to physical harm through iOS,” and that all its efforts with regard
    to DMA compliance are means of reducing any potential harms that users could be
    exposed to.
