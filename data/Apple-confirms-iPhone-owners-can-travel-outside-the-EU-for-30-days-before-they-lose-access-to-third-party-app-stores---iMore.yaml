- en: Apple's iOS 17.4 software update was released earlier this week and among other
    things, it enabled support for third-party app stores in EU member countries.
    Dubbed "alternative app marketplaces" by Apple, access to these third-party app
    stores is mandated by the new Digital Markets Act in the European Union, but no
    such requirement exists outside of the bloc. As a result of that, Apple took the
    decision to only enable alternative app marketplaces in the EU, leaving those
    elsewhere to use the [App Store](https://www.imore.com/how-download-apps-and-games-your-iphone-and-ipad).
    But it isn't quite that simple.

  zh: 本周早些时候发布了苹果的 iOS 17.4 软件更新，其中支持了在欧盟成员国家的第三方应用商店。苹果称之为“替代应用市场”，根据欧盟的新数字市场法案规定，这些第三方应用商店的访问是强制性的，但在欧盟之外没有这样的要求。因此，苹果决定只在欧盟内启用替代应用市场，其他地方仍需使用[App
    Store](https://www.imore.com/how-download-apps-and-games-your-iphone-and-ipad)。但事情并非那么简单。
- en: As part of Apple's enabling of support for such marketplaces, it requires that
    users have an EU Apple ID while the iPhone has to physically be in an EU country
    as well. That's to ensure that people in other parts of the world can't gain access
    to third-party app stores by pretending to be in the EU, and it's a stance that
    isn't wholly surprising. However, the requirement for an EU GPS fix does potentially
    raise issues — like when people go on vacation.

  zh: 作为苹果支持此类市场的一部分，要求用户在 iPhone 位于欧盟国家时必须使用欧盟 Apple ID。这是为了确保世界其他地区的人不能通过假装在欧盟境内来访问第三方应用商店，这一立场并不奇怪。然而，需要欧盟
    GPS 位置固定可能会带来问题——比如当人们去度假时。
- en: Apple had previously said that it would give EU citizens a period of graze for
    which third-party app stores would continue to work even when they left the EU,
    but it hadn't clarified how long that period would be. That has today changed,
    with some clarification offered in an updated [support document](https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=23432X820453&xcust=im_us_1561366818289953883&xs=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fsupport.apple.com%2Fen-us%2F118110&sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.imore.com%2Fiphone%2Fapple-confirms-iphone-owners-can-travel-outside-the-eu-for-30-days-before-they-lose-access-to-third-party-app-stores)

- en: The updated document confirms that in order for alternative app marketplaces
    to be available "the country or region of your Apple ID must be set to one of
    the countries or regions of the European Union, and you must physically be located
    in the European Union." Apple notes that "device eligibility for alternative app
    marketplaces is determined using on-device processing with only an indicator of
    eligibility sent to Apple," adding that "to preserve your privacy, Apple does
    not collect your device's location."

- en: '"If you leave the European Union, you can continue to open and use apps that
    you previously installed from alternative app marketplaces," Apple begins. "Alternative
    app marketplaces can continue updating those apps for up to 30 days after you
    leave the European Union, and you can continue using alternative app marketplaces
    to manage previously installed apps."'

  zh: “如果您离开欧盟，可以继续打开和使用您先前从另类应用市场安装的应用，”苹果开始解释道。“另类应用市场可以在您离开欧盟后继续为这些应用更新30天，并且您可以继续使用另类应用市场来管理之前安装的应用。”
- en: That all seems unlikely to cause too many issues, but there's a caveat. "However,
    you must be in the European Union to install alternative app marketplaces and
    new apps from alternative app marketplaces," Apple warns. That appears to suggest
    that as soon as an EU citizen leaves the EU, they won't be able to install anything
    outside of the App Store. Whether or not that will be something the European Commission
    takes issue with, remains to be seen. After all, an EU citizen is an EU citizen
    even *after* they leave the EU.

  zh: 所有这些都不太可能造成太多问题，但还有一个*警告*。 “但是，您必须身处欧盟才能安装另类应用市场和来自另类应用市场的新应用，”苹果警告说。这似乎表明，一旦欧盟公民离开欧盟，他们就无法安装App
    Store之外的任何东西。欧洲委员会是否会对此提出异议，尚待观察。毕竟，即使*在*他们离开欧盟后，欧盟公民仍然是欧盟公民。
