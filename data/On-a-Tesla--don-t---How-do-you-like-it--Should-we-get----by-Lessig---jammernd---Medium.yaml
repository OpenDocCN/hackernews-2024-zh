    (in some places at least) they have become as common as mud. (I was in Palo Alto
    last year. It seemed every other car was a Tesla). But in small part, among some,

    Sometimes (maybe 10% of the time), the car will recognize that you are trying

    or a setting has been reset). It then gives you the option to allow the Tesla
    to park itself. But no one uses this function more than once (or twice, after
    giving the car the benefit of the doubt the first time). You press the function,
    and the car takes forever to calculate how to place itself between two other cars
    that are themselves not moving. It starts and then stumbles, pausing to recalculate.
    The process takes *forever*, during which time you should think: So this is how
    effectively it navigates two stationary cars while moving at less than ten mph.
