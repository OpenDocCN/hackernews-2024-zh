  zh: 世界经济论坛年会上，[生成式人工智能（AI）革命](https://english.elpais.com/science-tech/2023-11-30/trusting-chatgpt-helps-to-improve-it.html)的非凡潜力和巨大风险成为了讨论的主要焦点。尼克·克莱格（Nick
    Clegg）和全球事务总裁、Meta首席AI科学家杨·勒均（Yann LeCun）在与包括《西班牙国家报》在内的五家国际媒体记者会上分享了他们对此事的看法。
- en: Meta — Facebook’s parent company — is one of the companies at the center of
    the revolution. This is due to both Meta’s notable capacity in this specific sector,
    and because it goes hand in hand with the enormous power granted by the control
    of massive social media platforms. In recent years, Meta has faced serious criticism
    and accusations over how it manages its social networks, with critics warning
    of their detrimental impact on democracy.

  zh: Meta — Facebook的母公司 — 是这场革命的中心之一。这既是因为Meta在这一特定领域的显著能力，也是因为它与控制大型社交媒体平台所带来的巨大权力密不可分。近年来，Meta因其社交网络的管理方式而面临严重的批评和指责，批评者警告其对民主的不利影响。
- en: 'In the conversation, LeCun emphasizes that “contrary to what you might hear
    from some people, we do not have a design for an intelligent system that would
    reach human intelligence.” The expert believes that “asking for regulations because
    of [fear of superhuman intelligence](https://english.elpais.com/technology/2024-01-05/fear-is-not-an-argument-for-rejecting-artificial-intelligence.html)
    is like asking for regulation of transatlantic flights at near the speed of sound
    in 1925.” He explains: “Human-level AI is not just around the corner. This is
    going to take a long time. And it’s going to require new scientific breakthroughs
    that we don’t know of yet.” That’s why LeCun thinks it’s premature to legislate
    AI thinking that the technology could get out of human’s control. The [European
    Union passed the world’s first AI legislation in December](https://english.elpais.com/international/2023-12-09/europe-reaches-a-deal-on-the-worlds-first-comprehensive-ai-rules.html),
    and other countries, such as the United States and the United Kingdom, are also
    working on specific laws to control this technology.'

  zh: 在对话中，勒均强调：“与一些人的说法相反，我们没有一个能达到人类智能的智能系统的设计。” 这位专家认为“因为[担心超人类智能](https://english.elpais.com/technology/2024-01-05/fear-is-not-an-argument-for-rejecting-artificial-intelligence.html)，就要求立法是像在1925年要求对超音速飞行的大西洋航线进行监管一样的。”
    他解释道：“人级AI不会立刻出现。这需要很长时间。而且需要我们尚不知道的新科学突破。” 这就是为什么勒均认为现在立法监管AI认为这项技术可能失控还为时过早。[欧盟在12月份通过了世界上首个AI立法](https://english.elpais.com/international/2023-12-09/europe-reaches-a-deal-on-the-worlds-first-comprehensive-ai-rules.html)，其他国家，如美国和英国，也在制定具体法律来控制这项技术。
- en: Clegg, for his part, is calling on the lawmakers who deal with the issue around
    the world to regulate products, but not research and development. “The only reason
    why you might think it would be useful to regulate research and development is
    if you believe in this fantasy of AI systems taking over the world, or being intrinsically
    dangerous,” says Clegg, who is a former British deputy prime minister and the
    ex-leader of the Liberal Democrats in the U.K.

- en: Both Clegg and LeCun are pleased that, after the commotion following the arrival
    of ChatGPT, public debate has moved away from apocalyptic hypotheses and focused

    and that fools us into thinking that they are intelligent, but they are not that
    intelligent,” explains LeCun. “It’s not as if we’re going to be able to scale
    them up and train them with more data, with bigger computers, and reach human
    intelligence. This is not going to happen. What’s going to happen is that we’re
    going to have to discover new technology, new architectures of those systems,”

    would allow those systems to, first of all, understand the physical world, which

- en: “This is not around the corner,” insists LeCun. The scientist believes that
    this path “will take years, if not decades. It’s going to require new scientific
    breakthroughs that we don’t know of yet. You might wonder why the people who are

- en: The expert explains that there are currently systems that can pass the bar test,
    but cannot clear the table or throw the trash out. “It’s not because we can’t
    build a robot. It’s because we can’t make them smart enough. So obviously, we’re
    missing something big before we can reach the type of intelligence we observe,
    not just in humans, but also in animals. I’d be happy if, by the end of my career
    [he is 63 years old], we have systems that are as smart as a cat or something

- en: With respect to regulation, Clegg — who was a Member of the European Parliament
    — avoids making a definitive statement on the matter, but does have some sharp
    rebukes for the EU. “It is still a work in progress. It was a very classic EU
    thing. There is fanfare, it is said that something has been agreed upon, but in

- en: “For example, when it comes to data transparency in these models, everyone agrees,”
    Clegg continues. “But what level of transparency? Is it the data sets? Is the
    individual bits of data? Or, for example, in copyright. We have existing copyright
    legislation in the EU. Is it just going to limit that? Or is a new specific layer
    going to be added? When these models are trained, a huge amount of data is devoured.
    You wouldn’t be able to tag every single bit of data for IP reasons. It just wouldn’t
    be practical. So I think the devil really will be in the detail. We’ll look at
    it.”

    get a little bit frustrated that in Brussels they seem to pride themselves on
    being the first to legislate rather than on whether the legislation is any good
    or not. Remember the EU-AI Act was initially proposed by the European Commission
    three and a half years ago before the whole generative AI thing [like ChatGPT]
    erupted. And then they tried to retrofit, through a series of amendments, provisions
    to try and capture the latest evolution in technology. That’s quite a clumsy way
    of making legislation, retrofitting for something as important as generative AI.”'

- en: 'The debate between establishing protections and ensuring development is the
    source of strong tensions, both in politics and between politics and the private
    sector. In that subtle line that legislators have to draw, there is incalculable
    value at stake: productivity, jobs, capabilities that will define the balance

    have been, I think sensibly, asking MEPs and the European Commission to be really
    careful not to put something into legislation which will really hinder European
    competitiveness. Because of the 10 biggest companies in the world, not a single
    one is European.” On the other hand, a group of experts called on the EU, in an
    open letter published by EL PAÍS, for even stronger legislation “to protect the
    rights of European citizens and European innovation.”
