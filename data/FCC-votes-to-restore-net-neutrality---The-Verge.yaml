  zh: 联邦通信委员会以3比2的投票结果恢复了网络中立性规则，这反转了特朗普政府推行的废除。
- en: Net neutrality is the idea that internet service providers (ISPs) should not
    be able to discriminate against different kinds of content by blocking or throttling
    connection speeds or offering paid prioritization for different internet traffic.
    The FCC has sought to accomplish this by reclassifying ISPs as common carriers
    under Title II of the Communications Act, giving the agency more regulatory authority
    over them.

  zh: 网络中立性是指互联网服务提供商（ISP）不应通过阻断或限制连接速度或提供不同互联网流量的有偿优先级来区别对待不同类型内容的理念。FCC通过将ISP重新分类为通信法第二章的普通运营商，以增加对它们的监管权，来实现这一目标。
- en: Democratic FCC Chair Jessica Rosenworcel said in remarks ahead of the vote that
    internet access went from a “nice to have, to need to have.” She added, “Broadband
    is now an essential service. Essential services, the ones we count on in every
    aspect of modern life, have some basic oversight.”

  zh: 民主党FCC主席杰西卡·罗森沃塞尔在投票前的讲话中表示，互联网接入已经从“可有可无”变成“必须有”。她补充道：“宽带现在是一项基本服务。基本服务是我们在现代生活的各个方面都依赖的服务，应当受到一定的监管。”
- en: While ISPs generally say they don’t breach the principles of net neutrality,
    they object to the reclassification, in large part because it could give the FCC
    the ability to regulate their pricing. In this case, the FCC has decided to forbear
    rate regulation as it relates to the ISPs, though a future iteration of the agency
    could undo that with another regulatory proceeding.

  zh: 尽管ISP通常表示他们不违反网络中立性的原则，但他们反对重新分类，主要因为这可能使FCC有能力监管他们的定价。在这种情况下，FCC决定放弃对ISP定价的管制，尽管未来该机构可能会通过另一项管制程序撤销这一决定。
- en: The FCC introduced net neutrality rules in 2015 after a large grassroots effort.
    But they were undone in 2017 when Trump-appointed Ajit Pai led the commission
    and helped to repeal them. In the meantime, states have stepped in with their
    own net neutrality laws, which advocates say have kept the ISPs at bay. But the
    industry claims that the lack of change in that period indicates that federal
    rules are unnecessary and fear they will impede investments in innovation.

  zh: FCC在大规模基层努力之后，于2015年引入了网络中立性规则。但在特朗普任命的阿吉特·派领导下，这些规则在2017年被废除。与此同时，各州推出了自己的网络中立性法律，倡导者称这些法律使得ISP保持了适度的行为。但行业声称，在此期间法律没有变化表明联邦规则是不必要的，并担心这将阻碍创新投资。
- en: Though much of the FCC’s order echoes that of 2015, the agency’s rhetoric and
    justifications have been somewhat updated. Rosenworcel has argued that the rules
    will give the agency greater oversight of internet outages and will close a critical
    loophole in its authority to address telecommunications companies that pose national
    security risks by barring them from offering internet services on top of other
    communications services.

  zh: 尽管FCC的命令很大程度上重复了2015年的规定，但该机构的言论和理由已经有所更新。罗森沃塞尔认为，这些规则将使机构能够更好地监督互联网中断，并通过禁止具有国家安全风险的电信公司提供互联网服务来填补其管理漏洞。
- en: FCC Commissioner Brendan Carr, a Republican who staunchly opposes the agency
    taking up net neutrality through Title II reclassification, argued during the
    agency’s open meeting that the move is a symptom of a larger issue. He said the
    maneuver is an example of how judicial deference to federal agency authority in
    cases where the law is ambiguous has incentivized the executive branch to engage
    in “pressure campaigns” to have agencies do their bidding.

  zh: 共和党人和强烈反对FCC通过第二章重新分类来处理网络中立性的FCC委员布兰登·卡尔在机构的公开会议上辩称，这一举动是更大问题的一个症状。他表示，这种做法表明，在法律模糊的情况下，法院对联邦机构权力的推崇，已经激励行政部门进行“压力运动”，迫使机构执行他们的命令。
- en: He also argued that the FCC’s rate regulation forbearance is not legitimate,
    comparing it to the authority used by the Education Department to get rid of student
    debt that was struck down. “The FCC does not presume to have the sweeping power
    to refashion Title II into an entirely new legislative scheme by picking and choosing
    which parts to apply,” he said. “The FCC throws whatever it can think of against
    the wall to see if anything sticks.”

  zh: 他还争辩说，FCC的费率管制免除不合法，将其比作教育部用来清除被废止的学生债务的权限。“FCC并不假设有权利通过挑选应用哪些部分来重新塑造第二标题成一个全新的立法方案”，他说。“FCC把它能想到的所有东西扔到墙上，看看哪些会粘上去。”
- en: Democratic Commissioner Geoffrey Starks, who supported the rules, said he’s
    not concerned about how courts will evaluate the vote, saying the FCC’s authority
    to apply Title II to broadband providers is “clear as day.” He added that he opposes
    rate regulation of ISPs but disagrees with the notion that any affordable internet
    program can be construed as rate regulation. Starks called for a “permanent funding
    mechanism” for the Affordable Connectivity Program, which has provided internet
    subsidies for low-income consumers since the covid pandemic. The program is quickly

  zh: 支持这些规则的民主党委员杰弗里·斯塔克斯说，他不担心法院如何评估投票结果，称FCC将第二标题适用于宽带提供商的权力“昭然若日”。他补充说，他反对对ISP的费率管制，但不同意任何经济适用的互联网项目都可以被解释为费率管制。斯塔克斯呼吁为“可负担的连通性计划”建立一个“永久资金机制”，该计划自covid大流行以来为低收入消费者提供互联网补贴。如果国会未能延长该计划，该计划将很快[资金用完](/2024/4/5/24121022/universal-broadband-access-fcc-usf-acp)。
