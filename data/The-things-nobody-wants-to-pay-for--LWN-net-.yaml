    worth, by most estimates, many billions of dollars; all of this code is freely
    available to anybody who wants to use or modify it. It is an unparalleled example
    of independent actors working cooperatively on a common resource. Free software
    is certainly a success story, but all is not perfect. One of the community's greatest
    strengths — convincing companies to contribute to this common resource — is also
    part of one of its biggest weaknesses.

- en: The GNU project, as described by Richard Stallman in the 1985 [GNU Manifesto](https://www.gnu.org/gnu/manifesto.en.html),
    looked hopelessly ambitious at the time. To many of us, it seemed that only large
    companies could build operating systems, and that a group of volunteers would
    never be able to aspire to such a goal. The volunteers got surprisingly far, to
    the point that, less than ten years after the GNU Manifesto was published, running
    a system on only free software (or something close to that) was possible. It was
    an impressive achievement.

  zh: GNU项目是由Richard Stallman在1985年的[GNU宣言](https://www.gnu.org/gnu/manifesto.en.html)中描述的，当时看起来似乎是无望的野心勃勃。对我们许多人来说，似乎只有大公司才能构建操作系统，自愿者组成的团队永远无法追求这样的目标。这些志愿者进展得出人意料的顺利，以至于在GNU宣言发表不到十年后，只用自由软件（或接近）运行的系统就成为可能了。这是一个令人印象深刻的成就。
- en: Even then, though, that software not entirely devoid of corporate contributions.
    The X Window System, for example, was the product of a commercial consortium that
    predated Linux. The development of GCC was pushed forward by companies like Cygnus
    Computing. When the Linux kernel arrived on the scene, there was indeed a substantial
    body of GNU software that could run on it, but there was a nontrivial amount of
    company-contributed software as well.

  zh: 即便如此，这些软件并非完全没有公司的贡献。举例来说，X 视窗系统是早期在Linux之前由商业联盟创建的。GCC的发展也得到了像Cygnus Computing这样的公司的推动。当Linux内核出现时，已经有相当多的GNU软件可以在其上运行，但也有相当数量的公司贡献的软件。
- en: Linux in the 1990s still lagged far behind the proprietary Unix systems in many
    ways, even though it was better in others. That began to change with the arrival
    of corporate funding, which supercharged development on Linux and on free software
    in general. Without it, we would not have the system we take for granted today.
    Companies, working in their own interest, have built up our body of free software
    hugely; it is almost as if this capitalism thing actually works.

  zh: 在1990年代的Linux在很多方面仍远远落后于专有的Unix系统，尽管在其他方面更为优秀。而公司的资金到来改变了这一点，加速了Linux和自由软件的发展。没有这些，我们今天所理所当然地拥有的系统根本不会有。公司在自身利益下的工作极大地构建了我们的自由软件体系；这几乎就像资本主义真的起作用一样。
- en: The problem, of course, is that these companies have a tendency to interpret
    their own self-interest rather narrowly. They will happily pay to develop a driver
    for a hardware product, but they are less interested in supporting the maintainership
    and review that are needed to integrate that driver, the development of the subsystem
    into which the driver fits, or the support the driver will need over the years.
    Companies pay for thousands of developers to work on the kernel, but none pays
    for a single technical writer to create documentation. Work that is not seen as
    contributing to short-term revenue tends not to get much attention in the corporate
    world.

  zh: 当然，问题在于，这些公司往往倾向于狭隘地解释自己的利益。他们乐意为硬件产品开发驱动程序付费，但对于支持维护和审查所需的资源分配、驱动程序适配的子系统开发以及未来几年内驱动程序所需的支持就不那么感兴趣了。公司会为成千上万的开发人员支付工资，但没有一家公司愿意支付单独的技术撰写人员来创建文档。在企业界，那些不被视为对短期收益有贡献的工作往往不会得到太多关注。
- en: There are, needless to say, numerous other pathologies exhibited by corporations
    in the open-source community. These include license violations, free-riding, throwing
    code over the wall, and more. Projects that are controlled by a single company

    at the level that we would like. But the fact of the matter is that the LF is
    about the only entity that has supported this work *at all*; without that support,

    is a good thing to do, it is also worth asking why no other company has seen fit
    to support that work, despite the fact that they have all benefited from it. The

    that this version of the distribution will not support packages like KDE or Thunderbird

    confirmed by SUSE. Such a move would seem similar to Red Hat's [decision to drop

- en: Have you ever wondered why KDE was deprecated in RHEL? It wasn't just because
    KDE Plasma 5 was so big that they couldn't make the jump for RHEL 8, it was also
    because people were not paying for RHEL for the desktop, so they had no budget
    for more people. It happened again with the layoffs at Red Hat last year. SUSE

    But, seemingly, that path toward making money is more elusive in the desktop realm;
    those of us who are using desktop Linux are not generally paying for the privilege,
