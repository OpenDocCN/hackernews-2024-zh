- en: So far this year I’ve been writing about (or around) a way of working that the
    French philosopher Gilles Deleuze once called “[the](https://masoncurrey.substack.com/p/deleuze-and-guattari-in-flux)
    *[flux](https://masoncurrey.substack.com/p/deleuze-and-guattari-in-flux)*.” He
    was describing what happened when he and the psychoanalyst Félix Guattari tried
    writing together—it was, he said, “like two streams coming together to make a
    third stream, which I suppose was us.”

  zh: 今年到目前为止，我一直在写（或围绕着）法国哲学家吉尔·德勒兹（Gilles Deleuze）曾称之为“[流动](https://masoncurrey.substack.com/p/deleuze-and-guattari-in-flux)”的一种工作方式。他描述了他与精神分析师菲利克斯·瓜塔里（Félix
    Guattari）尝试共同写作时发生的情况——他说，那就像是两条流水汇合形成第三条流水，我想那就是我们吧。
- en: I really like this idea, and [last time](https://masoncurrey.substack.com/p/celine-sciamma-screenwriting-process)
    I proposed a method for—perhaps—creating “the flux” in an individual practice.
    For *this* issue—well, up until the end of last week I didn’t know what I was
    going to write about; I figured I’d move onto a new topic. But then an old friend
    emailed me out of the blue, and in our email exchange he mentioned *Deadwood*
    creator David Milch’s writing process, which involves him lying on the floor in
    a roomful of people and dictating to a typist.

  zh: 我非常喜欢这个想法，[上次](https://masoncurrey.substack.com/p/celine-sciamma-screenwriting-process)我提出了一个或许能在个人实践中创造“流动”的方法。至于*这*期刊——嗯，在上周末之前，我不知道我将要写些什么；我本来以为我会进入一个新的主题。但是，一位老朋友突然给我发了封电子邮件，在我们的邮件交流中，他提到了*Deadwood*的创作者David
    Milch的写作过程，其中包括他躺在满屋子人的地板上，向打字员口述。
- en: 'I’ve never actually watched *Deadwood*—and I’ve maybe seen one or two episodes
    of *NYPD Blue*, the show that Milch worked on for seven seasons before that—but
    who could resist this image of the writer on the floor, dictating to a roomful
    of people? So I did some digging around, and wouldn’t you know it: Milch’s process
    actually feels like yet another expression of this idea of “the flux.”'

  zh: 我从未真正观看过*Deadwood* ——在那之前，我可能只看过*NYPD Blue*的一两集，那是Milch在此之前工作了七季的节目——但是谁能抗拒住这位作家坐在地板上，向满屋子的人们口述的这个画面呢？所以我进行了一些调查，你知道吗：Milch的创作过程实际上感觉上又是这种“流动”的另一种表达方式。
- en: 'Here’s how it worked on *NYPD Blue* and, later, *Deadwood*: Milch would lie
    on the floor in the middle of a room in the show’s writing trailer, with other
    writers and producers sitting in chairs around him. In front of Milch would be
    a computer monitor displaying the script in progress. On the other side of the
    monitor, a typist sat at a desk (with his or her own monitor), typing the script
    as Milch dictated it. These writing sessions thus came to resemble a kind of séance,
    with Milch summoning the voices of the characters, inventing their lines on the
    spot—and reciting variations of these lines over and over (and over and over)
    until he arrived at the exact right piece of dialogue.'

  zh: '*NYPD Blue*和稍后的*Deadwood*的工作方式如下：Milch会躺在剧组的写作车间里的地板上，周围是其他编剧和制片人坐在椅子上。Milch面前是一台显示进行中剧本的计算机显示器。在显示器的另一侧，一名打字员坐在桌子前（他或她也有自己的显示器），当Milch口述时，打字员会将剧本打出来。因此，这些写作会话看起来就像一场降灵术，Milch召唤角色的声音，即兴发明他们的台词——并且一遍又一遍（一遍又一遍）地重复，直到他找到确切合适的对白。'

- en: I find that I function most effectively when I sort of disembody myself. I lie
    there on the floor and I talk and the words come up on the screen and then I fix
    the words, but I never actually lay my hands on anything, a computer or a typewriter,

    video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHLtOKlHBFI) about the show. “It was a
    two-and-a-third-page scene. He spent *five hours* rewriting that scene. I swear,

- en: Why put his colleagues through this with him? For Milch, it is an adaptation
    born of necessity. He suffers from obsessive-compulsive disorder, and being alone
    in a room—and especially operating a computer by himself—simply offers too many
    opportunities for getting derailed by repetitive behaviors. “I’ve come to recognize
    that the more isolated I am, the more disposed I am to obsessive processes,” Milch
    has said. “I find that by writing out in the open, I am less likely to, for example,
    begin to write the same sentence a thousand times, or hang upside-down like a
    bat in the corner of the room, you know, or smoke crack.”

  zh: 为什么要让他的同事和他一起做这件事？对于米尔奇来说，这是出于必要的适应。他患有强迫症，独自呆在一个房间里——尤其是自己操作电脑——会导致过多重复行为的机会。“我已经认识到，我越是孤立，我就越容易陷入强迫过程中，”米尔奇说。“我发现，当我在公开场合写作时，比如说，开始写同样的句子一千遍，或者像蝙蝠一样倒挂在房间的角落里，或者吸大麻之类的，这些情况就少了。”
- en: 'He’s not joking about writing the same sentence a thousand times: Before he
    got involved in television, Milch had a book deal that he finally had to let lapse
    because, he said, “I went through a six-month period where every day I rewrote
    the same twelve pages almost word for word.”'

    that this is *fun* for him. He enjoys having an audience, and he enjoys the high-wire
    act of it. (“It was an audience, but it was also a fellowship of the spirit,”
    Milch writes in his memoir.) In that behind-the-scenes video I mentioned, a writer-producer

  zh: 因此，大声朗读，在满屋子的人面前写作，是他对抗最坏冲动的一种方式。但也正如观看米尔奇工作的片段所显示的那样，对他来说这是*乐趣*。他享受有观众，也享受这种高空走钢丝的感觉。（“这是一个观众，但也是精神的伙伴关系，”米尔奇在他的回忆录中写道。）在我提到的幕后视频中，一位《荒野镇》的编剧制片人说：
- en: I think he’s a genius because he’s solved a huge problem, which is that writing
    is really lonely. And it’s brutal to sit down and be by yourself and write. He
    eliminated it, first, by the dictation, by having the typist. And now he’s totally
    eliminated it by having a roomful of people. It’s a hell of a lot more fun than
    sitting alone in a room and feeling depressed.

  zh: “我认为他是个天才，因为他解决了一个巨大的问题，那就是写作真的很孤独。独自坐下来写作真的很残酷。他通过口述，通过有打字员来解决了这个问题。现在他完全通过有满屋子的人来解决了。这比独自一人坐在房间里感到沮丧要有趣得多。”
- en: 'Another key part of Milch’s process: When he’s not actually lying on the floor
    doing his dictation, he doesn’t think about the writing. He believes you should
    only write when you’re writing; otherwise you should put it out of your head entirely.
    “I try to consciously frustrate the impulse to think about a scene before I sit
    down to it,” Milch said in [a 2005](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2005/02/14/the-misfit-2)
    *[New Yorker](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2005/02/14/the-misfit-2)* [profile](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2005/02/14/the-misfit-2),

    can only act your way to right thinking.”'

  zh: Milch 的创作过程的另一个关键部分：当他实际上不是躺在地板上进行口述时，他不会去想写作。他认为你只有在写作时才应该写作；否则你应该完全把它从头脑中排除。“我试图有意识地阻止在坐下来写之前想象一个场景的冲动，”Milch
    在 [2005 年](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2005/02/14/the-misfit-2) 的 *[纽约客](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2005/02/14/the-misfit-2)*
    [简介](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2005/02/14/the-misfit-2) 中说道，并引用了据说是由戒酒匿名会创始人比尔·威尔逊所说的一句话（以不同的形式）：“你不能用思维来找到正确的行动；你只能通过行动找到正确的思维。”
- en: When I first encountered that saying, in [a memoir](https://bookshop.org/a/2391/9780143113072),
    maybe fifteen years ago, it kind of blew my mind. I am continually trying to think
    my way to right action—trying to cajole or bully or pep-talk myself into accomplishing
    the tasks that I’ve set for myself. And it doesn’t work! Or it does work, but
    it requires an expenditure of willpower that is unreasonable and maybe impossible
    to sustain over the long haul. But *acting your way to right thinking*—how do
    you actually do that? I guess I’m interested in Milch, and [Deleuze and Guattari](https://masoncurrey.substack.com/p/deleuze-and-guattari-in-flux),
    and [Céline Sciamma](https://masoncurrey.substack.com/p/celine-sciamma-screenwriting-process),
    because they seem to offer examples of how to do it—how to act your way into,
    if not *right* thinking, then *interesting* thinking, unexpected connections,
    and the kind of solutions that you can’t come up with by sheer willpower, sitting
    alone in a room with just your own thoughts.

  zh: 当我第一次在 [一本回忆录](https://bookshop.org/a/2391/9780143113072) 中遇到这句话，大约十五年前，它真的让我印象深刻。我不断地试图通过思考来找到正确的行动——试图用哄骗、欺凌或鼓励自己完成我为自己设定的任务。但这行不通！或者它行得通，但这需要一种无法持续的意志力投入，也许是不合理的。但是*通过行动找到正确的思维*——你实际上该怎么做呢？我想我对
    Milch、[德勒兹与瓜塔里](https://masoncurrey.substack.com/p/deleuze-and-guattari-in-flux)，以及
    [塞琳·西亚玛](https://masoncurrey.substack.com/p/celine-sciamma-screenwriting-process)
    感兴趣，因为它们似乎提供了如何做到这一点的例子——如何通过行动进入，即使不是*正确*的思维，也是*有趣*的思维，意想不到的联系，以及你无法仅凭意志力坐在一个房间里靠自己的想法想出的解决方案。
