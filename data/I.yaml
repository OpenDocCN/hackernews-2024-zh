    Huxley[[1](#f1)] gave such publicity in his Belfast address; which the late Mr.
    D. A. Spalding punctiliously made the pivot of all his book-notices in *Nature;*
    which Prof. Clifford fulminated as a dogma essential to salvation in a lecture
    on "Body and Mind"[[2](#f2)] but which found its earliest and ablest exposition
    in Mr. Hodgson's magnificent work, *The Theory of Practice*.[[3](#f3)] The theory
    maintains that in everything outward we are pure material machines.  Feeling is
    a mere collateral product of our nervous processes, unable to react upon them
    any more than a shadow reacts on the steps of the traveller whom it accompanies.  Inert,
    uninfluential, a simple passenger in the voyage of life, it is allowed to remain
    on board, but not to touch the helm or handle the rigging.

    感觉只是我们神经过程的一个简单的附带产物，无法对它们产生任何影响，就像影子对随行者的脚步所产生的影响一样。 惰性的，无影响力的，生命旅程中的一个简单的乘客，它被允许停留在船上，但不能触摸舵或操作索具。

    awaken each other by inward congruity or rational necessity, that disappointed
    hopes *cause* sadness, premisses conclusions, &c.  The feelings are merely juxtaposed
    in that order without mutual cohesion, because the nerve-processes to which they
    severally correspond awaken each other in that order. [p. 2]

- en: It may seem strange that this latter part of the theory should be held by writers,
    who Like Prof. Huxley have openly expressed their belief in Hume's doctrine of
    causality.  That doctrine asserts that the causality we seem to find between the
    terms of a physical chain of events, is an illegitimate outward projection of
    the inward necessity by which we feel each thought to sprout out of its customary
    antecedent.  Strip the string of necessity from between ideas themselves, and
    it becomes hard indeed for a Humian[*sic*] to say how the notion of causality
    ever was born at all.

  zh: 这个理论的后半部分被持有，可能看起来很奇怪，这些作者，像赫胥黎教授一样，公开表示他们相信休谟的因果论。 该理论断言，我们似乎在一个物理事件链中的术语之间找到的因果关系，是我们感觉到每一个思想都从其惯常的前因而萌发出来的内在必然性的一个非法外在投射。
    剥夺思想之间必要性的联系，对于一个休谟主义者来说，确实很难说因果关系的概念是如何产生的。
- en: This, however, is an *argumentum an hominem* which need not detain us.  The
    theory itself is an inevitable consequence of the extension of the notion of reflex
    action to the higher nerve-centres.  Prof. Huxley starts from a decapitated frog
    which performs rational-seeming acts although probably it has no consciousness,
    and passing up to the hemispheres of man concludes that the rationality of their
    performances can owe nothing to the feelings that co-exist with it.  This is the
    inverse of Mr. Lewes's procedure.  He starts from the hemispheres, and finding
    their performances apparently  guided by feeling concludes, when he comes to the
    spinal cord, that feeling though latent must still be there to make it act so
    rationally.  Clearly such arguments as these may mutually eat each other up to
    all eternity.

  zh: 然而，这是一个*人向人争辩*，不必让我们耽搁。这个理论本身是将反射动作的概念扩展到更高级别的神经中枢的必然结果。赫胥黎教授从一个斩首的青蛙开始，虽然可能没有意识，但却做出理性的行为，然后上升到人类的大脑半球，得出结论认为其表现的理性性质与共存的感觉无关。这与Lewes先生的做法相反。他从大脑半球开始，发现它们的表现显然受到感觉的指导，当他来到脊髓时，他得出结论，感觉虽然潜在，但必须仍然存在才能使其行动如此理性。显然，这样的论证可能彼此相互消耗到永远。
- en: 'The reason why the writers we speak of venture to dogmatise as they do on this
    subject, seems due to a sort of philosophic faith, bred like most faiths from
    an aesthetic demand.  Mental and physical events are, on all hands, admitted to
    present the strongest contrast in the entire field of being. The chasm which yawns
    between them is less easily bridged over by the mind than any interval we know.  Why
    then not call it an absolute chasm? And say not only that the two worlds are different,
    but that they are independent? This gives us the comfort of all simple and absolute
    formulas, and it makes each chain homogeneous to our consideration. When talking
    of nervous tremors and bodily actions, we may feel secure against intrusion from
    an irrelevant mental world. When, on the other hand, we speak of feelings, we
    may with equal consistency use terms always of one denomination, and never be
    annoyed by what Aristotle calls "slipping into another kind". The desire on the
    part of men educated in laboratories not to have their physical reasonings mixed
    up with such incommensurable factors as feelings is certainly very strong. Nothing
    is commoner than to hear them speak of conscious events as something so essentially
    vague and shadowy as even doubtfully to exist at all.  I have heard a most intelligent
    [p. 3] biologist say: "It is high time for scientific men to protest against the
    recognition of any such thing as consciousness in a scientific investigation".  In
    a word, feeling constitutes the "unscientific" half of existence, and any one
    who enjoys calling himself a "scientist" will be too happy to purchase an untrammeled
    homogeneity of terms in the studies of his predilection, at the slight cost of
    admitting a dualism which, in the same breath that it allows to mind an independent
    status of being, banishes it to a limbo of causal inertness, from whence no intrusion
    or interruption on its part need ever be feared.'

  zh: 我们所谈论的作家之所以如此坚定地对这个问题做出断言，似乎是由于一种类似于大多数信仰的美学需求所滋生的哲学信念。在所有方面，心理和物理事件都被认为是整个存在领域中最强烈的对比。它们之间的鸿沟不像我们所知的任何间隔那样容易被思维跨越。那么，为什么不称之为绝对的鸿沟呢？不仅说两个世界是不同的，而且说它们是独立的？这给了我们所有简单和绝对公式的安慰，并使每个链条在我们考虑中都是同质的。当我们谈论神经颤动和身体行为时，我们可能会对来自无关的精神世界的干扰感到安全。另一方面，当我们谈论感觉时，我们可能会一贯地使用始终为一种命名的术语，从来不会被亚里士多德称为“滑入另一种”的干扰所困扰。受过实验室教育的人们不愿将他们的物理推理与感情等无法相比较的因素混为一谈的愿望无疑是非常强烈的。听到他们将意识事件称为一种如此模糊而难以确切存在的事物是再普遍不过了。我曾听到一位非常聪明的生物学家说：“科学家们是时候抗议在科学研究中承认任何意识这样的事物了。”一言以蔽之，感觉构成了存在的“非科学”部分，任何一个喜欢称自己为“科学家”的人都会非常乐意以稍微承认一个使心灵独立存在的双重性而换取他所偏爱研究的领域中术语的无约束的同质性，而这只需付出一点点代价，即承认这种双重性将心灵驱逐到一种因果惰性的虚无之地，从而永远不会担心它会进行任何干扰或中断。

- en: If we take the actions of lower animals and the actions of lower ganglia in
    higher animals, what strikes us most in them is the determinateness with which
    they respond to a given stimulus.  The addition of the cerebral hemispheres immediately
    introduces a certain incalculableness into the result, and this incalculableness
    attains its maximum with the relatively enormous brain-convolutions of man.  In
    the beheaded frog the legs twitch as fatally when we touch the skin with acid
    as do a jumping-jack's when we pull the string.  The machinery is as narrow and
    perfect in the one case as in the other.  Even if all the centres above the cord
    except the cerebral hemispheres are left in place, the machine-like regularity
    of the animal's response is hardly less striking.  He breathes, he swallows, he
    crawls, he turns over from his back, he moves up or down on his support, he swims
    and stops at a given moment, he croaks, he leaps forward two or three times --
    each and all with almost unerring regularity at my word of command, provided I
    only be an experienced physiologist and know what ganglia to leave and what particular
    spur will elicit the action I desire. Thus if I merely remove his hemispheres
    and tilt my hand down, he will crawl up it but not jump off. If I pinch him under
    the arm-pits, he will croak once for each pinch; if I throw him into water, he
    will swim until I touch his hands with a stick, when he will immediately stop.  Over
    a frog with an entire brain, the physiologist has no such power.  The signal may
    be given, but ideas, emotions or caprices will be aroused instead of the fatal
    motor reply, and whether the animal will leap, croak, sink or swim or swell up
    without moving, is impossible to predict.  In a man's brain the utterly remote
    and unforeseen courses of action to which a given impression on the senses may
    give rise, is too notorious to need illustration.  Whether we notice it at all
    depends on our mental pre-occupations at the moment.  If we do notice it, our
    [p. 5] action again depends on the "considerations" which it awakens, and these
    again may depend as much on our transient mood or on our latest experience as
    on any constant tendencies organised in our nature.

  zh: 如果我们观察低等动物的行为以及高等动物中较低的神经节的行为，最引人注目的是它们对特定刺激作出的确定性反应。大脑半球的加入立即为结果引入了一定的不可计算性，而这种不可计算性在相对巨大的人类大脑卷曲中达到了最大值。在被斩首的青蛙身上，当我们用酸触碰皮肤时，腿部会像拉弦的跳跳人一样不可避免地抽搐。这个机器在两种情况下的狭窄和完美是一样的。即使除了大脑半球之外的所有中枢都留在原处，动物反应的机械般规律性仍然令人印象深刻。他呼吸，他吞咽，他爬行，他从背面翻转过来，他在支撑物上上下移动，他游泳并在给定的时刻停下来，他呱呱叫，他向前跳动两三次——每一次都几乎准确无误地按照我的命令进行，只要我是一位经验丰富的生理学家，并且知道应该留下哪些神经节和哪些特定的刺激会引发我所期望的动作。因此，如果我只是去除了他的大脑半球并向下倾斜我的手，他会顺着手爬上来但不会跳下来。如果我在腋窝下掐他，他会对每一次掐叫一次；如果我把他扔进水里，他会一直游泳直到我用棍子触摸他的手时，他会立即停下来。对于一个完整的大脑的青蛙，生理学家没有这样的权力。信号可以发出，但会引起思想、情绪或反复无常的动作，而不是致命的运动回应，动物将会跳跃、呱呱叫、沉没、游泳或膨胀而不动，这是不可能预测的。在人脑中，感官的给定印象可能引发完全偏离和意想不到的行动路径是太为人熟知而无需说明的。我们是否注意到它完全取决于我们当时的精神所占据的位置。如果我们确实注意到了，我们的行动又取决于它唤起的“考虑”，而这又可能与我们当时的心情或最近的经验一样多，也可能与我们天性中的任何固有倾向一样多。
- en: We may thus lay it down as an established fact that the most perfected parts
    of the brain are those whose action are least determinate.  It is this very vagueness
    which constitutes their advantage.  They allow their possessor to adapt his conduct
    to the minutest alterations in the environing circumstances, any one of which
    may be for him a sign, suggesting distant motives more powerful than any present
    solicitations of sense. Now it seems as if certain mechanical conclusions should
    be drawn from this state of things.  An organ swayed by slight impressions is
    an organ whose natural state is one of unstable equilibrium. We may imagine the
    various lines of discharge in the cerebrum to be almost on a par in point of permeability
    -- what discharge a given small impression will produce may be called accidental,
    in the sense in which we say it is a matter of accident whether a rain-drop falling
    on a mountain ridge descend the eastern or the western slope.  It is in this sense
    that we may call it a matter of accident whether a woman's first child be a boy
    or a girl.  The ovum is so unstable a body that certain causes too minute for
    our apprehension may at a certain moment tip it one way or the other. The natural
    law of an organ constituted after this fashion can be nothing but a law of caprice.  I
    do not see how one could reasonably expect from it any certain pursuance of useful
    lines of reaction such as the few and fatally determined performances of the lower
    centres constitute within their narrow sphere.  The dilemma in regard to the nervous
    system seems to be of the following kind. We may construct one which will react
    infallibly and certainly, but it will then be capable of reacting to very few
    changes in the environment -- it will fail to be adapted to all the rest. We may,
    on the other hand, construct a nervous system potentially adapted to respond to
    an infinite variety of minute features in the situation; but its fallibility will
    then be as great as its elaboration.  We can never be sure that its equilibrium
    will be upset in the appropriate direction.  In short, a high brain may do many
    things, and may do each of them at a very slight hint.  But its hair-trigger organisation
    makes of it a happy-go-lucky, hit-or-miss affair. It is as likely to do the crazy
    as the sane thing at any given moment. A low brain does few things, and in doing
    them perfectly forfeits all other use. The performances of a high brain are like
    dice thrown for ever on a table.  Unless they be loaded, what chance is there
    that the highest number will turn up oftener than the lowest? [p. 6]

    presuppose some Good, End or Interest to be the animal's. Until this goal of his
    salvation be posited, we have no criterion by which to estimate the utility of
    any of his reactions. Now the important thing to notice is that the goal cannot
    be posited at all so long as we consider the purely physical order of existence.  Matter
    has no ideals.  It must be entirely indifferent to the molecules of C, H, N and
    O, whether they combine in a live body or a dead one.  What the present conditions
    fatally necessitate that they do with equal infallibility and cheerfulness; whether
    the result of their action be the perfume of a rose or the odour of carrion, the
    words of a Renouvier or the crackling of thorns under a pot, it is brought forth
    with as little reluctance in the one case as in the other.  Good involves the
    notion of less good, necessitates comparison, and for a drop of water either to
    compare its present state with an absent state or to compare its total self with
    a drop of wine, would involve a process not commonly thought of as physical.  Comparison
    requires a *tertium* *quid,* a locus -- call it what you will -- in which the
    two outward existences may meet on equal terms. This forum is what is known as
    a consciousness. Even sensations cannot be supposed, simply as such, to be aware
    of their relations to each other.  A succession of feelings is not (as James Mill
    reiterates) one and the same thing with a feeling of succession, but a wholly
    different thing.  The latter feeling requires a self-transcendency of each item,
    so that each not only *is* in relation, but knows its relation, to the other.
    This self-transcendency of data constitutes the conscious form.  Where we suppose

    by calling consciousness a discriminating activity -- an *Unterscheidungsvermgen*.

    becomes aware of in its objects.  They pre-exist and consciousness only discerns
    them; so that after all Ulrici's definition amounts to little more than saying
    that consciousness is a faculty of cognition -- a rather barren result.  I think
    we may go farther and add that the powers of cognition, discrimination and comparison
    which it possesses, exist only for the sake of something beyond themselves, namely,
    Selection.  Whoever studies consciousness, from any point of view whatever, is
    ultimately brought up against the mystery of *interest* and *selective attention.*

- en: 'Helmholtz says we only use our sensations as *signs.* The sensations from which
    we avert our attention are those which are valueless as tokens of the presence
    of objective things. These *things* are called the Objects of perception. But
    what are *they?* Nothing, as it seems to me, but groups of coherent sensations.  This
    is no place to criticise Helmholtz''s treatment of perception, but I may say,
    in passing that I think his rather indefinite and oracular statements about the
    part played by the intellect therein have momentarily contributed to retard psychological
    inquiry.  We find the Kantian philosophers everywhere hailing him as the great
    experimental corroborator of their master''s views.  They say he has proved the
    present sensation to have nothing to do with the construction of the Object that
    is an original act of the intellect which the sensation merely instigates but
    does not furnish forth: it contains ultra-sensational elements.  All that Helmholtz
    really *does* prove is, that the so-called Object is constituted of *absent* sensations.  What
    he has not explicitly noticed is, that among these the mind picks out certain
    particular ones to be more essential and characteristic than the rest.  When,
    for example, on getting a peculiar retinal sensation with two acute and two obtuse
    angles, I *perceive* a square table-top, which thus contradicts my present image;
    what is the *squareness*but one out of an infinite number of possible retinal
    sensations which the same object may yield?  From all these the mind, for sthetic
    reasons of its own, has singled out this one and chosen to call it the object''s
    essential attribute?  Were room here given, I think it might be shown that perception
    involves nothing beyond association and selection.  The antithesis is not, as
    Helmholtz''s admirers would have it, between sensations on the one hand as signs
    and original intellectual products, materially different from [p. 11] sensations
    on the other, as Objects.  It is between present sensations as signs and certain
    absent sensations as Objects, these latter being moreover arbitrarily selected
    out of a large number as being more objective and real than the rest.  The real
    form of the circle is deemed to be the sensation it gives when the line of vision
    is perpendicular to its centre -- all its other sensations are signs of this sensation.  The
    real sound of the cannon is the sensation it makes when the ear is close by.  The
    real colour of the brick. is the sensation it gives when the eye looks squarely
    at it from a near point, out of the sunshine and yet not in the gloom; under other
    circumstances it gives us other colour-sensations which are not signs of this
    -- we then see it looks pinker or blacker than it really is.  The reader knows
    no object which he does not represent to himself by preference as in some typical
    attitude, of some normal size, at some characteristic distance, of some standard
    tint, &c., &c.  But all these essential characteristics, which together form the
    genuine objectivity of the thing and are contrasted with the subjective sensations
    we may happen to get from it at a given moment, are themselves sensations pure
    and simple, susceptible of being fully given at *some* other moment.  The spontaneity
    of the mind does not consist in conjuring up any new non-sensational quality of
    objectivity.  It consists solely in deciding what the particular sensation shall
    be whose native objectivity shall be held more valid than that of all the rest.[[7](#f7)]'

    in our given theoretical or practical emergency, may lead to the proper conclusion.  Another

    be theoretical, "means" if it be *practical-transfixed* upon it? Association by

    things into their elements.  But this association is only the minimum of that
    same selection of which picking out the right reason is a maximum.  I here confine

- en: Looking back then over this review we see that the mind is at every stage a
    theatre of simultaneous possibilities.  Consciousness consists in the comparison
    of these with each other, the selection of some, and the suppression of the rest
    by the reinforcing and inhibiting agency of attention.  The highest and most elaborated
    mental products are filtered from the data chosen by the faculty next beneath
    out of the mass offered by the faculty below that, which mass in turn was sifted
    from a still larger amount of yet simpler material, and so on.  The highest distillate
    thus *represents* in the last analysis nothing but sensational elements. But this
    is far from meaning that it implies nothing but passive faculty of sensation.  As
    well might one say that the sculptor is passive, because the statue stood from
    eternity within the stone.  So it did, but with a million different ones beside
    it.  The world as a Goethe feels and knows it all lay embedded in the primordial
    chaos of sensations, [p. 14] and into these elements we may analyse back every
    thought of the poet.  We may even, by our reasonings, unwind things back to that
    black and jointless continuity of space and moving clouds of swarming atoms which
    science calls the only real world.  But all the while the world we feel and live
    in, will be that which our ancestors and we, by slowly cumulative strokes of choice,
    have extricated out of this, as the sculptor extracts his statue by simply rejecting
    the other portions of the stone.  Other sculptors, other statues from the same
    stone! Other minds, other worlds from the same chaos!  Goethe's world is but one
    in a million alike embedded, alike real to those who may abstract them. Some such
    other worlds may exist in the consciousness of ant, crab and cuttle-fish.

  zh: 回顾这篇评论，我们看到心灵在每个阶段都是一个同时存在各种可能性的剧场。意识就在于比较它们，选择一些，通过注意力的增强和抑制作用来压制其余的。最高和最精细的心理产品是从下面的大量数据中经过下一层次的能力选择出来的，而这些数据又是从下一层次的能力提供的大量材料中筛选出来的，依此类推。因此，最高级的精华在最后分析中仅仅是感觉元素。但这远非意味着它意味着被动的感知能力。就像有人可能说雕塑家是被动的，因为雕像永远镌刻在石头中一样。确实如此，但旁边还有数百万个不同的雕塑。正如歌德所感受到和所知道的世界全部都深藏在感觉的原始混沌中一样，我们可以将每一个诗人的思想分解成这些元素。甚至我们可以通过推理将事物解开到科学所称的唯一真实世界的黑暗和无缝连续的空间以及游动的云团中去。但与此同时，我们感受和生活的世界将是我们的祖先和我们通过缓慢积累的选择，从这种混沌中抽取出来的世界，就像雕塑家通过简单地拒绝石头的其他部分而提取他的雕像一样。同一块石头，其他雕塑家，其他雕像！相同混沌中的其他心灵，其他世界！歌德的世界只是其中一个，在那些能够抽象它们的人看来都是一样深藏，一样真实的。在蚂蚁、螃蟹和乌贼的意识中可能存在着某种类似的其他世界。
- en: After this perhaps too long analysis let us now look back. We have found that
    the unaided action of the cerebral hemispheres would probably be random and capricious;
    that the nerve-process likely to lead to the animal's interests would not necessarily
    predominate at a given moment. On the other hand, we have found that an impartial
    consciousness is a non-entity, and that of the many items that ever occupy our
    mental stage Feeling always selects one as most congruous with the interests it
    has taken its stand upon.  Collating these two results, an inference is unavoidable.
    The "items" on the mental stage are the subjective aspects of as many nerve-processes,
    and in emphasising the representations congruous with conscious interest and discouraging
    all others, may not Attention actually reinforce and inhibit the nerve-processes
    to which the representations severally correspond?

- en: The hypothesis we are advocating might, if confirmed, considerably mitigate
    one of the strongest objections to the credibility of the Darwinian theory.  A
    consciousness which should not only determine its brain to prosperous courses,
    but also by virtue of that hereditary influence of habit  (nowadays so generally
    believed in by naturalists) should organise from generation to generation a nervous
    system more and more mechanically incapable of wandering from the lines of interest
    chosen for it at first, would immensely shorten the time and labour of natural
    selection.  Mr. Darwin regards animated nature as a sort of table on which dice
    are continually being thrown. No intention presides over the throwing, but lucky
    numbers from time to time fortuitously turn up and are preserved.  If the ideas
    we have advanced concerning the instability of a complicated cerebrum be true,
    we should have a sort of extension of this reign of accident into the functional
    life of [p. 16] every individual animal whose brain had become sufficiently evolved.  As
    his body morphologically was the result of lucky chance, so each of his so-called
    acts of intelligence would be another; and ages might elapse before out of this
    enormous lottery-game a brain should emerge both complex and secure. But give
    to consciousness the power of exerting a constant pressure in the direction of
    survival, and give to the organism the power of growing to the modes in which
    consciousness has trained it, and the number of stray shots is immensely reduced,
    and the time proportionally shortened for Evolution. It is, in fact, hard to see
    how without an effective superintending ideal the evolution of so unstable an
    organ as the mammalian cerebrum can have proceeded at all.

- en: That consciousness should only be intense when nerve-processes are retarded
    or hesitant, and at its minimum when nerve-action is rapid or certain, adds colour
    to the view that it is efficacious.  Rapid, automatic action is action through
    thoroughly excavated nerve-tracks which have not the defect of uncertain performance.  All
    instincts and confirmed habits are of this sort. But when action is hesitant there
    always seem several alternative possibilities of nervous discharge.  The feeling
    awakened lay the nascent excitement of each nerve-track seems by its attractive
    or repulsive quality to determine whether the excitement shall abort or shall
    become complete. Where indecision is great, as before a dangerous leap, consciousness
    is agonisingly intense.  Feeling, from this point of view, may be likened to a
    cross-section of the chain of nervous discharge, ascertaining the links already
    laid down, and groping among the fresh ends presented to it for the one which
    seems best to fit the case.

- en: There is yet another set of facts which seem explicable by the supposition that
    consciousness has causal efficacity. It has long been noticed that pleasures are
    generally associated with beneficial, pains with detrimental, experiences.  All
    the fundamental vital processes illustrate this law. Starvation, suffocation,
    privation of food, drink and sleep, work when exhausted, burns, wounds, inflammation,
    the effects of poison, are as disagreeable as filling the hungry stomach, enjoying
    rest and sleep after fatigue, exercise after rest, and a sound skin and unbroken
    bones at all times, are pleasant. Mr. Spencer, in the chapter of his *Psychology*
    entitled "Pleasures and Pains," has suggested that these coincidences are due,
    not to any pre-established harmony, but to the mere action of natural selection
    which would certainly kill off in the long run any breed of creatures to whom
    the *fundamentally* noxious experience seemed enjoyable.  An animal that should
    take pleasure in a suffocation would, if that pleasure were efficacious make him
    immerse his head in water, enjoy a longevity of four or five minutes.  But if
    pleasures and pains have no efficacity, one does not see (without some such *[*sic*]
    *priori* rational harmony as would be scouted by the "scientific" champions of
    the Automaton-theory) why the most noxious acts, such as burning, might not give
    a thrill of delight, and the most necessary ones, such as breathing, cause agony.[[9](#f9)]  The
    exceptions to this law [p. 18] are, it is true, numerous, but relate to experiences
    that are either not vital or not universal.  Drunkenness, for instance, which
    though noxious is to many persons delightful, is a very exceptional experience.  But,
    as the excellent physiologist Fick remarks, if all rivers and springs ran alcohol-instead
    of water, either all men would hate it or our nerves would have been selected
    so as to drink it with impunity.  The only very considerable attempt, in fact,
    that has ever been made to explain the *distribution* of our feelings is that
    of Mr. Grant Allen in his suggestive little work *Physiological sthetics;* and
    his reasoning is based exclusively on that causal efficacity of pleasures and
    pains which the "double-aspect" partisans so strenuously deny.*

  zh: 有另一组事实似乎可以通过假设意识具有因果效力来解释。人们早就注意到，快乐通常与有益的经历相关联，痛苦则与有害的经历相关。所有基本的生命过程都遵循这个规律。饥饿、窒息、食物、饮料和睡眠的匮乏，精疲力竭时的工作，烧伤，伤口，炎症，毒药的影响，都是令人不快的，就像填饱饥饿的胃，疲劳后享受休息和睡眠，休息后锻炼，以及随时保持健康的皮肤和完整的骨骼一样令人愉快。斯宾塞先生在他的《心理学》一章中提出了这个观点，名为“快乐与痛苦”，他认为这些巧合并不是由于任何预先确立的和谐，而是由于自然选择的简单作用，长期来看，这种本质上有害的经历看起来令人愉快的动物肯定会灭绝。一个喜欢窒息的动物，如果那种快乐是有效的，会让他把头浸入水中，享受四五分钟的长寿。但是如果快乐和痛苦没有效果，人们不会明白（没有一些像“科学”的自动机理论的“科学”冠军所嘲笑的*先验*的理性和谐），为什么最有害的行为，比如烧伤，可能不会带来愉悦的快感，而最必要的行为，比如呼吸，可能会引起痛苦。这个法则的例外确实很多，但涉及到的经历要么不重要，要么不普遍。例如，醉酒，尽管有害，对许多人来说却是一种非常特殊的经历。但是，正如出色的生理学家费克所指出的，如果所有河流和泉水都流着酒精而不是水，要么所有人都会厌恶它，要么我们的神经会被选择成可以毫不费力地饮用。事实上，有史以来唯一一个非常重要的尝试来解释我们感受的*分布*，是格兰特·艾伦在他那本引人注目的小作品《生理美学》中所做的，他的推理完全是基于快乐和痛苦的因果效力，而“双方面”支持者们坚决否认这种因果效力。

    readers may have in appreciating the full utility of having certain nervous possibilities
    emphasised above the rest.  The measure of all utility is, as we have seen, some
    standard posited by Desire.  The standard of survival or self-preservation is
    most potent.  But there exist a host of other standards, aesthetic and moral,
    imperative so long as they do not conflict with this one and sometimes imperative
    over this one.  In the preliminary selection by the senses of certain objective
    orders of movement, it is difficult to see what standard [p. 19] is subserved.  The
    utility of not having a sense for magnetism when we have one for heat, is not
    obvious. We may at most suspect a possible sthetic brightness and clearness to
    result, from the wide intervals. But passing by this obscure region we see without
    the least difficulty why we ignore those ingredients of sensation which are not
    signs of things. What the peculiarity is in itself which makes Smith''s voice
    so different from Brown''s,we need never inquire so long as whenever we hear it
    we say, "There is Smith". For our practical interest in recognising whom we have
    to deal with outweighs our interest in the shades of sound *per se*. The selection
    again of certain attitudes, expressions, &c., in Smith, to stand as characteristic
    of him so that when others are present we say, "He does not look like himself,"
    and if he is sitting to us for his portrait we spend an hour perhaps in placing
    him and lighting him so as to bring out with the utmost clearness these selected
    traits -- this selection, I say, is equally explicable by various sthetic standards,
    permanency simplicity, harmony, clearness, and the like.  Passing now from traits
    to *things,* the utility of selection is obviously created and measured by the
    interests the man has made his own. If Edward never walks out without finding
    a four-leafed clover, while Oliver dies of old age without having seen one, this
    is merely due to the fact that Edward has somehow been led to stake his happiness
    on that particular branch of discovery, and out of a visual field identical with
    that of Oliver has picked the details that minister to this somewhat arbitrary
    interest.  Granted the interest, we cannot deny the use of the picking-out power.  That
    Edward, having this interest in common with many others, should finally succeed
    in emphasising certain of those others and suppressing this, would be an example
    of the utility of selection in the ethical field, supposing always that the new
    interest chosen were of a higher order and not, like making puns, for example,
    as trivial an end as the one forsaken.'

    并且永远不会放弃，他的分类之击就成为他的美德之举。  选择正确名称的能力是所涉及的真正道德能量，所有设定道德目标的人都必须同意，至少这种选择性注意力的至高无用。

    of one of its partial aspects which is the essence of all reasoned thought as
    distinguished from mere habitual association. The utility of reasoned thought
    is too enormous to need demonstration. A reasoning animal can reach its ends by
    paths on which the light of previous experience has never shone.  One who, on
    the contrary, cannot break up the total phenomenon and select its essential character
    must wait till luck has already brought it into conjunction with his End before
    he can guess that any connexion obtains between the two.  All this is elaborated
    in the article "On Brute and Human Intellect" to which I have ventured to refer
    the reader. In that article (p. 274) I stated that I had found it impossible to
    symbolise by any mechanical or chemical peculiarity that tendency of the human
    brain to focalise its activity on small points which seems to constitute the essence
    of its reasoning power.  But if such focalisation be really due not so much to
    structural peculiarity as to the emphasising power of an efficacious consciousness
    superadded, the case need no longer perplex us.

    相反，一个无法分解总现象并选择其基本特征的人必须等到幸运已经将其与他的目标联系在一起，然后才能猜测两者之间是否存在任何联系。 所有这些都在我敢于向读者提及的文章“关于动物和人类智力”的文章中详细阐述。

    of nerve-disturbance.  But he is immediately confronted by the notorious fact
    that the strongest tendencies to automatic activity in the nerves often run most
    counter to the selective pressure of consciousness.  Every day of our lives we
    struggle to escape some tedious tune or odious thought which the momentary disposition
    of the brain keeps forcing upon us.  And, to take more extreme cases, there are
    murderous tendencies to nervous discharge which, so far from involving by their

    the only *rational nexus* is that of identity, and that feeling  and  nerve-tremor
    are disparate.  I feel too that those who smile at the idea of calling consciousness
    an "organ," on a par with other organs, may be moved by a fundamentally right
    instinct. And I moreover feel that that unstable equilibrium of the cerebrum which
    forms the pivot of the argument just finished may, with better knowledge, be found
    perfectly compatible with an average appropriateness of its actions taken in the
    long run.  But with all these concessions made, I still believe the Common-Sense-theory
    to merit our present credence.  Fragmentary probabilities supported by the study
    of details are more worthy of trust than any mere universal conceptions, however
    tempting their simplicity. Science has won all her credit by the former kind of
    reasoning, Metaphysics has lost hers by the latter.  The impossibility of motion,
    of knowledge, either subjective or objective, are proved by arguments as good
    as that which denies causality to feeling, because of its disparity with its effects.  It
    is really monstrous to see the *prestige* of "Science" invoked for a materialistic
    conclusion, reached by methods which, were they only used for spiritualistic ends,
    would be booted at as antiscientific in the extreme.  Our argument, poor as it
    is, has kept at any rate upon the plane of concrete facts. Its circumstantial
    evidence can hardly be upset until the Automaton-theorists shall have condescended
    to make or invoke some new discoveries of detail which shall oblige us to reinterpret
    the facts we already know. But in that case I feel intimately persuaded that the
    reinterpretation will be so wide as to transform the Automaton-theory as thoroughly
    as the popular one.  The Automaton-theory in its present  state contents itself
    with a purely negative deliverance.  There is a chasm, it says, between feeling
    and act.  Consciousness is impotent.  It exists, to be sure, but all those *manners*
    of existence which make it seem relevant to our outward life are mere meaningless
    coincidences, inexplicable parts of the general and intimate irrationality of
    this disjointed world.  What little continuity and reason there seems to be, it

    它存在是有目的的，它有意义的。 但是，对于我们当前的智力来说，所有的意义、相关性和目的都以行动和反应以及因果效应的方式被象征化，常识通过拒绝将其从这些关系中脱离出来来表达对感觉价值的信念。
    当一种哲学出现时，通过新的事实或概念，它可以显示特定的感觉可能没有因果效应，而不是感觉整体成为今天对许多“科学家”（可恶的词！）看来的那种*燃烧*和被驱逐的形象，我们可以把赫胥黎和克利福德教授视为真正的先知。

    grow more and more harmonious with them, and more and more out of tune with the

    reasoning by pointing to what happens in cases of squint.  The squinting eye gives
    double images which are so inconvenient that the mind is forced to abstract its
    attention from them.  This resolute refusal to attend to the sensations of one
    eye soon makes it totally blind. It would seem, indeed, that the attention positively
    suppressed the function of the retina, for the presence of cataract which keeps
    the image from It altogether, results in no such paralysis.  I do not insist on
