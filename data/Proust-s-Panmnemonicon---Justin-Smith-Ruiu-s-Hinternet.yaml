    for non-French readers, is quantity, and therefore the marathon-like endurance
    of anyone who actually reads all seven volumes of *In Search of Lost Time*, and
    can prove it. A 2016 cartoon in the *New Yorker* features a middle-aged couple
    sitting up in bed when one of them realises he and his partner are exactly the
    age at which they must start the opus if they hope to finish it before death.
    In a classic Looney Tunes episode Bugs Bunny has sent Elmer Fudd into a dustcloud
    of St. Vitus-like commotion from which he cannot escape; the sheer temporal extension
    of Fudd’s state is marked by Bugs sitting down next to him and patiently opening
    the cover of *Remembrance of Things Past* (as it used to be called in English).

- en: 'Corollary to the length and weight of Proust’s work is the idea that to take
    it on amounts to a form of world-renunciation, and potentially an abnegation of
    our “real” moral connections and political duties. I recall shortly after September
    11, 2001, Christopher Hitchens wrote that he had recently been on the cusp of
    giving up on politics altogether and devoting himself to a sustained critical
    work on the French novelist, only to be awoken and drawn back into the world by
    “Islamofascism”, and to the calling of militant atheism that would occupy him
    for the rest of his life. I don’t believe Hitchens was telling the truth about
    this —I don’t believe he had an extended analysis of Proust inside him and ready
    to go, if only real-world events hadn’t gotten in the way—, but in any case it
    casts Proust again into a peculiar role, one that is not so different from the
    self-help use-value that authors like Alain de Botton in his consistently banal
    *How Proust Can Change Your Life* (1997) promise he will deliver: Proust as a
    private indulgence and a retreat from engagement.'

  zh: 普鲁斯特作品的长度和厚重性的相关性表明，阅读它等同于一种对世界的摒弃，可能是对我们“真实”的道德联系和政治责任的放弃。我记得2001年9月11日之后不久，克里斯托弗·希钦斯写道，他最近曾在几乎放弃政治并专注于对这位法国小说家进行持续批判性工作的边缘，直到被“伊斯兰法西斯主义”唤醒并重新回到世界，以及被持久的无神论召唤，这将占据他余生。我不认为希钦斯在这方面说了实话——我不认为他内心深处已经有了对普鲁斯特的深入分析，并随时准备着，只是真实世界的事件阻止了他——但无论如何，这再次将普鲁斯特推向了一种特殊的角色，与阿兰·德·波顿在他那一贯平庸的《普鲁斯特如何改变你的生活》（1997年）中所承诺的自助使用价值并没有太大差别：普鲁斯特作为一种私人享受和一种逃避。
- en: Very much unlike Hitchens, the multiple crises of the contemporary world have
    led me to find nothing so worthy of my attention as Proust. There are many reasons
    for this, some entirely personal, others defensible within a shared space of reason.
    In part it is that it’s in my nature to take on formidable things; I’ve always
    liked big books *because* they’re big. In part I feel a growing sense of rhyme
    between my own life and Proust’s; not that I’ve accomplished anything like what
    he was able to do in his fifty-one years, but only that I, too, have entered what
    I experience as my mostly supine, mostly bedridden phase of incurable graphomania,
    in which my “life” —the social events and the drinking and the traveling and the
    pursuit of day-to-day matters, as Czesɫaw Miɫosz put it, “under orders from the
    erotic imagination”— appears to me to be definitively over, even if I’ve set my
    noblesse-oblige on autopilot and still occasionally go through the motions learned
    in the old times. Proust’s writing bed, now lovingly relocated to the Carnavalet
    Museum for the history of Paris, touches me even more than the wisp of Marie Antoinette’s
    golden hair in a locket on display down the hall, as an emblem of my own condition.

    —— 社交活动、饮酒、旅行和日常琐事的追逐，如塞斯瓦夫·米沃什所说，“听从情欲想象的指令” —— 在我看来已经完结，即使我已将我的责任心设置为自动驾驶，仍然偶尔按照旧时的模式行事。普鲁斯的写作床，现在已经被爱心地搬迁到卡尔纳瓦莱博物馆，比沿走廊展示的玛丽·安托瓦内特金色头发的饰物更触动我，它成为我自身状态的象征。

    for accessing and probing memory in the way that Proust discovered how to do.
    I find that quite unconsciously much of what I’ve written here at The Hinternet
    has been both an exploration of my own memories from the old days, and an extended
    reflection on what memories are, and what the faculty of memory is, in relation
    to the present. In both [straightforward essay form](https://justinehsmith.substack.com/p/the-panmnemonicon)
    and in [attempts at science-fiction](https://justinehsmith.substack.com/p/ctr-technology),
    I have pursued the idea of the “panmnemonicon”. This is a variation on Jeremy
    Bentham’s fantasy of the panopticon: a technology that enables us, or forces us,
    not only to see everything present, but to recall, or to have available for recall,
    everything past as well. I have suggested that search-engine technology is bringing
    this fantasy ever closer to such a reality. It seems to me also that we may look
    at such monumental results as Prousts’s of the tekhnē of prose-writing as it had
    developed by the early twentieth century to be themselves contributions to the
    development of panmnemonic technology, of a new human reality in which time cannot

    reading novels in languages you don’t fully know yet, incidentally; it’s a different
    kind of aesthetic experience, but one worth having, and in the case of some novels,

    of the work itself.) I decided this summer to read all seven volumes in order,
    from start to finish, and to reflect on them, occasionally, here at The Hinternet.
    I’ve just now finished volume one, *Du côté de chez Swann*, and so am offering

    called the “mechanics” of life at Versailles under Louis XIV. We settle into our
    little traintrains perhaps not because we’ve ceased to value what is in fact the

    such as Shaftesbury with his mossy gardens, and German Romantics up to and including

    operating indifferently to the niceties of polite society. I don’t know what McCarthy’s
    opinion of Proust is, but it seems likely that the American author would place
    him in that category of writers whose work “doesn’t concern life and death,” and
    therefore “[is] not interesting.” In a certain sense it’s hard to imagine a novel
    that doesn’t concern at least “life” (Edwin Abbott’s *Flatland* of 1884, perhaps,
    whose protagonists are geometrical forms? But even these are somehow animate.)
    All of Proust’s characters are definitely alive, and if their death does not loom
    in the form of a lightning-strike or a scalping, nonetheless all the chatter of
    le monde, all the intricate dissection of all the nobles and their “presentation
    of self in everyday life”, of who is and is no longer fréquentable, of Swann’s
    “bad marriage” — all of this plainly bears some important relationship to death
    too: namely, the neverending effort of human beings to shut it out, a by-product
    of which is culture.'

    — 所有这一切显然都与死亡有重要的关系：即人类不断努力排除它的永恒努力的副产品，这种文化。

    has confounded many readers. It is neither elegiac nor satirical, and you can
    never quite figure out whether he loves the world he is describing or holds it
    in contempt. Readers trained up on the “withering” satire of a Balzac or the critical
    gaze of the nineteenth-century social novelists wait in vain for an expression
    of outright disapproval. But they also wait in vain for anything boldly reactionary,
    any affirmation of the natural justice on which the unequal aristocratic order
    is based. Ideologues have, as we’ll see, taken this ambiguity as itself reactionary;
    I take it as Proust’s heeding the highest call of literature, as distinct from
    pamphleteering.

    the few centuries in which we took dreams to be the “unreal” part of our daily
    cycle, and wakefulness to be the “real” part, may in the end turn out to be a
    historical aberration. Certainly, if we survey the different cultures of the world,
    it is a deviant thing to suppose that dreams are mere hallucinations, while, say,
    laboring in a factory is “the real stuff”. One of the most important services
    of modern literature, on this view, has been to preserve a role for the dream-life
    in a culture that in its philosophy and its etiquette (which may amount to the
    same thing) does everything it can to sweep dreaming under the rug.

    me in this connection the importance of the early passage of volume one in which
    the narrator, having fallen asleep while reading, comes to sense “that I was myself
    the thing of which the work spoke: a church, a quartet, the rivalry between François

- en: How on earth can a person bea rivalry? Long ago I experienced a memorable hypnagogic
    moment in which I was Manhattan, while the person with whom I shared a bed was
    Brooklyn. That’s strange enough, but at least there we were two good-sized physical
    masses, just as we ordinarily take ourselves to be in waking life. But a rivalry
    is a relation that obtains between two such masses, a consequence of their subjectivities
    in collision, and not a being itself. Yet think now of seeing a young couple in
    love, walking hand-in-hand. They awaken a bittersweet desire in you, but for what
    exactly? To be one of them? Which one? Both? Or perhaps the desire is not to be
    either one of them at all, but to be the relation between them, to be the union
    of their surfaces or the contact of their souls. In fact subjective experience,
    perhaps especially experience fueled by desire, seems very often to insinuate
    itself between people in this way, and make its home there. Proust then lays bare
    here something we ordinarily don’t notice about subjective consciousness as such,
    and does so by taking dreaming as the most exemplary state of it, rather than
    an embarassing aberration, a nightly lapse into florid psychosis.

    但是竞争是在两个这样的物体之间存在的关系，是它们的主体性碰撞的结果，并不是一种实体本身。 现在想象一下看到一对年轻恋人手牵手散步。 他们唤起了你一种苦乐交加的欲望，但确切地是什么？
    成为他们中的一个？ 哪一个？ 或者两个都是？ 或者也许欲望根本不是成为他们中的任何一个，而是成为他们之间的关系，成为他们表面的联合或灵魂的接触。 实际上，主观体验，也许特别是由欲望驱动的体验，似乎经常以这种方式介入人与人之间，并在那里安家。
    然后，普鲁斯特在这里揭示了我们通常不会注意到的关于主观意识本身的一些事物，通过将梦境视为最典型的状态，而不是尴尬的偏差，夜间陷入花哨的精神病。

  zh: 文学的大部分历史并非如此。在传统口头文学中，确实召唤起了某种过去，但它与我们所谓的过去不同，首先它是一个集体的过去，其次是在一个“神话”领域中发挥作用，那里的现实法则不同，人们通常被构想为祖先、英雄或神灵。
- en: 'Curiously, Proust’s narrator describes his poor, beleaguered servant Françoise
    as hosting a repository of ancestral knowledge that is more akin to the communal
    and mythical treasury of the past communicated in “archaic” literature, than to
    the singular tabulation of events that Grandma Bertie thought to provide when
    prompted to speak of the past. Thus:'

  zh: 奇怪的是，普鲁斯特的叙述者将他那贫穷而备受煎熬的仆人弗朗索瓦描述为一个承载着祖先知识的库存，更像是“古老”文学中传达的过去的共同和神话宝库，而不是贝蒂奶奶被促请讲述过去时提供的事件的独特清单。因此：
- en: How French that church was! Above the door, the saints, the king-knights with
    a fleur-de-lys in their hands, the scenes of weddings and funerals, were represented
    as they might have been in the soul of Françoise. The sculptor had also related
    certain anecdotes pertaining to Aristotle and to Virgil, in the same way that
    Françoise might have freely spoken in the kitchen of Saint Louis as someone she
    had personally known… One sensed that the notions that the medieval artist and
    the medieval peasant-woman (surviving into the nineteenth century) had of ancient
    and Christian history, which were marked as much by imprecision as by familiarity,
    were drawn not from books, but from a tradition that was ancient and direct at
    once, uninterrupted, oral, deformed, unrecognisable and alive.

  zh: 那座教堂多么法国化！门上，圣徒们，手持百合花王家骑士，婚礼和葬礼的场景，都被描绘出来，仿佛是弗朗索瓦心灵深处的样子。雕刻家还讲述了与亚里士多德和维吉尔相关的某些轶事，就像弗朗索瓦在圣路易厨房里自由交谈时可能会说的……人们感觉到，中世纪艺术家和中世纪农妇（一直延续到十九世纪）对古代和基督教历史的概念，既不精确又熟悉，不是来自书籍，而是来自一个古老而直接的传统，一种不间断的口头传统，扭曲、难以辨认却又生动。
- en: How French that church was, just like the soul of Françoise. The idea that a
    person can be a living embodiment, a traduction of archaic national history, and
    that this history is not betrayed but on the contrary kept alive by its quality
    of imprecision, is at the same time a bulwark against the sense that the past
    is something that recedes inescapably and regrettably from us as it transforms
    into bittersweet memory. This is an idea that Proust’s own work is in the course
    of shattering, even as he was memorialising it through the character of Françoise.

  zh: 那座教堂多么法国化，就像弗朗索瓦的心灵一样。一个人可以成为活生生的体现，是古老国家历史的翻译，这个历史并没有被背叛，相反，通过其不精确性而保持着生命力，这同时也是对过去是不可逃避和遗憾地远离我们，而变成苦涩记忆的感觉的一种壁垒。这是普鲁斯特自己作品正在摧毁的一个理念，即使他通过弗朗索瓦的角色来纪念它。
- en: 'As for Bertie, I don’t know whether her memories were, for her, bittersweet
    or rather a source of joy. Like Proust, she’s poker-faced as to her general affective
    disposition to the parade of characters she brings back from memory. But like
    Proust, too, she takes for granted that this is what the past is: a parade of
    characters we may seek to retrieve, if only ever partially.'

  zh: 至于伯蒂，我不知道她的回忆对她来说是苦涩的还是一种快乐的源泉。像普鲁斯特一样，她对她从记忆中带回的角色的一般情感倾向是一副无动于衷的表情。但像普鲁斯特一样，她也认为这就是过去的真实面貌：一个我们可能试图检索的角色队列，即使只是部分地。
- en: What Proust put in place of the old “mythical” past embodied by Françoise was
    a draft of what I have called “the panmnemonicon”, where, ideally, all of it,
    everything it was ever like to have lived a singular human life, is available
    for recall. To some extent such an ideal has always been available through the
    figure of divine omniscience. A medieval nun bathing with a wooden plank over
    the surface of the tub so that God would not see her? That’s an idea ancestral
    to the panopticon, or the fear of it. The list of all your sins that St. Peter
    has waiting for you on your arrival at the Gates of Heaven? That is an anticipation
    of the panmnemonicon.

  zh: 普鲁斯特用来代替由弗朗索瓦体现的旧的“神话”过去的是我称之为“全记忆宫”的草案，在那里，理想情况下，所有的一切，所有曾经经历过的独特人生，都可以被召唤回忆。在某种程度上，这样的理想一直通过神圣全知的形象可得到。中世纪的修女在浴缸上方放置木板，以免上帝看见？这是先祖对全记忆宫的预期，或者对其恐惧。圣彼得在天堂之门口等待你时准备好的你所有罪孽的清单？这是对全记忆宫的一种预期。
- en: Proust’s narrator, of course, takes the sin out of the project, sees none of
    it for example in the birthing of a woman from his thigh (Aunt Léonie, by contrast,
    is too weighted with the legacy of sin to even acknowledge in language that she
    ever sleeps, as sleep implies dreaming and dreaming implies sensual fantasy).
    Yet the project of literary total recall may be seen as something like an attempt
    to beat God to the chase, and come up with the list on one’s own before dying.
    Of course unlike God’s list our list will always remain incomplete; we are finite
    beings after all. But this is perhaps where the distance of literary autofiction,
    as opposed to the straight autobiographical enumeration of singular events, also
    helps through style, through beauty, to convey the appearance of completeness.

  zh: 当然，普鲁斯特的叙述者去掉了这个项目中的罪孽，比如从他的大腿中生出一个女人（相比之下，莱奥妮阿姨太过负重，甚至不承认她曾经睡过，因为睡眠意味着做梦，做梦意味着感官幻想）。然而，文学全记忆的项目可能被看作是在死之前试图在上帝之前列出自己的清单，而不像上帝的清单那样永远不完整；毕竟我们是有限的存在。但这也许是文学自传距离的地方，与直接的自传式事件列举不同，它也通过风格、通过美来传达完整性的外观。
- en: 'I recall a fantastic story some years ago in the *New Yorker*, I don’t remember
    who wrote it, in which a man gets shot in the head during a bank robbery. The
    bulk of the narrative takes place within the few milliseconds of the bullet’s
    voyage through his brain tissue. Or rather, the bulk of it is a sort of parenthetical
    listing of all the moments from the man’s life that did *not* flash before his
    eyes during these milliseconds: nothing about his parents, nothing about his career,
    nothing about the lover who used to refer to sex as “playing hide-the-mole”. Instead
    he remembered a boy from Georgia who had been on his baseball team as a kid, and
    who used to say “they is” instead of “they are”. So in the very final nanosecond
    of the man’s life, this is what he thinks: *They is, they is*.'

  zh: 几年前，《纽约客》上发表了一个奇妙的故事，我不记得是谁写的了，在那个故事里，一个男人在一场银行抢劫中被击中头部。故事的大部分发生在子弹穿过他的脑组织的几毫秒内。或者更确切地说，大部分内容是对在这几毫秒内没有闪现在他眼前的所有生活时刻的一种括号式列举：没有关于他父母的事，没有关于他的职业生涯的事，也没有关于把性称为“玩藏獒”的情人的事。相反，他记得一个来自乔治亚州的男孩，小时候和他在棒球队一起，他习惯用“they
    is”代替“they are”。所以在男人生命的最后纳秒，他的想法是：*They is, they is*。

    technologies may improve to the point where I can bring him back from the void
    of the past by entering nothing more than this faint trace of him into the universal
