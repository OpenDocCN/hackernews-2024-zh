- en: Right now, EVs are known for having greater up-front costs than comparable gas-powered
    cars. Making the case for EVs involves comparing their cost over the length of
    ownership, which yields significant savings due to lower refueling (or recharging)
    and lower maintenance bills. But lower production costs would invert that formula,
    making EVs cheaper to buy up-front but more expensive in the long run. At least,
    when taking into account EV insurance and repair costs.

  zh: 目前，电动汽车的起始成本通常高于同类汽油车。支持电动汽车的理由在于比较其在使用寿命期间的成本，由于加油（或充电）费用较低以及维护费用减少，可以实现显著的节省。但如果生产成本降低，情况可能会反转，使得电动汽车在购买时更便宜，但长期来看更昂贵。尤其是考虑到电动汽车的保险和维修成本时。

    Model 3s only to make an about-face and sell off its rental EVs. Hertz expected
    to save money on fuel and maintenance, but failed to factor in the higher cost
    of insurance premiums and the possibility of its new EVs being written off due

    Or, it doesn’t seem old enough to be sent to scrap because its charging plug would
    cost more to fix than the whole car is worth. It looks like price parity with
    gas cars continues to elude EVs, at least until they can boast both lower production
