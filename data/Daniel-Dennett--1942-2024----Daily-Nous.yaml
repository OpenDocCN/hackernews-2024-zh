- en: Philosophy has just lost one of its most powerful voices and heroes. Daniel
    Dennett was a member of the critically endangered species of polymath, a talent
    that is becoming less and less common while social media, artificial intelligence,
    religious dogma, and restrictive government policies creep in to make us, humans,
    more and more thoughtless, lucrative, and tax-worthy.

  zh: 哲学刚刚失去了其中一个最有影响力和英雄般的声音。丹尼尔·丹尼特是一种日益稀有的多才多艺的人才的成员，而社交媒体、人工智能、宗教教条和限制性政府政策的侵入则使我们人类变得越来越无思想、令人利润和可税收。
- en: 'He was a genius of rare abilities to the extreme, a philosopher who neuroscientists
    considered one of their own. A person of this sort is born, perhaps, once every
    few centuries, and we didn’t appreciate how lucky we were to have lived alongside
    him. Now, Daniel C. Dennett is joining the long line of philosophy’s greatest
    thinkers who are forever etched in our thoughts and memories. If the theists are
    right, and God exists, then it won’t bode well for the theists who insultingly
    write on his X (Twitter) profile that he’s now at God’s mercy. Rather, it’s the
    other way around: that deity will have to watch out if he knows what’s good for
    him. Heaven is under new management, and God just got a demotion for two thousand
    years of such incompetently sloppy work. I imagine him rolling up his sleeve,
    as he storms into God’s office, saying “Move aside, oaf! It’s going to literally
    take a genius to unravel the mess you made since time immemorial!”'

  zh: 他是一个极度罕见的天才，是一个被神经科学家认为是他们中的一员的哲学家。也许，这样的人每隔几个世纪才出现一次，而我们并没有意识到自己有幸与他共生活在一起。如今，丹尼尔·C·丹尼特正加入哲学史上最伟大思想家的长队，他们永远铭刻在我们的思想和记忆中。如果有神存在，那么对于亵渎地在他的X（Twitter）资料上写道他现在任由神的处置的有神论者而言，这不是个好兆头。相反，事情恰恰相反：那位神祇如果知道自己的利益，将不得不小心应付。天堂已经换了新管理，上帝因为两千年来的那些粗心大意的工作而被降职了。我想象他卷起袖子，怒气冲冲地闯入上帝的办公室，说：“让开，蠢货！要解开你自古以来搞得一团糟的乱子，可得需要一个天才！”
- en: As a titan who towers among the giants of philosophy, of old and new, and whose
    legendary eccentricity, exceptional brilliance, and peerlessly witty humour were
    too much for one discipline to handle, a great void, vast like a supermassive
    black hole at the epicenter of a galaxy with an insatiable hunger to devour all
    in its path, has emerged abruptly. I know that, if he were here, he’d tell us
    to get our acts together and continue what he started. There is so much to be
    done in philosophy, and Dennett gave it his all, fighting the dogma, intolerance,
    and cruelties of religions, and the myriad forms of ignorance taking up the anodyne
    appearances of “theories” in various disciplines. Don’t let instrumentalism die.

  zh: 作为在哲学界傲视群雄的巨人，无论是古代还是现代，丹尼特的传奇古怪、卓越才智和无与伦比的幽默都让一门学科难以招架。一个巨大的空白突然出现，就像一个超大质量黑洞的中心在银河系中心涌现出来，具有不可满足的饥渴，要吞噬一切。我知道，如果他在这里，他会告诉我们鼓起勇气继续他开始的事业。哲学中有很多工作要做，而丹尼特已经尽其所能，与宗教的教条、偏见和残酷斗争，以及各种形式的无知，以其各种外观伪装成“理论”。不要让实用主义消亡。
- en: The best way to honour our fallen champion is by rallying by his memory and
    legacies and finishing what he started. If there is a theism-versus-atheism debate,
    bring up his name. If there is some mumbo-jumbo about free will or consciousness,
    bring up his name; dilute the idea of unconstrained free will; reduce consciousness
    to a series of memes! Cite his name in your articles and books, and keep citing
    him. Let’s build on his theories and make instrumentalism a dominant perspective,
    not only in philosophy but in society at large. No matter what anyone says, Dennett
    didn’t “die”; he merely took on another form as our collective thoughts. He is
    now bigger than ever; theists will never be able to shake him off. And the best
    way to keep him alive is by building on his legacy.

  zh: 通过我们对他的记忆和遗产的集会，并完成他所开始的事业，是最好的纪念我们逝去的冠军的方式。如果存在有神论与无神论的辩论，请提到他的名字。如果有关自由意志或意识的一些胡言乱语，请提到他的名字；淡化无拘无束的自由意志的概念；将意识减少为一系列的模因！在你的文章和书籍中引用他的名字，并继续引用他。让我们建立在他的理论基础上，并使工具主义成为主导观点，不仅在哲学上而且在整个社会中。无论别人怎么说，丹尼特并没有“死去”；他只是以我们的集体思想形式继续存在。他现在比以往任何时候都更加伟大；信奉神的人永远无法摆脱他。保持他活着的最佳方式是建立在他的遗产上。
