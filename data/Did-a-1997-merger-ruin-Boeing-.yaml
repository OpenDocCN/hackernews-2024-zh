- en: Well, it probably all began in the [summer of 1997](https://qz.com/1776080/how-the-mcdonnell-douglas-boeing-merger-led-to-the-737-max-crisis?utm_source=email&utm_medium=Quartz_Daily_Brief_Asia&utm_content=1851147566).

- en: Boeing wanted to establish dominance and show the world who was boss in the
    airline industry. So it decided to acquire another plane manufacturer called McDonnell
    Douglas. It was a massive merger worth $14 billion.
  id: totrans-19

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 波音想要建立统治地位，向世界展示谁才是航空工业的老大。因此，它决定收购另一家飞机制造商麦道公司。这是一次价值 140 亿美元的大规模合并。
- en: Now after the merger, the new entity retained the Boeing name. It was expected
    since it was Boeing that splashed the cash. But the problem was that the culture
    of McDonnell Douglas seeped in. And that changed the face of Boeing completely.

  zh: 现在合并之后，新实体保留了波音的名称。这是意料之中的，因为是波音在出资。但问题是麦道公司的文化渗透了进来。这完全改变了波音的面貌。
- en: See, the Boeing of the pre-merger era was called an ‘engineers’ company’. The
    ones who made these flying machines called the shots. Costs didn’t matter and
    it was only quality and design that did. They wanted to ensure that only their
    best ideas took to the skies. Safety was paramount. And the [Chief Financial Officer](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/11/how-boeing-lost-its-bearings/602188/%5C)
    who was answerable to Wall Street about costs didn’t care much about trying to
    impress the bankers either.

  zh: 你看，合并前的波音被称为‘工程师公司’。制造这些飞行器的人说了算。成本不重要，唯有质量和设计才是关键。他们希望只有他们最好的想法才能飞上蓝天。安全至关重要。而对于要向华尔街负责成本的首席财务官也不怎么在意试图给银行家留下深刻印象。
- en: But after the merger, everything changed.

  zh: 但合并之后，一切都改变了。
- en: The CEO of McDonnell Douglas actually became the CEO of Boeing. A chairman with
    no aviation background, but who’d worked in General Electric, was also appointed.
    The company started paying attention to creating shareholder value which was hardly
    a priority earlier. And as one article put it, “Now, a passion for great planes
    was replaced with a passion for affordability.” Boeing even turned to [outsourcing](https://hbr.org/2014/06/the-price-of-wall-streets-power)
    critical operations. Sure, it made the balance sheet ‘asset light’, but, it came
    at the cost of quality.

  zh: 麦道公司的首席执行官实际上成了波音公司的首席执行官。一位没有航空背景但在通用电气公司工作过的主席也被任命。公司开始重视创造股东价值，这在以前根本不是首要任务。正如一篇文章中所说，“现在，对于出色飞机的热情被对成本的热情所取代。”波音甚至开始[外包](https://hbr.org/2014/06/the-price-of-wall-streets-power)关键业务。当然，这使资产负债表“轻资产”，但代价是牺牲了质量。
- en: To top it all off, they even moved management headquarters away from where all
    the engineering took place — from Seattle to Chicago.

  zh: 更甚的是，他们甚至将管理总部从工程部门所在的西雅图迁往芝加哥。
- en: At first, no one said anything. Sure, there was a joke that went, “McDonnell
    Douglas bought Boeing with Boeing’s money.” But it was a harmless observation.
    The planes kept rolling off the conveyor belt.
  id: totrans-25
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 起初，没有人说任何话。当然，有一个笑话是这样的，“麦道公司用波音的钱收购了波音。”但这只是一个无害的观察。飞机仍然源源不断地从传送带上滚出来。

  id: totrans-26
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 但是，2018年发生了变化。波音企业文化的崩溃浮出水面。
- en: See, [American Airlines](https://finshots.in/archive/boeing-gone/) was looking
    to place an order with Boeing’s rival Airbus. Airbus had created the A320neo which
    was more fuel-efficient. And while initially, Boeing scoffed at Airbus, the call
    from American Airlines was a jolt out of the blue. That’s when Boeing realised
    it had fallen behind.
  id: totrans-27

  zh: 看，[美国航空公司](https://finshots.in/archive/boeing-gone/)原本准备向波音的竞争对手空客订购。空客已经推出了A320neo，更省燃油。而最初，波音对空客不屑一顾，但美国航空公司的电话却让波音大吃一惊。这时，波音意识到自己已经落后了。
- en: But it didn’t have time on its hands to innovate and build something from scratch.
    And that’s when the McDonnell Douglas way of doing things caught on — instead
    of spending $20 billion on a new plane, Boeing budgeted a [puny $2.5 billion](https://ethicsunwrapped.utexas.edu/engineering-ethics-and-the-boeing-scandal)
    and decided to tweak its iconic 737\. Technical drawings for the model were being
    churned out at double the pace, workers from other departments were pulled in
    for the Max project, and timely delivery took precedence over quality. The idea
    was to make small but significant changes to 737 while sticking to the original
    design so that pilots wouldn’t really have to be retrained either.
  id: totrans-28
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 但是，他们不得不抓紧时间创新，不能从零开始打造飞机。这时候，麦道公司的做法开始流行起来——波音不再花费200亿美元买一架新飞机，而是预算了[puny $2.5
    billion](https://ethicsunwrapped.utexas.edu/engineering-ethics-and-the-boeing-scandal)，决定对其标志性的737进行调整。该机型的技术图纸以双倍速率被制作，其他部门的工人被拉进了Max项目，及时交付开始优先于质量。其想法是对737进行一些小但重大的改动，同时保持原始设计，这样飞行员实际上不需要接受重新培训。
- en: But, flying a machine in the sky isn’t child’s play. Apparently, from 2010 to
    2014, Boeing’s CEO never mentioned safety even once in their annual statement.
    And we all know what happens when ethics and quality fly out of the window!

  zh: 但是，让机器在天空中飞行并不是儿戏。显然，从2010年到2014年，波音的首席执行官在年度报告中甚至没有一次提到安全。我们都知道，当道德和质量被抛到九霄云外时会发生什么！
- en: And in 2018, when two 737 Max planes crashed and killed hundreds of people,
    everyone knew that it was the billion-dollar merger with McDonnell Douglas that
    ultimately became Boeing’s downfall.

    best-selling plane in Boeing’s history. And 76% of the company’s outstanding order
