    if you found such a civilization?” he asked, assuming both interlocutors would
    have the patience to wait for the signals to be transmitted back and forth. I
    suggested that we might try beep, beep-beep, beep-beep-beep, for 1, 2, 3, and
    so forth, and then perhaps 1, 2, 3 . . ., 92 for the stable (except 41 and 63)
    chemical elements, etc., etc. “Wait,” said the *sous-directeur*, “that is absurd.

    circles in France (and elsewhere). That is the idea that the structures and objects
    of mathematics—say, Lie groups—have a reality, that they exist, in a sense, somewhere
    beyond space and time. (It is easy to see how one can come to think that way.
    Start with the positive integers—they certainly exist, in the sense of being used
    to count things. Number theory—okay. Zero and negative numbers—why not? Fractions,
    square roots? Solutions of algebraic equations in complex numbers? Probably—one
    is on a slippery slope.) These two points of view are argued in a book, *Mati*è*re*
    à *Pens*é*e*, published recently by the biologist Jean-Pierre Changeux and the
    mathematician Alain Connes. I shall not inflict all their philosophical arguments
    on this congenial group, and anyway I have never studied them carefully. Let me

- en: Yang–Mills theory, from the physics point of view, was a generalization of quantum
    electrodynamics from the gauge group U1 to the gauge group SU2 with noncommuting
    charges. Later, we generalized it to all products of U1 factors and simple compact
    Lie groups, including SU3\. Today the “standard model” of elementary particle
    physics, apart from gravitation, is based on SU3 x SU2 x U1\. Moreover, Einsteinian
    gravitation has strong parallels with generalized Yang–Mills theory, although
    the gravitation theory is based on the noncompact Lorentz group and involves a
    tensor instead of a vector field. What does it mean that this progression from
    one gauge group to another has worked so well? Are we really dealing with something
    peculiar to the human mind or with a phenomenon so deeply rooted in the properties
    of nature that any advanced complex adaptive system would be likely to follow

    x SU2 x U1。此外，爱因斯坦引力理论与广义杨-米尔斯理论有很强的类比性，尽管引力理论基于非紧致的洛伦兹群，并涉及张量而非矢量场。这种从一个规范群到另一个规范群的进展如此成功，这意味着什么？我们真的在处理人类思维中的某些特有现象，还是处理与自然属性深深根植相关的现象，使得任何先进的复杂自适应系统都可能遵循类似的路径？

    more about the law of gravitation, and a lot about the laws of motion. Moreover,
    he carried out the experiment showing that white light is made up of the colors

    some of which may apply at the next layer—in fact, even the old mathematics may
    still be useful at the next layer. These generalizations may be performed either

    the conformal string symmetries that encompass the bootstrap principle and general
    relativity, and an internal symmetry group E8 x E8 that undergoes spontaneous
    symmetry breaking. The outer layers of the onion show gravitation and electromagnetism.
    Penetrating a little further turns up SU2 x Ul, SU3 of color, and the bootstrap
    idea. And so it goes on. The mathematics at each level is not usually identical

  zh: 在早期科学的谦逊层面上，这种自相似性非常明显。电力、引力和磁力都具有相同的l/r²力，正如我们所见，牛顿暗示可能还存在一些短程力。也许在某些遗失的手稿中，他提出了矢量势！现在，科学家和数学家正在关注缩放现象，我们在复杂系统的研究中看到了超出许多数量级的惊人的幂律。通常在保持幂律的同时，底层机制正在变化，如宇宙射线能谱、技术随时间的进步等等。
- en: The renormalization group, which we invented for renormalizable quantum field
    theory, turns out to apply not only to critical phenomena in condensed matter
    but to numerous other far-flung subjects as well. The biological and social sciences
    are just as much involved in these discoveries of scaling behavior as the physical
    sciences. We are always dealing with Nature consonant and conformable to herself,
    not only within scaling behavior but also in the occurrence of similar phenomenological
    laws in a plethora of disparate areas. So the approximate self-similarity of the
    laws of nature runs the gamut from the simple underlying laws of fundamental physics
    to the phenomenological laws of the most complex phenomena. No wonder our mathematics
    keeps working so well in the sciences, when self-similarity is so widespread.

  zh: 为了可重正量子场论而发明的重整化群不仅适用于凝聚态物质中的临界现象，而且适用于许多其他遥远的主题。生物和社会科学在这些尺度行为的发现中同样参与。我们始终处理着自然与自身一致和符合的问题，不仅在尺度行为中如此，而且在许多不同领域中的类似现象学定律的发生中也是如此。因此，从基本物理的简单基础定律到最复杂现象的现象学定律的近似自相似性在自然法则中广泛存在。难怪我们的数学在科学中如此有效，当自相似性如此普遍时。
- en: Of course, there may be something important here about the nature of mathematics
    itself. In connection with that, let me close by paraphrasing some wonderful remarks
    made by that brilliant and modest theoretical physicist Feza Gürsey on the occasion
    of his receiving, at the University of Miami, not the valuable kind of prize he
    deserves but half of the $1,000 Oppenheimer Prize. He said, more or less, that
    he had achieved some success by pointing, often before other theorists, to mathematical
    structures that would be useful in the near future in elementary particle physics.
    But often he hadn’t had any clear idea of exactly how or why these mathematical
    methods would be used. He compared himself with Inspector Clouseau, bumbling along,
    bumping into walls, but somehow finally pointing to the right suspects. Why, he
    asked, did the Inspector Clouseau method work? Maybe, he suggested, because such
    mathematical structures are comparatively rare, so that it is possible to find
    and identify something like the exceptional group E8 as an object of interest
    simply because structures with its remarkable properties are not thick on the
    ground. Thus, it may be that the character of mathematics plays a role in our
    story, along with Nature consonant and conformable to herself.

  zh: 当然，这里可能存在关于数学本质的重要内容。在这方面，让我闭幕时引用一些由那位聪明而谦逊的理论物理学家费扎·古尔塞在迈阿密大学领取奥本海默奖1000美元的一半时所作的精彩言论。虽然他没有得到应得的宝贵奖项，但他说，他指出了一些在将来基本粒子物理学中将会有用的数学结构，通常比其他理论家更早。但是他经常没有清楚地知道这些数学方法究竟如何或为什么会被使用。他将自己比作克鲁索探长，笨拙地行走，撞到墙壁，但最终总能指出正确的嫌疑犯。他问，克鲁索探长的方法为什么有效？也许，他建议，因为这样的数学结构相对罕见，所以可以找到并识别出像杰出群体E8这样的对象，仅仅因为具有其显著特性的结构并不常见。因此，数学的特性可能在我们的故事中起到作用，与自然的和谐一致。
