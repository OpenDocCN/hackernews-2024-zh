    John Barnett was in Charleston, giving a deposition for the whistleblower suit
    he had filed against Boeing. According to one of his lawyers, Rob Turkewitz, he
    was upbeat about his testimony, feeling he was finally able to tell the story
    of his efforts to get the company to take safety more seriously—and the rejection
    of those efforts by his bosses, who, according to Barnett, simply didn’t want
