    This piece focuses on certain elements that we think will stifle innovation and
    substantially hinder the efforts of private companies to enhance, or even maintain,
    core security and privacy products, features, and architecture, especially with
    respect to the use of encryption. To be sure, governments in democratic countries
    face challenges in accessing the content of communications of spies, terrorists,
    and other threat actors. They need help. But these purported solutions in the
    bill aren’t the right way to do it.

    Act](https://www.gchq.gov.uk/information/investigatory-powers-act) would give
    the U.K. government, at the sole discretion of the secretary of state for the
    Home Department (Home Office), the power to require a company to tell the U.K.
    government about new or changed products or features before the company could
    launch them. This mandate could be issued without consultation with privacy regulators
    or others in a position to opine on proportionality or other considerations, much

  zh: 建议修正[2016年侦查权法](https://www.gchq.gov.uk/information/investigatory-powers-act)的修正案，将授予英国政府在内政部国务大臣（内政部）的唯一酌情权下，要求公司在其推出新产品或功能之前告知英国政府的权力。此命令可在未经隐私监管机构或其他有权就比例或其他考虑事项发表意见，更不用说司法审查的情况下发布。
- en: Following receipt of a “Notification Notice” (yes, that’s actually what it is
    [called](https://www.parallelparliament.co.uk/debate/2023-12-11/lords/lords-chamber/investigatory-powers-amendment-bill-hl)),
    the U.K. government could use existing powers to require that the company meet
    surveillance capability demands as a condition of making a product or feature
    available. Demands are left to the discretion of the government and could include,
    for example, disabling security like encryption, user access controls, and privacy
    protection features. If the government’s demands are not met, the company may
    have no choice but to abandon the product or feature launch, giving the government
    essentially a veto power on how companies innovate and improve their products.
    (The government could even block a company from deprecating a service or deleting
    data.) All of this is done secretly, with the company prohibited from disclosing
    it unless the government allows it to do so. The act purports to extend enforceability
    to non-U.K. companies, and the amendments expand that to retention and these notices,
    exacerbating the challenges that companies face. Paired with the gag order that
    comes with each, this has several effects, including that the non-U.K. company
    can’t notify its home government of the demand, even one that violates the law
    of the home government, preventing any sort of diplomatic assistance.

  zh: 英国政府在收到“通知通知”（是的，实际上就是这么称呼的[连接](https://www.parallelparliament.co.uk/debate/2023-12-11/lords/lords-chamber/investigatory-powers-amendment-bill-hl)）之后，可以利用现有权力要求公司在产品或功能发布时满足监视能力的要求。这些要求由政府酌情决定，可能包括禁用加密、用户访问控制和隐私保护功能等安全措施。如果公司未能满足政府的要求，公司可能别无选择，只能放弃产品或功能的发布，从而使政府基本上拥有了对公司创新和产品改进方式的否决权。（政府甚至可以阻止公司淘汰服务或删除数据。）所有这些都是秘密进行的，公司被禁止在政府允许之前透露它，而这个行动声称将可执行性扩展到非英国公司，修正案进一步扩展了留存和这些通知，加剧了公司面临的挑战。再加上每个通知附带的禁言令，这产生了几个影响，包括非英国公司无法通知其母国政府该要求，即使这一要求违反母国法律，也阻止了任何形式的外交援助。

    that the purpose of the amendments is to “ensure continuity of lawful access to
    data against a background of changing technology.” It’s understandable that the
    U.K. intelligence and law enforcement agencies would like to know about a company’s
    research and business plans, and have a say in whether and how a company makes
    a change that has serious implications for their weighty missions. Both of us
    have worked in law enforcement, and we know how important, and how difficult,
    the jobs of public safety officials are. There’s no reason to think that the intentions
    behind the bill are anything but noble. This proposed power, however, goes too
    far and is counterproductive.

- en: First, there’s no case that this extraordinary power would solve any existing
    problem. Most providers are quite transparent about product launches, feature
    additions, and removals. Many companies have entire conferences to loudly trumpet
    what is coming, or at least issue announcements through blog posts and press releases.
    In addition, there’s no shortage of dialogue between the U.K. government and technology
    providers. In October 2023, U.K. security officials and their Five Eyes partners
    (the United States, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand) made a high-level and
    [highly publicized](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ikh3ncJZPTU) [visit](https://www.fbi.gov/news/press-releases/fbi-hosts-five-eyes-summit-to-launch-drive-to-secure-innovation-in-response-to-intelligence-threats)

    including espionage threats from China. On top of there being no clear problem
    to solve, the amendments could chill companies from engaging with the government
    in this otherwise healthy exchange about technological innovations for fear of
    enticing the government to issue a notification notice. The open cooperative dynamic
    is at risk of being replaced by one that is defensive and adversarial.

  zh: 首先，没有任何案例表明这种特殊权力将解决任何现有问题。大多数供应商对产品推出、功能增加和删除都相当透明。许多公司都会举办整个会议，高声宣传即将推出的产品，或者至少通过博客文章和新闻稿发布公告。此外，英国政府和技术供应商之间并不缺乏对话。2023年10月，英国安全官员及其五眼联盟伙伴（美国、加拿大、澳大利亚和新西兰）曾高调拜访了加利福尼亚州帕洛阿尔托的技术公司，讨论了从中国发起的间谍威胁等一系列安全话题。此外，没有任何明显的问题需要解决，修正案可能会让公司因为担心引诱政府发出通知而不敢与政府进行这种本来健康的关于技术创新的交流。开放的合作动态有可能被一种防御性和对抗性的动态所取代。
- en: Second, this new product approval regime could harm British users and other
    users around the world. A company that ultimately must capitulate to the surveillance
    demands of the government may end up offering services that are less secure generally,
    susceptible to compromise by bad actors, state sponsored or otherwise. Perhaps
    as a result, the U.K. will have its narrow surveillance needs met at a particular
    moment in time, but this would come at a great cost to those users specifically,
    and cybersecurity generally. One of us has [testified](https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/committee-activity/hearings/reforming-the-electronic-communications-privacy-act)

    for society, while also working to [find](https://carnegieendowment.org/2019/09/10/moving-encryption-policy-conversation-forward-pub-79573)
    a more effective path forward for everyone. This bill, if enacted, could easily

  zh: 其次，这种新的产品批准制度可能会损害英国用户和全球其他用户的利益。一家最终必须向政府的监视要求屈服的公司可能最终会提供的服务在一般情况下不太安全，容易受到不良行为者、国家赞助或其他方面的威胁。也许作为结果，英国将在特定时刻满足其狭隘的监视需求，但这将以对这些用户特别是对网络安全普遍造成巨大的代价。我们中的一位已经在国会作证，另一位已经就加密对于增强社会网络安全的重要性发表了长篇文章，同时也在努力寻找更有效的前进道路。例如，这项法案如果通过，很容易就会被用来扼制加密技术的增加使用来保护数据安全和隐私。
- en: Third, enacting this bill will seemingly legitimize this heavy-handed approach
    for countries less steeped in the rule of law and with a lower regard for human
    rights. Should the current version of the amendments pass, even if U.K. authorities
    adhere in exemplary fashion to human rights and privacy concerns, other security
    services, especially in authoritarian-leaning countries, will not. They could
    endeavor to replicate the U.K.’s secretive power in order to undermine product
    security for their own aims, not only to surveil users but also to censor their
    communications. No country should expect it will necessarily be the beneficiary
    of the use of this new power to control and direct product development. It’s purportedly
    designed for use by the U.K. and for the U.K., though resulting insecurities will
    be there for any actor to exploit if they can find them.

  zh: 第三，通过这项法案将似乎合法化这种对法治水平较低、对人权重视较低的国家采用高压手段的做法。即使英国当局在模范地遵守人权和隐私问题，通过的当前版本的修正案，其他安全服务，特别是在威权倾向国家，将不会如此。他们可能努力复制英国的秘密权力，来破坏产品安全，不仅是监视用户，也是审查他们的通讯。没有国家应该指望他们会必然成为利用这种新权力控制和指导产品发展的受益者。它据称是为英国设计和使用的，但如果有人能找到它们，结果上的不安全性将供任何行为者利用。
- en: The proposal also runs counter to other [efforts](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/2023-10/SecureByDesign_1025_508c.pdf)
    by numerous governments—including the U.K.—to urge the private sector to find
    better ways to substantially enhance cybersecurity on a more sustainable basis.
    Instead of doing that, the bill, as currently drafted, jeopardizes data security
    and privacy in pursuit of an understandable goal of helping law enforcement and
    intelligence agencies’ legitimate objectives. But no one needs a law that could
    limit future progress on much-needed security enhancements, such as through the
    increased use of encryption. The bill needs to be fixed.
