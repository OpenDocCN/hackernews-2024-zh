    walking toward Washington Square. The sun was warm, even though it was November,
    and everything looked like Sunday morning--the buses, and the well-dressed people
    walking slowly in couples and the quiet buildings with the windows closed.

- en: Michael held Frances' arm tightly as they walked downtown in the sunlight. They
    walked lightly, almost smiling, because they had slept late and had a good breakfast
    and it was Sunday. Michael unbuttoned his coat and let it flap around him in the
    mild wind. They walked, without saying anything, among the young and pleasant-looking
    people who somehow seem to make up most of the population of that section of New
    York City.
