    costs — a key benchmark for affordability — with the financial strain rising the
    fastest for middle-class tenants. That’s according to a new report from the Harvard
    Joint Center for Housing Studies, which found that the number of such renters,
    considered to be “cost-burdened,” hit a record 22.4 million in 2022 — up 2 million
    from just three years before. And of those households, 12.1 million had housing
    costs that ate up more than 50 percent of their income, an all-time high for those
    with “severe burdens.”

  zh: 美国一半的租房者将30％以上的收入用于住房成本——这是可负担性的一个关键标准——对于中产阶级租户而言，财务压力上升最快。这是根据哈佛大学联合住房研究中心的一份新报告得出的结论，该报告发现，被认为是“成本负担重”的这类租房者数量在2022年达到了创纪录的2240万，比仅仅三年前增加了200万。而在这些家庭中，1210万个家庭的住房成本占据了收入的50％以上，这是“严重负担”人数的历史新高。
