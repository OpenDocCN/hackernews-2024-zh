  zh: 哈佛商学院对行为科学家Francesca Gino的调查报告本周公开，详细披露了该机构如何得出结论，认为该教授在一系列论文中犯下研究不端行为。

- en: Gino has strenuously denied that she ever altered or falsified data. Her lawyer,

    the committee was that the perpetrator could have been someone else — someone
    who had access to her computer, online data-storage account, and/or data files.

  zh: 根据日期为2023年3月7日的报告，Gino向委员会的主要辩护之一是，实施者可能是其他人 - 某人能访问她的计算机，在线数据存储账户和/或数据文件。
- en: 'Gino named a professor as the most likely suspect. The person’s name was redacted
    in the released report, but she is identified as a female professor who was a
    co-author of Gino’s on a 2012 now-retracted paper about inducing honest behavior
    by prompting people to sign a form at the top rather than at the bottom. According
    to the report, Gino said that the scholar had access to Gino’s online data-storage
    account, as well as a “motive”: Allegedly, she was “angry” at Gino for “not sufficiently
    defending” one of their collaborators “against perceived attacks by another co-author”
    concerning an experiment in the paper.'

  zh: Gino认为一名教授最有可能是嫌疑人。 这位人士的姓名在发布的报告中被删除，但她被认为是Gino在2012年共同撤回的一篇关于通过让人们在顶部而不是底部签署表单诱导诚实行为的论文的合著者。
    根据报告，Gino表示这位学者可以访问她的在线数据存储账户，并有“动机”：据称，她对Gino“未能充分为另一位合著者所认为的实验攻击”感到“愤怒”。
- en: But the investigation committee did not see a “plausible motive” for the other
    professor to have committed misconduct by falsifying Gino’s data. “Gino presented
    no evidence of any data falsification actions by actors with malicious intentions,”
    the committee wrote. “She offered only speculation that one or more such actors
    were responsible for the data anomalies and discrepancies at issue in the allegations.”

  zh: 但是调查委员会并未找到其他教授伪造Gino数据的“合理动机”。 “Gino未提供任何证据表明恶意行为者篡改了数据。” 委员会写道。“她只是推测，可能有一个或多个这样的行为者负责处理涉及指控的数据异常和不一致性。”
- en: 'Gino’s other main defense, according to the report: Honest errors may have
    occurred when her research assistants were coding, checking, or cleaning the data.
    Gino told the investigators that if such errors had occurred, she would take full
    responsibility as the principal investigator.'

  zh: 根据报告，Gino的另一个主要辩护是：她的研究助理在编码、检查或清理数据时可能发生了诚实错误。Gino告诉调查人员，如果确实发生了这样的错误，她将全权负责作为主要调查员。

    of [research assistant] error that we find persuasive in explaining the major
    anomalies and discrepancies.”

  zh: 然而，委员会再次写道，“她没有提供任何我们认为能够解释主要异常和不一致性的[研究助理]错误的证据。”
- en: Over all, the committee determined “by a preponderance of the evidence” that
    Gino “significantly departed from accepted practices of the relevant research
    community and committed research misconduct intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly”
    for five alleged instances of misconduct across the four papers. The committee’s
    findings were unanimous, except in one instance. For the 2012 paper about [signing
    a form at the top](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1209746109), Gino was
    alleged to have falsified or fabricated the results for one study by removing
    or altering descriptions of the study procedures from drafts of the manuscript
    submitted for publication, thus misrepresenting the procedures in the final version.
    Gino acknowledged that there could have been an honest error on her part. One
    committee member felt that the “burden of proof” was not met while the two other
    members believed that research misconduct had, in fact, been committed.

  zh: 总体上，委员会“凭借大量证据”认定Gino在四篇论文中的五次研究不端行为“明显偏离了相关研究社区的公认实践，并且是故意的、知情的或者鲁莽的”。委员会的发现是一致的，只有一个例外。对于2012年关于在[表格顶部签名](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1209746109)的论文，Gino被指控在一项研究中删除或修改了手稿提交出版的描述，从而在最终版本中歪曲了程序。Gino承认这可能是她的一个诚实错误。一个委员会成员认为“证据的责任证明”没有达到，而另外两名委员会成员认为确实存在研究不端行为。
- en: 'After joining the faculty of the Harvard Business School in 2010, Gino became
    a prolific researcher and in-demand expert on matters of workplace management
    and behavioral issues, including dishonesty. But in June 2023, Harvard put her
    on administrative leave — stripping her of her salary and endowed faculty title
    and barring her from campus — after finding that she had committed research misconduct
    in four papers. Among those papers’ findings: The motives people have when networking
    affects how they feel about doing it; feeling inauthentic leads people to feel
    more impure; acting dishonestly can enhance creativity; and signing a form at
    the top leads to more honest self-reporting.'

  zh: 在2010年加入哈佛商学院教职后，Gino成为了一位多产的研究者，并且在职场管理和行为问题上成为了备受需求的专家，包括诚信问题。但是在2023年6月，哈佛大学对她进行了行政休假——停发她的薪水和捐赠的教职称号，并且禁止她进入校园——原因是发现她在四篇论文中存在研究不端行为。这些论文的发现包括：人们在网络建立时的动机影响他们对此的感受；感到不真实会导致人们感觉更不纯洁；不诚实的行为可以增强创造力；以及在表格顶部签名会导致更诚实的自我报告。

- en: Harvard had initially submitted the report in October as part of a partial motion
    to dismiss Gino’s lawsuit, which alleged that she had been defamed, that she had
    been the subject of gender discrimination, and that Harvard had breached her contract.
    Gino had argued to keep the report sealed, but Judge Myong J. Joun, of the U.S.
    District Court for the District of Massachusetts, ruled this week that it is a
    judicial record “to which there exists a presumptive right of public access.”

  zh: 哈佛大学最初在十月份提交了这份报告，作为对吉诺诉讼部分驳回动议的一部分。吉诺声称她遭到诽谤，遭到性别歧视，并称哈佛违反了她的合同。吉诺曾主张保持报告封闭，但马萨诸塞州联邦地区法院法官明咏·J·琼本周裁定这是一份司法记录，“存在公众访问的推定权利”。
