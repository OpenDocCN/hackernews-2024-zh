    including a May 17, 2013, contribution defining it as “only slightly cold, flip-side of lukewarm.”

  zh: Urban Dictionary，一个协作性俚语参考，有几个“lukecool”的条目，包括2013年5月17日的一个定义它为“只是稍微凉，‘lukewarm’的反面。”贡献者举例说：“空调系统可能需要加一些冷媒，房间里只是有点冷酷。”
- en: The word occasionally appears in formal writing and speech. For example, Harold
    Leventhal, a US Appeals Court judge for the District of Columbia, has observed
    that nonlawyers “are ‘lukecool,’ if not hostile, to lawyers” (from “The Lawyer
    in Government,” a speech delivered Oct. 15, 1971).

    is between those who are luke-warm and those who perhaps can be described as ‘luke-cool.’
    At a straw vote taken at the Council for British Archaeology on January 8th, 32
    declared themselves to be luke-warm as against 14 who are luke-cool, and this
    sort of split seems to be fairly general.”

- en: In *English Lexicogenesis* (2014), an analysis of word formation, the linguist
    D. Gary Miller notes that “some words do not exist despite an obvious need.” One
    of the gaps he mentions is “(*)*lukecool* in the face of *lukewarm*, a very old
    word in English.” The parenthetical asterisk indicates that “lukecool” is considered
    nonstandard.

  zh: 在《English Lexicogenesis》（2014）中，语言学家D. Gary Miller分析了词形成，指出“有些词尽管显然需要，但并不存在。”他提到的空缺之一是“(*)‘lukecool’与‘lukewarm’面对面的问题，尽管‘lukewarm’是英语中一个非常古老的词。”括号里的星号表示“lukecool”被认为是非标准的。
- en: “Nothing but tradition makes *luke* acceptable as a qualifier of warmth but
    not coolness,” Miller writes. “Since only tradition stands in the way of *lukecool*,
    there is no reason it could not become generally accepted if enough people started
    using it.”

  zh: “除了传统，没有别的东西能让‘luke’作为温暖的修饰语被接受而不是‘cool’。”米勒写道。“既然只有传统阻碍了‘lukecool’的使用，如果足够多的人开始使用它，它完全可以变得普遍接受。”
- en: Yes, the people who speak a language ultimately determine what’s acceptable.
    But we think Miller may be too dismissive of the long association of “luke” with
    “warm.”

  zh: 是的，说一种语言的人最终决定了什么是可以接受的。但我们认为米勒对“luke”与“warm”长期的联系可能过于轻视。
- en: In fact, “luke” by itself originally meant moderately warm, so “lukewarm” is
    etymologically a puffed-up, or pleonastic, version of “luke.” And “lukecool” is
    etymologically an oxymoron, or contradiction in terms. However, most English speakers
    today are probably unaware of the warmish origin of “luke,” and may believe it
    means something like “sort of.”
