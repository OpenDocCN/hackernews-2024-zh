- en: When I started writing and publishing open-source software about 15 years ago,
    I was pretty radical about it. I only used permissive licenses like MIT or BSD,
    as all I cared about was reach. Using a copyleft license with strings attached
    seemed to hinder that reach. Getting another A-category company to use my open-source
    libraries like [Nodemailer](https://nodemailer.com/?ref=docs.emailengine.app)
    was a badge of honor. I even went so far that when a founder of a major transactional
    email service sent me an email regarding Nodemailer and offered to make a donation
    to promote my efforts, I rejected it. I did not want to seem affected by one of
    the dominant providers because this would not be fair to other providers.

  zh: 大约15年前，我开始写和发布开源软件时，我对此非常激进。我只使用像MIT或BSD这样的宽松许可证，因为我只关心能够影响的范围。使用带有附加条件的Copyleft许可证似乎会阻碍这一影响。让另一个A类公司使用我的开源库，比如[Nodemailer](https://nodemailer.com/?ref=docs.emailengine.app)，是一种荣誉。我甚至做得更过分，当一家主要交易邮件服务的创始人给我发了一封关于Nodemailer的电子邮件，并提出捐款以促进我的工作时，我拒绝了。我不想因为一个主导提供者的影响而显得受到影响，因为这对其他提供者不公平。

- en: In any case, it changed years later when a startup using Nodemailer was acquired
    for half a billion dollars. I was financially not in a good place back then, and
    when I saw the news, I started to wonder – what did I get out of this? Sending
    email notifications was a huge part of that service, and they probably sent millions
    of email notifications a day using Nodemailer. At the very least, I saved them
    tons of developer hours by providing a free and solid library for sending these
    emails. I searched my mailbox for emails related to that company and found a single
    complaint about a feature. No pull requests, no donations, no nothing. And there
    was nowhere to complain either as I had knowingly given my software for the world
    to use with no requirements to compensate anything. My empty wallet was not happy
    about the turn of events.

  zh: 无论如何，几年后当一家使用Nodemailer的初创公司被收购达到50亿美元时，情况发生了变化。那时我的经济状况并不好，当我看到新闻时，我开始思考——我从中得到了什么？发送电子邮件通知是该服务的重要组成部分，他们可能每天使用Nodemailer发送数百万封电子邮件通知。至少，我通过提供一个免费且可靠的库来发送这些电子邮件，节省了他们大量的开发人员时间。我搜索我的邮箱，找到了与该公司相关的一封投诉邮件。没有pull
    requests，没有捐款，什么都没有。而且我也无处申诉，因为我知ingly地免费提供了我的软件供全世界使用，没有任何补偿要求。我的空空如也的钱包并不满意这一转变的事件。
- en: So, when I started what eventually became [EmailEngine](https://emailengine.app/?ref=docs.emailengine.app),
    I tried to cover my back as much as possible. I released the software under the
    copyleft AGPL license. I also set up an automated CLA process so that no one was
    able to get their PR merged without signing a CLA first. Many people hate CLAs,
    and several persons opened a PR first but closed it once they realized that there
    was a CLA requirement. Well, to be honest, I didn't really care. For example,
    98.1% of the code for Nodemailer was written by myself, and only 1.9% was from
    other contributors, so not getting PRs merged was not a major issue. For EmailEngine,
    after a year and a half of being published as open source, the same numbers were
    99.8% vs 0.2%.

  zh: 因此，当我开始创办最终成为[EmailEngine](https://emailengine.app/?ref=docs.emailengine.app)的项目时，我尽可能地防范风险。我选择了在Copyleft
    AGPL许可下发布软件。我还建立了自动化的CLA流程，以确保没有人能在签署CLA之前就合并其PR。很多人都不喜欢CLA，有几个人开了PR，但一旦意识到需要签署CLA，就关闭了它。坦白说，我并不在意。例如，Nodemailer有98.1%的代码是我自己写的，只有1.9%来自其他贡献者，所以无法合并PR并不是什么大问题。对于EmailEngine来说，开源发布一年半后，这个比例是99.8%对0.2%。

- en: Obviously, I wanted to make some money from my new project, and my business
    plan was simple. I published the project (it was called IMAP API at that time)
    as an AGPL-licensed application. I also offered an MIT version, but to get that,
    you had to subscribe. The subscription fee was 250€ per year. My assumption was
    that companies - the main target for the software - do not like copyleft licenses
    and would convert to the permissive license once they see how useful the app is.

  zh: 显然，我希望从我的新项目中赚些钱，我的商业计划很简单。我将该项目（当时称为IMAP API）发布为AGPL许可的应用程序。我还提供了MIT版本，但要获得它，您必须订阅。订阅费用为250欧元/年。我假设公司
    - 这款软件的主要目标用户 - 不喜欢copyleft许可证，一旦他们看到这个应用有多有用，他们就会转向宽松许可证。
- en: Well, it turns out my business plan was bonkers. I only gained a few paying
    subscribers, and it seemed to me those people weren't even using IMAP API. They
    just wanted to support my effort. It turned out that smaller companies did not
    care about the license at all, and larger companies were not using it. After a
    year and a half and 750€ in total revenue, I decided to jump ship — enough of
    providing free stuff.

  zh: 结果证明，我的商业计划是荒唐的。我只获得了少数付费订阅者，而且那些人似乎甚至没有使用IMAP API。事实证明，小公司根本不关心许可证，而大公司也没有使用它。经过一年半和总共750欧元的收入后，我决定放弃这个项目
    - 不再提供免费的东西。
- en: I re-designed the UI of the app to look more professional and implemented a
    license key system. From that moment if you wanted to use EmailEngine (the new
    name for IMAP API), you needed a license key that was only available for paying
    subscribers. I also changed the license from AGPL to a commercial license. The
    source code is still published publicly on [GitHub](https://github.com/postalsys/emailengine?ref=docs.emailengine.app).
    It is no longer *open-source* by definition but *source-available*. This change
    of license was only possible due to requiring outside committers to sign a CLA
    from the start.

  zh: 我重新设计了应用的用户界面，使其看起来更加专业，并实施了许可密钥系统。从那时起，如果您想要使用EmailEngine（IMAP API的新名称），您需要一个仅限付费订阅者使用的许可密钥。我还将许可证从AGPL更改为商业许可证。源代码仍然公开发布在[GitHub](https://github.com/postalsys/emailengine?ref=docs.emailengine.app)上。按定义来说，它不再是*开源*的，而是*源代码可用*的。这种许可证的变更只有在要求外部贡献者从一开始签署CLA的情况下才能实现。
- en: I still publish MIT-licensed projects, but only for smaller tools, not larger
    projects. The goal of these tools is to promote my main effort. For example, I
    extracted the IMAP client functions from EmailEngine and published it under an
    MIT license as a generic IMAP client library for Node.js. This module  ([ImapFlow](https://imapflow.com/?ref=docs.emailengine.app))
    is gaining steam in adoption as it is by far better than any pre-existing alternative.
    The documentation page sends about 100 visitors per month to EmailEngine's homepage,
    which is not much, but hey, it is free traffic, and sometimes these visitors do
    convert, making the effort fruitful.

  zh: 我仍然发布MIT许可证的项目，但只针对较小的工具，而不是较大的项目。这些工具的目标是推广我的主要工作。例如，我从EmailEngine中提取了IMAP客户端功能，并以Node.js的通用IMAP客户端库的MIT许可证发布。这个模块（[ImapFlow](https://imapflow.com/?ref=docs.emailengine.app)）在采用上正在获得动力，因为它远比任何现有的替代品更好。文档页面每月向EmailEngine的主页发送大约100名访问者，这并不多，但这是免费流量，有时这些访问者会转化，使得这一努力是值得的。

    and finally 895€. To my surprise, it did not mean getting fewer customers. I guess
    any sub-$1k amount for businesses is peanuts, so the only thing these price increases
    changed was improving the revenue.

  zh: 接下来，我开始提高价格：250欧元变成495欧元，然后是695欧元和795欧元，最后是895欧元。令我惊讶的是，这并没有意味着客户减少。我猜想对于企业来说，任何低于1000欧元的金额都不值一提，因此这些价格上涨改变的唯一是提高了收入。
- en: The current MRR for EmailEngine is 6100€ and grows steadily, which in Estonia,
    where I live, allows me to pay myself a decent salary so that I can work on my
    project full-time. The only regret I have is that I did not start selling my software
    earlier and only published free, open-source software. Yes, I have some sponsors
    in GitHub, but it has never been a substantial amount, ranging from $50-$750 per
    month, depending on how many sponsors I happen to have. Selling to business customers
    is definitely more reliable and predictable than depending on the goodwill of
    random people.

    GitHub 上有一些赞助者，但金额从每月 $50 到 $750 不等，并不是很多，取决于我当时有多少赞助者。销售给商业客户明显比依赖随机人们的好意更为可靠和可预测。
