    and a sharper focus, instead, on reducing the harm that drugs cause to their users.

    by multiple backers, most prominently the [Drug Policy Alliance, based in New
    York](https://drugpolicy.org/more-about-decriminalization/). Supporters hoped
    that ending penalties—and reducing the associated stigma of drug use—would bring
    a range of benefits. Once drugs were decriminalized and destigmatized, the thinking
    went, those who wanted to continue using would be more willing to access harm-reduction
    services that helped them use in safer ways. Meanwhile, the many people who wanted
    to quit using drugs but had been too ashamed or fearful to seek treatment would
    do so. Advocates foresaw a surge of help-seeking, a reduction in drug-overdose
    deaths, fewer racial disparities in the health and criminal-justice systems, lower
    rates of incarceration, and safer neighborhoods for all.

    Fentanyl and meth addiction are not like depression, chronic pain, or cancer,
    conditions for which people are typically motivated to seek treatment. Even as
    it destroys a person’s life, addictive drug use by definition feels good in the
    short term, and most addicted people resist or are ambivalent about giving that
    up. Withdrawal, meanwhile, is wrenchingly difficult. As a result, most addicted
    people who come to treatment do so not spontaneously but through pressure from
    family, friends, employers, health professionals, and, yes, the law.

  zh: 我们并不惊讶于无关紧要的压力寻求治疗是无效的。芬太尼和甲基苯丙胺（meth）成瘾不像抑郁症、慢性疼痛或癌症，这些情况通常会激励人们寻求治疗。即使它摧毁了一个人的生活，成瘾性药物的使用在短期内确实令人愉悦，大多数成瘾者对放弃这种感觉抱有抵触或矛盾的态度。与此同时，戒断反应是极其困难的。因此，大多数来接受治疗的成瘾者不是自发的，而是在家庭、朋友、雇主、健康专业人士，以及法律的压力下才这样做。

    also did not understand Oregon, a state in which the measure’s biggest funders

    because Oregon had never fought such a war. In 1973, it became the first state
    to decriminalize possession of marijuana. When federal and state mandatory-minimum
    sentences for drug crimes flowered in the ’80s and ’90s, Oregon went the other
    way, making it impossible for someone to go to prison for simple drug possession.
    Overall, the state had the country’s [lowest rate of imprisonment for nonviolent

    in truth they are more like a dial with many intervening settings. That dial can
    be productively turned in many parts of the country. Many states are far more
    punitive toward drug users than Oregon was before Measure 110 passed. They overemphasize
    incarceration of people who use drugs, they do not provide adequate, publicly
    funded health treatment and health insurance, and they do not use criminal justice
    productively to discourage drug use (for instance, by using arrests and probations
    as leverage to get people into drug courts and treatment). If these states could
    be persuaded to dial down their criminal-justice approach to approximate what
    Oregon had *before* Measure 110**,** except with adequately funded, evidence-based
    prevention and treatment, substantial gains in public health and safety would
    likely follow. The future of successful drug-policy reform is not greater laxity
    in states that are already quite progressive in their approach to drug use; it
    is using criminal justice and public health together in a balanced, pragmatic
    fashion, as Oregon is now poised to do.
