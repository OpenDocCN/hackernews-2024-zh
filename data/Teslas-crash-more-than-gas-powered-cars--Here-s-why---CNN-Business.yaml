    and replacing them with gasoline vehicles. One reason the company gave was that
    drivers kept crashing the cars.

  zh: 赫兹最近宣布，将从其车队中卖出2万辆电动汽车，并用汽油车替换它们。公司给出的一个原因是司机不断地撞车。
- en: Hertz CEO Stephen Scherr noted that the costs of repairs of an electric vehicle
    are also much higher. And Hertz’s step back from EV sales indicate a broader problem
    for the EV industry. Researchers at LexisNexis Risk Solutions looking at insurance
    data have found that, evidently, rental car drivers aren’t the only ones having
    issues keeping EVs in one piece.

  zh: 赫兹CEO斯蒂芬·谢尔（Stephen Scherr）指出，电动汽车的维修成本也要高得多。赫兹暂停电动汽车销售表明电动汽车行业存在更广泛的问题。LexisNexis
    Risk Solutions的研究人员通过分析保险数据发现，租车司机不是唯一一个在使用电动汽车时出现问题的人。
- en: Scherr’s statementsechoed findings by insurance analysts at LexisNexis who found
    that, when vehicle owners switch from gasoline-powered cars to electric cars,
    they tend to crash more. Drivers also tend to crash somewhat more when switching
    to gas-powered vehicles, too, but the increase is more pronounced with EVs. The
    frequency of insurance claims rises by about 14.3% while the severity of claims,
    or the amount that has to be paid out, increases by 14.5%, according to the data.

  zh: 谢尔的声明与LexisNexis的保险分析师的发现相呼应，后者发现，当车主从汽油动力车转向电动车时，他们往往更容易发生事故。当驾驶员转向汽油动力车时，事故发生率也会略微增加，但与电动车相比，增幅更大。根据数据，保险索赔频率上升约为14.3%，索赔严重程度，即必须支付的金额增加了14.5%。
- en: The increase in incidents is highest during the first year or so after drivers
    get the new electric vehicle, but then tapers off after that, according to LexisNexis,
    presumably as people get used to driving the new model. There is much less of
    a problem when a driver changes from a gasoline-powered vehicle to another gas-powered
    one, they found.

  zh: 根据LexisNexis的数据，事故发生率在驾驶员获得新电动汽车后的第一年左右最高，然后在此后逐渐减少，可能是因为人们逐渐适应了驾驶新型号车辆。他们发现，当驾驶员从汽油动力车辆换成另一种汽油动力车辆时，问题要少得多。
- en: In both cases – with Hertz and with LexisNexis – “electric vehicles” largely
    means Teslas. Teslas accounted for 80% of Hertz’s EV fleet. Among privately owned
    electric vehicles, Teslas also make up the majority, given that they make up the
    majority of all new EVs sold in the US.

- en: That suggests there may be something about Teslas that’s causing people to crash
    more than other cars. But LexisNexis researchers had previously noticed similar
    trends in China, where there are many more EVs – including more that aren’t Teslas.

- en: In its research, LexisNexis looked at insurance claims for new electric vehicles
    that replaced a gas vehicle in a household. As much as possible, the analysts

    model, indicating that regularly switching from one to another exacerbates the
    issues. And the fact that crash frequency lessens with time also suggests that
    unfamiliarity has something to do with it, said Xiaohui Lu, head of EV research

  zh: 在同时拥有汽油车和电动车的家庭中，事故甚至更为频繁，表明经常从一辆车换到另一辆车会加剧问题。而事故发生率随时间的推移而减少的事实也表明，不熟悉情况可能与此有关，LexisNexis
    Risk Solutions的电动汽车研究负责人卢晓晖表示，
- en: The Highway Loss Data Institute, a US-based organization funded by the insurance
    industry, has not found higher crash rates for Tesla vehicles or other EVs more
    broadly based on overall insurance claims. Teslas do tend to have higher claim
    costs, though, according to the HLDI.

- en: In many ways, there is little difference between driving an internal combustion-powered
    vehicle and an electric model like a Tesla. There is a brake pedal and an accelerator
    pedal and a steering wheel. But there are some key differences between driving
    a Tesla, as well as some other electric models, and driving gasoline-powered cars.

  zh: 在很多方面，驾驶内燃机动力车辆和特斯拉等电动车型之间几乎没有区别。有制动踏板和油门踏板以及方向盘。但是驾驶特斯拉以及其他一些电动车型和驾驶汽油车之间存在一些关键区别。
- en: For instance, Tesla vehicles do not have a “Start” button to turn the vehicle
    on and off. Instead, once the driver sits in the vehicle it is instantly on and
    is ready to drive. When thedriver gets out, the vehicle turns itself off. Since
    it’s an electric vehicle, meaning there’s no engine sound or vibration, the difference
    between on and off can sometimes be harder to discern.

  zh: 例如，特斯拉汽车没有“启动”按钮来开启和关闭车辆。相反，一旦驾驶员坐在车内，车辆立即启动并准备好行驶。当驾驶员下车时，车辆会自动关闭。由于它是电动车辆，意味着没有引擎声音或振动，因此有时很难区分开启和关闭状态。
- en: Perhaps more importantly, for insurance purposes, said Lu, electric vehicles
    such as Teslas tend to be fast. With their powerful electric motors, they can
    accelerate much more quickly than typical gasoline-powered vehicles.

- en: For instance, a Tesla Model 3 Long Range, not even a particularly performance-oriented
    version, can go from zero to 60 miles an hour in 4.1 seconds, according to Car
    and Driver. The BMW 330i, by comparison, takes more than a second longer to reach
    that speed. The Tesla Model 3 Performance can do it in 3.1 seconds, according
    to Car and Driver’s tests. That kind of quickness was, before Tesla, associated
    with high-performance sports cars.

  zh: 例如，根据《汽车与驾驶员》杂志的测试，特斯拉Model 3 Long Range，即使不是特别注重性能的版本，可以在4.1秒内从零加速到60英里/小时。相比之下，宝马330i需要超过一秒的时间才能达到这个速度。据《汽车与驾驶员》杂志的测试，特斯拉Model
    3 Performance可以在3.1秒内完成。在特斯拉之前，这种速度通常与高性能跑车相关联。
- en: In the insurance business, there is a long-established connection between horsepower
    and the frequency and amount of insurance claims. Fast cars hit things more often
    and they hit them harder, leading to more – and more severe – crashes. Added to
    this, EVs lack the usual engine sounds that go along with rapid acceleration and
    high speeds, so it’s conceivable drivers are less aware of how fast they’re going.

- en: High speeds aren’t even necessarily the issue, said Lu. Controlling speed is
    especially critical in low-speed environments, like a parking garages, with other
    cars and concrete posts all around. With gas cars, starting off from a stop requires
    the engine to rev up a bit before the car can start moving. Not so with EVs, which
    respond differently to pedal pressure.

  zh: 控制车速并不一定是问题，路说道。在低速环境中，比如停车场，周围到处都是其他汽车和混凝土柱子，控制速度尤其关键。对于汽油车来说，从停止状态启动需要引擎先稍微转动一下才能开始移动。但是对于电动汽车来说，对踏板的压力产生不同的反应。
- en: “Most drivers are trained in driving [internal combustion] vehicles and they’re
    applying the habitual amount of pressure on the driving pedal but the behavior
    is very different, particularly in low-speed zones,” said Lu.

  zh: “大多数驾驶员都是在驾驶[内燃]车辆时接受训练的，并且他们会在行驶踏板上施加习惯性的压力，但是行为却非常不同，尤其在低速区域，”路说。
- en: Electric vehicles can also have so-called “one-pedal driving” that slows the
    vehicle rapidly when the driver lifts off the accelerator pedal rather than simply
    allowing it to coast. Getting used to using just one pedal for both starting and
    stopping can lead to confusion in emergency situations when a quick slam on the
    actual brake pedal is needed.

  zh: 电动汽车也可以采用所谓的“单踏板驾驶”，当驾驶员松开油门踏板时，车辆会迅速减速，而不仅仅是让车辆滑行。习惯于只用一个踏板来启动和停止可能会在紧急情况下引起困惑，当需要快速踩下实际的刹车踏板时。

    than three years of experience, said Lu.
