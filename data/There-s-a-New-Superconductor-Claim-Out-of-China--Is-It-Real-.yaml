- en: In theory, science is an entirely rational and transparent undertaking. Scientists
    gather data, form hypotheses, and then collect more data to find out which hypothesis
    is correct. That’s the idea, anyway. In practice, real-life science is messy and
    often opaque. Data can be ambiguous. Scientists can be bull-headed. The process
    of shifting consensus has always been as much about politics and intellectual
    fashion as about theory and data. Now throw in social media, fanboy culture, preprint
    archives, and virality — you have a world that breeds all kinds of oddities that
    can pop up, disappear, and reemerge like quantum virtual particles. All sorts
    of wild discoveries are bouncing around the information ecosystem before any peer-reviewed
    journals are able to sort out whether they’re real. And scientists aren’t even
    all on the same page as to whether this is a good thing or not.

  zh: 理论上，科学是一种完全理性和透明的行为。科学家们收集数据，提出假设，然后收集更多数据来找出哪个假设是正确的。那就是理论。然而，在实践中，现实中的科学是混乱的，常常是不透明的。数据可能存在歧义。科学家可能固执己见。转变共识的过程一直与政治和知识时尚一样多，与理论和数据一样。现在加入社交媒体、粉丝文化、预印本存档和病毒性传播，你就有了一个培育各种奇怪现象的世界，这些奇怪现象可以像量子虚拟粒子一样突然出现、消失和重新出现。在任何同行评议的期刊能够搞清楚它们是否真实之前，各种狂野的发现都在信息生态系统中弹来弹去。而科学家们甚至没有完全达成一致，认为这是好事还是坏事。

    a South Korean team that said it had [discovered](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.12008)
    a material that was superconductive at room temperature and pressure. Bolstering

  zh: 去年夏天，一场快闪科学活动的一次迭代爆发了，当时Twitter用户开始炒作一支韩国团队的工作，称他们发现了一种在室温和压力下具有超导性的材料。支持这一说法的是一段视频，显示了一块材料部分悬浮。正如我们当时报道的那样，如果这些发现得到复制，将对像悬浮列车和量子计算等事物产生巨大的实际影响。
- en: 'Then the story collapsed. After numerous teams around the world jumped in to
    try to replicate the study, they found that the material — a crystal of copper,
    lead, and phosphate called LK-99 — appeared to not be a superconductor after all;
    its strange magnetic effects were probably caused by a more mundane phenomenon
    called diamagnetism. “Many things are diamagnetic: plastics, graphite, humans,”
    says Leslie Schoop, a professor of chemistry at Princeton. “There is a famous
    experiment where they made a [frog float](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlJsVqc0ywM)
    over a giant magnet.” Within a week, the story faded.'

  zh: 然后，故事崩溃了。世界各地的许多团队加入进来尝试复制这项研究后，他们发现这种材料 —— 一种叫做 LK-99 的铜、铅和磷的晶体 —— 看起来实际上并不是一个超导体；它奇怪的磁效应可能是由于一种更普通的现象——称为抗磁性的现象引起的。“许多东西都是抗磁性的：塑料、石墨、人类，”普林斯顿大学化学教授莱斯利·斯乔普说。“有一个著名的实验，他们让一只[青蛙漂浮](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlJsVqc0ywM)在一个巨大的磁铁上。”一个星期内，这个故事就消失了。
- en: Or did it? Not everyone had given up hope. In China, several teams were working
    with a similar material, called copper-substituted lead apatite, that had a similar
    chemical formulation to LK-99\. This month they [released a paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00999)
    onto the preprint server arXiv in which they reported that while it didn’t superconduct
    at room temperature, it showed evidence of doing so at temperatures that could
    be achieved by a normal household freezer, which itself would be a huge breakthrough.

  zh: 还是如此吗？并不是每个人都放弃了希望。在中国，有几个团队正在研究一种类似的材料，叫做铜取代铅磷灰石，它的化学配方与 LK-99 相似。本月，他们在预印本服务器
    arXiv 上[发布了一篇论文](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00999)，在其中他们报告说，虽然它在室温下不能超导，但在普通家用冰箱可以达到的温度下表现出了超导的迹象，这本身就是一个巨大的突破。Twitter

    Christian Keil in an X post that garnered 4.1 million views. “It’s more like ‘room

- en: Many scientists who study superconductors for a living rolled their eyes at
    the reappearance of extraordinary claims about LK-99\. Peter Armitage, a professor
    of physics at Johns Hopkins, says there is no reason to think that these materials
    show any promise. “The chance that they have found something to do with superconductivity
    is almost zero. Based on prior knowledge, I would expect that house lint would
    have the same likelihood to be a high-temperature superconductor as LK-99,” he
    says. “The original motivation was flawed, the experimental work was sloppy, and
    upon inspection the prior data showed no evidence for superconductivity at all. So
    why would we expect anything interesting to occur in this class of compounds?
    I think this work should be just completely ignored.”

  zh: 许多以研究超导体为生的科学家对于关于 LK-99 的非凡声明的再次出现皱起了眉头。约翰斯·霍普金斯大学的物理学教授彼得·阿米塔奇表示，没有理由认为这些材料显示出任何希望。“他们发现与超导性有关的可能性几乎为零。基于先前的知识，我预期与
    LK-99 一样可能成为高温超导体的概率与家里的绒球一样，”他说。“最初的动机是错误的，实验工作粗糙，经过检查的先前数据根本没有显示出任何超导性的证据。那么，我们为什么会期待在这类化合物中发生任何有趣的事情呢？我认为这项工作应该完全被忽视。”
- en: “So far most scientists (including me) have been quiet on Twitter as to us it
    is pretty obviously nothing,” says Schoop. “There is no good reason to suspect
    that this class of materials has any promise for high-temperature superconductivity
    based on the data I’ve seen.”

    Sinéad Griffin, a theoretical physicist at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.
    “It seems to be two independent teams that came together and had similar results.

- en: 'Asked what her gut feeling is about whether the superconductivity claims will
    pan out, Griffin responds: “I almost sound like a crazy person when I answer this,

- en: One reason that respectable researchers can hold such different ideas is that
    the field remains full of unanswered questions. At very low temperatures, within
    a few degrees of absolute zero, the phenomenon of superconductivity is fairly
    well understood. According to quantum physics, electrons can merge together into
    a kind of distributed mutual identity called a Cooper pair. This shared identity
    can connect countless quadrillions of electrons into a single entity, which can
    carry a current without any loss of energy. Something similar must occur in higher-temperature
    superconductors as well, but no one has yet come up with a theoretical mechanism
    to explain it. That means it’s not yet possible to create a superconducting material
    from first principles the way, for instance, a drug company might try to create
    a medicine by building a molecule that will work in a known biochemical pathway.

  zh: 使得尊重的研究人员持有如此不同观点的一个原因是，该领域仍然充满了未解答的问题。在非常低的温度下，接近绝对零度，超导现象被相当了解。根据量子物理学，电子可以融合成一种称为库珀对的分布式相互身份。这种共享身份可以将无数的电子连接成一个单一实体，这个实体可以在不损失能量的情况下传输电流。在更高温度的超导体中也会发生类似的事情，但至今还没有人提出一个理论机制来解释它。这意味着还不可能像药物公司试图通过建立一个在已知生化途径中起作用的分子来创造药物那样，从第一原理上创建一个超导材料。
- en: “New classes of superconductors are most often found by accident; they are rarely
    previously predicted. And sometimes, the mechanism for superconductivity is completely
    different from our previous understanding,” says Schoop.

  zh: “新的超导体类别通常是偶然发现的；它们很少被预测。有时，超导性的机制与我们以前的理解完全不同，” Schoop 说。
- en: One major class of well-studied superconducting compounds are copper-oxide ceramics,
    which were discovered in the ’80s. To this day the mechanism by which they work
    isn’t well understood. “People thought there was an upper limit for the temperature
    at which superconductivity can appear, and then copper-oxide ceramics blew through
    this by a lot,” Schoop says. “So we can never rule out that a room-temperature,
    ambient-pressure superconductor can be found, but we don’t have very good ideas
    where to look for it.” There is at present no theoretical upper limit on the temperature
    at which a solid can be superconductive.

  zh: 一个主要研究的超导化合物类别是铜氧陶瓷，这些陶瓷是在80年代发现的。到目前为止，它们的工作机制尚不清楚。“人们以为超导性出现的温度有一个上限，然后铜氧陶瓷大幅突破了这一限制，”
    Schoop 说。“所以我们永远不能排除能找到一种室温、常压超导体，但我们不知道该去哪里寻找。” 目前对于固体可以超导的温度没有理论上的上限。
- en: While some researchers lament the social-media frenzies that erupt over unvetted
    work posted onto arXiv and the like, others feel that the sheer speed with which
    new discoveries can spread make preprint servers worth the occasional annoyance.
    “There is a problem with overhyping things that are not peer reviewed,” says Griffin.
    “But there are severe issues with peer review as well. My longest peer-review
    process was two and a half years. So we just can’t rely on peer review to make
    rapid progress whatsoever.”

- en: Given the huge gaps in our current understanding, it’s entirely possible that
    one or more materials exist that will superconduct at room temperature and pressure,
    but the only way that anyone will find them is through a combination of patience,
