    powerful as an idea than a tool. The digital world just wasn’t as big back then
    as it is now. But to Chayka’s first point, we built the digital world using these
    little devices that didn’t do very much. We made it worth the journey. And meanwhile,
    the object was our companion, and inside was a tiny, *personal* digital world — our
    notes, our messages, our few digital texts. It was not much, but it was ours.

    the virtual and forming a window from reality into the unreal…Where Pokemon and
    Digimon depicted wholly alternate realities — virtual realms that were fun and
    cool, lol — the virtual world of today’s devices has simply overlaid the physical
    like a dense fog…I want a device that is truly personal, in that it is a reflection
    of the self (unique, changing, unstable).”
