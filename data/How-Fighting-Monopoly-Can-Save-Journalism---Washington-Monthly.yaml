    operate as utilities providing every user, or class of users, with the same prices
    and terms of service. Similarly, while granted an exemption from liability for
    the messages people sent over their wires, telecommunications companies were not
    allowed to pick and choose who got to send or receive what content. Americans
    also used antitrust enforcement and utility regulations to prohibit such companies
    from vertically integrating into adjacent lines of businesses, such as advertising
    and publishing. Finally, by the end of the 19th century, privacy laws in every
    state prohibited them from disclosing or otherwise misusing the personal data

    monopolies. In 1934, Congress created the Federal Communications Commission and
    gave it expansive authority to enforce anti-monopoly principles in broadcast markets.
    In the early 1940s, the FCC used these powers to force NBC to divest itself of
    one of its two dominant radio networks, now known as ABC, thereby preventing NBC
    from monopolizing the radio industry. The government also applied the same principle

- en: The FCC similarly put a check on monopoly by preventing the cross-ownership
    of radio, television, and newspaper companies. In 1970, the FCC went further by
    enacting its “Fin-Syn” and Prime Time Access rules. These were aimed at preventing
    the three dominant networks (ABC, CBS, and NBC) from monopolizing the production
    of television programming, including by limiting the number of hours they could
    broadcast their own content in prime time. The rule change led to what many have
    described as a golden age of television, as independent television production
    companies gained the ability to bring groundbreaking programming like *The Mary

    flow of ideas, the FCC also took special measures to ensure that broadcast license
    holders, whose numbers were necessarily limited in any one location, did not suppress
    or monopolize the news and public affairs programming going out over public airwaves.
    Thus, in 1949, the FCC instituted the Fairness Doctrine, which promoted viewpoint
    diversity by requiring that television broadcasters “affirmatively endeavor to
    make … facilities available for the expression of contrasting viewpoints held
    by responsible elements with respect to the controversial issues presented.” The
    Fairness Doctrine created an environment in the image of the Founders’ positivist
    view of the First Amendment by placing the need for a well-informed citizenry

    when it upheld a law requiring cable companies to carry content from broadcast
    stations. Writing for the majority, Justice Anthony Kennedy stated that people,
    not corporations, should decide what they watch, noting, “At the heart of the

  zh: 解决方案是什么？最近，媒体界一直在热议一个备受期待的慈善倡议，名为[媒体前进](https://www.pressforward.news/)。这个项目是由22个主要慈善组织组成的联盟，关注民主未来，他们在去年9月集体承诺每年五年向本地新闻编辑部捐赠1亿美元。尽管这一承诺的规模是前所未有的，并且迫切需要，但这远远不足够。ProPublica的创始合伙人理查德·J·托费尔估计，单单1亿美元可能只是保持小型本地出版物健康所需资金的10%。
- en: Another coalition, [Rebuild Local News](https://www.rebuildlocalnews.org/mission/),
    advocates for an innovative set of policies that would support local journalism
    with tax subsidies. It is specifically asking Congress to provide a $250 refundable
    tax credit for Americans who buy subscriptions to local news outlets and a $2,500
    to $5,000 tax credit for businesses that advertise in local media. The coalition
    also calls for a government-subsidized “super-sized Newsmatch” fund that would
    provide at least a three-to-one match for charitable contributions to local news
    organizations.

  zh: 另一个联盟，[重建本地新闻](https://www.rebuildlocalnews.org/mission/)，倡导一套创新政策，支持通过税收补贴支持本地新闻。它特别要求国会为购买本地新闻订阅的美国人提供250美元可退还税收抵免，以及为在本地媒体上广告的企业提供2500至5000美元的税收抵免。该联盟还呼吁设立政府补贴的“超大型新闻匹配”基金，该基金将至少为本地新闻机构的慈善捐款提供三比一的匹配资助。
- en: Even if this plan came to pass, however, its advocates estimate that it would
    raise no more than [$3 billion to $5 billion](https://www.rebuildlocalnews.org/solutions/our-plan/)
    for local journalism. That would be a godsend to many local publications that
    have lost financial viability, including the many in danger of being devoured
    by vulture capital funds intent on stripping out their last remaining assets.
    But it is nowhere near what’s needed to restore a healthy, sustainable, diverse,
    and independent press when each year Google, Facebook, and other platforms are
    using anticompetitive and often illegal business practices to rob ad revenue and
    editorial content worth many tens of billions.

  zh: 然而，即使该计划实施，其倡导者估计也不会为本地新闻筹集超过[$3 billion to $5 billion](https://www.rebuildlocalnews.org/solutions/our-plan/)。这对于许多已经失去财务可行性的本地出版物来说是一种及时的帮助，包括那些处于被秃鹫资本基金吞并其最后资产的危险中的出版物。但是，这远远不足以在谷歌、Facebook和其他平台每年利用反竞争性和通常非法的商业实践抢走价值数十亿美元的广告收入和编辑内容的情况下，恢复健康、可持续、多样化和独立的新闻界所需的。
- en: Getting to the root cause of journalism’s crisis is not complicated, even if
    it requires us all to raise our sights and see the broader pattern. Simply put,
    it requires returning to the same basic anti-monopoly principles that Americans
    used during previous revolutions in communications technology to preserve our
    First Amendment rights to speak, and to hear the speech of others.

  zh: 解决新闻界危机的根本原因并不复杂，即使这需要我们所有人提高视野，看到更广泛的模式。简单来说，这需要回归美国人在以往通信技术革命期间用来维护我们言论自由权利的同样基本的反垄断原则，以及保障我们听取他人言论的权利。
- en: One of those principles is strict, structural separations between the different
    levels of the information supply chain. Thus, enforcers should use traditional
    antitrust laws to keep all owners of essential infrastructure, including Google,
    Amazon, Facebook, and other digital platforms, out of adjacent lines of business.
    This should include control of businesses that are horizontally adjacent, such
    as when Facebook purchased the rival social media platform Instagram. And it should
    include control of businesses that are vertically adjacent, such as Google’s takeover
    of the ad tech firm DoubleClick or its big acquisitions of companies engaged in
    cloud computing and artificial intelligence, which radically amplify its monopoly
    power.

  zh: 这些原则之一是信息供应链不同层级之间的严格结构分离。因此，执法者应利用传统的反垄断法保持所有基础设施所有者，包括谷歌、亚马逊、Facebook和其他数字平台，远离相邻的业务线。这应包括对水平相邻业务的控制，例如Facebook收购竞争对手社交媒体平台Instagram时的情况。它还应包括对垂直相邻业务的控制，例如谷歌收购广告技术公司DoubleClick或其在云计算和人工智能领域的大规模收购，这些收购大大增强了其垄断力量。
- en: Fortunately, enforcers in the United States and around much of the world are
    already taking important first steps along these lines. As previously mentioned,
    the Justice Department is suing Google to break up its control of digital ad tech
    exchanges. It is also pursuing another suit, likely to be decided soon, that charges
    Google with unlawfully maintaining monopolies through anticompetitive and exclusionary
    practices in the search advertising market. Though not always successful, under
    Biden, antitrust enforcers are winning many tough cases, not least because they
    are asking for a return to the original intent of antitrust law—a position that
    resonates with many conservative jurists committed to “strict construction.” (See
    “[Winning the Anti-Monopoly Game](https://washingtonmonthly.com/2023/10/29/winning-the-anti-monopoly-game/),”
    in the November/December 2023 issue of this magazine.) Similar antitrust suits
    against the platform monopolies have also been filed by the European Commission,
    the UK’s Competition and Markets Authority, and regulators in Germany, Korea,
    India, and elsewhere.

  zh: 幸运的是，美国及世界许多地方的执法者已经朝着这些方向迈出了重要的第一步。正如之前提到的，司法部正在起诉谷歌，要求分拆其对数字广告技术交易的控制权。同时，它还在追求另一项诉讼，可能很快就会做出决定，指控谷歌在搜索广告市场通过反竞争和排斥性做法非法维持垄断地位。尽管并非总是成功，在拜登的领导下，反垄断执法者正在赢得许多艰难的案件，至少因为他们要求回归反垄断法最初的意图——这一立场得到了许多坚持“严格解释”的保守派法官的认同。（见本杂志2023年11月/12月期的“[赢得反垄断游戏](https://washingtonmonthly.com/2023/10/29/winning-the-anti-monopoly-game/)”文章。）欧洲委员会、英国竞争与市场管理局以及德国、韩国、印度等地的监管机构也对平台垄断进行了类似的反垄断诉讼。
- en: Law enforcers should also make clear that the unprecedented combination of powers
    and privileges created by Section 230 applies only to small chat rooms and bulletin
    boards, not to providers of essential communications infrastructure. The simplest
    and most straightforward way to move toward these goals would be for the FTC,
    the FCC, or both to assert their full authority to regulate the terms of service
    and pricing behaviors of platform monopolists. This is essentially what the FCC
    did in 2015 with the Open Internet Order, which enforced net neutrality on internet
    service providers, but in that case it applied the principle to physical, as opposed
    to virtual, infrastructure. Furthermore, the FTC could stop many of the abuses
    in digital advertising markets, including those regarding users’ personal privacy,
    just by evoking its broad authority, under Section 5 of its enabling legislation,
    to restrict unfair methods of competition.

  zh: 执法者还应明确指出，根据第230条所创造的前所未有的权力和特权组合，仅适用于小型聊天室和公告板，而不适用于提供基本通信基础设施的供应商。朝着这些目标迈进的最简单和最直接的方式是，FTC、FCC或两者都行，均应行使其完全的管理权，以规范平台垄断者的服务条款和定价行为。这基本上是FCC在2015年《开放互联网命令》中所做的事情，该命令强制对互联网服务提供商实行网络中立性，但在那种情况下，它将原则应用于物理基础设施，而非虚拟基础设施。此外，FTC可以通过援引其授权法案第5条下广泛的管理权，限制不公平竞争方式，阻止数字广告市场中的许多滥用行为，包括涉及用户个人隐私的行为。
- en: None of these policies taken by themselves is sufficient to fix our broken information
    environment. But in combination, they can significantly address the central threats
    to freedom of speech and of the press. To ensure that policy makers have the political
    cover they need to take on today’s unprecedented concentrations of corporate power
    over what we can say and hear, journalists have to understand, and help the public
    to understand, what the real stakes are.

  zh: 以上这些政策单独来看都不足以修复我们破碎的信息环境。但是结合起来，它们可以显著应对言论自由和新闻自由面临的核心威胁。为了确保决策者能够在今天前所未有的企业权力集中面前采取行动，以便我们能够说和听到什么，记者们必须理解并帮助公众理解真正的利害关系。
