  zh: 但比培养肉类“反肉类”声誉更为有争议的或许是它在气候变化斗争中的地位。培养肉类是否比传统肉类的碳排放更低取决于多种因素，比如用于供电的能源类型以及替代的肉类类型。一项研究甚至表明，培养肉类可能比传统肉类对气候影响更糟糕[25倍](https://www.newscientist.com/article/2372229-lab-grown-meat-could-be-25-times-worse-for-the-climate-than-beef/)。（像SciFi
    Foods这样的公司声称，他们的产品比传统培养肉类更可持续，使用了他们个人委托的研究。）德桑蒂斯州长似乎是在传达这种思维方式，即农业正受到不公平的妖魔化——见[永无休止的对牛打嗝战争](https://www.reuters.com/breakingviews/war-cow-farts-is-stinky-necessary-job-2023-03-24/)——同时支持禁止培养肉类。

    attacking [ESG governance](https://www.thefp.com/p/the-giant-grift-that-swallowed-wall),
    a set of standards companies can adhere to if they wish to market themselves to
    socially conscious investors. “They want to blame agriculture for global warming.”

  zh: “他们真的想针对农业，”他在最近的演讲中说道，攻击[ESG治理](https://www.thefp.com/p/the-giant-grift-that-swallowed-wall)，这是一套公司可以遵循的标准，如果它们希望向社会意识投资者推销自己的话。“他们想要把全球变暖的责任归咎于农业。”
- en: Everyone knows that ESG is a moral laundering scheme for socially liberal neurotics
    with too much money (Marathon Petroleum is an “ESG” company), but the fact is
    that’s more of a goofy marketing racket rather than a burger-snatching New World
    Order. But that doesn’t matter—perception does, and the perception is that cultivated
    meat is part of an effort to replace traditional meat with Frankenfood at the
    behest of godless, sanctimonious elites who obsess over climate change because
    they, unlike regular Americans, don’t have any real problems. I think that this
    was the real driving force behind Florida’s meat ban, with the health concerns
    serving as a good talking point, and the beef lobby’s political patronage merely
    serving as the icing on a cake everyone already wanted to bake.

  zh: 每个人都知道ESG是一种道德洗钱方案，是给有太多钱的社会自由神经质人士用的（马拉松石油是一个“ESG”公司），但事实上更像是一个傻乎乎的营销骗局，而不是汉堡抢夺新世界秩序。但这并不重要——重要的是感知，而感知是培养肉类是为了代替传统肉类而生产的弗兰肯食品的一部分，这是在无神论、自以为是的精英们的主导下，他们过于关注气候变化是因为他们与普通美国人不同，没有任何真正的问题。我认为这才是佛罗里达州禁止肉类的真正推动力，健康问题只是一个很好的谈资，而牛肉游说团体的政治赞助只是一场所有人都想要发起的蛋糕上的糖衣。
- en: March told me he thought the FDA was the best arbiter of safety and that consumers
    should be the ones to ultimately decide whether or not they want to eat cultivated
    meat—not their state government. It’s a clear answer, which is more than I received
    from proponents of the Florida ban.

  zh: March 告诉我，他认为FDA是最好的安全仲裁者，消费者应该最终决定是否要食用培育肉。这是一个明确的答案，比我从佛罗里达禁令的支持者那里得到的要多。
- en: Lawmakers opposed to cultivated meat can’t seem to decide who should make the
    call on safety, when there might be “enough” research, or why, given the wide
    array of “unnatural” food products lining Publix shelves today, individual Floridians
    shouldn’t be able to decide for themselves whether they want to eat the product.
    As a Floridian who wrote this article with a cigarette in his mouth, I don’t want
    my state government prohibiting products where the detrimental health effects
    are certain, much less theoretical.

  zh: 反对培育肉的立法者似乎无法决定谁应该对安全做出决定，在可能有“足够”的研究时，或者为什么，考虑到如今在普布利克斯货架上林立的各种“非自然”食品，佛罗里达个体不应该自己决定是否要食用该产品。作为在写这篇文章时嘴里叼着香烟的佛罗里达人，我不希望我的州政府禁止那些健康有害效果是确定的产品，更不用说那些理论上的了。
