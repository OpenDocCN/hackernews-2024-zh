    “get to know themselves” before committing to another relationship. They need
    to “learn responsibility” before being given responsibility. Hell, even job descriptions
    fall prey to this misguided logic; they often want applicants to have done all

  zh: 如果存在主义焦虑是在思考你的生活目标是什么，那么有一个要求你所有时间、精力和资源的孩子，并让你成为一个生理上不同的人，可以很好地解决这个问题，从实际和心理上来说。对于父母来说，以前重要的事情现在不那么重要了。父母们经常谈论这种观念的变化——即使你试图制止他们——对工作态度的改变只是其中一个例子。
- en: From the evolutionary point of view, this makes sense. The role of many of our
    modules is to bring us to the point of reproduction. Once those modules have done
    their job, and new modules are up and running, it makes sense that priorities
    (and thus behavior) would change. Parents are in a different life stage with different
    evolutionary goals.

  zh: 从进化的角度来看，这是有道理的。我们许多模块的作用是将我们带到繁殖的时刻。一旦这些模块完成了它们的工作，并且新的模块已经运行起来，优先事项（及行为）改变是有道理的。父母处于不同的生活阶段，有不同的进化目标。
- en: To really drive home this point, consider sea squirts. At the start of their
    [life cycle](https://www.science.org/content/article/half-billion-year-old-sea-squirt-could-push-back-origins-vertebrates-including-humans),
    they are mobile. They search for a place to anchor, where they grow and then reproduce.
    Since they no longer need nervous tissue once they anchor—they are sessile—they
    digest their brain tissue. No, I’m not suggesting parents are brainless, but I
    am saying that evolution gives rise to systems that are specific to life-history
    phase.

  zh: 要真正强调这一点，可以考虑海鞘。它们的 [生命周期](https://www.science.org/content/article/half-billion-year-old-sea-squirt-could-push-back-origins-vertebrates-including-humans)
    起初是移动的。它们寻找一个固定的地方来依附，生长，然后繁殖。一旦它们依附，就不再需要神经组织——它们是固着的——它们消化它们的脑组织。不，我并不是在暗示父母是没有大脑的，但我确实说进化造就了适合生命周期阶段的系统。
- en: Of course, people can get existential answers through means other than kids.
    The nice thing about getting older in general is that we begin garnering more
    respect in our communities, careers, and families. We start taking on more responsibility
    and transition from receiving help and guidance to providing it. There is also
    some path dependence to older age; our options are cut short by the limited time
    we have left. In short, usually no matter what happens, we graduate from asking
    what it’s all about. We’re just past that stage of life.

  zh: 当然，人们可以通过其他方式获得存在的答案，而不仅仅是通过孩子。总的来说，随着年龄的增长，我们在社区、职业和家庭中开始获得更多的尊重。我们开始承担更多的责任，从接受帮助和指导转变为提供帮助和指导。老年时期也有某种路径依赖性；我们的选择受限于我们所剩的有限时间。简而言之，通常无论发生什么，我们都毕业于探索生命意义的阶段。我们已经过了那个阶段。
