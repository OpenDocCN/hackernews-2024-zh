    email on her phone. After 55 years, [Small Press Distribution](https://spdbooks.org/)
    (SPD)—one of the last remaining independent book distributors in the US—was shutting
    down immediately, with no advance notice or transitional support. Its website
    went dark, its Twitter account was deleted, and no one was answering calls.

    Press Distribution](https://spdbooks.org/)（SPD）突然宣布关闭，没有提前通知或过渡支持。其网站关闭，Twitter账号被删除，电话也无人接听。

    She’s the executive editor of [Black Lawrence Press](https://blacklawrencepress.com/),
    one of more than 400 publishers that relied on SPD to fulfill online orders and
    make copies available to bookstores and libraries. “A lot of people are really
    angry,” Goettel says. “I’m a little angry myself, but mostly I’m sad about the
    loss of this organization, and afraid of what it means.”

    Arizona Poetry Center in Tucson when she received a text about SPD. “We were shocked,
    [though] some of the fulfillment issues we encountered over the past few months
    began to make more sense,” Gzemski says. “We’re already working on shoestring

- en: Distributors are perhaps the most opaque and byzantine part of the publishing
    industry. When you buy a book on Amazon or Bookshop.org, it’s usually the distributor—not
    the publisher—who ships you a copy from its warehouse. When bookstores, libraries,
    and schools order books for their brick-and-mortar locations, they use online
    catalogs populated by distributors. Even further, most distributors (including
    SPD, before it vanished) employ sales teams that work to get copies in Barnes
    & Noble, independent bookstores, and other retail outlets like gift shops.

  zh: 分销商可能是出版行业最不透明和最复杂的部分。当你在Amazon或Bookshop.org上购买一本书时，通常是分销商而不是出版商从其仓库寄出一本给你。当书店、图书馆和学校为他们的实体店购买书籍时，他们使用由分销商提供的在线目录。更进一步地，大多数分销商（包括SPD在消失前）都有销售团队，致力于在巴诺书店、独立书店和礼品店等零售店铺中销售书籍。

    of the [Hub City Writers Project](https://www.hubcity.org/) in Spartanburg, SC.

    West, a once-independent distributor that was acquired by Ingram in 2016\. Based
    just outside of Nashville, Ingram is the largest book wholesaler and distributor
    in the US, with more than 17 million titles available (Ingram is a sponsor of
    Literary Hub). In its email to publishers last week, SPD said all of its 300,000
    books had been transferred to either Ingram or Publishers Storage and Shipping

    Hub的赞助商）。在上周给出版商的电子邮件中，SPD表示他们的所有30万本书籍已经转移到Ingram或Publishers Storage and Shipping

    Gannon, executive director of the [Community of Literary Magazines & Presses](https://www.clmp.org/)
    (CLMP), many members of which were distributed by SPD. “Having to submit claims
    and figure out what may or may not be owed puts a significant burden on these
    small operations, especially when we’ve heard from some presses that they no longer
    have access to sales reports,” Gannon says. “Additionally, any presses that want

    didn’t receive a response before publication. Gannon, Gzemski, and Goettel have

- en: On the CLMP’s emergency Zoom, some presses were bullish on Asterism thanks to
    its low costs. But unlike Bookmobile and most other distributors, Asterism doesn’t

- en: “Our returns policy has raised a few eyebrows, but I wouldn’t say we’ve met
    fierce resistance over it,” Rothes says. “We compromised with bookstores on event
    orders, [more] than 200 bookstores have signed up for accounts with Asterism so
    far, and it seems booksellers are generally happy to order fewer copies of more
    titles, and re-order when they need to.”

- en: Asterism also doesn’t currently distribute to Amazon, a major source of income
    for many small presses who see it as a necessary evil. “We don’t sell into marketplaces
    that routinely discount titles below what booksellers can sell them for,” Rothes
    says, “but we’re not exclusive and don’t demand control over all of our publishers’
    sales channels. Publishers can and do manage their own Amazon seller accounts,
    or take advantage of the integration options through print-on-demand services.”

  zh: Asterism目前也不向亚马逊进行分销，而亚马逊对许多小出版社来说是一项重要的收入来源，他们将其视为必要之恶。“我们不向市场常规折扣低于书店销售价格的平台销售书籍，”Rothes说。“但我们并非独占，也不要求控制我们所有出版商的销售渠道。出版商可以并且确实管理自己的亚马逊销售账户，或利用印刷需求服务的集成选项。”
- en: 'Still, Rothes says Asterism will continue listening to what small presses need:
    “We’ll absolutely maintain a dialogue with both booksellers and publishers, old
    and new, to determine when we might need to compromise or change course.”'

    could be prohibitively expensive, and Bookmobile or Asterism, which might be more
    affordable. “If they have the bandwidth, these presses can also sell their books
    directly to consumers, but the problem is discoverability,” Gannon says, echoing
    Meg Reid. “This is a devastating and sudden turn of events, [but those presses
