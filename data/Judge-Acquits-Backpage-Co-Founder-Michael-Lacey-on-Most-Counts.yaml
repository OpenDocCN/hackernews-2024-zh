    Lacey数十项指控无罪，包括联邦检察官计划今年晚些时候对Lacey重新审判的大部分指控。美国地区法官Diane Humetewa还对前Backpage高管Jed

    facilitated prostitution or participated in a conspiracy to facilitate prostitution
    via the online classifieds site he founded with his longtime newspaper partner
    James Larkin. (Larkin [took his own life last summer](https://reason.com/2023/08/02/backpage-publisher-alt-weekly-entrepreneur-and-free-speech-warrior-james-larkin-has-died/)

    Larkin创立的在线分类广告网站促进卖淫的指控。（Larkin在去年夏天的审判前几天[自杀身亡](https://reason.com/2023/08/02/backpage-publisher-alt-weekly-entrepreneur-and-free-speech-warrior-james-larkin-has-died/)。）

    Additionally, Humetewa acquitted Spear, former executive vice president of Backpage,

    concealment of money laundering—on which the jury found him guilty. It comes with
    a possible sentence of up to 20 years in federal prison. Lacey plans to appeal
    his conviction on this count, and there seems like a good chance it will be successful,
    since the money he allegedly "concealed" was reported to the federal government
    with all the proper paperwork. But he could still face prison time as that appeals
    process plays out.

  zh: 而在6月17日，Lacey将因为陪审团认定他有罪的一项指控——国际洗钱隐瞒罪——而被判刑。这可能导致他在联邦监狱里被判最长20年的刑期。Lacey计划就这一项定罪上诉，看起来他成功的机会很大，因为他所谓的“隐瞒”的钱款已经按照所有规定向联邦政府报告。但在上诉过程中，他仍可能面临监禁。
- en: Brunst is scheduled to be sentenced along with Lacey in June and even with Humetewa's
    acquittals, he still faces sentencing on 14 counts. And Spear, who is scheduled
    to be sentenced on July 9, still faces sentencing on 29 counts.
