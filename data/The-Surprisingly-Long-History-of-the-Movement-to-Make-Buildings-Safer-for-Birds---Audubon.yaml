    helped me picture my lower Manhattan route as it existed centuries ago: a thick
    stand of hickory and chestnut trees amid a rich mix of waterways, wetlands, and
    upland habitats. Birds stopped to rest and refuel on their migratory journeys,
    which they navigated with the help of the planet’s magnetic field, as well as
    the moon, stars, and landscape features illuminated in the otherwise pitch-dark
    night. It’s just bad luck for birds that cities tend to develop in biodiversity
    havens. “The same things that make a landmass or an area good for people are also
    usually good for birds,” Partridge says. “These long-term routes are ingrained

    piecemeal actions to a far larger scale. Scientists understand more than ever
    about what causes the greatest lethal risk. For example, while skyscrapers have
    historically received the most attention and may harm more birds per building,
    data make it clear that glass on lower levels and on lower-rise buildings and
    homes—especially when it reflects vegetation—takes a greater overall toll.

- en: Today, New York City leads the nation in bird-friendly legislation. In 2019,
    a coalition of advocates won one of the country’s strongest ordinances, which
    requires that new and significantly renovated buildings use materials that reduce
    collision risk. “Beyond saving birds in New York City, Local Law 15 inspired similar
    requirements across the country and helped expand the market for bird-friendly
    glass, lowering prices and making it more accessible,” Wilson says. A pair of
    bills enacted in 2022 require city-owned and -managed buildings to turn off nonessential
    outdoor lights during migration and use motion sensors to minimize lights inside.
    A groundbreaking proposal to apply similar rules to privately owned commercial
    buildings [was introduced](https://nyc.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=6203111&GUID=D371C0A1-CBB9-401D-B547-429757E2E0E1)
    by a city council member in 2023.

    of policies, while advocates are pushing for stronger actions at all levels, including
    [in New York State](https://www.nysenate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2024/brad-hoylman-sigal/legislators-advocates-rename-statewide-bird-safe)
    and [in Congress](https://act.audubon.org/a/bird-safe-buildings-act-2023). From

- en: n a landmark 2019 study, scientists estimated that North America had lost 3
    billion birds since 1970—a nearly 30 percent decline. For many of us dedicated
    to picking up broken birds from sidewalks, those losses are ever-present and dispiriting.
    Over seven monitoring seasons since 2020, I’ve documented nearly 1,800 window-struck
    birds on what I call my “sad birding” roster of nearly 80 species, including many
    considered vulnerable and near-threatened. When I think of warblers still hitting
    windows that Creshkoff patrolled decades ago, I want to retire my collision backpack
    and move to the woods.

    that it’s important to persevere. Window collisions are a severe issue and contribute
    to the loss of avian populations across North America, Partridge points out. “But
    I’m optimistic,” he says, “because it is something that we can relatively easily
    fix.”

    link in a long chain going back more than 135 years. Through the efforts of many,
    the deadliest structures are being made safer. And in recent decades we’ve become
    even more organized in a growing grassroots movement.

    awareness beyond dedicated bird advocates, planting seeds for further change.
    After my publicity in 2021, not only was I recognized by a stranger as “the dead
    bird lady from Twitter”—the perfect epitaph!—but it’s also not unusual for downtown
    residents walking kids to school to wave me down and hand over an injured bird
    or for community members and building workers to lament to us volunteers about
    dead birds they see.

- en: Making large-scale progress may be a long game, and getting everybody on board
    is unfortunately complicated, but the idea of saving hundreds of thousands of
    birds a year in New York alone makes the tough parts worthwhile. While Manhattan
    will never revert to forest and wetlands, I know we can at least be better hosts
    to birds as they travel through, heeding the call of migration for millennia to
    come.
