    few completely new major commercial airports were constructed." Of the 50 largest

    noise problem. The first generation of jet airliners used turbojet engines, in
    which air enters the engine, gets compressed, burned, and is exhausted out at
    supersonic speed. It was this supersonic exhaust which created the lion’s share
    of jet engine noise. But in the late 1950s, a new type of jet engine was developed,
    the turbofan. Unlike the turbojet (where all the air enters the combustion chamber
    and is burned) a turbofan has a large fan mounted to the front that pulls air
    into the engine but around the combustion chamber (because this air bypasses the
    combustion chamber, turbofans are also called bypass engines). The turbofan extracted
    much more energy from the hot exhaust of the combustion chamber, leading to a
    colder exhaust stream. Not only was this more fuel efficient (jet engines are
    most efficient when the speed of their exhaust matches the cruising speed of the
    aircraft), but they were much quieter than turbojets. By 1961, turbofans had replaced
    turbojets on all new commercial jets.

    compensation (dating from a 1946 case in which low-flying military jets caused
    a farmer's chickens to kill themselves as they ran into the walls in fright).
    And they had also established that airport owners were responsible for the noise
    that they generated. But even as the courts assigned responsibility for noise
    to airports, they greatly restricted what airports could do about it. Airport
    rules that limited night takeoffs and landings, for instance, were often overturned,
    with courts ruling that air traffic fell under the jurisdiction of the FAA. Zoning
    rules near airports that might limit noise exposure were also often struck down
    as not beneficial to the general public. And though airports lobbied for a federal
    noise abatement policy (in part to reduce their own liability), the government

    in the world on 650 acres of space), a modern airport needs thousands of acres.
    Runways are two miles or more in length, and require thousands of feet of space
    between them to allow simultaneous landing of planes. This, along with the additional
    land needed to be acquired as a noise buffer, means that airports are “the largest
    land using facilities on the urban periphery,” often the size of a city in their

    as the city of Dallas did, and Denver International Airport is [as large](https://www.reddit.com/r/aviation/comments/7xkefe/the_actual_size_of_denver_international_airport/)

    valuable areas such as forests or wetlands, damaging them even if they’re just
    used for a noise buffer (the risk of bird strikes means that the ideal airport

  zh: 然而，空中旅行系统似乎不断地遭遇其容量限制，尤其是像纽约这样交通繁忙且扩展能力有限的地方。全国各地曾经出现过严重的航班延误，分别是在60年代末期、1980年代末期和1990年代末期。实际上，空中客车公司开发巨型A380飞机的依据是有限的机场容量意味着航空公司别无选择，只能使用更少但更大的飞机（事实上，这并没有发生，航空公司选择购买数千架像737
    MAX这样的较小飞机，显然是成功的，这点我并不完全理解）。
- en: Air travel is an interesting dichotomy. On the one hand, building the infrastructure
    for it is unbelievably difficult. Airports are incredibly hard to build, aircraft
    are incredibly hard to make a profit selling, airlines are frequently going bankrupt.
    And yet this hasn’t stopped air travel from steadily becoming cheaper, safer,
    more convenient and more ubiquitous. The pre-jet era, when aircraft and airports
    could be developed without spending billions of dollars, was also the era where
    air travel was noisy, inconvenient, and reserved for a relatively small number
    of people. It was somehow brought to the masses, transformed from a miracle to
    a modern convenience even as every aspect of it steadily got closer and closer
    to being impossible to achieve.

  zh: 航空旅行是一个有趣的二元性。一方面，建设航空基础设施是极其困难的。机场建设异常艰难，飞机很难盈利销售，航空公司经常破产。然而，这并没有阻止航空旅行逐步变得更加便宜、更加安全、更加便捷和更加普及化。在喷气机时代之前，飞机和机场可以在不花费数十亿美元的情况下开发，但那个时代的航空旅行嘈杂、不便，并且仅供相对少数的人使用。即使在各个方面逐渐接近不可能实现的情况下，航空旅行也被带到了大众面前，从奇迹转变为现代便利。
