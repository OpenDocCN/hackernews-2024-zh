- en: There's something I once read in an article which I can't find any more. It
    was something by a really young CEO of some unicorn startup type company, and
    it said things that people really did not like. It was the sort of thing that
    you should never say about other people. Actually, more to the point, it was the
    sort of thing you should never *think* about other people, but this person obviously
    failed at both. People gasped at the audacity of talking about it and kind of
    missed the fact that ... yes, people DO think that way. Even now.

  zh: 有一件事我曾经在一篇文章中读到过，但现在找不到了。它是一位某种独角兽初创公司的非常年轻CEO所说的东西，而且是一些人真的不喜欢的东西。这是你不应该对别人说的事情。事实上，更重要的是，这是你不应该*想*对别人说的事情，但这个人显然两者都做错了。人们对于他们谈论的大胆感到惊讶，并且有点忽略了这个事实……是的，人们现在仍然这样想。

  zh: 第一种可能性是，这个人很厉害。他们是那些已经赚到了财富并且只是因为喜欢才待在工作岗位上的人。他们没有必要呆在那里。
- en: The other possibility is that the person is the exact opposite of a badass,
    and has managed to not cash out despite being in the biz for a very long time.
    They've made no money, may be living paycheck to paycheck, and really need the
    job. Basically, the fact they're not "at the top" despite their age means they
    are crap.

  zh: 另一个可能性是，这个人完全不是一个厉害角色的相反，并且尽管在这个行业很长时间了，但还没有退出。他们没有赚到钱，可能是靠发薪水度日，并且真的需要这份工作。基本上，尽管年纪大了，他们并不处于“顶端”，这意味着他们很糟糕。

- en: In those five words, the manager managed to say so many things. First, the worker
    is deemed "old". Then, following from that, why can't they afford to quit? Why
    haven't they gone off to sail the world? What is their major malfunction which
    makes them unable to hit the jackpot? With all of the years they have put into
    this career of theirs, how have they managed to suck?

  zh: 在这五个词中，经理成功地表达了很多事情。首先，工人被认为是“老的”。然后，由此引申出来的问题是，为什么他们负担不起辞职？为什么他们没去环游世界？他们哪里出了大问题，让他们无法一夜暴富？尽管他们在这个职业中度过了这么多年，他们是怎么搞砸的？
- en: 'Let me be clear: this was not an extract from a longer sentence between two
    friends, like "Since you have all that cash, why are you still working". It was
    a straightforward antagonistic question by a manager who''s too stupid to know
    that such things make the company lawyers nervous because discrimination lawsuits
    have been started over less.'

  zh: 让我明确一点：这不是两位朋友之间的长句摘录，像是“既然你有那么多现金，为什么还在工作”。这是一个直接的对抗性问题，由一个太蠢的经理提出的，他不知道这样的话会让公司的律师感到紧张，因为歧视诉讼的起因往往更微不足道。
