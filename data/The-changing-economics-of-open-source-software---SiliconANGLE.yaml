- en: But unlike earlier changes brought about by corporate acquisitions, this time
    it’s thanks to the growing series of tech layoffs. These could lead to many projects
    being crippled because their principals are now unemployed or will get new jobs
    in less open-favorable companies. The layoffs will certainly change the balance
    of power between large and small software vendors, and between free and commercial
    software versions, and the role played by OSS in enterprise software applications
    could change.

  zh: 但与以前由企业收购带来的变化不同，这一次要归功于不断增多的科技裁员。这可能导致许多项目陷入困境，因为它们的主要人物现在失业了，或者将在不太支持开放的公司找到新工作。裁员肯定会改变大型和小型软件供应商之间的权力平衡，以及免费和商业软件版本之间的角色，开源软件在企业软件应用程序中的作用也可能会改变。
- en: Most analysts agree that open source has become firmly planted into commercial
    software development, both from the perspective of the vendors who contribute
    their code back to the world as well as for those end-users who develop applications
    built around open-source projects.

  zh: 大多数分析人士都同意，开源已经牢牢地融入了商业软件开发中，无论是从贡献自己代码给世界的供应商的角度，还是从开发围绕开源项目构建应用程序的最终用户的角度。
- en: This position has further solidified thanks to the major boost from generative
    artificial intelligence. That’s because of numerous AI-related projects that grew
    exponentially in the past year as developers rushed to implement its routines
    into their code. AI has brought hundreds of developers into the OSS fold because
    so much of its code uses various OSS projects, such as PyTorch which began under
    Meta Platforms Inc. and became its own OSS juggernaut with more than 600,000 code
    repositories.

  zh: 由于生成式人工智能的主要推动作用，这一立场得到了进一步巩固。这是因为过去一年间许多与人工智能相关的项目呈指数级增长，开发人员纷纷将其例程实施到其代码中。人工智能已经将数百名开发人员引入了开源软件（OSS）的行列，因为其大部分代码使用了各种OSS项目，比如PyTorch，它最初是在Meta
    Platforms Inc.旗下开发的，后来成为了自己的OSS巨头，拥有超过60万个代码库。

    to Oracle acquiring Sun Microsystems for $7.4 billion. At the time there was much
    pearl-clutching about the anticompetitive underpinnings, with the European approval
    held up. Thousands of Sun employees were terminated along the way.

- en: At the time, Sun was home to several significant OSS projects, since it was
    the home to the principals behind Java, XML, JRuby and other tools. (They all
    eventually left Oracle, along with Sun’s chief executive, who was one of the first

    which operates a multimillion-dollar, multimodal organization that is focused
    on open-source support. There are close to 1,000 different software projects under
    its umbrella. It depends on hundreds of company members that make annual contributions,

- en: But money is only one point of view. The foundation has had a rocky year itself,
    laying off numerous employees. Part of that was in anticipation of reduced support
    from the tech companies that shed staff, many of which were high-level foundation
    supporters. For example, VMware, a platinum member, has pulled its support entirely,
    along with several other gold-level sponsors.

- en: “This was a shock to the system,” Linux Foundation Senior Vice President Mike
    Dolan told SiliconANGLE. “We have had to make some adjustments because so many
    open-systems engineers were let go.” Dolan said there are more than 80 funding
    initiatives that operate independently under the foundation’s umbrella, such as
    the Cloud Native Computing Foundation, the PyTorch Foundation, the Hyperledger
    Foundation and the Overture Maps Foundation.

    Native Computing Foundation、PyTorch Foundation、Hyperledger Foundation和Overture
    Maps Foundation。
- en: “The problem now is that especially in the operating system and financial services
    markets, there is a large uptake in consumption of open-source code, but the contributions
    back to the community and commitments to fixing code is lacking,” said Jason Perlow,
    a longtime OSS advocate who was one of those laid off this month at the foundation.
    He told SiliconANGLE that what is missing is what’s called an “open source program
    office, which is used to cultivate and track an organization’s OSS code and coordinate
    changes.”

    Perlow在本月被该基金会解雇之一后说道。他告诉SiliconANGLE，缺少的是所谓的“开源项目办公室”，这个办公室用于培育和跟踪组织的OSS代码并协调变更。
- en: Red Hat, long a poster child for OSS, has lately seen a reduced effort with
    contributing its code, according to Perlow. Much of this could be caused by funding
    pressures to operate these offices, especially as the software industry shrinks.

- en: But it isn’t all singing kumbaya around the campfire. In 2023, there were two
    other events that shook the OSS foundational tenets, both involving conflicts
    over licensing. Meta released the latest version of its Llama large language model
    as OSS, as long as it wasn’t heavily used by an enterprise, in which case [companies
    would have to pay a fee to license its use.](https://opensourceconnections.com/blog/2023/07/19/is-llama-2-open-source-no-and-perhaps-we-need-a-new-definition-of-open/)
