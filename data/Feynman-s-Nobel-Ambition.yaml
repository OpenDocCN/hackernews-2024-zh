    to *enjoy* doing physics. Why did I enjoy it? I used to *play* with it. I used
    to do whatever I felt like doing - it didn''t have to do with whether it was important
    for the development of nuclear physics, but whether it was interesting and amusing
    for me to play with. When I was in high school, I''d see water running out of
    a faucet growing narrower, and wonder if I could figure out what determines that
    curve. I found it was rather easy to do. I didn''t *have* to do it; it wasn''t
    important for the future of science; somebody else had already done it. That didn''t
    make any difference. I''d invent things and play with things for my own entertainment.'

  zh: 然后我又想了一想：现在物理有点让我恶心，但我过去*喜欢*做物理。我为什么喜欢呢？我过去喜欢*玩*物理。我过去做任何我想做的事情 - 它与我是否对核物理的发展重要无关，而是与我是否对玩耍感兴趣和愉快无关。当我上高中时，我看到水从水龙头流出变窄，想知道是什么决定了那个曲线。我发现这很容易做到。我不*需要*这样做；这对科学的未来不重要；其他人已经做过了。这都无关紧要。我会发明东西，玩弄东西，只是为了自己的娱乐。

    anything, I've got this nice position at the university teaching classes which
    I rather enjoy, and just like I read the Arabian Nights for pleasure, I'm going
    to *play* with physics, whenever I want to, without worrying about any importance
    whatsoever.

- en: Within a week I was in the cafeteria and some guy, fooling around, throws a
    plate in the air. As the plate went up in the air I saw it wobble, and I noticed
    the red medallion of Cornell on the plate going around. It was pretty obvious
    to me that the medallion went around faster than the wobbling.

  zh: 一周之内，我在自助餐厅，有个家伙在闲逛，把一个盘子扔到了空中。盘子飞起来的时候，我看到它摇晃，我注意到康奈尔的红色徽章在盘子上转动。对我来说很明显，徽章转得比摇晃快得多。
- en: 'I had nothing to do, so I start to figure out the motion of the rotating plate.
    I discover that when the angle is very slight, the medallion rotates twice as
    fast as the wobble rate - two to one [Note: Feynman mis-remembers here---the factor
    of 2 is the other way]. It came out of a complicated equation! Then I thought,
    ``Is there some way I can see in a more fundamental way, by looking at the forces
    or the dynamics, why it''s two to one?'''''

  zh: 我无事可做，所以我开始算旋转盘的运动。我发现当角度非常小的时候，徽章的转速是摇晃速率的两倍 - 两对一[注：这里费曼记错了---2倍是另一种方式]。这是一个复杂的方程！然后我想，``有没有一种更基本的方式，通过观察力或动力学，可以看到为什么是两对一呢？''
