    EVs don't work as a replacement for gas cars. Niedermeyer said that while an electric

    prices. Unlike with gas cars, the more you pay for an EV, the more range you can

    in stubbornly high prices. In September, Cox Automotive pegged the average EV
    price at $50,683, down 22% from the same time last year. But an analysis from
    CarGurus found that EV prices were still 28% higher than gas-vehicle prices on

    Automotive将电动车平均价格定为50,683美元，比去年同期下降了22%。但CarGurus的分析发现，电动车的价格平均仍比汽油车高出28%。随着房租、食品杂货和其他商品的价格上涨，普通人用于购买昂贵电动车的现金越来越少。
