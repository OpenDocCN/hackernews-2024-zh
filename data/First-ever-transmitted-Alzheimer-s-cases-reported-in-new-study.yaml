  zh: 伦敦 — 这些阿尔茨海默病病例有些不寻常。

    of the condition. But it was also that the patients were in their 40s and 50s,
    even their 30s, far younger than people who normally develop the disease. They
    didn’t even have the known genetic mutations that can set people on the course
    for such early-onset Alzheimer’s.'

- en: But this small handful of patients did share a particular history. As children,
    they had received growth hormone taken from the brains of human cadavers, which
    used to be a treatment for a number of conditions that caused short stature. Now,
    decades later, they were showing signs of Alzheimer’s. In the interim, scientists
    had discovered that that type of hormone treatment they got could unwittingly
    transfer bits of protein into recipients’ brains. In some cases, it had induced
    a fatal brain disease called Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, or CJD — a finding that
    led to the banning of the procedure 40 years ago.

  zh: 但是这一小部分患者确实有着相似的经历。作为儿童，他们曾接受过从人类尸体脑部提取的生长激素，这曾是治疗多种导致身材矮小的疾病的一种方法。现在，几十年后，他们开始出现阿尔茨海默病的迹象。在此期间，科学家们发现他们接受的那种激素治疗不经意地将蛋白质片段转移到了受体的大脑中。在一些情况下，这导致了一种致命的脑部疾病，称为克雅氏病，或CJD
    — 这一发现导致了40年前该程序的禁止。

    As the scientific team treating the patients [reported Monday](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-023-02729-2)
    in the journal Nature Medicine, the hormone transplant seeded the beta-amyloid
    protein that’s a hallmark of Alzheimer’s in some recipients’ brains, which, decades
    later, propagated into disease-causing plaques. They are the first known cases
    of transmitted Alzheimer’s disease, likely a scientific anomaly yet a finding
    that adds another wrinkle [to ongoing arguments about what truly causes Alzheimer’s](https://www.statnews.com/2019/06/25/alzheimers-cabal-thwarted-progress-toward-cure/).
