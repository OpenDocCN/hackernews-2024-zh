    with getting to the bottom of a 75-cent accounting discrepancy in the lab’s computer
    network, which was rented out to remote users by the minute. Stoll, 36, investigated
    the source of that minuscule anomaly, pulling on it like a loose thread until
    it led to a shocking culprit: a hacker in the system.'

  zh: '**1986年，克利夫·斯托尔的上司**在劳伦斯·伯克利国家实验室交给他一个任务：查明实验室计算机网络中75美分的会计差错根源，这个网络是按分钟租用给远程用户的。36岁的斯托尔展开调查，追踪这个微小的异常，像拉动一根松动的线索一样，直至揭示出震惊人心的真凶：系统中的一个黑客。'
- en: Stoll then spent the next year of his life following that hacker’s footprints
    across the lab’s network and the nascent internet. In doing so, he revealed a
    vast web of similar intrusions into military and government agencies carried out
    by a group of young German hackers, eventually revealed to have been working in
    the service of the Soviet KGB. The story that Stoll unraveled from that tiny initial
    clue, which he published in late 1989 as a kind of digital detective memoir, *The
    Cuckoo’s Egg*, turned out to be the very first known case of state-sponsored hacking—a
    tale far bigger than he could have ever imagined when he began hunting those three
    quarters missing from his lab’s ledger.

  zh: 随后的一年时间里，斯托尔跟随黑客在实验室网络和初期互联网上留下的足迹。在此过程中，他揭示了一系列类似的入侵行为，涉及军方和政府机构，由一群年轻的德国黑客执行，最终被确认为为苏联KGB服务。斯托尔从这个微小的初始线索中解开的故事，于1989年末出版，被称为数字侦探回忆录的开篇之作《杜鹃的蛋》，竟成为已知的首例国家支持的黑客案件——一个远超他最初想象的故事。
- en: 'Today, that story has taken on a larger life still. As *The Cuckoo’s Egg* hits
    its 30th anniversary, the book has sold more than 1 million copies. And for a
    smaller core of cybersecurity practitioners within that massive readership, it’s
    become a kind of legend: the ur-narrative of a lone hacker hunter, a text that
    has inspired an entire generation of network defenders chasing their own anomalies
    through a vastly larger, infinitely more malicious internet.'

  zh: 今天，这个故事仍然有着更为广阔的生命。《杜鹃的蛋》迎来其30周年纪念，该书销量已突破100万册。在庞大读者群中，一小部分网络安全从业者将其视为传奇：一个孤独的黑客猎手的原始叙事，这本书激励了整整一代的网络防御者，他们穿行于更为广袤、更为恶意的互联网，追寻自己的异常活动。

- en: As for 69-year-old Stoll himself, he talks about the entire series of events
    as if he still can’t believe all the fuss he’s caused. “I thought it was a weird,
    bizarre hiccup I’d stumbled into,” Stoll told me when we first spoke last year,
    after I called the home number he lists on the [very eclectic website for his
    business selling klein bottles](https://www.kleinbottle.com/)—blown-glass oddities
    that, topologically speaking, have only one side, with no inside or outside. “I
    had no idea this would become a multibillion-dollar industry. Or essential to
    running a large business. Or that the CEO of a credit reporting company could
    lose his job because of computer security. Or that thousands of people would have
    careers in the field. Or that national institutions in many countries around the
    world would devote themselves to exploiting security holes in computer networks.”

  zh: 至于现年69岁的斯托尔本人，他谈到这一系列事件时，仿佛仍然难以置信自己所引起的轰动。“我当时以为这只是一个奇怪、离奇的小插曲，”斯托尔去年首次与我交谈时告诉我，当时我拨打了他在[他的生意卖克莱因瓶的非常多样化网站上列出的家庭电话号码](https://www.kleinbottle.com/)——这些是拓扑上只有一个面、没有内外的吹制玻璃怪异物品。“我完全没有想到这会成为一个数十亿美元的行业。或者对经营大企业至关重要。或者一个信用报告公司的CEO会因计算机安全问题而失去工作。或者成千上万人会在这个领域有职业生涯。或者许多国家的国家机构会致力于利用计算机网络的安全漏洞。”
- en: In fact, Stoll is an unlikely legend for his cybersecurity industry admirers.
    On the day I visited Stoll in his Oakland home last month, just a few days after
    the 30th anniversary of *The Cuckoo's Egg*’s publication, he had spent the morning
    watching Mercury transit the Sun with his telescope. Stoll has a PhD in planetary
    astronomy and had intended to make stargazing his career before Lawrence Berkeley
    transferred him—not entirely voluntarily—into the IT department.

  zh: 实际上，斯托尔对于他在网络安全行业中的崇拜者来说是一个不太可能的传奇。我在上个月访问斯托尔位于奥克兰的家时，正好是《布谷鸟蛋》出版30周年的几天后，他整个早晨都在用望远镜观测水星凌日。斯托尔拥有行星天文学博士学位，原本打算将观星作为自己的职业，直到伯克利法rence将他——并非完全自愿——转移到了信息技术部门。

    with one wall covered in printed pictures of inventors, mathematicians, and scientists
    who inspire him: Felix Klein, Alan Turing, Emmy Noether. Then he flips up his
    desk on a hinge to reveal a door in the wall beneath it.'

    his house. Using a remote control and watching several screens that show a feed

    a crate full of beautifully crafted klein bottles wrapped in paper.
