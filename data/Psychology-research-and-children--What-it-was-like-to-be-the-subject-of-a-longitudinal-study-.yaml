    Mount Holyoke College and claimed to have read Betty Friedan’s *The Feminine Mystique*
    while pushing a vacuum cleaner; a woman who might never have had children had
    she been born decades later. For my mother, motherhood was a tax being levied

    unhappy mother and longing for my absent father. In my teens, I experimented with

  zh: 当我阅读像这样的帖子，或者在Instagram上观看一个视频，一个孩子在看到他被截肢的脚部位时哭泣，有人（不清楚是谁）拍摄了这个场景，或者看到“#touchedout”这个标签在TikTok上流行，它被母亲们用来让他们的孩子停止触摸他们，我想到了我作为研究对象的经历。在21世纪，我们都是全球心理实验的研究对象，一个孩子的生活被数字化、下载并在没有他或她的同意的情况下在线传播。我的研究者们是仁慈的、开拓者，他们渴望解决我们为什么会变成现在这个样子的谜团，真正的信徒，他们认为理解他人是他们一生的事业。今天，收集我们数字数据的人是拥有模糊议程和不透明伦理的数十亿富豪，他们的兴趣不在于预测未来行为，而在于通过旨在为我们做出选择的算法来引导它，创始人和CEO们像HBO的《继承者》中的Logan
    Roy一样，将人们视为“经济单位”，以增加利润和股东价值为目的进行操纵。在我们这个勇敢的新世界里，父母把育儿放到数字设备上，技术并不是一个足够好的母亲。
- en: '“An economic order founded on the secret massive-scale extraction of human
    data assumes the destruction of privacy as a nonnegotiable condition of its business
    operations,” Shoshana Zuboff, a Harvard Business School professor emeritus, [asserts](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/12/opinion/facebook-privacy.html)
    in “You Are the Object of a Secret Extraction Operation.” Privacy and data go
    hand in hand. Robbing adults of the right to privacy in the pursuit of surveillance
    capitalism profits is one thing. Robbing children of the right to privacy in the
    pursuit of those same profits is another. In fact, children around the world have
    a right to privacy, regardless of what parents, CEOs, and shareholders believe.
    According to [Article 16](https://archive.crin.org/en/home/rights/convention/articles/article-16-protection-privacy.html)
    of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child: “No child shall be
    subjected to arbitrary or unlawful interference with his or her privacy, family,
    home or correspondence, nor to unlawful attacks on his or her honour and reputation.”
    With time, we may discover that with the loss of privacy, a child loses a piece
    of themself.'

    society. In my case, a psychological experiment saved my life. (Having talked
    to others in my cohort, I know I’m not alone in this regard.) Ultimately, as I
    began to write about my experiences as a research subject, I became my own observer
    effect, the phenomenon by which the act of observation changes that which is being
    observed. And, in doing so, I became the author of the story of my life.
