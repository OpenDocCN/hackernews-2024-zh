    the Protecting Americans From Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act, a

    non-US social media apps as national security threats. If they’re hit with that

    《保护美国免受外国对手控制的应用法案》，这是一项听起来绝对荒谬的法案，允许总统指定非美国社交媒体应用为国家安全威胁。如果它们被贴上这个标签，它们有六个月的时间确保它们与美国对手（如中国或伊朗）没有任何联系。如果它们不遵守，它们将被禁止在应用商店和网络托管服务中提供服务，事实上在美国被切断联系。

    have to sell it or risk having it being banned. A total ban still feels unlikely,

    of the ties that bind Silicon Valley and Washington, DC. For decades, the tech

    of investment to accelerate their growth) as they planted their flags in international

    In short, positioning China as a geopolitical threat has been a boon for the tech
    industry, and any morals they once claimed to have are [out the window](https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/08/27/china-tech-facebook-google/?ref=disconnect.blog)
    as they cash in.

  zh: 美国科技主导的终结
- en: The global spread of the internet and dominance of the US tech industry that
    followed it also coincided with the United States’ several decades of global hegemony.
    After the fall of the Soviet Union, there was no other country that could challenge
    US power and it took full advantage by increasing its economic influence and,
    let’s be honest, launching a ton of unnecessary wars with disastrous consequences
    we’re still living with today. Now, as we transition toward a more multipolar
    world with other countries carving out regional spheres of influence, it’s not
    surprising that the “open” internet — meaning a US-dominated internet — is facing
    serious challenges.

  zh: 全球互联网的普及以及随之而来的美国科技产业的主导地位，也与美国几十年的全球霸权相吻合。苏联解体后，再也没有其他国家能够挑战美国的权力，它充分利用这一优势增强其经济影响力，并且，让我们坦率地说，发动了大量毫无必要的战争，其后果至今仍在我们身边。现在，随着我们向一个多极世界过渡，其他国家正在划分地区影响力范围，不足为奇，“开放”的互联网——即由美国主导的互联网——正面临严峻挑战。

- en: Maybe you’re an American and you think the TikTok ban makes sense. Sure, US
    tech companies can track virtually everything you (and people in many countries
    outside the US) do, will hand that data over to the government, and even sell
    it to a ton of data brokers — but at least they’re US companies. Chinese ones
    shouldn’t be allowed to do the same thing, at least to US residents. That line
    of thinking makes no sense to me, but I can see how people only thinking of their
    own narrow national interests can believe it.

  zh: 或许你是美国人，认为禁止TikTok是有道理的。当然，美国科技公司可以追踪几乎你（以及许多美国以外国家的人）所做的一切，并将这些数据交给政府，甚至出售给大量的数据经纪人
    —— 但至少它们是美国公司。中国公司不应该被允许做同样的事情，至少不能对美国居民这样做。我觉得这种想法毫无道理，但我能理解那些只考虑自己狭隘国家利益的人可能会相信这种想法。
- en: 'But why should a Canadian, a European, a Brazilian, a South Korean, or people
    from any number of other countries outside the United States defend that reality
    or find it in any way acceptable? When previous forms of media like radio, film,
    or television and communications technologies like the telephone rolled out, countries
    often placed rules on foreign ownership and content distribution, but with the
    internet little of that was allowed. Countries were expected to accept US dominance
    of the new medium, yet now we see what happens when those US firms start to face
    real competition at home: the US government does exactly what it long said no
    one else was allowed to do and protects its domestic industry.'

  zh: 但为什么加拿大人、欧洲人、巴西人、韩国人或其他许多国家的人应该捍卫这种现实，或者以任何方式接受它呢？在之前的媒体形式如广播、电影或电视以及像电话这样的通信技术推出时，国家通常会制定对外国所有权和内容分发的规定，但在互联网上几乎没有这样的规定。国家被期望接受美国在新媒介中的主导地位，然而现在我们看到，当这些美国公司开始在国内面临真正的竞争时，美国政府却正是长期所说的任何其他国家都不允许做的事情，即保护其国内产业。
- en: Whatever happens with the TikTok ban, it’s time to reconsider the myths that
    have been built up about the internet and digital technology that were designed
    to serve the interests of US tech companies. China is in the crosshairs today
    because it’s the only country that’s developed a domestic tech industry that can
    really give Silicon Valley a run for its money. Should the rest of the world,
    or even just Western countries, really be expected to accept the dominance of
    Facebook, Amazon, and Google in perpetuity? Instead of defending US tech companies
    from Chinese competition, we must work toward a vision of an internet (and a world)
    that rejects the dominance of either.

  zh: 无论TikTok是否被禁，现在是重新考虑关于互联网和数字技术的神话的时候了，这些神话是为了服务美国科技公司的利益而设计的。中国如今处于瞄准之中，因为它是唯一一个发展出可以真正与硅谷匹敌的国内科技产业的国家。难道全世界，甚至只是西方国家，真的应该接受Facebook、Amazon和Google永久的主导地位吗？我们必须努力实现一个拒绝任何一方主导的互联网（以及世界）的愿景，而不是为了抵抗中国的竞争而捍卫美国科技公司。
