  zh: 使用这个流行网站玻璃门（Glassdoor）的用户们，允许他们匿名注册以评价他们曾经工作过的公司，称玻璃门在未经他们同意的情况下收集并添加了他们的真实姓名到他们的用户资料中。
- en: One user, who goes by Monica, wrote in a post on her personal blog that Glassdoor
    added her name and the city where she lives to her Glassdoor profile following
    an email exchange with Glassdoor customer support, despite having never provided
    her name during the sign-up process some years earlier. Monica, whose last name
    we’re not publishing to protect her privacy, accused Glassdoor of getting her
    full name from the email she sent to customer support, which she says they added
    to her Glassdoor profile.

    did not have her consent or permission to do this. But Glassdoor said Monica was
    “required” to have her name added to her profile, adding that this would not compromise
    her anonymity of past reviews she gave. Monica said that her anonymity might not
    last if Glassdoor was to experience a hack or a data breach and compromise users’
    data. It also means this information can be obtained by legal process, such as
    a lawsuit or police demanding access to Glassdoor user data.

    Monica’s story, explained that Fishbowl requires users to verify their identities
    before using the site. As part of the acquisition deal, Glassdoor signed every
    user up for a Fishbowl account, meaning Glassdoor would have to change its terms
    of service so that every Glassdoor user could also be verified.
