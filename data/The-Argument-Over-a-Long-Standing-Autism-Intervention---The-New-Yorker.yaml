    children teased her for how she spoke: she talked too softly, she talked in a
    monotone, she paused too long between words, she didn’t talk enough, she talked
    to herself. “Something’s wrong with her head,” kids would say. She was always
    fidgeting with pens or Troll dolls. She tried to connect with her peers by taking
    on their interests as her own—the Goosebumps series of scary novels, the N.B.A.—but
    the attempts backfired, as when she printed out an N.B.A. schedule, laminated
    and color-coded it, and brought it to school as a conversation piece. She kept
    a notebook on “how to be human,” which included tips such as remembering to staple
    your worksheets at the top-left corner and acquiring a pair of the correct Filas.
    Nothing worked. “I wondered why I didn’t have friends, or if I even deserved friends,”
    Hammond said. She dreaded school so much that, on a few mornings, when she was
    supposed to be walking there, she instead tried to make it to her great-grandparents’
    house, some twenty-five miles away.'

  zh: 在二十世纪九十年代，蒂芙尼·汉蒙德（Tiffany Hammond）在德克萨斯州长大时，其他孩子因她的言语方式而取笑她：她说话声音太小，说话单调，词与词之间停顿时间太长，她不说够多，她自言自语。“她的脑子有问题，”孩子们会说。她总是在玩笔或娃娃。她试图通过采用他人的兴趣作为自己的兴趣来与同龄人建立联系——比如《阴险血脉》系列恐怖小说、N.B.A.——但这些尝试都以失败告终，比如她打印出一份N.B.A.赛程表，把它装订并用彩色标记，带到学校当作交流的话题。她还有一本关于“如何做人”的笔记本，其中包括如记得在作业纸上左上角装订和购买正确的Fila运动鞋等提示。但一切都无济于事。“我想知道为什么我没有朋友，甚至怀疑自己是否配得上朋友，”汉蒙德说。她非常害怕上学，以至于在几个早晨，当她应该走路去上学时，她反而试图走到她曾祖父母家，大约二十五英里远的地方。

    not sure if she intended to attempt suicide; she just wanted the noise and negativity
    in her head to stop. Her mother brought her to doctors who gave Hammond a prescription
    for Paxil and a diagnosis of Asperger’s syndrome, which, at the time, was recognized
    as an autism-related disorder that affects communication and social-emotional
    skills. She began going to a clinic for therapy twice a week, and continued for
    two years. “It was, ‘You have to sit right in the chair, you can’t cross your
    legs this way, you have to enunciate, no fidgeting,’ ” Hammond said. She might
    be asked to practice speaking clearly by reading the same paragraph from “Charlotte’s
    Web” out loud, over and over, and then do it again the next session. The work
    was tedious and difficult. “As a kid, you think, Why am I like this? Why can’t
    I *get* it?” Hammond said. “And then you have those times when you’re, like, Why
    can’t they just let me sit the way I want to sit?”

  zh: 当汤姆·汉蒙德（Tiffany Hammond）十二岁时，她服用了过量的泰诺。她告诉我，她不确定自己是否打算自杀；她只是想让头脑中的噪音和负面情绪停止。她的母亲带她去看医生，医生为汉蒙德开了帕萨尔（Paxil）的处方，并诊断为阿斯伯格综合症，当时被认为是一种影响沟通和社交情感技能的自闭症相关障碍。她开始每周两次去一家诊所接受治疗，并持续了两年。“那时候，他们会说，‘你必须坐得端正，不能像这样交叉双腿，必须发音清晰，不能坐立不安’，”汉蒙德说。有时她会被要求通过反复大声朗读《夏洛的网》中的同一段落来练习清晰地说话，然后在下一次会议上再做一次。这项工作既乏味又困难。“作为一个孩子，你会想，为什么我会这样？为什么我就是无法理解？”汉蒙德说。“然后你会有这样的时候，就像，为什么他们不能让我随心所欲地坐着呢？”
- en: It was not until she was in her late twenties that Hammond, an autistic advocate
    who is the author of the best-selling picture book “[A Day with No Words](https://www.amazon.com/Day-No-Words-Tiffany-Hammond/dp/1736949799),”
    realized that her childhood therapist was practicing something called Applied
    Behavior Analysis. A.B.A. therapy aims to build skills and habits that many autistic
    people do not have by breaking tasks down into small steps and reinforcing desired
    behaviors through repetition and rewards, which, with little kids, could take
    the form of candy or extra time with a favorite toy. Hammond had aged out of such
    incentives by the time she was enrolled in A.B.A., but earning praise from her
    therapists was reinforcement enough. “I wanted to please these adults. I wanted
    people to feel good being around me,” she said.

    疗法旨在通过将任务分解为小步骤，并通过重复和奖励强化期望的行为来培养许多自闭症人士缺乏的技能和习惯，这些奖励对小孩子来说可能是糖果或者额外的玩具时间。哈蒙德在开始接受A.B.A.治疗时已经超过了这些奖励的年龄，但从治疗师那里获得的赞扬足以成为奖励。“我想让这些成年人满意。我希望人们在我周围感到开心，”她说。
- en: A.B.A. is the only autism intervention that is approved by insurers and Medicaid
    in all fifty states. The practice is widely recommended for autistic kids who
    exhibit dangerous behaviors, such as self-injury or aggression toward others,
    or who need to acquire basic skills, such as dressing themselves or going to the
    bathroom. The mother of a boy with severe autism in New York City told me that
    her son’s current goals in A.B.A. include tolerating the shower for incrementally
    longer intervals, redirecting the urge to pull on other people’s hair, and using
    a speech tablet to say no. Another kid might be working on more complex language
    skills by drilling with flash cards or honing his ability to focus on academic
    work. Often, A.B.A. targets autistic traits that may be socially stigmatizing
    but are harmless unto themselves, such as fidgeting, avoiding eye contact, or
    stereotypic behaviors commonly known as stimming—rocking, hand-flapping, and so
    forth.

    中的目标包括逐渐延长耐受淋浴的时间间隔，转移拉别人头发的冲动，并使用语音平板说不。另一个孩子可能正在通过使用闪卡进行练习来提高更复杂的语言技能，或者提高他在学术工作上的专注能力。通常情况下，A.B.A.
    目标的自闭症特征可能在社交上具有污名化的影响，但本质上是无害的，例如烦躁不安，避免眼神接触，或者常被称为自我刺激的刻板行为——摇晃，拍手等等。

    some compare A.B.A. to conversion therapy. Social-media posts condemning the practice
    often carry the hashtag #ABAIsAbuse. The message that A.B.A. sends is that “your
    instinctual way of being is incorrect,” Zoe Gross, the director of advocacy at
    the nonprofit Autistic Self Advocacy Network, told me. “The goals of A.B.A. therapy—from
    its inception, but still through today—tend to focus on teaching autistic people
    to behave like non-autistic people.” But others say this criticism obscures the
    good work that A.B.A. can do. Alicia Allgood, a board-certified behavior analyst
    who co-runs an A.B.A. agency in New York City, and who is herself autistic, told

    hurts,’ rather than screaming or tantruming, with me having no idea that she needed
    to go to the dentist,” Singer said. Jodie used to have hours-long meltdowns during
    transitions. “A lot of kids with autism are not able to wait their turn,” Singer
    told me. “In A.B.A., she learned, over time, that *first* we will do this, and
    *then* we will do this”—for example, first, we’ll practice some new words, and
    then we can have some free time on the iPad. The intervals between “first” and

    中，她逐渐学会了‘先’我们做这个，‘然后’我们做那个”—例如，首先我们练习一些新单词，然后我们可以在iPad上自由活动。在“先”和“然后”之间的间隔可能从十秒开始，然后逐渐增加到三十秒，一分钟，等等。
- en: A generation ago, Singer said, “everyone who was diagnosed with autism got A.B.A.
    That type of one-size-fits-all treatment never really made sense for a child who
    had intact language or a high I.Q.” Now those children have grown up. “They’re
    talking about A.B.A. and how negative it was for them. But that doesn’t mean that
    we should eliminate it for the people who need it.” Singer’s position is, in part,
    a pragmatic one, but the debate over A.B.A. goes beyond practicalities. It is
    not simply a matter of whether a particular treatment works but what it means
    to be autistic, and what all autistic people do, or do not, have in common.

    辛格的立场在某种程度上是务实的，但关于A.B.A.的争论超越了实际问题。问题不仅仅是某种治疗是否有效，而是关于自闭症是什么意味着，以及所有自闭症患者有没有共同点。
- en: The origins of A.B.A. are undeniably disturbing. The person most closely associated
    with A.B.A.’s genesis is O. Ivar Lovaas, a clinical psychologist at U.C.L.A. who
    worked with severely autistic children. Beginning in the nineteen-sixties, Lovaas
    sometimes used “aversives”—shouting, slaps, and even electric shocks—to punish
    tantrums, stimming, and inattention in his child subjects. (Today, the Judge Rotenberg
    Center, in central Massachusetts, is believed to be the last institution in the
    U.S. that still administers electric shocks as part of A.B.A. therapy.) Some of
    the children in Lovaas’s care were not served regular meals, only receiving spoonfuls
    of food, such as sherbet, as rewards for complying with commands. And Lovaas openly
    shared appalling views of the autistic children he treated, once telling an interviewer
    that “they are not people in the psychological sense.”

  zh: A.B.A.的起源无可否认地令人不安。与A.B.A.的起源最紧密相关的人物是加州大学洛杉矶分校的临床心理学家O.伊瓦尔·洛瓦斯，他与严重自闭症儿童合作。从六十年代开始，洛瓦斯有时会使用“厌恶疗法”——对他的儿童主体的愤怒、耳光，甚至电击——来惩罚他们的发脾气、自我刺激和不注意行为。（今天，马萨诸塞州中部的Judge
    Rotenberg Center被认为是美国仍在进行A.B.A.治疗中施加电击的最后一个机构。）洛瓦斯照顾的一些儿童不会定期进食，只会在服从命令后得到雪利酒等食物的一勺作为奖励。而且洛瓦斯公开表达了对他治疗的自闭症儿童的令人震惊的看法，曾经告诉采访者，“从心理学意义上讲，他们不是人类。”
- en: In 1987, Lovaas authored a seminal study of sixty autistic children. In it,
    nearly half of the kids who were treated with an A.B.A. technique known as discrete
    trial training became, in Lovaas’s words, “indistinguishable from their normal
    friends.” “We would argue that that’s not a good goal in the first place,” Zoe
    Gross noted, dryly, “but, even for what it purports to do, which is to reduce
    the quote-unquote symptoms of autism, A.B.A. has not been rigorously proven to
    be good at that.” There is ample research, collected over decades, supporting
    the efficacy of A.B.A., but much of it is based on small studies and what are
    known as single-subject designs, in which subjects effectively serve as their
    own control group. Weighing the data also becomes more complex owing to the proliferation
    of A.B.A. subgenres, which tend to be more play-based and less repetitive than
    old-school A.B.A.

    有大量的研究资料在几十年间被收集，支持A.B.A.的有效性，但其中大部分是基于小规模研究和所谓的单一受试者设计，受试者在这些设计中有效地充当自己的对照组。由于A.B.A.的亚类的激增，这些数据的权衡也变得更加复杂，这些亚类往往更注重游戏性，而不是老式A.B.A.的重复性。

    do A.B.A., and it can be cheap, because these are basic principles of behavior

    and wage theft; message boards for A.B.A. providers overflow with horror stories
