    and image overhauls, but there’s never been anything quite like [Prince](https://variety.com/t/prince/)
    changing his name to an unpronounceable symbol on his 35th birthday, 30 years

  zh: 音乐界已经看到了无数次的再次发明、复原、转变和形象改造，但从未有过像[普林斯](https://variety.com/t/prince/)在35岁生日那天改变自己的名字为一个无法发音的符号这样的事情，距今已有30年了。
- en: His motivation for doing so was never clearly stated, although many assumed
    it was a ploy to get out of his contract with his longtime label, Warner Bros.
    Records. He announced the decision in a statement that read, “It is an unpronounceable
    symbol whose meaning has not been identified. It’s all about thinking in new ways,
    tuning in 2 a new free-quency.” Since, obviously, the symbol did not exist on
    a computer keyboard, Warner Bros. sent floppy discs to media outlets containing
    a digital rendition of the image, although most gradually landed on referring
    to him as “The Artist Formerly Known as Prince.” Television outlets were also
    provided with a brief video featuring the symbol, punctuated with an appropriately
    iconic-sounding digital clank, similar to the ones film companies used when their
    logos appeared in film credits.

  zh: 他这样做的动机从未明确表达过，尽管许多人认为这是他想要摆脱与他长期合作的唱片公司华纳兄弟唱片的合同的策略。他在一份声明中宣布了这个决定，声明中写道：“这是一个无法发音的符号，其含义尚未确定。这一切都是关于用新的方式思考，调谐到新的自由频率。”显然，由于该符号在计算机键盘上不存在，华纳兄弟向媒体提供了一些含有该图像的软盘，尽管大多数媒体最终都习惯称呼他为“曾被称为普林斯的艺术家”。电视台也提供了一个简短的视频，其中包含一个符号，以数字化的叮当声为特色，与电影公司在电影片尾字幕中出现时使用的声音类似。
- en: The symbol, originally a combination of the common gender symbols for male and
    female, previously had appeared in slightly different form in the artwork of several
    Prince albums, first on “1999” and later on the sleeves of “Purple Rain,” “Graffiti
    Bridge,” on tour laminates and the like. However, because that symbol could not
    be copyrighted, Prince hired Minneapolis design studio HDMG to alter it, adding
    a horn-like element. He copyrighted that version and first used it as the unpronounceable
    title of his otherwise title-less 1992 album, commonly referred to as “Love Symbol.”

    to get him out of his label contract — which had just been renewed in a purportedly
    “$100 million deal” — or had he finally lost it? There was no simple answer, and
    it’s hard not to imagine the ensuing bemusement, amusement and chatter were all

- en: He was slightly more expansive to Larry King that year. “I had to search deep
    within my heart and spirit, and I wanted to make a change and move to a new plateau
    in my life,” he said. “And one of the ways in which I did that was to change my
    name. It sort of divorced me from the past and all the hangups that go along with
    it. [He and Warner Bros.] had some issues that were basically about ownership
    of the music and how often I was supposed to record and things like that. We got

- en: Indeed, while Prince was one of the most successful acts on one of the most
    artist-friendly record companies in industry history, Warner Bros. was not about
    to redress his two main issues — that he couldn’t release music as often as he
    wanted, and the fact that the company, and not he, owned the rights to his recordings
    — especially when he’d just signed a lucrative new contract. His frustration with
    the situation grew increasingly contentious until he began painting the word “Slave”
    on his face and ultimately left the company when his contract was completed in
    1996\. (He actually signed a new, two-album deal with the label nearly 20 years
    later, but that’s a different story.)

    a cave with rounded walls and no windows and two couches facing his desk. Prince
    was sitting on one and I sat on the other one. Benny introduced me, “Prince, Jeff’s
    our new creative director, just came here from A&M Records. He thinks your album
    cover could be better.” And of the many, many times I saw Prince, I never once
    saw him where he wasn’t ready to walk onstage — you know, full hair, makeup, stage
    clothes — and he was wearing a fuchsia see-through shirt with pink pinstripes,
    with these fuchsia sort-of ski pants with a loop around the bottom of his boots.

    on the door, “I need to see you right away!” and he left! So it’s me facing Prince.

    A&M 唱片公司来这里。他认为你的专辑封面可以做得更好。”在我见到王子的众多时刻中，我从未见过他没有准备好上台——你知道的，满头头发，化了妆，穿着舞台服——他穿着一件紫红色的透明衬衫，上面有粉色的细条纹，还穿着这种紫红色的滑雪裤，裤脚有一个环绕在靴子底部。就在贝尼给王子传达了坏消息的时候，贝尼的律师开始敲门，“我需要立刻见你！”然后他离开了！所以只剩我和王子对视。

  zh: 有时候情况变得滑稽起来，因为派丽公园的人——在某种程度上，他们都害怕他们的老板——会打电话来说，“我的老板找你。” 然后我们会问，“那是谁，普林斯？”“嗯，我的老板。”“你的老板是谁？”我们只是在开玩笑，以友好的方式。
- en: The media was having a great time with it — with “The Artist Formerly Known
    as Prince” and the [typographical] abbreviation comes out. But really, it’s just
    another crazy thing. And when we were talking about the next album — which has
    been reverse-engineered to be called “Love Symbol” — he said, “I just want this
    [symbol], I want I don’t want my name on here,” and we were collaborating on all
    this stuff with him and it was all kind of good natured, even though he was talking
    in the press about how he’s a slave and Warner Bros. is fucking him over. He was
    basically the same guy I’d been dealing with.

  zh: 媒体对此乐此不疲——“前艺术家（原名普林斯）”和[排版]缩写词一直是热门话题。但实际上，这只是另一种疯狂的事情。当我们在讨论下一张专辑时——这张专辑后来被倒推成“爱的符号”——他说，“我只想要这个[符号]，我不想要我的名字在这里”，我们正在和他一起合作制作所有这些东西，虽然他在媒体上说他是一个奴隶，华纳兄弟在欺骗他。他基本上还是我一直在处理的那个人。
- en: '**PAGNOTTA**: The MTV piece of this is when Linda Corradina, who I think was
    their news director at that time, called me laughing. “I know you’re crazy. But
    this *crazy,* what are you doing?!” It was like a condolence conference because
    I honestly, honestly, thought my career was over. But we let all the bullshit
    pass, and people actually thought it was kind of interesting — silly, but interesting.'

- en: '**GOLD**: At one point he was in my office, and he’s kind of complaining that
    Warner Bros. won’t let him release all the albums he wants to release, basically
    saying, “Let me get off the label and finish the contract by just delivering a
    bunch of music” [which is essentially what he ultimately did]. He knows exactly
    what he’s doing and he knows *we* know exactly what he’s doing, so I say to him,
    “You know, we paid you a huge amount of money for each one of these records as
    an advance, and we need to be able to market them and release two and three singles
    and give the marketplace some space between them. We can’t just release a record
    every three months.” And it was really one of the few times he broke character
    with me, he says something like, “You know that everybody thinks these albums
    are carefully crafted, conceptualized things? I’m in the studio constantly, and
    when I get enough songs that I think, hey, together, there’s a record, it’s a
    record. So I have a lot of inventory and I want to release a lot of albums.” That
    was the one time we had a real conversation, rather than him kind of fronting
    one of those almost pantomime things he was famous for.'

  zh: '**戈尔德**: 有一次他在我的办公室里，有点抱怨说华纳兄弟不让他发行他想发行的所有专辑，基本上是在说，“让我离开这个唱片公司，通过交付一堆音乐来完成合同”[这基本上就是他最终所做的]。他清楚自己在做什么，也知道*我们*清楚他在做什么，所以我对他说，“你知道，我们为这些专辑每一张都支付了一大笔预付款，我们需要能够营销它们，发行两到三首单曲，并在它们之间给市场一些空间。我们不能每三个月就发行一张唱片。”那真的是他与我交谈的少数几次之一，他跟我打破角色说了一些话，大致是，“你知道每个人都认为这些专辑都是经过精心策划、构思的东西吗？我在录音室里不停地工作，当我有足够的歌曲，我认为，嘿，放在一起，就是一张唱片，那就是一张唱片。所以我有很多存货，我想发行很多专辑。”那是我们唯一一次真正交谈的时候，而不是他表演他以前著名的那种几乎是哑剧的东西之一。'
- en: It never got contentious with any of us — it might have gotten contentious with
    his lawyers talking to the business affairs people and things like that. But he
    was kin of doing his talking by press release, and he was showing up still at
    Warner Bros.’ offices and even at a marketing meeting — with the “slave” thing
    on his face! But there was never a time that he wasn’t talking to us or I couldn’t
    get him on the phone.

    back to Prince, which he retained for the rest of his life. He released albums

- en: '**PAGNOTTA**: I guess at some point he realized that it wasn’t really working,
    either legally or personally, and he did go through a tough period in the late
    ‘90s and early 2000s, when he got to release as much music as he wanted and nobody

    unheard of, but at the same time, like, incredibly modern, or something? Prince
    was such a cryptic dude. He would say things to me and I wouldn’t understand what
    the fuck he was talking about. But then I’d be driving six months later, and be
    like, *“Oooooh,* that’s what he meant.”'
