- en: William Mark Schwartz was a chemist living in Chicago and running a chemical
    company called the Mark Williams Chemical Company. Some of his employees complained
    of issues like fatigue, headaches, and indigestion which prompted him to create
    a beverage that would solve these issues. These complaints were more of the “*man,
    I am tired*” variety and not that Schwartz was working them to death. This beverage
    was Dr. Enuf, likely developed in 1949, for which Schwartz applied for a trademark
    on the 19th of May in 1951\. The trademark was granted on the 2nd of December
    in 1952, and the beverage was first sold commercially on the 4th of April in 1951\.
    The company produced paints and other products as well (being a chemical company),
    but Dr. Enuf is the most famous. The rights to the formula for Dr. Enuf were eventually
    bought by Charles Gordon of Tri-City Beverage in Johnson City, Tennessee.

    the Festival Cinema in Palo Alto sweeping floors, cleaning bathrooms, and running
    the projectors. He was a movie buff and this worked for him for some time. As
    his interest in working at the theater was beginning to wane, he began to long
    for a job in software development. In early February of 1977, Donald Knuth paid
    a visit to the theater and asked Ness what he was up to, Ness told him about his
    job search. The next day, Knuth got a call from Schwartz. Schwartz was searching

    months, which was just a guess on Ness’s part. He hated BASIC, but he was familiar
    enough with it, and he really wanted the job. On top of that, Schwartz was letting
    him work from home. With both parties satisfied, work began. Of course, this “working
    from home” was complicated. Disk drives of any kind were expensive and difficult
    to come by, so Ness commuted from Palo Alto to Pacific Grove where he used Gary
    Kildall’s computers until he purchased his own machine and disk drive later in
    the year. The BASIC that Ness built for the Mark Williams Company was XYBASIC.

    XYBASIC allowed the company to expand into operating systems. MWC purchased a
    PDP-11 in the late 1970s and began working on a UNIX clone. This would allow them,
    just as XYBASIC did, to offer a stellar product at a price far lower than any
    of the competition. COHERENT was first sold through OEMs for PDP-11 minicomputers
    in 1980\. However, it was quickly ported to the Zilog Z8000, the Motorola 68000,
