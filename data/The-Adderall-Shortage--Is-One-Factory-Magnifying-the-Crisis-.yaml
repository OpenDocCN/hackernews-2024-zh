    a drug manufacturer that operates out of Central Islip, Long Island, with an unusual
    request. She wanted to know if the company could bypass her pharmacy and directly
    fill her son’s prescription for the medication he took to treat attention deficit
    hyperactivity disorder. Ascent isn’t in the business of distributing a few pills
    here and there: In 2022, according to one research firm, it produced 12 percent
    of the country’s generic version of Adderall and large amounts of its generic
    Concerta, Ritalin, and Vyvanse. But now there was a global shortage of the drugs,
    and inquiries from people desperate to fill a prescription were becoming more

    to the DEA for allotments of raw chemical components. In Ascent’s case, that includes
    amphetamine (an active ingredient in Adderall), methylphenidate (Ritalin and Concerta),

    filed a lawsuit to compel the government to give a formal response to Ascent’s

    effort to rein in lax recordkeeping by drug manufacturers that had contributed
    to the opioid epidemic. “These companies have a legal obligation to account for
    every dose and every pill,” Anne Milgram, head of the DEA, said in a press release.
    In the face of an ongoing epidemic that had taken more than 110,000 lives in 2022,
    the DEA was “using every available tool to prevent the diversion and misuse of
    opioids and other highly addictive controlled substances.”

  zh: 2023年10月31日，一项重大公告发布。美国药品执法局（DEA）揭示，其对Ascent的调查是“瓶颈行动”（Operation Bottleneck）的一部分，旨在制止药品制造商的松懈记录保存，这些记录保存不善导致了阿片类药物流行病。DEA负责人安妮·米尔格拉姆在新闻发布会上表示：“这些公司有法律义务核算每一剂和每一颗药丸。”面对已造成2022年超过11万人死亡的持续流行病，DEA“利用一切可用工具防止阿片类药物和其他极易上瘾控制物质的滥用和转移”。
- en: The DEA didn’t distinguish between Ascent’s production of ADHD meds, which are
    stimulants, and its painkillers, which are narcotics. (According to Walden, 80
    percent of the company’s controlled-substances revenue comes from stimulants and
    20 percent from painkillers.) It alleged that Ascent had “failed to make records
    available for inspection in a timely manner and shipped controlled substances
    without producing required documentation” and that it “did not accurately account
    for millions of dosages” of oxycodone, methylphenidate, hydrocodone, amphetamines,
    and other drugs.

- en: For the DEA, Operation Bottleneck was a step toward redemption. During the painkiller
    epidemic, as state attorneys general and local governments brought hundreds of
    cases against opioid manufacturers and distributors, they routinely cited the
    DEA’s poor monitoring of the companies’ records as a factor that helped flood
    the country with OxyContin and similar drugs. Those suits eventually compelled
    large drug companies to pay $26 billion — the biggest such settlement since the
    tobacco case of 1998\. “DEA got the crap beat out of them,” says Krista Tongring,
    a former section chief in the agency’s office of compliance who now consults for
    Ascent. “They’re like, ‘We have to do something.’”

  zh: 对于DEA来说，“瓶颈行动”是向赎罪迈出的一步。在止痛药物流行期间，随着州检察长和地方政府对阿片类药物制造商和分销商提起数百起诉讼，他们经常提到DEA对公司记录监管不力是导致OxyContin等药物泛滥全国的因素之一。这些诉讼最终促使大型药企支付了260亿美元的和解金——自1998年烟草案以来最大的和解案。“DEA受到了很大的打击，”曾任该机构合规办公室部门主管现任Ascent顾问的克里斯塔·汤格林说道。“他们说，‘我们必须做点什么。’”
- en: Ascent’s lawsuit against the DEA describes the agency’s sanctions as “a clear
    and ill-conceived overcorrection and reaction to the criticism it received for
    mishandling of opioid abuse.” The suit also goes further, alleging that the DEA’s
    action reflects “a drug policy that is focused on controlling supply.” That language
    comes close to accusing the DEA of backdoor policy-making through regulation,
    as if the shortage of ADHD medications is the agency’s intent. Experts I spoke
    to dismissed that theory as far-fetched. “The DEA is a pretty straight agency.
    I can’t see them getting together with the FDA and saying, ‘Let’s just restrict
    quota.’ There must be a justification to increase or decrease quota,” says Joseph
    Rannazzisi, a former deputy assistant administrator of the DEA office of diversion

    drug companies for feeding the country’s nascent opioid addiction in the mid-2000s

    in recent years. “Everybody is concerned about the increase in use of stimulants,

    and diagnoses of ADHD vary, and can involve factors that are hard to measure objectively.
    The DSM instructs evaluators to use a [scoring method](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK519712/table/ch3.t3/)
    in which points are assigned if, say, a patient “often has difficulty organizing
    tasks” or “often loses things.” Some doctors may still use a version of the Conners
    Rating Scale, the first ADHD test developed in the 1970s. The scale’s developer
    later expressed deep concern over how easily evaluators were making the diagnosis.
    “The numbers make it look like an epidemic. Well, it’s not. It’s preposterous,”
    Dr. Keith Conners told the New York *Times* in 2013, four years before his death.

    to late diagnoses of ADHD versus misdiagnoses, but one thing is clear. It became
    much easier to get a prescription during the pandemic, in part because the DEA
    began allowing health-care providers to write prescriptions for controlled substances
    without meeting patients in person. The change allowed telehealth providers to
    issue stimulant prescriptions after relatively short video consultations, and
    many believe the shift ushered in abuse. In April 2022, a former executive at
    Cerebral, a telehealth start-up, filed a lawsuit claiming the company had pushed
    prescribers to write more scripts for ADHD meds because its data showed that patients
    were more likely to remain Cerebral customers if they’d been prescribed a stimulant.
    (A spokesperson for Cerebral denied the allegations, saying the company has never
    instructed providers to prescribe any drug in any quantity.) Cerebral stopped
    issuing the prescriptions the next month and disclosed that federal investigators
    had begun looking into the company; no charges were brought.

  zh: 没有人能说清楚最近处方激增的多少是由于ADHD的迟诊还是误诊造成的，但有一点是清楚的。在大流行期间，开处方变得更加容易，部分原因是美国禁毒局开始允许医疗提供者在没有亲自见患者的情况下开具受控物质的处方。这一改变使得远程医疗服务提供者可以通过相对较短的视频咨询后开具刺激剂处方，许多人认为这种变化导致了滥用的增加。2022年4月，一位Cerebral（一家远程医疗初创公司）的前高管提起诉讼，声称公司推动处方医师为ADHD药物开具更多处方，因为其数据显示，如果患者被开具了刺激剂处方，他们更有可能继续成为Cerebral的客户。（Cerebral的发言人否认了这些指控，称公司从未指示医疗提供者开具任何药物的处方以及数量。）该公司随后停止了开具这类处方，并披露联邦调查人员已开始调查该公司；但并未提出指控。
- en: Telehealth prescriptions are still permitted by the DEA, but many pharmacists
    at large chains, including Walmart, CVS, and Walgreens, are reluctant to fill
    them. To many observers in the industry, concerns about abuse of ADHD medications
    are outweighed by the harm done to the people with genuine diagnoses who can’t
    access the pills they need to function.

  zh: 美国禁毒局仍允许远程医疗处方，但包括沃尔玛、CVS和Walgreens在内的许多大型连锁药店的药剂师不愿意填写这些处方。在行业内，许多观察者认为对ADHD药物滥用的担忧被那些无法获得所需药丸以正常生活的真实诊断患者遭受的伤害所超过。
- en: Across the country, people unable to fill their prescriptions for Adderall and
    similar stimulants have been driven to extremes. They’ve rationed, splitting up
    tablets or breaking up capsules; they’ve spent hours driving to distant pharmacies;
    they’ve purchased pills on Craigslist or sought out dubious distributors in Mexico
    — anything to get their medication. “It’s a strange experience to be calling a
    pharmacist and getting heated saying, ‘I need this medication! When is it going
    to be in?!’” says a marketing director who went a month without her pills recently.
    “Why does it feel like I’m being treated like an addict?”

  zh: 全国范围内，无法拿到安非他明和类似刺激剂的处方的人们被迫采取极端措施。他们开始限量使用药片或者把胶囊打开分服；他们花费数小时驾车前往遥远的药房；他们在Craigslist购买药片或者寻找墨西哥的可疑分销商——任何方法都是为了获取他们的药物。“给药剂师打电话，然后火气冲冲地说‘我需要这种药物！它什么时候到货？！’是一种奇怪的体验，”一位最近一个月没有吃药的市场总监说道。“为什么感觉我被当成了一个瘾君子？”
- en: For some, a rise in stimulant prescriptions shouldn’t be a five-alarm fire at
    the DEA because the drugs simply don’t carry the same risks as opioids. “This
    isn’t an issue where people are dying from Adderall. They’re creating a fake epidemic,”
    says Jack Teitelman, a former DEA agent. He is now the president of Titan Group,
    which advises pharmaceutical manufacturers on compliance.

  zh: 对于一些人来说，刺激剂处方上升不应该成为美国禁毒局的火警，因为这些药物根本没有像阿片类药物那样的风险。前美国禁毒局特工杰克·泰特尔曼表示：“这并不是一个人们因为安非他明而死亡的问题。他们在制造一场虚假的流行病。”他目前是泰坦集团的总裁，该集团为制药厂商提供合规咨询服务。
- en: I also spoke to Heather Ferrarese, the second-generation owner of Bartle’s Pharmacy,
    which serves the 1,370 upstate residents of Oxford from a small storefront near
    a park lined with ginkgo and honey-locust trees — the picture of a small-town
    pharmacy. During the shortage, Ferrarese has been getting calls from people who
    live hours away, but she’s hesitant to take on new customers trying to fill ADHD
    scripts. “The last thing you want to do as a pharmacy is look like you’re an Adderall-pill
    mill,” Ferrarese says. “We don’t want to attract any unnecessary attention from
    the DEA.”

  zh: 我还与Bartle's Pharmacy的第二代业主Heather Ferrarese交谈过，该药店位于小公园附近，有银杏和蜂洲树，为纽约州北部牛津镇的1,370名居民提供服务——这是一家小镇药店的典型图景。在药物短缺期间，Ferrarese接到了来自几个小时外地区的人的电话，但她对于试图补充ADHD处方的新顾客持谨慎态度。“作为药店，你最不想显得像是在卖安非他明的小磨坊”，Ferrarese说。“我们不希望招致DEA的任何不必要的注意。”
- en: Ferrarese has a hard enough time filling prescriptions for her regulars. In
    January, the mother of a child with special needs tried to fill a prescription
    for FocalinXR, but Ferrarese had only two of the pills in stock and no way of
    getting more. The mother took the two pills, but doing so voided the prescription’s
    remaining 28 doses. (She later found another pharmacy with 11 pills, but getting
    them required obtaining another prescription.)

  zh: Ferrarese已经很难为常客提供处方服务了。今年一月份，一位有特殊需要孩子的母亲试图为FocalinXR处方，但Ferrarese只有两颗药丸，并且无法再获取更多。这位母亲吃了这两颗药丸，导致处方剩余的28次剂量作废。（后来她找到了另一家药店有11颗药丸，但需要另外获取处方才能获得。）
- en: “This poor child has been through probably 20 different medications before they
    found something that was effective and working for him,” Ferrarese says. “To have
    to look at a mom with a special-needs child that needs this medication and say,
    ‘Honestly, I don’t know what you’re going to do because we can’t get any more.
    We can’t get name-brand, we can’t get generic. There is just literally no option
    available.’ That’s very difficult. It puts everybody in a bind.”

  zh: “这个可怜的孩子在找到有效的药物之前可能尝试了大约20种不同的药物”，Ferrarese说。“要看着一个需要这种药物的特殊需要孩子的妈妈说，‘老实说，我不知道你该怎么办，因为我们无法再获取更多药物了。我们无法获得名牌，也无法获得仿制药。实际上没有其他选择。’这非常困难。这让每个人都束手无策。”
- en: 'For Ascent, one of the more frustrating parts of being told by the government
    to stop making Adderall is that other parts of the government have pleaded with
    the company to make more. The company says that on multiple occasions, officials
    from the FDA asked it to increase production in response to the shortage, and
    that Ron Wyden, the Democratic senator from Oregon, also pressed Ascent for help.
    They received responses similar to those the company gave the stressed-out callers
    looking for pills: Ascent didn’t have any information. Instead, the company directed
    them to the DEA.'

  zh: 对于Ascent来说，被政府告知停止生产安非他明最令人沮丧的部分之一是，政府的其他部门曾多次恳求该公司增加生产。公司表示，FDA的官员多次要求其增加产量以应对短缺，俄勒冈州的民主党参议员Ron
    Wyden也向Ascent施压以求帮助。他们收到的回复与那些寻找药丸的紧张电话者类似：Ascent没有任何信息。相反，公司把他们引导至DEA。
