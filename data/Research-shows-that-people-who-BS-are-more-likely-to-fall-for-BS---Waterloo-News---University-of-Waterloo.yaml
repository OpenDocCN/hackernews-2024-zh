- en: The researchers found that people who frequently engage in “persuasive bullshitting”
    were actually quite poor at identifying it. Specifically, they had trouble distinguishing
    intentionally profound or scientifically accurate fact from impressive but meaningless
    fiction. Importantly, these frequent BSers are also much more likely to fall for
    fake news headlines.

  zh: 研究人员发现，经常进行“有说服力的胡扯”的人实际上在识别这种行为上非常糟糕。具体来说，他们很难区分故意深奥或科学上准确的事实和令人印象深刻但毫无意义的虚构。重要的是，这些经常胡扯的人也更有可能上当受骗，信以为真一些假新闻标题。
- en: “It probably seems intuitive to believe that you can’t bullshit a bullshitter,
    but our research suggests that this isn’t actually the case,” says Shane Littrell,
    lead author of the paper and cognitive psychology PhD candidate at Waterloo. “In
    fact, it appears that the biggest purveyors of persuasive bullshit are ironically
    some of the ones most likely to fall for it.”

- en: The researchers define “bullshit” as information designed to impress, persuade,
    or otherwise mislead people that is often constructed without concern for the
    truth. They also identify two types of bullshitting— persuasive and evasive. “Persuasive”
    uses misleading exaggerations and embellishments to impress, persuade, or fit
    in with others, while ‘evasive’ involves giving irrelevant, evasive responses
    in situations where frankness might result in hurt feelings or reputational harm.

  zh: 研究人员将“胡扯”定义为旨在给人留下印象、说服或误导人的信息，通常是在不关心真相的情况下构建的。他们还确定了两种类型的胡扯——有说服力和逃避性。“有说服力”的胡扯使用误导性的夸张和修饰来给人留下印象、说服或与他人交流，而“逃避性”的胡扯涉及在可能导致情感伤害或名誉损害的情况下提供无关紧要的逃避性回应。
- en: In a series of studies conducted with over 800 participants from the US and
    Canada, the researchers examined the relations between participants’ self-reported
    engagement in both types of BSing and their ratings of how profound, truthful,
    or accurate they found pseudo-profound and pseudo-scientific statements and fake
    news headlines. Participants also completed measures of cognitive ability, metacognitive
    insight, intellectual overconfidence, and reflective thinking.

- en: “We found that the more frequently someone engages in persuasive bullshitting,
    the more likely they are to be duped by various types of misleading information
    regardless of their cognitive ability, engagement in reflective thinking, or metacognitive
    skills,” Littrell said. “Persuasive BSers seem to mistake superficial profoundness
    for actual profoundness. So, if something simply sounds profound, truthful, or
    accurate to them that means it really is. But evasive bullshitters were much better
    at making this distinction.”

  zh: “我们发现，一个人越经常进行有说服力的胡扯，他们就越可能被各种误导性信息愚弄，而不管他们的认知能力、反思性思维或元认知技能如何，” Littrell说道。“有说服力的胡扯者似乎会把表面上的深奥误认为真正的深奥。所以，如果某事听起来简单地深奥、真实或准确，对他们来说那就是真的。但逃避性的胡扯者在做出这种区分上要好得多。”
