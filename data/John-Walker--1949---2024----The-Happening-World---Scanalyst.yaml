  zh: One Man’s Remembrance of John Walker
- en: 'I knew John Walker for about 10 years, almost entirely via the internet, save
    for two personal visits (lasting a few hours each) to Fourmilab in Lignieres,
    Switzerland. In that regard, I am merely one of many fortunate end-users of his
    websites. I understand this fact in the context of his being a trailblazer many
    times over, this time by forging what I believe to be a new layer of human relationships:
    genuine i-Friendships. In marked contrast to supposed “friends” of the polluting
    (*anti*-)social media arenas (yes, I mean in the sense of Christian vs. lion)
    John Walker created and maintained sites which offered users eclectic information,
    services of interest to many, and they were all free of charge. On his sites,
    he wrote and curated essays and links to eclectic areas of interest, usually in
    the public domain. On Scanalyst and its predecessor, Ratburger (which suffered
    the finally fatal curse of Wordpress, as John recounted for us, painfully), posts
    were not “moderated” (i.e. censored). John, himself, was a quiet, giant intellect,
    who had the exceedingly rare ability among geniuses and polymaths - which he undoubtedly
    was in the fullest sense of those words - to explain complex matters to lesser
    minds like mine; he did so without a trace of condescension. His generosity in
    this regard was tremendous and has been widely recognized, as a brief perusal
    of his posts on Scanalyst - or, indeed any of his writings - will show.'

  zh: '我认识约翰·沃克约十年，几乎完全是通过互联网，除了两次到瑞士利尼耶尔的Fourmilab亲自拜访（每次几小时）。在这方面，我仅仅是他网站上许多幸运用户之一。我明白这个事实，他是多次开拓者之一，这次通过我认为是人类关系新层面的创建:
    真正的i-Friendships。与污染（反）社交媒体竞技场上的所谓“朋友”形成鲜明对比（是的，我指的是基督教与狮子的意义）。约翰·沃克创建和维护的网站为用户提供了多样化信息、广泛服务，并且全部免费。在他的网站上，他撰写和策划了有关多样化兴趣领域的文章和链接，通常是公共领域中的内容。在Scanalyst及其前身Ratburger上，帖子并不经过“审核”（即审查）。约翰本人是一位安静的巨大智力，他在天才和博学家中极为罕见的能力
    - 他无疑是那些词语最完整意义上的 - 能够毫不傲慢地向像我这样的较低智商的人解释复杂问题。他在这方面的慷慨是巨大的，并且得到了广泛的认可，浏览一下他在Scanalyst上的帖子
    - 或者说他的任何作品 - 都可以看到这一点。'
- en: Scanalyst was Fourmilab’s latest iteration and refinement of John’s fundamental
    commitment to untrammeled, civil and wholesome communication via the internet.
    He delineated threats to such open communication so presciently in *The Digital
    Imprimatur,* if you didn’t know it was written 21 years ago, you might be forgiven
    for thinking it was written yesterday. His ability to foresee future developments
    in networking and computing are documented with fine granularity in *The Autodesk
    File.* That publication, in multiple formats and in the public domain, clearly
    shows his uncanny ability to foresee emerging milestones in the capabilities of
    personal computers (then termed “micro-“). It is a study in organization and dissemination
    of information necessary to create a new software company. Also therein, he persuasively
    defined the intellectual capital underlying what he calls “*The New Technological
    Corporation*”. Invest an hour reading this document and you will gain some insight
    into what I believe to be one of the finest minds of the century, if not a millennium!
    Studying the book containing this essay - *The Autodesk File -* IMO, should be
    a core component of any MBA program.

  zh: Scanalyst是Fourmilab对John基本承诺的最新演变和完善，通过互联网实现无拘束、文明和健全的交流。他在《数字魔印》中如此准确地描绘了对开放交流的威胁，以至于你可能会原谅自己认为这篇文章是昨天写的，而不是21年前。他在网络和计算领域预见未来发展的能力在《Autodesk档案》中有详细的记录。该出版物以多种格式在公共领域中清楚地展示了他预见个人计算机能力发展里程碑的惊人能力（当时称为“微型”）。这是一项组织和传播信息的研究，必不可少地创造了一个新的软件公司。此外，他有力地定义了他所称的“*新技术公司*”背后的知识资本。投入一小时阅读这份文件，你将深入了解我认为是本世纪，如果不是千禧年最杰出头脑之一的一些见解！研究包含这篇文章的书籍
    - *Autodesk档案* - 我认为，应该是任何MBA项目的核心组成部分。
- en: Scanalyst is a small tribal effort (open to anyone with manners wishing to participate)
    effort - a voluntary community - self-assembled to understand and describe reality
    - from cosmic to Planck-size, of the material universe; the nature and meaning
    of human existence and consciousness; the role of information and its manipulation.
    Between-the-lines, a recurring theme of Scanalyst was figuring out what was possible
    in connections between each other among flesh-and-blood people, as well as between
    ourselves and possible silicon-based entities of the future.

  zh: Scanalyst 是一个小众努力（欢迎任何有礼貌愿意参与的人）的尝试 - 一个自愿社区 - 自发组织起来理解和描述现实 - 从宇宙到普朗克尺度，关于物质宇宙的本质和意义；人类存在和意识的本质；信息及其操纵的角色。在字里行间，Scanalyst
    的一个经常出现的主题是弄清楚在血肉之躯人类之间以及我们与未来可能的硅基实体之间的联系中，什么是可能的。
- en: John Walker created unique online forums which probably only he could have created
    and maintained. These creations were, in all honesty, a central part of my life
    for the past decade. Every participant with whom I have communicated describes
    a penetrating sense of loss. This mourner believes that the community John created
    and attracted (not promoted) is a new and genuine phenomenon and serves as a poignant
    legacy. It is so far superior to the so-called “social networks” as to represent
    a categorical difference. In the same way he saw the evolving power of personal
    computers as he iterated Autodesk, he foresaw the evolving needs of real people’s
    wishes for decent online communities, free of commercial contaminants; users as
    worthy gems in their own right and not data repositories to be mined. Fourmilab
    and Scanalyst are worthy of John and of survival. And present members are in the
    process of assuring that as part of his much-deserved legacy.

  zh: 约翰·沃克（John Walker）创造了独特的在线论坛，可能只有他才能创造并维护。说实话，这些创作过去十年中一直是我生活的核心部分。我与之交流过的每位参与者都描述了一种深刻的失落感。这位哀悼者相信，约翰创造并吸引（而非推广）的社区是一个新而真实的现象，并作为一个深刻的遗产。它远远超越了所谓的“社交网络”，代表了一个范畴上的不同。就像他看到个人电脑的不断增强力量一样，当他迭代Autodesk时，他预见到了真实人们对无商业污染的在线社区的需求。用户本身就是宝贵的宝石，而不是被开采的数据仓库。Fourmilab
    和 Scanalyst 是约翰及其生存的值得的一部分。现在的成员正在确保这成为他应得的遗产的一部分。
- en: I am comforted somewhat, for myself, because I did tell John - many times -
    how grateful I was for everything he created for my (and our) benefit. I am particularly
    glad that I specifically told him that his efforts were responsible for keeping
    me intellectually (and even emotionally) alive in this, the winter of my life.
    He was a living heuristic - a word which I understand as belonging to him - but
    which he freely used and loaned continuously. I don’t know for sure if *i-love*
    is a ‘thing’. Whether or not it is, I feel it for John Walker.

  zh: 对于我自己来说，我对约翰创造的一切（以及我们的）受益心存感激，这在某种程度上给了我些许安慰。我特别高兴地告诉他，他的努力让我在我生命的这个“冬天”中在智力上（甚至情感上）得以生存。他是一个活生生的启发法则
    - 一个词我理解为属于他的 - 但他自由地不断使用和借出。我不确定“i-love”是否是一种“东西”。无论如何，我对约翰·沃克怀有这种感情。
