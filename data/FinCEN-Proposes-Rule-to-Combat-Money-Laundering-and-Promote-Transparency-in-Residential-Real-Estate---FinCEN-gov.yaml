- en: WASHINGTON—Today, the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement
    Network (FinCEN) issued a [Notice of Proposed Rulemaking](https://www.federalregister.gov/public-inspection/2024-02565/anti-money-laundering-regulations-for-residential-real-estate-transfers) to
    combat and deter money laundering in the U.S. residential real estate sector by
    increasing transparency.

  zh: 华盛顿——今天，美国财政部的金融犯罪执法网络（FinCEN）发布了一份[规则草案通告](https://www.federalregister.gov/public-inspection/2024-02565/anti-money-laundering-regulations-for-residential-real-estate-transfers)，旨在通过增加透明度来打击和阻止美国住宅房地产行业中的洗钱活动。
- en: The proposed rule would require certain professionals involved in real estate
    closings and settlements to report information to FinCEN about non-financed transfers
    of residential real estate to legal entities or trusts. FinCEN’s proposal is tailored
    to target residential real estate transfers considered to be high-risk for money
    laundering, while minimizing potential business burden, and it would not require
    reporting of transfers made to individuals.

  zh: 提议的规定将要求参与房地产成交和结算的特定专业人士向FinCEN报告关于将住宅房地产非融资转让给法律实体或信托的信息。FinCEN的提议旨在针对被视为洗钱高风险的住宅房地产转让，同时尽量减少潜在的商业负担，并不要求对转让给个人的情况进行报告。
- en: “Illicit actors are exploiting the U.S. residential real estate market to launder
    and hide the proceeds of serious crimes with anonymity, while law-abiding Americans
    bear the cost of inflated housing prices,” said FinCEN Director Andrea Gacki.
    “Today marks an important step toward not only curbing abuse of the U.S. residential
    real estate sector, but safeguarding our economic and national security.”

  zh: “非法行为者正在利用美国住宅房地产市场来洗钱和隐藏严重犯罪的所得，以匿名方式进行，而守法美国人则承担了房价飙升的成本，”FinCEN主任安德烈娅·加基说。“今天标志着不仅遏制美国住宅房地产部门滥用的重要一步，还有保护我们的经济和国家安全。”
- en: The proposed rule describes the circumstances in which a report would be filed;
    who would file a report; what information would need to be provided, including
    information about the beneficial owners of the legal entities and trusts; and
    when a report about the transaction would be due. Data from the reports would
    assist the Department of the Treasury and its law enforcement and national security
    partners in addressing vulnerabilities that leave the U.S. residential real estate
    market exposed to abuse by illicit actors.

  zh: 提议的规则描述了应提交报告的情况；谁将提交报告；需要提供的信息，包括有关法律实体和信托的受益所有人信息；以及何时应提交关于交易的报告。报告中的数据将协助财政部及其执法和国家安全伙伴解决使美国住宅房地产市场容易受到非法行为者滥用的漏洞。
- en: The proposed rule is consistent with the Bank Secrecy Act’s longstanding directive
    to extend anti-money laundering measures to the real estate sector and builds
    on the success of FinCEN’s Real Estate Geographic Targeting Order program, which
    has demonstrated the need for increased transparency and further regulation of
    this sector nationwide. Under the proposed rule, persons involved in real estate
    closings and settlements would continue to be exempt from the anti-money laundering
    compliance program requirements of the Bank Secrecy Act.

  zh: 提议的规则符合《银行保密法》长期以来的指令，即将反洗钱措施扩展到房地产行业，并建立在FinCEN的房地产地理定位订单计划取得成功的基础上，该计划已经表明需要增加透明度并进一步全国性地对这一行业进行监管。根据提议的规定，参与房地产成交和结算的人员将继续免于银行保密法反洗钱合规程序的要求。

    to the proposed rule. Comments will be accepted for 60 days following publication
    in the *Federal Register*.
