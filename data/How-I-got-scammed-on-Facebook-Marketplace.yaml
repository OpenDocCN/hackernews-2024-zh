- en: A few weeks ago, I got scammed buying a camera on Facebook Marketplace.
  id: totrans-split-6

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 几周前，我在Facebook Marketplace上买相机时上当受骗了。
- en: I bought the camera from a profile that was created in 2017\. They had some
    other things for sale, too. The account looked legit — lots of family photos and
    comments from family members.
  id: totrans-split-7
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 我从一个2017年创建的个人资料购买了这台相机。他们还有其他东西出售。账号看起来很真实 —— 很多家庭照片和家人的评论。
- en: I paid $1,030 using PayPal, selecting “Goods and Services” because I knew I’d
    be protected by PayPal in case of a scam.
  id: totrans-split-8

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 我用PayPal支付了1030美元，选择了“货物和服务”，因为我知道如果有欺诈行为，PayPal会保护我。
- en: They didn’t ship out the item that evening or the next day, so I got antsy and
    texted them. They finally sent me a UPS tracking link for my package, but then
    they immediately said they were very worried because I had opened a PayPal claim
    against them. I had not. I checked my PayPal account. *I had?* They pleaded with
    me to close it.

  zh: 当天晚上或第二天他们没有发货，所以我变得不安，给他们发了短信。最终他们给我发送了一个UPS追踪链接，但随后他们立即表示他们非常担心，因为我已经对他们提出了PayPal索赔。我没有。我检查了我的PayPal账户。*我真的有？*
    他们请求我关闭它。
- en: I know that I didn’t open it. I was eating dinner at the time that it was opened.
  id: totrans-split-10

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 我知道我当时没有打开它。那时候我正在吃晚饭。
- en: But I realized that, once you close a case on PayPal, you can’t open it again.
    So when the package arrived and was something else, I would have no recourse.
  id: totrans-split-11
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 但我意识到，一旦你在PayPal上关闭了一个案件，你就无法再次打开它。所以当包裹到达并变成了其他东西时，我将没有任何补救措施。
- en: Instead of closing it, I pretended that I couldn’t see the case on my end and
    even sent doctored screenshots of the case not showing up.
  id: totrans-split-12
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 我没有关闭它，而是假装我看不到我的端，甚至发送了篡改的案件截图。
- en: The next morning, I called PayPal and asked them how the seller could’ve opened
    a case on my behalf against themselves. They weren’t sure.

  zh: 第二天早上，我打电话给PayPal询问他们如何让卖家代表我对他们自己开启一个案件。他们不确定。
- en: I kept the case open. A few days later, while on a bike ride, I received an
    email that the case had been closed. By me. By me?? I didn’t do that.

  zh: 我保持案件开启。几天后，我在骑自行车时收到一封邮件，说案件已经被我关闭。是我关闭的？我没有这么做过。
- en: I raced home and called PayPal. Again, they didn’t know how that was possible.
    But they were understanding and explained that, once the package arrived and wasn’t
    a camera, I actually could open another case. You just can’t open a case a second
    time for the *same issue*. But the scammer opened an “Item not received” case
    against themselves, and I could file again as “Item not as described.”

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 我匆忙回家并打电话给PayPal。他们再次不知道这是如何可能的。但他们很理解并解释说，一旦包裹到达并不是相机，我实际上可以再次打开一个案件。只是你不能因为*同一个问题*第二次打开案件。但骗子却为自己打开了一个“未收到物品”的案件，我可以再次以“描述不符”为由提起诉讼。
- en: The UPS package was delivered a few days later — according to the tracking number,
    at least. It was signed for by “ATWOOD.” I don’t know anyone named Atwood.
  id: totrans-split-16

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 几天后UPS包裹送达 —— 根据追踪号码，至少是这样。它由“ATWOOD”签收。我不认识任何叫Atwood的人。
- en: I called UPS. For security reasons, they couldn’t tell me where the package
    was headed, but they did confirm that it wasn’t my address or my name. It was
    an address in Lexington though, so the UPS tracking website would show “Lexington,
    MA” (but it doesn’t show the exact address, which the scammer must’ve known).
  id: totrans-split-17
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 我打电话给UPS。出于安全考虑，他们不能告诉我包裹的目的地，但他们确认这不是寄往我的地址或我的名字。它是一个在列克星敦的地址，因此UPS跟踪网站会显示“Lexington,
    MA”（但不显示具体地址，这位骗子肯定知道）。
- en: I called PayPal again and explained. They took the tracking number and called
    UPS, and were somehow able to find out exactly where the package was heading.
    (This feels like it was against UPS protocol.)
  id: totrans-split-18
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 我再次打电话给PayPal并解释。他们获取了跟踪号码并致电UPS，竟然能够确切地找出包裹的目的地。（这感觉违反了UPS的协议。）
- en: I looked up the address and found that it was for Lincoln Labs, an MIT lab in
    Lexington. I guess the scammer chose a random commercial address that was in Lexington.
  id: totrans-split-19

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 我查找了这个地址，发现这是林肯实验室，也就是麻省理工学院在列克星敦的实验室。我猜这个骗子选择了一个随机的商业地址在列克星敦。
- en: They logged all this as evidence, and re-opened the “Item not received” claim.
    The scammer now had 10 days to provide evidence to the contrary, otherwise I would
    automatically be refunded.
  id: totrans-split-20

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 他们把这些都记录为证据，并重新打开了“未收到物品”索赔。骗子现在有10天的时间提供相反的证据，否则我将自动获得退款。
- en: 10 days later, I woke up to see that the scammer had added a tracking number
    to the case. It was the same tracking number they had given me, the one that PayPal
    knew wasn’t headed to me, so that was perfect. I logged into PayPal, and… *I*
    had closed the case. Again. This time at 2am, while I was asleep.
  id: totrans-split-21
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 十天后，我醒来发现骗子已经在案件中添加了一个追踪号码。这是他们之前给我的那个追踪号码，PayPal知道这个号码并不是寄给我的，所以非常完美。我登录PayPal，然后…
    *案件被我自己关闭了*。再次关闭。这次是在凌晨两点，我正在睡觉的时候。
- en: I spent 2.5 hours on Saturday morning calling PayPal, and eventually got to
    someone who was very helpful. I had to explain that I actually *didn’t* close
    that case. They re-opened the case for a second time, and escalated it so the
    “back-office team” could review in a few days. I just hoped that the scammer wouldn’t
    close the case on my behalf for a third time.

  zh: 星期六早上，我花了2.5小时打电话给PayPal，最终找到一个非常有帮助的人。我不得不解释，实际上*我并没有*关闭那个案件。他们第二次重新开启了案件，并将其升级，以便“后勤团队”在几天内进行审查。我只希望骗子不会再代表我第三次关闭案件。
- en: 'A few days later, I received the final update: I was refunded $1,030\. *whew.*'
  id: totrans-split-23

  zh: 几天后，我收到了最后的更新：我被退款了$1,030。*呼~*
- en: I’m still not sure how the scammer was able to open and close cases on my behalf.
    My theory is that they were able to spoof my phone number and call PayPal support
    and do it over the phone. (They asked early on for my phone number “for the tracking
    information,” which in retrospect doesn’t make a lot of sense.)
  id: totrans-split-24
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 我仍然不确定骗子是如何能代表我开启和关闭案件的。我的理论是，他们可能伪造了我的电话号码，并通过电话联系PayPal客服进行操作。（他们早些时候要求我的电话号码“用于追踪信息”，回想起来这并不合理。）
- en: But in any case, I got my money back! Thanks PayPal :)
