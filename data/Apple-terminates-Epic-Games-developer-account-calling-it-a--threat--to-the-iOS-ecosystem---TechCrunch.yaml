- en: The Apple-Epic saga has taken a new turn today as the Fortnite game developer,
    Epic Games, [shared](https://www.epicgames.com/site/en-US/news/apple-terminated-epic-s-developer-account)
    that Apple has terminated its developer account. This is a reversal from [the
    earlier approval of Epic’s account last month](https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/16/fortnite-will-return-to-ios-in-europe-thanks-to-dma/),
    which Epic said would allow it to bring back Fortnite to iOS devices in the EU
    by way of the region’s new law, the Digital Markets Act (DMA). But Epic now says
    Apple’s lawyers have sent it a letter saying it’s terminating its Epic Games Sweden
    AB account — a move Epic calls a “serious violation of the DMA” and an indication
    that Apple has no intention of “allowing true competition on iOS devices.”

  zh: 今天，随着Fortnite游戏开发商Epic Games [分享](https://www.epicgames.com/site/en-US/news/apple-terminated-epic-s-developer-account)，Apple终止了其开发者账户，使得Apple与Epic之间的战斗故事今天迎来了新的转折点。这与[上个月批准Epic账户的情况](https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/16/fortnite-will-return-to-ios-in-europe-thanks-to-dma/)正好相反，Epic表示这将使其通过欧盟的新法律数字市场法（DMA）将Fortnite重新引入iOS设备。但是Epic现在表示，苹果的律师们已经发来了一封终止其Epic
    Games Sweden AB账户的信函 —— 这一行动被Epic称为“DMA的严重违反”，并表明苹果没有“允许iOS设备上的真正竞争意图”。
- en: “In terminating Epic’s developer account, Apple is taking out one of the largest
    potential competitors to the Apple App Store. They are undermining our ability
    to be a viable competitor and they are showing other developers what happens when
    you try to compete with Apple or are critical of their unfair practices,” writes
    Epic on its company blog, where it has also published copies of its correspondence
    with Apple.

  zh: “通过终止Epic的开发者账户，苹果摒弃了其在Apple App Store上的最大潜在竞争对手之一。他们正在破坏我们成为可行竞争者的能力，并向其他开发者展示，当你试图与苹果竞争或批评他们的不公平做法时，会发生什么，”Epic在其公司博客上写道，并在那里发布了其与苹果通信的副本。
- en: The game developer alleges that one of the reasons Apple provided to support
    its decision was Epic’s criticism of Apple’s proposed DMA rules, [including this
    post on X](https://x.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1762243725533532587?s=20) (formerly
    Twitter) by Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney. Of course, Epic has been a thorn in Apple’s
    side, having taken it to court over antitrust concerns and lobbying for regulations
    in multiple markets to crack down on Apple’s power and influence over the app
    economy. As a result, Apple would rather be done with Epic, it seems. According
    to Epic, Apple reportedly told the company that it’s “a threat to their ecosystem.”

  zh: 游戏开发商声称，苹果提供支持其决定的理由之一是Epic批评了苹果提议的DMA规则，[包括Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney在X（曾用名Twitter）发布的这篇帖子](https://x.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1762243725533532587?s=20)。当然，Epic一直是苹果的心头肉，因为它曾因反垄断问题将苹果告上法庭，并在多个市场游说监管机构打击苹果在应用经济中的权力和影响。因此，苹果似乎宁愿结束与Epic的合作。据Epic称，苹果据称告知公司，Epic“对其生态系统构成威胁”。
- en: However, Epic said that it has [publicly shared its intentions](https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/news/epic-games-store-2023-year-in-review)
    and then again assured Apple in writing that it would agree with all the terms
    of its developer agreements after requesting one of the DMA consultations that
    Apple is offering its App Store developers. (The request was initially denied).
    It was after agreeing to abide by its rules that Apple’s lawyers sent a letter
    terminating its Epic Games Sweden AB account.

  zh: 然而，Epic表示，它已经[公开分享了其意图](https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/news/epic-games-store-2023-year-in-review)，并再次书面向Apple保证，在请求了Apple为其App
    Store开发者提供的DMA咨询之后，它将同意其开发者协议的所有条款（最初请求被拒绝）。是在同意遵守其规则之后，Apple的律师们发送了一封终止其Epic
    Games Sweden AB账户的信函。

  zh: Epic声称这家科技巨头在报复其发言，由苹果高管菲尔·席勒（Phil Schiller）撰写的一封信表明了这一点。
- en: “In the past, Epic has entered into agreements with Apple and then broken them,”
    Schiller reminds the game maker in the letter dated February 23, 2024\. “You also
    testified that Epic deliberately violated Apple’s rules, to make a point and for
    financial gain. More recently, you have described our DMA compliance as ‘hot garbage,’
    a ‘horror show,’ and a ‘devious new instance of Malicious Compliance.’ And you
    have complained about what you called ‘Junk Fees’ and ‘Apple taxes.”

  zh: “在过去，Epic 曾与苹果达成协议，然后违反了这些协议，” Schiller 在信中提醒这家游戏开发商，信件日期为 2024 年 2 月 23 日。“你还作证称，Epic
    故意违反了苹果的规则，以表达观点并谋取财务收益。最近，你称我们的 DMA 遵从情况为‘糟糕透顶’、‘可怕的表演’和‘恶意遵从的新实例’。你还抱怨了所谓的‘垃圾费用’和‘苹果税’。”
- en: Schiller suggests that Epic’s “colorful criticism” combined with its past actions
    “strongly suggests that Epic Sweden does not intend to follow the rules.” He adds
    that another intentional breach could “threaten the integrity of the iOS platform,
    as well as the security and privacy of users.”

  zh: 针对 Epic 的消息，苹果发表了以下声明：
- en: Epic’s egregious breach of its contractual obligations to Apple led courts to
    determine that Apple has the right to terminate ‘any or all of Epic Games’ wholly
    owned subsidiaries, affiliates, and/or other entities under Epic Games’ control
    at any time and at Apple’s sole discretion.’ In light of Epic’s past and ongoing
    behavior, Apple chose to exercise that right.

  zh: Epic 对其向苹果的合同义务的严重违约行为导致法院裁定苹果有权随时根据其裁量权终止‘Epic Games 完全拥有的子公司、关联公司和/或其他受 Epic
    Games 控制的实体’。鉴于 Epic 的过去和持续的行为，苹果选择行使了这一权利。
- en: The company also told us its right to terminate Epic’s account is based on the
    September 2021 judgment which resulted from Epic’s litigation against Apple. This
    judgment stated that “Apple has the contractual right to terminate its DPLA with
    any or all of Epic Games’ wholly owned subsidiaries, affiliates, and/or other
    entities under Epic Games’ control at any time and at Apple’s sole discretion.”

  zh: 该公司还告诉我们，根据 2021 年 9 月的裁决，其终止 Epic 的账户的权利基于 Epic 就苹果的诉讼所作出的判决。判决指出，“苹果有权根据其自身的单方面决定随时终止与
    Epic Games 完全拥有的子公司、关联公司和/或其他受 Epic Games 控制的实体的 DPLA 协议。”
- en: Apple noted, too, that Epic Games Sweden entered into the Apple Developer Progam
    License Agreement via a click-through agreement, which had not involved any executive
