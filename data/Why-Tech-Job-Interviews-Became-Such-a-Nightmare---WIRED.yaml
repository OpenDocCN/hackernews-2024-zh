    say it was “10,000 percent true!” She added that over-the-top interviews are a
    long-established problem in parts of the industry. During a past job search, she
    [tweeted](https://x.com/SashaMTL/status/1760771939931505024?s=20), one Big Tech
    company “made me do *12* interviews and a take-home assignment.” (Luccioni declined
    to say which company put her through that ordeal.)

    to job candidates. Interviewing.io, a testing platform where software engineers
    can hone their skills in mock job interviews, [released a report this week](https://interviewing.io/blog/how-to-negotiate-with-meta)
    alleging that Meta has recently been using questionable negotiation tactics with
    candidates who make it through the interview gauntlet.

  zh: 像是对处于压力下的招聘经理的勤奋举动，对求职者来说可能显得不公平。Interviewing.io是一个测试平台，软件工程师可以在模拟的求职面试中磨练技能，[本周发布了一份报告](https://interviewing.io/blog/how-to-negotiate-with-meta)，指控Meta最近在与通过面试关卡的候选人进行谈判时使用了可疑的策略。
- en: Aline Lerner, Interviewing.io founder and CEO, says that out of six Big Tech
    firms—Google, Meta, Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, and Netflix—Meta has had the greatest
    uptick in hiring over the past 12 months, despite making contemporaneous layoffs.
    This also gives Meta unique leverage over interview candidates, who are unlikely
    to have competing offers from other giants.

  zh: Interviewing.io创始人兼CEO Aline Lerner称，Meta在过去12个月内与Google、Amazon、Apple、Microsoft和Netflix这六家大科技公司相比，招聘增长最快，尽管同时进行了裁员。这也使得Meta在面试候选人中拥有独特的筹码，因为他们不太可能获得来自其他巨头的竞争性职位提议。
- en: Lerner says she evaluated 20 interview offers that Interviewing.io clients received
    from Meta over the past several months, and found that the company was often “down-leveling”
    engineering candidates by offering a lower-ranked position than a person originally
    interviewed for.

  zh: Lerner表示，她评估了Interviewing.io客户在过去几个月收到的20份Meta面试邀约，并发现该公司经常通过向工程师候选人提供比最初面试职位低一级的职位来“降级”他们。
- en: She also says Meta has been offering engineers salaries as much as $50,000 below
    the average total compensation levels for similar jobs at other companies. A job
    candidate has a decent chance of negotiating for more if they have competing job
    offers, but those offers are hard to come by in a tight tech market.

  zh: 她还表示，Meta为工程师提供的薪水往往低于其他公司类似职位的平均总补偿水平高达$50,000。如果求职者有竞争性的工作机会，他们有很大机会争取更高的薪酬，但在竞争激烈的技术市场上，这样的机会并不多见。
- en: “This was such a stark pattern,” Lerner tells WIRED, referring to the low-ball
    offers. “I was initially going to send this guide to just our users but then thought
    the broader engineering community would get value out of it.”

- en: On a recent earnings call, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said the company has a backlog
    of positions to fill from last year, and that it plans to swap out certain job
    types for others this year. Although it has laid off tens of thousands of workers
    [since the end of 2022](https://www.wired.com/story/meta-layoffs-overhiring/),
    the company has indicated that its compensation philosophy and its compensation
    bands—salary ranges for different roles—haven’t changed in recent years.

- en: Meta spokesperson Stacey Yip says the company strives to be fair and equitable
    to every job candidate. “Our hiring philosophy allows us to evaluate individuals
    based on their potential impact across various teams and match each candidate
    with a role and level that aligns with their skill set and career aspirations,”
    she says. Yip declined to respond to the claim that it will sometimes offer engineering
    salaries $50,000 below what might be expected.

- en: Amanda Richardson, CEO of CoderPad, a platform used by hiring managers to assess
    coding skills, says tech companies could make life easier for both job candidates
    and hiring managers by questioning the recent industry-wide shift to tougher assessments.
    Asking more of candidates can end up wasting time on both sides, she says, and
    exclude strong potential hires.

  zh: CoderPad首席执行官阿曼达·理查德森说，技术公司可以通过质疑最近行业范围内转向更严格评估的趋势，让求职者和招聘经理的生活更轻松。她说，要求候选人做更多，最终可能会浪费双方的时间，并排除潜力强大的招聘者。
- en: “You have to be mindful of the bias that can creep into the interview process,”
    says Richardson, whose clients at CoderPad have included Spotify, LinkedIn, and
    Lyft. “If you establish a process that’s a 12-hour take-home test, you are automatically
    filtering out for people who have 12 hours to complete a take-home test. As a
    parent with two kids, that would be hard for me.” It could also exclude some very
    talented coders. CoderPad’s clients are strongly encouraged to limit take-home
    tests to between 90 minutes and two hours as a result.

  zh: “在面试过程中可能会产生的偏见，你必须谨慎对待。”理查德森说。他在CoderPad的客户包括Spotify、LinkedIn和Lyft。“如果你设立了一个需要12小时完成的回家作业测试流程，你自动就在筛选那些有12小时时间完成回家作业测试的人。作为一个有两个孩子的家长，这对我来说是很困难的。”这也可能会排除一些非常有才华的程序员。因此，CoderPad的客户被强烈鼓励将回家作业测试限制在90分钟到两小时之间。
- en: Richardson also encourages hiring and engineering managers to test candidates
    on collaborative problems during live-coding tests, instead of simply observing
    how an engineer is working alone. That helps test what it would be like to actually
    work together if that person joined the company. And rather than ask a candidate
    to build a sample product or solve a problem dreamed up just for the interview,
    Richardson suggests presenting real problems that the company’s internal team
    has already solved. “That way, when the candidate presents an idea, you can fast-forward
    to talking about the complexities of it,” she says.
  id: totrans-split-18

  zh: 理查德森还鼓励招聘和工程经理在现场编码测试中测试候选人的协作问题，而不仅仅是观察工程师独自工作的方式。这有助于测试如果这个人加入公司，实际上一起工作会是什么样子。而不是让候选人构建一个样品产品或解决专门为面试而设想的问题，理查德森建议提出公司内部团队已经解决的真实问题。“这样，当候选人提出一个想法时，你可以快进到讨论它的复杂性，”她说。
- en: Richardson says there has been some uptake of her suggestions, but mostly by
    smaller companies or those outside of the core software business that are still
    jousting for the technical talent—industries like retail, manufacturing, biotech,
    and financial services. Tech interviewing is far from “fixed,” but she thinks
    both job candidates and employers stand to benefit from better practices—ones
    that overcome the “byzantine, onerous interview process, and get the right candidate.”

  zh: 理查德森表示，她的建议已经得到一些公司的采纳，但主要是一些规模较小或核心软件业务之外仍在竞争技术人才的公司，如零售、制造业、生物技术和金融服务等行业。技术面试远未“固定”，但她认为求职者和雇主都有望从更好的实践中受益——这些实践能够克服“费时费力的面试流程”，找到合适的候选人。
