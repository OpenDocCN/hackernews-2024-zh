    must be the offer*, you think, *or at least a step closer to one*. You clear your
    afternoon, make yourself and your space look presentable, and eagerly log into
    Zoom … only to discover you’ve taken all this trouble just so the hiring manager
    can reject you on live video. Now you’ve got to process the bad news while simultaneously
    controlling your face and your tone and ensuring you sound professional—the whole

  zh: 尽管直播视频拒绝听起来像是一种故意的残酷行为，但实际上并非如此。相反，一些招聘经理真诚地认为，在视频通话中拒绝候选人更为礼貌，甚至更为体贴。以下是一位面试官对这一做法写给我的评论：
- en: We do it as a matter of policy. If you make it to the final interview stage,
    HR wants us to reject people by Zoom or at least over the phone. They say it’s
    kinder and doesn’t feel as impersonal after people have invested their time interviewing
    with us. Supposedly we owe them the courtesy of a real conversation. But every
    time I’ve done it, the person sounds crushed. It’s horrible.

- en: I tried not to get too emotionally attached to this position, but the truth
    is I really, really wanted this job. … Finally, I received a video meeting invite
    from the hiring manager. The meeting was titled “quick touch-base” with no agenda
    attached and was scheduled for 15 minutes at the very end of a long day. Since
    I had no idea what to expect, I dressed in a full suit, made sure my hair and
    makeup were on point, and reviewed the job description, my résumé, and cover letter
    again. When we got on camera, the hiring manager said they had some disappointing
    news. They moved forward with another candidate. They were very impressed with
    my skill set and a generic email from HR seemed too impersonal, so they wanted
    to tell me personally and directly.

    While I appreciate his offer of connections, it still really really sucked to
    have to do this all over video call (and then the one connection fizzled out anyway).
    Plus, with an email I can always look back at it when I’m ready, while my mindset

    should be a phone call. I think a lot of people have gotten into the habit of
    making everything a Zoom meeting and they don’t stop to think. If this was a pre-COVID

    emailed me! It was a 30-minute call to tell me that I had been the second-best
    candidate but they went with one with ‘more recent experience,’ and that I ’should
    feel free to apply again if another opportunity opened up!’ I had to sit there
