- en: Google is cracking down on rooted Android devices, blocking multiple people
    from using the RCS message feature in Google Messages. Users with rooted phones
    — a process that unlocks privileged access to the Android operating system, like
    jailbreaking iPhones — have made several reports on the [Google Messages support
    page](https://support.google.com/messages/thread/261416210), [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/androidroot/comments/1b36hij/psa_google_is_quietly_blocking_rcs_on_rooted/),
    and[*XDA*’s web forum](https://xdaforums.com/t/rcs-chat-gone-in-latest-update.4653947/)
    over the last few [months](https://www.reddit.com/r/GoogleMessages/comments/1agsjh0/rcs_issues_on_devices_that_have_unlocked/),
    finding they’re suddenly unable to send or receive RCS messages.

  zh: Google 正在打击已获取 root 权限的 Android 设备，阻止多人在 Google Messages 中使用 RCS 消息功能。已获取 root
    权限的手机用户 — 这是一种解锁 Android 操作系统特权访问的过程，类似于越狱 iPhone — 在过去几个[月份](https://www.reddit.com/r/GoogleMessages/comments/1agsjh0/rcs_issues_on_devices_that_have_unlocked/)中在[Google
    Messages 支持页面](https://support.google.com/messages/thread/261416210)，[Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/androidroot/comments/1b36hij/psa_google_is_quietly_blocking_rcs_on_rooted/)和[*XDA*
    的网上论坛](https://xdaforums.com/t/rcs-chat-gone-in-latest-update.4653947/)上报告说，他们突然不能发送或接收
    RCS 消息。
- en: One example from [Reddit user u/joefuf](https://www.reddit.com/r/GoogleMessages/comments/181a5p9/unable_to_send_rcs_messages/)
    shows that RCS messages would simply vanish after hitting the send button. Several
    reports also mention that Google Messages gave no indication that RCS chat was
    no longer working, and was still showing as connected and working in Google Messages.

    消息在点击发送后会简单消失。几份报告还提到，Google Messages 没有显示 RCS 聊天已经停止工作的迹象，仍然显示为在 Google Messages
    中连接并工作。
- en: In a statement sent to the *Verge* where we asked if Google is blocking rooted
    devices from using RCS, Google communications manager Ivy Hunt said the company
    is “ensuring that message-issuing/receiving devices are following the operating
    measures defined by the RCS standard” in a bid to prevent spam and abuse on Google
    Messages. In other words, yes, Google is blocking RCS on rooted devices.

    sufficiently — and devices that may not have access to one communication protocol
    will always have at least one other available,” said Hunt. “In this case, users
    that are not able to use RCS still have access to SMS & MMS messaging.”

- en: Some services like payment and banking apps, including Google Pay/Wallet, will
    stop working if they detect that users have rooted their device as a security
    measure, but these will typically provide a [warning message](/2012/3/5/2846793/google-wallet-rooted-security-warning)
    to explain the device is unsupported. For users who experienced RCS issues with
    Google Messages, no such warning is apparently provided.

  zh: 一些服务如支付和银行应用，包括 Google Pay/Wallet，在检测到用户已获取 root 权限的设备后会停止工作，作为一种安全措施，但通常会提供一个[警告消息](/2012/3/5/2846793/google-wallet-rooted-security-warning)来解释该设备不受支持。对于在
    Google Messages 遇到 RCS 问题的用户，显然没有提供类似的警告。
