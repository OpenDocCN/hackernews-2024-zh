    walked onstage at the Maverick Concert Hall in Woodstock, NY, to premiere a new
    composition by the American experimental composer [John Cage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Cage)
    (1912–1992). Tudor sat at the piano and opened the keylid, after which he did
    nothing until he closed it over a minute later. He repeated this sequence twice,

- en: How about a “thought experiment,” a kind of “metamusic” that makes a statement
    about music itself? For many people, including me, *4′33″* is certainly that,
    if not only that. One story about Cage recounts his sitting in a restaurant with
    the painter [Willem de Kooning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willem_de_Kooning),
    who, for the sake of argument, placed his fingers in such a way as to frame some
    bread crumbs on the table and said, “If I put a frame around these bread crumbs,
    that isn’t art.” Cage argued that it indeed *was* art, which tells us something
    about *4′33″.* Certainly, through the conventional and well-understood acts of
    placing the title of a composition on a program and arranging the audience in
    chairs facing a pianist, Cage was *framing* the sounds that the audience heard
    in an experimental attempt to make people perceive as art sounds that were not
    usually so perceived.

    de Kooning坐在餐厅里，为了论证，把手指放在桌子上的面包屑周围，说：“如果我在这些面包屑周围加上一个框架，那不算艺术。” Cage认为这确实是艺术，这告诉了我们一些关于《4′33″》的事情。当然，通过在节目上列出作品名称和安排观众坐在椅子上面对钢琴家这样传统和众所周知的做法，Cage试图将观众所听到的声音“框架化”，试图让人们认识到不通常被视为艺术的声音。

- en: Klein’s musical composition, in two movements, is called *Monotone Silence Symphony*.
    In the first movement, an orchestra and choir create “one unique continuous ‘sound,’
    drawn out and deprived of its beginning and of its end.” That sound, a D major
    chord, is held continuously without adornment or variation for twenty minutes.
    The second movement is of equal duration but consists only of the orchestra sitting
    in silence, instructed to remain still and make no movements. Because no singer
    or standard orchestra instrument can hold a note for twenty minutes, to perform
    the piece, the D major is transferred back and forth from one group of paired
    instruments to the other, taking care to make the transition as seamless as possible.
