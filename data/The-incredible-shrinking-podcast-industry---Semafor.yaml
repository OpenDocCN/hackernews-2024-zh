- en: Apple has quietly tightened its reporting of how many people listen to podcasts,
    sending shock waves through an embattled audio industry still reeling from the
    end of the COVID-era production bubble.

  zh: 苹果悄悄收紧了其播客收听人数的报告，这给仍然在从 COVID 时代制作泡沫的声音行业带来了震撼。
- en: 'The shift, Apple wrote in a blog post, was technical: The dominant podcasting
    platform had begun switching off automatic downloads for users who haven’t listened
    to five episodes of a show in the last two weeks.'

  zh: 苹果在一篇博文中写道，这一变化是技术性的：主要的播客平台已经开始关闭那些在过去两周内没有听过五集节目的用户的自动下载。
- en: 'But while few users noticed the shift, some of the biggest podcasts in the
    world saw their official listener numbers drop dramatically. Long-running shows
    that publish frequently were hit particularly hard. A user who listened to a show
    like The New York Times’ *The Daily* a few times, subscribed, but stopped listening
    would continue to count as a download indefinitely. Even better under the old
    rules: For people who listened to a show, dropped off for a while, but started
    listening again later, Apple would automatically download every show in between.
    The arrangement drove big download numbers, a crucial metric for ad sales and
    a sign of the vast reach of podcasts as a medium.'

  zh: 但尽管很少有用户注意到这种变化，一些全球最大的播客节目的官方听众数量却急剧下降。那些经常发布的长期节目受到的影响尤为严重。像是纽约时报的*The Daily*这样的节目，如果用户曾经听过几次、订阅了，但后来停止了听，那么它会一直被计算为下载量。按照旧规则更好的是：对于那些曾经听过某个节目，停止一段时间，但后来又重新开始听的人，苹果将自动下载之间的每个节目。这种安排带来了大量的下载量，这是广告销售的关键指标，也是播客作为一种媒介的广泛影响的标志。
- en: For instance, *The Daily* and *Dateline* both publicly touted reaching over
    *a billion total downloads*. But representatives for these shows would not say
    if those numbers or other impressive daily or weekly download stats are still
    accurate, though several of the biggest podcasts acknowledged privately to Semafor
    that they had seen noticeable declines, and were still trying to determine the
    actual size of their audience following the change.

  zh: 例如，*The Daily*和*Dateline*公开宣称达到了*超过十亿次总下载*。但这些节目的代表没有透露这些数字或其他令人印象深刻的每日或每周下载统计数据是否仍然准确，尽管一些最大的播客节目私下向Semafor承认他们已经看到了明显的下降，并且仍在努力确定他们的受众实际规模。
- en: The shift came with no immediate warning. People who work on audio at The New
    York Times, NPR, and other major publishers told Semafor they were surprised by
    the September change, which had been years in the making but came with no advanced
    warning from Apple. One podcast network told Semafor it had seen its downloads
    drop between single digits and low double digits depending on the show. Another
    well-known podcaster and executive said for some shows, the decline in downloads
    was as high as 40%.

  zh: 这一变化没有提前警告。纽约时报、NPR和其他主要出版商的音频工作人员告诉Semafor，他们对这一九月份的变化感到惊讶，这个变化已经酝酿多年，但苹果没有提前警告。一家播客网络告诉Semafor，他们看到他们的下载量根据节目的不同下降了个位数到两位数不等。另一位知名播客和高管表示，一些节目的下载量下降了高达40%。
