    feeding and an ever-present threat in the time between them. He’d arch his back,
    wailing, his body going rigid with agony, and exorcize a quarter or more of a
    given meal. Every 90 to 120 minutes, we witnessed the most literal rejection of
    a mother’s milk. When we transitioned from breastfeeding to hypoallergenic formula
    (a decidedly modest improvement), I got to share equally in feeding duties, along
    with the profound sense of personal failure in this core parental competency.

    feeding mechanics: Weak oral motor skills, they said, begot swallowing excess
    air during feeding, which triggered reflux.) Hoping to continue breastfeeding,
    Jenni tried an elimination diet of common allergens (including wheat, dairy, soy,
