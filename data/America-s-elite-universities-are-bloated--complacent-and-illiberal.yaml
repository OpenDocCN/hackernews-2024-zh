- en: THE STRUGGLE over America’s elite universities—who controls them and how they
    are run—continues to rage, with lasting consequences for them and the country.
    Harvard faces a congressional investigation into antisemitism; Columbia has just
    been hit with a lawsuit alleging “endemic” hostility towards Jews. Top colleges
    are under mounting pressure to reintroduce rigorous test-based admissions policies,
    after years of backsliding on meritocracy. And it is likely that the cosy tax
    breaks these gilded institutions enjoy will soon attract greater scrutiny. Behind
    all this lies a big question. Can American universities, flabby with cash and
    blighted by groupthink, keep their competitive edge?

  zh: 美国顶尖大学控制权和运营的斗争仍在激烈进行，对双方以及整个国家都将产生深远影响。哈佛大学正面临国会调查，关注其反犹太主义问题；哥伦比亚大学最近遭到指控，声称存在针对犹太人的“普遍”敌意。顶级学院在经历了多年对精英主义的背离后，正面临越来越大的压力，要求恢复以成绩为依据的严格招生政策。同时，“镀金”机构享受到的舒适税减免制度也极有可能面临更多审视。这一切背后，一个重大问题浮出水面：在资金充裕、思想惰性蔓延的美国大学中，能否保持其竞争优势？
- en: The origins of the turmoil lie in extreme campus reactions to Hamas’s attack
    on Israel on October 7th. They led to a blockbuster congressional hearing in December.
    In it politicians accused three college presidents of failing to curtail antisemitism.
    The University of Pennsylvania’s then president, Elizabeth Magill, stepped down
    just days later. Claudine Gay, formerly Harvard’s president, [resigned](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2024/01/03/the-decline-and-fall-of-harvards-president)
    from her job in January amid twin furores over antisemitism on campus and plagiarism
    in her scholarship (which she contested).
