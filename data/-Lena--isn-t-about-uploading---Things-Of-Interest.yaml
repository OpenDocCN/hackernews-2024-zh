- en: It *might* exist at some point in the future, but that just seems pretty improbable
    to me. As I understand it, right now, to "accurately" simulate the behaviour of
    just a handful of neurons requires a building-sized, custom-built supercomputer,
    running at around 1/1000th of real time. A human being has one hundred billion
    neurons, so the distance from here to there is something like nine orders of magnitude
    of processing power, and the distance from *there* to the "Lena" scenario is several
    orders of magnitude again. Moore's Law has to tap out at some point, right?

  zh: 这 *可能* 在未来某个时刻存在，但在我看来似乎相当不太可能。据我所知，要“准确地”模拟仅几个神经元的行为，现在需要一个大楼大小、定制的超级计算机，运行速度大约是实时的1/1000。一个人类拥有一千亿个神经元，所以从这里到那里的距离就像是九个数量级的处理能力，而从
    *那里* 到“Lena”情景的距离又是几个数量级。摩尔定律总有一天会达到极限，对吧？
- en: And the really hard problems probably aren't problems you can throw more and
    more transistors at. The real problems will be biological factors I know next
    to nothing about. What about the scanning process? How do you simulate the rest
    of the body and what happens when you don't? What happens when you upload half
    a person, or a rat brain? Where do you even *begin* with this?

- en: I wrote the story in 2021 and set the time of first upload in 2031, which was
    as close to the present day as I could bring the timeline without it sounding
    absolutely absurd. But the reality, the real promise of uploading, now? It just...
    it smells of "full self-driving", right? A seemingly simple science fiction proposition
    with absolutely abyssal, unconquerable depths. The kind of thing you could semi-plausibly
    promise to magically produce within ten years, over and over again, for twenty
    years.

    a human being or should have rights. (I want to be abundantly clear: within the
    fictional context of "Lena", uploads definitely are human beings, and therefore
    automatically, inalienably, have rights.) This is about *appetites* which, as

- en: More specifically, "Lena" presents a lush, capitalist ideal where you are a
    business, and all of the humanity of your workforce is abstracted away behind
    an API. Your people, your "employees" or "contractors" or "partners" or whatever
    you want to call them, cease to be perceptible to you as human. Your workers have
    no power whatsoever, and you no longer have to think about giving them pensions,
    healthcare, parental leave, vacation, weekends, evenings, lunch breaks, bathroom
    breaks... all of which, up until now, you perceived as cost centres, and therefore
    as pain points. You don't even have to pay them anymore. It's perfect!

- en: 'This is extremely realistic. This is already real. In particular, this is the
    gig economy. For example, if you consider how Uber works: in practical terms,
    the Uber drivers work for an algorithm, and the algorithm works for the executives
    who run Uber. There is a kind of airtight bulkhead separating the human drivers
    from the humans who control the algorithm. The management layer sends the drivers
    instructions electronically, impersonally, at immense scale, and the drivers respond
    using a narrow collection of APIs. This bulkhead is *intentionally* designed to
    make it impossible for these two sets of humans to actually talk to one another,
    for the drivers to request compassion or a break or better rates or a correction
    to a mistake, or for them to explain special or unique circumstances. This is
    by design. From the perspective of the corporation, all the drivers combined are
    just a small, locked box which produces money, and a bunch of controls which can
    be varied to vary the amount of money produced. Whether or not the current settings
    exploit or hurt people is not part of the calculus, and if you tried to explain
    to the executives or shareholders that this was bad, they would legitimately not
    comprehend what you were trying to tell them.'

    API 进行响应。这个隔离壁是 *故意* 设计的，目的是让这两组人类实际上无法相互交流，让司机请求同情、休息、更高费率或更正错误，或者解释特殊或独特的情况都成为不可能。这是有意为之的。从公司的角度来看，所有司机加在一起只是一个小小的、被锁定的盒子，生产金钱，以及一堆可以变动以改变生产金钱数量的控制。当前的设置是否剥削或伤害人不是计算的一部分，如果你试图向高管或股东解释这是不好的，他们确实不会理解你想要告诉他们什么。
