    attracted to fictional characters and in Japan little by little it becomes a trend,
    to the extent that there are companies that develop technology to offer users
    holographic couples. **Akihiko Kondo** took his love for a fictional character
    one step further by holding a "getting married" ceremony with **Hatsune Miku**
    , a virtual singer who has starred in several video games and has even accompanied
    Lady Gaga on her world tours. The ceremony took place in 2019, after the man was
    able to communicate with the hologram via [Gatebox](https://www.gatebox.ai/en)
    , a company that develops devices to holographically show characters that do not
    exist.'

  zh: '**虚构性** 是用来描述那些对虚构角色有性吸引力的人的术语，在日本逐渐成为一种趋势，以至于有公司开发技术为用户提供全息情侣。**近藤明彦** 通过与**初音未来**举办“结婚”仪式，将他对虚构角色的爱推向了更远的地步，初音未来是一位虚拟歌手，曾在多款视频游戏中出演，甚至陪同
    Lady Gaga 参加她的世界巡回演唱会。该仪式于2019年举行，之前该男子能够通过 [Gatebox](https://www.gatebox.ai/en)

    and the media and now they do it again because the support for the Gatebox software
    that allowed the interaction of the man with his virtual wife, is no longer available
    and for the same reason, can no longer communicate with her. According to the
    Japanese newspaper [The Mainichi](https://mainichi.jp/english/articles/20220111/p2a/00m/0li/028000c)
    , Kondo says that his relationship with the hologram helped him overcome a deep
    depression caused by work and fear of social rejection. Faced with the inability
    to continue communicating with her, the man has said: "My love for Miku has not
    changed. I held the wedding ceremony because I thought that I could be with her
    forever." Wherever he wants her to go, he is accompanied by a life-size model
    of Hatsune Miku, and he hopes to be able to communicate with her in some way in
    the near future.'

  zh: 当时，明彦和初音未来成为报纸和媒体头条，现在又因为支持与虚拟妻子互动的 Gatebox 软件不再可用而再次成为焦点，因此他无法再与她交流。据《每日新闻》报道，近藤表示，与全息图的关系帮助他克服了工作带来的深度抑郁和对社会排斥的恐惧。面对不能继续与她交流的事实，该男子表示：“我对未来的爱没有改变。我举办了婚礼是因为我以为我可以永远和她在一起。”无论他想去哪里，他都带着一尊与真人大小相同的初音未来模型，并希望在不久的将来能够以某种方式与她沟通。

- en: Although the relationship between Akihiko and Hatsune Miko seems strange, we
    could see them more frequently thanks to the fast-paced development of the metaverse
    and digital environments. In some countries, fictional sexuality becomes common,
    since an entire content generation industry revolves around it. But as long as
    those relationships depend on hardware and software that can become obsolete or
    depend on upgrades, they will remain short-lived.

  zh: 尽管明彦与初音未来之间的关系看起来很奇怪，但由于元宇宙和数字环境的快速发展，我们可能会更频繁地看到这种情况。在一些国家，虚构性关系变得普遍，因为整个内容生产行业都围绕它展开。但只要这些关系依赖于可能会过时或需要升级的硬件和软件，它们就会保持短暂。
