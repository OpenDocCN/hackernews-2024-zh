    that on joining the team in early 2023, he found its internal processes were a
    disaster. The team's entire car-building process was reportedly so inefficient
    that even when the design was done in good time, disorganized parts management
    meant the 2024 car was just a pile of parts with just three weeks until testing.
    Some of this was down to how Williams kept inventory—in a monster of an Excel
    spreadsheet.
