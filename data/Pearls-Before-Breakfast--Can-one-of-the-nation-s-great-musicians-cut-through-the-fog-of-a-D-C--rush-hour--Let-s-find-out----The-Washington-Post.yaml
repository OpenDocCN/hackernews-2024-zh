    written, but one of the greatest achievements of any man in history. It’s a spiritually

- en: Bell didn’t say it, but Bach’s “Chaconne” is also considered one of the most
    difficult violin pieces to master. Many try; few succeed. It’s exhaustingly long
    -- 14 minutes -- and consists entirely of a single, succinct musical progression
    repeated in dozens of variations to create a dauntingly complex architecture of
    sound. Composed around 1720, on the eve of the European Enlightenment, it is said
    to be a celebration of the breadth of human possibility.

    thoughts and most powerful feelings. If I imagined that I could have created,

    40 多人中，皮卡雷洛是唯一立即提到小提琴家的人。

- en: Picarello knows classical music. He is a fan of Joshua Bell but didn’t recognize
    him; he hadn’t seen a recent photo, and besides, for most of the time Picarello
    was pretty far away. But he knew this was not a run-of-the-mill guy out there,
    performing. On the video, you can see Picarello look around him now and then,
    almost bewildered.

  zh: 皮卡雷洛了解古典音乐。他是约书亚·贝尔的粉丝，但没有认出他；他没有看到最近的照片，而且大部分时间皮卡雷洛离得很远。但他知道这不是一个普通的表演者。在视频上，你可以看到皮卡雷洛不时看看周围，几乎是困惑的表情。

- en: When Picarello was growing up in New York, he studied violin seriously, intending
    to be a concert musician. But he gave it up at 18, when he decided he’d never
    be good enough to make it pay. Life does that to you sometimes. Sometimes, you
    have to do the prudent thing. So he went into another line of work. He’s a supervisor
    at the U.S. Postal Service. Doesn’t play the violin much, anymore.

  zh: 当皮卡雷洛在纽约长大时，他认真学习小提琴，打算成为一名音乐会音乐家。但他在18岁时放弃了，当时他觉得自己永远无法达到足够好的水平。生活有时会这样对待你。有时候，你必须做明智的选择。所以他选择了另一种工作。他是美国邮政服务的主管。他现在不怎么拉小提琴了。
- en: 'When he left, Picarello says, “I humbly threw in $5.” It was humble: You can
    actually see that on the video. Picarello walks up, barely looking at Bell, and
    tosses in the money. Then, as if embarrassed, he quickly walks away from the man
    he once wanted to be.'

    second “Chaconne.” And that also was the first time more than one person at a
    time was listening. As Picarello stood in the back, Janice Olu arrived and took
    up a position a few feet away from Bell. Olu, a public trust officer with HUD,
    also played the violin as a kid. She didn’t know the name of the piece she was
    hearing, but she knew the man playing it has a gift.

  zh: 贝尔认为他在那最后几分钟里做了一天中最好的工作，在第二个“恰孔舞曲”中。那也是第一次有多人同时倾听。当皮卡雷洛站在后面时，珍妮丝·奥鲁赶到，站在贝尔几英尺远的地方。奥鲁是住房和城市发展部的一名公共信托官员，小时候也拉小提琴。她不知道她听到的曲目名字，但她知道弹奏它的人有天赋。

    go, she whispered to the stranger next to her, "I *really* don't want to leave."

    deal with likely outcomes. The most widely held assumption was that there could
    well be a problem with crowd control: In a demographic as sophisticated as Washington,
    the thinking went, several people would surely recognize Bell. Nervous “what-if”
    scenarios abounded. As people gathered, what if others stopped just to see what
    the attraction was? Word would spread through the crowd. Cameras would flash.
    More people flock to the scene; rush-hour pedestrian traffic backs up; tempers
    flare; the National Guard is called; tear gas, rubber bullets, etc.'

  zh: 在准备这个事件时，华盛顿邮报杂志的编辑们讨论了如何处理可能的结果。最普遍的假设是，可能会存在人群控制的问题：在如此复杂的人口统计中，想法是，几个人肯定会认出
    Bell。紧张的“如果”情景充斥着。当人们聚集时，如果其他人停下来看吸引力在哪里？消息会通过人群传播。相机会闪光。更多人涌向现场；高峰时间的行人交通堵塞；情绪激动；国民警卫队被召唤；催泪瓦斯、橡胶子弹等等。
- en: As it happens, exactly one person recognized Bell, and she didn’t arrive until
    near the very end. For Stacy Furukawa, a demographer at the Commerce Department,
    there was no doubt. She doesn’t know much about classical music, but she had been
    in the audience three weeks earlier, at Bell’s free concert at the Library of
    Congress. And here he was, the international virtuoso, sawing away, begging for
    money. She had no idea what the heck was going on, but whatever it was, she wasn’t
    about to miss it.
