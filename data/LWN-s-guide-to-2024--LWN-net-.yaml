    we do not have a better idea of what this year will bring than anybody else does,
    but that doesn't keep us from going out on a shaky limb and making predictions
    anyway. Here, for the curious, are a few things that we think may be in store
    for 2024.

- en: '**The kernel community will begin to move away from email** as the core of
    its development process. Progress will be slow, and many kernel developers will
    prove strongly resistant to any alternative workflow, often for good reasons,
    but there will be at least a few developers who are able to get work reviewed,
    updated, and merged without having to touch a mail client. In a world where even
    Linus Torvalds is [saying](/Articles/952034/) that the time has come to make a
    change, the unthinkable stands a good chance of actually coming to pass.'

    Linus Torvalds 都在[说](/Articles/952034/)是时候做出改变的世界里，令人难以置信的事情有很大可能会真的发生。'
- en: '**The next long-term stable kernel will be 6.12**, which will be released on
    December 1, 2024 (unless Linus Torvalds declines to make a release immediately
    after the US Thanksgiving holiday, in which case it will be one week later).'

- en: '**The first user-visible Rust code** will be merged into the kernel, perhaps
    as soon as the 6.8 release (which will happen in March). That code may not be
    used on many systems initially, but it still marks an important transition: once
    Rust is used for user-visible features, the kernel community will no longer have
    the option of easily dropping support for the language. Merging user-visible Rust
    code into the kernel will, in other words, be a declaration that the Rust experiment
    is a success.'

  zh: '**第一个对用户可见的 Rust 代码**将合并到内核中，可能会在 6.8 版本中实现（该版本将于三月发布）。最初该代码可能不会在许多系统上使用，但这仍标志着一个重要的转变：一旦
    Rust 用于用户可见特性，内核社区将不再有轻易放弃对该语言支持的选择。换句话说，将用户可见的 Rust 代码合并到内核中将宣告 Rust 实验的成功。'
- en: As Rust becomes necessary to build a Linux kernel, **the lack of a GCC-based
    Rust compiler will become a bigger problem**. The [gccrs project](/Articles/954787/)
    is working to fill that void, but the task is large, the target is moving quickly,
    and the project has progressed slowly with relatively little support. Somebody
    is going to have to put some resources into that project if it is to succeed;
    it is not clear where those resources might come from in 2024, though.

    2024 年这些资源可能会来自何处尚不清楚。
- en: '**The enterprise distribution market will be shaken up** in 2024\. Last year,
    vendors working in this space all apparently came to the conclusion that there
    was little to be done other than offering clones of Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL),
    essentially ceding control over that part of the market to one company. As Red
    Hat makes it harder to compete in that space, though, both vendors and users will
    increasingly ask themselves why they are bothering. Stable Linux does not need
    to be a copy of RHEL, and there are a number of interesting approaches that could
    draw parts of the market away from RHEL in the future.'

    Red Hat 在这个领域竞争日益激烈，供应商和用户都将越来越问自己为什么还要费心。稳定的 Linux 不需要是 RHEL 的副本，未来可能有许多有趣的方法可以将市场的一部分吸引离开
    RHEL。'

    a strong impetus from Google''s [plan to switch to "Manifest V3"](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/resuming-the-transition-to-mv3/)

    that makes the World Wide Web tolerable for many users. Switching browsers is

- en: Of course, this will all go better if Mozilla positions itself well to be the
    defender of a friendlier web. The recent [statement from Mozilla CEO Mitchell
    Baker](https://stateof.mozilla.org/#build-better) suggests that the organization
    sees AI as a more interesting place to focus its efforts on than saving the world
    (again) from a browser monopoly. If Firefox languishes while Mozilla pursues shinier
    projects, an opportunity — perhaps the final one — for Firefox to regain relevance
    may be lost.

    重新恢复相关性的机会——也许是最后一次机会——可能会丧失。
- en: Speaking of AI, **open-source generative AI will see a lot of attention this
    year**. Partly that is because some of the open-source projects have proved to
    be surprisingly competitive with the proprietary efforts, but there is more going
    on than that. Those proprietary platforms are going to spend the year tangled
    up in high-profile copyright lawsuits and could run into serious trouble. A system
    based on free software, running on one's own servers, may continue to be useful
    even if the large, proprietary solutions find themselves restricted or shut down.
    We will also certainly see signs of open-source models being used in ways (such
    as the generation of hate speech, for example) that the commercial models, often
    with good reason, prohibit. The results seem unlikely to be pleasant.

    years have been as well. Projects like [the extensible scheduler class](/Articles/922405/)

    its rejection to be reconsidered. Meanwhile, the recently announced [acquisition
    of Isovalent](https://isovalent.com/blog/post/cisco-acquires-isovalent/) by Cisco
    may bring new resources to BPF development — or it may, in the way of many corporate

- en: '**The first release of a "free threading" Python** (without the global interpreter
    lock or GIL) in October will be a qualified success. There will be rough spots
    and bumpy patches due to the need for two different binary distributions of the
    language (with and without the GIL) and its extensions, but the overall direction
    will be looking good. The free-threaded version will not be the default in 2024,
    but progress in that direction will be visible by the end of the year.'

    increase. We will have to develop better defenses to avoid being overwhelmed by

- en: Finally, **the ongoing maintainer crisis will intensify** in 2024. There are

    upon, but which receive little support. Those projects, as a result, tend to exhibit

- en: Free software has been a major boon to the corporate world. Any company out
    there can take advantage of massive amounts of free software with no obligations
    beyond adhering to the license — and many companies do not even bother with that.
    Companies can adapt the software to their needs, and they can pool their efforts
    to minimize the need to reimplement functionality that has been created elsewhere.

  zh: 自由软件对企业界带来了重大利好。任何公司都可以利用大量的自由软件，而不需要履行除了遵守许可证之外的任何义务 —— 许多公司甚至都不会费心去做到这一点。公司可以根据自己的需求调整软件，并且他们可以集中精力，以最小化在其他地方创建的功能的需要重新实现。
- en: This freedom is a good thing; it has created a great deal of benefit for almost
    everybody involved. But free software does not develop itself; it needs care and
    support. Often, companies have provided those resources, with the result that
    we all have access to far more free software than we might have once thought possible.
    We have all benefited from this massive contribution of resources to our community
    from the commercial realm.

  zh: 这种自由是一件好事；它为几乎所有参与者带来了巨大的利益。但自由软件并不会自己发展；它需要关怀和支持。通常情况下，公司提供了这些资源，结果我们都能够接触到比我们曾经想象可能的自由软件要多得多。我们都从商业领域对我们社区的这一巨大贡献中受益。
- en: But companies can be severely short-sighted. It is easy for a manager to justify
    contributing a driver to the kernel to enable their company's hardware. It is
    harder to justify contributing resources to the framework within the kernel that
    makes the driver easy to write, to the rest of the kernel, or to user-space support
    for that hardware. And it is nearly impossible to get resources to support hardware
    that the company is no longer selling — even though many users still depend on
    that hardware.
  id: totrans-25

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 但公司可能非常短视。经理很容易为向内核贡献一个驱动程序以启用公司的硬件而辩解。但要为使驱动程序编写起来更容易的内核框架、内核的其余部分或者该硬件的用户空间支持贡献资源就难了。甚至很难获得支持公司已不再销售的硬件的资源——尽管许多用户仍然依赖于那些硬件。
- en: So companies tend to contribute in ways that create other problems and fail
    to support the platform as a whole. They hire maintainers in the hope of gaining
    both skills and some influence over a project, then do not give those maintainers
    time to do their maintenance work. Companies will often ignore pressing needs
    in parts of the free-software ecosystem, seeing them as somebody else's problem.
    As a result, much of the work of keeping our software healthy falls onto the shoulders
    of the relatively few developers who are able to put some time (perhaps at significant
    personal cost) into it.
  id: totrans-26
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 所以公司倾向于以导致其他问题并未能支持整个平台的方式做出贡献。他们雇佣维护者，希望获得技能和对项目的一些影响，然后不给这些维护者时间来做他们的维护工作。公司通常会忽视自由软件生态系统中某些部分的紧迫需求，把它们看作是别人的问题。因此，保持我们软件健康的工作很大程度上落在相对较少的能够抽出一些时间（也许是付出相当大的个人代价）的开发者的肩上。
- en: By all appearances, 2024 does not look like a year in which companies have decided
    to improve support for the software that they depend so heavily upon. That needs
    to change; free software is not some magical, infinite resource that companies
    can use to reduce their own development costs without a care for its future. It
    is a way to share maintenance costs; if it is used as a way to shed those costs
    entirely, the results will continue to be unpleasant, for both the software and
    the people who work so hard to keep it going.

  zh: 从表面上看，2024年似乎不像是公司已经决定改善他们如此严重依赖的软件的支持的一年。这种情况需要改变；自由软件不是一种公司可以毫无顾忌地使用以降低他们自己的开发成本的神奇、无限的资源。它是一种分享维护成本的方式；如果它被用来完全摆脱这些成本，结果将继续令人不快，对于软件以及那些努力使其运行的人们来说都是如此。
