- en: Chris Dixon, who leads the [A16Z crypto fund](https://a16zcrypto.com/), and
    has been an entrepreneur, VC, and friend of mine for over twenty years, has written
    a book called [Read Write Own](https://readwriteown.com/) that is available for
    pre-order now and will start shipping at the end of the month. Chris gave me a
    copy right before the holidays and I read it over the last week.

  zh: 克里斯·迪克森（Chris Dixon）领导着[A16Z加密基金](https://a16zcrypto.com/)，他已经是一位企业家、风险投资人，也是我的朋友已经二十多年了，他写了一本名为[《阅读、写作、拥有》](https://readwriteown.com/)的书，现在可以预定，月底开始发货。克里斯在节假日期间给了我一本复印本，我在过去的一周里读了它。
- en: I asked Chris why he wrote the book and he had two answers, one personal and
    one practical. The personal one is “I have focused my career on investing in blockchain
    networks. During the recent downturn, I felt a need to rearticulate to myself
    why I am doing that.”  The practical one is “I want to explain blockchain networks
    to young adults who are thinking about where to start their careers, to the mother
    of the software engineer at Coinbase who wants to understand what her child is
    working on, and to lawmakers and regulators in DC who need to understand why they
    are important.”

  zh: 我问克里斯为什么写这本书，他有两个答案，一个是个人的，一个是实际的。个人的是“我把我的职业重心放在投资区块链网络上。在最近的经济衰退期间，我感到有必要重新对自己解释为什么我要这样做。”
    实际的是“我想向思考从哪里开始自己职业的年轻人解释区块链网络，向在Coinbase工作的软件工程师的母亲解释她的孩子在做什么，向华盛顿的立法者和监管者解释为什么它们重要。”
- en: What Chris calls Blockchain Networks, I call Web3\. The term Web3 is important
    to me because my investing career first took meaning during the initial phase
    of the web, which I think of as Web1\. It took off during the second phase of
    my career which many call Web2\. And I’ve spent the last decade of my career imagining
    what a better version could be, which I call Web3.

  zh: 克里斯称之为区块链网络，我称之为Web3。对我来说，Web3这个术语很重要，因为我的投资生涯最初是在网页的初始阶段赋予意义的，我把这个阶段称为Web1。它在我职业生涯的第二阶段起飞，很多人称之为Web2。而在过去的十年里，我一直在想象一个更好的版本可能是什么，我称之为Web3。
- en: Chris takes the same journey but he calls these phases Read, Write, and Own.
    The initial phase of the web, when the web browser arrived, was mostly a reading
    experience. Then in the early 2000s, the web became two-way and we could Read
    and Write. What Blockchain Networks have unlocked is the ability to own things
    on the web. You can own your identity. You can own your social media posts. You
    can own your money. You can own your art. You can own your music. And so on and
    so forth.

  zh: 克里斯走了同样的旅程，但他把这些阶段称为阅读、写作和拥有。在网页浏览器到来时，网页的初始阶段主要是阅读体验。然后在21世纪初，网络变成了双向的，我们可以阅读和写作。区块链网络所解锁的是在网页上拥有事物的能力。你可以拥有你的身份。你可以拥有你的社交媒体帖子。你可以拥有你的钱。你可以拥有你的艺术品。你可以拥有你的音乐。等等等等。
- en: Chris’s book has three parts. The first part is a history of the web and how
    we got to where we are right now. The second part is a detailed description of
    what makes Blockchain Networks work and why they are important and powerful. The
    third and final part is a series of descriptions of new kinds of applications
    that are being built on Blockchain Networks.

  zh: 克里斯的书分为三个部分。第一部分是关于网页的历史以及我们是如何走到现在的。第二部分是对区块链网络的工作原理及其重要性和强大性的详细描述。第三部分是对正在区块链网络上构建的新型应用程序的一系列描述。
- en: While I enjoyed all three parts of the book, I was energized by the final section.
    Chris imagines a future that is very different from where we are today. It is
    one I very much want to see emerge. I think you will too.

  zh: 虽然我喜欢这本书的所有三个部分，但最后一部分让我充满活力。克里斯想象了一个与今天完全不同的未来。这是我非常想看到的一个未来。我认为你也会。
- en: You can pre-order Read Write Own [here](https://readwriteown.com/).I encourage
    you to do that. I expect you will turn that last page and be excited, like I am,
    about what is coming now that we can own the Internet instead of it owning us.
