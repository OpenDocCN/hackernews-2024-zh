    thing. [[1]](https://www.gallup.com/workplace/236213/why-need-best-friends-work.aspx)
    It might not be. Recent studies have shown that relationships with co-workers
    are now one of the least important factors in job satisfaction. [[](#_ftn1)[2](#_ftn2)[]](https://www.capterra.com/resources/friends-at-work-research/)
    On top of that, making friends at work often keeps us from what is really important—building
    a network of co-workers that brings value, staying away from the day-to-day drama
    that can be significant, and finally making clear delineations between real friends
    and co-workers.
