    How could a new furnace “know” that it had just been connected to a 20-year-old
    air conditioner (from a competing brand), somehow read that unit’s cooling capacity,
    and then calibrate its own output to the precisely required airflow? In a bid
    to reconcile the reading on my manometer with the tech’s supposed savvy, I asked

  zh: 更好的技术可以提供重叠的质量控制系统和终端用户保护，但这些技术在承包商中的接受度较低。还记得那个设置错误的风扇吗？制造商确实拥有称为“通讯控制器”的先进恒温器，能够识别它们连接的同品牌设备，并可以自动选择正确的空气流量。虽然它们并非完美，但比普遍存在的错误空气流量要好得多。但是，由于价格超过1000美元，它们很少销售，因为它们被视为奢侈品而非错误避免工具。并且由于它们主要向技术人员而非终端用户传达信息，我们最终处于一个暖通空调承包商主要充当设备销售人员的境地，这些设备旨在保护客户免受自身无能的影响。这是一个难以推广的销售。

- en: In order to fix these problems, occupants need clear, verifiable information
    about how their HVAC systems work. The more complex and opaque a system is, the
    more likely it is that technicians will make mistakes in installing and repairing
    it — and the easier it is for them to lie. Measuring airflow might seem like a
    simple task for an HVAC technician, but in fact it’s widely misunderstood. Most
    technicians won’t have the training or tools to quantify airflow. And in an industry
    in which technicians and managers routinely lie, asking whether an individual
    or company can perform a task has the potential to select for lying instead of
    competence.

  zh: 为了解决这些问题，居住者需要清晰、可验证的关于他们的暖通空调系统如何运作的信息。系统越复杂、越不透明，技术人员在安装和维修过程中出错的可能性就越大，也越容易撒谎。测量空气流量对于暖通空调技术人员来说可能是一个简单的任务，但实际上它被广泛误解。大多数技术人员没有培训或工具来量化空气流量。在一个技术人员和经理们经常说谎的行业中，询问个人或公司是否能完成一个任务往往可能导致选择说谎而非能力。
- en: 'In the absence of industry wide norms change and regulation, there are interventions
    that can put objective metrics into the hands of end users — and thereby create
    feedback loops that create consumer checks on the industry. Imagine the gas mileage
    in your car abruptly plummets. You may not be able to diagnose the issue, but
    you’ll have immediate feedback over whether the mechanic has actually fixed the
    problem the next time you drive. These proposals won’t be enough to better regulate
    the HVAC industry on their own: People need to use them, and agencies and unions
    will need to adopt or support them in some form, but they represent a first step.'

  zh: 在行业缺乏统一规范变更和监管的情况下，可以采取介入措施将客观指标交到终端用户手中，从而创建消费者对行业的反馈循环。想象一下，你的汽车突然油耗骤降。你可能无法诊断问题，但下次开车时，你会立即知道技师是否真的修好了问题。这些提案本身不足以单独更好地监管暖通空调行业：人们需要使用它们，机构和工会需要在某种形式上采纳或支持它们，但它们代表了第一步。
- en: The first is the use of carbon dioxide monitors as a proxy for indoor air quality
    generally, and respiratory virus transmission risk in particular. The risk of
    infection within indoor settings scales with excess CO2, and in a room with inadequate
    ventilation, CO2 increases over time. Public monitors can thereby work as proxies
    for adequate ventilation systems, and is an effective way to monitor the safety
    of rooms over time, as well as to diagnose room-to-room variations in air quality.

  zh: 第一种方法是使用二氧化碳监测仪作为室内空气质量的代理，特别是呼吸道病毒传播风险。在室内环境中，感染风险随着二氧化碳的过量而增加，在通风不良的房间里，二氧化碳会随着时间的推移而增加。公共监测器因此可以作为充分通风系统的代理，并且是随时间监测房间安全性的有效方式，以及诊断空气质量在房间之间的变化。
- en: While handheld CO2 monitors have become somewhat widespread, to date visible
    public displays have gained very little traction. In part, this is because it’s
    difficult to figure out what CO2 level to target in rooms with both ventilation
    and air filters — as filters can provide sufficient protection where adequate
    ventilation isn’t possible. This could probably be addressed by clearly labeling
    the clean air delivery rate of standalone filters in a room. Standalone filters
    are superior to central ones because laypeople aren’t readily able to verify central
    system filtration rates. However, with improvements to the display of clean air
    delivery rate on freestanding filters, it would be fairly simple for a sophisticated
    layperson to roughly calculate the filtered air exchanges.

  zh: 尽管手持式二氧化碳监测器已经有些普及，但到目前为止，可见的公共显示几乎没有得到推广。部分原因是在既有通风又有空气过滤器的房间中很难确定何种二氧化碳水平是目标——因为过滤器可以在无法进行充分通风的情况下提供足够的保护。通过清晰标记独立过滤器在房间内的净化空气送风率，可能可以解决这个问题。独立过滤器优于中央过滤器，因为普通人不容易验证中央系统的过滤率。然而，通过改进独立过滤器上的清洁空气送风率显示，复杂的普通人大致计算过滤空气交换将变得相对简单。
- en: We also need ways to improve the transparency of necessary HVAC work. Technicians
    should geotag pictures of measured performance and diagnostics, and these should
    be publicly available, either on a company’s website or — if regulation were to
    go so far — some sort of public repository. Claims regarding equipment parameters
    and limitations should include geotagged photos of nameplates and highlighted
    sections from installation manuals. Only a small number of contractors currently
