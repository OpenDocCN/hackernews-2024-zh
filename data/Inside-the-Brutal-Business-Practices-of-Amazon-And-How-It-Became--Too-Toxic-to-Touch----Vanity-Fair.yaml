- en: In May of 2020, seven members of the House Judiciary Antitrust Subcommittee
    penned a letter to then CEO of Amazon **Jeff Bezos.** “On April 23,” their message
    began, *The Wall Street Journal* “reported that Amazon employees used sensitive
    business information from third-party sellers on its platform to develop competing
    products.” The article contradicted previous sworn testimony from the company’s
    general counsel, possibly rendering the testimony “false or perjurious,” the seven
    congressional leaders wrote.

  zh: 2020年5月，众议院司法反垄断小组委员会的七名成员致信时任亚马逊CEO **杰夫·贝佐斯**。他们的信件开头是：“4月23日，《华尔街日报》报道称，亚马逊员工利用其平台上第三方卖家的敏感业务信息开发竞争产品。”
    这篇文章与公司总法律顾问此前作出的宣誓证词相矛盾，可能使证词“虚假或伪证”，七位国会领导人写道。
- en: The *Journal*’s exposé, which ultimately spurred Bezos’s first-ever congressional
    testimony, was written by **Dana Mattioli** as part of the paper’s wide-ranging
    investigation into Amazon’s business practices. At the time, Mattioli, a longtime
    business reporter, had recently moved into the Amazon beat, her interest piqued
    by the corporation’s tentacular infiltration of nearly every aspect of American
    economic life. Now, four years later, she’s out with *[The Everything War](https://www.amazon.com/Everything-War-Dana-Mattioli/dp/0316269778),*
    a new book-length examination of Amazon that explores everything from its rise
    to power to its lobbying efforts and the brewing backlash against it.

  zh: 《*华尔街日报*》的曝光报道最终促使贝佐斯首次在国会作证，该报道是由长期从事商业报道的**达娜·马蒂奥利**撰写的，作为该报对亚马逊业务实践广泛调查的一部分。当时，马蒂奥利刚刚转向亚马逊报道，她被这家公司几乎渗透到美国经济生活的各个方面所吸引。现在，四年过去了，她推出了名为*[《全面战争》](https://www.amazon.com/Everything-War-Dana-Mattioli/dp/0316269778)*的新书，详细探讨了亚马逊从崛起到权力扩张以及对其的反击。
- en: In this interview with *Vanity Fair,* edited for length and clarity, Mattioli
    and I spoke about the challenges of reporting on an infamously secretive and combative
    company, Amazon’s forays into political-influence peddling, its new foe in the
    Biden administration, and which candidate she thinks Amazon execs want to see
    back in the White House come January 2025.

    reporter for six years, and in that role, my job was to cover which companies
    are buying other companies across industries globally. Something fascinating happened
    during my tenure in that role. It wasn’t just retail companies that were nervous
    about Amazon. I’d speak to the bankers, the lawyers, the CEOs, the board members
    at different companies, and they started talking about how they were worried about
    Amazon invading their industry. Over the course of those six years, those questions
    got louder. It started bleeding into other sectors where you wouldn’t even really
    think about Amazon at the time. The company seemed to stretch into every vertical
    and its tentacles kept spreading. It occurred to me that this was the most interesting
    company, but also one of the most secretive companies in business history. That
    to me seemed like such a fun challenge to dig in and see what was going on behind
    the scenes.'

- en: I would say that, as it relates to me, they didn’t provide access, but that
    doesn't mean I didn’t get access. I spoke to 17 S-team members—the most senior
    people at the company—for this book, without the company knowing. I spoke to hundreds
    of people in and around the company. I had hundreds of pages of internal documents.
    They didn’t really cooperate for the book in setting up interviews, and I understand
    why. Some of my investigations at the *Journal* had been very hard-hitting. One
    of them was the basis for Jeff Bezos’s being called to testify to Congress for
    the first time in his career. So they didn't participate on an official basis,
    but I of course did a full fact-check. Out of fairness, I incorporate their PR
    statements and rebuttals very generously throughout. But it is an interesting
    company from a PR standpoint. There was an [investigation from *Mother Jones*](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2021/06/amazon-journalists-pr-tactics/)
    about the company bullying reporters, how they have lied to reporters in the past,
    and how that makes things difficult for reporters trying to cover the company.
    And that investigation questions whether that’s a tactic to get people to back
    off and not even want to cover them in the first place.

  zh: 关于我个人来说，我会说他们没有提供访问权限，但这并不意味着我没有得到访问。为了写这本书，我私下与公司的17位S级成员——即该公司的最高级人员——进行了交谈，而公司并不知情。我与公司内外的数百人进行了交谈。我拥有数百页的内部文件。他们在为这本书设置采访时并没有真正合作，我理解为什么。我在《华尔街日报》做的一些调查非常深入。其中一项调查是导致杰夫·贝索斯首次在其职业生涯中被召唤到国会作证的基础。因此，他们并没有以官方身份参与，但我当然进行了全面的事实核查。出于公平起见，我在整本书中非常慷慨地援引了他们的公关声明和反驳。但从公关的角度看，这是一家有趣的公司。《母亲琼斯》进行了一项调查，探讨了该公司如何欺凌记者，他们过去如何对记者撒谎，以及这种做法如何使试图报道该公司的记者们陷入困境。那项调查质疑这是否是一种策略，让人们望而却步，甚至不愿首次报道他们。

    turnover and the burnout is much higher than at most other companies. People tend
    not to last, because it’s very aggressive and it can be bruising. As a result
    of that, a lot of people have come to me—both people still there and people that

  zh: 亚马逊是我曾报道过的最有趣的公司文化，也是最具攻击性的公司。这是一家巨大的公司。超过一百万人在那里工作。人员流动率和职业倦怠远高于大多数其他公司。人们倾向于不能长久待在那里，因为这里非常激进，可能会让人受伤。因此，许多人向我透露他们的经历——既有仍在公司的人，也有已经离开的人。
- en: When I delve into what goes on behind the scenes and the anticompetitive business
    behaviors that make Amazon win so often, a lot of it is the product of this culture.
    A lot of the shocking behaviors are because of this company’s culture. If you’re
    auditioning for your job every day, and you’re auditioning against every other
    brilliant employee there, and you know that at the end of the year, 6% of you
    are going to get cut no matter what, and at the same time, you have access to
    unrivaled data on partners, sellers, and competitors, you might be tempted to
    look at that data to get an edge and keep your job and get to your restricted
    stock units. If you’re at [Amazon] and you’re meeting with [outside companies]
    on the dealmaking side or the Alexa venture capital side, you might be tempted

  zh: 当我深入探究幕后发生的事情以及使亚马逊频频获胜的反竞争行为时，这很大程度上是这种文化的产物。许多令人震惊的行为都是因为这家公司的文化。如果你每天都在为你的工作面试，并且你与每位其他杰出员工竞争，你知道每年最终会有6%的人员被裁减，与此同时，你可以获取无与伦比的合作伙伴、卖家和竞争对手的数据，你可能会受到诱惑去查看这些数据，以获取优势，保住工作并获得你的限制性股票单位。如果你在[亚马逊]，并且你在与[外部公司]进行交易或Alexa风险投资方面会面时，你可能会受到诱惑，不忘记在这些会议中学到的内容，并将其用于一个产品，以取得成功。
