    has it or they don’t -- in which case, too bad, they’re doomed to a life in the
    minor leagues. This hasn’t been my experience. Over the years, as I’ve gradually
    grown dumber relative to my peers through a combination of aging and making smarter
    friends, one of the main ways I’ve compensated has been through dialing up my
    agency, which I think of as something like “manifest determination to make things
    happen.”'

- en: The idea of finding real edges, as contrasted with “eking out wins by grinding
    harder than everyone,” first clicked for me when I started playing poker. Poker
    in the modern era is an extraordinarily competitive game, and even 8 years ago
    pros were spending nearly as much time studying as they were playing, using solver
    models to seek out tiny mathematical advantages. At the same time, a massive edge
    was available in the form of physical reads, but almost entirely ignored. (I know

    results. But when we’d tell other pros what we were doing, the response from most
