    probably a minimal effect on businesses when you put in a bike lane,” Poirer says.
    “That actually makes a lot of sense. If you think of a busy downtown district,
    there’s not that many parking spaces relative to the number of people who come

    Poirer说道。“这其实很有道理。如果你考虑一个繁忙的市中心区域，相对于来店的人数，停车位并不多。”在这种情况下，自行车道似乎并没有对商业有太大帮助。但总体而言，它们并没有带来负面影响。

    to two kinds of bike infrastructure — Class II, which creates dedicated bike lanes
    denoted by a paint stripe, and Class III, where signs instruct cars and bikes
    to share the street. (Either way, blocks with the new lanes lost an average of
    three parking spaces.) Once again, the results were mixed. On Class II lanes,
    bars and barber shops and banks enjoyed increases in sales, while furniture stores
    and gas stations were more likely to experience decreases. Older businesses tended
    to decline more than new ones. Overall, in the year after the bike infrastructure
    went in, businesses on Class II streets lost a median of $27,921 compared with
    $19,390 for those on Class III lanes. But similar shops that weren’t on a bike

  zh: 现在，倡导者和政策制定者应该对这一切保持诚实。即使自行车道整体提升了收入和就业，一些个体企业将会受益，但一些企业将会受损。销售较重货物或从更广泛的流域汲取客户群的老企业可能会陷入困境。“对于周围密度和发展感到高兴的新型企业正在转向年轻的顾客，他们会骑滑板车或自行车到达。”城市规划咨询公司Streetsense的董事总经理Larisa
    Ortiz说。“但是这种向自行车道和移动性演变的过程并非没有损失。”

    urban landscape is the most American solution of all: Just hand them some money.
    All you’d have to do is build funds into the budgets for street-improvement projects
    to compensate adjacent businesses for any sales they wind up losing. If your business
    takes a hit from all the bikes, you get a pay-out.'

  zh: 我建议帮助企业适应城市风景完全改变的最美国解决方案是：直接给他们一些钱。你需要做的就是在街道改善项目的预算中设立资金，以补偿邻近企业可能损失的销售额。如果你的生意因为所有的自行车而受损，你会得到一笔赔偿。
- en: The most effective way to deal with opposition from local businesses is to just
    get the bike lanes built. Before-and-after surveys tend to show that in the long
    run, everyone winds up satisfied. “It’s a political question, and oftentimes it’s
    a very divided community when it comes to these types of projects,” Poirier says.
    “But once a street is changed, generally speaking, after six months or a year,
    nobody remembers what it used to look like. It’s the new normal.” All the data
    in the world may prove that bike lanes are good for business. But nothing beats
    experiencing them.

  zh: 处理地方企业反对的最有效方法就是让自行车道建起来。长期来看，傍晚调查往往显示每个人最终都会满意。“这是一个政治问题，往往在这些项目涉及时社区意见分裂。”Poirier说。“但改变了一条街道后，一般来说，经过六个月或一年，没有人记得它之前是什么样子的。这就是新的常态。”世界上的所有数据都可能证明自行车道对生意有好处。但没有什么能比亲身感受更好。
