- en: The wealth that can be gained from helping to propel a successful company is
    vividly illustrated by a recent Tweet/X by Barron’s writer [Tae Kim](https://twitter.com/firstadopter/status/1778536699221672052).
    One “mid-level” Nvidia employee accrued a fortune of $62 million, claims Kim.
    Thus, company share schemes can be a great incentive for employees. However, as
    a counterpoint, the senior Barron’s reporter also knows of at least one Nvidia
    employee who made a “half billion dollar mistake,” after their ‘green-gold’ slipped
    through their fingers.

  zh: 一条最近的[Tae Kim](https://twitter.com/firstadopter/status/1778536699221672052)的巴伦财经作家推文生动地说明了通过帮助推动一家成功公司而获得的财富。据金称，一位"中层"英伟达员工积累了6200万美元的财富。因此，公司股票计划可以成为员工的巨大激励。然而，作为对比，这位资深巴伦记者也知道至少有一位英伟达员工，在他们的"绿色黄金"从手中溜走后犯了一个"50亿美元的错误"。
- en: In the Tweet above, Kim tells the happy tale of a mid-level Nvidia employee
    who “maxed out the employee stock purchase plan (ESPP) for 18 years,” and kept
    a firm hold of this ‘green gold.’ The employee wasn’t a big shot engineer, it
    is made clear. They simply took full advantage of the Nvidia ESPP, which allows
    employees to use between 10-15% of their salary to buy company stock at a 15%
    discount to the market.

  zh: 在上面的推文中，金讲述了一位"中层"英伟达员工的幸福故事，他"在18年间超额购买了员工股票购买计划（ESPP），"并且紧握着这份"绿色金矿"。清楚明白的是，这个员工并不是大人物工程师。他们只是充分利用了英伟达ESPP，允许员工使用工资的10-15%来以15%的折扣购买公司股票。
- en: This lucky (wise?) employee is said to have left Nvidia with a stack of shares
    worth $62 million. It must have been hard to hold these shares without sometimes
    dipping in to take some cash, but Kim asserts that this individual “never sold
    during tenure.” We don’t need to say that $62 million is a considerable retirement
    nest egg, and hope that the ex-employee enjoys the best of health, too.

  zh: 据说这位幸运（明智？）的员工离开Nvidia时手中有价值6200万美元的股票。在某些时候不去抛售这些股票一定很难，但金先生断言这个人"在任职期间从未出售过"。我们毋需多言，6200万美元是一笔可观的退休基金，希望这位前雇员也能享受最佳健康。
- en: As teased in the intro, not everyone who took advantage of the Nvidia ESPP during
    the rocket-propelled share valuation gains of recent years fared so well. Kim
    tells of an early Nvidia employee, an engineer, who once was the proud owner of
    a million Nvidia shares (a single share is valued at $882 at the time of writing).

  zh: 正如前言中所揭示的，不是每一位在最近几年火箭般上升的股票价值中利用英伟达ESPP的人都有好运。金讲述了英伟达早期员工的故事，一位工程师，曾经是一百万股英伟达的骄傲拥有者（在撰写时，每股价值882美元）。
- en: Sadly, this employee had to sell up his green gold to pay for losses when his
    broker “margined his account with another stock that fell 90%,” [explains Kim](https://twitter.com/firstadopter/status/1778553658751226100).
    A margin account is where you leverage the value of one or more holdings to purchase
    other stocks or financial assets. In this instance, the forced sell from the margin
    account led to a “half billion dollar mistake” according to the source.

  zh: 不幸的是，这位员工不得不抛售他的"绿色黄金"来弥补损失，因为他的经纪人"用另一只股票对他的账户进行了杠杆交易，而该股票下跌了90%"，[金解释说](https://twitter.com/firstadopter/status/1778553658751226100)。杠杆账户是你利用一项或多项持有物的价值来购买其他股票或金融资产。在这种情况下，因迫使从杠杆账户卖出，导致了"50亿美元的错误"，根据消息来源说。

    and their fortunes. Last November, we wrote about a lesser-known Nvidia co-founder,
    [Curtis Priem](https://www.tomshardware.com/news/nvidia-co-founder-lives-off-grid-but-could-have-been-worth-70-billion)
    (the first Nvidia CFO), who cashed out relatively early. Interestingly Priem’s
    Nvidia stock would have been worth over $70 billion if he had held onto it. However,
    this ‘loss’ seems to be of no concern to Priem, who has an estimated $30 million
    personal fortune and what sounds like a busy, fulfilling life.

  zh: 这不是我们第一次听说，或者报道了Nvidia员工及其财富。去年十一月，我们曾写过一篇关于较为不知名的Nvidia联合创始人[Curtis Priem](https://www.tomshardware.com/news/nvidia-co-founder-lives-off-grid-but-could-have-been-worth-70-billion)（首任Nvidia
    CFO），他相对较早地出售了股票。有趣的是，如果Priem继续持有，他的Nvidia股票现在可能价值超过700亿美元。然而，这种“损失”似乎并不担心Priem，他拥有大约3000万美元的个人财富，过着听起来充实而忙碌的生活。
