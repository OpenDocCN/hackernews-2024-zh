    a district court’s injunction that permitted app developers to direct users to
    their own websites and payment platforms — a court order that came into effect
    following [the Supreme Court’s decision](https://techcrunch.com/2024/01/16/supreme-court-declines-to-hear-apple-epic-antitrust-case-meaning-developers-can-point-customers-to-the-web/)

    Though Apple had largely won the case, as the court decided it was not a monopolist,
    a judge ruled that app makers should be able to steer their customers to the web
    from links or buttons inside their apps, something that [forced Apple to change
    its App Store rules](https://techcrunch.com/2024/01/17/apple-allows-devs-to-promote-subscriptions-on-the-web-with-a-27-cut/).

  zh: 制作《堡垒之夜》的 Epic Games 对苹果打算如何遵守地区法院的禁令并不满意，该禁令允许应用开发者引导用户访问他们自己的网站和支付平台 —— 这是一项在[最高法院决定](https://techcrunch.com/2024/01/16/supreme-court-declines-to-hear-apple-epic-antitrust-case-meaning-developers-can-point-customers-to-the-web/)不审理苹果反垄断案后生效的法院命令，该决定使[目前的裁决生效](https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/10/apple-prohibited-from-blocking-outside-payment-in-epic-ruling/)。尽管苹果在这起案件中基本上取得了胜利，因为法院裁定其不是垄断者，但一位法官裁定应用开发者应该能够通过链接或按钮将其客户引导至网络，这导致[苹果不得不改变其

    on one count of out 10 in favor of Epic in its decision, finding that Apple violated
    California’s Unfair Competition law. The decision meant Apple had to remove the
    “anti-steering” clause from its agreement with App Store developers. This clause
    for years had prevented app developers from directing their customers to other
    ways to pay for in-app purchases or subscriptions from inside their apps, leading
    to confusing screens or broken features, where customers would have to figure
    out on their own how to make the necessary purchases from the developer’s website.

    Epic 的裁决，认定苹果违反了加州的不正当竞争法。这一裁决意味着苹果必须从其与 App Store 开发者的协议中删除“反引导”条款。多年来，这一条款阻止应用开发者将其客户引导至其他支付应用内购买或订阅的方式，导致令人困惑的界面或功能失效，客户必须自行弄清楚如何在开发者的网站上进行必要的购买。

    but with a lot of caveats. It said that developers would still have to pay a 27%
    cut on purchases, instead of 30%, and developers in Apple’s Small Business Program
    or auto-renewing subscriptions in their second year would be reduced to 12%, instead
    of 15%. This three percentage point discount is similar to what Google is offering
    through its User Choice billing pilot program, which counts [Spotify and Bumble
    among its early adopters.](https://techcrunch.com/2022/11/10/google-play-to-pilot-third-party-billing-in-new-markets-including-u-s-bumble-joins-spotify-as-early-tester/)
    In Google’s case, it reduced the [required commissions by 4%](https://developers-kr.googleblog.com/2021/11/enabling-alternative-billing-in-korea-en.html).
    But these small discounts aren’t enough to make alternative payment processing
    worthwhile for most developers who have to pay at least that much in payment processing
    fees, many have argued.

  zh: Apple 在[最高法院的裁决后更新了其 App Store 指南](https://techcrunch.com/2024/01/17/apple-allows-devs-to-promote-subscriptions-on-the-web-with-a-27-cut/)，但带有许多附带条件。它表示开发者仍需支付
    27% 的购买费，而不是 30%，而 Apple 的小企业计划成员或在其第二年自动续订订阅的开发者将减少到 12%，而不是 15%。这种三个百分点的折扣类似于
    Google 通过其用户选择结算试点计划提供的折扣，该计划将[Spotify 和 Bumble 列为早期采用者。](https://techcrunch.com/2022/11/10/google-play-to-pilot-third-party-billing-in-new-markets-including-u-s-bumble-joins-spotify-as-early-tester/)
    在 Google 的情况下，它将[所需的佣金减少了 4%。](https://developers-kr.googleblog.com/2021/11/enabling-alternative-billing-in-korea-en.html)
    但许多人认为，这些小的折扣不足以使大多数开发者认为使用替代支付处理方式是值得的，因为他们至少要支付同样多的支付处理费用。

    开发者们在支付给第三方支付处理器 3-6% 并支付这个新的 27% 的 Apple 税后，无法在网络上更便宜地提供他们的数字商品。
- en: In addition, he points out that Apple is strictly controlling how the new links
    and buttons must appear. In addition to forcing developers to apply for permission,
    the links can’t be in the app’s ordinary payment flow but must be in a separate
    section of the app, Sweeney explains. The links also open to a generic web browser
    session, forcing users to log in again to the developer’s website — an additional
    point of friction in making a non-App Store purchase. And then customers will
    have to initiate a search to find the item they wanted to buy, after logging in.

  zh: 此外，他指出 Apple 严格控制新链接和按钮的外观。Sweeney 解释道，除了强制开发者申请许可外，链接不能在应用程序的普通支付流程中，而必须在应用程序的一个单独部分。链接还会打开一个通用的网络浏览器会话，迫使用户重新登录到开发者的网站
    —— 这是使非 App Store 购买出现摩擦的另一个点。然后客户将不得不在登录后启动搜索，以找到他们想要购买的商品。
- en: Apple will also “front-run competing payment processors with their own ‘scare
    screen’ to disadvantage them,” Sweeney says, meaning that Apple will warn users
    about the issues that may arise when transacting with a developer outside its
    App Store. For instance, users won’t be able to cancel their subscriptions within
    Apple’s App Store or request refunds  — they’ll have to do this through the developer’s
    website.

  zh: Sweeney 表示，Apple 还将通过自己的“恐吓画面”提前竞争的支付处理器，以使其处于不利地位。例如，当用户与开发者在其 App Store 之外进行交易时，Apple
    将向用户警告可能出现的问题。例如，用户将无法在 Apple 的 App Store 内取消订阅或请求退款 —— 他们必须通过开发者的网站完成此操作。

    competition,” said Rick VanMeter, executive director of the Coalition for App
    Fairness. “These changes do nothing to enhance consumer choice, lower prices for
    in-app purchases or inject competition into Apple’s walled garden. It is precisely
    this type of abusive, monopolistic behavior that makes it imperative for Congress
    to pass the Open App Markets Act,” he added.

    the profits they exact on the backs of developers and consumers under their app
    store monopoly. Their latest move in the U.S. — imposing a 27% fee for transactions
    made outside of an app on a developer’s website — is outrageous and flies in the
    face of the court’s efforts to enable greater competition and user choice. This
    action follows similar moves by Apple to circumvent compliance in South Korea
    and The Netherlands. However, the EU’s Digital Markets Act (DMA) will finally
    put an end to this false posturing, which is essentially a recreation of Apple’s
    fees. We strongly urge the European Commission to act swiftly and decisively to
    prevent Apple from implementing similar fees, which are prohibited under the DMA.

  zh: 苹果再次表明他们不惜一切代价保护他们在应用商店垄断下从开发者和消费者身上获得的利润。他们在美国的最新举动——对开发者网站上的应用外交易征收27%的费用——是令人发指的，完全违背了法院促进更大竞争和用户选择的努力。这一行动是苹果为了规避在韩国和荷兰的合规而采取的类似行动的延续。然而，欧盟的数字市场法（DMA）最终将结束这种虚假做姿态，这实际上是苹果费用的重新创造。我们强烈呼吁欧洲委员会迅速果断地采取行动，防止苹果实施类似的被DMA禁止的费用。
