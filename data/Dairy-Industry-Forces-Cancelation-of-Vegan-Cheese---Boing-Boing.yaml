- en: Something stinks in the world of cheese, but this time it's not the product
    – it's the sour grapes emanating from the dairy industry as they try in vain to
    curdle the rise of a plant-based upstart that's threatening to spoil their future.

  zh: 奶酪世界里有什么恶臭事情发生，但这次它不是产品——它是酸葡萄气味，它来自乳制品行业，因为他们试图毫无结果地凝结一种植物为基础的新兴产品威胁到他们的未来。
- en: In a story that has enough twists and turns and heroes and villains to be a
    Netflix documentary, *[The Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/food/2024/04/27/vegan-cheese-good-food-awards-climax/)*
    reports on scandal at the prestigious Good Food Awards. A plant-based blue cheese
    was selected as a finalist, shocking high-quality artisanal dairy-based cheesemakers
    who felt it didn't belong in the competition.

  zh: '*《华盛顿邮报》*在一则报道中，描述了声名显赫的Good Food Awards的丑闻。一种植物基础的蓝纹奶酪被选为决赛选手，令高质量的手工制作乳制奶酪制造商感到震惊，并认为这种奶酪不应该参加比赛。'
- en: After initially being named a finalist, Climax Blue cheese was later disqualified
    by the Good Food Foundation, reportedly due to issues around one of the ingredients
    (kokum butter) not having GRAS certification. But Climax CEO Oliver Zahn accused
    the foundation of caving to pressure from the dairy cheese industry and changing
    the rules after the fact to disqualify his product. The foundation denies this,
    saying it was due to a complaint from someone in the community.

  zh: Climax Blue奶酪最初被评为决赛选手，后来由于其中一种成分（kokum黄油）没有GRAS认证而被Good Food基金会取消资格。但Climax首席执行官Oliver
    Zahn指责基金会在产品被取消资格后屈服于乳制奶酪行业的压力并更改规则。基金会否认了这一点，并表示是由于社区中某人的投诉。
- en: The traditional cheesemaking company is freaking out about Climax Blue, especially
    because the vegan cheese was so delicious that it had slated to win the overall
    competition before the Good Food Foundation caved to pressure.

  zh: 传统奶酪制造公司对Climax Blue感到非常恼火，特别是因为素食奶酪如此美味，以至于它在Good Food基金会屈服于压力之前已经确定赢得整个比赛。
- en: Mateo Kehler, co-owner of the Jasper Hill Farm in Vermont told *The Post*, "One
    could make the argument that this is like a fraudulent cheese. As a cheesemaker,
    it's a fraud. It looks like a cheese. It might taste like a cheese. But it's not.
    It's not connected to our historical understanding of what cheeses are."

  zh: 但是Climax首席执行官Zahn认为Climax Blue *就是* 奶酪：
- en: To Zahn, the method he's using isn't all that different from the one used for
    centuries. When it comes down to it, he notes, plants fuel the animals that produce
    milk — and so in concocting a milk made out of plants, Zahn says he's just cutting
    out the middleman (or middle-bovine). In his analysis of traditional cheesemaking,
    a cow is essentially a processing machine — and not a very efficient one at that.

  zh: 对于Zahn来说，他正在使用的方法与几个世纪以来一直在使用的方法并没有太大不同。当一切追根溯源时，他指出，植物为动物提供了食物，这些动物产生了牛奶，所以在调配由植物制成的奶酪中，Zahn说他只是在省去中间商（或中间牛）。在他对传统奶酪制作的分析中，牛基本上是一个加工机器——而且效率还不高。
- en: '"There''s a lot of energy being used to turn something from one thing to another,
    and in the case of a cow, 90 percent of the inputs go to just processing," he
    says. "There is no factory you could potentially devise that would come with that
    much processing."'

  zh: “用能源去将一样东西转变成另一样东西需要很多能源，以牛为例，90％的投入仅仅是用于加工，”他说。“你可能想象不出有什么工厂会有如此多的加工。”
- en: In the end, the dairy industry's heavy-handed attempts to keep Climax Blue from
    the spotlight have only served to amplify its rise, proving the old adage that
    the more you try to censor or suppress something, the more attention you inadvertently
    bring to it. Just like the Barbra Streisand effect, the panicked reaction of the
    traditional cheesemakers has guaranteed Climax Blue far more publicity and notoriety
    than it ever would have received by simply winning the Good Food Award outright.

  zh: 最终，乳业为了避免 Climax Blue 成为焦点而采取的强硬手段，只能让它的崛起声名大噪，证明了那句古老的格言：越是试图审查或压制某物，越会不经意地吸引更多关注。就像巴巴拉·斯特莱桑效应一样，传统奶酪制造商的惊慌反应确保了
    Climax Blue 比它如果仅仅赢得了好食品奖会得到更多的宣传和声名。
