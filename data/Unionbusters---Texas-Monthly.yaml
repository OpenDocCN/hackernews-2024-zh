    union hiring hall in Houston’s navigation district. Nearly two hundred men, dressed
    in jeans, sweatshirts, and jackets, left the hall and piled into their cars and
    pickups as if to go to work. They crossed the Ship Channel at the Wayside overpass,
    then headed down Clinton Drive along the north side of the turning basin until
    they came to the road that leads to the public docks. Passing the guard station
    at the entrance, they continued for about a hundred yards to the foot of the S-shaped
    turnoff road, where they parked. Then in groups of twenty and thirty they wound
    their way on foot past the Strachan Shipping storage yard and behind the tin warehouses
    that face the water, emerging at the flat, open expanse of concrete at Public
    Dock 8\. The men gathered in dark little knots there, in front of the *Samu,*
    a black ship that had moored during the night.

- en: The *Samu* was carrying 6200 tons of Brazilian steel scheduled for unloading
    that morning. The men were members of the International Longshoremen’s Association
    (ILA), an AFL-CIO union. ILA men had loaded and discharged all ships at Houston’s
    public wharves for fifty years. They had not been hired to unload the *Samu,*
    however. They had come to Dock 8 not to work but, their leaders would say, to
    protest the awarding of the unloading contracts to Hank Milam and his company,
    Houston Stevedores, a firm that did not hire ILA men. But the massing of men on
    Dock 8, perhaps only because those men were longshoremen, gave another impression.
    It looked as if they had come to prevent the *Samu*’s unloading.

    at worst mocked, the law. A restraining order in force for months warned the ILA
    against “molesting, interfering with, threatening violence or bodily harm” to
    Milam and the men of Houston Stevedores. That morning ILA officers had called
    a special meeting at the union hall, taken a vote, and passed out picket signs.
    They had urged their men to go to Dock 8 to protest—clearly a legal activity—and
    had admonished them not to obstruct the performance of work, because obstruction
    was illegal. The vital question was, Would they obey? When Milam and his men set
    foot on Dock 8, would the unionists move aside?

    foremen and about forty laborers he had contracted at $8 an hour from the International
    Brotherhood of Teamsters, which is not part of the AFL-CIO fold. One of Milam’s
    foremen had driven down the turnoff road toward Dock 8 shortly after the protesting
    longshoremen arrived. Pickets blocked his path. The foreman was convinced that
    if he tried to take his crew to the dock, the ILA men would attack. The situation
    promised to spark the biggest waterfront brawl in memory and gave the foreman
    reason to hesitate. He held his crew at the guard station, a quarter of a mile
    from the docks.

    的一个领班沿着通向 8 号码头的岔路驶下去。抗议者挡住了他的路。领班确信，如果他试图把他的队伍带到码头，国际长shore工人联合会的人会发动攻击。这种情况预示着将引发近年来最大的海滨斗殴事件，这让领班有理由犹豫。他把他的队伍留在警卫站，距离码头有四分之一英里。
- en: What was brewing was a classic labor confrontation. It was also a drama that
    epitomized the plight of unions in both Texas and the United States. Unions had
    negotiated and mitigated the class struggle of the thirties and forties. Even
    in Texas, a right-to-work state, they had organized refineries, auto and aircraft
    plants, meatpacking houses, and telephone companies. They had helped create a
    large, prosperous middle class in America, one that gave the nation political
    stability and insulation against radicalism. But now in the eighties, with hard
    times, a hostile White House, and employers poised for the kill, unions seemed
    to be in danger of extinction. One of the scripts being played out on Dock 8 called
    for longshoremen to reenact the bitter battles of their union’s rise. Another
    called for them to surrender to the men like Hank Milam and the economic forces
    that said that unions were of no use anymore.

    as a supplier of labor to companies in the business of stevedoring, or the loading
    and unloading of ships. The union’s dominance extended to 36 other ports on the
    Atlantic, the Gulf, and the Great Lakes. Time and again it had defended its role
    with a willingness to strike against management and to scrap with members of rival
    labor clans.

- en: Hank Milam was a small-time Houston stevedore who had less than $20,000 worth
    of equipment and an office in a building whose chief attraction was a deferred-payment
    leasing plan. In the previous nine months, by underbidding stevedores who hired
    Houston’s 2500 ILA members, Milam had won two dozen contracts for ships berthed
    in the navigation canal, but until the day the *Samu* moored, he had never tried
    to set foot in the sanctum sanctorum of the ILA, the public docks. Alone, Milam
    was hardly a threat to the ILA’s strength. But ever since 1981, when the nation’s
    president had taken on the Professional Air Traffic Controllers Organization and
    flattened it, union members everywhere had been on the alert. Following PATCO’s
    demise, unions like the United Auto Workers, whose employers faced Japanese competition,
    had been forced to forgo or postpone planned wage increases. Finally, even unions
    with no foreign competitors—the Amalgamated Transit Union, for example, which
    represented Greyhound bus drivers—had been pressed to give back the gains they
    had won. As the dollar grew stronger during 1984 and 1985, exports continued to
    decline, and because the oil market had gone to pot, Houston’s maritime traffic
    was in a slump. Every time Milam underbid a unionized stevedore, managers of competing
    companies demanded that the ILA take cuts in work gang size, benefits, and pay.
    Milam’s activities had inspired non-ILA stevedoring operations in other ports.
    The *Samu* had already called in Tampa Bay and New Orleans, and it had been unloaded
    in both places by non-ILA laborers. If Hank Milam wasn’t stopped, Houston’s ILA
    men believed, the union would be imperiled from Texas to Maine.

    Milam，休斯顿的ILA人认为，从德克萨斯到缅因州的工会将受到威胁。

    After earning a journalism degree in his home state during the late sixties, he
    served a tour of duty as an Army intelligence sergeant in Korea, then returned
    home to manage an uncle’s trucking company. Through connections he made on a golf
    course, he arranged to become an executive for Dixie Stevedores in 1978, and he
    moved to Houston to begin the job. He was appalled by the double-digit wages that
    Dixie and other union stevedores grudgingly paid union men. “It didn’t take a
    lot of intelligence to see that people were being hired all over town for six
    to eight dollars an hour,” he says. “But nobody had the guts to bring them to
    the waterfront.” In March 1984, with $2000 that he says he borrowed from a friend,
    Hank Milam founded Houston Stevedores. He hoped to get rich quick by outmaneuvering

- en: The President’s Commission on Organized Crime has cited the ILA as a union under
    mob influence, if only because leaders of some New York–New Jersey locals had
    personal business ties to suspected mafiosi. But the specter of becoming the target
    of a Mafia hit team didn’t deter Milam. He declared war by circulating brochures
    that offered stevedoring services at rates 25 to 50 per cent below those of established
    ILA-employer firms. “I didn’t have to base my prices on cost,” boasts Milam. “
    I based them on competition.” But shipping lines and cargo owners were reluctant
    to tempt the legendary and seemingly invincible ire of the ILA. During his first
    year of business, Milam won contracts to handle cargoes, but only on ships that
    were safely berthed at out-of-the-way private docks. In April 1985 he bid to load
    17,000 tons of grain onto a ship called the *Lone Star.* His bid, 55 cents a ton,
    was about a dime per ton below the bids of his competitors. The owners of the
    cargo gave Milam the stevedoring contract, even though the ship was to be loaded
    at the Cargill grain elevator, an important private facility just inside the Ship
    Channel waters traditionally worked by the ILA. On the morning when Milam and
    his crew, all nonunion men, arrived to load the *Lone Star,* about fifty ILA pickets
    stood at the entrance to the elevator. Milam’s tactical and business sense told
    him that his men didn’t need to charge the picket line. He hired a helicopter
    to fly them onto the ship and off, and he still made a handsome profit. Hank Milam
    had won his first skirmish with the ILA, and by the measure of Gulf maritime affairs,
    it was historic; fifty years had passed since non-ILA men had loaded any grain
    ship in the region’s deepwater ports.

    Star*时，大约五十名国际长工联合会的示威者站在升降机入口处。米兰的战术和商业敏感告诉他，他的工人不需要冲破封锁线。他雇了一架直升机将他们送上船，再将他们带走，最终他仍赚得可观的利润。汉克·米兰赢得了他与国际长工联合会的第一次小冲突，在墨西哥湾海事事务的评估中，这是历史性的；五十年来，非国际长工联合会的工人没有在该地区的深水港口装载任何谷物船。

    strikebreakers gathered every day to ride through Houston’s navigation district—practically
    a shooting gallery—in armored trucks. When the vehicles were fired upon, guards
    fired back. Both sides ignored warnings from their foes and scoffed at court orders.
    When their partisans were arrested, both sides hired lawyers who helped even the
    guilty enter self-defense pleas. The strike spread east to Mobile, Alabama, and

    if you only bloodied his nose, he’d go anyhow,” recalls Gilbert Mers, 78, an ILA

    January 2, waiting for his cousin Grant to come down the turnoff road with the
    other men from Houston Stevedores. Calvin is a tall, thin man with strawberry-blond
    hair. He kept an eye out for Grant because he had a bone to pick with him. Dock
    8, Calvin thought, was the appropriate place. Like Grant, Calvin is a grandson
    of ILA progenitor Floyd Akers, but Calvin has remained steadfast to the family’s
    union tradition. Calvin is grateful to the ILA; because of the union, he says,
    his and other longshoremen’s families have been able to partake of the nation’s
    prosperity. Calvin has not been able to vacation in Cozumel, as bachelor Grant
    has, nor have he and his wife, Michele, been able to travel outside of Texas more
    than once. They don’t own a powerboat or a lake house or a Bronco or any of the
    other coveted totems of working-class life in East Texas. But they have been able
    to rear their three small children in a brick house in a wooded suburb, and thus
    far, Michele hasn’t had to seek work outside the home. Calvin believes that not
    only his union wage but also his willingness to work has made his relative security
    possible. “I’ll take any job I can get, even slinging bags of rice, and no matter
    how cold it is, I’ll go to work because I know I’ve got to work to live,” he says.
    Grant, Calvin maintains, was afraid of hard work long before he left the union
    fold. “Grant’s problem is that he’s just sorry. He didn’t want to do the kind
    of hard work we have to do. He left the union because those other guys offered
    him a soft foreman’s job.”

    divided by strips of yellow vinyl tape into large squares, each marked with a
    number corresponding to years of seniority. Each morning ILA crew foremen step
    out from behind a glassed-in enclosure onto the floor, clipboards in hand. The
    papers on the clipboards carry notations about the names, locations, and cargoes
    of ships and the number of longshoremen, winchmen, crane operators, and truck
    and lift drivers needed for each job. Men get to choose their jobs, but the picking
    starts at the high-seniority end of the floor, and the distance is great: Texas
    ILA workers average 49 years of age, and many have 25 years on the docks. In good
    times the seniority system is benign. Senior longshoremen claim the easiest jobs
    for themselves, but there are jobs for everyone. In bad times it becomes painfully
    evident to younger men that the union, which is supposed to wrest an equitable
    deal out of the waterfront’s economic system, has imposed a hierarchy of its own.
    Plutocracy may rule the waterfront, but gerontocracy rules the union hall. Grant
    Akers began standing on a numbered square at the union hall during the oil-and-inflation-fueled
    boom of the late seventies. When the bust came and he hadn’t advanced to a number
    high enough to be safe from the scarcity of jobs, his association with the ILA

    the sling method. Whereas Houston stevedores could load 200 bales of cotton per

    the union struck for the privilege of dictating the size of work gangs, a power

    with efforts to impose a royalty on every container to be paid into pension funds
    and plans that guaranteed every ILA member a full, 52-week salary, regardless
    of the availability of work. The fight broke out again and again over demands
    that shippers hire ILA men and not the cheaper Teamsters for all stripping and
    stuffing performed within a fifty-mile radius of ports. Though Houston’s ILA men
    had to back their demands with a 101-day strike in 1968 and 1969, the union was
    victorious from Maine to Texas. The ILA won because the Vietnam War, inflation,
    and a vigorous domestic economy boosted international trade and induced a labor
    shortage. It also won because management knew that the union’s victory was Pyrrhic;
    containerization proceeded, and that meant that the future belonged to fewer longshoremen
    than had been needed in the past. The ILA’s strategy was aimed at protecting the

  zh: 国际长shore联合会（ILA）在抗击集装箱化影响的斗争始于1964年，当时工会罢工要求控制工作小组的规模，这是原本只有装卸工拥有的权力。这场斗争贯穿整个60年代，他们努力推行每个集装箱征收的特许金，以支付养老基金，并计划确保每位ILA成员全年52周的工资，无论工作是否有空。这场斗争一次又一次地爆发，要求货主雇佣ILA成员而不是便宜的卡车司机，用于所有在港口五十英里半径内进行的装卸工作。虽然休斯顿的ILA成员不得不在1968年和1969年进行长达101天的罢工，但工会从缅因到得克萨斯取得了胜利。ILA之所以取得胜利，是因为越南战争、通货膨胀和充满活力的国内经济推动了国际贸易并导致劳动力短缺。它还因为管理层知道工会的胜利是短视的；集装箱化进程不断推进，这意味着未来需要的码头工人将比过去少。ILA的战略旨在保护其资深成员的地位，比如卡尔文·阿克斯这样的人，而不是确保像他表弟格兰特这样的人有未来的工作。
- en: The triumphant ILA soon became arrogant. It won sixteen holidays for its members,
    including the birthday of Thomas W. “Teddy” Gleason, Sr., its longtime international
    president. It required stevedores to hire ILA winchmen and flagmen who weren’t
    needed on every ship. Waterfront-wise seniors often signed up for two featherbed
    jobs at a time, collected two paychecks for a single eight-hour shift, and sometimes
    didn’t present themselves for work at either one. “Double-dipping,” as the two-check
    scheme was called, disappeared during the late seventies, when waterfront payrolls
    were computerized, but another featherbedding tactic, double-barreling, continued.
    “I’ve seen times,” Grant Akers says, “when there would be eight men sent to work
    on a vessel whose holds didn’t have room for more than four. The extra four would
    just sit around, double-barreling, doing nothing. But they were still on the payroll.”
    About a fifth of the 11,000 longshoremen from the Port of New York–New Jersey,
    largely a container port, are now living without working at all, on the basis
    of checks from the union’s guaranteed annual income program. To finance the plan
    and an increasing pension burden, the ILA hiked the rates for employer-paid benefits.
    Today Calvin Akers earns $17 an hour in wages, but to hire him, employers must
    pay an additional $6.50 an hour into ILA benefit programs. When all labor expenses
    are tallied, including workmen’s compensation and insurance, it costs about $35
    an hour to employ an ILA longshoreman. Hank Milam brought his Teamsters to the
    public docks on January 2 for a total of $13.50 an hour.

  zh: 布鲁纳接受撤退战术标志着他工会主义的品牌。五十年前，当大多数工会人士与警卫和破坏罢工的人争斗以建立他们的组织时，工会运动是一种福音传教的，几乎是千禧年的事业。工会发言人大多数是工团主义者、激进分子和社会主义者；一些人甚至彻底是红色的。在左倾领导者眼中，工会大厅不是商业场所，而是教堂，是传教和聚集会众追求目标的地方，这些目标不在于现在，而在于未来更加平等的世界。那些日子里的工会运动，即使不够现实，至少是受启发的。主张妥协就等于主张犯罪。
- en: The debate over radicalism had started early in the ILA. In the mid-thirties
    its West Coast locals, led by the leftist Harry Bridges, in defiance of instructions
    from the union’s New York headquarters, had precipitated general strikes and participated
    in sympathy strikes, especially with seamen. By 1937 East-West relations in the
    ILA had grown so tense that Bridges bolted the ILA, establishing a new Pacific
    dockers organization, the International Longshoremen’s and Warehousemen’s Association.
    Stung by the loss of the union’s western membership, ILA leaders helped spur the
    drive to purge radicals from labor’s ranks, a process that began at the onset
    of World War II and was completed in the mid-fifties. The deradicalized union
    revived an older, more moderate school of union philosophy, sometimes called business
    unionism. Le Roy Bruner was a product of that outlook.

  zh: 激进主义的辩论在ILA早期就开始了。三十年代中期，由左派Harry Bridges领导的其西海岸地区的本地工会，不顾工会纽约总部的指示，引发了总罢工，并积极参与了同情罢工，尤其是与海员的合作。到1937年，ILA东西部之间的关系已经变得如此紧张，以至于Bridges脱离了ILA，成立了一个新的太平洋码头工人组织，国际码头工人及仓储工人协会。受到失去工会西部成员的打击，ILA领导人协助推动了从工会中清除激进分子的运动，这一过程始于二战初期，到五十年代中期完成。去激进化的工会复兴了一种更为温和的工会哲学，有时称为商业工会主义。Le
    Roy Bruner就是这种观念的产物。
- en: Advocates of business unionism regard themselves as salesmen of a commodity—labor—in
    an economy whose ground rules are essentially beyond question. The business unionist
    sees his role as one characterized by research, persuasion, mediation, and compromise;
    sincerity, brawn, and lawlessness are the weapons of the radical school. Le Roy
    Bruner, because he was a business unionist, did not feel that he had betrayed
    or failed his men by going to them with proposals for compromise. He was quite
    sure that the rise of Hank Milam was not because of evils inherent in the economic
    system but because of the decline in maritime commerce.

    Roy Bruner并不觉得通过向他们提出妥协方案而背叛或辜负了他的同事们。他非常确信，Hank Milam的崛起不是因为经济体系内在的弊端，而是因为海上贸易的衰落。

    are apt to distrust leaders who, like most ILA officers, live in relative ease.
    It had been more than ten years since Bruner had quit working “off the floor”
    to assume the white-collar duties of a local vice president. As the local’s president
    for a year, he’d earned an annual salary of $93,000—enough to make him suspect.
    In November Le Roy Bruner will face reelection. He already knew that there were
    men in his local who believed that he hadn’t taken a hard enough line with management.
    And Bruner had a special problem: his union critics included Teddy Gleason, the
    ILA’s 85-year-old international president. In September, with Bruner’s support,
    Gulf locals had voted to forgo a $l-an-hour raise for work on grain ships. But
    wages are one of the items in a seven-point master contract, uniform in all ILA
    ports, that is negotiated in New York by a committee of national union and management
    leaders. In late September, Gleason and the International, as the union’s New
    York headquarters are called, had rebuked Gulf leaders for undermining the master
    contract and had ordered ILA locals to accept the wage hike, whether they wanted
    it or not. Thanks to hard times and Hank Milam, Le Roy Bruner had become a union

    Milam，Le Roy Bruner已经成为一个不能指望上下支持的工会领导者。

    we have little reason to fear the future. We are sure that economic terms like
    “strong dollar” and “balance of trade” have some relation to us, but since we
    live in a workaday world largely made in the USA, we are not exactly sure what
    those terms might mean. Longshoremen are no better economists than the rest of
    us, yet every day when they go to the hiring hall, those vague economic terms
    determine whether longshoremen work today or hope for tomorrow. The strengthened
    dollar, more than any other factor, has minimized Houston’s grain exports because
    Third World countries can’t afford to buy our grain anymore. But longshoremen
    can’t find consolation or a scapegoat in the economists’ lexicon. Incorporeal
    demons can’t be fought; cops and men like Hank Milam can. Most of the protesters

    they would lose if they did—but they had also resolved not to back down until

    thus far had been only a battle of nerves. “I figured that the police would settle
    the whole thing,” Calvin Akers says, “but they hadn’t come down there yet.” When
    Bruner finished his speech, a few seconds passed in silence, and then someone
    in the crowd yelled, “We’re staying right here, where our jobs are!” The cry was

    Numerical superiority wasn’t on the lawmen’s side. “We were outnumbered and so

    Any incident on the dock would take place in the full view of the press and might
    embarrass the whole waterfront business community, not to mention the police.

    see that the ship’s loading was accomplished quickly, because an idle ship meant
    idle capital. Minutes after his arrival in Houston at about sunup, he and another
    ship’s agent had crossed the ILA’s picket line, boarded the *Samu* to confer with

  zh: Milam 与 ILA 的冲突引发的公告，在码头和法庭上，成为了一则好的广告。在某些圈子里，他成为了民间英雄，一时之间的企业家。Milam 的办公室被来自货物接收方的询问和祝贺淹没，有些来自新英格兰地区。尽管几艘他签约的船只在
    Dock 8 的风波后退出使用他的服务，但 Hank Milam 的主要业务问题不再是赢得合同，而是资本短缺以扩展。2 月初，Milam 在休斯顿开设了一个仓库，让非
    ILA 人员负责剥除和装填通过的集装箱。
- en: He also began operations in New Orleans and Mobile, and in March he opened offices
    in both ports. With supervisors from Houston and locally recruited Teamsters,
    his company unloaded a ship on the public docks in New Orleans—unthinkably, on
    Mardi Gras, an ILA holiday. In late March, Milam announced plans—which so startled
    the maritime shipping community that the story was carried on the front page of
    the *Journal of Commerce,* the shipping industry’s daily—to begin doing business
    in the Port of New York–New Jersey, the hallowed ground of the International.
    Two months after he lost the *Samu,* Hank Milam could boast that he had become
    the biggest non-ILA stevedore in the nation. The honor was a small one, but it
    took on new significance with every passing week. The organization of non-ILA
    stevedores that Milam and his cohorts had inaugurated in late 1985 had by the
    spring of this year claimed a total of 22 public affiliates and an undisclosed
    number of covert members. Waterfront businessmen speculated that the closet membership
    was an indication that companies bound by ILA contracts were about to father secretly
    owned subsidiaries that would hire non-ILA longshoremen. “Double-breasting,” a
    tactic used in the construction industry to foil government minority hiring and
    prevailing wage rules, was on the agenda for companies that work the docks.

  zh: 他还在新奥尔良和莫比尔开始了业务，并于三月在两个港口开设了办事处。带领来自休斯顿和当地招募的工会成员，他的公司在新奥尔良的公共码头上卸下了一艘船——令人难以置信的是，在狂欢节上，一个
    ILA 的假期。三月底，Milam 宣布计划——如此之惊动航运界，以至于这个故事被载入了《商业日报》的头版，这是航运行业的日报——开始在纽约-新泽西港口进行业务，这是国际的神圣之地。在失去
    *Samu* 两个月后，Hank Milam 可以夸耀他已经成为全国最大的非 ILA 装卸工。这个荣誉虽然微不足道，但随着每一周的过去，它都变得越来越重要。Milam
    和他的同伙在 1985 年末发起的非 ILA 装卸工组织，在今年春天已经声称拥有 22 个公开附属机构和数不明的秘密成员。滨水区的商人推测，秘密成员身份的存在表明，受
    ILA 合同约束的公司即将成立秘密子公司，雇佣非 ILA 码头工人。“双重胸部”，这是在建筑行业用来躲避政府少数族裔雇佣和最低工资规定的战术，正在那些操作码头的公司议程上。
- en: Milam had also sparked an aboveboard counterrevolution. On January 24 the West
    Gulf Maritime Association announced its refusal to join other employer groups
    in new ILA master contract talks. Within two weeks, employers’ associations in
    New Orleans, Mobile, and eastern Florida joined the boycott. By the end of February
    only four management groups remained in the dozen-member committee that had negotiated
    previous master contracts, and even they postponed the opening of contract talks.

  zh: Milam 也引发了一场公开的反革命。1 月 24 日，西湾海事协会宣布拒绝加入其他雇主团体的新 ILA 总合同谈判。两周内，新奥尔良、莫比尔和东佛罗里达的雇主协会加入了抵制行动。到
    2 月底，之前参与过总合同谈判的十几个委员会成员中，只剩下四个管理团体，甚至连他们都推迟了合同谈判的开启。
- en: In early April, as the whole maritime industry watched, Houston’s ILA longshoremen
    and negotiators for the WGMA began their own round of talks. On April 9, while
    the ILA and the WGMA were cooking up their new deal, Milam’s men again challenged
    the ILA on the public docks. A grain barge, the *Producer,* was pushed into port
    by a tugboat out of New Orleans. The barge was to be loaded at Dock 14, site of
    a public grain elevator, with wheat bound for Haiti. On the morning of April 9,
    policemen escorted Hank Milam’s men to work, barricaded the dock, and encircled
    the ship with as many as fifty patrol cars. Nobody but cops and Milam’s men reached
    the barge—except for two representatives of Doyle Varner’s company, Empire-United.
    Varner’s men offered the tug’s captain a competitive loading rate; he spurned
    them. Half a dozen ILA pickets stood by, at a safe and legal distance, for three
    days while the *Producer* took on its cargo. Milam’s men completed their work,
    and the barge was towed out of port without incident.

  zh: 4月初，整个海事行业都在关注的情况下，休斯敦的ILA长工和WGMA的谈判代表开始了他们自己的谈判。4月9日，在ILA和WGMA商定他们的新协议时，米兰的人再次在公共码头上挑战了ILA。一艘名为*Producer*的谷物驳船由一艘新奥尔良的拖船推进港口。这艘驳船将在14号码头，一个公共粮食升降机的场地，装载驶往海地的小麦。4月9日早晨，警察护送汉克·米兰的人上工，封锁了码头，并用多达五十辆巡逻车围住了这艘船。除了警察和米兰的人之外，多伊尔·瓦纳的公司Empire-United的两名代表也到达了。瓦纳的人给拖船船长提供了具有竞争力的装载费率；他们被拒绝了。半打ILA的抗议者在合法且安全的距离外守候了三天，而*Producer*装载货物完毕后，这艘驳船顺利离港。
- en: Milam had won, and he had won on ILA turf—the public docks. Ten days later,
    on April 21, Houston’s ILA men voted to accept what amounted to a new contract,
    much of it effective immediately, which granted such large concessions that it
    was hailed as a “landmark” contract; the base wage was reduced to $14 an hour.
    The locals were ready to compete with Milam, but there was the question of whether
    the International would approve the contract or whether it would ask the ILA rank
    and file to vote for a strike in the fall. And there was the still larger question
    of whether the union would survive.

  zh: 米兰赢了，而且他是在ILA的地盘上——公共码头上赢得的。十天后，即4月21日，休斯顿的ILA人投票接受了一个几乎立即生效的新合同，其中包含大量让步，被誉为“里程碑”合同；基础工资降至每小时14美元。地方组织准备与米兰竞争，但问题是国际组织是否会批准该合同，或者是否会要求ILA基层投票在秋季罢工。还有更大的问题是工会是否能够存活。
- en: Like most other American unions, the ILA is now on the defensive. Yet it is
    important to recall that strong organizations like the ILA were built not on the
    general conditions for labor but as a defense against specific threats, such as
    the container. The evangelistic fervor of the union movement, without which many
    participants thought unions could not survive, has been gone for thirty years.
    Yet unions endure despite declines, as churches have endured. Billy Sunday died,
    but he has been superseded by evangelists of the electronic church, and nothing
    stands in the way of a future revival of unionism.

  zh: 像大多数其他美国工会一样，ILA现在处于防御状态。然而，重要的是要记住，像ILA这样强大的组织不是基于劳工的一般状况，而是作为对特定威胁的防御，比如集装箱。工会运动的狂热传教，许多参与者认为工会无法生存，已经消失了三十年。然而，尽管有所下降，工会仍然存在，如同教堂一样。比利·桑迪去世了，但他已经被电子教会的传道者所取代，未来工会主义复兴已毫无阻碍。
- en: For the ILA, that revival may come this fall, when a national ILA referendum
    could force Houston’s union longshoremen out on strike whether they want it or
    not. If a strike comes, Hank Milam will replace the shipping container as the
    inspiration for the change. Union and management leaders are predicting that a
    strike won’t happen, but then they always do. Prudent, self-interested men don’t
    predict strikes or hurricanes. Like mayors of coastal tourist towns who don’t
    want to speculate about the possibility of hurricanes, union and management men
    don’t speculate about strikes. But strikes and hurricanes do happen, and on the
    waterfront both are potentially deadly and damaging.

  zh: 对于ILA来说，工会主义的复兴可能会在今年秋天到来，届时全国ILA公投可能会迫使休斯敦的工会长工不论是否愿意都举行罢工。如果发生罢工，汉克·米兰将取代装运集装箱成为变革的灵感。工会和管理领导人预测罢工不会发生，但事实上他们总是这样预测。谨慎和自私的人不会预测罢工或飓风。就像沿海旅游城镇的市长不愿意猜测飓风可能性一样，工会和管理人员也不猜测罢工。但罢工和飓风确实会发生，在海港两者都有潜在的致命和破坏性。
- en: The most likely beneficiaries of a fall ILA strike—in the short run anyhow—are
    non-ILA stevedores like Hank Milam. Most of them are already making preparations
    to get rich quick. They have made money by underbidding competitors who hire workers
    from the ILA, and now they are ready to make their fortunes when those employers
    are struck by the ILA. When union and management disagree, entrepreneurs like
    Hank Milam make bucks.

  zh: 最可能从 ILA 罢工中受益的人——至少在短期内——是非 ILA 驳船工人，比如汉克·米勒姆。他们中的大多数已经在做准备，准备快速致富。他们通过以低于雇佣
    ILA 工人的竞争对手的价格出售货物赚取了钱，现在当这些雇主被 ILA 罢工时，他们准备发财。当工会和管理层意见分歧时，像汉克·米勒姆这样的企业家就会赚大钱。
