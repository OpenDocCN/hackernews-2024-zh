    tropes associated with tech support. But as someone who is often asked by family

    tools.

- en: As a programmer, I understand this fact intuitively. When a program I’ve written
    has first booted up, it is in its most pristine, perfect state. I have lovingly
    crafted every variable and array to be exactly how I intend it to be. If I have
    automated tests, then this is the state that is most heavily tested.

    the browser’s back and forward buttons, and the refresh button, and they’ve booted
    up the program after a few weeks of inactivity, so that some of the data has become
    stale, or maybe they installed an update and now they’ve got some locally cached
    files that were designed for an older version of the app… It’s here that users
    run into the countless errors, crashes, and freezes associated with software that
    finds itself in a state that the original programmers didn’t intend.

    few years, so she reinstalled it and clicked the icon, but it refused to load.
    I googled around and couldn’t find a solution, so, on a hunch, I deleted the `~/Library/Application
    Support/Steam` folder, where Steam was apparently storing data, and relaunched
    it. Poof! It worked.

    bar, no matter how many times she refreshed. So I opened up the handy Chrome DevTools
    “Application” tab, clicked [“Clear storage”](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/manage-data/local-storage#clear-storage),
    and what do you know? After refreshing and logging in again, everything worked.

- en: Having a dedicated program to clean up your own program’s files may seem a bit
    ridiculous, like an admission of defeat, but I actually think it’s kind of brilliant.
    As a programmer, it’s impossible to predict all the states that your program can
    end up in. You can use something like [XState](https://xstate.js.org/) to help
    visualize it, but when you start multiplying the possible states by the cached
    configuration files by the different versions of the software by the *different
    teams of people* who built each version… it just becomes unfeasible to plan for
    every outcome. (Let alone write tests for every possible state!) So rather than
    having software that doesn’t work, maybe it’s better to just admit your own human
    frailty, and offer a way for users to start from scratch.

  zh: 拥有一个专门的程序来清理你自己程序的文件可能看起来有点荒谬，像是承认失败，但我实际上认为这有点聪明。作为一个程序员，不可能预测你的程序可能陷入的所有状态。你可以使用类似于[XState](https://xstate.js.org/)来帮助可视化，但当你开始将可能的状态乘以缓存配置文件再乘以软件的不同版本再乘以*构建每个版本的不同团队的人*时……计划每个结果变得不可行。（更不用说为每种可能的状态编写测试了！）因此，与其拥有不起作用的软件，也许承认自己的人类脆弱性，提供一种让用户可以从头开始的方式可能更好。
- en: 'Mozilla’s [“Refresh Firefox”](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/refresh-firefox-reset-add-ons-and-settings)
    feature is another brilliant application of this principle. If you haven’t used
    Firefox in a while, then it will pop up a little alert offering to blow everything
    away and start from scratch. This is probably a great way to avoid attrition to
    other browsers: I’m sure plenty of people switch from Browser A to Browser B because
    on day 1, Browser B feels so much faster – not because B is actually superior
    to A, but because B isn’t bogged down with a bunch of extensions, settings, history,
    leftover update files, etc.'

  zh: Mozilla的[“刷新Firefox”](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/refresh-firefox-reset-add-ons-and-settings)功能是这一原则的又一个精彩应用。如果你有一段时间没有使用Firefox，它会弹出一个小提示，询问是否彻底清除所有内容然后重新开始。这可能是避免用户流失到其他浏览器的好方法：我相信很多人会从浏览器A转到浏览器B，因为在第一天，浏览器B感觉要快得多——不是因为B真的比A更优越，而是因为B没有被一堆扩展、设置、历史记录、残留更新文件等所拖累。

    you have the luxury of writing code that can be tested with formal proofs, it’s
    impossible to predict every possible state that your code can be in. So maybe
    the best bet is to just provide some kind of escape hatch, so that at least it’s
    easy to “turn it off and back on again.”

  zh: 我对这个问题没有解决方案。软件很复杂，除非你有幸编写可以通过正式证明测试的代码，否则不可能预测代码可能出现的每种状态。所以也许最好的办法就是提供某种逃生舱口，这样至少可以轻松地“关闭然后重新启动”。
