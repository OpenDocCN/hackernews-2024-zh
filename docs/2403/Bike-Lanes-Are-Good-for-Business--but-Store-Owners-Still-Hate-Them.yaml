    change, cut traffic fatalities, and make cities healthier and more pleasant. But
    they also take away parking spaces, which makes it tougher for shoppers to load

    each borough, sales in the bike-friendly areas soared by 84 percentage points
    in Brooklyn, 9 percentage points in Manhattan, and 32 percentage points in the

    serving locals did way better than places serving a wider area. In the other district,
    sales tanked relative to the number of people a shop employed, suggesting that
    bike lanes gave an advantage to smaller businesses. “The takeaway is that it’s
    probably a minimal effect on businesses when you put in a bike lane,” Poirer says.
    “That actually makes a lot of sense. If you think of a busy downtown district,
    there’s not that many parking spaces relative to the number of people who come
    to the business.” In this case, bike lanes didn’t seem to help businesses much.

  zh: 结果却是参差不齐。在三个地区中的两个中，为本地居民服务的商店和餐馆的表现远好于为更广泛地区服务的地方。在另一个地区，销售相对于商店雇佣的人数大幅下降，这表明自行车道为小型企业带来了优势。“结论是，当你修建自行车道时，对商业的影响可能很小，”
    Poirer说道。“这其实很有道理。如果你考虑一个繁忙的市中心区域，相对于来店的人数，停车位并不多。”在这种情况下，自行车道似乎并没有对商业有太大帮助。但总体而言，它们并没有带来负面影响。

    at [businesses directly adjacent](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0361198119850465)
    to two kinds of bike infrastructure — Class II, which creates dedicated bike lanes
    denoted by a paint stripe, and Class III, where signs instruct cars and bikes
    to share the street. (Either way, blocks with the new lanes lost an average of
    three parking spaces.) Once again, the results were mixed. On Class II lanes,
    bars and barber shops and banks enjoyed increases in sales, while furniture stores
    and gas stations were more likely to experience decreases. Older businesses tended
    to decline more than new ones. Overall, in the year after the bike infrastructure
    went in, businesses on Class II streets lost a median of $27,921 compared with
    $19,390 for those on Class III lanes. But similar shops that weren’t on a bike
    lane lost $25,296\. When it came to bike lanes, there were lots and lots of winners.

    II街道上的企业与Class III街道上的企业相比，中位数损失分别为$27,921和$19,390。但是，那些不在自行车道上的类似商店损失了$25,296。在自行车道方面，有很多赢家。但也有一些输家。
