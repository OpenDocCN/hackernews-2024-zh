- en: If you've ever wished that you could turn invisible, here's your chance. A consumer
    "invisibility shield" has just hit Kickstarter, and it could be yours for as little
    as £54 (about US$68).

- en: Manufactured by the London-based Invisibility Shield Co, the Invisibility Shield
    2.0 is being offered in Mini, Full and Megashield sizes. As its name implies,
    it's the new-and-improved successor to the company's original Invisibility Shield.

- en: Well, the Shield takes the form of a curved sheet of clear high-grade polycarbonate,
    which is held upright by a clear polycarbonate frame on the back. An array of
    tall, skinny lenses is embedded side-by-side in that sheet, each lens running
    all the way from the top to the bottom of the Shield.

- en: As the user stands or crouches behind the device, the lenses diffuse the ambient
    light that's reflected by their body across the entire front surface of the Shield.
    That said, the lenses also diffuse the light reflected by the user's *background*
    across the whole front.

- en: Because the user is much narrower than their background, the light from their
    body is essentially drowned out by the light from the background. As a result,
    someone viewing the Shield from the front sees just the diffused background light,
    which blends right in with their view of the background itself.

- en: The Shield works best if the user is wearing light-colored clothing, and if
    the background is fairly uniform in appearance – horizontal lines in the background
    really help sell the illusion. It doesn't matter how far away the viewer is, as
    the effect remains the same.

    *use* the Shield for?

- en: We're told that applications of the original Invisibility Shield have included
    hiding contestants on a Korean dating show, staying unseen when playing paintball,
    performing stage magic, hiding small items on an office desk for entertainment
    purposes, and observing wildlife. Potential backers should take note, however,
    that users can't clearly see their surroundings *through* the Shield – they have
    to peek around it.

    whereas the Megashield measures 6 ft by 4 ft (183 by 122 cm). The Mini – which
    hides things like "small items on an office desk" – comes in at 1 ft by 7.9 in
    (30.5 by 20 cm).

    reaches production, a pledge of £299 (about US$378) will get you the Full, £699
    ($883) will get you the Megashield, and £54 ($68) will get you the Mini. The three
    models can be seen in use, in the video below.

    lighter, stronger, stabler, brighter, easier to carry, and viewable from a wider
    angle than the original model.
