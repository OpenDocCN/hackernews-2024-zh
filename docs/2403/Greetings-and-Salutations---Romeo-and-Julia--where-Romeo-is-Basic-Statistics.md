Hello there. This is an open source/access book entitled: “Romeo and Julia, where Romeo is Basic Statistics”. So I guess it’s gonna be about a programming language named [Julia](https://julialang.org/) and its usage for basic statistics.

This book was generated using [Books.jl](https://github.com/JuliaBooks/Books.jl) starting with [BookTemplate](https://github.com/JuliaBooks/BookTemplate).

The book is also available as [**PDF**](./RJ_BS_eng.pdf).

The template for this book can be found [here](https://github.com/b-lukaszuk/RJ_BS_eng) and the code snippets for the chapters are available [there](https://github.com/b-lukaszuk/RJ_BS_eng/tree/main/code_snippets).
