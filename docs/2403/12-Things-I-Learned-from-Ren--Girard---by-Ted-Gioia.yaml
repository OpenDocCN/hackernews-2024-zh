- en: Some readers have noticed that I frequently praise René Girard (1923-2015),
    a critic and social theorist who has become eerily relevant in recent years—gaining
    tremendous influence since his death a decade ago.

    now, after his death, he is fashionable and trendy. It’s almost like some kind
    of punishment.

    Or social media pundits. Or even music critics like me.

    all places!—seem to explain so much of what’s taking place right now in society.

- en: When Girard writes about ancient Greek tragedy, he seems to be describing Instagram
    and social media. When he analyzes Flaubert or the *Book of Genesis*, he somehow
    explicates the current political situation. By looking at what’s old, he clarifies
    what’s new.

    Palo Alto. But I was a skeptic back then—especially because of his peculiar reliance
    on literature to explain sociology. Hence, I never took advantage of the opportunity
    to speak with him, much to my regret now.

    them in my own work. Nowadays I frequently rely on his ideas in analyzing situations
    and predicting future developments.

    and personal life. That’s why I want to share a quick guide to the insights I’ve

    my adaptations of his ideas. I need to do this because Girard rarely wrote about
    music (just a bit about opera), and never discussed popular culture, but I’ve
    found his concepts very useful in my work in both areas. (See, for example, my
    essay [“Why Do They Burn a Man at Burning Man?”](https://www.honest-broker.com/p/why-do-they-burn-a-man-at-burning))

- en: Imitation is such a childish motivation. We see toddlers doing it, or even animals
    at the zoo. People resist viewing themselves as imitators. They want to believe
    they’re more sophisticated than that—clinging to deeper explanations of their
    desires and behaviors.
  prefs: []

- en: It’s so much cooler to talk about our Freudian unconscious or Marxist class
    ideology or some other highfalutin theory. Girard cuts through this rhetoric.
    He exposes imitation (or “mimetic desire,” in his words) as pervasive in our lives—in
    our rituals, our institutions, our shopping and socializing, and (above) all in
    our violent passions.

    openly admit its power. They will never say that you’re just imitating your friends
    and neighbors, so they talk instead about fashion, trends, keeping up-to-date,
    etc. You will never see a single ad that openly proclaims: “Buy these running
    shoes because other people are doing it”—but that’s really the implicit message.'

    behind some other jargon. There are a hundred ways to hide mimetic desire, and
    these methods of deception are more powerful than we realize—because so much is
    at stake.

    Mimetic desire turns into mimetic rivalry—in everything from love to war. That’s
    the reason for the injunction against “coveting your neighbor’s wife.”

    You try to seize what your *neighbor desires most*. But this happens on a much
    larger scale in sociopolitical and economic conflicts. The truthteller has a special
    responsibility to expose imitative passion—because it is the force behind so much
    violence, persecution, and scapegoating.

    non-existent weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, creating a short-lived lull

    receiving special favors—and then they get executed. (I believe this helps us
    understand rock stars and other celebrities, who channel the same opposed impulses—think
    of the Rolling Stones at Altamont or the Sex Pistols at Winterland). The most
    intense emotions, both positive and negative, are targeted at these paradoxical
    figures. In many cultures, the victim who is offered in sacrifice even gets turn
    into a god—and thus originates a powerful ritual or myth.

    because that would destroy their own power base and purpose. Girard offers many
    other examples, drawn from history, mythology, literature, and religious texts.
    He shows that the scapegoat mechanism is the most powerful secret in the world—because
    it is both necessary to group formation, yet no hint of it can be acknowledged
    within the group.

    he is prevented from seeing his own complicity. “I am not aware of my own [scapegoating],”
    he confesses, “and I am persuaded that the same holds true for my readers. We
    only have legitimate enemies. And yet the entire universe swarms with scapegoats.”
    The persecutor is always *someone else*.

    in the human psyche. Our mimetic rivalry drives us to punish, and we resist even
    the slightest hint that our victim might be an innocent scapegoat.

    with the people we mimic—we want what they have, and vice versa. Even when we
    battle the other, it is usually because the differences between us are eroding.

    when both live in the same neighborhood and the barriers that previously existed
    have been removed. There are hundreds of other examples, but they all derive from
    *the other* refusing to remain *the other*, and instead showing up on our street,
    in our country club, at our doorstep, or somewhere else where they start to resemble
    us.

    more than difference itself. And nothing is more dangerous than total sameness.

    identical training and lifestyle regimens in their pursuit of it. Maybe years
    later, after both have retired from sports, this similarity can be recognized,
    but in the heat of the battle the opponent must be a hated enemy, standing for
    everything we abhor.

    are rich in implications for performers and critics. But consider the obvious
    example of dancing, where the pleasure (for both performer and audience) is intensified
    by the ritualized imitation of movement. I detect similar meanings everywhere
    in arts and entertainment—from jazz cutting sessions to youngsters imitating the
    hair styles of their favorite music stars.

    Rene Girard insists. But this knowledge is submerged in the rhetoric of vengeance,
    which is pervasive, and is the most destructive force in human society. Only by
    rejecting its propaganda, do we have a real chance to find harmonious ways of
    living together.

    to destroy the legitimacy of all scapegoating and violent reprisals. This is all
    the more important in the modern world, Girard warns, because our scapegoating
    rituals are losing their efficacy—it’s easy to see through their lies. Hence they
    no longer unify the public in a cathartic resolution. Meanwhile destructive technologies
    get more powerful and easy to access with each passing year.
