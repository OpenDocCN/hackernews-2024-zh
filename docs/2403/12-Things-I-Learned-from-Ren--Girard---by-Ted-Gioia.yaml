    they’re more sophisticated than that—clinging to deeper explanations of their
    desires and behaviors.

- en: It’s so much cooler to talk about our Freudian unconscious or Marxist class
    ideology or some other highfalutin theory. Girard cuts through this rhetoric.
    He exposes imitation (or “mimetic desire,” in his words) as pervasive in our lives—in
    our rituals, our institutions, our shopping and socializing, and (above) all in
    our violent passions.

    openly admit its power. They will never say that you’re just imitating your friends

    intense emotions, both positive and negative, are targeted at these paradoxical
