    unlike any other organism on the planet, those hardy critters known as tardigrades
    will only come back for more.

    key tardigrade proteins in human cells slowed metabolism, providing critical insights
    into how these [virtually indestructible invertebrates](https://www.sciencealert.com/tardigrades-are-practically-indestructible-but-climate-change-could-be-their-weak-point)

    to protect against extreme drying (desiccation). Through a variety of methods,
    the researchers showed how CAHS D transformed into a gel-like state when under
    stress, keeping molecules protected and protecting against drying.

    research that is [already underway](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-31586-9)
    with some studies looking at whether tardigrade proteins can stabilize important
    blood products used to treat genetic diseases. Early signs are promising in several
    areas, including the way the proteins are smartly activated when environmental
    stress is present, and deactivated when it isn't.
