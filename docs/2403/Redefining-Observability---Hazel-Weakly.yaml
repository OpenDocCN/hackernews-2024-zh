    a larger role in engineering strategy, I think the way it’s presented can often
    cause a lot of leaders to miss the value or to over-index on the wrong things.
    I’m going to present the current definitions of observability that are widely
    used in engineering and other disciplines, and then introduce my definition; I’ll
    also be going over what motivated me to develop my definition, and the deficiencies
    I encounter in the other definitions, especially when it comes to the failure
    modes of understanding.

    one, that definition should be usable both as a way to center understanding of
    a concept, but also to influence the direction in which you explore said concept,
    and guide you towards grasping all of the *implications* of said exploration.
    As an example, one of the problems I have with the control theory definition of
    observability is that it gives you absolutely zero idea of where to start, where
    you are, or how to get there. If your system is fully observable, and you *know*
    that it’s observable… Cool, awesome, that’s neat. The rest of us have no idea
    what the fuck is going on and would like a map of how to get there.

  zh: 对我来说，一个概念的良好定义的重点在于，当你有了一个定义时，它应该作为理解一个概念的中心方式，同时影响你探索该概念的方向，并指导你理解所有*相关的*探索的含义。举例来说，我对控制理论对可观测性的定义之一的问题是，它根本没有告诉你从哪里开始，你现在在哪里，或者如何到达目标。如果你的系统是完全可观测的，而且你*知道*它是可观测的……很酷，棒极了，这很好。但是我们其他人根本不知道发生了什么，并且希望有一张地图告诉我们如何到达那里。
- en: Another problem I have with the control theory definition of observability is
    that it completely removes the people from the equation; it doesn’t *literally*
    remove them, but you probably aren’t going to think about humans at all when you

    sounds like a people problem”? Probably not, and that’s an issue.
