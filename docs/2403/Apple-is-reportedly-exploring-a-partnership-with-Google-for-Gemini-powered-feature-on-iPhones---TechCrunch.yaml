- en: Apple is looking to team up with Google for a mega-deal to leverage the Gemini
    AI model for features on iPhone, [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-03-18/apple-in-talks-to-license-google-gemini-for-iphone-ios-18-generative-ai-tools)
    reported. This will put Google in a commanding position as the company already
    has a deal with Apple as the preferred search engine provider on iPhones for the
    Safari browser.

- en: The publication cited people familiar with the matter saying that Apple is looking
    to license Google’s AI tech to introduce AI-powered features with iOS updates
    later this year. Additionally, the company also held discussions with OpenAI to
    potentially use GPT models, Bloomberg said.

    field such as OpenAI, Microsoft, Anthropic and even Google. In February, Apple
    CEO Tim Cook said that the company will introduce [GenAI features “later this
    year.”](https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/02/apple-genai-on-way/)

    working on multiple internal and external tools powered by generative AI](https://techcrunch.com/2023/10/23/apples-job-listings-suggest-it-plans-to-infuse-ai-in-multiple-products/).
    However, talks of leveraging third-party AI tech means Apple hasn’t progressed
    as expected in its own AI efforts.

    iOS 18 software update — expected to be announced at the Worldwide Developer Conference
    (WWDC) historically held in June. However, the company is exploring partnering
    with an external provider for generative AI use cases such as image creation and
    helping users with writing.

- en: Google has had its own set of problems with Gemini. Last month, the company
    had to pause its image-generation feature after [the model created images with
    historical inaccuracies](https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/22/google-gemini-image-pause-people/).
    Later, Google CEO Sundar Pichai said that [Gemini’s responses were “completely
    unacceptable.”](https://www.semafor.com/article/02/27/2024/google-ceo-sundar-pichai-calls-ai-tools-responses-completely-unacceptable)
    Last week, Google said that it is blocking [election-related queries on Gemini](https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/12/google-gemini-election-related-queries/)
    across the globe. But TechCrunch found that users could get around those restrictions
    by introducing typos to some queries.

    features. Earlier this year, the company partnered with Samsung to introduce [Gemini-powered
    AI features on the Galaxy S24 series of devices](https://techcrunch.com/2024/01/17/samsungs-galaxy-s24-will-feature-google-gemini-powered-ai-features/).
    The search giant has also launched these features on its own Pixel series of phones.
