    again. The years straight after the death of Steve Jobs in 2011 were a trial by
    fire. First there was antitrust: America’s Department of Justice (DoJ) sued Apple
    for conspiring to fix e-book prices. Then there was competition: Samsung, a South
    Korean rival, went to war with the iPhone with bigger, sleeker models. Then came
    broader concerns. Apple’s new voice assistant, Siri, made rookie errors. Ditto
    Apple Maps, which went as far as relocating the Washington Monument to the Potomac
    river. At the time, the question hanging over the company was existential: could
    Apple’s creative spark survive the death of its founder? One of Mr Cook’s lieutenants
    was so miffed at the criticisms that he publicly retorted in 2013: “Can’t innovate
    any more, my ass!”'

    Asian competition, the existential question of innovation and growth—there are
    parallels between then and now. Competition watchdogs in the EU are demanding
    compliance from March 7th with rules that for the first time breach the “walled
    garden” which keeps users and developers bound within Apple’s playpen. On March
    4th they fined the company €1.8bn ($2bn) for allegedly stifling competition in
    music streaming. In America the DoJ may soon launch a case against Apple. In China,
    Huawei, a domestic mastodon, is seizing market share. Hanging over everything
    is the nagging concern, amid a levelling off in iPhone sales, that Mr Cook is
    missing the chance to pull another rabbit out of the hat with [generative artificial
    intelligence](https://www.economist.com/interactive/science-and-technology/2023/04/22/large-creative-ai-models-will-transform-how-we-live-and-work)
