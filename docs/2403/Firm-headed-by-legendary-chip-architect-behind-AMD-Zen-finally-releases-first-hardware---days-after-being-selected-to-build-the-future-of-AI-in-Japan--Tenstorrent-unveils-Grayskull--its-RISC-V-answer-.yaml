    behind [AMD](https://www.techradar.com/sg/tag/amd)'s Zen architecture and Tesla's
    original self-driving chip, has launched its first hardware. Grayskull is a RISC-V
    alternative to GPUs that is designed to be easier to program and scale, and reportedly
    excels at handling run-time sparsity and conditional computation.

    - the standard Grayskull e75 and the more powerful Grayskull e150\. Both are inference-only
    hardware designed for AI development, and come with TT-Buda and TT-Metalium software.
    The former is for running models right away, while the latter is for users who
    want to customize their models or write new ones.
