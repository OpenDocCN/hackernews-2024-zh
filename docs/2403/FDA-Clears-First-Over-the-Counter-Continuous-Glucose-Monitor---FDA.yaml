- en: Today, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration cleared for marketing the first
    over-the-counter (OTC) continuous glucose monitor (CGM). The Dexcom Stelo Glucose
    Biosensor System is an integrated CGM (iCGM) intended for anyone 18 years and
    older who does not use insulin, such as individuals with diabetes treating their
    condition with oral medications, or those without diabetes who want to better
    understand how diet and exercise may impact blood sugar levels. Importantly, this
    system is not for individuals with problematic hypoglycemia (low blood sugar)
    as the system is not designed to alert the user to this potentially dangerous
    condition.

    expands access to these devices by allowing individuals to purchase a CGM without
    the involvement of a health care provider,” said Jeff Shuren, M.D., J.D., director
    of the FDA’s Center for Devices and Radiological Health. “Giving more individuals
    valuable information about their health, regardless of their access to a doctor
    or health insurance, is an important step forward in advancing health equity for
    U.S. patients.”**'

- en: The Stelo Glucose Biosensor System uses a wearable sensor, paired with an application
    installed on a user’s smartphone or other smart device, to continuously measure,
    record, analyze and display glucose values in people 18 years and older that are
    not on insulin and who do not have problematic hypoglycemia. Users can wear each
    sensor up to 15 days before replacing with a new sensor. The device presents blood
    glucose measurements and trends every 15 minutes in the accompanying app. Users
    should not make medical decisions based on the device’s output without talking
    to their healthcare provider.

    similarly to other iCGMs. Adverse events reported in the study included local
    infection, skin irritation and pain or discomfort.

    protects the public health by assuring the safety, effectiveness, and security
    of human and veterinary drugs, vaccines and other biological products for human
    use, and medical devices. The agency also is responsible for the safety and security
    of our nation’s food supply, cosmetics, dietary supplements, products that give
