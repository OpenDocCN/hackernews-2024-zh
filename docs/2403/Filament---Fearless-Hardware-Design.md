# Filament | Fearless Hardware Design

> 来源：[https://filamenthdl.com/](https://filamenthdl.com/)

## Composable Filament uses a new kind of type system to ensure that when you use a module to perform a computation, it's timing constraints, like latency and initiation interval are correct. When there are errors, it generates helpful error messages to explain what is wrong with the design!

## Efficient Filament's type system does the heavy lifting to ensure that your modules compose correctly. After that, the compiler erases the types and generates Verilog that is as efficient as hand-written code.

## Integrable Filament makes it easy to integrate black-box Verilog module: just give them a type signature and the compiler will ensure that they are used correctly! Similarly, Filament is easy to integrate in Verilog projects; the compiler generates clean SystemVerilog code that compiles with open-source and commercial tools.
