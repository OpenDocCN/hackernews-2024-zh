- en: Following that buy, MicroStrategy's stack stood at 205,000 bitcoins, now worth
    just shy of $15 billion. Assuming bitcoin remains around its current $73,000 level,
    the company would be able to purchase somewhere in area of 6,800 addition tokens
    with proceeds from this latest offering.
