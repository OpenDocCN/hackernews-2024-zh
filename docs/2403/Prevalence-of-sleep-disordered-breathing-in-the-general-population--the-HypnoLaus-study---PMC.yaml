- en: Sleep-disordered breathing is associated with major morbidity and mortality.
    However, its prevalence has mainly been selectively studied in populations at
    risk for sleep-disordered breathing or cardiovascular diseases. Taking into account
    improvements in recording techniques and new criteria used to define respiratory
    events, we aimed to assess the prevalence of sleep-disordered breathing and associated
    clinical features in a large population-based sample.

    in Lausanne, Switzerland. We invited a cohort of 3043 consecutive participants
    of the CoLaus/PsyCoLaus study to take part. Polysomnography data from 2121 people
    were included in the final analysis. 1024 (48%) participants were men, with a
    median age of 57 years (IQR 49–68, range 40–85) and mean body-mass index (BMI)
    of 25·6 kg/m² (SD 4·1). Participants underwent complete polysomnographic recordings
    at home and had extensive phenotyping for diabetes, hypertension, metabolic syndrome,
    and depression. The primary outcome was prevalence of sleep-disordered breathing,
    assessed by the apnoea-hypopnoea index.

    and 14·9 per h (7·2–27·1) in men. The prevalence of moderate-to-severe sleep-disordered
    breathing (≥15 events per h) was 23·4% (95% CI 20·9–26·0) in women and 49·7% (46·6–52·8)
    in men. After multivariable adjustment, the upper quartile for the apnoea-hypopnoea
    index (>20·6 events per h) was associated independently with the presence of hypertension
    (odds ratio 1·60, 95% CI 1·14–2·26; p=0·0292 for trend across severity quartiles),
    diabetes (2·00, 1·05–3·99; p=0·0467), metabolic syndrome (2·80, 1·86–4·29; p<0·0001),
    and depression (1·92, 1·01–3·64; p=0·0292).

- en: The high prevalence of sleep-disordered breathing recorded in our population-based
    sample might be attributable to the increased sensitivity of current recording
    techniques and scoring criteria. These results suggest that sleep-disordered breathing
    is highly prevalent, with important public health outcomes, and that the definition
    of the disorder should be revised.

- en: 'Sleep-disordered breathing is a chronic disorder caused by repeated upper-airway
    collapse during sleep, resulting in recurrent nocturnal asphyxia, fragmented sleep,
    major fluctuations in blood pressure, and increased sympathetic nervous system
    activity.^([1](#R1)) Furthermore, patients with untreated sleep-disordered breathing
    are at increased risk of hypertension, stroke, heart failure, diabetes, car accidents,
    and depression.^([2](#R2)–[9](#R9)) Polysomnography is the gold standard to diagnose
    sleep-disordered breathing. However, despite the important effect of sleep-disordered
    breathing on public health, only a few attempts have been made to screen the general
    population for this disorder using polysomnography. In the late 1980s and early
    1990s, three large cohort studies were done in the USA: the Wisconsin Sleep Cohort
    Study,^([10](#R10)) the Sleep Heart Health Study,^([11](#R11)) and the Penn State
    Cohort.^([12](#R12)) From these studies, the prevalence of sleep-disordered breathing—defined
    by an apnoea-hypopnoea index greater than five events per h—was estimated to be
    between 6·5% and 9% in women and between 17% and 31% in men.^([10](#R10),[12](#R12))
    However, this prevalence has since been revised to around 34% in men aged 30–70
    years and 17% in women aged 30–70 years.^([13](#R13)) Although these studies provide
    important epidemiological data, they included an enriched selection of people
    at risk for sleep-disordered breathing (based on questionnaires) or cardiovascular
    disease. Therefore, the prevalence of sleep-disordered breathing could not be
    measured directly but was estimated through complex statistical calculations with
    reference to other population-based studies.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Researchers on subsequent epidemiological studies have either selected specific
    ethnic groups^([14](#R14),[15](#R15)) or high-risk populations.^([16](#R16)) To
    record nocturnal breathing, all except a few^([13](#R13),[17](#R17)) used less
    sensitive technology (eg, pen and paper recorders, thermocouples, or respiratory
    inductive plethysmography)^([16](#R16),[18](#R18)) than nasal pressure technology,
    which is now the standard of care. Furthermore, pulse oximeters have improved
    considerably over the years. Both technical developments have increased sensitivity
    for diagnosis of sleep-disordered breathing. Moreover, the American Academy of
    Sleep Medicine (AASM) has revised criteria used to define nocturnal respiratory
    events.^([19](#R19)–[21](#R21)) Because most clinical settings now use recording
    techniques with increased sensitivity and the new definitions for respiratory
    events, the prevalence of sleep-disordered breathing and its association with
    important health outcomes needs to be revisited.

    by examining its associations with cardiovascular, metabolic, and psychiatric

    CoLaus/PsyCoLaus cohort study, described previously.^([22](#R22),[23](#R23)) Briefly,
    the CoLaus/PsyCoLaus study was undertaken between 2003 and 2006 and included a
    sample of 6733 people aged 35–75 years, who were selected at random (using Stata
    version 9.1) from the population register of the city of Lausanne, Switzerland
    (altitude approximately 490 m).^([22](#R22)) The distribution of age groups, sex,
    and postal codes in CoLaus/PsyCoLaus participants was representative of the source
    population.^([22](#R22)) The original aim of the CoLaus/PsyCoLaus cohort study
    was to investigate the prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors and psychiatric
    disorders in the general population and to identify genetic determinants and mechanisms

    who were willing to return underwent a second physical (n=5064) and psychiatric
    (n=4001) examination and were given questionnaires by trained interviewers. These
    assessments included questions on their demographic, medical, and treatment history,
    and smoking and alcohol consumption. Sleep-related complaints and habits were
    investigated using the Pittsburgh sleep quality index, the Epworth sleepiness
    scale, and the Berlin questionnaire for sleep-disordered breathing. Blood samples
    were taken in the fasting state and a large panel of biological variables was
    measured.^([24](#R24)) Selection of participants for the HypnoLaus Sleep Cohort

    sleep-disordered breathing. They equipped participants with a polysomnographic
    recorder (Titanium, Embla Flaga, Reykjavik, Iceland) between 1700 h and 2000 h
    at the Center for Investigation and Research in Sleep at the University Hospital
    of Lausanne. All sleep recordings took place in the patients’ home environment
    in accordance with 2007 AASM recommended setup specifications.^([19](#R19)) We
    recorded breathing using nasal pressure sensors. We asked individuals who were
    currently receiving treatment for sleep-disordered breathing (n=38) to discontinue
    their treatment 1 week before the sleep recording.

- en: Two trained sleep technicians (DA and NT) who were unaware of the results of
    the previous questionnaires scored polysomnographic recordings manually using
    Somnologica software (version 5.1.1, Embla Flaga, Reykjavik, Iceland). An expert
    sleep clinician (JH-R) reviewed every recording and a second sleep expert (RH)
    did random quality checks. Quality control for concordance between the two polysomnography
    scorers was implemented periodically to ensure that both technicians achieved
    at least 90% agreement for sleep stages and respiratory events and an 85% level
    of agreement for arousals.^([25](#R25)) We scored sleep stages and arousals according
    to 2007 AASM recommendations.^([19](#R19)) We defined apnoea as a drop of at least
    90% of airflow from baseline lasting 10 s or longer. We initially scored hypopnoea
    events using 1999 AASM Chicago criteria,^([20](#R20)) but all recordings were
    rescored using the more restrictive 2007 AASM criteria^([19](#R19)) and the more
    liberal 2012 AASM criteria^([21](#R21)) (≥30% drop of airflow lasting at least
    10 s with either an arousal or ≥3% oxygen saturation drop). We used the 2012 criteria
    for our analysis (because they are the most recent and currently recommended criteria)
    and reported the average number of apnoea and hypopnoea events per h of sleep
    (the apnoea-hypopnoea index). We defined sleep-disordered breathing with usual
    clinical thresholds (ie, no sleep-disordered breathing, <5 events per h; mild,
    ≥5 to <15 events per h; moderate, ≥15 to <30 events per h; and severe, ≥30 events
    per h). The [appendix (p 4)](#FN2) shows apnoea-hypopnoea index scores using 1999
    and 2007 criteria.^([19](#R19),[20](#R20)) We defined excessive daytime sleepiness
    as an Epworth score greater than ten (maximum score 24).

    of sleep-disordered breathing with cardiovascular, metabolic, and psychiatric
    comorbidities. We measured blood pressure three times on the left arm and calculated
    the average of the last two readings. We defined arterial hypertension as either
    systolic blood pressure of 140 mm Hg or higher, diastolic blood pressure of 90
    mm Hg or higher, or current use of antihypertensive drugs. We calculated the waist-to-hip
    ratio as the ratio of the circumference of the waist to that of the hip, as recommended
    by WHO. We measured neck circumference between the mid-cervical spine and the
    mid-anterior neck, just below the laryngeal prominence, if palpable. We obtained
    a fasting blood sample for various analyses, including measurement of glucose
    concentration and lipids. We defined diabetes as either fasting blood glucose
    of 7 mmol/L or higher or current drug treatment for diabetes. We defined metabolic
    syndrome according to the Adult Treatment Panel III (ATP-III) report.^([26](#R26))
    Participants self-reported their alcohol drinking habits and the number of alcoholic
    drinks taken during the evening preceding the polysomnographic recording. We used
    the semi-structured Diagnostic Interview for Genetic Studies to diagnose a current
    major depressive episode, which we defined according to criteria of the Diagnostic
    and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition (DSM-IV).

    CI), mean (SD), and median (IQR). We did bivariate analyses with the χ² test,
    Student’s *t* test, or Wilcoxon’s rank-sum test. We used Cohen’s *d* to calculate
    the effect size of the differences between participants who underwent polysomnography
    and those who did not. We used logistic regression models to assess the association
    between various demographic and clinical variables and both mild-to-severe sleep-disordered
    breathing (≥5 events per h on the apnoea-hypopnoea index) and moderate-to-severe
    sleep-disordered breathing (≥15 per h on the apnoea-hypopnoea index), in men and
    women. To estimate the association between severity of sleep-disordered breathing
    and risk of diabetes, hypertension, metabolic syndrome, and depression, we used
    logistic regression models and divided our sample into quartiles of apnoea-hypopnoea
    index (Q1, 0–4·2 events per h; Q2, 4·3–9·9 events per h; Q3, 10·0–20·6 per h;
    Q4, >20·6 events per h). We compared models with the likelihood ratio test.

    event (75%), followed by obstructive sleep apnoea (19%), central apnoea (4%),
    and mixed apnoea (2%). To assess a possible first-night effect, the first 20 participants
    underwent two consecutive polysomnographic recordings at home. The type and severity

    was recorded in 858 (83·8%; 95% CI 81·4–86·0) men and 667 (60·8%; 57·8–63·7) women,

    breathing, we divided our population into two age categories, younger than 60
    years and 60 years or older, which is roughly the median age of the total participants.
    Moderate-to-severe sleep-disordered breathing increased significantly in older
    participants compared with those in the younger age group, but this difference

    the prevalence of sleep-disordered breathing in a population-based sample using
    the most recent polysomnographic recording techniques and scoring criteria. We
    recorded a much higher than previously estimated prevalence of sleep-disordered
    breathing and an independent association between the disorder and diabetes, hypertension,
    metabolic syndrome, and depression, albeit mainly in the highest severity quartile
    of the apnoea-hypopnoea index (>20·6 events per h).

- en: The first report of prevalence of sleep-disordered breathing was published 20
    years ago by Young and colleagues^([10](#R10)) and was based on the Wisconsin
    Cohort Study (WSCS). In a follow-up of WSCS, increased prevalence estimates were
    reported.^([13](#R13)) However, the earlier study was not strictly population-based
    because it included an enriched selection of people at risk for sleep-disordered
    breathing (panel). The reported prevalence of sleep-disordered breathing was,
    thus, estimated using models extrapolating the observed results to the general
    US population using demographic data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination
    Survey (NHANES) study.
  prefs: []

- en: The high prevalence of sleep-disordered breathing recorded in our cohort could
    be accounted for by two factors. First, we measured the prevalence of sleep-disordered
    breathing directly in the general population rather than estimating it; and second,
    we used currently recommended techniques (including nasal pressure sensors) and
    scoring criteria. To date, only two studies based directly on samples from the
    general population have been done.^([17](#R17),[18](#R18)) In both studies, researchers
    reported a high prevalence of sleep-disordered breathing. In a study from Spain
    of 2148 individuals aged 30–70 years,^([18](#R18)) the prevalence of sleep-disordered
    breathing (apnoea-hypopnoea index >5 events per h) was 26·2% in men and 28·0%
    in women. However, full polysomnography was only used in a subset of 390 participants,
    and most participants were studied with limited channels recorders without direct
    airflow measurement, which does not match current standards.^([21](#R21)) In a
    study from Brazil of 1042 participants aged 20–80 years,^([17](#R17)) the latest
    breathing sensors were used to measure variation in nasal pressure (which is the
    technique currently used in all modern clinical laboratories). The researchers
    reported a high prevalence of sleep-disordered breathing (apnoea-hypopnoea index
    >5 events per h) of 46·6% in men and 30·5% in women; however, these results were
    obtained in a specific mixed ethnic population and are difficult to generalise
    to other populations.

- en: The findings of these studies and ours suggest that the prevalence of sleep-disordered
    breathing is highly dependent on technical factors. Nasal pressure sensors detect
    subtle breathing variations, resulting in detection of more hypopnoea events (and,
    therefore, a higher apnoea-hypopnoea index) than with thermistors, which have
    decreased sensitivity ([appendix p 2](#FN2)).^([27](#R27),[28](#R28)) The 2012
    AASM criteria^([21](#R21)) propose a more liberal definition of hypopnoea, whereas
    more strict definitions were used in previous studies. Although this change in
    definition might partly account for the increased prevalence of sleep-disordered
    breathing in our study, prevalence was still higher than previously reported after
    rescoring the polysomnographic recordings using the older and more restrictive
    criteria ([appendix p 4](#FN2)).

- en: In our study, clinical and epidemiological factors associated with sleep-disordered
    breathing were increasing age, male sex, large neck circum ference, obesity, and
    reported snoring, similar to previous studies.^([10](#R10),[12](#R12),[29](#R29))
    The difference in prevalence of sleep-disordered breathing between men and women
    seemed to diminish in participants aged 60 years or older, probably because of
    the increased proportion of postmenopausal women in this age category, who had
    a higher median apnoea-hypopnoea index compared with premenopausal women. Even
    though women and men with an apnoea-hypopnoea index of 15 or more events per h
    had a similar BMI, women had a lower neck circumference and waist-to-hip ratio
    compared with men. This finding confirms that not only central obesity but also

    diabetes, hypertension, metabolic syndrome, and depression were noted after multivariable
    adjustment. This finding suggests that we identified a clinically important disease
    rather than simply over-diagnosing healthy individuals. These results accord with
    findings of the WSCS,^([2](#R2)) in which sleep-disordered breathing was associated
    prospectively with hypertension, a result confirmed by later observational and
    interventional studies.^([30](#R30),[31](#R31)) Moreover, a prospective association
    with depression has been reported previously.^([8](#R8)) Diabetes seems to have
    a bidirectional association with sleep-disordered breathing: intermittent hypoxaemia
    contributes to development of insulin resistance and glucose intolerance, and
    type 2 diabetes increases an individual’s predisposition to sleep-disordered breathing.^([9](#R9),[32](#R32),[33](#R33))
    However, fewer reports have been published of an association between sleep-disordered
    breathing and metabolic syndrome.^([34](#R34))'

- en: In previous studies, even sleep-disordered breathing of the lowest severity
    (apnoea-hypopnoea index >5 events per h) was associated with hypertension^([2](#R2),[18](#R18))
    or depression.^([8](#R8)) However, we noted these associations mostly in the upper
    quartile of severity (apnoea-hypopnoea index >20·6 events per h). Since current
    recording techniques and scoring criteria are more sensitive than those used previously,
    this finding strongly suggests that the definition of sleep-disordered breathing
    should be revised. Indeed, in our study, almost every individual had some degree
    of sleep-disordered breathing, and an increasing apnoea-hypopnoea index was associated
    with augmented prevalence of comorbid diseases. These results reinforce the idea
    that, instead of using the arbitrary diagnostic threshold of the apnoea-hypopnoea
    index, sleep-disordered breathing should be considered as a disease characterised
    by a severity spectrum, akin to blood pressure or cholesterol levels. Treatment
    of sleep-disordered breathing should, thus, be increasingly aggressive with rising
    apnoea-hypopnoea index, particularly in individuals with risk factors for comorbidities
    associated with sleep-disordered breathing, such as sleepiness, cardiovascular
    disease, metabolic disease, and depression. Treatments will ultimately be guided
    by appropriately designed clinical trials, but individuals with a low apnoea-hypopnoea
    index and at low risk for comorbidities could be treated conservatively to reduce
    risk factors for sleep-disordered breathing (eg, weight control or avoiding sleep
    in the supine position), whereas individuals at higher risk could benefit from
    continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), mandibular advancement devices, and
    surgery (eg, maxillomandibular advancement surgery) in selected cases. This rational
    approach to sleep-disordered breathing is implemented de facto by skilled clinicians;
    however, our results emphasise the importance of dedicating health care resources
    to individuals at high risk of complications rather than initiating treatment
    based on an apnoea-hypopnoea index threshold. Ultimately, follow-up of the HypnoLaus
    cohort will allow us to identify individuals at high risk of incident complications
    (eg, using biological or genetic markers) and will help to provide therapeutic
    recommendations in an individualised manner.

    sample, enabling extrapolation of findings to the original population. Moreover,
    poly somnographic recordings were done in the participant’s home environment,
    thus minimising the likelihood of information bias. Finally, modern recording
    techniques and scoring criteria were applied, which ensures validity of results
    in view of current recommendations.^([21](#R21))

- en: The main limitations of our study are the cross-sectional setting and the inclusion
    of individuals aged 40–85 years old only, almost exclusively of white European
    origin and with a low prevalence of obesity. Thus, generalisation of findings
    to younger people, to populations with a high prevalence of obesity, or to people
    from other ethnic backgrounds is limited. For example, the average BMI is lower
    in Switzerland than in the USA, suggesting that the prevalence of sleep-disordered
    breathing could be higher in a North American population. Second, 29% of participants
    declined to have polysomnography, which might have caused selection bias. However,
    since the HypnoLaus sample was similar in terms of age, sex, BMI, and ethnic origin
    to the CoLaus/PsyCoLaus cohort, which is representative of Lausanne’s general
    population, we believe that our results are probably very close to the true prevalence
    of sleep-disordered breathing in the general population. Finally, a variable time
    gap existed between clinical assessment of participants and polysomnography, but
    it probably did not affect the association between severity of sleep-disordered
    breathing and diabetes, hypertension, metabolic syndrome, and depression, since
    these disorders are typically chronic conditions.

- en: The prevalence of sleep-disordered breathing in the general population is considerably
    higher than previously reported when the most recent recording techniques and
    scoring criteria are used. Caution is thus needed when comparing the prevalence
    of sleep-disordered breathing with previous studies in which different sampling
    frames, recording techniques, and scoring criteria were used. These results, and
    the progressive association between severity of sleep-disordered breathing and
    cardiovascular, metabolic, and psychiatric diseases, suggest that an arbitrary
    threshold for the apnoea-hypopnoea index could be hard to define and clinical
    decisions might need a complete clinical picture to be well informed.

- en: We searched PubMed up to October, 2014, with the terms “sleep apnea”, “sleep
    apnoea”, or “sleep disordered breathing”, and “prevalence”. After exclusion of
    studies that did not include objective nocturnal measurements, we retrieved 21
    epidemiological studies assessing the prevalence of sleep-disordered breathing
    in different populations. Results of epidemiological studies done in the late
    1980s and 1990s showed a rather low prevalence of sleep-disordered breathing,
    probably due to low sensitivity of recording techniques.^([10](#R10),[12](#R12))
    These and almost all subsequent studies included population samples selected or
    enriched with individuals presenting risk factors for sleep-disordered breathing
    or cardiovascular disease, and were thus not representative of the general population.
    Therefore, statistical corrections were needed to estimate the prevalence of sleep-disordered
    breathing in the general population in those studies. Another important factor
    affecting prevalence of sleep-disordered breathing is the definition of respiratory
    events, which strongly affects the apnoea-hypopnoea index (^([appendix p 4](#FN2))).
    Since these definitions were updated in 2012, none of the previous epidemiological
    studies could use the up-to-date definition of respiratory events.

- en: Using the most recent definitions for respiratory events, and diagnostic techniques
    commonly used in all modern sleep laboratories, we noted that almost every individual
    had some degree of sleep-disordered breathing. Moreover, an increasing number
    of apnoea and hypopnoea events per h was associated with augmented comorbidity.
    This finding reinforces the idea that sleep-disordered breathing should be considered
    as a disease with a continuous spectrum, rather than as a definite yes or no diagnosis.
    Individuals at high risk of incident sleep-disordered breathing-related complications
    should be identified so treatment efforts can be focused on them.
