- en: Harvard Library has removed human skin from the binding of a copy of Arsène
    Houssaye’s book *Des destinées de l’âme* (1880s), held at Houghton Library. The
    volume’s first owner, French physician and bibliophile Dr. Ludovic Bouland (1839–1933),
    bound the book with skin he took without consent from the body of a deceased female
    patient in a hospital where he worked. The book has been in the collections of
    Harvard Library since 1934, initially placed on deposit by John B. Stetson, Jr.
    (1884–1952), an American diplomat, businessman, and Harvard alumnus (AB 1906),
    and later through donation by his widow Ruby F. Stetson to Houghton Library in
    1954\.

- en: The removal of the human skin from *Des destinées de l’âme* follows a review
    by Houghton Library of the book’s stewardship, prompted by the recommendations
    of the [*Report of the Harvard University Steering Committee on Human Remains
    in University Museum Collections*](https://provost.harvard.edu/files/provost/files/harvard_university-_human_remains_report_fall_2022.pdf?m=1663090982)
    issued in fall 2022\. After careful study, stakeholder engagement, and consideration,
    Harvard Library and the Harvard Museum Collections Returns Committee concluded
    that the human remains used in the book’s binding no longer belong in the Harvard
    Library collections, due to the ethically fraught nature of the book’s origins
    and subsequent history. The Library is now in the process of conducting additional
    provenance and biographical research into the book, Bouland, and the anonymous
    female patient, as well as consulting with appropriate authorities at the University
    and in France to determine a final respectful disposition of these human remains.

- en: In the course of its review, the library noted several ways in which its stewardship
    practices failed to meet the level of ethical standards to which it subscribes.
    Until relatively recently, the library has made the book available to anyone who
    asked for it, regardless of their reason for wishing to consult it. Library lore
    suggests that decades ago, students employed to page collections in Houghton’s
    stacks were hazed by being asked to retrieve the book without being told it included
    human remains. In 2014, following the scientific analysis that confirmed the book
    to be bound in human skin, the library published posts on the Houghton blog that
    utilized a sensationalistic, morbid, and humorous tone that fueled similar international
    media coverage.
