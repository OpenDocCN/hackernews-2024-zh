    goodbye to your loved ones. That you can recreate them virtually so you can have
    conversations and find out how they’re feeling.

    a hologram of her [dead father](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-54731382),
    Robert Kardashian. Reportedly, Kim Kardashian reacted with disbelief and joy to
    the [virtual appearance](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/oct/30/robert-kardashian-resurrected-as-a-hologram-for-kim-kardashian-wests-birthday)

    loved one, moving and talking again might offer comfort to those left behind.

- en: As a psychotherapist researching how AI technology can be used to enhance therapeutic
    interventions, I’m intrigued by the advent of ghostbots. But I’m also more than
    a little concerned about the potential effects of this technology on the mental
    health of those using it, especially those who are grieving. Resurrecting dead
    people as avatars has the potential to cause more harm than good, perpetuating
    even more confusion, stress, depression, paranoia and, in some cases, psychosis.

    grief”](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/15524256.2020.1745726). In
    some extreme cases, a person may experience apparitions [and hallucinate](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1363461520962887)
    that they see the dead person and begin to believe they are alive. AI ghostbots
    could further traumatise someone experiencing complicated grief and may exacerbate
    associated problems such as hallucinations.
