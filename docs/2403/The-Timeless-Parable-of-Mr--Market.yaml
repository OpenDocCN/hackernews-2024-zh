    who has used to to make billions of dollars and remain calm when all around him
    [were losing their heads](https://fs.blog/2012/12/how-to-be-a-man-rudyard-kipling/).

    the mental attitude toward market fluctuations that I believe to be most conducive
    to investment success. He said that you should imagine market quotations as coming
    from a remarkably accommodating fellow named Mr. Market who is your partner in
    a private business. Without fail, Mr. Market appears daily and names a price at
    which he will either buy your interest or sell you his.

    that are stable, Mr. Market’s quotations will be anything but. For, sad to say,
    the poor fellow has incurable emotional problems. At times he feels euphoric and
    can see only the favorable factors affecting the business. When in that mood,
    he names a very high buy-sell price because he fears that you will snap up his
    interest and rob him of imminent gains. At other times he is depressed and can
    see nothing but trouble ahead for both the business and the world. On these occasions,
    he will name a very low price, since he is terrified that you will unload your
    interest on him.

    If his quotation is uninteresting to you today, he will be back with a new one
    tomorrow. Transactions are strictly at your option. Under these conditions, the
    more manic-depressive his behavior, the better for you.'

    turn into pumpkins and mice: Mr. Market is there to serve you, not to guide you.
    It is his pocketbook, not his wisdom, that you will find useful. If he shows up
    some day in a particularly foolish mood, you are free to either ignore him or
    to take advantage of him, but it will be disastrous if you fall under his influence.
    Indeed, if you aren’t certain that you understand and can value your business
    far better than Mr. Market, you don’t belong in the game. As they say in poker,
    “If you’ve been in the game 30 minutes and you don’t know who the patsy is, you’re
    the patsy.”'

    in which most professionals and academicians talk of efficient markets, dynamic
    hedging and betas. Their interest in such matters is understandable, since techniques
    shrouded in mystery clearly have value to the purveyor of investment advice. After
    all, what witch doctor has ever achieved fame and fortune by simply advising “Take
    two aspirins”?

    story. In my opinion, investment success will not be produced by arcane formulae,
    computer programs or signals flashed by the price behavior of stocks and markets.
    Rather an investor will succeed by coupling good business judgment with an ability
    to insulate his thoughts and behavior from the super-contagious emotions that
    swirl about the marketplace. In my own efforts to stay insulated, I have found
    it highly useful to keep Ben’s Mr. Market concept firmly in mind.

    by their operating results – not by their daily, or even yearly, price quotations
    – whether our investments are successful. The market may ignore business success
    for a while, but eventually will confirm it. As Ben said: “**In the short run,
    the market is a voting machine but in the long run it is a weighing machine**.”
    The speed at which a business’s success is recognized, furthermore, is not that
    important as long as the company’s intrinsic value is increasing at a satisfactory
    rate. In fact, delayed recognition can be an advantage: It may give us the chance
    to buy more of a good thing at a bargain price.'
