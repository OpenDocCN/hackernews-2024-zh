    need to be able to put their hand up and say, hey, pick me!

    aren’t already installed (or approved) on my phone. Discovery will be key.

- en: We’ll have (semi-)autonomous AI agents – *we have the first ones already and
    they look pretty promising. There will be many more once GPT-5-equiv models are
    out*

- en: We’ll have personal AI agents – *again, the first is about to hit the market,
    and there are trust/product issues but these are solveable*
  id: totrans-split-124
  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We’ll need precision in how agents answer requests – *highly plausible, in the
    same way that you might prefer Waze over Apple Maps for routing, or Resy over
    Yelp for finding a place to eat*

- en: We’ll achieve this in the exact same way that we meet the challenge with phones
    – *user preferences are basically “vibe” and this is expressed as “brand” for
    an “app” in the phone world. The skeuomorph of that app squircle isn’t going away,
    that’s my take, the “there from here” challenge is insurmountable otherwise. Plausible?*

- en: Although apps might not go anywhere, we’ll need new kinds of search engines
    for the agents to query – *maybe this will be called an index, or a store, but
    we’ll need some combination of query and signals, for sure*
  id: totrans-split-127

- en: There will be a global index of available tools, and my AI agent will pro-actively
    offer me new ones drawn from this index, in addition to using ones that I’ve already
    “installed”.

    it’ll play out?

    I see it.

    and ranking technologies.** That’s a key enabler.'
