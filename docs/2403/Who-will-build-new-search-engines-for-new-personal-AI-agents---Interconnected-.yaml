  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    like this…
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The definition of an “agent” is an autonomous AI that has access to “tools”.
    A tool is something like a web browser, or a calculator, or integration with a
    booking system, anything with an API (a machine interface).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Then you know the way that ChatGPT has a turn-taking interaction, human then
    AI, human then AI, etc? Agents are different. You give the AI a goal, then you
    tell it to choose for itself which tool to use to get it closer to its goal…
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: …and then you run it again, in a loop, automatically, until the AI says that
    it’s done.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'So with our toy example above, the loops might look something like:'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The AI “thinks” *to get closer to my goal, I need a list of bars and restaurants
    in Peckham. The web search tool will do for that* – so now it has a list of places,
    and we loop again
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The AI “thinks” *to get closer to my goal, I need to know if each of these places
    is open and if they have any events tonight. The web search tool will do for that
    again* – so now it has a shorter list of places, and we loop again
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The AI “thinks” *to get closer to my goal, I need to present these to Matt and
    ask which one to book. I can use the “ask the user” tool for that* – so now we
    interact.
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And totally works! With today’s technology! It’s really simple to build.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You can embellish the basic looping pattern. Agents can retain context between
    sessions, i.e. the user Matt prefers some types of bars and not others. That’s
    part of what makes an agent *personal.*

    resources than a response in ChatGPT. The enabler a year ago was on 1 Mar 2023
    when OpenAI shipped the model `gpt-3.5-turbo` with a 10x price drop. But honestly
    agents are barely reliable with that model… you need GPT-4-equivalent or above,
    and that’s gonna cost you.'
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**They’re divergent.** If you give an agent even a slightly open-ended task,
    it can end up doing bizarre things. For instance, I have an agent that’ll tell
    me the weather, and to perform that task it first asks me for my location. Once
    I pretended I didn’t know, so it went off and started googling for how I could
    install an app to give me my lat-long, etc.'
  prefs:
