    descent (SGD) is a variant of GD. For GD, the gradients are computed by passing
    through the entire training set before taking a step. SGD uses one sample - drawn
    randomly from the training set hence the term stochastic. Batch GD uses a greater
    than 1 sample but not all samples to compute gradients.
