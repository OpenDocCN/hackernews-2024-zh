- en: My favorite phenomenon in digital circuitry is when digital threatens to become
    analog again. For example, a lot of people are interested in the idea of overclocking
    an FPGA for more performance and are usually encouraged not to do so. However,
    thinking about the reasons why overclocking goes wrong and learning to understand
    the issues with overclocking can allow you to achieve a stable overclock or at
    least help you understand your chip better. This is only one example of exploring
    odd behavior of FPGAs when pushing beyond suggested limits.

    why FPGAs are often sold with speed grades or speed bins with faster dies being
    sold for more. CPUs used for overclocking may be called lucky samples or golden
    chips to denote their exceptional performance when the chip is pushed to the limit.
    Within a speed grade or product category, chips still exhibit variation. The bins
    are simply not granular enough to capture all possible outcomes of a manufacturing
    process. A good sample may exhibit lower leakage, resulting in lower static power,
    or lower propagation delay.

    of a digital circuit when voltage is increased, propagation delay decreases. Silicon
    chips also draw power relative to the square of the voltage, therefore, small
    increases in voltage can result in significant increases in power consumption
    and as a result, heat generation. The reverse is true when voltage is decreased.
    Electron migration increases with higher voltage and dielectric breakdown could
    occur as well which can result in destruction of the chip.

    rising or falling edges of input signals are observed. The problem with this approach
