    found that more of Earth's water is held underground in the soil or in pores in
    rock — known as groundwater — than in Earth's ice caps and glaciers.

    about 720,000 cubic miles (3 million cubic km); and in glaciers outside of Antarctica
    and Greenland, 38,000 cubic miles (158,000 cubic km), the 2021 study noted.

    312 million cubic miles (1.3 billion cubic km), according to the 2021 study. Still,
    aside from the oceans, groundwater is the largest reservoir of water globally,
    the study noted.

    had estimated there were 5.4 million cubic miles (22.6 million cubic km) of shallow
    groundwater — water in the upper 1.2 miles (2 kilometers) of Earth's crust. In
    contrast, the 2021 study considered groundwater within the upper 6.2 miles (10
    km) of Earth's crust, Ferguson said.

- en: This discrepancy was due to how previous estimates of deep groundwater — that
    below the upper 1.2 miles of Earth's crust — focused only on crystalline rocks
    with low porosity, such as granite. The 2021 study included sedimentary rocks,
    which are more porous than crystalline rocks.

    to exist 1.2 to 6.2 miles beneath Earth's surface — from about 2 million cubic
    miles (8.5 million cubic km) to 4.9 million cubic miles (20.3 million cubic km).
    This new estimate is nearly as large as the 5.7 million cubic miles (23.6 million
    cubic km) they calculated for shallow groundwater.

    — significantly thicker than the 6.2-mile depth the 2021 study considered. They
    focused on the upper crust because it is relatively brittle and so possesses fractured
    rock that can, in turn, hold water. Below about 6.2 miles, the crust becomes much
    less porous and likely to contain water, he said.

- en: Shallow aquifers of groundwater, which are mostly fresh water, are used for
    drinking and irrigation. In contrast, deep groundwater is salty and cannot easily
    circulate or flow to the surface, largely cutting it off from the rest of the
    planet's water, Ferguson noted.

    this brine has been trapped for extraordinarily long spans of time. This means
    it could offer valuable insight into Earth's past, the 2021 study noted.

    still active today. Such deep biological communities may shed light on how life

    our planet and how it might develop on other worlds that likely host water deep
    beneath their surfaces.
