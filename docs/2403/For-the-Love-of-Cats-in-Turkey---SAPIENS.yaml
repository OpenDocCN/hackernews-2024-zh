- en: Just as important as these culturally specific factors, however, may well be
    qualities inherent to cats that drive people’s fascination with them. Cats seem
    to have a mind of their own, an inscrutability and imperviousness that make them
    at once fascinating and endearing.

    has to do with how they co-evolved with humans: “Unlike dogs … which have been
    profoundly altered by breeding and the need to fit into human society, cats didn’t
    change that much compared with their wild ancestors and have kept their independent
    spirit.”'

- en: As with any kind of interspecies relationship, human-cat relations have not
    been without tensions. Among medieval Christians, cats were sometimes [treated
    with suspicion](https://theconversation.com/cats-in-the-middle-ages-what-medieval-manuscripts-teach-us-about-our-ancestors-pets-195389)
    because of their associations with paganism and witchcraft. In parts of Europe,
    people killed cats because of their supposed associations with the devil—leading
    to higher rat populations that likely encouraged the spread of the Black Death
    and other plagues in the Middle Ages.

    disease outbreaks. During a [cholera scare in the 1830s](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00263206.2018.1432482),
    a “general crusade” led to cats being “shot without mercy.” Almost 200 years later,
    during the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, some people abandoned their pets—[including
    the otherwise-loved cats](https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/coronavirus-update-turkey-abandon-pets-fear-covid-19)—due
    to fears that the animals could spread disease.

    by the over 100,000 cats in their city—though some see stray cats as out of step
    with their vision of Istanbul’s future as a “modern” city, as Hart’s research
    explores. And as [animal rights advocates](https://www.timeout.com/istanbul/news/the-inspiring-story-of-tails-of-istanbul-111720)
    and cat lovers point out, some community cats live in miserable conditions. In
    [an interview](https://www.trtworld.com/magazine/hit-film-about-istanbuls-cats-finally-comes-home-to-turkiye-12709129),
    Torun, the director of *Kedi*, acknowledged “the darker sides of cats’ lives in
    Istanbul, and the struggles that cat advocates or animal activists have” in caring
    for street animals.
