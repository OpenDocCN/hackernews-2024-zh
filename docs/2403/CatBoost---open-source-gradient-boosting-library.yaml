- en: CatBoost is an algorithm for **gradient boosting on decision trees**. It is
    developed by Yandex researchers and engineers, and is used for search, recommendation
    systems, personal assistant, self-driving cars, weather prediction and many other
    tasks at Yandex and in other companies, including CERN, Cloudflare, Careem taxi.
    It is in open-source and can be used by anyone.
