    floor for app-based food delivery drivers in the city. The law finally [went into
    effect](https://www.geekwire.com/2024/data-from-seattle-food-delivery-drivers-shows-higher-hourly-earnings-but-less-customer-demand/#:~:text=DoorDash%20said%20the%20new%20law,are%20paid%20more%20while%20working.)

    was passed under the banner of protecting gig workers. By setting a compensation
    floor for app-based delivery drivers based on miles driven and amount of time
    worked, the ordinance operates as a (supremely complicated) minimum wage.

    After passing the PayUp package, the City Council then decided that implementing
    the minimum earnings portion of the ordinance would require five new full-time
    government employees in the city's Office of Labor Standards (expanding to nine
    employees by 2027) and $1.2 million per year (escalating to $1.56 million annually
    by 2027). To fund these additional costs—as well as other parts of the PayUp package—the
