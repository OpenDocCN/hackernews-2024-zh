    faster, cheaper, and more available internet and communications.

    TV, digital cameras, Memory foam, cordless tools, Scratch-resistant lenses, water
    filtration systems, and solar panels. When humans develop big things like space
    rockets - other cool things that they never could have imagined are also invented
    along the way.

    and reusable, it makes the cost of sending things to space MUCH cheaper.  Think
    of it like this, imagine how much a plane ticket would cost if you had to throw
    away the airplane after every single landing?!  That’s what we do/did with rockets.
    This is MUCH cheaper by being able to reuse it.

- en: Well, it matters for a big reason. In terms of the history of the Universe,
    humans have only been around for a short short while.  Maybe about 5,000 to 10,000
    years as a civilization that can write and build cool stuff.  That’s a TINY amount
    of time compared to the 4-10Billion years the universe has been around.

    earth and without the sun, we couldn’t survive with our current technology.
  prefs: []

    know that the sun is expanding and getting hotter.  At some point it will be too
    hot for current humans to survive   It may even boil the oceans.  Not fun.

    At some point our planet and sun will be gone. But that’s in a long time away
    from now… it won’t impact me or my children most likely.

    peaceful time EVER!  I’m not kidding.  We are nicer to each other. We work across
    boarders.  We build things together.  There is less war.  We live longer.  We
    cooperate more than ever before. We cooperate when we don’t look like each other. 
    We even cooperate when we don’t speak the same language!  We cooperate when we
    don’t even know each other!!!!!

    We may not always have the ability to invent rockets and cooperate acrosss boarders. 
    We may not always have a space station.  Human history shows that despotism and
    being ruled by jerks where most people are savages to each other and poor - THAT
    is the norm for humans.
