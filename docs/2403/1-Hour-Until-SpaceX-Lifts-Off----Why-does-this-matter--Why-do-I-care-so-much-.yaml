    TV, digital cameras, Memory foam, cordless tools, Scratch-resistant lenses, water
    filtration systems, and solar panels. When humans develop big things like space
    rockets - other cool things that they never could have imagined are also invented
    along the way.

    and reusable, it makes the cost of sending things to space MUCH cheaper.  Think
    of it like this, imagine how much a plane ticket would cost if you had to throw
    away the airplane after every single landing?!  That’s what we do/did with rockets.
    This is MUCH cheaper by being able to reuse it.

    humans have only been around for a short short while.  Maybe about 5,000 to 10,000
    years as a civilization that can write and build cool stuff.  That’s a TINY amount
    of time compared to the 4-10Billion years the universe has been around.

    At some point our planet and sun will be gone. But that’s in a long time away
