    “TikTok ban” last week may own between $29 million and $126 million worth of stock
    in competing tech companies, according to data from Quiver Quantitative, a company
    that tracks congressional investments. Among the 352 members of the House of Representatives
    [who voted “yes” on the bill](https://gizmodo.com/tiktok-ban-bill-passes-in-the-house-1851330061),
    44 reported they own shares of companies including Amazon, Google, Meta, Microsoft,
    and Snap—all corporations that could stand to benefit if TikTok is forced into
    a sale or a full-on ban.

- en: Because Congress scuttled an effort to make their financial disclosures easily
    searchable, the details on these investments are hard to come by. Quiver Quantitative
    can only parse online filings. Some members file their financial disclosures by
    hand, and that information isn’t present in the data set. There are several other
    caveats to consider as well. Members of Congress have to report stock transactions
    within 45 days and disclose their overall stock holdings annually. Because there’s
    a grace period in both cases, the most recent information dates back to earlier
    this year, before the TikTok vote. Officials also don’t have to report the exact
    value of these investments, but instead have to disclose a range ($15,001 to $50,000
    of Microsoft stock, for example). The value of the stocks has also changed since
    reports were filed.

  zh: 因为国会阻止了使其财务披露易于搜索的努力，这些投资的详细信息难以获取。Quiver Quantitative 只能解析在线提交的文件。一些成员手动提交其财务披露，这些信息在数据集中不完整。还有其他几个需要考虑的警告。国会议员必须在45天内报告股票交易，并每年披露其总体股票持有情况。由于在这两种情况下都有宽限期，最新信息可以追溯到今年早些时候，早于TikTok的投票。官员们也不必报告这些投资的确切价值，而是必须披露一个范围（例如微软股票的15,001到50,000美元）。自提交报告以来，股票的价值也发生了变化。

    of Congress are able to make completely unbiased decisions without any consideration
    of their personal stake, I think that even just the possibility of conflict of
