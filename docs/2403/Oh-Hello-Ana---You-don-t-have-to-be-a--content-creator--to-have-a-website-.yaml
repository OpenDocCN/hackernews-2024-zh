- en: This is clearly the result of living in a capitalist society. In recent years,
    people have felt the pressure to monetise their hobbies, so there’s a constant
    state of hustle. We all need money to exist in our society.

- en: In the online communities and circles where I try to hang out, there is a slight
    pressure to “create content”. It is expected to bring you exposure and credibility
    within the community and job opportunities. Of course, this happens. It’s a big
    reason why I’ve even had the opportunities I’ve had so far. I created something,
    and people saw it and wanted to know more about it. It’s excellent, and it feels
    like a reward!

    often say, “I have no content to put on a personal website”, and 1) that is not
    true, and 2) it should not be the goal.

    page](https://anarodrigu.es) with information on how to contact me.

    we go to conferences instead of social media handles! What is the difference between
    a personal website that doesn’t have “content” and a social media account where
    there aren’t many posts anyway? The only thing in common is being reachable.

    day, expand with a link to LinkedIn or, even better, add a CV in HTML. It doesn’t
    matter!
