- en: A Cancer Research UK-funded study, published in [*Cell Genomics*](https://www.cell.com/cell-genomics/fulltext/S2666-979X(24)00038-7), has
    revealed that prostate cancer, which affects one in eight men in their lifetime,
    includes two different subtypes termed evotypes.

- en: The discovery was made by an international team led by the University of Oxford,
    and The University of Manchester, who applied AI (artificial intelligence) on
    data from DNA to identify two different subtypes affecting the prostate.

- en: The team hope their findings could save thousands of lives in future and revolutionise
    how prostate cancer is diagnosed and treated. Ultimately, it could provide tailored
    treatments to each individual patient according to a genetic test which will also
    be delivered using AI.

- en: The ground-breaking research, which involved additional funding from Prostate
    Cancer Research and involved scientists from the University of Oxford, the University
    of Manchester, the University of East Anglia and the Institute of Cancer Research,
    London, highlights how a prostate cancer diagnosis can affect physical, emotional
    and mental wellbeing.

    of the [Nuffield Department of Surgical Sciences](https://www.nds.ox.ac.uk/) at
    the University of Oxford, said: ''Our research demonstrates that prostate tumours
    evolve along multiple pathways, leading to two distinct disease types. This understanding
    is pivotal as it allows us to classify tumours based on how the cancer evolves
    rather than solely on individual gene mutations or expression patterns.'''

    [The Pan Prostate Cancer Group](http://panprostate.org/), set up by scientists
    at [The Institute of Cancer Research (ICR)](https://www.icr.ac.uk/) and The [University
    of East Anglia](https://www.uea.ac.uk/) to analyse genetic data from thousands
    of prostate cancer samples across nine countries.

    aims to develop a genetic test that, when combined with conventional staging and
    grading, can provide a more precise prognosis for each patient, allowing tailored
    treatment decisions.

- en: The researchers used AI to study changes in the DNA of prostate cancer samples
    (using whole genome sequencing) from 159 patients.

- en: They identified two distinct cancer groups among these patients using an AI
    technique called neural networks. These two groups were confirmed by using two
    other mathematical approaches applied to different aspects of the data. This finding
    was validated in other independent datasets from Canada and Australia.

    showing how the two subtypes of prostate cancer develop, ultimately converging
    into two distinct disease types termed ‘evotypes’.

    published today by this global consortium of researchers has the potential to
    make a real difference to people affected by prostate cancer. The more we understand
    about cancer the better chance we have of developing treatments to beat it. We
    are proud to have helped fund this cutting-edge work, which has laid the foundations
    for personalised treatments for people with prostate cancer, allowing more people
    to beat their disease.'''
