The Acoustic Revive Disc Demagnetizer RD-3 is Acoustic Revive's most well-known development. The RD-3 improves the sound of every disc you play at the push of a button. Place your disc on the spindle of the Acoustic Revive RD-3, push the button, and wait until the light goes off. Flip the disk, repeat the process and prepare yourself for a huge surprise! The RD-3 removes residual magnetism from any disc - the RD-3 does not spin, as spinning the disc creates even more of a static charge. What you get is a better tonality, a wider, taller and deeper soundstage and more air between instruments. 

### Why do optical discs, such as CDs, become magnetized?

Firstly, it is thought that ferrous ingredients contained in the printing ink of the label side of the disc is one of the causes of magnetizing discs. For example, iron oxide is used for red, yellow or brown ink, cobalt is used for blue or green ink and nickel is used for silver ink. These materials, iron, cobalt, nickel, are called ferromagnetic substances, and they are relatively easy to magnetize.

Second, problems are caused by the use of aluminum used for the recording side of CD. Currently, the JIS (Japanese Industrial Standard) states that the purity of the aluminum used must be 99.0%. The other 1% contains ferromagnetic substance such as iron, nickel and cobalt. Aluminum is a weak magnetic material, so it is easily influenced by magnetism.

CD players contain magnetic substances, when a disc is played, the rotation of the mechanism, magnet and motor generates a flux which quickly causes discs to become magnetized.

The multi-purpose audio demagnetizer RD-3 is a ground breaking appliance which can easily treat and completely demagnetize all kind of optical discs (CD, DVD, etc). If you demagnetize your disc by RD-3, sound and picture quality are much improved and you will be able to hear aspects of the recording that were inaudible from magnetized discs.

RD-3 also has a remarkable effect on digital recording media such as CD-R, DVD-R. If a disc is demagnetized by RD-3 before recording, the sound quality improves greatly regardless of the recording device or software.

**For this reason, the RD-3 is widely used in the mastering rooms of major recording studios.**

**Diapason in France reviewed and awarded a Gold Medal!**
*"...without doubt, RD-3 works! The sound stage becomes larger. Also the sound becomes smoother and sound separation is excellent. The music flows even better. This is a must item for audiophile and music lovers..." *

**Hifi & Records, Germany**
*"...the sound becomes fresh and sound stage becomes larger. The sound becomes realistic. Very surprised by the effect of RD-3..." *

**The online magazine Ultra Audio, reviewed by Mike Silverton**
*"...the strings, while retaining their characteristic brilliance - if anything, that brilliance became more apparent - had lost their gritty edge. The soundstage was enlarged in a way difficult to describe. Let’s just say that my speakers now seemed more like freestanding sculpture than sources of sound..." *

**The online magazine Affortable Audio, reviewed by Anthony Nicosia**
*"...this double treatment of RD-3 and RIO-5 II was simply amazing. Details I had not noticed now became evidently clear and the soundstage was immense."*
