- en: The Apple-Epic saga has taken a new turn today as the Fortnite game developer,
    Epic Games, [shared](https://www.epicgames.com/site/en-US/news/apple-terminated-epic-s-developer-account)
    that Apple has terminated its developer account. This is a reversal from [the
    earlier approval of Epic’s account last month](https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/16/fortnite-will-return-to-ios-in-europe-thanks-to-dma/),
    which Epic said would allow it to bring back Fortnite to iOS devices in the EU
    by way of the region’s new law, the Digital Markets Act (DMA). But Epic now says
    Apple’s lawyers have sent it a letter saying it’s terminating its Epic Games Sweden
    AB account — a move Epic calls a “serious violation of the DMA” and an indication
    that Apple has no intention of “allowing true competition on iOS devices.”

    potential competitors to the Apple App Store. They are undermining our ability
    to be a viable competitor and they are showing other developers what happens when
    you try to compete with Apple or are critical of their unfair practices,” writes
    Epic on its company blog, where it has also published copies of its correspondence
    with Apple.

    its decision was Epic’s criticism of Apple’s proposed DMA rules, [including this
    post on X](https://x.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1762243725533532587?s=20) (formerly
    Twitter) by Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney. Of course, Epic has been a thorn in Apple’s
    side, having taken it to court over antitrust concerns and lobbying for regulations
    in multiple markets to crack down on Apple’s power and influence over the app
    economy. As a result, Apple would rather be done with Epic, it seems. According
    to Epic, Apple reportedly told the company that it’s “a threat to their ecosystem.”

    and then again assured Apple in writing that it would agree with all the terms
    of its developer agreements after requesting one of the DMA consultations that
    Apple is offering its App Store developers. (The request was initially denied).
    It was after agreeing to abide by its rules that Apple’s lawyers sent a letter
    terminating its Epic Games Sweden AB account.

    letter penned by Apple exec Phil Schiller indicates.

    Schiller reminds the game maker in the letter dated February 23, 2024\. “You also
    testified that Epic deliberately violated Apple’s rules, to make a point and for
    financial gain. More recently, you have described our DMA compliance as ‘hot garbage,’
    a ‘horror show,’ and a ‘devious new instance of Malicious Compliance.’ And you
    have complained about what you called ‘Junk Fees’ and ‘Apple taxes.”

    “strongly suggests that Epic Sweden does not intend to follow the rules.” He adds
    that another intentional breach could “threaten the integrity of the iOS platform,
    as well as the security and privacy of users.”

    determine that Apple has the right to terminate ‘any or all of Epic Games’ wholly
    owned subsidiaries, affiliates, and/or other entities under Epic Games’ control
    at any time and at Apple’s sole discretion.’ In light of Epic’s past and ongoing
    behavior, Apple chose to exercise that right.

    September 2021 judgment which resulted from Epic’s litigation against Apple. This
    judgment stated that “Apple has the contractual right to terminate its DPLA with
    any or all of Epic Games’ wholly owned subsidiaries, affiliates, and/or other
    entities under Epic Games’ control at any time and at Apple’s sole discretion.”
