    a federal law prohibiting it. Thirty-eight states and Washington, DC, have legalized
    wagering, and sports leagues, which once shunned even the faintest idea of betting
    on their games, have embraced it. Even [Disney](https://www.businessinsider.com/disney-ceo-sports-gambling-betting-wont-hurt-family-brand-espn-2021-11),

    $119.84 billion on sports in 2023, according to the American Gaming Association,
    a 27.8% increase from 2022\. Sports-betting revenue hit $10.92 billion last year,
    up 44.5%. While growth [may not continue](https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/news-insights/latest-news-headlines/american-gaming-association-legal-sports-betting-hits-record-revenue-in-2023-80522087)
    at as high of a pace — it''s not clear how many more states will legalize sports
    betting — it''s obvious that betting isn''t slowing down. The industry expects
    activity to keep picking up in the states that have already greenlighted it. The
    American Gaming Association estimates bettors wagered $23.1 billion on this year''s
    Super Bowl alone.'

    bet is that once someone gambles on an NBA or NFL game, they'll develop a taste
    for gambling on other things, too. That will give companies more avenues to dip
    into consumers' wallets, many of which are more lucrative than sports betting.

    iGaming was a "significant chunk" of the company's revenues already and a "hidden
    gem" for DraftKings. In the company's [most recent earnings call](https://draftkings.gcs-web.com/events/event-details/draftkings-q4-2023-earnings-call),
    Robins talked about the overlap between DraftKings customers and Jackpocket customers
    and touted the cross-selling opportunities he saw for all of DraftKings' products.
    "There's all sorts of different levers that you can pull, and the important thing
    is not to force anything, to try to just get the right products in front of the
    right customers," he said.

    its iGaming offering. Caesars and MGM, both of which have sports-betting arms,
    are hopping on the iGaming train, too, though it's a delicate dance for the casino
    stalwarts — they don't want to cannibalize their brick-and-mortar operations too
    much.

    Delaware, Michigan, Rhode Island, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia — while there's
    legislation pending in other places, including New York. As the prevalence of
    online betting grows, there's plenty of revenue to be had. Chad Beynon, an analyst
    at Macquarie, laid out some of the calculations driving these investments. The
    average sports bettor may spend about $1,000 a year, he said, but the average
    person doing iGaming could spend $5,000 — the action is 24/7, while there's a
    finite number of sports games to bet on. And then there's the lottery, where an
    average player will spend $300 a year. All that combined under one umbrella translates
    to dollar signs.

    low-margin business. Companies have to pay leagues or third-party vendors for
    data and wait for games to happen. By contrast, online tables are open all year,
    around the clock, and there's no one to pay to host the action. Plus, Nower told
    me, the payouts on games such as slots or roulette are much more favorable to
    the operator than sports betting.

    but also get into their entertainment budgets, said Chris Grove, a sports-gambling-industry
    investor at Acies Investments and a partner at EKG Ventures, which invested in
    Jackpocket. These companies could start to offer products that may *be* gambling
    but not *feel* like it to consumers, he said, adding that a lot of people didn't
    really think of the lottery as gambling, even though it is.

    some serious downsides for society. Sportsbooks and gambling operations say they're
    a meaningful source of tax revenue for states, which is why states greenlight
    them in the first place. That's true, though just how much money is being raised
    can really vary from state to state. There's also the question of trade-offs.
    Gambling addiction is a real problem that often gets glossed over. According to
    the [National Council on Problem Gambling](https://www.ncpgambling.org/help-treatment/faqs-what-is-problem-gambling/),
    2 million Americans have a severe gambling problem, and another 4 million to 6
    million a mild or moderate problem. As depicted in a [recent "SNL" skit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXZNuwY_5-U),
    the gist of a lot of sports-betting ads is basically, "SPORTS BETTING IS COOL
    AND GREAT AND AWESOME (and also here's a number for if you have a problem, but
    let's not think too hard about that)." What gambling companies will note is that
    they have a number of consumer protections in place that illegal and offshore
    operations don't — cooling-off periods, mechanisms for gamblers to set limits
    on things including their deposits and wagers, and tools to automatically detect
    potential problem gambling.

    York legalizes iGaming, might I start doing slots on my phone? Personally, I don't
