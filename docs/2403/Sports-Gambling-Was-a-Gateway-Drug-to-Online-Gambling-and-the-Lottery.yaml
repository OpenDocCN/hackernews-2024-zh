    person doing iGaming could spend $5,000 — the action is 24/7, while there's a
    finite number of sports games to bet on. And then there's the lottery, where an

- en: Of course, as fun as sports gambling is — as is gambling in general — it has
    some serious downsides for society. Sportsbooks and gambling operations say they're
    a meaningful source of tax revenue for states, which is why states greenlight
    them in the first place. That's true, though just how much money is being raised
    can really vary from state to state. There's also the question of trade-offs.
    Gambling addiction is a real problem that often gets glossed over. According to
    the [National Council on Problem Gambling](https://www.ncpgambling.org/help-treatment/faqs-what-is-problem-gambling/),
    2 million Americans have a severe gambling problem, and another 4 million to 6
    million a mild or moderate problem. As depicted in a [recent "SNL" skit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXZNuwY_5-U),
    the gist of a lot of sports-betting ads is basically, "SPORTS BETTING IS COOL
    AND GREAT AND AWESOME (and also here's a number for if you have a problem, but
    let's not think too hard about that)." What gambling companies will note is that
    they have a number of consumer protections in place that illegal and offshore
    operations don't — cooling-off periods, mechanisms for gamblers to set limits
    on things including their deposits and wagers, and tools to automatically detect
    potential problem gambling.
