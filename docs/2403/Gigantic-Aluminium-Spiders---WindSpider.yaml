- en: WindSpider is now preparing to start building the first full scale unit of its
    crane system in aluminium. It is tailored for installation and major component
    replacement of onshore and offshore wind turbines. The solution eliminates the
    relative motion between the crane and the wind turbine by using the turbine tower
    as support.

    some of the biggest issues in the wind industry and is prepared for the next generations
    of wind turbines, at a substantially lower cost. The solution allows for game
    changing offshore installation and maintenance of floating wind turbines on site
    instead of tow-to-shore for repairs.
