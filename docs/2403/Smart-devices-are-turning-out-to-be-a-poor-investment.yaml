    computing revolution, reading Asimov, watching Star Trek and re-runs of The Jetsons,
    I had certain expectations for the future. Smart homes that did my bidding, palm-sized
    computers that were truly my own, and functional ecosystems that accurately responded
    to my voice or presence all felt right within the realm of possibility.

    the latest example in a long line of grievences. A brand busy wrestling away control
    from the consumer after they've bought the product, the software update gimps
    a feature that has been present on the hardware ever since it launched back in
    2014\.

    it can drastically improve the user experience. Now, just to be clear, I'm aware
    that enthusiasts were using it to replace Amazon's fullscreen video-playing, ad-ridden
    interface with a cleaner alternative home screen. And yes, Amazon wants to protect
    its business interests, which makes complete sense. It uses the ads to subsidize
    the cost of the hardware.

    feature deprecated, but developers were also given no heads-up to update any apps
    that counted on the feature. Apps like cache cleaners and background process cleaning
    apps that can significantly speed up the Fire Stick have been left dead in the
    water with no recourse. This wouldn't have been as big a deal if Amazon had done
    a bang-up job of keeping the Fire Stick speedy, but it didn't.

    The premium streamer was marketed as a utopia for streaming online and offline
    sources with the ability to plug in hard drives, connect to NAS drives, and more.
    At launch, it did precisely that while presenting a beautiful, clean interface
    that was a joy to interact with. However, subsequent updates have converted what
    was otherwise a clean and elegant solution [to an ad-infested overlay that I zoom
    past](https://www.androidpolice.com/google-tv-needs-to-get-better-now/) to jump
    into my streaming app of choice.

    running Chromecast has a home screen that’s more of an advertising space for Google
    than an easy way to get to my content. My television running Google TV makes for
    a situation that is even more egregious. A $1500 television that behaves like
    a 75” billboard. I’m not unaware of the strategy to subsidize hardware through
    ads, but these are not subsidized devices. In the case of the Shield, I paid close
    to $200 for the privilege of a premium experience. And, unlike, say, a Kindle,
    where buyers can pay to remove ads, I was given no choice in the decision to ruin
    my entertainment experience.

    are equal victims of feature deterioration. I've spent hundreds of dollars on
    Nest Hubs and outfitted them in most of my rooms and washrooms. However, Google's
    consistent degradation of the user experience means I use these speakers for little
    more than casting music from the Spotify app. The voice recognition barely works
    on the best of days, and when it does, the answers tend to be wildly inconsistent.
    It wasn't always the case. In fact, at launch, Google's Nest speakers were some
    of the best smart home interfaces you could buy. You'd imagine that the experience
    would only improve from there. That's decidedly not the case. I had high hopes
    that the Fuchsia update would fix the broken command detection, but that's also
    not the case.

    the Nest Secure](https://www.androidpolice.com/nest-secure-dropcam-eol-reminder/)
    home monitoring solution merely three years after launching the product range.
    While I made an initial investment in the Nest ecosystem, I've since switched
    over to a completely local solution that is entirely under my control, stores
    data locally, and won't be going out of action because of bad decision-making
    by another company.

    keep improving, it's become far easier to find devices that play nice with it,
    and where the manufacturers don't step up, the community has stepped in. Similarly,
    much as I enjoy the benefits of an ecosystem, I've been looking at products that
    focus more on the experience than gimmicks or sheer affordability. In the case
    of streaming entertainment, that is, for better or worse, an Apple TV.
