    when the government required Telegram Messenger LLP and other “internet communication”
    providers to store all communication data—and content—for specified durations.
    These providers were also required to supply law enforcement authorities with
    users’ data, the content of their communications, as well as any information necessary
    to decrypt user messages. The FSB (the Russian Federal Security Service) subsequently
    ordered Telegram to assist in decrypting the communications of specific users
    suspected of engaging in terrorism-related activities.

    that would undermine encryption for all of its users. As a result, Russian courts
    fined Telegram and ordered the blocking of its app within the country. The controversy
    extended beyond Telegram, drawing in numerous users who contested the disclosure
    orders in Russian courts. A Russian citizen, Mr Podchasov, escalated the issue
    to the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR), arguing that forced decryption
    of user communication would infringe on the right to private life under Article
    8 of the European Convention of Human Rights (ECHR), which reads as follows:'

    that the requirement of continuous, blanket storage of private user data interferes
    with the right to privacy under the Convention, emphasizing that the possibility
    for national authorities to access these data is a crucial factor for determining
    a human rights violation [at 53]. The Court identified the inherent risks of arbitrary
    government action in secret surveillance in the present case and found again—following
    its stance in [*Roman Zakharov v. Russia*](https://hudoc.echr.coe.int/fre?i=001-159324)—that
    the relevant legislation failed to live up to the quality of law standards and
    lacked the adequate and effective safeguards against misuse [75].  Turning to
    a potential justification for such interference, the ECtHR emphasized the need
    of a careful balancing test that considers the use of modern data storage and
    processing technologies and weighs the potential benefits against important private-life
    interests [62-64].

    access to internet communication data, coupled with decryption requirements, cannot
    be regarded as necessary in a democratic society, and are thus unlawful. It emphasized
    that a direct access of authorities to user data on a generalized basis and without
    sufficient safeguards impairs the very essence of the right to private life under
    the Convention. The Court also highlighted briefs filed by the European Information
    Society Institute (EISI) and Privacy International, which provided insight into
    the workings of end-to-end encryption and explained why mandated backdoors represent
    an illegal and disproportionate measure.

    about human rights standards for private and confidential communication. We are
    currently supporting Telegram in its parallel complaint to the ECtHR, contending
    that blocking its app infringes upon fundamental rights. As part of a collaborative

    submitted a [third-party intervention](https://www.article19.org/resources/russia-blocks-telegram-app/)
    to the ECtHR, arguing that blocking an entire app is a serious and disproportionate
    restriction on freedom of expression. That case is still pending.

    as being a [disaster for online privacy.](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2022/05/eu-commissions-new-proposal-would-undermine-encryption-and-scan-our-messages)

    error-prone AI algorithms to detect criminal behavior. Such detection measures
    will inevitably lead to dangerous and unreliable Client-Side Scanning practices,
