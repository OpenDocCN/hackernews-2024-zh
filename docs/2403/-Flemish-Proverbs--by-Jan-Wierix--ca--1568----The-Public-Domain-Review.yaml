- en: “I wear mourning, seeing the world in which so much deceit abounds.” So laments
    *The Misanthrope* as he skulks along, withdrawn emotionally and sartorially, in
    a deep-hooded cloak. But world-weariness does not amount to wisdom in Jan Wierix’s
    engraving; rather than serving as a hermetic sanctum, the misanthrope’s heavy
    garment only blinds him to the fact that the world — personified as a waddling
    orb — has caught up to him to steal his purse. *The Misanthrope* belongs to a
    series of twelve engraved roundels depicting literal enactments of Flemish proverbs,
    each concerned with some aspect of human folly or treachery. Seven of the scenes,
    collected below, were engraved by Wierix; the precise authorship of the remaining
    five remains mysterious. Rather like many actual proverbs, the *Proverbs’* motifs
    look backward to origins that are uncertain in some respects while maintaining
    vitality through repetition, reuse, and appropriation.
