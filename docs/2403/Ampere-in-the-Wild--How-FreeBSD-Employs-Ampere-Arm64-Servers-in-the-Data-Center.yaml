    and money to keep FreeBSD at the forefront of computing. In late 2020, [Ampere](https://amperecomputing.com/company/about-us)
    donated five servers to the FreeBSD community and the FreeBSD Foundation purchased
    for the community another two in order to support development of FreeBSD.

    and are compatible with the Arm64 instruction set and optimized for users of large
    cloud platforms. Ampere is a cloud native processor supplier for high-performance
    and native cloud computing whose chips are widely known for their density, energy
    efficiency, and performance, making for an ideal configuration for FreeBSD which
    is also known for many of the same attributes. These combined Ampere systems provide

    this means that whenever there is a change to a port - a package blueprint - a
    new package is built. Latest packages are for users who prefer or require the
    latest software without delay.

- en: Quarterly packages are built from a snapshot of the ports tree taken at the
    beginning of each quarter. These packages are for users who prefer to only update
    their packages once every few months. Security patches and updates are backported
    from latest package versions to quarterly packages. This means that the security
    fix is taken from the most recent version of upstream software and then applied
    to an older version, in this case the quarterly updated version.

- en: One of the best-known advantages of FreeBSD is its unequaled reliability and
    performance as an Internet server. The fifth Ampere machine in the Bridgewater
    data center is running, ftp0.freebsd.org, the primary distribution node for all
    image artifacts that FreeBSD produces. A modern ftp server has long since outgrown
    its moniker. To that end, most transfers from ftp.freebsd.org/ftp0.freebsd.org
    are over HTTP or HTTPS protocol. The purpose of these servers remains the same,
    however, files are transferred back and forth between servers and through the
    cloud. By simplifying and speeding distribution in this way, users can quickly
    and easily download and upload the files and images they need.

    porting and testing applications on architectures supported by FreeBSD. The sixth
    Ampere machine, soon to be joined by the seventh, in the Bridgewater data center
    provides reference jails for several versions of FreeBSD. FreeBSD port maintainers
    use these Arm64 servers for testing updates to their ports on Arm64.

    core count scalability. This will be particularly useful to Cloud Service Providers
    and hosting companies who want to provide multiple instance sizes to their customers,
    and to enterprise users who want to optimize hardware utilization by ensuring
    that workloads are given the resources they need and no more. In summary, the
    combination of Ampere native cloud processors on the latest server hardware boosts
    FreeBSD features and uses, while also lending powerful potential and support to
    the FreeBSD community.
