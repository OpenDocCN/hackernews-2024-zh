- en: Later this spring, the spacecraft will be shipped to NASA’s Kennedy Space Center
    in Florida. There, teams of engineers and technicians will carry out final preparations
    with eyes on the clock. Europa Clipper’s launch period opens Oct. 10.

    it will be close enough to use the Red Planet’s gravitational force for added
    momentum. From there, the solar-powered spacecraft will swing back toward Earth
    to get another slingshot boost – from our own planet’s gravitational field – in
    December 2026.

    at Jupiter in 2030\. The spacecraft will orbit the gas giant while it flies by
    Europa 49 times, dipping as close as 16 miles (25 kilometers) from the moon’s
    surface to gather data with its powerful suite of [science instruments](https://europa.nasa.gov/spacecraft/instruments/).
    The information gathered will tell scientists more about the moon’s watery interior.

- en: Europa Clipper’s main science goal is to determine whether there are places
    below the surface of Jupiter’s icy moon, Europa, that could support life. The
    mission’s three main science objectives are to determine the thickness of the
    moon’s icy shell and its surface interactions with the ocean below, to investigate
    its composition, and to characterize its geology. The mission’s detailed exploration
    of Europa will help scientists better understand the astrobiological potential
    for habitable worlds beyond our planet.

    Europa Clipper mission in partnership with the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory
    (APL) in Laurel, Maryland, for NASA’s Science Mission Directorate in Washington.
    APL designed the main spacecraft body in collaboration with JPL and NASA’s Goddard
    Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. The Planetary Missions Program Office
    at NASA’s Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama, executes program
    management of the Europa Clipper mission.
