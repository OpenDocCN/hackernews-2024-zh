- en: This book is written for everyday information workers, future computer whizzes
    looking for discovery, medical researchers with large datasets, graduate students
    with articles to publish, engineers sick of Excel, hobbyists, and retirees looking
    to keep up-to-date. It is not particularly intended for IT professionals, though
    they’d hopefully learn something too.

    sales dwindling, I updated it and released it for free on this website.
