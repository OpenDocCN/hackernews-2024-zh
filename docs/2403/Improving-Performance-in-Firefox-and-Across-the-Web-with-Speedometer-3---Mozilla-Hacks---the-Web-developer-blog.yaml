    thrilled to [announce Speedometer 3](https://browserbench.org/announcements/speedometer3)
    today. Like previous versions of Speedometer, this benchmark measures [what we
    think matters most](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/webvision/full/#performance)
    for performance online: responsiveness. But today’s release is more open and more
    challenging than before, and is the best tool for driving browser performance
    improvements that we’ve ever seen.'

    to bring experts across the industry together in order to rethink how we measure
    browser performance, guided by a shared goal to reflect the real-world Web as
    much as possible. This is the first time the Speedometer benchmark, or any major
    browser benchmark, has been developed through a cross-industry collaboration supported
    by each major browser engine: Blink, Gecko, and WebKit. Working together means
    we can build a shared understanding of what matters to optimize, and facilitates
    broad review of the benchmark itself: both of which make it a stronger lever for
    improving the Web as a whole.'
