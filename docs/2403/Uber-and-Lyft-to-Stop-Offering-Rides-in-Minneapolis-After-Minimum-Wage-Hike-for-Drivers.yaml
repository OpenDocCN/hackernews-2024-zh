- en: Uber and Lyft have vowed to stop offering service in Minneapolis starting May
    1 after the city council voted 10-3 on Thursday to override the mayor’s veto on
    a minimum wage for drivers. Minnesota’s Democratic governor, Tim Walz, vetoed
    a similar pay floor for rideshare drivers statewide last year.

    home to about 3.7 million people, though stressed the state has been working on
    a resolution. Uber will also stop servicing the largest airport in the area, MSP,
    despite the fact that it technically resides outside Minneapolis in an unorganized
    territory that also holds the state’s [first military fort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Snelling_(unorganized_territory),_Minnesota).

    of the Twin Cities, putting 10,000 people out of work and leaving many stranded,”
    Uber told Gizmodo in a statement Friday. “But we know that by working together
    with all stakeholders—drivers, riders and state leaders—we can achieve comprehensive
    statewide legislation that guarantees drivers a fair minimum wage, protects their
    independence and keeps rideshare affordable.”

- en: Much of the fight in Minneapolis comes down to questions about how to calculate
    the minimum wage in order to give rideshare drivers the same $15.57 per hour wage
    mandated for other workers in the city. Since drivers are only paid for the time
    they’re driving passengers, and they’re on the hook to pay for their own expenses
    like gas and insurance, figuring out average driver wages over time can be tricky.

    though local independent news outlet the [Minnesota Reformer](https://minnesotareformer.com/2024/03/14/minneapolis-council-overrides-mayors-veto-of-uber-and-lyft-minimum-rates/)
    points out that’s different from an analysis published by the state in 2022 which
    estimates drivers in Minneapolis would need to earn $0.89 per mile and $0.49 per
    minute to achieve the minimum wage.
