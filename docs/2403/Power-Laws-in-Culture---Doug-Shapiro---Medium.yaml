    as the modern Internet itself. (Or maybe older. The line often misattributed to
    Andy Warhol that “in the future, everyone will be world-famous for 15 minutes”
    was a pre-Internet prediction of fragmentation.) In 1999, Qwest Communications
    produced an ad featuring a motel with “every movie ever made in every language”
    (Figure 1). [*The Long Tail*](https://www.wired.com/2004/10/tail/), published
    in 2004, argued that because the Internet dramatically lowered the cost to store
    and transport information goods, it would result in practically infinite shelf
    space. Faced with far more choice, consumers would shift most of their consumption
    to the “tail,” heralding the end of mass culture and waning importance of hits.
    If anything, Anderson underestimated the size of the tail because he didn’t anticipate
    social media. The tail is not Icelandic synth pop, as it turns out, but an endless
    amount of user generated content.

    was intuitive then and is indisputable now. But it only tells half the story.
    Though it seems contradictory, the Internet *both fragments and concentrates attention*.
    This latter idea was explored by Anita Elberse in her book [*Blockbusters: Hit-making,
    Risk-taking, and the Big Business of Entertainment*](https://www.amazon.com/Blockbusters-Hit-making-Risk-taking-Business-Entertainment-ebook/dp/B00C74OXLO),

    on why suppliers should pursue blockbuster strategies and less about the underlying
    demand-side dynamics that create hits.'

    may seem uncontroversial and certainly feels right intuitively. We know that when
    Beyonce or Taylor Swift releases an album or the next season of *Stranger Things*
    or *Game of Thrones* drops, the collective attention of popular culture, much
    like the eye of Sauron, will be trained on it — at least until the next thing
    comes along. But understanding *why* there are still hits provides insight into
    whether this will persist as the supply of content keeps growing faster than demand.

    loops amplify the popularity of a small number of choices — hits.

    median and mode, is the “bell curve,” aka the **normal** or **Gaussian distribution**.
    The intuition behind a normal distribution is that if you have enough random *independent*
    observations most observations will be relatively close to the average (or mean)
    and equally distributed on either side of it. Many independent natural phenomena
    approximate this distribution, especially when the extremes are bounded, like
    height, weight, test scores or rolling two six-sided dice.

    the quality of your options yourself (“search costs”), as well as the consequences
    (including the reversibility) of making a bad choice (“opportunity costs”). Search
    costs are a function both of the number of choices and the time required to ascertain
    the quality of each choice. For instance, it is easy to quickly judge quality
    when scrolling TikTok and hard when looking for the next multi-season TV series.
    The opportunity cost of listening to the first 8 seconds of a recommended song
    on Spotify is very different than getting a babysitter and going to the movies.

    When they are high and you can see what other people have done, it is reasonable
    to presume that (collectively) other people have more information than you do
    and base your decisions on theirs. When many people do this successively, it results

    to determine the effect of social influence on content choices. They split 14,000

    groups.” All the subjects were invited to visit a website where they were asked
    to rate 48 unknown songs by unknown bands. They were able to download the songs
    if they chose. In the eight social influence groups, subjects could see how many
    times each song had been downloaded by prior visitors from their group; in the

    and, based on the number marked on each, put each ball in its corresponding urn.
    Replace the 10 balls you removed from the barrel with new balls, but this time
    the distribution of new balls will be equivalent to the distribution of balls
    in the urns. (If there are two balls in urn #2 and none in #3, then two of the
    new balls should be marked #2 and none should be marked #3.) Keep running the
    process, removing 10 balls from the barrel at random, placing them in the corresponding
    urns, and adding new balls to the barrel based on the distribution of balls in
