- en: The FT-NIR technique is a non-destructive chemical analysis technology which
    involves shining a beam containing many frequencies of light at a sample and measuring
    the absorption of near-infrared light. HS-GC-IMS involves analysing the gas layer
    above the sample, resulting in a 2D data matrix which can be used to compare samples
    to each other or a reference sample.

    their origin from four different regions of Lebanon with 89 per cent accuracy.
    Lebanese olive oil varies in quality and cost depending on its region of origin.
    In this case, a Fourier Transform infrared (IR) spectroscopy with attenuated total
    reflectance technique was used, which measures the internal reflection of infrared
    light from interaction with a sample and processes the data using mathematical
    algorithms. All these techniques represent a rapid and non-destructive way to
    test products such as olive oil for adulteration or mislabelling.

    research project](/newscenter/news/new-crp-implementation-of-nuclear-techniques-for-authentication-of-foods-with-high-value-labelling-claims-d52042)
    to develop more food authentication tests, for instance to reveal where the olives
    in extra-virgin olive oil were grown.

    analyse the samples in the laboratory and directly in the field, offers high sample
    throughput, low operational costs, requires little or no sample preparation, and
    no need for chemicals or specialized laboratory facilities,” said Christina Vlachou,
    Head of the Food Safety and Control Laboratory of the Joint FAO/IAEA Centre of
    Nuclear Techniques in Food and Agriculture.

    a joint initiative of the IAEA and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the
    United Nations (FAO), this year will see a gathering of food specialists from
    academia, public bodies, industry and commercial organizations at the [International
    Symposium on Food Safety and Control](/events/fsc-symposium-2024). The Symposium,
    which will be held at the IAEA Headquarters in Vienna from 27 to 31 May 2024 in
    collaboration with the FAO, will provide a forum for sharing cutting-edge research
    and innovation, exchanging information and discussing international initiatives
    and needs.

    of Nuclear Techniques in Food and Agriculture](/about/organizational-structure/department-of-nuclear-sciences-and-applications/joint-fao/iaea-centre-of-nuclear-techniques-in-food-and-agriculture),
    a unique international partnership between the two organizations that supports
    the safe and appropriate use of nuclear and related technologies in food and agriculture
    to contribute to global food security and sustainable agricultural development
    worldwide.

    will be among the issues considered at the International Symposium on Food Safety
    and Control. The IAEA will continue, with the expertise of the Joint FAO/IAEA
    Centre, to support food safety and quality and forge partnerships under Atoms4Food.
