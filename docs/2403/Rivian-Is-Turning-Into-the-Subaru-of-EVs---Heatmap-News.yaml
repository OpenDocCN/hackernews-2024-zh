    County, car fans saw a flicker of the past. The truncated EV reminded automotive
    Twitter and Threads of throwback off-road hatchbacks with unusual shapes — the
    Lancia Delta, [AMC Gremlin](https://twitter.com/Agmoseman/status/1766190552188662049),
    [Lada Niva](https://twitter.com/lotsofbumper/status/1767302229915292109), and
    even the maligned Yugo. It reminded me, in spirit more than silhouette, of the
    Subaru Outback from a quarter-century ago.

    that Rivian hopes to duplicate in the age of massive touchscreens.

    kept its marketing efforts aimed at the outdoorsy, dog-loving folks who had become
    loyal to the brand. However, while its fans are the kind of people with a clear,
    vested interest in addressing climate change, the world’s “we love the parks”
    car company has dragged its toes on joining the electric vehicle revolution that
    hopes to slash the car industry’s carbon emissions. Subaru’s electric aversion
    left a giant hole in the market for an adventure EV, one that Rivian seeks to
    fill.

    for coasting on the sustainability reputation of the Prius. The world’s largest
    automaker has been content to tout its “electrified” lineup of mostly hybrids
    and plug-in hybrids, waiting for EV technology and infrastructure to mature before
    it jumps in. Subaru, for all its exercises in Earth mother branding, has done
    the same.

    reflected by the PZEV badge you see on the back of a modern Forester. This means
    the engine burns normal gasoline, but is built with characteristics that reduce
    smog-forming air pollutants. PZEV tech does nothing to reduce a car’s greenhouse
    emissions, but it’s about the best a non-hybrid, plain-old combustion car can
    do.

    has been even more reluctant than its partner, Toyota, to join the battery revolution.
    Subaru’s only entry, the now-canceled plug-in hybrid variant of the Crosstrek,
    posted a paltry 17 miles of electric range before reverting to gas. According
    to [Green Car Reports](https://www.greencarreports.com/news/1138730_subaru-crosstrek-hybrid-phev-is-at-the-end-of-its-extension-cord),
    the hybrid Crosstrek was effectively a “compliance car” — something automakers
    build to satisfy stringent regulations like the state of California’s, not because
    they believe in the vehicle.

    superfans’ desire for *any* fully electric Subaru. But the Solterra is an uninspired
    crossover with a 228-mile range that can’t compare with the current state of the

    ignoring zero-emission technology in the *present* is clear. Even as the EV age
    bubbles up around them, the least-electric car brands are selling lots and lots
    of cars. Americans bought more than 15 million vehicles in 2023, and [632,000](https://www.carpro.com/blog/national-auto-sales-numbers-for-all-automakers-in-2023)
    of them were Subarus, a 14% increase from the year before. Subaru didn’t lose
    money on EVs like Ford has as it tries to establish its battery business. With

    to do. I’ve driven across the empty expanses of the American West in a two-wheel-drive
    Tesla Model 3 that started its life with an EPA-rated 240 miles per charge. It
    was challenging. Subzero temperatures at Bryce Canyon punished the battery. The
    craggy, icy road into Canyonlands National Park pushed the iffy ground clearance
    to its limit. The range was barely enough for us to tempt fate by leaving the
    interstate and crossing the rugged interior of Utah, a decision that saw me end

    such as fold-flat seats, a movie-projecting rooftop tent, and a rear-mounted cargo
    box. The new Rivians should come with at least 300 miles of range, which ought

    continues to fill in.
