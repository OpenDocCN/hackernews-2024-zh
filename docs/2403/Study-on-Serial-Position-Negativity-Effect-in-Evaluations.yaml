    hopeful stepping onto the stage to audition for a coveted role. You’re just as
    qualified and just as talented as those who went before you.

    to an unconscious bias in how we perceive and describe others. It found that the
    later we encounter someone in a sequence, the more negatively we tend to describe
    them.

- en: They hypothesized that when we sequentially encounter people, we focus on distinct
    attributes that differentiate each new person from those we’ve already met. And
    because distinct attributes tend to be negative in the grand scheme of things,
    our descriptions of later-encountered people become increasingly negative.

    992 participants (recruited from Prolific Academic) describe 20 people based on
    their Facebook profile pictures.

- en: The participants described the first few individuals quite positively, using
    an average of 6.2 positive words each. But as they progressed through the sequence,
    their descriptions became significantly more negative, dipping to an average of
    just 4.7 positive words by the 20th person.

    female, with an average age of 42) were shown short video clips of women introducing
    themselves on the popular TV show *The Bachelor*. In these clips, each woman tried
    to make a memorable first impression on the bachelor, often in creative and attention-grabbing
    ways.

    descriptions of the women became increasingly negative: the tenth woman was described
    significantly more negatively, on average, than the first woman, despite the fact
    that the order of the videos was randomized for each participant.'

    encountered more women, they focused more on what made each new woman stand out,
    leading to more unique and ultimately more negative descriptions.

    want to examine how our personal quirks and the groups we belong to might amp
    up or tone down this negative bias towards people we meet later on.

    might be throwing a wrench into things like job interviews and performance reviews
    in the real world.

    happen to be evaluated later in a sequence, whether it’s job applicants, contestants
    on a reality show, or Tinder dates.

    sequentially, whether a networking event or speed dating night, keep in mind that
    your impressions may be tainted by this subtle cognitive bias.
