- en: Exosuits—worn assistive frames that help users move their bodies—represent a
    promising technology that still has big challenges ahead. Not least of which is
    the fatigue problem. Specifically, exosuits that use electrical pulses to move
    a user’s muscles will quickly tire that user out. The fatigue problem has so far
    evaded a neat solution, but an international group of scientists is developing
    a new approach to the exosuit that could tackle fatigue via a system of controllably
    stiffening materials.

    the [Synapsuit](https://wysscenter.ch/advances/synapsuit)—is the brainchild of
    researchers and engineers in South Korea and Switzerland. Their system is designed
    to sidestep the fatigue resulting from prolonged muscle stimulation—a technique
    also known as [functional electrical stimulation](https://mstrust.org.uk/a-z/functional-electrical-stimulation-fes)
    (FES).

    and [rehabilitation](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7364342/), but
    the currents required to forcefully move a user’s body have generally proved too
    tiring on the muscles for prolonged use.

    throughout the day. “It cannot be used for the long term. To compensate for the
    fatigue,” Lee says, “we are using the electrostatic clutch system, so the user
    can maintain a fixed position.”'

- en: The Synapsuit’s electrostatic clutch system, the researchers say, is designed
    to hold a user’s joints in place between FES-driven movements. The clutches themselves
    are lightweight, flexible sleeves placed around the user’s elbows, wrists, and
    knuckles. These sleeves are normally clothlike and flexible but can be rapidly
    stiffened to support the joints they envelop between movements, thus removing
    the need to continuously stimulate the user’s muscles just to hold a joint in
    place.

- en: The clutches stiffen when a voltage is applied to flexible conductive plates
    inside overlapping layers of material within the sleeve. “It’s like a capacitor,”
    says Lee. “When you apply a voltage, these materials pull toward each other and
    create a lot of friction.” The electrical force between the plates locks them
    in place with enough force to support, according to Lee, up to a 2-kilogram load.
    And when the potential is then lowered, the force between the layers goes away
    and the clutch returns to a flexible state.

    fine and careful control—which is what the Synapsuit’s designers intend to be
    able to provide with the rest of their system.

    haven’t shown is how the electrostatic clutch and electrical stimulation can work
    cooperatively. I see it will have benefits for reducing fatigue from FES, but
    how it will be used for cooperative control like stepping or reaching is unclear.
    I don’t think the clutch can do that, it’s only for holding position.”
