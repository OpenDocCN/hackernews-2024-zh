- en: You’ll be asked to disclose whether or not you’re a trader under the European
    Union’s Digital Services Act (DSA) in order to stay compliant across regions when
    distributing on the App Store. If you’re distributing content as a trader, the
    DSA requires that you provide certain identification information, including address
    and contact details, to be displayed on your App Store product pages to consumers
    in the European Union (EU). Confirm your trader status if you have at least one
    app that qualifies you as a trader. You’ll then have the option to turn off or
    specify your trader status for each specific app that you distribute. If you’re
    not a trader, consumers in the EU will be informed that consumer rights stemming
    from applicable consumer protection laws won’t apply to contracts between you
    and them.

    of whether privately or publicly owned, who is acting, including through any person
    acting in his or her name or on his or her behalf, for purposes relating to his
    or her trade, business, craft or profession.” If you have questions about your
    status as a trader, consult with your legal advisor.
