    renowned for meticulous design made seemingly basic software mistakes leading
    to a pair of deadly crashes. Longtime Boeing engineers say the effort was complicated

    ambitious engineers, it was something of a “backwater,” said Peter Lemme, who
    designed the 767’s automated flight controls and is now a consultant. The Max
    was an update of a 50-year-old design, and the changes needed to be limited enough
    that Boeing could produce the new planes like cookie cutters, with few changes
    for either the assembly line or airlines. “As an engineer that’s not the greatest

    During the crashes of Lion Air and Ethiopian Airlines planes that killed 346 people,
