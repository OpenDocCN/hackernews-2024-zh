    Teams endeavoring to craft a “new database kernel” now face a formidable trial
    — how to stand out against the open-source, feature-rich Postgres. What’s their
    unique value proposition?'

- en: Until a revolutionary hardware breakthrough occurs, the advent of practical,
    new, general-purpose database kernels seems unlikely. No singular database can
    match the overall prowess of PG, bolstered by all its extensions — not even Oracle,
    given PG’s ace of being open-source and free ;-)

    PostgreSQL by an order of magnitude in specific aspects (typically performance).
    However, it usually doesn’t take long before the PostgreSQL ecosystem spawns open-source
    extension alternatives. Opting to develop a PG extension rather than a whole new
    database gives teams a crushing speed advantage in playing catch-up!

    advantages and inevitably moving towards a monopoly, mirroring the Linux kernel’s
    status in server OS within a few years. Developer surveys and database trend reports
    confirm this trajectory.

    Many new open-source projects default to PostgreSQL as their primary, if not only,
    database choice. And many new-gen companies are going All in PostgreSQL.

    says, Simplifying tech stacks, reducing components, accelerating development,

    Postgres can replace many backend technologies, including MySQL, Kafka, RabbitMQ,

    Use Postgres** is no longer limited to a few elite teams but becoming a mainstream
    best practice.'

    scenarios, making the idea of a kernel “bottleneck” absurd. Forks of PostgreSQL
    and MySQL that tout kernel modifications as selling points are essentially going
    nowhere.

    plethora of Linux distros, everyone opts for the same kernel. Forking the Linux
    kernel is seen as creating unnecessary difficulties, and the industry frowns upon
    it.

    directions— database **extensions** and **services**! The former pertains to internal
    extensibility, while the latter relates to external composability. Much like the
    OS ecosystem, the competitive landscape will concentrate on **database distributions**.
    In the database domain, only those distributions centered around extensions and
    services stand a chance for ultimate success.

    delisting, while AWS, profiting from offering services and extensions on top of
