["```\nHello,\n\nThank you again for reporting this to us and allowing us time to investigate.\n\nAppleâ€™s version of OpenSSL (LibreSSL) intentionally uses the built-in system trust store as a default source of trust. Because the server certificate can be validated successfully using the built-in system trust store, we don't consider this something that needs to be addressed in our platforms.\n\nBest regards,\nKC\nApple Product Security\n```"]
