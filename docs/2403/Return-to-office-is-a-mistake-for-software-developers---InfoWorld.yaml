- en: The COVID pandemic was a struggle for everyone—some more than others—but a major
    factor in making it through was the ability to work from home. Many companies
    were able to continue only because their workforce could work productively remotely.
    Some companies, notably tech companies, even thrived. One could argue that Zoom
    itself kept us from a complete economic disaster.

    No more commute time meant hours of recaptured leisure and productivity, not to
    mention saved costs and reduced stress. Families were able to spend more time
    together. As work and life mingled together, many people came to enjoy the flexibility
    and freedom that working from home provides. Sure, there were problems, but overall,
    the pandemic changed the workplace for the better.

    to ask (force?) people to “return to office” (RTO). I live in the Philly area,
    and it seems like organizations around here have RTO fever—they want their employees
    to stop working from home and come back to the office full-time. Independence
    Blue Cross, a large health insurer based in Philadelphia, is forcing everyone
    back to the office at least three days a week starting in March. The new mayor
    here, Cherelle Parker, is making all city employees work in the office.

    to RTO. Amazon famously is requiring people hired at remote locations [to move
    closer to an office or lose their jobs](https://www.npr.org/2023/02/17/1158102101/amazon-office-remote-work).
    Ironically, even Zoom has [issued a return-to-office mandate](https://www.cnn.com/2023/08/07/business/zoom-return-to-office/index.html).

    control people who aren’t in their direct line of sight. Many believe that the
    incidental, physical interaction that occurs between people at the office is superior
    to the conversations that take place on video calls and Slack. And I’m sure that
    there are substantial investments in commercial real estate that company executives
    can’t stand to see go unused.

    teams.

- en: Being left alone is nirvana for software developers. Interruptions—the crashing
    of the house of cards the developers carefully build in their brains—are the bane
    of developer productivity. Cubicle farms are breeding grounds for interruptions
    and distractions.  Joel Spolsky, co-founder of Stack Overflow and well-known blogger,
    famously wrote that [every software developer should have their own office with
    a door that closes](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2003/09/24/bionic-office/).
    But few software development companies, perhaps foolishly, are willing to spend
    the money to give every developer a private space.

    uniquely suited to remote work, and indeed software development was early to the
    remote work shift. Code doesn’t care where it gets written and where it is stored.

- en: Remote work is in effect an office with a door that closes, allowing every developer
    to establish their own ground rules for where and how they work. I’m sure that
    home and family life can and do provide distractions, but a developer will have
    much more control over their home environment than the one in an office.

    of working from home, and they will not be pleased at the notion of giving that
    up. Many who are forced back to the office will seek employment where things are
    more flexible.  They will not be willing to give up the flexibility and work-life
    balance that working from home provides.

- en: And of course, the best software companies realize this. People with good development
    skills are hard to find and certainly not concentrated within commuting distance
    of company headquarters. Software developers, especially the best ones, have realized
    that proximity to the home office is decidedly not required for success.  They
    will gradually seek out companies who recognize this and allow them to choose
    where they live and even when they work.

- en: Thus, taking a remote first approach to the workplace environment allows companies
    to seek out and attract those top-tier developers who can command a remote job.
    Companies that force their developers to come into the office will see developers—their
    best developers!—leave for companies that provide a more flexible environment.

    caused by the pandemic will force developers back to the office at their peril.
