- en: The COVID pandemic was a struggle for everyone—some more than others—but a major
    factor in making it through was the ability to work from home. Many companies
    were able to continue only because their workforce could work productively remotely.
    Some companies, notably tech companies, even thrived. One could argue that Zoom
    itself kept us from a complete economic disaster.

  zh: 对每个人来说，COVID疫情都是一场斗争，有些人遭受的影响更大，但关键因素之一是能够在家工作。许多公司之所以能够继续运营，完全归功于其员工可以远程高效工作。一些公司，特别是科技公司，甚至蓬勃发展。可以说，Zoom本身阻止了我们陷入完全的经济灾难。
- en: Working remotely was good in all kinds of ways. Many people really liked it.
    No more commute time meant hours of recaptured leisure and productivity, not to
    mention saved costs and reduced stress. Families were able to spend more time
    together. As work and life mingled together, many people came to enjoy the flexibility
    and freedom that working from home provides. Sure, there were problems, but overall,
    the pandemic changed the workplace for the better.

  zh: 在各种方面远程工作都非常好。很多人真的很喜欢它。不再通勤意味着获得了数小时的休闲和高效的时间，更不用说节省了成本和减少了压力。家庭能够更多地共度时光。随着工作和生活的融合，很多人开始享受在家工作提供的灵活性和自由。当然，也存在问题，但总体来看，疫情改变了工作场所，变得更好。
- en: As the memory of the pandemic begins to fade, however, companies are starting
    to ask (force?) people to “return to office” (RTO). I live in the Philly area,
    and it seems like organizations around here have RTO fever—they want their employees
    to stop working from home and come back to the office full-time. Independence
    Blue Cross, a large health insurer based in Philadelphia, is forcing everyone
    back to the office at least three days a week starting in March. The new mayor
    here, Cherelle Parker, is making all city employees work in the office.

  zh: 然而，随着对疫情的记忆逐渐淡化，公司开始要求（强迫？）员工“返回办公室”（RTO）。我住在费城地区，这里的组织似乎都热衷于RTO，他们希望员工停止在家工作，全职回到办公室。位于费城的大型健康保险公司独立蓝十字会要求员工自3月起每周至少工作三天回到办公室。这里的新市长Cherelle
    Parker要求所有市政府员工在办公室工作。
- en: And it’s not just Philly. Businesses across the country are calling for employees
    to RTO. Amazon famously is requiring people hired at remote locations [to move
    closer to an office or lose their jobs](https://www.npr.org/2023/02/17/1158102101/amazon-office-remote-work).
    Ironically, even Zoom has [issued a return-to-office mandate](https://www.cnn.com/2023/08/07/business/zoom-return-to-office/index.html).

  zh: 不仅仅是费城。全国各地的企业都在要求员工RTO。亚马逊以要求在远程地点雇佣的人员[搬到办公室附近或失去工作](https://www.npr.org/2023/02/17/1158102101/amazon-office-remote-work)而闻名。讽刺的是，即使是Zoom也[发布了返回办公室的命令](https://www.cnn.com/2023/08/07/business/zoom-return-to-office/index.html)。
- en: I get why. Many managers have the (outdated?) notion that they can’t properly
    control people who aren’t in their direct line of sight. Many believe that the
    incidental, physical interaction that occurs between people at the office is superior
    to the conversations that take place on video calls and Slack. And I’m sure that
    there are substantial investments in commercial real estate that company executives
    can’t stand to see go unused.

  zh: 我理解为什么会这样。许多经理认为（过时的？）观念是，他们无法有效控制不在他们直接视线范围内的人员。许多人相信，在办公室人们之间偶然发生的身体互动优于视频通话和Slack上进行的对话。我相信，公司高管对于不能让商业房地产空置感到不安，这其中涉及了大量的投资。

- en: Being left alone is nirvana for software developers. Interruptions—the crashing
    of the house of cards the developers carefully build in their brains—are the bane
    of developer productivity. Cubicle farms are breeding grounds for interruptions
    and distractions.  Joel Spolsky, co-founder of Stack Overflow and well-known blogger,
    famously wrote that [every software developer should have their own office with
    a door that closes](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2003/09/24/bionic-office/).
    But few software development companies, perhaps foolishly, are willing to spend
    the money to give every developer a private space.

  zh: 对软件开发人员来说，独处是一种极乐。打扰——打破他们大脑中精心搭建的“纸牌屋”的行为——是开发人员工作效率的大敌。小隔间农场是打扰和分心的温床。Joel
    Spolsky，Stack Overflow的联合创始人和著名博主，曾经写道[每个软件开发人员都应该有自己带有关闭门的办公室](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2003/09/24/bionic-office/)。但是很少有软件开发公司愿意花钱为每位开发人员提供私人空间，或许这是一种愚蠢的行为。
- en: Working from home solves this problem. Software development organizations are
    uniquely suited to remote work, and indeed software development was early to the
    remote work shift. Code doesn’t care where it gets written and where it is stored.

  zh: 在家工作解决了这个问题。软件开发组织非常适合远程工作，实际上软件开发在远程工作转变方面走在了前面。代码并不在乎在哪里编写和存储。
- en: Remote work is in effect an office with a door that closes, allowing every developer
    to establish their own ground rules for where and how they work. I’m sure that
    home and family life can and do provide distractions, but a developer will have
    much more control over their home environment than the one in an office.

  zh: 远程工作实际上是一种带有关闭门的办公室，允许每个开发人员为他们的工作地点和方式制定自己的基本规则。我确信，家庭生活可能会带来干扰，但开发人员对家庭环境的控制远比办公室中的环境要多。
- en: Thus, the pandemic caused software developers to realize the value and benefits
    of working from home, and they will not be pleased at the notion of giving that
    up. Many who are forced back to the office will seek employment where things are
    more flexible.  They will not be willing to give up the flexibility and work-life
    balance that working from home provides.
  id: totrans-split-15

  zh: 因此，疫情使软件开发人员意识到远程办公的价值和好处，他们不会愿意放弃这一点。许多被迫返回办公室的人会寻找更加灵活的工作机会。他们不愿意放弃在家工作所带来的灵活性和工作与生活的平衡。
- en: And of course, the best software companies realize this. People with good development
    skills are hard to find and certainly not concentrated within commuting distance
    of company headquarters. Software developers, especially the best ones, have realized
    that proximity to the home office is decidedly not required for success.  They
    will gradually seek out companies who recognize this and allow them to choose
    where they live and even when they work.

  zh: 当然，最优秀的软件公司已经意识到了这一点。具备良好开发技能的人才难寻，而且绝对不会集中在公司总部通勤范围内。软件开发人员，尤其是最优秀的人才，已经意识到与公司总部的距离对于成功并非必需。他们会逐渐寻找那些认可这一点并允许他们选择居住地甚至工作时间的公司。
- en: Thus, taking a remote first approach to the workplace environment allows companies
    to seek out and attract those top-tier developers who can command a remote job.
    Companies that force their developers to come into the office will see developers—their
    best developers!—leave for companies that provide a more flexible environment.
