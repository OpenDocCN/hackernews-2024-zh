    to 10% of global revenue repeatedly until they comply with the act. For reference
    Apple had a global revenue of $383 billion USD in 2023 and their net profit was
    $100 billion USD, meaning that the maximum cost of a single fine under the DMA
    is $38.3 billion USD, a sum any gatekeeper would surely blink at. In the case
    of repeated non-compliance they can fine up-to 20% of global revenue in a single

    control over the maximum functionality of all browsers on iOS** and, as a consequence,
    hold up the development and use of web apps. This limits the **competitive constraint
