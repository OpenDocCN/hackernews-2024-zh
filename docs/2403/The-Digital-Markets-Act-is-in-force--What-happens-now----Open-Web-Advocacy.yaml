    that came into law on the 1st of November 2022 that aims to improve fairness,
    contestability and interoperability in very large platforms that operate in the
    EU that have significant and durable market power. In order to not impose expensive
    compliance obligations on small and medium businesses, the act only applies to
    truly massive companies with significant revenue that operate platforms used by
    tens of millions of EU consumers.'

    to 10% of global revenue repeatedly until they comply with the act. For reference
    Apple had a global revenue of $383 billion USD in 2023 and their net profit was
    $100 billion USD, meaning that the maximum cost of a single fine under the DMA
    is $38.3 billion USD, a sum any gatekeeper would surely blink at. In the case
    of repeated non-compliance they can fine up-to 20% of global revenue in a single
    fine.
