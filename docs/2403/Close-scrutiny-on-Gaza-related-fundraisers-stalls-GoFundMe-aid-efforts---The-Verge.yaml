    eSIMs, a digital version of a SIM card connecting devices to mobile networks,
    to Gaza. In the months since October 7th, when Hamas launched an attack on Israel,
    eSIMs have become an essential — though patchwork — method of keeping Gaza online.

    shortly after the GoFundMe campaign was launched, the campaign was placed “under
    review” by the crowdfunding platform. A. and fellow organizers couldn’t withdraw
    the funds that were coming in, which surpassed $3,000 by the end of the seven-day
    fundraising period, nor could they begin refunding donors. The money was in limbo.
    A., who has donated to several GoFundMe campaigns in the past, found themself
    in the middle of a maze of customer service email chains, along with back-and-forths
    with donors and organizers — all while the need in Gaza grew ever more urgent.

    aid efforts, and inconsistent policies have left organizers and donors confused.
    Multiple organizers for fundraisers related to Palestine have received the same
    form email from GoFundMe referring to “the crisis unfolding in the Middle East,”
    requiring them to provide additional information and documentation. These additional

    against Hamas officials and other “facilitators” in the wake of the October 7th
    attacks. In requiring extensive information about who and what money is going
    to, GoFundMe is likely running names against lists of sanctioned individuals and
    groups, says Aaron Martin, assistant professor at the University of Virginia with
    expertise in humanitarian organizations and tech policy. There are government-run
    lists as well as private services used by banks for things like anti-money laundering
    or terrorist financing screenings, Martin says, but these are often incomplete
    or inaccurate, and false positives can occur in regions where people have similar
    names.
