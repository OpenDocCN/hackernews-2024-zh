    or request new ones from customers whose payment methods had expired. But the
    disarray, which was described to TechCrunch by three people familiar with the
    internal payment crisis, took employees and resources away from Fisker’s sales
    team at a time when the company was attempting to save itself by [restructuring
    its business model](https://techcrunch.com/2024/01/04/ev-startup-fisker-sales-goals-dealerships/).

    documentation about its vehicle sales as part of the process of putting together
    the company’s annual financial report, according to two of the people. Fisker
    was often unable to provide satisfactory documentation, leading to more requests
    from PwC.
