- en: If you are a medical professional and have been trained in a “civilised” country
    you probably know next to nothing about the primate *Homo sapiens* and how they
    survive in the wild. You probably do not know that nature has provided an automatic
    manipulator to correct most spinal and peripheral joint lesions in primates. In
    common with millions of other so called civilised people you suffer unnecessarily
    from musculoskeletal problems and are discouraged about how to treat the exponential
    rise in low back pain throughout the developed world. Humans are one of 200 species
    of primates.^([1](#B1)) All primates suffer from musculoskeletal problems; nature,
    recognising this fact, has given primates a way to correct them.

- en: The study of animals in the wild has been a lifelong pursuit. I grew up with
    tribal people and in 1953-4 commanded a platoon of African soldiers from nine
    tribes, who taught me to sleep on my side without a pillow so that I could listen
    out for danger with both ears. I have organised over 14 expeditions all over the
    world to meet native peoples and study their sleeping and resting postures. They
    all adopted similar postures and exhibited few musculoskeletal problems. I must
    emphasise that this is not a comparison of genes or races but of lifestyles. I
    tried to carry out surveys to collect evidence but they were meaningless, as tribespeople
    give you the answer they think you want. They often object to having their photographs
    taken, so I have demonstrated the postures.

    position in which I have also seen chimpanzees and gibbons sleeping—and a Kenya
    African in a similar position on a palm leaf mattress on a concrete floor. Note
    how he uses his laterally rotated arm as a pillow and can listen out for danger
    with both ears.

- en: 'When lying on one side you do not even need the arm as a pillow: when the lower
    shoulder is fully hunched, the neck is completely supported. I think the neck
    should deviate towards the ground as gravity then shuts the mouth, preventing
    insects from entering, and a little traction is applied to the cervical spine
    (fig , top). When the head is down, the vertebrae are stretched between two anchors
    and every time the ribs move through breathing the tension is increased, the vertebrae
    realign themselves, and the movement keeps the joints lubricated. Current thinking
    is to keep the spine straight by use of a pillow. Has anyone ever seen a gorilla
    shinning up a tree with a pillow? Note also the plantar flexed foot. A dorsiflexed
    foot rotates the knee and alters the Q angle (between the resultant pull of the
    quadriceps muscle and the patella tendon), producing uneven wear and, in time,
    pain.'

    wearing no clothes as the penis dangles in the dust and can get bitten by insects.
    When the legs are in the reverse recovery position (fig , bottom), the penis lies
    on the lower thigh and is protected. In this position the Achilles tendon of the
    leading foot can be inserted in the gap between the big toe and the first lesser
    toe to help correct a bunion.

- en: When sleeping in the open in very cold climates and when the ground is wet,
    humans often resort to sleeping on their shins, like the Tibetan caravaneers photographed
    by Peter, Prince of Greece and Denmark, in 1938 (fig ). Nature has not covered
    the anterior border of the tibia and the medial border of the ulna with muscle,
    so in this position there is only skin and bone in contact with the cold ground
    and heat loss is reduced. The body is also folded to conserve heat; both ears
    can listen for danger, be it lion or terrorist; and when the head is down gravity
    shuts the mouth and it is impossible to snore.

    to reset shoulder, elbow, and wrist: accessory joint movement is regained because
    the weight of the head resting on the arm is at right angles to the line of movement,
    producing a lateral glide. I have seen Howler monkeys using this position in Costa
    Rica.'

- en: 'Quadrupedal lying (fig ) is ideal for stretching collagen fibre throughout
    the body. In the penis protect position, with the pelvis locked, the spine is
    rotated and flexed. With the elbows out sideways and the chest on the ground,
    many spinal lesions can be corrected gently using nature''s automatic manipulator.
    Animals are clever because they use the radiant heat from the sun to encourage
    relaxation of their muscles when they adopt this posture. In this photograph note
    that the dog''s sternum is in full contact with the ground but that of the human
    is not: this can be easily corrected by rotating the right arm medially to lower
    the sternum. It has been noted that guide dogs working in towns breathe the same
    pollutants as humans yet do not have asthma. Could this be because when they lie
    on their chests the kickback from the upper ribs keeps the corresponding vertebrae
    mobile, allowing the sympathetic system to work efficiently?'

- en: Arabs in the Sahara will sit in the position shown in figure for hours and it
    keeps the forefoot aligned on the hindfoot, as the ischia rest directly on the
    calcanea and the feet point straight backwards. People who sit like this do not
    seem to get much osteoarthritis in their knees in old age. Cross legged sitting
    prevents arthritic hips. A flying doctor from Kenya remarked to me that over the
    years as local tribesmen became more civilised he more often saw arthritis of
    hips and knees.

- en: Largely anecdotal evidence has been collected by “old timers” for over 50 years
    from non-Western societies that low back pain and joint stiffness is markedly
    reduced by adopting natural sleeping and resting postures. This observation must
    be recorded to allow further research in this direction as these primitive societies
    no longer exist and the great apes living in the wild are heading for extinction.
    All we have to do is to be good primates and use these preventive techniques.
