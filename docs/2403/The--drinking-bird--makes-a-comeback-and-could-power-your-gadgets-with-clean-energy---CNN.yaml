- en: The top-hatted “drinking bird,” once a fixture in science classrooms for demonstrating
    the basics of thermodynamics, is making a surprising comeback — as the inspiration
    for a new [clean-energy](https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/12/world/wind-solar-renewables-record-climate-intl/index.html)
    generator that could one day power your watch and phone.

- en: Scientists in Hong Kong and China have used the famous toy, also known as the
    “Dippy Bird,” to develop an engine capable of using the power of water evaporation
    to generate electricity, according to a [study](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.device.2024.100318)
    published Thursday in the journal Device.

    back-and-forth movement into [electrical power](https://www.cnn.com/2023/10/30/politics/electric-transmission-lines-biden-climate/index.html).

    bulbs, representing the head and body of the bird, which are connected by a long
    glass tube. Methylene chloride, a highly volatile liquid, is contained within
    the structure.'

- en: After the bird’s beak is dipped into a cup of water, it springs back into its
    natural upstanding position, and the water begins to evaporate and cool the head.
    This causes the volatile liquid from the lower bulb to rise up the tube, due to
    a difference in pressure, and as a result, the bird’s center of gravity begins
    to shift, tipping its beak back into the water.

- en: In the natural world, evaporation occurs when sunlight warms the surface of
    the Earth, breaking the bonds which hold water molecules together. This causes
    liquid water from oceans, lakes and other surface waters to be [converted into
    vapor](https://www.cnn.com/2023/08/01/us/colorado-river-water-loss-lake-mead-climate/index.html).
    It’s the driving force of the Earth’s natural water cycle.

    in the Earth’s surface and results in the “most significant amount of energy transfer

    water, a “readily available fuel source.”

    mechanical energy first, and then translate it into electricity,” Wu said. “It

    convert mechanical energy into electricity — to both sides of the bird’s “engine,”

    ambient conditions, including liquid crystal displays (LCDs), temperature sensors
    and calculators. The idea is that one day the generator could be used in more
    commonly used everyday devices.

- en: Until now, previous attempts to convert evaporation energy into electricity
    have suffered from a low-conversion efficiency. But using the drinking bird method, scientists
    have managed to generate an output of 100 volts using just 100 millilitrers of
    water, enough to power small electronic devices.
