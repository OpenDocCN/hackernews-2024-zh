- en: Founded in 2022, Keeling Labs was started as a place to develop and apply machine
    learning to solve the world's biggest problem—climate change. Our current priority
    is getting the grid to run on 100% clean energy, which is currently limited by
    battery storage (specifically, the algorithms that control them).

    capacity, enabling the grid to run on more clean energy from wind and solar. You

    engineers that want to make a serious difference in the climate change problem
    with their work. The code you write at Keeling Labs will directly impact emissions,
    control physical infrastructure, and help scale climate solution.
