- en: An intriguing video has surfaced recently, showing the wind-tunnel testing of
    a French future fighter concept, a tailless jet fitted with prominent leading-edge
    vortex controllers, or LEVCONs. Interestingly, this is a central feature of the
    [Russian Su-57 Felon advanced fighter](https://www.twz.com/20434/no-the-su-57-isnt-junk-six-features-we-like-on-russias-new-fighter).
    In fact, they look extremely similar in general configuration. This specialized
    control surface arrangement could see more use in the future, possibly on new-generation
    fighter designs with tailless layouts.

    recherches aérospatiales — France’s national aerospace research center. The footage
    in question shows a wind tunnel model prepared for the Superman project, a study
    conducted by Onera’s Lille branch. The test, in Onera’s S1 wind tunnel, was designed
    to “study the behavior of a combat aircraft at the limits of its flight envelope.”
    It included “a new LEVCON control surface for the stealth aircraft of the future
    is designed to achieve 100 degrees of pitch in one second.” The tests [appear](https://aviationweek.com/shownews/paris-air-show/french-aerospace-lab-onera-presents-fcas-hypersonic-research)

    NGF.” Exactly how much of the Superman combat aircraft research program will eventually
    make it into NGF won’t be known for some time. With some — but by no means all
    — previous concepts showing a tailless fighter, it’s clear that this is one of
    the options under consideration. If chosen, then it could make sense for this
    configuration to be combined with LEVCONs.

    in terms of broadband low observability against a wide variety of radar types
    and reduce radar signature from multiple perspectives. Other benefits include
    reduced aerodynamic drag, providing better performance for sustained high-speed
    dashes and cruising flight.

    unless combined with advanced fly-by-wire digital flight control technology, and
    perhaps also thrust-vectoring engine systems. LEVCONs would be another way of
    conferring an improved level of stability and especially agility for a tailless
    design like that seen in the S1 wind tunnel, without sacrificing heavily the positive
    attributes of a tailless design.

    aircraft at various parts of the flight envelope.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For low-speed flight, LEVCONS can generate additional lift, boosting control
    authority, for example on approach to an aircraft carrier. It’s for this reason
    primarily, that a less pronounced version of them is found on Russia’s carrier-based
    [MiG-29K/KUB](https://www.twz.com/6121/heres-why-the-russian-mig-29kr-crashed-into-the-sea-according-to-report)
    fighter and the naval variant of the Indian [HAL Light Combat Aircraft](https://www.twz.com/first-fighters-land-aboard-indias-first-homegrown-aircraft-carrier).
    Once deployed, they improve the aircraft’s stability during the approach to the
    ship, but they are a much simpler proposition than the kinds of all-around flight-control
    surfaces found on the Su-57 and the Superman study. These can work like something
    of a hybrid maneuvering slat and canard and even operate independently to instigate
    roll as part of the aircraft’s integrated digital flight control system.

    as possible — even without any kind of vertical tail surfaces and a blended delta-like
    wing architecture. While the [Su-57](https://www.twz.com/35667/check-out-these-images-of-russias-second-su-57-felon-fighter-under-construction)
    does have vertical and horizontal tail surfaces, maneuverability is the reason
    that these devices are also found on the Felon — which features no fewer than
    12 moving flight control surfaces (plus thrust-vectoring engine nozzles).

- en: In this kind of application, the LEVCONs serve to increase static instability,
    boosting maneuverability, especially at supersonic speeds. Specifically, they
    move the aircraft’s center of pressure forward, making it more unstable and therefore
    more maneuverable. Managing high static instability also requires an advanced
    fly-by-wire flight-control system.

    that the most important function of the LEVCONs is “to recover the aircraft in
    the event of a thrust-vector control failure at post-stall angles of attack. They
    do this by deflecting sharply downward, reducing the plan-projected area of the
    wing-body section in front of the center of gravity.”

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So, while LEVCONs can offer several advantages to highly maneuverable aircraft
    designs, it’s notable that they are particularly relevant for tailless fighters,
    which are being looked at closely in Europe, the United States, and China, for
    example.

    aspect of the airframe is not ideal, but this can be overcome, at least to a degree,
    by locking the surfaces in a streamlined configuration that maximizes low observability
    when not needing to make hard maneuver in certain areas of the aircraft’s operating
    envelope. They can be designed to meld nearly seamlessly into the aircraft’s overall
    low-observable design in this position in an attempt to minimize any penalty paid
    in terms of radar signature.
