- en: 'Astro DB brings together the web framework, the schema, the seed file, and
    the database itself all into a single cohesive story. We even include an ORM for
    you: Drizzle. We selected Drizzle because it is a type-safe ORM that lets you
    get as close to the metal as you want, and is also pluggable which allowed us
    to add our own behavior on top.'
