- en: Build systems are awesome, terrifying – and unloved. They are used by every
    developer around the world, but are rarely the object of study. In this paper
    we offer a systematic, and executable, framework for developing and comparing
    build systems, viewing them as related points in a landscape rather than as isolated
    phenomena. By teasing apart existing build systems, we can recombine their components,
    allowing us to prototype new build systems with desired properties.

    systems a la carte”](../build-systems-a-la-carte/), with more detail and a new
    section on our experience of turning theory into practice.
