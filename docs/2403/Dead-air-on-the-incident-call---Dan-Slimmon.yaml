    the next: absolute silence.'

    – whose job is to keep the problem-solving effort moving forward – you must develop
    a keen ear for silence.

    In this post, I’ll present a few incident scenarios and explore the role of the
    incident commander in breaking (or simply abiding in) dead air.

- en: Sylvain (from the [s]upport team) has spun up an incident call after getting
    3 consecutive reports of broken CSS on the production app. You are the incident
    commander, and Oscar (from [o]perations) has immediately volunteered to be the
    primary investigator. Deanna and Deepak (software [d]evs) are also on the call.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There’s some ambiguity about whether the CSS issue merits a status page post.
    Nobody has found a “smoking gun” showing that, for example, 404 errors are happening
    at an elevated rate. And now Oscar announces, “I’m seeing some log entries from
    the web server that look a little weird. I’m gonna look at those.” This is the
    beginning of a 5-minute silence.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: During the silence, Deanna, Deepak, and Sylvain are all waiting, hoping that
    these log entries that Oscar just noticed turn out to be the smoking gun. They’re
    putting their eggs in the basket of Oscar’s intuition. Hopefully he’s seen this
    issue before, and any minute now he’ll say “Okay, I’m pushing a fix.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The problem is, it’s equally possible that Oscar has latched onto a red herring
    (some salient but ultimately irrelevant observation). If there were a conversation
    in place of silence, then Deanna could be researching the error message, or Deepak
    might be able to immediately rule out the error as a cause of the broken CSS,
    or Sylvain could provide a detail from one of the customer tickets that would
    narrow the scope of the investigation. But instead, everybody’s twiddling their
    thumbs hoping for Oscar to emerge with a fix.

    of a widespread system failure. He’s said as much. Now there’s relative silence
    on the call for five minutes.

- en: 'Deanna and Deepak are basically in agreement with Oscar: there’s no evidence
    of a system health issue. To them, and to Oscar, it’s not really clear how strong
    a signal Sylvain has. It could just be a coincidence that these three reports
    all arrived in a row. The engineers on the call are thinking, *I guess we’ll keep
    poking at this, but we’re not even sure this is a real issue. We need more information.*'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Sylvain, on the other hand, is positive that something is wrong. Getting 3 support
    tickets in a row about the same behavior is very strong evidence to him. He’s
    presented his information to the investigators, and now he’s thinking, *Okay,
    they say it’s not a widespread issue. But I’m sure Oscar is getting to the bottom
    of it*.

    broken CSS on the production website. You are the incident commander. The investigation
    has been going along, and Oscar is chasing down a hunch that a particular error
    message from the web server is related to the stylesheet failures. Deanna is digging
    into some code to help validate Oscar’s hunch.

    and Deanna to come up with their findings. So Deepak reads the chat scrollback,
    which takes him about 5 minutes. It’s not until the end of those 5 minutes that
    Deepak understands what Oscar and Deanna are working on.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As it happens, Deepak has seen the web server error message in question before.
    He knows what it means, and he can explain why it’s a red herring. But for the
    5 minutes it takes him to get up to speed by reading the chat scrollback, silence
    persists.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In order to keep a problem-solving effort moving forward, an incident commander
    should ensure that every new participant gets up-to-date knowledge of what the
    group is doing and why. At small scale (less than, say, 10 people on the call),
    you can do this verbally. For example, you could say to Deepak when he joins the
    call, “Hi Deepak. Right now, Oscar and Deanna are investigating a web server error
    message that might be related to failed stylesheet loads. You can see the error
    message in the chat.”

    necessary to have a shared document of some sort, continuously updated by a “scribe.”
    It’s not sufficient for this document to be merely a timeline of events: it must
    highlight the *current state* of the joint diagnostic effort. I recommend [clinical
    troubleshooting](https://blog.danslimmon.com/2024/03/08/clinical-troubleshooting-diagnose-any-production-issue-fast/)

    or collect some data, or research some question. As long as such a silence is
    negotiated in advance, with a specific time to reconvene, it can serve a crucial
    purpose. I call this **functional dead air**.

    is functional. First, communicate what’s being done by whom, and why. Only then,
    do it.
