- en: March is the month which proverbially ‘comes in like a lion and goes out like
    a lamb’. That proverb, which dates back to the 17th century, is just one of many
    traditional sayings about the tempestuous nature of this month’s weather. This
    stormy month, part winter and part spring, has been called ‘March many-weathers’
    – and, just as it contains many weathers, it has also had a surprising multiplicity
    of names in English.

- en: In linguistic terms, March has an interesting and unusual history. It is the
    only month in the calendar to have had an alternative name in different dialects
    of English until relatively modern times. It owes its most well-known name to
    the Roman god Mars, because festivals in his honour used to be celebrated during
    the month. Like the other month-names now standard in British English, this name
    was established in England during the Anglo-Saxon period, as part of the adoption
    of the Julian calendar.
