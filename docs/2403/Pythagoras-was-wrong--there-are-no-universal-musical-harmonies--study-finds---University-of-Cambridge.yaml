- en: According to the Ancient Greek philosopher Pythagoras, ‘consonance’ – a pleasant-sounding
    combination of notes – is produced by special relationships between simple numbers
    such as 3 and 4\. More recently, scholars have tried to find psychological explanations,
    but these ‘integer ratios’ are still credited with making a chord sound beautiful,
    and deviation from them is thought to make music ‘dissonant’, unpleasant sounding.

    shows that in normal listening contexts, we do not actually prefer chords to be
    perfectly in these mathematical ratios.

    this gives life to the sounds, and that is attractive to us,” said co-author,
    Dr Peter Harrison, from Cambridge’s Faculty of Music and Director of its Centre
    for Music and Science.

- en: The researchers also found that the role played by these mathematical relationships
    disappears when you consider certain musical instruments that are less familiar
    to Western musicians, audiences and scholars. These instruments tend to be bells,
    gongs, types of xylophones and other kinds of pitched percussion instruments.
    In particular, they studied the ‘bonang’, an instrument from the Javanese gamelan
    built from a collection of small gongs.

    the US and South Korea participated in 23 behavioural experiments. Participants
    were played chords and invited to give each a numeric pleasantness rating or to
    use a slider to adjust particular notes in a chord to make it sound more pleasant.
    The experiments produced over 235,000 human judgments.

    in on particular musical intervals and asked participants to judge whether they
    preferred them perfectly tuned, slightly sharp or slightly flat. The researchers
    were surprised to find a significant preference for slight imperfection, or ‘inharmonicity’.
    Other experiments explored harmony perception with Western and non-Western musical
    instruments, including the bonang.

    musical scale used in the Indonesian culture from which it comes. These consonances
    cannot be replicated on a Western piano, for instance, because they would fall
    between the cracks of the scale traditionally used.

    that chords have to reflect these mathematical relationships. We show that there
    are many more kinds of harmony out there, and that there are good reasons why

    a whole new harmonic language that people intuitively appreciate, they don’t need
    to study it to appreciate it. A lot of experimental music in the last 100 years
    of Western classical music has been quite hard for listeners because it involves
    highly abstract structures that are hard to enjoy. In contrast, psychological
    findings like ours can help stimulate new music that listeners intuitively enjoy.”
