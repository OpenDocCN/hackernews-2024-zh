- en: By now, it seems clear that much of the hype around generative AI is overblown
    — if not a bubble that's bound to burst — and some businesses that invested in
    the tech are learning that the hard way.

- en: The tech's drawbacks are hard to overlook. Large language models like ChatGPT
    are [prone to hallucinating](https://futurism.com/chatgpt-lost-mind) and spreading
    misinformation. Both chatbots and AI image makers have been [accused of plagiarizing
    writers](https://futurism.com/the-byte/john-grisham-furious-ai) and [artists](https://futurism.com/artists-sue-stabile-diffusion-midjourney).
    And overall, the hardware that generative AI uses [needs enormous amounts of energy](https://futurism.com/the-byte/ai-electricity-use-spiking-power-entire-country),
    gutting the environment.

    AI researcher, businesses are finding out that the tech just can't be depended
    on.

    after it began swearing at customers and trash talking its employers. A Californian
    car dealership had to do the same after its ChatGPT-powered car salesman started
    [offering buyers $1 cars](https://futurism.com/the-byte/car-dealership-ai).

    a grieving customer](https://futurism.com/the-byte/airline-chatbot-bereavement-funeral), telling
    them that if they bought a ticket at full price to attend their grandmother's
    funeral, they were guaranteed a bereavement discount later.

    CEO of AI consulting firm Humane Intelligence, told *Axios*. "The core problem
    is that GenAI models are not information retrieval systems," she added. "They
    are synthesizing systems, with no ability to discern from the data it''s trained
    on unless significant guardrails are put in place."'

    [that AI is a bubble](https://futurism.com/cory-doctorow-blasts-ai-fraud-bubble)
    like with crypto or [Dot Com startups](https://futurism.com/ai-dot-com-bubble).
    Projections that AI will become an [over one trillion dollar industry](https://www.bloomberg.com/company/press/generative-ai-to-become-a-1-3-trillion-market-by-2032-research-finds/)
    within the next decade certainly sound reminiscent of the hubris that always comes
    with these booms before the busts.

    advance quickly enough to keep up with the hype, and will perhaps [undergo a lengthy
    period of stagnation](https://futurism.com/the-byte/robotics-expert-ai-hype-reality-check).
    Investors that have poured billion of dollars into the industry in a very short
    period of time, expecting a lucrative turnaround, may not have the patience to
    hold out.

    a lot of problems."'
