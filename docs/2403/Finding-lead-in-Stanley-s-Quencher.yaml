- en: In a remarkable story of product innovation, Stanley became, in the [words](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RADEfBJmtk4)
    of its Global President Terence Reilly, a “110-year-old overnight success.” The
    company’s journey from inventing the first vacuum-sealed water bottle in 1913
    to becoming a TikTok sensation began with the launch of the Quencher tumbler in
    2016\. The Quencher initially saw modest success, but a strategic shift in 2020
    towards vibrant new colors and finishes caught the eye of a new generation of
    consumers. This pivot, coupled with savvy social media marketing and influencer
    collaborations, caused Stanley's revenue to skyrocket from $70 million in 2019
    to $750 million in 2023.

    heights has revealed itself as a double-edged sword. Social media influencers
    [have discovered](https://www.wired.com/story/stanley-cup-lead-soldering/) that
    lead solder is used in the Quencher’s manufacturing process, jeopardizing Stanley’s
    success.

    industrial X-ray CT scanner is the perfect tool to see inside Stanley’s tumbler
    to understand how it’s made and whether or not lead solder truly poses a risk
    to consumers.

    by a vacuum that minimizes heat transfer. The manufacturing process for vacuum-insulated
    stainless steel containers starts by forming two separate stainless steel layers
    for the inner and outer walls, which are then welded together at the rim to create
    a sealed unit. The cup is placed in a vacuum chamber, and air is removed through
    a hole that’s left in the bottom of the outer layer.

    the cup is removed from the vacuum chamber. Lead solder provides a reliable and
    cost-effective answer. During the assembly of the inner and outer layers, a small
    lead pellet is placed above the air-escape hole. After the air is pulled out of
    the cup, the vacuum chamber is heated just enough to melt the lead, causing it
    to flow into the air escape hole and seal it. When the vacuum chamber is opened,
    a vacuum remains between the cup’s walls.

    layers, as well as the solder point. We also see a metal disk attached to a welded
    tab, which may be a component used to position the solder and hold it in place
    before it’s melted. Dense materials or those made of elements with higher atomic
    numbers attenuate (absorb or scatter) X-rays more. Lead is very dense and tends
    to block X-rays, which is why it’s used to protect people from X-ray radiation.
    In [Voyager](https://www.lumafield.com/products/voyager-ai-powered-cloud-analysis-software),
    we’ve applied a color map to the reconstruction that corresponds to the range
    of material attenuation coefficients. Lead, the most attenuating, appears here
    as a solid red. The scan shows that the lead solder is completely shielded by
    a stainless steel cover just below it.

    saying, “Once sealed, this area is covered with a durable stainless steel layer,
    making it inaccessible to consumers. Rest assured that no lead is present on the
    surface of any Stanley product that comes into contact with the consumer nor the
    contents of the product. In the rare occurrence the base cap of a product comes
    off due to ordinary use and exposes this seal, it is eligible for our Lifetime
    Warranty.”

    industries, including electronics, due to its superior workability and lower melting
    point compared to unleaded alternatives. The Stanley revelation has sparked a
    debate on the difficult trade-offs manufacturers face between continuing with
    a well-established but potentially harmful material or investing in the development
    of safer—albeit more expensive and technically challenging—alternatives.

- en: In response to the controversy, other reusable water bottle companies have been
    highlighting their lead-free manufacturing processes. Brands like Owala, Hydro
    Flask, and Klean Kanteen have successfully eliminated lead from their products,
    opting for alternative materials such as noncrystalline silica beads or proprietary
    sealants. These companies demonstrate that while the transition to lead-free manufacturing
    is complex and costly, it is feasible and aligns with growing consumer demand
    for environmentally friendly and safe products.

    on companies to not compromise on safety or sustainability will only increase.
    Perhaps just as important as continued innovation is educating consumers on the
    relative risks associated with materials and manufacturing processes. Proactively
    demystifying the product's lifecycle and design choices could mean the difference
    between soaring success and a viral backlash.
