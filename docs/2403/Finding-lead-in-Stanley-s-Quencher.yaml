- en: In a remarkable story of product innovation, Stanley became, in the [words](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RADEfBJmtk4)
    of its Global President Terence Reilly, a “110-year-old overnight success.” The
    company’s journey from inventing the first vacuum-sealed water bottle in 1913
    to becoming a TikTok sensation began with the launch of the Quencher tumbler in
    2016\. The Quencher initially saw modest success, but a strategic shift in 2020
    towards vibrant new colors and finishes caught the eye of a new generation of
    consumers. This pivot, coupled with savvy social media marketing and influencer
    collaborations, caused Stanley's revenue to skyrocket from $70 million in 2019
    to $750 million in 2023.

  zh: 在一个关于产品创新的引人注目的故事中，正如其全球总裁Terence Reilly所说，Stanley成为了“110年的一夜成功”。公司从1913年发明第一个真空密封水瓶开始，到2016年Quencher杯的推出引发了TikTok的轰动。Quencher最初取得了适度的成功，但2020年战略转向向新一代消费者推出充满活力的新颜色和饰面。这种转变，加上精明的社交媒体营销和影响者合作，使Stanley的收入从2019年的7000万美元飙升到2023年的7.5亿美元。
- en: More recently, the same social media enthusiasm that propelled Stanley to new
    heights has revealed itself as a double-edged sword. Social media influencers
    [have discovered](https://www.wired.com/story/stanley-cup-lead-soldering/) that
    lead solder is used in the Quencher’s manufacturing process, jeopardizing Stanley’s
    success.

- en: Stanley’s cups have inner and outer walls made of stainless steel, separated
    by a vacuum that minimizes heat transfer. The manufacturing process for vacuum-insulated
    stainless steel containers starts by forming two separate stainless steel layers
    for the inner and outer walls, which are then welded together at the rim to create
    a sealed unit. The cup is placed in a vacuum chamber, and air is removed through
    a hole that’s left in the bottom of the outer layer.

  zh: Stanley的水杯内外壁由不锈钢制成，由真空隔开以最小化热传递。真空绝缘不锈钢容器的制造过程始于形成内外两层不锈钢壁，然后在边缘处焊接在一起以创建密封单元。将杯子放入真空室，通过底部外层留下的孔将空气抽出。
- en: At this point, the hole through which air was evacuated must be sealed before
    the cup is removed from the vacuum chamber. Lead solder provides a reliable and
    cost-effective answer. During the assembly of the inner and outer layers, a small
    lead pellet is placed above the air-escape hole. After the air is pulled out of
    the cup, the vacuum chamber is heated just enough to melt the lead, causing it
    to flow into the air escape hole and seal it. When the vacuum chamber is opened,
    a vacuum remains between the cup’s walls.

  zh: 在这一点上，必须在将杯子从真空室中取出之前封闭用于排气的孔。铅焊料提供了可靠且成本效益高的解决方案。在内外层组装过程中，在排气孔上方放置一个小铅球。将空气抽出杯子后，稍微加热真空室，足以使铅熔化，使其流入排气孔并将其封闭。当真空室打开时，杯壁之间保持真空状态。
- en: In our CT scans, we can clearly see the inner and outer stainless steel flask
    layers, as well as the solder point. We also see a metal disk attached to a welded
    tab, which may be a component used to position the solder and hold it in place
    before it’s melted. Dense materials or those made of elements with higher atomic
    numbers attenuate (absorb or scatter) X-rays more. Lead is very dense and tends
    to block X-rays, which is why it’s used to protect people from X-ray radiation.
    In [Voyager](https://www.lumafield.com/products/voyager-ai-powered-cloud-analysis-software),
    we’ve applied a color map to the reconstruction that corresponds to the range
    of material attenuation coefficients. Lead, the most attenuating, appears here
    as a solid red. The scan shows that the lead solder is completely shielded by
    a stainless steel cover just below it.

  zh: 在我们的CT扫描中，我们可以清楚地看到内部和外部的不锈钢烧瓶层，以及焊点。我们还看到一个连接到焊接标签的金属盘，可能是用于定位焊料并在熔化之前固定它的组件。密度大或由原子序数较高的元素制成的材料更能衰减（吸收或散射）X射线。铅非常密集并且倾向于阻挡X射线，这就是为什么它被用来保护人们免受X射线辐射的原因。在[Voyager](https://www.lumafield.com/zh/products/voyager-ai-powered-cloud-analysis-software)，我们已经应用了一种颜色映射到重建中，对应于材料衰减系数的范围。铅，最大的衰减材料，在这里显示为纯红色。扫描显示，铅焊料完全被位于其下方的不锈钢盖屏蔽。

    surface of any Stanley product that comes into contact with the consumer nor the

- en: Leaded solder, despite its known health risks, remains widely used in various
    industries, including electronics, due to its superior workability and lower melting
    point compared to unleaded alternatives. The Stanley revelation has sparked a
    debate on the difficult trade-offs manufacturers face between continuing with
    a well-established but potentially harmful material or investing in the development
    of safer—albeit more expensive and technically challenging—alternatives.

  zh: 尽管已知铅焊料存在健康风险，但由于其优越的可加工性和较低的熔点，它仍广泛应用于包括电子在内的各行业。斯坦利的揭示引发了一个关于制造商在继续使用一个成熟但潜在有害材料与投资开发更安全（尽管更昂贵和技术上更具挑战性）替代品之间难以权衡的辩论。
- en: In response to the controversy, other reusable water bottle companies have been
    highlighting their lead-free manufacturing processes. Brands like Owala, Hydro
    Flask, and Klean Kanteen have successfully eliminated lead from their products,
    opting for alternative materials such as noncrystalline silica beads or proprietary
    sealants. These companies demonstrate that while the transition to lead-free manufacturing
    is complex and costly, it is feasible and aligns with growing consumer demand
    for environmentally friendly and safe products.

  zh: 面对争议，其他可重复使用水瓶公司一直在强调其无铅制造工艺。Owala、Hydro Flask和Klean Kanteen等品牌已成功地从其产品中消除铅，选择了非晶态硅珠或专有密封剂等替代材料。这些公司证明，尽管向无铅制造的过渡复杂且昂贵，但是可行的，并且符合消费者对环境友好和安全产品日益增长的需求。
- en: As consumers become more discerning about the products they buy, the pressure
    on companies to not compromise on safety or sustainability will only increase.
    Perhaps just as important as continued innovation is educating consumers on the
    relative risks associated with materials and manufacturing processes. Proactively
    demystifying the product's lifecycle and design choices could mean the difference
    between soaring success and a viral backlash.
