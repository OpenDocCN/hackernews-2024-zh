    principle of physics that you might have heard at school, but your teacher may
    have been wrong.'

- en: Researchers from the University of Oxford's chemistry department found that
    like-charged particles submerged in solutions were able to attract each other
    from long distances, depending on the solvent used and the sign of the charge.

    such as how medicines and chemicals stay stable or how certain diseases develop.
    They also discovered a way to measure properties of the electrical charge caused
    by solvents, which was previously thought impossible.

    in a solution and discovered that these particles did indeed attract each other,
    forming hexagonally arranged clusters when they did.

    present in water that outweighs the usual electrostatic repulsion, allowing these
    clusters to form.

    by varying the Ph (acidity). However, no matter what the Ph was, the positively
    charged particles still did not attract.

    charged silica particles forming these clusters, while negatively charged particles
    did not.

    but crucial role in interparticle interactions, and importantly, that interactions

    at long range while positively charged particles repel. In solvents that exhibit
    an inversion of the net molecular dipole at an interface, such as alcohols, we
    find that the converse can be true: positively charged particles may attract whereas
