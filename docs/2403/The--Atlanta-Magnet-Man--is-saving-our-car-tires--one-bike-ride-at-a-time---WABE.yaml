- en: Known as the “[Atlanta Magnet Man](https://www.instagram.com/atlantamagnetman),”
    Alex Benigno bikes around Atlanta with a hitched trailer that uses magnets to
    attract metal debris that poses a risk to people’s car tires. The idea is completely
    his own, and he does it for free.

    pandemic when roads were empty.

    he realized how many more drivers would be affected when traffic conditions returned
    to normal, he worked to find a solution.

    “I’ll do just random stuff to help improve things that will benefit random people
    that I’ve never met before … it’s just so that I can do a little thing to fix
    something so somebody doesn’t suffer down the road.”

    months of trial and error, he found the perfect configuration for the trailer
    and has been riding consistently since last December.

- en: Nearly every day, Benigno bikes about 10 miles and picks up around six pounds
    of debris — about the max the magnets can carry. Over the course of eight weeks,
    he collected over 410 pounds of metal, recently donating it to a local scrap artist.

    followers since January. His most popular video, with nearly 2 million views on
    Instagram, shows footage of the magnets as he bikes along I-285 and S. Atlanta
    Road.

    he was able to cover the cost of a bike lane sweeper prototype. And although he’s
    not motivated to make a fortune, he said it’d be cool just to earn a living wage
    cleaning streets full-time.

    Force bases, it would be impossible to use them on streets riddled with metal
    plates, grates and manhole covers. Benigno is able to dodge those obstacles on
    a bike — usually. And while Atlanta does quarterly street sweeping, metal debris
    still falls through the cracks.

    both play a part in the safety of the streets. Atlanta’s transportation department [budget

    12% last year. She said that about $50 million is three times less than peer cities.

    says the city doesn’t have street sweepers that can reach separated bike lanes,
    so all sorts of debris don’t get cleaned and pose a risk to people in motion.
