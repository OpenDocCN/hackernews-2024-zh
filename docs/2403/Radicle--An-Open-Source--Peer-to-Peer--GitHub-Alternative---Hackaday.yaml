- en: The actions of certain large social networks have recently highlighted how a
    small number of people possess significant power over the masses and how this
    power is sometimes misused. Consequently, there has been a surge in the development
    of federated (or decentralized) services, such as Mastodon and Matrix.  But what
    about development? While GitHub and similar services are less likely to be used
    for political manipulation, they are still centralized services with a common
    failure point. [Radicle is an open-source, peer-to-peer collaboration stack](https://radicle.xyz)
    built on top of Git but backed with public key cryptography as a standard and
    a [gossip protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gossip_protocol) to ensure widespread
    data sharing across the network and, thus, some fault tolerance.

    with an identity. The [Git protocol](https://git-scm.com/docs/protocol-v2) is
    used for actual data transfer from peer-to-peer, which means that updates are
    only sent as deltas, not complete copies, maximizing channel bandwidth efficiency.
    A custom gossip protocol is used for metadata transfer around the network of peers.
    The projects had a local-first ideology, with users running a full-stack node
    on their hardware and all features available, even offline, which is great for
    laptop users who move around locations with sporadic access to the internet.

    it is worth diving in and seeing if it floats your boat. Fancy getting onto the
    Fediverse, but only have a spare MS-DOS machine to try it on? [We’ve got it covered](https://hackaday.com/2023/08/09/ms-dos-meets-the-fediverse/).
    Want to use Git but not online? [You need a private Git server](https://hackaday.com/2018/06/27/keep-it-close-a-private-git-server-crash-course/).
    Finally, too much Git? [How about Gitless](https://hackaday.com/2023/06/18/too-much-git-try-gitless/)?
