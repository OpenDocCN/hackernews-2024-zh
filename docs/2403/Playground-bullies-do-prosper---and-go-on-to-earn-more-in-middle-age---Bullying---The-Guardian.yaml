    whose lives have been tracked by the [British Cohort Study](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2021/jul/28/a-third-of-middle-aged-uk-adults-have-at-least-two-chronic-health-issues-study).
    The research team examined data from primary school teachers who assessed the
    children’s social and emotional skills when they were 10 years old in 1980, and
    matched it to their lives at the age of 46 in 2016.

    peer relationships and emotional instability did end up earning less in the future,
    as we expected, but we were surprised to find a strong link between aggressive
    behaviour at school and higher earnings in later life,” said Prof Emilia Del Bono,
    one of the study’s authors.

    adapt to win that competition with aggression, and then take that through to the

    in children in a more positive way.”

    impact on their earning potential.”
