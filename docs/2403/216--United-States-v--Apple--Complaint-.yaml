    the careers of litigators and regulators, not to mention law students aspiring
    to someday land a giant case. There is no bigger target than today’s Apple. When
    huge the AT&T breakup happened we had a guest speaker in AP Social Studies in
    1983 who worked on the case. It was wild to learn he spent almost his entire career
    on the case that had started 12 years earlier. Attorneys inside Microsoft were
    hired from law school to work on our case and retired from Microsoft having worked
    only on that case. Still, the law is based on precedent and by definition what

    stretch to define a “performance smartphones” market segment to increase Apple’s

    all of these are product choices that are entirely consistent not only with what
    other companies do (like Google’s Android + Samsung) but also with Apple’s own
    history. A key part of US antitrust law that the DOJ has to overcome is not just
    to prove Apple has a monopoly, but that it acted illegally to maintain the monopoly.
    When a company has consistent behavior as it rose from 0% to 50% share, the burden
    will be on the DOJ to argue that the same behavior is now anticompetitive in a
    specific legal sense. In other words, a lot of what the DOJ will be arguing is
    that product choices Apple clearly made to up-level the iPhone offering in terms
    of security, privacy, reliability, battery life, and more since the introduction
    of the App Store when the phone was at 10% share are today anticompetitive. The
    existence of another type of smartphone or ideas for how another type of smartphone
    should be ideally designed is not enough to prove Apple is being anticompetitive.

    iPhone 在安全性、隐私性、可靠性、电池寿命等方面的水平，今天被认为是反竞争的。存在另一种智能手机或者对如何设计另一种智能手机的理念并不足以证明苹果是反竞争的。这些设计观点不是关于你今天可能做什么，而是关于苹果自产品问世以来一直在做的事情。

    This entire idea gets into very subtle conversations about what is in the “OS”

    Internet Explorer (or Media playback and formats) and Windows which led to the
    infamous (and failure on Microsoft’s part) of “can you remove IE from Windows?”
    moment. Yes, but why? And here we are today where no OS exists without a browser.
    The only difference today is that everything that one might view as an “app” on
    the iPhone also exists on Android. So literally this is not a theory but proof

- en: The whole problem for Apple with “private APIs” is that it is obvious there
    are APIs and that means it is obvious you just make them un-private. I mean we
    can see they exist. This is nothing more than simple “product design by courts.”
    As everyone who has built software knows, it is a layered approach, and you don’t
    publish everything at every layer. Importantly, you can’t just publish a layer
    in the middle and cross your fingers. You can’t bring your own ingredients to
    a restaurant and force them on the chef and then get angry when the meal is awful.
    The right of software to have “implementation details” is real and the right for
    a product to define which parts are exposed to developers and which parts are
    not is perfectly valid, even though it is always easy to imagine exposing everything.
    This too is a different approach that Apple has taken in the market and should
    most obviously be recognized by the courts as precisely what the market is good
    at figuring out, certainly better than courts and way way better than asking other
    computer professionals to break abstractions to make *their* jobs easier. The

    community business leaders. In *[The Antitrust Paradox](https://a.co/d/9QFY0ng)*
    [by Robert Bork](https://a.co/d/9QFY0ng), the canon of antitrust law was documented
    which is that in the US law exists to protect consumers. The market will dispense
    with companies and competitors so long as consumers are protected, basically.
    While no doubt some tech enthusiasts in the US want the iPhone to be like a PC,
    the 90% case is not only do they not want that, but they are paying Apple for
    that not to happen in the face of the Android duopoly. In Europe, which has recently
    had a much more aggressive antitrust program and by many accounts is now the leader,
    the *modus operandi* is that it is the competitive marketplace and choice and
    specifically competitors that need to be protected. Many in the US would like
    to get out in front of the EU and that means protecting competitors. US law currently
    doesn’t support that and historically has proven backward looking, especially
    in technology. Changing laws is difficult. It is much better to attempt to win
    cases and legislate from case law which is what this is all about.'

    delve into product design and prefer behavioral and structural remedies rather
    than picking and choosing winning products or product approaches. That was why
    the quick leap to “break up Microsoft” got exciting as a structural remedy which
    was all the rage after breaking up AT&T. No one is expecting Apple to be broken
    up into anything. So the question will likely turn into specific policies and
    verifying those. But as the DOJ learned (maybe?) with the US v Microsoft these
    types of remedies are quickly moot in the market as all players rapidly adjust
    and technology moves forward. There is some residual bitterness there that comes
    with the absurd claims of how the case tamed Microsoft. The mess they made of
    PCs with “set programs and defaults” is kind of legendary at this point. In addition,
    I believe many of the initial claims have already been litigated and how that

- en: This actually matters because when you seek a remedy you have to consider what
    it is that is being fixed. So here the platform is the OS, but Apple is a hardware
    company too. It is also the reality that services are just software and just like
    software there are a bunch of those features that will exist on every platform
    in some form or competitive flavor or another. As an example, every mobile platform
    today has payments. That isn’t the issue. It is worth looking at the [Microsoft
    filing](https://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/atr/legacy/2012/08/09/1763.pdf)
