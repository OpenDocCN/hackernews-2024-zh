    keep in mind is that most steps in the process are legal steps—plodding, boring,
    and deeply technical from a legal perspective. A few of them are constructed for
    legal as well as public relations optics. This initial filing is mostly an optics
    step. Short of a dramatic case dismissal (which Apple will certainly file) or
    dismantling (which a judge could do in response), the filing is meant to stir
    emotions and create a broad base of public support and awareness while providing
    just enough to continue the legal journey. The effort is as much politics as it
    is legal. That’s why there are no footnotes or citations. We know because they
    quote Steve Jobs, but since he has passed and cannot be cross-examined in the
    context of this case it really isn’t there for evidence as much as the headlines.

    are unique, just as Microsoft’s case was not like AT&T, which was not like IBM,
    which was not like Standard Oil. These once-in-a-generation cases also define
    the careers of litigators and regulators, not to mention law students aspiring
    to someday land a giant case. There is no bigger target than today’s Apple. When
    huge the AT&T breakup happened we had a guest speaker in AP Social Studies in
    1983 who worked on the case. It was wild to learn he spent almost his entire career
    on the case that had started 12 years earlier. Attorneys inside Microsoft were
    hired from law school to work on our case and retired from Microsoft having worked
    only on that case. Still, the law is based on precedent and by definition what
    happened before plays a critical part in every case even if fact patterns differ.

    only applies to Apple but is deeply engrained in their own experience as the original
    leaders in the PC. Unlike Windows, not only is Apple’s position in the mobile
    phone market not a monopoly or even grossly dominant share, the DOJ even has to
    stretch to define a “performance smartphones” market segment to increase Apple’s

    all of these are product choices that are entirely consistent not only with what
    other companies do (like Google’s Android + Samsung) but also with Apple’s own
    history. A key part of US antitrust law that the DOJ has to overcome is not just
    to prove Apple has a monopoly, but that it acted illegally to maintain the monopoly.
    When a company has consistent behavior as it rose from 0% to 50% share, the burden
    will be on the DOJ to argue that the same behavior is now anticompetitive in a
    specific legal sense. In other words, a lot of what the DOJ will be arguing is
    that product choices Apple clearly made to up-level the iPhone offering in terms
    of security, privacy, reliability, battery life, and more since the introduction
    of the App Store when the phone was at 10% share are today anticompetitive. The
    existence of another type of smartphone or ideas for how another type of smartphone
    should be ideally designed is not enough to prove Apple is being anticompetitive.

    devices and the workings of the OS. This is a technically illiterate position
    to take. Dumb too. It ignores the progress of abstraction, the heart and soul
    of computing. Much of this argument falls apart as the complaint even claims that
    Apple knows what to do since it did so on Mac. It is so dumb I won’t even quote
    the filing to spare embarrassing DOJ further. Perhaps people are confused because
    Apple used a PC OS as the foundation of iPhone, but as we all know software always

    As everyone who has built software knows, it is a layered approach, and you don’t
    publish everything at every layer. Importantly, you can’t just publish a layer
    in the middle and cross your fingers. You can’t bring your own ingredients to
    a restaurant and force them on the chef and then get angry when the meal is awful.
    The right of software to have “implementation details” is real and the right for
    a product to define which parts are exposed to developers and which parts are
    not is perfectly valid, even though it is always easy to imagine exposing everything.
    This too is a different approach that Apple has taken in the market and should
    most obviously be recognized by the courts as precisely what the market is good
    at figuring out, certainly better than courts and way way better than asking other
    computer professionals to break abstractions to make *their* jobs easier. The

    against big tech spans administrations. It is true the Microsoft case was filed
    when Bill Clinton was President and Bill Gates and Bill Clinton were not strangers.
    At the same time, as the head Microsoft lawyer once told me, the career antitrust
    attorneys in DOJ didn’t specialize in the area and take a government salary to
    **not** take on the big targets. They are going to find a reason to do that. The
    ability and support to do so waxes and wanes with administrations but they are
    always there and in this case for entirely different reasons both sides of the
    aisle had a lot of interest in going after all the major technology players.

    law beyond what it is today.** Keep in mind they are *antitrust* lawyers, not
    community business leaders. In *[The Antitrust Paradox](https://a.co/d/9QFY0ng)*
    [by Robert Bork](https://a.co/d/9QFY0ng), the canon of antitrust law was documented
    which is that in the US law exists to protect consumers. The market will dispense
    with companies and competitors so long as consumers are protected, basically.
    While no doubt some tech enthusiasts in the US want the iPhone to be like a PC,
    the 90% case is not only do they not want that, but they are paying Apple for
    that not to happen in the face of the Android duopoly. In Europe, which has recently
    had a much more aggressive antitrust program and by many accounts is now the leader,
    the *modus operandi* is that it is the competitive marketplace and choice and
    specifically competitors that need to be protected. Many in the US would like
    to get out in front of the EU and that means protecting competitors. US law currently
    doesn’t support that and historically has proven backward looking, especially
    in technology. Changing laws is difficult. It is much better to attempt to win
    cases and legislate from case law which is what this is all about.'

    and remedies, so where will it lead.** The case will get narrowed over time as
    a matter of course. In general, at least what is said, US courts do not like to
    delve into product design and prefer behavioral and structural remedies rather
    than picking and choosing winning products or product approaches. That was why
    the quick leap to “break up Microsoft” got exciting as a structural remedy which
    was all the rage after breaking up AT&T. No one is expecting Apple to be broken
    up into anything. So the question will likely turn into specific policies and
    verifying those. But as the DOJ learned (maybe?) with the US v Microsoft these
    types of remedies are quickly moot in the market as all players rapidly adjust
    and technology moves forward. There is some residual bitterness there that comes
    with the absurd claims of how the case tamed Microsoft. The mess they made of
    PCs with “set programs and defaults” is kind of legendary at this point. In addition,
    I believe many of the initial claims have already been litigated and how that
    is dealt with will be important. I suspect there will be lots of early legal work
    on making the case coherent while also reminding the court that the facts have
    been litigated.'

    Stay true. The biggest advice (if I could) offer is stay true. Don’t change anything
    now. You do not have to. Products change when the case ends, and only if you lose
    parts or settle the case. The way to mess up now is to act as though you’re guilty

    as it could not be clearer why Apple did what it did. And this was before the
    iPad and long before PWAs or large smartphone share. Apple had less than 15% share
    when it drew the line at these runtimes. Yes it is the case that behavior is different
    when there is large share and if anything Apple is far more lax today with HTML
    and other extensions to single apps.

    at all. I can imagine the lawyers sitting on Zoom getting all excited by the phrase
    “Super Apps” and the idea Apple blocks them, just like every time someone said
    “standards” and assumed Microsoft hated standards. Blocking something “super”
    seems really anti-consumer which is obviously why this is mentioned. That policies
    might differ in China is only a bonus. It isn’t about law but what narrative feels
    better. If one were to get DOJ to really prioritize the value of these 5 areas
    when it comes to impact they hope to achieve there’s no way Super Apps would be
    first.
