    lack of family history (-5%). Putin hasn’t vanished from the world stage for long
    periods of time, which seems about 4x more likely to be true if he didn’t have
    cancer than if he did. About half of cancer patients lose their hair, and Putin
    hasn’t, so we’ll divide by two. On the other hand, Putin’s face has gotten more
    swollen recently, which happens about six times more often to cancer patients

    was tested in, including the usual coronavirus intermediate hosts (pangolins,
    raccoon-dogs, etc), it was best at infecting human cells. Further, a virus that
    enters a new species will usually show a burst of mutations as it “figures out”
    the best way to adapt to that species’ unique biology. But COVID has had a pretty
    constant mutation rate in humans, from the beginning of the pandemic to the end.
    That suggests it was already adapted to humans. This could be because the lab
    screened for viruses with existing adaptations, because they passed it through
    humanized mice in the lab, or because it adapted in the hundreds of undetected
    cases that happened between the lab and detection in the wet market.

    times the virus gets confused between its own RNA and its host’s, and splices

    in viruses. On the other hand, it’s not *that* rare in viruses - COVID uses CGG
    for arginine about 3% of the time. And human engineers don’t necessarily use it

    furin cleavage site which no human has ever used before, and which virologists
    expected to work poorly. They later found that an adjacent part of COVID’s genome
    twisted the protein in an unusual way that allowed PRRAR to be a viable furin
    cleavage site, but this discovery took a lot of computer power, and was only made
    after COVID became important. The Wuhan virologists supposedly doing gain-of-function
    research on COVID shouldn’t have known this would work. Why didn’t they just use
    the standard RRKR site, which would have worked better? Everyone thinks it works
    better! Even the virus eventually decided it worked better - sometime during the

    enough about the correlations between stages. For example, maybe there’s only
    1/10 odds that the Wuhan scientists would choose the suboptimal RRAR furin cleavage
    site. And maybe there’s only 1/20 odds that they would add a proline in front
    to make it PRRAR. But are these really two separate forms of weirdness, such that
    we can multiply them together and get 1/200? Or are scientists who do one weird

    providing any other evidence of their existence.” Imaginary-Peter says “John Smith
    of Topeka saw a UFO at 4:52 PM on 6/12/2010, and everyone agrees he’s an honorable
    person who wouldn’t lie, so what’s your explanation of that?” Saar says “I don’t

    records and geolocated him to coordinates XYZ, which is a mosque. My analysis
    finds that he’s there on 99.5% of Islamic holy days, which proves he’s a very
    religious Muslim. And religious Muslims don’t drink! Your argument is invalid!”

    point. On the other, imaginary-Saar never really claimed to have a great explanation
    for this particular UFO sighting, and his argument doesn’t depend on it. Instead

    一方面，虚构的彼得非常令人印象深刻，确实打破了萨尔的观点。另一方面，虚构的萨尔从未真正声称对这次特定的UFO目击有一个很好的解释，并且他的论点并不依赖于此。与其争论史密斯是否可能喝醉了，我们需要放大视角，意识到外星人的解释毫无意义。

    the most interesting place - sounds like 30,000-to-one odds against”. Against
    that, a virus with a boring insertion would never have become a pandemic, so maybe
    you need to multiply this by however much viral evolution is going on in weird
    caves in Laos, and then you would get the odds that at least *one* virus would
    have an insertion interesting enough to go global. Neither participant calculated

    this a factor of 30 in his analysis. Since Peter gave it a *higher* factor of

- en: The first mistake is conflating Bayes factors with conditional probabilities.
    1/10000 is the supposed conditional probability p(HSM|Lab Leak), That should be
    divided by the conditional probability of HSM under Zoonosis. Markets were not
    identified as a high-risk location prior to this outbreak (This will be elaborated
    in the full response), and in SARS1 the spillovers were mostly at restaurants
    and other food handlers that deal more closely with wildlife.

  zh: 第一个错误是将贝叶斯因子与条件概率混淆。1/10000是假设的条件概率p(HSM|实验室泄漏)，这应该除以HSM在兽源性下的条件概率。在这次爆发之前，市场没有被确定为高风险地点（这将在完整回应中详细说明），而在SARS1中，溢出主要发生在餐馆和其他更密切接触野生动物的食品处理者身上。
- en: While it's cool to point to the raccoon dog photo, that was a result of a retrospective
    search (we don't know what other photos they took which in retrospect would be
    brought up as premonition). Unbiased data shows markets are not a likely spillover
    location for zoonosis. We originally estimated p(HSM|Zoonosis)<0.1\. Following
    more research we did to answer Scott's questions, this is more likely <0.03.

- en: Even if it's unclear how strong HSM is as an amplifier, it is clearly not some
    random location, with its high traffic (that alone should be at least 10x), many
    permanent residents, and the recurrence of early clusters in other seafood markets.
    It's highly overconfident to claim it is less than a 1% location - It means Wuhan
    is somehow unique in that its largest seafood market is different from others
    and won't form an early cluster. So the conditional probabilities under both hypotheses

    and legitimize them. I’ve [made fun of this position before](https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/contra-kavanaugh-on-fideism),

    about 66% of Americans believe lab leak, compared to 16% who believe natural origin
    and 17% who aren’t sure. That means that people with an opinion on the issue are
    more than 4:1 in favor of lab leak. At some point you have to start debating!
    What are you waiting for? If you hold off so long that finally every single person
    in the world except you believes lab leak, would you still be sitting there, pristine

- en: The other part of the argument was that saying “I will debate all comers for
    an $X bet” is annoying, and we shouldn’t encourage that kind of thing. Certainly
    this technique has been used by bad actors - for example, the Holocaust denial
    group Institute For Historical Review offered a $50,000 prize to anyone who could
    prove the Holocaust happened (it was eventually won by an Auschwitz survivor whose
    “proof” was that he saw his family led to the gas chambers; IHR failed to accept
    this; the survivor sued and won). Likewise, anti-vaccine multimillionaire Steve
    Kirsch has offered to bet $500,000 on the results of a debate about vaccines not
    working (Saar took him up on it and they’re continuing to hammer out the specifics).

  zh: 另一个论点是说“我愿意与所有对手辩论，押上$X赌注”是很讨厌的，我们不应该鼓励这种行为。无疑，这种技术已被不良分子利用过 - 例如，否认大屠杀的组织“历史复审研究所”曾向任何能够证明大屠杀发生的人提供$50,000的奖金（最终由奥斯维辛的幸存者赢得，他的“证据”是他看到他的家人被引向毒气室；历史复审研究所拒绝接受此事；幸存者起诉并获胜）。同样，反疫苗的千万富翁史蒂夫·基尔什曾愿意在关于疫苗是否有效的辩论中押上$500,000（Saar接受了他的挑战，他们仍在继续协商具体事宜）。
- en: I assume the concern is that (if the court system hadn’t stepped in), the Institute
    for Historical Review could have kept denying any evidence they were given, then
    kept taunting people with “We’ve offered $50,000 for proof that the Holocaust
    happened, nobody has ever won our money, so the proof must not exist”. Or Kirsch
    could keep saying “Nobody will bet me $500,000 on vaccines, guess they’re scared
    and think they don’t have evidence” (when in fact it’s just that most people don’t
    have the time, courage, and risk tolerance to do this, especially when there’s
    no guarantee the right person will win the debate). In order to deny these people
    this weapon (the argument goes) we need to make it common knowledge that this
    strategy isn’t legitimate. And taking people up on their offer, having a great
    debate that leaves everybody more enlightened and serves as a model for rational
    discourse, then having the right side win in the end - seems like the opposite
    of delegitimizing this strategy.

    this time; that hasn’t changed. But this was a good reminder to also learn the
    lessons of zoonosis, for the same reason. We need more attention on closing wet
    markets and tracking weird Chinese wildlife. The DEFUSE proposal wanted to immunize
    bats - is this still a wortwhile idea? The virologists got a bad rap for wanting
    to gain-of-function exactly the pathogen that caused the century’s worst pandemic,
