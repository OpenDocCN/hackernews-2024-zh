- en: '[Microsoft](https://www.tomshardware.com/tag/microsoft) and OpenAI are reportedly
    working on a massive datacenter to house an AI-focused supercomputer featuring
    millions of GPUs. [*The Information*](https://www.theinformation.com/articles/microsoft-and-openai-plot-100-billion-stargate-ai-supercomputer?rc=bdqvyp)reports
    that the project could cost "in excess of $115 billion" and that the supercomputer,
    currently dubbed "Stargate" inside OpenAI, would be U.S.-based.'

    could be "100 times more costly" than some of the biggest operating centers today.
    Stargate would be the largest in a string of datacenter projects the two companies
    hope to build in the next six years, and executives hope to have it running by
    2028.

- en: OpenAI and Microsoft are building these supercomputers in phases, the report
    says, and that Stargate would be a phase 5 system. A phase 4 system would cost
    less and may launch as soon as 2026, *The Information*'s sources say, and may
    be looking to start in Mt. Pleasant, Wisconsin. The system could require several
    Stargate could need so much power ("at least several gigawatts") that Microsoft
    and OpenAI are considering alternative sources of power, such as nuclear.

    because the existing designs require "putting many more GPUs into a single rack
    than Microsoft is used to, to increase the chips' efficiency and performance."
    That means also devising novel ways to keep everything cool.

- en: It sounds like the companies are also potentially using this phase of design
    to move away from reliance on Nvidia. The report claims that OpenAI wants to avoid
    using Nvidia's InfiniBand cables in Stargate, even though Microsoft uses them
    in current projects. OpenAI claims it would rather use Ethernet cables.

    change and it's unclear when details will be finalized. *The Information* also
    states that it has yet to be determined where this computer will be located, and
    whether it will be built in a single datacenter or in "multiple datacenters in
    close proximity."

    build AI chips and was [looking to raise as much as $7 trillion](https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/artificial-intelligence/openai-ceo-sam-altman-seeks-dollar5-to-dollar7-trillion-to-build-a-network-of-fabs-for-ai-chips)
    to build foundries to produce them. Last year, Microsoft revealed its 128-core
    Arm datacenter CPU and Maia 100 GPUs specifically for AI projects. There have
    also been reports of Microsoft [developing its own networking gear](https://www.tomshardware.com/desktops/servers/microsoft-develops-its-own-networking-gear-for-ai-datacenters-report)
    for AI datacenters. As AI has taken off, Nvidia's GPUs have been in high demand,
     so it makes sense that companies like Microsoft and OpenAI might want to have
    some other options.

    AI 项目的 128 核 Arm 数据中心 CPU 和 Maia 100 GPU。还有报道称微软为 AI 数据中心[开发了自己的网络设备](https://www.tomshardware.com/desktops/servers/microsoft-develops-its-own-networking-gear-for-ai-datacenters-report)。随着
    AI 技术的普及，Nvidia 的 GPU 需求量大增，因此微软和 OpenAI 这样的公司希望拥有其他选择是合情合理的。
