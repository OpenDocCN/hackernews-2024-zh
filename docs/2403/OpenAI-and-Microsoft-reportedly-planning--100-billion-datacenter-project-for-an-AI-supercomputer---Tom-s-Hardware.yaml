    working on a massive datacenter to house an AI-focused supercomputer featuring
    millions of GPUs. [*The Information*](https://www.theinformation.com/articles/microsoft-and-openai-plot-100-billion-stargate-ai-supercomputer?rc=bdqvyp)reports
    that the project could cost "in excess of $115 billion" and that the supercomputer,
    currently dubbed "Stargate" inside OpenAI, would be U.S.-based.'

    could be "100 times more costly" than some of the biggest operating centers today.
    Stargate would be the largest in a string of datacenter projects the two companies
    hope to build in the next six years, and executives hope to have it running by
    2028.

    says, and that Stargate would be a phase 5 system. A phase 4 system would cost
    less and may launch as soon as 2026, *The Information*'s sources say, and may
    be looking to start in Mt. Pleasant, Wisconsin. The system could require several
    Stargate could need so much power ("at least several gigawatts") that Microsoft
    and OpenAI are considering alternative sources of power, such as nuclear.

    because the existing designs require "putting many more GPUs into a single rack
    than Microsoft is used to, to increase the chips' efficiency and performance."
    That means also devising novel ways to keep everything cool.

    to move away from reliance on Nvidia. The report claims that OpenAI wants to avoid
    using Nvidia's InfiniBand cables in Stargate, even though Microsoft uses them
    in current projects. OpenAI claims it would rather use Ethernet cables.

    change and it's unclear when details will be finalized. *The Information* also
    states that it has yet to be determined where this computer will be located, and
    whether it will be built in a single datacenter or in "multiple datacenters in
    close proximity."

    build AI chips and was [looking to raise as much as $7 trillion](https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/artificial-intelligence/openai-ceo-sam-altman-seeks-dollar5-to-dollar7-trillion-to-build-a-network-of-fabs-for-ai-chips)
    to build foundries to produce them. Last year, Microsoft revealed its 128-core
    Arm datacenter CPU and Maia 100 GPUs specifically for AI projects. There have
    also been reports of Microsoft [developing its own networking gear](https://www.tomshardware.com/desktops/servers/microsoft-develops-its-own-networking-gear-for-ai-datacenters-report)
    for AI datacenters. As AI has taken off, Nvidia's GPUs have been in high demand,
     so it makes sense that companies like Microsoft and OpenAI might want to have
    some other options.

    into its partnership with OpenAI, largely in the form of computing power to run
    its models. If Stargate or something like it comes to pass, the partnership will
    only grow deeper as the investments get larger — and more complicated.'
