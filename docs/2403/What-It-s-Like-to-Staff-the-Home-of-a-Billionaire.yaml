- en: After university, I worked in a couple of Michelin restaurants in London. From
    there, I became a private chef. The hours and compensation were far better than
    working in restaurants. It’s a massive step up from your basic hospitality job.
    For me, it was also more interesting. I was packing up at a moment’s notice, going
    to the British Virgin Islands and then Gstaad on a private jet. When I was younger
    and up for the adventure, it was very exciting. But it can also be quite turbulent.
    As I got older, I wanted something a little bit more stable with a slightly better
    work-life balance. At that point, I had worked with lots of different clients,
    and that gave me the contacts and understanding of the industry to set up the
    agency.

    two elements of their lives. One is the family office, which operates their estate.
    That could include a chief of staff, accountants, people managing their art portfolio
    or other assets across their various homes around the world. The other element
    is staffing their private household — everything from dog nannies and housekeepers
    to chauffeurs and whoever they need in order for their lives to function as smoothly
    as possible.

    Windsor Castle, very formal and stuffy backgrounds. In this day and age, most
    principals don’t want that as much — they’re not looking for butlers in a coat
    and tails. So we try not to be unnecessarily formal. We’re dealing with people
    at the end of the day. We’re fairly new, but your reputation in this industry
    is absolutely everything — it’s almost entirely referral based. So for us, it’s
    about retaining core clients and keeping our relationship with them.

    more open. To some extent, that secrecy was detrimental — it meant certain workers
    weren’t receiving basic rights. I’m very much an advocate for talking more about
    the industry. Having said that, it is littered with nondisclosure agreements.
    Obviously, you want to be very discreet. You don’t want to give away aspects of
    anyone’s personal life. But some things are up for debate. For example, if you
    work for all of these people who ask you to sign NDAs, what do you write on your
    CV?

    their former staff just for putting their name on a CV. Other people are cool
    about it. They understand it’s a stepping stone in someone’s career. In other
    cases, it’s more of a gray area. You might just say “Hollywood couple” or “ultra-high-net-worth
    individual” or whatever. It’s delicate. You’re probably not going to go up to
    your boss and say, “Hey, can I write your name on my CV?” Instead, you speak to
    their personal assistant or chief of staff. Sometimes, you can essentially describe
    exactly who it is without saying their name.

- en: The sort of people employing private household staff are in the .001 percent,
    so it’s a very small group — we’ve probably worked with somewhere between 100
    and 120 families. It’s not too difficult to get an idea of which families treat
    their staff better than others. Some have particularly bad reputations, and we
    know to steer clear. Also, before we work with anyone, we’ll always visit them
    in person. We’ll go to their property and scope it out. Typically, if someone
    on staff is leaving, we’re working to replace them and help them find their next
    role as well. So we’re trying to cover it from all angles. That’s just sort of
    common sense from a business perspective. Then, of course, we speak to many candidates,
    and they’re usually very forthcoming if a previous boss was horrible to them.
    Within a few minutes of talking to them, it becomes very clear. I’ve got no interest
    in dealing with that. I don’t want to put anyone in a bad house. If it’s going
    to mean they’re leaving in a month, then the client’s not happy, the candidate’s
    not happy, and there’s no point in wasting our time with that.

    to start. We’d have the terms signed, and then they’d go, “Actually, can you shave
    off 5 percent?” You’re talking about a couple of grand here, when your net worth
    is billions. Otherwise, if we’re in the discovery phase of working with someone
    and it starts to seem like they’re not treating their staff in the best way, or
    they have these outsize expectations, or they’re not happy to offer fair compensation,
    then we’ll say, “Look, this isn’t the right fit for us. There are other agencies
    that might be able to help you.” We’re a candidate-focused agency. If our candidates
    — the staff — aren’t happy, then they’ll go elsewhere, and then we have no business.

    I have a Saudi client who was renting a property in London, I think it was £100,000
    a week. They booked it out for three months. They brought 60 of their staff from
    Saudi Arabia all the way over to the property. It was a family of three, and they
    only went for three days. That’s an extreme, for sure, but yeah, it happens. You’ve
    got chauffeurs, you’ve got security, you’ve got dog handlers, you’ve got dog nannies.
    Recently, I was asked to fill a role for a chef, literally just for Dobermans.
    My job is to make the principal’s life as easy as possible. They’re very well
    supported, but they pay for that support quite handsomely, which is good for everyone
    involved.

    the household, it can be jarring. You’ve got the housekeepers who might’ve come
    from a less developed country, or anyone else dealing with the financial pressures
    that normal people face, compared with their employer’s vast wealth. It is a lot,
    if you think too much about it, but equally, it’s providing a really good income
    to the people who work in these households.

    I was a private chef, I wouldn’t think twice about spending a lot of money on
    groceries because I had an unlimited budget. I wouldn’t look at prices at all.
    It’s not the best habit to pick up. Ultimately, I just have to look at my bank
    balance to ground myself.

    us a good idea of who the candidate is. We do background checks. Typically, if
    someone’s been working in private households for a certain period of time, they
    know the score and will get the job done. The touchy part is matching the candidate’s
    personality to the principal’s personality. These are people in the principal’s
    most intimate space, seeing them get dressed, arguing with close family members.
    If you can’t get that personality match right, then it’s not going to work, no
    matter how qualified the candidate is. An amazing candidate for one principal
    would be a bad fit for another.

    “thank you,” not “hello,” nothing. He would text him where they were going and
    that was it — no other communication whatsoever. So everyone has their own preference
    for how much interaction they want with their staff.

    the way to go. But it can be tough, because we don’t manage our candidates after
    they take on the role. We help place them, and then we’ll stay in contact for
    a few months, but if their employer starts changing the role after that, it’s
    usually handled within the household. We do maintain relationships with the household
    personal assistants and chiefs of staff and try to provide advice, but there’s
    only so much we can do. It is very tricky arguing with a billionaire about how
    they should use their staff. At the end of the day, they’re the boss.

    We got a lot of people going, “Shit, I want to be a dog nanny!” with no qualifications.
    But for that salary, the principal wanted someone with a bit of veterinary background,
    knowledge of dog behavior, that kind of thing. But really, it was just looking
    after dogs, which is quite nice.

    Properties are held through various funds and tax havens. It’s hard to understand
    which households are looking for people. There might only be one or two roles
    open in a household every five years. It is very nuanced and very, very different
    from your typical recruitment model. It’s all about our network.

    and then they’re like, “Oh, come on. Join us.” Ultimately, you have to remember
    that you are there because they’re paying you. It’s a job. They’re not your friend.
    Obviously, you need to share compassion and empathy. Sometimes your boss needs
    you to be a shoulder to cry on. But in the back of your mind, you still need to
    know that there’s quite a clear boundary. I’ve had housekeepers come to me saying,
    “What’s going on with my principal? One minute, they’re really open with me. Then,
    as soon as their friends come over, I’m just the staff.” But I think if you remember
