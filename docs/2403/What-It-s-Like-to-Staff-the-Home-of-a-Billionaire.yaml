    there, I became a private chef. The hours and compensation were far better than
    working in restaurants. It’s a massive step up from your basic hospitality job.
    For me, it was also more interesting. I was packing up at a moment’s notice, going
    to the British Virgin Islands and then Gstaad on a private jet. When I was younger
    and up for the adventure, it was very exciting. But it can also be quite turbulent.
    As I got older, I wanted something a little bit more stable with a slightly better
    work-life balance. At that point, I had worked with lots of different clients,
    and that gave me the contacts and understanding of the industry to set up the

  zh: 我们曾经在阿尔卑斯山组织过一个派对。大约有200人参加，我们让大量的短期员工飞到那里。从管家到服务员、厨师，应有尽有——我想大约有40名员工。我们安排他们住在三四个小木屋里，但就在活动前一天，他们全部得了胃病。我们在整个阿尔卑斯山寻找员工，几乎动用了我们所有的人脉关系，才勉强完成了这个派对。我们勉强成功了，但那真的很可怕。幸运的是，每个人都康复了，没事了，但那时真的很紧张。

- en: Basically, you have to talk to someone else who works within the industry. Otherwise
    it can be quite isolating. Lots of house managers are like, “How do I decompress?
    I can’t talk about my day to anyone because I have to be discreet.” Your boss
    could be in a really bad mood and say, “I hate you. This is rubbish,” but you
    just put up with it. It’s not the same as a corporate role where you’ve got an
    HR department. But there has to be more scope to allow your boss to be in a bad
    mood because you are in their intimate space. It is not them at work.

  zh: 基本上，你必须与同行交谈。否则会感到相当孤立。许多家庭经理会说：“我该怎么释放压力？我不能与任何人谈论我的一天，因为我必须保密。” 你的老板可能心情很糟糕，说：“我讨厌你。这简直糟透了，”但你只能忍受。这与企业职位不同，那里有人力资源部门。但必须有更多的空间来允许你的老板因为你在他们的私人空间而感到心情不好。这不是他们在工作。

- en: A few years into my private-chef career, I became more aware that there’s a
    line, and it’s best for everyone if that line isn’t crossed. But it gets blurry
    for sure. Say you’re on a yacht with your principal and they had a few tequilas,
    and then they’re like, “Oh, come on. Join us.” Ultimately, you have to remember
    that you are there because they’re paying you. It’s a job. They’re not your friend.
    Obviously, you need to share compassion and empathy. Sometimes your boss needs
    you to be a shoulder to cry on. But in the back of your mind, you still need to
    know that there’s quite a clear boundary. I’ve had housekeepers come to me saying,
    “What’s going on with my principal? One minute, they’re really open with me. Then,
    as soon as their friends come over, I’m just the staff.” But I think if you remember
    from the beginning that you’re there to do a service, you won’t get offended later
    on.

  zh: 在我做私人厨师的职业生涯的几年后，我意识到有一条界线，最好是所有人都不要越过那条界线。但这确实很模糊。比如说你和你的雇主一起在游艇上，他们喝了几杯龙舌兰，然后说：“噢，来吧，加入我们。”
    最终，你必须记住你在那里是因为他们付钱给你。这是一份工作。他们不是你的朋友。显然，你需要分享同情和理解。有时候你的老板需要你作为他们的倾诉对象。但在你的脑海里，你仍然需要知道有一条相当清晰的界限。我曾经有过家政人员来找我说：“我的雇主怎么了？一会儿他们对我非常开放，一会儿，一旦他们的朋友来了，我就成了只是员工。”
    但我认为如果你从一开始就记得你在这里是为了提供服务，你以后就不会感到被冒犯。

    But I don’t want them to be disappointed when guests arrive and suddenly it’s,
    “Can you get me a glass of Champagne, please?”
