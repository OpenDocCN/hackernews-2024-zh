    the hell out of Windows users: pop-up ads in your browser! The latest Windows
    update was released several days ago, though I only got around to it today, and
    after installation inserts pop-up adverts into Google Chrome.'

    right corner of the browser, advertising the Bing search engine and BingAI. My
    first thought was that I''d downloaded something malicious, perhaps while fiddling
    with mods, because the pop-up didn''t exactly look classy, more like the kind
    of thing you see on suspicious websites. But I set off a quick antivirus scan
    and googled the issue (in Chrome naturally), and quickly found plenty of folk
    complaining about the same thing.'

    stranglehold on the OS market, and is therefore able to intrude on our PC experience
    like few other companies (outside perhaps Google itself). This particular pop-up
    will, if you click "yes" to its prompt, set Bing as the default search engine
    within Chrome.'

    over the top of other apps](https://www.theverge.com/2023/8/30/23851902/microsoft-bing-popups-windows-11-malware)
    suggesting Microsoft-made alternatives, before removing them due to "unintended

    they should only appear once. Well, I've seen at least two, and frankly don't
    trust Redmond on this, because it's just always coming up with new ways to taint
    the Windows experience.

    default search engine on Chrome," Microsoft comms director [Caitlin Roulston told
    The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/15/24101887/microsoft-bing-popups-windows-11-google-chrome).
    Almost unbelievably she frames this as a perk for users, who get some Copilot
    bonuses if they accept the BingAI prompt, then ends with this magnificently brazen
    claim: "We value providing our customers with choice, so there is an option to
    dismiss the notification."'

    time, but seems to override them on a whim in certain updates and make my machine
    start doing things Microsoft wants but I don't want. I wouldn't be so bothered
    about Microsoft's various attempts to fool me into using Bing if I could just
    say "no thanks" at some point and have that respected over multiple updates.

    annoying over recent years, like when it added those [irritating pictures to Windows
    search bar](https://www.pcgamer.com/how-to-banish-those-irritating-pictures-from-your-windows-search-bar/),
    or tried to add [a Bing and Edge searchbox to your taskbar](https://www.pcgamer.com/the-latest-windows-11-preview-feature-is-a-bing-and-edge-exclusive-search-box-on-your-desktop/).
    It's done updates that automatically launch an Edge browser session once complete,
    and just generally every time there's an update I wonder what fresh torture Microsoft's
    engineers have come up with. Hell, it's enough to [make you nostalgic for Clippy](https://www.pcgamer.com/clippy-did-nothing-wrong/).
