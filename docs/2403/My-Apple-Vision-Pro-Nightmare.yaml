- en: I made a lot of questionable purchases as a teenage gadget geek in the 1990s,
    but the one that made my parents most regret giving me a credit card was the Sony
    Glasstron. The flimsy head-mounted display (which offered the "stunning" clarity
    of 800 x 600 pixels), the attached earbuds, and the video cable tether were all
    mine for the low, low price of $2,599 in 1999 dollars — or nearly $5K today. When
    the device arrived, delight turned to disappointment, and it was quickly returned.
    But my obsession with portable displays never went away. To me, it felt inevitable
    that we were on an evolutionary path toward perfect human-machine interfaces,
    erasing the separation between the infinite creativity of digital spaces and the
    limitations of our physical world.

    while wearing a display set in the middle of the Apple Store, I was shepherded
    through photos and 3D movies that suddenly spooled out around me in an effect
    that was truly transporting. Perhaps the most thrilling part was the moment I
    adjusted the simulated environment around me. In one movement, the crowded store
    faded, and a white sand dune came into view, the noise around me faded as I could
    hear the mock wind. It felt like the first time I had turned on noise-canceling
    headphones, that magical feeling of an invisible shell cloaking me from the outside
    world. But the first red flag came a few minutes later when the serenity was interrupted
    by the voice of an Apple employee, asking a man nearby whether he knew me and
    the other people testing the Vision Pro, a man who had been filming all of us
    without our consent. A man I never saw. After a brief argument, their voices faded,
    but it was a jarring reminder that while I might not have been able to see the
    world around me, it could still see me, and blinding myself to reality came at
