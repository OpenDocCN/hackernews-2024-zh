    strategy was to invest in content and community, because that’s where the top
    of the funnel is, and it’s good for business. They didn’t just talk this way,
    they were obviously *investing* in content and community. There is a chance CSS-Tricks

    be on the homepage forever, a *very* strange bit of content to emblazon the tombstone

    yadda yadda. But I’m actually fairly pleased that the site is still online, relatively
    untouched, and with everybody’s bylines, including my own, intact. That’s a better
    outcome than scotch.io, purchased from Chris Sev, which was neutered and ultimately
    turned off. That’s a much more inglorious ending that I hope never happens to
    CSS-Tricks.

    I know they were very interested in porting the content to their own internal
    SSG system. As someone who has built a lot of SSG-powered sites and a lot of WordPress-sites,
    all I can say is CSS-Tricks is WordPress-y*-as-hell,* and I cannot possibly imagine
    a conversion that maintains any level of quality as being worth the effort.

    I have no clue. It can’t *help*, but I’m sure if it was *that* big of a deal they
    would prioritize fixing it somehow. It seems more likely it’s a *oh well you win
    some you lose some shrug it off situation*. It’s almost certainly not acting as
    that strong top-of-funnel player they originally were hoping for it.

    at DigitalOcean who came over from the Cloudways acquisition. I think “ownership”
    of CSS-Tricks kinda fell is his lap after some internal shifts. Unlike his predecessors,
    he didn’t have any hangups about just talking directly to me. What he originally
    wanted was just to learn what it’s going to take to get spun back up and producing
    again. A “return on investment” is what he was after, understandably. I was as
    frank with him as I am with anyone: It’s gonna take a lot. They would need a new
    lead editor, and you might be able to see how people might be squeamish about
    that role with the last one publicly axed not long ago. *Maybe* that person knows
    WordPress development pretty well? If not, ideally, you have someone know that
    knows WordPress pretty well, because the site uses [everything](https://css-tricks.com/css-tricks-is-a-poster-child-wordpress-site/).
    And maybe that person knows how to wrangle up really good front-end specific writers?
    If you find that magical person, that’s a developer, writer, community builder,
    and site-running editor, it’s going to be expensive. More likely you gotta build
    a team again, and it’s going to take them a while to get things going, so your
    investment gets deeper and deeper, while the return remains unclear.'
