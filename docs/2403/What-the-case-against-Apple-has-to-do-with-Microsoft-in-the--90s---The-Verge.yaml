    Apple](/2024/3/21/24107659/apple-doj-lawsuit-antitrust-documents-suing), there’s
    a cool reminder to the company: you’re here because we paved the way.'

    for Apple — then teetering on bankruptcy — to launch its breakout success: the
    iPod. Decades and trillions of dollars later, Apple is in the hot seat. And because
    time is a flat circle, it’s facing an antitrust case built directly on that 1999
    case against Microsoft.'

    States v. Microsoft*](https://www.justice.gov/atr/case/us-v-microsoft-corporation-browser-and-middleware#district).
    If you were a teen in the ’90s (or maybe not yet born — in which case, good for
    you), you *may* have missed this landmark antitrust case, but here’s the short
    version: Microsoft got nervous about the rise of the web and used its position
    as a monopoly to squash would-be competitors, most notably, Netscape.'

    detail how Microsoft first tried to persuade Netscape not to build a web browser
    for Windows 95, then attempted to control the company by offering it a “special
    relationship.” When that failed, Microsoft turned to the “cut off its air supply”
    page of the playbook, giving Internet Explorer away for free with Windows and
    making deals / threats in order to exclude Netscape from important distribution
    channels through other manufacturers. If you’re keeping score at home, this is,
    in fact, *illegal,* courtesy of the Sherman Antitrust Act.

    That didn’t end up happening, but Microsoft walked away from the trial weakened
    and with [a long list of “prohibited conduct”](https://www.justice.gov/atr/case-document/final-judgment-133)
    instructing the company to refrain from anticompetitive shenanigans in its dealings
    with OEMs and developers. [*Wired*’srecounting of the case from 2000](https://www.wired.com/2000/11/microsoft-7/)
    is a fascinating read on the whole thing.

    a crossplatform version of the iPod and iTunes for Microsoft’s Windows operating
    system, at the time the dominant operating system for personal computers. In the
    absence of the consent decree in United States v. Microsoft, it would have been
    more difficult for Apple to achieve this success and ultimately launch the iPhone.

    the consent decree, Apple developed a version for Windows, and the iPod started
    going gangbusters. The rest is... history? I’m not really sure Apple owes the
    DOJ a thank-you card for making the iPhone possible, but not having to deal with
    Microsoft’s bullying along the way didn’t hurt.

    weird word: middleware. Microsoft’s control over middleware — software that allows
    *other software* to run on the operating system, like web browsers or media players
    — was at the heart of *US v. Microsoft*. The DOJ concluded that Microsoft used
    various bullying tactics to keep other companies from developing middleware that
    would compete with or draw developer attention away from its own platforms — [threatening

    kind of middleware that can host apps, services, and experiences without requiring
    developers to use the iPhone’s APIs or code.” They really haven’t taken off in
    the US; the closest thing we have might be the Uber app, where you can request
    a ride, order dinner, and reserve an e-bike all in one place. But [true super
    apps as they exist in other markets](/22738395/social-media-super-app-facebook-wechat-shopping)
    just aren’t a thing here, no doubt in part becauseApple doesn’t allow them on
    iOS. The DOJ argues that this is because Apple sees them as a threat to its platform
    — and that Apple blocking them is a major impediment to innovation.

    Microsoft at the height of its power. Microsoft saw the rise of the web coming
    and realized its dominance was threatened. The DOJ portrays Apple seeing a similar
    problem as the iPhone gained success: “Apple’s internal documents show that, soon
    after the iPhone’s introduction and notwithstanding its success, the company began
    to fear that disintermediation of its platform and the commoditization of the
    iPhone would threaten Apple’s substantial profits from iPhone sales and related
    revenue streams.”'

    what Apple fears for the iPhone. Microsoft was absolutely right to be afraid —
    and it seems Apple is, too.
