- en: 'Investigation of the two index patients revealed that both persons had consumed
    a special sushi roll containing salmon and morel mushrooms. Morels were a new
    menu ingredient and were the only ingredient unique to the special sushi roll,
    making it an early suspected source of the outbreak. The morels were prepared
    in various ways during March 27–April 17\. On April 8, morels were served partially
    cooked: a hot boiled sauce was poured over the raw morels, after which they were
    marinated for 75 minutes. On April 17, the morels were uncooked and cold-marinated
    before serving. During an inspection of restaurant A on April 18, food samples
    were collected, including salmon and morel pieces remaining from the original
    packaging. Multiple violations were identified at the time of inspection, including
    temperature control issues, improper time control and sanitization procedures,
    and improper storage of personal items. On the basis of the thorough environmental
    inspection and collection of food samples, clinical presentation of index patients,
    and early evidence implicating a specific food item, investigators determined
    that environmental sample collection was not necessary. On April 19, restaurant
    A informed GCCHD that it had received four additional telephone calls from patrons
    reporting illness after consumption of the special sushi roll. Other patrons reported
    illness directly to GCCHD throughout the investigation.'

- en: After a May 3 press release providing an update on the outbreak and soliciting
    additional cases, GCCHD continued to receive reports of gastrointestinal illness
    related to eating at restaurant A between March 28 and April 17\. In total, the
    investigation identified 51 cases of illness* (including five cases among employees
    and 46 among restaurant patrons); of these cases, four ill persons visited a hospital
    emergency department, three were hospitalized, and the two index patients died
    (including one who sought emergency care but was not hospitalized). Among the
    51 ill persons, 45 (88%) reported consumption of morels at restaurant A. Review
    of medical records for the three persons who were hospitalized and one person
    who sought emergency medical care without hospitalization revealed that the onset
    of gastrointestinal symptoms was rapid, with a median symptom onset of 1 hour
    after the restaurant meal. Vomiting and diarrhea were reportedly profuse, and
    hospitalized patients had clinical evidence of dehydration. The two patients who
    died had chronic underlying medical conditions that might have affected their
    ability to tolerate massive fluid loss.

    separate distributor that supplied mushrooms to multiple states. The morel mushrooms
    were cultivated and imported fresh from China. FDA and the California Department
    of Public Health contacted 12 California facilities that received morels from
    the same importer during January 1–May 17, 2023, six of which responded to the
    inquiries and reported receiving no illness complaints from patrons who ate morels
    prepared and served by those facilities. All six facilities reported cooking or
    otherwise thoroughly heating the morels before they were served. A CDC Epidemic
    Information Exchange (Epi-X) multistate call for cases did not result in additional
    case reports.

- en: To identify foods associated with illness and assess a possible dose-response
    relationship, MTDPHHS and GCCHD, with support from CDC, conducted a matched case-control
    study. A questionnaire solicited demographic and symptom information and food
    items consumed.^¶ A case was defined as the occurrence of diarrhea, nausea, vomiting,
    or abdominal pain in a person any time after eating at restaurant A during March
    27–April 18, 2023\. Cases were identified through reports received by restaurant
    A, public health departments, and case-patient interviews. Control participants
    were identified during case-patient interviews as dining partners who did not
    report illness after eating at restaurant A. Case-patients (or a proxy) and control
    participants were interviewed during May 4–12, 2023.

    to CDC for analysis. CDC personnel conducted matched and unmatched logistic regression
    analyses using SAS software (version 9.4; SAS Institute). This activity was reviewed
    by CDC, deemed not research, and was conducted consistent with applicable federal
    law and CDC policy.**

    questionnaire and were included in analyses, representing 29 unique dining parties.
    Overall, 27 (36.9%) case-patients were female and 31 (75.6%) were aged 20–49 years.
    A majority reported diarrhea (37; 90.2%), nausea (34; 82.9%), abdominal pain (28;
    68.3%), loss of appetite (25; 61.0%), fatigue (24; 58.5%), vomiting (22; 53.7%),
    and abdominal distension (22; 53.7%) ([Table 1](#T1_down)).

    the special sushi roll with morels among case-patients were 15.78 times higher
    than the corresponding odds among control participants ([Table 2](#T2_down)).
    In addition, the odds of eating any morels among case-patients were 10.77 times
    higher than the corresponding odds among control participants. Other foods did
    not appear to be associated with case status.

    the association was positive between a one-piece increase in consumption of the
    special sushi roll and case status in all analyses (Table 2). When the special
    sushi roll was modeled as a three-level categorical variable (none, one–three
    pieces of a roll, and four pieces of a roll or more), associations in the unmatched
    models also suggested a dose-response relationship.^(§§)

    the special sushi roll (yes versus no) among 27 case-patients and 18 control participants
    were higher among those who ate at the restaurant on April 17, when uncooked morels
    were served, relative to April 8, when the morels reportedly underwent a partial
    cooking process ([Table 3](#T3_down)).
