- en: 'Investigation of the two index patients revealed that both persons had consumed
    a special sushi roll containing salmon and morel mushrooms. Morels were a new
    menu ingredient and were the only ingredient unique to the special sushi roll,
    making it an early suspected source of the outbreak. The morels were prepared
    in various ways during March 27–April 17\. On April 8, morels were served partially
    cooked: a hot boiled sauce was poured over the raw morels, after which they were
    marinated for 75 minutes. On April 17, the morels were uncooked and cold-marinated
    before serving. During an inspection of restaurant A on April 18, food samples
    were collected, including salmon and morel pieces remaining from the original
    packaging. Multiple violations were identified at the time of inspection, including
    temperature control issues, improper time control and sanitization procedures,
    and improper storage of personal items. On the basis of the thorough environmental
    inspection and collection of food samples, clinical presentation of index patients,
    and early evidence implicating a specific food item, investigators determined
    that environmental sample collection was not necessary. On April 19, restaurant
    A informed GCCHD that it had received four additional telephone calls from patrons
    reporting illness after consumption of the special sushi roll. Other patrons reported
    illness directly to GCCHD throughout the investigation.'

    additional cases, GCCHD continued to receive reports of gastrointestinal illness
    related to eating at restaurant A between March 28 and April 17\. In total, the
    investigation identified 51 cases of illness* (including five cases among employees
    and 46 among restaurant patrons); of these cases, four ill persons visited a hospital
    emergency department, three were hospitalized, and the two index patients died
    (including one who sought emergency care but was not hospitalized). Among the
    51 ill persons, 45 (88%) reported consumption of morels at restaurant A. Review
    of medical records for the three persons who were hospitalized and one person
    who sought emergency medical care without hospitalization revealed that the onset
    of gastrointestinal symptoms was rapid, with a median symptom onset of 1 hour
    after the restaurant meal. Vomiting and diarrhea were reportedly profuse, and
    hospitalized patients had clinical evidence of dehydration. The two patients who
    died had chronic underlying medical conditions that might have affected their
    ability to tolerate massive fluid loss.

    of Public Health contacted 12 California facilities that received morels from
    the same importer during January 1–May 17, 2023, six of which responded to the
    inquiries and reported receiving no illness complaints from patrons who ate morels
    prepared and served by those facilities. All six facilities reported cooking or
    otherwise thoroughly heating the morels before they were served. A CDC Epidemic
    Information Exchange (Epi-X) multistate call for cases did not result in additional
