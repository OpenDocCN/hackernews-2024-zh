    and other developers had already signaled their displeasure with how Apple has
    chosen to [adapt its rules](https://techcrunch.com/2024/01/25/apple-dma-changes/)
    to meet the requirements of the new EU regulation, the Digital Markets Act (DMA),
    calling it “[extortion](https://techcrunch.com/2024/01/26/spotify-calls-apples-dma-compliance-plan-extortion-and-a-complete-and-total-farce/)”
    and [“bad-faith” compliance](https://techcrunch.com/2024/01/17/epic-plans-to-contest-apples-bad-faith-compliance-with-court-ruling-over-app-store/),
    among other things. Now those companies have formalized their complaints [in a
    letter addressed to the European Commission,](https://newsroom.spotify.com/2024-03-01/a-letter-to-the-european-commission-on-apples-lack-of-dma-compliance/)
    where they collectively argue that Apple has made a mockery of the new law and
    urge the EC to take “swift, timely, and decisive action against Apple” in order
    to protect developers.

    have been widely criticized by developers and tech companies, including [Meta](https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/01/mark-zuckerberg-calls-apples-dma-rules-so-onerous-he-doubts-any-developer-will-opt-in/),
    [Mozilla](https://techcrunch.com/2024/01/26/apple-dma-webkit/) and [Microsoft](https://mashable.com/article/meta-microsoft-lobby-eu-apple-app-store-dma).
    Instead of introducing a new, more level playing field where developers could
    easily compete with Apple’s App Store, Apple found a way to legally comply with
    the specifics of the regulation, but not its intention. Most notably, it introduced
    a Core Technology Fee for those developers adopting its DMA rules, which requires
    apps distributed outside the App Store to still pay Apple €0.50 for each first
    annual install per year over a 1 million threshold. This was bad news for would-be
    rivals that had wanted to set up their own app stores or distribute their apps
    outside of Apple’s walls to avoid paying commissions.

    but if left unchanged, make a mockery of the DMA and the considerable efforts
    by the European Commission and EU institutions to make digital markets competitive,”
    it reads.

- en: The letter goes on to point out where the companies think that Apple is non-compliant
    with the DMA, noting that Apple’s system of requiring developers to choose to
    opt into the DMA terms adds unnecessary complexity and confusion, as both are
    non-compliant, it says. Plus, because of the new fee structure, and the Core Technology
    Fee, it’s clear that few will agree to the DMA terms, the companies said. While
    there has been much vocal criticism of the terms, at least one developer, MacPaw,
    recently announced it had accessed the terms to distribute its software subscription
    Setapp in the EU.

    of the risks associated with transacting outside Apple’s App Store, will “mislead
    and degrade the user experience, depriving them of real choice and the benefits
    of the DMA.”

    for alternative app stores and sideloading — the former which the companies say
    Apple makes difficult and the latter which Apple’s DMA rules don’t even allow
    for.

    that outlines its solutions to address the changes the DMA requires to commissions
    and payments. Here, it stresses the security and trust customers have with Apple
    and its emphasis on consumer privacy. In short, its position is that “Users should
    not be exposed to physical harm through iOS,” and that all its efforts with regard
    to DMA compliance are means of reducing any potential harms that users could be
    exposed to.

    [today reversed an earlier decision](https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/01/apple-reverses-decision-about-blocking-web-apps-on-iphones-in-the-eu/)

    [FT had recently reported](https://www.ft.com/content/1e677a7e-9494-4f5b-a724-9e58ef26b34f)
    that the EC’s ruling focused on competition in the streaming music market will
    not be in Apple’s favor and will rather extract a €500 million fine from the iPhone
    maker. Apple responded to this by [sharing details about Spotify’s success on
    iOS](https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/22/as-possible-ec-fine-nears-apple-claims-spotify-is-trying-to-get-limitless-access-to-its-tools-without-paying/),
