    of DNA and RNA that combine to express all of the traits and characteristics that
    make each of us unique. Each gene is given a name and alphanumeric code, known
    as a symbol, which scientists use to coordinate research. But over the past year
    or so, some 27 human genes have been renamed, all because Microsoft Excel kept
    misreading their symbols as dates.'

    symbol into a spreadsheet, like MARCH1 — short for “[Membrane Associated Ring-CH-Type

    have to sort through by hand to restore. It’s also surprisingly widespread and
    affects even peer-reviewed scientific work. One study [from 2016](https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-016-1044-7)
    examined genetic data shared alongside 3,597 published papers and found that roughly

    Institute in the UK, told *The Verge*. Módos, whose job involves analyzing freshly
    sequenced genetic data, says Excel errors happen all the time, simply because
    the software is often the first thing to hand when scientists process numerical
    data. “It’s a widespread tool and if you are a bit computationally illiterate
    you will use it,” he says. “During my PhD studies I did as well!”

    auto-formatting, and the only way to avoid it is to [change the data type](https://go.redirectingat.com/?xs=1&id=1025X1701640&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DSppKiKIdCkI%26feature%3Dyoutu.be) for
    individual columns*.* Even then, a scientist might fix their data but export it
    as a CSV file without saving the formatting. Or, another scientist might load
    the data without the correct formatting, changing gene symbols back into dates.
    The end result is that while knowledgeable Excel users can avoid this problem,
    it’s easy for mistakes to be introduced.

    the names of genes, the HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee, or HGNC. This week,
    the HGNC published new [guidelines](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-020-0669-3)
    for gene naming, including for “symbols that affect data handling and retrieval.”
    From now on, they say, human genes and the proteins they expressed will be named
    with one eye on Excel’s auto-formatting. That means the symbol MARCH1 has now
    become MARCHF1, while SEPT1 has become SEPTIN1, and so on. A record of old symbols
    and names will be stored by HGNC to avoid confusion in the future.

- en: So far, the names of some 27 genes have been changed like this over the past
    year, Elspeth Bruford, the coordinator of HGNC, tells *The Verge,* but the guidelines
    themselves weren’t formally announced until this week. “We consulted the respective
    research communities to discuss the proposed updates, and we also notified researchers
    who had published on these genes specifically when the changes were being put
    into effect,” says Bruford.

    Like the lexicographers charged with updating dictionaries, the Gene Nomenclature
    Committee has to be sensitive to the needs of those individuals who will be most
    affected by their work.

    gene naming was often a [playground for creative scientists](https://psmag.com/environment/sonic-hedgehog-dicer-problem-naming-genes-91386),
    leading to notorious genes like “sonic hedgehog” (yes, named for *that S*onic)
    and “Indy” (short for “I’m not dead yet”; a reference to the gene’s function,
    which can double the life span of fruit flies when mutated).

    don’t cede much ground to whimsy or ego. The focus is on practical concerns: how
    do we minimize confusion? For that reason, gene symbols should be unique, and
    gene names should be brief and specific, says the committee. They cannot use subscript
    or superscript; can only contain Latin letters and Arabic numerals; and should
    not spell out names or words, particularly offensive ones (a rule that should
    hold true “ideally in any language”).'

- en: And while the decision to rename genes is not taken lightly, it’s not unusual,
    says Bruford. Many gene symbols that can be read as nouns have been renamed to
    avoid false positives during searches, for example. In the past, CARS has become
    CARS1, WARS changed to WARS1, and MARS tweaked to MARS1\. Other changes have been
    made to avoid insult.

    child has a mutation in a particular gene,” says Bruford. “For example, HECA used
    to have the gene name ‘headcase homolog (Drosophila),’ named after the equivalent
    gene in fruit fly, but we changed it to ‘hdc homolog, cell cycle regulator’ to
    avoid potential offense.”

    to make a significant change to features that are used extremely widely by the
    rest of the massive community of Excel users.”

    it wouldn’t do to wait on a hypothetical Excel update to fix these problems when
    a long-term solution can be introduced by scientists themselves. Microsoft Excel
    may be fleeting, but human genes will be around for as long as we are. It’s best
    to give them names that work.
