    a 40,000-strong botnet packed with end-of-life routers and IoT devices being used
    in cybercriminal activities.**'

- en: According to new documentation from Lumen’s Black Lotus Labs, a notorious cybercriminal
    group has been running a multi-year campaign targeting end-of-life small home/small
    office (SOHO) routers and IoT devices around the world.

- en: The router botnet, first seen in 2014, has been operating quietly while growing
    to more than 40,000 bots from 88 countries in January and February  of 2024, the
    researchers warned.

    proxy service, known as Faceless. Our latest tracking has shown [the botnet] has
    enabled Faceless’ growth at a rate of nearly 7,000 new users per week.”

- en: The Black Lotus Labs researchers said they identified the logical map of the
    group’s proxy service, including a campaign that began in the first week of March
    2024 that targeted over 6,000 ASUS routers in less than 72 hours.

- en: The researchers noted that the SOHO/IoT based activity cluster was observed
    communicating with tens of thousands of distinct IP addresses per week. “Our analysis
    indicates  that the operators behind this botnet were enrolling the compromised
    end of life (EoL) devices  into an established residential proxy service called
    Faceless,” the [Black Lotus Labs team said](https://blog.lumen.com/the-darkside-of-themoon/),
    warning that it has become “a formidable proxy service that rose from the ashes
    of the “iSocks” anonymity service and has  become an integral tool for cybercriminals
    in obfuscating their activity.”

- en: The researchers believe the targeting of end-of-life IoT devices around the
    globe is deliberate, as they are no longer supported by the manufacturer and known
    security vulnerabilities go unpatched.

    or abandoned,” the researchers warned

    look for attacks on weak credentials and suspicious login attempts, even when
    they originate from residential IP addresses which bypass geofencing and ASN based
    blocking.

    bots that are attempting to perform password spraying attacks and begin blocking
    IoCs with Web Application Firewalls.
