- en: Modern web bloat means some pages load 21MB of data - entry-level phones can't
    run some simple web pages, and some sites are harder to render than PUBG | Tom's

    on the current status of unoptimized web pages and web app performance, finding
    that just loading a web page can even bog down an entry-level device that can
    run the popular game PUBG at 40 fps. In fact, the Wix webpage requires loading
    21MB of data for one page, while the more famous websites Patreon and Threads
    load 13MB of data for one page. This can result in slow load times that reach
    up to 33 seconds or, in some cases, result in the page failing to load at all.

- en: The main measurements are in the table below (expand the tweet to see the table),
    which measures the Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) time across several websites
    and low-spec devices. As LCP's full name implies, this is usually the time between
    a user opening the page and the device rendering its primary content. In addition
    to the time it takes to load, the bandwidth demands of each site are shown in
    the left-hand columns. The testing includes the lowest-end Itel P32, the entry-level
    Tecno S8C, and more powerful systems like the Apple M3 Max, M1 Pro, and M3.

- en: As the testing above shows, some of the most brutally intensive websites include
    the likes of...Quora, and basically every major social media platform. Newer content
    production platforms like Squarespace and newer Forum platforms like Discourse
    also have significantly worse performance than their older counterparts, often
    to the point of unusability on some devices.

- en: The Tecno S8C, one of the prominent entry-level phones common in emerging markets,
    is one particularly compelling test device that stuck. The device is actually
    quite impressive in some ways, including its [ability to run *PlayerUnknown's
    Battlegrounds Mobile* at 40 FPS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McawfNlydqk)—
    but the same device can't even run Quora and experiences nigh-unusable lag when
    scrolling on social media sites.

- en: That example is most likely the best summation of the overall point, which is
    that modern web and app design is increasingly trending toward an unrealistic
    assumption of ever-increasing bandwidth and processing. Quora is a website where
    people *answer questions*— there is absolutely no reason any of these websites
    should be harder to run than a Battle Royale game.

- en: The full piece goes into much more detail on these points and includes several
    citations and quotes from web developers. For example, founder and former CEO
    of Discourse Jeff Atwood was quoted as saying Qualcomm is *"terrible at their
    jobs. I hope they go out of business"*...because Qualcomm CPUs were 15% behind
    Apple's. That feels like an extreme statement about a manufacturer that provides
    the majority of smartphone SoCs available on the market. You can [read the full
    report here](https://danluu.com/slow-device/) for more details about the tests
    and resulting performance measurements.
