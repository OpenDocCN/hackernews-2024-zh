- en: When I make [plotter art](/browse/plotter), I use [P5.JS](https://p5js.org/)
    and the [P5-SVG plugin](https://github.com/zenozeng/p5.js-svg) to render my graphics
    as SVGs. This workflow allows me to download the files as vectors. Then, I can
    upload them to [Saxi](https://github.com/nornagon/saxi), a utility that controls
    my Axidraw pen plotters. The translation between coding art and having the pen
    plotter draw it is nearly seamless.

- en: Rendering a graphic at 60FPS and responding to user input started to become
    slow with this approach, though. I found that updating the DOM with new SVG elements
    60 times a second wasn't ideal. I flipped back to the typical rendering approach
    used by P5.JS, which leverages HTML canvas. It immediately fixed all frame rate
    issues and made the application feel much more fluid when twirling the MIDI controls.

- en: To have the performance of canvas and compatibility of SVGs, I made two instances
    of P5.JS sketches, one with each rendering target. I only rendered the vector
    instance before the application was transmitted to the cloud job manager.

- en: I needed to build an application UI to display helpful hints, an intro screen,
    and some submission steps. To do this, I brought in [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/).
    Although I could have used React here, I like the ease of use that comes with
    Svelte. React felt heavy-handed since I wasn't worried about component reuse or
    application render performance at this layer. Never defeated, though, React managed
    to make its way into the stack later on.
