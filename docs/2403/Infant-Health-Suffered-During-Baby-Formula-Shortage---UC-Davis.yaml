- en: The nationwide baby formula shortage two years ago forced many parents to involuntarily
    switch brands or types. A recent survey from researchers at the University of
    California, Davis, highlights how these substitutions led to undesirable effects
    for babies, including vomiting. The study was published in the journal [Nutrients](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/16/5/748).

    during the May 2022 shortage, 81% of respondents switched formulas, with 87% of
    those switching because they could not find the formula they typically used.

    Smilowitz, assistant professor of Cooperative Extension for the Department of
    Nutrition who is a corresponding author of the study. “Infants have strict nutrient
    requirements; they can only eat two things: human milk and formula.”'

    multiple brands of its powdered formula products in 2022 due to bacterial contamination.
    The move exacerbated existing shortages caused by pandemic-related supply chain
    issues.

    experienced issues such as fussiness, gas, spit-up, constipation and diarrhea.
    Infants who relied on specialty formulas due to a medical or metabolic condition,
    experienced these issues more frequently than babies who had not required specialty
    formulas.

    formulas, that’s something we don’t really talk about,” Smilowitz said.

    during the shortage. They also visited more than four stores in a 24-hour period
    to find baby formula and traveled more than 20 miles in a 24-hour period to purchase
    formula.

    Last year, they published a [paper](https://caes.ucdavis.edu/news/unsafe-feeding-methods-spiked-during-infant-formula-shortage)
    that showed that 48.5% of individuals used at least one unsafe feeding practice
    during the shortage, up from 8% before.

    including social media (51%) and healthcare providers (48%), followed by relatives
    or friends (43%), and lactation consultant or lactation counselor (30%), according
    to the latest survey.

    policies and programs to improve the resiliency of the infant food system and
    hopefully prevent infant-feeding crises in the future. She said informing mothers
    about their options and resources during and immediately after their pregnancies
    would be a step in the right direction.

    a result of a lack of lactation education and support and priority in human milk
    feeding,” she said. “We need to improve infants’ food supply and it starts with
    supporting mothers and babies.”
