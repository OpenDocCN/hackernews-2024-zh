    on the moon.” She had just gotten home from the hospital, where she had been treated
    for optic neuritis and vertigo, and she was trying to relax in the calm water.
    Suddenly, bright colors and shapes began to appear in front of her. Yellow took
    the form of a triangle; orange was shaped like a rectangle. She felt as if she
    could reach out and touch them. Most strongly, she felt a desire to create. “It
    felt like lightning,” de Avila says. “Like something turned on in a second. It
    was a mystery to me.”

    in splotches of teal, brown, and orange. She titled her first piece “Blobs and

    especially for acquired savant syndrome, is that anomaly or damage in the left
    hemisphere essentially rewires the brain, recruiting new capacity or releasing
    dormant ability from the intact right hemisphere—much as a person with a broken
    leg relies more heavily on their opposing, functioning limb, thereby strengthening
    it.
  prefs: []

    but differences do exist: The left hemisphere specializes in logical, sequential,
    language-based processes, while the right specializes in creative and artistic
    processes. Acquired savant syndrome overwhelmingly involves left hemisphere damage
    and right hemisphere specialty skills. Injury, disease, or disability essentially
    “unlocks” the brain, leading a particular region to explode in functioning and
    flourishing. After a violent storm, lush, new vegetation blooms.'

    research finds that for savants, some brain regions are bigger, concentrations
    of neurotransmitters higher, and connectivity stronger in the right hemisphere
    than in the left. “The electrical cabling is more robust,” says Neva Corrigan,
    a research scientist at the University of Washington. This aligns with research
    demonstrating that the right hemisphere uses more energy to generate more activity
    than the left, as measured by glucose and oxygen consumption. In acquired savant
    syndrome, “the left gets impaired, and the right gets freed up,” says Irem Onin
    of Istanbul Medipol University, co-author of a 2023 review article on savant syndrome.

    implicated, and special abilities often appear in relatives of those with savant

    a numerical ability, the ability to accurately guess the number of items in a
