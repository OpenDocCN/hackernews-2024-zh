    on the moon.” She had just gotten home from the hospital, where she had been treated
    for optic neuritis and vertigo, and she was trying to relax in the calm water.
    Suddenly, bright colors and shapes began to appear in front of her. Yellow took
    the form of a triangle; orange was shaped like a rectangle. She felt as if she
    could reach out and touch them. Most strongly, she felt a desire to create. “It
    felt like lightning,” de Avila says. “Like something turned on in a second. It
    was a mystery to me.”

    Avila说。“就像一瞬间被打开了。对我来说是一个谜。”

    a research scientist at the University of Washington. This aligns with research
    demonstrating that the right hemisphere uses more energy to generate more activity
    than the left, as measured by glucose and oxygen consumption. In acquired savant

    He once asked the top speed reader to teach him how to do it. After their training
    session, Logothetis picked up a book—and he read about 1,000 words a minute (research
    suggests the average is about 238 words a minute for fiction and 175–300 for nonfiction).

    an adventure he embarks on every five years. That year, some psychological topics
    were on the docket. This led him to Dr. Treffert. On a call, Treffert explained
    the concept of acquired savant syndrome, sharing stories of people who, following
    an accident, could suddenly draw beautiful pictures or write incredible music.
    It was then that Logothetis learned there were documented cases of individuals
    acquiring skills and talents following neural catastrophe—including a bout of
    meningitis.

    Much of this work has been conducted by Allan Snyder, a professor at the University
