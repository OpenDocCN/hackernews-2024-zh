- en: In order to understand why we can easily support many architectures, let's briefly
    digress on compilers and emulators.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Compiler are usually organized in frontend, mid-end and backend. The frontend
    handles details specific to the input language. The mid-end performs optimizations
    on an intermediate representation (IR) that is independent of both the input language
    and the target architecture. Finally, the backend performs architecture-specific
    optimizations and outputs executable code.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'Let''s consider a part of the LLVM ecosystem:'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: LLVM IR is LLVM's intermediate representation.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'Let''s now consider QEMU, a well-known emulator. When running in emulation
    mode, as opposed to virtualization mode (e.g., KVM), works in a similar fashion.
    It has its own frontends, its own IR (tiny code) and multiple backends. The main
    difference relies in the fact that the input is not C or C++ but ARM or x86-64
    executable code:'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This type of emulation is also known as dynamic binary translation.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'Now, rev.ng works like this:'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Basically we use the first half of the QEMU pipeline to *lift* executable code
    to tiny code, convert it to LLVM IR and then proceed with the decompilation process.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This means we can support any [architecture supported by QEMU](https://wiki.qemu.org/Documentation/Platforms)
    with relative ease.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: However, architecture support is just part of the story. The other big topic
    is how well a certain platform or, more specifically, an ABI, is supported. In
    this regard, we put a lot of effort to be able to describe in a declarative way
    all the properties of an ABI. Our [ABI description format](https://github.com/revng/revng/tree/f297712/share/revng/abi)
    is general enough that supporting new ABIs will be quite easy.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Status as of today**: we support x86, x86-64, ARM, AArch64, MIPS, and s390x
    to various degrees of maturity. In terms of binary formats, we support ELF, PE/COFF
    and Mach-O. We can also import from `.idb`, DWARF debug info and PDB debug info.
    We performed most QA on Linux x86-64 binaries, all the rest needs additional QA.'

    you can exploit many many tool in its ecosystem. For instance, you could use [KLEE](https://klee.github.io/)
    to perform symbolic execution or [SanitizerCoverage](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/SanitizerCoverage.html)
    + [libFuzzer](https://llvm.org/docs/LibFuzzer.html) (or other tools) to perform
    coverage-guided fuzzing. Also, since the output of our decompiler is valid C,
    we've also been able to play around with [clang static analyzer](https://clang-analyzer.llvm.org/)
    to look for common vulnerabilities directly on the decompiled code. But this probably
