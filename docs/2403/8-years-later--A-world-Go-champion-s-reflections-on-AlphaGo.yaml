- en: As a world Go champion, I’d only ever played the game against other humans.
    That changed in 2016 when I played a five-match game of Go against [AlphaGo](https://deepmind.google/technologies/alphago/),
    Google’s AI system. I admit, I underestimated just how powerful AI could be and
    ended up only winning one out of our five games together.

    I didn’t quite grasp how serious of a matter it was. I thought it would be an
    easy victory, and that this was a casual experiment. But once this game became
    public, I realized how big of a deal it was.

- en: And I still remember how amazed I was at how brilliantly AlphaGo played, the
    moves it came up with. Go is a deeply complex strategic game — famously far more
    complicated than chess, with 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000
    possible board configurations. That means AlphaGo has to be creative, not just
    calculative.

    capability for another decade. And this year marks the eight-year anniversary
    of the game I played against AlphaGo. In those eight years, AI has developed at
    an incredible speed. Go players around the world have now used AlphaGo to try
    to uncover new moves, new strategies and new ideas in this ancient game.
