    design aesthetic in consumer apps.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    and can greatly improve the usability of a simple interface. Long live bountiful
    white space!

    ones I mean: technology-enabling control panels, data-intensive logistics systems,
    and number-heavy accounting systems. The tools our business users rely on to get
    their jobs done every day.'

- en: Let me tell you a sad story.
  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'The protagonist is a well-intentioned UX Designer at a large high-tech company
    who was given a new project: Redesign an internal control panel that was ugly,
    hard to learn, and stuffed full of content on every screen (so much data). Everyone
    agreed it needed modernization—it looked like it was from the early 2000s, after
    all!'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So this designer set out to solve the problem, taking cues from modern consumer
    apps.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The new design simplified every screen. It broke apart huge pages into smaller,
    more focused ones. It used progressive disclosure to hide presumably insignificant
    information. And since today’s users don’t mind scrolling (ahem), the design incorporated
    white space in all of the usual places—around headers, content blocks, and in
    table rows. The breathing room was glorious.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It lasted one month before the company was forced to retire it.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Users absolutely hated the new system. Sure, the old system was ugly, but it
    had everything they needed, right at their fingertips! Their jobs were incredibly
    fast paced—they worked in a tech support call center and were rated on productivity
    metrics. They didn’t have time to click or scroll to find information while the
    clock was *literally* ticking.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In their eyes, this new system wasn’t an upgrade, it was a boondoggle. It wasn’t
    just a little frustrating—*it made them mad.*

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A large business by its nature has massive-scale data and usually thousands
    of users who directly interact with it—searching, manipulating, reporting, and
    more. They need to move through that data quickly, without a lot of digging around
    in the interface.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'Think of it this way: Just like you wouldn’t appreciate a dictionary with only
    10 words per page (so many pages to flip through!), enterprise users don’t want
    systems that make them work to find the things they’re looking for.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But that doesn’t mean your interface has to be ugly.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Well-designed data density can present massive amounts of information on every
    screen, while still maintaining a clear and scannable content hierarchy. Done
    right, users can quickly and accurately access the data they need, without impacting
    their ability to read text or interact with the application as a whole.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Following are some recommendations on how to increase data density without decreasing
    the modern aesthetic of your application.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    see if all of that data is even necessary. Ask yourself:'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Can I eliminate redundant data?** So many systems accidentally display the
    same data multiple times with slight variations. (Massive tables are the first
    place to start looking for duplicative information.)'

    know, ask! Are they really using everything that’s available to them?'
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Can I do a better job of grouping related information?** Not every discrete
    data element always needs its own table cell, even if that’s how it’s stored in
    the back-end system. See where you might reduce visual complexity by combining
    elements — for example, by putting a customer’s first and last name in the same
    field.'

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Reduce the color of less-important content wherever possible. Using a conservative
    palette in your design makes the color you *do* use more impactful and open to
    interactive or visual meaning—like in error messages (usually red) or link text.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In the above example, note the prominence of the single red highlight in the
    gray-themed table, thanks to the lack of other color. Each row suffers slightly
    in its horizontal scannability, but at the gain of increased table-wide scannability.
    Consider what is more important for your application.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Sometimes you just can’t be dense enough. When dealing with large data sets,
    long lists, complex tables, or page after page of results, sometimes the best
    solution is to enable users to take that data to another tool where they can interact
    with it differently.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Consider adding affordances for your users to export the data they’re looking
    at (or a superset of it! what if your export could include *more* data than you
    can fit on the screen?) via XML, XLS, JSON, or CSV.

    sizes for touch targets. For example, Material has good [guidelines for the layout

- en: Enterprise designers can take a lot of great cues from consumer design, but
    functionality must always be our primary concern. That’s because our users don’t
    have a choice, they *have* to use the tools we design—if they don’t think a system
    is usable, they can’t decide to just go download a different one. So we owe it
    to them to put their daily productivity first—always.
