    as the Biden administration seeks to use its existing authority to leave people
    with less debt after the Supreme Court struck down its sweeping $400 billion loan
    forgiveness plan last June. The Biden administration has so far cleared the education
    debts of nearly 4 million people, totaling $143.6 billion in relief.
