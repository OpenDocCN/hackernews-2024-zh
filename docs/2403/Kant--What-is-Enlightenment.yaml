    inability to use one's own understanding without another's guidance. This nonage
    is self-imposed if its cause lies not in lack of understanding but in indecision
    and lack of courage to use one's own mind without another's guidance. *Dare to
    know!* (*Sapere aude.*) "Have the courage to use your own understanding," is therefore
    the motto of the enlightenment.

    remain minors all their lives, long after nature has freed them from external
    guidance. They are the reasons why it is so easy for others to set themselves
    up as guardians. It is so comfortable to be a minor. If I have a book that thinks
    for me, a pastor who acts as my conscience, a physician who prescribes my diet,
    and so on--then I have no need to exert myself. I have no need to think, if only
    I can pay; others will take care of that disagreeable business for me. Those guardians
    who have kindly taken supervision upon themselves see to it that the overwhelming
    majority of mankind--among them the entire fair sex--should consider the step
    to maturity, not only as hard, but as extremely dangerous. First, these guardians
    make their domestic cattle stupid and carefully prevent the docile creatures from
    taking a single step without the leading-strings to which they have fastened them.
    Then they show them the danger that would threaten them if they should try to
    walk by themselves. Now this danger is really not very great; after stumbling
    a few times they would, at last, learn to walk. However, examples of such failures
    intimidate and generally discourage all further attempts.

    which has become almost second nature to him. He has even grown to like it, and
    is at first really incapable of using his own understanding because he has never
    been permitted to try it. Dogmas and formulas, these mechanical tools designed
    for reasonable use--or rather abuse--of his natural gifts, are the fetters of
    an everlasting nonage. The man who casts them off would make an uncertain leap
    over the narrowest ditch, because he is not used to such free movement. That is
    why there are only a few men who walk firmly, and who have emerged from nonage
    by cultivating their own minds.

    if it is only given freedom, enlightenment is almost inevitable. There will always
    be a few independent thinkers, even among the self-appointed guardians of the
    multitude. Once such men have thrown off the yoke of nonage, they will spread
    about them the spirit of a reasonable appreciation of man''s value and of his
    duty to think for himself. It is especially to be noted that the public which
    was earlier brought under the yoke by these men afterwards forces these very guardians
    to remain in submission, if it is so incited by some of its guardians who are
    themselves incapable of any enlightenment. That shows how pernicious it is to
    implant prejudices: they will eventually revenge themselves upon their authors
    or their authors'' descendants. Therefore, a public can achieve enlightenment
    only slowly. A revolution may bring about the end of a personal despotism or of
    avaricious tyrannical oppression, but never a true reform of modes of thought.
    New prejudices will serve, in place of the old, as guide lines for the unthinking
    multitude.'

    军官说：“不要争论--训练！” 税务员：“不要争论--缴税！” 牧师：“不要争论--信仰！” 世界上唯一一个统治者却说：“尽管争论，但要服从！” 我们到处都可以发现对自由的限制。但是哪种限制对启蒙有害？哪种限制是无辜的，哪种又促进启蒙？我回答说：公开使用自己理性的权利必须随时自由，只有这样才能给人类带来启蒙。
- en: 'On the other hand, the private use of reason may frequently be narrowly restricted
    without especially hindering the progress of enlightenment. By "public use of
    one''s reason" I mean that use which a man, as *scholar*, makes of it before the
    reading public. I call "private use" that use which a man makes of his reason
    in a civic post that has been entrusted to him. In some affairs affecting the
    interest of the community a certain [governmental] mechanism is necessary in which
    some members of the community remain passive. This creates an artificial unanimity
    which will serve the fulfillment of public objectives, or at least keep these
    objectives from being destroyed. Here arguing is not permitted: one must obey.
    Insofar as a part of this machine considers himself at the same time a member
    of a universal community--a world society of citizens--(let us say that he thinks
    of himself as a scholar rationally addressing his public through his writings)
    he may indeed argue, and the affairs with which he is associated in part as a
    passive member will not suffer. Thus it would be very unfortunate if an officer
    on duty and under orders from his superiors should want to criticize the appropriateness
    or utility of his orders. He must obey. But as a scholar he could not rightfully
    be prevented from taking notice of the mistakes in the military service and from
    submitting his views to his public for its judgment. The citizen cannot refuse
    to pay the taxes levied upon him; indeed, impertinent censure of such taxes could
    be punished as a scandal that might cause general disobedience. Nevertheless,
    this man does not violate the duties of a citizen if, as a scholar, he publicly
    expresses his objections to the impropriety or possible injustice of such levies.
    A pastor, too, is bound to preach to his congregation in accord with the doctrines
    of the church which he serves, for he was ordained on that condition. But as a
    scholar he has full freedom, indeed the obligation, to communicate to his public
    all his carefully examined and constructive thoughts concerning errors in that
    doctrine and his proposals concerning improvement of religious dogma and church
    institutions. This is nothing that could burden his conscience. For what he teaches
    in pursuance of his office as representative of the church, he represents as something
    which he is not free to teach as he sees it. He speaks as one who is employed
    to speak in the name and under the orders of another. He will say: "Our church
    teaches this or that; these are the proofs which it employs." Thus he will benefit
    his congregation as much as possible by presenting doctrines to which he may not
    subscribe with full conviction. He can commit himself to teach them because it
    is not completely impossible that they may contain hidden truth. In any event,
    he has found nothing in the doctrines that contradicts the heart of religion.
    For if he believed that such contradictions existed he would not be able to administer
    his office with a clear conscience. He would have to resign it. Therefore the
    use which a scholar makes of his reason before the congregation that employs him
    is only a private use, for no matter how sizable, this is only a domestic audience.
    In view of this he, as preacher, is not free and ought not to be free, since he
    is carrying out the orders of others. On the other hand, as the scholar who speaks
    to his own public (the world) through his writings, the minister in the public
    use of his reason enjoys unlimited freedom to use his own reason and to speak
    for himself. That the spiritual guardians of the people should themselves be treated
    as minors is an absurdity which would result in perpetuating absurdities.'

  zh: 另一方面，私人理性的使用经常受到严格的限制，但并不会特别阻碍启蒙运动的进展。所谓“公共理性的使用”，我指的是一个人作为*学者*，在阅读公众面前使用它。我称之为“私人使用”，是指一个人在被委托的公职中使用自己的理性。在一些影响社区利益的事务中，需要某种[政府的]机制，其中部分社区成员保持被动。这种情况下产生了一种人为的一致性，这将有助于实现公共目标，或者至少防止这些目标被破坏。在这里，不允许辩论：必须服从。在这个机器的一部分同时视自己为一个普遍社区的成员——一个世界公民社会——（让我们说他把自己看作是一个通过他的著作理性地向公众发表言论的学者），他确实可以辩论，他参与的事务作为被动成员的部分将不会受到影响。因此，如果一位值班官员在接到上级命令后想批评其命令的恰当性或实用性，那将是非常不幸的。他必须服从。但作为学者，他不应该被阻止注意到军事服务中的错误，并将他的看法提交给公众以供其判断。公民不能拒绝向他征收的税收；事实上，对这些税收的无礼批评可能会被视为一种可能引起普遍不服从的丑闻而受到惩罚。然而，如果一个人作为学者公开表达对这些征收税款的不当性或可能的不公正的反对意见，他并不违反公民的义务。一位牧师也应当按照他所服务教会的教义向他的会众宣讲，因为他是在这种条件下被任命的。但作为学者，他有充分的自由，甚至有义务，向公众传达他对该教义中错误的仔细检查和建设性想法的所有看法，以及对宗教教义和教会制度改进的建议。这并不会使他的良心感到负担。因为他在作为教会代表的职责下教导的内容，他表达的是他不自由地教导的东西。他说：“我们的教会教导这个或那个；这是它所使用的证据。”因此，他将尽可能地通过呈现他可能不完全认同的教义来使他的会众受益。他可以承诺教导它们，因为这些教义可能包含隐藏的真理并非完全不可能。无论如何，他在这些教义中没有发现与宗教核心相矛盾的东西。因为如果他相信存在这样的矛盾，他将无法以清白的良心履行他的职责。他将不得不辞职。因此，学者在他为雇主的会众使用他的理性时只是私人使用，无论多么重要，这只是一个国内听众。考虑到这一点，作为传道者，他不是自由的，也不应该是自由的，因为他正在执行他人的命令。另一方面，作为学者，他通过他的著作对自己的公众（世界）说话时，他的理性的公共使用享有无限的自由，可以为自己说话。使人民的精神导师自己被视为未成年人是一种荒谬的做法，这会导致荒谬的延续。
- en: 'But should a society of ministers, say a Church Council, . . . have the right
    to commit itself by oath to a certain unalterable doctrine, in order to secure
    perpetual guardianship over all its members and through them over the people?
    I say that this is quite impossible. Such a contract, concluded to keep all further
    enlightenment from humanity, is simply null and void even if it should be confirmed
    by the sovereign power, by parliaments, and the most solemn treaties. An epoch
    cannot conclude a pact that will commit succeeding ages, prevent them from increasing
    their significant insights, purging themselves of errors, and generally progressing
    in enlightenment. That would be a crime against human nature whose proper destiny
    lies precisely in such progress. Therefore, succeeding ages are fully entitled
    to repudiate such decisions as unauthorized and outrageous. The touchstone of
    all those decisions that may be made into law for a people lies in this question:
    Could a people impose such a law upon itself? Now it might be possible to introduce
    a certain order for a definite short period of time in expectation of better order.
    But, while this provisional order continues, each citizen (above all, each pastor
    acting as a scholar) should be left free to publish his criticisms of the faults
    of existing institutions. This should continue until public understanding of these
    matters has gone so far that, by uniting the voices of many (although not necessarily
    all) scholars, reform proposals could be brought before the sovereign to protect
    those congregations which had decided according to their best lights upon an altered
    religious order, without, however, hindering those who want to remain true to
    the old institutions. But to agree to a perpetual religious constitution which
    is not publicly questioned by anyone would be, as it were, to annihilate a period
    of time in the progress of man''s improvement. This must be absolutely forbidden.'

    Nature, then, has carefully cultivated the seed within the hard core--namely the
    urge for and the vocation of free thought. And this free thought gradually reacts
    back on the modes of thought of the people, and men become more and more capable
