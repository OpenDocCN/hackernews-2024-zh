    Babylon, where a married king falls in love with a young, beautiful and wise woman,
    Zabiba. It is a polemical allegory in which Zabiba is Iraq and the king is Saddam,
    who learns from his lover how to be a better monarch. It was published anonymously
    but every Iraqi knew who the writer was. It was distributed liberally by the presidential
    palace, turned into a musical by the national theatre and adapted for a multi-part
    television series.

    author, in part because there was virtually no contact between the US and Iraq.
    Baghdad, once a valuable ally against Iran, had become untouchable after Saddam’s
    1990 invasion of Kuwait sparked the first Gulf war, and after a supposed Iraqi
    plot to kill the elder George Bush on a post-presidential visit to Kuwait three
    years later.

    because the alternative that it really was a serious assassination attempt is
    just hard to derive from the available evidence,” he said. The would-be plotters

    as “the most incompetent hapless assassins you could imagine”.

    contact was taboo. In 1996, Bill Clinton complained to Tony Blair that he could
    not pick up the phone and call the “sonofabitch” in Baghdad.
