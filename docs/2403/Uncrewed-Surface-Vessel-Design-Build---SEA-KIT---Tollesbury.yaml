- en: SEA-KIT's remotely-controlled Uncrewed Surface Vessels (USVs) are designed with
    an adaptable payload area for multiple mission configurations. These vessels can
    work standalone or as part of a fleet to complete a wide range of tasks faster,
    cheaper and with less risk to personnel and significantly reduced carbon emissions
    than traditional, crewed vessels.
