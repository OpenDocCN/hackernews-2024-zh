    bill, currently provides 23+ million low-income Americans a $30 broadband discount
    every month. While it didn’t get much hype, that’s a big deal in a country where

    crush competition underfoot, rubber stamping anti-competitive mergers and consolidation,
    and opposing all broadband consumer protections. The argument is this creates
    some sort of innovative Utopia; the reality is it results in market failure, regulatory
    capture, patchy coverage, high prices, and slow speeds.

    to low-income users struggling to afford access. Throwing money at big telecoms

    Press outlets won’t cover it because the subject doesn’t get enough ad engagement.

    gives the GOP policy credibility the party doesn’t actually deserve.
