- en: The New York Stock Exchange said Monday it will immediately suspend trading
    shares of EV startup Fisker and is moving to take the company off its stock exchange.

- en: The exchange said Monday that Fisker’s stock is “no longer suitable for listing”
    because of “abnormally low” price levels. The decision comes a month after Fisker
    was warned by the NYSE that its stock price had spent 30 days trading below $1,
    putting it out of compliance with the exchange’s rules.

    [filing](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1720990/000172099024000032/fsr-20240325.htm)
    that it expects its stock to be moved to an over-the-counter market such as OTC
    Pink. It also said the delisting has triggered repayment clauses in two outstanding
    loans that it cannot currently afford, which could have a “material adverse effect”
    on the business.

    than 28% before trading was halted. Earlier Monday, Fisker announced it [lost
    a potential deal with a large automaker](https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/25/fisker-nissan-deal-dead-funding-bankruptcy/),
    reported to be Nissan — a development that has also endangered a recently announced
    attempt at securing emergency funding.

    was a critical closing condition for a potential $150 million convertible note
    announced last week. Fisker said in the filing that it will ask the unnamed investor
    to waive the closing condition.

- en: Fisker’s problems, which include complaints from customers, lawsuits and federal
    investigations, have been escalating for months. The imperiled EV startup has
    struggled to sell its Ocean SUV in the early going, underperforming its own internal
    sales goals, as TechCrunch reported in January. It pivoted away from a direct
    sales model and turned to dealerships to help drive sales. It has also [struggled
    with quality problems](https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/09/fisker-ocean-braking-power-loss-problems-investigation/)
    — ones that Fisker has, at times, struggled to solve, according to internal documents.

    (around 200 people) and last week reported having just $121 million in the bank.
    The company has paused production and warned investors it would not survive a
    year without a fresh infusion of cash.
