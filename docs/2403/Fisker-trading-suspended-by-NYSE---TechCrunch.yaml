  zh: 纽约证交所周一表示，将立即暂停电动车初创公司Fisker的股票交易，并计划将该公司从其股票交易所上移除。
- en: The exchange said Monday that Fisker’s stock is “no longer suitable for listing”
    because of “abnormally low” price levels. The decision comes a month after Fisker
    was warned by the NYSE that its stock price had spent 30 days trading below $1,
    putting it out of compliance with the exchange’s rules.

    that it expects its stock to be moved to an over-the-counter market such as OTC
    Pink. It also said the delisting has triggered repayment clauses in two outstanding
    loans that it cannot currently afford, which could have a “material adverse effect”
    on the business.

  zh: Fisker可以审查纽约证券交易所的决定，但在周一下午的[提交文件](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1720990/000172099024000032/fsr-20240325.htm)中表示，预计其股票将被移至场外市场，如OTC
    Pink。公司还表示，退市已触发了两笔未偿还贷款的还款条款，目前无力偿还，这可能对业务造成“重大不利影响”。

    investigations, have been escalating for months. The imperiled EV startup has
    struggled to sell its Ocean SUV in the early going, underperforming its own internal
    sales goals, as TechCrunch reported in January. It pivoted away from a direct
    sales model and turned to dealerships to help drive sales. It has also [struggled
