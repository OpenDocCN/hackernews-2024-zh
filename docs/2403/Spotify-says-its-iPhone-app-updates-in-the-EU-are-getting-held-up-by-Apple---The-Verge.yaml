    in the European Union over years-old complaints from Spotify about its App Store
    rules, Spotify says Apple is stonewalling updates issued in compliance with that
    very ruling. In an email to the European Commission obtained by *The Verge*, Spotify
    writes that Apple has “neither acknowledged nor responded to Spotify’s submission”
    to bring subscription pricing information into the app, preventing it from updating
    the app at all for its users, even to put out fixes for bugs or add other features.

    to Apple that puts links to Spotify’s website, along with pricing information
    for different subscription options, directly in the EU version of its app, without
    using Apple’s payment system. Spotify made the change in response to a ruling
    issued the day before [by the European Commission](/2024/3/4/24005938/european-commission-antitrust-apple-investigation-anti-steering-rules-app-developers),
    which said Apple’s anti-steering rules are “illegal” and ordered Apple to start
    allowing developers to include information about “alternative and cheaper music
    subscription services.”

- en: The company writes that this is “yet another example of how Apple if unchecked,
    will seek to circumvent and/or not comply with the Commission’s decision.” It
    also urges the European Commission to contact Apple and requires that it approve
    Spotify’s changes. “Given Apple’s track record, Spotify is concerned that Apple’s
    delay is intentional and is aimed at delaying or avoiding compliance altogether,”
    the email reads.

    app submission to show EU consumers pricing and a link to our website, which we
    are now authorized to do by the European Commission’s decision on the music streaming
    case,” Spotify spokesperson Jeanne Moran says in an emailed statement to *The
    Verge*. “Apple’s delay directly conflicts with its claim that they turn around
    reviews on app submissions within 24 hours, and it also flies in the face of the
    timeline for adoption the Commission laid out.”

    (DMA) regulations for big tech platforms that have only been around for about
    a week, but the European Commission has already intervened in response to one
    of Apple’s DMA-related decisions. Earlier this month, [Apple revoked Epic Games’
    developer license](/2024/3/6/24092158/epic-apple-developer-account-terminated-digital-markets-act-alternative-ios-app-store)
    because of criticism CEO Tim Sweeney made about Apple’s DMA compliance plan. Epic
    Games [got its developer license back days later](/2024/3/8/24094543/epic-games-ios-developer-license-apple-dma),
    citing “a swift inquiry” from the European Commission.
