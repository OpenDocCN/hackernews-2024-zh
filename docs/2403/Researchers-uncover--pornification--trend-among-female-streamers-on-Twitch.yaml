    researchers investigated sexualized content on Twitch.tv, a livestreaming giant
    with a global daily viewership of 3 million. Their analysis of approximately 2,000
    livestreams reveals a concerning trend: women are more frequently and intensely
    self-sexualizing than men, hinting at a broader pattern of ‘pornification’ in
    digital content to lure audiences.'

- en: Studies on traditional media (such as TV and movies) have extensively documented
    the sexualization of women and its consequences. However, the interactive and
    user-driven nature of new digital platforms like Twitch.tv presents new dynamics
    that warrant exploration, especially as they become integral to daily entertainment
    and social interaction.

- en: Unlike traditional media, where portrayals of women are often controlled by
    external entities, platforms like Twitch.tv allow individuals to curate their
    own online personas. This autonomy raises questions about the factors driving
    self-sexualization, including societal pressures, the pursuit of popularity, and
    the platform’s economic incentives.

    like Twitch.tv and the public concern regarding the sexualized culture that may
    arise in these environments. We wanted to explore how this culture specifically
    manifests based on the gender of the streamers,” said study author [Kristel Anciones-Anguita](https://www.uah.es/es/estudios/profesor/Kristel-Anciones-Anguita/),

    in deeply masculinized environments such as live streaming platforms. We examined
    how some streamers resort to the pornification of their content to attract audiences
    and the potential implications for the perception and behavior of users, especially
    teenagers who have yet to internalize their beliefs about sexuality.”

- en: To begin, the researchers collected a sample of 1,920 video clips from Twitch.tv.
    These clips were selected based on their popularity within the most frequented
    categories of the platform. The sampling process was carried out from September
    to October 2022, focusing on the top videos within the videogame and “In Real
    Life” (IRL) categories, which were further broken down into subcategories like
    “JustChatting,” “ASMR,” and “Pools, Hot Tubs & Beaches.” This cross-sectional
    sampling aimed to capture the diversity of content and streaming practices on
    the platform.

  zh: 研究开始时，研究人员从Twitch.tv采集了1920个视频片段的样本。这些片段是基于平台上最频繁访问的类别中的热门内容进行选择的。采样过程从2022年9月到10月进行，重点关注视频游戏和“真实生活”（IRL）类别中的顶级视频，进一步细分为诸如“JustChatting”、“ASMR”和“Pools,
    Hot Tubs & Beaches”等子类别。这种横断面采样旨在捕捉平台上内容和直播实践的多样性。
- en: The researchers excluded videos where the streamer’s image wasn’t shown and
    those featuring non-real images such as cartoons or 3D human representations.
    Each livestream was then evaluated based on a combination of factors such as clothing,
    exposed body parts, the focus of the image, posture, and behaviors that implied
    sexualization.

- en: The results showed a clear gender disparity in self-sexualization. While the
    platform boasted a larger number of male streamers overall, female streamers were
    found to engage in self-sexualization to a much greater extent and intensity.
    Only two male streamers out of the entire sample were categorized as “hypersexual,”
    compared to 389 female streamers. Similarly, only 5 male streamers out of the
    entire sample were categorized as “sexual,” compared to 190 female streamers.

  zh: 结果显示了自我性感化存在明显的性别差异。虽然平台上男性主播的数量更多，但发现女性主播在自我性感化方面的参与程度和强度更高。在整个样本中，只有两名男性主播被分类为“超性感”，而有389名女性主播被分类为“超性感”。类似地，只有5名男性主播被分类为“性感”，而有190名女性主播被分类为“性感”。
- en: Female streamers were more likely to wear revealing clothing, focus the camera
    on their entire bodies, and exhibit behaviors or postures considered seductive
    or explicitly sexual. These findings underscore a notable difference in content
    presentation, with female streamers often leveraging their physical appearance
    and sexuality to attract viewership. In contrast, male streamers typically focused
    their streams on gaming prowess, conversations, or other non-sexualized content,
    seldom employing their physical appearance as a primary means of engagement.

  zh: 女性主播更倾向于穿着暴露的衣物，将摄像头对准全身，并展示被认为具有诱惑力或明确性的行为或姿势。这些发现强调了内容呈现方式上的显著差异，女性主播通常利用自己的外貌和性感来吸引观众。相比之下，男性主播通常将直播重点放在游戏技能、对话或其他非性化内容上，很少以自己的外貌作为主要吸引观众的手段。
- en: “We were surprised by the significant difference in the levels of content sexualization
    based on the gender of the streamers,” Anciones-Anguita told PsyPost. “While men
    focus their content on talking or playing video games, it was found that the majority
    of streamers who used less clothing, simulated sexual acts, or displayed suggestive
    poses were women.”

  zh: “我们对基于主播性别的内容性感化水平存在显著差异感到惊讶，”Anciones-Anguita告诉PsyPost。“男性聚焦于谈话或玩视频游戏，而发现大多数少穿衣服、模拟性行为或展示暗示性姿势的主播是女性。”
- en: The research also shed light on category-specific trends, revealing that self-sexualization
    was not uniformly distributed across Twitch.tv. Categories traditionally associated
    with gaming showed a lower prevalence of sexualized content among female streamers.
    In contrast, categories like ASMR and “Pools, Hot Tubs & Beaches” not only had
    a higher representation of women but also exhibited much higher levels of sexualization.

  zh: 研究还揭示了类别特定趋势，显示自我性感并不在Twitch.tv上均匀分布。传统上与游戏相关的类别中，女性主播的性感内容较少。相比之下，ASMR和“泳池、热水浴和海滩”等类别不仅女性代表较多，还展示出更高水平的性感化程度。
- en: The study’s findings raise important concerns regarding the pressures and incentives
    that drive self-sexualization on digital platforms like Twitch.tv. These patterns
    of self-sexualization also have potential implications for the shaping of audience
    attitudes towards gender and sexuality.

- en: “The intersection of self-objectification with issues such as sexual exploitation
    and human trafficking underscores the urgent need for platforms and policymakers
    to address these complex challenges,” Anciones-Anguita said. “Especially because,
    despite references to the concept of sexual freedom, self-sexualization often
    responds to a patriarchal idea created based on the male ideology.”

- en: While this study sheds light on significant trends, it also has limitations,
    such as its focus on specific Twitch.tv categories. Future research could utilize
    a longitudinal design to examine trends over time, explore less popular streamers,
    or incorporate mixed methods to capture a fuller spectrum of the Twitch.tv experience
    and its impacts on both streamers and viewers.
