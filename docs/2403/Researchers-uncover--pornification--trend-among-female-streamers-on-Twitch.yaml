    researchers investigated sexualized content on Twitch.tv, a livestreaming giant
    with a global daily viewership of 3 million. Their analysis of approximately 2,000
    livestreams reveals a concerning trend: women are more frequently and intensely
    self-sexualizing than men, hinting at a broader pattern of ‘pornification’ in
    digital content to lure audiences.'

- en: Studies on traditional media (such as TV and movies) have extensively documented
    the sexualization of women and its consequences. However, the interactive and
    user-driven nature of new digital platforms like Twitch.tv presents new dynamics
    that warrant exploration, especially as they become integral to daily entertainment
    and social interaction.

- en: Unlike traditional media, where portrayals of women are often controlled by
    external entities, platforms like Twitch.tv allow individuals to curate their
    own online personas. This autonomy raises questions about the factors driving
    self-sexualization, including societal pressures, the pursuit of popularity, and
    the platform’s economic incentives.

    like Twitch.tv and the public concern regarding the sexualized culture that may
    arise in these environments. We wanted to explore how this culture specifically
    manifests based on the gender of the streamers,” said study author [Kristel Anciones-Anguita](https://www.uah.es/es/estudios/profesor/Kristel-Anciones-Anguita/),

    in deeply masculinized environments such as live streaming platforms. We examined
    how some streamers resort to the pornification of their content to attract audiences
    and the potential implications for the perception and behavior of users, especially
    teenagers who have yet to internalize their beliefs about sexuality.”

    These clips were selected based on their popularity within the most frequented
    categories of the platform. The sampling process was carried out from September
    to October 2022, focusing on the top videos within the videogame and “In Real
    Life” (IRL) categories, which were further broken down into subcategories like
    “JustChatting,” “ASMR,” and “Pools, Hot Tubs & Beaches.” This cross-sectional
    sampling aimed to capture the diversity of content and streaming practices on
    the platform.

    those featuring non-real images such as cartoons or 3D human representations.
    Each livestream was then evaluated based on a combination of factors such as clothing,
    exposed body parts, the focus of the image, posture, and behaviors that implied
    sexualization.

- en: The results showed a clear gender disparity in self-sexualization. While the
    platform boasted a larger number of male streamers overall, female streamers were
    found to engage in self-sexualization to a much greater extent and intensity.
    Only two male streamers out of the entire sample were categorized as “hypersexual,”
    compared to 389 female streamers. Similarly, only 5 male streamers out of the
    entire sample were categorized as “sexual,” compared to 190 female streamers.

- en: Female streamers were more likely to wear revealing clothing, focus the camera
    on their entire bodies, and exhibit behaviors or postures considered seductive
    or explicitly sexual. These findings underscore a notable difference in content
    presentation, with female streamers often leveraging their physical appearance
    and sexuality to attract viewership. In contrast, male streamers typically focused
    their streams on gaming prowess, conversations, or other non-sexualized content,
    seldom employing their physical appearance as a primary means of engagement.

    based on the gender of the streamers,” Anciones-Anguita told PsyPost. “While men
    focus their content on talking or playing video games, it was found that the majority
    of streamers who used less clothing, simulated sexual acts, or displayed suggestive
    poses were women.”

    was not uniformly distributed across Twitch.tv. Categories traditionally associated
    with gaming showed a lower prevalence of sexualized content among female streamers.
    In contrast, categories like ASMR and “Pools, Hot Tubs & Beaches” not only had
    a higher representation of women but also exhibited much higher levels of sexualization.

    attitudes towards gender and sexuality.

- en: “The intersection of self-objectification with issues such as sexual exploitation
    and human trafficking underscores the urgent need for platforms and policymakers
    to address these complex challenges,” Anciones-Anguita said. “Especially because,
    despite references to the concept of sexual freedom, self-sexualization often
    responds to a patriarchal idea created based on the male ideology.”

- en: While this study sheds light on significant trends, it also has limitations,
    such as its focus on specific Twitch.tv categories. Future research could utilize
    a longitudinal design to examine trends over time, explore less popular streamers,
    or incorporate mixed methods to capture a fuller spectrum of the Twitch.tv experience
    and its impacts on both streamers and viewers.
