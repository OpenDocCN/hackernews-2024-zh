    licensing terms](https://www.runtime.news/open-source-was-a-zirp-marketing-funnel/)
    behind a popular open-source project that powered its growth, several developers
    quickly announced plans to create a fork that would live on as a permissively
    licensed project. This week, that group received a big vote of confidence from
    some deep-pocketed backers.

    alternative to the Redis in-memory, NoSQL data store," [it said in a press release](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/press/linux-foundation-launches-open-source-valkey-community?ref=runtime.news).
    Led by Madelyn Olson of AWS, Valkey (["like a Valkyrie"](https://github.com/valkey-io/valkey?ref=runtime.news))
    will keep the BSD 3-clause license that Redis (the company) plans to drop in favor
    of source-available licenses as it releases new versions of Redis (the project).

    AI boom, but this week it jumped directly into the fray. On Wednesday [it released
    DBRX](https://www.databricks.com/blog/announcing-dbrx-new-standard-efficient-open-source-customizable-llms?ref=runtime.news),
    an open large-language model that compares favorably with other open models like
    Meta's Llama as well as older closed models like OpenAI's GPT-3.5.

    billion, and [that team was very careful to describe DBRX as an "open model,](https://www.databricks.com/blog/introducing-dbrx-new-state-art-open-llm?ref=runtime.news)"
    given that [Databricks will require companies with more than 700 million monthly
    users](https://github.com/databricks/dbrx/blob/main/LICENSE?ref=runtime.news)
    to purchase a license to use DBRX and prohibit anyone from using it to improve
    LLMs that compete with DBRX. However, [Databricks' corporate blog](https://www.databricks.com/blog/announcing-dbrx-new-standard-efficient-open-source-customizable-llms?ref=runtime.news),
    [Wired's](https://www.wired.com/story/dbrx-inside-the-creation-of-the-worlds-most-powerful-open-source-ai-model/?ref=runtime.news)
