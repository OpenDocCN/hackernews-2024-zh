    Web, iOS, Android, and Google Meet devices. Your Jam data will be available for
    you to export or migrate to one of our whiteboard partners, like FigJam, Lucidspark,

- en: Over the past couple of years, we’ve heard from customers that whiteboarding
    tools like FigJam by Figma, Lucidspark by Lucid, and Miro help them work better
    together. As these tools have grown more capable, offering advanced features such
    as an infinite canvas, use case templates, voting, and more, we’ve decided to
    leverage our partner ecosystem for whiteboarding in Workspace. Our focus is on
    core content collaboration across Docs, Sheets, and Slides.To that end, in late
    2024 we will wind down the Jamboard whiteboarding app and continue with the [previously
    planned end of support for Google Jamboard devices](/a/answer/7374455).

    for existing Jams so you don't lose your old work. Jamboard users can immediately
    start taking advantage of the new whiteboard technology on mobile, the web, within
    Google Meet, and on Series One devices. In addition to deep integration with Google
    Meet, users can also expect to see these whiteboard tools further incorporated
    into Google Workspace apps, including Drive, Calendar, and Docs.
