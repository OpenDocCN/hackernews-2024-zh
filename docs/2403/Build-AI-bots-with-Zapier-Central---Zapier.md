# Build AI bots with Zapier Central | Zapier

> 来源：[https://zapier.com/central](https://zapier.com/central)

Central bots can only take actions in the apps you’ve connected and use the triggers and actions you’ve set up. When configuring a behavior trigger or action field in Central, you can have the bot always use the same value, pick from a specific set of values, have it guess the value, or not set any value. To provide additional control, you can add more details to your behavior instructions. For example, if you want your bot to always send a direct message to you in Slack, select yourself in the "To username" field but leave the "Message" field "Have AI generate a value for this field" so your bot can send a custom message every time.
