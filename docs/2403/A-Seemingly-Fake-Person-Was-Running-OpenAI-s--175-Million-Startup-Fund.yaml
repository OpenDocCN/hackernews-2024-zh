- en: One document, filed in April 2023, listed Jacob Thomas Vespers and Vespers Inc.
    — a company formed the same day — as the fund's manager. A document filed a few
    weeks later registered the company's address as unit 234, a small second-story
    apartment overlooking the courtyard at The Orchard.

    for OpenAI, said. When asked how this individual came to be listed as in control
    of the company''s Startup Fund, Dutt said that the documents filed with the California
    Secretary of State were faked.'

- en: '"The document itself is not legitimate," Dutt told Business Insider. "It''s
    completely fabricated." Dutt declined to elaborate on how exactly fabricated documents
    came to be filed with the state of California, he would only say repeatedly that
    the documents were "illegitimate."'

    filed the document, and it wasn't aware of the filing until July of 2023 when
    a journalist asked about it.

    of State in August 2023, which doesn't list anyone as the manager of the OpenAI
    Startup Fund. This is the document the public should rely on as the official status
    of this fund, the spokesperson said.

    a public office in the state is a felony. When the journalist informed OpenAI
    about the Vespers document in July 2023, the company did not report the filing
    it says was fabricated to any authorities, Wood said.

    Vespers, referred to in some documents as "Jacob Thomas Redmond Messer," "Jacob
    Thomas Redmond," or "Jacob Thomas Messer."'
