    recalls John Burton, a senior creative lead at Merlin Entertainments (the owner
    of UK-based theme parks including Alton Towers, Chessington World of Adventures,
    and Legoland Windsor) and the man designing the forthcoming 236ft (72-metre) drop
    Hyperia rollercoaster at Thorpe Park. “I would then go to sleep dreaming I could
    become the next Walt Disney.”

    a teenager on a sugar high. “I learned so much about how rollercoaster systems
    work with their block zones, or even the little tricks of the trade at theme parks
    like adding side queues and strategically placed toilets,” he continues, confirming
    my suspicion that the Jumanji-themed jungle world he helped to design for Chessington
    has what he calls “subconscious similarities” to the classic PC game’s Jolly Jungle
    scenario. “If I have to travel to a theme park abroad for work, I still load up
    the original game on the plane and sketch out ideas. I never really stopped playing.”

- en: Released 25 years ago today, RollerCoaster Tycoon (the biggest selling PC game
    of 1999) achieved viral success before online virality was an established thing,
    inspiring countless geo-site forum communities where users could share designs
    and re-creations of their favourite real-life rides. These communities persist
    even today, with one designer recently creating a nightmarish existential rollercoaster
    that takes a sickening 12 years [to complete](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CFVm5R_dxoo).

    RollerCoaster Tycoon helped keep its publisher Atari alive and kicking. Today
    is its 25th anniversary. RollerCoaster Tycoon didn’t just give millions of fans
    an infinite toolbox of fun to build the theme parks of their candified dreams
    (more on this later), but helped to demystify the whole adjacent theme park industry,
    and make it less male dominated.

    projects,” says Candy Holland, executive creative director at Legoland resorts
    and an industry stalwart who helped design the world’s first vertical drop rollercoaster,
    Oblivion, at Alton Towers. “But when RollerCoaster Tycoon came out, we suddenly
    had a surge of young women applying for jobs. They were utilising RollerCoaster
    Tycoon to build their understanding of what, I guess, was previously seen as a
    pretty niche industry.”

    “magic making” team in California. Unlike so many of the games from its era (Resident
    Evil, GoldenEye 007), she argues that RollerCoaster Tycoon traded death and destruction
    fantasies for joyous creativity, and therefore attracted male and female players.
    “Playing RollerCoaster Tycoon was radical,” she says.

    a lot of time making queues that were more like mazes, which hilariously confused
    the customers, and I would show my parents all the designs, too. As a project
    manager I must consider the push and pull of a budget; the effect of increased
    visitation; safety; managing guest flow, and delivering magic. Sometimes when
    I’m in meetings, considering all these things, I remember how RollerCoaster Tycoon
    led me down this path.”

    Heights, each of the game’s 21 scenarios was about finding quick solutions to
    dilemmas and creating a theme park capable of giving pixelated punters the times
    of their lives. “The game’s success really kept the Atari business going,” admits
    Atari’s CEO, Wade Rosen. “I think the fact that you could build these really intricate
    rollercoasters, or completely ignore all of that and launch [customers] into a
    lake or see how many of them you could nauseate, was really the genius of it”

    the canvas of creativity present in RollerCoaster Tycoon was practically a prototype
    for Minecraft later on. He was a ruthlessly capitalistic player, he says. “I really
    liked the business aspects of it … When it was raining, I’d quickly put up the
    prices on umbrellas. I’d be like, now it’s $20\. And then you’d bring in a bunch
    of cash.”

    for a successful franchise – despite the fact that, at the time, its 2D isometric
    graphics stood out like a sore thumb among the fast-improving 3D graphics that
    characterised 1999’s big hitters. “The graphical style is now seen as whimsical
    and unique instead of outdated and restrictive, like it was back then,” the game’s
    Scottish creator, Chris Sawyer, says. “And, perhaps because the focus was much
    less on graphical detail and immersiveness, it was possible to put more depth
    and detail into the actual gameplay.

    or mechanical machines, but always with that freedom to do things your own way
    and to try things out to see what works. RollerCoaster Tycoon’s roots possibly
    come from that – a desire to have something simulated on the computer where you
    could build your own designs from scratch and try things out, and generally just
    learn what works and what doesn’t, and what’s fun or not fun to ride.”

    Tycoon, Sawyer began researching RollerCoaster Tycoon around 1996\. Ironically,
    he grew up terrified of rollercoasters after becoming convinced his cart on The
    Scenic wooden ride in Great Yarmouth would derail during a childhood visit. At
    first, he thought a theme park game might be “too niche”, but after finally falling
    in love with thrill-seeking rides as an adult, he knew he had landed on a special
    idea. He started touring the world’s greatest theme parks and taking notes.

    instincts – we all like to build or create something of our own and then look
    after it, improve it, make sure it looks good and works well and grows well, and
    that’s the crux of this game,” he says. “The other aspect of the game which perhaps
    stands out is that it still remains one of very few games which is almost completely
    positive – you’re rewarded for good design and management rather than destroying
    things, and fundamentally the game is all about keeping your little guests happy.”

    on the world when he visited a theme park in the US in the early 2000s. “I remember
    seeing a whole series of food stalls in a small theme park which looked just like
    RollerCoaster Tycoonfood stalls, with giant items of food or drink modelled on
    top – that felt quite eerie.” When I tell about the real-life rollercoaster designers
    I spoke to for this feature, he seems a little surprised. “I would feel quite
    proud if my games had actually steered some of them towards their careers,” he
    replies.

    they are both keen to highlight that the game doesn’t get everything right about
    theme-park design. “Real life rollercoasters aren’t set in a grid; you can be
    way more flexible,” says Burton. “In the game it costs £50 to place a piece of
    track down. I wish it was £50, as I could build the longest rollercoaster in the
    world. The reality is these are million-pound investments. The speed of the rollercoasters
    aren’t possible in real life either – the G-forces would kill a real person.”

    she made in the game as a child, she’d probably be sacked. “The greatest rides
    are the ones that tell a story,” she says. “The reality is there are hundreds
    of people from different departments putting rollercoasters together.”

    the series will soon expand with a new 3D entry, but the game’s original creator,
    Sawyer, says he has no interest remaking the original two games with next-gen
    graphics. Whatever the future holds for the series, Burton of Merlin is just happy
    it was RollerCoaster Tycoon he got drawn into in 1999, rather than the year’s
    other paradigm-shifting game: Pokémon on the Game Boy.'
