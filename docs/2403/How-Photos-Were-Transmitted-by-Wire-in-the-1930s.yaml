- en: I didn’t know what to expect from this 1937 video explanation of how wire photos
    were transmitted to newspapers, but a double stunt sequence featuring an airplane
    and a death-defying photographer was not anywhere on my bingo card. This starts
    kinda slow but it picks up once they get into the completely fascinating explanation
    of how they sent photographs across the country using ordinary telephone lines.
    The whole setup was portable and they just hacked into a wire on a telephone pole,
    asked the operator to clear the line, and sent a photo scan via an analog modem.
    Ingenious!

    is worth a read — French designers argued that the technology was responsible
    for an early form of fast fashion.'

- en: After World War II at haute couture shows in Paris, Frederick L. Milton would
    sketch runway designs and transmit his sketches via Bélinographe to his subscribers,
    who could then copy Parisian fashions. In 1955, four major French couturiers (Lanvin,
    Dior, Patou, and Jacques Fath) sued Milton for piracy, and the case went to the
    Appellate Division of the New York Supreme Court. Wirephoto enabled a speed of
    transmission that the French designers argued damaged their businesses.
