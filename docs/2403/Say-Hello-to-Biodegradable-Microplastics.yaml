- en: Next the team used water flotation. Since plastics are not water soluble and
    they float, they can easily be scooped off the surface of water. At intervals
    of 90 and 200 days, almost 100% of the petroleum-based microplastics were recovered,
    meaning none of it had biodegraded. On the other hand, after 90 days, only 32%
    of the algae-based microplastics were recovered, showing that more than two thirds
    of it had biodegraded. After 200 days, only 3% was recovered indicating that 97%
    of it had disappeared.

    spectrometry (GCMS), which detected the presence of the monomers used to make
    the plastic, indicating that the polymer was being broken to its starting plant
    materials. Scanning-electron microscopy further showed how microorganisms colonize
    the biodegradable microplastics during composting.

    as we use it,” said Stephen Mayfield, a paper coauthor, School of Biological Sciences
    professor and co-founder of Algenesis. “This is more than just a sustainable solution
    for the end-of-product life cycle and our crowded landfills. This is actually
    plastic that is not going to make us sick.”

- en: Creating an eco-friendly alternative to petroleum-based plastics is only one
    part of the long road to viability. The ongoing challenge is to be able to use
    the new material on pre-existing manufacturing equipment that was originally built
    for traditional plastic, and here Algenesis is making progress. They have partnered
    with several companies to make products that use the plant-based polymers developed
    at UC San Diego, including Trelleborg for use in coated fabrics and RhinoShield
    for use in the production of cell phone cases.

    “Now we see a different reality. There's a lot of work to be done, but we want
    to give people hope. It is possible.”
