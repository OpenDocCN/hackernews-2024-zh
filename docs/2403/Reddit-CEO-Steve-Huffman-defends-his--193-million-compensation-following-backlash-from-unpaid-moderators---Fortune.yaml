    unnoticed. Since word got out about Huffman’s pay, users on Quora, Reddit, and
    [X](https://fortune.com/company/twitter/) have been ripping into the package.

    Huffman got a salary of $341,346 in 2023 and a $792,000 “incentive” bonus. In

    according to Huffman and the company SEC filing, the board canceled his existing
    stock awards and then granted him a new equity package in late 2023 that included
    stock, as well as stock options at various escalating strike prices.
