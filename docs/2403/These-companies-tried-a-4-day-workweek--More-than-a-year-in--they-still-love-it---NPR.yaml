    that allow all 10 employees to take Fridays off. They keep all meetings to 30
    minutes and make sure those meetings start on time. They block off focus time
    on their calendars — sometimes even declaring Monk Mode Mondays. They're more
    mindful of the emails they send and of the time they spend going through their
    inboxes.
