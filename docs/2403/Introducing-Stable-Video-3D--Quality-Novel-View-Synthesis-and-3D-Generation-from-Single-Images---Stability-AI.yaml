- en: When we released [Stable Video Diffusion](https://stability.ai/news/stable-video-diffusion-open-ai-video-model),
    we highlighted the versatility of our video model across various applications.
    Building upon this foundation, we are excited to release Stable Video 3D. This
    new model advances the field of 3D technology, delivering greatly improved quality
    and multi-view when compared to the previously released [Stable Zero123](https://stability.ai/news/stable-zero123-3d-generation),
    as well as outperforming other open source alternatives such as [Zero123-XL](https://objaverse.allenai.org/docs/zero123-xl/).

- en: By adapting our Stable Video Diffusion image-to-video diffusion model with the
    addition of camera path conditioning, Stable Video 3D is able to generate multi-view
    videos of an object. The use of video diffusion models, in contrast to image diffusion
    models as used in Stable Zero123, provides major benefits in generalization and
    view-consistency of generated outputs. Additionally, we propose improved 3D optimization
    leveraging this powerful capability of Stable Video 3D to generate arbitrary orbits
    around an object. By further implementing these techniques with disentangled illumination
    optimization as well as a new masked score distillation sampling loss function,
    Stable Video 3D is able to reliably output quality 3D meshes from single image
    inputs.

- en: Stable Video 3D introduces significant advancements in 3D generation, particularly
    in novel view synthesis (NVS). Unlike previous approaches that often grapple with
    limited perspectives and inconsistencies in outputs, Stable Video 3D is able to
    deliver coherent views from any given angle with proficient generalization. This
    capability not only enhances pose-controllability, but also ensures consistent
    object appearance across multiple views, further improving critical aspects of
    realistic and accurate 3D generations.
