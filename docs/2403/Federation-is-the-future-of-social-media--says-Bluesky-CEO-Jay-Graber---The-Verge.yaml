    competitor to Twitter, er, X. Bluesky actually started inside of what was then
    known as Twitter — it was a [project from then-CEO Jack Dorsey](/2019/12/11/21010856/twitter-jack-dorsey-bluesky-decentralized-social-network-research-moderation),
    who spent his days wandering the earth and saying things like Twitter should be
    a protocol and not a company. Bluesky was supposed to be that protocol, but Jack

    than 5 million users, and how so many of the company’s early decisions around
    product design and moderation have shaped the type of organic culture that’s taken
    hold there. Content moderation is, of course, one of the biggest challenges any
    platform faces, and Bluesky, in particular, has had its fair share of controversies.
    But the idea behind AT Protocol and Bluesky is devolving control, so Bluesky users
    can pick their own moderation systems and recommendation algorithms — a grand
    experiment that I wanted to know much more about.

    and protocols, which are the beating heart of the decentralization movement. Bluesky’s
    AT Protocol is far from the only protocol in the mix — there’s also ActivityPub,
    which is what powers Mastodon and, soon, Meta’s Threads. There’s been [some real
    animosity between these camps](https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/14/bluesky-and-mastodon-users-are-having-a-fight-that-could-shape-the-next-generation-of-social-media/),

    he was going to fund the development of a protocol that Twitter would someday
    run on. And so I came into the project as someone outside of Twitter that had
    never worked at Twitter but had experience with decentralized social protocols.
    So I built out a protocol, and then, through a series of changes of what happened
    to formerly Twitter, now we’ve ended up building an app that looks a lot like
    Twitter.

- en: So then I was one of the experts that they pulled into this small chat room
    with a group of people who seemed to know what they were talking about. And then,
    they asked the group, “What is the best way to build this protocol? You guys know
    about protocols.” And then, in 2020, the pandemic hit, and so this whole project
    got derailed by the pandemic as Twitter was clearly occupied with other things.

- en: And then mid-2021, Twitter circled back around and started interviewing people,
    both people within Twitter and experts without, interviewing somebody who could
    lead the Bluesky project. And so, mid-2021, they interviewed me along with some
    other folks and then chose me to lead Bluesky based on this vision that I pitched

- en: Once I took lead, there were different options as to how we were going to structure
    Bluesky. As a category, a project within Twitter, it was very much like Birdwatch,
    which was what built Community Notes, sort of a skunkworks project that was going
    to go off on its own and do this experimental way of doing things in a more open,
    crowdsourced way. But I didn’t want to be within Twitter because Twitter had moved

- en: One of the things that I was hyperaware of was just the risks of centralization
    because one thing I always like to say is the captain can always sink the ship.
    Jack was the captain of Twitter at that time, but if the captain changes or if
    that support left, then I would lose institutional support for Bluesky, and I
    really wanted this project to exist. So I insisted we spin out as a separate company,
    and then that took about six months to figure out, but then we got set up as a
    separate company, and then, actually shortly thereafter, the captain did change.
    And so then we ended up in this position — we were able to keep going. In a lot
    of other circumstances, if we were within Twitter, I don’t think the project would
    be alive anymore.

    Twitter 内部，我认为这个项目早就不复存在了。

    be the last social identity you’ll ever have to create because you can move it

    anyone building on either the interfaces for custom feeds or custom clients on
    Bluesky can come in and now build for 5 million users. But also, AT Protocol will
    be able to support other kinds of apps, and then users will be able to move between
    them with the same identity and relationships, and then that will just make it
    a lot easier for other people to build. And so that was part of our idea was just

    toward standardizing pieces of the protocol. So pieces that have become really
    stable, it’s working well. There hasn’t been any need for big changes recently.

    percent posters, and so it was extremely active and tons of people firing off
    shitposts essentially — really fast, funny takes on things and memes and a lot
    of stuff. And then, since we’ve grown, I think the majority of people tend to
    use social in a more consumption mode, and so it has shifted a bit more toward

    pieces that are relatively more solid, as I mentioned earlier. The AT Protocol
    is actually made up of several pieces that the way identity works, the way data
    works, and these pieces, we aim to get standardized and then stewarded by governance
    bodies.

- en: So, ActivityPub was around when we got started. I did an ecosystem review of
    all the centralized protocols that existed in 2019, including ActivityPub. And
    we looked at it and decided that we needed to build something different because
    there were some critical pieces that we thought were missing. So, one of them
    was around the composability and the interfaces for composability we’ve designed.
    Like the way that we do custom feeds and all these moderation labelers, that’s
    really not possible with the way that things are very server-centric in ActivityPub
    right now. Your server is very much your community where all of this happens,
    and we have split things up into these microservices on the backend, mirroring
    a bit more of how a large-scale social network works with the global feed.
  id: totrans-split-104

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 所以，ActivityPub在我们开始时已经存在了。我对2019年所有中心化协议进行了生态系统审查，包括ActivityPub。我们研究了它，并决定我们需要构建一些不同的东西，因为我们认为缺少一些关键部分。其中之一是围绕我们设计的可组合性和可组合性接口。比如我们如何定制订阅和所有这些审核标签，这在ActivityPub现在非常以服务器为中心的方式下是不可能的。你的服务器非常像是你社区的地方，所有这些事情都在那里发生，我们在后端将事情分成了这些微服务，更像是大规模社交网络的运作方式，有全球订阅。
- en: The other thing was the global feed, like having global search and discovery
    be a first-class thing that we were building for. And also, having all of our
    users at the start know that this is public data and it will be remixed in all
    sorts of ways by global feeds is something that, both technically and culturally,
    we had to design for. Because ActivityPub has clustered more around servers that
    they federate and they talk to each other, but there isn’t a service that scrapes
    all of it and gives you this big fire hose, and even if it’s technically possible
    to build, there’s been community resistance to people doing that. Even someone
    in the community who was building a bridge between AT Protocol and ActivityPub
    recently got a lot of pushback from the ActivityPub community on not wanting that
    bridge. So, that’s just sort of both cultural and technical.
  id: totrans-split-105
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 另一件事是全球订阅，比如将全球搜索和发现作为我们要构建的首要事物。还有，在开始时让所有用户知道这是公共数据，它将通过全球订阅以各种方式重新混合，这是我们在技术和文化上都必须设计的事情。因为ActivityPub更多地聚集在彼此联合和交流的服务器周围，但没有一个服务可以抓取所有内容并给你这样的大型信息流，即使从技术上讲是可以构建的，但社区对此的抵制很大。甚至最近有人在AT
    Protocol和ActivityPub之间建立桥梁时，也受到了ActivityPub社区的强烈反对。所以，这既是文化上的也是技术上的。
- en: Then another thing was we really wanted to get account portability. So, this
    ability to leave with your identity and your data and have fallbacks with the
    way that we’ve designed your repo, you can even back up all your posts on your
    phone or back it up on your server that you control, and then you don’t have to
    have any sort of friction when you want to move. So, you can move between services
    in ActivityPub. But if… for example, Queer.af recently, their .af domain was [seized
    by Afghanistan](/2024/2/12/24071036/queer-af-mastodon-taliban-shut-down-afghanistan),
    and then people were stuck because there was no warning, and then they have to
    rely on their old server to help forward their stuff over to a new place. So,
    we wanted to get around that problem and make sure people always had the ability
    to move.

  zh: 然后另一件事是我们真的想要账户可携带性。因此，这种能够带着你的身份和数据离开并有后备的方式，以我们设计的仓库，你甚至可以在手机上备份所有帖子或将其备份到你控制的服务器上，这样当你想要移动时就不会有任何摩擦。所以，在ActivityPub服务之间移动是可能的。但是……例如，最近Queer.af，他们的
    .af 域名被[阿富汗没收](/2024/2/12/24071036/queer-af-mastodon-taliban-shut-down-afghanistan)，人们就被困住了，因为没有警告，他们不得不依赖他们的旧服务器来帮助将东西转移到新地方。所以，我们希望解决这个问题，并确保人们始终有移动的能力。
- en: Then, we wanted to have good UX. There were just a lot of complaints with users
    around the UX of Mastodon, and we wanted to provide something that was more just
    tailored for the mainstream user who was used to Twitter, who could come on and
    not have to worry about, “Oh, what server do I pick when I sign up? What does
    it mean? Is this going to shape my experience forever?” On Mastodon, you have
    to know that right when you sign up because it’s going to shape your experience.
    Here, you can sign up on our server, which is the default lobby or gateway into
    the ecosystem, and then you can move to another server and shift to your own.
    So, when we opened up federation, several of our team members moved their main
    accounts off onto their own server, and it was pretty seamless. Nobody notices
    that people are running on their own servers, and it’s still just all one experience
    in the app.

    of live anywhere, and that’s the thing you’re in control of. On Mastodon, there

    on, since we’re getting technical now, I said we were borrowing from peer-to-peer
    systems. Peer-to-peer systems really try to do everything at entirely the user
    level with no servers. And that actually creates a complicated user experience,
    but that means that every user’s fully in control of all their data all the time.
    We have the ability for users to do that, but we have servers to make your life
    easier, so you don’t have to have your phone be trying to directly communicate
    with 5 million other phones or a computer trying to do that. But then you can
    always move off of our server and move off of these services.

    the user. And the other way we’ve designed around the user is not just at the
    technical level but at the UX level. So, try to design for: what do users really

    of the ideas that we had was, on Mastodon, your moderation is very much tied to
    who runs your server, but often, the type of person who wants to do DevOps essentially
    and manage a service online is different from the type of person who’s a community
    builder and wants to organize a group of people together to set a different set
    of community norms and moderate. You can get those people together to run a Mastodon
    instance, but it has to be tied around the instance, so we separated those pieces.
    So, now you can get a group of people together and run a moderation service. We
    give you software to manage reports and stuff like admin tooling, and you can
    do this with the whole team, and then you can get a bunch of people to use it,

    DevOps 并在线管理服务的人与想要组织一群人来设定不同社区规范并进行管理的人是不同的类型。你可以让这些人一起运行一个 Mastodon 实例，但它必须围绕这个实例来进行。所以我们分离了这些部分。现在，你可以让一群人一起来运行一个管理服务。我们为你提供管理报告等工具的软件，你可以和整个团队一起使用，然后你可以让一大群人来使用它，然后你可以建立一个基于你所创建的管理文化的整个社区。
- en: 'Then, you can do that with the feed as well. And then all these things, as
    I mentioned in being composable, can be bundled and unbundled in different ways,
    so you could recreate the Mastodon “everything is tied to your server” experience
    by setting defaults on your server: this is the moderation regimes we’re going
    to be using, here’s the labelers we’re using, here’s the feeds we’re using, etc.
    And a server operator still has power at the end of the day because they control
    where your stuff is literally hosted. But then there’s all these other interfaces
    beyond that where control and agency can happen. So, any service in the network
    has the ability to set rules, and then users have these interfaces where even
    if they’re non-technical, they can go in and create rule sets.'

    being different, there’s also this culture of resistance to global feeds and global

    if you have a protocol that lets servers talk to each other and federate, part
    of it is human governance, and if people who run that server don’t want to talk
    to you, then even if the computers can talk, they don’t have to talk. And so that’s
    essentially people in Mastodon expressing their preferences of the kind of communities
    they want, which is, they don’t want to talk to Bluesky users, so they can just
    not federate. And then there was a lot of discussion that was around opt-in versus

    things really centralize around that. And so, it might functionally not be very
    open because people are tied to the server and it’s hard to move, and it’s going
    to be really up to Threads whether they ever become fully protocol-compliant and

    of the night, is like, “I’ll look into it.” You see that reaction, like, “I’ll
    be the face of the thing.” To some extent, you’re the face of Bluesky. You’re
    here doing this interview, but you have an out. It’s come up several times in
    this conversation: “We’ll see what the marketplace does. We’ll see what the community
    does.” Do you feel that pressure to be the face and to be responsive, or do you
    think that that out will actually take hold?**'

  zh: '**好的，最后一个问题。感觉运行更集中的平台的人近期似乎对自家的发布者完全依附。比如，埃隆·马斯克似乎对推特上的发布者很响应。亚当·摩西里，在半夜时分，就像是，“我来查查这个。”你看到了那种反应，“我，要成为这个的面孔。”在一定程度上，你是Bluesky的面孔。你在这里进行这个访谈，但也有一定的退出，就像我们在这对话中提到的多次那样：“我们会看看市场会做些什么。我们会看看社群会做些什么。”你感到压力要成为这个面孔并保持响应吗，还是认为这个退出可能会真正实现？**'
- en: Yeah, I do, and I’ve accepted it to some extent, and I’ve also told people I
    am sort of the steward of this ecosystem right now and the creator of… let’s think
    of it as a city-state in an ecosystem we’re trying to build. My bio on Bluesky
    is, “Let’s build a federated republic starting with this server.” And so, there’ll
    be lots of other federations out there. I encourage you to start one, and I will
    do my best on this one.

  zh: 是的，我确实感觉到这种压力，并在一定程度上接受了它，同时也告诉过大家我目前是这个生态系统的管理者，也是这个“城市国家”（我们正在构建的生态系统）的创造者。我的Bluesky个人资料是，“让我们从这个服务器开始，构建一个联邦共和国。”所以，会有许多其他的联邦存在。我鼓励你开始自己的，我会尽我所能在这一个上做好。
- en: Something we joke about on the app is that “posters madness” is a real thing
    that people can get on social media. We try to do some internal awareness on becoming
    audience captured by our own audience and stay aware of that. And then also, I
    try to do my best to — I’m a poster — engage with the community but not be the
    main character all the time. There was a joke at Bluesky I found very funny, which
    is, “The one thing I love most about this app is I don’t know who the CEO is.”
    Just like, great. If it’s a thriving enough community where it doesn’t even need
    me as a main character, that’s great.

  zh: 我们在应用程序上开玩笑说，“发布者疯狂”在社交媒体上确实是个真实现象。我们尝试内部提升意识，防止被自己的受众俘获，并保持对此的意识。此外，我尽量——我也是发布者——与社群互动，但不总是成为主角。Bluesky上我找到的一个很好笑的例子是，“我最喜爱这个应用程序的一件事就是，我甚至不知道谁是CEO。”就像，太好了。如果它能成为一个足够繁荣的社群，不需要我作为主角，那就太好了。
- en: '**Well, Jay, that is an incredible place to end it. You’re a great main character,
    by the way. Thank you so much for being here.**'
