    occupied by households on the higher end of the income spectrum, the chain of
    residential moves brought about by their construction benefits many more households.
    Today’s lower-priced rental housing was often the new, expensive rental housing
    of yesteryear. And it doesn’t take decades for new apartments to put downward
    pressure on rents elsewhere in a metropolitan area. New units help keep current
    prices down for everyone by opening up new opportunities for low- and moderate-income
    renters over a few short years through a chain of residential moves.

    A renter named Maria moves into Jim’s old unit, which is more affordable than
    Jim’s new place. Another renter is going to move into Maria’s old unit. The chain
    will likely continue to include several more units, each progressively older and
    more affordable. It will end when someone moves out on their own from a previously
    shared living space.

    is one piece of a phenomenon known as *filtering*. Theories connecting filtering
    to housing affordability are [generally accepted among economists](https://www.jstor.org/stable/42920713?seq=3).
    For example, economic theory predicts that housing units should be relatively
    more affordable when the housing supply increases, as it does when new apartments
    open.

    a market creates new opportunities for their renters to move up. Staff at the
    Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis recently wrapped up a research project that
    involved interviews with 16 large-apartment owners and property managers in the
    Minneapolis-St. Paul metropolitan area. Regardless of whether they owned newer
    or older properties, these owners and managers often cited the increased housing
    supply in the region as a reason why rents at their properties generally had not
    increased very much in the past few years.

    Dame, has helped clearly track and document how filtering works at a granular
    level. Mast was able to precisely document the chain of moves that follows a move
    like Jim’s. In other words, he used a data source that allowed him to see where
    Jim moved from, where Maria moved from, and so forth.

    relatively quickly. He estimated that, within five years, the aggregated chain
    of residential moves ultimately results in about 70 new openings for renters in
    lower-income neighborhoods for every 100 new market-rate apartments.

    and new market-rate apartments in the Twin Cities area. Local policies and markets
    influence the pace of housing construction and, therefore, the scale of filtering.
    Mast’s model suggests that relative to new construction in other metropolitan
    areas, new units in the Minneapolis-St. Paul metro area are [even more likely
    to increase the availability of rental units in lower-income neighborhoods](/-/media/assets/events/2019/institute-fall-conference-housing-2019/3-institute-fall-19-mast.pdf).

    finding a new market-rate home—perhaps one with granite countertops, stainless
    steel appliances, and even a view of the river in downtown Minneapolis—have a
    ripple effect that can spread across the entire Twin Cities region and the entire
    income distribution. When more units open up, there’s a greater supply relative
    to demand and, as a result, lower rents.'

    Lower growth in a city’s housing supply leads to less filtering for *all* housing
    units. Unless there’s a huge drop in demand for housing, cities that don’t add
    to their housing supply will see more competition for fewer homes, and prices
    and rents will increase more quickly than they otherwise would.

    market. [Analysis by Liyi Liu and others at the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3527800#:~:text=This%20paper%20uses%20a%20repeat%20income%20model%2C%20building,within%20metropolitan%20statistical%20areas%20%28MSA%29%20and%20across%20time.)
    shows that filtering happens more slowly in places with more restrictions on construction.
    In places like San Francisco, filtering can even happen in reverse. When there
    are few homes relative to demand, older homes are more likely to be bought by
    higher-income households over time. This doesn’t just apply to Victorian-era mansions,
    but also to the less amenity-rich housing stock that used to be more accessible
    to first-time home buyers.

    This connection is at the center of many YIMBY, or “[yes in my backyard](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/where-pro-housing-groups-are-emerging/),”
    arguments to make housing construction easier. But skeptics may point out that
    higher-income households don’t only move into high-income areas; in some cases,
    they move into lower-income neighborhoods. And new buildings can be built in lower-income
    areas, too. How does filtering play out in those situations?

    Gentrification occurs when higher-income households move in large numbers into
    low-income neighborhoods. Displacement happens when home prices, rent growth,
    or competition from higher-income households cause low-income households to move,
    even if they’d rather stay put.

    suggests that gentrification alone does not increase involuntary moves by low-income
    households. Mast’s paper echoes [research](https://s3.amazonaws.com/media.hudson.org/files/publications/AffordableRentHousing2017.pdf)
    showing that high-income movers tend to create more opportunities through filtering
    than they take away through gentrification. His work also shows that the people
    who move into new housing in lower-income areas are most likely to come from other
    low-income neighborhoods. In a separate paper, Mast also finds that [rent growth
    is actually slower](https://direct.mit.edu/rest/article/105/2/359/100977/Local-Effects-of-Large-New-Apartment-Buildings-in)
    in low-income neighborhoods after new market-rate apartments are built.

    that diverge from the overall aggregate effect of filtering. In other words, details
    and local context matter. For example, filtering effects are likely to be smaller
    where rents are already relatively low and vacancy rates are already high; outside
    of revitalization projects, these areas are already unlikely to see much investment
    and new development.
