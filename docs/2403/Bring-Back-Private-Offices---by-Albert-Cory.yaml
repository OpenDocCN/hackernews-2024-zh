    calls and typing.

    components were more geared to individual workers than to large companies that
    needed to accommodate large numbers of people, and they were hard to put together.
    And the concept of a completely customizable workspace didn’t sit well with executives
    who didn’t value the individuality of their workers. Instead, they often purchased
    the furniture for their own homes rather than placing them in offices. Action
    Office was beloved by designers—and dismissed by just about everyone else.

    concept to the next level. The panels became miniature walls of multiple heights
    that separated each space into its own office without completely cutting a worker
    off from colleagues. Lightweight and easier to assemble, it made more sense to
    executives.

    the way Propst intended. Instead of going for roomy desk spaces with different
    designs and walls of different heights, they opted for tiny, boxed-in desks instead.
    They ignored Propst’s vision of a flexible workspace and visual sightlines. Using
    Propst’s brainchild, cubicles were used to cram even more workers into offices.
    The office he had invented shrank and shrank until it became impersonal and crowded.

    of the floors; grad students got tiny ones that two would barely fit in (but which
    had full walls and doors), faculty and research staff got larger solo ones. The
    key point though was at both ends of the floors were wide open areas, usually
    called a "Play-something"; playground, playroom, etc. Key aspects were a giant
    full wall whiteboard, couches and comfy chairs, the location of the floor water
    and coffee services, where tech reports were, coffee tables with a mix of research
    publications, newspapers, magazines, comic books, and other light reading, maybe
    some toys. If you wanted privacy and focus, you went to your office and shut the
    door. If you wanted to work but were open to interruption, you went to your office
    and left the door open. If you just wanted to hang out, collaborate, read in the

    I'm not even kidding. It was a 12' by 15' space and we crammed 7 desks in there
    (one staff was a night guy) and all had to sweat all over each other and breath
    the same stinky air for months. I finally quit and told them where to shove that
    job.

    along with “follow the current fad.” Take the rental for a square foot of office
    space, multiply that by the number of square feet each employee occupies, and
    you get a big cost. A private office with 80 or 100 square feet costs much more
    than the space for a desk, chair, and a filing cabinet. In theory, at least, cubicle
    walls are also simpler to reconfigure than hard office walls.

    asking rents in real terms.1 Rents in the US cities we studied fell especially
    sharply—for example, by 28 percent in San Francisco and by 18 percent in New York
    City from 2019 to 2022\. Rents in the European cities we studied have been more
    resilient. In Paris, London, and Munich, they fell by 10 percent, 12 percent,
    and 9 percent, respectively. In only two of the cities we studied, Munich and
    Tokyo, did rents actually increase; they grew the most in Tokyo, increasing by
    4 percent from 2019 to 2022.

    to the office less often, many employers have downsized spaces to reduce costs.
