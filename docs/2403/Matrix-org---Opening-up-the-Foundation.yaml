    it has been working on its independence. With lines more clearly defined between
    its major supporter Element and itself, the Foundation has been able to clarify
    its role. **The Foundation's major goal, alongside stewarding the specification,
    is to fill in the gaps where there is no direct organisational interest, to make
    the Matrix ecosystem grow.**

    to gather, share their insights and current situation, make decisions on what
    they want for the future of Matrix, and pool resources to make it happen.

    need to be addressed, but that they cannot address on their own. Indeed, some
    components of the Matrix ecosystem receive attention because they are commercially
    viable, if not already sustainable. Some other projects might not be possible
    to monetise ethically. Or it might make sense for a neutral organisation to act
    as a point of reference. One example would be a strong Trust & Safety suite.

    deliver on what matters the most to the ecosystem. For all the details on the
    Governing Board and its mission, please head to [Josh's excellent blog post](https://matrix.org/blog/2023/12/electing-our-first-governing-board).

    ecosystem. The Foundation hosts numerous projects, and directly contributes to
    some of them. But there are no guidelines regarding how a project becomes hosted
    or managed by the Foundation, nor any guidelines on who can gain or lose access
    to a repository.

- en: In coordination with the Governing Board, the Foundation will set-up processes
    to better define what a Foundation project is, how it can join the `matrix-org/`
    namespace on GitHub, how it is governed, and when it makes sense to contribute
    financially. This is particularly important to make sure that the Foundation is
    open to new contributors and projects.

    creating unnecessary top-down bureaucracy. We would rather experiment, see what
    processes actually work in practice, and then formalise and generalise them.

    difference between a project that stands the test of time and a project that fails.
