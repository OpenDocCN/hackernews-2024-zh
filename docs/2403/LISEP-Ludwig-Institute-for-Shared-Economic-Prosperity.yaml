- en: Using data compiled by the federal government’s Bureau of Labor Statistics,
    the True Rate of Unemployment tracks the percentage of the U.S. labor force that
    does not have a full-time job (35+ hours a week) but wants one, has no job, or
    does not earn a living wage, conservatively pegged at $25,000 annually before
    taxes.

    equitably, policymakers depend on economic indicators to shape economic policy.
    LISEP developed the True Rate of Unemployment to provide analysts and decision-makers
    with a more accurate measure of Americans’ financial well-being.
