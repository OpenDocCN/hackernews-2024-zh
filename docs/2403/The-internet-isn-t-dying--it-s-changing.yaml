    I believe it''s too far reaching and too deeply-embedded to really, truly be dying.
    What we''re seeing is a bust cycle for commercial social media and information-driven
    platforms. It''s pretty clear that traditional social media is on the wane — growth
    has plateaued for Facebook, cratered for Twitter (X — whatever) and Reddit''s
    besieged users are being fed into the gaping maw of yet another AI product. They''re
    not alone — so many of these platform companies are “evolving” to mine captive
    user data for AI models.'

- en: These platforms have been around for years now and their original promise of
    convenient, open community has proven to be either an outright lie or an easily
    abandoned promise as they cast about in search of any revenue they can find. We
    traded privacy and attention for convenience, allowing that convenience to evolve
    into lock-in and captivity.

    flourish. I *love* Mastodon and the community there — warts and all. It's imperfect,
    there are growing pains but there is also agency, openness, portability and user
    control. It may not scale to the global heights that some of these commercial
    enterprises have, but it's under no pressure to succumb to the same malign, financial
    imperatives.

    and similar walled-garden gatekeepers. We've been through this in that dial-up-enabled
    heyday and have followed a similar cycle once again. We can let these companies
    and gatekeepers fade because they aren't — and never were — the platform. The
    web has always been open and continues to be.

- en: So, yes, there are challenges and it's on us to rebuild communities, hold them
    together, tend to them and keep them open and supportive. We can do that on ActivityPub-based
    platforms, we can cast a wary eye towards BlueSky and hope that they keep to their
    decentralized approach (I remain concerned about funding and monetization), we
    can rebuild forums and we can make it easier for blogs to be built. Communication
    can be slower, smaller in scale and healthier. Write a blog post, read another
    and author a thoughtful response. We don't need to scroll endlessly and we don't
    need content to be infinitely available.

    growing wave of AI-generated content sludge — but — I remain hopeful. We have
    the tools to keep the internet open, compelling, kind and as weird as we'd like
    it to be. Gatekeepers stumbling, fading and grasping on their way out represents
    a change, not a death. I hope it's a last gasp of winter before a thaw and we
    can turn our attention towards tending to newer, healthier growth.
