    special piece of engineering comes along and recreates an instrument in a spectacular
    way. The instrument you can watch in the video below is actually a 100-year-old
    vintage grand piano that has been brought back to life by some very creative musicians.'

- en: The grand piano had been fitted with 20 instruments that can all be played using
    the keys of the piano. The musicians behind this interesting invention are a Ukrainian
    band called Brunettes Shoot Blondes. They’re an indie rock band based in Kiev,
    Ukraine, that formed at the beginning of 2010\. In the video, they’re playing
    their own original song called “Houston”.
