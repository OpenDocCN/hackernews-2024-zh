    library for the Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) protocol, an open standard
    for identity providers to authenticate users and pass authentication tokens to
    online services. This is the open protocol that enables single sign-on (SSO).
    The Lasso product is [dual licensed by Entr’Ouvert under GPL or commercial licenses](https://lasso.entrouvert.org/).

    Electronic Administration to develop parts of the [service-public.fr](http://service-public.fr)
    portal, which allows users to interact online with the government for administrative
    procedures. Orange used the Lasso software in the solution, but did not pass on
    the rights to its modifications free of charge under GPL, or make the source code
    to its modifications available.

    in 2010, and the case wended its way through the courts, turning on, among other
    things, issues of proof of Entr’Ouvert ‘s copyright interest in the software,
    and whether the case properly sounded in breach of contract or copyright infringement.

- en: On March 19, 2021, the Appeals Court first rejected Entr’Ouvert’s claims for
    copyright infringement, saying that the case was a breach of contract claim. The
    Court of Cassation, which is the supreme court of France, reviewed the case and
    issued an order on October 5, 2022 overturning the decision of the Court of Appeal.
    The case was then remanded to the Court of Appeal, which issued its order this
    week.

    disgorgement of profits of Orange. Moral damages compensate the plaintiff for
    harm to reputation or other non-monetary injury.
