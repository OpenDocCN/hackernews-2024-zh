    over the years that have been designed to cut down on over-stimulating distractions
    present on smartphones. The latest looks like a happy marriage between a Blackberry
    and e-reader, and goes by the name of Minimal.

- en: Only very basic information has been shared on the startup's website so far,
    but founder and CEO of the Minimal Company Andre Youkhma recently took to [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheMinimalCompany/comments/19a6xr5/join_me_for_an_ama_the_journey_of_the_minimal/?rdt=61127)
    to answer key queries.

- en: The Minimal phone is going to be constructed using eco-friendly materials, though
    no specifics have been revealed as yet. It will boast a backlit monochrome E Ink
    display topped with a capacitive touchscreen, which will doubtless make it a per-charge
    warrior as well as being eye-friendly. In fact, the 4,000-mAh battery is reckoned
    good for four days of usage and there's support for rapid charging. Under this
    sits a full QWERTY keyboard for a "more satisfying and accurate typing experience."

    is based on "the latest version of Android" and should allow access to the Play
    Store for downloading third-party apps.

    of the box it will be able to call, text and email and will host a bunch of "select
    third-party apps essential for modern living, such as ride-sharing or navigation
    apps, without overwhelming the user." Things like calendar, notes and other productivity
    tools will be included too.

    The handset will feature Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, with 5G currently being explored,
    and be able to play music from YouTube (though E Ink refresh rates likely won't
    make video watching anything but frustrating) and from local storage via a headphone
    jack. There's expected to be support for Android Auto too, and contactless payments
    are in the works. A camera is being cooked in as well, though we'll have to wait
    for details.

    be collected for phone functionality, not for advertising purposes. He also promises
    frequent security updates, with support for the phone promised for at least five
    years (which presumably will include OS upgrades).

- en: As of writing, all we have to look at are rather nice renders. Youkhma has confirmed
    that the design has been finalized, that it will come in at 120 x 72 x 10 mm (4.7
    x 2.8 x 0.39 in), and that an unnamed "leading manufacturer" is currently looking
    into creating molds and such.

    bid on a crowdfunding platform that's due to kick off from early February. The
    expected retail price is currently pitched in the region of US$400, but discounts
    will be offered to tempt in early adopters.
