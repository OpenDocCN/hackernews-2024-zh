- en: Only very basic information has been shared on the startup's website so far,
    but founder and CEO of the Minimal Company Andre Youkhma recently took to [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheMinimalCompany/comments/19a6xr5/join_me_for_an_ama_the_journey_of_the_minimal/?rdt=61127)

  zh: 创业公司网站上目前只分享了非常基础的信息，但Minimal公司的创始人兼CEO Andre Youkhma最近在[Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheMinimalCompany/comments/19a6xr5/join_me_for_an_ama_the_journey_of_the_minimal/?rdt=61127)上回答了一些关键问题。
- en: The Minimal phone is going to be constructed using eco-friendly materials, though
    no specifics have been revealed as yet. It will boast a backlit monochrome E Ink
    display topped with a capacitive touchscreen, which will doubtless make it a per-charge
    warrior as well as being eye-friendly. In fact, the 4,000-mAh battery is reckoned
    good for four days of usage and there's support for rapid charging. Under this
    sits a full QWERTY keyboard for a "more satisfying and accurate typing experience."

  zh: Minimal手机将采用环保材料制造，尽管目前没有具体细节。它将配备背光单色E Ink显示屏，顶部是电容触摸屏，这无疑会使它成为一款续航强悍且对眼睛友好的手机。事实上，其4000mAh电池可支持四天的使用时间，并支持快速充电。在屏幕下方配有全尺寸QWERTY键盘，提供更加令人满意和准确的打字体验。

- en: It's being designed to run on an operating platform called the MnmlOS, which
    is based on "the latest version of Android" and should allow access to the Play
    Store for downloading third-party apps.

  zh: 设计初衷是运行基于“最新Android版本”的MnmlOS操作系统，应该能够访问Play Store以下载第三方应用程序。
- en: However, the point of the phone is to keep distractions to a minimum, so out
    of the box it will be able to call, text and email and will host a bunch of "select
    third-party apps essential for modern living, such as ride-sharing or navigation
    apps, without overwhelming the user." Things like calendar, notes and other productivity
    tools will be included too.

  zh: 然而，这款手机的设计初衷是将干扰降到最低，因此开箱即用时只能进行打电话、发短信和电子邮件，同时提供了一些“对现代生活至关重要”的精选第三方应用程序，如共享乘车或导航应用，而不会使用户不知所措。还包括日历、笔记和其他生产工具。
- en: Entertainment will be kept simple as well, "focusing on relaxation and mindfulness."
    The handset will feature Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, with 5G currently being explored,
    and be able to play music from YouTube (though E Ink refresh rates likely won't
    make video watching anything but frustrating) and from local storage via a headphone
    jack. There's expected to be support for Android Auto too, and contactless payments
    are in the works. A camera is being cooked in as well, though we'll have to wait
    for details.

  zh: 娱乐功能同样简化，“专注于放松和正念”。该手机将支持Wi-Fi和蓝牙，目前正在探索5G，能够通过耳机插孔从YouTube播放音乐（尽管E Ink的刷新率可能使观看视频令人沮丧），并可以从本地存储播放音乐。预计还将支持Android
    Auto和无接触支付。相机也将被加入，尽管具体细节还需等待。
