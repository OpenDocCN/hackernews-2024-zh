    Facebook et. al. for the one art historian who reads this blog) to produce an
    AI and data classification tool. For some of you super slick operators out there
    in your diamond-clad superstructures, where Kubernetes is a real thing, the phrase
    "web-scale" doesn't make you assume your interlocutor is a moron, and you spend
    your days rightfully leering down at the little ants scurrying around from on
    high, this might seem like a very small amount of money. For this organization,
    $1M was the *largest* sum of money they had ever received - it immediately went
    on everyone's CV. Of course, only like three people were working on it, but everyone
    took credit nonetheless.

    company I've actually worked at with clear, unambiguous goals that were almost
    certainly achievable due to the volume of valuable data they had. And to top it
    off, it had *actual positive societal outcomes*. I was one of the two data scientists,
    joining the project at a late stage because it had been "lagging a bit". The experienced
    engineers are already upset. I believe it was in *The Mythical Man Month* that
    I read a project should "allow no small slippages" - something is either going
    to be on time or *considerably* delayed, although evidently we still haven't learned
    from a book written in 1975.

    someone to pair program with. The models were basically already working by the
    time I joined, so all that was left was to check in on the last member of the

    Every competitor in the state is copying our implementation. On my first day,
    they tell me that all ETL metadata and logging is stored in DynamoDB because it
    is more flexible.

- en: The preferred option is [Liberapay](https://en.liberapay.com/Ludic/) because
    it is open-source and aligned with the principles of this community. However [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/ludic190/membership)
    is also available in case you already have an account and just want to click the
    buttons fast.

  zh: 首选选项是[Liberapay](https://en.liberapay.com/Ludic/)，因为它是开源的，并且与这个社区的原则保持一致。然而，如果您已经有账户并且只想快速点击按钮，也可以选择[Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/ludic190/membership)。

    However, you will probably get my writing forever, for free. The "probably" is
    not because I'd start charging, but because life might get in the way at times,
    and there might be breaks in my output. And the currently-being-recorded podcast
    will also probably be free forever, though this might actually have some paywalled
    episodes one day if it is time-consuming enough - editing audio doesn't sound
    as fun as writing. But of course, even then I'm promising right now, with God
    as my witness, that I'd hand it out for free to anyone that can't justify the
    expense because I have something called *ethics*/*bad business sense*.

  zh: 其原因写在[此文](https://ludic.mataroa.blog/blog/on-authenticity-and-whats-worth-doing/)中。然而，您可能会永远免费阅读我的文字作品。“可能”不是因为我会开始收费，而是因为生活有时可能会妨碍到我的输出，并且可能会有一些中断。当前正在录制的播客也可能会永远免费，尽管如果编辑音频变得耗时，可能会有一天会有一些需要付费的集数。但当然，即使那时候，我现在就承诺，以我的良心为证，我会免费提供给任何不能负担费用的人，因为我有所谓的*伦理道德*/*糟糕的商业观念*。

    the cost of extending my weekly music classes from 30 minutes to 45 minutes, and
    eventually paying for hosting a cheap server or two that I'll use to deploy some
    stuff to help coordinate our community.

    be done or no new readers will ever know the links are there). And then I won't
