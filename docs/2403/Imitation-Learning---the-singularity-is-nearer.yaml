    image, then used a PID loop to bring the wheel to that desired angle.

    would drive for maybe 10 seconds, but then [error would accumulate](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/pub_files/2015/3/InvitationToImitation_3_1415.pdf)
    and it would drift to one side of the lane or the other (funny enough, it did
    show reluctance to cross the lane line, but it was unusable as an ADAS system)

    Unlike steering angle, which has a simple sensor to measure it, “lane lines” don’t
    have a clear definition. They broke the end-to-endness of the system.

- en: We referred to lanes as the “original sin” of comma, and tried really hard to
    remove them. I’m sad to say that there’s still lanes in our ground truthing stack
    today, but we have [made amazing strides](https://blog.comma.ai/end-to-end-lateral-planning/)
    in removing them, to the point that openpilot in 2020 could [drive on a dirt road](https://twitter.com/comma_ai/status/1309248079808229377?lang=en)
    without any lane lines.

    We have extended this to removing explicit use of cars with [experimental mode](https://blog.comma.ai/090release/),
    but some of our hand coded assumptions break down a bit more in the longitudinal
    case vs the lateral case.

    always are. And even if they aren’t correlated, that error *still* grows unbounded.
    You need them to be **anti-correlated**. You need the limit of that sum to be
    0.
