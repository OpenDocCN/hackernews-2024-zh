- en: The technique is called audio fingerprinting, and you can learn how it works
    in our [previous article](https://fingerprint.com/blog/audio-fingerprinting/).
    In a nutshell, audio fingerprinting uses the browser’s [Audio API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API)
    to render an audio signal with [OfflineAudioContext](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/OfflineAudioContext)
    interface, which then transforms into a single number by adding all audio signal
    samples together. The number is the fingerprint, also called “identifier”.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The audio identifier is stable, meaning it doesn’t change when you clear the
    cookies or go into incognito mode. This is the key feature of fingerprinting.
    However, the identifier is not very unique, and many users can have the same identifier.

    For example, when they want to sign in to your account or use stolen credit card
    credentials. Fingerprinting can identify repeat bad actors, allowing you to prevent
    them from committing fraud. However, many people see it as a privacy violation
    and therefore don’t like it.

    A fingerprint is a sum of 500 audio samples, and each audio sample is added with
    a random number with a [uniform distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_uniform_distribution).
    Therefore, according to [the central limit theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_limit_theorem),
    the fingerprint noise has a [normal distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution).
    The mean of the distribution is the un-noised fingerprint that we want to find.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    more fingerprint samples to reduce the noise. So, to reduce the noise in a reasonable
    time, we changed the fingerprinting algorithm to collect only one audio sample,
    which has a uniform noise distribution. The exact number of randomized samples
    needed depends on the rounding precision we need, which will be demonstrated later.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The algorithm change also means new fingerprints aren’t compatible with old
    fingerprints. Because of the rounding, the audio fingerprint will change, so sticking
    to the old fingerprint identifiers is useless. Note that you need to use [a special
    approach](https://github.com/fingerprintjs/fingerprintjs/blob/5ae80b7b946fcd824e35d033bc44e180334109f6/docs/version_policy.md#how-to-update-without-losing-the-identifiers)

    degrades 1.5–2 times. Even so, the new fingerprint algorithm takes little time
    to compute, even on low-end devices.

- en: The browser delegates some work to the OfflineAudioRender thread, freeing the
    main thread. Therefore, the page stays responsive during most of the audio fingerprint
    calculation. Web Audio API is not available for [web workers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API),
    so we cannot calculate audio fingerprints there.

- en: To improve the performance, the new fingerprint can be used only in Safari 17
    while keeping the old algorithm in other browsers. Check whether the current browser
    is Safari 17 or newer using the user-agent string. Based on that, run either the
    old or the new fingerprinting algorithm.

- en: Privacy-focused browsers like Tor and Brave also make attempts to restrict audio
    fingerprinting. Web Audio API is completely disabled in Tor, so audio fingerprinting
    is [impossible](https://gitlab.torproject.org/legacy/trac/-/issues/21984). Brave,
    however, follows an approach like Safari 17 and adds noise to the audio signal.
    Our [previous article](https://fingerprint.com/blog/audio-fingerprinting/#brave)
    explains more about Brave’s audio fingerprinting protection.
  prefs: []

- en: The Brave noise has an important difference. While Safari adds a random noise
    for each audio sample individually, Brave makes a random multiplier (called “fudge
    factor”) once and uses it for all audio samples. That is, all audio samples are
    multiplied by the same number. The fudge factor persists within a page. It changes
    only in a new regular or incognito session.

- en: No matter how many audio sample copies we make, the noise addition will be the
    same in every copy. The copies won’t be dispersed around the true (before noising)
    audio sample. Therefore, [the mathematical denoising method](#step-1-cutting-through-the-noise)
    doesn’t work.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Nevertheless, the Brave denoising method described in [the previous article](https://fingerprint.com/blog/audio-fingerprinting/#brave)
    still works. [The method for increasing the difference between fingerprints produced
    by browsers](#step-2-push-browser-identifier-numbers-farther-apart) can also increase
    the error tolerance.

- en: The new audio fingerprinting algorithm replaced the old one in FingerprintJS.
    It was first published in version [4.2.0](https://github.com/fingerprintjs/fingerprintjs/releases/tag/v4.2.0).
    You can see the full code for the audio fingerprint implementation [in our GitHub
    repository](https://github.com/fingerprintjs/fingerprintjs/blob/c411aff111e5c79cdc37608d42632d4a66a8c1dc/src/sources/audio.ts).

- en: Audio fingerprinting is one of the many signals our [source-available library](https://github.com/fingerprintjs/fingerprintjs)
    uses to generate a browser fingerprint. However, we do not blindly incorporate
    every signal available in the browser. Instead, we analyze the stability and uniqueness
    of each signal separately to determine their impact on fingerprint accuracy.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For audio fingerprinting, we found that the signal contributes only slightly
    to uniqueness but is highly stable, resulting in a slight net increase in fingerprint
    accuracy.
