    of the sensitive information that U.S. agencies shared at a closed-door classified
    intelligence briefing Wednesday about the influence and reach of TikTok.

    legislation](/2024/03/13/1237501725/house-vote-tiktok-ban) that would force the
    Chinese owner of TikTok to divest or face a ban in the United States. But it's
    clear that any Senate action could take weeks, if not months, and the chamber
    is likely to put its own stamp on a bill.

    endorsed the House bill and told reporters he backed declassifying some of the
    analysis communicated in the briefing, which he organized for his colleagues to
    discuss the impact of the video-sharing app.

    security concerns, a key committee approved a bill 50-0\. The measure was then
    overwhelmingly approved by the House 352-65\. But Warner said there is a need
    for more senators and the public to process the information, and the senators
    aren't likely to act as swiftly as their House counterparts, despite many echoing
    concerns about the issues posed by the app.

    heads," Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., told reporters while leaving the session,
    adding, "The Chinese Communists are weaponizing information that they are constantly,
    surreptitiously collecting from 170 million Americans and potentially aiming that
    information, using it through algorithms at the core of American democracy."'

    that what is known publicly already demonstrates the threat to users' personal
    data security and to national security. Pressed on the details of evidence about
    data directly shared with Chinese government officials, Cotton pointed to the
    terms and conditions stating that the app can access data once it's downloaded.
    "TikTok and ByteDance and Chinese leaders go to great lengths to try to conceal
    what they are doing," he said. He also pointed to TikTok's lobbying campaign of
    targeting messages to users during last week's House debate, urging them to try
    to influence American political debate.

    of the algorithm to highlight specific political points of view. Cotton pointed
    to what he described as a "clear skew in pro-Hamas propaganda on TikTok versus
    other social media apps" and added, "You don't need an academic study to use common
    sense."

    of use of multiple social media platforms. Markey declined to say whether he opposes
    the House bill, but he said the media's coverage of the debate over TikTok was
    "allowing one company to dominate the discussion, which is every American company
    is part of that very same threat that is occurring right now, not in the future."
    Markey said he has sponsored broader bills with new guardrails around all social
    media companies, and he told reporters at the Capitol, "I need them to move."

    up to U.S. users as a key reason why Congress needs to act. "That algorithm in
    a moment of conflict or an ongoing basis can be altered in order to drive certain
    messages, to divide Americans, to destabilize our politics, to influence policymakers,
    to denigrate policymakers, to tear our country apart, and China clearly wants
    to achieve that."
