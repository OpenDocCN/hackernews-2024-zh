    the most difficult aspect of a colonoscopy. This is due in part to the unavoidable,
    unpleasant process of drinking a purgative so that we can get a clear view of
    the colon. But there’s a second, unnecessary part: Most colonoscopy instructions
    direct the patient to stick to a clear liquids-only diet for much of the day before,
    or even for the entire day. On the surface, the rationale seems sound: Sticking
    to liquids should make it easier for the laxative to do its work. Some colonoscopies
    are unsuccessful or need to be repeated early because of an inadequate preparation,
    so it makes sense to stick to liquids and reduce the amount of solid waste.'

    obscure our views of the colon: corn, nuts, seeds, and many kinds of vegetables.
    But that leaves many solid foods that people can eat and digest without affecting
    the quality of their colonoscopy. A low-residue diet, one that is heavy on starch
    and protein and free of vegetables, is just as effective, and much less difficult
    to endure, than a diet restricted to clear liquids all day. (I have seen corn

    clear liquids only, or a diet that permits solid foods such as a bagel with cream

    good clean-outs as the spartan clear-liquids-only group. There were some differences,

    Gastroenterologists may not know about these studies, and they are not learning
    from patients or colleagues that their preparation dietary instructions are associated
    with worse patient satisfaction and possibly increased cancellation rates. But
    knowledge of the literature may not be enough to convince our specialty to make
    this change. When I ask my colleagues why they continue to prescribe a clear-liquid
    diet, the most common answer I get is some version of this: “My patients may have
    difficulty understanding the nuances of the low-residue diet.” This strikes me
    as pessimistic and even paternalistic. If it were really so hard to stick to this
    diet, we would not have seen the clinical trials show such a strong and consistent
    result.'

    the pharmaceutical industry and government regulatory authorities, the common

    inertia can be powerful. But change may yet occur, first slowly, and then rapidly
    once a critical mass is attained. This will happen one gastroenterologist or one

    and plain yogurt. They must avoid the following: popcorn, seeds, nuts, corn, multigrain
    bread, salad, raw and dried fruits, berries, kiwi, broccoli, cauliflower, Brussels
