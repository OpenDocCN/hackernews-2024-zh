    was an auditory event. This was true even for literate individuals reading on
    their own, though for another reason. The practice among ancient copyists, Greek
    as well as Roman, was to run all the letters INATEXTTOGETHERLIKETHIS. The style
    was called *scripta continua* and meant readers usually vocalized the syllables
    as they teased out the words.

- en: When silent reading came into vogue in the Middle Ages following the new practice
    of adding spaces between words, readers began to use different verbs to describe
    their activity. To read in the old mode was *legere* in Latin, which shares a
    root with our words *legible* and also *select*; it implied the act of reading
    meant picking out the syllables from a continuous river of letters.

    out in his history *[Spaces Between Words](https://www.sup.org/books/title/?id=683)*,
    word separation changed the act of reading enough that the verbs used to describe
    the activity followed suit. Instead of *legere*, readers were now said to *videre*
    or *inspicere*, to “see” or to “gaze.”

    a sentence. Instead, they could simply see the distinct words and silently register
    them in their mind. And contra the point raised by Prior and affirmed by myself,
    this distinction emerged when there was no confusion about the format. A book
    was a book. The verbs depended not on the thing but the activity, a choice that
    would seem to parallel our distinction between listening and reading.
