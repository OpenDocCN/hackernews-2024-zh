    overnight: With the onset of the pandemic in March 2020, more than half of workers
    began working from home at least part of the time, according to Gallup. But the
    shift to a permanent hybrid-work reality has been gradual, with [periods of tension](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/09/business/return-to-work-office-plans.html)
    as workers across white-collar industries pushed against executives’ [return-to-office
    orders](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/11/business/return-to-office-2022.html).'

    hybrid-work status quo. Roughly one-tenth of workers are cobbling together a combination
    of work in the office and from home, and a similar portion are working entirely
    remotely.

    were in many cases able to do their jobs safely at home, but lower-income workers
    often had to continue to work in person, even when health risks were highest.
    And now that the public health emergency is over, that workplace divide — who
    gets the benefits of remote flexibility and who does not — has become entrenched.

    jobs, they are more likely to have the opportunity to work remotely part or all

    college degrees. Many work in jobs like food service that cannot be done remotely.
    But that is not the whole story: Even among college graduates, workers in their
    20s are more likely to be in the office full time than their older colleagues.
    That suggests that young workers are embracing the benefits of in-person work:
    socialization, mentorship and face time with the boss. The potential downsides
    of fixed office schedules may also matter less to them: Relatively fewer young
    workers might have children (or aging parents) at home, making remote flexibility
    less of a priority.'

    more women have college degrees, so more of them are in the kind of professional

    or customer support role, while men more often work in construction, manufacturing
