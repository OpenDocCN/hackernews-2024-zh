    a weekly report for my contracting clients to prove their web host was unreliable,
    to the point where it was costing them significant money. They were paying for
    the cheapest possible tier of WordPress hosting at the time, and didn't believe
    me when I said random 5 minute blocks of downtime throughout the day were adding

    are the customers who will ask for the most support.

    tons of free users, it was expensive with little return to the business, so I
    eventually had to trim down the free tier to a level that the business *could*
    support.
