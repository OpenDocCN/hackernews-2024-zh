- en: OnlineOrNot [(this website)](https://onlineornot.com/) started because I needed
    a weekly report for my contracting clients to prove their web host was unreliable,
    to the point where it was costing them significant money. They were paying for
    the cheapest possible tier of WordPress hosting at the time, and didn't believe
    me when I said random 5 minute blocks of downtime throughout the day were adding
    up.

    customer to cheap out in other parts of their business, making them unpleasant
    to deal with. At $9/mo, you can't afford to spend much time on support - and these
    are the customers who will ask for the most support.
  prefs: []

- en: I also initially made a free tier to attempt to compete with other players in
    the market, offering dozens of uptime checks for free. Again, while this attracted
    tons of free users, it was expensive with little return to the business, so I
    eventually had to trim down the free tier to a level that the business *could*
    support.
