    that Joe Biden would make a major push to expand the nation’s housing supply—a
    possibility that worried the yes-in-my-backyard activists who push for more construction
    in communities across the country. Political polarization in the United States
    has grown so dire that getting the president on your side can backfire. The morning
    of the speech, the White House rolled out [some modest proposals](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/03/07/fact-sheet-president-biden-announces-plan-to-lower-housing-costs-for-working-families/#:~:text=The%20President%20is%20proposing%20that,assist%20nearly%20380%2C0000%20households.),
    but fortunately for the activists, Biden himself offered only brief, mild comments
    on the subject, which were inevitably overwhelmed by commentary on more contentious
    issues.

    Brian Hanlon, the CEO of the advocacy group California YIMBY, told me, referencing
    [political-science research](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1540-5907.2011.00541.x)
    indicating that if a president takes a strong public stand on an issue, people
    from the other party are less likely to back it.

    and, most recently, in vitro fertilization—have supporters across the ideological
    spectrum but nevertheless have become mired in red-blue polarization, blocking
    what could be bipartisan legislation to address major issues facing Americans.
    In Congress, lawmakers regularly work together across the aisle, but on one condition:
    The issue in question can’t be too politically salient—that is, the type of issue
    that voters *really* care about. This is why Congress can pass laws about subsidizing
    semiconductors but not laws addressing immigration.'

    gain enough attention without getting caught up in the polarization vortex. And
    no movement is walking this tightrope more precariously than the YIMBYs—who typically
    favor easing restrictions on housing development.

    after serving on the Bay Area Rapid Transit Board of Directors. But as the housing-affordability
    crisis spread to cities and states across the nation, so too has the network of
    activists, lawyers, elected officials, and policy wonks. That movement has now
    taken root not just in liberal enclaves such as San Francisco and Portland, Oregon,
    but also in Salt Lake City and Whitefish, Montana.

    boards one by one to pushing governors and legislatures to ease zoning rules and
    other housing-supply constraints across entire states. Henry Honorof, the director
    of a loose national coalition of pro-housing groups, told me that no state has
    passed pro-housing legislation without bipartisan support. Even in solidly blue
    California, Democratic YIMBYs need Republican converts. Helpfully, making housing
    more affordable appeals to equity-minded leftists, while deregulating the private
    market appeals to property-rights-loving conservatives.

    In an August 2020 *Wall Street Journal* [op-ed](https://www.wsj.com/articles/well-protect-americas-suburbs-11597608133)
    co-authored with his secretary of housing and urban development, Trump warned
    that the “left wants to take [the] American dream away from you” by pushing for
    “high-density housing.” He escalated these attacks on Twitter, [on the campaign
    trail](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/10/01/how-white-grievance-politics-informs-trumps-campaign-playbook-424590),
    and even, obliquely, [on the debate stage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vi-c594fLzI).
    Yet Republicans and Democrats did not sort themselves into NIMBY and YIMBY camps,
    at least in part because news outlets and voters were so focused on COVID-19 that
    housing policy got little attention.

    have gained ground. In conservative Montana, an anti-California message spurred
    lawmakers into passing pro-development bills; in Washington State, ambitious proposals
    were passed in the name of affordability and racial equity. But members face pressure
    on both sides to abandon ship. How long can they hold on?

    But the gang gets together periodically for a national conference amusingly called
    “YIMBYtown”—the rare place where you might find socialists, centrist economists,
    and Trump-supporting elected officials all in the same room, working toward the
    same goal. But when I attended this year’s event, in Austin, Texas, some cracks

    of “criminalizing unhoused people” and faulted four local progressive city-council

    Austin pointed to perhaps the greater threat: The coalition could fall apart starting
    from the left. During the question-and-answer period that followed the protest,
    one audience member asked panelists to discuss the concerns about displacement
    that low-income residents of many communities express. “The people who are screaming

    expressing misgivings about the prominent role played by Montana’s Republican
    governor, Greg Gianforte, and urging fellow housing advocates to do better. Even
    as YIMBYs were notching up wins in Montana, Reed noted, state lawmakers expelled
    a trans colleague from the floor. By highlighting conservatives such as Gianforte,
    Reed argued, the movement “feeds the perception” that it’s for “white libertarian
    bros.”

    he expressed no misgivings about joining with conservatives on housing policy.
    “I’m in the South, red state,” he said. “This can be a bipartisan issue.” For
    a former minister who has worked to enact progressive policy change in conservative
    states, compromise is a way of life. “I’m always trying to find the ecumenical,
    theological, philosophical position of welcoming the neighbor,” Burnside explained.
    “Even if that neighbor does not look like me. Even if that neighbor doesn’t think
    like I think … I got my patch, you got your patch, but in order for us to become
    a whole carpet we gotta find some places that we weave in the middle.”

    everyone in a community suffers when housing prices soar. Checking Zillow is a
    nonpartisan activity. The other thing keeping the coalition together is that,
    well, it’s barely a coalition at all. YIMBYs work in the context of their own
    states and cities. No national group dictates the bills they support or the messages

    was waiting for updates about the state Senate vote for the [Arizona Starter Homes
    Act](https://www.azleg.gov/legtext/56leg/2R/bills/HB2570P.htm), a bill that would
    prevent cities with populations exceeding 70,000 from requiring large lot sizes
    and large square footage, and from imposing other regulations that push houses
    to be more expensive.

    the House with 15 Democrats and 18 Republicans voting for it, while 13 Democrats

    recounted that the bill’s passage in the House coincided with a [heated partisan
    debate over an anti-immigration bill](https://azmirror.com/2024/02/28/skipping-public-hearings-republicans-rammed-through-a-bill-to-enforce-federal-immigration-law/)
    that Democratic Governor Katie Hobbs has already promised to veto. How did Democratic
    legislators go from arguing about the most divisive border-state issue to crossing
    the aisle and voting with their opponents on a Republican-led pro-housing bill?

    she’s still considering whether or not to sign the Arizona Starter Homes Act,
    noting that she prefers legislation with support from local jurisdictions, and
    this bill has been opposed by the local-government lobby. Either way, the political
