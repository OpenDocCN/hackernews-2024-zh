- en: '**Alexandre-Theophile Vandermonde**''s father was a medical doctor who was
    originally from Landrices but had spent 12 years in the Orient. He had set up
    a medical practice in Paris and was working there as a doctor when his son Alexandre-Théophile
    was born. He did not encourage his son to follow a medical profession but rather
    encouraged him to take up a career in music. Certainly he was not interested in
    mathematics when he was young. Alexandre-Théophile was awarded his bachelier on
    7 September 1755 and his licencie on 7 September 1757.'

- en: His first love was music and his instrument was the violin. He pursued a music
    career and he only turned to mathematics when he was 35 years old. It was [Fontaine
    des Bertins](../Fontaine_des_Bertins/) whose enthusiasm for mathematics rubbed
    off on Vandermonde. Perhaps surprisingly he was elected to the [Académie des Sciences](../../Societies/Paris/)
    in 1771 with little evidence of his mathematical genius other than his first paper
    which, although he was not a member at the time, was read to the Academy in November
    1770. However, he did make quite a remarkable contribution to mathematics in this
    paper and three further papers which he presented to the Academy between 1771
    and 1772. These four papers represent his total mathematical output and we will
    discuss their content below together with the views of a number of historians
    of mathematics on his contribution.

- en: Vandermonde's election to the [Académie des Sciences](../../Societies/Paris/)
    did motivate him to work hard for the Academy and to publish other works on science
    and music. In 1777 he published the results of experiments he had carried out
    with [Bézout](../Bezout/) and the chemist Lavoisier on low temperatures, in particular
    investigating the effects of a very severe frost which had occurred in 1776. Ten
    years later he published two papers on manufacturing steel, this time joint work
    with [Monge](../Monge/) and Bertholet. The aim of this research was to improve
    the steel used for bayonets but experimenting with different mixtures of iron
    and carbon. That he work closely with [Monge](../Monge/) reflected the fact that
    the two were very close friends; in fact, so close, that he was known as *femme
    de Monge*.

- en: In 1778 Vandermonde presented the first of a two part work on the theory of
    music to the [Académie des Sciences](../../Societies/Paris/). The second part
    was presented two years later. This work *Système d'harmonie applicable à l'état
    actuel de la musique* Ⓣdid not propose a mathematical theory of music as one might
    have expected from someone who was an expert in both fields. On the contrary the
    aim of the work was to put forward the idea that musicians should ignore all theory
    of music and rely solely on their trained ears when judging music. As one might
    expect this proved a controversial work with musicians being sharply divided as
    to whether they agreed with Vandermonde or not. Despite the opposition of many
    musicians at first, the ideas put forward by Vandermonde gained favour over the
    years and by the beginning of the nineteenth century the [Académie des Sciences](../../Societies/Paris/)
    had moved music from the mathematical area to the arts area. It is worth repeating
    that it is strange that a mathematician of the highest rank should have argued
    against music as a mathematical art, a position it had held since the days of
    ancient Greece.

    et Métiers in 1782 and chief of the Bureau de l'Habillement des Armées in 1792.
    In the same year of 1792 he sat with [Lagrange](../Lagrange/) on a committee of
    the [Académie des Sciences](../../Societies/Paris/) which had to examine the violon
    harmonique, a newly invented musical instrument. He was involved with the École
    Normale, which was founded in October 1794, and was on the team designing a course
    in political economy. His friend [Monge](../Monge/) was also involved with the
    École Normale as were [Lagrange](../Lagrange/) and [Laplace](../Laplace/). However
    the establishment only operated for six months after it opened in the Muséum d'Histoire
    Naturelle in January 1795 before being closed down.

- en: Like [Monge](../Monge/), Vandermonde was a strong supporter of the Revolution
    which began with the storming of the Bastille on 14 July 1789. The politics of
    Revolution in France long before this event had been so exciting for Vandermonde
    that it diverted him from a possible longer mathematical and scientific career.
    However the truth of the matter is that he suffered from poor health all his life
    and, but for this, he might well have been able to be highly involved in politics
    yet continue with mathematical and scientific activities.

- en: Perhaps the name of Vandermonde is best known today for the Vandermonde [determinant](../../Glossary/#determinant).
    While it is certainly true that he made a major contribution to the theory of
    determinants, yet nowhere in his four mathematical papers does this determinant
    appear. It is rather strange, therefore, that this determinant should be named
    after him and several authors have puzzled over the fact for some time. [Lebesgue](../Lebesgue/)'s
    conjecture in [[3](#reference-3)] (first published in 1940) that it resulted for
    someone misreading Vandermonde's notation, and therefore believing that this determinant
    was in his work, seems the most likely.

    functions of the powers of such roots. Neither of these were new having appeared
    in [Waring](../Waring/)'s work shortly before but, although he was aware of this
    Vandermonde claimed, rightly in my [EFR] opinion, that his approach was sufficiently
    different to make publication of these results for a second time worthwhile. The
    paper also shows that if <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>n</mi></mrow><annotation

    on the chess board. This paper is an early example of the study of topological
    ideas. Vandermonde considers the intertwining of the curves generated by the moving
    knight and his work in this area marks the beginning of ideas which would be extended
    first by [Gauss](../Gauss/) and then by [Maxwell](../Maxwell/) in the context
    of electrical circuits.

- en: The reason for this strong claim by [Muir](../Muir/) is that, although mathematicians
    such as [Leibniz](../Leibniz/) had studied determinants earlier than Vandermonde,
    all earlier work had simply used the determinant as a tool to solve linear equations.
    Vandermonde, however, thought of the determinant as a function and gave properties
    of the determinant function. He showed the effect of interchanging two rows and
    of interchanging two columns. From this he deduced that a determinant with two
    identical rows or two identical columns is zero. Finally he gave a remarkably
    clever notation for determinants which has not survived.
