- en: Earlier this week, [a group claimed to have successfully hacked Epic Games](https://www.thegamer.com/ransomware-hacker-group-reportedly-steal-189gb-epic-games-data/),
    making off with 189GB of data, including information on users. However, they're
    now walking back on these claims, saying that they faked the entire thing so they
    could scam actual hackers.

- en: The group, known as Mogilevich online, says that it did this by telling would-be
    hackers it would sell them the tech used to get into [Epic Games](https://www.thegamer.com/tag/epic-games/).
    Of course, if the hack didn't happen in the first place, then the tech and data
    they sent on would be useless - if they sent any at all. Mogilevich says that
    it sold this material to eight buyers, all without providing proof that they could
    hack a company like Epic.

    share any proof that the hack had taken place.

    and comes just days after the "hack" was first reported. Mogilevich claimed to
    have made off with "emails, passwords, full names, payment information, source
    code" from its attack on Epic and was seemingly trying to ransom the data back
    to the company.

- en: But now, Mogilevich has completely changed its story. We can't verify if the
    group's version of events is true or not, as it's very possible that they did
    pull off a hack and this is all misdirection. However, it does line up with what
    Epic has said on the matter, as it previously told TheGamer that there was "zero
    evidence" that a hack had taken place at all.

    are legitimate. Mogilievich has not contacted Epic or provided any proof of the
    veracity of these allegations.

    you need," says a member of Mogilevich, reportedly speaking on a page that it
    initially claimed would contain material from the Epic hack. "In reality, we are
    not a ransomware-as-a-service, but professional fraudsters."

    gain new contacts to scam. The group says that, in this regard, it all went according
    to plan, as would-be hackers apparently sent over tens of thousands of dollars.

    you can call us that", the statement reads. They admit that their aim was to gain
    access to new "victims to scam", although hopefully, these victims don''t include
    Epic Games employees and users.'
