    making off with 189GB of data, including information on users. However, they're
    now walking back on these claims, saying that they faked the entire thing so they
    could scam actual hackers.

- en: The group, known as Mogilevich online, says that it did this by telling would-be
    hackers it would sell them the tech used to get into [Epic Games](https://www.thegamer.com/tag/epic-games/).
    Of course, if the hack didn't happen in the first place, then the tech and data
    they sent on would be useless - if they sent any at all. Mogilevich says that
    it sold this material to eight buyers, all without providing proof that they could
    hack a company like Epic.

    Games](https://www.thegamer.com/tag/epic-games/)的技术，来实现这一目标。当然，如果一开始根本没有发生黑客攻击，那么他们发送的技术和数据将毫无用处

- en: This latest development is being reported by [Cyber Daily](https://www.cyberdaily.au/security/10263-epic-games-hacker-mogilevich-admits-it-was-a-scam-operation),
    and comes just days after the "hack" was first reported. Mogilevich claimed to
    have made off with "emails, passwords, full names, payment information, source
    code" from its attack on Epic and was seemingly trying to ransom the data back
    to the company.

  zh: 这一最新进展由[Cyber Daily](https://www.cyberdaily.au/security/10263-epic-games-hacker-mogilevich-admits-it-was-a-scam-operation)报道，就在这次“黑客”首次报道几天后。Mogilevich声称已经从其对Epic的攻击中窃取了“电子邮件、密码、全名、支付信息、源代码”，并似乎试图将数据勒索回公司。
- en: But now, Mogilevich has completely changed its story. We can't verify if the
    group's version of events is true or not, as it's very possible that they did
    pull off a hack and this is all misdirection. However, it does line up with what
    Epic has said on the matter, as it previously told TheGamer that there was "zero
    evidence" that a hack had taken place at all.

  zh: 然而，现在，Mogilevich完全改变了他们的说法。我们无法验证组织版本的事件是否属实，因为他们完全有可能实施了一次黑客攻击，而这一切只是在进行误导。然而，这与Epic此前在此事上的说法一致，该公司此前告诉TheGamer，根本没有任何证据表明发生了黑客攻击。

    are legitimate. Mogilievich has not contacted Epic or provided any proof of the

    you need," says a member of Mogilevich, reportedly speaking on a page that it
    initially claimed would contain material from the Epic hack. "In reality, we are
    not a ransomware-as-a-service, but professional fraudsters."

    gain new contacts to scam. The group says that, in this regard, it all went according
    to plan, as would-be hackers apparently sent over tens of thousands of dollars.
