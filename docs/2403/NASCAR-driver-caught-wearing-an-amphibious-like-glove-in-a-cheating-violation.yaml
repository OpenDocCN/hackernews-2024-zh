- en: LAS VEGAS (AP) — NASCAR on Saturday displayed a clearly altered glove that Joey
    Logano wore in qualifying at Atlanta Motor Speedway, where aerodynamic-deflecting
    alterations were so obvious it looked as if he was wearing part of an amphibious
    costume.

- en: The black glove for Logano’s left hand had webbing made of an unspecified material
    in between every finger. The theory is that Logano, who qualified second at Atlanta
    last weekend, had the glove altered in order to place his hand out his window
    as an aerodynamic blocker during [qualifying](https://apnews.com/article/nascar-atlanta-mcdowell-qualifying-51cd5c3fc350460ff959b71ac51c2761).

    motivation of the two-time Cup champion or Team Penske, which did not appeal a
    penalty imposed on Logano. NASCAR said it discovered the glove during a random
    inspection — and not, as Denny Hamlin suggested, in a tipoff from a rival team
    — and that it did not know if Logano was wearing the glove when he [won the pole
    for the season-opening Daytona 500](https://apnews.com/article/nascar-daytona-500-qualifying-95863156d82cd205a50f55dc93b05af5).

    would have done computer simulation on the glove before using it on the track.
    LaJoie estimated the webbed glove was worth three counts of drag for Logano.

    that we have some speed in our race car and to be able to put it on the pole here,
    to me, is a statement type lap, so I’m proud of that.”

    activity at Las Vegas. “As you can see, the entire glove is webbed. The reason
