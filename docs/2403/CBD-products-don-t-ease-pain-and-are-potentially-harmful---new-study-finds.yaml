    cannabis plant. It’s a popular alternative treatment for pain and is readily available
    in shops and online in the form of oils, tinctures, vapes, topical creams, edibles
    (such as gummy bears) and soft drinks.

    European countries) so long as it contains negligible quantities of THC or none
    at all. However, CBD products sold on the retail market are not covered by trade
    standards, meaning there is no requirement for them to be consistent in content
