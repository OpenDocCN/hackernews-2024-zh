    This behavior only occurs on Windows w/ MSVC. It does not occur with MinGW or
    on other platforms.

    to be documented". Your reaction is surely "it's never a bug, it's always user
    error". I appreciate that sentiment. Please hold that thought for just a minute
    and read on.

    When it deadlocks exactly 1 child successfully acquires a shared lock and all
    other children block forever in `lock_shared()`. This behavior can be observed
    with `std::shared_mutex`, `std::shared_lock`/`std::unique_lock`, or simply calling
    `SRW` functions directly.

- en: If the single child that succeeds calls `unlock_shared()` then the other children
    will wake up. However if we're waiting for all readers to acquire their shared
    lock then we will wait forever. Yes, we could achieve this behavior in other ways,
    that's not the question.

    that has had some good discussion. The behavior has been confirmed. However at
    this point we need a language lawyer, [u/STL](/u/STL), or quite honestly Raymond
    Chen to declare whether this is "by design" or a bug.

- en: Personally I don't think the function `lock_shared()` should ever be allowed
    to block forever when there is not an exclusive lock. That, to me, is a bug. One
    that only appears for `std::shared_mutex` in the `SRW`-based Windows MSVC implementation.
    *Maybe* it's allowed by the language spec? I'm not a language lawyer.

- en: I'm also inclined to call the `SRW` behavior either a bug or something that
    should be documented. There's a [2017 Raymond Chen](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20170301-00/?p=95615)
    post that discusses EXACTLY this behavior. He implies it is user error. Therefore
    I'm inclined to boldly, and perhaps wrongly, call this is an `SRW` bug.
