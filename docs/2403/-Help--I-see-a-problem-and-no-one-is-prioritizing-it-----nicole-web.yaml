- en: What you're doing here is assuming that your manager is aware of the problem
    and giving a high level summary of it, and then explaining the *impact*, which
    is less visible to your manager. The way managers see that impact is often by
    *you* (and your peers) reporting it to them.
  id: totrans-split-21

    by not explaining it again, she won't feel defensive ("ugh, they're explaining
    this again, and obviously I've noticed!") and is in control.

    skill, you'll be able to learn about a bunch of people's perspectives on *lots*
    of things, in or out of work. Curiosity is disarming, and people are more willing
    to share. And then when you understand that perspective, you can *then* either
    try to get the problem fixed, or decide that it doesn't need to be.

    things the same as you are. Sometimes a problem can dig itself under our skin
    and we can't let it go, but it's not bothering other people the same way. Or it
    does bother other people, but they're not showing it.

    if your peers are bothered by the same problem and why or why not. It's sometimes
    easier with peers, because the power dynamic is more balanced.

- en: If you find out your peers aren't bothered by a problem, it's going to be *really*
    hard to get it prioritized unless it's something major and you convince your manager
    to wield her authority unilaterally to force it. That's usually not a good idea
    for a manager to do, so this would be things like "we're violating a major law"
    and not things like "the test suite is 50% too slow."
  id: totrans-split-35

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If your peers *are* bothered by it just like you are, then you now have an advantage
    and something you can work with. You can have your team collectively present the
    arguments to your manager. This way they'll be stronger from multiple perspectives,
    and the manager also has a tougher time saying no to a whole group than to individuals.
    They might still have to say no, if there's business context that means the problem
    isn't solvable, so be prepared!

    or the individual contributor leadership track, you have to hone the skill of
    identifying which problems are important. This goes beyond this specific problem

    it. A bigger part is identifying which problems are *not* important to solve,

    different role entirely like product management or program management, this skill
    is essential. The soft skills you use for it are also critical. Learning how to
    put people at ease enough to tell you information, or learning how to suss it
    out without biasing them toward your existing opinion, is critical to the consensus
    building that you'll need to do in leadership roles.
