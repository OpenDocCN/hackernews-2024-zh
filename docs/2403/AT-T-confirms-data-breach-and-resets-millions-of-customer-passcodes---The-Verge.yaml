    that a data leak making the rounds online contains information from more than
    7.6 million current customers and 65 million former customers. The company has
    reset the security passcodes of active customers affected, and says that leaked
    information "may have included full name, email address, mailing address, phone
    number, social security number, date of birth, AT&T account number and passcode."

    of the leak](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/atandt-denies-data-breach-after-hacker-auctions-70-million-user-database/)
    emerged in 2021 — only came after *TechCrunch* notified AT&T of the vulnerability
    of its encrypted passcodes on Monday. The passcodes are typically four-digit numerical
    PINs used for account security on phone calls with company support or in-store
    verification and a security researcher’s analysis revealed that it was “easy to
    decipher” the passcodes.

    says customers can set up free fraud alerts from credit bureaus Equifax, Experian,
    and TransUnion. According to AT&T, the data set “appears to be from 2019 or earlier
    and does not contain personal financial information or call history.” The company
    says it’s working with “external cybersecurity experts to analyze the situation,”
    and that so far it has no “evidence of authorized access” to its systems.'
