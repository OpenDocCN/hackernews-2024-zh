- en: Oregon Governor Tina Kotek on Tuesday signed Senate Bill 1596 into law, joining
    California, Colorado, Maine, Massachusetts and Minnesota in a growing list of
    states embracing a right to repair for citizens. The law is set to go into effect

- en: The bill’s coauthors Janeen Sollman and Representative Courtney Neron took inspiration
    from California’s Senate Bill 244, which passed toward the tail end of 2023\.
    The lawmakers did, however, add a key provision that split industry representatives.
    Apple, in particular, has taken issue with its aggressive approach to outlawing
    parts pairing, a practice that requires the use of proprietary components in the
    repair process.

    senior manager, Secure System Design, said in testimony to state lawmakers in
    February. “I have met with Senator Sollman several times and appreciate her willingness
    to engage in an open dialogue. Senate Bill 1596 is a step forward in making sure
    that the people of Oregon, myself included, can get their devices repaired easily
    and cost effectively.”

    parts — in particular biometric elements like fingerprint scanners. In a conversation
    with TechCrunch last month, Sollman expressed frustration over attempts to work
    with Apple on crafting the bill.

    the game of operator, like I was being the one that was having to bring forward
    the changes, and not Apple themselves,” she said at the time. “That’s very frustrating.
    We entertained many of the changes that Apple brought forward that are in the
    California bill. There were two remaining items that were concerning to them.
    We’ve addressed one of them, because that was providing some ambiguity to the
    bill. And so, I think the one part that . . . they will stand on the hill on is
    the parts pairing.”

    easier for Oregonians to keep their personal electronics running. That will conserve
    precious natural resources and prevent waste,” OSPIRG (Oregon State Public Interest
    Research Group) director Charlie Fisher noted [in a statement](https://pirg.org/updates/governor-kotek-signs-the-right-to-repair-act-into-law/)
    following the news. “It’s a refreshing alternative to a ‘throwaway’ system that
    treats everything as disposable.”
