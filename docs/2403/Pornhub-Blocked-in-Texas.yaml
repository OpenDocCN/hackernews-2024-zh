- en: Last week, a federal appeals court [upheld a Texas law](https://www.ca5.uscourts.gov/opinions/pub/23/23-50627-CV0.pdf)
    requiring pornography sites to institute age-verification measures to ensure only
    adults 18 and older are able to access them, while it also struck down a part
    of the law requiring porn sites to [display “health warnings”](https://variety.com/2023/digital/news/pornhubs-texas-age-verification-law-violates-first-amendment-ruling-1235709902/)
    about the content. That came after a previous federal judge’s ruling that [the
    Texas law violated the U.S. Constitution’s First Amendment](https://variety.com/2023/digital/news/pornhubs-texas-age-verification-law-violates-first-amendment-ruling-1235709902/) prohibition
    against free-speech restrictions. The Texas Attorney General’s Office immediately
    appealed that decision.

    Pornhub (and other sites operated by parent company [Aylo](https://variety.com/t/aylo/))
    explained that it was disabling access to comply with the law, as first [reported](https://www.houstonchronicle.com/politics/texas/article/pornhub-blocked-texas-age-verification-19021482.php)
    by the Houston Chronicle.

    your age before allowing you access to our website. Not only does this impinge
    on the rights of adults to access protected speech, it fails strict scrutiny by
    employing the least effective and yet also most restrictive means of accomplishing
    Texas’s stated purpose of allegedly protecting minors,” the message reads in part.

    have made the difficult decision to completely disable access to our website in
    Texas. In doing so, we are complying with the law, as we always do, but hope that
    governments around the world will implement laws that actually protect the safety
    and security of users.”

    of our mission, providing identification every time you want to visit an adult
    platform is not an effective solution for protecting users online, and in fact,
    will put minors and your privacy at risk.”

    and asserted that it will drive users “from those few websites which comply, to
    the thousands of websites, with far fewer safety measures in place, which do not
    comply. Very few sites are able to compare to the robust Trust and Safety measures
    we currently have in place. To protect minors and user privacy, any legislation
    must be enforced against all platforms offering adult content.”

- en: The Texas law was signed by Republican Gov. Greg Abbott in June 2023\. The legislation,
    Texas H.B. 11811, was scheduled to go into effect on Sept. 1, but it was on hold
    after the lawsuit filed by the Free Speech Coalition (a group that includes Pornhub’s
    parent company) resulted in a preliminary injunction staying its enforcement.
    The law applies to online publishers whose content is more than one-third “sexual
    material harmful to minors” and requires them to verify the age of all visitors
    using a government-issued ID or “public or private transactional data.”

    of brand and community at Aylo, which said in part: “This is not the end. We are
    reviewing options and consulting with our legal team… We will continue to fight
    for our industry and the performers that legally earn a living, and we will continue
    to appeal through all available judicial recourse to recognize that this law is
    unconstitutional.”'

- en: Keksi also said in the statement that Aylo “has publicly supported age verification
    of users for years, but we believe that any law to this effect must ensure minors
    do not access content intended for adults and preserve user safety and privacy.
    We believe that the real solution for protecting minors and adults alike is to
    verify users’ ages at the point of access — the users’ devices — and to deny or
    permit access to age-restricted materials and websites based on that verification.”

    in at least seven other U.S. states — Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Montana,
    North Carolina, Virginia and Utah — which have adopted similar laws.
