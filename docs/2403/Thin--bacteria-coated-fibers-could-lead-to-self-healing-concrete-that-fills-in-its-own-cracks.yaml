    But what if when concrete cracked, it could heal itself?

    and wear. Over time, these cracks expand, allowing water and corrosive substances
    that weaken the concrete to penetrate further down.

    repair crews. These agents target the wounded area, mending tissues and restoring
    the cells’ functionality. What if concrete had the same kind of [self-healing

    water well. When the concrete cracks, and water from rain, humidity or street

    well as calcium in the concrete itself. With these materials, the bacteria facilitates
    a chemical reaction called microbially induced calcium carbonate precipitation,
    or MICCP. This reaction creates [calcium carbonate crystals](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dibe.2024.100351),
    which build up and fill in the cracks in the concrete.

    gravel and water. We toss the BioFibers into the mix and spread them out as the
    concrete is mixed, ensuring they’re evenly distributed throughout the mixture.

    is done – it can’t heal anymore. But since the concrete has many BioFibers distributed
    throughout, another fiber can mend the next crack. At the moment, we do not know
    how many cracks BioFiber concrete can heal, and we’re conducing more research
    to figure that out.

    the cracks, depending on how many cracks we anticipate them having to fix. When
    the bacteria runs out of food, the process stops. The bacteria can live for roughly
    a couple of weeks during the healing process.

    make manufacturing it at a larger scale challenging. The manufacturing process
    and materials used are specialized and not always affordable and practical. While
    our first tests suggest that BioFiber extends the life span of concrete, we’ll
    need more testing, including field trials, to verify those early results.

    scales, while in the meantime we continue to run tests and study how to improve
    BioFiber’s self-healing abilities. We’d like to one day get these fibers into
    roads and sidewalks to potentially prevent cracking in aging concrete.
