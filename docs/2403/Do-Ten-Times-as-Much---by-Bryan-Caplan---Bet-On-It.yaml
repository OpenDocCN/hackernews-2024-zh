- en: Almost no one learns how to speak a foreign language very well in school. [By
    the numbers](https://www.econlib.org/archives/2012/08/the_degree_and.html), it’s
    tempting to declare, “Learning a foreign language is impossible.” But that’s plainly
    false. Going from zero to fluency is ultra-rare, but I’ve seen it happen.

- en: How does fluency happen? First and foremost, people who attain fluency practice
    a lot more than the typical foreign language student. “A lot” doesn’t mean 10%
    more, 25% more, or even 100% more. People who attain fluency practice about *ten
    times as much* as the typical person who is officially “learning a foreign language.”
    Sure, the *quality* of practice matters, too; immersion is the best method of
    foreign language acquisition. But unless you’re willing to give ten times the
    normal level of effort, fluency is basically a daydream.

    a similar gap in effort. During my eight years in college, I spent many *thousands*
    of hours reading about economics, politics, and philosophy. Since high school,
    I’ve spent over ten thousand hours writing. When young people ask me, “How can
    I be like you?“ my first thought is, again, ***do ten times as much***.

    think the crucial ingredient is. “Why can’t I get ahead in my career? I strive
    to study and emulate my role models.” Great idea; you just need to multiply your
    effort by a factor a ten. “How can I save my marriage? I’m really trying to make
    my spouse happy.” Again, great idea. You just need to multiply your effort by
    a factor of ten.'

    *[The Room](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0368226/characters/nm1393926)*, you may
    object, “Ten times as much? You want ten times as much, Bryan? You know what?
    I haven’t *got* ten times as much!” But my advice is usually far more practical
    than it sounds, because most people who “want to succeed” barely lift a finger
    most of the time. Saying ten times as many kind words to your friends is easy
    in a world whether most people only say two or three such sentences *weekly*.
    Cold emailing ten times as many successful people in your field for advice is
    easy in a world where most people do so once in a lifetime. Never underestimate
    your fellow man’s lack of initiative.

    as “Parenting doesn’t matter.” But that is only one possible interpretation of
    the twin and adoption data. The data is also consistent, however, with the theory
    that most parents are barely trying to get results - at least on many relevant
    margins. I [pondered this in depth](https://www.econlib.org/archives/2015/09/why_im_homescho.html)
    before I started homeschooling my kids. I’m always stunned by all the economists
    who fail to teach their kids about supply-and-demand. All my kids know about these
    holy diagrams. What’s the difference between their kids and mine? I did ten times
    as much.

    some soul-searching. If you want to learn a foreign language, you need to budget
    about two thousand hours. If you want to master a technical subject, you need
    to budget about five thousand hours. If you want your kids to be pious Orthodox
    Jews, move to an Orthodox neighborhood, send them to Orthodox schools, deny them
    internet, and don’t let them make friends with outsiders.

    everything. If you’re not willing to do ten times as much, just level with yourself:
    “I’ve got better things to do than learn a foreign language.” “I’ve got better
    things to do than become a great economist.” “I’ve rather raise my kids in the
    modern world than be a family of earnest Orthodox Jews.” If you take all of the
    time you dabble away in a hundred quixotic ways and concentrate it on two or three
    goals you truly prize, you’ll probably succeed at what you value the most. Pick
    your battles, friends. And wherever do you choose to fight, ***do ten times as
    much.***'
