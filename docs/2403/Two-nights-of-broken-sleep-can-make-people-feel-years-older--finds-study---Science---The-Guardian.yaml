- en: Two nights of broken sleep are enough to make people feel years older, according
    to researchers, who said consistent, restful slumber was a key factor in helping
    to stave off feeling one’s true age.

    years older when they were restricted to only four hours of sleep for two consecutive
    nights, with some claiming the sleepiness made them feel decades older.

    though the effect was more modest, with participants in the study claiming to

    Institute in Stockholm and first author on the study. “Even when you only sleep
    less for two nights that has a real impact on how you feel.”

- en: Beyond simply feeling more decrepit, the perception of being many years older
    may affect people’s health, Balter said, by encouraging unhealthy eating, reducing
    physical exercise, and making people less willing to socialise and engage in new
    experiences.

- en: The researchers ran two studies. In the first, 429 people aged 18 to 70 answered
    questions about how old they felt and on how many nights, if any, they had slept
    badly in the past month. Their sleepiness was also rated according to a standard
    scale used in psychology research.

- en: For each day of poor sleep the volunteers felt on average three months older,
    the scientists found, while those who reported no bad nights in the preceding
    month felt on average nearly six years younger than their true age. It was unclear,
    however, whether bad sleep made people feel older or vice versa.

- en: In the second study, the researchers quizzed 186 volunteers aged 18 to 46 on
    how old they felt after two nights of plentiful sleep, in which they stayed in
    bed for nine hours each night, and two nights when they slept for only four hours
    a night. After two nights of restricted sleep, the participants felt on average
    4.44 years older than when they had ample sleep. Feeling older was linked, unsurprisingly,
    to feeling sleepier.

    the psychologists describe differences in people’s responses to sleep loss depending
    on whether they were a morning person, who woke and went to bed early, or an evening
    person who rose late and retired late. Evening types typically felt older than
    their true age even after plenty of sleep, but morning types were hit harder in
    how old they felt when their sleep was disrupted.

    to realise how malleable subjective age is,” she said. “If we can make people
    feel younger, they may be able to have the associated benefits, such as being
    more willing to take on new experiences and being socially active and physically
    active.”

    involved in the study, called the results “promising”, but said investigating

    these mechanisms over time,” she added. “This study tells us that a bad night
    of sleep can impact how we feel the day after, but what are the cumulative effects
    of bad sleep for months and years?”

    on health,” she said. “The effects of poor diet and low physical activity take
