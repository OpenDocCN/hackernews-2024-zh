    Dwight D. Eisenhower gave one of the [most consequential speeches in American
    history](https://www.gilderlehrman.org/sites/default/files/inline-pdfs/Eisenhower%20Farewell%20Address%20abridged_0.pdf).
    Eisenhower for eight years had been a popular president, whose appeal drew upon
    a reputation as a person of great personal fortitude, who’d guided the United
    States to victory in an existential fight for survival in World War II. Nonetheless,
    as he prepared to vacate the Oval Office for handsome young John F. Kennedy, he
    warned the country it was now at the mercy of a power even he could not overcome.

    it did, and this new sector, Eisenhower said, was building up around itself a
    cultural, financial, and political support system accruing enormous power. This
    “conjunction of an immense military establishment and a large arms industry is
    new in the American experience,” he said, adding:'

    incidents involving figures like Alex Jones and Milo Yiannopoulos, government
    agencies had already long been advancing a new theory of international conflict,
    in which the informational landscape is more importantly understood as a battlefield
    than a forum for exchanging ideas. In this view, “spammy” ads, “junk” news, and
    the sharing of work from “[disinformation agents](https://www.disinformationindex.com/files/gdi_adversnar_report_screen_aw2.pdf)”
    like Jones aren’t inevitable features of a free Internet, but sorties in a new
    form of conflict called “hybrid warfare.”

    U.S. Army published “[Field Manual 100-6](file:///Users/owner/Downloads/437397.pdf),”
    which spoke of “an expanding information domain termed the Global Information
    Environment” that contains “information processes and systems that are beyond
    the direct influence of the military.” Military commanders needed to understand
    that “information dominance” in the “GIE” would henceforth be a crucial element
    for “operating effectively.”

    journalism organization, self-styled as an “Intelligence Agency for the People.”
    It was founded by former Atlantic Council DFRLabs fellow, Eliot Higgins. In the

    former intelligence and government officials. For instance, multiple contributors
    work at the Center for Information Resilience, a counter-disinformation non-profit
    with former “disinformation czar” Nina Jankowicz as their vice president. To add
    to its spook persona, the journalism collective receives funding from the National
    Endowment for Democracy (NED), a shadowy organization called the “sugar daddy
    of overt operations” by the *[Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/opinions/1991/09/22/innocence-abroad-the-new-world-of-spyless-coups/92bb989a-de6e-4bb8-99b9-462c76b59a16/)*,
    doing “openly what had once been unspeakably covert – dispensing money to anti-communist
    forces behind the Iron Curtain.” Bellingcat was named in a proposed consortium
    of counter-disinformation NGOs — including the Atlantic Council’s DFRLabs — called
    the EXPOSE Network, organized by the Zinc Network under the UK’s Counter Disinformation
    and Media Development Programme. This revelation was included in the 2018 release

    In 1953 the United States Information Agency was founded, “to inform others about
    American life…and… [eliminate misperception](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/GOVMAN-1996-05-31/pdf/GOVMAN-1996-05-31-Pg686.pdf).”
    Through 1999, when it was [folded into the State Department](https://1997-2001.state.gov/outreach/publicaffdip/fs_990930_merger.html),
    the USIA was the open messaging arm of the United States government, and had credibility
    precisely because it was undisguised in its function. Today, the USIA’s functions
    are submerged in the Global Engagement Center (with no public-facing messaging)
    and the programs of the expanding U.S. Agency for Global Media (USAGM) empire,
    whose overall budget has [grown](https://www.usaspending.gov/agency/us-agency-for-global-media?fy=2023)
    past $1 billion. That includes [Voice of America](https://www.voanews.com/), an
    early effort at “counter-disinformation” known for broadcasting in German during
    World War II, and [Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty](https://www.rferl.org/), which
    gained renown in the Cold War by broadcasting Western news into Soviet territories.
    These well-known “counter-disinfo” titles in 2016 paired to add a seemingly redundant
    fact-checking wing in [Polygraph.info](https://www.polygraph.info/), which also
    has a Russian-language counterpart, [Factograph](https://www.factograph.info/).
    Ostensibly dedicated to countering “misleading statements and stories from Russian
    officials and state-sponsored propaganda,” Polygraph in reality often “checks”
    domestic actors [like Robert F. Kennedy, Jr](https://www.polygraph.info/a/robert-f-kennedy-jr-is-wrong-there-are-no-us-aegis-missile-systems-in-ukraine/7085833.html),
    [Scott Ritter](https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-ukraine-misinformation-from-ex-un-weapons-inspector-in-russian-propaganda-/7064239.html),
    and [Monica Crowley](https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-no-zelenskyy-did-not-say-american-sons-and-daughters-will-have-to-die-in-ukraine/6986873.html),
    while labeling insufficiently hawkish Americans like Glenn Greenwald supporters
    of Russia. Polygraph for example might “check” Julian Assange’s status as a free-speech
    icon, [quoting](https://www.polygraph.info/a/assange-russia-press-freedom/6742131.html)
    a Center for European Policy Analysis analyst to call the Wikileaks founder “a
    criminal, traitor and propaganda outlet for the people he works with or for.”
    Polygraph in sum is a sadly perfect model for a modern “anti-disinformation” operation,
    posing as independent, non-partisan news aimed at “foreign” disinformation, while
    in reality serving as blunt state propaganda that too often targets domestic political
    opinion.*

    that was influential in getting not-yet-convicted people accused of participation
    in the January 6th protests removed from a variety of Internet services. The ISD

    by NBC reporter Brandy Zadrozny about “how big tech can be as trusted as Wikipedia.”
    The thrust of the report was that Wikipedia had refused a request by the Turkish
    government to take down “two pages that they did not appreciate references to
    President Erdogan and his family and their involvement in the Syrian civil war
    as a state sponsor of terrorism,” which led to a ban of the site that was [overturned

    in 2020\. Wikipedia, like many tech behemoths, plays the role of a defender of
    free speech in certain circumstances, but lately it has become perhaps the most
    furious grindstone of digital conformity in Western media outside Twitter, Google,
    and Facebook, institutionalizing a system of blockages that increasingly only
    let through information reported on in an approving way by large corporate or
    academic institutions (it has been a great [struggle](https://www.foxnews.com/media/elon-musk-slams-wikipedia-considering-deletion-twitter-files-entry-non-trivial-left-wing-bias)
    to get Twitter Files material on the site, for instance). Wikipedia was once seen
    as one of the great experiments in open-source media, and identified with legal
    challenges to things like the NSA’s illegal domestic surveillance program, but
    has become just another member of the cartel-like “industry call” that includes
    the FBI, Twitter, and Facebook (the Twitter Files show the exact moment in which
    Wikipedia asks for a “disinformation” contact at the FBI), and has taken rigid
    stands on ridiculous issues like [the definition of “recession](https://thehill.com/homenews/media/3585404-wikipedia-launching-new-restrictions-for-users-editing-recession-page/).”
