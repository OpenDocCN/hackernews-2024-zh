    going up too fast](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2024/01/28/your-pay-is-still-going-up-too-fast)”
    in the context of recent inflation dynamics. The problem – economics research
    has repeatedly shown that this is not the case. Pay and wages are not the cause
    of increasing inflation.

    wages cause a higher rate of inflation. We have covered this topic extensively
    on Nominal News – from an [economic theory perspective](https://www.nominalnews.com/p/wages-and-inflation),
    and have shown that wages have not caused or continued the inflationary surge
    observed in 2021 to 2023.  Empirical research has shown that wage increases have
    not caused inflationary spikes in the US. Quite the opposite – there is evidence
    that it is elevated inflation that causes wage increases.

    experienced. The charts above show how the four macroeconomic variables behaved
    after the start of the inflationary surge (quarter zero) relative to the values
    of these variables in quarter zero. To follow one such historic inflationary surge,
    let’s look at the red line, which represents the inflationary episode of the 1970s
    and 80s, famously ended by Federal Reserve Chairman [Paul Volcker who raised interest
    rates to 20%](https://www.npr.org/2022/09/29/1125462240/inflation-1970s-volcker-nixon-carter-interest-rates-fed).
    In that period, during 1979, in quarter zero (i.e. April-June, 1979) inflation
    was at 10.8% and it peaked in April 1980 at 14.4% (peaking 3 quarters after June
    1979 and 4% higher than in quarter zero – April-June 1979) and fell to 6.4% around
    two years later in 1982\. In the fourth chart, we can see that real wage growth
    fell in 1979 and 1980 and only started to increase in the latter part of 1980
    (4 quarters after quarter zero), as inflation (in the top left chart) was decreasing.

- en: Looking at the whole chart, the light blue area in each chart shows the outcome
    of the 4 variables for the middle 80% of similar historic inflationary episodes.
    The bottom right chart shows that real wage growth typically remained ‘elevated’
    on average for 3 years, even after inflation fell, as the shaded area is above
    the 0% value. This happened because wages took time to catch up for the lost purchasing
    power. At the same time, in the top left chart, inflation does not re-accelerate
    as real wage growth is elevated. Nominal wage growth (bottom left), which is real
    wage growth plus inflation, follows a flat/slightly downward growth pattern since
    inflation is falling while real wage growth is slightly increasing.

    past 6 months), it is necessary for workers to take a pay cut. As they put it

    if we reduce the costs of labor in the production process, firms won’t have to
    increase prices as much, and thus the rate of inflation would fall. It is true
    that if real wages were to fall, the inflation rate would drop. That is one of
    the key ways increasing interest rates by central banks works to bring down inflation.
    With higher interest rates, businesses find it costlier to open and expand, reducing
    labor demand, increasing unemployment, reducing worker’s bargaining positions
    and thus resulting in lower wages.

    non-wage specific factors (the current inflationary surge was driven predominantly
    by supply shocks) by lowering real wages *will*, by definition, wreck people’s
    livelihoods. By forcing workers to have lower real wages, they will be worse off.
    Placing the entire onus of bringing down inflation on wages is a recipe for an
    unnecessary economic downturn.

    have already taken a ‘pay cut’ – real wages have fallen for higher income individuals
    since the start of the pandemic. Average real wage growth over the period from
    March 2020 has just matched inflation, as average wages [grew by 20%](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CES0500000003)

    wage growth of 3% is driven 2% by inflation and 1% by productivity). It is understating
    the long run average productivity which has actually been between [1.4% to 2.1%](https://www.bls.gov/productivity/),
    thus wages can comfortably grow by 3.4% to 4% a year with 2% inflation.

    wages are adjusted each year at least by the rate of inflation) can make inflation
    more persistent. By definition, inflation-indexed wages cannot result in a higher
    inflation rate. Wages indexed only to inflation will actually reduce the inflation
    rate, if productivity is positive, which it typically is. That is because to maintain
    a fixed inflation rate, wages would need to go up by inflation + productivity
    growth, as discussed above.

- en: The Economist piece appears to have repeated the old theory that wage growth
    causes inflation spirals. As discussed, empirical evidence shows this is not true.
    The Economist article did not cite any relevant academic research in its discussion
    to back this claim, relying on simply repeating the wage-inflation spiral theory.
    The main concern is that the article does not openly state this assumption and
    does not alert readers that this is just a theory. The article makes it seem like
    wage-inflation spirals are natural and occur often, when in reality, we haven’t
    really observed one in the US.

    was significantly higher than the current observed rates. If nominal wage growth
    was well above 7-8% and not the current 4-5%, then there would be a reason to
    start talking about wages in the context of inflation. Until then, wages do not
    convey much meaningful information about where inflation is going that our standard
    inflation measures do not capture already.
