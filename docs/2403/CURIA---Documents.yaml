    as regards the absence of an overriding public interest, within the meaning of
    the last clause of Article 4(2) of that regulation, and infringed the obligation
    to state reasons, since it had considered that no overriding public interest,
    within the meaning of that provision, justified the disclosure of the requested
    harmonised standards and it had failed to give sufficient reasons for its refusal
    to recognise the existence of such an overriding public interest.</p><p class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><a
    name="point25" id="point25">25</a>      In response to the first plea, the General
    Court, after noting, in paragraph 29 of the judgment under appeal, that the purpose
    of Regulation No 1049/2001 is to give the public the widest possible right of
    access to EU institutions’ documents and that, in accordance with Article 2(3)
    of that regulation, that right covers both documents drawn up by those institutions
    and documents received from third parties, which include any legal person, held,
    in paragraphs 30 and 31 of that judgment, that that right is subject to certain
    limits based on public or private interest grounds.</p><p class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><a
    name="point26" id="point26">26</a>      In the first place, as regards the possible
    harm to the protection of commercial interests deriving from copyright in the
    requested harmonised standards, and the eligibility of those harmonised standards
    for copyright protection even though they form part of EU law, the General Court,
    in paragraphs 40 to 43 of the judgment under appeal, held, in substance, that
    it was for the authority in receipt of a request for access to third-party documents
    to identify objective and consistent evidence capable of confirming the existence
    of the copyright claimed by the third party concerned.</p><p class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><a
    name="point27" id="point27">27</a>      In that regard, the General Court held,
    in paragraphs 47 and 48 of the judgment under appeal, that the Commission was
    entitled, without committing any error, to find that the threshold of originality
    to constitute a ‘work’, for the purposes of the case-law, and accordingly to be
    eligible for that protection, had been met in the case at hand so far as concerns
    the harmonised standards in question.</p><p class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><a name="point28"
    id="point28">28</a>      In addition, the General Court found, in paragraph 54
    of the judgment under appeal, that the appellants were wrong to claim that, since
    the Court of Justice had held, in the judgment of 27 October 2016, <i>James Elliott
    Construction</i> (C‑613/14, EU:C:2016:821), that those standards formed part of
    ‘EU law’, they should be freely accessible without charge with the result that
    no exception to the right of access can be applied to them.</p><p class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><a
    name="point29" id="point29">29</a>      In the second place, so far as concerns
    the argument alleging the lack of copyright protection for the requested harmonised
    standards, in the absence of ‘personal intellectual creation’, for the purposes
    of the case-law of the Court of Justice, which is necessary in order to benefit
    from such protection, the General Court held, in essence, in paragraph 59 of the
    judgment under appeal, that that argument was not sufficiently substantiated.</p><p
    class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><a name="point30" id="point30">30</a>      In the
    third place, as regards the existence of an error of assessment as to whether
    protected commercial interests had been undermined, the General Court pointed
    out, in paragraphs 65 and 66 of the judgment under appeal, that the sale of standards
    is a vital part of the standardisation bodies’ business model. To the extent that
    the Commission was justified in finding that the requested harmonised standards
    were covered by copyright protection, under which they were accessible to interested
    parties solely after the payment of certain fees, their disclosure for free on
    the basis of Regulation No 1049/2001 was such as to specifically and actually
    affect the commercial interests of CEN and its national members. The General Court
    added, in paragraph 71 of that judgment, that the fact that the European standardisation
    organisations contributed to the performance of tasks in the public interest by
    providing certification services relating to compliance with the applicable legislation
    did not alter in any way their status as private entities engaged in an economic
    activity.</p><p class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><a name="point31" id="point31">31</a>      Accordingly,
    the General Court rejected, in paragraph 74 of the judgment under appeal, the
    first plea in its entirety.</p><p class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><a name="point32"
    id="point32">32</a>      The appellants’ second plea was divided into three parts.</p><p
    class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><a name="point33" id="point33">33</a>      Concerning
    the third part of that plea, alleging an inadequate statement of reasons for the
    Commission’s refusal to recognise the existence of an overriding public interest,
    the General Court noted, first of all, in paragraph 86 of the judgment under appeal,
    that, in the decision at issue, the Commission had stated that the judgment of
    27 October 2016, <i>James Elliott Construction</i> (C‑613/14, EU:C:2016:821),
    did not create an obligation of proactive publication of the harmonised standards
    in the <i>Official Journal of the European Union</i>, nor did it establish an
    automatic overriding public interest in their disclosure. Next, in paragraphs 87
    and 88 of the judgment under appeal, the General Court also noted that the Commission
    had rebutted the appellants’ claims related to the obligations of transparency
    in environmental matters, deemed to be in the overriding public interest, compared
    with the interest in protecting the commercial interests of a natural or legal
    person, and that the Commission had added that it had not been able to identify
    any overriding public interest justifying such disclosure. Lastly, in paragraph 91
    of the judgment under appeal, the General Court added that, even though the Commission
    was required to set out the reasons justifying the application to the particular
    case of one of the exceptions to the right of access provided for by Regulation
    No 1049/2001, it was not however required to provide more information than was
    necessary in order for the person requesting access to understand the reasons
    for its decision and for the Court to review the legality of that decision.</p><p
    class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><a name="point34" id="point34">34</a>      As for
    the existence of an overriding public interest requiring free access to the law,
    the General Court found, first, in paragraphs 99 to 101 of the judgment under
    appeal, that, in the case at hand, the appellants were seeking to remove entirely
    the category of harmonised standards from the scope of application of the system
    of substantive exceptions established by Regulation No 1049/2001, without however
    substantiating the specific grounds which would have justified the disclosure
    of the requested harmonised standards or explaining to what extent the disclosure
    of those standards ought to have prevailed over the protection of the commercial
    interests of CEN or its national members.</p><p class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><a
    name="point35" id="point35">35</a>      Second, the public interest in ensuring
    the proper functioning of the European standardisation system, the aim of which
    is to promote the free movement of goods while guaranteeing an equivalent minimum
    level of safety in all European countries, prevails over the guarantee of freely
    available access to the harmonised standards without charge.</p><p class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><a
    name="point36" id="point36">36</a>      Third, Regulation No 1025/2012 expressly
    provides for a system of publication which is limited to the references of harmonised
    standards and allows for paid access to those standards for those wishing to benefit
    from the presumption of conformity attached to them.</p><p class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><a
    name="point37" id="point37">37</a>      Fourth, the General Court held, in paragraphs 104
    and 105 of the judgment under appeal, that the Commission had not erred in finding,
    in the decision at issue, that there was no overriding public interest justifying
    the disclosure of the requested harmonised standards under the last clause of
    Article 4(2) of Regulation No 1049/2001\. The General Court added, in paragraph 107
    of that judgment that, apart from the fact that the appellants did not state the
    exact source of a ‘constitutional principle’ which would require access that is
    freely available and free of charge to harmonised standards, they did not in any
    way explain the reason why those standards should be subject to the requirement
    of publication and accessibility attached to a ‘law’, inasmuch as those standards
    are not mandatory, they produce the legal effects attached to them solely with
    regard to the persons concerned, and they may be consulted for free in certain
    libraries in the Member States.</p><p class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><a name="point38"
    id="point38">38</a>      So far as concerns the existence of an overriding public
    interest arising from the obligation of transparency in environmental matters,
    the General Court found, in paragraph 119 of the judgment under appeal, that both
    the Convention on Access to Information, Public Participation in Decision-Making
    and Access to Justice in Environmental Matters, signed in Aarhus on 25 June 1998
    and approved on behalf of the European Community by Council Decision 2005/370/EC
    of 17 February 2005 (OJ 2005 L 124, p. 1) and Regulation No 1367/2006 provide
    for public access to environmental information either on request or as part of
    active dissemination by the authorities and institutions concerned. However, since
    those authorities and institutions may refuse a request for access to information
    where that information falls within the scope of a number of exceptions, they
    are under no obligation actively to disseminate that information.</p><p class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><a
    name="point39" id="point39">39</a>      The General Court inferred therefrom,
    in paragraph 129 of that judgment, that the requested harmonised standards did
    not come within the sphere of information which relates to emissions into the
    environment and could not therefore benefit from the application of the presumption
    laid down in the first sentence of Article 6(1) of that regulation, according
    to which the disclosure of standards of that nature is deemed to be in the overriding
    public interest within the meaning of Article 4(2) of Regulation No 1049/2001.</p><p
    class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><a name="point40" id="point40">40</a>      Consequently,
    in paragraph 130 of the judgment under appeal, the General Court rejected the
    second plea in its entirety, and dismissed the action.</p><p class="C04Titre1"> <b>Forms
    of order sought by the parties to the appeal</b></p><p class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><a
    name="point41" id="point41">41</a>      By their appeal, the appellants claim

    class="C03Tiretlong">–        in the alternative, refer the matter back to the

    the oral part of the procedure to be reopened</b></p><p class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><a
    name="point43" id="point43">43</a>      By a document lodged at the Registry of
    the Court of Justice on 17 August 2023, the interveners at first instance requested
    that the oral part of the procedure be reopened, in accordance with Article 83
    of the Rules of Procedure of the Court of Justice.</p><p class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><a
    name="point44" id="point44">44</a>      In support of their application, they
    submit that the Advocate General’s Opinion, delivered on 22 June 2023, is based
    on numerous assumptions which are factually unsubstantiated, or even erroneous,
    which would require, at the very least, a more thorough discussion. In addition,
    they consider that an in-depth debate is all the more necessary since the Advocate
    General relied on incorrect assumptions and the approach which she adopted in
    her Opinion, in particular that according to which ‘the EU standardisation system
    does not actually require paid access to [harmonised technical standards]’, creates
    a risk for the functioning of that system.</p><p class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><a
    name="point45" id="point45">45</a>      Pursuant to Article 83 of its Rules of
    Procedure, the Court may at any time, after hearing the Advocate General, order
    the reopening of the oral part of the procedure, in particular if it considers
    that it lacks sufficient information or where a party has, after the close of
    that part of the procedure, submitted a new fact which is of such a nature as
    to have a decisive bearing on the decision of the Court, or where the case must
    be decided on the basis of an argument which has not been debated between the
    parties or the interested persons referred to in Article 23 of the Statute of
    the Court of Justice of the European Union.</p><p class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><a
    name="point46" id="point46">46</a>      That is not the situation here. The interveners
    at first instance and the Commission set out, at the hearing, their assessment
    of the factual context of the dispute. In particular, they had the opportunity
    to express their views on the presentation of the facts as set out in the judgment
    under appeal and the appeal, and to specify the reasons why, in their view, the
    European standardisation system requires paid access to the requested harmonised
    standards. Accordingly, the Court considers, after hearing the Advocate General,
    that it has before it all the information necessary to give judgment.</p><p class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><a
    name="point47" id="point47">47</a>      Furthermore, as regards the claim that
    the Advocate General’s Opinion contains guidelines posing a risk to the functioning
    of the European standardisation system, it must be borne in mind that the Statute
    of the Court of Justice of the European Union and the Rules of Procedure make
    no provision for interested parties to submit observations in response to the
    Advocate General’s Opinion (judgment of 25 October 2017, <i>Polbud – Wykonawstwo</i>,
    C‑106/16, EU:C:2017:804, paragraph 23 and the case-law cited).</p><p class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><a
    name="point48" id="point48">48</a>      Under the second paragraph of Article 252
    TFEU, it is the duty of the Advocate General, acting with complete impartiality
    and independence, to make, in open court, reasoned submissions on cases which,
    in accordance with the Statute of the Court of Justice of the European Union,
    require the Advocate General’s involvement. In this regard, the Court is not bound
    either by the conclusion reached by the Advocate General or by the reasoning which
    led to that conclusion. Consequently, a party’s disagreement with the Opinion
    of the Advocate General, irrespective of the questions that he or she examines
    in his or her Opinion, cannot in itself constitute grounds justifying the reopening
    of the oral part of the procedure (judgment of 4 September 2014, <i>Vnuk</i>,
    C‑162/13, EU:C:2014:2146, paragraph 31 and the case-law cited).</p><p class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><a
    name="point49" id="point49">49</a>      In the light of the foregoing, the Court
    considers that there is no need to reopen the oral part of the procedure.</p><p
    class="C04Titre1"> <b>The appeal</b></p><p class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><a name="point50"
    id="point50">50</a>      The appellants put forward two grounds in support of
    their appeal. The first ground of appeal alleges that the General Court erred
    in law in holding that the requested harmonised standards fall within the exception
    provided for in the first indent of Article 4(2) of Regulation No 1049/2001, which
    seeks to protect the commercial interests of a natural or legal person, including
    intellectual property. The second ground alleges an error of law as regards the
    existence of an overriding public interest, within the meaning of the last clause
    of Article 4(2) of that regulation, justifying the disclosure of those standards.</p><p
    class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><a name="point51" id="point51">51</a>      It is
    appropriate to begin by examining the second ground of appeal.</p><p class="C05Titre2"> <i><b>Arguments
    of the parties</b></i></p><p class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><a name="point52" id="point52">52</a>      By
    their second ground of appeal, the appellants claim that the General Court erred
    in law in holding that there was no overriding public interest, within the meaning
    of the last clause of Article 4(2) of Regulation No 1049/2001, justifying the
    disclosure of the requested harmonised standards.</p><p class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><a
    name="point53" id="point53">53</a>      In the first place, the appellants criticise,
    in substance, the General Court for holding, in paragraphs 98 to 101 of the judgment
    under appeal, that they had not demonstrated the specific reasons justifying their
    request for access, based on the existence of an overriding public interest in
    disclosure of the requested harmonised standards.</p><p class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><a
    name="point54" id="point54">54</a>      In that regard, they claim, first of all,
    that the requested harmonised standards form part of EU law, which must be freely
    available. Next, they maintain that those standards concern fundamental issues
    for consumers, namely, the safety of toys. Lastly, they argue that such standards
    are also very important for manufacturers and all other participants in the supply
    chain, since there is a presumption of conformity with EU legislation, applicable
    to the products concerned when the requirements laid down in those standards are
    met.</p><p class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><a name="point55" id="point55">55</a>      In
    the second place, the appellants complain that the General Court erred in law,
    in paragraphs 102 and 103 of the judgment under appeal, in finding that the public
    interest in ensuring the functioning of the European standardisation system prevails
    over the guarantee of freely available access to the harmonised standards without
    charge.</p><p class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><a name="point56" id="point56">56</a>      Furthermore,
    according to the appellants, the functioning of the European standardisation system
    is not covered by the exception laid down in the first indent of Article 4(2)
    of Regulation No 1049/2001, which concerns only the protection of the commercial
    interests of a natural or legal person, including intellectual property. By considering
    that the public interest in ensuring the functioning of the European standardisation
    system falls within the scope of that provision, the General Court wrongly created
    an exception, which is not provided for in that regulation.</p><p class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><a
    name="point57" id="point57">57</a>      In the third place, the appellants complain
    that the General Court erred in law, in paragraphs 104 and 105 of the judgment
    under appeal, by endorsing the Commission’s assessment according to which the
    judgment of 27 October 2016, <i>James Elliott Construction</i> (C‑613/14, EU:C:2016:821),
    does not create an obligation of proactive publication of the harmonised standards
    in the <i>Official Journal of the European Union </i>or establish an automatic
    overriding public interest in their disclosure.</p><p class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><a
    name="point58" id="point58">58</a>      In that regard, the requested harmonised
    standards should be considered to be legislative documents since the procedure
    for their adoption constitutes a form of ‘controlled’ legislative delegation.
    In particular, references to such standards are published in the <i>Official Journal
    of the European Union</i> and the Commission requires Member States to adopt each
    harmonised standard as a national standard without amendment, within six months.
    Furthermore, publication in the <i>Official Journal of the European Union</i>
    has the effect of conferring on products which are covered by EU legislation and
    satisfy the technical requirements defined in the harmonised standards the benefit
    of a presumption of conformity with EU legislation.</p><p class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><a
    name="point59" id="point59">59</a>      In the fourth place, the appellants claim
    that the General Court erred in law, in paragraph 107 of the judgment under appeal,
    when it stated that harmonised standards produce the legal effects attached to
    them solely with regard to the persons concerned. That conclusion runs counter
    to the case-law of the Court of Justice according to which harmonised standards
    form part of EU law.</p><p class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><a name="point60" id="point60">60</a>      The
    Commission, supported by the interveners at first instance, contends, as a preliminary
    point, that the appellants’ line of argument is so general that it could apply
    to any request for disclosure relating to a harmonised standard.</p><p class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><a
    name="point61" id="point61">61</a>      As regards the reasons specifically relied
    on by the appellants, the Commission observes, first, that, although it considers
    that the requested harmonised standards do indeed form part of EU law, that does
    not mean that they must be freely available. Second, as for the fact that those
    standards relate to issues that are fundamental to consumers, it observes that
    that argument is too general to take precedence over the reasons justifying the
    refusal to disclose the documents at issue. Third, the interest in harmonised
    standards that manufacturers and other participants in the supply chain have in
    order to gain access to the internal market cannot be regarded as an overriding
    public interest justifying the disclosure of those standards.</p><p class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><a
    name="point62" id="point62">62</a>      In addition, it submits that freely available
    access to the harmonised standards without charge would have systemic effects
    on the interveners at first instance, their intellectual property rights and their
    commercial income. In this respect, the European standardisation system cannot
    operate without paid access to those standards, with the result that the exception
    provided for in Article 4(2) of Regulation No 1049/2001 is applicable. In any
    event, there is no overriding public interest justifying the disclosure of those
    standards.</p><p class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><a name="point63" id="point63">63</a>      Finally,
    the Commission states that harmonised standards are not drafted in the course
    of legislative procedures, but on the basis of a mandate given by the Commission
    to a standardisation body following the adoption of a legislative act. Moreover,
    once adopted by a standardisation body, harmonised standards must be transposed
    into the national legal systems by the national members of that body, and in accordance
    with the internal procedural rules of that body. In any event, the direct access
    provided for in Article 12(2) of Regulation No 1049/2001 is also subject to the
    exception laid down in the first indent of Article 4(2) of that regulation.</p><p
    class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><a name="point64" id="point64">64</a>      Consequently,
    the Commission considers that the second ground of appeal should be rejected.</p><p
    class="C06Titre3"> <i>Findings of the Court</i></p><p class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><a
    name="point65" id="point65">65</a>      By their second ground of appeal, the
    appellants submit, in substance, that the General Court erred in law in holding
    that no overriding public interest, within the meaning of the last clause of Article 4(2)
    of Regulation No 1049/2001, justified disclosure of the requested harmonised standards.
    In their view, there is, by virtue of the principle of the rule of law, which
    requires free access to EU law, an overriding public interest justifying access
    to those standards for all natural or legal persons residing or having their registered
    office in a Member State, on the ground that those rules form part of EU law.</p><p
    class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><a name="point66" id="point66">66</a>      As a preliminary
    point, it should be recalled that the right of access to documents of the institutions,
    bodies, offices and agencies of the Union, whatever their medium, is guaranteed
    to any citizen of the Union, and to any natural or legal person residing or having
    its registered office in a Member State, by Article 15(3) TFEU and by Article 42
    of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union (‘the Charter’). The
    exercise of that right is, as regards access to Parliament, Council and Commission
    documents, governed by Regulation No 1049/2001, the purpose of which, according
    to Article 1 thereof, is, inter alia, to ‘define the principles, conditions and
    limits’ of that right, ‘in such a way as to ensure the widest possible access
    to documents’ and to ‘establish rules ensuring the easiest possible exercise of
    [that] right’.</p><p class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><a name="point67" id="point67">67</a>      Article 2(1)
    of that regulation specifically provides for a right of access to documents of
    the Parliament, Council and Commission. Under Article 2(2) of that regulation,
    the institutions may, subject to those principles, conditions and limits, grant
    access to documents to any natural or legal person not residing or not having
    its registered office in a Member State.</p><p class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><a
    name="point68" id="point68">68</a>      According to the first indent and the
    final clause of Article 4(2) of Regulation No 1049/2001, those institutions are
    to refuse access to a document where its disclosure would undermine the protection
    of commercial interests of a natural or legal person, including intellectual property,
    unless there is an overriding public interest in disclosure.</p><p class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><a
    name="point69" id="point69">69</a>      It is thus apparent from the wording of
    that provision that the exception provided for therein is not applicable where
    there is an overriding public interest in disclosure of the document concerned.</p><p
    class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><a name="point70" id="point70">70</a>      In that
    regard, it should, in the first place, be recalled that the Court has already
    held that a harmonised standard, adopted on the basis of a directive and the references
    to which have been published in the <i>Official Journal of the European Union</i>,
    forms part of EU law owing to its legal effects (see, to that effect, judgment
    of 27 October 2016, <i>James Elliott Construction</i>, C‑613/14, EU:C:2016:821,
    paragraph 40).</p><p class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><a name="point71" id="point71">71</a>      In
    particular, first, the Court has already held that harmonised standards may be
    binding on the public generally as long as they themselves have been published
    in the <i>Official Journal of the European Union</i> (see, to that effect, judgment
    of 22 February 2022, <i>Stichting Rookpreventie Jeugd and Others</i>, C‑160/20,
    EU:C:2022:101, paragraph 48).</p><p class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><a name="point72"
    id="point72">72</a>      Second, as regards the procedure for drawing up harmonised
    standards, it should be noted that that procedure was laid down by the EU legislature
    in Regulation No 1025/2012 and that, in accordance with the provisions set out
    in Chapter III of that regulation, the Commission plays a central role in the
    European standardisation system.</p><p class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><a name="point73"
    id="point73">73</a>      Thus, it should be noted, as the Advocate General did
    in points 23 to 31 of her Opinion, that even if the development of those standards
    is entrusted to a body governed by private law, only the Commission is empowered
    to request that a harmonised standard be developed in order to implement a directive
    or a regulation. Under the last sentence of Article 10(1) of Regulation No 1025/2012,
    the Commission determines the requirements as to the content to be met by the
    requested harmonised standard and a deadline for its adoption. That development
    process is supervised by the Commission, which also provides financing in accordance
    with Article 15 of that regulation. In accordance with Article 11(1)(a) of that
    regulation, it is to decide to publish, not to publish or to publish with restriction
    the references to the harmonised standard concerned in the<i> Official Journal
    of the European Union</i>.</p><p class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><a name="point74"
    id="point74">74</a>      Third, although Regulation No 1025/2012 provides, in
    Article 2(1) thereof, that compliance with harmonised standards is not compulsory,
    products which comply with those standards benefit, as is apparent from recital 5
    of that regulation, from a presumption of conformity with the essential requirements
    relating to them laid down in the relevant EU harmonisation legislation. That
    legal effect, conferred by that legislation, is one of the essential characteristics
    of those standards and makes them an essential tool for economic operators, for
    the purposes of exercising the right to free movement of goods or services on
    the EU market.</p><p class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><a name="point75" id="point75">75</a>      More
    specifically, it may prove difficult, or even impossible, for economic operators
    to have recourse to a procedure other than that of compliance with such standards,
    such as an individual expert report, in the light of the administrative difficulties
    and additional costs arising therefrom (see, to that effect, judgment of 12 July
    2012, <i>Fra.bo</i>, C‑171/11, EU:C:2012:453, paragraphs 29 and 30)</p><p class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><a
    name="point76" id="point76">76</a>      Consequently, as the Advocate General
    observed in point 43 of her Opinion, where EU legislation provides that compliance
    with a harmonised standard gives rise to a presumption of conformity with the
    essential requirements of that legislation, that means that any natural or legal
    person who wishes effectively to challenge that presumption in respect of a given
    product or service must demonstrate that that product or service does not meet
    that standard or, alternatively, that that standard is not fit for purpose.</p><p
    class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><a name="point77" id="point77">77</a>      In the
    present case, three of the four requested harmonised standards, namely, standard
    EN 71-5:2015, entitled ‘Safety of toys – Part 5: Chemical toys (sets) other than
    experimental sets’, standard EN 71‑4:2013, entitled ‘Safety of toys – Part 4:
    Experimental sets for chemistry and related activities’ and standard EN 71‑12:2013,
    entitled ‘Safety of toys – Part 12: N-Nitrosamines and N-nitrosatable substances’
    refer to Directive 2009/48\. Their references were published in the <i>Official
    Journal of the European Union</i> of 13 November 2015 (OJ 2015 C 378, p. 1). In
    accordance with Article 13 of that directive, toys which have been manufactured
    in compliance with those standards enjoy a presumption of conformity with the
    requirements covered by those standards.</p><p class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><a
    name="point78" id="point78">78</a>      As for standard EN 12472:2005+A 1:2009,
    entitled ‘Method for the simulation of wear and corrosion for the detection of
    nickel released from coated items’, it refers to Regulation No 1907/2006.</p><p
    class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><a name="point79" id="point79">79</a>      Although,
    as is apparent from paragraph 74 of the present judgment, compliance with harmonised
    standards is not generally mandatory, that standard is, in the present case, manifestly
    mandatory, since Regulation No 1907/2006 provides, in paragraph 3 of entry 27
    of the table set out in Annex XVII thereto, that, as regards nickel, the standards
    adopted by CEN are to be used as test methods for demonstrating the conformity
    of the products concerned with paragraphs 1 and 2 of entry 27.</p><p class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><a
    name="point80" id="point80">80</a>      In the light of the foregoing considerations,
    it must be held, in accordance with the case-law referred to in paragraph 70 of
    the present judgment, that the requested harmonised standards form part of EU
    law.</p><p class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><a name="point81" id="point81">81</a>      In
    the second place, as the Advocate General noted in point 52 of her Opinion, Article 2
    TEU provides that the European Union is based on the principle of the rule of
    law, which requires free access to EU law for all natural or legal persons of
    the European Union, and that individuals must be able to ascertain unequivocally
    what their rights and obligations are (judgment of 22 February 2022, <i>Stichting
    Rookpreventie Jeugd and Others</i>, C‑160/20, EU:C:2022:101, paragraph 41 and
    the case-law cited). That free access must in particular enable any person whom
    legislation seeks to protect to verify, within the limits permitted by law, that
    the persons to whom the rules laid down by that law are addressed actually comply
    with those rules.</p><p class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><a name="point82" id="point82">82</a>      Accordingly,
    by the effects conferred on it by EU legislation, a harmonised standard may specify
    the rights conferred on individuals as well as their obligations and those specifications
    may be necessary for them to verify whether a given product or service actually
    complies with the requirements of such legislation.</p><p class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><a
    name="point83" id="point83">83</a>      In the third place, it must be recalled
    that the principle of transparency is inextricably linked to the principle of
    openness, which is enshrined in the second paragraph of Article 1 and Article 10(3)
    TEU, in Article 15(1) and Article 298(1) TFEU and in Article 42 of the Charter.
    It makes it possible, inter alia, to ensure that the administration enjoys greater
    legitimacy and is more effective and more accountable to the citizen in a democratic
    system (see, to that effect, judgment of 22 February 2022, <i>Stichting Rookpreventie
    Jeugd and Others</i>, C‑160/20, EU:C:2022:101, paragraph 35 and the case-law cited).</p><p
    class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><a name="point84" id="point84">84</a>      To that
    end, a right of access to documents is ensured under the first subparagraph of
    Article 15(3) TFEU and enshrined in Article 42 of the Charter, a right which has
    been implemented, inter alia, by Regulation No 1049/2001, Article 2(3) of which
    provides that it applies to all documents held by the Parliament, the Council
    or the Commission (see, to that effect, judgment of 22 February 2022, <i>Stichting
    Rookpreventie Jeugd and Others</i>, C‑160/20, EU:C:2022:101, paragraph 36).</p><p
    class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><a name="point85" id="point85">85</a>      In those
    circumstances, it must be held that there is an overriding public interest, within
    the meaning of the last clause of Article 4(2) of Regulation No 1049/2001, justifying
    the disclosure of the requested harmonised standards.</p><p class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><a
    name="point86" id="point86">86</a>      Therefore, the General Court erred in
    law in holding, in paragraphs 104 and 105 of the judgment under appeal, that there
    was no overriding public interest in the disclosure, pursuant to that provision,
    of the requested harmonised standards.</p><p class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><a name="point87"
    id="point87">87</a>      Consequently, the second ground of appeal must be upheld
    and, without it being necessary to examine the first ground of appeal, the judgment
    under appeal must be set aside.</p><p class="C04Titre1"> <b>The action before
    the General Court</b></p><p class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><a name="point88" id="point88">88</a>      In
    accordance with the first paragraph of Article 61 of the Statute of the Court
    of Justice of the European Union, the Court of Justice is to quash the decision
    of the General Court if the appeal is well founded. It may itself give final judgment
    in the matter, where the state of the proceedings so permits. That is the situation
    in the present case.</p><p class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><a name="point89" id="point89">89</a>      As
    is apparent from paragraphs 65 to 87 of the present judgment, the Commission should
    have acknowledged, in the decision at issue, the existence of an overriding public
    interest, within the meaning of the last clause of Article 4(2) of Regulation
    No 1049/2001, arising from the principles of the rule of law, transparency, openness
    and good governance, and justifying the disclosure of the requested harmonised
    standards, since those standards form part of EU law owing to their legal effects.</p><p
    class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><a name="point90" id="point90">90</a>      In those
    circumstances, the decision at issue must be annulled.</p><p class="C04Titre1"> <b>Costs</b></p><p
    class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><a name="point91" id="point91">91</a>      Under
    Article 184(2) of the Rules of Procedure, where an appeal is well founded and
    the Court itself gives final judgment in the case, the Court is to make a decision
    as to costs.</p><p class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><a name="point92" id="point92">92</a>      Under
    Article 138(1) of those rules, applicable to appeal proceedings by virtue of Article 184(1)
    thereof, the unsuccessful party is to be ordered to pay the costs if they have
    been applied for in the successful party’s pleadings.</p><p class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><a
    name="point93" id="point93">93</a>      In the present case, since the appellants
    have applied for costs and the Commission has been unsuccessful, the Commission
    must be ordered to pay the costs relating to both the proceedings before the General
    Court and the proceedings on appeal.</p><p class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><a name="point94"
    id="point94">94</a>      According to Article 184(4) of the Rules of Procedure,
    where the appeal has not been brought by an intervener at first instance, he or
    she may not be ordered to pay costs in the appeal proceedings unless he or she
    participated in the written or oral part of the proceedings before the Court.
    Where an intervener at first instance takes part in the proceedings, the Court
    may decide that he or she is to bear his or her own costs. Since the interveners
    at first instance participated in the written and oral parts of the appeal proceedings
    before the Court, they must be ordered to bear their own costs.</p><p class="C41DispositifIntroduction">On
    those grounds, the Court (Grand Chamber) hereby:</p><p class="C08Dispositif">1.      <b>Sets
