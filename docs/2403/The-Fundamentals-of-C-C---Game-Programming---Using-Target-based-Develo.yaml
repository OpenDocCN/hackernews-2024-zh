- en: This book is aimed at giving novice coders an understanding of the methods and
    techniques used in professional games development. Designed to help develop and
    strengthen problem solving and basic C/C++ skills, it also will help to develop
    familiarity targeting and using fixed/restricted hardware, which are key skills
    in console development. It allows the reader to increase their confidence as game
    programmers by walking them through increasingly involved game concepts, while
    maintaining the understanding that despite the increased complexity, the core
    methods remain consistent with the advancement of the technology; the technology
    only enhances the gaming experience. It also demonstrates underlying principles
    of game coding in practical step by step ways to increase exposure and confidence
    in game coding concepts.
