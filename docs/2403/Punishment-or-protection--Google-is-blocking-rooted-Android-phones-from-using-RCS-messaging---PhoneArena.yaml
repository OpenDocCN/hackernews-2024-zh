    the Android system where users are usually not allowed to go. It allows you to
    customize your device and is a practice that is frowned upon by phone manufacturers.

    blocked from working. And the phone could still show that the user is connected

    Fix. We should also point out that rooting your Android phone will stop your banking
    apps and Google Wallet from working. This makes sense as a way to protect the
    financial assets you have access to on your phone.

    send longer messages, share higher-quality pictures and videos, see typing indicators,

    designed to punish those who dare to root their Android phone.
