- en: An alleged arson attack at a power substation outside Berlin has knocked Tesla's
    nearby gigafactory offline, and a left-wing activist group is claiming that disrupting
    Tesla was their entire intent.

- en: Multiple news sources in Germany have reported the incident and cited German
    police's belief that the fire was suspected to be arson. Michael Stübgen, interior
    minister for the German state of Brandenburg, where the gigafactory is located
    and the fire took place, has likewise [called](https://mik.brandenburg.de/mik/de/start/service/presse/pressemitteilungen/detail-pm-und-meldungen/~05-03-2024-anschlag-auf-strominfrastruktur#)
    the fire "a perfidious arson attack" that damaged a high-voltage power line so
    badly it cut off power to both the Tesla factory and surrounding towns.

    our electricity infrastructure," Stübgen said in a statement today. "Thousands
    of people were cut off from basic services and put in danger."'

    "so I would warn against hasty speculation."

    extremist Volcano Group claimed responsibility in an alleged [post](https://kontrapolis.info/12465/)
    to German alternative news site Kontrapolis. The post accused Tesla of eating
    up "earth, resources, people [and] labor" and called Tesla owner Elon Musk a "technofascist"
    whose "green capitalism" is "a totalitarian technological attack on society."

- en: '"Our goal with our sabotage is to cause the largest possible blackout of the
    Gigafactory. We have ruled out endangering our lives and those of other people,"
    Volcano Group said in the post. "The shutdown of production in the automotive
    industry is the beginning of the end of a world of destruction."'

    if Volcano Group is responsible and its claims are accurate, they were aiming
    for maximum damage and repair difficulty at the substation.

    in Grünheide isn't new.

    activists have since constructed a [protest camp](https://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-europe-68464382)
    in the forest in a bid to prevent its destruction if Tesla and local authorities
    proceed with their plan.

    Whether those same locals will remain sympathetic after an arson attack knocked
    out their electricity may be a bigger ask. ®
