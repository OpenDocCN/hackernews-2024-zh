- en: The tech bros are fighting again. Last week, Apple blocked Epic Games from accessing
    its developer platform in Europe. The move would have prevented the Fortnite maker
    from building an app store to rival Apple’s just days before the European Union’s
    new competition measures — the [Digital Markets Act](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/mar/09/painful-day-for-tech-titans-as-eu-finally-sinks-its-regulatory-teeth-into-them)
    — designed to prevent just such a thing, come into effect. Then, in an about-face
    as the EU began an investigation, Apple [reversed course](https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/03/apple-backtracks-reinstates-epic-games-ios-developer-account-in-europe/)
    — a move Epic says is a response to “[public backlash](https://www.epicgames.com/site/en-US/news/apple-terminated-epic-s-developer-account)
    for retaliation.”

- en: Writing for the *New York Times*, Tripp Mickle [reports](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/06/technology/apple-epic-games-feud.html)
    that Apple’s attempt to block Epic was justified by the claim that Epic is a rule-breaker
    that refuses to stay within the lines drawn to keep the App Store secure. As a
    rationale, it’s thin gruel. Mickle notes further that “Apple also objected to
    Epic’s criticism of Apple’s plans to comply with Europe’s tech competition law”
    — which is to say the Cupertino giant was trying to convince people it would comply
    with attempts to limit anti-competitive behavior. Did anyone believe that?

    disconcerting monopolist bullying from Apple. The dispute between Apple and Epic
    is a stark reminder of Gilded Age misconduct. Private monopolies are undesirable
    as a rule and contemporary tech monopolists and oligopolists — in their sheer
    heft and reach — represent something even worse than their twentieth-century forebears.
    The tech battle is a call to double down on efforts to install democratic control
    over these companies that shape markets and so much of our lives.

    criticize Apple’s market dominance. He took specific issue with the company’s
    “app store monopoly, the digital goods payments monopoly, the tax, the suppression
    of true information about competing purchasing options, the blocking of competing
    web browser engines and outright destruction of web apps.”

    they are directed towards that end.” But he warned that “the woes begin when they
    are directed not to.”

    really great” — what we have here is a little tech world donnybrook that uncovers
    the internal struggles of an otherwise united class of capitalists. Technologists
    in the vein of Apple and Epic want to grow their companies and dominate the market.
    They want to maximize their number of users and profits. They want the value of
    their companies to rise as high as it can go. This public tech feud is thus a
    family affair, yet its implications are significant for all of us.

    monopoly, especially when states fail to control the market. Capitalists tend
    not to mind this phenomenon when they’re the monopolists. They like it far less,

    Years of fighting for antitrust laws aimed at some, *any*, regulation that might
    rebalance power. In the end, these fights managed to restrain them, and even broke
    some of them up, but the monopolies and oligopolies never died out.

    rose throughout the latter half of the twentieth century. Today, we are facing
    tech companies that are even more wealthy, entrenched, and globe-spanning than
    some of the worst offenders of the last century. The impact of their platforms
    — which effectively comprise the public agora and profoundly shape public discourse
    — on democracy is an open question. Increasingly, it’s one freighted with creeping

    aiming to curb their multinational corporate power and the technologies they deploy,
    often to great social and political damage. In Canada, the Online News Act tried
    to compel Meta and Google to return a modest amount of what they’ve extracted
    from consumers through payments to news outlets for content shared on the platforms.
    This resulted in Meta [banning news](https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/meta-ending-news-availability-permanently-1.6924370)
    from its platforms. The company is engaged in a similar [fight](https://theconversation.com/facebook-wont-keep-paying-australian-media-outlets-for-their-content-are-we-about-to-get-another-news-ban-224857)

    are stuck in geopolitical and domestic strategy limbo, such as the RESTRICT Act.
    Setting aside issues of free expression, the looming [ban](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/tiktok-ban-congress-bill-bytedance-divest/)
    of Tik Tok in the US proves that forceful regulation is not impossible. This case,
    however, is a rare instance of hegemonic geopolitical concerns trumping the preferences
    of tech behemoths, which isn’t exactly an outcome worth celebrating.

    giants whose strategic interest and profit-maximizing tendencies produce negative
    externalities for the rest of us. That work must be done day by day and bit by

    by Silicon Valley and its devotees.

    than computers have existed, let alone Apple.

    inability of tech monopolists to share their nightmarish, habit-forming, surveillance-heavy,
    and exploitive technologies with one another is bog-standard market behavior.
    While this doesn’t justify it as right or good — in fact, quite the contrary —
    it does align with the self-serving rules of capitalists. There is no tech behemoth
    that would hesitate to act like Apple if the shoe was on the other foot. This
    behavior merely showcases the unchecked market power that companies aspire to
    wield.
