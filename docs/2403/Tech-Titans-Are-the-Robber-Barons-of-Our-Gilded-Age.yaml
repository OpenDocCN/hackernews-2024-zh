    that Apple’s attempt to block Epic was justified by the claim that Epic is a rule-breaker
    that refuses to stay within the lines drawn to keep the App Store secure. As a
    rationale, it’s thin gruel. Mickle notes further that “Apple also objected to
    Epic’s criticism of Apple’s plans to comply with Europe’s tech competition law”
    — which is to say the Cupertino giant was trying to convince people it would comply
    with attempts to limit anti-competitive behavior. Did anyone believe that?

    —— 这意味着库比蒂诺巨人试图说服人们，其将遵守限制反竞争行为的尝试。有人会相信吗？

    disconcerting monopolist bullying from Apple. The dispute between Apple and Epic

    as a rule and contemporary tech monopolists and oligopolists — in their sheer
    heft and reach — represent something even worse than their twentieth-century forebears.
