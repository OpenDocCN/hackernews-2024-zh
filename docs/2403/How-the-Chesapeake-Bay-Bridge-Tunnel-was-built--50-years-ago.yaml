    a unique blend of vigilance and derring-do.

- en: Transfers between boats, barges and the growing bridge presented a frequent
    danger. Captains could not always nose their crafts neatly against ladders, so
    workers often had to jump from a rocking boat or land on one, the surfaces slippery
    from sea spray and, in the winter, ice.
  prefs: []

- en: In rough weather, the men tried to leap from the boat when the bow was at its
    highest point. Jumping too soon put them at risk of getting smacked by the craft
    on its upswing. Too late, and they might miss their target.

    as he was about to land. His gruff foreman told him he was overreacting to the
    pain. Foster didn't know he had a broken leg until six weeks later, when bad weather
    gave him a day off and time to see a doctor.

    Created for the project, the steel contraption sat on top of the concrete pilings
    that were pounded in sets of three every 75 feet along the route.

- en: At the front of the rig, workers cut off uneven portions of the pilings that
    had been placed ahead of it. The soil at the bottom of the bay varied in firmness,
    and not every pile could be driven to the same depth. Some went so deep that they
    didn't stick far enough out of the water. Those needed another section of piling
    to bring them to the correct height.

- en: On the Monster's back end, a crane lifted a rectangular concrete block off a
    barge and lowered it over the pilings behind. More concrete was poured to secure
    it. When capped, each set of three pilings, called a bent, looked like a Stonehenge
    monument sticking out of the water. Another rig followed, setting slabs of concrete
    roadway - more than 3,400 in all - over the supports.

- en: Work on the Monster literally rolled along. Railroad tracks attached to the
    underside of the rig allowed it to move from bent to bent over temporary wheels
    that were placed on the uncapped pilings after they were sheared to size.

- en: On the water, a boisterous boat captain from Louisiana ferried the caps and
    additional concrete to the Monster. Known as "Wide Open Wells" because of his
    fondness for going full throttle, he stood well over 6 feet and steered with large,
    weathered hands that looked like a blacksmith's.

- en: On warm days, workers heard Wide Open through his windows and over the roar
    of his engines, singing in a Cajun accent about bayous. Other times, they could
    hear him swearing at his deckhand.

- en: Something had gone awry on a crane while it was moving a cap. The 40-ton block
    came out of a sling and plummeted past men on the rig. Foster, standing on an
    exposed walkway, watched it hit the water. For a split second, he saw clear to
    the bay's sandy bottom as it landed. The next moment, an enormous splash drenched
    him.

- en: The sudden release of tension on the crane sent its boom snapping upward. A
    worker on the Monster's deck sprinted away, thinking he might have to jump clear
    of the rigging if the whole thing tipped.

    the scare. Afterward, the foreman, Bill Eskins, gathered his crew.

    killed when a boiler exploded. Two more died when a boom on an island collapsed.
    Another was killed when a cable snapped and struck him. Yet another was electrocuted.
    The seventh death happened at a yard in Texas where the tunnel sections were cast.
