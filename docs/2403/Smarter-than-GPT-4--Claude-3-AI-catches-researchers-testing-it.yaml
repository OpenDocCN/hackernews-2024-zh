- en: Working on these next-gen intelligent AIs must be a freaky experience. As Anthropic
    announces the smartest model ever tested across a range of benchmarks, researchers
    recall a chilling moment when Claude 3 realized that it was being evaluated.

- en: Anthropic, you may recall, was founded in 2021 by a group of senior [OpenAI
    team](https://newatlas.com/tag/open-ai/) members, who broke away because they
    didn't agree with OpenAI's decision to work closely with Microsoft. The company's
    [Claude](https://newatlas.com/technology/gpt-iphone-claude-slack/) and Claude
    2 AIs have been competitive with GPT models, but neither Anthropic nor Claude
    have really broken through into public awareness.

- en: That could well change with Claude 3, since Anthropic now claims to have surpassed
    GPT-4 and Google's Gemini 1.0 model on a range of multimodal tests, setting new
    industry benchmarks "across a wide range of cognitive tasks."

- en: So what's different? Well, the three different Claude 3 models will all launch
    with a 200,000-token context window, but they're all capable of generating nearly-instant
    responses given inputs "exceeding a million tokens."

- en: To put that in context, Tolstoy's 1,200-page, 580,000-word epic *War and Peace*
    is one heck of a meaty tome, but it might crunch down to about 750,000 tokens.
    So Claude 3 can accept significantly more than one *War and Peace* worth of input
    data, and understand it all at once while formulating "near-instant" answers for
    you.

- en: Claude 3, says Anthropic, is less likely than its previous models to refuse
    to answer questions deemed close to the guardrails of safety and decency – but
    on the other hand, the team says it's also meticulously tested and hard to jailbreak.

    better at following "complex, multi-step instructions," and "particularly adept
    at adhering to brand voice and response guidelines, and developing customer-facing
    experiences our users can trust." Its strong visual capabilities give it a next-gen
    ability to understand and work with photos, charts, graphs, flowcharts and technical
    diagrams.

    by a wide margin, and its abilities on the HumanEval coding test are absolutely
    outstanding.

- en: AI industry followers will notice that Google's Gemini 1.5 and OpenAI's GPT-4
    Turbo models aren't represented – indeed, there's currently no equivalent benchmark
    data on these two, so while Claude 3 is king of the stat sheets, these two models
    may yet have the advantage in the real world.

- en: And as should be abundantly clear by now, OpenAI almost certainly has GPT-5,
    and maybe something beyond, fully trained and in the process of alignment and
    testing. The way [Sora](https://newatlas.com/technology/openai-sora-video-ai/)
    was released to [bury Gemini 1.5](https://newatlas.com/technology/ai-video-games-genie/)
    in the news cycle, we're sure OpenAI has other major bombs cued up ready to drop
    whenever it's deemed necessary.

- en: In that sense, the fact that OpenAI doesn't seem to have released anything today
    might say more about its opinion of Anthropic as a genuine competitor than it
    does about who's got the smartest model.

- en: Still, Claude is definitely sharp – too sharp, perhaps, for the kinds of tests
    companies are using to evaluate their models by. In "needle in a haystack" testing,
    where a single random sentence is buried in an avalanche of information, and the
    model is asked a question pertaining to that exact sentence, Claude gave a response
    that seemed to turn around and look straight at the researchers. "I suspect this
    pizza topping "fact" may have been inserted as a joke or to test if I was paying
    attention."

    of information about existing and older language models is now part of the training
    of new models.

- en: It'd certainly be interesting to know exactly what "self-awareness" means to
    companies working on AI, and indeed what the current definition of Artificial
    General Intelligence is. Because it looks like we'll be needing some very clear
    definitions of these concepts in the coming years. Or maybe months. Or heck, in
    this space, maybe weeks.
