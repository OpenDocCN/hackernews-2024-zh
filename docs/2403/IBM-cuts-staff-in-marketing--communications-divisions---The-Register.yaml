    today by CNBC, and doesn't include any mention of numbers. The layoffs were reportedly

    [exclusive story](https://www.theregister.com/2024/02/29/ibm_launches_voluntary_redundancy_scheme/)
    last month. Big Blue told us it was looking for employees to take a voluntary
    severance, primarily in its enterprise ops and support, Q2C, finance and operations
    divisions, the latter of which includes communications and marketing.

    its workforce and would involve "a very low single digit percentage of IBM's global
    workforce." The company said it expected to end 2024 with "roughly" the same level
    of employment as it had at the beginning of the year.

    especially areas such as AI and hybrid cloud," we were told in February.'

    last year, IBM CEO Arvind Krishna said he thought [around 30 percent](https://www.theregister.com/2023/05/02/ibm_ai_back_office_jobs/)
    of IBM's back office staff, equating to roughly 7,800 people, could be replaced
    with the technology. Krishna said IBM would likely slow hiring in affected areas
    over the next five years, though what those areas are wasn't made clear.

    that IBM was upskilling all its employees on AI, and rather than laying them off
    to be replaced with AI he saw those skills as a way to gain an economic advantage.
