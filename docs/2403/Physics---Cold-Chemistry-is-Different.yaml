- en: '**×** **Many common small molecules are formed in interstellar space, and their
    low temperatures are expected to have profound effects on their chemical reactions
    because of quantum-mechanical effects that are masked at higher temperatures.
    Researchers have now demonstrated some of these cold chemistry phenomena—such
    as the effects of molecular rotation and collision energy on reaction rates—in
    a reaction between a hydrogen ion and an ammonia molecule in the lab. The results,
    while intuitively surprising at first glance, can be explained by a careful theoretical
    analysis of the quantum chemistry.'

- en: Measuring reaction rates at low temperatures is useful for testing quantum-chemical
    theory because in those conditions molecules may occupy only a few well-defined
    quantum states. Such experiments could also offer insights into chemical processes
    in the cold clouds of gas in star-forming regions of interstellar space, where
    many of the simple molecules that make up solar systems are formed. But low-temperature
    experiments are difficult, especially for charged atoms and molecules (ions),
    because they are very sensitive to stray electric fields in the environment, which
    accelerate and heat up the ions.

    on ion–molecule reactions at low temperatures was available, and theoretical predictions
    made many years ago were never tested,” says physical chemist Frédéric Merkt of
    the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETH) in Zurich. To address this challenge,
    Merkt and his ETH colleagues studied reactions between two molecules that are
    common in interstellar clouds: hydrogen ions ( <math><mrow><msubsup><mrow><mtext>H</mtext></mrow><mrow><mn>2</mn></mrow><mrow><mo>+</mo></mrow></msubsup></mrow></math>)
    and ammonia ( <math><mrow><msub><mrow><mtext>NH</mtext></mrow><mrow><mn>3</mn></mrow></msub></mrow></math>).
    They used heavy hydrogen (deuterium) molecular ions, <math><mrow><msubsup><mrow><mtext>D</mtext></mrow><mrow><mn>2</mn></mrow><mrow><mo>+</mo></mrow></msubsup></mrow></math>,
    because it is easier to match the speeds of these heavier molecules with the slower

    “electron shell,” keeping it electrically neutral to the outside world—which makes

    the molecules—equivalent to temperatures from 50 K down to near absolute zero—but
    they could also selectively probe the various quantum rotational states, which
    are distinguished by how fast the molecules rotate. They found that as the collision
    energy decreased or the ammonia’s rotational energy increased, the reaction rates
    increased. Both outcomes are the opposite of what generally occurs for reactions
    at high temperatures: Lower collision energies tend to lower the chance of reaction,

    electrostatic interaction between <math><mrow><msubsup><mrow><mtext>D</mtext></mrow><mrow><mn>2</mn></mrow><mrow><mo>+</mo></mrow></msubsup></mrow></math>and
    an approaching ammonia molecule. This electrical attraction dominates how the
    molecules “feel” one another in this reaction and thus largely determines the
    reaction rate. For example, in certain quantum states, rotational excitation can
