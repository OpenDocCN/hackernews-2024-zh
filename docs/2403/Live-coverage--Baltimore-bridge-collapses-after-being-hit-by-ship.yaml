    Francis Scott Key Bridge early Tuesday. Coast Guard officials said around 7:30
    p.m. Tuesday, nearly 18 hours after the bridge collapsed, that the six people
    are still unaccounted for. Those people are presumed dead, authorities say, and
    a search and rescue mission is now a recovery mission.THE LATEST RIGHT NOW:• Officials
    confirmed six people who are missing after the collapse are presumed dead• Two
    people were initially rescued — one declined treatment and another was taken to,
    and subsequently discharged from, Shock Trauma• Preliminary investigation shows
    this was not intentional• Gov. Wes Moore said the crew on the ship notified authorities
    that they had lost power.• Moore said between a Mayday call and the collapse,
    officials stopped the flow of traffic so that more cars were not on the bridge,
    potentially saving lives• Baltimore Beltway\I-695 closed from Glen Burnie to Dundalk
    (traffic map here)Maryland Gov. Wes Moore declared a state of emergency after
    a cargo ship, the cargo ship "Dali," crashed into a support structure of the 1.6-mile
    bridge that carried the Baltimore Beltway\Interstate 695 over the Patapsco River.
    Its collapse was reported around 1:30 a.m. Tuesday.Video posted online shows the
    entire structure breaking apart in several locations and collapsing. The Associated
    Press reported the ship caught fire, and thick, black smoke billowed from it.
    SkyTeam 11 reported the portion of the bridge that collapsed was the steel superstructure
    and that the concrete bridge appeared to remain intact. Video below: Gov. Moore
    provides an update early Wednesday morning on recovery efforts6 presumed deadAfter
    nearly 18 hours of searching, six people are presumed dead. A group of construction
    workers was on the bridge when it collapsed, officials said. Six of those individuals
    are unaccounted for.Video below: Somber scene left behind at Key Bridge Tuesday
    night"Based on the length of time that we''ve gone in the search, the extensive
    search efforts we''ve put into it, the water temperature, we do not believe that
    we are going to find any of these individuals alive, and so this evening around
    7:30, we are going to suspend active search and rescue efforts," said U.S. Coast
    Guard Rear Admiral Shannon Gilreath.Gilreath said those recovery efforts will
    resume Wednesday morning. The crash happened in the middle of the night, long
    before the busy morning commute on the bridge that was used by 12 million vehicles
    last year. The six people still unaccounted for were part of a construction crew
    filling potholes on the bridge, said Paul Wiedefeld, the state’s transportation
    secretary.To the families of those missing, Maryland Gov. Wes Moore said Tuesday
    afternoon at a news conference: "We are here with you every step of the way. We
    are praying with you.""This is an excruciating day for several families who woke
    up today to news that no one wants to receive. They are hoping and praying, and
    we are hoping and praying with them. We are all putting our arms around the city
    of Baltimore," U.S. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said at a news conference
    Tuesday afternoon.Port of Baltimore operationsThe Maryland Port Administration
    suspended vessel traffic into and out of the Port of Baltimore until further notice.
    The port is not shut down and they are still processing trucks inside of the terminals.Starting
    Wednesday, the New Vail Street gate will close until further notice. All truck
    traffic must enter through the Seagirt main gate at 2600 Broening Highway.The
    Seagirt main gate will not be extended to 5:30 p.m. on Thursday as previously
    scheduled. It will close at the normal time of 4:30 p.m.The Seagirt Marine Terminal
    will be closed on Good Friday.Authorities: No credible information to suggest
    terrorismBaltimore Police Commissioner Richard Worley said there is no intelligence
    or any indication that the incident was intentional.The FBI released the following
    statement, saying: "There is no specific and credible information to suggest any
    ties to terrorism at this time. The investigation is ongoing. FBI Baltimore will
    continue to support our partners at the local, state and federal levels."Video
    below captures collapse of Key BridgeThe ship underwent 27 inspections since the
    Dali came into service in 2016\. There were no issues until June when Chilean
    authorities found deficiencies in propulsion and the auxiliary machinery.DHS said
    the Dali lost propulsion as it left Baltimore Harbor, which makes the June inspection
    particularly interesting. SkyTeam 11 video below shows bridge collapse & point

    "My office is in close communication with U.S. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg,
    Baltimore Mayor Brandon Scott, Baltimore County Executive Johnny Olszewski and
    the Baltimore Fire Department as emergency personnel are on the scene following
    the collapse of the Francis Scott Key Bridge.Video below: "Still actively looking

    everyone''s safety."We will remain in close contact with federal, state, and local
    entities that are carrying out rescue efforts as we continue to assess and respond
    to this tragedy."Baltimore Mayor Brandon Scott issued an executive order declaring
    a state of emergency in Baltimore City in response to the collapse starting at
    9 a.m. and will remain in place for 30 days, which enables the mobilization of
    emergency services and resources.Video below: Lester Holt — ''Sometimes you see

    something out of a movie ... Our focus should be the preservation of life.""We
    all awoke this morning to an unspeakable tragedy," Baltimore County Executive
    Johnny Olszewski said at a news conference early Tuesday morning. "We have a long
    road ahead not just in the search and rescue but in the fallout after this." Alternate

    Federal government will pay to rebuild bridgePresident Joe Biden spoke on the
    bridge collapse Tuesday afternoon, saying the federal government will send all
    the resources needed by the city and state.Video: President speaks about bridge
    collapse"We''re with you, we''re going to stay with you for as long as it takes.
    Like the governor said, you''re Maryland tough, you''re Baltimore strong and we''re
    going to get through this together, and I promise we''re not leaving," Biden said.The
    president called on Congress to put into motion the federal government paying
    for the construction of a replacement bridge."It''s my intention that the federal
    government will pay for the entire cost to reconstruct the bridge," Biden said.Buttigieg
    said the president''s plan is to rebuild the bridge and reopen the port. He said
    the administration is prepared to approve emergency funding upon request from
    the state.Video below: NTSB provides update on Key Bridge collapseThe Federal
    Highway Administration released a statement, saying: "The I-695 corridor is a
    vital connection for people and goods traveling along the East Coast, and we stand
    ready to offer technical assistance — including emergency relief funding — to
    help manage traffic and rebuild the bridge as quickly and safely as possible.
    "In response to the collapse, the U.S. Department of Transportation and Federal
    Highway Administration have been actively coordinating with federal, state, and
    local officials in the region, including the Maryland Department of Transportation,
    the Maryland Transportation Authority, the city of Baltimore, U.S. Coast Guard,
    NTSB and others."Secretary (Pete) Buttigieg, Federal Highway Administrator (Shailen)
    Bhatt, and the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) are on site today to
    offer federal support and assistance." What''s next?The collapse is sure to create
    a logistical nightmare for months, if not years, along the East Coast, shutting
    down ship traffic at the Port of Baltimore, a major shipping hub. The accident
    will also snarl cargo and commuter traffic.“Losing this bridge will devastate
    the entire area, as well as the entire East Coast,” Maryland state Sen. Johnny
    Ray Salling said.Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, speaking at a news conference
    near the site Tuesday, said it was too soon to estimate how long it will take
    to clear the channel, which is about 50 feet deep.“This is no ordinary bridge.
    This is one of the cathedrals of American infrastructure,” he said at a news conference
    in Baltimore on Tuesday afternoon. “It has been part of the skyline for this region
    for longer than many of us have been alive.”Highway signs as far south as Virginia
    are warning drivers of delays associated with the closure of the bridge.“Aside
    from the obvious tragedy, this incident will have significant and long-lasting
    impacts on the region,” American Trucking Associations spokesperson Jessica Gail
    said, calling Key Bridge and Baltimore’s port “critical components’’ of the nation’s
    infrastructure.Gail noted that 1.3 million trucks cross the bridge every year
    — 3,600 a day. Trucks that carry hazardous materials will now have to make 30
    miles of detours around Baltimore because they are prohibited from using the city’s
    tunnels, she said, adding to delays and increasing fuel costs.Where is this bridge?The
    Key Bridge opened in 1977, completing the Baltimore Beltway''s circumference around
    the city. The bridge is southeast of the city proper and spanned from Sparrows
    Point to the southernmost tip of Baltimore.According to an Maryland Transportation
    Authority report issued in November, the Key Bridge carried more than 12.4 million
    commercial and passenger vehicles in 2023.Federal Highway Administration records
    show the bridge was last inspected in May 2021, when inspectors rated it in fair
    condition overall at a rating of six (satisfactory) out of nine on three parameters.
    These inspections are supposed to occur every 24 months.The Key Bridge was indeed
    last inspected in May 2023 and "found to be in satisfactory condition with an
    overall rating of fair," per a press aide for U.S. Transportation Secretary Pete
    Buttigieg. That inspection found the bridge was in fair condition as well. Check
