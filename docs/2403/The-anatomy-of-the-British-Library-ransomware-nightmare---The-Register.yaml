    October didn't have the visceral physical aspect that creates a folk memory, but
    it should for anyone who makes enterprise IT. Five months on, not only are significant
    systems not restored, they've gone forever. Remedial work and rebuilding is going
    to drain cash reserves intended to last seven years. It was and **is** bad. What
    makes it even more exceptional is that we now know what happened and why.

- en: The gories are all in a [substantial, detailed report](https://www.theregister.com/2024/03/11/british_library_slaps_the_cloud/)

    any risk of a 2am phone call demanding you drive to the datacenter, even more
    so if it's the CEO pulling up the Teams meeting in ten minutes. Truth is, it's

- en: The British Library has many personalities. It has a unique, complex set of
    roles, which are uniquely regulated by law. Looked at another way, it is typical
    of national and other large institutions, in that IT infrastructure competes for
    resources against long-established core services, often unsuccessfully. In yet
    another light, that's true to some extent for all organizations. The British Library's
    situation is also merely a magnificent example of what can go wrong. All these
    perspectives are true, but the last has the widest implications.

  zh: 大英图书馆有许多个性。它拥有一套独特而复杂的角色，这些角色受法律独特的监管。换个角度看，它与其他国家和大型机构一样，在IT基础设施与长期建立的核心服务之间竞争资源，通常是不成功的。从另一个角度来看，对所有组织来说这也是真实的。大英图书馆的情况只是一个了不起的事例，展示了可能出现的问题。所有这些观点都是正确的，但最后一个具有最广泛的影响。
- en: If you have any years on you in this game, you will have first-hand experience

    systems too old to be safe, too expensive in time and money to replace, while
    more pressing needs exist. People who are asked to do too much with too little.
    The deadly inertia of complexity. New projects that leave older systems to wither
