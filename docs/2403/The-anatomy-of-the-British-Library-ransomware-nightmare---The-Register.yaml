    entirely wrong – we'll get to that in a bit – and that's not important. What matters
    is we think such a thing is so tragic, so emblematic of cultural collapse, that
    we've told ourselves that story for nearly two thousand years.

    October didn't have the visceral physical aspect that creates a folk memory, but
    it should for anyone who makes enterprise IT. Five months on, not only are significant
    systems not restored, they've gone forever. Remedial work and rebuilding is going
    to drain cash reserves intended to last seven years. It was and **is** bad. What
    makes it even more exceptional is that we now know what happened and why.

- en: The gories are all in a [substantial, detailed report](https://www.theregister.com/2024/03/11/british_library_slaps_the_cloud/)
    released by the British Library itself. It's a must-read if your life involves
    any risk of a 2am phone call demanding you drive to the datacenter, even more
    so if it's the CEO pulling up the Teams meeting in ten minutes. Truth is, it's
    worth much more than a read, once you realize what the report represents. To get
    there, let's look at what the institution actually represents.

- en: The British Library has many personalities. It has a unique, complex set of
    roles, which are uniquely regulated by law. Looked at another way, it is typical
    of national and other large institutions, in that IT infrastructure competes for
    resources against long-established core services, often unsuccessfully. In yet
    another light, that's true to some extent for all organizations. The British Library's
    situation is also merely a magnificent example of what can go wrong. All these
    perspectives are true, but the last has the widest implications.

    of some of the factors identified in the report as enabling the disaster. Legacy
    systems too old to be safe, too expensive in time and money to replace, while
    more pressing needs exist. People who are asked to do too much with too little.
    The deadly inertia of complexity. New projects that leave older systems to wither
    in the shade. Security that rigorously defends against the wrong thing. The report
    is, as befits the institution itself, a comprehensive catalog of important stories.

    and commercial pressure to keep post-disaster dirty laundry out of sight leaves
    lessons unlearned, in general and often within the afflicted organization itself.
    The bigger the org, the harder the laundry.

    service provider, it doesn't matter. The enterprise IT infrastructure industry
    worldwide has been given a chance to audit its own practices as they really are,
    and the consequences that really flow. Internal reports can be written and cases
    made at all levels to plan, rebuild, manage and prioritize with wisdom and awareness.

    endless webinars, case studies and white papers by people with something to sell.
    There may be decent talks at industry conferences, chapters in textbooks and Youtube
    videos, none of which will be seen by the top-level policymakers who are the ultimate
    power brokers in how an organization perceives its infrastructure responsibilities.

    accident investigation revealed anything like the scope and systemic misadventure
    of the British Library report, it would shake up the aviation world so hard its
    rivets would pop. Lacking an external regulator with teeth like the FAA or CAA,
    and with no taste for self-regulation, there is no engine for reform, no roadmap
    of responsibility.

    failure of systemic integrity such as the British Library experienced. Yet hospitals,
    safety-critical services and physical infrastructure are also regularly attacked,
    and they share the same bad practices that are the wrong sort of industry standard.
    The calculus of harm from delay or diverted resources in such cases is impossible
    to quantify: they may not be counted, but there are always victims who relied
    on things not breaking, things that we let break.'

- en: In the absence of sustainable organizational sanity in how it sees IT, the British
    Library report can still be useful through subversion. Write that internal report
    drawing parallels between the evidence it contains and what's going on around
    you. Make it savagely to the point, keep it short, print it out, highlight the
    good bits with an old school yellow pen, and leave anonymous copies around the
    place. Slip one under the CEO's office door. Be as creatively mischievous – or
    not – as your corporate culture deserves. Just don't pass up the opportunity to
    use the power of a damned good story.

    it may or may not have been burned down by Julius Caesar, although it might not
    have been deliberate and it may have been rebuilt. What really did for it was
    politics and a slow strangulation through lack of resources. True terror for the
    ages, right there. ®
