    a first-ever product keynoteevent in New York City Tuesday night.

    which runs $5 per month, or $50 annually. Features, in addition to the 3% cash
    back, include no foreign transaction fees, a companion app that makes it relatively
    simple to create virtual and one-time cards, and the ability to set up cards for
    up to five family members with spending limits.

    interest on uninvested cash and a 3% match on Robinhood Retirement IRA contributions.

    a loss center for Robinhood.

    Even dining and travel usually have interchange rates around 2.2-2.8%. The loss
    is even worse on high-frequency categories such as gas and grocery which tend
    to have 1.1-1.8% in interchange rate. At major retailers like Walmart, Amazon
    or Costco (it’s a Visa), Robinhood will take the biggest hit because these are
    popular shopping places and they manage to negotiate with the networks to lower
    interchange to 0.7%. In other words, every transaction at such merchants, Robinhood
    will lose about 2.3% of the transaction volume.

- en: Sure, the Robinhood Gold membership fee will act as a cushion, but at $5/month,
    it will only take cardholders around $2,000 to recoup their money. Not a high
    amount. On top of that, Robinhood is on the hook for 5% APY on uninvested cash.
    ~~Yes, the uninvested balance is cash that Robinhood can invest and profit from,
    but will they clear the 5% hurdle every time?~~ I am not sure. Oh, did I mention
    that they would give 1% back on uninvested balance, in addition to the 5% APY?
    And 3% IRA matching? Whatever plan they have but don’t share, unsurprisingly,
    must be really good to make the maths work.

    the months to come. Because prospects can apply through an app, Robinhood will
    not have to invest in usual channels such as Direct Mail. I can tell you that
    not having Direct Mail will relieve the fintech firm of many operational expenses.
    Hence, their cost per account will be low.

    older and more mature folks on the market. If they are not careful, losses will
    run high and make the whole card book even less sustainable.

    underwriting model. The problem is that any model needs to have two things: 1/
    training data or in other words, a decent account base and 2/ enough time for
    card accounts to mature so that they can access the effectiveness of such model.
    But at first, Robinhood will have to tolerate some risks and acquire accounts
    with a suboptimal model. Plus, why kill the word of mouth momentum by being picky?'

    they want to diversify the customer base by attracting more seasoned and richer
    investors.

    if offered an opportunity, I’ll get the card for myself.
