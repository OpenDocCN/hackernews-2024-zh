- en: “So it took a bit longer for the commit counts to come down this release than
    I tend to prefer,” Torvalds [wrote](https://lkml.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/2403.1/01820.html)
    on the Linx kernel mailing list on Sunday, “but a lot of that seemed to be about
    various selftest updates (networking in particular) rather than any actual real
    sign of problems.”

    to delay 6.8.”

    that this cut of the kernel might need an eighth release candidate.

- en: Torvalds found time to note what he described as “a bit of random git numerology”
    as when work ended on this version of the kernel the git repository used to track
    it contained 9.996 million objects.”

    Torvalds wrote. “Of course, there is absolutely nothing special about it apart
    from a nice round number. Git doesn't care,” he added.

    well and truly passed ten million objects.

- en: Torvalds rated the addition of a new Xe drm driver as the most significant addition
    to this version of the kernel. The driver powers Intel GPUs, whether they’re integrated
    into a CPU or standalone devices, but is considered experimental.

- en: Another addition to the kernel adds support for Amazon Web Services’ “Nitro”,
    the cloud giant’s isolation tech that shifts security and networking chores to
    a SmartNIC. A new driver exposes the Nitro hardware to the kernel, allowing Linux
    guests to access the services it offers.

    fixes that helped to improve performance. Another enhancement brought the Rust-featuring
    kernel to CPUs using the made-in -China LoongArch architecture.

    plus thanks to those who have already submitted pulls for version 6.9 of the kernel
    before its merge window opened. ®
