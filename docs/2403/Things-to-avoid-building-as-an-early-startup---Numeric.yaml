     You've got a small team (perhaps no team beyond the founders) and you're building
    an offering which is still in the process of being defined and discovered.

    allowed us to make great progress with a small team and ultimately gain traction
    with our audience. Our velocity was driven substantially by the things we did
    not do. It's important as product builders to identify those asks and ideas which
    might slow progress on core value to users. To that end, here are a few of those
    things which we avoided at Numeric and have been generally happy to have done
    so.

    looks great in a sales demo. It helps paint the picture of what success looks

    enough core value to get people consistently engaged and coming back. Any dashboards

    it won't drive usage.

    feature"–its value is derived and dependent on other features of your product
    being used. It's not a good place to dedicate your early efforts. Put simply,
    if feature B depends on successful feature A, make A successful first.

    the roles of users, and relationships among these. [This article](https://www.osohq.com/post/ten-types-of-authorization#:~:text=At%20Oso%2C%20we're%20constantly,all%20of%20them%20are%20related.)

    in the data model were too frequent, and introducing permissions too early would
    be a disproportionate headache to build, evolve, and maintain.
  id: totrans-split-39

- en: By the time we did add a permissions model, the model was almost obvious. Our
    platform's design and data model had coalesced around a few primitives like workspaces,
    reports, and tasks. With the help of [Oso](https://www.osohq.com/) (both their
    software and their team), we were able to define a permissions model which was
    straight-forward enough that non-engineers can understand and discuss our user
    needs, and what we've built for authorization has been stable and long-lasting.

    to be prior. In retrospect they seem obvious, but at times it looked like abstractions
    were going to develop in a very different way. Had we introduced permissions too
    early, it might have artificially tied our plans and our minds to a worse model
    for the platform.'

    the idea. It''s difficult, but alongside a tight-knit team and a fast iteration
