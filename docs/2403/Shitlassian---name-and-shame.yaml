- en: As of today - no apologies from the company, nobody ever contacted. Managers
    are still there, practices are still the same. Moreover, Atlassian decided to
    retaliate for publishing my story, they applied zero-bonus multiplier, so I didn't
    get any bonus for 2020-2021\. They also refused to pay a referral fee of $5K (I
    invited a friend of mine to work for the company).

    cancer in Atlassian. Now it's the place where **you can share your story**. The
    process of spreading the word is ridiculously simple - you will need [Notion](https://www.notion.so/)
    and nothing else (see how to contribute below). You will own your story, and will
    be able to add updates it in a matter of seconds.

- en: '"**Shitlassian**" is a word/meme (noun or verb) that describes an action of
    employee disposal at the time of a struggle. It''s similar to "throw under the
    bus", but with emphasis that the person tried his/her best to fight for his/her
    own life.'
