- en: In Iceland only names which appear on the Personal Names Register are allowed
    to use. Other names cannot be used, but it is possible to apply to a committee
    for permission to use a name which is not yet listed.

- en: The committee does not accept every name. A name submitted to the naming committee
    for approval is considered for its compatibility with Icelandic tradition and
    for the likelihood that it might cause the bearer embarrassment. It must be compatible
    with Icelandic grammar and contain only letters occurring in the Icelandic alphabet.
    There are occasional exceptions, e.g. if a name has traditionally been used by
    a certain number of Icelanders.

- en: In recent years some changes have been made and the committee's decisions are
    not as strict as they used to be. Also, as the Icelandic parliament passed a Gender
    Autonomy Act in June 2019, a name's grammatical gender does not need to match
    the sex of the person bearing the name anymore.

- en: Iceland's strict naming rules have been discussed for a very long time now and
    even abolishing the name committee completely seems to be a possible outcome in
    the near future.
