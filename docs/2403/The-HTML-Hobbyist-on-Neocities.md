# The HTML Hobbyist on Neocities

> 来源：[https://htmlhobbyist.neocities.org/](https://htmlhobbyist.neocities.org/)

## Welcome to the World Wide Web…

I’m N.E. Lilly. You can call me Nathan. I’ve been developing websites for a long, long time. I’ve used Mosaic and watched the rise of Netscape Navigator. I learned JavaScript when all it could do was stupid browser tricks and DHTML was cutting-edge. I’m a veteran of the Browser Wars. I was recently hit with [a mighty powerful wave of nostalgia](https://journal.lilly.art/world-wide-web-nostalgia/): I miss ye olde World Wide Web. I miss the unadulterated optimism that we had for Cyberspace. I miss the seriousness about silliness and the silliness about seriousness that we found on the ’Net. I miss the infinite variety that we found in our pre-mobile Matrix analog. I miss the 1,000 different fanzines. [I want it all back](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzEgPbd0hfo).

I ♥ and admire Neocities’ goals:

> I am tired of living in an online world where people are isolated from each other in boring, spied-on gated communities, and are given generic templates which define what people are supposed to know about each other. It’s time we took back our personalities from these sterilized, lifeless, monetized, monitored entities and let our creativity flourish again.

I built *this* particular website to see just what [Neocities](https://neocities.org/) is capable of, so that I can provide guidance and advice via [The HTML Hobbyist](https://www.htmlhobbyist.com/) to people who want to make websites. *Kudos to the creators.*
