- en: <content>I have a very clear idea of what my “ideal” computer would be. It would
    incorporate all of the best aspects of the different computers (including smartphones!)
    I already use today, into a single machine.

- en: First, it would have the form factor of a typical smartphone. This would allow
    me to carry it everywhere, and use it both one-handed and two-handed. I might
    even have it be a “hotdog-style foldable” to allow for comfier reading. That form
    factor would also allow me to stand it on a table without the use of an external
    kickstand.

    equivalent in performance and efficiency to Apple’s M-series. As much RAM (> 16GB)
    storage (> 1TB) and battery (> 4000 mAh) that could fit in it. A USB-C port. Nothing
    extraneous… no gimmicks. All of it would be 100% open source, well documented,
    and free of black-boxes.

    The user would have full root permissions on this OS, and it would be a true Linux
    distro, not an Android derivative. It would use a declarative style of package
    management. It would be able to switch its display and window managers on-the-fly
    to suit whatever form factor it was being used in. Emulators and compatibility
    layers would allow apps and programs written for other systems to be used seamlessly.

    it in to a USB-C docking station at a desk. That dock is then connected to a mouse,
    keyboard, monitor, webcam, and external GPU. That would allow the computer to
    be used for coding, or graphic design. A similar dock in the form of a laptop
    shell could also be used. A dock near a TV could be used to turn it into a home
    entertainment system or video game console. VR headsets could even be connected
    to it. Bluetooth and WiFi would open up even more possibilities.

    well as a lot of second-order ones.

- en: It consolidates many devices into a single one. This removes the need to sync
    files and programs across devices. That, in turn, means that lots of proprietary
    cloud software needed for syncing can be dropped. Including phone apps that are
    notoriously hard to sync between devices without using a cloud intermediary. This
    also means that programs can be decoupled from the data they manipulate. Having
    the notes app just be a simple text editor on a .txt file, with no syncing required,
    would make taking notes a LOT simpler. (Assuming the UI/UX was adaptable to different
    form factors.) This benefit would extend to ALL of the other apps and programs
    I use. Imagine movies, books, TV shows, games, papers, documents and more. No
    sync necessary. Readable and writable by any program you choose.

    on the device is FOSS, including its hardware, then everything is fully auditable.
    The lack of syncing also greatly increases data privacy and security. The OS and
    software being FOSS also gives a lot of freedom in how the device can be used.

- en: Additionally, it gives an incentive to invest more time in making the computer
    my own. I often don’t bother syncing all of my files, videos, games, programs,
    desktop customizations, tools, scripts, etc to all of my devices. Sometimes it’s
    not possible (e.g. You can’t run useful Python scripts on a traditional smartphone)
    or just a huge pain (e.g. recreating the same system color theme on a smartphone
    and a laptop). Using a declarative Linux OS would also greatly help with this.

    becomes a lot better if you always have a phone-sized device with ALL your games
    on it. Especially if you can connect bluetooth controllers to it. Not getting
    enough horsepower? Just plug it in to the eGPU at your TV… and play any game you
    want. Or run AI models locally. Or unplug it and prop it up to watch a cooking
    video in the kitchen. Then later slot it into its laptop shell to get some writing
    done on the couch.

    improve the use I get out of my day-to-day computing. The fact that everything
    is fully open source, audited and secure would also give me immense peace of mind.

    to be gaining popularity… but it’s early stages and [might face some headwinds](https://cset.georgetown.edu/article/risc-v-what-it-is-and-why-it-matters/).
    The rest of the hardware would ALSO need to be FOSS as well. This is probably
    the part that’s furthest away.

    computer to get made. I think that while progress on the individual pieces is
    slow… they’re all progressing in parallel with each other. Given that, I expect
    it to seem hopeless for many years… until suddenly it’s not, and each individual
    piece reaches some critical threshold. Then it’s just a matter of integrating
    them together.
