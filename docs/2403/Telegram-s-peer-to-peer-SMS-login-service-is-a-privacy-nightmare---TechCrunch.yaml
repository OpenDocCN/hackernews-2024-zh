- en: Telegram has introduced a controversial new feature that grants users a free
    premium membership in exchange for allowing the instant messaging app to utilize
    their phone number as a relay for sending one-time SMS passwords to other users
    attempting to log into the platform, raising concerns about potential privacy
    risks and the exposure of personal information.

    channel (via reverse engineer [AssembleDebug](https://twitter.com/AssembleDebug)),
    is rolling out in select countries for Telegram for Android users. If you agree
    to let Telegram use your number as an OTP relay, the company will send you a transferable
    code for Telegram Premium.

    that the company will send a maximum of 150 OTP messages per month. Participating
    users, who may also be charged for local and international SMS usage, will have
    to hit a certain quota to be able to avail the complimentary subscription. From
    a monetary perspective, you might end up paying more through your phone bill than
    the value of Telegram’s premium membership.

    your number and use it for spam and fraud. Telegram allows users to hide their
    phone numbers from strangers, but using your number as a relay could allow them
    to look up your Telegram account.

    [transcription, exclusive stickers, reactions and other customizations](https://techcrunch.com/2022/06/19/telegram-tops-700-million-users-launches-premium-tier/).
    Telegram has introduced features like [Stories](https://techcrunch.com/2023/07/21/telegram-rolls-out-stories-feature-premium-users/)
    for paid users. However, users opting into the peer-to-peer login system have
    to think if giving out their phone number to strangers to save a few bucks is
    worth the hassle.
