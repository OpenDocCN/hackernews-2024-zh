- en: Nintendo might not need [to individually sue emulators out of existence](/24098640/nintendo-emulator-yuzu-lawsuit-switch-aftermath)
    to drive them deeper underground. Today, [GitLab cut off access to Nintendo Switch
    emulator Suyu](https://gitlab.com/suyu-emu/suyu), and disabled the accounts of
    its developers, after receiving what appears to be a scary email in the form of
    a DMCA takedown request.

- en: “GitLab received a DMCA takedown notice from a representative of the rightsholder
    and followed our standard process [outlined here](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/legal/dmca/),”
    spokesperson Kristen Butler tells *The Verge*.

- en: Suyu was a fork of Yuzu, the emulator that Nintendo successfully sued, but this
    isn’t about Nintendo now having the rights to Yuzu’s code — or maybe even Nintendo
    at all? Nintendo didn’t necessarily win the rights to Yuzu’s code [in its settlement](/2024/3/4/24090357/nintendo-yuzu-emulator-lawsuit-settlement),
    and GitLab didn’t tell *The Verge* that Nintendo is behind the takedown.

    Suyu’s Discord and [published earlier by Overkill.wtf](https://overkill.wtf/suyu-emulator-removed-from-gitlab/)
    — whoever sent the takedown request is trying to piggyback on how Yuzu allegedly
    violated DMCA 1201 by circumventing Nintendo’s technical protection measures.
    Oh, and maybe also subtly threatening GitLab with unlawful trafficking (also part
    of DMCA 1201) while they’re at it.

    DMCA takedown request [should technically contain](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/512)
    “Identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed,” and that
    DMCA 1201 is not the same thing as DMCA 512, which covers takedown requests.

    it does not include the same circumvention measures as Yuzu.

- en: But those lawyers also told me that valid or invalid, it doesn’t necessarily
    matter all that much, since a platform like GitLab doesn’t have to host anything
    that it doesn’t want to host. It may not be worth the time and effort to push
    back on an invalid DMCA takedown request to protect something you might not even
    care to protect — particularly if the alternative might be Nintendo coming at
    you with an actual lawsuit.

- en: GitLab didn’t immediately answer a question about whether it’s company policy
    to disable user’s accounts *before* giving them the opportunity to delete their
    projects or file a DMCA counter-notice. The company’s online handbook does not
    say why GitLab might decide to block or ban a user from its platform; only that
    “we may, in appropriate circumstances, disable access or terminate the account(s)
    of the reported user(s).”

    wrote “I’m most certainly going to host a copy of the code.” By that point, another
    member had already cloned the repository to [git.suyu.dev.](https://git.suyu.dev/)
