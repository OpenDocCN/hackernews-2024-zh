- en: I recently got my very first patch into PostgreSQL! To be clear I'm not a C
    developer and didn't contribute some fancy new feature. However, I do love Postgres
    and wanted to contribute. Here's my journey and what I learned along the way.

- en: I had an idea for a docs patch while I was talking to Stephen Frost about some
    research and writing I was doing about [HOT updates and fill factor](https://www.crunchydata.com/blog/postgres-performance-boost-hot-updates-and-fill-factor).
    A recent update to HOT updates meant HOT could be compatible with BRIN. And while
    the [HOT readme was up to date,](https://git.postgresql.org/gitweb/?p=postgresql.git;a=blob;f=src/backend/access/heap/README.HOT)
    the main [PostgreSQL docs](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/storage-hot.html)
    were missing a reference to BRIN indexes, as of Postgres 16, allowing HOT updates.
    There’s not a ton of missing Postgres docs, so this felt like my chance to put
    in a teensy weensy little patch in, and as a side bonus I’d have Stephen’s help.

- en: PostgreSQL docs and source code are all packaged together. So what you see at
    [https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/)
    is also in the main code repo. This is public and online at [https://github.com/postgres/postgres](https://github.com/postgres/postgres).
    This code repo is just a mirror of the code, so it doesn't actually run anything
    and you can’t submit PRs against it. In fact, PostgreSQL doesn’t work with a pull
    request workflow at all. They work with the concept of a patch file.

    to a mailing list? So yeah, the real magic happens in PostgreSQL through [a mailing
    list](https://www.postgresql.org/list/). While, it’s not the fanciest new thing
    out there, email does have the ability to reach pretty much every person on the
    planet. It is surprisingly efficient at delivering the same information to a variety
    of people and letting them consume that the time and place they feel is best.

- en: To be clear, I read zero PostgreSQL mailing lists currently. I prefer the excellent
    and succinct curation done by Cooper Press’ [Postgres weekly](https://postgresweekly.com/).
    If you want to level up your Postgres my colleague [Craig](https://twitter.com/craigkerstiens)
    encourages people all the time to subscribe to the lists and simply follow along.
    The pgsql-general mailing list is more for general Postgres usage, tips, troubleshooting,
    where as pgsql-hackers is where development and contribution happens. There is
    also a pgsql-docs mailing list intended for discussion of doc changes, but once
    a patch exists it needs to make its way to -hackers since that’s where you can
    create a commitfest record for it. Even if you don’t want to contribute to Postgres
    the pgsql-hackers mailing list can be a great to level up your broader engineering
    skills and knowledge Postgres internals.

    so [discussions of patches](https://postgr.es/m/CABoUFXRjisr58Ct_3VsFEdQx+fJeQTWTdJnM7XAp=8MUbtoa9A@mail.gmail.com)
    are viewable, indexed by google, and searchable. You don’t have to keep track
    of everything in your inbox.

- en: Ok, so you’ve submitted this patch and hoping someone will test it. Anyone on
    the hackers list might pull in your patch. Testing a patch is as simple as creating
    a local branch and adding a patch file. Postgres also has [regression tests](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/regress-run.html)
    that should be run against patches. Since mine was a docs patch, I didn’t bother
    with this. If you’re changing code, you should do this, and the reviewers will
    as well.

- en: Patches are generally also added to an upcoming [commitfest](https://commitfest.postgresql.org/).
    Commitfest is an ongoing patch review list to keep track of reviewers, committers,
    and activity for certain months out of the year. This is a little tracking system
    that Postgres uses to make sure nothing gets lost on the email threads. The commitfest
    system also drives the [automated patch testing system](http://cfbot.cputube.org),
    know as the CF bot. This automated test will run on any patch that's been added
    to the commitfest app. This will ensure the latest version of your patch will
    be tested against the latest version of the Postgres code.

    is waiting on bated breath for feedback. It could be good, it could be horribly
    embarrassing, there’s just no way of telling. For all situations of patch review,
    thick skin is your friend here. Everyone wants this to be the best and most accurate
    software possible. Patch feedback might seem overwhelming and extremely specific,
    but keep in mind, this is a 30 year old project. It’s the most popular community
    run database in the world. The community has quite a standard and a legacy of
    excellence to uphold.

- en: So for your patch to actually make it into the codebase, [one of the current
    Postgres committers](https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Committers) has to take
    up your patch and get it committed to the code base. Commits happen in a git based,
    private repo. In my case, one of the committers saw the patch and the discussion,
    offered his own suggestions, and asked for agreement. Once we all agreed, it was
    committed with a [commit id and note](https://git.postgresql.org/gitweb/?p=postgresql.git;a=commit;h=7a9328e8e40534fb4de41b4ac152e3c6989d84e7).

    ‘master’ branch of PostgreSQL is generally open for commits in the development
    version. So master right now is open for version 17, since that will go into public
    beta this spring. If you get a commit in before the public beta is released, your
    code will be in that version.

    also appear in one of the version stable releases. For example, my patch is applicable
    to version 16, so it is also in REL_16_STABLE. 16.2 is the current minor version,
    there will be a new minor point release for 16.3\. When 16.3 is out, my docs update
    will appear there, since the docs site runs on the current point release. See
    [Postgres’ roadmap for planned releases](https://www.postgresql.org/developer/roadmap/).

    has been for me in the last few years. I’m happy to be riding a wave where PostgreSQL
    itself and their associated member organizations like [pgUS](https://postgresql.us/)
    and [PostgreSQL Europe](https://www.postgresql.eu/), are making inclusivity and
    diversity a priority. I’ve been easily brought into the fold, encouraged, and
    helped along by many of my co-workers and community members. I should mention
    a particular shout out to Craig Kerstiens, Stephen Frost, and David Christensen
    for their support in my PostgreSQL endeavors.
