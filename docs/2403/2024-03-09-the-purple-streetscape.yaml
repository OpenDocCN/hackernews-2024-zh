    These lamps emitted light around 400nm, beyond violet light, thus the term ultraviolet.
    This light is close to, but not quite in, the visible spectrum, which is ideal
    for observing the effect of fluorescence. Fluorescence is a fascinating but also
    mundane physical phenomenon in which many materials will absorb light, becoming
    excited, and then re-emit it as they relax. The process is not completely efficient,
    so the re-emited light is longer in wavelength than the absorbed light.

    the fluorescence is far brighter, to the human eye, than the ultraviolet light

    leads to a bit of a misconception that ultraviolet light is required. Not at all,
    fluorescent materials will emit just about any light at a slightly lower wavelength.
    The emitted light is relatively weak, though, and under broad spectrum lighting
    is unlikely to stand out against the ambient lighting. Fluorescence always occurs,
    it''s just much more visible under a light source that humans can''t see.'

    construction of LEDs that emit UV light turns out to be quite difficult. There
    are now options on the market, but only relatively recently, and they run a considerable
    price premium compared to visible wavelength LEDs. The vast majority of "LED blacklights"
    are not actually blacklights; they don't actually emit UV. They're just blue.
    Human eyes aren't so sensitive to blue, especially the narrow emission of blue
    LEDs, and so these blue "blacklights" work well enough for showing fluorescence,
    although not as well as a "real" blacklight (still typically gas discharge).

    UV already barely has enough energy to have much of a sanitizing effect and blue
    LEDs have none at all. For sanitizing purposes you need short wave UV, or UV-C,
    which has so much energy that it is almost ionizing radiation. The trouble, of
    course, is that this energy damages most biological things, including us. UV-C
    lights can quickly cause mild (but very unpleasant) eye damage called flashburn

    LEDs are largely monochromatic lighting sources, they emit a single wavelength
    that results in very poor color rendering, which is both aesthetically unpleasing

    LEDs of multiple colors to produce white output, there's another technique that

    LED 以产生白光输出，但还有另一种更便宜、更节能、并且产生更高质量光的技术。今天廉价而高质量的 LED 灯光得益于磷光涂层的应用。

    Phosphorescence is actually a closely related phenomenon to fluorescence, but

- en: Blue LEDs are the most energy efficient, so a typical white LED light uses blue
    LEDs coated in a phosphor that absorbs a portion of the blue light and re-emits
    it at longer wavelengths. The resulting spectrum, the combination of some of the

- en: Incidentally, one of the properties of phosphorescence that differentiates it
    from fluorescence is that phosphors take a while to "relax" back to their lower
    energy state. A phosphor will continue to glow after the energy that excited it
    is gone. This effect has long been employed for "glow in the dark" materials that
    continue to glow softly for an extended period of time after the room goes dark.
    During the Cold War, the Civil Defense Administration recommended outlining stair
    treads and doors with such phosphorescent tape so that you could more safely navigate
    your home during a blackout. The same idea is still employed aboard aircraft and
    ships, and I suppose you could still do it to your house, it would be fun.

  zh: 顺便提一下，荧光与磷光的一个区别是，磷光体需要一段时间才能“放松”到较低能量状态。能量激发它的来源消失后，磷光体仍会继续发光。这种效应长期以来被应用在“夜光”材料上，使其在房间变暗后仍然能持续微弱发光。在冷战期间，民防管理局建议使用这种磷光带来轮廓化楼梯踏板和门，以便在停电时更安全地在家中行走。同样的想法仍然在飞机和船只上使用，我想你也可以在家里试试，这会很有趣。

    and the lights are emitting the natural spectrum of their LEDs rather than the
    "adjusted" spectrum produced by the phosphor. The exact reason for this failure
    doesn't seem to have been publicized, but judging by the apparently rapid onset
    most people think the phosphor is delaminating and falling off of the LEDs rather
    than slowly burning away or undergoing some sort of corrosion. They may have simply
    not used a very good glue.

- en: 'So we have a technical explanation: white LED streetlights are not white LEDs
    but blue LEDs with phosphor conversion. If the phosphor somehow fails or comes
    off, their spectrum shifts towards deep blue. Some combination of remaining phosphor
    on the lights and environmental conditions (we are not used to seeing large areas
