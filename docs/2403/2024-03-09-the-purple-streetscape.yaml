    They're certainly in evidence here in Albuquerque, where Coal through downtown
    has turned almost entirely to mood lighting. Explanations vary. When I first saw
    the phenomenon, I thought of fixtures that combined RGB elements and thought perhaps
    one of the color channels had failed.

- en: Others on the internet offer more involved explanations. "A black light surveillance
    network," one conspiracist calls them, as he shows his mushroom-themed blacklight
    poster fluorescing on the side of a highway. I remain unclear on what exactly
    a shadowy cabal would gain from installing blacklights across North America, but
    I am nonetheless charmed by his fluorescent fingerpainting demonstration. The
    topic of "blacklight" is a somewhat complex one with LEDs.

- en: Historically, "blacklight" had referred to long-wave UV lamps, also called UV-A.
    These lamps emitted light around 400nm, beyond violet light, thus the term ultraviolet.
    This light is close to, but not quite in, the visible spectrum, which is ideal
    for observing the effect of fluorescence. Fluorescence is a fascinating but also
    mundane physical phenomenon in which many materials will absorb light, becoming
    excited, and then re-emit it as they relax. The process is not completely efficient,
    so the re-emited light is longer in wavelength than the absorbed light.

- en: 'Because of this loss of energy, a fluorescent material excited by a blacklight
    will emit light down in the visible spectrum. The effect seems a bit like magic:
    the fluorescence is far brighter, to the human eye, than the ultraviolet light
    that incited it. The trouble is that the common use of UV light to show fluorescence
    leads to a bit of a misconception that ultraviolet light is required. Not at all,
    fluorescent materials will emit just about any light at a slightly lower wavelength.
    The emitted light is relatively weak, though, and under broad spectrum lighting
    is unlikely to stand out against the ambient lighting. Fluorescence always occurs,
    it''s just much more visible under a light source that humans can''t see.'

- en: When we consider LEDs, though, there is an economic aspect to consider. The
    construction of LEDs that emit UV light turns out to be quite difficult. There
    are now options on the market, but only relatively recently, and they run a considerable
    price premium compared to visible wavelength LEDs. The vast majority of "LED blacklights"
    are not actually blacklights; they don't actually emit UV. They're just blue.
    Human eyes aren't so sensitive to blue, especially the narrow emission of blue
    LEDs, and so these blue "blacklights" work well enough for showing fluorescence,
    although not as well as a "real" blacklight (still typically gas discharge).

- en: This was mostly a minor detail of theatrical lighting until COVID, when some
    combination of unknowing buyers and unscrupulous sellers lead to a wave of people
    using blue LEDs in an attempt to sanitize things. That doesn't work, long-wave
    UV already barely has enough energy to have much of a sanitizing effect and blue
    LEDs have none at all. For sanitizing purposes you need short wave UV, or UV-C,
    which has so much energy that it is almost ionizing radiation. The trouble, of
    course, is that this energy damages most biological things, including us. UV-C
    lights can quickly cause mild (but very unpleasant) eye damage called flashburn
    or "welder's eye," and more serious exposure can cause permanent damage to your
    eyes and skin. Funny, then, that all the people waving blue LEDs over their groceries
    on Instagram reels were at least saving themselves from an unpleasant learning
    experience.

- en: You can probably see how this all ties back to streetlights. The purple streetlights
    are not "blacklights," but the clear fluorescence of our friend's psychedelic
    art tells us that they are emitting energy mostly at the short end of the visible
    spectrum, allowing the longer wave light emitted by the poster to appear inexplicably
    bright to our eyes. We are apparently looking at some sort of blue LED.

- en: Those familiar with modern LED lighting probably easily see what's happening.
    LEDs are largely monochromatic lighting sources, they emit a single wavelength
    that results in very poor color rendering, which is both aesthetically unpleasing
    and produces poor perception for drivers. While some fixtures do indeed combine
    LEDs of multiple colors to produce white output, there's another technique that
    is less expensive, more energy efficient, and produces better quality light. Today's
    inexpensive, good quality LED lights have been enabled by phosphor coatings.

- en: 'Here''s the idea: LEDs of a single color illuminate a phosphorous material.
    Phosphorescence is actually a closely related phenomenon to fluorescence, but
    involves kicking an electron up to a different spin state. Fewer materials exhibit
    this effect than fluorescence, but chemists have devised synthetic phosphors that
    can sort of "rearrange" light energy within the spectrum.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Blue LEDs are the most energy efficient, so a typical white LED light uses blue
    LEDs coated in a phosphor that absorbs a portion of the blue light and re-emits
    it at longer wavelengths. The resulting spectrum, the combination of some of the
    blue light passing through and red and green light emitted by the phosphor, is
    a high-CRI white light ideal for street lighting.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Incidentally, one of the properties of phosphorescence that differentiates it
    from fluorescence is that phosphors take a while to "relax" back to their lower
    energy state. A phosphor will continue to glow after the energy that excited it
    is gone. This effect has long been employed for "glow in the dark" materials that
    continue to glow softly for an extended period of time after the room goes dark.
    During the Cold War, the Civil Defense Administration recommended outlining stair
    treads and doors with such phosphorescent tape so that you could more safely navigate
    your home during a blackout. The same idea is still employed aboard aircraft and
    ships, and I suppose you could still do it to your house, it would be fun.

- en: Phosphor-conversion white LEDs use phosphors that minimize this effect but they
    still exhibit it. Turn off a white LED light in a dark room and you will probably
    notice that it continues to glow dimly for a short time. You are observing the
    phosphor slowly relaxing.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So what of the purple streetlights? The phosphor has failed, at least partially,
    and the lights are emitting the natural spectrum of their LEDs rather than the
    "adjusted" spectrum produced by the phosphor. The exact reason for this failure
    doesn't seem to have been publicized, but judging by the apparently rapid onset
    most people think the phosphor is delaminating and falling off of the LEDs rather
    than slowly burning away or undergoing some sort of corrosion. They may have simply
    not used a very good glue.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'So we have a technical explanation: white LED streetlights are not white LEDs
    but blue LEDs with phosphor conversion. If the phosphor somehow fails or comes
    off, their spectrum shifts towards deep blue. Some combination of remaining phosphor
    on the lights and environmental conditions (we are not used to seeing large areas
    under monochromatic blue light) causes this to come off as an eery purple.'

    across so many cities are demonstrating the same failure at around the same time?

    by Acuity Brands. Based in Atlanta, Acuity is a hundred-year-old industrial conglomerate
    that originally focused on linens and janitorial supplies. In 1969, though, Acuity
    acquired Lithonia: one of the United States'' largest manufacturers of area lighting.
    Acuity gained a lighting division, and it was on the war path. Through a huge
    number of acquisitions, everything from age-old area lighting giants like Holophane
    to VC-funded networked lighting companies have become part of Acuity.'

    of GE (they recently sold their entire lighting division to a consumer home automation
    company). Directories of street lighting manufacturers now list Acuity followed
    by a list of brands Acuity owns. Their dominant competitor for traditional street
    lighting are probably Cree and Cooper (part of Eaton), but both are well behind
    Acuity in municipal sales.

- en: Starting around 2017, Acuity started to manufacture defective lights. The exact
    nature of the defect is unclear, but it seems to cause abrupt failure of the phosphor
    after around five years. And here we are, over five years later, with purple streets.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The situation is not quite as bad as it sounds. Acuity offered a long warranty
    on their street lighting, and the affected lights are still covered. Acuity is
    sending contractors to replace defective lights at their expensive, but they have
    to coordinate with street lighting operators to identify defective lights and
    schedule the work. It's a long process. Many cities have over a thousand lights
    to replace, but finding them is a problem on its own.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Most cities have invested in some sort of smart streetlighting solution. The
    most common approach is a module that plugs into the standard photocell receptacle
    on the light and both controls the light and reports energy use over a municipal
    LTE network. These modules can automatically identify many failure modes based
    on changes on power consumption. The problem is that the phosphor failure is completely
    nonelectrical, so the faulty lights can't be located by energy monitoring.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So, while I can't truly rule out the possibility of a blacklight surveillance
    network, I'd suggest you report purple lights to your city or electrical utility.
    They're likely already working with Acuity on a replacement campaign, but they
    may not know the exact scale of the problem yet.

    LED lighting: flashing. LED lights use a constant current power supply (often
    called a driver in this context) that regulates the voltage applied to the LEDs
    to achieve their rated current. Unfortunately, several failure modes can cause
    the driver to continuously cycle. Consider the common case of an LED module that
    has failed in such a way that it shorts at high temperature. The driver will turn
    on until the faulty module gets warm enough and the driver turns off again on
    current protection. The process repeats indefinitely. Some drivers have a "soft
    start" feature and some failure modes cause current to rise beyond limits over
    time, so it''s not unusual for these faulty lights to fade in before shutting
    off.'

- en: It's actually a very similar situation to the cycling that gas discharge street
    lighting used to show, but as is the way of electronics, it happens faster. Aged
    sodium bulbs would often cause the ballast to hit its current limit over the span
    of perhaps five minutes, cycling the light on and off. Now it often happens twice
    in a second.

    guess that lightning had struck, creating a transient that damaged all of them
    at once. It felt like a silent rave, only a little color could have made it better.
    Unfortunately they were RAB, not Acuity, and the phosphor was holding on.
