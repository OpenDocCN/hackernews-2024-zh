    They're certainly in evidence here in Albuquerque, where Coal through downtown
    has turned almost entirely to mood lighting. Explanations vary. When I first saw
    the phenomenon, I thought of fixtures that combined RGB elements and thought perhaps
    one of the color channels had failed.

    network," one conspiracist calls them, as he shows his mushroom-themed blacklight
    poster fluorescing on the side of a highway. I remain unclear on what exactly
    a shadowy cabal would gain from installing blacklights across North America, but
    I am nonetheless charmed by his fluorescent fingerpainting demonstration. The
    topic of "blacklight" is a somewhat complex one with LEDs.

- en: Historically, "blacklight" had referred to long-wave UV lamps, also called UV-A.
    These lamps emitted light around 400nm, beyond violet light, thus the term ultraviolet.
    This light is close to, but not quite in, the visible spectrum, which is ideal
    for observing the effect of fluorescence. Fluorescence is a fascinating but also
    mundane physical phenomenon in which many materials will absorb light, becoming
    excited, and then re-emit it as they relax. The process is not completely efficient,
    so the re-emited light is longer in wavelength than the absorbed light.

    will emit light down in the visible spectrum. The effect seems a bit like magic:
    the fluorescence is far brighter, to the human eye, than the ultraviolet light
    that incited it. The trouble is that the common use of UV light to show fluorescence
    leads to a bit of a misconception that ultraviolet light is required. Not at all,
    fluorescent materials will emit just about any light at a slightly lower wavelength.
    The emitted light is relatively weak, though, and under broad spectrum lighting
    is unlikely to stand out against the ambient lighting. Fluorescence always occurs,
    it''s just much more visible under a light source that humans can''t see.'

    construction of LEDs that emit UV light turns out to be quite difficult. There
    are now options on the market, but only relatively recently, and they run a considerable
    price premium compared to visible wavelength LEDs. The vast majority of "LED blacklights"
    are not actually blacklights; they don't actually emit UV. They're just blue.
    Human eyes aren't so sensitive to blue, especially the narrow emission of blue
    LEDs, and so these blue "blacklights" work well enough for showing fluorescence,
    although not as well as a "real" blacklight (still typically gas discharge).

    combination of unknowing buyers and unscrupulous sellers lead to a wave of people
    using blue LEDs in an attempt to sanitize things. That doesn't work, long-wave
    UV already barely has enough energy to have much of a sanitizing effect and blue
    LEDs have none at all. For sanitizing purposes you need short wave UV, or UV-C,
    which has so much energy that it is almost ionizing radiation. The trouble, of
    course, is that this energy damages most biological things, including us. UV-C
    lights can quickly cause mild (but very unpleasant) eye damage called flashburn
    or "welder's eye," and more serious exposure can cause permanent damage to your
    eyes and skin. Funny, then, that all the people waving blue LEDs over their groceries
    on Instagram reels were at least saving themselves from an unpleasant learning
    experience.

    are not "blacklights," but the clear fluorescence of our friend's psychedelic
    art tells us that they are emitting energy mostly at the short end of the visible
    spectrum, allowing the longer wave light emitted by the poster to appear inexplicably
    bright to our eyes. We are apparently looking at some sort of blue LED.

    LEDs are largely monochromatic lighting sources, they emit a single wavelength
    that results in very poor color rendering, which is both aesthetically unpleasing
    and produces poor perception for drivers. While some fixtures do indeed combine
    LEDs of multiple colors to produce white output, there's another technique that
    is less expensive, more energy efficient, and produces better quality light. Today's
    inexpensive, good quality LED lights have been enabled by phosphor coatings.

    Phosphorescence is actually a closely related phenomenon to fluorescence, but
    involves kicking an electron up to a different spin state. Fewer materials exhibit
    this effect than fluorescence, but chemists have devised synthetic phosphors that
    can sort of "rearrange" light energy within the spectrum.'

- en: Blue LEDs are the most energy efficient, so a typical white LED light uses blue
    LEDs coated in a phosphor that absorbs a portion of the blue light and re-emits
    it at longer wavelengths. The resulting spectrum, the combination of some of the
    blue light passing through and red and green light emitted by the phosphor, is
    a high-CRI white light ideal for street lighting.

  zh: 蓝色LED是最节能的，因此典型的白色LED灯使用涂有磷光的蓝色LED，磷光吸收部分蓝光并将其重新辐射为较长波长的光。由此产生的光谱，蓝光的一部分通过并由磷光发射的红光和绿光组合起来，是一种适合街道照明的高CRI白光。
- en: Incidentally, one of the properties of phosphorescence that differentiates it
    from fluorescence is that phosphors take a while to "relax" back to their lower
    energy state. A phosphor will continue to glow after the energy that excited it
    is gone. This effect has long been employed for "glow in the dark" materials that
    continue to glow softly for an extended period of time after the room goes dark.
    During the Cold War, the Civil Defense Administration recommended outlining stair
    treads and doors with such phosphorescent tape so that you could more safely navigate
    your home during a blackout. The same idea is still employed aboard aircraft and
    ships, and I suppose you could still do it to your house, it would be fun.

  zh: 顺便提一下，荧光与磷光的一个区别是，磷光体需要一段时间才能“放松”到较低能量状态。能量激发它的来源消失后，磷光体仍会继续发光。这种效应长期以来被应用在“夜光”材料上，使其在房间变暗后仍然能持续微弱发光。在冷战期间，民防管理局建议使用这种磷光带来轮廓化楼梯踏板和门，以便在停电时更安全地在家中行走。同样的想法仍然在飞机和船只上使用，我想你也可以在家里试试，这会很有趣。
- en: Phosphor-conversion white LEDs use phosphors that minimize this effect but they
    still exhibit it. Turn off a white LED light in a dark room and you will probably
    notice that it continues to glow dimly for a short time. You are observing the
    phosphor slowly relaxing.

- en: So what of the purple streetlights? The phosphor has failed, at least partially,
    and the lights are emitting the natural spectrum of their LEDs rather than the
    "adjusted" spectrum produced by the phosphor. The exact reason for this failure
    doesn't seem to have been publicized, but judging by the apparently rapid onset
    most people think the phosphor is delaminating and falling off of the LEDs rather
    than slowly burning away or undergoing some sort of corrosion. They may have simply
    not used a very good glue.

  zh: 那么紫色的街灯怎么办？磷光部分失败，至少部分失败，灯在发射其LED的自然光谱，而不是磷光产生的“调整”光谱。关于这种故障的确切原因似乎并未公开，但根据明显快速发生的情况，大多数人认为是磷光层剥离并脱落，而不是缓慢燃烧或经历某种形式的腐蚀。它们可能只是没有使用非常好的胶水。
- en: 'So we have a technical explanation: white LED streetlights are not white LEDs
    but blue LEDs with phosphor conversion. If the phosphor somehow fails or comes
    off, their spectrum shifts towards deep blue. Some combination of remaining phosphor
    on the lights and environmental conditions (we are not used to seeing large areas
    under monochromatic blue light) causes this to come off as an eery purple.'

  zh: 因此，我们有一个技术解释：白色LED路灯实际上不是白色LED，而是蓝色LED加磷光转换。如果磷光某种方式失败或脱落，它们的光谱会向深蓝色偏移。灯上残留的磷光和环境条件（我们不习惯看到大面积单色蓝光）导致其呈现出一种怪异的紫色。

    acquired Lithonia: one of the United States'' largest manufacturers of area lighting.

    LED lighting: flashing. LED lights use a constant current power supply (often

    to achieve their rated current. Unfortunately, several failure modes can cause
    the driver to continuously cycle. Consider the common case of an LED module that
    has failed in such a way that it shorts at high temperature. The driver will turn
    on until the faulty module gets warm enough and the driver turns off again on
    current protection. The process repeats indefinitely. Some drivers have a "soft

    lighting used to show, but as is the way of electronics, it happens faster. Aged
