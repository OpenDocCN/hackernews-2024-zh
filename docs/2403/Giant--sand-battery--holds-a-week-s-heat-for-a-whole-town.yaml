- en: A new industrial-scale 'sand battery' has been announced for Finland, which
    packs 1 MW of power and a capacity of up to 100 MWh of thermal energy for use
    during those cold polar winters. The new battery will be about 10 times bigger
    than a [pilot plant](https://newatlas.com/energy/sand-battery-polar-night/) that’s
    been running since 2022.

- en: The sand battery, developed by Polar Night Energy, is a clever concept. Basically,
    it’s a big steel silo of sand (or a similar solid material) that’s warmed up through
    a heat exchanger buried in the center, using excess electricity from the grid
    – say, that generated during a spike from renewable sources, when it’s cheap.

    loss, before being extracted as heat on demand. This could theoretically be converted
    back into electricity, although with some energy loss. But Polar Night says that
    the most efficient method is to just use the heat itself.

    heating system, which shares heat produced from industry or energy production
    through the community. Networks of pipes carry this heat as hot water or steam
    to warm up houses, buildings, even swimming pools. In this case, the new sand
    battery would be trialed in the district heating system of the Finnish municipality
    of Pornainen, run by a company called Loviisan Lämpö.

- en: This new sand battery is expected to stand 13 m (42.7 ft) tall and 15 m (49.2
    ft) wide, providing an output power of 1 MW and a capacity of 100 MWh. That, the
    companies claim, equates to a week’s worth of Pornainen’s heat demands in winter,
    or a month’s worth in summer. By comparison, Polar Night’s previous sand battery
    stands 4 x 7 m (13 x 23 ft), for a nominal power rating of 100 kW and a capacity
    of 8 MWh.

- en: The new battery should also reduce the carbon dioxide emissions of the district
    heating system by 160 tonnes per year, translating to an almost 70% reduction.
    The sand itself will also be sustainably sourced – it’ll consist of crushed soapstone,
    which is a manufacturing byproduct of another local industry. This material can
    apparently conduct heat even better than regular old sand.

- en: While sand batteries might not find wide outside of areas that use district
    heating, they could still be one useful tool in a climate change toolbox that
    needs to be as diverse as possible. Sand batteries might join other grid-scale
    storage options like [lithium-ion](https://newatlas.com/energy/worlds-biggest-battery-tesla-expansion/),
    [gravity](https://newatlas.com/energy/gravitricity-gravity-renewable-energy-storage-system/),
    [molten salt](https://newatlas.com/mit-molten-salt-battery-membrane/53085/), [iron-air](https://newatlas.com/energy/form-energy-iron-air-battery-bezos/)
    or [flow batteries](https://newatlas.com/energy/symmetrical-flow-battery-grid-scale-storage/).
