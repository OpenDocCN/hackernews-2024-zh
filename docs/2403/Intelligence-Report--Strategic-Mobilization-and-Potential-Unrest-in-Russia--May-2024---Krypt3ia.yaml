    forums focused on organizing a nationwide strike in May 2024\. The movement aims
    to destabilize the current government and challenge President Vladimir Putin’s
    regime through economic disruption and peaceful protest. Drawing parallels with
    the Euromaidan protests, participants discuss leveraging the critical timing before
    the U.S. presidential elections in November 2024 to catalyze change. This document
    assesses the potential risks, motivations, and implications of this planned action
    for stakeholders within and outside Russia.

    of the Current Crisis,”*** posted on a darknet forum by a user named Leviathan.
    It outlines a comprehensive strategy inspired by historical precedents of peaceful
    resistance, suggesting a mass economic strike as a means to exert pressure on
    the government. The plan is set to coincide with a period perceived as opportune
    for action, given the upcoming U.S. elections and the current geopolitical climate.

    dissent within Russia, highlighting a strategic push towards challenging the current
    regime through organized, non-violent resistance. While the movement’s success
    is contingent on widespread support and the ability to circumvent state surveillance
    and suppression, it underscores a critical juncture in Russia’s socio-political
    landscape.

- en: The discussed May 2024 strike plan, surfaced in a darknet forum, suggests an
    attempt at civil mobilization against Putin’s regime. Currently, this information
    is assessed with low to medium confidence as a serious movement, primarily due
    to the lack of corroboration from other sources or visible rallying around this
    cause beyond the initial posting. While the precise outcome of such an initiative
    remains highly uncertain, the post itself could be indicative of simmering tensions
    and a segment of the population’s willingness to explore collective action for
    change. Given the opaque nature of the source and the forum’s environment, stakeholders
    are advised to maintain vigilance and prepare for various potential developments,
    keeping in mind the preliminary status of these discussions as the situation continues
    to evolve.
