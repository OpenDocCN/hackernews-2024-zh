    a 120-foot-long bar of Cor-Ten steel that was once set in a plaza in New York’s
    Financial District, is today remembered as one of the most reviled works of public

- en: Yet for the most part, critics have spoken hyperbolically of Serra’s work, viewing
    it as a game-changing oeuvre that succeeded in pushing sculpture into new conceptual
    realms. He contended with the ways in which an artwork not only exists in space
    but reorients it, shaping how viewers approach the area around them. Accordingly,
    his sculptures variously restrict, warp, and block the spaces viewers inhabit,
    forcing them to move through galleries in ways they may not normally.

  zh: 然而，在很大程度上，评论家们对Serra的作品评价颇高，认为它们是一部改变游戏规则的杰作，成功将雕塑推向新的概念境界。他探讨了艺术作品不仅存在于空间中，还重新定位它，塑造了观众如何接近周围环境的方式。因此，他的雕塑作品通过各种方式限制、扭曲和阻挡观众所占据的空间，迫使他们以非常规的方式穿越画廊。
- en: “I think that sculpture, if it has any potential at all, has the potential to
    create its own place and space, and to work in contradiction to the spaces and
    places where it is created in this sense,” Serra once said. “I am interested in
    work where the artist is a maker of ‘anti-environment’ which takes its own place
    or makes its own situation, or divides or declares its own area.”

- en: Serra’s work is cold, unforgiving, and austere. Nearly all of it contains no
    psychological content, no figural imagery. It seems totally opposed to its viewer,
    who must accept the power differential between a human and a steel block weighing
    tons, then either surrender to it or fight back by ignoring these pieces altogether—which
    is hard to do, given their size.

- en: It is the kind of art that has become a shorthand for the masculine bravado
    of many Minimalists. (Asked if he thought his work was feminine, Serra once said,
    “It’s not feminine.”) For that reason, it was sometimes targeted by feminist critics
    during the 1970s. Cindy Nemser once claimed that she had tried to interview Serra,
    and that he declined her request, telling her to “fuck off.” She published word
    of that in a 1972 essay called “Egomania and the Male Artist.” The artist David
    Hammons once spoofed the macho quality of Serra’s art with the performance *Pissed
    Off* (1981), for which he urinated on one of Serra’s public steel sculptures in
    New York.

  zh: 这种艺术形式已经成为许多极简主义者男性豪放气概的简略代表。面对被问及他是否认为自己的作品具有女性特质时，Serra 曾说：“它不是女性化的。”因此，它有时在
    1970 年代被女权主义评论家们批评。Cindy Nemser 曾声称她曾试图采访 Serra，但他拒绝了她的请求，并告诉她“滚开”。她在 1972 年的一篇名为《自大狂与男性艺术家》的文章中公布了这件事。艺术家
    David Hammons 曾在表演 *Pissed Off*（1981）中讽刺了 Serra 艺术的男性气质，他在纽约一座 Serra 的公共钢雕塑上撒尿。
- en: These critiques did little to tarnish Serra’s reputation. He has proven massively
    influential to generations of artists. He even appeared in Matthew Barney’s 2002

- en: Richard Serra was born on November 2, 1938, in San Francisco. Some Minimalists
    have discussed their artistic styles as being rooted in experiences formative
    to their development. In Serra’s case, many have divined a possible connection
    between his sculptures formed from industrial materials and the ships that he
    could see from the windows of his family’s home. When Serra was 5, he visited
    the shipyard where his father worked; that, too, has become crucial to Serra lore.

  zh: Richard Serra 生于 1938 年 11 月 2 日，出生于旧金山。一些极简主义者讨论了他们的艺术风格与他们发展过程中的经历有关。在 Serra
    的情况下，许多人猜测他的工业材料制成的雕塑与他家中窗外可以看到的船只之间可能存在联系。当 Serra 5 岁时，他参观了他父亲工作的造船厂；这也成为了 Serra
    传说中的重要一部分。
- en: He attended the University of California, Santa Barbara as an undergraduate,
    finishing with a degree in English literature, and then attended Yale University’s
    graduate art program, having already taken art history courses there. At Yale,
    he played a trick on Robert Rauschenberg in which he gave the artist a box that
    secretly contained a chicken, which proceeded to make noise and defecate once
    let loose. Serra was ejected from the program for two weeks. “They told me I wasn’t
    ‘polite to guests,‘“ Serra recalled. “How can they kick you out of art school?”

  zh: 他曾就读于加州大学圣巴巴拉分校本科，获得英语文学学位，然后进入耶鲁大学的研究生艺术课程，在那里已经修过艺术史课程。在耶鲁，他曾开过一个对 Robert
    Rauschenberg 的恶作剧，给这位艺术家一个盒子，里面偷偷藏着一只鸡，一放出来就叽叽喳喳地叫并且拉屎。Serra 被该项目开除了两周。“他们告诉我我对客人不礼貌，”Serra
    回忆道。“他们怎么能把你赶出艺术学校呢？”
- en: Serra had set out to become a painter, then became disillusioned with the medium,
    which at the time was still associated with Abstract Expressionism and transcendence.
    Serra, wanting nothing to do with any of that, ended up moving in a less traditional
    route upon graduation from Yale in 1964, working with composer Philip Glass and
    staging a show composed solely of animals, only some of which were still alive.

    年从耶鲁大学毕业后，选择了一条不那么传统的道路，与作曲家 Philip Glass 合作，并策划了一场仅由动物组成的展览，其中只有部分动物仍然存活。
- en: 'His art of the late ’60s has been aligned with a movement known as Process
    art, which shifted the focus away from the completed art object, toward the means
    by which it was created. *Verb List* (1967–68) is a crucial artwork of that movement:
    it features, in carefully scrawled cursive, 54 verbs, ending with “to continue.”
    There were also pieces such as *Splashing* (1968), for which Serra threw molten
    lead against a wall of New York’s Leo Castelli Gallery. In 1969, Jasper Johns
    invited Serra to do a “splashing” work in his New York studio, as sure a sign
    as any that Serra’s star had fully ascended.'

    Castelli画廊的墙壁上。1969年，贾斯珀·约翰斯邀请塞拉在他的纽约工作室进行“溅泼”工作，这无疑表明塞拉的明星已经完全升起。

    1973 video *Television Delivers People*, made with Carlota Fay Schoolman, which

- en: These works differed greatly from Abstract Expressionist painting, which its
    makers believed to be imbued with all sorts of lofty ideas about the state of
    humanity. By contrast, Serra’s art seemed to be all about surfaces—they were conceptually
    driven, their content existing in the form of ideas that were appended to these
    objects. “Where else would content come from if not from the experience of perceiving
    the work,” Serra once said.

    spaces. In 1971, he created his first rolled steel work, and from there would
    continue to rely on the material for works such as *Circuit*, staged at the 1977
    edition of the Documenta art festival in Kassel, Germany. When it was installed
    in the German city of Bochum two years later, locals were not happy.

- en: Their ire would prove no match for what Serra would experience when *Tilted
    Arc* was installed in Manhattan’s Foley Federal Plaza. The work was commissioned
    by a government body, and its perceived ugliness led 1,300 government workers

- en: But the public was not persuaded, and the case even made it to court. A judge
    ruled that the piece would have to go—it made it impossible to fully surveil the
    government buildings it partially concealed. Serra then sued the United States
    General Services Office, claiming that his right to free speech had been violated.
    His claim was denied, and the sculpture was finally hauled away in 1989\. The
    *Wall Street Journal*’s story about the removal bore the headline “Good Riddance.”
    Today, the sculpture resides in storage.

    Serra’s art, it did not keep him from sculpting increasingly large steel works.
    Installing these works has not always been a safe endeavor. In 1971, a Serra sculpture
    weighing more than 5,000 pounds fell on an installer at the Walker Art Center,
    killing him. And in 1988, two workers were pinned for several minutes beneath

- en: Despite the evident danger of installing Serra works, many have not shown any
    fear of getting up-close to them. A number for epic steel works from the past
