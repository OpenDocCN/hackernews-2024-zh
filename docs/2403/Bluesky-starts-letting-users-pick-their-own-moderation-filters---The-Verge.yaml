    The [social platform announced](https://bsky.social/about/blog/03-12-2024-stackable-moderation)
    that it’s open-sourcing its moderation tool, [called Ozone](https://github.com/bluesky-social/ozone-ui),
    to let developers create additional moderation services that can be selected by
    users.

- en: Bluesky already has [a team dedicated to content moderation](/2024/1/16/24040471/bluesky-hires-its-own-moderators-directly),
    along with its own set of rules users have to follow. However, the new system
    will let users expand what’s moderated to their liking, allowing them to subscribe
    to additional moderation services that label, annotate, or hide certain types
    of posts.

- en: As an example, Bluesky says someone could use Ozone to create a moderation service
    that specifically blocks images of spiders. A user could then subscribe to that
    service to remove photos of spiders from their feeds. They can also report any
    spider images that fall through the cracks, allowing the moderation service’s
    creator to review them.

    experience to create the kind of community you want,” Bluesky CEO Jay Graber tells
    *The Verge* in an upcoming episode of *Decoder*. “Beyond that, you’re going to
    be able to mix and match these in different ways, and we’ve put out the open-source
    tooling for that.”

    third-party servers will be able to turn Bluesky’s moderation off altogether.

- en: Bluesky says creating a moderation tool is similar to the way users can create
    block lists. The main difference is that the moderation service won’t be tied
    to an individual account. It will instead let more than one person manage the
    service, review a reporting queue, and set custom labels. Developers can even
    create automated labeling services if they want.

    the industry,” Graber tells *Decoder*. “And as far as I know, nobody’s done exactly
    what we were doing before, which is have this piece of moderation be something
    that any third party, any user, or anyone who wants to come in — even if they’re
    non-technical — can start building on.”
