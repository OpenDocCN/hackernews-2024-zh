    about particles released into the air when a vehicle driver brakes, though evidence
    suggests those particles may be more harmful to health than particles exiting
    the tailpipe.'

- en: In a new study in *[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2313897121)*,
    University of California, Irvine researchers show how most of these particles
    emitted during light braking carry an electric charge – something that could potentially
    be exploited to help reduce air pollution from vehicles.

    charged, and that many of them are in fact highly charged,” saidAdam Thomas, a
    doctoral candidate in the lab of Jim Smith, professor of chemistry, who led the
    study alongside UCI postdoctoral researcher Paulus Bauer.

    caliper. They then measured the electric charge of the aerosols emitted into the
    air and discovered the 80 percent figure.

    really been studied given how common cars are in human societies.”

    health impacts of non-tailpipe emissions in areas beset by car traffic, including
    many areas in Southern California.

    said Manabu Shiraiwa, professor of aerosol chemistry at UCI and one of the researchers
    behind the university-wide project. “Recent results from my lab indicate that
    they may induce oxidative stress, but more research is needed.”

- en: The new study reveals a problem that may grow as electric cars become more and
    more common over the next several decades. Electric cars, Smith explained, are
    not truly zero-emission vehicles, so municipalities need to think about strategies
    to reduce emissions from brake use as well as tailpipes.

- en: The team found that the percentage of charged particles emitted largely depended
    on the material makeup of brake pads. Because the particles carry an electric
    charge, this should make it relatively easy to remove from the air.

    a chance to have an impact at all on health,” said Smith. “All you would need
    to do is to collect them with an electrostatic precipitator – a device that exposes
    the charged particles to an electric field and efficiently sweeps them away.”

    – lower-income parts of cities tend to be more traffic-heavy than others, which
    creates an environmental justice issue wherein certain socioeconomic classes are
    more exposed to brake emissions than others.

- en: According to Professor Barbara Finlayson-Pitts, Distinguished Emeritus Professor
    of chemistry and the principal investigator of the project at UCI, emissions from
    braking are not well-characterized but are potentially significant in high-traffic
    areas. “These areas are often in poorer communities and highlight an important
    aspect of environmental justice that has been largely overlooked,” Finlayson-Pitts
    said.

    Park Neighborhood Association in Santa Ana, which is helping disseminate UCI’s
    scientific findings to the public. Funding for the study came from fees paid by
    Volkswagen as part of a 2016 settlement reached with the California Department
    of Justice, which found that the company used devices that contributed to increased
    air pollution.
