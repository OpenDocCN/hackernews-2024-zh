    I discussed my journey out of being what I called a "Culture Incel" - someone
    who thinks history is driven entirely by material causes and ignores the role
    of culture and ideas. In many ways Cultural Inceldom maps quite neatly to what
    is known in philosophy as [historical materialism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historical_materialism).
    For me, clinging to this belief was a way to handle feeling out of place within
    the culture that surrounded me.

    I needed to cope. My go-to was an article by Scott Alexander called [Society is
    Fixed, Biology is mutable.](https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/09/10/society-is-fixed-biology-is-mutable/)
    In it, he argues that we''re better off looking for material or technological
    solutions to societal problems than trying to engineer society itself. The effectiveness
    of simple biological fixes, such as lead removal leading to a reduction in crime,
    challenges the notion that social engineering is the only path to improvement;
    indeed he argues that Biology is actually much easier to change than Society.
    His post was written 6 years ago, but it was somewhat prescient: one of the problems
    he identified as being improperly tackled through social interventions was obesity.
    In his essay he gives a long list of policy measures that simply have not worked:
    “labeling foods, banning soda machines from school, banning large sodas from New
    York, programs in schools to promote healthy eating, doctors chewing people out
    when they gain weight, the profusion of gyms and Weight Watchers programs”. He
    floated ideas about changing gut bacteria or cutting out trans-fats as potentially
    more effective fixes. Jump to 2024, and while he didn''t nail the specifics, his
    general idea that it might be easier to tackle obesity via biological interventions
    seems correct, thanks to drugs like Ozempic making a [splash in fighting obesity](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9486455/).

    this piece was such good Cope is that it was not even wrong. He was correct about
    the impotency of policy measures in the face of the mighty forces of Biology.
    But he was only half right: that is, because he equates “socio-cultural factors”
    with top-down attempts at social engineering: or, broadly speaking, Policy. And
    by doing that he was missing the importance of Culture. It speaks to the poverty
    of my understanding of the world back then that I took that to support my Culture

    what we call absolutist monarchs were in many ways much less powerful than the

    large scale social engineering tactics specifically looking to change long existing

    the assumed correlation between fertility at younger ages and total realised fertility.
    Maybe we will see a large cultural shift before these women reach the end of their
    reproductive span. Or maybe we will dramatically alter reproductive span, allowing
    women to have children later on in life — the solution I hope for.'

    extrapolation — but there are quite strong indicators that childlessness is being
    culturally re-enforced at the moment and that a windfall increase in late-in-life
    fertility among gen Zs and younger Millennials is not really in the cards. As
    a young woman myself, I do think I am living in a culture that deprioritises having
    children and, at worst, even regards them with suspicion. To begin, there's a
    noticeable anti-natalist current weaving through our cultural narrative. A cursory
    look at popular media headlines—such as [those questioning](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/11/27/the-quickening-elizabeth-rush-book-review-the-parenthood-dilemma-gina-rushton)
    the morality of childbearing in a world grappling with environmental catastrophe—reveals
    this trend. My time in academia has shown me this isn't just media sensationalism;
    among the well-educated, there's a consensus that fewer children equates to environmental
    responsibility, and pro-natalist views are met with skepticism and sometimes even
    outrage.

    everything: one could argue that they are merely a form of virtue signalling and
    they do not influence actual behaviour much. But there are other, more subtle
    indicators that people increasingly do not see kids as a fundamental milestone
    in life. Indeed, as a gen Z woman, I have rarely if ever encountered discussions
    of children when considering career planning. In one way, I am grateful: I know
    many coming from traditional societies who have experienced the opposite: an intense
    pressure to marry, even when such a move would not be ideal for the person in
    question. But the absolute lack of consideration of children seems equally wrong.
    What it tells me is that our culture sees children as an afterthought, something
    to to be considered after career satisfaction has been reached.'

    life. This is compared to 71% who say the same about a career they enjoy and 61%
    who regard having close friends as important. The same survey also reveals an
    increase in the importance placed on having large amounts of money in younger
    cohorts compared to older ones: while only 13% of 65+ adults believe that having
    a lot of money is very important for a fulfilling life, as many as 35% of 18-29
    year olds do! In another [survey](https://www.businessinsider.com/vibe-check-gen-z-survey-data-2023-12?r=US&IR=T)

    by older generations. A [recent study](https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2023/01/24/parenting-in-america-today/)
    highlights that many parents place less importance on their children's marital
    or parental status than on academic and intellectual achievement. This prioritisation
    of career over family stands in stark contrast with the experience of actual parents,
    who find time spent with their children deeply meaningful, often much more so
    that paid work!

    the youth—believe will fulfil them (money, career, status) and what they ultimately
    find most rewarding (spending time with family). How can this seemingly paradoxical
    situation exist? The explanation lies in considering, once again, Culture and
    Biology. A culture that exalts career success will naturally lead young adults
    to prioritise it. Parents, wanting stability and status for their children, nudge
    them towards societal ideals. Yet biology asserts itself when children arrive,
    triggering a profound instinct to nurture, hence why parents end up finding children
    more rewarding. Putting these two pieces together, we get at the final picture:
    children become a ''guilty pleasure,'' indulged in once one has ''earned'' it
    through career and financial success.'

    many millennials, children are not a foundational aspect of life but a culmination,
    an accessory to a life already fulfilled. The notion of foregoing childbearing
    as a sacrifice has reversed; now, the sacrifice lies in forfeiting independence
    for family. Once you see this, you cannot un-see it. Society instils a deep-seated
    anxiety about parenthood—the fear of missing some critical preparatory step is
    pervasive. Having children is no longer portrayed as the default, a hard but ultimately
    manageable task for most people, but rather as a sort of test, that one can easily
    fail if not sufficiently prepared for. Tess-Mathilde Bryan, a 22-year-old florist
    and freelance writer interviewed by Business Insider [perfectly encapsulates this
    attitude](https://www.businessinsider.com/gen-z-does-not-want-kids-will-get-married-2023-12?r=US&IR=T)

    Anyone examining this issue must acknowledge this straightforward truth, alongside
    the reality that our present culture is steering us away from the desired path.
    Lower fertility rates mean [less dynamism](https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/europpblog/2023/11/09/ageing-advanced-capitalist-democracies-risk-heading-for-a-future-of-economic-stagnation/),

    Perhaps more crucially, a culture that deprioritises children might misleadingly
    encourage young adults to voluntarily deprive themselves of something that has
    been consistently shown to be an important source of meaning in humans’ lives.
    In the meantime, economists, policy makers and government advisors are arguing
    how we should rethink policies, calling for [radical reforms](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4255510/).
    However, by overlooking Culture, they risk being entirely misguided, as appears
    to have been the case for the past several decades. It might be that the fate
    of birth rates will be determined more by those who shape people’s attitudes,
    online influencers and the like, than by Government Committees.
