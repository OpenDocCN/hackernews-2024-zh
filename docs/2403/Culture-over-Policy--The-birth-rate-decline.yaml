    I discussed my journey out of being what I called a "Culture Incel" - someone
    who thinks history is driven entirely by material causes and ignores the role
    of culture and ideas. In many ways Cultural Inceldom maps quite neatly to what
    is known in philosophy as [historical materialism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historical_materialism).
    For me, clinging to this belief was a way to handle feeling out of place within

    I needed to cope. My go-to was an article by Scott Alexander called [Society is
    Fixed, Biology is mutable.](https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/09/10/society-is-fixed-biology-is-mutable/)
    In it, he argues that we''re better off looking for material or technological
    solutions to societal problems than trying to engineer society itself. The effectiveness
    of simple biological fixes, such as lead removal leading to a reduction in crime,
    challenges the notion that social engineering is the only path to improvement;
    indeed he argues that Biology is actually much easier to change than Society.
    His post was written 6 years ago, but it was somewhat prescient: one of the problems
    he identified as being improperly tackled through social interventions was obesity.
    In his essay he gives a long list of policy measures that simply have not worked:
    “labeling foods, banning soda machines from school, banning large sodas from New
    York, programs in schools to promote healthy eating, doctors chewing people out
    when they gain weight, the profusion of gyms and Weight Watchers programs”. He
    floated ideas about changing gut bacteria or cutting out trans-fats as potentially
    more effective fixes. Jump to 2024, and while he didn''t nail the specifics, his
    general idea that it might be easier to tackle obesity via biological interventions
    seems correct, thanks to drugs like Ozempic making a [splash in fighting obesity](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9486455/).

    suggesting that attempts at social engineering were doomed to fail. The reason
    this piece was such good Cope is that it was not even wrong. He was correct about
    the impotency of policy measures in the face of the mighty forces of Biology.
    But he was only half right: that is, because he equates “socio-cultural factors”
    with top-down attempts at social engineering: or, broadly speaking, Policy. And
    by doing that he was missing the importance of Culture. It speaks to the poverty
    of my understanding of the world back then that I took that to support my Culture
    Incel views. I do not think this is an uncommon failure mode: indeed, among “rational”,
    shape rotator and utilitarian minded people, the kind of people who read SSC,
    the kind of reasonable writers and policy wonks that avoid the messy world of
    cultural insanity, this is quite a common view. A good, recent example of this

    Kearney''s analysis appears to overlook the impact of culture entirely, attributing
    the phenomenon solely to economic changes and proposing policy solutions. Avoiding
    culture completely does not just make the book factually wrong: it also leads

    1791 in those regions, as a proxy for the degree of secularisation in each region.
    The effect sizes are quite large: secularised regions in France experienced a
    significant decline in fertility rates more than a hundred years earlier than
    their religious counterparts. The estimated marginal impact of the presence of
    refractory clergy in 1791 on fertility is approximately one. Remarkably, this
    effect size mirrors the decrease in fertility observed during the latter half
    of the eighteenth century, where the average number of children born to a woman
    dropped from 4.5 to 3.5 over a span of around forty years. Another interesting
    finding is that secularisation seems to have mostly affected fertility at its
    intensive margin: large families were the most impacted. To isolate the impact
    of secularisation from other location-specific institutional factors influencing
    fertility trends, the study employs several empirical methods. The one that I

    the moment, but still strongly desire to have a good career, due to the sense
    of security it offers. I also expect that the percentage of people who see their

- en: 'Nevertheless, there seems to be a dissonance between what people—particularly
    the youth—believe will fulfil them (money, career, status) and what they ultimately
    find most rewarding (spending time with family). How can this seemingly paradoxical
    situation exist? The explanation lies in considering, once again, Culture and
    Biology. A culture that exalts career success will naturally lead young adults
    to prioritise it. Parents, wanting stability and status for their children, nudge
    them towards societal ideals. Yet biology asserts itself when children arrive,
    triggering a profound instinct to nurture, hence why parents end up finding children
    more rewarding. Putting these two pieces together, we get at the final picture:
    children become a ''guilty pleasure,'' indulged in once one has ''earned'' it
    through career and financial success.'

  zh: 然而，人们，尤其是年轻人，认为能够让他们满足的东西（金钱、事业、地位）和最终发现最有价值的东西（与家人共度时光）之间似乎存在着不和谐。为什么这种看似矛盾的情况会存在呢？解释在于再次考虑文化和生物。一个崇尚事业成功的文化自然会促使年轻人优先考虑事业。父母希望他们的孩子拥有稳定和地位，推动他们朝着社会意识形态的理想前进。但是当孩子来临时，生物学表现出来，触发了对孩子的深刻养育本能，这解释了为什么父母最终发现养育孩子更有价值。将这两个方面结合起来，我们得出最终结论：孩子成为一种“内疚的快乐”，一旦一个人通过事业和财务成功“赢得”了它。

- en: 'Anna Rotkirch''s research further underlines this shift: she argues that for
    many millennials, children are not a foundational aspect of life but a culmination,
    an accessory to a life already fulfilled. The notion of foregoing childbearing
    as a sacrifice has reversed; now, the sacrifice lies in forfeiting independence
    for family. Once you see this, you cannot un-see it. Society instils a deep-seated
    anxiety about parenthood—the fear of missing some critical preparatory step is
    pervasive. Having children is no longer portrayed as the default, a hard but ultimately
    manageable task for most people, but rather as a sort of test, that one can easily
    fail if not sufficiently prepared for. Tess-Mathilde Bryan, a 22-year-old florist
    and freelance writer interviewed by Business Insider [perfectly encapsulates this
    attitude](https://www.businessinsider.com/gen-z-does-not-want-kids-will-get-married-2023-12?r=US&IR=T)

  zh: 安娜·罗特基奇的研究进一步强调了这种转变：她认为对于许多千禧一代来说，孩子不是生活的基础，而是一种高潮，是对已经实现的生活的一个附属物。放弃生育的想法已经颠倒；现在，放弃独立来成家立业是一种牺牲。一旦你看到这一点，你就无法忘记。社会灌输了关于育儿的深刻焦虑——对错过一些重要的准备步骤的恐惧是普遍存在的。生孩子不再被描绘为默认行为，对大多数人来说是一个艰难但最终可以应对的任务，而是一种考验，如果没有充分的准备，很容易失败。22岁的花匠兼自由撰稿人泰丝-玛蒂尔德·布莱恩在接受《商业内幕》采访时[完美地概括了这种态度](https://www.businessinsider.com/gen-z-does-not-want-kids-will-get-married-2023-12?r=US&IR=T)：
- en: I would just want to make sure that I'm so financially stable and have the perfect
    place to live, a comfortable place where I think kids would like to be. I feel
    like people kind of used to just have kids to do it. It used to just be a normal
    step in people's lives, but I think people hopefully now are taking more things
    into consideration and trying not to put that expectation on themselves.

    Perhaps more crucially, a culture that deprioritises children might misleadingly
    encourage young adults to voluntarily deprive themselves of something that has
    been consistently shown to be an important source of meaning in humans’ lives.
    In the meantime, economists, policy makers and government advisors are arguing
    how we should rethink policies, calling for [radical reforms](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4255510/).
    However, by overlooking Culture, they risk being entirely misguided, as appears
    to have been the case for the past several decades. It might be that the fate
    of birth rates will be determined more by those who shape people’s attitudes,
    online influencers and the like, than by Government Committees.
