    once: I was on South Padre Island on April 20, 2023, when SpaceX launched its
    Starship for the very first time from Boca Chica Beach. It will be essential that
    they hear it from me, though, because this is how it was reported by the press
    at the time:'

    tremendous roar of 33 rocket engines, the cheers on the beach—which made reading
    such headlines all the more jarring.

    SpaceX lingo it experienced a RUD, or “[Rapid Unscheduled Disassembly](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/20/science/rapid-unscheduled-disassembly-starship-rocket.html).”
    The RUD occurred about four minutes into the test, before the Starship spacecraft
    had a chance to separate from its massive “Super Heavy” rocket booster.

    incidentally lost their blue checks on Twitter that day and had to pay $8 to get
    them back. It was true that politicians in the area complained about how loud
    the rocket was, and that the fire from dozens of massive rocket engines made a
    mess on the beach.

    point. While journalists were rushing to figure out their angle of attack—many
    opted to focus on their personal dislike for Musk—the SpaceX team was rushing
    to figure out what had worked, and what went wrong. It was [later determined](https://arstechnica.com/space/2023/09/faa-says-spacex-has-more-to-do-before-starship-can-fly-again/)
    that a series of smaller explosions had destroyed several engines, initiating
    the rocket’s self-destruct system. That system malfunctioned for forty seconds
    while the rocket did somersaults high in the sky, until eventually completing
    the self-destruct.

    to success. For SpaceX in particular, it was the company’s keystone strategy for
    the past twenty years: learn from iterating quickly on failures until you can
    repeat success.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That strategy worked magnificently. Recall that in 2008, SpaceX was a fledgling
    company; its first three launch attempts, from 2006 to 2008, of its first rocket,
    Falcon 1, were all [failures](https://archive.ph/20130104191629/http://www.spacelaunchreport.com/falcon.html).
    No private company had *ever* successfully launched a rocket before. But the lessons
    from those three failures enabled the SpaceX team to successfully launch the Falcon
    1 on the fourth try. Sixteen years later, SpaceX Falcons are the most launched
    American rockets in history, with hundreds of consecutive successes. The Falcon
    9 Full Thrust has been [launched 309 times](https://www.spacex.com/vehicles/falcon-9/)—with
    no failures. Zero.

    [made it to space](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/03/14/science/starship-spacex-launch)
    at orbital speed. Stage separation has been successful twice now. SpaceX tested
    opening the Starship’s cargo doors and has laid the groundwork for in-orbit fuel
    transfers, which are important for deep space missions. The Super Heavy booster
    reentered the atmosphere before an RUD 1500 feet over the Gulf of Mexico. The
    Starship connected to SpaceX’s own satellite internet network while it was hurtling
    violently around the Earth so that it could livestream its flight through a plasma
    field to millions of viewers. Please read the previous sentence again.

    them much cheaper and more reliable thanks to reusable rockets. The company launches
    the outright majority of worldwide material to orbit—that’s mostly [commercial
    satellites and cargo](https://www.spacex.com/humanspaceflight/iss/) for the International
    Space Station, though Elon Musk did once launch his personal Tesla Roadster sports

    Outside of Russia and China, SpaceX accounted for over 99.9 percent of material
    sent to orbit at the end of 2023\. The Falcon Heavy has achieved a cargo-cost-per-kilogram
    of [just $1,500](https://www.theguardian.com/science/2023/sep/17/tim-peake-backs-idea-for-solar-farms-in-space-as-costs-fall),

    think what happened as computers became 99 percent cheaper over time: what used
    to fill up a room and cost a fortune now fits in our pocket and is accessible
    to billions of people. When it becomes dramatically cheaper to get heavy things
    into space, a new paradigm opens up: we can build orbital factories to take advantage
    of microgravity for manufacturing, or move a lot of mass to the moon or to Mars—enough
    to start a colony some day. The cost of cargo on Starship could be so low that
    the Air Force has [contracted SpaceX](https://www.cnet.com/tech/tech-industry/spacex-signs-a-deal-to-rocket-military-cargo-around-the-world/)

    from its Starlink internet. Starlink is now the world’s largest satellite constellation

    the Arctic. That makes Starlink indispensable for the military, airplanes, and
    people in remote locations.
