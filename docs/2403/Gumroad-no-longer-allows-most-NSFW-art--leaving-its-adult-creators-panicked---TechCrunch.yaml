- en: Gumroad, an e-commerce company for creators, updated its [rules](https://help.gumroad.com/article/156-gumroad-and-adult-content)
    to more strictly limit NSFW content, citing restrictions from payment processors
    like Stripe and PayPal.

    these sudden policy changes can be detrimental, resulting in an unforeseen loss
    of income.

    of all types of creators in my sphere: artists, writers, sex workers and content
    creators of all kinds,” Sleepingirl, a kink educator and writer, told TechCrunch.
    “This is obviously far from the first site that is bending to the pressure of
    payment processors, and it will not be the last, but this is the first time my
    content (which is primarily academic and educational) seems to be threatened.”'

    on [Patreon](https://www.vice.com/en/article/vbqwwj/patreon-suspension-of-adult-content-creators),
    which used to be much more lax about NSFW content, and it almost happened on [OnlyFans](https://techcrunch.com/2022/10/19/onlyfans-ceo-says-adult-content-will-still-have-a-home-on-the-site-in-5-years/).
    But that doesn’t make the impact of these policy changes any less debilitating.
    When creators have to port over their followers to a new platform, or direct fans
    to a different web shop to buy their products, the friction can result in a loss
    of income.

    Gumroad founder Sahil Lavingia told TechCrunch. He declined to say which company
    asked Gumroad to enforce stricter rules. “Obviously, it sucks to do this. We don’t
    take it lightly that many creators rely on Gumroad for their livelihoods and have
    communicated that to our partners wherever and whenever we could,” he said. “We’ve
    been around since 2011, and this isn’t a new fight. It’s ongoing.”

- en: It’s becoming increasingly difficult to monetize sexual works online. In 2021,
    OnlyFans announced it would no longer host adult content, which was baffling,
    since the site is almost synonymous with sex (OnlyFans has tried to push its [safe-for-work
    offerings](https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/17/onlyfans-promotes-its-sfw-app-as-it-seeks-funding-at-a-1b-valuation/),
    with little success). The site saw so much pushback that it reversed course; now,
    OnlyFans is able to accept credit card payments from Visa/Mastercard since it
    complies with the payment processor’s recent, more rigorous adult content policies.
    People who appear in porn on OnlyFans must verify their identity through both
    legal documents and biometric scans, and they must sign a form confirming that
    all models consented to be recorded.

    performing in porn and aren’t representing real people in their work at all.

    “I am trying to plan next steps, but Gumroad was an ideal, free storefront for
    e-books and instructional videos like I sell, and all other sorts of digital content.
    Almost all other services charge a hefty monthly fee and have terms of service
    that already disallow adult content.”
