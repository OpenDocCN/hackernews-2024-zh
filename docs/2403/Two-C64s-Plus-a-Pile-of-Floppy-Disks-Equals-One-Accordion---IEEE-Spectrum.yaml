    others have a grid of black and white buttons set roughly in the shape of a parallelogram.
    I’ve been fascinated by this [“chromatic-button](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromatic_button_accordion)”
    layout for a long time. I realized that the buttons are staggered just like the
    keys on a typewriter, and this insight somehow turned into a blurry vision of
    an accordion built from a pair of 1980s home computers—these machines typically
    sported a built-in keyboard in a case big enough to form the two ends of an accordion.
    The idea was intriguing—but would it really work?'

    so it was an obvious choice for me to use that machine for the accordion ends.
    As a retrocomputing enthusiast, I wanted to use vintage C64s with minimal modifications
    rather than, say, gutting the computer cases and putting modern equipment inside.

    sheets, typically rectangular with an opening in the middle. The sheets are attached
    to each other alternating between the inner and outer edges. Another flash of
    insight: The bellows could be made from a stack of 5.25-inch floppy disks.'

    large quantity of bad floppies from a fellow C64 enthusiast. And then, armed with
    everything I needed and eager to start, I was promptly distracted by other projects.

    The idea to model a musical keyboard layout after the chromatic-button accordion
    became a standalone C64 program released to the public called [Qwertuoso](https://linusakesson.net/software/qwertuoso/index.php).

    for detecting air flow through the bellows, and buttons for turning on the power
    and controlling a tape-deck emulator [top right]. The bellows are made from tape
    and 5.25-inch floppy disks [middle right]. One supporting board incorporates a
    microcontroller to measure the airflow and mix the audio signals, a second stores
    the accordion software and emulates a cassette player, and a third acts as a power
    hub.James Provost

- en: That could well have been the end of it, but I had all these disks on my hands,
    so I decided to go ahead and try to craft a bellows after all. The body of a floppy
    disk is made from a folded sheet of plastic, which I unfolded to form the bellow’s
    segments. But I had underestimated the problem of air leakage. While the floppy-disk
    material is airtight, the seams aren’t. In the end I had to patch the whole thing
    up with multiple layers of tape to get the air to stay inside.

    How fast the bellows is pumped determines the accordion’s loudness. So I needed
    a way to sense how fast air was being squeezed out of my floppy-disk bellows as
    I played.

    including one inspired by the [“hot wire” sensors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_flow_sensor#Hot_wire_sensor_(MAF))
    used in fuel injection systems. Then one day, I was watching a video and I realized
    that a person in the video was shouting in order to overcome noise caused by wind
    hitting his microphone. That was the breakthrough I needed! The solution turned
    out to be a small microphone, mounted at an angle just outside a small hole in
    the bellows.

    turbulence turns into audio noise. The intensity of the noise is measured, in
    my case by an [ATmega8](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/product/ATMEGA8) microcontroller,
    and is used to determine the output volume of the instrument.

    also holds the C64s as well as three boards with supporting electronics. One of
    these is a power hub that takes in 5 and 12 volts of DC electricity from two household-power
    adapters and distributes it to the various components. For ergonomic reasons,
    rather than using the normal socket on the C64s right-hand sides, I fed power
    into the C64s by wires passed through the case and directly soldered to the motherboards.

- en: The Commodordion is played by using the keys on the Commodore 64s and squeezing
    the bellows between. Air moving through the bellows creates a loud or soft noise
    depending on how hard the bellows are squeezed. A microcontroller running an envelope-following
    program controls a multiplexing digital-to-audio converter that sets the final
    volume of the combined sound from the C64s.James Provost

- en: A second board emulates Commodore’s datasette tape recorder. This stores the
    Qwertuoso program. Once the C64s are turned on, a keyboard shortcut built into
    the original OS directs the computer to load from tape. The final board contains
    the microcontroller monitoring the bellows’ microphone and mixers that combine
    the analog sound generated by each C64s [6581 SID audio chip](https://spectrum.ieee.org/chip-hall-of-fame-mos-technology-6581)
    and adjusts the volume as per the bellows air sensor. The audio signal is then
    passed to an external amplified loudspeaker to produce sound.

    my hand needs to bend quite far around the edge of what I dubbed [the Commodordion](https://linusakesson.net/commodordion/index.php).
    This puts a lot of strain on the hand, wrist, and arm. Partly for this reason,
    I developed a sequencer for the left-hand-side machine, whereby I can program
    a simple beat or pattern and have it repeat automatically. With this, I only have
    to press keys on the left-hand side occasionally, to switch chords.

    piece of music, you practice the same motions over and over for hours. If those
    motions cause strain you can easily ruin your body. So, unfortunately, I have
    to restrict myself to playing the Commodordion only occasionally, and only play
    very simple parts with the left hand.

    encouraging: I’ll use that as a starting point as I continue to explore the design
    space of instruments made from old computers. In that light, the Commodordion
    wasn’t the final goal after all, but an important piece of scaffolding for my
    next creative endeavor.'
