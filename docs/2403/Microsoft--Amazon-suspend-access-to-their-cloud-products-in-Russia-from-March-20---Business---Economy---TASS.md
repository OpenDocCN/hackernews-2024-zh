MOSCOW, March 15\. /TASS/. Microsoft and Amazon will suspend access to their cloud products in Russia from March 20, the Russian company Softline announced.

Softline notes that it has received this information from Microsoft and Amazon. "For Russian companies, this means that it will be impossible to use these products or access the data contained in them from March 20, 2024," the company said.

Elena Volotovskaya, Vice President for Investments at Softline, also published a letter from Microsoft on her Telegram channel. As the Russian company warned, due to the closure of access, functional restrictions in the operation of cloud products and services from Microsoft, Amazon, and Google are possible.

The restrictions are prompted by the 12th package of EU sanctions against Russia dated December 19, 2023\. In particular, the package limited supplies of software for business analytics and other products to the country.

"It is important to note that it can concern all cloud products from Microsoft, Amazon and Google, which copyright holders determine as prohibited for delivery to Russia in accordance with the requirements of the regulation [EU 833/2014]," Softline concludes.
