    the Mighty 8th Air Force kept their units in line.

- en: Somewhere over Southern England, the crew of a fully bombed-up, four-engined
    Consolidated B-24J Liberator by the name of *You Can’t Take it With You* beats
    its way through low clouds on a hot hazy day. They are bound for the railroad
    marshalling yards outside Munich. The day is steamy; the visibility is low and
    grey. The wings flex. The pilots repeatedly lift from their seats, to the limits
    of their seat belts. The noise in the cockpit is thunderous, the heat is almost
    liquid. It smells of gas and sweat and Bakelite. Fear rises from their guts, dries
    their mouths, and increases their heart rates. It’s midsummer of 1944; 20 July
    to be exact.

- en: The pilots lean forward, toward the windscreen, craning in the haze, looking
    for aircraft of their unit, looking to coalesce into a solid box formation which
    will enable them to cover each other in the coming battle. Soon, they will be
    raked by German fighters en route. Many will fall. Many will die. There will be
    a trail of smoking pyres the length of their route to Germany.

- en: To the left and right now, rising up from behind, they see other Liberators
    working their way up to join them. Many are worn and tired looking, though most
    rolled out of the factories in Texas and California just the previous year. Paint
    is stained with oil and exhaust soot, flaking from every edge that is exposed
    to the slipstream. On their sides, they carry outrageous and sometimes puerile
    artwork and names like *Arise My Love and Come With Me*, *Squat ’n Drop it*, *S.O.L*.,
    *Time’s a Wastin’* and *Big Chief Little Beaver*. They are drawn up closer, closer,
    like moths to a flame. Below them, between the layers of heavy cloud, they glimpse
    the green farmlands of the English countryside and many more Liberators, sliding
    across their track, moving together toward their destiny.

- en: In front now, they see the one Liberator they have been looking for. Actually
    they can’t miss her. She slides and bucks on invisible currents, lit by the late
    afternoon sun which flashes on her white wings. She climbs, beckoning to them
    to join her. She fires flares from her flanks, flashes lights on her side—everything
    to make herself visible to the other aircraft of her Group—the 458th. She maintains
    a steady climb, a steady rate of knots, and a steady predictable course. She is
    a beacon to all her mates, calling out for them to join her. Once *You Can’t Take
    it With You* and the others are with her, she turns toward the English Channel,
    dragging her Group behind her like an deathly cappa magna.

- en: As the pilot brings *You Can’t Take it With You* close to the lead ship, he
    and his co-pilot smile and even make a few tasteless jokes. The aircraft they
    are following, the one they have been looking for, is not like the others in the
    group. She wears a paint scheme any other Liberator would think humiliating—white
    from chin turret to trailing edge, covered in a pox of bright red and blue polka
    dots about 18 inches in diameter. Aft of the trailing wing edge, she is army green,
    but the pox extends down her flanks in garish red and yellow dots. And she has
    a face... perhaps it was meant to be that of a shark, but it grins like a dim-witted
    dachshund. It seems to pant in the heat of the turbulent air. The spotted markings
    make her look like a massive flying bag of Wonderbread. The only marking she shares
    with the other aircraft of the group is the red paint and white diagonal slash
    of her barn door-sized tails.

  zh: 当飞行员将《无法随你而去》（*You Can’t Take it With You*）靠近领航舰时，他和他的副驾驶员微笑着，甚至开了几个不合时宜的笑话。他们追随的飞机与舰队中的其他飞机不同。她的涂装让任何一架解放者（Liberator）都会觉得羞辱——从下巴炮塔到后缘，全是白色，布满直径约18英寸的明亮红色和蓝色斑点。在后缘翼尖以后，她是军绿色的，但是这些斑点延伸到她的侧面，是醒目的红色和黄色斑点。而且她有一个面孔……也许本来是鲨鱼的，但它笑得像一只愚蠢的达克斯猎犬。它似乎在湍流气流中喘息。斑点的标记让她看起来像一个巨大的飞行的白面包袋。她与舰队其他飞机唯一共享的标记是她巨大尾部的红色涂料和白色斜线。
- en: She is also in terrible shape. Dirt streams over her wings from the exhaust
    stacks. Her sides are dented and scraped. She does not carry her old name on her
    sides anymore. Her guns have been removed; she carries a light load of fuel for
    she is not going on to the target with her charges. Once, she was *Dixie Bell
    II*, a combat veteran. But she was deemed “troublesome”, perhaps beset by gremlins.
    The pilots who are following her now call her *Spotted Ass Ape*, *Spotted Ape*
    or even *Wonderbread*.

  zh: 她也处于糟糕的状态。污垢从排气口流过她的翼。她的侧面凹陷和划伤。她的侧面不再挂着她的旧名字。她的机枪已经被移除；她携带轻负荷的燃料，因为她不会带着她的负荷去目标地点。曾经，她是“迪克西贝尔二号”（*Dixie
    Bell II*），一位战斗老兵。但她被认为“麻烦重重”，或许是被小妖鬼所困扰。现在跟随她的飞行员们称她为“斑点屁股猿”（*Spotted Ass Ape*）、“斑点猿”或甚至是“奇迹面包”（*Wonderbread*）。
