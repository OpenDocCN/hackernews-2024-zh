# Open-Source Observability | SigNoz

> 来源：[https://signoz.io/](https://signoz.io/)

Just deployed SigNoz to an EKS cluster.Still can't believe this is free, everything works like a charm. I am really really impressed with the documentation and dashboard.

Still in awe. Sneak peek into running the product, you can easily set retention period for metrics, traces and logs with one click and set cold storage for old logs to s3 with few config changes.
