- en: Sandboxing Python can be very useful for developers but has been challenging
    due to the flexibility of CPython implementation. It is particularly useful in
    many scenarios to have sandboxed Python.  For example, on any website that needs
    to execute arbitrary code from users, like coding practice sites or online interpreters.
    It could also be useful to help prevent increasing attacks on LLMs (Large Language
    Models).

- en: Win32 App Isolation is designed to isolate Win32 application by creating a security
    boundary between the application and the OS, using the combination of AppContainer,
    virtualized resources and brokering file system, which helps to prevent the application
    from compromising the operating system.

    with Win32 App Isolation on recent Windows Insider releases. It takes about 30-60
    minutes and anyone with the insider version of Windows can do it on their local

    the system from being compromised while keeping all the functionalities from Python.
