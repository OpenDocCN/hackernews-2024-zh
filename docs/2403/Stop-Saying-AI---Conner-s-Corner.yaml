    refer to LLMs as AI. I guess this is my tiny rebellion against the ongoing hype.

    lot less frustrating. You can probably tell I use DALL-E to generate some of the
    hero images on this site. I use one to help me proofread and edit things quite
    often. They are going to have negative impacts on the number of jobs in some industries.
    But they are not intelligence and anyone who spends time with them quickly realizes
    they are just a very superpowered suggestion engine. AI gives the idea of them
    way more power than they deserve, so let’s stop calling them that.
