- en: In March 1983, President Reagan unveiled a new vision of national security based
    on protecting lives rather than threatening them. This announcement kicked off
    the Strategic Defense Initiative—popularly known as Star Wars—that invigorated
    weapons work at Livermore. The Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI) included so-called
    third-generation, or nuclear directed-energy, weapons. Design teams began studies
    of the nuclear-powered x-ray laser as a candidate defense technology and explored
    the physics of such weapons in underground nuclear tests. The main focus of SDI,
    however, was on developing an effective nonnuclear defense, and two prominent
    efforts at Livermore were work on free-electron lasers and Brilliant Pebbles.

- en: O Group, which was led by Lowell Wood and included many extremely talented young
    scientists, originated the Brilliant Pebbles concept, and the Strategic Defense
    Initiative Organization (SDIO) began funding Livermore for Brilliant Pebbles R&D
    in 1987\. Brilliant Pebbles were to be small, lightweight spacecraft that could
    stop advanced ballistic missiles and their components in boost phase by colliding
    with them at high speeds. On command, a global constellation of these nonnuclear
    spacecraft could detect and destroy missiles without any external help. Because
    of the system’s attractive low-cost and survivability attributes, Brilliant Pebbles
    became a baseline system in SDIO’s Strategic Defense System Phase I Architecture
    in 1990\. With the winding down of the Cold War, this architecture was scaled-back
    to become Global Protection Against Limited Strikes (GPALS) and still included
    Brilliant Pebbles.

    work on Brilliant Pebbles was discontinued. However, before program cancellation,
    SDIO carried out the Clementine Deep Space Experiment, spectacularly demonstrating
    Brilliant Pebbles technologies. [See 1994 about Clementine mapping the Moon.]
