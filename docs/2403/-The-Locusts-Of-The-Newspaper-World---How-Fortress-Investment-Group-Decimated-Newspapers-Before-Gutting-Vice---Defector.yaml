    stories, and journalists from communities that are not only white and upper middle
    class telling those stories, and that's a really positive development of the last
    20 years. That is something that the digital news environment has provided that
    the chain newspaper market didn't.

    we were media workers working for a media company. So there were just things that

    can we take on that beat, move into that zone, pick up a few more readers?**'

    Investment Group care if there is a functioning *Beaver County Times* in Pennsylvania,
    or even a functioning *Miami Herald* or *El Nuevo Herald*? And if not, what does
    that mean?

    making it rain in Philadelphia. Profit has been a part of the news ecosystem since
    colonial times, there's no question.

    media owners or news owners, and there often was this sense of mission that drove
    news companies. And I don't mean to be so naive as to suggest that Hearst and
    Pulitzer didn't have their clubby, wealthy friends, and they weren't influenced
    by them. Katharine Graham was hated by unionized press people.

    But I think that the point, the mission, is a really important one. So what's
    troubling about today's media ecosystem is that the owners just don't care about
    the closure or the complete decimation of that news organization. And then what's
    happening to those readers or viewers. They're moving in the void.

    turning to [conservative radio](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/miami-spanish-language-radio-misinformation_n_616dbd3ee4b005b245c0b57e),

    channels. Or they're turning to WhatsApp, or other platforms where misinformation
    and disinformation thrives. And that should trouble all of us.

    about this almost every day for a month. What that tells me is the fact that these
    locusts, like Fortress Investment Group, and the kind of absolute democratic hazard
    they pose in the journalism industry, and the threats they pose in *other* industries—like
    health care, like child care, like housing—is starting to get the kind of attention
    [it deserves]. And maybe we can no longer, as citizens, turn away from this. And
    that provides me with some hope.
