    you still had a lot of markets in the United States where print was king. So let's
    say you owned a furniture store in Peoria, Ill. You probably were advertising
    in that local newspaper. There weren't many other avenues for you. And if you

- en: 'So my issue, getting back to your initial question, I want to be very clear:
    I think that there is a monetary reason that private equity got involved in the
    newspaper market in United States. I also think that there is a very clear business
    interest. I think that these firms are actually benefiting from having a press
    that is hamstrung. I believe that. Because why if you are involved in [for-profit
    hospitals](https://arstechnica.com/health/2024/01/hospitals-slash-staff-services-quality-of-care-when-private-equity-takes-over/),
    in [for-profit rail](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/fortress-backed-rail-company-brightline-gets-an-ally-in-california-s-treasurer-1.1698943),

    just saw a news headline yesterday for [for-profit childcare](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/16/us/child-care-centers-private-equity.html),
    God forbid—anything that is for-profit, why would you want a robust newspaper
    system that has the investigative capacity to actually monitor those types of
    industries, or the government officials that you could potentially put in your

    called a [2-and-20](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/two_and_twenty.asp).
    Generally, you take a 2 percent management fee and 20 percent of the profits.
    So that 2 percent fee sometimes is one percent, sometimes it's 1.5 percent, but
    it's called the 2-and-20\. If Fortress didn't take a 2-and-20, it would be like
    a Major League Baseball team not taking spring training. So their extraction from
    Vice would have been substantial, there's no question in my mind. And it would
    have had an effect on the day-to-day operations. There's no question.

  zh: 所以，你知道的，我认为这是希望的标志：我认为已经有一些向着解决方案迈进的动作。还有一件事我要告诉你，Moskie，即使所有这些裁员，我的学生们仍然在来。他们依然对新闻专业感兴趣。
- en: 'They are coming from high schools with regular school-shooting drills, growing
    up worried about climate change, and they''ve seen their parents struggle with
    paying their mortgages or their rent payments during COVID. They''ve seen the
    effects of, I think, a power structure that has failed them, and maybe a political
    system that in some respects has failed them. I think they understand that, without
    a robust journalism industry, it gets worse. And these are the kinds of students
    that are coming, or at least that are coming to American University, where I teach,
    and they want to know: How can we be watchdogs? How can we be investigative journalists?'

  zh: 这些学生来自经常进行校园枪击演练的高中，他们在担心气候变化的同时成长起来，他们看到他们的父母在COVID期间努力支付抵押贷款或租金。他们看到了我认为是一个让他们失望的权力结构，也许还有在某些方面让他们失望的政治体系。我认为他们明白，没有一个强大的新闻行业，情况会变得更糟。这些学生，或者至少是那些来到我所教授的美国大学的学生，他们想知道：我们如何成为守护者？我们如何成为调查记者？

    training journalists, but now trying to create opportunities and to think about
    saving the industry. That''s where my work is going to start to turn. And I wish
    I could say I knew exactly what that looked like. But there are a number of us
    around the country for whom that is where our work is turning. It is trying to
    say: *What''s next? *'

  zh: 所以我的工作已经转向尝试创造更多机会。不仅仅是培训记者，而是现在试图创造机会，并考虑如何挽救这个行业。这就是我的工作即将开始转向的方向。我希望我能说我确切知道那会是什么样子。但在全国范围内，有很多人的工作正在转向这个方向。我们试图去问：*接下来会是什么？*
