    programming aimed at younger viewers, the streaming giant continued to include
    hundreds of tobacco depictions in *The Queen’s Gambit, The Umbrella Academy* and
    other new and popular shows during 2020, according to a [report](https://truthinitiative.org/sites/default/files/media/files/2022/01/While%20You%20Were%20Streaming%20-%20Nicotine%20on%20Demand%20Final%20Report%20Jan%202022.pdf

    2019, didn’t release a new season in 2020, and therefore did not contribute to
    Netflix’s high overall rate of tobacco depictions, 30.1% of viewers age 15-24
    surveyed by Truth Initiative said they had binge-watched past seasons of the show
    during 2020, illustrating the fact that older media can also significantly contribute
    to younger viewers’ exposure to smoking imagery.

    many as 100,000 more children becoming regular smokers every day, according to
    the [*British Medical Journal*](https://thorax.bmj.com/content/65/5/377 "https://thorax.bmj.com/content/65/5/377").
    Young people who are most exposed to smoking imagery in movies are roughly twice
    as likely to begin smoking than young people who are exposed to the least smoking
    imagery, according to a [report](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK99237/
    "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK99237/") by the U.S. Surgeon General. An
    updated R-rating that reduced young viewers’ in-theater exposure from an annual
    mean of 275 tobacco images to 10 or less would reduce adolescent smoking rates
    by 18%, according to the University of California San Francisco’s [Smokefree Media](https://smokefreemedia.ucsf.edu/research/key-reports
    "https://smokefreemedia.ucsf.edu/research/key-reports") project. However, streaming

    of all TV use as of November 2021, exposed about 27 million young people to smoking
    and vaping imagery in 2020, according to the Truth Initiative.
