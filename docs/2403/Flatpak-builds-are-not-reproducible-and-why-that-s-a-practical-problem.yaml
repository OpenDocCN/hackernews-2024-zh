    topic. Flatpaks *technically* **are reproducible!** All the metadata needed to
    reproduce the build is present **inside** the built package.

    You can find them under /usr/manifest.json and /app/manifest.json for runtime
    and application respectively.

    package itself, **that information is not committed to the source tree**, which
    **brings the problems I listed below in the original article**. Flatpaks are reproducible,
    but the tooling around them could be improved to get a better developer experience
    when building from source.

    flatpak is becoming the de-facto standard app distribution format: Just open [flathub.org](https://flathub.org)
    to see how many flatpaks are already out there; It has broad distro support and
    it''s completely open source (even server-side); overall, it''s well appreciated
    by both users and developers. I want flatpaks to succeed, but I think they got
    some fundamental things wrong. Fortunately, these things can be fixed.'

    manager who cares about reproducibility: Nix, cargo, npm... I understand `flatpak-builder`
    isn''t a package manager, but *something* in the flatpak build chain should create
    the lockfile.'

    to a specific version: if the runtime is locked, it can''t be updated without
    programmer intervention, so apps can''t be automatically rebuilt to get security
    updates. This is a problem, indeed, but that can be easily solved by software
    repositories by simply overriding the lockfile. In this way, developers have reproducible
    debug builds (so they can actually track down bugs) and users can receive security
    updates. It''s still better than what we have now.'

- en: Those are (conceptually) simple solutions, but I think they can greatly improve
    the flatpak ecosystem. Nix, and Guix, the state of the art package managers, have
    already solved these issues. Flatpak is trying to be both a package manager and
    an app distribution system. The latter part is good, the former part is just...
    bad.
