    by the Office of Management and Budget, are the latest effort to label and define
    the people of the United States. This evolving process often reflects changes
    in social attitudes and immigration, as well as a wish for people in an increasingly
    diverse society to see themselves in the numbers produced by the federal government.

    Anand, senior director for Census & Data Equity at The Leadership Conference on
    Civil and Human Rights. “It’s how we conceive ourselves as a society. ... You

    so they can tell their own stories.”

    asked separately on forms will be combined into a single question. That will give
    respondents the option to pick multiple categories at the same time, such as “Black,”
    “American Indian” and “Hispanic.” Research has shown that large numbers of Hispanic
    people aren’t sure [how to answer the race question](https://apnews.com/article/hispanic-census-2020-race-identity-b87843790fdd6f1eaf61933a6cc432bc)

    to be similar and they often pick “some other race” or do not answer the question.

    which asked respondents to elaborate on their backgrounds, [suggest that 3.5 million

    now widely regarded as pejorative, as well as the terms “majority” and “minority,”
    because they fail to reflect the nation’s complex racial and ethnic diversity,
    some officials say. The revisions also encourage the collection of detailed race
    and ethnicity data beyond the minimum standards, such as “Haitian” or “Jamaican”
    for someone who checks “Black.”

    category, such as Japanese and Filipino in the Asian classification, often masks
    disparities in income or health, and advocates argued having the detailed data
    will allow the information about the subgroups to be separated out in a process
    called disaggregation.

    of discrimination, the ability to enforce laws around discrimination and do research
    on public health and economic outcomes,” said Allison Plyer, chief demographer

    federal statisticians and bureaucrats who prefer to stay above the political fray.
    But the revisions have long-term implications for legislative redistricting, civil
    rights laws, health statistics, and possibly even politics as the number of people
    categorized as white is reduced.

    consistent data across agencies and come up with figures that could help enforce
    civil rights laws. They were last updated in 1997 when five minimum race categories
    were delineated — American Indian or Alaska Native, Asian, Black or African American,
    Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander and white; respondents could pick more
    than one race. The minimum ethnic categories were grouped separately as not Hispanic
    or Hispanic or Latino.

    not explicitly counted in the census until 1860\. Following years of immigration
    from China, “Chinese” was included in the 1870 census. There was not a formal
