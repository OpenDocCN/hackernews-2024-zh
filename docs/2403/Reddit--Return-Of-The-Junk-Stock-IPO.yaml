    controls and improving its internal control over financial reporting. Investors
    need to know if a company’s financials can be trusted, and in this case, there
    are no assurances given that the reporting procedure are still being built and
    tested.

- en: The expectations baked into Reddit’s reported IPO valuation look highly optimistic.
    Often, the best hope investors might have in overvalued stocks is for an established
    company to acquire the firm. However, investors shouldn’t get their hopes up.
    As noted above the competitors with the most cash already have larger user bases,
    with better monetization, and robust advertising platforms. Additionally, competition
    has had many years to acquire Reddit prior to this IPO and have chosen not too.
    Acquiring Reddit now wouldn’t create all that much value for a competing social
    platform.

    Potential acquirers will not likely have interest in paying anywhere close to
    the lofty IPO valuation for a business that will likely face significant challenges
    moving forward.
