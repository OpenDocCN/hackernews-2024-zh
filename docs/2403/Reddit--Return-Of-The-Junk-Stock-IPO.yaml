    today – a 97% downside to the reported IPO valuation. At Reddit’s current ARPU,
    this scenario implies Reddit has 437 million DAUs in 2033\. Even if I assume Reddit
    can double its ARPU, this scenario implies it has 218 million DAUs in 2033, or
    3x its 2023 DAUs.

    increasing working capital or fixed assets. This assumption is highly unlikely
    but allows me to create best-case scenarios that demonstrate the high level of
    expectations embedded in the reported IPO valuation.

    than they really are, in hopes of justifying a higher valuation, and Reddit is
    no different. Reddit provides investors with the popular Adjusted EBITDA metric.
    Not surprisingly, Adjusted EBITDA gives a more positive picture of the firm’s
    business than GAAP net income and Economic Earnings.

    compensation and $14 million in depreciation and amortization. After removing
    all items, Reddit reports adjusted EBITDA of -$69 million in 2023\. Meanwhile,
    GAAP net income is -$91 million while economic earnings are even lower at -$288
    million. See Figure 7.

    New investors will buy the A shares, which receive one vote per share, while existing
    investors will own shares that receive 10 votes per share. This super voting class
    gives existing shareholders significant say over corporate governance matters.

    given that Reddit’s initial S-1 lacks details around how many shares it will be
    selling and what that amount will mean in relation to existing shareholders, one
    thing is clear. New shareholders will not have much say in the corporate governance
    of the business.

- en: The expectations baked into Reddit’s reported IPO valuation look highly optimistic.
    Often, the best hope investors might have in overvalued stocks is for an established
    company to acquire the firm. However, investors shouldn’t get their hopes up.
    As noted above the competitors with the most cash already have larger user bases,
    with better monetization, and robust advertising platforms. Additionally, competition
    has had many years to acquire Reddit prior to this IPO and have chosen not too.
    Acquiring Reddit now wouldn’t create all that much value for a competing social
    platform.

    Potential acquirers will not likely have interest in paying anywhere close to
    the lofty IPO valuation for a business that will likely face significant challenges
    moving forward.
