    electronic waste has reached record highs and is growing five times faster than
    rates of recycling – bringing a host of health, environmental and climate problems,
    according to new analysis.

    of electronic waste, also known as “e-waste,” according to the [United Nations
    Global E-waste Monitor](http://www.globalewaste.org) released Wednesday.

    trucks which, if placed bumper-to-bumper, could form a line long enough to wrap

    and recycled, according to the report. Since 2010, the growth of e-waste has outpaced
    the growth of formal collection and recycling by a factor of almost five, the

    particularly low recycling rates at around 12%, despite making up roughly a third
    of all e-waste, the report found.

    air conditioning units and TV screens because of their size and associated health

    are extracted and processed in a highly energy-intensive process, mainly powered
    by fossil fuels. As demand ramps up, and people are persuaded to replace devices
    more often, the climate impact is growing.

    represents an immediate call for greater investment in infrastructure development,
    more promotion of repair and reuse, capacity building, and measures to stop illegal
