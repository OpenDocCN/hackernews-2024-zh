- en: Ozempic could be profitably produced for less than $5 a month even as maker
    Novo Nordisk A/S charges almost $1,000 in the US, according to a [study](http://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2024.3474?utm_source=For_The_Media&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=ftm_links&utm_term=032724) that

- en: The blockbuster drug could be manufactured for 89 cents to $4.73 for a month’s
    supply, figures that include a profit margin, researchers at Yale University,
    King’s College Hospital in London and the nonprofit Doctors Without Borders reported
    in the journal [JAMA Network Open](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen).
    That compares to the monthly US list price of $968.52 for Ozempic, a weekly injection.

- en: Novo declined to provide production costs for Ozempic and Wegovy, its related
    drug for obesity. The company said it’s making significant investments to ensure
    that the public has access to its widely popular drugs. It’s making about $6 billion
    in capital expenditures and spending $11 billion to acquire production facilities
    from Catalent Inc. as part of those efforts, according to an emailed response
    to questions.

    people and our entire health care system,” Senator Bernie Sanders, who has held
    hearings about high US drug prices, said in a statement after the findings came
    out. The Vermont independent called on Novo Nordisk to lower the list price of
    Ozempic to $155 a month or less, in line with what it charges in other [countries](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-01-30/ozempic-is-cheaper-in-mexico-here-s-why).

    like Ozempic and Wegovy and underlines longstanding criticism of prices for diabetes
    therapies, especially insulin. On a per-month basis, Ozempic generally can be
    produced for less than various forms of insulin, a lifesaving diabetes drug that’s
    been available for decades, the study found.

    a public health economist at Yale and the study’s corresponding author. “There

    linked to the drugs are likely to expire in June 2033, according to [estimates](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/ip-law/novo-nordisk-must-face-mylan-challenge-to-wegovy-ozempic-patent) from
    Bloomberg Law. Novo shares fell 0.8% in Copenhagen, and have gained 26% this year.

    they relate to prices, if at all. Barber and her colleagues used updated estimates
    for raw ingredient costs and focused on the costs of producing diabetes drugs,
    including GLP-1 drugs like Ozempic, along with other diabetes pills and insulins.

- en: Novo and other drugmakers slashed US prices for some forms of insulin by as
    much as 75% last year under pressure from the Biden administration. By some estimates,
    however, the reductions made those products more profitable because they eliminated
    rebates paid to pharmacy benefit managers, the middlemen who negotiate prices
    for payers and employers.

- en: Novo said in an email that 75% of its gross earnings goes to rebates and discounts
    to ensure patients have access to products like semaglutide, the active ingredient
    in Wegovy and Ozempic. Drugmakers often cite the high costs of research that may
    last years as a reason for their prices. Spending on drug research and development
    was almost $5 billion last year and will rise this year, Novo said.

- en: Still, debate over the cost of drugs like Ozempic and Wegovy is ramping up.
    State health plans and Medicaid offices are seeing growing bills for Ozempic and
    its sister drug Wegovy, raising questions about whether the increases in cost
    are sustainable. In January, North Carolina cut off coverage of anti-obesity medicines
    for state employees, citing soaring costs and lack of agreement on pricing from
    drugmakers.

- en: Surprisingly, the study found that the biggest cost in producing Ozempic is
    not the active medicine, called semaglutide, but the disposable pens used to inject
    it. They can be made for no more than $2.83 per month’s supply, the authors concluded,
    based on interviews with former employees and consultants to injection device
    manufacturers. One Ozempic pen is used weekly and lasts a month.

- en: By contrast, the active drug in Ozempic can be produced for about 29 cents for
    a month’s supply, or 7.2 cents for a typical weekly dose, the research found.
    It’s not cheap to make — semaglutide costs over $70,000 per kilogram. But only
    a tiny quantity of the drug is used in each weekly dose.

    dose, and other chemical ingredients, which the study estimates at 15 cents per
    monthly dose.

    the University of Liverpool and elsewhere found last year that Wegovy could be
    produced for a mere $40 a month.
