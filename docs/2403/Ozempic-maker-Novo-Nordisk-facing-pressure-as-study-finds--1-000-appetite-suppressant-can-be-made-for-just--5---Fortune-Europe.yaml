    Novo Nordisk A/S charges almost $1,000 in the US, according to a [study](http://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2024.3474?utm_source=For_The_Media&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=ftm_links&utm_term=032724) that

    supply, figures that include a profit margin, researchers at Yale University,
    King’s College Hospital in London and the nonprofit Doctors Without Borders reported
    in the journal [JAMA Network Open](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen).
    That compares to the monthly US list price of $968.52 for Ozempic, a weekly injection.

    drug for obesity. The company said it’s making significant investments to ensure
    that the public has access to its widely popular drugs. It’s making about $6 billion
    in capital expenditures and spending $11 billion to acquire production facilities
    from Catalent Inc. as part of those efforts, according to an emailed response
    to questions.

    people and our entire health care system,” Senator Bernie Sanders, who has held
    hearings about high US drug prices, said in a statement after the findings came
    out. The Vermont independent called on Novo Nordisk to lower the list price of
    Ozempic to $155 a month or less, in line with what it charges in other [countries](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-01-30/ozempic-is-cheaper-in-mexico-here-s-why).

    like Ozempic and Wegovy and underlines longstanding criticism of prices for diabetes
    therapies, especially insulin. On a per-month basis, Ozempic generally can be
    produced for less than various forms of insulin, a lifesaving diabetes drug that’s
    been available for decades, the study found.

    they relate to prices, if at all. Barber and her colleagues used updated estimates
    for raw ingredient costs and focused on the costs of producing diabetes drugs,
    including GLP-1 drugs like Ozempic, along with other diabetes pills and insulins.

- en: Novo and other drugmakers slashed US prices for some forms of insulin by as
    much as 75% last year under pressure from the Biden administration. By some estimates,
    however, the reductions made those products more profitable because they eliminated
    rebates paid to pharmacy benefit managers, the middlemen who negotiate prices
    for payers and employers.

  zh: 去年，受拜登政府压力，诺和及其他制药公司将某些胰岛素的美国价格降低了高达75%。然而，据一些估算，这些降价使得这些产品更具盈利性，因为取消了支付给药房福利管理人的折扣，后者是为支付者和雇主协商价格的中间人。
- en: Novo said in an email that 75% of its gross earnings goes to rebates and discounts
    to ensure patients have access to products like semaglutide, the active ingredient
    in Wegovy and Ozempic. Drugmakers often cite the high costs of research that may
    last years as a reason for their prices. Spending on drug research and development
    was almost $5 billion last year and will rise this year, Novo said.

  zh: 诺和发送的一封电子邮件中提到，其总收入的75%用于折扣和优惠，以确保患者能够获得类似Wegovy和Ozempic中活性成分semaglutide的产品。制药公司经常以长达数年的研究高成本为其定价的理由。诺和表示，去年在药物研发上的支出接近50亿美元，并将在今年继续增加。
- en: Still, debate over the cost of drugs like Ozempic and Wegovy is ramping up.
    State health plans and Medicaid offices are seeing growing bills for Ozempic and
    its sister drug Wegovy, raising questions about whether the increases in cost
    are sustainable. In January, North Carolina cut off coverage of anti-obesity medicines
    for state employees, citing soaring costs and lack of agreement on pricing from
    drugmakers.

  zh: 尽管如此，像Ozempic和Wegovy这样的药物成本的争论正在加剧。州级健康计划和医疗补助办公室的账单正在增加，针对Ozempic及其姐妹药物Wegovy，引发了有关成本上涨是否可持续的问题。今年1月，北卡罗来纳州因药品成本飙升及制药公司在定价上的缺乏一致性而中止了为州雇员提供抗肥胖药物的覆盖。
- en: Surprisingly, the study found that the biggest cost in producing Ozempic is
    not the active medicine, called semaglutide, but the disposable pens used to inject
    it. They can be made for no more than $2.83 per month’s supply, the authors concluded,
    based on interviews with former employees and consultants to injection device
    manufacturers. One Ozempic pen is used weekly and lasts a month.

  zh: 令人惊讶的是，研究发现，制造Ozempic最大的成本不是其活性成分semaglutide，而是用于注射的一次性笔。根据与注射设备制造商前雇员和顾问的访谈，每月供应的Ozempic笔的制造成本不超过2.83美元。一支Ozempic笔每周使用一次，持续一个月。

    a month’s supply, or 7.2 cents for a typical weekly dose, the research found.
    It’s not cheap to make — semaglutide costs over $70,000 per kilogram. But only
