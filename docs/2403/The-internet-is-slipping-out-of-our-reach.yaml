    you get paid search results, ads, third-party cookies, trackers, newsletter prompts,
    notification requests, and, if you're lucky – a movie review. No matter what you
    search for, SEO-hacked content farms will blot out the sun.

    that is—so it can monetize every fiber of your eyeballs. Keep you scrolling, clicking,
    and sharing. Like this article? Maybe you'll like this e-book too. It's free!

    has moved to a few select apps, which then [sell our words](https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/17/24075670/reddit-ai-training-license-deal-user-content)
    to AI slot machines. Images on Instagram, videos on YouTube, and discussions on
    Reddit. Dare to venture out of this bubble, and you'll be pelted with SEO spam
    by content farms squabbling over search ranks and impressions.

- en: With services that [generate thousands of articles](/assets/img/darker-internet/seo-heist.webp),
    post them on multiple websites, then create fake profiles to market them; the
    phrase "As an AI language model" now turns up on LinkedIn, Amazon, Twitter, and
    even Google scholar. In a matter of weeks, LLMs can generate more text than has
    ever been written in human history. Every passing day, humans grow farther apart,
    and bots fill the void in between.

- en: This steady decline hearkens me back to my early teenage years – when I was
    an active user of several RTS video-game forums. At the time, the internet was
    smaller and fostered organic growth. Smaller websites were easier to find, game
    mods and fanfics weren't subreddits, and personal pages didn't live on Substack
    or Medium.

    content, like the big bang leaving [a dark forest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_forest_hypothesis)
    behind. Online TV shows and webtoons with unending episodes generated on the fly,
    digital journals overflowing with articles, and chat apps with AI companions to
    ease loneliness. Human interaction will stay burrowed underground, in the tight
    confines of small and heavily moderated groups.

    place where I expect to freely interact with meaningful messages that aren't marketing
    posts in disguise. And if you too have been hiding in telegram groups and mailing
    lists – good, don't leave. It's dark outside.
