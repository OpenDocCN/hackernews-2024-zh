    is the same (\(2^{-20}\)), it proves that there was no foul-play involved. Bob
    credits his excellent luck. Alice is smart and cannot be easily convinced. She
    get’s back at Bob by claiming that probability cannot be used in this context
    as it reveals no information regarding the randomness of the obtained sequences.
    One can take a quick glance at the obtained sequences and easily point out that
    Alice’s sequence is more random than Bob’s sequence. Alice needs a way to describe
    how “hard to describe” or random a string/sequence is. However, this argument
    lacks mathematical rigor. In this post, we’ll help out Alice using a mathematical
    tool known as Kolmogorov Complexity.

    program outputting that string. The idea is that Kolmogorov complexity gives us
    a way to describe the randomness of a string. A string with its Kolmogorov complexity
    equal to the length of the string will be more random than the string with its
    Kolmogorov complexity less than the length of the string. Moreover, a string cannot
    be compressed if its $$KC(x) \geq |x|$$ Another thing to note is that Kolmogorov
    complexity of a string cannot be computed. There cannot exist a computer that
    will always guarantee the Kolmogorov complexity for all the strings. It is not
    a computational problem but rather a fundamentally theoretical one. To better
    understand that, take a look at the

    are interesting. 1 is the first number, so that is interesting. 2 is the first
    even number. 3 is the first odd prime number. 4 is interesting because 4=2×2 and
    4=2+2\. We can continue in this fashion and find interesting properties for many
    numbers. At some point we might come to some number that does not seem to have
    an interesting property. We can call that number the first uninteresting number.
    But that, in itself, is an interesting property. In conclusion, the uninteresting
    number is, in fact, interesting! [[source](https://nautil.us/kolmogorov-complexity-and-our-search-for-meaning-237158/)]

- en: Currently, we have a strong dependency on the type of language being used to
    describe the string and that doesn’t attest this mathematical representation with
    consistency. In other words, we need to define complexity such that the definition
    does not change based on the \(L\) we pick and depends only on the string. Changing
    from Python to Javascript in the example above changed our values. So, how do
    we generalize this and make it language-agnostic? To alleviate this issue, let’s
    assume that there exists a universal language \(U\) such that it always gives
    us the shortest description length for all strings. This would imply,

    \(U\) cannot exist or \(U\) cannot provide shorter descriptions than every arbitrary

    languages, allowing for the emergence of a single universal description method
