- en: As users have pointed out this week, while using Google's desktop browser on
    Windows 10 or 11, a dialog box suddenly and irritatingly appears to the side of
    the screen urging folks to make Microsoft's Bing the default search engine in
    Chrome.

    OpenAI GPT-4-powered chat bot, allowing them to ask questions and get answers
    using natural language. We can forgive those who thought this was malware at first
    glance.

    extension and changes the default search provider. Chrome alerts the user in another
    dialog box that something potentially malicious is trying to update their settings.
    Google's browser recommends you click on a "Change it back" button to undo the
    tweak.

    fair competition in the technology world – eg, Apple being forced in Europe to
    [display](https://www.theregister.com/2024/03/14/brave_mozilla_europe_ios/) a
    browser choice screen, boosting downloads of Safari rivals Firefox, Brave, and
    Vivaldi – and AI hype [barely moving](https://www.theregister.com/2024/01/18/bing_ai_search/)

    user choice screen that regulators are in favor of. It's just one that happens
    to jump out randomly. Too bad there's no option to prevent this from happening
    as far as we can tell – well, other than installing another operating system.

    netizens not to ditch its Edge browser on Google's own Chrome download page. Redmond
    also pushed Bing in Windows 11 via [pop-ups](https://www.theregister.com/2023/08/30/microsoft_windows_11_bing/),
    and recently had Edge automatically and unexpectedly [import](https://www.theregister.com/2024/01/30/microsoft_edge_tabs/)
    Chrome tabs for at least some people.
