    observed that frustrating, cognitively dissonant things were the first to slip
    his memory. This is Johanna’s impression, too. If she doesn’t note those reactions
    immediately, they slip her by. It is like a rabbit that shoots up from the grass
    when you walk in the meadow. “You have to grab hold of her when she leaps,” Johanna
    writes in the margin of a draft. “And then you skin her quick.”

    so you can see if it contains information that will help further the work. Let
    me give you an example. In the first version of this essay, we talked about “finding
    bottlenecks.” It was about what in management is known as the theory of constraint.
    But something about this felt off to Johanna. Why was that? A bottleneck refers
    to the slowest station on a production line, which, because production is linear,
    sets the speed of the entire line. To speed up production, you have to find the
    bottleneck and ease it. But is that a good metaphor for the types of things we
    are talking about? Does essay writing have bottlenecks like that? Does being a
    good partner? Bottlenecks form when there are clearly separated tasks that follow
    each other in a set order. Most things are not like this. In writing, it is quite
    possible to start typing before you’ve done the tasks that should come before
    it, and, besides, I’m never sure how to tell if the preparation is finished or
    not. In other words, the reason talking about bottlenecks felt off was that it
    mapped badly to the problems we cared about. So we went back to the drawing board.

    I don’t act on that thought. Instead, I tell Johanna about the problem. Then I
    put on my jacket and go see if the cranes are passing by going north (one of Johanna’s
    flaws is that she forgets that people get upset by these kinds of things, so I
    need some time alone before I can talk about it). *Why did I fail? The narrative

    what to do with the six acres we now had to tend. She knew nothing about gardening,
    but from suddenly having land she was attracted by the challenge of using it well.
    She had begun teaching herself garden design a few months before by skimming textbooks,
    handbooks, overviews, and so on—working through 10 to 20 books, in a month or
    two. She was mapping the field. Between her reading sessions, she would walk our
    grounds. She observed the forest of maple, pine, and oak; the meadow; and the
    spaces around the houses, to get a sense of what areas of gardening and design
    were relevant in our context.

    the design problems we faced to her satisfaction. There was something she lacked.

    fit. It was well-integrated on all levels Johanna could perceive—the colors, the

    sat perfectly in the landscape, the larger wholeness.

    of diary-like pieces detailing his process and work), as well as every interview
    and lecture available, and, first and foremost, pictures and films of the gardens.
    Each source in itself was of limited use. You can’t learn gardening from an interview,
    or from looking at pictures. But the sources were* limited in different ways*,
    so bouncing between them, they illuminated each other. A lecture could highlight
    patterns in a garden that Johanna had failed to see; while carefully studying
    hundreds of pictures from the same garden could bring out things that Pearson’s
    words only gestured at. Johanna would imitate what Pearson described doing which
    was also illuminating—going out into our fields looking, making trial beds, and
    sketching in the way he does—it helped her test her understanding and opened questions

    you want to grow, it is important to think about what kind of energy you project
    when asking for feedback, so that people feel comfortable giving care in a demanding
    way, and so they know at what level you want to be seen. Most people will default
    to giving praise and pointing out surface-level details. It is up to you to prompt
    them to reveal deeper problems.'

- en: It took Johanna and me a few years to figure out how to be sincere about the
    flaws we saw in each other. I’m not sure what changed to make it less uncomfortable.
    Partly it was exposure training, I guess. If you get enough feedback, you figure
    out that having your failures pointed out doesn’t hurt you. It is just data.

- en: But there was also a deeper mental shift for me. I transferred my loyalty away
    from the thing in front of me and toward what I *could* achieve. Much as working
    with a piano teacher is not, fundamentally, about learning songs, but about using
    songs to push yourself; I now think of our projects, not as ends in themselves,
    but as means to help us improve the underlying process and ourselves. This helps
    put me in the right frame of mind. I want this essay to turn out well, of course.
    But the goal of being honest with each other when we examine the drafts isn’t
    to figure out how to make a particular draft work, but to see what deeper possibilities
    it points out and then pursue those, even if it means trashing the draft.

    and our fumbling attempts at being sincere with each other, I feel a deep gratitude
    toward them. When they found their limitations, they could transcend them, and
    this brought us into being. We have the same responsibility to the people we will
    be a year from now. Looking for limitations is about [extending care to your future

    what we need to do next to keep growing. What are we not seeing? We spell out
    what we are trying to achieve and how we go about it; we study others; we give
    and take feedback. Then we write it all down in this essay, to see if you can
    help us see more clearly.
