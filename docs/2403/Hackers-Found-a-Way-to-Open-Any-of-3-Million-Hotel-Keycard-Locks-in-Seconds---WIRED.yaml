- en: When thousands of security researchers descend on Las Vegas every August for
    what's come to be known as “hacker summer camp,” the back-to-back [Black Hat](https://www.wired.com/tag/black-hat/)
    and [Defcon](https://www.wired.com/tag/defcon/) hacker conferences, it's a given
    that some of them will experiment with hacking the infrastructure of Vegas itself,
    the city's elaborate array of [casino](https://www.wired.com/story/card-shuffler-hack/)
    and [hospitality](https://www.wired.com/story/elevator-phone-phreaking-defcon/)
    technology. But at one private event in 2022, a select group of researchers were
    actually *invited* to hack a Vegas hotel room, competing in a suite crowded with
    their laptops and cans of Red Bull to find digital vulnerabilities in every one
    of the room's gadgets, from its TV to its bedside VoIP phone.

    perhaps its most sensitive piece of technology of all. Now, more than a year and
    a half later, they''re finally bringing to light the results of that work: a technique
    they discovered that would allow an intruder to open any of millions of hotel
    rooms worldwide in seconds, with just two taps.'

- en: Today, Ian Carroll, Lennert Wouters, and a team of other security researchers
    are revealing a hotel keycard hacking technique they call [Unsaflok](https://unsaflok.com/).
    The technique is a collection of security vulnerabilities that would allow a hacker
    to almost instantly open several models of Saflok-brand RFID-based keycard locks
    sold by the Swiss lock maker Dormakaba. The Saflok systems are installed on 3
    million doors worldwide, inside 13,000 properties in 131 countries.

- en: By exploiting weaknesses in both Dormakaba's encryption and the underlying RFID
    system Dormakaba uses, known as MIFARE Classic, Carroll and Wouters have demonstrated
    just how easily they can open a Saflok keycard lock. Their technique starts with
    obtaining any keycard from a target hotel—say, by booking a room there or grabbing
    a keycard out of a box of used ones—then reading a certain code from that card
    with a $300 RFID read-write device, and finally writing two keycards of their
    own. When they merely tap those two cards on a lock, the first rewrites a certain
    piece of the lock's data, and the second opens it.

    Security and Industrial Cryptography group at the KU Leuven University in Belgium.
    “And that works on every door in the hotel.”

- en: Wouters and Carroll, an independent security researcher and founder of travel
    website Seats.aero, shared the full technical details of their hacking technique
    with Dormakaba in November 2022\. Dormakaba says that it's been working since
    early last year to make hotels that use Saflok aware of their security flaws and
    to help them fix or replace the vulnerable locks. For many of the Saflok systems
    sold in the last eight years, there's no hardware replacement necessary for each
    individual lock. Instead, hotels will only need to update or replace the front
    desk management system and have a technician carry out a relatively quick reprogramming
    of each lock, door by door.

- en: Wouters and Carroll say they were nonetheless told by Dormakaba that, as of
    this month, only 36 percent of installed Safloks have been updated. Given that
    the locks aren't connected to the internet and some older locks will still need
    a hardware upgrade, they say the full fix will still likely take months longer
    to roll out, at the very least. Some older installations may take years.

    mitigation for this vulnerability, along with a longer-term solution,” Dormakaba
    wrote to WIRED in a statement, though it declined to detail what that “immediate
    mitigation” might be. “Our customers and partners all take security very seriously,
    and we are confident all reasonable steps will be taken to address this matter
    in a responsible way.”
