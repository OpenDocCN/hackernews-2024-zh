    what's come to be known as “hacker summer camp,” the back-to-back [Black Hat](https://www.wired.com/tag/black-hat/)
    and [Defcon](https://www.wired.com/tag/defcon/) hacker conferences, it's a given
    that some of them will experiment with hacking the infrastructure of Vegas itself,
    the city's elaborate array of [casino](https://www.wired.com/story/card-shuffler-hack/)
    and [hospitality](https://www.wired.com/story/elevator-phone-phreaking-defcon/)
    technology. But at one private event in 2022, a select group of researchers were
    actually *invited* to hack a Vegas hotel room, competing in a suite crowded with
    their laptops and cans of Red Bull to find digital vulnerabilities in every one
    of the room's gadgets, from its TV to its bedside VoIP phone.

- en: Today, Ian Carroll, Lennert Wouters, and a team of other security researchers
    are revealing a hotel keycard hacking technique they call [Unsaflok](https://unsaflok.com/).
    The technique is a collection of security vulnerabilities that would allow a hacker
    to almost instantly open several models of Saflok-brand RFID-based keycard locks
    sold by the Swiss lock maker Dormakaba. The Saflok systems are installed on 3
    million doors worldwide, inside 13,000 properties in 131 countries.

  zh: 今天，伊恩·卡罗尔、莱纳特·沃特斯及其它安全研究人员团队正揭示了一种名为 [Unsaflok](https://unsaflok.com/) 的酒店门卡黑客技术。这项技术是一系列安全漏洞的集合，可以让黑客几乎立即打开瑞士锁业公司Dormakaba销售的几种型号的Saflok品牌RFID门卡锁。这些Saflok系统安装在全球300万扇门上，分布在131个国家的13000个地产内。
- en: By exploiting weaknesses in both Dormakaba's encryption and the underlying RFID
    system Dormakaba uses, known as MIFARE Classic, Carroll and Wouters have demonstrated
    just how easily they can open a Saflok keycard lock. Their technique starts with
    obtaining any keycard from a target hotel—say, by booking a room there or grabbing
    a keycard out of a box of used ones—then reading a certain code from that card
    with a $300 RFID read-write device, and finally writing two keycards of their
    own. When they merely tap those two cards on a lock, the first rewrites a certain
    piece of the lock's data, and the second opens it.

  zh: 通过利用Dormakaba加密和底层RFID系统（称为MIFARE Classic）的弱点，Carroll和Wouters展示了他们可以多么轻松地打开Saflok门卡锁。他们的技术始于获取目标酒店的任何门卡
    —— 比如通过预订一间房间或从使用过的门卡盒中拿出一张门卡 —— 然后使用一台价值300美元的RFID读写设备读取该卡的某个代码，并最终写入两张自己的门卡。当他们仅仅轻触这两张卡时，第一张重新写入锁的某个数据，第二张将其打开。

- en: Wouters and Carroll, an independent security researcher and founder of travel
    website Seats.aero, shared the full technical details of their hacking technique
    with Dormakaba in November 2022\. Dormakaba says that it's been working since
    early last year to make hotels that use Saflok aware of their security flaws and
    to help them fix or replace the vulnerable locks. For many of the Saflok systems
    sold in the last eight years, there's no hardware replacement necessary for each
    individual lock. Instead, hotels will only need to update or replace the front
    desk management system and have a technician carry out a relatively quick reprogramming
    of each lock, door by door.

  zh: Wouters 和 Carroll，一位独立安全研究员和旅行网站 Seats.aero 的创始人，于 2022 年 11 月与 Dormakaba 分享了他们的黑客技术的全部技术细节。Dormakaba
    表示，自去年初以来，他们一直在努力使使用 Saflok 的酒店意识到其安全漏洞，并帮助它们修复或更换易受攻击的门锁。对于过去八年销售的许多 Saflok 系统，不需要为每个单独的锁更换硬件。相反，酒店只需更新或更换前台管理系统，并由技术人员逐门进行相对快速的重新编程。
- en: Wouters and Carroll say they were nonetheless told by Dormakaba that, as of
    this month, only 36 percent of installed Safloks have been updated. Given that
    the locks aren't connected to the internet and some older locks will still need
    a hardware upgrade, they say the full fix will still likely take months longer
    to roll out, at the very least. Some older installations may take years.

  zh: Wouters 和 Carroll 表示，尽管如此，Dormakaba 告知他们，截至本月，只有安装的 Saflok 的 36% 已经更新。考虑到这些锁没有连接到互联网，一些较老的锁仍然需要硬件升级，他们说完全修复可能至少还需要数月的时间才能推出。一些较旧的安装可能需要几年的时间。
- en: “We have worked closely with our partners to identify and implement an immediate
    mitigation for this vulnerability, along with a longer-term solution,” Dormakaba
    wrote to WIRED in a statement, though it declined to detail what that “immediate
    mitigation” might be. “Our customers and partners all take security very seriously,
    and we are confident all reasonable steps will be taken to address this matter
    in a responsible way.”
