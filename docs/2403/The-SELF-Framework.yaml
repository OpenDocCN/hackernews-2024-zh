- en: When looking for a job that “makes an impact,” you may run into quite a few
    positions that sound good but don’t make much of a difference in practice.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For instance, you might find a job that tackles a big global problem like [climate
    change](https://probablygood.org/cause-areas/climate-change/overview/) (great!)
    but because the organization uses funds inefficiently and the role involves a
    lot of meaningless busy work, you end up not doing much good. Or maybe a start
    up claims it will make a positive impact on the world, but it turns out that the
    real goal is to increase profits.

    world?

- en: The SELF framework—which we [explore in detail](https://www.probablygood.org/career-guide)
    in our career guide—is a simple tool to help you assess a specific role’s potential
    for improving the world. Below, we’ll summarize four major factors that could
    influence your impact. We recommend taking the time to consider each factor carefully.
    Doing so could sharpen your intuition about what makes for an impactful job, even
    if you come up against some uncertainty along the way.

    you can often make a much bigger impact on the world by choosing to focus on the
    [most significant](https://probablygood.org/career-guide/analyzing-cause-areas/)problems.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There are a lot of ways to think about a problem’s scope and scale. You could
    think of a problem’s significance as the extent to which it causes unhappiness,
    suffering, or a lower quality of life. It could also incorporate the extent to
    which the problem goes against your values—for example, a problem that causes
    harm to the environment or that perpetuates social inequalities.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Just as problems vary in significance, solutions vary in effectiveness. And
    no matter how significant a problem may be, an ineffective method will do little
    to solve it. But what makes a method—that is, the means you’ll use to tackle the
    problem—especially effective?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'An effective method is both efficient and scalable; it uses fewer resources
    per impactful output. Yet even if a method is efficient, it’s not guaranteed to
    be successful. For example, sometimes a big policy change is the most efficient
    method for improving a problem. If a policy is passed, it can have an outsized
    impact. However, policy change involves a lot of moving parts. It’s not guaranteed
    that advocating for a change will actually lead to one. It’s important, then,
    to consider the likelihood of a method’s success in practice. Here are just a
    few questions to help you think through a method’s efficacy:'

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The significance of the problem and efficacy of the solution often have to do
    with the whole organization’s efforts to do good. When considering jobs, we need
    to also think about the specific role you would take. In other words, what does
    this role do within the organization and how important is that work?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    has on the impact the organization or company is trying to make. Some roles are
    extremely critical to accomplishing an overall goal or solving a problem, while
    others may not actually contribute much in practice. It’s not always clear whether
    a role has leverage within an organization, and it often depends on the specific
    situation. Some questions to help gain some intuition on a role’s leverage include:'
