    — conditions that affect the entire body — is remarkable. For starters, three
    common dental issues — cavities, tooth loss and periodontal disease — are all
    associated with heart disease, the leading cause of death in the United States.
    “To me, the number one hidden risk factor for the number one killer in our country
    is oral health,” says Ellie Campbell, a family physician in Cumming, Georgia,

    the teeth, is the main culprit. Nearly half of adults 30 and older have periodontal
    disease; by age 65, the rate climbs to about 70 percent. In the early stages,
    called gingivitis, gums are swollen and may bleed. Periodontitis, a more serious
    condition in which gums can pull away from the teeth, is the sixth most common
    human disease.

    by unregulated and inadequately trained itinerants, says medical and dental historian
    Andrew I. Spielman, a dentist and oral surgeon at the New York University College

    dentist fixes their gums,’” she says. “And the dentist is going to say, ‘Well,

    seem. A decade ago, the federal government hired the [National Network for Oral
    Health Access](https://www.nnoha.org/) to run a pilot program merging oral and

    is one of them. While more than 90 percent of Americans have health insurance,
    only 77 percent of US adults ages 19 to 64 have dental coverage, which typically
    is sold separately from health insurance. The nation’s largest insurer — the federal
    Medicare program — generally does [not cover dental services](https://www.kff.org/medicare/issue-brief/medicare-and-dental-coverage-a-closer-look/),

    be covered by insurance but who cannot afford the dental work that is needed in

    have almost no training in oral health. A 2009 survey found that 10 percent of
    medical schools that responded offered [no oral health curriculum](https://journals.lww.com/academicmedicine/fulltext/2011/02000/teaching_oral_health_in_u_s__medical_schools_.23.aspx),

    health records used by physicians are incompatible with those used by dentists,

    might be easier.

    help to prevent heart problems? Several observational studies, in which researchers
    observe individuals and measure particular outcomes, but don’t intervene, suggest
    that oral health care, including toothbrushing and dental cleanings, make a difference.
    For example, a study that tracked the health habits of 11,869 adults 35 and older
    in Scotland found that within eight years, those who [rarely brushed their teeth
