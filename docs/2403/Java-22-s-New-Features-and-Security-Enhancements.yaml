    standard API for parsing, generating, and transforming Java class files. It is
    intended to enable JDK components to migrate to the standard API and eventually
    remove the JDK’s internal copy of the third-party [ASM](https://asm.ow2.io/?ref=coderoasis.com) library.
    Parsing, generating, and transforming class files is ubiquitous, used by independent
    tools and libraries to examine and extend programs without jeopardizing maintainability
    of source code.

    due to standard Java’s six-month release cadence. This speed of evolution has
    resulted in frameworks more frequently encountering class files that are newer
    than the class-file library. This has resulted in errors and in framework developers
    trying to write code to parse class files from the future and hoping nothing too
    serious will change. The plan is to have the Java platform define and implement
    a standard class-file API to evolve together with the class-file format.

    intended to reduce latency, so that garbage collection (GC) need not be disabled
    during Java Native Interface (JNI) critical regions. Goals include no stalling
    of threads due to critical JNI regions, no added latency to start garbage collection
    due to these regions, no regressions in GC pause times when none of these regions
    are active, and minimal regressions in GC pause times when these regions are active.
    Currently, the default GC, G1, disables garbage collection during every critical
    region, which can have a significant impact on latency. With this change, Java
    threads will never wait for a G1 GC operation to complete.'

    key, which can either be private or public. Existing `java.security.PublicKey` and `java.security.PrivateKey` classes
    have been retrofitted to be sub interfaces of `AsymmetricKey`. As future asymmetric
    algorithms are introduced, the `AsymmetricKey` interface will allow earlier versions
    of Java SE to more easily support new asymmetric algorithms representing parameters
    as a `NamedParameterSpec`, Mullan said.
