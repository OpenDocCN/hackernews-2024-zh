    Polls showed a [50-22% overall margin in support of a ban](https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2023/03/31/by-a-more-than-two-to-one-margin-americans-support-us-government-banning-tiktok/)
    and 70-14% among conservatives. But Congress [couldn’t](https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/118/s686/summary)
    get the [RESTRICT Act](https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/118/s686/summary)

    passage of the TikTok ban represents a perfect storm of unpleasant political developments,
    putting congress back fully in line with the national security establishment on
    speech. After years of public championing of the First Amendment, congressional
    Republicans have suddenly and dramatically been brought back into the fold. Meanwhile
    Democrats, who stand to lose a lot from the bill politically — it’s opposed by
    73% of TikTok users, precisely the young voters whose defections since October
    put Joe Biden’s campaign into a tailspin — are spinning passage of the legislation
    to its base by suggesting it’s [not really happening](https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2024/03/13/is-tiktok-banned-what-to-know/72957680007/).

    is how Nancy Pelosi put it. Congress, the theory goes, will force TikTok to divest,
    some kindly Wall Street consortium will gobble it up (“It’s a great business and
    I’m going to put together a group to buy TikTok,” Steve Mnuchin [told CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/14/former-treasury-secretary-mnuchin-is-putting-together-an-investor-group-to-buy-tiktok.html)),

    the bill was fast-tracked after a secret “intelligence community briefing” of
    Congress led by the [FBI](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/fbi), [Department of
    Justice](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/department-justice), and the [Office of
    the Director of National Intelligence](https://www.dni.gov/) (ODNI). The magazine
    noted that if everything goes as planned, the bill will give Biden the authority
    to shut down an app used by 150 million Americans just in time for the November
    elections.

    This Week* co-host Walter Kirn notes, the bill would give a potential future President
    Donald Trump “[unprecedented powers to censor and control the internet](https://twitter.com/walterkirn/status/1768330807280861649).”
    If *that* still doesn’t bother you, you’re either not worried about the election,
    or you’ve been overstating your fear of “dictatorial” Trump.

    era evolve. In 2004 the George W. Bush administration [defined](https://www.amnesty.org/en/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/amr510382009en.pdf)
    “enemy combatant” as “an individual who was part of or supporting Taliban or al
    Qaeda forces, or associated forces that are engaged in hostilities against the
    United States.” Yet in oral arguments of *Rosul et al v Bush* later that year,
    the government conceded an enemy combatant could be a “[little old lady in Switzerland](https://chicagounbound.uchicago.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1403&context=uclf)”
    who “wrote a check” to what she thought was an orphanage.

    to “hostilities against the United States” was dropped, including the United States
    part. Though Barack Obama [eliminated](https://www.amnesty.org/en/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/amr510382009en.pdf)
    the term “enemy combatant” in 2009, the government retained (and retains) a claim
    of authority to do basically whatever it wants, when it comes to capturing and
    detaining people deemed national security threats. You can expect a similar progression
    with speech controls.

    the Supreme Court — this TikTok bill has allowed the intelligence community to
    re-capture the legislative branch. Just a few principled speech defenders are
    left now. [Fifty Democrats](https://clerk.house.gov/evs/2024/roll086.xml#N) voted
    against the bill, which is heartening, although virtually none argued against
    it on First Amendment grounds, whis is infurating. Pramila Jayapal had a [typical
    take](https://jayapal.house.gov/2024/03/13/jayapal-statement-on-no-vote-on-tiktok-legislation/),

    for having donors connected to TikTok. Paul has been consistent in his defense
    of speech throughout his career, so the idea that his opinion on this matter is
    bought is ludicrous. It’s a relief to be able to expect at least some adherence
    to principle on this topic from him or [fellow Kentuckian Thomas Massie](https://www.nbcnews.com/video/gop-rep-massie-says-tiktok-bill-would-not-address-root-problems-206434373736),

    is so dangerous, the moment so suddenly and unexpectedly grave, that we both recommend
    anyone who can find the time to call or write their Senators to express opposition
    to [any coming Senate vote](https://rollcall.com/2024/03/14/schumer-signals-slower-pace-on-tiktok-measure-in-the-senate/).
    It might help. Yes, collection of personal information and content manipulation
    by the Chinese government (or Russia’s, or ours) are serious problems, but the
    wider view is the speech emergency. As the cliché goes, forget the furniture.
    The house is on fire. Let’s hope we’re not too late.
