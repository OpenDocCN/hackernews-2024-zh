- en: In case you missed it, there's been a lot of discourse surrounding electric
    vehicles and tires lately. Not only do EVs wear through their rubber and [roads](https://www.thedrive.com/news/32810/switching-to-electric-vehicles-will-ruin-our-roads-without-a-gas-tax-replacement)
    quicker because of [their relatively extreme heft](https://www.thedrive.com/news/40657/the-gmc-hummer-ev-pickup-will-weigh-9046-pounds-report),
    but the instant power they put down also accelerates the process. Owners are shocked
    to learn this firsthand because, as [J.D. Power](https://www.jdpower.com/business/press-releases/2024-us-original-equipment-tire-customer-satisfaction-study)
    reports, their daily drivers chew through tires like they're going out of style.
    And not only that, but many were supposedly never told this would happen.

  zh: 近期，围绕电动车和轮胎的讨论颇多，如果你错过了的话。电动车不仅因为其相对较高的重量而更快磨损其橡胶和[道路](https://www.thedrive.com/news/32810/switching-to-electric-vehicles-will-ruin-our-roads-without-a-gas-tax-replacement)，而且它们的瞬时动力也加速了这一过程。车主们第一手经历这一点时感到震惊，因为正如[J.D.
    Power](https://www.jdpower.com/business/press-releases/2024-us-original-equipment-tire-customer-satisfaction-study)所报告的，他们的日常驾驶会像过时品一样迅速消耗轮胎。不仅如此，许多人据称从未被告知这种情况会发生。
- en: This points to a few failings in the car buying process. Since J.D. Power's
    studies show that EV owners typically anticipate [similar tire wear](https://www.thedrive.com/guides-and-gear/michelin-knows-exactly-when-your-tires-will-wear-out)
    as internal combustion car owners, it shows that [adoption has leapfrogged education](https://www.thedrive.com/news/were-finally-crossing-the-chasm-with-electric-vehicles).
    This can be true for both buyers and sellers at new car dealerships. For instance,
    all the automaker buzz about EVs tends to blind customers to the potential downsides,
    and salespeople may be unaware or unwilling to share what they know about differences
    with electric car ownership.

Power的研究显示，电动车车主通常预期会像内燃汽车车主一样面对[类似的轮胎磨损](https://www.thedrive.com/guides-and-gear/michelin-knows-exactly-when-your-tires-will-wear-out)，这表明[采纳已经超越了教育](https://www.thedrive.com/news/were-finally-crossing-the-chasm-with-electric-vehicles)。这对于新车经销商的买家和销售人员都可能是真实的。例如，关于电动车的所有汽车制造商热潮往往会让客户对潜在的不利因素视而不见，而销售人员可能不知道或不愿意分享他们对电动车拥有不同体验的了解。

- en: “The widening satisfaction gap between EVs and gas-powered vehicles highlights
    an opportunity for tire manufacturers and automakers to educate EV owners on the
    differences in performance. Additionally, because of the inherent conflict of
    maximizing vehicle range and optimizing tire wear for EVs, tire manufacturers
    and automakers need to work together to overcome the challenge without completely
    sacrificing tire performance in other areas, especially as the EV market continues
    to increase.”

    deal with such egregious wear, but considering most service shops recommend oil
    changes every 5,000 miles on gasoline-powered cars, the comparison checks out
    in that case.
