- en: In case you missed it, there's been a lot of discourse surrounding electric
    vehicles and tires lately. Not only do EVs wear through their rubber and [roads](https://www.thedrive.com/news/32810/switching-to-electric-vehicles-will-ruin-our-roads-without-a-gas-tax-replacement)
    quicker because of [their relatively extreme heft](https://www.thedrive.com/news/40657/the-gmc-hummer-ev-pickup-will-weigh-9046-pounds-report),
    but the instant power they put down also accelerates the process. Owners are shocked
    to learn this firsthand because, as [J.D. Power](https://www.jdpower.com/business/press-releases/2024-us-original-equipment-tire-customer-satisfaction-study)
    reports, their daily drivers chew through tires like they're going out of style.
    And not only that, but many were supposedly never told this would happen.

    studies show that EV owners typically anticipate [similar tire wear](https://www.thedrive.com/guides-and-gear/michelin-knows-exactly-when-your-tires-will-wear-out)
    as internal combustion car owners, it shows that [adoption has leapfrogged education](https://www.thedrive.com/news/were-finally-crossing-the-chasm-with-electric-vehicles).
    This can be true for both buyers and sellers at new car dealerships. For instance,
    all the automaker buzz about EVs tends to blind customers to the potential downsides,
    and salespeople may be unaware or unwilling to share what they know about differences
    with electric car ownership.

- en: “The widening satisfaction gap between EVs and gas-powered vehicles highlights
    an opportunity for tire manufacturers and automakers to educate EV owners on the
    differences in performance. Additionally, because of the inherent conflict of
    maximizing vehicle range and optimizing tire wear for EVs, tire manufacturers
    and automakers need to work together to overcome the challenge without completely
    sacrificing tire performance in other areas, especially as the EV market continues
    to increase.”

    cars. Marketing is one reason, of course, but so are [the legitimately different
    requirements of EV tires](https://www.thedrive.com/sponsored/grounded-why-ev-specific-tires-are-more-than-marketing-hype).
    They must strike a different balance of strength, weight, and resiliency without
    hampering vehicle range or causing excessive noise. That's a tall task when you're
    dealing with [6,000-pound sedans](https://www.thedrive.com/news/honda-solid-state-batteries-will-offer-same-energy-density-at-half-the-weight)
    and "midsize" trucks that weigh as much as a dually pickup.

    in late 2023\. In it, [one respondent said](https://www.wardsauto.com/dealers/tires-are-new-oil-change)
    that “when it comes to EVs, tires are the new oil change." We [published a story
    last August](https://www.thedrive.com/news/rivians-tires-are-wearing-out-in-as-little-as-6000-miles-heres-why)
    about Rivian R1Ts needing new rubber after as few as 6,000 miles. Not all EV owners
    deal with such egregious wear, but considering most service shops recommend oil
    changes every 5,000 miles on gasoline-powered cars, the comparison checks out
    in that case.

    has a long way to go in educating customers about the upsides and downsides while
    also developing products that provide better value for folks. The thing is, there
    has to be an incentive for companies to do so, and at a time [when it's difficult
    enough to sell EVs as it is](https://www.thedrive.com/news/slowing-demand-is-making-used-evs-more-affordable-but-theyre-still-not-cheap),
