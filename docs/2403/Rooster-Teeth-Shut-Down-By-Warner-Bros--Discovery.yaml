    Teeth last fall relocated its content from YouTube to its own website. A potential

    dreamers and doers have introduced and grown what made Rooster Teeth stand out:
    animation, comedy, and gaming. From new forms of animated comedy with machinima
    to countless viral memes, including the Immortal Snail (aka Snail Assassin), to
    a US-born animated series embraced by Japan as anime, and record-breaking (at
    the time) crowdfunded movies. You’ve accomplished so much and made dreams come
    true here. You’ve turned original IP into video games, comic books, and VTubers.
    You’ve directed short videos, mo-cap, and films. You’ve puppeteered, hosted podcasts,
    and have built a thriving community that spans the globe. Your creativity knows
    no bounds, and you’ll continue contributing significantly to culture wherever
    your paths may take you.'

    business and was a dynamic movement that shaped the bond between communities,
    creators, and storytelling. Our founders didn’t have a blueprint for a media empire,
    but they got close to building one alongside a community that fueled its remarkable
    growth. In its earliest days, RT relied on community sponsorship through time,
    dollars, and unwavering passion. Volunteers evolved into staff, and the snowball
    effect grew, resulting in new relationships, marriages, births, and shared experiences
    that have changed lives.

    media models. We inspired generations of creators across streaming, machinima,
    animation, let’s plays, merch drops, touring, podcasting, and more. Companies
    like GameStop, YouTube, Facebook, Spotify, and TikTok asked us to collaborate
    with them in their earliest days because we set a standard for what a digital-first
    brand could be. We boldly took our content beyond screens and into community-driven
    experiences.

    end; it reflects broader business dynamics. Monetization shifts, platform algorithms,
    advertising challenges, and the ebb and flow of patronage—all these converging
    factors have led to many closures in the industry. While we learn about updates
    on programming day by day, we will share our plans for shows, franchises, partnerships,
    and merch soon and share those updates with teams internally and with the community
    on RoosterTeeth.com.
