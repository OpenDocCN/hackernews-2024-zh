    to build its first high-speed rail line from Beijing to Tianjin in 2004, China’s
    Ministry of Railways (now called China Railway) solicited bids from foreign train
    manufacturers, like Siemens and Alstom. These foreign trainmakers were facing
    mature markets at home with little potential for future growth. **China’s pitch
    was simple: we’re about to pour unimaginable sums of money into building a national
    high-speed rail system—the foreign firms who help at this early stage will be
    well-positioned to get a piece of this potentially massive market.**'

    a Chinese firm and jointly produce trainsets in China. In the process, each foreign
    trainmaker agreed to transfer certain technology and manufacturing know-how to
    their Chinese partners. Of course, the Germans will say they never gave away their
    core technology, like the train control software. But it was the whole range of
    production-related knowledge that mattered, down to even the smallest technical
    skills like how to weld properly.

    strong evidence that it does. A [recent study of China’s auto industry](https://voxdev.org/topic/firms-trade/did-joint-ventures-help-chinas-automobile-industry),
    where China also used this kind of “market access for technology” exchange, found
    that joint ventures with foreign automakers didn’t just improve Chinese-made cars.
    They improved each Chinese automaker’s cars in the areas where the foreign partner
    was strongest. Chinese automakers that partnered with Japanese brands tended to
    be more fuel-efficient. Chinese automakers that partnered with German brands tended
    to have stronger engine performance. **Technology and know-how are a kind of DNA
    that gets passed down through these partnerships.**

    is unique in some important ways. Most countries don’t have such a giant domestic
    market to entice foreign firms with. Also, when the Chinese state says they’re
    going all-in on something as big as a national high-speed rail network, they really
    mean it—and foreign firms believe them. But there are some countries, like India,
    that might seem well-positioned to use this same strategy. Yet when I spoke with
    people familiar with India’s effort to build its first high-speed rail line, for
    example, they were frustrated that India didn’t do more to get technology and
    know-how from their Japanese partners.'

    domestic firms with experience in train manufacturing and railway construction.
    It also had research centers and national laboratories focused on the science
    and engineering of high-speed rail. During my fieldwork, I talked with researchers
    at [Southwest Jiaotong University](https://en.swjtu.edu.cn/RESEARCH/Centers_Labs_Institutes.htm)
    in Chengdu, which has several labs dedicated to research on core high-speed rail
    engineering problems like traction and suspension. These researchers often had
    expertise in related areas, such as aerodynamics and vibration control from the
    world of aerospace engineering.

    technology stretching back to the 1960s when Chinese researchers were trying to
    develop solar power for satellites at the [Institute of Semiconductors](http://english.semi.cas.cn/),
    part of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. When Chinese private firms started to
    enter the solar industry in force in the 2000s, they relied heavily on imported
    turnkey manufacturing equipment from countries like Germany. As they faced growing
    bottlenecks in the supply of polysilicon, the main ingredient for solar cells,
    China’s solar industry might’ve stalled. But instead, they were able to move up
    the value chain to more complex polysilicon production in part because China already
    had a scientific knowledge base in this area from trying to develop silicon wafers
    for semiconductor chips. Today, China dominates every stage of the solar manufacturing
    process.

    that’s an industry leader or pioneer, like Apple or Tesla. If you’re going to
    spread know-how to your own domestic firms, it might as well come from the best-in-class
    foreign firms. Give them generous inducements to come, like subsidies and land.
    Don’t be stingy—see this as a long-term investment in your broader economy. Do
    whatever it takes to make their Chinese factories a success, like helping to cut
    through red tape. Then push these foreign firms hard to develop your own domestic
    firms as suppliers.
