- en: After three decades of attempts, the Environmental Protection Agency has banned
    the only form of asbestos still in use — part of a family of toxic minerals linked
    to lung cancer and other illnesses that cause about 40,000 U.S. deaths each year,
    the agency says.

- en: The EPA on Monday formally prohibited the import and use of chrysotile asbestos,
    the last type of asbestos that U.S. industries use. The ban comes 33 years after
    a federal judge blocked the agency’s initial attempt to ban the cancer-causing
    mineral. While the use of asbestos has declined since, it remains a significant
    health threat.
