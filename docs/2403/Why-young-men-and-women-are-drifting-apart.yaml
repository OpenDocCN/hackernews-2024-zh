    discussing how hard it is to meet a nice, enlightened man. Paulina Nasilowska
    got a big pay rise a few years ago. Her boyfriend asked: “Did you have an affair
    with your boss?” He is now an ex-boyfriend.'

- en: Ms Nasilowska’s friend, Joanna Walczak, recalls a man she met on Tinder who
    revealed that he was a “red-pill” guy (a reference to “The Matrix”, a film, meaning
    someone who sees reality clearly. In the “manosphere”, a global online community
    of angry men, it means realising that men are oppressed.) He thought household
    chores and child care were women’s work, and that women could not be leaders.
    They didn’t have a second date.
