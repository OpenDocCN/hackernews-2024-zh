# What if it isn't happening, AGI is not coming?

No matter what appears to be happening, we always have to consider what if it isn't. What If LLMs fail to turn into AGIs? Has our quest for intelligence simply unveiled our demonstrable lack thereof? Will trillions of dollars turn unpredictable hallucination machines into reliable universal productivity tools that can do anything?

When it comes to hard problems the herd is almost universally always wrong. There is an enormous amount of institutional money flowing into AI development on the premise that LLM architecture is going to manifest something we call AGI that will solve all the world’s problems.

So what are some of the counter perspectives?

These are the primary arguments that are expanded below:

1.  We will soon be **reaching the limits of hardware scaling** for larger AI models.

2.  There have been **no major AI technology breakthroughs in decades**. Everything we are seeing is larger compute scaling.

3.  **Scaling alone is not going to create AGI**, need other novel discoveries.

For GD, the gradients are computed by passing through the entire training set before taking a step. SGD uses one sample - drawn randomly from the training set hence the term stochastic. Batch GD uses a greater than 1 sample but not all samples to compute gradients.

A short perspective from Gary Marcus on why we haven’t seen hints of GPT5 as of yet. This aligns with the view of reaching limits on scaling.

> Here’s a theory: [Why OpenAI has not already released GPT5 to compete with Gemini and Claude]
> 
> • OpenAI tried already[creating GPT5], but what they came up with wasn’t impressive enough, so they called it GPT 4.5 Turbo.
> 
> • They are still trying, but nothing they have come up with comes close to living up to expectations.
> 
> • They aren’t really sure what to do next.
> 
> • They aren’t sure they can do a lot better without a LOT of money, maybe even $7T worth of infrastructure.
> 
> • So we will have to wait a while longer, maybe a lot longer.

This suite of tests from [Maximum Truth](https://www.maximumtruth.org/p/ais-ranked-by-iq-ai-passes-100-iq) demonstrates the trouble of measuring the “IQ” of LLM intelligence.

The new Claude-3 scores 101 the highest of any LLM so far. However, Claude is still a strange mix of capabilities in that IQ measurements give us no hint as to how Claude performs. It still fails to answer basic questions and hallucinates, but at the same time has proven to solve far more complex problems than other models.

Here is Claude-3 failing to answer correctly the relative weight of feathers and bricks: How many more billions of dollars of compute will solve this one?

And here is Claude-3 solving novel problems:

IQ tests don’t predict this type of divergence in expected capability and it is exactly this that continues to create such divergence in opinion as to whether we are getting closer to AGI or making very expensive and unreliable Dr. Jekylls and Mr. Hydes.

Billions to trillions of dollars will be poured into research over the next decade. More humans than ever are looking for breakthroughs. We have exponentially increased the parallel efforts. LLM architecture might be unable to deliver in its current state, but it has ignited monumental investments into research that might find other paths.

However, expectations have been set extremely high. AI is the perfect technology that is currently just good enough to excite the imagination of what it could do making it seemingly within grasp but potentially still far away. It is the problem of being almost there seemingly indefinitely. Despite the real utility of current LLMs, the promises are far greater and if not delivered will result in significant market collapse in due time.

Without AGI we are still exponentially improving, just not vertically with intelligence, but horizontally as new applications and methods are discovered for its use. Refinement in training, data, inferencing and application are all still advancing.

If we are not intelligent enough to know what is intelligence, then just how intelligent are we? And are we intelligent enough to build more of something that we don't know what it is?
