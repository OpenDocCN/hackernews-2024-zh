- en: In a [recent talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TURRApCLJ9U) at the launch
    of the new [Committee for Academic Freedom](https://afcomm.org.uk/), philosopher
    Kathleen Stock recalled research seminars at the universities of St Andrews and
    Leeds in the 1990s, in which faculty would continuously search for weak points
    in arguments and not hesitate to raise these during questions following the seminar,
    often in a biting fashion.

- en: Since the 2010s, as Stock noted, there has been a marked turn away from this
    gladiatorial style of debate, a move driven in part by feminist activists, who
    argued that such an atmosphere deterred women from participation. From this came
    new codes of conduct for academic events, from organisations as varied as [the
    American Society for Aesthetics](https://cdn.ymaws.com/aesthetics-online.org/resource/resmgr/files/ASA_policies_on_discriminati.pdf),
    the [King’s College London department of war studies](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/warstudies/assets/code-of-conduct-poster-final-9.8.18.pdf)
    and the [Imperial College Astrophysics Group](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/astrophysics/people/).

    hominem attacks, sustained disruption of events and anything relating to the identity
    of the participants (although, in my experience, such guidelines are followed
    very selectively). But other guidelines, relating to undefined concepts of harassment,
    power dynamics and offence, can deter robust interrogation of scholarly material.

    which featured a “magnificent contempt for stupid ideas”. More common today are
    insipid responses such as: “That’s really interesting: could you say a bit more
    about it?” I am very familiar with the latter, having seen highly contentious
    and contestable views (especially on charged issues such as the Russia-Ukraine
    war or the situation in Israel/Palestine) met mostly with sage nodding or silence,
    an artificial “respect” which really amounts to disengagement. It is hard to imagine
    even the [charged but brilliant 2010 back-and-forth between historians Richard
    J. Evans and Timothy Snyder](https://www.newstatesman.com/culture/2010/11/snyder-book-evans-review)
    occurring today, even though the exchange brought to the fore major methodological
    and historiographical questions.'

    others markedly critical, but all focused on the texts in question. My criticisms
    often relate to unsubstantiated or falsifiable assertions, logical fallacies,
    lack of awareness of relevant scholarship, or insufficient critical engagement
    with highly subjective or contested arguments, testimonies or positions. But where
    the work may be salvageable, I attempt to give details of what is required, even
    when extensive.

    taken as an indictment of the whole approach. The author of one book I reviewed
    negatively later argued that they hoped such reviews would not be published today.
    Such a possibility concerns me as I believe it could undermine fundamental aspects
    of scholarly culture.

- en: Both peer review and published review serve a vital self-regulatory role for
    scholarship. If an academic’s arguments, reasoning or use of data are open to
    challenge, so the argument goes, another scholar will provide the appropriate
    critique, nuancing, supplementing and enhancing the relevant body of discourse.
    This idealistic model is inevitably tempered by other power dynamics, particularly
    those affecting young or precariously employed academics. But it should not be
    unthinkable that senior figures could respect the right of juniors to participate
    in the process in such a manner.

    No work can be viewed as remarkable unless it can be contrasted with other work
    of lesser value. There are qualities to be discerned in vital *scholarly* writing,
    as distinct from that designed for other purposes; without any sense of these,
    or mechanisms for ensuring they are sustained, the justifications for financial
    and other support for scholarly endeavour become undermined.

- en: Stock maintains that “terrible ideas” are found most often in areas of the humanities
    with less methodological consensus than the sciences. Among those I believe to
    be especially problematic are forms of ethnography or autoethnography, where the
    distinction is blurred between journalistic description and scholarly analysis,
    and writing on various types of living artistic practitioners, where too-close
    relationships between the scholar and their subject or milieu can result in [hagiographic
    treatment](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-39233-8_6). Practitioner-scholars
    sometimes [lack a background in broader critical enquiry](https://www.timeshighereducation.com/opinion/we-need-statutory-qualification-practitioners-higher-education)
    and can interpret critical responses to their practice-research in an over-personalised
    manner.

- en: Beyond this, highly politicised disciplines have sometimes adopted methods designed
    specifically to exclude critical enquiry, such as standpoint epistemology, or
    other approaches in which “lived experience” is assigned a quasi-axiomatic role.
    This is in sharp contrast with, say, areas of Holocaust scholarship, in which
    major scholars such as Christopher Browning have examined the veracity and accuracy
    of survivor testimony.

    “social justice” are often voided of a clear definition, as sociologist Bradley
    Campbell has argued in a [recent book](https://www.routledge.com/How-to-Think-Better-About-Social-Justice-Why-Good-Sociology-Matters/Campbell/p/book/9781032582993),
    and become proxies for adherence to a particular political ideology. Such an academic
    culture, in which political allegiance matters more than intellectual rigour,
    [makes possible scholarly hoaxes, such as the Sokal and the later “grievance studies”

    stripping good scholarship of meaning. And scholarship without meaning is ultimately
    scholarship without value.
