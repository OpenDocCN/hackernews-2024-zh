    and act in their rational self-interest.
  prefs: []

    in some ways, and (c) cheaper than existing technology. The combination of (a)
    and (c) can overcome (b). The classic example given in the book is the original
    transistor radio, whose the sound quality was far worse than the incumbent, beautiful-to-look-at,
    rich-sounding, furniture-sized-and-weight RCA radios. However, the advantage of
    the transistor radio is that it is portable, a feature made possible because transistors
    use so little energy. A radio at the beach that’s staticky and a tinny is a lot
    better than not having a radio at all. So, upstarts were able to sell radios that
    were [worse in a very important way](https://longform.asmartbear.com/worse-but-unique/),
    but also cheaper and with the advantage of mobility.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'Of course, over time, the transistor radio improved its sound quality, and
    this is the other factor in Disruption Theory: The technology that starts out
    worse becomes better over time, and yet is still cheaper and retains its positive
    qualities. Then the new technology fully disrupts the incumbents, who had been
    looking on, thinking “we’re the ones who have great sound, so we’re safe. We’re
    not even really competing with those toy radios.”'

    so we will ignore it.” They’re doing just the opposite. They say “this technology
    is groundbreaking and if we don’t embrace it, we will become irrelevant” and “our
    shareholders are demanding that we invest huge percentages of our annual revenue
    to do it.”

    for chatbots where the AI is excellent, more support contacts are deferred from
    reaching a human, more languages are supported, and more kinds of questions can
    be answered, so existing chatbot customers might pay more, which grows the market.
    Furthermore, some companies who previously (rightly) saw chatbots as a terrible
    customer experience, will change their mind with sufficiently good AI, and will
    enter the chatbot market, which again grows that market.
