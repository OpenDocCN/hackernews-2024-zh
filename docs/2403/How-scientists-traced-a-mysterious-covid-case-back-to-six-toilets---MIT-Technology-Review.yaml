    enormous quantity of a very weird variant. The researchers would desperately like
    to find that person. **But what if that person doesn’t want to be found?**

- en: 'A few years ago, Marc Johnson, a virologist at the University of Missouri,
    became obsessed with weird covid variants he was seeing in wastewater samples.
    The ones that caught his eye were odd in a couple of different ways: they didn’t
    match any of the common variants, and they didn’t circulate. They would pop up
    in a single location, persist for some length of time, and then often disappear—a
    blip. Johnson found his first blip in Missouri. **“It drove me nuts,” he says.
    “I was like, ‘What the hell was going on here?’” **'

    X) for wastewater. In January 2022, he got another hit in a wastewater sample
    shipped from a Wisconsin treatment plant. He and David O’Connor, a virologist
    at the University of Wisconsin, started working with state health officials to
    track the signal—from the treatment plant to a pumping station and then to the
    outskirts of the city, “one manhole at a time,” Johnson says. “Every time there
    was a branch in the road, we would check which branch [the signal] was coming
    from.”

    might be coming from an animal. At one point O’Connor took people from his lab
    to a dog park to ask dog owners for poop samples. “There were so many red herrings,”
    Johnson says.

    the last one on the branch that had the variant. They got lucky. “The only source
    was this company,” Johnson says. [Their results](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanmic/article/PIIS2666-5247(23)00372-5/fulltext)came
    out in March in *Lancet Microbe*.

    of the pandemic, but it goes back decades.** A team of Canadian researchers outlines
    several historical examples [in this story](https://theconversation.com/targeted-wastewater-surveillance-has-a-history-of-social-and-ethical-concerns-183570).
    In [one example](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/146642405107100109),
    a public health official traced a 1946 typhoid outbreak to the wife of a man who
    sold ice cream at the beach. Even then, the researcher expressed some hesitation.
    The study didn’t name the wife or the town, and he cautioned that infections probably
    shouldn’t be traced back to an individual “except in the presence of an outbreak.”'

    scientists traced another typhoid epidemic to one woman, who was then banned from
    food service and eventually talked into having her gallbladder removed to eliminate
    the infection. Such publicity can have a “devastating effect on the carrier,”
    they remarked in their write-up of the case. “From being a quiet and respected
    citizen, she becomes a social pariah.”
