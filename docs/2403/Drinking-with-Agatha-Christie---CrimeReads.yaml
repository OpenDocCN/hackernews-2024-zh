- en: 'Tisanes, hot chocolate, a pint, gin and gingerbeer, a strong cup of tea: it’s
    simply not a Christie mystery without an array of beverages at the ready. As a
    longterm Christie devotee, during re-reads, certain aspects of her usage of beverages
    kept asserting themselves. Whether it’s head honcho Poirot or a minor character
    murdered in the second chapter, what each character chooses to drink says something
    discernible about personality, class and historical context.'

- en: Christie’s most famed detectives, Poirot and Miss Marple, certainly had their
    liquid preferences. *“Hercule Poirot sat at breakfast in his small but agreeably
    cosy flat in Whitehall Mansions. He had enjoyed his brioche and his cup of hot
    chocolate. Unusually, for he was a creature of habit and rarely varied his breakfast
    routine, he asked his valet, George, to make him a second cup of chocolate.”*
    In Hercule Poirot’s Christmas, as well as in countless other Poirot short stories
    and mysteries, his passion for sweets also translates into his drink preferences.
    He loves his hot chocolate, as well as his sweet liqueurs, such as *creme de menthe*
    and *sirop de cassis*. It’s also hard to forget Poirot’s passion for *tisanes*,
    various herbal teas. These preferences become a literary nod to his “foreign”
    character. When Poirot requests these libations, the general response of his friends
    or those around him is to be incredulous that anyone would want to imbibe such
    concoctions. Poirot’s unusual liquid preferences for the time are chalked up to
    his Belgian nationality and status as an outsider, as well as his flamboyant stylistic
    choices.

- en: On the flip side, elderly amateur detective Miss Marple is as stereotypically
    Victorian British as can be, preferring a strong cup of tea. No cocktails, liqueurs
    or ale for Miss Marple, although she does keep brandy on hand for gentlemen callers
    or in case of shock. In fact, the only occasion where Miss Marple nearly ends
    up being poisoned, in *Nemesis*, a soothing nighttime “milky drink” is offered
    to her. A nightcap or an espresso simply wouldn’t have been a logical in-character
    option for Jane Marple. Marple fans often find her character a reassuring presence,
    and her teatime scenes ooze coziness- even when in Bertram’s Hotel with its legendary
    high tea services, things aren’t as cozy as they seem.

- en: 'Christie also makes subtle social commentary about class, gender and profession
    by what many of the other characters opt for: the burly policemen and British
    detectives in Christie’s work go in for ale or beer, the Bright Young Things and
    beatniks down cocktails and Champagne, and intellectuals opt for black coffee.
    The upper-class characters who had the means to travel in luxury, such as resort
    tourists in *A Caribbean Mystery,* indulge in tropical period drinks like Planters
    Punch (a Jamaican rum cocktail from the late 1800’s). In another exotic travel
    setting, passengers riding the Orient Express in *Murder on the Orient Express*
    indulged in cocktails, likely sidecars, Sazeracs and mint juleps.'

  zh: 克里斯蒂还通过许多其他角色选择的方式进行了有关阶级、性别和职业的微妙社会评论：克里斯蒂作品中的壮硕警察和英国侦探喜欢淡啤酒或啤酒，而光鲜亮丽的年轻人和垮掉的一代则喜欢鸡尾酒和香槟，知识分子则倾向于喝黑咖啡。那些有能力奢华旅行的上流社会人物，如《加勒比海谜案》中的度假胜地游客，沉溺于像“普兰特夫人的拳”这样的热带时期饮品（一种来自19世纪末的牙买加朗姆酒鸡尾酒）。在另一个异国旅行背景下，乘坐东方快车的乘客们在《东方快车谋杀案》中沉溺于鸡尾酒，可能是边车、萨泽拉克和薄荷朱叶。
- en: Christie also famously offs a lot of her murder victims with the help of a drink,
    owing likely in part to her wartime work at a dispensary which gave her a vast
    working knowledge of various poisons. Heather Badcock meets her end after a poisoned
    daiquiri at a house party in *The Mirror Crack’d From Side To Side*. An unfortunate
    vicar departs the world following a lethal cocktail in *Three Act Tragedy,* while
    Rosemary Barton drinks a fatal Champagne laced with cyanide in, as one might guess
    from the title, *Sparkling Cyanide.* Several characters in her short stories are
    poisoned with black coffee or tea as the means to kill; with the bitter taste
    of coffee and the tannins in tea helping to mask the flavor of the danger lurking
    within.

  zh: 克里斯蒂还因用饮料杀害了许多她的谋杀受害者而闻名，这可能部分归功于她在药房工作期间对各种毒药有着广泛的工作知识。希瑟·巴德科克在《从一边到另一边的镜子崩裂》中，在一次家庭聚会上因被下毒戴基利而终结了她的生命。一个不幸的牧师在《三幕悲剧》中饮下致命的鸡尾酒后离开了这个世界，而罗斯玛丽·巴顿则在《闪亮的氰化物》中喝下了含有氰化物的致命香槟，正如从标题中可以猜测的那样。在她的短篇小说中，有几个角色是通过黑咖啡或茶来实施谋杀的手段；咖啡的苦涩味和茶叶中的单宁有助于掩盖潜藏在其中的危险味道。
- en: Not only, though, do these liquids play a part in the storyline, but again,
    the murderous beverages are an indicator of the victim’s personality and societal
    status. One might even argue that the crime could not have occurred if said victim
    was not the type of person, as it were, to have downed the drink. Heather Badcock
    was chatty and overly excited to see her heroine. A rum-based daiquiri would’ve
    been exotic and exciting for someone who likely never had a “fancy” mixed drink
    on a regular basis. Wealthy Rosemary Barton faced her doom at a fancy birthday
    dinner at an upscale restaurant – champagne was *de rigueur.* The mention of a
    murdered elderly lady by the swapping out of hat paint for syrup of figs in *Cards
    on the Table* is yet another brilliant instance. Similar to how Miss Marple would
    never have been able to be poisoned with beer or a cappuccino, an invalid yet
    relatively well-to-do elderly woman’s killer would’ve also had to resort to a
    drink that made (fatal) sense for their victim to quench. Christie, I’ll drink
    to that!

  zh: 不仅如此，这些液体在故事情节中发挥了作用，而且，这些致命的饮料又是受害者个性和社会地位的指示物。有人甚至可能会认为，如果说的受害者不是那种喜欢饮用这种饮料的人，那么这场罪行可能根本不会发生。希瑟·巴德科克健谈而且过于兴奋地见到了她的女英雄。对于一个通常不会定期喝“高级”混合饮料的人来说，基于朗姆酒的戴基利可能会显得异常和令人兴奋。富有的罗斯玛丽·巴顿在高档餐厅举办的一场豪华生日晚宴上面临了她的厄运——香槟成为了必不可少的饮品。在《桌上的牌》中，提到一个被谋杀的老太太因为用无花果糖浆替换帽油而遭遇不幸，这是另一个明智的例子。类似于马普尔小姐永远不可能被啤酒或卡布奇诺毒死一样，一个身体虚弱但相对富裕的老年女性的凶手也必须采用对其受害者来说有（致命）意义的饮料。克里斯蒂，我为此干杯！
