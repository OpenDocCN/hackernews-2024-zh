    certainly apples and oranges. All three authors are military historians, if of
    dissimilar stripes and with very varying direct, practical experience of warfare.
    (Full disclosure: born in London in 1947, your reviewer has absolutely none.)
    But only one of the trio – Matthew Sears – is a classicist proper, which matters
    greatly when the subjects in question are the fascinating but also hugely controversial
    ancient Spartans and their historiography.'

    trumpets the ‘Hybrid Athlete’ website, which advocates – vigorously and not entirely
    unhistorically – pumping iron the ancient Spartan way. Whatever one thinks of
    the latter exercise (count me out), neither of these books could remotely be considered
    boring. Happily, too, both are by no means confined to antiquity. Besides, what
    matters for each of them is not only the ‘what’ or the ‘how’ of history, but how
    what (may have) happened has been commemorated – or mythicised. For there was
    (and still is) a Spartan myth, or ‘mirage’ – but what exactly that consists of,
    and how to read it critically against other, reliable contemporary evidence as
    survives, is often beyond the capacity of the less professionally equipped.

- en: The ‘commemoration’ that Sears has mostly in mind is ancient, and largely confined
    to the Archaic and Classical periods (c.700-300 BC in round figures). His use
    or interpretation of ‘commemoration’ is, however, somewhat unsettlingly expansive.
    This is not just a study of the ancient equivalents of the Whitehall Cenotaph,
    shall we say, though there is a good deal of that, usually well done. Instead
    we are given long passages of narrative of various aspects of Spartan militarism,
    not precisely defined, and confined to military actions, by no means all of which
    can be justified as strictly necessary background for appreciating Spartan commemoration
    proper.

    against Persians and other invaders in high summer 480 BC – is accorded centre
    stage, as a major plank in Sparta’s commemoration platform. The Spartans themselves
    made a black broth of it, ideologically speaking, and other ancient Greeks followed
    their lead, negatively as well as positively. Sears, however, wants to make it
    even more than that: namely the major instance of Sparta’s ultraconservative adherence
    to glory and fame above all other considerations and, more specifically, to exclusively
    personal and collective glory in the ‘beautiful death’ – as opposed to any genuine
    concern for the interests of any other Greeks ever. The Delphic maxim ‘nothing
    to excess’ comes to mind.'

    only with ‘the’ Battle of Thermopylae but also with the many other engagements
    fought before and well after, as recently as the Second World War, in this key
    pass in north-central Greece named for its thermal springs. *The Killing Ground*
    is that book, tricked out with a veritable arsenal – indeed, battery – of supporting
    illustrations (culminating in Jacques-Louis David’s *Léonide aux Thermopyles*)
    and maps, all superb, written expressly for nonspecialist readers. The co-authors
    make no bones about it: the uber-famous August 480 BC affair – the second of their
    16 battles and 27 ‘actions’ at Thermopylae – ‘may be the most famous battle in
    human history’ or at any rate ‘one of the most famous killing grounds in history’
    – certainly one of the greatest stories ever (to be) told. The book parades an
    apparatus of scholarship in endnotes, though these are used not only to document
    views expressed in the text or to suggest further, alternative readings, but also
    to settle the odd score (experto credi).'

    armchair polemology of the best sort. But caveat emptor: space forbids my drawing
    attention to much in the way of the book’s detail – and for a good long stretch
    of its contents I wouldn’t pretend to having any expertise whatsoever, not much,
    anyhow, beyond the 12th action or seventh battle of 191 BC. However, when it comes
    to the climactic, 480 BC clash, there’s an absolutely fundamental and crucial
    historiographical issue at stake: the reliability of our nearest surviving contemporary
    written source that can be called in any way historical, the *Histories* of Herodotus.'

    and then go on to write anything about the battle in any detail? But they do adopt
    what one might call a ‘radical-sceptic’ stance, doubting some of his claims and
    crediting other alternative ancient sources. On one – to me – utterly vital point,
    the precise composition of King Leonidas’ famous ‘300’, they ignore him altogether.
    Herodotus had visited Sparta and socialised with leading Spartans. There, he had
    learned by heart the individual names of all the 300\. His work being the denial
    of official history, he was not afraid to report – contrary to ‘popular’ belief
    still current today – that two of the 300 had not died in the pass. And about
    one thing Herodotus was absolutely certain: that among Leonidas’ criteria for
    selecting them (they weren’t identical with his regular bodyguard of 20-year-olds,
    also 300 in number) was that they had to be fathers of living sons. There’s no
    mention of that in *The Killing Ground*.'

- en: From ancient history to modern myth, there’s a current fad for Spartan athleticism
    – the ‘Spartan race’ or ‘Spartan workout’ (the terrifying Leeds ‘Cage Spartan
    Training’ is one example) – which is not necessarily harmful in itself. But a
    fad for all things ancient Spartan military can be, if, for instance, one is a
    member of the ‘Molon Labe’ gun-worshipping brigade and/or prepared to storm the
    US Capitol in the guise of a Spartiate trooper. Sears mentions in his prologue
    ‘the lobbying of the National Rifle Association’ and later rightly warns against
    ‘the worrying militarism inherent in such modern monuments and many modern interpretations
    of ancient material’. Just as worrying to an ancient historian is (as Sears puts
    it) ‘the trend in recent scholarship to downplay Sparta’s uniqueness’. Sears himself
    fights valiantly, and I’d say persuasively, against any such trend. The ancient
    Spartans really were one of a kind. As was – and is – the battleground (intellectual
    as well as topographical) of Thermopylae – Cole and Livingston have so valiantly
    demonstrated.
