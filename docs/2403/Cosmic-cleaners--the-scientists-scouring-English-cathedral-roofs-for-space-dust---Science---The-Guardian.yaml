    the atmosphere – some models suggest that [15,000 tons](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012821X21000534?via%3Dihub#se0120)
    reach Earth’s atmosphere (the equivalent of about 75 blue whales). But about [5,200
    tons](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012821X21000534?via%3Dihub)
    of micrometeorites fall to Earth, based on an estimate from Antarctica. These

    50 microns to two millimetres in diameter.

    asteroids and meteorites. By looking at chemical variants known as isotopes, scientists
    can understand more about the parent body that the cosmic dust came from – and
    what happened to it as it entered Earth’s atmosphere.

    between objects in the solar system when the Earth was young. That dust is trapped

    through Earth’s history, and how it has changed.

    – it was confined to pristine places, such as the Antarctic, or in fossilised
    sediment. But in 2009, Norwegian jazz musician turned cosmic dust hunter Jon Larsen
    began combing through hundreds of kilograms of urban dust particles, searching
    for cosmic dust. In 2017, Larsen and colleagues, including Van Ginneken, published
    [a seminal paper](https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/geology/article/45/2/119/195213/an-urban-collection-of-modern-day-large)
    in the journal *Geology*, showing that anybody with a microscope and patience
    could discover cosmic spheres.

    they continuously fall on the Earth’s surface. The particles are easily contaminated,
    which could compromise their use in research. (But that is not why Van Ginneken
    and Wozniakiewicz look like white-clad aliens – they are protecting themselves
    from bird flu, possibly contained in the droppings and bird bones we see on the

    they are large, inaccessible and largely untouched. We enter through a usually
    barred wooden door, at the back of the cathedral’s main Trinity Chapel, up hundreds
    of tightly winding steps, and then through another specially unlocked door to
    reach one of the cathedral’s roofs. This was Van Ginneken and Wozniakiewicz’s
    final roof of the day – they had trekked up to several other roofs on the cathedral.
    They have also collected dust from Rochester Cathedral, and hope to add Salisbury
    and Winchester to their list.

- en: Van Ginneken is keen to sample many roofs, to understand the biases that creep
    into urban micrometeorite collections, such as the effect of rainwater. The advantage
    of roofs is that they are easily accessible, he says. Going to Antarctica, where
    a lot of micrometeorite research has been undertaken, “is very expensive, it takes
    a lot of preparation, and there’s a limit on the amount of samples you can bring
    back”. Also, the research is limited to a specific climate and latitude. Roofs
    broaden the opportunities to investigate how these tiny dust particles interact
    in different environments.

    and they tell you a lot about that one object. Micrometeorites tell you about
    thousands, millions of objects… They tell you more about the population of asteroids
    as a whole, a snapshot of all the different processes, all the different bodies
    that are out there. And then you can compare those samples, along with meteorites,
    to the samples that are being brought back from these missions.”
