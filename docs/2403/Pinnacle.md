# Pinnacle

 *Mac Gatekeeper may initially block Pinnacle from running as it's not from the App Store.*  *If you experience this, right-click (or CTRL+click) on the .app file, select Open, you get the contextual menu to open up the app anyway. It should open normally after this.

Pinnacle is a fun side project I provide free of charge. For this reason I don't pay Microsoft and Apple hundreds of dollars in yearly fees to join their developer programs. Unfortunately, this means end users can't install free software without being nagged.*
