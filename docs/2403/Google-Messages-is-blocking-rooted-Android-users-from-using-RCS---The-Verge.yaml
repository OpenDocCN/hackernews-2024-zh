- en: Google is cracking down on rooted Android devices, blocking multiple people
    from using the RCS message feature in Google Messages. Users with rooted phones
    — a process that unlocks privileged access to the Android operating system, like
    jailbreaking iPhones — have made several reports on the [Google Messages support
    page](https://support.google.com/messages/thread/261416210), [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/androidroot/comments/1b36hij/psa_google_is_quietly_blocking_rcs_on_rooted/),
    and[*XDA*’s web forum](https://xdaforums.com/t/rcs-chat-gone-in-latest-update.4653947/)
    over the last few [months](https://www.reddit.com/r/GoogleMessages/comments/1agsjh0/rcs_issues_on_devices_that_have_unlocked/),
    finding they’re suddenly unable to send or receive RCS messages.

    shows that RCS messages would simply vanish after hitting the send button. Several
    reports also mention that Google Messages gave no indication that RCS chat was
    no longer working, and was still showing as connected and working in Google Messages.

    devices from using RCS, Google communications manager Ivy Hunt said the company
    is “ensuring that message-issuing/receiving devices are following the operating
    measures defined by the RCS standard” in a bid to prevent spam and abuse on Google
    Messages. In other words, yes, Google is blocking RCS on rooted devices.

    sufficiently — and devices that may not have access to one communication protocol
    will always have at least one other available,” said Hunt. “In this case, users
    that are not able to use RCS still have access to SMS & MMS messaging.”

    stop working if they detect that users have rooted their device as a security
    measure, but these will typically provide a [warning message](/2012/3/5/2846793/google-wallet-rooted-security-warning)
    to explain the device is unsupported. For users who experienced RCS issues with
    Google Messages, no such warning is apparently provided.
