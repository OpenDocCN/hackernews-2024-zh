    ramen shop](/24031687/nvidia-ai-npcs-convai-ces-2023), I’ve been wondering: Which
    game developer will take a flying leap on this controversial and intriguing tech?
    If you said “Ubisoft,” the company that’s always raising its hand to play [with
    VR](/2024/2/8/24066424/ubisoft-wont-increase-vr-investment-after-assassins-creed-disappointment),
    [NFTs](/2022/4/6/23013346/ubisoft-ghost-recon-breakpoint-content-nft-digits-quartz),
    [interactive TV shows](/2013/6/10/4416316/ubisoft-rabbids-invasion-interactive-tv-show-xbox-one),
    [secondary screens](/2012/6/5/3066384/zombiu-wii-u-preview) and more, you’d be
    half right.'

    featuring the company’s just-announced [“Neo NPCs”](https://news.ubisoft.com/en-us/article/5qXdxhshJBXoanFZApdG3L/how-ubisofts-new-generative-ai-prototype-changes-the-narrative-for-npcs)
    — one of whom tried to convince me to join the resistance against powerful megacorps
    by playing on my emotions. Another walked me through an infiltration plan on a
    whiteboard, letting me “convince” her that we should knock out the lights or hack
    the cameras in a facility instead of resorting to brute force.

    experiment,” a test, an R&D project in collaboration with Nvidia and [Inworld.ai](https://inworld.ai/)
    — and it’s not committing to ship them in a full game yet. That’s probably for
    the best, because while the company is trying to suggest it’s made small breakthroughs
    in “real-time emotion and animation,” “contextual awareness,” and “collaborative
    decision-making,” the demo really didn’t take me much further than Nvidia’s somewhat
    awkward cyberpunk ramen shop did.

    designer scripting their backstory, but delivery was still awkward, a little stunted,
    with lag before replies and occasional vocal stutters.

    me an actual reason to talk to these chatbots, with in-game objectives like “Learn
    more about the megacorps” and “Find out more about Bloom’s past.” I didn’t need
    to come up with improv prompts all on my own.

    was far rougher than Ubisoft’s demo in terms of tying gameplay to chat, and I
