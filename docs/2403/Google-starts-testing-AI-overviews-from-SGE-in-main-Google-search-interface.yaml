    you have not opted into the [Google Search Generative Experience](https://searchengineland.com/new-google-search-generative-ai-experience-413533)
    labs feature. Google said this is an experience on a “subset of queries, on a
    small percentage of search traffic in the U.S.,” a Google spokesperson told Search
    Engine Land.

    for searchers to opt in to see and use the Google SGE results, that contained
    AI overviews. Now some users in the U.S. may see these AI answers without specifically
    opting in to see them.

    can be especially helpful.

    to get information from a range of web pages – like “how do I get marks off painted
    walls.”

    these queries bring to users. In general, Google told us it would show AI overviews
    when it’s truly additive and in the instances when people would get a better response
    than what they’d see on Search today.

- en: '**Why we care.** These AI answers may push down both the organic and standard
    search ads. It may result in less, or potentially more, traffic to your site,
    depending on where the citations are referenced from and where Google places the
    ads. The likelihood is, these experiences will likely drive less overall traffic
    to sites than what the current Google Search results do.'

    need to be in the SGE labs to see AI overviews, Google is testing it in the wild.
