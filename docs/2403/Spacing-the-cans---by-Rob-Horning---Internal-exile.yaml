    Aldi? It’s not competing with other brands of canned tomatoes, because Aldi pretty
    much sells only its own house brands. Despite this, Aldi doesn’t simply take a
    no-frills approach and uniformly brand all its products with “Aldi”; it invents
    sub-brands like Happy Harvest to internally differentiate them. It’s as if Aldi
    wants to protect the food it sells from certain aspects of its own reputation,
    while also securing the purity of what its own brand signifies. “Aldi” can more
    concentratedly signify bare-bones economizing if it is not also burdened with
    signifying passibly edible tomatoes.

    direct competition in the retail space, they have a curious status. They are in
    part perfunctory — much like the brands of semi-bootleg video-game emulators discussed
    in [this post from the trend forecasters Nemesis](https://nemesisglobal.substack.com/p/brand-analysis-a-is-for-anbernic).
    They seem somewhat provisional, desultory, like first drafts from a brand-strategist
    firm, or improvisational parodies, or something that generative AI would spit
    out. Casa Mamita (Mexican products), Savoritz (crackers), Dakota’s Pride (canned
    beans), Southern Grove (dried fruit), Fit & Active (snack bars): these don’t quite
    cut it as viable brand names but they are not aspiring to be empty signifiers,
    like “Anbernic,” the electronics brand Nemesis discusses, or whatever this is
    that’s embossed on my tablet case:'

    the company declares that “Aldi exclusive brands allow us to provide the same
    high-quality product without passing on all of the hidden costs associated with
    the national brands, such as marketing and advertising.” This means that “Happy
    Harvest” is supposed to convey that absence of marketing and advertising cost.
    But rather than make a stab at full negation — typified by *[Repo Man–](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CN8Y0hN8ebk)*[style](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9k09WPpNeo)generic
    labels — Aldi tries to signify that absence with a lackluster presence, with mock
    marketing that conveys minimal effort. (This is why generative models would seem
    to be perfect for this kind of branding: What could better convey indifference
    and lack of care than using AI?)'

    does not define quality.” Yet this is accomplished through an adroit feat of strategic
    branding, coming up with names that fail in a precisely self-negating way. They
    are generic *through* branding rather than against it.

    to the heart of the matter. What is the true function of a brand? The simple answer
    is the brand is e*verything* (as it’s the only distinguishing factor and potential
    source of larger margins) *or* the brand is *almost nothing*, i.e. a minimum viable
    coordination point that aggregates (ideally positive) impressions of a product
    and makes it discoverable.

    brands are everything precisely when they are nothing — that they are most desirable
    as ax expression of pure nominalism. (Or you could argue that the “everything”
    brand evokes at the same time the “nothing” brand as its shadow.) Such a view
    points towards a kind of horseshoe theory of brands: As brands become more valuable
    in and of themselves, distinct from the material products they are branded onto,
    they also approach a cipher-like nullity in which they can’t signify anything
    but themselves. The stronger the brand in itself, the less it indicates about
    the products subsumed under it. At a certain extreme of self-referentiality, the
    self disappears. The brand becomes a pure vacuum, a representation that doesn’t
    represent.'

    function: Brand equity can be purposefully negative under certain conditions when
    the relation between brands controlled by a single entity creates more value than
    any brand grasped in isolation. Anbernic, by contrast, is a brand without brand
    identity (“100% lore-free” as Nemesis puts it), evoking the possibility of differentiation
    without distinction. I wonder if that is how the various structuralist and poststructuralist
    decenterings of the subject and critiques of individualism end up being recuperated:
    with nonidentity, difference in itself, being conceptualized as a branding event.'

    *[New York Times Magazine](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/21/magazine/aesthetics-tiktok-teens.html)*
    [piece](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/21/magazine/aesthetics-tiktok-teens.html)
    about the “fading” teen subcultures and ephemeral online aesthetics (“-core” etc.).
    It fits the genre of critique that posits sociality offline as more intrinsically
    real than sociality online, which helps prop up that people should organize their
    thinking about the world around a rigid distinction between the two. In other
    words, it is the sort of article that *[Real Life](https://reallifemag.com/),*
    the publication I used to work on, was launched to challenge. Silcoff even mentions
    “real life” in her definition of aesthetics:'

    to any “real life” anything, like behaviors or gathering places.

    a fleeting personal pleasure to be had mainly alone.” It’s just like New Order

    even notice that you are alone.”'

    in and of itself. Each emergent label, however, does not.”'

    it is attached to consumerist identities, like an exploded version of the chain
    stores vs. mom-and-pop stores opposition from the *No Logo* era. There is a genuine,
    authentic way to make a spectacle of the self, but it needs to tap into a rooted
    habitus and recondite practice (a “context”), and not simply reflect haphazard
    free play with readily available cultural signifiers (mere “content”). That is,
    the correct and real self is rooted in distinction (in Bordieu’s sense) and not
    differentiation. The internet is supposedly undermining the kind of distinction
    that should matter and proliferating the kinds of differences that are superficial
    rather than culturally binding. It’s no accident that Silcoff’s article revolves
    around what can be considered “preppy,” the classic snob aesthetic of the 1980s
    that played on the fault line between exclusion and commercial exploitation.

    even the vapid ones, used to tie their participants to people and places. Getting
    into a scene could be work; it required figuring out whom to talk to, or where
    to go, and maybe hanging awkwardly around a record store or nightclub or street
    corner until you got scooped up by whatever was happening. But at its deepest,
    a subculture could allow a given club kid, headbanger or punk to live in a communal
    container from the moment she woke up to the moment she went to bed.

    space in the neighbourhood and institutions, real time for leisure and recreation,
    actual room on the street or street-corner. They serve to mark out and appropriate
    ‘territory’ in the localities. They focus around key occasions of social interaction:

    kids in this way; instead “real-world cultural community that has been replaced
    by an algorithmic fluidity in which nothing hangs around long enough to grow roots.”
    Rob Arcand voices a similar idea in [this critique of “-core”:](https://www.ninaprotocol.com/articles/on-the-tyranny-of-core)
    “At stake in these questions is the future of culture and its alternatives, which
    long ago traded its basis in in-person collectivity for social media as its primary
    organizational logic.” He concludes that “naming trends and producing short-lived
    commentary,” when “prioritized over in-person participation in cultural scenes
    of many sorts,” yields a “fundamental emptiness.” Dee argues that this sort of
    rhetorical maneuver corresponds with a refusal to recognize “fandoms” as a legitimate
    form of subcultural organization.

    to remain unclear. Does the frenzy for naming and “curating” on online platforms
    make in-person meet-ups seem less desirable? Do kids turn to posting and online
    sociality because of restrictive parenting and the failure of society to provide
    them with other territories where they can experiment with identity and community?
    Are algorithms  making kids too addicted to phones to be present in reciprocal
    friendships? Does the phone as an interface habituate kids to solitary solipsism?
    Are online spaces inadequate for identity formation because the stakes there are
    too high, too low, or both simultaneously? Can you have any subcultures without
    a mainstream for them to define themselves against? Is the mainstream, if it still
    could be said to exist, more or less hegemonic?

    analysis, pursuing an illegibility in the available conditions, part of which
    is a profusion of aesthetics with no enduring social foundations. The subcultures
    are counter-hegemonic by being inscrutable, by being all aesthetics instead of
    a single one subject to immediate appropriation.

    necessarily occurs offline. You can’t post punk.
