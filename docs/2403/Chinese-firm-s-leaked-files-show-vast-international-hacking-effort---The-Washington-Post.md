# Chinese firm’s leaked files show vast international hacking effort - The Washington Post

correction

A previous version of this article incorrectly asserted that, in leaked documents, the Chinese hacking group iSoon claimed to be able to exploit vulnerabilities in U.S. companies, including Microsoft, Apple and Google. In fact, the hackers claimed that they were able to target users of these platforms to install malicious software and extract data. The article has been corrected.

A trove of leaked documents from a Chinese state-linked hacking group shows that Beijing’s intelligence and military groups are attempting large-scale, systematic cyber intrusions against foreign governments, companies and infrastructure — with hackers of one company claiming to be able to target users of Microsoft, Apple and Google.

The cache — containing more than 570 files, images and chat logs — offers an unprecedented look inside the operations of one of the firms that Chinese government agencies hire for on-demand, mass data**-**collecting operations.
