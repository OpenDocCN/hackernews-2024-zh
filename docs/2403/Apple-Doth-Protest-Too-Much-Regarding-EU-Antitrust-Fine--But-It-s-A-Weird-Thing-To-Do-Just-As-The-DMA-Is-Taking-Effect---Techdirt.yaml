    feel like bureaucrats doing a “general punishment” for disliking a successful
    company, rather than an actual response to abusive, anti-competitive behavior
    by a large company. However, that does not mean that there is no place for antitrust
    enforcement. It’s just that it should be in response to actual evidence of companies
    abusing their market position to make anti-competitive moves in an unfair manner.

    telling users that they can subscribe directly for less by going to Spotify’s
    website, seems like… exactly that. This week, the [EU fined Apple around $2 billion](https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_24_1161)
    in response to exactly that complaint from Spotify. And this seems like the proper
    use of antitrust law.

    dominant position on the market for the distribution of music streaming apps to
    iPhone and iPad users (‘iOS users’) through its App Store. In particular, the
    Commission found that Apple applied restrictions on app developers preventing
    them from informing iOS users about alternative and cheaper music subscription
    services available outside of the app (‘anti-steering provisions’). This is illegal
    under EU antitrust rules.*'

    stranglehold on getting any apps onto iOS devices through its App Store. This
    is somewhat amusing, given that the iPhone launched without an app store, and
    Steve Jobs told everyone to just write web apps for it — how things changed! If
    someone wants to offer paid apps through the app store, then they have to use
    Apple’s payment systems, from which Apple takes a hefty, hefty cut (basically
    30%).

    Oddly, [Epic won against Google](https://www.techdirt.com/2023/12/13/things-that-make-no-sense-epic-lost-its-fight-over-apples-closed-ios-platform-but-won-it-over-googles-more-open-android-platform/)
    and mostly [lost against Apple](https://www.techdirt.com/2023/04/25/once-again-epic-fails-in-its-antitrust-quest-against-apple/),
    even though Google’s platform is much more open and it’s much easier to avoid
    the 30% tax on in-app payments. But, the one area where Epic did prevail over
    Apple was on the “anti-steering” provisions, in which Apple blocked Epic from
    telling users to complete their transactions off of the iOS platform in order
    to avoid the 30% Apple fee.

- en: The Spotify case in the EU is similar to that. It’s a decision over Apple’s
    anti-steering efforts that limits the ability of Spotify to tell people how much
    it costs to sign up for Spotify’s paid plans (Spotify also offers free plans).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And, it does seem like extremely problematic behavior for Apple to block app
    developers from telling users to pay on the web, or to explain why they’d prefer
    users do so. If Apple’s payment system is so much more convenient and better,
    then just rely on competing on being better, rather than trying to silence app
    developers.

    which really comes off poorly. It goes on and on about how it provides all sorts
    of wonderful free services to Spotify, which it never pays for, as if this is
    all somehow unfair.

    Spotify are part of what make the iPhone much more valuable. So, contrary to Apple’s
    claims, it does make money from Spotify (and all the other apps in the app store)
    because without them, there is much less reason to pay a ton of money for an iPhone
    and an iPad. And the vast majority of Apple’s revenue comes from hardware sales
    of those two devices. In 2023, it looks like about $230 billion dollars from iPhone
    and iPad sales alone (and if you add in Apple Watches and other accessories like
    AirPods, it’s up closer to $300 billion).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The fact that a service like Spotify is available helps make all of those things
    more valuable, leading more people to be willing to buy. Apple is being disingenuous
    in suggesting that companies are somehow taking advantage of Apple by not agreeing
    to pay them extra money for in-app transactions.

    business are generally pretty terrible. This is because copyright holders [always
    want to squeeze way more money](https://www.techdirt.com/2018/03/12/killing-golden-goose-again-how-copyright-stranglehold-dooms-spotify/)
    out of anyone who wants to do anything useful with music, often killing the golden
    goose that is generating revenue by squeezing until they die. Adding another 30%
    cut on top of that would effectively kill any opportunity at profitability.'

    a 1-to-1 replacement for Spotify. But, in Apple’s case, it doesn’t have to pay
    that same 30% fee, since it’s the same company.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And it’s *that factor* that makes this anti-competitive. It’s using its own
    market leverage over the app market to force a competing service to pay a much
    higher fee than it has to pay itself. That seems like a classic situation for
    antitrust.

    Music has an inherent, built-in advantage of not having to worry about the 30%
    cut that might take a music service from barely profitable to deeply unprofitable.

    with Spotify. I also have no problem with Apple charging whatever it wants for
    its own payment system. But I do have a problem with Apple then saying that Spotify
    can’t talk about the basics of its subscription plans. That seems unnecessarily
    stifling.

    of it was that it was supposed to help solve anticompetitive activity [by the
    large “gatekeepers.”](https://www.techdirt.com/2023/09/07/the-eu-designates-the-six-companies-you-already-expected-as-gatekeepers-under-the-digital-markets-act/)

    as of (checks calendar)… oh shit… today?

    two days before Apple will be required to comply with the DMA’s rules for gatekeepers,
    if the DMA is designed to solve these problems and prevent anticompetitive activity
    by gatekeepers, which, we’ve repeatedly been told, will solve competition problems
    regarding the large digital gatekeepers in the EU. If that isn’t the case, what
    are we even doing with the DMA?

    better if they stopped it. Apple’s protests are surprisingly whiny and ignore
    the reality of the situation. But, it’s also bizarre for the EU to do this now
    just as the DMA (which is supposed to solve all this) comes into effect.
