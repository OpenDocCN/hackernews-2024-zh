- en: A day after researchers surfaced [X’s plans to test NSFW adult communities](https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/28/x-is-testing-nsfw-adult-communities-according-to-screenshots/)
    on the platform formerly known as Twitter, the company confirmed that Community
    admins can now set an “Adult Content” label in their settings to avoid having
    their communities’ content auto-filtered. Otherwise, all NSFW content will be
    soon filtered across X’s Communities by default. Communities are X’s smaller groups
    with their own feeds outside of the main timeline.

    by various researchers and reverse engineers, and point to a social network that
    will now more directly embrace the adult content that has always been present
    on the platform.

    advertising venue for sex workers as well as home to a large amount of adult content-focused
    bots and spam. According to [internal documents obtained by Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/technology/exclusive-where-did-tweeters-go-twitter-is-losing-its-most-active-users-internal-2022-10-25/)
    in 2022, roughly 13% of all Twitter posts included NSFW content, like nude and
    explicit photos, videos and other pornography. What’s more, the documents indicated
    that adult content was one of the fastest-growing genres on the platform, even
    as news and sports were declining.

    on the service now known as X, which promoted NSFW content with links in their
    profiles, or bios, leading them to regularly reply to posts with messages like
    “nudes in bio,” “pics in bio” and other more explicit terms.

    the confirmation that NSFW-focused communities will be allowed to designate themselves
    as such to keep from having their content filtered automatically, as in other
    Communities.

    product was growing fast](https://www.theverge.com/23940924/elon-musk-x-twitter-all-hands-linda-yaccarino-super-app)
    but “there’s a lot of work to do to make Communities compelling.” He also shared
    that X was seeing “rapid percentage growth” in Communities, and had been adding
    new features, like the ability to include any X account’s feed in the Community
    feed. For example, a video game-focused community may want to include the X accounts
    of notable video game reviewers or commentators, he said. The X executives had
    not shared any plans for NSFW Communities at that time.

    serve as a competitor to larger forum sites like Reddit and host training data

    adult content, X will also introduce a Ban button alongside Keep and Hide buttons
    on the Reported posts page along with more detailed messages explaining why you’re
    not eligible to join a given Community, plus temporary and permanent bans for
    spammers; tools to sort posts by Trending, Most recent and Most liked; a Media
    tab for Communities on Android; and more, including a range of bug fixes and minor
    improvements.

    users will soon be able to explore top posts and top communities across all Communities
    and tools to discover top communities and posts by topic. Communities will also
    be promoted and recommended to potentially interested users on the For You tab,
    allowing them to grow more of a following. Mods will have access to Community
    Analytics and will be able to pin multiple members’ posts. There will also be
    support for spam filter levels set by admins, simplified reporting and moderation
    pages, and audio Spaces in Communities, among other things.
