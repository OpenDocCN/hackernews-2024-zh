- en: An In-App Browser can open when users tap on links in a non-browser app. Rather
    than switching out of the app and to the user's default browser, in-app browsers
    open a pane within the host native app to render web pages. Hence the name, “in-app
    browser”.

- en: When you click on a link to a third-party website, many popular apps ignore
    your choice of default browser and instead automatically and silently replace
    your default browser with their own in-app browser. Many users - likely most users!
    - are not aware that this switch has taken place.
  id: totrans-split-11

- en: Worst of all, this switch grants these apps the ability to spy and manipulate
    third-party websites. Popular apps like Instagram, Facebook Messenger and Facebook
    [have all been caught injecting JavaScript](https://krausefx.com/blog/ios-privacy-instagram-and-facebook-can-track-anything-you-do-on-any-website-in-their-in-app-browser)
    via their in-app browsers into third party websites. TikTok was running [commands
    that were essentially a keylogger](https://krausefx.com/blog/announcing-inappbrowsercom-see-what-javascript-commands-get-executed-in-an-in-app-browser).
    While we have no proof that this data was used or exfiltrated from the device,
    the mere presence of JavaScript code collecting this data combined with no plausible
    explanation is extremely concerning.

    iOS and Android provide a system components (SFSafariViewController and Android
    Custom Tabs respectively), which do not allow the hosting app to inject JavaScript
    or otherwise spy on the user. Android Custom Tabs solution also (by default) invokes
    the users default browser.

    this way. Mandating that apps respect browser choice isn't just a matter of convenience;
    it's about empowering both consumers and companies to thrive in a more open, stable,
    feature rich, secure and private digital ecosystem.

- en: Disrespect of users' choice of browser also stifles innovation. The Web thrives
    when browsers compete on functionality and user experience. In-app browsers, however,
    don't compete as browsers. Many, perhaps even most, users are unaware they are
    being foisted upon them. They're also unaware of the quality, security and privacy
    risks associated with them. In-app browsers operate in a vacuum, immune from competitive
    pressure to improve.

- en: Remote tab in-app browsers such as Android Custom Tabs are a potentially ideal
    solution for most users. Android Custom Tabs, by default, invokes the user's default
    browser and prevents the app injecting JavaScript. This is an interesting middle
    ground where the user (and the app) can benefit from not leaving the app context
    while still respecting the user's choice of default browser and preserving the
    user's privacy. However, it is currently possible for the hosting native app to
    lock Android Custom Tabs to a particular browser and override the user's choice
    of default browser. This ability needs to be removed.

    these remedies will prevent gatekeepers from subverting the user choice of browser,
    provide users enhanced control over their privacy and security, and make technical
    fixes to the underpinnings of how web pages are loaded. These fixes will project
    a user's choice of browser in non-browser apps they use, providing users the security,
    privacy, stability and features on which browser wars are legitimately fought.
    No longer will apps be allowed to syphon web traffic for their own enrichment
    at the detriment of the community at large.
