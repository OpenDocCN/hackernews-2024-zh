- en: In 2016, Alex de Vries read somewhere that a single bitcoin transaction consumes
    as much energy as the average American household uses in a day. At the time, de
    Vries, who is Dutch, was working at a consulting firm. In his spare time, he wrote
    a blog, called Digiconomist, about the risks of investing in cryptocurrency. He
    found the energy-use figure disturbing.

    it?” he told me recently over Zoom. “I tried to look up some data, but I couldn’t
    really find anything.” De Vries, then twenty-seven, decided that he would have
    to come up with the information himself. He put together what he called the Bitcoin
    Energy Consumption Index, and posted it on [Digiconomist](https://digiconomist.net/).
    According to the index’s latest figures, bitcoin mining now consumes a hundred
    and forty-five billion kilowatt-hours of electricity per year, which is more than
    is used by the entire nation of the Netherlands, and producing that electricity
    results in eighty-one million tons of CO[2], which is more than the annual emissions
    of a nation like Morocco. De Vries subsequently began to track the electronic
    waste produced by bitcoin mining—an iPhone’s worth for every transaction—and its
    water use—which is something like two trillion litres per year. (The water goes
    toward cooling the servers used in mining, and the e-waste is produced by servers
    that have become out of date.)

    that it has a similar capability, and also the potential to have a similar growth
    trajectory in the coming years, and I felt immediately prompted to make sure people
    are aware that this is also energy-intensive technology,” he explained. He added
    a new tab to his blog: “AI sustainability.” In a paper he published last fall,
    in *Joule*, a journal devoted to sustainable energy, de Vries, who now works for
    the Netherlands’ central bank, estimated that if Google were to integrate generative
    A.I. into every search, its electricity use would rise to something like twenty-nine
    billion kilowatt-hours per year. This is more than is consumed by many countries,
    including Kenya, Guatemala, and Croatia.'

    de Vries said. Recently, the world’s most prominent A.I. cheerleader, Sam Altman,
    the C.E.O. of OpenAI, voiced similar concerns, albeit with a different spin. “I
    think we still don’t appreciate the energy needs of this technology,” Altman said
    at a public appearance in Davos. He didn’t see how these needs could be met, he
    went on, “without a breakthrough.” He added, “We need fusion or we need, like,
    radically cheaper solar plus storage, or something, at massive scale—like, a scale
    that no one is really planning for.”

- en: 'Last week, the International Energy Agency announced that energy-related global
    CO[2] emissions rose, yet again, in 2023, to more than thirty-seven billion metric
    tons. The increase comes at a time when the whole world is supposedly striving
    to reach net-zero emissions, and it indicates that global efforts are, to put
    it mildly, falling short. Much of the increase in emissions came from China, and
    most of it was driven by century-old technologies, such as the internal-combustion
    engine. So data centers are, for now at least, a small part of the problem. Still,
    as the use of A.I. ramps up and bitcoin prices reach new heights, the question
    is: How can the world reach net zero if it keeps inventing new ways to consume
    energy? (In the U.S., data centers now account for about four per cent of electricity
    consumption, and that figure is expected to climb to six per cent by 2026.)'

- en: Mining cryptocurrencies like bitcoin eats up electricity owing to the way the
    system was set up. To acquire bitcoin (and other currencies that rely on a similar
    scheme), miners compete to answer cryptographic riddles. Winning the competition
    takes a lot of computing power. As a result, server farms devoted to crypto mining
    tend to be situated in parts of the world where electricity is cheap. China used
    to lead the world in crypto mining, but it imposed a ban on the practice in 2021,
    and now the U.S. is No. 1\. A few months ago, the U.S. Department of Energy tried
    to compel mining concerns to report their energy use, but in February a Texas
    judge issued a temporary restraining order blocking the effort. (According to
    the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, crypto mining in the
    U.S. uses almost as much energy as all the nation’s home computers combined.)
    Meanwhile, the higher the price of bitcoin rises—it reached a record of sixty-nine
    thousand dollars on March 5th—the bigger the financial incentives for mining it,
    and the more energy consumed.

    kind of machine learning that produced ChatGPT relies on models that process fantastic
    amounts of information, and every bit of processing takes energy. When ChatGPT
    spits out information (or writes someone’s high-school essay), that, too, requires
    a lot of processing. It’s been estimated that ChatGPT is responding to something
    like two hundred million requests per day, and, in so doing, is consuming more
    than half a million kilowatt-hours of electricity. (For comparison’s sake, the
    average U.S. household consumes twenty-nine kilowatt-hours a day.)

- en: A.I. could potentially be used to alleviate some of the problems it is exacerbating.
    For instance, it might be used to improve the efficiency of renewable-energy systems,
    which could reduce emissions from server farms. But it seems unlikely that such
    gains will keep up with A.I.’s growing electricity demands; this, presumably,
    is why Altman argues that a technological breakthrough is needed.

- en: De Vries, for his part, is dismayed by what he sees as a lack of human learning
    in the face of so much machine learning. “I think the only thing that’s realistic
    in terms of policy, at least in the short to medium term, is disclosure requirements,”
    he said. “It’s taken a very long time before we got there with regard to cryptocurrencies,
    and I’m disappointed that we haven’t gotten there sooner with A.I. It’s like we
    saw what cryptocurrency mining could do, and we totally forgot about it.” ♦
