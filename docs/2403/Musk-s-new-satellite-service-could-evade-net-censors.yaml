    without long delays from there. Satellites in geostationary orbit, around 35,786
    kilometers from Earth, have a longer latency period. That means that the receiving
    devices on Earth would have to wait longer for a signal to arrive. An operator
    seeking to offer services such as video telephony via satellite internet will
    thus ideally do so from as close as possible.

    months. SpaceX intends to send 7,500 more satellites into space, a plan that the

    about as much as small cars, and unlike their predecessors, carry technology that
    will allow them to provide smartphones on Earth with 4G mobile communications.
