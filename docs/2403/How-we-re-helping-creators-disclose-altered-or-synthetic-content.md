# How we're helping creators disclose altered or synthetic content

> 来源：[https://blog.google/intl/en-in/products/platforms/how-were-helping-creators-disclose-altered-or-synthetic-content/](https://blog.google/intl/en-in/products/platforms/how-were-helping-creators-disclose-altered-or-synthetic-content/)

You’ll start to see the labels roll out across all YouTube surfaces and formats in the weeks ahead, beginning with the YouTube app on your phone, and soon on your desktop and TV. And while we want to give our community time to adjust to the new process and features, in the future we’ll look at enforcement measures for creators who consistently choose not to disclose this information. In some cases, YouTube may add a label even when a creator hasn't disclosed it, especially if the altered or synthetic content has the potential to confuse or mislead people.

Importantly, we continue to collaborate across the industry to help increase transparency around digital content. This includes our work as a [steering member](https://c2pa.org/post/google_pr/) of the Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity (C2PA).

In parallel, as we previously announced, we’re continuing to work towards an updated privacy process for people to request the removal of AI-generated or other synthetic or altered content that simulates an identifiable individual, including their face or voice. We’ll have more to share soon on how we’ll be introducing the process globally.
