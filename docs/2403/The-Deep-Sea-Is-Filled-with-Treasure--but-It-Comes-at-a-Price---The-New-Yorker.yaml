    a building that looks a bit like a prison and a bit like a Holiday Inn. The I.S.A.,
    which has been described as “chronically overlooked” and is so obscure that even
    many Jamaicans don’t know it exists, has jurisdiction over roughly half the globe.

    of their shores. Beyond that, the oceans and all they contain are considered “the
    common heritage of mankind.” This realm, which encompasses nearly a hundred million
    square miles of seafloor, is referred to in I.S.A.-speak simply as the Area.

- en: Scattered across the Area are great riches. Mostly, these take the shape of
    lumps that resemble blackened potatoes. The lumps, known formally as polymetallic
    nodules, consist of layers of ore that have built up around bits of marine debris,
    such as ancient shark teeth. The process by which the metals accumulate is not
    entirely understood; however, it’s thought to be exceedingly slow. A single spud-size
    nugget might take some three million years to form. It has been estimated that,
    collectively, the nodules on the bottom of the ocean contain six times as much
    cobalt, three times as much nickel, and four times as much of the rare-earth metal
    yttrium as there is on land. They contain six thousand times as much tellurium,
    a metal that’s even rarer than the rare earths.

- en: The first attempts to harvest this submerged wealth were undertaken nearly fifty
    years ago. In the summer of 1974, a drillship purportedly belonging to Howard
    Hughes—the Hughes Glomar Explorer—anchored north of Midway Atoll, ostensibly to
    bring up nodules from the depths. In fact, the ship was operated by the C.I.A.,
    which was trying to raise a sunken Soviet submarine. But then, in a curious twist,
    a real company called Ocean Minerals leased the Glomar to collect nodules from
    the seabed west of Baja California. The president of the company likened the exercise
    to “standing on the top of the Empire State Building, trying to pick up small
    stones on the sidewalk using a long straw, at night.”

    again. As one recent report put it, “The Pacific Ocean is the scene of a new wild
    west.” Thirty companies have received permits from the I.S.A. to explore the Area.
    Most are looking to slurp up the nodules; others are hoping to excavate stretches
    of the ocean floor that are rich in cobalt and copper. Permits to begin commercial
    mining could be issued within a few years.

    wind turbines, electric vehicles, solar panels, and batteries for energy storage
    requires resources, often scarce ones. (Tellurium is a key component in thin-film
    solar panels.) “The reality is that the clean-energy transition is not possible
    without taking billions of tons of metal from the planet,” Gerard Barron, the
    chairman of the Metals Company, one of the businesses that holds permits from
    the I.S.A., observed a few months ago. Seafloor nodules, he said, “offer a way
    to dramatically reduce” the environmental impact of extracting these tons.

    一家名为金属公司的企业主席Gerard Barron 几个月前曾观察到。他说，海底结核体“提供了显著减少”从中提取这些金属对环境影响的方法。
- en: But seabed mining poses environmental hazards of its own. The more scientists
    learn about the depths, the more extraordinary the discoveries. The ocean floor
    is populated by creatures that thrive under conditions that seem impossibly extreme.
    There is, for example, a ghostly pale deep-sea octopus that lays its eggs only
    on the stalks of nodule-dwelling sponges. Remove the nodules in order to melt
    them down and it will, presumably, take millions of years for new ones to form.

- en: 'Edith Widder is a marine biologist, a MacArthur Fellow, and the author of “[Below
    the Edge of Darkness: A Memoir of Exploring Light and Life in the Deep Sea](https://www.amazon.com/Below-Edge-Darkness-Memoir-Exploring/dp/0525509240)”
    (Random House). Widder is an expert on bioluminescence, a topic that she became
    interested in after nearly going blind. In 1970, when she was a freshman in college,
    she had to have surgery for a broken back. The surgery went fine, but afterward
    she started hemorrhaging. Her heart stopped beating, and she was resuscitated.
    This happened again, and then a third time. Blood leaked into both of her eyes,
    blocking her retinas. “My visual world was swirling darkness with occasional glimpses
    of meaningless light,” she recalls. Eventually, she regained her vision, but she
    no longer took sight for granted.'

    House）的作者。Widder是生物发光的专家，她对这个话题的兴趣源于几乎失明的经历。1970年，当她还是大一学生时，她因为背部骨折接受了手术。手术进行得很顺利，但之后她开始出血。她的心脏停止跳动，她被复苏了。这种情况再次发生，然后第三次。血液渗入她双眼，阻塞了视网膜。“我的视觉世界是漩涡般的黑暗，偶尔看到毫无意义的光，”她回忆道。最终，她恢复了视力，但再也不会把视觉视为理所当然。

    “sunlight zone” extends down about seven hundred feet, the “twilight zone” down
    another twenty-six hundred feet. Below that—in the “midnight zone,” the “abyssal
    zone,” and the “hadal zone”—there’s only blackness, and the light created by life
    itself. In this vast darkness, so many species have mastered the art of bioluminescence
    that Widder estimates they constitute a “majority of the creatures on the planet.”
    The first time she descended into the deep in an armored diving suit called a
    *Wasp*, she was overwhelmed by the display. “This was a light extravaganza unlike
    anything I could have imagined,” she writes. “Afterwards, when asked to describe
    what I had seen, I blurted, ‘It’s like the Fourth of July down there!’ ”

- en: Bioluminescent creatures produce light via chemical reaction. They synthesize
    luciferins, compounds that, in the presence of certain enzymes, known as luciferases,
    oxidize and give off photons. The trick is useful enough that bioluminescence
    has evolved independently some fifty times. Eyes, too, have evolved independently
    about fifty times, in creatures as diverse as flies, flatworms, and frogs. But,
    Widder points out, “there is one remarkable distinction.” All animals’ eyes employ
    the same basic strategy to convert light to sensation, using proteins called opsins.
    In the case of bioluminescence, different groups of organisms produce very different
    luciferins, meaning that each has invented its own way to shine.

    like the stoplight loosejaw, a fish with photon-emitting organs under each eye,
    use bioluminescence to seek out prey. Others, like the humpback blackdevil, hope
    to attract victims with their displays; the blackdevil sports a shiny lure that
    dangles off its forehead like a crystal from a chandelier.

    entice mates and to startle enemies. The giant red mysid, a hamster-size crustacean,
    spews streams of blue sparkles from nozzles near its mouth; these, it’s believed,
    distract would-be attackers. Some animals smear their pursuers with bioluminescent
    slime—the marks make them targets for other predators—and some use bioluminescence
    as camouflage. This last strategy is known as counterillumination, and it’s used
    in the twilight zone, where many creatures have upward-looking eyes that scan
    for the silhouettes of prey. The prey can adjust their glow to blend in with the
    light filtering down from above.

    once there, to record what they’re seeing—Widder has spent much of her career
    trying to figure out ways to study bioluminescence remotely. She’s developed special
    deep-sea cameras that rely on red light, which marine creatures mostly can’t detect.
    Much of “Below the Edge of Darkness” is occupied with the travails of getting
    these cameras placed, a project that involves journeys so nauseating that Widder
    describes cycling through the five stages of seasickness. In the fourth, she explains,
    “you’re afraid you’re going to die,” and in the last “you’re afraid you’re not.”
