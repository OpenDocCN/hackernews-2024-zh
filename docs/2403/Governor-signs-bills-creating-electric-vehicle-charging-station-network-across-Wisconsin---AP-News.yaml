    designed to jump-start creation of an electric vehicle charging network along
    the state’s interstate system and major highways.

    it easier for gas stations, convenience stores and other businesses to operate
    the electric vehicle charging stations. The measures were backed by businesses
    and environmentalists alike and cheered as a way for Wisconsin to expand its electric
    vehicle charging network.

    for passenger electric vehicles to be recharged in less than an hour. Lower level
    chargers are designed to recharge a vehicle overnight or throughout the day.

    stations. The state Department of Transportation has said it expects to use the
    $78.7 million in federal grants to support building 65 high-speed charging stations
    in key corridors using the federal funding unlocked through enactment of the new
    laws.

    to help businesses construct charging stations over the next five years. The grants
    would cover up to 80% of costs; grant recipients would have to put up the remaining
    20%.

    to move away from gasoline-powered cars and trucks that contribute to global warming.

    known as a kilowatt-hour. Selling by the killowatt-hour is similar to fueling
    a vehicle with gasoline.

    any business that wanted to offer a charging station would have to be regulated
    as a utility.

    bill Evers signed allows private businesses to sell electricity at the charging
    stations by kilowatt-hour and not be regulated as a utility.

    Local government entities and state agencies would not be allowed to operate public
    charging stations but could run their own stations to charge their vehicles.

    or creating good-paying jobs and infrastructure to meet the needs of a 21st-Century
