    a higher-order domain of knowledge and practice, akin to law or engineering. That

    humankind relies on, and they are expected to solve problems. The liberal-arts
    field of mathematics, by contrast, is concerned with theory and abstraction. The
    relationship between the theoretical computer scientists in mathematics and the
    applied ones in engineers is a little like the relationship between biologists
