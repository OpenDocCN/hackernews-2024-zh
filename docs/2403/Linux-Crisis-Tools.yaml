    ones are more capable (e.g., CLI options), and the bpftrace ones can be edited
    on the fly. But that''s not to say that one is better or faster than the other:
    They emit the same BPF bytecode and are equally fast once running. Also note that
    bcc is evolving and migrating tools from Python to libbpf C (with CO-RE and BTF)
    but we haven''t reworked the package yet. In the future "bpfcc-tools" should get
    replaced with a much smaller "libbpf-tools" package that''s just tool binaries.'

    analysis tools installed as well: e.g., on Intel GPU servers, the intel-gpu-tools
    package; on NVIDIA, nvidia-smi. Debugging tools, like gdb(1), can also be pre-installed
    for immediate use in a crisis.'

    only need updating every few years. If you think I missed a package that is important
    today, please let me know (e.g., in the comments).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The main downside of adding these packages is their on-disk size. On cloud instances,
    adding Mbytes to the base server image can add seconds, or fractions of a second,
    to instance deployment time. Fortunately the packages I've listed are mostly quite
    small (and bcc will get smaller) and should cost little size and time. I have
    seen this size concern prevent debuginfo (totaling around 1 Gbyte) from being
    included by default.

- en: The above scenario explains why you ideally want to pre-install crisis tools
    so you can start debugging a production issue quickly during an outage. Some companies
    already do this, and have OS teams that create custom server images with everything
    included. But there are many sites still running default versions of Linux that
    learn this the hard way. I'd recommend Linux distros add these crisis tools to
    their enterprise Linux variants, so that companies large and small can hit the
    ground running when performance outages occur.
