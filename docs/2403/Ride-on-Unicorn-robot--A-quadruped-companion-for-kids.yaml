- en: The latent potential for personal robotics became very real for me while I was
    strolling the halls of the [45th Bangkok International Motor Show](https://www.motorshow.in.th/en/home-en/)
    this week. There are always good ideas at motor shows, except the good ideas at
    motor shows in developing regions seem to be far more affordable and practical
    than they are in more advanced economies ... and once more the Bangkok Motor Show
    delivered a pearl.

- en: The star of the show for the attendees was unquestionably the XPeng flying car
    prototype that begins production in 2025\. It was the first time Thailand had
    seen a flying car in the flesh, though XPeng's rise as a credible challenger to
    Tesla and its insistence that the 2025 production date is solid clearly added
    to the narrative. The excitement is that a flying car will soon be attainable,
    if not quite affordable.

    flying cars under development, XPeng now has the credibility to become a market
    maker.

- en: Hence it’s understandable that the flying car of parent company Xpeng got all
    the attention from the media. Xiaopeng Motors (known as XPeng) was founded just
    over a decade ago in Guangzhou, but growth has been rapid, funding has been forthcoming
    and in 2020, [the company went public on the New York Stock Exchange](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/XPEV?p=XPEV&.tsrc=fin-srch),
    raising US$1.5 billion.

    no video screen, indeed there was no information about what it was at all. Not
    surprisingly, no-one was paying the robotic Great Dane any attention.

    the crowd 20 meters away was ignoring something I considered ground-breaking and
    potentially more important in the long term.

- en: The idea of a quadruped companion for children had been shown as a concept 18
    months ago, but at that time the gargantuan looming presence of practical Artificial
    Intelligence had not been recognized and although the idea of the quadruped offering
    a pony-like experience was novel, I think most people consigned it to the same
    booty-shaking companion category as Sony's Aibo and a battalion of other quadruped
    robots under development around the world.

- en: The addition of an extra capable retractable arm instead of a tail has increased
    the capability of the Unicorn to potentially very useful as a personal service
    robot.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The first thing we need to recognize is that by turning the unicorn's tail into
    a miniature industrial-quality robotic arm, the practicality of the Unicorn has
    made a quantum forward leap. Though details are difficult to pin down, my understanding
    is that the tail will be capable of grasping, lifting and carrying objects up
    to 3 kg and we can clearly see that development on all fronts in the XPeng empire
    appears to be at blitzkrieg pace, so as the software develops for such fetch and
    carry capabilities, genuine usefulness appears likely.

- en: Being able to say to your unicorn companion, "can you pass me the 5/8 open ender
    please" when you're wedged under a car might be just the start. XPeng is intent
    on leveraging the burgeoning capability of Artificial Intelligence and the Unicorn
    now looks to have the framework to become an intelligent, articulate and physically
    capable collaborator in almost any endeavor you can think of.

    the rear legs.

    my first few minutes observing the Unicorn convinced me it has achieved its goal.
    I have little doubt that my (sadly) anonymous little friend will remember this
    encounter - his clockspeed went up as I watched.

    convinced me of the potential for this product.

- en: I feel certain he knew what it was intended for from the get-go. He stared at
    the Unicorn in fascination. I swear I could see the synapses firing in his brain
    as he became absolutely absorbed in it and ... even after a few minutes when mum
    wanted to move on, he was staying exactly where he was. It was a completely inanimate
    quadruped with no lights or sound, and although he might not have understood its
    full functional capabilities, rest assured he **was sold**!

    there's a future industry in children's robotics that has significant upsides,
    particularly in being able to feed inquisitive minds with solid understanding
    at a time when they remember everything.

    having a companion that can answer any question (or depending on the AI rules
    you set as parents, refer the query on to you for assessment on how to handle)
    might have significant benefits in building better-balanced, better-informed humans.

    particularly formative stage of life aside, we're hurtling towards the future
    ... think of the Unicorn as training for what lies ahead.
