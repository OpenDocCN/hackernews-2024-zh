- en: When I started tagging the plants in my garden, I realized classic plant markers
    are tricky. They emphasize my terrible handwriting, it’s hard to fit much information
    on them, and they fade. They also try to be the center of attention in the garden.
    That problem motived me and some of my friends to start exploring better labeling
    options.

    you remember how you’ve grown as a gardener over time. Known plant labels are
    the simplest way to help you do that — it just takes a tap to get started.
