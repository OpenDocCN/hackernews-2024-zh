    option. Larger wind turbines produce more power than standard ones, but the components
    are too big to be transported by road.

    It’s developing the biggest aircraft in aviation history.

    blades directly to wind farms.

    fuel and needs only a simple packed-dirt or gravel runway to land on.

    “can land on airstrips as short as 6,000 feet (1,800 meters), something no other
    large commercial aircraft can achieve.”

    hold three Olympic swimming pools. That’s 12 times the volume of a Boeing 747-400
    and – at 356 feet in length, it’s 127 feet longer too.

- en: The aircraft’s scale might be groundbreaking, but the engineering is not – and
    that’s by design. Radia says it’s focusing “on existing technology and safety
    by using, where applicable, tried-and-true aviation materials, components and
    fabrication techniques that have FAA [US Federal Aviation Administration] approval,
    are already in mass production and are lowest-risk.”

    aerospace industry standards. Online reports say commercial operations as soon
    as 2027, but there’s no timeline confirmed on Radia’s website. CNN has reached
    out to the company for comment.

- en: Radia is banking on research organisation Bloomberg NEF’s estimation that up
    to $10 trillion will be spent on onshore wind through 2050\. The development of
    WindRunner is to enable GigaWind, the XXL turbines made by Radia’s partners, which
    include five of the world’s top six turbine manufacturers.

- en: Currently, turbine blades today are ordinarily 230 feet or less (70 meters),
    but Radia wants to deploy blades of up to 104 meters (341 feet). The company says
    GigaWind turbines could potentially be two to three times more powerful – and
    two to three times more profitable than those typically deployed today.

    Lundstrum, a cross-industry entrepreneur and MIT aerospace engineer who founded
    Radia in 2016\. The company says its team of advisers include former top brass
    from Boeing, MIT, Rolls-Royce and the FAA, as well as former US Secretary of Energy
    Ernest Moniz and former Prime Minister of Australia Malcolm Turnbull.

    is a smart one. Might we see a WindRunner take off before the end of the decade?
    Could its distinctive shape one day be as popular as the [Beluga XL](https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/airbus-beluga-whale-plane-charters/index.html)
    transporter planes created by Airbus? Watch the skies.
