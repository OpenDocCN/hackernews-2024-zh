    scrolling and after that 'translate', and it also used less CPU than Firefox.

    8.0 (including months of NetBSD/OpenBSD/DragonFly/OpenSolaris), but after that
    I have mainly been using macOS on my laptop. And I had Windows on my PC for the
    last 3-4 years to play World of Warcraft (which sometimes works OK with wine,
    but some patches break, and I got tired of fixing it every other update).

    my Windows as a "hacked" public computer, and due to no full disk encryption,
    I never put anything sensitive on it, and therefore never worked on it. A few
    days ago my SSD died, and I installed Ubuntu 23.10 on the new SSD, with full disk
    encryption and beautifully set up Emacs.

    which was a huge blocker for me because I am in The Netherlands, and I don't speak
    Dutch, so I have to constantly translate things because most sites just infer
    the language from the IP address rather than the Accept-Language headers.

    have to recompile the kernel.

- en: I feel over the years Apple has been treating its users more and more like children,
    e.g., when you compile a program and the first time you run it, it starts slowly
    because "something" has to decide if it's "allowed" or should be quarentined,
    or you can't *gdb -p* into a process. Every time it does that it just pisses me
    off so much. Since M1 came out, I can say only good things about the hardware,
    my mac often has 100-200 days uptime, battery life of 10+ hours.. I just cant
    stand the patronizing attitude.
