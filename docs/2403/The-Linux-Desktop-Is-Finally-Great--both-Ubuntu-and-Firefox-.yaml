    scrolling and after that 'translate', and it also used less CPU than Firefox.

- en: I have been using Linux since Slack 3.6, FreeBSD for a while between 2.2.8 and
    8.0 (including months of NetBSD/OpenBSD/DragonFly/OpenSolaris), but after that
    I have mainly been using macOS on my laptop. And I had Windows on my PC for the
    last 3-4 years to play World of Warcraft (which sometimes works OK with wine,
    but some patches break, and I got tired of fixing it every other update).

- en: I never managed to make my Windows PC feel like home; I just always treated
    my Windows as a "hacked" public computer, and due to no full disk encryption,
    I never put anything sensitive on it, and therefore never worked on it. A few
    days ago my SSD died, and I installed Ubuntu 23.10 on the new SSD, with full disk
    encryption and beautifully set up Emacs.

- en: Firefox surprised me the most; it is so smooth, and now it has translations,
    which was a huge blocker for me because I am in The Netherlands, and I don't speak
    Dutch, so I have to constantly translate things because most sites just infer
    the language from the IP address rather than the Accept-Language headers.

    so I had to google how to fix it, but after that, WoW plays with 200-300 fps without
    issues on a 3080, has no input lag, and all my weakauras and addons just work,
    the text-to-speech is crap though (I use it to tell me when some important cooldowns
    are ready).

    In the past, I have mainly been using EXWM, i3, and awesome, but now I just use
    the Ubuntu default window manager; I don't even know its name. I also did not
    have to recompile the kernel.

- en: I feel over the years Apple has been treating its users more and more like children,
    e.g., when you compile a program and the first time you run it, it starts slowly
    because "something" has to decide if it's "allowed" or should be quarentined,
    or you can't *gdb -p* into a process. Every time it does that it just pisses me
    off so much. Since M1 came out, I can say only good things about the hardware,
    my mac often has 100-200 days uptime, battery life of 10+ hours.. I just cant
    stand the patronizing attitude.
