- en: Aircraft manufacturers have long been aware of the [paradox of automation](https://personalmba.com/paradox-of-automation),
    where an overreliance on automation makes the human in the loop even more critical
    than before. Modern airline pilots increasingly rely on autopilot systems, but
    must be experienced enough to know when to intervene if something goes wrong.
    Blindly following the instruments in this scenario [can lead to loss of life](https://thewalrus.ca/the-deadly-price-of-the-automation-paradox/).
    But in a world where more and more basic operational tasks can be offloaded to
    an AI system, how can we expect the operators of these systems to know when things
    aren’t right?

    shouldn’t be complacent and should have a proper knowledge strategy, which includes
    training in-house AI on their own practices and standards. AI should be a force
    multiplier for senior engineers to 10x their impact within their team and practice.”

    of AI strategy at digital services provider Zartis. “Every business has a prerogative
    to ensure business continuity, and this is best ensured through in-person, hands-on
    practical experience with emerging tools and technology – which also means we
    need a greater degree of vocational educational programs similar to Germany's
    model,” he says. Famously, German businesses often provide [mid-career training](https://www.raconteur.net/insights/germanys-industrial-skills-shortage-challenges-and-solutions),

- en: The big question is if these tools will cause a generational shift in how software
    is developed, or are just the latest in a long line of productivity enhancers
    to be resisted and eventually embraced. “Developers are not strangers to the concept
    of lifelong learning,” points out Michael Erquitt, senior security engineer at
    Security Journey. “There will always be new technologies and techniques in this
    industry.”

  zh: 最大的问题是这些工具是否会导致软件开发方式的代际转变，或者只是长期生产力增强工具系列的最新成员，将被抵制并最终被接受。“开发人员对终身学习的概念并不陌生，”Security
    Journey的高级安全工程师Michael Erquitt指出。“在这个行业中，总会有新的技术和技巧。”
- en: Erquitt believes the likely outcome for how AI models are deployed within the
    sector is that, over the next five to 10 years, the technology will become “a
    great force multiplier for augmenting the developer process”. That’ll allow developers
    to focus on other elements of the job.

- en: “My very strong intuition is that, at least for the people who actually want
    to learn this stuff, this is a learning accelerant,” says Willison. “If you're
    just getting started coding right now, and you're not the kind of person who just
    cheats, you actually do want to learn things, these are basically rocket fuel
    for the rate at which you can learn things.”

    officer at Unit4\. “Badly done software can have a material impact on an organization,
    so I doubt that today’s software engineers are using generative AI to automate
    development for critical medical applications or space flights to Mars.”

- en: This creates a greater need than ever for developers to be able to not just
    write code, but interrogate it. “The critical part of the role is to understand
    what the code needs to do. What is the expectation? What is the performance requirement?
    What are the underlying architectural and operational requirements? All of this
    thinking is integral to software engineering,” Jepsen says.

  zh: 这使得开发人员不仅仅需要编写代码，而是需要审视代码，成为比以往任何时候都更为迫切的需求。“角色的关键部分是理解代码需要做什么。期望是什么？性能要求是什么？底层架构和操作需求是什么？所有这些思考都是软件工程的核心内容”，Jepsen说道。
- en: The temptation to offload the basic elements of any job can be compelling, but
    the risk lies in losing that connection to the complex systems underpinning those
    tasks. “Writing the code is a smaller part of the discipline,” says Jepsen, “but
    if you start sacrificing the code writing skills you’ll be in trouble.”
