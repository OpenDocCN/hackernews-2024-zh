- en: Astronomers have used the James Webb and Hubble space telescopes to confirm
    one of the most troubling conundrums in all of physics — that the universe appears
    to be expanding at bafflingly different speeds depending on where we look.

- en: This problem, known as the Hubble Tension, has the potential to alter or even
    upend cosmology altogether. In 2019, measurements by the [Hubble Space Telescope](https://www.livescience.com/tag/hubble-space-telescope)
    confirmed the puzzle was real; in 2023, even more precise measurements from the
    [James Webb Space Telescope](https://www.livescience.com/james-webb-space-telescope)
    (JWST) cemented the discrepancy.

    the possibility of any measurement error to bed for good. The study, published
    February 6 in the [Astrophysical Journal Letters](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/ad1ddd),
    suggests that there may be something seriously wrong with our understanding of
    the universe.

    constant, a value that describes the expansion rate of the universe. The first
    involves poring over tiny fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background (CMB)
    — an ancient relic of the universe's first light produced just 380,000 years after
    the [Big Bang](https://www.livescience.com/65700-big-bang-theory.html).

    [European Space Agency](https://www.livescience.com/tag/european-space-agency)'s
    Planck satellite to infer a Hubble constant of roughly 46,200 mph per million
    light-years, or roughly 67 kilometers per second per megaparsec (km/s/Mpc).

    are dying, and their outer layers of helium gas grow and shrink as they absorb
    and release the star's radiation, making them periodically flicker like distant
    signal lamps.

- en: As Cepheids get brighter, they pulsate more slowly, giving astronomers a means
    to measure their absolute brightness. By comparing this brightness to their observed
    brightness, astronomers can chain Cepheids into a "cosmic distance ladder" to
    peer ever deeper [into the universe's past](https://www.livescience.com/james-webb-telescope-see-the-past).
    With this ladder in place, astronomers can find a precise number for its expansion
    from how the Cepheids' light has been stretched out, or red-shifted.

    measurement error caused by the blending of Cepheids with other stars in Hubble's
    aperture. But in 2023, the researchers used the more accurate [JWST](https://www.livescience.com/tag/james-webb-space-telescope)
    to confirm that, for the first few "rungs" of the cosmic ladder, their Hubble
    measurements were right. Nevertheless, the possibility of crowding further back

    observing 1,000 more Cepheid stars in five host galaxies as remote as 130 million
    light-years from Earth. After comparing their data to Hubble's, the astronomers
    confirmed their past measurements of the Hubble constant.

    Riess said. "Combining Webb and Hubble gives us the best of both worlds. We find
    that the Hubble measurements remain reliable as we climb farther along the cosmic
    distance ladder."'
