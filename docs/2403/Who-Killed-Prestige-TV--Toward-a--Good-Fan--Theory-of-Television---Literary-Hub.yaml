    was a thoughtless gift, debt-financed, and addressed to no one in particular.
    As it descends, and shows are made cheaper, longer, worse, we are returned to
    a natural state of televisual spectatorship: We watch anyway.'

    circulating was that the shows, past-peak in total, were also [demonstrably bad](https://slate.com/culture/2023/03/peak-tv-over-golden-age-hbo-streaming.html),
    that it’s all been “[a gold rush of trash](https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2023/05/tv-streaming-bubble-has-burst-writers-strike-looms).”
    Look, we’ve all seen some things: *The Morning Show* going hard on Covid; *Ted
    Lasso* believing in itself. Other things we haven’t seen, for example *Game of
    Thrones* Season 8, episode 3, “The Long Night,” because it was *virtually invisible*.
    But the shows have Ayo Edebiri showing her range; Rachel Fleishman’s point of
    view, in unwellness and in wellness. And if we’re between shows, the Good Fan,
    with textbook dramatic irony, rewatches for Carmela, to see if she leaves him
    this time. (“[One thing you can never say is that you haven’t been told](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzVeLjj6Ao8).”)'

    Weiss to recommend optioning one of the most popular sci-fi novels in recent memory.
