    32 harmful health effects, according to the largest review of the evidence [to

    around 15 years ago to allow researchers to investigate the effect of food processing
    on health. This new study, called an “umbrella review”, analysed many recent studies,
    involving almost 10 million people, to bring together much of the available data
    to give an overall picture of how UPFs affect our health.'

    with poor health outcomes and early death from a range of conditions, including
    heart disease, type 2 diabetes, obesity and poor mental health.

    and the new study supports the links to a wide variety of diseases. But questions
    remain about the specific mechanisms by which these foods make us ill.

- en: Researchers have proposed [several mechanisms](https://doi.org/10.1111/nbu.12623)
    over the years. These include poor nutritional quality, as some UPFs can be high
    in fat, sugar and salt, low in fibre and deficient in essential vitamins, minerals
    and antioxidants.
  id: totrans-split-11
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Other mechanisms include a [lack of structure and texture](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00394-023-03202-z),
    which speeds up eating, increases blood sugar levels and is less effective at
    reducing appetite. Much attention has also [focused on food additives](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41575-024-00893-5)
    and other chemicals, either added to food or as contaminants from packaging or
    the environment.

    results among the studies was varied, and some of the correlations were weak.
    This is probably in part due to the wide range of foods contained within the UPF
    category.

    are intensely processed using refined and reconstituted ingredients, which consumers
    may not be familiar with. This covers foods as diverse as ice-cream, snacks, [wholemeal
    bread](https://theconversation.com/ultra-processed-foods-bread-may-be-considered-one-but-that-doesnt-mean-its-all-bad-207236),
    processed meats and low-fat spreads. These very different foods containing very
    different ingredients and nutrient contents are probably going to have very different
    effects on our health.

    studies, where thousands of people record their normal dietary intake and health
    status. The analysis takes into account (“adjusts for”) various factors, such
    as age, gender and lifestyle, that can skew the figures.

    health. They don’t provide direct evidence of the mechanisms involved. We urgently
    need new research to understand how and why certain foods can cause ill-health.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Although some direct studies are possible, the long-term health effects of,
    for example, consuming high levels of food additives could be difficult and ethically
    questionable. But there is an opportunity here to investigate these effects in
    more detail using existing data. As more studies are published, the amount of
    data should surely allow us to focus on different forms of UPFs to identify the
    best and the worst.

    to extract some more precise data to help identify which foods we should avoid.

    diverse range of nutrient contents. Commercial wholemeal bread is classified as
    a UPF as is ice-cream, doughnuts and fried snacks. So it is highly likely that
    different UPFs will have a wide range of health effects.

    our consumption of UPFs that are clearly detrimental to health. Conversely, we
    should also aim to identify what aspects of these foods are the most dangerous,
    so that food manufacturers can eliminate them from our diets, as has been achieved
    with harmful ingredients such as [trans fats](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/trans-fat)
    and some [artificial colours](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1179/1077352512Z.00000000034).
