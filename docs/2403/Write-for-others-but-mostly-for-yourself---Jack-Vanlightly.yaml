- en: I started my blog originally to help me get to the next level in my career and
    help establish myself as an authority in the areas of tech that I was focusing
    on. I liked writing and thought I had something to say.

- en: Looking back at my 6 years of blogging now it’s hard to recognise myself from
    the engineer I was back then before writing was a regular habit for me. It’s funny
    because in the end my blog was the key to unlock the next door in my career but
    not necessarily for the reasons I expected. I figured if I could write some interesting
    posts I could turn up to an interview and use it as a kind of portfolio, but it
    became so much more than that.

- en: The thing that surprised me after a while of doing technical writing was that
    writing wasn’t just about me explaining something to an audience, it was a tool
    to give rigor to my thinking. I cared about my reputation and about my potential
    readers and so embarking on writing a blog post about a technical subject ended
    up involving a huge amount of work. I knew that if I wasn’t careful or was indeed
    careless about what I wrote I’d not only be wasting people’s time but I could
    be publicly ridiculed on the internet. So I only wrote about things that I had
    a fundamental understanding of or set about getting that deep understanding that
    I lacked first.

- en: The great thing about writing is that it uncovers all these areas that you thought
    you understood but don’t. This is especially true when you know that competent
    and knowledgeable people are going to read it. You start explaining something
    in detail, about how it works, what the trade-offs are, the alternatives and so
    on and very soon your internal BS detector is going off. It’s yelling “How do
    you know that!?” and “What evidence do you have for this statement!?”. You realize
    that your knowledge is based on shaky foundations and your words are worthless.
    So you set out to learn the missing pieces, search for the insights and fundamental
    truths so that you can explain all this stuff with authenticity.

    either level up or go home. Writing forced me to learn things to a higher standard
    like nothing else.

- en: After a while of writing my blog I realized that it had taught me how to think.
    It taught me how to discover insights that few others had seen. It brought me
    to the next level I needed. Then further down the road because I wrote quality
    posts I slowly got visibility within my niche area of tech and that translated
    into more work opportunities.

- en: Now I don’t just write publicly on blogs but privately for my team when the
    subject is something I can’t share publicly or isn’t the kind of thing that I
    think is going to be valuable to others. I might write a kind of blog post about
    an imaginary feature I am envisaging, a new technique that can help us or how
    something works. Because I do share it with people I get that automatic BS detection
    in my head that tells me when my thinking is sloppy or on shaky ground. It also
    forces me to flesh out the idea, consider all its trade-offs. Sometimes it ends
    up being generally applicable enough that I can actually publish it. This is how
    my recent [Apache BookKeeper internals blog series](https://medium.com/splunk-maas/apache-bookkeeper-internals-part-1-high-level-6dce62269125)
    and my [USE metrics series](https://medium.com/splunk-maas/apache-bookkeeper-observability-part-1-introducing-the-metrics-7f0acb32d0dc)
    started. I wanted to understand BookKeeper better and share that with my colleagues
    but in the end it was so valuable that I published it.

    do to work on their “personal brand”. It can definitely help with that, but first
    and foremost it is a tool that people can use to up their game and take their
    knowledge and critical thinking to the next level.

    to better understanding and greater insight. Blogging is less popular now than
    it was but don’t let that stop you, in the end the person that benefits most,
    even if few people read it, is you.
