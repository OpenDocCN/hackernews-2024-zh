- en: I started my blog originally to help me get to the next level in my career and
    help establish myself as an authority in the areas of tech that I was focusing
    on. I liked writing and thought I had something to say.

  zh: 最初我开始写博客是为了帮助我在职业生涯中进入下一个阶段，并帮助我在我关注的技术领域内建立权威地位。我喜欢写作，而且认为我有话要说。
- en: Looking back at my 6 years of blogging now it’s hard to recognise myself from
    the engineer I was back then before writing was a regular habit for me. It’s funny
    because in the end my blog was the key to unlock the next door in my career but
    not necessarily for the reasons I expected. I figured if I could write some interesting
    posts I could turn up to an interview and use it as a kind of portfolio, but it
    became so much more than that.

  zh: 现在回顾我六年的博客经历，很难认出我曾经是那个在写作成为常规之前的工程师。有趣的是，最终我的博客成为我职业生涯中打开下一个大门的关键，但原因并非完全如我所预期。我想，如果我能写一些有趣的帖子，我就能去面试，并将其用作一种作品集，但事实证明它变得比那更重要。
- en: The thing that surprised me after a while of doing technical writing was that
    writing wasn’t just about me explaining something to an audience, it was a tool
    to give rigor to my thinking. I cared about my reputation and about my potential
    readers and so embarking on writing a blog post about a technical subject ended
    up involving a huge amount of work. I knew that if I wasn’t careful or was indeed
    careless about what I wrote I’d not only be wasting people’s time but I could
    be publicly ridiculed on the internet. So I only wrote about things that I had
    a fundamental understanding of or set about getting that deep understanding that
    I lacked first.

  zh: 一段时间从事技术写作后让我惊讶的是，写作不仅仅是我向观众解释某事的工具，它是给我的思维带来严谨性的工具。我关心我的声誉和潜在读者，因此着手写一篇关于技术主题的博客文章最终涉及了大量的工作。我知道，如果我不小心或确实对我所写的内容漫不经心，我不仅会浪费人们的时间，还可能会在互联网上被公开嘲笑。因此，我只写我有根本理解的事物，或者首先努力获得我缺乏的深刻理解。
- en: The great thing about writing is that it uncovers all these areas that you thought
    you understood but don’t. This is especially true when you know that competent
    and knowledgeable people are going to read it. You start explaining something
    in detail, about how it works, what the trade-offs are, the alternatives and so
    on and very soon your internal BS detector is going off. It’s yelling “How do
    you know that!?” and “What evidence do you have for this statement!?”. You realize
    that your knowledge is based on shaky foundations and your words are worthless.
    So you set out to learn the missing pieces, search for the insights and fundamental
    truths so that you can explain all this stuff with authenticity.

  zh: 写作的伟大之处在于它揭示了你以为理解但实际并未理解的所有这些领域。特别是当你知道有胜任和知识渊博的人会阅读时。你开始详细解释某件事的工作原理，其权衡利弊，替代方案等等，很快你内心的虚伪检测器就会响起。它会大声喊：“你怎么知道那个！？”和“你对这个陈述有什么证据！？”你意识到你的知识基础不牢固，你的话是毫无价值的。因此，你开始学习缺失的部分，寻找洞察和基本真理，这样你就可以真实地解释所有这些内容。
- en: When you write regularly and face-off against this internal BS detector you
    either level up or go home. Writing forced me to learn things to a higher standard
    like nothing else.

  zh: 当你定期写作并面对内心的虚伪检测器时，你要么进步，要么离开。写作迫使我以无与伦比的高标准学习各种事物。
- en: After a while of writing my blog I realized that it had taught me how to think.
    It taught me how to discover insights that few others had seen. It brought me
    to the next level I needed. Then further down the road because I wrote quality
    posts I slowly got visibility within my niche area of tech and that translated
    into more work opportunities.

  zh: 写博客一段时间后，我意识到它教会了我如何思考。它教会了我如何发现少数人看到的洞察力。它带我达到了我需要的下一个水平。然后在更长的路途中，因为我写了优质的文章，我在我专注的技术领域内慢慢获得了可见性，这转化为了更多的工作机会。
- en: Now I don’t just write publicly on blogs but privately for my team when the
    subject is something I can’t share publicly or isn’t the kind of thing that I
    think is going to be valuable to others. I might write a kind of blog post about
    an imaginary feature I am envisaging, a new technique that can help us or how
    something works. Because I do share it with people I get that automatic BS detection
    in my head that tells me when my thinking is sloppy or on shaky ground. It also
    forces me to flesh out the idea, consider all its trade-offs. Sometimes it ends
    up being generally applicable enough that I can actually publish it. This is how
    my recent [Apache BookKeeper internals blog series](https://medium.com/splunk-maas/apache-bookkeeper-internals-part-1-high-level-6dce62269125)
    and my [USE metrics series](https://medium.com/splunk-maas/apache-bookkeeper-observability-part-1-introducing-the-metrics-7f0acb32d0dc)
    started. I wanted to understand BookKeeper better and share that with my colleagues
    but in the end it was so valuable that I published it.

  zh: 现在我不仅在博客上公开写作，还在团队内部写作，当主题是我不能公开分享的或者不是我认为对他人有价值的内容时。我可能会写一篇关于我正在设想的虚构功能、一种新技术或者某种工作原理的博客文章。因为我会与人分享这些想法，所以我的大脑中会自动检测到一些糟糕或者站不住脚的想法。这也迫使我深入探讨这些想法，考虑所有的权衡。有时候最终会发现这些想法是普遍适用的，我甚至可以把它们发表出来。这就是我最近的[Apache
    BookKeeper 内部系列博客](https://medium.com/splunk-maas/apache-bookkeeper-internals-part-1-high-level-6dce62269125)和我的[USE
    指标系列](https://medium.com/splunk-maas/apache-bookkeeper-observability-part-1-introducing-the-metrics-7f0acb32d0dc)的起源。我想更好地理解
    BookKeeper 并与同事分享，但最终发现它如此有价值，于是我把它发表了。
- en: My recommendation is that you don’t look at blog writing as just something people
    do to work on their “personal brand”. It can definitely help with that, but first
    and foremost it is a tool that people can use to up their game and take their
    knowledge and critical thinking to the next level.

  zh: 我建议你不要把博客写作仅仅看作是人们用来打造他们的“个人品牌”的一种方式。它确实可以帮助实现这一点，但首先它是人们可以用来提升自己水平、提高知识和批判性思维的工具。
- en: It is like training for your thinking, it makes you more powerful which translates
    to better understanding and greater insight. Blogging is less popular now than
    it was but don’t let that stop you, in the end the person that benefits most,
    even if few people read it, is you.
