    the global leader in the development of standards for the microelectronics industry,
    is pleased to announce the publication of JESD239 Graphics Double Data Rate (GDDR7)
    SGRAM.  This groundbreaking new memory standard is available for free download
    from the [JEDEC website](https://www.jedec.org/standards-documents/docs/jesd239). 
    JESD239 GDDR7 offers double the bandwidth over GDDR6, reaching up to 192 GB/s
    per device, and is poised to meet the escalating demand for more memory bandwidth
    in graphics, gaming, compute, networking and AI applications.'

- en: JESD239 GDDR7 is the first JEDEC standard DRAM to use the Pulse Amplitude Modulation
    (PAM) interface for high frequency operations.  Its PAM3 interface improves the
    signal to noise ratio (SNR) for high frequency operation while enhancing energy
    efficiency.  By using 3 levels (+1, 0, -1) to transmit 3 bits over 2-cycles versus
    the traditional NRZ (non-return-to-zero) interface transmitting 2 bits over 2-cycles,
    PAM3 offers higher data transmission rate per cycle resulting in improved performance.
