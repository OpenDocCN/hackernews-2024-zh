    England for the bright lights of [London](https://www.theguardian.com/uk/london)

    county of Westmorland, now part of [Cumbria](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/cumbria),
    have survived the intervening 300 years. On Tuesday they go on display at Townend,
    the Browne family home that is now cared for by the National Trust.

- en: The letters are full of vivid descriptions of Browne’s new life in London, where
    he trained as a clerk to a lawyer, as well as his need for funds. Early on, he
    encountered social unrest in the form of violent protests by Spitalfields silk
    weavers against imports of calico from India. It was, he wrote home, a “very great
    mobbing by the weavers of this town … they are starved for want of trade”.

- en: As time went on, his letters frequently requested money to help pay his rent,
    and to buy stockings, breeches, wigs and other items necessary to his new life.
    He hoped his parents would not think him extravagant, but “… my Cloaths which
    [I] have now are but mean in Comparison [with] what they wear here”.

    and was annoyed to discover his father had apprenticed him to his employer for
    five years. “I have Lost the prime of my Youth,” he complained.

    maintained a lively social life, meeting friends, and eating and drinking around
    Fleet Street, close to the Inns of Court. He also found the resources to indulge
    his passion for buying books.

    source various items only available in the city. He sent several snuff boxes to
    his parents, and in one letter Browne listed the requests he had fulfilled including
    a wig trunk, sealing wax and a silver thimble, a “Cap for Parson Sawrey & two
    necklaces for him”, “Linnen for a gown and cape for Mrs Birkett Merrers” and “Chocolate
    & Coffee for my mother”.

    Branch from St Albans, having courted her in secret. He begged his father for
    his blessing and forgiveness, which was duly given. Browne wrote that he “shall
    ever acknowledge the many and endearing kindnesses and affectionate advices by
    me rec’d from so indulgent and affectionate father and mother”.

    are so relatable, and they show nothing has really changed. Like the emails or
    text messages they may receive today, many parents with a child going off into
    the world will appreciate how [Browne’s father] must have felt getting news of
    [him] and requests for help, while any young person who has arrived in a big city
    to study or work will recognise the situations in which young Ben finds himself.”'

    the Lake District. His father, also named Ben Browne, kept dozens of the letters
    young Ben wrote home, but few written by the older man to his son have survived.
