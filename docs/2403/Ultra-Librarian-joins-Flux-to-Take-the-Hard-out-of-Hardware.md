### Partnering With Ultra Librarian

Ultra Librarian is the biggest name in the electronic components sector, boasting a repository of millions of parts from diverse manufacturers. Their commitment to maintaining an up-to-date and accessible library for PCB designers aligns perfectly with our goal to offer an efficient, user-friendly design experience. With Ultra Librarian providing access to the world’s largest online electronic component CAD library, Flux users are assured virtually unlimited access to any component they might need, directly published and accessible in real-time within the Flux platform.

Our decision to partner with Ultra Librarian was heavily influenced by the feedback from our community. You want more, high-quality, and trustworthy components available in the Flux library. So, we knew we had to do something big.

Gopu Achath, VP of Technology for Ultra Librarian, emphasizes the importance of fostering this partnership to help drive the industry forward,

> “The collaboration between Ultra Librarian and Flux plays a crucial role in the evolution of electronic design. We're enthusiastic about contributing to the dynamic evolution of the CAD design space as Flux endeavors to streamline and digitize the experience. Ultra Librarian continues to lead the charge ensuring CAD models remain easily accessible across various platforms.”

### Up First: Monolithic Power Systems

Together with Ultra Librarian, we’re going to be gradually bringing all of Ultra Librarian’s manufacturers into the Flux ecosystem.

We’re starting to roll out the Ultra Librarian partnership with Monolithic Power Systems (MPS), a leader in all things related to power and semiconductors. Users will now have access to over 3,500 of the company’s parts for immediate use in their designs, as well as MPS-created reference designs for inspiration. To use MPS’s parts, simply search for Monolithic Power Systems in the component library and drop them onto your canvas.

You can also follow [MPS’ Organization page](https://www.flux.ai/monolithicpower/) to get updates for new components, references designs, and other useful materials. Here are some example MPS reference designs that you can fork in Flux today!

*   [MP2338 Reference Design](https://www.flux.ai/monolithicpower/mp2338-reference-design?editor=pcb_3d) - This project involves designing a power supply circuit using the MP2338GTL step-down converter, featuring various resistors, inductors, and capacitors to regulate and filter the output voltage.
*   [MP5048A Reference Design](https://www.flux.ai/monolithicpower/mp5048a-reference-design?editor=pcb_3d) - This project is a reference design for power management using the MP5048A and includes power nets, a variety of passive components, and the MP5920GRT IC for comprehensive control and monitoring.
*   [MP2162 Reference Design](https://www.flux.ai/monolithicpower/mp2162-reference-design?editor=pcb_3d) - A power management circuit featuring the MP2162 from Monolithic Power Systems, incorporating inductors, capacitors, and resistors for

Following MPS, we’ll be bringing on many more of Ultra Librarian’s brands into our tool so users can access the same benefits from their favorite manufacturers.

### Benefits to the Flux community

This partnership brings the Flux community unprecedented advantages allowing engineers to interact directly with their favorite manufacturers from their Organization page, including parts, reference designs, and modules.

*   **Access to Verified Parts**: Direct access to parts uploaded by manufacturers themselves ensures reliability, building trust in the components used for your projects.
*   **Streamlined Design Process**: With a vast array of components readily available, the need to manually create parts is no more, enabling a smoother design process.
*   **Copilot Power Up**: The move also provides Flux’s in-tool AI design assistant, [Flux Copilot](https://www.flux.ai/p/blog/flux-copilot-the-first-ai-powered-hardware-design-assistant), with access to Ultra Librarian’s parts. Now users can work with Ultra Librarian’s parts in ways not possible anywhere else. This includes leveraging AI to read through datasheets, research, and choose amongst millions of components in the blink of an eye.

### A Milestone for Flux, and the Hardware World!

This partnership marks a big step towards bringing together all semiconductor manufacturers, distributors, engineers, and the whole hardware industry. We envision a future where designers and manufacturers can collaborate, where designers can find reliable, high-quality electronic components, and teams can create innovative hardware. This collaboration is a significant step towards that future.
