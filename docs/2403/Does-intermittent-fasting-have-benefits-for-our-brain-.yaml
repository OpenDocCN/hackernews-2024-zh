    or manage their [weight](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8683964/).

    consumed, macronutrient composition (the ratios of fats, protein and carbohydrates
    we eat) and when meals are consumed – are factors in our lifestyle we can change.

    where food intake is limited for 12 to 48 hours (usually 12 to 16 hours per day),
    followed by periods of normal food intake. The intermittent component means a
    re-occurrence of the pattern rather than a “one off” fast.

    from fasting due to its specific and potentially harmful biochemical alterations

- en: The goal of many intermittent fasting routines is to flip a “[metabolic switch](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5913738/)”
    to go from burning predominately carbohydrates to burning fat. This is called
    ketosis and typically occurs after 12–16 hours of fasting, when liver and glycogen
    stores are depleted. [Ketones](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK493179/)
    – chemicals produced by this metabolic process – become the preferred energy source
    for the brain.
