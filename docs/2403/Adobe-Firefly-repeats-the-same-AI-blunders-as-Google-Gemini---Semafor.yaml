- en: Firefly, Adobe’s AI image creation tool, repeats some of the same controversial
    mistakes that Google’s Gemini made in inaccurate racial and ethnic depictions,
    illustrating the challenges tech companies face across the industry.

    its Gemini image creation tool last month after critics pointed out that it was
    creating historically inaccurate images, depicting America’s Founding Fathers
    as Black, for instance, and refusing to depict white people. CEO Sundar Pichai
    told employees the company “[got it wrong](https://www.semafor.com/article/02/27/2024/google-ceo-sundar-pichai-calls-ai-tools-responses-completely-unacceptable).”

    tripped up Gemini. The two services rely on similar techniques for creating images
    from written text, but they are trained on very different datasets. Adobe uses
    only stock images or images that it licenses.

    company, has never been a hotbed of employee activism like Google. The common
    denominator is the core technology for image generation, and companies can attempt
    to corral it, but there is no guaranteed way to do it.

- en: I asked Firefly to create images using similar prompts that got Gemini in trouble.
    It created Black soldiers fighting for Nazi Germany in World War II. In scenes
    depicting the Founding Fathers and the constitutional convention in 1787, Black
    men and women were inserted into roles. When I asked it to create a comic book
    character of an old white man, it drew one, but also gave me three others of a
    Black man, a Black woman and a white woman. And yes, it even drew me a picture
    of Black Vikings, just like Gemini.

    ensure that certain groups of people avoid racist stereotypes — that doctors not
    all be white men, for instance, or that criminals not fall into racial stereotypes.
    But the projection of those efforts into historical contexts has infuriated some
    on the right who see it as the AI trying to rewrite history along the lines of
    today’s politics.

- en: The Adobe results show how this issue is not exclusive to one company or one
    type of model. And Adobe has, more than most big tech companies, tried to do everything
    by the book. It [trained](https://www.adobe.com/products/firefly.html) its algorithm
    on stock images, openly licensed content, and public domain content so that its
    customers could use its tool without worries about copyright infringement.
