- en: 'As the state faces economic headwinds, California''s mega high-speed rail project
    between San Francisco to Los Angeles also faces major funding hurdles, the project''s
    CEO Brian Kelly told state lawmakers Tuesday. Kelly testified in front of the
    State Senate''s Transportation Committee on the High-Speed Rail Authority''s updated
    draft business plan. In Tuesday''s hearing, Kelly told lawmakers the project has
    $28 billion dollars on hand, but noted it was still a few billion dollars short
    to complete the Central Valley segment between Merced and Bakersfield. Depending
    on how long the segment takes to finish, it could cost between $32 Billion to
    $35 Billion. Kelly said the project is hoping to fill the gap with federal funds.
    That segment of the project is expected to be fully operational between 2030 and
    2033, Kelly said. Project leaders estimate it will still need an additional $100
    billion to finish what voters were originally pitched in 2008: a bullet train
    that runs between San Francisco and Los Angeles. A timeline on its completion
    has not been set as the authority waits for environmental clearances for those
    segments. "It''s been tough to fund a project with something that has an expiration
    date," Kelly noted. "We''re doing it in building blocks. We''re giving you the
    portions we think we can get done with the funding we have." Kelly told lawmakers
    he''s encouraged by an ongoing discussion with the Biden administration on establishing
    a railroad trust fund, and recent funds it received through the Bipartisan Infrastructure
    Act. Kelly said the project needs a strong, long-term federal partner. State Senators
    on both sides of the aisle expressed serious concerns with the funding gap. Democratic
    State Senator Ben Allen noted a significant portion of the state''s funds meant
    to reduce greenhouse gas emissions are going toward the project. Republican State
    Senator Kelly Seyarto said "the air is being sucked out of the room by this one
    project." "How do we get the public on board with something that has this much
    of a downside funding wise?" Seyarto asked. "I think the only way you get the
    public is by performing better and I think the authority is performing better
    today than it was and I think it will going forward," Kelly replied. "I think
    it''s the right thing to do for the state and country. And yes, it''s a challenge.
    And just like when I worked on the Bay Bridge years ago, and you''re stuck in
    the middle of a very tough project, it feels impossible until it''s not and then
    you grind, you do the work, you perform better and you deliver." Kelly said he
    also sees possible opportunities with the private sector. "You can use private
    sector partners when you are in a segment where it''s likely to be profitable,"
    he said. "I think that''s hard to do in the Central Valley, but more likely in
    the Bay Area and Los Angeles regions."'
