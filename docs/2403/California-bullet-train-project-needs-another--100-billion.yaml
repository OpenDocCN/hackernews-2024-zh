    between San Francisco to Los Angeles also faces major funding hurdles, the project''s
    CEO Brian Kelly told state lawmakers Tuesday. Kelly testified in front of the
    State Senate''s Transportation Committee on the High-Speed Rail Authority''s updated
    draft business plan. In Tuesday''s hearing, Kelly told lawmakers the project has
    $28 billion dollars on hand, but noted it was still a few billion dollars short
    to complete the Central Valley segment between Merced and Bakersfield. Depending
    on how long the segment takes to finish, it could cost between $32 Billion to
    $35 Billion. Kelly said the project is hoping to fill the gap with federal funds.
    That segment of the project is expected to be fully operational between 2030 and
    2033, Kelly said. Project leaders estimate it will still need an additional $100
    billion to finish what voters were originally pitched in 2008: a bullet train
    that runs between San Francisco and Los Angeles. A timeline on its completion
    has not been set as the authority waits for environmental clearances for those
    segments. "It''s been tough to fund a project with something that has an expiration
    date," Kelly noted. "We''re doing it in building blocks. We''re giving you the
    portions we think we can get done with the funding we have." Kelly told lawmakers
    he''s encouraged by an ongoing discussion with the Biden administration on establishing
    a railroad trust fund, and recent funds it received through the Bipartisan Infrastructure
    Act. Kelly said the project needs a strong, long-term federal partner. State Senators
    on both sides of the aisle expressed serious concerns with the funding gap. Democratic
    State Senator Ben Allen noted a significant portion of the state''s funds meant
    to reduce greenhouse gas emissions are going toward the project. Republican State
    Senator Kelly Seyarto said "the air is being sucked out of the room by this one
    project." "How do we get the public on board with something that has this much
    of a downside funding wise?" Seyarto asked. "I think the only way you get the
    public is by performing better and I think the authority is performing better
    today than it was and I think it will going forward," Kelly replied. "I think
    it''s the right thing to do for the state and country. And yes, it''s a challenge.
    And just like when I worked on the Bay Bridge years ago, and you''re stuck in
    the middle of a very tough project, it feels impossible until it''s not and then
    you grind, you do the work, you perform better and you deliver." Kelly said he
    also sees possible opportunities with the private sector. "You can use private
    sector partners when you are in a segment where it''s likely to be profitable,"
    he said. "I think that''s hard to do in the Central Valley, but more likely in
    the Bay Area and Los Angeles regions."'

  zh: 当州面临经济逆风时，加州从圣弗朗西斯科到洛杉矶的巨型高速铁路项目，也面临着巨大的资金难题，该项目的CEO布赖恩·凯利（Brian Kelly）在周二向州立法机关的交通委员会作证时指出。凯利于周二的听证会上在高速铁路管理局最新的修订商业计划前向立法人员表示，该项目已经拥有280亿美元的财务储备，但还需额外的数十亿美元来完成默塞德至贝克斯菲尔德这一中央山谷段。根据这个段落完成时间的长短，其最终造价可能在320亿美元至350亿美元之间。凯利表示，该项目计划通过联邦资金来填补缺口。预计项目中的这一个部分将在2030年至2033年之间完全运营。项目领导人估计，为了完成原计划于2008年提出的、从旧金山通往洛杉矶的直达列车这一目标，项目还需要额外的1000亿美元。完成这一目标的时间线并未设定，因为当局正在等待特定段落的环境许可。凯利指出：“资金来源缺乏项目期限存在截止日期，是资金筹集面临的困难。”他强调：“我们正在以基石的方式进行项目实施，这是我们在当前可用资金范围内能够完成的部分。”他对民主党州参议员本·艾伦（Ben
    Allen）指出州用于减少温室气体排放的资金中大部分被用于项目表示担忧回应说：“有个项目正在抽干我们的资金。”艾伦激动地问道：“公众如何对该费用如此高昂的项目表示接受？”“我认为只有通过改善绩效我们才能赢得公众信任，”凯利回答说，“我认为目前比过去与属下了更好，未来会继续变得更好。”他说成绩是驱动方程式的重要因素。“这对我所在的国家和州来说是正确的决策，并且是具有挑战性的。就像我多年前在海湾大桥项目工作时所经历的情况，困难似乎不断涌现，之后努力工作，项目推进，展现出更好的运作效率，并最终将其交付。”凯利表示他也看到了私营部门在推动项目发展方面的可能机遇。他说：“找出可能带来盈利的阶段，与私营部门伙伴合作将是很有益的。考虑到中央山谷部分的盈利潜力问题，这可能较为困难，但这在湾区和洛杉矶地区更有可能实现合作。”
