    early 00s, I believe an updated yet beginner-friendly exposition is long overdue.
    This book provides implementation-friendly introductions to most building blocks
    of combinatorial algorithms . . . It''s by far the quickest way to get hands-on
    experience with algorithms, and is also a great supplement to more theoretical
    expositions."'

- en: '"A clear and engaging text . . . By presenting problems first and their algorithm/data
    structure solutions later, it shows us exactly why those solutions are useful
    and how they fit into the big picture. . . . Far too many textbooks present solutions
    fully-formed with no mention of the dead ends and too-complicated solutions you’d
    hit along the way. But *Algorithmic Thinking* takes you from the initial idea
    to the final breakthrough, setbacks and all. Problem solving is a raw, real journey,
    and this book captures its spirit perfectly. I highly recommend it."'
