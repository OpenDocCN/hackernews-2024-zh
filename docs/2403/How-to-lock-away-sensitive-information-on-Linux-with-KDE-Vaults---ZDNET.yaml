    be contracts, wills, bank account information, deeds, or just about anything that
    contains details about you, your family, or your life that shouldn't find their
    way into the wrong hands.

- en: One of the best methods of locking those documents away is via encryption. Unfortunately,
    not every operating system makes it easy to manage such a task. Fortunately, if
    you opt to choose a Linux distribution that uses [the KDE Plasma desktop](https://www.zdnet.com/article/kde-neon-shows-that-the-plasma-6-linux-distro-is-something-truly-special/),
    you're in for a surprise, as encrypted folders are incredibly easy to create,
    thanks to KDE Vaults.

    create encrypted vaults to lock away your more sensitive documents. With just
    a few clicks of the mouse, you can create an encrypted vault, ready to house all
    the documents (images, and other files) that shouldn't be made available to just
    anyone who has access to your desktop.

    (where NAME is the name you've given the vault) directory, with a mount point
    of ~/Vaults/NAME. You can keep these defaults or change them if needed. For instance,
    you might want to house your vaults in a non-standard directory. Once you're okay
    with the location, click Next.

    it listed in your file manager. If you click that entry, it seems like you still
    have access to the folder. However, you only have access to the mount point and
    there will be nothing in it. The only time you can view the contents of the vault
    is when it is unlocked (which mounts the decrypted vault to the mount point).'

    will be able to access the contents within.
