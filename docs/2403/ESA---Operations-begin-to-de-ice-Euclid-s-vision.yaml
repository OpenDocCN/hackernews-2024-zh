- en: A few layers of water ice – the width of a strand of DNA – are starting to impact
    [Euclid](https://www.esa.int/Science_Exploration/Space_Science/Euclid)’s vision;
    a common issue for spacecraft in the freezing cold of space, but a potential problem
    for this highly sensitive mission that requires remarkable precision to investigate
    [the nature of the dark Universe](https://www.esa.int/Science_Exploration/Space_Science/Euclid/The_dark_Universe).
    After months of research, Euclid teams across Europe are now testing a newly designed
    procedure to de-ice the mission's optics. If successful, the operations will validate
    the mission teams’ plan to keep Euclid’s optical system as ice-free as possible
    for the rest of its life in orbit.

- en: In recent months, while fine-tuning and calibrating Euclid’s instruments after
    launch and preparing for the start of the mission’s first survey, science operations
    experts noticed a small but progressive decrease in the amount of light measured
    from stars observed repeatedly with the [visible instrument (VIS)](https://www.esa.int/Science_Exploration/Space_Science/Euclid/Euclid_s_instruments).

    tend to stick to the first surface they land on – and when they land on this highly

    brightness of the same stars at earlier times, seen by both Euclid and [ESA’s
    Gaia mission](https://www.esa.int/Science_Exploration/Space_Science/Gaia),” explains
    Mischa Schirmer, calibration scientist for the [Euclid consortium](https://www.euclid-ec.org/)
    and one of the main designers of the new de-icing plan.

    vision, as it is very difficult to build and launch a spacecraft from Earth without
    some of the water in our planet’s atmosphere creeping into it.

    the telescope was warmed up by onboard heaters and also partially exposed to the
    Sun, sublimating most of the water molecules present at launch on or very near
    Euclid’s surfaces. A considerable fraction, however, has survived, by being absorbed
    in the multi-layer insulation, and is now being slowly released in the vacuum
    of space.

- en: After a huge amount of research – including lab studies into how minuscule layers
    of ice on mirror surfaces scatter and reflect light – and months of calibrations
    in space, the team determined that several layers of water molecules are likely
    frozen onto mirrors in Euclid’s optics. Likely just a few to few tens of nanometres
    thick – equivalent to the width of a strand of DNA – it’s a remarkable testament
    to the mission’s sensitivity that it is detecting such tiny amounts of ice.

    plan to understand where the ice is in the optical system and mitigate its impact
    now and in the future, if it continues to accumulate.

    before launch and heat the entire spacecraft. Teams at mission control would send
    the commands to turn on every onboard heater for several days, slowly increasing
    temperatures from about –140 °C to, in some parts of the spacecraft, a ‘balmy’
    –3°C.

    structure of the spacecraft. As most materials heat, they expand and don’t necessarily
    return to precisely the same state after a week-long cool-down, meaning a potentially
    subtle difference in Euclid’s optical alignment. This won’t do for such a sensitive
    mission where effects can be noticed on the optics from a temperature change of
    just a fraction of a degree, requiring at least several weeks of fine recalibration.

    light-years, across more than a third of the sky, means we have to keep the mission
    incredibly stable – and that includes its temperature. Switching on the heaters
    in the payload module therefore needs to be done with extreme care.”

    optical parts of the spacecraft, located in areas where water released is unlikely
    to contaminate other instruments or optics. They will start with two of Euclid’s
    mirrors that can be warmed up independently. If the loss in light persists and
    starts to have an impact on science, they will continue to warm up other groups
    of Euclid’s mirrors, checking each time what percentage of photons they get back.

    of the mission, so a long-term solution is needed to regularly de-ice its optics
    without taking up too much precious mission time – Euclid has six years to complete
    its survey.

    conditions, there is surprisingly little published research about precisely how
    ice forms on optical mirrors and its impact on observations. Not only could Euclid
    reveal the nature of dark matter, but it could also shed light on an issue that
    has long plagued our roving eyes in space, peering down at Earth and out across
    the Universe.
