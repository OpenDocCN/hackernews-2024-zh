    big tech company. On these teams, we used Python for everything from data analysis
    to machine learning to backend services. But when it came to building user interfaces
    or apps so that others could use our work, there wasn't a good option to stay
    in Python. Suddenly, we had to switch to JavaScript and learn a whole new ecosystem.

    and [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/) that are great for building production-grade
    web apps. But they only handle the backend - you still need to use JavaScript
    and a frontend framework, as well as writing a lot of boilerplate code to connect
    the frontend and backend.

- en: On the other hand, pure Python libraries like [Dash](https://dash.plotly.com/)
    and [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) can be great for small projects, but they
    are limited to a specific use case and don't have the features and performance
    to build a full web app. As your app grows in features and complexity, you may
    find yourself hitting the limits of the framework, at which point you either have
    to limit your idea to fit the framework, or scrap your project and rebuild it
    using a "real web framework".

  id: totrans-split-21
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Full-stack web apps are made up of a frontend and a backend. The frontend is
    the user interface, and is served as a web page that runs on the user's browser.
    The backend handles the logic and state management (such as databases and APIs),
    and is run on a server.
  id: totrans-split-22
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In traditional web development, these are usually two separate apps, and are
    often written in different frameworks or languages. For example, you may combine
    a Flask backend with a React frontend. With this approach, you have to maintain
    two separate apps and end up writing a lot of boilerplate code to connect the
    frontend and backend.
  id: totrans-split-23
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We wanted to simplify this process in Reflex by defining both the frontend and
    backend in a single codebase, while using Python for everything. Developers should
    only worry about their app's logic and not about the low-level implementation
    details.
  id: totrans-split-24
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Under the hood, Reflex apps compile down to a [React](https://react.dev) frontend
    app and a [FastAPI](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi) backend app. Only the
    UI is compiled to Javascript; all the app logic and state management stays in
    Python and is run on the server. Reflex uses [WebSockets](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSockets_API)
    to send events from the frontend to the backend, and to send state updates from
    the backend to the frontend.

    [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) app and serves it on a port (by default `3000`)
    that you can access in your browser.

    create complex UIs. Instead of using a templating language that mixes HTML and
    Python, we just use Python functions to define the UI.
