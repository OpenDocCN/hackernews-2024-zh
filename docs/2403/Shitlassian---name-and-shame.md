# Shitlassian - name and shame

> Êù•Ê∫êÔºö[https://shitlassian.com/](https://shitlassian.com/)

As of today - no apologies from the company, nobody ever contacted. Managers are still there, practices are still the same. Moreover, Atlassian decided to retaliate for publishing my story, they applied zero-bonus multiplier, so I didn't get any bonus for 2020-2021\. They also refused to pay a referral fee of $5K (I invited a friend of mine to work for the company).

I made this website to share my story about getting terminated because of fighting cancer in Atlassian. Now it's the place where **you can share your story**. The process of spreading the word is ridiculously simple - you will need [Notion](https://www.notion.so/) and nothing else (see how to contribute below). You will own your story, and will be able to add updates it in a matter of seconds.

We offer a free link like [`shitlassian.com/working-at-your-company-name`](/working-at-your-company-name) or similar, so search engines can do their job. Also, this website is getting significant amount of traffic, and we share the tips how to spread the word about a toxic company.

There has been no Shitlassian for other companies yet, Atlassian is the only Shitlassian at the moment.

"**Shitlassian**" is a word/meme (noun or verb) that describes an action of employee disposal at the time of a struggle. It's similar to "throw under the bus", but with emphasis that the person tried his/her best to fight for his/her own life.

For example: *- Hey Mike, what do you think about our employee who took too much of a medical leave? - Just shitlassian him* Or: *- I heard Joe got shitlassian treatment because he was sick for too long - Poor guy*

Real world usage example:
