    with getting to the bottom of a 75-cent accounting discrepancy in the lab’s computer
    network, which was rented out to remote users by the minute. Stoll, 36, investigated
    the source of that minuscule anomaly, pulling on it like a loose thread until
    it led to a shocking culprit: a hacker in the system.'

    across the lab’s network and the nascent internet. In doing so, he revealed a
    vast web of similar intrusions into military and government agencies carried out
    by a group of young German hackers, eventually revealed to have been working in
    the service of the Soviet KGB. The story that Stoll unraveled from that tiny initial
    clue, which he published in late 1989 as a kind of digital detective memoir, *The
    Cuckoo’s Egg*, turned out to be the very first known case of state-sponsored hacking—a
    tale far bigger than he could have ever imagined when he began hunting those three
    quarters missing from his lab’s ledger.

    its 30th anniversary, the book has sold more than 1 million copies. And for a
    smaller core of cybersecurity practitioners within that massive readership, it’s
    become a kind of legend: the ur-narrative of a lone hacker hunter, a text that
    has inspired an entire generation of network defenders chasing their own anomalies
    through a vastly larger, infinitely more malicious internet.'

- en: As for 69-year-old Stoll himself, he talks about the entire series of events
    as if he still can’t believe all the fuss he’s caused. “I thought it was a weird,
    bizarre hiccup I’d stumbled into,” Stoll told me when we first spoke last year,
    after I called the home number he lists on the [very eclectic website for his
    business selling klein bottles](https://www.kleinbottle.com/)—blown-glass oddities
    that, topologically speaking, have only one side, with no inside or outside. “I
    had no idea this would become a multibillion-dollar industry. Or essential to
    running a large business. Or that the CEO of a credit reporting company could
    lose his job because of computer security. Or that thousands of people would have
    careers in the field. Or that national institutions in many countries around the
    world would devote themselves to exploiting security holes in computer networks.”

    On the day I visited Stoll in his Oakland home last month, just a few days after
    the 30th anniversary of *The Cuckoo's Egg*’s publication, he had spent the morning
    watching Mercury transit the Sun with his telescope. Stoll has a PhD in planetary
    astronomy and had intended to make stargazing his career before Lawrence Berkeley
    transferred him—not entirely voluntarily—into the IT department.

    a crate full of beautifully crafted klein bottles wrapped in paper.
