    activity (or exercise). The [World Health Organization recommends](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/physical-activity)
    150–300 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise – such as brisk walking, cycling
    and swimming – per week and muscle strengthening twice a week.

    into walking to improve your muscle strength and balance.

    muscle strength and balance in older women more than walking up stairs. When climbing

    shortening.

    eccentric walking period while the total number of steps was the same as the previous
    four weeks.
