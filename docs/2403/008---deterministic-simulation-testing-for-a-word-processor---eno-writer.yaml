- en: It's hard to overstate the cost of having bugs in your software. At best, they
    give your users little paper cuts during an otherwise positive experience, at
    worst they set your users back, leaving them wishing they had never used your
    software in the first place. Behind the scenes, the costs of bugs continue. The
    time it takes to fix a bug that has made its way into production vastly exceeds
    the time it takes to create it. It's not uncommon for a team to spend more time
    fixing bugs in a new feature than they spent actually writing it.

- en: I've taken a lot of inspiration over the last couple years from [TigerBeetle](https://tigerbeetle.com/).
    TigerBeetle is a startup that is building a financial accounting database from
    scratch in zig. You can imagine that avoiding bugs is top of mind for a company
    that is building a database from scratch to store billions (trillions?) of dollars
    of financial transactions. Joran Dirk Greef, CEO/founder, appreciates the difficulty
    of the task more than anyone, pointing out that Postgres (an extremely popular
    database), went almost 20 years with an [undiscovered bug relating to data persistence](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19119991).

- en: Joran's team is taking a multi-prong approach to ensuring TigerBeetle is bulletproof
    by the time it enters production use. One of the most interesting prongs is something
    they call deterministic simulation testing. They have written a program called
    the VOPR ("vopper") which simulates the operation of a TigerBeetle cluster and
    runs a determined sequence of actions rapidly to test whether it behaves correctly.
    The sequence of actions is generated with a random seed which means this program
    can be run over and over again producing a different sequence each time. Joran
    says its a time machine that allows them to simulate years of usage in a matter
    of hours.

    wanted to do this early, while it was still a fairly small undertaking. I also
    knew it needed to have a pithy name like the VOPR, so I called it Lincoln. Lincoln
    is a great writer but he is quite error prone. Every time he types something new
    in, he forgets a piece of it and accidentally adds some extra text. He always
    notices his mistakes eventually and goes back and fixes them. He also saves his
    work along the way, keeping a history of versions.

    end user would see. On the right is eno's internal representation of documents.
    It uses a tree data structure which I call the BFT (the "T" stands for tree).

- en: So, was writing Lincoln worth it? Absolutely yes. I am actually surprised with
    how effective this very humble script has been already. When I first got Lincoln
    working properly, it immediately uncovered two bugs which caused eno to crash.
    I was able to take the error output from these crashes and create a unittest that
    isolated the specific problems in the BFT. The bugs were then trivial to fix.
    Until now, my process for finding bugs has been to run eno and try typing stuff
    into it in various ways and see if it crashes. The issue with this is I have to
    invent ways in which I think eno might be broken. Any bug I am not creative enough
    to think of, I will miss. With Lincoln, I just run the program and before I know
    it, one of the random things it did has uncovered a bug.

- en: Once Lincoln was able to complete the Gettysburg address with no crashes, I
    started to instrument some high level performance measurements. One of my fears
    is that the BFT will not scale well as documents receive more and more edits.
    This proved to be true - my first run of Lincoln with instrumentation produced
    the following output.

    length of the average. I had anticipated this and knew one thing I would need
    to do is simplify the underlying data structure every time the user commits a
    new version of their document. Up until now, the BFT was holding every edit in
    history in a distinct tree node. I went ahead and implemented this and then ran
    Lincoln again:'

    average. The good news is that all the numbers are about 90% lower than the previous
    benchmark. I can live with that for now.

    what the future holds for Lincoln!
