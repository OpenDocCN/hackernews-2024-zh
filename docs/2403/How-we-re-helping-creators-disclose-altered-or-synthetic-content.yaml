    in the weeks ahead, beginning with the YouTube app on your phone, and soon on
    your desktop and TV. And while we want to give our community time to adjust to
    the new process and features, in the future we’ll look at enforcement measures
    for creators who consistently choose not to disclose this information. In some
    cases, YouTube may add a label even when a creator hasn't disclosed it, especially
    if the altered or synthetic content has the potential to confuse or mislead people.

    transparency around digital content. This includes our work as a [steering member](https://c2pa.org/post/google_pr/)
    of the Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity (C2PA).

    updated privacy process for people to request the removal of AI-generated or other
    synthetic or altered content that simulates an identifiable individual, including
    their face or voice. We’ll have more to share soon on how we’ll be introducing
    the process globally.
