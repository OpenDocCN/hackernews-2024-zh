- en: Dark matter is supposed to account for 85% of the mass in the universe, according
    to conventional scientific wisdom. But proponents of a radical new theory of gravity,
    in which [space-time is “wobbly”](https://www.theguardian.com/science/2023/dec/04/wobbly-spacetime-may-resolve-contradictory-physics-theories),
    say their approach could render the elusive substance obsolete.

- en: The proposition, outlined in a new paper, raises the controversial possibility
    that dark matter, which has never been directly observed, is a mirage that a substantial
    portion of the physics community has been chasing for several decades. The theory
    is viewed as quite left-field and is yet to be thoroughly tested, but the latest
    claims are creating a stir in the world of physics.

- en: There are multiple lines of evidence for dark matter, but its nature has remained
    mysterious and searches by the Large Hadron Collider have come up empty-handed.
    Last year, the [European Space Agency launched a mission, Euclid](https://www.theguardian.com/science/2023/nov/07/euclid-telescope-first-images-dark-universe-mission),
    aiming to produce a cosmic map of dark matter.

- en: The latest paper, [published on the Arxiv website](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19459)
    and yet to be peer-reviewed, raises the question of whether it even exists, drawing
    parallels between dark matter and flawed concepts of the past, such as “the ether”,
    an invisible substance that was thought to permeate all of space.

- en: “In the absence of any direct evidence for dark energy or dark matter it is
    natural to wonder whether they may be unnecessary scientific constructs like celestial
    spheres, ether, or the planet Vulcan, all of which were superseded by simpler
    explanations,” it states. “Gravity has a long history of being a trickster.”

    theory of classical gravity”. The UCL professor has spent the past five years
    developing the approach, which aims to unite the two pillars of modern physics:
    quantum theory and Einstein’s general relativity, which are fundamentally incompatible.'

- en: Oppenheim’s theory envisages the fabric of space-time as smooth and continuous
    (classical), but inherently wobbly. The rate at which time flows would randomly
    fluctuate, like a burbling stream, space would be haphazardly warped and time
    would diverge in different patches of the universe. The theory also envisions
    an intrinsic breakdown in predictability.

- en: The paper, by Oppenheim and Andrea Russo, a PhD candidate at UCL, claims this
    take on the universe could explain landmark observations of rotating galaxies
    that led to the “discovery” of dark matter. Stars at the edges of galaxies, where
    gravity is expected to be weakest based on visible matter, ought to be rotating
    more slowly than stars at the centre. But in reality, the orbital motion of stars
    does not drop off. From this, astronomers inferred the presence of a halo of unseen
    (dark) matter exerting a gravitational pull.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In Oppenheim’s approach the additional energy required to keep the stars locked
    in orbit is provided by the random fluctuations in spacetime, which in effect
    add in a background hum of gravitation. This would be negligible in a high gravity
    interaction, such as the Earth orbiting the Sun. But in low gravity situations,
    such as the fringes of a galaxy, the phenomenon would dominate – and cumulatively
    could account for the majority of the energy in the universe.

    curves without the need for dark matter or dark energy,” Oppenheim said on X.
    “We do urge caution, however, since there is other indirect evidence for dark
    matter, so further calculations and comparison with data are needed. But if it
    holds, it would appear that 95% of the energy in the universe is due to the erratic
    nature of spacetime, signalling either a fundamental breakdown in predictability
    of physics, or we are immersed in an environment which does not obey the laws
    of classical or quantum theory.”

    and Prof Geoff Penington, who have signed a 5,000:1 odds bet with Oppenheim against
    his theory being proven correct.

    one. I’ve obviously put my money where my mouth is on that front and there is

    interesting here, exploring some beautiful and novel ideas,” said Prof Andrew
    Pontzen, a cosmologist at University College London. “However, the challenge for
    replacing dark matter is that there are so many different lines of evidence that
    suggest its presence. So far they have only addressed one of these lines. Only
    time will tell whether the new ideas can truly explain the huge variety of phenomena
    that point towards dark matter.”
