- en: Last year I read a book titled **“The Nature of Technology”** by one W. Brian
    Arthur. After finishing it, it was one of those books that I wish everyone read.
    Especially if you’re interested in technology, technological progress, the notion
    wealth creation or economic growth.

    study the relationship between groups & the individual components that make them
    up.

    when it is made up of many agents and the properties of the lumpy stock market
    may be very different from the properties of an individual agent in the market.
    Complexity theorists call this a Complex System.

    literature of these complexity theorists may just look like inter-disciplinary
    science.

    as a complex system (smaller components interacting to form larger groups) and
    uses it to provide some insights about technology that may be easy to understand
    but not blatantly obvious.

    by the likes of Heinrich Hertz, Oliver Lodge and Guglielmo Marconi. Which are
    the basis of telecommunications TV Signals, Radio Signals, GPS, WiFi — basically
    all of wireless communication.

    happening inside atoms.

    relies on phenomena.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    of new technology.**'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Let us first think of some practical implications of the above statement. If
    you want to have an ecosystem that creates new technology.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We have to invest in basic scientific research and by this I mean both **teleological**
    & **non-teleological** research whose purpose is to document, curate and study
    different phenomena.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Teleological research** means investing in research whose use is obviously
    known. Like looking for the cure of cancer, if a break through in made in this
    field we know exactly how it will benefit society.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: What however I think is more important and unfortunately suppressed or discouraged
    by most institutions is the investment in **non-teleological research**. That
    is, the investment into research who’s use is not clearly outlined. An example
    is the study of flocks of birds, the origins of the universe, the behavior of
    prime numbers.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So why should we invest appropriately in research that isn’t obviously useful?
    I gave you the answer earlier. **phenomena is a prerequisite to technology**,
    you need to find the **phenomena first** before you can find something useful
    to do with it.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    for. When electricity was discovered for example by the ancient Greeks. It was
    not exactly obvious that it can be used to make power smartphones and light bulbs.

    invent the laser & the computer transistor.

    key cryptography to secure communication across networks like the internet.

    properties/phenomena of the numbers later.

    new technology we need to;

    so it is to simply study & curate phenomena, in physics, mathematics, biology,
    economics or psychology e.t.c. And then try to leverage it to do something useful.
    If you are successful and the first to do so, you probably would have invented
    new technology.**'

    There is always a temptation for governments to pursue science with particular
    commercial aims in view. But this rarely works. Had there been a stated purpose
    to quantum physics in the 1920s, it would have been deemed a failure. And yet
    quantum physics has given us the transistor, the laser, the basis of nanotechnology,
    and much else besides. Building a capacity for advanced technology is not like
    planning production in a socialist economy, but more like growing a rock garden.
    Planting, watering, and weeding are more appropriate than five-year plans***'

    something that is relevant to this section of the blog post.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    inventor, what is relevant to the discussion here however is that Jeff Bezos also
    said that to “invent” Amazon he used components that were already invented. That
    is, the logistics infrastructure that was used by Amazon to make deliveries and
    the online payments processing infrastructure.

    didn’t have to invent them. He combined two already existing technologies, online

    of other technologies.**'

    we shall conclude the above suggestion may be false.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Consider two technologies `'A'` and `'B'`. If we create a new technology by
    combining those two we now have a new technology called `'AB'`. So in total we
    have three technologies i.e `'A'`, `'B'` and `'AB'` instead of two.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now we have three technologies to combine instead of two. Which gives us `'A'`,
    `'B'`, `'AB'`, `'AAB'`, `'BAB'`, and `'ABAB'`. The new technologies ‘AAB’, ‘BAB’,
    and ‘ABAB’ are a result of combining `'A'`, `'B'` and `'AB'` together. Now we
    have six technologies to combine in different ways that will even lead to more
    technology that can also provide more ways for technology to create new technology.
    This is the phenomena referred to by Brian Arthur as increasing returns.

    used to make other technologies like Electric Cars, Laptops, Smart Watches and

    open source libraries for example does not make it less likely for developers
    to create new software.
  prefs: []

    open source software which will also make it possible to make new combinations
    of software libraries that will be used to create an even larger set of possible
    software.

- en: So if technological progress actually slows down in the real world the reason
    should never be that “we are running out of ideas” or that, “the law hanging fruit
    is gone”. The reasons may be more cultural that technical. It is less likely to
    be less hours spent on home work or lower IQ points of the population.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Also, if you are a wannabe inventor, another blueprint for creating ideas is
    to think of how to combine different technologies and **then later** think of
    what this combination can be used for — Instead of first thinking about a solution/problem
    and then trying to look for the right combination that will solve the problem.
    **This can be regarded as a form of non-teleological invention. That is, inventing
    something whose purpose or use u may not know of at first creation.**

    means “to change form”.

    a human need.

    techniques, drafting of building designs and writing are all forms of technologies.

    new technological break troughs that are otherwise unrelated are made. They often
    encounter these existing technologies.

    otherwise unrelated fields interact with previous/old/existing technologies to
    create something that is related both but also different.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A clear example of this may be the postal service. Computer technology was initially
    developed for its number crunching abilities — very little todo with communication,
    but combined with networking and suitable user interfaces. It encountered the
    concept of a postal service and transmuted/transformed it into a new sub industry
    of electronic mail (e-mail services like Gmail).

    transmuted into the use of word processors like Scrivener or Microsoft Word. Writing
    in a computer’s word processor software is very different from writing on a piece
    of paper with a pen. Papers do not require keyboards, nor do pens require electricity.
    The two new paradigms of technology are not obviously related. Computer technology
    & software encountered the act of writing and transmuted it from writing on paper
    with a pen to using a keyboard on computer software. Although the activity is
    still writing i.e the output of text, by a human using a set of devices.
