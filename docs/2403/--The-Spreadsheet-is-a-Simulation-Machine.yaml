    to reduce the messiness of our universe into an array of cells and then manipulate
    it (though don‚Äôt confuse spreadsheets with actual reality, which is many orders
    of magnitude more complex). Perhaps the biggest accounting innovation since double-entry
    bookkeeping (citation needed!), spreadsheets mean you don‚Äôt just have to look
    at a static chart or graph, you can tweak the parameters of a system and see how
    it responds or bites back.

    how small changes might make a big difference, or even how big differences might
    make none whatsoever. And because functions can be embedded within spreadsheet
    cells, this large digital grid can essentially become a small, constantly updating
    computer, the embedded text elaborating an entire virtual cosmos, working with
    both the functions and the data within each cell.

    playing with [a spreadsheet developed by scientists at the University of Colorado](https://tinyurl.com/covid-estimator)
    that focused on the aerosol spread of virus particles. By entering room dimensions,
    the number of people in the room, assumptions about behavior, mask usage, and
    more, I was able to better understand the shape and bounds of so many pronouncements
    that were swirling around during this time about what was safe behavior and how
    the disease might spread. I was able to anchor my intuition and even overcome
    some of my concerns, something that would not have been easily done without playing
    with this spreadsheet the way I did.

    cells, tissues, and even how bodies form. He explores networks upon networks,
    the interactions of DNA and RNA, wiggling and floppy proteins, and more, all of
    which affect the numerous properties of life. Intriguingly, Ball also explores
    how multicellular organisms operate differently from single-celled creatures.
    This is biology as you probably don't remember it from school.
