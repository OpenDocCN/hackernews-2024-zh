- en: The first poll is “what’s your approach to merge commits and rebase in git”?
    600 people (30% of responders) replied “I usually use merge, rarely/never rebase”.
    It’s helpful for me to know that there are a lot of people out there who rarely/never
    use rebase, because I use rebase all the time – it’s a good reminder that my experiences
    isn’t necessarily representative.

    14% of people replied “literally no idea”. That tells me to be careful about assuming
    that people know what `HEAD` means in my writing.
