- en: THE STRUGGLE over America’s elite universities—who controls them and how they
    are run—continues to rage, with lasting consequences for them and the country.
    Harvard faces a congressional investigation into antisemitism; Columbia has just
    been hit with a lawsuit alleging “endemic” hostility towards Jews. Top colleges
    are under mounting pressure to reintroduce rigorous test-based admissions policies,
    after years of backsliding on meritocracy. And it is likely that the cosy tax
    breaks these gilded institutions enjoy will soon attract greater scrutiny. Behind
    all this lies a big question. Can American universities, flabby with cash and
    blighted by groupthink, keep their competitive edge?

- en: The origins of the turmoil lie in extreme campus reactions to Hamas’s attack
    on Israel on October 7th. They led to a blockbuster congressional hearing in December.
    In it politicians accused three college presidents of failing to curtail antisemitism.
    The University of Pennsylvania’s then president, Elizabeth Magill, stepped down
    just days later. Claudine Gay, formerly Harvard’s president, [resigned](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2024/01/03/the-decline-and-fall-of-harvards-president)
    from her job in January amid twin furores over antisemitism on campus and plagiarism
    in her scholarship (which she contested).
