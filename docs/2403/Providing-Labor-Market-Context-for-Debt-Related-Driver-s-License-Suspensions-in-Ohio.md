# Providing Labor Market Context for Debt-Related Driver’s License Suspensions in Ohio

## Introduction

Most driver’s license suspensions in Ohio do not stem from reasons relating to being a bad driver. In fact, over 60 percent of Ohio’s driver’s license suspensions arise because the driver owes a debt that has not been paid. We label these debt-related suspensions (DRS).

According to a report by the Legal Aid Society of Cleveland, in an average year, over 1.7 million Ohio drivers have over 3.2 million active debt-related suspensions, indicating that drivers often face more than one DRS at a time. While DRS are over-represented in Ohio’s central cities, DRS are a problem throughout the state—60 percent of all suspensions are on drivers *outside* of Ohio’s central cities. The financial implications of DRS are substantial. From 2016 through 2020, the Ohio Bureau of Motor Vehicles (BMV) and third-party creditors levied an average of about $150 million in charges and fees related to DRS, but drivers only paid about $33 million per year during that period. The unpaid amount accumulates over time, averaging about $922 million during those five years. Furthermore, DRS are much more frequently found in high poverty and minority communities.

Individuals with a DRS are not legally allowed to drive anywhere, even to work. This could prevent people from getting to the place where they could make the money needed to repay the debt and have their license reinstated. It also could prevent them from getting a new job that requires a driver’s license.

In this report, we investigate whether DRS has implications for Ohio’s labor force. However, accurately estimating those implications is quite difficult based upon the available data. Instead, we provide labor market context for DRS on two dimensions. First, we use two hypothetical scenarios based on the share of people in the labor force that comply with DRS or not to illustrate risks of DRS. Second, we investigate how often a valid driver’s license is requested by employers in online job postings.

### Key findings:

*   DRS have the potential to significantly impact Ohio’s labor force. For example, if just half of those with a DRS were to comply, the impact statewide could result in a potential loss of over 830,000 working or work-seeking individuals from the labor force.
*   The share of jobs ads requesting a driver’s license in Ohio (14.0 percent) is higher than the national average (10.6 percent) in 2022 and has increased 10 percent faster than the national average from 2015 to 2022.
*   The share of job ads requesting a driver’s license varies significantly by industry and by geography, indicating that some portions of Ohio’s economy have the potential to be more impacted by DRS than others. For instance, the percent of jobs requiring a driver’s license increases as you move from core urban areas to the metropolitan fringe and is highest in nonmetropolitan Ohio.
*   Lower- and middle-wage occupations tend to have the highest rates of job ads requesting a driver’s license. This indicates that DRS can be more problematic for hiring into middle- and lower-wage occupations and suggests that a driver’s license is important for one’s economic mobility in the lower half of the wage distribution.

## Data

The DRS data were obtained via a public records request to the Ohio BMV. We obtained a count of all driver’s license suspensions, as well as detailed financial information about eight types of suspensions that we determined to be debt related. The data were aggregated and provided at the zip code level for the years 2016–2020\. To analyze the DRS data relative to Ohio population, demographic, and employment data, we matched the DRS zip codes to the Census Bureau equivalent: Zip Code Tabulation Areas (ZCTAs).

In addition, this analysis uses data on Ohio’s labor force, industrial composition, and occupations from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Information on Ohio’s job ads comes from Lightcast and is aggregated to produce annual estimates of the share of job ads asking for a driver’s license.

### Two Hypothetical Labor Force Scenarios

Resulting in over 1.7 million licenses suspended annually, DRS have the potential to significantly impact Ohio’s labor force. However, the available data is lacking a few key inputs to precisely estimate those impacts. At the most basic level, for those receiving a DRS, we do not know if they were employed, if they were looking for work, how likely they were to disregard the suspension and keep driving, if they could get to work without driving, and the length of suspension. Given these limitations, we use labor market information to conduct two hypothetical scenarios to illustrate the risks of DRS to Ohio’s labor force. Each scenario is based on upon the share of the labor force that is subject to a binding DRS shock, in which they abide by the suspension and cannot get to or look for work, so they end up leaving the labor force. As mentioned above, we do not know how likely someone is to abide by the suspension and not drive, so we present a scenario in which half of those receiving a DRS comply with the suspension and another scenario in which all of those receiving a DRS comply with the suspension.

To help introduce these scenarios, let us first consider the share of the labor force that is at risk of a DRS in this framework. In 2020, the 1.66 million DRS would equate to 28.9 percent of Ohio’s labor force at risk of receiving a DRS (Table 1). Accordingly, it is probably best to consider the estimates in Table 1 and the two scenario tables (Tables 2 & 3) to be upper bounds for percent of labor force at risk as it is possible that not all those with a DRS are in the labor force or require driving to the workplace. Relatedly, while each scenario as presented refers to the potential labor force declines from a binding DRS, one could just as easily examine potential gains from removing a hypothetical binding DRS policy that is keeping 1.66 million Ohioans out of the labor force. Furthermore, the labor force impacts are more likely to touch those in poor and nonwhite communities as they are more likely to have received a DRS.

#### Table 1: Ohio's Labor Force at Potential Risk of DRS

| 2020 | 5,752,792 |
| # at risk of DSR | 1,660,000 |
| % at risk of DSR | 28.9% |
| 2020 – Rate | 61.6%  |

In the first scenario, half of the DRS are binding, which means that half of those receiving a DRS comply with the suspension, and they end up leaving the labor force because they are unable to get to or look for work without a driver’s license. In this scenario, 830,000 workers (14.4 percent) end up leaving the labor force, effectively lowering the labor force participation rate by almost 9 percentage points, from 61.6 percent to 52.7 percent (Table 2). Based upon these numbers, there are potentially significant labor force impacts if only half of those receiving a DRS comply with the suspension.

#### Table 2: Scenario 1: Labor Force Impacts if Half with DRS Leave the Labor Force

| 2020 | 5,752,792 |
| # leaving LF due to DSR | 830,000 |
| % leaving LF due to DSR | 14.4% |
| 2020 – Rate | 61.6% |
| Estimated Rate | 52.7% |

In the more severe second scenario, all those receiving a DRS comply with the suspension. Under this scenario, almost a third of the labor force is impacted by a DRS and leave the labor force, lowering the labor force participation rate by 18 percentage points to 43.7 percent (Table 3). The potential impacts from this scenario would cause a significant slowdown in economic activity as roughly only two out of every five working age Ohioans would be in the labor force.

#### Table 3: Scenario 2: Potential Impacts if All with DRS Leave the Labor Force

| 2020 | 5,742,446 |
| # leaving LF due to DSR | 1,660,000 |
| % leaving LF due to DSR | 28.9% |
| 2020 – Rate | 61.6% |
| Estimated Rate | 43.7% |

Because DRS are not evenly distributed throughout the state, neither would be the withdrawals from the labor force due to DRS. Figure 1 shows the geographic implications of Scenario 1 where half of all individuals with a DRS would leave the labor force.
