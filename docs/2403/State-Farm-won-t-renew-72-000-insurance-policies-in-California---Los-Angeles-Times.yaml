    “takes seriously our responsibility to maintain adequate claims-paying capacity
    for our customers and to comply with applicable financial solvency laws. It is
    necessary to take these actions now.”

    accountable for their words and deeds,” said Deputy Insurance Commissioner Michael
    Soller. “State Farm General’s decision today raises serious questions about its
    financial situation — questions the company must answer to regulators.”

    are finding it extremely difficult to insure their homes and commercial properties
    as companies increase rates, limit coverage or stop offering policies in areas
    increasingly susceptible to natural disasters.

    from the FAIR Plan as a last resort. Funded by the insurers doing business in
    California, the Fair Access to Insurance Requirement plan provides more limited
    coverage as a fallback for property owners unable to find conventional policies
    they can afford.

    Victoria Roach, president of the FAIR Plan Assn., warned lawmakers that the insurer
    of last resort had a surplus of only $200 million and was at risk of financial
    instability should a catastrophic event occur.

    in February,” Roach [told lawmakers](https://www.assembly.ca.gov/media/assembly-insurance-committee-20240313).
    “So the numbers just continue to climb, which is a concern — as those numbers
    climb, our financial stability comes more in question and we come closer to an
    assessment of the market should we, knock on wood, have a catastrophe.”

- en: In response to the crisis, Insurance Commissioner Ricardo Lara has proposed
    a set of new rules that would allow insurers to raise rates to cover reinsurance
    costs and projected losses from catastrophic fires, but also require that they
    provide coverage for more homes in the canyons and hills. The proposals, which
    aim to move people off the FAIR plan and slow the increase in premiums, have won
    support from insurance industry trade groups and some consumer groups, but criticism
    from other consumer advocates such as [Consumer Watchdog.](https://consumerwatchdog.org/insurance/as-drafted-insurance-commissioners-proposed-rules-for-insurance-catastrophe-models-preserve-secrecy-of-black-box-models/)

    policymakers to pursue the reforms in order to establish “an environment in which
    insurance rates are better aligned with risk.”

    push forward the new regulations at a much faster rate to prevent companies from
    leaving the state.

    submit their new plans based on new rates and get them approved, and then they
    have to program them in their systems, then they have to roll it out to their
    clients and then they have to wait a year to get premiums based on those rates,”
    he said. “We’re talking about a long runway before these regulations will start
    having an impact.”
