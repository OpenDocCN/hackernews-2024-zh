    a set of new rules that would allow insurers to raise rates to cover reinsurance
    costs and projected losses from catastrophic fires, but also require that they
    provide coverage for more homes in the canyons and hills. The proposals, which
    aim to move people off the FAIR plan and slow the increase in premiums, have won
    support from insurance industry trade groups and some consumer groups, but criticism
    from other consumer advocates such as [Consumer Watchdog.](https://consumerwatchdog.org/insurance/as-drafted-insurance-commissioners-proposed-rules-for-insurance-catastrophe-models-preserve-secrecy-of-black-box-models/)
