- en: One of Rust's often mentioned pain points is slow compile times. In order to
    have nice things like the borrow checker, safety, and zero cost abstractions,
    we pay in time spent compiling. Web developers, especially those that come from
    one of the Javascript frameworks, really, really like fast reload times. I was
    fairly active in the Remix discord early on, and the number of people who asked
    about HMR(Hot Module Reloading) [was insane](https://github.com/remix-run/remix/discussions/2384).
    Hot Module Reloading is when the web framework will replaces javascript, html,
    and css modules in an existing page as they are changed without losing page state.
    The alternative, Live Page Reloading, will trigger a page reload when a change
    is detected. For Remix, the time difference between the two is signifigantly less
    than it would be in Rust, where we'd have to recompile.

    higher in order to possibly reduce dev compile times and improve performance.
    By default, the Rust compiler sets an opt-level of 0 for development builds. We're
    going to give it an opt-level of 1 for our code, and an opt-level of 3 for all
    the dependencies of our code.

    follows a few basic steps. It reads in source code, which is converted to a variety
    of types of IR(Intermediate Representation), and optimizations are performed during
    that conversion. Then that IR is fed to a code generator, provided by LLVM, which
    converts the IR into object files, and then the linker links together those object
    files and other system libs into one executable binary. Way more details about
    how that works can be found [here](https://rustc-dev-guide.rust-lang.org/overview.html).
    Fascinating reading, but a bit too deep for our discussion here.

    clean compile times of O3, without decreasing compile times more than mold alone.

- en: Let's enable all the things! The incremental compiles are faster than any of
    the previously tested options, but the clean compiles are still suffering a penalty
    from O3\. Cranelift seems to reduce the penalty from O3, but time will tell whether
    it is better than Mold + Cranelift alone. I suspect this is because Cranelift
    optimizes less than llvm, which is in line with their documentation.

- en: Adding further support to the Cranelift optimization hypothesis, we see similiar
    performance in the clean compilation, but slower performance in incremental without
    Mold enabled. It is interesting that this ran faster than the previous test with
    Mold enabled, although I am not sure the difference is signifigant. Perhaps Mold
    and Cranelift or Mold and O3 have some negative interaction I don't recognize.

- en: Here's the big money, Cranelift and Mold together. This offered the fastest
    clean compilation times, with a roughly 25% reduction, and incremental, sitting
    pretty at around 75% reduction. Interestingly enough, there seemed to be little
    difference between the NVME and the 7200RPM drives here, suggesting that these
    two might be better at using disk I/O than some of the other configurations.

- en: For Rust web frameworks, we can try to simulate the performance of HMR, but
    we won't be able to substitute JS modules. Our attempt to do this is in cargo-leptos,
    and can be used with the `--hot-reload` flag. It will attempt to send html and
    css patches to the browser over a web socket connection when a change inside a
    `view` macro is detected that does not involve a change to a rust code block,
    and compile in the background. For me it works fairly well.

- en: I didn't try to instrument and test it, as hot reload times are nearly instant.
    Any changes to the rust code will require a incremental recompilation though,
    which is why it's so useful to improve that time. JS frameworks will probably
    have an edge there for the foreseeable future.

- en: Enabling Mold and Cranelift netted me a 75% incremental and 25% clean compilation
    time reduction, which is quite signifigant. Using Cranelift requires nightly,
    or setting it up outside rustup, which some projects might find undesirable. Since
    Mold requires Linux, and Sold requires Mac(and paying), for me this further increases
    the argument that Rust web development should be done on some for of Linux or
    Mac, and not on Windows. WSL2 may help improve things, but may [be slower](https://medium.com/for-linux-users/wsl-2-why-you-should-use-real-linux-instead-4ee14364c18).
    Since I have a Mac laptop and a Linux workstation, I will be buying Sold for my
    Mac and using Cranelift for my projects that can.
