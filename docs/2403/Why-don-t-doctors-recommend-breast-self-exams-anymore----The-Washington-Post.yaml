- en: In 2009, the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) officially
    recommended against teaching breast self-exams — a practice that had been widely
    touted in public health campaigns for years before the guidelines. Those decades-old
    campaigns are ingrained into many of our memories. I recall cards in the locker
    rooms at the gym growing up that instructed women on breast self-exam technique.

    randomized to a breast self-exam educational program, but there was evidence of
    harm. That is, patients who were randomly assigned to do breast self-exams were
    significantly more likely to undergo invasive breast biopsies for benign lesions.

    the economic sense, but also to the psychological well-being of the patient. The
    2003 study did note that malignant as well as benign tumors were found more often
    among those in the self-exam group, but that didn’t affect mortality.

    looking for it during a regular self-exam) or finding it by accident (when you’re
    showering or getting dressed) has the same result in terms of your chances for
    surviving the cancer.

    there were no large screening mammography programs like in the U.S. Here, we *do*
    recommend screening mammography for women every two years starting at age 40\.
    (This advice is recent; previously [the recommendation](https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2023/05/09/mammogram-age-40-breast-cancer-screening/?itid=lk_inline_manual_19)
    was to start at 50.) Unlike breast self-exams, mammography has been shown to reduce
    mortality [in multiple randomized control trials](https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/draft-recommendation/breast-cancer-screening-adults#bootstrap-panel--8)

    cases that occur before the age of 40\. Overall, the incidence of breast cancer
    in women younger than 40 is low — about [25 cases per 100,000 women](https://seer.cancer.gov/statistics-network/explorer/application.html?site=55&data_type=1&graph_type=2&compareBy=sex&chk_sex_3=3&rate_type=2&race=1&age_range=122&stage=101&advopt_precision=1&advopt_show_ci=on&hdn_view=1&advopt_show_apc=on&advopt_display=1)
    in 2019\. By comparison, there were about 229 cases per 100,000 women in the 40-to-64-year-old
    age group and 462 per 100,000 in women 65 to 74.
