- en: In early 1982, the Lisa software team was trying to buckle down for the big
    push to ship the software within the next six months. Some of the managers decided
    that it would be a good idea to track the progress of each individual engineer
    in terms of the amount of code that they wrote from week to week. They devised
    a form that each engineer was required to submit every Friday, which included
    a field for the number of lines of code that were written that week.

- en: Bill Atkinson, the author of Quickdraw and the main user interface designer,
    who was by far the most important Lisa implementer, thought that lines of code
    was a silly measure of software productivity. He thought his goal was to write
    as small and fast a program as possible, and that the lines of code metric only
    encouraged writing sloppy, bloated, broken code.

    and had completely rewritten the region engine using a simpler, more general algorithm
    which, after some tweaking, made region operations almost six times faster. As
    a by-product, the rewrite also saved around 2,000 lines of code.

    to fill out the management form for the first time. When he got to the lines of
    code part, he thought about it for a second, and then wrote in the number: -2000.'

    more weeks, they stopped asking Bill to fill out the form, and he gladly complied.
