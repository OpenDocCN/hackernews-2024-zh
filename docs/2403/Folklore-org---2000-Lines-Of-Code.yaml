- en: In early 1982, the Lisa software team was trying to buckle down for the big
    push to ship the software within the next six months. Some of the managers decided
    that it would be a good idea to track the progress of each individual engineer
    in terms of the amount of code that they wrote from week to week. They devised
    a form that each engineer was required to submit every Friday, which included
    a field for the number of lines of code that were written that week.

  zh: 1982 年初，里萨软件团队正努力备战，计划在接下来的六个月内发布软件。一些管理者决定跟踪每位工程师每周编写代码的进展情况，他们设计了一个表格，每位工程师每周五必须提交，其中包括一个填写本周编写代码行数的字段。
- en: Bill Atkinson, the author of Quickdraw and the main user interface designer,
    who was by far the most important Lisa implementer, thought that lines of code
    was a silly measure of software productivity. He thought his goal was to write
    as small and fast a program as possible, and that the lines of code metric only
    encouraged writing sloppy, bloated, broken code.

  zh: 比尔·阿特金森（Bill Atkinson），Quickdraw 的作者和主要用户界面设计师，可以说是里萨（Lisa）的最重要的实施者之一，认为代码行数是衡量软件生产力的一个愚蠢标准。他认为自己的目标是尽可能地编写小巧快速的程序，而代码行数这一指标只会促使编写邋遢、臃肿和有缺陷的代码。
- en: He recently was working on optimizing Quickdraw's region calculation machinery,
    and had completely rewritten the region engine using a simpler, more general algorithm
    which, after some tweaking, made region operations almost six times faster. As
    a by-product, the rewrite also saved around 2,000 lines of code.

  zh: 最近，他正忙于优化 Quickdraw 的区域计算机制，并且完全重写了区域引擎，采用了更简单、更通用的算法，经过一些调整后，使区域操作速度几乎提高了六倍。作为副产品，重写还节省了大约
    2000 行代码。
- en: 'He was just putting the finishing touches on the optimization when it was time
    to fill out the management form for the first time. When he got to the lines of
    code part, he thought about it for a second, and then wrote in the number: -2000.'

  zh: 当他第一次填写管理表格时，他正为优化工作做最后的修整。当到了代码行数部分时，他思考了一会儿，然后填写了一个数字：-2000。
- en: I'm not sure how the managers reacted to that, but I do know that after a couple
    more weeks, they stopped asking Bill to fill out the form, and he gladly complied.
