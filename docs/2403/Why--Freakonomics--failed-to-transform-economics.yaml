    Alfred Marshall’s “Principles of Economics”, a 19th-century textbook that helped
    create the common language economists still use today. Marshall’s contention that
    economics studies the “ordinary” was not a dig, but a statement of intent. The
    discipline was to take seriously some of the most urgent questions in human life.
    How do I pay my bills? What do I do for a living? What happens if I get sick?
    Will I ever be able to retire?

- en: 'In 2003 the *New York Times* published a profile of Steven Levitt, an economist
    at the University of Chicago, in which he expressed a very different perspective:
    “In Levitt’s view,” the article read, “economics is a science with excellent tools
    for gaining answers but a serious shortage of interesting questions.” Mr Levitt
    and the article’s author, Stephen Dubner, would go on to write “Freakonomics”
    together. In their book there was little about the ordinary business of life.
    Through vignettes featuring cheating sumo wrestlers, minimum-wage-earning crack
    dealers and the Ku Klux Klan, a white-supremacist organisation, the authors explored
    how people respond to incentives and how the use of novel data can uncover what
    is really driving their behaviour.'
