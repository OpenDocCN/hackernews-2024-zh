    content, I thought it would be useful to throw some security research tools at
    it and see what kind of issues it might reveal. So today we‚Äôll be using ‚Äú**[Domato](https://github.com/googleprojectzero/domato)**
    [üçÖ](https://github.com/googleprojectzero/domato)‚Äù, a DOM fuzzer from [Google Project
    Zero](https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/), to stress test Ladybird and fix
    some issues found along the way.

    removed from the DOM, its content document is detached from its browsing context.
    However, when getting or setting a property on a window object, we run a spec
    algorithm called **"check if an access between two browsing contexts should be
    reported"** which inspects the browsing context of the ‚Äúaccessor‚Äù and ‚Äúaccessed‚Äù
    window. The spec incorrectly assumed that both windows have an associated browsing
    context at the time of property access.
