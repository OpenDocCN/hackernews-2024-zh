    of jolt that anyone could have thought would bring it down. But when the Dali,
    a ship weighing more than 100,000 tons, smashed into it, the bridge [tumbled](https://www.cnn.com/videos/us/2024/03/28/ntsb-baltimore-francis-scott-key-bridge-damage-ebof-todd-vpx.cnn)

    entirely predictable, bridge collapses as the result of collisions aren’t entirely
    unheard of, and this one may have been avoidable.

    to the American Society of Civil Engineers’ most recent infrastructure [report
    card](https://infrastructurereportcard.org/cat-item/bridges-infrastructure/) released

    built with what are known as redundancies— protections around bridges’ danger
    points.

    above the water, typically made from timber or steel — or “fenders” — structures
    that move objects away from vulnerable points on the bridge to deflect some of
    the force if there is an impact.
