- en: Like many of you, I was disappointed when I learned that Redis® ^(was changing
    to [a non-free licensing model](https://github.com/redis/redis/pull/13157). This
    is a betrayal of the free software community, but perhaps not an entirely surprising
    one. Forks are likely to start appearing in the coming days, and today, I would
    like to offer [Redict](/) to you as a possible future home for your needs, and
    present its trade-offs as compared to the other forks you’re likely to be choosing
    from soon.)

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The choice of the LGPL as the license for Redict is a deliberate one which balances
    a number of concerns. Most importantly, it is an irrevocable promise that Redict
    will always be free, much stronger than the [promise made by RedisLabs Co-founder
    and ex-CEO Yiftach in 2018](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=17819392). By
    using a copyleft license, all changes to Redict are required to be distributed
    using the same LGPL free software license, guaranteeing that modified versions
    of the software will be free.

- en: Additionally, we will not be making use of any sort of Contributor License Agreement
    which gives one entity special privileges with respect to the copyright and licensing
    of Redict in a manner similar to that employed by Redis®. As a consequence, the
    copyright over Redict is held in common by all contributors, who would all have
    to agree to a future change of license, making it next to impossible that a similar
    change of license is in Redict’s future. The provenance of contributions is verified
    with the [Developer Certificate of Origin](https://developercertificate.org/).

- en: There are many copyleft licenses and LGPL was chosen as the most suitable for
    Redict. The Affero GNU General Public License (AGPL) is a common choice for projects
    of this nature, particularly those run by stewards who, like Redis® Ltd, would
    prefer that cloud providers do not sell their software. The AGPL is a fine license,
    but we want to make it as easy as possible for users to comply with the Redict
    license and we do not see any reason to discourage cloud providers from making
    use of Redict. EUPL was considered, but was not selected for the same reasons.

- en: Good question! Redis® OSS was based on the BSD 3-Clause license, which is a
    permissive license and allows for sublicensing provided that its terms are met.
    Redict complies with these terms by retaining the original license and copyright
    disclaimer. All changes made by Redict are licensed using the LGPL and the combined
    work as a whole is distributed under the terms of the LGPL. The licensing situation
    is clearly indicated in the repository by making use of the [REUSE](https://reuse.software)
    specification.

    they do own the trademark on the name). They're sublicensing it using the same
    permissive BSD license that everyone else gets, same as Redict, only they're using
    the non-free SSPL whereas we're using the free LGPL.</details>
