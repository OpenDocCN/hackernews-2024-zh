- en: Charge Robotics is a YC-backed startup building robots that build large-scale
    solar farms. Demand for new solar projects is booming (1/5th of all the solar
    that exists in the US was installed last year!), but today‚Äôs construction companies
    can‚Äôt keep up due to limited labor resources.

    this bottleneck and speed up the world‚Äôs transition to renewables.
