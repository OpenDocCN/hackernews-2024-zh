    that run on fuel oil, such as Maine, according to the study. (Maine seems to be
    one step ahead of the researchers: Heat pumps have proven so popular there that

    heat pumps can generate emissions in the same way standard ACs do: by leaking
    refrigerant, the chemicals that enable these appliances to move around heat. Though
    it’s being [phased down](https://www.epa.gov/climate-hfcs-reduction/frequent-questions-phasedown-hydrofluorocarbons#:~:text=The%20American%20Innovation%20and%20Manufacturing%20Act,minimizing%20releases%20of%20HFCs%20from%20equipment.),
    the HVAC standard refrigerant R-410A is [2,088 times](https://ww2.arb.ca.gov/resources/documents/high-gwp-refrigerants)
    more potent a greenhouse gas than CO[2], so even small leaks have an outsize impact.'

    given the emissions heat pumps avoid, the NREL team found. Typical leakage rates
    of R-410A increase emissions on average by only 0.07 metric tons of CO[2] equivalent
    per year, shaving the overall savings of 2.5 metric tons by just 3 percent, Wilson
    said.

- en: A [2023 analysis](https://rmi.org/now-is-the-time-to-go-all-in-on-heat-pumps/)
    from climate think tank RMI further backs up heat pumps’ climate bona fides. Across
    the 48 continental states, RMI found that replacing a gas furnace with an efficient
    heat pump saves emissions not only cumulatively across the appliance’s lifetime,
    but also in the very first year it’s installed. RMI estimated that emissions prevented
    in that first year were 13% to 72% relative to gas-furnace emissions, depending
    on the state. (Canary Media is an independent affiliate of RMI.)

    weather, pull heat from the outdoor air and can be three to four times as efficient
    as gas furnaces. But ground-source heat pumps can be more than five times as efficient
    compared to gas furnaces — and thus unlock even greater greenhouse-gas reductions,
    according to RMI.

    For a high-level estimate, NREL put out [an interactive dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/nrel.buildingstock/viz/Heatpumpsforall-GHGemissions/Coverpage).
    In the ​“states” tab, you can filter down to your state, building type and heating
    fuel. For instance, based on a scenario of moderate grid decarbonization in my
    state of Colorado, a single-family home that swaps out a gas furnace for a heat
    pump could slash emissions by a whopping 6 metric tons of CO[2].

    electric-resistance heating were to swap it right now for heat-pump heating, the
    emissions of the entire U.S. economy would shrink by 5% to 9%. That’s how powerful
    a decarbonizing tool heat pumps are.'
