    an epiphany. Tasked with choosing the day’s soundtrack, she opened [Spotify](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/spotify),
    then flicked and flicked, endlessly searching for something to play. Nothing was
    *perfect* for the moment. She looked some more, through playlist after playlist.
    An uncomfortably familiar loop, it made her realise: she hated how music was being
    used in her life. “That was the problem,” she says. “*Using* music, rather than
    having it be its own experience … What kind of music am I going to use to set
    a mood for the day? What am I going to use to enjoy my walk? I started not really
    liking what that meant.”'

    like a creation of the streaming environment. “I decided that having music be
    this tool to [create] an experience instead of an experience itself was not something
    I was into,” she reflects. So she cut off her Spotify service, and later, [Apple
    Music](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/apple-music) too, to focus on making
    her listening more “home-based” and less of a background experience.
