- en: Hi! I'm a tool to teach you the most popular responses to each chess opening
    and its variations. I'll ask you for the best move, and then I'll make any respectable
    move back. I do this by looking at what many Master (>2200 Elo) chess players
    have played before. I play the most popular moves more often but still like to
    play rarer openings. I'm in active development, and I hope I can help improve
    your chess game!
