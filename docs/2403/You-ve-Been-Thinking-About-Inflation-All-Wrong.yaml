- en: 'With the most recent CPI data coming in at 8.5% over the prior year, there’s
    been a lot of talk online about inflation and it’s impact on your finances. Unfortunately,
    one of the most common arguments made about inflation with respect to your income
    isn’t exactly correct. The argument goes as such:'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If inflation is 8.5% and your employer gives you a raise of *less than* 8.5%,
    then you are worse off in purchasing power terms than last year.
  prefs:
  - PREF_BQ
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: On its face this argument makes logic sense. If prices increase by 8.5%, then
    your pay has to go up by 8.5% in order to be the same off, right? Well, not exactly.
    There are two major problems with this argument.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: First, this argument assumes that your inflation rate is the same as the inflation
    rate calculated in the CPI index. But, we know that this probably isn’t true.
    Since everyone consumes different things in different quantities, we all have
    our own personal inflation rates. For example, since I don’t own a car, higher
    gasoline prices impact me less than someone who commutes to work everyday. But
    let’s put this argument aside for now and *assume that your personal rate of inflation
    matches the CPI data.*

- en: Second, the logic above assumes that your pay is identical to your spending.
    If your pay is above your rate of spending (i.e. you are a saver), then you can
    get by with a raise *less than* inflation and be the same off. Let me illustrate
    with an example.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Let’s assume that you are being paid $100,000 a year after taxes and you spend
    $50,000 of it. Well, if inflation hits 10% over the next year, your basket of
    goods will now cost $55,000 (i.e. $5,000 more) to purchase. How much does your
    $100,000 salary have to go up to offset this? 10%? Nope. It only takes 5% (i.e.
    $5,000) for you to break even. This is half the rate of inflation.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This simple example demonstrates why a X% increase in inflation does *not* need
    to be met with an X% increase in pay if you are a saver. In fact, using the example
    above, any raise greater than 5% makes you better off in a world with 10% inflation.
    Why? Because the first 5% is required to keep your consumption constant (i.e.
    the additional $5,000) and anything above that is pure upside.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Ultimately, what matters when it comes to inflation and your raise is your spending
    *relative to your income*, a.k.a. your savings rate. If your income after-taxes
    perfectly matches your spending (i.e. you don’t save any money), then, yes, you
    would need an inflation-sized raise to be the same off over time. However, if
    you are a saver, then your income can rise by some amount *less than* inflation
    and you would be unaffected by it.

    to offset inflation with this simple formula:'

    a raise equal to inflation.

- en: More importantly, this formula leads us to an unfortunate conclusion—inflation
    has a larger impact on those with lower savings rates. And since we know empirically
    that those with lower savings rates are typically those with lower incomes (see
    ch.3 of [Just Keep Buying](https://amzn.to/36rDz39)), this means that inflation
    is disproportionally harmful to the poor.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But what makes this result even worse is that the poor tend to not own any income-producing
    assets either. These income-producing assets (such as stocks and real estate)
    [tend to rise during periods of high inflation](https://ofdollarsanddata.com/how-to-invest-your-money-when-inflation-is-high/),
    but those with little wealth don’t see these benefits. Therefore, not only are
    the poor affected by inflation through their incomes, but also through their lack
    of wealth. It’s a double whammy that those with higher incomes and higher wealth
    mostly get to ignore.

    future changes in prices (i.e. you have a bigger buffer against future inflation).
    And by owning income-producing assets such as stocks, farmland, and real estate,
    your wealth should keep pace with inflation (to some degree) over the long-run.

    extremely frugal investor. While I have been critical of extreme frugality on
    this blog, when it comes to fighting inflation, these people are unmatched. Why?
    Because they spend less money on an absolute and relative basis! And because they
    spend less money, they have to worry less about inflation than those who spend
    more.

- en: Of course, I am not advocating that you start re-using your dental floss or
    making your dish soap at home, but if inflation worries you that much, spending
    less is your best option, especially in the short run. In the long run, I recommend
    growing your income and buying income-producing assets that will rise with prices
    over time.
