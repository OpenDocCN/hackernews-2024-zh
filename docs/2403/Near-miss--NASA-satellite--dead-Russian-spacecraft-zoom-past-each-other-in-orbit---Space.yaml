    spy satellite Cosmos 2221 zoomed uncomfortably close to a NASA craft dubbed TIMED
    that has been studying [Earth's atmosphere](https://www.space.com/17683-earth-atmosphere.html)
    since 2001.

    will approach each other again, this was their closest pass in the current predicted
    orbit determinations, as they are gradually moving apart in altitude," NASA officials
    wrote in an [update today](https://blogs.nasa.gov/sunspot/2024/02/28/nasas-timed-spacecraft-passes-safely-by-satellite/).'

    company [LeoLabs gave us the numbers](https://twitter.com/LeoLabs_Space/status/1762851748702511418),
    and they are sobering. The two spacecraft, which are orbiting at an altitude of
    about 378 miles (608 kilometers), missed each other by less than 65 feet (20 meters).

    there are about 11,500 satellites zooming around Earth at the moment, yet only
    9,000 of them remain operational. But that''s just the tip of the orbital iceberg.
    About 36,500 pieces of debris at least 4 inches (10 centimeters) wide cruise around
    our planet, as do more than 130 million others with a diameter of 1 millimeter
    or more.'

    fast things move in Earth orbit. For example, 250 miles (400 km) up — the average
    altitude of the [International Space Station](https://www.space.com/16748-international-space-station.html)
    — objects are zipping along at about 17,500 mph (28,160 kph).

    the influence of [the sun](https://www.space.com/58-the-sun-formation-facts-and-characteristics.html)
    and of human activity on Earth's mesosphere and lower thermosphere/ionosphere,"
    NASA officials wrote in today's update. "The region is a gateway between Earth
    and space, where the sun's energy is first deposited into Earth's environment."

    [according to NASA](https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/spacecraft/display.action?id=1992-080A).
    The 4,400-pound (2,000 kilograms) spacecraft launched in November 1992.
