    is not tied to any one device or location. **As long as you have access to a web
    browser, you have access to your machines.**

    and a desktop operating system hosted in the cloud, you can combine the convenience
    of Guacamole with the resilience and flexibility of cloud computing.

    documented](/api-documentation/), including basic tutorials and conceptual overviews
    in the [online manual](/doc/gug/). These APIs allow Guacamole to be tightly integrated
    into other applications, whether they be open source or proprietary.
