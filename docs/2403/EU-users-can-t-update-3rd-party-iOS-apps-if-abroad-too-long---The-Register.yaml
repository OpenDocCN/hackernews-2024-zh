    rules for third-party iOS app stores a pain for any user or developer that wants
    to take advantage of them.

- en: Hot on the heels of Apple [releasing iOS 17.4](https://www.theregister.com/2024/03/06/ios_17_4_eu_compliance/)
    to comply with the European Union's Digital Markets Act rules (which force it
    to give users greater control over their devices), Apple has published a [help
    page](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/118110) describing not only how it intends
    to track EU users eligible for the new permissions, but also how it'll shut down
    access for Europeans spending too much time outside the bloc.

- en: Along with obviously needing an Apple ID registered in an eligible EU nation
    (listed on the help page), Apple will use on-device processing to collect "an
    indicator of eligibility" that's transmitted to Apple. That indicator will need
    to include determining where the device is located, but Apple said it won't actually
    collect device location.

- en: EU residents who leave the continent for short-term travel won't notice any
    effect, and will continue to have access to what Apple calls "alternative app
    marketplaces" and the apps installed from said markets. However, "If you're gone
    for too long, you'll lose access to some features, including installing new alternative
    app marketplaces," Apple said.

- en: It's not clear how long the grace period is, or when Apple will disable alternative
    app marketplaces for EU residents traveling abroad. It's also not clear how often
    Apple collects indicators of eligibility, or what other features may be disabled
    (eg, [non-WebKit browser engines](https://www.theregister.com/2024/01/25/apple_eu_dma/).)
    We've asked Apple for a statement, but haven't heard back.

- en: As for what alternative app marketplace users stand to lose if they spend too
    much time abroad, Apple doesn't mention deleting app marketplaces or their apps,
    but does say that "they can't be updated by the marketplace you downloaded them
    from."

- en: '"If not properly managed, alternative app marketplaces pose increased privacy,
    safety and security risks for users and developers," Apple noted, taking the same
    line it''s been pushing since it announced moves to comply with the DMA. Ironically
    enough, Apple made that statement on its help page right after saying it wouldn''t
    allow EU residents to update apps from alternative marketplaces, leaving users
    vulnerable to the very issues it said would arise from complying with the DMA.'
