    of the housing problems that plague cities in the West. Mumbai is the wealthiest
    city in India. It contributes over 6% of India’s economy, 30% of its income tax,
    40% of its trade, and 60% of its customs duties. Its per capita GDP in 2015 stood
    at $5,328, more than 3.3 times that of the country as a whole. And yet, half of

    is due to the relative poverty (compared to the first world) and extreme population
    density of the city. Some of the issue is geography. Mumbai sits on a peninsula;
    business and industry are concentrated at the tip, forcing its population ever
    farther northward. But a large part of the housing crisis can be attributed to
    draconian restrictions on housing — both new and old. And it’s not just those
    trying to make a living in Mumbai who suffer from these policies — they stifle
    growth in India’s economic and financial center.

    buildings. In New York, “setback” rules govern the amount of light that reaches
    a city street. This incentivizes developers to design buildings that taper as
    they grow in height — famously giving rise to the wedding-cake-style skyscraper
    and the iconic shapes of the Chrysler and Empire State Buildings. The 130-foot
    height restriction in Washington, D.C. — meant to highlight the Capitol and Washington
    Monument — has shaped the city’s blocky urban form. Amsterdam’s famously narrow
    homes are largely the result of a medieval Dutch tax regime that levied taxes
    based on the width of a house’s frontage.

- en: Mumbai primarily controls building height via floor area ratios (FAR), a formula
    which pegs the total allowed floor space of a building to the size of the lot
    it’s on. An FAR limit of 1 means that a building on a lot of 4,000 square feet
    may have, at most, 4,000 square feet of internal floor space. In the absence of
    other restrictions, the builder could build a one-story building on the whole
    plot, a two-story building on half the plot, or, to take it to an extreme, a one-story
    building on half the plot with a 2,000-story extension on a single square foot
    of plot space. Unlike maximum height restrictions as in D.C., FAR allows for a
    greater variety of urban forms. But Mumbai’s FAR stands far below that of other
    large cities, despite the fact that it is, by some measures, the second most densely
    populated city in the world.

    residential plots and 5 for commercial plots, but only along major thoroughfares.
    Because most roads in Mumbai are narrow, a majority of buildings receive much
    lower FAR allowances. Experts estimate that almost half of the city’s roads are
    between 9.2 and 13.4 meters wide. This would mean that the buildings adjoining
    these roads will have a maximum [allowable](https://www.godbolemukadam.com/pdfs/mumbai/MUBAI-DCPR.pdf)
    FAR of between 2 and 2.4. General FAR ceilings are built with innumerable loopholes
    and possible circumventions in mind. But these exceptions are likely to only marginally
    increase FAR, and only then for developers with the ability to navigate the red
    tape to access them.

    Tokyo’s central business district goes up to 20\. Singapore allows a maximum of

    in different neighborhoods; the Mission Special District, for instance, goes up
    to 9\. Hong Kong, a city with its own history of slums, has a top FAR of 10\.
    Dhaka, Bangladesh, maintained a top FAR of over 9 until last year, although this
    seems to have been reduced significantly in the latest development plan. The American
    Planning Association reports historical FARs in Chicago with allowances for commercial
    districts ranging from 1.2 to 16, and .5 to 10 for residential zones. Since Chicago’s
    population density is 17% that of Mumbai’s, residents in its lowest-FAR zones
    still have more floor space per capita than those in Mumbai’s highest.

    High population density within a square kilometer allows for increased agglomeration
    effects — the economic benefits that come when a large and diverse labor market
    is located close together. In poor countries, doubling a city population leads
    to somewhere between a 2% and 10% increase in per capita GDP. But high population

    Although Mumbai’s official density is similar to that of Manhattan, its living
    conditions are worlds apart. Houses in Dharavi, the city’s largest slum, generally
    do not come with attached toilets; residents often use open sewers or waterways

    at nominal levels set almost 60 years prior. The law was finally superseded by
    the Maharashtra Rent Control Act, which set rent control for the entire state.
    The [new act](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=926512) set
    rents at the standard rent fixed by courts under prior rent acts plus 5% and allows

    provide adequate incentive for investment. The annual 4% rental increase is below
    Indian inflation since 1999, below current Indian treasury yields, and far below
    the increase in demand or the increase in per capita GDP. At the allowable annual
    increase, the value of rent diminishes sharply over time. If the average Indian
    landlord received 30% of their income in rent in 1999, and received 4% annual
    nominal rent increases, they would be making only 8% of their income from rent
    on those units by 2021\. Even more starkly, the act does not address the lag in
    rents from 1940 to 1999\. A unit rented out under the 1947 rent act would have
    its rent pegged to 1940 prices until 1999, at which point a one-time 5% increase
    would be allowed, and a 4% annual increase thereafter.

    disincentivizing landlords from building, purchasing, and letting units, it has
    all but destroyed the rental market in the city. As rents still cannot track market
    rates, and as this makes it difficult for landlords to accrue adequate returns
    over the long run, virtually all new housing is owner occupied. Between 1961 and
    2011, the number of formal rental units in Mumbai increased by less than 5% while
    the metro population quadrupled. The number of owner-occupied units meanwhile
    increased by 2,500%. While rent control continues to allow older tenants to pay
    next to nothing in rent, it prevents the creation of formal housing stock for
    newer tenants. Even if Mumbai’s FAR restrictions allowed developers to build more
    housing, the lack of rental market dampens the financial incentive to build rental
    units. And given the growth in the city’s population over time, the aggregate
    loss is staggering.

    margin. Nineteenth-century laws governing easements allow for makeshift rental
    agreements that at times have been exempt from rent control. A newer, higher-friction
    workaround is the introduction of a *pagdi* system, in which tenants pay roughly
    80% of the purchase price of property up front, to be returned at the end of their
    lease. And in slums, informal rental agreements abound. But these makeshift solutions
    do not replace the formal rental system fully, as tenants lack formal protections,
    and they may be forced to put up massive amounts of collateral or to accept easement
    contracts of shifting legality. On some level, these workarounds are less proof
    of rent control’s surmountability than an illustration of its costs — if people
    are still willing to enter into rental agreements in informal and unfavorable
    terms, think of how much value the lack of a formal rental market is leaving on
    the table.

    every year. By limiting the effects of agglomeration, the city’s building and
    rental restrictions exert an immense drag on the city’s ability to drive growth
    on the national level. Consider that the price-to-income ratio of Mumbai’s housing
    is more than twice that of Delhi’s, almost three times that of Chennai, and almost
