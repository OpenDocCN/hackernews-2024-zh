    and they’re asking to expand [right-to-repair](https://gizmodo.com/how-a-group-of-train-hackers-exposed-a-right-to-repair-1851128745?rev=1703787932393)
    laws to address the issue. In a letter to the US Copyright Office on Thursday,
    regulators asked for commercial soft-serve machines to be exempt from current
    laws making them difficult to repair. The laws also make it more difficult for
    you to get a McFlurry.

    promote competition in markets for replacement parts, repair, and maintenance
    services,” said the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission in
    a [joint letter](https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/ftc_gov/pdf/ATR-FTC-JointComment.pdf).

- en: The McDonald’s broken ice cream machines have found themselves at the center
    of the right-to-repair movement. The reason [McDonald’s ice cream machines are
    always down](https://gizmodo.com/broken-ice-cream-machines-could-cost-mcdonalds-900-mil-1848619277)
    is because of copyright law. Only technicians licensed by the company that made
    the device are allowed to touch the machines, and they charge over $300 for a
    15-minute servicing, according to the letter. The DOJ and the FTC identified commercial
    soft-serve machines as one of four device categories that would benefit from an
    easing of copyright laws.

    pain in the neck for McDonald’s too. A soft-serve equipment breakdown can lead
    to a single restaurant losing $625 per day. The scarcity of licensed repair technicians
    also means there’s always a long wait time to fix a soft-serve machine.

    allow large manufacturers to dominate markets, leaving small businesses and consumers
    frustrated. Regulators now seem to be paying more attention to these old, glaring
    issues.
