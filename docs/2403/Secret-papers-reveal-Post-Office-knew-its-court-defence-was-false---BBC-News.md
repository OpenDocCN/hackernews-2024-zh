# Secret papers reveal Post Office knew its court defence was false - BBC News

In July 2017, the Post Office filed a defence document as part of the case. It included some findings from Bramble - in some cases word-for-word - while omitting where they came from and other key elements from the draft report.

Despite what is set out in Bramble, this defence document - which is accompanied by a signed statement of truth - stated that it would be "impossible" for Fujitsu to remotely cause "significant shortfalls".

In the defence, the Post Office conceded that a "small number" of Fujitsu employees had user rights to alter transactions but stated users were strictly controlled.

But in Bramble, Deloitte said it was "impossible" to know which Fujitsu staff had this unrestricted access prior to 2015 because there were no records of who they were or what they did.

Mr Green, who acted for the sub-postmasters, said that in his 34 years as a barrister, he had never seen a defendant proceeding with a huge case and "fighting it very aggressively" in circumstances like this.

Although Bramble specifically looked into the sub-postmasters' claims, the draft report's existence was not disclosed to them or to the court.

Bramble was "exactly the sort of thing that we would have wanted to have and to analyse and put in front of the judge", Mr Green said.

He added: "It's them admitting that they could do in 2017 something they were still denying that they could do in 2019."

The branches examined in Bramble by Deloitte belonged to 91 sub-postmasters involved in the Bates case - including people who had been jailed for theft because of shortfalls.

Joan Bailey and her husband ran a village Post Office in Powys - their branch is mentioned in the draft report. Mrs Bailey estimates that the couple paid over £40,000 to the Post Office to cover losses caused by Horizon.

When the BBC showed Mrs Bailey the report, she said she was "very angry". She added: "This document should have been disclosed years ago. It would have saved myself - and also a lot of other people - a lot of grief and heartache."

Following a request by the BBC, Deloitte's Bramble draft report is now [publicly available, external](https://www.postofficehorizoninquiry.org.uk/evidence/pol00028070-deloittes-bramble-draft-report) on the Post Office inquiry website.

In June 2016, Tim Parker, the Post Office's then-chairman, told government ministers he had stopped an investigation into Horizon on legal advice, because of the upcoming court action by postmasters. The existence of that letter from the former chairman was [revealed by the BBC last month](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-68146054).

In it, he said the Post Office would "instead address the issues through equivalent work taken forward in the litigation".

Now, the discovery of the draft Bramble report indicates that the investigation into Horizon, originally ordered by the government, actually continued in secret for more than a year, focusing on the branches involved in the case.

In it, Deloitte reviewed Horizon documents, examined transaction data and interviewed Fujitsu and Post Office staff. The purpose was to find out if Horizon was causing sub-postmasters' financial losses.

Deloitte found that while remote tampering by Fujitsu was possible, it would be "a complex procedure" and "likely a 'programme' would have to be written and performed".

In a table, the draft report detailed hundreds of debited transactions entered by "non-branch users", who the report explained "can access branches remotely for support purposes".

In total these debits amounted to £1.3m and were taken from the accounts of 18 branches run by claimants in the Bates v Post Office case.
