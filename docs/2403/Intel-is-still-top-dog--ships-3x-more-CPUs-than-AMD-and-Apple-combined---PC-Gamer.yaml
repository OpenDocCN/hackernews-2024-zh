    some green shoots have been spotted in terms of recovery in the industry as a
    whole. The GPU market saw a [5.9% rise in GPU shipments](https://www.pcgamer.com/the-pc-market-is-looking-increasingly-healthy-as-gpu-shipments-rise-on-the-back-of-surging-notebook-demand/)
    at the tail end of the year, and, according to some recently released statistics,
    when it comes to the desktop and notebook market it seems like Intel may be leading
    the comeback over its competition in the CPU sector, demonstrating some truly
    dominant leads over its nearest rivals.

    a global technology market analyst firm (via [WCCFTech](https://wccftech.com/intel-global-desktop-notebook-pc-cpu-shipments-50-million-units-3-times-more-amd-apple-combined/#:~:text=HardwareReport-,Intel's%20Global%20Desktop%20%26%20Notebook%20PC%20CPU%20Shipments%20Reached%2050%20Million,Higher%20Than%20AMD%20%26%20Apple%20Combined&text=Q4%202023%20was%20strong%20for,%2C%20far%20exceeding%20AMD%20%26%20Apple.)).
    For the last quarter of 2023, Intel shipped a staggering 50 million CPUs, maintaining
    a market share of a truly gigantic 78% with a 3% year on year growth. That figure
    stands in stark comparison to AMD's eight million shipments and a market share
    of 13%, showing a slight 1% decline in shipments year on year.

    shipped with a 4% decrease in shipments. For those of you that like an overall
    equivalency, that equates to well over three times more desktop and laptop CPUs
    shipped than both of Intel's main competitors in the CPU market combined, quite
    an impressive achievement especially given that AMD in particular has some very
    competitive desktop chips for sale, including the gaming benchmark dominating
    [Ryzen 7 7800X3D](https://www.pcgamer.com/amd-ryzen-7-7800x3d-review-benchmarks-performance/).

    PC notebook sector has been credited as [leading the charge](https://wccftech.com/gpu-market-6-percent-shipment-increase-notebooks-nvidia-amd-flat-intel-gains/)
    in both rising GPU and CPU segments, and while gaming laptops are likely to [account
    for some portion of that rise](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/gaming-laptop-market-reach-us-083000373.html?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAFSP27EXk1qql87Z6EZIOYpKBfammijBTqBokg72JpLFzRJJ8eVYDzd1A8DG_TmYsXBU6qEpLCqb-aePMBBjTyr3MJWNnZnmVh4jXCI9_3lkn52WdRjJhgFZirUda2ydMnb_EiURaJ-BqkcuHmsHVp_GoaVSsHCJp2Mn7yTjh4Il),
    laptop and notebook sales as a whole are said to account for almost 69% of the
    global CPU market.

    before AMD releases some new contenders in the desktop CPU market, in the form
    of its "Granite Ridge" Zen 5 architecture chips, currently tipped to [potentially
    launch between April and June of this year](https://www.pcgamer.com/fresh-amd-zen-5-cpu-details-leak-suggesting-a-likely-launch-date-between-april-and-june-of-this-year/).
    When it comes to the laptop CPUs, the new "Strix Point" Zen 5 mobile chips are
    also [rumoured to be appearing](https://www.notebookcheck.net/Leak-sheds-light-on-AMD-s-Hawk-Point-APU-successors-including-Strix-Point-Sarlak-Kraken-and-Sound-Wave.809357.0.html)
    later this year.

    Arrow Lake desktop CPUs due to replace the current Raptor Lake Refresh generation,
    although with Computex coming up in June and [Intel's Pat Gelsinger set to deliver
    a keynote](https://www.pcgamer.com/hardware/processors/intels-pat-gelsinger-will-deliver-a-keynote-at-computex-2024-introducing-next-generation-client-computing-products-so-maybe-well-finally-get-an-official-look-at-arrow-lake/),
    perhaps we'll get a clearer idea as to when we'll see these two giants go head
    to head in the desktop market with some new silicon, or maybe even a look at some
    new laptop chips in the form of [Lunar Lake](https://www.pcgamer.com/intels-lunar-lake-is-on-track-for-a-2024-appearance-along-with-significant-ipc-gains-in-the-cpu-core-and-three-times-more-ai-performance-from-gpu-and-npu/).

    towards Intel in overall market share, although it still has a long way to go
    before the blue team might start to worry. It remains to be seen whether a new
    generation of chips can swing the market one way or the other, or whether Intel
    will continue to dominate into the future.
