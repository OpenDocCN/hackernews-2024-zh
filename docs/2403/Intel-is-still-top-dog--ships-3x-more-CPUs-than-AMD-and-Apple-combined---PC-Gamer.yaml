- en: While global PC shipments experienced something of a decline for much of 2023,
    some green shoots have been spotted in terms of recovery in the industry as a
    whole. The GPU market saw a [5.9% rise in GPU shipments](https://www.pcgamer.com/the-pc-market-is-looking-increasingly-healthy-as-gpu-shipments-rise-on-the-back-of-surging-notebook-demand/)
    at the tail end of the year, and, according to some recently released statistics,
    when it comes to the desktop and notebook market it seems like Intel may be leading
    the comeback over its competition in the CPU sector, demonstrating some truly
    dominant leads over its nearest rivals.

  zh: 尽管2023年全球PC出货量大部分时间出现下降，但行业整体复苏已有所观察。GPU市场在年底出现了[5.9%的GPU出货增长](https://www.pcgamer.com/the-pc-market-is-looking-increasingly-healthy-as-gpu-shipments-rise-on-the-back-of-surging-notebook-demand/)，根据最近发布的一些统计数据，就台式机和笔记本市场而言，Intel在CPU领域可能领先于竞争对手，展示出在其最近竞争对手面前的真正主导地位。
- en: That's according to the [latest stats from Canalys](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7173194948257808385/),
    a global technology market analyst firm (via [WCCFTech](https://wccftech.com/intel-global-desktop-notebook-pc-cpu-shipments-50-million-units-3-times-more-amd-apple-combined/#:~:text=HardwareReport-,Intel's%20Global%20Desktop%20%26%20Notebook%20PC%20CPU%20Shipments%20Reached%2050%20Million,Higher%20Than%20AMD%20%26%20Apple%20Combined&text=Q4%202023%20was%20strong%20for,%2C%20far%20exceeding%20AMD%20%26%20Apple.)).
    For the last quarter of 2023, Intel shipped a staggering 50 million CPUs, maintaining
    a market share of a truly gigantic 78% with a 3% year on year growth. That figure
    stands in stark comparison to AMD's eight million shipments and a market share
    of 13%, showing a slight 1% decline in shipments year on year.

  zh: 根据全球技术市场分析公司[Canalys的最新数据](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7173194948257808385/)（通过[WCCFTech](https://wccftech.com/intel-global-desktop-notebook-pc-cpu-shipments-50-million-units-3-times-more-amd-apple-combined/#:~:text=HardwareReport-,Intel's%20Global%20Desktop%20%26%20Notebook%20PC%20CPU%20Shipments%20Reached%2050%20Million,Higher%20Than%20AMD%20%26%20Apple%20Combined&text=Q4%202023%20was%20strong%20for,%2C%20far%20exceeding%20AMD%20%26%20Apple.))，2023年第四季度，Intel出货了惊人的5000万个CPU，市场份额保持在真正巨大的78%，同比增长3%。这一数字与AMD的800万出货和13%的市场份额形成鲜明对比，显示年度出货量略微下降了1%。
- en: That's still significantly more than Apple, with a reported six million units
    shipped with a 4% decrease in shipments. For those of you that like an overall
    equivalency, that equates to well over three times more desktop and laptop CPUs
    shipped than both of Intel's main competitors in the CPU market combined, quite
    an impressive achievement especially given that AMD in particular has some very
    competitive desktop chips for sale, including the gaming benchmark dominating
    [Ryzen 7 7800X3D](https://www.pcgamer.com/amd-ryzen-7-7800x3d-review-benchmarks-performance/).

  zh: 这仍然明显多于苹果，据报道出货600万台，出货量减少4%。对于那些喜欢总体对等性的人来说，这相当于台式机和笔记本CPU出货量比Intel两大竞争对手的总和多出三倍以上，这是一个非常令人印象深刻的成就，尤其是考虑到AMD特别是在销售一些非常有竞争力的台式机芯片方面，包括主导游戏基准的[Ryzen
    7 7800X3D](https://www.pcgamer.com/amd-ryzen-7-7800x3d-review-benchmarks-performance/)。
- en: Still, it's not all about PC gaming and desktop chip performance figures. The
    PC notebook sector has been credited as [leading the charge](https://wccftech.com/gpu-market-6-percent-shipment-increase-notebooks-nvidia-amd-flat-intel-gains/)
    in both rising GPU and CPU segments, and while gaming laptops are likely to [account
