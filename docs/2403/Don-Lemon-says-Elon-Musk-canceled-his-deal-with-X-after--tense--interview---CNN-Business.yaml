    hours after the former CNN anchor conducted an interview last week with the erratic
    billionaire for the debut episode of his new independent web-based show.

    took over the social media platform last year, asking him if he believed that
    he and the company had a responsibility to moderate hateful content.

    reason I’m doing this interview is because you’re on the X platform and you asked
    for it. Otherwise, I would not do this interview.”

    Trump. CNN previously [confirmed](https://www.cnn.com/politics/live-news/super-tuesday-primary-03-05-24/h_88bffd92981111323b97006950afa7d9) the

    Musk said, adding that Trump did “most of the talking.”

    and multiple criminal cases playing out in the courts, did not ask him for money.
    Musk said he was “not paying his legal bills in any way shape or form.”

    founder if he believed it posed a problem for his government security clearance.
    Musk, Lemon said, answered no because he has a prescription for the drug.

    with Musk for the first episode of “The Don Lemon Show,” which will be released
    Monday on social media platforms including X and YouTube, was “respectful and
    wide ranging” and that “there were no restrictions on the interview that he willingly
    agreed to.”'

    all ideas can be shared seems not to include questions of him from people like

    his social media Wednesday, Lemon took further aim at Musk’s claim to be a “free
    speech absolutist.”

    at times, I thought it was good for people to see our exchange,” Lemon said. “But
    apparently free speech absolutism doesn’t apply when it comes to questions about
    him from people like me.”

    Musk was miffed when Lemon questioned him on his use of the drug ketamine, his
    government security clearance, and the issue of antisemitism.

    as we believe in providing a platform for creators to scale their work and connect
    with new communities,” the company said in a statement. “However, like any enterprise,
    we reserve the right to make decisions about our business partnerships, and after
    careful consideration, X decided not to enter into a commercial partnership with
    the show.”

    which is not involved in Lemon’s new venture.

    as evidenced by the fact that CNN is dying,” Musk wrote. “And, instead of it being
    the real Don Lemon, it was really just [former CNN chief] Jeff Zucker talking
    through Don, so lacked authenticity.”

    to honor the financial terms of the agreement.

    matter told CNN. But contracts do not necessarily have to be signed to be legally
    binding, particularly if it is clear each side had arrived at a mutual understanding.
    And according to the people close to the matter, Lemon’s camp is confident that
    a deal had effectively been struck, as evidenced by the fact that X had touted
    the deal in public announcements earlier this year. Moreover, Musk himself appeared
    to acknowledge that there had been a deal, texting Jay Sures, the UTA power agent
    who represents Lemon, “contract is canceled,” according to people familiar with
    the matter.

    writing last year on X: “It’d be great to have [MSNBC host] Rachel Maddow, Don
    Lemon & others on the left put their shows on this platform. No exclusivity or
    legal docs required! You will receive our full support. The digital town square
    is for all.”'

    your show on this platform? Maybe worth a try. Audience is much bigger.”'

    taken steps to limit the speech of critics. The billionaire has at times suspended
    journalists from his platform and filed lawsuits against watchdogs for publishing
    reports critical of X.

    organizations, he has simultaneously elevated conspiracy theories and extremist

    said left him “stunned.” No specific reason was given by CNN for Lemon’s dismissal,
    but it came after he was widely criticized for making sexist comments about then-GOP
    presidential candidate Nikki Haley. Lemon apologized for the remarks at the time,
    saying, “When I make a mistake, I own it. And I own this one as well.”
