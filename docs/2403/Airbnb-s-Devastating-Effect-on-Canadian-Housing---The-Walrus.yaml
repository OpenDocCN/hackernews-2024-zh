    of 2022\. He’d lived in his spacious apartment in Montreal’s east-end neighbourhood
    of Hochelaga-Maisonneuve for twenty-two years. It was home in the truest sense

    and lived their lives, the local borough established rules in an effort to limit
    short-term tourist accommodations like Airbnb. That was back in 2016, when the
    Mercier–Hochelaga-Maisonneuve borough council was under growing pressure to clamp
    down on the boom in short-term rental suites. So the elected officials drew up
    a set of what they hoped would be relatively simple rules that prohibit—at least
    on paper—apartments being operated as short-term vacation rentals in most areas.
    However, the council permitted vacation rentals “in areas where there are businesses
    and buildings with three or more dwellings.”

    Montréal. Raymond was shocked to learn his building was eligible for short-term
    rentals and that the landlord would evict him for that purpose. “I am very angry

    when he was just fourteen and had been there ever since. “After fifty-four years
    in the same place, it will be difficult to move, especially at my age. It’s demoralizing,”
    he said. Like Raymond and his partner, the elderly man was given six months’ notice.
    They had until July 2023 to find a new place. Not an easy task, given that he
    was paying only $685 for what’s known in Montreal as a 6½ but would be described
    in many other cities as a three-bedroom apartment.

    two-bedroom rental apartment advertised in Montreal had ballooned to $1,800, with
    an average one-bedroom costing $1,470\. Sure, rents in Montreal are still significantly
    lower than those in Toronto and Vancouver, but wages in Montreal are lower too,
    and rents were rising much faster than wages. Those rises were also more pronounced
    in certain areas, like Mercier–Hochelaga-Maisonneuve. Apartments similar in size
    to those rented by Raymond and his neighbour were listed the previous summer for
    $2,500 a month for long-term rentals. Short-term rentals could bring in even more

    was added for good measure. But the publicity would go only so far. What Raymond
    really needed was for the law to back him up. He took the landlord to Quebec’s
    housing tribunal, asking for compensation from the landlord in recognition of
    all the years he and his elderly neighbour had spent in the building. The owners

    If nothing else, they argued, the borough could restrict conversions to apartments
    where a tenant has already decided to leave or if the suite is in a new building.
    But the mayor of Mercier–Hochelaga-Maisonneuve said his hands were tied by provincial
    laws that restricted municipal bans to residential areas. “If it was up to me,
    I would ban rentals for more than thirty days a year on Airbnb throughout the
    territory,” Pierre Lessard-Blais lamented. “Someone who rents out their home for
    a week during their vacation is fine. But when it’s more than thirty days a year,
    it becomes a business that prevents a family from having access to housing in
    a residential area.” City politicians had already asked the Quebec government
    to change the law to ban evictions caused by short-term rental conversions. But

    such bans in place.

    Lessard-Blais 悲叹道。“某人在假期期间出租他们的家一周是可以的。但当超过30天时，它变成了一个企业，阻止了家庭在住宅区找到住房。”市政界已经要求魁北克政府修改法律，以禁止由短期租赁转化引起的驱逐。但是当Raymond和他的邻居收到驱逐通知时，没有这样的禁令。

    make even more money by cashing in on the demand for nightly vacation rentals,
    especially in the summer, when Ontario Street and Sainte-Catherine Street East
    host outdoor festivals. The streets are closed to traffic, so patios and sidewalks
    fill up and visitors pour in. A quick scan of Airbnb shows two-bedroom apartments
    on Ontario Street going for anywhere from $265 to $460 a night in July. Single

    shops, and restaurants in the neighbourhoods where they’re staying—which supports
    local businesses and helps create jobs in the community.” Of course, the same

    is the Canada research chair in urban governance and led a study on the impact
    of short-term rentals in Canada. He concluded that the relatively new revenue
    source for landlords across Canada has been a major cause of housing financialization,
    where housing is treated as a commodity, or a vehicle for profit and investment,
    rather than a social good. He found that most short-term rentals are owned by
    big companies rather than private individuals and that financial incentives placed
    significant pressure on housing as more long-term rentals were converted to short-term
    ones.

- en: Wachsmuth’s study found 31,000 homes were taken out of Canada’s long-term housing
    market as a direct result of short-term rentals. The impact was higher in neighbourhoods
    like Hochelaga-Maisonneuve that have good transit, amenities, and easy access
    to city centres. Across Montreal, Wachsmuth estimates, 6,000 homes were taken
    out of the rental market to be converted into vacation suites. “Removing this
    chunk of short-term rental apartments off the market makes it substantially harder

- en: S hort-term rentals are a long-term concern in many cities, but the worry is
    especially pronounced in Montreal because the city has so many renters. In fact,
    Montreal has the highest share of renter-occupied housing of any large or mid-sized
    North American city. According to the 2016 census, more than 63 percent of Montreal’s
    housing units were rented. The city was known for many years as a renters’ paradise
    because of low rents and high vacancy rates, thanks to an abundance of low-rise
    rental housing. But the seeds of change were sown in the 1990s, when the federal
    government stopped building social housing and legalized real estate investment
    trusts, a model of pooled real estate ownership developed in the United States.
    REITs have been a popular choice for Canadian investors, big and small, and have
    purchased thousands of rental buildings across the country with the purpose of
    maximizing profits for investors. In many cases, that meant renovating old buildings
    to charge much higher rents. For many long-time renters, it led to renoviction—an
    eviction that’s carried out to renovate a rental unit. Rents in Montreal started
    to rise in the 2010s, even though the construction of new purpose-built rental
    units remained healthy. The city added 13,500 purpose-built apartments between
    2016 and 2020, but new rental buildings are exempt from rent-control laws for
    five years after construction.

    is supposed to apply to the rental unit rather than the tenant. But a 2023 study
    into the financialization of rental housing in Montreal found that didn’t always
    work: “In practice there is no way to ensure that rents are not raised illegally
    when a new tenant arrives. There is no registry to consult, the outgoing tenant
    does not always communicate the previous rent to the future tenant, and not everyone
    has the courage to speak up against their landlord’s violations.” Cloé St-Hilaire

    to rent increases “because tenants fear they will lose their homes and be unable

    Cloé St-Hilaire和她的合著者发现，高需求导致许多租户对租金上涨表示抗议，“因为租户害怕失去住所，无法找到替代住处。”这一点并不令人意外，因为2019年蒙特利尔的空置率已降至创纪录的1.6%。所有这些加起来对租户来说都是一场艰难的旅程。

  zh: “我认为魁北克在纸面上有全国最好的制度，”瓦克斯穆斯说，“但它没有努力确保任何人都遵守这些规定。” 希望这只是需要更多时间。 蒙特利尔市允许行政区域，如Mercier-Hochelaga-Maisonneuve，选择将短期租赁限制在一年三十天的地区。
    而魁北克税务局在2021年向短期租赁房东开出了超过900张罚单。 不过，这可能只是Airbnb中的一滴水。 独立的活动家组织Inside Airbnb发现，2021年12月蒙特利尔有12500个Airbnb房源，并声称其中超过95％未经许可。
- en: 'S tories of unlicensed vacation rentals causing problems for neighbours spread
    across Montreal in both official languages: a frat house atmosphere, with people
    vomiting out of windows at 3 a.m. and raves that last until 11 a.m., jammed elevators,
    and wrecked laundry rooms. Of course, bad behaviour has been around a lot longer
    than Airbnb, and many who have stayed in short-term rentals have followed the
    rules and done their best to respect the neighbours. But many neighbours complain
    they don’t like the arrangement and would rather see the surrounding apartments
    occupied by permanent residents.'

  zh: 在蒙特利尔，无牌度假租赁给邻居造成了问题，这种情况在官方语言中广泛传播：像是大学宿舍的氛围，人们在凌晨3点从窗户上呕吐，持续到上午11点的狂欢派对，卡住的电梯和被破坏的洗衣房。当然，不良行为早在Airbnb出现之前就存在了，许多短期租赁者遵守规则，并尽力尊重邻居。但许多邻居抱怨他们不喜欢这种安排，宁愿看到周围的公寓被常驻居民居住。
- en: A musician in her fifties, Rebecca Bain has seen the benefits that affordable
    rents and stable housing bring to a community. “Montreal was a haven for artists,”
    she says wistfully, remembering a time when most of the apartments in her working-class
    neighbourhood were truly affordable for the vast majority of people. She’s called
    Saint-Henri home for more than twenty years but has seen it change rapidly of
    late. She’s watched as the post office and local dépanneurs closed their doors
    and were replaced with expensive restaurants. She noticed fewer families with
    young children on the streets. She understands that young professionals and other
    people moving into the neighbourhood also need a place to live, but she wonders
    where the people who have lived in Saint-Henri for decades will go when they get
    evicted. “The elderly people live on a fixed income. There’s literally nowhere
    else for them to go.”

  zh: 作为一个五十多岁的音乐家，Rebecca Bain 看到了廉租和稳定住房为社区带来的好处。“蒙特利尔曾经是艺术家的避风港，”她感叹道，回忆起在她工人阶级社区的大部分公寓都对绝大多数人来说确实是经济承受得起的时光。她在圣亨利已经生活了二十多年，但最近看到它迅速变化。她看到了邮局和当地的小型便利店关门，并被昂贵的餐厅取而代之。她注意到街上的年幼家庭变少了。她理解年轻专业人士和其他人搬到社区也需要一个居所，但她不知道几十年来一直住在圣亨利的人们在被驱逐后会去哪里。“老年人靠固定收入生活。他们实在没有其他地方可去。”
- en: When the sixplex Bain lived in was sold to a Montreal property company, she
    and all the other tenants in the building received eviction notices. They were
    told the building was going to be renovated, despite having been refurbished just
    a few years earlier. Bain believes the new owners just wanted to make them fancier
    so they could charge more money. First, they got formal letters, then the phone
    calls started. A woman who refused to identify herself called Bain repeatedly.

  zh: 当 Bain 居住的六户公寓被一家蒙特利尔地产公司出售时，她和建筑中的所有其他租户都收到了驱逐通知。他们被告知建筑将进行翻新，尽管仅几年前已经翻新过了。Bain
    认为新业主只是想把它们变得更豪华，以便能收取更高的租金。首先他们收到正式信件，然后电话就开始了。一个拒绝透露身份的女士多次给 Bain 打电话。
- en: Bain then went to her local tenants’ rights group and learned the same company
    had bought several buildings in the neighbourhood and had handed eviction notices
    to more than forty renters. Bain says they all received similarly intimidating
    phone calls. Eventually, all of the other five residents of her building agreed
    to leave. But she refused. “I know my rights.” Along with dozens of other tenants,
    she fought the landlord and was allowed to stay, paying roughly $900 a month for
    her 4½ (small two-bedroom apartment). She lived through all the renovations of
    the other units and befriended the workers, hoping they wouldn’t harass her (they
    didn’t). And when the new tenants moved into her building, they all ended up paying
    much, much more. “So everyone else in my building now pays twice what I pay, and
    every time a new tenant comes in, they add another 200 on.”

  zh: Bain 随后去了当地的租户权利组织，并得知同一家公司购买了附近的几栋建筑，并且对超过四十名租客发出了驱逐通知。Bain 说他们都接到了类似的恐吓电话。最终，她所在建筑的其他五名居民都同意搬走了。但她拒绝了。“我知道我的权利。”与数十名其他租户一起，她与房东斗争，并获准留下，每月支付约900美元租金，住着一个四半（小两居室）公寓。她经历了其他单位的所有翻新工程，并与工人成为朋友，希望他们不会骚扰她（他们没有）。当新租户搬进她的建筑时，他们最终都付出了更多的房租。“因此，我建筑里的其他人现在付的是我支付的两倍，而且每次新租户搬进来，他们又要增加200美元。”
- en: Without a rent registry, there is little oversight. And renters are often relieved
    just to find someplace they can afford, even if it does gobble up a large portion
    of their income. Bain isn’t holding her breath that things will change, and she
    wonders if too many people are more concerned with their own personal gain than
    the overall well-being of their communities. “Housing is a right, and I feel somehow
    it’s become a privilege,” she laments. “It shouldn’t be a luxury to have a decent
    place to live.”

  zh: 没有租金登记制度，监管力度较低。租户往往只要能找到负担得起的住处就很满足了，即便这占去了他们收入的大比例。贝恩并不抱有任何改变的希望，并且在思考是否太多的人更关心个人利益而非整个社区的福祉。她哀叹：“住房是一项权利，我感觉它已经变成了一种特权。”
    “拥有一个体面的居住地不应成为一种奢侈品。”
