- en: Researchers at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center have found that a specific subtype
    of a bacterium commonly found in the mouth is able to travel to the gut and grow
    within colorectal cancer (CRC) tumors. The results of their analyses of human
    tumor tissues, and studies in mice, suggest that this particular lineage, or clade,
    of *Fusobacterium nucleatum* animalis (*Fna*) subspecies, *Fna* C2, is also a
    culprit for driving cancer progression, and leads to poorer patient outcomes after
    cancer treatment.

    for colorectal cancer, which is the second most common cause of cancer deaths
    in adults in the U.S. according to the American Cancer Society. The researchers,
    led by Fred Hutch cancer microbiome researcher Susan Bullman, PhD, and Fred Hutch
    molecular microbiologist Christopher D. Johnston, PhD, believe that their study
    presents significant opportunities for developing microbial cellular therapies
    that use modified versions of bacterial strains to deliver treatments directly
    into tumors.

    in Nature, titled “[A distinct Fusobacterium nucleatum clade dominates the colorectal
    cancer niche](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07182-w),” in which they
    stated, “Collectively, our results identify the *Fna* clade bifurcation, show
    that specifically *Fna* C2 drives the reported *Fn* enrichment in human CRC and
    reveal the genetic underpinnings of pathoadaptation of *Fna* C2 to the CRC niche
    … this work demonstrates that Fna C2 is a highly virulent subgroup of *Fn* that
    should be the primary focus for mechanistic studies and therapeutic drug design
    in CRC.”

    tract of healthy individuals, but has gained attention as an emerging cancer-associated
    bacterium, the authors wrote. “*Fn* species are normal members of the human oral
    microbiota, and strains from the oral cavity are thought to seed CRC tumors.”
    Genomic analyses have  shown that *Fn* is enriched in human CRC tumors, relative
    to non-cancerous colorectal tissues. “High intratumoral *Fn* loads are associated
    with recurrence, metastases and poorer patient prognosis,” they further stated.
    However, there is considerable strain-to-strain variation in *Fn* genotypic and
    phenotypic features, and this heterogeneity has made it challenging for scientists
    to reproduce *Fn* cancer-inducing phenotypes in animal and cellular models. “…
    it has been proposed that only a select group of *Fn* strains may possess carcinogenic
    capabilities,” the team continued.'

    Zepeda-Rivera, PhD, a Washington Research Foundation fellow and staff scientist
    in the Johnston Lab, wanted to discover how the microbe moves from its typical
    environment of the mouth to a distant site in the lower gut and how it contributes
    to cancer growth.

    colorectal cancer tumors, thought to be a single subspecies, is actually composed
    of two distinct lineages, or clades, *Fna* C1 and *Fna* C2\. “Pangenome analysis
    revealed that *Fna* is composed of two distinct clades but only *Fna* C2 is enriched
    in the CRC niche,” they wrote. “This discovery was similar to stumbling upon the
    Rosetta Stone in terms of genetics,” Johnston explained. “We have bacterial strains
    that are so phylogenetically close that we thought of them as the same thing,
    but now we see an enormous difference between their relative abundance in tumors
    versus the oral cavity.”

    found that the tumor-infiltrating *Fna* C2 type had acquired distinct genetic
    traits suggesting it could travel from the mouth through the stomach, withstand
    stomach acid, and then grow in the lower gastrointestinal tract. The analysis
    revealed 195 genetic differences between the clades.

    cancer, the researchers found that only the subtype *Fna* C2 is significantly
    enriched in colorectal tumor tissue and is responsible for colorectal cancer growth.

- en: Further molecular analyses of two patient cohorts, including over 200 colorectal
    tumors, revealed the presence of this *Fna* C2 lineage in approximately 50 percent
    of cases. The researchers also found in hundreds of stool samples from people
    with and without colorectal cancer that *Fna* C2 levels were consistently higher
    in colorectal cancer. “Similar to our observation in CRC tumour tissue … our data
    show that *Fna* C2 is more prevalent and abundant in the stool of patients with
    CRC than *Fna* C1 … and is furthermore the only *Fn* subgroup significantly enriched
    in the stool of patients with CRC compared to healthy  individuals,” they stated.
    Interestingly, the team’s experiments showed that in a mouse model of CRC, animals
    treated using *Fna* C2 demonstrated an increased number of intestinal adenomas
    and altered metabolites. “Overall, our results demonstrate the ability of *Fna*
    C2, but not *Fna* C1, to metabolically affect the intestinal milieu towards pro-oncogenic
    conditions,” they noted.

    nucleatum* have poor survival and poorer prognosis compared with patients without
    the microbe,” Bullman commented. “Now we’re finding that a specific subtype of
    this microbe is responsible for tumor growth. It suggests therapeutics and screening
    that target this subgroup within the microbiota would help people who are at a
    higher risk for more aggressive colorectal cancer.” Johnston added, “We  have
    pinpointed the exact bacterial lineage that is associated with colorectal cancer,
    and that knowledge is critical for developing effective preventive and treatment
    methods.”
