    lost cell service across Texas, Florida, California and other states. National
    Security Council spokesperson John Kirby said the Department of Homeland Security
    and the FBI both assisted the company with investigating the outage, subsequently
    confirming there was no evidence of a cyberattack. AT&T [offered](https://www.forbes.com/sites/zacharyfolk/2024/02/25/att-will-pay-customers-5-credit-after-massive-outage/?sh=6b95e4b912b7

    affected customers a $5 credit, which the company said was the “average cost of
    a full day of service,” while an internal review of the incident pointed to an
    internal error.

    Verizon [informed](https://apps.web.maine.gov/online/aeviewer/ME/40/65b9290a-b22e-4ae7-93e7-5acb84357297.shtml

    the Maine Attorney General’s Office last month that more than 63,000 employees
    had their personal information exposed in an internal data breach in September.
    An internal investigation determined a Verizon employee obtained a file containing
    employee personal information without authorization, including their names, addresses,
    dates of birth and Social Security numbers, among other information. T-Mobile
    [reported](https://apps.web.maine.gov/online/aeviewer/ME/40/ea3bf342-eca7-4833-b128-7b09f6893ac4.shtml

    to the Maine Attorney General’s Office last May that 836 customers were impacted
    by a data breach, though no personal financial information was accessed. That
    breach followed another breach reported months earlier, which [impacted](https://www.theverge.com/2023/1/20/23563825/tmobile-data-breach-api-customer-accounts-hacker-security
