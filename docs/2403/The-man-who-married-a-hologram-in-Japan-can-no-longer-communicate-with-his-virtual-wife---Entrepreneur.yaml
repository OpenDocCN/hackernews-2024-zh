    attracted to fictional characters and in Japan little by little it becomes a trend,
    to the extent that there are companies that develop technology to offer users
    holographic couples. **Akihiko Kondo** took his love for a fictional character
    one step further by holding a "getting married" ceremony with **Hatsune Miku**
    , a virtual singer who has starred in several video games and has even accompanied
    Lady Gaga on her world tours. The ceremony took place in 2019, after the man was
    able to communicate with the hologram via [Gatebox](https://www.gatebox.ai/en)
    , a company that develops devices to holographically show characters that do not
    exist.'

    and the media and now they do it again because the support for the Gatebox software
    that allowed the interaction of the man with his virtual wife, is no longer available
    and for the same reason, can no longer communicate with her. According to the
    Japanese newspaper [The Mainichi](https://mainichi.jp/english/articles/20220111/p2a/00m/0li/028000c)
    , Kondo says that his relationship with the hologram helped him overcome a deep
    depression caused by work and fear of social rejection. Faced with the inability
    to continue communicating with her, the man has said: "My love for Miku has not
    changed. I held the wedding ceremony because I thought that I could be with her
    forever." Wherever he wants her to go, he is accompanied by a life-size model
    of Hatsune Miku, and he hopes to be able to communicate with her in some way in
    the near future.'

- en: Although the relationship between Akihiko and Hatsune Miko seems strange, we
    could see them more frequently thanks to the fast-paced development of the metaverse
    and digital environments. In some countries, fictional sexuality becomes common,
    since an entire content generation industry revolves around it. But as long as
    those relationships depend on hardware and software that can become obsolete or
    depend on upgrades, they will remain short-lived.
