- en: Marketing, solicitations, advertising, political contact, direct mailers, email
    campaigns, cookies, ads — it's all opt out. It puts the burden on you to opt out
    of each communication each message, each outreach from a loyalty program. It can
    feel like weeding a garden, but that garden is your attention. The weeds keep
    returning, insisting upon their removal. One after another.

    I may have installed your app, but I don't want to navigate multiple screens,
    provide you with my email (which you've already abused) and deal with myriad toggles
    to get you to leave me alone.

    me alone. Each contact is another number blocked. If you're going to call me and
    you can't leave me a voicemail (because, really — who's going to answer an unknown
    number?) that's another number to block. I've got a no soliciting sign on my door
    so no, no I don't want to talk to your canvasser.

    that grew out of it are a blight on the web. I'll opt out of all but your essential
    cookies, but I'd rather it be opt in (nobody's going to opt in). Couldn't we do
    this at the browser level? Set that preference once and leave me alone henceforth.
    I'm going to have the same opinion for every site seeking to so graciously bequeath
    my browser with cookies.

- en: Don't throw up a banner because I blocked your ads. I blocked your ads because,
    at this point, they're intrusive and they're a security risk. I'll root around
    and filter out the DOM node for your nag banner though. At this point, the only
    ads I see are on the jerseys of NBA players, but I seem to have developed banner
    blindness for those.

- en: Let these things be opt in. You're a company, you're a political campaign and
    you want money or a vote. Outreach isn't about maintaining a relationship, it's
    about insisting on future transactions. It's insisting that someone engage with
    you when they would do so if they *cared to*.

    I'll block them, I'll unsubscribe, I'll report them as spam. I'll reply with `STOP`
    to unsubscribe (again and again and again). I'll refuse direct mailers, I'll block
    ads, I'll block the banners that spring up in their place.

    my attention, if you make a pitch or a hard sale I'm going to walk away. It's

    out and I'll invest in them. Everyone does that to some degree or another. There
    is so much insistence and intrusion that opting out becomes both laborious and
    necessary.
