    the margin it’s breaking them by — it’s not even close to what the previous record
    was,” said Brian McNoldy, a senior research associate at the University of Miami
    Rosenstiel School of Marine, Atmospheric, and Earth Science. “That’s what’s raising
    the eyebrows of a lot of people.”

    than they were from 1982-2011, [according to the University of Maine’s Climate
    Reanalyzer](https://climatereanalyzer.org/clim/sst_daily/). It’s a huge anomaly
    that could have significant effects on weather and ecosystems.

    is probably not the only factor. Climate models predict a steady rise in sea surface
    temperatures, but not this quickly, and ocean surface temperatures also fluctuate
    and can be affected by natural climate variability, including patterns such as
    El Niño and La Niña.

    but I do fear there may be something else going on that is causing a long-term
    change in sea surface temperatures we hadn’t predicted,” said John Abraham, a
    professor at the University of St. Thomas who studies ocean temperatures. “All
    bets are off now, this is something that is so unusual, it’s challenging our past
    expectations.”

    more intense and fast-developing hurricanes, drive coastal temperatures up and

    to the Climate Reanalyzer, which tracks average measures of sea surface temperature
    data from across the globe. The data used to measure these trends dates back more
    than 40 years and comes from networks of monitoring buoys and robotic devices
    designed to help meteorologists make weather forecasts.

    ocean processes that aren’t well understood playing a role, as well.

    today than they were from 1979-2000, but water has a greater capacity to absorb
    and store heat — the ocean has absorbed about 90% of the heat created by global
    warming. So, seas were not expected to warm this much already.

    warm ocean water in the tropical Pacific Ocean, as a factor driving average sea
    surface temperatures up.

    and can’t be explained by the arguments being given six months ago or 12 months
    ago,” Abraham said. “Sea surface temperatures are higher elsewhere and very far
    from El Niño locations.”

    of trade winds in the North Atlantic, which has reduced the amount of dust blowing
    from Africa’s Sahara Desert  toward North America. Dust absorbs the sun’s energy
    over the Atlantic Ocean, so it’s possible that more radiation is being absorbed
    into the ocean.

    may have reduced sulfur pollution in ship exhaust, ultimately reducing cloud cover

    Warmer water provides more energy for storms to feed on, so “the ones that form
    often become stronger,” Abraham said.

    winds intensify suddenly as they near the shore. Last year, [Hurricane Idalia

    off the west coast of Africa, where the hurricanes that rattle the East Coast
    of the United States often start. What’s more, the National Weather Service’s
    Climate Prediction Center says that there is a 62% chance of a La Niña —  which
