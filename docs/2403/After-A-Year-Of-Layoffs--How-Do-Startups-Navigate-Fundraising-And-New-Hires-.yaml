- en: While many factors came into play, one of the main drivers for layoffs in the
    tech industry in particular can be traced back to the pandemic. Lockdown measures
    and work-from-home mandates saw a boom in e-commerce and cloud services. Large
    tech firms expanded their operations and company valuations soared in line with
    the surge of demand at the time.

    markets contracted sharply.

    laying off workers in their thousands and 2023 became known as ‘‘the year of efficiency.’

    [191,000 workers](https://news.crunchbase.com/startups/tech-layoffs/) at U.S.-based
    tech companies were laid off in mass job cuts in 2023.

    still saw a high number of mass layoffs, with more than 46,000 layoffs in the
    tech industry in the first two months of 2024\. Both large-cap companies and startups
    trimmed staff across the US, according to [Crunchbase data](https://news.crunchbase.com/layoffs/tech-startups-staff-cuts-shutdowns).

    have [fallen](https://pitchbook.com/news/articles/venture-capital-valuations-unicorns-crossover-investors).
    As interest rates rise and tech stocks languish, venture capitalists are holding
    tighter to their funds. Seed stage funding slumped 35 percent for startups year
    over year by late 2022, data from [Crunchbase](https://news.crunchbase.com/venture/global-vc-funding-slide-q4-2022/#Seed%20funding)

    using any hard-won funding from investors.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Before the 2023 layoff trend, startups were more likely to use funding to help
    with new tech hires to focus on product development to build out existing services
    or create new offerings. Now, startups are focusing on hiring sales and marketing
    experts. By using funding to scale up commercial teams, startups are likely trying
    to create a quicker path to revenue that can be demonstrated in figures with 1
    to 2 quarters.

- en: Although senior executives and the expertise they hold often have the ability
    to transform fledgling companies into revenue-generating success stories, the
    limited amount of funding around in 2024 means these high-value hires are too
    hard to justify. What’s more, limited resources overall mean startups are also
    more likely to opt for more junior hires with the view to having them grow into
    the role and alongside the company.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Still, startups have another way to tap into this invaluable expertise. Mass
    layoffs across the industry mean that more senior executives are currently on
    the job market with many keen to explore new projects and opportunities before
    committing to a permanent role. Startups can leverage this trend and use fractional
    hiring to tap into their knowledge for a few days a week without blowing the entire
    staffing budget on one employee.
