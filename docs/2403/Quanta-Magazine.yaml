- en: After a while, my set of pictures started to look like a particular set of graphs
    that were listed in a book about Coxeter groups that was in my office, and I began
    to hope that it was this exact set of graphs. If it was, then that would fill
    in the hole in my proof, and my theorem would be finished. But I couldn’t check
    for sure until I got back into the university after Christmas — this was before
    you could just Google everything. I think the anticipation of having to wait to
    confirm my hunch made it even better when I got to the book and compared my handwritten
    set of diagrams with the ones in the book, and they were indeed a match.

  zh: 过了一会儿，我的一组图片开始看起来像是我办公室里一本关于科克斯特群的书中列出的一组特定图表，我开始希望这确实是那组确切的图表。如果是的话，那将填补我证明中的空白，我的定理将完成。但直到圣诞节后我回到大学之前，我都不能确定，因为那时候你不能随便Google一切。我想等待确认我的直觉的期待感使得当我翻开书并将我手写的图表与书中的图表进行比较时，当时感觉更加美好，而且它们确实是匹配的。

    Almost nobody would argue that any of the novelists you write about in your book
    “discovered” their novels. Is this a fundamental difference between math and literature
    or not?**'

- en: Doing mathematics feels like discovery. If we were inventing the mathematics,
    it surely wouldn’t be so hard to prove things! Sometimes we desperately want something
    to be true, and it isn’t. We can’t avoid the consequences of logic, I suppose.

  zh: 数学的做法感觉像是发现。如果我们是在创造数学，证明事物肯定不会那么困难！有时我们非常希望某件事情是真的，但实际上并不是。我想我们无法逃避逻辑的后果。
- en: It all feels like discovery when you are doing it. Some choices mirror what
    we experience in the real world, like the axioms of geometry we work with, which
    are chosen because that seems to be roughly what reality is like — though even
    there, there’s no such thing as a “point” or a “line” (because we can’t draw something
    that takes up no space, and a line in geometry has no breadth and extends infinitely
    far).

  zh: 在做这件事时，一切都感觉像发现。有些选择与我们在现实世界中经历的相似，就像我们使用的几何公理，选择它们是因为它似乎大致如此 — 虽然即使在那里，也不存在“点”或“线”（因为我们无法画出占据没有空间的东西，而在几何中的线没有宽度并且无限延伸）。
- en: To some extent, there are parallels to this continuum in literature. Once you
    define the rules of a sonnet, you will be hard-pressed to write one whose first
    line ends with “orange” or “chimney.”

- en: 'But I can’t resist sharing something J.R.R. Tolkien said about writing *The
    Hobbit*: “It all began when I was reading exam papers to earn a bit of extra money.
    … Well, one day I came to a blank page in an exam book and I scribbled on it.
    ‘In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit.’ I knew no more about the creatures
    than that, and it was years before his story grew. I don’t know where the word
    came from.”'

  zh: 但我忍不住要分享J.R.R.托尔金在写《霍比特人》时说的一些话：“一切始于我为赚取额外收入而阅读考卷时……有一天我翻开一本考试册子的空白页，我在上面匆匆涂鸦了几笔。‘在地洞里住着一个霍比特人。’关于这些生物，我除此之外一无所知，几年后他的故事渐渐成形。我不知道这个词是从哪里来的。”
