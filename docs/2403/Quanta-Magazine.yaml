- en: After a while, my set of pictures started to look like a particular set of graphs
    that were listed in a book about Coxeter groups that was in my office, and I began
    to hope that it was this exact set of graphs. If it was, then that would fill
    in the hole in my proof, and my theorem would be finished. But I couldn’t check
    for sure until I got back into the university after Christmas — this was before
    you could just Google everything. I think the anticipation of having to wait to
    confirm my hunch made it even better when I got to the book and compared my handwritten
    set of diagrams with the ones in the book, and they were indeed a match.

    Almost nobody would argue that any of the novelists you write about in your book
    “discovered” their novels. Is this a fundamental difference between math and literature
    or not?**'

- en: Doing mathematics feels like discovery. If we were inventing the mathematics,
    it surely wouldn’t be so hard to prove things! Sometimes we desperately want something
    to be true, and it isn’t. We can’t avoid the consequences of logic, I suppose.

- en: It all feels like discovery when you are doing it. Some choices mirror what
    we experience in the real world, like the axioms of geometry we work with, which
    are chosen because that seems to be roughly what reality is like — though even
    there, there’s no such thing as a “point” or a “line” (because we can’t draw something
    that takes up no space, and a line in geometry has no breadth and extends infinitely
    far).

    define the rules of a sonnet, you will be hard-pressed to write one whose first
    line ends with “orange” or “chimney.”

    Hobbit*: “It all began when I was reading exam papers to earn a bit of extra money.
    … Well, one day I came to a blank page in an exam book and I scribbled on it.
    ‘In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit.’ I knew no more about the creatures
    than that, and it was years before his story grew. I don’t know where the word
    came from.”'
