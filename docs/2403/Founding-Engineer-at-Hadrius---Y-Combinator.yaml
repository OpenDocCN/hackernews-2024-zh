    starting a robo-advisor (Quantbase) with thousands of clients. We expect each
    other to work at our best and constantly challenge ourselves to find ways to grow
    faster and deliver a better customer experience. The result is a tight-knit company
    growing rapidly as the cutting edge upstart in an old industry.

    know each other on a personal level. The team is largely remote, but our main
    office is in New York City on Wall Street where you’ll be working a few days a
    week. We will frequently get together - either in NYC, or SF, or at a week long
    Airbnb in some cool location, to work together in-person 3-5 times a year.
