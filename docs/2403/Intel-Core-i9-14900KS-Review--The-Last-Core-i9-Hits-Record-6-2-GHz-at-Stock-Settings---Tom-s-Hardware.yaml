- en: Intel's Core i9-14900KS Special Edition processor has the highest clock rate
    of any desktop PC processor yet, blasting up to 6.2 GHz on two cores and allowing
    Intel to claim once again that it has the fastest desktop processor in the world.
    But at $689, the 14900KS is not only Intel's fastest mainstream chip, it's also
    the priciest. The 14900KS faces off with AMD's brutally competitive Ryzen 7000X3D
    processors, which still hold the title of the fastest gaming chips around, albeit
    with a narrowing margin, as Intel seeks to dethrone AMD's top processors on our
    list of the [best CPUs for gaming](https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/best-cpus,3986.html).

    Like Intel''s past Special Edition chips, the Core i9-14900KS is forged from the
    company''s highest-binned silicon to deliver the fastest processing speeds at
    the lowest possible voltages at any given frequency. This allows it to hit the
    previously unheard of 6.2 GHz on two cores right out of the box, using conventional
    cooling. However, Intel throws power consumption out the window to hit peak performance:
    The 14900KS gobbled up to 325W of power in our testing.'

    same physical design with eight threaded P-cores and 16 single-threaded E-cores.
    The primary difference is that the 14900KS's P-cores have a 200 MHz higher Thermal
    Velocity Boost (TVB) than the standard 14900K, meaning the chip can hit 6.2 GHz
    on two cores if it remains under 70C. The P-cores are also 100 MHz faster during
    standard Turbo Boost 3.0, while the E-cores have a 100 MHz boost clock increase.

    Core i9-14900KS comes with the tradeoff of a voracious power appetite that peaks
    at 320W and 400 Amps in the Extreme Power Profile, but that's only if you adhere
    to the recommendations — higher settings are readily available with this fully
    overclockable chip. That type of power consumption requires powerful and pricey
    supporting components, like a robust 600- or 700-series Z-chipset motherboard
    and a high-end power supply that together can deliver high levels of current for
    long periods of time.

    guarantees your CPU cooler will limit your performance — you'll need to plan for
    a 360mm AIO watercooler or better. Despite using a 360mm cooler for our testing,
    our chip consistently hit 100C during heavily threaded work, but as we'll explain
    in the thermal and power section below, that's by design (mostly).

    (but unspecified) number of these processors. In fact, this is Intel's fourth
    iteration of the same chip design that first came to market with the same allotment
    of cores and cache in 2022\. It arrived first as the [Core i9-13900K](https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/intel-core-i9-13900k-i5-13600k-cpu-review),
    then progressed to the [13900KS](https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/intel-core-i9-13900ks-cpu-review),
    [14900K](https://www.tomshardware.com/news/intel-core-i9-14900k-cpu-review), and
    now, in 2024, the 14900KS. Each iteration has brought higher clock speeds and
    more performance, but the Core i9 KS chips have historically brought the slimmest
    of gains.

    any illusions of a value proposition — the 14900KS is unabashedly designed for
    deep-pocketed enthusiasts and extreme overclockers who don't mind paying a premium
    for the last few percentage points of performance, especially because the extra
    fee guarantees the highest-binned silicon possible. Let's see how the chip looks
    in our gaming and application benchmarks and then take a look at power consumption
    and thermals.

    — we received it about 36 hours before publication time. Several of the games
    we use for benchmarking received updates since our last round of testing, necessitating
    retesting and ultimately resulting in fewer tested configurations than usual.
    We also didn't have time to try our hand at overclocking, but there should be
    at least some headroom for higher dual-core clocks with conventional cooling.

    policy of allowing the motherboard to exceed Intel's recommended power limits
    — even exceeding the Extreme Power Profile — provided the chip remains within
    warrantied operating conditions. Almost all enthusiast-class motherboards have
    similar default settings, reflecting the out-of-the-box experience. These lifted
    power limits equate to more power consumption and heat, but you get faster performance
    in exchange. We tested the Core i9-14900KS with both stock memory and XMP configurations
    (marked as DDR5-6800 in the charts).

    slightly. Be aware that the X3D chips are also specialty processors, in that they
    come with a tremendous slab of game-boosting L3 cache but aren't as powerful in
    standard productivity applications. They also don't accelerate all games equally,
    so be sure to [do your research](https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/amd-ryzen-9-7950x3d-cpu-review)

    it falls outside of what we would expect from normal run-to-run variance. Most
    users who buy a $689 chip will be gaming at higher resolutions than 1080p anyway,
    and the difference between the vanilla and KS models is still only 2.5% at 1440p.

- en: Overall, the two 14900K/S chips are closely matched in terms of threaded horsepower,
    but the KS carves out a slight lead in every benchmark. It can hit 100 MHz higher
    on the multi-threaded clocks, which represents a 1.8% theoretical improvement.
    The Intel chips trade blows with the Ryzen 9 7950X throughout this series of benchmarks,
    but the 7950X3D isn't quite as potent due to its use of a 3D-stacked L3 cache
    that [restricts clock speeds on one of the CPU chiplets](https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/amd-ryzen-9-7950x3d-cpu-review/3).

- en: Despite using a 360mm Corsair iCue Link H150i watercooler, we peaked at 100C
    for extended periods of time during our tests. That's because the chip has [Adaptive
    Boost Technology](https://www.tomshardware.com/news/intel-core-i9-12900ks-cpu-review)
    (ABT), which dynamically boosts to higher all-core frequencies based on available
    thermal headroom and electrical conditions.
  id: totrans-split-145
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: By design, ABT allows the chip to operate at 100C during normal operation. If
    the chip runs under the 100C threshold, it will consume more power until it reaches
    the safe 100C limit, thus extracting the utmost performance within the available
    thermal headroom. ABT improvements will vary. The frequency uplift depends upon
    the quality of your chip, along with cooling and power delivery capabilities.
    The silicon lottery also comes into play.
  id: totrans-split-146

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We reached Intel's performance guidelines for performance in single- and multi-threaded
    workloads, but better cooling, which would require a custom loop in this case,
    might be able to eke out a bit more performance. However, the chip is at the top
    of the voltage/frequency curve, where increased power consumption is incredibly
    inefficient. As you near peak power, double-digit percentage increases in power
    consumption often only yield single-percentage performance gains, so slightly
    higher power will not make much difference in actual benchmarks.

    materially impact Intel's 14th Gen competitive positioning against AMD's Ryzen

    and the $689 price tag. The chip is purpose-built for deep-pocketed enthusiasts

    this class of chip, you'll also want to buy a quality XMP memory kit to eke out

    That makes Special Edition chips popular with extreme overclockers, especially
    those chasing world records. Unfortunately, we didn't have time to test overclocking
    with our chip; we only had about a day and a half to complete our testing. However,
    the overclocking advantage can vary, and we've seen cases, albeit rare, where
