    could be made to withstand temperatures up to 600 °C using more heat-resistant
    titanium alloys, for applications in aerospace or firefighting drones.

    printing process will become much faster, enabling a larger audience to implement
    our high-strength multi-topology metamaterials in their components. Importantly,
    metal 3D printing allows easy net shape fabrication for real applications.”
