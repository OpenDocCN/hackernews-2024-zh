- en: 1) I know this new compiler is very early in its development, but do you have
    plans to offer a tile/sprite editor, or a sound/music editor? If it's not something
    you've thought a lot about so far, perhaps you could collaborate with people on
    AtariAge who have already made such editors (mostly for data import/export functionalities)?

- en: 2) While the programming language is a central part of the project, another
    very important part is the debugger. Do you plan to add a proper debugger (with
    breakpoints, RAM usage monitor, interrupt monitor and time-to-next-VBLANK monitor)
    into CoolCV? One thing that is difficult with programming for the ColecoVision
    is that you don't have any real control over when the VBLANK NMI happens, and
    if your code tries to do too many operations between VBLANKs, this results in
    graphic corruption, and perhaps even complete runtime crashes.

- en: 3) Your sample Basic code doesn't seem to have any provisions for specifying
    the compiling setup (i.e. does the game use bankswitching (32K, MegaCart, Activision
    PCB), does it require the Super Game Module, is it supposed to support (or ignore)
    interrupts from the Roller Controller, that kind of thing).

- en: 4) Will you be offering built-in functions with the language? For example, a
    standard function to detect the SGM, or a function to clear VRAM at boot/reset,
    or a function to initialize the sound chip into "silent" mode, so programmers
    won't need to code their own routines?
