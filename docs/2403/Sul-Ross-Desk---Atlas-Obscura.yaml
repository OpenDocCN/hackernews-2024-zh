- en: In 1979, three students at Sul Ross State University decided they needed a spot
    away from campus to study. And why not grind on those exam reviews with a view?
    So Jim Kitchen, Bill Wagner, and Travis Miller carted a desk up to the top of
    Hancock Hill, north of campus.

    in the great views offered by the west Texas sun and expansive plains and mountains
    extending in every direction. One of the students decided to bring a notebook
    and wrote a note in it. When he returned later, he discovered that someone had
    replied. So began an epistolary tradition that now spans four decades.

- en: Today, the notebook kept in the desk’s drawer offers visitors the chance to
    write to other visitors and reflect on what it means to leave a mark and make
    a statement in such a place at whatever moment in time they happen to be there. Completed
    notebooks from the Sol Ross desk are kept at the [Archives of the Big Bend](https://library.sulross.edu/archives/).
    According to a [review of the notebooks by *Texas Monthly*](https://www.texasmonthly.com/being-texan/notebooks-hancock-hill-desk-alpine/),
    most of the writers are anonymous and entries range from short declarative statements
    (declarations of love, a simple statement of what date two names were there),
    to longer, more personal writing (reflections on the passage of time, a message
    to a lost loved one, confessions of deeply-held secrets).

    desk is the fourth one to occupy this site. Though the furniture has changed,
    the sentiment remains the same—there’s always a place to sit and collect your
    thoughts atop Hancock Hill.

    accessible by car. Maps at the Hancock Hill trailhead, behind Mountainside Hall,
    show the path to The Desk. The hike is about two miles out and back.
