    diplomats and other government employees who suffer mysterious health problems
    once dubbed "Havana syndrome," researchers reported Monday.

    for symptoms including headaches, balance problems and difficulties with thinking
    and sleep that were first reported in Cuba in 2016 and later by hundreds of American
    personnel in multiple countries.

    also grew concerned, commissioning a clinical study by a team of multidisciplinary
    researchers in Halifax, affiliated with the Brain Repair Centre, Dalhousie University
    and the Nova Scotia Health Authority. A study posited that neurotoxic agents used
    in pesticide fumigation could be a factor in some of the symptoms experienced.

    were diagnosed with a balance problem called persistent postural-perceptual dizziness,
    or PPPD. Linked to inner-ear problems as well as severe stress, it results when
    certain brain networks show no injury but don't communicate properly. French called
    it a "maladaptive response," much like how people who've slouched to alleviate
    back pain can have posture trouble even after the pain is gone.
