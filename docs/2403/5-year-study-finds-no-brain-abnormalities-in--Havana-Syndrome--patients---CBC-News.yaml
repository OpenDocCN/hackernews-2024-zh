    and the Nova Scotia Health Authority. A study posited that neurotoxic agents used
    in pesticide fumigation could be a factor in some of the symptoms experienced.

    do nothing to undermine the theory that a foreign adversary is harming U.S. personnel

    were diagnosed with a balance problem called persistent postural-perceptual dizziness,
    or PPPD. Linked to inner-ear problems as well as severe stress, it results when
    certain brain networks show no injury but don't communicate properly. French called
    it a "maladaptive response," much like how people who've slouched to alleviate
    back pain can have posture trouble even after the pain is gone.
