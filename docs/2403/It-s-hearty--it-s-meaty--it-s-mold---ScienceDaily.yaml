    from organisms that have evolved to be really good at certain things," said Hill-Maini,
    who is a postdoctoral researcher at UC Berkeley in the lab of bioengineering expert
    Jay Keasling. "What we''re trying to do is to look at what is the fungus making
    and try to kind of unlock and enhance it. And I think that''s an important angle
    that we don''t need to introduce genes from wildly different species. We''re investigating
    how we can stitch things together and unlock what''s already there."'

- en: In their recent paper, publishing on March 14 in *Nature Communications*, Hill-Maini
    and colleagues at UC Berkeley, the Joint BioEnergy Institute, and the Novo Nordisk
    Foundation Center for Biosustainability studied a multicellular fungus called
    *Aspergillus oryzae*, also known as koji mold, that has been used in East Asia
    to ferment starches into sake, soy sauce, and miso for centuries. First, the team
    used CRISPR-Cas9 to develop a gene editing system that can make consistent and
    reproducible changes to the koji mold genome. Once they had established a toolkit
    of edits, they applied their system to make modifications that elevate the mold
    as a food source. First, Hill-Maini focused on boosting the mold's production
    of heme -- an iron-based molecule which is found in many lifeforms butis most
    abundant in animal tissue, giving meat its color and distinctive flavor. (A synthetically
    produced plant-derived heme is also what gives the Impossible Burger its meat-duping
    properties.) Next, the team punched up production of ergothioneine, an antioxidant
    only found in fungi that is associated with cardiovascular health benefits.

  zh: 在他们最近的论文中，于2024年3月14日发表在*自然通讯*杂志上，UC伯克利分校的Hill-Maini及其同事，联合生物能源研究所和Novo Nordisk基金会生物可持续中心，研究了一种名为*Aspergillus
    oryzae*的多细胞真菌，也被称为麴霉，几个世纪以来一直被用于在东亚发酵淀粉，制成清酒、酱油和味噌。首先，该团队使用CRISPR-Cas9开发了一个基因编辑系统，可以对麴霉基因组进行一致和可重复的改变。一旦他们建立了一套编辑工具，他们就将其应用于使麴霉成为食物来源的修改。首先，Hill-Maini专注于提高真菌对血红素的产量——一种基于铁的分子，许多生物中都存在，但在动物组织中最丰富，赋予肉类其颜色和独特的风味。（合成生产的植物来源血红素也是Impossible
    Burger赋予其仿肉特性的原因。）接下来，团队增加了色氨酸的产量，一种仅在真菌中发现的抗氧化剂，与心血管健康益处相关。

- en: Hill-Maini's next objective is to make the fungi even more appealing by tuning
    the genes that control the mold's texture. "We think that there's a lot of room
    to explore texture by varying the fiber-like morphology of the cells. So, we might
    be able to program the structure of the lot fibers to be longer which would give
    a more meat-like experience. And then we can think about boosting lipid composition
    for mouth feel and further nutrition," said Hill-Maini, who was a Fellow of the
    Miller Institute for Basic Research in Science at UC Berkeley during the study.
    "I'm really excited about how can we further look at the fungus and, you know,
    tinker with its structure and metabolism for food."

  zh: Hill-Maini的下一个目标是通过调节控制霉菌质地的基因使真菌更具吸引力。“我们认为通过改变细胞的纤维样形态，可以探索质地的多样性。因此，我们可能能够编程地让纤维的结构更长，这将带来更类似肉的体验。然后我们可以考虑增强脂质组成以提升口感和进一步的营养，”在研究期间担任加州大学伯克利分校米勒基础研究科研究员的Hill-Maini说道。“我对如何进一步研究真菌以及如何调整其结构和新陈代谢以用于食品制造感到非常兴奋。”
- en: Though this work is just the beginning of the journey to tap into fungal genomes
    to create new foods, it showcases the huge potential of these organisms to serve
    as easy-to-grow protein sources that avoid the complex ingredients lists of current
    meat substitutes and the cost barriers and technical difficulties hindering the
    launch of cultured meat. Additionally, the team's gene editing toolkit is huge
    leap forward for the field of synthetic biology as a whole. Currently, a great
    variety of biomanufactured goods are made by engineered bacteria and yeast, the
    single-celled cousins of mushrooms and mold. Yet despite humanity's long history
    of domesticating fungi to eat directly or to make staples like miso, multicellular
    fungi have not yet been harnessed as engineered cellular factories to the same
    extent because their genomes are far more complex, and have adaptations that make
    gene editing a challenge. The CRISPR-Cas9 toolkit developed in this paper lays
    the foundation to easily edit koji mold and its many relatives.

- en: Given his culinary background, Hill-Maini is keen to ensure that the next generation
    of fungi-based products are not only palatable, but truly desirable to customers,
    including those with sophisticated tastes. In a separate study, he and Keasling
    collaborated with chefs at Alchemist, a two-Michelin-starred restaurant in Copenhagen,
    to play with the culinary potential of another multicellular fungus, *Neurospora
    intermedia.* This fungus is traditionally used in Indonesia to produce a staple
    food called oncom by fermenting the waste products left over from making other
    foods, such as tofu. Intrigued by its ability to convert leftovers into a protein-rich
    food, the scientists and chefs studied the fungus in the Alchemist test kitchen.
    They discovered *N. intermedia* produces and excretes many enzymes as it grows.
    When grown on starchy rice, the fungi produces an enzyme that liquifies the rice
    and makes it intensely sweet. "We developed a process with just three ingredients
    -- rice, water, and fungus -- to make a beautiful, striking orange-colored porridge,"
    said Hill-Maini. "That became a new dish on the tasting menu that utilizes fungal
    chemistry and color in a dessert. And I think that what it really shows is that
    there's opportunity to bridge the laboratory and the kitchen."
