    been shuttered. But the company didn’t announce its cancellation. In fact, Apple
    barely ever mentioned the secretive project despite laboring on it for nearly
    a decade.

- en: Project Titan was obvious from the outside — from automotive industry hiring
    to heavily documented, public testing of self-driving cars, there was no way it
    could stay a secret. But the company still tried to preserve the mystery — when
    CEO Tim Cook was asked about the project on an investor call in 2016, he [responded
    with cryptic talk](/2016/2/26/11120574/tim-cook-apple-car-speculation-like-christmas-eve)

    dashing the hopes of any Apple fan who dreamed of cruising around in a Jony Ive-designed
    roadster. But Apple’s car considerations go back a bit farther than 2014, the
    year early reports pegged the company’s first real moves to spin up Project Titan.
    A little over eight years ago, Nest founder Tony Fadell revealed that, while he
    was still at Apple, he and Steve Jobs had [tossed around the idea for an Apple
    Car in 2008](/2015/11/4/9668512/apple-car-2008-steve-jobs-tony-fadell).

    Apple was full of momentum and growing fatter with cash every day, but there was
    no guarantee that its devices would keep the company expanding with their upward
    sales trajectory.

    many pies — computers, phones, audio players, for instance, and it was preparing
    to launch its smartwatch and line of Bluetooth headphones. If it was going to

    fine a cautionary tale about that as any.
