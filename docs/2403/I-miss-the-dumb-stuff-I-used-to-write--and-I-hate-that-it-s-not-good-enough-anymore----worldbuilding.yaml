    about believable stories and true-to-life models and cliches and details and structures.
    I've learned rules and how to break them, and boy have I heard a lot about what
    people don't like.

- en: I know more about the craft than I ever did, and I haven't been satisfied with
    anything I've put together in like a decade. I look back on the characters I used
    to write and the stories and worlds I came up with, drawing on note paper or filling
    sketchbooks with hand drawn comics, or writing mini-fiction in Word, and there's
    still a ton of stuff that I like there, but I would never give it a pass today.

- en: I used to write characters with descriptions like "half-evil, half-robot". Is
    that coherent? Shit no! But it's more fun than, "This city has cliffs and the
    lizard people built some houses on them so they could fish from the ocean below
    them." Now my new characters are just accessories to my new setting. I spend all
    my time making sure the tourism industry in a frontier town feels plausible. I
    feel stupid if I imagine a bridge that's too long. And now I feel stupid for feeling
    stupid. But I'll do it again!

    or characters with sensible motivations. I'm a Dragon Ball fan, man, I don't care
    about anything but a good time. I want comedy, and crazy stupid intense beautiful
    melodrama in an alien kingdom balancing on the edge of a cosmic knife. Or at least
    I did. I don't know what happened to me. Maybe endless internet videos and essays
    about media criticism and "tips for writers" happened.

    of this particular god's worship is believable compared to how actual religions
    change over time, when I used to just be like, "The god of order is a three-eyed
    six-armed black serpent with a jagged hawk beak and dragon wings, flippin' radical.
    His genies can be flying snakes. They hate the chaos genies, who are made of the
    most chaotic things known to man - slime and lightning."

    The thing is, I never *tried* to write wild and crazy stuff. I just drew cartoons
    and wrote around them, fulfilling whatever my interests were at any moment. Every
    stupid idea I ever had, *every one*, wound up a character in these stupid worlds,
    and it was fun, and I'd be embarrassed trying to explain it now.

    of me?

- en: 'EDIT: The death of Akira Toriyama was just reported. I can''t even come close
    to describing the full impact he had on my drawing and storytelling. What I can
    say is that the loss of a cartoonist idol has only sharpened this feeling that
    I''m drifting away from something special that I need to have back again. His
    work was the first thing that ever got me to really dream about what could be
    discovered in impossible worlds if we just explore. So many notebook pages filled,
    so many sketchbooks, so many planets and realms and times and people. So many
    unreal things realized just for the joy of making them. I am missing something.
    I can''t quite name it, but maybe I need to relearn some old lessons to receive
    it again.'

  zh: EDIT：据报道，**鸟山明**去世了。我无法用言语描述他对我的绘画和故事讲述技巧所产生的深远影响。但我可以说的是，失去了一位漫画偶像，让我更加深刻地感受到，我正逐渐远离某种特别的东西，我需要重新拥有它。他的作品是我第一次真正梦想到，如果我们只是去探索，不可能的世界中会发现什么。那么多笔记本页被填满，那么多画册，那么多星球、境界、时光和人物。那么多不真实的事物，只是为了制造它们带来的快乐而实现。我在失去着什么。我无法完全说出它是什么，但也许我需要重新学习一些旧的经验，才能再次得到它。
