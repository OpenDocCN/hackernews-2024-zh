- en: I've learned a lot over the years, a lot of dos and don'ts, a lot of things
    about believable stories and true-to-life models and cliches and details and structures.
    I've learned rules and how to break them, and boy have I heard a lot about what
    people don't like.

  zh: 多年来我学到了很多东西，很多应该做和不应该做的事情，关于可信故事和真实模型、陈词滥调、细节和结构。我学会了规则以及如何打破规则，而我真的听说了很多关于人们不喜欢什么的事情。
- en: I know more about the craft than I ever did, and I haven't been satisfied with
    anything I've put together in like a decade. I look back on the characters I used
    to write and the stories and worlds I came up with, drawing on note paper or filling
    sketchbooks with hand drawn comics, or writing mini-fiction in Word, and there's
    still a ton of stuff that I like there, but I would never give it a pass today.

  zh: 我现在比以往任何时候都更了解这门艺术，但我十年来从未对自己的任何作品感到满意。我回顾我过去写过的角色和故事，以及我构想的世界，在笔记纸上画图或填充手绘漫画的画册中写小说，还有很多我喜欢的东西，但今天我绝对不会再给它们打分通过了。
- en: I used to write characters with descriptions like "half-evil, half-robot". Is
    that coherent? Shit no! But it's more fun than, "This city has cliffs and the
    lizard people built some houses on them so they could fish from the ocean below
    them." Now my new characters are just accessories to my new setting. I spend all
    my time making sure the tourism industry in a frontier town feels plausible. I
    feel stupid if I imagine a bridge that's too long. And now I feel stupid for feeling
    stupid. But I'll do it again!

  zh: 我曾经写过像“半邪恶、半机器人”这样的角色描述。这合理吗？当然不！但比起“这座城市有悬崖，蜥蜴人在上面建了些房子，这样他们可以从下面的海洋中捕鱼”，这更有趣。现在我的新角色只是我的新背景的配件。我花了所有时间确保边境小镇的旅游业感觉合理。如果我想象一个太长的桥，我会觉得很愚蠢。现在我觉得自己为感到愚蠢而感到愚蠢。但我还是会再次这样做！
- en: The thing is, I don't even really care about believable or consistent worlds,
    or characters with sensible motivations. I'm a Dragon Ball fan, man, I don't care
    about anything but a good time. I want comedy, and crazy stupid intense beautiful
    melodrama in an alien kingdom balancing on the edge of a cosmic knife. Or at least
    I did. I don't know what happened to me. Maybe endless internet videos and essays
    about media criticism and "tips for writers" happened.

  zh: 问题在于，我真的不在乎可信或一致的世界，或者有合理动机的角色。我是个《龙珠》的粉丝，老兄，我只在乎享受。我想要喜剧，还有在宇宙刀刃边缘上平衡的外星王国里的疯狂愚蠢、强烈美妙的情感戏。或者至少我曾经是这样。我不知道我怎么了。也许是无休止的网络视频和关于媒体批评以及“作家技巧”的论文发生了什么。
- en: Why do I find myself sitting here wondering whether the historical progression
    of this particular god's worship is believable compared to how actual religions
    change over time, when I used to just be like, "The god of order is a three-eyed
    six-armed black serpent with a jagged hawk beak and dragon wings, flippin' radical.
    His genies can be flying snakes. They hate the chaos genies, who are made of the
    most chaotic things known to man - slime and lightning."

  zh: 为什么我会坐在这里，想着这位特定神的崇拜历史进展是否比起实际宗教随时间改变更可信，而我过去只会说，“秩序之神是一条有三只眼睛、六只手臂、带有参差鹰喙和龙翼的黑色巨蛇，太炫酷了。他的精灵可以是飞行蛇。他们讨厌混沌精灵，后者由人类所知最混乱的东西组成
    - 黏液和闪电。”
- en: I wish I could forget a lot of what I know. I want to go back to the old days.
    The thing is, I never *tried* to write wild and crazy stuff. I just drew cartoons
    and wrote around them, fulfilling whatever my interests were at any moment. Every
    stupid idea I ever had, *every one*, wound up a character in these stupid worlds,
    and it was fun, and I'd be embarrassed trying to explain it now.

  zh: 我希望我能忘记我所知道的很多东西。我想回到过去的日子。问题是，我从未*试图*写出疯狂而又疯狂的东西。我只是画卡通，围绕它们写作，随时满足我当时的兴趣。我曾经有过的每一个愚蠢主意，*每一个*，最终都成为了这些愚蠢世界中的一个角色，那很有趣，但现在我尝试解释它们时会感到尴尬。
- en: I want to stop thinking so much. I want to stop measuring everything I come

- en: 'EDIT: The death of Akira Toriyama was just reported. I can''t even come close
    to describing the full impact he had on my drawing and storytelling. What I can
    say is that the loss of a cartoonist idol has only sharpened this feeling that
    I''m drifting away from something special that I need to have back again. His
    work was the first thing that ever got me to really dream about what could be
    discovered in impossible worlds if we just explore. So many notebook pages filled,
    so many sketchbooks, so many planets and realms and times and people. So many
    unreal things realized just for the joy of making them. I am missing something.
    I can''t quite name it, but maybe I need to relearn some old lessons to receive
    it again.'

  zh: EDIT：据报道，**鸟山明**去世了。我无法用言语描述他对我的绘画和故事讲述技巧所产生的深远影响。但我可以说的是，失去了一位漫画偶像，让我更加深刻地感受到，我正逐渐远离某种特别的东西，我需要重新拥有它。他的作品是我第一次真正梦想到，如果我们只是去探索，不可能的世界中会发现什么。那么多笔记本页被填满，那么多画册，那么多星球、境界、时光和人物。那么多不真实的事物，只是为了制造它们带来的快乐而实现。我在失去着什么。我无法完全说出它是什么，但也许我需要重新学习一些旧的经验，才能再次得到它。
