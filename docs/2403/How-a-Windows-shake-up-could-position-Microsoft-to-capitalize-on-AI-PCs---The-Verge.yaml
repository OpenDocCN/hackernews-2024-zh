    last year, the software giant quickly split his two divisions into two different
    teams. It was a move designed to push Windows engineers to focus on more web and
    AI features under Mikhail Parakhin, who was previously responsible for Bing and
    ads. It didn’t work out.

    will now take over the company’s consumer AI push as the CEO of Microsoft AI.
    The hiring of Suleyman is a key admission that something wasn’t working out with
    the Windows and AI shake-up from six months ago.

    had taken on parts of Windows engineering after Panay’s departure last year, and
    he had been working closely on Bing Chat and several Microsoft Edge features.
    Parakhin’s official title was CEO of advertising and web services at Microsoft,
    so if he remained in his position then he would have been a CEO, reporting to
    the Microsoft AI CEO, who reports to the actual Microsoft CEO. That’s a lot of
    CEOs, and Microsoft typically reserves CEO titles for big acquisitions like LinkedIn
    or GitHub, or for big divisions like Microsoft Gaming.

    new roles” according to a Microsoft internal memo obtained by *The Verge*. He
    will report to Kevin Scott, the [previous face](/23900198/microsoft-kevin-scott-ai-art-bing-google-nvidia-decoder-interview)

    will be leaving Microsoft soon.

    one of the “fastest rising leaders in the company” just six months ago. Parakhin
    was responsible for Microsoft’s reborn advertising business and all of the company’s
    ad-based consumer businesses. It’s a big organization of more than 10,000 people,
    but some were frustrated with the way it was being managed. [*Bloomberg* reported](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-03-26/microsoft-bing-chief-exiting-role-after-suleyman-named-ai-leader?srnd=undefined&embedded-checkout=true)

    team that Parakhin led had a different culture from the rest of Microsoft that
    often resulted in micromanaging and “insane deadlines” for projects. It’s been
    described as a culture of being forced to do more with less.

    with Intel. While Microsoft has experimented with custom Qualcomm-powered chips
    for its Surface devices in the past, there has always been an Intel option for
    consumers to fall back on. Microsoft appears to have much more confidence in Qualcomm’s
    latest Snapdragon Elite X processors, because I understand it’s about to only
    offer these chips to consumers on an OLED version of the Surface Pro 10.

    been at the center of it. If the performance of the Snapdragon X Elite is greatly
    improved and Microsoft’s app emulation efforts are solid, we could be about to
    witness an Arm transition for Windows laptops that has been years in the making.
    Microsoft won’t have the luxury of dropping Intel in quite the same fashion as
    Apple did with its transition to its own silicon, but by only shipping Surface
    consumer devices on Arm, it’s putting down a new line in the silicon sand.
