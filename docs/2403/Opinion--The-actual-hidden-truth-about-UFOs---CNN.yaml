    public with an explosive allegation. Facing a scrum of TV cameras and members

    happen on the news. The former Pentagon official, David Grusch, had been an Air
    Force intelligence officer. He told a [congressional committee](https://www.cnn.com/videos/us/2023/07/26/ufo-whistleblower-military-pilots-david-grusch-cprog-orig-ht-js.cnn) that
    he’d learned of a decades-long Pentagon program focused on “crash retrieval and
    reverse engineering” of UFOs from other planets. Grusch also said that remains
    found at the spacecraft crash sites were “[non-human biologics](https://www.npr.org/2023/07/27/1190390376/ufo-hearing-non-human-%20biologics-uaps).”

    scientist and intelligence officer named Sean Kirkpatrick to set up a new office
    tasked with investigating UFO sightings by the US military. Named the All-domain
    Anomaly Resolution Office by the US Department of Defense, Kirkpatrick told us
    his [team dug into UFO cases and interviewed US service members who said](https://www.defense.gov/News/News-Stories/Article/Article/3249317/dod-office-moving-ahead-in-mission-to-identify-anomalous-%20phenomena/) they
    had knowledge about encounters with UFOs.

    for the Audible podcast “[In the Room](https://www.audible.com/pd/Episode-38-Is-The-Pentagon-Really-Hiding-Crashed-Alien-Spaceships-Podcast/B0BZ29R9CH?ref_pageloadid=not_applicable&ref=a_pd_In-the_c3_lAsin_0_0&pf_rd_p=625c212d-b95a-47db-8d56-d35a359de6e9&pf_rd_r=YBQ3ZG874HRVM1S1S6TD&pageLoadId=wH034t3pndDW1uCB&creativeId=6c5159d7-bb10-4fb4-929b-ae2b2f5000c7).”
    Kirkpatrick and his team investigated every US government UFO sighting going back
    to Roswell in the 1940s, putting the findings in a report that the Pentagon [released
    publicly](https://media.defense.gov/2024/Mar/08/2003409233/-1/-1/0/DOPSR-CLEARED-508-COMPLIANT-HRRV1-08-MAR-2024-FINAL.PDF)

    of any purported cover up of those visits.

    case that the stories swirling for decades about the alleged government cover-up
    of alien-related UFOs may well have been fueled largely by true believers inside
    the US government or with close ties to it.

    was first coined, much of the conspiratorial thinking about UFOs has been spawned
    by people catching glimpses of highly secret US aircraft and wanting answers.
    And when the government doesn’t provide answers, the public imagination takes
    over.

    are of advanced technology that the US government needs to keep secret, of aircraft
    that rival nations are using to spy on the US or of benign civilian drones and
    balloons.

    a prominent role in UFO lore. That’s because, in 1947, a US military news release
    stated that a flying saucer had crashed near Roswell Army Air Field in [New Mexico](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smithsonian-institution/in-1947-high-altitude-balloon-crash-landed-roswell-aliens-never-left-180963917/).

  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    weather balloon. Newspapers[ ran the initial saucer headline, followed up with
    the official debunking](https://www.washingtonpost.com/history/2022/07/08/roswell-flying-saucer-ufo/),
    and interest in the case largely died down. Until 1980, that is, when a pair of
    UFO researchers published a book alleging that alien bodies had been recovered
    from the Roswell wreckage and that the US government had covered up the evidence.

- en: Kirkpatrick says his office dug deep into the Roswell incident and found that
    in the late 1940s and early 1950s, there were a lot of things happening near the
    Roswell Airfield. There was a spy program called [Project Mogul](https://www.nytimes.com/1994/09/18/us/wreckage-in-the-desert-was-odd-but-not-alien.html),
    which launched long strings of oddly shaped metallic balloons. They were designed
    to monitor Soviet nuclear tests and were highly secret.

    balloons that carried human test dummies ](https://www.britannica.com/event/Roswell-incident)rigged
    with sensors and zipped into [body-sized bags for protection against the elements](https://media.defense.gov/2010/Oct/27/2001330219/-1/-1/0/AFD-101027-030.pdf).
    And there was at least one military plane crash nearby with 11 fatalities.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Echoing earlier government investigations, Kirkpatrick and his team concluded
    that the crashed Mogul balloons, the recovery operations to retrieve downed test
    dummies and glimpses of the charred aftermath of that real plane crash likely
    combined into a single false narrative about a crashed alien spacecraft.

    today. He says new technology taking flight now could help explain a lot of the
    modern era of UFO sightings from the early 2000s on. It’s not just secret government
    technology, either. Lots of observers get [flummoxed](https://www.dni.gov/files/ODNI/documents/assessments/Unclassified-2022-Annual-Report-UAP.pdf)
    when they catch sight of cutting-edge[ drones](https://www.mdpi.com/2504-446X/6/9/260) and [even

    technology that’s being commercialized down in Florida that you didn’t know about, or we
    have extraterrestrials?” he said. “And it even makes me scratch my head more when
    you show them; here’s the company in Florida that builds exactly what you’ve described. And
    their response is, well, no, no, no, it’s gotta be extraterrestrials, and you’re

    they are [flight hazards](https://www.dni.gov/files/ODNI/documents/assessments/Prelimary-Assessment-UAP-20210625.pdf).
    As Kirkpatrick [put it](https://www.grc.nasa.gov/www/k-12/airplane/mach.html),
    “military pilots that are flying at greater than Mach 1; if they run into a balloon
    with a tether on it, it’s going to rip a wing off.”

    the Pentagon has standardized, de-stigmatized and increased the volume of reporting
    on UFOs by the USmilitary. Kirkpatrick says that’s the reason the closely covered
    and [widely-mocked](https://youtu.be/ZNHGHJItFKw?feature=shared&t=90) Chinese [spy
    balloon](https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/04/politics/china-spy-balloon-tick-tock/index.html) was

    government,” Kirkpatrick told us, including the late US Senator Harry Reid, the
    Nevada Democrat who was Senate Majority leader. Another key player was Reid’s
    longtime friend Robert Bigelow, a Nevada billionaire and the owner of a company
    called Bigelow Aerospace, both of whom shared a long-running interest in UFOs.
    Kirkpatrick says, “Senator Harry Reid was a true believer and thought that ‘Hey,
    the government is hiding this from congressional oversight.’”

    the purported physical remains of alien spacecraft. (On “60 Minutes” in May 2017,

    from “some sweetheart deal … it was put out to bid.” Reid also told [The New York
    Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/16/us/politics/pentagon-program-ufo-harry-reid.html), “I’m

    of alien spacecraft. But stories about these secret programs spread inside the

    both deeply weird and richly ironic. Because, for decades, UFO true believers [have

    a US government conspiracy to hide evidence of aliens. But — if you believe Kirkpatrick
    — the more mundane truth is that these stories are being pumped up by a group
    of UFO true believers in and around government.
