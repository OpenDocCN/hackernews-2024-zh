    as a simple case study, but there are even more obvious (and perhaps more useful)
    examples. Consider a graph data structure; a node has edges pointing to other
    nodes, and two nodes can easily point to each other. Who owns whom? Since this
    question cannot be answered at compile-time in the general case, it means we can't
    just use plain Rust references for these "points to" relations. We need to be
    somewhat more clever.

    code samples:'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[PRE4]'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_PRE
- en: For simplicity, the code samples in this post separate the operation on the
    root into a top level function/method, which then calls a recursive method that
    operates at the node level. In this case, `insert_at` takes a link and inserts
    the new data as the child of that node. It preserves the BST invariant (smaller
    implies left child, larger implies right child). The interesting thing to note
    here is the `borrow_mut()` call at the very beginning. It obtains a mutable reference
    from the `RefCell` pointed to by `atnode`. But this isn't just a regular Rust
    mutable reference, as in `&mut`; instead, it's a special type called `std::cell::RefMut`.
    This is where the mutability magic happens - there is no `&mut` in sight, yet
    the code can actually mutate the underlying data .
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To reiterate, this code remains safe; if you attempt to do another `borrow_mut()`
    on the `RefCell` while the previous `RefMut` is in scope, you'll get a run-time
    panic. The safety is guaranteed at run-time.

    and returns a node with the given data, starting from some node:'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[PRE5]'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_PRE
- en: The `.borrow()` call at the beginning is how we ask a `RefCell` to provide a
    immutable reference to the internal data (naturally, this cannot coexist at run-time
    with any mutable references). When we return a node that was found, we `clone`
    the `Rc`, because we need a separate shared owner for the node. This lets Rust
    guarantee that the node cannot just be dropped while the returned `Rc` is still
    alive.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As the full code sample demonstrates, this approach is workable. It takes a
    lot of practice and patience to get right though, at least for inexperienced Rust
    programmers. Since each node is wrapped in three levels of indirection (`Option`,
    `Rc` and `RefCell`) writing the code can be somewhat tricky, since at any point
    you have to remember which level of inderection you're "currently in".
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Another downside of this approach is that getting a plain reference to data
    stored in the tree isn't easy. As you can see in the sample above, the top-level
    `find` method doesn't return the node or its contents, but simply a boolean. This
    isn't great; for example, it makes the `successor` method sub-optimal. The problem
    here is that with `RefCell` we can't just return a regular `&` reference to the
    data, since the `RefCell` must keep a run-time track of all the borrows. We can
    only return a `std::cell::Ref`, but this leaks implementation details. This isn't
    a fatal flaw, but just something to keep in mind while writing code using these
    types.

- en: First, we take some of the safety into our own hands. While this approach won't
    result in corrupted memory, double frees or accessing freed pointers, it can lead
    to run-time panics and other problems because we deal in "raw" indices to a vector.
    Due to bugs, these incides may point past the vector's bounds, or point at the
    wrong slot, etc. For example, nothing prevents us from modifying a slot while
    there are "live handles" to it.

    be that the pointer version is more efficient as well; at the very least, it eschews
    the dynamic borrow checks that `RefCell` does. The flip side is, of course, the
    loss of safety. With the `unsafe` version we can run into all the good-old C memory
