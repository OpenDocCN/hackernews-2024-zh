    a quarter of its population—lived in areas with illegal levels of air pollution;
    areas that also contained nearly 500 of the city’s schools. That same air pollution
    was prematurely killing as many as [36,000 people a year](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/air-pollution-applying-all-our-health/air-pollution-applying-all-our-health#:~:text=The%20annual%20mortality%20of%20human,and%2036,000%20deaths%20every%20year.).
    Much of it was coming from transport: [a quarter](https://www.centreforlondon.org/blog/reimagining-london-transport/)
    of the city’s carbon emissions were from moving people and goods, with three-quarters
    of that emitted by road traffic.'

  zh: 伦敦曾有问题。2016年，该市超过200万居民（约占其总人口四分之一）生活在空气污染超标的地区；这些地区还包括了该市近500所学校。同样的空气污染每年导致多达[36,000人过早死亡](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/air-pollution-applying-all-our-health/air-pollution-applying-all-our-health#:~:text=The%20annual%20mortality%20of%20human,and%2036,000%20deaths%20every%20year.)。这种空气污染很大程度上来自交通：该市碳排放的四分之一来自人员和货物的运输，其中四分之三由道路交通排放。
- en: But in the years since, carbon emissions have fallen. There’s also been a [94
    percent reduction](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/oct/03/dramatic-plunge-in-london-air-pollution-since-2016-report-finds)
    in the number of people living in areas with illegal levels of nitrogen dioxide,
    a pollutant that causes lung damage. The reason? London has spent years and millions
    of pounds reducing the number of motorists in the city.

  zh: 伦敦并不孤单。从奥斯陆到汉堡，从卢布尔雅那到赫尔辛基，欧洲各地的城市已经开始努力减少道路交通，以减少空气污染和气候变化的影响。

    to transition away from cars, has seen sizable reductions in carbon emissions
    and [air pollution](https://www.ljubljana.si/en/news/air-quality-in-ljubljana/)),
    going car-free is a lot harder than it seems. Not only has it led to politicians
    and urban planners facing death threats and being doxxed, it has forced them to
    rethink the entire basis of city life.

- en: London’s car-reduction policies come in a variety of forms. There are charges
    for dirtier vehicles and for driving into the city center. Road layouts in residential
    areas have been redesigned, with one-way systems and bollards, barriers, and planters
    used to reduce through-traffic (creating what are known as “low-traffic neighborhoods”—or
    LTNs). And schemes to get more people cycling and using public transport have
    been introduced. The city has avoided the kind of outright car bans seen elsewhere
    in Europe, such as in Copenhagen, but nevertheless things have changed.

  zh: 伦敦的减少汽车政策采取了多种形式。对污染更严重的车辆和进入市中心的驾驶收取费用。居住区的道路布局进行了重新设计，引入了单向系统和路障、栅栏和花园植物箱，以减少交通流量（形成所谓的“低交通量社区”或LTN）。还推出了增加骑行和使用公共交通的计划。与欧洲其他地方（如哥本哈根）不同，该市避免了全面禁车，但城市的情况仍然发生了变化。
- en: “The level of traffic reduction is transformative, and it’s throughout the whole
    day,” says Claire Holland, leader of the council in Lambeth, a borough in south
    London. Lambeth now sees 25,000 fewer daily car journeys than before its LTN scheme
    was put in place in 2020, even after adjusting for the impact of the pandemic.
    Meanwhile, there was a 40 percent increase in cycling and similar rises in walking
    and scooting over that same period.

  zh: “交通量的减少程度是变革性的，而且是全天候的”，伦敦南部区域兰伯斯的市政领导克莱尔·荷兰说。即使调整了疫情影响，2020年开始实施的LTN计划之后，兰伯斯每天的汽车出行量减少了25,000次。与此同时，自行车使用量增加了40%，步行和滑板车使用量也在同一时期有类似的增长。
- en: What seems to work best is a carrot-and-stick approach—creating positive reasons
    to take a bus or to cycle rather than just making driving harder. “In crowded
    urban areas, you can’t just make buses better if those buses are still always
    stuck in car traffic,” says Rachel Aldred, professor of transport at the University
    of Westminster and director of its Active Travel Academy. “The academic evidence
    suggests that a mixture of positive and negative characteristics is more effective
    than either on their own.”

  zh: 看起来最有效的方法是“胡萝卜加大棒”的方式——创造积极的理由搭公交或骑自行车，而不仅仅是增加驾驶的难度。“在拥挤的城市地区，如果那些公交车仍然总是被汽车交通堵塞，你不能简单地让公交变得更好，”威斯敏斯特大学交通学教授兼其活跃出行学院院长瑞秋·奥尔德雷说。“学术证据表明，积极和消极特征的混合比单独使用任何一种更有效。”
- en: For countries looking to cut emissions, cars are an obvious target. They make
    up a big proportion of a country’s carbon footprint, accounting for [one-fifth
    of all emissions](https://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/headlines/society/20190313STO31218/co2-emissions-from-cars-facts-and-figures-infographics)
    across the European Union. Of course, urban driving doesn’t make up the majority
    of a country’s car use, but the kind of short journeys taken when driving in the
    city are some of the most obviously wasteful, making cities an ideal place to
    start if you’re looking to get people out from behind the wheel. That, and the
    fact that many city residents are already car-less (just 40 percent of people
    in Lambeth own cars, for example) and that cities tend to have better public transport
    alternatives than elsewhere.

  zh: 对于希望减少排放的国家来说，汽车是一个显而易见的目标。它们占据了一个国家碳足迹的很大一部分，欧盟的全部排放中约占五分之一。当然，城市驾驶并不占据一个国家汽车使用的大多数部分，但在城市驾驶时进行的短途旅行往往是最明显的浪费之一，这使得城市成为减少驾驶需求的理想起点。此外，许多城市居民已经没有汽车（例如，兰伯斯只有40%的人拥有汽车），而且城市往往比其他地方拥有更好的公共交通替代方案。
