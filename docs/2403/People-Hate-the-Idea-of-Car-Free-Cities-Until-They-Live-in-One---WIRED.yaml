    a quarter of its population—lived in areas with illegal levels of air pollution;
    areas that also contained nearly 500 of the city’s schools. That same air pollution
    was prematurely killing as many as [36,000 people a year](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/air-pollution-applying-all-our-health/air-pollution-applying-all-our-health#:~:text=The%20annual%20mortality%20of%20human,and%2036,000%20deaths%20every%20year.).
    Much of it was coming from transport: [a quarter](https://www.centreforlondon.org/blog/reimagining-london-transport/)
    of the city’s carbon emissions were from moving people and goods, with three-quarters
    of that emitted by road traffic.'

    percent reduction](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/oct/03/dramatic-plunge-in-london-air-pollution-since-2016-report-finds)
    in the number of people living in areas with illegal levels of nitrogen dioxide,
    a pollutant that causes lung damage. The reason? London has spent years and millions
    of pounds reducing the number of motorists in the city.

    across Europe have started working to reduce their road traffic in an effort to
    curb air pollution and climate change.

    to transition away from cars, has seen sizable reductions in carbon emissions
    and [air pollution](https://www.ljubljana.si/en/news/air-quality-in-ljubljana/)),
    going car-free is a lot harder than it seems. Not only has it led to politicians
    and urban planners facing death threats and being doxxed, it has forced them to
    rethink the entire basis of city life.

    for dirtier vehicles and for driving into the city center. Road layouts in residential
    areas have been redesigned, with one-way systems and bollards, barriers, and planters
    used to reduce through-traffic (creating what are known as “low-traffic neighborhoods”—or
    LTNs). And schemes to get more people cycling and using public transport have
    been introduced. The city has avoided the kind of outright car bans seen elsewhere
    in Europe, such as in Copenhagen, but nevertheless things have changed.

    day,” says Claire Holland, leader of the council in Lambeth, a borough in south
    London. Lambeth now sees 25,000 fewer daily car journeys than before its LTN scheme
    was put in place in 2020, even after adjusting for the impact of the pandemic.
    Meanwhile, there was a 40 percent increase in cycling and similar rises in walking
    and scooting over that same period.

    to take a bus or to cycle rather than just making driving harder. “In crowded
    urban areas, you can’t just make buses better if those buses are still always
    stuck in car traffic,” says Rachel Aldred, professor of transport at the University
    of Westminster and director of its Active Travel Academy. “The academic evidence
    suggests that a mixture of positive and negative characteristics is more effective
    than either on their own.”

    up a big proportion of a country’s carbon footprint, accounting for [one-fifth
    of all emissions](https://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/headlines/society/20190313STO31218/co2-emissions-from-cars-facts-and-figures-infographics)
    across the European Union. Of course, urban driving doesn’t make up the majority
    of a country’s car use, but the kind of short journeys taken when driving in the
    city are some of the most obviously wasteful, making cities an ideal place to
    start if you’re looking to get people out from behind the wheel. That, and the
    fact that many city residents are already car-less (just 40 percent of people
    in Lambeth own cars, for example) and that cities tend to have better public transport
    alternatives than elsewhere.
