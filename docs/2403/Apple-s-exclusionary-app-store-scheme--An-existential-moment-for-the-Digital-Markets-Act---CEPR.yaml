- en: The Digital Markets Act (DMA) comes into full force in the European Union on
    7 March. Article 6(4) requires Apple to permit third-party app stores to distribute
    apps on its iOS devices. After explaining why this requirement is important, we
    show that there are good reasons to believe that Apple’s proposed approach to
    compliance will not meet the objectives of the DMA, and most probably impede entry
    by rival stores as well as stifle innovation.

- en: The DMA’s requirement that Apple offer its users the choice of using alternative
    app stores reflects the importance of such stores for driving quality and innovation.
    In recent years, the number of apps that users have been installing on their handsets
    has declined. This is the case despite the increasing number of applications of
    all kinds that make a handset more useful. Among the reasons for this decline
    could be the low quality of the discovery process and the lack of innovation in
    distribution. All apps are distributed through one large monopoly store that has
    limited functionality; finding an app involves searching through millions of apps
    using the store’s search function, the resulting recommendations are themselves
    distorted by advertising; and the store is not tailored to the needs of particular
    apps or users.

    and store variety are needed. Rival app stores could improve the user experience
    in curation and search by carrying only a subset of apps and offering users a
    different value proposition. Rival stores could be run by a large corporation
    with a particular business model, such as Disney in curation of apps for children,
    Pinterest in curation of apps for creativity, or American Express in distribution
    of apps for frequent travellers. New models of stores could spring up – for instance,
    a store which would offer a discount for subscription to multiple online newspapers,
    or a store run by a government with helpful apps for its citizens. Rival stores
    could also simply compete by charging lower fees to developers.

    devices to entry by third-party app stores at a technical level. However, it has

    of the new scheme proposed by Apple. It will be possible for app developers to
    continue to benefit from the same terms that are currently offered by Apple. At
    first sight, this seems uncontroversial and a good way to ensure that there are
    no losers from the introduction of the new tariffs.  However, the old terms will
    *only* be available for apps distributed *exclusively* through the Apple app store.
    For any app wishing to use an alternative app store, the new tariffs apply. These
    include a minimum fee of, effectively, €0.50 per user per year. As we will see,
    this will generally act to stifle the development of attractive alternative app
    stores.

    not to carry: gambling, pornography, and some forms of unsavoury dating. These
    entrants may establish a bad reputation for all alternative app stores in the

    category, we include apps that are used by companies like banks, physical stores,
    and so on, to connect to their customers as well as apps that sell non-physical
    goods and are therefore not subject to the current App store fee such as those
    of Amazon, Deliveroo, and Uber. In the second category are content apps supported

    reach their end users through iOS. As discussed above, it will be possible for
    such app developers to continue to benefit from the same terms. However, if they
    choose to distribute through an alternative store they must choose the new terms
    of the Apple store, which in turn means they will have to pay €0.50 per user per
    year. Moreover, *this fee is calculated on all installs regardless of the app
    store in which the downloads occur*. That is, the app developer must now pay €0.50
    for each of the Apple App Store users it previously served for free.

    iOS. If Deliveroo exclusively distributes through the Apple App Store after 7
    March, it can stay on the existing tariff and continue to pay nothing. Suppose,
    however, that Deliveroo wants to access users in a gaming store that has agreed
    to promote the food delivery company in an innovative way. In that case Deliveroo
    must move to the new Apple terms. When Deliveroo offers its app in this rival
    store, the company will have to pay €0.50 for every user (after the first million)
    that it serves through the Apple App Store as well as for every user downloading
    the app through the alternative gaming store. With this scheme Apple has placed
    a new distribution charge on downloads through the Apple App Store – but *only
    if the developer patronises a rival of Apple’s store* (Scott Morton and Abrahamson
    2016).
  id: totrans-split-21

- en: The Apple pricing scheme effectively means that any app developer with millions
    of existing downloads will become liable for a very substantial annual fee to
    Apple the moment it decides to work with a rival app store. In economic terms,
    therefore, Apple has ‘taxed’ its rivals’ entry. When a rival app store is nascent
    and has an uncertain future, the developer will likely not gain that much initially
    from distributing through the store. Apple’s effective tax on such popular apps
    using a rival store is thus likely to deter them from doing so.

    to the previous terms (namely, zero cost of distribution in the Apple App Store).
    Therefore, the developer is not only facing a significantly increased cost for
    its distribution through the Apple App Store, but one that it cannot reverse –
    despite the significant risk. The rules therefore create a very substantial disincentive
    for apps that have a large installed base in the Apple App Store to even experiment
    with a new entrant.

    will make entry by a new entrant app store very much harder. New app stores ¬will
    need to offer some, or even several, of these existing popular apps to build credibility,
    grow, and begin to develop their own network effects. We see this phenomenon of
    needing at least a few ‘big names’ in retail settings where particular brands
    or ‘anchor stores’ play an outsize role in attracting users. More generalist stores
    will need popular apps to create an appealing value proposition to end users,
    and this may also be true for specialist stores. Without the biggest social media,
    finance, e-commerce, and transportation apps, any alternative app store specialising
    in that arena will be limited to catering to very niche tastes. In this environment,
    rival app stores will have a hard time contesting Apple’s monopoly position.

    will not be attractive to an alternative app store anyway because the fees they
    can charge will need to be close to zero – which cannot cover the costs of the
    alternative store. This, too, is over-simplistic. Of course, a rival generalist
    store needs to earn revenue in some way. But we have seen that these apps would
    likely bring benefits beyond any app store fees they pay. There may also be the
    potential for some app stores to enter as part of a wider business proposition
    of a bigger brand, and are therefore not intended to be profitable in their own
    right. Moreover, this is not Apple’s decision to make; it is up to the entrant
    to choose its business model and value proposition, and it should do so without
    interference from the incumbent monopolist.

    app stores depends on the independent choices of a wide group of app developers.
    In aggregate, they would gain from a coordinated move to higher-quality and more
    innovative app stores, since this would allow these app stores to quickly build
    their credibility with end users and benefit from network effects. But each developer,
    acting alone, will not wish to make that move until others do. And there is no
    potential for the ‘winners’ in this process to subsidise any ‘losers’. Thus, app
    developers face a coordination problem. Apple’s pricing scheme exacerbates that
    coordination problem, which will in turn favour its own App store. Overall, Apple’s
    rules may constitute a violation under Article 8 of the DMA, as their effect is
    to circumvent contestability in app stores on iOS (Salop and Scheffman 1983).

    app developers that currently pay a 30% commission on sales of digital goods will
    be able to access lower rates (20%, see Table 1), or move to third-party app stores
    that compete by offering lower commissions. However, these changes will still
    trigger the €0.50 annual fixed fee per user, and thus many such apps may well
    still be worse off under the new terms. This is likely to include many popular
    ‘freemium’ apps which have a large installed base, and currently cover their costs
    by upselling in app purchases to a small proportion of those users. Under the
    new terms, the new €0.50 fee per user may well outweigh the reduced upselling
    commissions.

    stores (unless they can formalise all of their curation decisions within published
    criteria). Both of these categories of app store would seem to be useful innovations
    that end users would likely value. We see no reason why they should be arbitrarily
    forbidden, nor do we understand why it is legitimate for Apple to impose business
    models on alternative app stores.
