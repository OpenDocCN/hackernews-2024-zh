- en: As we discussed in our popular book, *Microsoft's Art of Stock Price Manipulation
    and How to Protect Yourself*, the world’s largest company is actually the world’s
    largest **holding** company. That is the big transformation under present Chairman
    and CEO Satya Nadella.

- en: Satya Nadella who has gutted out the entire company and deprioritized the company’s
    crown jewels which give it recall value has also lost good talent by creating
    a dangerously toxic environment filled with professionally less capable yes men
    and women throughout the company.

- en: Nadella who was search of a glue that will prevent the company from going in
    a hundred different directions for each division felt that well known AI non-profit
    OpenAI is that glue. Hence, he made OpenAI’s technology central to each and every
    Microsoft product under the brand name Copilot. To achieve this, he made the non-profit
    discard its founding principles of being Open (as in open sourcing everything
    they create) and work for better of humanity and move to being Closed (where company
    does not share its program code and logic with the world) and works exclusively
    for further enrichment of the world’s largest company – Microsoft.

- en: Elon Musk, one of the founding fathers and funders of OpenAI, has filed a lawsuit
    which threatens to expose Nadella and OpenAI’s controversial agreements and accounts
    for the world to see and force OpenAI back to honouring the founding agreement
    upon which it was created.

- en: This lawsuit explains why Nadella’s Microsoft recently announced a partnership
    with French AI Company, Mistral – because OpenAI is about to be put in the dock
    and under the magnifying glass slowing down the company’s progress -, and why
    Musk was poking around with Windows 11 in the weeks prior to the lawsuit – he
    wanted to see Windows Copilot in action to bolster his claims in the lawsuit.
    Once this happens, the glue that OpenAI’s Copilot was supposed to be evaporates.
    Nadella’s Microsoft should reset back to its rightful valuation which as we have
    said – is just a fraction of what it current is.

    in its usage of language. Clearly, Elon Musk wanted everybody to read and understand
    the lawsuit and its contents, considering that the technology under question –
    Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) - affects the entire of humanity.
