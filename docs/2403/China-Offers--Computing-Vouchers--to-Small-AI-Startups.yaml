    Monday, at least 17 cities have committed to offering “computing vouchers” for
    startups to help them pay for increasing data center costs amid a shortage of
    the type of chips that are vital to the artificial intelligence (AI) sector.

    and $280,000, and can be used for time in AI data centers where companies can
    train and run large language models (LLMs).

    companies with cloud computing services voided their contracts. That was because
    tougher measures in the U.S. led them to “hog the GPUs [graphics processing units]
    for themselves,” as one AI founder told the Financial Times.

    that tech giants have taken steps to limit the rental of [Nvidia’s](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/) GPUs
    and have reserved most of these stockpiled AI processors for in-house use and
    key clients.

    China’s access to AI chips, which has led companies to either stockpile chips
    or repurpose Nvidia gaming chips or resort to the black market, the report said.

    which OpenAI and other AI companies rely has been a concern for the companies,”
    PYMNTS wrote last month. “Nvidia currently dominates the chip market with a global
    market share of greater than 80%.”

    and placed it at “the center of a generative AI revolution that quite literally
    cannot run without its products,” as reported here.

    call. “The year ahead will bring major new product cycles with exceptional innovations
    to help propel our industry forward.”

- en: That report noted that, given China’s status as the world’s largest producer
    of AI research, its oversight of the industry “will certainly add necessary context
    around the underlying structures and technical feasibility of different regulatory
    approaches.”
