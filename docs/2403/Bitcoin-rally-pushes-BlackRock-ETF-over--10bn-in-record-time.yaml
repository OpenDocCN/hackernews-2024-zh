    January 11 launch to reach that landmark, beating Invesco QQQ’s record of just
    over a year, according to Morningstar. IBIT’s total assets now sit at around $12.7bn,
    a combination of bitcoin’s appreciation and more than $7bn in net inflows.

    mid-January launch through the end of February, including $8.5bn that investors
    have withdrawn from the $27.5bn Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF (GBTC), according
    to data from Morningstar Direct. The Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin ETF has amassed
    about $7.6bn in assets, putting it in position to be the second-fastest to reach

    who were “trapped inside GBTC” and have exited the priciest bitcoin ETF in favour
    of a less costly alternative, said Dave Nadig, a longtime ETF observer who has
    been studying bitcoin ETF trading patterns.

- en: GBTC had a head start on bitcoin ETF assets since it launched over a decade
    ago, in a structure that made it difficult for investors to exit easily. But investors
    have been leaving the fund and its 1.5 per cent management fee now that they can
    more efficiently transfer their holdings to lower-cost alternatives, some of which
    have waived their fees entirely.

    so positive that the net assets in Grayscale’s ETF have nearly recovered since

    the $10bn threshold in about two years, according to Morningstar. State Street’s
