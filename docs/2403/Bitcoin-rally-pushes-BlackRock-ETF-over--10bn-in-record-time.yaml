    US ETF in history, fuelled by a rally that continues to send the world’s largest
    cryptocurrency to record heights.

- en: BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) needed less than two months from its
    January 11 launch to reach that landmark, beating Invesco QQQ’s record of just
    over a year, according to Morningstar. IBIT’s total assets now sit at around $12.7bn,
    a combination of bitcoin’s appreciation and more than $7bn in net inflows.

    mid-January launch through the end of February, including $8.5bn that investors
    have withdrawn from the $27.5bn Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF (GBTC), according
    to data from Morningstar Direct. The Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin ETF has amassed
    about $7.6bn in assets, putting it in position to be the second-fastest to reach
    $10bn after its iShares peer.

- en: Much of the recent investments in the bitcoin ETFs appear to be from investors
    who were “trapped inside GBTC” and have exited the priciest bitcoin ETF in favour
    of a less costly alternative, said Dave Nadig, a longtime ETF observer who has
    been studying bitcoin ETF trading patterns.

    result of high-frequency traders, Nadig said. “It’s just algo players trying to
    scalp pennies.”

    in bitcoin ETFs and the potential for arbitrage, the bulk of new assets moving
    BlackRock’s new cryptocurrency products appear to be from retail investors.

    crypto through their tax-advantaged retirement accounts and brokerage accounts,”

- en: GBTC had a head start on bitcoin ETF assets since it launched over a decade
    ago, in a structure that made it difficult for investors to exit easily. But investors
    have been leaving the fund and its 1.5 per cent management fee now that they can
    more efficiently transfer their holdings to lower-cost alternatives, some of which
    have waived their fees entirely.

    we intend to make it a competitive product over time,” Pandl said.

- en: The rally following the SEC’s long-awaited spot bitcoin ETF approval has been
    so positive that the net assets in Grayscale’s ETF have nearly recovered since
    its conversion, which allowed long-term holders to exit and take profits from
    bitcoin’s massive rise over the past decade.

    the $10bn threshold in about two years, according to Morningstar. State Street’s
    SPDR Gold Shares ETF (GLD), which launched in late 2004, was also relatively quick
    to hit $10bn, clearing that mark in early 2007\.

    “The probability that this goes to zero is way less, particularly after the SEC
    approving these ETFs, which takes away some of the downside risk,” he said.

    Wisdom Tree, Valkyrie and Franklin Templeton have fared less well, according to

    as most of its peers, “it’s actually been one of our more successful ETF launches,
    even though we’re not taking in an iShares level of volume”, said Will Peck, WisdomTree’s
    head of digital assets.

    “I was expecting it to be kind of a ‘buy the rumour, sell the news’ sort of situation,
    but it shows how hard it is to know anything with this asset class.”
