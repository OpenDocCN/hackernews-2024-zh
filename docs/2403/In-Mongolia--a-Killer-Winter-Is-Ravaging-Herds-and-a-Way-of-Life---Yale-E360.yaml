    a wife and two children, woke to the howling winds outside his “ger,” a felt-covered
    traditional Mongolian dwelling. Sensing something amiss, he hurriedly put on his
    heavy fur coat and noted that another blanket of snow had fallen during the night.
    Then he shoveled his way outside.

    were no trails either. He realized that his prized herd, which he had raised from
    birth with his aunt and uncle, was under more than 3 feet of snow. All had frozen

    coats of fur, and pawing through snow and ice to grasses. But this winter, herds
    are struggling through both a “white” dzud, in which very deep snow hinders their
    access to grass, and an “iron” dzud, in which a brief thaw is followed by a rapid,
    hard freeze, locking pastures in ice.

    severe.” Scientists say that climate change is reshaping winter weather, leading
    to more extremes. Masses of frigid Arctic air are increasingly extending down
    over Mongolia, which is also seeing more snow. And the snow is falling all at

    to buy food and pay their children’s school and university fees. Because of the
    loss of animals this winter, thousands of people have fallen into poverty.

    One factor may be a weakening of the polar jet stream, a narrow band of fast-flowing
    wind circling the Earth. The jet stream is formed by the collision of cold, Arctic
    air with warmer air to the south, but with [climate change](https://news.yale.edu/2022/09/12/meandering-waves-connect-jet-streams-global-warming),
    the Arctic is warming faster than other regions, narrowing the difference in temperature.
    This results in a weaker, more meandering jet stream that is allowing frigid polar
    air to reach down into Mongolia, Batjargal says.

    that Mongolia is “extremely prone” to natural disasters, and the situation for
    herders is likely to worsen in the years to come. Even if the world stays on track
    for around 2 degrees C of warming, dzuds are projected to strike up to [20 percent](https://www.unescap.org/sites/default/d8files/event-documents/Mongolia%20-%20Climate%20Change%20and%20Disaster%20Risk%20Profile.pdf#page=12)

    the ones they knew would not make it through the coming disaster. The oversupply
    of meat resulted in significant price drops, compounding herders’ challenges.
    However, regardless of preparation, the effects of a dzud of this magnitude cannot
    be mitigated. “For countrywide dzud events,” the IPCC reports, “high levels of
    livestock mortality are often unavoidable, even for the most experienced herders.”

    of $340,000 in loans taken by nomads. But long-term adaptation strategies are
    still lacking. In the past, the government has, after supplying immediate relief,
    helped herders restock. However, the IPCC has suggested this approach is costly,
    relatively inefficient, and may fail to provide incentives for herders to minimize
    livestock mortality. “Restocking in areas with drought, poor pasture condition,
    and [with] unfit animals can actually increase livestock vulnerability in the
    following year as a result of greater competition for scarce resources,” the IPCC
    said. Still, temporary relief programs continue, and Mongolia’s agricultural ministry
