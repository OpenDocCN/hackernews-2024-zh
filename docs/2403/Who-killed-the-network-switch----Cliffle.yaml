    many bugs, it wasn’t a bug when it was originally written — correct code *became*
    a bug as other things changed around it.

    an interesting window into our development process around Hubris. It’s very rare
    for us to find a bug in the Hubris kernel, mostly because it’s so small. So I
    jumped at the opportunity to write this one down.

    on our network switches at Oxide. He was testing a change he’d made to power sequencing
    and clock configuration — the very important bits that are responsible for turning
    everything else on. After a seemingly innocuous change, suddenly, the switch wouldn’t
    power on.

    important part — the power supply sequencer — seemed to be dead in its tracks.
    Without power, the network switch was just a rather large, very heavy paperweight.

- en: Squeezing more out of limited RAM
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: On the relatively inexpensive microcontrollers we use with Hubris, one of the
    challenges is that RAM (and flash, for storing code) is quite limited. For instance,
    we have an internal board that serves as a useful I2C debugging probe and has
    8 kiB of RAM and 32 kiB of flash. The system you’re reading this on, even if it’s
    an inexpensive phone, might have a million times that.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Hubris faces this challenge a bit more than other operating systems in our niche,
    because firmware using Hubris is built out of many separately-compiled programs
    called *tasks.* Each task gets its own copy of everything it needs, including
    common standard library code. This means our systems tend to have somewhat higher
    resource requirements than others (though not by as much as you might expect —
    this will be the topic of another post).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We isolate tasks from each other using the hardware memory protection unit,
    which keeps them from crashing or corrupting each other. This adds some pressure
    on our RAM and flash requirements, though. In the ARM microcontrollers that we
    mostly use to run Hubris — the older members of the Cortex-M family, aka the ARMv7-M
    architecture — any protected region of memory has to be a *power of two* in size,
    and aligned according to its size. This means if you have a region that is currently
    1024 bytes, and you need one more byte, you can’t just grow it to 1025 — it is
    now 2048 bytes whether you like it or not.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Originally, Hubris used one memory protection region for a task’s RAM, and one
    for its flash. Simple, but wasteful. This encouraged [fragmentation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fragmentation_(computing)),
    which in practice meant that there was often unused RAM and flash left between
    tasks that didn’t quite line up. That unused memory was basically wasted. This
    is really frustrating when you don’t have enough of it to begin with!

    each task to no more than eight regions, total.) In some of our firmware images,
    this recovered 30% of RAM! Our smallest devices went from being so crammed full
    that I regularly had to make optimization passes over the code, to having free

    Communication scheme, or IPC. Each message looks and behaves very much like a
    function call: the task sending the message stops, the task receiving it takes
    control of the CPU, and eventually returns some result that causes the sender
    to wake back up.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We chose this scheme for a bunch of reasons — there are, after all, many other
    options! — but one of the most useful ones is that it plays nicely with Rust’s
    resources ownership model. Just as a function can loan some memory it controls
    to a function it calls, and reliably get ownership back when the function returns,
    a task on Hubris can loan some of its memory to another task along with an IPC
    message.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This feature is very widely used in Hubris-based firmware. For example, tasks
    that want to interact with an I2C device loan sections of their memory to the
    I2C bus driver, which then reads and/or writes them in-place. This keeps the bus
    driver itself from needing to have a buffer pool or similar resource internally,
    and reduces the number of copies needed to move data from place to place.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It’s also a potential security hole if implemented incorrectly. Much of Hubris’s
    reliability comes from the *isolation* of tasks; tasks don’t share any memory,
    so one task can do arbitrarily silly things in its own space without hurting any
    other tasks. So it’s very important that loaning memory via IPC doesn’t let tasks
    break out of their isolated containers.
  prefs: []

    it’s forbidden by the Hubris kernel.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    discovered, the server is handed an apologetic error code by the kernel, while
    the client receives a fault. To the server, this is never fatal; to the client,
    it is *always fatal.* We assume that the access violation indicates a bug, corruption,
    or exploit in the sending task, so we immediately shut it down without giving
    it an opportunity to respond.

- en: The kernel distinguishes between *real* and *synthetic* faults. A real fault
    happens when a task does something simple and wrong, such as dereferencing a null
    pointer, or trying to write to its code region. Real faults are generated by the
    hardware (in this case, the memory protection unit) in response to actions performed
    by a task. As a result, they can only happen when the task is actually running
    and doing something wrong.
  prefs: []

    rules. The processor has no concept of “IPC” or “loaning memory across tasks,”
    those are ideas that Hubris added to the system. They have their own rules, and
    if a task violates them, we treat it just like a null pointer dereference or other
    “real” hardware fault — just with a different set of fault information that marks
    it as synthetic.

    take a self-contained snapshot of the service processor, which he posted in a
    chat channel for Matt and I to pore over.'

    crashing network switch, and in fact I’m not actually sure where in the country
    it’s located. It doesn’t really matter; Humility can dump a consistent snapshot
    of our embedded systems when *at least one person* has physical access, and Hubris
    itself records compressed coredumps of crashing tasks into RAM where we can retrieve
    them over the network. This means we can still get crash dumps despite not having
    writable persistent storage, such as flash.'

    kernel are simple — so simple, in fact, that I was initially concerned that they
    couldn’t be used to make useful production firmware. (Thankfully I was wrong!)
    The IPC mechanism has only three operations and no optional or fancy parts, so
    when a fault points to IPC, there are not a lot of places you might need to hunt
    for the problem.'

    part of the Hubris kernel is currently 1,789 lines of code. That’s about four
    copies of this post. In a pinch, a single person could read through the entire
    kernel in search of a bug.

    to!

    but it’s hard to separate Hubris from the team that built it. Oxide’s engineering
    team has essentially no internal silos. Our culture rewards openness, curiosity,
    and communication, and discourages defensiveness, empire-building, and gatekeeping.
    We’ve worked hard to create and defend this culture, and I think it shows in the
    way we organized horizontally, across the borders of what other organizations
    would call teams, to solve this mystery.'

    fixed the bug in my place — if not me it would have been Matt, or Laura Abbott,
    or Eliza, or Arjen, or Bryan, or any of several other people. This is really important
    to me. They would have done so without fear of reprisal; at most, they might have
    done it slightly slower, since I wrote the original buggy code and knew where
    the bodies were buried — but not dramatically slower. There is a real benefit
    to keeping critical code simple, well-commented, easy to reason about, and accessible
    — and there’s a real benefit to maintaining a team culture where *everyone* can
    take advantage of that.

    more software folk. For details, [see the job description on our site](https://oxide.computer/careers/software-engineer).
