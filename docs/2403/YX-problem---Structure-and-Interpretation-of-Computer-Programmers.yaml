    to do X when what they’re really trying to solve is Y. I find the YX problem much
    more frustrating: where software people decide that they want to answer question
    Y even though what someone asks is question X.'

    would be, and ends up answering Y.

    should be trying Y instead; respondent didn’t ask querent the context for X but
    jumped straight to answering Y.

    to enumerate the steps of that process Y; even though they know that the querent
    is already trying X.

- en: 'The common advice on questions for software people is [How to ask questions
    the smart way](http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html). The problem with
    this advice is that it’s written from the perspective of an asymmetric relationship:
    the respondent is a busy expert, the querent is an idle dilettante; the querent
    has a responsibility to frame their question in the optimum way for the expert
    to impart wisdom to the idler.'

- en: 'Frequently the situation is more symmetric: we’re both busy experts, and we
    both have incomplete knowledge of both the question domain and what we’re trying
    to achieve. Have some patience with other people (whichever side of the interaction
    you’re on), and assume good faith on the part of all involved until they present
    contrary evidence. That means starting from the assumption that someone asked
    question X because they want an answer to question X.'
