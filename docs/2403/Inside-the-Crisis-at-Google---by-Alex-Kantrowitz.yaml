    I remember sitting in the audience in January 2018 when the Google CEO said it
    was [as profound as electricity and fire](https://www.vox.com/2018/1/19/16911180/sundar-pichai-google-fire-electricity-ai).
    His proclamation stunned the San Francisco audience that day, so bullish it still
    seems a bit absurd, and it underscores how bizarre it is that his AI strategy
    now appears unmoored.'

    tool produced insane responses, including portraying Nazis as people of color
    — is now spiraling into the worst moment of Pichai’s tenure. Morale at Google
    is plummeting, with one employee telling me it’s the worst he’s ever seen. And
    more people are calling for Pichai’s ouster than ever before. Even the relatively
    restrained Ben Thompson of Stratechery [demanded](https://stratechery.com/2024/gemini-and-googles-culture/?access_token=eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsImtpZCI6InN0cmF0ZWNoZXJ5LnBhc3Nwb3J0Lm9ubGluZSIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJhdWQiOiJzdHJhdGVjaGVyeS5wYXNzcG9ydC5vbmxpbmUiLCJhenAiOiJIS0xjUzREd1Nod1AyWURLYmZQV00xIiwiZW50Ijp7InVyaSI6WyJodHRwczovL3N0cmF0ZWNoZXJ5LmNvbS8yMDI0L2dlbWluaS1hbmQtZ29vZ2xlcy1jdWx0dXJlLyJdfSwiZXhwIjoxNzExNTU0NDk0LCJpYXQiOjE3MDg5NjI0OTQsImlzcyI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXBpLnBhc3Nwb3J0Lm9ubGluZS9vYXV0aCIsInNjb3BlIjoiZmVlZDpyZWFkIGFydGljbGU6cmVhZCBhc3NldDpyZWFkIGNhdGVnb3J5OnJlYWQgZW50aXRsZW1lbnRzIiwic3ViIjoiNWNXa1ZwODhLR2p2TGY1OFZzMVBZNiIsInVzZSI6ImFjY2VzcyJ9.OphIHgANCaGJLTv5Ck6i4i_xLdxuioJejehFj8Ed-h6BXJVhWLW5Sx9u_Gy0NqhjVs7ddre-ShsrbGg45W6srsWc50DJGeboUrPTY7_05fCYYfBsBUi_Lf6Dc0a5Ff8Gy1AjCRavP-PWscr_eyK_YVi4Q7O1cg58NuETpEOyj71l1IIToHjk7TgieC7YN9y1CjqwfnuiBRTwBdGuII7XDmZAun6Rd_96SPK7ihofvlLUNM8tLsyHsqDSR7JUwnsyzx1UHXb9g1EE48kc4zF3YR1Azs2IRS06We0sLCcOchx-1edUntyaVn2hVeAd3UOph-2m5rZog9O5rTcWhx__zg)

    the culture war lens. For many, Google either [caved to wokeness](https://www.businessinsider.com/google-gemini-woke-images-ai-chatbot-criticism-controversy-2024-2)
    or cowed to those who’d prefer [not to address AI bias](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2024-02-28/google-s-gemini-ai-isn-t-too-woke-it-s-too-rushed).
    These interpretations are wanting, and frankly incomplete explanations for why
    the crisis escalated to this point. The culture war narrative gives too much credit
    to Google for being a well organized, politics-driven machine. And the magnitude
    of the issue runs even deeper than Gemini’s skewed responses.

- en: There’s now little doubt that Google steered its users’ Gemini prompts by adding
    words that pushed the outputs toward diverse responses — forgetting when *not*
    to ask for diversity, like with the Nazis — but the way those added words got
    there is the real story. Even employees on Google’s Trust and Safety team are
    puzzled by where exactly the words came from, a product of Google scrambling to
    set up a Gemini unit without clear ownership of critical capabilities. And a reflection
    of the lack of accountability within some parts of Google.

    for failure.”'

- en: Organizational dysfunction is still common within Google, something it’s worked
    to fix through recent layoffs, and it showed up in the formation of its Gemini
    team. Moving fast while chasing OpenAI and Microsoft, Google gave its Product,
    Trust and Safety, and Responsible AI teams input into the training and release
    of Gemini. And their coordination clearly wasn’t good enough. In his letter to
    Google employees addressing the Gemini debacle this week, Pichai singled out “structural
    changes” as a remedy to prevent a repeat, acknowledging the failure.
  id: totrans-split-11
  prefs: []

    operates. “The problem is big enough that replacing a single leader or merging
    just two teams probably won’t cut it,” the Google Trust and Safety employee said.

    to the mess. On Friday, a ‘reset’ day Google, and through the weekend — when Google
    employees almost never work — the company’s Trust and Safety leadership called
    for volunteers to test Gemini’s outputs to prevent further blunders. “We need
    multiple volunteers on stand-by per time block so we can activate rapid adversarial
    testing on high priority topics,” one executive wrote in an internal email.

- en: And as the crisis brewed internally, it escalated externally when Google shared
    the same type of opaque public statements and pledges about doing better that
    have worked for its core products. That underestimated how different the public’s
    relationship is with generative AI than other technology, and made matters worse.
  id: totrans-split-15

- en: Unlike search, which points you to the web, generative AI is the core experience,
    not a route elsewhere. Using a generative tool like Gemini is a tradeoff. You
    get the benefit of a seemingly-magical product. But you give up control. While
    you may get answers quickly, or a cool looking graphic, you lose touch with the
    source material. To use it means putting more trust in giant companies like Google,
    and to maintain that trust Google needs to be extremely transparent. Yet what
    do we really know about how its models operate? Continuing on as it if were business
    as usual, Google contributed to the magnitude of the crisis.

- en: Now, some close to Google are starting to ask if it’s focused in the right places,
    coming back to Pichai’s strategic plan. Was it really necessary, for instance,
    for Google to build a $20 per month chatbot, when it could simply imbue its existing
    technology — including Gmail, Docs, and its Google Home smart speakers — with
    AI?
  id: totrans-split-17

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There are all worthwhile questions, and the open wondering about Pichai’s job
    is fair, but the current wave of Generative AI is still so early that Google has
    time to adjust. On Friday, for instance, Elon Musk sued OpenAI for betraying its
    founding agreement, a potential setback for the company’s main competitor.

    a few more shots until a true moment for panic sets in. But everyone within the
    company knows it can’t afford many more of the previous week’s incidents, from
    Pichai to the workers pulling shifts this weekend.
