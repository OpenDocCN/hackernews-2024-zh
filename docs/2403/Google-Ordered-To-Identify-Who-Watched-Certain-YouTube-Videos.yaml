- en: Federal investigators have ordered Google to provide information on all viewers
    of select YouTube videos, according to multiple court orders obtained by *Forbes*.
    Privacy experts from multiple civil rights groups told *Forbes* they think the
    orders are unconstitutional because they threaten to turn innocent YouTube viewers
    into criminal suspects.

    sought to identify the individual behind the online moniker “elonmuskwhm,” who
    they suspect of buying bitcoin for cash, potentially running afoul of money laundering
    laws and rules around unlicensed money transmitting.

    of YouTube tutorials for mapping via drones and augmented reality software, then
    asked Google for information on who had viewed the videos, which collectively
    have been watched over 30,000 times.

- en: The court orders show the government telling Google to provide the names, addresses,
    telephone numbers and user activity for all Google account users who accessed
    the YouTube videos between January 1 and January 8, 2023\. The government also
    wanted the IP addresses of non-Google account owners who viewed the videos. The
    cops argued, “There is reason to believe that these records would be relevant
    and material to an ongoing criminal investigation, including by providing identification
    information about the perpetrators.”

    Police received a threat from an unknown male that an explosive had been placed
    in a trashcan in a public area. The order says that after the police searched
    the area, they learned they were being watched over a YouTube live stream camera
    associated with a local business. Federal investigators believe similar events
    have happened across the U.S., where bomb threats were made and cops watched via
    YouTube.

    to provide a list of accounts that “viewed and/or interacted with” eight YouTube
    live streams and the associated identifying information during specific timeframes.
    That included a video posted by Boston and Maine Live, which has 130,000 subscribers.
    Mike McCormack, who set up the company behind the account, IP Time Lapse, said
    he knew about the order, adding that they related "to swatting incidents directed
    at the camera views at that time."

    push back against overbroad or otherwise inappropriate demands for user data,

    to undo protections in the 1st and 4th Amendments covering free speech and freedom
    from unreasonable searches. “This is the latest chapter in a disturbing trend
    where we see government agencies increasingly transforming search warrants into
    digital dragnets. It’s unconstitutional, it’s terrifying and it’s happening every
    day,” said Albert Fox-Cahn, executive director at the Surveillance Technology
    Oversight Project. “No one should fear a knock at the door from police simply
    because of what the YouTube algorithm serves up. I’m horrified that the courts
    are allowing this.”

    has been ordered to provide data on all users in the vicinity of a crime. Google
    announced [an update in December](https://www.forbes.com/sites/cyrusfarivar/2023/12/14/google-just-killed-geofence-warrants-police-location-data/
    "https://www.forbes.com/sites/cyrusfarivar/2023/12/14/google-just-killed-geofence-warrants-police-location-data/")
    that will make it technically impossible for the tech giant to provide information
    in response to geofence orders. Prior to that, a California court had [ruled](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2023/04/first-us-appellate-court-decide-finds-geofence-warrant-unconstitutional
    "https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2023/04/first-us-appellate-court-decide-finds-geofence-warrant-unconstitutional")
    that a geofence warrant covering several densely-populated areas in Los Angeles
    was unconstitutional, leading to hopes the courts would stop police seeking the
    data.

    our passions, our religious beliefs, and much more,” said John Davisson, senior
    counsel at the Electronic Privacy Information Center. “It's fair to expect that
    law enforcement won't have access to that information without probable cause.
    This order turns that assumption on its head.”
