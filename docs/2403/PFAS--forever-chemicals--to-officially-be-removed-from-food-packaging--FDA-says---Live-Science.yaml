    the agency declared that grease-proofing materials that contain [per- and polyfluoroalkyl
    substances](https://www.livescience.com/65364-pfas.html) (PFAS) will not be used
    in new food packaging sold in the U.S. These include PFAS used in fast-food wrappers,
    microwave popcorn bags, takeout boxes and pet food bags. The FDA's announcement
    marks the completion of a voluntary phase-out of the materials by U.S. food packaging
    manufacturers.

    Jones](https://www.fda.gov/about-fda/fda-organization/jim-jones), deputy commissioner
    for human foods at the FDA, said in an associated [statement](https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-industry-actions-end-sales-pfas-used-us-food-packaging).
    Companies told the FDA that it could take up to 18 months to completely exhaust
    the market supply of these products following their final date of sale. However,
    most of the affected manufacturers phased out the products faster than they initially
    predicted, the agency noted.

    which is why they've historically been used in a wide variety of products, including
    food packaging, household cleaners and nonstick cookware. PFAS are super durable
    chemicals that can [take years to break down](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7657368/),

    through their diets, there are also "many sources of PFAS in our environment,"
