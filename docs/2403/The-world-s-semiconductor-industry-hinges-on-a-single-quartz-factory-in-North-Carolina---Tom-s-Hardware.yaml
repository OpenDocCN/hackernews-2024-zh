- en: A Wharton professor who studies AI, innovation, and start-ups dramatically claims
    that "the modern economy rests on a single road in Spruce Pine, North Carolina."
    Ethan Mollick explains that this unremarkable road leads to a Sibelco North America
    Inc. facility where ultra-high-purity quartz is mined. This location is vitally
    important as it is claimed to be "the sole supplier of the quartz required to
    make the crucibles needed to refine silicon wafers."

- en: For further insight into why the Spruce Pine location is so unique, the official
    Sibelco pages do a pretty good job of encapsulating the story of this particular
    mine. It is the world’s leading high-purity quartz (HPQ) provider, and the firm
    claims it produces “the world’s highest quality quartz” at this mine.

  zh: 要深入了解为什么Spruce Pine的位置如此独特，官方Sibelco页面非常好地概括了这个矿山的故事。它是世界领先的高纯度石英（HPQ）供应商，该公司声称在这个矿山生产“世界上最高质量的石英”。
- en: Geologically speaking, the uniquely pure minerals at Spruce Mine were created
    about 380 million years ago when Africa collided with North America. This momentous
    collision, however slow, caused intense friction and heat miles below the Earth’s
    surface. According to Sibelco, the Spruce Mine minerals were created by a rich
    mineral-forming liquid that cooled and crystallized over time. A standout feature
    of these minerals is that they were made in their purest forms due to a lack of
    water, which caused all the friction.

  zh: 从地质角度来看，Spruce矿区的独特纯净矿物是大约3.8亿年前非洲与北美洲碰撞时形成的。这一重要的碰撞，虽然缓慢，却在地表下数英里处引起了剧烈的摩擦和热量。据Sibelco称，Spruce矿区的矿物是由富含矿物形成液体冷却结晶而成的。这些矿物的显著特点是它们由于缺水而以其最纯净的形式形成，这造成了所有的摩擦。
- en: In more recent history, it is claimed that the Spruce Pine site has been mined
    for centuries, with Native American peoples known to have mined Mica. In addition
    to Mica and the headlining HPQ, the mine is a rich source of kaolin and feldspar.

- en: Returning to the question of Spruce Pine's particular importance, Mollick makes
    it clear in his social media thread that, yes, fully synthetic techniques are
    available to create similarly pure quartz. However, any sudden closure or interruption
    of the mining at Spruce Pine would likely cause "pretty catastrophic" disruption
    (and extra expense) for a few years as the industry scales up manufacturing.

  zh: 回到Spruce Pine特别重要性的问题上，Mollick在他的社交媒体帖子中明确表示，是的，完全合成的技术可用于创建类似纯石英。然而，如果Spruce
    Pine的矿业突然关闭或中断，可能会导致几年内行业扩展生产时“相当灾难性”的中断（和额外开销）。
