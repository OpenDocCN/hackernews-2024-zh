- en: A Wharton professor who studies AI, innovation, and start-ups dramatically claims
    that "the modern economy rests on a single road in Spruce Pine, North Carolina."
    Ethan Mollick explains that this unremarkable road leads to a Sibelco North America
    Inc. facility where ultra-high-purity quartz is mined. This location is vitally
    important as it is claimed to be "the sole supplier of the quartz required to
    make the crucibles needed to refine silicon wafers."

    Park, Bengaluru, and the Shenzhen SEZ have become household names due to their
    tech hub status. Put into this perspective, the remarkable nature of Spruce Pine
    is all the more eyebrow-raising.

    probable "end of computer chip manufacture as we know it," should something untoward
    happen at Spruce Pine or in the skies above it.

- en: For further insight into why the Spruce Pine location is so unique, the official
    Sibelco pages do a pretty good job of encapsulating the story of this particular
    mine. It is the world’s leading high-purity quartz (HPQ) provider, and the firm
    claims it produces “the world’s highest quality quartz” at this mine.

    about 380 million years ago when Africa collided with North America. This momentous
    collision, however slow, caused intense friction and heat miles below the Earth’s
    surface. According to Sibelco, the Spruce Mine minerals were created by a rich
    mineral-forming liquid that cooled and crystallized over time. A standout feature
    of these minerals is that they were made in their purest forms due to a lack of
    water, which caused all the friction.

    for centuries, with Native American peoples known to have mined Mica. In addition
    to Mica and the headlining HPQ, the mine is a rich source of kaolin and feldspar.

    who used Mica as an insulator in some of his inventions as far back as 1879.

- en: Returning to the question of Spruce Pine's particular importance, Mollick makes
    it clear in his social media thread that, yes, fully synthetic techniques are
    available to create similarly pure quartz. However, any sudden closure or interruption
    of the mining at Spruce Pine would likely cause "pretty catastrophic" disruption
    (and extra expense) for a few years as the industry scales up manufacturing.
