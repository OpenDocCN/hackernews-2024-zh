    treated like a Neanderthal when you tell this to your friends? Are you worried
    that you’ll be labelled as a conspiracy theorist if you raise the alarm about
    all the data and power being transferred to the ‘cashless’ digital payments industry?

    a right to be concerned about cashless society, and you don’t have to come across
    like a crackpot when making the argument for cash. In fact, you can come across
    as very reasonable. I know this, because I spend a significant part of my life
    defending cash in very mainstream circles, and I often leave people who were totally
    OK about cashless society feeling a lot less sure. For example, I recently debated
    the issue at the Brussels Economic Forum. Before the debate, the audience (which
    consisted of hundreds of policy wonks, economists and EU officials) was polled,
    with 42% being keen on a totally cashless society. By the end, that number had
    fallen to 27%.

    say the same thing about digitization, regardless of their respective country’s
    situation. They will say that digital automation - and the speed, scale and interconnection
    it brings - is not only good, but unstoppable. This ideology is nested in another,
    deeper, ideology, which says that the global economy must always expand and accelerate.

    and embracing the technology, but if you have other priorities you’re told to
    *prepare* forthe transition, and *adapt.* This vision of a race towards a pre-set

    it stems - in the final analysis - from the corporate sector, which benefits the
    most from the data, scale, speed and globe-spanning capabilities that digital
    automation brings. The meta-narrative, and its sub-narratives, gets applied across
    the board to many different areas of life, but when it comes to payments it gets
    applied to *cash*.

    out by multiple issuers in multiple forms, but through the lens of the transnational
    digitization narrative this nuance gets reduced to a binary between ‘physical
    money vs. digital money’. We then get told that there will be an inevitable transition
    from the former to the latter. As we’d expect from the meta-narrative, getting
    rid of cash is cast as a kind of unstoppable global competition, with some leading
    and some lagging.

    being ‘left behind’. For example, [here is a UK labour party politician](https://labourlist.org/2021/10/access-to-cash-is-still-crucial-the-government-must-move-to-protect-it/)
    saying that while it is obvious that a cashless society is coming, “it is really
    important that we make sure we do this in a managed, careful way, making sure
    that nobody is left behind”, because some people ‘still’ use cash. The language
    reinforces the idea that cashless society is like an unstoppable weather event
    that’s approaching, and that some people will need temporary shelter from it.

    a Citigroup executive who was asked what the greatest risk of a cashless society
    was. His answer was ‘ensuring full inclusivity’. In short, he thought the greatest
    risk was that not everyone would be absorbed into his bank’s (and other banks’)
    systems. After all, a ‘cashless’ society is a society where you have to use cards
    and apps provided by the banking sector. To remedy this risk, he suggested that
    banks and governments must work together to onboard people into the system. It’s
    a bit like a McDonald’s executive saying that the greatest risk of McDonald’s
    is that not everyone has a McDonald’s close by, and that the state should help
    McDonald’s extend its services.

    is a formalization process by which large institutions get between our economic
    interactions, which means it’s accompanied by a change in the *feel* or *vibe*
    of our society. As Visa and MasterCard insert themselves between every act of
    exchange, everything starts to feel more gentrified. Zones of informality that
    we actually treasure - such as giving your kid pocket money, or playing a simple
    game of poker at home with your friends, doing a garage sale, or competing in
    a pub quiz with a small monetary prize - now all have to be incorporated into
    a formal economy that’s presided over by large institutions. Cash, by contrast,
    protects us from total formalization.

- en: Step 4 is designed to show us that cash has a crucial role in keeping the dark
    side of digital money in check, and that in the absence of cash that dark side
    would really get to express itself. This goes a long way towards rebalancing the
    debate, but it’s wishful thinking to imagine that anti-cash proponents will give
    up. In my experience, they try to neutralise the Balance of Power arguments by
    cherry-picking single negative elements of cash, and then presenting those as
    if they were a killer argument to get rid of the balance of power entirely. In
    Part 2 we’re going to train ourselves to fight off these single-issue insults
    and accusations thrown at cash. I’m also going to show you how to derail the typical
    account of *why* cash is in decline, through a simple visual model. Finally, we
    will look at the steps required to bring about a revival in cash. I hope you enjoyed
    the piece, and please do use the comments section to make suggestions for additional
    arguments that can be added.
