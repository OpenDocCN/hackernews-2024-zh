    overnight, and the field has exploded over the past year, with a record $29.1
    billion invested across nearly 700 deals in 2023, according to PitchBook. OpenAI's
    ChatGPT first showcased the tech's ability to produce human-like language and
    creative content in late 2022\. Since then, OpenAI has said [more than 92%](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/11/06/openai-announces-more-powerful-gpt-4-turbo-and-cuts-prices.html)
