- en: Langley Air Force Base, located in one of the most strategic areas of the country,
    across the Chesapeake Bay from the sprawling Naval Station Norfolk and the open
    Atlantic, was at the epicenter of waves of mysterious drone incursions that occurred
    throughout December. *The War Zone* has been investigating these incidents and
    the response to them for months. We know that they were so troubling and persistent
    that they prompted bringing in advanced assets from around the U.S. government,
    including one of NASA's [WB-57F high-flying research planes](https://www.twz.com/this-is-why-one-of-nasas-wb-57f-canberra-jets-is-in-south-korea).
    Now the U.S. Air Force has confirmed to us that they did indeed occur and provided
    details on the timeframe and diversity of drones involved.

    evening of December 6 [2023] and experienced multiple incursions throughout the
    month of December. The number of UASs fluctuated and they ranged in size/configuration,"
    a spokesperson for Langley Air Force Base told *The War Zone* in a statement earlier
    today. "None of the incursions appeared to exhibit hostile intent but anything
    flying in our restricted airspace can pose a threat to flight safety. The FAA
    was made aware of the UAS incursions."'

    Newport News and Hampton Roads in southeastern Virginia. Langley, one of a [select

    missions to defend the U.S. homeland, including protecting the nation's capital

    the East Coast and home to roughly half of America's carrier fleet, is located
    just to the southeast. A host of other military installations are also dotted
    throughout the broader area, including Naval Air Station Oceana, the Navy's master
    tactical jet base on the East Coast, and Dam Neck, Navy Special Warfare's East
    Coast headquarters.

    the same time is unclear, although the mysterious drone incursions extended beyond
    Langley. The situation prompted a serious response and caused significant reverberations
    throughout the U.S. military. Also remember that it is the Air Force's job to
    protect American airspace, not the Navy's. Having a base tasked with that mission,
    and its airspace getting penetrated for weeks on end is clearly not the best look,
    especially after major lapses in domain awareness and air defense capabilities
    were recently spotlighted by the Chinese Spy Balloon saga. These are the same
    issues *The War Zone* had [been warning of for years prior](https://www.twz.com/chinas-spy-balloon-over-montana-is-part-of-a-larger-more-troubling-pattern).

    there are real national security and general aviation safety concerns. Groups
    of drones, even small commercially available types without any kind of armed capability,
    could impede flight operations and conduct highly valuable surveillance. Just
    their presence effectively probes defenses and can provide critical information.
    Weaponizing these drones could cause immersive damage. While F-22s are the hardest
    fighters to confront in the sky, comparatively simple drones could destroy dozens
    of them as they sit idle on the ground, and do so over great distances.
