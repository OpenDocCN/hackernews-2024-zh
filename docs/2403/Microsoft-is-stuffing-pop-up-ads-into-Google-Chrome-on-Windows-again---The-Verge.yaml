- en: Microsoft is once again injecting pop-ups into Google’s Chrome browser in a
    bid to get people to switch to Bing. The software giant first [introduced malware-like
    pop-up ads](/2023/8/30/23851902/microsoft-bing-popups-windows-11-malware) last
    year with a prompt that appeared over the top of other apps and windows. After
    pausing that notification to address “unintended behavior,” the pop-ups have returned
    again on Windows 10 and 11.

- en: Windows users have reported seeing the new pop-up in recent days, advertising
    Bing AI and Microsoft’s Bing search engine inside Google Chrome. If you click
    yes to this prompt, then Microsoft will set Bing as the default search engine
    for Chrome. These latest prompts look like malware, and once again have [Windows
    users asking](https://www.reddit.com/r/antivirus/comments/1beg1bi/is_this_microsoft_bing_popup_malware/)
    if they are legit or nefarious. Microsoft has confirmed to *The Verge* that the
    pop-ups are genuine and should only appear once.

    default search engine on Chrome,” says Caitlin Roulston, director of communications,
    in a statement to *The Verge*. Roulston framed the pop-up as offering perks to
    Windows users, since they can get more chat turns in Copilot if they accept the
    notification. “We value providing our customers with choice, so there is an option
    to dismiss the notification.”

    offer up an easy way to disable these pop-ups for good. There are a variety of
    ways that Microsoft attempts to prompt Windows users into switching to Bing and
    Edge, making it difficult to avoid them through tweaking settings.

- en: I’ve been growing increasingly frustrated with Microsoft’s attempts to aggressively
    push pop-up ads on Chrome users in recent years. Microsoft has been using pop-ups
    inside Chrome, on the Windows taskbar, and elsewhere to promote its own services.
    Microsoft even once [forced people into Edge after a Windows Update](/21310611/microsoft-edge-browser-forced-update-chromium-editorial),
    and it regularly presents a full-screen message to try to get Windows users to
    switch to Bing and Edge after updates are applied.

    where its Edge browser was automatically importing browsing data and tabs from
    Chrome without consent. [I personally experienced the bug](/24054329/microsoft-edge-automatic-chrome-import-data-feature);
    after I rebooted my PC for a Windows update, Microsoft Edge automatically opened
    with the Chrome tabs I was working on before the update.

    that I was “counting the days until the next annoying pop-up appears,” and here
    it is a little over six months later. I’m still hoping Microsoft will eventually
    give up with these annoying pop-ups and respect Windows users’ choice to pick
    whichever search engine and browser they wish to use.'
