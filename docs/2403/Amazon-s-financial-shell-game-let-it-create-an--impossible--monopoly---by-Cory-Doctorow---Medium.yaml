    to competing. And if Amazon tried to keep the loss-leader going indefinitely by
    “cross-subsidizing” the losses with high-margin profits from some other part of
    its business, rivals could sell those high margin goods at a lower margin, which

    can’t live without Amazon. The majority of US households have Prime, and 90% of
    Prime households start their ecommerce searches on Amazon; if they find what they’re
    looking for, they buy it and stop. Thus, merchants who don’t sell on Amazon just
    don’t sell. This is called “monopsony power” and it’s a lot easier to maintain
    than monopoly power. For most manufacturers, a 10% overnight drop in sales is
    a catastrophe, so a retailer that commands even a 10% market-share can extract
    huge concessions from its suppliers. Amazon’s share of most categories of goods
    is a lot higher than 10%!'

    suppliers who sell goods more cheaply in rival stores, or even on their own site.
    The punishments vary, from banishing your products to page ten million of search-results
    to simply kicking you off the platform. With publishers, Amazon reserves the right
    to lower the prices they set when listing their books, to match the lowest price
    on the web, and paying publishers less for each sale.'

    in business) have to dramatically hike their prices on Amazon, and when they do,
    they also have to hike their prices everywhere else (no wonder Prime customers

    Amazon is a public company. In exchange for access to the capital markets, it
    owes the public certain disclosures, which are set out in the SEC’s rulebook.
    The SEC lets Amazon — and other gigantic companies — get away with a degree of
    secrecy that should disqualify it from offering stock to the public. As Mitchell
    says, SEC chairman Gary Gensler should adopt “new rules that more concretely define
    what qualifies as a segment and remove the discretion given to executives.”
