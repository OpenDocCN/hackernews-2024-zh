I support [@EFF](/EFF) (Electronic Frontier Organization) because digital rights are human rights. [eff.org/join](https://t.co/FFbIeub00B). Also, it has a sweet add-on for Firefox and Android: Privacy Badger automatically learns to block invisible trackers.

“EFF has for years warned of the dangers of face recognition technology, including threats to people’s First Amendment-protected right to protest." - [@EFF](/EFF) [fastcompany.com/91116791/facia…](https://t.co/hVtW8URozS)

We are delighted to announce that OSUSEC's Cyber Defense won first place in PRCCDC 2024 last week!! This is our third year in a row, and we're super excited to continue to represent OSU cybersecurity for another year!

Last year, NYS made a step in the right direction with a regulatory ban on the use of facial recognition in schools, but has yet to codify this under law. Contact your state reps to demand they pass S7944/A8853 to ensure we fully [#BanTheScan](/hashtag/%23BanTheScan) in NY schools. [banthescan.org](https://t.co/jGxD3ASMbY)

Needless to say, this is [#kosa](/hashtag/%23kosa) level of bad. [@fightfortheftr](/fightfortheftr) [@EFF](/EFF) and many others opposes KOSA and they,without a doubt, oppose [#AB3080](/hashtag/%23AB3080) as well as it is unconstitutional and a huge privacy risk.

What is cybersecurity in the age of artificial intelligence (AI)? This event brings together experts in computer science, law, adversarial machine learning, and tech advocacy from [@UW](/UW) and [@EFF](/EFF). [supporters.eff.org/civicrm/event/…](https://t.co/RwnZivPlmJ)

"I, and many of my friends, grew up in an Internet where remaining anonymous was common sense, and where revealing your identity was foolish and dangerous... [KOSA] spits in the face of these very practical instincts, forces you to dox yourself." [eff.org/deeplinks/2024…](https://t.co/gJ8zqOy6yY) [@EFF](/EFF)

A company called Clearview AI has scraped the internet to gather (without consent) 30 billion images to support a tool that lets users identify people by picture alone. Learn more in this podcast from [@EFF](/EFF): [bit.ly/3U4CLXX](https://t.co/cq43gSb759)

Thanks to [@EFF](/EFF) for the boost. I am actually hearing from reporters around here which means they're seeing people from outside of Mass take notice. It's a Greater Boston media tradition but hey, we'll take it. The more pressure the more likely legislators will be to move on this.

“This is the clearest picture that we’ve gotten of how cell-site simulators are operated, installed, and sold to police in years,” EFF’s [@cooperq](/cooperq) told [@HorizonMass](/HorizonMass). “There absolutely needs to be case law requiring a warrant for a simulator.” [horizonmass.news/2024/04/03/fea…](https://t.co/n8qYMnnxpr)
