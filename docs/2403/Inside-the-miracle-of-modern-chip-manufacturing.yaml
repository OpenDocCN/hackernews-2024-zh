    machines that can transfer microscopic patterns on to each wafer using a process
    called photolithography.'

- en: For the smallest chips, multi-million-dollar machines made by a single Dutch
    company, ASML, use extreme ultraviolet light to create these fine stencils. The
    machines are the size of a bus, but so accurate they could direct a laser to hit
    a golf ball as far away as the Moon.

- en: While leading manufacturers are hoping the 2nm chip will solve many of the 3nm
    generation’s problems, the limits of scaling mean engineers are already developing
    alternative ways of getting more power and efficiency out of the same space.

- en: Building on current 3D designs, engineers plan to stack transistors on top of
    each other, rather than cramming them in side-by-side.

- en: “You’re really starting to expand that third dimension, which is something that
    hasn’t been used in the first 60 years of transistor technology,” says Intel’s
    Auth. “[When] you build skyscrapers, you start to run out of the ability to shrink
    things laterally, so you start to build up and that’s what we’re doing.”

- en: The way chips are packaged is also going upwards. The growing field of “advanced
    packaging” — how chips are bundled together to boost capability as well as reduce
    cost — is moving towards stacking chips to improve performance and better use
    available space.

- en: This pivot to vertical design and development is “kind of a big deal”, says
    Koch of SemiAnalysis, because it is the first time the industry has acknowledged
    that it’s running out of horizontal options. “We’re slowing down in one direction,
    but speeding up in another,” he says.

    which TSMC is heavily invested. “There are a lot of different configurations that
    can be used . . . a lot of things are happening in this field.”

- en: Engineers are moving away from building an entire microprocessor on a single
    piece of silicon — the monolithic “system on a chip” — and towards multi-chip
    modules (MCMs). These MCMs see groups of chips with different functions built
    on separate pieces of silicon and then bundled together to work like a single
    electronic brain.
