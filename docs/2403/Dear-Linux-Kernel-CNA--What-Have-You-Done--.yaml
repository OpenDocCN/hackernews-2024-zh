- en: In February 2024, the Linux Kernel project started its own CVE Numbering Authority
    (CNA), which means that they will now directly handle the assignment of CVEs for
    vulnerabilities in the Linux Kernel.

    CVE’s. To quote their CVE process[1]:'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '*"[&mldr;] due to the layer at which the Linux kernel is in a system, almost
    any bug might be exploitable to compromise the security of the kernel, but the
    possibility of exploitation is often not evident when the bug is fixed. Because
    of this, **the CVE assignment team is overly cautious and assign CVE numbers to
    any bugfix that they identify.** This explains the seemingly large number of CVEs
    that are issued by the Linux kernel team."*'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Going forward, a large number of CVEs will be assigned for fixes that have no
    real security impact. A quick count of the linux-cve-announce mailing list shows
    that over 200 CVEs were assigned in the first 4 days of operation, the majority
    of which have no demonstrated security impact.

    challenges, especially in the case of product manufacturing and electronic devices:'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Electronic devices are part of critical processes, and frequent updates introduce
    failure risk and are difficult to plan. They might be subject to testing, type
    certification, and possibly require a maintenance window to install them. It is
    something you only do when necessary. ‘Just’ running the latest version and performing
    **frequent rolling updates is seldom a workable strategy for electronic devices
    deployed in the field**.
  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Engineering time is always in short supply and most teams lack the capacity
    to triage the volume of CVEs that are being generated. This restricts their ability
    to identify which CVEs are relevant for their product, but also to identify those
    that present a real vulnerability. **Assigning CVEs for issues other than security
    vulnerabilities places the burden on each product organisation using Linux.**
  prefs:

    which make **security updates for each known vulnerability mandatory**.

    and regulation around the world. Examples of these are the Radio Equipment Directive
    and the Cyber Resilience Act.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To achieve this, the use of Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) is often legislated
    to support finding any known vulnerabilities for a particular component that is
    being used in a product.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Known vulnerabilities are in practice defined as ‘something with a CVE’. If
    any known vulnerabilities are present, the vendor is expected to fix these and
    provide a security update without undue delay to the asset owner.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The SBOM approach is not very granular as it relies on version numbering, and
    it cannot provide insights on whether a vulnerable code path of a CVE is ever
    reached, and thus relevant for the product in question.

    have known vulnerabilities *all the time*, imaginary or not.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The additional argument that many devices are not connected to the internet
    and thus present reduced attack surface is insufficient going forward. As evidence
    of this, the updated EU Machinery Regulation makes a point that every product
    must have an adequate standard of cybersecurity, regardless of its operating context.
    Claiming that a product is part of an isolated network is thus no longer a valid
    reason to fail to integrate security controls in the product or to issue security
    patches.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now that regulations prevent us from merely ignoring wrongly assigned CVEs,
    it’s evident that to triage and stay on top of security updates, we need engineers
    to take a closer look at the relevancy of vulnerabilities. Not every company has
    the capability to do this.

- en: The CVE system might be far from perfect, a point clearly made in the Kernel
    CNA team’s introduction to their CVE process, stating that *“Over time, their
    [CVE] usefulness has declined with regards to the Kernel project, and CVE numbers
    were very often assigned in inappropriate ways and for inappropriate reasons.
    Because of this, the Kernel development community has tended to avoid them.”*
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It is clear that the current process is based on the learnings, and frustrations,
    the team has faced in the past. The new process seems made for convenience, to
    limit the time Kernel engineers must spend on unproductive workflows.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: While such a position can certainly be understood, it is difficult to comprehend
    how the usefulness of the system will be improved by assigning a CVE to each bugfix
    in the Linux Kernel. Additionally, assigning CVEs to all bugfixes out of *“an
    abundance of caution”* may be inappropriate. Typically, security researchers are
    held to higher standards when disclosing vulnerabilities. The expectation is that
    CVEs are assigned for *‘meaningful’* security vulnerabilities, and not for any
    software fixes that *‘might’* be a security vulnerability.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: By taking this position, this effort is now duplicated across thousands of engineering
    teams *ad infinitum*, instead of handling it at the source, in a central, efficient
    and reliable manner.

    will eventually be open to reconsider their approach to issuing CVEs, or at least
    engage in a discussion to make the CVE process more productive for everyone. Whether
    that can really happen still is to be seen.

    approach of the parties involved. It does not happen in silos but requires an
    end-to-end perspective. If we can no longer rely on CVE information being meaningful,
    the entire ecosystem, with all its known issues, will be much less effective than
    it could be.
