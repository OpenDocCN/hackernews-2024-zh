    is coming out on April 2\. If you like my Substack, you will like it, or at least
    that is what early readers are telling me. And, given that my publisher has told
    me that pre-orders are really important to a book’s success, if you want to get
    it, now would be a great time: [here is the link to pre-order in any format you
    might like.](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/741805/co-intelligence-by-ethan-mollick/?ref=PRH410E2C567AF)'

- en: As you will see later in this post, AI played a critical role in writing the
    book (though likely not in the ways you might think), but I also wanted it to
    play an important role in reading the book, too. To make that happen, I have been
    building a set of AI tools, including a number of GPTs, to help people interrogate,
    apply, and interact with the book in new ways. The cool thing about GPTs is that
    they are a [useful early form of AI agent that can be quite powerful](https://www.oneusefulthing.org/p/almost-an-agent-what-gpts-can-do),
    the downside is that they are also a bit of a [security nightmare](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11538)
    - it is possible to extract the files I use for the GPT (which include a lot of
    text from the book) by tricking the AI. So, for now, I am planning on making these
    tools as exclusive as possible to people who pre-order the book. [If you buy it
    before March 31, you can unlock the content on that day here](https://www.moreusefulthings.com/book).

    a bit about the role AI played in writing it, because it touches on more general
    issues of what it means to have AI overlap with a job.

    writer, or someone managing my social media feeds. The answer to all those questions
    is no, it is just me, writing and tweeting more than I probably should (which
    is why I hope people are forgiving of my spelling errors and erratic newsletter
    schedules). Then, naturally, people also ask me if I use AI to write for me, and
    the answer, again, is no, for a reason that I think is useful to understand.

    AI system. All the evidence we have is that the most advanced LLMs [write better
    than most people](https://economics.mit.edu/sites/default/files/inline-files/Noy_Zhang_1_0.pdf),
    but [worse than good writers](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.14556.pdf). From an assignment
    where I had my students “cheat” by writing essays by prompting the AI, I learned
    that [good prompting can improve the quality of AI writing more than many people
    think](https://www.oneusefulthing.org/p/embracing-weirdness-what-it-means), but
    it still can’t get you to the top 1%, or even top 20%, of human performance.

    at, you are very likely better than the best LLM at that same skill. This is why,
    at least for now, AI use can feel liberating - it does the tasks you want to do
    least so you can concentrate on the ones you both like best and are best at. Thus,
    I used AI extensively in the book, just not specifically for writing.

    to become a Centaur or Cyborg. Fortunately, this does not involve getting cursed
    to turn into the half human/half horse of Greek myth or grafting electronic gizmos
    to your body. They are rather two approaches to co-intelligence that integrate
    the work of person and machine. Centaur work has a clear line between person and
    machine, like the clear line between the human torso and horse body of the mythical
    centaur. It depends on a strategic division of labor, switching between AI and
    human tasks, allocating responsibilities based on the strengths and capabilities
    of each entity. When I am doing an analysis with the help of AI, I will decide
    on what statistical approaches to do but then let the AI handle producing graphs.
    [In our study at BCG, Centaurs would do the work they were strongest at themselves,
    and then hand off tasks inside the Jagged Frontier to the AI.](https://www.oneusefulthing.org/p/centaurs-and-cyborgs-on-the-jagged)
  prefs: []

- en: On the other hand, Cyborgs blend machine and person, integrating the two deeply.
    Cyborgs don’t just delegate tasks; they intertwine their efforts with AI, moving
    back and forth over the Jagged Frontier. Bits of tasks get handed to the AI, such
    as initiating a sentence for the AI to complete, so that Cyborgs find themselves
    working in tandem with the AI. My book could not have been written, at least in
    the form you can [order it](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/741805/co-intelligence-by-ethan-mollick/?ref=PRH410E2C567AF)
    in today (subtle hint), without both Cyborg and Centaur Tasks.

    books, that could mean a single sentence or paragraph would block hours of writing,
    as I used my frustration as an excuse to take a break and walk away until inspiration
    struck. With AI, that was no longer a problem. I would become a Cyborg and tell
    the AI: I am stuck on a paragraph in a section of a book about how AI can help
    get you unstuck. **Can you help me rewrite the paragraph and finish it by giving
    me 10 options for the entire paragraph in four professional styles? Make the styles
    and approaches different from each other, making them extremely well written.**
    In an instant, I had the paragraph written in a persuasive style, an informative
    style, a narrative style, and more. While I rarely used any of the text the AI
    produced, it gave me options and pathways forward. Similarly, when I felt a paragraph
    was clunky and bad, I would ask the AI: **Make this better, in the style of a
    bestselling popular book about AI,** or **add more vivid examples.** The text
    it produced almost never appears in the book, but they helped guide me out of
    difficulty. And, interestingly, it was some of these paragraphs that my editor
    seemed to like best.'

    knew the AI exceeded my capabilities in summarizing, while I exceeded it in understanding.
    While I have worked with the AI group at the MIT Media Lab, I am not myself a
    computer scientist. When reading some of the technical literature, I would ask
    the AI to summarize a paper to see if I understood it in the right way, knowing
    full well that the AI could get me only partway there. There are over 200 references
    in the book, so I would also use these AI summaries and notes to refer back to.
    When sudden inspiration would hit, and I was not near a computer, I would open
    up an AI app and use its voice recognition to dictate notes, having the AI organize
    them and email them to me to incorporate later.

    and editors to help me, I didn’t want to bother them while working on early drafts.
    But I still wanted feedback. I created AI readers to help. I used these AI-created
    figures at various points in the book to help me improve my writing.

    to add too much complexity and nuance to everything. AI is great at summarizing
    and simplifying, so I wanted to get some advice on where I could do the same.
    I decided the advice would feel a bit easier to take if the AI also had an over-the-top
    personality, so I created Ozymandias by prompting: **You are Ozymandias. You are
    going to help Ethan Mollick write a book chapter on using AI at work. Your job
    is to offer critical feedback to help improve the book. You speak in a pompous,
    self-important voice but are very helpful and focused on simplifying things. Here

    joke section, is commendable. However, there is a risk that it may come across
    as forced. Remember, dear Ethan, humour is a spice to be sprinkled sparingly,
    not poured*. Pretty direct feedback (and the addition of British English is a
    nice touch). But AI editors, unlike human ones, can be safely ignored on some
    topics, so I kept the jokes (you can let me know if that is a good idea or a bad
    one).'

    providing an outside perspective I may not have had otherwise. So, while I did
    not use an AI to write my book, this book was the one I enjoyed writing most because
    of AI. The AI let me get support for some of the worst aspects of book writing,
    and hopefully let me focus on what makes my writing appealing, though you can
    be the judge of that yourself ([hint, hint](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/741805/co-intelligence-by-ethan-mollick/?ref=PRH410E2C567AF))

    has showcased its impressive writing capabilities. Although it may not match the
    level of the most talented human writers, it represents a significant leap forward
    from its predecessor, Claude 2, which already demonstrated superior writing abilities
    compared to other AI models. (I had Claude 3 write those last couple sentences,
    but I tend to agree). Similarly, new models like Gemini 1.5 can fit my entire
    book inside their context window which enables new ways of working with text,
    including the ability to write a blurb based on the full contents of the book.
    With the rapid increase in capabilities, the real question is how good AI can
    get, and how rapidly it will improve.

    of how quickly LLM development is happening right now. And the answer is that
    LLMs are improving several times as fast as [Moore's Law, the engine of the digital
    age](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1677462), which holds that the number
    of transistors on a computer chip doubles every two years or so. For LLMs, the
    main measure in the paper is how well models perform, and the authors find that
    the compute needed to achieve a given level of AI ability is halving every 5 to
    14 months, as opposed to 24 months for Moore’s Law.

    exponential improvement over time.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The paper also shows that the speed of improvement is not slowing down over
    time, at least not yet. Cut that doesn’t mean that the growth of AI abilities
    will continue indefinitely, or that LLMs will continue to improve in writing as
    quickly as other tasks. We could see a plateau of AI capability, slower growth,
    or continued exponential gain. We just don’t know what will happen next. I only
    know that, based on just the changes waiting for us in the coming year, any future
    book is likely to be written very differently than the one that you can [pre-order](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/741805/co-intelligence-by-ethan-mollick/?ref=PRH410E2C567AF)
