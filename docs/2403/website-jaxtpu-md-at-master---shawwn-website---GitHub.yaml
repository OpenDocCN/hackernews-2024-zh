    my opinion, that "fun" is the key ingredient. It's how you discover what kind
    of research you're interested in. Or at least, it was the only way I could; when
    you have no idea whether StyleGAN will run on a TPU, what else can you do but
    play around with it for a bit? No need to go into it with lofty expectations;
    just screw around with whatever seems interesting.

    the same way you would on any other server, because TPUs are literally just massive
    Ubuntu servers.

- en: 'Random sidenote: if you need an RPC lib, use [Ray](https://ray.io/). It''s
    such a breath of fresh air. RPC used to suck, but it''s a killer combo with TPU
    VMs + Jax. For example, you can [train a GPT model across 8 separate v2-8''s](https://twitter.com/theshawwn/status/1406171487988498433)
    by putting each layer on a different TPU. If it sounds crazy, well... it''s time
    to readjust our expectations. Crazy ideas no longer feel impossible to implement.'

    was to find out, "Can Jax use the 335GB host RAM, in addition to the 16GB MXU
    memory?"

    It's simple. And by the way, you can SSH into your TPUs. You can host a redis
    server, for example, using that 335GB RAM. By the way, throw in a few dozen other
    servers; the TPU has 96 CPU cores. Wanna see 96 CPU cores go brr? Build Tensorflow
    from source, and run `htop`, and It'll light up like a Christmas tree. It'll finish
    building in like, 20-30min too."

    Cloud TPU team! Ya'll rock. TPU VMs are everything I've ever dreamed, and more.
