- en: Google is taking action against algorithmically generated spam. The search engine
    giant just announced [upcoming changes](https://developers.google.com/search/blog/2024/03/core-update-spam-policies),
    including a revamped spam policy, designed in part to keep AI clickbait out of
    its search results.

    Google,” says Lily Ray, senior director of SEO at the marketing agency Amsive.
    “It could change everything.”

    the change will reduce “low-quality, unoriginal content” in search results by
    40 percent. It will focus on reducing what the company calls “scaled content abuse,”
    which is when bad actors flood the internet with massive amounts of articles and
    blog posts designed to game search engines.

    around obituary spam,” says Google’s vice president of search, Pandu Nayak. [Obituary
    spam](https://www.wired.com/story/morbid-war-online-obituaries/) is an especially
    grim type of digital piracy, where people attempt to make money by scraping and
    republishing death notices, sometimes on social platforms like [YouTube](https://www.wired.com/story/youtube-obituary-pirates/).
    Recently, obituary spammers have started [using artificial intelligence](https://www.theverge.com/24065145/ai-obituary-spam-generative-clickbait)
    tools to increase their output, making the issue even worse. Google’s new policy,
    if enacted effectively, should make it harder for this type of spam to crop up
    in online searches.

- en: This notably more aggressive approach to combating search spam takes specific
    aim at “domain squatting,” a practice in which scavengers purchase websites with
    name recognition to profit off their reputations, often replacing original journalism
    with AI-generated articles designed to manipulate search engine rankings. This
    type of behavior predates the AI boom, but with the rise of text-generation tools
    like ChatGPT, it’s [become increasingly easy](https://www.wired.com/story/ai-generated-marketing-content/)
    to churn out endless articles to game Google rankings.

    Google Search’s reputation in recent years. “People can spin up these sites really
    easily,” says SEO expert Gareth Boyd, who runs the digital marketing firm Forte
    Analytica. “It’s been a big issue.” (Boyd admits that he has even created similar
    sites in the past, though he says he doesn’t do it anymore.)

- en: In February, WIRED reported on several [AI clickbait networks](https://www.wired.com/story/confessions-of-an-ai-clickbait-kingpin/)
    that used domain squatting as a strategy, including one that took the websites
    for the defunct indie women’s website [The Hairpin](https://www.wired.com/story/plaintext-hairpin-blog-ai-clickbait-farm/)
    and the shuttered Hong Kong-based pro-democracy tabloid [Apple Daily](https://www.wired.com/story/confessions-of-an-ai-clickbait-kingpin/)
    and filled them with AI-generated nonsense. Another [transformed the website of
    a small-town Iowa newspaper](https://www.wired.com/story/iowa-newspaper-website-ai-generated-clickbait-factory/)
    into a bizarro repository for AI blog posts on retail stocks. According to Google’s
    new policy, this type of behavior is now explicitly categorized by the company
    as spam.

- en: In addition to domain squatting, Google’s new policy will also focus on eliminating
    “reputation abuse,” where otherwise trustworthy websites allow third-party sources
    to publish janky sponsored content or other digital junk. (Google’s blog post
    describes “payday loan reviews on a trusted educational website” as an example.)
    While the other parts of the spam policy will start enforcement immediately, Google
    is giving 60 days notice prior to cracking down on reputational abuse, to give
    websites time to fall in line.

    of last year. More broadly, the company has been working on ways to fix low-quality
    content in search, including AI-generated spam, since 2022\. “We’ve been aware
    of the problem,” Nayak says. “It takes time to develop these changes effectively.”

    Google’s search efficacy. “It’s going to reinstate the way things used to be,
    hopefully,” says Ray. “But we have to see what happens.”
