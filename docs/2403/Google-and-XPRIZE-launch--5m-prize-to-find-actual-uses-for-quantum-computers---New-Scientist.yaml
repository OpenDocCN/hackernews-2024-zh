- en: Google and XPRIZE are launching a $5 million competition to find practical uses
    for quantum computers that could actually benefit society. We already know that
    quantum computers can perform specific tasks faster than classical computers,
    after Google first claimed [quantum advantage](/article/2217347-google-claims-it-has-finally-reached-quantum-supremacy/)
    for its Sycamore processor in 2019\. However, these demonstration tasks are simple
    benchmarks with no [real-world applications](/article/2390568-why-havent-we-got-useful-quantum-computers-yet/).

    computers give very, very large speed-ups,” says [Ryan Babbush](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=6I7jyygAAAAJ&hl=en)
    at Google. “But a lot of the research community has been less focused on trying
    to match those more abstract quantum speed-ups to specific real-world applications,
    and to try to figure out how quantum computers could be used.”

- en: To that end, Google and the XPRIZE Foundation are urging researchers to come
    up with new quantum algorithms as part of a three-year competition. The winning
    algorithms could solve an existing problem, like finding a new battery electrolyte
    that vastly improves storage capacity, but it doesn’t need to solve the problem
    in practice, says Babbush. Instead, researchers just need to show how an algorithm
    could be applied, detailing the exact quantum computing specifications required.
    Alternatively, competitors could show how an existing quantum algorithm could
    be applied to a real-world problem not previously considered.

    large their impact could be, whether they tackle problems similar to those outlined
    in the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, and how feasibly they can
    be run on machines that are available now or in the near-future.

    shared between up to three winners, $1 million shared between at most five runners-up
    and $50,000 for each of 20 semi-finalists.

    at technical definitions of quantum advantage, like those demonstrated by Google
    or IBM, to real-world uses, says [Nicolás Quesada](https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=dZNVjOEAAAAJ&hl=en)
    at Montreal Polytechnic in Canada. “[The prize is] hitting the nail on the head
    that this is a very important problem,” says Quesada. “We need to figure out what
    to do with a quantum computer.”

    understanding of how quantum computers work, such as how to deal with noise and
    errors, says [Bill Fefferman](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=EBIByAIAAAAJ&hl=en)
    at the University of Chicago. The prize doesn’t address this foundational aspect
    of building quantum computers, he says.

    useful,” Fefferman. “I’m not as optimistic that, in the next three years, we’ll
    be able to discover those algorithms and then also implement them on the current
    hardware that will exist.”
