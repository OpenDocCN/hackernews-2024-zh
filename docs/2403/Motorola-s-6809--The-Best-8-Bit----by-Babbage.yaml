    In the [first part](https://thechipletter.substack.com/p/motorolas-pioneering-8-bit-6800-origins),

    itself. In the [second](https://thechipletter.substack.com/p/leaving-arizona),
    Motorola’s management tried to force that team to move to Austin, Texas. The majority
    of the team left Motorola and some, including Chuck Peddle and Bill Mensch, joined
    MOS Technology in Pennsylvania, where they created the 6502.

    the BBC Micro, and many other popular designs.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    for over 38 percent of all 6800 instructions. Next were the subroutine calls and
    returns with 13 percent, conditional branches with 11 percent and unconditional
    jumps and branches with 6.5 percent … Neither the arithmetic nor' logical instructions
    had as high a usage as might have been expected. Clearly then, enhancements that
    would improve the utility and power of the data movements (such as load and stores)
    would yield the largest return on investment, followed by improvements to subroutine
    linkage and parameter passing.

    of the number of operations in 6800 machine code, not a ‘dynamic’ analysis of
    which instructions were being executed most often, for example, because they were
    being repeated within loops. It’s arguable that some of these results - the large

    the 6502 relied on the use of ‘zero page’ to access frequently used values. Access
    to these values was faster as only a single address byte was needed to specify
    the address. The 6809 enhanced the use of the zero page by adding a new 8-bit
    ‘Direct Page’ register which allowed the ‘zero page’ to be moved to anywhere in
    the 16-bit address space.

    program counter jumping to an address close by with the address determined by
    a single byte ‘offset’. To jump to an address outside this range, it was necessary
    to specify a two-byte ‘absolute address’ for the target code. This meant that
    code typically could not be ‘position independent’, it had to be written to be
    stored at a predetermined set of locations in memory.
  prefs: []

    full 64K memory range, by specifying a two-byte value that would be added to the

    own 68000, also launched in 1979\. The ambition of the 16/32-bit 68000 meant that
    it had nothing in common with the 6800 or 6809 and so there was no sensible upgrade
    path from the 6809 to the 68000\. The 6809’s architecture was an improvement over
    its predecessors but it was still an architectural dead end. The future lay with
    the 8086, 68000, and their successors.
