- en: The completion of the openVertebrate (oVert) project is a significant milestone
    for natural history museums, as well as researchers, educators, students, and
    the public. The digital library is the first to offer free access to incredibly
    detailed – and, frankly, beautiful – 3D images of over 13,000 vertebrates.

- en: More than a research project, oVert was a collaboration between like-minded
    specialists across 25 institutions whose sole objective was to add value to museum
    collections by making them more widely available. Importantly, these images provide
    an insight that would only otherwise be obtained by destructive dissection and
    tissue sampling.

    project’s lead principal investigator and curator of herpetology at the [Florida
    Museum](https://www.floridamuseum.ufl.edu/). “You want to protect specimens, but
    you also want to have people use them. oVert is a way of reducing the wear and
    tear on samples while also increasing access, and it’s the logical next step in
    the mission of museum collections.”

    the classes, or genera, of all amphibians, reptiles, fishes, birds, and mammals,
    rendering models that provide an intimate look at the creatures, inside and out.

    [Idaho Museum of Natural History](https://www.isu.edu/imnh/) was used to generate
    the whale’s digital model. Obviously too big to fit in a CT scanner, researchers
    painstakingly took the animal’s skeleton apart piece by piece, created models
    of each bone, and then reassembled it [physically and digitally](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/316516467_Laser_and_Structured_Light_Scanning_to_Acquire_3-D_Morphology).

    world. For example, armadillos were thought to be the only living mammals with
    tails covered with an internal coat of bony plates called osteoderms. Nope. In
    2023, Edward Stanley, co-principal investigator of the project, was performing
    routine scanning of [spiny mice](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10291248/)
    and found that they do, too.

    study osteoderms, and through kismet or fate, I happened to be the one scanning
    those particular specimens on that particular day and noticed something strange
    about their tails on the X-ray. That happens all the time. We’ve found all sorts
    of strange, unexpected things.”

    of more than 500 oVert specimens, that frogs have [lost and regained teeth](https://www.floridamuseum.ufl.edu/science/frogs-have-lost-teeth-more-than-20-times/)
    more than 20 times throughout their evolutionary history.

    to view a sample of interactive 3D models like the olive sea snake. Or go to [MorphoSource](https://www.morphosource.org/projects/000368762?locale=en)

    have used its 3D models to create realistic animal replicas, photos of oVert specimens
    have been displayed as museum exhibits, and specimens have been incorporated into
    VR headsets so users can interact with them. There appears to be no end to oVert’s
    uses.

    at the Florida Museum who’s working on [NoCTURN](https://nocturnetwork.org/) (Non-Clinical
    Tomography Users Research Network), a project developed near the end of oVert
    to make the best use of that project’s scans. “The aim of oVert was always to
    facilitate the exploration of vertebrate diversity. We’re going to keep exploring,
    but the goal of NoCTURN is to give people the tools to use the data, whether it’s
    for research, education or industry.”
