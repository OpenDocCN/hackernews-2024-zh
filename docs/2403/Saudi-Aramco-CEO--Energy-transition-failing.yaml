- en: HOUSTON — Saudi Aramco CEO Amin Nasser said Monday that the energy transition
    is failing and policymakers should abandon the "fantasy" of phasing out oil and
    gas, as demand for fossil fuels is expected to continue to grow in the coming
    years.

    last year that peak oil, gas and coal demand would come in 2030\. Nasser said
    demand is unlikely to peak anytime soon, let alone by that year. Nasser suggested
    that the IEA is focusing on demand in the U.S. and Europe and needs to focus on
    the developing world as well.

    at scale, despite the world investing more than $9.5 trillion over the past two
    decades. Wind and solar currently supply less than 4% of the world's energy, while
    total electric vehicle penetration is less than 3%, he said.

    in the 21st century from 83% to 80%, Nasser said. Global demand has increased
    by 100 million barrels of oil equivalent per day during the same period and will
    reach an all-time high this year, the CEO said.

    as prosperity rises in those nations, which represent more than 85% of the world's
    population, the CEO said. These nations receive less than 5% of the investment
    targeting renewable energy, he said.

    in addition to renewables. The CEO said efficiency improvements alone over the
    past 15 years have reduced global energy demand by almost 90 million barrels per
    day oil equivalent. Wind and solar, meanwhile, have substituted only 15 million
    barrels over the same period, he said.
