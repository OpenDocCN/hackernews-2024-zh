    sent a memo to all employees called “[Google’s Ideological Echo Chamber](https://www.jamesdamore.com/articles/googles-ideological-echo-chamber).”
    Damore argued that the company’s political bias toward the left “has created an
    ideological echo chamber where some ideas are too sacred to be honestly discussed.”
    Damore suggested, among other things, that “discriminating just to increase the
    representation of women in tech” was “misguided and biased.” Within a month, Google
    [fired](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/nov/16/james-damore-google-memo-interview-autism-regrets)
    him for “advancing harmful gender stereotypes.”

    $5.5 million) while only 12 percent (some $766,000) went to Republicans. But after
    Damore was ousted, Google’s corporate culture became even more radical, according
    to Maguire. “Damore’s firing emboldened them to push a more open ideological agenda,”
    he said.

    group demanded, needed to happen within six months. If leadership refused, about
    a quarter of the firm, or 20 people out of the 80 employees at Google Ventures,
    threatened to quit.”

    process normally takes anywhere between one to two years.”

    across Google, proved to be spineless in the face of these employee threats. Within
    a year, he hired a new female general partner, who was really smart but who wasn’t
    qualified for the job. Because of her lack of experience, she was never treated
    on the same level as the other general partners, which I believe was ultimately
    unfair to her.”
