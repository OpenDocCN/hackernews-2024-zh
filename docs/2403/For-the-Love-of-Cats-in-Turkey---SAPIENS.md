# For the Love of Cats in Turkey – SAPIENS

Just as important as these culturally specific factors, however, may well be qualities inherent to cats that drive people’s fascination with them. Cats seem to have a mind of their own, an inscrutability and imperviousness that make them at once fascinating and endearing.

Michael Gross, a science writer based at Oxford, [suggests this](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982220309908) has to do with how they co-evolved with humans: “Unlike dogs … which have been profoundly altered by breeding and the need to fit into human society, cats didn’t change that much compared with their wild ancestors and have kept their independent spirit.”

As with any kind of interspecies relationship, human-cat relations have not been without tensions. Among medieval Christians, cats were sometimes [treated with suspicion](https://theconversation.com/cats-in-the-middle-ages-what-medieval-manuscripts-teach-us-about-our-ancestors-pets-195389) because of their associations with paganism and witchcraft. In parts of Europe, people killed cats because of their supposed associations with the devil—leading to higher rat populations that likely encouraged the spread of the Black Death and other plagues in the Middle Ages.

Even in Turkey, historic examples show a distrust of cats, especially during disease outbreaks. During a [cholera scare in the 1830s](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00263206.2018.1432482), a “general crusade” led to cats being “shot without mercy.” Almost 200 years later, during the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, some people abandoned their pets—[including the otherwise-loved cats](https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/coronavirus-update-turkey-abandon-pets-fear-covid-19)—due to fears that the animals could spread disease.

Elsewhere around the world, the overpopulation of feral cats is now seen as a [major threat to wildlife](https://dlnr.hawaii.gov/hisc/info/invasive-species-profiles/feral-cats/#:~:text=Feral%2520cats%2520have%2520established%2520populations,of%2520Hawai'i's%2520unique%2520wildlife.). In Australia, the government has taken the controversial measure of [culling millions of feral cats](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/25/magazine/australia-cat-killing.html).

At least for now, the majority of Istanbul’s human residents seem unbothered by the over 100,000 cats in their city—though some see stray cats as out of step with their vision of Istanbul’s future as a “modern” city, as Hart’s research explores. And as [animal rights advocates](https://www.timeout.com/istanbul/news/the-inspiring-story-of-tails-of-istanbul-111720) and cat lovers point out, some community cats live in miserable conditions. In [an interview](https://www.trtworld.com/magazine/hit-film-about-istanbuls-cats-finally-comes-home-to-turkiye-12709129), Torun, the director of *Kedi*, acknowledged “the darker sides of cats’ lives in Istanbul, and the struggles that cat advocates or animal activists have” in caring for street animals.

Perhaps feline lovers in Turkey can take heart, however, in recent events that suggest the special bond between cats and humans remains strong. During last year’s earthquake in Turkey, news reports featured stories of people going to great lengths to [rescue cats](https://www.livemint.com/news/world/save-my-cat-before-pulling-me-out-turkey-quake-victim-watch-the-moment-11675994072460.html) caught in rubble. Some cats repaid the favor by [refusing to leave](https://www.ndtv.com/offbeat/turkey-earthquake-rescued-cat-refuses-to-leave-man-who-saved-it-3795134) their rescuers’ sides.
