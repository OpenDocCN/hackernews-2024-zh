- en: '**New York, NY, March 12, 2024** – ACM, the Association for Computing Machinery,
    has relaunched *Communications of the ACM* (CACM), the organization’s flagship
    magazine, as a web-first publication, accessible to everyone without charge. First
    published in 1958, CACM is one of the most respected information technology magazines.
    Providing news, expert commentary, and peer-reviewed research, CACM straddles
    the lines between a popular science magazine, a technical resource for industry
    professionals, and a scientific journal. CACM regularly receives very high “impact
    factors”—a metric used in academic publishing to gauge a publication’s influence
    within its designated field.'

    so that readers can keep abreast of the lightning-fast changes in the computing
    field. At the same time, researchers will be able to reference and cite valuable
    information and research from CACM articles more quickly. The reengineered website
    will also allow CACM authors to publish longer articles and make greater use of
    video and other multimedia content. And CACM will be even more user-friendly with
    improved search capabilities, more interactivity, simplified categorization of
    articles in new sections, daily content updates, and a modern, spacious design
    that lends itself to all devices.

- en: In relaunching *Communications of the ACM* as an open access publication, all
    legacy and future CACM articles will be freely available to and accessible by
    everyone on the CACM website and in the ACM Digital Library. By opening CACM to
    the world, ACM hopes to increase engagement with the broader computer science
    community and encourage computing professionals and students everywhere to discover
    its rich resources and benefits. This will also benefit CACM authors by expanding
    their readership to a larger and more diverse audience. The community’s continued
    support of ACM through membership and the ACM Open model is essential to keeping
    ACM and CACM strong.

    innovators in computing and information technology,” explained ACM President Yannis
    Ioannidis, a Professor at the University of Athens. “It also provides a critical
    outlet for researchers and practitioners to showcase their work. We believe the
    entire global computing community will benefit enormously by using CACM as a forum
    for presenting and discussing the most significant new ideas and results. We also
    believe that CACM’s web-first, open platform will showcase once again the leadership
    position of ACM in advancing the art, science, engineering, and application of
    computing by fostering the open exchange of information, and inspiring many more
    computing professionals to engage with and benefit from the rich spectrum of ACM
    activities.”

    audience,” explained CACM Editor-in-Chief James Larus. “Computing has grown enormously,
    with many tech publications and blogs. But most of them are aimed at a broad audience
    and do not delve into technical details. All computing professionals, whether
    they are an entry-level software engineer at a multinational corporation, a video
    game developer, or a computer scientist at a university, can stay current on the
    developments in the very broad field of computing by regularly reading CACM. Like
    those of us who are long-time ACM members, I am confident our new readers will
    visit the CACM website regularly.”

- en: Larus, a Professor Emeritus at EPFL in Lausanne, Switzerland, also predicted
    continued success for CACM. “As always, we listen to what our community needs
    and wants in a computing publication,” he added. “For that reason, the print version
    is not going away because many members like it. Even as we change the publication
    model, the foundation of CACM remains strong as ACM has sufficient resources to
    support a high-quality editorial process. We recognize that CACM’s 65-year legacy
    of excellence is made possible by its dedicated staff and volunteers and, of course,
    our authors and readers. I strongly encourage everyone to submit their best work
    to CACM so that the rest of the field can see it!”
