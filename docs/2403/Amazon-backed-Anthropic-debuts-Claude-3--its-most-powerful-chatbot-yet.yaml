- en: Anthropic on Monday debuted Claude 3, a suite of artificial intelligence models
    that it says are its fastest and most powerful yet. The new tools are called Claude
    3 Opus, Sonnet and Haiku.

    OpenAI's GPT-4 and Google's Gemini Ultra on industry benchmark tests, such as
    undergraduate level knowledge, graduate level reasoning and basic mathematics.

    Opus. Sonnet and Opus are available in 159 countries starting Monday, while Haiku
    will be coming soon, according to Anthropic. The company declined to specify how
    long it took to train Claude 3 or how much it cost, but it said companies like
    Airtable and Asana helped A/B test the models.

    founded by ex-OpenAI research executives. It had completed Series A and B funding
    rounds, but it had only rolled out the first version of its chatbot without any
    consumer access or major fanfare.

    book (think: around the length range of "Moby Dick" or "Harry Potter and the Deathly
    Hallows"). Its previous version could only summarize 75,000 words. Users can input
    large data sets, and ask for summaries in the form of a memo, letter or story.
    ChatGPT, by contrast, can handle about 3,000 words.'

    bit conservative in responding to those questions."'

    "If you think about the way we as humans process the world and engage with the
    world, we see things, we hear things, we say things — the world is much bigger
    than text. So to us, it always felt incomplete for text and code to be the single
    modalities, the single interfaces that we could have to how powerful these models
    are and what they can do."'
