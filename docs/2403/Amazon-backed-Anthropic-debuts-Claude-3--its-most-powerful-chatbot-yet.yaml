- en: Anthropic on Monday debuted Claude 3, a suite of artificial intelligence models
    that it says are its fastest and most powerful yet. The new tools are called Claude
    3 Opus, Sonnet and Haiku.

    OpenAI's GPT-4 and Google's Gemini Ultra on industry benchmark tests, such as
    undergraduate level knowledge, graduate level reasoning and basic mathematics.

    photos, charts, documents and other types of unstructured data for analysis and

    Opus. Sonnet and Opus are available in 159 countries starting Monday, while Haiku
    will be coming soon, according to Anthropic. The company declined to specify how
    long it took to train Claude 3 or how much it cost, but it said companies like
    Airtable and Asana helped A/B test the models.

- en: This time last year, Anthropic was seen as a promising generative AI startup
    founded by ex-OpenAI research executives. It had completed Series A and B funding
    rounds, but it had only rolled out the first version of its chatbot without any
    consumer access or major fanfare.

    Google, Salesforce and Amazon, and a product that directly competes with ChatGPT
    in both the enterprise and consumer worlds. Over the past year, the startup closed
    five different funding deals, totaling about $7.3 billion.

    billion invested across nearly 700 deals in 2023, a more than 260% increase in
    deal value from a year earlier, according to PitchBook. It's become the buzziest
    phrase on [corporate earnings calls](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/02/02/techs-new-ai-game-plan-spend-money-to-make-money.html) quarter
    after quarter. Academics and ethicists have [voiced significant concerns](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/03/29/elon-musk-other-tech-leaders-pause-training-ai-beyond-gpt-4.html) about
    the technology's tendency to propagate bias, but even so, it's quickly made its
    way into schools, online travel, the medical industry, online advertising and
    more.

    150 people worked on its technical aspects, Anthropic co-founder Daniela Amodei
    told CNBC in an interview. For the AI model's [last iteration](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/07/11/anthropic-an-openai-rival-opens-claude-2-ai-chatbot-to-the-public.html),
    a team of 30 to 35 people worked directly on it, with about 150 people total supporting
    it, Amodei told CNBC in July.

    book (think: around the length range of "Moby Dick" or "Harry Potter and the Deathly
    Hallows"). Its previous version could only summarize 75,000 words. Users can input
    large data sets, and ask for summaries in the form of a memo, letter or story.
    ChatGPT, by contrast, can handle about 3,000 words.'

    Amodei told CNBC. "When somebody would kind of bump up against some of the spicier
    topics or the trust and safety guardrails, sometimes Claude 2 would trend a little
    bit conservative in responding to those questions."'

    "If you think about the way we as humans process the world and engage with the
    world, we see things, we hear things, we say things — the world is much bigger
    than text. So to us, it always felt incomplete for text and code to be the single
    modalities, the single interfaces that we could have to how powerful these models
    are and what they can do."'

    risks. Google recently took its AI image generator, part of its Gemini chatbot,

    are going to be places where the model still makes something up from time to time."'
