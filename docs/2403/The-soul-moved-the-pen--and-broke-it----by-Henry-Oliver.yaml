- en: Flaubert lost his virginity by raping a servant after the sight of a woman breastfeeding
    in the park drove him so crazy that he kissed the woman’s dog, whispered to the
    animal what he wished he could whisper to her, and then burst into tears. He frequently
    collapsed unconscious, suffering from a mysterious condition that his doctor father
    couldn’t diagnose. As a young man, he deliberately dropped those friends whose
    Romanticism wasn’t deep and genuine, but was instead a mere expression of their
    youthful exuberance. When he saw Breughel’s *Temptation of Saint Anthony* he fell
    into such a long, unresponsive rapture, his sister became nervous and wondered
    if she should bring him round. She didn’t, because such raptures were common for
    Flaubert, who often spent hours staring out of windows.

- en: What can criticism do for an artist like Flaubert? At 116,000 words, written
    over four years and seven months, *Madame Bovary* was produced, if such a calculation
    can mean anything, at a rate of fewer than seventy words a day. To perfect each
    sentence like a line of verse, Flaubert wept and howled, collapsed in palpitations
    and wrote in spurts of joy; many of his sentences, he shouted out loud to himself.
    He called his study his *gueuloir*, his bellowing place. (He is not known as the
    bear of Croisset for nothing.) The novel has only just been born, he declared
    in a letter, and it awaits its Homer. To make himself worthy of that great task,
    Flaubert felt what seems to have been every possible feeling. He exhausted himself
    living out the emotional life of his novel so that he might perfect his sentences.
    He used to tell people, *Madame Bovary, c’est moi.* And he meant it. Truly, the
    soul moved the pen, and broke it.

    in the brothel, not even putting down his cigar during the act, because of his
    cynical attitude towards transient beauty. “I have violent sensual appetites,”

    every small detail, even the movement of toes within silk slippers, tell as part
    of the story. Everything plays a part in establishing the conditions of Emma’s
    downfall, of showing the tension, of indicating the characters’ psychologies.'

- en: Flaubert’s letters are so fascinating because they are full of his writing advice.
    “If having sensitive nerves were sufficient qualification for being a poet, I
    would be better than Shakespeare,” he told his lover, the poet Louise Colet. But
    our own passions are insufficient. “The more personal you are, the weaker.” This
    later became a dictum of aestheticism, as in Oscar Wilde’s aphorism, “All bad
    poetry springs from genuine feeling. To be natural is to be obvious, and to be
    obvious is to be inartistic.”

  zh: 福楼拜的信件之所以如此迷人，是因为其中充满了他的写作建议。“如果仅仅拥有敏感的神经就足以成为诗人的资格，我比莎士比亚更好，”他告诉他的诗人情人卢易丝·科莱。但我们自己的激情是不够的。“你越个人化，就越脆弱。”
    这后来成为美学主义的格言，如奥斯卡·王尔德的箴言：“所有糟糕的诗歌都来源于真实的感受。自然是显而易见的，显而易见就是不艺术化。”
- en: But in the letter where he wrote that, Flaubert wasn’t merely setting out principles
    of literature. He was critiquing the inadequacies of his lover’s poetry. His detachment
    for the sake of art knew no boundaries, especially not the feelings of Louise
    Colet.

- en: The less you feel a thing, Flaubert told Colet, the more capable you are of
    expressing it. To merely write out your emotions, is, to Flaubert, hardly to write
    at all. It is not to make Art, not to prioritise style, not to make sacral the
    aesthetic. *Everything* is style, he insisted.

- en: But, as we saw, Flaubert often did write in great tempests of emotion. That
    is because, he told Louise, “one must be able *to make oneself feel it*.” To create
    style, you must not have the raw material guttering out onto the page, but you
    must be able create or summon the material, so that you can capture it, stylise
    it. You don’t need feelings but “the ability to *see*, to have the model posing

- en: Flaubert’s manic mood cycles enabled him to see, so that he might create a new
    style. This new style “would be as rhythmic as verse, precise as the language

    there dazed, bogged in a swamp of despair, hating myself and blaming myself for

    right to feel ignored and used. The manias might have seemed exhaustingly selfish—*“So
    what the devil do you want me to talk to you about if not Shakespeare, if not
    what lies closest to my heart?”*, Flaubert asks at the start of one letter—and
    perhaps it was scant redress that Louise was receiving some of literature’s greatest
    letters. We can marvel from a safe distance at lines like, “If you knew all the
    invisible nets that keep my physically inactive, all the mists that float in my

    that made Flaubert as he was.

    fascinating and repellent. Though Flaubert wrote Louise one hundred letters, he
    only visited her six times. He was busy studying Greek, he told her, or had just

    style is a moral good, by provoking what Sontag called “the enlivening of our

    它代表了意识，最高的文学美德。
- en: That representation was precisely Flaubert’s aim. Consciousness had expanded,
    he believed, since the days of Homer, and new forms were needed. He was especially
    pleased when a local dignitary said something, almost word for word, that he had
    only recently written into the mouth of a minor character. That was the scientific
    precision he sought. But to represent consciousness, he had to pull so much out

- en: It would be trite to say that Flaubert was his own sacrificial victim, though
    that may have been his view. In a long justification, and celebration, of his

    said, was to miss something of life. “We cannot always live with our noses pointed
