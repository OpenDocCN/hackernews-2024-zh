    Sure, it won't be complete integration or cross-platform compatibility. You'll
    be able to message – with undo-send, edits, and full-resolution photos and videos
    – with all your Android friends, but only from within a separate iPhone RCS messaging
    app. RCS messages will not appear, it seems, inside of iMessage. In other words,
    it may feel a bit like messaging in [WhatsApp](https://www.techradar.com/tag/whatsapp)
    on an iPhone. Even so, Apple's not blocking the idea.

    its sweet time in adding WearOS support to the iPhone? Yes, and one wonders if
    it'll ever do so.

    I agree, this is a problem. On the other hand, I don't believe companies should

    a good market/business reason, existing standards, or significant consumer demand.

    full-stack control, from silicon to components to platform to consumer hardware,
    is almost unmatched in the industry. The Apple ecosystem, and the considerable
    consumer benefits it offers, springs directly from that control.

    a monopolistic player. There's only one way to get iOS apps, and developers have
    had to pay as much as 30% of their customer revenue to Apple for the privilege.
    Apple has walked back some of these fees, and many smaller developers pay half
    that much, Elsewhere, the [EU has chipped away at Apple's exclusionary tactics](https://www.techradar.com/phones/apples-big-ios-and-app-store-changes-explained-7-things-you-need-to-know),

    Sora Apps' (OpenAI has yet to publicly release a [Sora](https://www.techradar.com/computing/artificial-intelligence/openai-sora)

    vs. Epic Games](https://www.techradar.com/news/apple-vs-epic-games-trial-dates-details-and-what-is-freefortnite)).

    just for itself. Most people I talk to willingly choose the iPhone, and not because

    Phones for their own idiosyncratic reasons. No one is trapped, stuck, or more

    should it be in the position of making technology choices for tech companies or
    their customers. Suppose the US Government wins, and it does start making those
    choices. It would be fixing a problem that doesn't exist, and that no consumer
    asked it to fix, while also potentially ruining the relationships with companies
    and their products which most consumers currently enjoy.
