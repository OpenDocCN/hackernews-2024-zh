    teenager can’t get enough of them. He’s not a trainspotter, though. He’s more
    of a train*squatter*.

    on trains, he does so entirely legally. And with a surprising amount of comfort.

    recently. ‘At night I sleep on the moving Intercity Express (ICE) train and during
    the day I sit in a seat, at a table and work as a programmer, surrounded by many
    other commuters and passengers. I travel from one end of the country to the other.
    I’m exploring the whole of Germany.’

    now fully back their son’s decision.
