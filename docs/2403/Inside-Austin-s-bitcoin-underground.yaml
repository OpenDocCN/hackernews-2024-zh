    second floor of the Littlefield Building at the corner of Congress Avenue and
    Sixth Street. The hideaway is at the crossroads of two worlds — the majestic thoroughfare
    that leads to the Texas State Capitol and the iconic, albeit notorious, stretch
    of bars, restaurants, and live music that define the capital's party vibes. It's
    an apt metaphor for the space itself.
