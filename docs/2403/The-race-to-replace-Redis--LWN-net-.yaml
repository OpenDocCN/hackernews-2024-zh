    "<q>in-memory data store</q>" project would now be released under non-free, source-available
    licenses, starting with Redis 7.4\. The news is unwelcome, but not entirely unexpected.
    What is unusual with this situation is the number of Redis alternatives to choose
    from; there are at least four options to choose as a replacement for those who
    wish to stay with free software, including a pre-existing fork called [KeyDB](https://docs.keydb.dev/)
    and the Linux Foundation's newly-announced [Valkey](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/press/linux-foundation-launches-open-source-valkey-community)
    project. The question now is which one(s) Linux distributions, users, and providers
    will choose to take its place.

    Salvatore Sanfilippo (also known as "antirez") started the project to use as "<q>a
    different kind of database</q>" with a realtime log-analyzer application called
    [LLOOGG](https://github.com/antirez/lloogg), because MySQL was not meeting his
    needs. Instead of creating a relational database, he designed the project as a
    simple dictionary database that stored a key-value pair in memory—its name is
    a contraction of "remote dictionary server". It has, of course, matured and accrued
    [many more features](https://redis.io/docs/about/) over the years. Redis quickly
    became popular as part of the [NoSQL movement](http://radar.oreilly.com/2012/02/nosql-non-relational-database.html),
    and he was hired by VMware to work on Redis development in 2010\. He moved to
    VMware's spin-off, Pivotal, in 2013 and continued to work on the project.

    the [Server Side Public License](https://www.mongodb.com/licensing/server-side-public-license)

    the issue on openSUSE's Factory discussion list. Dominique Leuenberger [replied](https://lwn.net/ml/opensuse-factory/3873a1ecbc97440ff0db7fb28b0c6f079b7a6649.camel@opensuse.org/)
    with a list of 18 packages with dependencies on the `redis` package in Tumbleweed.
    The initial discussion mentioned Redict and KeyDB as possible replacements, but
    Valkey had not been announced yet.

- en: Having to find a replacement to ship in place of Redis is not the only problem
    for community distributions. Jacob Michalskie [called out](https://lwn.net/ml/opensuse-factory/AB7886BD-E33E-4ACA-8F94-AA4A1B1FECDB@opensuse.org/)
    several services in use by the openSUSE project that will need a Redis replacement,
    including the [Pagure](https://pagure.io/pagure) code-hosting software (created
    and used by Fedora as well) used for [code.opensuse.org](https://code.opensuse.org/),
    and the [Discourse](https://www.discourse.org/) forum software.

    a [Request for Package](https://wiki.debian.org/RFP) (RFP) for KeyDB as a potential
    replacement for Redis. Jover said he was not sure if he was up for sole maintainership,
    but was happy to give a hand. In an email exchange with Jover, he told me that
    his company had migrated from Redis 6 to KeyDB and it was a "smooth transition".
    According to Jover, "KeyDB might be lacking some features compared to Redis 7,
    but we have neither noticed we miss any or felt we were missing out on anything."

    to be maintained, and that Redict's LGPLv3 licensing "might also be problematic
    for the ecosystem". In a follow-up email after the Valkey announcement, he said
    "I think we'll probably go further with packaging KeyDB for Debian at least, if
    it dies out it can always be removed or transitioned out from there."

- en: It is, of course, too soon to predict whether one or more of the forks will
    gain significant traction—but it seems likely that Valkey will be a credible alternative.
    The possibility of a swift fork with widespread community and industry backing
    should give pause to vendors who expect a smooth path after abandoning open source.
