    will try to work from its current licensing policies, yet users should stick to
    their contracts with the global tech giant.'

    based on the Ts and Cs of the signed agreements, not on what their current arrangements

- en: A user of Oracle since the 1980s, the company was on the receiving end of an
    audit from the enterprise application and database supplier in 2019\. With a long
    history with Oracle, some of the relevant contract arrangements went back to 1999,
    Cohoon told a webinar hosted by Palisade Compliance, a specialist advisory company
    helping clients deal with Oracle licenses.

    based on our agreements or our contracts. We had a 1999 agreement, but they wanted
    to measure us against you know, 2019 licensing arrangements. So there was a there
    was a bit of disconnect on expectations," he told the audience.'

    have the right to audit you. Everything else they tell you to do is subject to
    interpretation, including the speed of doing things. We always suggest that you
    take control [of the timetable]. In most cases, people don''t understand that
    you have 45 days before you have to meet with Oracle from the day you get the
    letter," he said.'

    and say you have to run the [licensing audit] scripts. What you want to do is
    understand where you are before you give any data to Oracle," he said.'

    and one which might generate up to $3 billion a year.

    compliant" after the 2019 audit. But it also took the opportunity to prepare for
    the next quizzing from Oracle.

    in 2019\. Earlier last year, [it made changes](https://www.theregister.com/2023/01/27/oracle_java_licensing_change/)
    to the Oracle Java SE subscription model, basing it on a per-employee metric many
    said would increase costs for users. For example, Gartner estimated the [new subscription
    model](https://www.theregister.com/2023/07/24/oracle_java_license_terms/) to be
    two to five times more expensive than the legacy model.
