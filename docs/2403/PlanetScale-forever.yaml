- en: PlanetScale is an infrastructure company. Our service is mission critical, and
    we value reliability above all else. Reliability isn’t just an uptime percentage
    on your status page. It means your business is self-sustaining. Every unprofitable
    company has a date in the future where it could disappear. With an ever changing
    world and economy, this is a situation fraught with risk. We’ve chosen to build
    a company that can last forever. This is why I have made the decision to prioritize
    profitability for PlanetScale.

    decisions: to part ways with members of our team (primarily Sales and Marketing)
    and sunsetting our Hobby plan. I would like to express my extreme gratitude for
    the people we are parting ways with today.'

    about the plan deprecation, such as exporting your data or upgrading, in our [Hobby
    plan FAQ documentation](/docs/concepts/hobby-plan-deprecation-faq).

    space is full of unnecessary hype. We are opting out. Our technology is proven
    among some of the world’s largest tech companies. We do not need to give away
    endless amounts of free resources in order to keep growing.
