    & pickle-based system](https://www.flickr.com/photos/nickgray/378694469) that
    chefs at the Waffle House use to “store” all of the orders that come in for food
    during service, but I can’t find it in the archive. But no matter — the Waffle
    House training video above runs us through their whole system, including a detailed
    explanation of their Magic Marker System, which involves zero actual Magic Markers
    and instead is about arranging condiment packets and other items on plates in
    a code:'

    have the same four positions: ham, sausage, bacon, and plain. To mark a sandwich,
    place two pickle slices in the appropriate position. Here you can see I put two
    pickle slices in the number three position, which tells me this is a bacon sandwich.
    If I add a slice of cheese to the plate, I know this is a bacon cheese sandwich.
    To make this a bacon, egg, and cheese sandwich, I’ll add this right side up mayo
    packet to the right side of the plate.'

    plate you know this is a sandwich. When marking a sandwich, this mayo packet and
    pickles means a sandwich with eggs. If a customer wanted the eggs on their sandwich
    to be scrambled instead of the standard over well egg, I’d move this mayo pack
    down to the bottom of the plate to show that the egg is scrambled.

    system over the years, but I bet it works really well in practice and cuts down
    on errors. I love stuff like this…seeing how different organizations manage their
    core processes, especially in non-conventional ways. See also [Nightclub Hand
    Signals](https://kottke.org/09/03/nightclub-hand-signals) and [The Quarryman’s
    Symphony](https://kottke.org/14/10/the-quarrymans-symphony). (thx, erik)
