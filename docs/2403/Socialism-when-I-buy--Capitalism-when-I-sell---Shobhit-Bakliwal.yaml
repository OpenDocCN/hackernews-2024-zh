    shade on anyone particular because this is a cultural thing rather than a few,
    so don’t think that I have someone specific in mind, but rather the archetype
    of me and people around me.

    that you need to use in-app billing for some categories. Everyone knows it, Google
    had made it very clear. Yet, people were flouting those rules and billing customers
    with their own Payment Gateways.

    does enforce the terms, so these apps have to use in-app billing on iOS, which
    they do!

    allow you to use a different payment gateway, big apps like Dream11 and MPL have
    been working this way and have become huge companies.
