- en: In 1600 a Dutch galleon arrived on the shores of a small fief on Kyushu, the
    westernmost of Japan’s four main islands. It was the first Dutch ship to reach
    Japan. Among the crew was an English navigator, William Adams, who managed to
    gain the trust of Tokugawa Ieyasu, a powerful warlord who became a shogun (the
    military leader of the samurai caste) in 1603\. Adams eventually rose to the rank
    of Hatamoto, the shogun’s direct retainer. How did an English navigator come to
    serve the shogun? To answer this, we must first look at the situation in Japan
    at the time and the policies of Ieyasu.

- en: 'By 1600 Japan had endured several centuries of warfare, known as the Sengoku
    period (Sengoku means ‘the country at war’). Originally ruled by the emperor in
    Kyoto, from the 12th century the shogunate had ruled the country, leaving the
    emperor with only nominal power. However, as the influence of the Ashikaga shoguns
    waned the country descended into chaos, with numerous warlords vying for supremacy.
    In the middle of the 16th century, great unifiers appeared: first Oda Nobunaga
    and then Toyotomi Hideyoshi. The latter succeeded in uniting the country under
    his own rule, but died in 1598, leaving an infant son, Hideyori, and a council
    of five regents to govern until Hideyori came of age.'

    battle that removed his major opponents, he founded the Tokugawa Shogunate and
    was appointed as shogun. In this capacity he was able to rule the country alone.
    International relations became an important concern of his rule. Portugal had
    been trading with Japan since the 1540s. Through the influence of the Jesuits,
    who accompanied the Portuguese merchants and had some success in spreading their
    gospel, they had obtained a safe harbour at Nagasaki, on the west coast of Kyushu.
    Every year a huge Portuguese carrack sailed from Macau to Nagasaki carrying almost
    a year’s worth of Chinese silk goods for Japan’s clothing industry. To prevent
    Japanese pirates, Chinese were banned from sailing to Japan and Japanese from
    entering China. This played into the hands of the Portuguese: they had a virtual
    monopoly on the import of goods into Japan and were thus able to control prices.'

- en: Aware that such a foreign monopoly was not in his country’s interests Ieyasu
    tried to reduce his dependence on Portuguese traders. He sent junks to Patani
    and other ports in East Asia to buy Chinese silk and even began negotiations with
    the Spanish in the Philippines. The junks were unable to buy large quantities,
    though, and the Spanish were more interested in sending missionaries than in trading.
    This was all the more worrying as Ieyasu was concerned about the growing influence
    of Christians in his territories. It was at this crucial moment that Adams arrived
    in Japan.

- en: During the war with the Iberian countries (c.1567-1648) the Dutch were deprived
    of the Asian products they had been buying in Lisbon and so began to send fleets
    to Asia to obtain these products directly. Adams was one of several Englishmen
    to sail with these fleets, leaving Rotterdam in 1598\. He had served in the queen’s
    fleet and had been employed by the Barbary Company for about ten years, making
    him a perfect candidate to navigate one of the five Dutch ships. Yet even with
    an experienced crew the voyage proved disastrous. After two years of misery, only
    Adams’ ship reached Japan. Of a crew of 100, only 18 survived.

    the magistrates to execute the remaining crew members as pirates. But Ieyasu refused
    and had Adams and Jan Joosten Lodenstein, a Dutch crewman, brought to Osaka for
    questioning. Far from having them killed, he made the two men his advisers on
    international affairs.

- en: It seems that Adams’ answers to Ieyasu’s questions (preserved in the letters
    Adams wrote afterwards) made a good impression. At their first meeting Ieyasu
    asked, through a Portuguese-speaking interpreter, where Adams was from and what
    had prompted him to travel so far. Adams showed Ieyasu England on a map and told
    him that his country desired friendship through trade with all the kings of Asia.
    Ieyasu asked if England was at war. Yes, Adams replied, with Spain and Portugal,
    and at peace with all other nations. Asked how they had come to Japan, Adams showed
    the map again and explained that they had sailed through the Strait of Magellan;
    at first this made Ieyasu suspicious because he did not know the Earth was round.
    In the end, Adams advocated free trade and a win-win relationship between friendly
    nations – music to the ears of Ieyasu, who wanted to end the Portuguese monopoly.
    After three meetings, Adams was released, but was not allowed to leave the country.
    Ieyasu employed him to learn about the world and mathematics.

    English trading post at Hirado, a small island off the north-west coast of Japan,
    effectively breaking the Portuguese monopoly. With the help of the other survivors
    from his ship, he also built two small galleons for Ieyasu. Ieyasu’s shipwrights
    were able to acquire Western shipbuilding techniques, which they applied to the
    construction of sea-going junks, giving a new impetus to Japanese expansion in
    the East Asian market. Adams also acted as a broker for the shogun in the purchase
    of Western cannon, lead cannonballs and iron sand for the manufacture of Japanese
    swords. The cannon proved to be one of the decisive factors in the Siege of Osaka
    (1614-15), in which Ieyasu defeated Hideyori and established the Tokugawa supremacy
    that would last for 250 years.

    ‘This Mr Adams is esteemed by Ieyasu as a prince or potentate because of his learning
    and sincerity. He is entitled to converse directly and intimately with his highness.
    This is a great help to us, as few people are allowed to do so.’ Ieyasu was keen
    to employ people of ability and honesty, even if they were not members of the
    samurai caste. It seems that he favoured Adams because of his knowledge and impartiality,
    even trying, in 1616, to keep him in the country when Adams asked to leave.'

- en: After Ieyasu’s death in 1616, his son Hidetada took over and surrounded himself
    with his own favourites. He followed a very different course from his father.
    Conservative by nature, he reversed Ieyasu’s policy of free trade. Above all,
    he wanted to consolidate Tokugawa rule and eliminate all foreign influence. This
    proved fatal to Adams’ position. With his special status as a retainer of the
    shogun, Adams was still allowed to travel freely in Japan, unlike other foreigners.
    He used this privilege to help the English trading post, but a series of incidents
    made it clear that the power he once had under Ieyasu’s rule was no more. Only
    four years after Ieyasu’s death, Adams himself died, aged 56, in Hirado, far from
    the capital.
