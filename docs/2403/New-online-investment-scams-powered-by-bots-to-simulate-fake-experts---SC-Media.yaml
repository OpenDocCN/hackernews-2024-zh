- en: Some new online investment scams are no longer impersonating real companies
    in phishing attacks, but rather the company name, registration details and promised
    high return rates are entirely fake.

    of product strategy at Netcraft. “The money involved in a successful campaign
    might range up from [thousands of dollars] from each victim, and the victim intentionally
    sends money in connection with the scam. Depending on the jurisdiction, banks
    may treat this quite differently to authorized payments made in other types of
    scams.”

    and institutions, albeit with varying scale and impact. While individual consumers
    often bear the brunt of financial losses resulting from these fraudulent schemes,
    institutions may face risks such as reputational damage if impersonated or their
    stakeholders are affected, said Duncan.

    that banks are on-the-hook for losses in such scams,” explained Duncan. “Collaboration
    with regulatory bodies and industry partners is essential to disrupting this threat.”

    Netcraft researchers pointed out that online investment scams have emerged as
    a global threat. These scams promise very high returns with no risks attached,
    and often claim to deliver “once-in-a-lifetime” opportunities for investors to
    make guaranteed returns overnight. The reseachers noted that in claiming to trade
    in forex, cryptocurrency, or other high-risk assets, the unsuspecting investor
    (victim) needs only to make an initial payment to take advantage. These guarantees
    are meaningless, the claimed investment is a sham, and the victim loses their
    money.

    month](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2024/02/nationwide-fraud-losses-top-10-billion-2023-ftc-steps-efforts-protect-public),
    the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) attributed more than $4.6 billion of U.S. fraud
    losses in 2023 to investment scams, more than any other fraud category. And, the
    FBI’s 2023 [Internet Crime Report](https://www.ic3.gov/Media/PDF/AnnualReport/2023_IC3Report.pdf)
    noted that investment scams were “once again the costliest type of [crime tracked
    by IC3](https://www.scmagazine.com/news/fbi-cybercrime-cost-americans-over-12-5b-in-2023).”

    websites and financial dashboards, to mimic real investment opportunities,” said
    Ted Miracco, chief executive officer at Approov. “This approach makes the scam
    extremely convincing as it involves interactive elements such as manipulated trading
    results and fake customer support, rather than straightforward impersonation or
    false claims. The scammers are now using the same marketing innovations as tech
    startups, except their end product is financial loss and deception.”

- en: What sets one of these scams apart is their use of bots to simulate group chats
    with fake experts, creating an illusion of legitimate investment opportunities,
    explained Mika Aalto, co-founder and CEO at Hoxhunt. The attack combines our trust
    in and use of social media with our natural tendencies to trust authority figures,
    seek group validation, and pursue easy rewards, said Aalto. The peer pressure
    tactic has been used for a long time in multi-level marketing events and dubious
    timeshare property dinners, where actors are planted in the event to build a sense
    of community and pressure to act.

- en: “Unlike traditional impersonation scams, these schemes create an entire ecosystem
    of deceit, offering not just a fake promise but a fake community and support system,”
    said Aalto. “This sophisticated approach to cybercrime highlights the dangers
    of combining psychological manipulation with the lure of significant financial
    gain, making it a particularly potent threat. In the future, with the use of AI-powered
    bots rather than script-following bots, these communities will be even harder
    to expose as fraudulent.”

    real-looking financial application, and the ability to abuse our desire to get
    rich overnight, said Krishna Vishnubhotla, vice president of product strategy
    at Zimperium. Mobile devices, messaging, and social apps will only intensify the
    threat of online investment scams as they are omnipresent in daily life, providing
    continuous access for scammers to potential victims, said Vishunbhotla.

    individuals, which is really scary,” said Vishnubhotla. “Cloning legitimate financial
    applications and distributing them via phishing and third-party stores is easier
    than ever today. Since we inherently trust our personal devices, these fraudulent
    schemes will spread rapidly. Cybercriminals can execute sophisticated social engineering
    tactics and interact with individuals more directly and convincingly, thereby
    increasing the efficiency and reach of these scams.”
