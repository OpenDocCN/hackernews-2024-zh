    a sphere and hence destroyed its rather complicated generating equipment at the
    instant of formation. This meant, of course, that it could not be used on warships

    natural one, for it seemed to us then that all our existing weapons had become

    What we did not appreciate was the magnitude of the task we were attempting, and

    of torpedo had to be designed, as the standard model was too small. This meant
    in turn that only the larger ships could launch the weapon, but we were prepared
    to accept this penalty. After six months, the heavy units of the Fleet were being
    equipped with the Sphere. Training maneuvers and tests had shown that it was operating
    satisfactorily and we were ready to take it into action. Norden was already being

- en: Then two things happened. One of our battleships disappeared completely on a
    training flight, and an investigation showed that under certain conditions the
    ship’s long-range radar could trigger the Sphere immediately after it had been
    launched. The modification needed to overcome this defect was trivial, but it
    caused a delay of another month and was the source of much bad feeling between
    the naval staff and the scientists. We were ready for action again—when Norden
    announced that the radius of effectiveness of the Sphere had now been increased
    by ten, thus multiplying by a thousand the chances of destroying an enemy ship.

    would be worth it. Meanwhile, however, the enemy had been emboldened by the absence
    of further attacks and had made an unexpected onslaught. Our ships were short
    of torpedoes, since none had been coming from the factories, and were forced to

    we found that the numbers ranged against us were often 100 percent greater than
    expected, causing target confusion among the automatic weapons and resulting in
    higher losses than anticipated. The enemy losses were higher still, for once a

    matter, he said, if the enemy had twice as many ships as we—if the efficiency
    of ours could be doubled or even trebled? For decades the limiting factor in warfare
    had been not mechanical but biological—it had become more and more difficult for
    any single mind, or group of minds, to cope with the rapidly changing complexities
    of battle in three-dimensional space. Norden’s mathematicians had analyzed some
    of the classic engagements of the past, and had shown that even when we had been

    that had happened. The difficulty was that Norden had proved every one of his
    claims: he had a perfect excuse for all the disasters that had occurred. And we
    could not now turn back—the search for an irresistible weapon must go on. At first
    it had been a luxury that would shorten the war. Now it was a necessity if we
    were to end it victoriously.'

- en: We were wrong. The final weapon was something so fantastic that even now it
    seems difficult to believe that it ever existed. Its innocent, noncommittal name—The
    Exponential Field—gave no hint of its real potentialities. Some of Norden’s mathematicians
    had discovered it during a piece of entirely theoretical research into the properties
    of space, and to everyone’s great surprise their results were found to be physically
    realizable.

- en: It seems very difficult to explain the operation of the Field to the layman.
    According to the technical description, it “produces an exponential condition
    of space, so that a finite distance in normal, linear space may become infinite
    in pseudo-space.” Norden gave an analogy which some of us found useful. It was
    as if one took a flat disk of rubber—representing a region of normal space—and
    then pulled its center out to infinity. The circumference of the disk would be
    unaltered—but its “diameter” would be infinite. That was the sort of thing the
    generator of the Field did to the space around it.

    诺登提出了一个比喻，我们中的一些人觉得很有用。这就好像拿起一块橡皮圆盘——代表普通空间的一个区域——然后将其中心拉到无限远。圆盘的周长不变——但其“直径”是无限的。发电机对其周围空间所做的事情就是这样。
- en: 'As an example, suppose that a ship carrying the generator was surrounded by
    a ring of hostile machines. If it switched on the Field, each of the enemy ships
    would think that it—and the ships on the far side of the circle—had suddenly receded
    into nothingness. Yet the circumference of the circle would be the same as before:
    only the journey to the center would be of infinite duration, for as one proceeded,
    distances would appear to become greater and greater as the “scale” of space altered.'

    ship carrying the Field: it might be englobed by an enemy fleet yet would be as
    inaccessible as if it were at the other side of the Universe. Against this, of
    course, it could not fight back without switching off the Field, but this still
    left it at a very great advantage, not only in defense but in offense. For a ship

    reliable. Numerous mock attacks were made and the crews became accustomed to the
    new technique. I was on one of the test flights and can vividly remember my impressions

    surface of an expanding bubble: in an instant they had vanished completely. So
    had the stars—but presently we could see that the Galaxy was still visible as
    a faint band of light around the ship. The virtual radius of our pseudo-space
    was not really infinite, but some hundred thousand light-years, and so the distance
    to the farthest stars of our system had not been greatly increased—though the
    nearest had of course totally disappeared. These training maneuvers, however,
    had to be canceled before they were completed, owing to a whole flock of minor
    technical troubles in various pieces of equipment, notably the communications

    Switching the Field on and off was equivalent to an elongation and contraction
    of the ship carrying the generator, but there was a hysteretic effect, as it were,
    and the initial condition was never quite reproducible, owing to all the thousands
    of electrical changes and movements of mass aboard the ship while the Field was
    on. These asymmetries and distortions were cumulative, and though they seldom
    amounted to more than a fraction of one per cent, that was quite enough. It meant
    that the precision ranging equipment and the tuned circuits in the communication
    apparatus were thrown completely out of adjustment. Any single ship could never
    detect the change—only when it compared its equipment with that of another vessel,
    or tried to communicate with it, could it tell what had happened.

    enemy ships were already attacking in thousands with weapons which now seemed
    centuries behind those that we had invented. Our magnificent Fleet, crippled by
    our own science, fought on as best it could until it was overwhelmed and forced
    to surrender. The ships fitted with the Field were still invulnerable, but as
    fighting units they were almost helpless. Every time they switched on their generators
