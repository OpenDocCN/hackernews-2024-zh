- en: The FBI spends "every day, all day long" interrogating people over their Facebook
    posts. At least, that's what agents told Stillwater, Oklahoma, resident Rolla
    Abdeljawad when they showed up at her house to ask her about her social media
    activity.

- en: Three FBI agents came to Abdeljawad's house and said that they had been given
    "screenshots" of her posts by Facebook. Her lawyer Hassan Shibly [posted a video](https://twitter.com/HassanShibly/status/1773160636983496706)
    of the incident online on Wednesday.

    badges on camera, which the agents refused to do. She [wrote on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/rollabd/posts/pfbid02qFjGQtUji99XgjcSJcyHf3Zp79KQwrtH5EUg5wwrsbfYEZovZ4J7aoFSu55UqUFAl)
    that she later confirmed with local police that the FBI agents really were FBI
    agents.

    a second agent in a red shirt added. "We do this every day, all day long. It''s

    and that it was the first time he had heard of Facebook's parent company, Meta,
    preemptively reporting posts to law enforcement. Andy Stone, a spokesman for Meta,
    and Kayla McCleery, a spokeswoman for the FBI's Oklahoma City office, declined
    to comment.*

    in response to a court order, a subpoena, a search warrant, or an emergency situation
    involving "imminent harm to a child or risk of death or serious physical injury
    to any person." The company received 73,956 requests from U.S. law enforcement
    and handed over data 87.84 percent of the time in the first half of 2023, according
    to the [Meta website](https://transparency.fb.com/reports/government-data-requests/country/US/).

    it themselves. For the past week, she has made multiple angry posts per day about
    the war in Gaza, referring to Israel as "Israhell." But none of the posts on her
    feed call for violence.

    monitoring she was later subjected to.

    at the Council on American-Islamic Relations, where Shibly used to be a state-level
    director. "It's unfortunately normal behavior for the FBI to target the community
    like this," Shibly says.

    of the video, Shibly added some advice to others: Abdeljawad was right to refuse
    to speak and right to record the interaction, but should not have stepped outside
    the house to talk to the FBI agents.'

    they''re going to be hearing directly from us. We''re going to deal with it. We''re
