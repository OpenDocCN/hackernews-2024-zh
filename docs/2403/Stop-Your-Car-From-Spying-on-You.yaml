    issue](https://reason.com/2024/02/15/big-brother-in-the-drivers-seat/) that our
    modern high-tech cars are tracking us and sharing data with manufacturers, cops,
    and parties unknown, came a report of soaring auto insurance premiums because
    of snitching vehicles. The consequences get worse from there. Fortunately, there
    are ways to keep your snoopy ride from contacting the mothership.

    disclosure report after his car insurance premium jumped by 21 percent. LexisNexis
    turned over documents containing "the dates of 640 trips, their start and end
    times, the distance driven and an accounting of any speeding, hard braking or
    sharp accelerations." The data came from General Motors based on his enrollment
    in OnStar Smart Driver. The records were interpreted as grounds for putting him
    in a higher insurance risk category.

    consequences. But other drivers are sometimes enrolled without their knowledge
    when they sign paperwork at the dealership. Worse, data may be collected through

    in a September 2023 [report](https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/privacynotincluded/articles/its-official-cars-are-the-worst-product-category-we-have-ever-reviewed-for-privacy/).
    Those features can be convenient, the authors noted, but "whenever you interact
    with your car you create a tiny record of what you just did. Like when you turn
    the steering wheel or unlock the doors. And usually all that information is collected
    and stored by the car company."

    No DCM, no interior microphone either, since that runs through the same fuse in
