    Turns out Ubuntu already runs sweet as pie as it’s based on the official [Raspberry

    is now able to force cold pages out to real swap if memory pressure gets too much
    (with opt-out for those who don’t wish to use this). There’s also a **new zswap
    mode to disable writing back to swap entirely**.

    (excepting Btrfs for now). Devs say writing to mounted devices may lead to filesystem
    corruption and crashes. This feature is disabled by default but it’s reasoned
    most Linux distros will choose to enable it.

- en: As for getting Linux 6.8, you can download the source code right now to compile
    the kernel by hand. Bit much; you’re best off waiting for your Linux distribution
    to package Linux kernel 6.8 officially and push it out to you as a software update.

    6.8 by default (and this will be back ported to Ubuntu 22.04 LTS in the next HWE/
    Ubuntu 22.04.5 LTS).

    is not encouraged** (not least because they’re not signed so may fail to boot
    in certain situations, won’t get security updates, don’t contain certain patches,
    etc).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That said, some folks do install Canonical mainline kernel builds in Ubuntu
    (though some only temporarily for testing). If you can’t wait to get your mitts
    on Linux kernel 6.8 then those pre-packaged DEBs are *an* option but not an advised
    one – use ’em at your own risk!
