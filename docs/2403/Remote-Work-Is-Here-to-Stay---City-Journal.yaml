- en: The pandemic-driven rise of remote work has changed many companies’ views of
    the necessity of physical office spaces. Companies, especially within the tech
    sector, that once prided themselves on sprawling campuses found in 2020 that their
    workforces were just as productive Zooming in from home. The resulting shift to
    remote work seemed to herald a new era of work-life balance and operational flexibility.

  zh: 远程工作的普及受到了疫情推动的影响，改变了许多公司对实体办公空间必要性的看法。特别是在科技行业，曾经以庞大校园为傲的公司在2020年发现，他们的员工在家通过Zoom工作同样高效。由此带来的远程工作转变似乎预示着一种新的工作生活平衡和运营灵活性的时代。
- en: As the world has emerged from the pandemic, however, some companies that had
    embraced “remote-first” policies are bringing workers back into the office. The
    [return-to-office (RTO) trend](https://www.city-journal.org/article/is-remote-work-really-the-future),
    observed in [corporate announcements](https://www.spokesman.com/stories/2024/mar/05/ups-employees-return-to-office-five-days-a-week)
    and [leadership rhetoric](https://ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/mornings-on-1/2023/11/27/jpmorgan-chase-ceo-reinforces-commitment-to-new-york-city),
    seems at odds with developments in the real estate market, where office vacancy
    rates continue to climb, reaching all-time highs in some areas.

  zh: 然而，随着世界从疫情中走出来，一些曾经采用“远程优先”政策的公司正在将员工带回办公室。观察到的“返办公”趋势，在[公司公告](https://www.spokesman.com/stories/2024/mar/05/ups-employees-return-to-office-five-days-a-week)和[领导层言论](https://ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/mornings-on-1/2023/11/27/jpmorgan-chase-ceo-reinforces-commitment-to-new-york-city)中可见，与房地产市场的发展形势相抵触，办公空间的空置率在一些地区达到历史新高。
- en: The gap between stated corporate objectives and actual choices has several possible
    explanations, with implications for the future of cities and office space. On
    the one hand, high vacancy rates demonstrate that office-space demand has not
    rebounded and may indicate that a significant share of the workforce is committed
    to sustained remote work. On the other hand, [reporting](https://fortune.com/2023/05/05/openai-ceo-sam-altman-remote-work-mistake-return-to-office)
    and [new policies](https://tech.co/news/amazon-staff-outraged-return-office) make
    clear that at least some companies do not view fully remote work as sustainable;
    indeed, some corporate leaders insist that in-person work is essential for collaboration,
    culture-building, and perhaps signaling of stability. As labor-market power shifts
    from workers to CEOs after [the zero-interest-rate policy years](https://www.businessinsider.com/zirp-end-of-cushy-big-tech-job-perks-mass-layoffs-2024-2),
    will employers who prefer in-person norms gain the upper hand in the office wars,
    as suggested by [recent tech layoffs](https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/12/tech-layoffs-2023-list)

  zh: 公司表面上的目标与实际选择之间的差距可能有几种可能的解释，这对城市和办公空间的未来具有重要影响。一方面，高空置率表明办公空间需求未能反弹，可能表明有相当一部分劳动力扎根于持续的远程工作之中。另一方面，[报道](https://fortune.com/2023/05/05/openai-ceo-sam-altman-remote-work-mistake-return-to-office)和[新政策](https://tech.co/news/amazon-staff-outraged-return-office)清楚地表明，至少有一些公司认为全面远程工作不可持续；事实上，一些企业领导坚持认为面对面工作对于协作、文化建设甚至稳定的信号至关重要。随着劳动市场力量从工人转向CEO，是否像Getaround和DocuSign等公司在[零利率政策年](https://www.businessinsider.com/zirp-end-of-cushy-big-tech-job-perks-mass-layoffs-2024-2)后的最新技术裁员所示，更偏好面对面规范的雇主将在办公室竞争中占上风？
- en: Two recent studies on remote work offer possible answers. [A study](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4675401)
    by University of Pittsburgh researchers finds that while firms often explore RTO
    when corporate performance lags, they do not see improved performance upon returning
    to in-person work; some CEOs may be using remote work as a scapegoat for poor
    corporate performance. [Another survey](https://cepr.org/voxeu/columns/managers-say-working-home-here-stay),
    involving remote-work guru Nick Bloom, investigated over 2,000 U.K. firms’ forecasts
    and found that managers generally expect the proportion of remote workers to be
    about the same in five years as it is today.

  zh: 两项关于远程工作的最新研究提供了可能的答案。[一项研究](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4675401)，由匹兹堡大学的研究人员进行，发现虽然在企业绩效不佳时公司经常探索回办公室工作，但在恢复到面对面工作后并未看到绩效改善；一些首席执行官可能将远程工作作为企业绩效不佳的替罪羊。[另一项调查](https://cepr.org/voxeu/columns/managers-say-working-home-here-stay)，由远程工作专家尼克·布鲁姆进行，调查了超过2000家英国公司的预测结果，发现管理人员普遍预计未来五年远程工作者的比例将与今天大致相同。
- en: Beyond those studies, two other factors imply the possible endurance of remote
    work. First, new firms are increasingly electing to operate remotely. Second,
    workers overall, including contractors and freelancers, often prefer fully remote
    work. While managers in Bloom’s survey expected a high degree of hybrid work (workers
    coming into the office a few days each week), the latest [Current Population Survey](https://www.bls.gov/cps/telework.htm)
    data found that about half of people who report working from home are doing so
    fully remotely.

  zh: 除了这些研究外，还有两个因素暗示了远程工作的可能持久性。首先，新公司越来越倾向于远程运营。其次，包括承包商和自由职业者在内的工作者普遍更喜欢完全远程工作。虽然布鲁姆调查中的管理人员预期高度混合工作（每周几天员工进入办公室），但最新的[当前人口统计调查](https://www.bls.gov/cps/telework.htm)数据显示，约有一半在家工作的人全职远程工作。
- en: The tension between high office-vacancy rates and employers’ anecdotal pullback
    from a fully remote workforce reflects firms and employees’ reevaluation of modern
    work—not just about where it is done, but how it is done most effectively. Firms
    have generally become more flexible since the pandemic; while some enacted RTO
    policies, others have embraced hybrid approaches, and still others have retained
    or even expanded remote-friendly options. Some workers also are quitting their
    current jobs for positions that offers fully remote options. In the long-term,
    firms offering such flexibility will likely expand employment and entrepreneurial
    prospects.

  zh: 高空置率与雇主从完全远程工作中撤退的轶事之间的紧张关系反映了公司和员工对现代工作的重新评估，这不仅涉及工作的地点，还涉及如何最有效地完成工作。自疫情爆发以来，公司普遍变得更加灵活；有些公司实施了回办公政策，而其他一些则采纳了混合办公的方式，还有些公司则保留甚至扩展了远程友好型的选择。一些员工也因为能提供完全远程工作的职位而辞去了现有工作。从长远来看，提供这种灵活性的公司很可能会扩大就业和创业机会。
- en: Despite the mixed signals and the evolving narratives, therefore, evidence points
    to the reality that remote work, in some form, is here to stay. The high office-vacancy
    rates are a concrete reminder of the pandemic’s lasting impact on work habits
    and preferences. At the same time, the move toward “remote-friendly” policies
    reflects many firms and employees’ understanding that the future of work is not
    binary but hybrid, blending the benefits of remote work with the undeniable value
    of in-person interactions. As companies and employees navigate this landscape,
    the challenge will be to find the right balance that maximizes productivity, innovation,
    and well-being—both for firms and the cities that previously relied on their presence.

  zh: 因此，尽管信号混杂且叙述不断发展，证据表明远程工作在某种形式上已经扎根。高空置率是疫情对工作习惯和偏好的持久影响的一个具体提示。与此同时，“远程友好型”政策的推动反映了许多公司和员工对工作未来的理解，即工作的未来不是二元对立的，而是混合的，融合了远程工作的好处与面对面互动的不可否认的价值。在公司和员工共同探索这一格局的过程中，挑战在于找到适当的平衡，最大化生产力、创新和福祉，无论是对公司还是依赖其存在的城市而言。
