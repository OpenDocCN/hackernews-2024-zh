- en: The pandemic-driven rise of remote work has changed many companies’ views of
    the necessity of physical office spaces. Companies, especially within the tech
    sector, that once prided themselves on sprawling campuses found in 2020 that their
    workforces were just as productive Zooming in from home. The resulting shift to
    remote work seemed to herald a new era of work-life balance and operational flexibility.

- en: As the world has emerged from the pandemic, however, some companies that had
    embraced “remote-first” policies are bringing workers back into the office. The
    [return-to-office (RTO) trend](https://www.city-journal.org/article/is-remote-work-really-the-future),
    observed in [corporate announcements](https://www.spokesman.com/stories/2024/mar/05/ups-employees-return-to-office-five-days-a-week)
    and [leadership rhetoric](https://ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/mornings-on-1/2023/11/27/jpmorgan-chase-ceo-reinforces-commitment-to-new-york-city),
    seems at odds with developments in the real estate market, where office vacancy
    rates continue to climb, reaching all-time highs in some areas.

- en: The gap between stated corporate objectives and actual choices has several possible
    explanations, with implications for the future of cities and office space. On
    the one hand, high vacancy rates demonstrate that office-space demand has not
    rebounded and may indicate that a significant share of the workforce is committed
    to sustained remote work. On the other hand, [reporting](https://fortune.com/2023/05/05/openai-ceo-sam-altman-remote-work-mistake-return-to-office)
    and [new policies](https://tech.co/news/amazon-staff-outraged-return-office) make
    clear that at least some companies do not view fully remote work as sustainable;
    indeed, some corporate leaders insist that in-person work is essential for collaboration,
    culture-building, and perhaps signaling of stability. As labor-market power shifts
    from workers to CEOs after [the zero-interest-rate policy years](https://www.businessinsider.com/zirp-end-of-cushy-big-tech-job-perks-mass-layoffs-2024-2),
    will employers who prefer in-person norms gain the upper hand in the office wars,
    as suggested by [recent tech layoffs](https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/12/tech-layoffs-2023-list)
    at firms like Getaround and DocuSign?

- en: Two recent studies on remote work offer possible answers. [A study](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4675401)
    by University of Pittsburgh researchers finds that while firms often explore RTO
    when corporate performance lags, they do not see improved performance upon returning
    to in-person work; some CEOs may be using remote work as a scapegoat for poor
    corporate performance. [Another survey](https://cepr.org/voxeu/columns/managers-say-working-home-here-stay),
    involving remote-work guru Nick Bloom, investigated over 2,000 U.K. firms’ forecasts
    and found that managers generally expect the proportion of remote workers to be
    about the same in five years as it is today.

- en: Beyond those studies, two other factors imply the possible endurance of remote
    work. First, new firms are increasingly electing to operate remotely. Second,
    workers overall, including contractors and freelancers, often prefer fully remote
    work. While managers in Bloom’s survey expected a high degree of hybrid work (workers
    coming into the office a few days each week), the latest [Current Population Survey](https://www.bls.gov/cps/telework.htm)
    data found that about half of people who report working from home are doing so
    fully remotely.

- en: The tension between high office-vacancy rates and employers’ anecdotal pullback
    from a fully remote workforce reflects firms and employees’ reevaluation of modern
    work—not just about where it is done, but how it is done most effectively. Firms
    have generally become more flexible since the pandemic; while some enacted RTO
    policies, others have embraced hybrid approaches, and still others have retained
    or even expanded remote-friendly options. Some workers also are quitting their
    current jobs for positions that offers fully remote options. In the long-term,
    firms offering such flexibility will likely expand employment and entrepreneurial
    prospects.

- en: Despite the mixed signals and the evolving narratives, therefore, evidence points
    to the reality that remote work, in some form, is here to stay. The high office-vacancy
    rates are a concrete reminder of the pandemic’s lasting impact on work habits
    and preferences. At the same time, the move toward “remote-friendly” policies
    reflects many firms and employees’ understanding that the future of work is not
    binary but hybrid, blending the benefits of remote work with the undeniable value
    of in-person interactions. As companies and employees navigate this landscape,
    the challenge will be to find the right balance that maximizes productivity, innovation,
    and well-being—both for firms and the cities that previously relied on their presence.
