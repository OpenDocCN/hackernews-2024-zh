- en: Stephen Scherr, who ran Hertz for just over two years after three decades at
    [Goldman Sachs](https://fortune.com/company/goldman-sachs-group/) Group Inc.,
    has decided to step down, the rental-car company said late Friday in a statement.
    It’s replacing him with Gil West, the former chief operating officer of [General
    Motors](https://fortune.com/company/general-motors/) Co.’s Cruise robotaxi unit.
    West also will join the board of directors on April 1, according to the statement,
    which confirmed an earlier Bloomberg report.

    started making splashy wagers on electric vehicles. Under new owners Knighthead
    Capital Management and Certares Management, the rental company announced plans
    to order 100,000 vehicles from [Tesla](https://fortune.com/company/tesla/) Inc.,
    sending the automaker’s market capitalization soaring past the [$1 trillion](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-25/hertz-said-to-order-100-000-teslas-in-car-rental-market-shake-up) mark

    Greg O’Hara at Certares had identified West as a CEO candidate and approached
    him about leaving Cruise, according to two people with knowledge of those discussions
    who asked not to be identified. But GM, which had big plans for robotaxis at the
    time, didn’t want to let West go. So the investors installed Mark Fields, who’d
    run [Ford Motor](https://fortune.com/company/ford-motor/) Co., as Hertz’s interim
    CEO and conducted a full CEO search, settling on Scherr in February 2022.
