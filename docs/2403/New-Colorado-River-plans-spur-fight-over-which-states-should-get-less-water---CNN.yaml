    gallons of water out of the river basin in just the last two decades alone – a
    volume about the size of Lake Mead itself.

    reservoirs across the upper and lower basins, including the Flaming Gorge Reservoir
    and lakes Havasu and Mohave, in addition to Mead and Powell, to determine when
    cuts would be necessary.

    basin plan has California, Arizona and Nevada taking the brunt of cuts. If, however,
    water levels across the system were to drop below 38%, the lower basin plan would
    spread cuts ranging between 1.5 million to 3.9 million acre-feet across all seven
    states, plus the country of Mexico – which also uses river water.

    shouldn’t give upper basin states an out from sharing in future reductions.
