- en: One of the most common spy movie tropes is the protagonist's ability to tag
    a suspect with a discreet tracking dart from afar. That way, they can covertly
    track the baddies wherever they go. Well, it's no longer a spy movie trick—it's
    reality, as police departments have begun tagging [fleeing vehicles](https://www.thedrive.com/news/this-high-speed-chase-of-a-u-haul-gmc-savana-is-pure-chaos)
    with GPS trackers, eliminating the need for high-speed pursuit.

- en: Old Westbury Police Department in New York is using vehicle-mounted launchers
    that fire foam projectiles with a heat-activated sticky glue at fleeing vehicles
    in a car chase. The projectiles have wireless GPS tracking systems built into
    them, which allow police to track the car's whereabouts. The launchers and darts
    are made by [StarChase](https://www.starchase.com/products/vehicle-mounted-gps-launcher/),
    who also leases out handheld units to the NYPD, among other departments. The idea
    is to eliminate car chases, which are dangerous and often put the public at risk.

    Stuart Cameron, according to [*Gothamist*](https://gothamist.com/news/traffic-jams-airtags-and-gps-darts-are-all-ways-ny-nj-police-are-trying-to-stop-car-theft).
    “The statistics just speak for themselves ... suspects are getting hurt, officers
    are getting hurt, and even members of the public are getting killed and injured
    in these pursuits.”

    need for. *AP News via YouTube*

    a fleeing vehicle for long enough to tag it with a sticky dart, and then they
    can back off and track its location. Compressed air fires the darts, and they're
    said to travel at about 30 mph and stick without leaving any damage.

- en: It isn't only on Long Island where these tracking darts are used, though. Police
    departments in Michigan, Tennessee, Texas, Washington State, and more have begun
    fitting them. However, the usage of these trackers on civilian vehicles raises
    questions about their constitutionality, as some have argued that they violate
    Fourth Amendment rights. In a 2012 Supreme Court case, *U.S. vs Jones*, it was
    unanimously ruled that GPS tracking a car without a warrant constitutes an illegal
    search, breaching the Fourth Amendment. However, the American Civil Liberties
    Union (ACLU) has stated that there isn't an issue with GPS tracking darts, "assuming
    that [they're] used in the kind of way that everybody probably imagines," in the
    words of [Jay Stanley, ACLU senior policy analyst](https://www.aclu.org/news/national-security/gps-bullets-allow-police-shoot-tracker-car).
    Put another way, if the dart's fired during a car chase with a fleeing vehicle,
    its use is likely legal so long as the tracker is then removed after the vehicle's
    been caught.

- en: GPS tracking darts aren't all that new, but they're becoming more widespread
    among law enforcement. On one hand, it strikes a little dystopian that police
    are getting in the habit of tracking vehicles this way, but on the other, when
    used properly, they have the potential to spare everyone a dangerous crash.
