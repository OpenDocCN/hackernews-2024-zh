The Justice Department is looking into the Jan. 5 blowout of a portion of the fuselage of a Boeing 737 Max jetliner operated by Alaska Airlines, according to two people briefed on the matter.

Federal prosecutors have interviewed several witnesses in connection with the criminal investigation, including the pilots and aircrew of the Alaska flight, according to two individuals who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they are not authorized to speak publicly about the probe. A grand jury has been convened to examine evidence, one person said.
