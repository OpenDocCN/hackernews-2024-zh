- en: The DOJ, along with 16 state and district attorneys general, accuses Apple of
    driving up prices for consumers and developers at the expense of making users
    more reliant on its phones. The parties allege that Apple “selectively” imposes
    contractual restrictions on developers and withholds critical ways of accessing
    the phone as a way to prevent competition from arising, according to the release.

    cloud streaming apps,” prevent it from “using private APIs to undermine crossplatform
    technologies like messaging, smartwatches, and digital wallets,” and keep it from

    General Lisa Monaco [said](/2024/3/21/24107724/apple-has-maintained-a-chokehold-on-competition-deputy-ag-says)
    Apple has maintained “a chokehold on competition” and “smothered an entire industry”
    through its shift from “revolutionizing the smartphone market to stalling its
    advancement.” Kanter added that Apple was a “significant beneficiary” of the DOJ’s
    suit against Microsoft over 20 years ago, and this case aims “to protect competition
    and innovation for the next generation of technology.”

    Apple spokesperson Fred Sainz said the lawsuit “threatens who we are and the principles
    that set Apple products apart in fiercely competitive markets. If successful,
    it would hinder our ability to create the kind of technology people expect from
    Apple — where hardware, software, and services intersect. It would also set a
    dangerous precedent, empowering government to take a heavy hand in designing people’s
    technology. We believe this lawsuit is wrong on the facts and the law, and we
    will vigorously defend against it.”'

    two separate antitrust suits against Google over the past two administrations.
    It’s reversed a long drought of tech monopolization cases since the landmark Microsoft
    lawsuit at the turn of the century. The case has been years in the making, with

- en: App developers for Apple’s iOS have complained for years about the platform’s
    closed and often opaque marketplace. Among the most vocal have been companies
    [like Spotify](/2022/10/25/23423384/spotify-apple-competitive-behavior-antitrust-commission-audiobooks),
    which run paid subscription services that Apple requires a 15 to 30 percent cut
    of to be offered on its platform. On top of that, Apple has its own apps that
    compete with those on its app store — the only place Apple lets users download
    apps for what it says are security reasons — which has raised even more distrust
    among developers about whether they are getting a fair shot in the marketplace.
