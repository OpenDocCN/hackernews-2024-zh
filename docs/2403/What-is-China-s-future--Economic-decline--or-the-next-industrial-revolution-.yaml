    that this state sector is, in a sense, an impediment to growth. And we've seen
    a resurrection of this idea, *guo jin min tui* (国进民退), which is used to refer
    to the idea that the state sector is advancing and the private sector is retreating.

    - these ideas were invented by neoliberal economists in 2002 - the private sector
    is equated with the people, which I find absolutely astonishing. But, I mean,
    the country does have a very significant public sector.

    it that these Western economists seem to think China should do? And they seem
    to think that China should privatize all assets into the hands of domestic and
    foreign capitalists. It should remove capital controls. It should open the door
    to foreign finance capital. It should transfer governance to liberal capitalist
    political parties that are actually controlled by capital.
  id: totrans-split-38

    that it's the state that controls capital, rather than capital that controls the
    state. And it's, in fact, this aspect of the Chinese model, and in particular,
    the rule of the Communist Party of China that has basically transformed China
    from what was, effectively one of the poorest countries in the world into one
    of its largest industrial powers.

    Eastern European countries when they were still ruled by communist parties. We
    generally refer to them as socialist or communist, but in reality, they themselves
    never claimed to be socialist or communist. They only said they were building
    socialism, especially in a country that was as poor as China was in 1949.

    has to be a long period of transition in which there will be a complex set of

    of socialism, in order to build socialism.
  id: totrans-split-51

    state and a multi-party state. People don't realize very often that while the

    character of China.

    those capitalists are very powerful. They are at the head of some of the biggest
    corporations in the world, and they are quite influential within the Communist
    Party. But what makes China meaningfully socialist or meaningfully treading the
    path to socialism, let's put it that way, is the fact that ultimately the reins
    of power are held in the hands of the Communist Party of China leadership, which
    owes its legitimacy to the people of China.
  id: totrans-split-54

- en: So, in that sense, I would say that China is meaningfully socialist. Although,
    as Mick pointed out, there is a fairly large private sector in China, but so too
    is the state sector very large. And the extent of state ownership means that even
    though the private sector is very large, the state retains control over the overall
    pace and pattern of growth and development in the country.
  id: totrans-split-56
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And I just add one final thing here, which is going to become quite important
    as we discuss the various other points, and that is that the financial sector
    in China remains very heavily controlled by the state.
  id: totrans-split-57
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: China has capital controls, China practices a fair degree of financial repression,
    and China's financial system is geared to providing money for long-term investments
    that improve the productive capacities of the economy and the material welfare
    of the people. And this is completely different from the kind of financial sector
    we have today.

    strategic targets that relate to raising the quality of the life of all the Chinese
    people. And it has strategic autonomy, which gives China the opportunity or the
    possibility of actually choosing its own development path.'

    they going to finance their investment? If they let foreign banks come in to finance
    their investment, if they let American and European banks come in, what do they

    They fund takeover loans. They fund privatization.
  id: totrans-split-64

    new tangible investment. Banks make money so you can buy a public utility or a
    railroad and then just load it down with debt, and you can borrow and borrow and
    use the money that you borrow to pay a special dividend if you're a private capital
    company. Pretty soon, the country that follows this dependency on foreign credit
    ends up losing its sovereignty.
  id: totrans-split-65
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    public domain and to create money for actual tangible capital investment, not

    Chinese economy and the Chinese state. At the end of the day, it's not just important
    to say that the state controls the economy, but whose state is it?
  id: totrans-split-68
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The way to look at it as well is that in the United States, essentially we have
    a state that is controlled by the big corporations, which in our time have become
    exceedingly financialized corporations, so that they are directing the United
    States economy essentially towards ever more debt and ever less production, whereas
    that is not the case in China.
  id: totrans-split-69

    capacity.

    about them.

    fundamentally misrepresenting the character of the Chinese system and the way
    in which it works, because they, in a sense, merely equate democracy with a system,
    whereas China, of course, does have multiple political parties, but a system with
    competitive elections between different political parties. There are other models
    of democracy, and China is another model of democracy.

    democracy. Indeed, in China, they have recently developed a new term for it. They
    call it a "whole process democracy", and it really involves multiple levels of
    consultation with the people, going down to the most basic village and township
    levels, and then all the way up the chain.'
  id: totrans-split-74

    the CPC leadership is its ability to change direction pragmatically. If something

    quite aware, as Mick pointed out, the whole thing has begun by, this whole property
    bubble is in good part a product of the fact that when relations between China
    and the West were much better, China accepted some World Bank advice, and this
    is partly a result of that and the kind of deregulation that the World Bank had
    suggested.

    accept such bad advice again, even if they were good. And now that they're not
    good, there will be, and China is clearly looking at distinctively pragmatic,
    socialistic ways out.

    housing has become a major priority, not building houses for private ownership,
    but rather building houses which will be kept in the public sector and rented

    the way to go.
  id: totrans-split-207

    bubble in the United States were bound to have very different consequences, partly
    because, well, for two reasons, mainly. Number one, the nature of their financial
    systems were very different.
  id: totrans-split-208

    resembles China's financial system to something that resembles much more the US

    its economy capitalist. So in many ways is the United States.
  id: totrans-split-209
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    of the Plaza Accord was that, by the time the Plaza Accord came around, Japan
    was no longer interested in buying US treasuries. And as a result, the United
    States essentially restricted its access to US markets in a much bigger way. And
    so, essentially, Japan lost those export markets.

    a very, very strong, steady increase in the share of loans going to industrial

    areas, like private tutoring, which was generating large disparities in the educational

    Michael raised really concerns how in future will local government be funded,
    and will there be a reform in the system of taxation?

- en: Will a property tax be introduced in order to generate government revenue rather
    than relying upon this land tax? Because of course that did encourage local government
    to allocate that land to people who are going to build housing for upper-income
    groups, because the implications for land value were under that situation, they
    would actually be higher rather than providing that land to construct housing
    for low income groups.

    someone who's an expert in public finance.

    show, the first part of this show to an end. And let me just do that by going
    back to our list of topics.'

    of Japanification and the alleged property bubble will resonate into all the rest
    of the topics, certainly the question of consumption, exports and China's new
    growth strategy. So we will return to it.

    topics, restricted consumption, exports, new growth strategy, and of course, China's
    foreign economic policy.
