- en: More than thirty years ago, I was the first visiting professor at the College
    de France in Paris, with an office in the laboratory of experimental physics.
    I noticed that my experimental colleagues were frequently drawing little pictures
    in their notebooks, which I assumed were diagrams of experimental apparatus. But
    it turned out that those drawings were mostly of a gallows for hanging the vice
    director of the lab, whose rigid ideas drove them crazy.

    one of which was Project Ozma, the attempt to detect signals from another technical
    civilization on a planet of a nearby star. SETI, the Search for Extraterrestrial
    Intelligence, is the present-day successor of that project. “How could you communicate
    if you found such a civilization?” he asked, assuming both interlocutors would
    have the patience to wait for the signals to be transmitted back and forth. I
    suggested that we might try beep, beep-beep, beep-beep-beep, for 1, 2, 3, and
    so forth, and then perhaps 1, 2, 3 . . ., 92 for the stable (except 41 and 63)
    chemical elements, etc., etc. “Wait,” said the *sous-directeur*, “that is absurd.
    The number 92 would mean nothing to them . . . why, if they have 92 chemical elements,
    then they must also have the Eiffel Tower and Brigitte Bardot.”

    of neo-Kantian philosophy, in which the laws of nature are nothing but Kantian
    “categories” used by the *human mind* to grasp reality. (Many also taught, by
    the way, that artistic criticism is absolute and not a matter of taste, while
    the opinion that artistic standards are relative was treated as a feature of Anglo-Saxon
    pragmatism.)

    circles in France (and elsewhere). That is the idea that the structures and objects
    of mathematics—say, Lie groups—have a reality, that they exist, in a sense, somewhere
    beyond space and time. (It is easy to see how one can come to think that way.
    Start with the positive integers—they certainly exist, in the sense of being used
    to count things. Number theory—okay. Zero and negative numbers—why not? Fractions,
    square roots? Solutions of algebraic equations in complex numbers? Probably—one
    is on a slippery slope.) These two points of view are argued in a book, *Mati*è*re*
    à *Pens*é*e*, published recently by the biologist Jean-Pierre Changeux and the
    mathematician Alain Connes. I shall not inflict all their philosophical arguments
    on this congenial group, and anyway I have never studied them carefully. Let me
    say merely that the authors do raise the question of what is the role of mathematical
    theory in our understanding of the world, especially the physical world.

    Mathematics in the Natural Sciences.” I don’t know what he wrote in the article,
    but it is certainly a fact that, up to now, especially in the domain of fundamental
    physics, we have had striking success with our use of mathematics.

    trick and the mathematicians later formalize and adapt it. Sometimes, as with
    Heisenberg and matrices, the concept is already known to mathematicians and physicists
    but not to the particular theoretician involved; he reinvents it. Often, as with
    Einstein, the physicist senses what he wants and asks a mathematician to provide
    it—in the case of the equation describing general relativistic gravitation, Einstein
    asked his old classmate, Marcel Grossmann, for the tensor he needed, and thus
    the Ricci tensor became the Ricci–Einstein tensor.

    so seemingly abstruse that it appeared to have left physics far behind, so that,
    among all the new structures being explored by mathematicians, the fraction that
    would even be of any interest to science would be so small as not to make it worth
    the time of a scientist to study them.

- en: But all that has changed in the last decade or two. It has turned out that the
    apparent divergence of pure mathematics from science was partly an illusion produced
    by the obscurantist, ultrarigorous language used by mathematicians, especially
    those of a Bourbakian persuasion, and by their reluctance to write up nontrivial
    examples in explicit detail. When demystified, large chunks of modern mathematics
    turn out to be connected with physics and other sciences, and these chunks are
    mostly in or near the most prestigious parts of mathematics, such as differential
    topology, where geometry, analysis, and algebra come together. Pure mathematics
    and science are finally being reunited and, mercifully, the Bourbaki plague is
    dying out. (In the late Soviet Union, they never succumbed to it in the first
    place.)

    for Advanced Study in Princeton, Frank Yang was discussing with other physicists
    the recently developed Yang–Mills quantum field theory. At the same time, S. S.
    Chern was lecturing on pure mathematics. Not only did Frank attend some of the
    lectures, but he and Chern were old friends, their children played together, and
    Chern had been one of Frank’s teachers in China; neither of them noticed that
    Chern’s lectures on fiber bundles were basically concerned with the same subject
    as Frank’s lectures on Yang–Mills theory! In fact, they didn’t learn about this
    equivalence for many years.

- en: Yang–Mills theory, from the physics point of view, was a generalization of quantum
    electrodynamics from the gauge group U1 to the gauge group SU2 with noncommuting
    charges. Later, we generalized it to all products of U1 factors and simple compact
    Lie groups, including SU3\. Today the “standard model” of elementary particle
    physics, apart from gravitation, is based on SU3 x SU2 x U1\. Moreover, Einsteinian
    gravitation has strong parallels with generalized Yang–Mills theory, although
    the gravitation theory is based on the noncompact Lorentz group and involves a
    tensor instead of a vector field. What does it mean that this progression from
    one gauge group to another has worked so well? Are we really dealing with something
    peculiar to the human mind or with a phenomenon so deeply rooted in the properties
    of nature that any advanced complex adaptive system would be likely to follow
    similar paths?

    by Isaac Newton. Children learn that he thought of the theory of universal gravitation
    when an apple fell on his head. Well, not on his head, but nearby, anyway.

- en: Historians of science are not sure whether to credit the apple at all, but they
    admit that there could have been an apple. As you know, in 1665 the University
    of Cambridge closed up on account of the plague and sent everyone home, including
    Newton, a fresh BA, who went back to Woolsthorpe, Lincolnshire. There, during
    1665 and 1666, he thought a little about integration and differentiation, a little
    more about the law of gravitation, and a lot about the laws of motion. Moreover,
    he carried out the experiment showing that white light is made up of the colors
    of the rainbow. While historians of science now emphasize that he didn’t completely
    clear up all these matters in one *annus mirabilis*, or “marvelous year,” they
    admit that he made a good start on all of them around this time. As my friend
    Marcia Southwick says, he could have written a pretty impressive essay on “What
    I Did During My Summer Vacation.”

    & whilst he was musing in a garden it came into his thought that the power of
    gravity (wch brought an apple from the tree to the ground) was not limited to
    a certain distance from the earth but that this power must extend much farther
    than was usually thought. Why not as high as the moon said he to himself & if
    so that must influence her motion & perhaps retain her in orbit, whereupon he
    fell a calculating what would be the effect of that supposition but being absent
    from books & taking the common estimate in use among Geographers & our seamen
    before Norwood had measured the Earth, that sixty English miles were contained
    in one degree of latitude on the surface of the Earth his computation did not
    agree with his theory & inclined him then to entertain a notion that together
    with the force of gravity there might be a mixture of that force wch the moon
    would have if it was carried along in a vortex . . . .

- en: Today some of us have the same concerns about extrapolation as the ones to which
    Newton refers—Shelly Glashow inveighs against superstring theory because, in embracing
    Einsteinian gravitation, along with the other forces, it achieves its synthesis
    around the Planck mass of 2 x 1019 GeV, larger by a gigantic factor than any energy
    at which particle physics experiments are carried out. But he and others were
    in the forefront of extrapolating the standard model SU3 x SU2 x U1 to a unified
    Yang–Mills theory based on SU5, in which the unification (without gravitation)
    is achieved around 1014 or 1015 GeV, which lies most of the way to the Planck
    mass. Moreover, Shelly and others have alleged that nothing much could happen
    in between present energies and 1014 GeV or so—there would just be a desert.

    they are often very rich in plant and animal life, so the gap between our experimental
    energies of a few hundred GeV and 1014 GeV may well contain some interesting flora
    and fauna, especially the supersymmetric partners of the known particles—as suggested
    by superstring theory. In fact, the unified super-Yang–Mills extrapolation works
    much better than the straight unified Yang–Mills theory (what some people call,
    quite inappropriately, in my opinion, “grand unified theory”).

    which the Attraction is perform’d. The Attractions of Gravity, Magnetism, and
    Electricity, reach to very sensible distances, and so have been observed by vulgar
    Eyes, and there may be others which reach to so small distances as hitherto escape
    Observation; and perhaps electrical Attraction may reach to such small distances,

    well as within each one, just the kind of idea that we have followed in going

- en: If we modernize Newton’s conception a bit, we could say that the laws of nature
    exhibit a certain amount of self-similarity and not, of course, perfect scaling,
    but rather the kind of thing one sees in the Mandelbrot fractal set. So, in peeling
    the skins off the onion of fundamental physics, we encounter certain similarities
    between one layer and the next. As a result, the mathematics with which we become
    familiar on account of its usefulness in describing one layer suggests new mathematics,
    some of which may apply at the next layer—in fact, even the old mathematics may
    still be useful at the next layer. These generalizations may be performed either
    by theoretical physicists or by mathematicians. If pure mathematicians are exploring
    ambitious generalizations of known mathematical structures, they will surely run
    across some of the new ones that are needed—along with much more besides.

- en: Ultimately, then, we can argue that it is the self-similarity of the structure
    of fundamental physical law that dictates the continuing usefulness of mathematics.
    Suppose that the fundamental theory of the elementary particles and their interactions
    is really heterotic superstring theory. It has a huge set of symmetries, including
    the conformal string symmetries that encompass the bootstrap principle and general
    relativity, and an internal symmetry group E8 x E8 that undergoes spontaneous
    symmetry breaking. The outer layers of the onion show gravitation and electromagnetism.
    Penetrating a little further turns up SU2 x Ul, SU3 of color, and the bootstrap
    idea. And so it goes on. The mathematics at each level is not usually identical
    with that at the next level, but it has a strong family relationship. The successive
    renormalizable approximate theories, by the way, represent autonomous shells that
    depend on what is inside only through the renormalized parameters.

- en: At the modest level of earlier science, this sort of self-similarity is strikingly
    apparent. Electricity, gravitation, and magnetism all have the same l/r2 force,
    and Newton, as we have seen, suggested that there might be some short-range forces
    as well. Perhaps in some lost manuscript he proposed the Yukawa potential! Now
    that scientists and mathematicians are paying attention to scaling phenomena,
    we see in the study of complex systems astonishing power laws extending over many
    orders of magnitude. Often the underlying mechanism is changing while the power
    law still holds, as for the cosmic ray energy spectrum, the advance of technologies
    over time, and so forth.

    theory, turns out to apply not only to critical phenomena in condensed matter
    but to numerous other far-flung subjects as well. The biological and social sciences
    are just as much involved in these discoveries of scaling behavior as the physical
    sciences. We are always dealing with Nature consonant and conformable to herself,
    not only within scaling behavior but also in the occurrence of similar phenomenological
    laws in a plethora of disparate areas. So the approximate self-similarity of the
    laws of nature runs the gamut from the simple underlying laws of fundamental physics
    to the phenomenological laws of the most complex phenomena. No wonder our mathematics
    keeps working so well in the sciences, when self-similarity is so widespread.

- en: Of course, there may be something important here about the nature of mathematics
    itself. In connection with that, let me close by paraphrasing some wonderful remarks
    made by that brilliant and modest theoretical physicist Feza Gürsey on the occasion
    of his receiving, at the University of Miami, not the valuable kind of prize he
    deserves but half of the $1,000 Oppenheimer Prize. He said, more or less, that
    he had achieved some success by pointing, often before other theorists, to mathematical
    structures that would be useful in the near future in elementary particle physics.
    But often he hadn’t had any clear idea of exactly how or why these mathematical
    methods would be used. He compared himself with Inspector Clouseau, bumbling along,
    bumping into walls, but somehow finally pointing to the right suspects. Why, he
    asked, did the Inspector Clouseau method work? Maybe, he suggested, because such
    mathematical structures are comparatively rare, so that it is possible to find
    and identify something like the exceptional group E8 as an object of interest
    simply because structures with its remarkable properties are not thick on the
    ground. Thus, it may be that the character of mathematics plays a role in our
    story, along with Nature consonant and conformable to herself.
