    the rate at which coffee cools. Unlike many of the other [Serious Eats reviews
    I’ve done](https://www.seriouseats.com/ashley-rodriguez-5185578), this review
    lent itself well to a control group: a mug of coffee simply left on the counter.
    During the temperature hold test, where I tested each mug’s ability to hold hot
    coffee (taking the temperature every 10 minutes over a 90-minute period), I also
    measured a regular ol’ cup of coffee to see how its temperature changed over time.'

    inside my home was, for example, and if that contributed to a slower or faster
    cooling rate. I used an amber mug made by the folks at [MANUAL](https://www.manual.is/),
    and I can’t say if these results would be the same if I tested in a porcelain
    or ceramic mug.) However, it seems like coffee loses about 40 degrees in the first
    10 minutes, 25 more degrees after 20 minutes, and so on (see above). The rate
    at which coffee loses heat is high when coffee is very hot, and then it slows
    down as it cools.
  prefs: []

- en: 'When I saw these results, I was even more convinced that a temperature-controlled
    mug could be a worthwhile investment since coffee loses so much heat so quickly.
    Anecdotally, I also know this to be true. The first few moments you’re waiting
    for coffee to cool can feel like an eternity, but the second coffee reaches an
    ideal temperature (more on this below), it’ll continue to lose heat. The moments
    between the perfect temperature and unpleasantly cool can be a phone call, a quick
    question from a colleague, or a bathroom break. This is all to say: Seeing a mug
    of coffee''s temperature drop from 136°F (after 10 minutes) to 111°F (after 20
    minutes) was enough to convince me that, for the right person, these temperature
    control mugs are a good way to solve a very common problem.'

    [We did a deep dive into how temperature affects flavor](https://www.seriouseats.com/why-room-temperature-food-is-often-better),

    that are too hot will mask flavor while items that are too cool will dull them.
    There’s no uniform understanding of the relationship between temperature and flavor
    (our article notes, for example, that “beer turns bitter when warmed from its
    typical serving temperature; coffee, on the other hand, has been found to taste
    less bitter when cooled down from piping-hot.”) but it does seem there’s a sweet
    spot between just above body temperature and just below our heat threshold (around
    150-160°F, but that’s also not a super scientific range and really depends on
    your own personal preferences).'

    guess they meant that drip coffee should be *served*, not necessarily consumed,
    between 180-185°F. Their website points to [a study that shows most people prefer
    their coffee at around 140°F](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/230106152_At_What_Temperatures_Do_Consumers_Like_to_Drink_Coffee_Mixing_Methods).

    of glass you smashed into a zillion pieces: it’s not going to come out the same.
    And yes, oxidation will occur with any coffee you simply let sit out, regardless

    in general can keep coffee hotter for longer, which I saw demonstrated in my testing.
    After the mug ran of out battery (which took about three hours) its tapered shape
    meant that coffee cooled at a much slower rate than any of its competitors. Also,
    because of this design, less coffee was exposed to oxygen, so it oxidized at a
    much slower rate. I found that most of the mugs tasted relatively the same after
    90 minutes, save the Ember Travel, which was superior to the others.'

    Ember Travel use the same app to control temperature, the Ember Travel displays
    temperature readings in real-time (the Ember mug just has a light on the bottom
    that flashes different colors, which were difficult to remember and interpret).
    When I initially poured coffee into the Ember Travel, it gave me a reading of
    the coffee’s current temperature. However, there was a threshold: when I poured
    cold water, the mug simply read “cold,” but it also flashed the word “empty” to
    indicate when there was no liquid.'

    to exactly the temperature you want (along with its app constantly disconnecting
    every time I entered a different room, the VSIToo only allows you to tweak the
    temperature in nine-degree increments). Overall, I’m not sure you can ask much

    be enjoyed at an office, while a regular mug with a handle can’t go on the road
    or fit into a car mug carrier. I think that’s more an issue of preference rather
    than a ding on the mug itself.

- en: Yes, but honestly? Not by a lot. Compared to a freshly brewed cup of coffee,
    the coffees I tasted two, three, and even four hours later were pretty pleasant,
    and I expected them to degrade much more than they did.

    double-walled insulated carafes with [coffee brewers](https://www.seriouseats.com/the-best-automatic-drip-coffee-makers).
    I like double-walled carafes because they keep coffee hot without baking or exposing
    the coffee to additional heat, and while these mugs do use heat to keep the coffee
    warm (they do so gently: it’s easier to keep something at a consistent temperature
    than to bring it up from room temperature or colder), I thought, “if I care so
    much about keeping coffee warm after it’s brewed, why am I not thinking about
    how to keep it warm after it’s poured?” I don’t think I would have ever considered
    buying a temperature control mug until I did that first taste test, and now I’m
    going to order one for myself.'

- en: Yes, many temperature control mugs (like the Ember) use an app. The app is where
    you'll be easily able to set and adjust the mug's temperature. Some mugs, though,
    only have on-board displays.
