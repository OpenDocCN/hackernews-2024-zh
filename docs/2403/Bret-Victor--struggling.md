# Bret Victor, struggling

> 来源：[https://worrydream.com/](https://worrydream.com/)

In 2013, I started the research lab that became Dynamicland. Most of my subsequent work will be found on the new [Dynamicland website](https://dynamicland.org/) once it goes public in the summer of 2024.

Promotional bio.

Bret Victor led the team that invented Realtalk and founded Dynamicland.

Previously at Apple, he designed the earliest user interface concepts for the iPad and several other new hardware platforms. His work established Apple’s internal future-interfaces prototyping group, whose inventions have shipped in billions of Apple products.

His later public-domain work on next-generation programming interfaces has been viewed millions of times, and directly inspired numerous products, companies, and academic papers.

His work has won the Apple Design Award twice. Computing pioneer Alan Kay has called him “one of the greatest user interface design minds in the world today”, and design legend Edward Tufte recognized him as a “design theory wizard, at the cutting edge of interface designs for programming, seeing, reasoning”.

He has electrical engineering degrees from Caltech and UC Berkeley.
