Join us in Boston for Startup School East on April 20!

### STARTUP SCHOOL EAST:

On April 20, we’re hosting Startup School East, a one-day event where you’ll hear stories and advice from founders and YC partners.

Hear how some of the most successful people in Silicon Valley got started, the mistakes they made along the way, and what they wish they’d known at 22\.

All of YC’s partners are flying in for this one — so if you’ve been looking for an opportunity to meet them, this is it.

**>** [**Apply to attend Startup School East by April 12**](https://events.ycombinator.com/suseast24)**.**

We’ll be chartering buses to travel to and from schools around the Northeast. Sign up early if you’d like a seat on one of the buses.
