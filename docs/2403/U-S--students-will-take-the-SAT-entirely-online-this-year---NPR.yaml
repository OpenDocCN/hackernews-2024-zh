    — including a tablet or a laptop — or on school devices. The test is also one
    hour shorter (down from three hours), has shorter reading passages and uses digital
    tools, like a highlighter, a graphing calculator and a bookmark to go back to
    skipped questions.

    by the College Board. Schools were given time ahead of testing dates to download
    the app onto their devices. Internet access is key to start the test, though Rodriquez
    says it requires very little bandwidth during the test and is designed to autosave
    locally, so students won't lose work or time if they lose their internet connection.

    exam, is being called into question in the college admissions process. [More than
    1,800 U.S. colleges](https://fairtest.org/overwhelming-majority-of-u-s-colleges-and-universities-remain-act-sat-optional-or-test-blind-score-free-for-fall-2025/)
    are not requiring a test score for students applying to enroll in fall 2025, according
    to the National Center for Fair & Open Testing. But in recent weeks, some elite
    private colleges, including [Brown University](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-03-05/brown-university-becomes-third-ivy-to-reinstate-sat-requirements?embedded-checkout=true)
    and [Dartmouth College](https://www.npr.org/2024/02/05/1229223433/sat-act-diversity-dartmouth-college-admissions),
    have reinstated the test requirement, saying it provides helpful context for the

    [it would discontinue the optional essay](https://www.npr.org/2021/01/19/958329475/sat-discontinues-subject-tests-and-optional-essay#:~:text=The%20College%20Board%20announced%20on,and%20math%2C%20among%20other%20topics.)
