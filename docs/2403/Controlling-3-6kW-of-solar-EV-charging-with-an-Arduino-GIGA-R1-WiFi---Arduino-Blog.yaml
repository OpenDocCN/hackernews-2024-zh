    more complicated that it may seem, but one fact is quite simple: it is much easier
    to generate electricity at home than it is to refine fossil fuels. This means
    that it is possible power a vehicle for free after the initial investment. But
    doing so takes quite a lot of hardware, which is why [Shawn Murphy developed this
    charging system](https://www.hackster.io/racingtogreen/solar-powered-ev-charging-with-agrivoltaics-0973c0)
    controlled by an Arduino GIGA R1 WiFi.'

    EV standards thanks to its weight. But even at just two miles per kWh of electricity,
    he estimates that he can break even on the cost of his solar charging system within
    four to five years. After that, the electricity to power the Ford will, essentially,
    be free. Any excess energy can power his home or feed back into the grid.

    10 used 360-watt solar panels. Those feed to a battery backup array, which supplies
    power to the Ford charging station.

- en: To maximize efficiency, Murphy wants the solar panels to pivot on one axis to
    follow the sun. He estimates that will increase their output by 20-25% throughout
    the day, which is a significant amount of energy with a solar panel array this
    large. An [Arduino GIGA R1 WiFi board](https://store.arduino.cc/products/giga-r1-wifi)
    controls the tilt of the panels via linear actuators. Murphy originally used “dumb”
    actuators, but is switching to “smart” models from Progressive Automations that
    include positional feedback through Hall effect sensors.

    gives Murphy access to an interface, which he can also access through the [Arduino
    Cloud](https://cloud.arduino.cc). In addition to controlling the linear actuators,
    the Arduino monitors power generation and consumption.

    as Murphy continues to make improvements, but he’s well on his way to “free” energy
    for his truck.'
