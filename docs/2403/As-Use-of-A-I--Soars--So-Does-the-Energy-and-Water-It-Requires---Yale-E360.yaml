    whatever they choose, however they choose, about their A.I. impact, says Shaolei
    Ren, an associate professor of electrical and computer engineering at UC Riverside,
    who has been studying the water costs of computation for the past decade. Working
    from calculations of annual use of water for cooling systems by Microsoft, Ren
    estimates that a person who engages in a session of questions and answers with
    GPT-3 (roughly 10 t0 50 responses) drives the consumption of a half-liter of fresh
    water. “It will vary by region, and with a bigger A.I., it could be more.” But
    a great deal remains unrevealed about the millions of gallons of water used to
    cool computers running A.I., he says.

    on specialized Graphical Processing Units — processors originally designed for
    intense computation to render graphics on computer screens. Compared to other
    chips, GPUs are more energy-efficient for A.I., and they’re most efficient when
    they’re run in large “cloud data centers” — specialized buildings full of computers
    equipped with those chips. The larger the data center, the more energy efficient
    it can be. Improvements in A.I.’s energy efficiency in recent years are partly
    due to the [construction](https://venturebeat.com/business/why-hyperscale-modular-data-centers-improve-efficiency/)
    of more “hyperscale data centers,” which contain many more computers and can quickly
    scale up. Where a typical cloud data center occupies about 100,000 square feet,

    that IEA estimate includes *all* data center activity, which extends beyond A.I.
    to many aspects of modern life. Running Amazon’s store interface, serving up Apple
    TV’s videos, storing millions of people’s emails on Gmail, and “mining” Bitcoin
    are also performed by data centers. (Other IEA [reports](https://www.iea.org/energy-system/buildings/data-centres-and-data-transmission-networks)

    as A.I. usage has increased since 2019, its percentage of Google data-center energy
    use has held at less than 15 percent. And while global internet traffic has increased
    more than twentyfold since 2010, the share of the world’s electricity used by
