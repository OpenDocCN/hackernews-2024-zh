    and song title, whereas we only need the artist and title. we can use `sed` to

- en: sed works by looping through lines of the input and doing a given action, by
    default it prints the resulting lines to stdout. we can give sed a file to work
    with but more commonly you’ll pipe a command into sed, as we’ll do later on.

    a command’s input is read from the keyboard and its output (along with any errors)
    is printed on your screen. we can, however, change this behavior.

    every column until the end of the line**, so let’s incorporate that into our script.
