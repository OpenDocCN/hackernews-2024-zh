    in the sense that entire multibillion dollar industries have arisen to fill social
    voids. DoorDash doesn’t make a dime if you go out and eat with friends, Uber would
    have to dissolve if everyone had a buddy who could drive them to the airport and

    just one problem, which is that a lack of friends (or “popularity”) has typically

    porn, a chorus of the loudest voices will reply that you must hate sex workers,
    that you clearly favor suppressing expression and hold puritanical views of the
    body. “That’s right,” says the dude with 250 tabs open in his browser. “If you
