- en: The Apple II was officially introduced at the First West Coast Computer Faire
    in April 1977, one of the very first trade shows dedicated to the newly emerging
    microcomputing industry. I loved the Computer Faires because they were attended
    by passionate hobbyists in the days before commercial forces completely dominated.

  zh: Apple II 是在 1977 年 4 月的第一届西海岸计算机展上正式推出的，这是为新兴微型计算机行业专门举办的最早的贸易展之一。我喜欢这些计算机展会，因为它们吸引了充满热情的业余爱好者，那时商业力量还没有完全主导。
- en: In April 1981, a few members of the Mac team took off the afternoon and drove
    up to San Francisco to visit the sixth West Coast Computer Faire at Brooks Hall.
    The biggest splash at the show was the unveiling of the Osborne I, from a brand
    new company named Osborne Computer, which was touted as the world's first portable
    computer.

  zh: 1981 年 4 月，Macintosh 团队的几位成员放下下午的工作，驱车来到旧金山，参加在布鲁克斯大厅举办的第六届西海岸计算机展。展会上最引人注目的是
    Osborne Computer 新公司推出的 Osborne I，被宣传为世界上第一台便携计算机。
- en: The Osborne I was the brain-child of Adam Osborne, who was a well known figure
    in the world of early microcomputers. Adam was a technical writer who founded
    a publishing company to publish crucial information about microprocessors and
    software that was sorely lacking at the time, which was eventually sold to McGraw-Hill.
    He became a controversial columnist, opining on the industry from his pulpit in
    InfoWorld and other publications. He had a populist vision of computing, touting
    a no-frills, low cost, high volume approach to the business.

  zh: Osborne I 是亚当·奥斯本的杰作，他是早期微型计算机界的知名人物。亚当是一位技术作家，创办了一个出版公司，出版当时急需的有关微处理器和软件的关键信息，最终被卖给了麦格劳·希尔。他成为一个有争议的专栏作家，在《InfoWorld》和其他出版物上发表对行业的评论。他提倡计算的大众化，推崇一种无花果、低成本、高产量的商业模式。
- en: In 1980, he decided to put his theories into practice, and founded the Osborne
    Computer Company to design, manufacture and market the Osborne 1, which was a
    low cost, one-piece, portable computer complete with a suite of bundled applications.
    He recruited Lee Felsenstein, already a microcomputing legend as the master of
    ceremonies of the Home Brew Computer Club, to design the hardware. Now, they were
    introducing the fruits of their labor at the West Coast Computer Faire, as Apple
    had done four years earlier.

  zh: 1980 年，他决定将自己的理论付诸实践，创立了 Osborne Computer 公司，设计、制造和销售 Osborne 1，这是一款低成本、一体化、便携式计算机，配备了一套捆绑的应用程序。他聘请了李·费尔森斯坦，已经是微型计算机俱乐部的主持人，作为硬件设计师。现在，他们正在西海岸计算机展上展示他们的劳动成果，就像四年前的
    Apple 一样。
- en: The Osborne 1 was on display at their crowded booth near the center of Brooks
    Hall. It looked a lot like an oversized lunch box, with a keyboard on the back
    of the lid, crammed full with two floppy drives and a tiny, 5 inch monitor in
    its center. We were a little surprised, because it looked uncannily like some
    of Jef Raskin's early sketches for the Macintosh, which Steve had recently abandoned
    for a vertically oriented design. Portable was sort of a euphemism as the thing
    weighed around 25 pounds, but at least it fit under an airline seat, barely. As
    Macintosh elitists, we were suitably grossed out by the character-based CP/M applications,
    of course, which seemed especially clumsy on the tiny, scrolling screen.

  zh: Osborne 1 展示在 Brooks Hall 中心附近他们拥挤的展位上。它看起来很像一个超大号的午餐盒，在盖子的背面有一个键盘，里面塞满了两个软盘驱动器，中间还有一个小小的
    5 英寸显示器。我们有些惊讶，因为它看起来酷似 Jef Raskin 为 Macintosh 提前放弃的一些早期草图，而后者最近改为垂直设计。虽然便携是一种委婉的说法，但这东西重约
    25 磅，但至少可以勉强放在航空公司的座位下面。作为 Macintosh 粉丝，我们对基于字符的 CP/M 应用感到相当反感，当然，在这种小巧的滚动屏幕上使用起来特别笨拙。
- en: We worked our way up to the front of the crowd to get a good look at the units
    that were on display. We started to ask one of the presenters a technical question,
    when we were suprised to see Adam Osborne himself standing a few feet from us,
    looking at our show badges, preempting the response.

  zh: 我们挤进人群前排，仔细观看展示的设备。当我们正打算向一名演讲者提出技术问题时，我们惊讶地看到亚当·奥斯本本人就站在离我们几英尺远的地方，看着我们的展会徽章，预测到了我们的反应。
- en: '"Oh, some Apple folks", he addressed us in a condescending tone, "What do you
    think? The Osborne 1 is going to outsell the Apple II by a factor of 10, don''t
    you think so? What part of Apple do you work in?"'

  zh: “哦，是一些Apple的人”，他用一种居高临下的口吻对我们说，“你们觉得呢？Osborne 1会销售超过Apple II的10倍，你们觉得呢？你们在Apple的哪个部门工作？”
- en: When we told him that we were on the Mac team, he started to chuckle. "The Macintosh,
    I heard about that. When are we going to get to see it? Well, go back and tell
    Steve Jobs that the Osborne 1 is going to outsell the Apple II and the Macintosh
    combined!"

  zh: 当我们告诉他我们是Mac团队的一员时，他开始笑了起来。“Macintosh，我听说过。我们什么时候能见到它？好吧，回去告诉Steve Jobs，Osborne
    1会销售超过Apple II和Macintosh的总和！”
- en: So, after returning to Cupertino later that afternoon, we told Steve about our
    encounter with Adam Osborne. He smiled, with a sort of mock anger, and immediately
    grabbed the telephone on the spare desk in Bud's office, and called information
    for the number of the Osborne Computer Corporation. He dialed the number, but
    it was answered by a secretary.

  zh: 所以，那天下午回到Cupertino后，我们告诉了Steve关于我们与Adam Osborne的邂逅。他微笑着，带着一种嘲讽的怒气，立即抓起Bud办公室备用桌上的电话，打电话给Osborne计算机公司的信息。他拨通了号码，但接电话的是一位秘书。

    he''s an asshole."'

  zh: “是的，” Steve回答道。他停顿了一秒。“这是我的留言。告诉Adam，他是个混蛋。”
- en: There was a long delay, as the secretary tried to figure out how to respond.
    Steve continued, "One more thing. I hear that Adam's curious about the Macintosh.
    Tell him that the Macintosh is so good that he's probably going to buy a few for
    his children even though it put his company out of business!"

  zh: 秘书试图想出如何回应，导致了漫长的延迟。Steve继续说道：“还有一件事。我听说Adam对Macintosh很好奇。告诉他，Macintosh非常出色，以至于他可能会为他的孩子买几台，尽管这款产品使他的公司破产！”
