    general Letitia James, says the “dramatic and persistent spike” in complaints
    concerning account takeovers amounts to a “substantial drain” on governmental
    resources, as many stolen accounts are also tied to financial crimes—some of which
    allegedly profits Meta directly.

    enforcement. We invest heavily in our trained enforcement and review teams and
    have specialized detection tools to identify compromised accounts and other fraudulent
    activity,” Meta says in a statement provided by spokesperson Erin McPike. “We
    regularly share tips and tools people can use to protect themselves, provide a
    means to report potential violations, work with law enforcement and take legal
    action.”

    as well as other more sophisticated and targeted techniques. Once an attacker
    gains access to an account, the owner can be easily locked out by changing passwords
    and contact information. Private messages and personal information are left up
    for grabs for a variety of nefarious purposes, from impersonation and fraud to
    pushing misinformation.

    punishing the victims—often small business owners—twice over.

    someone sneak into your home and change all of the locks,” New York's James said
    in a statement. “Social media is how millions of Americans connect with family,
    friends, and people throughout their communities and the world. To have Meta fail
    to properly protect users from scammers trying to hijack accounts and lock rightful
    owners out is unacceptable.”
