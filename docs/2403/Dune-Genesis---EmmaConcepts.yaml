    Herbert on the origins and thinking behind the novel Dune (1965) and its successors,
    along with a series of artworks by American illustrator [John Schoenherr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Schoenherr).

    six years of research and one and a half years of writing. The story was all in

    about the messianic convulsions that periodically overtake us. Demagogues, fanatics,
    con-game artists, the innocent and the not-so-innocent bystanders-all were to
    have a part in the drama. This grows from my theory that superheroes are disastrous
    for humankind. Even if we find a real hero (whatever-or whoever-that may be),
    eventually fallible mortals take over the power structure that always comes into
    being around such a leader.

    faculties to people in power, no matter how admirable those people may appear
    to be. Beneath the hero’s facade you will find a human being who makes human mistakes.
    Enormous problems arise when human mistakes are made on the grand scale available
    to a superhero. And sometimes you run into another problem.'

    the entertainment business first. It’s all right to include a pot of message,
    but that’s not the key ingredient of wide readership. Yes, there are analogs in
    Dune of today’s events-corruption and bribery in the highest places, whole police
    forces lost to organized crime, regulatory agencies taken over by the people they
    are supposed to regulate. The scarce water of Dune is an exact analog of oil scarcity.
    CHOAM is OPEC. But that was only the beginning.

    write a magazine article about a US Department of Agriculture project there. The
    USDA was seeking ways to control coastal (and other) sand dunes. I had already
    written several pieces about ecological matters, but my superhero concept filled
    me with a concern that ecology might be the next banner for demagogues and would-be-heroes,
    for the power seekers and others ready to find an adrenaline high in the launching
    of a new crusade.

    political ecology, economic ecology. It’s an open-ended list.

    beginning I was just as ready as anyone to fall into step, to seek out the guilty
    and to punish the sinners, even to become a leader. Nothing, I felt, would give
    me more gratification than riding the steed of yellow journalism into crusade,
    doing the book that would right the old wrongs.

    never ends short of death, that no society has ever achieved an absolute pinnacle,
    that all humans are not created equal. In fact, I believe attempts to create some
    abstract equalization create a morass of injustices that rebound on the equalizers.
    Equal justice and equal opportunity are ideals we should seek, but we should recognize
    that humans administer the ideals and that humans do not have equal ability.

    is played many different ways. Sometimes there are free voices that do fanciful
    dances around the interplay. There can be secondary themes and contrasts in harmony,
    rhythm, and melody. From the moment when a single voice introduces the primary
    theme, however, the whole is woven into a single fabric.

    into paradox. The central paradox concerns the human vision of time. What about
    Paul’s gift of prescience-the Presbyterian fixation? For the Delphic Oracle to
    perform, it must tangle itself in a web of predestination. Yet predestination
    negates surprises and, in fact, sets up a mathematically enclosed universe whose
    limits are always inconsistent, always encountering the unprovable. It’s like
    a koan, a Zen mind breaker. It’s like the Cretan Epimenides saying, “All Cretans
    are liars.”
