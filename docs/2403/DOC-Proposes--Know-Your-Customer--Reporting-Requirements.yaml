    products (i.e., cloud computing services) to engage in malicious cyber-enabled
    activity, specifically by imposing certain due diligence and reporting requirements
    on U.S. IaaS providers and their foreign resellers. The January 29, 2024, [Notice
    of Proposed Rule Making](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2024/01/29/2024-01580/taking-additional-steps-to-address-the-national-emergency-with-respect-to-significant-malicious) (“NPRM”)
