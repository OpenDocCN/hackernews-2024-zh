    At one, the cubicle walls were only 3 feet high, so we could all see each other.
    Visual AND aural distraction. At a summer job at Texas Instruments, we all shared

    There is always a BS reason like “encourages collaboration”. Hah. For mind workers

    and labs are where you can chat. At one summer job, the cubicle walls were 6 feet

    in ways that was better because no one would bother me. When I was at Comcast,
    I had a shared office, all glass, with three others and it was called 'the fish
    tank', because everyone could see who was in, and it was hard to get work done.

    were actually disused lab space, and barely heated, and at another company where
    it was the recently deceased company founders office and all I needed was a laptop,
    and was told "don't touch anything"....as his children bickered over who would
    get the enormous, ornate office with years of dust. I work at a route 128 firm
    where my office also double as the bicycle park, and that was no fun at all. When
    I was at Harvard, I technically had an office shared with interns, but most of
    them weren't around much so it was pretty much my own.

    in their offices with the doors closed, and the lack of overall architectural
    unity of the products showed. When I left, I chatted with the facilities manager,
    who said that they were thinking of experimenting with removing some walls between
    offices. In retrospect, part of the problem was the overall layout - no lounges
    at the stairways (Almaden Research had these), I don't remember the break rooms,
    and the cafeteria wasn't a great meeting place as I recall.

    shared by 2+ people. These had glass walls, and there was definitely more social
    interaction. But there were also cultural differences -- Canadians seemed to take
    "knock&enter" as an invitation to come into an office but Americas seemed to consider
    a closed door as "do not disturb".

    people often left their door open. But most jobs after ~1993 were in "open" spaces,
    some nicer than others.

    at <company>. And it worked brilliantly - efficiency went way up (as measured
    by more productivity metrics anyway), and most folks (okay, not everyone) liked
    the new spaces. Communication really did improve.

    together, in various permutations, and with the pods separated. There were plants
    everywhere, whiteboards everywhere, alternative places to sit everywhere. The
    space looked beautiful. And the other thing is this: I ate my own dogfood. I got
    rid of my office too and sat with everyone else, rotating around in various pods.
    Good enough for them, good enough for me. That was noted.'

    where people have a private space but there’s a large, inviting space for social
    interactions, is probably the best. But there *are* companies and cultures where
    some kind of more open arrangement really is best, much as I hate to admit it.

    I had an office, the custom was that you left your door most of the time, but
    a visitor would still knock and wait to be admitted. They wouldn’t just barge
    in. If the door was closed, they needed a good excuse but people did still knock.

    office as the engineers (they promptly reserved two next to each other).
