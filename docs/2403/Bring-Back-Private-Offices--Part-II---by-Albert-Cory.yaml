    were actually disused lab space, and barely heated, and at another company where
    it was the recently deceased company founders office and all I needed was a laptop,

    get the enormous, ornate office with years of dust. I work at a route 128 firm
    where my office also double as the bicycle park, and that was no fun at all. When
