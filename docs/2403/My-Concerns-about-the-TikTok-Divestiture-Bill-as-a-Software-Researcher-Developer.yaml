    TikTok should be sold or banned in this post. I will focus on how best to force
    the sale of TikTok if forcing that sale is the action Congress decides it wants
    to take.

    ByteDance to sell TikTok to someone else who is not controlled by China. It does
    that by threatening to make it illegal to distribute the TikTok app to Americans
    unless ByteDance sells TikTok within 180 days of the law taking effect.

    I think what the bill is *trying* to say is that if ByteDance doesn’t sell TikTok,
    U.S. based app stores have to take down TikTok for U.S. users and U.S. web hosts
    must not host the TikTok web app for U.S. users. Unfortunately, when I read the
    text, that’s not actually what they have said, because the Internet is complicated
    and it’s hard to write clear rules about it without causing unintended consequences.

    a specific exemption where the government cannot sue “an individual user of a

    to ban TikTok that have been struck down by courts as unconstitutional, because
    they violate the First Amendment. The promoters of this bill are hoping to draft
    it in such a way that it does not fall victim to that fate. I think they have
    failed.
  id: totrans-split-24

    - the part of the defines what would be illegal if TikTok refuses to sell - sucks
    pretty hard. It basically says that if ByteDance fails to sell, then Americans
    are not allowed to share or facilitate the sharing of software, including source
    code, written by ByteDance with other Americans. This is a very broad prohibition,
    a dangerous precedent, and ultimately I think a bigger hammer than is needed to
    deal with this particular nail.

    [Bernstein v. United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernstein_v._United_States)
    precedent that held that software source code was speech protected by the First
    Amendment. ^(As a hypothetical example to demonstrate the parade of horribles,
    this would seem to preclude a researcher who discovers some mechanism TikTok uses
    to censor posts about e.g. Tiananmen Square from sharing the source code or binary
    artifacts to substantiate their claims. After all, couldn’t those artifacts enable
    the distribution or updating of TikTok? If they could, and the researcher hosted
    them on the Internet to share them, then the researcher would be providing internet
    hosting services to enable the distribution or updating of a foreign adversary
    controlled application. This bill claims to make that illegal. Even if it’s ultimately
    determined that this bill *does not* prohibit that sort of thing, it still might
    require the researcher to get an expensive (thousands of dollars) legal opinion
    or to be subject to a preemptive takedown by an overzealous host. That is the
    classic “chilling effect”.)

    into the infrastructure of the Internet to effect its prohibitions. This is especially
    notable, because for a speech-regulation to be constitutional, it must among other
    things use the “least restrictive means” to achieve its goal. Laws that infringe
    on more speech rights than strictly necessary to accomplish the government’s “compelling
    purpose” are not constitutional.

    “tiktok.com” from the “.com” name servers. After all, the “.com” servers at the
    very least provide storage resources to maintain the record of what authoritative
    name servers are responsible for “tiktok.com” domain name in order to maintain
    the TikTok web app. Also, I think this prohibition has a very broad effect. Part
    B above prohibits US entities from providing hosting services to anyone who enables
    the distribution or maintenance of TikTok. I think this effect thus stretches
    beyond providing DNS services to ByteDance directly, and also prohibits providing
    DNS services to anyone who enables the distribution of TikTok to US users. So,
    for example, source code distribution websites or file hosting websites would
    have to take down TikTok source code or binary files, or else risk getting their
    domain name revoked.

- en: Finally, a related over-broadness concern I have is whether this bill would
    effect “peering”, or in other words, whether it would prohibit U.S. Internet Service
    Providers (ISPs) from routing traffic to a TikTok service hosted abroad. I think
    it all turns on what “accommodation and maintenance” means. I have not seen this
    term used before in an Internet law, so I think it is wide open to interpretation.
    On one hand, I could see a stretch argument about how a U.S. ISP allowing access
    to a TikTok service hosted abroad would be providing “computer resources” by which
    the “accommodation or maintenance” of an “online service” that “enables the distribution
    of the foreign adversary controlled application” is accomplished. On the other
    hand, to me as a software guy, peering is pretty different from the examples given
    of file hosting/virtual private server hosting/etc, but I don’t want to read too
    much into that, because I’m not sure a federal judge would see it that way.

- en: 'I think the drafters of this bill could easily dodge these First Amendment
    issues and still achieve their desired effect of threatening to de-platform TikTok
    from American platforms for American users by taking inspiration from sanctions
    law. US law already has the concept of the [“Specifically Designated Nationals
    list” (SDN list)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specially_Designated_Nationals_and_Blocked_Persons_List),
    which is a list of companies and people that US persons and businesses are prohibited
    from doing business with. There might be some concern that ByteDance does not
    currently meet the definition to be listed on the SDN list, but if Congress is
    already passing a law on this issue, they can specifically clarify that makers
    of “foreign adversary controlled applications” can be listed on the SDN list.
    I think that would be much cleaner and easier than setting up some new prohibition
    mechanism just for TikTok. It would have basically the same desired practical
    effect: Preventing US businesses from doing business with ByteDance would effectively
    cut them off from the Apple App Store, Google Play store, US web hosts, cloud
    providers, and CDNs, and any US domain registrar. It also would prevent them from
    selling advertisements to US companies, or from making deals with US record companies
    to include their music libraries in the video editor. It would also not prevent
    American researchers from publicly sharing any ByteDance-produced source code
    in their work, or American ISPs from routing traffic to foreign ISPs that later
    serve TikTok. It would still clearly kill TikTok. It just kills it without threatening
    a bunch of other probably-constitutionally-protected conduct as a side-effect.'

    very adept at dealing the SDN list. They know what they have to do when a company
    is listed on it. There is a lot of clarity there. I also think the existence of
    this alternative approach is a very strong point towards the current bill’s proposed
    enforcement mechanism not being the least restrictive means to accomplish the
    compelling government interest, and thus not meeting constitutional muster.

- en: Another concern I have with this bill is the open-ended nature of the ability
    to designate other apps as “foreign adversary controlled applications”. I think
    that it’s fine in principle, and probably necessary to have a way to react to
    future threats without another act of Congress. However, the particular conditions
    laid down by the bill are probably too lax. For one, despite using the word “controlled”,
    the bill actually only requires a twenty percent foreign stake to trigger eligibility
    to be designated. (See Section 2(g)1(b)) It’s not at all uncommon for even American-run
    social media apps to have large stakes owned by foreign people and companies.
    For example, Chinese company Tencent [did/maybe still does?](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-snap-tencent-stake-idUSKBN1D81G3/)
    own a 12 percent stake in Snapchat. A company would not become automatically designated
    just because it is 20-percent owned by Chinese investors; it would still require
    action by the President. However, I tend to think that any law that hinges the
    hope that one person will do the right thing is a bad idea, because hope is not
    a plan. It’s pretty easy to imagine, for example, a U.S. president threatening
    to designate a U.S. social media platform as “foreign adversary controlled” if
    that platform moderates his posts in a way that the President does not approve
    of.

    the very popular Russian app whose use is very significant in monitoring ransomware
    actors and in open-source intelligence of Russian military operations. I’m not
    going to take a stance here on whether the U.S. should try to force the sale of
    Telegram, but it is worth thinking about whether that’s the sort of thing we want
    to empower the government to do, or if we want to further restrict the kinds of
    national security harm that can merit this kind of action.
