    the new Dune, it popped back into my memory. Spice in Dune is like oil, a natural
    resource. But in Taiwan, there are no shai-huluds producing 3 nm chips, so how
    did it become Arrakis? Looking into its history, Taiwan is not so different from
    its neighboring countries—it wasn't an independent country with a powerful industrial
    complex like Japan, it had very few (if any) good universities, it had worse ties
    to the West than Singapore, South Korea, or Hong Kong, and it has a powerful rival/enemy
    just ~100 km away from it. So how did Taiwan become so important, how did it create
    one of the most complex industries known if all the inventions were done elsewhere,
    and it seems to be lacking any prerequisites for it? A similar question is about
    ASML—how the heck is it the only company making these wonder machines?

    “In 1963, its first year of operation, the Hong Kong facility assembled 120 million
    devices. Production quality was excellent, because low labor costs meant Fairchild
    could hire trained engineers to run assembly lines, which would have been prohibitively
    expensive in California.” Soon, other companies followed suit. In the mid-'60s
    in Hong Kong, workers earned 25 cents per hour, “Taiwanese workers made 19 cents
    an hour, Malaysians 15 cents, Singaporeans 11 cents, and South Koreans only a
    dime.” In 1968, the first factory was built by Texas Instruments in Taiwan. The
    Taiwanese minister, K. T. Li, recognized the benefits of being an American ally,
    understanding that Taiwan urgently needed allies. Communist China successfully
    tested nuclear weapons in 1964, and thermonuclear weapons after that. K. T. Li
    himself was well-educated and had industrial experience; he studied nuclear physics
    at Cambridge and ran a steel mill. He correctly predicted that the more American
    assets and factories there are in Taiwan, the more willing America would be to
    provide safety guarantees to the island.

    很快，其他公司也纷纷效仿。在60年代中期的香港，工人每小时赚25美分，“台湾工人每小时19美分，马来西亚人15美分，新加坡人11美分，韩国人仅有一角。” 1968年，德州仪器在台湾建立了第一家工厂。台湾部长李宽慎意识到成为美国盟友的好处，理解台湾急需盟友。1964年，共产中国成功试验了核武器，此后又试验了热核武器。李宽慎本人受过良好教育并有工业经验；他在剑桥大学学习过核物理并经营过一家钢铁厂。他正确预测，美国在台湾的资产和工厂越多，美国愿意为该岛提供安全保障的可能性越大。

    instead, he wanted to copy existing American chips, centering the entire semiconductor
    industry in the USSR on recreating these chips. Without mass-scale production,
    yields were poor, and the USSR consistently lagged 3-5 years behind. In the KGB,

    it into plasma. The plasma emits extreme ultraviolet (EUV) radiation that is focused
    into a beam and bounced through a series of mirrors. The mirrors are so smooth
    that if expanded to the size of Germany they would not have a bump higher than
    a millimeter. Finally, the EUV beam hits a silicon wafer—itself a marvel of materials
    science—with a precision equivalent to shooting an arrow from Earth to hit an
    apple placed on the moon. This allows the EUV machine to draw transistors into
    the wafer with features measuring only five nanometers—approximately the length

    First comes the silicon wafer. A projector, its lens covered by a crystal plate
    inscribed with distinctive patterns, is craned over the wafer. Extreme ultraviolet
    light is then beamed through the plate and onto the wafer, printing a design on
    it before it’s bathed in chemicals to etch along the pattern. This happens again
    and again until dozens of latticed layers are printed on the silicon. Finally
    the chips are cut out of the wafer. Each chip, with billions of transistors stacked
    on it, amounts to an atomic multidimensional chessboard with billions of squares.
    The potential combinations of ons and offs can only be considered endless.*'

    struck by the ambition and the work ethic that drove TSMC. The ambition stemmed
    from Morris Chang’s vision of world-beating technology, evident in his willingness
    to spend huge sums expanding TSMC’s R&D team from 120 people in 1997 to 7,000
    in 2013\. This hunger permeated the entire company. “People worked so much harder
    in Taiwan,” Chiang explained. Because manufacturing tools account for much of
    the cost of an advanced fab, keeping the equipment operating is crucial for profitability.
    **In the U.S., Chiang said, if something broke at 1 a.m., the engineer would fix
    it the next morning. At TSMC, they’d fix it by 2 a.m. “They do not complain,”
    he explained, and “their spouse does not complain” either.** With Chiang back
    in charge of R&D, TSMC charged forward toward EUV. He had no difficulty finding
    employees to work all night long.*'

    ambitious, and their 'Made in China 2025' initiative is particularly interesting.
    The CHIPS Act could either be a great success or a great failure. Intel is keen
    to use High NA machines, and who knows, maybe TSMC is in trouble. But right now,
    TSMC and ASML are the most important companies in the world, and Taiwan has become
    Arrakis.

    with the US, licensed or your own technologies, and a ton of luck. Or, who knows,
