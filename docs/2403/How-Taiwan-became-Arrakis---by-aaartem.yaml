    the new Dune, it popped back into my memory. Spice in Dune is like oil, a natural
    resource. But in Taiwan, there are no shai-huluds producing 3 nm chips, so how
    did it become Arrakis? Looking into its history, Taiwan is not so different from
    its neighboring countries—it wasn't an independent country with a powerful industrial
    complex like Japan, it had very few (if any) good universities, it had worse ties
    to the West than Singapore, South Korea, or Hong Kong, and it has a powerful rival/enemy
    just ~100 km away from it. So how did Taiwan become so important, how did it create
    one of the most complex industries known if all the inventions were done elsewhere,
    and it seems to be lacking any prerequisites for it? A similar question is about
    ASML—how the heck is it the only company making these wonder machines?

    Bob Noyce, who had left Shockley Semiconductor a year earlier, invented the same
    thing, but without any freestanding wires; instead, he deposited lines of metal

    “In 1963, its first year of operation, the Hong Kong facility assembled 120 million
    devices. Production quality was excellent, because low labor costs meant Fairchild
    could hire trained engineers to run assembly lines, which would have been prohibitively
    expensive in California.” Soon, other companies followed suit. In the mid-'60s
    in Hong Kong, workers earned 25 cents per hour, “Taiwanese workers made 19 cents
    an hour, Malaysians 15 cents, Singaporeans 11 cents, and South Koreans only a
    dime.” In 1968, the first factory was built by Texas Instruments in Taiwan. The
    Taiwanese minister, K. T. Li, recognized the benefits of being an American ally,
    understanding that Taiwan urgently needed allies. Communist China successfully
    tested nuclear weapons in 1964, and thermonuclear weapons after that. K. T. Li
    himself was well-educated and had industrial experience; he studied nuclear physics

    they were able to build the atomic bomb, launch the first satellite, and send
    the first man into space, but they had a very strict hierarchy and a huge problem

    products, they invented processes that made chips cheaper and better. They continuously
    upgraded their facilities to manufacture better chips, faster, and at as low a
    cost as possible. They were also able to hire the best people from the best universities
    and competed for them. These top talents were also able to start their own companies,

    and if your lab was tasked with developing something, you couldn''t argue. What''s
    worse, many such developments were top-secret, and nobody—not even other researchers!—knew

    on the contrary, the most important company in the entire industry is from the
    Netherlands, ASML. Founded by Philips in 1987, ASML is a manufacturer of photolithographic
    machines and has a 100% monopoly on extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUV) machines.
    The development of EUV was described as a marvel of engineering. The machine is
    called “[The $150 Million Machine Keeping Moore’s Law Alive](https://archive.is/0dxn4)”,
    and was [compared to the Manhattan Project](https://archive.is/TchSb) and to [“engineering

    I think it's more aptly comparable to the latest physics equipment, like the Large
    Hadron Collider with its detectors or the gravitational wave detectors, which
    require large collaborations, cutting-edge engineering, and billions of dollars
    to run the show.

    from Intel, Samsung, and TSMC (ASML’s largest customers). Few people, even from
    the industry, believed in its success. The machine is nightmarishly complex and

- en: An extreme ultraviolet lithography machine is a technological marvel. A generator
    ejects 50,000 tiny droplets of molten tin per second. A high-powered laser blasts
    each droplet twice. The first shapes the tiny tin, so the second can vaporize
    it into plasma. The plasma emits extreme ultraviolet (EUV) radiation that is focused
    into a beam and bounced through a series of mirrors. The mirrors are so smooth
    that if expanded to the size of Germany they would not have a bump higher than
    a millimeter. Finally, the EUV beam hits a silicon wafer—itself a marvel of materials
    science—with a precision equivalent to shooting an arrow from Earth to hit an
    apple placed on the moon. This allows the EUV machine to draw transistors into
    the wafer with features measuring only five nanometers—approximately the length
    your fingernail grows in five seconds. This wafer with billions or trillions of
    transistors is eventually made into computer chips.
