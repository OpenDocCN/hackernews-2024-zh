    the whole cake, and eating it too. It’s no shock the boardroom is able to stay
    above the fray as wealthy members are more equipped to weather economic downturns.
    But it turns out CEOs and shareholders are walking away with an even greater slice
    of profits than one might think.

    in light of economic strain. But it seems as if corporations are doing better
    than ever. Revenue and profits at Fortune 500 companies grew significantly between
    2014 and 2022, hiking even more in the years after the pandemic hit. In the same
    breath that Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg announced layoffs for more than 10,000 workers

    started to take hold in the 1970s, per Tamir, who added that while companies started
    to prioritize this group, safeguards for workers were fading as union membership
    ebbed. In the 1980s, stock buybacks, once banned as a form of [stock manipulation](https://www.spglobal.com/spdji/en/documents/research/research-sp-examining-share-repurchases-and-the-sp-buyback-indices.pdf),
    became legal; Tamir says this change, specifically, allowed companies to inflate
    their stock prices. At the same time, corporate tax rates fell dramatically thanks
    to a series of tax cuts, first in the Reagan era and again during the Trump administration,
    while corporations gained more and more ability to directly influence politics,
    capped off with the 2010 *Citizens United* decision, in which the Supreme Court
    gave companies and wealthy individuals carte blanche to spend unlimited amounts
    of money on elections.
