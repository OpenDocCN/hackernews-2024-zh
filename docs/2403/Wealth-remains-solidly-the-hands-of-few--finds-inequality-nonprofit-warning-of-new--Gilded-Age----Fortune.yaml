    the whole cake, and eating it too. It’s no shock the boardroom is able to stay
    above the fray as wealthy members are more equipped to weather economic downturns.
    But it turns out CEOs and shareholders are walking away with an even greater slice
    of profits than one might think.

    from Oxfam, a British nonprofit focused on eradicating poverty, which analyzed
    more than 200 U.S. corporations to assess their “inequality footprint.” Most money
    ends up funneling into the mouths of those at the top, as 90% (or $1.1 trillion)
    of the combined $1.25 trillion in net profits for those companies analyzed went
    to paying wealthy shareholders.

    in the finance, tech, and media sectors as many CEOs claim to need to downsize
    in light of economic strain. But it seems as if corporations are doing better
    than ever. Revenue and profits at Fortune 500 companies grew significantly between
    2014 and 2022, hiking even more in the years after the pandemic hit. In the same
    breath that Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg announced layoffs for more than 10,000 workers
    in the name of a “[year of efficiency](https://fortune.com/2023/02/22/meta-mark-zuckerberg-reportedly-planning-thousands-more-layoffs/),”
    the company announced a fresh [$40 billion](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/02/01/facebook-parent-meta-announces-40-billion-stock-buyback.html)
    stock-buyback option. Less than a year later, Meta announced plans to buy back
    [another $50 billion](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/02/01/meta-is-paying-first-ever-dividend-authorizes-50-billion-buyback.html).

    of [shareholder primacy](https://fortune.com/2023/04/24/corporations-rules-capitalism-corporate-governance-politics-lobbying-maureen-kline/)
    started to take hold in the 1970s, per Tamir, who added that while companies started
    to prioritize this group, safeguards for workers were fading as union membership
    ebbed. In the 1980s, stock buybacks, once banned as a form of [stock manipulation](https://www.spglobal.com/spdji/en/documents/research/research-sp-examining-share-repurchases-and-the-sp-buyback-indices.pdf),
    became legal; Tamir says this change, specifically, allowed companies to inflate
    their stock prices. At the same time, corporate tax rates fell dramatically thanks
    to a series of tax cuts, first in the Reagan era and again during the Trump administration,
    while corporations gained more and more ability to directly influence politics,
    capped off with the 2010 *Citizens United* decision, in which the Supreme Court
    gave companies and wealthy individuals carte blanche to spend unlimited amounts
    of money on elections.

    or barely high enough to compete with the pace of inflation, CEOs have given themselves
    a hefty raise. CEOs were paid a combined $4.1 billion in 2022, per Oxfam’s analysis
    of the 186 companies that had hard data. Only 5% of the companies examined publicly
    said they support a living wage. The wage gap continues to widen among larger
    companies: McDonald’s, for instance, has a CEO-to-worker pay gap of 1,745 to one.
