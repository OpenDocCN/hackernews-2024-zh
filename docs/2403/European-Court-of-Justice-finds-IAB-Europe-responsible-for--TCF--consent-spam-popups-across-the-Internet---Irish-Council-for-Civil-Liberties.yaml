- en: Europe’s highest court today delivered a judgement about the consent spam popups
    that have plagued people for years all over the Internet in Europe. The Court
    has ruled that IAB Europe, a tracking industry association, is responsible under
    the GDPR for the “Transparency and Consent Framework” (TCF) consent system. Google,
    Amazon, Microsoft, TikTok, and hundreds of other tracking-based online advertising
    companies rely on IAB Europe’s consent system, which Europe’s data protection
    authorities have already found to be in violation of the GDPR following our complaint.

- en: IAB Europe commits multiple violations of the GDPR in its processing of personal
    data in the context of its TCF and the “Real-Time Bidding” (RTB) online advertising
    system. The TCF has been used to falsely legitimise the indiscriminate broadcasting
    of personal data of millions of people in Europe to companies everywhere, including
    to companies in China and Russia.[^([1])](#_ftn1) This happens 71 trillion times
    per year.[^([2])](#_ftn2)

- en: IAB Europe argued that it is not responsible under the GDPR as a “data controller”
    because it allegedly only sets the rules for how data should be used, but does
    not process the data itself. The Court rightly rejected this, and confirmed that
    IAB Europe, as management body for the TCF, is a “data controller” under the GDPR.

- en: The Court’s ruling today shows just how broad the protection of people’s personal
    data is in Europe. The online tracking and advertising industry is surreptitiously
    collecting and broadcasting highly sensitive data about everyone who uses the
    internet. Today’s decision will force the industry to change profoundly. Google,
    Amazon, Microsoft, and so on can no longer evade their responsibilities by claiming
    that the data they use is not protected by the law.

    on almost every website and app since the GDPR was introduced almost six years
    ago*”, said Dr Johnny Ryan of ICCL Enforce. “*IAB Europe has sought to evade its
    responsibility for this charade. But the European Court of Justice has set it
    straight. This decision will not only end the biggest spam operation in history.
    It will deal a mortal wound to the online tracking-based advertising industry.*”

- en: The questions answered by the Court today were posed by complainants coordinated
    by Enforce, a unit of the Irish Council for Civil Liberties (ICCL). The group
    of complainants includes: Dr Johnny Ryan of [Enforce](https://www.iccl.ie/enforce/),
    Katarzyna Szymielewicz of the [Panoptykon Foundation](https://en.panoptykon.org/)
    (Poland), [Stichting Bits of Freedom](https://www.bitsoffreedom.nl/) (the Netherlands), [Ligue
    des Droits Humains](https://www.liguedh.be/) (Belgium), [Dr Jef Ausloos](https://twitter.com/Jausl00s),
    and [Dr Pierre Dewitte](https://twitter.com/PiDewitte). The ruling follows complaints
    about the insecurity of the online advertising “Real-Time Bidding” (RTB) system
    that Dr Ryan initiated in 2018.

    27 other EU data protection authorities, ruled that the “TCF” consent spam system
    is illegal.[^([3])](#_ftn3) This decision meant that the entire online advertising
    had unlawfully processed the data of everyone in Europe for years.

    appealed the substance of the decision, and the complainants appealed against
    part of its implementation. Questions that the complainants proposed were referred
    by the Brussels Markets Court to the European Court of Justice in September 2023.

    that IAB Europe is indeed responsible, and that the data concerned are protected
    by the GDPR.
