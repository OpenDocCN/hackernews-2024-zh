    which detailed how Musk‚Äôs ‚Äúamnesty‚Äù policy, introduced shortly after he bought
    Twitter, returned some of the worst people to the platform. CCDH looked at 10
    of the highest-profile accounts, including such luminaries as Andrew Tate, an

    CCDH, arguing that their goal wasn‚Äôt to expose the hate on the platform but instead

    Musk didn‚Äôt bother to explain how CCDH, a non-profit with no role at X, could

    only true if you define ‚Äúfree speech‚Äù to mean ‚Äúallowing the right wing to take
    over social media and turn it into a hellhole.‚Äù Actual free speech, however, means
    not suing companies who are reporting on what happens on your platform. So, besides
    asking the court to throw out the case, CCDH filed a motion to strike the lawsuit
    under California‚Äôs anti-SLAPP statute.

    goes after a defendant for exercising their free speech rights about a matter
    of public concern. These lawsuits aren‚Äôt necessarily brought because the plaintiff
    expects to prevail but instead to grind the other side down or frighten them enough
    into not speaking out. Thirty-three states have [some version](https://www.rcfp.org/anti-slapp-legal-guide/#:~:text=Minnesota%20previously%20passed%20an%20anti,retaliation%20for%20petitioning%20the%20government.)

    allows the defendant to file a motion to strike the lawsuit, which stops all the
    other processes in a case, like discovery. SLAPP lawsuits are often deployed with
    the hope of bilking a defendant dry with outrageous discovery demands and multiple
    motions. Putting everything on hold while the court addresses the anti-SLAPP motion
    protects the defendant from those costs. Further, the law also allows defendants
    who prevail [to recover](https://www.casp.net/california-anti-slapp-first-amendment-law-resources/statutes/c-c-p-section-425-16/)
    attorney fees and costs.

    argued that obtaining data and writing about X was a ‚Äúquintessential newsgathering
    activity‚Äù in furtherance of CCDH‚Äôs speech. Being sued for doing that is a classic
    SLAPP. CCDH also highlighted how X‚Äôs breach of contract claim was weak sauce.
    The claim for breach was based on X saying that using a scraping tool violated
    the site‚Äôs terms of service. CCDH argued that X was using the terms of service,
    which every user is required to sign, to prohibit and penalize First Amendment-protected
    research and reporting.

    that anyone using Twitter agreed to terms prohibiting them from newsgathering
    or critical reporting. CCDH [took aim](https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cand.416212/gov.uscourts.cand.416212.47.0_1.pdf)

    than a breach of contract. Breach of contract cases focus on the words in a contract
    and detail how the other party violated a term. Defamation claims focus on what
    a defendant said or wrote and alleges that the defendant lied. But, as CCDH noted
    in [their motion](https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cand.416212/gov.uscourts.cand.416212.47.0_1.pdf),
    X didn‚Äôt assert a defamation claim because to do so, it would have to prove that
    CCDH said something knowingly false. X would also have to allow discovery as to
    the truth of the content on the platform, which Musk definitely doesn‚Äôt want.

    bemoaning the harm to its reputation, and seeking punishing damages‚Äù based on
    assertions that CCDH harmed its reputation. He also explained that a plaintiff

    from a breach of contract claim would be limited to whatever minor harm CCDH could
    have caused by improperly scraping X. But the demand for tens of millions of dollars
    was because CCDH‚Äôs reports allegedly caused advertisers to stop advertising. That
