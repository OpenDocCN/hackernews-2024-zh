    British Library “should be applauded” for refusing to pay an extortion fee to
    the criminals behind a ransomware attack last year.

- en: The British Library — the national library of the United Kingdom and an archive
    of millions of books and manuscripts — was hit by an initially [unspecified attack](https://therecord.media/british-library-cyberattack-outages)
    last October, although internally the cause was known to be ransomware.

    credit and [attempted to sell](https://therecord.media/british-library-ransomware-hackers-stole-hr-data)
    the library’s stolen personnel data.

    including access to its online catalog — [described](https://blogs.bl.uk/living-knowledge/2024/01/restoring-our-services-an-update.html)
    as “one of the most important datasets for researchers around the world” by the
    library’s chief executive, Sir Roly Keating.

    left the majority of the library’s digital infrastructure unusable. Recovery is
    still ongoing five months later, with the infrastructure rebuild expected to be
    complete by mid-April, at which point the library will begin restoring its systems
    in a phased manner.

    earlier this month. The move to publish the review — in stark contrast to the
    secrecy which most organizations respond to ransomware attacks with — was widely
    acclaimed.

    Felicity Oswald, wrote: “By responding to its attack in the transparent way that
    it has, the library has set a great example. We encourage all organisations to

    work and that it’s worth doing again,” and applauded the decision not to pay.

    when and how the attack took place, including a suspected instance of hostile
    reconnaissance a few days before the major ransomware attack of Saturday 28 October.”

    to where the British Library’s existing security measures fell short, “in spite
    of the routine use of security assessments including penetration tests where appropriate.”

    communications strategy.” This guidance meant the British Library “sought to keep
    users, staff and stakeholders updated about what was happening without sharing
    detail that could aid the attackers.”

    by a parliamentary committee of taking the “ostrich strategy” by burying its head
    in the sand over the “large and imminent” national cyber threat posed by ransomware.
    The committee had previously [warned](https://therecord.media/uk-government-risking-catastrophic-ransomware)
    that the government’s failures to tackle the threat meant there was a “high risk”
    the country faces a “catastrophic ransomware attack at any moment.”
