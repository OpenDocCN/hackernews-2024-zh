- en: A new study found that influencers play a significant role in the financial
    decisions made by young Dutch people. Roughly two-thirds of young people between

- en: '"Due to this influence, 39 percent of young people who follow influencers have
    made money, 46 percent saved money and 29 percent lost money," according to Wijzer
    in Geldzaken, a project from the Ministry of Finance to promote better understanding
    of money-related issues. "Young people also indicate that both phishing emails
    and advertising from influencers are becoming increasingly difficult to recognize
    (31% and 28%)."'

- en: The study also found that young people earning their own money are less susceptible
    to this influence. Those who work a part-time job said their decisions were less
    affected by influencers than those who receive money from their parents or student
    loans. Finance influencers, or "finfluencers," are increasingly becoming a concern,
    said Eva van Reijmersdal, an associated professor at the University of Amsterdam's
    School of Communication Science.
