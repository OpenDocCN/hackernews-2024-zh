- en: A new study found that influencers play a significant role in the financial
    decisions made by young Dutch people. Roughly two-thirds of young people between
    the ages of 16 and 19 said that they have been swayed by an influencer regarding
    their own financial situation.

    made money, 46 percent saved money and 29 percent lost money," according to Wijzer
    in Geldzaken, a project from the Ministry of Finance to promote better understanding
    of money-related issues. "Young people also indicate that both phishing emails
    and advertising from influencers are becoming increasingly difficult to recognize
    (31% and 28%)."'

    to this influence. Those who work a part-time job said their decisions were less
    affected by influencers than those who receive money from their parents or student
    loans. Finance influencers, or "finfluencers," are increasingly becoming a concern,
    said Eva van Reijmersdal, an associated professor at the University of Amsterdam's
    School of Communication Science.

    that unconscious influence lurks," she said. "Young adults are in a period of
    transition and appear to be very receptive to the advice of these types of influencers."'

    problems last year, with 13 percent spending beyond their means, 10 percent owing
    money to those close to them, and 10 percent making payments on products purchased.
    Also, 30 percent said they have difficulty dealing with impulse purchases, while
    40 percent had to teach themselves tricks to prevent spontaneously buying something
    nice or luxuriuous.

    about financial matters. The researchers looked more closely at content related
    to making money or saving it. An estimated 42 percent frequently see online gambling
    advertisements, and 37 percent make in-game purchases.

    For example, the majority of young people do not believe that influencers solely
    promote products they believe in, that they are telling the truth and/or are honest
    about products. But they do enjoy following them," the study found.'

    universities often find themselves wanting something peddled by an influencer.
    However, only 21 percent of higher vocational students and 19 percent of secondary
    school students feel that way.
