    between adjacent numbers⁸ These differences are sometimes called *moving ranges*
    – hence the name XmR chart. It is based on the X values themselves and their moving
    ranges.. The difference between the first two numbers (86 and 96) is 10, the difference
    between the second two (96 and 65) is 31, and so on.

- en: The number 2.66 seems like a magic constant, and it is. There’s a little information
    in the appendix on where it comes from. The important thing is that you use specifically
    2.66, no more, and no less. It’s very important, because people will ask you to
    use something different, and you must not oblige.⁹ See below about *The Voice
    of the Process*.

- en: These natural process limits indicate the range of sales calls numbers we can
    expect from Alice, assuming she doesn’t change anything fundamental about how
    she works. The process limits incidate the amount of week-to-week variation in
    her work process. They are a measure of the amount of common cause variation,
    the amount of noise.

- en: In other words, you should not be surprised if Alice makes 35 calls one week,
    because that’s within the process limits. It’s just like rolling snake eyes when
    throwing dice. Rare, sure, but it does happen. It’s fully within the range of
    outcomes you should expect of the process. Similarly, some weeks she might get
    lucky and make 128 calls – nothing extraordinary has changed that week; Alice
    just got lucky within her regular process.

    We can predict her future performance based on the past. The name *stable process*
    is a bit confusing because a stable process is one where the outcome is completely
    random. A stable process is one where we cannot predict any individual value,
    but we know the range into which almost all values will fall.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In traditional spc litterature, stable processes are known as *in (statistical)
    control* or *controlled*. What is meant by this is that we have already controlled
    for all the significant external factors, and there is nothing left we can control
    to determine the outcome. We just have to let the process run on its own and produce
    what it is tuned for.

- en: When you have a stable process such as this, you don’t have to re-compute the
    process limits each week. One of the defining features of a stable process is
    that any given week, statistically, looks like any other week. Because of this,
    you can just extend the process limits you have already computed indefinitely
    into the future.
