    you won't be disappointed. For those who've never tried Linux or KDE Plasma, now
    is a great time to do so. It's smooth, it's beautiful, it's stable, and it's ready
    for prime time.

    bigger than ever? Not necessarily. Is it bolder, fresher, and better tasting?
    Maybe. "Megarelease" means that it not only includes KDE Plasma 6, but also, KDE
    Frameworks 6.0, and KDE Gear 24.02 apps. In other words, everything that comes
    together to make the KDE Desktop work as a well-oiled machine has all been updated
    to the latest release.

    working with Qt 6 (the foundational that works to ensure seamless integration
    with the desktop) but you'll also find features like the floating panel (now the
    default), a refreshed default theme, Wayland as the default, and the return of
    one of my favorite desktop effects of old…the desktop cube!

    ever seen. But it's not just what you immediately see that makes this special;
    it's also the speed at which everything works, the smooth animations, and, yeah,
    the new wallpapers.

    and found it to be familiar to KDE Plasma 5 with several key (but subtle) differences.
    The official release of KDE Plasma 6 just solidifies that initial opinion and
    has me believing KDE Plasma might well be the best desktop environment for Linux
    on the market.

    desktop and I'd never once considered KDE Plasma as my default. My problem has
    always been that it looked too much like a Windows interface and I wanted nothing
    to do with that.

- en: But this latest iteration has me questioning that stance…because it's just so
    good. I can even shrink the floating panel so it functions more like a dock. With
    that configuration, it's more like an elementary OS or Ubuntu Budgie than a Windows
    UI. Couple that with the transparent menus and it's 100% up my alley.

    I've ever experienced the KDE Plasma desktop running as fast as this. Applications
    open and minimize/maximize almost immediately, and the search is just blazingly
    quick. And, of course, as always, with KDE Plasma, there are tons of customizations
    to be had. You could spend hours tweaking the desktop and still keep finding more
    fun.
