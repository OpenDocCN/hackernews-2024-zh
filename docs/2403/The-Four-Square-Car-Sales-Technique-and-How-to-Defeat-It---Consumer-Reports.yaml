- en: For years, dealerships have been using a tactic called a “four square”—a sheet
    of paper divided into four boxes where the salesperson will write down your trade
    value, the purchase price of the vehicle you’re buying, your down payment, and
    your monthly payment. At the top, there’s usually a place to sign your initials
    to indicate that you intend to buy the car if you like the deal.

  zh: 多年来，销售商一直在使用一种叫做“四方格”的策略——一张纸分成四个格子，销售人员会在上面写下你的交易价值、购买的车辆价格、首付款以及月供。在顶部，通常有一个地方让你签字，表示你打算购买这辆车如果你满意这个交易。
- en: The details of the technique may have changed over the years since Consumerist
    reporter Ben Popken talked to car salesperson Allen Slone about the four square
    in 2007—we’ve seen “deal sheets” or “order sheets” without the four boxes—but
    the basic formula remains the same.

  zh: 自 Consumerist 记者 Ben Popken 在 2007 年与汽车销售员 Allen Slone 谈论四方格以来，这项技术的细节可能已经发生了变化——我们已经看到没有四个方框的“交易单”或“订单单”——但基本公式保持不变。
- en: “It looks really unassuming on its face, but it’s designed to make you pay more
    and not realize what’s going on,” Slone explained in the Consumerist article.
    Salespeople will write in big letters, turn the sheet over, and write over and
    cross out numbers to make it as confusing as possible, all in an attempt “to wear
    you down and make you sign.”

  zh: “这看起来非常不起眼，但它的设计是让你多付钱，而你却不明白发生了什么，” Slone 在 Consumerist 的文章中解释道。销售人员会用大字写下，翻过来，在上面写和划掉数字，尽可能地搞得混乱，所有这些都是试图“消耗你的耐心，让你签下合同”的手段。
- en: Zach Shefska says the whole point of a four square is to focus a buyer’s mind
    on a monthly payment instead of the total price of the vehicle. “Sales managers
    are trained to talk about monthly payment. By talking about monthly payment, you’re
    obfuscating variables that are profit centers for the dealership,” he says. For
    example, dealers can raise the price of the vehicle but lower the monthly payment
    by stretching a loan from three years to six years.

  zh: Zach Shefska 说，四方格的整个目的是让买家把注意力集中在月供上，而不是车辆的总价格。“销售经理被训练成要讨论月供。通过谈论月供，你就模糊了销售商赚钱的变量，”他说。例如，销售商可以提高车辆价格，但通过将贷款期限从三年拉长到六年，降低月供。
- en: Sometimes, salespeople will ask you to initial a piece of paper next to a written
    promise that you’ll buy the car if the numbers are agreeable to both parties.
    Ray Shefska says this is an attempt to shame buyers into purchasing a vehicle
    even if they aren’t ready.

  zh: 有时，销售人员会要求您在一张纸旁边签上一个书面承诺，如果双方都同意的话，你会购买这辆车。Ray Shefska 说，这是一种企图通过羞辱买家来促使他们购买汽车的方式，即使他们还没有准备好。
- en: “The sales manager can come out and say, ‘Doesn’t your word mean anything?’”
    In reality, Shefska says, “It’s just a ploy to say you signed it, you committed
    to it—there’s nothing legal about it, but it allows you to try and shame the customer
    into completing a transaction.”

  zh: “销售经理可能会出来说，‘你的诺言不值得信吗？’”事实上，Shefska 说，“这只是一个策略，让你说你签了字，你承诺了——法律上没有任何约束力，但它允许你试图羞辱客户以完成交易。”

    from the financing. CR usually recommends that you [get preapproved for an auto
    loan from a bank or credit union](https://www.consumerreports.org/money/car-financing/how-to-shop-for-a-car-loan-a2742917735/)
    before you reach out to a dealership. That way the dealership can’t try to [manipulate
    the length of the loan or the interest rate](https://www.consumerreports.org/money/car-financing/dont-rush-into-an-84-month-car-loan-a9535693332/).
    If the dealership offers a lower rate, you can take advantage of it instead.'

- en: At the dealership, use a loan calculator on your phone—like [this simple one
    from the Dallas Federal Reserve Bank](https://www.dallasfed.org/educate/calculators/closed-calc)—to
    figure out what the price you’ve negotiated will translate to as a monthly payment.
    Put in your interest rate, your loan term in months, and the total purchase price
    of the vehicle, and it will show you what your monthly payment should be and how
    much you’re paying in interest charges alone. Use it to double-check the dealership’s
    math, too.

  zh: 在经销商处，可以使用手机上的贷款计算器，比如[达拉斯联邦储备银行提供的这个简易计算器](https://www.dallasfed.org/educate/calculators/closed-calc)，来计算你已经谈好的价格如何转化为每月支付金额。输入你的利率、贷款期限（以月计算）、车辆的总购买价格，它将显示你每月应支付的金额以及单单利息费用。同时可以用它来检查经销商的数学计算是否准确。
