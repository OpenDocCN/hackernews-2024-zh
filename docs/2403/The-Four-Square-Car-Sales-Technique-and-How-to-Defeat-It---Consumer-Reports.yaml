- en: For years, dealerships have been using a tactic called a “four square”—a sheet
    of paper divided into four boxes where the salesperson will write down your trade
    value, the purchase price of the vehicle you’re buying, your down payment, and
    your monthly payment. At the top, there’s usually a place to sign your initials
    to indicate that you intend to buy the car if you like the deal.

    reporter Ben Popken talked to car salesperson Allen Slone about the four square
    in 2007—we’ve seen “deal sheets” or “order sheets” without the four boxes—but
    the basic formula remains the same.

    and not realize what’s going on,” Slone explained in the Consumerist article.
    Salespeople will write in big letters, turn the sheet over, and write over and
    cross out numbers to make it as confusing as possible, all in an attempt “to wear
    you down and make you sign.”

    on a monthly payment instead of the total price of the vehicle. “Sales managers
    are trained to talk about monthly payment. By talking about monthly payment, you’re
    obfuscating variables that are profit centers for the dealership,” he says. For
    example, dealers can raise the price of the vehicle but lower the monthly payment
    by stretching a loan from three years to six years.

    promise that you’ll buy the car if the numbers are agreeable to both parties.
    Ray Shefska says this is an attempt to shame buyers into purchasing a vehicle
    even if they aren’t ready.

    In reality, Shefska says, “It’s just a ploy to say you signed it, you committed
    to it—there’s nothing legal about it, but it allows you to try and shame the customer
    into completing a transaction.”

    from the financing. CR usually recommends that you [get preapproved for an auto
    loan from a bank or credit union](https://www.consumerreports.org/money/car-financing/how-to-shop-for-a-car-loan-a2742917735/)
    before you reach out to a dealership. That way the dealership can’t try to [manipulate
    the length of the loan or the interest rate](https://www.consumerreports.org/money/car-financing/dont-rush-into-an-84-month-car-loan-a9535693332/).
    If the dealership offers a lower rate, you can take advantage of it instead.'

- en: At the dealership, use a loan calculator on your phone—like [this simple one
    from the Dallas Federal Reserve Bank](https://www.dallasfed.org/educate/calculators/closed-calc)—to
    figure out what the price you’ve negotiated will translate to as a monthly payment.
    Put in your interest rate, your loan term in months, and the total purchase price
    of the vehicle, and it will show you what your monthly payment should be and how
    much you’re paying in interest charges alone. Use it to double-check the dealership’s
    math, too.
