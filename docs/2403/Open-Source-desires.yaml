- en: The disillusioning state of open source software makes it easier to see the
    real desires, and strength of those desires, that motivate people to write and
    release open source software.

- en: The political hopes that free software would help build a more free and anti-capitalist
    future are largely forgotten, and when remembered, seem embarrassingly specific
    to a certain mode of computing.

    evaluate job applicants is now, thankfully, understood as pernicious.

    by one person, and that it is rare for such projects to receive substantial contributions
    from other developers that improve the project.

    so unlucky to build a popular project are similarly notorious.

    just young developers, but veteran open source developers, with no illusions left,
    continue to create and share new, useful projects.

- en: People want to create things that are beautiful and things that are useful to
    other people. They want their skills and contributions to be acknowledged and
    appreciated by their peers. They want to help define how work gets done within
    their area of practice. They want to have the time and control to build something
    the way they judge best. They want to build something that encapsulates what they
    have learned about a corner of their craft in a form that has some chance of lasting.
    They want to make something good and whole and be able to point to it as their
    own work.

    build and release open source software. And, this despite all the psychic costs
    of actually making something that lots of people want to use.

- en: The types of desires that motivate open-source developers are the same as those
    of creative people in other fields, including fields where the norms are to charge
    for your work and to not license it permissively. If programmers could somehow
    satisfy these desires without giving away their work for free, I believe most
    of the open-source developers would not be open-source developers. It is a means
    to an end.
