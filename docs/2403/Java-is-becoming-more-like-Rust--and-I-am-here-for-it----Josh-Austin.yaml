    And for good reason: Rust enables developers to avoid entire categories of problems
    thanks to the compiler. The compiler demands correctness to the point some developers

- en: There are myriad (good) reasons that Java will never become Rust, but I’m glad
    to see some of Rust’s strong features making their way into Java. This will strengthen
    Java’s long-term placement as one of the programming languages of choice in the
    business world. Java has owned significant market share for the last 28 years
    and is poised to retain, if not regain significant market share over the next
    28 years because of the OpenJDK project’s dedication to developer productivity.
