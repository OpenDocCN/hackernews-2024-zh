- en: Many important cellular functions occur during sleep, including the brain’s
    removal of waste and toxins. However, researchers previously lacked an understanding
    of the mechanisms behind this complex process. Now, research involving mice [recently
    published](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07108-6) in *Nature* suggests that
    brain waves are responsible for the self-cleansing.

- en: Researchers observed neurons in the brains of sleeping mice. As neurons fired
    electrical signals, they acted as coordinated pumps, producing rhythmic waves
    that appeared to flush cerebrospinal fluid through brain tissue, washing out waste.
    After the researchers silenced certain areas of the brain to stop the waves, cerebrospinal
    fluid lost the ability to flow, leaving detritus in place.
