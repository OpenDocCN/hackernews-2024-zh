- en: 'Giovanni Della Casa (1503–1556) was a Florentine humanist and cleric, born
    into mercantile wealth with aristocratic origins. After a libertine youth in which
    he penned obscene poems, he leveraged family connections, which trumped his shaky
    religious convictions, and found himself appointed Archbishop of Benevento. Initially
    angling after a cardinalate, the change of papal regime led Della Casa to take
    retirement, [living](https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/93158081.pdf) “in tranquility,
    rest, and idleness amongst my books”. Here he set about composing, among other
    texts, what we now would call an etiquette manual, addressed to a young nobleman.
    Written between 1552 and 1555, *Il Galateo* was completed just a year before his
    death. In the months of his final decline, Della Casa asked a nephew to incinerate
    his compositions, but — thanks again to a network of family and friends — *Il
    Galateo* was published posthumously, seeing French, Spanish, German, and Latin
    editions circulating before the century’s turn, and dozens of others since. The
    work’s subsequent influence was so great that it inspired envy and impolite admonishments
    from other writers: Laurence Sterne in *Tristram Shandy* wonders how Della Casa
    managed to compose such a work — spending, as he did, “the greatest part of his
    time in combing his whiskers”.'
