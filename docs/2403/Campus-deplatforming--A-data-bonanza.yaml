    crisis on campus, we have to take a deep breath and count to 50 — sometimes 100\.
    We have been pummeling the public with numbers and data about shout downs, heckler’s
    vetoes, and disinvitations and deplatforming of campus speakers *for years*, and
    it can be exhausting to hear people continue to dismiss it as a non-issue.

    why. Campuses exploded in the wake of Hamas’ attack on Israel on Oct. 7, with
    attempts to deplatform speakers coming in about equal numbers from both sides.
    However, as of this moment we are not aware of a pro-Palestine event being disrupted
    by pro-Israel students. The most recent examples we have are all pro-Palestinian
    protestors shutting down pro-Israel speech.
