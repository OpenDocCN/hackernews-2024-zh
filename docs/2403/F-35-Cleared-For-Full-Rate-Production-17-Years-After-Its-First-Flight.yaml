    17 years after the aircraft first took to the air, and almost 23 years after Lockheed
    Martin won the contract for the Joint Strike Fighter. The decision to move forward,
    known as Milestone C, is hugely significant for the Joint Strike Fighter program,
    but it comes at a time in which the U.S. military is [not accepting new aircraft](https://www.twz.com/the-1000th-f-35-has-been-built),
