- en: Accenture announced today that it would acquire the [learning platform Udacity](https://newsroom.accenture.com/news/2024/accenture-to-acquire-edtech-leader-udacity-to-accelerate-capabilities-of-accenture-learnvantage)
    as part of an effort to build a learning platform focused on the growing interest
    in AI. While the company didn’t specify how much it paid for Udacity, it also
    announced a $1 billion investment in building a technology learning platform it’s
    calling LearnVantage.

    clear that it is particularly interested in offering training to get workers up
    to speed on AI. “The rise of generative AI represents one of the most transformative
    changes in how work gets done and is driving a growing need for enterprises to
    train and upskill people in cloud, data and AI as they build their digital core
    and reinvent their enterprises,” Kishore Durg, global lead of Accenture LearnVantage
    said in a statement.

- en: As for Udacity, which was founded in 2011, it gave the usual kinds of statements
    a company makes when it gets acquired by a much larger organization like Accenture.
    That is, it believes that it can reach more people and help them acquire skills
    as part of the larger entity. That goes without saying, but there had been [rumors
    earlier this year](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/startups/upgrad-in-talks-for-100-million-to-close-us-edtech-udacity-buy/articleshow/106842130.cms?from=mdr)
    that the company was in talks with Indian edtech company Upgrad with an asking
    price of $80 million. Apparently that deal fell through and Accenture ended up
    buying them instead.

- en: Regardless, if the rumored $80 million price tag was correct, that was a precipitous
    drop in value for a company that raised almost $300 million, [per PitchBook](https://my.pitchbook.com/profile/54606-61/company/profile#general-info),
    and sported a $1 billion valuation in 2015.
