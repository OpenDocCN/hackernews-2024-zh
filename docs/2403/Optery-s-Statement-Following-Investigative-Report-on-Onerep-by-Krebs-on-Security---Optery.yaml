    [investigative report](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2024/03/ceo-of-data-privacy-company-onerep-com-founded-dozens-of-people-search-firms/)
    on the personal data removal service Onerep and its CEO. The post went viral as
    it provided a large body of evidence that Onerep’s CEO is also the founder of
    the people search site Nuwber and dozens of other people search sites. Krebs on
    Security also provided evidence that while the company represents itself as Virginia-based,
    it was founded in and operates out of the country of Belarus.

    assembled the facts so rigorously. It corroborated several of the things [we had
    been pointing out about Onerep](https://www.optery.com/introducing-optery-remove-yourself-from-150-people-search-sites-like-truthfinder-mylife-radaris-socialcatfish-spokeo-whitepages/)
    since 2021, and that Will McAdam, the late founder of PrivacyDuck, pointed out
    from 2016 until his death in July 2021\. While largely unknown to the general
    public, Onerep’s affiliations with Nuwber and other people search sites were an
    open secret inside the data removal industry. Prior to the Krebs on Security post
    there had been an air of fear about the topic and a reluctance to write about
    it.

    and strikingly parallel origins of Onerep and Nuwber. McAdam’s YouTube channel
    provided videos demonstrating Onerep’s founders were based in Belarus and that
    when Onerep originally launched, it displayed consumers’ personal information
    in plain text to the public in a remarkably similar fashion to Nuwber. He documented
    that the Onerep and Nuwber websites were seemingly mirror images of themselves
    run from the same origin code base.

    is it even possible to trust a data removal company anymore? And, is it inevitable
    that data removal companies will partner with data broker sites via mafia-style
    rackets? Our answer to the first question is Yes, and to the second question is
    No.

    caused people to question the entire industry. But Onerep has always been a bit
    different. One of the big tip-offs that Onerep operated differently was that they
    openly worked with people search sites such as Nuwber and ClustrMaps as affiliate
    partners. This is something we highlighted a few times in the past as highly questionable
    (e.g., [https://imgur.com/a/juSC66b](https://imgur.com/a/juSC66b)). To use an
    analogy, how would you feel about an anti-virus software company working with
    the creators and distributors of computer viruses as affiliate partners? They’re
    just feeding the beast, or perhaps in this case, just feeding themselves.

    and cachet in privacy and security circles, chose to partner with Onerep in the
    first place. The Mozilla Monitor partnership legitimized Onerep and anointed them
    in the industry as safe. The best way to sum up the collective feeling in the
    data removal industry when the Mozilla + Onerep partnership was announced was
    “Unbelievable”.

    were aware of the past affiliations with the entities named in the article and
    were assured they had ended prior to our work together … We’re now looking into
    this further. We will always put the privacy and security of our customers first

    knowledge of the industry, we do not believe the conflicts of interest Brian Krebs
    highlighted at Onerep are widespread or endemic in the data removal industry.

    we cover is necessary. For example, sometimes the data brokers we cover request
    we format our opt out requests differently so they can process them more efficiently.
    This has resulted in collegial conversations with some of the data brokers that
    are more lean-forward on consumer data privacy rights. We welcome these conversations.
    Another example is for the opposite situation when we have to remind data brokers
    of their obligations and provide an escalation path to the authorities if they
    fail to comply. However, these coordinations are purely operational and there
    are no financial strings attached.

    Policy](https://www.optery.com/privacy-policy/), that Optery does not sell or
    rent personal information to any third parties for any purpose, Optery is not
    a data broker, Optery does not have any financial relationship with any data broker
    it covers, and that Optery is not affiliated with any data broker.
