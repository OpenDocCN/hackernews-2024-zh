- en: In the early stages of a company’s lifecycle, when its leaders reach forks in
    the road of strategy, they often consider their options in the context of competition.
    Do they want to do what competitors are doing or something different? Do they
    want to be a big fish in a small pond or a small fish in a big pond? Should they
    attempt what others have tried and failed at, or should they take the innovative
    approach?

    nearly all podcast hosting was controlled by entrenched incumbents, all of which
    charged creators for hosting, distribution, and analytics, and which had done
    little to innovate since entering the market over a decade before. Within a few
    years, [we’d overtaken all of them](https://newsroom.spotify.com/2021-12-16/2021-wrapped-for-podcasters-shows-that-more-people-are-becoming-audio-creators/?utm_source=www.zaxis.page&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=taking-on-the-monopoly),
    not only in terms of market share, but also in terms of contribution to growth
    of the overall podcast market.

    consumption happened on Apple devices and, in large part, on Apple software. But
    by 2021, when I was at Spotify, I witnessed firsthand how [Spotify overtook Apple](https://www.business-standard.com/article/economy-policy/spotify-overtakes-apple-as-top-us-podcast-platform-report-121102800603_1.html?utm_source=www.zaxis.page&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=taking-on-the-monopoly)

    years earlier.

    The audiobooks industry had long been (and in many ways still is) dominated by
    an incumbent: Audible. Within two years—just last fall—Spotify launched a [first-of-its-kind
    premium audiobooks product](https://www.zaxis.page/p/audiobooks), granting account
    owners access to 150,000 audiobooks as part of their existing premium subscriptions.
    Although I left the company shortly after that launch, I still strongly believe
    in the strategy that I’ve seen work before in podcasting. We decided to take on
    a seemingly fenced-off market and offer consumers the first, truly viable alternative
    to Audible.'

    were often skewed by their familiarity with the status quo. Their view: The incumbents

    the most upside with the least competitive risk. “What can I build that’s differentiated
    from what others are doing?”
  id: totrans-split-20
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    highest-risk area to build in, because its viability has not yet been proven.
    The cost of validating hypotheses and finding product-market fit is often astronomically
    high. In fact, the player that typically wins in these spaces is the one who comes
    *after* the first several rounds of companies making first mover mistakes (I like
    to refer to this phenomenon as [the Faux First Mover Advantage](https://www.zaxis.page/p/faux-first-mover-advantage)).
    Apple is one such company whose products are rarely first, but are often *perceived*
    as being first and—more importantly—the best.
  id: totrans-split-21

    of other hungry players and their institutional funders. We’re seeing this play
    out today in AI; we saw it several years ago in crypto; we will see it happen
    in the near future in AR/VR. The assumption that undeveloped industries stay undeveloped
    for long is a fallacy. Over time, the cost of competing drops, and the likelihood
    of being differentiated plummets.

    They could only have achieved their positions through product-market fit, and
    they can only defend their positions long-term by continually offering user value
    while operating a business with healthy financials. In other words, monopolies
    have already done the hard work of validation for you. And for that reason, they
    have de-risked the upside of taking them on. For instance, in the wake of the
    early podcast boom of 2014 (following the success of the podcast *Serial*), we
    at Anchor saw the surge of creators rushing to create in this new medium on the
    incumbent platforms, and knew precisely which user need we were serving by competing
    in that space.

    in their industry who can do more to continually offer better value to consumers.
    However, the lack of a clear competitive threat offers them little incentive to
    do so.

    counter-incentive. Monopolies rule over lucrative businesses. Embracing disruptive
    features or models might mean diverting profits or margin away from what is working
    well.
  id: totrans-split-26

- en: Consider the podcast hosting players I mentioned at the top. When Anchor began
    competing with them, we offered an array of differentiated value propositions
    to podcasters that none of those incumbents replicated. For instance, we allowed
    users to host audio files for free, with no limits to quantity or file duration.
    The others generated most of their revenue from monthly hosting subscriptions,
    so growing their user base by forgoing this revenue would cannibalize much of
    what made their businesses function. We had nothing to lose by doing so and everything
    to gain; they had little to gain and everything to lose.

    with small audiences for usage. All other mediums—from video to photos to text—had
    shifted away from making money off creators to making money *with* creators as
    they grew. It was that **No Trespassing** sign in podcasting that allowed this
    legacy paradigm to persist in audio well beyond those other mediums.
