    can''t use content from the publication to train its AI models. If you check [the
    NYT''s robots.txt page](https://www.nytimes.com/robots.txt), you can see that
    the *NYT* disallows GPTBot, the crawler that OpenAI introduced [earlier this month](https://www.theverge.com/2023/8/7/23823046/openai-data-scrape-block-ai).'

    full list by [accessing their robots.txt file](https://www.nytimes.com/robots.txt).
    There are open resources like [Dark Visitors](https://darkvisitors.com/) cropping
    up to maintain and provide lists of extractive AI crawlers.

- en: All of this marks a clear and fundamental distinction between search crawlers
    and AI crawlers. The former extracts value from open content, the latter indexes
    and directs users *to* content, enhancing discoverability and aggregating data.

- en: It is not incumbent upon news publications, blogs, social media sites or any
    other platform to cede this data to AI companies for free, nor should they. But,
    as search giants (and startups — looking at you Browser Company) lean (questionably)
    into surfacing extractive summaries rather than directing users to original, independent
    results, it makes more and more sense to block the agents they're using to crawl
    and surface those answers.

    point, mere speculation. What this does accomplish though is allow companies to
    continue to champion chat bots and image generators that remain rife with issues
    while chasing ever increasing valuations.

    What does it do to make the experience better? I'd love to know. Copilot is a
    mild improvement over traditional autocomplete. Advice on a subject is best provided
    by someone that has experience on what they're advising you on rather than a bucket
    of bits that will spit out believable-sounding text output.

    and improve the tools overall, but you have no responsibility to concede that
    point. Blocking these crawlers also assumes that you trust these companies to
    obey a long-lived, standard tool like `robots.txt` and given their argument that
    everything they can access is fair game for ingestion, it's fair to question whether
    they'll have the basic decency to do so.
