    said the decision to stop and postpone the event, which was running on Sunday,
    March 17, had been taken “due to the competitive integrity of this series being
    compromised.”

    players suddenly being given cheats like aimbots and wall hacks while matches
    were ongoing.

- en: One clip showed *Apex* pro Genburten shout“I’m getting hacked, I’m getting hacked!”
    as a wall hack revealed the location of every player in the match on his screen.
    Genburten threw his hands up in the air, exclaimed, “It’s cheating!” and left
    the game as quick as he could. “What the fuck?” he said, visibly distressed.

    after a hacker enabled an aimbot which was then detected and blocked by the game’s
    anti-cheat mechanism. “I cannot shoot, I cannot shoot,” he said.

    such a high-profile competition. In the Genburten clip, the streamer’s chat can
    be seen to read “Apex hacking global series by Destroyer2009 & R4ndom.”

- en: The Anti-Cheat Police Department — an X account that tracks cheating in games
    — identified the hack as a remote code execution (RCE) exploit that was targeting
    a vulnerability, either in the networking code of *Apex Legends* itself, or of
    the popular third-party anti-cheat software *Apex* uses, Easy Anti-Cheat.

    Police Department [posted](https://twitter.com/AntiCheatPD/status/1769532511057584576).
    “It is unsure whether it comes from the game or the actual anti-cheat. I would
    advise against playing any games protected by [Easy Anti-Cheat] or any EA titles
    [until] they have fixed this or can comment.”

    cheats on players’ machines, they could do much worse. “They have the capabilities
    to do whatever, like installing ransomware software locking up your entire PC,”
    they said. They [advised affected players](https://twitter.com/AntiCheatPD/status/1769537265850581136)
    to protect their personal information, change passwords, and perform a fresh operating
    system installation on their PCs.

    at fault. “At this time — we are confident that there is no RCE vulnerability
    within EAC being exploited,” [they posted on X](https://twitter.com/teddyeac/status/1769725032047972566).
