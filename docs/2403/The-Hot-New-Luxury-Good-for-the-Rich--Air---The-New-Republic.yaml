- en: Luxury markets have developed in other parts of the world with poor air quality,
    too. For *Wired,* Akanksha Singh [described](https://www.wired.com/story/breathing-is-a-luxury-in-indias-air-crisis/)
    the “pay-to-breathe” economy in India, where air-filtered spaces are accessible
    only to affluent people. In China, the sociocultural anthropologist Victoria Nguyen
    [reported](https://estsjournal.org/index.php/ests/article/view/437), underground
    bomb shelters have been converted into communal breathing areas, while wealthier
    Chinese can afford to go on “lung wash” vacations. For many others, on bad-air
    days, activities that used to take place in parks—playing cards, exercising, reading
    the paper—now take place below ground.

    was king. Outside air, and lots of it, could prevent the spread of airborne viruses.
    During a wildfire, the opposite is true: Outside air is noxious, and ventilation
    is less important than maintaining a seal and cleaning the air you’ve got inside.'

- en: 'This is what makes the technology in these high-end buildings, objectively
    speaking, so impressive: the ability to bring in, filter, and clean outside air,
    while also sealing off the outside world when needed. The seal is tough for leaky,
    drafty older buildings, especially those that date from the turn of the century:
    better for pandemics, but bad for smoke and pollution. During the 1970s, a global
    energy crisis prompted architects and engineers to create more airtight construction
    out of plastic, pressed wood, and vinyl rather than wood or stone. The new designs
    decreased ventilation, so unless such buildings can filter the air that’s brought
    in, the air quality suffers. This makes truly clean indoor air a complicated,
    and expensive, dance: You need the ability to toggle between outside and inside
    air, seal off individual apartments, and still provide high levels of filtration
    and—if desired—disinfectant technologies, such as UV light. Usually, building
    a 50-story condo would cost $800 to $900 a square foot, Roe said. The Charlotte
    cost around $1,200 a square foot.'
