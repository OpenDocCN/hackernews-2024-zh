    as Scottish law from an early date enabled the purchase of parts of buildings,
    a notable difference with south of the border. The tenement became *the* urban
    housing form in Scotland, with similar facades hiding both grand middle-class
    apartments and overcrowded working-class rooms; there was much less distinction
    of housing by appearance. (As late as 1966, some 8 percent of all dwellings in
    England & Wales had been originally designed to share a common building; in Scotland

    and suburbs with houses sprang up from the 18th century onwards. Many of these
    were developed on the great landed estates, such as Grosvenor and Bedford, which

    aimed to prevent individual benefactors from selling land, to ensure the estate
    could be passed on to subsequent generations intact. This meant development proceeded

    of time, after which the ownership would revert to the estate.

    types combined with varying degrees of overcrowding may explain why later reformers
    were so obsessed with reducing density. (There is one exception to the terraced
    rule: in the North East, perhaps due to the proximity to Scotland, the ‘Tyneside
    flat’ and its variants emerged – effectively two apartments on top of each other

    High land values may have been the overriding factor. The first ‘mansion block’
    was built in 1853 on Victoria Street, which had been newly laid out west of the
    Houses of Parliament, partly to clear the notorious Devil’s Acre slum that fell
    under the morning shadow of the Houses of Parliament and Westminster Cathedral.

    as an aspirational British housing type, setting the scene for the inter-war boom.
    But it was short lived. There were hardly any more flats built between the turn
    of the century and the mid-1930s. The traditional source of investment in urban
    housing, the private landlord, had been kneecapped by the introduction and maintenance
    of wartime rent controls. The combination of high inflation and a sharp economic
    downturn after the First World War – and attempts to maintain the gold standard

    blocks and then local authority dwellings. Meanwhile, transportation improvements
    such as motorised buses and electrified trains pulled demand away from urban settings.

    a good investment for private builders. Materials became much cheaper over the

    house fell from around £510 in 1925-6 to £361 in 1934 – a fall of 29 percent.

    sheer scale of housing development in the home counties was raising some questions:
    buyers and developers were beginning to feel that the market might be saturated
    and on the verge of a crash. Builders’ pooling approach to mortgages, which reduced
    the need for a deposit from 25 percent to 5 percent of purchase price, was coming
    under scrutiny. In the early days of this system, builders would deposit 20 percent
    of the purchase price of each house with the building society; later, their bank
    would deposit an equivalent amount with the building society using the land value
    as security. The problem was that this practice was pushing up land prices (compared
    to if customers had required a 25 percent deposit) and the valuation was in any
    case provided by the builder. It would lead to scandals by the end of the decade.

    built in London. Originally an upmarket block which was home to the likes of Terence
    Rattigan and Max Miller, by the 1970s the building had begun to visibly decay
    while a number of court cases were fought between leaseholds, freeholders and
    landlords – a frequent problem in many 1930s blocks across the country. These
    problems were gradually resolved and it has since been refurbished by Terence
    Conran’s architectural practice.'

- en: Brighton & Hove was the one place outside Central London where Victorian mansion
    blocks had been developed, and unsurprisingly there are plenty of inter-war flats
    here too, with a notable cluster in the Victorian avenues west of Palmeira Square
    in Hove. Developments sprang up in other south coast resorts, such as Worthing,
    Bournemouth and St Leonard’s-on-Sea. The latter contains one of the most remarkable
    of these buildings, Marine Court, designed to look like an Ocean Liner; it still
    stands rather incongruously amid the regency buildings laid out by James and Decimus
    Burton, who incidentally also built much of Bloomsbury and Regent’s Park. (This
    area is one of the most fascinating places in Britain to visit at the moment,
    both architecturally and socially; it’s a case study in ongoing gentrification,
    as hipsters, artists and increasingly the more affluent colonise a once-genteel
    enclave that had fallen on much harder times. Marine Court itself is in the midst
    of refurbishment).

    outside London, resulting in the 74-flat Queens Court in Clifton, Bristol and
    a collection in Jesmond and Gosforth in Newcastle-upon-Tyne: Osborne, Eskdale,
    Granville and Moor Courts. The single largest cluster, however, emerged in then-affluent
    Birmingham (which was also the most significant regional focus of the 1930s suburban
    housing boom). The earliest one, Calthorpe Mansions near Five Ways, was built
    earlier than most London blocks, in 1931; this was followed by the landscaped,
    multi-building Viceroy Court on the Bristol Road. Further west, on Hagley Road,
    Kenilworth Court, Norfolk Court, Moorland Court, Melville Hall and Westfield Hall
    are all in walking distance of each other, just outside the boundary of the Calthorpe
    Estate. There are a few others elsewhere in the city too, notably Pitmaston Court
    in Moseley, as well as lower-rise examples scattered around leafy outer suburbs
    such as Hall Green and Handsworth Wood. Bafflingly, despite their prominence,
    the Edgbaston set is not mentioned in any of the more prominent architectural
    guides, which prefer to focus on the stucco Regency and gothic Victoriana they
    are surrounded by.'

- en: Construction ended abruptly with the outbreak of war. When peace returned, the
    establishment of the planning system, building licences, and a 100 percent tax
    on betterment – land value increases due to securing planning permission – meant
    there was almost no private construction until the 1950s. This situation was exacerbated
    by the return of tight wartime rent controls. The planning ethos of that decade,
    which emphasised reducing London’s density and ‘decanting’ to new towns, had little
    room for blocks of private apartments. Meanwhile, with parts of the city wrecked
    by aerial bombing and subject to intensive policies of slum clearance, urban living
    looked squalid and was a no-go area for private investors . The widespread construction
    of council-built flats in many areas – sometimes of poor quality – re-established
    and reinforced the negative connotations surrounding the form.

  zh: 随着战争的爆发，建筑工程突然结束。和平返回后，规划体系的建立、建筑许可证和土地增值的100%税收（由于获得规划许可而导致的土地价值增长）意味着直到1950年代几乎没有私人建筑。这种情况加剧了紧张的战时租金控制的回归。那个十年的规划理念强调减少伦敦的密度和“搬迁”到新城镇，对私人公寓楼几乎没有空间。与此同时，由于部分城市遭受空袭破坏，并实施密集的清除贫民窟政策，城市生活显得肮脏不堪，成为私人投资者不愿涉足的领域。在许多地区广泛建造的市政公寓——有时质量较差——重新确立和强化了与这种形式相关的负面联想。
- en: There was nevertheless a limited return to small-scale apartment building in
    the 1950s in certain more prestigious locations, but this time the units were
    for leasehold sale. As let properties were valued according to the rental yield
    – suppressed as it was by rent controls – while empty properties were assessed
    according to market value, boosted by the tax breaks given to owner-occupiers,
    operating a rental business made no sense and there were strong incentives to
    sell. As younger affluent people began moving back into parts of Inner London
    from the late (‘swinging’) 1960s onwards – especially during the subsequent ‘Barber
    Boom’ caused by cheap money policies during the Heath government – demand for
    owner-occupied inner city accommodation increased, further pushing up prices.

    and pension funds sell out of their residential holdings and move wholesale into
    offices, which were being built at a tremendous rate in Central London in particular.
    Due to a loophole in the planning system most office construction did not need
    planning permission until 1963\. Many of the 1930s private blocks of flats were
    broken up and sold leasehold; others were bought by local councils and used as
    social housing, while some were demolished and replaced with offices. (Incidentally,
    this means that the estimate of circa 56,000 flats in London, from a survey of
    those that were still privately held in the 1970s, is almost certainly a significant
    understatement of the original numbers).

    derelict industrial land such as Montevetro in Battersea, the building of apartments
    to hold as investments has only become a feature again over the past decade or
    so. However, planning rules still mean that suburban intensification is impossible
    in most of our cities. Ironically, this means the trend has been most notable
    in the formerly industrial centre of Manchester, a city that was historically
    among the most resistant politically and culturally to flats.

    of the suburban London landscape, standing seven or eight storeys amid rather
    more low-rise environments; others are a more modest four or so storeys. Although
    they rarely exist in the same concentrations as the earlier mansion blocks, which
    can define whole areas of inner West London, there are actually somewhat more
    of them across the city as a whole. It is remarkable how little they have been
    commented on or discussed in books and academia – although to be fair they have
    been paid a little more attention than their completely ignored provincial counterparts.
    Indeed, it seems like the number of these flats outside London has never been
    counted at all. Perhaps they just did not fit in to the narratives authors and
    researchers had in their heads, providing neither the grand social housing projects
    or the privately built house-and-garden that appeal in different ways to specialists
    in this area.

    popular today because traditional suburban development is so squeezed. This history
    shows that even in the 1930s, when suburban houses were widely available, cheap
    and came with tax advantages for homeownership, many rejected his lifestyle and
    still wanted to live in flats in the city and the inner suburbs. And while families
    were not the typical tenants, the census data shows they were present, if not
    in large numbers. Indeed, the original blocks still have a lot of appeal. After
    broaching this topic on social media, I had quite a few messages from people of
    all ages who had lived in them and found them ideally suited to modern life, far
    more than anywhere else they had experienced.

    want to live and work in our cities – numerically far greater than in the 1930s,
    given demographic changes, the concentration of jobs in city centres and the greater
    appeal of an urban lifestyle (not least the fact that smog is no longer a problem).
    The comparative lack of inner-city density in British cities is also a major issue,
    constraining their commuter catchments and reducing both availaible public transport
    and their productivity. These flats seem like ideal historic examples of how to
    densify our cities while providing exactly the sort of accommodation that many
    smaller, busy households want and need: gentle, human-scale density with access

    legislative and cultural change, it would be virtually impossible – at scale –
    to demolish old, overly large homes in affluent parts of London and replace them
    with flats of six to eight storeys; planning rules and local opposition would
    almost certainly prevent it. Attempts to allow moderate intensification in suburban
    Croydon have been [scrapped after resident backlash](https://www.ft.com/content/de34dfc7-c506-4a81-b63d-41d994efaa89).
    As a result politicians at all levels seem wary of supporting the new building
    of accommodation in the private rented sector too wholeheartedly, even though
    it has the potential to deliver a large number of additional homes. Leasehold
    purchases remain unattractive for many. However where development is politically
    possible, there is a strong demand for, and incentive to build, desirable mid-rise
    apartments.

    developed at scale. The puzzle is how these benign political conditions can be
    extended out into the relatively empty inner cities elsewhere outside London,
    as well as in those central and suburban areas of the capital which are incongruously
    sparse and low-rise, despite extremely high land values. Planning reform arguments
    tend to focus on the green belt and rural nimbyism, but the debate about how to
    recreate a very different type of 1930s boom should be just as important.
