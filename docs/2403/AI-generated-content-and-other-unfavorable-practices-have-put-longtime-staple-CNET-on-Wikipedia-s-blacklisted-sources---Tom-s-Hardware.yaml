- en: In the wave of AI controversies and lawsuits, CNET has been publicly admonished
    since it first started posting thinly-veiled AI-generated content on its site
    in late 2022— a scandal that has culminated in the site being demoted from Trusted
    to Untrusted Sources on Wikipedia [h/t [Futurism](https://futurism.com/wikipedia-cnet-unreliable-ai)].

- en: Considering that CNET has been in the business since 1994 and maintained a top-tier
    reputation on Wikipedia up until late 2020, this change came after lots of debate
    between Wikipedia's editors and has drawn the attention of many in the media,
    including some CNET staff members.

- en: It's important to remember that while Wikipedia is "The Free Encyclopedia that
    Anyone Can Edit," it's hardly The Wild West. Wikipedia's community of editors
    and volunteers demand citations for any information added to Wiki pages, which
    keeps some degree of accountability behind the massive community responsible for
    operating Wikipedia. While it should never be used as a primary source, Wikipedia
    tends to be at least an excellent place to start researching those topics due
    to those citation requirements.

- en: CNET's (apparent) fall on Wikipedia started before its AI-generated content
    was discovered. Back in October 2020, the acquirement of CNET by publisher Red
    Ventures began pushing CNET down at Wikipedia since evidence seemed to indicate
    a drop in editorial standards and more advertiser-favored content.

- en: But following November 2023, when Red Ventures began posting AI-generated content
    to what used to be one of the most reputable tech sites, Wikipedia editors nearly
    immediately started pushing to demote CNET entirely from [Wikipedia's list of
    reliable sources](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Reliable_sources/Perennial_sources).
    CNET claims to have stopped posting AI-generated content since the nature of Red
    Ventures' ruthless pursuit of capital and posting of misinformation on other owned
    sites (like Healthline) has kept CNET off the current list of reliable sources.

- en: One Wikipedia editor, Chess, was quoted in the Futurism piece as saying, "We
    shouldn't repeatedly put the onus on editors to prove that Red Ventures ruined
    a site before we can start removing it; they can easily buy or start another.
    I think we should look at the common denominator here, which is Red Ventures,
    and target the problem (a spam network) at its source."

    here isn't purely the concealed usage of generative AI in published articles on
    one of the most well-known tech news sites ever. Instead, it's the fact that those
    AI-generated articles tend to be poorly written and inaccurate.

    content in the form of spambots and malicious actors. In this way, editors'' treatment
    of AI-generated content is remarkably consistent with their past policy: it is
    just spam, isn''t it?'

    on Twitter. This may have gone undiscovered had the person responsible not openly
    boasted about the "achievement," which involved looking at a competitor's site,
    running it all through AI, and immediately *AI generating an entire competing
    website with 1800 articles* targeting the same niche to "steal 3.6M total traffic
    from a competitor".

    a site run by Excel expert David Bruns to help others better use Excel. Besides
    having his hard work stolen in perhaps the sleaziest, laziest manner possible,
    Bruns also discovered that most of that content was inaccurate. [Hubspot's coverage](https://hubspot.sjv.io/c/221109/976131/12893?subId1=tomshardware-us-1381976808239222212&sharedId=tomshardware-us&u=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fai%2Fseo-heist)

    of a usable Internet with content written by humans capable of testing and genuinely
    understanding things. One can only hope stories like this help discourage publishers
    from tossing aside quality control to the point where they're auto-generating
    misleading content.

    remind us that these so-called generative AIs are pretty much required to steal
    other people's work to function at all. At least when a regular thief steals an
    object, it still works. With generative AI, you can't even guarantee that the
    result will be accurate, especially if you already lack the expertise to tell
    the difference.
