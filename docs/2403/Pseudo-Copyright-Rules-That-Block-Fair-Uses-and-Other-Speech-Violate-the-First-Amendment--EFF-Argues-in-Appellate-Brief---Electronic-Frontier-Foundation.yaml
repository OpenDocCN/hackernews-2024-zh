- en: WASHINGTON, DC—A 1998 federal law that criminalizes access to digital works
    for lawful purposes—chilling free expression and impeding scientific research—is
    unenforceable because it’s too broad and violates the First Amendment, the Electronic
    Frontier Foundation (EFF) and co-counsel Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati argued
    in [an appeals court brief filed today](https://www.eff.org/document/green-v-doj-opening-brief-11-29-2023).

- en: The brief, filed in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit
    in the case of *Green v. Department of Justice*, argued Section 1201(a) of the
    Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) is constitutionally invalid on its face.
    The case arises after 25 years of people having to petition the Copyright Office
    for permission to exercise their fair use and other rights in copyrighted works
    that have been put under digital locks.

    from digital works, including works they already own or embedded in physical objects
    they own,” the brief argued. “It has also burdened their rights to create their
    own protected expression, whether that expression includes fair-use copying of
    portions of others’ works, or reflects the uncopyrightable facts and ideas in
    those works.”

    behalf of security researcher Matthew Green and technologist Andrew “bunnie” Huang,
    both of whom pursue projects that benefit the public and are perfectly lawful
    except for DMCA’s anti-speech provisions, which block their ability to develop
    and publish their work based upon fair use and other copyright exemptions.

- en: The appeals court [issued a narrow ruling](https://www.eff.org/document/green-dc-circuit-opinion)
    in December 2022 on whether the First Amendment protected the plaintiffs’ rights
    to publish code that included instructions for circumventing encryption in order
    to read and build upon lawfully-acquired software and video. But no court has
    yet considered whether the law overall creates an unconstitutional speech-licensing
    regime, nor considered the 25 years of accumulated evidence that the law—passed
    in 1998 before the web became as ubiquitous as it is now—is overbroad because
    its impact falls predominantly on legitimate and important speech.

- en: Section 1201’s anti-circumvention and anti-trafficking provisions make it illegal
    for people to access even lawfully-purchased copyrighted material such as films,
    songs, and the computer code that controls vehicles, devices, and appliances,
    whenever such access requires bypassing encryption or another access-control technology.
    Enacted out of a belief that it was necessary to combat copyright infringement,
    this ban applies even where people want to make non-infringing fair uses of such
    materials or engage in speech that has nothing to do with copyright. Since infringers
    already face steep civil and criminal penalties, the primary impact of this law
    has been to stifle lawful speech.

    copyright infringement. But instead of narrowing the provision, it created a process
    that required people wishing to exercise their rights to petition the Librarian
    of Congress for an exemption—a process accessible only once every three years.
    EFF argues that this provision is also unconstitutional, since it allows the Copyright
    Office to decide that some completely legal speech is still not allowed.

- en: “This supposed ‘safety valve’ is not only onerous, slow, and biased, it is an
    unconstitutional speech-licensing regime,” the brief argued. “And because it lacks
    clear, definite standards and the procedural safeguards required by the First
    Amendment, it has generated rules that improperly discriminate against certain
    types of expression and certain speakers.”

    Hopkins Information Security Institute, studies the security of computer systems
    and teaches others how to do the same; his work requires finding weaknesses in
    code, which requires that he read the code in question. Huang, a prominent computer
    scientist and inventor, and his company Alphamax LLC, are developing devices for
    editing and analyzing digital video streams that would let people make innovative,
    real-time uses of their paid video content, such as automatically identifying
    video subjects, improving accessibility, or captioning a presidential debate with
    a running comment field from social media—all of which are easy to do if you are
    able to read the video data into a computer but impossible to do at the same quality
    otherwise.
