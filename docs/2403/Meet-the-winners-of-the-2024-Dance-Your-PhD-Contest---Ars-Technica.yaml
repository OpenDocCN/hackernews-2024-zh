    delighting in the [many creative approaches](https://arstechnica.com/science/2021/03/meet-this-years-winners-of-the-dance-your-phd-contest/)
    researchers have devised to adapt their doctoral theses into movement—from "nano-sponge"
    materials and superconductivity to the physics of atmospheric molecular clusters
    and the science of COVID-19\. This year''s winner is Weliton Menário Costa of
    the Australian National University for [his thesis](https://www.proquest.com/openview/2871aa9065618f58f0ce056272c8cac1/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&cbl=2026366&diss=y)
    "Personality, Social Environment, and Maternal-level Effects: Insights from a
    Wild Kangaroo Population." His video entry, "Kangaroo Time," is having a bit of
    a viral moment, charming viewers with its catchy beat and colorful, quirky mix
    of dance styles and personalities—both human and kangaroo.'

- en: As [we reported previously](https://arstechnica.com/science/2019/02/dance-your-phds-2018-winner-mixes-superconductivity-and-swing-dancing/),
    the [Dance Your PhD](https://www.science.org/content/page/announcing-annual-dance-your-ph-d-contest)
    contest was established in 2008 by science journalist John Bohannon. It was previously
    sponsored by Science magazine and the American Association for the Advancement
    of Science (AAAS) and is now sponsored by the AI company Primer, where Bohannon
    is the director of science. Bohannon [told Slate in 2011](https://slate.com/technology/2011/10/dance-your-ph-d-winners-of-the-annual-interpretive-dance-contest-for-scientists-videos.html)
    that he came up with the idea while trying to figure out how to get a group of
    stressed-out PhD students in the middle of defending their theses to let off a
    little steam. So he put together a dance party at Austria's [Institute of Molecular
    Biotechnology](https://www.imba.oeaw.ac.at), including a contest for whichever
    candidate could best explain their thesis topics with interpretive dance.

    the next would be—and Dance Your PhD has continued ever since. It''s now in its
    16th year. There are four broad categories: physics, chemistry, biology, and social
    science, with a fairly liberal interpretation of what topics fall under each.
    All category winners receive $750, while Costa, as the overall champion, will
    receive an additional $2,000.'

- en: 'A native of Brazil, Costa earned a PhD in ecology from ANU in 2021 after spending
    several years studying eastern gray kangaroos, using a remote-controlled car to
    determine their distinct personalities. For example, some were bold and would
    approach the car out of curiosity; others were shyer and would avoid the car.
    Among his chief findings: Kangaroos like to socialize in groups but prefer smaller
    social circles. Kangaroo personalities emerge early, just like in humans, with
    mothers, offspring, and siblings often having similar personalities. But their
    personalities are also somewhat flexible; kangaroos will adjust their behavior
    based on social cues from the kangaroos around them.'

- en: 'When it came time to translate his research into movement, Costa decided to
    represent the rich diversity of kangaroo behavior with an equally diverse collection
    of dancers and dance styles: classical ballet, Brazilian funk, and urban styles,
    to name a few. Everyone was free to improvise their moves, with the only instruction
    being to mingle with others and slowly unify as a group. Costa joined in, adapting
    his dance style throughout to match other dancers, thus mimicking how kangaroos
    adapt their personalities to fit into a group. There''s even a behind-the-scenes
    video, which you can watch [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2U76WCw3dhw).'

    one of the content judges, [told Science](https://www.science.org/content/article/kangaroo-research-wins-dance-phd-contest)
    about why they selected Costa''s entry. "You could tell they were having fun through
    the process, that it wasn''t this labored, stressful experience."'

- en: Costa is the first ANU researcher to win the contest and only the fourth Australian.
    "I think it not only shows the incredible might of the research conducted here
    in Australia but also how creative we are as a nation. Even us scientists," [Costa
    said](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-02-28/act-weli-anu-academic-dance-your-phd-kangaroo-time-socialisation/103519188)
    of his win. "One of the main messages I wanted to convey through this piece of
    work is that differences lead to diversity, and this is evident throughout the
    entire video. It's evident with the different dancers that herald from various
    cultures and backgrounds." Costa is pursuing music as "Dr. WELI," and "Kangaroo
    Time" is one of four songs on his debut EP, *Yours Academically, Dr. WELI*. But
    he'll still be working at ANU as a visiting fellow until early 2025.
