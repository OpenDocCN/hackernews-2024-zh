  zh: 多年来，我们一直关注年度Dance Your PhD比赛，喜欢研究人员如何将博士论文巧妙地转化为动作，从“纳米海绵”材料和超导体到大气分子团簇物理和COVID-19科学。今年的赢家是澳大利亚国立大学的Weliton
    Menário Costa，他的博士论文《个性、社会环境和母级效应：来自野生袋鼠群体的见解》。他的视频作品《袋鼠时光》因其引人注目的节奏和丰富多彩、古怪的舞蹈风格和个性（无论是人类还是袋鼠），正经历一段病毒式传播的时刻，迷倒了观众。
- en: As [we reported previously](https://arstechnica.com/science/2019/02/dance-your-phds-2018-winner-mixes-superconductivity-and-swing-dancing/),
    the [Dance Your PhD](https://www.science.org/content/page/announcing-annual-dance-your-ph-d-contest)
    contest was established in 2008 by science journalist John Bohannon. It was previously
    sponsored by Science magazine and the American Association for the Advancement
    of Science (AAAS) and is now sponsored by the AI company Primer, where Bohannon
    is the director of science. Bohannon [told Slate in 2011](https://slate.com/technology/2011/10/dance-your-ph-d-winners-of-the-annual-interpretive-dance-contest-for-scientists-videos.html)
    that he came up with the idea while trying to figure out how to get a group of
    stressed-out PhD students in the middle of defending their theses to let off a
    little steam. So he put together a dance party at Austria's [Institute of Molecular
    Biotechnology](https://www.imba.oeaw.ac.at), including a contest for whichever
    candidate could best explain their thesis topics with interpretive dance.

    Your PhD](https://www.science.org/content/page/announcing-annual-dance-your-ph-d-contest)比赛由科学记者约翰·博汉农（John
    Bohannon）于2008年创立。此前由《Science》杂志和美国科学促进会（AAAS）赞助，现由AI公司Primer赞助，博汉农是该公司的科学主管。博汉农在2011年告诉[Slate](https://slate.com/technology/2011/10/dance-your-ph-d-winners-of-the-annual-interpretive-dance-contest-for-scientists-videos.html)时说，他想出这个主意是为了让一群正在答辩期间的焦虑博士生们放松一下。因此，他在奥地利的分子生物技术研究所举办了一个舞会，包括一个由解释性舞蹈来最佳表达他们论文主题的竞赛。
- en: 'The contest was such a hit that Bohannon started getting emails asking when
    the next would be—and Dance Your PhD has continued ever since. It''s now in its
    16th year. There are four broad categories: physics, chemistry, biology, and social
    science, with a fairly liberal interpretation of what topics fall under each.
    All category winners receive $750, while Costa, as the overall champion, will
    receive an additional $2,000.'

  zh: 这次比赛非常成功，以至于Bohannon开始收到询问下一次比赛何时举行的电子邮件——从那时起，"Dance Your PhD"比赛一直持续至今。现在已经是第16年了。比赛有四个广泛的类别：物理学、化学、生物学和社会科学，对于哪些主题属于哪个类别有着相对宽松的解释。所有类别的获奖者都将获得750美元，而作为总冠军的科斯塔将额外获得2000美元。
- en: 'A native of Brazil, Costa earned a PhD in ecology from ANU in 2021 after spending
    several years studying eastern gray kangaroos, using a remote-controlled car to
    determine their distinct personalities. For example, some were bold and would
    approach the car out of curiosity; others were shyer and would avoid the car.
    Among his chief findings: Kangaroos like to socialize in groups but prefer smaller
    social circles. Kangaroo personalities emerge early, just like in humans, with
    mothers, offspring, and siblings often having similar personalities. But their
    personalities are also somewhat flexible; kangaroos will adjust their behavior
    based on social cues from the kangaroos around them.'

  zh: 巴西人科斯塔在2018年从ANU获得生态学博士学位，经过数年研究东灰袋鼠，使用遥控汽车确定它们独特的个性。例如，一些灰袋鼠大胆好奇，会接近汽车；而另一些则更胆小，会避开汽车。他的主要发现之一是：袋鼠喜欢群体社交，但更偏爱较小的社交圈。袋鼠的个性早早就显现出来，就像人类一样，母亲、后代和兄弟姐妹通常有相似的个性。但它们的个性也具有一定的灵活性；袋鼠会根据周围袋鼠的社交信号调整行为。
- en: 'When it came time to translate his research into movement, Costa decided to
    represent the rich diversity of kangaroo behavior with an equally diverse collection
    of dancers and dance styles: classical ballet, Brazilian funk, and urban styles,
    to name a few. Everyone was free to improvise their moves, with the only instruction
    being to mingle with others and slowly unify as a group. Costa joined in, adapting
    his dance style throughout to match other dancers, thus mimicking how kangaroos
    adapt their personalities to fit into a group. There''s even a behind-the-scenes
    video, which you can watch [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2U76WCw3dhw).'

- en: Costa is the first ANU researcher to win the contest and only the fourth Australian.
    "I think it not only shows the incredible might of the research conducted here
    in Australia but also how creative we are as a nation. Even us scientists," [Costa
    said](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-02-28/act-weli-anu-academic-dance-your-phd-kangaroo-time-socialisation/103519188)
    of his win. "One of the main messages I wanted to convey through this piece of
    work is that differences lead to diversity, and this is evident throughout the
    entire video. It's evident with the different dancers that herald from various
    cultures and backgrounds." Costa is pursuing music as "Dr. WELI," and "Kangaroo
    Time" is one of four songs on his debut EP, *Yours Academically, Dr. WELI*. But
    he'll still be working at ANU as a visiting fellow until early 2025.

    科斯塔在他的获奖感言中说道。"我通过这件作品想要传达的主要信息之一是，差异导致多样性，这在整个视频中都是显而易见的。这显而易见，从来自各种文化和背景的不同舞者身上。"
    科斯塔正在以"Dr. WELI"的身份追求音乐，而"Kangaroo Time"是他处女EP《Yours Academically, Dr. WELI》中的四首歌曲之一。但他仍将继续作为ANU的访问研究员工作，直至2025年初。
