    We’ve long had policies and automated systems to fight against spammers, and we
    work to address emerging tactics that look to game our results with low-quality
    content. We regularly update those policies and systems to effectively tackle
    these trends so we can continue delivering useful content and connecting people
    with high-quality websites.

- en: In 2022, we began [tuning our ranking systems](https://blog.google/products/search/more-content-by-people-for-people-in-search/)
    to reduce unhelpful, unoriginal content on Search and keep it at very low levels.
    We're bringing what we learned from that work into the March 2024 core update.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This update involves refining some of our core ranking systems to help us better
    understand if webpages are unhelpful, have a poor user experience or feel like
    they were created for search engines instead of people. This could include sites
    created primarily to match very specific search queries.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We believe these updates will reduce the amount of low-quality content on Search
    and send more traffic to helpful and high-quality sites. Based on our evaluations,
    we expect that the combination of this update and our previous efforts will collectively
    reduce low-quality, unoriginal content in search results by 40%.

    to our spam policies to better address new and evolving abusive practices that
    lead to unoriginal, low-quality content showing up on Search. We’ll take action
    on more types of these manipulative behaviors starting today. While our ranking
    systems keep many types of low-quality content from ranking highly on Search,
    these updates allow us to take more [targeted action](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/9044175?hl=en)
    under our spam policies.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We’ve long had a policy against using automation to generate low-quality or
    unoriginal content at scale with the goal of manipulating search rankings. This
    policy was originally designed to address instances of content being generated
    at scale where it was clear that automation was involved.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Today, scaled content creation methods are more sophisticated, and whether content
    is created purely through automation isn't always as clear. To better address
    these techniques, we’re strengthening our policy to focus on this abusive behavior
    — producing content at scale to boost search ranking — whether automation, humans
    or a combination are involved. This will allow us to take action on more types
    of content with little to no value created at scale, like pages that pretend to
    have answers to popular searches but fail to deliver helpful content.

- en: Sometimes, websites that have their own great content may also host low-quality
    content provided by third parties with the goal of capitalizing on the hosting
    site's strong reputation. For example, a third party might publish payday loan
    reviews on a trusted educational website to gain ranking benefits from the site.
    Such content ranking highly on Search can confuse or mislead visitors who may
    have vastly different expectations for the content on a given website.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We’ll now consider very low-value, third-party content produced primarily for
    ranking purposes and without close oversight of a website owner to be spam. We're
    publishing this policy two months in advance of enforcement on May 5, to give
    site owners time to make any needed changes.

- en: Occasionally, expired domains are purchased and repurposed with the primary
    intention of boosting search ranking of low-quality or unoriginal content. This
    can mislead users into thinking the new content is part of the older site, which
    may not be the case. Expired domains that are purchased and repurposed with the
    intention of boosting the search ranking of low-quality content are now considered
    spam.

    be areas where we can improve. We’ll continue to work hard at keeping low-quality
    content on Search to low levels, and showing more information created to help
    people.
