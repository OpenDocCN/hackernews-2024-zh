- en: Water exiting a hydropower dam is called non-powered or powered outflow. Non-powered
    outflow exits via a spillway, on top of the dam. Powered outflow, which is used
    to generate electricity, travels through penstocks, pipes at the bottom of a dam.
    Powered outflow is usually colder and travels at a higher velocity, so it can
    disturb sediments, temperatures, and water quality of downstream rivers, especially
    when it’s a high percentage of the total outflow.

    including lakes, rivers, oceans, and reservoirs, can help scientists better analyze
    these impacts.

    of 1,350 m³/s. If SWOT measured the reservoir’s water depth (H) at 100 m above
    the penstocks, compute the velocity (m/s) of the powered outflow using V=√(2gH).**'
