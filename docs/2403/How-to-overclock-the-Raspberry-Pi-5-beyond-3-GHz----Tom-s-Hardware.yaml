    well known to be the fastest [Raspberry Pi](https://www.tomshardware.com/raspberry-pi),
    it is the new flagship after all.Originally [we managed to overclock](https://www.tomshardware.com/how-to/overclock-raspberry-pi-5)
    the Raspberry Pi 5 to 3 GHz, a great boost over the 2.4 GHz stock speed. Many
    alleged that they overclocked to much higher speeds, but we confirmed with Raspberry
    Pi that 3 GHz was the limit.

- en: Well it was, but a new [firmware](https://github.com/raspberrypi/firmware/issues/1876)
    seems to break that speed limit. Can we push the Raspberry Pi faster? We can,
    but how fast is in the hands of the [silicon gods](https://mastodon.social/@aallan/112096125218793315)
    so your mileage may vary.

- en: In our tests we managed a safe and stable overclock of 3.1 GHz. Hitting 3.2
    GHz we encountered instability issues when running a Geekbench test. Going further
    to 3.3 GHz and the system crashed more times than it worked.

    over that speed was met with failure.

- en: Before we make any overclock attempts, we need a good cooling system. At the
    very least you will need the official Raspberry Pi Active Cooler, Argon’s THRML
    Active cooler, or a passive cooler such as those from EDATEC. Do not attempt this
    process without a form of cooling as it may damage your Raspberry Pi. Tom’s Hardware
    cannot be held responsible if you break your Raspberry Pi 5.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We’ve chosen the Argon THRML 60-RC as a cooler, simply because it is $20 and
    it is a beast of a cooler. You could purchase the 52Pi water cooling kit, but
    at $120 it only provides a few degrees extra cooler for the $100 difference.

     Note, as per Raspberry Pi’s Alasdair Allan [message on Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@aallan/112096125218793315)
    this is not recommended firmware and you do so at your own risk.

    over_voltage=X for providing extra voltage to the Pi. The delta method adds voltage
    on top of the current level, here we use 50000 to add 0.05V. The older over_voltage
    method has been deprecated for the Raspberry Pi 5.
