- en: I arrived at M.I.T. in the fall of 2004\. I had just turned twenty-two, and
    was there to pursue a doctorate as part of something called the Theory of Computation
    group—a band of computer scientists who spent more time writing equations than
    code. We were housed in the brand-new Stata Center, a [Frank Gehry](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/frank-gehry-digital-defiance)-designed
    fever dream of haphazard angles and buff-shined metal, built at a cost of three
    hundred million dollars. On the sixth floor, I shared an office with two other
    students, one of many arranged around a common space partitioned by a maze of
    free-standing, two-sided whiteboards. These boards were the group’s most prized
    resource, serving for us as a telescope might for an astronomer. Professors and
    students would gather around them, passing markers back and forth, punctuating
    periods of frantic writing with unsettling quiet staring. It was common practice
    to scrawl “*DO NOT ERASE*” next to important fragments of a proof, but I never
    saw the cleaning staff touch any of the boards; perhaps they could sense our anxiety.

    a fellow incoming doctoral student who was seventeen. He had graduated summa cum
    laude at fifteen and then spent the intervening period as a software engineer
    for Microsoft before getting bored and deciding that a Ph.D. might be fun. He
    was the second most precocious person I met in those first days. Across from my
    office, on the other side of the whiteboard maze, sat a twenty-three-year-old
    professor named Erik Demaine, who had recently won a MacArthur “genius” grant
    for resolving a long-standing conjecture in computational geometry. At various
    points during my time in the group, the same row of offices that included Erik
    was also home to three different winners of the Turing Award, commonly understood
    to be the computer-science equivalent of the Nobel Prize. All of this is to say
    that, soon after my arrival, my distinct impression of M.I.T. was that it was
    preposterous—more like something a screenwriter would conjure than a place that
    actually existed.

    postdoctoral associate—before taking a professorship at Georgetown University,
    where I’ve remained happily ensconced ever since. At the same time that my academic
    career unfolded, I also became a writer of general-audience books about work,
    technology, and distraction. (My latest book, “[Slow Productivity](https://www.amazon.com/Slow-Productivity-Accomplishment-Without-Burnout/dp/0593544854),”
    was published this month.) For a long time, I saw these two endeavors as only
    loosely related. Only recently have I realized that my time at M.I.T. may be the
    source of nearly every major idea I’ve chased in my writing. At the Theory of
    Computation group, I got a glimpse of thinking in its purest form, and it changed
    my life.

    there placed on concentration, which I soon understood to be the single most important
    skill required for success in our field. In his book “[Surely You’re Joking, Mr.
    Feynman!](https://www.amazon.com/Surely-Feynman-Adventures-Curious-Character/dp/0393316041),”
    the Nobel Prize-winning physicist Richard P. Feynman recalled delivering his first
    graduate seminar at Princeton, to an audience that included Albert Einstein and
    Wolfgang Pauli: “Then the time came to give the talk, and here are these *monster
    minds* in front of me, waiting!” At M.I.T., we had our own monster minds, who
    were known for their formidable ability to focus.'

    a description of a complicated proof, stare into space for a few minutes, and
    then quip, “O.K., got it,” before telling you how to improve it. It was important
    that they didn’t master your ideas too quickly: the dreaded insult was for someone
    to respond promptly and deem your argument “trivial.” I once attended a lecture
    by a visiting cryptographer. After he finished, a *monster mind* in the audience—an
    outspoken future Turing winner—raised his hand and asked, “Yes, but isn’t this
    all, if we think about it, really just trivial?” In my memory, the visitor fought
    back tears. In the theory group, you had to focus to survive.'

    and productivity. Scientists who work in labs, and have to run experiments or
    crunch numbers, can famously work long hours. Theoreticians can’t, as there’s
    only so much time you can usefully think about math. Right before a paper deadline,
    you might push hard to get results written up. On the other hand, weeks could
    go by with little more than the occasional brainstorming session. An average day
    might require two or three hours of hard cogitation.

    As a graduate student, I was sent all around Europe to present papers at various
    conferences. The meetings themselves weren’t the point. It was the conversations
    that mattered—one good idea, sparked on a rooftop in Bologna or beside Lake Geneva
    in Lausanne, was worth days of tiring travel. But despite long periods of apparent
    lethargy, we still were productive. By the time I left M.I.T. to start my job
    at Georgetown, I had already published twenty-six peer-reviewed papers—and yet
    I’d never really felt busy.

    proudly marker-on-board thinkers, surrounded by more hands-on computer scientists
    who were actually programming and building tangible new things. They honed concrete
    inventions; by contrast, our patron saint was [Alan Turing](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/living-in-alan-turings-future),
    who’d completed his foundational work on the theory of computation before electronic
    computers were even invented. In a setting otherwise obsessed with artificial
    marvels, we developed a pro-human chauvinism. We were computer scientists, but
    we were skeptical that digital tools could be more valuable than human cognition
    and creativity.

    output wasn’t laser-focussed, the system would quietly shunt you away. (The doctoral
    program included an ambiguous requirement called the “research qualifying exam,”
    which provided a natural checkpoint at which students who weren’t producing publications
    could move on to other opportunities.) This approach makes perfect sense for an
    institution trying to train the world’s technical élite, but it can’t be easily
    exported to a standard workplace. Most organizations are not made up of a bunch
    of Erik Demaines.

    more general audiences, I’ve come to believe that these narrow extremes still
    somehow embody broad truths. Too many of us undervalue concentration, and substitute
    busyness for real productivity, and are quick to embrace whatever new techno-bauble
    shines brightest. You don’t have to spend hours staring at whiteboards or facing
    down monster minds for these realizations to ring true. M.I.T. is preposterous—but
    in its particulars it may have also isolated something that the rest of us, deep
    down, know is important.

- en: “Slow Productivity,” my newest book, is ostensibly about work. It rejects a
    notion of productivity based on activity, and instead promotes a slower alternative
    based on real value produced at a more humane pace. When I wrote it, I didn’t
    realize that I was inspired by the eccentric theoretical computer scientists with
    whom I once loafed around the Stata Center. But I was. Decades later, I still
    think they were doing something right. ♦
