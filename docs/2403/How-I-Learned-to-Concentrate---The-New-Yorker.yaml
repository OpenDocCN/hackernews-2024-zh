- en: I arrived at M.I.T. in the fall of 2004\. I had just turned twenty-two, and
    was there to pursue a doctorate as part of something called the Theory of Computation
    group—a band of computer scientists who spent more time writing equations than
    code. We were housed in the brand-new Stata Center, a [Frank Gehry](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/frank-gehry-digital-defiance)-designed
    fever dream of haphazard angles and buff-shined metal, built at a cost of three
    hundred million dollars. On the sixth floor, I shared an office with two other
    students, one of many arranged around a common space partitioned by a maze of
    free-standing, two-sided whiteboards. These boards were the group’s most prized
    resource, serving for us as a telescope might for an astronomer. Professors and
    students would gather around them, passing markers back and forth, punctuating
    periods of frantic writing with unsettling quiet staring. It was common practice
    to scrawl “*DO NOT ERASE*” next to important fragments of a proof, but I never
    saw the cleaning staff touch any of the boards; perhaps they could sense our anxiety.

  zh: 我在2004年秋天抵达麻省理工学院。我刚满二十二岁，是为了攻读博士学位而加入计算理论组的一部分——这是一个专注于写方程式而非代码的计算机科学家团体。我们驻扎在全新的斯塔塔中心，一个由[弗兰克·盖里（Frank
    Gehry）](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/frank-gehry-digital-defiance)设计的发热梦境，充满着杂乱的角度和抛光的金属，耗资三亿美元建成。在六楼，我与另外两名学生分享一间办公室，这是许多办公室之一，围绕着一个由自立式双面白板迷宫分隔的公共空间。这些白板是团队最宝贵的资源，对我们而言，就像望远镜对天文学家一样。教授和学生们会聚集在周围，来回递送记号，用不安的宁静眼神
    punctuating periods of frantic writing with unsettling quiet staring。很多时候，会在重要的证明碎片旁边涂写“*DO
    NOT ERASE*”，但我从未见过清洁人员动过这些白板；也许他们能感受到我们的焦虑。
- en: Even more striking than the space were the people. During orientation I met
    a fellow incoming doctoral student who was seventeen. He had graduated summa cum
    laude at fifteen and then spent the intervening period as a software engineer
    for Microsoft before getting bored and deciding that a Ph.D. might be fun. He
    was the second most precocious person I met in those first days. Across from my
    office, on the other side of the whiteboard maze, sat a twenty-three-year-old
    professor named Erik Demaine, who had recently won a MacArthur “genius” grant
    for resolving a long-standing conjecture in computational geometry. At various
    points during my time in the group, the same row of offices that included Erik
    was also home to three different winners of the Turing Award, commonly understood
    to be the computer-science equivalent of the Nobel Prize. All of this is to say
    that, soon after my arrival, my distinct impression of M.I.T. was that it was
    preposterous—more like something a screenwriter would conjure than a place that
    actually existed.

  zh: 即使比太空更引人注目的是人们。在迎新会上，我遇到了一个同龄的博士生，他只有十七岁。他在十五岁时以优异成绩毕业，然后在微软当软件工程师，直到觉得无聊，决定读博士学位可能会有趣。他是我在那些第一天遇到的第二个最早熟的人。在我办公室对面，白板迷宫的另一边，坐着一个名叫埃里克·德迈因（Erik
    Demaine）的二十三岁教授，他最近因解决计算几何中的一个长期猜想而获得了麦克阿瑟“天才”奖。在我在这个团队的时间里，埃里克所在的办公室同一排还住着三位不同时间的图灵奖得主，通常被认为是计算机科学界的诺贝尔奖等级。这一切都是为了说，我刚到达不久后，对麻省理工学院的鲜明印象是，这简直荒谬——更像是编剧会凭空想象的东西，而不是一个真实存在的地方。
- en: I ended up spending seven years at M.I.T.—five earning my Ph.D. and two as a
    postdoctoral associate—before taking a professorship at Georgetown University,
    where I’ve remained happily ensconced ever since. At the same time that my academic
    career unfolded, I also became a writer of general-audience books about work,
    technology, and distraction. (My latest book, “[Slow Productivity](https://www.amazon.com/Slow-Productivity-Accomplishment-Without-Burnout/dp/0593544854),”
    was published this month.) For a long time, I saw these two endeavors as only
    loosely related. Only recently have I realized that my time at M.I.T. may be the
    source of nearly every major idea I’ve chased in my writing. At the Theory of
    Computation group, I got a glimpse of thinking in its purest form, and it changed
    my life.

  zh: 我在麻省理工学院度过了七年时间——五年时间获得博士学位，两年时间作为博士后研究员——然后在乔治城大学担任教授，至今我依然很快乐地在那里。在我的学术生涯同时进行的时候，我也成为了一名撰写关于工作、技术和注意力的通俗读物的作家。（我的最新书，《[慢节奏的生产力](https://www.amazon.com/Slow-Productivity-Accomplishment-Without-Burnout/dp/0593544854)》，本月出版。）很长一段时间里，我认为这两个努力只是松散地相关。直到最近，我才意识到我在麻省理工学院的时光可能是我追求写作中几乎每一个重要思想的源头。在计算理论小组，我窥见了思维的纯粹形式，这改变了我的生活。
- en: 'A defining feature of the theory group was the explicit value that the researchers
    there placed on concentration, which I soon understood to be the single most important
    skill required for success in our field. In his book “[Surely You’re Joking, Mr.
    Feynman!](https://www.amazon.com/Surely-Feynman-Adventures-Curious-Character/dp/0393316041),”
    the Nobel Prize-winning physicist Richard P. Feynman recalled delivering his first
    graduate seminar at Princeton, to an audience that included Albert Einstein and
    Wolfgang Pauli: “Then the time came to give the talk, and here are these *monster

- en: 'I was astonished at how the most impressive of my colleagues could listen to
    a description of a complicated proof, stare into space for a few minutes, and
    then quip, “O.K., got it,” before telling you how to improve it. It was important
    that they didn’t master your ideas too quickly: the dreaded insult was for someone
    to respond promptly and deem your argument “trivial.” I once attended a lecture
    by a visiting cryptographer. After he finished, a *monster mind* in the audience—an
    outspoken future Turing winner—raised his hand and asked, “Yes, but isn’t this
    all, if we think about it, really just trivial?” In my memory, the visitor fought
    back tears. In the theory group, you had to focus to survive.'

  zh: 我对最令人印象深刻的同事之一是如何听完复杂证明的描述，凝视片刻，然后说：“好的，我明白了”，然后告诉你如何改进它，感到惊讶。他们不应该太快掌握你的想法：可怕的侮辱是有人迅速回应并认为你的论点“微不足道”。我曾参加过一位访问的密码学家的讲座。在他结束后，一位在场的*怪物般的头脑*——一个未来杜林奖得主——举手问道：“是的，但是如果我们深思熟虑，这一切不都是微不足道吗？”在我的记忆中，访客忍住了眼泪。在理论小组，你必须集中注意力才能生存。
- en: Another lesson of my M.I.T. years was the fundamental separation between busyness
    and productivity. Scientists who work in labs, and have to run experiments or
    crunch numbers, can famously work long hours. Theoreticians can’t, as there’s
    only so much time you can usefully think about math. Right before a paper deadline,
    you might push hard to get results written up. On the other hand, weeks could
    go by with little more than the occasional brainstorming session. An average day
    might require two or three hours of hard cogitation.

  zh: 我在麻省理工学院的另一个教训是繁忙和生产力之间的根本区别。在实验室工作并需要进行实验或数据分析的科学家可以出名地长时间工作。理论家则不能，因为有用于深思熟虑数学的时间是有限的。在截稿前，你可能会努力写出结果。另一方面，几个星期可能只是偶尔的头脑风暴。一个平常的日子可能需要两三个小时的深思熟虑。
- en: The idea of taking your time to find the right idea was central to my experience.
    As a graduate student, I was sent all around Europe to present papers at various
    conferences. The meetings themselves weren’t the point. It was the conversations
    that mattered—one good idea, sparked on a rooftop in Bologna or beside Lake Geneva
    in Lausanne, was worth days of tiring travel. But despite long periods of apparent
    lethargy, we still were productive. By the time I left M.I.T. to start my job
    at Georgetown, I had already published twenty-six peer-reviewed papers—and yet
    I’d never really felt busy.

    M.I.T. 开始在乔治城工作时，我已经发表了二十六篇同行评议的论文——然而，我从未真正忙碌过。
- en: Finally, there were those whiteboards. The theory group was a collection of
    proudly marker-on-board thinkers, surrounded by more hands-on computer scientists
    who were actually programming and building tangible new things. They honed concrete
    inventions; by contrast, our patron saint was [Alan Turing](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/living-in-alan-turings-future),
    who’d completed his foundational work on the theory of computation before electronic
    computers were even invented. In a setting otherwise obsessed with artificial
    marvels, we developed a pro-human chauvinism. We were computer scientists, but
    we were skeptical that digital tools could be more valuable than human cognition
    and creativity.

- en: The culture at M.I.T. was intense to the point of being exclusionary. If your
    output wasn’t laser-focussed, the system would quietly shunt you away. (The doctoral
    program included an ambiguous requirement called the “research qualifying exam,”
    which provided a natural checkpoint at which students who weren’t producing publications
    could move on to other opportunities.) This approach makes perfect sense for an
    institution trying to train the world’s technical élite, but it can’t be easily
    exported to a standard workplace. Most organizations are not made up of a bunch

- en: Still, starting from these specialized roots and then moving on to write for
    more general audiences, I’ve come to believe that these narrow extremes still
    somehow embody broad truths. Too many of us undervalue concentration, and substitute
    busyness for real productivity, and are quick to embrace whatever new techno-bauble
    shines brightest. You don’t have to spend hours staring at whiteboards or facing
    down monster minds for these realizations to ring true. M.I.T. is preposterous—but
