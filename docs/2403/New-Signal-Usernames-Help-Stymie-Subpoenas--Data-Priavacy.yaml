    that the messaging app hand over information about one of its users. Based on
    a phone number, the federal prosecutors were asking for the user’s name, address,
    correspondence, contacts, groups, and call records to assist with an FBI investigation.
    Two weeks later, the American Civil Liberties Union [responded](https://signal.org/bigbrother/cd-california-grand-jury/)
    on behalf of Signal with just two pieces of data: the date the target Signal account
    was created, and the date that it last connected to the service.'

    access to. As Signal’s website puts it, “It’s impossible to turn over data that
    we never had access to in the first place.” It wasn’t the first time Signal has
    received data requests from the government, nor was it the last. In [all cases](https://signal.org/bigbrother/),
    Signal handed over just those two pieces of data about accounts, or nothing at
    all.

    encrypted, but so is pretty much everything else. Signal doesn’t know your name
    or profile photo, who any of your contacts are, which Signal groups you’re in,
    or who you talk to and when. (This isn’t true for WhatsApp, Telegram, iMessage,
    and nearly every other messaging app.)

    When activists join Signal groups for organizing, they’ve been forced to share
    their phone number with people they don’t yet know and trust. Journalists have
    had to choose between soliciting tips by publishing their private numbers to their
    readers — and therefore inviting harassment and cyberattacks — or [setting up
    a second Signal number](https://freedom.press/training/secondary-signal-account/),
    a challenging and time-consuming prospect. Most journalists simply don’t publish
    a Signal number at all. That’s all about to change.

    Your phone number will still be displayed to contacts who already have it stored
    in their phones. Going forward, however, when you start a new conversation on
    Signal, your number won’t be shared at all: Contacts will just see the name you
    use when you set up your Signal profile. So even if your contact is using a custom
    Signal client, for example, they still won’t be able to discover your phone number

    whenever you want and delete when you don’t want it anymore. Rather than directly
    storing your username as part of your account details, Signal stores a cryptographic
    hash of your username instead; Signal uses the Ristretto 25519 hashing algorithm,
    essentially storing a random block of data instead of usernames themselves. This
    is like how online services can confirm a user’s password is valid without storing
    a copy of the actual password itself.

    a conversation with you by searching for your username, all without learning your

    it makes sense for journalists to create a username that they never change and
    publish it widely so sources can reach out to them. Journalists can now do that
    without having to share their private phone number. It makes sense for sources,
    on the other hand, to only set a username when they specifically want to connect
    with someone, then delete it afterward.

    one, without needing to change your username.

    the American Civil Liberties Union to challenge and respond to it, handing over
    as little user data as possible. Signal publishes a post to the “Government Requests”
    [section](https://signal.org/bigbrother/) of their website (signal.org/bigbrother)
    whenever they’re legally forced to provide user data to governments, so long as
    they’re allowed to. Some of the examples include challenges to gag orders, allowing
    Signal to publish the previously sealed court orders.

    related to a user with a specific username that is currently active at the time
    that Signal looks it up, they would be able to link it to an account. That means
    Signal would turn over that user’s phone number, along with the account creation
    date and the last connection date. Whittaker stressed that this is “a pretty narrow
    pipeline that is guarded viciously by ACLU lawyers,” just to obtain a phone number
    based on a username.

    be able to confirm that it was ever in use to begin with, much less which accounts
    had used it before.

    difficult, however, for law enforcement to learn the actual username itself based
    on its hash. If they already suspect a username, they could use the hash to confirm
    that it’s real. Otherwise, they would have to guess the username using password
    cracking techniques like [dictionary attacks](https://blog.1password.com/what-is-dictionary-attack/)

    the phone number requirement, and they’ll readily admit that optional usernames
    are only a partial fix. But because phone numbers make it simpler for most people

    Signal. “The existence of a handful of small apps that don’t really have a large

    it’s actually workable for a large-scale app,” Whittaker said.

    friction, including paid options, but nothing is currently on their road map.

    private messaging, and we have achieved critical mass at a pretty large scale.
    Those things couldn’t easily be recreated if we fuck this up by making a rash
    decision that then makes it a spammy ghost town. That’s the concern we’re wrestling
