- en: Andrew Lang​ was in Oxford when he first encountered the living dead. One autumn
    night in 1869, he passed John Conington, professor of Latin, staring silently
    at Corpus Christi College. Nothing odd about a distracted don, except that Lang
    soon learned that Conington had, at that moment, been breathing his last in Boston,
    Lincolnshire. Years later, he discussed this ‘real or sham J.C.’ with members
    of the Society for Psychical Research who wished to include his experience in
    a treatise called *Phantasms of the Living*. Lang’s short note, addressed from
    the Savile Club, was genially inconclusive about what he had seen. He was, he
    admitted, bad with faces, but the lamp light in Oriel Lane had given him ‘a very
    good view’ and Conington was ‘not easily mistaken … I know no one in Oxford who
    was at all like him’ – he was renowned, even in good health, for his greenish
    complexion. This was enough for the SPR. Even if it were a case of mistaken identity,
    the ‘coincidence’ of the ‘illusion’ with Conington’s death pangs remained an ‘inexpugnable
    fact’. When read alongside other records of last gasp apparitions, the case suggested
    that we could rescue something of ourselves from our perishing bodies.

- en: Supernormal experiences were a delicate question in the late 19th century, especially
    when they bore on such wobbly tenets of Christianity as immortality. Educated
    elites increasingly wished to strip religion of its supernatural excrescences
    and make it a sound pillar of society. The development of both anthropology and
    psychiatry encouraged them to explain away unearthly visions, ghosts or demons
    as relics of primitive thought or symptoms of mental illness. Yet the reductionism
    of these new disciplines was as brittle as it was ambitious, and Lang became their
    ardent critic. Like the SPR, whose president he later became, he sought evidence
    to challenge or at least stretch scientific naturalism’s pinched vision of reality.
    In a voluminous grimoire of ghost stories he published in 1897, he confessed that
    he was in a ‘balance of doubt’ about their truth. John Sloan’s new biography of
    Lang explores his attempts to frame and hold that balance. It reconstructs the
    development of a professional gadfly, who skipped across the hardening boundaries
    of literature, anthropology and history to insist on the strange origins of religion.

    the Scottish Borders explained his call to the weird. Sloan shows that it owed
    more to his frictional relationship with academic institutions. In 1864, he won
    a Snell Exhibition, which had sent many brilliant students – not least Adam Smith
    – from Glasgow University to Balliol College, Oxford. The high churchmanship of
    Oxford often unsettled the Presbyterian certainties of the Balliol Scotch; Archibald
    Campbell Tait, an exhibitioner of a previous generation, even ended up as the
    archbishop of Canterbury. As a Scottish Episcopalian, Lang had no Calvinism to
    shed, but he opposed the efforts of Oxford’s rising liberals to tidy up Christianity.
    He found Benjamin Jowett’s Hegelised Plato a poor substitute for St Paul and skipped
    Matthew Arnold’s poetry lectures because they clashed with cricket matches. All
    the same, he thrived. He won a fellowship at Merton. He translated French roundelays
    and befriended Walter Pater. It was a world in which everybody seemed to know
    everybody: Lang’s friend Charlotte Green was the wife of the philosopher T.H.
    Green and the sister of John Addington Symonds, the historian of the Renaissance.'

    fellowship to make a name for himself in the history of religion. Another friend,
    the anthropologist Edward Burnett Tylor, had convinced him that myths originated
    independently around the world in the thought processes of ‘savage’ peoples. Such
    speculations contradicted the theories of Friedrich Max Müller, the comparative
    philologist who then dominated Oxford. Müller argued that mythology originated
    in the spiritual insights of the Aryans of ancient India. Over time their grand
    words for high thoughts were distorted into the names of divine beings, which
    were further garbled as they spread across the world. Lang began to sense that
    Müller was, like George Eliot’s Casaubon, trapped in a futile search for a key
    to all mythologies. But he couldn’t say so openly, and so decided to leave Oxford,
    giving as the reason his impending marriage.

    battle to achieve financial security. Even brilliant writers, Lang observed, earned
    only a quarter of what a barrister did – a ratio it would be depressing to revisit
    today. Sloan’s terse summaries just about prevent the sheer mass of Lang’s publications
    from capsizing the biography. Volumes of verse (generally good). Novels (generally
    not good). A prose translation of Homer (durable). Lives of a Tory statesman and
    of Walter Scott’s biographer (solid). Revisionist histories of Scotland (unpopular
    in Scotland). He only dropped his pen to whack golf balls, flick fishing rods
    or browse the bookstalls by the Seine (Henry James thought that Lang was too ‘insular
    and innocent’ to appreciate Paris). But he could only afford to be interested
    in a topic for the time it took to dash off an article about it. As Oxonian contemporaries
    racked up professorships, he became an aged smatterer, his only titles honorifics.

    out of it, I might have been a great anthropologist.’ His writings on anthropology
    and religion were enriched but also chequered by his effort to stay afloat financially
    by specialising in everything. His first few books on the subject established
    him as Tylor’s bulldog. Lang argued that philological efforts to trace all myths
    back to a single fountainhead failed to work at a global scale. In Australia –
    where Lang had settler relatives who sent him boomerangs – Indigenous Australians
    who seemed to have no plausible contact with Müller’s Aryans still had gods of
    their own. Mythology evolved independently everywhere due to the universal phenomenon
    that Tylor called animism. Indigenous peoples, who had not yet formed a sharp
    distinction between sleeping and waking, explained dreams as the activity of a
    soul that could detach itself from the body. This encouraged them to ascribe souls
    to things and animals. Hierarchies gradually emerged: a republic of spirits became
    an aristocracy of gods and finally the absolute monarchy of one supreme being.'

    someone when they sneezed, which captured the notion that sneezing expelled spirits
    from the body. In 1877 Lang helped found the Folklore Society to explore such
    ‘survivals’. Its name suggests a kind of ethnonationalism, but he and his colleagues
    were seeking materials for a universal theory of religion, not the racial essence
    of their folk. In a review of W.B. Yeats he remarked that there was nothing unique
    about the beings lurking in the Celtic Twilight: ‘The great Celtic phantasmagoria
    is the world’s phantasmagoria.’ Sloan evokes the guilt that shrouded Lang’s interest
    in the primitive vestiges of the British world: his maternal grandfather had been
    a land agent for the duke of Sutherland, who ‘improved’ the Highlands by forcing
    out its uneconomic crofters. When rambling in Glen Urquhart, Lang saw ‘smoke hanging
    in the wet air’ above one of the last cottages to be burned down in an eviction.'

    H. Rider Haggard and Robert Louis Stevenson to Henry James, because their romances
    seemed to have a primitive gusto. Although Lang co-wrote a fantasy novel with
    Haggard, his most effective literary use of anthropology came in the form of *The
    Blue Fairy Book* and the other ‘coloured’ anthologies he and his wife, Nora, edited
    for Longman. These books presented fairy tales as ‘first made by men who were
    childlike for their own amusement’, in societies yet to discover writing or reason.
    Children were their ideal readers because they, too, were adept at ‘living in
    fantasy’, instinctively accepting that talking animals or invisible friends had
    a kind of reality. Although Lang has often been seen as a cheerleader for boy’s
    own stories of imperial adventure, these books owed everything to a team of women
    writers, headed by Nora, who translated and retold the tales with unseen artistry.
    Lang’s belief that all peoples resembled one another in their childhood also insulated
    him against Eurocentrism: believing that ‘black, white and yellow people are fond
    of just the same kind of adventures,’ he introduced his readers to Chinese, Japanese
    and Arabic tales.'

    ancient tales with the work of Jonathan Swift and the French fabulists, whose
    fairies and giants were merely their own inventions. Yet this was a literary not
    a scientific venture, one less interested in curating immemorial fragments than
    in showing readers what it was like to think with primeval abandon. To open *The
    Blue Fairy Book* is to plunge into beautifully austere narratives that invert
    or suspend normality. Cats and wolves speak and dwarfs traverse huge distances
    in boots that are seven leagues long. Nothing needs to be explained in a world
    where anything can be real. Bluebeard’s blue beard, which causes his future wife
    to loathe him, is simply that, not a symbol to be decoded. The illustrations,
    which embed meditative damsels in the haunted thickets of Burne-Jones and the
    sinister bestiaries of Wagner’s *Ring*, deepen the oneiric mood.

    is A.S. Byatt’s novel *The Children’s Book*, in which Olive Wellwood pays her
    rackety family’s bills by publishing stories whose ever more tangled and subterranean
    plots track, without revealing, the family’s incestuous secrets. The adults who
    make her a literary celebrity yearn for the mental freedoms of childhood. Her
    son Tom feels trapped in ‘Tom Underground’, the story written to entertain him
    as a child; after the success of its stage adaptation, he drowns himself at Dungeness.
    Lang’s tales similarly have the amoral force of nightmares: they calmly dwell
    on kinds of cruelty and violence that Victorian society repressed or exported
    to its margins. An ogre hoping to feast off children slits the throats of his
    own offspring. ‘The Jew’ who seizes a wonder-working brass ring is ‘tied to the
    tail of a savage mule loaded with nuts’ and ‘broken into as many pieces as there
    were nuts upon the mule’s back’.'

    ‘smoke and schoolmasters’ had long since frightened fairies away from England.
    Yet Lang had by this time begun to doubt that supernatural experiences were diminishing
    as modernity advanced. In the age of Lourdes (a place of pilgrimage only since
    1858), miracles were as ‘common as blackberries’. The founders of the SPR hoped
    to find convincing proof for anthropologists and other men of science that mediums
    could enter into contact with the dead. As the historical anthropologist Efram
    Sera-Shriar has written, Tylor gamely attended séances, but came away from them
    convinced that the followers of mediums were deluded in the same way ‘savages’
    were. Lang accepted his ‘barbaric parallels’ but flipped their charge. If so many
    of his educated contemporaries thought the energies of the spirit world no less
    real than electricity, then perhaps the ‘hallucinations’ of past ages were founded
    on truths, not error. They dimly captured powers that were supernormal, rather
    than supernatural, because they proceeded from an ‘X region of our nature’, which
    science had yet to investigate.

- en: Whereas historians of religion today enlist anthropologists to make sense of
    their sources, Lang invoked the ‘science of the history of religion’ to rebuke
    the anthropologists. A radical antiquarian, he insisted that the truth claims
    of historical attestations to the supernatural be sifted on their merits, not
    struck out for failing to pass modern standards of rationality. ‘Cock Lane and
    Common Sense’, the title essay of the 1894 book that announced his rebellion against
    Tylor, encapsulates his method. The Hanoverian investigators of an eerie tapping
    heard in a London house – Dr Johnson among them – satisfied themselves that the
    landlord’s daughter had faked it. Yet the scratches she made under observation
    produced different sounds to those heard by early witnesses, which resembled those
    attested in many other times and places. Could we say that a murdered woman haunted
    Cock Lane? No. But nor did the surviving evidence allow us to dismiss the happenings
    there as delusions. An address to the SPR on the ‘Voices of Jeanne d’Arc’ is another
    bravura display of Lang’s hermeneutic of non-suspicion. It was easy to assume
    that because the saints spoke to Joan, she had been hysterical, or superstitious,
    or both. But the chroniclers described Joan as cheerful and robust; she listened
    to her voices calmly. They were counsellors, not an inner compulsion.

    that term? Lang did not much care. The price he exacted for preserving the outré
    phenomena of religious history was their transference from theology to an expanded
    but recognisably scientific psychology. Sloan finds no glimmers of personal piety
    in Lang’s life. Yet whether or not he believed in the Christian God, he bridled
    at His slapdash detractors, the worst of whom was the anthropologist James George
    Frazer, a Presbyterian atheist. Although T.S. Eliot used Frazer’s *The Golden
    Bough* as a grab bag of incantations to destabilise the modern mind, its argument
    was punishingly rationalist. Before religion there had been magic, with which
    peoples protected their crops. When it failed, they transferred their faith to
    vegetable deities, whose sacrificial deaths mimicked the rhythms of the seasons.
    The resurrected Christ was just the most successful of these slain gods, the details
    of His Passion deriving from the ritual deaths of Persian and Babylonian kings,
    which the Jewish festival of Purim supposedly recalled when it marked the killing
    of the royal official Haman. Lang delighted in poking holes in Frazer’s account
    of the Crucifixion. Christ was not Haman and Calvary had nothing to do with Babylon.
    It wasn’t just Frazer’s scholarship that was shaky, Lang believed; his foundational
    assumptions were, too. Magic was not the stepmother of religion, but often its
    sibling: the witchcraft trials of the early modern era suggested that magical
    beliefs often thrive in periods of intense religious excitement.'

    did not so much anathematise as patronise him. Frazer commented after Lang’s death
    that he should have stuck to ‘pure literature’. Towards the end of his life, Lang
    succumbed to melancholy. When he saw a black cat run across his study, he dismissed
    it as ‘obviously hallucinatory’ and probably a symptom of macular degeneration,
    but couldn’t help greeting it as the old portent of doom in his family, which
    was no stranger to insanity. Shortly before his death at the age of 68 in 1912,
    he raved to Nora that they should move to America because ‘awful calamities were
    about to befall Europe.’ A few years later, soldiers were said to have seen angels
    in the sky over Flanders and civilians flocked to séances to speak to their beloved

    who for decades had tried to establish distinctions between sane and insane beliefs.
    In *Troubled by Faith*, Owen Davies considers their ambitious attempts to eliminate
    religious claims to supernatural experience by pathologising them. ‘Psychiatrists’
    is a pardonable anachronism for professionals who were generally called asylum
    physicians. Their intellectual confidence reflected the steady rise in the number
    of asylums, which housed a hundred thousand patients in Britain by the turn of
    the 20th century. Davies makes a convincing, though limited, case for the significance
    of asylums to debates about religion and the supernatural. They were never the
    total institutions imagined by Foucault, the outcrops of a vast discursive shift
    in the policing of minds. It was difficult to end up in an asylum, unless your
    relatives agreed to do the paperwork to send you there. A majority of those who
    were committed stayed for less than a year and were rarely subjected to ambitious
    therapies. A consistently small proportion of inmates were classed as insane on
    religious grounds, much lower than those admitted for alcoholism. Yet British
    psychiatrists still had a big enough caseload to write voluminously on religious
    insanity.

    taxonomy of pathologies to challenge the jurisdiction of the Church over cases
    of demonic possession. Jean-Étienne Esquirol’s concept of religious monomania,
    which explained the way beliefs gripped otherwise healthy victims, became the
    basis for many boutique diagnoses. Think you’re the messiah? It’s a nasty case
    of theomania. Put your faith in spiritualist mediums? You’ve succumbed to mediomania
    or spiritualistic madness. So great was the proliferation of such conditions that
    by the late 19th century international psychiatric conferences dedicated themselves
    to reducing their number. There were also shifts in fashion: monomania began to
    disappear as Charcot’s theory of ‘hysteria’ established itself as a totalising
    explanation for everything from hallucinations to demonic possession.'

    talk of spirits or witches made them mad, another to get lawyers to accept it.
    From the bench, judges sneered at ‘experts in madness’. Even a display of the
    wildest of beliefs would not necessarily help a criminal defendant dodge the 1843
    M’Naghten rules, which cleared him only if he did not ‘know the nature and quality
    of the act he was doing; or if he did know it, that he did not know he was doing
    what was wrong’. The effort to make certain beliefs symptomatic of insanity also
    foundered during the contestation of wills. Many lawyers urged that a testator’s
    belief in witchcraft or mediums did not make them so irrational that they could
    not dispose of their property. Great minds once believed in witches, while the
    growing popularity of séances suggested that a belief in spiritualism was mistaken

    than the living. Davies talks of a ‘golden age of retrospective diagnoses’, which
    involved patients as various as Socrates, Jesus and John Wesley. The early modern
    witchcraft trials were a popular hunting ground. A belief in sorcery had once
    seemed a hallmark of ignorance; now it became a pathology. Psychiatrists wondered
    if witches should have been sent to the asylum, not the stake. It was perhaps
    harder to medicalise their persecutors. Could demonomania grip an entire society?
    Some psychiatrists argued weakly that witch-hunters suffered from an ‘insane opinion’,
    without being ‘individually insane’. Although the interest in viewing such phenomena
    as mass possession or religious revivals as expressions of bespoke pathologies
    faded over time, Davies neatly shows that psychoanalysts would in turn collapse
    the past with the present. Freud read demonological treatises as guides not to
    madness but neurosis: they charted movements of hysteria and sexual repression
    as ordinary as their discussion by early modern believers had been lurid.'

    psychiatrists with the voices of their patients, who speak to us faintly through

    sources reveal complex connections between religious belief and insanity. A denomination’s
    dogmas might generate certain varieties of supernatural experience. The acrid
    sectarianism of Presbyterianism explains one man’s faith that he was ‘elected
    to destroy all those who did not belong to the established Church of Scotland’.
    But madness was an ecumenical matter. All denominations saw angels. A Jewish Mancunian
    believed that the freemasons were stealing his semen, a Belfast Presbyterian that
    spiritualists had forced his semen up into his neck. Mad talk also shows us how
    ineffectual were efforts by churches to discipline the religious imagination of
    the people with Bibles and catechisms. Inmates tailored scripture to their compulsions
    with a magic literalism, as in the case of Margaret Joynt, a young woman who said
    she had the Star of Bethlehem in her eye. Then again, the hermeneutics of many
    churches were no less weird: Joynt belonged to the Catholic Apostolic Church,
    whose founders claimed to have the gift of speaking in tongues. It was the context
    rather than the content of Joynt’s speech that made her claim a question of mental
    health rather than theology: shortly after her release from the asylum, she killed

    tubes or telephones were conduits for the telepathic malevolence of demons or
    Jesuits. Theologians mimicked rationality in their defence of faith against it.
    The inmates Davies discusses did no less – the doctor of a man who said he had
    put Satan in a bottle admitted he ‘argues tolerably well upon his absurd premises’.
    It was easier for the mad, as for the religious, to describe the coherence of
    their system than to convince others of its correspondence with reality. One inmate
