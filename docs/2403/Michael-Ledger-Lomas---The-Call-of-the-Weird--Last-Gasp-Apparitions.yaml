- en: Andrew Lang​ was in Oxford when he first encountered the living dead. One autumn
    night in 1869, he passed John Conington, professor of Latin, staring silently
    at Corpus Christi College. Nothing odd about a distracted don, except that Lang
    soon learned that Conington had, at that moment, been breathing his last in Boston,
    Lincolnshire. Years later, he discussed this ‘real or sham J.C.’ with members
    of the Society for Psychical Research who wished to include his experience in
    a treatise called *Phantasms of the Living*. Lang’s short note, addressed from
    the Savile Club, was genially inconclusive about what he had seen. He was, he
    admitted, bad with faces, but the lamp light in Oriel Lane had given him ‘a very
    good view’ and Conington was ‘not easily mistaken … I know no one in Oxford who
    was at all like him’ – he was renowned, even in good health, for his greenish
    complexion. This was enough for the SPR. Even if it were a case of mistaken identity,
    the ‘coincidence’ of the ‘illusion’ with Conington’s death pangs remained an ‘inexpugnable
    fact’. When read alongside other records of last gasp apparitions, the case suggested
    that we could rescue something of ourselves from our perishing bodies.

- en: Supernormal experiences were a delicate question in the late 19th century, especially
    when they bore on such wobbly tenets of Christianity as immortality. Educated
    elites increasingly wished to strip religion of its supernatural excrescences
    and make it a sound pillar of society. The development of both anthropology and
    psychiatry encouraged them to explain away unearthly visions, ghosts or demons
    as relics of primitive thought or symptoms of mental illness. Yet the reductionism
    of these new disciplines was as brittle as it was ambitious, and Lang became their
    ardent critic. Like the SPR, whose president he later became, he sought evidence
    to challenge or at least stretch scientific naturalism’s pinched vision of reality.
    In a voluminous grimoire of ghost stories he published in 1897, he confessed that
    he was in a ‘balance of doubt’ about their truth. John Sloan’s new biography of
    Lang explores his attempts to frame and hold that balance. It reconstructs the
    development of a professional gadfly, who skipped across the hardening boundaries
    of literature, anthropology and history to insist on the strange origins of religion.

    the Scottish Borders explained his call to the weird. Sloan shows that it owed
    more to his frictional relationship with academic institutions. In 1864, he won
    a Snell Exhibition, which had sent many brilliant students – not least Adam Smith
    – from Glasgow University to Balliol College, Oxford. The high churchmanship of
    Oxford often unsettled the Presbyterian certainties of the Balliol Scotch; Archibald
    Campbell Tait, an exhibitioner of a previous generation, even ended up as the
    archbishop of Canterbury. As a Scottish Episcopalian, Lang had no Calvinism to
    shed, but he opposed the efforts of Oxford’s rising liberals to tidy up Christianity.
    He found Benjamin Jowett’s Hegelised Plato a poor substitute for St Paul and skipped
    Matthew Arnold’s poetry lectures because they clashed with cricket matches. All
    the same, he thrived. He won a fellowship at Merton. He translated French roundelays
    and befriended Walter Pater. It was a world in which everybody seemed to know
    everybody: Lang’s friend Charlotte Green was the wife of the philosopher T.H.
    Green and the sister of John Addington Symonds, the historian of the Renaissance.'

- en: But his social successes hid intellectual frustrations. Lang wanted to use his
    fellowship to make a name for himself in the history of religion. Another friend,
    the anthropologist Edward Burnett Tylor, had convinced him that myths originated
    independently around the world in the thought processes of ‘savage’ peoples. Such
    speculations contradicted the theories of Friedrich Max Müller, the comparative
    philologist who then dominated Oxford. Müller argued that mythology originated
    in the spiritual insights of the Aryans of ancient India. Over time their grand
    words for high thoughts were distorted into the names of divine beings, which
    were further garbled as they spread across the world. Lang began to sense that
    Müller was, like George Eliot’s Casaubon, trapped in a futile search for a key
    to all mythologies. But he couldn’t say so openly, and so decided to leave Oxford,
    giving as the reason his impending marriage.

    battle to achieve financial security. Even brilliant writers, Lang observed, earned
    only a quarter of what a barrister did – a ratio it would be depressing to revisit
    today. Sloan’s terse summaries just about prevent the sheer mass of Lang’s publications
    from capsizing the biography. Volumes of verse (generally good). Novels (generally
    not good). A prose translation of Homer (durable). Lives of a Tory statesman and
    of Walter Scott’s biographer (solid). Revisionist histories of Scotland (unpopular
    in Scotland). He only dropped his pen to whack golf balls, flick fishing rods
    or browse the bookstalls by the Seine (Henry James thought that Lang was too ‘insular
    and innocent’ to appreciate Paris). But he could only afford to be interested
    in a topic for the time it took to dash off an article about it. As Oxonian contemporaries
    racked up professorships, he became an aged smatterer, his only titles honorifics.

    back to a single fountainhead failed to work at a global scale. In Australia –
    where Lang had settler relatives who sent him boomerangs – Indigenous Australians
    who seemed to have no plausible contact with Müller’s Aryans still had gods of
    their own. Mythology evolved independently everywhere due to the universal phenomenon
    that Tylor called animism. Indigenous peoples, who had not yet formed a sharp
    distinction between sleeping and waking, explained dreams as the activity of a
    soul that could detach itself from the body. This encouraged them to ascribe souls
    to things and animals. Hierarchies gradually emerged: a republic of spirits became

    were seeking materials for a universal theory of religion, not the racial essence
    of their folk. In a review of W.B. Yeats he remarked that there was nothing unique
    about the beings lurking in the Celtic Twilight: ‘The great Celtic phantasmagoria
    is the world’s phantasmagoria.’ Sloan evokes the guilt that shrouded Lang’s interest
    in the primitive vestiges of the British world: his maternal grandfather had been
    a land agent for the duke of Sutherland, who ‘improved’ the Highlands by forcing
    out its uneconomic crofters. When rambling in Glen Urquhart, Lang saw ‘smoke hanging

    H. Rider Haggard and Robert Louis Stevenson to Henry James, because their romances
    seemed to have a primitive gusto. Although Lang co-wrote a fantasy novel with
    Haggard, his most effective literary use of anthropology came in the form of *The
    Blue Fairy Book* and the other ‘coloured’ anthologies he and his wife, Nora, edited
    for Longman. These books presented fairy tales as ‘first made by men who were
    childlike for their own amusement’, in societies yet to discover writing or reason.
    Children were their ideal readers because they, too, were adept at ‘living in
    fantasy’, instinctively accepting that talking animals or invisible friends had
    a kind of reality. Although Lang has often been seen as a cheerleader for boy’s
    own stories of imperial adventure, these books owed everything to a team of women
    writers, headed by Nora, who translated and retold the tales with unseen artistry.
    Lang’s belief that all peoples resembled one another in their childhood also insulated
    him against Eurocentrism: believing that ‘black, white and yellow people are fond

    Yet Lang had by this time begun to doubt that supernatural experiences were diminishing
    as modernity advanced. In the age of Lourdes (a place of pilgrimage only since
    1858), miracles were as ‘common as blackberries’. The founders of the SPR hoped
    to find convincing proof for anthropologists and other men of science that mediums
    could enter into contact with the dead. As the historical anthropologist Efram
    Sera-Shriar has written, Tylor gamely attended séances, but came away from them
    convinced that the followers of mediums were deluded in the same way ‘savages’
    were. Lang accepted his ‘barbaric parallels’ but flipped their charge. If so many
    of his educated contemporaries thought the energies of the spirit world no less
    real than electricity, then perhaps the ‘hallucinations’ of past ages were founded
    on truths, not error. They dimly captured powers that were supernormal, rather
    than supernatural, because they proceeded from an ‘X region of our nature’, which

- en: Whereas historians of religion today enlist anthropologists to make sense of
    their sources, Lang invoked the ‘science of the history of religion’ to rebuke
    the anthropologists. A radical antiquarian, he insisted that the truth claims
    of historical attestations to the supernatural be sifted on their merits, not
    struck out for failing to pass modern standards of rationality. ‘Cock Lane and
    Common Sense’, the title essay of the 1894 book that announced his rebellion against
    Tylor, encapsulates his method. The Hanoverian investigators of an eerie tapping
    heard in a London house – Dr Johnson among them – satisfied themselves that the
    landlord’s daughter had faked it. Yet the scratches she made under observation
    produced different sounds to those heard by early witnesses, which resembled those
    attested in many other times and places. Could we say that a murdered woman haunted
    Cock Lane? No. But nor did the surviving evidence allow us to dismiss the happenings
    there as delusions. An address to the SPR on the ‘Voices of Jeanne d’Arc’ is another
    bravura display of Lang’s hermeneutic of non-suspicion. It was easy to assume
    that because the saints spoke to Joan, she had been hysterical, or superstitious,
    or both. But the chroniclers described Joan as cheerful and robust; she listened
    to her voices calmly. They were counsellors, not an inner compulsion.

- en: 'Had Joan heard from the saints as she – or John Henry Newman – would have understood
    that term? Lang did not much care. The price he exacted for preserving the outré
    phenomena of religious history was their transference from theology to an expanded
    but recognisably scientific psychology. Sloan finds no glimmers of personal piety
    in Lang’s life. Yet whether or not he believed in the Christian God, he bridled
    at His slapdash detractors, the worst of whom was the anthropologist James George
    Frazer, a Presbyterian atheist. Although T.S. Eliot used Frazer’s *The Golden
    Bough* as a grab bag of incantations to destabilise the modern mind, its argument
    was punishingly rationalist. Before religion there had been magic, with which
    peoples protected their crops. When it failed, they transferred their faith to
    vegetable deities, whose sacrificial deaths mimicked the rhythms of the seasons.
    The resurrected Christ was just the most successful of these slain gods, the details
    of His Passion deriving from the ritual deaths of Persian and Babylonian kings,
    which the Jewish festival of Purim supposedly recalled when it marked the killing
    of the royal official Haman. Lang delighted in poking holes in Frazer’s account
    of the Crucifixion. Christ was not Haman and Calvary had nothing to do with Babylon.
    It wasn’t just Frazer’s scholarship that was shaky, Lang believed; his foundational
    assumptions were, too. Magic was not the stepmother of religion, but often its
    sibling: the witchcraft trials of the early modern era suggested that magical
    beliefs often thrive in periods of intense religious excitement.'

- en: Popular enthusiasm​ for the angels of Mons came as a reverse for the psychiatrists
    who for decades had tried to establish distinctions between sane and insane beliefs.
    In *Troubled by Faith*, Owen Davies considers their ambitious attempts to eliminate
    religious claims to supernatural experience by pathologising them. ‘Psychiatrists’
    is a pardonable anachronism for professionals who were generally called asylum
    physicians. Their intellectual confidence reflected the steady rise in the number
    of asylums, which housed a hundred thousand patients in Britain by the turn of
    the 20th century. Davies makes a convincing, though limited, case for the significance
    of asylums to debates about religion and the supernatural. They were never the
    total institutions imagined by Foucault, the outcrops of a vast discursive shift
    in the policing of minds. It was difficult to end up in an asylum, unless your
    relatives agreed to do the paperwork to send you there. A majority of those who
    were committed stayed for less than a year and were rarely subjected to ambitious
    therapies. A consistently small proportion of inmates were classed as insane on
    religious grounds, much lower than those admitted for alcoholism. Yet British

  zh: 大众对门斯天使的热情反哺了几十年来试图区分正常和疯狂信念的精神病学家。在《信仰困扰》中，欧文·戴维斯考虑了他们试图通过病态化来消除宗教对超自然体验的主张的雄心勃勃的尝试。“精神病学家”这个词用在此是可以原谅的，因为这些专业人士通常被称为精神病院的医师。他们的智力自信反映了精神病院数量稳步增长的趋势，到20世纪初，英国已有十万名病人住院。戴维斯有力地但有限地论证了精神病院对宗教和超自然争论的重要性。它们从未像福柯想象的那样是完全的机构，而是广泛讨论中精神管理的表现。要进入精神病院是很困难的，除非你的亲戚同意填写相关手续送你去那里。绝大多数被送进去的人住院时间不到一年，很少接受雄心勃勃的治疗。被归类为因宗教原因疯狂的病人比因酗酒被收治的要少得多，但英国的精神病学家们仍然有足够多的病例可以大量撰写关于宗教疯狂的文章。

    taxonomy of pathologies to challenge the jurisdiction of the Church over cases
    of demonic possession. Jean-Étienne Esquirol’s concept of religious monomania,
    which explained the way beliefs gripped otherwise healthy victims, became the
    basis for many boutique diagnoses. Think you’re the messiah? It’s a nasty case
    of theomania. Put your faith in spiritualist mediums? You’ve succumbed to mediomania
    or spiritualistic madness. So great was the proliferation of such conditions that
    by the late 19th century international psychiatric conferences dedicated themselves
    to reducing their number. There were also shifts in fashion: monomania began to
    disappear as Charcot’s theory of ‘hysteria’ established itself as a totalising
    explanation for everything from hallucinations to demonic possession.'

  zh: 他们在反教会的法国理论家的大力支持下，他们开发了一套病理分类学，以挑战教会在恶魔附身案件中的管辖权。让·艾蒂安·埃斯奎罗尔关于宗教偏执狂的概念解释了信仰如何控制那些本来健康的受害者，成为许多精品诊断的基础。你觉得自己是弥赛亚？那是一种严重的神狂症。相信灵媒？你已经陷入了媒人狂或灵媒狂。这些病症的繁殖如此之大，以至于到了19世纪末，国际精神病学会议致力于减少它们的数量。时尚也有所变化：单一狂症开始消失，因为夏尔科的“癔症”理论成为一种全面解释，用来解释从幻觉到恶魔附身的一切现象。
- en: It was one thing to develop a theoretical understanding of how and why people’s
    talk of spirits or witches made them mad, another to get lawyers to accept it.
    From the bench, judges sneered at ‘experts in madness’. Even a display of the
    wildest of beliefs would not necessarily help a criminal defendant dodge the 1843
    M’Naghten rules, which cleared him only if he did not ‘know the nature and quality
    of the act he was doing; or if he did know it, that he did not know he was doing
    what was wrong’. The effort to make certain beliefs symptomatic of insanity also
    foundered during the contestation of wills. Many lawyers urged that a testator’s
    belief in witchcraft or mediums did not make them so irrational that they could
    not dispose of their property. Great minds once believed in witches, while the
    growing popularity of séances suggested that a belief in spiritualism was mistaken
    but still reasonable.

  zh: 理解人们如何以及为何谈论灵魂或女巫使他们发疯的理论理解一回事，让律师接受它则是另一回事。法官们在法庭上嘲笑‘疯狂专家’。即使展示最狂野的信仰也不一定能帮助刑事被告逃脱1843年的M’Naghten规则，这些规则只会为清白者辩护，即如果他‘不知道他正在做的行为的性质和质量；或者如果他知道，他不知道自己在做错误的事情’。试图将某些信仰视为疯狂的症状也在争夺遗嘱时破产了。许多律师主张，遗嘱者对巫术或灵媒的信仰并没有使他们变得如此非理性，以至于不能处置他们的财产。伟大的头脑曾经相信女巫，而降灵术的日益流行表明，信仰灵性主义是错误的，但仍然是合理的。
- en: 'No wonder many psychiatrists preferred to apply their science to the dead rather
    than the living. Davies talks of a ‘golden age of retrospective diagnoses’, which
    involved patients as various as Socrates, Jesus and John Wesley. The early modern
    witchcraft trials were a popular hunting ground. A belief in sorcery had once
    seemed a hallmark of ignorance; now it became a pathology. Psychiatrists wondered
    if witches should have been sent to the asylum, not the stake. It was perhaps
    harder to medicalise their persecutors. Could demonomania grip an entire society?
    Some psychiatrists argued weakly that witch-hunters suffered from an ‘insane opinion’,
    without being ‘individually insane’. Although the interest in viewing such phenomena
    as mass possession or religious revivals as expressions of bespoke pathologies
    faded over time, Davies neatly shows that psychoanalysts would in turn collapse
    the past with the present. Freud read demonological treatises as guides not to
    madness but neurosis: they charted movements of hysteria and sexual repression
    as ordinary as their discussion by early modern believers had been lurid.'

  zh: 许多精神科医生更愿意将他们的科学应用于死者而不是活者，难怪如此。戴维斯谈到了一个‘回顾性诊断的黄金时代’，其中包括苏格拉底、耶稣和约翰·卫斯理等各种病人。早期的现代巫术审判是一个流行的狩猎场。对巫术的信仰曾经似乎是无知的标志；现在它成了一种病理。精神科医生们想知道是否应该把女巫送进精神病院，而不是火刑柱。也许更难的是将他们的迫害者医学化。魔鬼狂热能控制整个社会吗？一些精神科医生含糊地认为猎巫者患有‘疯狂的观点’，而不是‘个体上的疯狂’。尽管随着时间的推移，将此类现象视为群体占有或宗教复兴表达的专属病理的兴趣逐渐消退，但戴维斯巧妙地表明，精神分析家们反过来将过去与现在混为一谈。弗洛伊德读魔鬼学论文不是作为疯狂的指南，而是作为神经症的指南：它们描述了癫痫病和性压抑的运动，早期现代信徒的讨论曾如此骇人听闻。
- en: 'The second half of Davies’s book contrasts the strident reductionism of the
    psychiatrists with the voices of their patients, who speak to us faintly through
    asylum records but with powerful directness in their surviving letters. These
    sources reveal complex connections between religious belief and insanity. A denomination’s
    dogmas might generate certain varieties of supernatural experience. The acrid
    sectarianism of Presbyterianism explains one man’s faith that he was ‘elected
    to destroy all those who did not belong to the established Church of Scotland’.
    But madness was an ecumenical matter. All denominations saw angels. A Jewish Mancunian
    believed that the freemasons were stealing his semen, a Belfast Presbyterian that
    spiritualists had forced his semen up into his neck. Mad talk also shows us how
    ineffectual were efforts by churches to discipline the religious imagination of
    the people with Bibles and catechisms. Inmates tailored scripture to their compulsions
    with a magic literalism, as in the case of Margaret Joynt, a young woman who said
    she had the Star of Bethlehem in her eye. Then again, the hermeneutics of many
    churches were no less weird: Joynt belonged to the Catholic Apostolic Church,
    whose founders claimed to have the gift of speaking in tongues. It was the context
    rather than the content of Joynt’s speech that made her claim a question of mental
    health rather than theology: shortly after her release from the asylum, she killed
    herself by drinking carbolic acid.'

  zh: 戴维斯书的后半部分对照了精神病医生的严格简化主义与他们病人的声音，这些声音通过疯人院档案中微弱地传达给我们，但在他们幸存的信件中则直截了当地表达出来。这些来源揭示了宗教信仰与精神错乱之间复杂的联系。一个教派的教条可能会引发某种超自然经历。长老会的尖刻派别主义解释了一个人的信仰，认为他是“选中了摧毁所有不属于苏格兰国教的人”。但疯狂是一个普遍的问题。所有教派都看到天使。一个曼彻斯特的犹太人相信共济会正在偷他的精子，一个贝尔法斯特的长老会成员认为通灵者将他的精子压到了他的脖子里。疯话还向我们展示了各种教会试图通过圣经和教义纠正人们宗教想象力的无效努力。病人用魔法般的字面解释定制经文，就像玛格丽特·乔伊特的案例，一个年轻女子声称她的眼里有伯利恒之星。然而，许多教会的解经学同样古怪：乔伊特属于天主教使徒教会，其创始人声称拥有说方言的恩赐。乔伊特言论的背景而非内容使她的主张成为精神健康问题而非神学问题：从疯人院释放后不久，她用碳酸喝毒自杀。
- en: It wasn’t a belief in the supernatural that marked someone out as insane, but
    the judgment of the authorities that this belief was held with harmful vehemence.
    One inmate who proclaimed himself to be Jesus was actually committed for striking
    a cab horse with an axe. Doctors wouldn’t call you mad if you saw the ghost of
    a loved one, but they might if, over time, the ghost kept saying the wrong thing
    or refused to disappear. A vision could also become a pathological hallucination
    if it happened in the wrong place. Mary Lavery, who saw the Virgin Mary outside
    a Manchester railway station in 1892, ended up in Prestwich asylum – but in ultramontane
    France, she might have emulated Bernadette Soubirous and become a saint.

  zh: 并非相信超自然现象使人标记为疯狂，而是当局判断这种信仰具有有害的强烈性时。一个病人自称是耶稣，实际上是因为用斧头打了一匹出租马而被送进了疯人院。如果你看到了亲人的幽灵，医生不会说你疯了，但如果随着时间推移，幽灵说了些错误的话或者不肯消失，他们可能会这么认为。如果在错误的地方发生了幻觉，它也可能变成病理性幻觉。1892年，玛丽·拉弗里在曼彻斯特一个火车站外看到圣母玛利亚，最终被送进了普雷斯特威奇疯人院——但在极权主义的法国，她可能会效仿贝尔纳黛特·苏比鲁成为一位圣人。
- en: 'Religion and madness developed parallel responses to the psychic stresses of
    modernity. Churches metabolised the technological innovation of capitalist society,
    turning railroads and telegraphs into instruments of evangelisation or metaphors
    for spirituality. Asylum inmates were equally resourceful, explaining that hydraulic
    tubes or telephones were conduits for the telepathic malevolence of demons or
    Jesuits. Theologians mimicked rationality in their defence of faith against it.
    The inmates Davies discusses did no less – the doctor of a man who said he had
    put Satan in a bottle admitted he ‘argues tolerably well upon his absurd premises’.
    It was easier for the mad, as for the religious, to describe the coherence of
    their system than to convince others of its correspondence with reality. One inmate
    ended his letter explaining how demons abuse electricity with the plea: ‘don’t
    imagine I am insane because I write this from a lunatic asylum.’'

  zh: 宗教和疯狂是对现代心理压力的平行响应。教会将资本主义社会的技术创新转化为福音化的工具，将铁路和电报转化为福音传播的工具或灵性的隐喻。疯人院的病人同样充满创意，解释说水力管道或电话是恶魔或耶稣会的念力恶意的传导通道。戴维斯讨论的神学家们在捍卫信仰免遭理性主义攻击时也在模仿理性。戴维斯讨论的那些病人也不例外——一位说他把撒旦装在瓶子里的病人的医生承认，“他在其荒谬的前提上也能说得相当有理。”对于疯狂者和信徒而言，描述其系统的连贯性比说服他人其与现实的符合性更容易。一位病人在信中结尾解释恶魔如何滥用电力时哀求道：“请不要因为我从疯人院写这封信就认为我疯了。”
