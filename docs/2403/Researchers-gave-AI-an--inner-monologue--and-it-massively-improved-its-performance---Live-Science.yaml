- en: Giving artificial intelligence (AI) systems an "inner monologue" makes them
    considerably better at reasoning, new research shows.

- en: The method trains AI systems to think before they respond to prompts, just as
    many people consider what we should say next before we speak. This is different
    from the way scientists have trained mainstay AI chatbots, like ChatGPT, which
    don't "think" about what they write or anticipate different possibilities for
    the next steps in a conversation.

- en: Dubbed "Quiet-STaR," the new method instructs an AI system to generate many
    inner rationales in parallel before responding to a conversational prompt. When
    the AI answers prompts, it generates a mixture of these predictions with and without
    a rationale, printing the best answer — which can be verified by a human participant
    depending on the nature of the question.

    the training method gives AI agents the capacity to anticipate future conversations
    and learn from ongoing ones.

- en: The researchers applied the Quiet-STaR algorithm to Mistral 7B, an open-source
    large language model (LLM), and posted the results March 14 to the pre-print database
    [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.09629.pdf). (The paper has not yet been peer-reviewed.)

- en: The Quiet-STaR-trained version of Mistral 7B scored 47.2% on a reasoning test
    versus 36.3% before any training. It still flunked a school math test, earning
    a score of 10.9%. But that was nearly double the starting score of 5.9% in the
    vanilla version.

    of machine learning algorithms arranged in a way that mimics the structure and
    learning patterns of the [human brain](https://www.livescience.com/29365-human-brain.html).
    However, systems built using this architecture are abysmal at common sense reasoning
    or contextualization — and AI chatbots do not have genuine "understanding."

    for their work, is one example of such a training algorithm — but is held back

  zh: 研究人员使用的自学推理算法（STaR），作为他们工作的基础之一，就是这种训练算法的一个例子 — 但受到这些限制的制约。
- en: The scientists who developed Quiet-STaR named it that because the principles
    of STaR can be applied quietly in the background and generally over several different
    types of LLM, independent of the original training data. Now they want to investigate
    how techniques like theirs can reduce the gap between neural network-based AI
    systems and human-like reasoning capabilities.

  zh: 开发Quiet-STaR的科学家们将其命名为这样是因为STaR的原则可以在背景中悄悄应用，并且通常可以在多种不同类型的LLM上独立于原始训练数据。现在，他们希望调查像他们这样的技术如何缩小基于神经网络的人工智能系统与类人推理能力之间的差距。
