- en: At Sugar Labs, we make a collection of tools that learners use to explore, discover,
    create, and reflect. We are non-profit and led by volunteers. We distribute these
    tools freely and encourage our users to appropriate them, taking ownership and
    responsibility for their learning. Sugar Labs, a volunteer-driven, non-profit
    organization, had its origins in the One Laptop per Child project. The mission
    of Sugar Labs is to support the Sugar community of users and developers and establish
    regional, autonomous “Sugar Labs” around the world to help learners “learn how
    to learn” by tailoring Sugar to local languages and curricula.
