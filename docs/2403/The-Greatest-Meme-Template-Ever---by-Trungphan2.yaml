    Project ‚ÄúTitanic‚Äù ‚Äî was because the Watch was just completed and engineers were
    ‚Äúrestless‚Äù looking for the next challenge. Apple was targeting a $100k price point
    but the car never made much sense: Apple had no unique vehicle design advantage.'

    only car (eg Waymo). Apple briefly spoke to Elon about buying Tesla (~$40B market
    cap at the time while Apple had a $155B cash pile). But obviously nothing materialized
    and now the 2000-person team is being disbanded with some employees joining Apple‚Äôs
    generative AI effort.

    is exploring ‚Äúdynamic pricing‚Äù. The media reported it as ‚ÄúUber-style price surges‚Äù.
    What the company apparently meant was that it was creating digital displays so
    that it could adjust prices (but on deals and discounts). Either way, Senator
    Elizabeth Warren said it was price gouging and the internet meme‚Äôd ‚ÄúWendy‚Äôs Price
    Surging‚Äù so hard that the fast food chain backtracked and won''t do any dynamic
    pricing.'

    of course they should have announced it as an off-peak discount then when they
    need to raise prices, blame it on inflation (notice how no one gets upset at stores
    for doing ‚Äúclearance sales‚Äù seemingly at least 50% of the time).'

    into the potential price savings during off hours. Either way, I would eat a combo
    of a Spicy Chicken Burger, Baked Potato and Junior Bacon Cheeseburger at any price
    point between $10 to $300\.

    to create an open-source AI lab to counter Google‚Äôs internal AI project (because
    he was alarmed by Larry Page‚Äôs position that it was OK if an AI superintelligence
    superseded human intelligence). He teamed up with Sam Altman to found OpenAI in
    2015\. Fast-forward to 2024 and OpenAI is a de-facto ‚Äúclosed and for-profit subsidiary
    of Microsoft‚Äù according to a [lawsuit that Elon filed (the full 44-page PDF reads
