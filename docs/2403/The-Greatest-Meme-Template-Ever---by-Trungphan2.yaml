    2015\. Fast-forward to 2024 and OpenAI is a de-facto ‚Äúclosed and for-profit subsidiary
    of Microsoft‚Äù according to a [lawsuit that Elon filed (the full 44-page PDF reads

    tech per the founding documents. Between this lawsuit and a separate SEC lawsuit
    around OpenAI‚Äôs communications with investors, it seems likely that OpenAI‚Äôs ‚Äúfor-profit
    tucked inside a non-profit‚Äù corporate structure won‚Äôt hold.

    called House of Illuminati organized a Willy Wonka event at a warehouse in Glasgow,
    Scotland. The group used generative AI to make photos of an ‚Äúimmersive‚Äù Willy
    Wonka building but the actual venue was basically empty. [Photos (and memes) from
    the event can only be described as ‚Ä¶ demented](https://www.indy100.com/viral/willy-wonka-experience-glasgow-memes-2667395376).'

    one, now! The major *Dune 2* meme so far has to do with a special popcorn bucket
    designed as a massive sand worm from the film. Many internet commentators pointed
    out that it looks like a Fleshlight.

    asked about the bucket, director Denis Villeneuve said, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to make
    stupid jokes right now that I will regret tomorrow morning. But I will say this.
    When I saw it, I went, ‚Äò*Hoooooly* smokes.‚Äô What the [expletive]!? At the same
    time, it created a lot of fun online. So maybe it‚Äôs positive? It‚Äôs some kind of
    ‚Ä¶*impressive* design.‚Äù
