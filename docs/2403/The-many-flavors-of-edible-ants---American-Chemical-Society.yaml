    Liu and his team at San Diego State University analyzed the odor profiles of four
    species: the chicatana ant, common black ant, spiny ant and weaver ant.'

- en: The researchers identified the volatile compounds present in samples from each
    species, using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, and matched them to odors
    sensed using an olfactometer. They were puzzled by some volatiles for which they
    were unable to sense an odor; the team later figured out those chemicals were
    ant pheromones. Even at high concentrations, humans aren’t able to smell the alkanes
    that ants use as chemical messengers. But they were able to identify other noticeable
    odors that contribute to the flavor of these ant species.

- en: The team found that common black ants have an acidic and vinegary smell, primarily
    because of their high content of formic acid, which is a compound the ants secrete
    from venom glands. The researchers also detected the presence of large alkanes
    the ants use as alarm pheromones.

- en: Unlike common black ants, the chicatana ants tested did not contain formic acid,
    and their predominant smell was nutty, woody and fatty. The researchers attributed
    fatty, grassy odors to the presence of aldehydes. They say the nutty, roasted
    smell comes from pyrazines, compounds also produced when meats and bread are cooked.
    Chicatana ants use a type of pyrazine as a trail pheromone.
