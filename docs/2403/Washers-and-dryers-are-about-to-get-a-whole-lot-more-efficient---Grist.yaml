    a figure that does not include the energy needed to heat the water swirling through
    the washing machine. Beyond that financial cost, the appliances contribute mightily
    to the nation’s carbon footprint. On Thursday, the Biden administration announced
    new washer and dryer efficiency standards that could ease those burdens.

- en: The updated standards — first reported by Grist — will result in top-loading
    clothes washers that are 11 percent more energy efficient than similar current
    machines while using 28 percent less water. Dryers will see up to a 40 percent
    reduction in energy use, depending on the model. The requirements are in line
    with current Energy Star efficiency benchmarks, and will apply to equipment produced
    after March 1, 2028.

    the same level of performance but have reduced operating expenses,” a Department
    of Energy official told Grist, speaking on the condition of anonymity. The government
    estimates that the measures will shave $2.2 billion a year from Americans’ utility
    bills and, over 30 years, eliminate 71 million tons of planet-warming carbon dioxide
    emissions. That’s equivalent to the annual emissions of nearly 9 million homes.

    consumer advocacy organizations last fall that outlined efficiency standards and
    implementation timelines for six appliance categories. The government has already
    adopted the group’s recommendations for [stoves](https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2024/01/29/gas-stoves-biden-energy-climate/)
    and [refrigerators and freezers](https://www.energy.gov/articles/doe-finalizes-efficiency-standards-residential-refrigerators-and-freezers-closing-out).
    New criteria for other refrigeration products (such as wine coolers), as well
    dishwashers, are expected in the coming months. If a consumer were to swap the
    least efficient model available today to the most common models available under
    the new efficiency standards, they would [save around $120 per year](https://appliance-standards.org/document/final-stove-standards-will-reduce-waste-primarily-electric-models),
    according to the Appliance Standards Awareness Project, a nonprofit that helped
    negotiate the new standards.

    that saves some energy,” Jill Notini, vice president of the Association of Home
    Appliance Manufacturers, or AHAM, said in an email. “[It] also allows manufacturers
    to provide consumers with the products and features they love and rely upon.”

    a “[war on appliances](https://www.foxbusiness.com/politics/war-appliances-continues-biden-admin-releases-new-rules-dishwashers),”
    that would leave clothes “[dirtier and stinkier](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/biden-washing-machine-rule-would-make-americans-dirtier-stinkier-raise-prices-manufacturers).”
    But Joanna Mauer, deputy director of the Appliance Standards Awareness Project,
    points out that Energy Star models tend to score higher than more conventional
    appliances in Consumer Reports testing.

    she said. “Over-drying clothes doesn’t just waste energy, but can also shrink
    or otherwise damage them.”

    appliance proposals, which were released in 2022 and 2023, and succeeded in weakening
    several of them through the joint recommendations. The most notable change involved
    gas stoves — a debate that [proved particularly contentious](https://grist.org/regulation/suggested-ban-gas-stoves-ignites-culture-war/).
    The standards for some washer models were also slightly lower than those the Biden
    administration first put forward. But, Mauer said, they still “achieve the bulk
    of the potential consumer savings.”

- en: This is the first time that washer and dryer standards have been updated in
    more than a decade, a step Mauer said is long overdue. By law, the government
    is supposed to review appliance standards every six years, a procedure that AHAM
    [has criticized](https://d1dth6e84htgma.cloudfront.net/09_13_23_ENG_Testimony_Messner_ebb2785c55.pdf)
    as “resulting in a never-ending regulatory churn regardless of who is in the White
    House.” But the Trump administration stalled the process, pushing revisions well
    past their deadlines. In 2022, the Department of Energy reached a [legal settlement
    with environment, consumer and housing nonprofits](https://www.nrdc.org/bio/joe-vukovich/doe-settles-suit-about-overdue-efficiency-updates)
    that laid out the current schedule.
