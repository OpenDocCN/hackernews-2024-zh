- en: Doing laundry accounts for about [8 percent of a home’s annual electricity use](https://www.eia.gov/consumption/residential/data/2020/c&e/pdf/ce5.1a.pdf),
    a figure that does not include the energy needed to heat the water swirling through
    the washing machine. Beyond that financial cost, the appliances contribute mightily
    to the nation’s carbon footprint. On Thursday, the Biden administration announced
    new washer and dryer efficiency standards that could ease those burdens.

  zh: 洗衣占据了一个家庭年度电力消耗的约[8％](https://www.eia.gov/consumption/residential/data/2020/c&e/pdf/ce5.1a.pdf)，这个数字不包括加热通过洗衣机流动的水所需的能源。除了财务成本之外，这些电器还大大增加了国家的碳足迹。上周四，拜登政府宣布了新的洗衣机和烘干机效率标准，这可能会减轻这些负担。
- en: The updated standards — first reported by Grist — will result in top-loading
    clothes washers that are 11 percent more energy efficient than similar current
    machines while using 28 percent less water. Dryers will see up to a 40 percent
    reduction in energy use, depending on the model. The requirements are in line
    with current Energy Star efficiency benchmarks, and will apply to equipment produced
    after March 1, 2028.

  zh: 更新的标准首次由Grist报道，将导致顶部装载式洗衣机比类似当前机型更高效，节能11％，同时用水减少28％。烘干机的能耗将减少多达40％，具体取决于机型。这些要求符合当前能源之星的效率基准，并将适用于2028年3月1日之后生产的设备。
- en: “These rules represent an opportunity for more efficient appliances that provide
    the same level of performance but have reduced operating expenses,” a Department
    of Energy official told Grist, speaking on the condition of anonymity. The government
    estimates that the measures will shave $2.2 billion a year from Americans’ utility
    bills and, over 30 years, eliminate 71 million tons of planet-warming carbon dioxide
    emissions. That’s equivalent to the annual emissions of nearly 9 million homes.

  zh: “这些规定代表了提供相同性能但减少运营费用的更高效电器的机会，”一位匿名的能源部官员在接受Grist采访时说道。政府估计，这些措施每年将从美国人的水电费中节省22亿美元，并在30年内消除7100万吨温室气体二氧化碳排放量。这相当于近900万户家庭的年排放量。
- en: The updates are drawn from a deal manufacturers struck with environmental and
    consumer advocacy organizations last fall that outlined efficiency standards and
    implementation timelines for six appliance categories. The government has already
    adopted the group’s recommendations for [stoves](https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2024/01/29/gas-stoves-biden-energy-climate/)
    and [refrigerators and freezers](https://www.energy.gov/articles/doe-finalizes-efficiency-standards-residential-refrigerators-and-freezers-closing-out).
    New criteria for other refrigeration products (such as wine coolers), as well
    dishwashers, are expected in the coming months. If a consumer were to swap the
    least efficient model available today to the most common models available under
    the new efficiency standards, they would [save around $120 per year](https://appliance-standards.org/document/final-stove-standards-will-reduce-waste-primarily-electric-models),
    according to the Appliance Standards Awareness Project, a nonprofit that helped
    negotiate the new standards.

    Standards Awareness Project的说法。

    that saves some energy,” Jill Notini, vice president of the Association of Home
    Appliance Manufacturers, or AHAM, said in an email. “[It] also allows manufacturers
    to provide consumers with the products and features they love and rely upon.”

    a “[war on appliances](https://www.foxbusiness.com/politics/war-appliances-continues-biden-admin-releases-new-rules-dishwashers),”
    that would leave clothes “[dirtier and stinkier](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/biden-washing-machine-rule-would-make-americans-dirtier-stinkier-raise-prices-manufacturers).”
    But Joanna Mauer, deputy director of the Appliance Standards Awareness Project,
    points out that Energy Star models tend to score higher than more conventional
    appliances in Consumer Reports testing.

    Star型号在消费者报告测试中往往比传统家电得分更高。
- en: “These new standards will help ensure that dryers aren’t over-drying clothes,”
    she said. “Over-drying clothes doesn’t just waste energy, but can also shrink
    or otherwise damage them.”

- en: AHAM was among the organizations that pushed back on the government’s initial
    appliance proposals, which were released in 2022 and 2023, and succeeded in weakening
    several of them through the joint recommendations. The most notable change involved
    gas stoves — a debate that [proved particularly contentious](https://grist.org/regulation/suggested-ban-gas-stoves-ignites-culture-war/).
    The standards for some washer models were also slightly lower than those the Biden
    administration first put forward. But, Mauer said, they still “achieve the bulk
    of the potential consumer savings.”

- en: This is the first time that washer and dryer standards have been updated in
    more than a decade, a step Mauer said is long overdue. By law, the government
    is supposed to review appliance standards every six years, a procedure that AHAM
    [has criticized](https://d1dth6e84htgma.cloudfront.net/09_13_23_ENG_Testimony_Messner_ebb2785c55.pdf)
    as “resulting in a never-ending regulatory churn regardless of who is in the White
    House.” But the Trump administration stalled the process, pushing revisions well
    past their deadlines. In 2022, the Department of Energy reached a [legal settlement
    with environment, consumer and housing nonprofits](https://www.nrdc.org/bio/joe-vukovich/doe-settles-suit-about-overdue-efficiency-updates)

  zh: 这是十多年来首次更新洗衣机和烘干机标准，莫尔称这一步已经迫在眉睫。根据法律，政府应该每六年审查一次家电标准，这一程序被家电制造商协会批评为“不管白宫里的是谁都会导致永无止境的法规变更”。但是特朗普政府拖延了这一过程，将修订远远推迟。2022年，能源部与环境、消费者和住房非营利组织达成了[法律和解](https://www.nrdc.org/bio/joe-vukovich/doe-settles-suit-about-overdue-efficiency-updates)，规定了当前的时间表。
