- en: Thanks to immense gravitational forces, the regions around black holes are violent
    and turbulent environments driven by physics that cannot be found anywhere else
    in the universe. In fact, black holes are so influential that, when they rotate,
    they drag the very fabric of space along with them. In other words, near a black
    hole, nothing stands still. Nothing at all.

    can't be dragged down to Earth, so these effects can be studied in the lab — but
    a research team, led by University of Nottingham scientists, has done the next
    best thing.  The researchers created, for the first time, a swirling "quantum
    vortex" in a helium superfluid chilled to ultracold temperatures. This apparatus
    essentially mimics a black hole right on our planet.

    superfluid, which is a material capable of displaying frictionless flow (or incredibly
    low viscosity) and other exotic behaviors observed at temperatures near [absolute
    zero](https://www.space.com/19127-atoms-colder-than-absolute-zero.html). These
    are behaviors that mimic conditions found near [rotating black holes](https://www.space.com/historic-donut-black-hole-is-spinning-new-study-finds).

    detail and accuracy than with our previous experiments in water," Patrik Svancara,
    team leader and a researcher at the University of Nottingham, [said in a statement](https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1038009).
    "As the viscosity of superfluid helium is extremely small, we were able to meticulously
    investigate their interaction with the superfluid tornado and compare the findings
    with our own theoretical projections."'

- en: To understand how a superfluid vortex could resemble a black hole, it is vital
    to remember what Einstein's 1915 theory of [general relativity](https://www.space.com/17661-theory-general-relativity.html)
    tells us about black holes. General relativity suggests that space and time are
    a single entity called spacetime, and that gravity arises when objects of mass
    cause spacetime to curve.

    an infinitely dense and compact mass — a central singularity where the very laws
    of physics break down. The outer boundary of these spacetime regions is called
    the [event horizon](https://www.space.com/black-holes-event-horizon-explained.html),
    and it represents the point at which not even light is fast enough to match the
    black hole's escape velocity.

- en: 'Black holes only have three known characteristics: Electric charge, mass and
    angular momentum, or "spin." A rotating black hole, or a "Kerr black hole," with
    angular momentum also drags the fabric of spacetime around with it in the direction
    of its rotation, an effect known as "[frame dragging](https://www.space.com/einstein-general-relativity-frame-dragging.html),"
    or the Lense-Thirring effect after the scientists who first proposed it.'

- en: Considering how the Lense-Thirring effect and forces matter around a Kerr black
    hole into constant motion, it makes sense that a vortex in a fluid, or maybe a
    tornado in the atmosphere, would be very loosely analogous to such a region of
    spacetime. But, what's key with the team's black-hole-simulation vortex is that
    it isn't found in any old fluid. It was made in a superfluid chilled to absolute
    zero.

    capable of holding several liters of helium and chilling it to temperatures below
    minus 456 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 271 degrees Celsius). This is around 3 to
    4 degrees above [absolute zero](https://www.space.com/19127-atoms-colder-than-absolute-zero.html),
    equal to minus 459.76 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 273.15 degrees Celsius). Absolute
    zero is theoretically the coldest possible temperature. At absolute zero, all

    properties that would usually hinder the formation of giant vortices. This system
    showed how this can't really be worked around; the team ultimately built a quantum
    tornado in the ultracold superfluid using a multitude of smaller parts.

    to spread apart from each other," Svancara continued. "In our set-up, we''ve managed
    to confine tens of thousands of these quanta in a compact object resembling a
    small tornado, achieving a vortex flow with record-breaking strength in the realm
    of quantum fluids."'

    and the way the gravity of black holes influences spacetime. The team hopes that
    the experiment will open up a way to simulate quantum physics more broadly within
    curved spacetime generally, and even around black-hole curved spacetime.

    analog experiment back in 2017, it was a breakthrough moment for understanding
    some of the bizarre phenomena that are often challenging, if not impossible, to
    study otherwise," Silke Weinfurtner, leader of the Black Hole Laboratory where
    this experiment was developed and conducted, explained in the statement.
