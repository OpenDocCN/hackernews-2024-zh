    reversed.

    expectations of early or immediate success, you’ll want to hash that out now before
    going forward and having the test fail. Your discussions will mostly revolve around
    managing the timing and scale of expectations rather than the outcome or solution.

    change. It was an extremely risky bet I had high confidence in. When it was approved,
    it was conditionally so - “we’ll check later to see how effective it is.”

    an awkward spot of trying to justify the test’s underperformance. I could have
    avoided this altogether had I ensured I aligned early on expectations of when
    the outcome could reasonably be measured.

    constraints or guardrails to address a perceived or real risk. The most common
