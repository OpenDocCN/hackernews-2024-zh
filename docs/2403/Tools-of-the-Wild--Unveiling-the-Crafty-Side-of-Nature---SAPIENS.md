# Tools of the Wild: Unveiling the Crafty Side of Nature – SAPIENS

Material is immaterial. The objects can be anything—sand grains, grass stems, soap bubbles, you name it. If a critter can perceive and manipulate the item, it’s fair game.

But we do believe there is one limitation: Tools must be portable. With a watering can, you can dampen any garden in the world. With a hose attached to your house, not so much. The obvious drawback for fixed objects, even flexible ones like a hose or a hanging vine, is that your reach is extremely limited. From this come other limits on how you can combine one object with another or share. Portable tools can be passed around and passed on.

## TOOLS AND SMARTS

Under this new definition, tool use is decoupled from intelligence, intention, and human-like cognitive processes; tool use instead describes an action—a behavior that can be observed.

Human tool use has long served as the de facto standard to assess other animals’ capabilities. Anthropologists have asked: Which animals do things like humans—and therefore must be clever like our kind? What can these other species tell us about ourselves and our ancestors?

We think it’s time to flip the script.

Instead, researchers should ask what tool use reveals about how animals view *their* worlds. What is important to those creatures, and how do they get things done?

Scientists should also avoid lumping an entire species together when talking about “tool users.” As far as researchers have observed, [*most* individual chimps](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ajp.22284) do *not* use stone tools. And *most* dolphins, monkeys, octopuses, and crows seem to forgo tools entirely. Instead, this behavior, like many others, is often related to factors such as sex, age or stage-of-life, social role, or individual personality—even in [those leaf-sponging ants](https://elifesciences.org/articles/61298). For most animals, we know little about the pressures that prompt them to select, modify, and team up with pieces of their world.
