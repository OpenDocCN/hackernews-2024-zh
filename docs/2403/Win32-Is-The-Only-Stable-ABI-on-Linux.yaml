- en: In the ELF format there are two ways of providing a hash table of symbols. `DT_HASH`
    and `DT_GNU_HASH`. The first one is part of [SYSV generic ABI](http://www.sco.com/developers/gabi/latest/ch5.dynamic.html#hash)
    and is well documented and marked as mandatory. `DT_GNU_HASH` is a newer, smaller,
    and faster replacement that is [not documented](https://sourceware.org/legacy-ml/binutils/2006-10/msg00377.html),
    implemented in a few places (Glibc, GNU ld, Musl, LLVM, mold, etc.) and a subject
    of a [couple](https://flapenguin.me/elf-dt-gnu-hash) of [blog](http://deroko.phearless.org/dt_gnu_hash.txt)
    posts that I’ve [found](https://blogs.oracle.com/solaris/post/gnu-hash-elf-sections).
    Turns out it also doesn’t provide the same functionality as `DT_HASH`. To get
    the number of symbols you have to [completely parse it](https://groups.google.com/g/generic-abi/c/th5919osPAQ/m/hRL78ooqBAAJ).

    are [not forced to follow the generic ABI](https://groups.google.com/g/generic-abi/c/th5919osPAQ/m/CWQyAu36AwAJ).
    Glibc uses `ELFOSABI_GNU` so technically not including `DT_HASH` is fine.

    There’s also an open source project that has regressed - a frame rate limiter
    called [libstrangle](https://bugs.gentoo.org/863863). The non-EAC game [Shovel
    Knight is broken as well](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/issues/6051#issuecomment-1212748397).

    shortly after the Glibc 2.36 release. I suspect there will be more broken games
    (and other software) once 2.36 will hit the mainstream.

    changing ABI is okay as long as no one has noticed, but once it gets noticed -
    then it’s a regression. Once it’s a thing people depend on, it becomes a feature.

    and most distributions have switched to using it and only it by default. For those
    16 years, it was Glibc who provided the compatibility and overrode the defaults
    for everyone and there never were any easy-to-spot deprecation warnings. It’s
    also unrealistic to expect every ELF consumer to keep up with undocumented developments
    of the format.

    It’s hard to blame developers for targeting Windows and relying on Wine + friends.
    It’s just much more stable and much less likely to break and stay broken.
