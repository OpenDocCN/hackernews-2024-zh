    client that was not yet named [Matter](https://matter.xyz/). We eventually transitioned
    from an agency-client relationship to a startup relationship, where I became the
    VP of Technology. This is what I've been doing for the past two-ish years.

- en: When we were trying to figure out how to turn some of the neuroscience, existing
    material, and lots of our CEO Axel's ideas into a product, we started discussing
    the idea of building an app around the concept of allowing users to log memories
    that they could later recall to improve their [happiness](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29016167/).
    As a natural skeptic, it took me a little while to come around to believing that
    this was even possible and wasn't just hand-wavy *wellness* stuff. I've since
    been convinced that we have technology that—when employed correctly—*can* actually
    improve happiness by having our users recall positive experiences. And we have
    actual science (which I will link in the future) that proves that their brains
    will create/release neurotransmitters ("happiness chemicals" in the context of
    what we're working on) in line with their original positive experience, making
    them feel happier. For real.

    photos of these positive experiences, as well as logging ratings of the emotions
    they experienced so they could recall them later to stimulate these neurotransmitters.

    I have to ask: why would I ever send you a private photo and a positive rating

    party like Facebook, so why would I do it for *us*?"'

    user content, and how we model threats against this private data. We adopted user
    privacy as a core value, and how we think about this informs many other decisions
    we make with the app and the whole ecosystem handling our users' data. This became
    so important to us that we knew it needed to be one of the foundational aspects
    of how we work and *this decision informed the product*, not the inverse. We knew
    it was not something we could bolt on later—that trying to add this once we'd
    already exposed user data (to *even ourselves*) would be error-prone at best,
    and impossible at worst.

    you've done that. We've intentionally set up our metrics system to refuse to collect
    this kind of personal data, and we (the people and systems at Matter) simply never
    get it (only the app running on your device gets this data). We don't store the
    data on our servers (outside of analytics—and even then never the data we consider
    *private* like emotion ratings); it always stays on your device and within your
    device's datastore. (Matter is an iPhone app, so we store data on your phone with
    Core Data, and in a private database that syncs within your iCloud account, but
    is set up in a way that even *we* can't access it. The app code that runs within
    our developer credentials, on your device, can read and write this data, but it
    is never sent to us and we have no way of accessing it through Apple's tooling.
    It's truly private to you.)

    inputs, but never in a way that we can reverse it. A very simple version of this
    is if we were to collect the product of an a multiplication operation with the
    value "600", we don't know if the inputs were "1 × 600", "100 × 6", "30 × 20",
    "12 × 50", etc. We don't know what went into a *Matter Score* for a memory but
    we do know the score. We know the "600" but not the "8" or the "75". We don't
    even know how you described a memory or what's in a photo you attached. All we
    know is that there *is* a memory, it has a score of 600, and it belongs to a numbered
    account.

    this is maybe the most controversial of our decisions. We don't have accounts;
    we don't even currently have email addresses, outside of our mailing list. There
    is no forced association between our mailing list users and our app users. In
    the future, we may allow users to opt in to self-identifying, but even then we'll
    continue to be careful about never collecting *private* data.

    We don't want to (and we don't) hold these, either—at least not in a way we can
    see them. We primarily store these images on your device, but because the size
    of this storage is limited, we do have a system for storing assets such as images
    that have been encrypted on-device, and the actual photo contents or the decryption
    keys are never sent to us. We store data for users, here, but to us it looks like
    random noise (the binary ciphertext), never like a photo of whatever it is you're
    storing a photo of. I intend to write more about this in the future, since we
    expect to publish some open source tooling related to this.

    that to protect themselves from data loss. We've put a lot of thought into storing
    these backups *for* a user, but having that user identify themselves is a difficult
    problem. Storing that data on behalf of the user, in a way that we can't get to
    it is also a problem. But a very interesting problem. I think we have good solutions
    to these problems that we expect to build into the app before we're out of beta,
    and I also hope to post about this in the future.
