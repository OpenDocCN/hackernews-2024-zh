- en: Most driver’s license suspensions in Ohio do not stem from reasons relating
    to being a bad driver. In fact, over 60 percent of Ohio’s driver’s license suspensions
    arise because the driver owes a debt that has not been paid. We label these debt-related
    suspensions (DRS).

- en: According to a report by the Legal Aid Society of Cleveland, in an average year,
    over 1.7 million Ohio drivers have over 3.2 million active debt-related suspensions,
    indicating that drivers often face more than one DRS at a time. While DRS are
    over-represented in Ohio’s central cities, DRS are a problem throughout the state—60
    percent of all suspensions are on drivers *outside* of Ohio’s central cities.
    The financial implications of DRS are substantial. From 2016 through 2020, the
    Ohio Bureau of Motor Vehicles (BMV) and third-party creditors levied an average
    of about $150 million in charges and fees related to DRS, but drivers only paid
    about $33 million per year during that period. The unpaid amount accumulates over
    time, averaging about $922 million during those five years. Furthermore, DRS are
    much more frequently found in high poverty and minority communities.

    This could prevent people from getting to the place where they could make the
    money needed to repay the debt and have their license reinstated. It also could
    prevent them from getting a new job that requires a driver’s license.

    force. However, accurately estimating those implications is quite difficult based
    upon the available data. Instead, we provide labor market context for DRS on two
    dimensions. First, we use two hypothetical scenarios based on the share of people
    in the labor force that comply with DRS or not to illustrate risks of DRS. Second,
    we investigate how often a valid driver’s license is requested by employers in
    online job postings.

    if just half of those with a DRS were to comply, the impact statewide could result
    in a potential loss of over 830,000 working or work-seeking individuals from the
    labor force.

    higher than the national average (10.6 percent) in 2022 and has increased 10 percent

- en: The share of job ads requesting a driver’s license varies significantly by industry
    and by geography, indicating that some portions of Ohio’s economy have the potential
    to be more impacted by DRS than others. For instance, the percent of jobs requiring
    a driver’s license increases as you move from core urban areas to the metropolitan
    fringe and is highest in nonmetropolitan Ohio.

- en: Lower- and middle-wage occupations tend to have the highest rates of job ads
    requesting a driver’s license. This indicates that DRS can be more problematic
    for hiring into middle- and lower-wage occupations and suggests that a driver’s
    license is important for one’s economic mobility in the lower half of the wage
    distribution.

    obtained a count of all driver’s license suspensions, as well as detailed financial
    information about eight types of suspensions that we determined to be debt related.
    The data were aggregated and provided at the zip code level for the years 2016–2020\.
    To analyze the DRS data relative to Ohio population, demographic, and employment
    data, we matched the DRS zip codes to the Census Bureau equivalent: Zip Code Tabulation
    Areas (ZCTAs).'

    ads comes from Lightcast and is aggregated to produce annual estimates of the
    share of job ads asking for a driver’s license.

- en: Resulting in over 1.7 million licenses suspended annually, DRS have the potential
    to significantly impact Ohio’s labor force. However, the available data is lacking
    a few key inputs to precisely estimate those impacts. At the most basic level,
    for those receiving a DRS, we do not know if they were employed, if they were
    looking for work, how likely they were to disregard the suspension and keep driving,
    if they could get to work without driving, and the length of suspension. Given
    these limitations, we use labor market information to conduct two hypothetical
    scenarios to illustrate the risks of DRS to Ohio’s labor force. Each scenario
    is based on upon the share of the labor force that is subject to a binding DRS
    shock, in which they abide by the suspension and cannot get to or look for work,
    so they end up leaving the labor force. As mentioned above, we do not know how
    likely someone is to abide by the suspension and not drive, so we present a scenario
    in which half of those receiving a DRS comply with the suspension and another
    scenario in which all of those receiving a DRS comply with the suspension.

- en: To help introduce these scenarios, let us first consider the share of the labor
    force that is at risk of a DRS in this framework. In 2020, the 1.66 million DRS
    would equate to 28.9 percent of Ohio’s labor force at risk of receiving a DRS
    (Table 1). Accordingly, it is probably best to consider the estimates in Table
    1 and the two scenario tables (Tables 2 & 3) to be upper bounds for percent of
    labor force at risk as it is possible that not all those with a DRS are in the
    labor force or require driving to the workplace. Relatedly, while each scenario
    as presented refers to the potential labor force declines from a binding DRS,
    one could just as easily examine potential gains from removing a hypothetical
    binding DRS policy that is keeping 1.66 million Ohioans out of the labor force.
    Furthermore, the labor force impacts are more likely to touch those in poor and
    nonwhite communities as they are more likely to have received a DRS.

    those receiving a DRS comply with the suspension, and they end up leaving the
    labor force because they are unable to get to or look for work without a driver’s
    license. In this scenario, 830,000 workers (14.4 percent) end up leaving the labor
    force, effectively lowering the labor force participation rate by almost 9 percentage
    points, from 61.6 percent to 52.7 percent (Table 2). Based upon these numbers,
    there are potentially significant labor force impacts if only half of those receiving
    a DRS comply with the suspension.

    suspension. Under this scenario, almost a third of the labor force is impacted
    by a DRS and leave the labor force, lowering the labor force participation rate
    by 18 percentage points to 43.7 percent (Table 3). The potential impacts from
    this scenario would cause a significant slowdown in economic activity as roughly
    only two out of every five working age Ohioans would be in the labor force.

    implications of Scenario 1 where half of all individuals with a DRS would leave
