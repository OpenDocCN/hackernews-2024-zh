- en: By blocking the accounts and groups of Społeczna Inicjatywa Narkopolityki (SIN,
    the Civil Society Drug Policy Initiative), Meta has infringed on the organization’s
    personal rights. On Wednesday, a Polish court issued a watershed decision in a
    case supported by the Panoptykon Foundation, thereby confirming that Internet
    platforms cannot block users at will. The court also confirmed that banned users
    have the right to sue in their own country.

    online freedom of expression. For five years, two Polish organizations fought
    for access to a trial in Poland, for the right to have the moderators’ decisions
    explained and for the right to effectively contest such by the people and organizations
    wrongfully blocked on social media.

    our followership, although it did take a lot of work. But our old Facebook page
    was a goldmine of information on harm reduction, dependence prevention and specific
    psychoactive substances. It was also a repository of memories from the first seven
    years of SIN’s work.”'

    on Facebook and Instagram, and the first one where the court ruled in favor of
    the organization that contested an arbitrary blocking.

    and without providing them the possibility to effectively challenge the decision.
    Such actions are unlawful. Until now, blocking decisions have often been made
    arbitrarily and in a non-transparent manner. It has been difficult to contest
    them in practice. Any attempts to appeal them have seemed rather Kafkaesque. We
    are hoping that now, thanks to this ruling, we will no longer be helpless against
    private censorship.”'

    decision before making changes to its moderation practices. In August 2023, the
    European Union adopted the Digital Services Act (DSA), which imposes specific
    requirements on very large Internet platforms, including obligations related precisely
    to content moderation.

    and the possibility of appeal – should never happen to anyone again. Today, the
    DSA clearly says that platforms must substantiate their decision on content removal
    or visibility reduction, and create appropriate appeal procedures for their users.
    Still, Głowacka stresses the significance of the decision in blazing the legal
    trail for people aggrieved by the wrongful blocking of their account. No less
    importantly, the court has confirmed our right to sue global platforms in Poland,
    under Polish law, rather than exclusively in Ireland, as Meta has argued before
    the court.

    the Community Standards. We were also not given the possibility to effectively
    appeal the ban. Years of our work and memories recorded on this page were at the
    mercy of corporate whims. Facebook was SIN’s primary communication channel, but
    more importantly, it was also a goldmine of information on harm reduction, dependence
    prevention and specific psychoactive substances. A popular fanpage with an archive
    of information amassed over 7 years could reach more people in need, and the knowledge
    collected there could help minimize risks and protect people’s health.”
