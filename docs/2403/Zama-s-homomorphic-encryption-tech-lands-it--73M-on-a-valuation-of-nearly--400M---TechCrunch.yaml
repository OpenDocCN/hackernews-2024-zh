- en: Homomorphic encryption, a complex technique that uses cryptographic algorithms
    to keep data secure as it travels around networks and to third parties, continues
    to elude mass-market scalability and thus adoption — not least because currently,
    the complexity that makes it so effective also makes it slow and hard to use widely.

    holds a lot of promise for ensuring data security longer term, so investors continue
    to fund startups staffed with smart people chipping away at making the concept
    into a reality.

    has raised $73 million in a Series A co-led by Multicoin Capital and Protocol
    Labs at a valuation approaching $400 million. Notably, among the longer list of
    other investors in this equity round is Metaplanet, a deep tech investor out of
    Estonia that wrote the first check for DeepMind (among hundreds of other investments).

    out of Europe, but also maybe globally. Amid an ongoing funding crunch globally,
    deep tech in the region appears to still open checkbooks. Earlier this week, quantum
    startup [Multiverse Computing](https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/04/multiverse-computing/)
    also picked up $27 million.

    $50 million in contract value,” said Rand Hindi, Zama co-founder and CEO, in an
    interview. Although Hindi firmly believes that the longer-term bigger business
    will be in machine learning, customers so far have primarily come from the blockchain
    camp, so the $50 million is a rough estimate of value since not all of these operate
    in fiat.

    the total now to $81 million raised. We understand from sources that the latest
    funding puts the company’s valuation at the high end of $300 million to $400 million,
    although Hindi declined to disclose the amount.

    mainstream markets, especially in the current funding climate, there are a couple
    of reasons why the company has attracted attention.

    decade of computing. Zama’s technology is the key to build multiplayer, privacy-preserving
    applications,” said Kyle Samani, managing partner of Multicoin Capital, in a statement.
    “Zama’s groundbreaking work on open source FHE tooling is only the beginning.
    We are proud to help them build the next generation of crypto-enabled, privacy-first
    applications.”

    he’s a polymath interested in AI as well as privacy and how to preserve it in
    the modern world. One of his previous startups was an AI voice platform called
    Snips that was [acquired by Sonos](https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/20/sonos-acquires-voice-assistant-startup-snips-potentially-to-build-out-on-device-voice-control/).

    (he [notes](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ppaillier/) he has some 25 patent families

    would become Zama. The breakthrough, Hindi said, was in 2019 when they arrived
    at algorithms that sped up calculations by 100x.

    but given that blockchain transactions themselves are typically slow-moving, that
    presented an opportunity to offer Zama’s solutions to crypto developers. As Hindi
    puts it, whether you are a skeptic on crypto or not, when you consider payroll
    and other kinds of financial transactions that are being created, it’s undeniable,
    he said, that “hundreds of thousands of people are building on the blockchain,
    and this gives them an opportunity to build more.”

    of a [holy grail](https://techcrunch.com/2022/08/23/ravel-emerges-from-stealth-with-privacy-first-data-tools-based-on-scalable-homomorphic-encryption/)

    for the calculations, which are being developed by both [startups](https://techcrunch.com/2023/02/23/chain-reaction-raises-70m-emerges-from-stealth-to-launch-chips-designed-to-compute-encrypted-data/)

    techniques to compress the work involved to carry out homomorphic encryption on
    existing infrastructure. Its libraries and work to date include fully homomorphic
    encryption libraries to bring [FHE to machine learning](https://github.com/zama-ai/concrete-ml);
    a [compiler](https://github.com/zama-ai/concrete) to help translate Python programs
    into the FHE equivalent; and a [library](https://github.com/zama-ai/fhevm) to
    enable an entity to interact with an Ethereum virtual machine using homomorphic
    encryption.

    I would add — that the aim is really to continue growing the market.
