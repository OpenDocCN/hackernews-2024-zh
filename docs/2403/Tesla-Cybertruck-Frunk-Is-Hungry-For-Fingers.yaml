    another poorly executed feature on the [Tesla Cybertruck](https://jalopnik.com/why-tesla-cybertrucks-are-rusting-despite-being-made-of-1851257091)
    emerges. Today’s lesson; the Cybertruck’s front trunk or frunk seems to have the
    potential to seriously injure misplaced fingers.

- en: A video shared to X (Twitter) shows a Cybertruck’s frunk being put up against
    the closing mechanisms of other vehicles. In these tests veggies thankfully stand
    in for human fingers. The Cybertruck snaps the crudité placed on the sharp edge
    of the front lid without a second thought, while other luxury automakers’ trunk
    lids tend to leave the veggies intact, though it’s certainly not perfect across
    the board.

- en: Most vehicles that have features like automatic closing doors, trunks, etc,
    have sensors that will detect and stop doors from closing if something like an
    extremity is detected in the gap. The Cybertruck doesn’t appear to have that around
    the frunk’s edges, allowing the door to completely close on the veggies. Imagining
    your finger in there is enough to give anyone pause. The truck does have a censor
    for the front of the frunk’s door, but not on the pointy, smashy sides.

    vehicle. Along with a digit-hungry frunk, the Cybertruck reportedly suffers from
