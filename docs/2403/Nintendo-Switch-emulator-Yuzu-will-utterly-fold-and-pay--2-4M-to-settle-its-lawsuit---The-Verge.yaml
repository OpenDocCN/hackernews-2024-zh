- en: Just over a week ago, [Nintendo sued the developers of the leading Nintendo
    Switch emulator, Yuzu](/2024/2/27/24085075/nintendo-switch-emulator-yuzu-lawsuit),
    for “facilitating piracy at a colossal scale.” Now, it appears that Yuzu will
    give up without a fight — and give Nintendo everything it wanted. And it affects
    the Nintendo 3DS emulator Citra, too.

    to Nintendo but also says Yuzu is “primarily designed to circumvent and play Nintendo
    Switch games.” The company agrees to be permanently enjoined from working on Yuzu,
    hosting Yuzu, distributing Yuzu’s code or features, hosting websites and social
    media that promote Yuzu, or doing anything else that circumvents Nintendo’s copyright
    protection.

    Lockpick_RCM, NDDumpTool, nxDumpFuse, and TegraExplorer,” and hand over any “physical

    good faith, out of passion for Nintendo and its consoles and games, and were not
    intending to cause harm. But we see now that because our projects can circumvent
    Nintendo’s technological protection measures and allow users to play games outside
    of authorized hardware, they have led to extensive piracy. In particular, we have
    been deeply disappointed when users have used our software to leak game content
    prior to its release and ruin the experience for legitimate purchasers and fans.

    Piracy was never our intention, and we believe that piracy of video games and
    on video game consoles should end. Effective today, we will be pulling our code
    repositories offline, discontinuing our Patreon accounts and Discord servers,
    and, soon, shutting down our websites. We hope our actions will be a small step
    toward ending piracy of all creators’ works.

    on Wednesday March 6th. But on Monday, the source code [for Yuzu](https://github.com/yuzu-emu/yuzu)
    and [Citra](https://github.com/citra-emu/citra) had both already been pulled down
    from GitHub, and their websites were replaced with a copy of Bunnei’s message.

    of both emulators and their source code are in the wild. Some online supporters
    specifically mentioned backing up the Yuzu code after Nintendo sued two weeks
    ago.

    Yuzu and Citra. If Yuzu had fought this lawsuit in court, [one of the biggest
    questions](/2024/2/27/24085075/nintendo-switch-emulator-yuzu-lawsuit#:~:text=bring%2Dyour%2Down%2DBIOS%20approach)
    would have been whether Yuzu is actually circumventing Nintendo’s protections
    since the emulator itself does not contain Nintendo’s keys. (Yuzu is a “bring-your-own-BIOS”
    emulator.) But now, Nintendo and Tropic Haze are asking a judge to specifically
    find that Yuzu circumvents its copyright protections by using those keys, even
    if it doesn’t come with them.

    functions only when cryptographic keys are integrated without authorization, violates
    the Digital Millennium Copyright Act’s prohibition on trafficking in devices that
    circumvent effective technological measures, because the software is primarily
    designed for the purpose of circumventing technological measures.

    a chilling effect, it shouldn't create a legal precedent. "Good news is that settlements
    are not legal determinations even with court sign off so they are not legally
    precedential," Richard Hoeg, a business attorney who hosts the Virtual Legality
    podcast, tells The Verge.

    liability. "It’s a lot of money, but it’s a known amount, and I suspect the advice
    they were getting was that their exposure was high and they had a good chance
    to lose after paying lawyers for a long time."
