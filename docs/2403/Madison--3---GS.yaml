- en: Besides the initial price, which was too high, one of the reasons this place
    didn’t appeal to most potential buyers is that it didn’t show well. Buyers have
    gotten used to carefully staged listings with virtual 3D tours and professional
    photography. (I use those myself when appealing to prospective tenants. It’s money
    well spent.) Most buyers simply can’t see past other people’s furniture, decor,
    or outdated fixtures.

    tenants move out. What’s actually for sale is the structure and the dirt under
    it. This particular building isn’t perfect, but the things that are wrong with
    it are relatively simple to fix and can be addressed incrementally in a cost effective
    manner.

    landlord isn’t always fun, but it isn’t rocket science once you learn the basics.
    Tenants can be an asset rather than a problem if you approach the situation correctly.
    Even if the eventual goal is to vacate the premises it can be done peacefully
    where everyone ultimately gets what they need.

    these kinds of properties entirely. An old 1950s duplex doesn’t fit the image
    they have inside their heads. That’s a shame because these kinds of properties
    are real problem solvers, especially for people on a tight budget.
