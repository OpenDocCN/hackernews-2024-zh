    Google was just one of several mainstream search engines, not yeta monopolistic
    empire. Dial-up internet (and its iconic dial tone) was [still a thing](https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2006/05/28/part-1-broadband-adoption-in-the-united-states/)
    in many American homes. File-sharing services like Napster and LimeWire were just
    beginning to take off. MP3 players and advances in 3D graphics represented brand-new
    technology.

    their desktop monitors together to set up a local area network (LAN) and play
    multiplayer games — “Half-Life,” “Counter-Strike,” “Starsiege: Tribes,” “StarCraft,”
    “WarCraft” or “Unreal Tournament,” to name just a few. These were informal but
    high-stakes gatherings, then known as LAN parties, whether winning a box of energy
    drinks or just the joy of emerging victorious.'

    among heavy computers and fast food boxes, crashing underneath their desks in
    sleeping bags and taking breaks to pull pranks on each other or watch movies.

    subculture to a [multi-billion dollar industry](https://www.statista.com/topics/868/video-games/)
    that is less about getting together in person and more about a wider web of e-sports
    competitions, the lucrative intersection of gaming and content creation and a
    prominent corporate fingerprint on gameplay, design and monetization.

    in the smartphone era, 25 years ago may feel like a different reality. But for
    millennials and Gen Xers, the boxy monitors and pixelated graphics will be familiar
    reminders of a not-so-distant technological past.

    the era’s gaming culture in her new photobook “LAN Party.” After floating the
    idea on X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter, she received an
    immediate — and visceral — response from old-school gamers all too keen to share
    memories and photos from LAN parties and gaming conventions across the world.

    to the images in K’s call-out post, “but because the photos feel so familiar I
    find myself looking for us all. This is pretty much how most weekends in 2000-2004
    looked for us.”

    with excitement. “I think everyone has some kind of nostalgia for a period before
    they were alive,” K told CNN. “I had people who are 20 years old, who were tweeting
    and being like,‘I was born in the wrong decade.’”

    fernweh — fond, wistful memories for a pastime in times past. It’s strange to
    remember that the internet was once a place you went to spend time with other
    *real* people; a tethered space, not a cling-film-like reality enveloping the
    corporeal world from your own pocket.

    the era of blogs and forums. No one really had 24/7 access. So even though we
    were starting to get high-speed internet, it was still a place that you went,
    rather than just another part of your life. And this feeling of connecting to
    people in other parts of the world was cool. It wasn’t something that was taken
    for granted yet.”

    now feels like naivete) about the possibilities of technology, K explained. The
    book is full of photos featuring people smiling and posing with their desktop
    monitors, pride and fanfare apparent. At that point in time, many new tech products
    were designed with ostentatious playfulness in mind — cellphones were often [blinged
    out](https://www.pinterest.com/pin/198369558580619093/) or swiveled up, cameras
    came in [hot pink shells](https://www.etsy.com/listing/1317004963/vintage-2000s-pink-digital-camera)

    where you felt like you were just charting your own way. I don’t want to romanticize
    it too much, because obviously it wasn’t perfect, but it was a very, very different
    experience.”

- en: It was also a new era for photography. Digital cameras — with which most of
    the photos in “LAN Party” were taken — had just become widely available to the
    public. As a result, the visuals are grainy, unedited and generally low quality
    by today’s standards. Documenting everyday life through images was still an anomaly,
    after all, K said. As such, people in the book’s photos weren’t yet conscious
    of their best angles, nor does it seem they were necessarily trying to look ‘good’
    for the camera.

    “No one really knows how to be in a selfie yet. When digital cameras show up,
    it starts to become a much more everyday thing… people are figuring out, ‘How
    do I look in this picture? What do I do?’”

    early footprints of modern gamer culture stereotypes — dank, antisocial and seemingly
    unhealthy environments. (Despite gaming’s global popularity, today it is sometimes
    characterized as the domain of young White men, internalizing and disseminating
    racist, misogynistic or right-wing politics.)

    the same room with someone, it’s a different experience than doing it online.
    You can only be so much of a jackass to somebody who was sitting three feet away
    from you, whereas today with online games, toxicity is a huge problem. Being anonymous
    online can inspire the worst in people.”

    place. (They have also maintained their status over the years as cultural iconography;

    a party for example, has become a legendary [gamer meme](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/fc7kbe/that_picture_of_a_gamer_ducttaped_to_the_ceiling/)
    in its own right). K acknowledges a fascination among young people in memorializing
    the phenomenon, but the parties are today still mostly hosted and attended “IRL”
    by people who remember what the experience was like the first time around.

    K said. “We have lost a lot of privacy as well. There’s less of a sense of exploration
    because there just isn’t as much out there.”
