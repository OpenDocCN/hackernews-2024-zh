    against decriminalization centers around the visibility of drug use, rather than
    the numerical impact on overdose deaths. So it’s worth noting that the same year
    that decriminalization was passed, Covid-era eviction protections also expired.
    After plummeting in 2020 and 2021, the eviction rate shot back up in 2022 [by
    nearly 25 percent](https://drugpolicy.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/DPA-WhatReallyHappenedM110.pdf).
    Between 2022 and 2023, the state’s homeless population rose by 12 percent.

  zh: 大部分公众舆论反对废罪化，集中在药物使用的可见性上，而非过量死亡的数量影响。因此值得注意的是，与废罪化同时通过的是，疫情期间的驱逐保护措施也到期了。在2020年和2021年暴跌后，2022年[驱逐率飙升了将近25%](https://drugpolicy.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/DPA-WhatReallyHappenedM110.pdf)。2022年至2023年间，该州的无家可归人口增加了12%。

    to worsen the opioid crisis, but their [less-than-ideal](https://www.propublica.org/article/oregon-leaders-hampered-drug-decriminalization-effort#:~:text=This%20is%20the%20day%2Dto,for%20law%20enforcement%20in%20Oregon.)
    implementation certainly seemed to amplify the visibility and social disorder
    associated with it. By failing to fund programs that would have trained law enforcement
    (who were [generally skeptical of decriminalization](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/oregon-drug-war-decriminalization-1234982783/)
    to begin with) on how to direct drug users toward rehabilitation or designing
    a ticketing system that emphasized treatment information, even advocates of Measure

    said Russoniello. But blaming Measure 110 has been called political [fearmongering](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/05/opinion/oregon-decriminalization-drugs-reversal.html),
    rather than evidence-based policy. “The opposition was able to take the frustration
    with all of these social issues that Oregonians are facing and direct people’s
    frustration and anger at the big red herring of Measure 110, even though it isn’t
    backed by any sort of evidence.”

    argue that the law should not encode moral judgments that label some drugs as
    better or worse than others. The logic of decriminalization applies to all drugs,
    not only those that are more politically or culturally palatable. In fact, “The
    impact of decriminalization of heroin, methamphetamine, and cocaine will be greater
    than for psychedelics,” said Russoniello, “because more people are incarcerated
    for those drugs than for psychedelics.” Even so, that shouldn’t mean that progress
    on decriminalizing psychedelics should get stymied by the ongoing debate over
    opioids.

    说道Russoniello，“因为更多的人因这些药物而被监禁。” 即便如此，这不应意味着在阿片类药物持续辩论的同时，非刑事化致幻剂的进展就应该受到阻碍。
