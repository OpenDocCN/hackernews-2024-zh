    in the labs of MIT’s Plasma Science and Fusion Center (PSFC), when a new type
    of magnet, made from high-temperature superconducting material, achieved a world-record
    magnetic field strength of 20 tesla for a large-scale magnet. That’s the intensity
    needed to build a fusion power plant that is expected to produce a net output
    of power and potentially usher in an era of virtually limitless power production.

    plant that produces more energy than it consumes. Such a power plant could produce

    and pressures, and since no known material could withstand such temperatures,
    the fuel must be held in place by extremely powerful magnetic fields. Producing
    such strong fields requires superconducting magnets, but all previous fusion magnets
    have been made with a superconducting material that requires frigid temperatures
    of about 4 degrees above absolute zero (4 kelvins, or -270 degrees Celsius). In
    the last few years, a newer material nicknamed REBCO, for rare-earth barium copper
    oxide, was added to fusion magnets, and allows them to operate at 20 kelvins,
    a temperature that despite being only 16 kelvins warmer, brings significant advantages

    not just a matter of substituting it in existing magnet designs. Instead, “it
    was a rework from the ground up of almost all the principles that you use to build

    different than the previous generation of superconductors. You’re not just going

    of what it takes to build a full-size thing. Our magnet development project started
    at benchtop scale and ended up at full scale in a short amount of time,” he adds,

    you have insulation between the windings, and you need insulation to deal with
    the high voltages that are generated during off-normal events such as a shutdown.”
    Eliminating the layers of insulation, he says, “has the advantage of being a low-voltage
    system. It greatly simplifies the fabrication processes and schedule.” It also

    the models agreed in their overall predictions and were well-validated by the
