- en: I walked into the interview room, and an energetic young guy (we’ll call him
    Chen) ran up to me and shook my hand frantically with both of his. He was interviewing
    for a software engineering position.

  zh: 我走进面试室，一个精力充沛的年轻人（我们称他为陈）迎上前来，用双手紧紧握住我的手。他正在面试软件工程职位。

  zh: “嗨，我是陈！”他兴高采烈地说道，“见到你我真是太高兴了！”
- en: During his interview, Chen overwhelmed me with his enthusiasm. He was open to
    feedback, asked clarifying questions, and stayed extremely upbeat. Staying upbeat
    was impressive because he could surely tell he was doing a poor job solving my
    design problem.

  zh: 在他的面试中，陈用他的热情淹没了我。他愿意接受反馈，提出澄清问题，并保持极度乐观。能保持乐观心态令人印象深刻，因为他肯定能意识到他在解决我的设计问题时表现不佳。
- en: During the final five minutes, when candidates can ask questions, Chen posed
    as many as he could fit in (I let the interview run over). He demonstrated a knowledge
    of Amazon’s business and history and explained how he would put in any energy
    necessary to be a successful part of the company.

  zh: 在最后五分钟，候选人可以提问时，陈尽可能地提出了许多问题（我让面试时间延长了）。他展示了对亚马逊业务和历史的了解，并解释了他将如何投入任何必要的精力成为公司成功一部分。
- en: When we did our debrief at the end of the interview, every interviewer had the
    same impression. Chen was below the bar on all technical measures (design, coding,
    algorithms). On the other hand, he was enthusiastic, energetic, self-critical
    about his technical gaps, and excited to hear constructive feedback, and he demonstrated
    a drive to improve himself.

  zh: 当我们在面试结束后进行总结时，每位面试官都有同样的印象。陈在所有技术指标（设计、编码、算法）上都低于标准。另一方面，他充满热情、精力充沛，对自己技术上的缺点持自我批评态度，乐于接受建设性反馈，并展现出了提升自我的动力。
- en: In leading many hundreds of Amazon interviews as both a bar-raiser and a hiring

  zh: 作为亚马逊的标杆提升者和招聘经理，我参与了数百场面试。我见过各种类型的候选人。我也看到了候选人错失机会的各种方式。
- en: When candidates prepare to interview at a company like Amazon (or Facebook,
    Google, Apple, etc.), they almost always focus on the functional aspects of the
    job. Software engineering candidates spend hours refreshing their knowledge of
    common coding questions. Designers build a beautiful portfolio of every UX they’ve
    worked on.

  zh: 当候选人准备面试亚马逊（或 Facebook、Google、Apple 等公司）时，他们几乎总是专注于工作的功能方面。软件工程候选人花费数小时刷新他们对常见编码问题的了解。设计师们则创建了一个美观的作品集，展示了他们所做的每一个用户体验设计。
- en: Soft skills don’t require the same type of preparation, but they’re just as
    essential to the interview process. Do you care about this being your career?
    Do you understand the company you’re thinking about joining? Are you able to demonstrate
    that you’ll be a great co-worker, not just a knowledgeable one?

- en: I’ve seen dozens of people fail at Amazon, and 80 percent do so because of soft
    skill issues. They fail because they’re jerks. They fail because they don’t listen
    to their co-workers. They fail because they can’t take feedback. They fail because
    they don’t handle mistakes well.

  zh: 我见过许多人在亚马逊失败，80% 的人失败是因为软技能问题。他们失败是因为他们是混蛋。他们失败是因为他们不听同事的意见。他们失败是因为他们不能接受反馈。他们失败是因为他们处理错误的能力不好。
- en: In training new bar-raisers at Amazon, we emphasize that excellent leadership
    principles are at least as important as—if not more important than—functional
    skills. While failure or success at functional skill interview questions are easier
    to judge, we insist that the loops look very carefully at the soft skills as measured
    by our leadership principles.

    encourages the team and helps drive them to do the right thing.

- en: Functional skills can be taught. Coursework, books, and experience are great
    at filling in knowledge gaps. It’s significantly harder to teach a person not
    to be offended when someone says their code needs better documentation or their
    project plan doesn’t cover important milestones. I haven’t seen a ton of success
    in teaching people empathy.

  zh: 功能技能可以教授。课程、书籍和经验非常适合填补知识空白。教会一个人不要因为有人说他们的代码需要更好的文档或者他们的项目计划没有覆盖重要的里程碑，这要困难得多。我还没有看到在教授人们同理心方面取得多大成功。
- en: Employees with soft skills provide leverage to a team. They don’t just contribute
    their work; they also improve their co-workers’ efforts. They inspire colleagues
    to stay on the team longer, which adds to institutional knowledge, improving productivity
    even more. These people are aware they can always learn more and are therefore
    open to new ideas. Soft skills are critical for growth, and in the long run, growth
    potential is more important than existing functional skills.

  zh: 具备软技能的员工为团队提供了杠杆效应。他们不仅仅是为了自己的工作贡献，还改善了同事们的努力。他们激励同事们更长时间地留在团队中，从而增加了机构知识，进一步提高了生产力。这些人意识到他们总是可以学到更多，因此他们对新思想持开放态度。软技能对于成长至关重要，从长远来看，成长潜力比现有的功能技能更重要。
- en: As I’ve [written about before](https://scarletink.substack.com/p/interviewing-at-amazon-leadership-principles),
    there are ways to demonstrate soft skills in an interview. You can show that you’ll
    not only be a skilled worker, but that others will enjoy working with you. You
    can demonstrate that you’ll not only add your functional skills to the company,
    but also improve the productivity and happiness of those around you.

- en: In our debrief for Chen, we agreed that he missed the technical bar across the
    board. On the other hand, we also agreed that we would love to work with him.
    We made him an offer. He has been at Amazon for years, has been promoted a couple
    of times, and has repeatedly demonstrated that enthusiasm and soft skills are
    powerful tools for long-term success.
