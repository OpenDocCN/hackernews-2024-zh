- en: I walked into the interview room, and an energetic young guy (we’ll call him
    Chen) ran up to me and shook my hand frantically with both of his. He was interviewing
    for a software engineering position.

    feedback, asked clarifying questions, and stayed extremely upbeat. Staying upbeat
    was impressive because he could surely tell he was doing a poor job solving my
    design problem.

    as many as he could fit in (I let the interview run over). He demonstrated a knowledge
    of Amazon’s business and history and explained how he would put in any energy
    necessary to be a successful part of the company.

- en: When we did our debrief at the end of the interview, every interviewer had the
    same impression. Chen was below the bar on all technical measures (design, coding,
    algorithms). On the other hand, he was enthusiastic, energetic, self-critical
    about his technical gaps, and excited to hear constructive feedback, and he demonstrated
    a drive to improve himself.

    manager, I’ve seen all types of candidates. I’ve also seen all the ways that candidates
    miss out on an opportunity to get hired.

- en: When candidates prepare to interview at a company like Amazon (or Facebook,
    Google, Apple, etc.), they almost always focus on the functional aspects of the
    job. Software engineering candidates spend hours refreshing their knowledge of
    common coding questions. Designers build a beautiful portfolio of every UX they’ve
    worked on.

    essential to the interview process. Do you care about this being your career?
    Do you understand the company you’re thinking about joining? Are you able to demonstrate
    that you’ll be a great co-worker, not just a knowledgeable one?

- en: I’ve seen dozens of people fail at Amazon, and 80 percent do so because of soft
    skill issues. They fail because they’re jerks. They fail because they don’t listen
    to their co-workers. They fail because they can’t take feedback. They fail because
    they don’t handle mistakes well.

- en: In training new bar-raisers at Amazon, we emphasize that excellent leadership
    principles are at least as important as—if not more important than—functional
    skills. While failure or success at functional skill interview questions are easier
    to judge, we insist that the loops look very carefully at the soft skills as measured
    by our leadership principles.

- en: A functional team is more valuable than an individual with functional skills.
    An amazingly skilled jerk does not add nearly as much value as a team member who
    encourages the team and helps drive them to do the right thing.

- en: Functional skills can be taught. Coursework, books, and experience are great
    at filling in knowledge gaps. It’s significantly harder to teach a person not
    to be offended when someone says their code needs better documentation or their
    project plan doesn’t cover important milestones. I haven’t seen a ton of success
    in teaching people empathy.

- en: Employees with soft skills provide leverage to a team. They don’t just contribute
    their work; they also improve their co-workers’ efforts. They inspire colleagues
    to stay on the team longer, which adds to institutional knowledge, improving productivity
    even more. These people are aware they can always learn more and are therefore
    open to new ideas. Soft skills are critical for growth, and in the long run, growth
    potential is more important than existing functional skills.

- en: As I’ve [written about before](https://scarletink.substack.com/p/interviewing-at-amazon-leadership-principles),
    there are ways to demonstrate soft skills in an interview. You can show that you’ll
    not only be a skilled worker, but that others will enjoy working with you. You
    can demonstrate that you’ll not only add your functional skills to the company,
    but also improve the productivity and happiness of those around you.

- en: In our debrief for Chen, we agreed that he missed the technical bar across the
    board. On the other hand, we also agreed that we would love to work with him.
    We made him an offer. He has been at Amazon for years, has been promoted a couple
    of times, and has repeatedly demonstrated that enthusiasm and soft skills are
    powerful tools for long-term success.
