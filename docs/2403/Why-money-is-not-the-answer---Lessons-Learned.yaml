    overnight. I worked full-time and tried every side hustle possible to be the next
    Elon Musk—most of the jobs I hated doing they were tedious and draining.

- en: Here is the problem with that lifestyle and way of thinking. I don’t have any
    good friends left. I didn’t bother making any meaningful connections. Because
    I thought they would slow me down. I’m still single at 37, and the idea of having
    kids and a family is gone.

    to be balanced. I don’t know if it’s because my obsessive personality stemmed
    from alcohol abuse and always wanting more. Or watching how my parents lived,
    somehow, it developed.

    doesn’t go up the more you earn. We need enough to be comfortable, not rich.

    friendships with meaningful connections.

    care about anything else if you had food and a fire. You would have fun and enjoy
    life. Nothing else would matter.

    success. Those things will never make you happy.

    good times. When you look back on your life, you will feel more fulfilled.

    if it’s your passion, you are all set. Don’t work too much, don’t work too little.
    In your spare time, chase things that make you happy; you will be better off this
    way.
