# 5-year study finds no brain abnormalities in 'Havana Syndrome' patients | CBC News

An array of advanced tests found no brain injuries or degeneration among U.S. diplomats and other government employees who suffer mysterious health problems once dubbed "Havana syndrome," researchers reported Monday.

The National Institutes of Health's (NIH) nearly five-year study offers no explanation for symptoms including headaches, balance problems and difficulties with thinking and sleep that were first reported in Cuba in 2016 and later by hundreds of American personnel in multiple countries.

But it did contradict some earlier findings that raised the spectre of brain injuries in people experiencing what the State Department now calls "anomalous health incidents."

"These individuals have real symptoms and are going through a very tough time," said Dr. Leighton Chan, NIH's chief of rehabilitation medicine, who helped lead the research. "They can be quite profound, disabling and difficult to treat."

Yet sophisticated MRI scans detected no significant differences in brain volume, structure or white matter — signs of injury or degeneration — when Havana syndrome patients were compared to healthy government workers with similar jobs, including some in the same embassy.

Nor were there significant differences in cognitive and other tests, according [to findings](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2816532) published in the Journal of the American Medical Association.

***WATCH l Canadian response to illnesses slower than that of U.S. counterparts (2019):***  ### Havana Syndrome: Investigating what made the diplomats sick

Jayme Poisson digs into a new Canadian study that tries to solve the mystery of what caused dozens of Canadian and US diplomats in Cuba to become sick.

The findings are the latest in an effort to unravel a mystery that began when personnel at the U.S. Embassy in Cuba began seeking medical care for hearing loss and ear-ringing after reporting sudden weird noises.

After several Canadians in Cuba also reported illnesses, Global Affairs Canada also grew concerned, commissioning a clinical study by a team of multidisciplinary researchers in Halifax, affiliated with the Brain Repair Centre, Dalhousie University and the Nova Scotia Health Authority. A study posited that neurotoxic agents used in pesticide fumigation could be a factor in some of the symptoms experienced.

"On behalf of all counsel involved, acting for both U.S. and Canadian diplomats, we are extremely disappointed in the NIH review," co-counsel Paul Miller of Toronto's Howie, Sacks & Henry LLP [said in a statement](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/canadian-diplomats-dispute-havana-study-findings-302092009.html). "Our clients, who continue to suffer from injuries suffered in Havana and elsewhere, call on both the Canadian and U.S. governments to provide transparency to those impacted by Havana Syndrome."

## Concerns about foreign adversaries

Early on, there was concern that Russia or another country may have used some form of directed energy to attack Americans.

Mark S. Zaid, counsel for several American diplomats, said in a statement late Monday that, "The absence of evidence is not evidence and these studies therefore do nothing to undermine the theory that a foreign adversary is harming U.S. personnel and their families with a form of directed energy." He [raised concerns with how the study was conducted](https://x.com/MarkSZaidEsq/status/1769758529819185247?s=20) and with one of the authors' previous work in a Department of Defence agency.

Last year, U.S. intelligence agencies said there was no sign a foreign adversary was involved and that most cases appeared to have different causes, from undiagnosed illnesses to environmental factors.

While that couldn't rule out some transient injury when symptoms began, researchers said it's good news that they couldn't spot long-term markers on brain scans that are typical after trauma or stroke.

That "should be some reassurance for patients," said study co-author Louis French, a neuropsychologist at Walter Reed National Military Medical Centre in Maryland. "It allows us to focus on the here and now, to getting people back to where they should be."

## Balance issues significant for some

A subset of study participants, about 28 per cent, of Havana syndrome cases were diagnosed with a balance problem called persistent postural-perceptual dizziness, or PPPD. Linked to inner-ear problems as well as severe stress, it results when certain brain networks show no injury but don't communicate properly. French called it a "maladaptive response," much like how people who've slouched to alleviate back pain can have posture trouble even after the pain is gone.

The Havana syndrome participants reported more fatigue, posttraumatic stress symptoms and depression.

Some patients have accused the government of dismissing their ailments. And in [an editorial](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2816534) in the medical journal JAMA on Monday, one scientist called for more research to prepare for the next such health mystery, cautioning that NIH's study design plus the limits of existing medical technology could have missed some clues.

"One might suspect that nothing or nothing serious happened with these cases. This would be ill-advised," wrote Dr. David Relman of Stanford University. In 2022, he was part of a government-appointed panel that couldn't rule out that a pulsed form of energy could explain a subset of cases.

The NIH study, which began in 2018 and included more than 80 Havana syndrome patients, wasn't designed to examine the likelihood of some weapon or other trigger for Havana syndrome symptoms.

Chan said the findings don't contradict the intelligence agencies' conclusions. If some "external phenomenon" was behind the symptoms, "it did not result in persistent or detectable pathophysiologic change," he said.
