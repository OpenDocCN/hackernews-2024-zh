- en: The “Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act”
    would give the President the power to designate an application under the control
    of a country considered adversarial to the U.S. to be a national security threat.
    TikTok would be deemed a threat, meaning that the application would effectively
    be banned unless it cuts all ties with the foreign adversarial country within
    180 days through a forced sale. The same could be true for other applications,
    like WeChat.

- en: It’s a massive problem that current US law allows for all the big social media
    platforms to harvest and monetize our personal data, including TikTok. Without
    comprehensive data privacy legislation, this will continue, and this ban won’t
    solve any real or perceived problems. User data will still be collected by numerous
    platforms and sold to data brokers who sell it to the highest bidder—including
    governments of countries such as China—just as it is now.

- en: TikTok raises special concerns, given the surveillance and censorship practices
    of the country that its parent company is based in, China. But it’s also used
    by hundreds of millions of people to express themselves online, and is an instrumental
    tool for community building and holding those in power accountable. The US government
    has not justified silencing the speech of Americans who use TikTok, nor has it
    justified the indirect speech punishment of a forced sale (which may prove difficult
    if not impossible to accomplish in the required timeframe). It can’t meet the
    high constitutional bar for a restriction on the platform, which would undermine
    the free speech and association rights of millions of people. This bill must be
    stopped.
