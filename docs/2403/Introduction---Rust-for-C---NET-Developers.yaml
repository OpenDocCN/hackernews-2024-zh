- en: This is a (non-comprehensive) guide for C# and .NET developers that are completely
    new to the Rust programming language. Some concepts and constructs translate fairly
    well between C#/.NET and Rust, but which may be expressed differently, whereas
    others are a radical departure, like memory management. This guide provides a
    brief comparison and mapping of those constructs and concepts with concise examples.

    completely new to Rust. This guide is the compilation of the knowledge acquired
    by the authors writing Rust code over the course of several months. It is the
    guide the authors wish they had when they started on their Rust journey. That
    said, the authors would encourage you to read books and other material available
    on the Web to embrace Rust and its idioms rather than attempting to learn it exclusively
    through the lens of C# and .NET. Meanwhile, this guide can help answers some question
    quickly, like: *Does Rust support inheritance, threading, asynchronous programming,
    etc.?*'
