    [erectile dysfunction](/topic/erectile-dysfunction) in men, researchers have said.

- en: A study of more than 200,000 men indicates that for every additional 1.2 hours
    spent using a computer, the chances of experiencing erectile dysfunction increased
    by 3.57 times.

    genetic tendency for leisure computer use.

    of follicle-stimulating hormone in men, which stimulates the production of sperm.

    activities such as watching television or driving for leisure increased the risk
    of erectile dysfunction.

    use and erectile dysfunction risk.

    caused by computer use has not been clarified in the present study, the damage
    of sedentary behaviour to erectile function appears to be clear, which needs to
    attract public attention.'

    association studies, where genes linked to a particular condition or trait, such
    as risk of sedentary behaviour, are identified.

    described it as “quite a neat but complicated study” exploring the possible contributory
    factors which may lead to erectile dysfunction.

    time was associated with an increased risk of erectile dysfunction.

    in these men.

    of sperm, it’s effect on erectile function is less clear and the authors of the
    study suggest this is a new avenue for investigation.

    that men who are worried about their erectile function should perhaps get off
    the computer and become more active.
