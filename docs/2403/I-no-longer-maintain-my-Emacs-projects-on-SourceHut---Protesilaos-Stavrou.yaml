    I am now undoing that decision. My code is on GitLab and GitHub, with the latter
    as the de facto primary source.'

- en: The SourceHut web interface does not show any kind of indication that a message
    has an attachment. Last time I tried it, I had to download an mbox file and extract
    the patch from there. This was helped by the fact that I knew what I was searching
    for, but the experience was not pleasant anyway.

- en: Many users are reluctant to subscribe to my project’s mailing list and instead
    email me directly. This is fine, as I do get the work done eventually, but it
    beats the point of having a public inbox if I am the only one who reads those
    messages anyway.

    filters. I cannot easily go from “personal” to “packages” and thus have trouble
    prioritising tasks.

- en: Users replying to mailing list threads frequently do not “reply to all”, so
    the filter I have for SourceHut lists does not apply and my inbox is noisy again.

- en: Coordinating work between my “official” SourceHut-based repository and the de
    facto GitHub one is a problem, because a user on one may not be aware of what
    a user on the other is doing.

    so I will not list them here.

    Git forges. But this is a task that requires knowledge and resources. So it will
    not happen soon.
