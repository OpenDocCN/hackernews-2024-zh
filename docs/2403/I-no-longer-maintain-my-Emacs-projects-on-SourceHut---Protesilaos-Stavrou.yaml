    I am now undoing that decision. My code is on GitLab and GitHub, with the latter
    as the de facto primary source.'

- en: The SourceHut web interface does not show any kind of indication that a message
    has an attachment. Last time I tried it, I had to download an mbox file and extract
    the patch from there. This was helped by the fact that I knew what I was searching
    for, but the experience was not pleasant anyway.

    email me directly. This is fine, as I do get the work done eventually, but it
    beats the point of having a public inbox if I am the only one who reads those
    messages anyway.

    a user on the other is doing.
