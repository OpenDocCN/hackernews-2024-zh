    in the EU as part of our efforts to comply with the DMA. The need to remove the
    capability was informed by the complex security and privacy concerns associated
    with web apps to support alternative browser engines that would require building
    a new integration architecture that does not currently exist in iOS.

    capability in the EU. This support means Home Screen web apps continue to be built

    and privacy model for native apps on iOS.
