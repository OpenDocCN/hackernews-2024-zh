- en: Manual pages are the canonical type of documentation for Unix systems. They
    are a bit arcane, but for a technology several decades old, they've held up quite
    well. The arcane bit is the markup language. This is a brief tutorial on writing
    good manual pages, at least for the typical cases. You'll be assumed to be familiar
    with reading manual pages already.

- en: There are actually many ways to produce manual pages. The **`man`(1)** command
    needs a file using **`troff`(1)** formatting commands. [`troff`](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troff)
    is a typesetting system from the 1970s, written by the Unix developers. The `troff`
    file can be written manually, or generated from other formats, such as DocBook
    or Perl POD markup. On Linux, `groff`, the GNU implementation of `troff`, is used.

    show that as underline), and `.R` in what `troff` calls the roman font, and the
    rest of us call the normal font. You can combine these, `.BR` typesets the first
    word on the line in bold, the second in normal font. The output will have no space
    between the words: `.BR manpagename (7)` would be the usual way to refer to another
    manual page. If a word has spaces in it, use double quotes: `.B "far and away"`
    for example.'

- en: An unfortunate bit of arcane syntax is that dashes in options should be prefixed
    by backslashes. Thus, write `\-\-bits`, not just `--bits`. The Debian and Ubuntu
    implementation of `man` treats them the same, for terminal output, but this is
    not portable. Technically a naked `-` means a hyphen, whereas `\-` means a minus
    sign. Typographically these are distinct, and they are also distinct in Unicode.
    The typesetter is free to break a line at a hyphen, but not at a minus. For dashes
    in options, you should thus use minuses, but in normal text, for normal words,
    the hyphen.
