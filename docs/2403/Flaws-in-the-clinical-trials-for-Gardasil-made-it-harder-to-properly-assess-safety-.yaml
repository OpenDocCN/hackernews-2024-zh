    Merck said it was “confident” in Gardasil’s safety profile, which “was established

    she was accused of being a drug addict. The year after she was vaccinated, she
    developed severe pains that forced her to use a wheelchair for a while; today
    she regularly uses crutches. Doctors have told her she might have psoriatic arthritis,
    but she never received a definite diagnosis. More than a dozen years later, “I

    headaches, and a profound fatigue that often made her miss school. “My mom and

    according to Dr. Jose Montoya, a professor of medicine at Stanford University
    and a CFS expert. The condition usually starts with an insult to the immune system—a
    severe infection, a car crash, a pregnancy. The first symptoms are flu-like, but
    months go by and the patient realizes she isn’t getting better. In a few genetically
    predisposed individuals, Montoya told me, it is “biologically plausible” that
    the vaccine, which mimics a natural infection, could also trigger an immune response
    powerful enough to lead to CFS. To find out if that is the case, trial investigators
    would need to carefully track participants’ symptoms “for at least one year,”
    he said.

- en: 'Montoya was also quick to tell me that he is “pro-vaccine,” and he doesn’t
    think people should stop getting them. His eagerness to make that point underscores
    a larger issue with unpacking the shortcomings of Merck’s research: Acknowledging

    is not an absolute. Like drugs, vaccines are a varied lot, each with its own set
    of risks and benefits that relate to its particular use in particular individuals.
    And unfortunately, our knowledge about side effects is often woefully incomplete.
    To Lemmens, the University of Toronto bioethicist, the reluctance to have a frank
    discussion about the safety of Gardasil is counterproductive. “We do a disservice

    9疫苗的三名女孩被诊断为POTS，还有一名被诊断为CRPS。Chandler在她的2014年评估中写道，还有几例“有趣的”神经系统疾病。但这些疾病并未被公司报告为不良事件；相反，它们都被标记为Merck研究协议中的新医疗史。

    research institution in Sweden, told me she “argued quite much” about her findings
    at the agency, “because I was very concerned that the study design was not appropriate
    to pick up these things.” Her regulatory colleagues apparently shared her apprehension,
    laying out their misgivings in a series of confidential EMA reports leading up
    to the approval of Gardasil 9\. (I obtained these reports from Läkemedelsverket
    through several freedom-of-information requests.) One confidential EMA report
    from 2014 called Merck’s approach to safety “an unconventional and suboptimal
    study procedure”; another observed that the design “brings some degree of uncertainty
    into the overall safety assessment.”

    how Merck dealt with safety, despite considering it “a systemic issue related
    to study design and as such not an inspection finding.” The unorthodox design
    “complicated” the reporting of adverse events, the inspectors wrote, in part because

- en: On a rainy day in September, I flew with Lyng to Berlin to visit Gerd Wallukat,
    a scientist at the biotech startup Berlin Cures. Wallukat, a heavyset man in his
    mid-70s, has pioneered research into a special class of autoantibodies—proteins
    made by the immune system that attack the body’s own cells instead of foreign
    invaders like viruses or bacteria. Researchers have been finding these “agonistic
    autoantibodies” in people with different diseases, including CFS, POTS, and CRPS,
    but their role is not fully understood. Berlin Cures is in the middle of [early-stage
    trials](https://berlincures.de/pipeline/) to see if neutralizing them could have
    a therapeutic effect.

  zh: 在九月的一个雨天，我和Lyng飞往柏林，拜访了柏林治疗公司的生物技术初创企业科学家Gerd Wallukat。Wallukat是一位七十多岁的中年男子，他开创了对特殊类别的自身抗体研究——这些由免疫系统产生的蛋白质攻击身体自身的细胞，而不是像病毒或细菌等外来入侵者。研究人员在患有不同疾病的人群中发现了这些“激动性自身抗体”，包括慢性疲劳综合征（CFS）、POTS和CRPS，但它们的作用尚不完全了解。柏林治疗公司正在进行[早期试验](https://berlincures.de/pipeline/)，以查看中和这些抗体是否可能产生治疗效果。
- en: One of Lyng’s doctors in Denmark had been working with Wallukat to look for
    autoantibodies in girls and women who fell ill following Gardasil vaccination.
    Their preliminary, unpublished findings suggested that nearly all of these women
    harbor one or more agonistic autoantibodies, and Wallukat had offered to test
    Lyng, too. On the plane, she was nervous and chatty. She didn’t want to be sick,
    she explained, but it was taxing having to convince people around her—her caseworker,
    her family, even her husband—that she was physically sick while one test after
    another came up empty. She dreaded the thought of receiving yet another negative
    result.

    to three types of autoantibodies, “the classical pattern I’ve seen in patients
    after vaccination.” From a coffee shop, Lyng called her husband. “I’m completely
    overwhelmed. It’s the first time I’ve had a positive result,” she told him. “This
    means it’s not just in my head—all those doctors who’ve asked if it could be psychological.”

- en: 'But Lyng’s positive test triggers more questions than it answers: What induced
    those autoantibodies, and how? Did they cause her symptoms, as her doctor speculated?
    And would neutralizing them bring about improvement, as Berlin Cures wagered?
    The test brought another piece to the puzzle that is Lyng’s case; but as so often
    happens in science, it did not bring certainty, and it proved nothing in the way
    of causality. Should it turn out that Gardasil does have serious side effects,
    it’s apparent that they must be rare. What’s more, the vaccine might still be
    worth that hypothetical risk—cervical cancer, though uncommon, is a terrible disease.'

    the American psychologist Brian Nosek, “Science isn’t about truth and falsity,
    it’s about reducing uncertainty.” Not owning up to that uncertainty, when it is
