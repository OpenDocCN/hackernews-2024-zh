    Merck said it was “confident” in Gardasil’s safety profile, which “was established

- en: Imagining a link between HPV vaccination and CFS is not all that far-fetched,
    according to Dr. Jose Montoya, a professor of medicine at Stanford University
    and a CFS expert. The condition usually starts with an insult to the immune system—a
    severe infection, a car crash, a pregnancy. The first symptoms are flu-like, but
    months go by and the patient realizes she isn’t getting better. In a few genetically
    predisposed individuals, Montoya told me, it is “biologically plausible” that
    the vaccine, which mimics a natural infection, could also trigger an immune response
    powerful enough to lead to CFS. To find out if that is the case, trial investigators
    would need to carefully track participants’ symptoms “for at least one year,”
    he said.

  zh: 根据斯坦福大学医学教授、CFS专家何塞·蒙托亚博士的说法，想象HPV疫苗和慢性疲劳综合征之间存在联系并非那么牵强。这种情况通常始于对免疫系统的打击——严重感染、车祸、怀孕等。最初的症状类似流感，但几个月过去了，患者意识到自己并没有好转。蒙托亚告诉我，在少数基因易感者中，“生物学上是有可能的”，疫苗模拟自然感染，也可能引发足以导致CFS的免疫反应。他说，要弄清楚是否存在这种情况，试验研究者需要仔细跟踪参与者的症状，“至少一年”。

    think people should stop getting them. His eagerness to make that point underscores
    a larger issue with unpacking the shortcomings of Merck’s research: Acknowledging
    any uncertainty around the safety of vaccination can be a difficult exercise for
    health authorities, not least because of the [debunked autism scare](https://doi.org/10.1136/bmj.c5347)

    is not an absolute. Like drugs, vaccines are a varied lot, each with its own set

    To Lemmens, the University of Toronto bioethicist, the reluctance to have a frank
    discussion about the safety of Gardasil is counterproductive. “We do a disservice

    happens in science, it did not bring certainty, and it proved nothing in the way
    of causality. Should it turn out that Gardasil does have serious side effects,
    it’s apparent that they must be rare. What’s more, the vaccine might still be
    worth that hypothetical risk—cervical cancer, though uncommon, is a terrible disease.'

    in progress. To borrow [the words](https://qz.com/638059/many-scientific-truths-are-in-fact-false/) of
    the American psychologist Brian Nosek, “Science isn’t about truth and falsity,
    it’s about reducing uncertainty.” Not owning up to that uncertainty, when it is
    legitimate, likely will only slow scientific progress. In the controversial realm
    of vaccines, it will also create fodder for conspiracy theorists spreading overblown
    or unfounded fears among an already distrustful public.

    body of research and to welcome discussion about what we know and don’t know,
    according to Lemmens, the bioethicist.

    trust in the provision of medication and public-health planning,” he told me.
    Instead, as confidence in Gardasil nosedived in Denmark, regulators doubled down
    on the simplistic message that the vaccine has been [thoroughly tested](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qF7pBzU4D20) and
    is unquestionably safe.

    Danish Health Authority and an OB-GYN, told journalists that “for us, as authorities,
    there is no doubt about this vaccine’s efficacy and safety.” This seems to contradict
    the EMA’s own deliberations about the way Merck reported safety data in its trials. As
    Dr. Christian Gluud, who heads the Copenhagen Trial Unit, a research center at
    Copenhagen University Hospital, told me recently, “If we had tested our vaccines
    properly, we wouldn’t be having the discussion we’re having now.”
