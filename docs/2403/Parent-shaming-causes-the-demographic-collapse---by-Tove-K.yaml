    wanted to raise fertility, they could start by saying “having children is good”.
    And they don't. They only say things that mean “having children is good provided
    you are a, b, c, and d.” Married, employed, mature, psychologically stable, you
    name it. Everybody knows that if you can't live up to a certain minimum standard,
    having children is a bad thing. That minimum standard is very vaguely formulated,
    but most would agree it has been creeping upwards for the last fifty years, putting
    ever more prospective parents in the potential zone of shame.

    Western societies. But there is one exception: Parents. Since they don''t act
    as individuals, but are responsible for the wellbeing of other individuals, parents
    are legitimate objects of shame. All moralists know this. Whoever feels like shaming
    some group of people, is likely to pick parents who are not good enough one way
    or another. In itself, this makes people anxious not to have children before they
    have assembled enough social capital to parry all or most shameful situations.
    This probably explains a good deal of the increase in the age of new parents.'

    will not be shameful parents in some way. If they choose to have children when
    close to the shaming threshold, they risk falling below it by some accident and
    become shameful parents. If they are cautious, they wait for another few years
    in order to be more sure not to become shameful. After all, there is no shame
    in waiting. There is also no shame in having only one or two children or in having
    no children at all. So for people who are anxious over their social status, the
    choice is clear - they should err on the infertile side.

- en: Praising people for having children is both an old concept and a new concept.
    People have never really been outrightly praised for having children - they have
    been praised for fulfilling a certain social role based on a certain kind of sexual
    behavior. There is no need to go back to that system. What deserves praise is
    the act of taking care of children in itself. To solve the problem with low fertility
    once and for all the Western world needs a whole new cultural mindset. A mindset
    where the social risk of children is significantly less than the praise parents
    receive for them.
