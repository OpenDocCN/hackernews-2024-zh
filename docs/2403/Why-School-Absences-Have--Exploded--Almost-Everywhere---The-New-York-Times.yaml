    in part by working with families to address the specific reasons a student is
    missing school, but also by establishing a relationship with a caring adult. Other
    efforts — such as [sending text messages](https://www.edweek.org/leadership/want-to-tackle-chronic-absenteeism-try-texting-parents/2022/01)
    or postcards to parents informing them of the number of accumulated absences —
    can also be effective.
