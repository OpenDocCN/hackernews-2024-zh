- en: The Power Iteration algorithm, also known as the Von Mises iteration, is a simple
    yet powerful tool in linear algebra. It is used to compute the dominant eigenvector
    of a matrix and its corresponding eigenvalue. The algorithm has a wide range of
    applications from physics and engineering to computer science, including image
    analysis, spectral graph theory, and Google's PageRank algorithm.

    eigenvalues and eigenvectors are. Given a square matrix \(\mathbf{A}\), a non-zero
    vector \(\mathbf{v}\) is an eigenvector of \(\mathbf{A}\) if it satisfies the
    following equation:'

    \(\mathbf{v}\). The intuition is that multiplication by \(\mathbf{A}\) only changes
    the magnitude (by a factor of \(\lambda\)) and possibly the direction of the vector
    \(\mathbf{v}\) but does not change the space in which \(\mathbf{v}\) lies.

    especially for large, sparse matrices. However, it does have some limitations.
    It can only find the largest (in absolute value) eigenvalue, and it can be slow
    to converge for certain matrices.
