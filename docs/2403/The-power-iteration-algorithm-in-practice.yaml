- en: The Power Iteration algorithm, also known as the Von Mises iteration, is a simple
    yet powerful tool in linear algebra. It is used to compute the dominant eigenvector
    of a matrix and its corresponding eigenvalue. The algorithm has a wide range of
    applications from physics and engineering to computer science, including image
    analysis, spectral graph theory, and Google's PageRank algorithm.

    eigenvalues and eigenvectors are. Given a square matrix \(\mathbf{A}\), a non-zero
    vector \(\mathbf{v}\) is an eigenvector of \(\mathbf{A}\) if it satisfies the
    following equation:'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Here, \(\lambda\) is a scalar known as the eigenvalue corresponding to the eigenvector
    \(\mathbf{v}\). The intuition is that multiplication by \(\mathbf{A}\) only changes
    the magnitude (by a factor of \(\lambda\)) and possibly the direction of the vector
    \(\mathbf{v}\) but does not change the space in which \(\mathbf{v}\) lies.

    the Power Iteration method. The algorithm is based on a simple, yet profound,
    idea: if you start with a random vector, multiply it by the matrix repeatedly,
    and normalize it at each step, the vector will converge to the dominant eigenvector
    of the matrix.'

    Normalizing the vector at each step ensures that the algorithm doesn't diverge.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Once the algorithm converges, the corresponding eigenvalue can be calculated
    by rearranging the equation \(\mathbf{A}\mathbf{v} = \lambda \mathbf{v}\) to yield
    \(\lambda = \frac{\mathbf{v}^H\mathbf{A}\mathbf{v} }{\mathbf{v}^H \mathbf{v}}\).

- en: The power iteration method is easy to implement and can be remarkably effective,
    especially for large, sparse matrices. However, it does have some limitations.
    It can only find the largest (in absolute value) eigenvalue, and it can be slow
    to converge for certain matrices.

    between `b_k1` and `b_k`. If the difference is less than a small tolerance (in

    been achieved. Finally, it computes the corresponding eigenvalue `lambda_k` and
    returns the dominant eigenvector `b_k1` and its corresponding eigenvalue.
