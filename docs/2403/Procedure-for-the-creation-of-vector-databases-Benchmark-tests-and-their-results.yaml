- en: A vector is a mathematical object that can be represented as an ordered collection
    of numbers, called components, that correspond to the extent of the vector along
    different coordinate axes. In two-dimensional space (a plane), a vector can be
    represented as (x,y), where x and y are the components along the horizontal and
    vertical axes, respectively. In three-dimensional space, a vector can be represented
    as (x,y,z), with components along the x, y and z axes. There are many ways to
    define a concept of similarity between a pair of vectors (Euclidean distance and
    cosine similarity are two examples). Euclidean distance generalises our natural
    concept of the distance between two points on a plane (#pythagoreantheorem), while
    cosine similarity captures the idea that two vectors are similar if they point
    in roughly the same direction.

- en: The power of vector databases is unlocked when the stored vectors are obtained
    as semantic embeddings of their associated metadata, and the similarity between
    two vectors captures the concept of semantic proximity of the metadata. If the
    metadata is natural language, this can be achieved using an embedding algorithm
    such as word2vec or a large language model such as Aleph Alpha's Luminous or the
    OpenAI GPT models.

- en: It is important to note that the answers to the second question should always
    be seen in the light of the accuracy of the approximation. After all, the worse
    an approximation is allowed to be, the easier it is to derive it quickly. When
    optimising the accuracy of the similarity search, one often has to carefully adjust
    parameters that can strongly influence the time consumption of both the upload
    and the search, and whose choice is highly dependent on the structure of the underlying
    dataset. Therefore, in order to keep the parameter space for our benchmark test
    manageable, we focus on investigating the above issues without optimising for
    similarity search accuracy.

    capabilities, which have previously been monopolised by a few major tech companies.
    The company's software gives customers the option to run it on their infrastructure,
    allowing them to maintain control of their data behind their firewalls. The company
    also offers a managed cloud service, Weaviate Cloud, which provides additional
    flexibility for organisations that prefer a cloud-based approach to data management.
