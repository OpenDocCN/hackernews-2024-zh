- en: '**Kate**: Okay, so let me set the scene here for what we hope this conversation
    will cover. And James, feel free to chime in. At re:Invent, Dan, James and I spent
    some time palling around the Venetian looking for the best vendor sponsored lunch,
    as you do, and we got to talking about Hacker News and its place in the Devrel
    community. So the motive for this is that Dan is active on Hacker News. And James
    and I, not so much. And I know it’s Dan because instead of using an incognito
    pseudonym, he uses the same handle as his Twitter account, or X, if you prefer.
    So I mentioned not only that I see his posts often, but also that we appreciate
    whenever Dan posts James or my blog posts on Hacker News, which he’s done a couple
    of times. So does that sound about right, James?'
  id: totrans-split-12
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: '**Kate**: 好的，让我为我们希望讨论的场景做个铺垫。James，随时加入讨论。在re:Invent期间，Dan、James和我花了一些时间在威尼斯人酒店周围寻找最好的供应商赞助午餐，就像你们一样，我们开始谈论Hacker
    News及其在Devrel社区中的地位。因此，这次讨论的动机是因为Dan在Hacker News上非常活跃。而我和James则不太活跃。我知道是Dan，因为他没有用假名，而是用了和他Twitter账号相同的用户名，或者如果你更喜欢的话，就是X。所以我不仅提到我经常看到他的帖子，还提到我们很感激Dan多次在Hacker
    News上发布了James或者我的博客文章。这样说对吗，James？'
- en: '**James Governor**: Yeah, I think that’s a great summary of where we are. I
    mean, the simple fact is, I’d say, here we are. It’s 2024\. Hacker News, it’s
    an interesting one, because on the one hand, there are a lot of people like, oh,
    there are some bad behaviors associated with the network and some sort of complaints
    and so on. But for anyone that is trying to get developers to adopt their tools,
    that is trying to communicate with developers, they all want to be on Hacker News.
    On the one hand it’s like, oh, it sucks. And on the other hand, it’s like, no,
    it’s great. It’s a great, great tool. I mean, arguably, Twitter is the same. Oh,
    Twitter is terrible. But it still remains actually quite a good tool. And I think
    that certainly from my perspective, it is an incredibly useful resource, even
    if there are some assholes on the network. So, assholes aside, I think that investment
    in time and the question of why you would invest in that is something that Dan,
    I know, has done. During lockdown, he was nice enough to come to — I have a little
    community called flyless, and he gave a great talk to that community about why
    and how it was worth investing that time in Hacker News.'

  zh: '**James Governor**: 是的，我认为这是我们目前所处的一个很好的总结。我的意思是，我会说，我们在这里。现在是2024年。Hacker
    News，这是一个有趣的问题，因为一方面，很多人会说，哦，与该网络相关的行为有些不好，还有一些抱怨之类的东西。但是对于任何试图让开发者采用他们的工具，试图与开发者沟通的人来说，他们都希望出现在
    Hacker News 上。一方面像是，哦，这很糟糕。另一方面，没有，这很棒。这是一个很棒的工具。我认为，可以说，Twitter 也是一样。哦，Twitter
    很糟糕。但事实上它仍然是一个相当好的工具。从我的角度来看，它确实是一个非常有用的资源，即使网络上有些混蛋。所以，撇开混蛋不谈，我认为在 Hacker News
    上投资时间以及为什么要投资时间的问题，我知道 Dan 在这方面做过一些工作。在封锁期间，他很好心地来到 —— 我有一个小社区叫 flyless，他给这个社区做了一个很棒的演讲，说明了为什么以及如何在
    Hacker News 上投入时间是值得的。'
- en: So, yeah, I was just keen to capture that, because as I say, everybody wants
    to get that — everyone wants that conversation on Hacker News. But then they’re
    like, how do we get this? Is there a way we can game this? What are the opportunities
    there? Dan knows all of the things. And so I’ll shut up and be like, Dan, you
    know, is that right? Why do you feel it’s worth investing your time in Hacker
    News?
  id: totrans-split-14
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 所以，是的，我很想捕捉到这一点，因为我要说的是，每个人都想要那个 —— 每个人都希望在 Hacker News 上有那个讨论。但是然后他们会想，我们怎么做到这一点？有没有方法可以操纵这个？那里面有什么机会？Dan
    知道所有这些。所以我会闭嘴，然后说，Dan，你知道吗？你为什么觉得值得花时间投入在 Hacker News 上呢？
- en: '**Dan**: Sure. I mean, the first thing I’d say is, I actually saw a couple
    of weeks ago, I think, somebody advertising for a Devrel that was just focused
    on Hacker News. Like that was only thing that they were going to be doing, which
    to me seems counterproductive, but indicates that there is a desire and demand
    out there for this. I mean, I guess I would start with, well, I guess the first
    question is, how familiar are your listeners with Hacker News at all? Do they
    know?'
  id: totrans-split-15
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: '**Dan**: 当然。我是说，我几周前看到过，我想是几周前，有人在招聘 Devrel，专注于 Hacker News。就是他们要做的唯一的事情，这对我来说似乎是适得其反的，但这表明外界确实对此有需求和需求。我想我会从这里开始，好吧，我想第一个问题是，你的听众对
    Hacker News 有多熟悉？他们了解吗？'
- en: '**Kate**: I think we should lay a foundation. Yeah. So what is Hacker News,
    and why do we care about it?'
  id: totrans-split-16
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: '**Kate**: 我觉得我们应该打下基础。对啊。那么，什么是 Hacker News，为什么我们关心它呢？'
- en: '**Dan**: Sure, sure. Yeah. So Hacker News is basically a link sharing and discussion
    website. And speaking of being in the 2020s, it looks like it was written in the
    2000s. And its text only, very bare bones. You can sign up for an account, you
    can also read it anonymously. Those are your choices. And then when you sign up
    for account, you can submit links and you can upvote links or down vote. Uh, can’t
    downvote links. And then you can comment on them. So with comments, you can upvote
    a comment or downvote a comment, or you can just add your own comments. So it
    really is more like a, like an old school bulletin board. And the reason why it’s
    so attractive is both the audience, there’s a ton of, especially, well, it was
    founded by the same people who did Y Combinator. They actually did Y Combinator
    after Hacker News. Paul Graham did. And so Y Combinator folks are still very prevalent
    on there. There’s a really heavy tech focus, and it’s hard to find exact traffic
    numbers, but there’s about 10 million users. And I have had some posts go to the
    top of Hacker News, and they get like 20 or 30,000 visits kind of thing.'
  id: totrans-split-17
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: '**丹**：当然，当然。是的。Hacker News 基本上是一个链接分享和讨论的网站。说到进入2020年代，它看起来像是在2000年代编写的。它只有文本，非常简陋。你可以注册一个账号，也可以匿名阅读。这些都是你的选择。当你注册账号后，你可以提交链接，可以点赞或者踩链接。啊，不能踩链接。然后你可以对它们进行评论。所以在评论中，你可以点赞或者踩评论，或者只是添加你自己的评论。所以它确实更像是一个老式的公告板。它之所以如此吸引人的原因在于观众，特别是它是由做
    Y Combinator 的同一群人创立的。实际上，是 Paul Graham 在 Hacker News 之后做了 Y Combinator。因此，Y Combinator
    的人在那里仍然非常活跃。有着非常浓厚的科技关注度，虽然确切的流量数据很难找到，但大约有1000万用户。我曾经发过一些帖子登上过 Hacker News 的首页，然后就会有20或30,000次的访问量之类的事情。'
- en: So it’s a fair amount of traffic and it’s very concentrated. I can talk later
    about what that traffic actually looks like and kind of what the benefits are
    of having a page, a post go there, but that’s basically it. And what else do I
    have? It’s lightly moderated. There’s a couple of humans there who actually will
    respond to email, or I’ve gotten a couple emails from them. I actually pitched
    them on coming and talking to that group James, that you talked about, they said
    no, but they at least responded to the email. And then there’s a lot of auto moderation
    too. So there’s definitely some rules around this. And I like to think of it like
    a community, just like you or I would react negatively or we probably do react
    negatively when someone comes, knocks on the door in our house and wants to sell
    us something. Hacker News is the same way. It’s really an online community and
    if you want things to go well for you there, you want to treat it like that. You
    don’t want to just treat it as a dumping ground for your links.
  id: totrans-split-18
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 所以这是相当多的流量，而且非常集中。我稍后可以谈谈那个流量实际上是什么样子，以及帖子登上那里的好处，但基本上就是这样。还有什么？它的管理程度相对宽松。那里有一些人类会实际上回复电子邮件，或者我收到过几封来自他们的邮件。我实际上向他们提出了来和你提到的那个
    James 的小组交流的建议，他们拒绝了，但至少回复了邮件。然后也有很多自动管理。所以在这方面肯定是有一些规则的。我喜欢把它看作一个社区，就像你我会对有人来敲我们家门想要卖东西时产生负面反应一样。Hacker
    News 也是如此。它真的是一个在线社区，如果你希望在那里顺利，你需要像对待一个社区一样对待它。你不希望把它当成你的链接转发地。
- en: '**James**: Yeah, I think that’s the thing. I mean it just, we have that whole
    thing about like Devrel or dev marketing. And as I said, anybody that is launching
    a developer or infrastructure related product is definitely going to want to,
    in an ideal world, be featured on Hacker News, front page, whatever. But you can’t
    treat it as marketing in the sense that, yeah, you can’t just show up and be like,
    and pitch. And that’s the same as frankly any good tech conference. Nobody wants
    to see a pitch, they want somebody to be like, oh, here’s an interesting thing.
    This is what we built with it. This is what we did with it. In that sense, to
    put about it being community is, it is a little bit like, you know, it has some
    affinities with what you would want from a good conference in that, hopefully.
    Except there are a bunch of people that are very willing to just shout, no, you’re
    a goober.'
  id: totrans-split-19

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: '**James**: 是的，我认为这就是问题所在。我的意思是，我们有关于开发者关系或开发者营销的整个事情。正如我所说的，任何推出开发者或基础设施相关产品的人绝对会希望在黑客新闻上被推荐到首页，无论如何。但你不能把它当作营销来对待，就像任何好的技术会议一样。没有人想看到一个推销，他们希望有人能说，“哦，这里有个有趣的东西。这是我们用它建造的。这是我们用它做的。”从这个意义上说，谈到它作为社区的内容，它有点像你希望从一个好的会议中得到的东西。除非有一堆人很愿意大声喊出，“不，你是个傻瓜。”'

  zh: '**James**: 理想情况下，你不会出现在那些技术会议上。'
- en: '**Dan**: Yeah, I mean, so the comments that I’ve gotten on posts that I’ve
    had kind of pop up. So it’s actually worth breaking down a little bit more of
    the what? Like when you submit a link, it goes to the new page and there are not
    that many people who go to the new page and it’s just a continuous stream. Like
    you can actually go to Hacker News. It’s called [news.ycombinator.com](http://news.ycombinator.com).
    I’m sure we’ll put a link in the show notes, but if you go there and you go to
    the new link, you can just see this stream of things. And occasionally once you
    get basically four or five points that are… Again, because of the moderation,
    you can’t really send this link to all your friends and say hey, please upvote
    it. They will detect that kind of voting ring. But if it gets organic upvotes
    to four or five, it moves on to the second page or the first page, and there’s
    a complicated algorithm that changes over time, but that’s where the traffic comes
    from, is the front page. That’s where most people go.'
  id: totrans-split-22

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: '**Dan**: 是的，我的意思是，对我发表的帖子的评论有点值得一提。所以，实际上值得更详细地分析一下是什么？当你提交一个链接时，它会进入新页面，而去新页面的人并不多，它只是一个连续的流。你实际上可以去黑客新闻看看。它叫做[news.ycombinator.com](http://news.ycombinator.com)。我确信我们会在节目笔记中放上一个链接，但如果你去那里并点击新链接，你就可以看到这一系列的东西。偶尔，一旦你基本上得到了四到五个点，由于审查制度，你不能真的把这个链接发送给你所有的朋友，说“嘿，请给它投票”。他们会检测到这种投票环。但是如果它得到了有机的四到五个点的赞同，它就会进入第二页或第一页，而且有一个随时间变化的复杂算法，但流量来自这里，就是首页。那是大多数人去的地方。'
- en: '**James**: I think one thing that we didn’t do, actually, Dan, on the intro,
    necessarily, is you’re kind of Hacker News famous. I mean, you know, you’re Dan
    Moore. But I mean, there is a reason why people should listen to you.'

    know, you’ve talked about the amount of traffic it can drive. Like, you know,

- en: '**Dan**: Yeah, yeah, yeah. That’s a fair point. So I’ve been on Hacker News
    since, like, 2012, and I have a karma of 63,000, which puts me at, like, number
    45 or 46 on the top 100\. I’ve submitted at 12,000 stories, and then I don’t have
    my count of comments, but, yeah, so I spent a fair amount of time on there, and
    I’ve definitely had a number of things go up above, like, 100 points, which pretty
    much means you’re on the hanging out homepage for a number of hours. Some stuff
    is my stuff. And then one of my favorite parts about Hacker News, and one of the
    things I like to do, which you alluded to, Kate, is I like to post other people’s
    things that are interesting. I’ve had you all, and I’ve had other folks that have…
    I’d say it’s taken a ride on the Hacker News train, where you get to be on the
    front page and you get to see the comments, and you get the traffic. And it’s
    a real fun, exhilarating experience. And it’s fun to be able to hand that to other
    people with nothing other than posting a link that I think is worthwhile content.'

  zh: '**Dan**: 是的，是的，是的。这是一个很有道理的观点。所以我从2012年开始上Hacker News，我的积分是63,000，排名大约是前100的第45或46名。我提交了12,000篇故事，然后评论的数量我没有统计，但是，我在那里花费了相当长的时间，肯定有一些事情的评分超过了100分，这几乎意味着你在主页上待了几个小时。有些是我的作品。然后Hacker
    News的我最喜欢的部分之一，也是我喜欢做的事情之一，就是我喜欢发布其他人觉得有趣的东西。我有你们所有人，还有其他一些人，他们也...我会说它是搭乘Hacker
    News列车的一次旅行，在这里你可以登上主页，看到评论，并获得流量。这是一种真正有趣、令人兴奋的体验。而且很有趣的是，我只需发布我认为有价值的链接，就能将这种体验分享给其他人。'

  zh: '**Kate**: 那真是太棒了。所以，当你说花费相当长的时间时，一天要多少个小时？'
- en: '**Dan**: I would say I probably spend less than some people. I’m probably maybe
    30 to 40, 45 minutes a day. Sometimes it’s more, and actually, that’s actually
    worth breaking down. So if you want to interact with Hacker News, there’s two
    main ways to do it. The first is submissions, and that’s obviously easier. And
    then there’s commenting. So commenting, you have to, like, write text. It needs
    to be relatively intelligent. It takes longer. I did a breakdown of the top ten
    folks. And where’s that? I have it written down someplace. I want to say, oh yeah,
    here it is. Three. You basically can look at every — so that’s another actually
    — point is, everyone’s posts are all public, so you can go look at anyone’s profile.
    You can see everything they have commented, all the links they’ve submitted. You
    can’t see things they’ve upvoted or downvoted. Of those top ten posters, three
    of them got most of their points by commenting, and then six of them by submitting,
    and then one was kind of like evenly split, and that was totally anecdotal. I
    looked at the first page of their interactions, so I am more of a submitter.'

  zh: '**Dan**: 我会说，我可能比一些人花的时间少。我可能每天大约30到40、45分钟。有时候会更多，这实际上值得详细分析。所以如果你想和Hacker
    News互动，有两种主要的方式。第一种是提交，显然更容易。然后是评论。评论需要你写文本，需要相对智能，花费的时间更长。我分析了前十位用户。在哪儿呢？我记得我把它写在某个地方。我想说，哦，对了，在这里。三个。你基本上可以查看每一个——所以这实际上——一个点是，每个人的帖子都是公开的，所以你可以查看任何人的个人资料。你可以看到他们评论过的所有东西，他们提交的所有链接。你无法看到他们赞成或反对的东西。在那十位顶级用户中，有三位主要通过评论获得积分，六位通过提交获得积分，还有一位基本上是均分的，这完全是个案例。我看了他们互动的第一页，所以我更像是一个提交者。'
- en: I will find interesting things. I will submit them. I do comment on stuff occasionally,
    but there are people who spend a lot of time commenting. patio11, Patrick McKenzie
    is an example of someone who spends a lot of time commenting, and most of his
    points are from that. So obviously link submitting is much quicker. You need to
    find the links, you need to bash them up. You can only submit four links at a
    time on that new page. You can’t have more than four. It’ll say, please don’t
    submit so much. Which is again, as a kind of a spam prevention measure, but I’ll
    batch them up and then I’ll do like four in the morning, and then like, you know,
    four at noon and maybe four at some other time.

  zh: 我会找到有趣的事情。我会提交它们。我偶尔会评论一些东西，但是有些人花费了大量时间在评论上。像patio11，Patrick McKenzie就是一个花了很多时间在评论上的例子，他大部分积分都来自于此。显然，提交链接要快得多。你需要找到链接，你需要把它们搞定。你在新页面上一次只能提交四个链接。你不能超过四个。它会说，请不要提交那么多。这又是一种防止垃圾邮件的措施，但是我会把它们批量处理，然后早上做四个，然后中午四个，也许在其他时间再做四个。
- en: '**Kate**: One of the things that surprised me about the submissions to Hacker
    News when I was just kind of starting to become involved with the community, is
    how many don’t actually relate to tech. They can. Yeah, I mean, I should have
    kind of come up with a range of what examples here. But, you know, I mean, they
    just, it kind of goes across a range. And what further surprised me is the number
    of people who are experts in these sort of disparate fields. I mean, I anticipated
    that it was going to be a lot of software developers, and of course it is. But
    there’s also people who know a lot about, like, biomedical science and yeah, like
    philosophy, you know, things that you just wouldn’t anticipate. History. I mean,
    there just seems to be an expert in every domain on Hacker News, and so for whatever
    reason, they’re all interested in just the sort of the oeuvre there, like the
    corpus of links which draw the most common. I mean, it was just remarkable to
    me. I didn’t realize there were that many experts in the world.'

  zh: '**Kate**: 当我刚开始加入黑客新闻社区，我发现发布到网站的内容意外地与科技关系不大。它们是可以相关的，我的意思是，我应该提前把这些例子列举出来。实际上，这些内容覆盖了广泛的领域，而且进一步令我惊讶的是，这些在不同领域中具有专家水平的人数量。我认为可能会有很多软件开发者，当然这一点也存在，但也有很多人对生物医学科学等人类意想不到的领域有深入的了解，甚至还涉及哲学、历史等。我在黑客新闻网站上发现几乎每个领域都有专家的身影，因为这里关注的是一系列流行的链接集合，这些链接吸引了大量关注。这对我来说真的很惊人，我没有意识到世界上居然有那么多人具备如此专业的知识。'
- en: '**Dan**: Yeah, my favorite, I think, post that is kind of bizarre is: [I sell
    onions on the Internet](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19728132). And I
    can dig it up, but it was like this person who was just talking about how they
    sold onions, like they were a farmer who sold onions on the Internet, and they
    talked about their story and it was like totally random. But anything that’s about,
    that is of interest to nerds of any stripe is fair sense. That’s kind of my thing.
    If it’s not going to be interesting to someone who’s deeply interested in the
    topic, it’s probably not going to do very well on Hacker News. So I would say
    over the last couple of years, it’s kind of trended more towards some business
    and financy things too. So it’s not just pure tech, but stuff about the housing
    market in the US does pretty well sometimes. So there’s some aspect of the audience
    being interested things that normal people are interested in too. But definitely
    the deeper and harder core your article is, especially if it’s about, I mean,
    it doesn’t need to be about tech, but like if it’s really, really deep about gardening
    and it has data and images and things like that, or it just is a really good,
    interesting story. Both of those do well on Hacker News too.'

  zh: '**Dan**: 对于我而言，我最喜欢的或许略显怪异的一篇文章是：[我在网上卖洋葱](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19728132)。我可以把文章找出来，这是一个只是在谈论他们如何在网上售卖洋葱，就像是一位在网上售卖洋葱的农民那样，他们的故事充满随机性。但任何对任何类型的网络达人来说感兴趣的内容都是合理的。这是我的观点。如果一篇文章对深入探讨该主题的人来说不是那么有趣，很可能在黑客新闻网站上表现不佳。因此，我认为在过去几年里，更偏向于一些商业和金融的内容也逐渐流行起来。所以，这不只是纯粹的科技内容，关于美国房地产市场的文章有时也有不错的表现。这种情况下，读者对普通人感兴趣的事物也有兴趣。但毫无疑问，文章的深度和核心内容往往是关键，特别是关于某个主题的深入讨论，比如园艺（并且包括数据、图片等）或讲述一个充满趣味性的故事。这类文章同样在黑客新闻网站中获得高度关注。'

    is random luck is there too. Sometimes something strikes and then people are interested
    in it. Sometimes if you just need to interest those four or five people that upvoted

    life that’s all its own. You know, my own personal best Hacker News post was a

- en: So, Dan, one of the things I talk about is that the fundamental forces of the
    universe are basically outrage and confirmation bias. Those are the two things
    that dictate human behavior and the physical laws of the universe, outrage and
    confirmation bias. So when we look at social, that’s certainly the case. The algorithm
    tends to favor the outrage. So we certainly see that on YouTube, constant red
    pilling. We see that in the conversations on Twitter. The grifters are always
    driving the outrage narratives. We see it in the broader culture. Is that true
    of Hacker News? Are people looking for things that confirms their bias and outrage,
    or is it somehow an outlier here? And it’s truly nerdery that is not so outrage
    driven.

  zh: 所以，Dan，我谈论的一件事是，宇宙的基本力量基本上是愤怒和确认偏见。这两者决定了人类行为和宇宙的物理定律，愤怒和确认偏见。因此，当我们看社会时，这显然是个问题。算法倾向于支持愤怒情绪。因此，我们在YouTube上经常看到持续的"红丸"现象。我们在Twitter的对话中也看到这一点。骗子们总是在推动愤怒情绪的叙述。我们在更广泛的文化中也看到这种现象。Hacker
    News也是如此吗？人们是否在寻找能够确认他们偏见和愤怒的东西，还是说这里有些特殊的情况？这里确实是真正的极客之地，不那么受愤怒驱动。
- en: '**Dan**: I mean, I’m obviously biased because this is a community that I want
    to spend a lot of time in and I like. I think it’s less driven by outrage and
    confirmation– maybe not so much confirmation bias, but outrage. I think if you
    are an a-hole, if you are doing things that you would not want someone to do in
    a neighborhood or community, within certain… you will get downvoted and you will
    also — I’ve seen moderators chime in and say, hey, that behavior is not acceptable
    here, even to the point of, like, disconnecting comments from the current thread.
    So I think outrage, except for if it’s outrage towards, like, employers return
    to office like that, I think is fair game right now on Hacker News. But general,
    the kind of things that people do on X or Twitter is kind of poo pooed there,
    right? They really want… Your comments, they don’t want you to plus one the comments,
    they want you to really have substantial comments. As far as confirmation bias,
    I think that is much, that’s really on the nose, James. Like, I think that there’s
    a ton of that, and you can get some traffic by presenting things that kind of
    work against people’s confirmation bias.'

    News上现在是公平竞争的。但一般来说，人们在X或Twitter上做的那种事在这里被看作是不太受欢迎的，对吧？他们真的不希望你只是顶一下评论，他们希望你真正发表有实质性的评论。至于确认偏见，我认为这一点非常明显，James。我认为那里确实存在很多这种情况，你可以通过提出一些违反人们确认偏见的事情来获得一些流量。'
- en: People, I think that nerds are… I don’t want to say that they’re not human in
    terms of searching for confirmation bias. I think they are. I think that a lot
    of, maybe more than other communities, nerds get, like, puff themselves up or
    think better themselves if they take an alternative stance. And so that kind of
    can play into the community, too, right? Like, oh, everyone thinks you should
    buy a home. Here’s a methodical reason why you should rent. And if it’s logical

    Why is it like this? And that was useful commentary to us. The other effect that
    I found surprising is there’s an echo effect. So if you get something on front
    page of Hacker News that’s about Ruby, for instance, chances are very high that

- en: '**Kate**: Oh, my God. So, Dan, as we do wrap this up, what are your preferred
    social channels? If folks want to follow you beyond Hacker News, where are you
    doing any speaking in 2024? How can we keep up with your exciting plans for the

  zh: '**Kate**: 哦，天哪。所以，Dan，在我们结束之前，你喜欢使用哪些社交渠道？如果大家想要在Hacker News之外关注你，你在2024年有哪些演讲？我们如何能跟上你在新一年以及你自己的研究中的激动人心的计划？'
- en: '**Dan**: Sure, sure. Yeah. So I’m talking at Devnexus down in Atlanta. I’m
    giving a talk about Passkeys and WebAuthn, and then you can follow me on Twitter
    at [@mooreds](https://twitter.com/mooreds). I’d love to interact with you on Hacker
    News again, [mooreds](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=mooreds) and then LinkedIn,
    [mooreds](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mooreds/). So would love to connect. And
    if you have particular questions about what things do well on Hacker News or what
    you should do to prepare as a company for something going on live on Hacker News,
    I have some resources there, and I can put them in the show — I’ll share them
    with you. So you can add in the show notes, but always happy to talk to somebody
    to help.'
