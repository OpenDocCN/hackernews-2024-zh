    very famous. No, not because of [cold fusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Pons)

    the forerunner to the modern internet. The other three nodes were in California;
    connecting to Utah was a major test of the network’s ability to work across long
    distances.

    (command-and-control even in spite of a nuclear attack) and turned it into research
    into networking and collaboration. The pattern continued: academic exploration
    of computer technologies has produced a bewildering array of experiments, and
    no doubt students at institutions have benefited greatly from being able to play
    with local, experimental computer tools while they study.'

    a Web design class to Communication majors. Simple enough: each and every person
    affiliated with Utah had their own domain (something like domain.utah.edu/~username)
    on a local server, complete with FTP access via their email credentials. I taught
    students the basics of HTML and CSS. I got to see students who were openly scared
    of coding make things that appeared on their screens – and on the internet. It
    was fun!'

    harder and harder to get students into their web space. It turns out that Utah
    was winding down web hosting for everyone, centralizing its web presence and no
    longer providing web space to anyone. To support our class, the IT folks helpfully
    carved out some space on a server, specifically for our Comm Intro to the Web
    Design students, but we knew this was an exception.

    Instead of fully-functional desktops, students were accessing their servers over
    a convoluted “thin client” computer lab setup. I had to spend the first 2 weeks
    just showing them how to find their files – since they were no longer local –
    and then FTP into a server to move those files over a client-to-cloud-to-FTP setup.
    This was for students who had no networking or web design experience – it was
    *rough*. (And if we needed software – such as basic text editor – good luck getting
    it when all the software was on a cloud somewhere).

    vent our frustration by jokingly saying, “Welcome to Node 4!” The irony being
    that Utah was once *25% of the freakin’ Internet* but we could not get easy access
    to basic Web hosting. It was an ordeal just to get students to the point where
    they could move a text file they were working on to a server.

    But just the other day, my colleagues met for a faculty meeting, and we discussed
    recruiting students. Someone suggested we post information about our faculty to
    our department website and social media. “No,” the chair said. “All of that would
    have to go through the central administration” – the implication being either
    it wouldn’t be allowed, or that it would take months to achieve.

    Lost the Internet.” How did we get from many nodes to everything being dumped

    we get to the point where university core functions were run by for-profit firms?

    Goal 1 of my blog is to [document the life of the “FOSS Academic”](/2020/11/27/introduction.html)
    – my attempt to do most or all of my professorial work using FOSS tools and self-hosting.
    I use Nextcloud for document sharing, collaboration, and conferencing, Zotero
    for managing bibliographies, Thunderbird for managing emails and calendars, Libreoffice
    for writing. I use Syncthing, Wireguard, and Nextcloud on a local network to move
    data from home to office. Of course, all of this is running on Linux machines
    (Manjaro KDE, if you’re curious).

    however).

    Sharepoint, Office. The assumption among my colleagues is that I use all of these
    regularly. I get why they think that – it’s what’s provided. But I’m starting
    to get pressure to put my calendar on Outlook, since people assume that if my
    Outlook calendar is open, I can meet. Whenever my colleagues want to work on documents,
    it’s in Office online, not a draft passed back and forth. And all of my department’s
    governance runs through Teams (a program so awfully designed it wastes time –
    I can hardly find anything in it).
