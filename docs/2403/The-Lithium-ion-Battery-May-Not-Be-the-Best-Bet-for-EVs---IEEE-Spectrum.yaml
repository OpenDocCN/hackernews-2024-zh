    hit the roads, the environmental impact of their battery production will also
    increase. This raises a major question: What type of EV battery will be the most
    environmentally friendly on a large scale?'

- en: A [study](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10418456) published 1 February
    in [*IEEE Access*](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/RecentIssue.jsp?punumber=6287639)
    suggests that, after considering five different types of EV battery cells, lithium-sulfur
    cells will be the most environmentally friendly. The results also suggest that
    cells that don’t rely on precious and critical metals are fundamental for ensuring
    sustainable production.

    are being developed and tested, and they are slated to hit the market in the next
    few years. Each one involves different pros and cons when it comes to energy density
    and the environmental impacts of its production and use.

    (SiCPAN) and silicon nanowire (SiNW) cells—have much greater energy density than
    traditional lithium-ion cells, which are made with graphite anodes. However, these
    silicon-based cells currently require the incorporation of precious metals, such
    as silver, to help stabilize them during charging and discharging.

- en: Another option is the use of all-solid-state cells, which offer nearly double
    the energy density of the best-performing lithium-ion batteries, resulting in
    a smaller and lighter battery pack. However, this technology also requires the
    incorporation of precious metals.

- en: Lastly, lithium-sulfur cells are emerging as a promising battery for [EVs](https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/evs)
    because, theoretically, they have high capacity and energy density—without containing
    rare earth metals. Despite that advantage, more technology advancements are needed
    to realize the full potential of these cells.

    all-solid-state, and lithium-sulfur cells, compared with the conventional lithium-ion
    cell. “We selected [these] cells as current representatives of the most promising
    technologies for the automotive market in the next decades,” explains Accardo.

    prospective life-cycle assessment, which looks at the full impact of each cell
    over the course of its production from sourcing the raw materials to the point

    the cells in terms of their impact on six criteria: [climate change](https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/climate-change),
    or total greenhouse gas emissions during production; acidification, or emissions
    of sulfuric and nitrogen oxides that acidify water and soil; eutrophication of
    fresh water, or potentially harmful accumulation of algae and sediments in freshwater
    systems; ecotoxicity of fresh water, or the release of toxic substances into freshwater
    systems; the use of fossil fuels in production; and the depletion of mineral and

    and SiNW cells had two and three times as much carbon dioxide emissions, respectively,

    change but also in many other categories assessed in the study, including acidification,
    the use of fossil fuel resources, and eutrophication of fresh water. This is predominantly
    because SiNWs involve the use of substantial amounts of precious metals (such
    as the silver nitrate used as a catalyst) and energy-intensive nanoscale manufacturing
    processes, which also release toxic by-products.**'

    the impact of SiNW, SiCPAN, and all-solid-state cells if they could theoretically

    without silver would be the least impactful cell among all of the next-generation
