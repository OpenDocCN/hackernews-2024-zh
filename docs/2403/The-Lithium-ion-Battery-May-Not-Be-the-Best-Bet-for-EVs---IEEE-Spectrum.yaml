    hit the roads, the environmental impact of their battery production will also
    increase. This raises a major question: What type of EV battery will be the most
    environmentally friendly on a large scale?'

    in [*IEEE Access*](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/RecentIssue.jsp?punumber=6287639)
    suggests that, after considering five different types of EV battery cells, lithium-sulfur
    cells will be the most environmentally friendly. The results also suggest that
    cells that don’t rely on precious and critical metals are fundamental for ensuring
    sustainable production.

    are being developed and tested, and they are slated to hit the market in the next
    few years. Each one involves different pros and cons when it comes to energy density
    and the environmental impacts of its production and use.

    (SiCPAN) and silicon nanowire (SiNW) cells—have much greater energy density than
    traditional lithium-ion cells, which are made with graphite anodes. However, these
    silicon-based cells currently require the incorporation of precious metals, such
    as silver, to help stabilize them during charging and discharging.

    the energy density of the best-performing lithium-ion batteries, resulting in
    a smaller and lighter battery pack. However, this technology also requires the
    incorporation of precious metals.

    because, theoretically, they have high capacity and energy density—without containing
    rare earth metals. Despite that advantage, more technology advancements are needed
    to realize the full potential of these cells.

    of sulfuric and nitrogen oxides that acidify water and soil; eutrophication of
