    building system. With light-framed wood construction, the risk of fire limits
    how tall you can safely build; typically 5 stories in the US (hence the [“5 over
    1”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5-over-1) construction type so popular in multifamily
    construction). And some argue that even these limits are too high, based on the
    fact that the US has a [much higher rate of fire death](https://www.construction-physics.com/p/wood-construction-and-the-risk-of)

    ones during a fire. Specifically, with mass timber a layer of charred wood forms
    around the outside that protects the wood on the inside from further combustion.
    Size your structural elements correctly, and a mass timber building will survive
    a fire much longer than a light-framed wood building. This gives more time for
    people to evacuate to safety, which makes it possible to safely build much taller
    buildings out of wood. While light-framed wood is typically limited to 5 stories
    in the US, mass timber buildings have been [built up to 19 stories](https://www.thorntontomasetti.com/project/ascent).

    It sequesters a huge amount of carbon because of the volume of wood it uses, so
    it's far less carbon-intensive than concrete or steel. It’s often possible to
    leave mass timber elements exposed in the finished building, which creates an
    attractive finish for walls or ceilings that some tenants are willing to pay extra
    for. Because it’s prefabricated, the structure of a mass timber building is built
    very fast, and the construction is much quieter than other building methods.

    a building’s floor. Per [Smartlam’s span tables](https://www.smartlam.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/SmartLam-2020-Cross-Laminated-Timber-Specification-Guide_June_compressed.pdf)

    is that it adds extra processing steps. To produce construction lumber, trees
    are cut down and brought to a sawmill, where they’re cut into dimensional lumber
    (2x4s, 2x6s, etc) or processed into other timber products such as plywood or OSB.
    Much light-framed wood construction, such as walls and roof rafters, uses dimensional
    lumber that comes directly from the sawmill. In other cases, such as with floor
    trusses, the lumber must go through another processing step between the mill and
    the construction site, but the equipment for this processing is relatively simple
    and inexpensive. [Here](https://www.woodtechsystems.com/product/2003-alpine-floormaster-floor-truss-machine/),

    support of mass timber might mean for US housing construction. Like the US, Canada
    has enormous supplies of wood, and builds much of its housing using light-framed
    wood construction. Canada, especially the province of British Columbia (BC) has
    led the charge for the use of mass timber in North America. The Canadian forest
    product non-profit FPInnovations published a widely-used [CLT design handbook](https://web.fpinnovations.ca/download/clt-handbook-2019-full-edition/)
    in 2011, and in 2018 Canada built what at the time was the world’s tallest mass-timber
    building, the [18-story Brock Commons](https://www.thinkwood.com/construction-projects/brock-commons-tallwood-house).
    Canada’s national and provincial building codes have steadily increased the height
    allowance for timber buildings (though they often fall short of what the current
    version of the IBC allows), and many provinces have passed legislation requiring
    wood be the first material considered for publicly funded projects. Many prominent
    mass timber manufacturers and designers, such as [Seagate](https://seagatemasstimber.com/),
    [Nordic](https://www.nordic.ca/en), [Equilibrium](https://eqcanada.com/), [Michael
    Green Architecture](https://mg-architecture.ca/), and [Structurecraft](https://structurecraft.com/)
    are located in Canada. As of 2022, the province of BC alone [had constructed](https://www.thinkwood.com/construction-projects/brock-commons-tallwood-house)
    nearly as many mass timber buildings as the entire US.

    prevent mass timber buildings from being built now, though it certainly makes
    it easier. Older codes have provisions that allow for shorter mass timber buildings
    (called Type IV construction), and they can also be built using the code provisions
    that current light-framed wood structures use (Type III or Type V construction).
    The updated codes are specifically required only for tall mass timber buildings,
    or where the mass timber will be left exposed in the final condition.

    without updating the code. Because the most recent version of the IBC has allowances
    for tall mass timber buildings, building officials are often willing to accept
    them even if their state code doesn’t technically allow them. Several tall mass
    timber buildings in the US, such as Ascent in Milwaukee, have been built without

    wood buildings without very careful consideration, despite what the code says.
    And what they say goes. Adopting the most recent IBC would reduce the permitting
    barriers to mass timber adoption, and I’m in favor of it, but it’s not like flipping
