- en: Constant-time programming is a paradigm that aims to harden code against side-channel
    attacks by ensuring that all operations take the same amount of time, regardless
    of their operands. In particular, constant-time code cannot contain secret-dependent
    branches, loops, or other control structures. Moreover, as the CPU caches different
    addresses with attacker-observable latency, constant-time code cannot mix data
    and addresses in any way and prohibits the use of secret-dependent memory accesses
    or array indices.

- en: We show that even if a victim correctly separates data from addresses by following
    the constant-time paradigm, the DMP will generate secret-dependent memory access
    on the victim's behalf, resulting in variable-time code susceptible to our key-extraction
    attacks.
