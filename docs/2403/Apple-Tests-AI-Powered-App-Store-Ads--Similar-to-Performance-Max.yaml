- en: Apple is taking a cue from Google and Meta by experimenting with a new AI-powered
    way to buy its App Store ads, according to two people familiar with the matter.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Apple has begun testing a product with a small group of advertisers that automatically
    decides where to place ads within its App Store, much like Google's Performance
    Max and Meta's Advantage+.

- en: Apple's current ad formats consist of two types of ads within the search tab
    and on the search-results page, "you might also like" ads that appear on app product
    pages, and those that appear on the "today" tab when users open the App Store.
    In this new campaign type, advertisers enter their budget and cost-per-acquisition
    target, as well as the audiences and countries they want to reach. Apple's algorithm
    then automatically decides where best to place the brand's ads across the four
    available formats.

- en: Apple has told advertisers it's conducting the tests in an effort to learn how
    it can improve the performance of its Apple Search Ads, but one of the people
    familiar with the matter said they expected the company to officially introduce
    the product in the coming months. This person was granted anonymity because they
    were not authorized to speak publicly about the program.

    regularly reference those products on their earnings calls as key growth drivers.
    Google says Performance Max drives better results, though [some advertisers are
    skeptical](https://www.businessinsider.com/google-ai-boosts-ad-performance-but-some-advertisers-push-back-2023-11)
    of the product because the company doesn't provide detailed breakdowns about where
    their ads ran. Meta does disclose Advantage+ placement reports.

    mobile-advertising experts said it could logically follow that Apple would eventually
    expand it to other properties.

    types of deliver value," Eric Seufert, an analyst, an investor, and the founder
    of Mobile Dev Memo, said.'

- en: Seufert added that while he was skeptical Apple would place mobile app-install
    ads in its News and Stock apps — because they're managed using a different ads
    interface — a Performance Max-type tool could be a precursor to Apple launching
    new ad placements in its other assets. Commentators have previously speculated
    that [Apple would soon bring ads to Maps, Apple TV+, and its Books app](https://www.businessinsider.com/6-predictions-for-apple-advertising-platform-next-year-2022-12).
    [Apple also recently launched a Sports app](https://www.businessinsider.com/apple-sports-app-is-here-2024-2),
    which could be another contender for new ad spots.

- en: Apple's ad business is on track to generate $7 billion in revenue this year,
    up $1 billion from 2023, according to analysts at the research firm Omdia. Most
    of that revenue is derived from its App Store search ads, though it has recently
    made progress in other areas.

    which suggests it may have bigger advertising ambitions, such as following rivals
    including Netflix by adding an advertising tier to Apple TV+.
