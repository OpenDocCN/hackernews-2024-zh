    implausible, unworkable, and, moreover, inefficient.

- en: The Trash Compactor Debate turns on whether the Death Star ejects its trash
    into space. I, for one, believe it does. Though we never see the Death Star ejecting
    its trash, we do see another Empire ship, the so-called Star Destroyer, ejecting
    its trash into space. I, therefore, see no reason to suspect that Empire protocol
    dictating that trash be ejected into space would not apply equally to all Empire
    spacecraft, including the Death Star.

- en: The Death Star clearly has a garbage-disposal problem. Given its size and massive
    personnel, the amount of waste it generates — discarded food, broken equipment,
    excrement, and the like — boggles the imagination. That said, I just cannot fathom
    how an organization as ruthless and efficiently run as the Empire would have signed
    off on such a dangerous, unsanitary, and shoddy garbage-disposal system as the
    one depicted in the movie.

- en: 1\. Ignoring the question of how Princess Leia could possibly know where the
    trash compactor is or that the vent she blasts open leads to a good hiding place
    for the rescue crew, why are there vents leading down there at all? Would not
    vents leading into any garbage-disposal system allow the fetid smell of rotting
    garbage, spores, molds, etc., to seep up into the rest of the Death Star? Would
    not it have been more prudent for the designers of the Death Star to opt for a
    closed system, like a septic tank?

- en: 2\. Why do both walls of the trash compactor move towards each other, rather
    than employing a one-movable-wall system that would thus rely on the anchored
    stability, to say nothing of the strength of the other non-moving wall, to crush
    trash more effectively?

- en: 3\. Why does the trash compactor compact trash so slowly and with such difficulty
    once the resistance of a thin metal rod is introduced? Surely metal Death Star
    pieces are one of the main items of trash in need of compacting. It thus stands
    to reason that the trash compactor should have been better designed to handle
    the problem of a skinny piece of metal. (And while I hate to be the sort of person
    who says I told you so, I’d be remiss if I didn’t point out that a one-movable-wall
    system would have improved performance.)

    space, wouldn’t the flattened, living-room-sized, and extremely solid panes of
    trash that result from such a primitive, unidirectional trash compactor pose serious
    hazards for Empire starships in the vicinity?

- en: 5\. And what of the creature that lives in the trash compactor? Presumably,
    the creature survives because the moving walls do not extend all the way to the
    floor of the room, where the liquid is. After all, if the walls reached the floor,
    the creature would be killed each time trash is compacted. The design employed
    on the Death Star must allow the organic trash to filter down to the bottom, where
    the parasitic worm-creature devours it. But what happens when heavier pieces of
    non-organic trash fall down there? Would such trash not get wedged under the doors,
    causing them to malfunction? Do stormtroopers have to confront the creature each
    time they retrieve pieces of un-compacted trash?

  zh: 5\. 那些生活在垃圾压缩机中的生物怎么样？据推测，这些生物之所以存活，是因为移动的墙壁没有延伸到房间的地板处，那里是液体。毕竟，如果墙壁延伸到地板，每次压缩垃圾时这些生物都会被杀死。死星上采用的设计必须允许有机垃圾过滤到底部，寄生虫寄生生物在那里吞食它。但当更重的无机垃圾坠落到那里时会发生什么？这种垃圾不会卡在门下导致其故障吗？冲锋队士兵每次取出未压缩的垃圾时，都必须面对这些生物吗？

    Are we to believe that the architects of the Death Star, a group of individuals
    bent on controlling the entire known universe, are also concerned about environmental
    issues? Would organic garbage rot in space? So what? Furthermore, why has the
    Empire gone to the trouble of acquiring a frightening parasitic worm-creature
    and having it eat all organic trash, especially given the aforementioned flaws
    in the design of the compactor and overall maintenance hassles?

- en: 9\. If the Empire insists on ejecting trash into space, why do they bother compacting
    it? Space is infinite, is it not? In such an environment, it hardly matters what
    size the trash is. In fact, a persuasive argument can be made that it’s actually
    better for the trash to take up more space so that it appears on radar systems
    as something for Empire ships to avoid. Compacted trash creates smaller chunks
    of harder trash that would undoubtedly cause serious damage to Empire starships.
    And needless to say, damage to starships would, in turn, create yet more hassles
    and headaches for the Empire.

  zh: 9\. 如果帝国坚持将垃圾射入太空，为什么他们还要压缩它？太空是无限的，不是吗？在这样的环境中，垃圾的大小几乎无关紧要。事实上，可以提出令人信服的论点，即让垃圾占用更多空间，这样它在雷达系统中就会显示为帝国舰艇需要避开的东西。压缩的垃圾会产生更小、更硬的垃圾块，无疑会对帝国星舰造成严重损坏。不用说，对星舰的损坏将进一步为帝国制造更多麻烦和头痛。
