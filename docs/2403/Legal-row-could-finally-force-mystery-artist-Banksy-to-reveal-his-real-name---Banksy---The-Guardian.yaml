    vandal” ridiculing authority figures through artworks in public places. His partially
    shredded painting *Love is in the Bin* sold for [more than £18.5m](https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2021/oct/14/banksy-auction-record-shredded-painting-love-is-in-the-bin)
    at auction in 2021, while his signed prints sell for five and six figures. Pest
    Control was set up by the artist in 2008 after fake prints were sold online and
    it plays a key role in the market for his work. An authentication certificate
    is vital to achieve the maximum price when selling his work, it has been claimed.

    a then 34-year old former public schoolboy, although the artist denied this. No
    one has been able to absolutely link Gunningham and Banksy. To do so would destroy

    to tell me whether or not it’s a work of art by Leonardo da Vinci. In the case
