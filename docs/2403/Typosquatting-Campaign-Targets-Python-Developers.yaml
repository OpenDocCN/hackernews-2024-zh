- en: 'On 26 March 2024, Phylum’s automated risk detection platform picked up yet
    another typosquat campaign targeting some attackers’ favorite targets in PyPI.
    As of writing, this attack still appears to be active and has come in two big
    waves after about a 20-hour break in between. So far, we’ve seen over 500 typosquat
    variations published targeting the following popular Python libraries:'

  zh: 在2024年3月26日，Phylum的自动化风险检测平台再次发现针对PyPI中一些攻击者喜欢的目标的一次typosquat活动。截至目前，这次攻击似乎仍然活跃，并在中间间隔约20小时后分两次大波发生。到目前为止，我们已经看到超过500个typosquat变体发布，针对以下热门Python库：
- en: 'First, a few hours before the automated attack started we can see the attacker
    experimenting with a package called `schubismomv3`. 11 packages and about 2.5
    hours later, we can see the attacker testing a variety of malware deployment techniques.
    In the first 4 releases we can see the attacker experimenting with install hooks:'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 首先，在自动化攻击开始几个小时前，我们可以看到攻击者正在尝试使用一个名为`schubismomv3`的软件包。大约2.5小时后，我们可以看到攻击者在测试各种恶意软件部署技术。在前4个版本发布中，我们可以看到攻击者在尝试安装钩子：
- en: 'Then we can see them experimenting with smuggling the encrypted payload in
    a string that gets written to a local file and then executed:'
  id: totrans-split-8

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 然后我们可以看到他们试图通过将加密的负载嵌入字符串来进行走私，然后将其写入本地文件并执行：
- en: 'The main difference here is that the payload is significantly smaller. Let’s
    quickly decrypt it to see what changed there:'
  id: totrans-split-9
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 这里的主要区别在于负载显著减小。让我们快速解密看看有何变化：
- en: They’ve elected to pull the payload from a remote URL instead of stuffing it
    in its entirety into the setup file. At this point the attacker publishes seven
    more varieties of these packages under different variations of the “insanepackage”
    naming scheme over the next 25 minutes.

- en: 'Finally, at around 15:06 UTC, about 45 minutes after the last “insane” publication,
    we see the start of the typosquatting attack. Over the next 1.5 hours the attacker
    publishes the following typosquat variations:'

  zh: 最后，在UTC时间15:06左右，大约在最后一个“insane”发布后45分钟，我们看到typosquat攻击的开始。在接下来的1.5小时内，攻击者发布了以下typosquat变体：
- en: 'At this point the attack paused with the final publication at 16:31 UTC. Then,
    strangely, the next day at 07:56, the attacker published a package called `johnhammondfanpackage124`
    and another one called `johnhammondontop183` five hours later. After the bizarre
    interlude, the attack picked up again 20 minutes later with the following typosquat
    variations:'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 在这一点上，攻击暂停，并于UTC时间16:31进行最后一次发布。然后，奇怪的是，第二天07:56，攻击者发布了一个名为`johnhammondfanpackage124`的软件包，五小时后发布了另一个名为`johnhammondontop183`的软件包。在这个奇怪的插曲之后，攻击在20分钟后再次开始，发布了以下typosquat变体：
- en: This works out to a total of 566 typosquat publications as of writing. PyPI
    has done a great job of promptly removing these packages. In fact, because this
    attacker had automated the account and project creation process, at 02:16 UTC
    on 28 March 2024, PyPI rightfully decided to put their foot down to prevent further
    publications and fallout from this attack by temporarily suspending new project
    and new account creations.

- en: And there’s our final payload. As mentioned earlier, nothing too novel about
    this. It appears to be a pretty standard stealer, attempting to grab cookies,
    passwords, wallets, etc. At the very end it attempts to grab another payload from
    the `funcaptcha[.]ru` URL; something called `hvnc.py` which, curiously, it then
    writes to disk as a binary file.

- en: This automated typosquat attack carried out over a few short hours in a handful
    of quick bursts, witnessed the publication of over 500 packages and targeted 16
    popular PyPI packages. While PyPI’s quick and heavy-handed response no doubt helped
    mitigate the fallout from this attack, it’s nonetheless worth pointing out that
    not all ecosystems are as quick and effective at dealing with such an attack.
    And for a package whose malware is triggered on install, all it takes is a single
    misplaced finger on the keyboard for your machine to be compromised.

  zh: 这种自动打字错误攻击在短短几个小时内进行了几次快速突发，目击了超过500个包的发布，并针对了16个流行的PyPI包。虽然PyPI迅速而果断的应对无疑有助于减少这次攻击带来的后果，但同样值得注意的是，并非所有的生态系统都能如此迅速和有效地处理这样的攻击。对于一个在安装时触发恶意软件的包来说，只需一个手指放错位置，就可能导致您的计算机被
    compromise。
