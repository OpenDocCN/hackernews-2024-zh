    through the centre of  the city of Utrecht. Unfortunatly, the boat lock is closed
    during spring. You can help the fish.

    of carp, perch, eel and pike. The pike has finally started their migration. We
    saw mainly males so far, but also a beautiful shot of a male and female swimming
    next to each other. You can watch those back on the Fish doorbell News Report.

    still relatively cold. I don’t expect great numbers of fish this week, but since
    the migration for many species has started I think there will be plenty to see.
