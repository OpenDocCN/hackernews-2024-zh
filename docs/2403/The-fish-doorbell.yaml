- en: Every spring fish migrate upstream, in search of places to spawn. They swim
    through the centre of  the city of Utrecht. Unfortunatly, the boat lock is closed
    during spring. You can help the fish.

- en: It looks like the water clears up a bit. Last week we saw some nice sightings
    of carp, perch, eel and pike. The pike has finally started their migration. We
    saw mainly males so far, but also a beautiful shot of a male and female swimming
    next to each other. You can watch those back on the Fish doorbell News Report.

- en: This week temperatures remain stable at around 11 degrees. That means it is
    still relatively cold. I don’t expect great numbers of fish this week, but since
    the migration for many species has started I think there will be plenty to see.
