- en: Fedora Workstation has long defaulted to using GNOME's Wayland session by default,
    but it has continued to install the GNOME X.Org session for fallback purposes
    or those opting to use it instead. But for the Fedora Workstation 41 release later
    in the year, there is a newly-approved plan to no longer have that GNOME X.Org
    session installed by default.

- en: Recently there was a Fedora Workstation ticket opened to no longer install the
    GNOME X.Org session by default. This is just about whether the X.Org session is
    pre-installed but would continue to live in the repository for those wanting to
    explicitly install it.

    will not be installing the GNOME X.Org session by default. Long live Wayland.
