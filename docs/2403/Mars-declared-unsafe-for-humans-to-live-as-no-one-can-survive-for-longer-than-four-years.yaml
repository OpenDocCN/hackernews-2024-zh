    Skolkovo Institute of Science and Technology, and GFZ Potsdam to look into the
    potential impacts of life on Mars.

    radiation and whether it would pose too grave a threat to human life, and the
    second about whether the timing of a mission to Mars could protect astronauts
    and the spacecraft from radiation.'

    used geophysical models of particle radiation for a solar cycle and models of

    Journal, the researchers found that it would not possible for humans to stay on

    from the Sun, distant stars, and galaxies, would exceed safe levels after four
    years on the planet.

    provide enough protection trip to and from the planet - but if the material used
    to build the spacecraft is too thick, then it could actually increase the amount
    of secondary radiation.

    activity is at its peak and the most dangerous particles are deflected, thus shielding
