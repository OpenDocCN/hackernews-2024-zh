    for "leadership" roles are those that don't *want* leadership roles. I think that
    protects from the worst excesses of getting a narcissist in charge, but doesn't
    actually consistently produce *great* leadership. I asked Stephen about this,
    and he happily said that he loves leadership roles (and I can confirm that I never
    felt like a subordinate working with him). Simultaneously, one of the most senior
    people in my current reporting chain is a great person that was forced to take
    up leadership despite promises that they wouldn't have to. Haven't seen them in
    months. Great person, lots of respect for them, sadly absolutely useless to me.
