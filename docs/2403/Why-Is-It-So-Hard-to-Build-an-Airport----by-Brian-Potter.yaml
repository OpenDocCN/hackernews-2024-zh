    in the US but around the world. Airport construction is nearly always vigorously
    opposed by various interest groups, often successfully. As air travel greatly
    expanded in the 1960s and 70s, there were “no more virulent domestic conflicts…
    in the advanced industrial world than those over airport construction.” In her
    history of US airports in the second half of the 20th century, Janet Bednarek
    notes that building a new airport was so “extraordinarily difficult…that very
    few completely new major commercial airports were constructed." Of the 50 largest
    airports in the US, the average age is 82 years, and only three have been built
    in the last 50 years. The US has built more commercial nuclear reactors in the
    past 25 years (two) than it has major commercial airports (none), even though
    air travel increased by [almost 50% over that period.](https://crp.trb.org/acrpwebresource12/understanding-air-service-and-regional-economic-activity/how-has-air-service-changed-over-time/)

    expanding civil aviation infrastructure. Not only did airports need to be enlarged
    to handle the rise in passengers and aircraft moving through them, but jet airliners
    required much longer runways to take off and land than propeller planes did. Lockheed’s
    [Constellation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockheed_Constellation), a 4-engine
    propeller airliner which entered service in 1943, needed a 6000 foot-long runway,
    but the Boeing 707 needed more than 10,000 feet at full takeoff weight, as did
    the Boeing 747 which followed 10 years later. In 1957 an American Airlines executive
    stated that not a single airport the company flew to could fully accommodate the
    new jets, either because of insufficient runway length or insufficient terminal
    facilities. Many believed that the new jet airliners would require their own special
    “jetports” built specifically to accommodate them.

    But noise from jet aircraft proved to be a much more severe problem. The Air Force
    jets under development in the 1950s were expected to be “the loudest man-made
    industrial noise up to now.” And while tests of commercial jet aircraft showed
    that they weren’t necessarily noisier than comparable prop airplanes (tests comparing
    the 707 to the Lockheed Constellation measured similar noise levels), the high-pitched
    frequencies of jet engine noise were discovered to be far more disturbing to human
    ears than piston engines were. And because of the longer takeoff and landing distances,
    a jet airliner would expose many more people to noise than a piston engined aircraft.'

    air transportation brought, in the hopes that understanding would breed acceptance.

    noise problem. The first generation of jet airliners used turbojet engines, in
    which air enters the engine, gets compressed, burned, and is exhausted out at
    supersonic speed. It was this supersonic exhaust which created the lion’s share
    of jet engine noise. But in the late 1950s, a new type of jet engine was developed,
    the turbofan. Unlike the turbojet (where all the air enters the combustion chamber
    and is burned) a turbofan has a large fan mounted to the front that pulls air
    into the engine but around the combustion chamber (because this air bypasses the
    combustion chamber, turbofans are also called bypass engines). The turbofan extracted
    much more energy from the hot exhaust of the combustion chamber, leading to a
    colder exhaust stream. Not only was this more fuel efficient (jet engines are
    most efficient when the speed of their exhaust matches the cruising speed of the
    aircraft), but they were much quieter than turbojets. By 1961, turbofans had replaced
    turbojets on all new commercial jets.

    that could be used to quiet jet engines, such as redesigned engine nacelles and
    fan blades. As a result of this technology and research, and of slowly increasing
    stringency of FAA noise regulations after 1968, the noise of jet engines steadily

    used by US airlines rose by a factor of five. And the more passengers on a jet,

    jet noise showed no signs of abating. In the two years after jets were introduced
    at National Airport (now Ronald Reagan) in Washington DC, the FAA received more
    than 6000 letters from angry citizens. By 1968, LAX was facing three billion dollars
    in lawsuits over jet noise. By 1972, noise in the US (much of it jet related)
    generated more complaints than “any other pollutant or threat to the environment,”
    and experts worried that “violent civil disobedience at airports [was] a real
    possibility in the near future.” In the mid-1970s, millions of people were exposed
    to average aircraft noise levels exceeding 65 decibels (the level at which noise
    is the “most important adverse aspect of the environment”), and airports around
    the country were facing [hundreds of millions of dollars in lawsuits](https://books.google.com/books?id=yEawSy0hDn8C&printsec=frontcover&dq=number+of+lawsuits+against+airport+noise&hl=en&newbks=1&newbks_redir=0&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjDmMOQzMSEAxUe4skDHV1BCJIQ6AF6BAgMEAI#v=onepage&q=lawsuit&f=false).

    likewise only partially address the issue. Airports could route planes over less
    inhabited areas, but there was often limited ability to do this. At JFK, for instance,
    the Port Authority tried to limit takeoffs to runways which faced over the water,
    but this wasn’t possible if traffic was high enough or winds weren’t favorable.
    Airports could also mandate takeoff and landing procedures that minimized noise
    impact, such as “low altitude, reduced power climbs, [and] higher angles of descent,"
    but pilots resisted many of these, claiming they were unsafe. Reduced noise procedures
    were thought to be responsible for at least one crash at JFK.

    municipalities could address problems of aircraft noise. Courts had established
    that exposing a property to aircraft noise constituted a “taking” that required
    compensation (dating from a 1946 case in which low-flying military jets caused
    a farmer's chickens to kill themselves as they ran into the walls in fright).
    And they had also established that airport owners were responsible for the noise
    that they generated. But even as the courts assigned responsibility for noise
    to airports, they greatly restricted what airports could do about it. Airport
    rules that limited night takeoffs and landings, for instance, were often overturned,
    with courts ruling that air traffic fell under the jurisdiction of the FAA. Zoning
    rules near airports that might limit noise exposure were also often struck down
    as not beneficial to the general public. And though airports lobbied for a federal
    noise abatement policy (in part to reduce their own liability), the government
    resisted, and the FAA carefully structured its aircraft noise rules to avoid taking
    any responsibility for implementing noise restrictions.

    airports, such as Chicago’s Midway, Boston Logan, and New York’s LaGuardia were
    built close (or even within) the cities they served (before jets made such construction
    infeasible), many others were built far from the city, only to have the city eventually
    expand around it. O’Hare (which began as an aircraft factory for Douglas Aircraft
    in WWII) was originally built on farmland relatively far from Chicago, but post-war
    sprawl pushed development outward, and by the late 1960s O’Hare had some of the
    most severe noise problems in the country. Denver International Airport was likewise
    deliberately built far from Denver on an enormous empty plot of land in a partially

    a 79,000 acre buffer zone to prevent any issues of incompatible land use. Mirabel

    them near cities difficult. Though early airfields were often small (when Chicago
    Midway opened, it took up just 80 acres, and by the 1950s it was the busiest airport
    in the world on 650 acres of space), a modern airport needs thousands of acres.
    Runways are two miles or more in length, and require thousands of feet of space
    between them to allow simultaneous landing of planes. This, along with the additional
    land needed to be acquired as a noise buffer, means that airports are “the largest
    land using facilities on the urban periphery,” often the size of a city in their
    own right. In the early 1980s, Dallas Fort-Worth Airport covered as much land
    as the city of Dallas did, and Denver International Airport is [as large](https://www.reddit.com/r/aviation/comments/7xkefe/the_actual_size_of_denver_international_airport/)
    as the city of San Francisco. In addition to the difficulty of finding this much
    space, an airport perversely both creates demand for more housing (for the workers,
    along with whatever increase in commerce the airport causes) while removing thousands
    of acres of space for it.

    local residents. But residents aren’t the only ones opposing airport construction.
    They’re also fought by environmentalists. In addition to the noise they generate,
    the size of airports means building one will encroach on what might be ecologically
    valuable areas such as forests or wetlands, damaging them even if they’re just
    used for a noise buffer (the risk of bird strikes means that the ideal airport
    is one surrounded by “sterilized fields” where birds aren’t inclined to nest).
    The huge amount of jet fuel that flows through an airport creates the risk of
    leaks and spills. Decades of fuel spills at JFK resulted in a “vast lake of jet
    fuel” beneath the airport, anywhere from 5 million to 9 million gallons in size.

    and added parallel runways to allow for simultaneous landing of aircraft, increasing
    the volume of aircraft the airport can handle. Airports have also been able to

    aircraft capacity seems to still be rising: between 2000 and 2016, average seat
    capacity on flights around the world increased by 31%. Airlines have also gotten
    better at filling their aircraft to capacity. In 1970, commercial aircraft were
    on average just 49% full. Today, that has [risen to more than 80%](https://www.statista.com/statistics/658830/passenger-load-factor-of-commercial-airlines-worldwide/#:~:text=Global%20airlines''%20combined%20passenger%20load,to%2081%20percent%20in%202023.).
    These all increase the number of passengers transported per airplane, and thus
    allows more passenger volume from the same number of runways.'

    airports that have more capacity. Inability to add capacity has caused Boston
    Logan to begin redirecting traffic to other, regional airports. This sort of shift
    is often facilitated by the hub-and-spoke network of US air travel: since the
    hub isn’t the final destination, it''s often possible for airlines to shift routes
    to go through different hubs if one becomes congested. As O’Hare became congested,
    for instance, some airlines shifted routes to other hubs at St. Louis and Denver.'

    planes are routed. Significant congestion issues at European airports in the late
    1980s were resolved by [improvements](https://www.cabidigitallibrary.org/doi/full/10.5555/19951810318)
    to the air traffic control system. In the US, the [NextGen air traffic control
    program](https://reason.org/policy-study/increasing-airport-capacity-wi/) was
    created to expand air transportation capacity, which does things like researching
    [wake turbulence](https://www.volpe.dot.gov/news/new-aircraft-separation-standards-gain-wider-adoption-saving-time-and-money)
    to see if required aircraft separation distances can be safely reduced. Similarly,
    airport congestion often only occurs at limited peak hours, and capacity can be
    increased by shifting flights to non-peak hours (though airline resistance might
    make this difficult).

    other aspects](https://www.construction-physics.com/p/a-cycle-of-misery-the-business-of)
    of the air transportation system, they’re very profitable. Airports have “extremely
    high credit ratings” (Fitch lists [several major airports](https://www.fitchratings.com/research/us-public-finance/fitch-takes-rating-actions-on-us-large-airports-major-hubs-amid-progression-in-travel-recovery-03-08-2021)
    as having various levels of “A” credit), and can easily finance their expansion
    via issuing bonds. So financing airport infrastructure is a comparatively smaller
    problem than it is for things like mass transit.

    its capacity limits, especially in places like New York which have high traffic
    and limited ability to expand. Severe flight delays occurred across the country
    [in the late 60s, the late 1980s](https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=airport+congestion&year_start=1800&year_end=2019&corpus=en-2019&smoothing=3)
    and [the late 1990s](https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-02-185). Airbus, in fact,
    based its development of the enormous A380 on the expectation that limited airport
    capacity meant that airlines would have no choice but to use fewer, larger planes.
    (The fact that this didn’t happen, and airlines instead chose to buy thousands
    of smaller aircraft like the 737 MAX, apparently successfully, is something I
    don’t quite understand.)

- en: Air travel is an interesting dichotomy. On the one hand, building the infrastructure
    for it is unbelievably difficult. Airports are incredibly hard to build, aircraft
    are incredibly hard to make a profit selling, airlines are frequently going bankrupt.
    And yet this hasn’t stopped air travel from steadily becoming cheaper, safer,
    more convenient and more ubiquitous. The pre-jet era, when aircraft and airports
    could be developed without spending billions of dollars, was also the era where
    air travel was noisy, inconvenient, and reserved for a relatively small number
    of people. It was somehow brought to the masses, transformed from a miracle to
    a modern convenience even as every aspect of it steadily got closer and closer
    to being impossible to achieve.
