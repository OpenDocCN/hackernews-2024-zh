    that data to third parties. It’s often unclear what’s being collected, and what's
    being shared and with whom. A recent *New York Times* article highlighted how
    [data is shared by G.M. with insurance companies](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/11/technology/carmakers-driver-tracking-insurance.html),
    sometimes without clear knowledge from the driver. If you're curious about what
    your car knows about you, you might be able to find out. In some cases, you may
    even be able to opt out of some of that sharing of data.

    companies that can piggy back off an app you may have installed, or the car’s
    own internet connection. Many of these programs operate behind dense legalese.
    You may have accidentally “agreed” to such sharing without realizing it, while
