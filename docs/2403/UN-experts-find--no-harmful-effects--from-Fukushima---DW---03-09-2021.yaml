    and explosions, prompted by a 2011 earthquake and a subsequent tsunami, is considered
    the world's worst nuclear disaster since Chernobyl in 1986.

    residents have been documented that could be directly attributed to radiation
    exposure from the accident", said Gillian Hirth, UNSCEAR's chairwoman.

    decade was not related to higher levels of radiation, but rather due to more thorough
    analyses that had led to more cases being reported. In other areas and countries
    without higher radioactive exposure, better monitoring had also led to increased
    numbers of thyroid cancer cases, the report said.

    two to three additional cancer cases were expected. The report said that other
    factors such as stress, heart problems and other illnesses came about as a result

    saw large amounts of radiation released into the environment surrounding the nuclear
    power plant, 220 kilometers (124 miles) northeast of Tokyo.

    flee their homes. It also caused three reactor cores in the nuclear power plant
    to melt. Compared to Chernobyl, however, fewer radioactive substances were released
    and largely settled in the sea instead of on land. Following the Chernobyl disaster,
    medical experts discovere larger numbers of thyroid cancers among local residents.
