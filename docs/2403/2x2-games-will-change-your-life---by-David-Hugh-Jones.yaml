    in 2006 for a weird thing called a Master’s in Mathematical Methods in the Social
    Sciences. Really it was just the first year of the Managerial Economics PhD course,
    but skipping the markets stuff and focusing more on game theory. The course was
    extraordinarily intense. I remember once being so tired I literally fell over.
    I complained to a newly-minted biology PhD, who just laughed and said “have you
    coughed blood yet?” He had been assigned to monitor petri dishes while he had
    pneumonia. Our political economy teacher, a mild-mannered Norwegian, set such
    difficult homeworks that we anagrammatized his name into Hard Bastård.

    Strange but true: I had been writing argumentative essays for 15 years, but I
    had no idea what an argument was until I did a serious maths course. Before, I

    Equilibrium, which sounds like a drag queen in heels. We learnt a nifty trick:
    if you have two players 1 and 2, you can refer to one of them as *i ∈ {1, 2}*
    and the other as *j = 3—i.* That’s how the real pros recognize each other. This
    was all great fun — the kind that might involve crying after 12 hours on a problem
    set — but I don’t remember much of it now. What has never left me is the simple

    If your intellectual pantry is well-stocked with ideas like loss aversion, the
    base rate fallacy and the availability heuristic, then clear a shelf and make
    space for these old, rationalist ideas. After you learn them, you will never see
    the world the same way again. Two-by-two games are everywhere. They are a shortcut
    to crisp analysis. For anyone in business or politics, not knowing them is a handicap.
    But they aren’t known! I see clever people argue in circles about some issue and

    both players are going to the ballet, or both players are going to the boxing,
    then neither player wants to change unilaterally. It’s not obvious what will happen
    here! Multiple equilibria make economists unhappy because they can’t give a clearcut
    prediction. Random events might affect the way the world works. Maybe a couple
    has a rule that if it’s sunny today, or if the weatherman is wearing a tie, they
    both go to the ballet, otherwise the boxing. There’s no logic to that, but it
    would be equilibrium behaviour — again, nobody would change unilaterally. If the
    world is full of multiple equilibria, then social science will be severely limited.
    But is it so?

- en: Yes. The Battle of the Sexes is *the game of politics*. You get a BoS whenever
    people have to divide something up. The game shows two ways to divide 3 units
    of payoff. If they can’t agree, the players get nothing. A more complex version
    would have any number of divisions, from player 1 getting 3, to 1.5 each, to player
    2 getting 3\. The logic would be the same.

    do, they both have an incentive to follow through. But the BoS rewards stubbornness.
    If you can hold out long and convincingly enough, the other party has a strong
    incentive to accept.
  id: totrans-split-38

- en: Another solution is leadership. In a BoS, if you can publicly go first, then
    the other person must go along with you. Once we add more players, it gets even
    stronger. If everyone knows what person X prefers, and everyone knows that everyone
    else goes along with person X, then each person has an incentive to do just that.
    A lesson of the BoS is that leadership doesn’t require special skills in the sense
    of a special understanding of the world. A leader is just someone who can get
    himself followed. Getting to be that person may require very deep social skills.
    But once you are in that position, it is hard to fall out of it.

    things can happen in a society, but what actually happens depends on one person,
    then you can only predict things by knowing that person well. No scientific laws

    Man theory of history is at least partially true.

    political systems, but we all prefer any settled political system to anarchy and
    civil war. What does a BoS with lots of players look like? Plausibly, a big enough
    majority (where guns and power may count for more than sheer numbers) can decide
    what the equilibrium is and make life very tough for any holdouts. But what majority
    will form? There are infinite ways to divide up a lump of money — such as the
    revenue from a whole kingdom — among many players. And for any division, you can
    find another division that will give all but one player a bit more. (Just expropriate
    one guy, and share the money around.)

    if both players choose the same outcome, Heads or Tails. Player 2 wins if they
    choose differently. There’s no equilibrium in this game. If 1 chooses Heads, then
    2 should shift to Tails, but then 1 should change to Tails too, but then 2 should
    shift to Heads. As rock, paper, scissors players know, the best thing to do is
    to be very unpredictable. Then there’s a “mixed strategy equilibrium” where both
    players pick Heads or Tails with 50-50 probability.
