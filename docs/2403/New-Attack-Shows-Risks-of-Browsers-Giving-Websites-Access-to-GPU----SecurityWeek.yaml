    the  University of Rennes in France has demonstrated a new graphics processing
    unit (GPU) attack impacting several popular browsers and graphics cards.**'

- en: The research focused on WebGPU, an API that enables web developers to use the
    underlying system’s GPU to carry out high-performance computations in a web browser.
    By leveraging this API, they have demonstrated an attack that works entirely from
    the web browser using JavaScript. This makes it easier to carry out remotely,
    but also limits the potential impact compared to previous attacks that require
    access to native GPU APIs.

- en: The academic researchers described their work as one of the first GPU cache
    side-channel attacks from within a browser. The showed how the method can be leveraged
    for remote attacks, by getting the targeted user to access a website hosting malicious
    WebGPU code and stay on the site for several minutes while the exploit is being
    executed.

    on the malicious site. No other type of user interaction is required to conduct
    an attack.

- en: The new method, the experts demonstrated, can be used for inter-keystroke timing
    attacks, which can allow inferring sensitive information such as passwords based
    on keystroke timing data. It can also be used to obtain GPU-based AES encryption
    keys within a few minutes, as well as for covert data exfiltration channels with
    transmission rates of up to 10 Kb/s.

    to other security- and privacy-related resources,” the researchers noted.

- en: Lukas Giner, one of the researchers involved in the project, told *SecurityWeek*
    that while the attacks they demonstrated are not “extremely strong”, they do demonstrate
    the potential risks posed by browsers giving any website access to the host system’s
    graphic’s card without specifically requesting permission.

    future), or websites simply using the GPU for things like crypto mining with the
    user being totally oblivious,” Giner explained.

    AMD, and nine GTX, RTX and Quadro series products from NVIDIA. The attack targets
    browsers with WebGPU support, which includes Chrome, Chromium, Edge, and Firefox
    Nightly.'

    might run while sensitive information is being processed. Because the entire system
    usually shares the GPU, this can include anything rendered (such as websites or
    applications) and general-purpose computing operations,” the researchers wrote
    in a [paper](https://ginerlukas.com/publications/papers/WebGPUAttacks.pdf) detailing
    their work.

    an [advisory](https://www.amd.com/en/resources/product-security/bulletin/amd-sb-6011.html)
    saying that it “does not believe that any exploit against AMD products is demonstrated
    by the researchers”.

    requesting microphone or camera access. The Chromium team, however, said it had
    found that asking users to make security decisions whose implications they don’t
    comprehend adds friction without making them safer.

    made available. It shows whether WebGPU is available and conducts a harmless attack
    in the browser.

    to clarify that this is one of the first GPU cache side-channel attacks from within
    a browser, rather than ‘the first’ attack of this kind. This was the first attack
    when the paper was being written, but others have since conducted [similar research](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.04349.pdf)
    with different targets.*'
