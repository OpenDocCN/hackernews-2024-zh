    soap bubbles, you name it. If a critter can perceive and manipulate the item,
    it’s fair game.

    can, you can dampen any garden in the world. With a hose attached to your house,
    not so much. The obvious drawback for fixed objects, even flexible ones like a
    hose or a hanging vine, is that your reach is extremely limited. From this come
    other limits on how you can combine one object with another or share. Portable
    tools can be passed around and passed on.'

    and human-like cognitive processes; tool use instead describes an action—a behavior
    that can be observed.

    capabilities. Anthropologists have asked: Which animals do things like humans—and
    therefore must be clever like our kind? What can these other species tell us about
    ourselves and our ancestors?'

    *their* worlds. What is important to those creatures, and how do they get things
    done?

- en: Scientists should also avoid lumping an entire species together when talking
    about “tool users.” As far as researchers have observed, [*most* individual chimps](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ajp.22284)
    do *not* use stone tools. And *most* dolphins, monkeys, octopuses, and crows seem
    to forgo tools entirely. Instead, this behavior, like many others, is often related
    to factors such as sex, age or stage-of-life, social role, or individual personality—even
    in [those leaf-sponging ants](https://elifesciences.org/articles/61298). For most
    animals, we know little about the pressures that prompt them to select, modify,
    and team up with pieces of their world.
