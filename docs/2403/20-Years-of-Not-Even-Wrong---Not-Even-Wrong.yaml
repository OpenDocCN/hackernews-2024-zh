    was 20 years ago yesterday, [first substantive one](https://www.math.columbia.edu/~woit/wordpress/?p=2)
    was 20 years ago tomorrow (first [one that drew attacks on me as an incompetent](https://www.math.columbia.edu/~woit/wordpress/?p=3)
    was two days later). Back when I started this up, blogging was all the rage, and
    lots of other blogs about fundamental physics were starting around the same time.
    Almost all of these have gone dormant, with Sabine Hossenfelder’s Backreaction
    one notable exception. She and some others (like Sean Carroll) have largely moved
    to video, which seems to be the thing to do to communicate with as many people
    as possible. There are people who do “micro-blogging” on Twitter, with the descendant
    of Lubos Motl’s blog [StringKing42069 on Twitter](https://twitter.com/stringking42069).
    I remain mystified why anyone thinks it’s a good idea to discuss complex issues
    of theoretical physics in the Twitter format, flooded with all sorts of random
    stupidity.

  zh: 这个[博客的第一篇文章](https://www.math.columbia.edu/~woit/wordpress/?p=1)是20年前的昨天发表的，[第一个实质性文章](https://www.math.columbia.edu/~woit/wordpress/?p=2)是20年前的明天（第一个[引发人们攻击我无能的文章](https://www.math.columbia.edu/~woit/wordpress/?p=3)是两天后）。当我开始这个博客时，博客写作非常流行，许多关于基础物理的其他博客也在那个时候开始。几乎所有这些博客现在都已经不活跃了，其中萨宾·霍森菲尔德的Backreaction是一个显著的例外。她和其他一些人（比如肖恩·卡罗尔）主要转向了视频，这似乎是与尽可能多的人沟通的一种方式。还有些人在Twitter上进行“微博客”，其中包括Lubos
    Motl的博客的后继者[StringKing42069 on Twitter](https://twitter.com/stringking42069)。我仍然不明白为什么有人认为在Twitter的格式中讨论理论物理的复杂问题是个好主意，其中充斥着各种各样的随机愚蠢。
- en: Looking back on what I was writing 20 years ago it seems to me to have held
    up well, and there is very little that I would change. The LHC experiments have
    told us that the Standard Model Higgs is there, and that supersymmetry is not,
    but these were always seen as the most likely results.

  zh: 回顾我20年前写的东西，我觉得它们仍然很有价值，而且很少有东西需要改变。LHC实验告诉我们，标准模型的希格斯粒子确实存在，而超对称性则不存在，但这些一直被视为最可能的结果。
- en: My point of view on things has changed since then, especially in recent years.
    When I started the blog I was 20 years past my Ph.D., in the middle of some sort
    of an odd career. Today I’m 66, 40 years past the Ph.D., much closer to the end
    of a career and a life than to a beginning. In 2004 I was looking at nearly twenty
    years of domination of fundamental theory by a speculative idea that to me had
    never looked promising and by then was clearly a failure. 20 years later this
    story has become highly disturbing. The refusal to admit failure and move on has
    to a large degree killed off the field as a serious science.

  zh: 我对事物的看法自那时以来发生了变化，特别是最近几年。当我开始写这个博客时，我已经博士毕业20年了，在某种奇怪的职业生涯中间。如今我66岁了，博士毕业已经40年了，离职业和生命的结束更近了一些，而不是开始。到2004年，我看到了近20年来基础理论被一种从未看起来有前景的投机理念所主导，而到那时，这种理念显然已经失败了。20年后，这个故事变得非常令人不安。拒绝承认失败并继续下去在很大程度上已经扼杀了这个领域作为一门严肃的科学。
- en: 'The technical difficulties involved in reaching higher energy scales at this
    point makes it all too likely that I’m not going to see any significant new data
    about what the world looks like above the TeV scale during my lifetime. Without
    experiment to keep it honest, fundamental theory has seriously gone off the rails
    in a way which looks to me irreparable. With the Standard Model so extremely successful
    and no hints from experiment about how to improve it, it’s now been about 50 years
    that this has been a subject in which it is very difficult to make progress. I’ve
    always been an admitted elitist: in the face of a really hard problem, only a
    very talented person trained as well as possible and surrounded by the right intellectual
    environment is likely to be able to get somewhere.'

  zh: 目前在达到更高能量尺度方面的技术困难使得我在有生之年可能看不到任何关于TeV尺度以上世界长什么样的显著新数据。在没有实验数据来保持诚实的情况下，基础理论在我看来已经严重偏离轨道，这种情况似乎是无法挽救的。由于标准模型非常成功，并且实验没有任何关于如何改进它的线索，现在已经有大约50年了，这个主题在其中非常难以取得进展。我一直承认自己是精英主义者：面对一个真正困难的问题，只有一个经过充分训练并处于正确智力环境中的非常有才能的人才可能会有所作为。
- en: My background has been at the elite institutions that are supposed to be providing
    this kind of training and working environment. Harvard and Princeton gave me this
    sort of training in 1975-1984 and I think did a good job of it at the time, but
    from what I can tell things are now quite different. 40 years of training generations
    of students in a failed research program has taken its toll on the subject. I
    remember well what it was like to be an ambitious student at these places, determined
    to get as quickly as possible to the frontiers of knowledge, which in those times
    meant learning gauge field theory. These days it unfortunately means putting a
    lot of effort into reading Polchinski, and becoming expert in the technology of
    failed ideas.

  zh: 我的背景来自那些本应提供这类培训和工作环境的精英机构。哈佛和普林斯顿在1975年至1984年间给了我这样的培训，我认为那时候做得很好，但据我所知，现在情况大不相同了。40年来，在一个失败的研究计划中培养了几代学生，这已经对学科产生了影响。我清楚地记得，在这些地方作为一个雄心勃勃的学生是什么感觉，决心尽快进入知识的前沿，而在那个时代，这意味着学习规范场理论。不幸的是，如今这意味着要花费大量精力阅读波尔钦斯基，并成为失败理念技术的专家。
- en: One recent incident that destroyed my remaining hopes for the institutions I
    had always still had some faith in was [the program discussed here](https://www.math.columbia.edu/~woit/wordpress/?p=13770),
    which made me physically ill. It made it completely clear that the leaders of
    this subject will never admit what has happened, no matter how bad it gets. Also
    having a lot of impact on me was the [Wormhole Publicity Stunt](https://www.math.columbia.edu/~woit/wordpress/?cat=34),
    which showed that the problem is not just refusing to face up to the past, but
    willingness to sign onto an awful view of the future, as long as it brings in
    funding and can be sold as vindication of the past. [Watching the director of
    the IAS explain that this was comparable to the 1919 experimental evidence for
    GR](https://www.math.columbia.edu/~woit/wordpress/?p=13229) surely made more than
    a few of those in attendance at least queasy. This particular stunt may have jumped
    the shark, but what’s likely coming next looks no better (replace quantum computing
    with AI).

- en: The strange thing is that while the wider world and the subject I care most
    about have been descending into an ever more depressing environment of tribalistic
    behavior and intellectual collapse, on a personal level things are going very
    well. In particular I’m ever more optimistic about some new ideas and enjoying
    trying to make progress with them, seeing several promising directions. Whatever
    years I have available to think about these things are looking like they should
    be intellectually rewarding ones. Locally, I’m looking forward to what the next
    twenty years will bring (if I make it through them…), while on a larger scale
    I’m dreading seeing what will happen.
