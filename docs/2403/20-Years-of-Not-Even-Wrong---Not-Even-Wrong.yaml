- en: The [first entry on this blog](https://www.math.columbia.edu/~woit/wordpress/?p=1)
    was 20 years ago yesterday, [first substantive one](https://www.math.columbia.edu/~woit/wordpress/?p=2)
    was 20 years ago tomorrow (first [one that drew attacks on me as an incompetent](https://www.math.columbia.edu/~woit/wordpress/?p=3)
    was two days later). Back when I started this up, blogging was all the rage, and
    lots of other blogs about fundamental physics were starting around the same time.
    Almost all of these have gone dormant, with Sabine Hossenfelder’s Backreaction
    one notable exception. She and some others (like Sean Carroll) have largely moved
    to video, which seems to be the thing to do to communicate with as many people
    as possible. There are people who do “micro-blogging” on Twitter, with the descendant
    of Lubos Motl’s blog [StringKing42069 on Twitter](https://twitter.com/stringking42069).
    I remain mystified why anyone thinks it’s a good idea to discuss complex issues
    of theoretical physics in the Twitter format, flooded with all sorts of random
    stupidity.

    up well, and there is very little that I would change. The LHC experiments have
    told us that the Standard Model Higgs is there, and that supersymmetry is not,
    but these were always seen as the most likely results.

    When I started the blog I was 20 years past my Ph.D., in the middle of some sort
    of an odd career. Today I’m 66, 40 years past the Ph.D., much closer to the end
    of a career and a life than to a beginning. In 2004 I was looking at nearly twenty
    years of domination of fundamental theory by a speculative idea that to me had
    never looked promising and by then was clearly a failure. 20 years later this
    story has become highly disturbing. The refusal to admit failure and move on has
    to a large degree killed off the field as a serious science.

    point makes it all too likely that I’m not going to see any significant new data
    about what the world looks like above the TeV scale during my lifetime. Without
    experiment to keep it honest, fundamental theory has seriously gone off the rails
    in a way which looks to me irreparable. With the Standard Model so extremely successful
    and no hints from experiment about how to improve it, it’s now been about 50 years
    that this has been a subject in which it is very difficult to make progress. I’ve
    always been an admitted elitist: in the face of a really hard problem, only a
    very talented person trained as well as possible and surrounded by the right intellectual
    environment is likely to be able to get somewhere.'

    this kind of training and working environment. Harvard and Princeton gave me this
    sort of training in 1975-1984 and I think did a good job of it at the time, but
    from what I can tell things are now quite different. 40 years of training generations
    of students in a failed research program has taken its toll on the subject. I
    remember well what it was like to be an ambitious student at these places, determined
    to get as quickly as possible to the frontiers of knowledge, which in those times
    meant learning gauge field theory. These days it unfortunately means putting a
    lot of effort into reading Polchinski, and becoming expert in the technology of
    failed ideas.

    had always still had some faith in was [the program discussed here](https://www.math.columbia.edu/~woit/wordpress/?p=13770),
    which made me physically ill. It made it completely clear that the leaders of
    this subject will never admit what has happened, no matter how bad it gets. Also
    having a lot of impact on me was the [Wormhole Publicity Stunt](https://www.math.columbia.edu/~woit/wordpress/?cat=34),
    which showed that the problem is not just refusing to face up to the past, but
    willingness to sign onto an awful view of the future, as long as it brings in
    funding and can be sold as vindication of the past. [Watching the director of
    the IAS explain that this was comparable to the 1919 experimental evidence for
    GR](https://www.math.columbia.edu/~woit/wordpress/?p=13229) surely made more than
    a few of those in attendance at least queasy. This particular stunt may have jumped
    the shark, but what’s likely coming next looks no better (replace quantum computing
    with AI).

    about have been descending into an ever more depressing environment of tribalistic
    behavior and intellectual collapse, on a personal level things are going very
    well. In particular I’m ever more optimistic about some new ideas and enjoying
    trying to make progress with them, seeing several promising directions. Whatever
    years I have available to think about these things are looking like they should
    be intellectually rewarding ones. Locally, I’m looking forward to what the next
    twenty years will bring (if I make it through them…), while on a larger scale
    I’m dreading seeing what will happen.
