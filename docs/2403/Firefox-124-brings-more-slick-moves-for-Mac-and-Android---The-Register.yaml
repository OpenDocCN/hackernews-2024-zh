- en: You're most likely to notice the improvements in [Firefox version 124](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/124.0/releasenotes/)
    if you use Macs or Android devices. In this release, the [Android version](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.mozilla.firefox)
    now allows you to refresh the page by pulling down from the top of the screen
    – the standard gesture for most fondleslabs.

- en: 'On Macs, there are improvements to the way that the program works in full-screen
    mode. Firefox has had a full-screen mode for many years, but for a long time,
    it wasn''t implemented using the official [macOS API](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nswindow/stylemask/1644530-fullscreen).
    That became available via an [optional setting](https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/305883/firefox-on-macos-use-native-fullscreen-on-videos)
    about four years ago, closing [bug #1403085](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1403085),
    but now it''s on by default.'

- en: (*The Reg* FOSS desk has been working with Macs since the era of System 6, but
    in recent years has discovered that some youngsters use MacBooks like some sort
    of iPad-with-a-keyboard, running all apps full-screen all the time and switching
    between virtual screens with trackpad gestures, which baffles and bewilders this
    crotchety graybeard. Presumably such folk will be gratified by this change. Around
    here, we disable the green window control's full-screen behavior with the very
    handy [RightZoom utility](https://blazingtools.com/right_zoom_mac.html).)

    navigate around a web page using the keyboard, including following links or opening
    them in background tabs. This now works inside Firefox''s built-in PDF viewer,
    which will be handy for users with visual disabilities, as well as hardcore keyboard
    jockeys who eschew pointing devices from preference.'

    Lock API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Screen_Wake_Lock_API).
    This is useful if you're in the habit of watching movies within Firefox, but also
    for navigation apps, reading ebooks, and so on.

- en: There's more info in the [release notes for developers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Firefox/Releases/124),
    but this is a bit more niche. We hope that web developers will delight in the
    fact that the [AbortSignal interface](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/AbortSignal)
    now accepts [AbortSignal.any](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/AbortSignal/any_static),
    and that [WebSockets](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSockets_API)
    can now use HTTPS and relative URLs, although we must confess ourselves unmoved
    by these changes.

    Banner Blocker](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/cookie-banner-reduction),
    although users in some regions may get to enjoy this when browsing in Private
    mode. On the other hand, if you don't care for the annoyance, you could just use
    the [I don't care about cookies extension](https://www.theregister.com/2022/09/21/avast_buys_i_dont_care_about_cookies_addon/),
    or add the [EasyList cookie list](https://easylist.to/) to uBlock Origin.
