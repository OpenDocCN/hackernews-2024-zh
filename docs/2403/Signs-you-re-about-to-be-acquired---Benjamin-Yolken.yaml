- en: Over the course of my tech career thus far, I’ve been through two acquisitions.
    In each case, I was just a normal employee without any special inside knowledge,
    and found out only a few days before the deals were publicly announced. In retrospect,
    however, there were some clear signs in the weeks leading up to the announcements
    that something unusual was going on.

- en: My first acquisition occurred in 2013, when my employer, [MoPub](https://mopub.com/),
    was acquired by [Twitter](https://twitter.com). I had joined the year before when
    the company was around 45 employees. Over the course of that year, the company
    had done really well, and by the time we were acquired we had more than doubled
    in size.

  zh: 我的第一次收购经历发生在2013年，当时我的雇主是[MoPub](https://mopub.com/)，后来被[Twitter](https://twitter.com)收购。我在公司的第一年加入时，公司大约有45名员工。在那一年的时间里，公司表现非常出色，到被收购时，公司规模已经翻了一番多。
- en: The second acquisition happened in 2020 (just a few weeks ago!), when [Segment](https://segment.com/)
    was bought by [Twilio](https://twilio.com). As with MoPub, this happened about
    a year after I started. But, in this case, I had joined the company at a much
    later stage, when it was around 500 employees, and growth was a bit lower.

- en: Getting a multi-hundred million or multi-billion dollar acquisition deal across
    the line requires a massive amount of effort. It starts with initial discussions
    then evolves into full-fledged negotiations, sometimes with multiple suitors at
    once. Once the outline of a deal is reached, the potential acquirer spends several
    weeks doing due diligence and peppering company insiders with detailed questions
    about the business.

  zh: 完成一个几亿或几十亿美元的收购交易需要大量的努力。它从最初的讨论开始，然后发展成全面的谈判，有时候甚至同时进行多方面的竞争。一旦达成交易框架，潜在收购方会花费数周时间进行尽职调查，并向公司内部人员提出关于业务的详细问题。
- en: Dealing with all this plus the prospect of a massive payday down the line is
    super distracting. Unless you’re an amazing actor (which few people are), it’s
    hard to pretend that you’re still super excited about the weekly product plan,
    the company’s regular all-hands meetings, and other mundane, day-to-day operational
    details.

  zh: 处理所有这些事情，加上未来可能获得巨额收益的前景，会极大地分散注意力。除非你是一个了不起的演员（这种人很少），否则很难假装对每周的产品计划、公司定期的全员会议以及其他日常琐事还是非常激动的。
- en: In both the MoPub and Segment cases, I noticed this change in behavior in the
    founders and non-founder executives beginning a few weeks before the acquisitions
    happened. Everyone involved still did their day-to-day jobs, but they became much
    more distant, as if they were preoccupied with something bigger.

  zh: 在MoPub和Segment的情况中，我注意到在收购发生几周前，创始人和非创始人执行人员的行为出现了变化。所有参与的人依然在做他们的日常工作，但他们变得更加疏远，仿佛心思全都放在了某件更重要的事情上。
- en: A single person going through this transformation wouldn’t be suspicious- they
    could be dealing with a personal issue or maybe they decided to leave the company
    and start interviewing elsewhere. Multiple people doing this at the same time,
    however, is too much of a coincidence and suggests that some big, company-level
    change like an acquisition is brewing.

- en: A big chunk of the due diligence process that happens before a deal is signed
    involves evaluating security vulnerabilities in the acquiree and then, as the
    deal gets closer, fixing any critical issues found. No acquirer wants to pay hundreds
    of millions of dollars for a company and then have hackers get in and steal all
    of the customer data and intellectual property.

  zh: 在签署交易之前进行的尽职调查的一个重要环节是评估被收购方的安全漏洞，随着交易接近，修复任何发现的关键问题。没有收购者愿意花数亿美元收购一家公司，然后让黑客入侵并窃取所有客户数据和知识产权。
- en: In the case of Segment, we had a strong security team that handled these issues.
    MoPub, however, had no security team and, in fact, had pretty lax security practices.
    In the weeks before the acquisition, I remember some of my colleagues going in
    and cleaning up things that no one had cared one iota about before, such as plugging
    vulnerabilities in our UIs and removing the numerous opportunities for [SQL injection
    attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL_injection) in our backend systems.

- en: At the time, I didn’t think anything of it, but in retrospect I should have
    been suspicious that these efforts were quietly going on in the background, without

    priorities.

    years is also time and money intensive.

- en: When an acquisition is going on, these activities can drop a few notches on
    the priority ladder. Executives and others become too busy (see discussion above),
    and large investments in talent could reduce the short-term value of the company.
    Moreover, it’s a little awkward to be selling candidates on your cool, fast-moving
    startup when you know that you’re about to gobbled up by a larger company.

  zh: 当一项收购正在进行时，这些活动可能会在优先级梯队上下降几个级别。高管和其他人变得太忙碌（见上述讨论），而且大量投资于人才可能会降低公司的短期价值。此外，当你知道你即将被一家更大的公司吞并时，在向候选人销售你的酷炫、快速发展的初创公司时会感到有些尴尬。
- en: In both the MoPub and Segment cases, hiring slowed down to a trickle in the
    periods leading up to the acquisitions. At the time, however, both businesses
    were growing a lot, and I felt that we desperately needed more hands on deck to
    keep systems up-and-running and continue developing new products. The urgency
    around hiring just seemed out-of-whack with the need. There also didn’t seem to
    be any urgency around retaining people who were thinking of leaving (and then
    ended up quitting).

  zh: 在MoPub和Segment的两种情况下，收购前期招聘减少到了极低水平。然而，当时这两家企业都在大幅增长，我觉得我们迫切需要更多人手来保持系统运行和继续开发新产品。对于招聘的紧迫感似乎与需求不符。而且，似乎没有对那些考虑离开的人员进行保留的紧迫感（最终他们辞职了）。

    what will happen when. A deal could be signed suddenly at 3AM on a Saturday night,

- en: A few days before the Twitter deal was announced, the CEO of MoPub summoned
    a bunch of us to the office on a Sunday. Nothing like that had *ever* happened
    before. At the meeting, he told us about the acquisition (this was when I learned!)

- en: At Segment, the last company all-hands before the acquisition was cancelled
    at the last minute. That had never, ever happened before. I never found out the
    real reason, but I suspect that the pending acquisition played either a direct
