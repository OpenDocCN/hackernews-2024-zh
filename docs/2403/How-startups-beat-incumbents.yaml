    worked when there were 1000 requests simultaneously with random failures. And
    we had to train hundreds of folks in tech support on the questions we anticipated,
    and train hundreds of folks in sales on how to leverage this to make sales, and
    work with marketing on how to message it. And we had to make sure it had close

    are zero-sum; without new customers entering the arena, winning one customer means
    a competitor cannot have that revenue. In growing markets there’s a steady stream
    of new dollars from new customers, so many competitors can grow. (This is yet
    another reason why startups should target growing markets, whether the goal is
    to build a small, profitable company or a unicorn.)

    specialized expertise. They can even over-spend, because their scaled business
    model can absorb a low ROI activity, intentionally losing money in order to stop
    competitors from using that channel. This doesn’t mean startups should *never*
    play zero-sum games, but they are more difficult, and sometimes impossible.

    example, “99.9% uptime” might sound excellent, but that equates to 44 minutes

    downtime, customers would revolt, and rightfully so. Yet, most hosting companies
    promise only 99.9%−99.95% uptime.

    99.99%, to say nothing of [the proverbial “5-9’s”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_availability)
    that industrial operations sometimes target. Every little rare, strange, unpredictable
    thing will knock you out of compliance; it’s expensive and difficult to solve
    all those cases. And yet, 99.99% just doesn’t look that different from 99.95%
    on the pricing page.

    at scale you have have no choice. Another reason is that it can win sales in some
    segments of the market; at WP Engine we have enterprise customers who have internal
    policies demanding 99.99% uptime, so we win against competitors with lesser guarantees.

    compliance to software reviews to vendor security reviews. For us, security is
    one of our main selling points, so this is important both for scale, brand, de-risking,
    and because it’s what customers pay us for. But that’s not true of most products,

    I doubt anyone is excited to build that, not even as an [SLC (MVP)](https://longform.asmartbear.com/slc/).
    For example, uptime is important for WP Engine, but for a SaaS product that is
    used only during normal working hours, targeted at a certain geography where “working
    hours” is a well-defined timeframe, having even an hour of downtime in the middle
    of the night doesn’t affect customers at all. A large, global company doesn’t
    have that luxury.

    safeguarding ownership of their intellectual property, and enabling sales to large
    enterprises and governments in various verticals who impose policies on their
    vendors. This is one of the reasons they can get multi-million-dollar three-year
    contracts and the start can’t. But it also severely hampers what they can do,
    or at what speed they can do it, or at what cost, and therefore at what customer-facing
