    his civil suit against the company in Charleston, South Carolina, earlier this
    month when he was found dead in his truck. Police say that he was found with a
    gunshot wound to his head in a hotel parking lot Saturday morning, March 9.

- en: In the complaint, Barnett’s lawyers Robert M. Turkewitz and Brian M. Knowles
    allege that during his seven years at Boeing South Carolina (BSC), located in
    North Charleston, South Carolina, Barnett made “numerous ethics complaints” about
    a “deep-rooted and persistent culture of concealment.”

    than he had planned because he was getting harassed at work for refusing to work
    in “the grey area” and not document defects. Barnett claimed he was getting passed
    over for promotions because his bosses were angered that he resisted their efforts
    to put production and profitability above safety and quality. Barnett said the
    abuse from upper management reached the point where he was suffering from PTSD
    and panic attacks due to work.

- en: Barnett claimed he, and others, were “pressured by Boeing upper management to
    violate Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Standards and Regulations.” This
    included failing to document remedies and defects on the 787 resulting in “an
    incomplete build record, which constitutes a criminal felony offense and has the
    potential to adversely impact the safety of the flying public.”

- en: Barnett was given Low Performance Management (PM) scores, he was separated from
    his team and moved to other areas in the plant, and blacklisted and blocked from
    transferring to other Boeing divisions outside of BSC. In addition, he was subjected
    to a gaslighting campaign in which he was harassed, denigrated, humiliated, and
    treated with scorn and contempt by upper management, which was calculated to discourage
    him and others from raising such issues and complying with the law.

- en: Among the major issues raised by Barnett was the lack of documentation of work
    done on 787 aircraft at the assembly plant. Boeing has a proprietary software
    system for the 787 Dreamliner called “Velocity.” All work and inspections, including
    defects and remedies, are supposed to be logged into the Velocity system. Failing
    to log or falsifying such records is a federal felony known as “Fraud involving
    aircraft or space vehicle parts in interstate or foreign commerce.”

- en: Instead of documenting repairs, Barnett’s complaint alleged that records were
    not kept, or were improperly documented. Barnett alleged there were “countless
    instances” in which parts from one plane were “being stolen” and “installed on
    an incomplete airplane without any documentation, traceability or engineering
    review. In most cases, the mechanic would come to work to find that the parts
    s/he installed the day before were gone.”

    the stolen parts problem and scolded him for “documenting” it in emails and on
    “corrective action” forms.

    was frequently being scolded for documenting issues on paper and in emails, and
    even, it seems, being too “knowledgeable.”

    wrote, “John is very knowledgeable almost to a fault.” This “knowledge,” the manager
    wrote, “gets in the way at times when issues arise. John likes to be right and
    at times rechallenges issues that appear to [be] resolved at a round table.”

- en: In the same review, under the heading “Delivers Results,” Barnett, who prior
    to being transferred to South Carolina only received perfect scores, had received
    a 2 out of 5 score. This “Opportunity for Improvement” was because of his habit
    of documenting issues in writing. The PM noted that “John still needs to learn
    the art of F2F (‘face to face’) engagement to address and follow up on issues
    instead of using e-mail to express process violations.”

- en: If just a fraction of the harassment, abuse and criminality alleged by Barnett
    in his whistleblower complaint, known as an AIR-21 is accurate—and there is no
    reason to doubt its veracity—then there is certainly ample motive for the Boeing
    corporation to silence this vocal critic.

    have claimed they found him dead in his vehicle with a pistol in his hand and
    his finger still on the trigger. Next to him was allegedly a white piece of paper
    resembling a note, but they have yet to state what was written on the note, if
    anything.

    the Holiday Inn where Barnett was staying. In the original police report, the
    cops acknowledged that the hotel had security cameras installed and facing the
    parking lot where Barnett’s vehicle and body were located.

    the 62-year-old man’s death a suicide, with the Charleston County Coroner’s Office
    saying Barnett suffered “an apparent self-inflicted wound.”

    a family friend of Barnett, recounted to ABC News 4 that Barnett told her prior
    to his death, “I ain’t scared but if anything happens to me it’s not suicide.”

    Turkewitz and Knowles, recounted their last days with their client. On Friday,
    March 8, “John testified for four hours in questioning by my co-counsel Brian,”
    Turkewitz said.

    Thursday. He was really happy to be telling his side of the story, excited to
    be fielding our questions, doing a great job. It was explosive stuff. As I’m sitting
    there, I’m thinking, ‘This is the best witness I’ve ever seen.’”

    claiming that Barnett, without looking at documents, could not have recalled details
    from specific incidents that had occurred a decade ago. Turkewitz recalled Barnett
    retorting, “I know these documents inside out. I’ve had to live it.”

    said Barnett told them he was “really tired and didn’t want to testify any more
    that day,” and instead, “wanted to drive home to Louisiana starting that evening,
    as he had planned. He’d told his mom that he’d be home on Sunday, and it took
    him two days to drive home. I suggested that we break for a week or two.”

    depositions could be taken until Barnett completed his testimony.” While Turkewitz
    didn’t think the judge would agree with the Boeing lawyers, Barnett relented and
    told his lawyers, “Let’s just get it done. I’ve already been waiting for seven
    years.”

    after he failed to show up to the Saturday deposition. Workers at the hotel searched
    Barnett’s room and noticed that all of his luggage was “packed up, but he’s not
    there.” After Turkewitz provided the workers with a description of Barnett’s “Clemson
    Orange” Dodge Ram truck, the hotel manager told Turkewitz that the truck was “Still
    there, and we called EMS. I can’t tell you anything more.”
