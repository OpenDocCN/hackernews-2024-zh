    than he had planned because he was getting harassed at work for refusing to work
    in “the grey area” and not document defects. Barnett claimed he was getting passed
    over for promotions because his bosses were angered that he resisted their efforts
    to put production and profitability above safety and quality. Barnett said the
    abuse from upper management reached the point where he was suffering from PTSD
    and panic attacks due to work.

  zh: 巴内特在他的诉讼中指控，因拒绝在“灰色地带”工作和不记录缺陷而在工作中遭受骚扰，他被迫比计划提前退休了10年。巴内特声称，他由于拒绝上司的努力将生产和盈利置于安全和质量之上而被忽视晋升。巴内特说，由于工作，上级管理层的虐待使他患上了创伤后应激障碍和恐慌性发作。
- en: Barnett claimed he, and others, were “pressured by Boeing upper management to
    violate Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Standards and Regulations.” This
    included failing to document remedies and defects on the 787 resulting in “an
    incomplete build record, which constitutes a criminal felony offense and has the
    potential to adversely impact the safety of the flying public.”

- en: Barnett was given Low Performance Management (PM) scores, he was separated from
    his team and moved to other areas in the plant, and blacklisted and blocked from
    transferring to other Boeing divisions outside of BSC. In addition, he was subjected
    to a gaslighting campaign in which he was harassed, denigrated, humiliated, and
    treated with scorn and contempt by upper management, which was calculated to discourage
    him and others from raising such issues and complying with the law.

- en: Among the major issues raised by Barnett was the lack of documentation of work
    done on 787 aircraft at the assembly plant. Boeing has a proprietary software
    system for the 787 Dreamliner called “Velocity.” All work and inspections, including
    defects and remedies, are supposed to be logged into the Velocity system. Failing
    to log or falsifying such records is a federal felony known as “Fraud involving
    aircraft or space vehicle parts in interstate or foreign commerce.”

  zh: Barnett提出的主要问题之一是在组装厂对787飞机的工作缺乏记录。波音为787梦幻客机提供了一种名为“Velocity”的专有软件系统。所有的工作和检查，包括缺陷和修复措施，都应该被记录在Velocity系统中。未能记录或伪造此类记录被称为“涉及飞机或太空器零部件的欺诈”，是一种联邦重罪。
- en: Instead of documenting repairs, Barnett’s complaint alleged that records were
    not kept, or were improperly documented. Barnett alleged there were “countless
    instances” in which parts from one plane were “being stolen” and “installed on
    an incomplete airplane without any documentation, traceability or engineering
    review. In most cases, the mechanic would come to work to find that the parts
    s/he installed the day before were gone.”

    wrote, “John is very knowledgeable almost to a fault.” This “knowledge,” the manager
    wrote, “gets in the way at times when issues arise. John likes to be right and
    at times rechallenges issues that appear to [be] resolved at a round table.”

- en: In the same review, under the heading “Delivers Results,” Barnett, who prior
    to being transferred to South Carolina only received perfect scores, had received
    a 2 out of 5 score. This “Opportunity for Improvement” was because of his habit
    of documenting issues in writing. The PM noted that “John still needs to learn
    the art of F2F (‘face to face’) engagement to address and follow up on issues
    instead of using e-mail to express process violations.”

- en: If just a fraction of the harassment, abuse and criminality alleged by Barnett
    in his whistleblower complaint, known as an AIR-21 is accurate—and there is no
    reason to doubt its veracity—then there is certainly ample motive for the Boeing
    corporation to silence this vocal critic.

    have claimed they found him dead in his vehicle with a pistol in his hand and

    claiming that Barnett, without looking at documents, could not have recalled details

    said Barnett told them he was “really tired and didn’t want to testify any more
    that day,” and instead, “wanted to drive home to Louisiana starting that evening,

    depositions could be taken until Barnett completed his testimony.” While Turkewitz
    didn’t think the judge would agree with the Boeing lawyers, Barnett relented and

    after he failed to show up to the Saturday deposition. Workers at the hotel searched
    Barnett’s room and noticed that all of his luggage was “packed up, but he’s not
    there.” After Turkewitz provided the workers with a description of Barnett’s “Clemson
