- en: The modern paradigm of programmers is destined to fall. Large autonomous systems,
    led by elite engineers, will replace today's corporate developers. Today's software
    jobs stifle intellect and creativity. The top software companies do not have worthy
    aims to anyone but brainless consumers and capitalists with weak values. These
    problems are carving a distinct new path for future programmers.

  zh: 现代程序员的范式注定要垮掉。由精英工程师领导的大型自主系统将取代今天的企业开发者。今天的软件工作抑制了智慧和创造力。顶级软件公司对除了没有价值观的愚蠢消费者和资本家之外的任何人都没有可取的目标。这些问题正在为未来的程序员开辟一条截然不同的新路径。
- en: The software engineer has become a cultural nobility symbol in recent years.
    Influencers across the world have cropped up to sell this dream to everyone with
    a computer. Computer science programs are overrun with people who ultimately don't
    enter the industry. There are more computer science graduates than there are programming
    jobs available. Does the world really need another corporate code monkey burdened
    with $50,000 in debt who will face unemployment in 10 years?

  zh: 近年来，软件工程师已经成为文化上的贵族象征。全球的社交网络名人们纷纷向每个有电脑的人推销这个梦想。计算机科学项目被那些最终不进入这一行业的人淹没。计算机科学毕业生的数量超过了可用的编程工作。这个世界真的需要另一个背负着5万美元债务的企业代码猴子吗？他将在10年内面临失业吗？
- en: Industry engineers continue to downplay the impact that the recent developments
    in AGI will have on the field. Currently, tech culture is still in its child-like,
    innocent phase. Corporate devs are blinded by their passion for their careers,
    which is understandable. You will not hear the truth from anyone working in the
    field unless they are particularly realistic, so the "experts" here are not a
    reliable voice of reason in a time like this.

  zh: 行业工程师继续淡化AGI最近发展对领域的影响。目前，科技文化仍处于幼稚、天真的阶段。企业开发者被他们对职业的热情蒙蔽了，这是可以理解的。在这样的时刻，除非他们特别现实，否则你听不到任何在该领域工作的人说出真相，因此这里的“专家”不是一个可靠的理性之声。
- en: Any time an “outsider” questions the soundness of the future industry, they
    are considered preachers of doom and gloom. It is the outsiders, however, who
    are able to lay judgment without emotional attachment to the field. It is outsiders
    who are more capable of an objective view, rather than the corporate fish from
    inside the tech-bowl. Perhaps the field is blinded by its own techno-optimism
    that has been shoved down our throats for the past decade through the “learn to
    code” movement.

- en: Historically, automation has led to a dip followed by a surge in the job market.
    This is the main empirical pillar on which the techno-optimist stands. It doesn't
    take into account the fact that AGI is only in its infancy. Moreover, past automation
    innovations were not able to mimic a general human-like intelligence. AGI cannot
    be treated exactly like past innovations. Consider all the tasks that could be
    automated by a human-like intelligence that is much cheaper, less error-prone,
    and capable of working 24/7.

  zh: 从历史上看，自动化导致了就业市场的低谷，随后出现了增长。这是技术乐观主义者的主要实证支柱。它没有考虑到AGI只处于起步阶段这一事实。此外，过去的自动化创新不能模仿普通人类的智能。AGI不能像过去的创新那样对待。考虑到人类智能可以自动化执行的所有任务，这种智能更便宜、更少出错，并能够全天候工作。
- en: In a future economy where intellectual labor is cheap and abundant, jobs that
    are focused on solving logical problems will primarily be done by computers. Only
    a miniscule portion of today's workforce contributes anything truly groundbreaking.
    Therefore, only the absolute peaks of human intelligence will be economically
    useful instruments for logical problem-solving. There's no need for AI to surpass
    the rare scientific and creative geniuses in order to displace *most workers*.

  zh: 在未来经济中，知识劳动廉价且丰富，专注于解决逻辑问题的工作主要由计算机完成。今天的劳动力只有极少部分贡献了真正突破性的内容。因此，只有人类智慧的绝对巅峰才会成为逻辑问题解决中经济上有用的工具。AI无需超越罕见的科学和创意天才就能取代*大多数工人*。
- en: Programming jobs are highly exposed to this potential displacement, especially
    those focused on solving *logic problems*. Programmers solve logic problems for
    a living, so this is an issue that they will come to face. Although large systems
    require a high level of creativity to integrate each component seamlessly, each
    component itself can be broken down into relatively simple collections of logic
    statements. The vast majority of component logic a programmer writes has already
    been written before in a slightly different form, and it is not novel in this
    regard. Directing an entire project is where the creative threshold is higher,
    especially novel projects. Developers with this skill will be more resilient amidst
    layoffs.

  zh: 编程工作极易受到这种潜在的替代影响，尤其是那些专注于解决*逻辑问题*的工作。程序员的职责就是解决逻辑问题，因此他们将面临这个问题。虽然大型系统需要高度的创造力来无缝整合每个组件，但每个组件本身可以被分解为相对简单的逻辑语句集合。程序员编写的绝大部分组件逻辑在某种程度上已经以稍微不同的形式存在过，因此在这方面并不具有新颖性。领导整个项目是创造性门槛更高的地方，尤其是新颖的项目。具备这种技能的开发人员在裁员中将更具弹性。
- en: The developers of the future can see the writing on the wall. Raw coding skills
    and even software fundamentals will increasingly be the strength of LLMs, not
    humans. Considering that the domain of logic is destined to become the natural
    strength of computer systems, humans will be forced to pivot. This is not to say
    that programmers should not care about logic, rather, they should not be *defined*
    by it. The programmers of the future will lean toward being technically advanced
    *artists*, not pure logicians.

  zh: 未来的开发人员已经看到了这个趋势。原始编码技能甚至软件基础知识将越来越成为LLM（大型语言模型）的优势，而非人类的。考虑到逻辑领域注定成为计算机系统的自然优势，人类将被迫转向。这并不是说程序员不应关注逻辑，而是说他们不应*被定义*为逻辑。未来的程序员将更倾向于成为技术先进的*艺术家*，而非纯粹的逻辑学家。
- en: A great programmer is more than a mere logician, and for this reason only there
    is hope for the programmers of the future. The best developers today are both
    artists and language-based logicians. Those who embody only logic and not art
    will die out after the further advancement of AGI. This is a different breed of
    developer than most corporate developers today, therefore a new selection pressure
    has presented itself, the *artistic pressure*.

  zh: 一位优秀的程序员不仅仅是一个纯粹的逻辑学家，正因为如此，未来程序员们才有希望。今天最优秀的开发人员既是艺术家又是基于语言的逻辑学家。那些只具备逻辑而不具备艺术的人将在AGI进一步发展后逐渐消失。这是与今天大多数公司开发人员不同的一类开发者，因此新的选择压力已经出现，即*艺术压力*。
- en: Ambitious artistic endeavors always conflict with corporate environments, which
    tend to stifle true creativity. Corporations are not seeking artists, but instruments.
    Artistic aims will be in permanent conflict with corporate interests. Even Google,
    a company known for cultivating creative projects, has failed to produce good
    software in years. Gemini, a racist language model, is a prime example of software
    which has suppressed creativity and taste in favor of corporate interests. Claude
    embodies moral ugliness as well, rendering it useless for many tasks. This artistic
    perversion exists in every popular piece of software today, and it does not sit
    well with the programmers of the future.

  zh: 雄心勃勃的艺术尝试总是与企业环境相冲突，后者往往扼杀真正的创造力。企业不寻求艺术家，而是工具。艺术目标将永久与企业利益冲突。即使是以培养创意项目闻名的Google公司，多年来也未能生产出优质软件。Gemini，一个种族主义语言模型，就是以公司利益为优先，抑制了创造力和品味的典型例子。Claude也具有道德丑陋，使其在许多任务中毫无用处。这种艺术上的歪曲存在于今天每一个流行的软件中，而未来的程序员们对此感到不满。
- en: This is not a call to entrepreneurship, as many have advocated for in the space.
    Providing value with software is incredibly important, but in a world where values
    are upside down, making software for the masses is often the wrong approach. The
    self-serving profit motive is both the source and downfall of modern technology.
    The superior software of the future will transcend purely selfish motives. It
    will provide value, rather than extract it. The developers of the future are abundant
    creatures who are not seeking to only extract wealth and time from the masses,
    but to inspire ever-greater human achievement. This software will not *suppress*
    human achievement through addictive algorithms, rather it will *facilitate it*.

  zh: 这并不是呼吁创业精神，正如许多人在这个领域中提倡的那样。用软件提供价值是非常重要的，但在价值观颠倒的世界里，为大众开发软件往往不是正确的方法。自私的利润动机既是现代技术的源头，也是它的毁灭。未来优秀的软件将超越纯粹的自私动机。它将提供价值，而不是从中提取价值。未来的开发者是充满激情的生物，他们不仅仅是从大众那里获取财富和时间，而是要激励人类实现更伟大的成就。这种软件不会通过成瘾算法*抑制*人类的成就，而是会*促进*它。
- en: Although the economic future of programmers is in question, the economic value
    of *most people* is in question.. In this light, it's not worth worrying about
    the economic value of programming in the future, rather, the *artistic value*.
    Software is a new medium for art, and the reason most modern software is purely
    hedonistic is because corporations are not capable of creating art. They are profit
    generating organisms that are generally not concerned with higher values. Only
    individuals can create good art. It follows that the best software in the future
    will be created by individuals, or very small groups, not corporations.

  zh: 尽管程序员的经济未来存在疑问，*大多数人*的经济价值也同样值得怀疑。在这种情况下，值得关注的不是未来编程的经济价值，而是*艺术价值*。软件是艺术的新媒介，大多数现代软件之所以纯粹享乐主义，是因为企业无法创造艺术。它们是赚钱的生物体，通常不关心更高的价值。只有个人才能创造出优秀的艺术作品。因此，未来最优秀的软件将由个人或非常小的团体创造，而不是企业。
- en: In this future world, there will be elite corporate developers, and independent
    artists. If you have not noticed, this trend is already happening today. There
    are a huge swath of programmers on the internet who don't work in the industry.
    These programmers are largely hobbyists, dreamers (people who want to break in)
    or freelancers. Considering that automation will replace most of the lower echelons
    of corporate developers, this trend will magnify until the techno-optimism bubble
    bursts. The developers who were only ever in it for the money will fade away,
    and we will be left with the artists and the corporate elite.

- en: The passionate developers who are displaced or have no interest in working a
    software job will continue building their own projects with the ever-stronger
    tools at their disposal. Similar to musicians and artists, the vast majority of
    them will be obscure. However, this is not to say that the art or software they
    create is without purpose. This points to a bigger ideological shift where software
    is treated like an artform, rather than a tool for generating wealth. The software
    of tomorrow should be judged on metrics other than just user count and profitability,
    such as its ability to promote human flourishing.

    either stagnation or enlightenment. The brutal economic fallout that may come
    will merely spur this new age. Many will fall into a hedonistic trap in a life
    without traditional work, where others will pursue higher aims that animate both
    themselves and their cultures. The rest will find meaningful work in social spheres
    such as teaching, therapy or healthcare. The inevitable result will cause mediocre
    people to forgo achievement, while others will become vastly fertile, if not with
