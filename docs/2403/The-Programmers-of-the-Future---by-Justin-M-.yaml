- en: The modern paradigm of programmers is destined to fall. Large autonomous systems,
    led by elite engineers, will replace today's corporate developers. Today's software
    jobs stifle intellect and creativity. The top software companies do not have worthy
    aims to anyone but brainless consumers and capitalists with weak values. These
    problems are carving a distinct new path for future programmers.

    Influencers across the world have cropped up to sell this dream to everyone with
    a computer. Computer science programs are overrun with people who ultimately don't
    enter the industry. There are more computer science graduates than there are programming
    jobs available. Does the world really need another corporate code monkey burdened
    with $50,000 in debt who will face unemployment in 10 years?

    in AGI will have on the field. Currently, tech culture is still in its child-like,
    innocent phase. Corporate devs are blinded by their passion for their careers,
    which is understandable. You will not hear the truth from anyone working in the
    field unless they are particularly realistic, so the "experts" here are not a
    reliable voice of reason in a time like this.

    are considered preachers of doom and gloom. It is the outsiders, however, who
    are able to lay judgment without emotional attachment to the field. It is outsiders
    who are more capable of an objective view, rather than the corporate fish from
    inside the tech-bowl. Perhaps the field is blinded by its own techno-optimism
    that has been shoved down our throats for the past decade through the “learn to
    code” movement.

    and AI could possibly lead to the further growth of the overall economy. It is

- en: Historically, automation has led to a dip followed by a surge in the job market.
    This is the main empirical pillar on which the techno-optimist stands. It doesn't
    take into account the fact that AGI is only in its infancy. Moreover, past automation
    innovations were not able to mimic a general human-like intelligence. AGI cannot
    be treated exactly like past innovations. Consider all the tasks that could be
    automated by a human-like intelligence that is much cheaper, less error-prone,
    and capable of working 24/7.

    are focused on solving logical problems will primarily be done by computers. Only
    a miniscule portion of today's workforce contributes anything truly groundbreaking.
    Therefore, only the absolute peaks of human intelligence will be economically
    useful instruments for logical problem-solving. There's no need for AI to surpass
    the rare scientific and creative geniuses in order to displace *most workers*.

- en: Programming jobs are highly exposed to this potential displacement, especially
    those focused on solving *logic problems*. Programmers solve logic problems for
    a living, so this is an issue that they will come to face. Although large systems
    require a high level of creativity to integrate each component seamlessly, each
    component itself can be broken down into relatively simple collections of logic
    statements. The vast majority of component logic a programmer writes has already
    been written before in a slightly different form, and it is not novel in this
    regard. Directing an entire project is where the creative threshold is higher,
    especially novel projects. Developers with this skill will be more resilient amidst
    layoffs.

- en: The developers of the future can see the writing on the wall. Raw coding skills
    and even software fundamentals will increasingly be the strength of LLMs, not
    humans. Considering that the domain of logic is destined to become the natural
    strength of computer systems, humans will be forced to pivot. This is not to say
    that programmers should not care about logic, rather, they should not be *defined*
    by it. The programmers of the future will lean toward being technically advanced
    *artists*, not pure logicians.

- en: A great programmer is more than a mere logician, and for this reason only there
    is hope for the programmers of the future. The best developers today are both
    artists and language-based logicians. Those who embody only logic and not art
    will die out after the further advancement of AGI. This is a different breed of
    developer than most corporate developers today, therefore a new selection pressure
    has presented itself, the *artistic pressure*.

- en: Ambitious artistic endeavors always conflict with corporate environments, which
    tend to stifle true creativity. Corporations are not seeking artists, but instruments.
    Artistic aims will be in permanent conflict with corporate interests. Even Google,
    a company known for cultivating creative projects, has failed to produce good
    software in years. Gemini, a racist language model, is a prime example of software
    which has suppressed creativity and taste in favor of corporate interests. Claude
    embodies moral ugliness as well, rendering it useless for many tasks. This artistic
    perversion exists in every popular piece of software today, and it does not sit
    well with the programmers of the future.

- en: This is not a call to entrepreneurship, as many have advocated for in the space.
    Providing value with software is incredibly important, but in a world where values
    are upside down, making software for the masses is often the wrong approach. The
    self-serving profit motive is both the source and downfall of modern technology.
    The superior software of the future will transcend purely selfish motives. It
    will provide value, rather than extract it. The developers of the future are abundant
    creatures who are not seeking to only extract wealth and time from the masses,
    but to inspire ever-greater human achievement. This software will not *suppress*
    human achievement through addictive algorithms, rather it will *facilitate it*.

- en: Although the economic future of programmers is in question, the economic value
    of *most people* is in question.. In this light, it's not worth worrying about
    the economic value of programming in the future, rather, the *artistic value*.
    Software is a new medium for art, and the reason most modern software is purely
    hedonistic is because corporations are not capable of creating art. They are profit
    generating organisms that are generally not concerned with higher values. Only
    individuals can create good art. It follows that the best software in the future
    will be created by individuals, or very small groups, not corporations.

- en: In this future world, there will be elite corporate developers, and independent
    artists. If you have not noticed, this trend is already happening today. There
    are a huge swath of programmers on the internet who don't work in the industry.
    These programmers are largely hobbyists, dreamers (people who want to break in)
    or freelancers. Considering that automation will replace most of the lower echelons
    of corporate developers, this trend will magnify until the techno-optimism bubble
    bursts. The developers who were only ever in it for the money will fade away,
    and we will be left with the artists and the corporate elite.

- en: The passionate developers who are displaced or have no interest in working a
    software job will continue building their own projects with the ever-stronger
    tools at their disposal. Similar to musicians and artists, the vast majority of
    them will be obscure. However, this is not to say that the art or software they
    create is without purpose. This points to a bigger ideological shift where software
    is treated like an artform, rather than a tool for generating wealth. The software
    of tomorrow should be judged on metrics other than just user count and profitability,
    such as its ability to promote human flourishing.

    either stagnation or enlightenment. The brutal economic fallout that may come
    will merely spur this new age. Many will fall into a hedonistic trap in a life
    without traditional work, where others will pursue higher aims that animate both
    themselves and their cultures. The rest will find meaningful work in social spheres
    such as teaching, therapy or healthcare. The inevitable result will cause mediocre
    people to forgo achievement, while others will become vastly fertile, if not with
    children, then with ideas, art, music, software and new values for a delicate
    age with an entirely unique set of historical problems.

    overcome it. Every movement in both nature and human societies creates new selection
    pressures, and an organism can either sink or swim. Rather than being afraid of
    this coming reality, I say we confront it head on. A question should often be
    asked of preachers of AI doom and gloom today, as to whether they are sick. I
    suspect this is the case.. However, being aware of madness and trampling over
    it is not a product of sickness. It's a product of *strength*.

    chaos, producing new symbols, new mediums, and new paradigms. Human society must
    go through an enormous shift to give rise to stronger values, a better type of
    programmer, and ultimately a higher type of human. Those who have much to give
    will remain overflowing, no matter the environmental conditions. The benevolent
    creatures among us will continue painting new software, culture, and solutions
    onto the societal canvas. The artistic programmers of the future recognize that
    not every problem requires code; writing code was a means, not an end. To any
    true artist, it was never about the money, but rather the ability to engage with
    the world, expressing passionately what one sees as the *truth*. These are the
    programmers of the future!
