    again, again marking them as if I had done it. (On IRC it was suggested that this
    might have happened because the PRs refer to forks that are disabled.)

- en: There was discussion if the master branch should be rebased to purge the malicious
    files. This would have been equivalent to dropping ([eight commits](https://git.tukaani.org/?p=xz.git;a=commit;h=e93e13c8b3bec925c56e0c0b675d8000a0f7f754)).
    The main benefit would have been that then antivirus software wouldn’t complain
    about them. Otherwise the files are harmless without the trigger code that was
    never included in the Git repository.

    (less work) and the benefits of rebasing seem minor compared to not-so-trivial
    downsides.
