- en: There's something I once read in an article which I can't find any more. It
    was something by a really young CEO of some unicorn startup type company, and
    it said things that people really did not like. It was the sort of thing that
    you should never say about other people. Actually, more to the point, it was the
    sort of thing you should never *think* about other people, but this person obviously
    failed at both. People gasped at the audacity of talking about it and kind of
    missed the fact that ... yes, people DO think that way. Even now.

    and has managed to not cash out despite being in the biz for a very long time.
    They've made no money, may be living paycheck to paycheck, and really need the
    job. Basically, the fact they're not "at the top" despite their age means they
    are crap.

    is deemed "old". Then, following from that, why can't they afford to quit? Why
    haven't they gone off to sail the world? What is their major malfunction which
    makes them unable to hit the jackpot? With all of the years they have put into
    this career of theirs, how have they managed to suck?

  zh: 在这五个词中，经理成功地表达了很多事情。首先，工人被认为是“老的”。然后，由此引申出来的问题是，为什么他们负担不起辞职？为什么他们没去环游世界？他们哪里出了大问题，让他们无法一夜暴富？尽管他们在这个职业中度过了这么多年，他们是怎么搞砸的？

    friends, like "Since you have all that cash, why are you still working". It was

  zh: 让我明确一点：这不是两位朋友之间的长句摘录，像是“既然你有那么多现金，为什么还在工作”。这是一个直接的对抗性问题，由一个太蠢的经理提出的，他不知道这样的话会让公司的律师感到紧张，因为歧视诉讼的起因往往更微不足道。
