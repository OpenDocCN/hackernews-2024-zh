- en: In 'Harbor Hues', a unique Zebra Puzzle, you will delve into the lives of four
    mariners readying themselves at the port for their upcoming voyages. Each stands
    apart, identifiable by the distinct color of his shirt, the sound of his name,
    the prestige of his rank, and the allure of his chosen port city in the USA. Untangle
    this maritime tableau by determining who is clad in black, green, orange, or red;
    whether Carl, Frank, Nicholas, or Zachary stands before you; which mariner responds
    to boatswain, captain, chief officer, or third officer; and who will soon anchor
    in Boston, Charleston, New Orleans, or Seattle. As the clues interlace, so will
    their stories, until alignment brings clarity to this seafaring puzzle.
