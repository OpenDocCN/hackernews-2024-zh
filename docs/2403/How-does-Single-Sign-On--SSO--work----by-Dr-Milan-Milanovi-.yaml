    login credentials, users may safely access several apps and services thanks to
    SSO, a user authentication mechanism.

    access multiple applications with a single login. This is accomplished using a
    central authentication server that stores the user''s credentials and verifies
    them for each application.'

- en: The idea of SSO is not new in the Cloud era. The on-premises identity solutions
    that enabled businesses to safely link their PCs, networks, and servers in the
    middle to late 1990s are the source of SSO technology. Around this time, companies
    started using specialized systems to handle user IDs, such as **Lightweight Directory
    Access Protocol (LDAP)** and **Microsoft Active Directory (AD)**. After that,
    they used on-premises SSO or Web Access Management (WAM) products to protect access.

    the example of trying to **access Trello using your Google account**. You don’t
    need to create a new user account on Trello and remember a new set of usernames/passwords.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For example, when you try to **log in to Trello with your Google account**,
    it redirects you to the central service hosted on accounts.google.com. Here, you
    will see a sign-in form to input your credentials. If the authentication process
    is successful, Google redirects you to Trello, where you can gain access where
    you are automatically signed in.

    credentials. These tickets are then presented to applications for access, eliminating

    due to security concerns like compromised servers exposing credentials.'
