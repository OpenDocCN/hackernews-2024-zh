    Russ & Daughters’ Super Heebster came to mind, but I figured mentioning a $19

    The *Times* had hired me to provide research for columnists and to solicit and
    edit newsy, against-the-grain op-eds. I brushed off my discomfort about the office
    politics and focused on work. Our mandate was to present readers with “intelligent
    discussion from all shades of opinion,” as the founder of the modern *New York*
    *Times*, Adolph Ochs, [put it](https://www.newspapers.com/article/the-new-york-times-adolph-och-new-owner/36760386/)
    in 1896\. This meant publishing arguments that would challenge readers’ assumptions,
    and perspectives that they may not otherwise encounter in their daily news diet.
    I edited essays by the [mayor of a small city](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/09/opinion/kentucky-coronavirus-economy-reopen.html)

    the right?” only to realize how unwelcome such questions were. By asking, I’d
    revealed that I wasn’t on the same team as my colleagues, that I didn’t accept
    as an article of faith the liberal premise that voter suppression was a grave
    threat to liberal democracy while voter fraud was entirely fake news.

    layers of editing, and greater involvement of higher-ups. Standard practice held
    that when a writer submitted an essay to an editor, the editor would share that
    draft with colleagues via an email distribution list. Then we would all discuss
    it. But many of my colleagues didn’t want their name attached to op-eds advancing
    conservative arguments, and early-to-mid-career staffers would routinely oppose
    their publication. After senior leaders in the Opinion section realized that these
    articles were not getting a fair shake, the process evolved. Articles that were

    Bari Weiss had predicted that Bennet wouldn’t last long: “He is doing what they
    claim to want but they don’t want it,” she told me. Once Bennet resigned, a new
    regime came into Opinion. Dao was reassigned to the national desk. Clay Risen
    moved to Politics, then to Obituaries. New policies were enacted. A “See something,
    say something” rule was affirmed, and a Slack channel called “op-sensitivity”
    was created, in which editors were encouraged to raise concerns about one another’s
    stories. By December, I had decided to leave the paper. It had been made clear
    to me, in a variety of ways, that I had no future there.'

- en: In the years preceding the Cotton op-ed, the *Times* had published op-eds by
    authoritarians including [Muammar Qaddafi](https://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/22/opinion/22qaddafi.html),
    [Recep Tayyip Erdoğan](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/07/opinion/erdogan-turkey-syria.html),
    and [Vladimir Putin](https://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/12/opinion/putin-plea-for-caution-from-russia-on-syria.html).
    The year of the Cotton op-ed, it also published the Chinese Communist Party mouthpiece
    Regina Ip’s [defense](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/01/opinion/hong-kong-china-security-law.html)
    of China’s murderous crackdown on prodemocracy protests in Hong Kong, Moustafa
    Bayoumi’s seeming [apologia](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/17/opinion/george-floyd-arab-muslims-racism.html)
    of cultural and ethnic resentments of Jews, and an article by a leader of the
    Taliban, [Sirajuddin Haqqani](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/20/opinion/taliban-afghanistan-war-haqqani.html)[.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/20/opinion/taliban-afghanistan-war-haqqani.html)
    None of those caused an uproar. Last year, the page published an essay by the
    [Hamas-appointed mayor of Gaza City](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/24/opinion/gaza-city-palestine-war.html),
    and few seemed to mind. But whether the paper is willing to publish conservative
    views on divisive political issues, such as abortion rights and the Second Amendment,
    remains an open question.

    policies; more likely the cause was enough blood having been let, and Donald Trump
    having left office (however unwillingly). On January 6, 2021, few people at *The
    New York Times* remarked on the fact that liberals were cheering on the deployment
    of National Guardsmen to stop rioting at the Capitol Building in Washington, D.C.,
    the very thing Tom Cotton had advocated.

    the Opinion section’s “commitment to publishing diverse views—including those
    that are unpopular, controversial or heterodox—is unwavering.” She doubled down
    on the *Times*’ claims that the Cotton op-ed “did not hold up to scrutiny” and
    that senior leaders weren’t involved enough. “None of that,” she added at the
    end, “was Adam’s fault. As a junior member of the team, he deserved better editorial
    support and oversight.” Please. What I and others really deserved were leaders
    who didn’t buckle under pressure and sacrifice their own to placate a loud and
    insurgent group at the paper.)

    days, I was attacked not only by colleagues, but also by acquaintances and friends.
    One friend contacted my girlfriend of seven years, asking whether she would take
    a stand against “Adam’s role in promoting fascism.” She—the tough-as-nails daughter
    of Peruvian immigrants who grew up hearing stories of her parents fleeing the
    Shining Path—ignored it, and some eight weeks later, we were engaged.

    end as a result of this episode, it’s even more painful to think that newsrooms
    haven’t learned the right lessons from it. If the *Times* or any other outlet
    aims to cover America as it is and not simply how they want it to be, they should
    recruit more editors and reporters with conservative backgrounds, and then support
    them in their work. They should hire journalists, not activists. And they should
    remember that heterodoxy isn’t heresy.

- en: By telling the story the *Times* told about Cotton’s op-ed, the paper seemed
    to avoid confronting the tough reality that despite many staffers’ objections,
    the article was well within the bounds of reasonable discourse. What did it mean
    for the paper and its coverage that *Times* employees were so violently opposed
    to publishing a mainstream American view?

    op-ed was never about safety, or the facts, or the editing, or even the argument,
    but control of the paper and who had it. In the end, all that mattered was that
    an example had been made.
