    out of a jar and then answer a question. My Starburst was pink, I believe, and
    so I had to answer the pink prompt, which had me respond with my favorite sandwich.
    Russ & Daughters’ Super Heebster came to mind, but I figured mentioning a $19

    it. But many of my colleagues didn’t want their name attached to op-eds advancing
    conservative arguments, and early-to-mid-career staffers would routinely oppose

    organizing against the op-ed and those responsible for it. “Is there something
    else we can do? I am behind whatever action we might take,” wrote Susan Hopkins,
    a newsroom editor who now helps run the front page, in the Guild Slack channel.
    By the end of the week, the Guild had a letter with more than 1,000 signatures
    demanding changes to the Opinion section. (When I pointed out to a Guild representative
    that its activism was in effect calling for one of its own members to face repercussions,
    he seemed surprised, and apologized, though the Guild did not meaningfully change
    its public tack.)

    it. In fact, Cotton’s essay was explicit in distinguishing between protests and
    the undeniable violence and looting: “A majority who seek to protest peacefully
    shouldn’t be confused with bands of miscreants.” (When asked for comment by *The
    Atlantic*, Danielle Rhoades Ha, a *Times* spokesperson, pointed to the op-ed’s
    language calling for a show of force to “deter lawbreakers.” She wrote, “‘Lawbreakers’
    would have included people marching without permits, refusing to disperse and
    blocking the streets. A fair reading of that suggests that he was in favor of
    military intervention against those breaking curfew or refusing to disperse as
    well as looters and rioters.” At the time, police cars were burning in glass-strewn

  zh: 即使在我二十多岁时认为我的新闻事业将因此而结束是如此痛苦，想到新闻编辑室从中没有吸取正确的教训更加痛苦。如果《时报》或任何其他媒体打算报道真实的美国，而不仅仅是他们所希望的，他们应该招募更多具有保守背景的编辑和记者，并支持他们的工作。他们应该聘请记者，而不是活动人士。并且应该记住，异端并不等同于异教。
- en: By telling the story the *Times* told about Cotton’s op-ed, the paper seemed
    to avoid confronting the tough reality that despite many staffers’ objections,
    the article was well within the bounds of reasonable discourse. What did it mean
    for the paper and its coverage that *Times* employees were so violently opposed
    to publishing a mainstream American view?

  zh: 讲述《时报》对科顿观点的报道时，似乎避免了直面这样一个严峻的现实：尽管许多员工反对，这篇文章在合理讨论范围内。《时报》员工如此强烈反对发表一个主流美国观点，这对报纸及其报道意味着什么？
- en: It was clear to me then and it’s clear to me now that the fight over Cotton’s
    op-ed was never about safety, or the facts, or the editing, or even the argument,
    but control of the paper and who had it. In the end, all that mattered was that
    an example had been made.

  zh: 当时很明显，现在看来，关于科顿观点的争论从未关乎安全、事实、编辑，甚至论点本身，而是关乎对报纸及其控制权的争夺。最终，重要的是树立了一个榜样。
