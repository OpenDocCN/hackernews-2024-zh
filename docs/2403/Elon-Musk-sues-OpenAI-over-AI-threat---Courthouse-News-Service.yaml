    betrayed an agreement from the artificial intelligence research company's founding
    to develop the technology for the benefit of humanity rather than profit.

    as well as Microsoft, from profiting off of the company's artificial general intelligence
    technology.

- en: Artificial general intelligence, a type of AI developed to autonomously perform
    on the cognitive level of humans, has been OpenAI's main goal and is demonstrated,
    Musk says, in its GPT-4\. The company released GPT-4 in March 2023, but according
    to Musk, it remains a closed model, in contrast to previous iterations — a move
    driven by commercial considerations rather than in the interest of humanity.

    to make a fortune selling GPT-4 to the public, which would not be possible if
    OpenAI—as it is required to do—makes the technology freely available to the public.'

    Microsoft to step in and force the resignation of the board members who attempted
    to remove him. The current board members, Musk claims, are no longer scientists
    and researchers who support and understand the technology.
