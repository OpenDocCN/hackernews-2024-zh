- en: Updated Cloud server provider Vultr has rapidly revised its terms-of-service
    after some netizens were alarmed by clauses that broadly demanded the "perpetual,
    irrevocable, royalty-free" rights to customer "content."

    by the Internet Archive, and this month users were asked to agree to the changes
    by a pop-up that appeared when using their web-based Vultr control panel.

    that granted the US outfit a "worldwide license ... to use, reproduce, process,
    adapt ... modify, prepare derivative works, publish, transmit, and distribute"
    user content.

    since before the January update; customers have only just noticed them now. Given
    Vultr hosts servers and storage in the cloud for its subscribers, some feared
    the biz was giving itself way too much ownership over their stuff, all in this

    Vultr in the past few hours rewrote [its ToS](https://www.vultr.com/legal/tos/)

    the prompt asking users to agree to an updated ToS was actually spurred by unrelated

    the biz told *The Register* the removal will be followed by a full review and
    update to its terms of service.
