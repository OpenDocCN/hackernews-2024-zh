- en: '[SSPL (Server Side Public License)](https://www.mongodb.com/licensing/server-side-public-license)
    is a license introduced in 2008 by the company "MongoDB, Inc" to lock down the
    usage of "MongoDB" which was, at that time, an open-source product. The SSPL is
    now the main license for products like "Elasticsearch" ([announce](https://www.elastic.co/blog/licensing-change)),
    "Kibana", and "Graylog" ([announce](https://www.graylog.org/post/graylog-v4-0-licensing-sspl))

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Presented as a nice solution to avoid some evil cloud companies to make profits
    without giving back to the community, this license is in fact a danger for freedom
    and a competitors killer. It simply lock down products that were open-source to
    commercial ones, hidden behind a false "free" spirit. Should we now call them
    "[freemium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freemium)" software? Probably.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: SSPL is a danger to freedom because [it is not an open-source license](https://opensource.org/node/1099).
    MongoDB, Elasticsearch, Kibana, and Graylog are simply [no more open-source products](https://www.elastic.co/pricing/faq/licensing#does-this-mean-that-elasticsearch-and-kibana-are-no-longer-open-source).
    The companies behind those products can now fully decide who can propose those
    products to customers and negociate financial agreements (that will not be publicly
    revealed), leading to the death of real competitors.

    any competitor. And without publishing their source code of course... They can
    have a deal with other cloud providers of course... with fees they will define,
    killing the competition and innovation.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It means that for us, customers, we will not have anymore the ability to choose
    our cloud provider. Mechanically, the prices of hosting will raise and the only
    choice we will have to fight back will be to dedicate a team to manage the hosting
    part on our own infrastructure... which is obviously what we all tried to avoid
    during years with cloud hosting solutions!

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Open-source people refuse to contribute to projects licensed with SSPL. It means
    that a lot of independent contributors are stopping to improve those products
    or developing plugins and modules. It means too that those products are now almost
    100% developed by the company behind the product. We saw in the past the problems
    that this [kind of governance raises with Node.js](http://anandmanisankar.com/posts/nodejs-iojs-why-the-fork/).
  prefs: []

    will ever contribute to a project that is changing its behavior to run against
    you? Having cloud companies contributing to open-source projects is a huge chance
    for all of us to get high performances, reliability, and security improvements.
    Losing those contributions is terrible for the community!

    competitors' prices and conditions. When a company controls the entire market,
    there are, in fact, no more competitors. There is just a false perception of competition
    which is way worst than no competition at all.
