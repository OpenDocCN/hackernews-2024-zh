    and ones that can [take a beating](https://youtu.be/rVlhMGQgDkY?si=FKZhJfj3GfokGfbO&t=105),
    but China-based robotics company LimX Dynamics has now unveiled a bipedal robot
    that can do both at the same time.

- en: '**The background:** Building a robot that can do one thing in one specific
    environment — think of all the bots currently working on assembly lines — is hard
    enough, but LimX’s focus is on developing “general-purpose robots,” ones that
    can do *many* things in many environments.'

    and a [wheeled quadruped](https://medium.com/@limxdynamics/limx-dynamics-launches-its-first-wheeled-quadruped-achieving-breakthrough-in-application-of-legged-8f5a56a1a51a)
    (if you were traumatized by the [Wheelers](https://disney.fandom.com/wiki/Wheelers)
    in “Return of Oz” as a child, maybe skip videos of the latter in action), and
    now, it’s added a bipedal robot named “[P1](https://medium.com/@limxdynamics/limx-dynamics-biped-robot-p1-conquers-the-wild-based-on-reinforcement-learning-253ad33eaca6)”
    to its lineup.

- en: '**Meet P1:** P1 is essentially just a pair of legs — think an AT-ST from “Star
    Wars,” but only about waist high and thankfully unarmed — and it’s trained to
    have “exceptional control and stability,” even when walking in incredibly challenging
    environments.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This training took place in computer simulations and made use of [reinforcement
    learning](https://www.freethink.com/hard-tech/reinforcement-learning-for-robots),
    a technique that lets an AI learn through trial and error, with “rewards” given
    when it does something desirable.

- en: '**Friendly hike:** To demonstrate P1’s capabilities, LimX filmed the bipedal
    robot at China’s Tanglang Mountain, where it encountered grassy fields, rocky
    ditches, and steep, brush-covered slopes — environments that LimX says were not
    included in the robot’s training simulations.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In the video, P1 is able to keep its balance remarkably well, despite the rough,
    unfamiliar terrain and the occasional abuse from its human companion — at one
    point, the man hits the bot’s legs with a tree branch so hard that the branch
    breaks, yet P1 stays on its feet.

    clear what the company plans to charge for the bipedal robot, when people can
    buy one, or what the intended use cases are.'

- en: Based on the demo video, though, it’s easy to imagine P1s being used for search-and-rescue
    missions, where it could team up with [cyborg cockroaches](https://www.freethink.com/hard-tech/insect-drones-cockroach),
    [robotic snakes](https://www.freethink.com/series/uprising/search-and-rescue-robots),
    and [scream-sensing drones](https://www.freethink.com/hard-tech/search-and-rescue-drone)
    to save people in peril.
