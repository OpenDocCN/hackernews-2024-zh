    some commonalities between good predictors. One is a tendency to think in numbers.
    Quantitative reasoning sharpens thinking in this context. “Somewhat likely,” “pretty
    unlikely,” “I’d be surprised.” These kinds of phrases, on their own, convey some
    useful information about someone’s confidence in a prediction, but they’re impossible
    to compare to each other — is “pretty unlikely” more or less doubtful than “I’d
    be surprised”? Numbers, by contrast, are easy to compare, and they provide a means
    of accountability. Unsurprisingly, many great forecasters, in Samotsvety and elsewhere,

    Series to date, the Yankees [have won 27](https://www.foxsports.com/stories/mlb/world-series-winners-complete-list-by-year),

  zh: 不过，在与Samotsvety团队交流时，"base rates"（基本概率）这个命令经常被提到。在预测术语中，"base rate"是某一事件发生的概率。如果我想预测纽约洋基队赢得世界大赛的可能性，我可能会注意到迄今为止119届世界大赛中，洋基队已经[赢得了27次](https://www.foxsports.com/stories/mlb/world-series-winners-complete-list-by-year)，基本概率为22.7%。如果我对棒球一无所知，这会让我倾向于认为洋基队比任何其他球队赢得下一届世界大赛的可能性更高。
- en: Of course, you’d be a fool to depend on that alone — in baseball, you have a
    lot more information than base rates to go on, like stats on every player, years
    of modeling telling you which stats are most predictive of team performance, etc.
    But when projecting other kinds of events where far less data exists, you often
    don’t have any more to go on than the base rate.

    knowing what base rate to use is itself a bit of an art. Going into the China/Taiwan

    that there’s a 5 percent chance of a lethal exchange in a given year. There are
    six years between now and 2030, so I got a 26.5 percent chance that there’d be
    a lethal exchange in at least one of them. After adjusting down for the odds that
    the exchange is just a skirmish versus a full invasion, and compensating for the
    chances that Taiwan beats China, I got my 5 percent number.

    I hadn’t thought of. Sempere alone brought up three. One was the rate at which
    provinces claimed by China (like Hong Kong, Macau, and Tibet) have eventually
    been absorbed, peacefully or by force; another was how often control of Taiwan
    has changed over the last few hundred years (twice; once when Japan took over
    from the Qing Empire in 1895 and once when the Chinese Nationalists did in 1945);
    the third base rate used [Laplace’s rule](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/Tg5pQCjpefFiqaKjw/limitations-of-laplace-s-rule-of-succession).
    Laplace’s rule states that the probability of something that hasn’t happened before
    happening is 1 divided by N+2, where N is the number of times it hasn’t happened
    in the past. So the odds of the People’s Republic of China invading Taiwan this
    year is 1 divided by 75 (the number of years since 1949 when this has not happened)
    plus 2, or 1/77, or 1.3 percent.

  zh: 但在我们的讨论中，参与者提出了各种我没有考虑过的其他基础率。仅Sempere就提出了三个。其中一个是中国声索的省份（如香港、澳门和西藏）最终被和平或强制吸收的速度；另一个是台湾在过去几百年中控制权更替的频率（两次；一次是1895年日本从清朝接管，一次是1945年中国国民党接管）；第三个基础率使用了[Laplace’s
    rule](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/Tg5pQCjpefFiqaKjw/limitations-of-laplace-s-rule-of-succession)。拉普拉斯法则规定，某件之前未发生的事情发生的概率为1除以N+2，其中N是它过去未发生的次数。因此，中国人民解放军今年入侵台湾的几率是1除以75（自1949年以来未发生的年数），再加2，即1/77，或1.3%。
