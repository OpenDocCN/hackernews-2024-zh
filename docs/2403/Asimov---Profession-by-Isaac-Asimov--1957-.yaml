    of childhood. A boy of eight takes many extraordinary things in stride. One day
    you can’t read and the next day you can. That’s just the way things are. Like
    the sun shining.

- en: And then not so much depended upon it. There were no recruiters just ahead,
    waiting and jostling for the lists and scores on the coming Olympics. A boy or

    to his family with one new ability.

    rain falling. (September for Reading Day; November for. Education Day; May for
    Olympics. They made nursery rhymes out of it.) George had dressed by the wall
    lights, with his parents far more excited than he himself was. His father was
    a Registered Pipe Fitter and had found his occupation on Earth. This fact had
    always been a humiliation to him, although, of course, as anyone could see plainly,
    most of each generation must stay on Earth in the nature of things.

    He would be bound to do well and he would have to, as he was an only child. If
    George didn’t end on an Outworld, they would have to wait for grandchildren before
    a next chance would come along, and that was too far in the future to be much

    unwound and was covered with a thin, wavy purple line. The doctor tore off pieces
    and put them into a slot in another machine. He did it over and over again. Each
    time a little piece of film came out which the doctor looked at. Finally, he turned
    toward George with a queer frown between his eyes.

  zh: 医生背对着他。从其中一台仪器上，一条纸条展开，并覆盖着一条薄薄的波纹紫色线条。医生撕下小片，放入另一台机器的槽中。他一遍又一遍地这样做。最后，他转向乔治，眉头间露出一丝奇怪的皱纹。

  zh: “我现在可以阅读吗？”乔治问道。他感觉自己没什么不同。
- en: The doctor said, “What?” then smiled very suddenly and briefly. He said, “It
    works fine, George. You’ll be reading in fifteen minutes. Now we’re going to use
    another machine this time and it will take longer. I’m going to cover your whole
    head, and when I turn it on you won’t be able to see or hear anything for a while,
    but it won’t hurt. Just to make sure I’m going to give you a little switch to
    hold in your hand. If anything hurts, you press the little button and everything
    shuts off. All right?”

  zh: 医生说，“什么？”然后突然而短暂地微笑了一下。他说，“没问题，乔治。15分钟后你就能阅读了。这次我们要用另一台机器，会花更长时间。我要把你整个头部都遮住，开启后你会一段时间看不见听不见任何东西，但不会疼痛。为了确保，我会给你一个小开关握在手里。如果有任何不舒服，你按下开关，一切都会停止。明白了吗？”
- en: In later years, George was told that the little switch was strictly a dummy;
    that it was introduced solely for confidence. He never did know for sure, however,
    since he never pushed the button.

- en: A large smoothly curved helmet with a rubbery inner lining was placed over his
    head and left there. Three or four little knobs seemed to grab at him and bite
    into his skull, but there was only a little pressure that faded. No pain.

- en: And then, with no real warning, a layer of thick felt closed down all about
    him. He was disembodied, there was no sensation, no universe, only himself and
    a distant murmur at the very ends of nothingness telling him something — telling
    him — telling him —
