    chronic fatigue syndromes and cure cancer?](https://bessstillman.substack.com/p/the-unexpected-gift-of-covid)”
    by saying that even though Post-Acute-Infectious-Syndromes (PAISes) like Long
    COVID can be caused by a wide variety of pathogens (viruses, bacteria, fungi,
    parasites, bad vibes from that annoying girl you knew in college), we probably
    don’t have to treat the pathogen itself to treat the PAIS. Research shows significant
    overlap in the pathways causing chronic symptoms, even if the initial triggering
    pathogen is unknown. It’s likely that multiple pathogens are responsible for triggering
    the same PAIS symptoms. If, say, 10 different bacteria, 15 viruses, and 2 fungal
    infections all trigger a biochemical pathway that causes a leaky blood-brain barrier,
    which, in turn, causes the symptom of “brain fog,” then one treatment for “blood-brain
    barrier problems” might work well.'

    after the body has defeated the pathogen. For example, you get COVID, then your
    body eliminates COVID, but the symptoms of Long COVID persist because the initial
    infection triggered pathways that lead to fatigue, brain fog and heart rhythm
    abnormalities. The virus is gone, but the PAIS, annoyingly, remains.

    chemical in the blood that signals that a certain pathway has been triggered—can
    be identified and tested for.

    pathways triggered by otherwise defeated pathogens won’t work if symptoms are
    caused by pathogens that actually remain in the body (otherwise known as "pathogenic
    persistence”).  Pathogenic persistence means that the body *can’t eliminate* the
    pathogen (the virus, bacteria, fungus or parasite) after becoming infected. Treating
    the pathways these pathogents triggermight help, but if you stop treating the
    pathway, symptoms are likely to come back, because the pathogen is still there.

    a cell to make any protein that corresponds to a protein on a pathogen that doesn’t
    normally exist in the human body. Once the cells started making the spike protein,
    or any protein the body doesn’t normally use, the body’s immune system recognizes
    the protein as foreign, and mounts an immune response against it. This is how
    the body creates antibodies, which act like immune memory. The immune system mounts
    a response just as it would if that protein was introduced to the body by a pathogen,
    except with the vaccine, your body learns to recognize parts of the pathogen without
    ever being infected.
