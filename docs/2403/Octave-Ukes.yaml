- en: To my ear, the octave uke sounds a bit like a viola -- with deeply resonant
    notes.  I've been exploring this idea in these YouTube videos below.  An octave
    ukulele is a baritone uke, strung with octave strings. It is a full octave lower
    than a tenor ukulele. Ukes are affordable, portable instruments which are a perfect
    first instrument for children -- or adults.  I'm particularly fond of the [Makala
    Baritone uke](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IrW7n7KqaIY), which sells new for
    $99.  Buy it at your local music store, when possible.  Your thoughts?  pshapiro

    a few other people with a similar interest -- and then ask your library if they
    could do so. (Please let me know if that happens.)  You are a member of your local
    Friends of the Library group, right?

    love to hear from you, too. I recently finished reading Andrew Schulman''s excellent
    book, [Waking the Spirit: A Musician''s Journey Healing Body, Mind, and Soul](https://www.amazon.com/Waking-Spirit-Musicians-Journey-Healing/dp/1250132223/ref=sr_1_1?crid=8YIQRJFTJT1J&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.p7td37sg0gIEii9sYIfnwA.fnfyXcoK2jnQbmrhI8PPeZOZfvUN2OMu4HltefVCOI0&dib_tag=se&keywords=andrew+schulman+waking&qid=1709274884&sprefix=andrew+schulman+waking%2Caps%2C66&sr=8-1)  The
    related 30-minute documentary, [Andrew and Wendy](https://www.aronsonfilms.com/andrew--wendy.html),
    by Josh Aronson, is also outstanding.'
