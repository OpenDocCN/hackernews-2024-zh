    offers a Linux version of its Basic PAYE Tools, which [the download page](https://www.gov.uk/basic-paye-tools)
    describes as "free payroll software from HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) for businesses
    with fewer than 10 employees."'

    there's also a version of the software that supports "Ubuntu Linux version 20.04
    LTS and 23.10." There's a detailed [User Guide](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/basic-paye-tools-user-guide/basic-paye-tools-user-guide)
    too, and more than one service status page, ranging from [rather dated](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/basic-paye-tools-service-availability-and-issues)
    to [extremely dated](https://customs.hmrc.gov.uk/channelsPortalWebApp/channelsPortalWebApp.portal?_nfpb=true&_pageLabel=pageNoNavigation_ShowContent&id=HMCE_PROD1_031142&propertyType=document).

    ever since. He tells us that he's had the software set to automatically update
    for about 15 years, and it's never failed before. He's tried it on both Ubuntu
    20.04 and a clean install of Xubuntu 23.10, among other things. Mac users [are
    also reporting problems](https://discussions.apple.com/thread/255234259).

    with them, and provided them with some troubleshooting information. A month later,
    he let us know that nothing had changed yet.

    acknowledges the existence of Linux, but supports it and offers Linux-specific
    downloads … but every silver lining has a cloud.

    if you have the software working or can help Donnell troubleshoot what looks to
    be a Python 2 and Django app, do let us know. It's a free download and he tells
    us that it fails before any form of employer's account is needed. ®
