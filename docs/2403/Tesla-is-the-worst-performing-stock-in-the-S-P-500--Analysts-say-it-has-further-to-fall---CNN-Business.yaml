- en: Tesla has been navigating through a perfect storm. The EV environment is getting
    more crowded right as the company’s fundamentals have come into question. Its
    share price has dropped about 60% from its 2021 all-time high of $407.

- en: But even with the recent drop in price, Tesla’s stock is still very expensive
    when compared to its actual earnings and profits, said Langan. The company’s former
    propensity for rapid growth is no longer certain, he said, and shares likely have
    further to fall.
