- en: For some inexplicable reason people often have trouble getting out of `vi`,
    the venerable and mighty UNIX editor. Given that the `vi` user interface is logical,
    and therefore easy to learn, this manual should be unnecessary. The world, however,
    is not what it should be.

    them to the elegance and simplicity of the editor.
