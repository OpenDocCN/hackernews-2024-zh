- en: I defined my letters around a central point, mid_x and mid_y. In hindsight it
    would have been better to work from a bottom left point and I’ll be adjusting
    this at some point, to help improve my kerning, which is currently inconsistent.

- en: Within a Letter class, I defined these key locations like x height, cap height
    etc, in relation to the font size and the mid point. For example, the full height
    from base to cap is equal to the font size. From y_mid to y_x is 1/3 of the full
    height.

    the height.
