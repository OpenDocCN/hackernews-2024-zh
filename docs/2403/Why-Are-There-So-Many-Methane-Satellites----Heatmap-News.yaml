- en: On Monday afternoon, a satellite the size of a washing machine hitched a ride
    on a SpaceX rocket and was launched into orbit. MethaneSAT, as the new satellite
    is called, is the latest to join more than a dozen other instruments currently
    circling the Earth monitoring emissions of the ultra-powerful greenhouse gas methane.
    But it won’t be the last. Over the next several months, at least two additional
    methane-detecting satellites from the U.S. and Japan are scheduled to join the
    fleet.

    in space that they are reducing global warming — not just by providing essential
    data about emissions, but by blocking radiation from the sun.

- en: Despite the small army of probes in orbit, and an increasingly large fleet of
    methane-detecting planes and drones closer to the ground, our ability to identify
    where methane is leaking into the atmosphere is still far too limited. Like carbon
    dioxide, sources of methane around the world are numerous and diffuse. They can
    be natural, like wetlands and oceans, or man-made, like decomposing manure on
    farms, rotting waste in landfills, and leaks from oil and gas operations.

    the most emissions, and consequently, about tackling climate change, that scientists
    say MethaneSAT will help solve. But even then, some say we’ll need to launch even
    more instruments into space to really get to the bottom of it all.

    Gases Observing Satellite, or GOSAT, by Japan’s Aerospace Exploration Agency.
    Previously, most of the world’s methane detectors were on the ground in North
    America. GOSAT enabled scientists to develop a more geographically diverse understanding
    of major sources of methane to the atmosphere.

    began campaigning for better data on methane emissions. Through its own, on-the-ground
    measurements, [the group discovered](https://www.edf.org/climate-impacts-methane-emissions)
    that the Environmental Protection Agency’s estimates of leaks from U.S. oil and
    gas operations were totally off. EDF took this as a call to action. Because methane
    has such a strong warming effect, but also breaks down after about a decade in
    the atmosphere, curbing methane emissions can slow warming in the near-term.

    Steven Hamburg, the chief scientist at EDF leading the MethaneSAT project, said

    ground. We can really reduce those emissions and we can do it rapidly and see
    the benefits.”

- en: In the years since GOSAT launched, the field of methane monitoring has exploded.
    Today, there are two broad categories of methane instruments in space. Area flux
    mappers, like GOSAT, take global snapshots. They can show where methane concentrations
    are generally higher, and even identify exceptionally large leaks — so-called
    [“ultra-emitters.”](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abj4351) But the
    vast majority of leaks, big and small, are invisible to these instruments. Each
    pixel in a GOSAT image is 10 kilometers wide. Most of the time, there’s no way
    to zoom into the picture and see which facilities are responsible.

    much finer resolution, with pixel sizes down to just a few meters wide. That means
    they provide geographically limited data — they have to be programmed to aim their
    lenses at very specific targets. But within each image is much more actionable
    data.

    of 12 point-source satellites, each one about the size of a microwave oven. Oil
    and gas companies and government agencies pay GHGSat to help them identify facilities
    that are leaking. Jean-Francois Gauthier, the director of business development
    at GHGSat, told me that each image taken by one of their satellites is 12 kilometers
    wide, but the resolution for each pixel is 25 meters. A snapshot of the Permian
    Basin, a major oil and gas producing region in Texas, might contain hundreds of
    oil and gas wells, owned by a multitude of companies, but GHGSat can tell them
    apart and assign responsibility.

    can differentiate between them,” said Gauthier. “You can see them very distinctly
    on the map and be able to say, alright, that’s an unlit flare, and you can tell
    which company it is, too.” Similarly, GHGSat can look at a sprawling petrochemical
    complex and identify the exact tank or pipe that has sprung a leak.

    pointing at specific targets, there’s a gap. “It might seem like there’s a lot
    of instruments in space, but we don’t have the kind of coverage that we need yet,
    believe it or not,” Andrew Thorpe, a research technologist at NASA’s Jet Propulsion
    Laboratory told me. He has been working with the nonprofit Carbon Mapper on a
    new constellation of point source imagers, the first of which is supposed to launch
    later this year.
  id: totrans-split-20

- en: The reason why we don’t have enough coverage has to do with the size of the
    existing images, their resolution, and the amount of time it takes to get them.
    One of the challenges, Thorpe said, is that it’s very hard to get a continuous
    picture of any given leak. Oil and gas equipment can spring leaks at random. They
    can leak continuously or intermittently. If you’re just getting a snapshot every
    few weeks, you may not be able to tell how long a leak lasted, or you might miss
    a short but significant plume. Meanwhile, oil and gas fields are also changing
    on a weekly basis, Joost de Gouw, an atmospheric chemist at the University of
    Colorado, Boulder, told me. New wells are being drilled in new places — places
    those point-source imagers may not be looking at.

    said. “If you combine that with clouds — clouds can obscure a lot of our observations
    — there are still going to be a lot of times when we’re not actually seeing the
    methane emissions.”

    leaks. Between the millions of sites that release small amounts of methane all
    the time, and the handful of sites that exhale massive plumes infrequently, which
    is worse? What fraction of the total do those bigger emitters represent?

- en: Paul Palmer, a professor at the University of Edinburgh who studies the Earth’s
    atmospheric composition, is hopeful that it will help pull together a more comprehensive
    picture of what’s driving changes in the atmosphere. Around the turn of the century,
    methane levels pretty much leveled off, he said. But then, around 2007, they started
    to grow again, and have since accelerated. Scientists have reached different conclusions
    about why.

    Some think it’s related to oil and gas production increasing. Others — and he’s
    in this camp — think it’s related to warming wetlands. “Anything that helps us
    would be great.”

    It will take larger images than GHGSat, each one 200 kilometers wide, which means
    it will be able to cover more ground in a single day. Those images will also contain
    finer detail about leaks than GOSAT, but they won’t necessarily be able to identify
    exactly which facilities the smaller leaks are coming from. Also, unlike with
    GHGSat, MethaneSAT’s data will be freely available to the public.

- en: EDF, which raised $88 million for the project and spent nearly a decade working
    on it, says that one of MethaneSAT’s main strengths will be to provide much more
    accurate basin-level emissions estimates. That means it will enable researchers
    to track the emissions of the entire Permian Basin over time, and compare it with
    other oil and gas fields in the U.S. and abroad. Many countries and companies
    are [making pledges to reduce their emissions](https://heatmap.news/climate/cop28-methane-limits-warming),
    and MethaneSAT will provide data on a relevant scale that can help track progress,
    Maryann Sargent, a senior project scientist at Harvard University who has been
    working with EDF on MethaneSAT, told me.

    are working. It could help with the [development of new standards](https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/IP_23_5776)
    for natural gas being imported into Europe. At the very least, it will help oil
    and gas buyers differentiate between products associated with higher or lower
    methane intensities. It will also enable fossil fuel companies who measure their
    own methane emissions to compare their performance to regional averages.

    the world. The project is limited by how much data it can send back to Earth,
    so it has to be strategic. Sargent said they are limiting data collection to 30
    targets per day, and in the near term, those will mostly be oil and gas producing
    regions. They aim to map emissions from 80% of global oil and gas production in
    the first year. The outcome could be revolutionary.

    poorly understood,” he said. “So I think there’s a heck of a lot of potential
    to work towards the sectors that have been really hard to do with current technologies.”
