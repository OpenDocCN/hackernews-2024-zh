- en: Airline deregulation in the United States didn’t mean that airlines *were no
    longer regulated*. In fact airlines are one of the most heavily regulated businesses
    in the country. Instead what it meant was that the government would no longer
    be the one to decide which routes airlines could fly, and what prices they had
    to charge.

  zh: 美国的航空业解除管制并不意味着航空公司*不再受到监管*。事实上，航空公司是该国受到最严格监管的企业之一。它意味着政府不再决定航空公司可以飞哪些航线，以及它们必须收取多少价格。

    ensuring prices were high enough, and competition limited enough, that airlines
    could earn a consistent profit.

- en: However when you set prices high, airlines compete for customer business in
    other ways. Each ticket was lucrative, so they’d spend money on customers – for
    instance on service and food and beverage – to attract more ticket sales.

    U.S. airlines entered into an agreement not to serve customers more than two drinks

- en: The CAB actually discussed whether they needed to *regulate the thickness of
    sandwiches* on board, because airlines were getting too competitive on food. They
    were charging high prices for tickets, but spending that money right back on the

- en: In 1958 airlines launched the first ‘economy’ service. This was strictly defined
    by world airline trade group IATA, to make sure airlines didn’t actually compete
    with each other on amenities offered. Airlines were allowed to serve coffee, tea,
    and mineral water to drink and sandwiches, which were supposed to be “simple,
    cold, and inexpensive.”

- en: Even that couldn’t stop competition, though. American carriers drove to limit
    food costs, and Pan Am and TWA offered options like roast beef, ham and cheese,
