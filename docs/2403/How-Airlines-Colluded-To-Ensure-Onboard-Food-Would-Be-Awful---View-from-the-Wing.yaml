- en: Airline deregulation in the United States didn’t mean that airlines *were no
    longer regulated*. In fact airlines are one of the most heavily regulated businesses
    in the country. Instead what it meant was that the government would no longer
    be the one to decide which routes airlines could fly, and what prices they had
    to charge.

    ensuring prices were high enough, and competition limited enough, that airlines
    could earn a consistent profit.

- en: However when you set prices high, airlines compete for customer business in
    other ways. Each ticket was lucrative, so they’d spend money on customers – for
    instance on service and food and beverage – to attract more ticket sales.

    U.S. airlines entered into an agreement not to serve customers more than two drinks
    back in 1956, but the agreement fell apart in 1971 as carriers competed for business.

- en: The CAB actually discussed whether they needed to *regulate the thickness of
    sandwiches* on board, because airlines were getting too competitive on food. They
    were charging high prices for tickets, but spending that money right back on the
    customer – and the government meant to stop it.

    sandwiches – at least for international flights.

- en: In 1958 airlines launched the first ‘economy’ service. This was strictly defined
    by world airline trade group IATA, to make sure airlines didn’t actually compete
    with each other on amenities offered. Airlines were allowed to serve coffee, tea,
    and mineral water to drink and sandwiches, which were supposed to be “simple,
    cold, and inexpensive.”

    food costs, and Pan Am and TWA offered options like roast beef, ham and cheese,
    and egg salad between two pieces of bread. Several foreign carriers defected,
    [most notably Scandinavian](https://scandinaviantraveler.com/en/aviation/1950s-the-great-sandwich-war).

    sandwiches popular in Scandinavia. SAS had 16 different variations and, to quote
    the Times, would “do something fancy with it, such as arranging it with a rosette,
    with perhaps a little pickle and radish added.”'

    than American, we will offer each passenger three sandwiches [free of charge].
    Of course, you can’t eat an open sandwich with your hand, so we will give you
    a knife and fork.”

    *Customers might choose an airline based on service* and that was supposed to
    be verboten. Swiss, for their part, claimed “everyman is entitled to his concept
    of a sandwich and we have ours.”

    and hear violations. The airline industry body declared that sandwiches had to
    be “cold… simple… unadorned… inexpensive” and had to “consist of a substantial
    and visible chunk of bread.” Moreover they could not contain anything “normally
    regarded as expensive or luxurious, such as smoked salmon, oysters, caviar, lobster,
    game, asparagus, pate de foie gras” nor could they feature “overgenerous or lavish
    helpings which affect the money value of the unit.”

    service standards.” Although in truth they *did* lower their standards – they
    acquiesced and ensured that “garnishing didn’t cover the entire slice of bread.
    At least 2.5 square centimeters of the bread had to remain visible.”
