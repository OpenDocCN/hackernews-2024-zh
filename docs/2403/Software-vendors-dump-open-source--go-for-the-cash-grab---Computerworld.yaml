    its main program Terraform’s [Mozilla Public License (MPL)](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/MPL/) for
    the [Business Source License (BSL) 1.1](https://www.hashicorp.com/bsl). Here,
    the name of the new license game is to prevent anyone from competing with Terraform.

    shopping itself around for a buyer?](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-03-15/software-company-hashicorp-is-said-to-weigh-potential-sale?sref=y7UfZ5i4) It
    didn’t surprise me.

    shifts. Again, you might never have heard of these companies or their programs,
    but each is worth, at a minimum, hundreds of millions of dollars. And, while you
    might not know it, if your company uses cloud services behind the scenes, chances
    are you’re using one or more of their programs,

- en: There is a threefold reason these companies did this. First, all of them, at
    one point or another, mistook “open source” as a business model. It wasn’t then,
    it isn’t now, and it never will be.

    they could make millions, other companies, usually the hyper-cloud providers such
    as Amazon Web Services (AWS), were making just as much, if not more, from their
    programs. They did it by providing their software as a service to businesses.

    a one-off they need to work on themselves.
