    as well as an app drawer and search. Devin spent time rewriting it from scratch,
    addressing the limitations that existed in Plasma 5, in particular the customizations
    are now tied to each page, no longer causing reordering issues from screen rotations.

    created a new settings service that automatically handles this situation. This
    allows for interoperability with Plasma Desktop being simultaneously installed
    on the system, and eliminates the need to install custom configuration.
