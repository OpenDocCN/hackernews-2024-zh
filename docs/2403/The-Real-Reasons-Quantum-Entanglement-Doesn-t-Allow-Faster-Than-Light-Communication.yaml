- en: My colleague-in-blogging Ethan Siegel does a regular reader-request feature,
    and this week's edition drifts into my territory, answering a question about [using
    quantum entanglement for faster-than-light communication](http://www.forbes.com/sites/startswithabang/2016/04/30/ask-ethan-can-we-use-quantum-entanglement-to-communicate-faster-than-light/).
    As I jokingly said on Twitter, Ethan's answer is pretty good for an astronomer,
    but there are bits of it I don't like. Not because he gives a wrong answer-- he
    correctly notes that it's not possible to use entangled particles to send messages
    faster than the speed of light-- but because there's a lot of subtle and complex
    stuff at work here. I've [written about this before](http://www.forbes.com/sites/chadorzel/2015/08/11/how-quantum-randomness-saves-relativity/#2a506baf2ce2),
    but it's useful to poke at this a little more because the phrasing I dislike ties
    into some fairly deep stuff.

    people, traditionally named "Alice" and "Bob" share a pair of particles that can
    each be measured in one of two quantum states, which we''ll call "0" and "1."
    These particles are prepared in an entangled state in which a measurement of the
    state of Alice''s particle is correlated with the measured state of Bob''s particle,
    no matter how far apart they are. That is, if Alice measures her particle in state
    1 at precisely noon in Schenectady, she knows that Bob in Portland will also measure
    his particle to be in state 1, whether he''s in Portland, Maine, Portland, Oregon,
    or Portland Station on one of the moons of Yavin.'

    — to *communicate* from a distant star system to our own? The answer to that is
    yes, if you consider making a measurement at a distant location a form of communication.
    But when you say communicate, typically you want to know something *about your
    destination*. You could, for example, keep an entangled particle in an indeterminate
    state, send it aboard a spacecraft bound for the nearest star, and tell it to
    look for signs of a rocky planet in that star’s habitable zone. If you see one,
    make a measurement that forces the particle you have to be in the +1 state, and
    if you don’t see one, make a measurement that forces the particle you have to
    be in the -1 state.'

    David Kaiser's [*How the Hippies Saved Physics*](http://www.hippiessavedphysics.com/)
    for the fascinating history of this whole business. And, in fact, if the situation
    described above were possible-- if you could measure a particle's state in a way
    that forced a particular outcome-- you could absolutely send information this
    way. But you can't do that.

    ask a particle, “what state are you in?” If you force an entangled particle into
    a particular state, you *break the entanglement*, and the measurement you make
    on Earth is completely independent of the measurement at the distant star. If
    you had simply measured the distant particle to be +1 or -1, then your measurement,
    here on Earth, of either -1 or +1 (respectively) would give you information about
    the particle located light years away. But by *forcing* that distant particle
    to be +1 or -1, that means, no matter the outcome, your particle here on Earth
    has a 50/50 shot of being +1 or -1, with no bearing on the particle so many light
    years distant.'

    communication to a different sort of operation, and it deserves to be spelled
    out. That is, in the original statement, you "make a measurement that forces the
    particle" to be in a particular state, while in the second you "force an entangled
    particle into a particular state" which breaks the entanglement. Those are not
    the same thing, though-- one is a measurement, the other is a change of state
    followed by a measurement.

    clear. So, imagine Alice's particle is one of the trapped ions that people regularly
    use to do quantum information experiments, which can be in one of two internal
    states. If her particle starts in a superposition of equal parts "0" and "1,"
    how would she go about forcing a definite measurement outcome, let's say "1"?
  id: totrans-split-16

- en: The answer is to do an operation that we would describe in words as "If you're
    in state 0, flip the state, otherwise leave it alone." For a trapped-ion system,
    this is done using lasers to drive a transition from state 0 to state 1 by way
    of a third state (the jargon term for this is a "Raman transition"). If you choose
    your states carefully, you can arrange it so that an atom in state 0 will absorb
    the laser and flip its state, but an atom in state 1 won't interact with the laser
    at all. This sort of selective absorption is how they distinguish between states
    0 and 1 in real trapped-ion experiments (state 0 absorbs a laser photon then re-emits
    the light, and repeating this a few million times a second gives you a bright
    spot on a camera pointed at the trap holding the ion), and a two-particle variant
    of it is how you entangle ions in the first place (the operation is "If Ion A
    is in state 1, flip the state of Ion B," and you give it an input state where
    B is definitely in state 0 and A is in a superposition of 0 and 1).

    Bob's particle in any way-- it's still in an indeterminate state that's a mix
    of 0 and 1\. It breaks the correlation between the measurement results, though--
    Alice's particle is no longer in a superposition, but only in state 1, so when
    Bob eventually makes a measurement that randomly picks 0 or 1, it doesn't necessarily
    match Alice's measurement, which is guaranteed to be 1.

- en: It should be noted that the "breaking of entanglement" Ethan describes is actually
    a slightly tricky thing to do, requiring a fairly specific operation to make it
    work. You will sometimes hear people assert that entanglement is fragile, and
    that *any* disturbance of one of the particles will mess things up, but that's
    not true. In fact, there are a huge number of things you can do to change the
    state of one of the two particles without destroying the entangled nature of the
    system, provided you keep track of what you did to it and adjust your final measurements
    accordingly. (I have a [blog post](http://scienceblogs.com/principles/2012/03/14/entanglement-is-not-that-magic/)
    and an [arxiv preprint](http://arxiv.org/abs/1208.6186) discussing this in more
    detail...) The impossibility of keeping track of all the ways entangled states
    get shifted is crucial to (the way I think about) the process of "decoherence"
    that plays a key role in [(the way I think about) the "Many-Worlds" interpretation
    of quantum physics](http://www.forbes.com/sites/chadorzel/2016/01/05/what-the-many-worlds-interpretation-of-quantum-physics-really-means/#71ae159531fc),
    which is what I was hinting at when I said this gets into some deep stuff, though
    this post is already running long, so I won't try to explain here.

- en: Crucially, though, this is not the sort of thing that people talk about doing
    when they talk about using entanglement for faster-than-light communication. What
    they want is a *measurement procedure that forces a particular outcome*. That
    is, they want Alice to use some woo-woo mystical process to ask her particle "What
    is your state?" and make it come out to be 1, thus instantaneously forcing Bob's
    particle into state 1 as well. If such a procedure existed, you could, in fact,
    exploit it to send messages (with disastrous consequences for causality); fortunately,
    [God plays dice with the universe](http://www.forbes.com/sites/chadorzel/2015/08/11/how-quantum-randomness-saves-relativity/),
    and the results of a quantum measurement are unavoidably random. Which means that
    while Alice and Bob end up with measurements that are perfectly correlated, no
    information passes between them. They can only see the correlation when they get
    back together and *compare* lists, and they have to do that at or below the speed
    of light.

- en: It should also be noted that the version of entanglement-based communication
    Ethan describes is a particularly naive sort that even fringe physicists mostly
    reject. A more plausible scheme for actually doing this would be to use different
    measurement bases to send information. That is, rather than "force the state to
    be 1 to send Bob a 1," Alice would ask two different questions of her particle.
    If she wants to send Bob a 1, she would make a measurement asking "Are you in
    0 or 1?," but if she wants to send a 0 she makes a measurement asking "Are you
    in '0+1' or '0-1'?" The latter operation puts Bob's particle into the corresponding
    state, which has a 50% chance of returning either 0 or 1 for his measurement.
    So all Bob has to do is measure that probability distribution for each particle--
    if it's either 0 or 1 with 100% probability, he knows Alice is sending a 1, and
    if it's 50% of each, she's sending a 0.
  id: totrans-split-22
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That scheme doesn't work either, for a more subtle reason. The problem is that
    you can't determine a probability distribution from a single measurement of "0"
    or "1," so Bob would need to make a lot of copies of the state of his particle
    in order to distinguish Alice's message. But there's a very deep result (that
    [Kaiser's book](http://www.hippiessavedphysics.com/) claims was directly inspired
    by these FTL communication schemes) known as the "no-cloning theorem" showing
    that this is impossible-- you can't make faithful copies of a quantum state unless
    you already know what it is. There's no way for Bob to unambiguously determine
    which measurement Alice made, so you're back in the scenario where Alice and Bob
    each have random strings of 1's and 0's that only turn out to be perfectly correlated
    later on, when they get back together and compare. [Quantum randomness saves the
