    correctly notes that it's not possible to use entangled particles to send messages
    faster than the speed of light-- but because there's a lot of subtle and complex
    stuff at work here. I've [written about this before](http://www.forbes.com/sites/chadorzel/2015/08/11/how-quantum-randomness-saves-relativity/#2a506baf2ce2),

    clear. So, imagine Alice's particle is one of the trapped ions that people regularly
    use to do quantum information experiments, which can be in one of two internal
    states. If her particle starts in a superposition of equal parts "0" and "1,"
    how would she go about forcing a definite measurement outcome, let's say "1"?

  zh: 想要清楚地区分这一点，想象一下这个具体实现会有所帮助。因此，想象Alice的粒子是人们经常用来进行量子信息实验的囚禁离子之一，可以处于两种内部状态中的任一种。如果她的粒子起初处于等量部分的“0”和“1”的叠加态，她将如何强制产生一个明确的测量结果，比如说“1”？
- en: The answer is to do an operation that we would describe in words as "If you're
    in state 0, flip the state, otherwise leave it alone." For a trapped-ion system,
    this is done using lasers to drive a transition from state 0 to state 1 by way
    of a third state (the jargon term for this is a "Raman transition"). If you choose
    your states carefully, you can arrange it so that an atom in state 0 will absorb
    the laser and flip its state, but an atom in state 1 won't interact with the laser
    at all. This sort of selective absorption is how they distinguish between states
    0 and 1 in real trapped-ion experiments (state 0 absorbs a laser photon then re-emits
    the light, and repeating this a few million times a second gives you a bright
    spot on a camera pointed at the trap holding the ion), and a two-particle variant
    of it is how you entangle ions in the first place (the operation is "If Ion A
    is in state 1, flip the state of Ion B," and you give it an input state where
    B is definitely in state 0 and A is in a superposition of 0 and 1).

  zh: 答案是执行一个我们用文字描述为“如果你处于状态0，则翻转状态，否则保持不变”的操作。对于囚禁离子系统，这是通过激光驱动从状态0到状态1的转变来完成的，中间还会经过第三种状态（术语称之为“拉曼跃迁”）。如果你仔细选择状态，可以安排使得处于状态0的原子吸收激光并翻转其状态，而处于状态1的原子则完全不与激光发生相互作用。这种选择性吸收是真实囚禁离子实验中区分状态0和1的方法（状态0吸收激光光子然后重新发出光，每秒重复几百万次，在指向离子囚禁点的摄像机上形成明亮的斑点），而其两粒子变体是如何首先纠缠离子的（操作为“如果离子A处于状态1，则翻转离子B的状态”，并给出一个输入状态，其中B肯定处于状态0，而A处于0和1的叠加态）。
- en: If Alice does this on her particle, it does not, in fact, affect the state of
    Bob's particle in any way-- it's still in an indeterminate state that's a mix
    of 0 and 1\. It breaks the correlation between the measurement results, though--
    Alice's particle is no longer in a superposition, but only in state 1, so when
    Bob eventually makes a measurement that randomly picks 0 or 1, it doesn't necessarily
    match Alice's measurement, which is guaranteed to be 1.

  zh: 如果Alice对她的粒子执行这个操作，实际上并不会以任何方式影响Bob粒子的状态——它仍然处于一个不确定的混合状态，包含0和1。不过，它确实打破了测量结果之间的相关性——Alice的粒子不再处于叠加态，而只处于状态1，因此当Bob最终进行随机选择0或1的测量时，它不一定与Alice的测量结果匹配，而后者保证是1。
- en: It should be noted that the "breaking of entanglement" Ethan describes is actually
    a slightly tricky thing to do, requiring a fairly specific operation to make it
    work. You will sometimes hear people assert that entanglement is fragile, and
    that *any* disturbance of one of the particles will mess things up, but that's
    not true. In fact, there are a huge number of things you can do to change the
    state of one of the two particles without destroying the entangled nature of the
    system, provided you keep track of what you did to it and adjust your final measurements
    accordingly. (I have a [blog post](http://scienceblogs.com/principles/2012/03/14/entanglement-is-not-that-magic/)
    and an [arxiv preprint](http://arxiv.org/abs/1208.6186) discussing this in more
    detail...) The impossibility of keeping track of all the ways entangled states
    get shifted is crucial to (the way I think about) the process of "decoherence"
    that plays a key role in [(the way I think about) the "Many-Worlds" interpretation
    of quantum physics](http://www.forbes.com/sites/chadorzel/2016/01/05/what-the-many-worlds-interpretation-of-quantum-physics-really-means/#71ae159531fc),

  zh: Ethan描述的“纠缠的破坏”实际上是一件稍微棘手的事情，需要进行相当特定的操作才能使其生效。有时候你会听到人们断言纠缠是脆弱的，*任何*一个粒子的扰动都会搞乱事情，但那并不是真的。事实上，你可以做很多事情来改变两个粒子之一的状态，而不破坏系统的纠缠特性，只要你跟踪你对它所做的事情，并相应地调整最终的测量结果。（我有一个[博客文章](http://scienceblogs.com/principles/2012/03/14/entanglement-is-not-that-magic/)和一个[arxiv预印本](http://arxiv.org/abs/1208.6186)，更详细地讨论了这个问题...）跟踪所有纠缠态变化方式的不可能性对（我对）“退相干”过程的理解至关重要，这在[(我对)量子物理中“多世界”解释的方式中](http://www.forbes.com/sites/chadorzel/2016/01/05/what-the-many-worlds-interpretation-of-quantum-physics-really-means/#71ae159531fc)扮演了关键角色，这也是我提到这些深层次东西的原因，尽管这篇文章已经写得很长，所以我不会在这里尝试解释。
- en: Crucially, though, this is not the sort of thing that people talk about doing
    when they talk about using entanglement for faster-than-light communication. What
    they want is a *measurement procedure that forces a particular outcome*. That
    is, they want Alice to use some woo-woo mystical process to ask her particle "What
    is your state?" and make it come out to be 1, thus instantaneously forcing Bob's
    particle into state 1 as well. If such a procedure existed, you could, in fact,
    exploit it to send messages (with disastrous consequences for causality); fortunately,
    [God plays dice with the universe](http://www.forbes.com/sites/chadorzel/2015/08/11/how-quantum-randomness-saves-relativity/),
    and the results of a quantum measurement are unavoidably random. Which means that
    while Alice and Bob end up with measurements that are perfectly correlated, no
    information passes between them. They can only see the correlation when they get
    back together and *compare* lists, and they have to do that at or below the speed
    of light.

  zh: 但至关重要的是，这不是人们讨论使用纠缠进行超光速通信时所说的事情。他们想要的是*强制一个特定结果的测量程序*。也就是说，他们希望Alice使用某种灵异的过程询问她的粒子：“你的状态是什么？”并使其最终变成1，从而瞬间强制Bob的粒子也进入状态1。如果存在这样的过程，你实际上可以利用它来发送消息（对因果性会造成灾难性后果）；幸运的是，[上帝和宇宙玩骰子](http://www.forbes.com/sites/chadorzel/2015/08/11/how-quantum-randomness-saves-relativity/)，量子测量结果是不可避免地随机的。这意味着虽然Alice和Bob最终得到的测量是完全相关的，但信息不会在他们之间传递。他们只能在彼此重新聚集并*比较*列表时看到这种相关性，而他们必须在或低于光速下进行这些操作。

- en: It should also be noted that the version of entanglement-based communication
    Ethan describes is a particularly naive sort that even fringe physicists mostly
    reject. A more plausible scheme for actually doing this would be to use different
    measurement bases to send information. That is, rather than "force the state to
    be 1 to send Bob a 1," Alice would ask two different questions of her particle.
    If she wants to send Bob a 1, she would make a measurement asking "Are you in
    0 or 1?," but if she wants to send a 0 she makes a measurement asking "Are you
    in '0+1' or '0-1'?" The latter operation puts Bob's particle into the corresponding
    state, which has a 50% chance of returning either 0 or 1 for his measurement.
    So all Bob has to do is measure that probability distribution for each particle--
    if it's either 0 or 1 with 100% probability, he knows Alice is sending a 1, and
    if it's 50% of each, she's sending a 0.
  id: totrans-split-22
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 还应该注意，Ethan描述的基于纠缠的通信方式是一种特别幼稚的方式，即使是边缘物理学家也大多不接受。更可信的方案实际上是使用不同的测量基础来发送信息。也就是说，Alice不会“强迫状态为1以发送给Bob一个1”，而是会向她的粒子提出两个不同的问题。如果她想发送给Bob一个1，她会进行一次测量，询问“你是0还是1？”，但如果她想发送一个0，她会进行另一种测量，询问“你是‘0+1’还是‘0-1’？”。后一种操作会将Bob的粒子置于相应的状态中，对于他的测量有50%的机会返回0或1。因此，Bob所要做的就是为每个粒子测量这个概率分布——如果它以100%的概率是0或1，他就知道Alice在发送一个1，如果是50%的概率，则是发送一个0。
- en: That scheme doesn't work either, for a more subtle reason. The problem is that
    you can't determine a probability distribution from a single measurement of "0"
    or "1," so Bob would need to make a lot of copies of the state of his particle
    in order to distinguish Alice's message. But there's a very deep result (that
    [Kaiser's book](http://www.hippiessavedphysics.com/) claims was directly inspired
    by these FTL communication schemes) known as the "no-cloning theorem" showing
    that this is impossible-- you can't make faithful copies of a quantum state unless
    you already know what it is. There's no way for Bob to unambiguously determine
    which measurement Alice made, so you're back in the scenario where Alice and Bob
    each have random strings of 1's and 0's that only turn out to be perfectly correlated
    later on, when they get back together and compare. [Quantum randomness saves the

  zh: 那个方案也不起作用，原因更微妙。问题在于，你无法从单次“0”或“1”的测量中确定概率分布，因此Bob需要复制他粒子的状态很多次才能区分Alice的消息。但有一个非常深刻的结果（[凯撒的书](http://www.hippiessavedphysics.com/)声称直接受到这些超光速通信方案启发），称为“无复制定理”，表明这是不可能的——你无法在不知道其内容的情况下制作一个量子态的忠实副本。Bob无法明确确定Alice进行了哪种测量，因此你回到了Alice和Bob各自拥有随机的1和0字符串的情景，只有当他们重新聚在一起并进行比较时才能发现它们完全相关。[量子随机性挽救了局面](http://www.forbes.com/sites/chadorzel/2015/08/11/how-quantum-randomness-saves-relativity/#2a506baf2ce2)。
