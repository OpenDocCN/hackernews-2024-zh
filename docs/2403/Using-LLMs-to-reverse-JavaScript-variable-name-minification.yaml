- en: This blog introduces a novel way to reverse minified Javascript using large
    language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT and llama2 while keeping the code semantically
    intact. The code is open source and available at [Github project Humanify](https://github.com/jehna/humanify).

    to optimize for fast network transfer. Looking from the reverse engineering standpoint,
    there are a few different categories of minification that present increasing challenges:'

- en: Most minification is lossless; There's no data lost when `true` is converted
    to its minified alternative `!0`. It's straightforward to [write a Babel transformation](https://github.com/jamiebuilds/babel-handbook/blob/master/translations/en/plugin-handbook.md)
    to reverse this process. There are [many](https://www.npmjs.com/package/babel-plugin-transform-beautifier)
    [tools](https://www.npmjs.com/package/debundle) that are specifically designed
    to reverse these kind of lossless transformations.

- en: Some data is lost during the minification, but that data may be trivial to recreate.
    A good example is whitespace; it's trivial to use [Prettier](https://prettier.io)
    (or a similar tool) to reformat minified code's indentation and whitespace to
    a human-readable format. Most of the time the developers have used similar tools
    with the original code too, so the whitespace data can be recreated with high
    confidence.

- en: The most important information that's lost during the minification process is
    the loss of variable and function names. When you run a minifier, it completely
    replaces all possible variable and function names to save bytes.

- en: Until now, there has not been any good way to reverse this process; when you
    rename a variable from `crossProduct` to `a`, there's not much you can do to reverse
    that process.

    good guess that the original name was something like `square`. But this requires
    the knowledge of the internal workings of the function.

- en: For a classical computer program it would be very difficult to make the leap
    from "multiply `b` with itself" to "squaring a number". Fortunately recent advances
    in LLMs have made this leap not only possible, but almost trivial.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Essentially the step 2\. is called "rephrasing" (or "translating" if you consider
    Javascript as its own natural language), and LLMs are known to be very good at
    that.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Another task where LLMs really shine is summarization, which is pretty much
    what we're doing in step 3\. The only specialization here is that the output needs
    to be short enough and formatted to the camel case.

- en: The issue with using output from LLMs is that they are not deterministic. In
    a nutshell a LLM is a very complex markov chain; it tries its best to guess the
    next word in a text based on the previous words.

- en: This used to be a problem, but fortunately there are now ways to control the
    LLM's output like [guidance](https://guidance.readthedocs.io/) and [outlines](https://github.com/normal-computing/outlines).
    These tools use different techniques to ensure that the LLM's output matches a
    desired format.
  prefs: []

    the output with a regular expression to ensure that the output is a valid Javascript
    variable name.

- en: Now while LLMs are very good at rephrasing and summarizing, they are not very
    good at coding (yet). They have inherent randomness, which makes them unsuitable
    for performing the actual renaming and modification of the code.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Fortunately renaming a Javascript variable within its scope is a solved problem
    with traditional tools like Babel. Babel first parses the code into an abstract
    syntax tree (AST, a machine representation of the code), which is easy to modify
    using well behaving algorithms.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This is much better than letting the LLM modify the code on a text level; it
    ensures that only very specific transformations are carried out so the code's
    functionality does not change after the renaming. The code is guaranteed to have
    the original functionality and to be runnable by the computer.
