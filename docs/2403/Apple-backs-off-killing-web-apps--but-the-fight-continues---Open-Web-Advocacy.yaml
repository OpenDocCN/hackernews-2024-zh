    backlash, Apple has [cancelled its plan to sabotage Web Apps](https://9to5mac.com/2024/03/01/apple-home-screen-web-apps-ios-17-eu/)!.

    is no doubt related to the [investigation they had opened](https://www.ft.com/content/d2f7328c-5851-4f16-8f8d-93f0098b6adc).
    But our most heartfelt thanks are to the thousands of developers who took the
    time to fill in our survey and sign the open letter, to show Apple that developers
    and businesses can't be used as pawns. We are grateful for your help and no doubt
    will need it again - know that your voices were heard in Brussels and Cupertino,
    and have made a difference.

    to Apple's plan to sabotage Web Apps for the EU. Apple’s over a decade suppression
    of the web in favour of the AppStore continues worldwide, and their attempt to
    destroy web apps in the EU is just their latest attempt. If there is to be any
    silver lining, it is that this has thoroughly exposed Apple’s genuine fear of
    a secure, open and interoperable alternative to their proprietary App Store that
    they can not control or tax.

    access to the App Store and by taking a commission for payments made via Apple
    IAP. Apple therefore benefits from higher usage of native apps on iOS. By requiring
    all browsers on iOS to use the WebKit browser engine, **Apple is able to exert
    control over the maximum functionality of all browsers on iOS** and, as a consequence,
    hold up the development and use of web apps. This limits the **competitive constraint
    that web apps pose on native apps**, which in turn protects and benefits Apple’s
    App Store revenues. [UK CMA - Interim Report into Mobile Ecosystems](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/mobile-ecosystems-market-study-interim-report)
