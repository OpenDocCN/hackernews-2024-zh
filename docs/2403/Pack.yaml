- en: Pack is a container format that can support files and raw data, and it is made
    to be safe, fast, and reliable for years to come.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It is designed to be the most efficient way to pack any amount of data and improve
    the user experience to fit the future. The author proposes a fresh solution based
    on well-formed standards to significantly improve performance while improving
    features like random access, update, security, and user experience.

- en: It's been decades since any new proper work was done for a container format,
    and the author felt that there was a need for a new design considering new generations
    of hardware and advancements in algorithms.

- en: Most popular solutions like Zip, gzip, tar, RAR, or 7-Zip are near or more than
    three decades old. While holding value for such a long time (in the computer world)
    is testimony to their greatness, the work is far from done.

    with.

- en: Beside numbers, the Pack format is based on the universal and arguably one of
    the most safe and stable file formats, SQLite3, and compression is based on Zstandard,
    the leading standard algorithm in the field. These design choices promise reliable
    storage, transactional updates, exceptional speed, low resource usage, smartness,
    and simplicity.

    encryption, graphical interface, OS integration, and development tools and libraries
    are planned and under development. Builds for many more platforms will be available
    over time.

- en: The field of data compression has been well-lit with great work in the past
    decades, and Pack tries to continue this path as the next step and proposes the
    next universal choice in the field.
