    an American pianist and xylophonist nicknamed "the one-man piano duet". It gained
    worldwide popularity through [Dick Dale](/wiki/Dick_Dale "Dick Dale")'s 1962 [American](/wiki/Music_of_the_United_States
    "Music of the United States") [surf rock](/wiki/Surf_music "Surf music") version,
    originally titled "**Miserlou**", which popularized the song in [Western](/wiki/Western_world
    "Western world") [popular culture](/wiki/Popular_culture "Popular culture"); Dale's
    version was influenced by an earlier Arabic folk version played with an [oud](/wiki/Oud

    including other surf and [rock](/wiki/Rock_music "Rock music") versions by bands
    such as [the Beach Boys](/wiki/The_Beach_Boys "The Beach Boys"), [the Ventures](/wiki/The_Ventures

    of Misirlis (Μισιρλής- a surname) which comes from the Turkish word Mısırlı, which
    is formed by combining Mısır ("Egypt" in Turkish, borrowed from Arabic مِصر‎ Miṣr)
    with the [Turkish -lı suffix](/wiki/Turkish_vocabulary#Adjectives_from_nouns "Turkish
    vocabulary"), literally meaning "Egyptian". Therefore, the song is about an Egyptian
    woman. The original Turkish word *Mısırlı* is, however, [genderless](/wiki/Genderless_language

    a folk song before he moved to the United States. As with almost all early rebetika
    songs (a style that originated with the Greek refugees from Asia Minor in [Turkey](/wiki/Turkey
    "Turkey")), the song''s actual [composer](/wiki/Composer "Composer") has never
    been identified, and its ownership rested with the band leader. Demetriades named
    the song "Misirlou" in his original 1927 [Columbia](/wiki/Columbia_Records "Columbia
    Records") recording, which is a Greek assimilated borrowing of the regional pronunciation
    of "Egyptian" in Turkish ("Mısırlı"), as opposed to the corresponding word for
    "Egyptian" (female) in Greek, which is Αιγύπτια (*Aigyptia*).'

    to be a folk song from their own country. In the realm of [Middle Eastern music](/wiki/Middle_Eastern_music
