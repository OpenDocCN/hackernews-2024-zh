- en: The Acoustic Revive Disc Demagnetizer RD-3 is Acoustic Revive's most well-known
    development. The RD-3 improves the sound of every disc you play at the push of
    a button. Place your disc on the spindle of the Acoustic Revive RD-3, push the
    button, and wait until the light goes off. Flip the disk, repeat the process and
    prepare yourself for a huge surprise! The RD-3 removes residual magnetism from
    any disc - the RD-3 does not spin, as spinning the disc creates even more of a
    static charge. What you get is a better tonality, a wider, taller and deeper soundstage
    and more air between instruments.

- en: Firstly, it is thought that ferrous ingredients contained in the printing ink
    of the label side of the disc is one of the causes of magnetizing discs. For example,
    iron oxide is used for red, yellow or brown ink, cobalt is used for blue or green
    ink and nickel is used for silver ink. These materials, iron, cobalt, nickel,
    are called ferromagnetic substances, and they are relatively easy to magnetize.

- en: Second, problems are caused by the use of aluminum used for the recording side
    of CD. Currently, the JIS (Japanese Industrial Standard) states that the purity
    of the aluminum used must be 99.0%. The other 1% contains ferromagnetic substance
    such as iron, nickel and cobalt. Aluminum is a weak magnetic material, so it is
    easily influenced by magnetism.

- en: CD players contain magnetic substances, when a disc is played, the rotation
    of the mechanism, magnet and motor generates a flux which quickly causes discs
    to become magnetized.

- en: The multi-purpose audio demagnetizer RD-3 is a ground breaking appliance which
    can easily treat and completely demagnetize all kind of optical discs (CD, DVD,
    etc). If you demagnetize your disc by RD-3, sound and picture quality are much
    improved and you will be able to hear aspects of the recording that were inaudible
    from magnetized discs.

- en: RD-3 also has a remarkable effect on digital recording media such as CD-R, DVD-R.
    If a disc is demagnetized by RD-3 before recording, the sound quality improves
    greatly regardless of the recording device or software.
