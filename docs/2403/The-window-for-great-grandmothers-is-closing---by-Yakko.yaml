    grandmother ([this grandmother](https://memoirsandrambles.substack.com/p/there-are-many-ways-to-say-i-love))
    became *a* grandma (not *my* grandma) at 45.

  zh: 今天我和一个朋友在谈论我们的家庭时，我意识到我的祖母（[这位祖母](https://memoirsandrambles.substack.com/p/there-are-many-ways-to-say-i-love)）45岁时就成了*一个*奶奶（不是*我的*奶奶）。
- en: She had my aunt when she was reasonably young and my aunt in turn had her first
    child at a young age as well.
  id: totrans-split-7
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 她在相当年轻时就有了我的姑妈，然后我的姑妈也很年轻时生了她的第一个孩子。
- en: She then went on to become a great-grandmother at 75, meaning my cousin already
    broke the trend a bit, having his first kid at 30.
  id: totrans-split-8
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 她当时75岁成为了曾祖母，这意味着我表弟已经有所不同，他30岁时有了第一个孩子。
- en: Thus, even though I never met my great-grandparents, my cousin’s children have,
    and they should consider themselves quite lucky.
  id: totrans-split-9

  zh: 因此，即使我从未见过我的曾祖父母，我的表弟的孩子们却见过，并且他们应该认为自己非常幸运。
- en: Because the age of great-grandparents is ending, and it didn’t last very long
    either.
  id: totrans-split-10
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 因为曾祖父母的时代已经结束，而且也没有持续很长时间。
- en: It’s slightly paradoxical — in the past, I’ve thought about how since life expectancy
    is increasing, there probably will be more great-grandmothers. But on the other
    hand, people are having children much later too.
  id: totrans-split-11
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 这有点矛盾 —— 过去，我曾想过随着预期寿命的增加，可能会有更多的曾祖母。但另一方面，人们也在晚生孩子。
- en: For instance, with the way things are going (i.e. me not being close to having
    kids), my parents will likely become grandparents when they’re nearing 70, a couple
    decades later than my grandmother.
  id: totrans-split-12
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 举例来说，以目前的情况来看（即我还没有孩子），我父母可能在接近70岁时成为祖父母，比我祖母晚了几十年。
- en: In Brazil, where I’m from, this shift is quite recent. Until just one or two
    generations ago people were having multiple kids, and at very young ages. Now,
    I don’t have a single friend in my mid-to-late twenties friend group who has already
    had a kid.

  zh: 在我来自的巴西，这种变化是相当最近的。仅仅一两代人之前，人们还在很年轻的时候生多个孩子。现在，我在二三十岁朋友圈里一个朋友都还没有孩子。
- en: So while the older generations are living longer and giving themselves a better
    shot at having great-grandkids, their descendants’ habits aren’t really helping.
  id: totrans-split-14

  zh: 所以虽然老一辈的人活得更久，给自己更多机会有曾孙辈，但他们后代的习惯并没有真正有所帮助。
- en: But even more interesting is that this “age of great-grandmothers” as I like
    to call it not only is ending, but it hasn’t been here for long either.

  zh: 但更有趣的是，正如我所称呼的“曾祖母的时代”，不仅即将结束，而且也没有持续很长时间。
- en: How old did people live to be in the 1900s? What about the 1500s? And the 800s?
    Given all the advances we’ve had in medicine and other areas of society, more
    people can reach old age now than ever before.

  zh: 19世纪的人们平均活多久？1500年代呢？800年代呢？鉴于我们在医药和社会其他领域的所有进步，比以往任何时候都有更多的人能够活到老年。
- en: And what that means is, while people had children *even earlier*, there likely
    weren’t as many people who got old enough to have grandkids even in that case.
  id: totrans-split-17
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 这意味着，尽管人们以前更早地生孩子，即使在那种情况下，也可能没有那么多人活到足够年纪有孙子辈。
- en: So all in all, out of all the time humans have been on Earth, it is possible
    that the window in history (be it a few or several hundred years) during which
    there were probably the most great-grandparents is kind of around now, and it’s
    seemingly about to end.

  zh: 总而言之，在人类存在的所有时间中，有可能这个历史窗口（无论是几年还是几百年）里曾经最多的曾祖父母大概就是现在这个时代，而这个时代似乎即将结束。
