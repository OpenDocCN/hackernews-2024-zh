- en: A friend and I were talking about our families today when I realized that my
    grandmother ([this grandmother](https://memoirsandrambles.substack.com/p/there-are-many-ways-to-say-i-love))
    became *a* grandma (not *my* grandma) at 45.

    child at a young age as well.

    broke the trend a bit, having his first kid at 30.

    and they should consider themselves quite lucky.

    either.

    is increasing, there probably will be more great-grandmothers. But on the other
    hand, people are having children much later too.

- en: For instance, with the way things are going (i.e. me not being close to having
    kids), my parents will likely become grandparents when they’re nearing 70, a couple
    decades later than my grandmother.

- en: In Brazil, where I’m from, this shift is quite recent. Until just one or two
    generations ago people were having multiple kids, and at very young ages. Now,
    I don’t have a single friend in my mid-to-late twenties friend group who has already
    had a kid.

    shot at having great-grandkids, their descendants’ habits aren’t really helping.

    to call it not only is ending, but it hasn’t been here for long either.

    Given all the advances we’ve had in medicine and other areas of society, more
    people can reach old age now than ever before.

    weren’t as many people who got old enough to have grandkids even in that case.

    that the window in history (be it a few or several hundred years) during which
    there were probably the most great-grandparents is kind of around now, and it’s
    seemingly about to end.
