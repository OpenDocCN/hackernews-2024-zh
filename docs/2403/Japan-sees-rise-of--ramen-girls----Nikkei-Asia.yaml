- en: TOKYO -- Ramen, Japan's ubiquitous noodle soup, has become one of the country's
    most internationally recognized dishes. In Japan, though, ramen is a dish with
    largely masculine connotations -- traditionally it is men who get misty-eyed about
    their favorite ramen restaurants, not women. Now that is changing as a new culture
    of "girl ramen" takes hold.

- en: Since the 1960s, when ramen served as a cog in the engine of Japan's period
    of rapid economic growth, ramen has been a largely male prerogative, a source
    of private joy and the entrance to a man's inner sanctum. Most men enter ramen
    establishments alone, sit at the counter and talk to no one. Socializing or soaking
    up the ambience is never the point.
