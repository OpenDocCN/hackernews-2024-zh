    the disease’s discovery and the epidemic of postconcussion symptoms among football
    players helped usher in a drastic change in the way we treat concussions generally.
    Instead of hustling people back out onto the field, doctors began pushing rest.

    to the field just three days, on average, after [getting a concussion](https://bjsm.bmj.com/content/54/2/102),
    according to an analysis published in the British Journal of Sports Medicine.

    tasks and produced less of a protein [important for brain healing](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3335105/)
    when they were forced to run on a wheel vs. when they were allowed to do whatever

    you might get hit again before you’ve recovered, or to work, which might be cognitively
    straining. But instead of nuanced advice that *included* downtime or a scaling
    back of activities, the recommendation became total rest. In 2009 the [third Consensus

    physical and cognitive rest until symptoms resolve” as the first line of treatment

    mild traumatic brain injuries, with more severe conditions, like penetrating head
    injuries or brain hemorrhages. In those cases, many patients benefit from a very
    quiet environment. “We were trying to apply concepts globally, and it may not

    a professor of neurochemistry at the University of Gothenburg in Sweden. But it
    turns out that to heal from a concussion, your brain doesn’t actually *need* to
    stitch together those damaged connections. When a major highway needs roadwork,
    commuters don’t just wait around until it’s complete. Instead, traffic gets diverted.
    That’s what happens after a concussion, Zetterberg said. When brain cells stretch
    and fray, signals get sent down other neural pathways. At first, this is incredibly
    taxing. You might feel exhausted, have pounding headaches, and be emotionally
    frazzled. You might struggle to complete tasks that once felt easy, like reading
    or doing basic math. Then, eventually, you might start to feel better. “That is
    not because the brain has healed,” Zetterberg said. “It is because the brain circuits
    that are not injured, they recalibrate themselves.” The brain finds new highways
    to send signals down.

    clearance before returning to play rolled out; this sent a wave of concussion
    patients to children’s hospitals, motivating pediatricians to figure out how to
    help them beyond just “Rest until you feel better.” Researchers are developing
    tools to help identify concussions—allowing doctors to get a firm diagnosis—and
    track the brain’s healing process. Advocates like the Gormallys are making sure
    patients get that actionable information they couldn’t find before.

- en: As long as people play sports and go to work, drive cars and stumble down stairs,
    we’ll keep injuring our brains, as we do other parts of our bodies as we move
    through the world. But maybe, in the near future, when another average pickup
    soccer player hits his head, the doctor will tell him that his brain isn’t bruised—it
    just needs a little rewiring. And the soccer player will walk out knowing exactly
    what to do.
