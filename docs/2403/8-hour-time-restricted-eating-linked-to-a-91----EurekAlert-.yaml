- en: CHICAGO, March 18, 2024 — An analysis of over 20,000 U.S. adults found that
    people who limited their eating across less than 8 hours per day, a time-restricted
    eating plan, were more likely to die from cardiovascular disease compared to people
    who ate across 12-16 hours per day, according to preliminary research presented
    at the American Heart Association’s [Epidemiology and Prevention│Lifestyle and
    Cardiometabolic Scientific Sessions 2024](https://professional.heart.org/en/meetings/epi-lifestyle),
    March 18- 21, in Chicago. The meeting offers the latest science on population-based
    health and wellness and implications for lifestyle.

- en: Time-restricted eating, a type of intermittent fasting, involves limiting the
    hours for eating to a specific number of hours each day, which may range from
    a 4- to 12-hour time window in 24 hours. Many people who follow a time-restricted
    eating diet follow a 16:8 eating schedule, where they eat all their foods in an
    8-hour window and fast for the remaining 16 hours each day, the researchers noted.
    Previous research has found that time-restricted eating improves several cardiometabolic
    health measures, such as blood pressure, blood glucose and cholesterol levels.

    gained popularity in recent years as a way to lose weight and improve heart health,”
    said senior study author Victor Wenze Zhong, Ph.D., a professor and chair of the
    department of epidemiology and biostatistics at the Shanghai Jiao Tong University
    School of Medicine in Shanghai, China. “However, the long-term health effects
    of time-restricted eating, including risk of death from any cause or cardiovascular
    disease, are unknown.”

    of following an 8-hour time-restricted eating plan. They reviewed information
    about dietary patterns for participants in the annual 2003-2018 National Health
    and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES) in comparison to data about people
    who died in the U.S., from 2003 through December 2019, from the Centers for Disease
    Control and Prevention’s National Death Index database.

    eating schedule were more likely to die from cardiovascular disease. Even though
    this type of diet has been popular due to its potential short-term benefits, our
    research clearly shows that, compared with a typical eating time range of 12-16
    hours per day, a shorter eating duration was not associated with living longer,”
    Zhong said.

    or cancer, to be aware of the association between an 8-hour eating window and
    increased risk of cardiovascular death. Our study’s findings encourage a more
    cautious, personalized approach to dietary recommendations, ensuring that they
    are aligned with an individual’s health status and the latest scientific evidence,”
    he continued. “Although the study identified an association between an 8-hour
    eating window and cardiovascular death, this does not mean that time-restricted
    eating caused cardiovascular death.”

    the different subsets of participants. Without this information, it cannot be
    determined if nutrient density might be an alternate explanation to the findings
    that currently focus on the window of time for eating. Second, it needs to be
    emphasized that categorization into the different windows of time-restricted eating
    was determined on the basis of just two days of dietary intake,” he said.

    across the groups that were classified into the different time-restricted eating
    windows – for example, was the group with the shortest time-restricted eating
    window unique compared to people who followed other eating schedules,  in terms
    of weight, stress, traditional cardiometabolic risk factors or other factors associated
    with adverse cardiovascular outcomes? This additional information will help to
    better understand the potential independent contribution of the short time-restricted
    eating pattern reported in this interesting and provocative abstract.”
