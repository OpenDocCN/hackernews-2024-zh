- en: I had always done "innovative" things. When I was bored at my first professional
    job, I built (without being asked) a series of scripts to do UNIX-style log file
    analysis to help me help my customers succeed better. In the first of many poorly
    chosen product naming decisions, I called this set of scripts "Pipeline" (the
    scripts that sat out in the field on customers' devices) and "Refinery" (the scripts
    that ran in the office that analyzed the log files being sent in from the field).
    I have no idea why I was enamored with crude oil processing, but there you have
    it. Within weeks of launching this for myself, everyone in my team was clamoring
    for this to be deployed on their customers' equipment. Eventually, this product
    became the launching nucleus of a new consulting group within the company. A consulting
    group, I might add, that I was never asked to join, run, or advise. For my efforts,
    I received no recognition and zero bonus dollars in compensation. I was not then,
    nor now, bitter over this, but it made me realize that some organizations do not
    appreciate the efforts made to improve the state of the business.

    needed to go to two different websites to order some things for our new house
    that we were closing on the next month. One site was [FedEx](https://www.fedex.com/?ref=sanjayparekh.com)
    and the other was [IKEA](https://www.ikea.com/?ref=sanjayparekh.com). Both of
    these sites had a landing page asking you what country you were in before taking
    you to the relevant content you came for. Now realize this was before high speed,
    always on Internet connections. So, taking an extra step with the downloading
    of associated graphics on a dial-up connection was a painful waste of my time.
    After all, when we go to the store, we don't enter and declare the language we
    will converse in or the currency we intend to use - why should our experience
    be any different on the Internet?

    [whois](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3912?ref=sanjayparekh.com), etc.,

    onto a geographic map of the world.

    Not because of any legal issues, instead we had started chatting because he would
    come by daily to my cubicle to buy [Atomic Fireballs](https://amzn.to/3VeTbOe?ref=sanjayparekh.com).
    I had orchestrated the purchasing of a foosball table (a [Tornado](https://tornadofoosball.com/?ref=sanjayparekh.com)
    Cyclone II, in case you're wondering) for the company and then decided I needed
    to open up a candy shop in my cube because the vending machines were ridiculously
    priced and I needed funds to maintain the foosball table. (As an aside, even though
    many ridiculed the foosball table at first, the company later purchased a ping
    pong table and a pool table to complete an employee game room. Further proof this
    company was not my forever home.) The lawyer and I had been batting around ideas
    for months, given the dot-com boom of the late 1990s and our desire to get in
    on the action.

    else had already done it. He asked his brother and his brother's friends - folks
    who were involved in Silicon Valley startups - and they all responded that this
    was technically possible, no one was doing it, and providing this would be valuable.

    my first task became writing a patent application in excruciating detail instead
    of writing code. For an engineer, this is a painful exercise. Only years later
    did I come to appreciate this early effort to protect the intellectual property
    around my idea, which has led to ten patents in my name and given me the ability
    to write and secure additional patents around other inventions I've devised.

    came to me months before the idea. I was at home one evening working on the computer
    with the news on in the background. In the story, they spoke about a special envoy
    being sent to some country. I instantly thought to myself, "Digital Envoy would
    be a great name for something one day." So the name stuck in my head (I tried
    to use it once for another idea I had at the company I was working at - that idea
    didn't go anywhere) until there was a chance to use it. I do sometimes wish I
    still had access to my email address from those days but it has been long enough
    now that it doesn't really matter.

    mate who sat across from me, and myself. My cubicle mate was involved from the
    start on more of the marketing side, but the whole endeavor was concerning to
    his significant other so he soon dropped off (we compensated him for the stock
    we repurchased back). Looking back, this is one of my regrets. I'm still friends
    with him (we just traded emails a few days ago), but I really wish he had been
    along for the ride. I think the outcome would have been very different and likely
    much better if that had happened. He has moved on but sadly is no longer in Atlanta
    and I haven't seen him, in person, in decades.

    and negative with venture capital (this will be a longer post for another day).
    Having investors who had no practical experience telling us how we should run
    the business. The drumbeat of monthly (yes, monthly) board meetings. If I've learned
    anything, it is that having monthly board meetings, even for a fast-moving startup,
    is like watching grass grow. It isn't fun for anyone and only leads to disillusionment.

- en: Contrary to popular belief now, the original idea I had was not about restricting
    access to content (which it is widely used for now by streaming providers) or
    targeting advertising to people based on their location (which, if you've ever
    used the web, you know that this is done extensively), but instead making content
    more accessible to people. It is easy to answer the question about your location
    when it is presented to you in a language you understand. But what if you land
    on that FedEx or IKEA page and don't understand the question being asked? That
    is a roadblock that could exist in the real world (especially when you travel),
    but why would we allow that roadblock to exist online?

    of uses across the web. I don't think we really understood how true that would
    be. When I left my operating role at the company, our technology was being used
    for everything from ad serving to content control. Some customers were using it
    to control access to encryption or even accessing gambling ([the client](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caliente_Hip%C3%B3dromo?ref=sanjayparekh.com)
    was my fastest deal ever, closing in three days from first contact!). This diversity
    in clientele was something that allowed us almost never to have an issue with
    revenue growth. If one sector that we served was lagging, another was leading.

    was not a recognized "thing" but because our business was built around a dataset
    that needed to be constantly monitored, updated, and managed, it made sense for
    us to charge our customers based on a monthly recurring revenue model. We also
    decided to price finer levels of granularity at a higher price. Access to country-level
    data would be cheaper than state or city-level data. In truth, there was no added
    "cost" to determine city-level versus country-level data - it all had to be done
    at the same time. However, the value proposition for the client was different
    and provided a more accessible entry point for those just starting at the country
    level to start using IP geolocation. This was one of the true (lucky) insights
    that unlocked our business and revenue growth for us. Given a low churn rate (we
    had over 95% of customers re-sign contracts annually), a recurring revenue business
    is nearly impossible to mess up.

    arise about a year after we started. The problem was they were a Silicon Valley
    based startup where the founders had already started and sold companies previously.
    Our team had never started a company before, let alone sold one. We had never
    raised capital for a startup. We had never launched a product ourselves as a group
    or individually. On paper, we were not the horse you would bet on. In fact, in
    launching the company, we raised $1.5m in funding at the end of 1999 and the beginning
    of 2000\. When our chief competitor launched in 2000, they started with $10m in
    funding.

    large exit. We took the meeting, and during a weekend (so that our employees wouldn't
    know we were having this conversation), their founding CTO came and talked to
    us about how they were positioned. He told us they were about to raise a $50m
    funding round on a $250m valuation. They had already closed that $10m round, so
    any way you cut it, their funding dwarfed ours. The CTO then followed up on his
    funding pronouncement with the comment, "So you all can either join us or we'll
    crush you." As you can imagine, that put a damper on the discussion and the meeting
    wrapped up soon after.

    us" was infuriating. We decided to go it alone, and the results show this was
    the right decision. In the end, both companies were acquired. Digital Envoy was
    acquired for more than our total lifetime funding (we went on to raise a $10.5m
    venture funding round, giving us a total lifetime raise of $12m), while our competitor
    sold for less than the money they raised. They never did raise that $50m round,
    although their lifetime funding came in at $58.8m.
