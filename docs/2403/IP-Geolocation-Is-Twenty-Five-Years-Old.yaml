    job, I built (without being asked) a series of scripts to do UNIX-style log file
    analysis to help me help my customers succeed better. In the first of many poorly
    chosen product naming decisions, I called this set of scripts "Pipeline" (the
    scripts that sat out in the field on customers' devices) and "Refinery" (the scripts
    that ran in the office that analyzed the log files being sent in from the field).
    I have no idea why I was enamored with crude oil processing, but there you have
    it. Within weeks of launching this for myself, everyone in my team was clamoring
    for this to be deployed on their customers' equipment. Eventually, this product
    became the launching nucleus of a new consulting group within the company. A consulting
    group, I might add, that I was never asked to join, run, or advise. For my efforts,
    I received no recognition and zero bonus dollars in compensation. I was not then,

    "cost" to determine city-level versus country-level data - it all had to be done
    at the same time. However, the value proposition for the client was different
    and provided a more accessible entry point for those just starting at the country
    level to start using IP geolocation. This was one of the true (lucky) insights

    - 所有这些都需要同时完成。然而，对客户的价值主张却是不同的，并且为刚开始使用IP地理定位的从国家级开始的人提供了更容易接入的入口点。这是解锁我们业务和收入增长的真正（幸运的）洞察之一。鉴于低流失率（我们超过95%的客户每年都会重新签订合同），循环收入业务几乎不可能出错。
