- en: When last we checked in with Hewlett Packard (HP), the company [had just been
    sued](https://www.techdirt.com/2024/01/11/hp-hit-with-yet-another-lawsuit-over-bricking-printers-that-use-third-party-ink-cartridges/) (for
    the second time) for crippling customer printers if owners attempt to use cheaper,
    third-party printer cartridges. It was just the latest in a long saga where printer
    manufacturers use DRM or dodgy software updates to wage all out war on consumer
    choice.

    Shortly after the lawsuit HP CEO Enrique Lores [went on CNBC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPRMyQSZGuY) to
    double down on the company’s position. First by making up claims that HP **has**
    to be obnoxious about cartridges to protect consumer security (false), then by
    basically stating that any consumer who intelligently shops for cartridges is
    a “bad investment.”

    The company’s new “[All-In Plan](https://www.hp.com/us-en/all-in-plan/printers.html)”
    requires that you pay anywhere from $7 a month to $36 a month to rent a printer
    with a set printable page limit. During your rental, HP sends you, of course,
    their ink cartridges.'

    fees should you not subscribe for the full two-year term. All told, the tone-deafness
    is fairly stunning.

- en: Paying for the same several-hundred dollar printer for all eternity is precisely
    the sort of concept Lores has been pushing for a while. The problem is it’s not
    clear that anybody *actually wants this*. It’s also not really clear that paying
    up to $36 for a printer you never really own makes much value sense. Printers
    inherently aren’t that expensive. And ink isn’t either, if companies aren’t being
    restrictive tyrants.

    or building solid relationships. He’s thinking exclusively of finding creative
    ways to goose profits and deliver Wall Street improved quarterly returns **at
    any cost**. You can’t do that by simply providing users a quality, affordable
    product people like; you inevitably have to start cutting corners and nickel-and-diming
    users.

    jack the rental price skyward as they make the underlying value proposition steadily
    worse. Ultimately the business becomes less and less about making popular quality
    products, and more and more about making unnecessarily convoluted subscriptions
    with creative restrictions and ever-skyrocketing monthly prices.
