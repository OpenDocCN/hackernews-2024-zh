    related to the U.S. elections, as announced by the tech giant on Tuesday. This
    decision, initially trialed during India’s elections, has now been extended globally,
    aiming to mitigate the spread of misinformation and abuse surrounding political
    events. The company, emphasizing its commitment to user safety and the democratic
    process, justified the move by stating it as a precautionary measure in light
    of the upcoming 2024 election season.

    election date but remains vigilant against potential abuse, including the dissemination
    of misleading content or impersonation. Similarly, Anthropic’s Claude AI has been
    declared off-limits to political candidates, with strict policies in place to
    detect and deter misuse, including misinformation campaigns and impersonation
    attempts.
