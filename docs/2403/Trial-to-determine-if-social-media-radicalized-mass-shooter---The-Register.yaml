    a US court their platforms did not contribute to the radicalization of a mass
    shooter who killed ten people and injured three more in a New York grocery store
    in 2022.

    Feroleto denied a dismissal request from Meta, Reddit, Twitch's company Amazon,

    plaintiffs' contention that they were liable for Payton Gendron's shooting at
    a Tops Friendly Markets store in Buffalo, New York, in a predominantly Black neighborhood
    of the city.

    to life in prison and is awaiting a [federal death penalty trial](https://apnews.com/article/buffalo-supermarket-shooting-death-penalty-b6ab8eda541c2c0a0b512a89b0471b91)
    – was radicalized by the content he discovered on the defendants' platforms.

    he became addicted to social media apps and was lured, unsuspectingly, into a
    psychological vortex by defective social media applications designed, marketed,

    protected by the First Amendment right to freedom of speech and the Communications
    Decency Act (CDA) – specifically [Section 230](https://www.theregister.com/Tag/Section%20230/),
    which protects platforms from liability for the content posted by their users.

    and First Amendment protects the platforms. However, as the judge notes, that's
    not the argument they're making.

    and harmfully designed ''products'' that drove Gendron to specific materials and
    that they are therefore liable," Feroleto wrote. If viewed as products and not
    platforms, Section 230 is irrelevant, the plaintiffs argue.'

    harm incurred by any person injured as a result of their products – even if they
    weren't using the product themselves, the judge said.

    plaintiffs'' allegations concerning product liability establish a basis for ''duty''
    to these plaintiffs," Feroleto found. As such, the case can proceed.'

    that way unless the platforms successfully appeal or settle the matter. The result
    could set a precedent that makes it harder to use Section 230 as a get-out-of-jail-free
    card for social media platforms – something that US officials have [long tried
    to do](https://www.theregister.com/2022/09/09/biden_tech_reform_Section230/).
