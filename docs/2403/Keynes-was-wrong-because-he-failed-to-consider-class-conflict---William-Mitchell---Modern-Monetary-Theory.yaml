- en: I was asked during an interview the other day from Paris whether I was a Post
    Keynesian. I replied not at all and explained that I have never felt that my ideas
    fit into that category although in a facile sense we are all post keynesian in
    a temporal sense. Most progressive economists would answer yes if confronted with
    that question, even most of the economists involved in advancing Modern Monetary
    Theory (MMT). My point of departure is that while there was a lot of important
    analytical material in Keynes’ writing that is worth preserving and integrating
    into, say, MMT, where Keynes went astray was his antipathy to the insights provided
    by Karl Marx. In particular, I consider that Keynes seriously misunderstood what
    the dynamics of the class conflict were within a capitalist mode of production.
    Keynes made major errors in his predictions that one can directly attribute to
    this blinkered approach to capitalism. I was reminded of this when I read an Op
    Ed in the Japan Times this week (March 10, 2024) – [The economic future of our
    overworked grandchildren](https://www.japantimes.co.jp/commentary/2024/03/10/world/keynes-grandchildren-prediction-wrong/).
    This blinkered approach, which has fed into the modern Post Keynesian literature
    – which examines capitalism as if it is an ahistorical, neutral system of production
    and distribution – is a major reason that I do not associate my work with that
    school of thought.
