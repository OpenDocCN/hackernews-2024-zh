    protons, and neutron (which themselves are composed of [elementary particles](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elementary_particle)).
    The most interesting part of the atom for computers and electronics are the [electrons](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron)
    because electron are mobile (i.e. it can move around relatively easily, unlike
    protons and neutrons which are more difficult to move) and they can free-float
    by itself without being held inside an atom.'

- en: Usually, each atoms has equal number of protons and electrons, we call this
    "neutral" state. As it happens, it is possible for an atom to lose or gain extra
    electrons. Atoms in this unbalanced state are said to be "positively charged"
    atom (more proton than electrons) and "negatively charged" atom (more electron
    than proton) respectively.

- en: Electrons are unconstructible and indestructible (not so in quantum mechanics,
    but that's irrelevant for our purpose); so if an atom loses an electron, some
    other atom nearby had to receive the extra electrons or the electron had to released
    into a free floating electron, conversely since electron is unconstructible, to
    gain extra electron, an atom had to sap it off nearby atoms or from a free floating
    electron. The mechanics of electrons is such that if there is a negatively-charged
    atom near a positively-charged atom, then some electrons will migrate until both
    atoms have the same charge.

    from an area with very high number of negatively-charged atoms to an area with
    very high number of positively-charged atoms. Certain chemical reactions can create
    a situation where we have one nodes with lots of negatively-charged atoms (called
    "anode"), and another node with lots of positively-charged atoms (called "cathode").
    If we connect two oppositely charged nodes with a wire, masses of electrons will
    flow from the anode to cathode, and this flow is what we call "electric current".'

    in "conducting" materials than in "resistant" materials. A "conducting" material
    have low electrical resistance (e.g. copper wires in cables) and a "resistant"
    material have high electrical resistance (e.g. rubber cable insulation). Some
    interesting materials are called semi-conductors (e.g. silicons), because they
    can alter their resistance easily, under certain conditions a semiconductor might
    act as a conductor and at other conditions it might turn into a resistor.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Electricity always prefers to flow through the material with least resistance,
    so if a cathode and anode are connected with two wires, one having very high resistance
    and the other with very low resistance, the majority of electrons will flow through
    the low resistance cable and nearly none flows through the high resistance material.

    between two pieces of wire to cut off and/or restore electricity flow. Transistors
    works exactly the same as a light switch, except that instead of physically connecting
    and disconnecting wires, a transistor connects/disconnects electricity flow by
    altering its resistance depending on whether there is electricity in the base
    node, and, as you might have already guessed/know, transistors are made from semiconductors
    because we can alter semiconductor to become either a resistor or a conductor
    to connect or disconnect electric currents.

    capacitor is like a rechargeable battery, if a capacitor is charged it will retain
    extra electrons and it can also return electrons to the circuitry.

    all the electrons in the capacitor until it's empty (write 0). To read the value
    of a capacitor, we try to discharge it. If, when we try to discharge, there is
    no electricity flowing, then the capacitor is empty (read 0), but if we detect
    electricity, then the capacitor must be charged (read 1). You might notice that
    reading a capacitor drains its electron store, modern RAMs have the circuitry
    to periodically recharge capacitor so they can retain their memory as long as
    there is electricity.

    sense of time.

    clock ticks electricity passes through the logic gates to calculate the output
    from the input (I1, I2, R(t)); and *in* the clock ticks, the tape writer will
    write O1,O2 to the tape, the motor will move depending on the value of M, and
    the internal register is written from the value of R(t+1), then the tape reader
    will read the current tape and put charge into I1,I2 and the internal register
    is reread back to R(t).

    The other commonly used alternative, asynchronous transmission uses another wire,
    called the interrupt line, to communicate synchronization points between the CPU
