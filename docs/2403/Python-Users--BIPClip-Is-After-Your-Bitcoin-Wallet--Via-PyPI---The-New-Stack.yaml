- en: With Bitcoin values hovering over $70,000, the cryptocurrency has become a big
    deal again. So it can come as no surprise that cybersecurity firm ReversingLabs
    has [uncovered](https://www.reversinglabs.com/blog/bipclip-malicious-pypi-packages-target-crypto-wallet-recovery-passwords)
    a nefarious hacking campaign aimed at pilfering cryptocurrency wallet recovery
    phrases. And that campaign uses [Python](https://thenewstack.io/what-is-python/)
    as its base.

    by masquerading as a [useful open source library](https://thenewstack.io/vendoring-why-you-still-have-overlooked-security-holes/).
    This sophisticated operation involves seven ingeniously crafted open source packages,
    each with multiple versions. These packages target the mnemonic phrases based
    on the [Bitcoin Improvement Proposal 39 (BIP39)](https://trezor.io/learn/a/what-is-bip39)
    standard.

    They’re used to generate a binary seed that, in turn, [creates deterministic Bitcoin](https://thenewstack.io/create-bitcoin-buy-and-sell-alerts-with-influxdb/)
    wallets. These wallets can be seamlessly shared across systems, using a set of
    2,048 words that are easier for humans to remember than traditional binary or
    hexadecimal seed representations.

    and *bip39_mnemonic_decrypt*, which are used to exfiltrate sensitive data used
    to protect cryptocurrency wallets. *Mnemonic_to_address* acts as a “clean” package
    with the malicious *bip39_mnemonic_decrypt* listed as a dependency. *Mnemonic_to_address*
    implements its advertised functionality of creating a seed from the user’s secret
    mnemonic phrase. It does this by forwarding the BIP39 data to functions imported
    from a legitimate project: [Ethereum](https://github.com/ethereum)‘s [eth-account](https://github.com/ethereum/eth-account).'

    this by encoding the provided mnemonic passphrase using Base64 and then sending
    it to the exfiltration server using an [HTTP POST request](https://thenewstack.io/blockchain-direct-http-requests-via-the-internet-computer/).
    It further disguises the passphrase by hiding it in the “license” data field.

- en: ReversingLabs’ deep dive into the mechanics of BIPClip revealed a complex web
    of dependencies designed to evade detection. The operation’s stealthiness is underscored
    by the discovery of additional packages, such as HashSnake, in early March, further
    expanding the BIPClip campaign’s reach. This strategy of camouflage, coupled with
    the deliberate use of throwaway PyPI maintainer accounts, underscores the lengths
    to which these attackers will go to mask their true intentions.

    to have been mitigated swiftly, with the malicious [packages removed from PyPI](https://thenewstack.io/poisoned-lolip0p-pypi-packages/)
    shortly after their discovery. However, the number of downloads prior to their
    removal suggests a potentially wider spread than anticipated, highlighting the
    ongoing risks posed by [software supply chain attacks](https://thenewstack.io/lessons-learned-from-2021-software-supply-chain-attacks/).

    as a stark reminder of the persistent threats facing the cryptocurrency sector.
    If you work with cryptocurrency, you must bolster your defenses against such insidious
    threats.
