- en: I recently got laid off and got 100% custody of my MacBook Pro. I‚Äôm not a fan
    of macOS, but I run it because Apple‚Äôs systems are locked down. Not anymore. Asahi
    Linux has come a long way, spawning Fedora Asahi and, more recently, [Ubuntu Asahi](https://ubuntuasahi.org/).
    Ubuntu has been my primary operating system for ~14 years, so the chance of running
    it natively on my MacBook Pro was appetizing.

    version was v0.7.1 (the current version at the time of this writing). It was refreshingly
    simple. Follow the [instructions on the website](https://ubuntuasahi.org/), and
    you‚Äôre good to go.

    time. In the other 20%, sound ‚Äúmesses up,‚Äù where I can‚Äôt alter the volume, the
    audio sounds loud and shrill, and it wants to blow out the speakers. I‚Äôm not sure
    of the cause, but it‚Äôs annoying. Fortunately, I use earphones with a laptop, so
    it doesn‚Äôt affect me often.

    Meet. If I try it in Firefox, the mic is detected but doesn‚Äôt work. The mic simply
    can‚Äôt be found when I use Google Meet in Chromium. Weird.

- en: My last hardware note has to do with battery life. I read a note about Asahi
    Linux somewhere mentioning that it gets the same battery life out of Apple Silicon
    as macOS does. I found this to be true, sometimes. I frequently observe that battery
    life depletes at the pace I‚Äôm used to with macOS. The problem for me is around
    closing the laptop lid. I don‚Äôt know what happens behind the scenes, but sometimes,
    after a few hours, the battery would have only depleted 2%, and sometimes 30%.

- en: The software is the most significant issue I‚Äôve had with Ubuntu Asahi thus far,
    but I have good news here. The problems aren‚Äôt with packages that ship with Ubuntu
    but with one exception. Gnome Shell crashes on me once in a while. Similar to
    the battery issue, it only happens, if it happens, when I have locked the screen
    (via the keyboard or by closing the lid). When this happens, I have to reopen
    any apps that I previously had. This Gnome Shell issue is why I would not recommend
    Ubuntu Asahi as a daily driver. If you‚Äôre working on important files and Gnome
    Shell crashes, that will lead to frustration.

    You might assume some of the less Linux-centric software might have this issue,
    but even veterans such as Firefox and PostgreSQL have been an issue.

- en: Let‚Äôs start with Google Chrome. Like many modern tech people, I spend an abnormally
    large portion of my computer time in a browser. My browser of choice is Google
    Chrome. I won‚Äôt get into browser politics today, but I like Chrome and use a lot
    of its features. A few of which aren‚Äôt in Chromium. Google Chrome is not compiled
    for Linux/arm64. Do they have builds on Arm for macOS? Yes. Windows? Yes. But
    not Linux. This uneven platform support is a major pain for me.

- en: I begrudgingly decided to use Firefox on Ubuntu Asahi, but I wanted to make
    a quick change. Canonical decided to force the use of the Firefox snap over the
    .deb in Ubuntu a few releases ago. [I‚Äôm no fan of snaps](/blog/breaking-up-with-snap/),
    so I tried to switch over to using the official Mozilla deb repository for Firefox
    but ran into an issue. The repository doesn‚Äôt currently support arm64. I had to
    use the PPA instead.

    tried to install them. Mattermost worked, but Slack, Todoist, Simple Note, Spotify,
    and Telegram did not. Again, the snaps don‚Äôt support arm64.

    arm64, it turns out [the Flatpak does](https://flathub.org/apps/org.telegram.desktop).
    üòâ A little while later, while listening to the [Linux Matters](https://linuxmatters.sh/)
    podcast, I found out that one of the co-hosts, Alan, made his own [Telegram snap](https://snapcraft.io/telegram-asahi)
    specifically for use with Ubuntu Asahi. While this is awesome, both options are
    community-made, so use them at your own risk.

- en: Lastly, I‚Äôll touch on PostgreSQL. Since Ubuntu Asahi‚Äôs newest supported Ubuntu
    release is Ubuntu 23.10, the latest version of Postgres it includes in the repos
    is v15. I needed v16. Postgres provides repos, but there‚Äôs a fun twist. They provide
    arm64 builds, only for Ubuntu LTS releases, which I‚Äôm not using. This is another
    compatibility issue for me with Ubuntu Asahi.

    my review. I only listed the problems that I had because listing everything that
    worked would take a book‚Äôs worth of text. Ubuntu Asahi builds on the great work
    the Asahi Linux team, Canonical, and the Ubuntu community have been doing, giving
    them a terrific start.

    yes if you had more than one machine to use. If you only have a single computer
    to use, I would hold off for now. I don‚Äôt think the project is far off from being
    stable, though. Depending on their momentum, I can give them a solid yes before
    2024 is over. I‚Äôm excited to see where the project goes.
