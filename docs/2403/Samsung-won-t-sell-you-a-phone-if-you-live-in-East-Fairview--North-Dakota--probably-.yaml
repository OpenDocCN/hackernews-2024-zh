    a website, most of what you type is never used. In the United States, the only
    thing that matters most of the time is the ZIP Code. I have placed orders online
    with a billing address to the name “Dingus Dingus,” and it went through just fine.
    In my experiences working in restaurants, old-school card terminals never even
    ask for a complete address - they just ask for a ZIP Code.'

    because they allow invoices to be sent to one address while the actual product
    gets shipped somewhere else. However, a billing address’s only purpose for regular
    folks like me is that very rudimentary form of verification. When done correctly,
    that verification *only* uses the ZIP Code.

    can enhance the security of this system by validating a larger chunk of the address,

    city or state will make that password longer, right? And that’s good!

    That means that bits and pieces of many towns can share a single ZIP Code. But,
    the USPS designates a “[Recommended City Name](https://tools.usps.com/zip-code-lookup.htm?citybyzipcode)”
    to each ZIP Code to simplify things. “Milwaukee” is my ZIP Code’s recommended
    city name, so that’s the city that shows up on a lot of my mail. You aren’t *required*
    to write the recommended city name, though. The correct city name is also valid,
    and it can be helpful to reduce ambiguity about a package’s intended destination.

    if you live in 48203, you might actually live in Detroit, but your mail will say
    “Highland Park.” Other ZIP Codes contain many towns - one of the crazier examples
    I found is 55118, where your mail will say “Saint Paul” even though you might
    live in any one of *four* other towns within that ZIP Code’s limits.

    to verify a buyer’s identity.** Multiple combinations of city and state can correspond
    to the exact same physical address, and those combinations can and should be used
    interchangeably, because that’s how the mail works.

    myself. I’ve spent hours grokking bank statements, chatting with Samsung support
    representatives, and talking with bank support folks. I have tried *FOURTEEN TIMES*
    to buy a Samsung Galaxy S24 from their website, using five different payment methods
    on four browsers, three different devices, three different email addresses, and
    two different phone numbers. I have placed orders as a guest. I created a Samsung
    account and tried to place an order that way. When that didn’t work, I made *another*
    Samsung account and tried again. I must admit that some of the following is conjecture,
    but I like to think it’s based on an adequate amount of research.

    can’t even place an order on Samsung’s website unless you use the USPS recommended
    city name corresponding to your billing ZIP Code.** Clicking the “Place Order”
    button will simply cause an error message to appear at the top of the page. This
    is incorrect behavior. Even the [USPS’s system](https://tools.usps.com/zip-code-lookup.htm?citybyzipcode)
    will tell you it’s totally fine to write the names of the other towns within the
    ZIP code, as all of those city-ZIP combinations are valid.

    networks only validate the ZIP Code, the transaction will go through without a
    hitch. That lines up with my experience - all of my banks happily accepted Samsung’s
    transactions when the ZIP Code matched their records, and rejected Samsung’s transactions
    when the ZIP Code didn’t match their records. From the bank’s perspective, everything
    is going swimmingly. However, Samsung tried to be clever, and in doing so, they
    have completely broken their billing system.

    bank isn’t as stupid as Samsung, though, so they might actually have the correct
    city on file. If your bank has your actual city on file, instead of the other
    city that Samsung forced you to write, Samsung will cancel your order, send your
    money back, and then send you a vague email about how they somehow **“couldn’t
    verify your info,” even though they just charged and refunded several hundred
    dollars to your account.**'

    to help, but he came up empty-handed just like me. My issue ended up getting “elevated,”
    whatever that means. I was told to expect a “response in 24-48 hours.” It has
    been 4 days, and I’ve gotten nothing. Of course, Samsung’s competent, intelligent
    support professionals can’t just place the order for me. That would allow them
    to be helpful, which means it’s too much power for them to wield. Or something
    like that.

    Their e-commerce service makes false assumptions about how addresses work, and

    Samsung, with all its money and engineering prowess, has crafted the worst e-commerce

    effective system for delivering the mail. In 2023, the USPS processed [127.3 billion](https://about.usps.com/who/government-relations/assets/usps-by-the-numbers-2023.pdf)
    pieces of mail, and their total operating expenses were [$85.4 billion](https://about.usps.com/newsroom/national-releases/2023/1114-usps-reports-fiscal-year-2023-results.htm).
    That’s about 67 cents per piece of mail, one cent less than a regular postage
    stamp. ZIP Codes are weird, but the end result is remarkably cost-effective.
