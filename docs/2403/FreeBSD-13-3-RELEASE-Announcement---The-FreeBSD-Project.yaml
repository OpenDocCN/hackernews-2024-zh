- en: FreeBSD 13.3-RELEASE is now available for the amd64, i386, powerpc, powerpc64,
    powerpc64le, powerpcspe, armv6, armv7, aarch64, and riscv64 architectures.

    Some architectures also support installing from a USB memory stick. The required
    files can be downloaded as described in the section below.

    the documentation, debugging distribution sets, and a small set of pre-built packages
    aimed at getting a graphical workstation up and running. It also supports booting
    into a "livefs" based rescue mode. This should be all you need if you can burn
    and use DVD-sized media.
