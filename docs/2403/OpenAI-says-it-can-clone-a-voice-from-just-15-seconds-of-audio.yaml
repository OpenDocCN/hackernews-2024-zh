- en: OpenAI just announced that it [](https://openai.com/blog/navigating-the-challenges-and-opportunities-of-synthetic-voices)
    of a new tool called Voice Engine. This is a voice cloning technology that can
    mimic any speaker by analyzing a 15-second audio sample. The company says it generates
    “natural-sounding speech” with “emotive and realistic voices.”

    and it has been in the works since 2022\. OpenAI has already been using a version
    of the toolset to power the preset voices available in the current text-to-speech
    API and the Read Aloud feature. There are a bunch of samples on the company’s
    official blog and they sound eerily close to the real thing. I encourage you to
    give them a listen and imagine the possibilities, both good and bad.

    translation and helping those who suffer from sudden or degenerative speech conditions.
    The company brought up a [](https://livox.com.br/en/) that helped a patient with
    speech impairment issues by creating a Voice Engine clone pulled from audio recorded
    for a school project.

    to engage in some serious deepfake tomfoolery, [](https://www.engadget.com/phony-ai-biden-robocalls-reached-up-to-25000-voters-says-new-hampshire-ag-205253966.html).
    With this in mind, Voice Engine isn’t quite ready for prime time, as there are
    serious privacy concerns that must be met before a full rollout.

    top of mind in an election year.” The company says its incorporating feedback
    from “US and international partners from across government, media, entertainment,
    education, civil society and beyond” to ensure the product launches with a minimal
    amount of risk. All preview testers agreed to OpenAI’s usage policies, which ban
    the impersonation of another individual without consent or legal right.

    that the voices are AI-generated. OpenAI implemented safety measures, like watermarking
    to trace the origin of any audio and “proactive monitoring” of how the system
    is being used. When the product officially rolls out there will be a “no-go voice
    list” that detects and prevents AI-generated speakers that are too similar to
    prominent figures.

    [](https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/29/openai-custom-voice-engine-preview/) and
    it looks like it will undercut [](https://www.engadget.com/elevenlabs-reportedly-banned-the-account-that-deepfaked-bidens-voice-with-its-ai-tools-083355975.html).
    Voice Engine could cost $15 per one million characters, which works out to around
    162,500 words. This is about the length of Stephen King’s *The Shining*. It certainly
    sounds like a budget-friendly way to get an audiobook done. The marketing materials
    also make reference to an “HD” version that costs twice as much, but the company
    hasn’t detailed how that will work.

    with its bestie Microsoft to build an AI-based supercomputer called “Stargate.”
    The project will reportedly cost a whopping $100 billion, [](https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=ba0a4cdc-cec8-416a-9e93-e11b8179129c&siteId=us-engadget&pageId=1p-autolink&featureId=text-link&merchantName=The+Information&custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGVpbmZvcm1hdGlvbi5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZXMvbWljcm9zb2Z0LWFuZC1vcGVuYWktcGxvdC0xMDAtYmlsbGlvbi1zdGFyZ2F0ZS1haS1zdXBlcmNvbXB1dGVyP3V0bV9jYW1wYWlnbj1FZGl0b3JpYWwmdXRtX2NvbnRlbnQ9QXJ0aWNsZSZ1dG1fbWVkaXVtPW9yZ2FuaWNfc29jaWFsJnV0bV9zb3VyY2U9dHdpdHRlciIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiMGU5Y2VhOTYtZDdhYi00ZDY0LTk4MTUtMWRiMzdjMDFhMzBkIn0&signature=AQAAASDeVBgrVkfdCEjIBLm_Js7LqSINrM5_J3oWcpd-nn5M&gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theinformation.com%2Farticles%2Fmicrosoft-and-openai-plot-100-billion-stargate-ai-supercomputer%3Futm_campaign%3DEditorial%26utm_content%3DArticle%26utm_medium%3Dorganic_social%26utm_source%3Dtwitter)
