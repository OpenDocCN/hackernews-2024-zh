- en: LOS ANGELES (AP) — A Southern California police department has been handcuffed
    by Lego after the toy company asked the agency to stop adding Lego heads to cover
    the faces of suspects in images it shares on social media.

    people’s faces in posts on social sites since at least early 2023\. But the altered
    photos went viral last week after the department posted a statement about its
    policy, prompting several news articles and, later, the request from Lego.

    that featured five people in a lineup, their faces covered by Lego heads with
    varying expressions. The post went on to reference a California law that took
    effect Jan. 1, limiting departments in sharing mugshots on social media.

- en: Across the U.S., law enforcement agencies have often posted galleries of photos
    for “Mugshot Mondays” and “Wanted Wednesdays” to social media in efforts to bolster
    community engagement. But experts increasingly point to the harmful effects of
    putting such images online. For people awaiting trial, mugshots can carry a presumption
    of guilt. And for anyone seeking to move past a criminal conviction, the images
    can make it hard to get a job and haunt them for the rest of their lives.

    required to remove any booking photo they shared on social media — including of
    people arrested for violent offenses — within 14 days unless specific circumstances
    exist, like the person remains a fugitive and an imminent threat to public safety.

    The prior law prohibited posting mugshots of all non-violent offenders unless
    those circumstances exist. It also said departments should remove mugshots already
    posted to social media identifying any defendant who requests it if they can prove
    their record was sealed, their conviction was expunged or they were found not
    guilty, among a handful of other reasons.

    in general and announced a new department policy on Instagram in January 2023\.
    The community had requested more of their “Weekly Roundup” posts, so the department
    said it started using the Lego heads and emojis to comply with the law while still
    engaging with Murrieta residents.
