- en: Chipmaker Nvidia has shown off a clone of our entire planet that could help
    meteorologists simulate and visualize global weather patterns at an "unprecedented
    scale," according to a [press release](https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-announces-earth-climate-digital-twin).

- en: The "Earth climate digital twin," dubbed Earth-2, was designed to help recoup
    some of the economic losses caused by climate change-driven extreme weather.

- en: Customers can access the digital twin through an API, allowing "virtually any
    user to create AI-powered emulations to speed delivery of interactive, high-resolution
    simulations ranging from the global atmosphere and local cloud cover to typhoons
    and turbulence."

- en: The company is hoping to help improve early warning systems for natural disasters
    and improve weather forecasts — and in a matter of seconds, not "minutes or hours
    in traditional CPU-driven modeling."

- en: Nvidia claims the new platform is both 1,000 faster at generating predictive
    images than current models and 3,000 times more energy efficient thanks to a —
    you guessed it — generative AI model called CorrDiff.

    and generational floods appear in the news with alarming frequency," said Nvidia
    founder and CEO Jensen Huang in a statement. "Earth-2 cloud APIs strive to help
    us better prepare for — and inspire us to act to moderate — extreme weather."'

    their extreme weather modeling. For instance, the Central Weather Administration
    of Taiwan wants to use the platform to forecast the precise locations of where
    typhoons will make landfall.

    of weather conditions.

- en: The platform is the latest sign of Nvidia's ascendancy. Especially with the
    advent of generative AI tools, the tech world has [become ravenous](https://futurism.com/the-byte/zuckerberg-bored-metaverse-ai-chips)
    for Nvidia's graphics cards or GPUs, which not only power those models, but platforms
    like Earth-2 as well.

- en: By turning its attention to climate change and the disastrous consequences of
    extreme weather, Nvidia is weaponizing its AI tech for a fight that's only bound
    to grow in the near future. The only question? Whether it'll be accurate in the
    long term.
