    in Python has mostly converged in using Python as a wrapper to call faster functions
    written in faster languages. So, when using Python for processing data of significant
    size, we mostly avoid loops, and we look for a pandas (or similar tool) function
    where someone implemented the loop for us in C or another lower level language.
    For example `df.pow(2)` will loop over every item in our dataframe and square
    it, but we don't loop in Python, we tell pandas to do it, and pandas will call
    a C function that performs the loop and the operation much faster than Python
    would. In this case the loop it's implemented in NumPy which pandas uses.

    than the fastest pandas engine. The results with DuckDB are surprising, as DuckDB
    in general has performance similar to Polars. A major refactoring of DuckDB CSV
    parser happened just before writing this blog post. The new version seems much
    faster, and its performance is similar to pandas with PyArrow. In other benchmarks
    (which I guess depend less on how fast a CSV file is read and parsed, DuckDB is
    usually one of the fastest implementations, with similar speed to Polars. At least
    in the [TPCH benchmark suite](https://pola.rs/posts/benchmarks/). As I said earlier,
    being faster (or slower) for this particular use case doesn't mean being consistently
    faster or slower, even if correlation surely exists.

    the `csv` crate / package causes a much higher number of branch mispredictions
    than iterating the file character by character. To briefly explain what a branch
    misprediction is, let's say that a CPU has a queue with all the instructions it
    needs to execute, so the next is ready when one finishes. But then code has conditional
    statements (an `if`) and only one of the code when the condition is `true` or
    when the condition is `false` can be the next in the queue. So, when populating
    the queue the operating system will make a guess on what the result of the condition
    is going to be before evaluating it and really knowing. And it'll add to the queue
    the instructions that seems more likely to be the next. When the guess is wrong,
    it takes some time to bring the actual code that needs to run to the queue from
    outside the CPU. When we write code at this low level, and we care about performance
    to the millisecond we want to help the compiler and the operating system make
    the best guesses so the queue contains the right code as often as possible and
    the minimum amount of time is lost.

    like loading all the file into memory before parsing it, loading one row at a
    time... The fastest option for this kind of operation is using a memory map. Memory
    maps are a feature (syscall) of operating systems where the kernel will map virtual
    memory addresses to a file in disk. When using memory maps the Linux kernel is
    quite smart at preloading data into memory before it's needed, as well as to preload
    the data into the memory caches. It can be even smarter if we give the kernel
    hints on how this memory is going to be accessed. In our case, we are going to
    access the file in sequential order, so if we let the Linux kernel know this when
    setting up the memory map, the kernel is going to speed up our program significantly.

    multiple CPUs, and we can split the work the CPU needs to do among them. So, if
    we have work for 1 second of CPU, but we have 4 CPUs, we can get our program finish
    in 0.25 seconds. In practice the time will be much more than 0.25 seconds, but
    we can surely speed up things significantly. Also, many modern CPUs provide parallelism
    in a single CPU via SIMD operations. Where an operation can be applied to multiple
    values at the same time. I didn't implement SIMD in my tests here, but that could
    be another option.

    a CSV we want to first extract each value as a string, and then cast it to the
    appropriate type. In this case, since I was mostly parsing integer values, I can
    build the number while reading the characters. So, if I first find a `"2"` I just
    cast it to an integer. If after that I find a `"4"`, I multiply the previous value
    `2` by `10` and add the `4` I just found to get the 24\. If I keep repeating this
    until I find the comma, I already have the number parsed. This approach seems
    to be significantly faster than parsing the number from a reference to the whole
    string. What's even better in this particular case, since I'll square all numbers,
    I don't care if they are positive or negative, and I can completely ignore the
    sign.

- en: So, whether using a single CPU or all, my final implementation is 2x times faster
    than Polars. Obviously, using Polars or another generic tool makes more sense
    in most cases, as the development time of implementing the pipeline is a fraction
    than implementing the whole parsing from scratch. But in cases when performance
    is a top priority, these results seem to show that it's possible to process CSV
    files significantly faster than the faster generic implementation.
