- en: A good answer to this is to use word probabilities. You could have a reference
    text with a range of different texts from which you calculate how likely a word
    is to be used. You could tune this based on actual usage, too. If someone types
    "cobalt" a lot (I don't know why they would, but okay :D), you could rank "Cobalt"
    higher when choosing a word to recommend for the string "co".

- en: The trie is a deeply nested tree. The structure is commonly used for predictive
    text engines because you can represent all strings as a tree. Then, you can use
    word probabilities to decide on what word you should recommend. This could be
    done by using a reference corpus of millions of words from English publications
    to identify how common dfifferent words are.

- en: The trie is a tree data structure. In a trie, every node has a value for the
    node itself and a set of nodes that you can traverse. You can represent words
    as a trie to efficiently find all words that start with a given prefix. Because
    you can give each node a value, you can attach probabilities to each word in the
    trie. This is ideal for next word prediction, where you can extract candidates
    for a next word from the trie using letters someone has already typed and then
    rank them based on the probabilities associated with each node.
  id: totrans-split-54

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You can also find if a word is not in the trie efficiently. To do so, you would
    split up a word (i.e. "codep") into its letters and search for each one `trie["c"]["o"]["d"]["e"]["p"]`.
    If there is no value associated with the result, you know the word is not in the
    tree.
