    mismatch, early research suggests that a lack of experience and familiarity with
    AI could help explain the comprehension gap between younger and older audiences.
    For instance, in an August 2023 AARP and NORC [survey](https://www.norc.org/research/library/older-adults-express-mixed-views-artificial-intelligence.html#:~:text=An%20August%20Foresight%2050%2B%20Omnibus,were%20very%20familiar%20with%20it.)

    published last month in the journal *Scientific Reports*, scientists showed 201
    participants a mix of AI- and human-generated images and gauged their responses
    based on factors like age, gender, and attitudes toward technology. The team found

    researchers have found similar results with AI-made audio. Last year, the University

    video, or still images—may more easily trick older viewers through a broader “blanket
    effect.” BothHerrmann and Grassini suggest that older generations may not learn
    about the hallmarks of AI-generated content and encounter it as much in their
    daily lives, leaving them more vulnerable when it pops up on their screens. Cognitive
    decline and hearing loss (in the case of audio) may play a role, but Grassini
    still observed the effect in people in their late forties and early fifties.
