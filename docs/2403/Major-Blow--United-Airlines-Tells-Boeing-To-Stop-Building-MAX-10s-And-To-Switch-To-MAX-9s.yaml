- en: The bad news keeps coming for Boeing, one of the world’s most storied aircraft
    manufacturers. Recent headlines, such as the Alaska Airlines Boeing 737 MAX 9
    door plug blowout and missing documentation regarding the work done on that plane,
    have certainly not been favorable for Boeing. And today’s remarks from Scott Kirby
    are a massive statement regarding United's trust, or lack thereof, in the manufacturer.

- en: Earlier today, during the J.P. Morgan Industrials Conference, Kirby, United’s
    CEO, said the airline had told Boeing to stop making MAX 10s and instead replace
    those with MAX 9s. In January, after the Alaska Airlines incident, Kirby said
    that United would need to consider planning a future without the MAX 10, as it
    is still pending certification. Early this month, Simple Flying reported that
    those plans had already been made. As of March 1, United was still awaiting 34
    MAX 9s, more than half of which it expects to receive this year. At this time,
    it is unclear how many MAX 10s will be swapped for 9s.

    MAX 10s between now and after 2025\. The filing outlined the deliveries expected
    in 2024 and 2025, detailing the numbers for its Airbus A321neos, Boeing 787s,
    and 737 MAX 8s and 9s. United specified that the removal of the MAX 10 from its
    delivery outlook was due to the unknown certification timeframe for the largest
    variant of the MAX family.

    that United was hoping to swap orders for the MAX 10 for the Airbus A321neo, the
    newest addition to the airline's fleet. Currently, United's commitment to A321neos
    totals 126 aircraft, [following its second order for 60 planes, placed in October](https://simpleflying.com/united-airlines-order-more-boeing-787-airbus-a321neo/).

    become the launch customer for the type whenever it is certified. In addition
    to its 277 aircraft on firm order, it has options for a further 200\. However,
    it's uncertain what this deal would eventually look like.
