    to come, but the severity of the crisis itself is, at this point, beyond question.
    Members of Gen Z, who were born between the mid-to-late nineties and the early
    twenty-tens, tend to be lonelier than the members of previous generations. They
    are more anxious and depressed; they get less sleep. They more commonly think
    that their lives hold no meaning. They are more likely to harm themselves or experience
    suicidal ideation. (Suicide deaths among children ages ten to fourteen more than
    [doubled](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2022/04/11/the-mystifying-rise-of-child-suicide)
    between 2007 and 2017.) They are more wary of, or just less interested in, the
    things that were once milestones of freedom: drinking, dating, having sex, getting
    driver’s licenses, moving out of their parents’ houses.'

    in “[The Anxious Generation: How the Great Rewiring of Childhood Is Causing an
    Epidemic of Mental Illness](https://www.amazon.com/Anxious-Generation-Rewiring-Childhood-Epidemic/dp/0593655036),”
    “people born in and after 1996 were different, psychologically, from those who
    had been born just a few years earlier.” From childhood, Haidt suggests, they
    suffer from a weak “psychological immune system—the ability of a child to handle,
    process, and get past frustrations, minor accidents, teasing, exclusion, perceived
    injustices, and normal conflicts without falling prey to hours or days of inner
    turmoil.” This immunosuppression persists into adolescence and beyond, fostering
    higher proportions of nervous, avoidant young adults.'

    oldest members of Gen Z were in middle school in 2009 and 2010, when Facebook
    added the Like button, Twitter added the Retweet option, and smartphones’ front-facing
    cameras became ubiquitous, launching the age of the selfie. The effect of these
    tools, Haidt writes, was to attach kids to “a firehose of social comparison” that
    pummelled their self-esteem at a critical moment of cognitive and psychological
    development. Studies show that, the more kids use [social media](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/the-weekend-essay/coming-of-age-at-the-dawn-of-the-social-internet),
    the more likely they are to experience anxiety and depression; girls, Black children,
    and L.G.B.T.Q. youth are hit hardest. (Boys over all, hypnotized by porn and video
    games, don’t fare hugely better than girls.) And constant discussion and self-diagnosis
    of mental-health disorders on TikTok, Instagram, and elsewhere may contribute
    to what two University of Oxford researchers call “[prevalence inflation](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0732118X2300003X),”
    in which people mistake everyday stress and discomfort as signs of a serious disorder
    “in a way that is ultimately self-fulfilling.” As an example, the scholars note
    that “interpreting low levels of anxiety as symptomatic of an anxiety disorder
    might lead to behavioural avoidance, which can further exacerbate anxiety symptoms.”

    the late two-thousands and early twenty-tens, children were also spending less
    and less time engaged in unstructured, largely unsupervised play with their peers.
    This deprivation owed to their parents’ concerns for their safety—a fretfulness
    known as “safetyism”—and to a competitive, college-fixated mind-set that prioritized
    adult-led, résumé-building, and “enrichment” activities. Unaccompanied kids doing
    normal kid things like walking home from school or visiting a playground became
    conspicuous, strange, perhaps even the subject of a 911 call or a C.P.S. investigation.

    reading social cues, making friends, and resolving conflicts. Improvisational,
    unmonitored play functions as exposure therapy for life itself. In a [commentary](https://www.jpeds.com/article/S0022-3476(23)00111-7/abstract)
    published last year in *The Journal of Pediatrics* which summarized the causal
    links between free play and mental health, the authors declared that “the decline
    in children’s independent activity and, hence, in mental wellbeing is a national
    and international health crisis and should be treated as such.”

    tradition. Elders have always overreacted to the supposedly mind-altering properties
    of certain technological advancements, from the printing press to the television
    set. Haidt is one of America’s more prominent hand-wringers about kids these days,
    owing to a viral *Atlantic* [piece](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2015/09/the-coddling-of-the-american-mind/399356/)
    that he co-authored, in 2015, with the attorney and free-speech activist Greg
    Lukianoff, headlined “The Coddling of the American Mind.” In that article, and
    in the [2018 book](https://www.amazon.com/Coddling-American-Mind-Intentions-Generation/dp/0735224897)
    of the same name, Haidt and Lukianoff portrayed a bubble-wrapped generation that
    had been raised to be “fragile, anxious, and easily hurt,” and railed against
    what they identified as a student-directed movement “to scrub campuses clean of
    words, ideas, and subjects that might cause discomfort or give offense.” The corrosive
    cleaning agents, according to the authors, included trigger warnings, spurious
    talk of “microaggressions,” and demands for “safe spaces.” Haidt and Lukianoff
    argued that Gen Z victims of safetyism were also, in higher ed, its most aggressive
    perpetrators.

    title promised, but Haidt and Lukianoff’s reflexive disdain for left-leaning youth
    and weakness for caricature had a flattening effect on their analysis. Haidt had
    risen to public-intellectual fame in the early two-thousands via his work on positive
    psychology, but “Coddling” turned him into a folk hero in a frequently specious
    war against cancel culture, winning him fans among the revanchist likes of Joe
    Rogan, [Bari Weiss](https://www.newyorker.com/news/annals-of-activism/is-it-possible-to-be-both-moderate-and-anti-woke),
    and Jordan Peterson. He has often taken a both-sides approach to political conflict
    that equates leftist activism with deadly right-wing extremism. (A section in
    “Coddling” that deals with the 2017 “Unite the Right” rally of white supremacists
    and the counter-demonstrators it drew, in Charlottesville, is an especially egregious
    example of this tendency.) He has been [beset](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBNtOCCSSRc)
    by a troubling fixation on the heritability of I.Q.—a contention widely dismissed
    as scientific racism—and the purported accuracy of stereotypes. He once [argued](https://nypost.com/2018/12/04/angry-parents-lash-out-at-doe-official-over-desegregation-plan/)

    Great Point,” but I had never felt the heat of his proud, stoic gaze until I found
    myself nodding along in agreement with much of “The Anxious Generation.”'

    is, to a considerable extent, a reiteration and expansion of “Coddling.” But it
    is also a vastly superior work. It’s less hung up on campus-outrage stuff, and
    it benefits from six additional years of research on how smartphones and social
    media dice the nerves and tamp the spirits of young people, particularly those
    between the ages of ten and fifteen. These established links are now the stuff
    of [Surgeon General’s advisories](https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/sg-youth-mental-health-social-media-advisory.pdf),

    for what Haidt sums up as “*overprotection in the real world and underprotection
    in the virtual world*.” In “The Anxious Generation,” Haidt makes four core appeals
    to parents and educators: more unstructured free play for children, no smartphones
    before high school, no social media before age sixteen, and no phones in schools.
    All of these strike me as not just reasonable but irrefutably necessary. What
    is less clear is whether there is enough collective and institutional will to
    accomplish them.'

- en: During the past year, I’ve been interviewing parents who have attempted to block
    or strictly limit their tween and teen-age children’s use of smartphones and social
    media. Conversations with these parents—all of whom live in the New York City
    area, and whose kids attend a mix of public, charter, and private schools—hit
    common refrains. Parents worried about their kids saying or doing something foolish
    that, if captured and circulated via smartphone, would haunt them for the rest
    of their lives. They were infuriated that [tech companies](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2024/02/05/can-the-internet-be-governed),
    abiding by federal law, effectively give kids online emancipation from their parents
    at the arbitrary and absurdly young age of thirteen and, even then, barely bother
    with age verification. (One talked about falsifying her kid’s birth date on Google’s
    Family Link in order to keep full control over the service.) They lamented the
    friction and distrust sown by devices—I heard about kids who kept surreptitiously
    changing the parental settings on their social media, or who have finstas full
    of duck face and provocation, or who sneak phones into their bedrooms and stay
    up with them all night.

    their child a device but felt they had no choice once the kid started taking the
    subway or walking to school without adult accompaniment. And I was surprised by
    the extent to which G.P.S. location-tracking of kids is treated as a given, as
    ubiquitous and indispensable as backpacks and sneakers. Several parents said that
    they weren’t sure how to balance preserving their children’s privacy—their ability
    to have a sacred space carved out from their parents to grow into themselves—and
    monitoring their online and offline behavior in order to keep them safe. One told
    me, “I am definitely a helicopter parent, and my generation is full of helicopter
    parents, because we’ve given them access to this, like, *horrifying void*.”

    media simultaneously fills and widens that emptiness. Although online forums can
    provide some of the togetherness that young people crave, ideally, Haidt writes,
    most of their interactions should unfold in person, unmediated by screens, which
    requires emotional effort and investment. In reading “The Anxious Generation”
    and speaking with parents, I frequently thought about what the late literary and
    cultural theorist [Lauren Berlant](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/03/25/affect-theory-and-the-new-age-of-anxiety)
    called “the inconvenience of other people”—the “affective sense of the familiar
    friction of being in relation. At a minimum, inconvenience is the force that makes
    one shift a little while processing the world.” Using your mind and body to interact
    extemporaneously with other minds and bodies is a skill that dulled during the
    pandemic; it can be boring, or frustrating, or distressing; it demands time, compromise,
    and accommodation. The inconvenient person, Berlant wrote, is “someone you trip
    over, even just in your mind.” Kids need to trip over people and ideas, at the
    risk of scraping up their psyches, in order to learn how to move through the world
    and how to connect meaningfully with the people in it.

    their self-image, but they believe, as several parents told me, that giving up
    their phones would kill their social lives. Research has shown that, when adolescents
    abstain from social media for a while, their mental health improves even as their
    isolation from their friends who are still on the platforms increases; a smart,
    emotionally intelligent kid can recognize the merits of this trade-off and still
    choose to keep their TikTok and Snapchat accounts. (A University of Chicago [working
    paper](https://bfi.uchicago.edu/working-paper/2023-131/) published last year found
    that fifty-seven per cent of college students who are active users of Instagram
    would “prefer to live in a world without the platform.”) One parent talked about
    her daughter’s experience at a prestigious summer program, where, not long after
    arriving, she found herself sitting with a group of other new arrivals; rather
    than getting acquainted, the rest of the kids were all staring at their phones,
    and she didn’t have one. She told her mother, “It was so stupid. But, in that
    moment, I wanted to be stupid, too.”
