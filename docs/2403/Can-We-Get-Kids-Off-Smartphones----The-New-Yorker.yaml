- en: 'The exact causes of the Gen Z mental-health emergency will be parsed for years
    to come, but the severity of the crisis itself is, at this point, beyond question.
    Members of Gen Z, who were born between the mid-to-late nineties and the early
    twenty-tens, tend to be lonelier than the members of previous generations. They
    are more anxious and depressed; they get less sleep. They more commonly think
    that their lives hold no meaning. They are more likely to harm themselves or experience
    suicidal ideation. (Suicide deaths among children ages ten to fourteen more than
    [doubled](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2022/04/11/the-mystifying-rise-of-child-suicide)
    between 2007 and 2017.) They are more wary of, or just less interested in, the
    things that were once milestones of freedom: drinking, dating, having sex, getting
    driver’s licenses, moving out of their parents’ houses.'

  zh: Gen Z心理健康紧急情况的确切原因将在未来几年被详细解析，但目前危机的严重性已不容置疑。出生于九十年代中期至二十一世纪初期的Gen Z成员比以往任何一代人更孤独。他们更焦虑、更抑郁；他们睡眠更少。他们更普遍地认为他们的生活毫无意义。他们更可能自伤或产生自杀意念（自杀在十至十四岁儿童中的死亡人数在2007年至2017年间增加了[两倍以上](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2022/04/11/the-mystifying-rise-of-child-suicide)）。他们对曾经象征自由的事物更加警惕或者兴趣减退：如饮酒、约会、性行为、获得驾照、搬出父母家。
- en: '“On average,” the social psychologist and N.Y.U. professor Jonathan Haidt writes
    in “[The Anxious Generation: How the Great Rewiring of Childhood Is Causing an
    Epidemic of Mental Illness](https://www.amazon.com/Anxious-Generation-Rewiring-Childhood-Epidemic/dp/0593655036),”
    “people born in and after 1996 were different, psychologically, from those who
    had been born just a few years earlier.” From childhood, Haidt suggests, they
    suffer from a weak “psychological immune system—the ability of a child to handle,
    process, and get past frustrations, minor accidents, teasing, exclusion, perceived
    injustices, and normal conflicts without falling prey to hours or days of inner
    turmoil.” This immunosuppression persists into adolescence and beyond, fostering
    higher proportions of nervous, avoidant young adults.'

    Haidt认为，从童年开始，他们就遭受着“心理免疫系统”的弱化——这指的是一个孩子处理、消化并克服挫折、轻微事故、嘲笑、排斥、视为不公正和普通冲突的能力，而不会陷入内心的长时间或几天的骚动。”
    这种免疫抑制持续到青春期甚至更长时间，培养出更多神经过敏、回避的年轻成年人。'
- en: For Haidt, the explanation is partly cultural and partly technological. The
    oldest members of Gen Z were in middle school in 2009 and 2010, when Facebook
    added the Like button, Twitter added the Retweet option, and smartphones’ front-facing
    cameras became ubiquitous, launching the age of the selfie. The effect of these
    tools, Haidt writes, was to attach kids to “a firehose of social comparison” that
    pummelled their self-esteem at a critical moment of cognitive and psychological
    development. Studies show that, the more kids use [social media](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/the-weekend-essay/coming-of-age-at-the-dawn-of-the-social-internet),
    the more likely they are to experience anxiety and depression; girls, Black children,
    and L.G.B.T.Q. youth are hit hardest. (Boys over all, hypnotized by porn and video
    games, don’t fare hugely better than girls.) And constant discussion and self-diagnosis
    of mental-health disorders on TikTok, Instagram, and elsewhere may contribute
    to what two University of Oxford researchers call “[prevalence inflation](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0732118X2300003X),”
    in which people mistake everyday stress and discomfort as signs of a serious disorder
    “in a way that is ultimately self-fulfilling.” As an example, the scholars note
    that “interpreting low levels of anxiety as symptomatic of an anxiety disorder
    might lead to behavioural avoidance, which can further exacerbate anxiety symptoms.”

  zh: 对于海德特来说，部分文化和部分技术原因解释了这一现象。Z 世代的最年长成员在 2009 年和 2010 年上中学时，Facebook 添加了“赞”按钮，Twitter
    添加了“转发”选项，智能手机的前置摄像头变得无处不在，开启了自拍的时代。海德特写道，这些工具的影响是把孩子们紧密联系到一个“社交比较的消防水龙头”，在他们认知和心理发展的关键时期打击了他们的自尊心。研究表明，孩子们使用[社交媒体](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/the-weekend-essay/coming-of-age-at-the-dawn-of-the-social-internet)越多，他们经历焦虑和抑郁的可能性就越大；女孩、黑人儿童和
    LGBTQ 青少年受到的影响最严重。（总体来看，被色情和视频游戏迷住的男孩的状况也不比女孩好到哪里去。）在 TikTok、Instagram 和其他平台上持续讨论和自诊断心理健康问题可能会导致牛津大学两位研究人员所称的“[患病率膨胀](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0732118X2300003X)”，即人们错误地把日常压力和不适当作严重疾病的迹象，“这种误解最终会自我实现”。学者们举例说，“把低级别焦虑解读为焦虑症状可能导致行为回避，进而进一步加剧焦虑症状”。
- en: By the time that smartphones and social media were becoming omnipresent, in
    the late two-thousands and early twenty-tens, children were also spending less
    and less time engaged in unstructured, largely unsupervised play with their peers.
    This deprivation owed to their parents’ concerns for their safety—a fretfulness
    known as “safetyism”—and to a competitive, college-fixated mind-set that prioritized
    adult-led, résumé-building, and “enrichment” activities. Unaccompanied kids doing
    normal kid things like walking home from school or visiting a playground became
    conspicuous, strange, perhaps even the subject of a 911 call or a C.P.S. investigation.

  zh: 当智能手机和社交媒体在二千年代末和二十年代初变得无所不在时，孩子们也越来越少参与与同龄人的非结构化、大部分无监督的游戏。这种剥夺是因为父母担心他们的安全——一种被称为“安全主义”的忧虑——以及竞争激烈、以大学为中心的心态，这种心态优先考虑成人主导的、履历建设和“丰富化”活动。像独自从学校步行回家或者去游乐场玩耍这样正常的孩子行为变得引人注目、奇怪，甚至可能成为报警或社会福利署调查的主题。在乡村或小镇上，一个九岁的孩子，一代人前，会和邻居孩子们整个下午在外面跑来跑去，现在却躲在室内盯着手机。

    [文章](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2015/09/the-coddling-of-the-american-mind/399356/)，标题为“美国心灵的娇养”。在那篇文章中，以及同名的[2018年的书](https://www.amazon.com/Coddling-American-Mind-Intentions-Generation/dp/0735224897)中，海特和卢基亚诺夫描绘了一个被“包裹泡沫”的一代，他们被培养得“脆弱、焦虑且容易受伤”，并猛烈抨击了他们认为是由学生主导的“试图将校园清理干净，避免引起不适或冒犯的词语、思想和主题”的运动。根据作者的说法，腐蚀性的清洁剂包括触发警告、毫无根据的“微侵犯”谈话和对“安全空间”的要求。海特和卢基亚诺夫认为，安全主义的Gen

    title promised, but Haidt and Lukianoff’s reflexive disdain for left-leaning youth
    and weakness for caricature had a flattening effect on their analysis. Haidt had
    risen to public-intellectual fame in the early two-thousands via his work on positive
    psychology, but “Coddling” turned him into a folk hero in a frequently specious
    war against cancel culture, winning him fans among the revanchist likes of Joe
    Rogan, [Bari Weiss](https://www.newyorker.com/news/annals-of-activism/is-it-possible-to-be-both-moderate-and-anti-woke),
    and Jordan Peterson. He has often taken a both-sides approach to political conflict
    that equates leftist activism with deadly right-wing extremism. (A section in
    “Coddling” that deals with the 2017 “Unite the Right” rally of white supremacists
    and the counter-demonstrators it drew, in Charlottesville, is an especially egregious
    example of this tendency.) He has been [beset](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBNtOCCSSRc)

    ubiquitous and indispensable as backpacks and sneakers. Several parents said that
    they weren’t sure how to balance preserving their children’s privacy—their ability
    to have a sacred space carved out from their parents to grow into themselves—and
    monitoring their online and offline behavior in order to keep them safe. One told

    media simultaneously fills and widens that emptiness. Although online forums can
    provide some of the togetherness that young people crave, ideally, Haidt writes,
    most of their interactions should unfold in person, unmediated by screens, which
    requires emotional effort and investment. In reading “The Anxious Generation”
    and speaking with parents, I frequently thought about what the late literary and
    cultural theorist [Lauren Berlant](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/03/25/affect-theory-and-the-new-age-of-anxiety)
    called “the inconvenience of other people”—the “affective sense of the familiar
    friction of being in relation. At a minimum, inconvenience is the force that makes
    one shift a little while processing the world.” Using your mind and body to interact
    extemporaneously with other minds and bodies is a skill that dulled during the
    pandemic; it can be boring, or frustrating, or distressing; it demands time, compromise,
    and accommodation. The inconvenient person, Berlant wrote, is “someone you trip
    over, even just in your mind.” Kids need to trip over people and ideas, at the
    risk of scraping up their psyches, in order to learn how to move through the world
    and how to connect meaningfully with the people in it.

    abstain from social media for a while, their mental health improves even as their
    isolation from their friends who are still on the platforms increases; a smart,
    emotionally intelligent kid can recognize the merits of this trade-off and still
    choose to keep their TikTok and Snapchat accounts. (A University of Chicago [working
