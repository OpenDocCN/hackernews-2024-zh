- en: AROUND 650 BCE, on the eastern shore of the **Aegean Sea**, coinage was invented.
    Very soon afterward, ancient counterfeiters and their counterfeit coinage appeared,
    and it has been with us ever since. Counterfeiting has been called the world’s
    “second oldest profession”^([1]).

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The first method used by ancient counterfeiters was to cover a base metal core
    with a thin layer of precious metal and then strike it between engraved dies.
    If the coating was seamless, the dies of good quality, and the weight of the finished
    piece close enough to the official standard, such coins might pass as genuine.
    They are known as **fourées**, from a French word meaning “stuffed”.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A second method used by ancient counterfeiters was to make **clay molds** from
    an original coin, and then pour molten metal into the molds, usually leaded copper
    alloy. Ceramic molds could be mass-produced cheaply, so low-value copper coins
    could be counterfeited profitably. There was a chronic shortage of small change
    in ancient economies, so even poor quality fakes were accepted in markets for
    lack of anything better. Authorities tended to ignore such forgeries, even when
    they enforced [savage penalties](https://coinweek.com/ancient-coins/damnatio-ad-bestias-happened-roman-counterfeiters/)
    against counterfeiting precious metal coins.

    the introduction of coins.

    of gold and silver) with faint ridges (“striations”) on one side and rough punch
    marks on the other. Amazingly, there are counterfeits of even these primitive
    pieces.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Some fourées of tiny early electrum coins^([2]) were struck with the very same
    dies used to produce official issues. This has been taken as “proof” that mints
    simultaneously produced genuine and “counterfeit” (official fake?) coins. Perhaps
    the ruler’s need for cash exceeded the supply of precious metal. Other interpretations
    are possible; perhaps these dies were stolen or “borrowed” by moonlighting mint
    workers and Ancient Counterfeiters.

    **tetradrachms** bearing a *quadriga* (four-horse chariot) on the obverse and
    the head of **Arethusa**^([3]) encircled by four swimming dolphins on the reverse.

    standard (an “Attic” or Athenian tetradrachm was supposed to weigh 17.24 grams),
    and perhaps make test cuts on the edge with a small chisel to see if there was
    a plated core.

    collectors. Some counterfeit owls, even with noticeably deficient weight, managed

    in a recent auction^([6]).

    the economy gradually recovered, and by 393 BCE Athenians could exchange their
    emergency coins for good silver.

    methods for covering a base metal surface with thin layers of precious metal(s).
    The aim of both the legitimate artisan and the counterfeiter was to find a technology
    which permitted the minimum use of precious metal, while at the same time ensuring
    that their layers adhered as closely as possible to the base core to provide resistance
    to wear over long periods of use* (Gadzac, 126).'

    of butter) with gold or silver. This was smeared evenly over the surface of the
    base metal core, which was then heated in a furnace to drive off the mercury as
    a vapor, leaving the precious metal firmly bound to the surface. An example is
    a gold plated *quinarius*^([12]) of **Augustus**, described by the cataloguer
    as “amusing,” that sold for $254 in a recent auction^([13]).

    similar grade would have cost. The weight (2.12g) is a bit short of the 2.25g
    standard, and the base metal core shows through the gold on the edge – perhaps
    where it was filed or clipped in antiquity.
