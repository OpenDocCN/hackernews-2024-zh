- en: Lewis L. Strauss was once a very important man in Washington. An admiral who
    helped run the Navy’s weapons efforts in the 1940s. The chairman of America’s
    atomic energy commission in the 1950s. Confidant and friend of President Dwight
    D. Eisenhower — so close that when Eisenhower left the White House in January
    1961, his first stop was a lunch hosted by Strauss.
