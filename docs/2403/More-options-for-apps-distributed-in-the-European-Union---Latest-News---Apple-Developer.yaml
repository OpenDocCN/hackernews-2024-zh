    authorized developers distribute their iOS apps to EU users directly from a website
    owned by the developer. Apple will provide authorized developers access to APIs
    that facilitate the distribution of their apps from the web, integrate with system
    functionality, back up and restore users’ apps, and more. For details, visit [Getting
    ready for Web Distribution in the EU](https://developer.apple.com/support/web-distribution-eu/).
