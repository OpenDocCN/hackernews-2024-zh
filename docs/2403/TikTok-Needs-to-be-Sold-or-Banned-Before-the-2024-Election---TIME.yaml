    [which has over 170 million monthly active users in the U.S.](https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/opening-statement-senate-judiciary-committee-hearing)—more
    than half the total U.S. population of any age—is owned by a Chinese company,
    ByteDance. We need to take that very seriously, not only because TikTok is generally
    influential with young Americans, but because we’ve already seen it drive political
    sentiment, especially on college campuses.

    ties with Bytedance. This article makes the case for that legislation and why
    it’s so critical to the future of American democracy.

    those of other major social media platforms. This is likely because TikTok shows
    a higher concentration of pro-Palestinian content, but could also be because TikTok
    amplifies more sensationalist content. Unlike Instagram and X, where content reach
    is influenced by an account's established follower count accumulated over years,
    TikTok allows even new users to achieve widespread visibility if their posts receive
    above-average engagement.

    is owned by American investors. However, ByteDance’s other main asset, Douyin
    (China’s TikTok), operates at the pleasure of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).
    As Didi Global and Ant Financial both discovered, the CCP is increasingly flexing
    its power to identify “regulatory violations” and “competition concerns” to assert
    its agenda. For Douyin to remain in the CCP’s good graces, TikTok may be required
    to do the CCP’s bidding.
