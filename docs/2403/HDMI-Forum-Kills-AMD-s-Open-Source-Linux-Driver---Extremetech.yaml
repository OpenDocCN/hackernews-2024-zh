- en: The HDMI standard is essentially ubiquitous more than 20 years after its debut.
    It's so common that it can be easy to forget that it's a proprietary standard—which
    can be a problem for fans of free open source software. AMD has been hoping to
    give a gift to the [Linux faithful](https://www.extremetech.com/computing/developer-touts-the-benefits-of-diagonal-mode-linux-desktop)
    in the form of an open source HDMI driver, but that quest appears to be ending.
    The HDMI Forum has reportedly rejected AMD's legal justification, forcing it to
    keep the driver under wraps.

- en: The HDMI Forum was set up in 2002 by companies like Sony, Panasonic, and Maxell,
    but it now has nearly 100 members. The Forum's job is to oversee the development
    and licensing of the HDMI standard, and it doesn't allow open access to the technology.
    That has been a thorn in the side of the most demanding Linux desktop users. If
    you want to drive a 4K or 5K monitor at high refresh rates over HDMI, you're out
    of luck.

- en: AMD, a long-time member of the Forum, has been working on an open source version
    of the [HDMI 2.1 specification](https://www.extremetech.com/extreme/329749-hdmi-2-1-devices-are-not-required-to-support-any-new-hdmi-2-1-features)
    since last year. That's when AMD developer Alex Deucher announced that AMD's legal
    team was working to determine what features the company could deliver without
    running afoul of its obligations to the Forum. With such a driver, AMD's open
    FreeSync standard could work over HDMI with high resolution and refresh.

- en: As of late 2023, AMD had submitted its request to the HDMI Forum and was waiting
    for a decision. Deucher has [posted an update](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/drm/amd/-/issues/1417#note_2303163)
    on an issue tracker thread he's kept open for three years, and it's bad news.
    The Forum has rejected AMD's request, and Deucher does not believe there's a way
    to release the open HDMI 2.1 driver without getting AMD in hot water. The thread
    has attracted dozens of new replies from disappointed Linux users decrying the
    Forum's stubbornness.

- en: Precisely what rules AMD would breach if it released the driver is unclear.
    [According](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/02/hdmi-forum-to-amd-no-you-cant-make-an-open-source-hdmi-2-1-driver/)
    to Ars Technica, Forum members pay a $15,000 annual fee, but none of the publicly
    available documentation strictly forbids creating an open version of the specification.
    However, the HDMI Forum's source code license is rather restrictive. Some commenters
    in the issue tracker have speculated that the Forum could be concerned about ripping
    protected video streams. Still, digital pirates hardly need an open HDMI driver
    to rip video content.

    DisplayPort is a newer standard with better output support on Linux. AMD could
    implement new HDMI features in closed source drivers or binary blobs, but Deucher
    has not said how or if the project will move forward.
