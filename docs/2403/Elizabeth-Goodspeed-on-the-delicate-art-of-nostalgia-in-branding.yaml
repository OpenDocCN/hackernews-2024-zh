- en: 'And while my personal taste ([tackled last time](https://www.itsnicethat.com/articles/elizabeth-goodspeed-column-taste-technology-art-280224)!)
    leans towards the historic, consumer behaviour also suggests a broader predilection
    towards heritage and the perceived authenticity it affords, even when that heritage
    isn’t attached to a superior aesthetic. In fact, public preferences often lean
    towards traditional or seemingly “worse” designs, so long as they’re backed by
    an appropriate connection to nostalgia. One notable example is the recent rebrand
    of Bahlsen, a renowned German biscuit manufacturer. In 2021, [Bahlsen’s redesign](https://thedieline.com/blog/2021/9/2/bahlsen)
    was acclaimed by the design community for its clean, bold modernity (even winning
    them a D&AD award). Nonetheless, the rebrand resulted in a [12% drop in sales](https://twitter.com/ruskamartin/status/1709166904110092504)
    the following year. This decline was attributed to a variety of factors: low on-shelf
    recognition, reduced emotional resonance, and smaller, less appetising photos
    than the original, “dated” packaging. In other words, even if the branding was
    good, it didn’t feel right.'

    commercial art like posters or magazines, seems to run deep. I think this is because
    packaging is the set dressing of daily life; it’s the diaper box seen in the corner
    of a baby photo, the perfume vial on your older sister’s dresser, or the [expired
    ketchup bottle](https://www.today.com/food/trends/mom-goes-viral-for-reaction-to-kids-annual-refrigerator-purge-rcna127425)
    lingering in the back of your parent’s fridge. Like Proust’s Madeleine, these
    branded items, often unnoticed in the moment, become imbued with nostalgia in
    retrospect, evoking profound feelings of comfort and recognition upon sight. This
    emotional potency makes packaging a powerful tool for brands. By maintaining or
    reverting to heritage designs, brands can tap into a reservoir of collective subconscious,
    triggering involuntary memories that foster a profound emotional connection. Nostalgia
    doesn’t just evoke fond memories either: it also creates a sense of trust and
    safety, as evidenced in the sharp [increase](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/28/smarter-living/coronavirus-nostalgia.html)
    in nostalgic content during the height of the pandemic.'
