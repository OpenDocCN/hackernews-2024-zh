    over the past few days, you were probably greeted by a popup that mentioned a
    new user agreement. While that's not uncommon, what's unusual is that there was
    no way to close it out or disregard it.

    is to agree. Pressing the back or home buttons do nothing to make the popup go
    away; if you turn off the TV, it's there again when you power back on. Several
    users reported that they couldn't even use HDMI inputs while the warning was in
    place.

- en: The new agreement specifically relates to dispute resolution with Roku, or how
    problems severe enough to involve the legal system are handled. By agreeing to
    these new terms, two changes are made. First, any legal complaints will be handled
    through arbitration instead of involving the court system. Second, complaints
    must be handled through a phone call or in person with Roku legal representation
    before even reaching arbitration.

    it's worth pointing out that plenty of major companies have a similar policy about
    legal action. You agreed to the same thing if you use Facebook or Reddit, for
    example. It's also not new for terms to be updated after a product is purchased,
    as virtually every smart home product updates theirs from time to time.

    agree or stop using your TV.

    but it involves writing down your name, address, phone number, email address used
    for your Roku account, device model number, a receipt if you have it, and mailing
    Roku's general counsel in California -- and doing do within 30 days.
