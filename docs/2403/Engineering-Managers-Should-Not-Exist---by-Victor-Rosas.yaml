    successes and failures carefully and use those insights to mold the product. They
    communicate the customer needs and their vision to the team effectively so they
    know what they’re building and why. They are professional *problem givers*. Then
    they hand off those problems to the professional *problem solvers*: the engineers.
    That’s how products are shipped and companies are built and profits are had. Everything
    else is just noise.'

    where the bodies are buried. They can write and deploy code quickly. They know
    when to pay attention to detail and when to take shortcuts. They can see the big
    problem and make it into smaller problems for the team to solve themselves. They
    do the *work*. Without them, the product/project/engineering managers would just
    be shouting into the void.

    for another time. But in theory they break down the vision of the product manager
    into discrete chunks of work and track that. Kind of a choose-your-own-adventure
    in how to micromanage everyone’s time but they seem to stay busy for the most
    part.

    where they can be outstanding in any of those capacities. There simply aren’t
    enough hours in the day. They’ll try, but these tasks should be given to those
    who specialize in those areas.

    up. They get really into Jira. They talk a lot about process. They somehow inject
    themselves into meetings they don’t belong in. You know the enterprising sort.
    Eventually their manager looks at them and says “Wow you have management potential!”
    because that’s exactly how they themselves got into that role. And thus the cycle
    continues. *Actually good* engineers never really stop being engineers.

- en: 'The lowest level engineering manager has more power than the highest level
    engineer. If a junior dev is told to do **A** by a principal engineer and **B**
    by their manager, they’re going to do **B** every time. The reason is simple:
    money. Managers control their team’s salaries. They handle promo packets. They
    can decide to fire you. The principal engineer might have opinions about those
    things, but usually nobody listens to them that intently. Their voice on a promotion
    panel might have sway, but it won’t matter if the junior engineer’s packet is
    never submitted in the first place. Go against your manager and you’re no longer
    a team player. You need an attitude adjustment. You’re on your way to a PIP. Have
    fun.'

  zh: 最低级别的工程经理比最高级别的工程师更有权力。如果初级开发人员被首席工程师告知做**A**，而被他们的经理告知做**B**，他们每次都会选择做**B**。原因很简单：钱。经理控制他们团队的工资。他们处理晋升申请。他们可以决定是否解雇你。虽然首席工程师可能对这些事情有意见，但通常没有人那么认真听取他们的意见。他们在晋升评审委员会上的声音可能会有影响，但如果初级工程师的晋升申请从未提交，那就没有什么意义了。反对你的经理，你就不再是一个团队合作者。你需要调整态度。你正在走向绩效改进计划。玩得开心吧。

    don’t try and fix any of it ourselves or let our reports work it out amongst themselves.
    Straight to *real* HR so they can deal with it, blow it out of proportion, and
    eventually ruin at least one of the engineer’s careers at the company.

- en: When we’re not doing that we’re talking to the team about their careers, pretending
    this isn’t a cash-for-keystrokes business. We’re trying to convince the team they
    love working here. They should work harder for no more money, in fact. Possibly
    zero money if they don’t work hard enough. *Maybe a little* more money if they’re
    good and we feel like taking the effort to go through the byzantine process of
    actually getting them promoted. That’s a lot of work though… maybe next promo
    cycle. Here have some pizza.

    over them? Their job. It’s almost comical. Oh the sigh of relief when a bad manager
    goes on an extended vacation. People can finally focus. Everyone relaxes. They
    can speak freely again. Productivity shoots up. And then when they come back…
    ugh. Some of the most productive teams I’ve seen effectively had no engineering
    manager, usually because theirs left and the team consequently reported to some
    absurdly high-level executive who couldn’t give a damn what they’re up to. **I
    like how they do it in consulting**

    唉。我见过的一些最高效的团队实际上没有工程经理，通常是因为他们的经理离职了，团队因此开始向某位完全不关心他们在做什么的高级执行官汇报。**我喜欢咨询公司的做法**

    as your advocate for as long as you’re both working there. They’re a long term
    friend whose job it is to make you successful within the company as a whole. They
    don’t work with you personally but will find evidence (from your project leads)
    to promote you. Just as importantly, they can be a neutral voice if the project
    or your relationship with the lead isn’t going swimmingly. I like this division

  zh: 然后你有一个职业教练。他们是公司内的另一位人员，负责在你们共同工作期间为你辩护。他们是一位长期的朋友，其工作是使你在整个公司中取得成功。他们不会直接与你合作，但会从你的项目负责人那里找到证据来推广你。同样重要的是，如果项目或你与负责人的关系并不顺利，他们可以作为一个中立的声音。我喜欢这种职责的分工。
