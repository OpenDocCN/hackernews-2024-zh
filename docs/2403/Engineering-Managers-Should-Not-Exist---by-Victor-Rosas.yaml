    the team. They are a visionary. They speak for the customers. They measure their
    successes and failures carefully and use those insights to mold the product. They
    communicate the customer needs and their vision to the team effectively so they
    know what they’re building and why. They are professional *problem givers*. Then
    they hand off those problems to the professional *problem solvers*: the engineers.
    That’s how products are shipped and companies are built and profits are had. Everything
    else is just noise.'

    where the bodies are buried. They can write and deploy code quickly. They know
    when to pay attention to detail and when to take shortcuts. They can see the big
    problem and make it into smaller problems for the team to solve themselves. They
    do the *work*. Without them, the product/project/engineering managers would just
    be shouting into the void.

- en: Project managers… I have a lot of thoughts around the state of project management
    for another time. But in theory they break down the vision of the product manager
    into discrete chunks of work and track that. Kind of a choose-your-own-adventure
    in how to micromanage everyone’s time but they seem to stay busy for the most
    part.

    where they can be outstanding in any of those capacities. There simply aren’t
    enough hours in the day. They’ll try, but these tasks should be given to those
    who specialize in those areas.

    up. They get really into Jira. They talk a lot about process. They somehow inject
    themselves into meetings they don’t belong in. You know the enterprising sort.
    Eventually their manager looks at them and says “Wow you have management potential!”
    because that’s exactly how they themselves got into that role. And thus the cycle
    continues. *Actually good* engineers never really stop being engineers.

    was a little more windy, but I did have to spend a considerable amount of time
    pretending to like doing those non-engineering things to convince the powers that
    be that I was, in fact, just like them. I’m sure I was a better engineer than
    I am a manager but here we are.*'

    engineer. If a junior dev is told to do **A** by a principal engineer and **B**
    by their manager, they’re going to do **B** every time. The reason is simple:
    money. Managers control their team’s salaries. They handle promo packets. They
    can decide to fire you. The principal engineer might have opinions about those
    things, but usually nobody listens to them that intently. Their voice on a promotion
    panel might have sway, but it won’t matter if the junior engineer’s packet is
    never submitted in the first place. Go against your manager and you’re no longer
    a team player. You need an attitude adjustment. You’re on your way to a PIP. Have
    fun.'

    don’t try and fix any of it ourselves or let our reports work it out amongst themselves.
    Straight to *real* HR so they can deal with it, blow it out of proportion, and
    eventually ruin at least one of the engineer’s careers at the company.

    this isn’t a cash-for-keystrokes business. We’re trying to convince the team they
    love working here. They should work harder for no more money, in fact. Possibly
    zero money if they don’t work hard enough. *Maybe a little* more money if they’re
    good and we feel like taking the effort to go through the byzantine process of
    actually getting them promoted. That’s a lot of work though… maybe next promo
    cycle. Here have some pizza.

    over them? Their job. It’s almost comical. Oh the sigh of relief when a bad manager
    goes on an extended vacation. People can finally focus. Everyone relaxes. They
    can speak freely again. Productivity shoots up. And then when they come back…
    ugh. Some of the most productive teams I’ve seen effectively had no engineering
    manager, usually because theirs left and the team consequently reported to some
    absurdly high-level executive who couldn’t give a damn what they’re up to. **I
    like how they do it in consulting**

    lasts. They handle your day-in and day-out tasks. They act as the product manager
    and you work for them.

    as your advocate for as long as you’re both working there. They’re a long term
    friend whose job it is to make you successful within the company as a whole. They
    don’t work with you personally but will find evidence (from your project leads)
    to promote you. Just as importantly, they can be a neutral voice if the project
    or your relationship with the lead isn’t going swimmingly. I like this division
    of duties.
