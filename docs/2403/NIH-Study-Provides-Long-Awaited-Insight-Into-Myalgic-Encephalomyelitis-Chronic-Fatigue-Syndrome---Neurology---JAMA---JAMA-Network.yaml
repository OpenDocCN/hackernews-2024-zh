    syndrome, or ME/CFS, has had a legitimacy deficit for decades. Now, a team of
    75 multidisciplinary scientists and clinicians from across the National Institutes
    of Health (NIH) and collaborators have completed an extensive inpatient [study](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-45107-3)
    of a carefully selected group of people with postinfectious ME/CFS, published
    in *Nature Communications*.
