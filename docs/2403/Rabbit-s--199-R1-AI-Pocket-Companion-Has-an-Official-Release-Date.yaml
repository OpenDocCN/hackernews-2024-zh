- en: The AI gadget that stole [CES 2024](https://www.inverse.com/ces-2024) finally
    has a release date. I’m, of course, talking about the [Rabbit R1, the real-life
    Pokédex-like pocket device](https://www.inverse.com/tech/rabbit-r1-ai-release-date-price-ces-2024)
    that uses AI, a camera, and microphones to “see” and “hear.”

    units of the Teenage Engineering-designed device will start rolling off factory
    lines on March 31, with the first batch of deliveries [arriving starting on April
    24](https://twitter.com/rabbit_hmi/status/1771343600519139337). The company has
    a [“pickup party”](https://x.com/jessechenglyu/status/1771357834015625441?s=20)
    in New York City on April 23.

- en: At $199 and with no subscription required, the R1 is the first breakout hit
    for this new wave of “AI gadgets” that include the [Humane Ai Pin](https://www.inverse.com/tech/humane-ai-pin-subscription-three-months-free)
    and the recently announced [Open Interpreter 01 Light](https://www.inverse.com/tech/open-interpreter-01-light-ai-control-your-computer-for-you).
    These devices tout their built-in AI assistants as ways to help contextualize
    the world, as a sort of second brain or extension to the mind, and/or to automate
    app or service experiences by learning how to operate them for you.

    a device and startup with no proven track record, the interest is remarkable.

- en: In contrast, Humane hasn’t shared sales numbers for the Ai Pin. Its $700 price
    tag and $24/month subscription (though, the first three months are free if you
    purchase the device by March 31) makes it a tougher sell. A day after Open Interpreter
    announced its 01 Light ($99 pre-made or you can build your own with the open-source
    documentation), the company said [it received 1,000 pre-orders](https://x.com/hellokillian/status/1771647508516880546?s=20).

- en: The upcoming Rabbit R1 release and Humane Ai Pin release can be thought of as
    the return of The Gadget. The iPhone was revolutionary and transformed the world
    in significant ways; it also made smartphones a multi-tool that replaced separate
    devices like a phone, music player, digital camera, and more. But with AI, standalone
    gadgets that leverage AI to understand the world around you are getting their
    moment.

    The answer is actually really simple: phones and tablets don’t allow AI deep system-level
    access. The iPhone, especially, is a closed platform that Apple wouldn’t allow
    AI complete access to. Josh Miller, the CEO of The Browser Company, which makes
    the fantastic Arc web browser for Mac (and Windows in beta) and AI-powered Arc
    Search mobile browser, put it perfectly on Sunday:'

  zh: 很多人一直在问：为什么这些人工智能设备不能只是一个应用程序？答案实际上非常简单：手机和平板电脑不允许人工智能在深层系统级别上获得访问权限。尤其是 iPhone，作为一个封闭平台，Apple
    不会允许人工智能完全访问权限。周日，Josh Miller，The Browser Company 的 CEO，这家公司制作了令人惊叹的 Mac（和 beta
    版 Windows）平台上的 Arc web 浏览器和 AI 驱动的 Arc Search 移动浏览器，他对此有了很好的解释：

- en: I have no doubt that Google and Samsung and Apple are racing to incorporate
    AI at a system level into their smartphones, and the results could very much render
    the Rabbit R1 or Humane Ai Pin obsolete. Google and Samsung have already [opened
    the AI floodgates](https://www.inverse.com/tech/samsung-galaxy-s24-ai-features-google-explained)
    on the [Pixel 8 series](https://www.inverse.com/tech/google-pixel-8-phone-assistant-with-bard-generative-ai)
    and [Galaxy S24 series](https://www.inverse.com/tech/samsung-galaxy-s24-phones-generative-ai),
    respectively. Still, it’s refreshing to see the new form factors and designs.
    Smartphones (slabs or foldables) are here to stay for a long time, but they’ve
    been the center of our lives for 17 years. There has to be room for other devices
    to fit in. We’re about to find out whether these new AI gadgets can break through
    the smartphone chokehold or if they’ll be short-lived gimmicks. Buckle up, tech
    is about to get fun and exciting again!

  zh: 我毫不怀疑，Google、Samsung 和 Apple 正在竞相将人工智能系统级别地整合到他们的智能手机中，其结果可能会大大使得 Rabbit R1
    或 Humane Ai Pin 过时。Google 和 Samsung 分别已经在他们的智能手机 [Pixel 8 系列](https://www.inverse.com/tech/google-pixel-8-phone-assistant-with-bard-generative-ai)

    17 年。必须有空间容纳其他设备。我们即将发现这些新型人工智能设备能否突破智能手机的垄断地位，还是它们只是昙花一现的噱头。准备好，科技即将再次变得有趣和激动人心！
