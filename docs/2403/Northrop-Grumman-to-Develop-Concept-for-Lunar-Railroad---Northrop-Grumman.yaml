    NOC) has been selected by DARPA to further develop the concept of building a moon-based
    railroad network as part of the broader [10-year Lunar Architecture (LunA-10)
    Capability Study](https://www.darpa.mil/news-events/2023-08-15). The envisioned
    lunar railroad network could transport humans, supplies and resources for commercial
    ventures across the lunar surface – contributing to a space economy for the United
    States and international partners.'
