    founders about dealing with large platform companies like Meta, Google, Amazon,
    and Apple. Depending on your business, working with these platforms ranges from
    ‚Äúconvenient‚Äù to ‚Äúexistentially necessary‚Äù.

    making it a great fit for Instagram. Our potential customers are on Instagram
    and Facebook, so we really have to be there too. In fact, since launch, we‚Äôve
    paid Meta literal millions of dollars for advertising on these platforms.

    we figured things would be fine ‚Äî and they more or less have been. Ad performance
    has declined a bit, but hasn‚Äôt it for everyone? It also bothered me that we‚Äôve
    never been assigned an account manager or given a phone number to call for issues,
    but that seems to be an extremely standard experience as well.

    not rocket science, you just click ‚ÄúPay‚Äù in their billing portal and enter your
    credit card. It gets charged.

    was charged, the invoice state updated to ‚ÄúProcessing‚Äù. Strangely, the portal

    charged, and the charge had even been finalized. We responded with a screenshot
    of the Amex statement and once again figured that was it.

    it became pretty clear that the collections analyst didn‚Äôt even realize that credit
    card payments were possible. They asked for things like an *‚ÄúMT103 document‚Äù*
    and *‚Äúpayment advise document‚Äù*. Those are the kinds of receipts you get when
    you send a wire transfer from a bank, but obviously we didn‚Äôt have them since
    I paid via credit card through Meta‚Äôs own website.

    from the analyst to call us by phone (they never did), and a new response from

    credit card bill with Amex.

    support. I did that, and the chat support rep was clearly not able to deal with
    this kind of issue. The rep gave me a link and asked me to fill out a support
    form to reach support‚Ä¶ but it was the exact same form I‚Äôd just filled out to start
    a chat with *them*.

    the bug report, but those reports clearly state ‚Äúwe¬†can't personally¬†respond to

    without an Instagram presence‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs kind of like trying to build a consumer phone
