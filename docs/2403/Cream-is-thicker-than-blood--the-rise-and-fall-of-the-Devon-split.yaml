    relationship between Devon and its clotted cream, and how the development of the
    British railways brought ‘railway milk’ from the county to London, changing its
    relationship to the capital. Max’s essay also looks at Devon’s beloved cream-filled,
    jam-studded split, which, although past its glory-days, is possibly due a resurgence.

    of Devon’s food culture: James Caird wrote in his book *English Agriculture in
    1850–1851* that Devon was ‘justly celebrated for dairy management’, while in 1932,
    the food writer Florence White observed schoolchildren in Tiverton ‘trickl[ing]
    golden syrup over substantial slices of bread and cream which they called “thunder
    and lightning”’. Today the county’s dairy production is the UK’s third-largest,
    accounting for 7.5% of the nation’s milk delivery, and the small number of dishes
    considered to be Devonian often involve dairy, like junket topped with clotted
    cream, Devonian cream tea, and the Devon (or Devonshire) split: a sweetened bun
    filled with whipped cream and topped with a dot of strawberry jam (also known
    as a ‘cut-round’ in North Devon, a ‘chudleigh’ east of Exeter, and a ‘tuff bun’
    in the south-west).'

    cows, which until this point, had served the city’s dairy needs. The cattle were
    an economy in their own right, and nothing went to waste: their sinews were melted
    for glue, carcasses butchered for meat, skins sent to Bermondsey’s massive tanneries,
    and their bones ground to dust for manure. Islington in particular was dominated
    by cattle; in his 1811 book about the area, J Nelson observed that ‘The milk is
    conveyed from the cow-house and sold, principally by robust Welsh girls and Irish
    women’. Even St James’s Park had a milkmaid until the early twentieth century.
    While other counties made their names in the capital by supplying perishable dairy
    goods like butter and cheese, the West Country remained somewhat insular.'

  zh: 19世纪末，伦敦拥有大约25,000头奶牛，直到这一时期，这些牛一直在为城市的奶制品需求提供服务。这些牛是一个经济体系，没有任何东西被浪费：它们的筋被熔化用作胶水，尸体被屠宰用作肉类，皮肤被送到伯蒙西的大型鞣革厂，它们的骨头被磨成粉用作肥料。伊斯灵顿特别以牛为主；在他1811年关于该地区的书中，J·尼尔森观察到，“牛奶是由牛舍搬运并出售的，主要由健壮的威尔士女孩和爱尔兰女人负责”。即使是圣詹姆斯公园在20世纪初也有牛奶女工。尽管其他县以供应像黄油和奶酪这样的易腐乳制品而闻名于首都，但西乡村仍然相对封闭。
- en: All that changed after the industrial revolution, when Devon’s cottage dairy
    industry could easily have been wiped out. Instead it flourished, becoming an
    essential part of London’s dairy supply chain. With the arrival of the railway
    from the capital in the mid-nineteenth century, perishable milk and butter could
    be transported from Devon’s dairies to London via the Great Western Railway (GWR).
    And this was a two-way revolution, as London’s Victorian elite could also be taken
    to a new corner of England to seek out its sea air. A circular economy based on
    the innovations of steam introduced steam separators to dairies in the 1880s;
    this industrialised the milk-production process and conveniently provided cream,
    which had been skimmed from the exportable milk. As a result, tourists were often
    refreshed with the ethereal yet indulgent Devon split.

  zh: 所有这一切都发生在工业革命之后，当时德文的小型奶制品产业本可以轻易被淘汰。相反，它蓬勃发展，并成为伦敦奶制品供应链的重要组成部分。随着19世纪中叶从首都到达的铁路的到来，易腐牛奶和黄油可以通过大西部铁路（GWR）从德文的奶制品到伦敦运输。这是一个双向革命，因为伦敦的维多利亚时代精英也可以去英格兰的一个新角落寻找海风。蒸汽革命的创新在1880年代将蒸汽分离器引入奶牛场，这使得乳制品生产过程工业化，并方便地提供了从可出口的牛奶中撇去的奶油。因此，游客们经常被那种飘渺而奢华的德文分割所刷新。
- en: London was utterly transformed by the flood of railway milk from Devon and other
    parts of Britain. The first instalment arrived at Liverpool Street Station in
    1845 – an order for ‘country milk’ for St Thomas’s Hospital from Romford, which
    was then a ‘rural’ town. During this time, George Barham – a businessman, and
    later Mayor of Hampstead – recognised a public desire for ‘cleaner’ rural produce,
    given the adulteration of city milk with dyes, chemical preservatives, and hot
    water (which gave the illusion that the milk was warm from the cow). Barham founded
    Express Dairies in 1864, pioneering the use of railway transport to bring rural
    milk supplies to the city centre. Owing to its proximity to large railway terminuses
    at Victoria and Paddington, West London was able to most quickly replace its intra-urban
    milk supply with railway milk. With urban dairies forced to meet increasingly
    rigorous tests for the cattle disease to which their herds were increasingly susceptible,
    railway milk came to dominate the market by the early twentieth century.

  zh: 伦敦在铁路从德文和其他英国地区运来的牛奶泛滥之后发生了彻底的变化。第一批货物于1845年抵达利物浦街站——从当时还是“乡村”小镇的罗姆福德为圣托马斯医院订购了“乡村牛奶”。在此期间，乔治·巴勒姆——一位商人，后来成为汉普斯特德市市长——意识到公众希望得到“更清洁”的乡村产品，鉴于城市牛奶被染料、化学防腐剂和热水（使牛奶看起来像从奶牛身上挤出来的一样）掺假的情况。巴勒姆于1864年创立了急件乳品公司，开创了使用铁路运输将乡村牛奶供应到市中心的先河。由于其毗邻维多利亚和帕丁顿大铁路站，西伦敦能够最快地用铁路牛奶取代其城市内部的牛奶供应。随着城市乳品公司被迫越来越严格地检测其牛群日益易感的牛病，到了20世纪初，铁路牛奶成为市场的主导。

- en: Initially, milk churns were loaded into any freight carriage to transport railway
    milk, but the risk of contamination – and recognition of an opportunity for profit
    – meant that railway companies began to adjust their timetables, putting on better-quality
    rolling stock and scheduling ‘milk trains’. According to Durham University’s Prof
    Peter Atkins, the GWR had the biggest market share of this milk supply – about
    18% until the 1880s, rising to 30% by 1910\. They even opened a platform at Paddington
    in 1913 that was dedicated to railway milk. As the journey from the West Country
    to London was slashed from a sixteen-hour coach ride to a four-and-a-half-hour
    train journey, enterprising dairies sprung up, and rail depots were established
    at Cullompton and Seaton so that milk could be dispatched to sites like Walford’s
    Dairy in London. The Culm Valley Dairy Co even operated its own light railway
    so it could be connected to the GWR’s main line. In 1861, just 6% of London’s
    milk supply had arrived by rail, but this figure rose to 96% by 1914, when milk
    flowed to the capital from all over Britain.

  zh: 最初，牛奶桶被装载进任何货运车厢以运输铁路牛奶，但污染风险及利润机会的认识促使铁路公司开始调整他们的时刻表，投入更高质量的车辆，并安排“牛奶列车”。根据杜伦大学的彼得·阿特金斯教授，GWR（大西部铁路公司）在这种牛奶供应中市场份额最大，到1880年为18%，到1910年升至30%。他们甚至在1913年在帕丁顿开设了一个专门用于铁路牛奶的站台。从西部乡村到伦敦的旅程从16小时的马车行程缩短到4个半小时的火车行程，使得富有进取精神的牛奶厂如雨后春笋般涌现，铁路货运站点如库洛姆普顿和西顿也因此成立，以便牛奶能够发运至伦敦的沃尔福德乳品公司等地点。库姆河谷乳品公司甚至运营自己的轻轨，以便连接到GWR的主干线。1861年，仅有6%的伦敦牛奶供应通过铁路运输，但到1914年，这一数字升至96%，当时的牛奶从全英国流向首都。

    crowd. At the time, there was an increased awareness of wellbeing and leisure
    time; this culminated in the Holidays with Pay Act of 1938 and brought holidaymakers
    of all classes to the south coast (by 1930, 150,000 people a year went to Torquay
    alone). On the south coast, teahouses like Deller’s and Addison’s Royal Café and
    Creamery opened to service leisure seekers, as the population of the ‘English
    Riviera’ – a new term coined to make favourable comparisons to the more famous
    French equivalent – almost trebled. The Devon split was the weapon of choice for
    any high tea-goer; one advertisement for Fortt’s Lido Café in Torquay read ‘Famous
    Devon Splits (for our noted cream teas)’, while at Deller’s, ‘cream buns’ or ‘rolls’
    were advertised with almost all of the eighteen tea options (only two offered
    a scone). The heyday of the Devon split coincided with the county’s prominence
    as a tourist destination, as well as the time when ambitions for its dairies were
    most strong.

    Lido Café的广告上写着“著名的德文分割（为我们著名的奶油茶点）”，而在戴勒斯，几乎所有18种茶点选项中都推广“奶油面包”或“面包卷”（只有两种提供司康）。德文分割的鼎盛时期恰逢该县作为旅游目的地的突出时期，同时也是其奶酪业雄心勃勃的时期。
- en: 'The decline of the split occurred at the same time as the decline of the railways,
    and of railway milk from Devon, in the latter half of the twentieth century due
    to competition from road haulage and underfunding. The ornate art deco ruins of
    the Torrington Creamery, founded in the 1880s, are a forlorn reminder of the fickle
    market that pushed Devon’s dairy industry into anonymity: a 2011 study by Exeter
    University stated that ‘small dairy herds are vanishing’ in Devon. The same preoccupation
    with cleanliness that killed off London’s intra-urban milk supply in the 1800s
    eventually reached rural farms too, pushing them towards industrialisation. Now,
    milk from ‘smaller’ farms is purchased by processors, homogenised, and pasteurised
    at modern facilities run by Arla or Müller, and sold, with generic labelling,
    in supermarkets.'

    was curtailed by the rise of the scone, whose minimally worked and artificially
    leavened dough needed significantly less input than the yeasted, kneaded, and
    proved split. The split is a product of my grandmother’s Devon, when a milkman
    still came to the door with a milk cart and a great churn to fill the milk jugs.
    The family would set a pan of milk rich unhomogenised milk over a low heat until
    the cream ‘clotted’, and it would be stored in the larder in the wall, without
    refrigeration.

    was characteristic of Devon’s peculiar relationship to dairy. The product was
    not found in neighbouring counties like Somerset, Gloucestershire, and Wiltshire
    until the twentieth century; in these places, Prof Atkins states, cream was left
    in the milk to make their best cheeses. Devon’s long-standing tradition of clotted
    cream, therefore, resonates with a very Devonian obsession: this is a county that
    concocted not just one, but a whole menagerie of products with bread as the vessel
    and cream as the topping, like splits, sponges, and doughnuts.'

    At Teignmouth, at the end of the South Devon extension to the GWR, you can still
    just about guarantee a Devon split from The Wee Shoppe Bakery, an antiquated spot
    where the staff call you ‘darling’. When you select a split at the counter, the
    pinnied lady might tell you that she prefers a custard slice, but don’t be deterred
    from your path. The split is the full stop, the complete package – what my grandad

    maritozzo, an Italian cream bun that bears an unmistakable resemblance to the
    split. Personally, I resent the Italophiles who exalt them, and Oliver Costello,
    the co-owner of TOAD Bakery in south London – who, by his own admission, ‘loves
    beef and beefing’ – shares my resentment. When TOAD recently posted an Instagram
    photograph of their Devon splits, one popular Italian bakery commented a sloth
    emoji. Costello tells me he took this to mean that TOAD had been ‘slow to the
    game’. Costello recognises that a maritozzo has some inexplicable ‘algorithmic
    magic’ – which, since it is almost identical to the Devon split, bar the dot of
    jam (a simple quantitative improvement that renders the latter superior), helps
    the split’s case. But something about tasting the split at its point of origin
    makes it uncannily memorable, like recalling a forgotten childhood holiday – to
    the point that, upon tasting it, you might think (as I did), ‘How did I forget
    that?’

    承认马里托佐有某种莫名其妙的“算法魔力” —— 尽管与德文斯普利特几乎相同，只是少了一点果酱（这个简单的定量改进使得后者更为优越），这有助于德文斯普利特的地位。但在原产地品尝德文斯普利特时的某些特质，使得它异常难忘，如同回忆起被遗忘的童年假期

    Bakehouse in central London, hint at some fresh interest – perhaps from digressing
    maritozzo enthusiasts – for this timeless combination of yeasted bun and fresh

    its popularity. And whether it’s the internet, the A303, or the railways, Devon
