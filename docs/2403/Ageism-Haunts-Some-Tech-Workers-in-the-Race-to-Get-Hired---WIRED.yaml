- en: The US economy is showing remarkable health, but in the tech industry, layoffs
    [keep coming](https://www.wired.com/story/tech-layoffs-2024-amazon-google-discord-twitch/).
    For those out of work, finding a new position can become a full-time job. And
    in tech—a sector notoriously always looking for the next hot, new thing—some people
    whose days as fresh-faced coders are long gone say that having decades of experience
    can feel like a disadvantage.

- en: Ageism is a longtime problem in the tech industry. Database startup RelevantDB
    went viral in 2021 after it posted a job listing bragging, “[We hire old people](https://www.fastcompany.com/90669478/we-hire-old-people-job-posting-for-software-developer-sparks-a-viral-conversation-about-ageism-in-tech),”
    which played off industry stereotypes. In 2020, the US Equal Employment Opportunity
    Commission found that [IBM](https://www.propublica.org/article/the-u-s-equal-employment-opportunity-commission-confirms-a-pattern-of-age-discrimination-at-ibm)
    had engaged in age discrimination, pushing out older workers to make room for
    younger ones. (The company has [denied](https://newsroom.ibm.com/IBM-Chief-Human-Resources-Officer-Addresses-False-Claims-of-Systemic-Age-Discrimination)
    engaging in “systemic age discrimination.”)

    that shows an older woman unfamiliar with tech jargon saying her son sells invisible

    as out of touch. In response, Jim Habig, LinkedIn’s vice president of marketing,
    says: “This ad didn''t meet our goal to create experiences where all professionals
    feel welcomed and valued, and we are working to replace the spot.”'

- en: Ageism is “an open secret in the tech industry,” says Maureen Clough, host of
    [*It Gets Late Early*](https://www.itgetslateearly.com/), a podcast about aging
    in tech. Even when ageism isn’t as blatant as the IBM case, she says, it lurks
    behind common ideas in industry hiring, such as culture fit. “If you have a company
    that is predominantly young, white, and male, it’s going to be harder to get in
    there,” Clough says.

- en: Vern Six, a 58-year-old programmer, says he recently ran into explicit ageism
    on his job hunt. A recruiter told him that he wouldn’t be appealing to employers
    and opined that Six should be chief technology officer at this point in his career,
    not a software developer, Six says.

    about that encounter went viral, he created a [LinkedIn group](https://www.linkedin.com/groups/14418151/)
    for people to discuss ageism in tech. He says he has often thought his age might
    play a role in job hunting, but “this was the first time I’ve ever had anybody
    say it directly.”

- en: Industry and government data shows that US tech workers skew younger than the
    wider US workforce, but definitive data on differences in hiring patterns for
    older and younger tech workers has been hard to gather. That’s because so many
    more senior tech workers get jobs by networking or moving between companies where
    they know people rather than by cold applying, and that’s tricky to study and
    quantify, says Joanna Lahey, a professor of public policy at Texas A&M University
    who studies age discrimination.

- en: Older workers may be out of work for longer between jobs because they’re more
    likely to seek higher salaries or be selective, says Lahey. But if older workers
    are excluded from some positions because recruiters assume they wouldn’t take
    a lower offer or position or are perceived as not fitting into the company culture,
    that’s a problem, she says. “There are a lot of people who have a lot of skills
    who are unemployed longer than they ought to be. It’s a loss for them, and it’s
    a loss for society.”

- en: Tech companies have laid off more than 400,000 workers over the past two years,
    according to [Layoffs.fyi](https://layoffs.fyi/), which tracks job cuts in the
    industry. To older workers, the purge is both a reminder of the dotcom bust, and
    a new frontier. The industry’s generally consistent growth in recent decades as
    the economy has become more tech-centric means that many more senior workers—which
    in tech can sometimes be considered to mean over 35 but includes people in their
    late forties, fifties, or sixties—may have less experience with job hunting.

- en: For decades, tech workers could easily hop between jobs in their networks, often
    poached by recruiters. And as tech companies boomed during the Covid-19 pandemic’s
    early days, increased demand for skills gave workers leverage. Now the power has
    shifted to the employers as companies seek to become efficient and correct that
    overhiring phase, and [applicants are hitting walls](https://www.wired.com/story/tech-job-interviews-out-of-control/).
    Workers have to network, stay active on LinkedIn, join message boards, and stand
    out. With [four generations](https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/multi-generation-work-place-1.4980659#:~:text=For%20the%20first%20time%20in%20contemporary%20history%2C%20there%20are%20four,Z%20%E2%80%94%20human%20resources%20experts%20say.)
    now clocking in to work, things can feel crowded.
