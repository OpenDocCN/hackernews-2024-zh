    in tech. Even when ageism isn’t as blatant as the IBM case, she says, it lurks
    behind common ideas in industry hiring, such as culture fit. “If you have a company
    that is predominantly young, white, and male, it’s going to be harder to get in

- en: Industry and government data shows that US tech workers skew younger than the
    wider US workforce, but definitive data on differences in hiring patterns for
    older and younger tech workers has been hard to gather. That’s because so many
    more senior tech workers get jobs by networking or moving between companies where
    they know people rather than by cold applying, and that’s tricky to study and
    quantify, says Joanna Lahey, a professor of public policy at Texas A&M University
    who studies age discrimination.

  zh: 行业和政府数据显示，美国的技术工作者比整体美国劳动力年轻，但关于年长和年轻技术工作者招聘模式的差异的确切数据难以收集。这是因为更多的高级技术工作者通过人脉或在他们认识的公司之间流动来找到工作，而不是通过冷投简历，Joanna
    Lahey说，她是德克萨斯农工大学公共政策教授，研究年龄歧视。
- en: Older workers may be out of work for longer between jobs because they’re more
    likely to seek higher salaries or be selective, says Lahey. But if older workers
    are excluded from some positions because recruiters assume they wouldn’t take
    a lower offer or position or are perceived as not fitting into the company culture,
    that’s a problem, she says. “There are a lot of people who have a lot of skills
    who are unemployed longer than they ought to be. It’s a loss for them, and it’s
    a loss for society.”

  zh: 年长的工作者可能在工作之间的空档期更长，因为他们更有可能寻求更高的薪水或更加挑剔，Lahey说。但如果年长的工作者被排除在某些职位之外，因为猎头认为他们不会接受较低的报价或职位，或者认为他们不适合公司文化，这就是一个问题，她说。“有很多技能丰富的人失业时间比他们应该的时间长。这对他们来说是一种损失，也是社会的损失。”

    according to [Layoffs.fyi](https://layoffs.fyi/), which tracks job cuts in the
    industry. To older workers, the purge is both a reminder of the dotcom bust, and
    a new frontier. The industry’s generally consistent growth in recent decades as
    the economy has become more tech-centric means that many more senior workers—which
    in tech can sometimes be considered to mean over 35 but includes people in their
    late forties, fifties, or sixties—may have less experience with job hunting.
