- en: With the news that [Pepsi has announced a new logo](https://www.creativebloq.com/news/new-pepsi-logo),
    it's time to say goodbye to one of the more divisive designs of the 15 years.
    Fans are already calling the simpler, straighter and bolder new logo a "massive
    improvement" over the slanted 'globe' introduced in 2008\. But as well as that
    logo, people are also saying farewell to perhaps the most ridiculous, hilarious
    design document of all time.

- en: A leaked PDF offers an utterly mind-boggling glimpse into Pepsi's million-dollar
    rebrand from 2008\. The design refresh centres around the word 'breathtaking'
    and, well, that's certainly one way of putting it. (Looking for inspiration? Check
    out the [best logos](https://www.creativebloq.com/features/best-logos) of all
    time.)

     was allegedly created by New York-based brand consultancy agency Arnell Group,
    and was leaked by an "industry insider" on Reddit in 2009\. The whole thing is
    so ridiculous that some [believe](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/howaboutthat/4591892/Pepsi-logo-design-document-sparks-internet-hoax-debate.html)
    it's a hoax.

    [golden ratio](https://www.creativebloq.com/design/designers-guide-golden-ratio-12121546),
    and it's cool to see how those circles take inspiration from Pepsi logos throughout
    history. But things then move in some, er, unexpected directions. Things get deep.

    We are introduced to the Pepsi planet, the Pepsi [galaxy](https://www.creativebloq.com/tag/samsung-galaxy)
    and, of course, the Pepsi universe. We learn about the earth’s geodynamo – a naturally
    occurring electric generator in fluid motion which generates and sustains the
    earth’s magnetic field. And inspired the Pepsi logo, obviously. And perhaps the
    most preposterous claim in the entire document is that the Pepsi logo is based
    on the Mona Lisa.

- en: Indeed, it's one of the most infamous documents in the world of graphic design,
    and it's just as outrageous today as in 2009\. Lots of logos have fascinating
    histories, from the story of the [Apple logo's missing bite](https://www.creativebloq.com/news/apple-logo-history)
    to [Mercedes Benz's hybrid design](https://www.creativebloq.com/news/porsche-unseen-conceptshttps://www.creativebloq.com/news/mercedes-logo).
    But there's only logo out there that can claim to take inspiration from the exponential
    expansion of the universe on the basis of the positive and negative definite matrices
    and optimisation theorem.
