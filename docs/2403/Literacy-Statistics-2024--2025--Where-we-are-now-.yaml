- en: The capacity to read and write, commonly known as literacy, stands out as a
    pivotal determinant in shaping an individual's career trajectory. Individuals
    with literacy skills have access to a broad spectrum of career possibilities,
    including highly skilled and well-paying positions. Conversely, those lacking
    literacy face severely restricted options, with even entry-level, low-skilled
    jobs posing challenges to secure.

- en: 'Globally, the overall literacy rate stands at a commendable level. For individuals
    aged 15 and above, the combined literacy rate for both genders is 86.3%. Males
    in this age group exhibit a literacy rate of 90%, with females closely trailing
    at 82.7%. Notably, substantial variations exist between countries. Developed nations
    consistently boast adult literacy rates of 96% or higher, while the least developed
    countries struggle with an average literacy rate of just 65%. Accurate cross-country
    comparisons of literacy rates face challenges due to two primary factors: irregular
    reporting practices among countries, and divergent definitions of what constitutes
    literacy.'

- en: The nexus between poverty and literacy is pronounced, with these two challenges
    often interlinked. In impoverished regions, educational opportunities are frequently
    scarce, exacerbated by the necessity for struggling families to prioritize immediate
    income generation over sending their children to school. The majority of countries
    with the lowest literacy rates are concentrated in South Asia, West Asia, and
    sub-Saharan Africa, regions also characterized by a prevalence of the world's
    poorest nations.

- en: A discernible gender gap further compounds the issue of literacy, as nearly
    two-thirds of the approximately 781 million globally illiterate adults are female.
    This disparity is particularly evident in less-developed countries, where societal
    expectations often confine women to domestic roles, caring for the household and
    children while men pursue employment opportunities. In contrast, developed nations
    exhibit higher literacy rates with narrower, if any, gender gaps. For a comprehensive
    overview of global literacy rates, refer to the table below, which presents the
    latest and most reliable information available.
