    company’s social-media platforms are facilitating and profiting from the illegal
    sale of drugs," according to unnamed sources in a report today by the [*Wall Street
    Journal*](https://www.wsj.com/tech/u-s-is-investigating-meta-for-role-in-drug-sales-574944cb).
    Prosecutors reportedly sent Meta subpoenas last year seeking records on “violative
    drug content on Meta’s platforms and/or the illicit sale of drugs via Meta’s platforms.”
