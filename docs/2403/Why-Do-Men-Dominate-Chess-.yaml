    contesting the issue of whether transwomen (males who live and identify as women)
    should be eligible to compete in the female categories of numerous sports—including
    [rugby](https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/aug/11/banning-transgender-women-from-playing-womens-contact-rugby-absurd-claim-activists?ref=quillette.com),

    (widely known as [FIDE](https://www.fide.com/?ref=quillette.com), following on
    its French name, the Fédération Internationale des Échecs), for now, at least,
    transwomen [will not be permitted](https://doc.fide.com/docs/DOC/2FC2023/CM2_2023_45.pdf?ref=quillette.com)
    to compete in official events reserved for women.

    game—in which the most demanding physical movements consist of lifting small pieces
    of carved wood—even reserved a separate category for women in the first place.
    What could be the justification? And given that such a category exists, some might
    ask, why wouldn’t transwomen be allowed to identify into it? Some journalists
    and other commentators have been quick to [suggest](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/new-restrictions-trans-women-chess-players-match-games-sexist-history-rcna100968?ref=quillette.com)
    that the new policy is motivated by transphobia; but might there be sound reasons
    for the change? These are the questions I’ve set out to answer in this essay.
