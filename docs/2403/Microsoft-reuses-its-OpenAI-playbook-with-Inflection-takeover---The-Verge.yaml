    a would-be OpenAI challenger that raised hundreds of millions of dollars and is,
    for all intents and purposes, no more. This week, both companies announced that
    most of Inflection’s staff is joining a new AI division at Microsoft led by co-founder
    **Mustafa Suleyman**, who now reports directly to Nadella. The only co-founder
    of Inflection who will remain on the startup’s board is noted Microsoft board
    member **Reid Hoffman**.
