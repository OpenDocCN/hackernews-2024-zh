# Google Jamboard is winding down - Jamboard Help

Google Jamboard will no longer be available after **December 31, 2024** across Web, iOS, Android, and Google Meet devices. Your Jam data will be available for you to export or migrate to one of our whiteboard partners, like FigJam, Lucidspark, and Miro, until that date. 

## Why is Jamboard winding down?

Over the past couple of years, we’ve heard from customers that whiteboarding tools like FigJam by Figma, Lucidspark by Lucid, and Miro help them work better together. As these tools have grown more capable, offering advanced features such as an infinite canvas, use case templates, voting, and more, we’ve decided to leverage our partner ecosystem for whiteboarding in Workspace. Our focus is on core content collaboration across Docs, Sheets, and Slides.To that end, in late 2024 we will wind down the Jamboard whiteboarding app and continue with the [previously planned end of support for Google Jamboard devices](/a/answer/7374455). 

## What can I use moving forward? 

We're working with FigJam by Figma, Lucid Software, and Miro on migration paths for existing Jams so you don't lose your old work. Jamboard users can immediately start taking advantage of the new whiteboard technology on mobile, the web, within Google Meet, and on Series One devices. In addition to deep integration with Google Meet, users can also expect to see these whiteboard tools further incorporated into Google Workspace apps, including Drive, Calendar, and Docs. 

Keep in mind that your Jam file may not be 100% editable after migrating to a partner. Please check each partners’ website for details. 

You can start importing your Jamboard files using [FigJam by Figma](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/17028583915159-Migrate-Google-Jamboards-to-FigJam) and [Lucidspark by Lucid](https://help.lucid.co/hc/en-us/articles/18625100378644-Import-Jamboard-files-into-Lucidspark). In Q1 2024 you will also be able to import your Jamboard files using Miro.

## What should I do to prepare for this change? Will I be able to keep my Jam files in Drive?

We encourage all users to download the Jams they would like to keep before December 31, 2024\. Learn how to [Export your Jams](https://support.google.com/jamboard/answer/13864841).  

If you want to convert your existing Jams to our partner whiteboarding products, please see the links above in ***What can I use moving forward?***

## What happens after the shut down date?

After December 31, 2024, the Jamboard app will be shut down. You will no longer be able to view your Jams, and all Jam data will be permanently deleted. If there are Jams that you wish to keep, we encourage you to use one of our export or migration options. Learn how to [Export your Jams](https://support.google.com/jamboard/answer/13864841).  

## What if I own a Jamboard 55 device?

For details, check out [Jamboard device end of life information](/a/answer/13342662).

## What if I own a Series One Desk 27 and Board 65? Will there be another whiteboard app?

The Jamboard application will continue to work on the Series One Desk 27 and Board 65 devices until October 1, 2024\. Later this year, we will start to integrate with our whiteboard partners to bring their experiences to these devices.
