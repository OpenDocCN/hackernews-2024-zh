    than NVIDIA, if there's blobs we do not own the hardware, and I don't feel great
    about investing time into this.

    feature, but it looks like it can be triggered without that. Not being able to
    trust a compiler undermines so much trust in the entire platform.

    Tiny Corp and AMD. It will be interesting to see if AMD ends up open-sourcing
    their MES firmware or has some interim solution. Due to legal/code review it's
    unlikely to be a quick process and even more unlikely they would open up large
    swaths of their firmware. But due to customer demand they have been working on
    more open-source firmware in general such as with Sound Open Firmware support,
    the interesting openSIL efforts on the CPU side, and last year did
