    last week, I decided to try and replicate Ian‚Äôs results to see how many Upwork
    applications really come from AI bots.

    jobs had the highest proportion of bot applications to total applications at 15%,
    closely followed by marketing jobs. Software development had the lowest rate across
    the three categories (but maybe this was because developers were [better at prompting
    the AI](https://www.plusdocs.com/blog/how-to-write-an-effective-ai-prompt) to
    not reveal itself in the application response!).

    that there were several applications who seemed like they were NOT bots, and they
    actually read the job description. What a great way to stand out!

    To be honest, with the general quality of Upwork applications, I was expecting
    this number to be much higher than 12%. In fact, I think most applicants could
    actually *significantly* improve their applications by asking ChatGPT to customize
    their responses based on the contract.

    how AI can actually help Upwork match freelancers and job posters. It‚Äôs a lot
    of work to respond to proposals, and there are definitely great opportunities
    to use AI to help freelancers write better responses that highlight their relevant
    projects and experiences.
