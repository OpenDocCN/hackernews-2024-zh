    to be able to shave at your hearts will and the will to follow things through
    to the end. Here’s the way it was achieved with TeX. The recount is purely mine,
    inaccurate and obviously there for fun. I’ll avoid the most boring facts that
    everyone always tells, such as [why Knuth’s checks have their own Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knuth_reward_check).

    second edition of “The Art of Computer Programming”. The second edition had to
    be typeset again, as “hot type” typesetting, which was used for the first edition,
    was not available anymore. Being unimpressed by the available options, Knuth decided
    to write his own system, which later ended up as TeX.

    it is still unfinished, currently spanning 3.5 volumes (yes, the fourth is unfinished,

    scientist writers](https://web.archive.org/web/20080820030403/http://www.americanscientist.org/bookshelf/pub/100-or-so-books-that-shaped-a-century-of-science).'

    programming language. It was later replaced by WEB. What’s WEB? It’s a programming
    language, invented by… You’ll have guessed it by now, Donald Knuth. It transpiles
    to PASCAL. Knuth transpiled the WEB before it was cool.

    Knuth being known for research on algorithms couldn’t do without coming up with
    his own algorithm, later published together with Michael Plass. What does the
    algorithm do? It finds a visually pleasing way to lay out a paragraph on a page
    without making line breaks look jarring (for example by adjusting the “glue”,
    the whitespace between words). Here’s a [nice explanation](https://www.ugrad.cs.ubc.ca/~cs490/2015W2/lectures/Knuth.pdf).

    he wrote a description language for that, along with an interpreter to turn this
    descriptions into proper font files. This is [METAFONT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metafont).
    It’s not strictly part of TeX, it’s just that the Yak happened to stand close.

    it to? Now, everyone knows the horror printers invoke, so no one wants to deal
    with those directly. Classic TeX instead converts things to [DVI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Device_independent_file_format),
    the “device independent” format. I don’t know many details about it, except what’s
    on the wiki page, which feels the need to specifically point out that “DVI is
    not a document encryption format”. It is again a stack-based language (in contrast
    to PostScript not turing complete), which can then be interpreted through a driver,
    which would then send that to whatever target (a printer, PDF or such). It was
    designed by…

    each and every TeX document ever written builds. We’re talking about documents

    Lamport. Lamport is a very productive researcher, famous for research in formal
    methods through TLA+ and also known laying groundwork for many distributed algorithms.
    LaTeX is based on the idea of seperating presentation and content. It is based
    around the idea of document classes, which then describe the way a certain document
    is layed out. Think Markdown, just much more complex. The second is ConTeXt, which
    is far more focused on fine grained layout control.

    specialised TeX interpreters, such as `pdf(la)tex`, `lua(la)tex` and `xe(la)tex`.
    There’s a problem here: you are not allowed to change TeX and distribute [it under
    that name](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TeX#License). The thinking here is that
    if you have a `tex` binary, you can compile any valid TeX from the past and from

    so hard” when handling TeX, don’t forget how many years of work and especially
    knowledge were poured into that system. Typesetting isn’t the *most* popular knowledge
    around programmers. Especially see it in the context of the space it is in: they
    can’t remove legacy. Ever. That would break documents.'
  prefs: []

    should be approached as a typesetting system first. A lot of its confusing lingo
