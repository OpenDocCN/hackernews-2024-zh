    Yet at 40 metres (131ft) high, these are almost saplings – not even 150 years
    old and already almost twice as high as Cleopatra’s Needle.

    to poke above the forest canopy. But if they grow to their full potential, they’re
    going to be three times taller than most trees,” says Dr Phil Wilkes, part of
    the research team at Wakehurst, in West Sussex, an outpost of Kew Gardens. One
    or two of these California imports would be curiosities, such as the 100-metre
    high redwood that was stripped of its bark in 1854 and exhibited to Victorian
    crowds at the Crystal Palace in south-east London, until it was [destroyed by
    fire in 1866](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/blog/2013/jun/27/giant-tree-death-conservation-movement).

    has many more than these three. The Victorians were so impressed that they brought
    seeds and seedlings from the US in such large numbers that there are now approximately
    500,000 in Britain, according to a Forestry Commission estimate that includes
    coastal redwoods and dawn redwoods (a separate Chinese species) as well as the
    giant redwoods. Experts at Kew think most of the UK trees are giant sequoias,
    the official name for giant redwoods. California has about 80,000 giant redwoods,
    as well as also having coastal redwoods and a few ornamental dawn redwoods imported
    from China.

    data and Lidar – light detection and radar – to create 3D laser images of trees,
    a way to measure the size and mass of trees more precisely than the traditional
    method of measuring their trunks’ circumferences.
