    vulnerabilities in popular virtual private networking software made by Utah-based
    IT firm Ivanti. For several weeks, CISA has urged federal agencies and private
    firms to update their software or take other defensive measures in response to
    widespread exploitation of Ivanti vulnerabilities by hackers.

    be victims of hacking. After all, they rely on the same technology that others
    do. The US’ top cybersecurity diplomat Nate Fick said last year that his personal
    account on social media platform X was [hacked](https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/05/politics/nate-fick-twitter-hack-cybersecurity/index.html),
    calling it part of the “perils of the job.”
