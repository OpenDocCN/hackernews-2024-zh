    runs a program that allows federal, state and local officials to share cyber and
    physical security assessment tools, according to the US officials briefed on the
    matter. The other holds information on security assessment of chemical facilities,
    the sources said.

    and having an incident response plan in place is a necessary component of resilience,”

    vulnerabilities in popular virtual private networking software made by Utah-based
    IT firm Ivanti. For several weeks, CISA has urged federal agencies and private
    firms to update their software or take other defensive measures in response to
    widespread exploitation of Ivanti vulnerabilities by hackers.

    be victims of hacking. After all, they rely on the same technology that others
    do. The US’ top cybersecurity diplomat Nate Fick said last year that his personal
    account on social media platform X was [hacked](https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/05/politics/nate-fick-twitter-hack-cybersecurity/index.html),
    calling it part of the “perils of the job.”
