    Omnia*](https://www.siliconera.com/dissidia-final-fantasy-opera-omnia-is-the-end-of-an-era/),
    a mobile game based on Square Enix’s [*Final Fantasy* fighting game series](https://www.polygon.com/2017/6/7/15753586/final-fantasy-dissidia-ps4-square-enix-team-ninja).
    Since launching in the US in 2018, the game has amassed over 170 characters from
    across 30 years of *Final Fantasy* history, scattered throughout four acts composed
    of multiple chapters and side stories representing hundreds of hours of a game
    that can no longer be played. Though *Opera Omnia* is officially gone, one person
    has shouldered the task to ensure the game hasn’t completely disappeared.

    every *Dissidia* *Final Fantasy Opera Omnia* cutscene and [upload[ing] them to

    [wrote Hatok](https://x.com/HatokTalk/status/1762940276698718398?s=20), a video
    editor and self-described video game enthusiast. “And now, 7 hours from the end
    of service, I’ve reached the end of this massive project.”

    game had to offer. More than simply capturing raw footage, Hatok ensured the cutscenes
    he preserved featured characters with their canon weapons and that battle scenes
    weren’t populated with random characters — an effort that added a significant
    amount of time to the project because it required watching every cutscene twice.

    weren’t just full of [a] random party of characters,” Hatok says in an interview
    with *The Verge*. “So I’d watch through them once, make a note of any characters
    who spoke, and then reference the scene directly before or after to determine
    which characters should be in the fight and where they should be positioned.”

    Omnia* was the only mobile game that really “stuck” for him. “[The game] had a
    lot of mechanical depth and fun design, and it was fairly easy to build the characters
    you wanted,” he says.

    beyond the typical mobile gacha game. *Opera Omnia* reached across *Final Fantasy*
    history, crafting stories that offered greater insights into characters and their
    motivations like Lightning from *Final Fantasy XIII*.

    that and explore what it is about her that drives her to help people,” Hatok says.

    the ultimate *Final Fantasy* crossover fanfiction, pairing up Quina, the frog-eating
    chef from *FF9*, and Noctis, the frog-catching protagonist from *FF15*. The game
    “made incredible use of the characters,” creating interactions impossible in canon,
    like hearing more from Vaan’s deceased brother in *FF12* and Yuna’s deceased father
    from *FF10*. It’s that depth that drove Hatok to this project.

    new, and fans have [tackled similar projects for games like *Dragalia Lost*](/2022/9/1/23330632/free-to-play-gacha-games-closures-dragalia-lost-kingdom-hearts).
    In fact, Square Enix [has done it for *Opera Omnia*](https://go.redirectingat.com/?xs=1&id=1025X1701640&url=https%3A%2F%2Fyoutube.com%2Fplaylist%3Flist%3DPLJOgCm9D4x88cz-qvLU15cN9zVN6coIGf%26si%3DnOiYDlpCpT_RJWaI).
    But according to Hatok, Square Enix’s uploads are incomplete. “[Square Enix] did
    something I was worried they’d do,” Hatok says. “They didn’t preserve any of the
    cutscenes that happen in battle.”

    Without them, he explains, the discrete story cutscenes can lose cohesion and
    valuable context gets lost. In Square Enix’s official upload, cutscenes will directly
    reference events that happened in the absent battle scenes, creating a hole in
    the storytelling while characters pop in and out of the narrative without explanation.

    typically get left behind despite being one the most vulnerable types of game.
    Unlike most console and PC games, which tend to remain available for purchase
    and play after their life cycles end, when a publisher decides to stop supporting
    a mobile game, it’s often removed from storefronts, preventing new players from
    discovering it, while current players await the day the game vanishes from their
    devices entirely.
