    countries, even surpassing death rates in Central and Eastern European countries,
    and midlife mortality rates in the UK are not great either. A new study has examined
    what's caused this rise in the death rates of these two cultural superpowers.

    decade and has continued to the present day. A [2021 study](https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.2019536118)
    calculated that if the current pace continues, most children born this millennium
    will live to celebrate their 100th birthday. However, new research by the Leverhulme
    Center for Demographic Science (LCDS) at the University of Oxford and Princeton
    University has revealed some troubling trends for those in midlife, particularly
    in the US and the UK.

    Eastern European countries,” said Katarzyna Doniec, the study’s corresponding
    author. “This is surprising, given that not so long ago, some of these countries
    experienced high levels of working-age mortality, resulting from the post-socialist
    [economic] crisis of the 1990s.”

    particular communities and show trends in specific causes of death over time.

    16 other high-income countries (Austria, Australia, Belgium, Canada, Denmark,
    France, Finland, Germany, Italy, Japan, Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain,
    Sweden, and Switzerland) and seven Central and Eastern European (CEE) countries
    (Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, and Slovenia).
    All-cause and cause-specific mortality rates, as deaths per 100,000 individuals,
    were calculated for three age groups – 25 to 44, 45 to 54, and 55 to 64 – by country,
