- en: It wasn't obvious to outsiders why [Williams Racing](https://www.thedrive.com/accelerator/36153/the-williams-family-is-out-of-their-formula-1-team)
    has slowly slipped down the Formula 1 standings over last two decades. There's
    been [vague talk of outdated processes and internal under-investment](https://www.thedrive.com/news/new-williams-f1-boss-says-facilities-and-tech-20-years-out-of-date),
    but only now do we have a specific example. That would be the hellacious Microsoft
    Excel spreadsheet that team principal James Vowles says has been a major drag
    on car development for years.

    that on joining the team in early 2023, he found its internal processes were a
    disaster. The team's entire car-building process was reportedly so inefficient
    that even when the design was done in good time, disorganized parts management
    meant the 2024 car was just a pile of parts with just three weeks until testing.
    Some of this was down to how Williams kept inventory—in a monster of an Excel
    spreadsheet.

- en: The way Vowles and technical director Pat Fry reportedly recounted it, Williams
    has been using a spreadsheet that grew to include some 20,000 parts used to make
    its cars. Williams has apparently relied on such spreadsheets for years now, including
    even for the 2024 car at early stages.

    [the hectomillion-dollar sport that is F1](https://www.thedrive.com/accelerator/22168/behind-the-shadowy-billion-dollar-payouts-of-f1-nascar-and-indycar)),
    it was also desperately lacking in important logistical info. The team reportedly
    didn't have a central resource that tracked what parts cost, how long they took
    to make, or even how many they had or where they were stored. This forced production
    staff to search for parts whose location hadn't been documented, wasting valuable
    time.

    it will take before it''s complete, how long it will take before it goes to inspection.
    If there''s been any problems with inspections, whether it has to go back again.
    And once you start putting that level of complexity in which is where modern [Formula
    1](https://www.thedrive.com/category/f1) is, the Excel spreadsheet falls over,
    and humans fall over. And that''s exactly where we are."'

- en: Such a convoluted parts database may have contributed to the team showing up
    late for preseason testing in 2019\. It also played a role in Williams' weak in-season
    development, apparently ballooning the cost of the team's mid-2023 upgrade to
    "extraordinary" levels.

    a comprehensive "technology base" overhaul, with the goal of restoring the team
    to competitiveness. Obviously, Williams would like to be back at the front of
    the grid as soon as possible, but these things take time. And maybe still a few
    Excel spreadsheets here and there.
