- en: The requests from independent journalists for grants, including personal emergency
    grants, have been coming in extra fast lately. Receiving them, me and my staff
    at the [Economic Hardship Reporting Project](https://economichardship.org/) feel
    like Lucille Ball grabbing the chocolates on the conveyor belt in that factory
    episode of *I Love Lucy*. The pace is picking up as publication closures and media
    layoffs push many into the world of full-time freelancing, where they compete
    for dwindling payouts against mounting competition. And as of last week, the *Intercept,*
    where my husband Peter Maass worked for ten years, has laid off fifteen of its
    staffers — including him. The media emergency just got even more personal.

    and bodacious with ads, has laid off its staff. *Pitchfork*, long my go-to for
    tart and encyclopedic endorsements or takedowns of music, has been folded, in
    a much-reduced form, into *GQ* — two media entities that, if they were people,
    would have never spoken to each other in high school. Meanwhile, the venerable
    *Los Angeles Times* announced it would be laying off at least 115 people, more
    than 20 percent of its staff.

    in crisis, but not enough calls for action. Few people have any clue what to call
    for. What we need now are three major shifts. First, we need to pursue a program
    of fresh near-term media policy reform. Second, we need a new paradigm for media
    — an ambitious longer-term transformation in funding and ownership. And third,
    we need an immediate harm-reduction response for reporters and smaller media entities
    at grave risk.

    by communications scholar [Robert McChesney](https://catalyst-journal.com/2023/06/how-to-save-journalism).
    Drawing from participatory budgeting and inspired by economist Dean Baker, McChesney’s
    idea for reform is a local government process where citizens vote on how their
    county or city’s government media budget should be directed. McChesney proposes
    a news media voucher program — the Citizenship News Voucher — which, as he wrote
    in 2010, would make it so that “every American adult gets a $200 voucher she can
    use to donate government money to any nonprofit news medium of her choice. She
    will indicate her choice on her tax return. . . . A government agency, possibly
    operating out of the Internal Revenue Service, can be set up to allocate the funds
    and to determine eligibility.”

    Washington, DC has started looking at a media voucher plan after a council member
    introduced a novel bill, which would offer government-funded vouchers to DC residents
    that they can donate to local journalism venues that they select.

    California Assembly Bill 179, which provided $25 million for local reporting in

    is not only feasible but already underway.

    and sustainable media ecosystem, we should change our mindset about and framing
    of what media is. Not-for-profit media must become the norm — not the exception.
    Media, after all, is a form of education.

    (WPA) model, where 6,600 reporters were sent out into the field, underwritten
    by the government, as part of the New Deal’s response to the Great Depression,
    covering the lives of some of the poorest Americans. Our organization, the Economic
    Hardship Reporting Project, is a version of this — only, given the absence of
    WPA-style policy programs of late, without the public funding part. We support
    hundreds of journalists, a good number of them financially struggling, to report
    on their experiences and communities and then copublish them nationally. But we
    are a staff of four, and this is a nonprofit that we raise money for each year.
    The government needs a version of what we are doing on a much larger scale.

    who offered me a T-shirt-ready quote: “Capitalism and journalism was always a
    match made in hell.” We need to accept that the problems we’re seeing now are
    inherent to market-driven media. Pickard puts the beginning of the end of the
    industry as far back in the ’90s — *the 1890s*, when sensationalist “yellow journalism”
    was replaced by the model of “objective” news, only under corporate ownership
    and for corporate profits. While some romanticize a time when newspaper reporters
    were working-class ink-stained wretches in visors who didn’t go to college and
    spoke in the same colorful language of their sources, in truth the news media
    was owned by the proverbial Citizen Kanes, not by the guys doing the typesetting.'

    society a century ago, media historians like Pickard note. Sure, in the last ten
    or fifteen years, this market failure has accelerated, given diminished ad revenue.
    But it’s simply the extension of a far-longer pattern. We must then consider an
    alternative: an independent public media system — “public” meaning that we fund
    it through taxes, and “independent” meaning that it’s not just a government mouthpiece.
    In [an article](https://jacobin.com/2020/01/corporate-media-system-democracy)
    for *Jacobin* in 2020, Pickard laid out his [vision](https://jacobin.com/2020/01/corporate-media-system-democracy)
    for what this nonmarket media system would look like. “Our goal must be to reinvent
    news media, not shore up old commercial models,” he wrote. “Given this chance
    to unhook journalism from profit imperatives, we can reclaim and reinvent a public
    good.”'

    example was initiated by Emily Dugdale, thirty-two, who was a union shop steward
    when she worked at the local NPR station in Los Angeles. Dugdale responded immediately
    when she saw *Los Angeles Times*’ bloodletting by, as [she tweeted](https://twitter.com/eedugdale/status/1750530552787296443),
    “putting together an LA mutual aid network for journalists who have been laid
    off.” The project consists of “one-time grants for small amounts of monetary support,
    ways for laid-off reporters to connect, and ways they can share their resumes,”
    says Dugdale.

    that offered consolation, food, and sometimes money to many who had been failed
    by their legislators. In my last book, I called structures like mutual aid part
    of the “dystopian social safety net,” arguing that these DIY systems *shouldn’t*
    be needed, but also should be encouraged and supported because they are necessary.
    And the demand for them today is obvious. In 2023, media job losses were up [50
    percent](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2024/01/media-layoffs-la-times/677285/).
    Remaining workers are subject to stagnating wages and rising living costs. Journalists,
    especially ones from working-class backgrounds with little savings or generational
    wealth, can’t participate in the media any longer. Media workers need assistance,
    for their benefit and ours.

    “The horrors of modern corporate publishing are eating the public commons alive
    every day,” the [group stated](https://flaminghydra.com/about/). *Flaming Hydra*
