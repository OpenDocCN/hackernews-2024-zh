    on [Facebook Marketplace](https://www.facebook.com/marketplace/item/1605213976948102/?mibextid=79PoIi),
    for a price that makes it look like a steal by comparison.

    Marketplace](https://www.facebook.com/marketplace/item/1605213976948102/?mibextid=79PoIi)上出售，价格使其看起来像是一笔交易。
- en: The Chevy S-10 Electric was one of several early EVs that automakers rolled
    out in the 1990s. It got its drivetrain from GM's EV1 program, meaning it was
    front-wheel drive rather than rear-drive, and detuned to 114 horsepower to account
    for its extra weight. That meant zero to 50 mph (yes, fifty) took 13.5 seconds,
    and that it topped out at only 71 mph.

  zh: 1990年代，通用汽车推出了多款早期电动车型之一，即雪佛兰S-10电动车。它的动力系统来自通用汽车的EV1计划，意味着它是前轮驱动而不是后轮驱动，马力降至114匹，以适应额外的重量。这意味着从零加速到50英里/小时（是的，五十英里/小时）需要13.5秒，并且最高速度仅为71英里/小时。

- en: Like modern EVs, it stowed its batteries in the floor, specifically in the rails
    of the truck's ladder chassis. The standard battery was a [15 kilowatt-hour](https://avt.inl.gov/sites/default/files/pdf/fsev/chvs10.pdf)
    array of lead-acid batteries, but a [29-kWh](https://avt.inl.gov/sites/default/files/pdf/fsev/s10.pdf)
    nickel-metal-hydride pack was also available. They gave about 60 and 130 miles
    of range respectively, and charged using an inductive "Magne Charge" paddle that
    attached behind the license plate. (This charger was also shared with [the original
    Toyota RAV4 EV](https://www.thedrive.com/tech/38331/the-toyota-rav4-ev-was-a-breakthrough-electric-crossover-20-years-before-that-was-a-thing).)

  zh: 就像现代电动车一样，它将电池存放在地板上，具体来说是在卡车梯架底盘的导轨中。标准电池是一个铅酸电池阵列，容量为[15千瓦时](https://avt.inl.gov/sites/default/files/pdf/fsev/chvs10.pdf)，但也提供了一个[29千瓦时](https://avt.inl.gov/sites/default/files/pdf/fsev/s10.pdf)的镍氢电池包。它们分别提供约60英里和130英里的续航里程，并使用一种感应式“Magne
    Charge”挡板进行充电，该挡板安装在车牌后面。（这种充电器也与[原始的丰田RAV4 EV](https://www.thedrive.com/tech/38331/the-toyota-rav4-ev-was-a-breakthrough-electric-crossover-20-years-before-that-was-a-thing)共享。）
- en: Just 492 S-10 Electrics were made, and they met the same fate as the EV1\. Most
    were leased, so they were simply recalled and destroyed. [A small number of EV1s
    escaped this fate though](https://www.thedrive.com/news/38743/theres-a-pristine-gm-ev1-saved-by-a-secretive-caretaker-in-the-depths-of-a-university),
    as did an apparent 60 S-10 Electrics that a fleet customer had bought outright.
    One of those survivors, number 145, is the one currently for sale out of Peru,
    Indiana.

  zh: 只生产了492辆S-10电动车，它们和EV1一样面临着同样的命运。大多数都是租赁车辆，因此它们被简单地召回并销毁。[但有少量EV1逃过一劫](https://www.thedrive.com/news/38743/theres-a-pristine-gm-ev1-saved-by-a-secretive-caretaker-in-the-depths-of-a-university)，似乎还有60辆S-10电动车被一个企业客户全款购买。其中一辆幸存的车辆，编号145，目前在印第安纳州的秘鲁出售。

- en: The truck was originally one of the lead-acid battery models, and the seller
    says the pack has been removed and confirmed to be dead. There's apparently [an
    aftermarket upgrade available that lets you switch to LFP batteries](https://www.trajectoryev.com/ev-store/p/vc5vdtrqulztwgxsnyd9cqgnz97ao2-k63k3),
    which boosts range to more than 150 miles, but it appears to cost almost $12,000\.
    That's on top of the $15,000 the seller asks for the truck, which is missing its
    tailgate but still has its Magne Charge paddle.

  zh: 这辆卡车最初是铅酸电池型号之一，卖家表示电池组已拆除并确认无法使用。显然，[有一种售后升级方案可以更换为LFP电池](https://www.trajectoryev.com/ev-store/p/vc5vdtrqulztwgxsnyd9cqgnz97ao2-k63k3)，这可以将续航里程提升至150英里以上，但看起来成本接近12000美元。这是卖家要求15000美元购买这辆卡车的额外费用，尽管车辆没有车尾门，但仍带有其Magne
    Charge插座。
- en: Still, you're looking at around $30,000 in for a little electric pickup that
    was actually designed as a work truck. We won't be able to get another vehicle
    like that in the U.S. for a long time (if ever, the way things are going), so
    maybe it's time to turn the clock back while you still can.
