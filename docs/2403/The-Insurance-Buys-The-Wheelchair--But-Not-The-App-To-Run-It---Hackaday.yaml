- en: The writer Cory Doctorow coined the term *enshittification* to describe the
    way that services decline in quality as their users become the product. He was
    talking about online services when he came up with the word, but the same is very
    much true when it comes to hardware. Items which once just worked now need apps
    and online services, with marginal benefit to the user if any. It’s one thing
    when it’s your soundbar or your washing machine, but thanks to Lemmy user [@win95]
    from the Netherlands we’ve seen a far more egregious example. People with disabilities
    are being provided with new powered wheelchairs through their medical insurance,
    [but are then discovering that unaffordable in-app purchases are needed to use
    their features](https://lemmy.zip/post/11077316).

- en: The chairs in question come from the German company [Alber](https://www.alber.de/en/),
    and it seems their defence for the practice is that an Alber chair can be used
    without the paid-for software upgrades. Reading the many comments attached to
    the thread linked above it seems this is not a view shared by the people with
    disabilities who have the chairs, so we’d be extremely interested to know more
    from both the company and its customers. Either way, selling a very expensive
    mobility aid and then demanding hundreds more Euros for its features via [the
    app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.alber.emotion_m25) seems
    to us if it’s as described, to be at least rather questionable. We hope therefore
    that it attracts some publicity, and the company is shamed into abandoning the
    practice.

- en: It would be tempting here to exhort the hacker community to blow whatever protocols
    these chairs use wide open, and create a free and open source app which runs everything
    on an Alber chair. We certainly know enough people with the skills to do this,
    and we’re certain there are many more among our readers. But oddly here this isn’t
    the answer, and not because they might resort to legal measures such as the DMCA.
    A wheelchair is a vital mobility device for its users and superficially a straightforward
    enough machine, but it’s also a medical device which has to adhere to a bunch
    of standards to ensure that it doesn’t harm its user. For that reason perhaps
    it’s better to shame the manufacturer into ending the practice, and ensuring that
    people with Alber chairs can use them without resorting to hackery. After all,
    becoming [an engineer saviour](https://hackaday.com/2017/08/03/avoiding-the-engineer-saviour-trap/)
    by accident is always something to be wary of.
