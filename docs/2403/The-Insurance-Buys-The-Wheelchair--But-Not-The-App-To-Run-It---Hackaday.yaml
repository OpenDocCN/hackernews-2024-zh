- en: The writer Cory Doctorow coined the term *enshittification* to describe the
    way that services decline in quality as their users become the product. He was
    talking about online services when he came up with the word, but the same is very
    much true when it comes to hardware. Items which once just worked now need apps
    and online services, with marginal benefit to the user if any. It’s one thing
    when it’s your soundbar or your washing machine, but thanks to Lemmy user [@win95]
    from the Netherlands we’ve seen a far more egregious example. People with disabilities
    are being provided with new powered wheelchairs through their medical insurance,
    [but are then discovering that unaffordable in-app purchases are needed to use
    their features](https://lemmy.zip/post/11077316).

  zh: 作家Cory Doctorow创造了术语*enshittification*，用来描述随着用户成为产品，服务质量下降的方式。他当初提出这个词时讨论的是在线服务，但是硬件也同样如此。曾经一切正常运作的物品现在却需要应用程序和在线服务，对用户的好处微乎其微，如果有的话。当你的音响条或洗衣机需要这样做时，问题就来了，但多亏了来自荷兰的Lemmy用户[@win95]，我们见识到了一个更加令人震惊的例子。残疾人通过他们的医疗保险获得了新的电动轮椅，[却发现需要通过应用内购买来使用其功能](https://lemmy.zip/post/11077316)，而这是无法承受之重。
- en: The chairs in question come from the German company [Alber](https://www.alber.de/en/),
    and it seems their defence for the practice is that an Alber chair can be used
    without the paid-for software upgrades. Reading the many comments attached to
    the thread linked above it seems this is not a view shared by the people with
    disabilities who have the chairs, so we’d be extremely interested to know more
    from both the company and its customers. Either way, selling a very expensive
    mobility aid and then demanding hundreds more Euros for its features via [the
    app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.alber.emotion_m25) seems
    to us if it’s as described, to be at least rather questionable. We hope therefore
    that it attracts some publicity, and the company is shamed into abandoning the
    practice.

  zh: 问题中的轮椅来自德国公司[Alber](https://www.alber.de/en/)，看起来他们为这一做法辩护的理由是，Alber的椅子可以在没有付费软件升级的情况下使用。阅读上述链接主题的许多评论，似乎残疾人并不认同这一观点，因此我们非常希望能从公司及其客户那里了解更多信息。无论如何，卖出一种非常昂贵的移动辅助工具，然后通过[应用](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.alber.emotion_m25)要求用户再支付数百欧元以使用其功能，如果确实如此，至少是非常值得质疑的。因此，我们希望此事能引起一些关注，迫使公司放弃这一做法。
- en: It would be tempting here to exhort the hacker community to blow whatever protocols
    these chairs use wide open, and create a free and open source app which runs everything
    on an Alber chair. We certainly know enough people with the skills to do this,
    and we’re certain there are many more among our readers. But oddly here this isn’t
    the answer, and not because they might resort to legal measures such as the DMCA.
    A wheelchair is a vital mobility device for its users and superficially a straightforward
    enough machine, but it’s also a medical device which has to adhere to a bunch
    of standards to ensure that it doesn’t harm its user. For that reason perhaps
    it’s better to shame the manufacturer into ending the practice, and ensuring that
    people with Alber chairs can use them without resorting to hackery. After all,
    becoming [an engineer saviour](https://hackaday.com/2017/08/03/avoiding-the-engineer-saviour-trap/)
    by accident is always something to be wary of.

  zh: 在这里诱惑人们开发者社区来打破这些轮椅所使用的任何协议，创造一个自由开源的应用程序，来运行Alber轮椅上的一切。我们当然知道有足够的人拥有这样的技能，而且我们相信在我们的读者中还有更多人。但奇怪的是，在这里这不是答案，不是因为他们可能会诉诸法律手段，比如DMCA。轮椅对于其用户来说是至关重要的移动设备，表面上看是足够简单的机器，但它也是一个医疗设备，必须遵守一系列标准，以确保不会对用户造成伤害。也许因此，更好的做法是让制造商感到羞愧，停止这种做法，并确保使用Alber轮椅的人不必求助于技术手段。毕竟，意外成为[工程救世主](https://hackaday.com/2017/08/03/avoiding-the-engineer-saviour-trap/)总是需要警惕的事情。
