    embedded environments. For example, the Pico C SDK does depend on an embedded
    libc AFAIK, but that's a topic for the other thread [Embedded Swift running on
    the Raspberry Pi Pico](https://forums.swift.org/t/embedded-swift-running-on-the-raspberry-pi-pico/69001).
    You're right that the from-scratch approach we're discussing in this thread doesn't
    need it.

    into the binary (the RP2040 won't boot unless this checksum is there). This is
    currently done by a Python script.

- en: We can prebuild boot2 and crt0, but then we're also no longer talking about
    a simple package that you can include as a dependency, right (because of the binary
    files involved)? And it doesn't solve how to pass the linker script to the final
    link step.

- en: I think my biggest problem in doing any SwiftPM experiments right now is that
    I can't use `swift` as the linker to build a Pico executable – I have to use Clang
    for linking. I don't think I can tell SwiftPM to link with Clang unless I build
    an SE-0387-style SDK?

    That directory doesn't exist. Should it exist? Will it exist in the future as
    the embedded toolchain improves?
