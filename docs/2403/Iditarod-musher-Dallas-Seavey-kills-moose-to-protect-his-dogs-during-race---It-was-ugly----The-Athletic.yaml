    the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race early Monday morning that he was forced to shoot
    the moose with a handgun out of self-defense, “after the moose became entangled
    with the dogs and the musher,” a statement from the race [said](https://iditarod.com/dallas-seavey-encounters-and-dispatches-moose-outside-of-skwentna/).

    if an edible big game animal — like a moose, caribou or buffalo — is killed in
    defense of life or property, the musher is required to gut the animal and report
    it to race officials at the next checkpoint. Mushers who follow must help gut
    the animal when possible and no teams may pass until the animal is gutted and
    the musher gutting the animal has proceeded. Any other animal killed in defense
    of life or property must be reported to a race official but is not required to
    be gutted.

    in size from 800 pounds (small adult female) to 1,600 pounds (large adult male),
    and they can be up to almost 6 feet tall. While moose, which are prevalent in
    Alaska, are not normally aggressive, they can be dangerous if provoked or confronted,
    according to the [Alaska Department of Fish and Game](https://www.adfg.alaska.gov/index.cfm?adfg=livewith.moose#:~:text=While%20not%20normally%20aggressive%2C%20moose,Never%20approach%20a%20moose!).

    of 12, per race rules. A musher must finish with at least five dogs on the towline,
    and no dogs can be added to a team after the start of the race. Dog deaths during
    the Iditarod occur for many reasons including injury, illness or frostbite.

    in collisions with snowmobiles while training on shared, multi-use trails shortly
    before this year’s race, per the AP. At the Iditarod start, mushers could grab
    light-up, neon harnesses or necklaces for their dogs for greater visibility. Mushers
    typically wear a bright headlamp for visibility, but that doesn’t protect lead
    dogs running nearly 60 feet ahead.

    or lost limbs in a November 2023 crash. While training on the Denali Highway,
    which is approximately 260 miles north of Anchorage by car, one of Seavey’s teams
    was hit by a snowmachine traveling 65 miles in the opposite direction, Seavey
