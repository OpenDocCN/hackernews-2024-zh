    shy, introverted person, understands its functions. Lowe works at a technology
    public relations firm where chitchat with clients and journalists is just another
    part of the job. As a previous user of dating apps (Lowe is happily partnered
    now), he realized banter reigned supreme. He also plays bass in bands in Seattle;
    meeting other collaborators involves some amount of introductory small talk.

    attention to his conversation partners to discover “what makes them tick, what
    drives them,” he explains. He’ll ask what books people are reading or [movies](/movies)
    or [television](/tv) they enjoy. “Then just making sure that when you go into
    those situations,” Lowe says, “you are more interested in the person that you’re
    talking to than talking about yourself.”

    for being too surface-level, too rote, a throwaway filler conversation. But casual
    chat can be the on-ramp to deeper connection. After all, most of us wouldn’t introduce
    ourselves to a stranger with a question about their biggest fears. Small talk
    is an opportunity to build trust and to learn about others, and to become a more
    curious person, says [Georgie Nightingall](https://www.georgienightingall.co.uk/),
    a conversation specialist and human connectivity researcher. “Being genuinely
    curious, that always helps,” she says. “You can actually realize that you do want
    to know more rather than having that sense of like, I’m just asking for the sake
    of asking.”'

    without moving on to deeper conversation. “One of the key elements of small talk,”
    she says, “is having the mindset that actually this is not where we’re going to
    end up.” Consider all the relationships that began as banter or the [job opportunities
    that came from acquaintances](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/06/smarter-living/why-you-need-a-network-of-low-stakes-casual-friendships.html).

    that most introductory small talk with strangers does in fact go well. As people
    engage in these chats with greater frequency, the more confident they are in their
    abilities to talk to strangers, according to the study. “That’s enough to allow
    you to be in the moment more instead of in panic mode,” Sandstrom says.

    the questions “So, what do you do?” and “How are you?” Often, people give unengaging
    or throwaway answers that don’t give the other person much to respond to. Instead,
    lead with inquiries related to your interests, says [Adam Smiley Poswolsky,](https://www.smileyposwolsky.com/)
    a workplace belonging expert and author of [*Friendship in the Age of Loneliness:
    An Optimist’s Guide to Connection*](https://www.hachettebookgroup.com/titles/adam-smiley-poswolsky/friendship-in-the-age-of-loneliness/9780762472260/?lens=running-press).
    Consider asking a barista at your neighborhood cafe about their favorite beverage
    or if a friend of a friend at a party has also watched the newest season of *Love
    Is Blind*. If you want to feel a little more prepared, Poswolsky suggests having
    a list of five or so questions at the ready that are topical and feel authentic
    to you — just be sure to refresh your list every few weeks. Maybe your talking
    points include asking if someone has an upcoming vacation or if they tried any
    new restaurants recently.'

    Something as simple as “This line is taking forever,” or “[Mutual friend’s name]
    makes the best cheese boards,” or “You have the cutest dog I have ever seen” can
    be an effective entrée to small talk. [Research has found](https://myscp.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jcpy.1387)
    that making an observation about a product or item another person has chosen to
    display — like a band T-shirt or a colorful hat — is a better conversation starter
    than discussing the weather. Initiating a chat with someone wearing a shirt from
    your alma mater is easier than attempting to find common ground with nothing to
    go on. “Those conversations tend to go better,” says the study’s lead author,
    [Hillary Wiener](https://www.albany.edu/business/faculty/hillary-wiener), an assistant
    professor of marketing at the University at Albany, “because it’s on something
    that both people involved might actually care about.” The products that were most
    successful at launching a conversation “suggested a point of commonality between
    the asker and the person wearing, using a product,” she says. For example, try
    approaching someone in a Taylor Swift shirt if you too love Taylor Swift or sharing
    a hiking story with someone who is drinking out of a water bottle from Yosemite
    National Park.

    — involves active listening. If someone mentions the city they grew up in, you
    can use that detail for follow-up questions. What did they like the most about
    that city? What did they dislike? Why did they move? You can even offer a personal
    anecdote, Nightingall says, maybe mentioning a trip you may have taken there.
    “Whenever someone shares anything with you, they’re sharing a tiny dot in a web
    of hugeness,” Nightingall says. “Our job is to find out what makes this person
    different, interesting. What makes their life unique?”

    the more likely the other party will be interested in continuing the conversation,

    furthering the discussion.

    conversation partner the wrong way. For small talk with strangers, especially,
    a well-meaning question may not be taken as intended or they may suspect you of
    trying to flirt with them. Small talk is warm and introductory, with no ulterior
    motives. It can surely blossom into a more flirtatious exchange but you should
    lead with curiosity and friendliness. “You can’t realistically be sitting next
    to someone on the plane and say, ‘Hi, what’s your favorite superpower,’” Wiener
    says. “That doesn’t work on a human interaction level.” Starting with an observation
    about how packed the flight is or asking whether the person is traveling for work
    might be more of a context-appropriate introduction.

    or religious wear. Never make assumptions about or comment on someone’s background,
    income level, sexuality, political stance, or other personal identifier.

    lines is “What are you doing?” “I saw someone who was leaning over a bush and
    lifting up a leaf,” she says “and I’m like, ‘What’s going on here?’ They taught
    me some stuff about bugs.” But do your best to keep the mood playful — you’re
    asking out of curiosity, not suspicion.

    Whether you find yourself giving one-word answers or the discussion veers toward
    potentially contentious territory, there are ways of deftly navigating. For chats
    that are veering on boring, feel free to direct the conversation to another topic
    or ask a random question. (Conversations aren’t linear anyway, Nightingall notes.)

    force it, Poswolsky says. Either politely excuse yourself (“I’ve got to run to
    the bathroom” is a great exit) if you’re at a social gathering or simply drop
    the chitchat if you’re mingling with a stranger on public transit. For talks that
    become prejudiced or offensive, Sandstrom suggests saying “This conversation is
    making me uncomfortable.” Just remember, both people need buy-in for small talk
    to be productive.
