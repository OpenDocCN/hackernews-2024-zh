    shy, introverted person, understands its functions. Lowe works at a technology
    public relations firm where chitchat with clients and journalists is just another
    part of the job. As a previous user of dating apps (Lowe is happily partnered
    now), he realized banter reigned supreme. He also plays bass in bands in Seattle;
    meeting other collaborators involves some amount of introductory small talk.

    for being too surface-level, too rote, a throwaway filler conversation. But casual
    chat can be the on-ramp to deeper connection. After all, most of us wouldn’t introduce
    ourselves to a stranger with a question about their biggest fears. Small talk
    is an opportunity to build trust and to learn about others, and to become a more
    curious person, says [Georgie Nightingall](https://www.georgienightingall.co.uk/),
    a conversation specialist and human connectivity researcher. “Being genuinely
    curious, that always helps,” she says. “You can actually realize that you do want

    without moving on to deeper conversation. “One of the key elements of small talk,”

    end up.” Consider all the relationships that began as banter or the [job opportunities

    that most introductory small talk with strangers does in fact go well. As people
    engage in these chats with greater frequency, the more confident they are in their
    abilities to talk to strangers, according to the study. “That’s enough to allow
    you to be in the moment more instead of in panic mode,” Sandstrom says.

- en: 'Popular scripts dominate small talk: comments about traffic and the weather,
    the questions “So, what do you do?” and “How are you?” Often, people give unengaging
    or throwaway answers that don’t give the other person much to respond to. Instead,
    lead with inquiries related to your interests, says [Adam Smiley Poswolsky,](https://www.smileyposwolsky.com/)
    a workplace belonging expert and author of [*Friendship in the Age of Loneliness:

    Consider asking a barista at your neighborhood cafe about their favorite beverage
    or if a friend of a friend at a party has also watched the newest season of *Love
    Is Blind*. If you want to feel a little more prepared, Poswolsky suggests having
    a list of five or so questions at the ready that are topical and feel authentic
    to you — just be sure to refresh your list every few weeks. Maybe your talking
    points include asking if someone has an upcoming vacation or if they tried any
    new restaurants recently.'

  zh: 流行的对话脚本主导着小聊：关于交通和天气的评论，以及“那么，你做什么工作？”和“你好吗？”这些问题。通常，人们给出的答案既不引人入胜，也不给对方太多回应的机会。相反，根据工作场所归属专家、《*孤独时代的友谊：建立连接的乐观指南*》的作者[亚当·斯迈利·波斯沃尔斯基](https://www.smileyposwolsky.com/)建议，首先询问与你兴趣相关的问题。考虑在你居住区的咖啡馆询问咖啡师喜欢的饮料，或者在派对上问一个朋友的朋友是否也看过《*爱情是盲目*》的新季。如果你想要感觉更加准备充分，波斯沃尔斯基建议事先准备一个大约五个问题的列表，这些问题与你感兴趣的话题相关且真实
    —— 只需每隔几周更新你的列表即可。也许你的谈话焦点包括询问别人是否有即将到来的假期，或者最近尝试了哪些新餐厅。
- en: Or instead of questioning your conversation partner, try a statement or observation.
    Something as simple as “This line is taking forever,” or “[Mutual friend’s name]
    makes the best cheese boards,” or “You have the cutest dog I have ever seen” can
    be an effective entrée to small talk. [Research has found](https://myscp.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jcpy.1387)
    that making an observation about a product or item another person has chosen to
    display — like a band T-shirt or a colorful hat — is a better conversation starter
    than discussing the weather. Initiating a chat with someone wearing a shirt from
    your alma mater is easier than attempting to find common ground with nothing to
    go on. “Those conversations tend to go better,” says the study’s lead author,
    [Hillary Wiener](https://www.albany.edu/business/faculty/hillary-wiener), an assistant
    professor of marketing at the University at Albany, “because it’s on something
    that both people involved might actually care about.” The products that were most
    successful at launching a conversation “suggested a point of commonality between
    the asker and the person wearing, using a product,” she says. For example, try
    approaching someone in a Taylor Swift shirt if you too love Taylor Swift or sharing
    a hiking story with someone who is drinking out of a water bottle from Yosemite
    National Park.

    Wiener](https://www.albany.edu/business/faculty/hillary-wiener)，纽约大学市场营销助理教授说，“因为这是两个人可能真正关心的事情。”成功发起对话的产品“暗示了提问者和穿戴或使用产品的人之间的共同点。”例如，试着接近一个穿着泰勒·斯威夫特T恤的人，如果你也喜欢泰勒·斯威夫特，或者与一个喝着优胜美地国家公园水瓶水的人分享一段徒步旅行的故事。

    anecdote, Nightingall says, maybe mentioning a trip you may have taken there.

    conversation partner the wrong way. For small talk with strangers, especially,
    a well-meaning question may not be taken as intended or they may suspect you of
    trying to flirt with them. Small talk is warm and introductory, with no ulterior
    motives. It can surely blossom into a more flirtatious exchange but you should
    lead with curiosity and friendliness. “You can’t realistically be sitting next
    to someone on the plane and say, ‘Hi, what’s your favorite superpower,’” Wiener
    says. “That doesn’t work on a human interaction level.” Starting with an observation
    about how packed the flight is or asking whether the person is traveling for work
    might be more of a context-appropriate introduction.

    Wiener说。“这在人际互动层面上是行不通的。”从观察飞机有多拥挤开始，或者询问对方是不是出差，可能更适合情境的介绍。

    the chitchat if you’re mingling with a stranger on public transit. For talks that
