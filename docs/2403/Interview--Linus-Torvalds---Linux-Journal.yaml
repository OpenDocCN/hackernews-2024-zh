- en: On August 11, while attending LinuxWorld Expo in San Jose, California, I had
    the privilege of having lunch with Linus Torvalds. While we had met briefly before,
    this was the first time I had talked to him face-to-face rather than by e-mail.
    He turned out to be a very personable young man—very self-assured and articulate.
    At his keynote the night before, he had exuded this same calm presence, answering
    questions with aplomb and the confidence that comes from knowing his subject well.
    He surprised me at lunch by admitting to being nervous about public speaking—it
    certainly does not show—so I guess he is human after all! I steered clear of the
    normal topics (Linux and Transmeta), hoping to give you a picture of who exactly
    Linus is. Here's our conversation.

  zh: 在8月11日，我在加州圣何塞参加LinuxWorld Expo时，有幸与Linus Torvalds共进午餐。虽然我们之前有过简短的见面，但这是我第一次与他面对面交谈，而不是通过电子邮件。他是一个非常和蔼的年轻人——非常自信和口才流利。在前一天晚上的主题演讲中，他展现了同样的沉稳气场，从容地回答问题，这种自信来自于对自己专业的了解。午餐时，他坦言对公开演讲感到紧张——尽管完全看不出来——所以我猜他也是个普通人！我避开了常规话题（Linux和Transmeta），希望给你展示一个真实的Linus的形象。以下是我们的对话内容。

    who goes out and searches for stories. She worked for the Finnish newspaper doing
    translations and news graphics. My dad was more of an “out there” radio journalist,
    so he was really excited when the Chechnyan war was going on. So he went there
    and had to wear a bullet-proof vest—he is that kind of person—remember, virile.
    My uncle works for Finnish TV.. My grandfather used to be the Editor in Chief
    of a newspaper. Mainly, the whole family had a kind of book-learning experience.

    an organized religion. Religion is a very strange area. In Finland, nobody cares.
    Many people are religious in Finland, but it''s not a political issue. Over here,
    religion has become politicized, so you have the fringe people in the news. And
    then people are afraid to talk about it because it has political implications,

    University of Technology, which is actually not inside Helsinki but just on the
    border outside. Then there is the real University of Helsinki, which is the kind
    of old-fashioned, European-like university where you have lots of courses like
    philosophy and languages. They do have a technical department, too, but it''s
    not about technology. For example, computer sciences is really computer *science*—it
    talks about complexity analysis and things like that. I went to the real University,
    so I went through all the complexity analysis, what NT completeness means and
    the spherical side. That was kind of fun, and people always wondered why I wasn''t
    at Helsinki University of Technology which is much more engineering-oriented.
    I just liked going—I also liked math, so I fit right in at Helsinki University,
    and at the same time, I had Linux as a side project—the practical side.'

- en: '**Linus**: Spring of 1991—eight and a half years ago. I had taken a course
    in UNIX and C, the fall semester before. The first time I actually touched UNIX
    was fall 1990, when I had a UNIX course at Helsinki University. Actually, it was
    the first UNIX course they ever had at Helsinki University, because it used to
    be a VAX and VMS place. They had just gotten a UNIX machine for trying out that
    newfangled thing, and it turned out to be a huge success. Within a few years,
    they had switched over everything to UNIX. But that first machine was used for
    this small course in UNIX and C, and I immediately felt that this was what I wanted
    to have. It made sense. Then when I bought a PC, I wanted UNIX on it, and the
    rest is kind of history.'

    I mean, if I had to pick anybody it would have to be my granddad. And then maybe
    more of the scientist kind of people, like Einstein, people like him. I thought
    that quantum physics was just the most interesting thing when I was small. But
    then, that was not very personalized—there wasn''t just one person.'

    people to me. He died when I was 15\. He was there mainly during my early school
    years rather than later.'

- en: '**Linus**: No, I never liked that kind of muscle car—the Corvettes, I didn''t
    like. I find those to be uninteresting—a toy car. I like the Miata, but it''s
    too small; however, the BMW Z3—that kind of car—that, I like. But it''s just too
    impractical when you have two kids. We have considered maybe getting a convertible.
    When we moved here, we didn''t think about that, but actually in California it
    does make sense much of the time. But we have to get a four-seater anyway, so
    even then it''s not going to be one of the really “fun” cars; it''s going to be
    one of the practical ones.'

  zh: '**Linus**: 不，我从来不喜欢那种肌肉车 — 柯尔维特，我不喜欢。我觉得那些很无趣 — 玩具车。我喜欢迈阿密，但它太小了；然而，宝马Z3 —
    那种车 — 我喜欢。但是当你有两个孩子时，这种车实在太不实用了。我们考虑过也许买辆敞篷车。我们搬到这里的时候，没有考虑过这一点，但实际上在加利福尼亚大部分时间都是合理的。但无论如何我们都得买四座的，所以即使那样，它也不会是那种真正“有趣”的车；它会是那种实用的车。'
