- en: On August 11, while attending LinuxWorld Expo in San Jose, California, I had
    the privilege of having lunch with Linus Torvalds. While we had met briefly before,
    this was the first time I had talked to him face-to-face rather than by e-mail.
    He turned out to be a very personable young man—very self-assured and articulate.
    At his keynote the night before, he had exuded this same calm presence, answering
    questions with aplomb and the confidence that comes from knowing his subject well.
    He surprised me at lunch by admitting to being nervous about public speaking—it
    certainly does not show—so I guess he is human after all! I steered clear of the
    normal topics (Linux and Transmeta), hoping to give you a picture of who exactly
    Linus is. Here's our conversation.

    You always get combination presents, but it turned out okay for me. It''s a good
    day. In Finland, it is known as the day of “the children without fault”—not exactly
    “without fault”, more “almost perfect”.'

    move around?'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    I was as much of a city kid as you can be in Helsinki. It is not a big city—it
    has half a million people. I basically lived in the central parts of Helsinki
    all my life. I wouldn''t know nature if it jumped out and bit me.'

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Linus**: No, I never did the outdoors thing. Moving out here to Silicon Valley
    was like moving out into the suburbs—very different. I am used to living in a
    five-story building. Here, having a small house with a back yard feels definitely
    rural.'
  prefs: []

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Linus**: No, I mean it''s very different the way people think about living.
    Cities in the U.S. are much more sprawling because people want to live in their
    own houses. European countries are older; most people live in—not skyscrapers—but
    certainly buildings with five, six or seven stories.'

    have one half brother who is nine years younger—he is twenty now. I actually have
    two half brothers in addition to that who are younger than my older daughter.
    My dad is very virile—more virile than is good for him! What can I say?'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    divorced when I was small. I lived with my mother and also my grandparents. My
    mom was a working mother, so I ended up being at my grandparents'' house for a
    large portion of the time—fairly normal years. Probably what happens is you grow
    up to be fairly independent when you come from a family like that.'

  prefs: []

    side—everybody.'

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Linus**: It doesn''t make much of a difference because they are all different
    kinds of journalists. My mom was a translator; she wasn''t the kind of journalist
    who goes out and searches for stories. She worked for the Finnish newspaper doing
    translations and news graphics. My dad was more of an “out there” radio journalist,
    so he was really excited when the Chechnyan war was going on. So he went there
    and had to wear a bullet-proof vest—he is that kind of person—remember, virile.
    My uncle works for Finnish TV.. My grandfather used to be the Editor in Chief
    of a newspaper. Mainly, the whole family had a kind of book-learning experience.
    It was considered good to know English and important to read well. So it was very
    natural to go to university and stuff like that.'

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    know—it was a fairly political family, so I may have reacted against that by being
    non-political. I''m not very interested. I''m much more to the left than the right
    in the U.S. kind of political sense. I''m fairly liberal, but at the same time,
    I really don''t want to go into politics. My parents in the sixties were kind
    of radical people—they have calmed down a lot! They are not political anymore,
    but I grew up in a fairly political environment.'

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Linus**: Hmmm, completely a-religious—atheist. I find that people seem to
    think religion brings morals and appreciation of nature. I actually think it detracts
    from both. It gives people the excuse to say, “Oh, nature was just created”, and
    so the act of creation is seen to be something miraculous. I appreciate the fact
    that, “Wow, it''s incredible that something like this could have happened in the
    first place.” I think we can have morals without getting religion into it, and
    a lot of bad things have come from organized religion in particular. I actually
    fear organized religion because it usually leads to misuses of power.'
  prefs: []

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Linus**: Yeah, and I find it kind of distasteful having religions that tell
    you what you can do and what you can''t do. Catholicism is an example of that
    kind of non-permissiveness, and I think that is very easy to get into if you are
    an organized religion. Religion is a very strange area. In Finland, nobody cares.
    Many people are religious in Finland, but it''s not a political issue. Over here,
    religion has become politicized, so you have the fringe people in the news. And
    then people are afraid to talk about it because it has political implications,
    and that''s usually not true in most of Europe. Religion is a personal matter,
    but does not matter for anything else. That''s how I think it should be done.'

    Majority found out what a large constituency they had, and...'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Linus**: Yeah, it''s kind of ironic that in many European countries, there
    is actually a kind of legal binding between the state and the state religion.
    At the same time, in practice, religion has absolutely nothing to do with everyday
    life. Maybe the taxes to the church, but that''s it. They don''t have any political
    power.'

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Linus**: Actually, in Finland they call it taxes—you pay taxes to the church.
    If you are a member of the church, you pay 2% tax to the church. And that''s the
    amount of legal binding between the church and the state. Apart from that, they
    are completely separate. In the U.S., church and state claim to be very separate,
    but you still see the church has a lot of power in politics.'

    and going to parties and stuff like that. But especially before university, I
    had my own thing, which was computers and that is what I did.'

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    was early enough that you didn''t have computer classes because there weren''t
    enough people who had computers in the early ''80s. I don''t know, not even here
    probably. If you did computers, you mostly did it on your own. Maybe I had one
    or two other people in a class who used computers, and I met them once a week
    to compare notes and stuff like that. I was never into BBSs or anything like that
    or the Internet, either.'

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Linus**: My grandfather on my mother''s side owned one. He was a professor
    of statistics at Helsinki University. He got a computer because, to him, it was
    a programmable calculator. This was a home computer and not a very powerful one,
    but compared to a calculator at the time, it was light-years ahead. He did his
    own programs and had me kind of help him. Although I wasn''t much help, he liked
    having me around. I was typing in programs—stuff like that. He probably wanted
    me to learn, but I didn''t realize that at the time. And I was doing some playing.
    He wasn''t interested in the games. I was reading the manuals that came with the
    computer and doing simple things: typing in example programs and expanding on
    those, like people did. It didn''t start off like, the first day I saw the computer
    I was instantly in love. It was more like, over the years, I just spent a lot
    of time on the computer until it was apparent that it was my hobby.'

    Before you get a driver's license, you can still get a moped. But I always lived
    in the absolute center of Helsinki, so I could walk anywhere, take public transportation
    and whatnot. So I never got into cars or mopeds or anything like that, and I never
    owned a car until I moved here. Most places in Helsinki, a car is more bother
    than it is worth. Unless you need it for some specific reason, like transporting
    a kid. If we had had children then, we probably would have bought a car.

    border outside. Then there is the real University of Helsinki, which is the kind
    of old-fashioned, European-like university where you have lots of courses like
    philosophy and languages. They do have a technical department, too, but it''s
    not about technology. For example, computer sciences is really computer *science*—it
    talks about complexity analysis and things like that. I went to the real University,
    so I went through all the complexity analysis, what NT completeness means and
    the spherical side. That was kind of fun, and people always wondered why I wasn''t
    at Helsinki University of Technology which is much more engineering-oriented.
    I just liked going—I also liked math, so I fit right in at Helsinki University,
    and at the same time, I had Linux as a side project—the practical side.'

    in UNIX and C, the fall semester before. The first time I actually touched UNIX
    was fall 1990, when I had a UNIX course at Helsinki University. Actually, it was
    the first UNIX course they ever had at Helsinki University, because it used to
    be a VAX and VMS place. They had just gotten a UNIX machine for trying out that
    newfangled thing, and it turned out to be a huge success. Within a few years,
    they had switched over everything to UNIX. But that first machine was used for
    this small course in UNIX and C, and I immediately felt that this was what I wanted
    to have. It made sense. Then when I bought a PC, I wanted UNIX on it, and the
    rest is kind of history.'

    are essentially free, and you get subsidies from the government to study. So you
    can actually live on that subsidy, even though you won''t be living well. I was
    also teaching at the university, being a T.A. at first, and then a junior research
    assistant, then a junior research person—slowly moving up the ranks. By the time
    I was starting to get my degree, I had long since realized that I actually didn''t
    like writing papers. I had a hard time writing my thesis, and I decided I couldn''t
    stay at the university forever. Because if you don''t like writing papers, then
    you really don''t want to stay at a university. So, that''s when I said, “Okay”,
    and started thinking about something else, and the result was moving to the U.S.'

    By the time I came in for the second day of interviews, I had just decided that,
    “Hey, if I wanted to work for a place that did something exciting, it had better
    be a bit crazy!” Nobody else was doing anything as exciting. At Transmeta, I had
    the feeling that, “Okay, this is a company that is doing something nobody else
    in the world is doing.” And I still think that. Even though I can''t say *what*
    it is, Transmeta is still a good company to work for. You feel that, hey, we''re

    that they are associated with scientology anywhere in their literature. And that
    kind of makes me nervous. I don''t want to put my child in a scientology school
    by mistake. We have Patricia enrolled in a school with a good name in the area,

    nobody worries about school, nobody even thinks about it because it's obvious
    that you go to public school. People who don't send their kids to public school
    have some particular reason, like their kid needs special attention. There are
    a few private schools that specialize in languages and stuff like that, but it
    is uncommon for kids to go to those—normal people usually don't do that. Here,
    you have to really think about the issue. There are a lot of bad schools and a
    lot of really good schools—it's more of a decision. Just that difference made
    us nervous, so we will see.

    parks during the week. On weekends, we sometimes go to a small petting zoo close
    by; we are members, so we get in free. Sometimes we go to these natural reserve
    areas and just walk. Most of the time, we just stay home and go shopping and stuff
    like that.'

    better than non-technical mail. They are much easier! You can glance and tell
    it''s important and put it aside or handle it on the spot, and that is a fairly
    straightforward decision to make. But for non-technical e-mail, you say, “Hmmm...what
    should I do about this?” You don''t have time to decide and handle it right then,
    so you just put it aside and forget about it.'

    I mean, if I had to pick anybody it would have to be my granddad. And then maybe
    more of the scientist kind of people, like Einstein, people like him. I thought
    that quantum physics was just the most interesting thing when I was small. But
    then, that was not very personalized—there wasn''t just one person.'

    necessarily there mentally! But at the same time, he was probably one of the closest
    people to me. He died when I was 15\. He was there mainly during my early school
    years rather than later.'

    a minivan. Yes, it''s not the sexy sports car. We''re getting a lot of friends
    and family over from Finland and whenever we go somewhere, we have to take two
    cars and that is just a pain. So we are getting to be a “real American family”,
    and we will have a minivan. But that was not the answer you were looking for!'

    like. I find those to be uninteresting—a toy car. I like the Miata, but it''s
    too small; however, the BMW Z3—that kind of car—that, I like. But it''s just too
    impractical when you have two kids. We have considered maybe getting a convertible.
    When we moved here, we didn''t think about that, but actually in California it
    does make sense much of the time. But we have to get a four-seater anyway, so
    even then it''s not going to be one of the really “fun” cars; it''s going to be
    one of the practical ones.'

    have to be careful—blue is safer.'
