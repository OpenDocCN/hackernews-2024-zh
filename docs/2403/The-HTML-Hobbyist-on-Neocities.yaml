    long, long time. I’ve used Mosaic and watched the rise of Netscape Navigator.
    I learned JavaScript when all it could do was stupid browser tricks and DHTML
    was cutting-edge. I’m a veteran of the Browser Wars. I was recently hit with [a
    mighty powerful wave of nostalgia](https://journal.lilly.art/world-wide-web-nostalgia/):
    I miss ye olde World Wide Web. I miss the unadulterated optimism that we had for
    Cyberspace. I miss the seriousness about silliness and the silliness about seriousness
    that we found on the ’Net. I miss the infinite variety that we found in our pre-mobile
    Matrix analog. I miss the 1,000 different fanzines. [I want it all back](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzEgPbd0hfo).'

    other in boring, spied-on gated communities, and are given generic templates which
    define what people are supposed to know about each other. It’s time we took back
    our personalities from these sterilized, lifeless, monetized, monitored entities
    and let our creativity flourish again.

    is capable of, so that I can provide guidance and advice via [The HTML Hobbyist](https://www.htmlhobbyist.com/)
    to people who want to make websites. *Kudos to the creators.*
