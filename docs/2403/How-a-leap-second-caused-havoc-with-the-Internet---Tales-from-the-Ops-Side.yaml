    puzzle. This puzzle went beyond technical challenges and forced him to think deeply
    about the ripple effects space and time have on Ops, and the Earth itself.'

    At first, Hany thought it might be an attack, but this didn’t make sense because
    other sites seemed to be operational. Even odder, several systems reported a high
    load. While an increase in workload isn’t uncommon for a single customer, simultaneous
    upticks across systems are unusual.

    phone, TV, and radio all acting up in the same way, even though they are different
    devices. What link did these seemingly disconnected systems share?

    clocks around the world that day.

    we know – about time. A leap second is “an extra second occasionally applied to
    accommodate the difference between precise time and imprecise observed time.”

- en: 'Diving into the source code of Linux, Hany discovered that five years prior,
    someone in the Linux community flagged a potential issue with its leap second
    implementation. A deadlock, or a computer freeze, could occur. To fix this, a
    single line of code was changed. A comment was left behind with this change to
    note one seemingly small caveat: “The only possible side effect of this removal
    might be that the timer fires one second too late after a leap second.’ Scarily,
    this side effect is what took down large portions of the Internet in 2012.'

  zh: 在深入研究Linux源代码时，Hany发现五年前，Linux社区中有人标记了其闰秒实现的潜在问题。可能会出现死锁或计算机冻结的情况。为了修复此问题，只改变了一行代码。在这次更改中留下了一条注释来记录一个看似小的警告：“这种移除可能唯一的副作用是计时器在闰秒后触发稍晚。”
    令人不安的是，这个副作用导致了2012年互联网的大面积崩溃。
