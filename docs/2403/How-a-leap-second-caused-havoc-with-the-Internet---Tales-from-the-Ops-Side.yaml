    puzzle. This puzzle went beyond technical challenges and forced him to think deeply
    about the ripple effects space and time have on Ops, and the Earth itself.'

- en: Without warning, on a summer evening in June 2012, multiple sites went down.
    At first, Hany thought it might be an attack, but this didn’t make sense because
    other sites seemed to be operational. Even odder, several systems reported a high
    load. While an increase in workload isn’t uncommon for a single customer, simultaneous
    upticks across systems are unusual.

    a high load, I would expect it to be sluggish.”

- en: Several different technologies, such as MySQL, Ruby, and Java, sharing nothing
    in common, all experienced the same symptoms. Hany compares the puzzle to someone’s
    phone, TV, and radio all acting up in the same way, even though they are different
    devices. What link did these seemingly disconnected systems share?

- en: Hany didn’t understand why these systems were all obsessed with the time. Turning
    to the Internet, he discovered something highly unusual and fascinating! An extra
    [leap second](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leap_second) had just been added to
    clocks around the world that day.

    a last-ditch effort he tried the “universal fix to all things tech: turning it
    off and on.”'

    was back up and running as if nothing out of the ordinary had even happened.

    digging. He soon discovered that Reddit, Mozilla, and even airlines had been impacted.

    we know – about time. A leap second is “an extra second occasionally applied to
    accommodate the difference between precise time and imprecise observed time.”

    take into account inconsistencies in the Earth’s rotation.

- en: 'Hany explains: “Due to physics, at certain times of the year, the Earth moves
    faster along its orbit than others. How do we base time off of this, then?” It
    turns out that we don’t.'

- en: In addition to some days being longer than others based on these inconsistencies,
    major events, such as earthquakes, can also speed up the earth’s rotation. Even
    human-made structures have the ability to affect time.

    has increased the length of the day by 0.06 microseconds,” notes Hany.

- en: Clocks are based on Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), which operates as a kind
    of go-between for precise and imprecise time. Usually, leap seconds are announced
    with about six months’ notice. But how could this increase in time affect Ops?

- en: “The problem with leap seconds is everyone has a different way of implementing
    it. For Linux systems, which is what we use, as well as a large portion of the
    Internet, the day can only ever have 86,400 seconds.”

- en: 'Diving into the source code of Linux, Hany discovered that five years prior,
    someone in the Linux community flagged a potential issue with its leap second
    implementation. A deadlock, or a computer freeze, could occur. To fix this, a
    single line of code was changed. A comment was left behind with this change to
    note one seemingly small caveat: “The only possible side effect of this removal
    might be that the timer fires one second too late after a leap second.’ Scarily,
    this side effect is what took down large portions of the Internet in 2012.'
