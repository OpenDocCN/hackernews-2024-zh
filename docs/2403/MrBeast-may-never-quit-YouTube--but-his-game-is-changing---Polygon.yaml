    on X (formerly Twitter)](https://twitter.com/DramaAlert/status/1698131769810128985?)
    saw Irish YouTube entertainer Seán “Jacksepticeye” McLoughlin strapped to a lie
    detector test. His friends were grilling him about everything, like whether or
    not he still enjoyed his job as a YouTuber and how much money he had in the bank.
    Though sensitive, none of the questions fazed McLoughlin, a video star with millions
    of subscribers on YouTube. To truly rattle him, his friends had to pull out the
    big guns — questions that, if answered honestly, would make most squirm. Has YouTube
    gotten worse as a platform, they probed? Yes, McLoughlin answered, still not missing
    a beat. And he said Jimmy “MrBeast” Donaldson, YouTube’s biggest creator, was
    to blame.

    a reputation for generous stunts that give ordinary people cars, houses, and thousands
    of dollars, many think of MrBeast as a kind of philanthropic figure, representing
    some of the best YouTube has to offer. His branding is at once self-aggrandizing
    yet selfless; [on podcasts he frequently reminds](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=mrbeast+interview)
    his 241 million subscribers (at the time of publication) that he’s at the top
    precisely because all he ever does is YouTube, and all he wants to do is entertain
    people. He [lives in his own recording studio](https://www.insider.com/photos-inside-mrbeasts-14-million-top-secret-filming-studio-2023-5#donaldson-lives-in-a-humble-apartment-tucked-away-inside-the-studio-4).
    While his free time seems minuscule, the rare times he does pull away from work
    are for dates with his girlfriend that center around activities that could enrich
    his videos, because he considers a single hour of a date [to be worth $100K](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F73I47u1iQU)
    had it been dedicated to work instead.

    — back into doing YouTube videos is practically lore. There’s little regard for
    personal profit, [or so he says](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5YW4JB07-8).
    He tells viewers that while he employs a sizable percentage of his hometown, he
    still lives modestly, unlike other rich YouTubers. A segment of his fortune goes
    toward philanthropy, and in many of his videos he finds a way to give people valuables.
    Viewers dream of running into MrBeast and his oodles of cash. Creators, meanwhile,
    can only imagine what it’s like to have the sort of audience reach and clout MrBeast
    does. He [builds wells in Africa](https://www.cnn.com/2023/11/06/africa/mrbeast-100-wells-africa-intl-scli/index.html),
    man — how could anyone have anything bad to say about MrBeast? Who would dare,
    even, to say something negative and risk their own business in an industry as
    small and collaborative as YouTube? And so, the internet came down on McLoughlin.

    [top creators with millions of subscribers came to MrBeast’s defense](https://twitter.com/Dexerto/status/1698173864088354879).
    There was incredulity, there was indignity. Nobody would say such a thing unless
    they were jealous or out of their mind, the replies suggested. But McLoughlin
    seemed to be in a fair state of mind, based on his explanation. And by virtue
    of having been on YouTube as Jacksepticeye for years up to that point, he was
    inherently an authority on how the platform has changed. In the Q&A video, McLoughlin
    says that MrBeast made YouTube worse by shifting the focus to be “more about views,
    money, and popularity” over having fun. If it wasn’t superficial, McLoughlin argued,
    MrBeast’s videos would be longer — and we’d see more of him having a good time.

    through the heart of YouTube. This tension has only grown more visible as MrBeast’s
    content has started dominating the platform, signaling a paradigm shift. As YouTube
    strategist [Zackary Smigel explored in a recent video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ikEfScuLQ2Y),
    we’ve seen distinct eras start and end on the platform. At first, YouTube prized
    authenticity, and the prototypical creator was likely recording out of their bedroom
    on an iPhone. Once real money came into the picture, the same creators who built
    the platform became brands who made a living off of their popularity. The camera-ready
    Smosh you see today, whose goofs blew up in the advent of curated social media
    presences on platforms like Instagram, is very different from the amateur duo
    who started the channel back in 2005, for example.

    consider the platform’s current phase synonymous with Donaldson. You see his influence
    everywhere, in the types of boisterous content people make, the brisk editing
    styles populating all of YouTube’s trending content, and even in the way YouTubers
    style their video thumbnails. Up until recently, MrBeast had the biggest video
    on the platform. Rare is the video that doesn’t take cues from MrBeast’s signature
    and endlessly memeable reaction face. As far as detractors like McLoughlin are
    concerned, MrBeast copycats are a plague on YouTube. And even if they do wholly
    original content, by and large, the most visible creators on the platform produce
    videos that mimic the extremes of someone who is willing to spend millions on
    a shoot.

    do not get uploaded unless they clear a bar set by the YouTube algorithm. In a

    “given up” 14 years of his life to something if he “wasn’t having fun,” Donaldson
    also acknowledges the hardship of the work. Specifically, he frames it as a form
    of self-improvement — which has allowed him to evade tough questions. In interviews,
    Donaldson candidly reveals the tough conditions that make his videos possible,
    like building a friend group that constantly criticizes his output and axing expensive,
    fully finished videos that he’s unsure about. But because he’s rich and famous,
    no matter how rocky it gets, his road is seen as aspirational.

    around his own expertise, and how it allows him to game the platform. He’s described
    spending countless hours obsessing over every detail, [down to the optimal brightness
    of a YouTube thumbnail](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/cLGM_rd6qaA). He knows
    the first 10 seconds of a video are the most important for retention, which is
    why his videos start with a barrage of all the wild things that will unfold in
    its run time. And that signature MrBeast editing style that’s fast, frantic, and
    omnipresent on YouTube is a relentless gambit for your attention. “I can get 100
    million views on a video for less than 10 grand if I wanted to,” Donaldson boasted
    on the [Colin and Samir podcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IQ_ldV9z_A&t=1276s).

    on achieving virality that he will not upload a video unless he thinks it’ll go
    big. Later on in the same [podcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IQ_ldV9z_A),
    he muses that if he fed all the information about his MrBeast videos to an AI
    and prompted it to tell him what to make next, the output would be what he’s already
    making.

    YouTube is the product](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8VcUnz3nVc) of radical
    candor within a team of like-minded creators with similar perfectionist standards.
    To this day, Donaldson claims to get on daily calls with other creators in the
    hopes of learning something new that will help him stay at the top. He claims
    that if a creator’s circle of friends doesn’t spot room for improvement in the
    videos — even if they’re already viral — then the creator is doomed to stagnate
    on the platform. Critique can only improve your output, he suggested at the time.
    But clearly he didn’t feel the same about McLoughlin’s comments, even if his YouTuber
    contemporary was on to something.

    erased himself as a person from his episodic output. If viewers don’t really see
    him having fun, that’s by design. Donaldson [has outright said he sees “personality”
    as a limitation for growth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8VcUnz3nVc), once
    noting in a podcast that hinging your content on who you are as a person means
    risking not being liked. And if someone doesn’t like a creator as a person, they
    may not give the videos a chance.

    see MrBeast having fun in his videos because he’s not actually having a good time.
    In podcasts, Donaldson tells hosts that he goes so hard, he won’t stop working
    until he burns out and isn’t able to do anything at all. With a laugh, he admits
    that he has a mental breakdown “[every other week](https://www.wnct.com/news/mrbeast/mrbeast-says-he-has-a-mental-breakdown-every-other-week/).”
    If he ever stops for a breather, he says, he gets depressed. MrBeast is so laser-focused
    on generating content on YouTube that he describes his personality *as* “YouTube.”
    He acknowledges that this brutal approach to videos, which [has cratered many
    creators over the years](https://www.polygon.com/2018/6/1/17413542/burnout-mental-health-awareness-youtube-elle-mills-el-rubius-bobby-burns-pewdiepie),

    videos are so expensive, with budgets in the millions, that he can barely afford
    them. The main channel [often operates at a loss](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5YW4JB07-8),
    which is part of why his business has expanded to include food items that can
    be bought multiple times — and therefore have a higher profit margin. But from
    the very start of his career as a YouTuber, MrBeast’s funds come from sponsorship
    brands who are happy to drop cash for a viral video that covertly acts as advertisement.
    Though he’s been under scrutiny for his part in the warping of YouTube as a content
    ecosystem, you will never see something outwardly controversial or offensive in
    a MrBeast video. For a long time, Donaldson admits in a number of podcast appearances,
    he was afraid of putting anything complex in his videos — *what if a viewer didn’t
    get it and stopped watching?* Donaldson might very well be an advertiser’s absolute
    dream, the logical endpoint of an internet that’s been flattened into a samey,
    straightforward sludge of optimized content.

    but the next era might already be upon us. If the old YouTube was Instagram, the
    new YouTube will be more like TikTok. That manifests in literal ways, with the
    company putting much of its energy into “shorts,” but also figuratively, beyond
    structural elements. TikTok’s strength lies in its ability to surface videos from
    everyday users to an enormous audience, and it’s so good at doing this that people
    talk about its algorithm in mystical terms. Meanwhile, trust in media establishments
    continues to decline, while [more and more Americans are turning to TikTok for

    they can detect as human to deliver their content. It’s the very thing YouTube
    once did best, once the internet moved past the supremacy of blogs. “We are seeing
    many creators blow up right now because they’re creating good content while maintaining
    their relatability,” Smigel says. Spending a million dollars on a hotel room,
    as MrBeast did in a recent video, during a period where some can’t afford basic
    necessities and numerous industries fight for better working conditions, isn’t
    exactly relatable. Ostentatious influencers like the Kardashians are already experiencing
    the consequences of this shift within the public eye, but the changing attitudes
    of the broader viewership will likely hit YouTube’s elite.

    that the incoming class of creators will reach his same viewership. Monoculture
    of that sort is a vanishing rarity, nor a marker of quality. MrBeast isn’t the
    best YouTube has to offer; he’s just made that rhetoric his brand. Other self-interested
    creators have a stake in perpetuating the narrative that a bigger number is inherently
    better. The better the numbers, the better the revenue — and numbers are easier
    to figure out than trying to assess or assign a value to art. But the most influential
    YouTubers of the next era already don’t resemble the prototypical MrBeast video.

    say that he’s been trying new things with his videos — things that, a year ago,
    might’ve sounded sacrilegious in a MrBeast video. He’s screaming less, and messing
    around with his friends way more. The videos are slower, and by extension, feature
    a longer run time than his older videos. He’s including sillier material, even
    if it doesn’t seem pertinent to the video. To Donaldson, these changes are all
    a part of his newfound focus on producing material with better stories. His theory,
    which he’s been talking about for over a year now on podcasts, is that good storytelling
    will take his videos to the next level. But good stories are about people, not
    brands — that’s advertising.

    aren’t hiring hitmen to track them down, or blowing millions on making a bank
    explode. But the next era of YouTube seems to be bending a superstar toward its

    they might be. Rather than squeezing in a quick preview of the most sensational
    moments of his video at the start, as he usually does, Donaldson lingers on his
    subject a smidge more. An evolution, even if it’s all in the details, is underway.'
