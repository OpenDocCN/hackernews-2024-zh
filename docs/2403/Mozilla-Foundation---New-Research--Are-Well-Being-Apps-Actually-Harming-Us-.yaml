    happier, more productive, and less depressed — many of which are offered by employers
    as a “health perk.” In just a tap or two, employees can meditate, be more mindful,
    and think more positively.'

    most popular digital mental well-being apps — like Calm, Headspace, and Insight
    Timer — tracking their content and psychological methodologies. They then shared
    their findings with a diverse set of mental health and technology experts: psychologists,
    psychology scholars and thinkers, Buddhist practitioners, cognitive scientists,
    and AI experts.'

- en: The lessons learned? Despite ostensibly *helping* vulnerable workers, these
    apps frequently *harm* them in three key ways. They promote unrealistic expectations;
    they shift the responsibility for maintaining a healthy workplace away from the
    employer and toward the employee; and they amplify harmful mentalities such as
    performative positivity. (See more on each of these findings below.)

    about this phenomenon, and to create a generative meditation that highlights these
    apps’ platitudes.

    co-creator of Well-being Struggle:** “Despite employers’ and tech companies’ protest
    to the contrary, mental well-being in a workplace is not something that can be
    solved just with an app. This project questions who really benefits from these
    apps. Indeed, the apps — and many other AI-powered ‘tools’ — prioritize design
    principles like consumption and productivity, not actual well-being.”'

    artist and co-creator of Well-being Struggle:** “Many of these apps stigmatize
    negative emotions, rather than helping people manage them. Unfortunately, while
    this approach harms individuals, it’s also quite lucrative: the market for employee
    wellness tools and resources is expected to reach $109 billion by 2030.”'
