    have begun to question why their cities are so bad. Urbanists have provided many
    compelling answers, and have gone further to propose how we might make our cities
    more affordable, dynamic, and resilient. As a result, urbanism is winning converts
    across the country.

    streets, to specific interventions like [the abolition of single family zoning.](https://www.amazon.com/Arbitrary-Lines-Zoning-Broke-American/dp/1642832545)
    Many are tempted to believe, however, that one silver bullet policy of their choosing–whether
    that be repealing parking minimums, allowing for more single-stairway buildings,
    investing more in public transit, and so on–can solve the many problems plaguing
    our cities. But no single intervention can solve something so complex and politically
    fraught. The solutions must be as comprehensive as the scale of the challenge.

    have ignored the importance of finance in charting a different course for the
    future. Without credit markets that can actually finance the creation of new housing,
    very little can get built. Without flexible credit markets, very little good can
    get built.  This particularly impacts small developers, and by extension the quality
    of our communities overall. Small builders imbue identity, intrigue, and charm
    into the places they work, and confer significant quantitative benefits like providing
    housing typologies that larger firms might not be willing or able to build, and
    offering it at attainable pricing.

    with the inherently challenging process of real estate development. This risk
    mitigation is critical to understanding why our world looks the way it does. Finally,
    we’ll dive into how America’s housing finance system is leading to negative consequences,
    privileging large scale institutional development at the expense of more incremental,
    community based building, and why we should work to support more of the latter.

    it''s an office block, apartment building, hospital, indoor ski lift, school,
    or strip mall, the costs can be substantial. Few individuals or institutions have
    enough money lying around to cover all of the expenses. Even if they do, it often
    makes more sense to use debt to leverage their equity proceeds further. For instance,

    using debt enjoys significantly higher returns relative to the one who only used
    equity. As the scale increases, so does the divergence in returns. While the first
    builder can only construct one home with a $1,000,000 equity investment, the second
    can build four. Said another way, a $1,000,000 investment yields a $300,000 profit
    for the first builder, while the same initial investment nets the second home
    builder $1.2 million. Factors like coordinating different crews across 4 different
    buildings, variable construction costs, sale prices, and interest rates may complicate
    this simplistic math, but in theory, it underscores the power of leverage. If
    one can make more money from the same amount of money (or less), it makes rational
    sense to do so.

    project, but obtaining it is not a straightforward process. That’s because construction,
    in addition to being expensive, is very risky. There are a hundred things that
    can go wrong. A dozen usually do, and that’s only if you're lucky. That’s a problem
    for more reasons than one. Traditional banks, the primary lenders in the construction
    markets, aren't in the risk business. They're in the risk management business.
    If they're going to extend a loan, they want to make sure that they can take as
    much risk off the table as possible.

    used to assess a project's viability. Arguably the most important metric is the
    Debt Service Coverage Ratio, which calculates how much net operating income (NOI)
    a property generates compared to the amount of stabilized debt it has. Ideally
    this exceeds 1.2 (where a property has 20% more NOI than debt). The Debt Yield
    is another important metric. It looks at NOI as a percentage of the total stabilized
    loan amount. Typically, lenders want this number to be more than 10%, or for a
    property with a $1,000,000 loan to have at least $100,000 of NOI.

- en: Second, lenders are cautious about the size of the loans they offer as they
    want to avoid being overexposed to projects that might go south. Banks in the
    US today rarely extend credit instruments with a Loan-to-Cost (LTC) ratio greater
    than 75%. Depending on the macroeconomic situation, the size of the development,
    and the quality of the borrower, some developers may struggle to finance more
    than 50% of their hard and soft costs from one lender. This prompts them to either
    put up a larger amount of equity (reducing their returns) or seek alternative
    bridge financing to reach 65-70% LTC, albeit with higher interest rates.

    terms of the contract, the bank can seize the asset. Though not a simple process,
    it’s rather straightforward. Through foreclosure, the lender will try to recover
    the balance of the debt they issued, sometimes making a small profit, sometimes
    losing a little bit.
  id: totrans-split-26

    is take over a project midway through. They're not developers, after all. **Collateral
    of a bad asset isn’t worth very much. And half-finished buildings are pretty bad
    assets**. Half-finished structures, initially designed by a team no longer involved
    in the project, may have limited market appeal, especially if the plans were unconventional.
    This team may have cut corners as well, but that’s difficult to know unless a
    comprehensive diagnostic is carried out, which is expensive and time consuming.
    One hopes nothing will be found, but chances are that if a project went bust halfway
    through, things were not on the up and up. In the case where changing market conditions
    made the continuance of the project infeasible, whether due to rising costs or
    diminished demand for the final project, there may be no buyers for a stalled
    out construction site.

    receive all of their principal back, and they certainly won’t be getting any interest
    payments, which is their core business model. If a bank issues a $6 million loan
    on a deal, and the sponsor walks away from it, the bank faces two choices. The
    first is to wait for someone to acquire the project for its debt basis, which
    could take a while. The second, less favorable option, would be to market the
    project for its land basis as some other form of development. This would be a
    matter of last resort, as the land may only be worth $1 million on a project of
    this scale. Given the headaches associated with demolishing whatever was built,
    it might trade for even less than this. Staring down a $5 million loss, lenders
    may opt to sit on the asset until the market turns around. You can imagine how
    precarious these things get when a couple of zeros are factored in. But the hope
    of salvation tomorrow is far more enticing than dealing with the reality of today.

    development project.* It’s risky, difficult, and requires a highly specialized
    skill set. Banks don’t fully know who will be able to execute at the onset of
    a project. The best they can do is to work with developers who have a long established
    track record. Even this is no guarantee of success. But it erects a fairly sizable
    barrier to entry for smaller, younger, or unproven outfits who don’t have any
    track record to speak of, to say nothing of a proven one. A catch-22 materializes.
    The only way to get financing from a bank is to have done projects before, but
    the only way to have done projects before is to have gotten support from a bank
    previously. It’s very difficult to enter this loop without having already been
    in it. It’s sort of like how employers ask for a year of work experience for a
    job that’s only courting recent graduates. How can you have a year of experience
    if no one is willing to give you the year of experience you require, because you
    don’t have a year of experience?

    support a project. However, perhaps more important than simply having enough funds

    the bank with the prospect of recovering their investment in the event of project
    failure.

    by one’s personal assets or a balance sheet. If the bank can’t recoup what’s owed
    to them through foreclosure, they can go after assets pledged as a part of the
    PG. This is where things can get really dangerous for less experienced developers.
    Depending on the terms of a PG, the bank can garnish wages, liquidate pledged
    assets, and pretty much make the developer’s life miserable in myriad novel and
    terrifying ways. Mitigating actions like shielding ownership in an LLC to protect
    external assets can be taken, but it adds a few layers of sophistication that
    new builders might not know how to navigate. Naturally, with barriers so high,

    construction seems to be due to labor costs. This could be due to a few things.
    After the Great Financial Crisis, many construction workers left the industry
    and didn’t return, [leading to a severe labor shortage](https://www.abc.org/News-Media/News-Releases/construction-workforce-shortage-tops-half-a-million-in-2023-says-abc).
    Those who remained could command much higher wages owing to their relative scarcity.
    Secondly, if more of the companies building housing are publicly traded home builders
    or institutionally backed multi-family firms, they can’t take advantage of the
    cheaper labor that smaller builders have access to, namely unlicensed, undocumented,
    or less sophisticated crews. This doesn’t mean that smaller builders are cutting

    This leads to compressed cap rates and higher valuations on top of the already
    increased cash flow, compounding the raw advantages of leasing to a multi-national
    chain over a local operator. What rational actor with obligations to their investors
    could turn down such a proposition? [This same math bears out across salons, banks,

    the current structure of development finance limits the amount of housing that
    can be built. Zoning codes, along with other land use regulations like floor area
    ratios (FAR), dwelling unit restrictions per acre, setback requirements, maximum
    lot coverage ratios, and minimum parking ratios, restrict the total number of
    units that can be built on any given lot. There are only so many parcels that
    can be acquired, or aggregated, that legally allow several hundred-unit large
    buildings. For example, if a 20,000 square foot (roughly half an acre) has an
    FAR of 0.5, only 10,000 square feet of buildable area will be permitted. Good
    luck getting much more than 20 units in a building this size. While rezonings
    and land use code revisions may increase housing allowances, achieving the necessary
    density for institutionally backed firms is unlikely to happen on a majority of
    lots.

    in the city, which take up [roughly 38% of the land](https://www.sfchronicle.com/sf/article/sf-map-single-family-homes-17699820.php).
    If just 20% of these lots, or 7% of the city’s land, were redeveloped to allow
    4 unit buildings, 73,683 net new homes could be realized, housing at least 155,000
    people (based on the city’s current household size of [2.11 people per dwelling
    unit](https://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/household-size-18108733.php)).
    At 10 units per building (possible with 3-5 story structures depending on the
    lot dimensions), more than 220,000 net new homes could be created, housing 466,000
    people. Those homes would accommodate more than half of the current population

    development. Economies of scale can only be leveraged so far when the cost of
    elevators, double loaded corridors, large parking garages, and de rigueur amenity
    spaces are factored in. If a certain rent threshold cannot be achieved in one
    of these large new buildings (which almost always must be at the top of the market,
    owing to the return imperatives of these firms and the high costs of construction),
    these buildings won’t get built, further worsening our housing crisis.

    not. Their fundamental nature as risk mitigation machines won't change. Metrics
    like DSCR, Debt Yield, and the creditworthiness of borrowers are essential to
    their ability to perform this mitigation. While there may be smaller customers
    who grow to become larger clients one day, many won’t make it there, and banks
    don’t exactly want to bet on the few who will survive. This isn’t to say traditional
    lenders aren’t willing to extend some level of risk, but it falls short of solving
    the challenge at a meaningful scale. As has been explored, the risk and effort
    associated with small loans are simply not worth it for the banks. While a lender
    might be comfortable underwriting a duplex, introduce complexities like a ground
    floor commercial unit with an ADU in the back of the lot, and it might be a better
    use of everyone’s time to burn the mortgage contract before it’s even signed.

    building, the absence of a secondary market for these sorts of non-conforming
    loans is a significant structural obstacle. The majority of mortgages are sold
    on the secondary market, which allows banks to export their risk to someone else.
    That risk can only be exported, however, if there’s Federal support. *But Fannie
    Mae and Freddie Mac don’t provide the backstopping lenders require to get comfortable
    with issuing these sorts of products,* meaning traditional lenders must hold these
    loans on their balance sheets if they want to offer them. This is, you guessed
    it, too risky for most banks to contemplate. Better to stick with what’s proven.
    Currently, around [80% of federal loans and guarantees support single-family homes.](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/53dd6676e4b0fedfbc26ea91/t/56c4e43cab48de9641559379/1455744066769/rpa-the-unintended-consequences-of-housing-finance__final.pdf)

    While a large developer may easily be able to deposit $1,000,000 into a bank account
    to satisfy the lender’s reserve ratios, a small developer may struggle to put
    anything in the bank. Sorry, out of luck. Large firms increasing their share of
    the overall banking market is also a threat, as the sorts of smaller, local lenders
    who understand the merits of small developments get wiped out. And I don’t see

    We've been developing housing for the better part of 3 years and have little to

    I’ve reconciled this (as much as one can) with the fulfillment that comes with
    the pursuit of creating great places. But fulfillment doesn’t put food on the

    issues the loan in the first place, they’re in a very favorable position to execute
    on a half-finished project should something go wrong. There are obvious conflicts
    of interest here, as the developer who issues the loan could use predatory tactics
    to wring out a lot of interest and then take over the deal at a significantly
    reduced basis. In circumstances like this, it’s crucial for the borrower to scrutinize
    operating agreements and loan documents to make sure they’re not being played
    for a fool. If and when this is resolved, this relationship can be mutually beneficial.
    The senior developer can lend not just construction proceeds, but experience and
    guidance on what pitfalls to avoid. The junior developer can trade long days on
    the job site for the equity and support of the senior partner, who also gets an
    opportunity to nurture a promising green talent who may shape their city in unknown
    but wonderful ways. This relationship may flower, with the two entering into a
    more formal joint venture partnership with one another. This is a pathway I’m

    A non-profit fund fueled by tax-deductible donations would be ineligible for returns,
    and could thus offer highly favorable construction loan terms. With administrative
    costs kept in check (no easy thing), the fund could be robustly managed while
    only charging 1 point in origination fees to borrowers, and perhaps 2% in interest
    rates, resulting in an annual administrative operating budget of $150 million.
    If the average loan size were $1 million, 5,000 projects a year could be financed.
    Each project would incur $30,000 in administrative costs. One internal project/loan
    manager could likely oversee 15, 20, or 30 projects a year, depending on the level
    of involvement required. If the fund needed to take over from a struggling developer,
    this number would of course drop, and relative administrative costs would rise.

    affordable threshold of Area Median Income (AMI). Perhaps 80%. This will be more
    or less viable depending on the market. In more expensive metros, the fund might
    act as a stabilization lender, where small developers pay higher construction
    rates to a private lender, but refinance into a permanent loan with 2 or 3% interest
    rates. Not every deal will pencil under these metrics, but many more would be
    unlocked.
