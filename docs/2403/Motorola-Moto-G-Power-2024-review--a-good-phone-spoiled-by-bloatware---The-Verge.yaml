- en: There are some phones that just feel nice to pick up, and the 2024 Moto G Power
    is one of them. It’s sitting on my desk and even though I don’t need to do anything
    with it right now, I pick it up anyway. That soft-touch back! The flat-yet-slightly-contoured
    edges! I turn it to look at the headphone jack on the bottom edge, just to remind
    myself if it’s there. If the battery is even a little low, I set it on my wireless
    charging stand just for the thrill. All this on a $300 phone! Imagine!

    back down to reality. The LCD panel isn’t as nice and contrast-y as an OLED (that’s
    forgivable). The camera is underwhelming and suffers from Motorola’s unusual image
    processing tendencies (less forgivable). But again, this is a $300 phone in a
    world where $1,000 is the standard going rate for a top-tier flagship. Much can
    be forgiven!

    “folders.” They are not folders; they are apps. [I first encountered them](/23800535/motorola-g-stylus-5g-2023-review-battery-camera-bloatware-swish-apps)
    on last year’s Moto G Stylus 5G, and I hate them very much.

    each of these apps acts as a little hub. Icons for apps that you have legitimately
    downloaded will appear in the corresponding “folder.” You’ll also find tons of
    other suggested apps to download — pages and pages of them! Apps as far as the
    eye can see!

    In the shopping app, it invites you to “Unlock the power of shopping” with links
    to buy stuff like kitschy Easter decor from TJ Maxx. Mercifully, there’sa toggle
    to hide this section.

    any of them during the setup process. You *can* (and should!) opt out of downloading
    a third-party lock screen from a different service called Glance.

    weather app is festooned with ads and even more suggested apps, plus pithy insights
    like “Gotta love air conditioning at these high levels of humidity.” If you tap
    the option to remove ads, a pop-up asks you to pay $4 for 1Weather Pro.

- en: What feels particularly ghoulish is that all of these services are absolutely
    hungry for your data — they want to be able to send you notifications, track your
    whereabouts, and download apps on your behalf — and it’s hard to tell exactly
    what company is behind any of it. The “About” section in the weather app says
    it comes from [a service called OneLouder](https://pinsightmedia.com/solutions/onelouder).
    OneLouder, it turns out, is [owned by Pinsight media](https://pinsightmedia.com/),
    which was formerly owned by Sprint and now owned by [a company called InMobi](https://www.inmobi.com/).
    To be clear, this app asks for *constant access to your location.* At the very
    least, it should be clear exactly what company you’re giving that permission to!

    happen to purchase this phone. You can download another weather app from a source
    your trust, or at least one that you can identify. You can make your own damn
    app folders. But if you’re not technically savvy, you probably won’t realize you
    can do all of this. That’s a shame, because there’s a good budget phone underneath
    all of this crap.
