- en: A West Texas company says it's found a remarkably simple way to slash air cargo
    costs as much as 65% – by having planes tow autonomous, cargo-carrying gliders
    behind them, big enough to double, or potentially triple their payload capacity.

- en: The idea certainly isn't a new one – payload-carrying gliders were towed toward
    combat zones in World War 2, full of troops and/or equipment, then released to
    attempt unpowered landings in the thick of things – with widely variable results,
    particularly where stone-walled farms were a factor.

    III some 3-6,000 ft (900-1800m) back from another](https://www.upi.com/Business_News/Security-Industry/2013/08/19/USAF-touts-flying-technique-for-fuel-savings/UPI-49021376934304/),
    "surfing" the vortices left in the lead plane's wake – much like ducks flying
    in formation – and found there were double-digit fuel savings to be gained.

- en: But Texas startup Aerolane says the savings will be much more substantial with
    purpose-built autonomous cargo gliders connected to the lead plane with a simple
    tow rope. With no propulsion systems, you save all the weight of engines, motors,
    fuel or batteries. There'll be no cabin for a pilot, just space for cargo and
    the autonomous flight control systems that'll run them.

    a recreational glider. They'll lift off more or less together with the lead plane,
    then stay on the rope throughout the cruise phase of flight, autonomously surfing
    the lead plane's wake for minimal drag and optimal lift. And they'll either land
    right behind the lead plane, rope still attached, or eventually possibly be released
    at an ideal spot so they can make their own descent, potentially landing at an
    entirely different airstrip than the lead plane.

    Aerolane believes it shouldn't be treated much differently by the FAA than regular
    ol' recreational gliders. It remains to be seen how the FAA will feel about this.

    at this point, but have a custom autopilot system designed to surf the lead plane's
    wake vortex for maximum efficiency

    as shown in the video above, and has been doing so since 2022\. The first is a
    converted 1,000 lb Pipistrel Virus, the second is a rather spunky-looking Velocity
    SE canard pusher, that's also been converted for the job. Both run Aerolane's
    own autopilot system, designed specifically for efficient vortex surfing.

- en: Both still have engines in them, but Aerolane is working with the FAA to get
    authorization to start building aircraft without powertrains, using lightweight
    materials. At that point, it'll look to build a 3-ton cargo glider, then a 10-ton
    version.

    and has set a target date of 2025 for "initial availability." It doesn't have
    any early customers signed up yet, but once it gets custom prototypes benchmarked,
    the idea of "the speed of air at the cost of ground" could well get freight operations
    interested, even if these tow-gliders are sure to drop jaws everywhere one takes
    off or lands.
