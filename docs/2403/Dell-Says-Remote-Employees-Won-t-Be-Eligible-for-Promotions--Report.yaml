    long been an advocate of remote work and not so long ago called it [“the future
    of work.”](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/culture-key-hybrid-work-michael-dell/)
    But it seems that even Dell (the company), can’t help but follow the trend among
    technology companies suddenly convinced that in-office work is the best work.

- en: Most recently, that mindset has led to changes in the company’s promotion policy,
    according to a report from [Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/dell-remote-workers-promotion-return-office-push-flexible-work-2024-3).
    The outlet found that Dell is telling remote employees they will no longer be
    considered for promotions. In order to qualify for promotions, employees must
    go in to work at their nearest “approved office” at least three days a week, according
    to documents seen by Business Insider.

    of tech companies that embraced remote work during the covid-19 pandemic, only
    to pull back and demand previously remote employees return to the office. Last
    August, Amazon CEO [Andy Jassy reportedly told employees](https://gizmodo.com/amazon-ceo-tells-workers-to-return-to-office-or-fired-1850783235)
    that if they didn’t want to go back to the office, “It’s not going to work out
    for you” at the company. Even Zoom, the company that became a household name due
    to remote work, [called its employees back in](https://gizmodo.com/zoom-ceo-return-to-office-leaked-audio-1850769660).

    years, requiring employees living within an hour of one of its offices to [go
    in at least three days a week](https://www.theregister.com/2023/05/10/dell_remote_work_revision/)
    in 2023, none of the changes appeared designed to be punitive until now. The new
    promotion policy for remote workers stands out among tech companies—and goes against
    what Dell itself has said in the past.
