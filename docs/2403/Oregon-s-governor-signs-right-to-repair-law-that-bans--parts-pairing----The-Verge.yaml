- en: Oregon Governor Tina Kotek has now signed one of the strongest US right-to-repair
    bills into law after it [passed the state legislature several weeks ago](/2024/3/4/24090828/oregon-right-to-repair-sb-1596-parts-pairing)
    by an almost 3-to-1 margin. [Oregon’s SB 1596](https://olis.oregonlegislature.gov/liz/2024R1/Measures/Overview/SB1596)
    will take effect next year, and, like similar laws introduced in [Minnesota](/2023/5/24/23736326/minnesota-right-to-repair-laws-passed-electronics-free-documentation)
    and [California](/23910066/right-to-repair-law-newsom-california-sb-244), it requires
    device manufacturers to allow consumers and independent electronics businesses
    to purchase the necessary parts and equipment required to make their own device
    repairs.

    — a practice manufacturers use to prevent replacement components from working
    unless the company’s software approves them. These protections also prevent manufacturers
    from using parts pairing to reduce device functionality or performance or display
    any misleading warning messages about unofficial components installed within a
    device. Current devices are excluded from the ban, which only applies to gadgets
    manufactured after January 1st, 2025.

    — and that starts by empowering repair,” Nathan Proctor, the Public Interest Research
    Group’s (PIRG) right to repair campaign senior director, [says in a statement](https://pirg.org/media-center/oregon-gov-signs-right-to-repair/#:~:text=Nathan%20Proctor&text=SALEM%2C%20Ore.,appliances%2C%20laptops%20and%20cell%20phones.).
    “Oregon’s nation-leading Right to Repair law will keep devices working and off
    the scrap heap.”

- en: Much like Minnesota’s and California’s laws, Oregon’s other right-to-repair
    rules only apply to phones sold after July 1st, 2021, or to other consumer electronics
    equipment sold after July 1st, 2015\. Some products — like devices powered by
    combustion engines, medical equipment, farming equipment, HVAC equipment, video
    game consoles, and energy storage systems — are excluded from Oregon’s rules entirely.

    “The exemption list is a map of the strongest anti-repair lobbies, and also of
    the next frontier of the movement.” However, iFixit CEO Kyle Wiens also said in
    the statement, “By applying to most products made after 2015, this law will open
    up repair for the things Oregonians need to get fixed right now. And by limiting
    the repair-restricting practices of parts pairing, it protects fixing for years
    to come. We won’t stop fighting until everyone, everywhere has these rights.”'

- en: Another similarity between Oregon’s and California’s right-to-repair laws is
    that both push manufacturers to make any documentation, tools, parts, and software
    required to fix their devices available to consumers and repair shops without
    overcharging for them. But while California’s law requires this support to be
    available for seven years after production for devices over $100, Oregon hasn’t
    mandated any such duration.
