    handler.

- en: Zlobina was waiting for her beau aboard a dingy Greek-flagged cutter, “Poseidon
    III,” in the Mediterranean waters off the coast of Nice. Marsalek arrived with
    a second man, who was carrying his suitcase. Marsalek climbed down a ladder into
    the vessel and gave Zlobina a perfunctory peck on the cheek. He was clearly angry,
    which was the point of this vignette, captured on marina security camera footage
    retrieved by *Der Spiegel*. The Poseidon III was a ruse, Natasha’s joke.

- en: Zlobina’s birthday gift to Marsalek — or maybe to herself — was an introduction
    aboard the yacht to a man named Stanislav Petlinsky. Zlobina introduced Marsalek
    to Petlinsky as “Stas, the General from GRU.” At the time, Petlinsky was dating
    Zlobina’s best friend, and she promised Marsalek that “Stas” would be a terrific
    addition to his thickening rolodex of influential Russian contacts.

- en: In the 90s, Petlinsky had been a supervising officer in the GRU Spetsnaz, or
    special forces, and fought in Chechnya. He spent that floating evening with Marsalek
    regaling him with his exploits — particularly as a marksman, as Marsalek expressed
    an interest in guns. Petlinsky’s exact rank and role in Russian intelligence —
    hinted at by the man himself to an intimate circle of contacts, either in truth
    or as provocatively sprinkled bits of disinformation aimed at burnishing his legend
    — is murky, but Western spy agencies do not doubt that his employer is the Russian
    state.

    occurred mere weeks ago at the Jumeirah al-Naseem beach resort in Dubai — amid
    a plentiful selection of champagne, Beluga caviar, and young Russian women.

    far from him is another Russian, Alexander Lebedev, the ex-KGB officer turned
    oligarch and publishing magnate who controls Britain’s *Independent* and *Evening
    Standard* newspapers. The two clearly know each other and nod a silent greeting.

- en: Trim at 60, dressed in a gray pinstripe, black tee, and mirrored aviator sunglasses,
    Petlinsky confirms meeting Marsalek aboard the yacht in Nice in July 2014\. “You
    know, I fell in love with him from the first moment,” he said. “He has such a
    beautiful mind. I always think so small, in dimensions of what’s possible,” Petlinsky
    continues, echoing Marsalek’s animadversions about his own father. “Jan always
    thinks big, very, very big.” Being chancellor of Germany? Too small for Marsalek.
    “But uniting China, Russia, and Europe as a counterbalance to the USA? That would
    interest him.”

- en: Fancy toys and women aren’t Marsalek’s motivation, Petlinsky insists before
    describing the Austrian’s “beautiful mind” as being “a bit autistic.” While Marsalek’s
    acquaintances almost universally define him with the word “charisma,” Petlinsky
    says Marsalek’s weak point is dealing with people. “He lacks empathy,” the Russian
    spy says, not noting that the trait he describes is a telltale sign of the sociopath.

- en: What about Marsalek’s espionage and Petlinsky’s role in it? The Austrian is
    just playacting at spy games, Petlinsky maintains, inhabiting a theatrical role
    with no real-world legitimacy to it. Marsalek is “obsessed” with spycraft and
    all its mystique, something others also attest to. As for Petlinsky himself, he
    swears he’s merely a “security advisor” with a big portfolio in Africa, the kind
    of man who sometimes meets with Putin and chases down FSB agents. He offers a
    robust critique of the amateurish nature of the Khangoshvili assassination in
    Berlin — no small thing given that Putin has recently praised the killer Krasikov
    as a “patriot” in a much-discussed sit-down interview with Tucker Carlson. Petlinsky
    admits to introducing Marsalek to a host of colorful characters in Russia. He
    doesn’t want to talk about which ones were Russian intelligence officers, and
    he changes the subject.

    divided in two halves: “before Stas” and “after Stas.”'

    was to Tunisia via private jet from Moscow in March 2016\. The next month, they
    returned to Nice, the scene of Marsalek and Petlinsky’s meet-cute recruitment;
    then it was on to Tel Aviv. Stas pulled plenty of strings, as Russian border records
    demonstrate that much of his foreign travel is designated as “official visit to
    a diplomatic mission,” a category typically reserved for Russian Foreign Ministry
    officials.

- en: The relationship was so close that, at one point, Petlinsky even told friends
    that he relocated his own mother, who suffered from health problems, to a clinic
    in Munich just to be closer to Marsalek, who built himself his own back office
    for Wirecard and other pursuits in a villa at Prinzregentenstraße 61, right in
    the center of the Bavarian capital. Johanna Singer, an employee of Wirecard (name
    has been changed on her request), recalled meeting Petlinsky at the gourmet Munich
    restaurant Tantris, where the GRU officer celebrated one of his birthdays with
    Marsalek, complete with a cake shaped in uncanny resemblance to the Soviet red
    star. One of the toniest areas of Munich, the high-ceilinged, white-columned digs
    cost €680,000 per year in rent, all paid for, of course, by Wirecard via its manifold
    holdings. A germaphobe in the mold of Donald Trump (the Wirecard executive somehow
    unsurprisingly owns a life-sized cut-out of the 45th U.S. President), Marsalek
    even had a field hospital built in the villa during the pandemic. The back office
    was conveniently situated directly across from the Russian consulate in Bavaria.

- en: A proud owner of a Harley Davidson himself, he introduced Marsalek to a heavy-set
    man fond of Hells Angels attire, whom Petlinsky referred to as “Vladimir, my mercenary.”
    Vladimir’s actual name is Anatoliy Karaziy. Like Petlinsky, Karaziy is a former
    GRU Spetsnaz officer, and the two are thought to have served together in Chechnya.
    At the very least, the mercenary part of the story proved true, as Karaziy belonged
    to a guns-for-hire outfit that gained in infamy after its debut on the battlefields
    of eastern Ukraine in 2014\. It was called the Wagner Group, and it was founded
    by catering magnate and ex-con Yevgeny Prigozhin, a personal friend of Putin’s
    from their native St. Petersburg.
