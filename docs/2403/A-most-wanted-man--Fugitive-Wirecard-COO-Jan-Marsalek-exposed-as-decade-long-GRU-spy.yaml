    handler.

    III,” in the Mediterranean waters off the coast of Nice. Marsalek arrived with
    a second man, who was carrying his suitcase. Marsalek climbed down a ladder into
    the vessel and gave Zlobina a perfunctory peck on the cheek. He was clearly angry,
    which was the point of this vignette, captured on marina security camera footage
    retrieved by *Der Spiegel*. The Poseidon III was a ruse, Natasha’s joke.

- en: Zlobina’s birthday gift to Marsalek — or maybe to herself — was an introduction
    aboard the yacht to a man named Stanislav Petlinsky. Zlobina introduced Marsalek
    to Petlinsky as “Stas, the General from GRU.” At the time, Petlinsky was dating
    Zlobina’s best friend, and she promised Marsalek that “Stas” would be a terrific
    addition to his thickening rolodex of influential Russian contacts.

- en: In the 90s, Petlinsky had been a supervising officer in the GRU Spetsnaz, or
    special forces, and fought in Chechnya. He spent that floating evening with Marsalek
    regaling him with his exploits — particularly as a marksman, as Marsalek expressed
    an interest in guns. Petlinsky’s exact rank and role in Russian intelligence —
    hinted at by the man himself to an intimate circle of contacts, either in truth
    or as provocatively sprinkled bits of disinformation aimed at burnishing his legend
    — is murky, but Western spy agencies do not doubt that his employer is the Russian
    state.

    Standard* newspapers. The two clearly know each other and nod a silent greeting.

- en: Trim at 60, dressed in a gray pinstripe, black tee, and mirrored aviator sunglasses,
    Petlinsky confirms meeting Marsalek aboard the yacht in Nice in July 2014\. “You
    know, I fell in love with him from the first moment,” he said. “He has such a
    beautiful mind. I always think so small, in dimensions of what’s possible,” Petlinsky
    continues, echoing Marsalek’s animadversions about his own father. “Jan always
    thinks big, very, very big.” Being chancellor of Germany? Too small for Marsalek.
    “But uniting China, Russia, and Europe as a counterbalance to the USA? That would
    interest him.”

    describing the Austrian’s “beautiful mind” as being “a bit autistic.” While Marsalek’s
    acquaintances almost universally define him with the word “charisma,” Petlinsky
    says Marsalek’s weak point is dealing with people. “He lacks empathy,” the Russian
    spy says, not noting that the trait he describes is a telltale sign of the sociopath.

  zh: 皮特林斯基坚称，花哨的玩具和女人并不是马萨莱克的动机，然后形容这位奥地利人的“美丽心灵”有些“自闭症”。虽然几乎所有认识马萨莱克的人都用“魅力”这个词来形容他，但皮特林斯基说，马萨莱克的软肋是处理人际关系。“他缺乏同理心，”这位俄罗斯间谍说，没有提到他描述的特质是反社会人格的一个显著特征。
- en: What about Marsalek’s espionage and Petlinsky’s role in it? The Austrian is
    just playacting at spy games, Petlinsky maintains, inhabiting a theatrical role
    with no real-world legitimacy to it. Marsalek is “obsessed” with spycraft and
    all its mystique, something others also attest to. As for Petlinsky himself, he
    swears he’s merely a “security advisor” with a big portfolio in Africa, the kind
    of man who sometimes meets with Putin and chases down FSB agents. He offers a
    robust critique of the amateurish nature of the Khangoshvili assassination in
    Berlin — no small thing given that Putin has recently praised the killer Krasikov
    as a “patriot” in a much-discussed sit-down interview with Tucker Carlson. Petlinsky
    admits to introducing Marsalek to a host of colorful characters in Russia. He
    doesn’t want to talk about which ones were Russian intelligence officers, and
    he changes the subject.

  zh: 马萨莱克的间谍活动和皮特林斯基在其中的角色呢？皮特林斯基坚持认为，这位奥地利人只是在玩间谍游戏，扮演了一个在现实世界中没有合法性的戏剧性角色。马萨莱克“迷恋”间谍活动及其神秘性，其他人也证实了这一点。至于皮特林斯基本人，他发誓自己只是一个在非洲拥有大量业务的“安全顾问”，有时会与普京会面，并追逐俄罗斯联邦安全局特工。他对柏林的哈诺戈斯维利暗杀的业余性质提出了强烈的批评
    —— 这并不是小事，考虑到普京最近在与塔克·卡尔森的广受关注的面对面访谈中称赞刺客克拉西科夫是“爱国者”。皮特林斯基承认，他介绍马萨莱克认识了一群俄罗斯的丰富多彩的人物。他不想谈论其中哪些是俄罗斯情报官员，并转移了话题。

  zh: 但是据《明镜》杂志了解到，他的一些亲密朋友吹嘘说，在2014年南法的第一次会面后，皮特林斯基就把马萨莱克交给了俄罗斯军事情报局。马萨莱克的朋友们说，Wirecard的欺诈者的生活可以分为两个阶段：“斯塔斯之前”和“斯塔斯之后”。
- en: They traveled together, often as a trio, with Zlobina in tow. One such trip
    was to Tunisia via private jet from Moscow in March 2016\. The next month, they
    returned to Nice, the scene of Marsalek and Petlinsky’s meet-cute recruitment;
    then it was on to Tel Aviv. Stas pulled plenty of strings, as Russian border records
    demonstrate that much of his foreign travel is designated as “official visit to
    a diplomatic mission,” a category typically reserved for Russian Foreign Ministry
    officials.

  zh: 他们经常一起旅行，通常是三人组合，带着兹洛比纳。其中一次旅行是2016年3月，他们乘坐私人飞机从莫斯科飞往突尼斯。下个月，他们返回尼斯，那是马萨莱克和彼得林斯基的初次见面的地方；然后他们前往特拉维夫。根据俄罗斯边境记录，斯塔斯通过了很多关卡，外国旅行大多标记为“外交任务”，这通常是俄罗斯外交部官员的身份。
- en: The relationship was so close that, at one point, Petlinsky even told friends
    that he relocated his own mother, who suffered from health problems, to a clinic
    in Munich just to be closer to Marsalek, who built himself his own back office
    for Wirecard and other pursuits in a villa at Prinzregentenstraße 61, right in
    the center of the Bavarian capital. Johanna Singer, an employee of Wirecard (name
    has been changed on her request), recalled meeting Petlinsky at the gourmet Munich
    restaurant Tantris, where the GRU officer celebrated one of his birthdays with
    Marsalek, complete with a cake shaped in uncanny resemblance to the Soviet red
    star. One of the toniest areas of Munich, the high-ceilinged, white-columned digs
    cost €680,000 per year in rent, all paid for, of course, by Wirecard via its manifold
    holdings. A germaphobe in the mold of Donald Trump (the Wirecard executive somehow
    unsurprisingly owns a life-sized cut-out of the 45th U.S. President), Marsalek
    even had a field hospital built in the villa during the pandemic. The back office
    was conveniently situated directly across from the Russian consulate in Bavaria.

  zh: 这段关系如此密切，以至于彼得林斯基曾告诉朋友，他把自己患有健康问题的母亲搬到了慕尼黑的一家诊所，只是为了更接近马萨莱克。后者在慕尼黑巴伐利亚首府中心的普林策根滕街61号的别墅里为自己建立了一个后勤办公室，专供Wirecard和其他事业使用。约翰娜·辛格，Wirecard的一名员工（她的名字因请求已更改），回忆起在慕尼黑美食餐厅Tantris见到彼得林斯基，这位格鲁军官与马萨莱克庆祝他的生日，还有一个蛋糕，形状与苏联红星惊人地相似。作为慕尼黑最豪华的地区之一，这座高天花板、白柱的住所每年租金高达68万欧元，当然全部由Wirecard通过其多样化持有支付。马萨莱克像唐纳德·特朗普那样有洁癖（不出所料，这位Wirecard高管甚至拥有一张45届美国总统的真人大小剪影），甚至在疫情期间在别墅内建立了一个野战医院。后勤办公室恰好位于巴伐利亚的俄罗斯领事馆对面。

- en: A proud owner of a Harley Davidson himself, he introduced Marsalek to a heavy-set
    man fond of Hells Angels attire, whom Petlinsky referred to as “Vladimir, my mercenary.”
    Vladimir’s actual name is Anatoliy Karaziy. Like Petlinsky, Karaziy is a former
    GRU Spetsnaz officer, and the two are thought to have served together in Chechnya.
    At the very least, the mercenary part of the story proved true, as Karaziy belonged
    to a guns-for-hire outfit that gained in infamy after its debut on the battlefields
    of eastern Ukraine in 2014\. It was called the Wagner Group, and it was founded
    by catering magnate and ex-con Yevgeny Prigozhin, a personal friend of Putin’s
    from their native St. Petersburg.

  zh: 作为一名哈雷戴维森摩托车的自豪所有者，他向马萨莱克介绍了一个喜欢地狱天使服装的大块头男人，彼得林斯基称他为“弗拉基米尔，我的雇佣兵”。弗拉基米尔的真实姓名是安纳托利·卡拉兹依。像彼得林斯基一样，卡拉兹依是一名前俄罗斯特种部队格鲁乌的军官，据信两人曾在车臣一起服役。至少，故事中的雇佣兵部分是真实的，因为卡拉兹依是一名雇佣兵，他所属的武装集团自2014年在乌克兰东部战场上首次亮相后声名鹊起。该组织被称为“瓦格纳集团”，由餐饮业大亨和前囚犯叶甫根尼·普里戈津创立，后者是普京的个人朋友，来自他们共同的圣彼得堡。
