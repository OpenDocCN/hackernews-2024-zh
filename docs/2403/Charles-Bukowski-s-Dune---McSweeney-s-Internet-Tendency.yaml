- en: It had been a long day. The hot-shit new supervisor, who looked about sixteen
    and probably hadn’t even started shaving yet, had written me up twice. I’d crumpled
    both slips in front of him, thrown them in the trash.

    had to hop off into the sand. The thing was already starting to stink as I began
    the trudge uphill, bone-tired and thirsty.

    Her eyes were permanently blue and her front teeth were chipped from fighting,
    but otherwise she wasn’t much worse for wear.

    a start,” she said. She smiled and looked at me like she wanted to get her hooks
    in me, ride me awhile.

    knives drawn. I took her arm and we stumbled out into the night, leaning on each
    other as we made our way through still-warm sand, our doubled moonshadows staggering
    along beside us.

    typewriter and didn’t look up. When you’re on a spice bender, you hold on or it
    throws you off and circles back to finish you off.

    and filth of the world, filtering it enough to make it palatable.* The tapping
    echoed off the stone walls.

    was a package that needed a signature, which always brought out the lunatics.
    Before I could knock a woman flung open the door, eyes wide and blue, hair sticking
    out in all directions.

    palm wine day and night. But back home I was unknown. People didn’t understand.
    “If things are so good there, why come back?” they’d say.

    here, even if it meant I was hungry, spice-drunk, tapping away in my hollowed-out
    rock in Los Gusanos with my hot plate and half-fridge and dirty mattress. At least
    the days were shorter.

    the worm to work, and deliver the mails. It was enough to pay the rent and keep

    fumbling with my keys. The new guard was perched overhead. I could feel his eyes
    on me in the darkness.

    footsteps on stone as he hopped down the boulders toward me. I got the key into
    the lock and shut the door behind me, and soon I was on my mattress, eating spice
    and sardines on crackers and drinking a bottle of palm wine I’d found in the fridge.

    reason, it just seemed like a thing to do. I put on my cleanest stillsuit, which
    still smelled like sweat and spilled wine.

    sun, still drunk enough to avoid the hangover I knew was coming. The guard wasn’t
    there, but I heard his voice in my head, *Do the shuffle, keep those feet moving,
    you old fuck.* I pulled half a leftover spice bar from my pocket and took a bite.

    smaller and smaller, walking on the surface of an ocean, whale-worms passing through
    the depths below me. *Kwisatz whateverthefuck*, I thought, stomping on the sandy
    ground. Then I leaned back and yelled, “COME AND GET IT, YOU UGLY BASTARDS.”
