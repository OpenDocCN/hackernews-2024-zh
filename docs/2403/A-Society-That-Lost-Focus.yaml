  zh: 简单来说，做个数学题吧。如果你在Facebook上有180个朋友，这在今天看来可能是一个较低的数字，如果你的朋友们平均每年休假10天，那么你平均每天会有五个朋友在度假。还要考虑到一些人喜欢重新发布以前度假的照片，这意味着在你在灰暗的办公室等待下一个无聊会议时，你每天都会被晒到阳光明媚的沙滩和美丽景色的图片轰炸。Facebook的设计让你感到痛苦。
- en: That’s not to say that Facebook cannot be useful and have benefits. As Cal Newport
    highlight, you need to adapt your use to maximise the benefits while trying to
    avoid costs as much as possible. You have to think consciously about what you
    really want to achieve.

  zh: 这并不意味着Facebook没有用处或好处。正如卡尔·纽波特所强调的，你需要根据最大化利益来调整你的使用方式，同时尽量避免成本。你必须有意识地思考你真正想要达成什么目标。
- en: This idea of digital minimalism prompted a revival of the so-called "dumb phones",
    phones which are not smart and which are able to make phone call and send/receive
    SMS. Some brands are even starting to innovate in that particular market like
    Mudita and Lightphone.

- en: One of the consumerist credo is that the market will fix everything. If there’s
    a problem, someone will quickly sell a solution. As pointed by Evgeny Morozov
    in "To Save Everything, Click Here", this is not only wrong thinking. This is
    actually harmful.

  zh: 消费主义信条之一是市场将会解决一切问题。如果出现问题，总会有人迅速推出解决方案。正如 Evgeny Morozov 在《要救一切，点击这里》中指出的，这种想法不仅是错误的，实际上是有害的。
- en: 'With public money, we are actually actively funding companies and startups
    thinking they will both create jobs and sell solutions to every problem. It is
    implied that every solution should be a technological one, should be sellable
    and should be intuitive. That’s it: you should not think too much about a problem
    but instead build blindly whatever solution comes to mind using the currently
    trending technological stack. French Author Antoine Gouritin wrote a funny and
    interesting book about that whole philosophy he called "Le Startupisme".'

  zh: 用公共资金，我们实际上正在积极资助公司和初创公司，认为它们将创造就业机会并为每一个问题提供解决方案。隐含的是，每一个解决方案都应该是技术的，可销售的，并且应该直观。就是这样：你不应该过多地思考一个问题，而是盲目地使用当前流行的技术堆栈构建任何解决方案。法国作家安托万·古里丹写了一本有趣而有趣的书，称之为《创业主义》。
- en: 'The root cause is there: we don’t have any mental framework left other than
    spying on people and steal their attention. Business schools are teaching how
    to do catchy PowerPoints while stealing attention from people. Every business
    is at war with the other to catch your attention and your brain cycles. Even academy
    is now fighting to get grants based on catchy PowerPoints and raw number of publications.
    This was the raw observation of David Graeber: even academics have stopped thinking
    to play the "catch your attention game".'

  zh: 根本原因就在于此：我们除了监视他人并窃取他们的注意力外，已经没有其他心理框架了。商学院正在教授如何制作吸引人的幻灯片，同时从人们那里窃取注意力。每一个企业都在争夺你的注意力和你的脑力。即使学术界现在也在争夺基于引人注目的幻灯片和出版物原始数量的拨款。这是
    David Graeber 的最初观察：即使学者们也停止了思考，而是在玩“抓住你的注意力”的游戏。
- en: There’s no silver bullet. There will not be any technological solution. If we
    want to claim back our focus and our brain cycles, we will need to walkaway and
    normalise disconnected times. To recognise and share the work of those who are
    not seeking attention at all cost, who don’t have catchy slogans nor spectacular
    conclusions. We need to start to appreciate harder works which don’t offer us
    immediate short-term profit.

  zh: 没有银弹。技术解决方案也不会有。如果我们想要重新夺回我们的注意力和脑力，我们需要离开并规范化断开的时光。我们需要认识和分享那些并非不惜一切寻求关注，没有吸引人口号或壮观结论的人们的工作。我们需要开始赞赏那些不提供即时短期利润的更加辛苦的工作。
