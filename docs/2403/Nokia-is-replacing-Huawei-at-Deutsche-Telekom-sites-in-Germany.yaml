- en: A red card in Germany was a massive European setback for Nokia in 2018, when
    Deutsche Telekom shifted to Ericsson, its Swedish rival, in apparent dissatisfaction
    with the Finnish vendor. Nokia had supplied the radio access network (RAN) products
    for about a third of the German incumbent's network. After being replaced by its
    Swedish competitor, and a subsequent overhaul of its 5G product portfolio, it
    now has an eye on the other two-thirds.

- en: That has long been the territory of Huawei, a controversial Chinese vendor deemed
    a security threat by some western officials. Worried about a lack of alternatives,
    and the difficulty of swapping out equipment and combining vendors, Deutsche Telekom
    began to experiment with open RAN (O-RAN), a supposed interoperability aid and
    boost for specialists. At Neubrandenburg, rechristened "O-RAN Town" by the telco,
    it has tried out products supplied by numerous alternatives to Ericsson and Huawei.
    In December, it [unveiled plans](https://www.lightreading.com/open-ran/eurobites-deutsche-telekom-nokia-get-serious-in-o-ran-town-)
    to bring open RAN to 3,000 sites, about 12% of the 5G total.

    of their installed base with Huawei," said Tommi Uitto, the head of Nokia''s mobile
    business group. "It is 3,000 sites of replacement, plus then there would be new
    sites, in one part of the network in Germany."'

    footprint for Nokia. And Uitto, who has led the company's mobile turnaround since
    taking charge in late 2018, clearly hopes there could be a much bigger role for
    it in future. "Why give somebody just 3,000?" he said. The implication is that
    Deutsche Telekom plans a more comprehensive overhaul depending on how circumstances
    evolve.

    of his Chinese competitors. "We have to win more from those who don't embrace
    open RAN than we lose, because many of these operators have to reduce their exposure
    to so-called high-risk vendors." Despite the recent loss of AT&T business to Ericsson,
    Nokia claims to have increased its share of the 5G market outside China from 23%
    to 29% in the last two years. And its overall RAN share excluding China is up
    from about 23% to 27% over roughly the same period, according to Uitto.

    group behind open RAN specifications. Its top executives continue to reject open
    and virtual RAN architecture as suboptimal. "We think there are still some problems
    – the first one is power efficiency, and the other one is performance," said Philip
    Song, the chief marketing officer of Huawei's carrier business group, during a
    press conference at Mobile World Congress (MWC) this week.

    and joining together can provide good network performance," he said. When it comes
    to the power amplifiers used in radios, Huawei remains "one generation ahead of
    competitors," he said.'

    prompted an operator in one European market to explore alternatives, said a top
    executive at the telco, requesting anonymity. And a formal ban on the use of Huawei
    kit remains a distinct possibility in Europe's biggest economy.

    that proposed giving Deutsche Telekom, Telefónica and Vodafone until October 2026
    to ensure that no more than 25% of the RAN is managed by either Huawei or ZTE,
    a smaller Chinese vendor. The uncertainty is whether this 25% rule means stripping
    out components or merely changing management software. Yet managing Chinese hardware
    with another company's software looks problematic.

    radios is a critical aspect of the new arrangement with Deutsche Telekom. Using
    a standardized interface, the Finnish vendor is pairing its baseband software,
    hosted in central and distributed units, with radios built by Japan's Fujitsu.

    board member for technology and innovation, during a presentation at MWC this
    week. "We are addressing a challenged ecosystem and we doubled down on O-RAN,"
    she said. "As I speak, we have real customers live in a multivendor O-RAN environment."

    provide the radio units as well as the baseband products. Unlike Ericsson, it
    also plans to develop products compatible with the various flavors of open RAN
    technology, Uitto confirmed. That will mean producing radio units both with and
    without the equalizer, an interference-addressing network function.

    must include equalizers to ensure they work with both types of radio unit. Ericsson
    has said it will not develop radios without equalizers while insisting that its
    baseband products will support them. But without directly naming Ericsson, Uitto
    sounds skeptical.

    support the equalizer, they cannot connect the baseband that doesn''t have the
    equalizer to the radio unit that doesn''t have the equalizer because there is
    an equalizer nowhere," he said. "And that is why a big competitor has a problem
    with the installed base. You have to change to a new baseband or do cloud RAN.
    You can''t use the existing baseband."'
