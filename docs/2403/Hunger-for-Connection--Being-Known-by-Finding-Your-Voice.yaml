- en: A nineteen-year-old Richard Wright thumbed a copy of the Memphis *Commercial
    Appeal*, landing on an editorial denouncing the famous—or infamous—newspaperman
    and critic H.L. Mencken as a fool.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '“I felt a vague sympathy for him,” said Wright. The only people denounced in
    southern newspapers, as far as Wright knew, were people who looked like him: black.
    But Wright knew Mencken wasn’t black. He earned the editor’s vitriol from his
    ideas alone, and Wright instantly knew he wanted to read those for himself.'

    at the local library. No worries; he had a plan.'

- en: Wright approached a coworker. Being Irish Catholic, the man was socially marginalized
    like Wright. But he was white—and that meant he could get a library card. In fact,
    Wright had picked up books for the man before. He could do so again, but this
    time he’d just keep the books to read for himself. His friend agreed.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Armed with a borrowed library card and a forged request, Wright secured a copy
    of Mencken’s *A Book of Prefaces* and also his *Prejudices*. “I was jarred and
    shocked by the style, the clear, clean, sweeping sentences,” he said.

    using them as one would use a club. . . . Occasionally I glanced up to reassure
    myself that I was alone in the room.

- en: Wright was smart to be worried. Entertaining such thoughts in the presence of
    southern whites was likely to end in violence. Social structures and strictures
    had evolved to keep blacks in check, and those who didn’t play along found themselves
    subject to shocking brutality. In Mencken’s rowdy, irreverent prose, Wright found
    a space where he could push back, even if only in his mind.

- en: Born in 1908 to poor parents with a doomed marriage that ended when he was young,
    Wright’s upbringing was marked by deprivation. He had little to eat and schooling
    was catch-as-catch-can. He was almost a teenager before he ever had a regular
    year of class.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: He learned to read, regardless. Neighborhood kids would play in the streets
    after class, leaving their books on the curb. “I would thumb through the pages
    and question them about the baffling black print,” he said. “When I had learned
    to recognize certain words, I told my mother that I wanted to learn to read and
    she encouraged me.” The two would sit and read the Sunday paper together, Mom
    nudging and guiding him down the columns of text. “Soon I was able to pick my
    way through most of the children’s books I ran across,” he said.

    situation unsustainable. Mom, son, and younger brother moved in with the family
    matriarch, a harsh Seventh Day Adventist born in the days of slavery, whose economic
    condition was only marginally better than their own and who possessed no appreciation
    for Wright’s budding love of literature. On the contrary, Grandma was vitriolic
    in her opposition.

- en: There in her Jackson, Mississippi, home Wright’s grandmother boarded a school
    teacher. One day while sitting on the front porch, the teacher read him *Bluebeard
    and His Seven Wives* at Wright’s prompting. Before she could finish, the old scold
    interrupted. “You stop that!” she yelled. “I want none of that Devil stuff in
    my house!” When Wright protested, she backhanded him.

- en: While physical hunger plays a recurring theme throughout Wright’s two-part narrative,
    his more fundamental hunger was the desire to be seen and known as his genuine
    self. Unfortunately, his family and the wider community denied him that understanding
    throughout his trying childhood and teen years.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: What connection he did experience was often violent. He never could quite accept
    the faith of his family, nor could he avoid getting on the bad sides of his grandmother,
    aunts, and uncles. He struggled to know how to act toward whites, some of whom
    threatened his life. He could read a book, but it took him longer to learn how
    to read people.

    reading the stories in the fiction supplement. Unfortunately, the news section
    printed pieces supporting the KKK. When a neighbor pointed out the problem, Wright
    quit the paper and found other ways to make money.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: He hoped to get a job at local black newspaper, though regular work never came.
    What did come was encouragement. Wright submitted a piece of fiction he’d written,
    and the editor decided to run it.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Maybe he could become a writer? Not if his family had a say. Grandma considered
    fiction mere lies, and no one in his impoverished circle shared any interest in
    supporting his aspiration. Instead, that dream faded until he finally left town
    and found his way to Memphis where, years later, he read those fiery words of
    Mencken.

    also allowed Wright the means of looking out—and eventually walking out.

- en: I had somehow overlooked something terribly important in life. I had once tried
    to write, had once reveled in feeling, had let my crude imagination roam, but
    the impulse to dream had been slowly beaten out of me by experience. Now it surged
    up again and I hungered for books, new ways of looking and seeing. It was not
    a matter of believing or disbelieving what I read, but of feeling something new,
    of being affected by something that made the look of the world different.
  prefs:

- en: Wright began chipping away at the fissure, widening it by his own effort. He
    read novelists Sinclair Lewis, Theodore Dreiser, and others, often reading on
    the sly to avoid the curiosity and suspicion of those around him. As he read,
    his waking reality became less tenable by the day. The racial repression, the
    enforced servility—once exposed to a wider world of seeing and feeling, it all
    felt impossible to bear any longer.

    perhaps, I could use them as a weapon?” he wondered. “No,” he said. “It frightened
    me.” But here we are, reading Wright’s autobiography, written years after and
    amid many other books, including his wildly popular 1940 novel, *Native Son*.
    How exactly Wright found his voice is contained in a second book, *American Hunger*.

    he submitted the manuscript to Harper for publication.

    it to the Book-of-the-Month Club. They showed interest but only in the first part,
    which Wright retitled *Black Boy*—the section that ranged from Wright’s childhood
    to his departure for Chicago. But it was in Chicago that Wright became a writer.

    brother move next. He found work soon enough but also found the adjustment challenging.
    Economically the situation only worsened as the Great Depression arrived two years
    after they did. Thankfully, the literary impulse that inspired his move provided
    him purpose amid the difficulty.

    a national literary society sponsored by the Communist Party. With his talents
    finally nurtured, he developed his skill and showed the kind of promise that drew
    attention from higher-ups in the party. That had drawbacks of its own.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: While Wright remained in ideological sympathy with the party, he found the organization
    and its goals stifling, and the group suffused with paranoia. When he decided
    to write profiles of leading local communists, party members grew suspicious of
    his motives. As he objected, he found himself marginalized.

    over a half a million copies between Harper’s trade edition and the Book-of-the-Month

    half.

    *Black Boy* and seventeen years after Wright’s death in 1960.

    “Sometimes I wonder . . . if other people wonder . . . just like I do!” It closes
    on a note of reserved hope that writing might offer a path to connection:'
