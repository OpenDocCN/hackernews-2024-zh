- en: Today, March 12th, on the [World Day Against Cyber Censorship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Day_Against_Cyber_Censorship),
    the Tor Project's Anti-Censorship Team is excited to officially announce the release
    of WebTunnel, a new type of Tor bridge designed to assist users in heavily censored
    regions to connect to the Tor network. Available now in the stable version of
    Tor Browser, WebTunnel joined our collection of censorship circumvention tech
    developed and maintained by The Tor Project.

- en: The development of different types of bridges are crucial for making Tor more
    resilient against censorship and stay ahead of adversaries in the highly dynamic
    and ever-changing censorship landscape. This is especially true as we're going
    through the 2024 global election megacycle, [the role of censorship circumvention
    tech becomes crucial in defending Internet Freedom](https://blog.torproject.org/2024-defend-internet-freedom-during-elections/).

    to Tor, now is an excellent time to get started! You can find the requirements

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: WebTunnel is a censorship-resistant pluggable transport designed to mimic encrypted
    web traffic (HTTPS) inspired by [HTTPT](https://www.usenix.org/conference/foci20/presentation/frolov).
    It works by wrapping the payload connection into a WebSocket-like HTTPS connection,
    appearing to network observers as an ordinary HTTPS (WebSocket) connection. So,
    for an onlooker without the knowledge of the hidden path, it just looks like a
    regular HTTP connection to a webpage server giving the impression that the user
    is simply browsing the web.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In fact, WebTunnel is so similar to ordinary web traffic that it can coexist
    with a website on the same network endpoint, meaning the same domain, IP address,
    and port. This coexistence allows a standard traffic reverse proxy to forward
    both ordinary web traffic and WebTunnel to their respective application servers.
    As a result, when someone attempts to visit the website at the shared network
    address, they will simply perceive the content of that website address and won't
    notice the existence of a secret bridge (WebTunnel).

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: WebTunnel can be used as an alternative to obfs4 for most Tor Browser users.
    While obfs4 and other fully encrypted traffic aim to be entirely distinct and
    unrecognizable, WebTunnel's approach to mimicking known and typical web traffic
    makes it more effective in scenarios where there is a protocol allow list and
    a deny-by-default network environment.
  prefs: []

- en: Consider a network traffic censorship mechanism as a coin sorting machine, with
    coins representing the flowing traffic. Traditionally, such a machine checks if
    the coin fits a known shape and allows it to pass if it does or discards it if
    it does not. In the case of fully encrypted, unknown traffic, as demonstrated
    in the published research [How the Great Firewall of China Detects and Blocks
    Fully Encrypted Traffic](https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity23/presentation/wu-mingshi),
    which doesn't conform to any specific shape, it would be subject to censorship.
    In our coin analogy, not only must the coin not fit the shape of any known blocked
    protocol, it also needs to fit a recognized allowed shape--otherwise, it would
    be dropped. Obfs4 traffic, being neither a match for any known allowed protocol
    nor a text protocol, would be rejected. In contrast, WebTunnel traffic resembling
    HTTPS traffic, a permitted protocol, will pass.
