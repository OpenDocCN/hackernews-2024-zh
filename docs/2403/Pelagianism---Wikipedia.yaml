    did not taint [human nature](/wiki/Human_nature "Human nature") and that humans

    and philosopher from the British Isles, taught that God could not command believers
    to do the impossible, and therefore it must be possible to satisfy all divine
    commandments. He also taught that it was unjust to punish one person for the sins
    of another; therefore, infants are born blameless. Pelagius accepted no excuse

    ideas became popular among parts of the Roman elite. Historian [Peter Brown](/wiki/Peter_Brown_(historian)
    "Peter Brown (historian)") argued that Pelagianism appealed "to a powerful centrifugal
    tendency in the aristocracy of Rome—a tendency to scatter, to form a pattern of
    little groups, each striving to be an elite, each anxious to rise above their
    neighbours and rivals—the average upper‐class residents of Rome." The powerful

    and connected it with other recognized heresies, including Origenism, [Jovinianism](/wiki/Jovinian

    Scholar Michael Rackett noted that the linkage of Pelagianism and Origenism was
    "dubious" but influential. Jerome also disagreed with Pelagius' strong view of
    [free will](/wiki/Free_will "Free will"). In 415, he wrote *Dialogus adversus
    Pelagianos* to refute Pelagian statements. Noting that Jerome was also an [ascetic](/wiki/Monk
    "Monk") and critical of earthly wealth, historian [Wolf Liebeschuetz](/wiki/Wolf_Liebeschuetz
    "Wolf Liebeschuetz") suggested that his motive for opposing Pelagianism was envy
    of Pelagius' success. In 415, Augustine's emissary [Orosius](/wiki/Orosius "Orosius")
    brought charges against Pelagius at a council in Jerusalem, which were referred
    to Rome for judgement. The same year, the exiled [Gallic](/wiki/Gaul "Gaul") bishops
    [Heros of Arles](/wiki/Heros_of_Arles "Heros of Arles") and [Lazarus of Aix](/wiki/Lazarus_of_Aix
    "Lazarus of Aix") accused Pelagius of heresy, citing passages in Caelestius' *Liber
    de 13 capitula*. Pelagius defended himself by disavowing Caelestius' teachings,
    leading to his acquittal at the [Synod of Diospolis](/wiki/Synod_of_Diospolis
    "Synod of Diospolis") in [Lod](/wiki/Lod "Lod"), which proved to be a key turning
    point in the controversy. Following the verdict, Augustine convinced two [synods](/wiki/Synod
    "Synod") in North Africa to condemn Pelagianism, whose findings were partially
    confirmed by Pope [Innocent I](/wiki/Innocent_I "Innocent I"). In January 417,
    shortly before his death, Innocent [excommunicated](/wiki/Excommunicated "Excommunicated")
    Pelagius and two of his followers. Innocent's successor, [Zosimus](/wiki/Pope_Zosimus
    "Pope Zosimus"), reversed the judgement against Pelagius, but backtracked following
    pressure from the African bishops. Pelagianism was later condemned at the Council
    of Carthage in 418, after which Zosimus issued the *Epistola tractoria* excommunicating
    both Pelagius and Caelestius. Concern that Pelagianism undermined the role of
    the clergy and [episcopacy](/wiki/Episcopacy "Episcopacy") was specifically cited
    in the judgement.

    [Julian of Eclanum](/wiki/Julian_of_Eclanum "Julian of Eclanum"), protested against
    the condemnation of Pelagius and refused to follow Zosimus' *Epistola tractoria*.

    Pelagius as Manichean. Pelagius taught that humans were free of the burden of
    [original sin](/wiki/Original_sin "Original sin"), because it would be unjust
    for any person to be blamed for another's actions. According to Pelagianism, humans
    were created in the [image of God](/wiki/Image_of_God "Image of God") and had
    been granted [conscience](/wiki/Conscience "Conscience") and reason to determine
    right from wrong, and the ability to carry out correct actions. If "sin" could
    not be avoided it could not be considered sin. In Pelagius' view, the doctrine
    of original sin placed too little emphasis on the human capacity for self-improvement,
    leading either to despair or to reliance on forgiveness without responsibility.
    He also argued that many young Christians were comforted with false security about
    their salvation leading them to relax their Christian practice.

    accept the idea that original sin had instilled [fear of death](/wiki/Fear_of_death
    "Fear of death") among humans, as Augustine said. Instead, Pelagius taught that
    the fear of death could be overcome by devout Christians, and that death could
    be a release from toil rather than a punishment. Both Pelagius and Caelestius
    reasoned that it would be unreasonable for God to command the impossible, and
    therefore each human retained [absolute freedom of action](/wiki/Libertarian_free_will

    Pelagius did not accept any limitation on free will, including [necessity](/wiki/Necessity_defense

- en: In the Pelagian view, by corollary, sin was not an inevitable result of fallen
    human nature, but instead came about by [free choice](/wiki/Free_choice "Free
    choice") and bad habits; through repeated sinning, a person could corrupt their
    own nature and enslave themself to sin. Pelagius believed that God had given man
    the [Old Testament](/wiki/Old_Testament "Old Testament") and [Mosaic Law](/wiki/Mosaic_Law
    "Mosaic Law") in order to counter these ingrained bad habits, and when that wore
    off over time God revealed the [New Testament](/wiki/New_Testament "New Testament").
    However, because Pelagius considered a person to always have the ability to choose
    the right action in each circumstance, it was therefore theoretically possible
    (though rare) to live a sinless life. [Jesus Christ](/wiki/Jesus_Christ "Jesus
    Christ"), held in Christian doctrine to have lived a life without sin, was the
    ultimate example for Pelagians seeking perfection in their own lives, but there
    were also other humans who were without sin—including some notable pagans and
    especially the [Hebrew prophets](/wiki/Hebrew_prophets "Hebrew prophets").^([[d]](#cite_note-50))
    This view was at odds with that of Augustine and orthodox Christianity, which
    taught that Jesus was the only man free of sin. Pelagius did teach Jesus' [vicarious
    atonement](/wiki/Vicarious_atonement "Vicarious atonement") for the sins of mankind
    and the cleansing effect of baptism, but placed less emphasis on these aspects.

    well as [divine revelation](/wiki/Divine_revelation "Divine revelation") and the
    example and teachings of Jesus. Further spiritual development, including faith
    in Christianity, was up to individual choice, not divine benevolence. Pelagius
    accepted no excuse for sin, and argued that Christians should be like the church
    described in [Ephesians 5](/wiki/Ephesians_5 "Ephesians 5"):27, "without spot
    or wrinkle".^([[50]](#cite_note-54)) Instead of accepting the inherent imperfection
    of man, or arguing that the highest moral standards could only be applied to an
    elite, Pelagius taught that all Christians should strive for perfection. Like
    [Jovinian](/wiki/Jovinian "Jovinian"), Pelagius taught that married life was not
    inferior to [monasticism](/wiki/Monasticism "Monasticism"), but with the twist
    that all Christians regardless of life situation were called to a kind of asceticism.
    Pelagius taught that it was not sufficient for a person to call themselves a Christian
    and follow the commandments of scripture; it was also essential to actively do
    [good works](/wiki/Good_works "Good works") and cultivate virtue, setting themselves
    apart from the masses who were "Christian in name only", and that Christians ought
    to be extraordinary and irreproachable in conduct. Specifically, he emphasized
    the importance of reading scripture, following religious commandments, charity,
    and taking responsibility for one's actions, and maintaining modesty and moderation.^([[e]](#cite_note-55))
    Pelagius taught that true virtue was not reflected externally in [social status](/wiki/Social_status
    "Social status"), but was an internal spiritual state. He explicitly called on
    wealthy Christians to share their fortunes with the poor. (Augustine criticized
    Pelagius' call for wealth redistribution.)

    Like early Augustine, Pelagians believed that infants would be sent to [purgatory](/wiki/Purgatory
    "Purgatory"). Although Pelagius rejected that [infant baptism](/wiki/Infant_baptism
    "Infant baptism") was necessary to cleanse original sin, he nevertheless supported
    the practice because he felt it improved their spirituality through a closer union
    with Jesus. For adults, baptism was essential because it was the mechanism for
    obtaining forgiveness of the sins that a person had personally committed and a
    new beginning in their relationship with God. After death, adults would be judged
    by their acts and omissions and consigned to [everlasting fire](/wiki/Christian_views_on_Hell
    "Christian views on Hell") if they had failed: "not because of the evils they
    have done, but for their failures to do good". He did not accept purgatory as
    a possible destination for adults. Although Pelagius taught that the path of righteousness
    was open to all, in practice only a few would manage to follow it and be saved.
    Like many medieval theologians, Pelagius believed that instilling in Christians
    the fear of hell was often necessary to convince them to follow their religion

    Pelagius. According to [Thomas Scheck](/wiki/Thomas_Scheck "Thomas Scheck"), Pelagianism
    is the heresy of denying Catholic Church teaching on original sin, or more specifically
    the beliefs condemned as heretical in 417 and 418.^([[g]](#cite_note-68)) In her
    study, Ali Bonner (a lecturer at the [University of Cambridge](/wiki/University_of_Cambridge
    "University of Cambridge")) found that there was no one individual who held all
    the doctrines of "Pelagianism", nor was there a coherent Pelagian movement, although
    these findings are disputed. Bonner argued that the two core ideas promoted by
    Pelagius were "the goodness of human nature and effective free will" although
    both were advocated by other Christian authors from the 360s. Because Pelagius
    did not invent these ideas, she recommended attributing them to the ascetic movement
    rather than using the word "Pelagian". Later Christians used "Pelagianism" as
    an insult for theologically orthodox Christians who held positions that they disagreed
    with. Historian [Eric Nelson](/wiki/Eric_Nelson_(historian) "Eric Nelson (historian)")
    defined genuine Pelagianism as rejection of original sin or denial of original
    sin's effect on man's ability to avoid sin. Even in recent scholarly literature,
    the term "Pelagianism" is not clearly or consistently defined.

    those of Augustine, who declared Pelagius "the enemy of the grace of God".^([[h]](#cite_note-74))
    Augustine distilled what he called Pelagianism into three heretical tenets: "to
    think that God redeems according to some scale of human merit; to imagine that
    some human beings are actually capable of a sinless life; to suppose that the
    descendants of the first human beings to sin are themselves born innocent".^([[i]](#cite_note-76))
    In Augustine''s writings, Pelagius is a symbol of [humanism](/wiki/Humanism "Humanism")
    who excluded God from human salvation. Pelagianism shaped Augustine''s ideas in
    opposition to his own on free will, grace, and original sin, and much of *[The
    City of God](/wiki/The_City_of_God "The City of God")* is devoted to countering
    Pelagian arguments. Another major difference in the two thinkers was that Pelagius
    emphasized obedience to God for fear of hell, which Augustine considered servile.
    In contrast, Augustine argued that Christians should be motivated by the delight
    and blessings of the [Holy Spirit](/wiki/Holy_Spirit "Holy Spirit") and believed
    that it was treason "to do the right deed for the wrong reason". According to
    Augustine, credit for all virtue and good works is due to God alone, and to say
    otherwise caused arrogance, which is the foundation of sin.'

    of problems raised by the Christian religion". [John Cassian](/wiki/John_Cassian

    "Problem of evil") that invokes [libertarian free will](/wiki/Libertarian_free_will
    "Libertarian free will") as both the cause of human suffering and a sufficient
    good to justify it. By positing that man could choose between good and evil without
    divine intercession, Pelagianism brought into question Christianity's core doctrine
    of [Jesus](/wiki/Jesus "Jesus")' act of [substitutionary atonement](/wiki/Substitutionary_atonement
    "Substitutionary atonement") to expiate the sins of mankind. For this reason,
    Pelagianism became associated with [nontrinitarian](/wiki/Nontrinitarian "Nontrinitarian")
    interpretations of Christianity which rejected the [divinity of Jesus](/wiki/Divinity_of_Jesus
    "Divinity of Jesus"), as well as other heresies such as [Arianism](/wiki/Arianism

    "Mortalism") (which rejected the [existence of hell](/wiki/Hell_in_Christianity
    "Hell in Christianity")). Augustine argued that if man "could have become just
    by the law of nature and free will . . . amounts to rendering the cross of Christ
    void". He argued that no suffering was truly undeserved, and that grace was equally
    undeserved but bestowed by God's benevolence. Augustine's solution, while it was
    faithful to orthodox Christology, worsened the problem of evil because according
    to Augustinian interpretations, God punishes sinners who by their very nature
    are unable not to sin. The Augustinian defense of God's grace against accusations
    of arbitrariness is that God's ways are incomprehensible to mere mortals. Yet,
    as later critics such as [Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz](/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz
    "Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz") asserted, asking "[it is good and just because God
    wills it or whether God wills it because it is good and just](/wiki/Euthyphro_dilemma
    "Euthyphro dilemma")?", this defense (although accepted by many Catholic and [Reformed](/wiki/Reformed_tradition
    "Reformed tradition") theologians) creates a [God-centered morality](/wiki/Divine_command_theory

    God" and make him into a tyrant.

    the latter teaches that man has the choice to follow divine law. By teaching the
    absence of original sin and the idea that humans can choose between good and evil,
    Pelagianism advocated a position close to that of Judaism. Pelagius wrote positively
    of [Jews](/wiki/Jews "Jews") and Judaism, recommending that Christians study Old
    Testament (i.e., the Tanakh) [law](/wiki/Law_of_Moses "Law of Moses")—a sympathy
    not commonly encountered in Christianity after [Paul](/wiki/Paul_the_Apostle "Paul

    contemporary rabbinic literature tends to take a Pelagian perspective on the major
    questions, and it could be argued that the rabbis shared a [worldview](/wiki/Worldview
    "Worldview") with Pelagius, there were minority opinions within Judaism (such
    as the [Essenes](/wiki/Essenes "Essenes")) which argued for ideas more similar
    to Augustine's. Overall, Jewish discourse did not discuss free will and emphasized
    God's goodness in his revelation of the [Torah](/wiki/Torah "Torah").

    took Pelagian or Pelagian-adjacent positions on the problem of evil. For instance,
    Leibniz, who coined the word [theodicy](/wiki/Theodicy "Theodicy") in 1710, rejected
    Pelagianism but nevertheless proved to be "a crucial conduit for Pelagian ideas".
    He argued that "Freedom is deemed necessary in order that man may be deemed guilty
    and open to punishment." In *[De doctrina christiana](/wiki/De_doctrina_christiana_(Milton)
    "De doctrina christiana (Milton)")*, [John Milton](/wiki/John_Milton "John Milton")
    argued that "if, because of God's decree, man could not help but fall . . . then
    God's restoration of fallen man was a matter of justice not grace". Milton also
    argued for other positions that could be considered Pelagian, such as that "The
    knowledge and survey of vice, is in this world ... necessary to the constituting
    of human virtue." [Jean-Jacques Rousseau](/wiki/Jean-Jacques_Rousseau "Jean-Jacques

    with the Justice or Goodness of the Great and Infinite God". He did not accept

    "Hegelian dialectic"). He rarely mentioned Pelagius explicitly even though he
    inclined towards a Pelagian viewpoint. However, Kierkegaard rejected the idea
    that man could perfect himself.

    influenced his book *[A Theory of Justice](/wiki/A_Theory_of_Justice "A Theory
    of Justice")*, in which he argued that differences in productivity between humans
    are a result of "moral arbitrariness" and therefore unequal wealth is undeserved.
    In contrast, the Pelagian position would be that human sufferings are largely
    the result of sin and are therefore deserved. According to Nelson, many contemporary

    would at any rate appear that [Pelagius] was no more a heretic than Augustine.
    His fault was in exaggerated emphasis, but in the final form his philosophy took,
    after necessary and proper modifications as a result of criticism, it is not certain
    that any statement of his is totally irreconcilable with the Christian faith or
    indefensible in terms of the New Testament. It is by no means so clear that the

- en: An important result of the modern reappraisal of Pelagius's theology has been
    a more sympathetic assessment of his theology and doctrine of grace and the recognition
    of its deep rootedness in the antecedent Greek theologians... Pelagius's doctrine
    of grace, free will and predestination, as represented in his *Commentary on Romans*,
    has very strong links with Eastern (Greek) theology and, for the most part, these
    doctrines are no more reproachable than those of orthodox Greek theologians such
    as Origen and John Chrysostom, and of St. Jerome.
