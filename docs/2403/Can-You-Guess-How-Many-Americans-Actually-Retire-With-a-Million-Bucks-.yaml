    that much aside could make it easier to live your preferred lifestyle when you
    retire, without having to worry about running short of money. However, not a huge
    percentage of retirees end up having that much money. In fact, statistically,
    around 10% of retirees have $1 million or more in savings. The majority of retirees,
    however, have far less saved. If you’re looking to be in the minority but aren’t
    sure how to get started on that savings goal, consider working with a [financial
    advisor](https://smartasset.com/retirement/find-a-financial-planner?utm_source=syndication_yahoo&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=sma__falc_relevantbold&utm_content=whatpercentageofretireeshaveamilliondolllars&utm_term=rp).
