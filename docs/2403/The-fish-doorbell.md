**See a fish? Ring the bell!**

Welcome to the Fish Doorbell. Will you help fish pass the city boat lock?

Every spring fish migrate upstream, in search of places to spawn. They swim through the centre of  the city of Utrecht. Unfortunatly, the boat lock is closed during spring. You can help the fish.

**Do you see a fish? Press the Doorbell!**

All the photos are collected. When there are enough fish waiting, the lock will be opened.

**Ecologists Anne & Mark keep you updated on the Fish Doorbell**

It looks like the water clears up a bit. Last week we saw some nice sightings of carp, perch, eel and pike. The pike has finally started their migration. We saw mainly males so far, but also a beautiful shot of a male and female swimming next to each other. You can watch those back on the Fish doorbell News Report.

This week temperatures remain stable at around 11 degrees. That means it is still relatively cold. I don’t expect great numbers of fish this week, but since the migration for many species has started I think there will be plenty to see.

Don’t forget, you can watch previous fish sightings on the [Fish Doorbell News Report](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_0qh5wnYjwth74auOgEMPg?sub_confirmation=1).
