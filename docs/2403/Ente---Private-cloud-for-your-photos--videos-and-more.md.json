["```\nI am really positively surprised. The app works flawlessly and makes managing pictures and videos across multiple platforms (mobile, tablet, laptop, and web) very easy. In addition, all data is end to end encrypted, which was crucial for me to start using the app. The prices are really fair and there is a great team behind Ente that is incredibly open to feature suggestions. It's a pity that I didn't come across Ente earlier. In summary, Ente is a great alternative to the big cloud providers and is not lagging behind them. At the same time, Ente makes it possible to store data securely and privately, without the hassle that normally comes with it.\n```"]
