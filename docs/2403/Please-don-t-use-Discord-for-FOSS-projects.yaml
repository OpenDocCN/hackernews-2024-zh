    instant messaging needs of FOSS projects. In retrospect, this article is not very
    good, and in the years since, another proprietary chat fad has stepped up to bat:
    Discord. It’s time to revisit this discussion.'

- en: In short, using Discord for your free software/open source (FOSS) software project
    is a very bad idea. Free software matters — that’s why you’re writing it, after
    all. Using Discord partitions your community on either side of a walled garden,
    with one side that’s willing to use the proprietary Discord client, and one side
    that isn’t. It sets up users who are passionate about free software — i.e. your
    most passionate contributors or potential contributors — as second-class citizens.

    the proprietary Discord client is often a nightmare to use. ^(Users who cannot
    afford new enough hardware to make the resource-intensive client pleasant to use
    are also left by the wayside. Choosing Discord is a choice that excludes poor
    and disabled users from your community. Users of novel or unusual operating systems
    or devices (i.e. innovators and early adopters) are also locked out of the client
    until Discord sees fit to port it to their platform. Discord also declines service
    to users in countries under US sanctions, such as Iran. Privacy-concious users
    will think twice before using Discord to participate in your project, or will
    be denied outright if they rely on Tor or VPNs. All of these groups are excluded
    from your community.)

- en: These problems are driven by a conflict of interest between you and Discord.
    Ownership over your chat logs, the right to set up useful bots, or to moderate
    your project’s space according to your discretion; all of these are rights reserved
    by Discord and denied to you. The FOSS community, including users with accessibility
    needs or low-end computing devices, are unable to work together to innovate on
    the proprietary client, or to build improved clients which better suit their needs,
    because Discord insists on total control over the experience. Discord seeks to
    [domesticate its users](https://seirdy.one/2021/01/27/whatsapp-and-the-domestication-of-users.html),
    where FOSS treats users as peers and collaborators. These ideologies are fundamentally
    in conflict with one another.

- en: You are making an investment when you choose to use one service over another.
    When you choose Discord, you are legitimizing their platform and divesting from
    FOSS platforms. Even if you think they have a bigger reach and a bigger audience,
    ^(choosing them is a short-term, individualist play which signals a lack of faith
    in and support for the long-term goals of the FOSS ecosystem as a whole. The FOSS
    ecosystem needs your investment. FOSS platforms generally don’t have access to
    venture capital or large marketing budgets, and are less willing to use dark patterns
    and predatory tactics to secure their market segment. They need your support to
    succeed, and you need theirs. Why should someone choose to use your FOSS project
    when you refused to choose theirs? Solidarity and mutual support is the key to
    success.)

- en: There are great FOSS alternatives to Discord or Slack. SourceHut has been investing
    in IRC by building more accessible services like [chat.sr.ht](https://sourcehut.org/blog/2021-11-29-announcing-the-chat.sr.ht-public-beta/).
    Other great options include [Matrix](https://matrix.org) and [Zulip](https://zulip.com).
    Please consider these services before you reach for their proprietary competitors.

    This article is much the same if we replace “Discord” with “GitHub”, for instance,
    or “Twitter” or “YouTube”. If your project depends on proprietary infrastructure,
    I want you to have a serious discussion with your collaborators about why. What
    do your choices mean for the long-term success of your project and the ecosystem
    in which it resides? Are you making smart investments, or just using tools which
    are popular or that you’re already used to?

    If you use Twitter, consider [Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org) instead. If
    you use YouTube, try [PeerTube](https://joinpeertube.org). If you use Facebook…
    don’t.)
