    social media monitoring, and radio eavesdropping by an array of state, local,
    and federal agencies, according to attorneys’ interviews with law enforcement.
    The FBI infiltration fits into a longer history in the region. In the 1970s, the
    FBI infiltrated the highest levels of the American Indian Movement, or AIM.

    oil pipeline drew thousands of people seeking to protect water, the climate, and
    Indigenous sovereignty. For seven months, participants protested to stop construction
    of the pipeline and were met by militarized law enforcement, at times facing tear
    gas, rubber bullets, and water hoses in below-freezing weather.

    federal government for more than $38 million — the cost the state claims to have
    spent on police and other emergency responders, and for property and environmental
    damage. Central to North Dakota’s complaints are the existence of anti-pipeline
    camps on federal land managed by the Army Corps of Engineers. The state argues
    that by failing to enforce trespass laws on that land, the Army Corps allowed
    the camps to grow to up to 8,000 people and serve as a “safe haven” for those
    who participated in illegal activity during protests and caused property damage.

    is so deleterious to social movements, because these movements for Indigenous
    people are typically based on kinship networks and forms of relationality,” said
    Nick Estes, a historian and member of the Lower Brule Sioux Tribe who spent time
    at the Standing Rock resistance camps and has extensively researched the infiltration
    of the AIM movement by the FBI. Beyond his relationship with Fallis, Harmon had
    close familial ties with community leaders and had participated in important ceremonies.
    Infiltration, Estes said, “turns relatives against relatives.”

    the FBI’s supervisor for the western half of North Dakota during the Standing
    Rock protests, the FBI was infiltrating the NoDAPL movement weeks before the protests
    gained international media attention and attracted thousands. By August 16, 2016,
    the FBI had tasked at least one “confidential human source” with gathering information.
    The FBI eventually had five to 10 informants in the protest camps — “probably
    closer to 10,” said Bob Perry, assistant special agent in charge of the FBI’s
    Minneapolis field office, which oversees operations in the Dakotas, in another
    deposition. The number of FBI informants at Standing Rock was first reported by
    the [North Dakota Monitor](https://northdakotamonitor.com/2024/02/22/lack-of-federal-support-overwhelmed-law-enforcement-during-dapl-officials-testify/).

    Perry added, “We would give them essentially a list: ‘Violence, potential violence,
    criminal activity.’ To some point it was health and safety as well, because, you

    into the camps undercover. O’Connell denied the claim. “There were no undercover
    agents used at all, ever.” He confirmed, however, that he and other agents did
    visit the camps routinely. For the first couple months of the protests, O’Connell
    himself arrived at the camps soon after dawn most days, wearing outdoorsy clothing
    from REI or Dick’s Sporting Goods. “Being plainclothes, we could kind of slink
    around and, you know, do what we had to do,” he said. O’Connell would chat with
    whomever he ran into. Although he sometimes handed out his card, he didn’t always
    identify himself as FBI. “If people didn’t ask, I didn’t tell them,” he said.

    and Ward’s deposition indicates that the pair raised concerns with the U.S. marshal
    about the safety of entering the camps without local police knowing. Despite its
    efforts, the FBI uncovered no widespread criminal activity beyond personal drug
    use and “misdemeanor-type activity,” O’Connell said in his deposition.
