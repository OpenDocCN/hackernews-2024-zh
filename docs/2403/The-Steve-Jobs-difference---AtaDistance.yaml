    known but I’ve enjoyed watching the *[NO WIRES: How the Apple Airport Changed
    Everything](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EhBxWHrG7K8&t=688s)* YouTube video
    posted by [The Serial Port](https://www.youtube.com/@theserialport). It’s covers
    the development of the slowly emerging [IEEE 802.11 WiFi standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.11)
    and how the Steve Jobs Apple beat everybody else in the market in making WiFi
    standard in personal computers. The lesser known Apple AirPort story is a great
    reminder of how Steve Jobs saved Apple and made it relevant again by innovating
    with small groups of highly focused people and a highly focused product line.
    He elegantly distilled the essence of this simple strategy in his [last All Things
    D appearance in 2010](https://youtu.be/i5f8bqYYwps?si=_g63RMhG7y-XhmCm&t=256):'

    world, and the way we’ve succeeded is by choosing what horses to ride really carefully,
    technically. We look for these technical vectors that have a future…We try to
    pick things that are in their (technological) springs. And if you choose wisely,
    you can save yourself an enormous amount of work versus trying to do everything.
    And you can really put energy into making those new emerging technologies be great
    on your platform rather than just okay because you’re spreading yourself too thin.

    wisely and staying focused. When I read about the [10 billion disaster that was
    the failed Apple Car development effort](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2024-03-06/apple-car-s-crash-design-details-tim-cook-s-indecision-failed-tesla-deal),
    I can’t help but think that current Apple leadership has abandoned all the entrepreneurship
    wisdom of their former CEO and co-founder.
