- en: A team of researchers from The University of New Mexico's Museum of Southwestern
    Biology (MSB) have reported unexpectedly high levels of chemical contamination
    in wild birds and mammals at Holloman Air Force Base, near Alamogordo, N.M. in
    [new research](https://authors.elsevier.com/a/1icAg3Ao67R8u) published in *Environmental
    Research*.

- en: The research found that animals were heavily contaminated with several [harmful
    compounds](https://phys.org/tags/harmful+compounds/) known as "forever chemicals,"
    or per and poly-fluoroalkyl substances (PFAS). Even low concentrations of PFAS
    are known to cause cancer and developmental, reproductive, immune system, and
    endocrine problems in animals and people.

- en: Although PFAS have been found in various wildlife worldwide, the new findings
    are unprecedented for exceptionally high concentrations across numerous species.
    Across 23 species of birds and mammals, PFAS concentrations averaged in the tens
    of thousands of parts per billion. To put this in perspective, the research team
    pointed out that thousands of dairy cattle in Clovis, N.M., recently had to be
    destroyed because their milk was contaminated at less than six parts per billion.

    Air Force Base and White Sands National Park, in the middle of the vast, dry Tularosa
    basin. The lake is part of a system of waste-water catchment ponds that the Air
    Force created.

    waterbirds —over 100 species and tens of thousands of individuals use these habitats
    annually," Witt explained. "The wetlands are also heavily used by people for recreation
    and hunting."'

- en: The leading cause of contamination is thought to be the fire-fighting foam that
    was deployed over decades by the U.S. Air Force. The foam contained a mix of toxic
    PFAS that have since been phased out of manufacturing. Starting around 1970, the
    foam was widely used for training exercises at military installations. At Holloman
    A.F.B., runoff flowed into the waste-water catchments.

    and mud," said Research Associate in the MSB Division of Mammals and Research
    Professor in the Department of Biology Jean-Luc Cartron, a co-author on the study.
    "These substances also bind to proteins, so they were easily taken up by living
    creatures and then passed up the [food chain](https://phys.org/tags/food+chain/)."'

- en: To understand PFAS movement through the food web at Holloman Lake, the research
    team conducted over 2000 measurements, testing for the various compounds in different
    species and tissue types. The team focused on aquatic birds because of their heavy
    exposure to contaminated water and because they are sought after by hunters.

    would not be directly exposed to the water; thus, their potential contamination
    would reveal other avenues of PFAS movement.
