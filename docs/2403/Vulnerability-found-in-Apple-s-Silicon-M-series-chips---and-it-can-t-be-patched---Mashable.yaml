    Mac and MacBook computers – and the worst part is that it's unpatchable.

    in a new window)") the vulnerability, first reported by [Ars Technica](https://arstechnica.com/security/2024/03/hackers-can-extract-secret-encryption-keys-from-apples-mac-chips/
    "(opens in a new window)"), which allows hackers to gain access to secret encryption
    keys on Apple computers with Apple's new Silicon M-Series chipset. This includes
    the M1, M2, and M3 Apple MacBook and Mac computer models.

- en: The issue lies with *prefetchers* — components meant to predictively retrieve
    data before a request to increase processing speed — and the opening they leave
    for malicious attacks from bad actors.

- en: The researchers have dubbed the attack "GoFetch," which they describe as "a
    microarchitectural side-channel attack that can extract secret keys from constant-time
    cryptographic implementations via data memory-dependent prefetchers (DMPs)."

    that's left vulnerable due to the design of a computer protocol or algorithm.

    data) and try to guess future addresses that might be useful. The DMP is different
    in this sense as in addition to addresses it also uses the data values in order
    to make predictions (predict addresses to go to and prefetch). In particular,
    if a data value "looks like" a pointer, it will be treated as an "address" (where
    in fact it's actually not!) and the data from this "address" will be brought to
    the cache. The arrival of this address into the cache is visible, leaking over
    cache side channels.

- en: Our attack exploits this fact. We cannot leak encryption keys directly, but
    what we can do is manipulate intermediate data inside the encryption algorithm
    to look like a pointer via a chosen input attack. The DMP then sees that the data
    value "looks like" an address, and brings the data from this "address" into the
    cache, which leaks the "address." We don’t care about the data value being prefetched,
    but the fact that the intermediate data looked like an address is visible via
    a cache channel and is sufficient to reveal the secret key over time.

- en: Basically, the researchers discovered that the DMPs in Apple's Silicon chipsets
    – M1, M2 and, M3 – can give hackers access to sensitive information, like secret
    encryption keys. The DMPs can be weaponized to get around security found in cryptography
    apps, and they can do so quickly too. For example, the researchers were able to
    extract an 2048-bit RSA key in under one hour.

    issue with a software fix. However, the researchers say this one is unpatchable
    because the issue lies with the "microarchitectural" design of the chip. Furthermore,
    security measures taken to help mitigate the issue would require a serious degradation
    of the M-series chips' performance.

    first brought their findings to Apple's attention on December 5, 2023\. They waited
    107 days before disclosing their research to the public.
