    to have obesity, a new study finds.

- en: Obesity rates grew particularly fast among children and teens, quadrupling from
    1990 to 2022, the latest year the analysis looked at, while rates among adults
    more than doubled. That comes to 159 million children and teens with obesity,
    and 879 million adults, according to the study, [published](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(23)02750-2/fulltext)
    Thursday in the Lancet and conducted by the NCD Risk Factor Collaboration, a group
    of researchers around the world studying noncommunicable diseases.

    of the biggest increases in youth obesity rates occurred in Polynesia and Micronesia
    and the Caribbean. Latin America and the Middle East and North Africa are also
    experiencing much more obesity than underweight, the study said.

- en: The new data highlight how [the global burden of obesity](https://www.statnews.com/2023/06/08/bmi-slowdown-severe-obesity-global-rates/)
    is evolving. Obesity, and other chronic diseases like [diabetes](https://www.statnews.com/2023/06/22/global-diabetes-surpass-billion-lancet/),
    have traditionally been associated with high-income countries, but they’re increasingly
    affecting low- and middle-income countries as well, as those regions rapidly shift
    to industrialized lifestyles with diets of processed foods and reduced physical
    activity. And after obesity rates started rising among adults over the past few
    decades, the same trends are now occurring younger in life, among children and
    teens.

    like Wegovy and Zepbound have stoked excitement among many doctors as a new way
    to address rising obesity rates. But the treatments are costly, have repeatedly
    fallen into shortages and so far have only launched in a few high-income countries.

    a solution to the problem,” Francesco Branca, director of nutrition and food safety
    at the World Health Organization, said in a press briefing discussing the study.
    “The solution still is in the transformation of food systems and the environment,
    such that obesity can be prevented.”

    Ezzati, a professor at Imperial College London who leads the NCD Risk Factor Collaboration.
    “‘Needing the most’ is both a clinical decision, but also a question for health
    care systems to make sure that they reach those people without overdue financial
    burden.”

    the world. It defined obesity for adults as having a body-mass index above 30
    and underweight as a BMI under 18.5\. For children and teens, obesity was defined
    as being two standard deviations higher than typical growth trends and underweight
    is two standard deviations below.

    and underweight across the entire global population, even though emerging data
    suggest that it might be more suitable to use different cutoffs for each demographic
    group. For example, South Asian people tend to develop diabetes and heart complications
    at lower BMIs than white people.

    compare across different populations and BMI was the best measurement that could
    be analyzed using available data. “The results in terms of the overall global
    patterns are probably unaffected by the choice of the metric,” he said, but it
    is important to continue to study how the measurement should be used across different
    demographics.

    decades. Large decreases in youth underweight rates occurred in south and southeast
    Asia and sub-Saharan Africa, but those regions still have among the highest rates
    of underweight in the world, the study found.

    alongside the increases in obesity, especially since populations can rapidly transition
    from being underweight to overweight, as both are related to having inadequate
    access to nutritious foods.

    nutrition early in life such as by promoting breastfeeding, regulating food marketing,
