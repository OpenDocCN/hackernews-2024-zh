    have traditionally been associated with high-income countries, but they’re increasingly
    affecting low- and middle-income countries as well, as those regions rapidly shift
    to industrialized lifestyles with diets of processed foods and reduced physical
    activity. And after obesity rates started rising among adults over the past few
    decades, the same trends are now occurring younger in life, among children and
