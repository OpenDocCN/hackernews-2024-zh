    control team on Earth, that signal has not carried any usable data since November,
    which has pointed to an issue with one of the spacecraft’s three onboard computers.

    team may be making progress in its quest to understand what Voyager 1 is experiencing.
    Voyager 1 is currently the farthest spacecraft from Earth at about 15 billion
    miles (24 billion kilometers) away.

    kilometers) from our planet. Both are in interstellar space and are the only spacecraft
    ever to operate beyond the heliosphere, the sun’s bubble of magnetic fields and
    particles that extends well beyond the orbit of Pluto.

    spacecraft in history. Their exceptionally long life spans mean that both spacecraft

    their preliminary goals of flying by Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune decades
    ago.

    system stood out from the rest of the garbled data. While the signal wasn’t in
    the format the Voyager team is used to when the flight data system is functioning
    as expected, an engineer with NASA’s Deep Space Network was able to decode it.

    to do, as well as variables, or values used in the code that can change based
    on commands or the spacecraft’s status,” according to a NASA blog post. “It also
    contains science or engineering data for downlink. The team will compare this
    readout to the one that came down before the issue arose and look for discrepancies
    in the code and the variables to potentially find the source of the ongoing issue.”

    to reach the spacecraft. Additionally, the team must wait 45 hours to receive
    a response. Currently, the team is analyzing Voyager 1’s memory readout after
    initially beginning the decoding process on March 7 and finding the readout three
    days later.
