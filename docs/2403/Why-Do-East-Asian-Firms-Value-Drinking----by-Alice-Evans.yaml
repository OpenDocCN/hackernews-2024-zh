    is thus implicit and indirect. Conflict aversion and emotional suppression make
    it harder to learn what someone else really thinks. So what’s the solution?

    and information-sharing. As argued in Edward Slingerland’s book “[Drunk](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Drunk-Sipped-Danced-Stumbled-Civilization/dp/0316453382)”,
    it benefits businesses! But this exact same cognitive shift also elevates risks
    of sexual abuse. Women may prefer to leave early. By doing so, they miss out on
    homosocial boozing and schmoozing.
