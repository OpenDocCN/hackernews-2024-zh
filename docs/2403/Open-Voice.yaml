- en: We introduce OpenVoice, a versatile instant voice cloning approach that requires
    only a short audio clip from the reference speaker to replicate their voice and
    generate speech in multiple languages. OpenVoice enables granular control over
    voice styles, including emotion, accent, rhythm, pauses, and intonation, in addition
    to replicating the tone color of the reference speaker. OpenVoice also achieves
    zero-shot cross-lingual voice cloning for languages not included in the massive-speaker
    training set. OpenVoice is also computationally efficient, costing tens of times
    less than commercially available APIs that offer even inferior performance. The
    technical report and source code can be found at [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.01479.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.01479.pdf)

    as well as other style parameters including rhythm, pauses, and intonation. Here
    we demonstrate the control over emotion and accent of the generated voice.
