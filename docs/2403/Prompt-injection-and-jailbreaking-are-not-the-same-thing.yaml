    it’s *not prompt injection*. That’s why [I called it prompt injection in the first

  prefs:

    the stakes involved in defending against them—are very different.

    a model into saying something embarrassing, screenshots the output and causes
    a nasty PR incident.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A theoretical worst case risk from jailbreaking is that the model helps the
    user perform an actual crime—making and using napalm, for example—which they would
    not have been able to do without the model’s help. I don’t think I’ve heard of
    any real-world examples of this happening yet—sufficiently motivated bad actors
    have plenty of existing sources of information.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    not against the models themselves, it’s against **applications that are built
    on those models**.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    Prompt injection isn’t a single attack—it’s the name for a whole category of exploits.
