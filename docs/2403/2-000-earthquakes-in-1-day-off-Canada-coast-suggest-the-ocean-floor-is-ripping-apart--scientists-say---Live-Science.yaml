    earlier this month, which could be a sign that new oceanic crust is about to be
    birthed via a deep sea magmatic rupture.

- en: The quakes aren't any threat to people. They're relatively small and centered
    on a spot called the Endeavour site, about 150 miles (240 kilometers) off the
    coast of Vancouver Island. This spot hosts a number of hydrothermal vents and
    sits on the Juan de Fuca Ridge, where the ocean floor is spreading apart. This
    area is separate from the [subduction zone](https://www.livescience.com/43220-subduction-zone-definition.html)
    — a region where one tectonic plate is sinking into the mantle underneath another
    plate — closer to the coast that can create large, destructive earthquakes, said
    [Zoe Krauss](https://zoekrauss.github.io/), a doctoral candidate in marine geophysics
    in the University of Washington.

    not too far above a magnitude five," Krauss told Live Science. "This is not going
    to trigger ''the big one'' on the subduction zone."'

- en: The quakes are interesting scientifically because they can reveal details about
    how the ocean floor pulls apart and new crust forms, Krauss said. At the Endeavour
    site, the Pacific plate and the Juan de Fuca plate are pulling apart. This stretching
    creates long, linear fault lines and thins the crust, enabling magma to rise up.
    When the magma reaches the surface, it cools and hardens, becoming new ocean crust.

    Time-series Undersea Networked Experiments (NEPTUNE), run by Ocean Networks Canada.
    Since 2018, the region has become more seismically active, Krauss said. On March
    6, however, the activity went wild, with at least 200 small earthquakes shaking
    the seafloor per hour. In all, the researchers detected about 1,850 quakes in
    a single day.

    Krauss said. "But it’s pretty cool because it allows us to track where things
    are happening, where things are breaking and where things are moving around."'

- en: Krauss said the most likely reason for the quakes is that the seafloor is stretched
    to its maximum extent and has built up a great deal of stress. At the Endeavour
    site, this happens when the plates pull apart by about 3.3 feet (1 meter), she
    said, and the stress is ultimately relieved when magma rises up into the thinned
    crust and cools.

    right on schedule: The last time it was this seismically shaky was in 2005.'

- en: Since March 6, the earthquake activity has calmed down, though at a slightly
    heightened background level, Krauss said. She and her colleagues are now watching
    closely. The continuous monitoring of the Endeavour site began in 2011, so the
    team hasn't had access to near real-time data of a magma intrusion like this before.
    They have many questions, ranging from the impact on the hydrothermal vent system
    to the source for the magma that will ultimately form the new crust.

    why do these events start where they start, and what exactly is the trigger that
    brings magma in?" Krauss said. For now, she and her team are waiting to see what
    happens next.'
