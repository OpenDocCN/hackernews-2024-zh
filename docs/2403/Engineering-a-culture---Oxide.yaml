    we had a bug — a regression — and the team quickly jumped on it, getting it root
    caused and fixed. But on the other, this particular issue was something of an
    Oxide object lesson, representative not just of the technologies but also of the
    culture we have built here. I wasn’t the only person who thought so, and two of
    my colleagues wrote terrific blog entries with their perspectives:'

    problem; if it’s clear in hindsight, it certainly wasn’t at the time! (In Matt’s
    evocative words: "One morning, I had a revelation.") I first learned of Matt’s
    work when he demonstrated it during our weekly [Demo Friday](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RR6hFE_jDU#t=6),
    an hour-long unstructured session to demo our work for one another. Demo Friday
    is such an essential part of Oxide’s culture that it feels like we have always
    done it, but in fact it took us nearly two years into the company’s life to get
    there: over the spring and summer of 2021, our colleague Sean Klein had instituted
    regular demos for the area that he works on (the [Oxide control plane](https://github.com/oxidecomputer/omicron)),
    and others around the company — seeing the energy that came from it — asked if
    they, too, could start regular demos for their domain. But instead of doing it
    group by group, we instituted it company-wide starting in the fall of 2021: an
    unstructured hour once a week in which anyone can demo anything.'

    no demo is too small — and we have often found that a demo that feels small to
    someone in the thick of work will feel extraordinary to someone outside of it.
    ("I have a small demo building on the work of a lot of other people" has been
    heard so frequently that it has become something of an inside joke.) Demo Friday
    is important because it gets to one of our most important drivers as technologists:
    **the esteem of our peers**. The thrill that you get from showing work to your
    colleagues is unparalleled — and their wonderment in return is uniquely inspiring.
    (Speaking personally, Matt’s demo addressed a problem that I had personally had
    many times over in working on Hubris — and I was one of the many [w00ts in the
    chat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W00t), excited to see his creative solution!)'

    shared empathy and teamwork but also our curiosity and versatility: it’s really
    inspiring to have (say) one colleague show how they used [PCB backdrilling](https://www.protoexpress.com/blog/back-drilling-pcb-design-and-manufacturing/)
    for signal integrity, and the next show an integration they built using [Dropshot](https://github.com/oxidecomputer/dropshot)
    between our CRM and spinning up a demonstration environment for a customer. And
    this is more than just idle intellectual curiosity: our stack is deep — spanning
    both hardware and software — and the demos make for a fun and engaging way to
    learn about aspects of the system that we don’t normally work on.'

    but it’s hard to separate Hubris from the team that built it. Oxide’s engineering
    team has essentially no internal silos. Our culture rewards openness, curiosity,
    and communication, and discourages defensiveness, empire-building, and gatekeeping.
    We’ve worked hard to create and defend this culture, and I think it shows in the
    way we organized horizontally, across the borders of what other organizations
    would call teams, to solve this mystery.'

    that first cultural cornerstone was very important to us — starting with [our
    mission, principles, and values](https://oxide.computer/principles). Critically,
    by using our mission, principles, and values as the foundation for [our hiring

    "openness, curiosity, and communication" within an organization, the only drawback
    is that it’s hard work: culture has to be deliberate without being overly prescriptive,
    and that can be a tricky balance. In this regard, building a culture is very different
    than building (say) software: it is not engineered in a traditional sense, but
    is rather a gooey, squishy, organism that will evolve over time. But the reward
    of the effort is something that its participants care intensely about: it will
    continue to be (in Cliff’s words) a culture that we work hard to not just create
    but defend!'
