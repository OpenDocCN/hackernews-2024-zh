    that the scribbles of a wizard not only transcend the mundane but are, without
    a shadow of a doubt, the most exhilarating form of notation known to humanoid
    kind. For who could resist the allure of a well-placed spell in the margins?

- en: magick.css is a minimalistic, (mostly) classless CSS framework that is designed
    to be easy to use and easy to understand. It is contained in a single file, and
    every choice is commented. The goal is to achieve an elegant, but magically playful
    look, while maximizing readability and the ability to convey information; *somewhat
    akin to the notes of a wizard*.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The framework retains its beauty and functionality across **all devices** and
    screen sizes, and works entirely **without JavaScript**. It is inspired by [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/),
    old school TTRPG rulebooks, CSS frameworks like [concrete.css](https://concrete.style/)
    and [Tufte CSS](https://edwardtufte.github.io/tufte-css/) and the "usability as
    design" ethic of brutalism.
