    leaders, as well as lead engineering teams myself. These experiences have primarily
    been in the context of startups that are growing rapidly in terms of both customers
    and employees. The longer I have worked in these environments, the more convinced
    I have become that there is a singular skill that ultimately decides the success
    of a leader, and thus their team: **pacing**.'

  zh: 我非常幸运能够与一些令人难以置信的工程领导者一起工作，并且自己也领导过工程团队。这些经历主要发生在快速增长客户和员工规模的初创公司中。我在这些环境中工作的时间越长，我就越相信有一个决定领导成功的独特技能，从而决定团队的成功：**配速**。
- en: As an [avid endurance runner](https://danielmangum.com/posts/3000-miles-2023/),
    I am very familiar with the importance of good pacing, and the perils of doing
    it poorly. If you go out too hard in a race, you are destined to crash and burn.
    On the other hand, if you start too slow, you may have too much time to make up
    before the end of the race. At every moment throughout a run, you need to be in-tune
    with your body, understanding the limits of how hard you can push given your current
    position in the race.

  zh: 作为[狂热的耐力跑者](https://danielmangum.com/posts/3000-miles-2023/)，我对良好配速的重要性以及糟糕执行配速的危险性非常熟悉。如果你在比赛中出发太快，注定会崩溃。另一方面，如果开始得太慢，你可能需要在比赛结束前补足太多时间。在跑步过程中的每一刻，你都需要与自己的身体保持一致，了解在当前比赛中的位置下能够推动得有多猛烈的极限。
- en: However, when leading a team, you must not only be in-tune with your own abilities
    and stamina, but also that of the members of your team. Push too hard and you
    are likely to see degraded product quality, and eventually employee attrition.
    Don’t push hard enough and you’ll run out of money before you can acquire enough
    customers or raise your next round of funding. Either extreme can be fatal.

  zh: 然而，当领导团队时，你不仅需要了解自己的能力和耐力，还需要了解团队成员的情况。过度施压很可能导致产品质量下降，并最终导致员工流失。如果不够努力，你可能会在能够获取足够客户或筹集下一轮资金之前用光所有资金。任何一个极端都可能是致命的。
- en: The key to finding the right balance is honesty, transparency, and constant
    measurement. Ambiguity regarding the critical metrics for the business is like
    running a race with a blindfold; you can’t see the competition and you don’t know
    your own time. You are likely to be late to make adjustments, and when an adjustment
    is made, it is likely to be an over-correction. Many times, the over-correction
    is what ultimately leads to the downfall of an organization because it compounds
    the issue rather than mitigating it. I have seen minor incidents cause massive
    upheaval in engineering process, when a small adjustment would have addressed
    the issue. Similarly, I have seen engineering values and rigor be thrown out the
    window in the face of narrowly missing customer acquisition or revenue targets.

  zh: 找到正确平衡的关键在于诚实、透明和持续测量。在业务关键指标存在模糊不清的情况下，就像是戴上眼罩参加比赛；你看不见竞争对手，也不知道自己的时间。你很可能会迟到以进行调整，而一旦调整，很可能会过度修正。许多时候，过度修正是导致组织失败的原因，因为它加剧了问题而非减轻了问题。我曾看到一些小事件在工程流程中引起巨大的动荡，而如果进行了小调整，则问题可能会得到解决。同样地，我曾看到在接近未能达到客户获取或收入目标时，工程价值和严谨被抛诸脑后。
- en: It is not enough for leaders to be honest with their teams. They must also cultivate
    an environment in which the team is honest with them. I myself have been guilty
    of telling an engineering leader that I am feeling good, when in reality I was
    tired, stressed, and questioning whether I could maintain my current pace. In
    that specific situation, I did not feel as though there was an unhealthy atmosphere
    that made me fear being honest about my current status, but in many cases there
    is.

  zh: 领导者不能仅仅对团队诚实就足够。他们还必须营造一个团队能够诚实对待他们的环境。我自己曾经撒过一个谎，告诉一位工程领导者我感觉很好，但实际上我感到疲惫、压力重重，并且怀疑自己能否维持目前的速度。在那种特定情况下，我并没有感觉到有一种不健康的氛围让我害怕对自己当前状态诚实，但在许多情况下却存在这种情况。
- en: Frequently this pressure can be the result of a heavy emphasis on meeting a
    time-based goal. I am a firm believer in the importance of setting goals and delivering
    on time, but I also believe that the notion that this inherently leads to a more
    stressful environment is a false dichotomy and, quite honestly, a lack of creativity.
    As an engineering leader, my first step when it appears that we may fall short
    of a goal is to enumerate the options available to us. Often it is the case that
    a relatively small change in scope or architecture can get us back on course.

  zh: 经常这种压力可能是时间目标的强调结果。我坚信设定目标并按时交付的重要性，但我也相信这种观念本质上会导致更加紧张的环境是一种错误的二分法，而且，坦率地说，也是缺乏创造力的表现。作为工程领导者，当我们可能未能达到目标时，我的第一步是列举我们可用的选项。通常情况下，稍微改变范围或架构就能让我们重新上轨道。
- en: My second step is to name the repercussions of missing the goal. We as humans
    are prone to “catastrophizing”, which can lead to our level of stress becoming
    incommensurate with the reality of a situation. Consequences for shortcomings
    are real, but one of the worst mistakes an engineering leader can make is allowing
    for team members to feel their employment hangs in the balance when that is not
    the case. The inverse is also true when a team member’s employment *is* at risk.

  zh: 我的第二步是命名错过目标的后果。我们作为人类往往倾向于“灾难化”，这可能导致我们的压力水平与情况的现实情况不成比例。缺点的后果是真实的，但工程领导者可能犯的最严重的错误之一是让团队成员感觉自己的就业处于悬崖边缘，而实际情况并非如此。反之亦然，当一个团队成员的就业*确实*处于危险之中时。
- en: Missing a goal is not necessarily signal that your pace is too slow. In fact,
    it often means that you simply didn’t plan well for a more difficult portion of
    the race. Recalibrate appropriately and remember the pain of that moment in future
    planning. One of the joys of working at startups is that the course is full of
    hills, sharp turns, and inclement weather. A leader who can pace a team through
    those harsh conditions can meaningfully shift the probability of success of the
    company.

  zh: 错过目标不一定表明你的步伐太慢。事实上，这通常意味着你没有为比赛中更难的部分做好充分的计划。适当重新校准，并记住未来规划中那一刻的痛苦。在创业公司工作的乐趣之一是这条路充满了坡道、急转弯和恶劣天气。一个能够在这些严酷条件下带领团队的领导者可以显著地提高公司成功的概率。
