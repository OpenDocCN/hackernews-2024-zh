    exchange and the Alameda Research trading firm, was convicted in early November
    on seven charges of fraud and conspiracy. His investigation and trial, along with
    the ongoing bankruptcy proceedings surrounding his once multibillion-dollar businesses,
    helped to shine a light on the shady workings of an industry that has largely
    evaded regulation and oversight since its inception. Although FTX’s business practices
    have shocked those who are used to the more heavily regulated world of traditional
    finance, trial testimony and bankruptcy filings – along with similar filings from
    other failed cryptocurrency businesses – have highlighted that what happened at
    FTX is business as usual in cryptocurrency.

    of the same office, despite the clear conflicts of interest that stem from sharing
    the roles of exchange, market maker and asset custodian. Customer funds that were
    meant to be safeguarded were instead pooled with corporate assets and then spent
    with reckless abandon on everything from Bahamian real estate to Super Bowl advertisements
    to investments in companies operated by personal friends. Employees blurred lines
    between personal and professional, with Bankman-Fried’s longtime, on-and-off girlfriend
    Caroline Ellison also serving as one of his top lieutenants. She later testified
    that their tumultuous relationship contributed to the dysfunction at the firms
    and to her decision to become a co-conspirator in FTX’s fraud. (She is also awaiting
    sentencing after pleading guilty to seven charges.) The CEO of another cryptocurrency
    firm that loaned money to Bankman-Fried’s companies [testified](https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2023/10/13/sbf-trial-crypto-lender-blockfi-believed-alameda-was-solvent-given-balance-sheet-it-was-shown-ceo-testifies/)
    that he based his entire due diligence process on unaudited financial statements.
    He said this was the norm for the company’s crypto counterparties “because of
    issues with getting audits”. It bankrupted his company.

    and many others like him throughout 2022, stemmed not from proactive regulators
    protecting investors by cracking down on widespread malfeasance, but rather from
    the enormous implosions of the cryptocurrency firms built on rickety, risky loans
    and illusory tokens. These collapses were devastating to those who had been convinced
    that putting their money into cryptocurrency was a worthwhile investment. It was
    more akin to gambling. More than a few people believed that the firms who held
    their crypto tokens were regulated much like traditional banks. When the tokens
    disappeared, many were shocked at the absence of protections by regulatory agencies,
    and some were even surprised to find they had no depository insurance like what
    would shield them in the event of a bank failure.

    then plummeted in 2014 with the explosive growth and catastrophic collapse of
    the Mt Gox cryptocurrency exchange, which lost hundreds of thousands of bitcoins
    due to a combination of theft and mismanagement. Ten years later, most of those
    who had tokens stored on the Mt Gox exchange are still waiting to see any reimbursement
    for assets that would be worth billions today. Another crypto bubble in 2017 ended
    in a crash as regulators wised up to “initial coin offerings”: a trendy, scam-filled
    strategy that allowed companies to avoid the disclosures and oversight that generally
    come along with seeking investments from the public. Regulators and law enforcement
    agencies were still filing enforcement actions against the 2017-era ICO scammers
    when cryptocurrency entered its next mania in 2020 and 2021\. And now, as crypto
    prices inflate once more, these same agencies are on their back feet, seemingly
    too busy prosecuting malfeasance from previous years to focus on the present day.'

    past disasters, their attempts to impose more investor protections on the sector
    have been furiously opposed by the crypto industry, even as the industry loudly
    proclaims to want more regulation. Legislators, emboldened by the support of powerful
    and well-resourced crypto lobbying groups, have helped to [stymie rule changes](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-02-15/as-bitcoin-rallies-banks-push-sec-to-change-an-accounting-guideline-sab-121?sref=fqqmZ8gi)
    that could help agencies be more preventive than reactive. When it comes to new
    legislation, lawmakers have been deadlocked on bill after bill as industry interests
    pressure them to codify the current state of lax regulation with carve-outs and
    loopholes. The crypto industry argues this will allow for continued “innovation”
    – despite little innovation to date from the sector, aside from finding new and
    inventive ways to scam people out of their money.
