- en: '***Update:** Audi issued a statement noting that the upcoming 2025 A3 in the
    US will have “the same offer structure for Function on Demand as the previous
    2024 model year.” That means only enhanced navigation with Audi’s Virtual Cockpit
    and adaptive cruise control will be offered as subscriptions. Dual-zone climate
    control and high-beam assist won’t be offered as subscriptions in the US. Specifics
    will be available closer to the A3’s launch in the US.*'

- en: The [Audi A3](https://www.motor1.com/audi/a3-sedan/) is a survivor. The compact
    luxury car has been around in one form or another since 1996, and an updated version
    is coming to the US for the 2025 model year. But it's loaded with annoying in-car
    subscriptions.

- en: At first glance, this new A3 looks a lot like the car it replaces. The hexagonal
    [Singleframe grille](https://www.motor1.com/news/708892/audi-new-design-boss/)—in
    line with Audi's latest designs—is its biggest change, joined by bigger air intakes
    at the base of the bumper, an Audi logo high on the nose, and refreshed LED and
    matrix LED headlights with four customizable daytime lighting signatures. The
    rear bumper design, inspired by the [RS3](https://www.motor1.com/audi/rs3-sedan/),
    has a new LED taillight treatment, a black accent piece, and a mesh insert at
    the base.

    digital instrument cluster from last year carry over, but now you'll have to pay
    an in-car subscription fee for basic features like high-beam assist, dual-zone
    climate control, adaptive cruise control, and smartphone integration.

    store. From there, Audi forces you into add-ons like adaptive cruise control or
    Apple CarPlay and Android Auto for a one-month, six-month, one-year, or three-year
    subscription. Or you can just purchase any of those features permanently—although
    Audi doesn't say for how much.

    European-spec A3\. An Audi spokesperson declined to comment on whether these in-car
    subscriptions will also make it to the US when the car goes on sale for 2025.

    The already-tiny gear shifter from the previous A3 is now slimmer and blends into
    the center console, new fabric inserts with lightning elements cover the door
    panels, and the decorative cabin lighting now has 30 color options.

    A3 in Europe will come with a 1.5-liter four-cylinder mild-hybrid engine making
    148 horsepower with either a seven-speed automatic or a six-speed manual transmission.
    A 35 TDI diesel model will have the same 148 hp, and a plug-in-hybrid model will
    be available at the end of the year.

    a crossover, the five-door hatchback comes with a matte black grille, front and
    rear grooves mimicking skid plates, and plastic trim around the wheel wells. The
    Allstreet is 1.2 inches higher than the standard A3 and has a softer ride. A set
    of 17-inch wheels come standard, but 18- and 19-inch shoes are also available.

    behind the rear seats, with up to 42.4 cubes of space with the rear seats folded
    flat. An electric tailgate is available as an option.

    (around $39,000) and the sedan is an extra €800 ($875). The funky new A3 Allstreet
    costs €37,450 ( $41,000).
