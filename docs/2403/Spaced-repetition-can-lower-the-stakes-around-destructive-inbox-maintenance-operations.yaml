    but [Triage strategies for maintaining inboxes (e.g. Inbox Zero) are often too
    brittle](/z2Pg1CbUyvjV4jEoqmr8Xua). In large part that’s because [Software interfaces

    different. That browser tab isn’t gone—it’ll come back later. Maybe it’s a day
    later at first, then if I skip it again, a few days later, then maybe a week,
    and so on, until “not right now” is effectively “close”… but it doesn’t feel nearly
    so stressful. This notion can be applied to task queues, reading lists ([A reading
    inbox to capture possibly-useful references](/zDXBGEWk7msyonQ2Ngnrf8h)), email
    inboxes, etc. [Spaced repetition mechanics create a sense of effortlessness](/zM2KVgUySDFDqAZ7MoD3oZd).

    lots of papers on it. You naturally pull out the few which you’re using at the
    moment, and maybe you set a few aside for special attention. The rest sit, perhaps
    in a couple of piles. You intermittently look through the piles, pulling out ones
    which strike your fancy. The ones which sit long enough start to simply dissolve,
    compost into the table surface. You can always restore them if you like, but if
    you don’t, they’ll get tilled under.
