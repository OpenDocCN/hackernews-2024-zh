    disasters. And many are aiming to utilize new technologies designed to make meltdown
    accidents impossible and to create less long-lived waste.

    diverted to weapons programs, environmental issues posed by mining for uranium,
    the problems of storing nuclear waste. Against a backdrop of such concerns, alongside
    shifting economics of energy production, nuclear power production started to level
    off in the early 2000s and even dipped briefly after the Fukushima power plant
    accident of 2011\. Some nations, most notably Germany, decided to shutter their
    nuclear programs entirely. But global nuclear power production is now starting

    global nuclear power production doubles over 2022 levels by 2050\. A key reason

    power to prop up more variable renewable sources of energy like wind or solar.

    the burden of these last issues falls disproportionately on Indigenous anddisempowered

    take a herculean effort. The IEA’s pathway requires the world to ramp up from
    building five big nuclear plants per year to 20 per year over the next decade.
    Big plants typically cost billions of dollars and come with big financial risks.
    Westinghouse Electric Company, for example, recently filed for bankruptcy in the
    face of billions of dollars of cost overruns during the construction of four nuclear
    plants in the United States.

    megawatts, to tiny single-megawatt sizes that are more akin to hefty diesel generators.
    The modules could be pre-built in a factory and shipped to a site for installation.

    the dominant technology largely as a quirk of history. Like all reactor types,
    they have their pros and cons. They need high pressures to stop their coolant
    waters from boiling off at typical operating temperatures around 300 degrees Celsius.
    And they are designed to work with relatively slow-moving neutrons — the subatomic
    particles that collide with nuclear fuel to initiate nuclear fission. Slow-moving
    neutrons are more likely to interact with fuel particles, but systems that use
    them are also limited in the kinds of fuels they can use. Catastrophe can strike
    if the fission reaction runs amok or the reactor gets too hot and the core “melts
    down,” as happened at Three Mile Island, Chernobyl and Fukushima, spewing radiation
    into the environment.

    many SMRs) use new design tricks to reduce the number of safety systems that require
    human intervention, aiming to stop accidents in their tracks automatically. Gen
    IV reactors, though, use entirely different coolant materials, are usually designed
    to operate at higher, more efficient temperatures, and often use faster-speed
    neutrons that can convert the most prevalent natural isotopes of uranium into
    usable fuel, or even feed on nuclear waste.

    950°C, making them 20 to 33 percent more thermally efficient than water-cooled
    reactors. Since the core materials used in these reactors are typically stable
    up to 1,600°C, which is hotter than lava, there’s a large margin of safety. The
    reactor in Ultra Safe’s video is an SMR that falls into this category; its small
    size helps, too, with passive cooling. Ultra Safe also makes their own fuel pellets,
    encased in a bespoke material that they say retains radioactive materials even
    in extreme conditions. They’re hoping to build their [first commercial micro-reactor](https://globalfirstpower.com/?ref=usnc.com)

    both fuel and coolant are already liquid. So meltdowns, in the traditional sense,
    are impossible. And liquid-sodium-cooled reactors have a built-in safety feature:
    If they heat up, the liquid sodium expands and allows more neutrons to escape
    through the gaps between atoms, so the reaction (which is driven by neutrons)
    naturally winds down. The US Department of Energy has funded the US company TerraPower
    (which has Bill Gates as a major investor) to build a demonstration plant of its
    sodium-cooled Natrium reactor in Wyoming by 2030.'

    says Giovannini. “None of the reactors have entirely solved the problem of nuclear
    waste, but they do provide some significant solutions in terms of quantity,” she
    says. The spent fuel from traditional light water reactors needs to be buried
    in special repositories for hundreds of thousands of years, because of the production
    of long-lived radioactive byproducts. Some Gen IV reactors, on the other hand,
    can transform spent fuel into more fissile isotopes and use it for further fission
    reactions. This can improve efficiency and produce waste that need only be stored
    for hundreds of years.
