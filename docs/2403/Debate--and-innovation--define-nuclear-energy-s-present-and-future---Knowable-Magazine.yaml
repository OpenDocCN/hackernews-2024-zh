    metal can burst into flame when in contact with water or air. High-temperature
    gas-cooled reactors, the report concluded, while tolerant of high temperatures,
    are “far from meltdown-proof, as some claim.”

    for nuclear heat in desalination, getting clean drinking water out of saltwater
    as is done at the Diablo Canyon nuclear power plant in California. Indeed, X-energy,
    a leading US Gen IV nuclear company funded by the DOE, has partnered with Dow
    chemical company to build its first high-temperature gas-cooled reactor at a Dow
    chemical production site by 2030\. Morgan, though, thinks that most industries
    will balk at the set-up costs.

- en: Even if Gen IV reactors turn out to be technically superior, though, it may
    be decades before they can be thoroughly tested, passed by regulators and built
    at commercial scale. With little time to spare in the fight against climate change,
    the world might be better off simply ramping up old reactor designs that are already
    proven, says Esam Hussein, a retired nuclear engineer from the University of Regina,
    Canada.“We have the operating experience, we have the regulatory framework,” he
    says. “If the goal is to fight climate change, why don’t you go with the devil
    you know?”

    Hussein说：“我们有运行经验，我们有监管框架。”“如果目标是应对气候变化，为什么不选择你已知的恶魔呢？”

    no energy solution is problem-free, including renewables. Giovannini says she
    agrees with the nuclear industry’s criticism that we have “jumped on renewables
    in a very uncritical way.” Wind and solar require electronics and battery banks
    to store their energy; these in turn need elements like lithium and cobalt that
    can come with environmental and social justice issues from mining. “Nothing is
    100 percent safe,” says Vetter.

  zh: 针对为什么我们需要有所作为，许多人迅速指出没有任何能源解决方案是毫无问题的，包括可再生能源。Giovannini表示，她同意核能行业的批评，认为我们“在非常不批判的情况下跳上了可再生能源的车。”风能和太阳能需要电子设备和电池组来存储能量；这些设备又需要像锂和钴这样的元素，其开采可能伴随着环境和社会公正问题。“没有什么是百分之百安全的，”Vetter说道。

    given its history and the huge amounts of money at stake. “I think the nuclear
    industry is selling a bunch of bullshit most of the time,” says Giovannini, who
    [has been critical](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-00580-4) of how
    the industry deals with public concerns. But her own main worry about nuclear
    is “they’re moving too slow.” If companies like Ultra Safe, X-energy, TerraPower
    and others are going to help fight climate change with Gen IV technologies and
    fleets of small reactors, she and others say, they’re going to have to ramp up
    fast.

    Safe、X-energy、TerraPower等公司要借助第四代技术和大量小型反应堆来应对气候变化，她和其他人表示，它们必须加快步伐。
