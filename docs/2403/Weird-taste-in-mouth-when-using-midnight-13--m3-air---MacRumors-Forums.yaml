- en: OK, this is gonna sound crazy, but after using my 13 inch MacBook Air, M3 in
    'midnight' for 10 minutes or longer, I begin to notice a weird taste in my mouth,
    slightly grainy and metallic. I can't tell if I might be inhaling some fumes from
    it, or I am absorbing some chemicals from the finish through my hands (midnight
    w/ anodization). I have other MacBooks in the house (none in this finish or generation),
    and have never experienced this before.

    taste immediately comes back!
