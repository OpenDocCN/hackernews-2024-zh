    potential competitors to the Apple App Store. They are undermining our ability

    critic of Apple's terms, which sees the technology giant take a 30% fee on all
    payments made via the App Store. In 2020, Epic introduced the ability for Fortnite
    players to buy items directly from Epic, and offered a discount for anyone that
    did. This led to [Apple kicking the hit game off the App Store.](https://www.gamesindustry.biz/fortnite-removed-from-app-store-after-it-dodges-apples-rule-on-direct-payments)
