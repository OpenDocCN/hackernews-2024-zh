    us with an unprecedented opportunity to accelerate research within, for example,
    human and planetary health,” says Mads Krogsgaard Thomsen, CEO of the Novo Nordisk
    Foundation. “Drug discovery, disease diagnosis, and treatment, as well as complicated
    life science challenges, are examples of areas where extreme AI computing power
    can enable the positive transformation of our society. The collaboration with
    NVIDIA and the resulting national AI innovation centre can help Denmark’s brilliant
    researchers and innovators rise to the next level.”

    deliver, install, and configure the supercomputer, named Gefion, later in 2024,
    and provide support with the start-up phase. The centre – called the Danish Centre
    for AI Innovation – is expected to be ready for pilot projects before the end
    of the year. The Novo Nordisk Foundation has committed approximately DKK 600 million
    towards the initial costs of the centre. EIFO has contributed DKK 100 million.

    pursue large-scale projects in countless fields where AI is a valuable tool, as
    well as within AI research itself. In selected flagship project areas, researchers
    will be able to engage with expert teams at NVIDIA to co-develop solutions to
    complex problems. These include research in pharmaceuticals and biotechnology
    using [NVIDIA BioNeMo](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/clara/bionemo/), including
    protein design; the acceleration of the green transition; and the development
    of fault-tolerant (i.e. error-free) quantum computing using [NVIDIA CUDA Quantum](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-quantum),
    an open-source hybrid quantum computing platform.
