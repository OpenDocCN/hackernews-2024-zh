- en: Inclusive Sans is a text font designed for accessibility and readability. It
    is inspired by the friendly personality of contemporary neo-grotesques while incorporating
    key features to make it highly legible in all uses. The Regular and Italic styles
    are currently available for use on [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Inclusive+Sans).

    centred on type sizes and colour contrasts [1](https://github.com/LivKing/Inclusive-Sans#user-content-fn-1-2be6f34a11f064110d69370092ef39f9).
    However research [2](https://github.com/LivKing/Inclusive-Sans#user-content-fn-2-2be6f34a11f064110d69370092ef39f9)
    has shown that accessibility in type is crucial at a character level, where key
    features can enhance the readability of text for those who are hard of seeing
    or are neurodiverse.

    [3](https://github.com/LivKing/Inclusive-Sans#user-content-fn-3-2be6f34a11f064110d69370092ef39f9),
    working with clients across in disability non-for-profits and large government
    organisations, as well as conversations with fellow designer Johanna Roca, I was
    inspired to create a typeface that was truly legible at a character level. While
    some typefaces had been created in the same spirit [4](https://github.com/LivKing/Inclusive-Sans#user-content-fn-4-2be6f34a11f064110d69370092ef39f9),
    I wanted to create a font that was more contemporary and usable as a text typeface
    for all types of use.'

    in a 10 week type design course run by Troy Leinster, and by August that year
    had completed the majority of the full Latin set. Living and working on Gadigal
    Country (Sydney, Australia) I felt it was important to include support for Aboriginal
    and Torres Strait Islander languages. She added an additional 48 glyphs with the
    help of Vincent Chan (in consultation with Sasha Wilmouth from the University
    of Melbourne).
