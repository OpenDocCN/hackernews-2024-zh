- en: Back in February, the French National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS)
    announced some pretty dismal news. Many of our favorite cheeses, including [Camembert](https://www.salon.com/2024/02/20/camembert-and-other-french-cheese-on-verge-of-extinction-due-to-collapse-in-microbial-diversity/),
    brie and various blue cheese varieties, are on the “verge of extinction” due to
    a collapse in microbial diversity.

- en: The issue centers on one specific strain of fungi called *Penicillium camemberti*,
    which is revered as “the gold standard for brie and Camembert” because of its
    appetizing qualities. Cheese itself contains its own ecosystem of molds, yeasts
    and bacteria that work in tandem to give cheese their signature funk. However,
    in recent years, the genetic diversity of such microbes has declined immensely.
    Many signature French cheeses currently rely on just one single fragile strain
    of fungi — *Penicillium camemberti* — which is unfortunately at risk of dying
    out.

- en: Unlike most molds, *Penicillium camemberti* can’t reproduce sexually with other
    fungi to create new genetic diversity. As a result, cheesemakers have to clone
    it — but that has become increasingly difficult because of mutations that interfere
    with the fungi’s ability to produce spores. Jeanne Ropars, an evolutionary biologist
    who works at a lab affiliated with CNRS, told [Vox](https://www.vox.com/down-to-earth/2024/2/10/24065277/cheese-extinction-camembert-brie-mold)
    that the at-risk cheeses won’t disappear in an instant. Instead, they will “be
    more and more difficult to produce.”

    also suggested consumers expand their palate and get comfortable with funkier-looking
    and tasting cheeses. That essentially means Camembert and brie made with other
    mold strains.

    On X — the social platform formerly known as Twitter — brie enthusiasts mourned
    the possible extinction of their go-to stinky cheese. “Brie cheese is going extinct
    and [you're] not doing anything? Scientists in France made it asexual and now
    the bacteria that creates it cannot [reproduce] on its own and [it's] dying out
    at alarming rates and [you're] just typing in a spreadsheet at work? Appalling,”
    [said](https://twitter.com/sharkedupdown/status/1765433921200914906) one user.

    charcuterie boards and more in an attempt to enjoy brie before it officially bids
    adieu. Emmy Rener — founder of Sophisticated Spreads, a charcuterie board business
    (@sophisticatedspreads) — [posted a TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/@sophisticatedspreads/video/7338551040972688670?lang=en)
    of a charcuterie spread complete with a wheel of brie, nuts, crackers and fruit.
    “When you find that BRIE CHEESE might go extinct because the world doesn’t have
    enough bacteria to produce it,” a caption in the video read.

    recipes for brie grilled cheese. A few folks flocked to their local grocery stores
    to stock up on all the brie they could find. And some even asserted that they
    were officially giving up brie for good to savor in other cheeses, like feta and

    possible, Salon Food has got you covered. Be sure to try [Maggie Hennessy’s fresh
    tomato and buttery brie pasta](https://www.salon.com/2021/08/10/the-perfect-pasta-for-hot-summer-nights-stars-fresh-tomatoes-and-buttery-brie/):
    “Think of this dish as bruschetta in pasta form, best eaten on the desk in a shirt
    you''re not afraid of splattering with pinkish sauce.” In addition to its two
    star ingredients, the pasta calls for spaghetti, extra virgin olive oil, fresh
    basil leaves, garlic, red pepper flakes and salt. The pasta is best enjoyed alongside
    an ice-cold glass of dry rosé, per Hennessy’s recommendation.'
