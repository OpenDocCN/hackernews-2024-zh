- en: Young adults who were prescribed stimulant medications for attention-deficit/hyperactivity
    disorder (ADHD) were significantly more likely to develop cardiomyopathy (weakened
    heart muscle) compared with those who were not prescribed stimulants, in a study
    presented at the American College of Cardiology’s Annual Scientific Session.

  zh: 一项在美国心脏病学院年度科学会议上发布的研究表明，为注意力缺陷/多动障碍（ADHD）患者处方刺激药物的年轻成年人，与未处方刺激药物者相比，更有可能发展心肌病（心肌肌肉减弱）。
- en: The study found that people prescribed stimulants such as Adderall and Ritalin
    were 17% more likely to have cardiomyopathy at one year and 57% more likely to
    have cardiomyopathy at eight years compared with those who were not taking these
    medications. Cardiomyopathy involves structural changes in the heart muscle that
    weaken its pumping ability. It can cause a person to tire easily and limit their
    ability to perform daily tasks, and it often worsens over time.

  zh: 研究发现，处方如阿德拉尔和利他林等刺激药物的人，在一年内心肌病发生的可能性增加了17%，在八年内增加了57%，与不服用这些药物的人相比。心肌病涉及心肌结构的变化，使其泵血能力减弱。它会导致人很容易疲劳，限制其日常任务的能力，并且通常会随时间而恶化。
- en: However, researchers said that the overall risk of cardiomyopathy remained relatively
    low even when stimulants were used long-term. They said the findings do not necessarily
    point to a need for clinicians to change their approach to screening patients
    or prescribing stimulants.

  zh: 然而，研究人员表示，即使长期使用刺激药物，心肌病的总体风险仍然相对较低。他们说，这些发现不一定意味着临床医生需要改变他们的患者筛查方法或处方刺激药物的方法。
- en: “The longer you leave patients on these medications, the more likely they are
    to develop cardiomyopathy, but the risk of that is very low,” said Pauline Gerard,
    a second-year medical student at the University of Colorado School of Medicine
    in Aurora, Colorado, and the study’s lead author. “I don’t think this is a reason
    to stop prescribing these medications. There’s very little increased risk of these
    medications over the long term; it’s a real risk, but it’s small.”

  zh: “患者服用这些药物的时间越长，他们发生心肌病的可能性就越大，但这个风险非常低，” 科罗拉多大学医学院第二年级医学生和该研究的主要作者保琳·杰拉德说。“我认为这不是停止开具这些药物的理由。长期使用这些药物的增加风险非常小，确实存在风险，但风险很小。”
- en: ADHD is one of the most common neurodevelopmental disorders in children, affecting
    about 1 out of 10 American children aged 3 to 17, and can continue into adulthood.
    It is typically treated with behavioral therapy initially, which may be combined
    with stimulant or non-stimulant medications to help control behaviors that interfere
    with daily life and relationships. Stimulant medications can elevate blood pressure
    by causing the heart to beat faster and with greater force.

  zh: ADHD是美国3至17岁儿童中最常见的神经发育障碍之一，约每10名儿童中就有1名患病，并且可能持续到成年。通常开始采用行为疗法治疗，初期可结合刺激性或非刺激性药物来帮助控制干扰日常生活和人际关系的行为。刺激性药物通过使心脏跳动更快、更有力来升高血压。
- en: Most previous studies assessing the safety of stimulant medications have focused
    on the first year or two of use and found no evidence of harm to the heart. Since
    many patients are prescribed these medications in early childhood and continue
    taking them into adulthood, this new study was designed to assess their potential
    to cause harm over a longer period of time, Gerard said.

  zh: 大多数之前评估刺激药物安全性的研究集中在使用的第一或第二年，并未发现对心脏有害的证据。由于许多患者在幼儿期就被开具这些药物，并持续使用到成年，这项新研究旨在评估它们长期使用的潜在危害，Gerard
    说。
- en: Using the TriNetX research database that includes information from about 80
    hospitals across the U.S., researchers analyzed data from people diagnosed with
    ADHD between 20-40 years of age. Individuals with the presence or absence of a
    prescription for stimulant medications along with rates of cardiomyopathy that
    could potentially be linked to stimulant use were included. Those with heart damage
    caused by other known factors, such as cancer treatments, were excluded.

  zh: 研究使用TriNetX研究数据库，该数据库包括来自美国约80家医院的信息，分析了20-40岁之间被诊断为ADHD的人群的数据。包括具有与使用兴奋剂药物相关的心肌病潜在联系的处方存在或缺失以及其发生率。那些因其他已知因素（如癌症治疗）导致心脏损伤的人被排除在外。
- en: For the analysis, the researchers paired each person who had been prescribed
    stimulants with an individual who had not been prescribed stimulants but was as
    similar as possible in all other respects, such as age, sex and other health conditions.
    Overall, 12,759 pairs were created and were followed for at least 10 years. Of
    these pairs, people prescribed stimulants were found to be significantly more
    likely to develop cardiomyopathy throughout the 10-year follow-up period, with
    the gap growing larger each year except the last two, when it narrowed slightly.

  zh: 在分析中，研究人员将每个被开处方给予兴奋剂的人与一个在年龄、性别和其他健康状况等方面尽可能相似的未开处方给予兴奋剂的个体配对。总共创建了12,759对，并在至少10年内进行了跟踪。在这些对中，被开处方给予兴奋剂的人在10年的跟踪期间更有可能发展心肌病，而且差距每年都在扩大，除了最后两年略微缩小。
- en: Despite the significant gap, the overall prevalence of cardiomyopathy was still
    quite low in both groups. After being prescribed stimulants for 10 years, 0.72%
    (less than three-quarters of one percent) of patients developed cardiomyopathy,
    compared with 0.53% (a little over half of one percent) among those who were not
    prescribed stimulants.

  zh: 尽管差距显著，但两组中心肌病的总体患病率仍然相当低。在接受兴奋剂处方10年后，0.72%的患者（不到百分之一）发展为心肌病，而未接受兴奋剂处方的患者中为0.53%（超过半个百分点）。
- en: To put the numbers into context, Gerard said, “You can have almost 2,000 patients
    on these medications for a year and you might only cause one of them to have a
    cardiomyopathy that they otherwise would not have had, but if you leave them on
    it for 10 years, 1 in 500 will have that happen.”

  zh: 为了将这些数字放入背景中，Gerard 表示：“你可以给这些药物使用者中的近2000名患者使用一年，你可能只会导致其中一名患者因此患上他们本来不会得的心肌病，但如果让他们使用10年，500名中会有1名发生这种情况。”
- en: At these levels, researchers said the study does not suggest that aggressive
    testing for cardiovascular risk is warranted before prescribing stimulants, given
    that the potential benefits of testing must be balanced against the risks and
    costs. They suggest that further studies could help to identify subgroups of patients
    at greater risk who may benefit from future screening approaches.

  zh: 研究人员称，在这些水平上，研究并未建议在开处方给予兴奋剂之前进行激进的心血管风险测试，因为必须在测试的潜在益处与风险和成本之间取得平衡。他们建议进一步研究可能有助于识别处于更大风险中的患者亚组，这些患者可能从未来的筛查方法中受益。
