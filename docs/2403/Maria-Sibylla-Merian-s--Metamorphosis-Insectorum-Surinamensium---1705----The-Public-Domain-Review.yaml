- en: As a young girl growing up in Frankfurt, Merian would often travel to the countryside
    to search for caterpillar larvae. She raised silkworms at thirteen years old,
    and gave thorough attention to every subtle shift in the physiology of her specimens.
    When she moved to Nuremberg with her husband in 1670, she was hired to teach illustration
    to wealthy, unmarried women, thereby securing herself access to some of the finest
    gardens in Germany, elaborate oases for the insects she studied. In 1690, now
    the mother of two young daughters, Merian divorced. And by 1699, after a decade
    of supporting herself through art, she was given permission from the city of Amsterdam
    to undertake research in Suriname with her youngest daughter, Dorothea. Lacking
    the financial backing from commercial enterprise that was typical for other Dutch
    naturalists, the pair stayed fiscally afloat through the sale of roughly 255 of
    their own paintings. Rumors abound that this voyage was partially paid for by
    the director of the Dutch West India Company, but there is no acknowledgement
    of sponsorship in Merian’s writing, and she was quite open with her criticism
    of colonial merchants. To her, their myopic obsession with sugar was self-destructive,
    disappointing. There were so many other potentially world-altering plants available
    for export, and it was her job to illuminate their existence.

  zh: 小时候在法兰克福长大的玛丽亚·西比拉·梅里安经常去乡下寻找毛毛虫的幼虫。她在13岁时开始饲养蚕，并且非常关注她研究对象生理上微小的变化。1670年，她与丈夫搬到纽伦堡后，被聘请教授插画给富有的未婚女性，从而确保她可以进入德国一些最好的花园，这些花园是她研究昆虫的精致绿洲。到了1690年，现在已经是两个女儿的母亲的梅里安离婚了。到了1699年，在通过艺术自给自足的十年后，她得到了阿姆斯特丹市允许她与她最小的女儿多萝西亚一起前往苏里南进行研究。由于缺乏其他荷兰自然学家典型的商业支持，这对母女靠销售大约255幅他们自己的画作勉强维持生计。有传言称，这次航行部分由荷兰西印度公司的总裁支付，但梅里安的著作中并未提到赞助，她对殖民商人的批评也是公开的。在她看来，他们对糖的狭隘迷恋是自毁的，令人失望的。还有许多其他可能改变世界的植物可以出口，而她的工作就是揭示它们的存在。
