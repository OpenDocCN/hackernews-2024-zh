    communication difficulties. These studies highlighted how autistic people face
    issues with everyday tasks that allistic (meaning non-autistic) people do not.
    Some difficulties may include recognising emotions or social cues.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But some research, including our own study, has explored specific advantages
    in autism. Studies have shown that in some cognitive tasks, autistic people [perform
    better](https://academic.oup.com/brain/article/128/10/2430/274623?login=false)
    than allistic people. Autistic people may have greater success in identifying
    a simple shape [embedded within a more complex design](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15985068/),
    arranging blocks of [different shapes and colours](https://acamh.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1469-7610.1993.tb02095.x),
    or [spotting an object within a cluttered visual environment](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3976471/)
    (similar to Where’s Wally?). Such enhanced performance has been recorded in [babies
    as young as nine months](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982215005552)
    who show emerging signs of autism.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Generally, when you think of noise, you probably think of auditory noise, the
    ups and downs in the amplitude of sound frequencies we hear.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A similar thing happens in the brain with random fluctuations in neural activity.
    This is called neural noise.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This noise is always present, and comes on top of any brain activity caused
    by things we see, hear, smell and touch. This means that in the brain, an identical
    stimulus that is presented multiple times won’t cause exactly the same activity.
    Sometimes the brain is more active, sometimes less. In fact, even the response
    to a single stimulus or event will fluctuate continuously.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There are many [sources of neural noise](https://www.nature.com/articles/nrn2258)
    in the brain. These include how the neurons become excited and calm again, changes
    in attention and arousal levels, and biochemical processes at the cellular level,
    among others. An allistic brain has mechanisms to [manage and use this noise](https://www.nature.com/articles/nrn3061).
    For instance, cells in the hippocampus (the brain’s memory system) can make use
    of neural noise to enhance memory encoding and recall.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Evidence for high neural noise in autism can be seen in [electroencephalography
    (EEG) recordings](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2011.00051/full),
    where increased levels of neural fluctuations were observed in autistic children.
    This means their neural activity is less predictable, showing a wider range of
    activity (higher ups and downs) in response to the same stimulus.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In simple terms, if we imagine the EEG responses like a sound wave, we would
    expect to see small ups and downs (amplitude) in allistic brains each time they
    encounter a stimulus. But autistic brains seem to show bigger ups and downs, demonstrating
    greater amplitude of neural noise.

    A shift from the medical to a more social model has also seen advocacy for it
    to be reframed as a difference, rather than a disorder or deficit. This change
    has also entered autism research. Neuroaffirming research can examine the uniqueness
    and strengths of neurodivergence.

    at the University of Glasgow were the first to suggest that while high neural
    noise is generally a disadvantage in autism, it can sometimes provide benefits
    due to a phenomenon called [stochastic resonance](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1388245703003304?via%3Dihub).
    This is where optimal amounts of noise can [enhance performance](https://theconversation.com/like-to-work-with-background-noise-it-could-be-boosting-your-performance-119598).
    In line with this theory, high neural noise in the autistic brain might enhance
    performance for some cognitive tasks.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    We recruited participants from the general population and investigated their performance
    on letter-detection tasks. At the same time, we measured their level of autistic
    traits.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    where participants had to identify a letter when displayed among background visual
    static of various intensities.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: By using the static, we added additional visual noise to the neural noise already
    present in our participants’ brains. We hypothesised the visual noise would push
    participants with low internal brain noise (or low autistic traits) to perform
    better (as suggested by [previous research](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S030101041000193X)
    on stochastic resonance). The more interesting prediction was that noise would
    not help individuals who already had a lot of brain noise (that is, those with
    high autistic traits), because their own neural noise already ensured optimal
    performance.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Indeed, one of our experiments showed people with high neural noise (high autistic
    traits) did not benefit from additional noise. Moreover, they showed superior
    performance (greater accuracy) relative to people with low neural noise when the
    added visual static was low. This suggests their own neural noise already caused
    a natural stochastic resonance effect, resulting in better performance.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It is important to note we did not include clinically diagnosed autistic participants,
    but overall, we showed the theory of enhanced performance due to stochastic resonance
    in autism has merits.
