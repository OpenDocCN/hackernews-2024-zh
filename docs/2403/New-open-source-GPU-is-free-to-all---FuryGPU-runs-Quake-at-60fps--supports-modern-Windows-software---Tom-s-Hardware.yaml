- en: An open source fully custom GPU has come out of stealth after four years in
    development. [FuryGPU](https://www.furygpu.com/) has been a one-man effort from
    games software developer Dylan Barrie, who says he put together this extremely
    complex hardware and software project in his spare time. FuryGPU is based on a
    Xilinx FPGA design, and the prototype PCIe graphics card is currently capable
    of achieving around 44fps in the Quake Timedemo. The work on FuryGPU was undertaken
    after Barrie was inspired by [Ben Eater’s](https://eater.net/8bit) building a
    programmable 8-bit computer from scratch project.

    a typical PC graphics card from about 20 years ago, modernized by equipping [DisplayPort
    and HDMI](https://www.tomshardware.com/features/displayport-vs-hdmi-better-for-gaming)
    outputs. The project is far more than the hardware, though, with Barrie admitting
    that the most painful aspect of this graphics card’s design was creating the Windows
    drivers.

- en: Barrie began realizing his dreams of building a GPU from scratch after picking
    up an FPGA-packing Arty Z7 development board and doing some preliminary development
    and testing. Subsequently, the project got a boost by the debut of [Xilinx](https://www.tomshardware.com/news/amd-xilinx-acqusition-completed)
    Kria System-on-Modules (SoMs), which combine “insanely cheap [Zynq UltraScale+](https://www.xilinx.com/products/silicon-devices/soc/zynq-ultrascale-mpsoc.html)
    FPGAs with a ton of DSP units and a (comparatively) massive amount of LUTs and
    FFs, and of particular interest, a hardened PCIe core,” enthused Barrie.

- en: To go from this maker board to the FuryGPU PCIe add-in-card design we see in
    2024, Barrie taught himself the SystemVerilog hardware description and hardware
    verification language and the KiCAD EDA / electronics CAD software suite. He says
    a Herculean effort was required to design the schematic for the FuryGPU with the
    4-lane PCIe we see today, even with the FPGA circuitry built into the SoM. Now
    it was time to plug the FuryGPU into his test rig, write the drivers, and test
    games.

    painful” aspect of the entire project – despite his day job being in the software
    side of graphics rendering in the games development industry for the last 14 years.

    cube demo, to show the GPU working. However, as the project developed, playing
    the iconic PC game Quake at playable frame rates started to become the new goal.

    graphics API to communicate with the GPU, wrote Windows kernel drivers for the
    display and audio, and now has “a fully-functional piece of graphics hardware
    that can render Quake at a solid 60 frames per second.”

- en: We’ve embedded Barrie’s Quake Timedemo video capture, demonstrating that the
    FuryGPU could achieve 44fps in this benchmark at 720p about a month ago. The developer
    says there are clear opportunities to get Quake “running much faster,” as he saw
    some obvious bottlenecks that he will target for optimization efforts.

- en: The FuryGPU is set to be open-sourced. “I am intending on open-sourcing the
    entire stack (PCB schematic/layout, all the HDL, Windows WDDM drivers, API runtime
    drivers, and Quake ported to use the API) at some point, but there are a number
    of legal issues,” Barrie wrote in a [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39836745)
    post on Wednesday. Because he works in a tangentially related vocation, he wants
    to make sure none of this work would break his work contract or licensing etc.
    This same thread includes quite a bit of extra detail about the FuryGPU project
    for those particularly interested.

- en: To conclude our coverage of this interesting new (to us) project, it is worth
    explaining the intended scope of the FuryGPU project. It is clear this is a maker
    project, like the breadboard CPU, but the FuryGPU offers such impressive performance
    that some may mistake it for a serious new [GPU architecture](https://www.tomshardware.com/news/amd-rdna-3-gpu-architecture-deep-dive-the-ryzen-moment-for-gpus).
    Barrie makes it clear this is not the case in the afore-linked Hacker News thread
    (writing under the nom de plume of PfhorSlayer). “This is a toy,” asserted the
    FuryGPU maker. "This is not going to change the GPU landscape or compete with
    any of the commercial players.”

    graphics cards](https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/best-gpus,4380.html), we
    will watch FuryGPU developments with great interest. Now that the project has
    gone public, there’s a chance that publicity and expert collaborators can accelerate
    the plans already in place.
