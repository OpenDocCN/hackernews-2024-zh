    and beginnings out of its mind.’ With apologies to Nietzsche, the ‘questions of
    origins and beginnings’ are in fact more controversial and hotly debated. The
    ongoing Israel-Gaza war has reopened old debates over the circumstances of Israel’s
    founding and the origins of the Palestinian refugee crisis. Meanwhile, in a speech
    he gave on the eve of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Vladimir
    Putin insisted that ‘since time immemorial’ Russia had always included Ukraine,
    a situation that was disrupted by the establishment of the Soviet Union. And in
    the US, *The New York Times*’ 1619 Project generated no small amount of controversy
    by insisting that the United States’ real origins lay not with its formal constitution
    but with the introduction of slavery into North America.'

    us to the beginnings of things, of producing and being waged in part through strong
    claims about origins. Yet doing so rarely helps resolve them. Because these debates
    have become ubiquitous, we may not realise how unusual our preoccupation with
    political origins really is. Beginnings are, after all, far removed from the issues
    at hand as to be a source of leverage in ongoing controversies or a source of
    controversy themselves. Why should the distant past matter more than the recent
    past or the present? To better understand why we remain bedevilled by the problem
    of origins, and perhaps to think more clearly about them in the first place, it
    may help to turn to a familiar but unexpected source: Machiavelli.'

    – it was he who wrote ‘it is better to be feared than loved’ – but he was also
    preoccupied with the role of violence in establishing (and re-establishing) political
    societies. Few thinkers have dealt so thoroughly and so troublingly with the theme
    of political origins as Machiavelli, leading the French philosopher Louis Althusser
    to [call](https://www.versobooks.com/en-gb/products/1667-machiavelli-and-us) Machiavelli
    the ‘theorist of beginnings’. For Machiavelli, origins are chiefly of interest
    for two reasons: first, they reveal essential truths about the impermanence of
    political life that are otherwise obscured by ordinary politics; and, second,
    their violent conditions are in principle replicable always and everywhere.'

    outside of our liberal tradition. Every society in history has had its origin
    stories, but the question of beginnings poses particular challenges for those
    of us living in the kinds of modern states that first began to take shape in the
    17th century. For their legitimacy rests upon their deliberative and representative
    character. Nearly all existing states – even non-democratic ones – have some claim
    to represent a given people. Representative government is one of the ways that
    we assure ourselves that political power isn’t mere domination, and its rules
    and processes are intended to preserve the rights of the people who establish
    them. Consequently, we locate the origins of political society with that moment
    of establishment. The great liberal philosopher John Locke, for example, insists
    in the *Second Treatise of Government* (1689) that ‘the beginning of politic society
    depends upon the consent of the individuals, to join into, and make one society;
    who, when they are thus incorporated, might set up what form of government they
    thought fit.’

    in the first place? And if some do claim to establish a new political order, who
    gets to decide which individuals are included among ‘the people’ and which are

    And how did it happen in the first place?

    in *A Theory of Justice* (1971), perhaps the most influential work of political
    theory in the past 50 years, admits that his considerations of justice simply
    assume the existence of a stable and self-contained national community. Earlier,
    Thomas Hobbes and, later, Immanuel Kant had faced this question more squarely,
    but both warned against enquiring about the origins of our societies at all, for,
    as Hobbes wrote in 1651, ‘there is scarce a commonwealth in the world, whose beginnings
    can in conscience be justified.’

    – the *Discourses on Livy*, his magisterial treatment of the ancient Roman republic,
    and his *Florentine Histories* – open with discussions of the sources of populations
    themselves. Such questions concerning the origins of populations remain pressing
    even today, as indicated by the trendiness of the concept of ‘indigeneity’ – that
    is, the attempt to identify an authentically original people with a title to the
    land that precedes all others – which has been applied to places as disparate
    as Canada, Palestine, Finland and Taiwan. One sees a similar impulse behind certain
    Right-wing nationalist claims, like Jean-Marie Le Pen’s insistence that the true
    French nation traces back to the 5th-century coronation of Clovis I. We want an
    unambiguous point of origin to which a legitimate claim to territory might be
    fixed. Machiavelli, however, denies us such a stable point.

- en: At the outset of the *Discourses*, Machiavelli claims that all cities are built
    by either natives or foreigners, but then proceeds to give examples – such as
    Rome, Athens and Venice – consisting solely of peoples who were either dispersed
    or compelled to flee from their ancestral place into a new one by an invading
    force – that is to say, by foreigners. In many cases, the invaders who sent the
    natives fleeing were themselves fleeing conditions of war. Migrations, forced
    or voluntary, are very difficult to prevent. It is not the case, for example,
    that a general improvement of living conditions might ensure demographic stability.
    Desperation is only one cause of migrations. In the case of the Franks and Germans,
    not desperation but prosperity, leading to overpopulation, compelled men to find
    new lands to inhabit. Such was the origin of the populations that destroyed the
    Roman Empire, according to Machiavelli, reproducing the cycle that initially produced
    Rome in the first place by invading Italy and establishing the kingdoms of the
    early medieval period.

    possibility of an ‘original’ people is ruled out or they are too archaic to speak
    of), and further that it may be assumed that their situation is but the end result
    of some prior (and possibly forgotten) conquest.

- en: With this discussion of the foundation of Rome, Machiavelli illustrates the
    artificiality of ‘legitimate’ origins. He first claims that Rome had both a native
    founder in Romulus and a foreign founder in his ancestor, Aeneas, who settled
    in Latium after escaping the destruction of Troy. But this immediately undercuts
    any ancestral claim Romulus might have to the territory, insofar as it derives
    from the Trojan Aeneas’ conquest of the Latins (chronicled in Virgil’s *Aeneid*).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Moreover, Romulus is compelled to replicate the actions of his ancestor – for,
    as Machiavelli sees it, the founding of a new society is always a violent affair,
    entailing a crime of some great magnitude. Romulus provides the paradigmatic example
    with the killing of his brother Remus and his ally Titus Tatius. Of these terrible
    acts, Machiavelli makes the striking remark that ‘while the deed accuses him,
    the effect excuses him’. That is to say, the extraordinary act of founding a new
    city (and ultimately an empire) absolves – and, for that matter, requires – the
    crimes committed in the process. Romulus is just one among a number of quasi-mythical
    founders whom Machiavelli exalts as the most ‘excellent’ examples in *The Prince*,
    along with Theseus, Cyrus, and Moses. All secured the establishment of their new
    societies through violence. Even for Moses, the most consequential act is not
    the flight from Egypt or receiving the Commandments at Sinai but the slaughter
    of 3,000 Israelites (a number Machiavelli raises to ‘infinite men’) for the sin
    of worshipping a golden calf.

    useful model. This move, however, pulls the whole discussion sideways: first,
    Hiero did not found anything – the city of Syracuse already existed when he came
    to power; and second, though Machiavelli will not tell us this here, Hiero is
    more commonly known as a tyrant, which is to say someone who acquires monarchical
    power rather than inheriting it. Machiavelli’s description of how Hiero acquired
    power is amusing and brief: ‘Hiero eliminated the old military and organised a
    new one; he left his old friendships and made new ones. And when he had friendships
    and soldiers that were his, he could build any building on top of such a foundation.
    So, he made a great deal of effort to acquire power, but little to maintain it.’'

    – employing mercenaries to seize control of Syracuse and then brutally cutting

    beneficiaries of some prior terrible actions on the part of a conquering ancestor
    who initially took the throne. To us they may not be soaked in blood but, go back
    far enough, and you will find a Romulus – or a Hiero.'

    to hold provinces with similar customs that he has already controlled for a long
    time. But by way of example, he offers France’s rule over Burgundy, Brittany,
    Gascony and Normandy; of these, the first two had been conquered only within Machiavelli’s
    own lifetime, and the third in 1453, less than two decades before Machiavelli’s
    birth. The ease with which the French crown held these possessions – as well as
    the fact that these regions are now simply thought of as French – is due not to
    their lasting ties but to the success with which they were initially pacified.
