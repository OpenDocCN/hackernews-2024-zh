    and beginnings out of its mind.’ With apologies to Nietzsche, the ‘questions of
    origins and beginnings’ are in fact more controversial and hotly debated. The
    ongoing Israel-Gaza war has reopened old debates over the circumstances of Israel’s
    founding and the origins of the Palestinian refugee crisis. Meanwhile, in a speech
    he gave on the eve of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Vladimir
    Putin insisted that ‘since time immemorial’ Russia had always included Ukraine,
    a situation that was disrupted by the establishment of the Soviet Union. And in
    the US, *The New York Times*’ 1619 Project generated no small amount of controversy
    by insisting that the United States’ real origins lay not with its formal constitution
    but with the introduction of slavery into North America.'

    us to the beginnings of things, of producing and being waged in part through strong
    claims about origins. Yet doing so rarely helps resolve them. Because these debates
    have become ubiquitous, we may not realise how unusual our preoccupation with
    political origins really is. Beginnings are, after all, far removed from the issues
    at hand as to be a source of leverage in ongoing controversies or a source of
    controversy themselves. Why should the distant past matter more than the recent
    past or the present? To better understand why we remain bedevilled by the problem
    of origins, and perhaps to think more clearly about them in the first place, it
    may help to turn to a familiar but unexpected source: Machiavelli.'

    – it was he who wrote ‘it is better to be feared than loved’ – but he was also
    preoccupied with the role of violence in establishing (and re-establishing) political
    societies. Few thinkers have dealt so thoroughly and so troublingly with the theme
    of political origins as Machiavelli, leading the French philosopher Louis Althusser
    to [call](https://www.versobooks.com/en-gb/products/1667-machiavelli-and-us) Machiavelli
    the ‘theorist of beginnings’. For Machiavelli, origins are chiefly of interest
    for two reasons: first, they reveal essential truths about the impermanence of
    political life that are otherwise obscured by ordinary politics; and, second,
    their violent conditions are in principle replicable always and everywhere.'

    outside of our liberal tradition. Every society in history has had its origin
    stories, but the question of beginnings poses particular challenges for those
    of us living in the kinds of modern states that first began to take shape in the
    17th century. For their legitimacy rests upon their deliberative and representative
    character. Nearly all existing states – even non-democratic ones – have some claim
    to represent a given people. Representative government is one of the ways that
    we assure ourselves that political power isn’t mere domination, and its rules
    and processes are intended to preserve the rights of the people who establish
    them. Consequently, we locate the origins of political society with that moment
    of establishment. The great liberal philosopher John Locke, for example, insists
    in the *Second Treatise of Government* (1689) that ‘the beginning of politic society
    depends upon the consent of the individuals, to join into, and make one society;
    who, when they are thus incorporated, might set up what form of government they
    thought fit.’

    Locke）在《政府论》第二篇（1689年）中坚持认为，“政治社会的开始取决于个体的同意，加入并组成一个社会；当他们被这样合并时，他们可以建立他们认为合适的政府形式。”

    in *A Theory of Justice* (1971), perhaps the most influential work of political
    theory in the past 50 years, admits that his considerations of justice simply
    assume the existence of a stable and self-contained national community. Earlier,
    Thomas Hobbes and, later, Immanuel Kant had faced this question more squarely,
    but both warned against enquiring about the origins of our societies at all, for,

    – the *Discourses on Livy*, his magisterial treatment of the ancient Roman republic,
    and his *Florentine Histories* – open with discussions of the sources of populations
    themselves. Such questions concerning the origins of populations remain pressing
    even today, as indicated by the trendiness of the concept of ‘indigeneity’ – that
    is, the attempt to identify an authentically original people with a title to the
    land that precedes all others – which has been applied to places as disparate
    as Canada, Palestine, Finland and Taiwan. One sees a similar impulse behind certain
    Right-wing nationalist claims, like Jean-Marie Le Pen’s insistence that the true
    French nation traces back to the 5th-century coronation of Clovis I. We want an
    unambiguous point of origin to which a legitimate claim to territory might be

    Rome, Athens and Venice – consisting solely of peoples who were either dispersed
    or compelled to flee from their ancestral place into a new one by an invading

    that a general improvement of living conditions might ensure demographic stability.
    Desperation is only one cause of migrations. In the case of the Franks and Germans,
    not desperation but prosperity, leading to overpopulation, compelled men to find
    new lands to inhabit. Such was the origin of the populations that destroyed the
    Roman Empire, according to Machiavelli, reproducing the cycle that initially produced
    Rome in the first place by invading Italy and establishing the kingdoms of the

    artificiality of ‘legitimate’ origins. He first claims that Rome had both a native
    founder in Romulus and a foreign founder in his ancestor, Aeneas, who settled
    in Latium after escaping the destruction of Troy. But this immediately undercuts
    any ancestral claim Romulus might have to the territory, insofar as it derives

- en: Moreover, Romulus is compelled to replicate the actions of his ancestor – for,
    as Machiavelli sees it, the founding of a new society is always a violent affair,
    entailing a crime of some great magnitude. Romulus provides the paradigmatic example
    with the killing of his brother Remus and his ally Titus Tatius. Of these terrible
    acts, Machiavelli makes the striking remark that ‘while the deed accuses him,
    the effect excuses him’. That is to say, the extraordinary act of founding a new
    city (and ultimately an empire) absolves – and, for that matter, requires – the
    crimes committed in the process. Romulus is just one among a number of quasi-mythical
    founders whom Machiavelli exalts as the most ‘excellent’ examples in *The Prince*,
    along with Theseus, Cyrus, and Moses. All secured the establishment of their new
    societies through violence. Even for Moses, the most consequential act is not
    the flight from Egypt or receiving the Commandments at Sinai but the slaughter
    of 3,000 Israelites (a number Machiavelli raises to ‘infinite men’) for the sin

    —— 事实上，也需要 —— 在此过程中犯下的罪行。罗慕路斯只是马基雅维利在《君主论》中最‘卓越’的例子之一，与忒修斯、居鲁士和摩西一同被赞颂为最‘卓越’的创立新社会者。所有这些人都通过暴力确立了他们新社会的地位。甚至对于摩西来说，最重要的行动不是逃离埃及或在西奈山接受诫命，而是屠杀了3,000名以色列人（马基雅维利将这个数字提高到‘无数人’），因为他们崇拜了一只黄金牛。

    more commonly known as a tyrant, which is to say someone who acquires monarchical
    power rather than inheriting it. Machiavelli’s description of how Hiero acquired
    power is amusing and brief: ‘Hiero eliminated the old military and organised a

    and soldiers that were his, he could build any building on top of such a foundation.

    – employing mercenaries to seize control of Syracuse and then brutally cutting

  zh: 虽然马基雅维利的作品容易被看作愤世嫉俗，但适当的愤世嫉俗实际上是现实主义。对政治生活的现实态度可以使我们免于道貌岸然和绝望，让我们能够诚实地承认那些为我们自己政治社会形成做出贡献的罪行，而不需要我们成为对自己国家不满的人。

- en: Similarly, it would be easy enough to read Machiavelli as debunking the edifying
    tales that surround the foundation of new societies, from the myths of ancient
    Greece to modern Independence Day celebrations. ‘This is what really happened,’
    he seems to say. But it is important to recognise that his account of political
    origins is not intended to be incriminating but instructive.

  zh: 同样，读马基雅维利的作品很容易把我们从古希腊神话到现代独立日庆祝活动中关于新社会成立的宣传故事中解放出来。他似乎在说：“这才是真正发生的事情。”但重要的是要认识到，他对政治起源的描述并非旨在指责，而是旨在教导。
- en: 'For his work also bears a warning: the lawless and uncertain conditions surrounding
    our origins reflect enduring possibilities in political life. These are crucial
    moments in which our existing laws are revealed to be inadequate, because they
    were formulated under different circumstances than those we may presently face,
    thus requiring daring acts of restoration undertaken in the same spirit in which
    the laws were originally established.'

  zh: 因为他的作品也带有警示：围绕我们起源的无法无天和不确定条件反映了政治生活中的持久可能性。这些是关键时刻，我们现有的法律被证明不足，因为它们是在不同情况下制定的，不同于我们现在可能面对的情况，因此需要在原法律制定的精神中进行大胆的恢复行动。
- en: 'We may not be obliged to follow directly in the footsteps of such tyrannical
    figures as Cleomenes of Sparta or the Medici of medieval Florence, all of whom
    employed terrible violence in the acts of restoration. But we may learn from such
    examples of the dramatic stakes involved in maintaining our political order –
    as the philosopher Claude Lefort put it in his magisterial 2012 [work](https://nupress.northwestern.edu/9780810124370/machiavelli-in-the-making/)

    the past, but, in the present, a response analogous to the one given in the past.’'

  zh: 我们可能不必直接效仿斯巴达的克利奥米尼斯或中世纪佛罗伦萨的美第奇那样的暴君，他们在恢复行动中采用了可怕的暴力。但我们可以从这些例子中学习，在维护我们的政治秩序中涉及的戏剧性风险——正如哲学家克劳德·勒福特在其2012年的权威
    [作品](https://nupress.northwestern.edu/9780810124370/machiavelli-in-the-making/)
    关于马基雅维利的观点所说：“这就是回归到起源的真理；不是回到过去，而是在现在，给予过去所给出的类似的回应。”
- en: 'This is part of the value we gain from reading Machiavelli: facing the troubling
    implications of our own origins may help us better prepare ourselves for the continued
    vicissitudes of political life. After all, it may be that our own established
    order is the only thing standing in the way of someone else’s new origins.'

  zh: 从阅读马基雅维利中我们获得的价值之一是：面对我们自己起源的困扰含义，可能有助于我们更好地为政治生活中持续的变数做好准备。毕竟，也许我们自己现有的秩序是唯一阻碍别人新起源的东西。
