    rotation and swap in the occasional bowl of [cereal](https://www.salon.com/2022/11/07/revisiting-millsberry-the-wild-rise-and-fall-of-general-mills-virtual-cereal-themed-town/).

    it) we’ve got something you’ll want to try,” the [description for one of the advertisements](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8Dw1bjRxY0)
    read. “Turn off the [stove](https://www.salon.com/2024/02/18/the-best-thing-you-can-do-for-your-cooking-is-leave-your-alone/),
    pop open the pantry and pour your favorite Kellogg’s cereal for dinner!”

    also suggested customers eat cereal for dinner, likely because instead of positioning

    也建议顾客晚餐吃谷类食品，可能是因为他并非像广告中那样将其定位为一点小吃，而是提出作为对食品通货膨胀感到压制的家庭的解决方案。
- en: “The cereal category has always been quite affordable, and it tends to be a
    great destination when consumers are under pressure,” Pilnick said in an interview
    with [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/video/2024/02/21/wk-kellogg-ceo-gary-pilnick-cereal-for-dinner-is-trending-for-consumers-under-price-pressure.html).

    采访时表示。“如果你考虑一家人吃谷类食品的成本，与其他可能的选择相比，这要便宜得多。”
- en: He isn’t wrong; the average price per box of cereal in the U.S. is around $3.27
    and, when speaking with CNBC, Pilnick estimated that a serving with milk in fruit
    would cost about $1\. However, his comments didn’t sit well with many viewers
    and consumer advocates who quickly pointed out that the price per unit of [Kellogg’s
    products was up by 17.1% in October](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/kellogg-cereal-dinner-controversy-price-182100461.html)
    compared with the same month a year earlier, the highest increase among ready-to-eat

  zh: 他说得没错；在美国，谷类食品每盒的平均价格约为 $3.27，当与 CNBC 谈话时，Pilnick 估计加上牛奶和水果的一餐约需花费约 $1。然而，他的评论并未得到许多观众和消费者倡导者的认同，后者迅速指出，与去年同月相比，[Kellogg's
    产品的单位价格在十月份上涨了 17.1%](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/kellogg-cereal-dinner-controversy-price-182100461.html)，这是即食谷类食品品牌中涨幅最高的。
- en: This has led to widespread calls for a boycott of Kellogg’s products, which
    could potentially spark the boycott of other food companies that are perceived
    to be similarly squeezing their customers during a period of time when, as [reported
    by Pew](https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2024/01/25/americans-more-upbeat-on-the-economy-bidens-job-rating-remains-very-low/),

    there are a lot of complex, interlocking reasons why the cost of food at the supermarket
    is still up. “Prices remain elevated due to a mixture of labor shortages tied
    to the pandemic, ongoing supply chain disruptions, droughts, avian flu and other
    factors far beyond the [Biden] administration’s control,” they wrote.
