- en: Since 2022, Kellogg has been running an ad campaign encouraging families, with
    the help of Tony the Tiger and Toucan Sam, to break out of their boring dinner
    rotation and swap in the occasional bowl of [cereal](https://www.salon.com/2022/11/07/revisiting-millsberry-the-wild-rise-and-fall-of-general-mills-virtual-cereal-themed-town/).
    “If you’re tired of cooking chicken over and over (and the kids are bored of eating
    it) we’ve got something you’ll want to try,” the [description for one of the advertisements](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8Dw1bjRxY0)
    read. “Turn off the [stove](https://www.salon.com/2024/02/18/the-best-thing-you-can-do-for-your-cooking-is-leave-your-alone/),
    pop open the pantry and pour your favorite Kellogg’s cereal for dinner!”

    nearly two years later, on Feb. 21 — [WK Kellogg Co. CEO Gary Pilnick](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/feb/27/kelloggs-ceo-cereal-for-dinner)
    also suggested customers eat cereal for dinner, likely because instead of positioning
    it, as the advertisement had, as a little treat, he suggested it as a solution
    for families feeling throttled by food inflation.

    great destination when consumers are under pressure,” Pilnick said in an interview
    with [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/video/2024/02/21/wk-kellogg-ceo-gary-pilnick-cereal-for-dinner-is-trending-for-consumers-under-price-pressure.html).

    do, that’s going to be much more affordable.”

    and, when speaking with CNBC, Pilnick estimated that a serving with milk in fruit
    would cost about $1\. However, his comments didn’t sit well with many viewers
    and consumer advocates who quickly pointed out that the price per unit of [Kellogg’s
    products was up by 17.1% in October](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/kellogg-cereal-dinner-controversy-price-182100461.html)
    compared with the same month a year earlier, the highest increase among ready-to-eat
    cereal brands.

    could potentially spark the boycott of other food companies that are perceived
    to be similarly squeezing their customers during a period of time when, as [reported
    by Pew](https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2024/01/25/americans-more-upbeat-on-the-economy-bidens-job-rating-remains-very-low/),
    more than 90% of Americans say they are “very” or “somewhat” concerned about the
    price of food — especially because the boycott is reportedly already starting
    to produce some results.

    comes down, has caused frustration for a lot of American customers. As Abha Bhattarai
    and Jeff Stein wrote for the [Washington Post,](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/02/02/grocery-price-inflation-biden/)
    there are a lot of complex, interlocking reasons why the cost of food at the supermarket
    is still up. “Prices remain elevated due to a mixture of labor shortages tied
    to the pandemic, ongoing supply chain disruptions, droughts, avian flu and other
    factors far beyond the [Biden] administration’s control,” they wrote.

    about how “[greedflation](https://fortune.com/europe/2023/12/08/greedflation-study/)”

    few years among progressive economists and lawmakers but was waved away by more
    mainstream types as a ‘conspiracy theory,’” wrote [Emily Peck for Axios](https://www.axios.com/2023/05/18/once-a-fringe-theory-greedflation-gets-its-due)
    last summer. “That changed earlier this year. In a speech in January, then-Fed
    vice chair Lael Brainard said wages weren't the main driver of inflation and pointed
    to a ‘price-price spiral,’ where companies mark up prices far higher than the
    increases in their input costs.”

    calls for the boycott of the brand are already starting to have some effect. As
    reported on Friday by the [Daily Dot](https://www.dailydot.com/news/kelloggs-cereal-99-cent-sale/),
    some shoppers have already started to see Kellogg’s cereals for prices as low
    as 99 cents on supermarket shelves. In a viral TikTok video, user Marc Fazon found
    similar prices at his store.
