    a “unique numerical, vector representation” of your palm that it recognizes when

    the “near-infrared imagery” from an Amazon One device. You’ll need to add a payment
    method to the app and upload a photo of your ID if you plan to use the service
    for age verification. You can also link loyalty programs, season passes, and gym
    memberships.

    adding that you can’t save or download the palm images to your phone. That still
