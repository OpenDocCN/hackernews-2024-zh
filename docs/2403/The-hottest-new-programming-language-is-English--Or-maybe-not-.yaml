    and almost 4 million people viewed it. It’s not hard to see why. Programming in
    English, as opposed to languages like Python, C++, Fortran or Lisp, has long been
    a dream. The [most exciting article I ever read in](https://www.technologyreview.com/2007/01/01/227178/anything-you-can-do-i-can-do-meta/)
    *[Technology Review](https://www.technologyreview.com/2007/01/01/227178/anything-you-can-do-i-can-do-meta/),*
    was about pointed towards that prospect. At the time Charles Simonyi, an early
    Microsoft employee who lead the Microsoft Word project was building a startup
    company, founded in 2002, called Intentional Software, the goal of which was to
    let developers specify what they wanted as abstractly as possible, without having
    to write pesky computer code. The point was that “The customer wouldn’t feel straitjacketed
    by a programming language. Everyone would be happy.” As far I know, though, they
    didn’t entirely succeed; in 2017 [Simonyi sold the company back to Microsoft](https://www.zdnet.com/home-and-office/work-life/microsoft-buys-intentional-software-simonyi-to-rejoin-microsoft/),
    and returned there. The product was never widely released, to my knowledge.'

    be grand. No weird punctuation to learn, no idiosyncrasies of specific programming
    languages, no bothering to memorize how a given language worked. You could think
    in your native language, without having to translate into the rigid structures
    of machines.

    just for fun). The thing about computers had, until now, always been that they
    do *exactly* what you tell them to do. If a program I wrote didn’t work, it was
    because I made a mistake. If I tracked down the mistake, and fixed it, I could
    be confident that the system would work properly. It was a kind of glorious social
    contract; I do my part, and the system does its part. My trust in the coding infrastructure
    was essentially absolute.

    They allow programs to specify with precision what they want. As Phil Libin pointed
    out in a message to me this morning, discussing a draft of this essay, “The reason
    that software engineering is done in formal languages is not because formal languages
    make it harder to specify what you want than English. Obviously. It’s because
    formal languages make it much, much easier to specify what you want.”
