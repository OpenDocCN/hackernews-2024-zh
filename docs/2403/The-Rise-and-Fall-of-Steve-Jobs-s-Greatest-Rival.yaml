    vision of the future it foretold. He was in California, working as a chemical
    engineer for Shell until he grew bored with his occupation and became active in
    the world of computing. He’d always been a good writer, and his 1972 book *The
    Value of Power*—a title commissioned by a large computer manufacturer—was one
    of the earliest books on mainframe computing that was written for business people,
    not engineers. This was the start of a reasonably lucrative career as a consultant
    and technology journalist.

    guide to using it, so he quickly wrote his next book—*Introduction to Microcomputers*.
    Traditional publishers didn’t believe there was a market for Osborne’s book and
    hesitated to publish it. But his reckless energy wouldn’t allow him to wait. He
    decided to start his own publishing company. By March 1976, the book had sold

    behind. “From the Fountainhead”was the perfect way to stay current, which, in
    turn, drove his company’s book sales. By 1979, Osborne was the foremost publisher
    of personal computing books in the world and a well-known figure in Silicon Valley.

    one of the oldest and most traditional publishers in America.

    years after he had sold. The truth was that Osborne felt like he’d conquered computer
    publishing and was losing momentum. He wanted—no, *needed*—to get that momentum

- en: From the day Adam Osborne started boarding school in England, he had been restless.
    His sister recalled that his interests seemed to constantly shift. A fascination
    with poetry gave way to science. Science gave way to engineering. Adam wanted
    to understand and master it all. That constant drive forward, his *obsession*
    with momentum would lead him to abandon a promising career with Shell for the
    unknown promise of  computing and Silicon Valley. It created unprecedented growth
    that pushed Osborne Computers to the top of its industry in less than 18 months.
    But it also meant that Osborne never stopped to address any of the logistical
    or financial risks that growth brought with it, until it was too late.

- en: In 1984, as part of his attempt to clear his name, Osborne published copies
    of sale-and-return sheets, balance statements, and a wide range of other internal
    papers from Osborne Computers. To him (and to later commentators), these clearly
    demonstrated that overall sales continued to climb, well beyond the point at which
    the media said they had stopped. This is true, but it is the *returns* part of
    them that tells the real story.

- en: For the majority of its production life, the Osborne 1 experienced a unit failure
    rate somewhere between 10–15 percent, roughly five times the industry average.
    This was in no small part due to Tom Davidson’s inexperience managing computer
    production. Perhaps if the Osborne 1 had been a more traditional computer, Davidson’s
    inexperience wouldn’t have been a problem. But its compactness was genuinely revolutionary,
    and alongside quality assurance failures that a more experienced industry hand
    would have avoided were fresh issues that arose because the design was cutting-edge.
    For example, the monitor was so close to the disk drives that it created radio
    signals that would disrupt the way the drives read data. The solution was to add
    some shielding around the monitor, but it was only implemented in 1982\. Until
    then, hundreds—if not thousands—of Osborne 1s were returned for new disk drives,
    as it was assumed there was a failure in manufacturing.

    issues, such as a glut of returns that would need to be fixed (often for free,
    at Osborne’s insistence). It would also lead dealers to hold off on placing orders
