- en: “Folding” in our community refers to running simulations of proteins, the molecular
    machines that perform most of the active processes we associate with life, from
    muscle contraction to sensing light and digesting food. We exploit the biological
    insight these simulations provide to inform drug discovery and other efforts to
    combat global health threats.
