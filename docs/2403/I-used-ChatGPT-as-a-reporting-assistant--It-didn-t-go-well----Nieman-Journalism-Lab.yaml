- en: When it comes to developments in artificial intelligence, things are moving
    fast. It’s been less than two years since the public release of AI tools like
    ChatGPT, Midjourney, Stable Diffusion and Meta’s LLaMA. Regulators, lawmakers,
    and businesses are all beginning to wrap their heads around the implications of
    the use of generative AI tools.

- en: The example story I used for this exercise was the [train derailment](https://www.ntsb.gov/investigations/Pages/RRD23MR005.aspx)
    in East Palestine, Ohio in February 2023, a major story that involved various
    kinds of data that I could ask ChatGPT to help analyze. To be clear, this wasn’t
    a story I had reported on, but I wanted to try using ChatGPT in a way that a data
    journalist might when covering it. I spent a *lot* of time chatting with ChatGPT
    as part of this exercise and, frankly, sometimes it was exhausting. You can read
    one of my chat sessions [here](https://chat.openai.com/share/c343795f-210f-4052-a506-7c662c6c78e5).
    The confidence that ChatGPT exudes when providing poorly sourced information (like
    Wikipedia) or imprecise locations can be misleading. At times I was able to get
    the chat agent to give me what I wanted, but I had to be very specific and I often
    had to scold it.

- en: For example, when ChatGPT fulfilled my request to “generate a simple map centered
    on the location of the crash,” I immediately noticed that the pin on the map was
    far from any train tracks. When I asked where it got the coordinates for the crash
    location, it replied that these were “inferred based on general knowledge of the
    event’s location.” When I pressed it for a more specific citation, it could not
    provide one, and kept repeating that it was relying on “general knowledge.” I
    had to remind the tool that I had told it at the start of the chat that “it is
    crucial that you cite your sources, and always use the most authoritative sources.”
    Before it was finally able to mark the correct location, I had to remind it that
    it could obtain location coordinates from an authoritative document I had uploaded
    earlier in the chat, a PDF of the Federal Railroad Administration [incident report](https://safetydata.fra.dot.gov/Officeofsafety/Publicsite/FORM54/F54Report.aspx?RepType=SQL&txtf54key=NS15220720230203).

- en: Extracting information and summarizing long documents is often cited as among
    the biggest strengths of tools like ChatGPT. My results were mixed. After some
    back and forth, I coaxed the agent into extracting the details and quantities
    of the hazardous chemicals that were released in the accident and format the information
    in a table listing the chemical name, the quantity released, what it is typically
    used for and its effects on human health. But it took a few tries. Where it did
    save time was in explaining specialized information that might have otherwise
    taken a time-consuming Google search to figure out—such as decoding railroad car
    numbers.

    little: “You can skip the chit chat and pleasantries.” Users can instruct the
    bot to change the tone or style of their responses, but telling it that it is
    a lawyer [doesn’t make it more accurate](https://themarkup.org/hello-world/2024/01/06/what-happens-when-you-roleplay-with-chatgpt).'

    got its information, and redirecting it with precise instructions. It took a long

- en: Based on my interactions, by far the most useful capabilities of ChatGPT are
    its ability to generate and debug programming code. (At one point during the East
    Palestine exercise, it generated some simple [Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language))
    code for creating a map of the derailment.) When responding to a request to write
    code, it typically explains its approach (even though it may not be the best one),
    and shows its work, and you can redirect it to follow a different approach if
    you think its plan isn’t what you need. The ability to continually add to the
    features of your code while the AI agent retains the context and history of what
    you have been discussing can really save you a ton of time, avoiding painstaking
    searches for posts about a similar problem on StackOverflow (one of the largest
    online coding communities).

- en: The NICAR exercise left me with concerns about using generative AI tools for
    the precise work of data journalism. The fact that a tool as powerful as ChatGPT
    can’t produce a “receipt” of exactly how it knows something goes against everything
    we are trained to do as journalists. Also I worry about small, understaffed newsrooms
    relying upon these tools too much as the news industry struggles with layoffs
    and closures. And when there is a lack of guidance from newsroom leadership regarding
    the use of these tools, it could lead to errors and inaccuracies.

    drafting AI policies to help their journalists and their readers understand how
