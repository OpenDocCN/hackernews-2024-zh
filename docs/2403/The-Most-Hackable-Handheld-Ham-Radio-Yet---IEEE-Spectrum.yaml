    for much more than eavesdropping on the subway dispatcher when my train rumbles
    to a mysterious halt in a dark tunnel. But even I couldn’t help but hear the buzz
    surrounding a new handheld, [Quansheng’s UV-K5.](http://en.qsfj.com/products/3002)

- en: It caught my attention in part because for over a decade, [Baofeng](https://www.baofengradio.com/)
    has been *the* name in Chinese handhelds. In 2012 Baofeng made waves with its
    [UV-5R radio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baofeng_UV-5R), upending the sleepy
    handheld-transceiver market. Prior to the 5R, the price tag of the cheapest VHF/UHF
    handheld was a little north of US $100\. The 5R sold for a quarter to a third
    of that. Hams groused about the 5R’s so-so technical performance—and then bought
    a couple anyway, so they’d always have a radio in their car or workplace.

    be the most hackable handheld ever, with [a small army of dedicated hams](https://github.com/ludwich66/Quansheng_UV-K5_Wiki/wiki)
    adding a raft of software-based improvements and new features. I had to have one,
    and $30 later, I did.

    K5 here to refer to both the original K5 and the new [K5(8)](http://en.qsfj.com/products/3268)
    model.) The key technical distinction between the 5R and K5 is a seemingly minor
    design choice. With Baofeng’s 5R, the [firmware resides in read-only memory](https://forums.radioreference.com/threads/can-uv5r-firmware-be-flashed.352644/).
    But Quansheng stores the K5’s firmware in flash memory and made it possible to
    rewrite that memory with the same USB programming cable used to assign frequencies
    to preset channels.

- en: This feature has opened the door for improvements to the K5 that are well beyond
    what Quansheng offers out of the box. Hopefully, this design will inspire other
    radio makers to offer more support for modders, in turn bringing more innovation
    to the VHF and UHF radio bands.

- en: Quansheng probably thought of its design purely in terms of fixing software
    bugs or adjusting for regulatory changes—it offers a free install tool for uploading
    official firmware releases to the radio. But the prospect of an updatable radio
    dangled an irresistible temptation for folks to start reverse engineering the
    firmware and hardware so they could try writing their own code. Modifications
    to date have generally taken the form of patches to the official firmware, rather
    than wholesale rewrites. With the official firmware taking up most of the radio’s
    64 kilobytes of flash memory, such mods have to fit into less than 3 KB. And the
    CPU is not brimming with compute power—it’s a 48-megahertz, 32-bit [ARM-based
    processor](https://www.st.com/resource/en/datasheet/stm32g030c6.pdf) with 8 KB
    of RAM. Nonetheless, I found the results impressive.

    You can adjust the bandwidth, set a threshold for tuning into detected peaks automatically,
    and specify frequencies to ignore, among other things. Another mod allows you
    to exchange text messages between K5s. Other mods improve the K5’s ability to
    receive AM signals, meaning you can, say, listen in on aviation bands more clearly.
    And there are plenty of fun little mods that do things like change up the system
    fonts or replace the start-up message with a line-art image of your choice.'

    K5](https://whosmatt.github.io/uvmod/) that lets you pick a selection of mods
    from a menu. It then combines them with the official firmware to create a custom
    image for uploading (as long as you don’t exceed the total amount of memory).

    Quansheng’s installer to upload the firmware: You can update the radio’s flash
    memory directly from the browser via the built-in [Web Serial API](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/capabilities/serial)
    and the USB programming cable. (The instructions say this will work only on Linux
    and Windows, but I was able to do it using a Mac as well.) Web Serial could do
    with some improved error handling, though. The first USB programming cable I used
    was a bit flaky, but where Quansheng’s installer would halt and flag a communications
    error with a failed upload, Web Serial would silently crash and take the whole
    Windows operating system with it.'

- en: Of course, allowing unfettered modding of the K5’s transceiver does raise the
    possibility of abuse. For example, the Quansheng firmware blocks transmitting
    on the aviation band, to prevent illegal and hazardous interference. But this
    block can be removed by a patch (although to be a significant threat, you’d likely
    need an amplifier to boost the K5’s 5-watt signal).

    blocks. Such blocks are convenient for guarding against accidental abuse, but
    the truth is that unless problematic signals are persistent enough to allow a
    [transmitter’s location to be triangulated](https://www.fcc.gov/enforcement/areas/interference-resolution),
    amateur radio must continue to rely on an honor system, whether that means not
    [jamming a neighbor’s TV](https://www.arrl.org/files/file/Technology/Neighbor_Info/Neighbor_Info.pdf)
    or transmitting on forbidden frequencies.

    involve digital processing, and that processing is normally done using a computer
    connected to a transceiver. With embedded controllers becoming ever more powerful,
    the K5 modding scene points toward a future where more processing happens in-radio
    and where you can add new functions the way apps are added to smartphones. Here’s
    hoping manufacturers embrace that future!
