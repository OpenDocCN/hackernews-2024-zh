    contaminated nearby drinking water, put residents’ health at risk and destroyed
    their property value, a new federal [class-action lawsuit](https://static.sgtlaw.com/docs/depaul-v-kimberly-clark-complaint.pdf)
    alleges.

    from the plant are behind the region’s tainted drinking water wells, the suit
    charges. The plaintiffs are seeking $5m in damages and health monitoring costs.

    of industries](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlehtml/2020/em/d0em00291g)
    to make products water-, stain- or heat-resistant. They are in everyday consumer
    products such as stain guards, cookware and waterproof clothing, and are common
    in industrial manufacturing. The lawsuit is the first case involving facial tissues,
    though researchers previously [found the chemicals](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/mar/13/toxic-forever-chemicals-pfas-toilet-paper)
    in toilet paper.

    decreased immunity, hormone disruption and a range of other serious health issues.
    PFAS are dubbed “forever chemicals” because they do not naturally break down,
    and they also easily move through the environment, often ending up in drinking
    water.

    facility was once used to manufacture diapers, to which PFAS are sometimes added
    as a moisture barrier, and it continues to make 1m Kleenex tissue packages daily,
    the suit states.

    paper or tissues, and Kleenex’s manufacturing process causes “substantial “ air
    emissions, the complaint alleges.

- en: Most scientific research has focused on how PFAS waste is discharged into water,
    but recent evidence has brought into focus how air emissions contribute significantly
    to water pollution. PFAS sent into the air later land on the ground or surface
    water. Because they do not dissolve in water or break down in the environment,
    they can move through the soil and end up in groundwater, which is then pulled
    by wells.

    exist. When asked for clarification as to whether the company restricts all PFAS
    or just the two compounds, the Kleenex spokesperson said, “All I can share with
    you at this point is the statement we provided.”
