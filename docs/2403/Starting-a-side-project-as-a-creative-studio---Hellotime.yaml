    Here are our lessons learned while building Hellotime, the resource capacity planning
    app born out of our studio.

    way. We always loved working on products and always thought about starting our
    own.

    a minimalist to-do app for Mac. We started it in 2019 to develop skills in Swift
    and Xcode. At that time, we realized that “unconventional” and “simple” on the
    surface meant it “hard” under the hood. Our second project was Hellotime, our
    team planner app for teams doing client work.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A side project [...] is an endeavor pursued alongside one’s main activities,
    often during free time. It can be a creative, entrepreneurial, or learning initiative
    that allows individuals to explore their interests, build new skills, and express
    their creativity.

- en: For an agency, this means doing something alongside client work (the main activity).
    This could involve building a new product, a pet project, or conducting research.
    In other words, anything that is not paid by clients but drives new skills, profits,
    or even fun.

- en: With these premises, it’s clear that “success” isn’t binary. Do you aim for
    your team to develop new skills? That’s fine. When we launched Done, our focus
    was on learning new skills. Did Swift and Xcode become part of our studio’s skill
    set? Well, no. We hit the principles of the symmetry of ignorance. We were good
    at React, but native development was an entirely different challenge. Thanks to
    that side project, we decided to further invest in our existing React skills.
    Failure or a success? The definition of it is up to you, depending on your goals.

    a challenge the team is encountering. It might be, for example, a recurring issue
    within the scope of their actual work. As many suggest, it’s easier to focus on
    a problem that’s already known. Diving into a new topic from scratch—a problem
    you haven’t faced—is a much larger undertaking.

    to build the basics. By the end, we didn’t have the sign-up form ready, but the
    timeline was working. Then, we spent a few more weeks adding what was missing
    to start testing it ourselves.

    app for our studio’s use. The success criteria were whether the app could convince
    us, so we could then suggest others to try it out. This required some fixes, as
    what looked good on Figma didn’t always work well when built. In the end, we were
    happy with it; we used it ourselves and it met most real-world use cases.

    our need for a simple, easy-to-use, and sleek resource capacity planning app.
    Could we test our assumptions before building the product? Yes. And no. We began,
    of course, by discussing with other agencies about their use of resource capacity
    planning apps.
  prefs: []

    for validating your idea. A thoughtful post that shares what you’re working on,
    your learnings, and your drivers can be a good way to start.

    their interest and they trust you, they’ll join a waitlist. With Hellotime, we
    gathered dozens of access requests. Even now, some sign up but forget to complete
    their workspace setup when invited. We tried to address this with a double opt-in
    and an initial screener to gauge real interest. We also made sure to focus on
    those who fit our Ideal Customer Profile (ICP).

    The response can vary. When seeking early users for Hellotime, my Reddit posts
    received mixed reactions. Sometimes interest, sometimes indifference. I still
    don’t know why; maybe because of the wrong subreddits, posting times, or other
    reasons. The advice is to persist. Crafting messages that resonate with your ICP
    will maintain a consistent outreach.

    why random strangers DM you on LinkedIn, asking you to jump on a call. The key
    concept you can get from reading excellent books like “The Mom Test” is to explore
    context first. Instead of just talking about your idea, focus on discussing their
    life.
