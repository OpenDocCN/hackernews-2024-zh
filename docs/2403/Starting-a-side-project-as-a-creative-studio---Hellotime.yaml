    and Xcode. At that time, we realized that “unconventional” and “simple” on the

    often during free time. It can be a creative, entrepreneurial, or learning initiative
    that allows individuals to explore their interests, build new skills, and express
    their creativity.

    This could involve building a new product, a pet project, or conducting research.
    In other words, anything that is not paid by clients but drives new skills, profits,
    or even fun.

    your team to develop new skills? That’s fine. When we launched Done, our focus
    was on learning new skills. Did Swift and Xcode become part of our studio’s skill
    set? Well, no. We hit the principles of the symmetry of ignorance. We were good
    at React, but native development was an entirely different challenge. Thanks to
    that side project, we decided to further invest in our existing React skills.
    Failure or a success? The definition of it is up to you, depending on your goals.
