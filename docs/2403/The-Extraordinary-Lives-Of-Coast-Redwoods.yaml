- en: The big coast redwoods (Sequoia sempervirens) are magnificent, like news from
    another world. A few individuals grow to just shy of 400 feet, making them the
    tallest carbon-bearing organisms on Earth. We still don’t know why they get so
    high, nor why they’re not even taller. But their sheer bigness — their height,
    their circumference, their massive bulk, their huge payloads of tissue and carbon
    and ancient wood — relocates us. If we pay attention, they can lead us to our
    better selves. They can confront us with our frailties, our smallness and our
    puny life spans, while reassuring us that life can go on, and that if we are part
    of the living world, we too can go on. I find it reassuring that an entity this
    extraordinary can live while we live in a sliver of shared time.

    with others from the dim past. One survivor is the dawn redwood, which is native
    to just one valley in south-central China, although it plants well around the
    world. The other is the coast redwood’s cousin, the giant sequoia, Sequoiadendron
    giganteum, another huge tree often mistaken for the coast redwood despite no overlap
    in their ranges and different biology. The coast redwood lives almost exclusively
    along the upper California coast in a maritime climate, though a few, wantonly
    ignoring state lines, have pushed up into Oregon and down to Southern California.

    can be up to 25 feet in diameter near the ground. Explorers in the 1840s immediately
    logged the trees extensively; by most reliable accounts, there were about 2 million
    acres in existence when first “discovered.” More than 96% of the tree’s earlier
    acreage was lumbered down to about 90,000 old-growth individuals. Most of these
    giant conifers are now within areas protected by the state or the federal government,
    sheltering in place against the multifarious threats of the outside world.

    to roads mean that it’s easy to encounter whole groves in person. Our eyes are
    accustomed to being able to take in the extent of a tree, to make sense of its
    tree-ness. But when I saw a redwood for the first time, it struck me that the
    trees were more like massive, notched slabs of rock. They’re unmoving under your
    hands; they are striated and rough and stretch off to both sides, more akin to
    a wall than a tree. People climb them and speak of their heights with wide-eyed
    reverence. You crane your head up and can’t see the top. Mossy ledges higher up
    on the trees look for all the world like ledges on a rock face, with other species
    of trees growing on flattened protuberances.

    of long-gone riverbeds — is some 20 feet deep in places. The root system of the
    tree spreads roots laterally for ridiculous distances — nearly 100 feet, although
    in a relatively shallow fashion. The redwood’s bigness means it takes up a lot
    of ecological real estate. There are soil, air, water and chemical dramas. There
    are pollinators, incubators, microbes, contributors, givers, takers. All are actors
    in a production that stretches from the tips of the coast redwood’s roots to the

- en: As a rule, less water at the top of a tree means it’s harder for leaves to photosynthesize
    and expand. Individual trees in the drier, southern parts of the redwood’s range
    are shorter. But climate change will also modify the height equation in the coming
    decades, as higher CO2 levels, the carbon balance and changes in temperature and
    moisture will probably mean shorter trees. It takes a redwood weeks to pull water
    up from its roots to the canopy. Sucking water up a straw from a drinking glass
    is a trivial task. But as a straw gets longer and longer, the pressure needed
    to raise the water gets greater. The tree pulls mightily against the negative
    pressure generated by passing liquid through wood. The tallest redwoods probably
    generate some two million pounds of negative pressure.

    Earth on which the trees rest, their silent foundation, can also subvert them.
    A massive earthquake, a near certainty for the trees given how long they live,
    can end their lives like so many matchsticks falling out of a box. The Cascadia
    subduction zone, running from Vancouver Island in Canada down to northernmost
    coastal California, lies beneath the world’s highest concentration of old-growth
    redwoods. Subduction, a collision of two tectonic plates, can unleash a circular
    motion, a catastrophe trees probably never evolved to guard against. The tree
    rotates and whipsaws and then, like a cook snapping a length of celery, the ground
    movement shears off a huge part of the tree.

    The heavy mass of roots that forms a flat carpet at the surface of the ground
    can sink, tilting the tree. Or the tree’s taproot — the long central leader running
    straight down under the trunk — can die back, leaving a shallow series of roots
    unable to sustain the tree under the regular stresses of the local climate. Bark
    can slip from the trunk like loose, heavy sheets of fabric, coming off in unpredictable
    sizes and shapes. The trees, as Beranek noted, are “chock-full of defects: old
    wounds, new wounds, fire scars, splits and large open breaks.” All of these injuries
    give openings to organisms that contribute to the trees’ decline, hastening rotting
    and large cavities. Just as humans stretch and wrinkle and sag, so too with these
    trees.'

    sprouting up new growth or serving as host to other plants, a garden of its own.
    To be born is to die is to be born, as the trees engage in a quiet but pitched
    battle. As the stem and roots break down into mulch and duff, enough organic material
    assembles to support other life. Vines, ferns and other trees rise straight up.

    pose even greater threats than the movement of earth and water, we can find surprising
    oases of hope in a landscape of climate dread. The survival and growth of more
    heat-adapted organisms within the redwoods’ ecosystems offers one example. Another
    is evidence that after recent fires of unprecedented severity, 95% of the coast
    redwoods survived and regenerated, a much higher percentage than for other species
    of large trees in the fire areas studied.

    researchers studying the redwood’s genetic variation collected seeds from specimens
    on hot, dry ridges, presumably ones that had undergone some genetic adaptation
    to the warmer, drier climate by dint of their survival there. They then moved
    the 34 seedlings grown from those seeds to a pair of test sites at the eastern,
    inland limit of the tree’s range, an even warmer region where no other redwoods
    occurred, to see whether they could take root and thrive. Many of the clones performed
    well at each of the test sites.

    places; there is a distinct sense of the sacred. As the writer Anne Lamott noted,
    “The trees are so huge that they shut you up.” Their mass dampens sound, and people
    in and around them tend to speak in quiet, reverent tones, as often happens when
    walking among giants.

    on what is most biologically active at the time. On cold, dark, damp winter days,
    there are a lot of fungi and molds at work in the forest, and the air can become
    acrid, funky, moldy. The smells are signaling chemicals, communication between
    organisms, some attracting insects to pollinate and disperse seeds.

    value it for itself until we can bring ourselves to give it ‘rights’ — which is
    almost inevitably going to sound inconceivable to a large group of people.” However,
    the concept continues to gain traction.

    think, about nonhuman entities. Robin Wall Kimmerer, in her book “Braiding Sweetgrass,”
    writes movingly and convincingly about the grammar of animacy. “To name and describe
    you must first see, and science polishes the gift of seeing,” she notes. But when
    we tell someone a tree is an it and not a who, “we absolve ourselves of moral
    responsibility and open the door to exploitation.” It’s much harder, she points
    out, to turn a chainsaw onto a “she” than onto an “it.”

    keenly understood how much they were at the mercy of their environment, dependent
    on the natural world for their very survival, and rivers and mountains had the
    last word. But the power of law, more than issues of moral suasion, may now be
    the tool that finally urges us, even coerces us, as a civilized world, to take
    action on the idea that nature deserves to live on its own terms, not ours. Ultimately,
    it’s a survival strategy for humans as much as for the trees.

    classic markers of intelligence. Cognition — the ability to detect environmental
    variables — is sometimes confused with consciousness, which leads to its rejection
    as being present in plants. But philosophers of biology have argued convincingly
