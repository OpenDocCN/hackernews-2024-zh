- en: The big coast redwoods (Sequoia sempervirens) are magnificent, like news from
    another world. A few individuals grow to just shy of 400 feet, making them the
    tallest carbon-bearing organisms on Earth. We still don’t know why they get so
    high, nor why they’re not even taller. But their sheer bigness — their height,
    their circumference, their massive bulk, their huge payloads of tissue and carbon
    and ancient wood — relocates us. If we pay attention, they can lead us to our
    better selves. They can confront us with our frailties, our smallness and our
    puny life spans, while reassuring us that life can go on, and that if we are part
    of the living world, we too can go on. I find it reassuring that an entity this
    extraordinary can live while we live in a sliver of shared time.

    with others from the dim past. One survivor is the dawn redwood, which is native
    to just one valley in south-central China, although it plants well around the
    world. The other is the coast redwood’s cousin, the giant sequoia, Sequoiadendron
    giganteum, another huge tree often mistaken for the coast redwood despite no overlap
    in their ranges and different biology. The coast redwood lives almost exclusively
    along the upper California coast in a maritime climate, though a few, wantonly
    ignoring state lines, have pushed up into Oregon and down to Southern California.

    can be up to 25 feet in diameter near the ground. Explorers in the 1840s immediately
    logged the trees extensively; by most reliable accounts, there were about 2 million
    acres in existence when first “discovered.” More than 96% of the tree’s earlier
    acreage was lumbered down to about 90,000 old-growth individuals. Most of these
    giant conifers are now within areas protected by the state or the federal government,

    accustomed to being able to take in the extent of a tree, to make sense of its
    tree-ness. But when I saw a redwood for the first time, it struck me that the
    trees were more like massive, notched slabs of rock. They’re unmoving under your
    hands; they are striated and rough and stretch off to both sides, more akin to
    a wall than a tree. People climb them and speak of their heights with wide-eyed
    reverence. You crane your head up and can’t see the top. Mossy ledges higher up

    tree spreads roots laterally for ridiculous distances — nearly 100 feet, although
    in a relatively shallow fashion. The redwood’s bigness means it takes up a lot
    of ecological real estate. There are soil, air, water and chemical dramas. There
    are pollinators, incubators, microbes, contributors, givers, takers. All are actors

- en: As a rule, less water at the top of a tree means it’s harder for leaves to photosynthesize
    and expand. Individual trees in the drier, southern parts of the redwood’s range
    are shorter. But climate change will also modify the height equation in the coming
    decades, as higher CO2 levels, the carbon balance and changes in temperature and
    moisture will probably mean shorter trees. It takes a redwood weeks to pull water
    up from its roots to the canopy. Sucking water up a straw from a drinking glass
    is a trivial task. But as a straw gets longer and longer, the pressure needed
    to raise the water gets greater. The tree pulls mightily against the negative
    pressure generated by passing liquid through wood. The tallest redwoods probably
    generate some two million pounds of negative pressure.
