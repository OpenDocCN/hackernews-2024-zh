    [memo](https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/guardrailsafety/guardrail101.pdf), a guardrail
    will “deflect a vehicle back to the roadway [or] slow the vehicle down to a complete
    stop.” Your car will probably be damaged, but guardrails can prevent something
    much worse.

    demonstrates, sending their passengers hurtling toward a ditch, cliff, or whatever
    is on the other side. The problem is that thousands of miles of guardrails installed
    alongside American highways were designed decades ago, when vehicles were much
    lighter than the behemoths that [increasingly dominate](https://jalopnik.com/trucks-and-suvs-are-now-over-80-percent-of-new-car-sale-1848427797)

    of big cars are poised to arrive in the years ahead. The risk of huge vehicles
    tearing through guardrails is yet another reason to expect [American car bloat](https://slate.com/business/2023/12/cars-trucks-suv-sales-electric-safety-risk.html)

    comes from the University of Nebraska, which received funding from the U.S. Army
    to examine the impact of electric vehicles on guardrails. The university is a
    natural location for such research; its [Midwest Roadside Safety Facility](https://mwrsf.unl.edu/)
    designed and tested the metal barriers known as the [Midwest Guardrail System](https://mwrsf.unl.edu/mgs.php)
    that are a familiar sight along American highways. The MGS is a beam with a dip
    running horizontally in the middle—if you think of a guardrail, you’re probably
    picturing one. “It’s the most frequently used guardrail system, because it’s the
    cheapest to install and maintain,” said University of Nebraska engineering professor
    Cody Stolle, noting that all 50 states use it.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The current version of MGS was developed to withstand cars weighing a maximum
    of 5,000 pounds, but many of today’s SUVs and trucks exceed that threshold. A
    Cadillac Escalade, for instance, now weighs [over 6,200 pounds](https://media.cadillacarabia.com/media/us/en/cadillac/vehicles/escalade-v/2024.tab1.html),
    and the latest model of the Ford F-150, the most popular vehicle in America, can
    tip the scales at [almost 5,700 pounds](https://www.jdemmerford.com/research/new-ford-f-150-weight.htm).
    You don’t really want to hit a guardrail with a vehicle like that, but electrification
    can make things even dicier. Electric cars often weigh [around 30 percent](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/01/electric-vehicles-suv-battery-climate-safety/672576/)
    more than a gas-powered counterpart, because big vehicles require enormous batteries
    to propel them hundreds of miles between charges. The goliath-like GMC Hummer
    EV weighs a staggering 9,083 pounds, [2 tons more](https://www.fastcompany.com/90790197/yes-to-electric-cars-but-not-the-hummer-ev)
    than a gas-guzzling H3.

    weighing around [7,000 pounds](https://www.caranddriver.com/rivian/r1t) toward
    an MGS guardrail at 62 mph and a 25-degree angle, reflecting common highway crash
    conditions. The Rivian demolished the guardrail, passing through it before striking
    a concrete barrier that the researchers had installed as a backstop.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The silver lining, Stolle told me, was that the Rivian seemed capable of protecting
    passengers in that test. “The damage to the interior of the vehicle was very low,”
    he said, “and the occupant risk in that scenario would not be cause for alarm.”
    But he noted that in the real world, a guardrail is much more likely to be placed
    next to a steep dropoff than a concrete barrier. If a car penetrates a guardrail
    and tumbles down an incline, passengers would face far greater danger.

    After all, you can buy an EV [that weighs less than 5,000 pounds](https://www.recurrentauto.com/research/how-much-does-an-electric-car-weigh).
    You just can’t electrify your favorite already-large car—or even buy a hulking
    gas-powered car—and expect guardrails to work as intended. “Weight is a universal
    problem; it is not unique to electric vehicles,” Stolle said. “We have similar
    concerns about the compatibility of the biggest gas-powered cars with our guardrail
    system.” The [6,700-pound](https://www.caranddriver.com/chevrolet/silverado-1500/specs)
    Chevrolet Silverado 1500 already weighs too much, based on the result from this
    research, and the [8,500-pound](https://www.caranddriver.com/chevrolet/silverado-1500/specs)
    Silverado EV weighs even *more*.

    the highway would require a wholesale upgrade of the nation’s guardrail installations,
    which Stolle estimated to cover at least 50,000 miles. Assuming a materials cost
    of [$30 per foot](https://roadskyguardrail.com/how-much-does-highway-guardrail-cost),
    replacing all MGS guardrails could easily hit $8 billion, not including installation
    expenses that would drive the price tag much higher. (Retrofits could be less
    expensive, but Stolle said it’s too soon to know if they would be feasible.) To
    put that figure in perspective, $8 billion exceeds North Carolina’s entire [annual
    transportation expenditures](https://www.ncdot.gov/about-us/how-we-operate/finance-budget/Pages/default.aspx#:~:text=The%20Highway%20Fund%20primarily%20supports,North%20Carolina%20based%20on%20need.),

    interest in assuming responsibility for a future guardrail overhaul, saying that
    “states and local governments are responsible for properly selecting, installing,
    maintaining, and replacing roadside safety hardware, including guardrails,” and
    requesting that further questions be directed to them.
