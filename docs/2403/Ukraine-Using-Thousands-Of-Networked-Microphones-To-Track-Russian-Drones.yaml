    country to help detect and track incoming Russian kamikaze drones, alert traditional
    air defenses in advance, and also dispatch [ad hoc drone hunting teams](https://www.twz.com/ukrainian-teams-hunt-russian-drones-with-laser-rifles-gun-trucks-apps)
    to shoot them down. This is according to the U.S. Air Force's top officer in Europe
    who also said the U.S. military is now looking to test this capability to see
    if it might help meet its own demands for additional ways to persistently monitor
    for, and engag,e drone threats.

    provided the details about Ukraine's acoustic sensor network and related air and
    missile defense issues at a press roundtable that *The War Zone* and other outlets
    attended earlier today. This gathering took place on the sidelines of this year's
    Air & Space Forces [Association Warfare Symposium](https://www.afa.org/afa-warfare-symposium/),

    explained. "And you have … 6,000 of these things all over the country. They''ve
    been successful in being able to pick up the one-way UAVs like [Shahed 136s](https://www.twz.com/news-features/what-does-a-shahed-136-really-cost)

    track them and then eventually put that together, get that picture out to a mobile
    ... team that is further out, that now shoots it down with AAA [anti-aircraft
    artillery], [which] they train a guy in six hours how to utilize," Hecker added.

    very well involve leveraging [an existing ad hoc drone spotting network](https://www.twz.com/ukrainian-teams-hunt-russian-drones-with-laser-rifles-gun-trucks-apps)
    that Ukraine has had in place for some time now that allows volunteers to post

    various types of anti-aircraft guns, reflects broader comments he made today about
    the cost-effectiveness of those weapons against drones. We will come back to that
    one later.

    typically consisting of various types of machine guns and automatic cannons mounted
    on different types of light vehicles. Their means of spotting and tracking drones
    themselves, especially at night, are typically limited to very localized capabilities
    like night vision and thermal [optics, laser pointers, and searchlights](https://www.twz.com/ukrainian-teams-hunt-russian-drones-with-laser-rifles-gun-trucks-apps).

    outside of NATO, too, and potentially against other categories of aerial threats
    beyond drones. It's worth noting that before the widespread adoption of radar,
    the U.S. military and other armed forces around the world [used various types
    of systems](https://www.cnn.com/style/article/war-sound-locators-before-radar/index.html)
    designed to detect incoming aircraft based on their acoustic signature. By the
    end of World War II, such systems had largely fallen into disuse.

    significant [challenges to even current-generation radars](https://www.twz.com/air/polands-plan-to-deploy-early-warning-radar-blimps-moves-forward).
    Gen. Hecker first mentioned the U.S. military's interest in Ukraine's acoustic
    sensor network at the roundtable today while talking about challenges NATO is
    facing in maintaining a persistent ISR picture when it comes to things like kamikaze
    drones and cruise missiles.

    picture, ISR picture, down to low altitude, where many of these one-way UAVs and

    airborne early warning and control aircraft [that the Air Force](https://www.twz.com/air-force-to-buy-e-7-wedgetail-radar-jets-to-replace-aging-e-3s)

    capacity to detect these one-way UAVs" as something that he was hoping would be
    "delivered" within six months to a year. "And now you get that for a long time,
    right? … it can stay up pretty much nonstop unless the winds get really struggling,
    and you may have to reel it down for a little bit."

    military is planning to deploy in Europe or somewhere else, or something that
    might be happening elsewhere within NATO. The U.S. government did just recently
    approve a possible sale of aerostat-based aerial surveillance systems to Poland,
    which you can read more about [here](https://www.twz.com/air/polands-plan-to-deploy-early-warning-radar-blimps-moves-forward).

    that then we can predict how fast they're going [and] what heading they're on,"
    Hecker noted. "Then we can use things that get us on the right side of the cost
    curve, like AAA, ... something that we haven't probably talked about in a long
    time. But [it is] very cost efficient using AAA [to] take these things [like kamikaze
    drones] down."

    of coming up with a low-cost solution to taking these things down" even more pronounced,
    according to Hecker. "I''m working hard with industry to ... come up with a solution
    that puts us on the right side of the cost curve. So we''re not taking a $700,000
    missile and shooting down a $5,000 drone."'

    the Middle East in recent weeks as examples of how this threat is already expanding

    U.S. service members](https://www.twz.com/drone-attack-in-jordan-kills-3-american-troops)

    the attention of the U.S. military. He also highlighted unspecified "things to
    distract an IADS [integrated air defense system] that [are] relatively cheap,"
    when asked about other capabilities being employed in Ukraine now that could be
    of interest to American forces. It's unclear whether this comment about decoy
    capabilities refers to [ones the Ukrainians](https://www.twz.com/evidence-of-adm-160-miniature-air-launched-decoy-use-by-ukraine-emerges),
    [the Russians](https://www.twz.com/russian-kh-101-cruise-missile-filmed-firing-off-decoy-flares),
    or both have been employing in the conflict, a [topic *The War Zone*](https://www.twz.com/is-russia-now-firing-denuclearized-cruise-missiles-at-ukraine)
    has [been following closely](https://www.twz.com/balloons-shot-down-over-kyiv-point-to-new-russian-tactics).
    The general might have even been referring to the use of kamikaze drones as decoys,
    an adjacent role that many such designs would be well suited for as [we have highlighted
    in the past](https://www.twz.com/ukraines-jet-powered-uj-25-skyline-drone-appears-on-battlefield).
    Just using the Shaheds to prove routes to target areas, and stimulating enemy
    air defenses along the way, so that higher-end systems, like cruise missiles,
    can be sent after them in a more survivable manner is a known tactic.

    be new near-term way for the U.S. military to move forward in addressing the drone
    threat, as well as providing a more persistent ISR picture for air defenders overall,
    especially when it comes to small and low-flying targets.
