    is the first to look at the growth of giant sequoias in the UK – and they seem
    to be doing remarkably well. Trees at two of the three sites we studied matched
    the [average growth rates](https://arboretum.ucdavis.edu/sites/g/files/dgvnsk1546/files/inline-files/redwood_exhibits_0.pdf)
    of their counterparts in the US, where they come from. These remarkable trees
    are being planted in an effort to help absorb carbon, but perhaps more importantly
    they are becoming a striking and much-admired part of the UK landscape.

    In their [native northern California](https://www.visitsequoia.com/explore/spring-summer-fall-activities/redwoods-and-sequoias),
    they occupy an ecological niche in mountainous terrain 1400 – 2100 metres above

    CO₂ faster and in greater quantities than almost any other in the world, storing
    up to five times more carbon per hectare than even tropical rainforests. However,
    the changing climate means Californian giant sequoias [are under threat](https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/giant-sequoias-face-new-threats.htm)

    UK giant sequoias doing? To try and answer this, my team used a technique called
    [terrestrial laser scanning](https://info.vercator.com/blog/3-types-of-terrestrial-laser-scanners)
    to measure the size and volume of giant sequoias.

    the 3D location of each “hit” is recorded precisely. This gives us a map of tree
    structure in unprecedented detail, which we can use to estimate volume and mass,
    effectively allowing us to estimate the tree’s weight. If we know how old the
    trees are, we can estimate how fast they are growing and accumulating carbon.

    colleagues at Kew Royal Botanical Gardens, we measured giant sequoias across three
    sites - [Benmore botanical gardens](https://www.rbge.org.uk/visit/benmore-botanic-garden/)
    in Scotland, [Kew Wakehurst](https://www.kew.org/wakehurst) in Sussex and [Havering
    Country Park](https://www.havering.gov.uk/info/20037/parks/723/havering_country_park)
    in Essex. These sites span the wettest (Benmore) and driest (Havering) climates
    in the UK, enabling us to assess how rainfall affects growth.

    in California, adding 70cm of height and storing 160kg of carbon per year, about
    twice that of a [native UK oak](https://onetreeplanted.org/blogs/stories/how-much-co2-does-tree-absorb).
    The trees at Benmore are already among the tallest trees in the UK at 55 metres,
    the current record-holder being a [66 metre Douglas Fir](https://www.outdoorlook.co.uk/blog/post/record-breaking-tall-trees-in-the-uk)
    in Scotland. The redwoods, being faster growing, are likely to take that title
    in the next decade or two. And these trees are “only” around 170 years old. No
    native tree in the UK is taller than about 47 metres. We also found significant
    differences in growth rates across the UK. They grow fastest in the north where
    the climate is wetter.

    was big business in the 18th and 19th centuries, in large part as a display of
    wealth and taste. Giant sequoias were first introduced in 1853 by Scottish grain
    merchant and keen amateur collector [Patrick Matthew](https://www.giant-sequoia.com/gallery/scotland/),
    who gave them to friends. Later that same year commercial nurseryman [William
    Lobb](https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/discover/nature/trees-plants/how-the-giant-sequoia-came-to-england)
    brought many more from California, along with accounts of the giant trees from
    which they came.

    avenues, at the entrances of grand houses and estates, in churchyards, parks and

    which tend to grow in forests, due to lightning strikes and high winds – always
    a risk when you’re the tallest thing in the landscape rather than one among many.
    More recently, there has been a [resurgence in planting](https://press.royalsociety.org/Uploads/RSOS230603_Proof.pdf)
    giant sequoias in the UK, particularly [in urban settings](https://news.hackney.gov.uk/hackney-plants-70-trees-to-commemorate-70th-day-of-the-70th-year-of-the-queens-reign/#:%7E:text=Hackney%20has%20planted%2070%20sequoia,the%20borough's%20Platinum%20Jubilee%20celebrations.).
    This is because of their carbon storage potential and perhaps because people seem
