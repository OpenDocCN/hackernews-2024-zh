API
for distributed applications

Start rate limiting user actions with a couple of lines.
Protect your applications from abuse and ensure high availability for all users.

*   **Works everywhere** - our API can be used with any language and framework
*   **Flexible** - rate limit by your internal metadata, like account/user ID per operation
*   **Highly available** - deployed across multiple regions, low latency, high availability
*   **Real-time events** - see rate limit requests as they happen
