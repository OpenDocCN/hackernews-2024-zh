    and distortions are themselves more likely to be fooled by impressive-sounding
    misinformation, new research from the University of Waterloo shows.

- en: The researchers found that people who frequently engage in “persuasive bullshitting”
    were actually quite poor at identifying it. Specifically, they had trouble distinguishing
    intentionally profound or scientifically accurate fact from impressive but meaningless
    fiction. Importantly, these frequent BSers are also much more likely to fall for
    fake news headlines.

    but our research suggests that this isn’t actually the case,” says Shane Littrell,
    lead author of the paper and cognitive psychology PhD candidate at Waterloo. “In
    fact, it appears that the biggest purveyors of persuasive bullshit are ironically
    some of the ones most likely to fall for it.”

- en: The researchers define “bullshit” as information designed to impress, persuade,
    or otherwise mislead people that is often constructed without concern for the
    truth. They also identify two types of bullshitting— persuasive and evasive. “Persuasive”
    uses misleading exaggerations and embellishments to impress, persuade, or fit
    in with others, while ‘evasive’ involves giving irrelevant, evasive responses
    in situations where frankness might result in hurt feelings or reputational harm.

    Canada, the researchers examined the relations between participants’ self-reported
    engagement in both types of BSing and their ratings of how profound, truthful,
    or accurate they found pseudo-profound and pseudo-scientific statements and fake
    news headlines. Participants also completed measures of cognitive ability, metacognitive
    insight, intellectual overconfidence, and reflective thinking.

    the more likely they are to be duped by various types of misleading information
    regardless of their cognitive ability, engagement in reflective thinking, or metacognitive
    skills,” Littrell said. “Persuasive BSers seem to mistake superficial profoundness
    for actual profoundness. So, if something simply sounds profound, truthful, or
    accurate to them that means it really is. But evasive bullshitters were much better
    at making this distinction.”

    types of misinformation, which could have important implications for the fight
    against this growing problem.
