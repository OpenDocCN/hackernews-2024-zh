    meant to give rise to fallen so woefully short?

- en: According to Liz Truss, the former prime minister, it’s all down to the “deep
    state”, a suffocating conspiracy of bureaucrats and quangos that is determined
    to thwart the noble ambitions of elected politicians such as herself. Truss, by
    the way, campaigned for Remain, but then there is no zealot quite like the convert.

    and the shortcomings of [non elected technocrats](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2024/02/21/civil-service-union-shorter-week-same-pay/),
    but her take on events is essentially just a lot of paranoid nonsense straight
    out of the populist playbook, where an imaginary “enemy within” is created as
    a hate plank to channel the discontents of voters.

- en: It was up to Brexit’s political cheerleaders to make something out of Britain’s
    decision to leave the European Union, whatever the obstacles, but they failed.
    They over promised and under delivered, and the presiding government is now about
    to reap the whirlwind.

    credible excuse of the pandemic; it was because the vision of Singapore-on-Thames
    was always a fantasy that would never be capable of uniting the nation behind
    it.

    the same time launching an unprecedented package of “big state” energy subsidies,
    it predictably ended in tears.

    blocks needed to create a functioning enterprise economy. But you cannot defy
    gravity; her plans were never going to pass muster with markets.

    crisis that erupted, because she had in fact dispensed with its services. Markets
    drew the obvious conclusion – that the OBR would never have weathered her fiscal
    incontinence.
