    This means you can connect to them using any Postgres client and generally use
    them as you would use any other Postgres database, while **still keeping** everything

    In November 2022, we [launched](https://xata.io/blog/xata-public-release) the
    Xata database service with a product that aimed to provide the best possible developer
    experience for a database. We felt back then that databases have been left behind
    a little when it comes to modern developer workflows, APIs, and experience in
    general. So we re-thought things from the ground up, without tying ourselves to
    any existing database technology.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We imagined our product as the middle ground between Airtable and traditional
    databases, and we think we've done a pretty good job at sticking to that vision.
    Like in Airtable, "xatabases" start instantly, have rich types, have no cold starts,
    and are never paused. Like in traditional databases, they have no row limitations,
    have ACID transactions, constraints with referential integrity, and are highly
    performant.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Since then, tens of thousands of developers discovered Xata, actively used it
    in their applications, and have given us extremely valuable feedback. Developers
    in our [community](https://xata.io/blog/tags/community) appreciate how easy Xata
    is to get started with, iterate quickly, and the feeling that it's more like a
    SaaS product than another DBaaS.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    of a database platform, as opposed to a DBaaS. From a new git-like [developer
    workflow](https://xata.io/blog/workflow-github-vercel-netlify-xata) for making
    schema changes with our branching functionality, to [file attachments](https://xata.io/blog/file-attachments),
    which make it easy to work with files and images as columns in your database.
    These features generated a [lot](https://x.com/rauchg/status/1651614599874252802?s=20)

    a tool that provides zero-downtime and reversible schema migrations for any PostgreSQL
    database. This has also generated [quite](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37752366)
    a bit of [interest](https://simonwillison.net/2024/Jan/30/pgroll/) from the broader

    zones.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When it comes to horizontal scaling, the fact that you can create databases
    and branches instantly across the globe and that you can move them between clusters
    without downtime, opens up several architectural possibilities. For example, you
    can create a logical database for each of your customers, and place them in different
    regions. This is possible thanks to our [global control plane and logical databases](/docs/concepts/serverless-data-platform#global-control-plane-for-databases-and-branches).

    for across a wide range of use cases. Xata makes it really easy to move from one
    type of cluster to another, so you can try your workload on different types of
    clusters to determine which is the best fit from a performance and cost-efficiency
    perspective.

    and auto-scaling.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: At large scale, when using [dedicated clusters](/docs/dedicated-cluster) (currently
    in private alpha) you pay for the resources you use and have a high degree of
    control. For example, for predictable load, you can configure a particular instance
    size, while for an unpredictable load, auto-scaling might be more cost-efficient.
    Similarly, you can choose between standard storage and I/O optimized storage,
    which is more cost-efficient for I/O-heavy workloads.

    you might be looking a bit skeptically at our 15GB free storage, HA included,

    many years (and lost in minutes), that we are a startup doing startup-y things,
    and that interest rates *something something*, but we think there are a couple
    things that are worth saying:'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: First, the Xata architecture was built from the start to be able to offer a
    free tier sustainably, thanks to the use of shared clusters and auto-scaling.
    Currently, a free **active** database with constant traffic within the rate limits
    costs us less than $1.5/month. That includes not only Postgres but also Elasticsearch
    and the replication between them, as well as running two replicas for high-availability.
    This is possible thanks to our shared clusters (see [The implementation](#the-implementation)).
    The cost per database will go further down as we disable search and replication
    if not used at all, offload databases to cold storage if inactive for several
    months, and so on. In other words, while an active free-tier database that makes
    use of all the features might cost us a couple of dollars per month, the cost
    of a mostly inactive free database will come close to zero.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Secondly, the free tier is important to us because of the company history. The
    idea of Xata was born out of a [non-profit](https://www.tupu.io/), when we realized
    that managing databases is a limiting factor for many small projects. Today I'm
    proud to say that multiple non-profits are building on top of Xata, some on the
    free tier.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'It''s quite possible to use Xata as a Postgres service and nothing else, and
    we couldn''t be happier if you do. However, the way we think about Xata is not
    as a Postgres DBaaS, but as a **data platform for PostgreSQL**: multiple services
    and tools, integrated together much more tightly than in a classical cloud provider
    to simplify the way developers build data-centric applications and manage databases.'

    to Elasticsearch, which serves our search, vector search, and aggregations endpoints,
    so the areas in which it excels. Files are stored in S3 and served through the
    Cloudflare CDN. The replication events are used to keep a reference count of the
    files, so they can be shared between branches, yet deleted when they are no longer
    needed.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If file attachments or full-text search or vector/hybrid search are important
    for your application, Xata will likely offer you a better platform to build on
    top of than a classical DBaaS. And it's only the beginning, we are planning to
    have similar tightly-integrated solutions for time-series, intelligent caching,
    queuing, and more.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One key concept in the Xata implementation is the notion of *logical database
    branches*. A database can have multiple branches, and always has at least one,
    called `main` by default. A database branch is represented in Postgres as a [schema](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/ddl-schemas.html),
    and can be allocated on one of many Postgres clusters around the world, as well
    as moved from one cluster to another.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This results in a level of decoupling between the logical databases and branches
    as experienced by the application, and the underlying Postgres instances where
    they are running. Because the clusters are already provisioned, logical databases
    and branches can be started instantly and allocated and moved depending on the
    business needs. This unlocks some interesting use cases, like sharding per tenant
    where every tenant is a branch, using a logical database for each micro-service,
    or automatically creating developer branches for each pull request. We use this
    logical separation in our free tier, where many small databases and branches share
    the same relatively large underlying Postgres cluster.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The key to the solution for most of these issues is our SQL Proxy technology.
    While there are many Postgres proxies (e.g. pgbouncer, pgcat, Supavisor) serving
    various goals, the Xata SQL Proxy not only speaks the Postgres wire protocol,
    but also understands the SQL being executed at a fairly deep level. It can, for
    example, know which tables are accessed, which columns are requested, which functions
    are being called with which parameters, and so on. This allows us to block actions
    that would be dangerous for the Postgres cluster. While security is mostly ensured
    via Postgres roles, the Proxy can enforce rate and concurrency limits on shared
    clusters (we don't do this for dedicated clusters).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The Proxy allows us to "virtualize" access not only to the data in the branch,
    but also to the Postgres catalog of tables, functions, sequences, and so on. ORMs
    like Prisma and Drizzle do fairly complex introspection to see the tables and
    columns that are currently defined, and we wanted to make sure they work without
    any modifications.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You might be wondering why we chose to represent database branches as Postgres
    schemas rather than separate Postgres databases. The reason has to do with logical
    replication, which is a key component of the database platform, because reliable
    change-data-capture (CDC) is such an important feature keeping multiple data stores
    in sync. Individual databases would have forced us to do a replication slot for
    each.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Speaking of logical replication, another challenge that we had to solve was
    getting not only data events, but also schema events from Postgres. A well known
    limitation of the Postgres logical replication system is that it only includes
    data changes, not DDL changes. Yet, having schema changes in the same stream of
    events significantly simplifies the downstream consumers for the logical replication
    events. The way we solve this is by installing [DDL event triggers](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/event-triggers.html)
    that are writing the schema changes to an "out-box" table, which gets replicated
    via the same replication slot.

    our open-source project for zero-downtime, reversible, schema migrations.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: While `pgroll` is a CLI tool, in order to offer its benefits to all the Xata
    users, we have developed a server wrapper for it, which integrates with our control
    plane. This server offers an API for specific migrations as well as automatically
    intercepts DDLs executed over the wire protocol. This allows us to offer some
    of the benefits of pgroll nativly in the Xata platform, without you even having
    to know that you are using pgroll!
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'While there is still work to do to fully integrate pgroll, you already get
    some important benefits: maintaining a history of the schema migrations, avoiding
    [locking issues](https://xata.io/blog/postgres-schema-changes-pita) automatically,
    and enabling more complex migrations that require data backfill. We don''t yet
    expose multiple versions of the schema at the same time, but we are planning to
    do so in the future. This will be key to enabling a simple and safe workflow for
    schema migrations of all kinds, and we''re excited for that future.'
