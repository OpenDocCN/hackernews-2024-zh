# Apple 'like The Godfather' with new App Store rules - BBC News

Apple is now the biggest smartphone seller globally and has the most affluent user base, so getting his store on to iPhones would be a major win.

Colton's excitement diminished though when he and his team started reading Apple's terms and conditions.

He compares Apple's rules to a gangster from The Godfather or Sopranos. Yes, you can open your shop on their turf, but you have to do exactly as they say or they will shut you down.

Apple insists that new app shops have €1m (£851,000) in the bank, but if their reserves dip below that figure, they can be closed down. Apple did not respond to our questions about why this is needed, but has previously said it is about weeding out dodgy, or scam, stores.

In the last few weeks, since Colton secured his line of credit, Apple has said that app developers of "good standing" for at least two years can also build an app shop without the €1m.

Colton's next hurdle to overcome is how to make a profit. Apple automatically bills new app stores half a euro for every download after one million. Apple says this Core Technology Fee is about keeping iPhones safe through security updates.

But Colton feels this is like a so-called protection fee paid to a mob under the guise of making sure a shop owner's business is safe.

So if someone downloads his app shop app but never uses it, he still has to pay Apple 50 cents.
