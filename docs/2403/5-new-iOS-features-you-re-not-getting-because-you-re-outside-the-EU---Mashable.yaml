- en: By now, you've likely heard of the Digital Markets Act (DMA). These new EU regulations
    went into effect last week and forced Big Tech companies, known as "gatekeepers,"
    to open up their core platforms to third parties in order to keep the tech space
    competitive.

    perhaps no company has been compelled to make such significant changes more than
    Apple. The iPhone maker had to broadly change long-standing policies for many
    of its core products like the App Store. Apple's DMA-inspired changes have also
    been widely criticized by peers in the tech industry.

    elsewhere in the world envious that their country hasn't also passed a similar
    set of antitrust laws.

    is easily the biggest change to the company's mobile ecosystem. Thanks to the
    DMA, Apple has been forced to allow "[alternative marketplaces](https://mashable.com/article/apple-app-store-eu-dma-policy-criticism)"
    to distribute apps on the iPhone and iPad.

    App Store's content and development policies for the very first time. So, users
    can look forward to different types of apps that previously may have been prohibited
    from the App Store.

    model for transactions, such as in-app purchases, that entail giving a percentage
    of their sales to Apple. This means that developers can potentially pass the savings
    on to consumers.

    it from iOS as a whole.

    (Apple recently tried to [block](https://mashable.com/article/apple-terminates-epic-games-ios-developer-account)
    Epic Games from its developer program, which would have halted the company's plans
    to create an alternative marketplace and would have potentially stopped Fortnite's
    return to iOS. However, the DMA also forced Apple to [reverse](https://mashable.com/article/apple-unbans-epic-games-dma-fortnite)
    that decision.)

    options that will let users pick the default app they want to use for a web browser

    Apple said it will start accepting interoperability requests from developers,

    can give developers access to APIs previously unavailable to them, which would
    let these third parties create new apps utilizing these features and its relevant
