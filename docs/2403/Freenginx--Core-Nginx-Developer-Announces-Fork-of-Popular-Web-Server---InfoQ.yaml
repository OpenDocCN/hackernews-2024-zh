    announced the fork [Freenginx](http://freenginx.org/) of the popular web server.
    The new project was started to [address a security dispute](https://mailman.nginx.org/pipermail/nginx-devel/2024-February/K5IC6VYO2PB7N4HRP2FUQIBIBCGP4WAU.html)
    and wants to be a drop-in replacement of Nginx, run by developers rather than
    corporate entities. [Maxim Dounin](http://mdounin.ru/), formerly principal software
    engineer at F5, provides insights into the fork:'

    they know better how to run open-source projects. In particular, they decided
    to interfere with the security policy Nginx has used for years, ignoring both
    the policy and the developers' position.

- en: Nginx is an incredible software and platform, but I was wondering if it wouldn't
    be time to just bite the bullet and create a more modern solution based on Rust.
    Having a solution that follows a similar model, "understands" the Nginx configuration
    language, and reaches similar performance levels, but with the memory safety and
    wide community adoption of Rust could lead to an amazing new project - perhaps
    even doing to Nginx what Nginx did to Apache HTTP.

  zh: Nginx 是一款令人难以置信的软件和平台，但我在想，现在是不是该认真考虑一下，基于 Rust 创建一个更现代化的解决方案了。有一个类似的模型，能够"理解"
    Nginx 的配置语言，并且达到类似的性能水平，但同时又拥有 Rust 的内存安全性和广泛的社区采用，可能会带来一个令人惊艳的新项目 — 或许甚至可以像 Nginx
    对 Apache HTTP 做的那样，给 Nginx 带来改变。
