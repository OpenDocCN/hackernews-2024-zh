    last year, according to data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration
    (NOAA) and the University of Maine’sClimate Reanalyzer, fueling concerns for marine
    life and extreme weather across the planet.

    in 2023, and now again in 2024, is remarkable,” said Joel Hirschi, associate head
    of marine systems modeling at the National Oceanography Centre in the UK.

    the previous year, said Gregory C. Johnson, a NOAA oceanographer. That rise is
    “is equivalent to about two decades’ worth of warming in a single year,” he told
    CNN. “So it is quite large, quite significant, and a bit surprising.”

    warming](https://www.cnn.com/2024/03/06/climate/hottest-february-climate-copernicus-record-intl/index.html),
    boosted by [El Niño](https://www.cnn.com/2023/07/14/weather/what-is-el-nino-xpn/index.html),
    a natural climate pattern marked by higher-than-average ocean temperatures.

    can add more power to hurricanes and other extreme weather events, including scorching

    Great Barrier Reef is experiencing [its seventh mass bleaching](https://www.cnn.com/2024/03/07/australia/mass-coral-bleaching-event-great-barrier-reef-intl-hnk-scn/index.html)

    tissue and provide their food source. If ocean temperatures remain too high for
    too long, the coral can starve and die.

    a fourth global mass coral bleaching event in the next few months.

    La Niña event develops — El Niño’s counterpart that tends to amplify Atlantic
    hurricane season — “this would increase the risk of a very active hurricane season,”
    Hirschi said.

    fuels is stored in the oceans. “Measuring ocean warming allows us to track the
    status and evolution of planetary warming,” Schuckmann told CNN. “The ocean is
    the sentinel for global warming.”

    over the long term, NOAA’s Johnson said, we should expect them to “continue to
