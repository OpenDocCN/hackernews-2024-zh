    he wants to resume working soon, but I later learned about his death from the
    news.” Sharrouf added, “Mohammed was a very professional journalist. He wanted
    to relay the voices of the people. He worked hard on his pieces and was very keen
    on factual reporting of the daily life of Gaza’s people, despite all the challenges
    that a journalist like him faces. Unfortunately, he was killed before he got to
    do what he wanted in journalism; and the most horrific heartbreaking part was
    that he thought he would survive.”
