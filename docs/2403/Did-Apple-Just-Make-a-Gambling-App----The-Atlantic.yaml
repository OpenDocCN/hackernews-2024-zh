    on TNT, and soon noticed something strange: The scores on the app were *ahead*
    of the telecast. Presumably the game between the Boston Celtics and the Philadelphia

- en: Launched last week, the Apple Sports app is mostly sleek and mostly intuitive,
    as Apple products tend to be. But it’s also something of a misnomer. Apple *Scores*
    would be a better name for the app, because it does almost nothing else. Unlike
    ESPN and the many other major sports apps you can download to track scores and
    follow games, it offers no highlights. There is no news. The app doesn’t even
    show what channel or streaming service the games are airing on. Nor does it show
    the results of any game more than a day ago, or any team’s schedule more than
    a single game in advance. And yet what it *does* show you is betting odds, prominently
    displayed in the home screen.

  zh: 上周推出的苹果体育应用大多流畅且直观，正如苹果产品通常所见。但这个名字也有些误导性。苹果*比分*会是这款应用更合适的名字，因为它几乎没有其他功能。与ESPN及其他众多主要体育应用程序不同，它不提供任何比赛精彩片段。没有新闻，甚至不显示比赛在哪个频道或流媒体服务上播出。这个应用甚至不展示超过一天前的任何比赛结果，或者任何球队超过一场比赛的赛程。然而，它*展示*给你的是博彩赔率，主页上明显显示。

    for the total number of points that will be scored in a game, all provided by
    the sports-betting juggernaut DraftKings. You can hide these details in your iPhone’s
    general settings, and the app doesn’t *link* to DraftKings, where you can actually
    put money down. But this seems to be the crux of the app. It’s the beginning of
    a betting app.

    a die-hard soccer fan, the app is essentially unusable: Along with the MLS, you
    can track the top five European men’s soccer leagues, but not the super-popular
    UEFA Champions League or any matches between national teams. It allows you to
    follow your favorite teams and leagues—if you don’t select any, you’ll see nothing
    when you open the app—but does not include NFL or college football. Though Apple
    has [promised](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2024/02/introducing-apple-sports-a-new-app-for-sports-fans/)

    In 2022, Apple began airing Friday-night Major League Baseball doubleheaders on
    its streaming service, Apple TV+. The following year, it became the exclusive
    broadcaster of Major League Soccer, and now it may be readying a bid of up to
    $2 billion for the rights to Formula 1 racing. And yet the Apple Sports app seems
    ill-equipped to advance its grand sports-streaming ambitions. Though it launched
    the same day as the start of the new MLS season, the app doesn’t even tell you
    that you can watch upcoming games on Apple TV+.

  zh: 同样，它也不是苹果在体育流媒体方面广泛推广的一部分。2022年，苹果开始在其流媒体服务Apple TV+上播放周五晚上的美国职棒大联盟双打比赛。第二年，它成为美国职业足球大联盟的独家转播商，并可能准备以高达20亿美元的价格竞标一级方程式赛车的转播权。然而，苹果体育应用似乎并不具备推动其宏大的体育流媒体野心所需的能力。尽管与新MLS赛季开赛同日推出，但该应用甚至没有告诉你可以在Apple
    TV+上观看即将播出的比赛。
- en: In terms of betting, it makes a lot more sense. What little the app does, it
    does well. It loads extremely fast, and stays constantly up to date. This is a
    marked improvement over, say, the ESPN app, which in my experience refreshes only
    intermittently and is usually a few minutes behind the action. Maybe you don’t
    care much whether your scores app lags by two seconds or two minutes. Otherwise
    you’d probably be watching the game on TV—or, if necessary, secretly streaming
    it on your iPhone under the table. But if what you care about is betting during
    a game, then the difference between a two-second lag and a two-minute lag can
    mean everything. In those two minutes, the star quarterback for the team you’re
    betting on could have thrown an interception or been sidelined with a concussion—information
    you’ll sure wish you had. All of which suggests that Apple Sports is less useful
    as a sports app, or even really a scores app, than as a sort of quasi-betting
    app.

  zh: 从博彩的角度来看，这样做更有意义。尽管该应用功能有限，但表现卓越。加载速度极快，始终保持最新状态。这比例如ESPN应用有了显著改进，根据我的经验，后者只会间歇性地更新，通常比实际情况晚几分钟。也许你并不太在意你的比分应用是否落后了两秒还是两分钟。否则，你可能会在电视上观看比赛，或者必要时在桌下秘密观看iPhone上的直播。但如果你关心的是在比赛过程中进行赌博，那么两秒和两分钟的延迟差异可能就会成为关键。在这两分钟内，你下注的球队的明星四分卫可能已经被抄截或因脑震荡被替换，这些信息你肯定希望知道。所有这些都表明，苹果体育并不像一个真正的体育应用，甚至不像一个纯粹的比分应用，而更像一种准赌博应用。
