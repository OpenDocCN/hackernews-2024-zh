    on TNT, and soon noticed something strange: The scores on the app were *ahead*
    of the telecast. Presumably the game between the Boston Celtics and the Philadelphia
    76ers was appearing on my TV in near-real time, but it was still behind the app’s
    ticking game clock.'

    as Apple products tend to be. But it’s also something of a misnomer. Apple *Scores*
    would be a better name for the app, because it does almost nothing else. Unlike
    ESPN and the many other major sports apps you can download to track scores and
    follow games, it offers no highlights. There is no news. The app doesn’t even
    show what channel or streaming service the games are airing on. Nor does it show
    the results of any game more than a day ago, or any team’s schedule more than
    a single game in advance. And yet what it *does* show you is betting odds, prominently
    displayed in the home screen.

    for the total number of points that will be scored in a game, all provided by
    the sports-betting juggernaut DraftKings. You can hide these details in your iPhone’s
    general settings, and the app doesn’t *link* to DraftKings, where you can actually
    put money down. But this seems to be the crux of the app. It’s the beginning of
    a betting app.

    rationalize the app’s purpose in any other way. If you look at Apple Sports as
    an ESPN competitor, it pales in comparison. No news? No highlights? If you are
    a die-hard soccer fan, the app is essentially unusable: Along with the MLS, you
    can track the top five European men’s soccer leagues, but not the super-popular
    UEFA Champions League or any matches between national teams. It allows you to
    follow your favorite teams and leagues—if you don’t select any, you’ll see nothing
    when you open the app—but does not include NFL or college football. Though Apple
    has [promised](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2024/02/introducing-apple-sports-a-new-app-for-sports-fans/)
    that these will be available by the start of their respective seasons, it has
    made no such promises about tennis or golf, which the app doesn’t include either.'

    In 2022, Apple began airing Friday-night Major League Baseball doubleheaders on
    its streaming service, Apple TV+. The following year, it became the exclusive
    broadcaster of Major League Soccer, and now it may be readying a bid of up to
    $2 billion for the rights to Formula 1 racing. And yet the Apple Sports app seems
    ill-equipped to advance its grand sports-streaming ambitions. Though it launched
    the same day as the start of the new MLS season, the app doesn’t even tell you
    that you can watch upcoming games on Apple TV+.

    does well. It loads extremely fast, and stays constantly up to date. This is a
    marked improvement over, say, the ESPN app, which in my experience refreshes only
    intermittently and is usually a few minutes behind the action. Maybe you don’t
    care much whether your scores app lags by two seconds or two minutes. Otherwise
    you’d probably be watching the game on TV—or, if necessary, secretly streaming
    it on your iPhone under the table. But if what you care about is betting during
    a game, then the difference between a two-second lag and a two-minute lag can
    mean everything. In those two minutes, the star quarterback for the team you’re
    betting on could have thrown an interception or been sidelined with a concussion—information
    you’ll sure wish you had. All of which suggests that Apple Sports is less useful
    as a sports app, or even really a scores app, than as a sort of quasi-betting
    app.

    hasn’t ruled out allowing users to click through to DraftKings or some other sportsbook.
    “Whether we let you tap on it to go to DraftKings or not … we’ll decide that later,”
    Eddy Cue, the Apple executive [leading](https://www.gq.com/story/apple-sports-streaming-mls-eddy-cue)
    the sports push, [told CNET](https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/apples-new-sports-app-focuses-on-scores-stats-and-speed/)

    has traditionally been pretty averse to anything that could be construed as a
    vice. Its extensive [rules](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/)
    prohibit apps that encourage the use of “tobacco and vape products, illegal drugs,

    on showing betting odds in the Apple Sports app,” Joe Rossignol, a senior reporter
    for MacRumors who has covered Apple since 2008, told me via email. “Even nowadays,
    however, I don’t see Apple ever allowing users to place wagers directly in the
    app.” It just doesn’t seem to align with the spirit of the company.

    *America* no longer sees it as a vice. Only in 2018 did the Supreme Court let

    regularly discuss betting lines, throwing around lingo about “parlays” and “prop

    would be the final confirmation of gambling’s acceptance into mainstream American
    culture, and a move that would mainstream gambling even more. Apple Sports, despite
    such limited functionality, is already high on the App Store charts. It could
    become a default, like the weather app or the camera app, potentially putting
    sports betting a touch-screen tap away from the world’s [1.5 billion](https://www.demandsage.com/iphone-user-statistics/#:~:text=There%20are%20more%20than%201.46,by%20the%20end%20of%202024.)

    have imagined in 2018, would grow bigger still than almost anyone can imagine
    now.
