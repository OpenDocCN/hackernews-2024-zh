    to livestreaming platforms has been developed based on an analytical framework
    that responds to the combination of different observable attributes (posture,
    clothing, image focus, etc.) with which to measure the frequency and intensity
    in which streamers sexualize themselves, as well as their context and behavior

    10 videos were selected from the daily world ranking within the selected categories

    with the same amount of clothing in different channels, for example, the analysis
    of context and behavior gives us a different view of the degree of sexualization.
    In this context, a streamer wearing a swimsuit sunbathing on the beach would receive
    7 points and fall within the sexualized or moderately intense category. Meanwhile,
    another streamer, also in a swimsuit but adopting a more seductive pose (tilting
    the hips suggestively) and simulating a sexual act such as licking an ice cream
    cone or a microphone, would score 12 points and be categorized as sexualized.
    Therefore, measuring both context and the behavior allows us to show the intensity

- en: The data extracted from this analysis was recorded and processed with SPSS 29.0\.
    The factorial structure was studied through Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA)
    supported by the Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin (KMO) index and Bartlett’s sphericity test.
    To decide on item retention, anti-image correlations were examined. Furthermore,
    total explained variance was analyzed to determine the number of components. Finding
    the rotated solution, an analysis of internal consistency is conducted through
    the Cronbach’s Alpha reliability coefficient for each dimension that comprises
    the scale. Finally, the scale is presented with its respective dimensions, variables,
    and conceptualizations. Categorical variables were presented through cross tables
    and frequency distributions. In order to test whether there are significant differences
    in the degree of sexualization depending on the gender of the streamer, as well
    as in the aspects of context and behavior according to the *Twitch.tv* category,
    chi-square tests of sample homogeneity were performed.
