    not the only one who has noticed](https://mashable.com/article/google-search-low-quality-research
    "(opens in a new window)"). Recently, for example, I searched for a Lifehacker
    post that included the word kelvin, which is not exactly a common term. Instead
    of pulling up the few articles that mentioned it (including [the Connections column](https://lifehacker.com/entertainment/nyt-connections-answer-today-march-2-2024)
    I was looking for), Google decided I would be happy to see results including “K,”
    the scientific abbreviation for the temperature unit. And so it gave me a results
    page full of articles about how to save money in a 401(k) account.

    only lay *part* of the blame on the results being cluttered with AI-generated
    junk and human-generated SEO-bait. I don’t have a fix for what people (and bots)
    are writing, nor can I reach into Google’s ranking algorithm and shuffle the pages
    around. But I *can* tell you how to get Google to actually search for the thing
    you typed in.

    by searching for words that are similar to those you are searching for (and, more
    cynically, they may try to be helpful to advertisers by funneling your interests
    into things that advertisers want to sell you). Much of the time this is useful;
    for example, a search for the plural “running shoes” will also turn up pages that
    name a “running shoe” in the singular.'

    searches like the one I mentioned above, where I’m looking for a temperature unit
    and I get advice on retirement funds. There used to be an easy fix: You’d put
    your word in quotes. That’s been less reliable lately (although sometimes it seems
    to still work).'

    recently, given the ever-broadening adjustments Google makes to our search queries.
