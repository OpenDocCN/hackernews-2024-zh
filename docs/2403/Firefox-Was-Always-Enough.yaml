    It was noted that a founder has a special place and ability as a leader. We never
    got to find out, but there was some sense to it: a founder has particular authority,
    without getting that authority through consensus-building. If you bring in a decisive
    outsider they will probably fail, lacking the authority (and probably the wisdom)
