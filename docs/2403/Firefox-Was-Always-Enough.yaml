    years; I believe in Mozilla and want the project to succeed.

    success, and the reason Mozilla still exists.

    layoffs that were otherwise inevitable.'

    It was noted that a founder has a special place and ability as a leader. We never
    got to find out, but there was some sense to it: a founder has particular authority,
    without getting that authority through consensus-building. If you bring in a decisive
    outsider they will probably fail, lacking the authority (and probably the wisdom)
    to guide the company. If you bring in or promote someone appropriate for a more
    mature company, then the company may be operated well but the choices made will
    be more conservative.'

    maintain privacy, expand the web platform, make technology more widely accessible,
    give people autonomy, anonymity, security. Or a standard can work against all
    those principles.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    many devices that aren’t even browsers. So if Mozilla can positively affect these
    standards it can benefit everyone.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One good way to get a seat at the table is to be an important implementor. Standards
    are sometimes created with no implementations, but these usually don’t go anywhere.
    With that lesson learned, browser implementors have a lot of weight, both about
    how things are standardized and where attention is directed.

    more. (See [Servo](https://servo.org/))'
  prefs: []

    host even more of them, it should host mobile applications, it should be the universal
    platform. More APIs. More ways to package and present sites. (See [Project Fugu](https://www.chromium.org/teams/web-capabilities-fugu))'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    less terrible. We need better privacy. Better security. More process isolation,
    more sandboxing. Less APIs and more restrictions on those APIs. (See [Unfck the
    Internet](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/unfck/) or [Brave](https://brave.com/))'

    remember history, manage navigation, get us back to where we want to go. It’s
    an information tool. Browser should have better tab and task management, easier
    recall, tools to capture and move information. (See new browsers like [Vivaldi](https://vivaldi.com/),
    [Shift](https://tryshift.com/), and up and coming things like [[Amna](https://www.getamna.com/)

  prefs: []

    in [Firefox OS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefox_OS)). But Firefox was frankly
    underwater quantitatively, and [Quantum](https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2017/11/14/introducing-firefox-quantum/)
    represented a bit of a pivot to *quantitative improvement*. Now it’s focused on
    *technological pessimism* in the form of a security and privacy emphasis.
