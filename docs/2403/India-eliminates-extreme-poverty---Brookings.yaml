    for 2022-23, providing the first official survey-based poverty estimates for India
    in over ten years. The previous official survey was conducted from 2011-12, and
    the absence of up-to-date data for India has added considerable uncertainty to
    global poverty headcount ratios.

- en: 'Before presenting the results, a quick methodological note is in order. India
    has two different methods for estimating consumption expenditures: the Uniform
    Recall Period (URP) and the more accurate Modified Mixed Recall Period (MMRP).
    The URP method asks households questions on their consumption expenditures over
    a uniform recall period of 30 days. The MMRP asks household consumer expenditure
    on perishables (for example, fruits, vegetables, eggs) for the last 7 days, durable
    goods for the last 365 days, and expenditure on all other items for the last 30
    days. India officially shifted to the MMRP, the standard in other countries, beginning
    with the 2022-23 survey, though it previously experimented with both methods.'

    to 2011-12 using the URP method and from 2011-12 to 2022-23 using the MMRP method
    for the purchasing power parity (PPP)$ 1.9 (international extreme poverty) and
    PPP$ 3.2 poverty lines (recommended line by the World Bank for lower middle-income
    countries such as India).

    poverty in India for the PPP$ 1.9 poverty line. (Here we use the PPP$ 1.9 line
    [2011 prices] rather than the PPP$ 2.15 line at 2017 prices because the former
    closely corresponds to the official India Tendulkar poverty line.) The Headcount
    Poverty Ratio (HCR) for the 2011 PPP$ 1.9 poverty line has declined from 12.2
    per cent in 2011-12 to 2 per cent in 2022-23, equivalent to 0.93 percentage points
    (ppt) per year. Rural poverty stood at 2.5% while urban poverty was down to 1%.
    For the PPP$ 3.2 line, HCR declined from 53.6% to 20.8% (almost 3 ppt per year).
    Note that these estimates do not take into account the free food (wheat and rice)
    supplied by the government to approximately two-thirds of the population, nor
    utilization of public health and education.'

    than those estimated by the World Bank. That institution relied on the Consumer
    Pyramids Household Survey, a privately provided data source, to derive poverty
    numbers of 10% (at $1.90) and 45% (at $3.20) in 2020, despite well-known problems
    with that data explained by [Bhalla, Bhasin and Virmani (2022)](https://www.elibrary.imf.org/view/journals/001/2022/069/article-A001-en.xml).

    to transition to a higher poverty line in an earlier [article](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/raising-the-standard-time-for-a-higher-poverty-line-in-india/).
    The decline in HCR for both the poverty lines illustrates this point, as we can
    see not much decline can occur at the lower poverty line. Incidentally, the decline
    in HCR at the higher poverty line is remarkable given that in the past it took
    30 years for India to witness a similar decline in poverty levels as now witnessed
    over 11 years.

- en: The relatively higher consumption growth in rural areas should not come as a
    surprise given the strong policy thrust on redistribution through a wide variety
    of publicly funded programs. These include a national mission for construction
    of toilets and attempts to ensure universal access to electricity, modern cooking
    fuel, and more recently, piped water. As an example, [rural access](https://ejalshakti.gov.in/jjmreport/JJMIndia.aspx)
    to piped water in India as of 15^(th) August 2019 was 16.8%  and at present it
    is 74.7%. The reduced sickness from accessing safe water may have helped families
    earn more income. Similarly, under the [Aspirational District Program](https://www.niti.gov.in/aspirational-districts-programme),
    112 districts of the country were identified as having the lowest development
    indicators. These districts were targeted by government policies with an explicit
    focus on improving their performance in development.

- en: Official data now confirms that India has eliminated extreme poverty, as commonly
    defined in international comparisons. This is an encouraging development with
    positive implications for global poverty headcount rates. This also means that
    time has come for India to graduate to a higher poverty line much like other countries.
    The transition to a higher poverty line provides an opportunity to redefine existing
    social protection programs particularly with the objective of better identification
    of intended beneficiaries and providing greater support to the genuine poor.
