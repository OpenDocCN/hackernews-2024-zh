    above Mach 5, along a relatively shallow, atmospheric flight path to its target.
    The vehicle is also designed to be maneuverable, giving it the ability to erratically
    change course. The result is a weapon that presents particular challenges for
    opponents both in terms of any intercept attempts and just trying to otherwise
    react to the incoming threat by trying to relocate assets or seeking cover.

    would shift to its [Hypersonic Attack Cruise Missile](https://www.twz.com/darpas-hypersonic-cruise-missile-flew-its-final-test-follow-on-to-come)
    (HACM) program. ARRW had previously been expected to be the first operational
    U.S. hypersonic weapon, but years of flight testing, including multiple end-to-end
    live-fire launches, had produced decidedly mixed results.

    past that it views the acquisition of air-launched hypersonic missiles of some
    kind as a key component of its future plans. At the same time, hypersonic weapons
    are also expected to be extremely expensive. A report from the Congressional Budget
    Office (CBO) published in January 2023 estimated that the average unit price for
    ARRW could be between $14.9 and $17.5 million. For comparison, a single current-generation
    Tomahawk land attack cruise costs around $2.5 million, according [to U.S. military
    budget documents](https://comptroller.defense.gov/Budget-Materials/).
