- en: What else besides authenticity predicts relationship satisfaction? A 2016 paper
    in Evolution and Human Behavior, authored by Daniel Conroy-Beam, Cari D. Goetz,
    and David Buss explored what makes people happy in their relationships. They discovered
    that people were less satisfied in relationships when their partners were less
    desirable compared to other potential choices. However, this was specifically
    the case for individuals who were more attractive than their partners. That is,
    people were satisfied with mates who were either more attractive than themselves,
    or more attractive than alternative choices. In short, when people were with partners
    who were attractive and hard to replace, then they were more likely to be satisfied.
    It seems that people aren’t asking themselves, “Does my partner fulfill my relationship
    needs?” Rather, they ask “Is my partner better than the realistic alternatives?”

    as the 37% rule, or “the secretary problem.”Suppose you’re looking for the best
    candidate for a secretary position (or any other job). The rule says that you
    should estimate how many total applicants are likely to seek the position, interview
    the first 37 percent of them, and remember the best out of that initial sample.
    Then, continue interviewing until you find a candidate who is even better than

    until you find someone more compatible than the best in that batch. However, researchers
    have [found](https://www.psychologytoday.com/sites/default/files/attachments/95822/mate-choice-turns-cognitive.pdf)
    that a similar rule called “Try a Dozen” can work just as well as the 37% rule.
    According to this simpler approach, you would date a dozen possible romantic partners,
    remember the best of them, and then pick the very next prospect who is even more

    For appearance, keep up on personal grooming and hygiene; improve your health

  zh: 在他的书 *《门卫：承诺的战术指南》* 中，心理学家肖恩·T·史密斯提供了几个要注意的特征。以下是一些重要的特征：
- en: ·  Shifting responsibility for managing emotions. Rather than speak directly
    about their own sadness or anger, someone might redirect the conversation onto
    their partners by saying things like “Why did you need to do that?” Or “Only someone
    with problems would say it that way.” These ad hominem attacks imply that they
    are not responsible for their own feelings, and that you are to blame for managing
    their emotions. Relatedly, David Buss has suggested that one desirable feature
    for any potential mate is how quickly they return to their emotional baseline.
    That is, if your partner is angry or upset with you, do they take a long time
    to settle down? Do their negative emotions take a long time to subside? This is
    a key marker of emotional stability (neuroticism). Low emotional stability (high
    neuroticism) is consistently associated with increased [conflict](https://labs.la.utexas.edu/buss/files/2015/09/conflict_in_married_couples_1991_j_of_p.pdf),
    marital [dissatisfaction](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1987-15348-001), and
    risk of divorce.

  zh: ·  转移管理情绪的责任。某人可能不直接谈论自己的悲伤或愤怒，而是通过这样的话题将对话转向他们的伴侣：“你为什么要那样做？”或“只有有问题的人才会那样说。”
    这些人身攻击暗示他们对自己的感受不负责任，并且你要为管理他们的情绪负责。相关地，大卫·巴斯（David Buss）建议，任何潜在伴侣的一个理想特征是他们多快能回到他们的情感基线。也就是说，如果你的伴侣对你生气或不满，他们会花很长时间平静下来吗？他们的负面情绪会很长时间消退吗？这是情感稳定性（神经质）的一个关键标志。情感稳定性低（神经质高）与增加的[冲突](https://labs.la.utexas.edu/buss/files/2015/09/conflict_in_married_couples_1991_j_of_p.pdf)，婚姻[不满意](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1987-15348-001)，和离婚风险持续相关。
- en: ·  Forcing you to play the guessing game. Instead of stating their needs outright,
    someone might say, “If you cared about me, you would know what I need.” This puts
    you in a state of constant uncertainty, a recipe for an unhappy relationship.
    In fact, personally, I would recommend a policy of overcommunication. For uncertainties
    and ambiguities, try to cultivate a rule where both you and your partner err on
    the side of saying more than you think is necessary, to the point where you and
    your partner say things to each other that seem perfectly obvious. This can save
    a lot of heartache.

  zh: ·  迫使你玩猜谜游戏。有人可能不直接陈述他们的需求，而是说：“如果你关心我，你就会知道我需要什么。” 这让你处于持续不确定状态，这是一段不幸福关系的典型表现。事实上，个人建议采取过度沟通的策略。对于不确定和模糊之处，试着培养一个规则，你和你的伴侣都多说一些你们认为不必要的话，直到你们相互之间说的东西显得非常明显为止。这可以避免很多心痛。
- en: ·  Character assault. Statements like “You always do that” or “You never listen”
    indicate an undeveloped personality and suggest that the person is unwilling to
    bear any share of responsibility for conflicts that arise.

    that anger evolved in order to bargain for better treatment. It can be expressed
    in one of two ways. First, inflicting costs, which can entail verbal or physical
    abuse. Second, anger can be expressed by withholding benefits which can entail
    tactics like the silent treatment. Both are intended to manipulate the target’s
    behavior. However, we have rightly developed a norm against overt anger expressions
    (inflicting costs). Such a norm would also be helpful for covert anger expressions
    as well (withholding benefits). Healthy communication rather than yelling or snubbing
    is a better approach.

  zh: ·  沉默对待。进化心理学研究[suggests](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.0904312106)愤怒进化是为了要求更好的待遇。它可以通过两种方式表达。首先，造成成本，这可能涉及言语或身体上的伤害。其次，愤怒可以通过拒绝提供好处来表达，这可能包括沉默对待等策略。这两者都旨在操控目标的行为。然而，我们正确地对公开愤怒表达（造成成本）发展了规范。对于隐蔽的愤怒表达同样有帮助。健康的沟通而不是大声喊叫或冷落是更好的方法。
- en: Smith offers a quote in another of his books, *The Tactical Guide to Women*,
    “Look for the red flags early in the relationship. If anything pops up early on,
    don’t let that slide. Most people are on their best behavior in the beginning.
    They hide it well until around the six-month mark. For example, if she gets drunk
    and is screaming at you for no reason within the first month, run as fast as you
    can. Don’t let something like that slide. There are underlying issues there.”
    This doesn’t mean that they are a bad person or unworthy of love or anything like
    that. But drinking and yelling is a sign that such a person might not be ideal
    for a long-term relationship commitment.

  zh: Smith在他的另一本书《The Tactical Guide to Women》中提到了一句话：“在关系初期，要注意红旗。如果有任何问题在初期就显现出来，不要视而不见。大多数人在开始阶段表现得很好。他们可以隐藏得很好，直到六个月左右。比如，如果她在第一个月就喝醉了，无缘无故地对你大喊大叫，那就尽快逃离。不要忽视这种情况。这里面有潜在的问题。”
    这并不意味着他们是坏人或者不值得爱之类的。但是喝酒和大声喊叫可能表明这样的人可能不适合长期的关系承诺。

- en: Anybody can communicate well when they and the relationship are at their best.
    Clarity, though, encompasses *reliable* communication and the ability to communicate
    during stormy periods. If a partner’s skills are unreliable, they may revert to
    more primitive means of self-expression, such as passive-aggressiveness and outbursts.
    Good relationships require that both partners express themselves constructively,
    *especially* during times of stress.

- en: Relatedly, inquisitiveness is an important skill. It cuts through ambiguities
    and insecurities. Within a relationship, if one person behaves in an insensitive
    manner, a sign of inquisitiveness would be if his or her partner, rather than
    expressing anger, calmly asks why and listens. This can open the path to communication
    and understanding, rather than mutually escalating hostilities. As Smith puts
    it, “The inquisitive person places facts and reality above emotion. Emotions still
    exist, they’re just not in the driver’s seat.” Inquisitiveness works when both
    individuals try to understand the other person, rather than make assumptions based
    on limited information.

  zh: 相关地，好奇心是一种重要的技能。它可以消除模糊和不安全感。在一段关系中，如果一个人表现出不敏感的行为，好奇心的一个表现就是如果他或她的伴侣，而不是表达愤怒，平静地询问为什么并倾听。这可以打开沟通和理解的道路，而不是相互升级敌意。正如Smith所说，“好奇心的人把事实和现实放在情绪之上。情绪仍然存在，只是不掌控局面。”
    好奇心在双方都试图理解对方而不是基于有限信息做假设时发挥作用。
- en: 'Emotional maturity is another green flag. Some signs of this skill: She can
    calm herself when she’s sad or angry, she accepts reality, she keeps commitments,
    she takes care of relationships and doesn’t burn bridges, she bases important
    decisions on values rather than impulse, and she possesses the emotional resources
    to function well among coworkers, family, and friends.'

- en: Stability, another positive quality, indicates that a woman handles her personal
    challenges and cares for herself so that her life (and yours) isn’t a series of
    crises. As Smith puts it, a woman “who is unwilling to strive for her best state

    “a unique relationship that ordinarily includes loving, romantic, tender, and

    in turn experiences her partner as a “special man.” The special woman is someone
    who “generates and supports his heroic strivings” and “joins him on his journey”
