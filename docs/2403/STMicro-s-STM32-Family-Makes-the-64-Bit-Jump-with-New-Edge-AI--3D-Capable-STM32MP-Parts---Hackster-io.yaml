- en: STMicroelectronics has announced its second-generation STM32 microprocessors,
    promising improved performance and acceleration for edge artificial intelligence
    (AI) and machine learning workloads ‚Äî and a move to 64-bit processors cores for
    the first time in the range's history.

    demands to smart devices, often deployed at the IoT [Internet of Things] edge,
    for faster response and increased efficiency," says STMicro''s Stephane Henry
    of the company''s new processors.'

    despite retaining the STM32 name. The STM32MP2 chips are the company''s first
    to use the Arm Cortex-A35 core, running at speeds of up to 1.5GHz, alongside a
    32-bit Arm Cortex-M33 microcontroller core running at up to 400MHz, a dedicated
    graphics processing unit (GPU) with 3D acceleration and support for 1080p displays,
    a video processing unit (VPU), and a neural processing unit (NPU) designed to
    accelerate on-device edge AI and machine learning work.'

    (TOPS) of compute, with workloads able to run on the Cortex-A35, Cortex-M33, GPU,
    VPU, or NPU cores as-required. It''s not present in all models, however: only
    the STM32MP257, STM32MP255, and STM32MP23x chips include the AI co-processor and
    3D GPU; the remainder of the range stick with one or two Cortex-A35 cores and

    says the chips can run 24 hours a day for 10 years, with a junction temperature
    rated at -40¬∞C to 125¬∞C (-40¬∞F to 257¬∞F). The new parts also come with the promise

    the use of a two-port switch, support for Time Sensitive Networking (TSN), PCI
    Express Gen. 2, USB 3.0, and up to three CAN-FD buses, RGB, LVDS, and MIPI Display
    Serial Interface (DSI) video outputs with H.264 video acceleration on the GPU-equipped
    models, and a MIPI Camera Serial Interface 2 (CSI-2) input with image signal processor.

    take orders: the parts are due to enter volume production in June this year, with
    a development board to follow in due course. More information is available [on
