    to securing the software supply chain — a vision we at Chainguard share and that
    our new partnership with Docker advances. The DVP program provides trusted content
    to Docker customers and users, allowing development teams to build securely and
    minimize access to malicious software.

    Hub. Starting today, I''d estimate my Docker runs are now 70% more efficient,”
    said Darren Shepherd, Co Founder and Chief Architect, Acorn. “Seriously though,
    this is something I''ve been asking Chainguard about for a while and I''m glad
    to see the day has come. I can only hope the next critical innovation that happens
    is adding Wolfi into the library namespace."**'
