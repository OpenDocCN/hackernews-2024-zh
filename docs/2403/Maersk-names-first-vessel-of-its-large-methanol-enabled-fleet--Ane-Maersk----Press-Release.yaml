    vessel has been named "Ane Mærsk" at a ceremony in the shipyard of HD Hyundai
    Heavy Industries (HD HHI) in Ulsan, South Korea. The vessel is named after Ane
    Mærsk Mc-Kinney Uggla, the Chair of the A.P. Moller Foundation and A.P. Moller
    Holding. Ane’s eldest granddaughter served as godmother and christened the vessel
    by breaking a champagne bottle over the bow.'

    will be delivered between 2024 and 2025\. It is the world’s second methanol-enabled
    container vessel. In the beginning of February, it will enter service on the AE7
    string connecting Asia and Europe, marking a significant milestone in the company’s
    commitment to pioneering low-emissions shipping solutions. The vessels in the
    new series have an industry-first innovative design with the bridge and accommodation
    placed at the very front of the vessel, which ensures fuel efficient operations.

    their life cycle compared to fossil fuels. Different green fuels achieve different
    life cycle reductions depending on their production pathway. By 'low' we refer
    to fuels with 65-80% life cycle GHG reductions compared to fossil fuels. This
    covers, e.g., some biodiesels. ”Very low” refers to fuels with 80-95% life cycle
    GHG reductions compared to fossil fuels.
