    for the first weekend of the N.C.A.A. basketball tournament. Memory often fails
    when it comes to gambling, but I believe the only year we’ve skipped was 2020,
    when *COVID*-19 shut down the tournament a week or so before the scheduled tipoff.
    March Madness in Vegas isn’t a pretty scene—picture hundreds of red-faced, middle-aged
    men in quarter-zip sweatshirts hugging Coors Lights to their chests in a slightly
    self-conscious way—but the first round has thirty-two games to bet on, and tradition
    is tradition, I guess.

    to forty-five-minute line for the betting window at the Venetian sports book.
    Today, most of those windows, which used to house dour tellers who would print
    out your bets on little tickets, have been replaced by automated kiosks, which
    provide you with a wider variety of bets than their analog counterparts but make
    the whole experience feel frictionless and disposable. These machines are run
    by casino companies, many of which have their own apps, which means that, if you

    wagering is now legal, you could have replicated this particular Vegas experience

    for gambling offenses, most notably Calvin Ridley, who was suspended for a full
    season for betting on N.F.L. games while he was injured and away from his team.
    Last summer, a college baseball coach was accused of giving information about
    an upcoming game to a gambler, and was subsequently fired. Earlier this month,
    a gambling watchdog company called U.S. Integrity flagged a college basketball
    game between Temple University and the University of Alabama at Birmingham for
    suspicious betting activity; *Sports Illustrated* [reported](https://www.si.com/college/2024/03/08/gambling-watchdog-alerts-unusual-wagering-activity-on-temple-mens-basketball-games)

    concern about the speed and the gamification of the new betting apps. But, at
    the time, I was skeptical that broad legalization would lead to, as I put it then,
    a “long-term epidemic of problem gambling.” As for cheating scandals, if Romans
    were gambling at the Colosseum, some hustler was probably out there trying to
    convince a gladiator to throw a fight. And, though there were more improprieties
    after legalization than there had been before, the scale and the salaciousness
    of these scandals didn’t compare to the decades of match-fixing that we’ve seen
    in Europe and Asia.

    spread of legal sports betting across the country has revealed problems that can’t
    easily be brushed aside or cloaked in minimizing context. The question for lawmakers

    —— 它们确实存在 —— 而是这些问题是合法体育博彩的永久特征，还是会在最初的狂热过后逐渐消退。
- en: The legalizations of vices can be followed by gleeful oversaturation, and that
    period of chaos and moral myopia may obscure what is good about letting people

    dimming the promise of legal weed as a well-regulated, tax-generating industry.
    This doesn’t prove that marijuana should have remained illegal or that the arguments
    for legalization are invalid. What it means is that New York screwed up and should
    enforce its own laws. You can make a similar point about the sale of high-dosage
    THC edibles that are packaged to look like candy. There’s no need to ban [edibles](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/the-cannabis-edible-goes-mainstream).

- en: When it comes to sports betting, there are at least two legitimate worries,
    although it’s still difficult to know exactly how persistent these concerns will
    be. The first is that the ubiquity, speed, and structure of app-based betting—which
    favors high-risk, high-reward “parlays” that combine multiple bets—will create
    an enormous population of young gambling addicts. I remain largely unconvinced
    of this. Most people aren’t problem gamblers, just as most people can navigate
    a world of beer ads without becoming alcoholics.

  zh: 谈到体育赌博，至少有两个合理的担忧，尽管目前仍然很难准确知道这些问题会持续多久。第一个是基于应用程序的赌博的普遍性、速度和结构——这种结构更偏向于高风险、高回报的“串联赌注”，将会造成大量年轻赌徒的出现。我在很大程度上并不认同这一观点。大多数人并不是问题赌徒，就像大多数人可以在充斥着啤酒广告的世界中生活而不成为酗酒者一样。
- en: The second worry is more abstract, but also, I think, more substantiated. It
    involves what commentators like to call the “integrity of the game,” and professional
    sports leagues aggressively partnering with betting companies, which are currently
    blitzing the country with a seemingly endless marketing budget. Last week, for
    example, the N.B.A. announced that it would add in-game betting to its popular
    League Pass streaming app. This means that a viewer could watch nearly any N.B.A.
    game on any given night and bet, say, ten dollars that LeBron James was going
    to miss his first free throw. Maybe James hits it, and the viewer doubles down
    on James’s next one; perhaps, having lost some money in the first half, the viewer
    tries to win it back in the second.

  zh: 第二个担忧更为抽象，但我认为也更为实质。这涉及到评论员们喜欢称之为“游戏的完整性”，以及专业体育联盟与赌博公司紧密合作。这些公司目前正在全国范围内大肆推广，广告预算似乎无穷无尽。例如，上周NBA宣布将在其热门的League
    Pass流媒体应用中增加赛中投注功能。这意味着观众几乎可以在任何晚上观看几乎任何一场NBA比赛，并下注，比如说，押注10美元詹姆斯会错过他的第一个罚球。也许詹姆斯投中了，观众接着下注他的下一个罚球；也许，在上半场输了一些钱后，观众试图在下半场赢回来。
- en: Not long ago, if someone told me that they were troubled by this sort of thing,
    I would have said that the integrity of the game had been undone long ago by exploitative
    labor conditions in college sports and by a slew of non-gambling scandals in the
    pro leagues. I would have noted that N.F.L. broadcasts have been revolving beer
    ads since I was a child, and pointed out that soccer teams in England have had
    conspicuous betting-company logos on their uniforms for years. How did this latest

- en: Now I think that legal betting really is changing how people experience sports,
    in part because of the way sports are now broadcast to them. Gamblers sometimes
    forget how many people, including children, still watch the games for something
    other than parlays and prop bets, or that teams, such as the Yankees, the Cowboys,
    and the Crimson Tide, really do represent more than their business concerns. When
    every game gets presented as a point spread, and when every shot becomes merely
    an input in a degenerate’s parlay math, the game feels cheapened. For someone
    who wants to watch the best athletes in the world compete against one another,
    it can be alienating to listen to the announcer read stilted ad copy about the
    upcoming slate of same-game parlays.

- en: And there’s a much more concerning subset of the integrity problem, one that
    feels more permanent and specific to the style and ubiquity of online gambling.
    Sports betting may be a trenchant vice, but the bets themselves have changed dramatically.
    Single-game parlays, or S.G.P.s, in which a bettor strings together multiple wagers
    on individual statistical outcomes—how many points, rebounds, turnovers a certain
    player will accumulate—for potentially lottery-like payouts, have exploded in
    popularity. These bets are far more profitable for the books. According to a [study](https://gaming.library.unlv.edu/reports/NV_sportsbetting.pdf)
    by the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, a typical bet on whether a team will cover
    the spread will deliver a five- or six-per-cent return for the casino. An S.G.P.,
    by comparison, will typically return up to thirty per cent. As a result, nearly
    every sports-betting company relentlessly pushes S.G.P.s, which, in turn, has
    led to a greater focus on individual players. It’s not that easy to fix a basketball
    game—you have nine other guys on the court affecting the outcome, not to mention
    the coaches and the officials. It’s a lot easier to fix your own performance.
    You just have to grab an extra rebound away from a teammate or maybe kick the
    ball out of bounds at the end of a blowout, and the odds will be ever in your
    favor.

  zh: 在完整性问题中，有一个更令人担忧的子集，它感觉更加永久，更具体于在线赌博的风格和普及性。体育博彩可能是一个尖锐的恶习，但下注本身发生了巨大变化。单场滚球串联（S.G.P.s），即赌徒将多个赌注串联在一起，涉及个体统计结果——某位球员会积累多少分、篮板和失误，可能会带来类似彩票的高额回报，这在流行中迅速蔓延。这些赌注对书籍来说利润更高。根据内华达大学拉斯维加斯分校的一项[研究](https://gaming.library.unlv.edu/reports/NV_sportsbetting.pdf)，对于一般是否能够打破盘口的赌注，赌场可能会获得百分之五到六的回报。相比之下，单场滚球串联的回报通常可达三十个百分点。因此，几乎每家体育博彩公司都在不断推广S.G.P.s，进而导致更多关注个体球员。调整篮球比赛并不容易——你在场上有其他九名队友影响结果，更不用说教练和裁判了。调整自己的表现要容易得多。你只需从队友那里抢到额外的篮板，或者在比分悬殊时将球踢出界，胜算就永远在你这边。
