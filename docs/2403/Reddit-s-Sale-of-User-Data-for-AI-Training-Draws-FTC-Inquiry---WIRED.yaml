    that Reddit has been pitching to investors as it seeks to drum up interest for
    shares being sold in its IPO. Reddit CEO Steve Huffman in the investor pitch described
    the company’s data as invaluable. “We expect our data advantage and intellectual
    property to continue to be a key element in the training of future” AI systems,
    he wrote.

    last month about the Reddit AI deal, Google vice president Rajan Patel said tapping
    the service’s data would provide valuable new information, without being specific
    about its uses. “Google will now have efficient and structured access to fresher
    information, as well as enhanced signals that will help us better understand Reddit
    content and display, train on, and otherwise use it in the most accurate and relevant
    ways,” Patel wrote.

- en: The FTC had previously shown concern about how data gets passed around in the
    AI market. In January, the agency announced it was requesting information from
    Microsoft and its partner and ChatGPT developer OpenAI about their multibillion-dollar
    relationship. Amazon, Google, and AI chatbot maker Anthropic were also questioned
    about their own partnerships, the FTC said. The agency’s chair, Lina Khan, described
    its concern as being whether the partnerships between big companies and upstarts
    would lead to unfair competition.

    to help them understand what people are saying about them online. Researchers
    and software developers have used Reddit data to study online behavior and build
    add-ons for the platform. More recently, Reddit has contemplated selling data
    to help algorithmic traders looking for an edge on Wall Street.

- en: Licensing for AI-related purposes is a newer line of business, one Reddit launched
    after it became clear that the conversations it hosts helped train up the AI models
    behind chatbots including ChatGPT and Gemini. Reddit last July introduced fees
    for large-scale access to user posts and comments, saying its content should not
    be plundered for free.

    add ons for reading or enhancing Reddit. Some users staged a rebellion, shutting
    down parts of Reddit for days. The potential for further user protests had been
    one of the main risks the company disclosed to potential investors ahead of its
    trading debut expected next Thursday—until the FTC letter arrived.
