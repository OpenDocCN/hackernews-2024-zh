    needs to be plugged into my phone’s charger. Whenever I need to charge my phone,
    I unplug the server and plug in my phone. It takes up so little space that I *literally
    leave it on my night stand*.

    of issues over SSH and took a while to figure out, since servers usually don’t
    suspend.

    set it up in less than five minutes if she needed to.
