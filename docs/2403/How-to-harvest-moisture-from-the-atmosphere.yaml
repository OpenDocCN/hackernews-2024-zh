- en: Even in the most speculative reaches of science fiction, there is no escaping
    humanity’s dependence on liquid water. Luke Skywalker, the hero of the original
    “Star Wars” trilogy, grows up on his uncle’s moisture farm, extracting water from
    Tatooine’s arid atmosphere. The residents of the desert world Arrakis, accessible
    to anyone with a copy of Frank Herbert’s novel “Dune” (or with three hours to
    kill at their nearest cinema), likewise use windtraps to steal precious liquid
    from the air.

- en: Engineers on Earth, too, are increasingly looking to the atmosphere for water.
    They have good reason to do so. Even in the depths of Chile’s Atacama Desert,
    often called the driest place on Earth, estimates suggest that fog and dew can
    generate some 200ml of water per square metre. Elsewhere, the atmosphere is even
    more generous. Worldwide, it is estimated to contain 12,900 cubic kilometres of
    water, roughly the volume of Lake Superior. Moreover, models indicate that evaporation
    driven by global warming will increase these levels by 27% over the course of
    the next 50 years.
