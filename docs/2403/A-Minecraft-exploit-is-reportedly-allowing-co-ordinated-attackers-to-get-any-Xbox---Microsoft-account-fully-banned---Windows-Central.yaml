    not too long ago that Baldur's Gate 3 DVR recordings could cause your account
    to get banned if you recorded and uploaded any of the intimate scenes in the game.
    Now there seems to be another black mark on Xbox's automated content enforcement
    system that has allowed a content creator to get banned through what appears to
    be no fault of their own, though we have yet to hear a response from Microsoft
    about whether or not the YouTuber did violate a polity warranting the ban.

- en: In the Tweet, there is a video embedded from YouTube by Gtamen that explains
    the situation in more detail though with a healthy dose f humor/sarcasm added
    on top. If you want to watch the video yourself please feel free to do so, but
    the important takeaway is that in Minecraft you can do an exploit that allows
    you to *"fill in somebody's GamerTag, then just spam a bunch of slurs, and then
    report said slurs to Microsoft." *

    With other initiatives from Xbox to try to automate moderation of content on its

    attribution and validation of the policy violation before bans are issued.

    and one of the biggest arguments for why that would be a horrible thing is due
    to Xbox gamers' huge digital libraries. I, for one, have around 800 digital games
    in my Xbox library and I can't even imagine the outrage and sense of loss I would
    feel if an automated action were to ban my Xbox account due to false reports made
    through an exploit like the one discussed today.

    in nearly every metric, and I hope as they continue down this path to make the
    Xbox platform safe for its players it can put a bit more intelligence into the
    artificial automation Xbox is using to so casually ban players. If a human had
    reviewed these reports, it is likely that the content creator GhillieMaster wasn't
    even playing Minecraft at the time the malicious chats were crafted and reported
    and a human could have easily checked that and not issued a ban.

    all true of course. There should be an immediate halt to any bans issued due to
    Minecraft-reported chat violations until they are reviewed by a human who can
    verify that this exploit was not used to generate fake inappropriate chats. As
    Xbox enters into this new realm of being one of the largest publishers in the
    world with its recent acquisition of Activision Blizzard and King Xbox can do
    better and it should do better.

    Xbox 最近收购了动视暴雪和 King，进入成为全球最大出版商之一的新领域，Xbox 有能力做得更好，也应该做得更好。
