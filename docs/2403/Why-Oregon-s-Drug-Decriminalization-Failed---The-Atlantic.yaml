    more than three years of painful results. Oregon Governor Tina Kotek has pledged
    to sign legislation repealing the principal elements of the ballot initiative
    known as Measure 110: Possessing hard drugs is again a crime in Oregon, and courts
    will return to mandating treatment for offenders. Oregonians had [supported](https://oregoncapitalchronicle.com/2024/01/16/a-third-way-is-needed-to-address-oregons-drug-crisis/)
    Measure 110 with 59 percent of the vote in 2020, but three years later, [polling](https://gooddrugpolicy.org/2023/08/new-poll-finds-oregonians-regret-measure-110-blame-law-for-increases-in-crime-and-homelessness/)
    showed that 64 percent wanted some or all of it repealed. Although the measure
    was touted by advocates as a racial-justice policy, support for its repeal was
    especially strong among African American and Hispanic Oregonians.'

    of small amounts of drugs such as methamphetamine, heroin, cocaine, and fentanyl,
    and a sharper focus, instead, on reducing the harm that drugs cause to their users.
    [More than $260 million were allocated](https://sos.oregon.gov/audits/Pages/audit-2023-39-Measure-110.aspx)
    to [services](https://sos.oregon.gov/audits/Documents/2023-39.pdf) such as naloxone
    distribution, employment and housing services, and voluntary treatment. The original
    campaign for the measure [was well funded](https://www.oregonlive.com/politics/2020/10/backers-put-millions-behind-nations-first-bid-to-decriminalize-possession-of-heroin-meth-other-street-drugs.html)
    by multiple backers, most prominently the [Drug Policy Alliance, based in New
    York](https://drugpolicy.org/more-about-decriminalization/). Supporters hoped
    that ending penalties—and reducing the associated stigma of drug use—would bring
    a range of benefits. Once drugs were decriminalized and destigmatized, the thinking
    went, those who wanted to continue using would be more willing to access harm-reduction
    services that helped them use in safer ways. Meanwhile, the many people who wanted
    to quit using drugs but had been too ashamed or fearful to seek treatment would
    do so. Advocates foresaw a surge of help-seeking, a reduction in drug-overdose
    deaths, fewer racial disparities in the health and criminal-justice systems, lower
    rates of incarceration, and safer neighborhoods for all.

    misunderstood addiction, and also because they misunderstood the culture and political
    history of Oregon. Both of these misunderstandings should be of keen interest
    to other states and municipalities contending with the fentanyl crisis, and to
    the federal government. An appreciation of what went wrong can help other places
    land on a drug policy that is both humane and effective, instead of veering toward
    one extreme or another.

    safety with dismay, and tried to help stanch the damage. We [testified](https://olis.oregonlegislature.gov/liz/2021I1/Committees/SJD110/2022-09-21-08-30/Agenda)

    were allowed, such as the elimination of open-air drug markets and the resumption
    of mandated treatment for those suffering from severe addiction. But tweaking
    the measure proved very difficult. Last year, one of us, Rob Bovett, began working
    closely with a number of groups trying to reform Measure 110 through legislation,
    including a [bill](https://olis.oregonlegislature.gov/liz/2024R1/Measures/Overview/HB4036)
    based on a [proposal](https://olis.oregonlegislature.gov/liz/2023I1/Downloads/CommitteeMeetingDocument/277671)

    attorneys, and a [bill](https://olis.oregonlegislature.gov/liz/2024R1/Measures/Overview/SB1555)
    based primarily on a [petition](https://sos.oregon.gov/admin/Documents/irr/2024/047text.pdf)

    failure. He [testified](https://olis.oregonlegislature.gov/liz/2024R1/Downloads/PublicTestimonyDocument/103834)

    Fentanyl and meth addiction are not like depression, chronic pain, or cancer,
    conditions for which people are typically motivated to seek treatment. Even as
    it destroys a person’s life, addictive drug use by definition feels good in the
    short term, and most addicted people resist or are ambivalent about giving that
    up. Withdrawal, meanwhile, is wrenchingly difficult. As a result, most addicted
    people who come to treatment do so not spontaneously but through pressure from
    family, friends, employers, health professionals, and, yes, the law.

    also did not understand Oregon, a state in which the measure’s biggest funders
    did not live. Branding Measure 110 as a rebuke to the War on Drugs made no sense,
    because Oregon had never fought such a war. In 1973, it became the first state
    to decriminalize possession of marijuana. When federal and state mandatory-minimum
    sentences for drug crimes flowered in the ’80s and ’90s, Oregon went the other
    way, making it impossible for someone to go to prison for simple drug possession.
    Overall, the state had the country’s [lowest rate of imprisonment for nonviolent
    crimes](https://www.wweek.com/portland/article-20373-the-hard-truth-about-oregons-prisons-they-work.html).
    Short local-jail sentences for drug possession were permitted, but diversion programs,
    including [drug courts](https://www.oregon.gov/cjc/sc/Pages/default.aspx) and
    [community supervision with drug testing](https://www.oregon.gov/doc/community-corrections/pages/home.aspx),
    were widely used. However, after Measure 110 was passed and the *threat* of jail
    time eliminated, the flow of people into these programs slowed.

    drug policy attracted national and international attention, and its high-profile
    failure will likely discourage other states and countries from pursuing maximalist
    decriminalization policies, at least for a time.

    110 got right, at least in principle, is that Oregon’s addiction-treatment system
    was grossly underfunded, with access to care frequently ranking at the bottom
    of national indicators. The mechanism that the measure created to manage new spending
    was clumsy and didn’t work well, but the new law acknowledges the problem and
    provides [extensive new funding](https://www.oregonlegislature.gov/rayfield/Documents/House%20Passes%20Oregon%20Drug%20Intervention%20Plan%20(ODIP).pdf)
    for immediate needs, including detox facilities, sobering centers, treatment facilities,
    and the staff to support those services.

- en: Though our polarized politics tends to frame policy choices as on-off switches,
    in truth they are more like a dial with many intervening settings. That dial can
    be productively turned in many parts of the country. Many states are far more
    punitive toward drug users than Oregon was before Measure 110 passed. They overemphasize
    incarceration of people who use drugs, they do not provide adequate, publicly
    funded health treatment and health insurance, and they do not use criminal justice
    productively to discourage drug use (for instance, by using arrests and probations
    as leverage to get people into drug courts and treatment). If these states could
    be persuaded to dial down their criminal-justice approach to approximate what
    Oregon had *before* Measure 110**,** except with adequately funded, evidence-based
    prevention and treatment, substantial gains in public health and safety would
    likely follow. The future of successful drug-policy reform is not greater laxity
    in states that are already quite progressive in their approach to drug use; it
    is using criminal justice and public health together in a balanced, pragmatic
    fashion, as Oregon is now poised to do.
