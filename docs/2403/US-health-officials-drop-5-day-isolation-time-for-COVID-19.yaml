    in isolation for five days, U.S. health officials announced Friday.

    it once was. It dropped from being the nation’s third leading cause of death early
    in the pandemic to 10th last year.

- en: COVID-19 is not causing as many hospitalizations and deaths as it did in the
    first years of the pandemic. The change is an effort to streamline recommendations
    so they are similar to longstanding recommendations for flu and other respiratory
    viruses. Many people with a runny nose, cough or other symptoms aren’t testing
    to distinguish whether it’s COVID-19, flu, or something else, officials say.

    symptoms should stay home while they are sick, said Dr. David Margolius, the head

    co-workers,” Nuzzo said.

- en: No. The CDC originally advised 10 days of isolation, but in late 2021 cut it
    to five days for Americans who catch the coronavirus and have no symptoms or only
    brief illnesses. Under that guidance, isolation only ends if a person has been
    fever-free for at least 24 hours without the use of fever-reducing medications
    and if other symptoms are resolving.

    that people with the coronavirus were most infectious in the two days before and
    three days after symptoms develop.
