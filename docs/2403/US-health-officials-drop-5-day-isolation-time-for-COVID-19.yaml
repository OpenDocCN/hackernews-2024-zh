    in isolation for five days, U.S. health officials announced Friday.

    first years of the pandemic. The change is an effort to streamline recommendations
    so they are similar to longstanding recommendations for flu and other respiratory
    viruses. Many people with a runny nose, cough or other symptoms aren’t testing
    to distinguish whether it’s COVID-19, flu, or something else, officials say.

    to five days for Americans who catch the coronavirus and have no symptoms or only
    brief illnesses. Under that guidance, isolation only ends if a person has been
    fever-free for at least 24 hours without the use of fever-reducing medications
    and if other symptoms are resolving.
