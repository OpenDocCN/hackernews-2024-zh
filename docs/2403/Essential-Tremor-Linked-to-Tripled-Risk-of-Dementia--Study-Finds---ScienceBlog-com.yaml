- en: A new study has found that people with essential tremor, a common movement disorder
    causing involuntary shaking, may be three times more likely to develop dementia
    compared to the general population. The research, set to be presented at the American
    Academy of Neurology’s 76th Annual Meeting in April 2024, sheds light on the potential
    link between essential tremor and cognitive decline.

    shaking in the arms, hands, head, jaw, and voice. While some individuals experience
    mild tremors, others may have severe symptoms that impact their ability to perform
    daily tasks like writing and eating.

    Medical Center in Dallas, followed 222 people with essential tremor, with an average
    age of 79, over a period of five years. Participants underwent thinking and memory
    tests to assess their cognitive abilities throughout the study.

    had mild cognitive impairment, and 19 had dementia. During the study, 59 developed
    mild cognitive impairment, and 41 developed dementia. The rates of dementia and
    mild cognitive impairment among participants were significantly higher than those
    in the general population, although lower than the rates seen in people with Parkinson’s
    disease.

    our findings provide the basis for physicians to educate people with essential
    tremor and their families about the heightened risk, and any potential life changes
    likely to accompany this diagnosis,” said Dr. Louis.

    valuable insights, researchers acknowledge that a limitation was the use of comparison
    data from the general population that was published prior to the start of the
    study.
