    (WMP) on the naughty step after the force was found to have repeatedly mixed up

    was well, "meaning WMP didn't make a clear distinction between the personal information
    of victims and suspects of crime, a breach of the Data Protection Act 2018," the
    ICO said in a statement today.

    and culminated in a litany of mistakes, including officers going to the wrong
    address when trying to find a person "regarding serious safeguarding concerns."
    Officer also "incorrectly" visited the school of a wrong person's child.

    other, revealing they had been there victim of serious assault, and at the time

    training or done enough to make employees aware of their role in reporting inaccurate
    personal information. The force has since launched Data Quality Policy, and launched
    the "Think before you link" campaign - so catchy that maybe the cops will even
    remember it.

    similar data accuracy issues with other organisations," the reprimand states.

    "maintain relevant records of its processing activities and take steps to improve
    governance measures, take "appropriate action to distinguish the records of the
    two individuals and prevent further inaccurate linking and merging of records
    containing personal data. This should include completing the technical changes
    needed to unmerge the records on the system in a timely manner." It should also
    ensure "learnings" from security incidents are shared across the org and remind
    employees of security policies; and, finally, the ICO said, ensure employees attend
    mandatory data protection training as well as considering "implementing clear
    policies, procedures and training that is specific to the use of the system."
