    California, just south of San Francisco, where developers and founders were testing
    Google's Gemini model. AGI stands for artificial general intelligence and refers
    to a form of AI that can complete tasks to the same level, or a step above, humans.

    how Google can maintain its leadership position in its core market as AI continues
    to grow. He also commented on the flawed launch last month of Google's image generator,
    which the company pulled after users discovered historical inaccuracies and questionable
    responses.

    it was mostly due to just not thorough testing. It definitely, for good reasons,
    upset a lot of people.”

    the political sense.

    Gemini showed a range of people failed to account for cases that should clearly *not* show
    a range. And second, over time, the model became way more cautious than we intended
    and refused to answer certain prompts entirely — wrongly interpreting some very
    anodyne prompts as sensitive. These two things led the model to overcompensate
    in some cases, and be over-conservative in others, leading to images that were
    embarrassing and wrong."'
