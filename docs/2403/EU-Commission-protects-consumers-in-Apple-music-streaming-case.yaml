- en: The European Commission’s [decision](https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_24_1161)
    today that Apple broke EU antitrust rules by restricting consumers’ choice of
    music streaming services in the EU’s Single Market is a strong signal in favour
    of consumers.

    of music streaming apps through its App Store in breach of the EU Treaty antitrust
    rules’ ban on abuse of monopoly power by preventing consumers from making informed
    choices in favour of alternative cheaper options. It is an important step that
    the Commission decided to pursue an ‘exploitative abuse’ case, where a dominant
    company exploits its market power to impose unfair trading conditions on others
    to the detriment of consumers.

    have the right to see information about cheaper choices of music streaming services
    without Apple blocking this. This decision – in combination with effective enforcement
    of the Digital Markets Act – should help consumers benefit from more competitive
    and better digital services.”

- en: After an extensive investigation, in which BEUC [formally participated](https://www.beuc.eu/press-releases/beuc-joins-european-commission-investigation-apple-distorting-competition-music),
    the Commission decided that Apple distorted competition by imposing contractual
    restrictions on app developers which prevent them from informing consumers of
    alternative music subscription options at lower prices outside of the app and
    thereby harmed consumers’ ability to choose those.

    rules prevent developers from informing users about alternative purchasing possibilities,
    which are usually cheaper.
