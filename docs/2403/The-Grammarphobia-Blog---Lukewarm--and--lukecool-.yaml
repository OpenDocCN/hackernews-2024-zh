- en: In *English Lexicogenesis* (2014), an analysis of word formation, the linguist
    D. Gary Miller notes that “some words do not exist despite an obvious need.” One
    of the gaps he mentions is “(*)*lukecool* in the face of *lukewarm*, a very old
    word in English.” The parenthetical asterisk indicates that “lukecool” is considered
    nonstandard.

    not coolness,” Miller writes. “Since only tradition stands in the way of *lukecool*,
    there is no reason it could not become generally accepted if enough people started
    using it.”

    But we think Miller may be too dismissive of the long association of “luke” with
    “warm.”

- en: In fact, “luke” by itself originally meant moderately warm, so “lukewarm” is
    etymologically a puffed-up, or pleonastic, version of “luke.” And “lukecool” is
    etymologically an oxymoron, or contradiction in terms. However, most English speakers
    today are probably unaware of the warmish origin of “luke,” and may believe it
    means something like “sort of.”
