    but I cannot find a commonly used antonym. Why not ‘lukecool’?'

    the opposite of “lukewarm” when it means somewhat warm.'

- en: As for “lukecool,” some creative English speakers are indeed using it as an
    antonym for “lukewarm,” though the usage hasn’t made it into any of the 10 standard
    dictionaries we regularly check.

- en: 'Urban Dictionary, a collaborative slang reference, has several “lukecool” entries,
    including a May 17, 2013, contribution defining it as “only slightly cold, flip-side of lukewarm.”
    The contributor offers an example: “The A/C system must need some freon, it is
    only lukecool in here.”'

    Leventhal, a US Appeals Court judge for the District of Columbia, has observed
    that nonlawyers “are ‘lukecool,’ if not hostile, to lawyers” (from “The Lawyer
    in Government,” a speech delivered Oct. 15, 1971).

    Archaeology. This is from a report about archeologists’ reactions to a proposed

    is between those who are luke-warm and those who perhaps can be described as ‘luke-cool.’
    At a straw vote taken at the Council for British Archaeology on January 8th, 32
    declared themselves to be luke-warm as against 14 who are luke-cool, and this
    sort of split seems to be fairly general.”

- en: In *English Lexicogenesis* (2014), an analysis of word formation, the linguist
    D. Gary Miller notes that “some words do not exist despite an obvious need.” One
    of the gaps he mentions is “(*)*lukecool* in the face of *lukewarm*, a very old
    word in English.” The parenthetical asterisk indicates that “lukecool” is considered
    nonstandard.

- en: “Nothing but tradition makes *luke* acceptable as a qualifier of warmth but
    not coolness,” Miller writes. “Since only tradition stands in the way of *lukecool*,
    there is no reason it could not become generally accepted if enough people started
    using it.”

    But we think Miller may be too dismissive of the long association of “luke” with
    “warm.”

- en: In fact, “luke” by itself originally meant moderately warm, so “lukewarm” is
    etymologically a puffed-up, or pleonastic, version of “luke.” And “lukecool” is
    etymologically an oxymoron, or contradiction in terms. However, most English speakers
    today are probably unaware of the warmish origin of “luke,” and may believe it
    means something like “sort of.”

    is from *Laȝamon*, or *Layamon’s Brut*, an imaginative chronicle of Britain written
    sometime before 1200\. In this gory excerpt, the King of Media kills Bedivere,
    one of King Arthur’s knights, by driving a spear through his byrnie, or coat of
    mail:'

    an Old English adjective meaning warm, sunny, or sheltered. The Old English word
    is the source of *lew*, a Middle English adjective that meant lukewarm and later
    appeared in the phrase *lew-warm*, which survives in dialectal English.'

    stomach it empties it”). From the *Lelamour Herbal *(1373), compiled from various
    Latin and Middle English sources by the Hereford schoolmaster John Lelamour (Sloane
    MS 5, folios 13-57, British Library).

    of “having little warmth or depth of feeling, lacking zeal, enthusiasm or ardour,
    indifferent.” The dictionary’s earliest citation is from a treatise by Thomas
    More:'
