    that we have a tendency to dismiss the impact of the millions of variables that
    lead to an outcome and we thus tend to focus on surface-level results – or single
    outcomes. It meanwhile leads to only thinking or caring about the first-order
    effects of a decision, and because it’s a shortcut, it occasionally results in
    decision-making errors – at times fatal. One would be a bit skeptical of the engineer

    essentially, they’re tools we use for explaining things. For example, when we
    cross a road, we mentally assess how matter moves in a particulate manner, the
    relationship between apparent size and distance, change in size with time and
    velocity, and so forth. We use these models to cross the road. But because mental
    models are so basic to understanding the world, people are hardly conscious of

    government was concerned about the number of venomous cobra snakes in Delhi and
    so it offered a bounty for every dead cobra. The policy initially appeared successful.
    Eventually, however, the number of dead cobras being presented for bounty payment
    began to increase over time and it was discovered that people began to breed cobras
    for the income. When the government became aware of this, the reward program was
    scrapped, causing the cobra breeders to set the now-worthless snakes free. As
    a result, the wild cobra population further increased. The apparent solution to
    the problem made the situation even worse.'

    random movements of atoms. Any explanation is thus strictly mechanistic and materialistic.
