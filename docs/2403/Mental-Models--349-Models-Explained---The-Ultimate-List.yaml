    liquid is stirred. Such fluids are defined by exact proportionality between the
    viscosity of the liquid and the tension it takes to make shifts in the liquid.
    Non-Newtonian fluids are heterogeneous and change viscosity as the rate of stirring
    changes. Rubbing resistance – or friction – is an expression of the force that
    pulls opposite of moving bodies and inhibiting movement.

    through senses. They constitute the basic substance of the world and are, as the
    name implies, indivisible. When atoms are combined in different formations, the
    physical objects that constitute the phenomena of the sensory world arise. From
    an initially unstructured state, the world evolves gradually as a result of the
    random movements of atoms. Any explanation is thus strictly mechanistic and materialistic.
