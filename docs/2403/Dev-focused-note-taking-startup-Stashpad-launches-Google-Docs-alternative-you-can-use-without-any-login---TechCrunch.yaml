    doesn’t require any login and supports Markdown formatting. The product is browser
    first and document history is stored locally, so users can search for docs without
    querying the server. The company said that while there is no offline support at
    the moment, it is a feature that the startup will introduce in the future.'

    However, some of the features like read-only sharing are behind a login. While
    most of the features are free to use, people have to pay for pro features like
    restricted access and priority support. The company is pricing the Pro plan at
    $12 per month or $8 per month if you pay annually.

    in place (using tools like Confluence or Notion), still they would often resort
    to Google Docs for a variety of use-cases. They might do so even without fully
    acknowledging that Google Docs remains a big part of their workflow.”
