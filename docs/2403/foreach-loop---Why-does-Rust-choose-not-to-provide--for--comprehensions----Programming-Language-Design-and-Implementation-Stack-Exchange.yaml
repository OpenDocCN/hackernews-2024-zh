- en: Systems Programmers, however, do care. They may care due to performance reasons,
    they may care due to the lack of memory allocation in their domain (embedded,
    kernel). This means that unlike Python developers, they are *much* more likely
    to need specialized collections, rather than the run-of-the-mill standard collections.

    second-class citizens, and much more awkward to use than 3 blessed standard collections,
    did not sit well with Rust developers.
