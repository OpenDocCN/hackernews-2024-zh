# Folding@home – Fighting disease with a world wide distributed super computer.

> 来源：[https://foldingathome.org/](https://foldingathome.org/)

“Folding” in our community refers to running simulations of proteins, the molecular machines that perform most of the active processes we associate with life, from muscle contraction to sensing light and digesting food. We exploit the biological insight these simulations provide to inform drug discovery and other efforts to combat global health threats.
