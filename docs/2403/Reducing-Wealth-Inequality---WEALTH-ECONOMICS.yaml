- en: If you have read [my theories on Wealth Inequality and the economy](https://www.wealtheconomics.org/introduction-2/),
    you will see that Wealth Inequality is the cause of most of the key problems facing
    our economies today – Wealth Inequality causes low wages, it causes high house
    prices, and it causes a lack of jobs in certain industries and geographic areas
    of the world.

  id: totrans-split-8

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There are number of ways that Wealth Inequality could be reduced, but we can
    divide them all into one of two methods – either the very Wealthy increase their
    spending and reduce their saving (Voluntary Spending), or the government directly
    taxes their wealth (Involuntary Taxation).

- en: Both methods achieve lower Wealth Inequality, but I prefer allowing the wealthy
    to spend their own money, as it is more compassionate, less extreme, less dramatic,
    and doesn’t involve state intervention.  Besides, in many cases people worked
    hard and made sacrifices to accumulate their wealth, and I don’t think it would
    be fair to punish them.

- en: So I think that the fairest and best way is to allow the wealthy to spend their
    own money.  But that is not happening under our current system.  The very wealthy
    spend tiny (in fact negative) proportions of their wealth within their lifetimes,
    meaning that their fortunes take on a life of their own and grow exponentially,
    sucking in the wealth of the poor all over the world.  This is what causes Wealth
    to become concentrated and just the most obvious consequence is extremely expensive
    housing, as houses are accumulated by very wealthy people who never sell them.

    forcing, the descendants of the very wealthy to spend their wealth over  the long
    term, without any resort to taxation.  We could simply place a time limit on physical
    property, the same way we place a time limit on intellectual property.

    think it is fair to allow people who invent works of art or ideas to maintain
    complete economic control of them forever, long after they are dead.  If you write
    a song or a book you own it for (depending on the country) around 100 years.  If
    you invent a new drug or machine the patent (again depending on the country) lasts
    only 20 years.

- en: This means that the creators of great works and inventions can benefit enormously
    financially, in the short term, but, in the long term, once that person is dead,soceity
    can mutually benefit from the art, inventions or ideas.  Initially, the great
    work is the property of the creator, eventually it becomes the property of us
    all.  If we allowed these ideas to stay owned forever, it would detriment us all
    as a society.  As extreme examples, we would all be paying huge chunks of our
    wages to the descendants of the original inventors of farming and metal casting.
     As a society, it doesn’t make sense to allow people’s descendants to keep ownership
    of ideas centiuries after the inventors are dead.

- en: Interestingly, we don’t use the same logic with physical property and land.
     Even though it was given to us by the universe (or god), we allow land to be
    owned into perpetuity.  This allows land and property to be owned in a very concentrated
    fashion, in a way that we would never allow with ideas.  Indeed, much land and
    property are now owned on an inherited basis, based on what was done by now dead
    people,  many generations ago.  This concentrated ownership of now dead people’s
    land and properties causes land and property to become very expensive to the rest
    of us.

    property.  It  is perfectly fine for people to trade and to own it, but not to
    own it forever, long after they are dead.  If one small group of people are allowed
    to own all of the land and property forever, then the majority will always be
    poor.

- en: Let’s place a long time limit on ownership of physical property.  It could be
    very long, as long as 150 years.  Once someone is dead, they can pass their assets
    to their children, but only until that 150 year time limit is reached.  This encourages
    the very wealthy to spend, rather than save forever their assets, and involves
    no state involvement.

    and rocketing wages), and also decreases propensity to hoard houses and land,

    based on inheritance.  Under this new, proposed system, that would reduce to 0%.
     That means that all physical property will reach future generations based on
    their earnings.

    on their earnings, rather than the current rate of 20%.  That means that wages
    will be able to buy 5 times as many houses as they are able to do.  Relative to
    houses, wages will increase 400%.
