    Therefore, it may be unclear how the *undefined behavior* works. This is a daunting
    task even for a very knowledgeable C++ developer. This also hinders tool developers
    from building tools to make software more secure, as well as researchers in software
    safety and security.

    violates the rules in the standard but is not explicitly called out as *undefined
    behavior*. It is just as bad as the explicit kind but much harder to find.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So, one of the main goals of *P1705R1* is to create an ***undefined behavior
    annex*** or listing of ***explicit* *undefined behavior¬†***in the C++ standard.
    Each entry would include a description in accessible language and an example(s)
    of the *undefined behavior* in code. This should allow developers to learn about
    undefined behavior. While we don't expect everyday developers to refer to the
    C++ standard themselves, having the material will allow blog authors, conference
    presenters, and trainers to develop more comprehensive material covering *undefined
    behavior*.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This will also allow the C++ committee to track the growth or shrinkage of *undefined
    behavior*. We also will require future proposal authors to keep the annex updated
    if they add or remove *undefined behavior*. They are making¬†*undefined behavior*
    an explicit topic to be discussed when reviewing a proposal. It also gives explicit
    targets for future proposal writers to attempt to shrink *undefined behavior*
    in the standard.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Another goal that came up during a recent review of the proposal is that we
    want to turn implicit *undefined behavior* into ***explicit undefined behavior***.
    This requires identifying *i**mplicit undefined behavior*** and then having the¬†[Core
    Language Wording Group](https://isocpp.org/std/the-committee)¬† update the wording
    to make the behavior explicitly *undefined*. The benefit here is that we document
    more *undefined behavior*. It is also an opportunity to determine if the intent
    was for this to be *undefined* and, if not, document that.

    I also extend this idea to include adding an ill-formed no diagnostic required

    is still *undefined,* it is a¬†[static property of your program and not a run-time
    property](https://shafik.github.io/c++/2023/07/09/lets-enumerate-ub-part-1.html).
    While this does not have the unrestricted runtime consequences of *undefined behavior,*
    it can still lead to safety and security issues since programs containing *IFNDR*
