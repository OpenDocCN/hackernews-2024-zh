    but as more bit barns seek to trim costs, it's poised to become a rather hot commodity.

- en: All datacenters are energy-hungry but with more watt-greedy AI workloads on
    the horizon, nuclear power has fresh appeal, especially for hyperscalers. Such
    a shift in power also does wonders for greenwashing narratives around net-zero
    operations. While not technically renewable, nuclear power does have the benefit
    of being carbon-free, not to mention historically reliable — with a few notable
    [exceptions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_and_radiation_accidents_and_incidents)
    of course.

    fighting for more than a year to be able to build a pair of AI datacenters adjacent
    to a 2GW Millstone nuclear power plant in Waterford, Connecticut.

    NE Energy has secured $1.6 billion to construct the switching station and bit
    barns, which will span 1.2 million square feet in total. NE Energy will reportedly
    spend an equivalent sum on between 25,000 and 35,000 servers. Considering the
    price of GPU systems from Nvidia, AMD, and Intel, we suspect that those figures
    probably refer to the number of GPUs. We've asked NE Edge for more information.

    are concerned the project would end up increasing the cost of electricity. The
    facilities will reportedly consume as much as 13 percent of the plant's output.

- en: The project's president Thomas Quinn attempted to quell concerns, arguing that
    by connecting directly to the plants, NE Energy will be able to negotiate prices
    that make building such a power hungry facility viable in Connecticut. NE Energy
    has also committed to paying a 12.08 percent premium to the town on top of what
    it pays Dominion for power, along with other payments said to total more than
    $1  billion over the next 30 years.

    a lack of information regarding the datacenter project, it's reported that the
    town council has yet to tell the company what information it is after.

    nuclear site ambitions or are laying the groundwork to do so. Earlier this month,
    Amazon Web Services (AWS) [agreed](https://www.theregister.com/2024/03/04/amazon_acquires_cumulus_nuclear_datacenter/)
    to purchase Cumulus Data's atomic datacenters from $650 million.

    the 2.5 gigawatt Susquehanna nuclear power plant in northeast Pennsylvania. Of
    that, AWS will have the opportunity to purchase up to 960 megawatts of capacity
    to support a sprawling datacenter campus. But, if it doesn't need it, it's only
    required to purchase 480 megawatts of power.

    is actively [exploring](https://www.theregister.com/2024/01/23/microsoft_nuclear_hires/)
    the use of small modular reactors (SMRs), with the idea being that rather than
    build datacenters adjacent to existing reactors, it can install tiny modular ones
    to power existing datacenters.

- en: It should be noted that despite Microsoft hiring folks to explore the application
    of the tech, no functioning SMRs have been built yet.

    [Green Energy Partners](https://www.theregister.com/2023/08/17/virginia_datacenter_smr/),
    and [Bahnhof](https://www.theregister.com/2023/03/08/bahnhof_smr_datacenter/).
    But until SMR vendors, like NuScale, are ready for prime time, there are still
    more than 400 reactors around the globe to collocate with. ®
