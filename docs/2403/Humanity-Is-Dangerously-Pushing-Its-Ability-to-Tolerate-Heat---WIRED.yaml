- en: Humanity’s superpower is sweating—but rising heat could be our kryptonite, and
    an average temperature rise of 2 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels could
    bring regular, fatal heat waves to large parts of the planet, says Tom Matthews,
    a senior lecturer in environmental geography at King’s College London.

    can throw at us,” he explains. But when our core temperature gets to about 42
    degrees Celsius (around 107.5 degrees Fahrenheit), people face heat stroke and
    probable death as the [body strains](https://www.wired.com/story/india-deadly-combination-heat-humidity/)

    the UK broke its high temperature record, surpassing 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees
    Fahrenheit). Scientists [estimate](https://climate-adapt.eea.europa.eu/en/metadata/publications/heat-related-mortality-in-europe-during-summer-2022)
    there were roughly 3,500 heat-associated deaths that summer in the UK. Across
    Europe, they estimate high heat caused more than 60,000 deaths.

    start to experience heat waves exceeding our limit. At 2 degrees Celsius, the
    events increase at least 10 times more often, and if we get to 8 degrees Celsius,
    a large fraction of the Earth’s surface would be too hot for our physiology and
    would not be habitable,” he says.

    intense outdoor work such as rice farming in hotter regions. And these solutions
    will need to be able to meet demand. “The infrastructure must be able to withstand
    the surges when everyone turns on the air conditioning, and must be able to withstand
    hurricanes or floods,” he says.

    forecasting systems that will warn us when disasters are incoming by working together
    at enormous scale. We must continue to do the same.”
