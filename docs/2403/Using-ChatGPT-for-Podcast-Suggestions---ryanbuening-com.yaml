- en: An experiment I tried recently with ChatGPT was to see if it could generate
    some Podcast suggestions for me based on my current podcast subscriptions. I was
    able to supply ChatGPT with an [OPML file](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OPML)
    that is commonly used to transfer podcast subscriptions between podcast apps.

- en: Yes, I'm aware of the OPML (Outline Processor Markup Language) format. OPML
    is an XML-based file format used for creating outlines of information. It's commonly
    used for exchanging lists of web feeds between web feed aggregators or between
    feed aggregators and podcasting clients. OPML files typically contain a hierarchical
    structure of outlines, which can include links, metadata, and other information.
    It's a simple and widely adopted format for organizing and sharing structured
    data.

    The Tim Ferriss Show which already existed in my OPML file, but outside of that,
    it was able to give some decent suggestions. üéôÔ∏èüéß
