- en: The [overclocking team from Asus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fb7pl7PZOYo)
    has achieved a new CPU frequency world record with Intel's brand-new [Raptor Lake
    Refresh Core i9-14900KF](https://www.tomshardware.com/news/intel-core-i9-14900k-cpu-review).
    The team was able to achieve a very impressive 9043.92GHz on a single P-core with
    liquid helium, breaking the previous world record by 35.1MHz.

- en: The overclocking rig used to hit this new world record included Intel's brand-new
    Core i9-14900KF flagship CPU (no integrated graphics), 16GB of G.Skill Trident
    Z memory, an Asus ROG Maximus Z790 Apex Encore motherboard, and a 1200W Enermax
    PSU. For cooling, the team used liquid helium (rarer, colder, and more expensive
    than liquid nitrogen) to reach a minimum thermal threshold of negative 235C–240C.
    According to SkatterBencher, one of Asus' team members, it took the team a whole
    week to break the (now previous) CPU world record.

- en: 35MHz might not sound like a big margin (and it isn't), but in the land of CPU
    frequency records, any minute gains are huge. The previous world record was held
    by the same Asus overclocking team, using Intel's previous-generation Core i9-13900KF
    to hit 9.008 GHz back in December of 2022.

    scoring their world-record result, the team pushed on and managed to briefly hit
    9.1GHz before locking up. Sadly, the system was too unstable to validate the score,
    making it an unsuccessful 9.1GHz attempt. Nonetheless, their 9.1GHz screenshot
    shows there may be more in the tank for Raptor Lake Refresh's enhanced overclocking
    capabilities — we could see another new world record in the not-too-distant future.

    is the company's latest flagship CPU, sporting a lightly refreshed flavor of Intel's
    Raptor Lake CPU architecture. One of the tweaks Intel made for its latest refresh
    is the inclusion of a revised Intel 7 process node that improves the chip's base/boost
    frequencies and improves the chip's overclocking potential. The enhancements appear
    to have paid off, allowing SkatterBencher and his team to (re-)secure a world-record
    result with the new chip.

    latest 14900KF result represents the third broken world record in under a year,
    all with Intel's 13th and 14th Gen chips. Before Intel's Raptor Lake chips stole
    the show, AMD was on top with a world record result of 8.722 GHz on the old Piledrive
    [FX 8350](https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/fx-8350-vishera-review,3328.html),
    a record that had remained unbroken for eight years.
