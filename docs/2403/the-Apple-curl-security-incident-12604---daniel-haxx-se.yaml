    was filed in the curl issue tracker. We get a lot issues filed most days so this
    fact alone was hardly anything out of the ordinary. We read the reports, investigate,
    ask follow-up questions to see what we can learn and what we need to address.

    behavior isn’t consistent between macOS and Linux](https://github.com/curl/curl/issues/12604)*,
    and it was filed by Yuedong Wu.'

    differently than curl binaries built entirely from open source. Even when running
    the same curl version on the same macOS machine.

- en: The curl command line option `[--cacert](https://curl.se/docs/manpage.html#--cacert)`
    provides a way for the user to say to curl that **this is the exact set of CA
    certificates to trust** when doing the following transfer. If the TLS server cannot
    provide a certificate that can be verified with that set of certificates, it should
    fail and return error.

- en: This particular behavior and functionality in curl has been established since
    many years (this option was added to curl in December 2000) and of course is provided
    to allow users to know that it communicates with a known and trusted server. A
    pretty fundamental part of what TLS does really.

- en: When this command line option is used with curl on macOS, *the version shipped
    by Apple*, **it seems to fall back and checks the system CA store in case the
    provided set of CA certs fail the verification**. A *secondary check* that was
    not asked for, is not documented and plain frankly comes completely by surprise.
    Therefore, when a user runs the check with a trimmed and dedicated CA cert file,
    it will not fail if the system CA store contains a cert that can verify the server!

    should not pass.**

    Apple on December 29 2023, 08:30 UTC. It’s not a major problem, but it is an issue.

    with curl on macOS totally unreliable and inconsistent with documentation. It
    tricks users.

- en: Since this is not a security vulnerability in the curl version we ship, we have
    not issued a CVE or anything for this problem. The problem is strictly speaking
    not even in curl code. It comes with the version of LibreSSL that Apple ships
    and builds curl to use on their platforms.
