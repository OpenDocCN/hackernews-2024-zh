- en: In a groundbreaking study examining one of the most influential theories of
    cultural evolution and geographic determinism, a team of ecologists and cultural
    evolutionists from the United States, Germany, and New Zealand has undertaken
    an extensive examination of Jared Diamond’s hypothesis on the axis of orientation.
    The findings have been published in the journal *[Evolutionary Human Sciences](https://doi.org/10.1017/ehs.2023.34).*

    databases, challenges the notion that Eurasia’s geographic layout inherently facilitated
    a quicker spread of critical innovations compared to other regions of the world,
    such as the Americas and Africa.

    proposed that the differing fates of societies across the globe could largely
    be attributed to geographical luck. According to Diamond, the east-west axis of
    Eurasia provided a unique advantage for the spread of agriculture, technology,
    and innovations due to its relatively uniform climates and day lengths over vast
    distances.

    Americas and Africa, where varying climates and ecological zones posed significant
    barriers to the spread of crops and domesticated animals. Diamond argued that
    these geographical and ecological factors played a crucial role in shaping the
    disparate rates of societal development and eventual dominance of Eurasian civilizations.

    first author [Angela M. Chira](https://www.eva.mpg.de/linguistic-and-cultural-evolution/staff/angela-chira/),
    a postdoctoral researcher at the Max Planck for Evolutionary Anthropology, Department
    of Linguistic and Cultural Evolution. “Having a background in macroevolution (i.e.,
    working with big questions), I realized I could devise a quantitative test for
    Diamond’s observations and intuitions. Biogeographic big claims about human history
    are always impressive and attract a lot of attention, but it is important that
    we also follow up with big data analyses where that is possible.”

    from cultural, environmental, and linguistic databases. The methodology centered
    around analyzing the relationship between environmental factors — specifically
    temperature, aridity, and topography — and the transmission of cultural traits
    among 1,094 traditional societies. This approach allowed the team to assess the
    ease or difficulty of cultural transmission across different environmental landscapes.

    Chira explained. “We used least-cost path algorithms to find the paths that minimized
    differences in temperature and aridity regimes between societies. The length and
    cost of these paths give us the magnitude of ecological barriers to cultural transmission
    between two societies, precisely as Diamond envisioned them.”

    barriers do indeed impact the likelihood of cultural traits being shared between
    societies. For example, traits related to subsistence strategies, housing types,
    and social organization showed significant correlations with environmental and
    travel barriers, indicating that the ease of cultural transmission for these aspects
    is closely tied to ecological factors.

    consistently favor Eurasia over other continents. This finding directly challenges
    Diamond’s assertion that Eurasia’s geographic orientation provided a unique advantage
    in the spread of agricultural and other critical innovations.

    and ecological conditions is a global phenomenon, with no clear bias towards Eurasia.
    This suggests that while environmental factors do play a role in shaping the transmission
    of culture, they do not do so in a way that inherently advantages any one continent’s
    societies over another’s.

    and not its conclusion,” Chira told PsyPost. “Our analyses support the hypothesis
    that yes, environment likely influences how cultural innovations spread, just
    like Diamond intuited. However, we did not find evidence that the continents’
    dominant axis uniformly dictates the potential for cultural spread.”

- en: The study underscores the complexity of cultural transmission, revealing that
    the spread of innovations is influenced by a myriad of factors beyond environmental
    and geographic barriers. The findings suggest that factors such as the movement
    of peoples, direct and indirect cultural exchanges, and perhaps even historical
    contingencies, play significant roles in shaping the distribution of cultural
    traits.

    summarized the results by saying, “Our findings point out that geography, like
    genetics and ecology, matters, but it is not destiny.”

    importance of integrating diverse factors—ranging from ecological to social and
    historical—in understanding the mechanisms of cultural spread. By challenging
    the axis of orientation hypothesis, the research invites a reevaluation of how
    we conceptualize the forces shaping human societies, suggesting that geography
    is but one of many factors influencing the trajectory of human development.

    a definitive answer,” Chira explained. “I hope it invites people to think harder
    and deeper on certain matters. The questions Diamond is asking are after all very
    broad in scope, and need to be decomposed in many smaller and manageable hypotheses.
    I hope to see others follow-up. I see this study as falling under the general
    umbrella of work that leverages big open-source datasets to shed light on big
    questions regarding our history.”

    Texas at Austin, concluded: “We do not claim, by any means, to have a definitive
    answer on whether the wheels of history turned at different speeds in different
    parts of the world. What we aim instead is to provide a new perspective based
    on quantitative data and thorough analyses, and a blueprint on how the tools and
    data we already have can be leveraged to test compelling ideas that have strongly
    shaped the public’s understanding of our own past.”'
