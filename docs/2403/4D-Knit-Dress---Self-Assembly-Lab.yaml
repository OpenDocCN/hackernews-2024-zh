- en: Typical garment construction requires a designer to build a 2D pattern, then
    cut and sew from 2D fabric – yielding excess waste, additional cost/labor and
    bulky seams that don’t always follow human anatomy. New innovation in 3D knitting
    – akin to 3D printing - has allowed fabric variation and standardized 3D shaping
    - however customized shaping of knitted garments to fit anyone’s unique body or
    style hasn’t been possible.

- en: 4D Knit Dress, combines several technologies – heat-activated yarns, computerized
    knitting and 6-axis robotic activation to create a garment that is sculpted to
    create a personalized fit or style. Heat-activated yarns are embedded within a
    unique knit structure to create controlled transformation, while maintaining softness,
    stretch and resilience. Using an efficient tubular knitting technique, a 6-axis
    robotic arm (commonly used in automotive manufacturing) heats specific areas to
    take-in – mimicking the design process of pinning & tucking used in traditional
    dress tailoring – transforming the dress in real-time to create a perfect fit
    or a unique look.
