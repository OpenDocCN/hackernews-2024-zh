- en: The goal of Landlock is to enable to restrict ambient rights (e.g. global filesystem
    or network access) for a set of processes. Because Landlock is a stackable LSM,
    it makes possible to create safe security sandboxes as new security layers in
    addition to the existing system-wide access-controls. This kind of sandbox is
    expected to help mitigate the security impact of bugs or unexpected/malicious
    behaviors in user space applications. Landlock empowers any process, including
    unprivileged ones, to securely restrict themselves.

    Landlock support with a [related system call](#landlock-abi-versions). If Landlock
    is not currently supported, we need to [configure the kernel appropriately](#kernel-support).'

- en: Good practices
  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It is recommended setting access rights to file hierarchy leaves as much as
    possible. For instance, it is better to be able to have `~/doc/` as a read-only
    hierarchy and `~/tmp/` as a read-write hierarchy, compared to `~/` as a read-only
    hierarchy and `~/tmp/` as a read-write hierarchy. Following this good practice
    leads to self-sufficient hierarchies that do not depend on their location (i.e.
    parent directories). This is particularly relevant when we want to allow linking
    or renaming. Indeed, having consistent access rights per directory enables to
    change the location of such directory without relying on the destination directory
    access rights (except those that are required for this operation, see `LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_REFER`
    documentation).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Having self-sufficient hierarchies also helps to tighten the required access
    rights to the minimal set of data. This also helps avoid sinkhole directories,
    i.e. directories where data can be linked to but not linked from. However, this
    depends on data organization, which might not be controlled by developers. In
    this case, granting read-write access to `~/tmp/`, instead of write-only access,
    would potentially allow to move `~/tmp/` to a non-readable directory and still
    keep the ability to list the content of `~/tmp/`.

    with a new layer of policy. Indeed, this complementary policy is stacked with
    the potentially other rulesets already restricting this thread. A sandboxed thread
    can then safely add more constraints to itself with a new enforced ruleset.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One policy layer grants access to a file path if at least one of its rules encountered
    on the path grants the access. A sandboxed thread can only access a file path
    if all its enforced policy layers grant the access as well as all the other system
    access controls (e.g. filesystem DAC, other LSM policies, etc.).

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Landlock enables to restrict access to file hierarchies, which means that these
    access rights can be propagated with bind mounts (cf. [Shared Subtrees](../filesystems/sharedsubtree.html))
    but not with [Overlay Filesystem](../filesystems/overlayfs.html).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A bind mount mirrors a source file hierarchy to a destination. The destination
    hierarchy is then composed of the exact same files, on which Landlock rules can
    be tied, either via the source or the destination path. These rules restrict access
    when they are encountered on a path, which means that they can restrict access
    to multiple file hierarchies at the same time, whether these hierarchies are the
    result of bind mounts or not.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: An OverlayFS mount point consists of upper and lower layers. These layers are
    combined in a merge directory, result of the mount point. This merge hierarchy
    may include files from the upper and lower layers, but modifications performed
    on the merge hierarchy only reflects on the upper layer. From a Landlock policy
    point of view, each OverlayFS layers and merge hierarchies are standalone and
    contains their own set of files and directories, which is different from bind
    mounts. A policy restricting an OverlayFS layer will not restrict the resulted
    merged hierarchy, and vice versa. Landlock users should then only think about
    file hierarchies they want to allow access to, regardless of the underlying filesystem.

    with task’s *credentials(7)*. For instance, one process’s thread may apply Landlock
    rules to itself, but they will not be automatically applied to other sibling threads

    It is recommended to always specify both of these together.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    `LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_IOCTL_DEV` rights is associated with the newly created file
    descriptor and will be used for subsequent truncation and ioctl attempts using
    *ftruncate(2)* and *ioctl(2)*. The behavior is similar to opening a file for reading
    or writing, where permissions are checked during *open(2)*, but not during the
    subsequent *read(2)* and *write(2)* calls.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As a consequence, it is possible that a process has multiple open file descriptors
    referring to the same file, but Landlock enforces different things when operating
    with these file descriptors. This can happen when a Landlock ruleset gets enforced
    and the process keeps file descriptors which were opened both before and after
    the enforcement. It is also possible to pass such file descriptors between processes,
    keeping their Landlock properties, even when some of the involved processes do
    not have an enforced Landlock ruleset.

    filesystem (e.g. pipe, socket), but can still be accessed through `/proc/<pid>/fd/*`,
    cannot currently be explicitly restricted. Likewise, some special kernel filesystems
    such as nsfs, which can be accessed through `/proc/<pid>/ns/*`, cannot currently
    be explicitly restricted. However, thanks to the [ptrace restrictions](#ptrace-restrictions),
    access to such sensitive `/proc` files are automatically restricted according
    to domain hierarchies. Future Landlock evolutions could still enable to explicitly
    restrict such paths with dedicated ruleset flags.
