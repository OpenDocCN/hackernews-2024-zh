    transferring 1,800 4K movies over the [internet](https://www.livescience.com/20727-internet-history.html)
    in one second. The median fixed broadband speed in the U.S. in comparison, is
    242.38 megabits per second (Mbps), according to [Speed Test](https://www.speedtest.net/global-index/united-states#fixed).

    through tubular strands of glass — which is how fiber-optic broadband works generally.
    But they tapped into a spectral band that has never been used in commercial systems,
    called "E-band," using new, custom-built devices.

    already laid in the ground — were published in March by the Institute of Engineering
    and Technology (IET), the scientists said in a [statement](https://www.aston.ac.uk/latest-news/aston-university-researchers-send-data-45-million-times-faster-average-broadband#:~:text=Aston%20University%20researchers%20have%20sent,used%20in%20fibre%20optic%20systems.).
    The team also presented the research at the European Conference on Optical Communication
    (ECOC) in Glasgow in October 2023 — but the paper has not been made public.

    and L-band portions of infrared in the [electromagnetic spectrum](https://www.livescience.com/38169-electromagnetism.html)
    — with the particular infrared region used for internet connections occupying
    a range of [1,260 to 1,675 nanometers (nm](http://www.tarluz.com/optical-fiber/pros-and-cons-of-fiber-transmission-bands/)).
    For reference, [visible light](https://www.livescience.com/50678-visible-light.html)
    occupies wavelengths between approximately 400 nm and 700 nm on the spectrum.

    utilized in commercial connections because they're the most stable, meaning the
    least amount of data is lost during transmission. But the scientists speculated
    that one day the sheer volume of traffic will result in these two bands being
    congested — meaning additional transmission bands will be needed to increase capacity.

    nm, has been commercially used in combination with the other two in a system known
    as ["wavelength division multiplexing"](https://www.fiberlabs.com/glossary/wavelength-division-multiplexing/)
    (WDM), in which all three bands are used to reach much higher speeds.

    because the data loss in this region shoots up to extremely high levels — roughly
    five times the rate of loss of transmission in the C-band and L-band regions.

    molecules that can enter the tubes and disrupt connections, either through manufacturing
    or naturally in the environment. E-band is called the "water peak" band because
    extremely high transmission loss is caused by the absorption of OH molecules by
    infrared light in this region.

    the researchers created two new devices called "[optical amplifiers](https://www.globalspec.com/reference/21554/160210/chapter-4-4-2-optical-amplifiers-and-regenerators)"
    and "[optical gain equalizers](https://www.globalspec.com/reference/21556/160210/chapter-4-4-4-optical-gain-equalizers)."
    The former helps to amplify the signal over distances while the latter monitors
    each wavelength channel and adjusts the amplitude where needed. They deployed
    them in the fiber-optic cables to ensure the infrared light transmitted data without
    the instability and loss that normally plagues connections in these bands.

    that operate in the E-band, which sits adjacent to the C-band in the electromagnetic
    spectrum but is about three times wider," said [Ian Phillips](https://research.aston.ac.uk/en/persons/ian-phillips),
    professor of electronics and computer engineering at Aston University in the U.K.
    and one of the scientists working on the project. "Before the development of our
    device, no one had been able to properly emulate the E-band channels in a controlled
    way."'

    connections to demonstrate even faster speeds in recent years. A team at NICT,
    for example, hit the world record of [22.9 petabits per second](https://www.nict.go.jp/en/press/2023/11/30-1.html)
    in November 2023 — 75 times faster than the speed Aston University team achieved.
    They used WDM technology but did not access E-band wavelengths. They demonstrated
    this high-speed connection over a distance of 8 miles (13 kilometers).
