- en: Mercedes-Benz is the latest automotive company to trial how humanoid robots
    could be used to automate “low skill, physically challenging, manual labor.” On
    Friday, [robotics company Apptronik announced](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/apptronik-and-mercedes-benz-enter-commercial-agreement-that-will-pilot-apptroniks-apollo-humanoid-robot-in-mercedes-benz-manufacturing-facilities-302089972.html)
    it had entered into a commercial agreement with Mercedes to pilot how “highly
    advanced robotics” like Apollo — Apptronik’s 160-pound bipedal robot — can be
    used in manufacturing. The news follows a similar pilot announced by [BMW in January](/2024/1/18/24043065/bmw-figure-robotics-humanoid-robot-workers-deployment).

    and deliver components to human production line workers. Neither company has disclosed
    any figures for the agreement or how many Apollo robots are being trialed.

- en: According to Apptronik, humanoid robots would allow vehicle manufacturers to
    start automating manufacturing tasks without having to redesign their existing
    facilities. The company says its approach instead “centers on automating some
    physically demanding, repetitive and dull tasks for which it is increasingly hard
    to find reliable workers.”

    reports that Mercedes has started trialing an undisclosed number of Apollo robots
    at a factory in Hungary. The country has experienced labor shortages for several
    years as workers migrate to Western Europe, with [Audi and Mercedes](https://europe.autonews.com/article/20161019/ANE/161019840/audi-mercedes-face-labor-shortage-in-hungary)
    having both expressed concerns regarding labor supply in 2016\.

    and automotive manufacturing to fill labor gaps in areas such as low skill, repetitive
    and physically demanding work and to free up our highly skilled team members on
    the line to build the world’s most desirable cars,” said Mercedes’ production
    chief Jörg Burzer.

- en: Apollo stands at five feet, eight inches tall, with Apptronik claiming the robot
    can lift objects up to 55 pounds. Its “face” is delightfully goofy, but otherwise
    its form factor isn’t too different from other humanoid robots in development,
    such as [Tesla’s Optimus robot](/2023/5/16/23726139/tesla-robot-update-video-shareholder-meeting),
    or the [Figure 01 robots](/2024/1/18/24043065/bmw-figure-robotics-humanoid-robot-workers-deployment)
    that BMW is trialing at its South Carolina manufacturing facility. Other bipedal
    robots like [Agility Robotics’ “Digit”](/2023/3/20/23648343/agility-robotics-digit-next-gen-bipedal-bot)
    are also being piloted in [Amazon’s US warehouses](/2023/10/18/23922202/amazon-robots-sorting-machines-sequoia-warehouse).

  zh: Apollo身高五英尺八英寸，Apptronik声称该机器人可以举起高达55磅的物体。其“面孔”看起来很滑稽，但除此之外，其外形与其他正在开发中的类人机器人并没有太大区别，比如[Tesla的Optimus机器人](/2023/5/16/23726139/tesla-robot-update-video-shareholder-meeting)，或者[Figure
    01机器人](/2024/1/18/24043065/bmw-figure-robotics-humanoid-robot-workers-deployment)，BMW正在其南卡罗来纳州制造设施试验。其他像[Agility
    Robotics的“Digit”](/2023/3/20/23648343/agility-robotics-digit-next-gen-bipedal-bot)这样的双足机器人也正在[亚马逊的美国仓库](/2023/10/18/23922202/amazon-robots-sorting-machines-sequoia-warehouse)进行试点。
