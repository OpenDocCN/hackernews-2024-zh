- en: Mercedes-Benz is the latest automotive company to trial how humanoid robots
    could be used to automate “low skill, physically challenging, manual labor.” On
    Friday, [robotics company Apptronik announced](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/apptronik-and-mercedes-benz-enter-commercial-agreement-that-will-pilot-apptroniks-apollo-humanoid-robot-in-mercedes-benz-manufacturing-facilities-302089972.html)
    it had entered into a commercial agreement with Mercedes to pilot how “highly
    advanced robotics” like Apollo — Apptronik’s 160-pound bipedal robot — can be
    used in manufacturing. The news follows a similar pilot announced by [BMW in January](/2024/1/18/24043065/bmw-figure-robotics-humanoid-robot-workers-deployment).

    and deliver components to human production line workers. Neither company has disclosed
    any figures for the agreement or how many Apollo robots are being trialed.

- en: According to Apptronik, humanoid robots would allow vehicle manufacturers to
    start automating manufacturing tasks without having to redesign their existing
    facilities. The company says its approach instead “centers on automating some
    physically demanding, repetitive and dull tasks for which it is increasingly hard
    to find reliable workers.”

    reports that Mercedes has started trialing an undisclosed number of Apollo robots
    at a factory in Hungary. The country has experienced labor shortages for several
    years as workers migrate to Western Europe, with [Audi and Mercedes](https://europe.autonews.com/article/20161019/ANE/161019840/audi-mercedes-face-labor-shortage-in-hungary)
    having both expressed concerns regarding labor supply in 2016\.

    and automotive manufacturing to fill labor gaps in areas such as low skill, repetitive
    and physically demanding work and to free up our highly skilled team members on
    the line to build the world’s most desirable cars,” said Mercedes’ production
    chief Jörg Burzer.

- en: Apollo stands at five feet, eight inches tall, with Apptronik claiming the robot
    can lift objects up to 55 pounds. Its “face” is delightfully goofy, but otherwise
    its form factor isn’t too different from other humanoid robots in development,
    such as [Tesla’s Optimus robot](/2023/5/16/23726139/tesla-robot-update-video-shareholder-meeting),
    or the [Figure 01 robots](/2024/1/18/24043065/bmw-figure-robotics-humanoid-robot-workers-deployment)
    that BMW is trialing at its South Carolina manufacturing facility. Other bipedal
    robots like [Agility Robotics’ “Digit”](/2023/3/20/23648343/agility-robotics-digit-next-gen-bipedal-bot)
    are also being piloted in [Amazon’s US warehouses](/2023/10/18/23922202/amazon-robots-sorting-machines-sequoia-warehouse).
