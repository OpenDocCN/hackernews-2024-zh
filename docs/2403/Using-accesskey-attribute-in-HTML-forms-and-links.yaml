    people with motoric disabilities, has proved out to be poorly designed and poorly
    implemented. Although it is still endorsed by some recommendations, it tends to
    reduce accessibility rather than help people, though there are some special situations

    one can use the `accesskey` attribute in [forms](index.html "Annotated links to
    tutorials, references, and specialized documents about HTML forms") and [links](../HTML3.2/4.7.html
    "Discussion of links in an HTML 3.2 tutorial"). When supported by a browser, it
    allows the user to use keyboard keys for functions which are normally done using
    a mouse. For example, to follow a link, one might (in some environments) use the
    Alt key and a letter, as alternative to clicking on the link. This requires that
    the author has specified an access key assignment for that link, using the `accesskey`
    attribute. Unfortunately, browser support to the attribute is limited, and rather
    primitive. The `accesskey` attribute tends to mask out the functionality of a
    browser's predefined keyboard control, which is often much more important than
    page-specific access keys. Moreover, browsers do not indicate that access keys
    are available. Authors may wish to consider including explicit notes about access
    key assignments in their documents; this document suggests some conventions about
    this. It also presents reasons for using only *digit* keys as access keys.

    will focus on the element where the attribute appears. On newer versions, the

    see Microsoft''s documentation of [`accesskey` on IE](http://msdn.microsoft.com/workshop/author/dhtml/reference/properties/accesskey.asp).
    Microsoft calls it "accelerator key" in prose, since similar functionality in
    Windows user interface (e.g., in command menus) was already called that way. The
    name reflects the idea of speeding things up, rather than accessibility. It is
    often faster to use keyboard keys rather than the mouse.'

    If the element is a link, it is not followed. The user can thus move to a link
    (e.g., in order to proceed by tabbing then), as separately from following it,
    which can be activating by hitting the Enter key when the focus is on the link.
    I think this is how things should be, although there's the counterargument that
    *mostly* people just want to follow links when they use access keys for links.
    But the IE implementation might be seen as differing from what the specification
    suggests, especially if you consider the example there that says "In this example,
    we assign an access key to a link defined by the `A` element. Typing this access
    key takes the user to another document, in this case, a table of contents."

    users, especially to people with disabilities, so overriding them could cause
    severe problems, especially when the user does not know about the situation. It
    would be rather distracting if you are accustomed to, say, using Alt-a to Add

    work as an access key for the element but as Home Page Reader's command (for "links
    reading mode"). The keyboard key assignments are often affected by settings at
    the operating system level, too. The problems are illustrated in the detailed
    document [Guidelines for Keyboard User Interface Design](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/?url=/library/en-us/dnacc/html/ATG_KeyboardShortcuts.asp?frame=true).

    key after an element, and additionally bolding the access key letter when applicable--is
    somewhat naivistic but it can reasonably be expected to carry the message to those
    who need it. The main problem with it would probably not be the naivity but the
    fact that a reference to access keys might confuse people who do *not* need that
    information. They might have difficulties in understanding whether "accesskey"
    is something they need to know about. You might consider making that word a link
    to a suitable document about access keys. (The present document of mine can be
    used for the purpose, although it would probably be all too detailed for that.)

    you could use `INPUT TYPE="IMAGE"` and an image which contains the text "Add this"
    with A underlined (and/or bolded), but in practice [image buttons cause more problems
    than they might solve](imagebutton.html). Since the use of uppercase alone is
    not a very good signal--even if you otherwise use all lowercase in submit button

    e.g. so that some specific access key would always take you upwards in a document
    hierarchy. There seems be little hope of uniformity in this area. Quite often
    the access keys *need* to be application-dependent; for example, when you have
    a form with lots of input fields, you might have to use all characters a - z for
    them. Moreover, access key assignments in a document might interfere with *browser
    "standards"*, if the browser implements `accesskey` similarly to access keys in
    its own built-in user interface (as [several browsers do](#warn)).

    why pages should be made useable using keyboard only, without a mouse, and in
    a convenient way. But the `accesskey` attributes don't seem to help in solving
    the problem very well. They might be useful, if a site-wide system of access keys
    makes a site more easily navigable. If you use them, the assignments should be
    described separately, not in `title` attributes or relying on underlining or other
    small hints. And I would recommend using just *digits* for access keys, with digit 0
    acting as access key to a document that describes the other assignments.
