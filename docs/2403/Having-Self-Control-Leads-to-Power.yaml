- en: Out-of-control behavior by CEOs and other powerful people constantly makes headlines
    – so much so that some might consider impulsivity a pathway to power. New research
    from the UC San Diego Rady School of Management and Texas A&M University finds
    that having self-control is often what leads to power.

- en: In a paper published in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, researchers
    find that showing self-control influences how powerful an individual is perceived
    to be by their peers, as well as how much power they are granted by those peers.
    In a series of seven experiments with roughly 3,500 participants, both students
    and working adults read about or interacted with individuals with varying levels
    of self-control, which the researchers define as how much people tend to behave
    in ways aligned with their goals. Across all experiments, individuals with high
    self-control were seen as more powerful, and as better suited for powerful roles,
    than individuals with low self-control.

    the goal of being fit either ate a large dessert or abstained from dessert altogether.
    Researchers found that the colleague was seen as being better suited for high-power
    roles when they abstained from indulging, an indication of self-control.

    or just acted without thinking,“ said Pamela Smith, associateprofessor of management
    at the Rady School of Management and co-author of the study. “What mattered for
    participants’ judgments was whether the colleague acted in line with their goals.
    This pattern held across a variety of goals in our experiments, including saving
    money, being healthy and reading books.”

- en: The researchers also found that people are perceived as less powerful and less
    suited for powerful roles when they fail to meet ambitious goals, even if their
    performance is the same as their peers. In an experiment investigating how self-control
    often leads to power, a group of undergraduate students interacted with individuals
    who set various reading goals. Some set an ambitious goal of reading 200 pages
    each week, while others set a more moderate goal of reading 50 pages per week.
    All of these individuals read the same amount – 100 pages – but those who didn’t
    meet their goal were seen as less powerful by study participants. Furthermore,
    study participants were less interested in having those who didn’t meet their
    goal as the group leader in later tasks.

    goals – goals that are challenging and hard-to-reach. However, we found that setting
    a stretch goal and not meeting it makes someone look less powerful than setting
    an easy goal and surpassing it,” said Rady School PhD student Shuang Wu, the first
    author of the paper.
