    structures, usually derived from stem cells, have been used in labs for nearly
    two decades, where scientists have been able to avoid harmful human or animal

    in an article published last August,” Hartung said. “It is a flexible shell that
    is densely covered with tiny electrodes that can both pick up signals from the
    organoid, and transmit signals to it.”
