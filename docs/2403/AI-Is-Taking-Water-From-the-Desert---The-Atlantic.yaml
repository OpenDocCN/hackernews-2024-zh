    to circumnavigate some data centers. The ones I chose sit between a regional airport
    and some farm fields in Goodyear, Arizona, half an hour’s drive west of downtown
    Phoenix. When my Uber pulled up beside the unmarked buildings, the temperature
    was 97 degrees Fahrenheit. The air crackled with a latent energy, and some kind
    of pulsating sound was emanating from the electric wires above my head, or maybe
    from the buildings themselves. With no shelter from the blinding sunlight, I began
    to lose my sense of what was real.

    back in 2019—a week after the company revealed its initial $1 billion investment
    in OpenAI, the buzzy start-up that would later release ChatGPT. From that time
    on, OpenAI began to train its models exclusively on Microsoft’s servers; any query
    for an OpenAI product would flow through Microsoft’s cloud-computing network,
    Azure. In part to meet that demand, Microsoft has been adding data centers at
    a stupendous rate, spending [more than $10 billion](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/investor/events/fy-2024/earnings-fy-2024-q1.aspx)
    on cloud-computing capacity in every *quarter* of late. One semiconductor analyst

    along the road farther than my eyes could see. A black fence and tufts of desert
    plants lined its perimeter. I began to walk its length, clutching my phone and
    two bottles of water. According to city documents, Microsoft bought 279 acres
    for this location. For now, the plot holds two finished buildings, thick and squat,
    with vents and pipes visible along their sides. A third building is under construction,
    and seven more are on the way. Each will be decked out with rows of servers and
    computers that must be kept below a certain temperature. The complex has been
    designated partly for OpenAI’s use, according to a person familiar with the plan.
    (Both Microsoft and OpenAI declined to comment on this assertion.) And Microsoft
    plans to [absorb](https://datacenters.microsoft.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Azure_Modern-Datacenter-Cooling_Infographic.pdf)

    is funding projects for conserving and restoring water. But it acknowledged that
    most of these upstream efforts support Goodyear residents only indirectly. Many
    of the company’s other efforts to address its environmental impacts also suffer
    from limitations: Carbon offsets and clean-energy power-purchase agreements may
    help Microsoft achieve carbon-negative and water-positive operations on paper,
    but they don’t necessarily net out the effects on local communities, or anyone
    else for that matter. The power-purchase agreements, for example, give utility
    providers money up front to build more renewable-energy or carbon-free-energy
    capacity, but not necessarily on the grids that Microsoft uses. That means the
    company’s data centers may still be running on fossil fuels and generating emissions,
    while clean energy is being underutilized somewhere else. “*Purchasing* clean
    energy is not the same as *physically consuming* clean energy,” Microsoft wrote
    in its [own 2023 white paper](https://news.microsoft.com/de-ch/2023/01/10/carbon-aware-computing-whitepaper/)
    about decarbonizing the cloud. The Microsoft spokesperson said that the company’s

    thousands of power plants, including renewable ones supported by Microsoft’s purchase
    agreements, but that it isn’t possible to specify the exact source of the electricity
