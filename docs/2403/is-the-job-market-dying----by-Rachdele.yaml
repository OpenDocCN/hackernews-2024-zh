    job. He refreshes his resume and searches online for “data science jobs Chicago,”
    trawling through four or five job aggregator sites ranging from somewhat legitimate
    to completely illegitimate. He collects about a dozen jobs that could match his
    skill set, more or less, and he applies. Their “easy apply” online systems make
    sending applications relatively painless. They mostly ask him to type out his
    resume, again and again, in the flattest and most generic way possible. But he
    doesn’t hear back from any of the jobs he’s applied for. He is running out of
    money. He sends dozens more applications for jobs over the next several weeks.
    Maybe even 100\. He hears back from two companies. They are both obvious scams.

    applications in a hiring pool. (Many other people seem to have clicked the “easy
    apply” button.) The hiring manager in charge of the pool becomes overwhelmed –
    no reasonable person could sift through so many resumes – so she does what appears
    to be the smart, fashionable thing and employs an [“AI-based screening tool” or
    “online resume parser”](https://skillpool.medium.com/top-10-ai-based-resume-screening-softwares-6642e0b69569)
    to sift through her pool of applications.

    based on aptitude.”](https://www.filtered.ai/blog/ai-resume-screening-fd) But
    of course she has no idea what it’s really doing.* After some fancy whizzing and
    whirring, it sends her five applications, deemed the “best” (By what metric?).
    My friend’s resume was not selected, but perhaps it will be by another hiring
    manager. Until then, his fate – his ability to pay rent and, crucially, cover
    our next round of Miller High Lifes – will be largely determined by job search
    aggregators, faceless algorithms, and the facetious whims of employers who will
    ask him for as many “[sample assignments](https://www.buzzfeed.com/daniellaflores/handling-free-work-requests-job-interviews)”
    as they want before ghosting him forever. There is basically nothing he can do
    about it.

    numbers,” I think the hiring part of the jobs market is broken. A job posted on
    one industry job board soon makes its way to 20 job aggregator sites, which are
    unaffiliated with the role and the firm who posted it. (They source job listings
    from job boards and company websites and display them on their own platform.)
    Unless you are lucky enough to have a pre-existing connection to a particular
    role, you are relying on the site to provide an active, accurate listing and to
    deliver your application directly to the hiring manager — and for the hiring manager
    to have the time to read it.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: These sites once promised easier access to postings and applications, but now
    create an opaque maze for candidates (quick—what’s the difference between Indeed,
    ZipRecruiter, LinkedIn, Jobtrees, and Monster?) and a genuine headache for employers
    (Are you interested in reading dozens of cover letters today?). Looking ahead,
    I worry about how much these “tools” would make life harder in a recession, and
    about how other trends concerning the future of work might coalesce in harmful
    ways to candidates and employees.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Completely anecdotally, I’ve observed these issues again and again in the last
    year. Job aggregator sites encourage candidates to send buckets of generalist
    applications against the interests of hiring managers who receive an overwhelming
    number of applications that they cannot distinguish from one another. Job postings
    are somehow everywhere but hiring managers complain they can’t find any qualified
    candidates. Layoffs at prestige firms are announced left and right as companies
    pivot away from the pandemic’s free-stimulus-money-for-everyone era (it *probably*
    isn’t indicating an imminent recession, despite what [r/layoffs](https://www.reddit.com/r/Layoffs/)
    would have you believe). To me, concern feels like it’s growing everywhere except
    the cover of the *New York Times*. In fact, a recent survey of 1,500 job candidates
    by the staffing firm Aerotek found [70% of people](https://www.aerotek.com/en/about-us/news-and-events/news/2023/12/aerotek-fall-job-seeker-survey-job-seekers-say-job-hunt-more-difficult)
    find their current job search more difficult than the last, even though people
    are more qualified than before. For the prospective job switchers out there, the
    path to a new role has never been more accessible in theory but frustrating in
    practice.

    broader market. What was once the “Great Resignation” during the late pandemic
    became the [“Great Stay”](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2024-03-07/the-great-resignation-is-now-the-big-stay)
    as employees stay within their own companies instead of switching firms, perhaps
    due to fears of an impending recession or, I would argue, an inability to secure
    a better job. It certainly doesn’t seem like a candidate’s market anymore, and
    instead it feels generally safer to stay and accept your mediocre raise that barely
    meets the annual cost-of-living inflation adjustment.

    market has begun to falter. Is it all because of AI resume screening tools? Certainly
    not, but the combination of a worsening market with the insidious tech trends

    miss out on much-needed talent, candidates miss out on duly-owed salary increases
    and promotions – and the unemployed somehow have to fight even harder.

    One person who is considering switching fields because the “market disappeared”
    from under them. One person whose application tracking excel says he’s applied
    to over 75 jobs and heard back from five. One person who’s been promised a state
    job posting will drop “any day now” for a role he’s guaranteed to get (sorry,
    other applicants!). One person who gave up and became a barista.

    most of my friends are too young to have fully grappled with the impacts of the
    Great Recession. But the market doesn’t feel it’s transitioned out of the flush-with-cash
    pandemic years (when companies boasted the amount of PPP loans they received and
    consumers had more cash on hand to spend than ever before) nearly as well as economists
    have liked to boast. There was a [unique period](https://hbr.org/2023/05/the-high-cost-of-neglecting-low-wage-workers)
    where low-wage, high-stress jobs struggled to hire seemingly because people had
    enough money from Covid checks instead. I don’t think that’s the case anymore.

    or vibes, but that’s sort of the point. Traditional economic indicators can only
    tell part of the story. There’s a lot of value in the stories we hear around us,
    especially when they disagree with the headlines. Kyla Scanlon’s genius coining
    of the term “[vibecession](https://kyla.substack.com/p/the-vibecession-the-self-fulfilling)”
    and subsequent [analysis](https://kyla.substack.com/p/its-more-than-just-vibes)
    of it speak to this phenomenon well. There are genuine divergences between economic
    expectations, theory, and reality. Plenty of understandable reasons contribute
    to this, which Scanlon notes might include misinformation, outsized media coverage,
    and conflating “inflation going down” with “prices going down.” But it is unmistakable
    that consumer sentiment feels much lower than indicators would have you believe.
    An [AP-NORC poll](https://apnorc.org/projects/many-are-uncertain-about-their-financial-futures-as-household-expenses-outpace-earnings/)
    last Fall concluded that 73% of respondents described the current economic status
    as poor, 66% indicated that their expenses have risen, while only 25% indicated
    that their income had risen. That’s worth paying attention to.

    some fresh challenges for candidates.

    about its future has led firms to make wishy-washy demands about employee location
    at times and globalize the market beyond belief in others. One friend of mine
    finally secured a position, only to learn in a final round interview that his
    team’s actual location met deep in the suburbs once a week instead of the city.
    He couldn’t make it work. One recent [study](https://datapeople.io/hiring-in-a-distributed-world/)
    found remote jobs receive over twice the number of applicants for a role than
    in-person jobs; I strongly suspect the true number is much higher. The pandemic
    rapidly accelerated the increasingly global nature of jobs. You’re not competing
    with software engineering graduates in San Jose for the Google internship; you’re
    competing with everyone in the world.

    hiring. Gone is the ZIRP era, money is real again! Maybe there’s a recession around
    the corner! Hiring decisions seem more serious than they were just a couple years
    ago, and this means candidates are subject to more tests to validate their ability.
    Hence more rounds of interviews, more demand for free labor – ahem, sorry, I mean
    “sample project work.” [One-way video interviews](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/one-way-recorded-video-job-interviews-fair-legal-theresa-mcfarlane#:~:text=One%2Dway%2C%20recorded%20video%20job%20interviews%20are%20becoming%20increasingly%20popular,and%20legality%20of%20these%20interviews.)
    are proliferating widely as the number of applicants for each role increases,
    making it easier for employers to stack up content (and effort) from candidates
    and take even longer to sift through it (Who wants to watch 100 videos of people
    talking about their college internship?) Then at the end, there’s no culture of
    providing meaningful applicant feedback, either. So for some candidates, the cycle
    repeats endlessly.

    even if it gives employers less incentive to invest in their employees. According
    to a recent Gallup [report](https://www.gallup.com/workplace/231587/millennials-job-hopping-generation.aspx),
    21% of surveyed millennials reported changing jobs within the past year – which
    is three times higher than any other generation. I am, maybe controversially,
    fairly opposed to job-hopping. I think meaningful work and growth take a lot of
    time. But I’m also increasingly aware that the single best way to get the salary
    increase you’re owed is by job-hopping (and it’s even getting harder to do that).
    New positions are typically market-rate salaries, while typical raises often [don’t
    match market rates](https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20220720-the-case-for-job-hopping).
    One study of [18 million worker salaries](https://money.yahoo.com/job-switchers-are-the-big-winners-202624616.html)
    by Yahoo Finance showed job hopper wages in 2021 outpaced those who stayed in
    their role. (In some industries, workers received almost a 12% pay increase for
    job hopping.)

    be benefitted by networking. I’ve never found it as painful as some people say,
    but I have the privilege of working in an industry that I’m genuinely interested
    in. But the “networking” that’s generally most relevant here is the effective
    kind, where your friend or your Dad knows an employer or you who went to specific
    target school. In this way, networking will always favor the already-privileged.
    There’s maybe an argument that LinkedIn has flattened the playing field a bit,
    but I have personal doubts about the real value of such shallow connections. (But
    I’m happy to be proven wrong on this.)

    to fewer but more specific jobs (but being occasionally willing to take risks
    on yourself all the same!). Accepting that you will be relevant to fewer positions,
    but a greater value-add to those which you are a fit for, seems to be a better
    allocation of time. For employers, the picture is a bit more complicated. Reshaping
    how we apply for jobs means potentially advertising roles with more serious “candidate
    requirements” to limit applicants — but not so serious that you significantly
    reduce the diversity of your hiring pool. We should also be working towards a
    cultural norm where work isn’t handed to candidates unless they are deemed very
    serious contenders for the position, and their work is fairly compensated. Asking
    someone to perform a day of unpaid labor for you is not just “informative,” it’s
    also exploitative.

    an election year!), it’s critical to consider how the current structure of our
    jobs market impacts those who are the least connected. Our attempts to bring universal
    access and universal candidacy may have backfired somewhat by adding layers of
    complication to people who just want to be considered for roles and compensated
    for their labor. But only once we acknowledge these challenges can we start to
    address them.
