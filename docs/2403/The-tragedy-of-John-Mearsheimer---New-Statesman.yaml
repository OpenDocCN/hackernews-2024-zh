    Ukraine to the point where it was becoming a de facto member of [Nato](https://www.newstatesman.com/tag/nato).
    “I didn’t understand the logic of preventive war in Putin’s thinking,” he explained,
    “because I thought Ukraine was a weak power. But once it was clear in the early

    complex of organisations that sought to encourage the US to provide material aid
    to Israel, often against American strategic interests. It was subsequently published

    fight, and I love to fight, I love intellectual combat.” (Huntington’s appreciation

    foreign-policy shibboleths and provides an unblinking guide to the course the
    United States should follow in the coming decades”. But as he told me over email,
    Kaplan now thinks Mearsheimer “goes too far. Putin’s decision to invade was very

    for power. Nevertheless, because they cannot know each other’s intentions, and
    because they operate in an anarchic system, they have to assume the worst about
    each other and have to compete for power. Most people reject the idea that we

    democracy. “Embedded in liberalism,” he told me, “is the belief in progress, the

    – the software that guided US foreign policy. “But,” Mearsheimer explained, “during

    without confronting Machiavelli’s ideas about how to acquire and use power. Mearsheimer’s
    theories of great power politics made him, as Robert Kaplan put it to me, “one
    of the most clairvoyant voices in the political science community”. But his views
    on Western foreign policy, and how it has wrought havoc across the world since
    the end of the Cold War, have seen him denounced as a stooge of its enemies. Lawrence
    Freedman told me that Mearsheimer was now an “isolated” figure.

    End of History thesis caught the spirit of the age when the Berlin Wall fell,
    and Huntington’s theory about the clash of civilisations did the same after 9/11,
    the disturbing force of Mearsheimer’s work may soon have its turn. In years to
    come, in a new age of great power conflict, with Ukraine and Russia perhaps still
    locked in a state of un-peace and the US and China facing off over Taiwan, people
    will be forced to reckon with this thinker who specialises in voicing harsh truths.
    None more so than his chilling message about the tragedy of the world from which
    we will forever be trying to escape.
