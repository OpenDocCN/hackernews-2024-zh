    human intent and machine action through natural language and structured data.

    too unreliable, expensive, and slow for production use in such tasks. We needed
    to create a new kind of model that could handle our workloads in the real world
    at scale.

    models - barely faster than the strongest model and barely more reliable, as of
    early last spring. The first step was to achieve guaranteed structure on common
    JSON types, which is where the compiler originated.

    using the constraint of the output to dynamically scale up and down the amount
    of compute required to produce each token.

    in the model based on the position within the output structure, instead of only
    modifying token sampling. Mathematically, this is a *projection* from the full
    model onto a smaller model with undesired sublayers pruned away.
