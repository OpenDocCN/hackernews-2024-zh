    their days dictated by the rising and setting sun. But Christina did have a vast

- en: The notion of “owning” films digitally has also soured. In 2018, longtime iTunes
    customers who thought they’d purchased films forever were shocked to notice that
    Apple sometimes [deletes](https://theoutline.com/post/6167/apple-can-delete-the-movies-you-purchased-without-telling-you)
    titles from users’ libraries for licensing reasons. Last month customers of Funimation,
    an anime streaming service that was [acquired](https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/8/24065940/funimation-shutdown-crunchyroll-digital-library)
    by Crunchyroll, [learned](https://www.wired.com/story/funimation-digital-libraries-crunchyroll-disappear/)
    that titles they’d bought from Funimation would be deleted.

    are estimated to work for at least two decades and often far longer.

    hard-copy discs to your home to the streaming era, that there was value in retaining
    your own physical media,” the writer and podcaster Sean Fennessey, of The Ringer,
    told me. “Sometimes they just didn’t have discs I wanted. But when they moved
    to a streaming platform, they didn’t have anything. They had one-100th, one-1,000th,
    of what I was looking for.”

    shelves containing “north of 3,000” titles. He increasingly uses his platform
    on The Big Picture and The Rewatchables, two film podcasts with avid followings,
    to evangelize for physical media – a stance that even his co-hosts find “baffling”,
    he said.

    physical media purchases. There were questions about organization. They wanted
    to know [the] best labels. Something is happening. Something is growing.”'

    that he and his wife ran from their home near Philadelphia, DiabolikDVD (“Demented
    discs from the world over”), began doing such brisk business that he moved the
    operation to a warehouse and hired four employees. These days he gets several
    hundred orders a week. The shop mainly caters to fans of horror and cult films,
    but customers have also started requesting more mainstream titles, like the recent
    sports family drama The Iron Claw.

    for Netflix and other streamers at unprecedented rates. Yet some – perhaps nostalgists
    keen to dig up childhood favorites, or cinephiles with time on their hands and
    itchy fingers – also found their way to physical media distributors. [Arrow Video](https://www.arrowvideo.com/),

    and [BFI](https://www.bfi.org.uk/) are probably the best known distributors, but
    in recent years a number of others have thrived, including [Shout! Factory](https://shoutfactory.com/),
    [Vinegar Syndrome](https://vinegarsyndrome.com/) and [Severin](https://severinfilms.com/)
    in the US; [Eureka](https://eurekavideo.co.uk/), [Indicator](https://www.powerhousefilms.co.uk/),

    in the UK; and [Umbrella](https://umbrellaent.com.au/) and [Imprint](https://viavision.com.au/shop/category/imprint-films/)
    in Australia. Some labels inspire cults of their own, with disciples arguing over
    which has the best remasters, special features or packaging. To help cover costs
    up front, many boutiques focus on limited editions; calls for preorders can inspire
    feeding frenzies.

    audiences, Nelson told me. “A studio says, ‘We sold 10,000 copies of this, that’s
    terrible.’ But Vinegar Syndrome says, ‘We sold 10,000 copies, amazing.’”

    “is that a lot of people now look towards distributors as tastemakers, or curators,
    of film. There’s a whole bunch of film movements and people want to track those
    movements and understand more about those directors and groups.”

    – the appeal is also partly aesthetic. Streaming can’t replicate the “pleasure
    of holding the physical representation of a cinematic experience in your hand”,
    Bret Wood at Kino Lorber believes. Boutique releases in particular often have
    beautiful packaging. Online, collectors brag of recent hauls and post “shelfies”.
    Discs’ special features are a wealth of information, as well; fans as well as
    many film-makers have described discs’ behind-the-scenes featurettes as a free
    film school.

    the [final format](https://www.theverge.com/24046669/4k-blu-ray-streaming-physical-media-bitrate-picture-audio-quality-collector)
    of home theater. “The quality blew me away,” one fan told me. The discs’ greater
    expense (for both producers and consumers) and technical requirements, however,
    have limited their market. Some newer video game consoles, such as the PS5 and
    Xbox Series X, play 4K film discs, which could conceivably help popularize them,
    but at the same time an increasing number of gamers are choosing consoles that
    don’t have disc drives at all.

    Simons urged me to remind newcomers that it doesn’t have to be: “I swear to God,
    most of my collection I got at one pawnshop in Atlanta that was selling Blu-rays
    for $2 a piece. And if you are going to buy something new, look for boutique places
    and homegrown stores. Support indie labels.”'

    of labels and an online community given to arcane debates about the merits of
    particular remasters. A classic rookie error is importing a Blu-ray from abroad,
    then discovering it won’t play; discs are often region-locked for rights reasons,
    though the motivated soon find workarounds.

    you can afford it. That’s my pitch.”
