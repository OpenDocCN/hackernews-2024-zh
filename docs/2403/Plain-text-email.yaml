    online. It was at this time that HTML email arrived, creating heated discussions
    in BBSs, mailing lists, and IRC channels.

- en: Email messages can be sent in plain text (`text/plain`), just like files saved
    in Notepad, or in HTML (`text/html`). In this second format (or [“MIME type”](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Basics_of_HTTP/MIME_Types)),
    the messages are created as if they were pages of a website, which opens a Pandora’s
    box, I mean… many possibilities, such as rich formatting and images mixed with
    the text.

- en: HTML email has [some obvious disadvantages](https://subversion.american.edu/aisaac/notes/htmlmail.htm),
    such as less security due to hiding links and loading remote media. An incidental
    problem is that, unlike web browsers, email clients/apps do not follow web standards
    — each one renders HTML differently, which makes the design of newsletter layouts,
    for example, a hellish endeavor.

    they have invisible parts (headers and the HTML code itself) and visible (images,
    in particular) that the pure text counterpart doesn’t have.

    HTML emails can be sent with a plain text copy, useful for cases such as Mauricio’s
    in the late 1990s, that is, people who use email clients unable to render HTML.
    “We were angry because of that,” he recalled.

    were considered alternatives.”

    kept complaining that that was wrong.”'

    much of my work is in the web browser,” he said. “I accepted that life is in the

    enables the HTML version when there is no plain text or it’s messy, such as [Allow
    HTML Temp](https://addons.thunderbird.net/pt-BR/thunderbird/addon/allow-html-temp/),
    is recommended. Evolution, for Linux, also offers this experience.

    into HTML is a visual atrocity.)
