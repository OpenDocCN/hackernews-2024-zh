- en: If you still haven’t migrated your Oculus account to a Meta one, you might want
    to do that soon. In an email sent to users, the company says it will delete Oculus
    accounts on March 29th, 2024, preventing you from reactivating or retrieving your
    apps, in-app purchases, store credits, and more. You’ll lose your achievements,
    friends list, and any content created with your Oculus account if you don’t migrate
    to a Meta account before then.

    as Facebook [started requiring new users](/2020/8/18/21372435/oculus-facebook-login-change-separate-account-support-end-quest-october)
    to sign up with Facebook accounts instead. However, it added the ability to create
    a [Meta account in 2022](/2022/8/23/23318359/meta-quest-vr-account-login-facebook-oculus),
    offering an alternative to users who didn’t want to link their Facebook account
    to their Quest headset. Meta stopped letting users log in to their Oculus accounts
    in January 2023\. If you’ve got a Quest gathering dust in a drawer somewhere,
    now’s your last chance to migrate your Oculus account to a Meta one.

    and signing up for a Meta account with the same email you’ve used for Oculus.
    From there, you’ll be able to access all of the same games, data, and other purchases
    saved to your Oculus account.

- en: Several of us here at *The Verge* received the email, including a couple of
    my colleagues who have already converted their Oculus accounts to Meta. It’s not
    clear whether Meta sent these emails by mistake or if there’s any action Meta
    account holders will need to take. *The Verge* reached out to Meta with a request
    for more information but didn’t immediately hear back.
