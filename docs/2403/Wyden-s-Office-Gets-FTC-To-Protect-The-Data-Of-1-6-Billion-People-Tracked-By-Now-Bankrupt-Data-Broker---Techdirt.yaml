    law or regulate data brokers despite [a parade of dangerous scandals](https://www.techdirt.com/2024/02/15/wyden-data-broker-used-abortion-clinic-visitor-location-data-to-help-send-targeted-misinformation-to-vulnerable-women/).

    Congress [is too corrupt to do its job](https://www.techdirt.com/2023/12/04/our-ongoing-refusal-to-regulate-data-brokers-is-going-to-bite-us-on-the-ass/).

    a sort of regulatory simulacrum designed to distract you. Most recently that popped
    up in the form of [hysteria about TikTok privacy](https://www.techdirt.com/2023/03/21/forget-a-tiktok-ban-we-need-to-regulate-data-brokers-and-pass-a-real-privacy-law/),
    as if TikTok’s privacy abuses aren’t a broader symptom of our corrupt failure
    to protect consumers from a vast and unaccountable network of ethics-optional
    surveillance and monetization.

    and behavioral data [to any nitwit who asks for it](https://www.techdirt.com/2022/05/04/data-brokers-selling-location-data-of-americans-who-visit-abortion-clinics/).
    That’s long been a problem, but it’s become an uglier problem given the rise of
    U.S. authoritarianism and the frontal assault on women’s reproductive health care.

    that one data broker, named Near Intelligence, recently sold the location data
    of women seeking abortion healthcare to an activist group, which turned right
    around and sent [targeted misinformation to vulnerable women](https://www.wyden.senate.gov/news/press-releases/wyden-reveals-phone-data-used-to-target-abortion-misinformation-at-visitors-to-hundreds-of-reproductive-health-clinics).

    tracking the movement and online behavior of **1.6 billion people across 44 countries**.
    But the company went bankrupt last year, and, as [The Markup notes](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/02/how-your-sensitive-data-can-be-sold-after-a-data-broker-goes-bankrupt/),
    there was a real risk that this database would fall into the hands of any number
    of random knobs and shitwhistles looking to exploit and abuse it.

    notes, the FTC agreed, and an order this week blocked the sale or transfer of

    More staff. A clear, well-crafted privacy law that draws hard and clear lines
    about the collection and sale of sensitive consumer data. Hard regulations governing
    how and where and when sensitive user data can be collected, and precisely who
    it can be shared with and sold to with consumer consent.

    extreme profitability of hyper surveillance at scale across countless industries,
    so it seems obvious that the problem gets progressively worse — until there’s
    an unprecedented (potentially fatal) scandal that’s simply impossible to ignore.
