# Journalist casualties in the Israel-Gaza war - Committee to Protect Journalists

> 来源：[https://cpj.org/2024/03/journalist-casualties-in-the-israel-gaza-conflict](https://cpj.org/2024/03/journalist-casualties-in-the-israel-gaza-conflict)

*Editor’s note: The list below is CPJ’s most recent and preliminary account of journalist casualties in the war. Our* [*database*](https://cpj.org/data/) *will not include all of these cases until we have completed further investigations into the circumstances surrounding them. For more information, read our* [*FAQ*](https://cpj.org/2023/11/faq-how-cpj-documents-journalist-deaths-in-the-war/).

The Israel-Gaza war has taken an unprecedented toll on Gazan journalists since Israel [declared war](https://www.cnn.com/2023/10/08/middleeast/israel-gaza-attack-hostages-response-intl-hnk/index.html) on Hamas following its [attack](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-67039975) against Israel on October 7, 2023.

As of May 26, 2024, CPJ’s preliminary investigations showed at least 107 journalists and media workers were among the [more than 36,000 killed](https://www.ochaopt.org/) since the war began, making it the [deadliest period for journalists](https://cpj.org/2023/12/israel-gaza-war-takes-record-toll-on-journalists/) since CPJ began gathering data in 1992.

Journalists in Gaza face particularly [high](https://apnews.com/article/israel-gaza-hamas-militants-conflict-war-b6ea877aa1ee96303aa0870d741da777) risks as they try to cover the conflict during the Israeli [ground assault](https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-war-news-11-15-2023-b85e828db648f5f911278fa217e827e7), including devastating Israeli airstrikes, disrupted communications, supply shortages, and extensive power outages. This has meant that it is becoming increasingly hard to [document the situation](https://cpj.org/2024/05/why-impact-of-israel-gaza-war-has-become-harder-to-document/), and CPJ is investigating almost 350 additional cases of potential killings, arrests and injuries.

“Since the war in Gaza started, journalists have been paying the highest price–their lives–for their reporting. Without protection, equipment, international presence, communications, or food and water, they are still doing their crucial jobs to tell the world the truth,” said CPJ Program Director Carlos Martinez de la Serna in New York. “Every time a journalist is killed, injured, arrested, or forced to go to exile, we lose fragments of the truth. Those responsible for these casualties face dual trials: one under international law and another before history’s unforgiving gaze.”

Journalists are civilians and are protected by International Law. Deliberately targeting civilians constitutes a war crime. In May, the International Criminal Court announced it was seeking [arrest warrant](https://cpj.org/2024/05/cpj-welcomes-icc-warrant-applications-for-hamas-and-israeli-leaders/) applications for Hamas and Israeli leaders for war crimes and crimes against humanity. To date, CPJ has [determined](https://cpj.org/data/people/hamza-al-dahdouh/) that at least [three](https://cpj.org/data/people/mustafa-thuraya/) [journalists](https://cpj.org/data/people/issam-abdallah/) were directly targeted by Israeli forces in killings which CPJ classifies as murders, but is still researching the details for confirmation in at least 10 other cases that indicate possible targeting.

#### As of May 26:

1.  107 journalists and media workers were confirmed killed: 102 Palestinian, two Israeli, and three Lebanese.
2.  32 journalists were reported injured.
3.  2 journalists were reported missing.
4.  38 journalists were reported [arrested](https://cpj.org/2024/05/arrests-of-palestinian-journalists-since-start-of-israel-gaza-war/).
5.  [Multiple assaults, threats, cyberattacks, censorship, and killings of family members](https://cpj.org/2023/10/attacks-arrests-threats-censorship-the-high-risks-of-reporting-the-israel-hamas-war/).

CPJ is also investigating numerous unconfirmed reports of other journalists being killed, missing, detained, hurt, or threatened, and of damage to media offices and journalists’ homes.

The list published here includes names based on information obtained from CPJ’s sources in the region and media reports. It includes all journalists* involved in news-gathering activity. It is not always immediately clear whether all of these journalists were covering the conflict at the time of their deaths, but CPJ has included them in its count as it investigate their circumstances.

 ~~The list is being updated on a regular basis, with names being removed if CPJ confirms that those members of the media were not working journalists at the time they were killed, injured or went missing. 

Israel Defense Forces (IDF) has repeatedly told [media](https://edition.cnn.com/2024/03/20/media/israel-journalists-killed-questions/index.html) [outlets](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/03/19/gaza-journalists-killed-israel-al-jazeera-footage/) that the army does not deliberately target journalists. It also told [agencies](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israeli-military-says-it-cant-guarantee-journalists-safety-gaza-2023-10-27/) in October that it cannot guarantee the safety of the journalists. CPJ [has called](https://cpj.org/2023/12/israel-gaza-war-takes-record-toll-on-journalists/) for an end to the longstanding [pattern of impunity](https://cpj.org/reports/2023/05/deadly-pattern-20-journalists-died-by-israeli-military-fire-in-22-years-no-one-has-been-held-accountable/) in cases of journalists killed by the IDF.

UN experts have [raised concerns](https://www.ohchr.org/en/press-releases/2024/02/gaza-un-experts-condemn-killing-and-silencing-journalists) over the killings of journalists, saying in a February statement that they were “alarmed at the extraordinarily high numbers of journalists and media workers who have been killed, attacked, injured and detained in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, particularly in Gaza, in recent months blatantly disregarding international law.”

Ayman Sharrouf, Raseef22’s political editor, told CPJ that Atallah “wrote for Raseef22 under his name and another pseudonym. He was particularly interested in the daily life stories of the Gazans, despite the siege on Gaza, the corruption, and the narrow political interests in the strip. When the war started, we started collaborating, and he wrote 3 pieces, but he lived in the north where there was intense bombing, and one of the Israeli airstrikes hit his parents’ house, which killed one of his brothers and all his family members.”

Sharrouf told CPJ that “Atallah evacuated after surviving a lot of near-death situations. In his last correspondence with us, he told me that he’s safe and he wants to resume working soon, but I later learned about his death from the news.” Sharrouf added, “Mohammed was a very professional journalist. He wanted to relay the voices of the people. He worked hard on his pieces and was very keen on factual reporting of the daily life of Gaza’s people, despite all the challenges that a journalist like him faces. Unfortunately, he was killed before he got to do what he wanted in journalism; and the most horrific heartbreaking part was that he thought he would survive.”

Manasrah, who was wearing a press vest, told CPJ via phone call after he was hospitalized, that the bullet hit a wall next to him and ricocheted, hitting him in the back. Manasrah said that only journalists were in the area and were visible to IDF soldiers. Manasrah was later released from the hospital on the same day.

Journalist Obada Tahayneh, a freelance reporter for Al Jazeera Mubashar who was at the scene, told CPJ over the phone that “there were approximately 20 journalists present at the scene, only 150 meters away from IDF soldiers. Seven of us moved towards the nearby hospital, when we heard shots fired. We ran and hid next to a wall, and shortly after I saw Manasrah on the ground.” Tahayneh added that he is still “in shock” from being so close to the shooting and witnessing Manasrah’s injury.

Mohamed Balousha

Balousha, a reporter for the Emirati-owned Dubai-based Al Mashahd TV, was shot in the thigh while reporting on the war from northern Gaza on December 16, 2023\. According to his [outlet](https://twitter.com/almashhadmedia/status/1736464958521540824) [Al Mashhad](https://twitter.com/almashhadmedia/status/1736463834192183453), [Al-Jazeera](https://twitter.com/AJArabic/status/1736219669445452263), and the [Palestinian Journalists’ Syndicate](https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=7116399888419527), the bullet was fired by an Israeli sniper. Balousha said in a [video](https://twitter.com/almashhadmedia/status/1736074613149352015) about his injury that he lost consciousness for about 30 minutes after “six hours of agony” and was roused by the nuzzling of cats he was feeding before the shooting. Al Mashhad said that Israeli forces intercepted the ambulances sent to evacuate him, delaying his transfer to a hospital for treatment.

In late November, Balousha broke a [story](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2023/12/18/israel-gaza-journalist-shot-mohammed-balousha/) that four premature babies left behind at al-Nasr Children’s Hospital died and their bodies had decomposed after Israel forced the staff to evacuate without ambulances. Balousha accused Israel of directly targeting him. “I was wearing everything to prove that I was a journalist, but they deliberately targeted me, and now I am struggling to get the treatment necessary to preserve my life,” he told [The Washington Post.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2023/12/18/israel-gaza-journalist-shot-mohammed-balousha/)

***Clarifications and corrections:***

*CPJ has removed a Palestinian man, Mohamed Khaireddine, from this list. Khaireddine was previously identified as a journalist, but his family later clarified that he was neither a journalist nor a media support worker.*

*CPJ has removed two Israeli journalists, Shai Regev and Ayelet Arnin, from this list after their outlets confirmed that the journalists were not on assignment to cover the music festival, nor did they have any opportunity to begin reporting on the attack by Hamas militants that killed them on October 7\. CPJ’s global database of killed journalists includes only those who have been killed in connection with their work or where there is still some doubt that their death was work-related.*

*After receiving reports that Palestinian journalist and presenter Alaa Taher Al-Hassanat may have survived the attack thought to have killed her, CPJ has removed her name from its casualties list pending further investigation.*

**CPJ’s research and documentation covers all journalists, defined as individuals involved in news-gathering activity. This definition covers those working for a broad range of publicly and privately funded news outlets, as well as freelancers.
