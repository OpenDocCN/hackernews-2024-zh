    blogs is HackerNews. I already have a curated list of blogs, but I’m sure I’m
    missing a lot of them. One of my problems is that a priori it’s difficult to know
    which profiles are worth following and which are not. To solve this problem I
    decided to use h-index, a metric used in science to measure the impact of publications.
    With this metric, I can score HN users, and depending on the score decide whether
    to follow them or not. As quick reminder, according to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H-index),
    the h-index is defined as

    has published at least h papers that have each been cited at least h times.

    and with this information is more or less easy to compute this index. The API
    is documented in their GitHub ([HN API docs](https://github.com/HackerNews/API)).

    can you use it to compute your index.

    same endpoint. This means that you can’t query specifically for stories. So you
    don’t know a priori if an item is a comment or a story. We’ll see later that this
    slows down quite a bit the computations.

- en: With these two endpoints, we have all the information we need to compute the
    h-index of a user. To do so we only need to get all the submissions a user has
    made, and then for each submission get the score it has. As I said before, we
    can’t know a priori which submissions of a user are stories and which comments,
    so we need to fetch first the data and then filter by type, which makes the process
    slower.

    The code is quite fast, and it takes around 20 seconds to compute the h-index
    for [pg](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=pg) which has more than 15k submissions,
    of which around 700 are stories. For my user, it takes around 1 second.

    directly in my site. And with some help from a well-known LLM I managed to do
    so. The functionality is now available at [HN-Index](https://www.alexmolas.com/hn-index/).

    one, and I haven’t managed to make it faster yet. So if you know how to improve
    it please write me and I’ll change it. The JavaScript code to fetch and compute
    the index is [here](https://github.com/alexmolas/alexmolas.github.io/blob/master/hn-index/app.js).
    I’m not a JavaScript expert, don’t be too harsh judging the code.

    the index for all the users was unfeasible I decided to check it only for the
    [leaders](https://news.ycombinator.com/leaders). In the following table, we have
    the user with the highest h-index.

    have a very low h-index, which means that almost all their karma comes from comments.
