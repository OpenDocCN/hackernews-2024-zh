- en: Mies van der Rohe brought his purist and perfectionist views to the Bauhaus,
    driven by a passion for order, clarity, and excellence. His initial action upon
    taking on the role of director was to eliminate individuals with political affiliations
    from the school.

- en: Under Mies van der Rohe's leadership, architectural studies were expanded, and
    it seemed that the school was gaining a new lease of life. However, van der Rohe
    had to confront a political situation far more serious than the one opposed by
    Gropius.

- en: In August 1932, the Nazi party took control of the Anhalt province, where Dessau
    was located, and immediately initiated steps towards the closure of the Bauhaus.
    For the Nazis, the Bauhaus symbolized "Bolshevism," decadence, and subversion.
    Consequently, the Bauhaus in Dessau was closed in October 1932.

    in Berlin. He rented an abandoned telephone factory, and Bauhaus resumed its activities
    for what was to be a challenging six months.

    seized the school, conducted searches looking for evidence of communist activities,
    and banned students and lecturers from returning to the school.

    reopen the school, but he couldn't accept the conditions imposed on him. Thus,
    the final closure of the school occurred in July 1933\.

- en: When Gropius was a little boy, homes were illuminated by gas, each room had
    a coal stove, and there were no electric trams, cars, or airplanes. Additionally,
    there wasn't even radio, film, a phonograph, or a telephone.

- en: The world in which Gropius grew up, even in 1919, seemed relatively simple,
    and the idea of planned environmental transformation was not an absolute utopia.
    However, over the next twenty years, there was such technological development
    that no reformers could keep pace with these changes.

    strides in this field. But, as Gropius stated, he couldn't act faster than the
    society he was meant to serve.

- en: Gropius, who merged 19th-century idealism with 20th-century realism, was convinced
    that the foundation of all reforms lies in education. However, views on what and
    how to teach evolved gradually as Bauhaus adapted to changes in the field of sociology.

- en: In the 19th century, the idea emerged that it was possible to teach the artist
    skills that would create a formula unifying all branches of art, including architecture
    and design. This idea resurfaced in the 1920s in the debates among futurists and
    constructivists, and Bauhaus in Weimar was the first large-scale initiative aiming
    to put these theories into practice.

- en: Soon, it became apparent that reconciling the artist's ideals with industrial
    demands was not feasible and that new means of action were necessary to bridge
    the gap between art and technology. To find these means, Bauhaus developed a radical
    and revolutionary educational program.

    Bauhaus style, based on simple geometric forms, reflecting the influences of constructivism
    and cubism.

    clients. Designers cannot impose new standards based on revolutionary design solutions
    until society is ready to accept them.

    the profound humanism stemming from efforts to understand the psychological and
    physical needs of humans was Bauhaus's most valuable contribution to 20th-century
    architecture and design.
