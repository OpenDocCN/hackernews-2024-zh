    nearly two years. Earlier this year, [it was announced](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38861271)
    that the company was being acquired by [Airtable](https://airtable.com) and that
    the product would be shut down. In this blog post, I want to explain what happened
    from my perspective as a former employee.

    onboarding lots of new customers, we expanded the team from 12 people to more
    than 20, and there was a general sense of excitement about our prospects both
    internally and in conversations with users.

    with the CTO, I really liked all of my other coworkers, the mission of the company,
    and the technologies that I got to use day-to-day. I felt like I was [learning
    a lot as an engineer](https://www.airplane.dev/blog/category/hash-benjamin), and
    I was hopeful that the company would continue to expand and provide growth opportunities
    for me in the future.

- en: In the summer of 2023, the company hit some headwinds. First, although we were
    still adding customers, our revenue growth rate had noticeably slowed down. From
    what I understand, this was a trend across the entire SaaS tooling space that
    wasn’t unique to Airplane, but it still hurt morale and made us less optimistic
    about the company’s near-term future.
  id: totrans-split-12

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In addition, people on the team started quitting. Up until that summer, we had
    had zero employee attrition. Then, within a three month period, we lost 4 engineers
    and the company’s head of growth. These colleagues had all been at the company
    for a while and all had legitimate reasons for resigning unrelated to the revenue
    slowdown (several, for instance, wanted to start their own companies), but the
    latter didn’t soften the blow. They were all well-respected and great at their
    jobs, so we were sad to see them go.

    leaving so that he could work on a personal, AI-related passion project. The CTO
    (the other co-founder) would be taking his place. His departure wasn’t a huge
    surprise- he had been very clearly burnt out and disengaged for months. But, it’s
    still never a good sign to lose the leader of your organization.

    died down, and we added several new engineers and a new growth lead to the team.
    We also had some substantial product launches and signed two big, new enterprise
    customer deals. Our Q3 revenue numbers were strong, and we had new customers excited
    to sign with us in Q4.

    in-person and hack on various new product features. The CEO was a little less
    engaged than usual, but otherwise morale was high and there were no signs that
    anything was wrong.

    our team’s Slack workspace. Effective immediately, we were winding down our hiring
    pipeline. We were also rescinding two engineering offers that we had just extended.
  id: totrans-split-20
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: My colleagues and I knew that this was a bad sign. Rescinding offers is something
    that causes a lot of reputational harm and isn’t done casually. Companies generally
    only do this if they’re about to do layoffs or go through some sort of big transformation
    like an acquisition. The former didn’t make any sense, though, because we had
    lots of money in the bank (enough to last for many years at our current burn rate),
    had already slimmed the team down via voluntary attrition, and had an overflowing
    backlog of new features to work on. That left an acquisition as the most likely
    explanation.
  id: totrans-split-21
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Several people on the team confronted the CEO, but he denied that there was
    an acquisition brewing. Instead, he made vague statements about “figuring out
    the direction of the company” and potentially doing some sort of product pivot
    to reignite growth. He claimed that any update would be good news and that he’d
    make sure we were taken care of.

    rescinded, the CEO scheduled an all-hands for 1PM that day. He also sent out a
    Slack message that this was a very important meeting and that we should cancel
    other things if needed to be there. We knew that we would finally be getting answers
    about what was going on.

    of Airplane’s mission, “We’re here because we believe that software is a force
    multiplier…”, but ended with the clause that we’d be continuing that mission as
    part of Airtable.

    of us would be getting “extremely strong” offers from Airtable. However, we’d
    have to do interviews for leveling purposes, and the financial details wouldn’t
    be made available to us until later. This was a great outcome for us, he said,
    much better than the alternatives he had considered, so we should be happy. The
    goal was to wrap everything up before the holidays.

    we were optimistic at the beginning when we heard about Airtable, the mood had
    clearly soured as we got more information. Basically, our product was being shut
    down, we’d have to interview for our new jobs, it was unclear what we’d be doing
    at the new company, and our stock was potentially worthless. It was also unclear
    why, exactly, we were doing this given that Airplane had many happy customers
    and tens of millions of dollars in the bank.

    personal situations. For me and the other engineers, the CEO told us that he enjoyed
    working with us and hoped that we’d continue at Airtable together. Our common
    stock was worth $0, but we’d be getting extra cash bonuses from Airtable to compensate.
    The exact details of our levels and roles were not known and would depend on the
    interviews to be done later in the week.

    was an [acqui-hire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acqui-hiring). Airtable wasn’t
    interested in our product, our technology, or our customers. They wanted our CEO
    to lead their new AI effort, and the rest of the company was baggage that would
    be accommodated to the minimum degree required. It was depressing for all of us.

    gotten an offer back in 2019 but had decided at the time that it wasn’t a fit
    for me. Since then, the company had expanded greatly but then contracted abruptly
    via two large layoffs. Airtable’s headcount was about half of what it had been
    a year before, which seemed kind of depressing to me.

    We were mostly asked about our previous experiences and projects. In my case,
    it was clear they were probing how high they would move me in the IC chain. My
    interviewers were interested in hearing about how I managed cross-company projects
    at the large companies on my resume as opposed to any of my technical work at
    Airplane.

- en: Later that week, we got our Airtable offers. They were strong but definitely
    not as out-of-this-world as the CEO had promised. In addition to a base salary
    and equity, we were each offered a $50-75k signing bonus that would have to be
    paid back in full if we quit in the first year. We were given three business days
    to make a decision, and there would be no severance if we declined.

    about Airtable to begin with, and the whole acquisition process had left a sour
    taste in my mouth. In addition to shutting down the product and abandoning our
    customers, Airtable had never given us a product demo, detailed financial information
    about the company, or precise details on what we’d be working on aside from “AI-related
    features”. The whole process seemed like a rushed, disorganized mess, and I knew
    that there were better things out there.

    As expected, customers were shocked and upset. Many had been using Airplane for
    critical workflows within their organizations, and they now had to replace huge
    chunks of internal tooling before the final shutoff on March 1\. The CEO tried
    to steer people to alternatives like [windmill.dev](https://windmill.dev) and
    [Retool](https://retool.com), but neither of these is a drop-in replacement for
    Airplane. Even if users found replacement tools, it would take a lot of time and
    effort for them to do the migration.

    paperwork to sign, and there were no formal goodbyes. The company had disintegrated
    with a sad whisper.

    terms. Contrary to what one would logically think in these circumstances, we didn’t
    run out of money or even come close to that. In fact, we had tens of millions
    of dollars in the bank (allowing for years of runway) in addition to a great team,
    relatively happy customers, low churn, and solid revenue growth.

- en: When pressed in 1:1 conversations, the CEO said that he didn’t see a path to
    significantly higher revenue. He claimed we would have to do a significant product
    pivot and/or change our sales strategy to grow beyond a particular point, and
    that this transformation would be risky and hard. It was easier to quit while
    we were ahead, shut everything down, and work on something new.

- en: To me and others, it seemed like the CEO was tired of the startup grind and
    simply giving up. Ever since his fellow co-founder quit, he’d been running both
    the technical and go-to-market sides of the company, and it was clearly very draining.
    We felt that he wanted a less stressful position with a lower risk payday, and
    this kind of deal was the best way to achieve that.

    pretty happy. In looking back, the thing that upsets me the most is not the loss
    of money (I never put much value on my stock options anyways) but rather the multitude
    of customer relationships that were flushed down the drain by abandoning the product.
    Many of these customers had personally stuck their necks out within their organizations
    to drive adoption of Airplane, and had spent hundreds of hours migrating critical,
    internal workflows to our product. Now, they were being thrown under the bus.

    the details of the offers that the CEO considered, but I feel like he could have
    either: (1) held out for an acquisition offer that involved keeping the product
    running, (2) separately sold the Airplane technology to another entity that would
    continue developing it, or (3) open-sourced the product. In the end, he unilaterally
    chose an outcome that I believe was not the best for our product or our customers,
    and it was sad that we all had to go along with it.'
