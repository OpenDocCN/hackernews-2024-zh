  zh: 初始困难
- en: In the summer of 2023, the company hit some headwinds. First, although we were
    still adding customers, our revenue growth rate had noticeably slowed down. From
    what I understand, this was a trend across the entire SaaS tooling space that
    wasn’t unique to Airplane, but it still hurt morale and made us less optimistic
    about the company’s near-term future.

  zh: 在2023年夏季，公司遇到了一些困难。首先，尽管我们仍在吸引新客户，但我们的收入增长率明显放缓。据我了解，这是整个SaaS工具领域的趋势，并非Airplane独有，但这仍然打击了士气，使我们对公司近期的前景不那么乐观。
- en: In addition, people on the team started quitting. Up until that summer, we had
    had zero employee attrition. Then, within a three month period, we lost 4 engineers
    and the company’s head of growth. These colleagues had all been at the company
    for a while and all had legitimate reasons for resigning unrelated to the revenue
    slowdown (several, for instance, wanted to start their own companies), but the
    latter didn’t soften the blow. They were all well-respected and great at their
    jobs, so we were sad to see them go.

- en: To top it all off, the CEO (who was also a co-founder) announced that he was
    leaving so that he could work on a personal, AI-related passion project. The CTO
    (the other co-founder) would be taking his place. His departure wasn’t a huge

    that causes a lot of reputational harm and isn’t done casually. Companies generally
    only do this if they’re about to do layoffs or go through some sort of big transformation
    like an acquisition. The former didn’t make any sense, though, because we had
    lots of money in the bank (enough to last for many years at our current burn rate),
    had already slimmed the team down via voluntary attrition, and had an overflowing
    backlog of new features to work on. That left an acquisition as the most likely
    explanation.
  id: totrans-split-21

  zh: 我的同事们都知道这是一个不祥的迹象。撤销offer会给公司声誉造成很大损害，并且不会随意为之。公司通常只有在即将裁员或经历某种重大变革（如收购）时才会这样做。然而，前者并不合理，因为我们有足够的资金（以目前的烧钱速度可以维持多年），已经通过自愿流失缩减团队规模，并有大量新功能积压待开发。因此，最可能的解释是被收购。
- en: Several people on the team confronted the CEO, but he denied that there was
    an acquisition brewing. Instead, he made vague statements about “figuring out
    the direction of the company” and potentially doing some sort of product pivot
    to reignite growth. He claimed that any update would be good news and that he’d

- en: The CEO, who was presenting from his home in SF, started with his usual statement
    of Airplane’s mission, “We’re here because we believe that software is a force

    of us would be getting “extremely strong” offers from Airtable. However, we’d
    have to do interviews for leveling purposes, and the financial details wouldn’t

    we were optimistic at the beginning when we heard about Airtable, the mood had

    at the new company, and our stock was potentially worthless. It was also unclear

- en: For the remainder of the day, we met 1:1 with the CEO to talk more about our
    personal situations. For me and the other engineers, the CEO told us that he enjoyed
    working with us and hoped that we’d continue at Airtable together. Our common
    stock was worth $0, but we’d be getting extra cash bonuses from Airtable to compensate.

- en: Based on these discussions, we put the pieces together and realized that this
    was an [acqui-hire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acqui-hiring). Airtable wasn’t
    interested in our product, our technology, or our customers. They wanted our CEO

- en: The interviews took place a week later and, thankfully, were fairly low stress.
    We were mostly asked about our previous experiences and projects. In my case,
    it was clear they were probing how high they would move me in the IC chain. My

- en: Later that week, we got our Airtable offers. They were strong but definitely
    not as out-of-this-world as the CEO had promised. In addition to a base salary
    and equity, we were each offered a $50-75k signing bonus that would have to be

- en: I said no, without much hesitation. As mentioned previously, I wasn’t excited
    about Airtable to begin with, and the whole acquisition process had left a sour
    taste in my mouth. In addition to shutting down the product and abandoning our
    customers, Airtable had never given us a product demo, detailed financial information
    about the company, or precise details on what we’d be working on aside from “AI-related

    pretty happy. In looking back, the thing that upsets me the most is not the loss
    of money (I never put much value on my stock options anyways) but rather the multitude
    of customer relationships that were flushed down the drain by abandoning the product.
    Many of these customers had personally stuck their necks out within their organizations
    to drive adoption of Airplane, and had spent hundreds of hours migrating critical,
    internal workflows to our product. Now, they were being thrown under the bus.

  zh: 总体而言，我在 Airplane 有一段不错的经历，直到最后一个月我都挺开心的。回顾过去，最让我感到不安的不是金钱的损失（我本来就不太看重我的股票期权），而是放弃产品导致大量客户关系泯灭。这些客户中许多人曾在其组织内部冒着风险推动
    Airplane 的采纳，并花费数百小时迁移关键的内部工作流程到我们的产品上。现在，他们被抛弃了。
- en: 'Were there any alternatives to what the CEO did? I obviously don’t know all
    the details of the offers that the CEO considered, but I feel like he could have
    either: (1) held out for an acquisition offer that involved keeping the product
    running, (2) separately sold the Airplane technology to another entity that would
    continue developing it, or (3) open-sourced the product. In the end, he unilaterally
    chose an outcome that I believe was not the best for our product or our customers,
