    reason for dropping its Android and iOS NissanConnect EV app services, with some
    3,000 Nissan Leaf and e-NV200 commercial vehicles manufactured before 2016 affected
    in the UK, according to the [BBC](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-68426263).

    such as the ability to remotely heat or cool the vehicle, as well as the option
    to set up charging schedules that allow batteries to be brimmed when energy tariffs
    are at their cheapest... all from the convenience of a smartphone.

    2G and 3G mobile networks "[past 2033](https://www.ofcom.org.uk/phones-telecoms-and-internet/information-for-industry/policy/2g-and-3g-switch-off)",
    effectively giving Nissan another ten years to offer support to customers.

    Bluetooth and/or Wi-Fi connectivity that allows for charge scheduling, or look
    to upgrade their vehicle entirely.

    ICE cars can easily be upgraded with an infotainment system that plugs into a
    smartphone and offers much of the same services as its modern counterparts can.
    The bottom line is, so long as there's fuel, they will still run.

    the ability to communicate with the public charging network or update to the latest
    safety firmware, becomes impossible. At this point, they become more like a smartphone,
    which has to be recycled or worse, discarded.

    for seven to nine years max. Compared to the smartphone industry, Android gives
    you two years, [Samsung](https://www.techradar.com/sg/tag/samsung) gives you three
    years and iPhone might give you four," he said.'

    serviceable, this sort of timescale seems incredibly near-sighted and it is part
    of the reason we are witnessing terrible residual values on some of the most expensive
    EVs, such as Porsche's Taycan. Low mileage, secondhand models can be picked up
    with more than 60 per cent off the original asking price in some markets.

    today's EVs become future classics unless they continue to be supported, patched
