    the urgent transplant list at Queen Elizabeth hospital, [Birmingham](https://www.theguardian.com/uk/birmingham)
    (QEHB). If a donor couldn’t be found within 72 hours, she would die. But she got
    lucky. By 7pm the woman – later known in court as Patient A – was anaesthetised
    and unconscious on the operating table, with a healthy, deep-red donor liver glistening
    on ice for her nearby.

    (HPB) surgeon on call that evening, was one of only about two dozen in the country
    at the time who specialised in liver transplants. At 49 years old, Bramhall had
    already performed the operation nearly 400 times. On any given day, there would
    be at least 10 trainees from around the world working with him, learning from
    his experience. In a centre of excellence, he was one of the best.

    surgery, cutting-edge stuff, right at the borders of what was technically possible.

    in 2010 when a Cessna transporting a liver for a patient on the super-urgent transplant
    list crashed in fog coming in to land at Birmingham airport, bursting into flames.
    The blackened ice cooler containing the precious liver was recovered from the
    wreckage reeking of smoke and aviation fuel, and Bramhall was able to use the
    salvaged organ to perform a successful transplant that evening. “Crashing and
    burning is not something we normally do with our donor livers,” [he remarked at
    the time](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-birmingham-11813897).

    theatre, followed by transplants until after midnight, before starting again the

    so most donor organs are retrieved early in the evening or overnight, and then
    have to be given to the recipient as quickly as possible. “The longer it takes,
    potentially the poorer the outcome is for the recipient. There’s a lot of pressure.”
    But it was satisfying work. Liver transplants are visibly transformative for patients:
    within a few days, their skin will go from yellow to pink as their health returns.

    A’s new liver, taking a sample of tissue at the first opportunity after the transplant;
    should problems arise later, this would help physicians work out what had gone
    wrong. He used a large needle to do this, and reached for the argon beam coagulator
    to cauterise the bleeding. “I held the liver in my left hand,” he begins. “There
    was a little nobble of blood on the top. I squeeze the liver, stop the bleeding
    with the argon just for 20 or 30 seconds – let go, make sure it’s still not bleeding.

    of damage. The cellular damage is *tiny*.” He scratches his face. “When I was
    training, and during the early part of my consultant period, there was plenty
    of black humour in operating theatres. There are stories about ophthalmologists
    putting their signatures on the retina when they are using the laser on retinopathy.
    I’ve seen orthopaedic surgeons squiggle things in the cement when they’re putting

    attempt at relieving the tension was a pointless exercise.” He says he doesn’t
    remember being challenged by the nurse who went on to tell the trust that Bramhall
    had said, “I do this”. If he did say this to her, he says, it was because he must
    have thought she was asking him about the time-zero biopsy, because not every

    it either.” Bramhall claims his legal team advised him to plead guilty to charges

    patient on to the intensive care unit and get home.” He didn’t think anyone outside
    his operating theatre would see the letters he had burned on to Patient A, anyway,
    because the burn should have healed within days. He didn’t think about how Patient
    A might feel about his joke. And he never thought about the donor whose liver
    he had signed. “Once the liver has perfused [has the blood of the recipient circulating

    Bramhall is not the only surgeon to have marked a name on a patient – but he’s
    the only British one to be sanctioned for it.

    public scrutiny. In September 2023, the [Working Party on Sexual Misconduct in
    Surgery published a report](https://wpsms.org.uk/docs/Breaking_The_Silence_Addressing_Sexual_Misconduct_In_Healthcare.pdf)
    into problems in UK theatres – where the ratio of male to female surgeons [is
    now 8:1](https://www.rcseng.ac.uk/careers-in-surgery/women-in-surgery/). Nearly
    two-thirds of the female surgeons who responded to the WPSMS survey said they
    had been sexually harassed in the past five years, and a third had been sexually
    assaulted. Consultant surgeon Tamzin Cuming, who co-authored the report, sees
    Bramhall’s actions – and the delay in him being struck off – as evidence of a
    culture of impunity that persists more than a decade after Patient A’s liver was
    signed. “He wouldn’t have done it secretly,” she tells me. If any of the other
    people in the operating room had seen him, she adds, “either they were appalled
    and they didn’t feel empowered to report it, or it’s normalised and accepted that
    anything these prima donna surgeons say goes”. Cuming draws parallels with a [female
    surgeon who told the BBC](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-66775015) last September
    about the senior male surgeon who wiped his sweaty face on her breasts during
    a procedure. “That was not hidden in an office – that was in front of everyone
    in surgery. He was not struck off. He is still practising.”

    off. “I apologised profusely and he accepted that.” But when other people at QEHB
    came to see the photograph of the branded liver after the other HPB surgeon started
    to share it, a suspension pending an investigation became inevitable. The trust’s
    panel ultimately issued Bramhall with a written warning, and the GMC ruled that
    he should remain on the medical register. “[This failing in itself is not so serious
    as to require any restriction on Mr Bramhall’s registration](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/dec/13/surgeon-admits-marking-his-initials-on-the-livers-of-two-patients),”
