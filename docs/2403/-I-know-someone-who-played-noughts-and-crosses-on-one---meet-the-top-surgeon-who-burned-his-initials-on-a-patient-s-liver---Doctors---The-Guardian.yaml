    the urgent transplant list at Queen Elizabeth hospital, [Birmingham](https://www.theguardian.com/uk/birmingham)
    (QEHB). If a donor couldn’t be found within 72 hours, she would die. But she got
    lucky. By 7pm the woman – later known in court as Patient A – was anaesthetised
    and unconscious on the operating table, with a healthy, deep-red donor liver glistening
    on ice for her nearby.

  zh: 2013年8月21日上午，女王伊丽莎白医院（QEHB）的一名急需肝脏移植的患者（来自伯明翰）因为急性肝功能衰竭被列入紧急移植名单。如果在72小时内找不到供体，她将不幸去世。但她很幸运。到了晚上7点，这位女士—后来在法庭上被称为A患者—已经被麻醉并无意识地躺在手术台上，附近放置着一颗健康的深红色供体肝脏，上面冰晶闪闪发光。
- en: QEHB had one of the UK’s leading liver units, and Simon Bramhall, the hepato-pancreato-biliary
    (HPB) surgeon on call that evening, was one of only about two dozen in the country
    at the time who specialised in liver transplants. At 49 years old, Bramhall had
    already performed the operation nearly 400 times. On any given day, there would
    be at least 10 trainees from around the world working with him, learning from
    his experience. In a centre of excellence, he was one of the best.

    first broke, he remembers lying down with his cheek pressed against his kitchen
    floor, hiding from the lenses poking over the fence to get a shot of him – a painful
    fall from grace for someone used to being hailed as a hero. But he has decided
    to give this interview because of the forthcoming release of Letterman. We speak
    for several hours on Zoom over patchy broadband from his home in Cornwall, where
    he now writes his novels. He doesn’t want me to say exactly where he is, or to
    come to his house, in case it upsets his wife, who is even more wary of media

    The blackened ice cooler containing the precious liver was recovered from the
    wreckage reeking of smoke and aviation fuel, and Bramhall was able to use the
    salvaged organ to perform a successful transplant that evening. “Crashing and
    burning is not something we normally do with our donor livers,” [he remarked at

    have to be given to the recipient as quickly as possible. “The longer it takes,
    potentially the poorer the outcome is for the recipient. There’s a lot of pressure.”
    But it was satisfying work. Liver transplants are visibly transformative for patients:
    within a few days, their skin will go from yellow to pink as their health returns.

    A might feel about his joke. And he never thought about the donor whose liver

    into problems in UK theatres – where the ratio of male to female surgeons [is
    now 8:1](https://www.rcseng.ac.uk/careers-in-surgery/women-in-surgery/). Nearly
    two-thirds of the female surgeons who responded to the WPSMS survey said they
    had been sexually harassed in the past five years, and a third had been sexually
    assaulted. Consultant surgeon Tamzin Cuming, who co-authored the report, sees
    Bramhall’s actions – and the delay in him being struck off – as evidence of a
    culture of impunity that persists more than a decade after Patient A’s liver was
    signed. “He wouldn’t have done it secretly,” she tells me. If any of the other
    people in the operating room had seen him, she adds, “either they were appalled
    and they didn’t feel empowered to report it, or it’s normalised and accepted that
    anything these prima donna surgeons say goes”. Cuming draws parallels with a [female
    surgeon who told the BBC](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-66775015) last September
    about the senior male surgeon who wiped his sweaty face on her breasts during
