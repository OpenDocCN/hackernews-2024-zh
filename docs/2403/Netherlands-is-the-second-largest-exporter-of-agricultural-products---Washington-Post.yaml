- en: The Netherlands is the biggest exporter of meat in the European Union, and in
    2020, it exported 8.8 billion euros’ (about $9 billion) worth of pork, beef and
    poultry, primarily to Germany (beef and veal), Britain (poultry) and China (primarily
    pork).

- en: Vion Food Group has 12 production locations for pigs. Four of these are in the
    Netherlands and eight are in Germany. The company slaughters 15 million pigs and
    almost 1 million cows annually — that’s more than half of all Dutch pigs and nearly
    40 percent of Germany’s total swine herd. Boxtel, a town in the southern Netherlands,
    is home to Vion’s largest pig slaughter facility, dispatching 20,000 pigs per
    day. Vion uses artificial intelligence to detect and flag signs of animal cruelty
    and to minimize animal stress. In many U.S. slaughter facilities, crowding and
    high noise levels can increase animals’ fear, and animals are frequently killed
    via electrocution, which many experts say is less humane.

- en: Pigs ready for slaughter are 175 days old and weigh about 265 pounds. Upon arrival
    by truck from regional farms, 80 pigs are herded off a platform and into the facility,
    and a veterinarian checks for sick or wounded animals.

    gas. Once the animals are anesthetized, they are hung by their legs and killed
    swiftly via stabbing.

    are dipped in a hot bath to remove bristles, the remainder are burned off at high
    temperature (which also kills bacteria). Pigs are cut in half longitudinally and
    then cooled from 98.6 degrees down to 44 degrees Fahrenheit.

    of the butchering done by hand. Internal organs are sold to China and for pet
    food, hams are often sold to Italy, and ribs may find their way to major restaurant
    chains in the United States.

- en: Kipster is an egg company aimed at improving animal welfare, tackling food waste
    and producing certified carbon-neutral eggs. Farms incorporate natural light and
    fresh air, and chickens are free from cages to pursue their instincts and animal
    natures. And in a departure from the global practice of killing male chicks that
    are irrelevant in the egg-laying business, the males are kept and raised for meat.

- en: Kipster chickens are fed entirely with food waste from supermarkets and food
    manufacturers, rather than with commodity grains. Thirty percent of the world’s
    grain production is for animal feedbut “I’d rather use all arable land to produce
    cereals for people,” said managing director Ruud Zanders.

- en: Kipster was launched by four entrepreneurs in 2017 and now has three farms in
    the Netherlands as well as a farm in North Manchester, Ind., from which Kroger
    buys all of Kipster’s eggs. By next June there will be four farms in the United
    States, with each house containing 24,000 birds, and each of the facilities will
    be open to the public to observethe animal welfare practices.

  zh: 基普斯特由2017年四名企业家创立，现在荷兰有三个农场，以及印第安纳州北曼彻斯特市的一个农场，从那里克罗格（Kroger）购买所有基普斯特的蛋。到明年六月，美国将有四个农场，每个农舍包含24000只鸟，每个设施都将向公众开放以观察动物福利实践。
- en: Farms have indoor gardens with skylights, trees, tree trunks for climbing and
    ground for pecking (thebirds are not de-beaked). With zero emissions, the farms’
    energy is generated by solar panels.Zanders uses Dekalb White chickens — a calm
    and sociable breed. White birds and white eggs have a 5 percent lower carbon footprint
    than brown birds and brown eggs (brown birds are a bit bigger and eat more, and
    white birds and eggs reflect the sun more effectively). Adult male birds and females
    at the end of their productivity are used primarily for meatballs sold in Europe
    by the Lidl grocery chain, which also buys all of Dutch Kipster’s eggs.

  zh: 农场内设有带天窗的室内花园，树木和树干供鸟类攀爬和啄食（鸟类未做去喙处理）。农场零排放，能源由太阳能电池板生成。Zanders使用德卡尔布白鸡 —— 一种温和且善社交的品种。白色鸟和白色蛋的碳足迹比棕色鸟和棕色蛋低5%（棕色鸟略大且食量更大，而白色鸟和蛋更有效地反射太阳）。成年雄性鸟和生产末期的雌性鸟主要用于欧洲利德尔（Lidl）超市销售的肉丸，该超市还购买所有荷兰基普斯特（Kipster）的蛋。
- en: The concept was developed with input from both the Dutch Society for Prevention
    of Cruelty to Animals as well as Wageningen University & Research to maximize
    animal welfare and to ensure flexibility and scalability. With an easy-to-assemble
    modular construction, Zanders said, the Kipster model is replicable and suitable
    for urban agriculture.

  zh: 该概念得到了荷兰防止虐待动物协会和瓦赫宁根大学与研究的意见，以最大化动物福利并确保灵活性和可扩展性。Zanders表示，基普斯特模型采用易于组装的模块化结构，可复制并适用于城市农业。
