- en: Reddit user u/sgircys on the DataHoarder subreddit reports that EVGA accidentally
    destroyed 22TB of storage in his work PC. After RMAing his EVGA power supply for
    coil whine issues, EVGA sent him a newly revised version of the same unit he bought
    featuring an upgraded pin layout. Unfortunately, EVGA forgot to send sgircys updated
    power supply cables to account for the changes. So when sgircys went to plug everything
    in, the power supply sent too much voltage to the wrong wires, frying all his
    storage devices.

    his shiny new [EVGA GQ 1000W](https://www.tomshardware.com/news/evga-gq-series-power-supplies,30526.html)
    Gold power supply. After contacting EVGA, he sent the unit (at his own expense)
    to EVGA to get the problem resolved. But in typical fashion, EVGA told the Reddit
    post to keep all his accessories and power supply cables as they wouldn't be returned
    if shipped. This is not an unusual practice for most power supply manufacturers.

    to find that the PC was not working. Worse, he heard a click indicating an OCP
    mechanism was being triggered. After troubleshooting, he found he could power
    on the system, but only after he unplugged all his SATA-powered devices.

    the pin layout of these power supplies was changed,” confirming why the power
    supply wasn’t working. The EVGA rep sent him a new batch of cables compatible
    with the newly rewired version of his power supply for him to use.

    cables, Sgircys discovered that all of his drives—22TB worth—were fried. The old
    cables he used previously fried all of his SATA-powered storage due to the improper
    voltages flowing through the incorrect wires.

    replace his storage devices, saying the following: “I’ve never encountered a warranty
    that offers to cover loss of data or the costs related to the recovery of data
    and to the letter of our warranty terms, we technically don’t cover any loss or
    damages incurred by our products either.” EVGA also encouraged the Reddit poster
    to make a warranty claim from the drive manufacturer(s) themselves to get his
    storage drives replaced.'

    supply pin layouts on its existing GQ lineup, which doesn't always happen. Regardless,
    it is somewhat surprising that EVGA has not replaced Sgircy's affected storage
    devices, especially since this is rare. If the Reddit poster can't get his drives
    replaced through his drive's warranty, he'll have to replace all of his storage
    devices out of pocket, which won't be cheap.
