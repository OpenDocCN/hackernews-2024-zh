    software packages uploaded to the Python Package Index (PyPI) has spread to GitHub
    and expanded to reach at least 100,000 compromised repositories.

    legitimate repos, infecting them with malware loaders, uploading the altered files
    to GitHub under the same name, then forking the poisoned repo thousands of times
    and promoting the compromised code in forums and on social media channels.

    true nature. For example, the code hides its use of the exec function – for dynamically
    executing code – through a technique dubbed “exec smuggling”.
