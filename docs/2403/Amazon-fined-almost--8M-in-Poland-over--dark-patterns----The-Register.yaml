    subsidiary around $8 million (31.9 million Zlotys) for "dark patterns" that messed
    around internet shoppers.

- en: The preliminary ruling applies to Amazon EU SARL, which oversees Amazon's Polish
    e-commerce site, Amazon.pl, out of Luxembourg. Poland's Office of Competition
    and Consumer Protection said the decision, subject to appeal, reflected misleading
    practices related to product availability, delivery dates, and drop-off time guarantees.

- en: According to the ruling, Amazon's Polish operation repeatedly canceled customer
    orders for e-book readers and other gear. The online souk believed it was within
    its rights to do so because it considers its sales contract and delivery obligations
    are active only after an item has shipped, rather than when the customer purchases
    it.

    paid for stuff and were awaiting delivery disappointed, sparking complaints to
    the watchdog, which has seemingly upheld the claims.

    warning this could happen is difficult to read – "it is written in gray font on
    a white background, at the very bottom of the page."

    contract to buy an item, such as "Buy Now" and "Proceed to Checkout." And this
    language suggests that a commitment has been made, the agency contends. As such,
    people were right to be upset when these commitments were broken by the technology
    goliath whenever it canceled their orders for whatever reason.

    chairman Tomasz Chróstny in a [statement](https://uokik.gov.pl/en/pln-31-million-fine-for-amazon).

    pattern" – a deceptive or misleading graphic or text element within a software
    application or website. It's said that Amazon presented customers with timers
    and product availability counters to push them to complete a purchase before time
    or supply ran out, and then sometimes failed to fulfill orders.

    US operations. Last June, the US Federal Trade Commission [sued Amazon](https://www.theregister.com/2023/06/21/amazon_prime_ftc_lawsuit/)
    alleging it used manipulative interface design to dupe customers into automatically
    renewing their Prime memberships. That case, along with [a broader antitrust claim](https://www.theregister.com/2023/11/02/amazon_ftc_project_nessie/),
    continue to be litigated.

    of $30.4 billion, or around $3.5 million an hour, every hour for a whole year.
    As such the Polish judgment is an accounting blip, but one the Seattle souk intends
    to fight. ®
