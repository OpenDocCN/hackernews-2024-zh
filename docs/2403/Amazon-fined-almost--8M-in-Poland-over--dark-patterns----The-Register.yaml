  zh: 波兰的竞争与消费者保护监督机构对亚马逊的欧洲子公司处以大约800万美元（3190万兹罗提）的罚款，因为其“黑暗模式”搞乱了互联网购物者。
- en: The preliminary ruling applies to Amazon EU SARL, which oversees Amazon's Polish
    e-commerce site, Amazon.pl, out of Luxembourg. Poland's Office of Competition
    and Consumer Protection said the decision, subject to appeal, reflected misleading
    practices related to product availability, delivery dates, and drop-off time guarantees.

  zh: 初步裁定适用于亚马逊欧盟有限责任公司，该公司负责亚马逊波兰电子商务网站Amazon.pl，总部位于卢森堡。波兰竞争与消费者保护办公室表示，此决定在上诉的情况下反映了与产品供应、交货日期和送货时间保证相关的误导性做法。
- en: According to the ruling, Amazon's Polish operation repeatedly canceled customer
    orders for e-book readers and other gear. The online souk believed it was within
    its rights to do so because it considers its sales contract and delivery obligations
    are active only after an item has shipped, rather than when the customer purchases
    it.

  zh: 根据裁定，亚马逊波兰分部多次取消了客户的电子书阅读器和其他设备订单。这家在线商城认为有权这样做，因为它认为其销售合同和交货义务仅在商品发货后才生效，而不是客户购买时。
- en: But these abrupt cancellations left punters who thought they'd successfully
    paid for stuff and were awaiting delivery disappointed, sparking complaints to

  zh: 突如其来的取消订单让本以为已成功支付并等待交付商品的顾客感到失望，引发了对监管机构的投诉，后者似乎支持了这些主张。
- en: Not only that, the regulator was unimpressed that the language on Amazon's website
    warning this could happen is difficult to read – "it is written in gray font on
    a white background, at the very bottom of the page."

  zh: 不仅如此，监管机构对亚马逊网站上警告可能发生的情况的语言却难以阅读并不感兴趣：“它是用灰色字体写在白色背景上的，位置在页面的最底部。”
- en: What netizens instead see are phrases that indicate they're entering into a
    contract to buy an item, such as "Buy Now" and "Proceed to Checkout." And this
    language suggests that a commitment has been made, the agency contends. As such,
    people were right to be upset when these commitments were broken by the technology
    goliath whenever it canceled their orders for whatever reason.

  zh: 网民实际看到的是提示他们正在签订购买商品的合同的短语，例如“立即购买”和“进入结账”。这种语言暗示着已经做出了承诺，监管机构称，因此当亚马逊因任何原因取消他们的订单时，人们感到失望是正当的。
- en: '"The average consumer is entitled to assume that the purchase options, availability
    and delivery times offered by traders are not misleading," said the agency''s
    chairman Tomasz Chróstny in a [statement](https://uokik.gov.pl/en/pln-31-million-fine-for-amazon).

- en: The regulator also characterized Amazon's use of countdown timers as a "dark
    pattern" – a deceptive or misleading graphic or text element within a software
    application or website. It's said that Amazon presented customers with timers
    and product availability counters to push them to complete a purchase before time
    or supply ran out, and then sometimes failed to fulfill orders.

  zh: 监管机构还将亚马逊使用倒计时器描述为“黑暗模式” —— 软件应用或网站中的欺骗性或误导性图形或文本元素。据称亚马逊向客户展示计时器和产品可用性计数器，以促使他们在时间或供应耗尽之前完成购买，然后有时未能履行订单。
- en: '"Information about the availability of a product and its fast shipping is very
    valuable for consumers and for many people it can be the main reason why they
    make a purchase decision," said Chróstny.'

  zh: “有关产品供应情况及其快速送货的信息对消费者非常宝贵，对许多人来说，这可能是他们做出购买决策的主要原因，”克罗斯特尼说。
- en: '"However, such information must not be a decoy. If a trader gives a specific
    delivery date, they must meet it. This practice by Amazon is categorized as ‘dark
    patterns’, as it uses pressure to make the consumer order the product as soon
    as possible."'
