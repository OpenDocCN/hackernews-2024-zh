    spelling bee contestants, the local arts community, nonprofit organizations, community
    events, high school sports, industry accomplishments, and much more," Chevron
    spokesperson Catie Matthews wrote in a statement for this story. "Additionally,
    the platform has amplified coverage of local stories by other news outlets, and

    organizations who would otherwise not have one."'

    Permian Proud's article "[Chevron's Permian Basin operations to tap into more
    recycled water](https://permianproud.com/chevrons-permian-basin-operations-to-tap-into-more-recycled-water/),"
    is almost identical to Chevron's [press release](https://www.chevron.com/newsroom/2022/q3/permian-basin-operations-to-tap-into-more-recycled-water#:~:text=We%20reached%20an%20agreement%20with,by%20the%20end%20of%202023.).
    The original text read, "By using recycled water in our fracking operations, we
    help preserve fresh water and groundwater in drought-prone areas." Permian Proud
    swapped "Chevron helps" for "we help."
