    the three train tracks that intersect here. Older kids play soccer on a field
    with a coach while younger ones cavort on a playground. Beyond the school fence,
    the Chevron plant stands less than a mile away. A sign next to the school's entrance
    warns of a shallow hazardous liquid pipeline from another petroleum company, Phillips
    66, a warning to not dig there.

    The English-language site emerged as Chevron confronted lengthy multibillion-dollar
    litigation seeking to hold it liable for the pollution from oil drilling there.

    Chevron's legal battle spread to other nations, including the U.S. and Brazil.
    The American attorney who led the suits against Chevron for Ecuadorian farmers
    and Indigenous peoples was a frequent target of the site. He was ultimately disbarred
    in New York for his actions in the case.
