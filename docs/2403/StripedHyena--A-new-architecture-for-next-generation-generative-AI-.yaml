    with 7 billion parameters. What makes it special: StripedHyena uses a new set
    of AI architectures that aim to improve training and inference performance compared
    to the widely used transformer architecture, used for example in [GPT-4](https://the-decoder.com/open-ai-gpt-4-announcement/).'

- en: The release includes StripedHyena-Hessian-7B (SH 7B), a base model, and StripedHyena-Nous-7B
    (SH-N 7B), a chat model. These models are designed to be faster, more memory efficient,
    and capable of processing very long contexts of up to 128,000 tokens. Researchers
    from HazyResearch, hessian.AI, Nous Research, MILA, HuggingFace, and the German
    Research Centre for Artificial Intelligence (DFKI) were involved.

    compete with the best open-source transformers. The base model achieves comparable
    performance to [Llama-2](https://the-decoder.com/how-to-get-started-with-metas-llama-2-guide/),
    Yi, and [Mistral 7B](https://the-decoder.com/new-open-source-llm-mistral-7b-outperforms-larger-meta-llama-models/)
    on OpenLLM leaderboard tasks and outperforms them on long context summarization.

- en: 'The core component of the StripedHyena models is a state-space model (SSM)
    layer. Traditionally, [SSMs](https://kevinkotze.github.io/ts-4-state-space/) have
    been used to model complex sequences and time series data. They are particularly
    useful for tasks where temporal dependencies need to be modeled. In the last two
    years, however, researchers have developed better and better ways to use SSMs
    for sequence models for language and other domains. The reason: they require less
    computing power.'

    faster than conventional transformers in the end-to-end training of sequences
    of 32,000 tokens, 64,000 tokens, and 128,000 tokens.'

- en: The main goal of the StripedHyena models is to push the boundaries of architectural
    design beyond transformers. In the future, the researchers plan to investigate
    larger models with longer contexts, multimodal support, further performance optimizations,
    and the integration of StripedHyena into retrieval pipelines to take full advantage
    of the longer context.
