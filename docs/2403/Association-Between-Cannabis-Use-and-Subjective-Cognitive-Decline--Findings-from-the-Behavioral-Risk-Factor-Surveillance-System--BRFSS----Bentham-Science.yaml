- en: 'Background: Cannabis consumption has rapidly increased in the United States
    due to more states legalizing non-medical and medical use. There is limited research,
    however, investigating whether cannabis may be associated with cognitive function,
    particularly across multiple dimensions of cannabis use.'

    reason, frequency, and method are associated with subjective cognitive decline

    2021 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS). SCD was a self-reported
    increase in confusion or memory loss in the past year. Odds of SCD by cannabis
    use reason, frequency, and methods (e.g., smoke, eat, vaporize) were examined
    using multiple logistic regression after imputing missing data, applying sampling
    weights, and adjusting for sociodemographic, health, and substance use covariates.'

    associated with 96% decreased odds of SCD (aOR=0.04, 95% CI=0.01-0.44, p<.01).
    Medical (aOR=0.46, 95% CI=0.06-3.61, p=.46) and dual medical and non-medical use
    (aOR=0.30, 95% CI=0.03-2.92, p=.30) were also associated with decreased odds of
    SCD, although not significant. Cannabis consumption frequency and method were
    not significantly associated with SCD.'

    with SCD. Further research is needed to investigate the mechanisms that may contribute
    to the observed associations between non-medical cannabis use and decreased odds
