- en: 'Background: Cannabis consumption has rapidly increased in the United States
    due to more states legalizing non-medical and medical use. There is limited research,
    however, investigating whether cannabis may be associated with cognitive function,
    particularly across multiple dimensions of cannabis use.'

- en: 'Objective: The objective of this study was to examine whether cannabis consumption
    reason, frequency, and method are associated with subjective cognitive decline
    (SCD).'

- en: 'Methods: Data were obtained from 4,744 U.S. adults aged 45 and older in the
    2021 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS). SCD was a self-reported
    increase in confusion or memory loss in the past year. Odds of SCD by cannabis
    use reason, frequency, and methods (e.g., smoke, eat, vaporize) were examined
    using multiple logistic regression after imputing missing data, applying sampling
    weights, and adjusting for sociodemographic, health, and substance use covariates.'

- en: 'Results: Compared to non-users, non-medical cannabis use was significantly
    associated with 96% decreased odds of SCD (aOR=0.04, 95% CI=0.01-0.44, p<.01).
    Medical (aOR=0.46, 95% CI=0.06-3.61, p=.46) and dual medical and non-medical use
    (aOR=0.30, 95% CI=0.03-2.92, p=.30) were also associated with decreased odds of
    SCD, although not significant. Cannabis consumption frequency and method were
    not significantly associated with SCD.'

- en: 'Conclusion: The reason for cannabis use, but not frequency and method, is associated
    with SCD. Further research is needed to investigate the mechanisms that may contribute
    to the observed associations between non-medical cannabis use and decreased odds
    of SCD.'
