### **LOW – MEDIUM CONFIDENCE**

## Executive Summary

This report analyzes a potentially burgeoning movement within Russian digital forums focused on organizing a nationwide strike in May 2024\. The movement aims to destabilize the current government and challenge President Vladimir Putin’s regime through economic disruption and peaceful protest. Drawing parallels with the Euromaidan protests, participants discuss leveraging the critical timing before the U.S. presidential elections in November 2024 to catalyze change. This document assesses the potential risks, motivations, and implications of this planned action for stakeholders within and outside Russia.

## Background

The discussion originates from a thread titled ***“Plan for Leading Russia Out of the Current Crisis,”*** posted on a darknet forum by a user named Leviathan. It outlines a comprehensive strategy inspired by historical precedents of peaceful resistance, suggesting a mass economic strike as a means to exert pressure on the government. The plan is set to coincide with a period perceived as opportune for action, given the upcoming U.S. elections and the current geopolitical climate.

## Strategic Overview of Thread

### Objectives

*   To initiate a nationwide strike on May 13, 2024, aiming to halt military production and economic activities.
*   To mobilize the population against Putin’s regime through non-violent means.
*   To exploit the strategic timing before the 2024 U.S. presidential elections to maximize impact.

### **Tactics**

*   Coordinated cessation of work across the nation, particularly targeting sectors critical to military support and economic stability.
*   Dissemination of the plan through various media outlets and social channels, despite anticipated challenges in rallying support under a strict police state.
*   Utilization of “Italian strike” tactics, where work is performed strictly by the rules to the point of halting productivity.

## Potential Risks and Threats

### **To the Russian Government**

*   Economic destabilization could lead to significant financial losses, particularly in military production and state-supported sectors.
*   Increased public dissent may challenge the regime’s legitimacy and control, especially if the strike gains substantial participation.

### **To Public Safety**

*   Although the plan advocates for peaceful protest, the potential for escalation into violence cannot be discounted, especially if met with governmental resistance.
*   Disruption of daily activities and essential services may result in public unrest and potential harm to civilians.

### **To International Relations**

*   The strike’s timing, ahead of the U.S. presidential elections, may influence Russia’s geopolitical posture and relationships, particularly if perceived as a window of vulnerability.
*   External support or perceived involvement in the mobilization efforts could strain diplomatic ties and escalate tensions.

## Intelligence Assessment

The planned nationwide strike represents a significant indicator of growing dissent within Russia, highlighting a strategic push towards challenging the current regime through organized, non-violent resistance. While the movement’s success is contingent on widespread support and the ability to circumvent state surveillance and suppression, it underscores a critical juncture in Russia’s socio-political landscape.

### **Recommendations**

*   **For Government and Law Enforcement:** Monitor developments closely, with a focus on identifying peaceful protest intentions and distinguishing them from any violent escalations. Employ de-escalation tactics to manage public gatherings.
*   **For International Stakeholders:** Observe the situation for potential impacts on diplomatic relations and prepare for shifts in Russia’s internal and external policies.
*   **For Businesses:** Develop contingency plans for operations in Russia around May 2024, considering potential disruptions. Prioritize the safety of employees and ensure clear communication channels for crisis management.

## Conclusion

The discussed May 2024 strike plan, surfaced in a darknet forum, suggests an attempt at civil mobilization against Putin’s regime. Currently, this information is assessed with low to medium confidence as a serious movement, primarily due to the lack of corroboration from other sources or visible rallying around this cause beyond the initial posting. While the precise outcome of such an initiative remains highly uncertain, the post itself could be indicative of simmering tensions and a segment of the population’s willingness to explore collective action for change. Given the opaque nature of the source and the forum’s environment, stakeholders are advised to maintain vigilance and prepare for various potential developments, keeping in mind the preliminary status of these discussions as the situation continues to evolve.
