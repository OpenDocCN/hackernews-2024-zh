- en: The rate at which the Universe is expanding, known as the Hubble constant, is
    one of the fundamental parameters for understanding the evolution and ultimate
    fate of the cosmos. However, a persistent difference, called the Hubble Tension,
    is seen between the value of the constant measured with a wide range of independent
    distance indicators and its value predicted from the afterglow of the Big Bang.
    The NASA/ESA/CSA James Webb Space Telescope has confirmed that the Hubble Space
    Telescope’s keen eye was right all along, erasing any lingering doubt about Hubble’s
    measurements.

- en: One of the scientific justifications for building the NASA/ESA [Hubble Space
    Telescope](/Science_Exploration/Space_Science/Hubble_overview) was to use its
    observing power to provide an exact value for the expansion rate of the Universe.
    Prior to Hubble’s launch in 1990, observations from ground-based telescopes yielded
    huge uncertainties. Depending on the values deduced for the expansion rate, the
    Universe could be anywhere between 10 and 20 billion years old. Over the past
    34 years Hubble has shrunk this measurement to an accuracy of less than one percent,
    splitting the difference with an age value of 13.8 billion years. This has been
    accomplished by refining the so-called ‘cosmic distance ladder’ by measuring important
    milepost markers known as Cepheid variable stars.

    that the Universe was expanding faster after the Big Bang. These observations
    were made by the ESA Planck satellite’s mapping of the cosmic microwave background
    radiation – a blueprint for how the Universe would evolve structure after it cooled
    down from the Big Bang.

- en: The simple solution to the dilemma would be to say that maybe the Hubble observations
    are wrong, as a result of some inaccuracy creeping into its measurements of the
    deep-space yardsticks. Then along came the [James Webb Space Telescope](/Science_Exploration/Space_Science/Webb),
    enabling astronomers to crosscheck Hubble’s results. Webb’s infrared views of
    Cepheids agreed with Hubble’s optical-light data. Webb confirmed that the Hubble
    telescope’s keen eye was right all along, erasing any lingering doubt about Hubble’s
    measurements.

    the nearby Universe compared to the early Universe’s expansion remains a nagging
    puzzle for cosmologists. There may be something woven into the fabric of space
    that we don’t yet understand.

    that we have misunderstood the Universe,” said Adam Riess, a physicist at Johns
    Hopkins University in Baltimore. Adam holds a Nobel Prize for co-discovering the
    fact that the Universe’s expansion is accelerating, owing to a mysterious phenomenon
    now called ‘dark energy’.

- en: As a crosscheck, an initial Webb observation in 2023 confirmed that Hubble’s
    measurements of the expanding Universe were accurate. However, hoping to relieve
    the Hubble Tension, some scientists speculated that unseen errors in the measurement
    may grow and become visible as we look deeper into the Universe. In particular,
    stellar crowding could affect brightness measurements of more distant stars in
    a systematic way.

    cosmic milepost markers, known as Cepheid variable stars, which can now be correlated
    with the Hubble data.

    depending upon the object being observed. Collectively these techniques are known
    as the cosmic distance ladder – each rung or measurement technique relies upon
    the previous step for calibration.

- en: But some astronomers suggested that, moving outward along the ‘second rung’,
    the cosmic distance ladder might get shaky if the Cepheid measurements become
    less accurate with distance. Such inaccuracies could occur because the light of
    a Cepheid could blend with that of an adjacent star – an effect that could become
    more pronounced with distance as stars crowd together on the sky and become harder
    to distinguish from one another.

- en: The observational challenge is that past Hubble images of these more distant
    Cepheid variables look more huddled and overlapping with neighbouring stars at
    ever greater distances between us and their host galaxies, requiring careful accounting
    for this effect. Intervening dust further complicates the certainty of the measurements
    in visible light. Webb slices through the dust and naturally isolates the Cepheids
    from neighbouring stars because its vision is sharper than Hubble’s at infrared
    wavelengths.

    containing a total of 1000 Cepheids, and reach out to the farthest galaxy where
    Cepheids have been well measured – NGC 5468, at a distance of 130 million light-years. “This
    spans the full range where we made measurements with Hubble. So, we’ve gone to
    the end of the second rung of the cosmic distance ladder,” said co-author Gagandeep
    Anand of the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore, which operates the
    Webb and Hubble Telescopes for NASA.

    firmly set an anchor point on one shoreline of a river, and the afterglow of the
    Big Bang observed by Planck from the beginning of the Universe is set firmly on
    the other side. How the Universe’s expansion was changing in the billions of years
    between these two endpoints has yet to be directly observed. “We need to find
    out if we are missing something on how to connect the beginning of the Universe
    and the present day,” said Adam.
