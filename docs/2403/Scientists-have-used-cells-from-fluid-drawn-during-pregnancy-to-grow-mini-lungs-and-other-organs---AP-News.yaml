    a fetus in the womb – an advance they believe could open up new areas of prenatal

    are tiny simplified structures that can be used to test new medical treatments
    or study how the real organs they mimic work, whether they are healthy or diseased.

    in the United Kingdom collected cells from amniotic fluid samples taken during
    12 pregnancies as part of routine prenatal testing. Then, for the first time,
    they grew mini-organs from cells taken during active pregnancies. They envision
    their approach could eventually help doctors monitor and treat congenital conditions
    before birth and develop personalized therapies for a baby in the womb.

    by the fetus, as normally happens during pregnancy. The scientists identified
    which tissues the stem cells came from, and found cells from the lungs, kidneys
    and intestines.

    closely resemble adult tissue](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10192887/),
    or fetal tissue after an abortion.

    cells directly from fetal tissue, allowing these scientists to get cells from
    fetuses into the latter part of pregnancy. In the U.K., the legal limit for terminating
    a pregnancy is generally 22 weeks after conception. Scientists can’t get fetal
    samples after that, limiting their ability to study normal human development or
    congenital diseases past that point.

    fetal tissue for research, said Alta Charo, an emeritus professor of law and bioethics
    at the University of Wisconsin at Madison. Fetal tissue is [defined by the National
    Institutes of Health](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/policy/nihgps/html5/section_4/4.1.14_human_fetal_tissue_research.htm#:~:text=Human%20fetal%20tissue%20is%20defined,or%20induced%20abortion%20or%20stillbirth.)
    as coming from a dead human embryo or fetus after a miscarriage, abortion or stillbirth
    – and the use of tissue from an abortion has long been controversial.

    the same ethical issues. “Obtaining cells from amniotic fluid that is already
    being sampled for standard clinical purposes does not appear to add any physical
    risks to either fetus or pregnant woman,” she said in an email.

    at the University of California, San Francisco, and also wasn’t involved in the
    research, said getting cells this way has “the potential of giving you some information
    about that individual fetus as it’s growing.”

    6 weeks, Gerli said, there’s enough time for prenatal therapy to fix problems
    doctors might find.

    in Belgium to study the development of babies with a condition called a congenital
    diaphragmatic hernia, in which organs such as the liver and intestines get displaced
    into the chest because of a hole in the diaphragm. The lungs don’t develop the
    way they should, and about 30% of fetuses with the condition die. If doctors detect
    the hernia, they can operate on the fetus while it’s still in the womb.

    before and after treatment and compared them to organoids from healthy fetuses.
    Dr. Paolo de Coppi, an author of the study from University College London and
    Great Ormond Street Hospital, said they were able to assess the affected child’s
    condition before birth using this method. Doctors are now unable to tell families
    much about the outcome of a prenatal diagnosis because each case is different,
    he said. The ability to study functioning prenatal miniorgans, he added, is the
    first step toward a more detailed prognosis and more effective treatments.
