- en: Due to incorrect information provided by Getty Images, an earlier version of
    this column incorrectly used a photo depicting a French nuclear test at Fangataufa
    Atoll in 1970 rather than the U.S. test at Bikini Atoll in 1954\. The column has
    been updated to remove the incorrect image.
