    Or, to be more precise, it's Android. According to the Irish analysis site Statcounter's
    most recent numbers, [Android had 43.74% of the market in February 2024](https://gs.statcounter.com/os-market-share),
    followed by Windows with 27.39%. On the desktop, as it's been for decades, Windows
    is still the champ. Recently, though, [desktop Linux has crawled up to 4.03%](https://gs.statcounter.com/os-market-share/desktop/worldwide).

    is even more popular. Mind you, modern Chromebooks's ChromeOS owes more to the
    open-source, real-time operating system Zephyr than it does Linux.

    MacOS comes in a distant second at 15.46%, it's clear that Linux is making progress.
    Below I'll go over the five reasons why I think it's growing but first let's look
    at the headwinds.

    distributions, there are over 200 Linux distributions. On those, you'll find over
    [21 different desktop interfaces](https://www.theregister.com/2022/05/17/linux_desktop_feature/).
    There are more than half a dozen different package managers to install software
    on Linux. These include [Debian Package Management System](https://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/debian-reference/ch02.en.html)
    (DPKG), [Red Hat Package Manager](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/5/html/deployment_guide/ch-rpm)
    (RPM), [Pacman](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Pacman), [Zypper](https://en.opensuse.org/Portal:Zypper),
    and more besides. In addition to those, there are newer containerized package
    managers such as [Flatpak](https://flatpak.org/), [Snap](https://snapcraft.io/),
    and [AppImage](https://appimage.org/).

    about it. They can't do it. I wouldn't expect them to.

    and SUSE -- don't make the Linux desktop a priority. Of course, they have desktops.
    Canonical and Red Hat, in particular, also strongly influence the look and feel
    of the Linux desktop, but the desktop isn't their priority. Why would it be? They
    make their money from servers, containers, the cloud, and the Internet of Things.

    profits these days come from its Azure cloud and Software-as-a-Service (SaaS),
    Microsoft 365 in particular. Microsoft doesn't want you to buy Windows; the Redmond
    powerhouse wants you [to subscribe to Windows 365 Cloud PC](https://www.computerworld.com/article/3656694/we-re-one-step-closer-to-windows-in-the-cloud.html).

    growing group. I suspect that's because Steam, the most popular Linux gaming platform,
    also has the lion's share of the gaming distribution market

    want to do is work and play, [many Linux distributions are suitable for beginners](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-linux-desktops-for-beginners/).

    such as Flatpak, Snap, and AppImage, developers love them. Why? They make it simple
    to write applications for Linux that don't need to be tuned just right for all
    the numerous Linux distributions. For users, that means they get more programs
    to choose from, and they don't need to worry about finicky installation details.

    know what else is growing in India? Desktop Linux. In India, Windows is still
