    experience was so terrifying that even back at home they can’t shake the feeling
    that guerillas might pop out from behind the bushes. The rape victim who feels

    direction. Of course, the psychologists had designed the studies to be about equally
    good, and even switched the conclusion of each study from subject to subject to
    average out any remaining real difference in study quality. At the end of reading
    the two studies, both the liberal and conservative groups reported believing that

    - discussion of "dog whistles". This is the theory that sometimes politicians
    say things whose literal meaning is completely innocuous, but which secretly convey
    reprehensible views, in a way other people with those reprehensible views can
    detect and appreciate. For example, in the 2016 election, Ted Cruz said he was
    against Hillary Clinton's "New York values". This sounded innocent - sure, people
    from the Heartland think big cities have a screwed-up moral compass. But [various](https://www.usnews.com/opinion/articles/2016-04-08/does-ted-cruzs-new-york-values-comment-convey-anti-semitism)
    [news](http://talkingpointsmemo.com/livewire/jeffrey-toobin-new-york-values-anti-semitic-cruz)
    [sources](https://newrepublic.com/minutes/129338/ted-cruz-confirms-new-york-values-code-jewish)
    argued it was actually Cruz's way of signaling support for anti-Semitism (because
    New York = Jews). Since then, almost anything any candidate from any party says
    has been accused of being a dog-whistle for something terrible - for example,
    apparently Joe Biden's comments about Black Lives Matter were dog-whistling his
    support for rioters burning down American cities.

    - 例如，显然乔·拜登关于黑人生命至关重要的评论是在向支持暴乱烧毁美国城市的人发出"狗哨"。
- en: Maybe this kind of thing is real sometimes. But think about how it interacts
    with a trapped prior. Whenever the party you don't like says something seemingly
    reasonable, you can interpret in context as them wanting something horrible. Whenever
    they want a seemingly desirable thing, you secretly know it means they want a
    horrible moral atrocity. If a Republican talks about "law and order", it doesn't
    mean they're concerned about the victims of violent crime, it means they want
    to lock up as many black people as possible to strike a blow for white supremacy.
    When a Democrat talks about "gay rights", it doesn't mean letting people marry
    the people they love, it means destroying the family so they can replace it with
    state control over your children. I've had arguments with people who believe that
    no pro-life conservative really cares about fetuses, they just want to punish
    women for being sluts by denying them control over their bodies. And I've had
    arguments with people who believe that no pro-lockdown liberal really cares about
    COVID deaths, they just like the government being able to force people to wear
    masks as a sign of submission. Once you're at the point where all these things
    sound plausible, *you are doomed*. You can get a piece of evidence as neutral
    as "there's a deadly pandemic, so those people think you should wear a mask" and
    convert it into "they're trying to create an authoritarian dictatorship". And
    if someone calls you on it, you'll just tell them they need to look at it *in
    context*. It’s the bitch eating cracker syndrome except for politics - even when
    the other party does something completely neutral, it seems like extra reason
    to hate them.

  zh: 或许有时这种事情是真实的。但要考虑它如何与困扰先验互动。每当你不喜欢的政党说出看似合理的事情时，你可以将其解释为他们想要实现可怕的事情。每当他们想要一个看似可取的东西时，你心里明白这意味着他们想要一个可怕的道德暴行。如果共和党人谈论“法律和秩序”，这并不意味着他们关心暴力犯罪的受害者，而是意味着他们想要封锁尽可能多的黑人，以支持白人至上主义。当民主党人谈论“同性恋权利”时，这并不意味着让人们嫁给他们爱的人，而是意味着摧毁家庭，以便他们能够用国家控制你的孩子取而代之。我与那些认为保守派支持生命的人其实并不真正关心胎儿的人争论过，他们只是想通过剥夺她们对自己身体的控制来惩罚女性的人。我也与那些认为支持封锁的自由派实际上并不关心COVID死亡人数的人争论过，他们只是喜欢政府能够强制人们戴口罩作为服从的象征。一旦你达到这种所有这些事情听起来都合理的地步，*你注定要失败*。你可以得到一个中立的证据，比如“有致命的流行病，所以那些人认为你应该戴口罩”，然后把它转化为“他们试图建立一个威权专政”。如果有人对此提出异议，你只会告诉他们他们需要“在上下文中”看待这件事。这就是政治版的“妒忌擦饼干综合症”，即使对方政党做了完全中立的事情，似乎也是额外讨厌他们的理由。
