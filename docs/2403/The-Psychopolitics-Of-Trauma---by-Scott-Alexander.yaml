    cause this kind of reaction. Other people have added their own. But if something
    you hear on TV makes you feel victimized and helpless, then sure, go ahead and
    call it traumatizing. If Trump’s election made you feel victimized and helpless,

    I got a few death threats, and I was told to attend a criticism session at a local

    intrusive recollections of the trauma, numbing and avoidance of stimuli associated
    with it, anxiety, hypervigilance, and other symptoms indicative of increased arousal.
    Many individuals re-create and repetitively relive the trauma in their present
    lives. These phenomena have been called reenactments. For example, it has been
    found that women who were sexually abused as children are more likely to be sexually
    or physically abused in their marriages. It has been noted that traumatized individuals
    seem to have an addiction to trauma. A number of researchers have observed that
    retraumatization and revictimization of people who have experienced trauma, especially
    trauma in childhood, are all too common phenomena.

    view of the world. Whenever she talks to me, it’s to tell me some new fact about
    rape that she recently learned or thought about. She seems to spend her time planning
    and debating interesting new governance structures that communities can use to
    prevent rape. While I think this is healthy (she is using her bad experience to
    potentially help others), it sometimes seems to go beyond that; I cannot imagine
    that most of her speculation ends in concrete changes to social norms. In any
    case, she certainly isn’t doing the “expected” victim behavior of meticulously
    avoiding all rape-related stimuli.

    experience is that the most traumatized transgender people don’t avoid ever thinking
    about transphobia. They obsess over it, and who is doing it, and what types there
    are, and let it consume their entire lives. Again, it’s admirable and understandable
    to care about an issue that affects you and other people. But if someone cared
    about their risk of getting bitten by spiders at that level, I would call them
    clinically arachnophobic.

    describe an “addiction to trauma”. The exact mechanism is vague. Some people say
    it’s endorphin release (the same postulated mechanism as exercise addiction, spicy
    food enjoyment, and some forms of masochism). Other people say it’s desire to
    gain control over the trauma, feel like you’re choosing it rather than being helplessly
    victimized. Still others say that it’s a wish that you can re-enact it but give
    it a better ending.

    “cancel culture” entered the national scene. But once it did, I found myself over-focusing
    on cancel culture stories, especially the most outrageous ones (“college students
    attack white yoga instructor for culturally appropriating ancient Indian practice!”)
    Looking back, I feel like the attractive aspect of this was bonding with other
    people who were outraged by the event, and getting to retell the story in a way
    that ended with “and everyone agreed the woke cancellation mob was in the wrong,
    and the students apologized to the yoga instructor, and she was reinstated and
    lived happily ever after.” Or, even if that didn’t happen, getting to retell it
    in a way that had moral clarity, where no reasonable person was on the side of
    the cancellers - even if things ended badly for the yoga instructor, I could tell
    it in a way that ended with “but she was clearly a misunderstood martyr, and this
    proves the rightness of the anti-woke cause.”

    -8 to 8\. Conservatives rated the pro-punishment study at about +2 and the anti-execution
    study as about -2; liberals gave an only slightly smaller difference the opposite
    direction. Of course, the psychologists had designed the studies to be about equally
    good, and even switched the conclusion of each study from subject to subject to
    average out any remaining real difference in study quality. At the end of reading
    the two studies, both the liberal and conservative groups reported believing that

    - discussion of "dog whistles". This is the theory that sometimes politicians
    say things whose literal meaning is completely innocuous, but which secretly convey
    reprehensible views, in a way other people with those reprehensible views can
    detect and appreciate. For example, in the 2016 election, Ted Cruz said he was
    against Hillary Clinton's "New York values". This sounded innocent - sure, people
    from the Heartland think big cities have a screwed-up moral compass. But [various](https://www.usnews.com/opinion/articles/2016-04-08/does-ted-cruzs-new-york-values-comment-convey-anti-semitism)
    [news](http://talkingpointsmemo.com/livewire/jeffrey-toobin-new-york-values-anti-semitic-cruz)
    [sources](https://newrepublic.com/minutes/129338/ted-cruz-confirms-new-york-values-code-jewish)
    argued it was actually Cruz's way of signaling support for anti-Semitism (because
    New York = Jews). Since then, almost anything any candidate from any party says
    has been accused of being a dog-whistle for something terrible - for example,
    apparently Joe Biden's comments about Black Lives Matter were dog-whistling his
    support for rioters burning down American cities.

    with a trapped prior. Whenever the party you don't like says something seemingly
    reasonable, you can interpret in context as them wanting something horrible. Whenever
    they want a seemingly desirable thing, you secretly know it means they want a
    horrible moral atrocity. If a Republican talks about "law and order", it doesn't
    mean they're concerned about the victims of violent crime, it means they want
    to lock up as many black people as possible to strike a blow for white supremacy.
    When a Democrat talks about "gay rights", it doesn't mean letting people marry
    the people they love, it means destroying the family so they can replace it with
    state control over your children. I've had arguments with people who believe that
    no pro-life conservative really cares about fetuses, they just want to punish
    women for being sluts by denying them control over their bodies. And I've had
    arguments with people who believe that no pro-lockdown liberal really cares about
    COVID deaths, they just like the government being able to force people to wear
    masks as a sign of submission. Once you're at the point where all these things
    sound plausible, *you are doomed*. You can get a piece of evidence as neutral
    as "there's a deadly pandemic, so those people think you should wear a mask" and
    convert it into "they're trying to create an authoritarian dictatorship". And
    if someone calls you on it, you'll just tell them they need to look at it *in
    context*. It’s the bitch eating cracker syndrome except for politics - even when
    the other party does something completely neutral, it seems like extra reason
    to hate them.

    with the explicit, confessed desire on both sides to “trigger” the other as much
    as possible, and you have a lot of very clever people all trying to maximize one
    another’s trauma levels. On the external level, that looks like weaving as strong
    a narrative of threat and persecution as possible and trying to hit people in
    their psychological weak points. On the internal level, it means making sure they
    replace their normal ability to update with a series of triggers that make them
    replace reality with pre-packaged stories about how the other side is innately
    evil and everything they do is for specific threatening and evil reasons. Once
