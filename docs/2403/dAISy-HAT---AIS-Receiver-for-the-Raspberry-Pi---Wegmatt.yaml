    and [embedded applications](http://mdbuoyproject.wixsite.com/default/single-post/2017/03/02/V3-Buoy-Introduction).
    This two channel marine AIS receiver works great with OpenCPN, Kplex and other
    software that accepts serial data input. It is also well suited for reporting
    local ship traffic to services like MarineTraffic.

    With a bit of soldering, advanced users can combine dAISy with a Bluetooth module
    to receive AIS on wireless devices, connect a data logger like [SparkFun OpenLog](https://github.com/sparkfun/OpenLog/wiki),
    or any other device that can process serial data.

- en: How dAISy compares
  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: With [our open source work](https://github.com/astuder/dAISy), we pioneered
    a new category of AIS receivers designed around the [SiLabs EZRadioPro](http://www.silabs.com/products/wireless/ezradiopro/pages/si4362.aspx)
    single chip radio IC. This architecture is instrumental for the very low price,
    small form factor and low power consumption. The trade-offs are longer acquisition
    time, lower sensitivity and less range than some traditional AIS receivers.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Field tests with conventional dual-channel AIS receivers showed, that under
    good conditions the dAISy HAT can be on par with some models (e.g. SmartRadio
    SR162) while still being outperformed by others (e.g. advanSEA RX-100). However
    dAISy clearly outperforms all sub-$100 receivers that we have tested so far (Quark-elec,
    MarineGadget).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Our observation is, that with a good antenna dAISy is well suited to monitor
    local ship traffic. If you need maximum performance and are willing to pay for
    it, go with a receiver from the established brands.
