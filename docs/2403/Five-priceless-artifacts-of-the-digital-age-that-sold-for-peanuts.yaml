    was schooled in mathematics from an early age because her mother feared that she
    might grow up to be like her father, the literary giant, Lord Byron. Byron was
    one of history''s most notorious high-achieving naughty boys, famously described
    by Lady Caroline Lamb as "mad, bad and dangerous to know." Dad''s genius shone
    through as Ada worked with Charles Babbage on the Difference and Analytical Engines,
    becoming the first person in history to recognise that computers had applications
    beyond pure calculation. When society reflects on its progress centuries from
    now, this paper will represent humanity''s first attempt at building a computer.
    It will also stand as iconic from a second angle, as her identity had to be hidden
    as "the translator" because she was female. Have a guess what this sold item sold
