    launched the Stamp Swap Out scheme, which meant they could be exchanged for barcoded
    ones.

    a Stamp Swap Out form online to be posted to you, visiting a local delivery office
    or calling customer services.

    have a unique barcode, which the Royal Mail says makes it more difficult for the
    stamps to be reproduced, this may not be the case.

    envelope had a box ticked with ‘counterfeit stamp’. Stamps are considered a ‘secure
    print item’ in a similar way to bank notes, which means it is a crime to knowingly
    reuse or sell used or fake stamps.

    of 103 she had received from the Royal Mail after exchanging £95.69 worth of nonbarcoded
    stamps through the Stamp Swap Out scheme.

    least £100 in penalties from just one sender.

    says she does not believe there is a criminal network of postal workers making
    money out of fake stamps, rather that either the machines used to scan the stamps
    at the sorting offices or the printers that manufacture the stamps are faulty.
