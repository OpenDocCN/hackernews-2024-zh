    Center (PARC) to view a demonstration of an experimental personal computer called

    world when they became the heart of Apple’s Lisa and Macintosh computers.

    the lab to SRI International, an independent research laboratory that is a nonprofit
    organization with an equally storied history that has also fallen from its peak
    of influence. (The organization shortened its name this year to SRI. It used to
    be the Stanford Research Institute and was separated from the university in 1970\.
    It changed its name to SRI International in 1977.)
