# How the Brexit dream of Singapore-on-Thames was lost

What on earth happened? Why has the spirit of national renewal that Brexit was meant to give rise to fallen so woefully short?

According to Liz Truss, the former prime minister, it’s all down to the “deep state”, a suffocating conspiracy of bureaucrats and quangos that is determined to thwart the noble ambitions of elected politicians such as herself. Truss, by the way, campaigned for Remain, but then there is no zealot quite like the convert.

There may be some element of truth in what she says about Whitehall obstinacy and the shortcomings of [non elected technocrats](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2024/02/21/civil-service-union-shorter-week-same-pay/), but her take on events is essentially just a lot of paranoid nonsense straight out of the populist playbook, where an imaginary “enemy within” is created as a hate plank to channel the discontents of voters.

It was up to Brexit’s political cheerleaders to make something out of Britain’s decision to leave the European Union, whatever the obstacles, but they failed. They over promised and under delivered, and the presiding government is now about to reap the whirlwind.

This was not because the bureaucrats betrayed them, or even the rather more credible excuse of the pandemic; it was because the vision of Singapore-on-Thames was always a fantasy that would never be capable of uniting the nation behind it.

Everyone wants low taxes, but on the whole they also want top drawer public services, a credible military, a free at the point of use National Health Service, and [triple-locked state pensions](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/money/pensions/state-pensions/jeremy-hunt-triple-lock-boost-one-of-the-largest-ever/).

When Liz Truss attempted to square the circle with unfunded tax cuts while at the same time launching an unprecedented package of “big state” energy subsidies, it predictably ended in tears.

She was right about planning reform, and right about some of the other building blocks needed to create a functioning enterprise economy. But you cannot defy gravity; her plans were never going to pass muster with markets.

It’s odd that she seeks to blame the Office for Budget Responsibility for the crisis that erupted, because she had in fact dispensed with its services. Markets drew the obvious conclusion – that the OBR would never have weathered her fiscal incontinence.
