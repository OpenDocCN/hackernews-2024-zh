    Dynamics files, make it clear that the company did not inform security officials
    about discrepancies or difficulties in Veliotis` background. Even after General
    Dynamics officials knew he was under criminal investigation on Feb. 5, 1982, the
    Senate investigators could find no record that they informed security officials.

    to put Veliotis and his team of Canadians into their assignments. It accepted
    a downgrading of the security clearance of its entire Quincy, Mass., shipyard
    when Veliotis initially could not get a top-secret clearance. In 1977, General
    Dynamics was facing crippling management and production problems at Electric Boat
    at the same time it was trying to get the Navy to pay $534 million in claims for
    cost over-runs on the Los Angeles-class attack subs. Lewis had become convinced
    that Veliotis could correct the problems and he was backed by Lester Crown, the
    company`s largest shareholder.

    Veliotis was more fit to take this post than dozens of American candidates from
    throughout the country.

    early as 1973, William Pedace, nuclear engineering and design assistant, told
    a meeting of company officials that Adm. Rickover, the czar over all nuclear construction
    in the Navy, would vehemently oppose granting the clearance to a foreigner.

    into the job at Electric Boat, Pedace bought and delivered to Rickover a set of
    diamond earrings and a jade pendant valued at $1,625 for the admiral`s wife. The
    gifts were given on the instructions of Gordon MacDonald, General Dynamics executive
    vice president.
