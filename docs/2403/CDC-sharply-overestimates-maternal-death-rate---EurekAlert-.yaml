    of faulty surveillance techniques, according to an analysis by researchers at
    Rutgers Health and other universities.

- en: The National Vital Statistics System (NVSS) of the Centers for Disease Control
    and Prevention (CDC) estimates that maternal death rates have more than tripled
    over the last two decades to 32.9 deaths per 100,000 live births in 2021 – substantially
    more than in any other wealthy nation.

    published in *The American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology* reports consistent
    death rates of slightly more than 10 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births –
    well in line with international peers.

    thereafter from conditions directly related to or exacerbated by pregnancy or
    birth. Accidental deaths and those unrelated to the deceased’s pregnancy or recent
    delivery shouldn’t affect the maternal death rate. Yet, according to the authors
    of the new study, faulty NVSS methodology means such unrelated deaths often get
    counted as maternal deaths.

    numbers, but their efforts to correct those errors haven’t worked,” said [Cande

    Chief of the Division of Epidemiology and Biostatistics in the Department of Obstetrics,

    and senior author of the study.

    between 2018 and 2021, which clearly hasn’t happened. Still, many media outlets
    have reported these figures as correct, and it’s important to set the record straight,”
    Ananth added. “Accurate numbers are important to know where we stand and how we
    need to allocate money and effort to make improvements going forward.”

    period have pushed death rates down, while deteriorations in underlying patient
    health have almost perfectly offset those gains and kept the overall death rate
    stable.

- en: Estimates of maternal death rates began to rise in 2003 when a pregnancy check
    box first appeared on U.S. death certificates. Nearly any death certificate with
    a positive pregnancy checkbox added to maternal mortality rates, Ananth said,
    even when [factors such as the dead woman being over 85 years old](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr69/nvsr69-02-508.pdf)
    (or biologically male) cast doubt on the certificate’s accuracy. As a result of
    these errors, the CDC stopped reporting maternal death rates in the United States
    between 2007 and 2017.

    its use to women aged 15 to 44\. However, the NVSS still misclassifies the deaths
    of many non-maternal and incidental deaths as maternal deaths.

    said. “A big change driving recent increases in the official numbers stems from
    the tendency to include more and more cancers unrelated to pregnancy in maternal
    death rates. A woman who had a diagnosis of breast cancer before conception and
    then died after the pregnancy ended or – a woman who would have died if she’d
    never gotten pregnant – will be counted as a maternal death.”

    to 2002 and 2018 to 2021 in two different ways. First, they used the NVSS’s stated
    methodology and got numbers that virtually matched the official published ones.
    Second, they restricted maternal deaths to those where pregnancy appeared at least
    once amid the causes of death on the death certificate.

    the 1999-2002 period and 23.6 in the 2018-2021 period, while the alternative method
    calculated death rates of 10.2 and 10.4 per 100,000 live births, respectively.
    These startling statistics discount the previously held belief that the United
    States maternal death rates have been increasing. Fortunately, that is not so,
    said Ananth.

    the researchers found evidence that health care during pregnancy and after delivery
    has improved substantially in many areas. There was a significant reduction in
    maternal deaths because of infection, hypertensive disorders in pregnancy such
    as preeclampsia or eclampsia and other treatable causes.

    race, though significant differences remain. Hispanic women had the lowest death
    rate, 7.46 per 100,000 live births, while Black women had the highest, 23.8 per
    100,000 live births in 2018-2021.

    methodology, showed stable rates of maternal mortality and a reduction in deaths
    from obstetrical complications,” said K. S. Joseph, lead author of the new study
    and a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the University of British Columbia,
    Canada. “Moreover, the analysis by cause-of-death provides evidence that can enable
    focused prevention initiatives targeted at high-risk and vulnerable subpopulations.”
