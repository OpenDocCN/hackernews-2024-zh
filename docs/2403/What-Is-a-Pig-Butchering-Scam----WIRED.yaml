- en: Though carrying off pig butchering scams takes a lot of communication and relationship
    building with victims over time, researchers say that crime syndicates in China
    developed scripts and playbooks that allowed them to offload the work at scale
    onto inexperienced scammers or even forced laborers who are [victims of human
    trafficking](https://www.vice.com/en/article/n7zb5d/pig-butchering-scam-cambodia-trafficking).

    forced laborers,” says Michael Roberts, founder of Rexxfield Cyber Investigations,
    who has been working with victims of pig butchering attacks. “That’s why we need
    to start educating people about this threat so we can disrupt the cycle and reduce
    the demand for these kidnappings and forced labor.”

    which law enforcement encourages victims not to pay hackers’ ransom demands so
    they will be disincentivized to keep trying.

    2021, the FBI’s Internet Crime Complaint Center [received](https://www.ic3.gov/Media/PDF/AnnualReport/2021_IC3Report.pdf)
    more than 4,300 submissions related to pig butchering scams, totaling more than
    $429 million in losses. And at the end of November, the US Department of Justice
    [announced](https://www.justice.gov/usao-edva/pr/court-authorizes-seizure-domains-used-furtherance-cryptocurrency-pig-butchering-scheme)
    that it had seized seven domain names used in pig butchering scams in 2022.

    entice victims to make purported investments in cryptocurrency providing fictitious
    returns to encourage additional investments,” the FBI [said](https://www.ic3.gov/Media/Y2022/PSA221003)
    in an October alert.

    component of helping people avoid becoming the victim of a pig butchering scheme.
    If people know the telltale signs and understand the concepts underlying the scams,
    they are less likely to be ensnared. The challenge, they say, is reaching the
    wider public and getting people who learn about pig butchering to pass on the
    information to others in their families and social circles.

    say that pig butchering scams take an enormous psychological toll on victims in
    addition to their financial toll. And the [use of forced labor](https://www.propublica.org/article/human-traffickers-force-victims-into-cyberscamming)
    to carry out pig butchering schemes adds yet another layer of trauma and creates
    even more urgency to addressing the threat.
