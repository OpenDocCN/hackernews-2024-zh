- en: To attract new talent, employers often offer new hires higher wages than existing
    employees. But today, a combination of regulatory changes and technological advances
    have dramatically increased pay transparency in many sectors, making employees
    increasingly aware of these pay disparities. How do existing employees (and especially
    top performers) react to these higher-paid new hires? And how can organizations
    mitigate the associated risks? The authors’ recent research shows that unless
    employers adjust existing employees’ wages soon after making a new hire, employees
    tend to resign — and that top performers tend to resign faster than others. As
    such, employers should be aware of the impact hiring higher-paid external talent
    can have on their teams, conduct regular pay equity analyses to ensure that any
    disparities are fully explainable, and develop the agility necessary to adjust
    wages as soon as any inequities are identified.
