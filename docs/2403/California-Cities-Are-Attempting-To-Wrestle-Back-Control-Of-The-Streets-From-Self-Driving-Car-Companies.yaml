    permits in the Golden State: the California Department of Motor Vehicles and the
    California Public Utilities Commission. Both continue to approve expanding robotaxi
    operations in Los Angeles and San Francisco. Cities, and their citizens, have
    had to just put up with their streets being turned into science experiments for
    private companies. But a new bill under consideration in California’s senate would
