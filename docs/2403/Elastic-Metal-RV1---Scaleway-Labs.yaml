- en: An NPU, or Neural Processing Unit, is a specialized chip designed to perform
    information processing operations based on neural models or artificial neural
    networks. These chips are optimized for accelerating tasks related to machine
    learning, natural language processing, computer vision and other tasks associated
    with artificial intelligence.

- en: Unlike traditional processors that execute sequential instructions, NPUs are
    specifically designed to simultaneously handle large amounts of data and perform
    massively parallel calculations, making them particularly effective for tasks
    related to deep learning and deep neural networks.

- en: NPUs are widely used in applications such as speech recognition, image classification,
    machine translation, object detection, sequence prediction and many other fields
    where massive and complex data processing is required. They help speed up these
    tasks and improve the performance of artificial intelligence systems, both in
    terms of processing speed and energy efficiency.
