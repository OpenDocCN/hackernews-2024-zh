    reveals some good news. No fatal accidents and no hull losses were recorded in
    commercial aviation last year even though air traffic increased by 20% compared
    to 2022, reaching more than 32 million flights.

    huge improvements in safety over recent decades. It also underlines how technology
    contributes to improving safety when taking a flight in a commercial jet aircraft.

- en: The safety record for 2023 is a good result. However, it is important to remember
    that statistics for one year are not always indicative of the overall safety trends.
    This analysis uses accident rates calculated as a 10-year moving average to provide
    a more consistent trend.

- en: 'Safety is a never-ending effort and preventing accidents is a constant quest
    for all those involved. This is why the runway collision between an A350 and a
    Dash-8 turboprop aircraft that occurred on 2 January 2024 in Tokyo, which claimed
    the lives of 5 people on board the Dash-8, is also mentioned in this 2023 edition.
    It is a stark reminder: we need to avoid the trap of complacency and remain vigilant
    in the reinforcement of all safety barriers to prevent accidents.'
