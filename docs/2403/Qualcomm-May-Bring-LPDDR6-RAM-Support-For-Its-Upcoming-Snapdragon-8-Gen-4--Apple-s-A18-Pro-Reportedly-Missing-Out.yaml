    A18 Pro Reportedly Missing Out

- en: LPDDR6 will reportedly be [finalized later this year](https://wccftech.com/lpddr6-memory-power-next-gen-devices-jedec-finalize-standard-q3-2024/),
    hinting that several phone manufacturers, including the likes of Qualcomm, MediaTek,
    and Apple, will integrate this technology in their future handsets. However, a
    rumor doing the rounds states that the upcoming Snapdragon 8 Gen 4 will be ahead
    of all its competitors as it will obtain support for this next-generation memory.
    In contrast, Apple’s A18 Pro, which will exclusively be mass produced for the
    iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max, could miss out on this opportunity.

    and jump straight towards LPDDR6 support

- en: Demand for faster and more efficient memory will soon become commonplace amongst
    smartphone and chipset makers, allowing them to run extensive on-device AI models.
    An earlier report estimated that future handsets would [require at least 20GB
    RAM](https://wccftech.com/android-smartphones-with-on-device-ai-are-going-to-need-a-lot-of-ram-to-properly-deliver-the-functionality/)
    to run these models, with LPDDR6 likely delivering an increased bandwidth so that
    it does not create a performance bottleneck. In this regard, Ajnews reports that
    Qualcomm will be aiming to get the better of its rivals, such as Apple because
    its Snapdragon 8 Gen 4 might arrive with LPDDR6 support.

- en: This may be possible because the company’s Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 is validated for
    LPDDR5T, just like the Dimensity 9300, though it is up to the smartphone manufacturers
    to source this memory to use in their devices. Back in November last year, SK
    hynix announced that it would be shipping the [first batch of LPDDR5T memory chips
    for smartphones](https://wccftech.com/sk-hynix-begins-shipping-lpddr5t-dram-for-smartphones/)
    that featured the Dimensity 9300\. The Vivo X100 Pro was rumored to be treated
    to this cutting-edge technology, but it is still listed as featuring the older
    LPDDR5X RAM on its specifications page.

- en: In short, it is possible for the Snapdragon 8 Gen 4 to obtain support for LPDDR6,
    but it will be up to Qualcomm’s partners to make the final call. As for Apple,
    the technology giant is known for adopting the newest standards much later than
    the competition, so, unsurprisingly, the A18 Pro will not support LPDDR6 RAM.
    While this can mean that the iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max may not be able
    to run on-device Large Language Models (LLMs) more efficiently, Apple is said
    to be exploring [storing LLMs on NAND flash](https://wccftech.com/apple-exploring-llm-on-flash-storage-bring-technology-to-phones-laptops/),
    meaning that theoretically, devices with limited RAM capacity can support on-device
    AI.

  zh: 简而言之，骁龙 8 代 4 可能会获得对 LPDDR6 的支持，但最终决定将取决于高通的合作伙伴。至于苹果，这家科技巨头以晚于竞争对手采纳最新标准而闻名，因此毫不奇怪的是，A18
    Pro 不会支持 LPDDR6 RAM。虽然这可能意味着 iPhone 16 Pro 和 iPhone 16 Pro Max 不能更有效地运行设备上的大型语言模型（LLM），据称苹果正在探索将
    [LLM 存储在 NAND 闪存](https://wccftech.com/apple-exploring-llm-on-flash-storage-bring-technology-to-phones-laptops/)
    上，这意味着理论上，内存容量有限的设备也能支持设备上的 AI。
- en: The maximum bandwidth of LPDDR6 has yet to be discussed, but given that LPDDR5T
    has maximum operating speeds of 9.6Gbps, we can immediately assume that the next-generation
    will be faster. As for when we will see it in action, the report states that this
    technology will be adopted in the second half of 2025, so let us keep our fingers
    crossed.

  zh: 尽管 LPDDR6 的最大带宽尚未讨论，但鉴于 LPDDR5T 的最大运行速度达到 9.6Gbps，我们可以立即假设下一代将会更快。关于何时能够见到它实际应用的问题，报告指出这项技术将在
    2025 年下半年被采用，所以让我们拭目以待。
