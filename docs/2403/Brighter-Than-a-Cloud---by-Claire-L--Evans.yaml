- en: How to describe a scintillating scotoma? It’s one of the most common symptoms
    of a migraine, but unless you’ve had one, it sounds unreal. A scintillating scotoma
    is like a barbed ripple in the pool of sight. It’s a skeletal Magic Eye raised
    up from the flatness of the world. It’s a glare on the tarmac as you drive West
    at sunset on a rain-slick freeway—only when you turn your head, it’s still there,
    so you have to pull over, close your eyes, and wait out the slow-motion firework
    working its way across your brain.

- en: Medieval migraine sufferers compared the jagged shape of their scintillating
    scotoma to fortresses, and medical literature describes their “fortification patterns.”
    I never quite understood the analogy until I took a water tour of Copenhagen—as
    our boat slid down the Øresund alongside the island citadel of [Kastellet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kastellet,_Copenhagen),
    I saw my own scotoma in stone. A migraine aura, too, has ramparts and ravelins,
    bastions against a zig-zag world. At their edges, chaos reigns. The thin interface
    between a scotoma and normal vision is a boiling tar, a volley of arrows, a violence
    of inputs and light. In the midst of an attack, it’s tempting to think that perception
    is always at war with reality.

- en: In the absence of an organizing mind, everything comes unglued. Faces go missing
    and dark holes seem to eat half the universe. Migraine sufferers can experience
    the uncanny sense of consciousness doubling known as *déja-vu*, or its cousin,
    *jamais-vu,* in which the world feels newly-made. The world might feel suddenly
    very unreal, fracture into a mosaic, or slow to a stop-motion pace, dropping frames.
    The self might cleave in two in a fit of *somatopsychic duality*. Writing about
    these bizarre and horrifying perceptual phenomena, the late Oliver Sacks [observed](https://www.oliversacks.com/oliver-sacks-books/migraine/)
    that migraines “show us how the brain-mind constructs ‘space’ and ‘time,’ by demonstrating
    what happens when space and time are broken, or *unmade.”*

    As the scotoma’s shining edges recede across your field of vision, they trace
    a corresponding wave of electrical activity, a “spreading depression” crossing
    the cortex at 3 millimeters per minute. You can watch it happen in real time,
    as you might watch a cloud track across the sky on a windy day. You might even
    have time draw a picture of the scotoma as it passes overhead—a landscape en *pleine
    tête*.

- en: 'The Wellcome Collection, in London, hosts [a remarkable collection](https://wellcomecollection.org/works/caav4wtp)
    of such pictures: some 545 submissions to a British migraine art competition than
    ran throughout the 1980s. Each image has its own vernacular charm. The scotomas
    explode into tidy living rooms and block bucolic country roads. They dazzle a
    woman’s smile. They arc like ball lightning across the faces of row houses. The
    collection is worth appreciating on an aesthetic level alone, as sublime outsider
    art, but it’s valuable, also, because it reveals the scotoma’s universal form.
    Like dreams, migraines map terrain we all share.'

- en: Perceptual distortions are difficult to measure, but they can be approximated
    in paint and pencil, which makes migraine art a powerful diagnostic and scientific
    tool. The earliest depictions of migraine phenomena were illustrations made by
    physicians who happened to be *migraineurs* themselves, like the German ophthalmologist
    Christian Georg Theodor Ruete, who illustrated the three successive stages of
    his own “*flimmerskotom”* in 1845, and the [19th century British physician Hubert
    Airy](https://publicdomainreview.org/collection/visualizing-migraines/), whose
    ink renderings wouldn’t be out of place in the Wellcome’s migraine art collection.

- en: Nor, for that matter, would the illuminated manuscripts of the 12th-century
    German Christian mystic Hildegard of Bingen. Hildegard, who spent most of her
    childhood as an anchoress, enclosed in a one-room cell adjoining the Benedictine
    monastery at Disibodenberg, described lifelong gripping pain and a persistent
    *umbra viventis lucis:* a reflection of living light. “The light which I see…is
    not spatial, but it is far, far brighter than a cloud which carries the sun,”
    she wrote. Descriptions like these, supplemented by her [visionary artwork](https://www.arthistoryproject.com/artists/hildegard-von-bingen/book-of-divine-works-part-1-vision-3-macrocosm-of-winds-microcosm-of-humors/)
    depicting fortifications, mandalas of stars, flaming eyes, and openings in the
    sky lapped with white-crested waves, have led many neurologists to retroactively
    diagnose her as a chronic migraine sufferer.

    vast majority of people, can become, in a privileged consciousness, the substrate
    of a supreme ecstatic inspiration.”*'

    is non-denominational. Lewis Carroll transmuted his acute migraine symptoms—the
    visual disturbances of Lilliputian and Brobdignian vision*,* which made him feel
    as though his limbs were shrinking and growing away from him—into *Alice in Wonderland*.
    Giorgio de Chirico, who suffered from scotoma, depersonalization, *déja*- and
    *jamais-vu*, among other migraine symptoms, repeatedly painted wobbly suns, jagged
    voids, zig-zags and disproportionate figures into his metaphysical canvases.

    migraine auras are as old as humankind—so old, perhaps, that they may have inspired
    the geometric forms of Stone Age cave drawings. Which makes [recent attempts to
    generate migraine auras using convolutional neural networks](https://community.wolfram.com/groups/-/m/t/2575919)
    seem particularly poignant to me: what began in stone, animated by the hot flicker
    of firelight, continues 5,000 years later, deep in the heart of servers whose
    mineral components were mined from the same dark Earth.'
