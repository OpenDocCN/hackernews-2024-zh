- en: How to describe a scintillating scotoma? It’s one of the most common symptoms
    of a migraine, but unless you’ve had one, it sounds unreal. A scintillating scotoma
    is like a barbed ripple in the pool of sight. It’s a skeletal Magic Eye raised
    up from the flatness of the world. It’s a glare on the tarmac as you drive West
    at sunset on a rain-slick freeway—only when you turn your head, it’s still there,
    so you have to pull over, close your eyes, and wait out the slow-motion firework
    working its way across your brain.

  zh: 如何描述闪烁的斑岩？它是偏头痛最常见的症状之一，但除非你亲身经历过，否则听起来似乎不真实。闪烁的斑岩就像视野池中的带刺涟漪。它是从世界的平坦中凸显出来的骨架魔术眼。这是在雨后晚霞时分驾驶西行的高速公路上，路面上的眩光——只有当你转过头，它依然存在，所以你不得不靠边停车，闭上眼睛，等待这种缓慢的火花在你的大脑中扩散。
- en: Medieval migraine sufferers compared the jagged shape of their scintillating
    scotoma to fortresses, and medical literature describes their “fortification patterns.”
    I never quite understood the analogy until I took a water tour of Copenhagen—as
    our boat slid down the Øresund alongside the island citadel of [Kastellet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kastellet,_Copenhagen),
    I saw my own scotoma in stone. A migraine aura, too, has ramparts and ravelins,
    bastions against a zig-zag world. At their edges, chaos reigns. The thin interface
    between a scotoma and normal vision is a boiling tar, a volley of arrows, a violence
    of inputs and light. In the midst of an attack, it’s tempting to think that perception
    is always at war with reality.

  zh: 中世纪的偏头痛患者将他们闪烁的斑岩的锯齿状形状与堡垒相比，并且医学文献描述了它们的“防御模式”。我直到乘坐哥本哈根的水上游船游览时才能理解这个类比——当我们的船沿着厄勒海峡滑行时，我看到我自己的石头斑岩。偏头痛的光环也有城墙和护城河，对抗蜿蜒的世界。在它们的边缘，混乱笼罩。斑岩与正常视力之间薄薄的界面是沸腾的焦油，箭雨，信息和光的暴力。在一次攻击中，人们很容易认为感知始终在与现实作战。
- en: In the absence of an organizing mind, everything comes unglued. Faces go missing
    and dark holes seem to eat half the universe. Migraine sufferers can experience
    the uncanny sense of consciousness doubling known as *déja-vu*, or its cousin,
    *jamais-vu,* in which the world feels newly-made. The world might feel suddenly
    very unreal, fracture into a mosaic, or slow to a stop-motion pace, dropping frames.
    The self might cleave in two in a fit of *somatopsychic duality*. Writing about
    these bizarre and horrifying perceptual phenomena, the late Oliver Sacks [observed](https://www.oliversacks.com/oliver-sacks-books/migraine/)
    that migraines “show us how the brain-mind constructs ‘space’ and ‘time,’ by demonstrating
    what happens when space and time are broken, or *unmade.”*

    As the scotoma’s shining edges recede across your field of vision, they trace
    a corresponding wave of electrical activity, a “spreading depression” crossing
    the cortex at 3 millimeters per minute. You can watch it happen in real time,
    as you might watch a cloud track across the sky on a windy day. You might even
    have time draw a picture of the scotoma as it passes overhead—a landscape en *pleine

  zh: 做个不容置疑，偏头痛确实提供了对大脑及其奥秘的罕见视角。当视野中的斑岩边缘逐渐消退时，它们映射出相应的电活动波，一种“扩展性抑郁”以每分钟3毫米的速度横跨皮质。你可以实时观察到这一过程，就像在有风的日子里看云朵飘过天空一样。你甚至可能有时间在它经过头顶时画出斑岩的图景——一幅生动的头顶景象。

    of such pictures: some 545 submissions to a British migraine art competition than
    ran throughout the 1980s. Each image has its own vernacular charm. The scotomas
    explode into tidy living rooms and block bucolic country roads. They dazzle a
    woman’s smile. They arc like ball lightning across the faces of row houses. The
    collection is worth appreciating on an aesthetic level alone, as sublime outsider
    art, but it’s valuable, also, because it reveals the scotoma’s universal form.
    Like dreams, migraines map terrain we all share.'

    in paint and pencil, which makes migraine art a powerful diagnostic and scientific
    tool. The earliest depictions of migraine phenomena were illustrations made by
    physicians who happened to be *migraineurs* themselves, like the German ophthalmologist
    Christian Georg Theodor Ruete, who illustrated the three successive stages of
    his own “*flimmerskotom”* in 1845, and the [19th century British physician Hubert
    Airy](https://publicdomainreview.org/collection/visualizing-migraines/), whose
    ink renderings wouldn’t be out of place in the Wellcome’s migraine art collection.

    German Christian mystic Hildegard of Bingen. Hildegard, who spent most of her
    childhood as an anchoress, enclosed in a one-room cell adjoining the Benedictine
    monastery at Disibodenberg, described lifelong gripping pain and a persistent
    *umbra viventis lucis:* a reflection of living light. “The light which I see…is
    not spatial, but it is far, far brighter than a cloud which carries the sun,”
    she wrote. Descriptions like these, supplemented by her [visionary artwork](https://www.arthistoryproject.com/artists/hildegard-von-bingen/book-of-divine-works-part-1-vision-3-macrocosm-of-winds-microcosm-of-humors/)
    depicting fortifications, mandalas of stars, flaming eyes, and openings in the
    sky lapped with white-crested waves, have led many neurologists to retroactively
    diagnose her as a chronic migraine sufferer.
