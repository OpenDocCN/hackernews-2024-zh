- en: Since the initial version of the Speedometer benchmark was released in 2014
    by the WebKit team, it has become a key tool for browser engines to drive performance
    optimizations as users and developers continue to demand richer and smoother experiences
    online.

    the three major browser engines: Blink, Gecko, and WebKit. Like previous releases
    ([Speedometer 2 in 2018](https://webkit.org/blog/8063/speedometer-2-0-a-benchmark-for-modern-web-app-responsiveness/)
    and [Speedometer 1 in 2014](https://webkit.org/blog/3395/speedometer-benchmark-for-web-app-responsiveness/)),
    it’s designed to measure web application responsiveness by simulating user interactions
    on real web pages. Today’s release of Speedometer 3.0 marks a major step forward
    in web browser performance testing: it introduces a better way of measuring performance
    and a more representative set of tests that reflect the modern Web.'

- en: 'This is the first time the Speedometer benchmark, or any major browser benchmark,
    has been developed through a cross-industry collaboration supported by each major
    browser engine: Blink/V8, Gecko/SpiderMonkey, and WebKit/JavaScriptCore. It’s
    been developed under a new governance model, driven by consensus, and is hosted
    in a [shared repository](https://github.com/WebKit/Speedometer/) that’s open to
    contribution. This new structure involves a lot of collective effort: discussions,
    research, debates, decisions, and hundreds of PRs since we announced the project
    in December 2022\.'

    identifying some key scenarios and user interactions that we felt were important
    for browsers to optimize.
  prefs: []

- en: In particular, we added new tests that simulate rendering canvas and SVG charts
    (React Stockcharts, Chart.js, Perf Dashboard, and Observable Plot), code editing
    (CodeMirror), WYSIWYG editing (TipTap), and reading news sites (Next.js and Nuxt.js).

    common versions of the most popular frameworks based on data from the the HTTP
    Archive. The following frameworks and libraries are included: Angular, Backbone,
    jQuery, Lit, Preact, React, React+Redux, Svelte, and Vue; along with vanilla JavaScript
    implementations targeting ES5 and ES6, and a Web Components version. We also introduced
    more complex versions of these tests which are embedded into a bigger DOM tree
    with many complex CSS rules that more closely emulate the page weight and structure
    from popular webapps today.'

    of the engine, providing new opportunities to optimize JS, Layout, CSS, Graphics,
    and DOM APIs in order to improve user experience on the Web. Take a look at [this
    page](https://www.browserbench.org/Speedometer3.0/about.html) for more details
    about the tests themselves.

- en: The test runner itself in Speedometer 3 has been improved to measure more of
    the work the browser does in response to user actions, such as painting and asynchronous
    tasks. Speedometer 2.0 measured the time to run a test script synchronously as
    "sync" time, as well as any additional work before a 0 second timer fires as "async"
    time. However, this missed some work browser engines have to do to update the
    rendering of a web page.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In Speedometer 3.0, we are able to measure this previously-missing rendering
    work, which creates more opportunities to optimize real-world content. To do this,
    we measure a test script within a requestAnimationFrame callback as "sync" time,
    and a 0 second timer scheduled in a second requestAnimationFrame fires as "async"
    time. This async time is guaranteed to include work from timers in the test itself,
    as well as page rendering by the browser engine. These changes greatly improve
    the accuracy of the benchmark, and translate into real-world improvements for
    users as engines optimize this previously-missing work.

- en: There are some more behind the scenes improvements as well. There’s improved
    developer tooling so browser engineers can better understand results, profile,
    and customize the test. We redesigned the test runner architecture to make it
    easier to write and maintain complex test cases. And there are many code quality
    improvements and migrations to modern features that weren’t broadly available
    when Speedometer 2.0 was released, such as native promises, async / await, classes,
    and modules.

- en: The [primary goal](https://github.com/WebKit/Speedometer/?tab=readme-ov-file#what-is-speedometer)
    of Speedometer 3 is to reflect the real-world Web as much as possible, so that
    users benefit when a browser improves its score on the benchmark. It has already
    had some success at this before publicly launching, with core optimizations in
    each major engine throughout the last year turning into responsiveness improvements
    for users across the Web.
