- en: Midjourney says it has banned Stability AI staffers from using its service,
    accusing employees at the rival generative AI company of causing a systems outage
    earlier this month during an attempt to scrape Midjourney’s data.

- en: Midjourney posted an update to its Discord server on March 2nd that acknowledged
    an extended server outage was preventing generated images from appearing in user
    galleries. In a summary of a business update call on March 6th, Midjourney claimed
    that “botnet-like activity from paid accounts” — which the company specifically
    links to Stability AI employees — was behind the outage.

- en: According to Midjourney user [Nick St. Pierre on X](https://twitter.com/nickfloats/status/1765471291300045255),
    who listened to the call, Midjourney said that the service was brought down because
    “someone at Stability AI was trying to grab all the prompt and image pairs in
    the middle of a night on Saturday.” St. Pierre said that Midjourney had linked
    multiple paid accounts to an individual on the Stability AI data team.

    on March 6th (which Midjourney refers to as “office hours”), the company says
    it’s banning *all* Stability AI employees from using its service “indefinitely”
    in response to the outage. Midjourney is also introducing a new policy that will
    similarly ban employees of any company that exercises “aggressive automation”
    or causes outages to the service.

- en: St. Pierre [flagged the accusations](https://twitter.com/EMostaque/status/1765495422561206507)
    to Stability AI CEO Emad Mostaque, who replied on X, saying he was investigating
    the situation and that Stability hadn’t ordered the actions in question. “Very
    confusing how 2 accounts would do this team also hasn’t been scraping as we have
    been using synthetic & other data given SD3 outperforms all other models,” said
    Mostaque, referring to the Stable Diffusion 3 AI model [currently in preview](https://stability.ai/news/stable-diffusion-3).
    He claimed that if the outage *was* caused by a Stability employee, then it was
    unintentional and “obviously not a DDoS attack.”

    been provided since that conversation on March 6th. At the time of writing, neither
    Midjourney nor Stability AI have responded to the *Verge*’s request for comment.

- en: It does seem odd that scraping activity from just two accounts allegedly managed
    to cause such an extended server outage. The irony of this situation also [hasn’t
    been lost on online creatives](https://www.reddit.com/r/nottheonion/comments/1b9s75z/midjourney_accuses_stability_ai_of_image_theft/),
    who have extensively criticized both companies (and generative AI systems in general)
    for training their models on masses of online data scraped from their works without
    consent. Stable Diffusion and Midjourney [have both](/2023/1/16/23557098/generative-ai-art-copyright-legal-lawsuit-stable-diffusion-midjourney-deviantart)
    been targeted with [several copyright lawsuits](/2023/2/6/23587393/ai-art-copyright-lawsuit-getty-images-stable-diffusion),
    with the latter being accused of [creating an artist database for training purposes
    in December](https://twitter.com/JonLamArt/status/1741545927435784424).
