- en: '<content>Back when I was pursuing my Computer Science degree, one of the big
    questions that kept me busy was: what am I going to do after I graduate? I felt
    like I could work on pretty much anything, thanks to the solid foundations I received
    at the university and to my real-world experience contributing to Rust. So… what
    to choose?'

    I decided to start meeting people in order to answer my question. I reached out
    to friends of friends who were into programming, talked to random people on the
    internet, frequented local programming meetups and even organized my own. This
    experience shifted my focus: instead of trying to find a specific area of technology
    to *work in*, I started looking for the kind of people I’d like to *work with*.'

    to work for [Infi](https://infi.nl/), a boutique consultancy in Utrecht doing
    full-stack development for scale-ups. The first thing that drew me to the company
    was the atmosphere, which I jokingly described as a never-ending meetup. People
    were genuinely curious about computers^(, and I got to spend about 20% of my working
    time on personal development (ranging from side projects, to open source contributions,
    to doing a philosophy course out of the company’s pocket).)'

    enjoyed the challenge of learning the craft. This included the human side of things,
    like interfacing with stakeholders, working in an agile way that suited our team
    (not the dreaded top-down buzzword-driven farce), doing pair-programming sessions,
    helping new colleagues get up to speed, etc. It felt like the right place to work^(,
    even though my university and open source background had given me deeper technical
    roots than I was using on the job.)

    more time volunteering. You can find the full account of that change [here](https://ochagavia.nl/blog/becoming-a-contractor/),
    but the bottom line is that I became self-employed and started working on whatever
    projects I could find.

    happened: a company in San Francisco hired me to [implement the MySQL wire protocol](https://ochagavia.nl/blog/implementing-the-mysql-server-protocol-for-fun-and-profit/)!
    For the first time in my life I got paid to use my technical skills in full. I
    researched the intricacies of an underdocumented network protocol, came up with
    a robust implementation, and exposed it as a hard-to-misuse library.'

    reserved for a few lucky people. In fact, after this project things went back
    to “normal” development work, though this time with a stronger focus on the backend.

    attention of [Prefix.dev](https://prefix.dev), who develop programmer tooling
    for the Conda ecosystem. They hired me to [explore the rabbit hole of containers](https://ochagavia.nl/blog/crafting-container-images-without-dockerfiles/),
    [boost development of their open source libraries](https://ochagavia.nl/blog/the-birth-of-a-package-manager/)

    [systems programmer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_programming). I still
    do full-stack development once in a while, mostly as a hobby. I like the way you
    can make end-users happy with something simple. It also allows me to scratch my
    own itch and wrap the resulting programs in a pleasant interface. More importantly,
    it lets me keep in touch with the wider industry.

    means lots of text-based communication and no chance encounters with colleagues.
    This is very different from my beginnings as a full-stack developer in an agile
    team! Still, I enjoy it thoroughly and would dread going back to an office job
    in the short term (full-stack or not).

    on my own initiative. I try to write in such a way that co-workers feel I care
    about the work and about them; I try to get to know the people who work with me
    through one-on-one videocalls; I regularly connect with this blog’s readers and
    other people on the internet.

    than the more “forced” style you end up having in an office^(. It has also allowed
    me to be in touch with *very* talented people in the field. I’m looking forward
    to more!)

    went viral. My thesis was that, even if you are a generalist, it sometimes makes
    sense to present yourself as a specialist (for marketing reasons). In the same
    article I referred to myself as an undercover generalist, but after writing this
    blog post, I’m not that sure anymore! Nowadays I really want to focus on systems
    programming… which makes me feel like a specialist. Interestingly, [someone wrote](https://gusvanhorn.blogspot.com/2024/02/marketing-isnt-only-reason-to-specialize.html)
    in response to “the undercover generalist” saying that *“Specialization isn’t
    just a way to market. It’s part of becoming a generalist, which has to start with
    one or more specific areas of expertise.”* Does that make me a generalist *and*
    a specialist? I guess time will tell.
