    97% of countries and territories will have fertility rates below what is necessary
    to sustain population size over time, comparatively high fertility rates in numerous
    low-income countries, predominantly in Western and Eastern sub-Saharan Africa,
    will continue to drive population increases in these locations throughout the
    century. This “demographically divided world” will have enormous consequences
    for economies and societies, according to a new study [published in *The Lancet*.](http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(24)00550-6/fulltext)

    for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) at the University of Washington’s School
    of Medicine—for past, current, and future global, regional, and national trends
    in fertility and livebirths. In general, countries need to have a total fertility
    rate (TFR) of 2.1 children per person who could give birth, to sustain long-term
    generational replacement of the population. The TFR of a population is the average
    number of children that are born to a female over a lifetime, assuming childbearing
    at current fertility rates throughout the reproductive years.

    (e.g., level of education, unmet need for modern contraception, child mortality,
    and living in urban areas), and livebirths, the researchers estimate that by 2050,
    155 of 204 (76%) countries and territories will be below the replacement level
    of fertility. The number of countries and territories below replacement level
    is predicted to further increase to 198 of 204 (97%) by 2100\. This means that
    in these locations, populations will shrink unless low fertility can be offset
    by ethical and effective immigration. The extent of low fertility may also be
    mitigated in part by policies that offer greater support for parents.

    children for each female in 1950 to 2.2 children in 2021—with over half of all
    countries and territories (110 of 204) below the population replacement level
    of 2.1 births per female as of 2021\. This trend is particularly worrying for
    places such as South Korea and Serbia where the rate is less than 1.1 child for
    each female. But for many countries in sub-Saharan Africa, fertility rates remain
    high—the TFR of the region is nearly twice the global average, at four children
    per female in 2021\. In Chad, the TFR of seven births is the highest in the world.

    Niger, Chad, and Tajikistan) are expected to have fertility rates exceeding 2.1

    change, improve health care infrastructure, and continue to reduce child mortality
    rates, alongside actions to eliminate extreme poverty and ensure that women’s
    reproductive rights, family planning, and education for girls are top priorities

    contraceptives and female education—the two key drivers of fertility—could help
    accelerate declines in fertility and reduce birth rates in higher-fertility nations.
    For example, in sub-Saharan Africa, projections estimate that achieving the UN
    Sustainable Development Goals for universal female education or universal unmet
    need for modern contraceptives by 2030 would each result in fertility rates of
    2.3 births per woman in 2050 compared with around 2.7 births if these targets
    aren’t met.

    for example, the total fertility rate is predicted to be five children for each
    female in 2050\. But if the target of universal education were met by 2030, the
    rate is projected to decline to 2.7 children per female in 2050, while meeting
    universal contraceptive needs could lower the rate to 4.3 children.

    to provide financial support and care for children and families could have on
    increasing fertility rates in countries with below-replacement fertility. Based
    on existing information from countries that have already implemented such policies,
    the findings suggest that while pro-natal policies will not boost fertility rates
    up to replacement level, they may prevent some countries from dropping to extremely
    low fertility levels (with just 30 countries and territories below a TFR of 1.3
    in 2100 if pro-natal policies are implemented compared to 94 under the most likely
    scenario). It will be important for low-fertility countries to implement a combination
    of policies that support those who wish to have children and offer additional
    benefits to society such as better quality of life and greater participation of
    women in the workforce, alongside open immigration policies.

    birth rates such as enhanced parental leave, free childcare, financial incentives,
    and extra employment rights, may provide a small boost to fertility rates, but
    most countries will remain below replacement levels. And once nearly every country’s
    population is shrinking, reliance on open immigration will become necessary to
    sustain economic growth. Sub-Saharan African countries have a vital resource that
    aging societies are losing—a youthful population.”

    and no clear solutions, some countries might justify more Draconian measures that
    limit reproductive rights. It is well established that nations with strong women’s
    rights are more likely to have better health outcomes and faster economic growth.
    It is imperative women’s rights are promoted and protected and that women are
    supported in having the number of children they wish and pursuing their careers.”
