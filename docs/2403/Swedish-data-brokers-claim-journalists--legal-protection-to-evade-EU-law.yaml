- en: '**A highly problematic loophole in Swedish law.** In Sweden, anyone can get
    a media license and get exempt from the GDPR. While Article 85 of the GDPR allows
    member states to limit the application of some elements of the GDPR in the area
    of journalism (to e.g. protect sources or undercover investigations), Sweden took
    a brute force approach to this exception. Swedish national legislation makes it
    extremely easy to obtain a “media licence”, even if a company''s activities are
    not even remotely related to those of a news outlet and clearly just focused on
    sharing and selling personal data. Even data brokers, meaning privately operated
    companies that buy and sell the personal data of millions of people without their
    knowledge, can use this loophole to exempt themselves from any obligations under
    the GDPR. This deprives the people of their fundamental right to privacy and exposes
    their most intimate data to the internet.'

- en: '**Your most personal data, available to everyone.** One of Sweden’s largest
    data brokers, MrKoll (“koll” is Swedish for “checking” on other people), illustrates
    this issue very well. The company has data on almost the entire Swedish population
    and makes a profit by selling it to anyone who’s interested without a single safeguard
    or restriction. The data sold includes not only people’s names, surnames, dates
    of birth, telephone numbers, home and work addresses. The company also has data
    on real estate values, the car they drive, pending civil proceedings, penalties,
    criminal records and detailed case records. Almost all of the information is provided
    directly by the Swedish authorities. There is even a list of the most searched
    for people on the data broker’s website.'

    data brokers such as MrKoll has nothing to do with journalism. On the contrary,
    the company puts people at risk by offering their personal data for sale online
    to anyone who is interested. The Swedish authorities must finally put an end to
    this abuse of a law originally intended to protect journalists.”*'

- en: '**Personal data used by gangs and criminals.** One example of what the public
    sale of data by companies like MrKoll can lead to is illustrated by [a “Guardian”
    report](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/feb/11/sweden-freedom-of-information-laws-deadly-bombings)
    about rival gangs using data brokers to learn the geographical location of their
    opponents to carry out attacks. According to the article, these bombings and attacks
    did not spare innocent lives. Just last year, the 24-year old Soha Saad, an aspiring
    teacher, was mistakenly killed by an explosive. This is just one of many examples.
    Information about people’s addresses, their income, the value of their homes or
    possible room mates enables stalking and makes life much easier for robbers. This
    is made worse by the fact that, contrary to Article 17 GDPR, which usually gives
    everyone a right to object to the use of their personal data, there is currently
    no way to have your data deleted from MrKoll’s website. The complainant’s request
    to have his data deleted was rejected on the grounds that "the database is not
    affected by the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)" because of MrKoll’s
    media license'

    Saad因爆炸误杀。这只是众多例子之一。有关人们地址、收入、房屋价值或可能的室友的信息促使了跟踪并大大方便了强盗。情况更加糟糕的是，与通常赋予每个人拒绝使用其个人数据权利的《GDPR》第17条相反，目前无法从MrKoll的网站上删除您的数据。申诉人要求删除其数据的请求被拒绝，理由是“数据库不受《GDPR》的影响”，因为MrKoll拥有媒体许可证。'

    request to delete his data, thereby violating his rights under Article 17 GDPR.
    *noyb* requests that MrKoll delete the complainant’s data and notify all recipients
    of the deletion. *noyb* also requests that the DPA orders an absolute prohibition
    of any further processing of the complainant’s data. If the Swedish authority
    should reject this complaint on the basis of the above-mentioned national law,
    *noyb* is fully prepared to take the next step and appeal to the Stockholm Court
    in order to stop the misuse of media licenses by data brokers in general.'
