- en: '*"Just a quick question on the PPP data. Most years have a average PPP of 20c+
    per part. This sounds very high, especially when most sets come way under that
    (which are then marked as good value). Do Duplo sets get included in the years
    average PPP figure? Because they tend to be alot higher than LEGO sets. This is
    the only thing I could think of why the year average is almost double what I''d
    expect it to be."*'

    I built the PPP comparison when Brick Insights first launched in 2018, almost
    as an afterthought. I wanted to see if a set was worth buying from a MOCing point
    of view, and threw it in to help guide me. It was definitely time to take another
    look at those calculations.
