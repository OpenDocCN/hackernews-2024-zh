**Explanation:** How does the sky turn dark at night? In stages, and with different characteristic colors rising from the horizon. The [featured image](https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=10231968620107561) shows, left to right, increasingly late [twilight](ap230506.html) times after sunset in 20 different vertical bands. The picture was taken last month in [Syracuse](https://youtu.be/zopIdrtkbVE), [Sicily](https://youtu.be/NnKs9NDzvVs), [Italy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy), in the direction [opposite the Sun](ap190624.html). On the far left is the pre-sunset upper sky. Toward the right, prominent bands include the [Belt of Venus](ap230626.html), the [Blue Band](https://twanight.org/gallery/the-elusive-bands-of-anti-twilight/), the [Horizon Band](https://epod.usra.edu/blog/2023/01/anti-tiwilight-colors-and-belt-of-venus.html), and the Red Band. As the dark shadow of the Earth rises, the colors in these bands are [caused](https://www.eso.org/sci/publications/messenger/archive/no.178-dec19/messenger-no178-51-56.pdf) [by](https://opg.optica.org/ao/fulltext.cfm?uri=ao-56-19-G156&id=367436) direct sunlight reflecting from air and [aerosol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerosol)s in the [Earth's atmosphere](https://climate.nasa.gov/news/2919/earths-atmosphere-a-multi-layered-cake/), multiple reflections sometimes involving a [reddened sunset](ap170120.html), and [refraction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refraction). In practice, these bands can be diffuse and hard to discern, and their colors can depend on [colors near the setting Sun](ap061221.html). Finally, the Sun [completely sets](https://www.weather.gov/lmk/twilight-types) and the sky becomes dark. [Don't despair](https://qph.cf2.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-ad89b5e5f33336dc569bfe095c1342df-lq) -- the whole thing will happen in reverse when the [Sun rises](ap231019.html) again in the morning.
