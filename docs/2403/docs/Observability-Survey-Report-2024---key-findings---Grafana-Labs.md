> 来源：[https://grafana.com/observability-survey/](https://grafana.com/observability-survey/)

On behalf of Grafana Labs, we want to thank those who participated in the survey as well as those who took the time to view the results. The open source community, our customers, our contributors, and our users are all integral to everything we do here, and your input shapes how we operate and improve our projects and products on a daily basis.

We’re excited to see how far observability has come and how organizations are putting these tools and techniques into practice around the globe and across different industries and organizations of all sizes.
