Conservation charities like the Woodland Trust say that old trees are an important part of our history and are often the home to all kinds of different species of plant and animal life.

Adam Cormack, head of campaigning at the Woodland Trust said: "It's remarkable that this research suggests we are yet to find most of the UK's ancient trees, the cathedrals of the natural world."

But he believes that they should be given the same protections as historical buildings or endangered wildlife in the UK.

"These astonishing trees are our inheritance from history, and we should be treating them like national treasures," he urged.
