**Lady**
"Hi, I'm calling you because you have shown interest in the financial market."

**Me**
"I think you might have the wrong person on the line."

**Lady**
"Oh, what is your email address?"

**Me**
"I'm not giving you my email address."

**Lady**
"It's all right, I have it here, I just wanted to check. What is your full name?"

"No, I'm not… Wait… Why? I'm not interested in the financial market."

**Lady**
"You were in the past…"

**Me**
"Ok, bye."
