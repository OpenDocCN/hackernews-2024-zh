A team of researchers from The University of New Mexico's Museum of Southwestern Biology (MSB) have reported unexpectedly high levels of chemical contamination in wild birds and mammals at Holloman Air Force Base, near Alamogordo, N.M. in [new research](https://authors.elsevier.com/a/1icAg3Ao67R8u) published in *Environmental Research*.

The research found that animals were heavily contaminated with several [harmful compounds](https://phys.org/tags/harmful+compounds/) known as "forever chemicals," or per and poly-fluoroalkyl substances (PFAS). Even low concentrations of PFAS are known to cause cancer and developmental, reproductive, immune system, and endocrine problems in animals and people.

Although PFAS have been found in various wildlife worldwide, the new findings are unprecedented for exceptionally high concentrations across numerous species. Across 23 species of birds and mammals, PFAS concentrations averaged in the tens of thousands of parts per billion. To put this in perspective, the research team pointed out that thousands of dairy cattle in Clovis, N.M., recently had to be destroyed because their milk was contaminated at less than six parts per billion.

The study focused on the area around Holloman Lake, situated between Holloman Air Force Base and White Sands National Park, in the middle of the vast, dry Tularosa basin. The lake is part of a system of waste-water catchment ponds that the Air Force created.

"Because these large wetlands are the only ones in the region, they are immensely attractive to wildlife," said MSB Director and Professor of Biology Christopher Witt, and the lead author of the study.

"Holloman is one of the three most important wetlands in New Mexico for migratory waterbirds —over 100 species and tens of thousands of individuals use these habitats annually," Witt explained. "The wetlands are also heavily used by people for recreation and hunting."

The leading cause of contamination is thought to be the fire-fighting foam that was deployed over decades by the U.S. Air Force. The foam contained a mix of toxic PFAS that have since been phased out of manufacturing. Starting around 1970, the foam was widely used for training exercises at military installations. At Holloman A.F.B., runoff flowed into the waste-water catchments.

"PFAS compounds are highly stable, so they just accumulated there in the water and mud," said Research Associate in the MSB Division of Mammals and Research Professor in the Department of Biology Jean-Luc Cartron, a co-author on the study. "These substances also bind to proteins, so they were easily taken up by living creatures and then passed up the [food chain](https://phys.org/tags/food+chain/)."

To understand PFAS movement through the food web at Holloman Lake, the research team conducted over 2000 measurements, testing for the various compounds in different species and tissue types. The team focused on aquatic birds because of their heavy exposure to contaminated water and because they are sought after by hunters.

A set of desert rodents from the surrounding area was also tested because they would not be directly exposed to the water; thus, their potential contamination would reveal other avenues of PFAS movement.

Remarkably, the team found that both aquatic and terrestrial species tended to be heavily contaminated.
