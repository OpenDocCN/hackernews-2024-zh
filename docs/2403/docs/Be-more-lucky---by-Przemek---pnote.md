# Be more lucky - by Przemek - pnote

What if luck was a skill?

The proposition sounds absurd, and yet we all know people who seem to be good at being lucky. They don’t try that hard and nice things just keep coming: they meet the right people at the right time, narrowly catch all trains and never get pooped on by birds.

If we’re are not superstitious, then what could explain the patterns of good (or ill fortune) some of us experience?

Richard Wieseman (University of Hertfordshire) [describes](http://richardwiseman.com/resources/The_Luck_Factor.pdf) an experiment in which people first self-identify as lucky or unlucky; and then start working on a simple task: counting the photographs in a newspaper.

The pictures are easy enough to count: there are 43 of them.

But the newspaper also contains something else: within one of the columns, there’s a piece of text that reads: *Stop counting, tell the experimenter you have seen this and win $250.*

Guess which group tends to find the hidden message more often?

Why did the “unlucky” people miss the hidden message? According to Wieseman, people miss chance opportunities when they’re *too focused on looking for something else*.

> *They go to parties intent on finding their perfect partner and so miss opportunities to make good friends. They look through newspapers determined to find certain type of job advertisements and as a result miss other types of jobs.*

Meanwhile, lucky people tend to be more relaxed and have a softer focus, which helps them to notice the little opportunities gleaning on the periphery of their vision. (Literally or figuratively.)

**Tim Minchin**: Advice! Metaphor! Look at me go

Reading about this I had a strange sense of dejà vu, and then remembered [this bit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoEezZD71sc&t=211s) from the magnificent Tim Minchin:

> *The next worthy pursuit will probably appear in your **periphery**. Which is why you should be careful of long-term dreams: if you focus too far in front of you, you won’t see the shiny thing out the corner of your eye.*

Here’s a comedian and a psychology professor saying the same thing about good fortune 💫.

I’d love to see more ideas (and projects and products) that aim to increase the surface area of serendipity in our lives. There may be a startup idea along the lines of “Headspace but for luck”. How would such an app look like?

The spring has come to Paris and the sun is shining over the parc of Buttes Chaumont. Springtime is a great season to think of new projects and get enthusiastic about life :).

Good luck 🍀,
