# Digital Superpowers: a whirlwind tour of your computer

## Keep learning

You'll also get caught up on the latest security practices and tools, starting out with an orientation on the basics of home networking, password management, VPNs, and ad-blocking.

This book is written for everyday information workers, future computer whizzes looking for discovery, medical researchers with large datasets, graduate students with articles to publish, engineers sick of Excel, hobbyists, and retirees looking to keep up-to-date. It is not particularly intended for IT professionals, though they’d hopefully learn something too.

This book was first published on Amazon in early 2019\. After a few years, with sales dwindling, I updated it and released it for free on this website.
