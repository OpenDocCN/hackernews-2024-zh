correction

Due to incorrect information provided by Getty Images, an earlier version of this column incorrectly used a photo depicting a French nuclear test at Fangataufa Atoll in 1970 rather than the U.S. test at Bikini Atoll in 1954\. The column has been updated to remove the incorrect image.

*Walter Pincus, a former Post reporter and columnist and author of “Blown to Hell: America’s Deadly Betrayal of the Marshall Islanders,” writes for the Cipher Brief.*

March 1 was [Remembrance Day](https://www.state.gov/honoring-the-contributions-of-the-citizens-of-the-republic-of-the-marshall-islands/), a national holiday in the Marshall Islands.

On the morning of that date in 1954, the United States carried out [Castle Bravo](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/castle-bravo-the-largest-u-s-nuclear-explosion/), the first-ever trial of a deliverable hydrogen bomb, on [a man-made island](http://large.stanford.edu/courses/2015/ph241/singh-a2/) in Bikini Atoll in the mid-Pacific Marshall Islands. It was [6:45 a.m](https://ehss.energy.gov/ohre/roadmap/achre/chap12_3.html). Sunrise.
