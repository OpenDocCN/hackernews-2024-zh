# Open Policy Agent

> 来源：[https://www.openpolicyagent.org/](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/)

OPA embraces policy-as-code, complete with tools that help people use and understand the policies they put in place. Integrated development environments, testing, profiling, coverage, automated performance tuning, and hot reloading aren’t just things you need for programming--you need them for policy too, and OPA delivers.
