A United Airlines Boeing 777 made [an emergency landing after suffering a mid-air](https://www.irishstar.com/news/us-news/boeing-777-makes-emergency-landing-32342032) hydraulic [](https://www.irishstar.com/news/us-news/boeing-777-makes-emergency-landing-32342032) leak in the fifth safety incident involving Boeing aircraft in a week.

The plane landed safely back at Sydney Airport with no injuries, officials said.

In a separate incident hours before, a Boeing 787 Dreamliner from Sydney to Auckland suffered a 'technical event' that jolted passengers in their seats, reportedly sending one passenger flying headfirst into the cabin ceiling and injuring 50\. Both incidents are now under investigation.

With Boeing facing multiple government investigations, the company needs to make "a serious transformation" around its safety and manufacturing quality, Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said Monday.

The comments came one day after Buttigieg said the aircraft builder is under "enormous" scrutiny by his department since a panel blew off a Boeing 737 Max jetliner in midflight. Over the weekend, The Wall Street Journal said that the Department of Justice is looking into a problem with an Alaska Airlines plane on Jan, reports [the Mirror](https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/us-news/united-boeing-777-makes-emergency-32340308).

This comes after the airline said it couldn't find some records the National Transportation Safety Board wanted. These records were about work done on the plane at a Boeing factory.

The Federal Aviation Administration, which is part of Buttigieg's department, is also investigating Boeing. "Obviously we respect the independence of DOJ (the Department of Justice) and NTSB (the National Transportation Safety Board) doing their own work," Buttigieg told reporters. He added: "but we are not neutral on the question of whether Boeing should fully cooperate with any entity - NTSB, us, or DOJ. They should, and we expect them to."

Buttigieg also mentioned that Boeing needs to alter their responsiveness, their company culture, and how they handle quality. Boeing only gave a short reply.

"We will continue to cooperate fully and transparently with all government investigations and audits, as we take comprehensive action to improve safety and quality at Boeing," the company said. Alaska Airlines also stated that they are working with the Justice Department investigation.

"In an event like this, it's normal for the DOJ to be conducting an investigation," the Seattle-based airline said in a statement. "We are fully cooperating and do not believe we are a target of the investigation."

The New York Times reported on Tuesday that Boeing failed 33 out of 89 FAA audits during an examination after the incident on the Alaska Airlines jet. The extensive six-week audit found many problems in different parts of the 737 Max, according to the report, which cited a slide presentation on the audits of aspects of the production process.

The report mentioned that seven out of 13 audits focusing on Spirit AeroSystems, which makes the body of the aircraft, also failed. One example given was the use of liquid Dawn dish soap to lubricate a door seal during a "fit-up" process.

The audits dealing with the door plug, the part that blew off the Alaska Airlines jet, found issues at both Boeing and Spirit AeroSystems. In an emailed comment on the report, Boeing said on Tuesday that it was continuing to implement changes and to "develop a comprehensive action plan to strengthen safety and quality, and build the confidence of our customers and their passengers."

"We are squarely focused on taking significant, demonstrated action with transparency at every turn," Boeing declared last week. Despite facing severe criticism from NTSB Chair Jennifer Homendy over missing work records on an Alaska aircraft, the company, based in Arlington, Virginia, is defending itself.

She informed a Senate committee that Boeing had continually declined her agency's requests for information following the issue. Although Boeing disputed some of Homendy's claims, the NTSB supported her statements.

Additionally, the FAA has prohibited Boeing from increasing Max jets' production and provided the company with 90 days to devise a strategy addressing quality-control concerns.

United Airlines released a statement which read: "On Monday, March 11, United flight 830 from Sydney Kingsford Smith Airport to [San Francisco](https://www.irishstar.com/all-about/san-francisco) International Airport returned to Sydney due to a maintenance issue. The plane landed safely and passengers deplaned normally at the gate. We are providing accommodation overnight for passengers and rebooking them to San Francisco tomorrow."
