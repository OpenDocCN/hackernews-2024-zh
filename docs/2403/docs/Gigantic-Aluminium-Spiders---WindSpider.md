WindSpider is now preparing to start building the first full scale unit of its crane system in aluminium. It is tailored for installation and major component replacement of onshore and offshore wind turbines. The solution eliminates the relative motion between the crane and the wind turbine by using the turbine tower as support.

With an effective lifting capacity of more than 1500 tons, WindSpider solves some of the biggest issues in the wind industry and is prepared for the next generations of wind turbines, at a substantially lower cost. The solution allows for game changing offshore installation and maintenance of floating wind turbines on site instead of tow-to-shore for repairs.

The team behind the innovative technology has an extensive industrial experience and the solution is developed in close cooperation with several of the internationally leading wind operators. The company recently secured new equity from existing owners, such as the industrial group IKM, in addition to attracting new investors.

**New industrial investor**

WindSpider has entered into an industrial cooperation with Leirvik Group AS (Leirvik), marking the beginning of the first phase of building the first WindSpider unit. Leirvik will also invest in WindSpider and become a new industrial partner.

Leirvik and WindSpider have concluded a study evaluating the use of aluminium in the WindSpider structure and will proceed with engineering and design, according to the agreement between the two companies. Aluminium offers significant advantages, including substantial weight reduction, as well as improved production methods and maintenance. The cooperation will also consider tailor made aluminium profiles to be used in the WindSpider structure.

“*WindSpider is very pleased to have partnered with a strong company like Leirvik. We see great strengths and synergies in combining the entrepreneurial spirit of WindSpider with Leirvik’s industrial experience as we begin our process of building the first WindSpider unit, which will follow the currently ongoing development of the control system and the simulator*”, comments Hans Olav Hide, Chairman of the Board at WindSpider.

Through the cooperation, WindSpider will gain access to Leirvik’ resources, including engineering, support functions and systems, which will be very beneficial in the process of preparation, fabrication and testing of the first WindSpider unit.

“*Leirvik is impressed by WindSpider’s system and believe it will be a gamechanger in the growing global wind market. Combined with Leirvik’s extensive experience and unique knowledge related to large constructions in aluminium, we see great synergies with WindSpider going forward and also significant benefits of building the WindSpider system in aluminium” says Helge Gjøsæter, CEO in Leirvik.*
