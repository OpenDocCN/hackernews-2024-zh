# Work at Deepnote

We started Deepnote to help data teams solve the hardest problems. We don’t just need better algorithms, bigger data sets, and more computing power. We need tools that help us explore, collaborate, and share. These tools don’t exist yet. **We need to invent them first.**

Data work is as much a scientific and creative process as it is an engineering one. It involves working together, failing, learning, and going back to the drawing board. [Data professionals are explorers](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8103446). To make projects successful, we need tools that are both powerful and easy to use. Tools that help us collaborate and share our work in an engaging way. Tools that make working with data fun again.

That’s why we’re building the new standard in data tooling: a notebook that brings teams together to code, query, visualize, organize, and share — all in one place.

**We are building tools for explorers. Join us.**
