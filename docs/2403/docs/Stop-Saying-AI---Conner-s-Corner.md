# Stop Saying AI | Conner's Corner

In a conversation with a colleague today I realized I have decided to no longer refer to LLMs as AI. I guess this is my tiny rebellion against the ongoing hype.

I think LLMs are amazing and have made work that I used to really dislike a lot less frustrating. You can probably tell I use DALL-E to generate some of the hero images on this site. I use one to help me proofread and edit things quite often. They are going to have negative impacts on the number of jobs in some industries. But they are not intelligence and anyone who spends time with them quickly realizes they are just a very superpowered suggestion engine. AI gives the idea of them way more power than they deserve, so let’s stop calling them that.
