# 4D Golf is making my brain melt away | GamingOnLinux

Released on March 22nd, 4D Golf is about exploring higher dimensions through Golf. It's absolutely wild visually and I think you need to see this. It's making my brain go "what the fuck?".

The developer describes it as "a mind-bending golf game unlike any other because it's set entirely in a 4-dimensional space. Complete fun and unique golfing challenges as you gain hands-on experience of the 4th dimension and beyond!" but uh, no amount of screenshots or descriptions will do the weirdness justice, just check out the trailer below:

And for a little more the developer did a quick talk on the journey:

Game Features:

> *   Over 120 levels and 7 vibrant themed worlds.
> *   Tons of visualization options to master 4D space.
> *   Build your own 4D courses in the level editor.
> *   Race the clock in Marble Platforming Mode.
> *   Navigate hidden paths, moving platforms, shifting gravity, speed boosts, and more!
> *   Unlock custom accessories by completing challenges.

Reminds me of how brain destroying [5D Chess With Multiverse Time Travel](https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2020/08/you-could-play-chess-but-why-not-play-5d-chess-with-multiverse-time-travel/) was but even more chaotic.

[Available on Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2147950/4D_Golf/) with Native Linux support.
