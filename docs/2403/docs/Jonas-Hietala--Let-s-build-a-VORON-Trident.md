# Jonas Hietala: Let's build a VORON Trident

> 来源：[https://www.jonashietala.se/series/voron_trident/](https://www.jonashietala.se/series/voron_trident/)

This series documents my journey building my very first 3D printer: a [VORON Trident 250](https://vorondesign.com/voron_trident "VORON Trident 3D printer").

I’m not a 3D printer expert—in fact I’m a complete beginner and I’ve never even held a 3D printed part in my hand before—so don’t expect any deep insights from this series. Instead I’ll try to document my progress, write about problems I encounter, contain lots of pictures, and will hopefully end with an awesome printer.
