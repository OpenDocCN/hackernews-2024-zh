Today, Justice Mellor found that the evidence in the COPA v Wright trial was “overwhelming,” ruling that:

1.  Dr Wright is **not** the author of the Bitcoin White Paper.
2.  Dr Wright is **not** the person who adopted or operated under the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto from 2008 - 2011.
3.  Dr Wright is **not** the person who created the Bitcoin System.
4.  Dr Wright is **not** the author of the initial versions of the Bitcoin software.

Justice Mellor commented: “Any further relief will be dealt with in my written judgement. I will extend time for filing any appellant’s notice until 21 days after the form of order hearing, which will be appointed following the hand down of my written judgement.”

A COPA spokesperson said, “This decision is a win for developers, for the entire open source community, and for the truth. For over eight years, Dr. Wright and his financial backers have lied about his identity as Satoshi Nakamoto and used that lie to bully and intimidate developers in the bitcoin community. That ends today with the court’s ruling that Craig Wright is not Satoshi Nakamoto.”
