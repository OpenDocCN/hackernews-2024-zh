Chinese state-owned crane manufacturer **Shanghai Zhenhua Heavy Industries Co. Ltd.** has reassured its customers that its cranes pose no cybersecurity threat to any port. The move follows a United States congressional investigation that alleged some Chinese-made cranes at U.S. ports feature ambiguous communications equipment.

The probe, conducted by the Committee on Homeland Security and the Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party, scrutinized more than 200 Chinese-made cranes at U.S. ports. It revealed that some contained undocumented cellular modems, as reported by CNN, citing a congressional aide familiar with the investigation.
