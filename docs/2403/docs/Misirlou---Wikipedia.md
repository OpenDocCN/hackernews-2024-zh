Eastern Mediterranean folk song

"**Misirlou**" ([Greek](/wiki/Greek_language "Greek language"): Μισιρλού < [Turkish](/wiki/Turkish_language "Turkish language"): *Mısırlı* 'Egyptian' < [Arabic](/wiki/Arabic_language "Arabic language"): مصر *Miṣr* '[Egypt](/wiki/Egypt "Egypt")'^([[1]](#cite_note-1))) is a folk song^([[2]](#cite_note-2)) from the [Eastern Mediterranean](/wiki/Eastern_Mediterranean "Eastern Mediterranean") region. The original author of the song is not known, but [Arabic](/wiki/Arabic_music "Arabic music"), [Greek](/wiki/Music_of_Greece "Music of Greece"), and [Jewish](/wiki/Jewish_music "Jewish music") musicians were playing it by the 1920s. The earliest known recording of the song is a 1927 Greek [rebetiko](/wiki/Rebetiko "Rebetiko")/[tsifteteli](/wiki/Tsifteteli "Tsifteteli") composition. There are also Arabic [belly dancing](/wiki/Belly_dance "Belly dance"), [Albanian](/wiki/Music_of_Albania "Music of Albania"), [Armenian](/wiki/Music_of_Armenia "Music of Armenia"), [Serbian](/wiki/Music_of_Serbia "Music of Serbia"), [Persian](/wiki/Music_of_Iran "Music of Iran"), [Indian](/wiki/Indian_music "Indian music") and [Turkish](/wiki/Music_of_Turkey "Music of Turkey") versions of the song. This song was popular from the 1920s onwards in the [Arab American](/wiki/Arab_American "Arab American"), [Armenian American](/wiki/Armenian_American "Armenian American") and [Greek American](/wiki/Greek_American "Greek American") communities who settled in the United States.

The song was a hit in 1946 for [Jan August](/wiki/Jan_August "Jan August"), an American pianist and xylophonist nicknamed "the one-man piano duet". It gained worldwide popularity through [Dick Dale](/wiki/Dick_Dale "Dick Dale")'s 1962 [American](/wiki/Music_of_the_United_States "Music of the United States") [surf rock](/wiki/Surf_music "Surf music") version, originally titled "**Miserlou**", which popularized the song in [Western](/wiki/Western_world "Western world") [popular culture](/wiki/Popular_culture "Popular culture"); Dale's version was influenced by an earlier Arabic folk version played with an [oud](/wiki/Oud "Oud"). Various versions have since been recorded, mostly based on Dale's version, including other surf and [rock](/wiki/Rock_music "Rock music") versions by bands such as [the Beach Boys](/wiki/The_Beach_Boys "The Beach Boys"), [the Ventures](/wiki/The_Ventures "The Ventures"), and [the Trashmen](/wiki/The_Trashmen "The Trashmen"), as well as international orchestral [easy listening](/wiki/Easy_listening "Easy listening") ([exotica](/wiki/Exotica "Exotica")) versions by musicians such as [Martin Denny](/wiki/Martin_Denny "Martin Denny") and [Arthur Lyman](/wiki/Arthur_Lyman "Arthur Lyman"). Dale's surf rock version was heard in the 1994 film *[Pulp Fiction](/wiki/Pulp_Fiction "Pulp Fiction")*.

## History[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Misirlou&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: History")]

Misirlou (Μισιρλού), due to the suffix "ou", is the feminine form (in Greek^([[3]](#cite_note-3))) of Misirlis (Μισιρλής- a surname) which comes from the Turkish word Mısırlı, which is formed by combining Mısır ("Egypt" in Turkish, borrowed from Arabic مِصر‎ Miṣr) with the [Turkish -lı suffix](/wiki/Turkish_vocabulary#Adjectives_from_nouns "Turkish vocabulary"), literally meaning "Egyptian". Therefore, the song is about an Egyptian woman. The original Turkish word *Mısırlı* is, however, [genderless](/wiki/Genderless_language "Genderless language").

### Composition[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Misirlou&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Composition")]

The folk song has origins in the [Eastern Mediterranean](/wiki/Eastern_Mediterranean "Eastern Mediterranean") region of the [Ottoman Empire](/wiki/Ottoman_Empire "Ottoman Empire"), but the original author of the song is not known. There is evidence that the folk song was known to [Arabic musicians](/wiki/Arabic_music "Arabic music"), Greek [rebetiko](/wiki/Rebetiko "Rebetiko") musicians and Jewish [klezmer](/wiki/Klezmer "Klezmer") musicians by the 1920s.^([[4]](#cite_note-4)) The claim in some sources that the tune derives from the song "Bint Misr" ("Egyptian Girl") written by Egyptian musician [Sayed Darwish](/wiki/Sayed_Darwish "Sayed Darwish") is thought to be incorrect.^([[5]](#cite_note-5))

The earliest known recording of the song was by the [rebetiko](/wiki/Rebetiko "Rebetiko") musician Theodotos ("Tetos") Demetriades ([Greek](/wiki/Greek_language "Greek language"): Θεόδοτος ("Τέτος") Δημητριάδης) in 1927\. Demetriades, an [Ottoman Greek](/wiki/Ottoman_Greeks "Ottoman Greeks"), was born in [Istanbul](/wiki/Istanbul "Istanbul"), [Ottoman Empire](/wiki/Ottoman_Empire "Ottoman Empire"), in 1897, and he resided there until he moved to the [United States](/wiki/United_States "United States") in 1921,^([[6]](#cite_note-tetos-6)) during a period when most of the Greek speaking population [fled](/wiki/Greek_genocide "Greek genocide") the emerging Turkish state. It is likely that he was familiar with the song as a folk song before he moved to the United States. As with almost all early rebetika songs (a style that originated with the Greek refugees from Asia Minor in [Turkey](/wiki/Turkey "Turkey")), the song's actual [composer](/wiki/Composer "Composer") has never been identified, and its ownership rested with the band leader. Demetriades named the song "Misirlou" in his original 1927 [Columbia](/wiki/Columbia_Records "Columbia Records") recording, which is a Greek assimilated borrowing of the regional pronunciation of "Egyptian" in Turkish ("Mısırlı"), as opposed to the corresponding word for "Egyptian" (female) in Greek, which is Αιγύπτια (*Aigyptia*).

The rebetiko version of the song was intended for a Greek [tsifteteli](/wiki/Tsifteteli "Tsifteteli") dance, at a slower [tempo](/wiki/Tempo "Tempo") and a different [key](/wiki/Key_(music) "Key (music)") than the Oriental performances that most are familiar with today. This was the style of recording by Michalis Patrinos in Greece, circa 1930, which was circulated in the [United States](/wiki/United_States "United States") by the [Orthophonic](/wiki/Orthophonic "Orthophonic") label; another recording was made by Patrinos in [New York City](/wiki/New_York_City "New York City") in 1931 as well.

The song's Oriental melody has been so popular for so long that many people, from [Morocco](/wiki/Morocco "Morocco") to [Iraq](/wiki/Iraq "Iraq"), claim it to be a folk song from their own country. In the realm of [Middle Eastern music](/wiki/Middle_Eastern_music "Middle Eastern music"), the song is a very simple one, since it is little more than going up and down the *Hijaz Kar* or [double harmonic scale](/wiki/Double_harmonic_scale "Double harmonic scale") (E-F-G#-A-B-C-D#). It still remains a well known [Greek](/wiki/Greece "Greece"), [Klezmer](/wiki/Klezmer "Klezmer") and [Arab](/wiki/Arab "Arab") folk song.

### Later versions[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Misirlou&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Later versions")]

In 1941, Nick Roubanis, a [Greek-American](/wiki/Greek-American "Greek-American") music instructor, released a [jazz](/wiki/Jazz "Jazz") instrumental arrangement of the song, crediting himself as the composer. Since his claim was never legally challenged, he is still officially credited as the composer today worldwide, except in Greece where credit is given to either Roubanis or Patrinos. Subsequently, Chaim Tauber, [Fred Wise](/wiki/Fred_Wise_(songwriter) "Fred Wise (songwriter)") and Milton Leeds wrote [English](/wiki/English_language "English language") lyrics to the song.^([[7]](#cite_note-7)) Roubanis is also credited with fine-[tuning](/wiki/Musical_tuning "Musical tuning") the [key](/wiki/Key_(music) "Key (music)") and the [melody](/wiki/Melody "Melody"), giving it the Oriental sound that it is associated with today. The song soon became an "exotica" standard among the light swing (lounge) bands of the day.^([*[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")*])

[Harry James](/wiki/Harry_James "Harry James") recorded and released "'Misirlou" in 1941 on [Columbia](/wiki/Columbia_Records "Columbia Records") 36390, and the song peaked at No. 22 on the U.S. chart.^([[8]](#cite_note-Whitburn-8))

In 1946, pianist [Jan August](/wiki/Jan_August "Jan August") recorded a version of the song on [Diamond Records](/wiki/Diamond_Records "Diamond Records") (Diamond 2009), which reached No. 7 on the Billboard Jockey charts in the U.S.^([[9]](#cite_note-9))

In 1951, Turkish-Jewish polyglot singer [Darío Moreno](/wiki/Dar%C3%ADo_Moreno "Darío Moreno") recorded a version with lyrics sung in French.

In 1962, [Dick Dale](/wiki/Dick_Dale "Dick Dale") rearranged the song as a solo [instrumental rock](/wiki/Instrumental_rock "Instrumental rock") [guitar](/wiki/Guitar "Guitar") piece. During a performance, Dale was bet by a young fan that he could not play a song on only one string of his guitar. Dale's father and uncles were [Lebanese-American](/wiki/Lebanese_American "Lebanese American") musicians, and Dale remembered seeing his uncle play "Misirlou" on one string of the [oud](/wiki/Oud "Oud"). He vastly increased the song's tempo to make it into [rock and roll](/wiki/Rock_and_roll "Rock and roll"). It was Dale's [surf](/wiki/Surf_music "Surf music") version that introduced "Misirlou" to a wider audience in the U.S.^([[10]](#cite_note-10))

Jazz pianist [Vince Guaraldi](/wiki/Vince_Guaraldi "Vince Guaraldi") recorded a live version with his quartet at the Trident Jazz Club in [Sausalito, California](/wiki/Sausalito,_California "Sausalito, California") in December 1962\. It was released the following year on *[Vince Guaraldi in Person](/wiki/In_Person_(Vince_Guaraldi_album) "In Person (Vince Guaraldi album)")*, and received critical accolades from *Why It Matters* blogger James Stafford stating "for sheer plaster-a-smile-on-your-face delight, nothing beats his take on the Mediterranean traditional song".^([[11]](#cite_note-11))

[The Beach Boys](/wiki/The_Beach_Boys "The Beach Boys") recorded a Dale-inspired "Misirlou" for the 1963 album *[Surfin' U.S.A.](/wiki/Surfin%27_U.S.A._(album) "Surfin' U.S.A. (album)")*, solidifying "Misirlou" as a staple of American pop culture.^([[12]](#cite_note-12))

In 1972, [Serbian](/wiki/Serbia "Serbia") folk singer [Staniša Stošić](/wiki/Stani%C5%A1a_Sto%C5%A1i%C4%87 "Staniša Stošić") recorded his version of the song, called *"Lela Vranjanka"* (*"Lela from [Vranje](/wiki/Vranje "Vranje")"*).^([[13]](#cite_note-13))

In 1945, a [Pittsburgh](/wiki/Pittsburgh "Pittsburgh") women's musical organization asked Professor Brunhilde E. Dorsch to organize an international dance group at [Duquesne University](/wiki/Duquesne_University "Duquesne University") to honor America's World War II allies. She contacted Mercine Nesotas, who taught several Greek dances, including [Syrtos Haniotikos](/wiki/Syrtos#Syrtos_Chaniotikos "Syrtos") (from Crete), which she called Kritikos, but for which they had no music. Because Pittsburgh's Greek-American community did not know Cretan music, Pat Mandros Kazalas, a music student, suggested the tune "Misirlou", although slower, might fit the dance.

The dance was first performed at a program to honor America's allies of World War II at [Stephen Foster Memorial](/wiki/Stephen_Foster_Memorial "Stephen Foster Memorial") Hall in Pittsburgh on March 6, 1945\. Thereafter, this new dance, which had been created by putting the Syrtos Kritikos to the slower "Misirlou" music, was known as Misirlou and spread among the Greek-American community, as well as among non-Greek U.S. folk-dance enthusiasts.

It has been a staple for decades of dances held at [Serbian Orthodox](/wiki/Serbian_Orthodox "Serbian Orthodox") churches across the U.S., performed as a [kolo](/wiki/Kolo_(dance) "Kolo (dance)"), a [circle dance](/wiki/Circle_dance "Circle dance"). The dance is also performed to instrumental versions of "[Never on Sunday](/wiki/Never_on_Sunday_(song) "Never on Sunday (song)")" by [Manos Hadjidakis](/wiki/Manos_Hadjidakis "Manos Hadjidakis") – though in the Serbian-American community, "Never on Sunday" was popularly enjoyed as a couple's dance and actually sung in English. "Never on Sunday" was often one of only two songs performed in English at these dances, the other song being "Spanish Eyes" (formerly "[Moon Over Naples](/wiki/Moon_Over_Naples "Moon Over Naples")") also internationally popular in its time.

The Misirlou dance also found its way into the Armenian-American community who, like the Greeks, were fond of [circle dances](/wiki/Circle_dance "Circle dance"), and occasionally adopted Greek dances. The first Armenian version of "Misirlou" was recorded by Reuben Sarkisian in [Fresno](/wiki/Fresno,_California "Fresno, California") the early 1950s. Sarkisian wrote the Armenian lyrics to "Misirlou" which are still sung today, however he wrote the song as "Akh, Anoushes" ("Ah, My Sweet") while later Armenian singers would change it to "Ah Anoush Yar" ("Ah, Sweet Lover"; Yar meaning sweetheart or lover, from Turkish).

In 1994, Dick Dale's version of "Misirlou" was used on the [soundtrack](/wiki/Pulp_Fiction_(soundtrack) "Pulp Fiction (soundtrack)") of the [motion picture](/wiki/Motion_picture "Motion picture") *[Pulp Fiction](/wiki/Pulp_Fiction "Pulp Fiction")*, prominently featured over the opening titles.^([[14]](#cite_note-14))

The song was selected by the [Athens 2004 Olympics](/wiki/Athens_2004_Olympics "Athens 2004 Olympics") Organizing Committee as one of the most influential Greek songs of all time, and was heard in venues and at the closing ceremony – performed by [Anna Vissi](/wiki/Anna_Vissi "Anna Vissi").^([[15]](#cite_note-15))

In March 2005, [*Q* magazine](/wiki/Q_magazine "Q magazine") placed Dale's version at number 89 in its list of the 100 Greatest Guitar Tracks.^([[16]](#cite_note-16))

The [Black Eyed Peas](/wiki/Black_Eyed_Peas "Black Eyed Peas") heavily incorporates Dale's version of "Misirlou" in their 2006 single "[Pump It](/wiki/Pump_It "Pump It")".
