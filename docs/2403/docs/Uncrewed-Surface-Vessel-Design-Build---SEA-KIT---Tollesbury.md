# Uncrewed Surface Vessel Design Build | SEA-KIT | Tollesbury

> 来源：[https://www.sea-kit.com](https://www.sea-kit.com)

SEA-KIT's remotely-controlled Uncrewed Surface Vessels (USVs) are designed with an adaptable payload area for multiple mission configurations. These vessels can work standalone or as part of a fleet to complete a wide range of tasks faster, cheaper and with less risk to personnel and significantly reduced carbon emissions than traditional, crewed vessels.
