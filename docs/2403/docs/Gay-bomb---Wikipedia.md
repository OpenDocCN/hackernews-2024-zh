Hypothetical psychochemical weapon

The "**gay bomb**" (informally known) refers to a non-lethal psychochemical weapon concept that was speculated upon by a research laboratory within the [United States Air Force](/wiki/United_States_Air_Force "United States Air Force"). This unconventional idea involved the dispersion of sex pheromones over enemy forces, with the intent of generating mutual sexual attraction among them causing mass confusion and panic within their platoons.

Dating back to 1994, the [Wright Laboratory](/wiki/Wright_Laboratory "Wright Laboratory") in Ohio, a precursor to the modern [United States Air Force Research Laboratory](/wiki/United_States_Air_Force_Research_Laboratory "United States Air Force Research Laboratory"), drafted a three-page proposal detailing several potential nonlethal chemical weapons. This document, eventually acquired by the [Sunshine Project](/wiki/Sunshine_Project "Sunshine Project") via a [Freedom of Information Act](/wiki/Freedom_of_Information_Act "Freedom of Information Act") request, explores the notion of the "gay bomb" among other concepts.

## Background[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Gay_bomb&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Background")]

No well-controlled scientific studies have ever been published suggesting the possibility of pheromones causing rapid behavioral changes in humans.^([[1]](#cite_note-wy-1))

Some body spray advertisers claim that their products contain human sexual [pheromones](/wiki/Pheromones "Pheromones") which act as an [aphrodisiac](/wiki/Aphrodisiac "Aphrodisiac"). In the 1970s, "copulins" were patented as products which release human pheromones, based on research on [rhesus monkeys](/wiki/Rhesus_monkey "Rhesus monkey").^([[1]](#cite_note-wy-1)) Subsequently, androstenone, axillary sweat, and "vomodors" have been claimed to act as human pheromones.^([[2]](#cite_note-Warren_S._T._Hays-2))

Despite these claims, no pheromonal substance has ever been demonstrated to directly influence human behavior in a [peer reviewed](/wiki/Peer_review "Peer review") study.^([[1]](#cite_note-wy-1))^([[2]](#cite_note-Warren_S._T._Hays-2))^([[3]](#cite_note-Neu-3))

Using a brain imaging technique, Swedish researchers have shown that when [homosexual](/wiki/Homosexuality "Homosexuality") and [heterosexual](/wiki/Heterosexuality "Heterosexuality") males are presented with two odors that may be involved in sexual arousal their brains tend to respond differently, and that the [homosexual men](/wiki/Homosexual_men "Homosexual men") tend to respond in the same way as heterosexual women, though it could not be determined whether this was cause or effect.^([[4]](#cite_note-Savic2005-4)) The study was expanded to include homosexual women; the results were consistent with previous findings meaning that homosexual women were not as responsive to male identified odors, while their response to female cues was similar to that of heterosexual males.^([[5]](#cite_note-pmid16705035-5)) According to the researchers, this research suggests a possible role for human pheromones in the biological basis of [sexual orientation](/wiki/Sexual_orientation "Sexual orientation").^([[6]](#cite_note-6))

## Leaked documents[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Gay_bomb&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Leaked documents")]

In both of the documents, the possibility was canvassed that a strong [aphrodisiac](/wiki/Aphrodisiac "Aphrodisiac") could be dropped on enemy troops, ideally one which would also cause "homosexual behavior". The documents described the aphrodisiac weapon as "distasteful but completely [non-lethal](/wiki/Non-lethal "Non-lethal")".^([[7]](#cite_note-houstonvoice.com-7))^([[8]](#cite_note-8))

## Body odors[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Gay_bomb&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Body odors")]

[Body odor](/wiki/Body_odor "Body odor") remote-engineering, involving compounds found in [halitosis](/wiki/Halitosis "Halitosis") and [hyperhidrosis](/wiki/Hyperhidrosis "Hyperhidrosis"), was another possibility discussed. Again, these effects would be produced by a non-lethal chemical weapon—possibly one that would affect the [hormonal](/wiki/Hormonal "Hormonal") and [digestive](/wiki/Digestion "Digestion") systems. It appears that a 'heavy [sweating](/wiki/Sweating "Sweating") bomb', '[flatulence](/wiki/Flatulence "Flatulence") bomb' and '[halitosis](/wiki/Halitosis "Halitosis") bomb' were also considered by a committee at the time. The plan was to make an enemy so smelly they could be quite literally sniffed out of hiding by their opponents^([*[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")*]).

## Ig Nobel Prize awards[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Gay_bomb&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Ig Nobel Prize awards")]

Wright Laboratory won the satiric 2007 [Ig Nobel Peace Prize](/wiki/Ig_Nobel_Prize "Ig Nobel Prize") for "instigating research & development on a chemical weapon—the so-called 'gay bomb'—that will make enemy soldiers become sexually irresistible to each other."^([[9]](#cite_note-9))
