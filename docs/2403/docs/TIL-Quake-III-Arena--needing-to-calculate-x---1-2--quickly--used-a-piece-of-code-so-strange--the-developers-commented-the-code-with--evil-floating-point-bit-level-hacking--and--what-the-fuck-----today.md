*   You learn something new every day; what did *you* learn today?

*   Submit interesting and **specific facts** that you just found out (not broad information you looked up, TodayILearned is not [/r/wikipedia](/r/wikipedia)).

# Posting rules

1.  **Submissions must be verifiable**. *Please link directly to a reliable source that supports every claim in your post title.* **Images alone do not count as valid references.** Videos are fine so long as they come from reputable sources (e.g. BBC, Discovery, etc).
2.  **No personal opinions, anecdotes or subjective statements** (e.g "TIL xyz is a great movie").

3.  **No recent sources.** Any sources (blog, article, press release, video, etc.) with a publication date more recent than two months are not allowed.

4.  No politics, soapboxing, or agenda based submissions. This includes (but is not limited to) submissions related to:

    1.  Recent political issues and politicians
    2.  Social and economic issues (including race/religion/gender)
    3.  Environmental issues
    4.  Police misconduct
5.  **No misleading claims**. Posts that omit essential information, or present unrelated facts in a way that suggest a connection will be removed.

6.  *Rephrase your post title if the following are not met:*

    1.  Titles **must** begin with "TIL ..."
    2.  Make them **descriptive, concise and specific** (e.g. not "TIL something interesting about bacon").
    3.  Titles must be able to **stand on their own** without requiring readers to click on a link. Starting your title with a why/what/who/where/how modifier should be unnecessary.
    4.  *"TIL about ..." and other broad posts don't belong on TIL. Try [/r/Wikipedia](/r/Wikipedia), etc. instead, or be more specific (and avoid the word "about").*
    5.  *"TIL how to ..." posts belong on* **[/r/HowTo](/r/HowTo).**
    6.  *"TIL the definition of a word..." Word definitions/translations/origins are not appropriate here*
7.  No submissions related to the usage, existence or features of specific software/websites (e.g. "TIL you can click on widgets in WidgetMaker 1.22").

8.  **All NSFW links must be tagged** *(including comments).*

    #### *Please see the [wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/wiki/index) for more detailed explanations of the rules, as well as additional rules that may not be listed here*
