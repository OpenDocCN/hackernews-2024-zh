# The "current branch" in git

> 来源：[https://jvns.ca/blog/2024/03/22/the-current-branch-in-git/](https://jvns.ca/blog/2024/03/22/the-current-branch-in-git/)

Hello! I know I just wrote [a blog post about HEAD in git](https://jvns.ca/blog/2024/03/08/how-head-works-in-git/), but I’ve been thinking more about what the term “current branch” means in git and it’s a little weirder than I thought.

### four possible definitions for “current branch”

1.  It’s what’s in the file **`.git/HEAD`**. This is how the [git glossary](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitglossary#def_HEAD) defines it.
2.  It’s what **`git status`** says on the first line
3.  It’s what you most recently **checked out** with `git checkout` or `git switch`
4.  It’s what’s in your shell’s **git prompt**. I use [fish_git_prompt](https://fishshell.com/docs/current/cmds/fish_git_prompt.html) so that’s what I’ll be talking about.

I originally thought that these 4 definitions were all more or less the same, but after chatting with some people on Mastodon, I realized that they’re more different from each other than I thought.

So let’s talk about a few git scenarios and how each of these definitions plays out in each of them. I used git version `2.39.2 (Apple Git-143)` for all of these experiments.

### scenario 1: right after `git checkout main`

Here’s the most normal situation: you check out a branch.

1.  `.git/HEAD` contains `ref: refs/heads/main`
2.  `git status` says `On branch main`
3.  The thing I most recently checked out was: `main`
4.  My shell’s git prompt says: `(main)`

In this case the 4 definitions all match up: they’re all `main`. Simple enough.

### scenario 2: right after `git checkout 775b2b399`

Now let’s imagine I check out a specific commit ID (so that we’re in “detached HEAD state”).

1.  `.git/HEAD` contains `775b2b399fb8b13ee3341e819f2aaa024a37fa92`
2.  `git status` says `HEAD detached at 775b2b39`
3.  The thing I most recently checked out was `775b2b399`
4.  My shell’s git prompt says `((775b2b39))`

Again, these all basically match up – some of them have truncated the commit ID and some haven’t, but that’s it. Let’s move on.

### scenario 3: right after `git checkout v1.0.13`

What if we’ve checked out a tag, instead of a branch or commit ID?

1.  `.git/HEAD` contains `ca182053c7710a286d72102f4576cf32e0dafcfb`
2.  `git status` says `HEAD detached at v1.0.13`
3.  The thing I most recently checked out was `v1.0.13`
4.  My shell’s git prompt says `((v1.0.13))`

Now things start to get a bit weirder! `.git/HEAD` disagrees with the other 3 indicators: `git status`, the git prompt, and what I checked out are all the same (`v1.0.13`), but `.git/HEAD` contains a commit ID.

The reason for this is that git is trying to help us out: commit IDs are kind of opaque, so if there’s a tag that corresponds to the current commit, `git status` will show us that instead.

Some notes about this:

*   If we check out the commit by its ID (`git checkout ca182053c7710a286d72`) instead of by its tag, what shows up in `git status` and in my shell prompt are exactly the same – git doesn’t actually “know” that we checked out a tag.
*   it looks like you can find the tags matching `HEAD` by running `git describe HEAD --tags --exact-match` (here’s the [fish git prompt code](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/blob/a5156e9e0e89bff2bd81ac945a019bad34f14346/share/functions/fish_git_prompt.fish#L521-L527))
*   You can see where `git-prompt.sh` added support for describing a commit by a tag in this way in commit [27c578885 in 2008](https://github.com/git/git/commit/27c578885a0b8f56430c5a24f558e2b45cf04a38).
*   I don’t know if it makes a difference whether the tag is annotated or not.
*   If there are 2 tags with the same commit ID, it gets a little weird. For example, if I add the tag `v1.0.12` to this commit so that it’s with both `v1.0.12` and `v1.0.13`, you can see here that my git prompt changes, and then the prompt and `git status` disagree about which tag to display:

```
bork@grapefruit ~/w/int-exposed ((v1.0.12))> git status
HEAD detached at v1.0.13 
```

(my prompt shows `v1.0.12` and `git status` shows `v1.0.13`)

### scenario 4: in the middle of a rebase

Now: what if I check out the `main` branch, do a rebase, but then there was a merge conflict in the middle of the rebase? Here’s the situation:

1.  `.git/HEAD` contains `c694cf8aabe2148b2299a988406f3395c0461742` (the commit ID of the commit that I’m rebasing onto, `origin/main` in this case)
2.  `git status` says `interactive rebase in progress; onto c694cf8`
3.  The thing I most recently checked out was `main`
4.  My shell’s git prompt says `(main|REBASE-i 1/1)`

Some notes about this:

*   I think that in some sense the “current branch” is `main` here – it’s what I most recently checked out, it’s what we’ll go back to after the rebase is done, and it’s where we’d go back to if I run `git rebase --abort`
*   in another sense, we’re in a detached HEAD state at `c694cf8aabe2`. But it doesn’t have the usual implications of being in “detached HEAD state” – if you make a commit, it won’t get orphaned! Instead, assuming you finish the rebase, it’ll get absorbed into the rebase and put somewhere in the middle of your branch.
*   it looks like during the rebase, the old “current branch” (`main`) is stored in `.git/rebase-merge/head-name`. Not totally sure about this though.

### scenario 5: right after `git init`

What about when we create an empty repository with `git init`?

1.  `.git/HEAD` contains `ref: refs/heads/main`
2.  `git status` says `On branch main` (and “No commits yet”)
3.  The thing I most recently checked out was, well, nothing
4.  My shell’s git prompt says: `(main)`

So here everything mostly lines up, except that we’ve never run `git checkout` or `git switch`. Basically Git automatically switches to whatever branch was configured in `init.defaultBranch`.

### scenario 6: a bare git repository

What if we clone a bare repository with `git clone --bare https://github.com/rbspy/rbspy`?

1.  `HEAD` contains `ref: refs/heads/main`
2.  `git status` says `fatal: this operation must be run in a work tree`
3.  The thing I most recently checked out was, well, nothing, `git checkout` doesn’t even work in bare repositories
4.  My shell’s git prompt says: `(BARE:main)`

So #1 and #4 match (they both agree that the current branch is “main”), but `git status` and `git checkout` don’t even work.

Some notes about this one:

*   I think `HEAD` in a bare repository mainly only really affects 1 thing: it’s the branch that gets checked out when you clone the repository. It’s also used when you run `git log`.
*   if you really want to, you can update `HEAD` in a bare repository to a different branch with `git symbolic-ref HEAD refs/heads/whatever`. I’ve never needed to do that though and it seems weird because `git symbolic ref` doesn’t check if the thing you’re pointing `HEAD` at is actually a branch that exists. Not sure if there’s a better way.

### all the results

Here’s a table with all of the results:

|  | `.git/HEAD` | git status | checked out | prompt |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1\. `checkout main` | `ref: refs/heads/main` | `On branch main` | main | `(main)` |
| 2\. `checkout 775b2b` | `775b2b399...` | `HEAD detached at 775b2b39` | 775b2b399 | `((775b2b39))` |
| 3\. `checkout v1.0.13` | `ca182053c...` | `HEAD detached at v1.0.13` | v1.0.13 | `((v1.0.13))` |
| 4\. inside rebase | `c694cf8aa...` | `interactive rebase in progress; onto c694cf8` | main | `(main\&#124;REBASE-i 1/1)` |
| 5\. after `git init` | `ref: refs/heads/main` | `On branch main` | n/a | `(main)` |
| 6\. bare repository | `ref: refs/heads/main` | `fatal: this operation must be run in a work tree` | n/a | `(BARE:main)` |

### “current branch” doesn’t seem completely well defined

My original instinct when talking about git was to agree with the git glossary and say that `HEAD` and the “current branch” mean the exact same thing.

But this doesn’t seem as ironclad as I used to think anymore! Some thoughts:

*   `.git/HEAD` is definitely the one with the most consistent format – it’s always either a branch or a commit ID. The others are all much messier
*   I have a lot more sympathy than I used to for the definition “the current branch is whatever you last checked out”. Git does a lot of work to remember which branch you last checked out (even if you’re currently doing a bisect or a merge or something else that temporarily moves HEAD off of that branch) and it feels weird to ignore that.
*   `git status` gives a lot of helpful context – these 5 status messages say a lot more than just what `HEAD` is set to currently
    1.  `on branch main`
    2.  `HEAD detached at 775b2b39`
    3.  `HEAD detached at v1.0.13`
    4.  `interactive rebase in progress; onto c694cf8`
    5.  `on branch main, no commits yet`

### some more “current branch” definitions

I’m going to try to collect some other definitions of the term `current branch` that I heard from people on Mastodon here and write some notes on them.

1.  “the branch that would be updated if i made a commit”
    *   Most of the time this is the same as `.git/HEAD`
    *   Arguably if you’re in the middle of a rebase, it’s different from `HEAD`, because ultimately that new commit will end up on the branch in `.git/rebase-merge/head-name`
2.  “the branch most git operations work against”
    *   This is sort of the same as what’s in `.git/HEAD`, except that some operations (like `git status`) will behave differently in some situations, like how `git status` won’t tell you the current branch if you’re in a bare repository

### on orphaned commits

One thing I noticed that wasn’t captured in any of this is whether the current commit is **orphaned** or not – the `git status` message (`HEAD detached from c694cf8`) is the same whether or not your current commit is orphaned.

I imagine this is because figuring out whether or not a given commit is orphaned might take a long time in a large repository: you can find out if the current commit is orphaned with `git branch --contains HEAD`, and that command takes about 500ms in a repository with 70,000 commits.

Git will warn you if the commit is orphaned (“Warning: you are leaving 1 commit behind, not connected to any of your branches…“) when you switch to a different branch though.

### that’s all!

I don’t have anything particularly smart to say about any of this. The more I think about git the more I can understand why people get confused.
