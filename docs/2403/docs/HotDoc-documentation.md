## HotDoc documentation

Hotdoc is a documentation framework. It provides an interface for extensions to plug upon, along with some base objects (formatters, ...)

Hotdoc is distributed with a set of extensions that perform various tasks, such as parsing C and extracting symbols with `clang`, parsing `gobject-introspection` (gir) files, highlighting the syntax of code snippets with `prism`, etc.
