We are specifically looking for engineers who can see inefficiencies in today’s developer workflows and want to improve developer experience for everyone. These engineers are self-motivated and opinionated about developer experience. We believe in the ethos of "Strong opinions loosely held".

Our interview process is designed to find these kinds of engineers. Moreover, we try to ask questions that are relevant to the types of products we build. Below is what to expect in our interview process.

### Intro call with founder

Get to know the product, vision and see if this will be a good fit

### Technical interviews

We love to do all technical interviews in a similar fashion. Depending on your timeline and our teams availability, these may be scheduled back to back or spaced out. You should expect a total of 3-4 technical interviews with a mix of programming + system design questions. Each interview is 1 hour long, with 45mins for technical question and 15 mins for Q&A.

All interviews involve you doing a screenshare of your IDE. We would recommend using your preferred IDE and your preferred programming language. You may also use Google search if you want to look for a specific reference. The goal here is to see how would you solve such problems in a typical workday.

### References

We strongly weigh on references and would ask for 2 references during or after the interviews. Please provide references of the folks you have directly worked with before - your former teammates, manager, etc.

### Timeline

We typically work with your timeline, we have even extended offers to the right candidates in a couple of days.
