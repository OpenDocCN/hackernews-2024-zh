A beta version of this tool will launch alongside the SDK on March 18\. The company says that users will begin to see apps popping up “within DMs, group chats and small servers.”

These updates come just two months after the company announced a brutal round of layoffs that impacted [](https://www.engadget.com/discord-lays-off-170-workers-in-latest-round-of-cuts-211541127.html).
