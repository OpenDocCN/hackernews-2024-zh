# Open Data Description Language (OpenDDL)

The Open Data Description Language (OpenDDL) is a general-purpose, human-readable, and strongly-typed data language for information exchange. It can be used for a wide range of applications that include everything from simple configuration files to the exchange of complex information among many programs in an editable format. It was originally developed as the basis for the [Open Game Engine Exchange format](http://opengex.org/).
