Problems started in the early hours and continued throughout the morning, but the company would not say how many stores were affected.

Sarah McLean, who owns a franchise across the Midlands, said that all of her 21 branches had been affected.

"My restaurants were impacted very early in the morning, so thankfully the impact wasn't too significant, about an hour and a half," she told the BBC. But during that time they "couldn't serve anyone".

Downdetector, a system used to monitor IT problems in businesses, noted a spike in issues with the McDonald's UK app from around 05:00 GMT on Friday.

Some social media users posted their discontent.

"@McDonaldsUK why can I order through the app this morning but all of my local McDonald's are closed when they are meant to be 24 hours?!" Tom Bennison in the East Midlands [posted on X, external](https://twitter.com/DrBennison/status/1768529009917251751), formerly Twitter.

Andrew Evans in Birmingham [posted, external](https://twitter.com/evansaviography/status/1768524522238419198): "Hmmm @McDonaldsUK my local is turning everyone away saying there's a national outage on your ordering system?"

Problems were reported in several countries, including New Zealand, Austria and Germany, but come the afternoon they were starting to get resolved.

Japanese news agency Kyodo reported that stores across Japan were beginning to resume operations following the system disruption.

McDonald's in Japan had earlier said: "There is currently a system failure. We apologise for any inconvenience this may cause and ask that you please wait for a while until the service is restored."

[Posting on X, external](https://twitter.com/TedsTechTed/status/1768533695177359808), Ted Anderson said he had gone into a restaurant in Japan to find it cash only and staff "calculating the totals on paper".

By 14:15 GMT, McDonald's Australia said all of its restaurants had re-opened.

"A huge thanks again to our wonderful customers and hard-working crew for your patience and support," it said.

In New Zealand, X user [Germin van Royen said, external](https://twitter.com/gerwinvanroyen/status/1768553490903908685): "The Mcdonalds outage is crazy. Went in tonight and drive thru + all kiosks were down. A system that can fail nation wide is bad but across multiple countries too!? Bonkers."

The fast food chain has about 40,000 restaurants worldwide, with around 1,450 restaurants across the UK and Ireland and more than 14,000 stores in the United States.

It operates nearly 3,000 across Japan and roughly 1,000 in Australia.
