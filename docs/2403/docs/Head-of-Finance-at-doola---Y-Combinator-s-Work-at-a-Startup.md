**What we're looking for**

doola, a YC-backed startup in New York City, is just entering our hypergrowth phase, and we're looking to make our first finance hire: our director of finance. We need a self-starting finance guru who can catapult doola to the next level by bringing the needed finance, GTM, and strategic pricing expertise to bear in this fast-moving, fun-but-chaotic environment. This is an ultra-high impact role with a real chance to leave a bigfoot-sized footprint in the company. Help us build New York's next unicorn!

**What you will do**

*   Serve as a strategic business partner to the CEO on a wide range of financial, strategic, operational, and organizational topics
*   Build trusted relationships as a key advisor to our Heads of Marketing, Growth, Product, Ops, and other members of the senior leadership team
*   Own the top-line growth forecasting process, pricing, GTM key performance indicators, and return on investment frameworks. Participate in the planning process across the company, including quarterly, annual, and long-term forecasting of the budget and long-range planning
*   Guide the development of a strong pricing capability to drive enhancements to the profitability of existing and new business lines. Establish a collaborative and credible Finance presence during the review of deals / fundraises
*   Strategically support ongoing financial analysis, including monthly and quarterly analyses at company-wide and department levels
*   Responsible for managing the end-to-end financial planning process, including owning the company operating model and individual department budgets
*   Build the financial infrastructure to help the company effectively scale and manage its resources for the best possible ROI
*   Develop frameworks for translating GTM strategy into measurable financial reporting with the goal of improving target setting for revenue and operating investments
*   Promote vision and strategy around process and systems to help support scale in a high-growth environment

*   Prepare insights and analytics for Monthly Business Review, Quarterly Business Review, and Board of Director reporting package materials
*   Drive alignment between Sales, Marketing, and Research & Development teams on Annual Recurring Revenue, new business targets, and capacity planning.
*   Play a driving role in investor relations with weekly and monthly investor updates, as well as building and sharing our annual operating plan.

**Who you are**

*   You're a problem solver. We don't care if you're 6 years out of school or it's been twenty years since you graduated.
*   6+ years of Financial Planning & Analysis or business finance experience in a high-growth environment
*   Bachelor‚Äôs Degree in Accounting, Finance, Business Administration, or similar STEM field required
*   Comfort working with ambiguity, and a demonstrated ability to adapt to changing circumstances and deliver results
*   You are personable, approachable, and able to collaborate constructively with each and every person on the team and throughout the business
*   Capable of operating independently - managing relationships, deliverables, and expectations with your business partners
*   Strong communication, analytical and problem-solving skills
*   Skilled at building pricing models to help automate and scale, build dashboards for seamless executive reviews
*   Highly analytical, strong attention to detail, and an ability to set and meet tight deadlines
*   You're a self-starter and get the startup grind. Work will be ambiguous at times, but the challenge of finding order in the chaos and working autonomously if needed excites you. You are proactive and do not need to be micromanaged. In other words, this is not the kind of job where you show up and are told *exactly* what to do every day.

**Compensation and benefits**

*   This is a full-time role with equity in the company and a competitive salary
*   Health insurance
*   Generous PTO / sick leave
