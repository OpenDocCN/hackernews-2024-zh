[The Great Green Wall](https://thegreatgreenwall.org/) being built in Africa to halt the southern progress of the Sahara Desert is a favorite public works project of mine — it’s massive, ambitious, long-term, important, and if it works, the effect will repay the cost [many times over](https://www.wfp.org/resilience-building). This video takes a quick look at some of the work being done on the wall in Senegal.
