An external hard drive or USB stick can be lost or damaged. The biggest advantage of storing files in the cloud is that they are available anytime, anywhere. In terms of security, you should always pay close attention to access and security with cloud backups.

## External Hard Disk Drives (HDD)

External hard drive backups are still quite popular. Please note that you **do not use a good backup method if you then keep the physical backup at home or on the same PC.** Safe storage of an external hard drive is important.

External hard drives are mainly used for data storage and PC backups. The biggest disadvantage of an external hard drive is that the hard drive can break down or get lost. Physical external hard drives are often not handled with care or they are collecting dust for too long. The biggest advantage is that the storage space only needs to be purchased once. It is also a nice addition to a cloud or online backup. Don’t forget to update your physical hard drive every year.

An external hard drive is usually available at web shops that sell other electrical hardware. You can purchase external hard drives from e-commerce platforms such as [Amazon.com](https://www.amazon.com/) and [BestBuy](https://www.bestbuy.com/).

## External Solid State Drive: (SSD)

The advantage of an SSD Backup vs an HDD Backup is faster access to data by using memory chips rather than a physical spinning disk that’s found in hard drives. : The speed difference between an SSD vs a hard drive is most apparent when copying and moving huge files. HDDs can copy 30 to 150 MB per second (MB/s), while standard SSDs perform the same action at speeds of 500 MB/s. (Source: Backblaze.com) Since SSDs don’t contain moving parts, they’re less prone to damage if you drop or bang your computer.

SSDs are usually available at web shops that sell other electrical hardware already mentioned above.</details> <details><summary>Computer Backup</summary>

Where you previously had freedom of choice regarding making a backup, and you could easily make multiple choices from the operating system on your computer. Now the PC operating systems are mainly promoting and integrating their own cloud services. However, there are still several options for making a backup. Before you go into business with a storage or backup service, you should only thoroughly familiarize yourself with the backup providers. This is partly due to the fact that you can no longer properly select these options from, for example, Windows itself.

Creating a Computer / PC Backup with Windows operating system

*   Make a backup of your PC on an external (and connected) hard drive via **“Backup Settings”**.
*   Make a backup of your PC on OneDrive via **“Settings for Backups”**.

(1*) So is your iCloud account stolen or hacked? Then you can still lose everything. In addition, these backups pushed from operating systems are often stored in the cloud storage of expensive services, there are cheaper alternatives!

**How ​​do you solve this?**

Super easy.. Use another cloud storage or backup party for backups of your crucial files. Various backup services provide additional security and safe distance from the original files.

Obviously, there are more methods for making backups. Both online and offline. Actually, there are too many topics to deal with per device, but we will mention most of them here briefly:

**Backup via USB stick**
One of the old and still effective methods is to use a **USB stick**, this is an easy method. Insert the USB stick into the Computer or Laptop and drag the files you want to save on the USB stick to the correct folder.

**Backup from a MAC**
Go to System Preferences and then Time Machine and follow the instructions within the Time Machine application to backup your Mac.

**Back up your Website**
If you want to make a backup of your website, open the file manager via the web hosting company or via an FTP server. Copy all folders from the website to a folder on the hard disk or to a cloud storage provider.

**Back up Whatsapp**
Whatsapp can be backed up via the export functionality or via the backup function, these backups (outside the export) can only be saved with the operating system. So iCloud with iPhones and with Android to Google Drive.

**Secure Encrypted Backup Solutions**
When you have sensitive data you need to back up consider using data-encrypted backup solutions. The [Whitehouse](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Memo-What-We-Urge-You-To-Do-To-Protect-Against-The-Threat-of-Ransomware.pdf) recently said the following regarding using data encrypted backup solutions:

*“Back up your data, system images, and configurations, regularly test them, and keep the backups offline: Ensure that backups are regularly tested and that they are not connected to the business network, as many ransomware variants try to find and encrypt or delete accessible backups. Maintaining current backups offline is critical because if your network data is encrypted with ransomware, your organization can restore systems.”*</details> [Take the pledge](#)
