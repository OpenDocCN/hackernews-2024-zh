# CACM Is Now Open Access – Communications of the ACM

> 来源：[https://cacm.acm.org/news/cacm-is-now-open-access-2/](https://cacm.acm.org/news/cacm-is-now-open-access-2/)

We are excited to announce that *Communications of the ACM* (*CACM*) is now a fully **Open Access publication**. This means that more than six decades of *CACM*’s renowned research articles, seminal papers, technical reports, commentaries, real-world practice, and news articles are now open to everyone, regardless of whether they are members of ACM or subscribe to the ACM Digital Library.

But why this change, and why now? For almost 65 years, the contents of *CACM* have been exclusively accessible to ACM members and individuals affiliated with institutions that subscribe to either *CACM* or the ACM Digital Library. In 2020, ACM announced its intention to transition to a fully Open Access publisher within a roughly five-year timeframe (January 2026) under a financially sustainable model. The transition is going well: By the end of 2023, approximately 40% of the ~26,000 articles ACM publishes annually were being published Open Access utilizing the [ACM Open](https://libraries.acm.org/subscriptions-access/acmopen#model) model. As ACM has progressed toward this goal, it has increasingly opened large parts of the ACM Digital Library, including more than 100,000 articles published between 1951–2000\. It is ACM’s plan to open its entire archive of over 600,000 articles when the transition to full Open Access is complete.

As part of this transition and to coincide with the launch of *CACM*‘s new website, all *CACM* articles, past, present, and future, will be published in front of the subscription paywall. 

By opening *CACM* to the world, ACM hopes to increase engagement with the broader computer science community and encourage non-members to discover its rich resources and the benefits of joining the largest professional computer science organization. This move will also benefit CACM authors by expanding their readership to a larger and more diverse audience. Of course, the community’s continued support of ACM through membership and the ACM Open model is essential to keeping ACM and *CACM* strong, so it is critical that current members continue their membership and authors encourage their institutions to join the ACM Open model to keep this effort sustainable. 

We invite everyone to explore CACM’s vast collection of articles, columns, and news items on the new website. Thank you for your interest in ACM and *CACM*!
