# A review of zero-day in-the-wild exploits in 2023

In 2023, Google observed 97 zero-day vulnerabilities exploited in-the-wild. That’s over 50 percent more than in 2022, but still shy of 2021’s record of 106\. Today, Google published its fifth annual review of zero-days exploited in-the-wild, marking the first time Google’s Threat Analysis Group (TAG) and Mandiant teamed up on the report.

In the report, “[We’re All in this Together: A Year in Review of Zero-Days Exploited In-the-Wild in 2023](https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/documents/Year_in_Review_of_ZeroDays.pdf),” released today, we’re taking a broader look at this space with recommendations for others. TAG and Mandiant combined their expertise to analyze zero-days that were actively exploited against both end-user platforms and products (e.g. mobile devices, operating systems, browsers, and other applications) and enterprise-focused technologies such as security software and appliances.

The result, we hope, is not only a broader assessment but clear guidance for others committed to securing the digital world.
