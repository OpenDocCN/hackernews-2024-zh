# How HEAD works in git

> 来源：[https://jvns.ca/blog/2024/03/08/how-head-works-in-git/](https://jvns.ca/blog/2024/03/08/how-head-works-in-git/)

Hello! The other day I ran a Mastodon poll asking people how confident they were that they understood how HEAD works in Git. The results (out of 1700 votes) were a little surprising to me:

*   10% “100%”
*   36% “pretty confident”
*   39% “somewhat confident?”
*   15% “literally no idea”

I was surprised that people were so unconfident about their understanding – I’d been thinking of `HEAD` as a pretty straightforward topic.

Usually when people say that a topic is confusing when I think it’s not, the reason is that there’s actually some hidden complexity that I wasn’t considering. And after some follow up conversations, it turned out that `HEAD` actually *was* a bit more complicated than I’d appreciated!

Here’s a quick table of contents:

### HEAD is actually a few different things

After talking to a bunch of different people about `HEAD`, I realized that `HEAD` actually has a few different closely related meanings:

1.  The file `.git/HEAD`
2.  `HEAD` as in `git show HEAD` (git calls this a “revision parameter”)
3.  All of the ways git uses `HEAD` in the output of various commands (`<<<<<<<<<<HEAD`, `(HEAD -> main)`, `detached HEAD state`, `On branch main`, etc)

These are extremely closely related to each other, but I don’t think the relationship is totally obvious to folks who are starting out with git.

### the file `.git/HEAD`

Git has a very important file called `.git/HEAD`. The way this file works is that it contains either:

1.  The name of a **branch** (like `ref: refs/heads/main`)
2.  A **commit ID** (like `96fa6899ea34697257e84865fefc56beb42d6390`)

This file is what determines what your “current branch” is in Git. For example, when you run `git status` and see this:

```
$ git status
On branch main 
```

it means that the file `.git/HEAD` contains `ref: refs/heads/main`.

If `.git/HEAD` contains a commit ID instead of a branch, git calls that “detached HEAD state”. We’ll get to that later.

(People will sometimes say that HEAD contains a name of a **reference** or a commit ID, but I’m pretty sure that that the reference has to be a **branch**. You *can* technically make `.git/HEAD` contain the name of a reference that isn’t a branch by manually editing `.git/HEAD`, but I don’t think you can do it with a regular git command. I’d be interested to know if there is a regular-git-command way to make .git/HEAD a non-branch reference though, and if so why you might want to do that!)

### `HEAD` as in `git show HEAD`

It’s very common to use `HEAD` in git commands to refer to a commit ID, like:

*   `git diff HEAD`
*   `git rebase -i HEAD^^^^`
*   `git diff main..HEAD`
*   `git reset --hard HEAD@{2}`

All of these things (`HEAD`, `HEAD^^^`, `HEAD@{2}`) are called “revision parameters”. They’re documented in [man gitrevisions](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitrevisions), and Git will try to resolve them to a commit ID.

(I’ve honestly never actually heard the term “revision parameter” before, but that’s the term that’ll get you to the documentation for this concept)

HEAD in `git show HEAD` has a pretty simple meaning: it resolves to the **current commit** you have checked out! Git resolves `HEAD` in one of two ways:

1.  if `.git/HEAD` contains a branch name, it’ll be the latest commit on that branch (for example by reading it from `.git/refs/heads/main`)
2.  if `.git/HEAD` contains a commit ID, it’ll be that commit ID

### next: all the output formats

Now we’ve talked about the file `.git/HEAD`, and the “revision parameter” `HEAD`, like in `git show HEAD`. We’re left with all of the various ways git uses `HEAD` in its output.

### `git status`: “on branch main” or “HEAD detached”

When you run `git status`, the first line will always look like one of these two:

1.  `on branch main`. This means that `.git/HEAD` contains a branch.
2.  `HEAD detached at 90c81c72`. This means that `.git/HEAD` contains a commit ID.

I promised earlier I’d explain what “HEAD detached” means, so let’s do that now.

### detached HEAD state

“HEAD is detached” or “detached HEAD state” mean that you have no current branch.

Having no current branch is a little dangerous because if you make new commits, those commits won’t be attached to any branch – they’ll be orphaned! Orphaned commits are a problem for 2 reasons:

1.  the commits are more difficult to find (you can’t run `git log somebranch` to find them)
2.  orphaned commits will eventually be deleted by git’s garbage collection

Personally I’m very careful about avoiding creating commits in detached HEAD state, though some people [prefer to work that way](https://github.com/arxanas/git-branchless). Getting out of detached HEAD state is pretty easy though, you can either:

1.  Go back to a branch (`git checkout main`)
2.  Create a new branch at that commit (`git checkout -b newbranch`)
3.  If you’re in detached HEAD state because you’re in the middle of a rebase, finish or abort the rebase (`git rebase --abort`)

Okay, back to other git commands which have `HEAD` in their output!

### `git log`: `(HEAD -> main)`

When you run `git log` and look at the first line, you might see one of the following 3 things:

1.  `commit 96fa6899ea (HEAD -> main)`
2.  `commit 96fa6899ea (HEAD, main)`
3.  `commit 96fa6899ea (HEAD)`

It’s not totally obvious how to interpret these, so here’s the deal:

*   inside the `(...)`, git lists every reference that points at that commit, for example `(HEAD -> main, origin/main, origin/HEAD)` means `HEAD`, `main`, `origin/main`, and `origin/HEAD` all point at that commit (either directly or indirectly)
*   `HEAD -> main` means that your current branch is `main`
*   If that line says `HEAD,` instead of `HEAD ->`, it means you’re in detached HEAD state (you have no current branch)

if we use these rules to explain the 3 examples above: the result is:

1.  `commit 96fa6899ea (HEAD -> main)` means:
    *   `.git/HEAD` contains `ref: refs/heads/main`
    *   `.git/refs/heads/main` contains `96fa6899ea`
2.  `commit 96fa6899ea (HEAD, main)` means:
    *   `.git/HEAD` contains `96fa6899ea` (HEAD is “detached”)
    *   `.git/refs/heads/main` also contains `96fa6899ea`
3.  `commit 96fa6899ea (HEAD)` means:
    *   `.git/HEAD` contains `96fa6899ea` (HEAD is “detached”)
    *   `.git/refs/heads/main` either contains a different commit ID or doesn’t exist

### merge conflicts: `<<<<<<< HEAD` is just confusing

When you’re resolving a merge conflict, you might see something like this:

```
<<<<<<< HEAD
def parse(input):
    return input.split("\n")
=======
def parse(text):
    return text.split("\n\n")
>>>>>>> somebranch 
```

I find `HEAD` in this context extremely confusing and I basically just ignore it. Here’s why.

*   When you do a **merge**, `HEAD` in the merge conflict is the same as what `HEAD` was when you ran `git merge`. Simple.
*   When you do a **rebase**, `HEAD` in the merge conflict is something totally different: it’s the **other commit** that you’re rebasing on top of. So it’s totally different from what `HEAD` was when you ran `git rebase`. It’s like this because rebase works by first checking out the other commit and then repeatedly cherry-picking commits on top of it.

Similarly, the meaning of “ours” and “theirs” are flipped in a merge and rebase.

The fact that the meaning of `HEAD` changes depending on whether I’m doing a rebase or merge is really just too confusing for me and I find it much simpler to just ignore `HEAD` entirely and use another method to figure out which part of the code is which.

### some thoughts on consistent terminology

I think HEAD would be more intuitive if git’s terminology around HEAD were a little more internally consistent.

For example, git talks about “detached HEAD state”, but never about “attached HEAD state” – git’s documentation never uses the term “attached” at all to refer to `HEAD`. And git talks about being “on” a branch, but never “not on” a branch.

So it’s very hard to guess that `on branch main` is actually the opposite of `HEAD detached`. How is the user supposed to guess that `HEAD detached` has anything to do with branches at all, or that “on branch main” has anything to do with `HEAD`?

### that’s all!

If I think of other ways `HEAD` is used in Git (especially ways HEAD appears in Git’s output), I might add them to this post later.

If you find HEAD confusing, I hope this helps a bit!
