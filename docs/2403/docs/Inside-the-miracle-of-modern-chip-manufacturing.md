# Inside the miracle of modern chip manufacturing

Creating the tiny components for a chip’s circuits requires cutting-edge equipment: machines that can transfer microscopic patterns on to each wafer using a process called photolithography.

For the smallest chips, multi-million-dollar machines made by a single Dutch company, ASML, use extreme ultraviolet light to create these fine stencils. The machines are the size of a bus, but so accurate they could direct a laser to hit a golf ball as far away as the Moon.

Every stage of this process requires “PhD thesis level of knowledge”, says Koch.

A wafer full of chips can be worth thousands of pounds when it leaves a top fabrication plant.

## Rethinking power and packaging

While leading manufacturers are hoping the 2nm chip will solve many of the 3nm generation’s problems, the limits of scaling mean engineers are already developing alternative ways of getting more power and efficiency out of the same space.

Building on current 3D designs, engineers plan to stack transistors on top of each other, rather than cramming them in side-by-side.

“You’re really starting to expand that third dimension, which is something that hasn’t been used in the first 60 years of transistor technology,” says Intel’s Auth. “[When] you build skyscrapers, you start to run out of the ability to shrink things laterally, so you start to build up and that’s what we’re doing.”

The way chips are packaged is also going upwards. The growing field of “advanced packaging” — how chips are bundled together to boost capability as well as reduce cost — is moving towards stacking chips to improve performance and better use available space.

This pivot to vertical design and development is “kind of a big deal”, says Koch of SemiAnalysis, because it is the first time the industry has acknowledged that it’s running out of horizontal options. “We’re slowing down in one direction, but speeding up in another,” he says.

Cao says advanced packaging is where major progress can be made — a field in which TSMC is heavily invested. “There are a lot of different configurations that can be used . . . a lot of things are happening in this field.”

Packaging developments have paved the way for another shift in semiconductor architecture: “chiplets”.

Engineers are moving away from building an entire microprocessor on a single piece of silicon — the monolithic “system on a chip” — and towards multi-chip modules (MCMs). These MCMs see groups of chips with different functions built on separate pieces of silicon and then bundled together to work like a single electronic brain.
