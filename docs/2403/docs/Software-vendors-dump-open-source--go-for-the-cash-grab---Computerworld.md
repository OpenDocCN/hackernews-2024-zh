# Software vendors dump open source, go for the cash grab – Computerworld

Redis is far from the only company to make such a move. Last year,  [HashiCorp](https://www.hashicorp.com/) dumped its main program Terraform’s [Mozilla Public License (MPL)](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/MPL/) for the [Business Source License (BSL) 1.1](https://www.hashicorp.com/bsl). Here, the name of the new license game is to prevent anyone from competing with Terraform.

Would it surprise you to learn that not long after this, [HashiCorp started shopping itself around for a buyer?](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-03-15/software-company-hashicorp-is-said-to-weigh-potential-sale?sref=y7UfZ5i4) It didn’t surprise me.

Before this latest round of license changes, MongoDB and Elastic made similar shifts. Again, you might never have heard of these companies or their programs, but each is worth, at a minimum, hundreds of millions of dollars. And, while you might not know it, if your company uses cloud services behind the scenes, chances are you’re using one or more of their programs,

There is a threefold reason these companies did this. First, all of them, at one point or another, mistook “open source” as a business model. It wasn’t then, it isn’t now, and it never will be.

Second, having made that first mistake, they discovered the hard way that while they could make millions, other companies, usually the hyper-cloud providers such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), were making just as much, if not more, from their programs. They did it by providing their software as a service to businesses. 

It’s a matter of scale. People want to use the software as a service, not as a one-off they need to work on themselves.
