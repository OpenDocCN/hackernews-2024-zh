## About Us

At Sugar Labs, we make a collection of tools that learners use to explore, discover, create, and reflect. We are non-profit and led by volunteers. We distribute these tools freely and encourage our users to appropriate them, taking ownership and responsibility for their learning. Sugar Labs, a volunteer-driven, non-profit organization, had its origins in the One Laptop per Child project. The mission of Sugar Labs is to support the Sugar community of users and developers and establish regional, autonomous “Sugar Labs” around the world to help learners “learn how to learn” by tailoring Sugar to local languages and curricula.
