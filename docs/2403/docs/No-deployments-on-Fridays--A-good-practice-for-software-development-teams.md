# No deployments on Fridays: A good practice for software development teams

Deploying new code to production can be a stressful experience, especially if it's done at the end of the week. That's why many software development teams follow a practice called "no deployments on Fridays."

There are a few reasons why this is a good practice. First, it gives teams more time to test and troubleshoot their code before it goes live. Second, it reduces the risk of deploying code that contains bugs or errors. Third, it gives team members more time to relax and enjoy their weekends without having to worry about work.

Of course, there are some cases where it may be necessary to deploy code on a Friday. For example, if a critical bug is discovered, or if a new feature is absolutely needed for the business. However, in general, it's best to avoid deploying code on Fridays if possible.

## Tips for a "no deployments on Fridays" policy

*   **Plan your deployments ahead of time.** This will give you plenty of time to test and troubleshoot your code before the end of the week.
*   **Set up a continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipeline.** This will automate your testing and deployment process, making it easier to deploy code quickly and safely.
*   **Have a rollback plan in place.** In case something goes wrong with a deployment, you should be able to quickly roll back to the previous version of your code.
*   **Communicate your policy to your team and stakeholders**. This will help everyone understand why you're following a "no deployments on Fridays" policy and what to expect.

Following a "no deployments on Fridays" policy can help you reduce stress, improve your code quality, and protect your business from costly outages.

## Benefits of no deployments on Fridays

Here are some of the benefits of following a "no deployments on Fridays" policy:

*   **Reduces stress:** Deploying new code to production can be a stressful experience, especially if it's done at the end of the week. By following a "no deployments on Fridays" policy, teams can reduce their stress levels and focus on other tasks.
*   **Improves code quality:** Having more time to test and troubleshoot code before it's deployed can help to improve code quality. This can lead to fewer bugs and errors, which can save teams time and money in the long run.
*   **Protects businesses from costly outages:** Deploying code that contains bugs or errors can lead to costly outages. By following a "no deployments on Fridays" policy, teams can reduce the risk of deploying code that contains bugs and errors.

## Challenges of no deployments on Fridays

There are a few challenges that teams may face when following a "no deployments on Fridays" policy:

*   **Pressure to deploy code:** In some cases, teams may feel pressure to deploy code on a Friday, even if they don't have enough time to test it thoroughly. It's important for teams to resist this pressure and stick to their policy of no deployments on Fridays.
*   **Unexpected problems:** Sometimes, unexpected problems can arise that require teams to deploy code on a Friday. For example, a critical bug may be discovered, or a new feature may be absolutely needed for the business. In these cases, teams should carefully weigh the risks and benefits of deploying code on a Friday before making a decision.
*   **Communicating the policy:** It's important for teams to communicate their "no deployments on Fridays" policy to their team and stakeholders. This will help everyone understand why the policy is in place and what to expect.

## Conclusion

Following a "no deployments on Fridays" policy can help software development teams reduce stress, improve their code quality, and protect their businesses from costly outages. While there are some challenges that teams may face when following this policy, the benefits outweigh the risks.
