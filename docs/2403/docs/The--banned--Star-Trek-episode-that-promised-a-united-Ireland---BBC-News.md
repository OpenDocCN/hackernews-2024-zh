# The 'banned' Star Trek episode that promised a united Ireland - BBC News

There is some murkiness about how a decision was reached not to broadcast the programme at the time.

BBC Archives confirmed the 2007 broadcast of the episode and was "satisfied" any other screening would have been listed.

The BBC's press office said it had spoken to "a number of people" about why a ban may have been implemented, but was unable to get this information "as it dates quite far back".

A spokesman for Sky said he had looked into it, but could not confirm it had broadcast an edited version of the episode in 1992 - or what its reasoning might have been for doing so.

RTÉ noted that TV guides from the time show it had broadcast Star Trek: The Next Generation, but did not have further information in its acquisitions system, and could not find anyone from the time to speak to.

"I think this would probably have stirred a memory if I had been made aware of this at the time, but I am afraid it rings no bells at all," said Lord John Birt, who was director general of the BBC from 1992 to 2000, and before this served as deputy director general.

If the episode had been removed, it would probably have been a decision made at operational level in Network Television, he said.

More than three decades on, the picture in Northern Ireland has changed.

Ms Snodgrass says she was "thrilled" when the Good Friday Agreement was signed, adding it had allowed Northern Ireland to prosper.

She notes Games of Thrones, a television series based on books by George RR Martin (who she knows well and [has co-authored work with, external](https://melindasnodgrass.com/)) was filmed in the region in recent years - something which has given [a big boost to the economy](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/resources/idt-sh/Beyond_the_Throne).

"[At the time] 2024 seemed a long way away. I probably should have made it, you know, 2224! I just pulled that number and it didn't occur to me that suddenly we would be here."
