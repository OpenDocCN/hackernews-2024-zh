Besides the initial price, which was too high, one of the reasons this place didn’t appeal to most potential buyers is that it didn’t show well. Buyers have gotten used to carefully staged listings with virtual 3D tours and professional photography. (I use those myself when appealing to prospective tenants. It’s money well spent.) Most buyers simply can’t see past other people’s furniture, decor, or outdated fixtures.

Here’s a news flash - most of that stuff goes away when the sellers or their tenants move out. What’s actually for sale is the structure and the dirt under it. This particular building isn’t perfect, but the things that are wrong with it are relatively simple to fix and can be addressed incrementally in a cost effective manner.

Other potential buyers were scared off by the existence of tenants. Being a landlord isn’t always fun, but it isn’t rocket science once you learn the basics. Tenants can be an asset rather than a problem if you approach the situation correctly. Even if the eventual goal is to vacate the premises it can be done peacefully where everyone ultimately gets what they need.

But mostly, people in search of a typical single family home just skip past these kinds of properties entirely. An old 1950s duplex doesn’t fit the image they have inside their heads. That’s a shame because these kinds of properties are real problem solvers, especially for people on a tight budget.
