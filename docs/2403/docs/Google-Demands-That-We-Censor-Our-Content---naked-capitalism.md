# Google Demands That We Censor Our Content | naked capitalism

Sorry to hear this. I am a mere 1L and not licensed to practice law, but offer my research skills if needed.

The most promising cases to stop big tech censorship are *Kennedy v. Biden* and *Missouri v. Biden*,

In both cases, the plaintiffs were able to get an injunction against the government to prevent the CDC, HHS, and other agencies from communicating with Google, Twitter, and other tech co. to censor private speech.

The issue in Kennedy v. Biden is: can a state actor be held responsible for a private decision made by a tech company when that tech company has been induced, encouraged, or promoted to violate a constitutional right?

The court reasoned:

> The State (i.e., the Government) can be held responsible for a private decision only when
> it has exercised coercive power or has provided such “significant encouragement,” either overtly
> or covertly, that the choice must be deemed to be that of the State.

Further:

> A state may not induce, encourage, or promote
> private persons to accomplish what it is constitutionally forbidden to accomplish

RFK Jr. was able to show harm, in that his posts on social media were censored, and he was deplatformed. The Children’s Health Defense network also was a plaintiff. They experienced similar censorship at the hands of the defendants.

The bad news is that both cases got consolidated and are headed to the SCOTUS, so the preliminary injunctions were stayed. It will be fascinating to see what happens in the SCOTUS with such a substantial case on free speech and interference by government actors.

Your hypothetical case is distinguished by the fact that rather than being directly censored on social media, you’re being attacked in the pocketbook through Google ads de-monetization. A similar thing happened to Karl Denninger’s ticker forum, which I occasionally read. He had to split his blog into two sections, one that acquiesced to Google’s demands, and a non-ad-supported section with a free-speech safe space.

As an aside, and not legal analysis, I find the Republicans utterly useless here. They know damn well this crap is going on and won’t lift a finger to legislate or put policy riders in the appropriations bills. They have a golden opportunity – right now all Federal agencies including the FBI are on a CR. Stick a rider in there to ban this crap. Make Google pay a fine of $10M for every complaint from a private citizen that their free speech was censored, as a matter of public policy. Watch this crap stop.

Where are Margorie Taylor-Greene and Rand Paul? MIA.
