# What a $1 deal says about America's office market - BBC News

Across the street, small healthcare firms have almost filled up a building that was recently redone with help from city tax breaks.

Next door, at 360 Park Avenue South, a restaurant and one firm have committed to lease space and owner Boston Properties has said it expects the building to be nearly full again by the end of next year.

The tech firms that once drove demand in the area have retreated, but Peter Turchin, vice chairman at property firm CBRE and the leasing agent for the building, says he's still seeing interest from financial and legal firms, which have recalled staff to the office and are ready to pay for top-tier space.

"I don't think it has wider significance at all," he says of the $1 deal. "We're quite busy."

The firm that sold its stake, which invests funds for the Canadian pension plan, declined to comment.

Mr Yavrodi remains sceptical.

Even if the space gets rented, just 12% of Manhattan's office workers are estimated to be showing up in person five days a week.

He says that is simply not enough to sustain retail businesses like his - especially since so many firms are using free or heavily subsidised food to try to make back-to-office orders easier to swallow.

After shrinking his workforce from 12 to five, switching up his menu, and expanding deliveries, he sees little anyone can do to address the problem.

"Everybody has different ideas but they are trying to put a bandage on a big cut when they need heavy-duty stitches," he says.

"The way of life for the offices, as it was before the pandemic, is never going to come back."
