At Artisan, we're on a mission to create the most advanced human-like digital workers, called Artisans, and the software operating system for startups across verticals. We're starting with sales through our Artisan Sales platform and Ava, The Sales Rep Artisan.

Our first Artisan, Ava, is a BDR who automates the entire outbound sales process and can be set up with a 10-minute conversation. Ava creates the user's ICP, prospects with her database of over 270M contacts, does lead research, crafts & sends highly bespoke email sequences, and books meetings into sales reps' calendars.

We recently launched Artisan Labs, our research lab where we're pioneering the foundational technologies required to create human-like digital workers.

This is the next Industrial Revolution.
