Georgiana gave her pictures descriptive titles: *Study of Curves*, *A Little More Design*, *Still More Design*, *Cecil’s Fruit*, *Zilla’s Flower*. Some of them are grouped into series of flowers, or the names of friends and family members she contacted via her mediumship; her dead siblings and her first guide Henry Lenny, H.R.H. the late Prince Consort, H.R.H. Victoria, Princess Royal of England, and artists including William Blake, Caravaggio, Correggio, Bartolomé Murillo, Titian, and seventy archangels. Via her guides, she explored subjects such as The Trinity, God, Spirit, Peace, Wisdom, and the Unveiling of the Heavens. Along with self-portraits, she drew some of her fellow mediums and other living people close to her.
