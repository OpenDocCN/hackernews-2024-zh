of the Basic Education requirements to be considered for this position. Qualifying international Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) education is allowed as long as you submit proof of appropriate foreign education equivalency (see below for foreign education details).

To verify the education requirement, you must submit copies of official or non-official transcripts with your application showing a related STEM major field and date conferred, or Test Pilot School certification/enrollment from a nationally or internationally recognized program.

**While a bachelor's degree (or less) is not qualifying alone, you must submit ALL STEM related transcripts with your application.**

The following degree fields, while related to engineering and the sciences, are

**NOT**

considered qualifying:

*   Degrees in Technology (Engineering Technology, Aviation Technology, Medical Technology, etc.)
*   Degrees in Psychology (except for Clinical Psychology, Physiological Psychology, or Experimental Psychology, which are qualifying)
*   Degrees in Nursing
*   Degrees in Exercise Physiology or similar fields
*   Degrees in Social Sciences (Geography, Anthropology, Archaeology, etc.)
*   Degrees in Aviation, Aviation Management, or similar fields

**You must meet the Basic Education Requirement through one of the methods described below:

A.**

You must have completed a master's degree (or foreign equivalent) in an accredited college or university with major study in an appropriate technical field of engineering, biological science, physical science, computer science, or mathematics. (You must submit copies of official or non-official transcripts with your application showing major field and date degree was conferred.)

***OR*** **B.**

You must have completed at least two years (36 semester hours or 54 quarter hours) in an accredited Ph.D. or related doctoral degree program (or foreign equivalent) with major study in an appropriate technical field of engineering, biological science, physical science, computer science, or mathematics. (You must submit copies of official or non-official transcripts with your application showing major field of study and completed credit hours.)

***OR*** **C.**

You must have completed an M.D., D.O. or related medical degree (or foreign equivalent) in an accredited college or university. (You must submit copies of official or non-official transcripts with your application showing date degree conferred.)

If TPS is your only advanced technical degree, you must have also completed a bachelor's degree or higher (or foreign equivalent) at an accredited college or university with major study in an appropriate technical field of engineering, biological science, physical science, computer science, or mathematics. (You must submit copies of official or non-official transcripts with your application showing major field and date degree conferred)

**SUB-DISCIPLINE SPECIALIZED EXPERIENCE REQUIREMENT**

In addition to the

**Basic Education**

requirement, all applicants must meet the

**Sub-Discipline** **Specialized Experience**

requirements below under one of the designated sub-disciplines:

*Pilots, Flight Test, Medical Doctors, Biological and Medical Sciences, Physical Sciences, and Engineering and Operations.*

You should select the discipline you

**best qualify**

for based on the majority of your work experience.

**For each discipline, applicants must have a minimum of 3 years (or 1,000 Pilot-in-Command hours with at least 850 hours in high performance jet aircraft for Pilots) of progressively responsible, professional experience after the completion of appropriate technical field degree(s). **Experience could have been gained after the completion of a qualifying bachelor's degree, though this does not negate the requirement to still possess a higher-level degree.****

While you may qualify for multiple disciplines, only

**one**

selection below is permitted. Teaching experience, including experience at the K-12 levels, is acceptable if it was in a related technical field and you also meet the initial education requirement.

**Specialized Experience** **A. **Pilot Discipline**** **-**

to qualify, you must:

*   Have at least 1,000 hours of Pilot-In-Command time:
    *   A minimum of 850 hours must be in a high-performance jet aircraft. The remaining hours may be accumulated in aircraft other than high-performance jet aircraft. (**Please** **annotate total hours of high-performance jet aircraft demonstrated in resume**)
*   Complete the Pilot Qualifications Form using the following link and attach as a supporting document to your application - [Pilot Qualifications Form](https://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/atoms/files/jf603_summary_of_aeronautical_experience.pdf)

***OR*** **B. Flight Test Discipline -**

to qualify, you must:

*   Have completed or be currently enrolled in a Test Pilot School program (nationally or internationally recognized) and will have completed this program by June 2025 **(Must submit proof of completion or enrollment).**
*   Have at least 3 years of professional experience after degree completion in a field related to Flight Test. You must certify that this experience was gained in a field related to this sub-discipline and be able to provide additional certification upon request. (**Must be demonstrated in resume**)
    *   **Note:** Flight Test includes other military experience outside Pilot-in-Command experience or aircraft experience that does not qualify for the Pilot discipline. For example, flight test engineers; helicopter pilots; pilots of non-high performance jet aircraft; navigators, weapons systems officers/operators, back-seat qualified fliers, or other aircraft-related positions that may have led to the completion of Test Pilot School. Applicants with test experience but who have not enrolled in or completed Test Pilot School should select the Engineering and Operations sub-discipline.
