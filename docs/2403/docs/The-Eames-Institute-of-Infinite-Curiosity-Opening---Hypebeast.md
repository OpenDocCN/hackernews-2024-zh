While there were many couples that defined 20th century art and design, one could argue that none had the lasting impact on the present generation of creatives as Charles and Ray [Eames](https://hypebeast.com/tags/eames-office). From their universally beloved furniture that continues to resonate with today’s sensibilities to their mind-churning short film, [*Powers of Ten* (1977)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fKBhvDjuy0), one of the core pillars to the Eames’ design philosophy rested on the experiences and interactions that would come from their furnishings.

Nestled about an hour northeast of San Francisco in the town of Richmond, The Eames Institute of Infinite Curiosity houses over 40,000 artifacts from the duo’s esteemed collection, and for the first time, it will be open for public viewing. From Molded Plywood Chairs (LCW) and supple leather Lounge Chairs to multi-color Storage Units, the space is a treasure trove for design fans who want to learn about the Eames’ full breadth of work in one location.

Llisa Demetrios, who is the granddaughter of Charles and Ray Eames and the institute’s chief curator, will be guiding visitors around the space, which runs from Wednesday to Friday. Book your visit [here](https://www.eamesinstitute.org/visit/).
