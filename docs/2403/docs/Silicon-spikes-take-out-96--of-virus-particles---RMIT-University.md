Study first author, Samson Mah, who completed the work under an RMIT-CSIRO Masters by Research Scholarship and has now progressed to working on his PhD research with the team, said he was inspired by the practical potential of the research.

“Implementing this cutting-edge technology in high-risk environments like laboratories or healthcare facilities, where exposure to hazardous biological materials is a concern, could significantly bolster containment measures against infectious diseases,” he said. 

“By doing so, we aim to create safer environments for researchers, healthcare professionals, and patients alike.”  

The project was a truly interdisciplinary and multi-institutional collaboration carried out over two years, involving researchers from RMIT, URV (Spain), CSIRO, Swinburne University, Monash University and the Kaiteki Institute (Japan).

The [RMIT-CSIRO Masters by Research Program](https://www.rmit.edu.au/students/careers-opportunities/scholarships/research/rmit-csiro-masters-by-research) allows students to work with CSIRO and RMIT on a range of projects across science, engineering and health disciplines.
