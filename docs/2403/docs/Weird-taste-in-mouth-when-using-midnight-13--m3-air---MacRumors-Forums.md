# Weird taste in mouth when using midnight 13" m3 air | MacRumors Forums

OK, this is gonna sound crazy, but after using my 13 inch MacBook Air, M3 in 'midnight' for 10 minutes or longer, I begin to notice a weird taste in my mouth, slightly grainy and metallic. I can't tell if I might be inhaling some fumes from it, or I am absorbing some chemicals from the finish through my hands (midnight w/ anodization). I have other MacBooks in the house (none in this finish or generation), and have never experienced this before.

I have also reproduce this by stopping use and re-starting on and off, and the taste immediately comes back!

thoughts? am I alone? LOL

**UPDATE & SOLUTION: after scrubbing the MacBook body hard a few times with a rag and Isopropyl alcohol, the keyboard area and body of my machine, this appear to solve the issue. sharing in case others find this thread in the future.**
