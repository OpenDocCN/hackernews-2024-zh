# I miss the dumb stuff I used to write, and I hate that it's not good enough anymore. : worldbuilding

I've learned a lot over the years, a lot of dos and don'ts, a lot of things about believable stories and true-to-life models and cliches and details and structures. I've learned rules and how to break them, and boy have I heard a lot about what people don't like.

I know more about the craft than I ever did, and I haven't been satisfied with anything I've put together in like a decade. I look back on the characters I used to write and the stories and worlds I came up with, drawing on note paper or filling sketchbooks with hand drawn comics, or writing mini-fiction in Word, and there's still a ton of stuff that I like there, but I would never give it a pass today.

I used to write characters with descriptions like "half-evil, half-robot". Is that coherent? Shit no! But it's more fun than, "This city has cliffs and the lizard people built some houses on them so they could fish from the ocean below them." Now my new characters are just accessories to my new setting. I spend all my time making sure the tourism industry in a frontier town feels plausible. I feel stupid if I imagine a bridge that's too long. And now I feel stupid for feeling stupid. But I'll do it again!

The thing is, I don't even really care about believable or consistent worlds, or characters with sensible motivations. I'm a Dragon Ball fan, man, I don't care about anything but a good time. I want comedy, and crazy stupid intense beautiful melodrama in an alien kingdom balancing on the edge of a cosmic knife. Or at least I did. I don't know what happened to me. Maybe endless internet videos and essays about media criticism and "tips for writers" happened.

Why do I find myself sitting here wondering whether the historical progression of this particular god's worship is believable compared to how actual religions change over time, when I used to just be like, "The god of order is a three-eyed six-armed black serpent with a jagged hawk beak and dragon wings, flippin' radical. His genies can be flying snakes. They hate the chaos genies, who are made of the most chaotic things known to man - slime and lightning."

I wish I could forget a lot of what I know. I want to go back to the old days. The thing is, I never *tried* to write wild and crazy stuff. I just drew cartoons and wrote around them, fulfilling whatever my interests were at any moment. Every stupid idea I ever had, *every one*, wound up a character in these stupid worlds, and it was fun, and I'd be embarrassed trying to explain it now.

I want to stop thinking so much. I want to stop measuring everything I come up with against everything I know about the process and standards and expectations of worldbuilding now. Why can't I go back to just bullshitting? What has become of me?

EDIT: The death of Akira Toriyama was just reported. I can't even come close to describing the full impact he had on my drawing and storytelling. What I can say is that the loss of a cartoonist idol has only sharpened this feeling that I'm drifting away from something special that I need to have back again. His work was the first thing that ever got me to really dream about what could be discovered in impossible worlds if we just explore. So many notebook pages filled, so many sketchbooks, so many planets and realms and times and people. So many unreal things realized just for the joy of making them. I am missing something. I can't quite name it, but maybe I need to relearn some old lessons to receive it again.
