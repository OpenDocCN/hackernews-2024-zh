# Announcing Anthropic’s Claude 3 models on Google Cloud Vertex AI | Google Cloud Blog

> 来源：[https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/ai-machine-learning/announcing-anthropics-claude-3-models-in-google-cloud-vertex-ai](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/ai-machine-learning/announcing-anthropics-claude-3-models-in-google-cloud-vertex-ai)

 At Google Cloud, we're committed to empowering customer choice and innovation through our curated collection of first-party, open-source, and third-party models available on Vertex AI. That’s why we're thrilled to announce that Claude 3 — [Anthropic’s new family of state-of-the-art models](https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-3-family) — will be generally available on [Vertex AI Model Garden](https://cloud.google.com/model-garden?hl=en) over the coming weeks, including private preview access for one of the models starting today.

Claude is Anthropic’s next-generation AI assistant that helps manage organizations’ tasks, no matter the scale. Anthropic’s launch of Claude 3 includes a family of three distinct models optimized for various enterprise applications:

*   **Claude 3 Opus:** Anthropic’s most capable and intelligent model yet.
*   **Claude 3 Sonnet:** Anthropic’s best combination of skills and speed.
*   **Claude 3 Haiku:** Anthropic’s fastest, most compact model.

Compared to earlier iterations of Claude, both Claude 3 Opus and Sonnet offer superior reasoning across complex tasks, content creation, scientific queries, math, and coding, while Haiku is Anthropic’s fastest and most cost-effective model. All Claude 3 models boast improved fluency in non-English languages, as well as vision capabilities that unlock tasks ranging from image metadata generation to insights extraction across PDFs, flow charts, and a diverse range of other formats.

In the weeks ahead, Google Cloud customers will be able to select from all three Claude 3 models via API access on [Vertex AI Model Garden](https://cloud.google.com/model-garden?hl=en). And starting today, customers [can apply for private preview access](https://console.cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/publishers/anthropic/model-garden/claude-3-sonnet) to Claude 3 Sonnet in Model Garden.

### Build and deploy with Claude 3 on Vertex AI

Through our partnership, we will bring Anthropic’s latest models to our customers via Vertex AI, the comprehensive AI development platform. The Claude 3 family joins over 130 models already available on Vertex AI Model Garden, further expanding customer choice and flexibility as gen AI use cases continue to rapidly evolve.

By making Claude 3 models available on Vertex AI, customers have powerful new options to:

*   **Accelerate AI development** with quick access to Claude's pre-trained models through simple API calls on Vertex AI.
*   **Focus on applications, not infrastructure** as Claude models are offered on Vertex AI as managed APIs — meaning customers can concentrate on building groundbreaking applications instead of worrying about backend complexity or the management overhead of underlying infrastructure.
*   **Optimize performance and costs** by leveraging flexible auto-scaling and pay-only-for-what-you-use pricing to optimize costs as needs grow. And of course, leverage world-class infrastructure, purpose-built for AI workloads.
*   **Deploy responsibly with Google Cloud’s built-in security, privacy, and compliance** as Vertex AI’s assortment of models and tools are offered with Google Cloud's enterprise-grade security, privacy, and compliance for generative AI.

### Sign up to access Claude 3 on Vertex AI
