In a new study published in the journal *[Humanities and Social Sciences Communications](https://doi.org/10.1057/s41599-024-02724-z)*, researchers investigated sexualized content on Twitch.tv, a livestreaming giant with a global daily viewership of 3 million. Their analysis of approximately 2,000 livestreams reveals a concerning trend: women are more frequently and intensely self-sexualizing than men, hinting at a broader pattern of ‘pornification’ in digital content to lure audiences.

Studies on traditional media (such as TV and movies) have extensively documented the sexualization of women and its consequences. However, the interactive and user-driven nature of new digital platforms like Twitch.tv presents new dynamics that warrant exploration, especially as they become integral to daily entertainment and social interaction.

Unlike traditional media, where portrayals of women are often controlled by external entities, platforms like Twitch.tv allow individuals to curate their own online personas. This autonomy raises questions about the factors driving self-sexualization, including societal pressures, the pursuit of popularity, and the platform’s economic incentives.

“This topic intrigued us due to the growing popularity of live streaming platforms like Twitch.tv and the public concern regarding the sexualized culture that may arise in these environments. We wanted to explore how this culture specifically manifests based on the gender of the streamers,” said study author [Kristel Anciones-Anguita](https://www.uah.es/es/estudios/profesor/Kristel-Anciones-Anguita/), a professor at the University of Alcalá and member of the Isabel Muñoz Caravaca Chair of Gender Studies and INTED Group.

“Our study aimed to shed light on the nature and extent of sexualized culture in deeply masculinized environments such as live streaming platforms. We examined how some streamers resort to the pornification of their content to attract audiences and the potential implications for the perception and behavior of users, especially teenagers who have yet to internalize their beliefs about sexuality.”

To begin, the researchers collected a sample of 1,920 video clips from Twitch.tv. These clips were selected based on their popularity within the most frequented categories of the platform. The sampling process was carried out from September to October 2022, focusing on the top videos within the videogame and “In Real Life” (IRL) categories, which were further broken down into subcategories like “JustChatting,” “ASMR,” and “Pools, Hot Tubs & Beaches.” This cross-sectional sampling aimed to capture the diversity of content and streaming practices on the platform.

The researchers excluded videos where the streamer’s image wasn’t shown and those featuring non-real images such as cartoons or 3D human representations. Each livestream was then evaluated based on a combination of factors such as clothing, exposed body parts, the focus of the image, posture, and behaviors that implied sexualization.

The results showed a clear gender disparity in self-sexualization. While the platform boasted a larger number of male streamers overall, female streamers were found to engage in self-sexualization to a much greater extent and intensity. Only two male streamers out of the entire sample were categorized as “hypersexual,” compared to 389 female streamers. Similarly, only 5 male streamers out of the entire sample were categorized as “sexual,” compared to 190 female streamers.

Female streamers were more likely to wear revealing clothing, focus the camera on their entire bodies, and exhibit behaviors or postures considered seductive or explicitly sexual. These findings underscore a notable difference in content presentation, with female streamers often leveraging their physical appearance and sexuality to attract viewership. In contrast, male streamers typically focused their streams on gaming prowess, conversations, or other non-sexualized content, seldom employing their physical appearance as a primary means of engagement.

“We were surprised by the significant difference in the levels of content sexualization based on the gender of the streamers,” Anciones-Anguita told PsyPost. “While men focus their content on talking or playing video games, it was found that the majority of streamers who used less clothing, simulated sexual acts, or displayed suggestive poses were women.”

The research also shed light on category-specific trends, revealing that self-sexualization was not uniformly distributed across Twitch.tv. Categories traditionally associated with gaming showed a lower prevalence of sexualized content among female streamers. In contrast, categories like ASMR and “Pools, Hot Tubs & Beaches” not only had a higher representation of women but also exhibited much higher levels of sexualization.

The study’s findings raise important concerns regarding the pressures and incentives that drive self-sexualization on digital platforms like Twitch.tv. These patterns of self-sexualization also have potential implications for the shaping of audience attitudes towards gender and sexuality.

“The intersection of self-objectification with issues such as sexual exploitation and human trafficking underscores the urgent need for platforms and policymakers to address these complex challenges,” Anciones-Anguita said. “Especially because, despite references to the concept of sexual freedom, self-sexualization often responds to a patriarchal idea created based on the male ideology.”

While this study sheds light on significant trends, it also has limitations, such as its focus on specific Twitch.tv categories. Future research could utilize a longitudinal design to examine trends over time, explore less popular streamers, or incorporate mixed methods to capture a fuller spectrum of the Twitch.tv experience and its impacts on both streamers and viewers.

“Our long-term goals for this line of research include deepening our understanding of how online sexualized culture affects adolescent girls and boys and how we can work to create more inclusive and healthy online communities,” Anciones-Anguita said.

“This study is just the beginning, and there is much more to explore in terms of the pornification of culture and its psychological impact on users. I hope that this work stimulates further research and conversations on this important topic.”
