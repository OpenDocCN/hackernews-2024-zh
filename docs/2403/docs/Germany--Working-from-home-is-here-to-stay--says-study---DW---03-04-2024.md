# Germany: Working from home is here to stay, says study – DW – 03/04/2024

German economic research institute Ifo says that [working from home](/en/remote-work/t-63715119) has now become embedded in the country's work culture — at least in some realms of employment.

Figures showed that the service sector, in particular, appears to have permanently shifted toward working from home since the coronavirus pandemic.

## What the research shows about German workers

Almost a quarter of workers in [Germany](/en/germany/t-17871182) — 24.1% — did their jobs, at least partially, from home in February.

The Munich-based research institute Ifo said that almost a quarter of employees in Germany worked at least partially from home in February 2024.

Ifo said the figures closely matched data in the years since the COVID-19 lockdown and did not appear to be changing. 

"The proportion has been almost constant for two years," said Ifo expert Jean-Victor Alipour. The concept of working from home has "been firmly established in Germany," he added.

## How the figures break down in different sectors

Working from home was noticeably less common in small and medium-sized companies, the data showed, with 20.5% of employees in such enterprises regularly working from home.

The proportion in large companies was 32.1% and was highest among service employees at 34.1 %. In industry, it was just 16%, in trade 12.2%, and in the construction industry 5.4%.

However, Ifo said, even where in-office presence is not strictly necessary, [it is sometimes desirable](/en/why-companies-want-workers-to-return-to-work/a-63194277).

"Stronger coordination of office hours to strengthen personal exchange definitely makes sense," Alipour said.

"It is undisputed that face-to-face work is superior to home office in some areas: for example in the transfer of knowledge, creativity in the group or social aspects."
