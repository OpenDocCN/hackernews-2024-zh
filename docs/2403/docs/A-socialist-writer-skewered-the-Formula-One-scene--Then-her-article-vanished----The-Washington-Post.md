# A socialist writer skewered the Formula One scene. Then her article vanished. - The Washington Post

Writer Kate Wagner may have seemed like an odd choice to cover the luxury world of Formula One.

A socialist who’s painfully self-conscious about class differences, Wagner skewers expensive homes on her blog McMansion Hell and writes about architecture for the left-wing magazine the Nation.

Formula One races, meanwhile, have become pit stops on the jet-set circuit, where the cheapest general-admission tickets start around $500\. Still, Road & Track magazine commissioned Wagner to cover a Formula One race in Austin last fall, sending her on a trip funded by British petrochemicals company INEOS.
