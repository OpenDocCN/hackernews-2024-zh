Federal prosecutors asking questions about Meta are "looking into whether the company’s social-media platforms are facilitating and profiting from the illegal sale of drugs," according to unnamed sources in a report today by the [*Wall Street Journal*](https://www.wsj.com/tech/u-s-is-investigating-meta-for-role-in-drug-sales-574944cb). Prosecutors reportedly sent Meta subpoenas last year seeking records on “violative drug content on Meta’s platforms and/or the illicit sale of drugs via Meta’s platforms.”

A Meta spokesperson told the *Journal* that, “The sale of illicit drugs is against our policies and we work to find and remove this content from our services. Meta proactively cooperates with law enforcement authorities to help combat the sale and distribution of illicit drugs.”

The *WSJ* said TikTok did not respond when asked whether it has received any subpoenas.

[Researchers who collected data](https://ati.io/) about prescription drug ads on Facebook for the *Journal* in 2022 also said they received a subpoena. Meta didn’t immediately respond to our request for comment.

As the *Journal* notes, Meta president of global affairs Nick Clegg [posted on Friday](https://x.com/nickclegg/status/1768663371820446029?s=20) that the company has joined the Alliance to Prevent Drug Harms. [US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken said](https://www.state.gov/secretary-antony-j-blinken-at-the-67th-session-of-the-un-commission-on-narcotic-drugs/) during a session of the UN Commission on Narcotic Drugs yesterday that the US and the UN Office on Drugs and Crime had begun “a new collaborative effort with Meta, Snap, and others to disrupt synthetic drug activity online.”
