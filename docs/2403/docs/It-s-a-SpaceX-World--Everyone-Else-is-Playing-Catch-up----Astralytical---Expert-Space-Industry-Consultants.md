# It’s a SpaceX World (Everyone Else is Playing Catch-up) — Astralytical | Expert Space Industry Consultants

SpaceX’s launch increase in 2023 is due to the company’s Starlink business. Of SpaceX’s 96 launches, two-thirds (63) deployed the company’s Starlink internet relay satellites. Put another way, 30% of the world’s launches and 70% of spacecraft were dedicated to one company’s space business, which catered to less than half a percent ([2.3 million](https://advanced-television.com/2023/12/22/starlink-over-2-3m-active-customers/)) of the world’s population ([8 billion](https://www.census.gov/library/stories/2023/11/world-population-estimated-eight-billion.html)) in 2023. 

SpaceX unsurprisingly leveraged its launch system for Starlink, but other companies have taken advantage of its low per-kilogram pricing, primarily through its Smallsat Rideshare Program. That’s where the smaller boxes representing other space operations companies and organizations in the spacecraft treemap become important. 

There are a lot of space operators. At least 130—more than half of nearly 230--(other than Starlink) relied on the remaining 33 SpaceX launches to deploy their spacecraft in 2023.

In comparison, about 130 space operators total deployed satellites in 2019\. During that year, SpaceX deployed satellites for 19 customers. The company also announced it would be offering its Smallsat Rideshare Program in 2019 and conducted its first launch under the program in 2021.

A sampling of companies and organizations demonstrates the diversity of SpaceX’s 130 launch customers. OneWeb (UK), IcEye (Finland), and GHGSAT (Canada) all deployed seven or more satellites using SpaceX in 2023.

Government organizations such as the United States Space Force (USSF), ESA, and the Norwegian Defence Research Establishment also launched satellites on SpaceX’s rockets in 2023\. Other U.S. launch companies don’t have the customer diversity of SpaceX.

Of Rocket Lab’s successful eight launches in 2023, only one was for a non-U.S. customer—iQPS (a space radar company from Japan). iQPS was one of seven Rocket Lab customers. With only one government customer in 2023 (NASA), most of the company’s customers were commercial space operators such as HawkEye360 and Capella Space.

However, Rocket Lab’s customer diversity is less in 2023 than in 2019, a possible casualty of SpaceX’s Rideshare program. For example, companies that used Rocket Lab’s service in 2019, such as Fossa and Unseenlabs, appear to have hopped over to SpaceX by 2023.

The remaining U.S. launch services didn’t launch enough to demonstrate their customer diversity. ULA not only had fewer launches than SpaceX or Rocket Lab for 2023—three—but its customer diversity is…not there. All three launches were for U.S. customers, two for military and one for commercial missions. Firefly Aerospace nearly equaled ULA’s 2023 launches with two successful (kind of) launches. Northrop Grumman managed to launch once to the ISS during the same year.

The stark contrast to SpaceX’s customer diversity in its launch business is the launch services of China and their lack of it in 2023\. While that nation’s launch services accounted for nearly 30% of the world’s launches in 2023, the 213 spacecraft those rockets deployed were over 7% of all spacecraft deployed. It’s nearly triple the 75 spacecraft deployed from China in 2019.

All but one of their 39 customers (up from 2019’s 29) were space operators from China. That one customer was the Egyptian Space Agency (three customers from other nations used China’s launch services in 2019). Those 39 made up 17% of launch customers across the globe despite the high number of launches from the nation’s launch services. 

Strangely, then, even though China’s launch services conducted many launches in 2023, its launch market and customer focus are generally disconnected from the rest of the world. That disconnect implies that even though China’s space industry is increasingly interesting and even groundbreaking, as well as gaining investments, it all seems irrelevant in the global marketplace. 

Part of China’s lack of customer diversity might be customer loss to SpaceX’s rideshare pricing and availability. But the lack might also be because no customer wants their service associated with launches in which [rocket bodies drop on the heads of China’s residents](https://www.space.com/chinese-rocket-booster-space-crash-report). Not all launches from China do that, but that’s terrible potential publicity that no company wants to be associated with.

The launch customers deployed by the launch services from other nations are more diverse than in China. Russia’s launch services catered to 19 customers. Three of those customers came from three different countries, such as Belarus. Despite launching just three times, France's Arianespace had nine launch customers. About six were from nations/organizations other than France. Launch services from India catered to eight customers, half from other nations. 

### Mass: My God…It’s Full of SpaceX

The mass a rocket can lift to orbit is its upmass capability. The more upmass available, the more flexibility a rocket offers to customers. A rocket with great upmass capability, such as the CZ-5B or Ariane 5, can launch satellites or crew and cargo capsules. They can transport space station segments to orbit or lift slightly smaller but useful payloads beyond the Moon. The less upmass capability a rocket has, such as the dedicated smallsat launchers, the less flexibility they have.
