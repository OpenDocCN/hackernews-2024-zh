The Wayland-based desktop is replacing X11 on more and more Linux distros. But like many applications, JDK is still X11-based. OpenJDK Project Wakefield is an effort to first support JDK running on Wayland in X11 compatibility mode, and followed up by the much larger effort to have a complete Wayland-native implementation. This session will discuss the goals, the technology, who and what is involved, and include live demos of progress to date.
