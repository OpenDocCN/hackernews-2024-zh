Earlier today, Emad Mostaque resigned from his role as CEO of Stability AI and from his position on the Board of Directors of the company to pursue decentralized AI.

The Board of Directors has appointed Shan Shan Wong, our Chief Operating Officer, and Christian Laforte, our Chief Technology Officer, as the interim co-CEOs of Stability AI. 

We are actively conducting a search for a permanent CEO to build upon Stability AI’s foundation and lead the company into its next phase of growth.

“On behalf of the Board of Directors, I want to thank Emad for his leadership and relentless commitment to Stability AI and the open source movement,” said Jim O’Shaughnessy, Chairman of the Board at Stability AI. “As we search for a permanent CEO, I have full confidence that Shan Shan Wong and Christian Laforte, in their roles as interim co-CEOs, will adeptly steer the company forward in developing and commercializing industry-leading generative AI products. Their complementary skill sets and experience ideally suit them for this role, giving us confidence in our future and in our ability to emerge from this period as a stronger company.”

“I am proud two years after bringing on our first developer to have led Stability to hundreds of millions of downloads and the best models across modalities. I believe strongly in Stability AI’s mission and feel the company is in capable hands. It is now time to ensure AI remains open and decentralised,” said Emad Mostaque.

This leadership change marks an opportunity for Stability AI, the management team, Board of Directors, and investors in a shared commitment to realize the full vision for the company’s next stage of growth. Together, we are committed to preserving the exceptional team, cutting-edge technology, and vibrant community that’s been cultivated over the years, ensuring Stability AI remains a leader in open multi-modal generative AI.
