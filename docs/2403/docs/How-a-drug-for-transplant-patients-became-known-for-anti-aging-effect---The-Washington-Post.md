To keep himself healthy into his eighth decade, David Sandler recently decided to go beyond his regular workouts and try something experimental: taking rapamycin, an unproven but increasingly popular drug to promote longevity.

The medication has gained a large following thanks to longevity researchers and celebrity doctors who, citing animal studies, contend that rapamycin could be a game changer in the quest tofend off age-related diseases. The drugis going mainstream as an anti-aging treatment, even though rapamycin’s [regulatory approval](https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2017/021083s059,021110s076lbl.pdf) is for treating transplant patients. There is no evidence that it can extend human life.
