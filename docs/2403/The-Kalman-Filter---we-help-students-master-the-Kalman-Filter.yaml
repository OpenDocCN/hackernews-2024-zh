- en: What is a covariance matrix? A covariance matrix is an essential part of the
    Kalman Filter output. If you have tried to learn about it by working through the
    expected value proof, you probably are still having a hard time understanding
    it. Why? Because the covariance matrix is best understood by visualizing it as
    an… [Continue reading Covariance Matrix Explained With Pictures](https://thekalmanfilter.com/covariance-matrix-explained/)

- en: What is the Extended Kalman Filter? The Extended Kalman Filter is a special
    Kalman Filter used when working with nonlinear systems. Since the Kalman Filter
    can not be applied to nonlinear systems, the Extended Kalman Filter was created
    to solve that problem. Specifically, it was used in the development of navigation
    control systems aboard Apollo… [Continue reading Extended Kalman Filter Python

- en: This post demonstrates how to implement a Kalman Filter in Python that estimates
    velocity from position measurements. If you do not understand how a Kalman Filter
    works, I recommend you read my Kalman Filter Explained Simply post. This example
    will use two Python libraries. I will use the NumPy Python library for arrays,
    matrices, and… [Continue reading Kalman Filter Python Example – Estimate Velocity

- en: Most tutorials for the Kalman Filter are difficult to understand because they
    require advanced math skills to understand how the Kalman Filter is derived. If
    you have tried to read Rudolf E Kalman’s 1960 Kalman Filter paper, you know how
    confusing this concept can be. But do you need to understand how to derive the…
