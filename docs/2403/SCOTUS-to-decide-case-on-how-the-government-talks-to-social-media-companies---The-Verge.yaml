    platforms for all sorts of reasons. For example, the Centers for Disease Control

    can flag potentially harmful posts to social media companies without it turning

    and Louisiana [decided to sue the Biden administration in May 2022](https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/63290154/1/missouri-v-biden/),
    arguing that various government arms — including the CDC and the Cybersecurity
    and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) — violated the First Amendment while
    communicating with social media companies. The AGs claimed that the Biden administration
    effectively coerced the platforms to take down posts or accounts spreading what
    was identified as covid or voting misinformation.

    the Biden administration can notify social media platforms about potentially concerning
    content on their sites. That could affect the safeguards these companies have
    put up around misinformation, and may change the kind of flags and warnings you
    see on posts all over the internet. SCOTUS is likely to issue a decision around
    June, just months ahead of the November elections.

    intimidation.'
  id: totrans-split-18

    the book distributors about how to comply with the law, but rather to intimidate
    them into suppressing and censoring content that the commission didn’t like,”
    according to Jennifer Jones, staff attorney at the Knight First Amendment Institute
    at Columbia University. The court recognized that while it’s constitutional for
    the authorities to advise or persuade intermediaries to act in a certain way,
    the government had gone too far in this instance. “When the acts become coercive,
    and when they basically apply this unrelenting pressure so that the intermediaries
    don’t publish speech because the government doesn’t like it, that does, in fact,
    violate the Constitution.”

    communicated with social media companies, Jones said, “that could really severely
    limit the ability of government officials to communicate with and work with the
    platforms moving forward.”

    at risk — communication is a two-way street, after all. Jones said that social

    to verify information (as they might be inclined to do during a public health
    emergency like the covid-19 pandemic, for example) for fear of being held liable

    “[E]ven if the Court views this case through the lens of state action, it should
    confirm that when the government interferes with private speech choices, the remedy
    lies in restraining the government — not in further abridging the rights of the
    coerced private parties with injunctions that limit the exercise of their own
    First Amendment rights,” the group wrote.
