- en: I’ve noticed in myself and other programmers that we believe ANY code we write
    is valuable. I’ve come to realise that this is completely false.

- en: I think this stems from programmers believing that writing code is like other
    forms of writing. With poetry, social media, and novels, you can produce anything,
    and there is potential for that writing to resonate with someone and create value.
    There’s actually this spectrum of value creation after reading something, from
    “meh it sucked” to “wow that was evocative in X way”. These forms of writing just
    don’t have an objective measure of value for the reader.

- en: But with coding that doesn’t apply. The objective measure of value is varying
    degrees of “was my problem solved”. If the problem wasn’t solved, the code is
    useless. The big mistake is believing that coding is entitled to the same spectrum
    of responses that we expect to see from readers.

- en: The really tough bit is that it’s hard to shake this belief given how much writing
    code feels like creative writing. Little components beautifully composed to make
    a product doesn’t seem too distant from writing a great story. The difficulty
    in learning to code also plays a role in this. Since it was hard to start and
    code anything, any code I do produce has met the threshold for value, right? Wrong.

- en: 'I’ve fallen into this trap so many times (w/ Grapevine, Venyu, etc). But now,
    I think I’m finally out. And there’s one key change I made to escape this cycle:
    I remind myself that I’m not an artist, and coding isn’t creative expression.
    There shouldn’t be some huge emotional investment in shipping SaaS, so I really
    needed to divorce myself from the end result. The app isn’t a representation of
    me, and it’s not a measure of how smart, dumb, or successful I am. It’s just an
    attempt at creating value. Once I internalised this, I stopped caring about clean
    code, perfection, and assuming my code is valuable to begin with. Now, if I start
    from the assumption that my code is not valuable, then I can only be pleasantly
    surprised when it is.'
