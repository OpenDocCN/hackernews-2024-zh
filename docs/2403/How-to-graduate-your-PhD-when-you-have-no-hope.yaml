    be honest I have no idea. What I did spend a lot of time thinking about, and have
    arrived at a somewhat self-convincing answer, is to a slightly different question
    - what makes a happy phd student?

- en: Richard Hamming’s inspiring and influential talk [You and Your Research](https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~robins/YouAndYourResearch.html)
    is what convinced me to do a phd. I wanted to work on important problems and aspired
    to contribute to the advancement of human knowledge. Oh, to be a scientist! 3
    years in I felt like there was no hope; I’ve toiled away all my time and the only
    way out is to quit.

    PhD graduate I know - Can I do as much as they did? What would a minimum effort
    phd look like? I answered that would result in a pretty bad thesis. And they said,
    that’s fine, bad is ok, go do what you can. [Anything worth doing is worth doing
    badly.](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/48132/failing-and-flying)

    Allow me to quote his letter in its entirety here - I thought it was the perfect
    antidote to Hamming-esque anxieties, the Dionysus to our Apollo. Enjoy, and hope
    you will finish your phd with peacefulness in your heart as well.

    Research Laboratories. Unfortunately your letter made me unhappy for you seem
    to be truly sad. It seems that the influence of your teacher has been to give
    you a false idea of what are worthwhile problems. **The worthwhile problems are
    the ones you can really solve or help solve, the ones you can really contribute
    something to. A problem is grand in science if it lies before us unsolved and
    we see some way for us to make some headway into it.** I would advise you to take
    even simpler, or as you say, humbler, problems until you find some you can really
    solve easily, no matter how trivial. You will get the pleasure of success, and
    of helping your fellow man, even if it is only to answer a question in the mind
    of a colleague less able than you. You must not take away from yourself these
    pleasures because you have some erroneous idea of what is worthwhile.

    problems close to the gods. But at the same time I had another Ph.D. Student (Albert
    Hibbs) was on how it is that the winds build up waves blowing over water in the
    sea. I accepted him as a student because he came to me with the problem he wanted
    to solve. With you I made a mistake, I gave you the problem instead of letting
    you find your own; and left you with a wrong idea of what is interesting or pleasant
    or important to work on (namely those problems you see you may do something about).
    I am sorry, excuse me. I hope by this letter to correct it a little.

    I enjoyed and felt very good about because I sometimes could partially succeed.
    For example, experiments on the coefficient of friction on highly polished surfaces,
    to try to learn something about how friction worked (failure). Or, how elastic
    properties of crystals depends on the forces between the atoms in them, or how
    to make electroplated metal stick to plastic objects (like radio knobs). Or, how
    neutrons diffuse out of Uranium. Or, the reflection of electromagnetic waves from
    films coating glass. The development of shock waves in explosions. The design
    of a neutron counter. Why some elements capture electrons from the L-orbits, but
    not the K-orbits. General theory of how to fold paper to make a certain type of
    child’s toy (called flexagons). The energy levels in the light nuclei. The theory
    of turbulence (I have spent several years on it without success). Plus all the
    “grander” problems of quantum theory.

    You will not long remain so to your immediate colleagues if you can answer their
    simple questions when they come into your office. You are not nameless to me.
    Do not remain nameless to yourself – it is too sad a way to be. now your place
    in the world and evaluate yourself fairly, not in terms of your naïve ideals of
    your own youth, nor in terms of what you erroneously imagine your teacher’s ideals
    are.
