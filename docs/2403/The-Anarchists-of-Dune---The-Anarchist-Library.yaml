    in a failed socialist colony called Burley, located along the Salish Sea near
    the city of Tacoma, Washington. It was dreary and cold during the fall and winter,
    and back in the day, before Herbert was born, all the excitement further down
    the sea in the anarchist Home Colony, a much more successful experiment in collective
    living. While the socialists of Burley struggled to replicate their small colony,
    Home grew bigger every year, even converting some of Burley’s socialists into
    anarchist defectors.

    lifestyle in the middle of nowhere, remote communities with no road access that
    were connected together by twice-a-day ferries, if that. Everyone had to chop
    wood, shovel animal shit, hammer nails, grow food, cook food, mill lumber, construct
    houses, erect piers, build bridges, and all the like. However, in the anarchist
    Home Colony, there was far more autonomy than in Burley, and teenage anarchists
    were building their own houses, using dynamite to blow up stumps, shoot rifles,
    pilot their own boats, and dancing late into the night by raging bonfires.

- en: When the young Frank Herbert was growing up, Home was known for many things,
    among them its Saturday night dances, the wildest and most popular around, and
    even when Herbert was himself a teenager, Home was where you went for a good time.
    Given the drabness of Burley and his own semi-Catholic upbringing, it’s hard to
    not see these dances as the infamous *spice orgy* of the Fremen, a moment when
    the rebels finally let down their rock-hard armor and feel good for a change,
    rather than being ruthless fighters committed to destroying the Empire.

    anarchist homesteader militants who smuggled dynamite, fomented uprisings in the
    coal fields of Vancouver Island, sheltered fugitives, shot at private detectives
    during strikes, and called for the death of capitalism. Beyond this, these anarchists
    were directly implicated in the 1910 bombing of the ultra-reactionary and anti-labor

    plates, anything metal, be it brass, iron, or copper. Just like the Fremen fabricate

- en: Frank Herbert’s grandfather Otto had been a socialist and follower of Eugene
    Debs, and he moved his family to Burley Colony in 1905, just as the community
    was falling apart. Given how close Burley was to Home, the Herbert family learned
    much about their anarchist neighbors, especially when several of them were arrested
    during a nude bathing scandal. The Herbert family was in Burley from 1905 to 1919,
    the year Home ceased to exist as an anarchist community, and they were nearby
    for all the major intrigue and conspiracy that took place there. Given young Frank
    Herbert’s love for his grandfather Otto and grandmother Mary, both socialists,
    it’s likely he cherished their stories from the old days and sought them out over
    stories from his father, who became a cop.

    although the young boy was already familiar with the region, having gone on many
    family trips. Like the anarchists of Home, young Frank woke up *in the frosty
    time before dawn, he milked the cow, collected eggs and fed the pigs*, just as
    his family *had a large vegetable garden, with corn, peas, beans, carrots, lettuce
    and other crops*. This was the type of self-sufficient, backwoods living Herbert

    creek, winding through a forest of cedar, alder and maple and falling across a
    sequence of rocky beaches.* This primordial landscape was shared by the anarchists

    and took it to school for lunch, along with fruits, vegetables and hard-boiled

    这个原始的风景被Home的无政府主义者分享，而年轻的弗兰克*也像他们一样，抽烟了他捕到的大部分鲑鱼，带到学校午餐，还有家庭农场的水果、蔬菜和硬煮鸡蛋。* 弗兰克·赫伯特甚至回忆道，*他们打猎鹿时，并没有什么运动。他们只是出去为家人拿肉。*

    was he known to canoe down there, his parents moved from Burley in 1931 and opened
    a dance hall on old Highway 99 near Seattle, a speakeasy that made a lot of money.
    Keep in my mind, Frank’s father was a former cop, and he quit to become a boot-legger,
    but he and Frank’s mother were pushed out of the dance-hall business by their
    partners, and by 1933, the family was broke and living near Tacoma to be near

- en: This allowed young Frank to return to Burley where he sought refuge in his canoe,
    and during one journey, he met a member of the Hoh tribe, known as *Indian Henry*,
    and these two became good friends. Similarly, the anarchists of Home had known
    an indigenous Squaxin who was called *Indian Jim*, and just like Frank, the anarchists
    would meet the natives as they paddled around in their boats and canoes, exchanging
    much local knowledge. All this to say, Frank Herbert was raised very much like
    the anarchists of Home, and while the socialist colony had fully collapsed by
    1920, there were still many anarchists who lived in Home in the 1930s, and Frank
    moved among them.

    in Tacoma, where he lived the big city life and left behind his rugged childhood.
    Without doubt, Frank knew of the anarchist rebels hidden out in the woods, having
    grown up hearing tales of explosions, guns, and arson, and if the Fremen are meant
    to represent anyone, its those hard-working, do-it-yourself, bomb-throwing anarchists
    of Home, and just like the Fremen, they had suffered years of defeat and repression
    at the hands of the US empire. With such an irresponsible cop father, Frank Herbert
    held an eternal soft-spot for those anarchists who lived just south of Burley,
    just as he encoded his own love for his grand-father’s old brand of socialism
    in his writing.

    last name Idaho, but back in the old days, Idaho was where the crazy bomb throwing
    miners lived, the ones who blasted apart their ex-governor in 1905\. It was a
    place where Eugene Debs had called a rebel army to invade Boise, a place where
    rebels had hijacked trains and gone mine to mine blowing up their shafts with
    dynamite. Before it was known as a racist, conservative hotbed, Idaho was where
    the hardest, fiercest rebels were known to reside, and young Frank probably learned
    of this Idaho from his socialist grandfather Otto. Fittingly, Duncan Idaho is

    of centralized power, but by spending nearly 1,000 pages to reaffirm one of anarchism’s
    oldest slogans: *no one is fit to rule, and no one deserves to be a slave.* Herbert’s
    natural sympathy was with the rebels, the underdogs, the Fremen, the anarchists
    of Home, and that’s why the upcoming cinematic rendering of the Empire’s defeat
    will be so gratifiying, as is being teased out in the official trailers. However,

    赫伯特的天性是同情叛军、弱势群体、弗雷门人、家园的无政府主义者，这就是为什么帝国的失败在即将上映的电影中会如此令人满意，正如官方预告片中所暗示的。然而，《沙丘》只是赫伯特最初警告的一半，或者说是他所谓的*预测行为*的一半，第二部分要黑暗得多。
