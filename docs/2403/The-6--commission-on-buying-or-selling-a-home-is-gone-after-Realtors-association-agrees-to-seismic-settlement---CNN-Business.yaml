- en: In a sweeping move expected to dramatically reduce the cost of buying and selling
    a home, the National Association of Realtors announced Friday a settlement with
    groups of homesellers, agreeing to end landmark antitrust lawsuits by paying $418
    million in damages and eliminating rules on commissions.

- en: The NAR, which represents more than 1 million Realtors, also agreed to put in
    place a set of new rules. One prohibits agents’ compensation from being included
    on listings placed on local centralized listing portals known as multiple listing
    services, which critics say led brokers to push more expensive properties on customers.
    Another ends requirements that brokers subscribe to multiple listing services
    — many of which are owned by NAR subsidiaries — where homes are given a wide viewing
    in a local market. Another new rule will require buyers’ brokers to enter into
    written agreements with their buyers.

    more than $25,000 in brokerage fees. Those costs are passed on to the buyer, boosting

    placing a listing on a multiple listing service. Although NAR has long said commissions
    are negotiable and that the structure helped making housing more affordable for
    buyers, critics have long argued that the fees were expected and homesellers felt
    they would lose buyers if they didn’t offer them.

- en: Homesellers who brought lawsuits against the NAR have argued that in a competitive
    market, the cost of the buyer’s agent’s commission should be paid by the buyer
    who received the service, not by the seller. The sellers who brought the lawsuit
    against the NAR and the brokerages said that buyers should be able to negotiate
    the fee with their agent, and that the sellers should not be on the hook for paying
    it.

    more competitive housing market. Realtors could now compete on commissions, allowing
    for prospective buyers to shop around on rates before they commit to buying a
    home. Brokers could begin to advertise their fees, allowing customers to choose
    lower-cost agents. The NAR, in its announcement, did not set a suggested fee.
