- en: There are a lot of things I want to do. I want to create and build and make
    and write.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And then, of course, there are other things that I just have to do, like bookkeeping
    and responding to emails.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Sometimes, it all gets to be too much. There are too many things to do! I need
    to figure out where to start! I get paralyzed by the sheer enormity of it all.

- en: It doesn't matter what! Write half of an article. Categorize two expenses. Write
    down all your ideas for videos. Clean your office. Respond to a single email.

- en: By doing anything, I find momentum. I find motivation! I ease the heavy feeling
    and find my stride. The mere act of doing pushes back the tidal wave of thoughts.

  prefs: []

- en: The solution is primarily emotional too! Just do one thing.

- en: By doing one thing, I feel like maybe things are doable after all. And if things
    are doable, then maybe I can do more things!

    be done and thought: "everything is impossible. Nothing can ever be finished.
    There''s no way that anything in the universe has ever been done."'

    not me.

    issue: underwhelm. Aimlessness!'

    want to do.

    to be," or "I don''t have any ideas for videos," or "I don''t know what projects

- en: Know that it's okay to change course once you've started. It's okay to start
    something and then realize something might be better for you. That's the beauty
    of action; it opens paths you wouldn't have seen earlier.

- en: You'll rarely discover "what's next" by standing still. Start working on *something*.
    Start tinkering. That will put you in motion to figure out what "the thing" is.
