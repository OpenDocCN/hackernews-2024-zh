- en: The world desperately needs new ways to tackle our climate crisis. But coming
    up with innovative solutions, let alone scaling them, is difficult, time-consuming,
    and expensive—plenty of startups fail before they can reach critical mass. Prizes
    can often play a crucial role in driving positive change, rewarding individuals
    and companies with both the funding and the increased recognition needed to make
    real progress.

    comes in. Since 2008, the prize—established as a tribute to the sustainability
    and humanitarian efforts of the UAE’s founding father, the late Sheikh Zayed bin
    Sultan Al Nahyan—has been celebrating sustainability pioneers, from high schools
    to SMEs to nonprofits. In total, over 378 million people across 151 countries,
    and counting, are now benefiting from the solutions developed by its 106 winners.

    winner S4S Technologies, for instance, uses solar conduction dryers to help farmers
    convert otherwise lost food into preservative-free, nutrient-rich ingredients,
    boosting farm profits in the Global South by up to 200 per cent. Winning the Prize
    not only provided critical funding, but brought international recognition that helped
    S4S reach thousands more farmers and female micro-entrepreneurs. In total, the
    company is thought to have prevented 36,000 tons of food waste and supplied nutrition
    to 1.2 million people.
