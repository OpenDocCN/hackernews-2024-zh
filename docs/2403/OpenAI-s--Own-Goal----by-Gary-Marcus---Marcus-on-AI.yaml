- en: Elon Musk’s lawsuit against OpenAI may fail, or even get dismissed. But it’s
    already brought some important facts to light. OpenAI was so upset about the optics
    that [they rushed out a statement](https://openai.com/blog/openai-elon-musk),
    proclaiming ‘We are dedicated to the OpenAI mission and have pursued it every
    step of the way.”

- en: 'That statement is dubious. The original mission, according to public statement
    and legal filings, was to be “unconstrained by a need to generate a financial
    return”, “not organized for … private gain”, “seek[ing] to open source technology
    where applicable.” Their opening statement to the world, December 15, 2015 was
    a statement of selfless beauty; had they stuck to it, I might still be in their
    fan club:'

    least open AI companies anywhere. They are not freely collaborating, they are
    not publishing the details of their work. Almost nothing is known about the precise
    internal mechanisms of GPT-4 or what it has trained on. Rather than sharing with
    everyone, they are mostly sharing with Microsoft, which has an exclusive right
    to some aspects of the software and models. And 49% of OpenAI’s first couple hundred
    billion dollars in profits goes to them. Rather than helping all humanity OpenAI
    is (I would argue) effectively stealing intellectual property from artists, writers,
    etc to increase their profits.

    in their counterattack. In dealing with the above-mentioned inconvenient truths,
    OpenAI’s preferred narrative historically has been essentially to say (in my paraphrase)
    “we always intended to open source stuff but eventually, when GPT-2 came out in
    2019, decided that it might be too dangerous to release”. (Never mind that they
    now sell a far more capable model at competitive prices.)

    Sutskever to Musk, just three weeks after the beautiful initial mission statement.
  id: totrans-split-14

- en: Their point, which they were eager to make yesterday, is that they advised Musk
    that they wouldn’t be following the open-source mission, and that Musk acknowledged
    the above email. This may help them in court (though he had already publicly committed
    himself and might claim he was under duress).

    it shows decisively that OpenAI knew for *years* that they had no intention of
    being as open as their name or public statements suggested.

    equity.
