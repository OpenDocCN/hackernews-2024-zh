- en: Apple's iOS 17.4 software update was released earlier this week and among other
    things, it enabled support for third-party app stores in EU member countries.
    Dubbed "alternative app marketplaces" by Apple, access to these third-party app
    stores is mandated by the new Digital Markets Act in the European Union, but no
    such requirement exists outside of the bloc. As a result of that, Apple took the
    decision to only enable alternative app marketplaces in the EU, leaving those
    elsewhere to use the [App Store](https://www.imore.com/how-download-apps-and-games-your-iphone-and-ipad).
    But it isn't quite that simple.

- en: As part of Apple's enabling of support for such marketplaces, it requires that
    users have an EU Apple ID while the iPhone has to physically be in an EU country
    as well. That's to ensure that people in other parts of the world can't gain access
    to third-party app stores by pretending to be in the EU, and it's a stance that
    isn't wholly surprising. However, the requirement for an EU GPS fix does potentially
    raise issues — like when people go on vacation.

- en: Apple had previously said that it would give EU citizens a period of graze for
    which third-party app stores would continue to work even when they left the EU,
    but it hadn't clarified how long that period would be. That has today changed,
    with some clarification offered in an updated [support document](https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=23432X820453&xcust=im_us_1561366818289953883&xs=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fsupport.apple.com%2Fen-us%2F118110&sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.imore.com%2Fiphone%2Fapple-confirms-iphone-owners-can-travel-outside-the-eu-for-30-days-before-they-lose-access-to-third-party-app-stores)
    that details exactly how things will go down.

- en: The updated document confirms that in order for alternative app marketplaces
    to be available "the country or region of your Apple ID must be set to one of
    the countries or regions of the European Union, and you must physically be located
    in the European Union." Apple notes that "device eligibility for alternative app
    marketplaces is determined using on-device processing with only an indicator of
    eligibility sent to Apple," adding that "to preserve your privacy, Apple does
    not collect your device's location."

- en: '"If you leave the European Union, you can continue to open and use apps that
    you previously installed from alternative app marketplaces," Apple begins. "Alternative
    app marketplaces can continue updating those apps for up to 30 days after you
    leave the European Union, and you can continue using alternative app marketplaces
    to manage previously installed apps."'

- en: That all seems unlikely to cause too many issues, but there's a caveat. "However,
    you must be in the European Union to install alternative app marketplaces and
    new apps from alternative app marketplaces," Apple warns. That appears to suggest
    that as soon as an EU citizen leaves the EU, they won't be able to install anything
    outside of the App Store. Whether or not that will be something the European Commission
    takes issue with, remains to be seen. After all, an EU citizen is an EU citizen
    even *after* they leave the EU.

    in the way it has chosen to comply with it. These limitations may be another example
    of that, but it will be left to the European Commission to decide on that. The
    EC has already demanded Apple explain why it has [chosen to ban Epic Games' developer
    account](https://www.imore.com/apple/eu-demands-answers-over-apples-latest-epic-games-twist-bloc-seeks-explanation-after-cupertino-terminates-fortnite-makers-developer-account)
    and it seems more butting of heads could follow, too.
