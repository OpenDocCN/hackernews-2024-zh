    images that have been overly edited or manipulated. Reuters, for example, says
    it only allows the use of Photoshop in “very limited” ways such as cropping or
    resizing images, or balancing their color.

    it undermines trust in both the image and a news organization’s credibility even
    if they are not the source of the changes.

    headache for Britain’s royal family at a time when it was trying to tamp down

    return to public duties until Easter](https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/17/uk/princess-of-wales-kate-abdominal-surgery-gbr-intl/index.html)
