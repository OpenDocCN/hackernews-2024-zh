    Computer Scientists and disparage their work. Quite frankly, I find the results
    embarrassing -- instead of cutting the opponent down, many of the remarks have
    been laughably innocuous. Something must be done about it because any outsider
    who hears such blather will think less of our department: no group can hold the
    respect of others unless its members can deal a devastating verbal blow at will.'

    and help avoid wimpy vindictives. It explains how to insult CS research, shows
    where to find the Achilles' heel in any project, and illustrates how one can attack
    a researcher.

    on the overall aims of CS research. They do not. In particular, CS has inherited
    two, quite opposite approaches from roots in mathematics and engineering.

    someone. There are two basic rules: identify the type of the researcher and issue
    an insult for that type. Avoid saying anything that inadvertently compliments
    them. If performed well, an insult will not only stun the researcher (who will
    be shocked to learn that not everyone agrees with his or her basic value system),
    but will also intimidate others in the audience.'
