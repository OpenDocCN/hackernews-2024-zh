    that is abundant in our genome but had been dismissed for decades as junk DNA,
    a sequence that seemingly serves no biological purpose. They identified the snippet,
    known as an Alu element, in the regulatory code of a gene associated with tail

    only in hominoid genomes, the scientists reported February 28 in the journal [Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07095-8).

    the absence of a tail is the most visible result of the Alu insertion, it’s possible
