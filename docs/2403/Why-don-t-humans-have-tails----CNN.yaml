- en: Tails are useful for balance, propulsion, communication and defense against
    biting insects. However, humans and our closest primate relatives — the great
    apes — said farewell to tails about 25 million years ago, when the group split
    from Old World monkeys. The loss has long been associated with our transition
    to bipedalism, but little was known about the genetic factors that triggered primate
    taillessness.

- en: Now, scientists have traced our tail loss to a short sequence of genetic code
    that is abundant in our genome but had been dismissed for decades as junk DNA,
    a sequence that seemingly serves no biological purpose. They identified the snippet,
    known as an Alu element, in the regulatory code of a gene associated with tail
    length called TBXT. Alu is also part of a class known as jumping genes, which
    are genetic sequences capable of switching their location in the genome and triggering
    or undoing mutations.

    gene in the ancestor of hominoids (great apes and humans). When scientists compared
    the DNA of six hominoid species and 15 non-hominoid primates, they found AluY
    only in hominoid genomes, the scientists reported February 28 in the journal [Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07095-8).
    And in experiments with genetically modified mice — a process that took roughly
    four years — tinkering with Alu insertions in the rodents’ TBXT genes resulted
    in variable tail lengths.

    to be tailless,” the most common of which connected taillessness to upright posture
    and the evolution of bipedal walking, said lead study author [Bo Xia](https://scholar.harvard.edu/boxia/home),
    a research fellow in the Gene Regulation Observatory and principal investigator
    at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard University.

    region of the genome in an online database that’s widely used by developmental
    biologists, said study coauthor [Itai Yanai](https://med.nyu.edu/faculty/itai-yanai),

    Pharmacology at the New York University Grossman School of Medicine.

    one out of a million that we have in our genome,” Yanai said. But while most researchers
    had dismissed TBXT’s Alu insertion as junk DNA, Xia noticed its proximity to a
    neighboring Alu element. He suspected that if they paired up, it could trigger
    a process disrupting protein production in the TBXT gene.

    to breed mice with the Alu insertion in their TBXT genes. They found that Alu
    made the TBXT gene produce two kinds of proteins. One of those led to shorter
    tails; the more of that protein the genes produced, the shorter the tails.

    think about how they’re also shaping very important aspects of physiology, of
    morphology, of development,” he said. “I think it’s astounding that one Alu element
    — one small, little thing — can lead to the loss of a whole appendage like the
    tail.”

    appendage is a hand-me-down from the tailed ancestor of all vertebrates and includes
    10 to 12 vertebrae. It’s only visible from the fifth to sixth week of gestation,
    and by the fetus’ eighth week its tail is usually gone. Some babies retain an
    embryonic remnant of a tail, but this is extremely rare and such tails typically
    lack bone and cartilage and are not part of the spinal cord, another team of researchers
    [reported](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3263034/#:~:text=A%20%E2%80%9Cvestigial%20tail%E2%80%9D%20describes%20a,weeks%2C%20the%20human%20tail%20disappears)

    apes, the “why” of it is still an open question, said biological anthropologist

    of anthropology at the University of Texas at Austin.

    have been responsible for loss of the tail in hominoids, and this paper makes a
    valuable contribution that way,” Shapiro, who was not involved in the research,
    told CNN in an email.

    it still begs the question as to whether or not the mutation was maintained because
    it was functionally beneficial (an evolutionary adaptation), or just not a hindrance,”
    said Shapiro, who investigates how primates move and the role of the spine in
    primate locomotion.

    their tails. The oldest members of the hominid lineage are the early apes Proconsul
    and Ekembo (found in Kenya and dating to 21 million years ago and 18 million years
    ago, respectively). Fossils show that though these ancient primates were tailless,
    they were tree-dwellers that walked on four limbs with a horizontal body posture
    like monkeys, Shapiro said.

    apes evolved subsequently,” Shapiro said. “But it does not help us understand
    why the tail was lost in the first place.”

    tail muscles being repurposed as pelvic floor muscles, “is an old idea that is

    is far from over, and there is still much about tail loss for scientists to explore,
    Xia said.

- en: Future research could investigate other consequences of the Alu element in TBXT,
    such as impacts on human embryonic development and behavior, he suggested. Though
    the absence of a tail is the most visible result of the Alu insertion, it’s possible
    that the gene’s presence also triggered other developmental shifts — as well as
    changes to locomotion and related behaviors in early hominoids — to accommodate
    tail loss.
  id: totrans-split-34

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Additional genes probably played a part in tail loss, too. While Alu’s role
    “seems to be a very important one,” other genetic factors likely contributed to
    the permanent disappearance of our primate ancestors’ tails,” Xia said.

    related to stabilizing the loss of the tail,” Yanai said. And because such evolutionary
    change is complex, our tails are gone for good, he added. Even if the driving
    mutation identified in the study could be undone, “it still wouldn’t bring back
    the tail.”

    known as spina bifida. In their experiments, the researchers found that when mice
    were genetically engineered for tail loss, some developed neural tube deformities
    that resembled spina bifida in humans.

    that our ancestors made 25 million years ago to lose their tails,” Yanai said.
    “Now that we made this connection to this particular genetic element and this
    particularly important gene, it could open up doors in studying neurological defects.”
