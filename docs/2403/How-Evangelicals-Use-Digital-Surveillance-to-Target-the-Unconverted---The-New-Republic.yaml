- en: One video obtained by *The New Republic *from missionary monitoring organization
    Beyneynurates Houston suburbs with large Muslim populations as “shooting fish
    in a barrel” when it comes to evangelism. Kevin Greeson, [Texas hub leader of
    Global Gates](https://globalgates.info/global-gates-houston-2/), a large missionary
    network and enthusiastic customer of Bless Every Home, explains the ways the app
    can be used. In one instance, he points to the sharable note-taking function and
    suggests leaving information for each household, such as “Daughter left for college”
    and “Mother is in the hospital.”

    app during the training video, Greeson concedes that “this thing is so powerful—it’s
    an invasion of privacy.” He claims that there are 50 different sources of information
    that are used to provide the comprehensive dataset, which is all “public information.”
    This is a bit of a dodge: Much of the data that Greeson is talking about harvesting
    in this fashion is commercial information not generally available to the public.
    Moreover, the way he intends it to be used, which in this case would lead to missionaries
    essentially publishing online lists of information about targeted ethnic groups
    in specific locations, could conceivably be dangerous in the wrong hands.'

- en: Contacted by *The New Republic* about privacy and data security concerns, Greeson,
    who emphasized that Global Gates is a paying customer of the app and not responsible
    for its content, said that “data remains within the confidentiality of each Global
    Gates missionary.” Sharing with partnering churches, he added, means that “only
    … one or two people in the church” have access to it. Greeson added that Global
    Gates only uses the lists of houses with children for Vacation Bible School invitations,
    saying, “We always strive to protect privacy and especially the safety of children.”
    A privacy statement on the Bless Every Home website says that it does not “knowingly
    collect personal information from children under 13.” (Representatives for Bless
    Every Home did not respond to requests for comment.)
