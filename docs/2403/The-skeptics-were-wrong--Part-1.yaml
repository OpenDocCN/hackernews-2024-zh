    coming out of FIRE’s new [Campus Deplatforming Database](https://www.thefire.org/research-learn/campus-deplatforming-database)

    free speech really are. This week, we’ll address the skepticism about the “campus

    for Heterodox Academy, Sean and Jonathan Haidt proposed that a “new dynamic” was
    emerging on American college campuses and that current college students were more
    hostile toward freedom of speech than their older counterparts. Sean and Haidt
    proposed that this “new dynamic” represented a set of “politically correct” viewpoints
    that made it harder for students and faculty who dissented from these viewpoints
    to express themselves.

    on an analysis of FIRE’s Campus Disinvitation Database (now the [Campus Deplatforming
    Database](https://www.thefire.org/research-learn/campus-deplatforming-database))
    as well as data from five different surveys. The data demonstrated that in 2016
    and 2017, student participation in disinvitation attempts and substantial event
    disruptions was at record levels and was increasingly targeting conservative expression.
    It also showed that college students thought their campuses were stifling the
    expression of controversial ideas (which on many campuses, were likely to be conservative,
    or, at least, *deemed* to be conservative, what Greg calls “[fasco-casting](https://youtu.be/r-jkyLYNSCY?feature=shared)”).

    in Gaza since the start of the Israel-Hamas war and began shouting Hammer down.
