    who meet and establish a rapport with participants before the drug is administered.

    to alleviate anxiety associated with life-threatening conditions, this groundbreaking

    anxiety without the adjunct of psychotherapy,” said psychiatrist Dr. Gabriella
    Gobbi, a professor and scientist at McGill University Health Centre in Montreal
    and Canada Research Chair in Therapeutics for Mental Health. She was not involved
