    are highly refined breads, fast food, sugary drinks, cereals, cookies, and other
    packaged snacks. They are often high in salt, sugar, fat and calories and low

    of ultra-processed foods can cause anxiety, cancer or other health conditions.
    These studies point to associations, not causation. But at a time when diet is
    a [leading cause of chronic disease](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9921002/#:~:text=Diet%2C%20often%20considered%20as%20a,and%20perhaps%20some%20neurological%20diseases.),

    the risk is not clear, though the overlap with metabolic disease is striking.

    and metabolic syndrome factors, "that are closely tied to colorectal cancer,"

    amounts, under a certain threshold, are not at increased risk. Though it is not
    clear exactly how much is OK, because it may vary from person to person and depend
    on other lifestyle habits. However, the research shows people who consume the
    most are more likely to be affected by mood and mental health struggles.
