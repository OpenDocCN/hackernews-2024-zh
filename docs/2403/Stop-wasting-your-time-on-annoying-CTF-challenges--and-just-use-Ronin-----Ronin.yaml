- en: The other day I spotted someone in [nahamsec](https://nahamsec.com/)’s Discord
    server struggling with a CTF challenge that involved decoding an encrypted string.
    They had already tried [CyberChef](https://cyberchef.org/), but no luck. Other
    users encouraged them to “try harder”.

    binary data. The user said that the challenge hinted that the string was XOR encrypted
    and the plain-text was of the form `CNS{md5hash}`.

- en: Starting with the assumption that the CTF challenge probably used an XOR encryption
    key of a single ASCII character, all we have to do is bruteforce decrypt the base64
    decoded string using every possible character in the ASCII character set, then
    find the decrypted string that starts with `CNS{`.
