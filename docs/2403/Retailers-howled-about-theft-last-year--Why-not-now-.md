# Retailers howled about theft last year. Why not now?

> 来源：[https://text.npr.org/1236075589](https://text.npr.org/1236075589)

For much of the past year or so, executives at big retailers did something unusual: They talked about theft in their stores. A lot.

Walmart's CEO warned it could [lead to store closures](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/12/06/walmart-ceo-says-shoplifting-could-lead-to-price-jumps-store-closures.html) and higher prices. Target's CEO said it was costing the chain [upward of a billion dollars](https://corporate.target.com/getmedia/a32499c2-0f20-4d33-9d6b-2265cf7fd95d/2023-05-17-Q1-Transcript-TGT.pdf). Home Depot's finance chief called it a "[consistent pressure](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2023/08/15/home-depot-hd-q2-2023-earnings-call-transcript/)" that the chain is "tackling every day."

With a [backdrop of viral videos](/2023/10/09/1203697964/flash-mob-retail-thefts) showing brazen and [violent](https://abcnews.go.com/US/home-depot-employee-fatally-shot-confronting-alleged-shoplifter/story?id=98703891) thieves, crime became a common theme on retailers' typically dry quarterly earnings calls. Executives often mentioned "shrink" — inventory missing for one reason or another — as a factor behind declining profits. The list grew long: Macy's, Best Buy, Dick's Sporting Goods, T.J.Maxx, Dollar General.

Fast-forward to this year, and the fever pitch seems to be fading.

So far this earnings season: Walgreens said the problem remains — and is really bad in some places. But Foot Locker described changes in shrink as "[relatively neutral](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4676380-foot-locker-inc-fl-q4-2023-earnings-call-transcript)." T.J.Maxx's parent company found it [better than expected](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4674396-tjx-companies-inc-tjx-q4-2024-earnings-call-transcript). Target cited "[really solid progress](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2024/03/05/target-tgt-q4-2023-earnings-call-transcript/)." Many didn't mention shrink at all. Two retailers hurt by theft in the past — Ulta and Dick's Sporting Goods — will address investors on Thursday.

What has changed?

Retailers cite a few things: Federal and state lawmakers have [drafted new crime bills](https://www.sacbee.com/news/politics-government/capitol-alert/article286391150.html), and [some have become law](https://apnews.com/article/retail-theft-virginia-law-repeal-d0bd556e030996ada00fcb1bbe40145c). Many stores have scaled back self-checkout options and locked away more products behind glass doors; their security investments are starting to bear fruit.

But one thing remains the same: Crime data has yet to indicate a nationwide epidemic of theft, leaving us only to guess at the true scale of the problem — then and now.

### How big of a problem is retail theft?

Most retailers say their top worry is "organized retail crime" — coordinated operations in which people tend to steal and offload in bulk, often through online stores. Security experts argue that criminal rings proliferated as the COVID-19 pandemic ebbed, in part thanks to understaffed stores and soaring online demand.

But companies do not share data on goods stolen, let alone stolen in a specific manner. And individual stores often [don't report incidents to the police](/2023/11/29/1215568143/its-peak-shopping-and-shoplifting-season-cops-are-stepping-up-antitheft-tactics).

Instead, the most commonly cited figure comes from an annual National Retail Federation survey that asks retailers to assess "shrink," a much broader measure. Overall, [the latest survey](https://nrf.com/research/national-retail-security-survey-2023) attributes about 36% of shrink to shoplifting and organized theft, 29% to theft by employees and 27% to mistakes in tracking, accounting or other errors.

The survey makes eye-popping estimates: Retailers lost $112 billion to shrink in 2022, the most recent figure. Using the given breakdown, this could mean stores lost over $40 billion that year to outside theft.

But the picture is not that clear. For one thing, the dollar value of shrink is calculated based on a percentage of retailers' sales, and in 2022 shoppers went on a [record buying spree](/2022/11/25/1139231005/black-friday-shoppers-are-expected-to-spend-more-money-due-to-inflation).

The survey shows the scale of shrink has barely changed in the past decade. In 2022, retailers on average said shrink affected 1.6% of sales — the same as in 2020 and 2019\. In other years, the average hovered around 1.4%, which [at one point was reported](https://wwd.com/feature/nrf-inventory-retailers-2014-survey-10165709/) as the lowest rate in two decades.

When the next survey is released in the coming months, it may show shrink was a substantially bigger problem last year, at around 2% of sales, according to a report by the investment bank William Blair.

Still, the analysts surmised that retailers also likely used crime as a cover for closures of underperforming locations and lackluster financial results, making up for shoppers' tightening budgets, for example, or a glut of unpopular products.

"While theft is likely elevated," the report said, "companies are also likely using the opportunity to draw attention away from margin headwinds," meaning other factors that eroded their profits, such as deeper discounts or poor management of inventory.

### What happened at Walgreens and Target

Walgreens and Target illustrate how opaque and complicated the question of theft can be.

In late 2021, Walgreens shut down five stores in San Francisco, citing skyrocketing organized retail crime. One of the stores appeared in a [viral video](https://twitter.com/LyanneMelendez/status/1404574079156318210?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1404574079156318210%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fsfist.com%2F2021%2F06%2F21%2Fthief-filmed-shoplifting-at-san-francisco-walgreens-in-viral-video-arrested-after-attempting-to-steal-again%2F) of a thief loading up a trash bag while being filmed by several people, including a security guard. Later, a *San Francisco Chronicle* [data analysis found](https://www.sfchronicle.com/sf/article/Is-shoplifting-forcing-Walgreens-to-cut-back-in-16536960.php) that one of the closing stores had reported only seven shoplifting incidents that year, fewer than in 2018.

Then, in January 2023, Walgreens' finance chief shocked the industry by saying "[maybe we cried too much last year](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2023/01/05/walgreens-boots-alliance-wba-q1-2023-earnings-call/)" over thefts. He said shrink had declined. The chain would scale back anti-theft spending and rely more on law enforcement than "largely ineffective" security companies.

Now the company's leadership has changed. New finance chief Manmohan Mahajan [told investors in January](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2024/01/16/walgreens-boots-alliance-wba-q1-2024-earnings-call/) that shrink "continues to be a systemic issue" for retailers. Later, new CEO Tim Wentworth said he didn't expect things to improve in 2024.

"Let me be clear. It is very real — it is an industry problem," Wentworth said at an [industry conference](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4661739-walgreens-boots-alliance-inc-wba-j-p-morgan-42nd-annual-healthcare-conference-transcript). "The urban area in particular in some cities is challenged, some more than others. We believe that it's something that is going to take some time."

Target took center stage on retail crime after November 2022, when executives got specific: They said shrink could cost the chain $600 million over the year.

They kept focusing onit. In May 2023, they said shrink would reduce Target's annual profits [by over $500 million](https://corporate.target.com/getmedia/a32499c2-0f20-4d33-9d6b-2265cf7fd95d/2023-05-17-Q1-Transcript-TGT.pdf) from a year earlier. In August, CEO Brian Cornell [said violent thefts](https://corporate.target.com/getmedia/d2af905f-82f7-4602-ba27-053e6cf50c1a/2023-08-16-Q2-Transcript-TGT.pdf) at stores increased 120% in the first five months of 2023, compared with the same period in 2022.

In September, Target [announced it was closing nine locations](https://corporate.target.com/press/statement/2023/09/target-closes-select-stores-to-prioritize-team-member-and-guest-safety) in New York City, Seattle, the San Francisco Bay Area and Portland, Ore., because of theft and organized retail crime. Later, [data analysis by CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/12/19/target-store-closures-theft-and-crime-higher-nearby.html) showed that as Target closed those stores, it chose to keep operating nearby locations that had reported more crime incidents but that also served more and wealthier shoppers.

Target described numerous anti-theft investments, including locked merchandise, de-escalation training and more security staff. The chain was also delivering disappointing financial reports: Inflation had shoppers prioritizing necessities, and Target took a big hit. Sales [barely grew in 2022](https://corporate.target.com/press/release/2023/02/target-corporation-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full) and [declined in 2023](https://corporate.target.com/press/release/2024/03/target-corporation-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2023-earnings) for the first time in years.

### **Safety measures turn off shoppers**

Of course, big-picture statistics can mask trouble in specific places.

Shoplifting, for example, rose between 2019 and 2023 in New York City, Los Angeles, Virginia Beach and Dallas, while declining in over a dozen other cities, according to a [November report](https://counciloncj.org/shoplifting-trends-what-you-need-to-know/) by the Council on Criminal Justice, a nonpartisan think tank.

And shoppers often encounter a clear sign of stepped-up security: products like makeup, baby formula andlaundry detergent locked behind plexiglass or even replaced with photographs. Katherine Black at the consulting firm Kearney said stores would not choose this if they didn't have to.

"To combat this problem, inherently, they're putting in place measures that detract sales," Black explained.

Almost a third of shoppers say locked-up products hurt their perception of a store, according to Kearney's October survey of 500 adults in the U.S. and Canada. More than a quarter say this prompts them to abandon the purchase and 46% say they end up buying somewhere else.

No major retailer has disclosed sales lost over heightened security so far. During Target's latest earnings call, one analyst asked executives about this, but they did not respond directly.

"When I think about shrink, I'll start with the word 'progress,'" Cornell said. "I think we're seeing really solid progress and greater awareness at the national, state and local level."

Retailers have long lobbied for [tougher prosecution of shoplifters](/2020/10/16/923844907/when-shoplifting-is-a-felony-retailers-back-harsher-penalties-for-store-theft) and a crackdown on online platforms used by resellers, including Amazon and Facebook Marketplace.

Over the past year, [several states](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/08/11/organized-retail-crime-nine-states-pass-laws-to-crack-down-on-theft.html) have gone after organized retail crime with new laws. Leaders in [California](https://laist.com/news/criminal-justice/la-county-is-getting-a-funding-boost-to-fight-smash-grab-theft), New York and other places have put funding priority on "smash-and-grab" crimes. Congress [passed a law](https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=granuleid:USC-prelim-title15-section45f&num=0&edition=prelim) requiring online marketplaces to verify the identities of high-volume sellers.

Retailers also claim their security investments are starting to show results.

This can include tracking alarms or moving high-risk products closer to registers. Many stores began restricting the use of self-checkout, including [Walmart](https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/shopping/2024/03/06/walmart-self-checkout-update/72866539007/) and [Target](https://www.cnn.com/2023/11/18/business/target-self-checkout-new-system/index.html). More retailers weighed changing the layout of some stores to funnel all shoppers through a single entrance, a staple security protocol at Best Buy and Costco. Best Buy at one point said it [added more workers](https://www.foxbusiness.com/markets/best-buy-combating-theft-higher-staffing-levels-stores#:~:text=A%20surge%20in%20retail%20theft,a%20simple%20solution%3A%20More%20manpower.) to walk the floor, which experts say helps deter many criminals.

### Transcript

LEILA FADEL, HOST:

If you shop in a big city, you've probably seen products locked behind Plexiglas. This became common as a long list of retailers rang the alarms about theft in recent years - Walmart, Home Depot, Macy's, Best Buy. But now the tone seems to be shifting. NPR's Alina Selyukh tries to find out why.

ALINA SELYUKH, BYLINE: Here's how we know there's a shift. One company was the most vocal on thefts last year - Target. The chain closed stores citing retail crime and even put a number on it, suggesting it cost upward of $1 billion. Now listen to the word CEO Brian Cornell kept using this month.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

BRIAN CORNELL: I'll start with the word progress. I think our teams have made significant progress - really solid progress.

SELYUKH: The fever pitch on retail theft seems to be cooling. So far this year, a handful of companies told investors a huge problem remains, but a few described it as neutral or improving, and many didn't mention it at all. So what's changed? There are a few answers, some of which are murky, and the first one is the most visible. New security measures on display during my visit to a Target in Washington, D.C.

There's a guard and an armed guard at the door. There's an Ulta Beauty store within the store where literally everything is locked away. It's like five aisles of everything locked. This cream says, try me, but you can't actually try it without calling someone to unlock it first.

This doesn't feel like progress for a shopper, but retailers say for thefts, their security investments have started to work. So that's one answer. The second answer could be that theft has improved because high-risk stores have simply closed. This one's trickier. Take Target and Walgreens, which closed stores blaming crime. Later, journalists crunched police data and found that companies kept open nearby stores that actually reported more crime incidents - just likely were also more profitable. So skeptics argue maybe the real answer is that retailers simply overstated the problem to begin with.

MARK COHEN: It's probably a play on retailers' parts in appealing to legislators.

SELYUKH: Mark Cohen is a former retail executive, now at the Columbia Business School. He's talking about one more possible answer to what's changed - new laws that retailers had long lobbied for. Congress moved to make it harder to resell stolen stuff on Amazon or Facebook. Some states and cities have set harsher prison sentences for thieves. Retailers say this is helping fix the crime problem. Cohen still thinks the timing is peculiar. Crime took center stage as more retailers reported lackluster financial results and suddenly cited theft as a factor.

CORNELL: They clearly are saying they've incurred some unusual and substantial uptick. Whether that's a cop-out or an accurate characterization, we just will never know.

SELYUKH: And here's why. When retailers talk about theft, they tend to use the term shrink. It's much broader. It means inventory that's missing for any reason. The industry estimates that theft by outsiders accounts for just over a third of shrink. Theft by employees is between a quarter and a third, and another quarter of shrink is mistakes and errors in tracking or accounting. And a retailer itself may not have the clearest picture. Katherine Black is with a consulting firm Kearney.

KATHERINE BLACK: The only data that exists really is, hey, we have this inventory. We don't have it now. And we can kind of maybe map it to a security camera, but that actually is a capability that most retailers don't use in that way.

SELYUKH: And they disclose little about any of it. We do have an industry survey on shrink and crime data. Neither shows any big nationwide shifts on theft. Of course, plenty of stores never report to the police, and broad numbers can mask trouble in specific places. Shoplifting likely did grow in a few cities while declining in many others. To Black, the most explicit evidence of a problem is actually those locked products. Polls show they really turn off shoppers, yet stores still do it.

BLACK: Trust me, they would not be talking about retail theft and putting in place a lot of the measures that they are if they didn't have to.

SELYUKH: And so it seems the answer to what's changed with retail crime is maybe all of the above. Several financial analysts dug into retail theft a few months back. They surmised that some retailers likely did face a rise in theft, but that some companies also likely used crime as a cover to close unprofitable stores or make up for their own missteps.
