- en: A new feature in Grok-1.5 is the capability to process long contexts of up to
    128K tokens within its context window. This allows Grok to have an increased memory
    capacity of up to 16 times the previous context length, enabling it to utilize
    information from substantially longer documents.

- en: Furthermore, the model can handle longer and more complex prompts, while still
    maintaining its instruction-following capability as its context window expands.
    In the Needle In A Haystack (NIAH) evaluation, Grok-1.5 demonstrated powerful
    retrieval capabilities for embedded text within contexts of up to 128K tokens
    in length, achieving perfect retrieval results.

- en: Cutting-edge Large Language Model (LLMs) research that runs on massive GPU clusters
    demands robust and flexible infrastructure. Grok-1.5 is built on a custom distributed
    training framework based on JAX, Rust, and Kubernetes. This training stack enables
    our team to prototype ideas and train new architectures at scale with minimal
    effort. A major challenge of training LLMs on large compute clusters is maximizing
    reliability and uptime of the training job. Our custom training orchestrator ensures
    that problematic nodes are automatically detected and ejected from the training
    job. We also optimized checkpointing, data loading, and training job restarts
    to minimize downtime in the event of a failure. If working on our training stack
    sounds interesting to you, [apply to join the team](https://x.ai/careers).

    your feedback to help us improve Grok. As we gradually roll out Grok-1.5 to a
    wider audience, we are excited to introduce several new features over the coming
    days.
