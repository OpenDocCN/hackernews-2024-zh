    the two-pronged strategy BYD has adopted to take the automotive world by storm—and
    potentially blow legacy carmakers out of the water.

    $236,000 [“dancing” electric supercar](https://www.topspeed.com/byd-yangwang-u9-three-wheel-sorcery/)
    and an $11,000 plug-in hybrid. The two cars couldn’t be more different on the
    surface, but they are linked by BYD’s technical prowess in batteries and its ability
    to develop and crank out new cells at scale, all at low cost.

    get its Ultium nickel cobalt manganese (NCM) batteries and [EVs](https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/evs)
    out the factory door. In contrast, BYD was founded in 1995 by Chinese chemist
    Wang Chuanfu as a humble maker of nickel cadmium cells for phones, with zero automotive
    experience. Yet BYD is turning that apparent disadvantage into a potentially game-changing
    edge today. The [Warren Buffett–backed](https://www.reuters.com/business/berkshire-hathaway-sells-258-mln-worth-shares-chinas-byd-2023-10-31/)
    Chinese automaker sold more electrified vehicles in 2023 than any global automaker,
    moving 1.6 million EVs and another 1.4 million hybrids. (Tesla still boasted more
    sales of pure EVs, at more than 1.8 million.)

    NCM batteries in some form, the 947-kilowatt (1,287-horsepower) Yangwang U9 will
    rely on the same lithium-iron phosphate “Blade” cells that power other BYD models.
    Those LFP cells, built by BYD’s FinDreams division, have attracted global customers
    of Tesla, Ford, and Hyundai; others are drawn to the cells’ thermal stability
    and affordable chemistry, which requires neither pricey cobalt nor the ethical
    baggage of mining in central Africa.

    Limited (CATL) may be dominating the LFP market and supply chain. But the technology
    itself traces to the University of Texas and the late [Nobel laureate John Goodenough](https://spectrum.ieee.org/john-goodenough-tribute),
    who helped pioneer what is today the hottest chemistry in EVs.

    scissor-doored supercar integrates an active body-control system that recalls
    modified Chevy Impalas and other low-riders of yore. The U9’s Disus X system integrates
    active dampers, air springs, and hydraulics to control body motions along multiple
    axes, building a foundation for both high-performance handling and future advanced
    driver assistance systems (ADAS). But the disco-party trick is a set of four “dance

    hour), and blitz 100 kph in less than 2.4 seconds. The gasoline-powered [McLaren
    750S](https://www.autoblog.com/2024/02/26/mclaren-750s-review/) I just drove on
    track and in the Mojave Desert in Nevada does it in 2.3 seconds and peaks at 206
    mph, but it costs about $331,000 to start. BYD further pegs the U9’s driving range
    at 465 kilometers (289 miles), with the ability to charge at up to 500 kW, which
    would theoretically fill its lithium-iron phosphate pack from 30 to 80 percent
    in 10 minutes. (With the most powerful public chargers operating closer to 300
    kW, that claim would hinge on a next generation of ultrafast chargers.)

    for cost savings in batteries, motors, and manufacturing. Taking a page from Tesla,
    BYD is leveraging its battery and manufacturing expertise to put the heat on competitors.
    BYD rolled out a new version of its [plug-in hybrid Qin Plus DM-i](https://cnevpost.com/2023/02/10/byd-launches-qin-plus-dm-i-2023-disrupt-conventional-fuel-car/),
    priced *20 percent* below the previous model. Priced from 79,800 yuan in China
    (US $11,100), the latest Qin Plus will undercut the price of popular gasoline-powered
    models such as Toyota’s Corolla. The plug-in hybrid can range for 55 km on its
    battery alone before switching to gasoline propulsion.

    200,000 of them by year’s end. The hatchback sells for the U.S. equivalent of
    about $11,500, cutting costs through extreme vertical integration and LFP batteries.
    The Seagull has only about 75 horsepower, and wasn’t designed to meet U.S. crash
    standards, but it can range for about 402 km (250 miles) on a charge, for less
    than half the price of any EV sold in America.

- en: If that’s not enough, BYD recently broke ground on its first factory for sodium-ion
    cells, a $1.4 billion facility with a planned annual capacity of 30 gigawatt-hours.
    Like LFP before it, sodium-ion cells were viewed with disdain not long ago. That’s
    changed, quickly. The abundant alkaline metal sells for less than 5 percent of
    the price of lithium, though the lack of a supply chain and manufacturing scale
    still present challenges. Sodium-ion batteries can’t match the energy density
    of lithium-ion, and both life-cycle and cold-weather operation were historically
    poor, but Chinese companies say that’s all improving. Pluses include outstanding
    thermal stability and safety, and the elimination of toxic and expensive lithium,
    cobalt, copper, or nickel.

    Seagull. But in late December, the [JAC Group’s Yiwei,](https://www.arenaev.com/jac_group_delivers_first_evs_with_sodiumion_battery-news-2967.php)
    partly owned by Volkswagen, began rolling off an assembly line, powered by sodium-based
    cathodes in its battery pack. [CATL](https://www.catl.com/en/), a BYD competitor
    and the world’s largest battery producer, says it has developed a way to combine
    sodium- and lithium-ion cells in a single pack, taking advantage of both lithium’s
    superior energy density and the affordability and cold-weather performance of
    sodium.

    stymied in part by a steep 25 percent tariff on Chinese cars first enacted by
    the Trump administration. As reported by *The New York Times*, President Biden
    piled national security concerns atop existing trade barriers on 29 February 2024\.
    The administration is moving to [block Web-connected Chinese cars](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/29/us/politics/biden-chinese-electric-vehicles.html#:~:text=President%20Biden%20took%20steps%20on,send%20sensitive%20information%20to%20Beijing.)
    from the U.S. market, citing potential national risks from spyware that could
    track cars and drivers and send sensitive data to Beijing. The *Times* quoted
    Biden’s statement saying, “China is determined to dominate the future of the auto
    market, including by using unfair practices. China’s policies could flood our
    markets with its vehicles, posing risks to our national security. I’m not going
    to let that happen on my watch.”

    company had no plans to send cars to the United States, even as it studies the
    feasibility of opening a [factory in Mexico](https://insideevs.com/news/708540/byd-mexico-tesla-china/).
    But BYD has gained a foothold in Australia and a beachhead in European markets
    that has raised concerns among European governments and potential rivals. BYD
    has also found a trickle of sales in Brazil and Mexico. And with the China-built,
    roughly $35,000 Volvo EX30 about to go on sale here—I drove it in Spain for *[IEEE
    Spectrum](https://spectrum.ieee.org/)* back in November—most analysts and automakers
    believe it’s a matter of time before a wave of Chinese cars arrives in the United
    States. The worry is that these cars will overwhelm rivals with appealing tech
    at bargain prices, driven by low-cost labor, that even Tesla can’t match. [Elon
    Musk](https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/elon-musk) himself has sounded alarms and
    called for strict trade barriers against Chinese cars. But for U.S. automakers—including
    the profitable Tesla as well as Ford and GM, which have yet to crack the money-making
    code on EVs—it may be time to stop pointing fingers and start competing.
