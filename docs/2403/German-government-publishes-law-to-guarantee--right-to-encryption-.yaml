    with client-side scanning, the German government now steps up for protecting citizen's
    right to privacy. This comes at no surprise as [Germany is known for its strong
    data protection laws](https://tuta.com/blog/data-privacy-germany), which are also
    one of the reasons why Tuta is based in Germany.

    we are based – exactly at the time when we are celebrating ten years of Tuta (formerly
    Tutanota). Ten years ago the world’s first end-to-end encrypted email provider
    was launched in Germany.

    now the industry standard, individual messenger services do not use end-to-end
    encryption or only use it for certain functions, without this being justified
