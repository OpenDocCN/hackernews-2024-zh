    a chemical by combining nitrogen from the air with hydrogen. As a carrier for
    hydrogen, ammonia can be transported to demand centres for power generation and
    as a marine fuel in support of the energy transition. Several dual-fueled ammonia
    vessels have been ordered by shipowners.

    the vessel at Seatrium’s Benoi yard from July 2023\. This included the installation
    of the gas fuel delivery system, safety systems and infrastructure, and the successful
    conversion of two of the vessel’s four engines to enable the use of ammonia, combined
    with diesel in the combustion process, to power the vessel.  The two remaining
    engines onboard the Fortescue Green Pioneer will operate on conventional fuels
    when required.

    of Excellence (MESD), the Technology Centre for Offshore and Marine, Singapore

    in an event of an incident, and to support the safety and incident response planning.
    The model, which accounted for the Fortescue Green Pioneer’s vessel and engine
    design parameters, behaviour of ammonia within Singapore’s tropical climate, sea
    current conditions, and surrounding vessels, infrastructure, and geometries, was
    used to guide the operations. It will be continually enhanced as operations for
    new maritime fuels scale up in the Port of Singapore.

    conducted in phases to ensure safe port operations and safety for crew members
    and engineers who have completed a series of rigorous training sessions since
    October 2023\. As part of the safety protocols for the conduct of these tests,
    crew members also donned personal protection equipment such as chemical protection
    suits, nitrile chemical gloves, rubber boots, positive pressure mask and hood,
    and portable gas detectors for the relevant operations.

    green is green. Anything else is made from fossil fuels. The Fortescue Green Pioneer
    is proof that safe, technical solutions for ammonia power engines exist. But as
    I did at COP 28 in Dubai, I am once again calling on the world’s ports to get
    on with setting fair, safe and stringent fuel standards for green ammonia and
    not shy away from their responsibilities simply because of a lack of character.
    We must push to see global emitters paying fair carbon prices for heavy fuels
    used in traditional shipping. These prices must provide clear investment signals
    to drive green investment.”
