    customers don't appear to care that Toyota has so far released only one pretty

    shoppers in a recent survey — beating out [Ford and Elon Musk's Tesla](https://www.businessinsider.com/ev-demand-still-strong-despite-slowdown-hybrids-survey-2024-1).
    It would appear Toyota's more hybrid-heavy approach to electric cars is alluring
    for the new breed of electric-car shopper, more frugal and practical than the
    early adopters that came before them.

    of GBK, a consulting firm that did the survey, told Business Insider. "Other manufacturers

    has long been a skeptic of the industry's all-in attitude on battery-powered vehicles,
    preaching instead the importance of Toyota's "multipathway approach," in which
    the automaker is researching and developing a variety of alternatives to the internal-combustion
    engine.
