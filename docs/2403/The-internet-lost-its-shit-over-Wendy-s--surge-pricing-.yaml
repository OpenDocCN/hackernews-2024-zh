    LinkedIn algorithm had served me a conversation between two tech bros who were
    talking about a news story from a foodie website. Wendy’s, the fast food chain,
    planned to introduce “surge pricing.” Basically, AI would change the price of
    your hamburger, based on market demand. Tech Bro #1 said it was a “gangsta move,”
    but Tech Bro #2 disagreed. “It’s a baller move,” he wrote.'

    out, the tech bros and their praise for greedy business models were out of step
    with, well, everyone. People on social media dunked on Wendy’s by saying the fast
    food chain would get a “frosty response.” Others called Wendy’s “trash.” On the
    *Today Show*, Hoda slammed Wendy’s. Then the internet surfaced this gem:'

    the term “surge pricing.” That was true! But the source of the story had been
    this statement from the Wendy’s CEO:'

    for “surge pricing.” And predictably, the AI angle only added fuel to the fire.
    Like everyone else on the internet, I didn’t know who to believe. But I was also
    hungry. So I took $1 million out of petty cash, just in case the rumors were true,
    and headed for the nearest Wendy’s.

    humans working that shift and both had left the fries unattended. But I didn’t
    mind waiting while the Wendy’s employees unfucked the fryer and dealt with a horn-happy
    customer at the drive-thru. The extra time gave me a chance to check the menu.

    and the Loaded Nacho Cheeseburger. But novelty burgers were beside the point.
    Like Snoop Dogg, my mind was on my money, and my money was on my mind. I only
    had a million bucks in my pocket, and according to the internet, that might not
    be enough for a combo meal.

    anonymous. So, I handed the cashier a picture of Andrew Jackson, and she handed
    me lunch.
