    LinkedIn algorithm had served me a conversation between two tech bros who were
    talking about a news story from a foodie website. Wendy’s, the fast food chain,
    planned to introduce “surge pricing.” Basically, AI would change the price of
    your hamburger, based on market demand. Tech Bro #1 said it was a “gangsta move,”
    but Tech Bro #2 disagreed. “It’s a baller move,” he wrote.'

    out, the tech bros and their praise for greedy business models were out of step
    with, well, everyone. People on social media dunked on Wendy’s by saying the fast
    food chain would get a “frosty response.” Others called Wendy’s “trash.” On the
    *Today Show*, Hoda slammed Wendy’s. Then the internet surfaced this gem:'

    of empathy and snark.

    card.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The shit show paired nicely with my morning coffee, but then I remembered that
    I was on deadline. So I closed my browser, said a silent prayer for the poor bastards
    on the Wendy’s communications team, and dove into my client’s copy.

    back-peddling. Sort of. The Wendy’s comms team insisted that they’d never used
    the term “surge pricing.” That was true! But the source of the story had been
    this statement from the Wendy’s CEO:'

- en: '[We] will begin testing more enhanced features like dynamic pricing and daypart
    offerings, along with AI-enabled menu changes and suggestive selling.'
  prefs:
  - PREF_BQ
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Of course, a lot of people pointed out that “dynamic pricing” was a euphemism
    for “surge pricing.” And predictably, the AI angle only added fuel to the fire.
    Like everyone else on the internet, I didn’t know who to believe. But I was also
    hungry. So I took $1 million out of petty cash, just in case the rumors were true,
    and headed for the nearest Wendy’s.

    humans working that shift and both had left the fries unattended. But I didn’t
    mind waiting while the Wendy’s employees unfucked the fryer and dealt with a horn-happy
    customer at the drive-thru. The extra time gave me a chance to check the menu.
  prefs: []

- en: Everything on the menu looked normal. Well, everything except the Baconator
    and the Loaded Nacho Cheeseburger. But novelty burgers were beside the point.
    Like Snoop Dogg, my mind was on my money, and my money was on my mind. I only
    had a million bucks in my pocket, and according to the internet, that might not
    be enough for a combo meal.

    I want to lock in the price for a chicken sandwich combo meal.”

    of your mortgage can change a lot between when you put in an offer and when you
    close. I’m worried that the same thing will happen with my chicken sandwich combo.”

    lean into an absurd premise. So I explained the internet shit show.

    for my wallet, but hesitated.

    return the gesture. Something about the health code.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Normally, I’d use my card to get the airline miles. But all I had was the cashier’s
    word. I believed her, but I didn’t trust the surge-pricing enthusiasts at Wendy’s
    corporate. Better to pay cash, I thought. Keep this chicken sandwich transaction
    anonymous. So, I handed the cashier a picture of Andrew Jackson, and she handed
    me lunch.
