- en: Feb. 16 started like any typical Friday night. My husband and I decided to stay
    home, grill chicken and make a salad for dinner. At about 6:45 p.m., we heard
    some loud rumbling overhead.

    lights all over our property, and a recording echoed, "Police. You are under arrest.
    Stay right there and I won't shoot you."

    with a few dogs were circling our property. One of the guys said, “Yeah, there’s
    a jammer right here.” He picked it up. I leaned over the patio and asked, “What’s
    going on?”

    from. The jammer says you might have been next. Do we have permission to enter
    your property?” I said, “Yes!” and then he asked something like, “If we find anyone,
    will you pursue charges so we can arrest them?” I replied, “Of course!”

    tossed the police keys to open the security gates. It turns out that when the
    gang saw we were home, they likely diverted their attention to the house next
    door. A house four doors down from us wasn't so lucky.

    cameras were offline at 5:05 pm. He thought the internet went down. The gang broke
    in and took $25,000 in cash and valuables worth $100,000\. They were in and out
    in less than 10 minutes.

    This way, security cameras and phones are useless. A Phoenix police officer told
    me the gang probably noticed nothing was down in our house.

    tried to jam the Wi-Fi signals, the security camera’s red lights showed they were
    recording everything. We also still have a landline.

    anything. On the upside, the gang doesn't carry guns. If they get caught, they'll
    spend about six months in jail before being extradited to Chile.

    and look up homes on real estate sites to get an idea of where the primary bedroom
    is located. They look for dogs, too.

    A friend was robbed by a similar gang in a guard-gated community in California.
    Kudos to Phoenix Police – they arrested three members of the gang who were in
    my neighborhood that night.
