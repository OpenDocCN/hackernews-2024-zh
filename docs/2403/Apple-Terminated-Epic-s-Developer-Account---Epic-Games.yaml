    our developer account. This sends a strong signal to developers that the European
    Commission will act swiftly to enforce the Digital Markets Act and hold gatekeepers
    accountable. We are moving forward as planned to launch the Epic Games Store and
    bring Fortnite back to iOS in Europe. Onward!**

- en: We recently [announced](https://x.com/EpicNewsroom/status/1758516979705557241?s=20)
    that Apple approved our Epic Games Sweden AB developer account. We intended to
    use that account to bring the Epic Games Store and Fortnite to iOS devices in
    Europe thanks to the Digital Markets Act (DMA). To our surprise, Apple has terminated
    that account and now we cannot develop the Epic Games Store for iOS. This is a
    serious violation of the DMA and shows Apple has no intention of allowing true
    competition on iOS devices.

- en: 'The DMA requires Apple to allow third-party app stores, like the Epic Games
    Store. Article 6(4) of the DMA says: “The gatekeeper shall allow and technically
    enable the installation and effective use of third-party software applications
    or software application stores using, or interoperating with, its operating system
    and allow those software applications or software application stores to be accessed
    by means other than the relevant core platform services of that gatekeeper.”'

    potential competitors to the Apple App Store. They are undermining our ability
    to be a viable competitor and they are showing other developers what happens when
    you try to compete with Apple or are critical of their unfair practices.

    sole discretion, no reasonable developer would be willing to  utilize a third
    party app store, because they could be permanently separated from their audience
    at any time.

- en: Apple said one of the reasons they terminated our developer account only a few
    weeks after approving it was because we publicly criticized their proposed DMA
    compliance plan. Apple cited [this X post](https://x.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1762243725533532587?s=20)
    from [this thread](https://x.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1762243716973015465?s=20)
    written by Tim Sweeney. Apple is retaliating against Epic for speaking out against
    Apple’s unfair and illegal practices, just as they’ve done to other developers
    time and time again.

    unjustified excuse to terminate one of our accounts. Apple has been a long-time
    public supporter of Unreal Engine. We also have had ongoing contractual relationships
    with Apple going back to 2010 for Epic’s games, Unreal Engine, and our other creator
