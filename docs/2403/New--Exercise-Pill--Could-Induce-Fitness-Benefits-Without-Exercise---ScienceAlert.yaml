    exercise into a swallowable pill.

- en: The novel drug is [in the very early stages of development](https://news.ufl.edu/2023/09/exercise-mimicking-drug/),
    but in initial experiments on rodents, the medicine appears to tap into a natural
    metabolic pathway usually triggered by exercise.

- en: When administered to mice daily, the drug, called SLU-PP-332, seems to improve
    muscle function, fitness, and endurance – all without the animals having to move
    more than they're used to.

    or too challenging to trigger with pharmaceuticals. But that may not be the case
    after all.

    Elgendy [thinks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIcUrSIEa-4&ab_channel=AmericanChemicalSocietyMeetingNewsroom)
    it "could lead to the development of therapeutics for some of the most challenging
    diseases we are facing today, like neurodegenerative diseases and heart failure."

    health in a wide variety of ways, but one pathway with particularly impressive
    health benefits triggers [estrogen-related receptors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estrogen-related_receptor)
    (ERRs).

    are known to regulate a wide swathe of genes associated with metabolism, immunity,
    inflammation, homeostasis, development, cellular growth, and reproduction.

    of the only ways to get the ERR ball rolling, so to speak.

    Louis have been [working on a version of an ERR drug](https://jpet.aspetjournals.org/content/388/2/232.long)

    of ERR – a feat that has never been achieved before.

    together a startup pharmaceutical company, called Pelago Pharmaceuticals, which

    Elgendy and his colleagues have shown that when SLU-PP-332 is given to mice, it
    increases a fatigue-resistant type of muscle fiber in their bodies.

    them to run 70 percent longer and 45 percent further than those not receiving
    the drug. This is probably because their skeletal muscle cells are better able
    to maintain their energy balance.

    taking SLU-PP-332 twice a day for a month gained 10 times less fat than untreated
    mice, even though they kept eating the same amount of food and exercised the same
    amount as before.

    it does seem to trigger a molecular pathway that conveys many benefits of exercise
