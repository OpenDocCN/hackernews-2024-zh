    even pages themselves — these are all blocks, dynamic units of information that
    can be transformed into other block types or moved freely within Notion. They’re
    the LEGOs we use to build and model information. And when put together, blocks

    block, and will be rendered indented within. However, when the preceding block
    isn’t a list (or there’s no previous block at all), indenting will have no effect
    because there is nowhere to move the block into. The visual representation of
    a document in Notion reflects the structure of the information it contains.

    MessageStore using this WebSocket connection. When your friend opens the same

    it verifies that version of the block in its local cache. Because the versions
    from the notification and the local block are different, it sends a `syncRecordValues`
    API request to the sever with the list of outdated client records. The server
    responds with the new record data. The client uses this response data to update
    the local cache with the new version of the records, then re-renders the UI to

    descends from a starting point (likely the block ID of a page block) down the
    content tree, and returns the blocks in the content tree plus any dependent records
    needed to properly render those blocks. We use several layers of caching for `loadPageChunk`,
    but in the worst case, this API might need many trips to the database as it recursively
    crawls down the tree to chase down blocks and their record dependencies.
