# CatBoost - open-source gradient boosting library

> 来源：[https://catboost.ai/](https://catboost.ai/)

# Features

Reduce time spent on parameter tuning, because CatBoost provides great results with default parameters

Improve your training results with CatBoost that allows you to use non-numeric factors, instead of having to pre-process your data or spend time and effort turning it to numbers.

Train your model on a fast implementation of gradient-boosting algorithm for GPU. Use a multi-card configuration for large datasets.

Reduce overfitting when constructing your models with a novel gradient-boosting scheme.

Apply your trained model quickly and efficiently even to latency-critical tasks using CatBoost's model applier

# About

CatBoost is an algorithm for **gradient boosting on decision trees**. It is developed by Yandex researchers and engineers, and is used for search, recommendation systems, personal assistant, self-driving cars, weather prediction and many other tasks at Yandex and in other companies, including CERN, Cloudflare, Careem taxi. It is in open-source and can be used by anyone.
