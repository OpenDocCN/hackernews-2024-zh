    to be made that completely autonomous vehicles (AVs) will *never* [take over everyday

    Regardless, some [urban planners](https://www.popsci.com/technology/smart-intersections-chattanooga-tennessee/)
    are already looking into ensuring how such a future could be as safe and efficient.
    According to a team at [North Carolina State University](https://news.ncsu.edu/2024/03/traffic-signal-pedestrians-vehicles/#:~:text=%E2%80%9COur%20earlier%20work%20introduced%20the,%2C%E2%80%9D%20says%20Ali%20Hajbabaie%2C%20corresponding),
    one solution may be upending the more-than-century-old design of [traffic signals.](https://www.popsci.com/technology/smart-city-adaptive-traffic/)

    actually [codified in an international accord](https://www.inclusivecitymaker.com/1868-2019-a-brief-history-of-traffic-lights/)
    dating back to 1931\. This has served drivers pretty well since then, but the
    NC State team argues AVs could eventually create the opportunity for better road
    conditions. Or, at the very least, could benefit from some infrastructure adjustments.

    associate professor Ali Hajbabaie [created a computer model](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10038635)
    for city commuting patterns which indicated everyday driving could one day actually
    improve from a sizable influx of AVs. By sharing their copious amounts of real-time
    sensor information with one another, Hajbabaie and colleagues believe these vehicles
    could hypothetically coordinate far beyond simple intersection changes to adjust
    variables like speed and break times.

    “white” light to traffic signals. In this scenario, the “white” phase activates
    whenever enough interconnected AVs approach an intersection. Once lit, the phase
    indicates nearby drivers should simply follow the car (AV or human) in front of
    them, instead of trying to anticipate something like a yellow light’s transition
    time to red. Additionally, such interconnectivity could communicate with traffic
    signal systems to determine when it is best for “Walk” and “Do-Not-Walk” pedestrian
    signals. Based on their modeling, it appeared such a change could reduce intersection
    congestion by at least 40-percent compared to current traffic system optimization
    software. In doing so, this could improve overall travel times, fuel efficiency,
    and safety.

    atop existing signals, don’t worry—the “white” is just a theoretical stand-in
    until regulators decide on something clearer.

    in an email to *PopSci*. “Any indication/color could be used as long as it does
    not associate with any existing message and does not create confusion.”

- en: This initial model had a pretty glaring limitation, however—it did not really
    take pedestrians into much consideration. In the year since, Hajbabaie’s team
    has updated their four-phase traffic light computer model to account for this
    crucial factor in urban traffic. According to their new results published in [C*omputer-Aided
    Civil Infrastructure and Engineering*](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/mice.13178),
    the NC State researchers determined that even with humans commuting by foot, an
    additional fourth light could reduce delays at intersections by as much as 25-percent
    from current levels.

- en: Granted, this massive reduction is dependent on an “almost universal adoption
    of AVs,” Hajbabaie said in a [separate announcement](https://news.ncsu.edu/2024/03/traffic-signal-pedestrians-vehicles/#:~:text=%E2%80%9COur%20earlier%20work%20introduced%20the,%2C%E2%80%9D%20says%20Ali%20Hajbabaie%2C%20corresponding)
    this week. Given the current state of the industry, such a future seems much further
    down the road than many have hoped. But while not a distinct possibility at the
    moment, the team still believes even a modest increase in AVs on roads—coupled
    with something like this fourth “white” phase—could improve conditions in an extremely
    meaningful way. What’s more, Hajbabaie says that waiting for fully autonomous
    cars may not be necessary.

    cruise control and some sort of lateral movement controller such as lane keeping
    feature,” he tells *PopSci*. “Having said that, we think we would require more
    sensors in the intersection vicinity to be able to observe the location of vehicles
    if they are not equipped with all the sensors that smart cars will be equipped
    with.”

    best to just keep investing in [green urban planning projects](https://www.popsci.com/science/complete-streets-open-city-design-pandemic/)
    like [cycling lanes](https://www.popsci.com/diy/biking-safety-tips/), protected
    walkways, and [even e-bikes](https://www.popsci.com/gear/best-electric-commuter-bikes/).
    They’re simpler, and more eco-friendly.
