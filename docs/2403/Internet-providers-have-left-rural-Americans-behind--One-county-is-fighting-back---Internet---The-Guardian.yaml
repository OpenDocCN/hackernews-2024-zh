    Foster said. Parents can’t work from home with internet access. Even job applications
    might be out of reach without a decent connection. **“**The days are gone when
    you can walk into the grocery store and fill out a paper application,” he said.

    what it will do with money from the Bead program. Crucially, the plan has to explain
    how the state will reduce or eliminate barriers for municipalities to use the

    law says that they can’t exclude municipal government from applying for grants,
    and making them ineligible for the grant. As part of our rules, we ask for states

    than make one big investment, Stritzinger said. Those grants are going out to
    any entity he thinks can use the money effectively. As an experiment and demonstration,
    Metts and Charter Communications are working together to wire one Orangeburg county
    town center - Norway, population 337 – like it’s a Manhattan Starbucks.

    putting digital infrastructure in does all of the stuff that I think it’s gonna
    do. We’re looking to unlock the magic.”
