    have become available. Yet I took the opportunity to re-record a more complete
    version of my talk that I want to share with you.

    [Ben](https://genodians.org/atopia), and me, a delegation of four Genodians attended
    FOSDEM this year. We prepared to participate in two developer rooms in particular.
    Johannes introduced our [Goa SDK](https://fosdem.org/2024/schedule/event/fosdem-2024-3089-streamlining-application-development-for-genode-with-goa)
    at the [microkernel](https://fosdem.org/2024/schedule/track/microkernel/) developer
    room whereas I presented our recent [mobile-phone line of work](https://fosdem.org/2024/schedule/event/fosdem-2024-3017-genode-on-the-pinephone-on-track-to-real-world-usability/)
    at the [FOSS-on-mobile](https://fosdem.org/2024/schedule/track/foss-on-mobile-devices/)
    developer room.

    So I could attend only half of each session. I found the variety of topics presented
    at the FOSS-on-mobile room simply delightful. For me personally, the presentations
    of [U-Boot for modern Qualcomm phones](https://fosdem.org/2024/schedule/event/fosdem-2024-1716-u-boot-for-modern-qualcomm-phones/)
    and [The Universal Serial Bug](https://fosdem.org/2024/schedule/event/fosdem-2024-3200-universal-serial-bug-a-tale-of-spontaneous-modem-resets/)
    stood out the most. I wish I had seen the excellent lecture [From phone hardware
    to mobile Linux](https://fosdem.org/2024/schedule/event/fosdem-2024-2234-from-phone-hardware-to-mobile-linux/)
    before I started my work with the PinePhone. Regarding my own talk about [Genode
    on the PinePhone on track to real-world usability](https://fosdem.org/2024/schedule/event/fosdem-2024-3017-genode-on-the-pinephone-on-track-to-real-world-usability/),
    I was apparently bit overly ambitious with the breadth of topics I wanted to cover,
    running out of time. Of the three demos I had prepared, I could show only one.

    all demos as intended.

    developer room. Watching Udo Steinberg presenting his work on NOVA is always a
    feat, and this year's talk [Using the NOVA Microhypervisor for Trusted Computing
    at Scale](https://fosdem.org/2024/schedule/event/fosdem-2024-3227-using-the-nova-microhypervisor-for-trusted-computing-at-scale/)
    is no exception. It goes without saying that I was very much looking forward to
    Johannes' presentation about [Streamlining application development for Genode
    with Goa](https://fosdem.org/2024/schedule/event/fosdem-2024-3089-streamlining-application-development-for-genode-with-goa/).

- en: I must admit that I found the slew of unikernel-specific talks in the microkernel
    developer room a bit irritating. That might be strange as I vividly remember finding
    much joy in Antti Kantee's talk on [Rump Kernels, Just Components](https://archive.fosdem.org/2014/schedule/event/01_uk_rump_kernels/),
    in 2014 or Martin Lucina's talk on the [Solo5 unikernel](https://archive.fosdem.org/2019/schedule/event/solo5_unikernels/)
    in 2019, both of which spawned curiosity and synergetic effects with the microkernel
    community. This time, however, I completely failed to draw the connection between
    the presented unikernel projects and the microkernel world. Whereas microkernel
    architectures are all about the separation of concerns, unikernels are all about
    removing means of separation. The common ground seems to come down to a few low-level
    programming tidbits. I'm aware that the words above may come across as dismissive.
    That's not my intention as each of the projects is clearly an affair of heart
    and has technical merits. They just happen to be neither component-based operating
    systems nor microkernel-related.

    Hence, the best way to reestablish the clear focus of the microkernel devroom
    would be for open-source microkernel projects to submit strong submissions next
    time.

    and through entertaining way, Daniel Stenberg claimed [You too could have made
    curl!](https://fosdem.org/2024/schedule/event/fosdem-2024-1931-you-too-could-have-made-curl-/)
    Another highlight was certainly Neal Walfield's talk about [Sequoia PGP](https://fosdem.org/2024/schedule/event/fosdem-2024-3297-sequoia-pgp-rethinking-openpgp-tooling/),
    which gives me the cosy feeling that the best days of OpenPGP are still ahead
    of us.

    of Free Software and Open Source and their respective projects. As one particularly
    encounter to remember, I had the pleasure of demoing Sculpt OS on the PinePhone
    and handing over a copy of my [Genode Platforms](https://genode.org/documentation/genode-platforms-23-05.pdf)
    book - which is essentially a book about the PinePhone - to the people behind
    the PinePhone. The warm and enthusiastic response of Lukasz and Tl caught me totally
    by surprise.

    from Dresden to Brussels was the worst train ride I ever experienced. People complimented
    out of overcrowded ICE trains? Check. Two hours standing just besides the train
    toilet, inhaling fumes of varying intensity? Check. Medical emergency stop? Check.
    Hours upon hours of delay? Check. On the bright side, the travel back from Brussels
    to Dresden was the smoothest ride imaginable. Chances are fifty-fifty.
