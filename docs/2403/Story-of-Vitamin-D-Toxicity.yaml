- en: First, though, imagine that someone in a public forum online asked me, “How
    much metoprolol (a common blood pressure medication) should I take?” It would
    be clear that I could not give a real answer. I could give a heavily qualified
    blanket statement that covered indications and common starting doses, and then
    recommended speaking with a doctor regarding a personalized dosage. I wouldn’t
    give a specific dose. But no one would expect me to. Metoprolol is a medication,
    and medications are usually prescribed by a physician.

    like this: “I understand that the evidence for Vitamin D in healthy adults doesn’t
    really show a benefit, but I take Vitamin D because it probably won’t hurt me,
    and it might help.” This is a common sentiment regarding supplements, but not
    a statement that most people would make about metoprolol, or any prescribed medication.
    Medications are generally understood to be substances taken in response to a specific
    disease or condition, and we hope that research has shown that they work. Supplements
    are given a pass; we take them if they might help, even though they may not be
    needed.'

- en: 'In the fall of 2018, Shannon R. was the special education director for a large
    Arizona school district. Normally energetic and expressive, the otherwise healthy
    38-year-old began having an odd and disturbing symptom: difficulty speaking. Her
    husband and two boys would ask her questions, and though understanding the question,
    she was unable to formulate the words to respond.'

    usual. As the months passed, new symptoms appeared: palpitations, insomnia, anxiety,
    along with cognitive deficits – “like my brain wouldn’t function,” she recalled.
    Her heart rate, normally in the 60s, now often stayed in the 90s, even while in
    bed. She barely slept at night and lost nearly 50 pounds. By mid-semester, she
    was often unable to work. At around 1 AM one October morning, she was taken to
    the emergency room for a racing heart. When there, she had difficulty responding
    to the doctors’ and nurses’ questions. After a full workup, the doctors had no
    explanation, so they resorted to what doctors often reach for when confronted
    with mystery ailments: psychiatric illness.'

- en: Shannon would be hospitalized several times for “catatonia,” a general symptom
    describing difficulty with speaking or moving that is caused by certain psychiatric
    conditions like depression and schizophrenia. Though she had never exhibited mental
    illness before, doctors assumed that Shannon had developed a severe psychiatric
    disorder.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Shannon’s husband, as well as her new psychiatrist, doubted this diagnosis,
    and sought second and third opinions. By the time she contacted me four months
    later, they had consulted multiple specialists at three different hospitals around
    the state, but still did not have an explanation for her physical and mental decline.
    There was something that all of the doctors had noticed, though. Her blood calcium
    levels were often mildly to moderately elevated above normal, up to 11.1 mg/dl
    (normal for her age would be up to 10.2 mg/dl). The cause of this was unclear,
    but her doctors did not believe that this incidental finding was relevant to her
    current issues, and did not pursue it. **Shannon was not taking calcium supplements
    at all throughout this time, but her levels were still high.** When she emailed
    me in February 2019, she was desperate for answers and thought the calcium levels
    might be a clue.

- en: My specialty is parathyroid disease, which is the most common cause of high
    calcium. Based on her parathyroid hormone tests, it did not appear that Shannon
    had parathyroid disease. But she had high calcium levels, and the rise in those
    levels correlated with the onset of her symptoms. High calcium levels might initially
    appear to be a good thing, since we need calcium for our bones. But they are not.
    High blood calcium levels usually indicate a serious illness.

    feel bad. They may develop insomnia and palpitations, a feeling like the heart
    is racing. Some have more severe neurologic symptoms like muscle weakness and
    problems with balance, and some have psychiatric symptoms like depression and
    anxiety. Untreated high calcium can also lead to kidney stones, kidney failure,
    cardiac arrhythmias, headaches, and gastrointestinal problems. Shannon had some
    of the classic symptoms, as well as what appeared to be more severe “psychiatric”
    symptoms. I suspected they were all related to her calcium levels.

    and they do a very good job at it, keeping blood calcium within a tight range.
    Usually, a problem with calcium indicates a problem with the parathyroids. But
    over the last few years I have had more patients coming to me with high calcium
    related to something else: Vitamin D.'

    estrogen and testosterone, and glucocorticoids like the stress hormone cortisol.
    Steroid hormones are all made from cholesterol, and looking at their molecular
    structures, you can see the similarities.'

    tiny amounts of the molecule are required to have substantial effects. Anyone
    who has gone through puberty understands the impressive physiologic changes brought
    about by relatively small shifts in hormone levels. Not surprisingly, most steroid
    hormones are considered medications that require a physician's order. Vitamin
    D is an exception. In the U.S., high dose Vitamin D can be purchased by anyone,
    without a prescription, in most drugstores and grocery stores. It is called a
    dietary supplement, which sounds safer than a medication, but this is misleading.
    Due to its role in calcium absorption, high dose Vitamin D can cause serious problems.

    with mild osteopenia, a thinning of the bones that can be a precursor to osteoporosis.
    Her Vitamin D was low at the time, so her physician started her on over-the-counter
    Vitamin D supplementation at 5000 international units (IUs) daily. Five years
    later, she was still on this dose, and her blood Vitamin D level had risen to
    79 ng/ml. This level is within what many labs call the normal range, between 30
    and 100 ng/ml, but levels above 70 are almost always a result of high dose supplementation,
    and I have seen toxicity with levels between 70 and 100 ng/ml. (A better “normal
    range” based on what I have seen would probably be between 30 and 60.) Vitamin
    D builds up over time, so the longer someone is on a high dose, the more likely
    she is to develop toxicity. Shannon’s calcium levels began rising in the fall
    of 2018, when her severe symptoms developed.'

    about taking her vitamins, and stopped taking Vitamin D in October. It often takes
    many months for high Vitamin D levels to drop, and it took six months for Shannon’s
    level to fall into the 50s. As it fell, her calcium level gradually started to
    normalize, and her symptoms slowly resolved. By May, she was starting to feel
    like herself again.

    and rapid decline in health had resolved completely. Listening to this animated
    woman, it was difficult to imagine her unable to talk. The only lingering effects
    appeared to be a wariness of physicians and distrust of vitamins, both understandable.
    Shannon agrees that Vitamin D should be treated like a medication. “It’s a hormone!”
    she exclaimed. “If I had to take ‘Hormone D’, I would have questioned my doctor
    about why I needed it.” Shannon is now committed to educating others about Vitamin
    D.

    there doing just fine on 5000 units of Vitamin D daily. I only see the ones who
    develop high calcium levels. But I see enough of them to know that this is not
    an exceptionally rare occurrence. I have been to lectures in which physicians
    have claimed that Vitamin D toxicity almost never occurs. In my experience, this
    is false. I have seen many cases of Vitamin D toxicity in people who were taking
    the recommended dose from an over-the-counter bottle.

    D to cause high calcium. They all believed that they were taking a supplement
    to improve health and that there was very little risk. Supplements don’t require
    prescriptions, and most do not have the warning labels that accompany medications.
    For Vitamin D, a steroid hormone, that may need to change.

    levels and low levels of the hormone called Vitamin D. The dose depends on your
    calcium and current Vitamin D levels, and needs to be adjusted appropriately in
    response to those levels. For my patients, I can and do give very specific recommendations
    on Vitamin D doses. In future posts, I can go through how I decide that. I will
    not give any recommendation without first knowing Vitamin D and calcium levels.
