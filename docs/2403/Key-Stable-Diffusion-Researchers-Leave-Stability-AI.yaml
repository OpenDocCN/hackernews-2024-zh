- en: The news was announced by CEO Emad Mostaque at an all-hands meeting last week,
    according to staff on the call and other sources familiar with the situation.
    Robin Rombach, who led the team, and fellow researchers Andreas Blattmann and
    Dominik Lorenz were three of the five authors who developed the core Stable Diffusion
    research while at a German university. They were hired afterwards by Stability.
    Last month, they helped publish a third edition of the Stable Diffusion model
    that for the first time combined the diffusion structure used in earlier versions
    with transformers used in OpenAI’s ChatGPT.

- en: Much of Stability’s success can be traced directly to the Stable Diffusion research,
    which was originally an academic project at Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich
    and Heidelberg University. Stability became involved seven months after the publication
    of the initial research paper when Mostaque offered the academics a tranche of
    his company’s computing resources to further develop the text-to-image model.
    Björn Ommer, the professor who supervised the research, [told](https://www.forbes.com/sites/kenrickcai/2023/06/04/stable-diffusion-emad-mostaque-stability-ai-exaggeration/?sh=7fbb5da575c5

    *Forbes* last year that he felt Stability misled the public on its contributions
    to Stable Diffusion when it launched in August 2022\. (At the time, Stability
    spokesperson Motez Bishara said Mostaque is “quick to praise and attribute the
    work of collaborators.”)

    AI craze, helping Mostaque secure more than $100 million from leading tech investment
    firms Coatue and Lightspeed within days of the launch. He used some of the funds
    to hire Ommer’s Ph.D. students Rombach, Blattmann and Lorenz. Their research has
    since kept Stability at the forefront of technical developments around generative
    AI imagery.

    profile technical departures from Stability AI. Vice presidents Christian Cantrell
    (product), Scott Draves (engineering), Patrick Hebron (research and development)
    and Joe Penna (applied machine learning) all left in the last year. Other notable
    departures include research chief David Ha and LLM leads Stanislav Fort and his
    successor Louis Castricato. Stability’s VP of audio Ed Newton-Rex resigned in
    November in a protest against Stability and other AI startups’ treatment of copyrighted

    fundraise that valued the company at $1 billion. Now, the company is facing a
    cash crunch, with spending on wages and compute power far outstripping revenue,
    according to documents seen by *Forbes.* [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-11-09/stability-ai-gets-intel-backing-in-new-financing

    earlier reported that the company was spending $8 million a month. In November
    2023, CEO Emad Mostaque tweeted that the company had generated $1.2 million in
    revenue in August, and would make $3 million in November. The tweet was later
    deleted.
