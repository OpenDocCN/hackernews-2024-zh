- en: 'In early 2023, climate scientists—and anyone else paying attention to the data—started
    to notice something strange. At the beginning of March, sea-surface temperatures
    began to rise. By April, they’d set a new record: the average temperature at the
    surface of the world’s oceans, excluding those at the poles, was just a shade
    under seventy degrees. Typically, the highest sea-surface temperatures of the
    year are observed in March, toward the end of the Southern Hemisphere’s summer.
    Last year, temperatures remained abnormally high through the Southern Hemisphere’s
    autumn and beyond, breaking the monthly records for May, June, July, and other
    months. The North Atlantic was particularly bathtub-like; in the words of Copernicus,
    an arm of the European Union’s space service, temperatures in the basin were “off
    the charts.”'

    February, they set yet another record. In a warming world, ocean temperatures
    are expected to rise and keep on rising. But, for the last twelve months, the
    seas have been so feverish that scientists are starting to worry about not just
    the physical impacts of all that heat but the theoretical implications. Can the
    past year be explained by what’s already known about climate change, or are there
    forces at work that haven’t been accounted for? And, if it’s the latter, does
    this mean that projections of warming, already decidedly grim, are underestimating
    the dangers?

    Goddard Institute for Space Studies, told me. “And we haven’t really known what’s
    going on since about March of last year.” He called the situation “disquieting.”

    in the cool—or La Niña—phase of a climate pattern that goes by the acronym *ENSO*.
    By summer, an El Niño—or warm phase—had begun. Since ocean temperatures started
    to climb before the start of El Niño, the shift, by itself, seems insufficient
    to account for what’s going on. Meanwhile, the margin by which records are being
    shattered exceeds what’s usually seen during El Niños.

    a hurricane researcher at the University of Miami, said. “It’s like the whole
    climate just fast-forwarded by fifty or a hundred years. That’s how strange this
    looks.” It’s estimated that in 2023 the heat content in the upper two thousand
    metres of the oceans increased by at least nine zettajoules. For comparison’s
    sake, the world’s annual energy consumption amounts to about 0.6 zettajoules.

    to the past year’s anomalous warmth. One is the January, 2022, eruption of an
    underwater volcano in the South Pacific called Hunga Tonga–Hunga Ha‘apai. Usually,
    volcanoes emit sulfur dioxide, which produces a temporary cooling effect, and
    water vapor, which does the opposite. Hunga Tonga–Hunga Ha‘apai produced relatively
    little sulfur dioxide but a fantastic amount of water vapor, and its warming effects,
    it’s believed, are still being felt.

    is ramping up—it’s expected to peak this year or next—and this, too, may be producing
    an extra bit of warming.

    went into effect in 2020 reduced the amount of sulfur in the fuel used by supertankers.
    This reduction, in turn, has led to a decline in a type of air pollution that,
    through direct and indirect effects, reflects sunlight back to space. It’s thought
    that this change has led to an increase in the amount of energy being absorbed
    by the seas, though quantifying the effect is difficult.

    say it’s possible. There’s also a lot of noise in the climate system. “This could
    end up just being natural variability,” Susan Wijffels, a senior scientist at
    the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, said.

    yet accounted for. This spring, *ENSO* is expected to transition into what scientists
    call “neutral” conditions. If precedent holds, then when this occurs ocean temperatures
    should start to run more in line with long-term trends.

    said. “If temperatures remain very high, then I would say more people in the community
    will be really alarmed and say ‘O.K., this is outside of what we can explain.’ ”

    the oceans, many countries experienced record-breaking heat waves or record-breaking
    wildfires or record-breaking rainstorms or some combination of these. (Last year,
    in the United States, there were twenty-eight weather-related disasters that caused
    more than a billion dollars’ worth of damage—another record.) If the climate projections
    are accurate, then the year was a preview of things to come, which is scary enough.
    But, if the projections are missing something, that’s potentially even more terrifying,
    though scientists tend to use more measured terms.

    how the system responds,” Schmidt observed. “All of these statistics that we’re
    talking about, they’re taken from the prior data. But nothing in the prior data
    looked like 2023\. Does that mean that the prior data are no longer predictive
    because the system has changed? I can’t rule that out, and that would obviously
    be very concerning.” ♦
