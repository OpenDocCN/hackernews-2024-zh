    per week, times of day, technologies, degree of multi-tasking, etc…and how you
    choose what to listen to at any given moment. I’d be interested.

    written about [satellite radio](https://marginalrevolution.com/?s=satellite+radio). 
    As for home, I like to listen to music most of the time, noting that if I am writing
    a) the music doesn’t bother me, and b) I don’t necessarily hear that much of the
    music.  A few more specific points:'

    see a good jazz concert live.  Having already spent a lot of time with the great
    classics, at current margins I am disillusioned with most “jazz as recorded music.”

- en: 4b. The same is true of most “world music,” if you will excuse the poorly chosen
    label.  I do subscribe to [Songlines](https://www.songlines.co.uk/), a world music
    magazine.  I buy some of the recommendations on CD, but try out many more on YouTube
    or Spotify.  That is my primary use of those services, at least for music.  That
    is one case where I am sampling to see if I run across new sounds.

- en: 7\. For a classical piece I really like, I might own five or more recorded versions,
    occasionally running up to a dozen.  Listening to a poor or even so-so recording
    of a very good piece is to me painful and to be avoided.

- en: 8\. Contemporary classical music — which many people hate — gets plenty of listening
    time.  Though not when Natasha is home.  Some of those recordings, such as Helmut
    Lachenmann string quartets, seem to create problems for Spinoza, noting that he
    is rarely not at home.  Perhaps they will be shelved for a few years.

- en: 9\. I buy new classical music releases recommended by [Fanfare](https://marginalrevolution.com/?s=fanfare),
    and occasionally from the NYT or Gramophone or elsewhere.  As for “popular music”
    (a bad term), mostly I wait until December and then buy CDs extensively from various
    “best of the year” lists.  I do some Spotify sampling then too, again from those
    lists.

    shelf upstairs for what I am listening to actively at the moment.  That shelf
    might have 200 or so CDs, with some of them scattered on tables, and with some
    LPs nearby as well.

- en: 11\. Periodically I go down into the basement and choose which discs will be
    “re-promoted” to the active shelf upstairs.  And if I am done listening to a disc,
    it goes down to the basement, with some chance of being re-promoted back to upstairs
    later.

- en: 12\. If I don’t like a disc, I throw it out, as space constraints have become
    too binding.  (It is cruel to give it away, and no one wants it anyway.)  As time
    passes, I am throwing out more discs.  For instance, I love Cuban music but I
    don’t lilsten to it on disc any more.

- en: Overall, I view this system as optimized for getting to know a core repertoire. 
    It is not optimized for browsing or random discovery.  I feel I have a lot of
    discovery in my musical life, but it comes from reading and information inflow
    — both extensive — not from *listening* per se.
