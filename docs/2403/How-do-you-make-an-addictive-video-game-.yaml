    work on are the ones where, afterwards, some sliver of the world looks a little
    different to me, and this was one.

    behind Hearthstone and Marvel Snap, about how a creative person learns to make
    the things they love, and about the secret ideas hiding in games as simple as
    rock-papers-scissors.

    video games … [Balatro has come up,](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2379780/Balatro/)
    which looks pretty fascinating. A very strange version of poker which lets you
    play “illegal poker hands” and encourages you to cheat.

    *[Slay the Spire](https://store.steampowered.com/app/646570/Slay_the_Spire/)*
    which I’ve avoided because its reputation is that it’s so addictive I’m genuinely
    worried it’ll impinge on my ability to focus on this job I love so much.'

    is a strange and very enjoyable game. It has charming, original Nintendo-style
    graphics.

    I’ll actually enjoy it. The same way sometimes restaurants with sub-par ambience
    actually have very good food.

    by Max Read, which I referenced in the introduction. Max also has a Substack I
    follow [called “Read Max,”](https://maxread.substack.com/) it’s a mix of writing
    about tech and culture recommendations.
