    so-called "doomsday" Thwaites Glacier from melting.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The largest glacier on Earth is nicknamed the "doomsday" glacier because it
    would drastically drive up sea levels around the world if it melted entirely,
    though this would take hundreds of years.

    of all global sea-level rise, according to a 2020 study in Nature Geoscience.

    that has divided scientists.
  prefs: []

    nibbled away by warm water beneath it, as it floats on the sea surface.

    the costs of protecting global coastlines if the ice collapses: about $40b per
    year, per metre of sea level rise, and of relocating people who would lose their
    homes or jobs.'
