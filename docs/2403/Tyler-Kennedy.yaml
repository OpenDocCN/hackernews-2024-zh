    URL is? URLs have evolved drastically since they were originally defined in [1994](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1738).
    The [WHATWG](https://whatwg.org/) has a [URL specification](https://url.spec.whatwg.org/)
    that is comprehensive and has helped standardize the behavior of URLs across browsers,
    but this specification still isn''t universal and ambiguities like "how many slashes
    are you allowed" can definitely get on [your nerves](https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2017/01/30/one-url-standard-please):'

- en: So browsers accept URLs written with thousands of forward slashes instead of
    two. That is not a good reason for the spec to say that a URL may legitimately
    contain a thousand slashes. I’m totally convinced there’s no critical content
    anywhere using such formatted URLs and no soul will be sad if we’d restricted
    the number to a single-digit. So we should. And yeah, then browsers should reject
    URLs using more.

    module should conform with it. The urlparse module is currently not entirely compliant
    with this RFC due to defacto scenarios for parsing, and for backward compatibility
    purposes, some parsing quirks from older RFCs are retained. The testcases in test_urlparse.py
    provides a good indicator of parsing behavior.

    parsing 7 URLs for every 1 parsed by cURL. Written in C++, it now has bindings

- en: The ada-python binding is perfectly functional, and the official binding for
    the project. However, the ada-python bindings are built on [CFFI](https://cffi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/),
    an approach that has the binding between C and Python written in Python itself,
    which loses some of the performance benefits of using Ada in the first place when
    most of the time is spent just making the function call.

    at the ada-python bindings and out of that was born [can_ada](https://github.com/tktech/can_ada),
    a new Python binding that uses [pybind11](https://pybind11.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
    and template magic to generate the binding code, which is then compiled into a
    Python extension module. This approach has the potential to be much faster than
    the ada-python bindings, and indeed when comparing the two bindings, the new can_ada
    binding is about 2x faster than the ada-python bindings which in turn is about
    2x faster than `urllib.parse`!'
