- en: This is the easy one. The Computer Fraud and Abuse Act provides civil and criminal
    penalties when you "intentionally cause damage without authorization" to your
    employer's computers. This includes the unauthorized destruction of data, even
    if you're the one who put that data there in the first place, and even if your
    employer doesn't know about it right now. Once the data is on your employer's
    computer and being used for any length of time, then it becomes their data.

- en: The definition of damage is subjective, but if you know that your employer depends
    on your data, and that deleting it would negatively impact their operations, then
    deletion probably means damage in this case.
  prefs: []

- en: None of this means that your employer owns your software, just that they own
    the data on their devices. If you felt that your employer improperly has copies
    of your software, then you need to go through proper channels to have it removed.

    If you own the copyright to your software, then your employer probably needs your
    permission to use it. If your employer owns the copyright, then they can do whatever
    they want with it, and in fact, you would need your employer's permission to continue
    using the software.

- en: 'In general, copyright belongs to the author, except in the case of a "work
    for hire." The work for hire doctrine states that an employer owns the copyright
    of anything an employee makes within the "scope of employment" for that employee.
    An easy example would be a software developer: developers are explicitly hired
    to develop software, so any software they create that is even tangentially related
    to their employer automatically becomes the property of their employer. There
    is no clear line, but the courts have found many factors that influence whether
    or not something is within the scope of your employment:'

    If you're hired to move boxes in a warehouse, software development is not related
    to that job.

- en: b. Where and how was the work created. Did you create the software on a company
    computer, while you were on the clock, or while you were in your company workspace?
    If so, then your employer has a strong claim of ownership.

    software development platforms, and it can be as simple as clicking a button or
    even may be included automatically. If you already distributed your software under
    license, you typically can't revoke an existing license easily.

    your contract may grant your employer a license to use it.

    you may have granted your employer an implied license by your actions. If you
    are the one who put the software on the employer's computer and shared it with
    curious coworkers when they asked about it, you have implicitly given them permission
    to use the software.

    IP can be messy at the best of times, and in cases like this without a clear contract
    up front things only get worse. If it turns out you don't own the copyright to
    your software, take it as a hard-learned life lesson and know better next time.

- en: One potential thing you could do is to show your software to the higher ups
    in the company and explain yourself. If you can show how your software makes the
    warehouse more efficient, you can make a business case about the value of the
    software. If you save the company 10 hours a week of warehouse labor, that might
    be $150 a week or $7,800 a year. Maybe they're looking for someone to help streamline
    their warehouse operations and would hire you into a different role. Or, you could
    say that you're willing to sign a contract that unambiguously assigns the ownership
    of the software to the company for a reasonable sum of $2,000 or $5,000 or whatever
    number you think makes sense and see if they bite.

- en: You haven't described the scope or function of your software, but beware that
    most hobbyist projects are not actually that valuable, if at all. Maybe you've
    struck gold, but probably not. Unless there's some "secret sauce" that's especially
    hard to comprehend, it's likely that your employer could hire a developer on contract
    for a few weeks or a few months to build a similar application if they really
    wanted their own copy. But, a developer on contract might be $10,000-$20,000 a
    month or more depending on location and skill, so your goal would be to seem like
    a bargain compared to that while still adding value to the company.
