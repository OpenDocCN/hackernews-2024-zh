    is raw and plaintive, dipping into blue notes. A lone acoustic guitar chugs behind
    it, punctuating the vocal phrases with tasteful runs. But there’s no human behind
    the voice, no hands on that guitar. There is, in fact, no guitar. In the space
    of 15 seconds, this credible, even moving, blues song was generated by the latest
    AI model from a startup named Suno. All it took to summon it from the void was
    a simple text prompt: “solo acoustic Mississippi Delta blues about a sad AI.”
    To be maximally precise, the song is the work of two AI models in collaboration:
    Suno’s [model](https://www.suno.ai/) creates all the music itself, while calling
    on OpenAI’s ChatGPT to generate the lyrics and even a title: “Soul of the Machine.”'

    room in Suno’s temporary headquarters, steps away from the Harvard campus in Cambridge,
    Massachusetts, even some of the people behind the technology are ever-so-slightly
    unnerved. There’s some nervous laughter, alongside murmurs of “Holy shit” and
    “Oh, boy.” It’s mid-February, and we’re playing with their new model, V3, which
    is still a couple of weeks from public release. In this case, it took only three
    tries to get that startling result. The first two were decent, but a simple tweak

    credible text, images (via services like Midjourney), and even video, particularly
    with OpenAI’s new Sora tool. But audio, and music in particular, has lagged. Suno
    appears to be cracking the code to [AI music](https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/ai-music-drake-weeknd-ghostwriter977-beatles-elvis-voice-1234770094/),

    democratized music making. The most vocal of the co-founders, Mikey Shulman, a
    boyishly charming, backpack-toting 37-year-old with a Harvard Ph.D. in physics,
    envisions a billion people worldwide paying 10 bucks a month to create songs with

    most powerful and unsettling AI creation I’ve encountered in any medium. Its very

    few weeks after returning from Cambridge, I send the song off to Living Colour
    guitarist Vernon Reid, who’s been outspoken about the perils and possibilities

    Though they always intended to end up with a music product, their earliest brainstorming
    included an idea for a hearing aid and even the possibility of finding malfunctioning
    machinery through audio analysis. Instead, their first release was a text-to-speech
    program called Bark. When they surveyed early Bark users, it became clear that

- en: Suno uses the same general approach as large language models like ChatGPT, which
    break down human language into discrete segments known as tokens, absorb its millions
    of usages, styles, and structures, and then reconstruct it on demand. But audio,
    particularly music, is almost unfathomably more complex, which is why, just last
    year, AI-music experts [told](https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/ai-music-drake-weeknd-ghostwriter977-beatles-elvis-voice-1234770094/)
    *Rolling Stone* that a service as capable as Suno’s might take years to arrive. 
    “Audio is not a discrete thing like words,” Shulman says. “It’s a wave. It’s a
    continuous signal.” High-quality audio’s sampling rate is generally 44khz or 48hz,
    which means “48,000 tokens a second,” he adds. “That’s a big problem, right? And
    so you need to figure out how to kind of smoosh that down to something more reasonable.”
    How, though? “A lot of work, a lot of heuristics, a lot of other kinds of tricks
    and models and stuff like that. I don’t think we’re anywhere close to done.” Eventually,
    Suno wants to find alternatives to the text-to-music interface, adding more advanced
    and intuitive inputs — generating songs based on users’ own singing is one idea.

    高质量音频的采样率通常为44khz或48hz，这意味着“每秒48,000个令牌”，他补充道。“这是一个很大的问题，对吧？所以你需要想办法把它压缩成更合理的东西。”
    不过，怎么做呢？“大量的工作，大量的启发式方法，大量的其他技巧和模型等等。我认为我们还远远没有完成。” 最终，Suno希望找到替代文本到音乐界面的方法，增加更先进和直观的输入方式

    much more into music, much more focused on creating, developing much more distinct
