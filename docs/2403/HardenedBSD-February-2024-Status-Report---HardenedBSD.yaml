- en: I spent most of February getting 15-CURRENT working again. FreeBSD introduced
    a new library, libsys, which is where the userland side of performing syscalls
    is implemented. There's an intricate dance between libsys, libc, libthr, and the
    CSU. I spent some time learning about that dance, and I still feel like there's
    more to learn.

- en: HardenedBSD 15-CURRENT is mostly fixed. Prior to the libsys change, we built
    libc with Link-Time Optimizations (LTO). Building libc with LTO was part of the
    problem, though not the only issue. Once all the issues are resolved, I will re-enable
    LTO for libc.

- en: FreeBSD also introduced a new pam_xdg(8) PAM module. This module had a few vulnerabilities,
    which are fixed in HardenedBSD. The two NULL deref bugs are fixed in FreeBSD now,
    too. The filesystem race condition and recursion limit issues are somewhat mitigated
    in HardenedBSD, but not completely.

- en: HardenedBSD now has two VisionFive StarFive2 64-bit RISCV SBCs. I spent a little
    bit of time toying around with them. The kernel boots to the mountroot prompt.
    I've been wanting to learn hardware hacking, including writing drivers, so these
    little SBCs might be great for that.
