    the back seat when she felt the urge to use the bathroom. Usually, Gedo would
    find the nearest gas station, mall, or restaurant — if she was lucky, they would
    let her use their facilities. But when she stopped at a gas station, the toilet
    was locked. Her customer was getting impatient, so Gedo got back into the car
    and kept driving.

    work 10 to 12 hours a day to make ends meet. As they traverse their cities, these
    workers scramble to find facilities to meet their basic needs — restrooms, clean
    places to eat meals, and safe spots to rest. Through trial and error, many gig
    workers have crafted their own invisible city maps, identifying places where they
    can stop for a breather.
