    the back seat when she felt the urge to use the bathroom. Usually, Gedo would
    find the nearest gas station, mall, or restaurant — if she was lucky, they would
    let her use their facilities. But when she stopped at a gas station, the toilet
    was locked. Her customer was getting impatient, so Gedo got back into the car
    and kept driving.

    work 10 to 12 hours a day to make ends meet. As they traverse their cities, these
    workers scramble to find facilities to meet their basic needs — restrooms, clean
    places to eat meals, and safe spots to rest. Through trial and error, many gig
    workers have crafted their own invisible city maps, identifying places where they
