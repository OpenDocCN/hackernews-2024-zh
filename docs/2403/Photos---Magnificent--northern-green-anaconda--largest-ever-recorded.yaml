    earlier this month. "One female anaconda we encountered measured an astounding
    6.3 meters (20.8 feet) long."

    The Amazon has two separate basins. The larger basin in the south is home to the
    green anaconda from which the northern green anaconda comes. The smaller basin
    in the north is home to the newly discovered northern green anaconda.

    – to put it in perspective, humans differ from chimpanzees by only about 2%."

    reports from the Huaorani people of other anacondas in the area "measuring more
    than 7.5 meters long (24.6 feet) and weighing around 500 kilograms (1,102 pounds),"
    Fry shared.
