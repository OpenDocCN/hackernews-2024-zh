    prohibiting the manufacture and sale of cultivated, or “lab-grown,” meat in Florida.
    Governor DeSantis is expected to sign the bill, and when he does, Florida will
    become the first state to ban cultivated meat, which is made by replicating the
    cells of real meat without the need to actually raise and slaughter the animal.

    are considering similar bans. But what is the fight over cultivated meat really
    about? Is it economics, with one industry lobbying for protection from another?
    Is it the culture war, pitting red-blooded, carnivorous Americans against effete
    cosmopolitan environmentalists? Or is this truly a question of safety, as the
    state government, apparently in conflict with the FDA, has argued?

    $10K to another PAC in 2021 to conduct a fundraiser for the president of the Florida
    Senate. Since 2017, it has contributed $75,000 to Ron DeSantis, more than any
    other candidate, and has spent $72,000 on the Florida Republican Senatorial Campaign
    Committee during the same period. It has also maxed out campaign donations to
    Agriculture Commissioner Wilton Simpson and several state legislators who were
    instrumental in pushing the cultivated meat ban, including Danny Alvarez, Clay
    Yarborough, and Tyler Sirois.

    much to fear from cultivated meat, at least for the foreseeable future. “Cultivated
    meat is still very early on in its development, and it will take many years to
    scale up production.” He pointed out that [demand for meat](https://www.fao.org/3/cb5332en/Meat.pdf)
    was increasing all over the world, even as supply [decreased](https://www.meatpoultry.com/articles/29604-2024-industry-outlook-beef-dealing-with-two-year-decline)

    meat is an interesting one. There’s no federal law or final regulation that specifically
    addresses cultivated meat, and the current regulatory process itself is operating
    in a novel, ad hoc fashion. For example, the regulation of beef and chicken (the
    two proteins the cultivated meat industry is most interested in) is normally carried
    out solely under the auspices of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA).
    However, cultivated meat is currently being regulated [primarily by the FDA](https://time.com/6238727/usda-approves-cultivated-chicken-for-sale/),
    with the USDA coming in only at the harvesting process to ensure proper labeling
    and sanitation requirements are met.

    [Upside Foods](https://upsidefoods.com/), serve as something of a road map, but
    that the FDA has noted that the previous cases are not meant to serve as final
    guidance.

    reassuring, but setting regulations in stone for a nascent technology also seems
    unwise. One could take the FDA’s “moving target” as evidence that “our institutions
    are not prepared” for cultivated meat, as Rep. Black thinks, or evidence that
    our institutions are evolving along with it. So either the FDA is doing exactly
    what Florida legislators want it to do, or it’s not prepared to do anything at
    all, depending on your stance on cultivated meat.

    than it used to be, particularly online, and particularly after Covid, as is distrust

    deserved or not, is its place in the fight over climate change. Whether or not
    cultivated meat is less carbon-intensive than traditional meat is contingent on
    several factors, such as the type of energy being used to power the facility and
    the type of meat being replaced. One study even suggested that cultivated meat
    might be [25 times worse](https://www.newscientist.com/article/2372229-lab-grown-meat-could-be-25-times-worse-for-the-climate-than-beef/)
    for the climate. (Companies like SciFi Foods claim that their products are more
    sustainable than traditionally cultivated meat using studies they’ve personally
    commissioned.) Governor DeSantis seemed to channel this line of thinking, that
    agriculture is unfairly being demonized—see the [endless war on cow flatulence](https://www.reuters.com/breakingviews/war-cow-farts-is-stinky-necessary-job-2023-03-24/)—while

    that’s more of a goofy marketing racket rather than a burger-snatching New World

    meat is part of an effort to replace traditional meat with Frankenfood at the
    behest of godless, sanctimonious elites who obsess over climate change because
    they, unlike regular Americans, don’t have any real problems. I think that this
    was the real driving force behind Florida’s meat ban, with the health concerns
