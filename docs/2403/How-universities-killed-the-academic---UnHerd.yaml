    and the pointed introduction of absurdity, but it is hard to see how modern university
    life could be further embellished in these respects. As usual, there were some
    classic stories served up this week for civilians to laugh at.

    we read that policies at Glasgow University and Imperial College London now direct
    staff and students to avoid the phrase “the most qualified person should get the
    job” because this counts as a microaggression. Over in the US, yet another professor
    resplendent in beadwork and buckskin has [admitted](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2024/03/04/a-professor-claimed-to-be-native-american-did-she-know-she-wasnt)
    to falsely claiming possession of Native American ancestry. And an article just
    out in the [*Applied Linguistics Review*](https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/applirev-2024-0014/html)
    provides a brand new excuse to lazy researchers: the requirement of a literature
    review in some disciplines imposes “particular configurations of privileged knowledge”
    amounting to an “enactment of symbolic violence”. Or, at least, that’s what students
    will be telling linguistics lecturers from now on.'

- en: The organisation that first uncovered the story about microaggressions is the
    [Committee for Academic Freedom](https://afcomm.org.uk/), newly formed by philosophy
    lecturer Edward Skidelsky to push back against institutional incursions on free
    inquiry. During drinks at the committee’s launch, where I was a guest speaker,
    more astonishing tales were aired. I heard of endocrinologists at one Russell
    Group institution being forced to disavow binary theories of biological sex; of
    male trans-identified dance students at a prestigious arts establishment insisting
    they be allowed to perform lead ballerina roles and be hoisted aloft during lifts;
    and of a reading list in one department with pronouns added for every cited author,
    including those of Osama Bin Laden (“He/Him”, in case you’re wondering). As I
    mingled, I added each new tale to my mental inventory of university batshittery,
    already creaking at the seams.

- en: But while the general public increasingly gets the joke, and a growing band
    of disgruntled renegades joins organisations like CAF, it is still true that most
    employees within relevant institutions remain po-faced and acquiescent in the
    light of blatantly stupid initiatives by their managers and colleagues. Partly
    this is because they are frightened to do otherwise, as new research also [published](https://afcomm.org.uk/2024/02/22/caf-survey-reveals-climate-of-oppression-and-fear-in-uk-universities/)
    this week by CAF suggests. But partly, perhaps, it’s because nearly all of the
    personality types who might in the past have viciously mocked, scathingly critiqued,
    or otherwise put up an intellectual fight have been weeded out of the system.
