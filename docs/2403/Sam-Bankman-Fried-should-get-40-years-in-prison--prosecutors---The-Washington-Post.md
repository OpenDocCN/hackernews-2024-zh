Federal prosecutors urged a New York judge to sentence Sam Bankman-Fried to 40 to 50 years in prison because of the “extraordinary dimensions” of the disgraced cryptocurrency mogul’s multibillion-dollar fraud.

In a more than 100-page filing on Friday, prosecutors methodically laid out [Bankman-Fried’s crimes](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2023/11/02/sbf-bankman-fried-trial-ftx/?itid=lk_inline_manual_4) — wire fraud, conspiracy to commit fraud and conspiracy to commit money laundering — in connection with his oversight of FTX, the cryptocurrency exchange he founded. Authorities estimated he defrauded at least 1 million victims of more than $8 billion — making it one of the largest financial frauds in history — and have asked that he be ordered to pay $11 billion in restitution when he is sentenced March 28 in U.S. District Court in Manhattan.
