    at being lucky. They don‚Äôt try that hard and nice things just keep coming: they

    people miss chance opportunities when they‚Äôre *too focused on looking for something
    else*.

    helps them to notice the little opportunities gleaning on the periphery of their
    vision. (Literally or figuratively.)
