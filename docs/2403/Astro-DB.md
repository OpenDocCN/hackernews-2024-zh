# Astro DB

> 来源：[https://astro.build/db/](https://astro.build/db/)

Astro DB brings together the web framework, the schema, the seed file, and the database itself all into a single cohesive story. We even include an ORM for you: Drizzle. We selected Drizzle because it is a type-safe ORM that lets you get as close to the metal as you want, and is also pluggable which allowed us to add our own behavior on top.

Astro DB includes a hosted libSQL database that you can connect to during local development and in production. Everything is managed for you through our Astro Studio platform. You can create a new database for your project in less than 30 seconds.
