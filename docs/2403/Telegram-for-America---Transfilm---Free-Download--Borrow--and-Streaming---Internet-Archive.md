Fascinating!

This was a thrilling piece of history. I was glued to the screen.

As an Amateur Radio Operator I enjoyed seeing how the
technology has changed since then.

The one shocking point was that in 1956 there were 150,000,000
people in the USA. Now, 60 years later, that number has more than
doubled to 320,000,000\. **Reviewer:** [Ron Raygun](https://archive.org/details/%40ron_raygun)

When America was Leader

A well produced film Samuel F.B. Morse's invention made America a distinct leader when his development became the International Morse Code. And Western Union took that to new heights in the '30's through the '60's. The film predates Westar by about 20 years, and that is probably good, as the company started to lose insight, and began to lose money. If they could have retained cutting-edge top management, they could be near or at the top of the telecom industry today. But of course, when Lee Iaccoca says; "Where have all the Leaders Gone", Technology always wins. **Reviewer:** [lostnyc](https://archive.org/details/%40lostnyc)

Good film

I think this was an interesting film.

I believe the previous reviewer was right, at about

[13:02](/details/Telegram1956?start=782)

into the film there's a structure fire and it does look like someone jumped off a higher floor, difficult to tell for certain but going frame by frame does show what appears to be someone jumping from that burning building. **Reviewer:** [Spuzz](https://archive.org/details/%40spuzz)

"Someone has jumped from the window!"

A fun overview of a service that doesn't exist anymore! This film is all about Western Union. Yes boys and girls, before you cou;d get your money in an instant using their service (well, a couple of hours) WU was your telegraph service. You want a crane? Telegraph it! You want to report news of your wife's birth! By gum, Western Union was the only way! This film details of the many different telegraph services available, and how it gets from one place to another. You can have a private telegraph service if you want to! (Well, you have to be like a bank). Also, again, this film gets into facsimile service, something of which I never knew existed in the 1950's. Very odd to be proven wrong on this one. (Well, it's just very odd to be proven wrong period). Also, the film briefly talks about sending the news by wire, and shows some storms, sports scenes and fires. Watch one of the fire scenes very carefully. Is someone jumping out of a building to their deaths? The camera follows something down, I am not too sure what it is, if it is what I think it is, then wow.
