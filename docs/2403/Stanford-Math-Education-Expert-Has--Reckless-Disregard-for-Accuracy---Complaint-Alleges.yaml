- en: Jo Boaler, a Stanford University professor and one of the country’s most influential
    experts on math education, has misrepresented scholars’ findings in her work to
    the point of showing a “reckless disregard for accuracy,” according to an anonymous
    complaint reportedly filed with Stanford on Wednesday.

- en: The 100-page [document](https://drive.proton.me/urls/P7BYBG7E6R#VCfOpReAcH9F)
    details 52 instances in which Boaler, a professor of math education at the university’s
    Graduate School of Education, allegedly misstated or misconstrued outside studies
    about learning, neuroscience, and math education in her own articles, lectures,
    and books. Several of its examples appeared in a draft of the California math
    framework, a guidance document Boaler co-authored about how math should be taught
    in K-12 schools.

    which first reported on the document, the complaint was sent to Stanford’s provost
    and dean of research and alleges that Boaler is in violation of Stanford’s research
    policies. A research-policy handbook [states](https://doresearch.stanford.edu/policies/research-policy-handbook/conduct-research/research-misconduct-policy-allegations-investigations-and-reporting)
    that the university has in the past interpreted “reckless disregard for accuracy”
    as a “misdeed.”A Stanford spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request
    for confirmation that the university had received the complaint.

    for review, and, as such, it would not be prudent to comment on an eventuality,”
    Ian McCaleb, a spokesman for Boaler, said in a written statement. “Nonetheless,
    Dr. Boaler is confident in the integrity and expansiveness of the research that
    backs her work.”

- en: Boaler has drawn praise from many educators for advocating for math instruction
    that, broadly, emphasizes real-world applications, de-emphasizes memorization,
    and aims to reduce gender and racial disparities. It is a vision she’s laid out
    in popular books like *Mathematical Mindsets*and *Limitless Mind*, and through
    Youcubed, a Stanford research center that she co-founded to provide free teaching
    resources. *Education Week* recently named her one of the country’s [most influential
    scholars](https://www.edweek.org/policy-politics/opinion-2024-rhsu-edu-scholar-public-influence-top-10-lists/2024/01).

- en: The complaint reportedly filed on Wednesday lands as Boaler has drawn criticism
    for how her stances have affected math education in California and across the
    nation. For example, she [praised](https://hechingerreport.org/opinion-how-one-city-got-math-right/)
    San Francisco schools for adopting a policy of not teaching algebra during middle
    school. A decade later, the district is undoing that policy, following research
    showing that it [did not reduce racial disparities as hoped](https://www.edweek.org/teaching-learning/san-francisco-insisted-on-algebra-in-9th-grade-did-it-improve-equity/2023/03).

    which bills itself as making math engaging and practical for high-schoolers, was
    until recently considered by the University of California to be an acceptable
    substitute for a required year of advanced algebra — a stance criticized by STEM
    professors and professionals, since the course teaches little advanced algebra.
    That approval has since been [rescinded by a UC governance panel](https://www.chronicle.com/article/the-university-of-california-is-reversing-course-on-its-data-science-admissions-standard),
    a decision confirmed by [a faculty workgroup](https://senate.universityofcalifornia.edu/_files/committees/boars/documents/boarsacwphase1report-20240221.pdf).'

- en: The complaint details how many “references that Dr. Boaler cites to support
    claims in her work do not actually support her claims,” and argues that some of
    the discrepancies are especially consequential because they were cited at one
    point by the California math framework. (It does note, however, that many of the
    alleged misrepresentations were later removed in the final framework.) The complaint
    cites instances in which experts disagreed with how Boaler had described studies
    in their fields or conducted by them personally. Some of those examples were taken
    from [a 2023 *Chronicle* profile of Boaler](https://www.chronicle.com/article/the-divider).
    The document also cites concerns raised by Brian Conrad, a Stanford mathematician
    who documented [allegedly misrepresented citations](https://drive.google.com/file/d/17O123ENTxvZOjXTnOMNRDtHQAOjtb2Zo/view)
    in an earlier version of the California math framework. Conrad declined to comment
    for this story.

- en: For example, Boaler’s book *Limitless Mind* claims that according to [a 2013
    study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3797151/), “different areas
    of the brain were involved when people worked with symbols, such as numbers, than
    when they worked with visual and spatial information, such as an array of dots,”
    and that “mathematics learning and performance were optimized when these two areas
    of the brain were communicating with each other.” An earlier version of the California
    math framework cited the 2013 study in nearly identical language. But one of the
    researchers told [*The Chronicle*](https://www.chronicle.com/article/the-divider)
    last year that the study had done no brain imaging, so “it’s simply wrong to make
    any neural claims from that paper.” (At the time, Boaler defended her interpretation
    of the study.)

- en: In another example cited by the complaint, Boaler has cited a study as showing
    that timed tests cause students to experience stress. An earlier version of the
    California math framework also cited the study to say that “such tests have been
    found to prompt math anxiety.” However, Conrad — [and the author](https://twitter.com/minilek/status/1729292275082309857?s=20)
    — noted that [the study](https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/document?repid=rep1&type=pdf&doi=a0a12828e99e90d56fc9e03b8bc7d9023e26f442)
    is not about math anxiety or timed tests, so it “must be removed” from the framework,
    Conrad has written.
