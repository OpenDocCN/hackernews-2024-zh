- en: Microcontrollers are not computers — except they *kind of* are. They have processors,
    memory, and some form of storage. Though there are some limitations and a lot
    of architectural differences, microcontrollers can act as computers. But because
    they have a lot less power under the hood than modern computers, they can usually
    only mimic older computers and video game consoles. That was, however, enough
    for Scott Porter (AKA Smashcat) to [create their own game engine for the Arduino
    Uno that can run](https://github.com/Smashcat/UNO_Manic_Miner) *[Manic Miner](https://github.com/Smashcat/UNO_Manic_Miner)*
    — a video game originally released for the ZX Spectrum.

- en: '*Manic Miner* was a big hit and is easily one of the best games to come out
    of the 1980s for *any* system. Though Matthew Smith wrote the game for the ZX
    Spectrum, it was soon ported to many other 8-bit computers and then to just about
    every other system that came later. It is a platfomer with rudimentary graphics,
    but with many creative and challenging levels. Porter built a video game engine
    for the Arduino Uno Rev3 and decided that *Manic Miner* would be the perfect title
    to showcase its capability.'

- en: This game engine has capabilities similar to early 8-bit computers, with some
    restrictions imposed by the low RAM and lack of a dedicated video chip. The latter
    factor meant that Porter had to make the Arduino generate a composite video signal.
    That requires very accurate timing, so they recommend using an official Uno Rev3
    with a real crystal instead of a generic board that may have a resonator instead.

- en: It is capable of producing monochrome graphics with a resolution of 256×256
    at a fixed framerate of 50fps. Up to nine sprites can appear onscreen at a time,
    each with a 16×16 resolution. One of those sprites can have pixel-perfect collision
    detection against all of the others. The game engine can display scrolling tile
    map backgrounds and Porter reports that it has plenty of cycles to spare for the
    game logic.

- en: A custom PCB shield helps with connections, providing the video output, a speaker
    driver, and control buttons. There is also an NES controller port for people that
    would prefer to use that over the built-in buttons.

- en: Porter's ported version of *Manic Miner* looks great. It has all 20 original
    levels, plus all of the special bosses and mechanics. The high score is even persistent
    between boots and there is two-channel audio. We did observe a few glitches in
    the demonstration video, but the game looks entirely playable.
