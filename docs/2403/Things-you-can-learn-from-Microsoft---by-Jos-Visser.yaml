    not a roaring success. I was at Google at the time and my younger colleagues were
    making a lot of fun about its lack of accuracy and overall poor search quality.
    Jokes about Bing not being able to find itself were rife, because if you asked
    Bing for a search engine, its top result was a link to Google üôÇ. The general mood
    was that we were amazing and that Microsoft‚Äôs time was truly over.

    my colleagues that you *always* have to be afraid of Microsoft because the list
    of companies that dominated their respective spaces and that were taken out completely
    by Microsoft is very long and includes once famous names like [WordPerfect](http://www.wordplace.com/ap/),
    [Lotus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lotus_Software), [Borland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borland),

    from humble beginnings as the creator of a [Basic interpreter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altair_BASIC)
    for the Altair 8800 microcomputer (a fascinating story in itself), Microsoft had
    become a behemoth with a product portfolio that spanned operating systems, programming
    languages, office productivity software, games, and even a very decent [flight
    simulator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Microsoft_Flight_Simulator).
    Having overtaken IBM as the leading provider of software for the business environment,
    Microsoft was firmly committed to its principle of ‚Äúdesktop hegemony at all cost‚Äù.
    Consequently, it defended its interests with a lot of fervor.

    ‚Äú[Bill] Gates expressed frustration with most computer hobbyists who were using
    his company's Altair BASIC software without having paid for it. He asserted that
    such widespread unauthorized copying in effect discouraged developers from investing
    time and money in creating high-quality software. He cited the unfairness of gaining
    the benefits of software authors' time, effort, and capital without paying them
    as a rationale for refusing to publish the machine code for his company's flagship
    product, thereby making it available to lower-income hobbyists who could have
    borrowed such program listings from their local library and entered the program
    into their hobby computer by data entry.‚Äù

    was the enemy to beat. I myself swore off all Microsoft software and started an
    experiment on [Living Without Windows](https://www.josvisser.nl/lww/). This brace
    choice led to a variety of problems for which I had to find creative solutions.

    Notes. At the time there was no Lotus Notes client for Linux so I did all my work
    email using my Internet email address ([josv@osp.nl](mailto:josv@osp.nl)). After
    a while I received some complaints that this exposed bank documents to the Internet
    and that this was a security problem. In response I found a TLD where the bank
    had not registered their brand name domain, registered it, and configured my mail
    setup to send and receive mail from [josv@thebank.tld](mailto:josv@thebank.tld),
    quieting the critical voices.

    I am not sure how many of you remember it, but let‚Äôs say it wasn‚Äôt great and consequently
    it was not very successful. But, they persevered and created [Windows 2.0](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_2.0).
    Still not great. Then they created [Windows 2.1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_2.1)
    (a.k.a. Windows 286 and Windows 386) which used some of the ‚Äúadvanced‚Äù features
    of more modern CPUs (like memory protection and virtual memory). Still not awesome,

    in the early 1990s Microsoft, which started its life as a Basic vendor, had pretty
    much ceded the Basic market to Borland‚Äôs [Turbo Basic](https://winworldpc.com/product/turbo-basic/1x).
    Microsoft‚Äôs Basic interpreters were so far behind that it was *almost* inconceivable
    that they would catch up. Almost. Microsoft decided to turn the table on them
    and commissioned **two** parallel projects to close the gap. The first project
    needed to make improvements to their current offering to make sure that it stayed
    vaguely competitive. The second project needed to come up with a completely new
    product that was going to capture the market. The first group of people did whatever
    needed to be done (by the way: Sucks to be in that team) whereas the second group
    created [Visual Basic](https://winworldpc.com/product/microsoft-visual-bas/30),
    changing software development on Windows forever.'

    leveraged IT professionals in the market. In the days before the Internet, you
    could take out a subscription with Microsoft [Tech Net](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_TechNet)
    and/or Microsoft [Developer Net](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/) which
    would give you unparalleled access to almost all Microsoft software and tools.
    I had these two subscriptions and throughout the year I would get heaps and heaps
    of mail from Microsoft with CDs containing every version of almost every Microsoft
    software product in every language imaginable. If I wanted to test my code on
    an Arabic Windows NT 3.51 while talking to an Italian SQL Server, no problem,
    I had the software! These CDs also contained books, manuals, video lectures, courses,
    you name it. And all of that for the equivalent of about $1500 per year (if memory
    serves me right).

    and IT companies to them and these did the good work of selling and distributing
    Microsoft-software based solutions to the world. Together they acted as a huge
    force multiplier for Microsoft because they owed their livelihood to Microsoft.
    Microsoft certified them, sent business leads to them, and invited them to conferences.

    and the open source world but they have reinvented themselves magnificently. Their
    latest and greatest offering, Azure, might not be the best cloud around, but they
    are (again) successfully leveraging their existing channels into (large) customers
    to ensure the success of their offerings. And whereas you would once never be
