    not a roaring success. I was at Google at the time and my younger colleagues were
    making a lot of fun about its lack of accuracy and overall poor search quality.

    the benefits of software authors' time, effort, and capital without paying them
    as a rationale for refusing to publish the machine code for his company's flagship

    in the early 1990s Microsoft, which started its life as a Basic vendor, had pretty
    much ceded the Basic market to Borland’s [Turbo Basic](https://winworldpc.com/product/turbo-basic/1x).
    Microsoft’s Basic interpreters were so far behind that it was *almost* inconceivable
    that they would catch up. Almost. Microsoft decided to turn the table on them
    and commissioned **two** parallel projects to close the gap. The first project
    needed to make improvements to their current offering to make sure that it stayed
    vaguely competitive. The second project needed to come up with a completely new
    product that was going to capture the market. The first group of people did whatever
    needed to be done (by the way: Sucks to be in that team) whereas the second group
    created [Visual Basic](https://winworldpc.com/product/microsoft-visual-bas/30),
