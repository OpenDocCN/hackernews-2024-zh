    going up at alarming rates. Despite EVs reaching cost parity with gas cars by
    2027, the average cost of repairs following a major accident could increase by
    30 percent within that same time frame. This could cause insurance premiums to
    surge in price, or could lead to insurers flat-out denying coverage of some EV
    models. Per [Notebook Check](https://www.notebookcheck.net/Electric-cars-will-be-cheaper-to-make-than-gas-vehicles-but-with-much-higher-repair-and-insurance-costs.812031.0.html):'

    of fixing it after an accident becomes prohibitively expensive compared to gas
    cars with similar damages.

    cheaper to make than gas cars, EV repair costs hence insurance premiums will have

    will increase by 30%,” they argue, and ask that automakers bake repairability
    into the EV production methodology right now, or they will be faced with consumer
    backlash further down the road.

    as the repair could cost more than its residual value. Equally, more expensive
    crash repairs may lead to more expensive insurance premiums or even the refusal
    of insurance companies to cover particular car models.

- en: Right now, EVs are known for having greater up-front costs than comparable gas-powered
    cars. Making the case for EVs involves comparing their cost over the length of
    ownership, which yields significant savings due to lower refueling (or recharging)
    and lower maintenance bills. But lower production costs would invert that formula,
    making EVs cheaper to buy up-front but more expensive in the long run. At least,
    when taking into account EV insurance and repair costs.

    Model 3s only to make an about-face and sell off its rental EVs. Hertz expected
    to save money on fuel and maintenance, but failed to factor in the higher cost
    of insurance premiums and the possibility of its new EVs being written off due
    to prohibitively expensive repairs. To make matters worse, [trivial damage](https://jalopnik.com/ev-battery-damage-minor-crash-car-totaled-recycling-1850243294)
    that would be simple and cheap to fix on a gas-powered car can lead to prolonged
    wait times for repairs and write-offs in many cases due to the complexity of EV
    drivetrains and their charging systems.

    accidents, either. When a component fails on an EV due to a defect or during the
    course of normal use, the cost to fix fully-electric vehicles can easily exceed
    their worth, as in the case of this [Renault Zoe](https://jalopnik.com/the-zoe-led-renaults-electric-climb-up-the-sales-charts-1846041613)

    car which we bought secondhand from a friend in 2020\. We were initially very
    pleased with it. However, in July 2023, it stopped charging. It still drove fine,
    and there was nothing else wrong with it.

    to the charging unit had burnt out. They said the whole charging unit had to be

    on to explain that failing chargers are a “known problem” of the [Renault Zoe](https://jalopnik.com/the-renault-zoe-to-be-replaced-by-retro-ev-that-looks-i-1847414375),
    which manifests as the car ages. Given the 2017 model year cited by the owner,
    the car is [not *that* old at seven years](https://jalopnik.com/the-cars-trucks-on-the-road-are-older-than-ever-1850437250#:~:text=Now%2C%20the%20average%20age%20of,all%20time%20high%3A%2012.5%20years.).
    Or, it doesn’t seem old enough to be sent to scrap because its charging plug would
    cost more to fix than the whole car is worth. It looks like price parity with
    gas cars continues to elude EVs, at least until they can boast both lower production
    *and* repair costs.
