    Friday comes but once a week and *The Register* marks it by offering another instalment
    of On Call, our weekly reader-contributed column that shares your stories of the
    weird and woeful world of work.

- en: This week, meet a reader we'll Regomize as "Aaron" who very recently worked
    for a managed services provider in Australia. One of his clients was an ad agency
    that he described as "insanely flashy and demanding."

    that was used to store, among other things, plenty of uncompressed video and audio.
  id: totrans-split-9

- en: SharePoint choked on those files, and users wanted faster access. So the agency
    built a file server to host that in-demand data.
  id: totrans-split-10
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Except it wasn't really a server. It was a Mac Mini with some external USB drives.
    Data from SharePoint was stored on those drives in directories set up as SMB shares.

- en: This arrangement was obviously unstable, and the server would become unavailable
    if client devices updated macOS before the server. So every time Apple issued
    a new OS, Aaron rushed to update the server before the mismatch meant the ad agency
    lost access to its files.

- en: '"This was so common that we ended up creating an entire ticket stream just
    to monitor for macOS update emails as soon as Apple sent them," Aaron told On
    Call. But even with that early warning system in place, downtime was regular.'

    crew whenever the server became unavailable, citing the enormous cost of outages.

    go away.

    because they were personally sick of the problem," Aaron told On Call.'

- en: But the agency boss wouldn't buy a server, so Aaron and his colleagues lived
    in a horrible cycle of trying to keep the server updated, falling behind, fixing
    it, being berated by their rich client, recommending he pay for a new server,
    and being told "No."

    the external drives disappeared.

    Australian summer day in an airless office without air conditioning – until they
    figured out the fresh macOS update wasn't loading USB drivers and therefore wouldn't
    talk to the external disks.
