    (West Coast Editor) met with Wayne Rosing, Bruce Daniels, and Larry Tesler from
    Apple’s Lisa project to discuss the upcoming system. While the Lisa was not hugely
    successful (mainly because of the high price), it did lay the groundwork for the
    much more successful Macintosh, which was related the following year. Enjoy!*'

    development. We made exceptions if someone had specialized in something we were
    interested in or was a top student who also had good summer experience. We wanted
    an experienced team because what we''ve been doing is a very major software effort.

    the stepper motor so that if a head gets off track because of changes in humidity
    and temperature, the intelligent controller can hunt and find the track. So we
    have much better interchangeability, with much higher density, and we''re getting
    approximately 50 to 60 percent more data on that disk by good systems engineering.

    people who designed the hardware had to make decisions, for example, about whether
    the disk drive should have a door that you flip open or a button to push, that
    kind of thing. The designers focused on that aspect of the user interface even
    before the rest of the user interface. They didn''t want the user to be able to
    accidentally pull out a disk when it was being written on or something. So some
    decisions were made even before the hardware was designed. There have also been
    hardware revisions. The first Lisa hardware was here when I came, over two years

    We also really wanted to put an Enter key on the main keyboard because we would
    like to be able to offer a configuration in which an alphabetic keyboard and a
    numeric keyboard are independent—for, say, a company that does only word processing.
    Word processors don''t need the Clear function, but they do need the Enter function,
    so we wanted to be able to have the Enter key on the main keyboard; that way,
    even people without a numeric keypad can hit Enter. Again, on IBM and DEC keyboards
    the Enter key is standard; on many of those keyboards, that''s the standard position
    for the Enter key. So we decided to be more like other companies. The Enter key
    also gives us the option of removing the numeric keypad without losing an important
    function. And then the option keys were put on the side of those, and there we
    decided we did need two option keys, left and right, because they''re used very
    much like shift keys for typing, and in Europe it would be very important to be
    able to touch-type foreign alphabets for international correspondence, mathematical
    symbols, and other special characters. So there were some trade-offs. We didn''t
    want to just keep jamming two of every key on the keyboard, so we decided what

    can talk about what gate to use in some circuit or what routine to use in some
    program, but everybody can talk about the user interface. So we had to accommodate
    all of these things. And it turned out that good ideas and good criticisms came
    from everywhere. We had to come up with some objective way to decide. That''s
    why we established the methodology which involved user testing. We had a procedure
    for proposing changes, reviewing the changes, narrowing it down to a few choices,
    with certain criteria like consistency and parsimony. And then we actually implemented
    two or three of the various ways and tested them on users, and that''s how we

    of real beauties where the users couldn''t use any of the versions that were given

    was this: because we were able to interleave the memory and display cycles, we
    were able to essentially get data out of the memory at very little penalty. Using
    a 7220 would actually cost considerably more in terms of system performance. And
    there was one more consideration: with the 7220, you can''t access the display
    memory bank when the chip is refreshing the CRT, and that limits the time you
    can access it to about 10 percent of what we have, which would drastically affect
