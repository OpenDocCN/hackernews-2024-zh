    the stepper motor so that if a head gets off track because of changes in humidity
    and temperature, the intelligent controller can hunt and find the track. So we
    have much better interchangeability, with much higher density, and we''re getting
    approximately 50 to 60 percent more data on that disk by good systems engineering.

    We also really wanted to put an Enter key on the main keyboard because we would
    like to be able to offer a configuration in which an alphabetic keyboard and a
    numeric keyboard are independent—for, say, a company that does only word processing.
    Word processors don''t need the Clear function, but they do need the Enter function,
    so we wanted to be able to have the Enter key on the main keyboard; that way,
    even people without a numeric keypad can hit Enter. Again, on IBM and DEC keyboards
    the Enter key is standard; on many of those keyboards, that''s the standard position
    for the Enter key. So we decided to be more like other companies. The Enter key
    also gives us the option of removing the numeric keypad without losing an important
    function. And then the option keys were put on the side of those, and there we
    decided we did need two option keys, left and right, because they''re used very
    much like shift keys for typing, and in Europe it would be very important to be
    able to touch-type foreign alphabets for international correspondence, mathematical
    symbols, and other special characters. So there were some trade-offs. We didn''t
    want to just keep jamming two of every key on the keyboard, so we decided what

    there was one more consideration: with the 7220, you can''t access the display
    memory bank when the chip is refreshing the CRT, and that limits the time you
    can access it to about 10 percent of what we have, which would drastically affect

- en: 'Daniels: In fact, almost as important as the team building that we''ve gone
    through is building up this foundation that we''ve used to create the six applications
    we''ve now built. The foundation is an amazing application machine. We and others
    outside Apple can build applications that are just amazing now, because no one
    has to rebuild the foundation. It''s already there, in place, and we really hope
    to leverage off that in the future.'
