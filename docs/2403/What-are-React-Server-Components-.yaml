- en: Server Components represent a new type of React component specifically designed
    to operate exclusively on the server. And unlike client components, their code
    stays on the server and is never downloaded to the client. This design choice
    offers multiple benefits to React apps. Let's take a closer look at these benefits.

- en: First, in terms of bundle sizes, Server Components do not send code to the client,
    allowing large dependencies to remain server-side. This benefits users with slower
    internet connections or less capable devices by eliminating the need to download,
    parse, and execute JavaScript for these components. Additionally, it removes the
    hydration step, speeding up app loading and interaction.

- en: Second, by having direct backend access to server-side resources like databases
    or file systems, Server Components enable efficient data fetching and rendering
    without needing additional client-side processing. Leveraging the server's computational
    power and proximity to data sources, they manage compute-intensive rendering tasks
    and send only interactive pieces of code to the client.

- en: Third, Server Components' exclusive server-side execution enhances security
    by keeping sensitive data and logic, including tokens and API keys, away from
    the client-side.

- en: Fourth, Server Components enhance data fetching efficiency. Typically, when
    fetching data on the client-side using `useEffect`, a child component cannot begin
    loading its data until the parent component has finished loading its own. This
    sequential fetching of data often leads to poor performance.

- en: The main issue is not the round trips themselves, but that these round trips
    are made from the client to the server. Server Components enable applications
    to shift these sequential round trips to the server side. By moving this logic
    to the server, request latency is reduced, and overall performance is improved,
    eliminating client-server waterfalls.

- en: Fifth, rendering on the server enables caching of the results, which can be
    reused in subsequent requests and across different users. This approach can significantly
    improve performance and reduce costs by minimizing the amount of rendering and
    data fetching required for each request.

- en: Sixth, Initial Page Load and First Contentful Paint (FCP) are significantly
    improved with Server Components. By generating HTML on the server, pages render
    immediately without the delay of downloading, parsing, and executing JavaScript.

    is fully accessible to search engine bots, enhancing the indexability of your
    pages.

- en: Lastly, there's streaming. Server Components allows the rendering process to
    be divided into manageable chunks, which are then streamed to the client as soon
    as they are ready. This approach allows users to start seeing parts of the page
    earlier, eliminating the need to wait for the entire page to finish rendering
    on the server.
