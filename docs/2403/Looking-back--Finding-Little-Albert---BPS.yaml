    Rayner, attempted to condition a baby boy, Albert B., to fear a white laboratory
    rat (Watson & Rayner, 1920). They later reported that the child's fear generalised
    to other furry objects. The 'Little Albert' investigation was the last published
    study of Watson's academic career. Watson and Rayner became embroiled in a scandalous
    affair, culminating in his divorce and dismissal from Johns Hopkins.

    Harriet Lane Home, a paediatric facility on the Hopkins campus. She and her son
    lived at Harriet Lane for most of the boy's first year. Watson and Rayner reported
    that Albert was tested at 8 months 26 days, 11 months 3 days, 11 months 10 days,
    11 months 15 days, 11 months 20 days, and 12 months 21 days of age. It was also
    known that Albert was a male Caucasian. Though useful, this information had not
    led other researchers (e.g. Resnick, 1974) to Albert. New evidence was clearly
    needed if we hoped to identify Watson's famous participant.

    the investigators' write-up, the movie and Watson's correspondence with President
    Goodnow of Johns Hopkins we determined that Albert was born between 2 March and
    16 March 1919\. Adding 12 months 21 days, the age of the last assessment, to the
    birth date indicated that data collection concluded between 23 March and 6 April
    1920\. The process by which these dates were derived is more fully described elsewhere

    distributed throughout the year, then the probability that the child would be
    male and born in this period would be 1 in 52 (1/2 x 1/26). Although my assumptions
    were estimates, the calculations definitely showed that it was unlikely that anyone
    other than Albert would share these attributes.

    a more probable explanation is that Watson did not know the baby's name. In 1920
    Hopkins was a very stratified social environment (Park, n.d.). Interactions between

    brought forth some features, but the resolution was poor. Although we could not

    Albert is the face that psychology shows the general public. A more important,
    and often ignored role, is that stories, like that of Albert, are part of our
    collective memory. Our identification as psychologists is predicated upon knowledge
    and appreciation of our mutual history.
