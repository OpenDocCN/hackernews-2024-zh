    or household items such as shampoo and detergent bottles. Plastics don’t exist
    only as large objects, but also as microscopic particles that are released from
    these larger products. These microscopic plastics can end up in the environment,
    and they can be ingested into our bodies.

    have analyzed a couple of widely used consumer products to better understand these
    microscopic plastics. They found that when the plastic products are exposed to
    hot water, they release trillions of nanoparticles per liter into the water.

    There are a lot of them. Trillions per liter. We don’t know if those have bad
    health effects on people or animals. We just have a high confidence that they’re
    there,” said NIST chemist Christopher Zangmeister.

    but they are all made up of polymers, natural or human-made substances composed
    of large molecules linked together. Scientists have found microscopic particles
    from these larger plastics in the oceans and many other environments. Researchers
    categorize them into two groups: micro- and nanoplastics.'

    (one micrometer) and most can’t even be seen with a standard microscope. Recent
    studies have shown some consumer products that hold liquids or interact with them,
    such as polypropylene (PP) baby bottles and nylon plastic tea bags, release these
    plastic particles into the surrounding water.'

    products: food-grade nylon bags, such as baking liners — clear plastic sheets
    placed in baking pans to create a nonstick surface that prevents moisture loss
    — and single-use hot beverage cups, such as coffee cups. The beverage cups they
    analyzed were coated with low-density polyethylene (LDPE), a soft flexible plastic
    film often used as a liner.'

    degrees Fahrenheit) for 20 minutes.

    first needed to determine how to detect them. “Imagine having a cup of water in
    a generic to-go coffee cup. It could have many billions of particles, and we would
    need to figure out how to find these nanoplastics. It’s like finding a needle
    in a haystack,” Zangmeister said.

    the water that’s in the cup, spraying it out into a fine mist, and drying the
    mist and all that’s left within the solution,” said Zangmeister. Through this
    process, the nanoparticles are isolated from the rest of the solution.

    atmosphere. “So, we’re not reinventing the wheel but applying it to a new area,”
    said Zangmeister.

    and charge. Researchers could then specify a particular size, for example nanoparticles
    around 100 nanometers, and pass them into a particle counter. The nanoparticles
    were exposed to a hot vapor of butanol, a type of alcohol, then cooled down rapidly.
    As the alcohol condensed, the particles swelled from the size of nanometers to
    micrometers, making them much more detectable. This process is automated and run
    by a computer program, which counts the particles.

    by placing them on a surface and observing them with techniques known as scanning
    electron microscopy, which takes high-resolution images of a sample using a beam
    of high-energy electrons, and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, a technique
    that captures the infrared-light spectrum of a gas, solid or liquid.

    of the nanoparticles was between 30 nanometers and 80 nanometers, with few above
    200 nanometers. Additionally, the concentration of nanoparticles released into
    hot water from food-grade nylon was seven times higher compared with the single-use
    beverage cups.

    environment. People have looked at snow in Antarctica, the bottom of glacial lakes,
    and found microplastics bigger than about 100 nanometers, meaning they were likely
    not small enough to enter a cell and cause physical problems,” said Zangmeister.

    deal because they could get inside of a cell, possibly disrupting its function,”
    said Zangmeister, who also stressed that no one has determined that would be the
    case.

    the plastics that touch the food we eat or the water we drink. The agency has
    standards and safety measures in place to determine what’s safe. The FDA’s researchers
    run rigorous tests on these plastics and measure how much plastic mass is lost
    when exposed to hot water. For example, [the FDA has determined](https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfcfr/cfrsearch.cfm?fr=177.1520)
    that food grade nylon (such as that [used in tea bags](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/acs.est.9b02540))
    can safely lose up to 1% of its mass under high-temperature conditions. In the
    NIST study using their new technique, the researchers found one tenth of a percent
    of the mass was lost, which is significantly below current FDA limits for what’s
    considered safe.

    released into water from samples like coffee cups, but there are tests for nylon
    plastics. The findings from this study could help in efforts to develop such tests.
    In the meantime, Zangmeister and his team have analyzed additional consumer products
    and materials, such as fabrics, cotton polyester, plastic bags and water stored
    in plastic pipes.
