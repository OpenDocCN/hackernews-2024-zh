- en: 'As you know, since last year December, I wrote an ISCA paper in a very short
    time and it was submitted and accepted very quickly. As all of you know the reason,
    it was owe to our professor Dr.Tao Li ’s networking. Among the six reviewers of
    my paper, four of them are friends of Tao Li. But this paper has very severe issues:
    the design doesn’t make any sense and the reviewers also pay no attention to it.
    The paper was accepted at no reason which can make anyone feel guilty in this
    case.'

- en: After the deadline, crazy modifications of the paper were made and I started
    to make up for the missing experiments. During those experiments, I found that
    the phenomenon of the experiments and the design was different from what was claimed
    before, which made this paper doesn’t make any sense from title to characterization
    and to design. For example, It was claimed that this (the accelerator) is targeted
    for 3D CNN, which can maximize the performance by changing Diffy architecture
    to achieve the dynamic control of the temporal delta and spatial delta. But there
    are too many issues with this. First of all, the Diffy architecture has a serious
    problem of synchronization. If the width of the input feature is too narrow, the
    overhead of lane synchronization … . But it was assumed that the temporal dimension
    of 3D CNN (the maximum is generally 16 and it will decrease with layer) will expand
    with Diffy. Secondly, it can’t skip zero, because of the synchronization of lane
    and the incremental of spatial/temporal delta. So if I want to make a change the
    whole paper need to be rewrite. It is unrealistic to propose a totally new idea
    before the final version. After I communicated with Tao Li, it turned out that
    I have to fix the paper by myself. Until today I am still unable to patch up any
    of those issues. These issues are too obvious which can be easily caught by any
    experts of accelerator. I have no words to comment that Dr. Li acquiesced to the
    data which makes no sense.

    reputation in the area of Computer Architecture, my future life will be worse
    than death and I will be totally in a dilemma. I considered all the cases, I really
    can’t work them around. In order to make up for the fault, I decide to suicide.
    I hope you can learn my lessons and don’t mess around things. We shall never claim
    too much in the paper before we can really achieve it. I hope this will make a
    change in this world.
