    (*The Interpretation of Dreams*) is an [ancient Greek](/wiki/Ancient_Greece "Ancient
    Greece") treatise on [dream interpretation](/wiki/Dream_interpretation "Dream
    interpretation") written by [Artemidorus](/wiki/Artemidorus "Artemidorus") in
    the 2nd century AD,^([[1]](#cite_note-Brit-1)) and is the earliest extant Greek
    work on the subject, in five books, though in it Artemidorus mentions numerous
    other -- now lost -- works from which his own is at least partially derived, including
    the 1st century *Oneirocritica* by [Artemon of Miletus](/wiki/Artemon_of_Miletus
    "Artemon of Miletus").'

- en: The first three volumes were intended for the general public, providing an encyclopedic
    treatment of the subject matter of dreams, and the remaining two volumes were
    written for the private use of the author's son, a novice dream interpreter. Artemidorus
    inscribed the book "Artemidorus of Daldis", despite having been born in [Ephesus](/wiki/Ephesus
    "Ephesus"), to commemorate the little-known birthplace of his mother in [Lydia](/wiki/Lydia
    "Lydia") (3.66).

    waking life will affect the symbols in his dreams. He shows awareness of the dreaming
    mind's capacity to use [metaphors](/wiki/Metaphor "Metaphor") in its messages.

    to the anatomy and activity of the human body: 82 sections interpret the appearance
    in dreams of subjects like head size, eating, and sexual activity. For example,
    section 52 says, concerning one activity of the body, "All tools that cut and
    divide things in half signify disagreements, factions, and injuries ... Tools
    that smooth out surfaces predict an end to enmities."'

    animals, the gods and flying. The section on animals includes mammals (domestic
    and wild), sea creatures, reptiles, and those that fly. So in chapter 12 we find:
    "There is an affinity between all wild animals and our enemies. A [wolf](/wiki/Wolf
    "Wolf") signifies a violent enemy ... A [fox](/wiki/Fox "Fox") indicates that
    the enemy will not attack openly but will plot underhandedly."'

    of dreams, focusing on various situations and objects that may appear in dreams.
    Artemidorus continues his methodical analysis, examining the significance of dreams
    related to different aspects of everyday life and the natural world.^([[3]](#cite_note-3))

- en: Artemidorus moves from dream content to the technique of dream interpretation
    in book four, which is addressed to his son. He states that the interpreter needs
    to know the background of the dreamer, such as his occupation, health, status,
    habits, and age. The plausibility of dream content should be considered, which
    cannot be done without reference to the dreamer. The interpreter should find out
    how the subject feels about each component of the dream. In book five, Artemidorus
    presents a further 95 dreams he collected, for his son to use as practice material.

- en: Artemidorus stresses the empirical nature of his research. "I did not rely upon
    any simple theory of probabilities but rather on experience and the testimony
    of actual dream-fulfillments." His research took him to cities in [Greece](/wiki/Greece
    "Greece"), [Italy](/wiki/Italy "Italy") and its larger islands, and [Asia Minor](/wiki/Asia_Minor
    "Asia Minor"). He indicates that he reviewed all available literature on dreams,
    and that he spent years consulting with oral interpreters.
