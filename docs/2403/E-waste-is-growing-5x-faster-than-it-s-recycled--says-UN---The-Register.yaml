    estimated to include $23 billion of monetized value from avoided greenhouse gas
    emissions and $28 billion of recovered materials like gold, copper, and iron,
    it also comes at a cost – $10 billion associated with e-waste treatment and $78
    billion of externalized costs to people and the environment.

    And this is expected to reach $40 billion by 2030 if improvements in e-waste management
    and policies aren't made.

    a plug or battery – is growing at a rate of 2.6 million metric tons per year (a
    metric ton is equivalent to roughly 2,204.62 pounds – all units in this story
    are metric) and is expected to reach 82 million tons by 2030, from 62 million
    tons in 2022.

    which would roughly encircle the equator – if you parked them end-to-end and paved
    the relevant oceans. And that's to say nothing of the economic consequences of
    taking so many trucks out of service and disrupting global shipping routes with
    an equatorial parking structure, so let's not.

    million tons was documented, collected, and properly recycled. Another 16 million
    tons is said to have been recycled through undocumented channels in high and middle-income
    countries with developed waste management infrastructure.

    income countries without developed e-waste management systems – through which
    toxic chemicals get released. And the final 14 million tons are said to have been
    thrown away to end up mainly in landfills – also not ideal.

    capita e-waste generation is 17.6 kg and recycling is 7.5 kg. In [Oceania](https://www.iucn.org/our-work/region/oceania),
    it's 16.1 kg and 6.7 kg respectively. In the Americas, it's 14.1 kg and 4.2 kg.

    to make sure that initiatives to promote renewable energy don't end up undermining
    environmental concerns. It notes, for example, that e-waste from photovoltaic
    panels – to generate solar power – is expected to quadruple from 0.6 million tons
    in 2022 to 2.4 million tons in 2030.
