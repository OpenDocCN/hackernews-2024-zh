    "CityAirbus NextGen") prototype to the public, ahead of its maiden flight later
    this year. The two-tonne class CityAirbus, with a wing span of approximately 12
    metres,  is being developed to fly with an 80 km range and to reach a cruise speed
    of 120 km/h, making it perfectly suited for operations in major cities for a variety
    of missions.'

    Donauwörth, which will be dedicated to testing systems for electric vertical takeoff
    and landing vehicles (eVTOLs). The centre, which is part of Airbus’ ongoing and
    long-term investment in Advanced Air Mobility (AAM), began its operations with
    the CityAirbus NextGen’s power-on in December 2023 and it will be now used for
    the remaining tests required before the prototype’s maiden flight later in the
    year. These tests cover the electric motors with their eight rotors as well as
    the aircraft’s other systems such as flight controls and avionics.
