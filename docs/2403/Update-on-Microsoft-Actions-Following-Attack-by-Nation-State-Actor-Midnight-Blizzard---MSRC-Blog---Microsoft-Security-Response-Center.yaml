- en: This blog provides an update on the nation-state attack that was detected by
    the Microsoft Security Team on January 12, 2024\. As we [shared](https://msrc.microsoft.com/blog/2024/01/microsoft-actions-following-attack-by-nation-state-actor-midnight-blizzard/),
    on January 19, the security team detected this attack on our corporate email systems
    and immediately activated our response process. The Microsoft Threat Intelligence
    investigation identified the threat actor as [Midnight Blizzard](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/tag/midnight-blizzard-nobelium/?sort-by=newest-oldest&date=any),
    the Russian state-sponsored actor also known as NOBELIUM.

    additional details as appropriate.

- en: In recent weeks, we have seen evidence that Midnight Blizzard is using information
    initially exfiltrated from our corporate email systems to gain, or attempt to
    gain, unauthorized access. This has included access to some of the company’s source
    code repositories and internal systems. To date we have found no evidence that
    Microsoft-hosted customer-facing systems have been compromised.

    types it has found. Some of these secrets were shared between customers and Microsoft
    in email, and as we discover them in our exfiltrated email, we have been and are
    reaching out to these customers to assist them in taking mitigating measures.
    Midnight Blizzard has increased the volume of some aspects of the attack, such
    as password sprays, by as much as 10-fold in February, compared to the already
    large volume we saw in January 2024.

- en: Midnight Blizzard’s ongoing attack is characterized by a sustained, significant
    commitment of the threat actor’s resources, coordination, and focus. It may be
    using the information it has obtained to accumulate a picture of areas to attack
    and enhance its ability to do so. This reflects what has become more broadly an
    unprecedented global threat landscape, especially in terms of sophisticated nation-state
    attacks.

    coordination and mobilization, and have enhanced our ability to defend ourselves
    and secure and harden our environment against this advanced persistent threat.
    We have and will continue to put in place additional enhanced security controls,
    detections, and monitoring.
