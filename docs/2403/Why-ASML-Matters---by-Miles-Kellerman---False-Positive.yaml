    that you buy online despite that they never work. But in January, tech giant Intel

    system contains approximately 100,000 separate parts, whose delivery requires
    three cargo plans, 20 trucks, and 40 freight containers. But this is only the
    first step. Once Intel receives these parts, it takes 250 engineers six months
    to reconstruct the system onsite, which eventually weighs the equivalent of 150,000
    kilograms, or about 22 fully grown African elephants. The price: $380 million.'

    EXE:5200”。这个系统包含大约100,000个独立部件，其交付需要三个货运计划，20辆卡车和40个货柜。但这只是第一步。一旦英特尔收到这些零件，需要250名工程师在现场重建这个系统，最终重量相当于150,000公斤，约等于22头成年非洲象。价格：3.8亿美元。

    the world’s most advanced extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography system. EUV lithography
    is the process of employing rays of light to print cutting edge microchips. Each
    chip contains billions of individual transistors which determine their speed,
    efficiency, and capabilities. The TWINSCAN EXE:5200 prints these transistors by
    shooting rays of light through mirrors. But these are not just any mirrors. They
    have been engineered as the smoothest surfaces on Earth to ensure that each beam
    of light travels at incredible levels of accuracy. As Chris Miller summarizes
    in his fabulous book, *Chip War*, this system of EUV lithography is so accurate
    that it could be employed to hit a golf ball on the Moon with a laser.

    EXE:5200通过将光线射入镜子来打印这些晶体管。但这些不是普通的镜子。它们被设计为地球上最光滑的表面，以确保每束光都以令人难以置信的精度传播。正如克里斯·米勒在他的著作《芯片战争》中总结的那样，这种EUV光刻系统如此精确，以至于可以用激光打击月球上的高尔夫球。

    As Miller describes in *Chip War*, the U.S. granted ASML access to advanced research
    from the Department of Energy in the 1990s to help develop EUV lithography. Granting

    can, in essence, apply export controls on ASML’s products whenever it pleases.
    This is a tremendous source of power. Much like the way the Dutch control the
