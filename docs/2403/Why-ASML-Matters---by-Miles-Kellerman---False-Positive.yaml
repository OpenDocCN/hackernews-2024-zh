    it might be a new sweater. For others, it’s an electric-powered mosquito trap
    that you buy online despite that they never work. But in January, tech giant Intel
    received a truly remarkable delivery: the world’s first “TWINSCAN EXE:5200.” This
    system contains approximately 100,000 separate parts, whose delivery requires
    three cargo plans, 20 trucks, and 40 freight containers. But this is only the
    first step. Once Intel receives these parts, it takes 250 engineers six months
    to reconstruct the system onsite, which eventually weighs the equivalent of 150,000
    kilograms, or about 22 fully grown African elephants. The price: $380 million.'

    the world’s most advanced extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography system. EUV lithography
    is the process of employing rays of light to print cutting edge microchips. Each
    chip contains billions of individual transistors which determine their speed,
    efficiency, and capabilities. The TWINSCAN EXE:5200 prints these transistors by
    shooting rays of light through mirrors. But these are not just any mirrors. They
    have been engineered as the smoothest surfaces on Earth to ensure that each beam
    of light travels at incredible levels of accuracy. As Chris Miller summarizes
    in his fabulous book, *Chip War*, this system of EUV lithography is so accurate
    that it could be employed to hit a golf ball on the Moon with a laser.

    Semiconductor Materials Lithography. ASML, as it is more widely known, is a Dutch
    company headquartered just outside Eindhoven. Through decades of research and
    many billions of Euros in investment, ASML single-handedly developed the practical
    application of EUV lithography. There is no *market* for this product. It is a
    singular scientific achievement through which ASML has obtained a complete monopoly
    on the means of producing the world’s most advanced microchips. Without ASML’s
    systems, companies like Intel cannot manufacture the chips used in the world’s
    most sophisticated technological devices. This includes self-guided missiles,
    drones, and other military applications that will significantly impact who has
    the “edge” in our current era of great power competition.'

    threatening to leave the Netherlands. ASML has expressed concerns that recent
    proposals to curb immigration, including limiting foreign students and ending
    tax breaks for highly skilled immigrants, will make it harder to attract talent.
    CEO Peter Wennink bluntly stated in January: “The consequences of limiting labor
    migration are large, we need those people to innovate. If we can''t get those
    people here, we will go somewhere where we can grow.”'

    corporate environment. And, indeed, since Mark Rutte became Prime Minister in
    2010, Unilever and Royal Dutch Shell — two Dutch titans — moved their headquarters
    to London. But ASML is different. This is not just another big multinational.
    This is a company with a monopoly on the means of future warfare. Not since the
    Dutch East India Company has a corporate actor been so important to the geopolitical
    future of the Netherlands. Keeping ASML’s major EUV lithography operations is
    not, in other words, an economic question. It is a matter of national security.

    of EUV lithography systems, its sales determine who is capable of mass producing
    the world’s most advanced microchips. The list is not long: Intel, Samsung, and
    Taiwan’s TSMC account for about 80% of EUV sales. ASML is, in other words, a key
    “hub” in the global supply chain network of microchip production. And as Henry
    Farrell and Abraham Newman have [theorized](https://direct.mit.edu/isec/article/44/1/42/12237/Weaponized-Interdependence-How-Global-Economic),
    states can weaponize such hubs to exert costs on their adversaries. One method
    is the “chokepoint” effect:'

    difficult to circumvent them, states that can control hubs have considerable coercive
    power, and states or other actors that are denied access to hubs can suffer substantial
    consequences.

    ASML with a license to export its most advanced lithography machine (at the time)
    to a Chinese buyer. The U.S. immediately sought to block the sale and, following
    intense lobbying by the Trump administration, the Dutch government refused a renewal
    of the license and the machine was never shipped.

    the company has an office in the country and Chinese buyers accounted for more
    than 23% of global net sales in FY2023. But for its most advanced products, ASML
    must procure a license from the Dutch government. As the company warns investors
    in their latest annual report:'

- en: We are required under Dutch regulations and other applicable legislation to
    obtain licenses for the export of certain technologies. In some cases, such licenses
    have not been granted or renewed. For example, at the end of 2023, the Dutch government
    partially revoked a license for shipment of NXT:2050i and NXT:2100i systems, impacting
    a small number of customers in China. Following recent changes in the Dutch regulations,
    advanced DUV [Deep Ultraviolet]-immersion is also now subject to license requirement.

    power over ASML through export control regulation. Uncle Sam can exercise such
    power because ASML has substantial presence in the U.S. and is itself dependent
    on many key inputs manufactured in America. But the relationship goes deeper.
    As Miller describes in *Chip War*, the U.S. granted ASML access to advanced research
    from the Department of Energy in the 1990s to help develop EUV lithography. Granting
    such access to a foreign company — highly unorthodox — reflects the tremendous
    level of trust between both countries, who also closely cooperate on matters of
    intelligence, counterterrorism, and warfare.

    is a Dutch company and thus within their legal jurisdiction. The Dutch government
    can, in essence, apply export controls on ASML’s products whenever it pleases.
    This is a tremendous source of power. Much like the way the Dutch control the
    flow of water through their unmatched systems of dikes, dams, and floodgates,
    they can also control the flow of ASML’s exports to foreign buyers.

    India Company aggressively expanded across the globe, using force to dominate
    the international trade of spice, sugarcane, and human beings. This was the primary
    source of Dutch sovereign power: encouraging a private company to expand outward
    and bring wealth inward. But now the country’s most important power is precisely
    the reverse: *restricting* the export of critical technologies.'

    on that expansion — particularly in enormous growth markets like China — likely
    inspire internal frustration. One might expect ASML to utilize its monopoly power
    as a source of leverage to push back on these restrictions. This would fit the
    narrative pushed by some IR scholars that corporate actors have supplanted nation-states
    as the world’s most important political actors.

    chain that is largely within the jurisdiction of the U.S. and its allies. Important
    examples include Germany’s Zeiss and San Diego-based Cymer. Further, ASML, like
    most companies, is reliant on dollar-clearing facilities in the U.S. which America
    can choke-off through the use of sanctions. ASML cannot, in other words, simply
    pack up its things and move to Belarus to escape export controls. It is enmeshed
    in the Western-dominated cluster of economic networks — what Farrell and Newman
    refer to in a recent book as America’s *[Underground Empire](https://www.amazon.nl/-/en/Henry-Farrell/dp/1250840554)*.

    the world’s biggest companies are most capable of bending states to their will
    by, for example, threatening to relocate. But ASML exemplifies that *supply chain
    complexity* can have the opposite effect. In the context of great power competition,
    there appears to be an inverse relationship between supply chain complexity and
    the capacity of private actors to switch sides.

    the U.S. sphere of influence. Existing reports have suggested that ASML may be
    interested in shifting substantial operations to France. The U.S. may not love
    this idea. Its dynamics with France are…different. Remember when America swooped
    in to steal a $60 billion submarine contract with Australia? Whoops! But when
    it comes to ASML, America’s primary concern is upholding export controls vis-à-vis
    China and other adversaries. And there is little risk that France would fail to
    support this goal if ASML started manufacturing EUV lithography systems in la
    République.

    service. And, of course, the Netherlands is the home of international law, hosting
    both the International Court of Justice and the International Criminal Court.
    But its greatest power is arguably more subtle: its ability to control the most
    important hub in global microchip production.'

    efforts to create a competitor in the form of Shanghai Micro Electronics Equipment
    (SMEE). China wants to become self-sufficient in chip production, and it cannot
    do so while ASML retains its monopoly. Thus it is no surprise that ASML is a target
    of espionage. The company has reported theft of intellectual property by at least
    one Chinese employee. And though ASML has publicly rejected speculation of a tie
    to the Chinese government, it nevertheless acknowledges in its annual report that
    industrial espionage is a key security risk.

    the flow of critical technology to foreign adversaries. This is currently a black
    and white issue in the sense that certain actors — China, Russia, North Korea
    — simply cannot be allowed to import the world’s most important machine. But there
    are (and likely will be in the future) many grey areas where the Netherlands can
    employ its export controls as a source of leverage in negotiations. This includes
    negotiations with its allies. The looming U.S. election has forced European countries
    to consider how they might deal with an American autocrat. Retaining the capacity
    to control ASML would, for the Netherlands, be a sensible first step.
