    and never complains about a sore spine despite performing hour upon hour of what,
    for a regular farm hand, would be backbreaking labor checking Dutch tulip fields
    for sick flowers.

    the Dutch North Sea coast — is a new high-tech weapon in the battle to root out
    disease from the bulb fields as they erupt into a riot of springtime color.

    red “goudstuk” tulips, checking each plant and, when necessary, killing diseased
    bulbs to prevent the spread of the tulip-breaking virus. The dead bulbs are removed
    from healthy ones in a sorting warehouse after they have been harvested.

    flowers. It also weakens the bulb itself, eventually leaving them unable to flower.
