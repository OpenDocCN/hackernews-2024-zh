- en: NOORDWIJKERHOUT, Netherlands (AP) — Theo works weekdays, weekends and nights
    and never complains about a sore spine despite performing hour upon hour of what,
    for a regular farm hand, would be backbreaking labor checking Dutch tulip fields
    for sick flowers.

    the Dutch North Sea coast — is a new high-tech weapon in the battle to root out
    disease from the bulb fields as they erupt into a riot of springtime color.

- en: On a windy spring morning, the robot trundled Tuesday along rows of yellow and
    red “goudstuk” tulips, checking each plant and, when necessary, killing diseased
    bulbs to prevent the spread of the tulip-breaking virus. The dead bulbs are removed
    from healthy ones in a sorting warehouse after they have been harvested.

    flowers. It also weakens the bulb itself, eventually leaving them unable to flower.
