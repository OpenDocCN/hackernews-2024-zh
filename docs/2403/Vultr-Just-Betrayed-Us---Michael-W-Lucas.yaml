    fine print declares that we license our stuff to them, for full exploitation,
    without compensation.

    without console access, so I do not have to agree. If you use vultr, I suggest
    you do the same. Also contact [them through their contact page](https://www.vultr.com/company/contact/)
    and state your refusal. [I’m told you can cancel via their page without logging
    in](https://my.vultr.com/billing/cancel/), but haven’t yet tried it.

    Preferably that take custom installs.
