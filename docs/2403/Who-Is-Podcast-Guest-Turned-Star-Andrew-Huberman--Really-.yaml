- en: Today, Andrew Huberman is a stiff, jacked 48-year-old associate professor of
    neurology and ophthalmology at the Stanford University School of Medicine. He
    is given to delivering three-hour lectures on subjects such as “the health of
    our dopaminergic neurons.” His podcast is revelatory largely because it does not
    condescend, which has not been the way of public-health information in our time.
    He does not give the impression of someone diluting science to universally applicable
    sound bites for the slobbering masses. “Dopamine is vomited out into the synapse
    or it’s released volumetrically, but then it has to bind someplace and trigger
    those G-protein-coupled receptors, and caffeine increases the number, the density
    of those G-protein-coupled receptors,” is how he explains the effect of coffee
    before exercise in a two-hour-and-16-minute deep dive that has, as of this writing,
    nearly 8.9 million views on YouTube.

    increases in serotonin.” “Hmmm,” Rogan says. There is a kindness to the way Huberman
    reminds his audience always of the possibilities of neuroplasticity: They can
    change. He has changed. As an adolescent, he says, he endured the difficult divorce
    of his parents, a Stanford professor who worked in the tech industry and a children’s-book
    author. The period after the separation was, he says, one of “pure neglect.” His
    father was gone, his mother “totally checked out.” He was forced, around age 14,
    to endure a month of “youth detention,” a situation that was “not a jail,” but
    harrowing in its own right.'

    several therapists, and psychiatrist Paul Conti appears on his podcast frequently
    to discuss mental health. Therapy is “hard work … like going to the gym and doing
    an effective workout.” The brain is a machine that needs tending. Our cells will
    benefit from the careful management of stress. “I love *mechanism,*” says Huberman;
    our feelings are integral to the apparatus. There are Huberman Husbands (men who

    “slicing, staining, and prepping brains” and a wall of framed science publications
    in which Huberman-authored papers appear: *Nature,* *Cell Reports, The Journal

    straightforward educational videos in which he talks directly into the camera
    about subjects such as the organizational logic of the brain stem. Sometimes he
    would talk over a simple anatomical sketch on lined paper; the impression was,
    as it is now, of a fast-talking teacher in conversation with an intelligent student.
    The videos amassed a fan base, and Andrew was, in 2020, invited on some of the
    biggest podcasts in the world. On *Lex Fridman Podcast,* he talked about experiments
    his lab was conducting by inducing fear in people. On *The* *Rich Roll Podcast,*

    She had old friends who adored her and no trouble making new ones. She came across
    as scattered in the way she jumped readily from topic to topic in conversation,
    losing the thread before returning to it, but she was in fact extremely organized.
    She was a woman who kept track of things. She was an entrepreneur who could organize
    a meeting, a skill she would need later for reasons she could not possibly have
    predicted. When I asked her a question in her home recently, she said the answer

    a wealthy city separate from Oakland. That turned out not to be precisely true;
    he lived off Piedmont Avenue, which was in Oakland. He was courtly and a bit formal,

    alcohol,” he fails to mask his obvious disapproval of anyone who consumes alcohol
    in any quantity. He follows a time-restricted eating schedule. He discusses constraint
    even in joy, because a dopamine spike is invariably followed by a drop below baseline;
    he explains how even a small pleasure like a cup of coffee before every workout
    reduces the capacity to release dopamine. Huberman frequently refers to the importance
    of “social contact” and “peace, contentment, and delight,” always mentioned as
    a triad; these are ultimately leveraged for the one value consistently espoused:

    of a powder formerly known as Athletic Greens and now as AG1\. It is one thing
    to hear Athletic Greens promoted by Joe Rogan; it is perhaps another to hear someone
    who sells himself as a Stanford University scientist just back from the lab proclaim
    that this $79-a-month powder “covers all of your foundational nutritional needs.”
    In an industry not noted for its integrity, AG1 is, according to writer and professional
    debunker Derek Beres, “one of the most egregious players in the space.” Here we
    have a powder that contains, according to its own marketing, 75 active ingredients,
    far more than the typical supplement, which would seem a selling point but for
    the inconveniences of mass. As performance nutritionist Adam McDonald points out,
    the vast number of ingredients indicates that each ingredient, which may or may
    not promote good health in a certain dose, is likely included in minuscule amounts,
    though consumers are left to do the math themselves; the company keeps many of
    the numbers proprietary. “We can be almost guaranteed that literally every supplement
    or ingredient within this proprietary blend is underdosed,” explains McDonald;
    the numbers, he says, don’t appear to add up to anything research has shown to
    be meaningful in terms of human health outcomes. And indeed, “the problem with
    most of the probiotics is they’re typically not concentrated enough to actually
    colonize,” one learns from Dr. Layne Norton in a November 2022 episode of *Huberman
    Lab.* (AG1 argues that probiotics are effective and that the 75 ingredients are
    “included not only for their individual benefit, but for the synergy between them
    — how ingredients interact in complex ways, and how combinations can lead to additive
    effects.”) “That’s the good news about podcasts,” Huberman said when Wendy Zukerman
    of *Science Vs* pointed out that her podcast would never make recommendations
    based on such tenuous research. “People can choose which podcast they want to

    Beres的说法，AG1是“这个领域中最为严重的参与者之一”。这里有一种粉末，根据其自己的营销，含有75种活性成分，远远超过典型的补充剂，这似乎是一个卖点，但是大量的成分却带来了质量上的不便。正如性能营养师Adam
    McDonald指出的那样，大量的成分表明每种成分（可能或可能不在某种剂量下促进健康）很可能只包含微量，尽管消费者被留给自己算账；公司保留了许多数字的专有性。麦当劳解释说：“我们几乎可以保证，这种专有混合物中的每一种补充剂或成分都是剂量不足的。”他说，这些数字似乎不能形成任何对人类健康结果有意义的研究。确实，“大多数益生菌的问题在于它们通常不能浓缩到足以实际殖民的程度”，人们从*Huberman实验室*2022年11月的一集中了解到。（AG1认为益生菌是有效的，并且这75种成分“不仅包括其个别益处，还包括它们之间的协同作用——成分如何以复杂方式相互作用，以及这些组合如何导致加成效果。”）“这就是播客的好处”，Huberman在Wendy

    Ferriss和Peter Attia的节目中重复了这个故事。他告诉*Time*杂志和*Stanford*杂志。“拿着父母在离婚时不应该做的事情清单，”他最近告诉基督徒弓箭手卡梅伦·海恩斯。“他们全都做了。”“你有，”Wendy
    Zukerman用她明亮的澳洲口音说，“一段流浪的童年。”“我觉得对于听那些有着你这样生平的人的人来说是非常容易的，”Tim Ferriss说，“去假设一定有一条特定的生活轨迹，对吧？认为一切都来得容易。”他的父母一致认为“在我们离婚后对安德鲁来说是非常艰难的时期”，尽管他们“不同意”他对过去的某些描述；很少有父母愿意被指责“纯粹忽视”。

    killed themselves while we were there.” (*New York* was unable to find an account

- en: Andrew attended Gunn, a high-performing, high-pressure high school. Classmates
    describe him as always with a skateboard; they remember him as pleasant, “sweet,”
    and not particularly academic. He would, says one former classmate, “drop in on
    the half-pipe,” where he was “encouraging” to other skaters. “I mean, he was a
    cool, individual kid,” says another classmate. “There was one year he, like, bleached
    his hair and everyone was like, ‘Oh, that guy’s cool.’” It was a wealthy place,
    the kind of setting where the word *au pair* comes up frequently, and Andrew did
    not stand out to his classmates as out of control or unpredictable. They do not
    recall him getting into street fights, as Andrew claims he did. He was, says Andrew’s
    father, “a little bit troubled, yes, but it was not something super-serious.”

  zh: 安德鲁曾就读于冈恩高中，这是一所成绩优异、压力很大的高中。同学们描述他总是带着滑板；他们记得他很和蔼，“甜美”，并不特别重视学术。有一位前同学说，他会在半管道上来个“突然造访”，他对其他滑板者“鼓励有加”。另一位同学说：“我的意思是，他是一个很酷的、个性鲜明的孩子。”另一位同学说：“有一年他像漂白了头发，大家都说‘哦，那家伙很酷’。”那是一个富裕的地方，那种地方经常会提到“半工半读的外国佣人”，安德鲁在同学中并没有因为不受控制或不可预测而显眼。他们不记得他参与街头斗殴，就像安德鲁声称他做过的那样。安德鲁的父亲说，他“有点烦恼，是的，但不是什么特别严重的事情。”
- en: 'What does seem certain is that in his adolescence, Andrew became a regular
    consumer of talk therapy. In therapy, one learns to tell stories about one’s experience.
    A story one could tell is: I overcame immense odds to be where I am. Another is:
    The son of a Stanford professor, born at Stanford Hospital, grows up to be a Stanford
    professor.'

  zh: 似乎可以确定的是，在他的青少年时期，安德鲁成为心理治疗的常客。在治疗中，人们学会讲述关于自己经历的故事。一个可能会说的故事是：我克服了巨大的困难来到今天的位置。另一个是：斯坦福教授的儿子，在斯坦福医院出生，长大后成为了一名斯坦福教授。
- en: I have never,” says Amit, “met a man more interested in personal growth.” Andrew’s
    relationship to therapy remains intriguing. “We were at dinner once,” says Eve,
    “and he told me something personal, and I suggested he talk to his therapist.
    He laughed it off like that wasn’t ever going to happen, so I asked him if he
    lied to his therapist. He told me he did all the time.” (A spokesperson for Huberman
    denies this.)

  zh: 我从未见过一个人对个人成长如此感兴趣，”阿米特说道。安德鲁与心理治疗的关系仍然令人着迷。“有一次我们在吃饭，”伊夫说，“他告诉我一些私人事情，我建议他去找他的治疗师。他笑了笑，好像那根本不会发生，于是我问他是否对他的治疗师撒谎。他告诉我他经常这样做。”（胡伯曼的一位发言人否认了这一点。）
- en: '“People high on psychopathy are good at deception,” says Buss. “I don’t know
    if they’re good at self-deception.” With repeated listening to the podcast, one
    discerns a man undergoing, in public, an effort to understand himself. There are
    hours of talking about addiction, trauma, dopamine, and fear. Narcissism comes
    up consistently. One can see attempts to understand and also places where those
    attempts swerve into self-indulgence. On a recent episode with the Stanford-trained
    psychiatrist Paul Conti, Andrew and Conti were describing the psychological phenomenon
    of “aggressive drive.” Andrew had an example to share: He once canceled an appointment
    with a Stanford colleague. There was no response. Eventually, he received a reply
    that said, in Andrew’s telling, “Well, it’s clear that you don’t want to pursue
    this collaboration.”'

  zh: “心理变态的人擅长欺骗，”巴斯说。“我不知道他们是否善于自欺。”通过反复听这个播客，人们可以看出一个公开在努力理解自己的人。有数小时的谈论成瘾、创伤、多巴胺和恐惧。自恋始终是一个话题。人们可以看到他试图理解自己的努力，以及这些努力是否转向了自我放纵的地方。在最近与斯坦福训练有素的精神病学家保罗·康蒂的一集中，安德鲁和康蒂描述了“攻击性驱动”的心理现象。安德鲁有一个例子要分享：他曾取消了与一位斯坦福同事的约会。没有回应。最终，他收到了一封回复，据安德鲁说，“嗯，显然你不想继续这个合作。”

    unhappiness. It would appear, at a distance, to be an elaborate fantasy of an

- en: There is an argument to be made that it does not matter how a helpful podcaster
    conducts himself outside of the studio. A man unable to constrain his urges may
    still preach dopaminergic control to others. Morning sun remains salutary. The
    physiological sigh, employed by this writer many times in the writing of this
    essay, continues to effect calm. The large and growing distance between Andrew
    Huberman and the man he continues to be may not even matter to those who buy questionable
    products he has recommended and from which he will materially benefit, or listeners
    who imagined a man in a white coat at work in Palo Alto. The people who definitively
    find the space between fantasy and reality to be a problem are women who fell
    for a podcaster who professed deep, sustained concern for their personal growth,
    and who, in his skyrocketing influence, continued to project an image of earnest
    self-discovery. It is here, in the false belief of two minds in synchronicity
    and exploration, that deception leads to harm. They fear it will lead to more.
