- en: Cables laid deep in the ocean underpin the wireless internet world, carrying
    data across continents through connected landing stations and data centers. Google
    and Meta have in recent years become the biggest names in the business of laying
    these fiber optic cables in Africa, as part of their investment and product expansion
    drives in the continent.

    by last week’s incident. 2Africa, the 45,000km cable being deployed by a Meta-led
    consortium which landed in Nigeria and Ghana last month, was also not named as
    one of those affected. Access to WhatsApp, Instagram and Facebook apps owned by
    Meta remained normal in both Nigeria and [Ghana](https://twitter.com/BBSimons/status/1768292967989588457).

    normally available. Its $1 billion Equiano cable is present in Nigeria, Togo and
    Namibia. Seacom, a cable company that focuses on East and Southern Africa, said
    it [rerouted its traffic](https://twitter.com/SEACOM/status/1769344459202760940)
    to Equiano after the disruption.
