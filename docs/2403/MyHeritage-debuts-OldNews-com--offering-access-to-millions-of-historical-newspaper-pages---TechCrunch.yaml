    collecting together the very best of the history of the world,” said Myko Clelland,
    MyHeritage’s Director of Content in Europe, in an emailed statement. “Following
    the digitization process, we applied our cutting-edge proprietary new optical
    character recognition and AI language modeling process to the printed material.
    This then gave us an accurate, best in class text database, exclusive to OldNews,
    that can be searched and matched using names, dates, locations and keywords.”

    thumbnail image of articles highlighting the terms from your search. The terms
    will remain highlighted if you choose to view a full article. You can print out
    the document or download it to your computer. MyHeritage plans to release additional
    browsing capabilities in the coming months, such as the ability to save and share
    newspaper clippings.

    in the past, anyone can be found in them, which makes historical newspapers valuable
    to genealogists, historians, and educators. They are also valuable to the average
    person. For example, you could try to find your grandparents’ or great-grandparents’
    marriage announcements using their names and the year they were married.

    the beginning; we have an incredible pipeline of additional content and features,
    and ambitious plans to make OldNews.com the number-one online repository of international
    historical newspapers beyond the English-speaking world.”

    being shut down and their [content being removed](https://slate.com/business/2024/02/messenger-gawker-vice-media-layoffs-sites-deleted-why.html)
    from their websites, deleting access to thousands of news articles and features
    from recent decades. Given the importance of preserving news content, the launch
    of OldNews is a nice way to celebrate journalism while ensuring easy access to
    important historical accounts.
