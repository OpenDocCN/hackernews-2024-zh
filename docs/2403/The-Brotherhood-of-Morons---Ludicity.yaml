    to affect their fellow men. Some stupid people normally cause only limited losses
    while others egregiously succeed in causing ghastly and widespread damages not
    only to one or two individuals but to entire communities or societies. [...] The
    second factor which determines the potential of a stupid person is related to
    the position of power and consequence which he occupies in society.

    explicitly asking whether they *still* encounter the same percentage of people
    who are invariably totally destructive amongst medical professionals, they agreed
    so emphatically that I asked the question three more times because I *really*
    thought doctors would have a lower dipshit-rate than the rest of us.

    in totally destructive behaviour regardless of whether they are a prince or a
    pauper, it naturally follows that some idiots are very important. For many years,
    I have been astounded that society seems to reward fools more readily than they
    reward the truly intelligent, a belief which manifested in my demented writing.

    directors in my department, a large organization with national name recognition.
    Two of them are intelligent, and it is a privilege to work with them. A few are
    bandits, though not of the overtly malignant variety - they're just not savvy
    enough to realize that they're incompetent, so they are unknowing leeches. The
    remainder are simply stupid. This is *approximately* the composition of the organization
    writ large. The number of people at this organization who dislike their job, their
    stakeholders, and their salary *but don't leave* even though they no longer have
    the energy to work is astonishing, and that alone is enough to constitute stupidity
    as per Cipolla's definition.

    because of their startling foolishness, but simply because they are stupid in
    exactly the same proportions as the stock from which they are elevated. Most of
    us are not so naive as to believe that elevation is meritocratic, but most of
    us expect that the filter has *some* effect on the distribution of individuals
    that are moved to power. It probably adds some bandits and removes some of the
    helpless, we like to think - but perhaps it leaves the stupid totally untouched.
    And once they're there, every mistake they make is so greatly amplified that it
    starts to feel like *everyone* in leadership is a moron. But the people around
    them are as at their mercy as the rest of us - there is no defense when the stupid
    attack. Does that sound implausible?

    While my direct social circle is full of brilliant, compassionate people, I must
    concede that I spend a fair amount of time dealing with The Brotherhood (mostly
    at work) without having really spent enough effort to say it was inevitable. I'll
    be making some moves to rectify this, even if it means having to spend more energy
    working elsewhere - the risk of a fool destroying our department's budget and
    putting me out of a job is too high. The easy work isn't worth it, plus I'm always
