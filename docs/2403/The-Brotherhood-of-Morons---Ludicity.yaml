    you have no evidence beyond their presentation skills that this is a true anomaly,
    *get far away from them*. It doesn't matter how exploitable they seem to be, or
    how it might benefit you in the short-term, they will eventually self-immolate
    in a way that will set fire to something you care about. And again, this is very
    important, *presentation skills don't count*, even if they say things that frequently
    indicate a great awareness of what would constitute intelligent action. The two
    worst managers I've ever met spoke as if they knew *exactly* how to run a team,
    but then did none of the things they said they would do, regardless of how easy
    it would have been.
