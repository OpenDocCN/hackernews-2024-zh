    a collection of 15,000 articles on a single subject: the roads and highways of
    the United States. Despite minor disagreements the US Roads Project mostly worked
    in harmony, but recently, a long-simmering debate over the website’s rules drove
    this community to the brink. Efforts at compromise fell apart. There was a schism,
    and in the fall of 2023, the editors packed up their articles and moved over to
    a website dedicated to roads and roads alone. It’s called [AARoads](https://www.aaroads.com/),
    a promised land where the editors hope, at last, that they can find peace.'

    give them much attention,” said editor Michael Gronseth, who goes by Imzadi1979
    on Wikipedia, where he dedicated his work to Michigan highways, specifically.
    But a road has so much to offer if you look beyond the asphalt. It’s the nexus
    of history, geography, travel, and government, a seemingly perfect subject for
    the hyper-fixations of Wikipedia. “But there was a shift about a year ago,” Gronseth
    said. “More editors started telling us that what we’re doing isn’t important enough,
    and we should go work on more significant topics.”

    edit Wikipedia, but that doesn’t mean you can write whatever you want. For one,
    a subject has to be notable. Your grandma’s “famous” cookie recipe can’t have
    an article unless it’s actually famous. The site isn’t a place for personal opinions,
    either. Original research is forbidden. In general, articles are expected to have
    multiple sources, and there are rules about what qualifies as a citation. Primary
    sources, where a person or an organization talks about themselves, are viewed
    with skepticism. Secondary sources, written by someone unrelated to the topic,
    are the gold standard. For some roads, these rules get complicated.

- en: There are whole books about Route 66 and even minor roads in metropolitan areas
    get coverage in the local papers. But you may have trouble finding secondary sources
    about the Cherokee Hills Scenic Byway in Oklahoma. So, if you want to write that
    the byway starts in Tahlequah and ends at West Siloam Springs, can you cite a
    map published by the Oklahoma Department of Transportation? You can see that with
    your own eyes, but the map doesn’t say it in words. After years of permissiveness,
    a growing contingent of Wikipedia editors started to argue that such a scenario
    counts as an *interpretation* of the map, and therefore, it’s illegitimate original
    research. What’s more, that’s technically a primary source, because the Oklahoma
    Department of Transportation builds and maintains the road. And without secondary
    sources, maybe the Byway isn’t notable enough for a dedicated article in the first
    place.

    Siloam Springs结束，你能引用俄克拉荷马州交通部发布的地图吗？你可以亲眼看到，但地图并没有用文字表达。经过多年的放任，越来越多的维基百科编辑开始争论这种情况是否算是地图的*解释*，因此，它是不合法的原创研究。更重要的是，这从技术上来说是一种一手资料，因为俄克拉荷马州交通部建设和维护这条路。如果没有次要来源，也许这条Byway并不足够显著以至于有专门的文章。

    and they get their own pages. But by 2005, Wikipedia had amassed articles about
    lesser characters, and the website came together and decided that only the best
    and brightest Pokémon warrant a dedicated article. Faced with a mass deletion
    of their hagiographies on Dragonite and Garchomp, the Pokémon editors forked their
