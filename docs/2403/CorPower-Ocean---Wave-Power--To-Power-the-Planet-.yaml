- en: In storm protection mode, the devices are detuned making them transparent to
    incoming waves, similar to wind turbines pitching their blades to protect from
    excessive loads. In normal conditions, the devices are tuned and set in optimal
    timing with each incoming wave, strongly amplifying the motion and power capture.
