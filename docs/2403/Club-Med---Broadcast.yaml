    and grad school, in ad agencies and magazines, many of our most powerful minds
    are flying on prescription-grade speed. And all these uppers do a lot more than
    increase productivity. They induce a particular set of behaviors—a passive-aggressive
    management style, a manic discourse, a sarcastic affect—that can fuse into a culture
    when the number of users reaches critical mass.

    since Adderall first passed FDA approval in 1996\. If Adderall were not considered
    a productivity drug—economically beneficial, on balance—we would almost certainly
    be talking about an amphetamine epidemic. And maybe we should be. Adderall’s efficacy
    for treating ADHD, and its popularity among the Professional Managerial Class,
    has helped obscure what a strange and deleterious drug it can be. Adderall is
    highly addictive, the returns it delivers are steadily diminishing, and the risks
    of heart disease and psychosis increase by the year. In the meantime, it just
    makes you kind of annoying.

    history, and collision with my life. While an alcoholic writing a history of alcohol
    might struggle to stay on the ball, in my case substance and subject were perfectly
    matched. Night after night I brought myself to the verge of a heart attack paging

    you are nine years old, flying on pharmaceutical speed, and listening to it on

    a drugged class clown, except perhaps for that clown''s teachers, school administrators,

    wind up liking it in adulthood, after developing the kinds of worldly ambitions

    in psychosis or heroin addiction, although many do. And that's not to say that
    widespread amphetamine use isn't a social harm—but sometimes it seems like the
    consequences might be a bit more subtle or pernicious, especially when it's being
    taken by, say, a working professional, who might actually be sticking to low doses,
    and not necessarily escalating and taking ten then fifteen then twenty milligrams...so
    I'm wondering what you think the downside of amphetamine is when it's used, maybe
    the word isn't responsibly, but when it's used in relatively low doses over an
    extended period of time.

    Obetrol’s manufacturers. In a complaint to the DOJ, he accused the company of
    selling high doses of Obetrol with no license, and promoting the drug with the
    “unsupportable and illogical” claim that it was safer and more effective than
    other amphetamines (a theme Adderall would pick up a few decades later).'

    to curb the speed crisis, declaring the drug “ineffective” and “lacking in proof

    it contained for various amphetamine salts—the soon-to-be patented Adderall recipe—and
    resumed distribution, albeit in small enough quantities to evade regulatory notice.
    The drug’s circulation in the 1970s and 1980s is hard to trace, although it had
    a way of popping up in huge quantities at random doctor’s offices across the country.
    One news report in the 1980s highlighted the work of Ohio doctor Mattie Vaughn,
    whose practice was described in a court memo as “nothing more than a thinly disguised
    drug-trafficking operation,” and who in eighteen months dispensed nearly 140,000

    coach-cum-pain pill entrepreneur named Roger Griggs examined its meager assets
    and seized on a surprising detail. Almost all of Obetrol’s minimal sales—$40,000
    a year—were attributable to a single child psychiatrist: a Dr. Robert Jones based
    in Provo, UT. Griggs made plans to visit him. Over lunch in Provo, the enterprising
    doctor reported that he had been prescribing Obetrol to ADHD kids who couldn’t
    tolerate Ritalin. The results, he claimed, had been spectacular. Griggs was sold.
    He bought the drug, changed its name (ADD for All: Adderall) and began marketing
    it at scale with his company Richwood. By the middle of 1994, just a few months
    into this campaign, 30,000 children were on it.'

    was technically illegal. Nonetheless, Richwood promptly initiated a marketing
    campaign in a prominent child psychiatry journal, triggering a warning letter

    right to manufacture a combination of peanut butter and jelly. The drug’s chemical
    makeup and subjective effects were functionally indistinguishable from Dexedrine,
    which had lost its patent decades ago. Had Adderall been submitted as a completely
    new drug, rather than as a “supplement” to Obetrol’s 1950s-era application, it

    its effectiveness. Why? As *New York Times* journalist Alan Schwarz reports in
    his book *ADHD Nation*, a senator's son had been taking Adderall before the FDA
    intervened; the senator "pitched a fit" and the agency rushed to approve it. Who
    that senator was Schwarz doesn’t say, but my research suggests it was Orrin Hatch,

    dependency, or both, or neither. Does it matter that the US is the only country

    opioid use, might appear, these phenomena are effectively mono-causal?

    Richwood a reason to get as many people as possible hooked on amphetamines. If
    Adderall’s pushers have since evaded Sackler-style comeuppance, this can be largely
    attributed to the fact that it’s basically impossible to fatally overdose on it.

    start-ups like Done propose we solve with *more* Adderall, and critics propose
    we solve by rolfing, or something. There is a growing consensus that the attention
    crisis is, at bottom, caused by the Internet, which has in turn caused the rise
    of Adderall usage and prescriptions. But what if this story has things the wrong
    way around? Working backward from the neurochemical effects of the drug, it begins
    to seem plausible that, in fact, Adderall’s prevalence was the *sine qua non*
    of the Internetified attention economy and its perpetual crises.

    “hysterical realism.” It was meant to describe what he saw as a new type of fiction
    that resorted to paroxysms of erratic and baroque detail in order to veil the
    lack at its core—the lack being attention at the human scale. “An endless web
    is all they need for meaning,” wrote Wood, although he might as well have said
    these novels were, in contemporaneous slang, ‘so random.’ David Foster Wallace’s

    that it works by increasing the neurochemical signal that makes you want to keep
    doing whatever it is that you’re doing. Specifically, dopamine signals whether
    an activity is better or worse than expected: for example, if you get two gumballs
    from the machine when you expected to only get one, the physiology of the resulting
    jackpot thrill is caused by increased dopamine signaling. Any drug that floods
    the brain with dopamine will render the user hyper-vulnerable to getting stuck
    in repetitive behavioral loops, especially when the reward is unpredictable (the
    technical term is “variable reward.”) This is why gumball machines aren’t addictive
    and slot machines are. Amphetamines work by turning whatever you’re doing into
    a slot machine. If the Internet is the giant casino in which we are all now imprisoned,
    then dopaminergic drugs hook us deeper into its reward structures—like the ones
    that have you checking your notifications “one more time,” or opening a browser
    tab to Twitter through muscle memory that seems hardwired past your best intentions.'

    best illuminated by what psychiatrist Gosta Rylander first described as “punding”
    in 1970\. “The patient becomes obsessed with an activity that, while harmless
    on its own terms, comes to consume their life,” he wrote. “They become irritable
    whenever someone distracts them from their preferred behavioral loop.” Current
    clinical literature describes punding as “non-goal oriented, repetitive activity
    such as manipulation of technical equipment, handling, examining or sorting through
    objects, grooming, or hoarding.” These activities offer a soothing flow state
    reinforced by periodic reward, balancing undemanding stimulation with endless
    repeatability. “Repetitive Reward Seeking Behavior” syndromes of this kind tend
    to be observed in people who are taking drugs that flood their central nervous
    system with dopamine, and are most frequently observed in Parkinson’s patients
    being treated with dopamine replacement therapy, and amphetamine users.

    much as I wish there were a better version of it out there. Imagine: something
    equally euphoric but impossible to abuse. Something that gets you to work, but

    (a velvet bean containing high doses of the amino acid L-dopa) and fish oil, looking
    for an affordable CBT practitioner and a walking desk. I apologize in advance
    for any delays.♦'
