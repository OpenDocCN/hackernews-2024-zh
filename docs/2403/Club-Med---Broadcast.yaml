    and grad school, in ad agencies and magazines, many of our most powerful minds
    are flying on prescription-grade speed. And all these uppers do a lot more than
    increase productivity. They induce a particular set of behaviors—a passive-aggressive
    management style, a manic discourse, a sarcastic affect—that can fuse into a culture
    when the number of users reaches critical mass.

    since Adderall first passed FDA approval in 1996\. If Adderall were not considered
    a productivity drug—economically beneficial, on balance—we would almost certainly
    be talking about an amphetamine epidemic. And maybe we should be. Adderall’s efficacy
    for treating ADHD, and its popularity among the Professional Managerial Class,
    has helped obscure what a strange and deleterious drug it can be. Adderall is
    highly addictive, the returns it delivers are steadily diminishing, and the risks
    of heart disease and psychosis increase by the year. In the meantime, it just

- en: 'Goodrich was a virtuous public servant: on his retirement, he was hailed as
    the FDA’s “most influential figure and guardian of its institutional memory.”
    In an era when the agency was a public joke, lacking even basic enforcement powers,
    he made it his mission to harass profiteers—among them, notably, Rexar Pharmaceuticals,
    Obetrol’s manufacturers. In a complaint to the DOJ, he accused the company of
    selling high doses of Obetrol with no license, and promoting the drug with the
    “unsupportable and illogical” claim that it was safer and more effective than
    other amphetamines (a theme Adderall would pick up a few decades later).'

    Pharmaceuticals，即Obetrol的制造商。在向司法部的投诉中，他指控该公司未经许可销售高剂量的Obetrol，并声称该药比其他安非他命更安全和更有效是“毫无依据和不合逻辑”的说法（这个主题几十年后被Adderall继承）。
- en: The FDA finally banned Obetrol in 1973 as part of the agency’s broader effort
    to curb the speed crisis, declaring the drug “ineffective” and “lacking in proof
    of safety.” In response, Rexar reformulated Obetrol, swapping out the methamphetamine
    it contained for various amphetamine salts—the soon-to-be patented Adderall recipe—and
    resumed distribution, albeit in small enough quantities to evade regulatory notice.
    The drug’s circulation in the 1970s and 1980s is hard to trace, although it had
    a way of popping up in huge quantities at random doctor’s offices across the country.
    One news report in the 1980s highlighted the work of Ohio doctor Mattie Vaughn,
    whose practice was described in a court memo as “nothing more than a thinly disguised
    drug-trafficking operation,” and who in eighteen months dispensed nearly 140,000

    Vaughn的工作，他的实践被法庭备忘录描述为“不过是一个伪装成药物交易的操作”，他在十八个月内向4,500名患者配发了近14万份这种新Obetrol。

    and seized on a surprising detail. Almost all of Obetrol’s minimal sales—$40,000
    a year—were attributable to a single child psychiatrist: a Dr. Robert Jones based
    in Provo, UT. Griggs made plans to visit him. Over lunch in Provo, the enterprising
    doctor reported that he had been prescribing Obetrol to ADHD kids who couldn’t
    tolerate Ritalin. The results, he claimed, had been spectacular. Griggs was sold.
    He bought the drug, changed its name (ADD for All: Adderall) and began marketing
    it at scale with his company Richwood. By the middle of 1994, just a few months

    Jones博士。Griggs计划拜访他。在Provo的午餐会上，这位有进取心的医生报告说，他一直在给无法耐受利他林的ADHD儿童开Obetrol。他声称，结果非常显著。Griggs被说服了。他买下了这种药物，改名为（ADD

    right to manufacture a combination of peanut butter and jelly. The drug’s chemical
    makeup and subjective effects were functionally indistinguishable from Dexedrine,
    which had lost its patent decades ago. Had Adderall been submitted as a completely

    Richwood a reason to get as many people as possible hooked on amphetamines. If
    Adderall’s pushers have since evaded Sackler-style comeuppance, this can be largely
    attributed to the fact that it’s basically impossible to fatally overdose on it.

    Psychiatric Association had coined the ADHD diagnosis to explain why children
    were failing to get hooked on phonics. The problem was not, in fact, that the
    kids were “hyperkinetic” (aka that they couldn’t sit still), but that they suffered
    from a neurological incapacity to pay *attention*. By the time ADHD reached quinceañera
    age, an entire generation of well-insured children had been diagnosed—via tests

    crisis, then came the diagnosis that described it as a medical problem, and last
    came the Adderall boom that was supposed to fix it. By these lights, if Adderall
    isn’t fixing the attention crisis, it’s because we are trying to cure a non-medical
    problem (e.g. the natural exuberance of children, or the infrastructural fact
    of smartphones) with a drug. This analysis fails to grasp the full extent of the
    problem. It’s not just that we are drugging something that can’t be solved with

    that it works by increasing the neurochemical signal that makes you want to keep

    an activity is better or worse than expected: for example, if you get two gumballs
    from the machine when you expected to only get one, the physiology of the resulting
    jackpot thrill is caused by increased dopamine signaling. Any drug that floods
    the brain with dopamine will render the user hyper-vulnerable to getting stuck
    in repetitive behavioral loops, especially when the reward is unpredictable (the
    technical term is “variable reward.”) This is why gumball machines aren’t addictive
    and slot machines are. Amphetamines work by turning whatever you’re doing into
    a slot machine. If the Internet is the giant casino in which we are all now imprisoned,

- en: The connection between amphetamines and digital behavioral loops is perhaps
    best illuminated by what psychiatrist Gosta Rylander first described as “punding”
    in 1970\. “The patient becomes obsessed with an activity that, while harmless
    on its own terms, comes to consume their life,” he wrote. “They become irritable
    whenever someone distracts them from their preferred behavioral loop.” Current
    clinical literature describes punding as “non-goal oriented, repetitive activity
    such as manipulation of technical equipment, handling, examining or sorting through
    objects, grooming, or hoarding.” These activities offer a soothing flow state
    reinforced by periodic reward, balancing undemanding stimulation with endless
    repeatability. “Repetitive Reward Seeking Behavior” syndromes of this kind tend
    to be observed in people who are taking drugs that flood their central nervous
    system with dopamine, and are most frequently observed in Parkinson’s patients
    being treated with dopamine replacement therapy, and amphetamine users.

    looking at me strangely, like he suspected there might be a problem. One evening,

    research binge into the provenance of street Adderall. Incidentally, this is how
    I found out about the shortage. Apparently, pharmacies across America had run
    out of the precious drug for mysterious reasons, and drug dealers had responded
    by simply making their own, replacing the active ingredient with meth and a bit
    of caffeine. That explained a whole lot.
