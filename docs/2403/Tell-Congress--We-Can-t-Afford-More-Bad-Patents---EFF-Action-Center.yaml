- en: Patent trolls—companies that have no product or service of their own, but simply
    make patent infringement demands on others—are a big problem. They’ve cost our
    economy billions of dollars. For a small company, a patent troll demand letter
    can be ruinous.

- en: We took a big step towards fighting off patent trolls in 2014, when a landmark
    Supreme Court ruling, the Alice Corp. v. CLS Bank case, established that you can’t
    get a patent by adding “on a computer” to an abstract idea. In 2012, Congress
    also expanded the ways that a patent can be challenged at the patent office.

- en: These two bills, PERA and PREVAIL, would roll back both of those critical protections
    against patent trolls. We know that the bill sponsors, Sens. Thom Tillis (R-NC)
    and Chris Coons (D-DE) are pushing hard for these bills to move forward. We need
    your help to tell Congress that it’s the wrong move.
