- en: I have so many feelings about mustard I don‚Äôt even know where to start. It‚Äôs
    my favorite color (marigold, mustard yellow, same difference). I‚Äôm from Chicago.
    I love hot dogs. If you don‚Äôt understand, google ‚Äúchicago ketchup‚Äù. I blow through
    jars of dijon like it‚Äôs nobody‚Äôs business because can you even make a good salad
    dressing without it? Just last week, I went to a [German restaurant](https://www.facebook.com/gunkhaus/)
    and ordered a plate-sized chicken schnitzel that was more or less a vessel for
    eating their incredible mustards (one sweet, one spicy). All to say, it‚Äôs a perfect
    condiment and it doesn‚Äôt get the love and respect it deserves. And let me tell
    you, the Mustard Rabbit Hole did not disappoint. The packaging is so inspiring
    and sincere, and I‚Äôm this close to booking a flight to Europe so I can buy some
    mustard in a tube (more on that below). Anyways, please enjoy this deep dive into
    a product category that is seemingly untouched by trendy packaging design in the
    best way. But first‚Ä¶

    founded in 1747! I didn‚Äôt know just how old these legacy brands were until I started
    researching this letter, but after digging further it‚Äôs not all that surprising.
    Mustard as a spice is one of the earliest on record, appearing in Sanskrit manuscripts
    around [3000 BCE](https://www.thespruceeats.com/history-of-mustard-as-food-1807631),
    and mustard as a condiment dates back to the early Romans. I‚Äôd love to see how
    they were storing this colorful condiment back then, but I‚Äôm quite pleased with
    how these brands are jarring it today. Per usual, this is one of my favorite categories
    in this deep dive because of that whole ‚Äútimeless cool‚Äù thing that always wins
    for me when it comes to packaging design. Side note, I‚Äôm now obsessed with [vintage
    mustard pots](https://www.ebay.com/itm/116049108645?hash=item1b0510dea5:g:0LIAAOSwEZtlsWnS&amdata=enc%3AAQAIAAAA4Do618SinNeb0oukHLW7hF98hkXq1ZXA9id3CjPJljvUwthF65DYiJ6LV900JtSUnCM234bS5SrL2b8imBaY8lj5VuNGaebGKsSN3fzpi%2BJHxaNlvm%2Fdp6WxKzcENxXbboYQfhupLsycEoKSGFv894itaCL1YjNjVpKfw8io71ccQY3n%2Bu%2FYBl5rfE0BckgDDYx8N5v5IHTY%2FtLg1jpgJExY8i%2B89HFAotjdaRq%2FwFHD0xO%2BdHWFK7uGYwb4QqGh7AR%2BipKEKiNXP1XTqq68l5Fvi9xWP6W0q8TdZu1OUE5L%7Ctkp%3ABk9SR8Lx7Z-vYw).

    photo of a fixer-upper kitchen remodel in Domino. Or any number of recent brands
    that have been bringing back that avocado green and orange/yellow palette. All
    to say, these bottles and jars look like they could be set pieces on The Brady
    Bunch or That ‚Äò70s Show. And because apparently mustard brands can do no wrong,
    these are all working. They don‚Äôt feel try-hard or overly designed, but rather
    truly feel like they time traveled 50 years to the future. I especially love that
    top left bottle of Finnish mustard and the type on Mister Mustard. Also, Mustard
    Girl would be a great Halloween costume.

    juice or crunchy peanut butter? Just a thought. Like I said above, I‚Äôm from Chicago,
    so these sorts of classic yellow mustards have a time and a place, and that time
    and place is on a hot dog [dragged through the garden](https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/4ln2ua/a_chicago_style_hot_dog_dragged_through_the_garden/).
    You probably recognize those three bottles up top‚Äìespecially the top right if
    you, too, are from Chicago. Fun fact: Plochman‚Äôs factory survived the Great Chicago
    Fire in 1871\. Unlike [ketchup](https://chloelist.substack.com/p/issue-04-ketchup),
    there‚Äôs more variety in the squeeze bottle department too. The label designs on
    these are nothing special, but they don‚Äôt need to be. Now that I know so many
    of the legacy brands are French, the fact that French‚Äôs is called ‚ÄúFrench‚Äôs‚Äù and
    describes itself as ‚ÄúAmerican flavor in a bottle‚Äù is kind of funny (and American).'

    saying much. The color speaks for itself! If you‚Äôre not going to go all old world
    style as a mustard brand, I like this approach. Bonus points for Ikea putting
    a hot dog illo on their bottle. It feels right that their ketchup bottle has a
    tomato on it, and their mustard bottle has that instead of a mustard plant.
