- en: Ultra Librarian is the biggest name in the electronic components sector, boasting
    a repository of millions of parts from diverse manufacturers. Their commitment
    to maintaining an up-to-date and accessible library for PCB designers aligns perfectly
    with our goal to offer an efficient, user-friendly design experience. With Ultra
    Librarian providing access to the world’s largest online electronic component
    CAD library, Flux users are assured virtually unlimited access to any component
    they might need, directly published and accessible in real-time within the Flux
    platform.

    Systems (MPS), a leader in all things related to power and semiconductors. Users
    will now have access to over 3,500 of the company’s parts for immediate use in
    their designs, as well as MPS-created reference designs for inspiration. To use
    MPS’s parts, simply search for Monolithic Power Systems in the component library
    and drop them onto your canvas.
