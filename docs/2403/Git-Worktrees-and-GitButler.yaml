    style tips. One of the things I covered in this new talk was `git worktree` and
    since I've heard it mentioned a lot lately, I thought it was time to do a little
    writeup explaining it.

    you (üôÑ, bosses, right?) and says "we need this bug fixed". Or maybe you just notice
    the bug as you're working. Whatever it is, you need to switch contexts while in
    the middle of something.

    decide that we want to work on a new branch called `bugfix-123`. We can run the

    branch into.

    have our own mapping of which changes are owned by which branch. Then when you
    hit the "commit" button, we run a sort of `git apply` of those changes to what
    you started with.

    here and commit and push that, but then doing the same for the second file would
    require us to reset and then add the other and then change the active branch and
    commit, etc. It's not simple.

    applied that have conflicting work. You can't have conflicts if you have one copy
    of each file.

    nice. Essentially you're starting with the merged product and then extracting
    branches out of it.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For instance, lets say that both the `french` and the `spanish` branches are
    eventually merged. It doesn't matter what order they're merged in, we know they
    will not only merge cleanly, but we know that when they do both get merged, what
    we'll end up with is the state of the working directory *when we started*.
