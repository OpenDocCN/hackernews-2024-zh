- en: Jim Bueermann, president of the think tank Future Policing and a former police
    chief in San Bernardino, California, said car theft is a tricky issue for police.
    On the one hand, a car is just a “piece of tin” and not worth putting lives in
    danger over. On the other hand, people often depend on their cars for their livelihoods,
    making them far more important than something like a television. “Technology holds
    the promise of solving this problem,” he said.

    are deliberately creating traffic jams to box in a car that license plate readers
    identified as stolen. It’s a tactic known as a “mitigation plan.”

    closing one lane so there’s no place for that car. So each time it’s a little
