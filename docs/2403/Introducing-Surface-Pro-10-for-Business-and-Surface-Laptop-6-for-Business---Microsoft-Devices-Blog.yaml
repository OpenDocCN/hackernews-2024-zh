    Surface Pro 10 for Business and Surface Laptop 6 for Business. These new PCs represent
    a major step forward in customer-focused design and are packed with features that
    business customers have been requesting – from amazing performance and battery
    life to more ports, better security and custom, durable anti-reflective displays.
    These are the first Surface PCs optimized for AI, with the new Copilot key being
    added to Surface Laptop 6 and Surface Pro keyboards that accelerate access to
    the best Windows AI experiences¹. In addition to the new Surface for Business
    products, we are pleased to announce the Microsoft Adaptive Accessories will now
    be available to commercial customers.'

    with Intel to deliver the power and reliable performance our customers depend
    on, along with compelling AI experiences for Surface and the Windows ecosystem.
    Surface has also been leading in Neural Processing Unit (NPU) integration to drive
    AI experiences on the PC since 2019, and the benefits of these connected efforts
    are evident. From a performance perspective, Surface Laptop 6 is 2x faster than
    Laptop 5², and Surface Pro 10 is up to 53% faster than Pro 9\. The benefits of
    the NPU integration include AI features like Windows Studio Effects and Live Captions³
    and the opportunity for businesses and developers to build their own AI apps and
    experiences.

    is designed for teams that need a no-compromise device. It is our most powerful
    Surface Pro ever powered by Intel Core Ultra processors, and the first time we’re
    bringing 5G⁴ to the Intel platform. It brings a new level of productivity and
    versatility – whether used as a powerful tablet for frontline workers out in the
    field, a versatile laptop in the conference room, or anywhere in between – Surface
    Pro 10 adapts to our customers’ needs and to how they use technology.'

    Windows 11 Pro, Surface Pro 10 unlocks the ability to be more productive than
    ever before. We’ve added the Copilot key to all of our new Surface Pro keyboards,
    including a new version with a bold keyset⁵ with a larger font, high contrast
    and backlighting that make the keys more visible and easier for everyone to type.

    keyboard. They’re choosing Surface Pro to use with touch gestures, voice commands
    and even with handwritten prompts with Surface Slim Pen. With Surface Pro, they
    are able to use all these natural input methods to make it even easier to use
    Copilot. And in Microsoft 365 apps like OneNote, Copilot will be able to use AI
    to analyze handwritten notes, saving time and keeping them in their flow.

    Whether working under fluorescent office lighting or outside in the field, the
    display looks incredible in almost any lighting condition. We’ve made it 33% brighter
    and with a higher contrast ratio and have added a custom designed durable anti-reflective
    coating, all without making any sacrifices to the experience when using it with
    touch, and pen.

    Studio Camera that is the best front-facing camera that has ever been put into
    a Windows 2-in-1 or laptop. It’s the first Windows PC with a 114° field of view,
    captures video in 1440p, and uses AI-powered Windows Studio Effects to ensure
    that the speaker is in frame and looking their best during video calls.

    typing experience that is designed for quality, and confidence. Every element
    of the keyboard has been considered to ensure productivity when typing, with nothing
    to get in the way of self-expression. Also, the new Copilot key on Surface Laptop
    6 makes accessing the power of AI even easier, with a quick button press to invoke
    Copilot in Windows¹ to help customers to plan their day, find a document using
    natural text, analyze a website and more with commercial data protection built

    without having to navigate to settings in Windows. Live captions³ are now even
    better on these new products as the processing for this feature is offloaded to
    the NPU so the system operates with greater efficiency, freeing up the CPU and
    GPU to run other demanding applications.

    zero waste by 2030\. This commitment means that we are constantly working to advance
    the sustainability of our products, and we know that many of our customers are
    also pursuing their own ambitious sustainability goals. Surface Laptop 6 and Surface
    Pro 10 contain the most recycled content that we’ve ever put into our PCs with
    the Surface Laptop 6 enclosure being made with a minimum of 25.8% recycled content
    and the enclosure on Surface Pro 10 being made with a minimum of 72% recycled
    content⁶. Both devices are even easier to service and repair with built-in QR
    codes that provide convenient access to service guides. In Surface Pro 10 we’ve
    also included internal markings that identify the number of screws and driver
    types needed for key components. This increased device repairability can offer
    significant carbon emissions and waste reduction benefits⁷. We are also making
    trade-in more convenient and secure for our commercial customers in the U.S. to
    help limit device waste.
