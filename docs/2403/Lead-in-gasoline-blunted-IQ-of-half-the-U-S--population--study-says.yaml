    and the 1970s, when leaded gas consumption was skyrocketing, the IQ loss was estimated
    to be up to 6 points and for some, more than 7 points. Exposure to it came primarily
    from inhaling auto exhaust.

    other data to calculate that as of 2015, more than 170 million Americans had had
    blood lead levels above 5 micrograms per deciliter in their early childhood years.

    per deciliter is the reference value for blood lead levels to be considered [high](https://www.cdc.gov/nceh/lead/prevention/blood-lead-levels.htm);
    the acceptable amount was once higher.

    could have large consequences, said Sung Kyun Park, an associate professor of
    epidemiology and environmental health sciences at the University of Michigan School
    of Public Health. The entire bell curve shifts, he explained, with more of the
    population at what was once the extreme low end of IQ scores.

    safer additives replaced it. In addition to being linked to lower IQs, it has
    also been associated with heart and [kidney disease](https://www.kidney.org/atoz/content/lead-exposure-and-kidney-function#:~:text=Most%20lead%2Drelated%20kidney%20disease,is%20stored%20in%20the%20bones.).

    poisonous effects. Children’s blood lead levels have been dramatically lowered

    adults under age 45 experienced “considerably higher” levels of blood lead levels
    in early life than their white counterparts.

    said.
