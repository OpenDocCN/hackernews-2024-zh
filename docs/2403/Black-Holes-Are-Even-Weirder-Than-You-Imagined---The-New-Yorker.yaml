    If a rainbow is marvellous, then understanding how all the colors of the rainbow
    are present, unified, in ordinary white light—that’s more marvellous. (Though,
    famously, in his poem “Lamia,” John Keats disagreed, blaming “cold philosophy”
    for unweaving the rainbow.) In recent years, the amount of data that scientists
    have discovered about black holes has grown exponentially. In January, astronomers
    announced that the [James Webb Space Telescope](https://www.newyorker.com/news/the-new-yorker-interview/what-the-webb-space-telescope-will-show-us-next)
    had observed the oldest black hole yet—one present when the universe was a mere
    four hundred million years old. (It’s estimated that it’s now 13.8 billion years
    old.) Recently, two supermassive black holes, with a combined mass of twenty-eight
    billion suns, were measured and shown to have been rotating tightly around each
    other, but not colliding, for the past three billion years. And those are just
    the examples that are easiest for the public to make some sense of. To me, a supermassive
    black hole sounds sublime; to a scientist, it can also be a test of wild hypotheses.
    “Astrophysics is an exercise in incredible experiments not runnable on Earth,”
    Avery Broderick, a theoretical physicist at the University of Waterloo and at
    the Perimeter Institute, told me. “And black holes are an ideal laboratory.”

- en: Broderick says that he studies black holes because they are very simple, theoretically
    and mathematically. As he explained it, a black hole has a mass, an electrical
    charge, and an angular momentum (meaning that it can spin). “And that’s pretty
    much it,” he said. “Their behavior is extreme, but the apparatus is something
    we think we understand.” Another “simple” way to think of a black hole is as an
    extraordinary amount of mass in a relatively small space. It exerts a gravitational
    pull so strong that not even light can escape it. Imagine the mass of Earth condensed
    to the volume of a marble; imagine a million suns condensed to the volume of a
    single sun—that’ll give you an idea of a black hole. Some black holes are formed
    by stars that have collapsed in on themselves. Other black holes are thought to
    have been formed by the inward collapse of enormous clouds of gas. (There are
    other theories, too.) To look “into” a black hole—from which no photon or wave
    or ray ever returns—requires considerable creativity. The interior of a black
    hole can only be deduced from changes exterior to it. Active black holes are encircled
    by intense brightness and billion-degree heat, given off by matter falling toward
    them—think of the fire of an incoming asteroid—while the black hole itself is
    unthinkably cold, a tiny fraction of a degree above absolute zero.

- en: It’s in these simple, outlandish objects, Broderick explained, “that twentieth-century
    physics breaks down.” But what is the twentieth-century physics that is said to
    break down? Basically, there’s [Albert Einstein’s theory of general relativity](https://www.newyorker.com/tech/annals-of-technology/the-space-doctors-big-idea-einstein-general-relativity)
    (which made a tiny but far-reaching correction to Isaac Newton’s concept of gravity),
    and there’s quantum mechanics. “General relativity is thought of as the theory
    of the very large and massive, and quantum mechanics is the theory of the very
    small or very cold,” Broderick said. Black holes are massive (general relativity),
    and cold (quantum mechanics). But, when scientists attempt to use these theories
    to describe what happens in the interior of a black hole, the implications are,
    as another astrophysicist put it, “a disaster.” Or, as Broderick put it, the theories
    “give very different answers.”

    matter, the “plum pudding” model of the atom—these are more evocative than “eigenstates,”
    “neutron stars,” or “ribosomes.” “I had been searching for just the right term
    for months, mulling it over in bed, in the bathtub, in my car, wherever I had
    quiet moments,” the late physicist John Wheeler once said, about trying to find
    better language for what was then called a “gravitationally completely collapsed
    object.” Wheeler, who also read poetry, loved dreaming up vivid language for new
    concepts in physics. It is to Wheeler that we owe “wormholes,” the “participatory
    universe,” and “quantum foam”—names that carry something of the spirit of what
    they describe.

    recent discovery of pulsars—celestial objects that flash out radiation. The discussion
    centered on what caused this curious phenomenon. A “completely collapsed object”
    was one explanation. When Wheeler spoke, he used that cumbersome term several
    times before finding himself simply saying “black hole.” The name stuck. (That,
    anyhow, is one of the origin stories—the term had been used in articles a few
    years earlier, and it is also said to have been shouted out as a suggestion to
    Wheeler by a conference attendee.)

    Saul Perlmutter termed “the Darth Vader aspect” of black holes: the objects are
    “deadly, silent, all-powerful, and looming.” The popular understanding of black
    holes, though not precise, has the accuracy that we associate with the poetry
    that Wheeler loved to read. “Not only does it swallow anything that comes too
    near it but no one lives to tell the tale . . . there are footprints leading in,
    and no footprints leading out,” Perlmutter said, describing how nonspecialists
    might think of them. “If black holes weren’t real, I think the science-fiction
    writers would have wanted to invent them.”'

    even Einstein, who wrote the equations that predicted them. He said that they
    were impossible, a quirk of mathematics. In 1935, at a meeting of the Royal Astronomical
    Society, the young astrophysicist Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar presented his work,
    which suggested, instead, that what was impossible was essentially that black
    holes *didn’t* exist. Sir Arthur Eddington, one of the most respected elders of
    astronomy, had arranged Chandrasekhar’s talk and knew what he was going to speak
    about—and he scheduled himself to speak directly afterward. Eddington, who was
    polite, open-minded, and encouraging to younger scientists, dismissed Chandrasekhar’s
    idea as ludicrous, saying, “There should be a law of nature to prevent a star
    from behaving in this absurd way!” Eddington’s viewpoint won; talking about stellar
    collapse became a great way not to be taken seriously.

    something at the center of galaxies so bright that it outshone all the other stars
    in the galaxy put together. (This was the energy from things falling into a black
    hole.) Elsewhere, cosmic rays were detected from a part of the sky termed Cygnus
    X-1, in a pattern that seemed inexplicable. Ultimately, the concept of black holes
    came to account for and unify these baffling and seemingly disparate observations.
    Denying the existence of black holes became more awkward than accepting it. In
    the nineteen-seventies, [Stephen Hawking](https://www.newyorker.com/tech/annals-of-technology/stephen-hawking-was-a-living-metaphor-for-the-scientific-endeavor)
    had made a bet with Kip Thorne, a fellow-physicist, about whether the cosmic X
    rays coming from Cygnus X-1 could really be the result of a black hole. Hawking
    bet No, though he made the wager to counterbalance the outcome that he wanted
    to be true; he had spent years studying black holes. Only in 1990 had enough evidence
    accumulated to settle the bet in Thorne’s favor. (The payout was a subscription
    to *Penthouse*; if Hawking had won, he would have received the satirical magazine
    *Private Eye*.)

    one was at the center of our galaxy—actually, at the center of every galaxy—actually,
    not only at the center of galaxies but all over them, with our Milky Way alone
    housing many millions. And not only are there unthinkable numbers of black holes
    but sometimes they collide, sending tiny ripples of gravitational waves across
    the universe. In 2015, scientists at *LIGO*, an observatory whose construction
    had taken decades of dreaming and designing and revising, ran an experiment that
    within days detected those gravitational waves. The researchers described what
    they observed, evocatively, as ripples in the fabric of space-time.

- en: The gravitational waves sent out by colliding black holes make a sound—or translate
    into a sound—something like a bell being rung. “You can tell if I’m pounding on
    this desk, or if I’m pounding on the floor,” Will Farr, an astrophysicist, said
    to me in his bright office at the Flatiron Institute, in Manhattan. “If I had
    musical instruments, it would sound prettier, but also you could tell if it was
    a trumpet or a trombone or drums or a clarinet—even when they’re making the same
    note.”

- en: The sound made when you strike an object—or pull a bow across it, or blow air
    into a reed connected to it—carries information about the object’s shape, material
    makeup, and temperature. “You can identify an instrument by listening to what
    we call the spectrum—the different frequencies of the modes that are excited when
    you hit it,” Farr said. Black holes have modes, too, though they radiate in gravitational
    waves, not sound waves. So if you, say, pounded on a black hole, in theory, you
    could tell quite a bit about it. Two black holes colliding in effect do that pounding
    which scientists cannot themselves do—an experiment out in the cosmos.

- en: 'Farr described the moment of collision between two holes as forming a shape
    like a “black peanut,” which eventually settles into a single, merged black hole.
    “Ringdown” is the term used to describe both that final merging and the “sound”—the
    waves—emitted by it. The ripples from a ringdown, if recorded precisely enough,
    could tell the story of a black hole: its spin, its mass, and its charge, and
    possibly information about the million-degree hot-gas ring external to it. “Basically,
    there’s currently no other way to probe this region of space-time except with
    gravitational waves,” Farr said. Light waves, radio waves, X rays—none of these
    ways of reading the universe let scientists see as far down toward the horizon
    of a black hole. “That’s one reason why it’s been revolutionary to have this tool.”'

- en: Ringdown may be used by researchers to test if general relativity accurately
    describes black holes. If it does, then the ringdown tones will come out one way;
    if not, then they won’t. “By examining the deviations in detail, tone by tone,
    you can try to understand *where* the deviation from general relativity is coming,”
    Farr said.

    for how black holes do or don’t unify quantum mechanics and general relativity.
    But those ideas still filter into the public imagination, however fuzzily. In
    2020, the astrophysicist Andrea Ghez, of the University of California, Los Angeles,
    and a colleague received a Nobel for having tracked the path of objects near the
    center of our galaxy in sufficient detail to indicate that there must be a supermassive
    black hole there. In 2014, through an ingenious and sparsely funded passion project
    conducted by hundreds of scientists, the Event Horizon Telescope (E.H.T.) was
    assembled, with the goal of “photographing” a black hole. The E.H.T. is not one
    telescope but a network of initially eight and now eleven, spread across the planet.
    Together, the telescopes function as if they were one telescope with a lens the
    size of Earth. The E.H.T. gathered data on a distant black hole and then on a
    nearer one at the heart of the Milky Way. Images came through of the two black
    holes—or, rather, of the ring of stuff falling into the black holes.

    into astonishing images that were published all around the world. Because what
    the telescopes “saw” is at wavelengths outside the spectrum visible to the human
    eye, E.H.T. scientists made decisions about, for example, what color to use to
    depict the extreme heat of the plasma around the event horizon. (Even though blue
    flames are hotter than orange-red ones, they chose an orange-red color.) A number
    of scientists I spoke with about the images were gently indifferent, saying that
    they didn’t add to their fundamental understanding of black holes. Most were more
    impressed with the creative means of collecting the data than with the images
    themselves. (In contrast, for a certain crowd, the waveform that appeared when
    *LIGO* detected gravitational waves is a popular tattoo.) For other earthlings,
    that darkness, surrounded by its burning ring of fire, had the intimate quality
    of a Polaroid—but one of the alien that we call our universe.

    told me that, for scientists, the adage “seeing is believing” doesn’t always hold
    true; scientists often have to decide if they can trust what they see. He framed
    the E.H.T. as contributing both societal impact and scientific impact. It was
    “pleasingly novel to work on something I can tell my in-laws and mother about,”
    he said. He pointed out that it was estimated that half the world’s population
    had seen the first black-hole image: “I’m actually kind of curious; when was the
    last time so many newspapers had the same thing on their front page? We all shared
    this experience together, and there are precious few such things, and most of
    them are negative.” He saw the E.H.T. as a chance to make part of the story of
    physics real and visible.'

    he said, with his father, whom he would visit in the summer and on holidays. “He
    would record these movies and shows in anticipation of me coming, so we would
    binge-watch before it was a thing,” he said. His father was quadriplegic, and
    enjoyed photography and movies. Broderick told me that his viewing of “Star Trek”
    is not unrelated to his work as a theoretical physicist. In every episode, he
    said, the Starfleet travelled to incredible new places, and saw something different,
    and *that* was the adventure. “A part of what drew me to astrophysics was that
    Starfleet doesn’t exist. But I get to travel the universe with telescopes, large
    computers, blackboards, whiteboards, chalk—with whatever.” ♦
