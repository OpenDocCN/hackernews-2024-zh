    If a rainbow is marvellous, then understanding how all the colors of the rainbow
    are present, unified, in ordinary white light—that’s more marvellous. (Though,
    famously, in his poem “Lamia,” John Keats disagreed, blaming “cold philosophy”
    for unweaving the rainbow.) In recent years, the amount of data that scientists
    have discovered about black holes has grown exponentially. In January, astronomers
    announced that the [James Webb Space Telescope](https://www.newyorker.com/news/the-new-yorker-interview/what-the-webb-space-telescope-will-show-us-next)
    had observed the oldest black hole yet—one present when the universe was a mere
    four hundred million years old. (It’s estimated that it’s now 13.8 billion years
    old.) Recently, two supermassive black holes, with a combined mass of twenty-eight
    billion suns, were measured and shown to have been rotating tightly around each
    other, but not colliding, for the past three billion years. And those are just
    the examples that are easiest for the public to make some sense of. To me, a supermassive
    black hole sounds sublime; to a scientist, it can also be a test of wild hypotheses.
    “Astrophysics is an exercise in incredible experiments not runnable on Earth,”
    Avery Broderick, a theoretical physicist at the University of Waterloo and at
    the Perimeter Institute, told me. “And black holes are an ideal laboratory.”

- en: Broderick says that he studies black holes because they are very simple, theoretically
    and mathematically. As he explained it, a black hole has a mass, an electrical
    charge, and an angular momentum (meaning that it can spin). “And that’s pretty
    much it,” he said. “Their behavior is extreme, but the apparatus is something
    we think we understand.” Another “simple” way to think of a black hole is as an
    extraordinary amount of mass in a relatively small space. It exerts a gravitational
    pull so strong that not even light can escape it. Imagine the mass of Earth condensed
    to the volume of a marble; imagine a million suns condensed to the volume of a
    single sun—that’ll give you an idea of a black hole. Some black holes are formed
    by stars that have collapsed in on themselves. Other black holes are thought to
    have been formed by the inward collapse of enormous clouds of gas. (There are
    other theories, too.) To look “into” a black hole—from which no photon or wave
    or ray ever returns—requires considerable creativity. The interior of a black
    hole can only be deduced from changes exterior to it. Active black holes are encircled
    by intense brightness and billion-degree heat, given off by matter falling toward
    them—think of the fire of an incoming asteroid—while the black hole itself is
    unthinkably cold, a tiny fraction of a degree above absolute zero.

  zh: Broderick说他研究黑洞是因为从理论和数学角度来看，它们非常简单。正如他所解释的，一个黑洞有质量、电荷和角动量（即它可以旋转）。他说：“基本上就是这样。”“它们的行为是极端的，但我们认为我们理解它们的装置是一些我们认为我们理解的。”另一种“简单”的看法是把黑洞想象成一个非常大的质量在相对较小的空间内。它产生如此强大的引力，以至于连光都无法逃脱。想象一下地球的质量压缩到大理石的体积；想象一百万个太阳的质量压缩到单个太阳的体积——这会给你一个黑洞的概念。一些黑洞是由塌缩成星的恒星形成的。其他黑洞据信是由巨大的气云向内坍缩形成的。（还有其他理论。）要“看”一个黑洞——从中任何光子、波或射线都永远不会返回的地方——需要相当的创造力。黑洞的内部只能通过其外部的变化推断出来。活跃的黑洞被强烈的亮度和数十亿度的热量所包围，这些都是由向它们坠落的物质释放出来的——想象一下一颗即将来临的小行星的火焰——而黑洞本身是无法想象的寒冷，远低于绝对零度的微小分数。
- en: It’s in these simple, outlandish objects, Broderick explained, “that twentieth-century
    physics breaks down.” But what is the twentieth-century physics that is said to
    break down? Basically, there’s [Albert Einstein’s theory of general relativity](https://www.newyorker.com/tech/annals-of-technology/the-space-doctors-big-idea-einstein-general-relativity)
    (which made a tiny but far-reaching correction to Isaac Newton’s concept of gravity),
    and there’s quantum mechanics. “General relativity is thought of as the theory
    of the very large and massive, and quantum mechanics is the theory of the very
    small or very cold,” Broderick said. Black holes are massive (general relativity),
    and cold (quantum mechanics). But, when scientists attempt to use these theories
    to describe what happens in the interior of a black hole, the implications are,
    as another astrophysicist put it, “a disaster.” Or, as Broderick put it, the theories
    “give very different answers.”

- en: Some scientific terms have more charisma than others. Schrödinger’s cat, dark
    matter, the “plum pudding” model of the atom—these are more evocative than “eigenstates,”
    “neutron stars,” or “ribosomes.” “I had been searching for just the right term
    for months, mulling it over in bed, in the bathtub, in my car, wherever I had
    quiet moments,” the late physicist John Wheeler once said, about trying to find
    better language for what was then called a “gravitationally completely collapsed
    object.” Wheeler, who also read poetry, loved dreaming up vivid language for new
    concepts in physics. It is to Wheeler that we owe “wormholes,” the “participatory
    universe,” and “quantum foam”—names that carry something of the spirit of what
    they describe.

    recent discovery of pulsars—celestial objects that flash out radiation. The discussion
    centered on what caused this curious phenomenon. A “completely collapsed object”
    was one explanation. When Wheeler spoke, he used that cumbersome term several
    times before finding himself simply saying “black hole.” The name stuck. (That,
    anyhow, is one of the origin stories—the term had been used in articles a few
    years earlier, and it is also said to have been shouted out as a suggestion to
    Wheeler by a conference attendee.)

    were impossible, a quirk of mathematics. In 1935, at a meeting of the Royal Astronomical
    Society, the young astrophysicist Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar presented his work,
    which suggested, instead, that what was impossible was essentially that black
    holes *didn’t* exist. Sir Arthur Eddington, one of the most respected elders of
    astronomy, had arranged Chandrasekhar’s talk and knew what he was going to speak
    about—and he scheduled himself to speak directly afterward. Eddington, who was
    polite, open-minded, and encouraging to younger scientists, dismissed Chandrasekhar’s
    idea as ludicrous, saying, “There should be a law of nature to prevent a star
    from behaving in this absurd way!” Eddington’s viewpoint won; talking about stellar
    collapse became a great way not to be taken seriously.

- en: Decades passed. Then a few weird things were noticed. Astronomers began seeing
    something at the center of galaxies so bright that it outshone all the other stars
    in the galaxy put together. (This was the energy from things falling into a black
    hole.) Elsewhere, cosmic rays were detected from a part of the sky termed Cygnus
    X-1, in a pattern that seemed inexplicable. Ultimately, the concept of black holes
    came to account for and unify these baffling and seemingly disparate observations.
    Denying the existence of black holes became more awkward than accepting it. In
    the nineteen-seventies, [Stephen Hawking](https://www.newyorker.com/tech/annals-of-technology/stephen-hawking-was-a-living-metaphor-for-the-scientific-endeavor)

    rays coming from Cygnus X-1 could really be the result of a black hole. Hawking
    bet No, though he made the wager to counterbalance the outcome that he wanted
    to be true; he had spent years studying black holes. Only in 1990 had enough evidence
    accumulated to settle the bet in Thorne’s favor. (The payout was a subscription

    to me in his bright office at the Flatiron Institute, in Manhattan. “If I had

    makeup, and temperature. “You can identify an instrument by listening to what
    we call the spectrum—the different frequencies of the modes that are excited when
    you hit it,” Farr said. Black holes have modes, too, though they radiate in gravitational
    waves, not sound waves. So if you, say, pounded on a black hole, in theory, you
    could tell quite a bit about it. Two black holes colliding in effect do that pounding

    waves—emitted by it. The ripples from a ringdown, if recorded precisely enough,
    could tell the story of a black hole: its spin, its mass, and its charge, and
    possibly information about the million-degree hot-gas ring external to it. “Basically,
    there’s currently no other way to probe this region of space-time except with
    gravitational waves,” Farr said. Light waves, radio waves, X rays—none of these

    said, the Starfleet travelled to incredible new places, and saw something different,
    and *that* was the adventure. “A part of what drew me to astrophysics was that
    Starfleet doesn’t exist. But I get to travel the universe with telescopes, large
    computers, blackboards, whiteboards, chalk—with whatever.” ♦

  zh: 作为一个孩子，Broderick和他的父亲一起看“星际迷航”，“神秘博士”，以及“任何冒险的东西”，他说，在夏天和假期里他会去看望父亲。“他会预先录下这些电影和节目，以便我来了我们就可以一口气看完，这在当时还不是一件常见的事情，”他说。他的父亲是四肢瘫痪患者，喜欢摄影和电影。Broderick告诉我，他看“星际迷航”并不无关紧要，与他作为理论物理学家的工作有些关联。他说，在每一集中，星际舰队都去了不可思议的新地方，看到了不同的东西，*这*才是冒险的精髓。“吸引我去天体物理学的一部分原因是星际舰队并不存在。但是我可以通过望远镜、大型计算机、黑板、白板、粉笔——用任何工具——去探索宇宙。”
