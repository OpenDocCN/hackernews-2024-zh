    in one centralized database. Swampy knew he was caught in a prisoner’s dilemma.

    the average seniority of managers across various programs that found that greener
    workforces were substantially less productive, which he found to be a “mirror
    image” of a kind of “rule of thumb” within Boeing that held that every Boeing
    employee takes four years to become “fully productive.” But the average employee
    assigned to the 737 program has been at Boeing just five years, according to a
    longtime Boeing executive who is involved in various efforts to save the company;
    for comparison’s sake, he says the average employee assigned to the 777 program
    had between 15 and 20 years under their belt. The typical engineer or machinist
    assigned to the task of fixing Boeing’s 20,000 problems has never known a Boeing
    that wasn’t a five-alarm dumpster fire.

  zh: 多年来，Sorscher已经警告波音管理层其“才智之战”对公司的灾难性影响。他表示，麦道公司的经理们在1997年发表了一项针对各个项目的经理平均资历与生产力的统计分析，发现经验不足的劳动力生产力明显较低，他认为这与波音内部的一种“经验法则”是“镜像关系”，即每位波音员工需要四年时间才能“完全投入工作”。然而，根据参与多项挽救公司努力的资深波音高管称，分配给737项目的典型员工平均只在波音工作了五年；相比之下，他说分配给777项目的典型工程师或机械师已经有15至20年的工作经验。修复波音20000个问题的典型工程师或机械师从未经历过一个不是“五级火警垃圾场”的波音。

    “It’s a top-secret military contractor, remember; there are spies everywhere,”
    he replied. More importantly, he added, “there is a principle in American law
    that there is no such thing as an accidental death during the commission of a
    felony. Let’s say you rob a bank and while traveling at high speed in the getaway
    you run down a pedestrian and kill them. That’s second-degree murder at the very

    *暗杀* 了Swampy？他回答说：“这是一个顶级秘密的军事承包商，记住，到处都有间谍。” 更重要的是，他补充道：“美国法律有个原则，即在犯罪行为中不存在意外死亡。假设你抢银行，逃跑时高速行驶撞到行人并导致其死亡，那至少是二级谋杀。”
