    2011—helping to anoint the startup as a darling in New York tech circles. Soon
    after, Dixon joined Andreessen Horowitz, where he became enamored with blockchain,
    viewing the technology as a way to bring the internet back to its open-source
    roots. The firm would spin out a separate operation—a16z crypto—dedicated to blockchain
    investments in 2018.

    Horowitz），他对区块链情有独钟，认为这项技术可以将互联网带回其开源根源。该公司随后分拆出一个独立运营的部门——a16z加密，专门投资区块链项目，于2018年成立。

    its third fund—Dixon stayed in touch with Chen. According to a person familiar
    with the deal, members of the Kickstarter board, including Chen, approached Dixon
    in the summer of 2021 about a new investment in Kickstarter, with the proposed
    blockchain pivot offered as the impetus for the deal. For Dixon, the prospect
    of shepherding a familiar name like Kickstarter into the promised land of Web3
    proved too enticing to pass up.
