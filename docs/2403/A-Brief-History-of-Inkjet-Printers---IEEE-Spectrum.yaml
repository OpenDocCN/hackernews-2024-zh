    resolution of 96 dots per inch (dpi), as was typical for the first models in the
    1980s, the distance from dot center to dot center is a mere 260 micrometers. To
    fill a standard letter page that has 2.5-centimeter margins would require more
    than half a million individual ink droplets. Delivery of those tiny droplets involves
    moving them with very precise control, repeated a vast number of times as rapidly
    as possible. This process is ideally suited for [microelectromechanical systems
    (MEMS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MEMS), which are electronic devices with
    microscopic components that employ movement.

    in parallel, each one emitting up to 1,350 droplets per second, to print 150 alphanumeric
    characters per second. Today, a high-end inkjet printhead used in a commercial
    printing press may contain 21,000 nozzles, each nozzle printing 20,000 to 150,000
    dots per second. Each drop of ink may be just 1.5 picoliters—a picoliter is one-trillionth

    drop-on-demand inkjet printers, where each orifice on the printhead emits one
    drop of ink at a time, avoiding the waste of a continual flow of drops. Surface
    tension holds the ink in place in a tiny open nozzle until a mechanism pushes
    the ink to eject a drop. Each drop hitting the paper creates a dot, and moving
    the printhead back and forth builds up an image. A printhead with multiple orifices
    can emit many drops of ink simultaneously, so each pass of the printhead across
    the page adds a strip of the image, not just a single drop-thin line.

    began exploring what other kinds of “ink” might be delivered with an inkjet. One
    of these was Agilent Technologies, a spin-off of Hewlett Packard with a focus
    on life-science and chemical-analysis technologies. Agilent developed a way to
    print strands of DNA from the four nucleic acid bases—cytosine (C), guanine (G),
    adenine (A), and thymine (T). Specifically, the company adapted existing DNA chemistries
    plus inkjet printing techniques to build [microarrays of DNA](https://www.agilent.com/library/applications/5989-9159en_lo.pdf)
    on glass slides for [genomics work](https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/cmr.00019-09),
    such as measuring which genes are being expressed in an organism under various
    conditions. Academic researchers have shared open-source methods for [converting

    the commercial systems.

    regions called spots where DNA strands are attached. Agilent produces arrays with
    as many as a million spots on a single 2.5-by-7.6-cm slide. An open-source system
    puts up to 10,000 in a somewhat smaller area. Each DNA strand is made of sequences
    of the bases C, G, A, and T. In double-stranded DNA, the strands have complementary
    sequences, which join up like rungs of a ladder, C joining with G, and A with
    T.

    light up.

    in the microarray spots has a molecular “cap” at the end that prevents the indiscriminate
    addition of more bases. So the first step is to remove or deactivate those caps
    by washing a solution over the nascent microarray. The second step is analogous
    to printing a page: At each spot on the microarray, the inkjet adds a dot of liquid
    containing the next monomer molecule (modified versions of C, G, A, or T) to be
    added to the end of the strand. These monomers each include a new cap so that
    only one molecule gets added to each strand. Although the newly added monomers
    are now attached to the strands, the connection is not fully stable, and so the
    third step applies an oxidizer solution that modifies the bonds, fully integrating
    the new monomers into the DNA structure. Rinse and repeat.'

    it in the regions where the binding promoter is present. A fresh layer of powder
    is then spread over the entire printing area in readiness for the next cycle of
    the process. At the end, compressed air and a vacuum hose remove the unfused powder

    releasing or absorbing electrons that produce the current flow. The energy-storage
