- en: SEOUL, March 6 (Yonhap) -- A research team at the Korea Advanced Institute of
    Science and Technology (KAIST) has developed the world's first artificial intelligence
    (AI) semiconductor capable of processing a large language model (LLM) with ultra-low
    power consumption, the science ministry said Wednesday.

- en: The team, led by Professor Yoo Hoi-jun at the KAIST PIM Semiconductor Research
    Center, developed a "Complementary-Transformer" AI chip, which processes GPT-2
    with an ultra-low power consumption of 400 milliwatts and a high speed of 0.4
    seconds, according to the Ministry of Science and ICT.

    Co.'s 28 nanometer process, has 625 times less power consumption compared with
    global AI chip giant Nvidia's A-100 GPU, which requires 250 watts of power to
    process LLMs, the ministry explained.

- en: Previously, the technology was less accurate than deep neural networks (DNNs)
    and mainly capable of simple image classifications, but the research team succeeded
    in improving the accuracy of the technology to match that of DNNs to apply it
    to LLMs.

    maintaining accuracy by using unique neural network architecture that fuses DNNs
    and SNNs, and effectively compresses the large parameters of LLMs.
