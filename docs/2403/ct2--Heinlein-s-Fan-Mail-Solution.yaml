    editing at the Whole Earth Catalog. It is from the science fiction master [Robert
    Heinlein](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heinlein).

    how to deal with fan mail.  In the days before the internet, Heinlein’s solution
    was fabulous. He created a one page FAQ answer sheet –  minus the questions. Then
    he, or rather his wife Ginny, checked off the appropriate answer and mailed it
    back.  While getting a form letter back might be thought rude, it was much better
    than being ignored, and besides, the other questions you did not ask were also
    answered! Indeed, it is both remarkable and heartwarming that Heinlein replied
    at all to most mail. Can you imagine other great authors doing the same — even
    with a form letter? Heinlein’s form is very entertaining to read because you are
    forced to reconstruct the missing requests.'

    Heinlein said that by 1984, “with the advent of computerization in our household,
    we no long use the form letter to answer fan mail. I find that it is possible
    now, with the computer, to write individual letters in reply to fan mail faster
    than I could check off the answer on the form.”
