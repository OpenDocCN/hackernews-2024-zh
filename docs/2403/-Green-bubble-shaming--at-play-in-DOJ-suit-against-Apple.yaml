    with potential dates who had iPhones became a familiar and irksome ritual.

    and the first text I would get, not all the time, but certainly numerous times

    texts that iPhone users see when messaging his Android.'

- en: When someone with an Android texts an iMessage user, the quality of photos and
    videos is shoddy; you can't do live location tracking; you can't react to texts
    the same way; those suspense-building bouncing ellipses indicating someone is
    writing do not exist; and the conversation is less secure. To top it off, green
    bubbles lead to mockery.

    2013 email that allowing iMessage features to work for iPhone and non-Apple phones

    also known as SMS, to something called RCS, a new messaging standard that Google
    and other companies have already adopted.

    encryption. But Apple has long dismissed RCS in favor of its own proprietary messaging
    system, iMessage, arguing that any messaging system outside of the Apple ecosystem
    could put iPhone users' security and privacy at risk.

    the messaging system used by Androids so that location-sharing, typing indicators,
