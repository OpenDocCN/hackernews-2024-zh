    important roles in medical devices and other things, that it's almost impossible
    to envision a world where we move completely beyond plastic.

    that is more manageable with kind of recycling systems, getting rid of types of
    plastic that are especially hard to recycle, you can't recycle, being more transparent
    about what chemicals go into this stuff that again, make recycling hard, but it
    really does come down to when you talk to not just activists, but also businesses,
    increasingly, that regulation is going to play a big role.

    Johnson, A big consumer goods company, said something to the effect of we need
    government regulation. Businesses can't do this on their own.

    of this if companies don't have to deal with these costs. It's hard to imagine
    that they will in sort of a sustained way, create systems to deal with this if
    they don't have to.
