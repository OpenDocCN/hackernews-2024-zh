    If you want to call or send an SMS to this number, it‚Äôll cost *you* some money
    ‚Äî typically tens of cents ‚Äî and the owner of the number gets a portion of those
    tens of cents for themselves.

    money to supply and offer value to their users, such as tele-voting, dating, and

    Bob could be a hacker, or could be a mobile phone network operator gone bad.
  prefs: []

- en: Bob finds a web service that will send text messages to his premium phone numbers.
    These messages could be two-factor authentication codes, one time passwords, or
    any other text message sent to the user as part of the service (eg [partiful.com](http://partiful.com)
    sends event reminders via SMS).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Bob finds a way to make the service send *thousands* of SMSs to his premium
    phone numbers. This might be very easy. The front end service might be easy to
    manipulate, and the backend endpoints might be unprotected and easy to reverse-engineer.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'Even worse, many services use a standardised endpoint for sending SMSs. This
    makes it vastly easier to for Bob to find sites to attack. For example, if the
    service uses a third party for authenticating users and sending out 2FA or OTP
    codes, such as Auth0, then the endpoint for sending SMSs is mostly known: all
    Bob needs to do is to figure out a way to discover the Auth0‚Äôs ID for a web service
    (fairly easy, since the web service‚Äôs front-end makes a request containing this
    ID), and then they can attack *all* sites that use that third party service.'

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If using a third-party service to authenticate users, such as Auth0, you could
    obfuscate the endpoint used to send SMSs. Whilst this won‚Äôt prevent an attack
    outright, it does make it much harder to discover that an attack is possible.

    would move onto web services that are easier to hack. My hunch is that this approach
    would work for well enough for the [long tail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_tail)
    of apps.

    or are otherwise sketchy. This should be fairly simple to implement ‚Äî many services
    exist that allow you to rate the quality of an IP address ‚Äî and would probably
    be very effective.
  prefs:

- en: Add IP-based [rate-limiting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rate_limiting) to
    the endpoint that sends out SMS to block Bob‚Äôs attack. If set up correctly, this
    won‚Äôt affect legitimate users. However, this only works against a simple attack.
    If Bob architects his attack to send requests from a variety of IP addresses ‚Äî
    a *distributed* attack ‚Äî then this wouldn‚Äôt work.

    blocking that phone number for a cool-off period. We could do this on the front-end,
    but if Bob is determined, he could figure out the backend endpoint to attack instead.
    Blocking the phone number on the backend is harder: it requires keeping a record
    of phone numbers and their recent login attempts.'
