    a completely new cursor format for use in a modern desktop aimed at replacing
    the old standard of XCursor, I think it's a good idea to make a blogpost about
    how cursors actually work on Linux (and BSD, blah blah) in general to help people
    understand what's going on.

- en: Rasters are annoying. Raster means an image is stored with pixels, for example
    a png, or an mp4\. The problem with rasters is that when you resize them, the
    computer has to take a wild guess at what it should look like. There are various
    algorithms that do it, but the most used are bilinear and nearest neighbor.
  id: totrans-split-15

    more blurry.

    it to the user-requested size and be done with it, right?
  id: totrans-split-17

    results. It will almost always look "odd".
  id: totrans-split-18

  id: totrans-split-57

    cursors, and some apps might render them differently, leading to inconsistencies.

  id: totrans-split-58

    say "hey compositor, render a ~~shape~~", which is miles better, as the compositor
    can now draw the cursor.

    cursors are being used, hyprcursor will also be utilized. However, if client-side,
    the classic style, is used, it's up to the app, and most, at the moment, don't
    support hyprcursors.

    get your pixel-perfect hyprcursors.

    over at gtk. If gtk finally supports the protocol, almost all desktop apps that
    people might wanna use on Linux will be able to utilize hyprcursors via the compositor.
