    The conversations are automatically transformed into clinical notes and summaries
    using artificial intelligence. Companies like Microsoft's Nuance Communications,
    Abridge and Suki have developed solutions with these capabilities, which they
    argue will help reduce doctors' administrative workloads and prioritize meaningful
    connections with patients.

    person in front of me — the most important person, the patient — because when
    I hit start, have a conversation, then hit stop, I can swivel my chair and within
    seconds, the note''s there."'
