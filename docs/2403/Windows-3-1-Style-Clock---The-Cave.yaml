- en: I still live in a Windows 3.1 world :) and I love the clock. It's clever, creative,
    and thoughtfully executed. The quality of the printing is great -- this is worthy
    of mounting on my wall. My main objection is that the movement of the clock itself
    is very noisy. I don't think it's poor quality of itself, but I think the metal
    plate of the clock face acts reverberates such that it amplifies the noise. The
    hands themselves are on-brand, but it's seriously distracting in my office. I've
    temporarily disconnected the battery, in the hope that I can find a replacement
    movement which is quieter. 5* for the clock itself, 2* for the sound, 5* for the
    shipping and customer experience.
