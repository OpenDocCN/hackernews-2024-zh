    geometry. We call it “Node Geometry.” An advanced system that allows you to create
    procedural geometry using a non-destructive node tree system.

    and the [Node Material Editor (NME)](https://nme.babylonjs.com/), then you’ll
    feel right at home in the [Node Geometry Editor](https://nge.babylonjs.com/).
    This simple to use tool lets you assemble a non-destructive geometry tree, allowing
    you to create anything from tiny geometric variations, to entire procedural worlds/landscapes.

- en: Procedural geometry offers the ability to create complex geometry at run/build
    time. This means that the end-user doesn’t have to download large 3D assets. Instead,
    the local machines/devices can use the CPU to create those assets. This means
    rather than requiring your web visitors to download hundreds of MBs worth of 3D
    assets, they can instead download a few KBs worth of Node Geometry data and allow
    their own machine to create the geometry. This adds a tremendous layer of flexibility
    for creators to offer the perfect loading/performance optimization for their unique
    web experience!
