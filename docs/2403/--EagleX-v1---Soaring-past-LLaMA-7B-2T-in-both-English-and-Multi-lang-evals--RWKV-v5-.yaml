    model beats out even Mistral 2T++ trained model (sciq, glue, anli, mmnli, swag),
    across multiple tasks focused around either contextual based simple Q&A with common
    sense reasoning, or deductive logic. EagleX also performs better than LLaMA-2-7b
    in wingrade and wnli evals, which also involves contextual common sense reasoning
    as well. This implies that the EagleX model would be applicable in RAG use cases,
    which are mainly contextual Q&A, with the right prompt engineering.
