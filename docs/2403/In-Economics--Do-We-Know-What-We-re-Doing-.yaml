    are large bodies of often-nonobvious theoretical understandings and of careful
    and sometimes-compelling empirical evidence. The profession knows and understands
    many things. Yet today we are in some disarray. We did not collectively predict
    the financial crisis and, worse still, we may have contributed to it through an
    overenthusiastic belief in the efficacy of markets, especially financial markets
    whose structure and implications we understood less well than we thought. Recent
    macroeconomic events, admittedly unusual, have seen quarreling experts whose main
    point of agreement is the incorrectness of others. Economics Nobel Prize winners
    have been known to denounce each other’s work at the ceremonies in Stockholm,
    much to the consternation of those laureates in the sciences who believe that
    prizes are given for getting things right.

- en: Like many others, I have recently found myself changing my mind, a discomfiting
    process for someone who has been a practicing economist for more than half a century.
    I will come to some of the substantive topics, but I start with some general failings.
    I do not include the corruption allegations that have become common in some debates.
    Even so, economists, who have prospered mightily over the past half century, might
    fairly be accused of having a vested interest in capitalism as it currently operates.
    I should also say that I am writing about a (perhaps nebulous) mainstream, and
    that there are many nonmainstream economists.

    technical change can distract us from the importance of power in setting prices
    and wages, in choosing the direction of technical change, and in influencing politics
    to change the rules of the game. Without an analysis of power, it is hard to understand
    inequality or much else in modern capitalism.'

- en: '**Philosophy and ethics:** In contrast to economists from Adam Smith and Karl
    Marx through John Maynard Keynes, Friedrich Hayek, and even Milton Friedman, we
    have largely stopped thinking about ethics and about what constitutes human well-being.
    We are technocrats who focus on efficiency. We get little training about the ends
    of economics, on the meaning of well-being — welfare economics has long since
    vanished from the curriculum — or on what philosophers say about equality. When
    pressed, we usually fall back on an income-based utilitarianism. We often equate
    well-being with money or consumption, missing much of what matters to people.
    In current economic thinking, individuals matter much more than relationships
    between people in families or in communities.'

    to Lionel Robbins’s definition of economics as the allocation of scarce resources
    among competing ends or to the stronger version that says that economists should
    focus on efficiency and leave equity to others, to politicians or administrators.
    But the others regularly fail to materialize, so that when efficiency comes with
    upward redistribution — frequently though not inevitably — our recommendations
    become little more than a license for plunder. Keynes wrote that the problem of
    economics is to reconcile economic efficiency, social justice, and individual
    liberty. We are good at the first, and the libertarian streak in economics constantly
    pushes the last, but social justice can be an afterthought. After economists on
    the left bought into The Chicago School’s deference to markets — “we are all Friedmanites
    now” — social justice became subservient to markets, and a concern with distribution
    was overruled by attention to the average, often nonsensically described as the
    “national interest.”'

- en: '**Empirical methods:** The credibility revolution in econometrics was an understandable
    reaction to the identification of causal mechanisms by assertion, often controversial
    and sometimes incredible. But the currently approved methods, randomized controlled
    trials, differences in differences, or regression discontinuity designs, have
    the effect of focusing attention on local effects, and away from potentially important
    but slow-acting mechanisms that operate with long and variable lags. Historians,
    who understand about contingency and about multiple and multidirectional causality,
    often do a better job than economists of identifying important mechanisms that
    are plausible, interesting, and worth thinking about, even if they do not meet
    the inferential standards of contemporary applied economics.'

    tools that can provide clear-cut answers, but that require assumptions that are
    not valid under all circumstances. It would be good to recognize that there are

    long regarded unions as a nuisance that interfered with economic (and often personal)
    efficiency and welcomed their slow demise. But today large corporations have too
    much power over working conditions, wages, and decisions in Washington, where
    unions currently have little say compared with corporate lobbyists. Unions once
    raised wages for members and nonmembers, they were an important part of social
    capital in many places, and they brought political power to working people in
    the workplace and in local, state, and federal governments. Their decline is contributing
    to the falling wage share, to the widening gap between executives and workers,
    to community destruction, and to rising populism. Daron Acemoglu and Simon Johnson
    have recently argued that the direction of technical change has always depended
    on who has the power to decide; unions need to be at the table for decisions about
    artificial intelligence. Economists’ enthusiasm for technical change as the instrument
    of universal enrichment is no longer tenable (if it ever was).

- en: I am much more skeptical of the benefits of free trade to American workers and
    am even skeptical of the claim, which I and others have made in the past, that
    globalization was responsible for the vast reduction in global poverty over the
    past 30 years. I also no longer defend the idea that the harm done to working
    Americans by globalization was a reasonable price to pay for global poverty reduction
    because workers in America are so much better off than the global poor. I believe
    that the reduction in poverty in India had little to do with world trade. And
    poverty reduction in China could have happened with less damage to workers in
    rich countries if Chinese policies caused it to save less of its national income,
    allowing more of its manufacturing growth to be absorbed at home. I had also seriously
    underthought my ethical judgments about trade-offs between domestic and foreign
    workers. We certainly have a duty to aid those in distress, but we have additional
    obligations to our fellow citizens that we do not have to others.

- en: I used to subscribe to the near consensus among economists that immigration
    to the United States was a good thing, with great benefits to the migrants and
    little or no cost to domestic low-skilled workers. I no longer think so. Economists’
    beliefs are not unanimous on this but are shaped by econometric designs that may
    be credible but often rest on short-term outcomes. Longer-term analysis over the
    past century and a half tells a different story. Inequality was high when America
    was open, was much lower when the borders were closed, and rose again post Hart-Celler
    (the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965) as the fraction of foreign-born
    people rose back to its levels in the Gilded Age. It has also been plausibly argued
    that the Great Migration of millions of African Americans from the rural South
    to the factories in the North would not have happened if factory owners had been
    able to hire the European migrants they preferred.
