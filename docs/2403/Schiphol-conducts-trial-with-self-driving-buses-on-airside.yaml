- en: In 2050, Royal Schiphol Group wants to operate the world's most sustainable
    and high-quality airports. The creation of a more sustainable and emission-free
    ground operation contributes to this ambition. Royal Schiphol Group envisions
    that by 2050 all vehicles will have been replaced by a contiguous fleet of autonomous,
    zero-emission vehicles and all associated processes automated. Even in an autonomous
    ground operation, the employee will still have an important role to play. The
    work will be more directive in nature and will involve a variety of tasks.

- en: Ohmio develops autonomous vehicles connected to an intelligent transport system.
    The buses are self-driving, and they can communicate with traffic signs and other
    (autonomous) vehicles. The technology behind these self-driving vehicles was developed
    by HMI Technologies in Pakuranga, Auckland – a global tech company and innovator
    of intelligent transport systems, such as electronic traffic signs.
