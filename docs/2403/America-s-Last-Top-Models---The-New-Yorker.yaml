- en: The U.S. system was also unique in that no other country required a model to
    accompany a patent application. The reasons why soon became clear. As early as
    the eighteen-thirties, the collection had outgrown the Patent Office’s cramped
    headquarters at the former Blodgett’s Hotel. In 1836, a fire destroyed at least
    seven thousand models, but, rather than abandon the requirement, the Patent Office
    doubled down, securing congressional funding to reconstruct the models and laying
    the foundations for a truly monumental building, with a façade modelled after
    the Parthenon. The structure, which now houses the Smithsonian’s American Art
    Museum and the National Portrait Gallery, occupies an entire city block. In the
    engineer Pierre L’Enfant’s master plan for the capital, it was intended to serve
    as a kind of nondenominational “church of the republic,” between the White House
    on one side and the Capitol on the other.

    fulfilled this vision. The model gallery was regarded as a fitting testament to
    American democracy, demonstrating “the ingenuity of a free people,” as the Pittsfield
    *Sun* put it. But the Civil War marked the beginning of the end. At first, the
    models merely acquired new neighbors: the building became a hospital. “It was,
    indeed, a curious scene,” [Walt Whitman](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/walt-whitman)
    wrote, describing the “high and ponderous glass cases, crowded with models in
    miniature of every kind,” interspersed with “rows of sick, badly wounded and dying
    soldiers.” As the war left a trail of new technologies in its wake, the volume
    of patent applications skyrocketed, and the long galleries were augmented with
    balconies to provide yet more display space. Samuel Sparks Fisher, who became
    the Commissioner of Patents in 1869, pointed out that “it must soon become a serious
    question to determine what disposition is to be made of the models.” The next
    year, Congress passed new legislation, dropping the requirement for models; a
    few years after that, the general public was banned from the building, owing to
    space constraints. The doors of the Temple of Invention began to swing shut, seemingly
    for good.'

- en: The remaining challenge was what to do with the thousands of existing models.
    They were jammed into corridors and hallways, “haphazardly placed on filing cabinets,
    desks, book shelves, under chairs, any available space,” according to Bill Ray,
    a former *Life* staff photographer who published a guide to the models in the
    nineteen-seventies. Another fire, in 1877, did away with about a third of the
    collection. Later, the Smithsonian agreed to accession the thousand it deemed
    most important—“chosen by someone who only knew or cared about sewing machines,”
    Ray complained. The rest were boxed up and stored in a series of rented buildings,
    basements, and even an old livery stable. Finally, in 1925, Congress realized
    that it had spent at least two hundred thousand dollars moving and storing patent
    models during the prior forty years, and appropriated another ten thousand to
    get rid of them once and for all.

  zh: 剩下的挑战是如何处理成千上万个现有模型。据《生活》（*Life*）前摄影师、发布一本指南介绍这些模型的比尔·雷（Bill Ray）所述，它们被“随意地堆放在走廊、门厅，放在文件柜、书桌、书架、椅子底下，任何空余的地方”。另一场火灾发生在1877年，摧毁了大约三分之一的收藏品。后来，史密森尼学会同意接纳他们认为最重要的一千件模型，“由一个只知道或关心缝纫机的人选出”，雷抱怨道。其余的被装箱存放在一系列租用的建筑物、地下室，甚至是一个旧马厩中。最后，在1925年，国会意识到，在过去四十年里，至少花费了二十万美元搬运和存储专利模型，又拨款一万美元彻底处理掉它们。
- en: A few thousand were returned to the inventors or their heirs, and the Smithsonian
    eventually claimed a similar number, but the rest were bought, in bulk, by the
    wealthy pharmaceutical entrepreneur Sir Henry Wellcome, who planned to establish
    a dedicated patent museum. The Depression deferred that dream, and when Wellcome
    died the models were sold to Crosby Gaige, a Broadway producer. As Alain Pottage
    and Brad Sherman recount in “[Figures of Invention](https://www.amazon.com/Figures-Invention-History-Modern-Patent/dp/0199595631),”
    their history of modern patent law, Gaige “staged the opening of selected boxes
    as a kind of performance for which the public was charged an admission fee”—a
    form of entertainment that somehow met with “considerable initial success.” Nonetheless,
    the public appetite for model-unboxing was quickly sated, and, by 1942, the surviving
    models were scattered to collectors far and wide.

  zh: 几千件模型被退还给发明家或他们的继承人，史密森尼学会最终索赔了类似数量，但其余的则被富有的制药企业家亨利·韦尔科姆爵士大规模购买，计划建立一个专门的专利博物馆。大萧条推迟了这个梦想，当韦尔科姆去世时，这些模型被卖给了百老汇制片人克罗斯比·盖奇。正如阿兰·波塔吉（Alain
    Pottage）和布拉德·谢尔曼（Brad Sherman）在他们的《发明人物》（*Figures of Invention*）一书中所述，这是现代专利法的历史，盖奇“把选定的箱子开放作为一种公众需付费观看的表演形式”，这种娱乐方式在一开始获得了“相当大的成功”。尽管如此，公众对于模型开箱的兴趣很快被饱和，到1942年，幸存的模型已经散落到各地的收藏家手中。
- en: Cascio told me that Hagley began collecting patent models in the early nineteen-sixties;
    the museum now has the largest private collection in existence. A little more
    than a hundred are currently on display; thousands more, in varying states of
    conservation, are shelved in a storage room near the estate’s Christmas decorations.
    Much of the collection remains uncatalogued. Cascio, a fifty-year-old historian,
    joined the museum just a few years ago, and told me that, with two thousand models
    left to process, he expects to retire before the job is done. Every so often,
    when he opens a box, he finds an item that has lost its label and any other identifying
    marks. These mystery models—Cascio has come across more than two hundred already—are
    kept in a separate storeroom near his office, where he occasionally goes to wonder,
    What the heck does that thing do?

  zh: 卡西奥告诉我，哈格利（Hagley）从1960年代初开始收集专利模型；现在它拥有现存最大的私人收藏。目前展示的仅有一百多件；还有成千上万件模型，保存状况不同，存放在与庄园圣诞装饰品附近的储藏室中。收藏中的大部分尚未编目。卡西奥，一位五十岁的历史学家，几年前加入博物馆，并告诉我，在还有两千件模型需要处理时，他预计在工作完成之前会退休。不时地，当他打开一个箱子时，他会发现一个失去标签和任何其他标识符的物品。这些神秘的模型——卡西奥已经遇到了两百多件——被保存在他办公室附近的一个单独储藏室中，他偶尔去那里思考，那东西到底是做什么的？
