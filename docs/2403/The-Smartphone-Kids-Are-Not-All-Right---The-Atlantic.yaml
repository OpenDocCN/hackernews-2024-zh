    generation of guinea pigs. “It’s as though we sent Gen Z to grow up on Mars when
    we gave them smartphones in the early 2010s in the largest uncontrolled experiment
    humanity has ever performed on its own children,” Jonathan Haidt writes in *The
    Anxious Generation: How the Great Rewiring of Childhood Is Causing an Epidemic
    of Mental Illness*.'

    loneliness, and suicide](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2024/03/teen-childhood-smartphone-use-mental-health-effects/677722/)
    among young people is directly tied to the wide distribution of smartphones. He
    points to surveys that have been asking teenagers for decades questions about
    mental health, such as: “Life often seems meaningless” or “A lot of times I feel
    lonely.” Survey results remained pretty consistent, and some numbers were even
    improving, before they took a sharp, negative turn somewhere between 2010 and
    2015.'

    advocates that parents don’t give middle schoolers smartphones so they can reclaim
    the old way of socializing, that social-media platforms raise the minimum age
    for use to 16, and that schools ban cellphones during the day, among other straightforward
    solutions. The picture, however, looks a lot less clear when you talk with an
    actual young person. In this episode, I spoke with my child Jacob, and we juxtapose
    theory with lived experience. You’ll hear a mother (me) wrestle in real time with
    the consequences of parenting decisions as Haidt makes the case that we should
    collectively agree to rescue our kids from this experiment.

    We had no wisdom to go by. We just watched as they dove in deeper and deeper and
    had no idea if this was excellent and fresh and creative, or totally ruinous.

    to the ’90s or sometimes the ’70s, and then you plot a bunch of lines, then what
    you see is the numbers—the lines—bounce around. A number of them, they really

    Gen X had the highest suicide rates in history. For whatever reason, the Millennials
    are actually doing better than Gen X, and that’s very clear when you look at the
    ’90s and the 2000s. So you get flat lines, or you get lines sloping down. And

    Jonathan Haidt, this is around the time that teen mental health starts tanking.
    Haidt believes that the uptick in depression, anxiety, and self-harm in young

    She downloaded Instagram, posted on Tumblr, and started checking obsessively for
