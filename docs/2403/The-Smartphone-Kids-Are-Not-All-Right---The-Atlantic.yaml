    generation of guinea pigs. “It’s as though we sent Gen Z to grow up on Mars when
    we gave them smartphones in the early 2010s in the largest uncontrolled experiment
    humanity has ever performed on its own children,” Jonathan Haidt writes in *The
    Anxious Generation: How the Great Rewiring of Childhood Is Causing an Epidemic
    of Mental Illness*.'

    loneliness, and suicide](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2024/03/teen-childhood-smartphone-use-mental-health-effects/677722/)
    among young people is directly tied to the wide distribution of smartphones. He
    points to surveys that have been asking teenagers for decades questions about
    mental health, such as: “Life often seems meaningless” or “A lot of times I feel
    lonely.” Survey results remained pretty consistent, and some numbers were even
    improving, before they took a sharp, negative turn somewhere between 2010 and
    2015.'

- en: The solution, Haidt says, is “easy.” In this episode of *Radio Atlantic*, he
    advocates that parents don’t give middle schoolers smartphones so they can reclaim
    the old way of socializing, that social-media platforms raise the minimum age
    for use to 16, and that schools ban cellphones during the day, among other straightforward
    solutions. The picture, however, looks a lot less clear when you talk with an
    actual young person. In this episode, I spoke with my child Jacob, and we juxtapose
    theory with lived experience. You’ll hear a mother (me) wrestle in real time with
    the consequences of parenting decisions as Haidt makes the case that we should
    collectively agree to rescue our kids from this experiment.

    We had no wisdom to go by. We just watched as they dove in deeper and deeper and
    had no idea if this was excellent and fresh and creative, or totally ruinous.

    I would like to dismiss all this stuff about teens and smartphones as alarmist.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Hanna Rosin:** One of the big things that Haidt looked at was data from a
    national survey called, Monitoring the Future. It’s a wide-ranging survey that
    dates back to the ’70s, and it asks eighth, 10th, and 12th graders a bunch of
    questions—everything from what they think of the government to their attitudes
    toward drug and alcohol use.'

    my life has no purpose*.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Hanna Rosin:** Or *I’m feeling lonely and socially isolated at school*. I
    mean, they’re in a language that is relatable. That’s why I wanted to talk about
    them. It’s sentences that a teenager could relate to.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Haidt:** That’s right. So if you plot with the year on the x-axis going back
    to the ’90s or sometimes the ’70s, and then you plot a bunch of lines, then what
    you see is the numbers—the lines—bounce around. A number of them, they really
    do go down a bit. Down is good. Down is like, *I don’t agree with that. I don’t
    feel depressed*.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Hanna Rosin:** Fewer people say that, or fewer people agree with those depressing
    statements.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Haidt:** That’s right. And this is also a period when suicide rates are dropping.
    Gen X had the highest suicide rates in history. For whatever reason, the Millennials
    are actually doing better than Gen X, and that’s very clear when you look at the
    ’90s and the 2000s. So you get flat lines, or you get lines sloping down. And
    if you cut off your data collection after 2010, no hint of a problem.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now, in 2010, teens are just beginning to get iPhones. But what’s remarkable
    to me is that the mental-health data doesn’t get worse slowly. The mental-health
    data is fine in the 2000s. And then all of a sudden—right around 2012–2013—everything
    falls off a cliff.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Hanna Rosin:** I just want to track the timeline, because these are such
    short periods that people are thinking in their head, *Okay, what happened then?
    What happened then?* So 2012 is the wide acceptance of cell phones? Because it’s
    not when smartphones came around.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Haidt:** The iPhone comes out in 2007, but it’s just amazing in that it’s
    a digital Swiss Army knife, and there were no apps other than the ones that came
    with it. And then the next year we get the app store, and then we get notifications.'

    is not a digital Swiss Army knife that you pull out when *you* need something.
    It is now a portal that millions—millions—of companies now can use to get to you,
    as a child. Without your parents’ permission or knowledge, they can get to you.
    They can send you notifications. They can try to get you to stop your homework

    a small stage—not a stage. Let’s say in a small group where mistakes are not very
    costly. So you say something stupid, and then your friend is mad at you, and then
    maybe she gives you the cold shoulder. Maybe she even starts a rumor about you.
    So that’s the way it always was. That’s very painful, but it’s still relatively
    low stakes.'

    rare. But what we can say is that it’s up for all groups of teenagers. It’s way,
    way up for preteen girls. They have very low rates to begin with, but their rates
    have tripled since before 2010\. So it’s way up. And even if it’s anecdotal—that
    is, even if because so few kids killed themselves. But you know, we saw all those

    She downloaded Instagram, posted on Tumblr, and started checking obsessively for
    comments and likes.'

    in the 2010s, and it didn’t. It goes up like a hockey stick.'

    is great, and so they needed to communicate, and he was already at that time,
