    MIPS processors from several manufacturers in order to replace that closed, opaque,
    insecure, often abandoned and unsupported firmware pre-installed by a vendor.

- en: OpenIPC Firmware comes as binary pre-compiled files for easy installation by
    end-user. Also, we provide full access to the source files for further development
    and improvement by any capable programmer willing to contribute to the project.
    OpenIPC source code is released under one of the most simple open source license
    agreements, [MIT License](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT), giving users express
    permission to reuse code for any purpose, even as part of a proprietary software.
    We only ask you politely to contribute your improvements back to us. We would
    be grateful for any feedback and suggestions.

    distro, and utilizes either [Majestic](https://github.com/OpenIPC/majestic), [Mini](https://github.com/OpenIPC/mini)
    or [Venc](https://github.com/OpenIPC/silicon_research) streamer.

- en: Majestic code while is not open, provides unprecedented performance and capabilities
    for a wide range of hardware. The author of Majestic streamer is looking into
    possibilities to open-source the codebase after he secures enough funds to support
    further open development. You can [help](/support-open-source) to make it happen
    sooner.

- en: First of all, OpenIPC Firmware brings you freedom. With OpenIPC on your camera
    you are the master of your streams. You have full access to the system and can
    control what, where, and how you want your camera to behave. There are no backdoors,
    no botnets, no crypto-mining malware, no keyloggers, no password sniffers, nothing
    you could possibly expect in a closed binary system with no access to its source
    code.

- en: As for the Firmware capabilities, we strive to provide universal support for
    a wide range of cameras, thus we are focused on basic functionality first, allowing
    end-users to upgrade their cameras' firmware and stream video and audio (where
    supported) without too much hassle.

    storage, streaming video to Youtube and Telegram, using SOCKS5 proxy, setting
    up a Virtual Tunnel, and more.

    camera to be mounted on a drone, for mounting on construction helmets, for use
    in surveying tools, for medical research of the organs of vision, underwater fishing,
    etc.
