- en: The Sapporo High Court on Thursday ruled that a ban on same-sex marriage is
    unconstitutional, with strong phrasing that is expected to pressure the government
    and lawmakers for action.

- en: The high court judgment followed a similar ruling at the Tokyo District Court
    earlier on Thursday, which said that the ban on same-sex marriage is in a “state
    of unconstitutionality” due to the lack of legal protections for same-sex couples.
    The Tokyo court, however, stopped short of issuing a stronger “unconstitutional”
    verdict.
