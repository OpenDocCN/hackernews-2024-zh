    area of IP ownership was complex. By 2003, the rights in Unix had been transferred
    several times and there was dispute as to the correct owner in law. Also, some
    of the code within Unix had been written prior to the [Copyright Act of 1976](/wiki/Copyright_Act_of_1976

    International](/wiki/Caldera_International "Caldera International"), asserted
    in 2003 that it was the owner of Unix, and that other Unix-type operating systems—particularly
    the [free](/wiki/Free_software "Free software") operating system [Linux](/wiki/Linux

    fear](/wiki/Fear,_uncertainty_and_doubt "Fear, uncertainty and doubt") into the
    market about using them. However, it was unable to formulate such a case, since
    the Unix copyrights were weakly worded, there was no basis in patent law, and
    breach of trade secrets would only affect the one or few companies who might have
    been alleged to have disclosed trade secrets. Lacking grounds to sue all users

    were then sold to the [Santa Cruz Operation](/wiki/Santa_Cruz_Operation "Santa

    of creative works whose copyright is owned by another party is illegal without
    permission from the copyright owner, usually in the form of a license; the GPL
    is such a license, and thus allows distribution, but only under limited conditions.
    Since IBM released the relevant code under the terms of the GPL, it claims that
    the only permission that SCO has to copy and distribute IBM's code in Linux is
    under the terms and conditions of the GPL, one of which requires the distributor
    to "accept" the GPL. IBM says that SCO violated the GPL by denouncing the GPL's
    validity, and by claiming that the GPL violates the U.S. Constitution, together
    with copyright, antitrust and export control laws. IBM also claims that SCO's
    SCOsource program is incompatible with the requirement that redistributions of
    GPLed works must be free of copyright licensing fees (fees may be charged for
    the acts of duplication and support). IBM has brought counterclaims alleging that
    SCO has violated the GPL and breached IBM's copyrights by collecting licensing

    SCO Group started their SCOsource initiative, which sells licenses of SCO's claimed
    copyrighted software, other than OpenServer and Unixware licenses. After a small
    number of high-profile sales (including one that was denied by the claimed purchaser),
    SCO claimed to offer corporate users of Linux a license at US$699 per processor
    running Linux. However, many individuals^([*[who?](/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style/Words_to_watch#Unsupported_attributions
    "Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Words to watch")*]) have found it impossible to buy
    such a license from SCO. SCO says that participants of the SCOsource initiative
    are not liable for any claims that SCO makes against Linux users.
