    poultry industry for centuries.

- en: For a poultry farmer, the male chicken is useless. They don‚Äôt lay eggs, their
    meat is stringy and farmers ideally want to get rid of them as soon as they are
    born. The problem is, it‚Äôs impossible to determine the sex of a chick when it‚Äôs
    born. It takes 4‚Äì6 weeks, and by this time, the farmer has wasted enough food
    and resources to grow them.

    chick could be used to determine the sex of a chick. This discovery was announced
    in 1927, and instantly revolutionized the global hatchery industry.

    best graduates were from the Zen-Nippon Chick Sexing School; whose standards were
    so rigorous, only 5 to 10 percent of students received accreditation. (yes, there
    is a school!) But if you graduated from this school, you could earn as much as
    $500 a day and were flown across the world to‚Ä¶ ascertain the sex of chicks.

    folks, ascertaining the sex of a day-old chick was hard. The chick‚Äôs rear end
    had a constellation of folds, marks, spots, and bumps that revealed the sex of
    a chick. But, these were extremely hard to read.

    that a sexer has to learn to become competent at their job. And given that they
    have to make these decisions in seconds, it became even harder to understand how
    they do what they do.

    how Chicken sexers did their jobs. Reams of dissertations and papers have been
    written about what they do, and how they do their jobs.

    did their job. It was just‚Ä¶ an inexplicable art üòÆ. Within 3 seconds, **they just
    ‚Äúknow‚Äù** the sex of a chick. They saw things that a common person simply does
    not see. Turns out, tt‚Äôs a unique art, as much as skill.

    why we need to take outlandish bets that don‚Äôt immediately translate into money.
    It‚Äôs hard to explain why a random game, a campaign, or an activity translates
    into brand quotient. These are matters of taste, and just‚Ä¶ knowing.

    for long enough, **you just know** what it takes to differentiate a brand. This
    taste is tangible for a brand marketer. And equally inexplicable, I must add.

    a kind of Jakob‚Äôs Law to bring parity by determining what ‚Äòothers are doing‚Äô.
    The more you gauge competition, the deeper the trap. Radical work is doing uncomfortable
    things ‚Äî that‚Äôs the very essence of brand marketing.

    Chicken sexers. A marketer‚Äôs job is enunciating differentiation. If AI is a learning
    model trained on what exists, it‚Äôs at best the top 10% of what‚Äôs out there. *That
    is the arbitrage for a marketer*. If you want to foolproof your job, you have
    to beat the top 10% of an AI model. Good odds, if you ask me üòú
