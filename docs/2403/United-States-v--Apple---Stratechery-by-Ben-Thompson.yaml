    focus on the user experience not only defends against disruption, but it also
    provides an offensive advantage as well: namely, Apple increases its user experience
    advantage through the leverage it gains from consumers loyal to the company. In
    the case of iTunes, Apple was able to create the most seamless music acquisition
    process possible: the labels had no choice but to go along. Similarly, when it
    comes to smartphones, Apple devices from day one have not been cluttered with
    carrier branding or apps or control over updates. If carriers didn’t like Apple’s
    insistence on creating the best possible user experience, well, consumers who
    valued said experience were more than happy to take their business elsewhere.
    In effect, Apple builds incredible user experiences, which gains them loyal customers
    who collectively have massive market power, which Apple can then effectively wield
    to get its way — a way that involves maximizing the user experience. It’s a virtuous

    control of critical APIs, to degrade the functionality of third-party cross-platform
    smartwatches in at least three significant ways: First, Apple deprives iPhone
    users with third-party smartwatches of the ability to respond to notifications.
    Second, Apple inhibits third-party smartwatches from maintaining a reliable connection
    with the iPhone. And third, Apple undermines the performance of third-party smartwatches
    that connect directly with a cellular network. In doing so, Apple constrains user
    choice and crushes innovation that might help fill in the moat around Apple’s
    smartphone monopoly.'

    is a direct attack on Apple’s core differentiation: the deep integration of software,
    hardware, and services across its devices. The Apple Watch has access to private
    APIs and system-level integrations that Apple claims provide for better battery
    life, messaging management, etc.; the DOJ says that these integrations should
    be modularized and made available to all smart watches. There is no consideration
    as to whether or not Apple’s claims are true, or acknowledgment that Apple’s integration
    was supposedly a losing proposition a decade ago: now that the company has been
    proven successful, said proposition is alleged to be monopoly maintenance.'

    will eventually become “something people do every day of their lives.” But Apple
    has used its control over app creation, including its technical and contractual
    control over API access, to effectively block third-party developers from creating
    digital wallets on the iPhone with tap-to-pay functionality, which is an important
    feature of a digital wallet for smartphones. As a result, Apple maintains complete
    control over how users make tap-to-pay payments with their iPhone. Apple also
    deprives users of the benefits and innovations third-party wallets would provide
    so that it can protect “Apple’s most important and successful business, iPhone.”

    to be made that Apple has reserved NFC tap-to-pay access for itself in order to
    leverage its iPhone control into control of an adjacent market (digital wallets),
    but I have a hard time buying the DOJ’s argument that this imposes unacceptable
    switching costs to another smartphone. It’s also, in my estimation, fairly weak
    gruel for an antitrust case of this magnitude, particularly given that an integrated
    wallet is, once again, very much in line with Apple’s longstanding brand promise.

    not simply the loss of developer goodwill, but something even more important to
    Apple: its fundamental differentiation, i.e. integration. I stated the risk explicitly

    nuance I discussed in *App Store Arguments* becomes much more black-and-white.
    Yes, Apple created the iPhone and the App Store and, under current U.S. antitrust
    doctrine, almost certainly has the right to impose whatever taxes it wishes on
    third parties, including 30% on purchases and the first year of subscriptions,
    and completely cutting off developers from their customers. Antitrust law, though,
    while governed by Supreme Court precedent, is not a matter of constitutionality:
    it stems from laws passed by Congress, and it can be changed by new laws passed
    by Congress.'

    are significant limitations on the ability of platforms to offer apps and services,
    or integrate them in any way that advantages their offerings. In this potential
    world it’s not simply problematic that Apple charges Spotify 30%, or else forces
    the music streaming service to hope that users figure out how to subscribe on
    the web, even as Apple Music has a fully integrated sign-up flow and no 30% tax;
    it is also illegal to incorporate Apple Music into SharePlay or Shared-with-you
    or Photos, or in the most extreme versions of these proposed laws, even have Apple
    Music at all. This limitation would apply to basically every WWDC announcement:
    say good-bye to Quick Note or SharePlay-as-an-exclusive-service, or any number
    of Apple’s integrated offerings.'

    really does often lead to better outcomes sooner — and would be a disaster for
    Apple. The entire company’s differentiation is predicated on integration, including
    its ability to abuse its App Store position, and it would be a huge misstep if
    the inability to resist the latter imperiled the former.

    for this lawsuit in the first place.

    they do want to sue Apple, so they framed Apple’s defining characteristic — integration
    — in the most uncharitable light possible to make their case. To put it another
    way, the *Epic* case may have shown that Apple’s policies around the App Store
    were (mostly) legal, but that didn’t mean they were right; now the DOJ, looking
    for another point of vulnerability, is trying to make the case that Apple’s right
    approach in delivering an integrated experience is in fact illegal.

    is that the App Store is a side hustle for Apple. Yes it’s earning Apple $10+
    billion a year, and even for Apple that’s significant. But it’s not Apple’s main
    business by a long shot. To my knowledge no company in history has ever gotten
    into antitrust hot water over a side business so comparatively small to its overall
    business. Apple doesn’t need this.

    that Apple has earned every dollar it generates from third-party software in the
    App Store, and that their policies in place are just and fair. That righteousness
    came out on the stand in the Epic trial. But even if Apple’s executives are correct — if
    the current rules and revenue splits could somehow be proven to be dialed in to
    a hypothetical Platonic ideal of fairness to all parties involved — that doesn’t
    change the fact that so many developers see it otherwise.

    removing the anti-steering provision and not going after small developers with
    online services — it wouldn’t be in a position of having to defend what actually
