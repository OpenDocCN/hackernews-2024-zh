    focus on the user experience not only defends against disruption, but it also
    provides an offensive advantage as well: namely, Apple increases its user experience
    advantage through the leverage it gains from consumers loyal to the company. In
    the case of iTunes, Apple was able to create the most seamless music acquisition
    process possible: the labels had no choice but to go along. Similarly, when it
    comes to smartphones, Apple devices from day one have not been cluttered with
    carrier branding or apps or control over updates. If carriers didn’t like Apple’s
    insistence on creating the best possible user experience, well, consumers who
    valued said experience were more than happy to take their business elsewhere.
    In effect, Apple builds incredible user experiences, which gains them loyal customers
    who collectively have massive market power, which Apple can then effectively wield
    to get its way — a way that involves maximizing the user experience. It’s a virtuous
    circle.'

    it produces a superior product that customers are willing to pay for. However,
    as a product category matures, even modular products become “good enough” — customers
    may know that the integrated product has superior features or specs, but they
    aren’t willing to pay more, and thus the low-priced providers, who build a product
    from parts with prices ground down by competition, come to own the market. Christensen

    Apple decreed that 3rd-party apps could only be installed via the App Store, which

    take 30% of paid apps. This led to an absolute explosion in the market: consumers,
    who had been scarred by the 2000’s era of malware and viruses, shook off their
    reticence to install software and embraced the App Store, leading to an explosion
    of app-based businesses. An important development was the 2009 addition of in-app

    App Store，从而促成了基于应用的企业的蓬勃发展。一个重要的发展是2009年引入的应用内购买，特别是为游戏开启了全新的商业模式。出版物的订阅服务于2011年推出，尽管直到另外五年后，这种商业模式才对所有应用程序开放。

    Apple. The entire company’s differentiation is predicated on integration, including
    its ability to abuse its App Store position, and it would be a huge misstep if
    the inability to resist the latter imperiled the former.

  zh: 我认为，作为用户，这些限制会让人感到失望——整合确实经常能更快地带来更好的结果——对于苹果来说，这将是一场灾难。整个公司的差异化建立在整合的基础上，包括滥用其App
    Store的位置，如果无法抵制后者而危及前者，那将是一个巨大的错误。
- en: Last week this danger manifested, not as new legislation, but as this lawsuit,
    which attacks Apple’s integration much more than it attacks the App Store. I think,
    though, that it was Apple’s policies around the App Store that created the conditions
    for this lawsuit in the first place.

  zh: 上周，这种危险并未表现为新的立法，而是作为这起诉讼案件的形式出现，这起诉讼更多地攻击的是苹果的整合策略，而不是App Store。我认为，正是苹果在App
    Store周围的政策首先创造了这起诉讼的条件。
- en: In short, I suspect the DOJ doesn’t want to follow in Epic’s footsteps, but
    they do want to sue Apple, so they framed Apple’s defining characteristic — integration
    — in the most uncharitable light possible to make their case. To put it another
    way, the *Epic* case may have shown that Apple’s policies around the App Store
    were (mostly) legal, but that didn’t mean they were right; now the DOJ, looking
    for another point of vulnerability, is trying to make the case that Apple’s right
    approach in delivering an integrated experience is in fact illegal.

  zh: 简而言之，我怀疑司法部并不想步 Epic 的后尘，但他们确实想起诉苹果，所以他们以最不友好的方式框定了苹果的定义特征——整合，以支持他们的案件。换句话说，*Epic*
    案件可能已经表明，苹果在App Store周围的政策（大部分）是合法的，但这并不意味着它们是正确的；现在，司法部寻找另一个漏洞点，试图证明苹果在提供整合体验时实际上是违法的。

- en: What’s weirdest about Apple’s antitrust and PR problems related to the App Store
    is that the App Store is a side hustle for Apple. Yes it’s earning Apple $10+
    billion a year, and even for Apple that’s significant. But it’s not Apple’s main
    business by a long shot. To my knowledge no company in history has ever gotten
    into antitrust hot water over a side business so comparatively small to its overall
    business. Apple doesn’t need this.

  zh: 关于苹果与App Store相关的反垄断和公关问题最奇怪的是，App Store对于苹果来说只是一个副业。是的，它每年给苹果赚取超过10亿美元，即使对于苹果来说这也是一笔可观的收入。但它并不是苹果的主要业务。据我所知，历史上没有任何一家公司因为其主要业务的副业陷入反垄断的麻烦。苹果并不需要这些问题。
- en: I think Apple’s senior leadership — Cook in particular — truly does believe
    that Apple has earned every dollar it generates from third-party software in the
    App Store, and that their policies in place are just and fair. That righteousness
    came out on the stand in the Epic trial. But even if Apple’s executives are correct — if
    the current rules and revenue splits could somehow be proven to be dialed in to
    a hypothetical Platonic ideal of fairness to all parties involved — that doesn’t
    change the fact that so many developers see it otherwise.

  zh: 我认为苹果的高级领导层——特别是库克——确实相信苹果从第三方软件在App Store中赚取的每一美元都是应得的，并且他们制定的政策是公正的。这种正义感在Epic官司中表现出来。但即使苹果的高管们是正确的——如果当前的规则和收入分成能被证明是对所有相关方公平的假设的理想状态——这并不改变许多开发者对此看法的事实。
- en: I don’t think the developers are wrong, but even if they are wrong, it’s not
    good for Apple that they’re so unhappy, and feel so aggrieved. It’s not good for
    Apple that developers don’t see the App Store as a platform that works in their
    interests. Like the Apple logo, “developer goodwill” has no price tag.

  zh: 我认为开发者们并没有错，但即使他们错了，对于苹果来说，这种不满和感到委屈也不是好事。开发者们不将App Store视为符合他们利益的平台对苹果来说也不利。就像苹果的Logo一样，“开发者的好感度”是无价的。
- en: 'To the extent I am right — and yes, it is impossible to prove a counterfactual
    — the price tag of Apple’s “side hustle” is even higher than Gruber thought: I
    believe that if Apple had done even the bare minimum with the App Store — i.e.
    removing the anti-steering provision and not going after small developers with
    online services — it wouldn’t be in a position of having to defend what actually
    makes Apple Apple. It would, at a minimum, have a lot more people on its side.'

  zh: 如果我的观点是正确的——是的，不可能证明反事实的真实性——苹果“副业”的代价甚至比Gruber认为的更高：我相信，如果苹果甚至只是最基本地处理App Store——即删除反导引条款并不追究在线服务中的小开发者——它就不会陷入必须捍卫苹果真正核心的立场。至少，它会拥有更多支持者。
