    about the hobby, was building up my toolkit of home brewed accessories that I
    would use to paint. During my time painting, I repurposed a fishing tackle box
    as a mobile painting station, used bamboo spice racks for organizing my paints,
    and had the big brain idea of drilling magnets into my paintbrush handles so I
    could hang them for storage. I even crafted my own washes from diluted inks. My
    personal workflow fixed deficiencies I encountered over the course of years of
    painting.

    seasoned programmer as well. From configuring custom key bindings in Emacs, to
    writing little scripts that automate problems only I have, and agonizing over
    the ideal keyboard for programming, I‚Äôve been meticulously honing my programming
    environment for years.

    have asked me, ‚Äú*What if you are working on a machine that isn‚Äôt set up with your
    workflow?* ‚Äù, as if I would somehow be unable to work in that environment. Sure
    there might be some pain, but it‚Äôs not like I would suddenly have forgotten how
    to program.

- en: This reminds me of an anecdote of my CTO a few years ago. He was using my Macbook
    and trying to copy and paste something out of my terminal. His Mac was set up
    to copy as soon as the mouse was done highlighting, but mine wasn‚Äôt. He kept going
    to paste the output into another program and getting nothing. It took him a few
    tries to realize what was going on, but he got it eventually. So sure, my muscle
    memory might betray me in the beginning, but after a time things will go smoothly
    again. Plus I like to think it‚Äôs good for my brain. You know, neuroplasticity
    and stuff.

    have built, which otherwise spends most of its day unappreciated in the background.
    It‚Äôs also a sentiment that can be applied in other domains as well. James Hoffman,
    a World Barista Champion turned coffee YouTuber, touches on this in his video
    [What No One Tells You About Learning To Taste](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tU1y7hBSgiY)

    that there we downsides that were making him unhappy. He avoided bad coffee and
    was a burden on his friends due to his high expectations around it. But he realized
    that he could still enjoy good coffee. He just needed to change his perspective.

    it out, but when it was gonna happen I just let it happen.

    programming, the inability to always work in your preferred environment, should
    not rob you of the little things that make programming enjoyable. Programming
    is as much an art as science, and a little bit of personal expression is always
    fun. So remember‚Ä¶
