    of the tool, and moving into the full-scale launch of the pilot will give more
    taxpayers the chance to use this free option,” said IRS Commissioner Danny Werfel.
    “Expanding Direct File as the tax deadline approaches will provide more taxpayers
    a way to file directly with the IRS for free, and it will give us more valuable
    information to assess this pilot. For those who haven’t filed their taxes in these
    12 states, we encourage them to visit IRS.gov and see if Direct File is the right
    option for them.”

    meet their tax obligations as easily and quickly as possible. We developed Direct
    File from the beginning with taxpayers’ help, and we’ll continue to talk to taxpayers
    about their experience to learn more about what taxpayers want for future digital

    code to complete their filing easily with an accurate calculation of their refund

    the tax return is complete and accurate. Once taxpayers start their return on
    the [Direct File](https://directfile.irs.gov/ "IRS Direct File") site, they can
    pause and then securely sign in to finish any time before the April filing deadline.

    Reduction Act mandated that the IRS study interest in and feasibility of creating
    a direct e-filing tool taxpayers could use to prepare and file their federal income
    tax return. The IRS commissioned an independent study, which indicated broad interest
    in such a system, which the IRS detailed in a [Direct File Report to Congress](/newsroom/irs-submits-direct-file-report-to-congress-treasury-department-directs-pilot-to-evaluate-key-issues
    "IRS submits Direct File report to Congress; Treasury Department directs pilot

    to start their returns. On March 4, the IRS announced that Direct File would enter
    final testing, which included an allotment of available spaces with more spaces
    added every day. Direct File is now open to all eligible taxpayers in pilot states
    to decide if it is the right option for them to file their 2023 federal tax return
    online for free, directly with IRS.
