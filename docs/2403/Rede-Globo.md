30 years later, technological changes have changed the face of communication. From the format of television sets to the birth of new platforms, now more interactive than ever before, the fonts began to fulfill important new functions in their communication.

Inquiring about their use of fonts, we discovered a scale, ranging from institutional to independent. Novels, for example, were treated as stand-alone products, whose identity is thought separately from other shows. News and other products follow the institutional language of the broadcaster, where it was dominated by *Globoface*. In journalism, the graphic language was undergoing changes, but with little or no update in the typefaces.

Having served Globo faithfully for decades, *Globoface* had not been planned for a world where content can be consumed on platforms as distinct and high resolution as today.

Therefore, our responsibility was to redesign the typographic voice of Rede Globo, evolving and maturing the personality of Globoface for the future plans of the broadcaster.
