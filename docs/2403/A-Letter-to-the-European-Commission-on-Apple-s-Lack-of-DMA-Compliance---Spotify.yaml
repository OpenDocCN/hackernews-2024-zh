- en: We are very concerned that Apple’s proposed scheme for compliance with the Digital
    Markets Act (DMA), as communicated on 25 January 2024, will not meet the law’s
    requirements therefore inhibiting our ability to deliver the benefits of the DMA
    to consumers as soon as possible.

    but if left unchanged, make a mockery of the DMA and the considerable efforts
    by the European Commission and EU institutions to make digital markets competitive.

- en: Apple is offering app developers an unworkable choice between staying on its
    current terms – which are manifestly not compliant with the DMA – or opting into
    new terms, implying that only app developers opting into the new terms will benefit
    from the DMA. This is a false choice and merely adds unnecessary complexity and
    confusion. Neither option is DMA compliant and both options would simply consolidate
    Apple’s stronghold over digital markets.

- en: The new fee structure in the proposed new terms seems designed to maintain and
    even amplify Apple’s exploitation of its dominance over app developers. With a
    hefty transaction fee and a Core Technology Fee (CTF), few app developers will
    agree to these unjust terms. These fees will deter app developers from providing
    seamless in-app experiences for consumers, and will hamper fair competition with
    potential alternative payment providers.

    protections to reduce privacy and security risks the DMA creates.” This is masquerading
    unfounded privacy and security concerns to the detriment of user choice. Apple’s
    approach – such as the introduction of “scare screens” – will merely mislead and
    degrade the user experience, depriving them of real choice and the benefits of
    the DMA.

- en: To succeed, the DMA must create opportunities for real competition, including
    alternative app stores and sideloading. New app stores are critical to driving
    competition and choice both for app developers and consumers. Sideloading will
    give app developers a real choice between the Apple App Store or their own distribution
    channel and technology. Apple’s new terms do not allow for sideloading and make
    the installation and use of new app stores difficult, risky and financially unattractive
    for developers. Rather than creating healthy competition and new choices, Apple’s
    new terms will erect new barriers and reinforce Apple’s stronghold over the iPhone
    ecosystem.
