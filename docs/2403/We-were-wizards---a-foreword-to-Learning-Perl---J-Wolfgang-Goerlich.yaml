    below, Larry Wall’s foreword to *Learning Perl* from 1993\. It greatly inspired
    a very young me who wandered into a book shop, picked up an odd book with llama
    on the cover and a seemingly misspelled title. The first few pages had me hooked
    and led me on a romp that would last decades. I hope it’ll inspire you, too. As
    Larry put it, “So be it! So do it!” — Wolf

    if too short. Allow me to be the first to welcome you to the College of Wizardry
    and, more particularly, to this introductory class in the Magic of Perl. I am
    not your regular instructor, but Professor Schwartz was unavoidably delayed, and
    has asked me, as the creator of Perl, to step in today and give a few introductory
    remarks.

  zh: 问候，志向成为魔术师的各位。希望你们的暑假愉快，尽管可能有些短。我很荣幸地欢迎你们来到魔法学院，尤其是参加这门《Perl魔法入门》课程。我不是你们的常规教师，但是由于Schwartz教授临时有事，作为Perl的创造者，他要求我今天代替他发表一些开场白。

    I could talk about. I could take the egotistical approach and talk about myself,
    elucidating all those quirks of genetics and upbringing that brought me to the
    place of creating Perl, as well as making a fool of myself in general. That might
    be entertaining, at least to me.

    this course of instruction wouldn’t exist.

- en: When the curriculum committee discussed as this course, it reached the conclusion
    that this class isn’t so much about Perl as it is be you! This shouldn’t be too
    surprising, because Perl is itself also about you – at least in the abstract.
    Perl was created for someone like you, by someone like you, with the collaboration
    as many other someones like you. The Magic of Perl was sewn together, stitch by
    stich and swatch by swatch, around the rather peculiar shape of your psyche. If
    you think Perl is a bit odd, perhaps that’s why.

  zh: 当课程委员会讨论这门课程时，他们得出结论，这门课程不仅仅是关于Perl，更重要的是关于你们自己！这并不奇怪，因为Perl本身也是关于你们的 – 至少在抽象的层面上是这样。Perl是为像你们这样的人而创造的，由像你们这样的人创造，并与其他许多像你们这样的人合作而成。Perl的魔力是一点点地用你们心灵的独特形状缝合而成的。如果你觉得Perl有些奇怪，也许正因如此。
- en: Some computer scientists (the reductionists, in particular) would like to deny
    it, but people have funny-shaped minds. Mental geography is not linear, and cannot
    be mapped onto a flat surface without severe distortion. But for the last score
    years or so, computer reductionists have been first bowing down at the Temple

    conceptual ancestors have transcended the dreary landscape to compose many lovely
    computer incantations. (Some of which, at times, actually did what you wanted
    them to.) The most blessed of these incantations were canonized as Standards,

    miracle of Doing What You Expect.

- en: What nobody noticed in all the excitement was that the computer reductionists
    were still busily trying to smush your minds flat, albeit on a slightly higher
    plane of existence. The decree, therefore, went out (I’m sure you’ve heard of
    it) that computer incantations were only allowed to perform one miracle apiece.
    “Do one thing and do it well” was the rallying cry, and with one stroke, shell
    programmers were condemned to a life of muttering and counting beads on strings
    (which in these latter days have come to be known as pipelines).

  zh: 在所有的兴奋中，没有人注意到计算机简化论者们依然忙着试图将你们的思维压扁，尽管在稍高的存在层面上。因此，有一项法令颁布出来（我相信你们听说过），即计算机咒语只被允许执行一次奇迹。"做一件事，并做好它"成为了集结的呼号，于是，一举之间，Shell程序员们被判定为终生低声咕哝和数算串珠（这在后来的日子里被称为管道）。
- en: This was when I made my small contribution to saving the world. I was rolling
    some of those very beads around in my fingers one day and pondering the hopelessness
    (and haplessness) of my existence, when it occurred to me that it might be interesting
    to melt down some of those mystical beads and see what would happen to their Magic
    if I made a single, slightly larger bead out of them. So l fired up the old Bunsen
    burner, picked out some of my favorite beads, and let them melt together however
    they would. And lo! the new Magic was more powerful than the sum of its parts

- en: That’s odd, thought I. Why should it be that the Sedulous Bead of Regular Expressions,
    when bonded together with the Shellacious Bead of Gnostic Interpolation, and the
    Awkward Bead of Simple Data Typology, should produce more Magic, pound for pound,
    than they do when strung out on strings? I said to myself, could it be that the
    beads can exchange power with each other because they no longer have to commune
    with each other through that skinny little string? Could the pipeline be holding
    back the flow of information, much as wine doth resist flowing through the neck
    of Doctor von Neumann’s famous bottle?

    explosion of potential incantations: the Basic Bead of Output Formats and the
    Lispery Bead of Dynamic Scoping bonded themselves with the C-rationalized Bead
    of Operators Galore, and together they put forth a brilliant pulse of power that
    spread to thousands of machines throughout the entire civilized world. That message

    Magic grew yet more powerful, as yet more synergy was imbued in the silly thing.
    It was as if the Computational Elementals summoned by each bead were cooperating
    on your behalf to solve your problems for you. Why the sudden peace on earth and
    good will toward mentality? Perhaps it was because the beads were your favorite
    beads? Perhaps it was because I’m just a good bead picker?

    of strange runes and ancient chants, some easy and some difficult, many of which
    sound familiar, and some of which don’t. You may be tempted to become discouraged
    and quit. But think you upon this: consider how long it took you to learn your
    own native tongue. Was it worth it? I think so. And have you finished learning
    it? I think not. Then do not expect to learn all the mysteries of Perl in a moment,
    as though you were consuming a mere peanut, or an olive. Rather, think of it as
