  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Why didn’t this library work in conjunction with the latest version of AWS?
    Who knows? Not even the developers of the library might know, because the JavaScript
    ecosystem is so badly interconnected that everyone relies on blindly trusting
    each other’s code and infrastructure. It’s not even close to the experience of
    using robust package managers like Cargo (Rust), NuGet (C#), or others.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: JS works, and it works well for a lot of things. But don’t try to build a truly
    scalable system with it. It’s simply too difficult to avoid shooting yourself
    in the foot entirely when the ecosystem is this fragile and delicate. One tiny
    version mismatch or breaking change can bring your mission-critical application
    to a standstill, as we painfully experienced.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The JavaScript world moves too fast, with dependencies changing constantly and
    breaking backwards compatibility. This makes it extremely high-risk for any project
    aiming to be an enterprise-grade, long-lasting solution. The deck is stacked against
    you when you have to wrestle with the ever-changing currents of the npm universe
    and its nitty gritty issues.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It feels like you’re constantly swimming against the current, needing to be
    a domain expert on the most granular details just to keep your application afloat.
    It’s an unnecessarily high cognitive burden that often outweighs the benefits
    JavaScript provides.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Don’t get me wrong, JavaScript has it’s a good tool sometimes. But we’ve learned
    the hard way that it simply isn’t the right tool for building robust platforms
    that need to stand the test of time.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    applications, the costs of dealing with its chaos and nitty gritty issues are
    too high.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: At this point, it’s not even about JavaScript itself, but about the fundamental
    lack of trust a developer can have with its tools. Imagine a carpenter with a
    hammer that drives nails most of the time, but then randomly and unpredictably
    strikes the carpenter instead.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Why would that carpenter want to use such an unreliable and hazardous hammer
    for every piece of furniture they build? It makes no sense. And yet, that’s the
    situation we find ourselves in with JavaScript.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I don’t know if upcoming projects like Bun.js or Deno will do anything to rectify
    the situation. I simply believe the JavaScript language itself has become too
    amorphous and monstrous to not consistently breed confusion across builds and
    deployments.
