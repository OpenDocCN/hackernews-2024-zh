    which carries sounds and images to convey the richness and diversity of life on
    Earth, the layered message on Europa Clipper aims to spark the imagination and
    offer a unifying vision.

    said Lori Glaze, director of the Planetary Science Division at NASA Headquarters
    in Washington. “The plate combines the best humanity has to offer across the universe
    – science, technology, education, art, and math. The message of connection through
    water, essential for all forms of life as we know it, perfectly illustrates Earth’s
    tie to this mysterious ocean world we are setting out to explore.”

- en: In 2030, after a 1.6-billion-mile (2.6-billion-kilometer) journey, Europa Clipper
    will begin orbiting Jupiter, making 49 close flybys of Europa. To determine if
    there are conditions that could support life, the spacecraft’s powerful suite
    of [science instruments](https://europa.nasa.gov/spacecraft/instruments/) will
    gather data about the moon’s subsurface ocean, icy crust, thin atmosphere, and
    space environment. The electronics for those instruments are housed in a [massive
    metal vault](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/how-nasa-is-protecting-europa-clipper-from-space-radiation)
    designed to protect them from Jupiter’s punishing radiation. The commemorative
    plate will seal an opening in the vault.
