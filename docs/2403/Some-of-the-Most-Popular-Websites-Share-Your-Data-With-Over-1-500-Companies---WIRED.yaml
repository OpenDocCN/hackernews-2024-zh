- en: Everywhere you go online, you’re being tracked. Almost every time you visit
    a website, trackers gather data about your browsing and [funnel it back into targeted
    advertising systems](https://www.wired.com/story/how-pentagon-learned-targeted-ads-to-find-targets-and-vladimir-putin/),
    which build up detailed profiles about your interests and make big profits in
    the process. In some places, you’re tracked more than others.

- en: In a little-noticed change at the end of last year, thousands of websites started
    being more transparent about how many companies your data is being shared with.
    In November, those infuriating [cookie pop-ups](https://www.wired.com/story/cookie-popup-blocker-gdpr/)—which
    ask your permission to collect and share data—began sharing how many advertising
    “partners” each website is working with, giving a further glimpse of the sprawling
    advertising ecosystem. For many sites, it’s not pretty.

- en: A WIRED analysis of the top 10,000 most popular websites shows that dozens of
    sites say they are sharing data with more than 1,000 companies, while thousands
    of other websites are sharing data with hundreds of firms. Quiz and puzzle website
    [JetPunk](https://www.jetpunk.com/) tops the pile, listing 1,809 “partners” that
    may collect personal information, including “browsing behavior or unique IDs.”

    People.com, and Allrecipes.com—all say they can share data with 1,609 partners.
    The newspaper *The Daily Mail* lists 1,207 partners, while internet speed-monitoring
    firm Speedtest.net, online medical publisher WebMD, and media outlets Reuters,
    ESPN, and BuzzFeed all state they can share data with 809 companies. (WIRED, for
    context, lists 164 partners.) These hundreds of advertising partners include dozens
    of firms most people have likely never heard of.

    you are,” says [Midas Nouwens](https://www.au.dk/en/midasnouwens@cc.au.dk), an
    associate professor at Aarhus University in Denmark, who has previously [built
    tools to automatically opt out of tracking by cookie pop-ups](https://www.wired.com/story/avoid-cookie-popups-gdpr/)
    and helped with the website analysis. The data collected can vary by website,
    and the cookie pop-ups allow some control over what can be gathered; however,
    the information can include IP addresses, [fingerprinting of devices](https://www.wired.com/story/browser-fingerprinting-tracking-explained/),
    and various identifiers. “Once they know that, they might add you to different
    data sets, or use it for enrichment later when you go to a different site,” Nouwens
    says.

    in Europe, such as the GDPR, have resulted in websites showing cookie consent
    pop-ups that ask for [permission to store cookies](https://www.wired.com/story/gdpr-cookie-consent-eprivacy/)
    that collect data on your device. In recent years, studies have shown that cookie
    pop-ups have included [dark patterns](https://dl.acm.org/doi/fullHtml/10.1145/3491102.3501985),
    [disregarded people’s choices](https://www-sop.inria.fr/members/Nataliia.Bielova/cookiebanners/),
    and are ignored by people. “Every single person we’ve ever observed in user testing
    doesn't read any of this. They find the fastest way they can to close it out,”
    says Peter Dolanjski, a product director at privacy-focused search engine and
    browser [DuckDuckGo](https://www.wired.com/story/duckduckgo-quest-prove-online-privacy-possible/).
    “So they end up in a worse privacy state.”

- en: For the website analysis, Nouwens scraped the 10,000 most popular websites and
    analyzed whether the collected pop-ups mentioned partners and, if so, the number
    they disclosed. WIRED manually verified all the websites mentioned in this story,
    visiting each to confirm the number of partners they displayed. We looked at the
    highest total number of partners within the whole data set, and the highest number
    of partners for the top 1,000 most popular websites. The process, which is only
    a snapshot of how websites share data, provides one view of the complex ecosystem.
    The results can vary depending on where in the world someone visits a website
    from.

    Many of the world’s biggest websites—think Google, Facebook, and TikTok—use their
    own cookie pop-ups. However, thousands of websites, including publishers and retailers,
    use third-party technology, made by consent management platforms (CMPs), to show
    the pop-ups. These pop-ups largely follow standards from the marketing and advertising
    group IAB Europe, which details the information that should be included in the
    cookie pop-ups.
