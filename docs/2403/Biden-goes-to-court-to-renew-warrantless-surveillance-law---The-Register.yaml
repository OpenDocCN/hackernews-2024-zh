    warrantless surveillance powers used by American intelligence and due to expire
    within weeks. It's a move that is either business as usual or an end-run around
    spying reforms, depending on who in Washington you believe.

    alternative legislation that would allow Section 702 surveillance to continue

    first obtaining a warrant. That prosecutors, under the direction of the White
    House, have gone to court to renew the FISA powers without Congress having a chance
    yet to fully consider Wyden et al's alternatives has left the senator fuming.

    Surveillance Act, that allows US intelligence agencies to spy on foreigners who
    are believed to be a threat to national security, or involved in other criminal
    activities. This is supposed to be limited to intelligence targets overseas, but
    the reality is that communications of some US persons may be warrantlessly swept
    up in these dragnets, and this raises the hackles of privacy advocates.

    sort of guardrails to limit any future abuses. The section was supposed to run
    out at the end of last year, though Congress agreed to a four-month extension.
