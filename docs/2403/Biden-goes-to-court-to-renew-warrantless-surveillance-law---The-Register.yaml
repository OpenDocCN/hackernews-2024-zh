    warrantless surveillance powers used by American intelligence and due to expire
    within weeks. It's a move that is either business as usual or an end-run around
    spying reforms, depending on who in Washington you believe.

    Surveillance Act, that allows US intelligence agencies to spy on foreigners who
    are believed to be a threat to national security, or involved in other criminal
    activities. This is supposed to be limited to intelligence targets overseas, but
    the reality is that communications of some US persons may be warrantlessly swept
