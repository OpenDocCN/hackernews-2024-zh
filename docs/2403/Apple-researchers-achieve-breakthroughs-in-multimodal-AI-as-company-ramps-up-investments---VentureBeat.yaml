    from Multimodal LLM Pre-training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09611)” that was
    quietly posted to arxiv.org this week, demonstrates how carefully combining different

    mix of image-caption, interleaved image-text, and text-only data is crucial for
    achieving state-of-the-art few-shot results across multiple benchmarks,” the researchers
    explain. By training models on a diverse dataset spanning visual and linguistic
    information, the MM1 models were able to excel at tasks like image captioning,
    visual question answering, and natural language inference.

    of input images had a major impact on model performance. “We show that the image
    encoder together with image resolution and the image token count has substantial
    impact, while the vision-language connector design is of comparatively negligible
    importance,” they said. This suggests that continued scaling and refinement of
    the visual components of these multimodal models will be key to unlocking further
    gains.

    learning abilities, allowing it to perform multi-step reasoning over multiple
    input images using few-shot “chain-of-thought” prompting. This points to the potential
    for large multimodal models to tackle complex, open-ended problems that require
    grounded language understanding and generation.

    intelligence in an effort to catch up with rivals like Google, Microsoft, and
    Amazon who have raced ahead in integrating generative AI capabilities into their
    products. The company is on track to spend $1 billion per year on AI development,
    according to a recent [Bloomberg report](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2023-10-22/what-is-apple-doing-in-ai-revamping-siri-search-apple-music-and-other-apps-lo1ffr7p).

    as well as a chatbot known internally as “Apple GPT.” The goal is to integrate
    these technologies into Siri, Messages, Apple Music and other apps and services.
    For example, AI could be used to auto-generate personalized playlists, assist
    developers in writing code, or engage in open-ended conversation and task completion.

- en: Apple has a history of being a fast follower rather than a first mover when
    it comes to major technology shifts. But with AI poised to transform every aspect
    of the digital landscape, the stakes are high for the iPhone maker to stay competitive.
    The MM1 research shows that Apple has the talent and resources to make cutting-edge
    advances. But it remains to be seen if the notoriously secretive company can move
    quickly enough to keep pace in the escalating AI arms race.
