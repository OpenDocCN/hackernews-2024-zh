    drive to flush all buffered data to permanent storage. Applications, such as databases,
    that require a strict ordering of writes should use F_FULLFSYNC to ensure that
    their data is written in the order they expect. Please see fcntl(2) for more detail.

    doesn''t fulfill the durability requirement of ACID: the changes are confirmed
    before the data is fully synchronized.'

    I added support to optionally use `F_BARRIERFSYNC` instead of `F_FULLFSYNC` on
    macOS. By default, `F_FULLSYNC` would still be used as I wanted the user to explicitly
    opt-out of ACID if they needed the extra performance on Apple hardware. This was
    based on the idea that SQLite was using this same approach to achieve its very
    fast speed on macOS.
