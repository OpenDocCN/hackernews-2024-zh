    And writing often needs some “projecting” like making plots. And sometimes I don’t
    get paid for stuff I thought I would and usually projects bleed into each other
    and sometimes I split something I was writing into pieces and I neglect the last
    piece and it [remains in limbo for years](https://dynomight.net/death-penalty/).
    Every level of the hierarchy feels forced and artificial. Maybe there’s a better
    way, but my guess is that life is just too messy.

    Wikis and [Zettelkasten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten) systems let

    however you want. Some people love these. But I reckon that of those who try them—already
    a select group—95% quit within a month. I suspect the reason is partly that more
    flexibility means more decisions and partly that flexibility is a curse as well
    as a blessing—it allows you to better represent the messy world, yes, but it also
    makes your representation less predictable and legible.'
