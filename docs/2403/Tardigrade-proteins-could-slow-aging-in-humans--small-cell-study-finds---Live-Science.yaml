    could potentially be a key ingredient in slowing the aging process in humans,
    scientists claim. However, it will take more work to show these proteins are a
    veritable fountain of youth — for now, the researchers have only early hints from
    lab-dish experiments..

    are near-microscopic, eight-legged creatures known for their practically superhero-like
    ability to withstand extreme conditions, including [tolerating a severe lack of
    water](https://www.livescience.com/tardigrades-survive-drying-out-proteins), [surviving

    and emerging unscathed from [being fired from a gun](https://www.livescience.com/tardigrades-survive-being-shot-gun.html).
    To survive such conditions, tardigrades transform into dehydrated balls and dial
    their metabolisms to near-zero.

    also slow metabolism in human cells in lab dishes, according to a study published
    March 19 in the journal [Protein Science](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/pro.4941).

    like tardigrades, when you put human cells that have these proteins into biostasis,
    they become more resistant to stresses, conferring some of the tardigrades'' abilities
    to the human cells."'

    unfavorable environmental changes, such as surviving for long periods without
    water. The scientists have now demonstrated that the proteins that make biostasis
    possible in tardigrades can have a similar effect on human cells.
