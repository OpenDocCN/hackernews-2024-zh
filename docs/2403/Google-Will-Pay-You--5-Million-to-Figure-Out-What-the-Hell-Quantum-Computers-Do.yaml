    you’re not alone. The truth is, no one knows what modern problems this technology
    can solve. Google launched a multi-year, global competition on Monday to find
    real-world use cases for quantum computing, and the finalists will split $5 million.

    computing, we’re still somewhat in the dark about the full scope of how, when,
    and for which real-world problems this technology will prove most transformative,”
    said Google in a [blog post](https://blog.google/technology/research/google-gesda-and-xprize-launch-new-competition-in-quantum-applications/).
    “We hope launching this prize will help to shed light on these questions.”

    alongside the Geneva Science and Diplomacy Anticipator (GESDA). Twenty finalists
    will share a $1 million prize and advance to the finals. Finalists must then provide
    technical specifications and prove that quantum computing is faster or more accurate
    than traditional computer solutions. The grand prize winners will receive $3 million,
    while runner-ups will split another $1 million prize.

    to an [$866 million industry](https://www.marketsandmarkets.com/Market-Reports/quantum-computing-market-144888301.html#:~:text=The%20global%20quantum%20computing%20market,trend%20analysis%20of%20the%20market.)
    – but we still don’t know what to do with it. Most research around quantum computing
    concerns abstract problems, instead of real-world scenarios. The technology promises
    to [accelerate drug development](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2203533119),
    [uncover secrets about dark matter](https://gizmodo.com/searching-for-dark-matter-with-quantum-computers-one-b-1841476625),
    and help solve [the most fundamental mysteries of the universe](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-11-07/volkswagen-google-cooperate-on-quantum-computing-in-tech-push?sref=P6Q0mxvj).
    But currently, we can’t figure out how it’s more useful than your MacBook.

    trucks and had very few practical uses at all. Quantum computers are still in
    that early stage of development, and they still could revolutionize the world.
    The real question is how.

    computing in three years, but it’s a step in the right direction. Researchers
    can submit near-term applications for today’s quantum computers, Noisy Intermediate
    Scale Quantum (NISQ) processors, and applications for the quantum computers of
    the future.

    by researchers from Google, Amazon, and some of the best universities around the
    world. Hopefully, the competition will produce real-world use cases for the next
    generation of computing, and put this powerful technology to work.
