- en: 'Generative AI like LLMs have been touted as a boon to collective productivity.
    But the authors argue that leaning into the hype too much could be a mistake.
    Assessments of productivity typically focus on the task level and how *individuals*
    might use and benefit from LLMs. Using such findings to draw broad conclusions
    about *firm-level performance* could prove costly. The authors argue that leaders
    need to understand two core problems of LLMs before adopting them company-wide:
    1) their persistent ability to produce convincing falsities and 2) the likely
    long-term negative effects of using LLMs on employees and internal processes.
    The authors outline a long-term perspective on LLMs, as well as what kinds of
    tasks LLMs can perform reliably.  <content js-target="article-content" data-key="ikwsffxwzcjukNq50bdY3Aw6teZ9us8sXjolC2YwQqvEThO6WKu/A8p9hujYzP2X"

    ways to use these tools — and turbocharge productivity — a top priority for many
    companies over the past year. While we are intrigued and impressed by this new
    technology, we advise cautious experimentation instead of wholesale company-wide
    adoption.</content>'
