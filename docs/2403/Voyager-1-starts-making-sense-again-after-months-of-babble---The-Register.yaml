- en: '[On March 1](https://blogs.nasa.gov/sunspot/2024/03/13/nasa-engineers-make-progress-toward-understanding-voyager-1-issue/),
    the Voyager team sent a command, dubbed a "poke," to get the probe''s Flight Data
    System (FDS) to try some other sequences in its software in the hope of circumventing
    whatever had become corrupted.'

    various 1980s games. Not that this hack ever used a `poke` to get [infinite lives

    and might be about to dodge yet another bullet. On March 3, the mission team saw
    something different in the stream of data returned from the spacecraft, which
    had been unreadable since December.

    March 10, the team determined that it contained a complete memory dump from the
    FDS.

    Interstellar Mission, said in a [Pasadena Star-News report](https://www.pasadenastarnews.com/2024/03/09/jpls-voyager-team-extremely-hopeful-after-ailing-faraway-craft-shows-signs-of-former-self/)
    that the data being transmitted from the probe was "not exactly what we would
    expect, but they do look like something that can show us that the FDS is at least
    partially working."

- en: Dodd was referring to the ones and zeroes streaming from the spacecraft. Previously,
    the probe's telemetry modulation unit (TMU) had begun in mid-December [transmitting](https://www.theregister.com/2023/12/14/engineers_work_to_fix_voyager/)
    a repeating binary pattern as though it was somehow stuck. Engineers reckoned
    the issue was somewhere within the FDS.

    before the problem arose. A solution to the issue could then be devised.

    engineers at JPL were determined to get communications with the stricken probe
    working again: "This requires both skills and patience with the long time between
    communication instructions and response."'

- en: The time lag is a problem. A command from Earth takes 22.5 hours to reach the
    probe, and the same period is needed again for a response. This means a 45-hour
    wait to see what a given command might have done.

- en: The availability of skills is also an issue. Many of the engineers who worked
    on the project - Voyager 1 launched in 1977 - are no longer around, and the team
    that remains is faced with trawling through reams of decades-old documents to
    deal with unanticipated issues arising today. ®
