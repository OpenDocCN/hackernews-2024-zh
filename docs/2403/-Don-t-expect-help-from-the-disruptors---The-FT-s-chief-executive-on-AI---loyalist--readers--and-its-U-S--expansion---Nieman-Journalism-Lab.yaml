    propensity to read particular articles, and present those articles. Personalization
    will become even more important with AI in driving engagement. And, of course,
    there’s the basic, almost virtuous, circle that the more engaged readers we get,
    the more data we have to work with in terms of understanding the drivers of engagement.

    between consumer subscriptions and corporate or institutional subscriptions. Rethink
    the product position. Rethink the pricing. I think the particular power of that
    professional division is that you really can reach a deep understanding of the
    organization’s information needs and you become part of the decision making process.

    supports it. And it’s unfortunate because there’s actually a real opportunity
    to do the right thing. You ground or validate AI programs, you pay providers of
    quality journalism to affect that grounding, and I think this validation represents
    a significant difference from the intellectual property wars round one, which
    was all about the volume of traffic online. There’s a mutual interest in the verification
    and validation of Gen AI content against trusted sources.

    big tech and, at the same time, the justification when they talk about the challenges
    of paying license fees or even engaging in the same level that they did with news
    media. They talk about “financial pressures,” which, you know, you want to say
    “seriously”? The individual revenues for each of these big players, and their
    net income, probably match those of the news media industry in total.

    in the same way that you can’t dictate your parents. But the approach that has
    been validated by that ownership model — i.e. sustained support for quality journalism
    and engagement-based growth as an effective strategy — is of broader relevance
    to news media, whatever the ownership set-up.

    Our platform was on fire, we were seeing structural change in key revenue lines
    that was moving fast and deep, and we were breakeven — or not even breakeven,
    in some phases. So we had to make some big calls, fast. Ultimately in moments
    like that, you have to think very hard about what is your core value and ours
    was brilliant journalism. So we weren’t going to give it away. We were going to
    double down, raise prices, and charge for that journalism online – even though
    that was controversial at a time when the mantra was “the Internet wants to be
    free.” It quite quickly became apparent that alongside the online revenues, and
    just as valuable, was the data and insight into our readers that the new subscription
    model generated.
