    we’ve had a dominant male readership. There was a need and an opportunity to build
    our readership among women. The way we wanted to go about that was not through
    having special sections or whatever, but to make our overall coverage more relevant
    and more engaging. Women are around a third of all our subscribers now and the
    total number of engaged women subscribers is now about 130,000\. That’s a big

    One of the ways we’re doing that is through a schools program where we make a
    formatted version of the FT — which is easier to navigate, but it’s FT journalism
    — free to secondary schools and above. That’s now in around 7,000 schools in 120-plus
