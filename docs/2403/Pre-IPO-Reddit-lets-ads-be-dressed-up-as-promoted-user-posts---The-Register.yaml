    for brands to craft and run adverts that look a lot like normal user posts on
    the social network.

- en: Called "free-form ads," Reddit said in an [announcement](https://www.redditinc.com/blog/advertise-like-a-redditor-with-our-all-new-completely-unique-ad-format-free-form-ads)
    this week that the "all-new, completely unique ad format" is designed to improve
    click-through rates and upvotes – by making the adverts look as much like user
    posts as possible.

- en: What's happening here is that advertisers can use the Reddit Ads Manager to
    create adverts that have all the qualities of normal user posts – photos, videos,
    lists, megathreads, etc – and then pay to make them appear prominently on the
    site and in the app as promoted posts, aka adverts. Up until now, brands typically
    have had to book an ad that links out to an external site, such as a landing page
    selling some stuff, or an ad that links to a separate user post on Reddit, or
    a banner ad. Those options are still available though not as fully featured as
    free-form ads.

- en: Free-form ads instead look like normal, content-packed posts in people's feeds,
    with a promoted label, rather than a link off to somewhere else, and are crafted
    via the Ads Manager. There's no need to create a separate user post that an ad
    links to, for instance.

    which include Just Eat Takeaway, Kraft Heinz, and Leica, all of which found the
    format capable of "driving upper funnel results." Reddit claimed free-form ads
    tested so far achieved a 28 percent increase in click-through rates, which the
    biz noted "outperform[ed] all other ad types."

    engagement, Reddit claimed, without indicating whether that increase was positive
    or not. Reddit said Philadelphia Cream Cheese, a brand owned by Kraft Heinz, had
    success with the format though it declined to go into specifics about that trial.

    versatility, with product details and recipe inspiration," Reddit said. "This
    effectively prompted the Reddit community to ''get a big list going and bond over''
    their shared love of cream cheese."'

    had "a 91 percent upvote rate and a 42 percent higher click-through rate from
    the brand's previous Reddit benchmark," and that the post generated "over a thousand
    comments in a single month."

    and 1.1K comments. The [more recent one](https://www.reddit.com/user/PhillyCreamCheese/comments/16hxm0s/help_us_fill_this_thread_with_ways_you_use_philly/)
    from PhillyCreamCheese, on the other hand, got 617 comments and zero points, though
    it's likely to us that score was fixed at zero.

- en: All free-form adverts are supposed to show some kind of sponsored label, though
    that doesn't appear to be the case on the three posts included in this story.
    While Leica's shows it, neither Philadelphia post includes a tag indicating it's
    sponsored content. We understand that's because the Philadelphia posts are no
    longer boosted by ad spending, so are back to just being normal user posts.

    to ingest user content for the purposes of training AI models after making its
