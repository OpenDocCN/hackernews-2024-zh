    under the username "elonmuskwhm." In conversations with the bitcoin trader, investigators
    sent links to public YouTube tutorials on mapping via drones and augmented reality
    software, *Forbes* details. The videos were watched more than 30,000 times, presumably
    by thousands of users unrelated to the case.

    ordered by federal investigators to quietly hand over all such viewer data for
    the period of Jan. 1 to Jan. 8, 2023, but *Forbes* couldn't confirm if Google
    had complied.

    Federal investigators argued the request was legally justified as the data "would
    be relevant and material to an ongoing criminal investigation, including by providing
    identification information about the perpetrators," citing justification used
    by other police forces around the country. In a case out of New Hampshire, police
    requested similar data during the investigation of bomb threats that were being
    streamed live to YouTube — the order specifically requested viewership information
    at select time stamps during the live streams.

    the privacy and constitutional rights of our users while supporting the important
    work of law enforcement," Google spokesperson Matt Bryant told *Forbes*. "We examine
    each demand for legal validity, consistent with developing case law, and we routinely
    push back against over broad or otherwise inappropriate demands for user data,
    including objecting to some demands entirely."'

    order creates, citing concerns over the protections of the first and fourth amendments.
    "This is the latest chapter in a disturbing trend where we see government agencies
    increasingly transforming search warrants into digital dragnets," executive director
    of the [Surveillance Technology Oversight Project](https://www.stopspying.org/
    "(opens in a new window)") Albert Fox-Cahn told the publication. "It’s unconstitutional,
    it’s terrifying, and it’s happening every day."

    to allow users to save their location data directly to their devices rather than
    the cloud, and shortened the retention time for such storage — the new policies
    also indirectly stunted the long-used investigatory workaround in which [law enforcement
    officials use Google location data](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/10/24/google-privacy-police-geofence/

    two state supreme court cases surrounding the [constitutionality of keyword search
    warrants](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/keyword-search-warrants-and-the-fourth-amendment/
    "(opens in a new window)"), which force sites to turn over an individual's internet
