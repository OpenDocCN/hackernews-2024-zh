    surprise warming in the upper atmosphere triggered a major reversal event earlier
    this month. It is one of the most extreme atmospheric U-turns seen in recent memory.

    "big freeze." But the sudden switch-up has caused a record-breaking "ozone spike"

- en: The polar vortex is most prominent during winter months and extends into the
    stratosphere — the second layer of the atmosphere up to around 30 miles (50 kilometers)
    above the surface. The vortex spins counterclockwise with wind speeds of around
    155 mph (250 km/h), which is around the same speed as a Category 5 hurricane,
    according to the [U.K. Met Office](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/weather/learn-about/weather/atmosphere/polar-vortex).
    A similar vortex also encircles Antarctica during the southern winter.

- en: Polar vortices occasionally reverse temporarily. These events can last for days,
    weeks or months and are caused by sudden stratospheric warming (SSW), when the
    temperatures in the stratosphere climb by as much as 90 degrees Fahrenheit (50
    degrees Celsius) in the space of a couple of days, according to the [Met Office](https://blog.metoffice.gov.uk/2013/01/08/what-is-a-sudden-stratospheric-warming-ssw/).

    in the atmosphere — compression waves formed when air rises into a region of different
    density and is pushed back downward by the force of Earth's spin. This process
    disrupts or reverses the vortex flow.

    are starting to slow down, hinting that the vortex will return to its normal trajectory
    soon, [Spaceweather.com reported](https://www.spaceweather.com/archive.php?view=1&day=20&month=03&year=2024).

    and author of [NOAA''s new polar vortex blog](https://www.climate.gov/news-features/blogs/polar-vortex/it-was-perfect-winter-launch-polar-vortex-blog),
    told Spaceweather.com. The speed of the reversed winds puts the event in the top
    six on record, she added.'

    descended [across the Midwest](https://www.livescience.com/64638-why-polar-vortex-midwest.html).
    These extreme weather events occur when the polar vortex deforms the jet stream
    — an air current that surrounds the polar vortex — exposing lower latitudes to
    large blobs of icy Arctic air.

    patterns are expected to remain largely unaffected, according to Spaceweather.com.

    amounts of [ozone](https://www.livescience.com/ozone.html) from lower latitudes,
    creating a temporary ozone spike — the opposite of an ozone hole. Currently, there
    is more ozone surrounding the Arctic than at this time during any other year on
    record, according to Spaceweather.com. However, this ozone spike will disappear
    after the polar vortex returns to normal

    or La Niña, the two contrasting phases of a natural cycle of planet-wide warming
    and cooling. During these phases, global weather systems become more unstable,
    which sets the stage for more frequent reversal events, Butler wrote in the NOAA
    blog.
