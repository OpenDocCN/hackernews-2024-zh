    most famous for writing the wonderful [Cuckoo''s Egg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cuckoo%27s_Egg_(book))
    about tracking a hacker when doing so was almost recreational) runs a business
    making Klein bottles: [Acme Klein Bottle](https://www.kleinbottle.com/). A Klein
    bottle is a weird shape (that doesn''t actually exist in three dimensions) with
    only one side. A bottle with no inside and outside. A bit like the [Möbius strip](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%B6bius_strip)
    has only one side.'

    their edges. Unfortunately, that doesn't actually work in three dimensions so
    we're left with doing something called "immersing" the bottle in our three dimensional
    world.
