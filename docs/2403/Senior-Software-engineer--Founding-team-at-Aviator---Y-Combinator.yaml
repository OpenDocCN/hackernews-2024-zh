- en: We are specifically looking for engineers who can see inefficiencies in today’s
    developer workflows and want to improve developer experience for everyone. These
    engineers are self-motivated and opinionated about developer experience. We believe
    in the ethos of "Strong opinions loosely held".

- en: We love to do all technical interviews in a similar fashion. Depending on your
    timeline and our teams availability, these may be scheduled back to back or spaced
    out. You should expect a total of 3-4 technical interviews with a mix of programming
    + system design questions. Each interview is 1 hour long, with 45mins for technical
    question and 15 mins for Q&A.

    using your preferred IDE and your preferred programming language. You may also
    use Google search if you want to look for a specific reference. The goal here
    is to see how would you solve such problems in a typical workday.
