    developer workflows and want to improve developer experience for everyone. These
    engineers are self-motivated and opinionated about developer experience. We believe
    in the ethos of "Strong opinions loosely held".

    timeline and our teams availability, these may be scheduled back to back or spaced
    out. You should expect a total of 3-4 technical interviews with a mix of programming
    + system design questions. Each interview is 1 hour long, with 45mins for technical
    question and 15 mins for Q&A.

    using your preferred IDE and your preferred programming language. You may also
    use Google search if you want to look for a specific reference. The goal here
    is to see how would you solve such problems in a typical workday.
