- en: In the early 1950s, the physicist Frederick Reines and his colleague Clyde Cowan
    designed an experiment to detect neutrinos, the tiniest and most elusive of subatomic
    particles. Theorists were convinced that neutrinos must exist — and that they
    would be untraceable. And Reines liked nothing better than a challenge.

- en: The experiment was to take place in the Nevada desert. A flux of neutrinos would
    be created by detonating a 20-kiloton nuclear bomb, comparable to that dropped
    on Hiroshima, Japan, a few years earlier. A deep hole would be dug 40 metres away
    from the detonation site, into which a detector would be dropped at the moment
    of explosion to catch the flux at its maximum.

    the government-funded Los Alamos laboratory in New Mexico. Work began on the detector,
    nicknamed El Monstro, and on the construction of the shaft. At the last minute,
    Reines and Cowan transferred the experiment to a nuclear reactor, but not because
    of environmental or safety concerns. They had worked out that although the reactor
    would deliver a flux of neutrinos three orders of magnitude lower than that from
    the bomb, it offered a better option for distinguishing signal from noise.

    Carolina, and Reines and Cowan became the first scientists to detect neutrinos.
    In 1995, Reines won a share of the Nobel Prize in Physics. (Cowan had died by
    then.)

- en: The idea of including a nuclear bomb in a basic-research protocol might sound
    outlandish, but in Chasing the Ghost, his biography of Reines, Leonard Cole reminds
    us that attitudes were different then. He also reminds us of this when describing
    Reines’s work on nuclear bombs during and after the Second World War, and his
    creation of a neutrino laboratory deep in a gold mine in South Africa in the 1960s,
    in defiance of academic sanctions against the apartheid state. (However, Cole
    is hardly an independent voice, being Reines’s admiring younger cousin.)

    clear that these elementary particles are key to understanding the physics of
    the Universe. Reines was probably its most rambunctious member. Cole relies on
    many written sources in his reconstruction of Reines’s life. He also interviewed
    scientists, many now in their nineties, who worked with him. He builds a picture
    of a larger-than-life figure who conducted larger-than-life experiments. The man
    who rises off the page is an inspiring, supportive colleague and an entertainingly
    boisterous companion, who whistled and sang his way through life.

    immigrants. He was a self-confident high achiever from his youth, declaring in
    his high-school yearbook his ambition “to be a physicist extraordinary”. He was
    also a gifted gymnast and musician, who considered a career as an opera singer.

    nuclear fission, a subject so sensitive that publication of his PhD thesis was
    delayed until after the war. He joined the Los Alamos laboratory in 1944 to work
    on the Manhattan Project, the US effort to develop an atomic bomb led by some
    of the world’s top physicists. Most left Los Alamos after the war; not Reines.
    He continued to work on the radiation emissions of nuclear bombs — above-ground
    atomic tests were still taking place, in Nevada and on remote atolls in the Pacific
    Ocean — and on the development of the even more powerful hydrogen bomb.

    to be well funded, and investigations into fundamental physics were encouraged.
    Reines’s neutrino fixation began when he took a year’s sabbatical from his daily
    responsibilities and found a like-minded colleague in Cowan.

- en: Neutrinos were nicknamed ghost particles because of their uncanny properties.
    They are the most abundant particles in the Universe — around 100 trillion pass
    harmlessly through your body every second. They are created in many natural processes,
    including nuclear reactions in the Sun, explosions of stars and processes that
    generate radioactivity in Earth’s core. They are also made by particle accelerators
    and nuclear power plants.

    when they interact with another particle. Detectors are made from liquids that
    generate a suitable signal, such as a flash of light, during interactions, and
    electronics that convert the signal to an electrical pulse. Neutrino interactions
    are exceedingly rare, however, so the detectors have to be very large, and physicists
    very patient.

    at a plutonium-producing reactor in Hanford, Washington. The results were inconclusive.
    Undeterred, they transported their bulky yet delicate equipment — including a
    detector tank containing more than 1 tonne of scintillation fluid — in a crawling
    convoy of 5 oversized trucks, travelling 2,600 kilometres to the more powerful
    Savannah River reactor, which they expected to deliver a larger flux of neutrinos.
    In June 1956, they declared their success.

    years later, he moved to the University of California, Irvine. At Case, he began
    a search for natural-source neutrinos, for which he had to build an underground
    laboratory, sheltered from interfering cosmic radiation. He targeted the East
    Rand gold mine near Johannesburg, South Africa, which coiled more than 3.5 kilometres
    below Earth’s surface.

    and dangerous conditions for the miners, who — unlike the scientists — wore no
    protective gear beyond a hard hat. It took six months of blasting to create the
    required horizontal space. They had to transport newly built equipment from the
    Case Institute, including 20 tonnes of scintillation fluid in 50 containment tanks,
    which proved a logistical nightmare. But by 1965, the lab was detecting atmospheric
    neutrinos.

    Some other African countries alleged that it intended to test nuclear weapons
    underground. As that issue faded, problems arose at home, writes Cole. In 1968,
    colleagues at Irvine openly challenged academic collaboration in an explicitly
    racist country. Reines countered that, in his view, science transcended politics.
    Still, he wound down research at the mine soon afterwards, and continued his neutrino
    studies at US sites.

    how they were resolved. He also scatters descriptions of the relevant physics
    rather unsatisfactorily across chapters.

- en: Nonetheless, Chasing the Ghost nicely describes how successful the derring-do
    attitude of individual researchers can be. Reines variously comes across as endearing,
    admirable and irritating. He could alarm his team by tugging on cables to test
    electronics as he whistled his way through a lab, and was quick to over-interpret
    results. But he was a hands-off, respectful lab chief who addressed his team with
    old-fashioned formality as ‘Mr’ (they seem to have all been men) — even as he
    ignored their rights to holidays. Those interviewed all tell how they fell under
    his spell, and worked hard to please him. One anecdote has him on one knee, singing
    an aria at a party. Unlike his neutrinos, it seems, Reines was always an unmistakable
    presence.
