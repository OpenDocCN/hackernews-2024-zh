    the episode with the legendary programmer [John Carmack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I845O57ZSy4)
    has an unhinged director’s-cut feel to it. Over five hours, Carmack dishes on
    everything from vector operations to *Doom*. But it’s something Fridman says,
    offhand, that really justifies the extended run time: “I think that if we’re living
    [in a simulation](https://www.wired.com/story/living-in-a-simulation/), it’s written
    in JavaScript.”'

    the internet would resemble nothing so much as an after-hours arcade, lifeless
    and dark. These days, the language is used in both front- and backend development
    for a whole host of mobile platforms and apps, including Slack and Discord. And
    the main thing to understand about it, in the context of Fridman’s nerdy koan,
    is this: For any self-respecting programmer, admitting to actually *liking* JavaScript
    is something of a faux pas—much like an art-house filmmaker confessing to Marvel
    fandom.'

    in less time than it takes to home-brew a jar of kombucha: 10 days. In 1995, Netscape
    hired a programmer named Brendan Eich to create a language to embed in its browser,
    Netscape Navigator. Originally called LiveScript, the language was renamed JavaScript
    to piggyback on the hype around an unrelated language called Java, which had been
    introduced earlier that year. (Asked the difference between Java and JavaScript,
    a programmer is likely to joke: “Java is to JavaScript what car is to carpet.”)
    To this day, few people consider JavaScript a particularly well-designed language,
    least of all Eich. “I perpetrated JavaScript in 1995,” he once said, “and I’ve
    been making up for it ever since.”'

    and Reddit threads sandbagging JavaScript, but my favorite is a [four-minute talk](https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/wat)
    by software engineer Gary Bernhardt titled “Wat.” Imagine, for starters, showing
    a group of non-English speakers the present and past forms of verbs like *boil*
    (*boil*/*boiled*) and *chew* (*chew*/*chewed*). Then, when you ask them for the
    conjugation of *eat*, who could blame them for answering *eat*/*eated*? Similarly,
    the “Wat” talk is a blooper reel of JavaScript’s quirks and unpredictable behaviors.
    Let’s say you want to sort a list of numbers: [50, 100, 1, 10, 9, 5]. Calling
    the built-in sort function in any sane language returns the list in numerically
    ascending order: [1, 5, 9, 10, 50, 100]. Doing so in JavaScript returns [1, 10,
    100, 5, 50, 9], where 10 and 100 are considered larger than 5\. Why? Because JavaScript
    interprets each number as a string type and does lexical sorting, not numerical
    sorting. Total insanity.'

    that our world is, like the underlying source code, massively screwed up and incomprehensible.
    It’s the equivalent of pronouncing, with a sigh, that considering the sorry state
    of the planet, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights must have been written
    in Comic Sans.

- en: At this point, I should confess that while JavaScript is not my favorite language,
    I like it. Adore it, in fact. So I can’t help but feel a flare of disapproval
    whenever a certain fraternity of programmers polemicizes against it. Often they
    focus on flaws that were dealt with years ago. To dwell on JavaScript’s original
    shortcomings is to overlook the fact that any piece of software—and every programming
    language is, in essence, a suite of software—is amenable to revision and improvement.
