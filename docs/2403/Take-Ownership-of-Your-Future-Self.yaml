- en: 'Your personality, skills, likes, and dislikes change over time — but that change
    isn’t out of your control. What can you do to become the version of yourself that
    you most want to be? Start by acknowledging the differences between your past,
    current, and future selves. Next, imagine your desired future self: Set goals
    that are as clear and specific as possible to maximize your chances of achieving
    them. Finally, develop (and re-develop) an identity narrative consistent with
    the person you want to become — and share that story with others! Your identity
    drives your behavior, which over time creates your personality. So start acting
    like the best version of yourself, and you will become that person.'
