- en: Researchers at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) have discovered that
    symptoms of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are tied to atypical
    interactions between the brain’s frontal cortex and information processing centers
    deep in the brain. The researchers examined more than 10,000 functional brain
    images of youth with ADHD and published their results in the *American Journal
    of Psychiatry*. The study was led by researchers at NIH’s National Institute of
    Mental Health (NIMH) and National Human Genome Research Institute.

    and colleagues analyzed brain images supplied by more than 8,000 youth with and
    without ADHD sourced from six different functional imaging datasets. Using these
    images, the researchers examined associations between functional brain connectivity
    and ADHD symptoms.

- en: They found that youth with ADHD had heightened connectivity between structures
    deep in the brain involved in learning, movement, reward, and emotion (caudate,
    putamen, and nucleus accumbens seeds) and structures in the frontal area of the
    brain involved in attention and control of unwanted behaviors (superior temporal
    gyri, insula, inferior parietal lobe, and inferior frontal gyri).

- en: While neuroscience researchers have long suspected that ADHD symptoms result
    from atypical interactions between the frontal cortex and these deep information-processing
    brain structures, studies testing this model have returned mixed findings, possibly
    due to the small nature of the studies, with only 100 or so subjects. Researchers
    suggest that the smaller studies may not have been able to reliably detect the
    brain interactions leading to the complex behaviors seen in ADHD.
