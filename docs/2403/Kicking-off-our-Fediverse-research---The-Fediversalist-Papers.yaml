    officially begins this month, so we’ve made an informal federated blog to communicate
    about the work—welcome to that!

    and [why we’re doing it](https://erinkissane.com/root-and-branch) on our own sites,
    so here’s a brief recap. Our official research question is: “What are the most
    effective governance and administration models/structures in place on medium-to-large
    sized Fediverse servers, and what infrastructural gaps (human and digital) persist?”
    Darius wrote us a back-of-the-napkin mission statement as well:'

    of the Fediverse. We are going to do the best job we can to capture how prepared
    (and how unprepared) they are to deal with the risks they face. Then we are going
    to make strong recommendations for how open source projects, philanthropic funders,
    civil society organizations, and others can co-create a Fediverse that is safer
    and better for humanity than the social media we've been stuck with for two decades.

    with about half a dozen server admin/mod teams from around the world, and right
    now, we’re in the process of building our longlist of server teams, from which
    that final half-dozen teams will be drawn. We’re working toward a final list that’s
    balanced across factors like size (we plan to include servers ranging from about
    monthly active users with flex on either end as needed to explore a rich sample
    of experiences), location, primary language(s), demographics, and governance and
    administrative structure.

- en: 'Supplementing our main research stream will be lighter discussions and surveys
    targeting groups like: members of Fediverse servers; organizations and institutions
    working on Fediverse governance, administration, and tooling; and community leaders
    and stewards from adjacent networks and communities. In our in-depth interviews
    and other conversations, we’ll prioritize full disclosure and informed consent—and
    more broadly, we’ll be making our best effort to capture the most accurate, genuine,
    and nuanced representation of the views, concerns, and hopes of the people who
    contribute to this effort. (We’ll redact individual identities in certain cases,
    and all decisions about identity will be made in consultation with the people
    we speak with.)'

    people interested in Fediverse governance, recommendations to funders and institution-builders
    on the needs and risks facing Fediverse administrators, and our final report to
    DIIF—and all our findings will be public and freely available.

  zh: 该项目的发现将采取几种形式，包括面向对 Fediverse 治理感兴趣的人的手册，向资助者和机构建设者推荐关于面对 Fediverse 管理者的需求和风险的建议，以及我们向
    DIIF 的最终报告——我们的所有发现都将是公开的并且免费提供。
