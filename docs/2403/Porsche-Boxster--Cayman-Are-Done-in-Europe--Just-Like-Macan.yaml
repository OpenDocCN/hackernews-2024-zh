- en: 'Several months after [Porsche](https://www.thedrive.com/category/porsche-news)
    announced that its [Macan](https://www.thedrive.com/car-reviews/2023-porsche-macan-t-review-features-price-options)
    compact SUV would be discontinued in Europe due to cybersecurity laws there, the
    German automaker has confirmed that the very same regulation will essentially
    kill the existing 718 pair—Boxster and Cayman. That''s right: Porsche''s most
    accessible gas-powered sports cars are bidding farewell two years [before their
    electric replacements debut](https://www.thedrive.com/news/porsche-says-it-cannot-let-electric-718-cayman-weigh-4000-pounds).'

    news to [*Motor1*](https://www.motor1.com/news/713634/porsche-718-boxster-cayman-discontinued-europe/)
    after the German press first reported it last week. Notably, this decision won't
    entirely spell the end for the mid-engined sports cars, as the [Cayman GT4 RS](https://www.thedrive.com/new-cars/44863/2022-porsche-718-cayman-gt4-rs-first-drive-review-makes-a-hero-out-of-you)

    will be able to skirt the rule given their limited production volume. Still, the
    very fact these icons of Porsche's modern era will largely be unavailable for
    sale in the manufacturer's home market is as hard to believe as it is depressing.

    attributable to UN Regulation No. 155 (UN R155), which will take effect on July
    1\. UN R155 doesn't merely require automakers to embed certain cybersecurity protections
    inside the car; it requires them to completely change the way they develop vehicles—as
    they can't seek type approval without mitigating cybersecurity risks at multiple
    points along the development process—*and* show their work if faced with an audit.

    to meet compliance. The effort would be as costly as it would be time consuming,
    considering the current Macan and 718 hit the market in 2014 and 2016, respectively,
    and both nameplates will be [Stuttgart's next to go all-in](https://www.thedrive.com/car-reviews/2025-porsche-macan-ev-first-ride-review)

    this regulation, the industry often pays more attention to the in-vehicle implications,"
    David Mor-Ofek of software provider C2A Security wrote in a [blog](https://c2a-sec.com/porsche-to-halt-macan-suv-sales-in-europe-over-regulatory-concerns/)
    following news of the Macan's discontinuation. "But the organizational effort
    is much broader and expensive. Especially in an industry governed by a complex
    supply chain, with [more than] 100 suppliers, establishing proper processes and
    protocols to manage risk throughout the vehicle lifecycle can prove too much for
    some [manufacturers]."

    killing off some of Porsche's final models with internal combustion engines aren't
    a factor here. In fact, Porsche North America was planning to retire the current
    Macan next year or in 2026, around the time of the EV successor's global arrival.
    However, the company may have adjusted that timeline for us, according to *[Automotive
    News](https://www.autonews.com/dealers/porsches-plan-ditch-ice-macan-europe-win-us)*,
    to sell Macans of both powertrains concurrently since [EV sales aren't exactly
    sterling](https://www.thedrive.com/news/were-finally-crossing-the-chasm-with-electric-vehicles)
    at the moment. Maybe Porsche's entry-level sports cars will also receive a similar
    stay of execution, but regardless—if you want one, it seems like you've got just
    a few years to make your move.
