    announced that its [Macan](https://www.thedrive.com/car-reviews/2023-porsche-macan-t-review-features-price-options)
    compact SUV would be discontinued in Europe due to cybersecurity laws there, the
    German automaker has confirmed that the very same regulation will essentially
    kill the existing 718 pair—Boxster and Cayman. That''s right: Porsche''s most
    accessible gas-powered sports cars are bidding farewell two years [before their
    electric replacements debut](https://www.thedrive.com/news/porsche-says-it-cannot-let-electric-718-cayman-weigh-4000-pounds).'

  zh: 几个月后，[保时捷](https://www.thedrive.com/category/porsche-news)宣布由于欧洲的网络安全法规，其[Macan](https://www.thedrive.com/car-reviews/2023-porsche-macan-t-review-features-price-options)紧凑型SUV将停产，德国汽车制造商确认这一法规基本上将结束现有的718系列——Boxster和Cayman。没错：保时捷最具可及性的燃油运动车型在其电动替代品推出两年前就告别了。

    news to [*Motor1*](https://www.motor1.com/news/713634/porsche-718-boxster-cayman-discontinued-europe/)
    after the German press first reported it last week. Notably, this decision won't
    entirely spell the end for the mid-engined sports cars, as the [Cayman GT4 RS](https://www.thedrive.com/new-cars/44863/2022-porsche-718-cayman-gt4-rs-first-drive-review-makes-a-hero-out-of-you)

    will be able to skirt the rule given their limited production volume. Still, the
    very fact these icons of Porsche's modern era will largely be unavailable for
    sale in the manufacturer's home market is as hard to believe as it is depressing.

  zh: 保时捷718系列发言人Oliver Hilger最近在德国媒体首次报道后向[*Motor1*](https://www.motor1.com/news/713634/porsche-718-boxster-cayman-discontinued-europe/)传达了这一消息。值得注意的是，这个决定并不会完全意味着中置引擎跑车的终结，因为[Cayman
    GT4 RS](https://www.thedrive.com/new-cars/44863/2022-porsche-718-cayman-gt4-rs-first-drive-review-makes-a-hero-out-of-you)和[Boxster
    Spyder RS](https://www.thedrive.com/news/the-2024-porsche-boxster-spyder-rs-packs-493-hp-revs-to-howling-9000-rpm)将因其有限的生产量而能够逃脱规则的约束。然而，保时捷现代化时代的这些标志性车型在其制造商的主要市场中大部分时间无法购买，这一事实既难以置信又令人沮丧。
- en: Like the situation that faced the Macan, the 718's cancellation is directly
    attributable to UN Regulation No. 155 (UN R155), which will take effect on July
    1\. UN R155 doesn't merely require automakers to embed certain cybersecurity protections
    inside the car; it requires them to completely change the way they develop vehicles—as
    they can't seek type approval without mitigating cybersecurity risks at multiple
    points along the development process—*and* show their work if faced with an audit.

- en: In other words, this is a systemic problem, not merely a product one. "With
    this regulation, the industry often pays more attention to the in-vehicle implications,"
    David Mor-Ofek of software provider C2A Security wrote in a [blog](https://c2a-sec.com/porsche-to-halt-macan-suv-sales-in-europe-over-regulatory-concerns/)
    following news of the Macan's discontinuation. "But the organizational effort
    is much broader and expensive. Especially in an industry governed by a complex
    supply chain, with [more than] 100 suppliers, establishing proper processes and
    protocols to manage risk throughout the vehicle lifecycle can prove too much for
    some [manufacturers]."

- en: Meanwhile, buyers on these shores will be relieved to know that the regulations
    killing off some of Porsche's final models with internal combustion engines aren't
    a factor here. In fact, Porsche North America was planning to retire the current
    Macan next year or in 2026, around the time of the EV successor's global arrival.
    However, the company may have adjusted that timeline for us, according to *[Automotive
    News](https://www.autonews.com/dealers/porsches-plan-ditch-ice-macan-europe-win-us)*,
    to sell Macans of both powertrains concurrently since [EV sales aren't exactly
    sterling](https://www.thedrive.com/news/were-finally-crossing-the-chasm-with-electric-vehicles)
    at the moment. Maybe Porsche's entry-level sports cars will also receive a similar
    stay of execution, but regardless—if you want one, it seems like you've got just
    a few years to make your move.
