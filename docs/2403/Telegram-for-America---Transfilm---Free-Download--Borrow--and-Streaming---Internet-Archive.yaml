- en: A well produced film Samuel F.B. Morse's invention made America a distinct leader
    when his development became the International Morse Code. And Western Union took
    that to new heights in the '30's through the '60's. The film predates Westar by
    about 20 years, and that is probably good, as the company started to lose insight,
    and began to lose money. If they could have retained cutting-edge top management,
    they could be near or at the top of the telecom industry today. But of course,
    when Lee Iaccoca says; "Where have all the Leaders Gone", Technology always wins.

    off a higher floor, difficult to tell for certain but going frame by frame does
    show what appears to be someone jumping from that burning building. **Reviewer:**

- en: A fun overview of a service that doesn't exist anymore! This film is all about
    Western Union. Yes boys and girls, before you cou;d get your money in an instant
    using their service (well, a couple of hours) WU was your telegraph service. You
    want a crane? Telegraph it! You want to report news of your wife's birth! By gum,
    Western Union was the only way! This film details of the many different telegraph
    services available, and how it gets from one place to another. You can have a
    private telegraph service if you want to! (Well, you have to be like a bank).
    Also, again, this film gets into facsimile service, something of which I never
    knew existed in the 1950's. Very odd to be proven wrong on this one. (Well, it's
    just very odd to be proven wrong period). Also, the film briefly talks about sending
    the news by wire, and shows some storms, sports scenes and fires. Watch one of
    the fire scenes very carefully. Is someone jumping out of a building to their
    deaths? The camera follows something down, I am not too sure what it is, if it
    is what I think it is, then wow.

  zh: 这部影片是对一项已不复存在的服务的有趣概述！影片主要讲述的是西联公司。是的，男孩们和女孩们，在你们能够使用即时服务拿到钱（好吧，大约几个小时）之前，WU曾是你们的电报服务。你想要一台起重机吗？用电报通知！你想要报告你妻子生孩子的消息吗！通过天哪，西联公司是唯一的选择！这部影片详细介绍了许多不同的电报服务，并且它们是如何从一地传送到另一地的。如果你愿意，你也可以拥有私人电报服务！（嗯，你得像一个银行一样）。此外，这部影片还介绍了复制服务，这是我在上世纪50年代从未听说过的东西。在这一点上被证明是错误的感觉非常奇怪。
    （嗯，被证明错误本身就非常奇怪）。此外，影片简要地谈到了通过电报发送新闻，并展示了一些风暴、体育场景和火灾。请仔细观看其中的一场火灾场景。有人从建筑物跳下来吗？镜头跟随某物坠落，我不太确定它是什么，如果它是我所认为的那样，那么哇。
