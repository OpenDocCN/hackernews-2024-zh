- en: A well produced film Samuel F.B. Morse's invention made America a distinct leader
    when his development became the International Morse Code. And Western Union took
    that to new heights in the '30's through the '60's. The film predates Westar by
    about 20 years, and that is probably good, as the company started to lose insight,
    and began to lose money. If they could have retained cutting-edge top management,
    they could be near or at the top of the telecom industry today. But of course,
    when Lee Iaccoca says; "Where have all the Leaders Gone", Technology always wins.

    off a higher floor, difficult to tell for certain but going frame by frame does
    show what appears to be someone jumping from that burning building. **Reviewer:**

- en: A fun overview of a service that doesn't exist anymore! This film is all about
    Western Union. Yes boys and girls, before you cou;d get your money in an instant
    using their service (well, a couple of hours) WU was your telegraph service. You
    want a crane? Telegraph it! You want to report news of your wife's birth! By gum,
    Western Union was the only way! This film details of the many different telegraph
    services available, and how it gets from one place to another. You can have a
    private telegraph service if you want to! (Well, you have to be like a bank).
    Also, again, this film gets into facsimile service, something of which I never
    knew existed in the 1950's. Very odd to be proven wrong on this one. (Well, it's
    just very odd to be proven wrong period). Also, the film briefly talks about sending
    the news by wire, and shows some storms, sports scenes and fires. Watch one of
    the fire scenes very carefully. Is someone jumping out of a building to their
    deaths? The camera follows something down, I am not too sure what it is, if it
    is what I think it is, then wow.
