    that thing you always automatically click 'agree' to whenever any of your software
    gets updated, now [explicitly prohibits](https://www.techradar.com/televisions/streaming-devices/your-roku-tv-and-streaming-stick-will-stop-working-unless-you-agree-to-controversial-new-terms)
    you from taking part in any class-action lawsuits. Instead, you agree to waive
    those rights in favor of binding arbitration. So far, that's all pretty standard.
    Companies from all industries have been doing this for years. But for Roku, it's
    only the start. This is where its legal shenanigans start to get really interesting.

    up," [David Siegel](https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-siegel-a271265/), a partner
    at [Grellas Shah, LLP](https://grellas.com/), told Lifewire via email. "[T]he
    law firm files those thousands of claims in arbitration, requiring the defendant
    (the online service provider—like Roku) to pay millions of dollars in arbitration
    fees. Companies have tried to get out of these mass arbitrations through the court
    system. That has been unsuccessful."'

    to bring a small consumer claim that none get filed."'

    For example, you must first write Roku a letter and then meet with them in person
    or by video for a negotiation–with or without your lawyer.

- en: If you manage to sit through that, then arbitrations are limited to only 20
    claims, which means that most class-action lawyers won't bother. And these 20
    arbitrations must take place before 20 different arbitrators, says Siegel.

    get the result it wants, it kicks the claim back to the courts, where the court
    itself must first allow the court action.

    with the mass of arbitrations anyway. They get to use arbitration as a method
    of increasing costs of the claimants and abandon it when it would impose a cost
    on Roku," says Siegel.'

    of all the worst ways a company can weasel out of accountability, it's far from
    the only one. And chances are, you would not even know about it had you not read
    this article.

    for services like Roku. Courts view these services as optional and that consumers
    can opt-in or opt-out," attorney at law [Ed Hones](https://www.honeslaw.com/about/)
    told Lifewire via email. "Therefore, there is almost no limit on how onerous the
    terms of service can be."'

    in writing (yes, you have to mail them a paper letter) within 30 days. Even that
    is a major pain, requiring the names of all people opting out, their contact details,
    and more details, and a copy of your purchase receipt for hardware.

    Siegel recommends that we always look for the option to opt out and take it, but
    that means reading through pages and pages of legal spiel, which companies know
    we almost never do.

    prices, and designing their apps to make them [deliberately more annoying for
    users](https://www.lifewire.com/streaming-apps-love-to-work-against-you-5704928).
    And it's not just streaming apps. As more and more of our lives take place in
    cloud software and subscription-based apps, we have less and less control over
    the platforms we use and how they (mis)use and share our data.
