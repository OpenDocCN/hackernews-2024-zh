- en: Maxwell's Equations are a set of 4 complicated equations that describe the world
    of electromagnetics. These equations describe how electric and magnetic fields
    propagate, interact, and how they are influenced by objects.

- en: James Clerk Maxwell [1831-1879] was an Einstein/Newton-level genius who took
    a set of known experimental laws (Faraday's Law, Ampere's Law) and unified them
    into a symmetric coherent set of Equations known as Maxwell's Equations. Maxwell
    was one of the first to determine the speed of propagation of electromagnetic
    (EM) waves was the same as the speed of light - and hence to conclude that EM
    waves and visible light were really the same thing.

- en: Maxwell's Equations are critical in understanding [Antennas](http://www.antenna-theory.com)
    and Electromagnetics. They are formidable to look at - so complicated that most
    electrical engineers and physicists don't even really know what they mean. Shrouded
    in complex math (which is likely so "intellectual" people can feel superior in
    discussing them), true understanding of these equations is hard to come by.

- en: This leads to the reason for this website - an intuitive tutorial of Maxwell's
    Equations. I will avoid if at all possible the mathematical difficulties that
    arise, and instead describe what the equations mean. And don't be afraid - the
    math is so complicated that those who do understand complex vector calculus still
    cannot apply Maxwell's Equations in anything but the simplest scenarios. For this
    reason, intuitive knowledge of Maxwell's Equations is far superior than mathematical
    manipulation-based knowledge. To understand the world, you must understand what
    equations mean, and not just know mathematical constructs. I believe the accepted
    methods of teaching electromagnetics and Maxwell's Equations do not produce understanding.
    And with that, let's say something about these equations.

- en: Maxwell's Equations are laws - just like the law of gravity. These equations
    are rules the universe uses to govern the behavior of electric and magnetic fields.
    A flow of electric current will produce a magnetic field. If the current flow
    varies with time (as in any wave or periodic signal), the magnetic field will
    also give rise to an electric field. Maxwell's Equations shows that separated
    charge (positive and negative) gives rise to an electric field - and if this is
    varying in time as well will give rise to a propagating electric field, further
    giving rise to a propgating magnetic field.

    in Engineering or Physics, click through the links and definitions above. You'll
    find that the complicated math masks an inner elegance to these equations - and
    you'll learn how the universe operates the Electromagnetic Machine.
