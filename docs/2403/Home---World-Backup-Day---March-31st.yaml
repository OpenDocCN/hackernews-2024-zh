    data storage, instead of an external hard drive or USB stick. An external hard
    drive or USB stick can be lost or damaged. The biggest advantage of storing files
    in the cloud is that they are available anytime, anywhere. In terms of security,
    you should always pay close attention to access and security with cloud backups.

    disadvantage of an external hard drive is that the hard drive can break down or
    get lost. Physical external hard drives are often not handled with care or they
    are collecting dust for too long. The biggest advantage is that the storage space
    only needs to be purchased once. It is also a nice addition to a cloud or online
    backup. Don’t forget to update your physical hard drive every year.

    The speed difference between an SSD vs a hard drive is most apparent when copying
    and moving huge files. HDDs can copy 30 to 150 MB per second (MB/s), while standard
    SSDs perform the same action at speeds of 500 MB/s. (Source: Backblaze.com) Since

    could easily make multiple choices from the operating system on your computer.
    Now the PC operating systems are mainly promoting and integrating their own cloud
    services. However, there are still several options for making a backup. Before
    you go into business with a storage or backup service, you should only thoroughly
    familiarize yourself with the backup providers. This is partly due to the fact
    that you can no longer properly select these options from, for example, Windows
    itself.
