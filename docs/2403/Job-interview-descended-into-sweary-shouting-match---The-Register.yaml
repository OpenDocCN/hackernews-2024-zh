    who was a Linux expert, but somehow found himself working on a building site.

    technical hypothetical mail server issues.

- en: '"It came to a head, with both on their feet shouting at each other," Tim told
    On Call. "Colin insisted the failure was only possible if someone had altered
    the mail server''s source code."'

    issues discussed in his interview.

    of the software, and had assumed nobody would touch his code.

- en: Not long after "interviewing" Colin, the CTO checked the code – and found changes.
    Lots of changes. Bad changes that were the reason for the server's many problems.
