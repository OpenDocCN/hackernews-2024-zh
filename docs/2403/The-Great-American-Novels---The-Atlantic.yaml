- en: 'In 1868, a little-known writer by the name of John William DeForest proposed
    a new type of literature, a collective artistic project for a nation just emerging
    from an existential conflict: a work of fiction that accomplished “the task of
    painting the American soul.” It would be called the Great American Novel, and
    no one had written it yet, DeForest admitted. Maybe soon.'

- en: A century and a half later, the idea has endured, even as it has become more
    complicated. In 2024, our definition of literary greatness is wider, deeper, and
    weirder than DeForest likely could have imagined. At the same time, the novel
    is also under threat, as the forces of anti-intellectualism and authoritarianism
    seek to ban books and curtail freedom of expression. The American canon is more
    capacious, more fluid, and more fragile than perhaps ever before. But what, exactly,
    is in it? What follows is our attempt to discover just that.

- en: In setting out to identify that new American canon, we decided to define *American*
    as having first been published in the United States (or intended to be—read more
    in our entries on *Lolita* and *The Bell Jar*). And we narrowed our aperture to
    the past 100 years—a period that began as literary modernism was cresting and
    contains all manner of literary pleasure and possibility, including the experimentations
    of postmodernism and the narrative satisfactions of genre fiction.

    critics, and novelists, both at *The Atlantic* and outside it—and asked for their
    suggestions. From there, we added and subtracted and debated and negotiated and
    considered and reconsidered until we landed on the list you’re about to read.
    We didn’t limit ourselves to a round, arbitrary number; we wanted to recognize
    the very best—novels that say something intriguing about the world and do it distinctively,
    in intentional, artful prose—no matter how many or few that ended up being (136,
    as it turns out). Our goal was to single out those classics that stand the test
    of time, but also to make the case for the unexpected, the unfairly forgotten,
    and the recently published works that already feel indelible. We aimed for comprehensiveness,
    rigor, and open-mindedness. Serendipity, too: We hoped to replicate that particular
    joy of a friend pressing a book into your hand and saying, “You have to read this;
    you’ll love it.”'

    Fiction, and three children’s books. Twelve were published before the introduction
    of the mass-market paperback to America, and 24 after the release of the Kindle.
    At least 60 have been banned by schools or libraries. Together, they represent
    the best of what novels can do: challenge us, delight us, pull us in and then
    release us, a little smarter and a little more alive than we were before. You
    have to read them.'

  zh: 这份清单包括了45本处女作小说，九本普利策小说奖获得者，以及三本儿童书籍。在美国大众市场平装书推出之前出版的有十二本，在Kindle发布后出版的有24本。至少有60本曾被学校或图书馆禁止。它们共同代表了小说所能带来的最佳体验：挑战我们，使我们愉悦，吸引我们并让我们释放出来，比之前更聪明，更有活力。你一定要阅读它们。
