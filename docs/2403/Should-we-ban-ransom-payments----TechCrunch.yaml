    of a federal ban on ransom payments is getting louder.

- en: U.S. officials have long urged against paying ransom demands. But while several
    U.S. states — including North Carolina and Florida — have made it illegal for
    local government entities to pay ransom demands, the Biden administration as recently
    as last fall decided against an outright national ban on ransom payments.

    enforce and require complex mechanisms not yet in place, but critics argue that
    criminalizing payments to hackers ultimately punishes the victims of cybercrime
    who could ultimately face legal repercussions for doing what they deem necessary
    to protect — or, in some cases, save — their business.

- en: On the face of it, a ransom payment ban makes logical sense. If victim organizations
    are prohibited from paying, attackers will have less of a financial incentive
    to steal their data. In theory, this means those seeking to get rich quick will
    be forced to go elsewhere — and that ransomware attacks could become a thing of
    the past.

    For a ban on ransom payments to be successful, international and universal regulation
    would need to be implemented — which, given varying international standards around
    ransom payments, would be almost impossible to enforce. It would also require
    governments that grant safe harbor to cybercriminals — Russia gets an obvious
    namecheck — to crack down within their own borders, which they’re not incentivized
    to do.'

- en: Allan Liska, a ransomware expert and threat intelligence analyst at Recorded
    Future, told TechCrunch that before a blanket ban on payments to ransomware groups
    — or a ban with some exceptions — is enforced, we need to make a concerted effort
    to better catalog the number of ransomware attacks “so we can make an informed
    decision on the best steps.”

- en: “In the United States, we actually have two test cases that prove this point,”
    said Liska. “Both North Carolina and Florida have implemented bans on public entities
    paying ransom to ransomware groups. In both cases, looking at the data from a
    year before the laws went into effect and the year after, there has been no discernible
    change in the number of publicly reported ransomware attacks against public organizations
    in those States.”

    deterred by a ban on ransom payments. Rather, criminalizing payment would likely
    push it further underground and would likely encourage attackers to change tactics,
    becoming more covert in their operations and transactions.
