- en: A couple of months ago I read a few articles about developers turning off their
    syntax highlighting. At that time I had never questioned its utility. I decided
    to conduct a little experiment with me as the test subject.

- en: Initially, turning off syntax highlighting felt weird. I couldn’t skip through
    the source that fast anymore and it became harder to read. Even though this appeared
    to be an impairment I found it to be the strongest argument for making the switch.
    By forcing me to read the code more carefully, it made me understand it better.
    Another thing that I’ve noticed was that my coding style changed. I was structuring
    my source better; I was applying recurring visual patterns, writing less convoluted
    statements, and keeping my files short and concise. Instead of external stimuli
    (e.g. Linter, QA) forcing these practices upon me I was doing them naturally.

- en: The switch made me a big proponent of conditional highlighting. Unlike syntax
    highlighting, it emphasizes only the information that is relevant at a given time.
    For example a syntax checker that highlights your mistakes on every file save.
    Because the noise of the syntax highlighting was gone the conditional highlighting
    was even more visible, which made it an even more effective tool.

- en: 'As developers we have two objectives: Building software that works and writing
    code that others understand. Turning off syntax highlighting can make it easier
    to achieve the latter, but it doesn’t have to. You should decide for yourself
    if it belongs in your tool chain.'
