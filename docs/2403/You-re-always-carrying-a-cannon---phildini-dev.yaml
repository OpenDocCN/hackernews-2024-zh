    it won’t go off.

    you to go read it in its entirety one more time. No matter how friendly you are
    with your team, no matter your relationships outside work, no matter if you were
    one of the team yesterday and just got promoted, the cannon is always there and
    your reports can’t know with absolute certainty it won’t go off because they can’t
    see inside your brain.

    or bludgeon beyond recovery their career prospects on your team, at your company,
    and possibly beyond. The ultimate expression of the cannon is: you fire them.
    But short of firing them, there are dozens of big and small ways you could make
    their lives, inside and outside work, extremely difficult.'

    are aware of the cannon. Great managers are aware of the cannon and aware that
    their reports are aware of the cannon. Your reports, consciously or subconsciously,
    go into every meeting with you with some part of them knowing that this could
    be the meeting where you fire them, take away their projects, or in general make
    their lives miserable. They may not be able to voice this knowledge, you may have
    built trust such that they think the chances measure in the microscopic, but that
    doesn’t change the fact that the cannon is there and that how you behave as a
    manager influences the trust they have in the cannon not going off.

- en: 'This is part of the reason why trust building is so important: you need your
    team to believe that they will get lots and lots of warning before the cannon
    goes off. How you talk about projects, how you talk about performance, how you
    respond to suggestions, how you take feedback — all of these change the unconscious
    mental calculus in your reports’ heads about whether the cannon is going to go
    off for them.'

    but this is, for me, closer to a hard truth than a cloud with a silver lining.
    With great power comes great responsibility. If a silver lining exists, it’s that
    you have this power and can choose to wield it to make your team and your reports
    great, to use some of the cannon’s power to clear a path ahead of your team for
    the work they want to do, work that they will hopefully find fulfilling.

    know it, see it, and interact with their team to build trust around this fact.
