- en: We've hopped on past the golden age of TV, we're renting our music back from
    tech companies and social media is (with, perhaps, the exception of the first
    few years) on ever-flowing river of garbage. We have limitless options, such as
    they are. *Everyone* has a streaming service and *every* piece of intellectual
    property ever shall be converted into a franchise until the ROI on the most recent
    entry reaches zero.

    more and more content — quality be damned. [To facilitate this at scale, we've
    got AI](https://coryd.dev/posts/2024/i-dont-want-anything-your-ai-generates/).
    Streaming platforms are already paying small artists less, we're heading towards
    a future where they'll look to leverage AI generated content and pay *all* artists
    less (if at all). [We'll get junk content mined from legacy artists we hold close](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/18/opinion/private-equity-music-spotify.html).

    more options, more niche content and lowering barriers to entries to a new class
    of creatives. I'll concede that, in some cases, this may well be true. Perhaps
    drum machines improve, small barriers are lowered. My fear is that, in pursuit
    of scale, those minor and beneficial uses will be vastly outweighed by the quest
    for ever more scale.

    go on devaluing them. We'll lower barriers to entry for “creative” work but how
    creative is stitching something together with a few different models? It'll end
    up being less tooling, less signal and more noise.

    like I preferred the past model and, well, it too was deeply flawed in many respects.
    There is still compelling writing, art, movies and music being made and the tools
    used to do so will evolve. We're putting ever more weight on producing and creating
    *more* with little thought given to quality. It's easy to play on nostalgia and
    churn out ever more sludge. Who's excited for the next super hero movie? Want
    one about your favorite video game? How about 12?

    difficult. I have old movies to watch and a narrow set of new ones I'm interested
    in. The same is true of shows. There are more books than I can ever hope to read
    and I'm always careful to pick what I become invested in.

    the artists among that number that are no longer producing music, that's still
    a lot to follow. I take and explore recommendations sparingly.

    If you're no longer enjoying something, set it aside and move on. You're under
    no obligation to see it through and you're better served saving the time.
