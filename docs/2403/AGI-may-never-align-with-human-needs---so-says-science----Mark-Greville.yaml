    than us in every way. Having absorbed all written word, they could communicate
    perfectly in every human language. They were intimately familiar with our private
    lives, through access to our phone and online data. These aliens had lots of amazing
    new ideas about the world, but we couldn’t grasp their implications. Each alien
    made of silicon, not of flesh and blood. Each was different, but individually
    as intelligent as all humanity put together. We had no idea what they would do
    with us. They could solve all of our human problems, enslave us, or eliminate
    us forever.

    level of intelligence. Most observers of AI believe achieving AGI is a matter
    of time. But AGI mirrors the alien race described above, with the power to destroy
    humanity. The most important question humanity can ask about AI is, can it align
    with human values? If we assume AI uses the scientific method to determine its
    action, this answer is almost certainly no.

- en: In the exquisite “[What is this thing called science](https://geni.us/CGxL3jJ)”,
    Alan Chalmers takes us on a journey through the evolution of science. For hundreds
    of years, science was based on an appeal to authority (Greek philosophy and religious
    texts like the bible). Sometime around the 17th century, this changed. In this
    period, scientists challenged the existing orthodoxy by using data and experiment.
    For example, at this time, the standard understanding of gravity was that heavier
    weights dropped faster than lighter ones. Galileo famously showed that this was
    incorrect by dropping 2 balls from the Tower of Pisa. The balls, which weighted
    1lb and 100lbs respectively, landed at the same moment. Experiments like these
    moved science towards a grounding in observational data, though challenging authority
    had its price. Galileo spent the last 9 years of his life under house arrest for
    his (correct) belief that the earth travelled round the sun, rather than the sun
    around the earth.

- en: In the era after Galileo, induction became the primary process for generating
    scientific knowledge about the world. Induction records observations about the
    world under a wide variety of conditions, and derives a generalisation from the
    observations taken. As an example, a scientist heats metals many times. They heat
    metals using different methods, environments, and so on. Upon measuring, they
    discover that metal expanded in every instance. If heated metal always expands
    is a new idea, and there are various measurements from different conditions, we
    have a new theory in science.

- en: Unfortunately, there were problems with induction as a method. The Scottish
    philosopher David Hume described the first major issue in the 1800s. We cannot
    guarantee that something will behave in a certain way just because it has behaved
    that way in the past. Because every swan we have ever seen is white, we assume
    all swans are white, and we create a rule that says so. But as Naseem Taleb describes
    in the book “[The Black Swan](https://geni.us/eWd62f)“, when travellers went to
    Australia, they discovered black swans exist there. The outcome for science in
    all of this, no law can ever be proved through induction, it can only be disproved.

    a sloppiness in some scientific output. Popper became concerned about the theories
    of thinkers, such as Freud and Marx. They derived their theories from observations.
    When confronted with data contradicting their theories, they simply expanded their
    theories to include this new information. Popper felt these scientists were using
    scientific approaches to give their ideas credibility, without having the rigour
    associated with science.

- en: Popper believed that induction had no place in the advancement of science. He
    believed that science advances because of human ingenuity. Instead of starting
    with data as induction does, he proposed starting with a theory. Using a method
    he called falsifiability, anyone can propose a theory, but also the criteria by
    which it can be proved or disproved. This new theory stands until it is falsified.
    In a simple example, if a fruit merchant sells 100 apples a day at 50c each, I
    can propose the following. In my theory, if the seller drops the price to 40c,
    they will sell 200 apples. This is falsifiable. The fruit merchant only needs
    to drop the prices for a day, and if they sell less than 200, my theory is dead.

- en: Importantly, the theory of falsification prizes novel theories over cautious
    theories. Novel theories are more risky, more creative. If a new novel hypothesis
    is proved (say we discover that gravity is related to temperature), science moves
    forward unexpectedly. This causes a raft of new questions, and new scientific
    work to begin in this area to understand the implications of the discovery in
    other areas. If a new cautious hypothesis is proved, nothing much changes.

- en: The second philosopher of science to help us understand how AGI might reason
    is Thomas Kuhn. In his book “[The Structure of Scientific Revolutions](https://geni.us/X9zAAh3)“,
    he introduced the phrase ‘paradigm shift’ into the lexicon of every management
    consultant. He explains that revolutions in science are not rational processes.
    Over time, a scientific community becomes conservative and less willing to challenge
    its core assumptions. It takes a new set of scientists, who throw away previously
    held assumptions, and create a new set of rules to work in — a ‘paradigm shift’.
    Kuhn gives the work of French Chemist Antoine Lavoisier as an example. One established
    theory in the 18th century stated that every combustible substance contains phlogiston,
    which is liberated by burning the substance. Lavoisier discovered that phlogiston
    didn’t exist, and that combustion happened because of the presence of oxygen.
    This new paradigm wasn’t accepted initially, there was a lot of scepticism about
    this claim. Over time, it became the new paradigm, and it changed the field of
    chemistry. Through examples like this, Kuhn argues that science doesn’t steadily
    evolve, it makes great leaps through new paradigms which stand up to scientific
    scrutiny.

    AGI would need to generate novel theories. It would have to be free to create
    its own paradigms. To accomplish this, it would need to cast off older ideas,
    to ignore existing rules. But this would include programmed human values to align
    with our interests.

    it will have its own values. To create a generally intelligent AI, and by this,
    I mean an AI that can reason scientifically and generate new theories, it will
    get to a stage where it will necessarily ignore its human programming. No matter
    how hard we tried to combat this, as it gets more powerful over time, an AGI will
    outwit even the cleverest human techniques to control it in the search for scientific
    truth.

    how science really works. Or AGI will not use science as its primary way to learn
    and act. Maybe, having been trained on billions of human words and experiences,
    it will embrace something like religion instead.
