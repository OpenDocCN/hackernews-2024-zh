    part of a PostgreSQL database running on a single machine could as well be transformed
    into a distributed KV storage, leveraging the tremendous power of flexibility
    of AWS. Plain staging server running daily deployes from a ''develop'' branch
    could be ditched in favor of a production-only CI-enabled workflow with dynamic
    routing, allowing seamless A/B-testing and geo-dependency.'

    first place, and today, after weeks of downtime, it is virtually impossible to
    restore the meaning.
