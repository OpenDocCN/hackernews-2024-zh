- en: Xenobroom Inc., a young startup fresh out of Silicon Valley started a lengthy
    process of upgrading their server infrastructure back in May 2020\. According
    to the remaining fragments of CEO's daily journal and CTO's engineering notes,
    the company enjoyed a sharp rise in daily use in the midst of the global pandemic.
    Soon after, the decision to migrate the existing infrastructure to Kubernetes
    was made.

    to be revamped, re-considered and re-engineered. Many at the company thought it''s
    a good chance to upgrade software dependencies and libraries as well. A large
    part of a PostgreSQL database running on a single machine could as well be transformed
    into a distributed KV storage, leveraging the tremendous power of flexibility
    of AWS. Plain staging server running daily deployes from a ''develop'' branch
    could be ditched in favor of a production-only CI-enabled workflow with dynamic
    routing, allowing seamless A/B-testing and geo-dependency.'

    Both groups openly admit they could never quite understand the product in the
    first place, and today, after weeks of downtime, it is virtually impossible to
    restore the meaning.
