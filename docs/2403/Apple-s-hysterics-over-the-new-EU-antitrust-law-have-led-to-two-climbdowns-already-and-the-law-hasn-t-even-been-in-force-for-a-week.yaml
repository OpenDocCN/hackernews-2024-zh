- en: Apple’s hysterics over the new EU antitrust law have led to two climbdowns already—and
    the law hasn’t even been in force for a week

- en: The EU’s Digital Markets Act has been in place for less than five days, and
    its enforcers have already pushed Apple into two humiliating U-turns. If Apple
    has been trying to test how much it can throw its weight around in its increasingly
    hilarious hissy fit over [the new Big Tech antitrust law](https://fortune.com/2024/03/07/dma-digital-markets-act-europe-eu-big-tech-antitrust-law/),
    it’s had its answer now.

- en: The first reversal came earlier this month when Apple meekly agreed to let home-screen
    web apps continue functioning as intended on iPhones. It had previously killed
    off the entire category on the basis of protecting users’ security under a [rather
    odd reading](https://mashable.com/article/apple-kills-home-screen-web-apps-pwas-in-eu-dma)
    of the DMA. The Commission threatened an investigation, and Apple retreated.

    Epic Games, effectively allowing it to roll out a third-party iOS app store (an
    actual DMA demand) and also finally return *Fortnite* to iOS devices in the EU.

    was that Epic had previously violated Apple’s policy by launching an alternative
    to Apple’s payment system for in-app payments (which is why Apple banned *Fortnite*
    from the App Store in 2020). Apple had also argued that Epic’s criticism of Apple’s
    new EU business model meant it couldn’t be trusted to follow the terms for third-party
    app stores, even though Epic had promised to abide by them. Apple’s reasoning
    was doubly ludicrous because a) the Commission *wants* affected companies to give
    feedback on Big Tech’s attempts to comply with the DMA, and b) Apple claimed a
    California court ruling gave it the ability to cancel Epic’s developer accounts
    anytime it wanted, anywhere in the world.

- en: After the Commission again threatened an investigation—and presumably after
    Apple’s lawyers googled “jurisdiction”—the company again backed down. “I take
    note with satisfaction that following our contacts Apple decided to backtrack
    its decision on Epic exclusion,” cackled Commission digital chief Thierry Breton
    in an [X post](https://twitter.com/ThierryBreton/status/1766167580497117464).
    “From Day 2, [[the] DMA](https://twitter.com/hashtag/DMA?src=hashtag_click) is
    already showing very concrete results!”

    overreaching in its response to the DMA. But hey, nobody ever said compliance
    with EU tech law was easy.

- en: This morning, the European Data Protection Supervisor (EDPS)—the privacy regulator
    that specifically keeps an eye on big EU institutions—slammed the Commission for
    breaking a 2018 data-protection law in how its staff use Microsoft 365\. The watchdog
    said the Commission had failed to implement safeguards to ensure that people’s
    personal data is only being sent to countries whose data-protection rules are
    equivalent to the EU’s. What’s more, the Commission hadn’t been properly specifying
    what types of personal data would be collected in the use of Microsoft 365, and
    what the data would be used for, as the law demands. (This isn’t the well-known
    General Data Protection Regulation or GDPR, but rather a special companion law
    that only applies to the EU institutions.)

- en: As a result, the Commission will have to “suspend all data flows resulting from
    its use of Microsoft 365 to Microsoft and to its affiliates and sub-processors
    located in countries outside the [EU and European Economic Area]” that lack adequate
    privacy protections. It’s unclear which countries the watchdog means. The EDPS
    has given the Commission until early December to comply, reflecting how difficult
    it will be to comply with the decision without majorly disrupting the Commission’s
    work.

- en: The Commission insists that its use of Microsoft 365 is legally compliant; it’s
    studying the EDPS order before deciding how to respond. But, it said in a statement,
    “compliance with the EDPS decision unfortunately seems likely to undermine the
    current high level of mobile and integrated IT services. This applies not only
    to Microsoft but potentially also to other commercial IT services.”
