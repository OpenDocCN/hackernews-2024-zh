    – and getting it accepted had so far been an untold story of strategy and ingenuity.
    The eBPF documentary, published late last year, tells this story by interviewing
    key players from 2014 including myself, and touches on new developments including
    Windows. (If you are new to eBPF, it is the name of a kernel execution engine
    that runs a variety of new programs in a performant and safe sandbox in the kernel,
    like how JavaScript can run programs safely in a browser sandbox; it is also no
    longer an acronym.) The documentary was played at KubeCon and is on [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wb_vD3XZYOA):'

    voices discussing the problems we were trying to fix. Thanks to Speakeasy Productions
    for doing such a great job with this [documentary](https://ebpfdocumentary.com/),
    and letting you experience what it was like in those early days. This is also
    a great example of all the work that goes on behind the scenes to get code merged
    in a large codebase like Linux.

    and Amer Ather, we were so entranced that we lost track of time and were eventually
    kicked out of the meeting room as another meeting was starting. It was then I
    realized that we had missed lunch! Alexei sounded so confident that I was convinced
    that eBPF was the future, but a couple of times he added "if the patches get merged."
    *If* they get merged?? They *have* to get merged, this idea is too good to waste.

    and there are now hundreds contributing to make it what it is. A longer documentary
    could also interview Brendan Blanco (bcc), Yonghong Song (bcc), Sasha Goldshtein
    (bcc), Alastair Robertson (bpftrace), Tobais Waldekranz (ply), Andrii Nakryiko,
    Joe Stringer, Jakub Kicinski, Martin KaFai Lau, John Fastabend, Quentin Monnet,
    Jesper Dangaard Brouer, Andrey Ignatov, Stanislav Fomichev, Teng Qin, Paul Chaignon,
    Vicent Marti, Dan Xu, Bas Smit, Viktor Malik, Mary Marchini, and many more. Thanks
    to everyone for all the work.

    time to get involved: It''s likely already available in your production kernels,
    and there are tools, libraries, and documentation to help you get started.'

    eBPF startup, as Cisco recently announced they would acquire them!
