- en: Airbnb will no longer allow hosts to use indoor security cameras, regardless
    of where they’re placed or what they’re used for. In [an update on Monday](https://news.airbnb.com/an-update-on-our-policy-on-security-cameras/),
    Airbnb says the change to “prioritize the privacy” of renters goes into effect
    on April 30th.

    hosts install security cameras in “common areas” of listings, including hallways,
    living rooms, and front doors. Airbnb required hosts to disclose the presence
    of security cameras in their listings and make them clearly visible, and it prohibited
    hosts from using cameras in bedrooms and bathrooms.

    as an outdoor shower or sauna.'

- en: Airbnb hosts will have until the end of April to remove the security cameras
    from inside their listings. If a guest reports the presence of an indoor camera
    after that, Airbnb says it will investigate and that it could remove the host’s
    listing or account as a result. The new policy still can’t control the presence
    of hidden cameras, but it will at least offer some peace of mind knowing that
    rule-abiding hosts can no longer put cameras anywhere in their rentals.
