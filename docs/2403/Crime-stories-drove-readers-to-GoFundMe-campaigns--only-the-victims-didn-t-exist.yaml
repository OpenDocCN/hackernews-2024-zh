    local news from across the country. In a series of articles, the author reported
    on a hit-and-run accident that had left two people dead: Herman Cruz and his 4-year-old
    daughter, Amelia. Herman had been driving Amelia to her cancer treatments in Richmond,
    Virginia, when they were killed, the author claimed.'

    to raise money to pay for their funeral services. “All donations will help and
    be appreciated,” said the GoFundMe organizer, identified as Jamel El-Amin. The
    campaign raised more than $1,500.

    identified himself as “Jamel” in an author bio appears to have fabricated the
    story. In emails this week, Virginia authorities — state and local police, a commonwealth’s
    attorney — told NBC News they had no record of the victims, no reports of the
    hit-and-run.

    several weeks. In each case, the articles included links to GoFundMe pages where
    readers — moved by details of grim crimes and terrible accidents — could open
    up their virtual pocketbooks. Three of the campaigns seen by NBC News raised a
    total of nearly $2,700.
