    local news from across the country. In a series of articles, the author reported
    on a hit-and-run accident that had left two people dead: Herman Cruz and his 4-year-old
    daughter, Amelia. Herman had been driving Amelia to her cancer treatments in Richmond,
    Virginia, when they were killed, the author claimed.'

    to raise money to pay for their funeral services. “All donations will help and
