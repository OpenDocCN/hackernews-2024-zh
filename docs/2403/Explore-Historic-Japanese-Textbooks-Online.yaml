    and written in. Their computer-printed images were certainly not fine art, especially
    with other students' layering doodles over the years. However, textbooks do not
    always have to be boring; they can be works of art. An online archive of historic
    Japanese textbooks from the 19th and 20th centuries—hosted by the [National Institute
    for Educational Policy Research](https://www.nier.go.jp/library/rarebooks/)—exemplifies
    the textbook as an art form. Decorated in everything from hand painting and calligraphy
    to traditional block printing, the books are explorable in PDF format for free.

    and brushwork guides for calligraphy. These works span a broad period, from the
    19th century till after World War II—a time of immense change for Japan. Some
    texts are many pages long, combining elegant writing with detailed illustrations.
    Horses dance across a page beneath simple characters; whereas in another book,
    plants found in the garden are illustrated. Others depict teachers and small pupils
    cross-legged in front of their lecturers. It's fascinating even for those who
    cannot read Japanese.

    is an ancient art, dating back to the 8th century in Japan. These abilities to
    create books long pre-dated the European [invention of the printing press](https://mymodernmet.com/history-of-the-printing-press/)
    during the Renaissance. Sometimes a block print might create the lines of a drawing,
    which was then colored in by hand. Other times, artists utilized the “brocade”
    method, *nishiki-e*, of using multiple blocks in multiple inks to create an image.
    It was not until the 20th century that modern print technology began to replace
    these methods. While modern textbooks might be more conducive to mass production
    or regular updating, they surely cannot match the charm, elegance, and beauty
    of these historic tomes.
