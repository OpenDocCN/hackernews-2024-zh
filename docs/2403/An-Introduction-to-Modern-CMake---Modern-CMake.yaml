    examples of developers making the state of build systems the brunt of jokes. This
    raises the question: Why? Certainly there are no shortage of problems when building.
    But I think that, in 2023, we have a very good solution to quite a few of those
    problems. It''s CMake. Not CMake 2.8 though; that was released before C++11 even
    existed! Nor the horrible examples out there for CMake (even those posted on KitWare''s
    own tutorials list). I''m talking about Modern CMake. CMake 3.5+, maybe even CMake
    3.29+! It''s clean, powerful, and elegant, so you can spend most of your time
    coding, not adding lines to an unreadable, unmaintainable Make (Or CMake 2) file.
    And CMake 3.11+ is supposed to be significantly faster, as well!'

- en: 'Build systems are a hot topic. Of course there are many options. But even a
    really good one, or one that re-uses a familiar syntax, can''t come close to CMake.
    Why? Support. Every IDE supports CMake (or CMake supports that IDE). More packages
    use CMake than any other system. So, if you use a library that is designed to
    be included in your code, you have a choice: Make your own build system, or use
    one of the provided ones, and that will almost always include CMake. And that
    will quickly be the common denominator if you include multiple projects. And,
    if you need a library that''s preinstalled, the chances of it having a find CMake
    script or config CMake script are excellent.'

- en: I believe that CMake 3 had the bad luck to follow Python 3.^([1](#fn_1)) Even
    though every version of CMake is insanely backward compatible, the 3 series was
    treated as if it were something new. And so, you'll find OSs like CentOS7 with
    GCC 4.8, with almost-complete C++14 support, and CMake 2.8, which came out years
    before C++11.

- en: You really should *at least* use a version of CMake that came out after your
    compiler, since it needs to know compiler flags, etc, for that version. And, since
    CMake will dumb itself down to the minimum required version in your CMake file,
    installing a new CMake, even system wide, is pretty safe. You should *at least*
    install it locally. It's easy (1-2 lines in many cases), and you'll find that
    5 minutes of work will save you hundreds of lines and hours of `CMakeLists.txt`
    writing, and will be much easier to maintain in the long run.

- en: ¹. CMake 3.0 also removed several long deprecated features from very old versions
    of CMake and make one very tiny backwards incompatible change to syntax related
    to square brackets, so this is not entirely fair; there might be some very, very
    old CMake files that would stop working with 3\. I've never seen one, though.
