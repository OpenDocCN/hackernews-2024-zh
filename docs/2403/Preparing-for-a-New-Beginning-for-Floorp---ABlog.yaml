    have noticed, Floorp has recently gone closed-source.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A year ago, when we announced Floorp 11, Floorp was a browser for which no fork
    yet existed.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Recently, however, there have been various forks of Floorp. I admit that collaboration
    on open source projects is great, but I have a strong sense of urgency about this.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I know it’s not nice of me to say, but Floorp has been in too much demand. It
    am surprise to me that companies and organizations would fork a fork that I had
    created when I was still a teenager, and at first I was happy about it, but it
    was not beneficial to me, and on the contrary, it was mentally draining.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There were forks that wanted to hide the fact that they were Floorp forks, forks
    that did not want to contribute to Floorp at all, forks that used the code for
    life and just changed the name of Floorp, and many other forks were born.

- en: There are only a handful of people in this world who know anything about Firefox,
    and since Floorp currently has no advertising, my own salary is, of course, zero.
    It’s just not going to last.

- en: I am not concerned about name recognition. In order to keep Floorp sustainable,
    we also need the maintainers of the forks to cooperate.

    and if Floorp goes down, of course Floorp fork goes down too. This is the not
    good way.'

    a note, I allow the use of the code if the fork is not malicious. In fact, I allowed
    FireDragon to use the code for free.
