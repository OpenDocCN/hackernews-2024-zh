- en: I know it’s not nice of me to say, but Floorp has been in too much demand. It
    am surprise to me that companies and organizations would fork a fork that I had
    created when I was still a teenager, and at first I was happy about it, but it
    was not beneficial to me, and on the contrary, it was mentally draining.

    that did not want to contribute to Floorp at all, forks that used the code for
    life and just changed the name of Floorp, and many other forks were born.

    It’s just not going to last.

    we also need the maintainers of the forks to cooperate.
