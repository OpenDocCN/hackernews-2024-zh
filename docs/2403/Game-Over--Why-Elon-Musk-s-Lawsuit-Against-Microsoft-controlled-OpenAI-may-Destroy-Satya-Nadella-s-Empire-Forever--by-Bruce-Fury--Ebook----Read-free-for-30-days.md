### INTRODUCTION

As we discussed in our popular book, *Microsoft's Art of Stock Price Manipulation and How to Protect Yourself*, the world’s largest company is actually the world’s largest **holding** company. That is the big transformation under present Chairman and CEO Satya Nadella.

Satya Nadella who has gutted out the entire company and deprioritized the company’s crown jewels which give it recall value has also lost good talent by creating a dangerously toxic environment filled with professionally less capable yes men and women throughout the company.

Nadella who was search of a glue that will prevent the company from going in a hundred different directions for each division felt that well known AI non-profit OpenAI is that glue. Hence, he made OpenAI’s technology central to each and every Microsoft product under the brand name Copilot. To achieve this, he made the non-profit discard its founding principles of being Open (as in open sourcing everything they create) and work for better of humanity and move to being Closed (where company does not share its program code and logic with the world) and works exclusively for further enrichment of the world’s largest company – Microsoft.

Elon Musk, one of the founding fathers and funders of OpenAI, has filed a lawsuit which threatens to expose Nadella and OpenAI’s controversial agreements and accounts for the world to see and force OpenAI back to honouring the founding agreement upon which it was created.

This lawsuit explains why Nadella’s Microsoft recently announced a partnership with French AI Company, Mistral – because OpenAI is about to be put in the dock and under the magnifying glass slowing down the company’s progress -, and why Musk was poking around with Windows 11 in the weeks prior to the lawsuit – he wanted to see Windows Copilot in action to bolster his claims in the lawsuit. Once this happens, the glue that OpenAI’s Copilot was supposed to be evaporates. Nadella’s Microsoft should reset back to its rightful valuation which as we have said – is just a fraction of what it current is.

The lawsuit makes for some very interesting reading and is very, very simple in its usage of language. Clearly, Elon Musk wanted everybody to read and understand the lawsuit and its contents, considering that the technology under question – Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) - affects the entire of humanity.

### PARTIES TO THE LAWSUIT

Musk makes very interesting comments about the OpenAI’s board and its new composition after Sam Altman was fired and then rehired primarily under the pressure of Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella.

Here’s the lawsuit under question and our commentary:

**SUPERIOR COURT OF CALIFORNIA IN AND FOR THE COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO**

*The lawsuit is filed in California and Musk clearly states in the lawsuit that all the events relevant to the case happened in the state of California and more precisely in the county of San Francisco.*

**ELON MUSK, an individual,** Plaintiff,

*Musk files this in his individual capacity as he has contributed his personal funds for OpenAI, used his personal time for OpenAI and spent his personal time for OpenAI discussions.*

vs.

**SAMUEL ALTMAN, an individual, GREGORY BROCKMAN, an individual,**

**OPENAI, INC., a corporation, OPENAI, L.P., a limited partnership, OPENAI, L.L.C., a limited liability company, OPENAI GP, L.L.C., a limited liability company, OPENAI OPCO, LLC, a limited liability company, OPENAI GLOBAL, LLC, a limited liability company, OAI CORPORATION, LLC, a limited liability company, OPENAI HOLDINGS, LLC, a limited liability company,** and DOES 1 through 100, inclusive, Defendants.

*The number of companies created to hide OpenAI’s unethical law-breaking actions. The lengths that Microsoft’s lawyers have made OpenAI to go through to hide true ownership and intentions of what they are working on are truly mind boggling.*

*Because the structure of OpenAI is opaque and hidden from public, Musk says many other unknown individuals and entities could be involved in the criminal actions. It is possible that Doe (as in Jane Doe, which refers to unknown or unnamed person) may expand to include Kevin Scott, Microsoft CTO and Ex-LinkedIn CTO who was instrumental in making the deal happen,*
