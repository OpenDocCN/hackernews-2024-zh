# Welcome to Linux From Scratch!

Linux From Scratch (LFS) is a project that provides you with step-by-step instructions for building your own custom Linux system, entirely from source code.

Currently, the Linux From Scratch organization consists of the following subprojects:

*   [LFS](lfs/) :: Linux From Scratch is the main book, the base from which all other projects are derived.
*   [BLFS](blfs/) :: Beyond Linux From Scratch helps you extend your finished LFS installation into a more customized and usable system.
*   [ALFS](alfs/) :: Automated Linux From Scratch provides tools for automating and managing LFS and BLFS builds.
*   [Hints](hints/) :: The Hints project is a collection of documents that explain how to enhance your LFS system in ways that are not included in the LFS or BLFS books.
*   [Patches](patches/) :: The Patches project serves as a central repository for all patches useful to an LFS user.
*   [LFS Editor's Guide](lfs/LFS-EDITORS-GUIDE.html) :: A document that describes the LFS development process.
*   [Museum](museum/) :: Copies of ancient LFS and BLFS versions.
