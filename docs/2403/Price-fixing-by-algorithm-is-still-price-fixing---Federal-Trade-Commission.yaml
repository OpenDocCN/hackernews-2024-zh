    technology to do it doesn’t change that antitrust fundamental. Regardless of the
    industry you’re in, if your business uses an algorithm to determine prices, a
    brief filed by the FTC and the Department of Justice offers a helpful guideline
    for antitrust compliance: your algorithm can’t do anything that would be illegal
    if done by a real person.'

    in the residential housing market. The agencies filed a [joint legal brief](https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/ftc_gov/pdf/YardiSOI-filed%28withattachments%29_0.pdf)
    explaining that price fixing through an algorithm is still price fixing. The brief
    highlights key aspects of competition law important for businesses in every industry:
    (1) you can’t use an algorithm to evade the law banning price-fixing agreements,
    and (2) an agreement to use shared pricing recommendations, lists, calculations,
    or algorithms can still be unlawful even where co-conspirators retain some pricing
    discretion or cheat on the agreement.'

    housing rental prices. [Rent is up](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CUUR0000SEHA)
    nearly 20% since 2020, with the largest increases [concentrated](https://www.jchs.harvard.edu/sites/default/files/reports/files/Harvard_JCHS_Americas_Rental_Housing_2024.pdf)

    with landlords reportedly using software like “RENTMaximizer” and similar products
    to determine rents for [tens of millions](https://www.propublica.org/article/yieldstar-rent-increase-realpage-rent)
    of apartments across the country. Efforts to fight collusion are even more critical
    given [private equity-backed consolidation](https://www.propublica.org/article/when-private-equity-becomes-your-landlord)
    among landlords and property management companies. The considerable leverage these
    firms already have over their renters is only exacerbated by potential algorithmic
    price collusion. Algorithms that recommend prices to numerous competing landlords
    threaten to remove renters’ ability to vote with their feet and comparison-shop
    for the best apartment deal around.

- en: '**Agreeing to use an algorithm is an agreement**. In algorithmic collusion,
    a pricing algorithm combines competitor data and spits out the suggested “maximized”
    rent for a unit given local conditions. Such software can allow landlords to collude
    on pricing by using an algorithm—something the law doesn’t allow IRL. When you
    replace once-independent pricing decisions with a shared algorithm, expect trouble.
    Competitors using a shared human agent to fix prices? Illegal. Doing the same
    thing but with an agreed upon, shared algorithm? Still illegal. It’s also irrelevant
    that the algorithm maker isn’t a direct competitor if you and your competitors
    each agree to use their product knowing the others are doing the same in concert.'

    require perfection, but price-fixing arrangements aren’t one of them. Just because
    a software recommends rather than determines a price doesn’t mean it’s legal.
    Setting initial starting prices or recommending initial starting prices can be
    illegal, even if conspirators deviate from recommended prices. And even if some
    of the conspirators cheat by starting with lower prices than those the algorithm
    recommended, that doesn’t necessarily change things. Being bad at breaking the
    law isn’t a defense.'

    and more efficient. But its efficiency can also be used by bad actors to crush
    competition or bilk consumers in novel ways. No matter the tool law violators
    use, the FTC and the Department of Justice stand vigilant on the side of consumers
    and competition.
