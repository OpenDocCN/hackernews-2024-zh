- en: In 2016, Facebook launched a secret project designed to intercept and decrypt
    the network traffic between people using Snapchat’s app and its servers. The goal
    was to understand users’ behavior and help Facebook compete with Snapchat, according
    to newly unsealed court documents. Facebook called this “Project Ghostbusters,”
    in a clear reference to Snapchat’s ghost-like logo.

    as part of the class action lawsuit between consumers and Meta, Facebook’s parent
    company.

- en: The newly released documents reveal how Meta tried to gain a competitive advantage
    over its competitors, including Snapchat and later Amazon and YouTube, by analyzing
    the network traffic of how its users were interacting with Meta’s competitors.
    Given these apps’ use of encryption, Facebook needed to develop special technology
    to get around it.

    decrypting” encrypted app traffic from users of Snapchat, and later from users
    of YouTube and Amazon, the consumers’ lawyers wrote in the document.'

    because their traffic is encrypted we have no analytics about them,” Meta chief
    executive Mark Zuckerberg wrote in an email dated June 9, 2016, which was published
    as part of the lawsuit. “Given how quickly they’re growing, it seems important
    to figure out a new way to get reliable analytics about them. Perhaps we need
    to do panels or write custom software. You should figure out how to do this.”

    proposed a solution: so-called kits that can be installed on iOS and Android that
    intercept traffic for specific subdomains, “allowing us to read what would otherwise
    be encrypted traffic so we can measure in-app usage,” read an email from July
    2016\. “This is a ‘man-in-the-middle’ approach.”'

- en: A man-in-the-middle attack — nowadays also called adversary-in-the-middle —
    is an attack where hackers intercept internet traffic flowing from one device
    to another over a network. When the network traffic is unencrypted, this type
    of attack allows the hackers to read the data inside, such as usernames, passwords,
    and other in-app activity.

    network analysis technique was not going to be effective. This is why Facebook
    engineers proposed using Onavo, which when activated had the advantage of reading
    all of the device’s network traffic before it got encrypted and sent over the
    internet.
