    Altman's [ambitious plan](https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/artificial-intelligence/openais-sam-altman-raises-billions-to-build-chip-empire-report)
    to build excessive semiconductor manufacturing capacity for AI processors, reports the
    [Financial Times](https://www.ft.com/content/d018067f-20e7-49eb-83dc-ebb8b1aad1a5?s=31).
    If the talks succeed, the move will be in line with the United Arab Emirates'
    strategy to become a key player in the global artificial intelligence industry.

    push to develop its semiconductors is driven by the need to reduce dependency
    on Nvidia''s AI GPUs, such as the [H100](https://www.tomshardware.com/news/nvidia-hopper-h100-80gb-price-revealed).
    Meanwhile, besides developing AI processors, [Sam Altman](https://www.tomshardware.com/news/openai-ousts-ceo-sam-altmanhttps://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/artificial-intelligence/jim-keller-responds-to-sam-altmans-plan-to-raise-dollar7-billion-to-make-ai-chips)

    and potentially other companies. After witnessing two major semiconductor supply
    crises in recent years (first for the automotive and PC industries and then for
    the AI industry), he seems to believe that traditional contract makers of chips
    do not have sufficient manufacturing capacities to fulfill the global demand for
    AI chips. As a result, he allegedly wants more fabs to be built.'

    new semiconductor manufacturing facilities and supporting infrastructure [could
    reach up to $7 trillion](https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/artificial-intelligence/openai-ceo-sam-altman-seeks-dollar5-to-dollar7-trillion-to-build-a-network-of-fabs-for-ai-chips).
    While it is still unclear whether the chip venture is an OpenAI project or Sam
    Altman's project (most likely the latter), the CEO has been touring around the
    world [talking to chipmakers](https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/artificial-intelligence/openais-sam-altman-discusses-chip-collab-with-samsung-and-sk-hynix-report) and
    seeking support from nation-states, including discussions with Singapore's Temasek,
    as traditional venture capitalists are unlikely to invest such vast sums.

    Zayed al-Nahyan, the national security adviser. The fund aims to make Abu Dhabi
    a central hub for AI development, leveraging the country's financial resources
    and political backing. The UAE's ambition to become a global AI powerhouse is
    evident in its efforts to attract leading figures in the AI industry, including
    Elon Musk, who has expressed interest in partnering with the Gulf state for his
    AI venture, xAI.

    holding from the UAE, backed by Abu Dhabi's sovereign investment fund Mubadala.
    G42 has established partnerships with major players in the AI industry, including
    OpenAI, [Microsoft](https://www.tomshardware.com/tag/microsoft), and [Cerebras](https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/artificial-intelligence/cerebras-launches-900000-core-125-petaflops-wafer-scale-processor-for-ai-theoretically-equivalent-to-about-62-nvidia-h100-gpus).

    world's first AI minister in 2017 and opening an AI-focused graduate university

    such as the U.S.-China trade tensions that extend well beyond trade to national
    security grounds. G42 has had to reassess its partnerships with Chinese companies,
