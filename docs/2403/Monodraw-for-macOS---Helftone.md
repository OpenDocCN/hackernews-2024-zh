# Monodraw for macOS — Helftone

> 来源：[https://monodraw.helftone.com/](https://monodraw.helftone.com/)

**What are the system requirements?**

The app requires macOS 11 Big Sur or later.

If you're running an older version of macOS, you can download [Monodraw v1.3](https://updates.helftone.com/monodraw/downloads/Monodraw-b102.dmg) which requires macOS 10.10 Yosemite or [Monodraw v1.5](https://updates.helftone.com/monodraw/downloads/Monodraw-b107.dmg) which requires macOS 10.14 Mojave.

**Which versions include the command line tool?**

Only the versions which you download directly from our website and purchase from [our store](https://sites.fastspring.com/helftone/product/monodraw). Due to restrictions imposed by the [App Sandbox](https://developer.apple.com/app-sandboxing/) on the Mac App Store, the tool cannot be included there.
