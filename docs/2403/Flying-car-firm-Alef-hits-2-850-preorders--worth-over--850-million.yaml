- en: BARCELONA, Spain — Alef Aeronautics, a flying car firm backed by high-profile
    venture capitalist Tim Draper, says it has reached 2,850 preorders for its futuristic
    electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) vehicle.

    recently hit a fresh record after previously [reporting 2,500 preorders](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/alef-reports-pre-orders-of-750m-worth-of-flying-cars-301884085.html)
    for its two-seater flying car, the Alef Model A.

    have to put down a $150 deposit for the vehicle. Customers can pull the deposit
    at any time if they want to, so they're not locked in.

- en: Alef is planning to charge customers $300,000 for the Model A when it becomes
    commercially available — so on 2,850 preorders, that would give it a combined
    order value of more than $850 million to date.

    which makes it the bestselling aircraft in history, more than Boeing, Airbus,
    Joby Aviation and most of the eVTOLs [electric vertical takeoff and landing vehicles]
    combined," Alef''s CEO, Jim Dukhovny, told CNBC.'

- en: At a price of $300,000, Alef is asking its prospective customers to part with
    a lot of cash. Dukhovny insists the higher price tag is needed as Alef is still
    a startup and isn't making any serious money yet.

    it plans to launch a flying taxi service in partnership with Joby Aviation in

    a jet and come with wings attached to the sides, or big helicopter-like rotors.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: What Alef is going for is a much more different style of vehicle. The company's
    Model A car, which it showed off at the Mobile World Congress as a half-size model,
    resembles an actual car with a mesh shell protecting rotors on the inside that
    allow air to flow through the vehicle.

- en: Dukhovny calls Alef's vehicle the "first flying car in history." He says it's
    the first because, rather than the massive drone-like designs we've seen in vehicles
    from the likes of Lilium and Joby Aviation, Alef's looks like an actual car.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '"I know that people have claimed the first flying car," Dukhovny said. "But
    we always had the idea that it has to be a car, a physical car, a regular car,
    as you can see it''s an eVTOL, an electric car. a regular car, drive, park, look,
    everything as a car, and a vertical takeoff."'

    take to the skies, too.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To drive on the road, the car uses four small engines in each of the wheels,
    and will drive similar to a normal electric car. It has eight propellers in the
    front and back of the car, which spin independently at different speeds to allow
    it to fly in any direction.

- en: The Alef Model A has a cruise speed of 110 mph while in the air, while on the
    road it is limited to between 25 and 35 mph.

- en: Once it lifts off, the Alef Model A can then turn onto its side while the cockpit
    swivels so that the driver can continue facing forward and the car practically
    becomes a biplane with the long sides of the vehicles serving as the top and bottom
    "wings."

    meaning it comes under the same legal classification as small electric vehicles
