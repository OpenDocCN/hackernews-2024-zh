    recently hit a fresh record after previously [reporting 2,500 preorders](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/alef-reports-pre-orders-of-750m-worth-of-flying-cars-301884085.html)

    have to put down a $150 deposit for the vehicle. Customers can pull the deposit

    commercially available — so on 2,850 preorders, that would give it a combined
    order value of more than $850 million to date.

    which makes it the bestselling aircraft in history, more than Boeing, Airbus,

    combined," Alef''s CEO, Jim Dukhovny, told CNBC.'

    a lot of cash. Dukhovny insists the higher price tag is needed as Alef is still
    a startup and isn't making any serious money yet.

    Model A car, which it showed off at the Mobile World Congress as a half-size model,
    resembles an actual car with a mesh shell protecting rotors on the inside that
    allow air to flow through the vehicle.

    the first because, rather than the massive drone-like designs we've seen in vehicles
    from the likes of Lilium and Joby Aviation, Alef's looks like an actual car.

    we always had the idea that it has to be a car, a physical car, a regular car,
    as you can see it''s an eVTOL, an electric car. a regular car, drive, park, look,
    everything as a car, and a vertical takeoff."'

    and will drive similar to a normal electric car. It has eight propellers in the
    front and back of the car, which spin independently at different speeds to allow
    it to fly in any direction.

    swivels so that the driver can continue facing forward and the car practically
    becomes a biplane with the long sides of the vehicles serving as the top and bottom
    "wings."
