- en: The JSON Canvas format was created to provide longevity, readability, interoperability,
    and extensibility to data created with infinite canvas apps. The format is designed
    to be easy to parse and give users [ownership over their data](https://stephango.com/file-over-app).
    JSON Canvas files use the `.canvas` extension.

    JSON Canvas can be implemented freely as an import, export, and storage format
    for any [app or tool](/docs/apps/). This site, and all the resources associated
