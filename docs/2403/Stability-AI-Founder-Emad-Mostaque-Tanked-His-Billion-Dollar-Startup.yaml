    additional funding. It had defaulted on payments to Amazon whose cloud service
    undergirded Stability’s core offerings. The star research team behind its flagship
    text-to-image generator Stable Diffusion had tendered their resignations just
    three days before — [as *Forbes* would first report](https://www.forbes.com/sites/iainmartin/2024/03/20/key-stable-diffusion-researchers-leave-stability-ai-as-company-flounders/

    Stable Diffusion image generator released earlier this month could generate “200
    cats with hats per second.” But later, when he was asked about Stability’s financial
    model, Mostaque fumbled. “I can’t say that publicly,” he replied. “But it’s going

    which was angling for a contract it hoped would generate several millions in annual
    revenue. But the deal never materialized, four sources said.

    models that would invigorate their economies and citizenry. “Emad envisions a
    world where AI through 100 national models serves not as a tool of the few, but
    as a benefactor to all promising to confront great adversaries, cancer, autism,
    and the sands of time itself,” the AI avatar of Aristotle said in his intro at
    the conference.

    within 60 days — an untenable timeline, according to two people in position to
    know. Stability attempted to develop a model for the Singaporean government over
    the protestation of employees who questioned its technical feasibility, three
    sources familiar with the effort told *Forbes*. But it couldn’t pull it off and
    Singapore never became a customer. (The government of Singapore confirmed it did
    not enter into a deal with Stability, but declined to answer additional questions.)

    development and other elements. There are far better people than me to do that.”'

    of revenue: reselling the compute it was leasing from providers like AWS, according
    to six people familiar with the effort. Though it was essentially GPU arbitrage,
    Stability framed the strategy to investors as a “managed services” offering. Its
    damning October financial report projected optimistically that such an offering
    would bring in $139 million in 2024 — 98% of its revenue. Multiple employees at
    the time told *Forbes* they feared reselling compute, even if the company called
    it “managed services,” would violate the terms of Stability’s contract with AWS.
    Amazon declined to comment. “The line internally was that we are not reselling
    compute,” one former employee said. “This was some of the dirtiest feeling stuff.”'

    one of these people told *Forbes*. Andreessen Horowitz and CoreWeave declined

    now that Mostaque is out of the picture. Regardless, interim co-CEOs Wong and
    Laforte are on a tight timeline to clean up his mess. Board chairman Jim O’Shaughnessy
    said in a statement that he was confident the pair “will adeptly steer the company
    forward in developing and commercializing industry-leading generative AI products.”
    But burn continues to far outpace revenue. The *Financial Times* [reported](https://www.ft.com/content/d7bbb769-20f1-4242-bd15-201741c90720
    "https://www.ft.com/content/d7bbb769-20f1-4242-bd15-201741c90720") Friday that
    the company made $5.4 million of revenue in February, against $8 million in costs.
    Several sources said there are ongoing concerns about making payroll for the roughly
    150 remaining employees. Leadership roles have gone vacant for months amid the
    disarray, leaving the company increasingly directionless.

    the AI models powering Stable Diffusion. A London-based court has already rejected
    the company’s bid to throw out one of the lawsuits on the basis that none of its
    researchers were based in the U.K. And Stability’s claim that Getty’s Delaware

    a law professor at Santa Clara University. He told *Forbes* that though plaintiffs
    suing AI firms face an uphill battle overcoming the existing legal precedent on
    copyright infringement, the quantity of arguments available to make are virtually
    inexhaustible. “Like in military theory, if there’s a gap in your lines, that’s
    where the enemy pours through — if any one of those arguments succeeds, it could
    completely change the generative AI environment,” he said. “In some sense, generative
    AI as an industry has to win everything.”
