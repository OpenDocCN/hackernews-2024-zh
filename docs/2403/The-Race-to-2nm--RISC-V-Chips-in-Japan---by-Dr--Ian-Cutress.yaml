- en: One of the sidelines in the semiconductor industry that’s flying under the radar
    a bit is the rise of Rapidus. Rapidus is a new semiconductor company, established
    in August 2022 in Japan, with the plan to bring latest generation semiconductor
    manufacturing into the country. Rapidus is backed by eight major companies from
    Japan, including Denso, Kioxia, NTT, NEC, Softbank, Sony, and Toyota, with the
    goal of bringing 2nm manufacturing capacity online in 2027\. This has led to deep
    collaborations with the Japanese government (330 billion yen of subsidies) and
    the US government for design and collaboration. In part, Rapidus has created partnerships
    with IBM for its Gate-All-Around transistor technology, and imec for research
    and advancements. Ground breaking on the new fab was started in September 2023,
    with relevant industry companies such as ASML announcing plans to establish satellite
    offices to support the project.

    Technology Center - an organization borne from the Japanese Ministry of Economy,
    Trade and Industry. The LSTC will facilitate next-generation research between
    the US and Japan at the Rapidus facility. Part of the LSTC’s remit is to build
    vital silicon for use in both economies with market leading IP and drive the industry
    forward. It’s on that point that today Tenstorrent is announcing that it has struck
    a deal with the LSTC for its advanced high-performance RISC-V cores and chiplets.

- en: Tenstorrent’s custom RISC-V design is called Ascalon, with the largest variant
    designed for servers and enterprise workloads. The company will offer both the
    core IP and 128-core chiplets into the market. The LSTC is set to build its own
    AI accelerator for edge deployments, and requires a CPU chiplet alongside it for
    heterogeneous compute. Under this project, LSTC is aiming for developments in
    post-5G technology on a leading process, and in partnership with Rapidus, this
    project has spawned from a memorandum of cooperation signed with Tenstorrent back
    in 2023\. Tenstorrent last year also opened a research office in Japan, hiring
    local expertise in core and chip design, especially given their recent design
    wins in the region.

- en: Chief Architect of Tenstorrent, Wei-Han Lien, stated that “The edge AI accelerator
    will incorporate LSTC’s AI chiplet along with Tenstorrent’s RISC-V and peripheral
    chiplet technology. This pioneering strategy harnesses the collective capabilities
    of both organizations to use the adaptable and efficient nature of chiplet technology
    to meet the increasing needs of AI applications at the edge.” I interviewed Wei-han
    last year about the new RISC-V cores, which you can watch here.

    edge. It’s like an SEO fever dream. The whole thing with Rapidus is important
    on its own, with new transistors and a volume production fab in Japan by 2027
    (pilot line in 2025). From the Tenstorrent perspective, I’ll be interested to
    hear what exactly LSTC has planned when it comes to AI acceleration and how the
    Ascalon IP fits into that message (also, how much this deal with worth to them
    as an AI start-up). Hopefully LSTC will do some outreach about it, and in time,
    Rapidus will invite us for a fab tour.'
