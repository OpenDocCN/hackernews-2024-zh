- en: With time Microsoft's Linux kernel contributions have extended beyond just the
    initial business focus on Hyper-V support and other needs for Azure as well as
    around Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) to more general contributions. Microsoft
    has also hired more key Linux contributors along with stakes in other projects
    like systemd. Earlier this week were patches from a Microsoft engineer working
    out

- en: A set of fourteen patches were sent out today by Microsoft Linux engineer Easwar
    Hariharan who works on the Azure Linux plumbing, enabling of cloud silicon like
    Azure Cobalt, and virtualization affairs. This latest non-core-business-focus
    Linux contribution from Microsoft is cleaning up the language within the code
    to make it more inclusive. In particular, adjusting against the latest upstream
    I2C, SMBus, and I3C specifications to use appropriate terms.

- en: For the most part the terminology within the code and code comments is adjusted
    from master and slave to instead using controller and target (or client). But
    even to these patches some questions were raised as the industry specifications
    tend to refer to the new controller/target terminology as opposed to client as
    is used in most of these new kernel patches. Among upstream kernel developers
    there is apparently not a clear consensus yet on settling between client and target.
