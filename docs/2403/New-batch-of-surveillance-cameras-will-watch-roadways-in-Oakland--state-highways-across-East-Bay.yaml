- en: OAKLAND — The California Highway Patrol plans to significantly increase the
    number of cameras mounted along roadways across the East Bay, as part of a mounting
    bid by Gov. Gavin Newsom tamp down on crime and freeway shootings across the region.

    cameras across the East Bay — bringing the total number of cameras in the region
    overseen by the highway patrol to 480, according to state and local officials.
    The contract signaled a marked jump from previous plans for the California Highway
    Patrol [to take over installation and operation of a few hundred cameras](https://www.mercurynews.com/2024/02/13/newsoms-plan-to-send-chp-officers-to-tackle-oaklands-crime-crisis-how-would-it-work/)

    organized crime and improve public safety across the East Bay. And in a video
    he took at Hegenberger Road — an area that’s [gained attention](https://www.mercurynews.com/2024/03/18/oakland-crime-decline-hegenberger-road-in-n-out/)

    city here in Oakland.”

    law enforcement with the tools they need to effectively combat criminal activity
    and hold perpetrators accountable — building safer, stronger communities for all
    Californians,” the governor said in a statement.

    beyond the fact that 290 of them were expected to be “on and around surface streets”
    in Oakland’s city limits, while 190 cameras would be the East Bay’s state highways.

    gratitude for the cameras and stressed that improving public safety was a “top
    priority.” Her office confirmed Friday that the 480-camera tally included the
    roughly 290 cameras that had previously been slated to fall under the highway
    patrol’s purview.

    for vehicles by several identifying categories, including their “type, make, color,
    license plate state, missing/covered plates,” as well as bumper stickers, decals
    and roof racks, according to the governor’s announcement. The camera system also
    can provide real-time alerts when a vehicle sought by officers is spotted.

    announcement said. It will not be handed over to anyone “beyond California law
    enforcement,” and will comply with recent legal bulletins on data-storage and
    sharing by the California Department of Justice, the announcement said.

    chief of staff. It’s two days shorter than the city’s own 30-day data storage
    limit, and more than a month less than than CHP’s own 60-day retention limit.

    Oakland. In February, he announced [a surge of 120 highway patrol officers](https://www.mercurynews.com/2024/02/06/california-highway-patrol-sending-120-officers-to-oakland-to-combat-crime/)
    to the region — an operation that ended after just five days, leaving many local

    across the East Bay, resulting in scores of arrests.

    of our population and geography,” leading to concerns of a “whole wall of cameras”
    that, if not monitored closely, could be easily misused.

    a really significant amount of location data is now going to be in the hands of
    the state, and mischief can arise from that,” Hofer said. “That’s a shifting of
    the power dynamic that we never really had in the old days.”
