**Michael Copley:**

There's a recognition that plastic is so engrained in modern life, and it plays important roles in medical devices and other things, that it's almost impossible to envision a world where we move completely beyond plastic.

I think what people are talking about is reducing plastic production to a level that is more manageable with kind of recycling systems, getting rid of types of plastic that are especially hard to recycle, you can't recycle, being more transparent about what chemicals go into this stuff that again, make recycling hard, but it really does come down to when you talk to not just activists, but also businesses, increasingly, that regulation is going to play a big role.

And so that, you know, there was a hearing in the Senate and the head of SC Johnson, A big consumer goods company, said something to the effect of we need government regulation. Businesses can't do this on their own.

And I think, you know, again, that gets back in large part to the economics of this if companies don't have to deal with these costs. It's hard to imagine that they will in sort of a sustained way, create systems to deal with this if they don't have to.
