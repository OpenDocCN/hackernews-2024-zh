- en: The [Transportation Security Administration](https://jalopnik.com/even-death-wont-save-you-from-a-tsa-pat-down-1849479411)
    is testing new self-screening checkpoint lanes at [Harry Reid International Airport
    in Las Vegas](https://jalopnik.com/man-arrested-for-causing-panicked-crowds-to-flood-check-1849417722).
    The new process promises passengers shorter wait lines without the hassle of taking
    off shoes and outerwear or removing electronics from carry-on bags. While [the
    smoother procedure](https://jalopnik.com/airports-replacing-tsa-checks-with-self-checkout-1851114561)
    will be welcomed, it raises the question of whether the prior two decades of security
    theater were even worth it.

    in Las Vegas is only available to flyers with TSA PreCheck and instructions are
    currently only in English, according to [the Associated Press.](https://apnews.com/article/airport-security-selfservice-screening-e5b1b8a06512a95c47941985f2a19003)
    Passenger will be greeted by a screen with directions on how to get through the
    checkpoint on their own. They will be directed to put their belonging into a bin
    as usual, but the inspection system is fully automated. The bin return is fitted
    with an ultraviolet light emitter to keep everything sanitary between uses. The
    passenger will then head into a full-body scanner. There another video will show
    them how to pose. Christina Peach, a TSA branch manager, [told the AP:](https://apnews.com/article/airport-security-selfservice-screening-e5b1b8a06512a95c47941985f2a19003)'

    their own pace. It’s also about not feeling rushed.”

- en: The goal is to [minimize the amount of interaction](https://jalopnik.com/tsa-testing-facial-recognition-tech-at-16-airports-1850438008)
    a person would have with a TSA officer, including reducing the number of manual
    searches and pat-downs. Typically, it takes a dozen officers to staff two checkpoint
    lanes. The self-service lanes would cut that number down to eight. The agency
    has stated that personnel removed from these lanes would be assigned to broader
    tasks, and not lose their jobs. TSA employees, some of the lowest paid federal
    law enforcement agents, got their largest-ever pay increase in 2023, and the agency
    is fighting for [$1.4 billion in the federal budget](https://www.federaltimes.com/home/2024/02/14/tsa-achieved-historic-pay-raises-needs-budget-to-keep-them/)
    to cover it.

  zh: 目标是[减少人们与TSA官员的互动](https://jalopnik.com/tsa-testing-facial-recognition-tech-at-16-airports-1850438008)，包括减少手工搜索和搜身次数。通常，需要十几名官员来配备两个检查点通道。自助通道将把这一数字减少到八名。该机构表示，从这些通道中撤出的人员将被分配到更广泛的任务，而不会失去工作。作为联邦最低薪酬的执法人员之一，TSA员工在2023年获得了有史以来最大的加薪，并且该机构正在争取[$14亿美元的联邦预算](https://www.federaltimes.com/home/2024/02/14/tsa-achieved-historic-pay-raises-needs-budget-to-keep-them/)来覆盖这笔费用。
- en: While the TSA touts this trial as a prototype, program manager John Fortune
    told the AP that the scanners being used in Vegas are similar to those already
    in use. It feels like the TSA is always a day late and a dollar short to the detriment
    of the taxpayers and airline passengers. There’s a need for some screening process
    to keep [potentially dangerous items](https://jalopnik.com/weird-things-you-can-bring-through-airport-security-1850925419)
    out of the skies, but the current system seems far too cumbersome. The TSA hopes
    to expand the trial to other airports in the future, and it can’t happen fast
    enough.

  zh: 虽然TSA吹嘘这项试验是一个原型，项目经理约翰·福尔图告诉美联社，拉斯维加斯使用的扫描仪与已经在使用的那些相似。感觉TSA总是来得太迟，且对纳税人和航空旅客不利。有必要进行一些筛查过程，以防止天空中的[潜在危险物品](https://jalopnik.com/weird-things-you-can-bring-through-airport-security-1850925419)，但当前系统似乎太过繁琐。TSA希望将试验扩展到其他机场，这一过程不能够快速进行。
