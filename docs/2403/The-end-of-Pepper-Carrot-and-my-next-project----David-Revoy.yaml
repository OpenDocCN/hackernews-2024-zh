    at the moment. But now that I have a clearer picture, I think it's time to share

    change will **not happen tomorrow or next month**, I still have four more episodes
    to release before I get to my planned "~The End~". And as you know, it may take
    a while, especially since the episodes will be difficult to write and draw.

    the project, and I wanted every contributor, supporter, and reader to be informed
    about this new goal. It might give a more understandable perspective to actions
    I'll take and things I'll write. Also, I can't keep this project to myself forever.

    years old in May. It made me think a lot. I also always had a special admiration
    for authors who *knew* when to end their series.

    platforms (especially Patreon, Tippee) are set to trigger a payment "when the
    episode is released" and not "monthly". An extra budget to help me release the
    next four episodes will be welcome (I plan to end with episode 42 and finish with
    an ultimate 'book 5'). You can find the multiple ways to [patron me on this page](https://www.davidrevoy.com/static3/become-my-patron).

    Because the MFT project was simply the project at the root of Pepper&Carrot. But
    by the time I drew the first pilot, the first two characters of my first strip
    had become a success, and I just decided to carry on with them. I wrote a few

    art, pay to win social media, algorithms with cryptic rules that serve the interests
    of their platforms, search engines that only return commercial partnerships and
    AI pollution. But now I'm confident that I will find a way and bring interesting
