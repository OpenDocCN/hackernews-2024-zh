- en: Hey, I became a writer to get rich. I’ve always been in the writing business
    not just to write, and not just to make money, but also to make a lot of money
    — basically, to get rich at it. Why? Because speaking from experience, being poor
    sucks, and in the world we live in, things are a whole lot easier if you have
    a lot of money. The thing I do best in the world in a professional sense is writing,
    so if I were to become rich, getting rich through writing seemed like the most
    likely way for me to do it.

  zh: 嘿，我成为作家是为了致富。 我一直在写作业务中，不仅仅是为了写作，也不仅仅是为了赚钱，而是为了赚很多钱——基本上是通过写作致富。 为什么呢？ 因为从经验来看，穷真的很糟糕，在我们生活的世界中，如果你有很多钱，事情会变得容易得多。
    在职业意义上，我在世界上最擅长的事情就是写作，所以如果我想变得富有，通过写作变得富有似乎是我最有可能的途径。
- en: Making money — and making a lot of it — has always been part of my professional
    writing game plan. It’s one reason why I have been both shameless and unapologetic
    about the commercial aspects of my writing, whether it’s me working as a writing/editing
    consultant for business or writing accessible novels. The money I make from writing
    means less time now I have to devote to sources of income other than writing,
    and less time later having to find other sources of income when (inevitably) my
    career slows down from its current happy level. The money I make from writing
    allows me to do nothing other than writing. So it helps to make a lot of it if
    at all possible.

  zh: 赚钱——而且是大笔赚钱——一直是我的专业写作计划的一部分。 这就是为什么我对我的写作的商业化方面毫不掩饰和歉意的原因，无论是我作为商业写作/编辑顾问工作，还是写作通俗小说。
    我从写作中赚到的钱意味着我现在不必再花时间去做除了写作之外的收入来源，以及将来减少不得不寻找其他收入来源的时间（不可避免地，我的职业生涯从目前的快乐水平放缓下来）。
    我从写作中赚到的钱使我能够仅仅做写作。 因此，尽可能赚取更多的钱是很有帮助的。
- en: Do I write only to make money? No; I write for lots of other reasons as well.
    Do I only consider money when it comes to choosing writing projects? No; I’ve
    written things for the pure enjoyment of writing them as well as for other factors,
    although once I was done with them I often looked to see how best to profit from
    them. Does writing with money as a consideration and being rich as a goal mean
    that waving money at me is the magic key to unlock my participation in something?
    Not always, because not all money is created equal, and the money I’m looking
    at is not only what’s being waved in front of me now, but what taking the project
    will make available in the future. I can afford to look long term because making
    lots of money was always part of my thinking, and because it has been (along with
    many other factors including staggering good luck) I have the ability to turn
    down work that doesn’t meet the long-term financial goals, and work that just
    doesn’t appeal to me, for whatever reason.

  zh: 我写作仅仅是为了赚钱吗？ 不，我还有很多其他原因。 当选择写作项目时，我是否只考虑金钱？ 不，我也因为纯粹喜欢写作而写作，以及其他因素。 虽然一旦我完成它们，我经常会看看如何从中获利。
    写作时是否考虑到金钱并且致富是目标，这是否意味着向我挥舞钱财是解锁我参与某事的魔法钥匙？ 并不总是，因为并非所有金钱都是平等的，我看的金钱不仅是现在挥舞在我面前的，还有未来接受该项目将使之可获得的金钱。
    我能够着眼长远，因为赚大笔钱一直是我的考量之一，也因为这是（和许多其他因素，包括令人震惊的好运气）我有能力拒绝不符合长期财务目标和因为任何原因而对我没有吸引力的工作。
- en: (Nor do I think that everyone has to write with the goal of getting rich or
    making money. People like to quote/paraphrase Samuel Johnson, who once said “No
    one but a blockhead ever wrote except for money,” but Johnson is as full of shit
    as any writer on the subject. You can write for all sorts of reasons, money being
    only one. If you want to be a professional writer, writing for money helps. Otherwise?
    Optional.

  zh: （我也不认为每个人都必须以变富有或赚钱为目标写作。人们喜欢引用/改编塞缪尔·约翰逊的话，“只有傻瓜才会因为钱而写作”，但约翰逊在这个问题上和其他任何作家一样虚伪。你可以因为各种原因写作，赚钱只是其中之一。如果你想成为专业作家，写作赚钱是有帮助的。否则？随意而已。
- en: Also, sadly, acknowledging you write for money (or to get rich) will not guarantee
    success in that endeavor. Yes, that sucks. But there it is.)

  zh: 此外，令人遗憾的是，承认你是为了钱（或者为了变富有）而写作并不能保证在这个努力中取得成功。是的，这很糟糕。但事实就是这样。
- en: 'At the end of the day, however: This is what I do for money. I don’t want to
    have to do anything else, now and (as far as I can imagine) in the future. As
    luck would have it, much of what I like to write, and the style I prefer to write
    it in, appears to lend itself to the acquisition of money. So, yes, I write to
    become rich. It’s always been part of my plan. I suspect that there are at least
    a few other writers probably write for the same reason. I imagine, like me, it’s
    not their only reason. But it’s still a reason.'

  zh: 最后总结一下：这是我为了钱而做的事情。我不想做其他事情，现在和（据我所知）将来也是如此。幸运的是，我喜欢写的很多内容，以及我喜欢的写作风格，似乎都能赚钱。所以，是的，我写作是为了变得富有。这一直是我的计划的一部分。我怀疑至少还有几个其他作家可能出于同样的原因写作。我想象，像我一样，这并不是他们唯一的原因。但这仍然是一个原因。
- en: As a final thought on the point, one of the reasons that “no one writes to get
    rich” and “no one writes to make money” bug the crap out of me is that this is
    the sort of thinking, intentional or otherwise, that gives bad people cover to
    screw writers with regard to money, and gives uncertain writers a reason to shrug
    off being screwed. If you as a writer buy into the idea you can’t/won’t make money
    and that you can’t/won’t get rich, then you are more than halfway to ensuring
    that you won’t, in fact, make money (much less get rich).
  id: totrans-split-15

  zh: 最后一点想法是，关于“没有人是为了变富有而写作”和“没有人是为了赚钱而写作”的一个原因是，这种思维方式，无论是故意的还是无意识的，使坏人有借口来剥削作家的钱财，并使不确定的作家有理由对被剥削的事情不以为然。如果你作为作家认同你不能/不会赚钱，以及你不能/不会变富有的观念，那么你更有可能确保你实际上不会赚钱（更不用说变富有了）。
- en: So don’t accept it. When someone says it, feel free to contradict them. Some
    of us do write to make money, and maybe even to get rich. It doesn’t lessen what
    one does as a writer to acknowledge that making money, and maybe even hopefully
    making a lot of it, is one of the reasons to do it — if in fact it’s one of the
    reasons one does it. It is for me.

  zh: 所以不要接受这种说法。当有人这样说时，随时可以反驳他们。我们中的一些人确实是为了赚钱，甚至可能是为了变富有而写作。承认赚钱，甚至希望赚很多钱，是写作的原因之一——如果事实上这是你写作的原因之一。至少对我来说是这样。
