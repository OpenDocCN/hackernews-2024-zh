    Holladay, passed away in a hospital on Thursday, February 15th, following an accident
    at home that morning. David was a cancer survivor and valiantly battled multiple
    medical problems over his last five years.

    Caryn Navy, founded Raised Dot Computing (later Braille Planet) in 1981\. David’s
    early work on Apple II computers was groundbreaking in support of accessibility
    for blind users through speech and production of braille and of print from braille
    input. He went on to support production of print math from Nemeth Code mathematics
    braille. Later work at Raised Dot Computing culminated in the introduction of
    MegaDots, an innovative product with unparalleled support for braille formats.

    ever since. David’s work at Duxbury focused largely on extending the reach of
    DBT to many, many countries and languages around the world. Though confined to
    bed over the last several years of his life, David’s passion for braille wouldn’t
    allow him to rest. He was working until his very last day.

    do here at Duxbury.
