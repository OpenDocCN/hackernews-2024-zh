- en: One of the scientists who was fired from Canada's top infectious disease laboratory
    "intentionally" shared scientific information with China — potentially putting
    people's health in jeopardy — says an assessment by the Canadian Security Intelligence
    Service (CSIS).

    of Dr. Xiangguo Qiu and her husband Keding Cheng.

    brilliant results."
