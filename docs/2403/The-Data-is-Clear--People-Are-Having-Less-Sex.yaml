    published with the title “[Failure to Launch: Why Young People are Having Less
    Sex.](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2023-08-03/young-adults-less-sex-gen-z-millennials-generations-parents-grandparents)”

    partners in the prior year reached an all-time high of 38%.**'

    just 9% of women reported having at least 2 sexual partners. It was 12% of younger
    men. The widespread belief that these young adults are having a ton of casual
    sex is demonstrably false. **The common perception of ''sexually promiscuous''
    likely doesn''t align with a 25-year-old having only two sexual partners in a
    year, I''d guess.**'

    people having less sex; this trend spans virtually all adult age groups. People
    are having less sex.**

    behavior has declined significantly since the late 1980s**. For instance, 75%
    of all evangelicals reported having sex at least once a month in 1989\. In 2022,
    that number had dropped to 60%. For mainline Protestants, the decline was even
    bigger (75% to 51%). The share was also down for the non-religious. **79% of them
    were having monthly sex in 1989\. In 2022, that share hit an all-time low of 65%.**'

    ever have, though. In fact, they were having sex the most of any religious group
    in 2022\. Catholics reported a noticeable decline from 1989 through 2021, but
    then the numbers rebounded big time to 70% in 2022\.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But, those declines really got me thinking. About half of mainline Protestants
    did not have sex once a month in 2022\. What in the world could be causing that?
    Oh yeah - it’s the fact that they are really old. I wrote about that a while ago.
  prefs: []

    possible explanation is that as people age, sexual activity may become less frequent,
    particularly as they approach the eligibility age for Social Security benefits.
    So, let’s just check that out.'

    and then combined the last couple of waves of the GSS (2016-2022) and then used
    the same metric- the share having sex at least once a month. But I wanted to compare
    people of the same age in each time period in the survey. The results are pretty
    breathtaking.

    to their counterparts from previous decades.** In the early 1990s, more than 80%
    of individuals around the age of 25 reported engaging in sexual activity at least
    once a month. Recently, this figure has dropped to 72% among those in their mid
    twenties.'

- en: This eight-percentage-point decline is remarkably consistent across all age
    groups compared. It is evident that the peak period for regular sexual activity
    occurs between the ages of 30 and 40\. In the late 1990s, about 90% of folks said
    that was the case. In the most recent data, it’s much closer to 80%. The gap does
    narrow a bit for folks between 40 and 50 years old, but then it opens back up
    again when looking at those who are between 50 and 65 years of age.

    is also observed among those in their 40s, 50s, and 60s.**'

    first graph, let’s just restrict the sample to those between the ages of 25 and
    50\. That’s when sexual activity seems to be the most frequent.
  prefs: []

    point decline from 1989 to 2022\. But, the gaps still persist for every religious
    group. **An evangelical between the ages of 25 and 50 is six points less likely
    to have sex once a month compared to the same age group three decades ago.** For
    some groups the gap is small (two points for Black Protestants and three points
    for mainline). But for Catholics, the gap is nine points and it’s seven points
    for those with no religious affiliation. **There’s no group here that is clearly
    having more sex today than their counterparts from the early 1990s.**

    25 to 50 year olds.
  prefs: []

- en: Okay, the same pattern is clear here. **Everyone is having less sex today than
    they did around 1990.** The declines are fairly consistent, too. The gap is never
    smaller than six points but never larger than eight points. **But, pastors, I
    have a stat for you for your next sermon about sex! Among 25-50 year olds, the
    frequency of sex among those who never attend religious services is the same as
    those who are in your pews every week - 79% are having sexual relations at least
    once a month.**

    **But, Ryan, this is probably due (at least in part) to the decline of marriage
    in the general public.** Folks just aren’t walking down the aisle at nearly the
    same rate as they used to and that’s the root of the problem. If I just compared
    married couples in the earlier time period to married couples in the last few
    years, that would close this gap.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Nope. It does not. The left panel clearly refutes the idea that reduced sexual
    activity is simply a result of declining marriage rates. **Comparing currently
    married respondents from thirty years ago to recent years reveals a decline in
    sexual activity even among married couples.**
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now, let’s be clear - the gap is not huge. Among thirty year olds, it’s about
    four percentage points and it stays that way until you get to comparing those
    who are at least fifty years old. **But, married couples are even having less
    sex today than married folks during the George HW Bush administration.**

- en: '**The right panel, representing unmarried individuals, doesn''t provide a clear
    narrative.** Among young unmarried folks, it does look like sexual behavior has
    dropped off some when comparing the two time periods. But then among those who
    are between the ages of 40 and 55 years old, the data says that sexual frequency
    is actually higher in recent years than it was in the early 1990s. I think it’s
    fair to call that a wash. **Unmarried folks are probably having sex at about the
    same rate today as they were a few decades ago.**'

    less today than they were in the 1990s? I mean, I don’t think it takes too much
    imagination to conjure the most likely suspect - smartphones**. I think we can
    all admit that sexual behavior is somewhat related to boredom. When you have something
    to entertain yourself, then sex may not be top of mind.

    Postman’s thesis is simple - Huxley’s *[Brave New World](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brave_New_World)*
    was right. Our addiction to amusement is what will lead to the decline of civilization.
    For some, farming clicks and shares on social media gives us a dopamine hit that
    supplants the feelings derived from sexual contact. And, I have to admit, that
    is a really bleak thought.

    distant dystopian future in which women have not been able to become pregnant
    for eighteen years. Folks are listless and hopeless. There’s no one to pass their
    legacy on to. All the schools have closed. There will be no next generation. Who
    would have thought that Mark Zuckerberg building an app to try and meet girls
    would eventually be one of the causes of declining fertility. But, here we are.
