- en: In keeping with law enforcement’s grand tradition of taking [antiquated, invasive,
    and oppressive technologies, making them digital, and then calling it innovation](https://slate.com/technology/2020/02/rogues-gallery-facial-recognition-technology-history.html),
    police in the U.S. recently combined two existing dystopian technologies in a
    brand new way to violate civil liberties. A police force in California recently
    employed the new practice of taking a [DNA sample](https://www.fsigenetics.com/article/S1872-4973(23)00045-5/fulltext)
    from a crime scene, running this through a service provided by US company [Parabon
    NanoLabs](https://parabon-nanolabs.com/) that guesses what the perpetrators face
    looked like, and plugging [this rendered image into face recognition software](https://www.wired.com/story/parabon-nanolabs-dna-face-models-police-facial-recognition/#:~:text=Parabon%20NanoLabs%20ran%20the%20suspect's,using%20only%20crime%20scene%20evidence)
    to build a suspect list.

    On more than one occasion, police forces have been found to have fed [images of
    celebrities](https://www.vice.com/en/article/xwngn3/police-are-feeding-celebrity-photos-into-facial-recognition-software-to-solve-crimes)
    into face recognition software to generate suspect lists. In one case from 2017,
    the New York Police Department decided its suspect looked like Woody Harrelson
    and ran the actor’s image through the software to generate hits. Further, software
    provided by US company [Vigilant Solutions](https://www.motorolasolutions.com/en_us/products/command-center-software/public-safety-software/analysis-and-investigation.html?utm_source=vigilantsolutions.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=vigilantsolutions_redirect)
    enables law enforcement to create “a proxy image from a sketch artist or artist
    rendering” to enhance images of potential suspects so that face recognition software
    can match these more accurately.

    company that alleges it can create an image of the suspect’s face from their DNA.
    Parabon NanoLabs [claim](https://www.wired.com/story/parabon-nanolabs-dna-face-models-police-facial-recognition/#:~:text=Parabon%20NanoLabs%20ran%20the%20suspect's,using%20only%20crime%20scene%20evidence)
    to have built this system by training machine learning models on the DNA data
    of thousands of volunteers with 3D scans of their faces. It is currently the only
    company offering phenotyping and only in concert with a [forensic genetic genealogy
    investigation](https://www.eff.org/wp/forensic-genetic-genealogy-searches-what-defense-attorneys-need-know).
    The process is yet to be independently audited, and [scientists have affirmed](https://senseaboutscience.org/activities/making-sense-of-forensic-genetics/)
    that predicting face shapes—particularly from DNA samples—is not possible. But
    this has not stopped law enforcement officers from seeking to use it, or from
    running these fabricated images through face recognition software.

    face.'

- en: In 2020, a detective from the East Bay Regional Park District Police Department
    in California [asked](https://www.wired.com/story/parabon-nanolabs-dna-face-models-police-facial-recognition/#:~:text=Parabon%20NanoLabs%20ran%20the%20suspect's,using%20only%20crime%20scene%20evidence)
    to have a rendered image from Parabon NanoLabs run through face recognition software.
    This 3D rendering, called a [Snapshot Phenotype Report](https://snapshot.parabon-nanolabs.com/),
    predicted that—among other attributes—the suspect was male, had brown eyes, and
    fair skin. Found in police records published by [Distributed Denial of Secrets](https://ddosecrets.com/wiki/Distributed_Denial_of_Secrets),
    this appears to be the first reporting of a detective running an algorithmically-generated
    rendering based on crime-scene DNA through face recognition software. This puts
    a second layer of speculation between the actual face of the suspect and the product
    the police are using to guide investigations and make arrests. Not only is the
    artificial face a guess, now face recognition ([a technology known to misidentify
    people](https://www.cbsnews.com/sacramento/news/texas-macys-sunglass-hut-facial-recognition-software-wrongful-arrest-sacramento-alibi/)) 
    will create a “most likely match” for that face.

    threat to our individual privacy, free expression, information security, and social
    justice. Face recognition tech alone has an [egregious history](https://www.eff.org/aboutface)
    of misidentifying [people of color](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v81/buolamwini18a/buolamwini18a.pdf),
    especially [Black women](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v81/buolamwini18a/buolamwini18a.pdf),
    as well as failing to correctly identify [trans and nonbinary people](https://qz.com/1726806/facial-recognition-ai-from-amazon-microsoft-and-ibm-misidentifies-trans-and-non-binary-people/).
    The algorithms are [not always reliable](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0364021302000848),
    and even if the technology somehow had 100% accuracy, it would still be an [unacceptable
    tool](https://www.eff.org/aboutface) of invasive surveillance capable of identifying
    and tracking people on a massive scale. Combining this with fabricated 3D renderings
    from crime-scene DNA exponentially increases the likelihood of false arrests,
    and exacerbates [existing harms](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton/edmonton-police-issue-apology-for-controversial-use-of-dna-phenotyping-1.6608457)
    on communities that are already disproportionately over-surveilled by face recognition
    technology and discriminatory policing.

    actions. And despite the detective’s request violating Parabon NanoLabs’ [terms
    of service](https://web.archive.org/web/20160507204509/https://snapshot.parabon-nanolabs.com/terms),
    there is seemingly no way to ensure compliance. Pulling together criteria like
    skin tone, hair color, and gender does not give an accurate face of a suspect,
    and deploying these untested algorithms without any oversight places people at
    risk of being a suspect for a crime they didn’t commit. In one case from Canada,
    Edmonton Police Service [issued an apology](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton/edmonton-police-issue-apology-for-controversial-use-of-dna-phenotyping-1.6608457)

    otherwise these are the results. How much more evidence do law markers need that
    police cannot be trusted with this dangerous technology? How many more people
    need to be falsely arrested and how many more reckless schemes like this one need
    to be perpetrated before legislators realize this is not a sustainable method
    of law enforcement? [Cities across the United States](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2022/05/movement-ban-government-use-face-recognition)
    have already taken the step to ban government use of this technology, and [Montana](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2023/08/montanas-new-genetic-privacy-law-caps-ten-years-innovative-state-privacy)
    has specifically recognized a privacy interest in phenotype data. Other cities
    and states need to catch up or Congress needs to act before more people are hurt
    and our rights are trampled.
