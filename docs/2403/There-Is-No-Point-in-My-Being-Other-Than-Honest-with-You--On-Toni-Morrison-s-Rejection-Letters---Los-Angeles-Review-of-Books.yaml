    it to be,” Toni Morrison wrote to an aspiring novelist in 1977, “but it is a shuddering
    book and one that offers no escape for any reader whatsoever.” Still, Morrison,
    then a senior editor at Random House, liked the manuscript so much that, before
    responding, she passed it around the office to drum up support. The verdict was
    “intelligent,” but also “very ‘down,’ depressing, spiritually abrasive.” Whatever
    the merits of the writing, Morrison’s colleagues predicted, the potent mix of
    dissatisfaction, anger, and mournfulness would limit the book’s commercial appeal—and
    Morrison reluctantly agreed. “You don’t want to escape and I don’t want to escape,”
    her letter concludes, “but perhaps the public does and perhaps we are in the business
    of helping them do that.”

    尽管如此，当时任职于兰登书屋的莫里森如此喜欢这部手稿，以至于在回复之前，她把它传阅给办公室的同事以获得支持。评判是“聪明”的，但同时也是“非常‘低迷’，令人沮丧，精神上刺激性强。”

    with unimaginative taste, the industry’s aversion to risk-taking, and her own
    sense of creative constraint working at a commercial press (especially in the
    late 1970s and early ’80s; Morrison left editorial work to be a full-time novelist
    in the early 1980s). They sketch a “road not taken” in mainstream publishing,
    as experimental volumes, poetry, and short story collections were increasingly
    treated as suspect investments of editorial time and publishing house resources.
    Current market conditions made for “a losing proposition for the publisher and
    a hopeless one for short story writers,” Morrison informed one author, and unless
    they were penned by famous novelists, short story collections were “almost like
    the publication of poetry”—that is, “practically impossible to make a profit from.”
    In another, lengthy letter from 1977, Morrison outlined how the economics of a
    book project depended on the mechanisms of distribution. It wasn’t just that casual
    readers didn’t buy short story collections, but that the major institutions responsible
    for generating widespread enthusiasm and name recognition were also uninterested:
    “Book clubs do not make offers for collections of short stories; mass paperback
    houses do not make offers for collections of short stories by single authors and
    so we are left with the hope that ten or fifteen thousand people will go into
    a bookstore and ask for a particular author by name.” The rejection concludes
    with Morrison’s admission that “[t]here is no point in my being other than honest
    with you, you should continue to publish in magazines and if you ever decide to
    write a novel, I’d be delighted to look at it.”'

    that the language of sensory and embodied perception sets fiction apart from other
    genres, like biography. Morrison’s letters often bear this out. In 1979, she informed
    one writer that their “story is certainly worth telling,” but they “describe people
    and events from a distance instead of dramatizing them, developing scenes in which
    the reader discovers what kind of people they are instead of being told.” Vivid
    scenery and precise details offer readers room to maneuver, a way to discover
    a world that resonates. A couple of months earlier, she gave similar advice to
    a young Bebe Moore Campbell (who went on to become a best-selling author). And,
    addressing one colorful character who had evidently dropped by the Random House
    offices unannounced to pitch their memoir, Morrison warned about conflating an
    eventful life with a well-crafted story. “Your manuscript was no less interesting
    than you were,” she noted; however, to make it publishable, “you would have to
    add the artifice (or art) that you said you decidedly would not do.”'

  zh: ，像泰德·安德伍德（Ted Underwood）、安德鲁·派珀（Andrew Piper）和辛尼金（Sinykin）等文学评论家认为感官和具体知觉的语言将小说与传记等其他流派区分开来。莫里森的信件经常印证这一点。1979年，她告知一位作家，他们的“故事确实值得讲述”，但他们“描述人物和事件的方式过于冷漠，而不是通过戏剧化的手法，开发场景，让读者发现他们是什么样的人。”
    生动的风景和精确的细节为读者提供了操控空间，一种发现共鸣世界的方式。几个月前，她给年轻的贝贝·摩尔·坎贝尔（Bebe Moore Campbell）提供了类似的建议（后来成为畅销作者）。而且，对于一个明显未经预约来随机之家办公室推销自传的丰富多彩人物，莫里森警告说，不要混淆充满事件的生活与精心打磨的故事。“您的手稿与您本人一样有趣，”她指出；然而，为了使其可出版，“您必须添加您明确表示不会做的艺术（或艺术品）。”
- en: 'What Morrison repeatedly stressed, trusting her exceptional acuity as both
    a reader and writer, is that writing is a skill of its own—one that doesn’t automatically
    follow from intellectual brilliance, nor from simply being an interesting or important
    person. She told one young writer that his ideas were good, but warned that concept
    was the first and lowest hurdle he would face:'

  zh: 莫里森反复强调，她作为读者和作家的卓越洞察力信任写作本身是一种技能——这并不是自智慧的表现，也不是简单成为一个有趣或重要人物的结果。她告诉一位年轻作家，他的想法很好，但警告说概念是他将面对的第一个也是最低的障碍：
- en: 'Your work needs force—some manner of making these potentially powerful characters
    alive and of giving texture to the setting. Giving details about the people—more
    than what they look like—what idiosyncrasies they have, what distinguished mannerism—and
    details about *where* the action takes place: what is in the room, what is the
    light like, the smells, etc.—all of that would give us texture and tone.'

- en: Characteristically, this detailed rejection ends with encouragement, as Morrison
    told the author, “I hope you are able to work on [your manuscript] to give it
    the vitality it certainly deserves.”

- en: Morrison left Random House in 1983\. In the years leading up to her departure,
    she sought to make more time for her own writing by commuting to the office only
    once a week. Yet she continued to read unsolicited submissions. She apologized
    to one author for responding almost a year after her manuscript landed on her
    desk. (She found the submission “messy and disjointed” and had “no idea what or
    where a novel might be,” but nevertheless concluded that “there is such power
    and grit and a funny kind of lyricism that I have to tell you to try to make something
    of it”—and instructed the author to send it back to her when she had.) To an unpublished
    writer from South Webster, Ohio, Morrison observed that “there is a great deal
    of vitality in your writing and a freshness that is welcoming,” though, she warned,
    “it needs a lot of work with structure and dialog.” Even so, she promised to “give
    the entire manuscript a reading” if he finished.

  zh: Morrison 在 1983 年离开了 Random House。在她离开之前的几年里，为了给自己写作留更多时间，她每周只通勤一次到办公室。然而，她继续阅读未经请求的提交稿件。她向一位作者道歉，因为他的稿件在她的桌子上放了将近一年才回复（她发现提交的内容“杂乱无章”且“完全不知道小说可能在哪里或者是什么”，但仍然总结道：“这其中蕴含着强大的力量和坚韧以及一种有趣的抒情风格，所以我必须告诉你要试着发挥它的潜力”——并指示作者在完善后再次提交给她）。对于来自俄亥俄州南韦伯斯特的一位未出版作家，Morrison
    观察到“你的写作中充满了活力和令人欢迎的新鲜感”，尽管她警告说“在结构和对话方面需要大量的工作”。即便如此，她也承诺道：“如果你完成了，我会阅读整篇手稿的”。
- en: 'Remarkably, this was an offer Morrison extended repeatedly, to unpublished,
    unknown writers—some of whom had sent only a handful of what she believed to be
    promising pages. Unsurprisingly, her rejection notes are a practiced repertoire
    of graceful ways to say “no” and “goodbye”: “Enclosed herewith”; “I decline”;
    “Please accept my genuine regrets”; “Best of luck”; “With regards and regrets.”
    But they’re an archive of Morrison’s faith in and sheer love for the written word—and
    of her kindness.'

  zh: 令人惊讶的是，这是 Morrison 反复向无名作家提出的提议，其中一些只寄来了她认为有前途的几页内容。毫不奇怪，她的拒绝信笔下有许多优雅的方式来说“不”和“再见”：“随函附上”；“我拒绝”；“请接受我真诚的遗憾”；“祝你好运”；“致以问候和遗憾”。但它们是
    Morrison 对文字的信仰和纯粹的爱的档案——以及她的善意的体现。
- en: 'Throughout her career, Morrison balanced her literary commitments, her commercial
    responsibilities, and her concerns about the industry overall. The increasing
    friction between these likely contributed to her eventual decision to leave publishing
    entirely. Morrison’s rejection letters represent perhaps her clearest articulation
    of this tension, often for the benefit of young authors who had no claim on her
    attention other than throwing a piece of writing over the Random House transom.
    Such writers, she warned, faced uphill battles to get their words into print.
    “The material is interesting,” she concluded in one letter, “but not the writing:
    it needs a lot of work to give it the energy a story must have.”'

  zh: 在她的职业生涯中，Morrison 在她的文学承诺、商业责任和对整个行业的关注之间保持平衡。这些方面之间日益增加的摩擦可能促使她最终决定完全离开出版界。Morrison
    的拒绝信也许是她对这种紧张局势最清晰的表达，这常常是为了年轻作家的利益，这些作家除了将一篇写作扔到 Random House 的投递口外，几乎无法获得她的注意。她警告这样的作家，要让他们的文字印刷出来，将面临艰难的斗争。“这些材料很有趣，”她在一封信中总结道，“但不是写作：它需要大量的工作，才能给它必须具备的能量。”
