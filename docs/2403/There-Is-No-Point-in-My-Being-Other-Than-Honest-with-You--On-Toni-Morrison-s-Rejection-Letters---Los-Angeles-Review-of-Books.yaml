    it to be,” Toni Morrison wrote to an aspiring novelist in 1977, “but it is a shuddering
    book and one that offers no escape for any reader whatsoever.” Still, Morrison,
    then a senior editor at Random House, liked the manuscript so much that, before
    responding, she passed it around the office to drum up support. The verdict was
    “intelligent,” but also “very ‘down,’ depressing, spiritually abrasive.” Whatever
    the merits of the writing, Morrison’s colleagues predicted, the potent mix of
    dissatisfaction, anger, and mournfulness would limit the book’s commercial appeal—and
    Morrison reluctantly agreed. “You don’t want to escape and I don’t want to escape,”
    her letter concludes, “but perhaps the public does and perhaps we are in the business
    of helping them do that.”

    Usually typed on pink, yellow, or white carbonless copy paper, and occasionally
    bearing Random House’s old logo and letterhead, these are now filed among her
    correspondence in the Random House archives at Columbia University’s Rare Book
    & Manuscript Library. While many of the letters were mailed to New York, Boston,
    and even Rome, others were sent to writers in more obscure places; some are addressed
    to “general delivery” in various small towns across the United States.

    in their suggestions, and direct in their criticism. The letters themselves—generally
    one, two at most, exchanged with a given writer—constitute an asymmetrical archive.
    On one end of each communiqué is the ghost of a submitted manuscript (absent from
    the archive after being returned to the sender, although in some cases survived
    by a cover letter). On the other is a rejection from Morrison, sometimes brusque
    yet typically offering something more than an expression of disinterest—notes
    on craft, character development, the need for more (or less) drama. But also:
    Autopsies of a changing, and in many ways diminishing, publishing industry; frustrations
    with the tastes of a reading public; and sympathies for poets, short story writers,
    and other authors drawn to commercially hopeless genres.'

    of cash to fuel a wave of acquisitions and two mergers, purchasing Alfred A. Knopf
    and Then, in 1965, Random House itself was acquired by RCA, an electronics company,

    speech at the American Writers Congress, she warned that the business had already
    tipped too far away from the work of writers and editors, so that “the vitality
    in the arts which promoters like to talk about is false. Beneath the headlines
    of blockbusters and bestsellers, underneath the froth of the book fairs,” she
    averred, “something is terribly wrong.”

    tend to reward the precisely honed, predictable commodity. Literary scholar Dan
    Sinykin recently argued that the conglomerate era in publishing has transformed
    the fictional works that get acquired, published, and placed (strategically) on
    store shelves. “Conglomerate fiction,” which is often genre fiction—that is, more
    or less easily labeled as mystery, romance, or science fiction—is less distinguishable
    by its formal characteristics than by its origins within a “conglomerate superorganism”
    of marketers, acquisitions editors, dust-jacket designers, and many others whose
    jobs are on the line and therefore have a stake in a given book’s success. The
    shift hasn’t been unique to fiction. If the conglomerate era produced corporate

    rejections with diagnoses of an ailing publishing business, growing frustrations
    with unimaginative taste, the industry’s aversion to risk-taking, and her own
    sense of creative constraint working at a commercial press (especially in the
    late 1970s and early ’80s; Morrison left editorial work to be a full-time novelist
    in the early 1980s). They sketch a “road not taken” in mainstream publishing,
    as experimental volumes, poetry, and short story collections were increasingly
    treated as suspect investments of editorial time and publishing house resources.
    Current market conditions made for “a losing proposition for the publisher and
    a hopeless one for short story writers,” Morrison informed one author, and unless
    they were penned by famous novelists, short story collections were “almost like
    the publication of poetry”—that is, “practically impossible to make a profit from.”
    In another, lengthy letter from 1977, Morrison outlined how the economics of a
    book project depended on the mechanisms of distribution. It wasn’t just that casual
    readers didn’t buy short story collections, but that the major institutions responsible
    for generating widespread enthusiasm and name recognition were also uninterested:
    “Book clubs do not make offers for collections of short stories; mass paperback
    houses do not make offers for collections of short stories by single authors and
    so we are left with the hope that ten or fifteen thousand people will go into
    a bookstore and ask for a particular author by name.” The rejection concludes
    with Morrison’s admission that “[t]here is no point in my being other than honest
    with you, you should continue to publish in magazines and if you ever decide to
    write a novel, I’d be delighted to look at it.”'

    was humane even with the most hopeless of proposals, like those she received from
    aspiring crossover academics. In 1978, Morrison told a Berkeley professor that
    the “commercial requirements of Random House are such that literary research and
    criticism does not figure in its plans.” Still, Morrison’s letter suggests that
    she’d read the entire manuscript, providing suggestions and the consolation that
    “unless you have some very ‘hip’ (and probably inaccurate) sociological view to
    tag on to the literary criticism, it is received with very little enthusiasm.”

    is a place where it helps to have friends and connections, industry contacts and
    people who may owe you (or someone you know) a favor. To that end, she occasionally
    ended a rejection by offering her name as a kind of passport with which hopeful
    authors might navigate the borders erected by other cultural gatekeepers. In 1977,
    she advised one young writer to find an agent and directed him toward the legendary
    literary agents Georges Borchardt and Peter Matson, adding, “When you write to
    them you may say that although I could not take your manuscript myself, I was
    very much in love with it, and I’m willing to put it in writing.” She pointed
    another young radical in the direction of Jules Geller, a former colleague of
    Morrison’s who went on to work at the

    Morrison briefly at Random House before leaving to become a founding editor at
    Howard University Press. Even in her rejections, Morrison was building a network

    commercial publishing.'

    experience of reading a work under review. In one 1978 rejection of a modern Western,
    she wrote that “it simply wasn’t interesting enough—the excitement, the ‘gut’s,
    just weren’t there. I am returning it to you herewith.” This sustained desire
    to explain her rejections elicits a decades-long, fragmentary discourse on style,
    on how to advance a plot, on when a manuscript’s structure needs to be more unexpected,
    or—more commonly—on when it needs to be simplified. Readers are needy creatures,
    Morrison’s letters suggest, demanding both drama and organization, the space and
    information to make discoveries themselves yet a clear enough path so as not to
    feel lost. In 1975, she described one manuscript as “put together in a way that
    made it difficult to enjoy. The scenes are too short and packed too tightly. Motives
    were lacking.” She forestalled any possible rejoinders about the virtues of avant-garde
    abstraction by professing her awareness that “the

    that the language of sensory and embodied perception sets fiction apart from other
    genres, like biography. Morrison’s letters often bear this out. In 1979, she informed
    one writer that their “story is certainly worth telling,” but they “describe people
    and events from a distance instead of dramatizing them, developing scenes in which
    the reader discovers what kind of people they are instead of being told.” Vivid
    scenery and precise details offer readers room to maneuver, a way to discover
    a world that resonates. A couple of months earlier, she gave similar advice to
    a young Bebe Moore Campbell (who went on to become a best-selling author). And,
    addressing one colorful character who had evidently dropped by the Random House
    offices unannounced to pitch their memoir, Morrison warned about conflating an
    eventful life with a well-crafted story. “Your manuscript was no less interesting
    than you were,” she noted; however, to make it publishable, “you would have to
    add the artifice (or art) that you said you decidedly would not do.”'

    she sought to make more time for her own writing by commuting to the office only
    once a week. Yet she continued to read unsolicited submissions. She apologized
    to one author for responding almost a year after her manuscript landed on her
    desk. (She found the submission “messy and disjointed” and had “no idea what or
    where a novel might be,” but nevertheless concluded that “there is such power
    and grit and a funny kind of lyricism that I have to tell you to try to make something
    of it”—and instructed the author to send it back to her when she had.) To an unpublished
    writer from South Webster, Ohio, Morrison observed that “there is a great deal
    of vitality in your writing and a freshness that is welcoming,” though, she warned,
    “it needs a lot of work with structure and dialog.” Even so, she promised to “give

    of this tension, often for the benefit of young authors who had no claim on her
    attention other than throwing a piece of writing over the Random House transom.
