- en: The lawsuit was filed in 2017 by Tesla worker Marcus Vaughn, who claimed that
    the factory production floor was a “hotbed of racist behavior.” According to the
    complaint, co-workers and supervisors routinely used racial slurs, and employee
    complaints to human resources went largely unanswered.

    trial. During the first, the jury would decide whether Tesla failed to do enough
    to prevent discrimination and harassment. If the jurors find Tesla liable, then
    in a second phase the plaintiffs would pursue their claims for damages.
