- en: Web Distribution, available in iOS 17.5, lets authorized developers distribute
    their iOS apps to users in the European Union (EU) directly from a website owned
    by the developer. Apple will provide access to APIs that facilitate the distribution
    of developers’ apps from the web, integrate with system functionality, back up
    and restore users’ apps, and more. Apps offered through Web Distribution must
    meet Notarization requirements to protect platform integrity, like all iOS apps,
    and can only be installed from a website domain that the developer has registered
    in App Store Connect.

- en: Using App Store Connect, developers can easily download signed binary assets
    and host them on their website for distribution. To install apps from a developer’s
    website, users will first need to approve the developer to install apps in Settings
    on their iPhone. When installing an app, a system sheet will display information
    that developers have submitted to Apple for review, like the app name, developer
    name, app description, screenshots, and system age rating.
