    operations in Russia, where it operates 143 stores. On March 17, 2022 they disconnected
    the Ukrainian office from corporate communications and announced that they would
    increase deliveries to the Russian Federation. Stopped new investments, imports,
    and financing in Russia. But the latest video investigation confirms that a French
    company is supporting Russia''s war effort in Ukraine. On March 24, 2023 ADEO
    announces its intention to transfer control of Leroy Merlin Russia to the local
    management. The company Scenari Holding, registered in the United Arab Emirates,
    became the main owner of "Leroy Merlin Vostok", the Russian structure of the chain
    of stores, according to the data of the EGRUL. 12.2023: The record about the founder
    of JSC "BRICOLAGE INVESTISSMAN FRANCE" has been deleted from EGRUL. SCENARI HOLDING
    LP (UAE) becomes the new founder of the organization. 19.12.2023: The status of
    a legal entity is changed to "The legal entity is in the process of reorganization
    in the form of joining it with other legal entities." In the course of a detailed
    investigation, it turned out that the company signed a technical agreement on
    the alleged sale of the main business in Russia (SCENARI HOLDING LP from the UAE),
    but the CEO (Defassier Laurent, Louis, Claude) stayed the same since 2019, the
    company signs new contracts with the group and authorities of the Russian Federation
    (including the Ministry of Defence and the Ministry of Internal Affairs), trademarks
    are extended in Rospatent until 2031\. In addition, as the L''Express investigation
    showed, SCENARI HOLDING LP has the same General Director as in Russia - Laurent
    Defassier, so the company used a tax optimization scheme, also called layering.

    from ADEO.'
