- en: It's easy to pick on AI, because, well, it's costing a whole lot and providing,
    at best, dubious benefits. One of the easiest criticisms to lob at it is that
    it's extractive — whether you're pointing at public knowledge, creative work or
    resources and I think that's all quite fair. But it's not unique to AI and it's
    not particularly unique to the tech industry.

    similarly extractive of energy and funneled money from well-meaning personal investors
    and users to owners, investors and advocates that were already rich.

- en: Social media offered the promise of connection and the ability to bridge distances
    to keep in touch with everyone you've ever met. This was all offered for “free”
    up front and, you guessed it, has become increasingly extractive over time. This
    segment of the industry came for your privacy as they fed your data to black-boxed
    algorithms, your attention that they abused to show you an ever-increasing number
    of ads and the social graphs they could use to hold you hostage until they strip
    mine, well, your mind (I guess).

    to TV back in the day but it's fair to say what we're dealing with here is, while
    considerably newer, far worse.

- en: I don't think we've really seen much on offer that's pitches as an innovation
    and truly lives up to the process, at least not recently. Ride-hailing services?
    Those flouted regulations, hooked users on cheap prices, drove down wages and
    made employment more precarious. Now prices are up and wages for drivers are down.
    Where did that value go? (Hint, to the folks that arrived to offer a “new” way
    to mediate the transaction with a platform opaque to everyone outside of them).

    analogous to cable, complete with shrinking catalogs. I follow one team in one
    sport and simply watching them play requires navigating a byzantine hellscape
    created by competing broadcast agreements. We have music streaming services that
    pay musicians pennies for their work.

    are fundamentally unsound, ongoing concentration and consolidation, a compulsion
    to demonstrate the possibility of unending growth which is, frankly, impossible.'

- en: All of this leaves me wanting simpler businesses with simpler motives — I'll
    pay, you provide a product or service commensurate with the value. No opaque policies,
    no concerns about data. I'd love for you to be profitable and sustainable, without
    being obsessed with scale. I'd love you to build products for the customers, not
    the speculators, that have invested in you.

- en: I want tools that solve demonstrated problems, not speculative products that
    externalize problems. I'm not sure I'll be getting that. Instead, we'll likely
    accelerate towards a future pushed by the same folks that built, well, all of
    this. I expect all of this acceleration will work out about as well as all that
    altruism did.
