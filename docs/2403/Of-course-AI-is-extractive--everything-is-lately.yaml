- en: It's easy to pick on AI, because, well, it's costing a whole lot and providing,
    at best, dubious benefits. One of the easiest criticisms to lob at it is that
    it's extractive — whether you're pointing at public knowledge, creative work or
    resources and I think that's all quite fair. But it's not unique to AI and it's
    not particularly unique to the tech industry.

    AI 的独有问题，也不特别是技术行业的独有问题。

- en: We seem to, hopefully, be able to place crypto in the rearview mirror. It was
    similarly extractive of energy and funneled money from well-meaning personal investors
    and users to owners, investors and advocates that were already rich.

- en: Social media offered the promise of connection and the ability to bridge distances
    to keep in touch with everyone you've ever met. This was all offered for “free”
    up front and, you guessed it, has become increasingly extractive over time. This
    segment of the industry came for your privacy as they fed your data to black-boxed
    algorithms, your attention that they abused to show you an ever-increasing number
    of ads and the social graphs they could use to hold you hostage until they strip
    mine, well, your mind (I guess).

  zh: 社交媒体曾承诺连接和能够桥接距离，与你曾经遇见的每个人保持联系。这一切在最初都是“免费”的，你猜对了，随着时间推移，它变得越来越具有提取性。这一行业的这一部分侵入你的隐私，将你的数据馈送给黑匣子算法，滥用你的注意力来展示越来越多的广告，并使用你的社交图谱来扣押你，直到他们彻底开采你的心智（我猜）。
- en: It feels trite to criticize social media on a basis similar to that applied
    to TV back in the day but it's fair to say what we're dealing with here is, while
    considerably newer, far worse.

- en: I don't think we've really seen much on offer that's pitches as an innovation
    and truly lives up to the process, at least not recently. Ride-hailing services?
    Those flouted regulations, hooked users on cheap prices, drove down wages and
    made employment more precarious. Now prices are up and wages for drivers are down.
    Where did that value go? (Hint, to the folks that arrived to offer a “new” way
    to mediate the transaction with a platform opaque to everyone outside of them).

  zh: 我认为我们并没有真正看到很多被推销为创新并真正符合预期的产品，至少最近没有。打车服务？它们藐视规定，以廉价价格吸引用户，压低工资，使就业更加不稳定。现在价格上涨，司机的工资却在下降。这些价值都去哪了？（提示，去了那些提供“新”交易方式的人，他们所在的平台对外部人员来说是不透明的）。
- en: We have streaming platforms that are actively rolling back up into something
    analogous to cable, complete with shrinking catalogs. I follow one team in one
    sport and simply watching them play requires navigating a byzantine hellscape
    created by competing broadcast agreements. We have music streaming services that
    pay musicians pennies for their work.

  zh: 我们有一些流媒体平台正在积极回归成类似有线电视的东西，包括收缩的目录。我只关注一支球队的一项运动，仅仅观看他们的比赛就需要应对由竞争广播协议创建的复杂地狱般的场景。我们有音乐流媒体服务付给音乐人的报酬仅是一文不值。
- en: 'It''s easy to point broadly at different causes: investment in businesses that

    pay, you provide a product or service commensurate with the value. No opaque policies,

- en: I want tools that solve demonstrated problems, not speculative products that
    externalize problems. I'm not sure I'll be getting that. Instead, we'll likely
    accelerate towards a future pushed by the same folks that built, well, all of

    altruism did.
