 The portion of Americans who listen to any kind of online audio, and the portion who listen to podcasts, have both reached new record highs, according to The Infinite Dial® an annual survey from Edison Research with support from [Audacy](http://www.audacyinc.com/?utm_source=podnews.net&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=podnews.net%3A2024-03-28), [Cumulus Media](https://www.cumulusmedia.com/?utm_source=podnews.net&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=podnews.net%3A2024-03-28), and [SiriusXM Media](https://www.siriusxmmedia.com/?utm_source=podnews.net&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=podnews.net%3A2024-03-28).

For the last 26 years, Edison Research’s Infinite Dial® has tracked key consumer media and technology usage among the U.S. population. Earlier today, Edison Research Vice President Megan Lazovick presented the latest benchmark data on weekly and monthly podcast consumption, as well as insights into the evolving landscape of online audio listening, AM/FM radio engagement, smart speaker utilization, social media usage, and other digital media behaviors, at the Podcast Movement Evolutions conference in Los Angeles.

**Smart speaker ownership appears to have plateaued, but the number of smart speakers per owner continues to rise:**

*   34% of the population age 12+ report owning a smart speaker, down from 36% in 2023

*   **Nearly half of** smart speaker owners (43%) own three or more of the devices

**Twitter/X usage sees a sharp decline after Elon Musk acquisition:**

*   19% of those age 12+ are currently ever using X (formerly known as Twitter), a **30%** drop from the findings in the 2023 Infinite Dial study

Lazovick said, “The Infinite Dial was created for those looking to understand emerging technologies and the infinite options available to consumers. If you have tuned into the webinar or used the findings at any point in the past, then you are a part of that legacy of curious people helping to keep it going. We hope you are as excited as we are to have access to this rigorous research, free and available to all.”
