- en: Company review site Glassdoor has apparently begun adding people’s full names,
    and other personally identifiable information (PII) to user profiles without their
    consent, and expectedly, users are fuming.

- en: For the uninitiated, Glassdoor is a website where people write reviews of their
    previous and current employers, bosses, and companies. As one might expect, the
    reviews are often negative, as they discuss toxic company culture, shady practices,
    and more. For that reason, people enjoyed their anonymity on Glassdoor, creating
    user profiles that held no concrete information about who they were.

    identities of people who left bad reviews about them, possibly looking to retaliate
    in one way or another.

    not unlike LinkedIn. It was integrated with the review site last year, meaning
    that every Glassdoor user also got a Fishbowl account.

    being combined. Consequently, people with anonymous Glassdoor accounts suddenly
    found themselves doxed, thanks to data pulled from Fishbowl.

- en: Not giving their consent for this also makes no difference. One user explicitly
    demanded not to be doxed this way, and Glassdoor denied the request, saying the
    only solution would be to terminate the account and request all the data to be
    deleted. The entirety of this user experience can be found in Ars Technica’s writeup
    [here](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/03/glassdoor-adding-users-real-names-job-info-to-profiles-without-consent/?comments=1&comments-page=1).

    one user said, “How to kill your own business and destroy years of trust invested
    in you by your users in one easy step”, while the other described Glassdoor’s
    move as “spectacularly stupid”.
