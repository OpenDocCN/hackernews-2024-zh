- en: '**"Don’t even bother," the upholsterer** told me. I was on the phone, asking
    for a theoretical quote to reupholster a five-year-old or so midrange sofa, which
    cost more than $1,000 when new. That task, the upholsterer told me, would run
    me several times more than the couch was originally worth, and, owing to its construction,
    it was now worth nowhere near its sale price. The upholsterer proceeded to lecture
    me, in a helpful, passionate, and sometimes kindly manner, about how sofas made
    in the past 15 years or so are absolute garbage, constructed of sawdust compressed
    and bonded with cheap glue, simple brackets in place of proper joinery, substandard
    spring design, flimsy foam, and a lot of staples.'
