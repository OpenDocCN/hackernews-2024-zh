    have been street name changes. Let me give you a moment to think about that. The
    city council is congress to the mayor’s president. Its 51 members monitor the
    country’s largest school system and police force, and decide land use for one
    of the most densely populated places on Earth. Its budget is larger than most
    states’, its population bigger than all but 11 states. On top of that, New York’s
    streets have largely been named or numbered since the 19th century, with some
    street names, such as Stuyvesant and the Bowery, dating from when Manhattan was
    little more than a Dutch trading station.

    you are on West 103rd Street, you are also on Humphrey Bogart Place. Or you might
    be on Broadway and West 65th Street (Leonard Bernstein Place), West 84th (Edgar
    Allan Poe Street), or East 43rd (David Ben-Gurion Place). Recently, the city council
    approved the Wu-Tang Clan District in Staten Island, Christopher Wallace Way (after

    brutality and pushed for community control of schools. But he also advocated violence
    and espoused unapologetically racist ideas. When a Haitian woman accused a Korean
    shop owner of assault, Carson organised a boycott of all Korean grocery stores,
    where protesters urged black people not to give their money to “people who don’t
    look like us”. Asked if he was antisemitic, Carson responded that he was “antiwhite.
    Don’t limit my antis to just one group of people.” The mayor at the time, Michael

    should have a street named after him in this city than Sonny Carson.”'

    more crack houses than the New York police department. Don’t judge his life on
    his most provocative statements, his supporters asked. Still, Carson was controversial
    in the African American community as well. When the black councilman Leroy Comrie
    abstained from the street name vote, Barron’s aide Viola Plummer suggested that
    his political career was over, even if it took an “assassination”. Comrie was
    assigned police protection. (Plummer insists she meant a career assassination

    out that New York had long honoured flawed men, including Thomas Jefferson, a
    slave-owning “paedophile”. “We might go street-name-changing crazy around here
    to get rid of the names of these slave owners,” he called out to the angry crowd.

    Until 1991, few people outside of West Virginia’s small cities had any street

    to a house in West Virginia described as having chickens out front, only to see
    that every house had chickens out front. Along those lanes, I was told, people
    come out on their porches and wave at strangers, so paramedics couldn’t tell who
    was being friendly and who was flagging them down. Ron Serino, a firefighter in
    Northfork (population 429) explained how he would tell frantic callers to listen
    for the blare of the truck’s siren. A game of hide-and-seek would then wind its
    way through the serpentine hollows. “Getting hotter?” he would ask over the phone.

    a loan in the Depression.) But often it’s not the particular name, but the naming
    itself. Everyone knows everyone else, the protesters said again and again. When
    a 33-year-old man died of an asthma attack after the ambulance got lost, his mother
    told the newspaper: “All they had to do was stop and ask somebody where we lived.”

    residents know both their neighbours and the rich history of their land. They
    see things outsiders don’t see. I, on the other hand, now use GPS to navigate
    the town I grew up in. I wondered whether we might see our spaces differently
    if we didn’t have addresses. And far from being outlandish, the residents’ fears
    turn out to be justifiable, even reasonable. Addresses aren’t just for emergency
    services. They also exist so people can find you, police you, tax you and try

    slums, often with higher-quality housing, where the tenants lease their land.

    The estimated 3 million Kolkatans who live in the city’s 5,000 slums are often

    poor economic growth in the developing world: insecure land ownership. In other
    words, there was no centralised database of who owned any given property, which
    made it difficult to buy or sell land, or use it to get credit. And it’s hard
    to tax land when you don’t know who owns it. Ideally, countries would have cadastres,
    public databases that register the location, ownership and value of land. A good
    cadastral system makes the buying and selling of land, as well as the collection
    of taxes, easy. When you buy a piece of land, you (and the government’s tax offices)
    can be sure that you – and you alone – own it.'

    Ireland, sees its work as so important. Months before I arrived in Kolkata, I
    met Alex Pigot, the charismatic co-founder of Addressing the Unaddressed, 5,000
    miles away in Dublin. Pigot is a businessman, with distinguished white hair, a
    salt-and-paprika beard and an elegantly rumpled linen jacket. He started out as
    a Christmas postman in Ireland in the 70s, and later began a mailing business
    in the 80s. Mailing services only work with accurate street addresses, so he quickly
    became an expert.

    had started a charity called called [The Hope Foundation](https://www.hopechild.org/)
    in Kolkata. Forrest told him she was looking for help to do a census of the slums
    the charity served. Pigot offered the only real expertise he had: addresses.'

    slums were no bigger than the restaurant booth we were sitting in, so he had to
    tweak the technology. He had to scrap the original plastic placards for the addresses
    because residents worried they would fall off their doors and cows would eat them.
    Originally, the team had printed maps of the slums, complete with each home’s
    new “[GO Code](http://www.gocode.in/)”, on large plastic sheets so people could
    find their way around. But they soon disappeared, as residents used the sheets
    to plug holes in their roofs during the monsoons. But slowly Pigot and the Addressing
    the Unaddressed team began to develop systems that worked.

    slum near Kolkata’s port, where trucks flying by stir up dust all day, every day.
    In an alley so narrow two people could not stand side by side, one of Subhashis’s
    crew held a computer in one arm, with a map of the slum on the screen. He pinpointed
    on the map where the house was, clicked on it, and a GO Code appeared. He read
    the number out to another employee, who wrote it neatly on the door of the home,
    which had once been, by all appearances, the entrance to a ladies’ room.

    length of my forearm – above the doors. (Soon after I left Kolkata, Google partnered
    with Addressing the Unaddressed, and together, they are now using the company’s
    [Plus Codes](https://plus.codes/) addressing system.) It was hard to see what
    an address could possibly do for most of these people. If nothing else, I thought,
    it would make the feel included.

- en: Inclusion is one of the secret weapons of street addresses. Employees at the
    World Bank soon found that addresses were helping to empower the people who lived
    there by helping them to feel a part of society. This is particularly true in
    slum areas. “A citizen is not an anonymous entity lost in the urban jungle and
    known only by his relatives and co-workers; he has an established identity,” a
    group of experts wrote in a book on street addressing. Citizens should have a
    way to “reach and be reached by associations and government agencies,” and to
    be reached by fellow citizens, even ones they didn’t know before. In other words,
    without an address, you are limited to communicating only with people who know
    you. And it’s often people who don’t know you who can most help you.

- en: This sense of civic identity is particularly important in slum areas, where
    people are, by definition, living on the edge of society. It’s also why there’s
    reason to be skeptical of organisations like Addressing the Unaddressed. Rather
    than incorporating the slums into the existing address system in Kolkata, Addressing
    the Unaddressed was assigning a new kind of address, reserved for the slums alone.
    They weren’t incorporating the slums into the rest of the city; you might argue
    they were doing the opposite.

- en: In a way, I agree with that critique. It would be so much better if the address
    system could unite these two Kolkatas living side by side. I liked the thought
    that the people in the slums would belong to the rest of the city, not just to
    each other. But, as I write, the city government seems unwilling or unable to
    include them. So, for now, they have Subhashis.

    coexisted with the towering, smoking dump, Subhashis told me that Bhagar’s main
    problem was that it didn’t have proper communication with the rest of the city.
    I didn’t understand what he meant until l realised that he was probably using
    the word “communication” where I would have said “transportation”.

    the Hooghly River, including a kind of open-air vehicle like the ones you ride
    on in airports. An estimated 150,000 pedestrians (and 100,000 cars) cross the
    cantilever bridge each day, and the steel joints are wearing out, in part because
    of the collective tobacco-like gutka chewed and spat on the bridge. We were lucky
    to be riding in a taxi most of the way, but we still had to get out and walk when
    it refused to take us any closer to the slum.

    cut off physically from the rest of Kolkata, but the rest of the world was also
    cut off from it. Nobody besides the dump truck drivers ever had to see how its
    residents lived. Addresses, it seemed, might offer one way to tell them.
