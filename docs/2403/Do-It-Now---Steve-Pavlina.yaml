- en: In order to accomplish this goal, I determined I’d have to take 30-40 units
    per semester, when the average student took 12-15 units. It became immediately
    obvious that I’d have to manage my time extremely well if I wanted to pull this
    off. I began reading everything I could find on time management and putting what
    I learned into practice. I accomplished my goal by graduating with two Bachelor
    of Science degrees (computer science and mathematics) in just three semesters
    without attending summer school. I slept seven to eight hours a night, took care
    of my routine chores (shopping, cooking, etc), had a social life, and exercised
    for 30 minutes every morning. In my final semester, I even held a full time job
    (40 hours a week) as a game programmer and served as the Vice Chair of the local
    Association of Computing Machinery (ACM) chapter while taking 37 units of mostly
    senior-level computer science and math courses. My classmates would add up all
    the hours they expected each task to take and concluded that my weeks must have
    consisted of about 250 hours. I graduated with a 3.9 GPA and also received a special
    award given to the top computer science student each year. One of my professors
    later told me that they had an easy time selecting the award recipient once it
    became clear to them what I was doing.

    up signs in every room that said “$5,000 / month.” That was my monthly business
    income goal at the time. Because I knew exactly what I wanted, I achieved that
    goal within a few weeks. I continued setting specific income goals, even amidst
    occasional setbacks, and I found this process very effective. It wasn’t just that
    it helped me focus on what I wanted — perhaps even more important is that it made
    it easy for me to disregard those things that weren’t on the path to my goal.
    For example, if you set a goal to earn $10,000/month, this can help you stop doing

    plan, thereby missing the opportunity, or do you stop and go after the opportunity,
    thereby throwing yourself off schedule? This is where you have to stop and reconnect
    with your goals to decide which is the better course. No plan should be followed
    blindly. As soon as you gain new knowledge that could invalidate the plan, you
    must exercise integrity in the moment of choice. Sometimes you can reach your
    goals faster by taking advantage of shortcuts that arise unexpectedly. Other times
    you should stick to your original plans and avoid minor distractions that would

    a task only yields 20% of the value of that task. In college I was ruthless in
    my application of this principle. Some weeks I ditched as many as 40% of my classes
    because sitting through a lecture was often not the most effective way for me
    to learn. And I already noted that I would simply refuse to do an assignment if
    I determined it was not worth my time. There was one math class that I only showed
    up to twice because I could learn from the text book much more quickly than from
    the lectures. I only showed up for the midterm and final. I would pop my head
    in at the beginning of each class to drop off my homework and then again at the
    end of each class to write down the next assignment. I actually got the highest
    grade in that class, but the teacher probably had no idea who I was. The other
    students were playing by the rules, not realizing they were free to make their

    semester, I would have several tests and projects due just about every week. I
    had no time to study outside of class because most of that time was used for my
    job. So I simply had to learn everything the first time it came up. If a teacher
    wrote out something on the board, I would memorize it then and there; I couldn’t
    afford to learn things later and risk falling behind. During my slower classes,
    I would do homework, work out algorithms for my programming job, or refine my

    I quickly learned that I needed to make a conscious effort to reinforce my enthusiasm
    on a daily basis. I always had my Walkman cassette player with me (there were
    no portable MP3 players back then), and while walking from one class to the next,
    I would listen to time management and motivational tapes. I also listened to them
    while jogging every morning. I kept my motivation level high by reinforcing my
    enthusiasm almost hourly. Even though I was being told by others that I would
    surely fail, these tapes were the stronger influence because I never went more
    than a few hours without plugging back in.

    even enjoy the normally tedious parts of your work. I’ve always found that whenever
    I want to take my business to a new level, I must take my thoughts to a new level
    first. When your thinking changes, then your actions will change, and your results
    will follow. Unless you’re a naturally hyper person, your enthusiasm is going
    to need daily reinforcement. I recommend either listening to motivational tapes
    or reading inspiring books or articles for at least fifteen minutes every day.
    Whenever I’ve stopped doing this, I’ve found that self-doubt always returns, and
    my productivity drops off. It’s truly amazing how constantly feeding your mind
    with positive material can maintain your enthusiasm indefinitely. And if you multitask,
    you can get this benefit without investing any extra time into it.

    vegetarian, and I noticed a decent boost in my energy and especially in my ability
    to concentrate. Four years later (1997) I became a complete vegan (no animal products
    at all), and this yielded an even bigger boost. For details on why I made this
    change, see the article [Why Vegan?](http://stevepavlina.com/blog/2006/09/why-vegan/)

    take significantly more time and energy to digest than plant foods, and when your
    body must divert extra energy to digestion, it means you have less energy available
    for productive mental work. Effectively your work will seem harder while you’re
    digesting meals containing animal products, and you’ll be more inclined to succumb
    to distractions. So if you find yourself having a hard time focusing on mentally
    intense work after lunch, your diet may very well be the culprit. Even Benjamin
    Franklin credited eating lightly at lunch time as being a significant factor in
    his productivity. While his colleagues were sluggish and sleepy in the afternoon,
    he could continue to work productively the rest of the day.

    In college I would go running for 30 minutes first thing every morning before
    breakfast. And of course I’d be listening to motivational and educational tapes
    at the same time. This daily renewal kept me in good physical condition and helped
    me maintain my ideal weight. Furthermore, my class schedule kept me zigzagging
    around campus each day to attend all my classes, and I’d usually have to carry
    a 20-30 pound backpack full of textbooks with me. So even though I spent most
    of my weekdays sitting in classrooms, I still got plenty of daily exercise.

    goods store, and find a dumbbell (or two) that weighs as much as the excess fat
    you’re carrying around. Pick it up and walk around with it for a while. Become
    aware that this is what you’re carrying around with you every day. Imagine how
    much lighter and easier everything would be if you could permanently put that
    weight down. Carrying some extra weight for training purposes is one thing, but
    if that weight is in the form of body fat, then you’re never able to put it down
    and enjoy the benefits of that training. Make a committed decision to shed those
    extra pounds, and enjoy the lifelong benefits of living in a more efficient physical
    vehicle.

    if your life is totally unbalanced. To excel in one area, you can’t let other
    areas lag behind and pull you down. While in college I made an effort to take
    off a full day each week to have a personal life. I exercised, went to parties,
    attended club meetings, played computer games and pool, and even had time to vacation
    in Las Vegas during my final semester. The high turnover rates at the end of “death
    march” projects are caused by a lack of balance. To focus exclusively on your
    primary work at the expense of every other area of your life will only hurt you
    in the long run. Maintain balance by paying attention to every area of your life.
    As you grow in your career, be sure that your personal life grows as well.

    that I never had a girlfriend during this time. While I had plenty of good friends
    (both male and female), got involved in clubs, and enjoyed fun social activities
    every week, I didn’t have enough time to pursue an intimate relationship on top
    of everything else. I remember one instance where a girl I knew was clearly interested
    in pursuing a relationship with me, and she started machinating to spend more
    time alone with me, but I couldn’t take the bait because I just didn’t have time
    for dating. I wouldn’t have made a very good boyfriend at the time.

    even better if I’d stretched it to four or five semesters and allowed myself time
    for a girlfriend. It would have been great to have someone else to share my life
    with, not to mention all the other benefits of intimacy. At least I had plenty
    of time for dating after graduating. Within a few months I had a steady girlfriend,
    and four years later we were married. She and I actually went to the same college
    at the same time, but we never happened to meet while we were there, although
    it turned out we had a few mutual acquaintances.

    your life as juicy as you want it to be. By getting clear about what you want
    and then developing a collection of habits that allow you to efficiently achieve
    your goals, you’ll enjoy a much richer, more fulfilling life than you would otherwise.
    When I look back on my college days from more than a decade in the future, I feel
    a sense of gratitude for the whole experience. I set an enormous stretch goal
    and grew tremendously as a person in the pursuit of that goal. It was one of the
    best times of my life.

    the totality of your life from top to bottom. The reason to master time management
    is to take your good life and transform it into an exceptional one. Time management
    is not about self-sacrifice, self-denial, and doing more of what you dislike.
    It’s about embracing more of what you already love.
