    a goal to see if I could graduate in only three semesters, taking the same classes
    that people would normally take over a four-year period. This article explains
    in detail all the time management techniques I used to successfully pull this
    off.

    per semester, when the average student took 12-15 units. It became immediately
    obvious that I’d have to manage my time extremely well if I wanted to pull this
    off. I began reading everything I could find on time management and putting what
    I learned into practice. I accomplished my goal by graduating with two Bachelor
    of Science degrees (computer science and mathematics) in just three semesters
    without attending summer school. I slept seven to eight hours a night, took care
    of my routine chores (shopping, cooking, etc), had a social life, and exercised
    for 30 minutes every morning. In my final semester, I even held a full time job
    (40 hours a week) as a game programmer and served as the Vice Chair of the local
    Association of Computing Machinery (ACM) chapter while taking 37 units of mostly
    senior-level computer science and math courses. My classmates would add up all
    the hours they expected each task to take and concluded that my weeks must have
    consisted of about 250 hours. I graduated with a 3.9 GPA and also received a special
    award given to the top computer science student each year. One of my professors
    later told me that they had an easy time selecting the award recipient once it
    became clear to them what I was doing.

    of the time I kept quiet about what I was doing, but if someone asked me how many
    units I was taking, I didn’t deny it. I was perhaps the only student at the university

    I used to train, there’s a huge sign on the wall that says, “Your goal is to become
    a black belt.” This helps remind each student why s/he is going through such difficult
    training. When you work for yourself, it’s easy to spend a whole day at your desk
    and accomplish nothing of value. This almost always happens when you aren’t really
    clear about what it is you’re trying to do. In the moments when you regain your
    awareness, ask yourself, “What exactly is it that I’m trying to accomplish here?”
    You must know your destination with as much clarity as possible. Make your goals
    specific, and put them in writing. Your goals must be so clear that it would be
    possible for a stranger to look at your situation objectively and give you an
    absolute “yes” or “no” response as to whether you’ve accomplished each goal or
    not. If you cannot define your destination precisely, how will you know when you’ve
    arrived?

    ninety days from now. What will your monthly income be? How much will you weigh?
    Who will your friends be? Where will you be in your career? What will your relationship

    give you the edge that will keep you on course.

    you must periodically retarget your goals. Reconnect with your clear, written
    goals by re-reading them every morning. Post them on your walls, especially your
    financial goals. Years ago (during the mid-90s), I went around my apartment putting
    up signs in every room that said “$5,000 / month.” That was my monthly business
    income goal at the time. Because I knew exactly what I wanted, I achieved that
    goal within a few weeks. I continued setting specific income goals, even amidst
    occasional setbacks, and I found this process very effective. It wasn’t just that
    it helped me focus on what I wanted — perhaps even more important is that it made
    it easy for me to disregard those things that weren’t on the path to my goal.
    For example, if you set a goal to earn $10,000/month, this can help you stop doing
    those things that will only earn you $5000/month.

    for some external force to provide them with clarity, never realizing that clarity
    is self-created. The universe is waiting on you, not the other way around, and
    it’s going to keep waiting until you finally make up your mind. Waiting for clarity
    is like being a sculptor staring at a piece of marble, waiting for the statue
    within to cast off the unneeded pieces. Do not wait for clarity to spontaneously

    you will take to get there. A typical commercial airplane is off course 90% of
    the time, yet it almost always arrives at its destination because it knows exactly
    where it’s going and makes constant corrections along the way. You cannot know
    the exact path to your goal in advance. I believe that the real purpose of planning
    is simply so that you remain convinced that a possible path exists. We’ve all
    heard the statistic that 80% of new businesses fail in their first five years,
    but a far more interesting statistic is that nearly all of the businesses that
    succeeded did not do so in the original way they had intended. If you look at
    successful businesses that started with business plans, you will commonly find
    that their original plans failed miserably and that they only succeeded by trying
    something else. It is said that no business plan survives contact with the marketplace.
    I like to generalize this to say that no plan survives contact with the real world.

    so good — and then an unforeseen opportunity arises. Do you stick to your original
    plan, thereby missing the opportunity, or do you stop and go after the opportunity,
    thereby throwing yourself off schedule? This is where you have to stop and reconnect
    with your goals to decide which is the better course. No plan should be followed
    blindly. As soon as you gain new knowledge that could invalidate the plan, you
    must exercise integrity in the moment of choice. Sometimes you can reach your

    the context for each new task. Single handling minimizes time lost in task switching.
    In fact, when possible I would batch up my assignments within a certain subject
    area and then do them all at once before switching subjects. So I’d do all my
    math homework in a row until it was all done. Then I’d do all my programming assignments.
    Then I’d do my general education homework. In this manner I would put my brain
    into math-mode, programming-mode, writing-mode, or art-mode and remain in that
    single mode for as long as possible. Secondly, I believe this habit helped me
    remain relaxed and unstressed because my mind wasn’t cluttered with so many to-do
    items. It was always just one thing at a time. I could forget about anything that
    was outside the current context.

    strikeout record at the same time. Those who have the most successes also have
    the most failures. There is nothing wrong or shameful in failing. The only regret
    lies in never making the attempt. So don’t be afraid to experiment in your attempts
    to increase productivity. Sometimes the quickest way to find out if something
    will work is to jump right in and do it. You can always make adjustments along
    the way. It’s the ready-fire-aim approach, and surprisingly, it works a lot better
    than the more common ready-aim-fire approach. The reason is that after you’ve
    “fired” once, you have some actual data with which to adjust your aim. Too many
    people get bogged down in planning and thinking and never get to the point of
    action. How many potentially great ideas have you passed up because you got stuck

    had a string of dismal failures before finally hitting on something that worked,

    failure experiences were an essential contributing factor in their future successes.
    My advice to anyone starting a new business is to begin pumping out products or

    away, make the decision as soon as it comes up. If you can’t make a decision right
    away, set aside a time where you will consider the options and make the decision.
    Pour the bulk of your time into action, not deciding. The state of indecision
    is a major time waster. Don’t spend more than 60 seconds in that state if you
    can avoid it. Make a firm, immediate decision, and move from uncertainty to certainty

    previously acing the class anyway, the only real negative consequence would be
    that I’d end up with an A- in the course instead of an A. I told the professor
    I felt that was a fair trade-off and that I would accept the A-. I didn’t try
    to negotiate with him for special treatment. So my official grade in the class

    meaningful work. When you know for certain that you won’t be interrupted, your
    productivity is much, much higher. When you sit down to work on a particularly
    intense task, dedicate blocks of time to the task during which you will not do
    anything else. I’ve found that a minimum of 90 minutes is ideal for a single block.

    In school I would lock my bedroom door when I needed to work, so my roommates
    would know not to disturb me. While each individual bedroom in the two-bedroom
    dorm suites was designed for two people (four people per suite), I paid a bit
    extra to have a bedroom all to myself. This way I always had my own private room
    to work. When I had time to be social, I’d leave the door open, sometimes playing
    computer games with one of my roommates. If you happen to work in a high interruption
    environment that’s negatively affecting your productivity, change that environment
    at all costs. Some people have told me that giving their boss a copy of this article
    helped convince him/her to take steps to reduce unnecessary interruptions.

    a task, I find that I work best with long, open-ended stretches of uninterrupted
    time. I’ll often allocate a starting time for a task but usually not a specific
    finishing time. Whenever possible I just allow myself to stick with a task as
    long as I can, until I eventually succumb to hunger or other bodily needs. I will
    frequently work 6+ hours straight on a project without taking a break. While frequent
    breaks are often recommended to increase productivity, I feel that suggestion
    may be an artifact of industrial age research on poorly motivated workers and
    not as applicable to high-motivation, purpose-driven creative work. I find it’s
    best for me to maintain momentum until I can barely continue instead of chopping
    a task into smaller chunks where there’s a risk of succumbing to distractions
    along the way.

    to go through college in three semesters. My average weekday involved about seven
    or eight hours of classes. But on Tuesdays during my final semester, I had classes
    back to back from 9am until 10pm. Because I was taking about a dozen classes each
    semester, I would have several tests and projects due just about every week. I
    had no time to study outside of class because most of that time was used for my
    job. So I simply had to learn everything the first time it came up. If a teacher
    wrote out something on the board, I would memorize it then and there; I couldn’t
    afford to learn things later and risk falling behind. During my slower classes,
    I would do homework, work out algorithms for my programming job, or refine my
    schedule. You can probably find numerous opportunities for multitasking. Whenever
    you do something physical, such as driving, cooking, shopping, or walking, keep
    your mind going by listening to audio tapes or reading.

    to work all the time you work. But whereas the previous tip refers to high intensity
    work where you must concentrate all your mental resources in order to do the best
    job you can, this tip addresses low intensity work where you have plenty of capacity
    to do other things at the same time, like standing in line, cooking dinner, flying
    on a plane, or walking from point A to point B. Multitasking shouldn’t be used
    where it will significantly degrade your performance on a crucial task, but it
    should be intelligently used to take advantage of excess capacity. Take real breaks
    when you need them, but don’t waste time in a state of partial effort. It’s more
    efficient to cycle between working flat out and then resting completely.

    routine tasks, listening to fast-paced techno/trance music helps me work a lot
    faster. I don’t exactly know why, but I’m twice as productive when listening to
    really fast music as compared to listening to no music. On the other hand, music
    with vocals is detrimental to my productivity because it’s too distracting. And
    when I really need to focus deeply, I’ll listen to no music at all. Try a simple
    experiment for yourself, and see if certain forms of music can increase your productivity.
    For me the difference was dramatic.

    no portable MP3 players back then), and while walking from one class to the next,
    I would listen to time management and motivational tapes. I also listened to them
    while jogging every morning. I kept my motivation level high by reinforcing my
    enthusiasm almost hourly. Even though I was being told by others that I would
    surely fail, these tapes were the stronger influence because I never went more
    than a few hours without plugging back in.

    I want to take my business to a new level, I must take my thoughts to a new level
    first. When your thinking changes, then your actions will change, and your results
    will follow. Unless you’re a naturally hyper person, your enthusiasm is going
    to need daily reinforcement. I recommend either listening to motivational tapes
    or reading inspiring books or articles for at least fifteen minutes every day.
    Whenever I’ve stopped doing this, I’ve found that self-doubt always returns, and
    my productivity drops off. It’s truly amazing how constantly feeding your mind
    with positive material can maintain your enthusiasm indefinitely. And if you multitask,
    you can get this benefit without investing any extra time into it.

    digesting meals containing animal products, and you’ll be more inclined to succumb

    intense work after lunch, your diet may very well be the culprit. Even Benjamin
