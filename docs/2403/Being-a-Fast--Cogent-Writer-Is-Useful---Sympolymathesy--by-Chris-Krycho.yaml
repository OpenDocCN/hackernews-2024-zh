    velocity doesn’t stop you from working on the right thing. If anything, each of
    these is a force multiplier for the other. Having strong execution skills becomes
    more impactful if you’re good at picking the right problem and vice versa.

- en: One thing writing quickly unlocks for me is the ability to use code review as
    a major teaching tool. At a former job, some colleagues would actually go stalk
    my GitHub to learn from my reviews! That was because those reviews were not just
    “LGTM” or “Please do __ instead.” They came with explanations of why something
    was better, or questions about someone’s goals. I often outlined tradeoffs in
    approach. I would leave links to other relevant materials for them to read.

    writing quickly and clearly for literally decades now. I could review a non-trivial
    change and give it non-trivial feedback in <dash-wrap>20 – 30</dash-wrap> minutes,
    and use that to level up the whole org over time. I say “the whole org” because
    when there was something actually substantive or important in one of those reviews,
    I would sometimes share the review for other people to read. (Only after getting
    permission from the person whose code I was reviewing, though; that’s important!)

    learn how to write quickly and cogently. That means practicing it! But the dividends
    are huge.

    so I always try to pull anything substantive like this back over into my website.
