    their security investments have started to work. So that's one answer. The second
    answer could be that theft has improved because high-risk stores have simply closed.
    This one's trickier. Take Target and Walgreens, which closed stores blaming crime.
    Later, journalists crunched police data and found that companies kept open nearby
    stores that actually reported more crime incidents - just likely were also more
    profitable. So skeptics argue maybe the real answer is that retailers simply overstated
    the problem to begin with.
