    big thing. But scratch the surface, and you''ll often find a familiar story: pump-and-dump
    schemes, outright fraud, and a litany of scams that have left everyday investors
    holding the bag.'

    can innovate responsibly, that it can police itself and protect consumers. Crypto

    But if crypto can’t build with oversight, if it can only succeed when the laws
    don’t apply, it doesn’t deserve to survive.
