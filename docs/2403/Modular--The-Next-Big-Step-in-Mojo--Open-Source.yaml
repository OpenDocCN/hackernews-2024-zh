- en: At Modular, open source is ingrained in our DNA. We firmly believe for Mojo
    to reach its full potential, it must be open source. We have been progressively
    open-sourcing more of Mojo and parts of the MAX platform, and today we‚Äôre thrilled
    to **announce the release of the core modules from the Mojo standard library under
    the Apache 2 license!**

    building Mojo in the open will lead to a better result, because it allows its
    design to be shaped by the feedback from the broader community. We released Mojo
    very early and have been driving steady improvements since May of 2023 (see [the
    changelog](https://docs.modular.com/mojo/changelog)). Building a language and
    its infrastructure is hard work and takes time, and we‚Äôre excited to move from
    sharing our work to collaborating with Mojo developers worldwide.'

    but do not accept contributions. Some provide opaque contribution processes without
    visibility into goals and roadmaps. Some open source and then don‚Äôt actively maintain
    it.

    open source projects like LLVM, Swift, TensorFlow and PyTorch, and we want to
    make sure we do things right. This means not just ‚Äúmaking source code available‚Äù,
    but truly fostering and cultivating a vibrant and engaged **open development community**

    for the standard library, releasing **nightly builds** of the Mojo compiler, providing
    **public CI**, and allowing **external contributions through GitHub pull requests**.
    This is expensive and non-trivial to set up, but in our experience, it's critically
    important to allow the community to scale.

    It contains a **patent grant provision** which provides legal protection to users

    license, and is familiar to many individuals and companies across the industry.

- en: The Apache 2 license is a great start, but our experience with licensing in
    the LLVM project taught us that there are two small issues with it. Some people
    are concerned that the Apache 2 license may not mix well with GPL2 code (e.g.
    the Linux Kernel) and the Apache 2 license requires that you acknowledge use of
    the code in derived projects. We want you to be able to use Mojo **without requiring
    you** to acknowledge Modular or Mojo (though of course, you are welcome to do
    so!) and make it clear that it is fine to mix with GPL2 code. As such, we‚Äôre including
    the [LLVM exceptions](https://spdx.org/licenses/LLVM-exception.html) which were
    specifically designed to address these concerns.

    language and tool projects, and recommend other Mojo open source projects to follow
    the same approach. We have been using this approach for our existing open source
    code, and will continue to release more code with the same approach.

    we've started by open sourcing its core modules. As such, we consider this to
    be an **important starting point**, not an end to our open source journey. We‚Äôll
    similarly evolve and iterate our development and contribution processes as we
    learn together with the community. We'll be opening up a lot more code over time,
    including more of Mojo and parts of the broader MAX platform.

    of the Mojo compiler that corresponds to the library source. This is a massive
    step towards opening development of the Mojo compiler, and allows Mojicians to
    live on the bleeding edge of development if they choose and test against the current
    tree. Over time, we will expand this nightly build to include the entire MAX platform.
