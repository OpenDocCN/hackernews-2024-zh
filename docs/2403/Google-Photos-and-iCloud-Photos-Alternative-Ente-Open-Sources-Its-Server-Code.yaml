    gotten rid of the last proprietary part of its service, the server code, which
    is now also open.

- en: “Secrets keep you sick” – as the saying goes. In terms of giant tech companies
    keeping their “code secret” – i.e., the proprietary model – it often results in
    allowing clearly malicious actors to hack it, but also potentially gives access
    to various official agencies that have no legal business having this access.

    just does not know what’s going on.

    offer to the world, and this one has opted for paid tiers – but also a one-year

    but, as it has been coming to light recently, also governments, the interest of

    internet and the way people use apps and services, in the past made an effort
    to make its app open-source, but the server-side code was still closed.

    fully available to users, other developers, researchers – anyone, to read, audit,
