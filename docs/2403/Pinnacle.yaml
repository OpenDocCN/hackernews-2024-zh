    the App Store.*  *If you experience this, right-click (or CTRL+click) on the .app
    file, select Open, you get the contextual menu to open up the app anyway. It should
    open normally after this.'

- en: Pinnacle is a fun side project I provide free of charge. For this reason I don't
    pay Microsoft and Apple hundreds of dollars in yearly fees to join their developer
    programs. Unfortunately, this means end users can't install free software without
    being nagged.*
