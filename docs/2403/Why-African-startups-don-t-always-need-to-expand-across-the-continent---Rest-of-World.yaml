    expanding into other markets?

- en: When you think of expansion as a Nigerian company, you think of [moving into]
    Ghana, Kenya, and South Africa. But besides the similarities in macroeconomics,
    you’ll realize that products aren’t necessarily replicable in African countries.
    For instance, product adoption is slower in countries like Ghana, and scaling
    a digital savings product in Kenya will be a huge challenge. For a country like
    Egypt, you can’t exactly take a product called PiggyVest and expect adoption.

    So, considering the conditions that made us successful here, our next market could
    be Thailand, Brazil, or Mexico. It could even be Ethiopia or South Africa.

- en: We take bits and pieces from many companies — like Ant Group, after which we
    loosely modeled bits of the PiggyVest ecosystem. We’ve exchanged ideas with the
    CEO of Wealthsimple, a Canadian company. A new feature we are launching soon is
    a product of those exchanges. There’s also Onyx in America. We’ve learned from
    these companies how to diversify our product, build a strong ecosystem network,
    and create great user experiences and financial education.
