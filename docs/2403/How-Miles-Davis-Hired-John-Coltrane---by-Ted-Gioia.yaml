    of Blue](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/592345/3-shades-of-blue-by-james-kaplan/)*.
    Kaplan focuses on three artists who had a transformative impact on jazz: Miles
    Davis, John Coltrane, and Bill Evans.'

    most readable narrative account to date of a milestone moment in American music.

- en: After Johnny Hodges fired him, John Coltrane was back in Philadelphia and spottily
    employed—so spottily that he was without a job for New Year’s Eve of 1954\. And
    so, out of pity, and in gratitude for some musical pointers Coltrane had given
    him, a trumpeter friend named Ted Curson took him along to a gig in Vineland,
    New Jersey. Curson, who went on to have a solid jazz career, remembered the evening
    decades later. “He played ‘Nancy with the Laughing Face,’ I’ll never forget that,”
    he said. “I never heard anything so great, so intense, with so much feeling.”

- en: 'Along with all his other musical strengths, Coltrane had a beautiful way with
    ballads. But his work problems had nothing to do with musical skill. He was a
    heroin addict, with the same set of handicaps that had crippled Miles Davis’s
    career from 1949 to 1954: unreliability and general dishevelment made steady work
    next to impossible. Leading a working band was out of the question. So he picked
    up whatever gigs he could, when he could. One now-and-then job in 1955 was as
    part of an *ad hoc* trio called the Hi-Tones, with the great jazz organist Shirley
    Scott and the youngest Heath brother, Albert (“Tootie”), on drums. All three were
    dead-serious, technically sophisticated players. “We were too musical for certain
    rooms,” Coltrane recalled.'

    on and off for at least a year….We played bebop (including ‘Half Nelson’ and ‘Groovin’
    High’), straight-ahead music….We did rehearse a lot, and we had a lot of arrangements,
    most of them John’s.”

    himself from the great swing drummer Jo Jones—went way back with Coltrane: the
    two had started gigging around town with Percy Heath soon after Coltrane’s discharge
    from the navy. Three years older than the saxophonist, Jones was as different
    from the quiet, serious, monomaniacal Trane as different could be: he was a brilliant,
    highly articulate extrovert, a skilled tap dancer and mimic. He was also a serious
    heroin addict. “Philly Joe Jones was the Babe *Ruth* of junkies,” one longtime
    observer of jazz told me. “I mean, he was *the* junkie. He was *the* cat.”'

  zh: 费城乔——约瑟夫·鲁道夫·琼斯取绰号以区别于伟大的摇摆鼓手乔·琼斯——与科尔特兰关系深厚：两人在科尔特兰从海军退伍后不久便与帕西·希思一起开始在城里表演。琼斯比这位萨克斯风手大三岁，与文静、认真和痴迷音乐的特兰相去甚远：他是一个才华横溢、口齿伶俐的外向型人才，擅长跳踢踏舞和模仿。他也是一个严重的海洛因成瘾者。“费城乔琼斯是海洛因中的贝比·鲁斯，”一位长期观察爵士乐的人告诉我。“我的意思是，他是那个海洛因中的代名词。他就是那个家伙。”
- en: 'Jones and Miles also went back: for a while during Davis’s dark years, the
    two had barnstormed around the Midwest together, Philly Joe going ahead of Miles
    to pick up local sidemen in each city. The results were consistently disappointing.
    Still, it had fed them for a while—fed the monkey on their backs, too.'

  zh: 琼斯和迈尔斯的历史也很久远：在戴维斯的低谷时期，两人曾一起在中西部疯狂巡演，费城乔在每个城市提前为迈尔斯招募本地乐手。结果一直让人失望。但这段经历维持了一段时间——也喂养了他们的背上的恶魔。
- en: 'Miles never made a secret of the fact that Philly Joe was his favorite drummer.
    “He *knew* everything I was going to do, everything I was going to play,” Davis
    said; “he anticipated me, felt what I was thinking.” Jones had a special rim shot
    that he liked to hit immediately after a Miles solo: it became known around jazz
    as a Philly lick. Soon, other musicians began asking their drummers for it, too.
    “I left a lot of space in the music for Philly to fill up,” Miles said. “Philly
    Joe was the kind of drummer that I knew my music had to have. (Even after he left
    I would listen for a little of Philly Joe in all the drummers I had later.)”'

  zh: 迈尔斯从不掩饰乔琼斯是他最喜欢的鼓手这一事实。“他**知道**我要做什么，我要演奏什么，”戴维斯说；“他预测我，感受到我在想什么。”琼斯有一个特别的镶边鼓击，他喜欢在迈尔斯的独奏后立即敲击它：这个动作在爵士乐界被称为费城的节奏。很快，其他音乐家也开始要求他们的鼓手这样做。“我在音乐中留下了很多空间让费城去填充，”迈尔斯说。“费城乔是我音乐中必不可少的鼓手。（即使他离开后，我也会在以后的所有鼓手中听到一点费城乔的影子。）”
- en: 'Miles had tapped Jones to contact Coltrane much as he’d deputized the drummer
    to find sidemen back in the day, only in this case the need was more urgent: Jack
    Whittemore had set up a tour for the Miles Davis Quintet— Baltimore, Detroit,
    then back to New York at Birdland and Café Bohemia—but with Sonny Rollins and
    now John Gilmore out of the picture, the quintet was a quartet.'

  zh: 迈尔斯曾指派琼斯联系科尔特兰以及在早期指派鼓手找到乐手，但这次情况更加紧急：杰克·惠特莫尔为迈尔斯·戴维斯五重奏安排了巡演——巴尔的摩、底特律，然后回到纽约的伯德兰爵士俱乐部和布西米咖啡馆——但由于桑尼·罗林斯和现在约翰·吉尔莫不在画面中，五重奏变成了四重奏。
- en: Coltrane was working at Spider Kelly’s in Philadelphia with the organist Jimmy
    Smith when Philly Joe called and asked if he could come rehearse with the band.
    Recognizing that this could be his shot at the big time, Trane asked Smith for
    a few days off and went to New York, where things did not go well.

- en: John Coltrane would ultimately become a jazz deity, by virtue of his supreme
    technical skills, his ceaseless exploration of the far bounds of the music, and
    the intense spirituality that informed his life and art. But in 1955 he was an
    awkward outsider, as far as possible from any kind of distinction in his field.
    (Even his heroin addiction—desperate, furtive, ashamed—didn’t fit into the cool
    model of jazz culture.) In auditioning for Miles he was virtually coming out from
    hiding, having spent the past decade freelancing around jazz’s seamy outskirts
    as he searched musically; yet even as his playing improved, he gained little faith
    in his own abilities. His ceaseless questing for musical and spiritual enlightenment
    filled him with questions about everything, especially music. And in reencountering
    a newly ascendant Miles Davis, he was coming up against the ultimate non-answerer.

  zh: 约翰·科尔特兰最终成为一位爵士音乐的神灵，凭借他卓越的技术能力、对音乐极限的不懈探索以及深深的精神力量。但在1955年，他是一个笨拙的局外人，远离音乐领域的任何形式的卓越。（即使他的海洛因成瘾——绝望、秘密、羞耻——也不符合爵士文化中冷静的模式。）在试镜迈尔斯时，他几乎是从隐匿中现身，过去十年在爵士音乐的阴暗边缘自由职业，寻找音乐上的探索；然而即使他的演奏有所进步，他对自己能力的信心并不强。他对音乐和精神上的不断追求充满了问题。而在重新遇到处于新兴地位的迈尔斯·戴维斯时，他面对的是一个最终不作回答的人。
- en: “Miles is sort of a strange guy,” he would tell François Postif in 1961\. “He
    doesn’t talk a lot, and he rarely discusses music. You always have the impression
    that he’s in a bad mood, and that he’s not interested in or affected by what other
    people are doing. It’s very hard, in a situation like that, to know exactly what
    you should do….”

- en: 'Two good things quickly became apparent in those September tryouts: that Coltrane’s
    abilities as a player had advanced considerably since that long-ago gig at the
    Audubon Ballroom, and that he knew Miles’s repertoire. What was less good, Davis
    recalled many years later, was that “Trane like to ask all these motherfucking
    questions…about what he should or shouldn’t play. Man, fuck that shit; to me he
    was a professional musician and I have always wanted whoever played with me to
    find their own place in the music. So my silence and evil looks probably turned
    him off.”'

  zh: 在那些九月的试演中很快显现出两件好事：科尔特兰作为一名演奏家的能力自从那场在奥杜邦大厅的久远演出以来显著提升，并且他熟知迈尔斯的曲目。然而，戴维斯多年后回忆说，不那么好的一点是，“特兰总是问这些该死的问题……问我他应该或者不应该演奏什么。我靠，他是个职业音乐家，我一直希望与我共事的人能在音乐中找到自己的位置。所以我的沉默和邪恶的眼神可能让他对我印象不佳。”
- en: 'It was an odd business, this angry aloofness of Miles: on the one hand it seems
    to have been kind of worked up, put on like a vestment of fame and entitlement;
    on the other hand, at first he and Coltrane seem to have genuinely rubbed each
    other the wrong way. After a couple of days of rehearsing, the saxophonist told
    Davis he had to go back to Philadelphia, and left.'

  zh: 这是一桩奇怪的事情，迈尔斯那种愤怒而孤僻的态度：一方面似乎有点被夸大，像是一件名利场上的外衣；另一方面，起初他和科尔特兰确实似乎彼此格格不入。经过几天的排练后，这位萨克斯风手告诉戴维斯他得回费城，然后就离开了。
- en: 'If he had secretly wanted Miles to cut out the unpleasant behavior and hire
    him, Coltrane couldn’t have come up with a better strategy than walking away.
    The first date on the tour, at Baltimore’s Club Las Vegas, was rapidly approaching,
    and Davis still had a hole in the lineup. Coltrane could play, and he knew all
    the tunes: “We practically had to beg him to join the band,” Miles recalled. Coltrane
    joined.'
