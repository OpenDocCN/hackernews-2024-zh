- en: At the heart of the library is a sweeping, nearly 16-meter-tall welcoming forum
    off of which rise stepped terraces that follow smooth, rhythmic curves and a central
    meandering pathway known as the Valley. Serving as the main circulation artery,
    the Valley mirrors the course of the nearby Tonghui river, seamlessly continuing
    the experience of the landscape beyond and linking the north and south entrances
    to lead visitors to all other spaces inside.

- en: The terraced hills rising from the Valley are designed to create a sculpted
    interior landform that serves as the ground, seating, and shelving—an informal
    zone with opportunities to relax, talk, or read quietly, all while staying connected
    to the larger space. Semi-private reading areas and conference rooms are embedded
    into the hills, while book stacks and table seating are set on long, flat areas
    atop. This central open area is fully accessible and incorporates one of the largest
    book Automated Storage and Retrieval Systems (ASRS) in the world
