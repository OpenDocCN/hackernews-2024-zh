- en: Over the last several months, Florida legislators have been quietly working
    to ban — and criminalize — the production and sale of cell-cultivated meat across
    the state, via the introduction of two bills, HB 1071 and SB 1084\. On February
    6, the state's House of Representatives passed SB 1084, which now sits on DeSantis'
    desk awaiting a signature. And if his previous comments are any indication, he
    will be pulling out his pen soon.

    "You need meat, OK. And we''re going to have meat in Florida." DeSantis added,

    cells that does not require the slaughter of animals." In other words, it''s actually
    meat. The development of cell-cultivated meat, the CRS explained, happens in five
    steps: the biopsy of animal cells, cell banking, cell growth, harvesting, and
    food processing. It''s an industry that has heavy oversight in the U.S. by both
    the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the United States Department of Agriculture
    (USDA).'

    the cell-cultivated meat industry, 43 of which are based in the U.S. Of those
    43, just two companies, Good Meat and [Upside Food](https://www.foodandwine.com/lab-grown-meat-usda-approval-cultivated-chicken-7551767),
    have FDA approval in the U.S. While it's still a relatively small industry, it's
    one with major financial backing. According to the CRS, some $3 billion has been
    invested in its growth via private capital, and an additional $5 million has been
    issued via the National Science Foundation in research grants, along with an additional
    $12 million in grants by the USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture.

    fine for selling cultivated meat. Alabama also passed a bill to ban the sale and

    selling cell-cultivated meat there, you could wind up in prison for up to 10 years.

    According to *Fast Company*, both South Korea and Israel have favorable laws toward
    cultivated meat, while the Netherlands (where the first cell-cultivated meat was
    developed in 2013) has pledged $65 million to the industry. China even named cultivated
    meat as part of its five-year plan for national food security, giving other nations
    the proverbial first — and likely biggest — bite out of an industry that's [projected
