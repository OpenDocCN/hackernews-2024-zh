- en: Your personal AI knows you inside-out. It’s local-hosted and securely encrypted
    on your phone, so you’re safe to tell it your secrets. You let it see all your
    texts, emails, photos and videos. It asks your thoughts each day, and you tell
    it what’s on your mind.

    about. It removes all advertising. Nobody but you can influence what it shows.
    Its incentives are fully aligned with yours.

    inanimate objects, has consciousness! It’s been conclusively proven.

    responsible for everything you see. You’re like a new parent, determined to be
    a great one. You spend the next few rapturous days carefully taking care of and
    improving everything you can.

    and how this changes everything. She’s just as excited as you, but then gets confused.
    Her AI showed her different big news — that we’re all living in a computer simulation.
    She spent the past week fully liberated, doing all the things she always wanted
    to do, since it’s all just a game. Her news was just what she needed to hear.
    She grabs you, kisses you, licks your ear, then runs off singing.

    at once - a real information junkie. You ask if he’s heard the big news. He looks
    at you with a blank face and says, “What? No.”

    big smile, and says now he’s so excited to die.
