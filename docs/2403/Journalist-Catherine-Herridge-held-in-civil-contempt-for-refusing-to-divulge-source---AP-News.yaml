    permitted to flout a federal court’s order with impunity,” wrote Cooper, who was
    nominated to the bench by former President Barack Obama.

    violating the Privacy Act — which prohibits the public disclosure of private information
    about individuals without their consent. Chen’s lawsuit says both her personal
    and professional life were upended amid a wave of negative media attention after
    the leak, leading to hate mail and death threats.

    in a contempt order being vacated against a journalist who was being asked to
    name her sources.
