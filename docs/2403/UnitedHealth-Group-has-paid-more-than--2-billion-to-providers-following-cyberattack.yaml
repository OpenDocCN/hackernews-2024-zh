- en: UnitedHealth disclosed nearly a month ago that a cyber threat actor breached
    part of Change Healthcare’s information technology network. The fallout has wreaked
    havoc across the U.S. health-care system. [Change Healthcare](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/02/27/unitedhealths-change-healthcare-cyberattack-outages-continue-pharmacies-deploy-workarounds.html)
    offers e-prescription software and tools for payment management, so the interruptions
    left many providers temporarily unable to fill medications or get reimbursed for
    their services by insurers.
