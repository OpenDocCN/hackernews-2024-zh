    according to a law professor who spoke to *Fortune,* could afford some protections
    to Singapore-based Grace Ocean, which owns the *Dali,* which struck [the bridge](https://fortune.com/2024/03/26/why-bridge-baltimore-maryland-collapsed-francis-scott-key)
    around [1:30 am ET on Tuesday](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/03/26/baltimore-francis-scott-key-collusion/73102358007/)

    Court in Maryland, under the 1851 Limitation of Liability Act, to limit its liability
    to the post-casualty value of the ship,” said [Lawrence Brennan](https://www.fordham.edu/school-of-law/faculty/directory/adjunct/lawrence-b-brennan/),
    a professor of admiralty and international maritime law at Fordham University
    School of Law in New York.

- en: If Grace Ocean seeks such protections, Brennan explained, the company would
    need to file a petition in federal court and post a bond equivalent to the firm’s
    valuation of the ship. If the judge approves the petition, the owners of the *Dali*
    would only have to pay an amount equal to what the ship is valued at—which is
    calculated after the crash. Such a sum would be billions less than actual damages.

    and not steel ships. So it has lots of issues, but there’s a long history [of
    cases] and it’s still valid law in the United States.”

    a pretrial settlement, although Grace Ocean could face additional liabilities
    under federal admiralty and environmental laws tied to other damages and cleaning
    up pollution in the harbor. (Grace Ocean couldn’t be immediately reached for comment.)

    famous maritime catastrophe did make it to court: After the sinking of the *Titanic*
    in 1912, Oceanic Steam Navigator, which owned the ship, [requested the protections](https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/ll/usrep/usrep233/usrep233718/usrep233718.pdf) of
    the 1851 law. Although the courts noted that Britain’s regulations were different
    than those of the U.S., the Second Circuit of the Courts of Appeals granted the
    protections.'

    there will be more scrutiny on a June 2023 inspection by Tokyo MoU while the ship
    was docked in San Antonio, Chile, which discovered deficiencies in the [“propulsion
    and auxiliary machinery.”](https://www.equasis.org/EquasisWeb/restricted/ShipInspection?fs=DetailsPSC)
    However, a standard examination by the Coast Guard in September didn’t mention
    those deficiencies.

    average](https://psabdp.com/psa-bdp-blog/what-is-general-average-and-what-does-it-mean-for-your-cargo)—the
    principle that any losses are shared among all stakeholders, such as shippers,
    cargo providers, et cetera—has been applied. Brennan said it’s unlikely such a
    scenario unfolds with the *Dali* because of the ship’s apparent mechanical problems,
    meaning the cargo providers could push for stronger claims.

    of the ship,” Brennan added. “If they don’t do that, they’re not going to recover
    either.”
