    prompted to do so**. Even if they are taught how to set up automatic backups on

    months' worth of collective world building. The save file that contained all that
    information disappeared during an update (we looked, and looked some more), and
    Microsoft's own file syncing for Minecraft hadn't worked properly. This was an
    upsetting experience for my child, who bore the responsibility of hosting the
    world and all the work put into it by friends as well; it was a hard lesson about
    the importance of making backups.

- en: A backup is a copy of a save file that is stored on a different device. This
    could be, for example, a USB drive, or another computer. [Cloud storage](/what-is-the-cloud/)
    is essentially storing a file on another computer (over the Internet), usually
    one managed by the company that provides the storage. The benefit of keeping backups
    of files is that if a specific device is lost or if it breaks, your data is kept
    safe.

    to show you their work flow. I have done this with all my children, and, when
    I was a high school teacher, with many of my students. It takes time, but because
    every person has their own system of organising files, sitting with them is the
    only way.
  id: totrans-split-23

- en: You might start by asking them to show you where they store school work. While
    this is now often done on online school management systems (which usually means
    the files are safe), some school projects might be created on your child's laptop,
    for example. Seeing their specific school-related workflow can give you some insight
    in how your child sees the operating system and how they handle data and files
    in general. You may have to brace yourself and look hard for method in the madness.

    possibility is that they might be saving files to the operating system''s dedicated
    folders (Documents, Pictures, Videos, etc.) on the local hard drive. And a third
    possibility is that your child just saves files where ever each individual application
    saves work by default. In that case, it might be best to open a specific project,
    select ''save as'' and see where that application saves work.'

    only. You may have agreed to some form of automated backup, for example, to Microsoft's

    on a new device.

    to Dropbox's own computers, where ever in the world they may be.

    sync that folder** to your cloud provider's backup service. When create sub-folders
    within that one synced master folder (School Work, Art, Game Saves, etc.) everything
    in those sub-folders will be backed up too. You will need to check once in a while
    your child is using the special folder.

    computer. This will show up on the left side of the file manager. It is usually
    safer to store your data on a second drive, and not on the hard drive that runs
    the operating system. Systems, like Windows, can crash and this can lead to personal
    data being wiped. Should you experience such a crash, a new install of the operating
    system will automatically recognise the extra physical data drive, with all your
    data intact. **A USB stick can function like an extra data drive too**.

    you know how, you could automate syncing to a second hard drive, or you can just
    buy a USB storage device and make a copy of all the user created data once a month.
    You could set a reminder to do this on your calendar.

    dedicated computer, and this can be an older PC with the older HDD type of drive.
