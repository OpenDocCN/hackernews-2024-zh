- en: There’s a form of OKRs described in Measure What Matters which is often repeated
    in blog posts about OKRs and in the pulpy documentation found in the documentation
    OKR tool vendors publish. OKRs are not a formalised method so as I’ve written
    before, OKR documentation includes significant variation causing confusion. The
    positive side of this is there’s lots of experimentation on how to improve.

    by each team. Whilst the Objectives are often described as an outcome, the examples
    of OKRs that are provided usually indicate that what is meant by ‘Outcome’ is
    very loose and could mean ‘activity’, ‘output’ and very occasionally an actual
    outcome.

    of cascading OKRs by using the key results of higher up in the organisation to
    be as the objectives of the next level down and so on for however many levels
    of hierarchy exist. I get the appeal, it feels like a neat path for alignment.
    It just stands up to more than a few moments of thought on what this actually
    translates to and whether that is valuable for the organisation.

    Process from the Theory of Constraints body of knowledge. It’s a simple-to-apply
    method for describing outcomes (often a tough challenge for those without practice)
    that’s easier to get the knack of.

    but you still occasionally see bad examples which mix the goal and how it’s measured.

  id: totrans-split-21

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A narrower approach which in my experience leads to more useful key results
    which are more likely to indicate real progress towards the goal is to think of
    key results as being symptomatic of achieving the objective or put another way,
    as evidence of making progress towards the goal. This again will suggest that
    putting activities as a key result such as completing some work or building something
    are bad key results and have the causal influence reversed.

    They do this to provide their teams with more context and reduce the feeling of
    starting from a blank slate each quarter which can translate to lots of time wasted
    and less continuity. More sophisticated performance measurement frameworks such
    as PuMP use this approach (and many other improvements on how OKRs are typically
    implemented) and it’s an exceptional complement to any OKR implementation.

    your OKRs”- work on being clear on the context. This work can be living documents
    which evolve as you learn through doing and be reflected in artefacts such as
    your Purpose, Vision, Strategy and the persistent model of relationships between
    enduring goals for your organisation which help articulate the rationale for why
    you believe achieving these will help realise your purpose.

    2-5 for any given period. In my experience, an organisation’s ability to focus
    and still be effective can improve over time but to have success with OKRs, start
    as simple as possible. This can also inform how an organisation might adopt OKRs.
    Don’t start with all teams and lots of goals at different levels of resolution.
    You might evolve to that over time as you build up organisational competencies
    with OKRs but you are unlikely to have those competencies when you start.

    and ways to instil OKRs as a practice into your organisation. I often suggest
    leaders ‘dogfood’ OKRs themselves and know what is involved before introducing
    OKRs more broadly. Important to know what is being signed up for and the level
    of commitment required.
  id: totrans-split-26

- en: Defining at least two OKRs is often the suggestion and I believe a great reason
    for this is to help think about trade-offs within your organisation. There’s always
    more than one important thing to trade off against or reconcile with organisations
    of any size and using OKRs to help make these explicit is a great benefit of OKRs.

- en: There are many examples online and in Measure What Matters which show how OKRs
    could cascade from the top of an organisation through the ‘levels’ of the organisation.
    A common approach suggested is for the key results of a higher-level objective
    to become an objective for a lower level. Many of these examples are contrived,
    such as the oft-cited OKRs for an American Football team.

    with his central argument being the time it takes. He suggests a better way for
    all teams to set goals in parallel, allowing for bi-directional influence, for
    instance, issues which may be important to the organisation but at the coalface
    get the opportunity to be highlighted and inform the strategy.

    - an approach that can be done in parallel in a much more compressed amount of
    time. Paired with a persistent model the degree of alignment with the organisation’s
    purpose and strategic direction remains strong.

    the organisation as objectives can remain focused on outcomes at all levels rather
    than being converted to output measures after the leadership level which is the
    result of the cascading approach.

    to co-exist with the work that typically helps the organisation function at its
    desired level of performance. This is often described as operational work or Business
    As Usual (BAU). Operational work is important, it’s usually about the organisation
    delivering the products and services it provides. BAU is one of those minimising
    ways of describing work so it’s not a term I like to use.

    because they also involve metrics, they sometimes look like key results. KPIs
    typically define a threshold and whilst the values of a given KPI fall within
    this range they will be considered healthy.
  id: totrans-split-33
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: OKRs, given they typically focus on change are usually leading indicators focused
    on shorter time windows and KPIs, which represent the health of what the organisation
    seeks to sustain, are usually lagging indicators focused on longer timeframes.
  id: totrans-split-34
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: With persistent models or driver trees or similar relationships which also show
    the relationships between metrics, you can reconcile these two types of measurement.
    You can think of the change an OKR is helping you achieve as moving a KPI to a
    new, better threshold. You can also use OKRs for managing corrective actions when
    a KPI has fallen below the threshold that has been set.
