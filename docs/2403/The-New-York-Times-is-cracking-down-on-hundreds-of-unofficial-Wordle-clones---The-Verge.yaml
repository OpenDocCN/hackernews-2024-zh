- en: Hundreds of games inspired by *Wordle*, the popular web-based word puzzle, are
    at risk of being deleted due to copyright takedowns issued by *The New York Times*.
    [As reported by *404 Media*](https://www.404media.co/nytimes-files-copyright-takedowns-against-hundreds-of-wordle-clones/),
    *The* *New York Times* — which purchased *Wordle* back in 2022 — has filed several
    DMCA notices over *Wordle* clones created by GitHub coders, citing its ownership
    over the *Wordle* name and copyrighted gameplay including 5x6 tile layout and
    gray, yellow, and green color scheme.

    and [Bosnian-language](https://github.com/github/dmca/blob/fdeb00c4425e23c3a8115c297bc54d44151c4289/2024/01/2024-01-24-nytimes.md?ref=404media.co)
    versions of the game. Additional requests were filed this week against [*Wirdle*](https://www.shetnews.co.uk/2024/03/07/shetland-dialect-version-wordle-taken/)
    — a variant created by dialect group I Hear Dee in 2022 to promote the Shaetlan
    language — and *Reactle*, an open-source *Wordle* clone built using React, TypeScript,
    and Tailwind. It was developed prior to the *Times’* purchase of the game, according
    to its developer, Chase Wackerfuss.

    allowing developers to build upon it to create a wide variety of *Wordle*-inspired
    games that use different languages, themes, and visual styles, some of which *404
    Media* says are “substantially different” from *Wordle*. The DMCA notice against
    *Reactle* also targets all of these games forked from the original *Reactle* code
    on GitHub, alleging that spinoffs containing the *Wordle* name have been made
    in “bad faith” and that “gameplay is copied exactly” in the *Reactle* repository.
    Numerous developers commenting on a [Hacker News thread](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39618193)
    also claim to have been targeted with DMCA takedowns.

- en: The Times has no issue with individuals creating similar word games that do
    not infringe The Times’s “Wordle” trademarks or copyrighted gameplay. The Times
    took action against a GitHub user and others who shared his code to defend its
    intellectual property rights in Wordle. The user created a “Wordle clone” project
    that instructed others how to create a knock-off version of The Times’s Wordle
    game featuring many of the same copyrighted elements. As a result, hundreds of
    websites began popping up with knock-off “Wordle” games that used The Times’s
    “Wordle” trademark and copyrighted gameplay without authorization or permission.

    it shares with *Lingo*, a 1980s game show that centered on players guessing five-letter
    words, with a grid that changes color based on accuracy.
