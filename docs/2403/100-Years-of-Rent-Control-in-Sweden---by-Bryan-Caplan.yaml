    of pause between the First and Second World War. It is also a country that has
    the world’s oldest statistical data on population (from 1686!) and excellent statistical
    data on population and housing today. This offers a unique opportunity to look
    back at history through the lens of data and see what it tells us about the effects
    of such an extensive period of rent control.

- en: Much has been written about rent control over the years. Proponents argue that
    it strengthens the rights of tenants so that the landlords cannot drive them out
    by unreasonable rents while critics argue that it reduces the supply of rental
    apartments and creates housing shortages. Sweden, like the rest of Europe, experienced
    a period of rapid urbanization during the 19^(th) century, especially in its second
    half. There were only three major cities with more than 10 000 inhabitants in
    1800 but this number grew to twenty-two by 1900.

- en: While rental houses existed in the large cities (like Gothenburg and Stockholm)
    prior to the 19^(th) century, they were rare elsewhere. For hundreds of years,
    owners of land had rented their sheds and stables for farmworkers during the planting
    and sowing seasons and this was done in a laissez-faire manner. In fact, there
    was only a single nationwide law that governed rental contracts from 1734 and
    it regulated two dates during the year when a contract could be terminated or
    renegotiated (April and October).

    height of buildings and maximum width of streets. Most buildings in the past were
    made from timber and such regulations were meant to prevent local fires from spreading
    and destroying the entire city (think of the Great London Fire in 1666 or the
    Great Chicago Fire in 1871).

    process and had already experienced some of its negative effects, such as overcrowded
    apartments and serious health epidemics. By 1848, they introduced the Public Health
    Act to improve living conditions in the cities and these ideas were picked up
    and promoted by Swedish intellectuals. It led His Majesty the King to sign off
    on the first national building code in 1874\. It regulated many different aspects
    of city building, from how the property should be designed to how wide the streets
    must be. One important regulation was the height of buildings that were limited
    to five floors.[[1]](#_ftn1) An interesting fact is that the King could grant
    a special exemption why the sixth floor came to be known as the King’s floor.

    with the advent of the first financial institutions, the ability to finance construction
    with loans led to a series of building booms. The concept of “speculative construction”
    was born where housing became a good to invest in and trade, like spices from
    the East. Coupled with the provisions in the building code, this period saw the
    growth of the so called “tenement barracks”. The historian Ohlmarks gives us a
    glimpse of how it was to live in them:'

    permeated the country and many had emigrated. Between 1850 and 1900, the net emigration
    from Sweden amounted to a fifth of the total population. The Social Democratic
    Workers’ Party was founded in 1889 and ideas of workers’ rights begun to take
    hold.

    how to increase the rate of construction so that more people could own their homes.
    The committee’s recommendations were, among other things, to set up a governmental
    loan policy for construction of housing that came to be known as “homeowner loans.”[[3]](#_ftn3)
    Architectural historian Eva Eriksson comments on this in her work on the birth
    of the modern city: “home ownership was obviously seen by many in the establishment
    as a way to channel the social tension (…) To strengthen the feeling of home and
    motherland, which should reduce the tendency to emigrate.”[^([4])](#_ftn4) Many
    of the founders of “grassroot” homeowner associations were government officials
    of what we would today consider a centre-right government.'

    Koch[^([6])](#_ftn6) wrote about the living conditions of workers (which at least
    in part) prompted the government to conduct the first ever nationwide housing
    census in 1912\. One major goal was to assess the living conditions, not the least
    the extent of so called “over crowdedness”.

    Europe and construction halted due to inflated costs and high interest rates.
    At the same time, urbanization continued. Worried that rents would soar and lead
    to even more dissatisfaction (and no doubt, worried that power would shift even
    more to the new Socialist Party), the government passed the first ever nationwide
    rent control law in 1917\. It prohibited “unreasonable” increases of rent.

    of slums in cities and urban centres and steps that could be taken to resolve
    the poor living conditions.”[[7]](#_ftn7) Their results came 17 years later in
    a 500+ page report. Sweden should continue the policy of subsides for construction
    of single-family houses (the “homeowner loans” mentioned earlier) and construction
    of multi-family houses should be left to companies “without specific profit motives”,
    under the supervision of the municipalities.

    seemed like a repeat of what had happened twenty-five years earlier, except the
    law was expanded with a maximum rent limit as well as even stronger protections
    for tenants. The subsidized loan program was expanded as well, with “addition
    loans” that were meant to cover the additional war-time costs of construction.
    The number of apartments built with loan subsidies was only 5% in 1939 but increased
    to almost 100% in 1942.[[8]](#_ftn8)

    War II. Even though production returned to 1930s levels, demand continued to surpass
    supply until another governmental investigation was launched in 1959 to deal with
    the housing problem once and for all. It led to what is today known in Sweden
    as the “Million program”, where the goal was to build a million apartments in
    ten years. Note, however, that the trend of lower shares of rental apartments
    (Figure 2) continued almost uninterrupted during this period.

- en: This brings us to the roots of more recent history. The new value-based rent
    law was introduced in 1969 and was modified in 1978 to allow for a special “negotiation
    clause”. It allowed the landlord to negotiate general rent increases with tenants
    instead and was seen as a softer version of rent control (some even claim today
    that Sweden doesn’t have rent control). In practice, the negotiations are done
    on a national level between the Tenants’ Union and the Landlord Association. Any
    disagreements are to be resolved by the housing court that would look at rent
    levels for similar apartments in similar locations.

    to be exempt from the value-based system for fifteen years, after which the value-based
    system would begin to apply. Figure 4 shows how the rent levels differ between
    new and average rental apartments from 2016-2022.

    lesson. Even after 70 years of continuous rent control in various forms, the rental
    housing market in Sweden seems to be a big mess.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The other story is more one of success. There was a housing shortage after the
    First World War but it took the market less than a decade to recover. The housing
    census of 1933 shows that the vacancy numbers had returned to normal levels (2-3%)
    for a balanced housing market. Perhaps it’s time for Sweden and the rest of the
    world to try it again?
