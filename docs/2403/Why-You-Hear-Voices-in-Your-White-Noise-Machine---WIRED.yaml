    Mine offers several types of noise: white, pink, green, and brown. I’ve noticed
    something strange, though. After about 30 minutes of the noise pumping into my
    head, I start to hear things. Sometimes it’s music, like a full orchestral score.
    Other times it’s people having a conversation just out of the range where I’d
    hear actual words. Occasionally, it sounds like my husband playing a video game.'

    night. I try to find it. I turn off the white noise and listen intently. Do I
    need my husband to turn the TV down? Should I text the neighbors to see if they’re
    alright? Is there, in fact, an entire orchestra playing a score in the alley below
    my window?

    hearing things that aren’t there is referred to in the psych biz as auditory pareidolia,
    or auditory hallucinations, and is a hallmark of schizophrenia—and some experts
    say it requires a psychological check-up.

    disorders, individuals should likely be evaluated by a mental health professional
    if they are hearing these hallucinations,” advises [Ruth Reisman](https://www.drruthreisman.com/),
    an audiologist who focuses on rehabilitation with hearing technology. She also
    notes that research is divided on the topic, with some studies saying noise produces
    hallucinations and some saying it doesn’t.

    would have picked up on any schizophrenic tendencies I may have. I’m a lot of
    things, but schizophrenic is not one of them. I’m just … hearing weird noises
    in fuzzy sounds.

    out there’s a perfectly normal reason you may hear random sounds in white noise
    (or any other continuous noise). It’s still called [auditory pareidolia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareidolia),
    but it’s on the pattern-matching end of the spectrum instead of the psychosis
    end. Simply put, your brain is trying to figure out what it’s hearing, so it’s
    filling in the gaps of the noise you’re listening to with a common sound.

    CEO of the [Center for Hearing Loss Help](https://hearinglosshelp.com/). “Everything
    I say, all my words, all the sounds, are in your brain, in your database. And
    as each sound comes in, your brain looks through its database to see if it's got
    the same pattern of sound. If it does, it says, oh, I recognize that word.”

    still recognize some letters and some sounds, and your mind will fill in the spaces
    in order to replicate a pattern you already know.

    brown, pink, green, or otherwise, is based on an algorithm or a code. It’s not
    truly random—so you’ll get a little while of what seems like random noise, and
    then the sounds repeat. On the surface, it probably doesn’t seem like it. But
    your brain recognizes the pattern and tries to make sense of it, which leads to
    hearing noises that aren’t actually there.
