- en: We started Deepnote to help data teams solve the hardest problems. We don’t
    just need better algorithms, bigger data sets, and more computing power. We need
    tools that help us explore, collaborate, and share. These tools don’t exist yet.
    **We need to invent them first.**

- en: Data work is as much a scientific and creative process as it is an engineering
    one. It involves working together, failing, learning, and going back to the drawing
    board. [Data professionals are explorers](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8103446).
    To make projects successful, we need tools that are both powerful and easy to
    use. Tools that help us collaborate and share our work in an engaging way. Tools
    that make working with data fun again.
