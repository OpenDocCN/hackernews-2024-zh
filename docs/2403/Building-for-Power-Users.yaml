    purpose, like ordering food or checking on the status of a financial transfer.
    Some are used all the time, but as a cure for boredom and a substitute for not
    knowing what to do. And then there are apps for power users, where the typical
    user is constantly engaged with the product and uses it not just as a tool for
    working but as a tool of thought. These are an important category, where many
    of the rules of usability have to be tweaked or even reversed.

- en: 'Building a tool like this means thinking very seriously about what users are
    trying to accomplish, and modeling the behavior of the most sophisticated user
    in a detailed way. This is in contrast to many other applications where the default
    goal is discoverability. Spotify is not designed for someone who wants to DJ a
    one-of-a-kind event with an esoteric theme, do a comparative analysis of how various
    conductors handle a particularly tricky passage by Mahler, or track the popularity
    over time of a particular hip-hop sample. No, it''s a simpler job-to-be-done:
    I''m about to head to work / go work out / go crazy because my kids are demanding
    a novelty song that may not actually exist, so give me some good background listening.
    For more transactional apps, the task is simpler, but the meta-task is harder.
    If someone is logging into their HR portal and opening one of the half-dozen customer
    loyalty apps they have installed on their phone, they might have any of half a
    dozen tasks in mind, but they also haven''t looked at the app in question in weeks
    or months, so the app needs to be re-learned. Apps like this can put a very low
    premium on keeping their experience consistent, simply because no one will notice
    if it changes. Instead, they have to put a high premium on discoverability, and
    can default to pretending that every user is opening the app for the first time.
    They don''t and can''t really care about extensibility, composability, and the
    like—few use cases involve intermittently doing something complicated within an
    app that isn''t regularly used.'

  zh: 构建这样的工具意味着非常认真地思考用户试图完成什么，并且以详细的方式模拟最复杂用户的行为。这与许多其他应用形成鲜明对比，这些应用的默认目标是可发现性。Spotify并不是为那些想在异国情调的主题下DJ、做马勒特别棘手乐段的比较分析，或者追踪某一特定嘻哈采样的流行程度的人设计的。不，它是一个更简单的工作任务：我要去上班/去锻炼/快要疯掉了，因为我的孩子们要求一首可能实际上并不存在的新奇歌曲，所以给我一些好听的背景音乐。对于更具交易性的应用程序来说，任务更简单，但元任务更难。如果有人登录他们的人力资源门户并打开手机上安装的半打客户忠诚度应用程序之一，他们可能有半打不同的任务在心中，但他们也可能已经几周或几个月没有查看相关应用了，因此应用程序需要重新学习。这类应用程序可能会非常低地重视保持其体验一致，因为如果它发生变化，没有人会注意到。相反，它们必须高度重视可发现性，并可以默认地假设每个用户都是第一次打开该应用程序。它们实际上不会也无法关心可扩展性、可组合性等问题——很少有用例涉及在定期不使用的应用程序中偶尔做一些复杂的事情。
- en: The downside to maximizing power is that it necessarily trades off discoverability.
    The faster it is for an experienced user to do anything—whether it's a sysadmin
    cross-referencing memory consumption and CPU usage over time check in a single
    quick shell script, or a Bloomberg user whipping up a comparison between implied
    volatility in copper and realized volatility in the Chilean peso in a handful
    of keystrokes—building a product that enables it means getting out of the user's
    way, and that means assuming they know what they're doing or can quickly figure
    it out. If the median user-hour for a product is from someone who has used the
    product for thousands of hours before, a "tips" feature highlighting things they’ve
    used for years is just going to annoy them.

    some unique economics. For one thing, they tend to be valuable complements to
    the work of people who are already quite economically valuable. For a while in

    per license](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gosling_Emacs?ref=thediff.co), or,
    at the low end, [about 1% of what programmers in the Bay Area made in a typical

- en: 'There are stocks that go up 40x in half a decade, and there are large-cap companies,
    but the combination is uncommon. SuperMicro, though, traded at $20 in early 2019
    and closed Friday at $803 (and that was after a 20% drop). The *Financial Times*
    has [an overview of the business](https://www.ft.com/content/5b3ff851-acd9-4588-9ed9-edef8164fbcc?ref=thediff.co)
    ($): they make servers, particularly high-performance servers for AI computing.
    This business has been growing quite fast (though they don''t serve the really
    big AI deployments by the hyperscalers; SuperMicro sells to smaller customers,
    and its gross margins are those of a semi-commoditized business, not one with
    enduring pricing power. There is, of course, plenty of money to be made owning
    commoditized businesses at times of extreme supply/demand imbalance. But there''s
    another supply/demand imbalance to think about: [options referencing 36% of their
    shares outstanding expired on Friday, and if the usual option-buying pattern of
    retail investors holds, many of these options moved into the money, forcing options
    dealers to buy more shares to hedge](https://www.fabricatedknowledge.com/p/wtf-is-going-on-at-supermicro-smci?ref=thediff.co).
    This is the kind of thing that can lead to wild volatility, but it requires a
    continuous flow of new retail money just to maintain a share price driven by options
    demand, not to mention increase it.'

  zh: 有些股票在半个十年里增长了40倍，也有大型市值公司，但二者结合在一起并不常见。然而，SuperMicro在2019年初以20美元的价格交易，上周五收盘价为803美元（即使是在下跌20%之后）。*《金融时报》*有[关于这家企业的概述](https://www.ft.com/content/5b3ff851-acd9-4588-9ed9-edef8164fbcc?ref=thediff.co)（$）：它们生产服务器，特别是用于AI计算的高性能服务器。这个业务增长相当迅速（尽管它们不为超大规模AI部署提供服务；SuperMicro销售给规模较小的客户，其毛利润率属于半商品化业务，而不是具有持久定价能力的业务。当然，在供需极度失衡时，拥有商品化业务可以赚取丰厚的利润。但还有另一种供需失衡需要考虑：[参考36%流通股份的期权在上周五到期，如果零售投资者通常的期权购买模式持续，其中许多期权已进入实值，迫使期权交易商购买更多股份进行对冲](https://www.fabricatedknowledge.com/p/wtf-is-going-on-at-supermicro-smci?ref=thediff.co)。这种情况可能导致剧烈波动，但需要持续流入新的零售资金才能维持由期权需求驱动的股价，更不用说增加它了。
- en: 'Disclosure: Short a very small amount of SMCI, as part of a larger basket of
    overhyped-AI bets (these bets are partly offsetting long bets on big tech companies
    that should benefit from AI, but in the short term it''s not a hedge at all; the
    weaker or more retail investor-oriented AI bets tend to go up when more mainstream
    AI bets go down, because the levered investors who are shorting them also tend
    to have levered long exposure to big tech). SMCI is actually a much better business
    than most of them, but I''ve seen more cases where a low-margin company temporarily
    under-earns than cases where such a company''s economics permanently reset.'

  zh: 披露：作为一篮子被过度炒作的AI赌注的一部分，少量SMCI空头。这些赌注部分抵消了对应大型科技公司的多头赌注，后者应该会从AI中受益，但短期内这并不构成对冲；那些较弱或更面向零售投资者的AI赌注往往在更主流的AI赌注下跌时上涨，因为做空它们的杠杆投资者通常也有对大型科技公司的杠杆多头头寸。SMCI实际上比它们大多数更好，但我看到的情况更多是低利润公司暂时低收益，而不是这类公司经济学永久重置的情况。

- en: 'Long ago, in July of 2020, *The Diff* came out with a stern warning: [do not
    treat "annual" GDP numbers as if they are annual numbers, because some countries
    report them by taking a quarter-over-quarter change and annualizing it](https://www.thediff.co/archive/spacs-as-a-call-option-on-hype/#q-q-4-y-y).
    This is relevant once again, as [Israel''s economy shrank 9% from the third to
    fourth quarter last year, which is an annualized pace of 20%](https://www.ft.com/content/763bb384-a974-4222-996f-8aecfbc32074?ref=thediff.co)
    ($, *FT*). But that annualizing only makes sense if the number is a clean long-term
    trend: any economy where a substantial chunk of the labor force switches to the
    armed forces will experience some economic disruption, but that part, at least,
    is a one-time issue. Annoyingly for GDP discourse, the number tends to get discussed
    when it''s extreme, but extreme numbers are more likely to be caused by one-time
    shifts that shouldn''t be extrapolated over an entire year.'

  zh: 很久以前，2020 年 7 月，*The Diff* 发出严厉警告：[不要将“年度” GDP 数字视为年度数字，因为一些国家的报告是通过季度变化进行年化计算的](https://www.thediff.co/archive/spacs-as-a-call-option-on-hype/#q-q-4-y-y)。这再次变得相关，因为[以色列经济去年第三季度到第四季度收缩了

    *FT*）。但这种年化只有在数字是干净的长期趋势时才有意义：任何经济体，其中有大量劳动力转向武装部队，都将经历一些经济中断，但至少这一部分是一次性问题。对于
    GDP 讨论来说，令人恼火的是，这一数字往往在极端情况下讨论，但极端数字更可能是由一次性转变引起的，不应该在整个年度内进行推断。

- en: '*The Diff* has written a few time about the evolution of ad businesses towards
    large platforms that use proprietary data and models to target, giving less flexibility
    to advertisers. One thing that makes this process less straightforward is that
    when the model is wrong, it''s hard for advertisers to have a clear idea of how
    wrong it was and what it cost them. [Both Meta and Google have recently had bugs
    in their ad targeting or view tracking systems, leading them to give refunds](https://www.adexchanger.com/daily-news-roundup/how-facebook-profits-from-overspending-errors-and-speaking-of-hi-google/?ref=thediff.co).
    When there are many dials to turn for ads—which keywords to target, which demographics
    to aim for, what time of day to raise or lower bids to stay competitive, etc.,
    the advertiser has a fair amount of confidence in the connection between their
    spending and revenue. When there''s just one dial, allowing them to spend more
    money to get more customers but leaving all of the details up to the ad platform,
    the difference between a bug and an increase in the platform''s take rate is ambiguous,
    and has to happen on the honor system.'

    got so much attention in the last year or two is that they were writing such big
    checks to new portfolio managers. The hedge fund industry moves fast, but there
    are some places where its structure slows things down, one of which is that many
    employees have long noncompetes: a big offer is partly a way to pay someone to
    quit their job, wait a year, and only *then* start somewhere else. But that also
    means that the funds'' cost structure today is determined by their hiring decisions
    a year ago, and since the interview process is so extensive, the decision to make
    the hire is even earlier than that. So if opportunities for outperformance fluctuate,
    funds will chronically find themselves either understaffed relative to opportunities
    or overpaying for their current performance. We now seem to be [in the latter
