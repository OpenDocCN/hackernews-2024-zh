- en: Systematic reviews are considered by many to constitute the highest level of
    scientific evidence. A caveat is that the methods used in a systematic review
    – combining information from multiple studies – are predicated on all of the reports
    being truthful. Currently, we do not know how frequent fraudulent studies are
    in systematic reviews, or how they affect the resulting evidence base. For a systematic
    review of preclinical studies of depression, we found that potentially fraudulent
    studies were not only common but also that they biased the findings of the review.
    In a sample of 1,035 studies, we found that 19 % of peer-reviewed reports displayed
    data in the form of problematic images. In a majority of the cases, images had
    been altered or recycled in a way that makes us suspect foul play. Making things
    worse, these studies reported larger effect sizes, on average, than did studies
    where we did not identify problems. Counter to commonly held beliefs, reports
    with problematic images were not cited less or published in lower-impact journals,
    nor were their authors isolated to any specific geographic area. The sheer prevalence
    of problematic studies, and the fact that we could not find a simple pattern for
    identifying them, undermines the validity of systematic reviews within our research
    field. We suspect that this is symptomatic of a broader problem that needs immediate
    addressing.
