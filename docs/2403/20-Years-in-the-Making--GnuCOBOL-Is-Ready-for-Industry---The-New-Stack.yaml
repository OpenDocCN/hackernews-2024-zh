    maturity and can compete with proprietary offers in all environments,” said [OCamlPro](https://ocamlpro.com/)
    founder and GnuCOBOL contributor [Fabrice Le Fessant](https://fabrice.lefessant.net/),
    in a [FOSDEM talk](https://ftp.heanet.ie/mirrors/fosdem-video/2024/h2215/fosdem-2024-3249-gnucobol-the-free-industrial-ready-alternative-for-cobol-.av1.webm)

    into executable applications. It is very cross-platform, running Linux, BSD, many
    proprietary Unixes, macOS, and Windows, even Android. And the latest version,
    v.32, is being used in many commercial settings.'

- en: The COBOL (Common Business-Oriented Language) was launched in 1959, a [high-level
    language](https://www.techtarget.com/searchitoperations/definition/COBOL-Common-Business-Oriented-Language)
    primarily to serve the finance and human resources department of large organizations.
    Now an ISO Standard, the latest version (v 35.060) [was posted in 2023](https://standards.iteh.ai/catalog/standards/iso/31d28b41-4fef-4527-9083-0b65e495b32e/iso-iec-1989-2023).

    to be cross-platform. The U.S. Defense Department, which funded the development
    of COBOL, wanted to get away from the practice of supporting different programming
    languages for each vendor’s brand of computer. Portability was the key to COBOL’s
    early success.'

    with as many as 80 billion lines of the stuff still out there, one estimate goes.
    The most amazing part is that [it is still growing](https://thenewstack.io/u-s-unemployment-surge-highlights-dire-need-for-cobol-skills/),
    by 15% a year.

    bundles COBOL into its mainframes. [Micro Focus](https://thenewstack.io/back-future-micro-focus-can-make-hpe-software-purchase/)
    offers COBOL for PCs. And [Fujitsu NetCOBOL](https://www.fujitsu.com/global/products/software/developer-tool/netcobol/)
    runs on both PCs and mainframes.

    such as for banking back-end apps, many of which are being migrated from Micro
    Focus, with users reporting performance improvements as a result. The French [DGFIP](https://www.economie.gouv.fr/files/files/directions_services/dgfip/Rapport/Rapport_2011_version_anglaise.pdf)
    federal agency moved from a GCOS mainframe to GnuCOBOL, with the help of Le Fessant’s
    firm.

- en: Naturally, GnuCOBOL is intuitive to those familiar with the [Unix environment](https://thenewstack.io/fosdem-24-can-the-unix-shell-be-improved-hell-yes/).
    It can compile to C code (C89+), making it extremely portable, from mainframes
    to Raspberry Pi’s, Sobisch said.
  prefs: []

- en: There have been implementations of GnuCOBOL code that run thousands of processors,
    which gave the developers of the project the chance to tune for performance and
    memory usage in large use cases.
  prefs: []

- en: Compliance-wise, it passed 97% of COBOL 85 conformance tests, a success rate
    not yet achieved by proprietary vendors, Sobisch boasted. It’s got 19 dialects,
    including extensions of IBM and Micro Focus.

    said.
  prefs: []

    COBOL crowd to grapple with, Sobisch said. So, no support in GnuCOBOL yet.

- en: Also new is [SuperBOL](https://get-superbol.com/), a [development studio](https://github.com/OCamlPro/superbol-studio-oss)
    for GnuCOBOL developed by Le Fessant’s OCamlPro. It runs as a VSCode Extension
    and features a full COBOL processor (written in [OCaml](https://ocaml.org/)).
    This software is still in the early stages of development, however.

    Summer of Code](https://gnucobol.sourceforge.io/gsoc.html), so a whole new generation
    of coders will be able to say “It’s not just COBOL. It’s GnuCOBOL.”
