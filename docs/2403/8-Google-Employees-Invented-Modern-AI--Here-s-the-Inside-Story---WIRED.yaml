- en: Uszkoreit felt that self-attention could take on much bigger tasks. *There’s
    another way to do this*, he’d argue to anyone who would listen, and some who wouldn’t,
    outlining his vision on whiteboards in Building 1945, named after its address
    on Charleston Road on the northern edge of the Google campus.

- en: One day in 2016, Uszkoreit was having lunch in a Google café with a scientist
    named Illia Polosukhin. Born in Ukraine, Polosukhin had been at Google for nearly
    three years. He was assigned to the team providing answers to direct questions
    posed in the search field. It wasn’t going all that well. “To answer something
    on Google.com, you need something that’s very cheap and high-performing,” Polosukhin
    says. “Because you have milliseconds” to respond. When Polosukhin aired his complaints,
    Uszkoreit had no problem coming up with a remedy. “He suggested, why not use self-attention?”
    says Polosukhin.

- en: Polosukhin sometimes collaborated with a colleague named Ashish Vaswani. Born
    in India and raised mostly in the Middle East, he had gone to the University of
    Southern California to earn his doctorate in the school’s elite machine translation
    group. Afterward, he moved to Mountain View to join Google—specifically a newish
    organization called [Google Brain](https://www.wired.com/2013/05/neuro-artificial-intelligence/).
    He describes Brain as “a radical group” that believed “neural networks were going
    to advance human understanding.” But he was still looking for a big project to
    work on. His team worked in Building 1965 next door to Polosukhin’s language team
    in 1945, and he heard about the self-attention idea. Could that be the project?
    He agreed to work on it.

- en: 'Together, the three researchers drew up a design document called “Transformers:
    Iterative Self-Attention and Processing for Various Tasks.” They picked the name
    “transformers” from “day zero,” Uszkoreit says. The idea was that this mechanism
    would *transform* the information it took in, allowing the system to extract as
    much understanding as a human might—or at least give the illusion of that. Plus
    Uszkoreit had fond childhood memories of playing with the Hasbro action figures.
    “I had two little Transformer toys as a very young kid,” he says. The document
    ended with a cartoony image of six Transformers in mountainous terrain, zapping
    lasers at one another.'

- en: In early 2017, Polosukhin left Google to start his own company. By then new
    collaborators were coming onboard. An Indian engineer named Niki Parmar had been
    working for an American software company in India when she moved to the US. She
    earned a master’s degree from USC in 2015 and was recruited by all the Big Tech
    companies. She chose Google. When she started, she joined up with Uszkoreit and
    worked on model variants to improve Google search.

  zh: 2017年初，Polosukhin离开谷歌创办了自己的公司。当时，新的合作者也加入了。名叫Niki Parmar的印度工程师之前在印度一家美国软件公司工作，后来搬到了美国。她于2015年获得了南加州大学的硕士学位，并被所有的科技巨头公司挖来。她选择了谷歌。刚开始时，她加入了Uszkoreit的团队，并致力于改进谷歌搜索的模型变体。

- en: Another new member was Llion Jones. Born and raised in Wales, he loved computers
    “because it was not normal.” At the University of Birmingham he took an AI course
    and got curious about neural networks, which were presented as a historical curiosity.
    He got his master’s in July 2009 and, unable to find a job during the recession,
    lived on the dole for months. He found a job at a local company and then applied
    to Google as a “hail Mary.” He got the gig and eventually landed in Google Research,
    where his manager was Polosukhin. One day, Jones heard about the concept of self-attention
    from a fellow worker named Mat Kelcey, and he later joined up with Team Transformers.
    (Later, Jones ran into Kelcey and briefed him on the transformer project. Kelcey
    wasn’t buying it. “I told him, ‘I’m not sure that’s going to work,’ which is basically
    the biggest incorrect prediction of my life,” Kelcey says now.)

  zh: 另一位新成员是Llion Jones。出生并在威尔士长大的他，因为喜欢电脑而被认为“不寻常”。在伯明翰大学，他参加了人工智能课程，并对神经网络产生了兴趣，这被当作历史上的一种好奇。他于2009年7月获得硕士学位，在经历了经济衰退期间找不到工作的困境后，靠领取失业救济生活了几个月。后来他在一家当地公司找到了工作，并申请加入谷歌，一场“投机取巧”带来了他的职位，最终他进入了谷歌研究部门，其经理是Polosukhin。一天，Jones从同事Mat
    Kelcey那里听说了自注意力的概念，随后加入了Transformer团队。（后来，Jones遇到Kelcey并向他介绍了Transformer项目。Kelcey并不认同。“我告诉他，‘我不确定这会奏效’，这基本上是我一生中最错误的预测之一，”Kelcey现在说道。）
- en: The transformer work drew in other Google Brain researchers who were also trying
    to improve [large language models](https://www.wired.com/story/how-chatgpt-works-large-language-model/).
    This third wave included Łukasz Kaiser, a Polish-born theoretical computer scientist,
    and his intern, Aidan Gomez. Gomez had grown up in a small farming village in
    Ontario, Canada, where his family would tap maple trees every spring for syrup.
    As a junior at the University of Toronto, he “fell in love” with AI and joined
    the machine learning group—Geoffrey Hinton’s lab. He began contacting people at
    Google who had written interesting papers, with ideas for extending their work.
    Kaiser took the bait and invited him to intern. It wasn’t until months later that
    Gomez learned those internships were meant for doctoral students, not undergrads
    like him.

  zh: 转换器工作吸引了其他谷歌Brain研究员，他们也在试图改进[大语言模型](https://www.wired.com/story/how-chatgpt-works-large-language-model/)。这第三波包括出生于波兰的理论计算机科学家Łukasz
    Kaiser及其实习生Aidan Gomez。Gomez在加拿大安大略省的一个小农村长大，他的家人每年春天都会去挤枫树汁。作为多伦多大学的大三学生，他“爱上了”人工智能，并加入了杰弗里·辛顿实验室的机器学习小组。他开始联系那些写了有趣论文的谷歌研究人员，并提出了延伸他们工作的想法。Kaiser接纳了他的提议，并邀请他来实习。几个月后，Gomez才发现这些实习原本是为博士生而非像他这样的本科生准备的。
