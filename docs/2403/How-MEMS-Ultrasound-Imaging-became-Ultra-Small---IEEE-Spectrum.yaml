- en: To understand how researchers achieved this feat, it’s helpful to know the basics
    of ultrasound technology. Ultrasound probes use transducers to convert electrical
    energy to sound waves that penetrate the body. The sound waves bounce off the
    body’s soft tissue and echo back to the probe. The transducer then converts the
    echoed sound waves to electrical signals, and a computer translates the data into
    an image that can be viewed on a screen.

    piezoelectric crystals or ceramics such as lead zirconium titanate (PZT). When
    hit with pulses of electricity, these slabs expand and contract and generate high-frequency
    ultrasound waves that bounce around within them.

    and into the soft tissue and fluid of the patient’s body. This is not a trivial
    task. Capturing the echo of those waves is like standing next to a swimming pool
    and trying to hear someone speaking under the water. The transducer arrays are
    thus built from layers of material that smoothly transition in stiffness from
    the hard piezoelectric crystal at the center of the probe to the soft tissue of
    the body.

    thickness of the piezoelectric layer. A thinner layer transfers higher frequencies,
    which allow smaller, higher-resolution features to be seen in an ultrasound image,
    but only at shallow depths. The lower frequencies of thicker piezoelectric material
    travel further into the body but deliver lower resolutions.

    parts of the body, with frequencies that range from 1 to 10 megahertz. To image
    large organs deep in the body or a baby in the womb, physicians use a 1- to 2-MHz
    probe, which can provide 2- to 3-millimeter resolution and can reach up to 30
    cm into the body. To image blood flow in arteries in the neck, physicians typically
    use an 8- to 10-MHz probe.

    when the excitement of MEMS as a new technology was peaking. The key element of

    creates sound waves in the air.

    ultrasonic transducer**, or CMUT, is named for its simple capacitor-like structures.
    Stanford University electrical engineer Pierre Khuri-Yakub and colleagues [demonstrated
    the first versions](https://spectrum.ieee.org/nextgen-ultrasound).

- en: The CMUT is based on electrostatic forces in a capacitor formed by two conductive
    plates separated by a small gap. One plate—the micromachined membrane mentioned
    before—is made of silicon or silicon nitride with a metal electrode. The other—typically
    a micromachined silicon wafer substrate—is thicker and more rigid. When a voltage
    is applied, placing opposite charges on the membrane and substrate, attractive
    forces pull and flex the membrane toward the substrate. When an oscillating voltage
    is added, that changes the force, causing the membrane to vibrate, like a struck
    drumhead.

- en: When the membrane is in contact with the human body, the vibrations send ultrasound
    frequency waves into the tissue. How much ultrasound is generated or detected
    depends on the gap between the membrane and the substrate, which needs to be about
    one micrometer or less. Micromachining techniques made that kind of precision
    possible.

- en: 'The other MEMS-based architecture is called the **piezoelectric micromachined
    ultrasonic transducer**, or PMUT, and it works like a miniaturized version of
    a smoke alarm buzzer. These buzzers consist of two layers: a thin metal disk fixed
    around its periphery and a thin, smaller piezoelectric disk bonded on top of the
    metal disk. When voltages are applied to the piezoelectric material, it expands
    and contracts in thickness and from side to side. Because the lateral dimension
    is much larger, the piezo disk diameter changes more significantly and in the
    process bends the whole structure. In smoke alarms, these structures are typically
    4 cm in diameter, and they’re what generates the shrieking sound of the alarm,
    at around 3 kilohertz. When the membrane is scaled down to 100 μm in diameter
    and 5 to 10 μm in thickness, the vibration moves up into megahertz frequencies,
    making it useful for medical ultrasound.'

    sound waves deep into the body and receive the echoes coming back. The membrane’s
    motion was limited by the exceedingly small gap between the membrane and the substrate.
    This constrained the amplitude of the sound waves that could be generated. Combining
    arrays of CMUT devices with different dimensions into a single probe to increase
    the frequency range also compromised the pressure output because it reduced the
    probe area available for each frequency.

    In [experiments in the early 2000s](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1235329),
    the researchers found that increasing the voltage on CMUT-like structures caused
    the electrostatic forces to overcome the restoring forces of the membrane. As
    a result, the center of the membrane collapses onto the substrate.

- en: A collapsed membrane seemed disastrous at first but turned out to be a way of
    making CMUTs both more efficient and more tunable to different frequencies. The
    efficiency increased because the gap around the contact region was very small,
    increasing the electric field there. And the pressure increased because the large
    doughnut-shaped region around the edge still had a good range of motion. What’s
    more, the frequency of the device could be adjusted simply by changing the voltage.
    This, in turn, allowed a single CMUT ultrasound probe to produce the entire ultrasound
    frequency range needed for medical diagnostics with high efficiency.

    and developing the processes needed to produce smooth surfaces and a consistent
    gap thickness. For example, the thin dielectric layer that separates the conductive
    membrane and the substrate must withstand about 100 volts at a thickness of 1
    μm. If the layer has defects, charges can be injected into it, and the device
    can short at the edges or when the membrane touches the substrate, killing the
    device or at least degrading its performance.

    to CMOS electronics and placed them under a silicone rubberlike layer. When a

    several membranes of different sizes into one. This is similar to changing the
    length of guitar strings to generate different tones. The oval membrane provides
    strings of multiple lengths on the same structure with its narrow and wide sections.
    To efficiently vibrate wider and narrower parts of the membrane at different frequencies,
    electrical signals are applied to multiple electrodes placed on corresponding
    regions of the membrane. This approach allowed PMUTs to be efficient over a wider
