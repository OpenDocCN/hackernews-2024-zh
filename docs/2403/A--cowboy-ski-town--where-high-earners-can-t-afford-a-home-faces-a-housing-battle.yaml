    hours, dozens of residents spoke for and against the project, with supporters
    pleading for affordable housing and opponents urging the city to scale back the
    plans or take more time to study the impact. In the end, a divided city council
    voted to approve the Brown Ranch plan. But opponents collected more than 1,000
    signatures to get the development placed on the ballot on March 26, leaving the
    final decision up to voters.

    too many problems for the existing city,” said Engelken. “We’re concerned that
    the infrastructure won’t be in place in this new, large, separate portion of our
    city, and it will create a second-class neighborhood. That the people living there
    will be treated like second-class citizens who don’t have access to public transportation
    or city parks, and we don’t know how many of them are coming from outside.”

- en: With a population of around 13,000, Steamboat has prided itself on its small-town,
    Western feel. While housing has always been a struggle for entry-level and hourly
    workers, Steamboat had been viewed as relatively affordable for middle-income
    professionals compared to other mountain towns, like Vail, Colorado, or Jackson,
    Wyoming.

    on average, and all real estate sales, including condos, increased 64% to $1.1
    million, according to data compiled by Jon Wade, a local realtor. For existing
    homeowners, those rising sale prices have caused property taxes to shoot up, with

- en: That’s put homeownership largely out of reach for most people making less than
    $200,000 a year. And even for those who can afford a home at that price, the competition
    for housing is so fierce given the low inventory that those without all-cash offers
    are often losing out, said local realtors.

    costs and they can’t do it,” said Christy Belton, who has been selling real estate
    in Steamboat for 20 years and whose family has been in the community for five

- en: Steamboat isn’t alone in its struggles. As demand shot up during the pandemic,
