    human attribute—that no other animal seems to be capable of—is the [desire to
    link our minds](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_mind). We want to know
    what the other is thinking. We want to know what our whole species thinks (written
    language) and has learned (school). And yet, minds are not directly observable.
    We have to talk about them. We have a seemingly endless interest in stories, because
    there is information there we crave—how to be. Sharing stories of events and people,
    whether real or fictional, synchronizes our values, provides (perceived) control
    over this insane world via meaning and causal explanations, and creates—not reinforces,
    but *creates*—the basic, primal social bond humans have as we, as listeners, all
    tune into to one point of attention.

    good listener. You know the obvious no-brainer ones already—don’t interrupt, don’t
    look at your phone, make (frequent, but not creepily constant) eye contact, turn
    your body towards the speaker…but the really good advice, the secrets that will
    make you much better at listening to a degree that your relationships are significantly
    more successful, peaceful, gratifying, intimate, and trusting, have to do with
    what you *say.*

    be sad. But, the first step in getting over an emotion is to own it. For a while.
    Don’t tell the person she isn’t feeling it, or worse, make her feel ashamed of
    having the feeling (i.e. “that’s crazy!”). The feeling is there. Face it and it
    will lose its power.

    pathway to the world. Or possibly this person is a sociopath. (2) The person really
    thinks this is helpful to compare stories. The person thinks this is empathy.
    It isn’t. The time for your story is not now. Just say, “Oh man, that must have
    really hurt!” Then, try this: look at the person in the eyes. If you can’t stop

    a sort of shallow string of quick justifications for behavior that aren’t actually
    insightful or productive. You can sit for days and discuss whys without any real
    benefit or helpful solutions. Also, it can often just be a dead-end question.
