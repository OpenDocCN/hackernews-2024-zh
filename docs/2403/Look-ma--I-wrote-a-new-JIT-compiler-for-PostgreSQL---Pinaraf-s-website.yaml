    ago, Python 3.13 got its JIT engine, built with a new JIT compiler construction
    methodology (copy-patch, cf. [research paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.13127.pdf)).
    After reading the paper, I was sold and I just had to try it with PostgreSQL.
    And what a fun ride it’s been so far. This blog post will not cover everything,
    and I prefer other communication methods, but I would like to introduce pg-copyjit,
    the latest and shiniest way to ~~destroy and segfault~~ speed up your PostgreSQL
    server.

    of downtime on my business critical application”. Anyway, its current state is
    for professional hackers, I hope you know better than trusting experimental code
    with a production server.'

    introduced the PostgreSQL world to the magics of JIT compilation, using LLVM.
    They married and there was much rejoicing. Alas, darkness there was in the bright
    castle, for LLVM is a very very demanding husband.
  prefs: []

- en: 'LLVM is a great compilation framework. Its optimizer produces very good and
    efficient code, and Andres went further than what anybody else would have thought
    and tried in order to squeeze the last microsecond of performance in his JIT compiler.
    This is a wonderful work and I don’t know how to express my love for the madness
    this kind of dedication to performance is. But LLVM has a big downside : it’s
    not built for JIT compilation. At least not in the way PostgreSQL will use it:
    the LLVM optimizer is very expensive, but not using it may be worse than no compilation
    at all. And in order to compile only the good stuff, the queries that can enjoy
    the performance boost, the typical query cost estimation is used. And that’s the
    PostgreSQL downside making the whole thing almost impossible: costs in PostgreSQL
    are not designed to mean anything. They are meant to be compared to each other,
    but do not mean anything regarding the real execution time. A query costing 100 may
    run in 1 second, while another costing 1000 may run in 100 milliseconds. It’s
    not a bug, it’s a design decision. That’s why a lot of people (including me) end
    up turning off the JIT compiler: most if not all queries on my production system
    will not get enough from the performance boost to compensate the LLVM optimizer
    cost. If I can run the query 10ms faster but it needed 50ms to be optimized, it’s
    pure loss.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: With copy-patch, you write stencils in C. These stencils are functions with
    holes, and they are compiled by your typical clang compiler (gcc support pending,
    too complicated to explain here). Then when you want to compile something, you
    stitch stencils together, fill in the gaps, and jump straight into your brand
    new “compiled” function.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And this is it. This is the magic of copy-and-patch. You only copy the stencils
    in a new memory area, patch the holes, and voilà.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Of course, you can go further. You can figure out what computation can be done
    at compilation time, you can split loops in several stencils to unroll them, you
    can merge several stencils together to optimize them in one go (creating kind
    of meta-stencils…)

    that much, otherwise I would likely not be blogging about this.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When JIT compilation was introduced, it was suggested on hackers to make LLVM
    a plugin, allowing future extensions to bring other JIT compilers. Back then,
    I was quite skeptical to this idea (but never expressed this opinion, I did not
    want to be wrong later), and it turned out I proved myself wrong… The interface
    is really simple, your .so only needs to provide a single _PG_jit_provider_init
    function, and in this function initialize three callbacks, named compile_expr,
    release_context and reset_after_error. The main one is obviously compile_expr.
    You get one ExprState* parameter, a pointer to an expression, made of opcodes.
    Then it’s “only” a matter of compiling the opcodes together in any way you want,
    mark this built code as executable, and changing the evalfunc to this code instead
    of the PostgreSQL interpreter. This is easy, and you have an automatic fallback
    to the PostgreSQL interpreter if you encounter any opcode you’ve not implemented
    yet.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The copy and patch algorithm (implemented with only a few small optimizations
    so far) is so easy I can explain it here. For each opcode, the compiler will look
    into the stencil collection. If the opcode has a stencil, the stencil is appended
    to the “built” code. Otherwise, the compilation stops and the PostgreSQL interpreter
    will kick in. After appending the stencil, each of its holes are patched with
    the required value.

- en: op is declared as extern ExprEvalStep op; (and NEXT_OP is a bit harder to explain,
    I won’t dig into it here). When building this to a single .o file, the compiler
    will leave a hole in the assembly code, where the address for op will have to
    be inserted (using a relocation). When the stencil collection is built, this information
    is kept and used by the JIT compiler to use the current opcode structure address
    in order to get a working code.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The build process for the stencils is quite fun, not complicated, but fun. The
    first step is to build the stencils to a single .o file, and then extract the
    assembly code and relocations from this .o file into C usable structures, that
    the JIT compiler will link to.

    to get the three needed opcodes for SELECT 42; to work. And there was much joy.
    After this first proof of concept (and I guess some disturbed looks a few days
    ago at PgDay.Paris when people saw me happy with being able to run SELECT 42,
    that may have sound weird), I wrote a DirtyPython (unofficial variant) script
    to automate the assembly code extraction, and in a few hours I implemented function
    calls, single table queries, more complicated data types, introduced a few optimizations…

    It only supports AMD64 because that’s what I have and I can not target everything
    at once. Later I will add ARM64, and I would love to have some time to add support
    for some interesting targets like POWER64 or S390x (these may require some compiler
    patches, sadly, and access to such computers, nudge nudge wink wink)…

- en: Performance-wise, well, keeping in mind that I’ve spent almost no time optimizing
    it, the results are great. Code generation is done in a few hundreds microseconds,
    making it usable even for short queries, where LLVM is simply out of the game.
    On a simple SELECT 42; query, running with no JIT takes 0,3ms, with copyjit it
    requires 0,6ms, LLVM with no optimizations goes to 1,6ms and optimizing LLVM will
    require 6,6ms. Sure, LLVM can create really fast code, but the whole idea here
    is to quickly generate fast enough code, and thus comparing both tools won’t make
    much sense.

    benchmark will be done later on a desktop computer without any kind of thermal
    envelope shenanigans. And I have not optimized my compiler, it’s still quite stupid
    and there is a lot of things that can and must be done.

    work to do (here it’s the where clause), performance relative to the interpreter
    get better. It’s only logical, and what is important here is that even if the
    JIT is an extra, slightly time consuming step, it takes so little time even these
    queries can go a few percents faster.

    that’s what you do when the code is done, this one isn’t yet… If you want to build
    it, the build-stencils.sh file must be run manually first. But again, I do not
    document it yet because I simply can not provide any support for the code in its
    current state.

    that can use it (a GIS server where queries are worth the optimization) and use
    this JIT on my web-application databases, where short query time is a must have,
    and the LLVM optimizations end up being counter-productive.
