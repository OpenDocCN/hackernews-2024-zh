    to their [current properties](https://fortune.com/2023/10/17/housing-market-prices-affordability-lock-in-fannie-mae/)
    in fear of higher mortgage rates and fewer new buyers could afford to buy a home.
    Indeed, housing affordability has gotten so bad that prospective buyers need to
    make about $50,000 more now than pre-pandemic in order to “comfortably” afford
    a home, according to a [Zillow report](https://www.zillow.com/research/buyers-income-needed-33755/)
    released Thursday. And affording a home goes beyond monthly mortgage payments,
    experts agree.

    to cover mortgage payments, property taxes, insurance, and other associated costs
    without significant financial strain,” Stacy Brown, director of technical training
    at [Real Property Management](https://www.realpropertymgt.com/), tells *Fortune*.
    Considering “the fact that the boomer generation is staying in their homes rather
    than moving to retirement communities, as well as those who moved to the suburbs
    during the pandemic [choosing to work] remotely—comfortable home ownership is
    out of reach for many.”

    more than January 2020, [Zillow](https://fortune.com/company/zillow-group/) says.
    Monthly mortgage payments on a “typical home,” which Zillow defines as costing
    $343,000, have nearly doubled in that time frame to $2,188, assuming a 10% down
    payment. And while mortgage rates and home prices are the main culprits behind
    today’s housing affordability challenges, there are other factors that make buying
    a home more costly.

    In 2023 alone, home prices increased nearly 6%, according to the [Case-Shiller
    National Home Price Index](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CSUSHPINSA) (a real
    estate industry standard measure). Meanwhile, mortgage rates ended January 2020
    at about 3.5%, half of today’s 30-year fixed mortgage rate of 7.1%, according
    to [Mortgage News Daily](https://www.mortgagenewsdaily.com/).

- en: While looking at mortgage rates and home prices alone is dire enough, wages
    also haven’t kept up with the demands of a home purchase. A household earning
    a $59,000 salary in 2020 could comfortably afford the monthly mortgage, meaning
    they wouldn’t spend more than 30% of their income with a 10% down payment, according
    to Zillow. That was below the U.S. median income at the time, which clocked in
    at about $66,000, “meaning more than half of American households had the financial
    means to afford homeownership,” Anushna Prakash, a Zillow economic analyst, wrote
    in the report.

    in younger age groups and individuals with lower incomes,” Jaclyn Anastasakos,
    a real estate agent with [Luxe Properties](https://luxeknows.com/) in Miami, tells
    *Fortune*. “The gap between income levels and housing costs has widened, making
    it harder for many to achieve the dream of owning a home.”

    homeowners need more than $106,000 to “comfortably” purchase a home. That means
    that wages haven’t kept pace with home prices, mortgage rates, and other costs
    associated with buying a house in the U.S. Filippo Incorvaia, owner and broker
    at Miami-based [FI Real Estate](https://www.fi.realestate/), says housing affordability
    “feels the most intense” since he started his career 20 years ago.

    *Fortune.* “This usually means both partners are typically working and contributing,
    and you could still be strained financially. Meanwhile, purchasing a property
    alone is more challenging than ever.”

    high demand and limited supply “may require an even higher income to afford a
    home,” Brown says.

    affluent or renovated continue to command higher home prices,” Brown says. “Couple
    that with major employers moving operations to states with more favorable taxes
    or other incentives, [and] many areas that were considered affordable are quickly
    becoming out of reach for many.”

    entirely” because housing affordability has gotten so strained. The majority of
    his first-time homebuyers are professionals in their 30s and 40s who have been
    focused on their career while renting and saving for a down payment.

    and millennials have turned to “house hacking,” or co-buying with friends or family.
    They then rent out all or part of these properties in order to generate extra
    income. Zillow reports that [21% of last year’s buyers](https://www.zillow.com/research/buyers-housing-trends-report-2023-32978/)
    did this. While this might seem like a good idea in the interim as mortgage payments
    stay high, house hacking has its downsides.

    couples choose to purchase a property together to reduce costs, but this also
    reduces equity and may not be the most viable long term solution.”
