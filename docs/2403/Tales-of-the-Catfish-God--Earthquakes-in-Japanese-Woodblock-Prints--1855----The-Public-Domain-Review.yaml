- en: It is the socially leveling aspect of the earthquake’s impact that is to account,
    at least in part, for the celebratory spirit that characterizes so many of the
    prints created in the weeks following the disaster. In one memorable [example](https://www.vads.ac.uk/digital/collection/CSM/id/498/),
    a catfish commits seppuku, only to have money spill out of the slash in his belly
    instead of blood. In [another](https://images.app.goo.gl/EqmXshpuWj6ZAFLL7), the
    artist has endowed the catfish with a whale-like blowhole out of which it expels
    a shower of coins, to the delight of onlookers on the shore. In this subgenre
    of *namazu-e*, [writes](https://muse.jhu.edu/article/200155/pdf?casa_token=Zcd6nLhwxn0AAAAA:omxTlj2O7r9VAop0dlUZ3T75LKToVFtyUUvDX1Y_qbVe8EYt3aX3WFN41cTctnsS2F7rVA12oaw)
    Smits, the fish are imagined as forces of *yo-naoshi*, or world-rectification,
    restoring balance to society by redistributing wealth hoarded by the rich. Beneath
    the rubble of the old world, a new and fairer one perhaps lay waiting — for those
    willing and able to bring it into being.
