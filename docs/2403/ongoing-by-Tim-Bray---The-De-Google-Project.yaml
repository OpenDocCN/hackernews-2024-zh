- en: My family, like most, depends on a lot of online services. And again like most,
    a lot of those services come from Big Tech giants in general and (in our case)
    Google in particular. And like many people, we are becoming less comfortable with
    that. So I’m going to try to be systematic about addressing the problem. This
    post summarizes our dependencies and then I’ll post blog pieces about updates
    as I work my way through the list. (The first is already posted, see below.)

- en: Office · We’ve been using Gmail for a really long time and are used to it, and
    the integration between mail and calendar and maps basically Just Works. The price
    is OK but it keeps going up, and so do our data storage requirements, what with
    all the cameras in the family. Finally, Google has stewardship of our lives and
    are probably monetizing every keystroke. We’re getting a bit creeped out over
    that.

- en: Maps · As I [wrote in 2017](/ongoing/When/201x/2017/06/29/Fear-Google-Reviews),
    Google maps aggregate directions, reviews, descriptions, phone numbers, and office
    hours. They are potentially a nuclear-powered monopoly engine. I use Maps more
    and more; if I want to contact or interact with something whose location I know,
    it’s way quicker to pull up Maps and click on their listing than it is to use
    Google search and fight through all the ads and spam.

    to a meeting, pull up the calendar app and tap on the meeting and it drops you
    right into directions.

    in 2019; but Android Auto’s music powers drew me back to Google Maps. Aside from
    that, [Magic Earth](https://www.magicearth.com) is trying, and their business
    model seems acceptable, but the product was pretty rough-edged last time I tried
    it.

    to support open source. But… I really like Lightroom, and sometimes one absolutely
    needs Photoshop, so I’m unlikely to prioritize this particular escape attempt.

    I fat-fingered it into place either in the car or on my phone.'

    neutral. It knows the general concepts of “apps that play music” and “apps that
    are maps” and is happy to display whichever ones you want, not just Google’s.
    (As a former Android geek who knows about Intents and Filters, I can see how this
    works. Clever.)

    routes and I can see which one is backed up by sewer work or whatever.
