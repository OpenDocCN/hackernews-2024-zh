- en: In the old days, if you were a white-collar worker, the deal was that you worked
    as hard as you could at the start of your career to earn the right to be rewarded
    later on, with security of tenure and a series of increasingly senior positions.
    This is no longer true. Today, many senior leaders work longer and harder than
    ever. At the heart of it is insecurity, and indeed, elite professional organizations
    deliberately set out to identify and recruit “insecure overachievers.” Insecure
    overachievers are exceptionally capable and fiercely ambitious, yet are driven
    by a profound sense of their own inadequacy. If this sounds familiar, you should
    try to work exceptionally long hours when you need to or want to — but do it consciously,
    for specified time periods, and to achieve specific goals. Don’t let it become
    a habit because you have forgotten how to work or live any other way.
