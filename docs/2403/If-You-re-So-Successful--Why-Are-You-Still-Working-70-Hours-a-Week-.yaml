- en: In the old days, if you were a white-collar worker, the deal was that you worked
    as hard as you could at the start of your career to earn the right to be rewarded
    later on, with security of tenure and a series of increasingly senior positions.
    This is no longer true. Today, many senior leaders work longer and harder than
    ever. At the heart of it is insecurity, and indeed, elite professional organizations
    deliberately set out to identify and recruit “insecure overachievers.” Insecure
    overachievers are exceptionally capable and fiercely ambitious, yet are driven
    by a profound sense of their own inadequacy. If this sounds familiar, you should
    try to work exceptionally long hours when you need to or want to — but do it consciously,
    for specified time periods, and to achieve specific goals. Don’t let it become
    a habit because you have forgotten how to work or live any other way.

  zh: 在过去，如果你是一名白领工作者，协议是你在职业生涯初期尽可能努力工作，以赢得后来的安全保障和一系列日益高级的职位。但今天这已经不再成立。如今，许多高级领导人工作的时间比以往任何时候都要长，而且更辛苦。其核心是不安全感，事实上，精英专业组织有意识地试图识别和招募“不安全感过强的高成就者”。这些人才极其能干，野心勃勃，却被自己的不足感深深驱使着。如果这听起来耳熟，你应该在需要或想要的时候，有意识地努力工作长时间——但要为了特定的时间段和达成具体的目标。不要让它成为习惯，因为你已经忘记了如何以其他方式工作或生活。
