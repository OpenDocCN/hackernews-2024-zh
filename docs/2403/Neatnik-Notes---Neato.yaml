- en: If I were ever going to get a tattoo, it might be the text haste makes waste
    set in a stern-looking font, located somewhere that I’m likely to see it very
    often (like maybe on my left hand so I’d see it whenever I glance at my watch).
    Of all of the aphorisms, it’s the one that I feel the hardest but forget the most
    often.

- en: At the end of 2022, I hastily added the most ambitious feature yet to [omg.lol](https://omg.lol),
    which was a brand new blogging engine that I (predictably) called [weblog.lol](https://weblog.lol).
    I started building it on December 1, with the goal of finishing by Christmas.
    It was a totally arbitrary goal, and even though I succeeded in meeting my own
    deadline, I didn’t do myself any favors with the rushed execution. I wound up
    laying down a problematic foundation—*but it’s OK*, I kept telling myself, *because
    I can always fix it all later!* And of course you can guess how that went. (I
    probably need another tattoo about procrastination.)

    for improvements to omg.lol’s content management stuff, and I’ve been mulling
    over all of the details related to that for the past few weeks. Most of that time
    was spent trying to come up with a cool name for the new thing that’s going to
    be at the heart of it all, and now that I’ve finally landed on one, I can announce
    that [Neato](https://neato.pub) will launch this summer.

- en: I’ve been working on content management and publishing systems for nearly three
    decades, both personally and professionally, and this feels like the right time
    to finally take what I’ve learned and direct it into a single awesome thing. Neato
    will be a standalone service, but it’ll also be available as part of [Web 1 Land](https://web1.land)
    and [omg.lol](https://omg.lol) (where it will power just about everything from
    profile pages to statuslog entries). I am *really* excited about it.

- en: That last point is important, because as anyone who’s used weblog.lol knows,
    I dropped the ball on documentation and never picked it up again. I’ve amassed
    enough guilt over that to fuel some genuinely impressive documentation efforts
    for Neato, and I’m looking forward to showing that I *can* actually get that right.

- en: Neato will be ready when it’s ready. I want it to be ready this summer, but
    I also really don’t want to have to get the tattoo that I described above, so
    I’m not going to commit to anything beyond aiming to have a beta ready in a few
    months. When it’s ready, though, I can promise that it’ll be worth the wait.

    there soon (built with Neato itself, of course)!
