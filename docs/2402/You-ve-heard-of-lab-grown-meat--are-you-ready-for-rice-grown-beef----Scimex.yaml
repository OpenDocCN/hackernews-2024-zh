- en: International researchers have developed a beef-rice hybrid they say could be
    a protein-rich food of the future. The team says they took muscle and fat stem
    cells from cows, and transplanted them into grains of rice - because the porous
    nature of rice allows room for the stem cells to grow within the rice in a petri
    dish. After 9-11 days, they say the rice became a safe, usable ingredient that
    contained 8% more protein and 7% more fat than regular rice. The researchers say
    creating this hybrid food releases fewer greenhouse gases than if the same amount
    of protein was produced with traditional beef farming, and protein-enhanced foods
    such as this could one day help feed people in situations where food is hard to
    come by, from famines to space travel.

- en: From lab-grown chicken to cricket-derived protein, these innovative alternatives
    offer hope for a planet struggling with the environmental and ethical impacts
    of industrial agriculture. Now, Korean scientists add a new recipe to the list—cultured
    beef rice—by growing animal muscle and fat cells inside rice grains. The method,
    presented February 14 in the journal *Matter*, results in a nutritious and flavorful
    hybrid food that, once commercialized, could offer a more affordable protein alternative
    with a smaller carbon footprint.

    says first author Sohyeon Park, who conducted the study under the guidance of
    corresponding author Jinkee Hong at Yonsei University, South Korea. “Rice already
    has a high nutrient level, but adding cells from livestock can further boost it.”

    growth to form tissue and organs. To cultivate cell-cultured meat, the team mimicked
    this cellular environment—using rice. Rice grains are porous and have organized
    structures, providing a solid scaffold to house animal-derived cells in the nooks
    and crannies. Certain molecules found in rice can also nourish and promote the
    growth of these cells, making rice an ideal platform.

    helps cells latch onto the rice better. Cow muscle and fat stem cells were then
    seeded into the rice and left to culture in the petri dish for 9 to 11 days. The
    harvested final product is a cell-cultured beef rice with main ingredients that
    meet food safety requirements and have a low risk of triggering food allergies.

    various food industry analyses, including nutritional value, odor, and texture.
    The findings revealed that hybrid rice has 8% more protein and 7% more fat than
    regular rice. Compared to the typical sticky and soft texture, the hybrid rice
    was firmer and brittler. Hybrid rice with higher muscle content had beef- and
    almond-related odor compounds, while those with higher fat content had compounds
    corresponding to cream, butter, and coconut oil.

    consumes a lot of resources and water and releases a lot of greenhouse gas,” says
    Park. The team’s product has a significantly smaller carbon footprint at a fraction
    of the price. For every 100 g of protein produced, hybrid rice is estimated to
    release less than 6.27 kg of CO2, while beef releases 49.89 kg. If commercialized,
    the hybrid rice could cost around $2.23 per kilogram, while beef costs $14.88.

    production process, the team is optimistic about commercializing the product.
    But before the rice makes its way to our stomachs, the team plans to create better
    conditions in the rice grain for both muscle and fat cells to thrive, which can
    further boost the nutritional value.

    a world of possibilities for this grain-based hybrid food. It could one day serve
    as food relief for famine, military ration, or even space food.”
