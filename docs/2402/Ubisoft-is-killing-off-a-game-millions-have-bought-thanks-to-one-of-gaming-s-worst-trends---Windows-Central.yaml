    long, but for long time fans of the series there's disappointing news regarding
    one of its predecessors.

- en: The delisting of racing games is common, as license agreements for the vehicles
    within have a finite duration. It's happened to older Forza games, for example,
    but at least with Forza, you can still play the old games if you own them.

    when the servers get turned off, the door is closed. The Crew is no more.

- en: What this means is that something you've spent your hard-earned money on will
    no longer exist, even if you have a physical copy. It's just gone. Finito. Sony
    has recently been receiving its own flak for the removal of digital content that
    its customers have bought, and while on a smaller scale, Ubisoft is doing the
    same. This wasn't a free to play game, it was a big budget AAA release.

    goes down for maintenance and there's absolutely no part of the game I can play
    until the servers come back. That's a small thing in comparison to just taking
    away access to a whole game people have paid for.

- en: It's an increasing frustration where server outages, and in this case a full
    shutdown, stop gamers enjoying the games they want to play. Naturally, if it's
    an entirely multiplayer experience, it's different, but a game like The Crew should
    absolutely have an offline player mode. It's an open world racing game, all the
    content has already been added. Why can't someone play through the campaign again
    or just drive around having a good time?

- en: It would be nice if Ubisoft had said it would drop a patch for the game to give
    it an offline mode before they turn the servers off, but that's probably wishful
    thinking. It just highlights once again the lack of ownership we have over much
    of our content in the present day. Games with offline play are the best kind of
    games.

- en: I enjoyed The Crew and its expansion Wild Run. The story was a bit lame, but
    I thought it was a better crack at a Need for Speed-type title than most Need
    for Speed games have been. I guess I've got a few months to load it back up one
    final time, for old time's sakes. Then I guess I'll have to throw the disc away,
    and that makes me sad.
