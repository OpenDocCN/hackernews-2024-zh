    logic programming, imperative programming, and [constraint solving](https://www.hillelwayne.com/post/minizinc/).
    I originally learned it to help with vacation scheduling but soon discovered its
    `planner` module, which is one of the most fascinating programming models I’ve
    ever seen.'

    and functional programming, we take inputs and write algorithms that produce outputs.
    In LP and constraint solving, we instead provide a set of equations and find assignments
    that satisfy those relationships. For example:'

- en: Non-function identifiers that start with lowercase letters are “atoms”, or unique
    tokens. Identifiers that start with uppercase letters are variables. So `[a, b,
    c, a]` is a list of four atoms, while `Arr` and `X` are variables. So `Member(X,
    Arr)` returns true as you’d expect.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The interesting thing is `Member(Y, Arr)`. Y wasn’t defined yet! So Picat finds
    a value for Y that *makes* the equation true. Y could be any of `a`, `b`, or `c`.
    Then the line after that makes it impossible for `Y` to be `a`, so this prints
    either `ab` or `ac`. Picat can even handle expressions like `member(a, Z)`, instantiating
    Z as a list!

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Writing `action ?=>` instead of `action =>` makes `action` backtrackable, which
    I’ll admit I don’t *fully* understand? I’m *pretty sure* it means that if *this*
    definition of `action` pattern-matches but doesn’t lead to a viable plan, then
    Picat can try *other* definitions of action. This’ll matter more for later versions.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As with the introductory example up top, we’re using `member` to both *find*
    values (on line `(a)`) and *test values* (on lines `(b)`). Picat also has a non-assigning
    predicate, `membchk`, which just does testing. If I wasn’t trying to showcase
    Picat I could instead have use `membchk` for the testing part, which cannot assign.
