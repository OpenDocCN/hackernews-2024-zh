    may have less to do with employee productivity or profit margins and everything
    to do with catering to the egos of controlling managers who want their workers
    back, according to a [recent study](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4675401)
    published by researchers at the University of Pittsburgh.

    Graduate School of Business, who led the study, told BI he started the research

    Ma said, could be due to higher expenses caused by bringing employees back to
    the office. Even if employee productivity is better in the office, he said, the
    firm also needs to spend a lot of expenses to accommodate them — parking, office
    space, catering, or other in-house costs — which he says mitigates the positive
    benefits of enhanced productivity.
