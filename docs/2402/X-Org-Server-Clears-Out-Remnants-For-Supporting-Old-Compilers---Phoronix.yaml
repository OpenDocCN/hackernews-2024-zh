- en: There are still no signs of a new X.Org Server feature release coming in the
    near-term with most of the major stakeholders divesting from the xorg-server besides
    the XWayland portion of the code-base. But for those interested in the past few
    days there have been some NetBSD/OpenBSD build fixes to the X.Org Server as well
    as clearing out some remnants of old compiler support.

- en: While some may argue against dropping support for old and outdated compilers
    on the basis of the X.Org Server's importance and history, support for these environments
    were effectively dead already. Due to the switch from the GNU Autoconf to Meson
    build system for the X.Org Server, Meson doesn't support these outdated targets
    and in turn weren't buildable as it was. Thus it's just removing dead code at
    this stage.

    to see if any new X.Org Server feature release(s) take place in 2024 outside of
    the XWayland scope given the diminishing developer interest and lots of talk but
    little action by those anti-Wayland holdouts in the community to actually contribute
    to X.Org Server development.
