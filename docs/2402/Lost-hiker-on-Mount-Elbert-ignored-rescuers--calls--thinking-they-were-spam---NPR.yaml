    get lost hiking that mountain, you should probably answer your phone — even if
    you don't recognize the caller's number.

- en: That's the message being spread by Lake County Search and Rescue, which tried
    to help a lost hiker on Mount Elbert by sending out search teams and repeatedly
    calling the hiker's phone. All to no avail. The hiker spent the night on the side
    of the mountain before finally reaching safety.

    us because they didn''t recognize the number," the rescue unit said [on its Facebook

- en: Mount Elbert is the tallest peak in the Rocky Mountains with an elevation of
    14,433 feet. Both of the trails leading to its summit are "well trodden class
    one trails," the [U.S. Forest Service says](https://www.fs.usda.gov/wps/portal/fsinternet/cs/recarea?ss=110308&navtype=BROWSEBYSUBJECT&cid=FSE_003738&navid=110240000000000&pnavid=110000000000000&position=generalinfo&recid=12506&ttype=recarea&pname=Mount%20Elbert%20Trails%20(Fourteener)),
    meaning they're not very technical and don't require special gear. But the South
    Elbert Trail that the hiker was on does have an elevation gain of about 4,800
    feet, and the mountain is currently capped with snow.

    seven hours](https://rootsrated.com/stories/hike-colorado-s-highest-mountain-mount-elbert)
    to complete, round-trip. A caller alerted search and rescue teams around 8 p.m.,
    and a five-person team stayed in the field looking for the hiker until 3 a.m.,
    when the team suspended the search.

    having finally made it back to their car. The hiker had gotten disoriented in

    also urged hikers on the mountain to "please remember that the trail is obscured
    by snow above treeline, and will be in that condition now through probably late
    June. Please don't count on following your ascent tracks to descend the mountain,
    as wind will often cover your tracks."

    help them, but this is not the case nation-wide."'
