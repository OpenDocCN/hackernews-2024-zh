    Kong (just 60km from the world’s top gambling hub in Macau) is on who will get
    the 300 newly arrived 8-card A100 servers. Total value: 800 million RMB. This
    is three days after the U.S. extended the scope of export controls on chips to
    include close substitutes for the NVIDIA A100 (which had been banned a year earlier).
    Procurement teams from e-commerce giant Pinduoduo and software leader Kingsoft
    arrived overnight to compete over the servers. “*Where did the goods come from?
    No one knows, it’s said to be a very clever company, and it was obtained through
    NVIDIA’s unauthorized channels; what’s the specific price? There is no precise
    figure*.”'

    *Meiri Renwu* [每日人物] reporters trace the lengths Chinese companies will go to
    get high-end AI chips. Two of the key interviewees are Zipeng Wang and Wenbo Sun
    (pseudonyms), who work at server manufacturers, which means they’ve seen all of
    this up close — panic buying, speculative booms, and whack-a-mole. Under the *Renwu*
    platform, *Meiri Renwu* was the source of a previous ChinAI feature article, which
    asked six different large language models to summarize China’s 2023(**[ChinAI

    business doesn’t do much with large models, and there hasn’t been much news about
    its own research on large models. “However, in the AI era, it is better to bet
    first than to miss out.” As for Kingsoft, industry circles think that it can’t
    afford such a large order. “*Ambiguous transactions, as well as rumors, speculations,
    and bets, have all become a footnote to the madness of large models and A100s*.”

    but NVIDIA''s foundry, TSMC, has limited production capacity. In addition to competition
    among major manufacturers, the U.S. chip blockade against China has also made
    it more difficult for domestic tech giants to purchase high-end chips like the
    A100\. All parties are panic buying the A100’s ‘successors’, including the A800,
    H100, and H800s, and the prices have skyrocketed. At the craziest time, in just
    one week, the price of a server composed of 8 A800s can increase from 2.3 million
    to 3.3 million. For a while, Wenbo Sun experienced misgivings: Why did it seem
    like he was speculating on Bitcoin?*”'

    became a hot commodity. And just in October 2022, the U.S. Department of Commerce
    imposed additional export restrictions on high-performance chips, prohibiting
    U.S. companies from selling high-end chips to Chinese entities, and the A100 was
    among them. Policy is policy, and business is business. NVIDIA launched the A800,
    a special version of the A100 for China. Wang made an analogy. Compared with the
    A100, the A800 ‘is like making the oil pipe of a car a little thinner, but the
    engines and tires are still the original*.’”'

    the matter revealed that Bytedance purchased approximately 13,600 A100 chips.
    Based on the minimum price of a card of 70,000 RMB, these chips alone are worth
    952 million RMB.*” The article continues, “*Based on its internal data, a major
    tech giant estimates that Bytedance currently has more than 200,000 computing
    power chips, **of which about 100,000 are high-end computing power chips such
    as the A100/A800/H800s**. A small part of these chips are rented out, and the
    high-computing chips that are not rented out are used for the training and inference
    of Bytedance’s large models*.”

    chips. “*Wang and Sun both received news that Bytedance and Alibaba were the first
    to place orders with NVIDIA, ‘both placing orders for nearly 10,000 cards.’ The
    reason why Baidu was the first to launch Ernie Bot (Wenxin yiyan) was because
    it purchased computing chips in advance*.”

    with computing power is around 150,000-200,000, and the minimum price is 4 units.

    professor complaining about how the skyrocketing price of computing power has
    hindered his own project: a “small model” approach to equipping drones with AI
    programs to check whether wires remain intact in uninhabited areas in southern
    China (the programs identify where there are cracks in the wire insulators and
    then report the location for repair). From the article: “*He doesn’t understand
    the huge number of large models today. ‘There are so many large language models,
    and then what?’ In his opinion, many large model products are more of a gimmick
    with no practical uses, and spending so much money, resources, and computing power

    report on how governing compute can contribute toward ensuring the safety and
    beneficial uses of AI. I especially liked the section on the use of compute regulations
    to enforce certain rules (e.g., enforcing “compute caps” via physical limits on
    chip-to-chip, hardware-based remote enforcement, and preventing risky training
    runs via multiparty control). The appendix on the compute-uranium analogy was
    also illuminating.
