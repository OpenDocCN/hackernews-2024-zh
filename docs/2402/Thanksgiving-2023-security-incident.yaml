    use of hard security keys enforced using our own Zero Trust tools, the threat
    actor’s ability to move laterally was limited. No services were implicated, and
    no changes were made to our global network systems or configuration. This is the

    stolen credentials to get access to our Atlassian server and accessed some documentation
    and a limited amount of source code. Based on our collaboration with colleagues
    in the industry and government, we believe that this attack was performed by a
    nation state attacker with the goal of obtaining persistent and widespread access
    to Cloudflare’s global network.

    to validate that the threat actor could not gain access to our environment. Additionally,

    with an eye on gaining a deeper foothold. Because of that, we decided a huge effort

    the operations of our network as a way to get back in. Even though we believed,

    physically segment test and staging systems, performed forensic triages on 4,893

    information, Cloudflare Workers deployed by us or customers, AI models, network

- en: A large part of our “Code Red” effort was understanding what the threat actor
    got access to and what they tried to access. By looking at logging across systems
    we were able to track attempted access to our internal metrics, network configuration,
    build system, alerting systems, and release management system. Based on our review,
    none of their attempts to access these systems were successful. Independently,
    CrowdStrike performed an assessment of the scope and extent of the threat actor’s
    activity, which did not bring to light activities that we had missed and concluded
    that the last evidence of threat activity was on November 24 at 10:44.

    CrowdStrike 对威胁演员活动的范围和程度进行了评估，未发现我们遗漏的活动，并得出结论称最后一次威胁活动发生在11月24日10:44。

  zh: 结论
- en: This was a security incident involving a sophisticated actor, likely a nation-state,
    who operated in a thoughtful and methodical manner. The efforts we have taken
    ensure that the ongoing impact of the incident was limited and that we are well-prepared
    to fend off any sophisticated attacks in the future. This required the efforts
    of a significant number of Cloudflare’s engineering staff, and, for over a month,
    this was the highest priority at Cloudflare. The entire Cloudflare team worked
    to ensure that our systems were secure, the threat actor’s access was understood,
    to remediate immediate priorities (such as mass credential rotation), and to build
    a plan of long-running work to improve our overall security based on areas for
    improvement discovered during this process.

    the Thanksgiving holiday to conduct an initial analysis and lock out the threat
    actor, and all those who contributed to this effort. It would be impossible to
    name everyone involved, but their long hours and dedicated work made it possible
    to undertake an essential review and change of Cloudflare’s security while keeping
    our global network running and our customers’ service running.
