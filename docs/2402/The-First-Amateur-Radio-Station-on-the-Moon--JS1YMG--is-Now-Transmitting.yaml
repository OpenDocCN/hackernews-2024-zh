- en: The Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) successfully landed their Smart
    Lander for Investigating Moon (SLIM) on January 19, 2024\. Just before touchdown,
    SLIM released two small lunar surface probes, LEV-1 and LEV-2.

    for LEV-1, which has been transmitting Morse code on 437.41 MHz since January
    19\. The probe uses a 1 W UHF antenna with circular polarization and is transmitting

    EA4GPZ, blog](https://destevez.net/2024/01/trying-to-decode-lev-1/) introducing
    the method and extraction results for demodulating Morse code from the signal,
    as well as extracting the code string.

    designed to survive a lunar night, which lasts about 14 days, and is due to return
    in a few days.

    the mission of analyzing the composition of rocks to aid research about the origin
    of the moon. SLIM's landing made Japan the fifth country to achieve a soft touchdown
    on the moon. The landing was achieved with exceptional precision -- within 180
    feet of its targeted touchdown location.
