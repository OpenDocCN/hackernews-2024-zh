    When the data community started using this term it simply meant a set of products

    all interacted with one another via SQL.

    the fact that a product had been designed to take advantage of the cloud was important.
    It created massive differentiation for those products—many ran circles around
    pre-existing products because they were built from scratch with totally different
    priors.

    I would only work with MDS tooling. It was so much better that I simply wouldn’t
    take on a project if the client wanted to use pre-cloud tools. I, and others like
    me, needed a way to talk about this preference, to differentiate between these
    new products and all of the other ones that we didn’t want to use. The term actually
    conveyed important information.

    compares Looker and Tableau, and criticizes Tableau for not being able to effectively
    process certain types of data (particularly clickstream data). This was true…*in
    2016*. Tableau’s Redshift integration back then was quite bad; the SQL that it
    wrote was not at all performant on large datasets. This should not be surprising
    because nearly all data processing in Tableau happened via local extracts at the
    time. Tableau on top of clickstream data wasn’t really a thing, as prior to Redshift
    *almost no BI tech* could handle clickstream data and users didn’t expect this.'

    go on its cloud journey, but it is one that *most* pre-cloud data companies have
    gone through. I have talked to the founders of so many of these companies and
    “migrating to the cloud” is almost always this harrowing bet-the-company march
    through the desert. But it’s so existential that everyone does it anyway (or dies

    its cloud-native capabilities? Not…really? I don’t think anyone would say “Tableau

    really conveying at this point? The useful information content that existed in
    2016 is no longer present.

    and a very senior banker said something like “the market can’t get enough of all
    of these modern data stack companies!” I was confused, because a) I was in the
    community that coined that term, and b) there were no publicly-traded MDS companies
    I knew of aside from Snowflake. So, I asked him what companies he was referring
    to. He mentioned Mongo, Datadog, and Confluent.

    shark. From 2020 to 2022, the meteoric rise of Snowflake and Databricks and a
    few other companies had caused (mostly private market) investors to go all-in
    on this market trend in a way that very rarely happens. And so being a “modern
    data stack” company was valuable. Just like an index fund needs to hold a certain
    % in each stock in the index, every VC needed exposure to the MDS trend. And this
    euphoria bled into public market investors who sought out whatever exposure they
    could get.

    real adoption trends, and in turn drove press interest, and then further customer
    awareness and adoption. The number of enterprise CDOs who woke up to the MDS in
    that 3-year period was incredible, and it was driven by this cycle of early-adopters
    > investors > press coverage > more adopters.

    a strong preference to buy integrated solutions rather than to buy many tools
    to construct a stack. Buyer willingness to construct a stack from 8-12 vendors
    has declined significantly. Companies are much more likely today to expect to
    buy 2-4 products as the core of their analytics infrastructure. This creates yet
    more pressure for consolidation, and will likely drive more M&A activity and competition
