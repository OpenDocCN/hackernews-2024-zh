- en: I used to think that behavioral interviews were basically useless, because it
    was too easy for candidates to bullshit them and too hard for me to tell what
    was a good answer. I’d end up grading every candidate as an “okay, I guess” because
    I was never sure what bar I should hold them to.

    way too many of them, I now think it’s possible to escape that trap. Here are
    my tips and tricks for doing so!

    If I spend a couple hours thinking about what questions and follow-ups to ask,
    I’m much more likely to get a strong signal about which candidates performed well.
  prefs: []

- en: It might sounds ridiculous to spend 2 hours building a 1-hour interview that
    you’ll only give 4 times. But it’s worth it! Your most limited resource is time
    with candidates, so if you can spend more of your own time to use candidates’
    time better, that’s worth it.

    answers to these questions would distinguish a great candidate from a mediocre
    one, and how can I dig for that?” I find that if I wait until after the interview
    to evaluate candidates, I rarely have conviction about them, and fall back to
    grading them a “weak hire” or “weak no-hire.”'

- en: To avoid this, write yourself a rubric of all the things you care about assessing,
    and what follow-up questions you’ll ask to assess those things. This will help
    you deliver the interview consistently, but most importantly, you’ll ask much
    better follow-up questions if you’ve thought about them beforehand. See [the appendix](#appendix-example-rubric)
    for an example rubric.

    15 minutes, which only leaves time to discuss a small number of scenarios. For
    example, for a head of technical recruiting, I decided to focus my interview on
    the cluster of related traits of being great at communication, representing our
    culture to candidates, and holding a high bar for job candidate experience.

    time when [X situation happened]. Just give me some brief high-level context on
    the situation, what the problem was,^(^✻ For behaviors that involve addressing
    problems—reword “problem” as something else as appropriate.) and how you addressed
    it. You can keep it high-level and I’ll ask follow-up questions afterward.”

    that sounds vaguely like it makes sense, even if they don’t actually usually behave
    in the ways you’re looking for. To figure out whether they’re real or BSing you,
    the best way is to get them to tell you a lot of details about the situation—the
    more you get them to tell you, the harder it will be to BS all the details.

    answer looks like. See [the appendix](#appendix-example-rubric) for an example.

    in behavioral interviews. “In recruiting, it’s all about communication!” “No org

    I can think of lots of individual things I could have done better!)'
