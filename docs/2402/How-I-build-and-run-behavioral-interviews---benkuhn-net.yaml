    was too easy for candidates to bullshit them and too hard for me to tell what
    was a good answer. I’d end up grading every candidate as an “okay, I guess” because
    I was never sure what bar I should hold them to.

    you’ll only give 4 times. But it’s worth it! Your most limited resource is time
    with candidates, so if you can spend more of your own time to use candidates’
    time better, that’s worth it.

    and what follow-up questions you’ll ask to assess those things. This will help
    you deliver the interview consistently, but most importantly, you’ll ask much
    better follow-up questions if you’ve thought about them beforehand. See [the appendix](#appendix-example-rubric)
    for an example rubric.

    culture to candidates, and holding a high bar for job candidate experience.

    the best way is to get them to tell you a lot of details about the situation—the
    more you get them to tell you, the harder it will be to BS all the details.
