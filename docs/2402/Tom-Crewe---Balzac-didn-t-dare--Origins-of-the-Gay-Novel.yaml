    We are made suddenly aware of him, standing in sharp relief against the busy background,
    apparently having very little to do with it. Usually, we see him just for a moment.
    Often we do not trust ourselves: we do a double-take. Occasionally, there is a
    flash of recognition. ‘It seemed to me,’ Henry James wrote to the critic and campaigner
    for homosexual rights John Addington Symonds in 1884, ‘that the victims of a common
    passion should sometimes exchange a look.’ The common passion James referred to
    was for Italy – or was it?'

    Jane Austen gave Mary Crawford is about sodomy, well known to be a feature of
    naval life. Some critics have argued reasonably that it isn’t, that the emphasis
    of the pun rests on ‘*Vices*’ (Mary’s uncle, an admiral, has moved his mistress
    into his household). What we do know for certain is that Edmund and Fanny are
    very shocked. They are very shockable people, admittedly, but would they be quite
    so appalled by Mary’s indiscretion if it pertained only to a mistress? Other characters
    in Austen’s books are relaxed about discussing similarly dubious subjects, such
    as ‘natural children’ (*Emma* is unimaginable without one such product of ‘vice’,
    Harriet Smith). Either way, Austen must have been aware of the possibility she
    was leaving open. The historian Seth Stein LeJacq has calculated that her brothers
    Francis and Charles, both of whom became admirals, served on at least ten naval
    sodomy trials between them, eight of these before *Mansfield Park* was published.
    And she wasn’t too delicate to risk such an allusion. Many years after Austen’s
    death, her favourite niece, Fanny, wrote to her sister: ‘Aunt Jane … was not so
    *refined* as she ought to have been from her *talent*, and if she had lived fifty
    years later she would have been in many respects more suitable.’'

    butt of the joke. He is a source of scandal, trespassing beyond the boundaries
    of decency or authority. In Austen he is a vulgarity; in Tolstoy, Eça and Alas,
    he is a grotesque. Yet he is also taken for granted, prominent enough to achieve
    his small representation, however unflattering, in the society shown in the novel.
    In all four, the gay man is a marginal figure, strictly irrelevant to the main
    action. Yet in each case, he belongs to a non-marginal institution. In Austen,
    the navy, at a time of war. In Tolstoy, the army, bulwark of the tsar. In Eça

    it was around this time that gay men (and women) found themselves at last becoming
    a source of great interest and discussion. The emergent sciences of psychology,
    criminology and sexology focused significant attention on homosexuality (or ‘inversion’)
    as a human peculiarity in need of explanation, and the most up-to-date work suggested
    that it might be an inherited disease. In these circumstances, it is unsurprising
    that gay readers wishing to see themselves represented in the novel would have
    turned to Émile Zola, who had become famous for his determination, in his huge
    cycle of interconnected novels, to represent society in its darkest and bleakest
    aspects, and for his supposedly ‘scientific’ approach to his characters, whose

    offering as it does a model form of ‘coming out’: first a tortured dialogue between
    body and mind during childhood and adolescence, then reciprocated sexual attraction,
    clandestine first kisses and sexual acts, a developing confidence, and at last
    the act of confession in the writing of the ‘human documents’ we are reading.
    This is the reason the Italian’s letter reads much more like a novel to us now
    than it did to him then.'

- en: 'It​ is not a coincidence that in the last two decades of the 19th century,
    as the invert case study put gay lives into print for the first time, we begin
    to see the first novels that, rather than including gay characters within Zola-style
    social narratives (as the Italian wanted), are instead *about* homosexuality,
    or, more accurately, about the condition of being a homosexual. There weren’t
    very many of these books, and most are long forgotten. But already, as Graham
    Robb observed in *Strangers*, his study of homosexuality in the 19th century,
    the trope of the ‘gay tragic ending’ was in evidence: ‘In twelve European and
    American novels (1875-1901) in which the main character is depicted, often sympathetically,
    as an adult homosexual man, six die (disease, unrequited love and three suicides),
    two are murdered, one goes mad, one is cured by marriage and two end happily (one
    after six months in prison and emigration to the US).’ As Robb says, it cannot
    only be that authors felt they had to inflict punishment on their characters,
    as a way of redeeming their text in the eyes of the censor. The tragic death was
    a strategy: by showing a doom to which gay men were fated, they were arguing against
    the society that made it inevitable. The logic of the case study lurks here too:
    the uncertain tone of the Italian’s confessions, which veer between self-hatred,
    extravagant descriptions of himself as a monstrosity, and a frank acceptance of
    his nature and the pleasure he has found, is suggestive of the ways in which the
    ‘tragedy’ of being gay might be played up, not always consciously, as part of
    the bid for toleration and understanding.'

    novels by gay men. Wilde’s *Dorian Gray*, for example, with its progression from
    innocence to corruption, and symbol of the unadmitted life. Certainly Forster’s
    *Maurice*, which begins with its hero at the troubled age of fourteen and ends
    (happily for once) with his escape with his lover. *À la recherche du temps perdu*
    proposes itself as the narrated career of a heterosexual, but is again an autobiographical
    account of a maturing sexuality which pertains very largely to the habits and
    love affairs of homosexuals. Melville’s ‘Billy Budd’ and D.H. Lawrence’s ‘The
    Prussian Officer’ are oddly similar – oddly, because Lawrence didn’t know Melville’s
    story – in that they both depict an older man’s unarticulated, obscure but angry
    passion for a younger subordinate, and both end in the younger causing the older
    man’s death, before dying himself. These stories could be read as ‘homosexual’
    only in light of knowledge of the sort collected by the case study, which allowed
    the informed reader to extrapolate from external signs to internal states of feeling.
    Most of all – and perhaps most unexpectedly, considering the distance of time
    travelled – the case study underlies the major tradition of gay writing that developed
    after 1945 and that persists to the present day, the often melancholic or tragic
    novels of individual struggle, of childhood and adolescent experience, of attempted
    repression, of searching, of sexual experiment and release: from Gore Vidal’s
    *The City and the Pillar* to James Baldwin’s *Giovanni’s Room*, to Edmund White’s
    *A **Boy’s Own Story* to Annie Proulx’s ‘Brokeback Mountain’ to Garth Greenwell’s
    *What Belongs to You* to Édouard Louis’s *The End of Eddy* to Alice Oseman’s *Heartstopper*.
    Those novels that largely or entirely concern themselves with gay male characters
    – such as Alan Hollinghurst’s *The Swimming-Pool Library*, which has no women
    in it – also have a relationship to the case study, which, especially once it
    concerns the subject’s adulthood, essentially limits itself to describing his
    interactions with men of his own kind.'

    in part because the experiences of young gay men have remained sadly familiar
    (and because at certain points, gay men’s worlds were forced to become extremely
    homosocial). Indeed, although in most parts of the West ‘coming out’ may now be
    easier than it has ever been, there seems to be a renewed enthusiasm for publishing
    narratives about the discovery and affirmation of our identity. But we should
    recognise that the long, largely undetected influence of the case study has also
    kept gay life, as represented in the novel, on the margins, rendered it exceptional,
    isolated it, centred it on sexual desire and the problem of its fulfilment, made
    of it a type of sentimental plea. In his preface to Saint-Paul’s study, Zola concluded
    with a tentative hope that the publication of the ‘Novel of an Invert’

    And then, everything related to sex is related to society itself. An invert is
    a disruptor of the family, the nation, and humanity*.* Man and Woman are surely
    here on earth only in order to have children, and they destroy life the day when
    they no longer do what they must.

- en: 'Though Zola didn’t intend it, this passage contains a rallying cry for a different
    kind of gay or queer fiction. His point is, in a way, obvious: sexuality relates
    intimately to the way we live in society, and when society is constructed on heterosexual
    lines, this means that the homosexual is capable of disrupting every element of
    it. Yet by failing to outgrow the individualising shadow of the case study, gay
    or queer fiction has not fully reckoned with this, and not fully reckoned with
    huge areas of social experience. The requirement to lift our sights – to see gay
    lives as they interact with, to use Zola’s words, family, nation, humanity – is
    especially pressing if we are dealing with the past, when society was culturally
    and legally premised on heterosexuality to an extent no longer possible here (though
    still the case in many non-Western countries). To write about gay men in Britain
    in the 19th century, for example, should be to write about them as sons, brothers,
    friends, lovers, husbands, fathers, grandparents, members of a social class, employees,
    employers, thinkers, readers, politicians, imperialists and so on; as part of
    the world, not as apart from it. To return to Forster’s definitions, this would
    be to take gay men out of story and put them into plot; to turn them from ‘flat’
    characters, with one dominating trait, into ‘round’ ones. This does not mean that
    we should minimise sexuality – rather, we would see its significance more clearly,
    as it disrupts, or perhaps doesn’t, in all areas of life; in so doing, we would
    see the society more clearly also. The same can be done in novels about the present:
    to live up to the full ambition of the idea of ‘queering’ – as disruption – we
    need to see a queer individual in the full spectrum of their relationships with
    people, places, institutions. To keep our exploration within the bounds of identity
    is to conspire in our own limitation.'

    of their time, what they wanted was not for the gay man to be separated from the
    main current of the novel, but to be placed, by act of imagination, definitely
    and inevitably within it, in modern life, in society itself. They are waiting
    still.
