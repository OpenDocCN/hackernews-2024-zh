    We are made suddenly aware of him, standing in sharp relief against the busy background,

    Often we do not trust ourselves: we do a double-take. Occasionally, there is a
    flash of recognition. ‘It seemed to me,’ Henry James wrote to the critic and campaigner
    for homosexual rights John Addington Symonds in 1884, ‘that the victims of a common
    passion should sometimes exchange a look.’ The common passion James referred to

- en: 'Rear and vice are different kinds of admiral, and we might think that the pun
    Jane Austen gave Mary Crawford is about sodomy, well known to be a feature of
    naval life. Some critics have argued reasonably that it isn’t, that the emphasis
    of the pun rests on ‘*Vices*’ (Mary’s uncle, an admiral, has moved his mistress
    into his household). What we do know for certain is that Edmund and Fanny are
    very shocked. They are very shockable people, admittedly, but would they be quite
    so appalled by Mary’s indiscretion if it pertained only to a mistress? Other characters
    in Austen’s books are relaxed about discussing similarly dubious subjects, such
    as ‘natural children’ (*Emma* is unimaginable without one such product of ‘vice’,
    Harriet Smith). Either way, Austen must have been aware of the possibility she
    was leaving open. The historian Seth Stein LeJacq has calculated that her brothers
    Francis and Charles, both of whom became admirals, served on at least ten naval
    sodomy trials between them, eight of these before *Mansfield Park* was published.
    And she wasn’t too delicate to risk such an allusion. Many years after Austen’s
    death, her favourite niece, Fanny, wrote to her sister: ‘Aunt Jane … was not so
    *refined* as she ought to have been from her *talent*, and if she had lived fifty
    years later she would have been in many respects more suitable.’'

    In all four, the gay man is a marginal figure, strictly irrelevant to the main
    action. Yet in each case, he belongs to a non-marginal institution. In Austen,
    the navy, at a time of war. In Tolstoy, the army, bulwark of the tsar. In Eça

    as the invert case study put gay lives into print for the first time, we begin
    to see the first novels that, rather than including gay characters within Zola-style
    social narratives (as the Italian wanted), are instead *about* homosexuality,
    or, more accurately, about the condition of being a homosexual. There weren’t
    very many of these books, and most are long forgotten. But already, as Graham
    Robb observed in *Strangers*, his study of homosexuality in the 19th century,
    the trope of the ‘gay tragic ending’ was in evidence: ‘In twelve European and
    American novels (1875-1901) in which the main character is depicted, often sympathetically,
    as an adult homosexual man, six die (disease, unrequited love and three suicides),
    two are murdered, one goes mad, one is cured by marriage and two end happily (one
    after six months in prison and emigration to the US).’ As Robb says, it cannot
    only be that authors felt they had to inflict punishment on their characters,
    as a way of redeeming their text in the eyes of the censor. The tragic death was
    a strategy: by showing a doom to which gay men were fated, they were arguing against
    the society that made it inevitable. The logic of the case study lurks here too:
    the uncertain tone of the Italian’s confessions, which veer between self-hatred,
    extravagant descriptions of himself as a monstrosity, and a frank acceptance of
    his nature and the pleasure he has found, is suggestive of the ways in which the
    ‘tragedy’ of being gay might be played up, not always consciously, as part of
    the bid for toleration and understanding.'

  zh: 在19世纪末的最后二十年里，把同性恋生活首次公之于众的倒装案例研究成为一种偶然现象并不是巧合。我们开始看到首批小说，这些小说不再像意大利人所希望的那样在祖拉式社会叙事中描绘同性恋角色，而是*关于*同性恋，或者更准确地说，是关于同性恋者的状态。这些书并不多，大多数早已被遗忘。但正如格雷厄姆·罗布在他关于19世纪同性恋研究的书《陌生人》中所观察到的那样，‘同性恋悲剧结局’的模式已经显现出来：‘在十二部描绘成年同性恋男性主角（1875-1901）的欧美小说中，他们大多数被描绘得令人同情，但其中六人死亡（疾病、单相思和三次自杀），两人被谋杀，一人疯了，一人通过婚姻被治愈，还有两人结局幸福（其中一人在坐牢六个月后移居美国）。’正如罗布所说，作者们不仅仅是因为要在审查者眼中挽回自己的文本而施加惩罚于他们的角色。悲剧性的死亡是一种策略：通过展示同性恋者所注定的命运，他们在反对那个让这种命运变得不可避免的社会。案例研究的逻辑也在此潜藏：意大利人在自己的自白中表现出的不确定性语调，他在自我厌恶、把自己描述为怪物以及坦然接受自己天性和所获快乐之间摇摆不定，显示出了同性恋‘悲剧’可能被夸大的方式，这并非总是有意的，而是作为容忍和理解的努力的一部分。
- en: 'The case study also underlies other, more canonical late 19th and early 20th-century
    novels by gay men. Wilde’s *Dorian Gray*, for example, with its progression from
    innocence to corruption, and symbol of the unadmitted life. Certainly Forster’s
    *Maurice*, which begins with its hero at the troubled age of fourteen and ends
    (happily for once) with his escape with his lover. *À la recherche du temps perdu*
    proposes itself as the narrated career of a heterosexual, but is again an autobiographical
    account of a maturing sexuality which pertains very largely to the habits and
    love affairs of homosexuals. Melville’s ‘Billy Budd’ and D.H. Lawrence’s ‘The
    Prussian Officer’ are oddly similar – oddly, because Lawrence didn’t know Melville’s
    story – in that they both depict an older man’s unarticulated, obscure but angry
    passion for a younger subordinate, and both end in the younger causing the older
    man’s death, before dying himself. These stories could be read as ‘homosexual’
    only in light of knowledge of the sort collected by the case study, which allowed
    the informed reader to extrapolate from external signs to internal states of feeling.
    Most of all – and perhaps most unexpectedly, considering the distance of time
    travelled – the case study underlies the major tradition of gay writing that developed
    after 1945 and that persists to the present day, the often melancholic or tragic
    novels of individual struggle, of childhood and adolescent experience, of attempted
    repression, of searching, of sexual experiment and release: from Gore Vidal’s
    *The City and the Pillar* to James Baldwin’s *Giovanni’s Room*, to Edmund White’s
    *A **Boy’s Own Story* to Annie Proulx’s ‘Brokeback Mountain’ to Garth Greenwell’s
    *What Belongs to You* to Édouard Louis’s *The End of Eddy* to Alice Oseman’s *Heartstopper*.
    Those novels that largely or entirely concern themselves with gay male characters
    – such as Alan Hollinghurst’s *The Swimming-Pool Library*, which has no women
    in it – also have a relationship to the case study, which, especially once it
    concerns the subject’s adulthood, essentially limits itself to describing his

    Budd’和D.H.劳伦斯的‘The Prussian Officer’同样奇怪地相似——奇怪的是，因为劳伦斯不知道梅尔维尔的故事——因为它们都描绘了一个年长男子对年轻下属的无言、模糊但愤怒的激情，并且两者都以年轻人导致年长男子死亡，然后自己死亡结束。只有在了解案例研究收集到的这种知识的光照下，这些故事才能被视为‘同性恋’，允许知情读者从外部迹象推断内心感情状态。最重要的是——也许最出乎意料的是，考虑到所经历的时间距离——该案例研究潜在地支持了1945年后发展起来并持续至今的同性恋写作的主要传统，这些小说通常是关于个人奋斗、童年和青少年经历、试图的压抑、探索、性实验和释放的悲观或悲剧性小说：从戈尔·维达尔的*The
    City and the Pillar*到詹姆斯·鲍德温的*Giovanni's Room*，再到爱德蒙·怀特的*A **Boy's Own Story*，安妮·普鲁的‘Brokeback

    lines, this means that the homosexual is capable of disrupting every element of
    it. Yet by failing to outgrow the individualising shadow of the case study, gay
    or queer fiction has not fully reckoned with this, and not fully reckoned with
    huge areas of social experience. The requirement to lift our sights – to see gay
    lives as they interact with, to use Zola’s words, family, nation, humanity – is
    especially pressing if we are dealing with the past, when society was culturally
    and legally premised on heterosexuality to an extent no longer possible here (though
    still the case in many non-Western countries). To write about gay men in Britain
    in the 19th century, for example, should be to write about them as sons, brothers,
    friends, lovers, husbands, fathers, grandparents, members of a social class, employees,
    employers, thinkers, readers, politicians, imperialists and so on; as part of
    the world, not as apart from it. To return to Forster’s definitions, this would
    be to take gay men out of story and put them into plot; to turn them from ‘flat’
    characters, with one dominating trait, into ‘round’ ones. This does not mean that
    we should minimise sexuality – rather, we would see its significance more clearly,
    as it disrupts, or perhaps doesn’t, in all areas of life; in so doing, we would
    see the society more clearly also. The same can be done in novels about the present:
    to live up to the full ambition of the idea of ‘queering’ – as disruption – we
    need to see a queer individual in the full spectrum of their relationships with
    people, places, institutions. To keep our exploration within the bounds of identity
    is to conspire in our own limitation.'

  zh: 尽管佐拉并非有意，但这段文字却包含了一种不同类型的同性恋或酷儿小说的集结呼声。他的观点在某种程度上显而易见：性取向与我们在社会中生活的方式密切相关，当社会建立在异性恋的基础上时，这意味着同性恋者有能力颠覆其中的每一个元素。然而，通过未能超越案例研究的个体化阴影，同性恋或酷儿小说尚未完全应对此情况，也未能完全应对社会经验的广阔领域。如果我们处理的是过去，当时的社会在文化和法律上更多地基于异性恋，这种要求尤为紧迫（尽管在许多非西方国家仍然如此）。例如，写关于19世纪英国的同性恋男性，应当写他们作为儿子、兄弟、朋友、情人、丈夫、父亲、祖父、社会阶层的一员、雇员、雇主、思想家、读者、政治家、帝国主义者等等；作为世界的一部分，而不是与之隔绝。回到福斯特的定义，这意味着把同性恋男性从故事中抽离，置于情节之中；把他们从具有一个主导特征的“平面”角色转变为“圆润”的角色。这并不意味着我们应该淡化性取向——相反，我们将更清楚地看到它在生活的各个领域中的重要性，它是如何颠覆或者也许并未颠覆的；通过这样做，我们也将更清晰地看到社会。在关于现在的小说中也可以做同样的事情：为了实现“酷儿化”的全面抱负——作为一种颠覆——我们需要看到一个酷儿个体在与人、地方、机构的全部关系中的全谱。如果我们将探索局限在身份的界限内，那就是合谋我们自己的限制。
- en: When Symonds and the Italian wrote to Zola, the most famous and ambitious novelist
    of their time, what they wanted was not for the gay man to be separated from the
    main current of the novel, but to be placed, by act of imagination, definitely
    and inevitably within it, in modern life, in society itself. They are waiting
    still.

  zh: 当 Symonds 和这位意大利作家写信给佐拉时，他们所期望的并非要把同性恋者从小说的主流中分离出来，而是通过想象力的行动，将其明确且不可避免地置于现代生活和社会本身之中。他们至今仍在等待。
