    do this. ADB is a lighting technology that has been available for many years in
    other parts of the world including Europe, China and Canada, but not in the United
    States.

    it all over the road. If there’s a car coming in the other direction, or one driving
    ahead in the same lane, the light stays precisely away from that vehicle. The
    rest of the road is still covered in bright light with just a pocket of dimmer
    light around the other vehicles. This way a deer, pedestrian or bicyclist by the
    side of the road can still be seen clearly while other drivers sharing the road
    can see, too.

    feature available on many new cars that automatically flicks off the high beams
    if another vehicle is detected ahead. But that still means driving much – or most
    – of the time using only low beam headlights that don’t reach very far. That can
    be dangerous.

- en: US auto safety regulations enacted in 2022 were supposed to finally allow ADB
    headlight, something for which the auto industry and safety groups had long been
    asking for. But, according to automakers and safety advocates, the new rules make
    it difficult for automakers to add the feature. That means it will probably be
    years before ADB headlights are widely available in the US.

    just lack the software to perform the way they were designed to. Some American
    Mercedes drivers can enjoy a dazzling light display as they start up or shut off
    their cars at night. Moving streaks of light wash across the pavement or walls
    in front of the car like a glittering snowstorm. But, while driving, the lights
    work just like standard high beam, low beam headlights. Their adaptive capabilities
    aren’t enabled here because they still don’t meet US rules.

    pixels to project light patterns on the road. Even in the US, some Mercedes vehicles
    can project symbols like arrows or lines on the road to guide drivers. Less expensive
    systems in Europe and Asia use several thousand or even fewer light emitters,
    reflectors or shutter systems to create adaptive beams,

    simply didn’t allow for adaptive headlight technology at all. Light beams wrapping
    around other vehicles just wasn’t something the regulations could encompass so
    the technology wasn’t allowed here by default.

- en: That changed in early 2022 when, after a decade of work on it, America’s National
    Highway Traffic Safety Administration finalized regulations for adaptive beam
    headlights. But because the US regulations are so different from those in other
    countries, with requirements so difficult to meet, automakers still can’t offer
    it here. It will be years before they can offer new, redesigned ADB headlights
    that meet the standards, auto industry sources say.

    detecting another vehicle within reach of the lights, much faster than other standards

    drivers. Glare has been a particular concern for many years since new vehicles
    have brighter headlights that can sometimes cause discomfort or even temporarily
    blind other drivers. Many in the industry say the regulations overemphasize that
    concern, though, holding adaptive beam headlights to even higher standards than
    regular headlights when it comes to glare reduction.

  zh: NHTSA法规优先考虑减少任何可能导致其他驾驶员眩光的潜力。多年来，眩光一直是一个特别关注的问题，因为新车的前照灯更亮，有时会导致其他驾驶员的不适甚至短暂失明。行业内许多人士称，这些法规过分强调了这一问题，认为在减少眩光方面，自适应束前照灯比普通前照灯的标准更高。
