    applications, giving anyone running Windows 11 on unsupported hardware a glimpse
    of their potential future.

- en: Microsoft regularly updates Windows' inbox apps via its Store. Rather than wait
    for a release of the operating system, it can push out fixes and features as and
    when they are ready. Apps such as the Calendar, Photos, and Calculator were given
    just such an update in January, and this broke them for many Windows 10 users.

    then started on the company's support forums as users found apps that had previously
    worked suddenly began failing. Users reported that their attempts to open photos
    from Explorer were met with errors, issues with the Calculator, and so on. Even
    a reinstall of Windows 10 didn't bring relief.

    of an official comment from Microsoft, those affected did some detective work
    to figure out what had befallen their previously working instances.

    processors have featured in some of the reports, as well as some AMD Athlon chips.
    The Core 2 line first turned up in 2006 and, while not on the [list of officially
    supported processors](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/design/minimum/supported/windows-10-22h2-supported-intel-processors)
    for Windows 10, the processor had more than enough oomph for many productivity
    tasks, until now.

    is that the faulting component uses some instruction extension that Core 2 doesn''t

    to force customers to buy new hardware, cock-up rather than conspiracy seems more
    likely. Our reader noted: "I believe that some dev at MS set a compiler switch
    incorrectly when building a shared component (some evidence points to the Visual
    C++ runtime)."'

    doubts the company does much in the way of regression testing on unsupported hardware.
    A cynic might go as far as saying it has enough difficulty with quality when it
    comes to the kit that it *does* support.

    in the long term is problematic and, if a vulnerability requires fixing, potentially
    dangerous.

    pause for thought to those Windows 11 fans who have managed to get the latest
    version of Microsoft's operating system running on unsupported hardware. If the
    company can inadvertently pull the rug from beneath Windows 10 users on outdated
    chips, the same thing could just as easily happen to them.
