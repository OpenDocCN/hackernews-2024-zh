- en: In a [complaint filed in 2018](/news-events/news/press-releases/2018/11/ftc-halts-purveyors-sham-health-insurance-plans),
    the FTC said that Florida-based Simple Health misled people into thinking they
    were buying comprehensive health insurance that would cover preexisting medical
    conditions, prescription drugs, primary and specialty care treatment, inpatient
    and emergency hospital care, surgical procedures, and medical and laboratory testing.
    In reality, most consumers who enrolled reported paying as much as $500 per month
    for what was actually a medical discount program or extremely limited benefit
    program that did not deliver the promised benefits and often left consumers with
    thousands of dollars in uncovered medical bills, or worse yet, unable to get necessary
    healthcare.

    Health公司误导消费者，使他们误以为购买的是全面的健康保险，覆盖现有医疗条件、处方药、初级和专科治疗、住院和急诊医院治疗、手术程序以及医疗和实验室检测。实际上，大多数注册的消费者报告称他们每月支付高达500美元，实际上却只是医疗折扣计划或极为有限的福利计划，未能提供承诺的福利，往往使消费者面临数千美元的未覆盖医疗费用，甚至无法获得必要的医疗服务。
