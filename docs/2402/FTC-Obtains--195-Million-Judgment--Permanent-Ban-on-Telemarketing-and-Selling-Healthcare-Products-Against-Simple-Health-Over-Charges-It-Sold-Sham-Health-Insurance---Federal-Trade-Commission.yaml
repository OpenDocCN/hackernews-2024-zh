    that cost them thousands of dollars for ‘benefits’ that in fact left consumers
    unprotected,” said Samuel Levine, Director of the FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection.
    “We are pleased the court recognized this blatant bait and switch and ordered
    the company and its CEO to turn over the money they bilked from consumers.”

- en: In a [complaint filed in 2018](/news-events/news/press-releases/2018/11/ftc-halts-purveyors-sham-health-insurance-plans),
    the FTC said that Florida-based Simple Health misled people into thinking they
    were buying comprehensive health insurance that would cover preexisting medical
    conditions, prescription drugs, primary and specialty care treatment, inpatient
    and emergency hospital care, surgical procedures, and medical and laboratory testing.
    In reality, most consumers who enrolled reported paying as much as $500 per month
    for what was actually a medical discount program or extremely limited benefit
    program that did not deliver the promised benefits and often left consumers with
    thousands of dollars in uncovered medical bills, or worse yet, unable to get necessary
    healthcare.

    2018, be liquidated and all the proceeds be turned over to the FTC, which is expected
    to use the money to provide refunds to consumers. In addition to the banned conduct,
    the order also prohibits any misrepresentations in the sale of any good or service.
    The defendants also are prohibited from collecting any money for any healthcare
    product they previously sold and are required to destroy any personal information
