The **New Model M** buckling spring keyboard has the same mechanism, feel and layout as the original IBM Model M keyboard, but with a slightly smaller footprint. With the much-loved buckling spring key design these keyboards have been prized by computer enthusiasts and robust typists because of the tactile and auditory feedback of each keystroke.

Manufactured in Lexington, Kentucky, our buckling spring keyboard is a heavy, audible keyboard with a gorgeous finish and solid feel reminiscent of the classic IBM Model M keyboard.

**Buckling Springs**

Buckling springs originated in IBM’s mechanical keyboard as a fundamentally different kind of switch mechanism. Featuring a coil spring that sits between the keycap and a pivoting hammer that collapses when clicked, the spring provides a loud, tactile feedback.

**Model M-Inspired Keycaps**

The two-tone white and gray buckling spring keys are made of PBT polymer. The dye-sublimated legends compliment the authentic feel and classic design. The keys are also available in all gray or all white.
