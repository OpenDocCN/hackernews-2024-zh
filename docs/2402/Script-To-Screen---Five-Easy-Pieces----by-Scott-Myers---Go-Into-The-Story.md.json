["```\n **INT. ROADSIDE CAFE - DAY** \t\tAll four are seated at a booth. The women have\n\t\tgiven their orders and a WAITRESS stands above\n\t\tBobby, waiting for his:\n **BOBBY** \t\t\t\t(looking at his menu)\n\t\t\tI'll have an omelette, no potatoes.\n\t\t\tGive me tomatoes instead, and wheat\n\t\t\ttoast instead of rolls.\n\t\tThe waitress indicates something on the menu with\n\t\tthe butt of her pencil.\n **WAITRESS** \t\t\tNo substitutions.\n **BOBBY** \t\t\tWhat does that mean? You don't have\n\t\t\tany tomatoes?\n **WAITRESS** \t\t\t\t(annoyed)\n\t\t\tNo. We have tomatoes.\n **BOBBY** \t\t\tBut I can't have any. Is that what\n\t\t\tyou mean?\n **WAITRESS** \t\t\tOnly what's on the menu...\n\t\t\t\t(again, indicating  with\n\t\t\t\ther pencil)\n\t\t\tA Number Two: Plain omelette. It\n\t\t\tcomes with cottage fries and rolls.\n **BOBBY** \t\t\tI know what it comes with, but\n\t\t\tthat's not what I want.\n **WAITRESS** \t\t\tI'll come back when you've made up\n\t\t\tyour mind...\n\t\tShe starts to move away and Bobby detains her.\n **BOBBY** \t\t\tWait, I've made up my mind. I want\n\t\t\ta plain omelette, forget the\n\t\t\ttomatoes, don't put potatoes on the\n\t\t\tplate, and give me a side of wheat\n\t\t\ttoast and a cup of coffee.\n **WAITRESS** \t\t\tI'm sorry, we don't have side\n\t\t\torders of toast. I can give you an\n\t\t\tEnglish muffin or a coffee roll.\n **BOBBY** \t\t\tWhat do you mean, you don't have\n\t\t\tside orders of toast? You make\n\t\t\tsandwiches, don't you?\n **WAITRESS** \t\t\tWould you like to talk to the\n\t\t\tmanager?\n **PALM** \t\t\tHey, mack!\n **BOBBY** \t\t\t\t(to Palm)\n\t\t\tShut up.\n\t\t\t\t(to the waitress)\n\t\t\tYou have bread, don't you, and a\n\t\t\ttoaster of some kind?\n **WAITRESS** \t\t\tI don't make the rules.\n **BOBBY** \t\t\tOkay, I'll make it as easy for you\n\t\t\tas I can. Give me an omelette,\n\t\t\tplain, and a chicken salad sandwich\n\t\t\ton wheat toast -- no butter, no\n\t\t\tmayonnaise, no lettuce -- and a cup\n\t\t\tof coffee.\n\t\tShe begins writing down his order, repeating it\n\t\tsarcastically:\n **WAITRESS** \t\t\tOne Number Two, and a chicken sal\n\t\t\tsan -- hold the butter, the mayo,\n\t\t\tthe lettuce -- and a cup of\n\t\t\tcoffee... Anything else?\n **BOBBY** \t\t\tNow all you have to do is hold the\n\t\t\tchicken, bring me the toast, charge\n\t\t\tme for the sandwich, and you\n\t\t\thaven't broken any rules.\n **WAITRESS** \t\t\t\t(challenging him)\n\t\t\tYou want me to hold the chicken.\n **BOBBY** \t\t\tYeah. I want you to hold it between\n\t\t\tyour knees.\n\t\tThe other three laugh, and the waitress points to a\n\t\t\"Right to Refuse\" sign above the counter.\n **WAITRESS** \t\t\tYou see that sign, sir?!\n\t\tBobby glances over at it, then back to her.\n **WAITRESS (CONT'D)** \t\t\tYou'll all have to leave, I'm not\n\t\t\ttaking any more of your smartness\n\t\t\tand your sarcasm!\n\t\tHe smiles politely at her, then:\n **BOBBY** \t\t\tYou see this sign?\n\t\tHe reaches his arm out and \"clears\" the table for\n\t\ther.\n```"]
