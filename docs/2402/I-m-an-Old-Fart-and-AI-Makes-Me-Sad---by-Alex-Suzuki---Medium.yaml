- en: PCs were my gateway drug into technology — they got me into gaming and eventually
    programming. I have fond memories using tools like MEMMAKER to squeeze more memory
    from my machine just so I could run a pirated copy of some new game on my DOS
    box.

    were sold by different vendors. You were mostly free to do what you wanted with
    these machines. You could swap out parts. You could run games, you could write
    software, or do something totally different with them.

    With some skill and dedication, you could even build your own.

    protocols like TCP/IP, HTTP, SMTP etc. You could buy a book or visit SELFHTML,
    open an account at Geocities and create a website. If Geocities went down, you
    could move your website somewhere else, or even self-host. No single company or
    entity owned a significant chunk of the Internet.

    of papers I’d have to read and mathematics that I’d have to ingest to really understand
    why a certain prompt X results in a certain output Y feels overwhelming. Even
    some top scientists in the field admit that we don’t really understand how AI
    works.

    data. If those are no longer available, I’ll use another relational database,
    key-value store, distributed filesystem, whatever. But what if OpenAI decides
    to revoke access to that API feature I’m using? What if they change pricing and
    make it uneconomical to run? What if OpenAI extends their offering and makes my
    product redundant?
