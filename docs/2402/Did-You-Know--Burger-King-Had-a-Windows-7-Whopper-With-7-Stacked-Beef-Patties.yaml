    especially since it launched after the Windows Vista disaster, so the company
    just had to make sure everything was flawless.**'

    across the world to celebrate the launch of Windows 7, including with fast food
    network Burger King.

- en: In case you’re wondering what fast food had in common with technology, in general,
    and Windows 7, in particular, the answer comes down to the so-called Windows 7
    Whopper.

- en: Launched exclusively in Japan, the Burger King’s special whopper was a way to
    celebrate the debut of Windows 7, so it used not one, not two, not three (you
    get the point), but seven separate stacked beef patties. Obviously, the choice
    of seven patties isn’t a coincidence, as Burger King used this as a magic number
    for everything regarding this whooper.

- en: For example, it was sold for ¥777 (a little over $8.50 at that time) and was
    supposed to be available for just seven days after going on sale for the first
    time. Burger King, however, eventually decided to keep it around for a little
    longer since it was super-successful, so the Windows 7 Whopper was available until
    November 6.

- en: The burger measured no less than 5 inches (13 centimeters) in height and tipped
    the scales at 1 kg (2.2 lb), so it was quite a meal. It had more than 1,000 kcal
    given the seven stacked beef patties.

- en: Just like Windows 7 itself, the Windows 7 Whopper eventually became super-successful,
    with Burger King selling no less than 6,000 sandwiches in the first four days.
    This is actually one of the reasons the fast food chain eventually decided to
    continue selling the whopper until early November, as it became not only a local
    trend, but also an Internet sensation, as everyone talked about it on blogs and
    in YouTube videos.

- en: Because of the high demand for the whopper, some Burger King restaurants were
    selling the Windows 7 whopper at the ¥777 price only to the first 30 customers
    each day. Afterwards, the price increased to ¥1,450 (about $17).

    by Microsoft, and there’s no doubt all these marketing campaigns played a key
    role in this.

- en: Microsoft stopped shipped updates for Windows 7 earlier this year, and now the
    2009 operating system is officially an unsupported product, which means that devices
    still running it won’t be provided with patches and security fixes no matter what.
    Of course, this doesn’t necessarily mean that everyone jumped ship and, despite
    the obvious risks, Windows 7 is still running on some 25 percent of the world’s
    computers, according to third-party data.

  zh: 今年早些时候，微软停止为Windows 7提供更新，这款2009年的操作系统现在已正式成为不支持的产品，这意味着仍在运行它的设备将不会获得补丁和安全修复程序。当然，这并不一定意味着所有人都放弃了Windows
    7，尽管存在明显的风险，据第三方数据显示，全球约有25%的电脑仍在运行该系统。
- en: This means that 1 in 4 desktops out there are still on Windows 7, and in spite
    of Microsoft’s efforts to convince everyone to upgrade to Windows 10, there’s
    a good chance an en-masse transition wouldn’t happen too soon.

  zh: 这意味着，四分之一的桌面电脑仍在使用Windows 7，尽管微软努力说服每个人升级到Windows 10，但集体过渡可能不会太快发生。
- en: Many stick with Windows 7 thanks to its familiar desktop approach, as they feel
    that the modern system in Windows 10, which includes features like touch and a
    Microsoft Store app, is too cluttered and doesn’t make sense for a traditional
    PC. Whether or not this would change is something that remains to be seen, but
    right now, both the Burger King Windows 7 Whopper and Windows 7 itself are only
    history and there’s no way to bring them back.

  zh: 许多人坚持使用Windows 7，因为它采用了熟悉的桌面方式，他们觉得Windows 10中的现代系统（包括触摸和Microsoft Store应用等功能）过于混乱，对传统PC没有意义。这是否会改变还有待观察，但目前，汉堡王的Windows
    7 Whopper和Windows 7本身已经成为历史，无法重现。
