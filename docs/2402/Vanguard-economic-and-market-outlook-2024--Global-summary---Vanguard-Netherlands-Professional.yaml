- en: '**Notes:** Forecasts are as at 14 November 2023\. For the US, GDP growth is
    defined as the year-over-year change in fourth-quarter GDP. For all other countries/regions,
    GDP growth is defined as the annual change in GDP in the forecast year compared
    with the previous year. Unemployment forecasts are the average for the fourth
    quarter of 2024\. NAIRU is the non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment,
    a measure of labour market equilibrium. Core inflation excludes volatile food
    and energy prices. For the US, euro area and UK, core inflation is defined as
    the year-over-year change in the fourth quarter compared with the previous year.
    For China, core inflation is defined as the average annual change compared with
    the previous year. For the US, core inflation is based on the core Personal Consumption
    Expenditures Index. For all other countries/regions, core inflation is based on
    the core Consumer Price Index. The neutral rate is the equilibrium policy rate
    at which no easing or tightening pressures are being placed upon an economy or
    its financial markets.'

- en: Despite the potential for near-term volatility, we believe this rise in interest
    rates is the single best economic and financial development in 20 years for long-term
    investors. Our bond return expectations have increased substantially. We now expect
    euro area bonds to return a nominal annualised 2.9%–3.9% over the next decade,
    compared with the -0.5%-0.5% annualised returns we expected before the rate-hiking
    cycle began. Similarly, for hedged global ex-euro area bonds, we expect annualised
    returns of 2.8%-3.8% over the next decade, compared with a forecast of -0.5%-0.5%
    when policy rates were low or, in some cases, negative.

    eventually more than offset the capital losses experienced over the last two years.
    By the end of the decade, bond portfolio values are expected to be higher than
    if rates had not increased in the first place.

    Long-term investors in balanced portfolios have seen a dramatic rise in the probability
    of achieving a 10-year annualised return of at least 5%, from close to a 0% likelihood
    in 2021 to 44% today.

- en: A higher-rate environment depresses asset price valuations across global markets
    while squeezing profit margins as corporations find it more expensive to issue
    and refinance debt. Valuations are most stretched in the US. As a result, we have
    downgraded our US equity return expectations for euro area investors to an annualised
    2.4%-4.4% over the next 10 years from 3.1%-5.1% heading into 2023\. Within the
    US market, value stocks are more attractive than they have been since late 2021,
    and small-capitalisation stocks also appear attractive for the long term.

- en: US equities have continued to outperform their international peers. The key
    drivers of this performance gap over the last two years have been valuation expansion
    and US dollar strength beyond our fair-value estimates, both of which are likely
    to reverse. Indeed, our Vanguard Capital Markets Model® (VCMM) projections suggest
    an increasing likelihood of greater opportunities outside the US. We project 10-year
    annualised returns of 5.0%-7.0% for non-US developed markets, 4.3%-6.3% for euro-area
    equities and 4.6%-6.6% for emerging markets, all from a euro area investor’s perspective.

    is a welcome development. It provides a solid foundation for long-term risk-adjusted
    returns. However, as the transition to higher rates is not yet complete, near-term
    financial market volatility is likely to remain elevated.

- en: The Vanguard Capital Markets Model^® is a proprietary financial simulation tool
    developed and maintained by Vanguard’s primary investment research and advice
    teams. The model forecasts distributions of future returns for a wide array of
    broad asset classes. Those asset classes include US and international equity markets,
    several maturities of the US Treasury and corporate fixed income markets, international
    fixed income markets, US money markets, commodities and certain alternative investment
    strategies. The theoretical and empirical foundation for the Vanguard Capital
    Markets Model is that the returns of various asset classes reflect the compensation
    investors require for bearing different types of systematic risk (beta). At the
    core of the model are estimates of the dynamic statistical relationship between
    risk factors and asset returns, obtained from statistical analysis based on available
    monthly financial and economic data from as early as 1960\. Using a system of
    estimated equations, the model then applies a Monte Carlo simulation method to
    project the estimated interrelationships among risk factors and asset classes
    as well as uncertainty and randomness over time. The model generates a large set
    of simulated outcomes for each asset class over several time horizons. Forecasts
    are obtained by computing measures of central tendency in these simulations. Results
    produced by the tool will vary with each use and over time.
