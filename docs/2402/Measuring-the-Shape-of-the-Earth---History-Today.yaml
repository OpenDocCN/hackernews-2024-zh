- en: 'In 1726 Voltaire faced a not very difficult choice: imprisonment without trial
    in the Bastille, or exile in England. After sailing across the Channel, he landed
    in another universe. Before leaving France, he declared, he had lived in a world
    that was full – but as soon as he arrived in England, he found one that was empty.
    It even looked different: ‘In Paris you see the Earth shaped like a melon; in
    London it is flattened on two sides.’ According to conventional French science,
    the Earth was stretched out, elongated so that its circumference around the Equator
    was shorter than around the poles. But Isaac Newton disagreed. Under his influence,
    English experts had come to hold the opposite view: that the Earth is squashed
    like a pumpkin, bulging out slightly in the middle.'
