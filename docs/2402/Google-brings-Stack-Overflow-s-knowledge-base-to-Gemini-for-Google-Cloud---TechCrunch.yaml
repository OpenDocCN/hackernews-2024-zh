- en: Developer Q&A site Stack Overflow is launching a new program today that will
    give AI companies access to its knowledge base through a new API, aptly named
    OverflowAPI. The launch partner for this is Google, which will use Stack Overflow’s
    data to enrich Gemini for Google Cloud and provide validated Stack Overflow answers
    in the Google Cloud console. Meanwhile, Stack Overflow will work with Google to
    bring more AI-powered features to its platform, a process it already started last
    year with the [launch of OverflowAI](https://stackoverflow.blog/2023/07/27/announcing-overflowai/).

    [publishing houses](https://techcrunch.com/2023/12/13/openai-inks-deal-with-axel-springer-on-licensing-news-for-model-training/)
    etc.) want to ensure that they get paid when large language models ingest their
    data. While Google and Stack Overflow aren’t discussing the financial terms of
    this partnership, it’s worth noting that this is not an exclusive partnership.

    the problems that we want to solve for users,” Stack Overflow CEO Prashanth Chandrasekar
    told me. “Other companies — it’s been fascinating the number of inbounds that
    we received from companies of all kinds that are experimenting with LLM training,
    with AI products — cloud companies and non-cloud companies that are looking to
    become cloud companies — all sorts of folks who are trying to leverage our data
    in very, very powerful ways. This program, this OverflowAPI program, is absolutely
    available for all partners to work with us on.”

    is also a world where far fewer developers go to the Stack Overflow website to
    ask and answer questions (and copy-and-paste them into their code). “We want to
    be wherever the developer is,” Chandrasekar told me when I asked him about that.
    And while he acknowledges that he believes the developer workflow will change
    due to these AI tools, he still believes that there is a need for a trustworthy
    knowledge base of validated answers. The ultimate vision here, he said, is “for
    humans and AI to come together” and ensure that developers can trust the answers
    from the AI tools because they are derived from the knowledge base created by
    subject matter experts.

    Stack Overflow right into the Google Cloud console and will allow developers to
    see answers and ask questions right from there.

    next to all of the Google-specific responses, you will see Stack Overflow-specific
    responses,” Gabe Monroy, Google’s VP of developer experience for Google Cloud,
    explained. “Those two things will start to merge together from a developer experience
    perspective. Now, that’s really important, because what that means is developers
    get a smooth experience. They don’t have to go hunting and clicking around different
    sites. Everything that they would want, Stack Overflow questions and answers,
    as well as Google Cloud-specific question answers, all in the same spot.”

    AI platform. Currently, the team is evaluating what that will look like, but you
    can imagine AI support in the question-asking and moderation processes, for example,
    as well as in the form of an assistant that can answer questions on the site.

- en: Stack Overflow derives its value from having this vast user base of expert users
    and now more than a decade of questions and answers about virtually any computer
    science problem (and while Stack Overflow also runs a network of similar sites
    about other topics, the focus right now is on its flagship developer-oriented
    site). Chandrasekar noted that it’s very important to ensure that this quality
    remains high and isn’t diluted by low-quality, AI-derived answers itself. In part,
    that’s why Google is integrating the human elements of the Stack Overflow platform.

    best in terms of quality and accuracy,” he said. He argued that the barrier for
    entry for asking questions is going to be much lower for many developers because
    they’ll be interacting with Gemini, not an opinionated group of fellow programmers.
    You’re getting a little bit of the best of both worlds, which is fantastic,” he
    said.

    of this. “As the team at Stack [Overflow] looks to use Gemini to roll out new
    features, making sure that it’s not disrupting what is beautiful and what is pristine
    about the way Stack Overflow has served the developer community […] for many years
    — that’s sacred.”
