- en: The crowd was shocked. People started paying attention and gathered around.
    Nothing happened for another 30 seconds until someone else jumped on the hood.

    Clapping etc.

    others graffitiing the car.

- en: Someone yelled out “burn it” and others cheered in support. Apparently a firework
    was lit underneath the car, and then another one was thrown inside, and that one
    caused the whole thing to catch fire and explode as bystanders hollered and took
    pictures and video. No one stopped it or stood in the way.

  zh: 有人喊出“烧了它”的话语，其他人为此欢呼。显然，一枚烟花被点燃放置在车底下，然后又扔进了另一枚烟花，导致整个车辆着火并爆炸，旁观者大声呼喊并拍摄照片和视频。没有人阻止或站在路上。
- en: Online, the reaction was swift and predictable. The images went viral, naturally
    — they were pretty wild! And then came the perfunctory driverless car supporters,
    deriding the torchers as mindless [hoodlums](https://twitter.com/LouisAnslow/status/1756788760556064839),
    casting them as backwards-looking people who knew not what they did. As [Luddites](https://twitter.com/search?q=waymo%20car%20luddites&src=typed_query).

  zh: 在线上，反应迅速而可预测。这些图片自然而然地迅速走红——它们非常惊人！然后，那些例行公事的无人驾驶车支持者出现了，嘲笑焚烧者为没有头脑的“暴徒”，将他们描绘为一无所知的倒退人群。如同[Luddites](https://twitter.com/search?q=waymo%20car%20luddites&src=typed_query)。
- en: 'The ‘hoodlum’ argument doesn’t really hold up. There are unmanned vehicles
    all across the city, aka unattended parked cars, and I didn’t hear about crowds
    gathering to cheer on the grand, performative demolition of any of those. And elites
    have been painting people who protest or dismantle technologies that make them
    rich as Luddites for nearly 200 years. Then as now, those elites want to use it
    as an insult — to tell us that these are just kneejerk spasms of unthinking protest
    against a technology that is inevitable (and that they likely have some investment
    staked in), all while obscuring the real grievances at play: the question of *why*
    self-driving cars have become such popular targets.'

  zh: “暴徒”论点并不成立。全城到处都是无人驾驶车辆，也就是无人看管的停放汽车，我没听说过有人群聚集起来为任何一个进行盛大、表演性的拆毁欢呼。而精英们一直把那些抗议或拆除使他们富有的技术的人们描绘成鲁达分子已经近200年了。那时如今，这些精英们想要用它作为侮辱——告诉我们，这些只是对技术反应迅速、毫无思考的抗议，而这种技术是不可避免的（并且他们可能对其有所投资），同时掩盖了真正的抱怨：为什么自动驾驶汽车已经成为如此受欢迎的目标。
- en: Might it be because are legitimately angry that Silicon Valley has so often
    ignored or papered over public outcry? Or closed off any meaningful avenues where
    democratic input into how it deploys its products and services might be received?
    Or shirked any serious accountability for its shortcomings and misdeeds?

- en: Over the last decade, from Uber to crypto to web3 to generative AI, Silicon
    Valley has offered not a vision of the future, but a series of increasingly desperate
    and disparate pitches — a patchwork of driverless vehicles for financial gain,
    if you will, that each uniquely fail to consider any prospective social cost.
    The actual self-driving cars are but one very tangible manifestation of a “move
    fast and break things” ethos that now clearly registers as toxic to people who
    have to live among the rubble.

  zh: 过去十年间，从Uber到加密货币，再到Web3和生成式AI，硅谷提供的不是未来的愿景，而是一系列日益绝望和不协调的推销——一个关于无人驾驶车的拼凑品，如果你愿意这么说的话，每一个都独特地忽视了任何可能的社会成本。实际的自动驾驶汽车只是“快速行动、破坏一切”的伦理观念的一个非常具体的表现，现在清楚地显示出对那些不得不生活在废墟中的人们是有毒的。
- en: The original Luddites opposed "machinery hurtful to commonality," not any and
    all new tech. Today's self-driving car adversaries seem to be operating on a similar
    principle. And as the feeling of helplessness grows among those pushed around
    by the tech giants’ whims and schemes, the climate for resistance will only continue
    to ripen. The distance will shrink between the hammer and the loom — between the
    firework and the self-driving car.

  zh: 最初的鲁达分子反对“对公共利益有害的机械”，而不是一切新技术。今天的自动驾驶车反对者似乎也在奉行类似的原则。随着那些被科技巨头的心血来潮和阴谋推动的人们的无助感增加，抵抗的氛围只会继续成熟。锤子与织机之间的距离将会缩小——烟花与自动驾驶汽车之间的距离也将缩短。
