    a length of time, building a vibration profile for a normal, healthy railway.
    When the DAS data suddenly starts showing something different, you might have
    an issue, which shows up like an EKG picking up a problem with a human heartbeat.
    “What we’re doing is profiling the track, looking for changes in the acoustic
    signature,” says Daniel Pyke, a rail expert and spokesperson for Sensonic, which
    develops DAS technology for railroads. “We know what track *should* sound like,
    we know what a train *should* sound like. And we know that if it’s changing—so
    let’s say this joint is coming loose—that needs someone to go and fix it before
    it becomes a problem.”

    either direction from its interrogator. He adds that this sort of system running
    continuously might cut down on the human labor required to inspect railroad tracks
    around the world, a dangerous job given all the massive machines zipping around.
    If someone is digging at the cables for copper to sell, Sensonic can detect that
    too, or even if people are just walking by, trespassing along the tracks.

    near railroad tracks, both to protect the species and a train’s passengers. That’d
    trigger an alarm to alert staff of a potential collision. “We had to actually
    hire an elephant and go wander down the railway,” says Pyke. “It was one of the
    most interesting expenses you’ll ever file.”

- en: The challenge is that DAS produces almost *too* much data. Instead of a single
    sensor sitting at one point along a track, this is stretching vast distances up
    and down the rail. So data is coming in from 40 meters down the fiber optic cable
    and 40 kilometers away, and every little point in between—all day and night. “The
    files you generate are *huge*, so you’re going to have to use machine learning
    to automate it,” says University of Southampton research engineer David Milne,
    who’s [studying](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0888327020301552)
    DAS and railways. “There’s just going to be so much data. If you don’t have a
    computer helping you out, I don’t think it’ll be manageable or economic.”

- en: Sensonic says it has trained AI on real railway data to recognize an event like
    a rockfall among all the noise. Then, an alert sent to railway operators is mere
    kilobytes in size. “The machine learning and AI models used to identify these
    events are continually refined to improve both their sensitivity and to reduce
    false alarms,” says Pyke.

- en: It’s still early days of using DAS for a variety of applications, railroads
    included, so researchers are still honing these systems. “Distributed acoustic
    sensing is one area that suppliers and carriers are exploring to see if it can
    meaningfully advance safety goals,” says Jessica Kahanek, spokesperson for the
    Association of American Railroads. “When railroads test new technologies, they
    are looking to see not just if it works in a lab but also if it can perform when
    exposed to the harsh operational realities of an outdoor network that spans the
    continent.”

    years, as the technology “hears” a growing number of disturbances aboveground.
