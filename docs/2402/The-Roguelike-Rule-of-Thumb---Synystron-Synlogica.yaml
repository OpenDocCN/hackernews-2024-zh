- en: It's self-answering. Self-contained. Thanks to the wonderful powerful of the
    English language! (And, long before most of y'all were born we had "books" called
    "dictionaries" where words had "definitions" and we learned them in "school" and
    "used" them. Correctly. I'd put correctly in quotes but the *meaning* of *correctness*
    has NOT changed since. Shocking!)

    First was that if you are under a certain age you are almost always using the
    term wrong. Second was to walk people through a mental exercise to help them (re-)
    learn both the meaning of the *actual* words involved, and the relevant comparison
    analytics when gauging their applicability. :-)

    or so other computer games all clearly... *like* Rogue!
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We, then, at that time, called them "Rogue-likes."  (I know because I myself
    was "there" at the time. And I myself, at least, needed useful terms for things.
    Back when we went from just having Rogue to then *also* having a bunch of additional
    games which each were *like* it. It was not a hard or esoteric phenomenon for
    us to grok.) Made sense! We all knew *exactly* what we were talking about then.
    And *nothing* has changed with either the word "Rogue" or the word "like" since.

- en: Well, we all know fruits, right? We know a grapefruit is NOT an orange and yet
    it is clearly orange-like? You see how the banana might strain the definition
    but still... it has a credible argument? You understand why calling a monkey "an
    orange-like" is a joke? Why calling a shark an orange-like has crossed well into
    the land of the utterly insane? Don't get me started on whether a Feynman diagram
    is anything at all like an orange. I will slap you if you get in hand's reach.

    arcade games (in bricks-and-mortar "malls") and in home video console (eg. Atari
    2600) cartridge-based games of ALL genres, for a DEACADE plus -- platforms where
    you could NOT save and restore. I also played plenty of procgen games that had
    nothing to do with dungeons or Terminals or ASCII. Empire! SimCity! Civ! I could
    go on and on and on... (Hell I even wrote a private clone of Empire once! (Imperium.)
    I kinda had to know how to do *procgen* for it! But it was otherwise nothing at
    all like Rogue.)'

    solitaire computer version of D&D!!! The dungeon delving aspects of it. Is *your*
    game about descending into a dungeon filled with dragons? Is it played in a Terminal?
    Does it use ASCII glyphs? If none of those things are true about *your* game then
    you probably should STFU with your Rogue-like wannabe hipster nonsense.
