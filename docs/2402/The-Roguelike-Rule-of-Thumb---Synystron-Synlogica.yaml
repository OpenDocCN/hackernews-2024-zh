    English language! (And, long before most of y'all were born we had "books" called
    "dictionaries" where words had "definitions" and we learned them in "school" and
    "used" them. Correctly. I'd put correctly in quotes but the *meaning* of *correctness*
    has NOT changed since. Shocking!)

    First was that if you are under a certain age you are almost always using the
    term wrong. Second was to walk people through a mental exercise to help them (re-)
    learn both the meaning of the *actual* words involved, and the relevant comparison
    analytics when gauging their applicability. :-)

    was "there" at the time. And I myself, at least, needed useful terms for things.
    Back when we went from just having Rogue to then *also* having a bunch of additional
    games which each were *like* it. It was not a hard or esoteric phenomenon for
    us to grok.) Made sense! We all knew *exactly* what we were talking about then.
    And *nothing* has changed with either the word "Rogue" or the word "like" since.

    it is clearly orange-like? You see how the banana might strain the definition
    but still... it has a credible argument? You understand why calling a monkey "an
    orange-like" is a joke? Why calling a shark an orange-like has crossed well into
    the land of the utterly insane? Don't get me started on whether a Feynman diagram
    is anything at all like an orange. I will slap you if you get in hand's reach.

    2600) cartridge-based games of ALL genres, for a DEACADE plus -- platforms where

    nothing to do with dungeons or Terminals or ASCII. Empire! SimCity! Civ! I could

    solitaire computer version of D&D!!! The dungeon delving aspects of it. Is *your*
    game about descending into a dungeon filled with dragons? Is it played in a Terminal?
    Does it use ASCII glyphs? If none of those things are true about *your* game then
    you probably should STFU with your Rogue-like wannabe hipster nonsense.
