- en: Back in her spiritual home after spending the last six months of 1953 in Manus,
    she felt refreshed, confident. She was already thinking through her book about
    her experience; *New Lives for Old *would be the title, and it would describe
    the Noise, an apocalyptic religious movement which spread through the island of
    Manus, which lies northeast of New Guinea, in the aftermath of World War II. In
    1947, a prophet had emerged on Manus who predicted a coming age of abundance,
    even immortality. But first, the old ways had to be cast out. Reports poured in
    of visionary experiences, trance states, even seizures. Hats of colonial officials
    were ritually burned, and a coming age of abundance was proclaimed. Mead found
    the Noise fascinating because she saw it as a prelude to other new cultural forms
    which she believed would appear elsewhere as a response to the rapid changes of
    the 20^(th) century—including in the United States. She saw the movement in relatively
    benign terms. True, it really *was *an apocalyptic cult, she wrote, complete with
    mystical “prophetic dreams” and the promise of “a utopia to be immediately established
    on earth.” But who said utopian dreams were entirely bad?

    All human societies, everywhere, needed to learn to change in similar ways and
    with similar speed, avoiding the excesses of what she called “the apocalyptic
    cult aspect” but also recognizing that, as she later put it, “conscious intervention
    in the process of cultural evolution and human survival” was now the most urgent
    task that humanity faced. This was the goal of her science. And the things she
    saw and heard in the spring and summer of 1954 made her think that psychedelics
    might be part of it.

    was Dr. Harold Abramson, an allergist and expert in “psychosomatic” illnesses.
    Among other things, Abramson had shared with her the results of an LSD trial that
    resulted in what he called “loss of fear of homosexuality”: a woman racked by
    anxiety over her suspicion that she might be a lesbian had, under the drug, resolved
    her fears. Mead, who was in a committed, yearslong relationship with fellow anthropologist
    [Rhoda Métraux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhoda_M%C3%A9traux) by this time,
    absorbed this information with great interest. Perhaps LSD could speed up the
    rate at which global culture adapted to rapid change. Perhaps, as she wrote to
    herself in June 1954, the drug could be a “short cut” for pulling society “away
    from mysticism and escape.”'

    mid-1950s, history would have changed. A case could be made that with Einstein’s
    death in 1955, Mead became the world’s best-known living scientist.In that year
    ([by one measure](https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=Margaret+Mead%2CJonas+Salk%2CAlbert+Einstein%2CJ.+Robert+Oppenheimer%2CNiels+Bohr%2CLinus+Pauling%2CEnrico+Fermi&year_start=1930&year_end=1970&corpus=en-2019&smoothing=0))
    her name appeared in print more frequently than that of any other scientist alive
    at the time. Among dead ones, remarkably, she was within shooting distance of
    Charles Darwin and Isaac Newton. Even science-fiction novels were not free of
    her. In Robert Heinlein’s *Citizen of the Galaxy *(1957), the book’s orphaned
    protagonist is mentored by a space anthropologist named “Doctor Margaret Mader”
    who teaches him how to navigate the cultural shifts he faces as he skips from
    ship to ship, planet to planet.

    needed to expand its “awareness,” its collective consciousness, in order to survive—with
    an implicit optimism. A young Carl Sagan was among Mead’s avid readers. As a student
    at the University of Chicago, he became fascinated with the ways her work “gave
    you a view of the arbitrariness of cultural mores, cultural systems.” Sagan was
    drawn to the “tremendous optimism” of “the idea that you weren’t jostled about
    by the winds of the world. That you could do something” to change the future.
    When an 18-year-old Sagan wrote his first piece of popular science writing, a
    radio script called “Ad Astra,” he dreamed of scoring an interview with Mead.

    to her full-time job. On Wednesday, June 16, she had lunch with her friend Gotthard
    Booth and mentioned the new project. Booth reminded her, she wrote, of “my earlier
    refusal to take Mescal[ine], said I’d said it while we were going somewhere in
    a taxi, must have been early 40’s,” after which he explained “he HAD taken mescal[ine]
    in experiments in Germany, and thought he owed much of his insight to it.” With

    the Boston trial had been transformative. He became fascinated by the anthropology
    of the abnormal—from trance states to traditional magical practices to the possibility
    of ESP. Mead mentored him, and in return he became what anthropologists call an
    “informant.” Mead had many contacts among psychedelic researchers at this time,

    Harvard psilocybin experiments of the early 1960s) became her most important contact

    at the end of *New Lives for Old*, which she wrote during the period of her involvement
    in Abramson’s psychedelic research, lead to the acceptance of “new patterns.”
    The Noise, Mead wrote, was just one part of a continuum of “conversion experiences”:
    others included the altered consciousness of the Balinese trance dancer, the alcoholic’s
    moment of clarity, and the experience “evoked by drugs.” All involved “the complete
    destruction of the past.” These moments of rupture would be the defining experiences
    of the 20^(th) and 21^(st) centuries. We could not survive if we rejected them.'

    speaking from experience. She knew enough by then to see that any drug capable
    of transforming one’s sense of self could also be repurposed as a technology of
    control. Mead believed in psychedelics’ ability, as she put it in a letter to
    Blum on Sept. 24, 1954, to be “integrative and insight giving”—but only if pursued

    Mead was pregnant in New York City. Throughout June and July, letters flew back

    wrote. “Since Ruth Benedict died [in 1948] there is no one alive who had read
    everything that I have written … Since the break up of my marriage, far less of
    my life has been shared with one person … It has not been by my choice of concealment
    that anyone of you have been left in ignorance of some part of my life which would
    seem, I know, of great importance.” Instead, this concealment had been “only from
    the exigencies of the mid-twentieth century when each one of us—at least those
    of us who are my age—seems fated for a life which is no longer sharable.” Her
    daughter, Mary Catherine, wrote that her mother kept a great many secrets, and

    behavior, a precondition to her availability to do the work that she felt was
