    Framework has a super novel approach to repairability and upgrades. You can easily

    has subsided, and even if there’s still an advantage on the laptop side, it’s
    much less than it has been. That surprised me. But it’s surprised me even more
    how well Microsoft has managed to integrate Linux with Windows. I thought for

    WSL integration where all the files actually live inside the Linux subsystem,

    from my last go-around with Windows.

    the Ubuntu terminal to open any directory in VSCode on the Windows side. Now that’s

    the other way around. Switching to OSX in 2001 felt like the rebel move. Now daring
