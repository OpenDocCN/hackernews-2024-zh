    distribution natively, so you can use the same package manager that you’ll deploy
    against. Oh, and since it’s x86, you’ll be building Docker images for your server
    hardware in a fraction of the time it takes to multi-arch on arm64.

    lags behind the M-series by a bit. It’ll run the Speedometer 2.1 in 300-350 and
    our HEY test suite in about 3m31s . My M2 Pro laptop can hit over 500(!) on the
    Speedometer, and complete the test suite in 2m16s (although it quickly throttles
    on repeated runs to ~3 minutes).'

    possible outside the M-chip universe. That CPU clocked the fastest ever run I’ve

    Framework has a super novel approach to repairability and upgrades. You can easily
    swap out any component by yourself, often without tools. Anyone who went through
    multiple rounds of keyboard replacements with their MacBooks in the horror days
    of the butterfly keyboard can appreciate how helpful that might be.

    has subsided, and even if there’s still an advantage on the laptop side, it’s
    much less than it has been. That surprised me. But it’s surprised me even more
    how well Microsoft has managed to integrate Linux with Windows. I thought for
    sure there’d be a performance penalty to running under WSL. Or that it would be
    clunky and kludgy. But it just wasn’t.
  prefs: []

- en: VSCode is part of the trick here. It ships out of the box with an excellent
    WSL integration where all the files actually live inside the Linux subsystem,
    so there’s none of that old cross-the-filesystem-chasm slowdown that I remember
    from my last go-around with Windows.

    your username/password, and you’ll have Ubuntu 22.04 running. Then install VSCode,
    which auto-detects that WSL is installed, and voila, you can type “code .” in
    the Ubuntu terminal to open any directory in VSCode on the Windows side. Now that’s
    slick!

    both are pretty idiosyncratic reasons, which almost certainly won’t apply to the

    1990s for everyone I knew in tech, and Apple was the underdog darling. Now it’s
    the other way around. Switching to OSX in 2001 felt like the rebel move. Now daring
    to run Windows in 2024 would make you the odd one out in a lot of communities.
