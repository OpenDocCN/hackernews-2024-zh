    on the fifth try. Even worse, they look obvious in hindsight, making it easy for

- en: After years of trying, a fintech losing millions from fraud concludes that machine
    learning cannot solve the problem. But one team persists in launching experiments,
    the model is improved, and a user researcher realizes that fraudsters are guiding
    customers through the in-app warning screen. With this combination of insights,
    the latest iteration reduces fraud by 90%, the top win for the tech team that
    year. The aha moment is that it took the right combination of iterations on the
    machine learning model combined with a radically different design of the app screens.

- en: In the book "The Moment of Clarity," the authors question traditional business
    problem-solving, made popular by the likes of McKinsey & Co. Their research shows
    that a nonlinear approach drawing from anthropology, sociology, philosophy, and

- en: Intuition is underrated. If you have something you care about, whether artisan
    coffee places, brutalist architecture, or art from Germany’s cold gaze of the
    1920s, you have an intuition for it. You can pick up on things you can’t quite
    express. This intuition is often lost at work, with many layers between your work
    and the customer. A market report summary is no substitute for using your own
    product. Spend time where your customers are and make your own conclusions.

- en: Focus on the big problem first. Before jumping head-first into a new problem,
    find a piece of A3 paper and map out the bigger picture to see where you fit in.
    If a company loses $10 million on fraud but only $100,000 on faulty chargebacks,
    it’s 100x more impactful to figure out how to solve the former. It’s obvious in
    hindsight, but too often, too much time is spent without the bigger picture in
    mind.

- en: Think in terms of one-way and two-way door decisions. In his annual shareholder
    newsletter, Jeff Bezos talks about decisions as either one-way or two-way door
    decisions. Two-way door decisions can easily be reversed. One-way door decisions

    slow everyone around you down. Don’t do this to others. Instead, be brief and

    But know that this process takes time. Jason Fried and David Heinemeier Hansson
    from Basecamp are masters at this. Their book, Rework, just passed one million
    copies sold. Just before publishing the book, they reduced it from 50,000 to 25,000
    words, less than half that of a normal business book, to the great displeasing
