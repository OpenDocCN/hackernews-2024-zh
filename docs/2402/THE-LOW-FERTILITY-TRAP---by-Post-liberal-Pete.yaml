    state my thesis baldly at the beginning: there is a large overlap between the
    things that underpin long-standing worldwide birth-rate declines and the things
    that underpin our prosperity. As the biologist [John Aitken](https://x.com/post_liberal/status/1592969315032002560?s=46)
    has put it:- ‘The fundamental cause of human fertility decline is prosperity.’
    Therefore, birth-rate declines are hard to undo and reverse because to unpick
    low-fertility risks also unpicking our prosperity too. Therefore, pronatalists
    face an uphill battle, to put it mildly. [Pronatalism](https://thecritic.co.uk/political-fever-dreams/)
    (a term used to describe advocates for policies geared towards increasing fertility
    rates) is [nothing new](https://academic.oup.com/book/9729?login=false) but has
    gained greater salience in recent years due to rapidly rising [old age dependency
    ratios](https://x.com/post_liberal/status/1701281985962869161?s=46) across the
    OECD countries in particular. [The Economist](https://x.com/post_liberal/status/1575283606364340225?s=46)
    reports that the share of countries with pro-natalist policies has grown from
    20% in 2005 to 28% in 2019\. In any analysis of the merits or demerits of pronatalism
    it is important to differentiate between liberal and illiberal forms of pronatalism.
    In its illiberal guise, pronatalism can be motivated by an ugly ethno-nationalist
    undercurrent which views pronatalism as a means of avoiding what it perceives
    to be the evils of mass-immigration, which is seen in catastrophic terms as tantamount
    to ethnic replacement and racial/civilisational suicide. But this form of pronatalism
    is, at best, a fringe view in this country and I''m not going to waste my time
    critiquing a set of views which are not held by anyone with any real influence
    or power.'

    which holds sway over a greater swathe of policy-makers. There are [bad-faith
    critics](https://x.com/post_liberal/status/1579053777021440000?s=46) who will
    try to collapse the two forms of pronatalism into one and pretend that all forms
    of pronatalism are inherently morally suspect, but this is not a view I subscribe
    to. My critique of liberal pronatalism is not that it is inherently morally problematic
    to utilise various policies to try to encourage more people to have children. 
    Pronatalism, in its liberal form, is a perfectly legitimate set of policy aims.
    My argument is pragmatic, not moralistic. My argument is that liberal pronatalism
    is simply not going to work. As the authors of [Empty Planet’](https://amzn.eu/c2g6hA1)
    explain:- ‘the “low-fertility trap” ensures that, once having one or two children
    becomes the norm, it stays the norm. Couples no longer see having children as
    a duty they must perform to satisfy their obligation to their families or their
    god. Rather, they choose to raise a child as an act of personal fulfilment. And
    they are quickly fulfilled.’

    of dichotomising economic versus cultural factors, a tendency which tends to obscure,
    rather than illuminate, analysis of fertility trends. For instance, [urbanisation](https://x.com/post_liberal/status/1518223866430164993?s=46)
    is associated with birth-rate declines (current estimates indicate that [70%](https://x.com/post_liberal/status/1742148515722104949?s=46)
    of the world’s population will be living in urban locales by 2070 and it's already
    at [83%](https://x.com/post_liberal/status/1394918007307227138?s=46) in the UK)
    but is urbanisation a cultural factor or an economic factor? a bit of both is
    the answer. Economics ***or*** culture is therefore a false dichotomy. In predominantly
    rural societies, children are an extra pair of hands and an insurance policy against
    old age and sickness when there are no social safety nets, so, in that sense,
    an economic factor. I once worked with a West African lady (who had been born
    and raised in a rural location) who described her five children as literally her
    “pension.” This is a vivid illustration of the ways in which children are viewed
    as economic assets in predominantly rural societies and stands in stark contrast
    to urbanised societies, such as the UK, where children are widely viewed primarily
    in terms of being an economic cost, rather than an extra pair of hands  and an
    insurance against old age and sickness. In industrial and postindustrial societies,
    complete with extensive social safety nets, and with work located away from home
    in a factory or in an office, as opposed to at home on a smallholding or a farm,
    the economic equation of having children is fundamentally altered.

    norm within a culture then this has a tendency to become mutually reinforcing.
    Having a small family, or no children at all, when everyone else around you are
    having large families, automatically makes you the odd one out. Humans are social
    creatures with an instinct to conform and this creates a degree of path-dependency
    with respect to fertility-levels, which can make them difficult to change without
    a fundamental alteration in material circumstances. Additionally, people in rural
    societies are more likely to live near an extended family-network. Whereas in
    urban societies, with its greater degree of geographical mobility, population
    churn and [social dislocation](https://x.com/david_goodhart/status/1465379979202551810?s=46),
    proximal family networks tend to be replaced with co-workers and university friends
    and the like. As the authors of [‘Empty Planet](https://amzn.eu/2SP8GXG)’ explain,
    this has ramifications for fertility because ‘family members encourage each other
    to have children, whereas non-kin don’t.’

    rates in predominantly rural societies, given that in rural areas people are more
    likely, on average, to live near [extended famil](https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2022/05/18/more-than-half-of-americans-live-within-an-hour-of-extended-family/#:~:text=Roughly%20six-in-ten%20adults,and%2050%%20in%20urban%20areas.)y

    of parental support with adult daughters' entry into parenthood](https://x.com/leapessin/status/1410266337834831880?s=46).
    Birth control, as a technological factor, is another good example of the false
    dichotomy between economics versus culture as regards analysing fertility trends.
    Birth control measures, such as condoms or the pill, are a material issue, but
    their take-up is influenced by cultural factors. We can see this quite clearly
    with respect to the British total fertility rate which fell in [1877](https://t.co/ozMIaBK8dz)
    due to a change to social norms when a book about birth control triggered a controversial
    censorship trial. Birth control is a material factor, but the take up of various
    forms of birth control are influenced by changes in social norms, which are [cultural](https://x.com/lymanstoneky/status/1117815316212359169?s=46).
    Needless to say, economics *versus* culture, as opposed to economics *via* culture,
    is the wrong frame for an analysis of fertility trends.

    puts steady upward pressure on public spending and would see public debt more
    than double to over 250 per cent of GDP by 2070 if no further fiscal action is

    into gerontocracies with rapidly increasing levels of intergenerational inequality.

    as the [demographic transition](https://ourworldindata.org/demographic-transition).
    The demographic transition started in North-West Europe around [1800](https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/089533003772034943)
    — the total fertility rate in [France](https://x.com/post_liberal/status/1753172770051989672?s=46),
    for instance, dropped by 20% between 1800 and 1870 alone —and has been slowly
    spreading outwards to the rest of the world since then. This demographic transition
    has been revolutionary in its implications. As demographer [Ronald Lee](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/089533003772034943)
    explains:- ‘before the start of the demographic transition, life was short, births
    were many, growth was slow and the population was young. During the transition,
    first mortality and then fertility declined, causing population growth rates first
    to accelerate and then to slow again, moving toward low fertility, long life and
    an old population. The transition began around 1800 with declining mortality in
    Europe. It has now spread to all parts of the world and is projected to be completed
    by 2100\. This global demographic transition has brought momentous changes, reshaping
    the economic and demographic life cycles of individuals and restructuring populations.
    Since 1800, global population size has already increased by a factor of six and
    by 2100 will have risen by a factor of ten. There will then be 50 times as many
    elderly, but only five times as many children; thus, the ratio of elders to children
    will have risen by a factor of ten. The length of life, which has already more
    than doubled, will have tripled, while births per woman will have dropped from
    six to two. In 1800, women spent about 70 percent of their adult years bearing
    and rearing young children, but that fraction has decreased in many parts of the
    world to only about 14 percent, due to lower fertility and longer life.’

    defining events in human history—will occur in three decades, give or take, when
    the global population starts to decline. Once that decline begins, it will never
    end. We do not face the challenge of a population bomb but of a population bust,
    a relentless, generation after generation culling of the human herd. Nothing like
    this has ever happened before…..Population decline isn’t a good thing or a bad
    thing. But it is a big thing. A child born today will reach middle age in a world
    in which conditions and expectations are very different from our own. She will
    find the planet more urban, with less crime, environmentally healthier but with
    many more old people. She won’t have trouble finding a job, but she may struggle
    to make ends meet, as taxes to pay for health care and pensions for all those
    seniors eat into her salary. There won’t be as many schools, because there won’t

    types are naturally inclined to emphasise aspects of the problem which might be

    which are less amenable to change via policy, factors that tend to be mostly cultural.
    We rely on policy-wonks for their specific knowledge about particular subjects
    but they tend to have their own biases. One of which tends to be the belief that
    something can be done in regards to the particular problems that form the locus

    something can be done with respect to their area of expertise because otherwise:
    what are they doing exactly? However, sometimes very little can realistically
    be done with respect to certain intractable problems. In the case of birth-rate
    declines, if the same factors that play a role in fostering birth-rate declines
    also play a role in fostering our prosperity then reversing those birth-rate declines

    are often adduced as a primary factor behind declining birth rates in this country.

    a real problem, but they are not the primary reason why the UK has a below replacement-rate

    example of Tokyo indicates that building more houses will not, in of itself, do

    [Financial Times](https://x.com/post_liberal/status/1441135575801614337?s=46)
    estimates that an average dual-earner, two-child family in England, spends about
    40% of its disposable income on childcare (as compared to 5% in Germany.) Our
    childcare system is estimated to be the [third most expensive childcare system](https://x.com/post_liberal/status/1441337634178027524?s=46)
    in the world (behind only Slovakia and Switzerland.) There is no question that
    this is a serious problem that requires serious solutions but childcare costs
    are not the primary reason why the UK has a below replacement-rate fertility-level.
    Our low birth-rate predates our [current childcare issues](https://x.com/post_liberal/status/1742801274385387688?s=46)
    and in countries which have universal free childcare, such as Nordic nations like
    [Finland](https://x.com/keithnhumphreys/status/1633105271722475522?s=46), we do
    not see an appreciable increase in the birth-rate. In [Norway](https://x.com/post_liberal/status/1678803247128100864?s=46),
    for example, the average family only spends 8% on childcare and parents also share
    49 weeks of parental leave at full pay, but yet their total fertility rate is
    also below replacement-rate levels and, as recently as 2020, was lower than the
    UK rate at [1.48 births per woman](https://datacommons.org/place/country/NOR?utm_medium=explore&mprop=fertilityRate&popt=Person&cpv=gender,Female&hl=en)
    compared to [1.56 births per woman](https://datacommons.org/place/country/GBR?utm_medium=explore&mprop=fertilityRate&popt=Person&cpv=gender,Female&hl=en)
    in the UK.

    for our modern levels of prosperity, via [agglomeration](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economies_of_agglomeration)
    effects, but changes the economic equation of having children from one of an economic
    investment to one of an economic liability. Gradually this leads to less people
    having children and (combined with increased life-expectancy) results in an ageing
    society with a reliance on immigration to make up for the shortfall in the workforce.

    policies added together’ —are not things that we are likely to reverse, or, in
    some cases, even, things that we actually want to reverse anyway. So this presents
    us with an existential societal dilemma. Economic stagnation via low fertility
    and low immigration, like we see in Japan, or endless right wing populist nativist
    backlashes via low fertility and high-immigration, like we see in Western Europe
    and North America. Given that these are the other options, it is unsurprising
    that liberal pro-natalists cling to the comfort blanket that we can easily shift
    the dial on fertility by tinkering with policies related to tax, housing, childcare
    and the like.

    mean that they are willing to make the lifestyle changes that would be necessary
    to achieve this in an obesogenic environment geared towards sedentary living and
    with the ubiquitous availability of highly-caloric food. Likewise, in the abstract,
    people will often say that they want to have more children than they currently

    and Prosper](https://amzn.eu/6a1c4Rl),’ we get a glimpse into what a high-fertility
    culture actually looks like:- ‘compared with the rest of the world, sub-Saharan
    Africa has relatively high levels of illiteracy (34% in 2018) and low education.
    There are fewer economic opportunities and often restricted access to contraception.
    People in this world region are generally more religious, tend to have more traditional
    family values and fatalistic attitudes toward childbearing are widespread. Childbearing
    and marriage remain close to universal, and majorities marry at a relatively young
    age. Within marriages, childbearing is often expected and is the basis for legal,
    social, and cultural systems.’ A high-fertility culture would be one which was
    less [urban](https://x.com/post_liberal/status/1639703339620343810?s=46), more
    [religious](https://x.com/kbguzzo/status/1317146986903072770?s=46), probably with
    less [birth control](https://x.com/post_liberal/status/1542973725351477251?s=46),
    certainly with [more teenage births,](https://x.com/post_liberal/status/1753109139776221224?s=46)
    near universal and early marriages, more [unplanned pregnancies](https://x.com/swinshi/status/1410339739996143617?s=46),
    and one in which women started having children much earlier, likely foregoing
    manifold educational and professional opportunities in the process. In a truly
    high-fertility culture, there would also likely be less emphasis on the importance
    of work and education in general too. Some people would welcome a retraditionalised
    society that was less urban, more [religious](https://x.com/degenrolf/status/1055059408881938432?s=46),
    and one in which more women had lower levels of education and fewer career opportunities
    because they were having children much earlier, but many people would most certainly
    not welcome this set of changes.

    a misleading narrative instead that we can have everything that we want without
    having to make any significant trade-offs. Many of the things that liberal pronatalists
    advocate, such as making home-ownership more widely available, are well worth
    doing, but they are unlikely, in of themselves, to increase the birth-rate by
    much, if at all, and certainly not in any sustained fashion. The low-fertility
    trap that we have found ourselves in goes much deeper than just housing, childcare
    and tax systems and is rooted in a demographic transition that has come to all
    societies which have industrialised, urbanised, secularised and increased their
    educational levels. Urbanisation has given us prosperity but also changes the
    economic equation of having children from an economic investment to an economic
    liability. [Urbanisation](https://x.com/post_liberal/status/1700937644652261475?s=46)

    least we should be honest with ourselves that this problem is not something that
    we can solve simply by tinkering around the edges with housing, childcare and
    tax policies. As Norwegian population economist and social scientist [Vegard Skirbekk](https://amzn.eu/8WhR6Fu)
    has written:- ‘fertility generally tends to be higher in areas where the population
    is less educated, where more people are illiterate, and where there is more poverty
    and fewer economic opportunities.’ If these are the factors associated with high-fertility
    then most people would happily choose low-fertility. The reality is that the factors
    which underpin low-birth rate trends are also the factors which are inextricably
    linked with the prosperity of the countries with low birth-rates and therefore
    we can't easily unpick one without also risking the unravelling of the other.
    As [Vegard Skirbekk](https://amzn.eu/cCpI2lX) has written, ‘fertility tends to
    be higher in regions where the population is less educated, more religious, poorer,
    and more rural.’ This pattern of living is not one which people in the UK are
    likely to find an attractive option.

    reported in 2022 that ‘in 1971, just 18% of 30-year-olds {in England and Wales}

    age-related decline in fecundity has become an important driver of modern-day
    childlessness in industrialised countries.’ This is despite the fact that after
    the age of 30, women are significantly more likely to [miscarry](https://x.com/post_liberal/status/1580148462737592326?s=46),
    to give birth to children with [congenital diseases](https://x.com/post_liberal/status/1754265768638722306?s=46)

    is the oldest age a woman should start childbearing for a 90% chance of having
    2 children. To reverse the pattern of later childbearing would likely take more
    than just policy-tinkering with housing, childcare and tax systems however. Reversing
    the pattern of later childbearing would also likely require some form of retraditionalising

    stagnation](https://x.com/post_liberal/status/1637370773521219585?s=46), but falling
    birth-rates have deep personal consequences on an individual level too. Falling
    birth-rates means fewer brothers, sisters and cousins for our children to socialise
    with and a lonelier world for them in general as they grow older. Rising rates
    of [childlessness](https://x.com/post_liberal/status/1753524610451042688?s=46)
    are also a worrying trend given that participation in marriage and family life
    is associated with [lower suicide-rates](https://x.com/post_liberal/status/1631983747661791232?s=46)
    and a [longer lifespan](https://x.com/post_liberal/status/1532654425390686208?s=46).

    But we will never be able to address the constellation of issues entangled with
    low-fertility without a clear-eyed assessment of how we got to this point, and
    that is something which liberal pronatalism appears to be unwilling or unable
    to provide. We should also be aware that falling birth-rates have some advantages
    too. An ageing society is one that is less likely to have violent crime, for instance,
    given that [young men](https://x.com/post_liberal/status/1706755516091773259?s=46)
    everywhere are responsible for the majority of violent crime. In any case, the
    low fertility trap is part of a demographic transition that happens to every society
    which industrialises and urbanises, it's not something that we can eradicate via
    policy-tinkering nor is it completely negative in every single respect. There
    are no easy answers to the problems that the low fertility trap poses and we would
    do well to be sceptical of anyone who proposes otherwise.
