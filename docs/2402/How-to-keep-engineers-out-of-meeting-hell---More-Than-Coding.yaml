- en: As an engineering manager, you will need meetings to get some things done. Here
    are some quick tips on how to make them more engaging for the engineers who you’ll
    be inviting along.

  id: totrans-split-13
  prefs: []

- en: It’s as simple as that. Suggest that your team ask this question of every meeting
    they attend.
  id: totrans-split-14
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This question instantly reveals if the meeting will be an open-ended, meandering
    discussion that will consume every minute of what’s booked on the calendar (aka,
    the quickest way to send engineers to meeting hell), or if it will be a productive
    use of people’s time.
  id: totrans-split-15

  id: totrans-split-17
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A meeting outcome is not the same as an agenda. An agenda is an outline for
    how the meeting will be conducted, not what it will achieve. A great many pointless
    meetings have had wonderful well-structured agendas.
  id: totrans-split-18
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Meetings need a reason for existence, and that’s why they need a desired outcome.
    Make sure the outcome is clear, achievable, and relevant.
  id: totrans-split-19
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'To test if you have defined a useful outcome, ask yourself this question: **“How
    will the participants behave differently once the meeting is over?”** If you can’t
    think of anything, you don’t have a good outcome defined.'
  id: totrans-split-20
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: An inevitable effect of following the above is that you’ll rarely end up using
    the word “**discuss**” in your meeting name, and that will be a very good thing
    for your engineers.

  id: totrans-split-22

    Don’t force engineers into your management world, instead meet them where they’re
    at.

- en: Most managers schedule calendar time for synchronous work sessions, but there
    are other meeting types that are powerful and less interruptive for engineers.
    My favorite is the **decision meeting**.
  id: totrans-split-24
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'A decision meeting is a forcing function: when your team starts to investigate
    something in order to come to a conclusion on it, you also schedule a meeting
    for a future date to review their decision. This is great for investigations like
    spikes, tool evaluations, or user research.'
  id: totrans-split-25
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This type of meeting is especially useful for indecisive engineers prone to
    *“it-depends-itis”*. In a decision meeting, the agenda should state clearly that
    it will last only 5 or 10 minutes, and the engineers should bring their decision
    in hand.
  id: totrans-split-26
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If it devolves into a discussion meeting, it is up to the manager to either
    make the decision for them, or (as a last resort) reschedule it until they are
    ready to bring a decision to the table.

  id: totrans-split-28
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Limit interruptions with an intentional “when”. Engineers are [makers](https://paulgraham.com/makersschedule.html),
    and need contiguous periods of focus and concentration. Run your meeting at a
    time when the team agrees it will be less interruptive, perhaps at the start of
    the day before they build momentum on a technical task.

    it, and the meeting still be a success, then that person probably wasn’t needed.
    Send them a summary of the outcome later. Heck, there are AI bots that will write
    the summary for you.

- en: 'As a fully synchronous communication method, meetings are expensive in many
    ways. There are many asynchronous alternatives which you should consider too:
    record a video or audio clip with the information you want to convey, run a poll
    on Slack, write up a page on your internal doc system, and so on.'
  id: totrans-split-39
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A meeting appearing on a calendar is an implicit statement that attending it
    is more valuable than letting engineers remain focused on their code, a higher
    priority than other things that could be worked on at that time, and deserving
    of all the interruptions and context switches that it causes.
