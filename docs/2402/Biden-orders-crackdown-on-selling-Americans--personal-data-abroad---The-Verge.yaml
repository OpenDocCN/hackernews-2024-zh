    authorizing the US attorney general “to prevent the large-scale transfer of Americans’
    personal data to countries of concern.” [According to the US Department of Justice](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-implement-groundbreaking-executive-order-addressing-national-security)
    today, those countries could include China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea.

    personal data than ever before — data that includes things like personal health
    and financial data. The scale can be staggering: in a recent extreme example from
    a Consumer Reports study, 48,000 companies had sent Facebook data [on a single
    user](/2024/1/17/24041897/facebook-meta-targeted-advertising-data-mining-study-privacy).'

    The White House writes that the Department of Justice (DOJ) will have to create
    rules to prevent countries of concern from exploiting personal data, though it’s
    not clear through what means the DOJ would accomplish this. The data would include
    that related to genomics, biometrics, personal health, finances, and “certain
    kinds of personal identifiers.” The DOJ would also be required to work with the
    Department of Homeland Security to set new security standards regarding data gathered
    through “investment, vendor, and employment relationships.”

    Veterans Affairs to ensure that Americans’ health data can’t be transferred via
    other routes like federal grants.

    States Telecommunications Services Sector would have to consider personal data
    threats when reviewing submarine cable licenses. The order, which would be the
    president’s third so far this year, has not yet been published to the [Federal
    Register](https://www.federalregister.gov/presidential-documents/executive-orders/joe-biden/2024).

    the overall issue of the personal data market in the US, which has very little
    in the way of boundaries. That leaves us with case-by-case regulatory action by
    agencies like the FTC, which recently banned [two](/2024/1/10/24032966/ftc-bans-outlogic-location-data-sales-tracking-settlement)
    [brokers](/2024/1/18/24043260/the-ftc-bans-another-data-broker-from-selling-your-location-data)
    from selling precise location data that could endanger consumers.

    beating the drum for digital privacy for many years, cited one of those bans when
    he [called on the NSA](https://www.wyden.senate.gov/news/press-releases/wyden-releases-documents-confirming-the-nsa-buys-americans-internet-browsing-records-calls-on-intelligence-community-to-stop-buying-us-data-obtained-unlawfully-from-data-brokers-violating-recent-ftc-order)
    to stop buying location information from data brokers. The [US director of national
    intelligence said](/2023/6/14/23759585/odni-spy-report-surveillance-data-location-tracking)
    information US intelligence agencies buy from them is as detailed as any it could
    have gotten “only through targeted (and predicated) collection.”
