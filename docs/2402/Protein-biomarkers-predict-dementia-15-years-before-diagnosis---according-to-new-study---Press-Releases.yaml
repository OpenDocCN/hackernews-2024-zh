    predict dementia 15 years before diagnosis.

- en: The research, published today in Nature Aging, shows how profiles of proteins
    in the blood accurately predict dementia up to 15 years prior to clinical diagnosis.
    These are known as biomarkers, which are molecules found in blood, other body
    fluids, or tissues that is a sign of a normal or abnormal process, or of a condition
    or disease.

    Shanghai used the largest cohort of blood proteomics and dementia to date, including
    blood samples from 52,645 healthy participants recruited from UK Biobank – a population-based
    study cohort.

    10-15 years later by the research team who analysed them between April 2021 and
    February 2022\. Until March 2023, a total of 1,417 participants went on to develop
    dementia – and these people’s blood showed dysregulation of protein biomarkers.

- en: Of 1,463 proteins analysed, aided by with a type of artificial intelligence
    known as machine learning, 11 proteins were identified and combined as a protein
    panel, which the researchers have shown to be highly accurate at predicting future
    dementia. Further incorporation of conventional risk factors of age, sex, education
    level and genetics, showed for the first time the high accuracy of the predictive
    model, measured at over 90%*, indicating its potential future use in community-based
    dementia screening programs.

- en: Proteins (for example Glial Fibrillary acidic protein, GFAP) had previously
    been identified as potential biomarkers for dementia in smaller studies, but this
    new research was much larger and conducted over several years. Known as a longitudinal
    analysis (a study conducted on a sample of participants over a number of years),
    the researchers were able to show the differences and trajectories between those
    with dementia and controls across 15 years.

- en: An early diagnosis is critical for those with dementia. New drug technology
    can slow, or even reverse the progress of Alzheimer’s, but only if the disease
    is detected early enough. The drug lecanemab is one of two new treatments for
    the disease.

- en: Professor Feng emphasised that the combination of artificial intelligence and
    protein analysis offers a promising avenue for precision medicine. This is highly
    important for screening mid-aged to older individuals within the community who
    are at high risk of dementia. “This model could be seamlessly integrated into
    the NHS and used as a screening tool by GPs”, said Professor Feng.

- en: Professor Wei Cheng, a co-corresponding author from Fudan University, explained
    that this research builds on the team’s previously developed dementia prediction
    model which used variables, such as age, presence of a certain gene and mother’s
    age at death. “Compared to our previous work, the newly developed protein-based
    model is obviously a breakthrough”, he said.

    specialist from Fudan University, added: “The proteomic biomarkers are more easily
    to access and non-invasive, and they can substantially facilitate the application

    on intricate and difficult-to-obtain biomarkers using procedures such as lumbar
    puncture or complex imaging methods meaning their widespread use is hindered because
    of the invasive procedures and the high cost of carrying them out.
