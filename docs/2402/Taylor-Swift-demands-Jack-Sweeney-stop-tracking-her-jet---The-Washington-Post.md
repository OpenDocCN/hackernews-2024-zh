# Taylor Swift demands Jack Sweeney stop tracking her jet - The Washington Post

> 来源：[https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/02/06/taylor-swift-jet-tracking-legal-threat/](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/02/06/taylor-swift-jet-tracking-legal-threat/)

泰勒·斯威夫特的律师已经对一位佛罗里达州大学生威胁提起法律诉讼，这位学生运营的社交媒体账户跟踪她和其他名人私人飞机的航班。

Jack Sweeney, a junior at the University of Central Florida, has for years run accounts that log the takeoffs and landings of planes and helicopters owned by hundreds of billionaires, politicians, Russian oligarchs and other public figures, along with estimates of their planet-warming emissions. The accounts use publicly available data from the Federal Aviation Administration and volunteer hobbyists who can track the aircraft via the signals they broadcast.
