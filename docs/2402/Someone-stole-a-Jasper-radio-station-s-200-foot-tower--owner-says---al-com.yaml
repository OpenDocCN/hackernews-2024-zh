    thieves made off with his 200-foot radio tower.

    call.

    tower was nowhere to be found.

    around,’’ Elmore said.

- en: The small transmitter building had also been vandalized. At Elmore’s direction,
    the landscaper looked inside and described what he saw – a wooden table, a metal
    chair, and a box fan.

    transmitter was gone.”

    “But it’s another thing to steal a 200-foot tower.”

    plant, which is surrounded by about 50 acres of woods. WJLX has five acres on
    the edge of that property.

    and there’s only one way in and one way out. It’s a dead-end road.”

    went to the Jasper Police Department to file the theft report.

    town.
  prefs: []

    from the FCC to keep the FM on the air while they get the tower rebuilt.

    a small market station.”

    on that property.

    assumes the tower will just be sold for scrap.

    there for so long, I don’t see them getting the bolts off,’’ he said. “They probably
    had to cut it off.”

    Elmore is hoping someone saw something or that something was captured on surveillance
    videos.
