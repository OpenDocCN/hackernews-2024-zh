- en: Windows 11 will soon have a built-in sudo command designed for developers. Sudo,
    short for “superuser do,” is widely used on Unix-based operating systems like
    Linux and macOS to run programs with higher security privileges or as another
    user. It’s useful for developers wanting to test scripts, for example.

- en: Microsoft is using sudo inside Windows to let developers run elevated tools
    directly from an unelevated console session. “It is an ergonomic and familiar
    solution for users who want to elevate a command without having to first open
    a new elevated console,” [explains Jordi Adoumie](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/commandline/introducing-sudo-for-windows/),
    a product manager at Microsoft.

    today, so it won’t be available to regular versions of Windows 11 until later
    this year. Microsoft will allow the sudo command to be configured in three modes:
    a new window, with input disabled, and inline. The most similar mode to Linux’s
    sudo is inline, whereas the other modes lock down things more.'

    for Windows and will be sharing more details about the security implications of
    running sudo in the ‘Inline’ configuration,” says Adoumie.

    a [full Linux kernel](/2019/5/6/18534687/microsoft-windows-10-linux-kernel-feature)
    in Windows 10\. The software maker has also added the [Bash shell to Windows](/2016/3/30/11331014/microsoft-windows-linux-ubuntu-bash), [native
    OpenSSH in Windows 10](/2017/12/14/16775764/microsoft-windows-10-openssh-client-support),
    and even brought Ubuntu, SUSE Linux, and Fedora to the Windows Store.
