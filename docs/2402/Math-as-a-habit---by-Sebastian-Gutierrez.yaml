- en: Just over 10 years ago, New York Times business reporter Charles Duhigg wrote
    a book called “The Power of Habit”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In it, Duhigg explains why habits exist and how they can be changed.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In the book, which is a fun and easy read, Duhigg puts together a simple model
    for how behaviors happen.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: habits are created by putting together a cue, a routine, and a reward, and then
    cultivating a craving that drives the loop
  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And then he breaks down how to establish habits and gives many examples you
    can use. Eventually, he writes a whole other book to give you even more information
    about how to put it to use.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: After reading the book, we implemented new habits into our family life.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Our kids love math, so helping them do what they love seemed like a good daily
    goal.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: However, life often got in the way, and we didn’t do enough math for them.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Making “doing math” a daily habit was a way to show them respect and honor their
    interests.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Once both kids had shown enough interest in math that it was apparent to us
    that we should give them more math, we decided to make doing daily math a habit.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The first thing we tried was being organized and establishing a “Time” Cue.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We tried to make it so that we would sit down and “do math” every day at 6 pm.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I put it in our family’s electronic calendar and had a reminder notification
    go off at the exact time every day.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Which somewhat worked, but mostly didn’t.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Sometimes, preparing dinner would take too long, so we started math at 6:30
    pm.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Sometimes, we needed to go to bed early because of a [thing] the next day, so
    we had to do baths/shower early, so we started math at 5:30 pm on those days.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Sometimes, we were out of the house and didn’t have our math.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Sometimes, the kids were sick and napped in the afternoon, so we did math at
    7:30 pm.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It slowly became a running joke that the notification was a notification of
    failure to do math rather than an invitation to sit down and do math.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Our “time cue” for the math habit was not working.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The next thing we tried was having a floating “Checkbox Streak” cue.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Given our schedule was a bit more varied than we had realized, we decided to
    establish a “streak”.

    find something related to habit-making called the “Seinfeld Strategy.”

    that day.*'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: From this, we decided to start a streak and keep count.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It’s been a few years, but we either made it to 108 days or 180 days of 10-30
    minutes of math a day.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The progress and the fun we had were spectacular.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But, and it’s a big one, the moment we fell off the streak, it broke completely.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you haven’t experienced it yourself, it’s one of the downfalls of this strategy.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Going back to having a 1-day streak compared to a 10-day, 50-day, 100-day, etc.
    streak is so daunting that most people (us included) find it hard to start again.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The guilt of failing the streak really hurts and that was it.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We didn’t do math for a while.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The kids still wanted to do the math, but things came up, and it was easy to
    say, “We’ll just do a bit extra tomorrow, and let’s not do it now.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The next thing we tried was habit stacking.
  prefs: []

    127 Small Changes to Improve Your Health, Wealth, and Happiness” by S.J. Scott.'

- en: Though a bit of a funny title, the main idea I took away is that it’s hard to
    start a new habit.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The solution is adding a new habit as part of an existing one.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One of the examples, if memory serves, is that you (probably) already brush
    your teeth every day.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So if you want to start drinking a glass of water in the morning as a new habit
    (which you should be doing if you’re not :) ), is that you put a glass next to
    your bathroom sink, and as soon as you finish brushing your teeth you drink a
    glass of water.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: BAM!
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now your two habits are tied together.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The “Cue” is an already existing habit that will happen automatically and eventually
    grow to encompass your new habit (drinking a glass of water).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So we took that idea and tied the “doing math” habit to the “doing bathtime
    at night” habit.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: While one kid is doing their bathtime routine, the other is doing math. Then
    when they finish, they swap places.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This worked for us.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It might work for you!
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Try to think of a “habit” your family already has in place and see if adding
    “math time” at the end of that habit would make sense.
