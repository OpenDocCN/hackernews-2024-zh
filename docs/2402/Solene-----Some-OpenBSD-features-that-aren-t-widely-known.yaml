    but not widespread.

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    on other BSD systems. Most of the knowledge will not be useful to Linux users.

- en: 2.1\. Secure level [§](#_Secure_level)
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The secure level is a sysctl named `kern.securelevel`, it has 4 different values
    from level -1 to level 2, and it's only possible to increase the level. By default,
    the system enters the secure level 1 when in multi-user (the default when booting
    a regular installation).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'It''s then possible to escalate to the last secure level (2), which will enable
    the following extra security:'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: all raw disks are read-only, so it's not possible to try to make a change to
    the storage devices
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the time is almost lock, it's only possible to modify the clock slowly by small
    steps (maybe 1 second max every so often)
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the PF firewall rules can't be modified, flushed or altered
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This feature is mostly useful for dedicated firewall with rules that rarely
    change. Preventing the time to change is really useful for remote logging as it
    allows being sure of "when" things happened, and you can be assured the past logs
    weren't modified.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The default security level 1 already enable some extra security like "immutable"
    and "append-only" file flags can't be removed, these overlooked flags (that can
    be applied with chflags) can lock down files to prevent anyone from modifying
    them. The append-only flag is really useful for logs because you can't modify
    the content, but this doesn't prevent adding new content, history can't be modified
    this way.

- en: OpenBSD's memory allocator can be tweaked, system-wide or per command, to add
    extra checks. This could be either used for security reasons or to look for memory
    allocation related bugs in a program (this is VERY common...).
  prefs: []

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    sysctl command, or at boot in `/etc/sysctl.conf` (make sure you quote its value
    there, some characters such as `>` will create troubles otherwise, been there...)

    (for security checks). It is stated in the man page that a program misbehaving
    with any flag other than X is buggy, so it's not YOUR fault if you use malloc
    options and the program is crashing (except if you wrote the code ;-) ).

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    or `*` to generate a random value that will remain stable until the crontab is
    reloaded. Things like `~/5` work. You can force the random value within a range
    with `20~40` to get values between 20 and 40.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'only run one instance of a job at a time: add `-s` between the time and the
    command, like in `* * * * * -s /bin/something`. This is incredibly useful for
    cron job that shouldn''t be running twice in parallel, if the job duration is
    longer than usual, you are ensured it will never start a new instance until the
    previous one is done.'
  prefs:

- en: 'no logging: add `-q` between the time and the command, like in `* * * * -q
    /bin/something`, the effect will be that this cron job will not be logged in `/var/cron/log`.'
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It's possible to use a combination of flags like `-ns`. The random time is useful
    when you have multiple systems, and you don't want them to all run a command at
    the same time, like in a case they would trigger a huge I/O on a remote server.
    This was created to prevent the usual `0 * * * * sleep $(( $RANDOM % 3600 )) &&
    something` that would run a sleep command for a random time up to an hour before
    running a command.

    media with pre-configured answers. This is done by injecting a specific file in
    the `bsd.rd` install kernel.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There is a simple tool named upobsd that was created by semarie@ to easily modify
    such bsd.rd file to include the autoinstall file, I forked the project to continue
    its maintenance.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In addition to automatically installing OpenBSD with users, ssh configuration,
    sets to install etc... it's also possible to add a site.tgz archive along with
    the usual sets archives that includes files you want to add to the system, this
    can include a script to run at first boot to trigger some automation!
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: These features are a must-have if you run OpenBSD in production, and you have
    many of them to manage, enrolling a new device to the fleet should be automated
    as possible.

    has features that aren't related to its command line flags, so you may have missed
    them.
  prefs: []

- en: There are different file names that can contain a script to be run upon some
    event such as suspend, resume, hibernate etc...
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A classic usage is to run `xlock` in one's X session on suspend, so the system
    will require a password on resume.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A bit similar to what apmd by running a script upon events, hotplugd is a service
    that allow running a script when a device is added / removed.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A typical use is to automatically mount an USB memory stick when plugged in
    the system, or start cups daemon when powering on your USB printer.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The script receives two parameters that represents the device class and device
    name, so you can use them in your script to know what was connected. The example
    provided in the man page is a good starting point.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The scripts aren't really straightforward to write, you need to make a precise
    list of hardware you expect and what to run for each, and don't forget to skip
    unknown hardware. Don't forget to make the scripts executable, otherwise it won't
    work.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Finally, there is a feature that looks pretty cool. In the daily script, if
    an OpenBSD partition `/altroot/` exists in `/etc/fstab` and the daily script environment
    has a variable `ROOTBACKUP=1`, the root partition will be duplicated to it. This
    permit keeping an extra root partition in sync with the main root partition. Obviously,
    it's more useful if the altroot partition is on another drive. The duplication
    is done with `dd`. You can look at the exact code by checking the script `/etc/daily`.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    a bootloader or created an EFI partition on the disk...

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: OpenBSD comes with a program named "talk", this creates a 1 to 1 chat with another
    user, either on the local system or a remote one (setup is more complicated).
    This is not asynchronous, the two users must be logged in the system to use `talk`.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    so fun, effective and easy to setup I wanted to write about it.
