    from level -1 to level 2, and it's only possible to increase the level. By default,
    the system enters the secure level 1 when in multi-user (the default when booting
    a regular installation).

    change. Preventing the time to change is really useful for remote logging as it
    allows being sure of "when" things happened, and you can be assured the past logs
    weren't modified.
  id: totrans-split-18
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The default security level 1 already enable some extra security like "immutable"
    and "append-only" file flags can't be removed, these overlooked flags (that can
    be applied with chflags) can lock down files to prevent anyone from modifying
    them. The append-only flag is really useful for logs because you can't modify
    the content, but this doesn't prevent adding new content, history can't be modified
    this way.

    permit keeping an extra root partition in sync with the main root partition. Obviously,
    it's more useful if the altroot partition is on another drive. The duplication
    is done with `dd`. You can look at the exact code by checking the script `/etc/daily`.
