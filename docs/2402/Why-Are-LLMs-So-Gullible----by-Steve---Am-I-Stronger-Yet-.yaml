  zh: 我相信开发者正在寻找解决方案。但越狱和提示注入源于LLM的基本属性。开发者可以向训练数据添加对抗性示例，他们还可以添加软件来检查聊天机器人的输入，看看它们是否似乎代表越狱企图。但这些可能只是部分改进，导致类似于电子邮件垃圾邮件和垃圾邮件过滤器之间的猫鼠游戏。游戏将继续，直到出现突破。这种突破可能需要LLM具有更丰富的世界理解能力，以便它们能够可靠地区分试图操纵它们的企图。
- en: So far, this is mostly all fun and games. LLMs are not yet capable enough, or
    being widely used in sufficiently sensitive applications, to allow for much harm
    when they fall for a trick. Anyone thinking of using LLMs in sensitive applications
    – including any application involving sensitive private data – should keep this
    in mind.

  zh: 到目前为止，这主要是一场游戏。LLM还不足以，或者说还没有广泛用于足够敏感的应用程序，以允许它们在被欺骗时造成大量损害。任何考虑在敏感应用中使用LLM的人士，包括涉及敏感私人数据的任何应用程序，都应牢记这一点。
