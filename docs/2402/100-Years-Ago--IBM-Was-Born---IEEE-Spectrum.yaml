- en: It’s true that the businesses that formed IBM began in the late 1800s. But it’s
    also true that a birth occurred in February 1924, with the renaming of the Computing-Tabulating-Recording
    Co. as the International Business Machines Corp. And a hundred years after that
    event, it serves as an important reminder that the world of computing and IT that
    IBM played a pivotal role in building has a longer history than we are likely
    to think. “Data processing” was coined over a century ago, while “office appliance”
    was in use in the 1880s. From the 19th century, through the 20th, and into the
    21st, IBM was there, making HP, [Microsoft](https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/microsoft),
    and Apple appear more like children or grandchildren of the IT world; [Facebook](https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/facebook),
    [Google](https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/google), and Twitter/X more like great-grandchildren.
    So let’s take a moment to contemplate the origins of an iconic corporation.

    enterprises—telecommunications, railroads, manufacturing—the need to coordinate
    the work of individuals and dispersed locations led to the mechanization of information.
    Hence the emergence of typewriters, adding machines, and cash registers. Time-recording
    devices tracked when workers arrived and left, while scales weighed everything
    from meat at a butcher shop to industrial machine parts. For the 1890 U.S. census,
    Herman Hollerith’s punch-card tabulators calculated the nation’s population.

    of them lost to history. But at least three survived. One came into being in 1900
    as the [International Time Recording Co.](https://www.ibm.com/history/international-time-recording),
    in Endicott, N.Y. ITR soon became known as *the* company for time-recording products
    in the United States and Canada. It had been formed and shaped by [Charles Flint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Ranlett_Flint),
    a dynamic character known for consolidating several companies into U.S. Rubber
    and several other companies into the American Chicle Co.—also known as the Chewing
    Gum Trust—and for his love of sailing and airplanes.

    technology that large enterprises and government agencies desperately needed,

    scales business was okay, the time-recording business was booming, and the tabulating
    business had enormous potential but had yet to demonstrate it could keep up with
    demand. The creation of C-T-R yielded a company with promise, but the three entities
    didn’t coordinate or leverage one another’s assets and talents.

    paired with competent sales, solid technology, and a growing international perspective.
    The previously disjointed three-legged operation increasingly embraced his notion
    of “speed, accuracy, and flexibility,” in which the customer always came first.

    In 1922, a recession year, C-T-R brought in only $9 million, but its staff had
    climbed to 3,043—solid evidence that Watson considered the recession a mere bump
    in the road. And for the next six decades, the company continued to grow. Not
    until the late 1980s did the company again face declining revenues (then measured
    in the billions of dollars) and a shrinking labor force (then in excess of 400,000).

    future without immediate threats of war, where large organizations had embraced
    the concept of data processing powered by mechanical devices. Watson oversaw a
    rapidly expanding company that was grabbing market share away from competitors.
    He concluded that C-T-R’s future lay in pursuing a worldwide strategy, one for
    which he now had enough factories, sales offices, and trained employees. To be
    sure—and this is an important lesson for today’s startups—it had taken him a decade
    to reach the point where he could sit comfortably in his office in New York and
    imagine the next phase of C-T-R.

    Watson and his colleagues spent the rest of the 1920s and 1930s creating a brand
    image that reflected their positive view and plans for the future but that also
    translated into transactions, profits, growth, and prestige. They battled ignorance
    of what their products could do, invented new products, hired people, expanded
    operations, overcame the worldwide tragedy of the Great Depression, and endured
    an antitrust challenge in the 1930s, the first of several.

    change after the adoption of the new name. Watson was declaring that IBM wanted
    to become a major player in its industry and a leading international corporation.
