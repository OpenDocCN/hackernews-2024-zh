    dangerous to use in C++. Here's a concrete example.

- en: Working on an internal library written in Rust, I had an error type for a parser
    that I wanted to be [`Clone`able](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/clone/trait.Clone.html),
    without duplicating the data inside. In Rust, this calls for a **r**eference-**c**ounted
    pointer, like [Rc](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/rc/struct.Rc.html).

    and moved on with my life.

    some inputs, so I decided I'd send the input to another thread via a [channel](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/sync/mpsc/fn.channel.html),
    and I'd get the response back through another channel, so that long orders wouldn't
    block the main thread.

    being sent between threads](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/rc/struct.Rc.html#impl-Send-for-Rc%3CT,+A%3E),
    as doing so would cause data races. Indeed, the reference count in `Rc` is not
    manipulated in an atomic manner that would be thread safe, it is using regular
    integer operations.

- en: As long as I didn't need reference counting to be atomic, I could use `Rc`.
    When I needed thread-safety, the compiler forced me to switch to `Arc` and the
    overhead of atomic reference counting. This is an illustration of the old principle
    of "don't pay for what you don't use".
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This principle is dear to the heart of C++ developers too, yet in stark contrast
    to Rust, C++ only has shared pointers with atomic reference counting in its standard
    library, that is the equivalent to `Arc`, not `Rc`. You always pay for the atomic
    even if you don't use it. Providing 2 classes was considered, but rejected, notably
    because [it was deemed too dangerous](https://stackoverflow.com/a/15140227/1614219)
    ("Code written with the unsynchronized `shared_ptr` may end up being used in threaded
    code down the road, ending up causing difficult to debug problems with no warning").

- en: On some C++ standard library implementations, there are attempts to recover
    the lost performance in some limited situations (e.g. the program as a whole is
    not multi-threaded), [to hilarious effect on micro-benchmarks](http://snf.github.io/2019/02/13/shared-ptr-optimization/).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Unfortunately the precaution taken by C++ of always having an atomic reference
    count is still insufficient to make `shared_ptr` safe in a multi-threaded context,
    as one should pay attention to a couple of the proverbial footguns.

- en: This is a bit of a subtle issue, and honestly I don't think I ever ran into
    that one, but I include it for clarity because sometimes people mix it with the
    second one.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You can take a `shared_ptr` and make a copy of it, calling its copy constructor,
    in a thread-safe way. What you cannot do, however, is share a single instance
    of a `shared_ptr` between multiple threads. Imagine having a struct containing
    a shared pointer that is shared between threads, and a method on that struct that
    reassigns the shared pointer. If that method is called unsynchronized by multiple
    threads, then this will result in undefined behavior.

- en: Apparently, this is enough of an issue that C++20 added a [partial template
    specialization to `std::atomic<std::shared_ptr>`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/memory/shared_ptr/atomic2).
    My advice, though, would be "don't do that!". Instead, keep your shared pointer
    in a single thread, and send copies to other threads as needed.

- en: Since assignment requires at an exclusive reference or an owned object, Rust
    statically forbids assigning to an `Arc` that is shared between multiple threads,
    avoiding the issue at compile time.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In a `shared_ptr`, only the reference counting is atomic, but the pointed-to
    object needs its own synchronization for writing and reading from different threads.
    This is a bit of a pitfall because it is tempting to simplify "`shared_ptr` is
    a thread-safely-referenced-counted pointer" to "`shared_ptr` is a thread-safe
    reference-counted pointer", while only the former is true.

    on the content of `Arc`, but [thanks](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/sync/struct.Arc.html#impl-Send-for-Arc%3CT,+A%3E)
    to [the `Send`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/marker/trait.Send.html) and [the
    `Sync`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/marker/trait.Sync.html) traits, and `Arc`
    only providing shared reference to its contents, writing and reading the pointed-to
    object unsynchronized is a compile-time error.

    system. It is the only language I used that can statically [prevent data races](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nomicon/races.html).
