# It is hard to avoid JavaScript | Alex Kutas blog

If you're doing anything web-related, you will face JavaScript. It's hard to avoid it and there's no simple substitution for it. I know all those frameworks can be overwhelming, CSS is tricky, and you might not like JavaScript syntax. This is how the current web works.

You can use whatever tool you find suitable: jQuery, React, Angular or even HTMX. You can use vanilla JS with no dependencies.

I see a lot of folks trying to avoid that simply because it's not considered a proper language. Sometimes, people get angry at React or other FrontEnd frameworks just because they look scary or too complex. But the reality is, FrontEnd is complex.

I've created **[HTMJS](https://htmjs.dev)** as a sarcastic way to express my thoughts. You can have JS in the way you want, just don't be too aggressive towards other people's choices.
