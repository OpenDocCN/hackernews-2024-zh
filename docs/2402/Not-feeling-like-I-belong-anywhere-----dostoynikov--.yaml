    of my father. There are plus 3 more cities I lived in due to different reasons,
    so at total I had lived in 9 different cities for my whole life. Oh, I didn't
    count Japan and Estonia by the way.

    to form up. It takes time. But once you feel like you get to that point, you move
    to another city and start a new life from zero. **So I always was that kid who
    obviously didn't belong to the group.**

    and I do not have any **friend** in a strong, real meaning. I have always envied
    people who have close friendships I saw around me, in the movies and the books,
    also the people who have grown up in a one place and formed a bond with a city.
