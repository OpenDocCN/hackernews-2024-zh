    a new interim CEO earlier this month, Mozilla, the organization behind the Firefox
    browser, is making some major changes to its product strategy, TechCrunch has
    learned.

    including its VPN, Relay and its Online Footprint Scrubber. Mozilla will also
    shut down [Hubs](https://hubs.mozilla.com/), the 3D virtual world it [launched](https://blog.mozvr.com/introducing-hubs-a-new-way-to-get-together-online/)
    back in 2018, and scale back its investment in its [mozilla.social](http://mozilla.social)
    Mastodon instance. The layoffs will affect roughly 60 employees. Bloomberg previously
    reported [the layoffs.](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/firefox-maker-mozilla-cutting-60-191639445.html)

    “trustworthy AI into Firefox.” To do so, it will bring together the teams that
    work on Pocket, Content and AI/Ml.

- en: Mozilla started expanding its product portfolio in recent years, all while its
    flagship product, Firefox, kept losing market share. And while the organization
    was often sharply criticized for this, its leadership argued that diversifying
    its product portfolio beyond Firefox was necessary to ensure Mozilla’s survival
    in the long run. Firefox, after all, provided the vast majority of Mozilla’s income,
    but it also meant the organization was essentially dependent on Google to continue
    this deal. With these changes, it now looks like Mozilla may refocus on Firefox
    once more, something that will surely make many hardcore Firefox fans quite happy.

- en: '**Scaling back investment [mozilla.social](http://mozilla.social/)**: With [mozilla.social](http://mozilla.social/),
    we made a big bet in 2023 to build a safer, better social media experience, based
    on Mastodon and the Fediverse. Our initial approach was based on a belief that
    Mozilla needed to quickly reach large scale in order to effectively shape the
    future of social media. It was a noble idea but one we struggled to execute. While
    we resourced [mozilla.social](http://mozilla.social/) heavily to pursue this ambitious
    idea, in retrospect a more modest approach would have enabled us to participate
    in the space with considerably greater agility. The actions we’re taking today
    will make this strategic correction, working through a much smaller team to participate
    in the Mastodon ecosystem and more rapidly bring smaller experiments to people
    that choose to live on the [mozilla.social](http://mozilla.social/) instance.'

    virtual worlds. With the exception of gaming, education, and a handful of niche
    use cases, demand has moved away from 3D virtual worlds. This is impacting all
    industry players. Hubs’ user and customer bases are not robust enough to justify
    continuing to dedicate resources against the headwinds of the unfavorable shift
    in demand. We will wind down the service and communicate a graceful exit plan
    to customers.'

- en: In 2023, generative AI began rapidly shifting the industry landscape. Mozilla
    seized an opportunity to bring trustworthy AI into Firefox, largely driven by
    the Fakespot acquisition and the product integration work that followed. Additionally,
    finding great content is still a critical use case for the internet. Therefore,
    as part of the changes today, we will be bringing together Pocket, Content, and
    the AI/ML teams supporting content with the Firefox Organization. More details
    on the specific organizational changes will follow shortly. Within MozProd, there
    are no changes within MDN, Ads, or Fakespot. There are also no changes to Legal/Policy,
    Finance & Business Operations, Marketing, or Strategy & Operations.
