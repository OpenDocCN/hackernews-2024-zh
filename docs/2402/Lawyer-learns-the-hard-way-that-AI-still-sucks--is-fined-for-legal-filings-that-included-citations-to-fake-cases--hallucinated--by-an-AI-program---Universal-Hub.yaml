    to realize something was amiss with a group of responses Marullo had submitted
    in opposition to filings by the police officers because the documents contained

    investigating the case law cited by Plaintiff's Counsel" but was unable to find

    degree in 1975, explained that an associate in his firm and two recent law-school
    graduates working for him had used an AI program - he said he did not know which
    one - and without his knowledge. He agreed that, yes, he had failed to "exercise
    due diligence" in checking the citations on filings with his name on them. He
    said he did not realize that AI systems could screw up like that.

    he added that other citations include additional typos or fail to support the
    argument the lawyer was making with them, which undercuts that to some extent.

- en: Making false statements to a court can, in appropriate circumstances, be grounds
    for disbarment or worse. ... The restrained sanction imposed here reflects the
    Court's acceptance, as previously noted, of Plaintiff's Counsel's representations

    an AI system had been used in the preparation of the [filings], and that the Fictitious
