    all-stock deal. It’s a very smart move and here is why:'

  zh: 上周，Capital One宣布以一项总值353亿美元的全股票交易达成协议，收购Discover Financial，震惊了投资者和金融界。这是一个非常明智的举动，原因如下：

- en: As a lender, most of Cap1’s revenue is related to credit risk. Essentially,
    the more profitable customers are usually the riskier. Finding lucrative customers
    without taking on too much risk is an art and a challenging endeavor which, if
    managed improperly, could inflict significant financial damage. With Discover,
    Cap1 can be an alternative network for other banks, generating “easy” money that
    is not based on managing credit risk. For reference, Visa has a gross and operating
    margin of 98% and 67% respectively, without having to obsess over whether a borrower
    is credit worthy. If you ran Capital One, would you welcome that kind of additional
    revenue?

  zh: 作为一家放贷机构，Cap1的大部分收入与信用风险相关。基本上，最赚钱的客户通常是最具风险的客户。在不承担过多风险的情况下找到有利可图的客户是一门艺术，也是一项具有挑战性的事业，如果管理不当，可能会造成重大财务损失。通过Discover，Cap1可以成为其他银行的备选网络，创造不依赖于管理信用风险的“轻松”收入。举例来说，Visa的毛利率和运营利润率分别为98%和67%，而无需过分关注借款人的信用状况。如果你管理Capital
    One，你会欢迎这种额外收入吗？
- en: As an issuer bank, Capital One earns interchange revenue from merchants on every
    transaction. In a deck presentation to investors, the bank said that owning a
    network enables them to work more closely with merchants and be more flexible,
    instead of being at the mercy of Visa or Mastercard. I get the sentiment, but
    I doubt they can realize this idea any time soon. The primary reason why I am
    skeptical is that merchants care more about the popularity of a network than anything
    else. If a network is not used by millions of consumers (like Discover), then
    what’s the point of new innovative features?

  zh: 作为发卡银行，Capital One从每笔交易中的商家处获得交换费收入。在向投资者的演示文稿中，该银行表示拥有一个网络使他们能够更紧密地与商家合作，更灵活地运作，而不是完全依赖于Visa或Mastercard的恩惠。我理解这种想法，但我怀疑他们能在短时间内实现这个想法。我怀疑的主要原因是，商家更关心一个网络的普及程度而不是其他任何东西。如果一个网络没有被数百万消费者使用（就像Discover一样），那么新的创新功能有什么意义呢？
- en: Additionally, because Discover is exempt from the Durbin rule, their debit interchange
    rates are not regulated like financial institutions with more than $10 billion
    in assets. Moving the debit purchase volume to the Discover network will result
    in meaning extra interchange revenue for Capital One. Let’s say, if the bank moves
    $150 billion of debit purchase volume over to Discover and earns 100 more basis
    points in interchange rates, the windfall will amount to $1.5 billion. Not bad,
    heh?

  zh: 此外，由于Discover免于Durbin法则的约束，其借记卡交换费率不像资产超过100亿美元的金融机构那样受到监管。将借记卡购买量转移到Discover网络将为Capital
    One带来额外的交换费收入。假设银行将1500亿美元的借记卡购买量转移到Discover，并提高100个基点的交换费率，则这一意外收入将达到15亿美元。还不错，对吧？
- en: Last but not least, this move can help Capital One prepare for the Credit Card
    Competition Act. The proposed law mandates that any card issuer with more than
    $100 billion in assets must use one other network in addition to Visa/Mastercard.
    Owning Discover will make Capital One a strong candidate for “the other network”
    and compete directly with American Express. Right now, the Act is still in limbo,
    but hey, it doesn’t hurt to have optionality.

  zh: 最后但同样重要的是，此举可帮助Capital One为信用卡竞争法案做准备。该提案法律要求资产超过1000亿美元的任何发卡行必须在Visa/Mastercard之外再使用另一网络。拥有Discover将使Capital
    One成为“另一网络”的强有力候选者，并直接与美国运通竞争。目前，该法案仍处于悬而未决状态，但嘿，保持多样选择也不会有害。

- en: The Discover brand is better known in the US than overseas. Between the two
    companies, Capital One is clearly THE master in marketing and branding, evidenced
    by its catchy “What’s in your wallet?” slogan and effective marketing campaigns
    . Hence, it makes sense to let the acquirer take the reins and market the Discover
    name globally. If the ultimate intention is to build a worthy alternative to Visa
    or Mastercard, there is no better option than letting Cap1 lead the combined entity.
    If Discover brings a payment rail to the table, Cap1 brings marketing expertise
    to help scale it.

  zh: 在美国，Discover品牌比在海外更为人熟知。在这两家公司之间，Capital One显然是市场营销和品牌方面的大师，如其引人入胜的“你的钱包里有什么？”口号和有效的营销活动所证明。因此，让收购方全球推广Discover品牌是合乎逻辑的。如果最终意图是建立一个与Visa或Mastercard相当的值得选择的替代方案，没有比让Capital
    One领导这个合并实体更好的选择。如果Discover提供支付系统，Capital One则提供市场营销专业知识来帮助扩展规模。
- en: 'In the credit card space, the two companies complement each other. Discover
    has a strong presence in the student and thin-file market, but lacks products
    in the high-end and co-brand segment. On the other hand, Cap1 has a decent affinity
    portfolio and is attacking the premium segment with the Venture line-up, new airport
    lounges and the acquisition of Velocity Black, a digital concierge company. As
    a result, the combined company has the capability to offer products to all consumers
    across the credit profile and income spectrum. Richard Fairbank made an interesting
    observation that further highlighted the strategic fit of this acquisition:'

  zh: 在信用卡领域，两家公司互补。Discover在学生和“薄档案”市场拥有强大的存在，但在高端和合作品牌市场缺乏产品。另一方面，Capital One在亲和度组合方面表现不错，并通过Venture系列产品、新机场休息室和收购数字礼宾公司Velocity
    Black攻击高端市场。因此，合并后的公司有能力向信用档案和收入范围内的所有消费者提供产品。理查德·费尔班克发表了一个有趣的观察，进一步突显了此次收购的战略契合：
- en: Discover has been more of a mid-market kind of broad national focus as opposed
    to going after the very top of the market. So in that sense, we don’t get a lot
    of scale on that. But we do — but still indirectly, we get a lift on things like
    brand scale because here’s the thing that we have found, **when we are advertising
    and pushing our heavy spender products it provides lift for the whole company
    because building an aspirational brand lifts all aspects of a company. So while
    it’s not a direct lift on our upper end strategy, it actually indirectly will
    provide quite a bit of scale benefit to that quest and that quest will absolutely
    continue**

  zh: Discover在市场上更多地关注中档国家范围，而不是追求市场顶端。所以从这个意义上说，我们在这方面并没有太多的规模优势。但间接地，我们在品牌规模等方面确实获得了提升，因为我们发现，当我们广告推广和推广我们的高消费者产品时，这会为整个公司带来提升，因为建立一个令人向往的品牌会提升公司的所有方面。因此，虽然这并不直接提升我们的顶端战略，但实际上它间接地会为这一追求带来相当多的规模利益，而这一追求将绝对持续下去。

- en: Bringing together the Capital One and Discover credit card businesses will unlock
    tremendous value as we take advantage of the benefits of scale in a business in
    which scale is critical. Scale really matters in consumer financial services.
    In addition to the classic operating scale, the business requires high levels
    of investment, which are independent of volume, underscoring the importance of
    technology scale, information scale and brand scale.

- en: The credit card business is — and I think this really applies to consumer financial
    services businesses in general, but certainly to credit cards, are very scale-driven,
    and I think, in many ways, more scale-driven than a lot of other parts of banking,
    for example, small business banking, even commercial banking tends to be a little
    bit more fragmented across many banks. But what’s happened on the consumer side,
    the reason there’s been more consolidation is just the underlying just incredible
    power and physics of scale.

  zh: 信用卡业务——我认为这实际上适用于消费金融服务业务，但当然也适用于信用卡——非常依赖规模效应，我认为在很多方面，比其他银行部门更加依赖规模效应，例如，小企业银行业务，甚至商业银行业务往往在多家银行间更加分散。但在消费者端发生的事情，更多的整合是因为规模效应的潜在力量和物理力量。
- en: And when you think about it, it’s — there’s obviously operating scale, but virtually
    every business has operating scale, but we’re talking about tens of millions of
    customers. When you get into those kind of numbers the scale economies become
    pretty big, but the operating scales, the less significant scale actually in the
    math to me compared to the — some of the things that have even a higher fixed
    cost component like tech scale, data scale, and brand scale.

- en: As the combined entity will have the largest credit card loan book in the US,
    it will have significantly increased bargaining power to negotiate with key partners.
    Visa and Mastercard will make concessions to compete for business from Capital
    One/Discover. Credit bureaus like Experian will also have to up their game and
    offer more finanlly friendly terms. Printing houses will surely offer discounts
    now that the mail volume from Capital One will grow significantly. Cloud providers,
    technology suppliers and marketing firms will also be more friendly.

  zh: 作为美国最大的信用卡贷款集团，合并后的实体将拥有最大的信用卡贷款业务，具有显著增强的议价能力，可以与关键合作伙伴进行谈判。Visa 和 Mastercard
    将作出让步，以争取 Capital One/Discover 的业务。像 Experian 这样的信用局也将不得不提供更加友好的金融条款。印刷公司肯定会提供折扣，因为从
    Capital One 的邮件量将显著增长。云服务提供商、技术供应商和营销公司也将更加友好。

- en: All in all, I think this is a smart move by Capital One. Very smart indeed.
    It shows the business is serious about challenging for the top spots in banking,
    credit card and payment networks. The question revolves around whether the deal
    will be approved by regulators. Two Senators (Hawley and Warren) already called
    for the deal to be nipped in the bud. However, I don’t think we can count out
    the possibility that the deal will go through. I suspect that the government could
    approve the deal because they hate the duopoly of Visa/Mastercard and want another
    player competing with those two giants.

  zh: 总的来说，我认为这是 Capital One 的明智之举。确实非常聪明。这表明该公司对争夺银行、信用卡和支付网络的前几名位置非常认真。问题在于这笔交易是否会得到监管机构的批准。两位参议员（霍利和沃伦）已经呼吁阻止这笔交易。然而，我认为我们不能排除这笔交易获得批准的可能性。我怀疑政府可能会批准这笔交易，因为他们厌恶
    Visa/Mastercard 的垄断地位，希望有另一家竞争这两家巨头的公司。
