# Issue 409 :: Haskell Weekly Newsletter

> 来源：[https://haskellweekly.news/issue/409.html](https://haskellweekly.news/issue/409.html)

> As some of you may have heard, Skills Matter, the organization that ran the Haskell eXchange for many years, is no longer running. Fortunately the Haskell Foundation was able to archive a significant majority of the Haskell-related videos before they became unavailable. This was done with the permission of Skills Matter, who provided us with the access. However, we have only the videos, we do not have descriptions or the name of the speaker. So we need your help organizing the material.
