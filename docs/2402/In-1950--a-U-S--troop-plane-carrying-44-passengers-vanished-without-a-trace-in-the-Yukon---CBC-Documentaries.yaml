    with 44 people on board. It took off in frigid cold with precious few hours of
    daylight left.

    30 minutes along the route. As the aircraft crossed into Yukon, they radioed the
    tiny outpost of Snag to say that there was ice forming on the wings, but otherwise,
    all was well.'

- en: The U.S. Air Force staged a huge search operation immediately after the plane
    was lost. Day by day, in the winter of 1950, newspapers around the world carried
    stories about the Skymaster, its passengers and the desperate rescue operation.
    The Yukon was covered with heavy snow as the temperatures plunged. U.S. and Canadian
    aircraft flew grid patterns all along the flight path, with spotters peering through
    frosted windows. It was chaotic — four of the search planes crashed.

    of Alaska to search for a missing bomber carrying a nuclear warhead. The families
    of the 44 people who missing with the Skymaster received death certificates. And
    the U.S. Air Force never returned to the Yukon to search again.

- en: The Douglas C-54 Skymaster had four engines, a 100' wingspan and a 26' high
    tail fin. Even in the massive expanse of the Yukon wilderness, it would be hard
    to hide a plane that big. Is it in a lake? At the bottom of a valley? Is there
    a chance that it flew off course and crashed into the mountains?
