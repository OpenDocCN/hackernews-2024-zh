- en: The police intelligence services unlawfully monitored entire population groups,
    the Supervisory Committee of the Intelligence and Security Services (CTIVD) said.
    In the four-month period between February 23 and July 1, 2022, they crossed that
    line three times, [NOS](https://nos.nl/artikel/2508037-inlichtingendiensten-onderzochten-onrechtmatig-hele-bevolkingsgroepen)
    reports.

- en: All police units throughout the Netherlands have their own intelligence service.
    They work with the general intelligence service AIVD and monitor people who could
    pose a threat to national security. According to the CTIVD, these intelligence
    services sometimes receive a signal “about a person or a few persons” and then
    decide to investigate an entire community based on that.

    due to the massive invasion of privacy that entails. The intelligence service
    must first look into obtaining information about suspects in a different way and
    carefully consider whether such a broad investigation is a proportionate matter.

    the CTIVD said. The supervisory body did not say which communities were involved
    but did explain that by “community,” it means a population group “based, for example,
    on ethnicity, religious belief, or occupational group.” So, theoretically, the
    police intelligence services may have been spying on visitors to a certain mosque
    or protesting farmers. The CTIVD did tell the “Stiekem Committee” - the parliamentary
    committee that supervises the CTIVD - which communities were involved.

    communities more often, but in these three cases, they did not give proper substantiation
    for why they needed to do so.

- en: 'Responsible Minister Hugo de Jonge (Home Affairs) said the police need to properly
    justify why they monitor entire communities. But he added: “I would like to emphasize
    that the approach of the investigations in all cases is focused on a threat perspective.”
    And then it may be necessary to get a picture of an entire community, which is
    allowed under certain conditions, he said. “It is inevitable that the ethnic background
    of people who are part of a particular community will be taken into account, but
    it is not the purpose of the investigation,” he said.'

- en: In response to the CTIVD revelation, D66 parliamentarian Joost Sneller demanded
    a broader debate in parliament about better supervision of the intelligence and
    security services. SP parliamentarian Michel van Nispen is also critical. “We
    already knew that individuals have been followed in a sloppy manner, but it is
    even worse for entire communities,” he said.
