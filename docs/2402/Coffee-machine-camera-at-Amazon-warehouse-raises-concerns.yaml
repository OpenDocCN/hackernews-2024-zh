  zh: 亚马逊正在替换 Maple Grove 仓库的休息室咖啡机，因为一名员工在咖啡机内部意外发现了会拍摄休息室照片的摄像头。
- en: The discovery alarmed a local nonprofit that works with East African workers,
    who comprise a sizable amount of Amazon’s Minnesota workforce. Local East African
    Muslim workers have a history of protesting the company’s wages and workplace
    conditions, including its handling of workers’ daily prayer practices and requests
    for time off for Muslim holidays.

- en: An employee at the DMP1 Amazon Delivery Station was getting coffee on February
    9 when he saw a button on the coffee vending machine’s touch screen that read
    “gallery,” according to Jonathan Canaday, a sortation associate who was working
    at the warehouse that day. The employee pushed the button and came across around
    half a dozen random photos of the breakroom, according to Canaday.

  zh: 在发现拍照的摄像头后，亚马逊管理层与员工就此问题进行了讨论，并立即联系了 Canteen，后者派工人前往仓库查看这台机器，卡罗尔说。本故事的 Canteen
    并没有回复留言。
- en: The discovery quickly “spread like wildfire” and created a “hubbub,” Canaday
    said, as Amazon workers flocked to the machine to see the pictures for themselves.
    Management quickly came to the scene to “triage the situation.”

  zh: 发现很快就“迅速传开”，引起了“骚动”，卡纳迪说，亚马逊的工人聚集在咖啡机旁亲眼看照片。管理层迅速赶到现场，进行“现场救治”。
- en: Abdirahman Muse, executive director of Awood Center, a labor organization that
    works with Minnesota’s East African community, said the situation is concerning
    because of previous incidents [where the retail giant used tech to track workers’
    productivity in excessive and illegal ways](https://apnews.com/article/amazon-fine-monitoring-workers-privacy-france-d503314234ccacb366e2afaa49d097b1).
    He said that Amazon workers must feel free to talk about work in the breakroom
    without the fear of being surveilled.

  zh: 明尼苏达州东非裔团体 Awood Center 的执行主任阿布迪拉曼·穆斯说，之前发生的情况令人担忧，原因是零售巨头以过度和非法的方式利用技术追踪工人的生产率。他说亚马逊员工必须在休息室自由谈论工作，而不必担心被监视。
- en: “East African workers organizing with the Awood Center have been raising concerns
    about invasion of their privacy by Amazon for years, advocating for improved working
    conditions,” Abdirahman said. “They’re seriously concerned about this recent allegation.”

- en: Amazon spokesperson Alisa Carroll said a malfunction caused the camera to take
    photos. The machine, provided by the vending supplier Canteen, features a touch
    screen and uses a camera for people to  purchase coffee with a card, she said.
    But Carroll added that Amazon offers the coffee to employees free of charge and
    has no practical use for the camera. The cameras cannot capture audio, she added.

  zh: 亚马逊发言人阿利萨·卡罗尔表示，摄像头的失灵导致拍摄照片。她说，自动售货供应商 Canteen 提供的这台售货机配备了触摸屏，并使用摄像头供人们用卡购买咖啡。但卡罗尔补充说，亚马逊向员工免费提供咖啡，并且对摄像头没有实际用途。她还说摄像头无法捕捉音频。
- en: Upon discovery of the camera taking pictures, Amazon management addressed the
    issue with employees and immediately contacted Canteen, which sent workers to
    the warehouse to take a look at the machine, Carroll said. Canteen did not return
    messages seeking comment for this story.

  zh: 这一发现使一个当地非营利组织感到震惊，该组织与东非裔工人合作，他们占了亚马逊明尼苏达州工作人口的很大比例。当地东非穆斯林工人曾经反对该公司的工资和工作条件，包括处理工人日常祈祷习惯和请假参加穆斯林节日的要求。

    the camera, as Amazon awaits a new coffee machine that either doesn’t have a camera
    or has a disabled camera, she said.

- en: 'The breakroom in question has two other cameras present: a security camera
    on the ceiling and another security camera attached to a self-checkout kiosk employees
    use when buying food, Canaday said. Employees are aware of both security cameras,
    which are clearly visible and expected, Canaday said.'

  zh: 问题所在的休息室还有两个其他摄像头：天花板上的一个安保摄像头和另一个附加在自助结账亭上的安保摄像头，员工在购买食品时使用。卡纳迪说，员工都知道这两个摄像头，摄像头是很明显可见的，也是预期之内的。
- en: Canaday said he and other employees felt that the coffee machine was intrusive,
    because employees weren’t aware of its camera and the pictures until the accidental
    discovery. Workers use the breakroom to decompress and talk about “anything from
    our own lives to our opinions of what is going on at work that day,” he said.

  zh: 2月9日，一名员工在 DMP1 亚马逊配送站制作咖啡时，发现咖啡售货机触摸屏上有一个标有“图库”的按钮，据当天在仓库工作的分捡员乔纳森·卡纳迪说。他按下按钮，发现了大约六张休息室的随机照片。
- en: “Since Amazon poses as a major tech company, it seems really negligent on their
    part to put a piece of machinery in their building that does something excessive
    like take pictures of the breakroom without people’s knowledge,” Canaday said.
    “We see there are security cameras around the building. That’s fine. But cameras
    in the coffee machine seem really duplicitous. It’s really upsetting.”

  zh: “由于亚马逊被冠以主要技术公司的身份，他们把一台像这样的机器放在建筑物里，做一些像在没有人知道的情况下拍摄休息室照片这样过分的事情，似乎是非常疏忽的，”Canaday说。“我们看到建筑周围有安全摄像头。那没关系。但是咖啡机里有摄像头似乎真的很奸诈。这真的很令人不安。”
- en: Canaday, who has worked for Amazon for the past year, estimates that the Maple
    Grove facility employs around 200 people, two-thirds of them people of color.
    He added that the same coffee machine is at other Minnesota warehouses, including
    one in Eagan and one in Centerville, which he recently helped open.

  zh: Canaday，在过去的一年里为亚马逊工作，估计Maple Grove工厂雇佣了约200人，其中三分之二是有色人种。他补充说，相同的咖啡机也放在明尼苏达的其他仓库，包括Eagan和Centerville，他最近帮助开设的仓库。
- en: Carroll said she wasn’t sure how many of the same machines were at other Amazon
    workplaces. Amazon doesn’t intend for its employees to feel vulnerable in any
    way, she added.
