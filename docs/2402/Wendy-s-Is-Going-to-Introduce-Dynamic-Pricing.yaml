    shared with analysts his various plans to increase company profits, including
    investing in digital menu boards that will have the capacity to display dynamic

  zh: 在二月初，温迪的新任CEO兼总裁Kirk Tanner向分析师们分享了他增加公司利润的各种计划，包括投资于数字菜单板，这些菜单板将能够显示到2025年日间按需波动的动态定价。
- en: “We are planning to invest approximately $20 million to roll out digital menu
    boards to all U.S. company-operated restaurants by the end of 2025,” Tanner said,
    according to [Nation’s Restaurant News](https://www.nrn.com/quick-service/wendy-s-expects-test-dynamic-pricing-and-daypart-offers-2025).
    Tanner added that Wendy’s will also invest an additional $10 million over two
    years to enhance its global system, help upsell other menu items, and improve
    order accuracy. But that’s not all.

  zh: “我们计划投资约2000万美元，到2025年底前在所有美国公司经营的餐厅推出数字菜单板，”Tanner在《Nation’s Restaurant News》上说道。Tanner补充说，温迪还将额外投资1000万美元，用于增强其全球系统，帮助提升其他菜单项目的销售，并提高订单准确性。但这并非全部。

- en: A spokesperson for Wendy's confirmed the news with Food & Wine, stating the
    company is focused on providing "great-tasting" food and is "making a significant
    investment" to grow its digital business, including rolling out digital menu boards
    in some U.S. restaurants. "Beginning as early as 2025, we will begin testing a
    variety of enhanced features on these digital menuboards like dynamic pricing,
    different offerings in certain parts of the day, AI-enabled menu changes and suggestive
    selling based on factors such as weather. Dynamic pricing can allow Wendy's to
    be competitive and flexible with pricing, motivate customers to visit and provide
    them with the food they love at a great value. We will test a number of features
    that we think will provide an enhanced customer and crew experience."

  zh: 温迪的一位发言人向《Food & Wine》确认了这一消息，表示公司专注于提供“口感极佳”的食品，并“大力投资”以发展其数字业务，其中包括在美国部分餐厅推出数字菜单板。“从2025年初开始，我们将开始在这些数字菜单板上测试各种增强功能，如动态定价、不同时段的不同优惠、基于天气等因素的AI菜单变更和建议销售。动态定价可以使温迪在价格上具备竞争力和灵活性，激励顾客光临，并为他们提供他们喜爱的美食以极具价值。”我们将测试一些我们认为将提升顾客和员工体验的功能。”

    Dynamic pricing, as defined by our friends at [Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/peak-pricing.asp#:~:text=Under%20a%20dynamic%20pricing%20strategy,pricing%20strategy%20called%20dynamic%20pricing.),
    allows companies to set variable pricing that can fluctuate up and down throughout
    the day, depending on demand. For example, if you’ve ever seen “surge pricing”
    on your Uber app, this is dynamic pricing.'

  zh: 如果这听起来像一大堆公司行话，让我们简单解释一下：根据我们在[Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/peak-pricing.asp#:~:text=Under%20a%20dynamic%20pricing%20strategy,pricing%20strategy%20called%20dynamic%20pricing.)的朋友定义，动态定价允许公司设定能够随需求波动的变动价格。例如，如果你在Uber应用中看到“高峰定价”，那就是动态定价。
- en: '"Businesses are able to change prices based on algorithms that take into account
    competitor pricing, supply, and demand, and other external factors in the market,”
    Investopedia explains. “Dynamic pricing is a common practice in several industries
    such as hospitality, travel, entertainment, retail, electricity, and public transport.
    Each industry takes a slightly different approach to repricing based on its needs
    and the demand for the product.”'

  zh: '"企业能够根据算法调整价格，考虑竞争对手的定价、供应、市场上的其他外部因素等。” Investopedia解释道。“动态定价在酒店业、旅游业、娱乐业、零售业、电力和公共交通等多个行业中是一种常见做法。每个行业根据其需求和产品需求量略有不同地重新定价。”'
- en: This means a Wendy’s burger may sell at a higher price point during a busy lunch
    rush, then come down in price during an afternoon lull, and go back up again at
    dinner time. And it’s not just Wendy’s who is thinking of adopting the practice.
    As [Nation’s Restaurant News](https://www.nrn.com/technology/why-restaurants-are-finally-adopting-dynamic-pricing-strategies)
    previously reported, during the 2022 Restaurant Finance and Development Conference,
    there was an entire panel discussion on how the restaurant industry could better
    adopt the system. The only caveat being, if customers will love it or loathe it.

  zh: 这意味着在忙碌的午餐高峰期，温迪汉堡可能以更高的价格销售，然后在下午的低谷期间降价，晚餐时间再次上涨。并且不仅仅是温迪，其他餐厅也在考虑采用这种做法。正如[Nation’s
    Restaurant News](https://www.nrn.com/technology/why-restaurants-are-finally-adopting-dynamic-pricing-strategies)先前报道的那样，在2022年餐饮金融与发展大会上，有一个完整的小组讨论关于餐饮行业如何更好地采用这一系统。唯一的限制是，顾客是否会喜欢或厌恶它。
- en: “Wendy’s foray into dynamic pricing is a bold experiment that could help the
    chain be more efficient and ultimately profitable if it works, " said Caleb Silver,
    editor in chief of Investopedia, shared with Food & Wine. “But, it does run the
    risk of angering and losing customers since they actually have many choices, unlike
    the rideshare industry.”

- en: “For us, it was all about consumer reaction. The concern was if you’re going
    to raise prices, you’re going to sell less product, and it turns out that really
    wasn’t the case,” Faizan Khan, a Dog Haus franchise owner, said at the Restaurant
    Finance and Development Conference. “I think there’s a lot of room for consumers
    in terms of price amounts they’re going to accept. Generationally, I think we’re
    seeing this being acceptable.” According to Khan, the entire idea could help “fill
    in” slower times and ease the burden on kitchen staff during peak hours, making
    every restaurant more profitable and sustainable from a human resource perspective
    throughout the day. Additionally, it gives consumers the chance to decide what
    they are willing to pay and when on any given day.

  zh: “对我们来说，这一切关乎消费者的反应。担心的是如果你提高价格，你会销售更少的产品，结果事实上并非如此，” Dog Haus连锁店的加盟店主Faizan
    Khan在餐饮金融与发展大会上说道。“我认为在价格数额上，消费者有很大的接受空间。从代际角度看，我认为我们正在看到这种情况是可以接受的。” 据Khan称，整个想法可以帮助“填补”低谷时段，减轻繁忙时段厨房人员的负担，使每家餐厅在一天之中从人力资源的角度更具盈利性和可持续性。此外，它给予消费者在任何给定日子决定何时以及愿意支付多少的机会。
- en: And Tanner really does seem dedicated to making Wendy’s the spot to be all day,
    rather than just lunch and dinner time. Beyond dynamic pricing, Tanner also shared
    on the call that the brand will be pushing its [breakfast program](https://www.foodandwine.com/wendys-launches-new-english-muffin-sandwiches-7643043)
    through a $55 million ad push spread over the next few years. “This investment,”
    he said, “will further amplify our plans and support and always-on approach across
    media partnerships and activations as we tell our breakfast story.” It’s hoping
    to see a 50% increase in breakfast sales over the next two years, so we’d venture
    a guess that you’ll likely see some great dynamic pricing deals coming for those
    meals too.

  zh: 并且 Tanner 确实似乎致力于使 Wendy’s 成为全天候的热门去处，而不仅仅是午餐和晚餐时间。除了动态定价，Tanner 在通话中还透露，品牌将通过未来几年分布在广告上的
    5500 万美元推广其[早餐计划](https://www.foodandwine.com/wendys-launches-new-english-muffin-sandwiches-7643043)。“这项投资，”他说，“将进一步增强我们的计划，并支持跨媒体合作伙伴关系和活动，同时讲述我们的早餐故事。”
    它希望在未来两年内看到早餐销售增长 50%，所以我们敢推测，你可能会看到一些针对这些餐点的优惠动态定价交易。
