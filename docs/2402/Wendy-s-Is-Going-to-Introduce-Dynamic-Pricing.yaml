- en: In early February, Kirk Tanner, the new CEO and president of [Wendy’s](https://www.foodandwine.com/chefs/im-a-chef-because-of-the-wendys-superbar),
    shared with analysts his various plans to increase company profits, including
    investing in digital menu boards that will have the capacity to display dynamic
    pricing that fluctuates throughout the day by 2025.

    boards to all U.S. company-operated restaurants by the end of 2025,” Tanner said,
    according to [Nation’s Restaurant News](https://www.nrn.com/quick-service/wendy-s-expects-test-dynamic-pricing-and-daypart-offers-2025).
    Tanner added that Wendy’s will also invest an additional $10 million over two
    years to enhance its global system, help upsell other menu items, and improve
    order accuracy. But that’s not all.

    features like dynamic pricing and daypart offerings along with AI-enabled menu

    company is focused on providing "great-tasting" food and is "making a significant
    investment" to grow its digital business, including rolling out digital menu boards
    in some U.S. restaurants. "Beginning as early as 2025, we will begin testing a
    variety of enhanced features on these digital menuboards like dynamic pricing,
    different offerings in certain parts of the day, AI-enabled menu changes and suggestive
    selling based on factors such as weather. Dynamic pricing can allow Wendy's to
    be competitive and flexible with pricing, motivate customers to visit and provide
    them with the food they love at a great value. We will test a number of features
    that we think will provide an enhanced customer and crew experience."

    Dynamic pricing, as defined by our friends at [Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/peak-pricing.asp#:~:text=Under%20a%20dynamic%20pricing%20strategy,pricing%20strategy%20called%20dynamic%20pricing.),
    allows companies to set variable pricing that can fluctuate up and down throughout
    the day, depending on demand. For example, if you’ve ever seen “surge pricing”
    on your Uber app, this is dynamic pricing.'

    competitor pricing, supply, and demand, and other external factors in the market,”
    Investopedia explains. “Dynamic pricing is a common practice in several industries
    such as hospitality, travel, entertainment, retail, electricity, and public transport.
    Each industry takes a slightly different approach to repricing based on its needs
    and the demand for the product.”'

    rush, then come down in price during an afternoon lull, and go back up again at
    dinner time. And it’s not just Wendy’s who is thinking of adopting the practice.
    As [Nation’s Restaurant News](https://www.nrn.com/technology/why-restaurants-are-finally-adopting-dynamic-pricing-strategies)
    previously reported, during the 2022 Restaurant Finance and Development Conference,
    there was an entire panel discussion on how the restaurant industry could better
    adopt the system. The only caveat being, if customers will love it or loathe it.

    chain be more efficient and ultimately profitable if it works, " said Caleb Silver,
    editor in chief of Investopedia, shared with Food & Wine. “But, it does run the
    risk of angering and losing customers since they actually have many choices, unlike
    the rideshare industry.”

    to raise prices, you’re going to sell less product, and it turns out that really
    wasn’t the case,” Faizan Khan, a Dog Haus franchise owner, said at the Restaurant
    Finance and Development Conference. “I think there’s a lot of room for consumers
    in terms of price amounts they’re going to accept. Generationally, I think we’re
    seeing this being acceptable.” According to Khan, the entire idea could help “fill
    in” slower times and ease the burden on kitchen staff during peak hours, making
    every restaurant more profitable and sustainable from a human resource perspective
    throughout the day. Additionally, it gives consumers the chance to decide what
    they are willing to pay and when on any given day.

    rather than just lunch and dinner time. Beyond dynamic pricing, Tanner also shared
    on the call that the brand will be pushing its [breakfast program](https://www.foodandwine.com/wendys-launches-new-english-muffin-sandwiches-7643043)
    through a $55 million ad push spread over the next few years. “This investment,”
    he said, “will further amplify our plans and support and always-on approach across
    media partnerships and activations as we tell our breakfast story.” It’s hoping
    to see a 50% increase in breakfast sales over the next two years, so we’d venture
    a guess that you’ll likely see some great dynamic pricing deals coming for those
    meals too.
