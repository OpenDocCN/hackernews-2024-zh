    extroversion. Americans weren’t just setting out to build new churches and new
    cities. Their associations were, as Alexis de Tocqueville wrote, “of a thousand
    different types … religious, moral, serious, futile, very general and very limited,
    immensely large and very minute.” Americans seemed adept at forming social groups:
    political associations, labor unions, local memberships. It was as if the continent
    itself had imbued its residents with a vibrant social metabolism—a verve for getting
    out and hanging out. “Nothing, in my view,” de Tocqueville wrote, “deserves more
    attention than the intellectual and moral associations in America.”'

    Americans moved less from place to place. They stopped showing up at their churches
    and temples. In the 1990s, the sociologist Robert Putnam recognized that America’s
    social metabolism was slowing down. In the book *Bowling Alone*, he gathered reams
    of statistical evidence to prove that America’s penchant for starting and joining
    associations appeared to be in free fall. Book clubs and bowling leagues were

    ages, for all ethnicities, and for all levels of income and education. Although
    COVID-19 clearly increased time alone, these trends predate the pandemic. The
    steepest declines have been among young people, poor people, and Black Americans.
    Women and 20-somethings enjoy the most social time in a given week, and low-income,
    middle-aged, unmarried men seem to get together the least. For most groups, the
    decline was staggered before accelerating after 2015\. Beyond in-person hanging,
    several other forms of socialization have declined by about a third in the past

- en: One of the more curious trends to jump out of the data is that many Americans
    have traded people for pets in our social time. The average time that Americans
    spend with their pets has roughly doubled in the past 20 years—both because more
    people have adopted pets and because they spend more time with them. In 2003,
    the typical female pet owner spent much more time socializing with humans than
    playing with her cat or dog. By 2022, this flipped, and the average woman with
    a pet now spends more time “actively engaged” with her pet than she spends hanging

- en: The first explanation is so obvious that it scarcely needs mentioning; in fact,
    I’ve already mentioned it. Americans are spending less time with other people
    because they’re spending more time with their screens—televisions and phones.
    The evidence that young people have replaced friend time with phone time is strong.
    As Twenge wrote in her book *Generations*, it’s not just that teens overall seem
    to have funneled their social lives into their smartphones. Even more telling,
    the groups with the largest increase in phone use, such as liberal 12th-grade
    girls, also saw the largest declines in hanging out with friends, strongly suggesting
    a direct relationship. For those who don’t accept that correlative evidence, we
    also have a 2019 randomized experiment from NYU and Stanford researchers who [found](https://web.stanford.edu/~gentzkow/research/facebook.pdf)
    that paying people to deactivate Facebook increased the time they spent socializing
    with friends. (It also increased the time they watch TV.)

    people in their 30s and 40s have less leisure time than they did two decades ago.
    As Anne Helen Petersen [has said](https://annehelen.substack.com/p/youd-be-happier-living-closer-to),
    Americans have a tendency to spread out, and the built environment of the U.S.
    housing market forces many people to move away from friends and family, which
    means they ultimately buy a bit of loneliness with their money.

    that time alone has increased most for low-income, nonwhite individuals, for whom
    hours worked haven’t increased much in the past 20 years. This would complicate
    the idea that loneliness is the price of overscheduled busyness. Twenge told me
    she’s also unconvinced by the argument about congested schedules, at least as
    it applies to teenagers. “Sometimes I’ll hear the case that teens are spending
    so much more time on homework, but the evidence suggests it’s just not true,”
    she said. “In fact, homework time has gone down in the past few years. The share
    of teens who have jobs has gone down. Despite some parents jam-packing their kids’
    schedules, overall extracurricular time looks pretty stable in surveys. If anything,
    teens today have more leisure time than they used to. They just choose to spend

- en: During my time picking through ATUS data, I was reminded of the Harvard Study
    of Adult Development, which is the oldest longitudinal study on happiness and
    well-being ever conducted. Last year, its directors [said](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/01/harvard-happiness-study-relationships/672753/)
    that the “simple and profound conclusion” of their work was that good relationships
    are the key to happiness. Just as many people are familiar with the concept of
    physical fitness, they said, we should be equally open to the concept of *social
    fitness*. We should care for our relationships as we’d care for our body.

    as caloric density and a built environment that discourages walking—have contributed
    to the surge in obesity. One interpretation of the rise in diet-related diseases
    is that humans are “dysevolved” for a modern food system so rich with carbs, sugars,
    and manufactured tastiness. Engineered to confront caloric scarcity, we’ve come
    up in a world of caloric abundance. The result of this mismatch is an obesity
    crisis and other calamities in physical fitness.

- en: One can imagine a similar framework to explain the deterioration of America’s
    social fitness. We come into this world craving the presence of others. But a
    few modern trends—a sprawling built environment, the decline of church, social
    mobility that moves people away from friends and family—spread us out as adults
    in a way that invites disconnection. Meanwhile, as an evolutionary hangover from
    a more dangerous world, we are exquisitely engineered to pay attention to spectacle
    and catastrophe. But screens have replaced a chunk of our physical-world experience
    with a digital simulacrum that has enough spectacle and catastrophe to capture
    hours of our greedy attention. These devices so absorb us that it’s very difficult
    to engage with them and be present with other people.

  zh: 可以想象一个类似的框架来解释美国社会适应能力的恶化。我们来到这个世界上渴望他人的存在。但一些现代趋势——如庞大的建筑环境、教会的衰退、社会流动性使人们远离朋友和家人——在成年后将我们分散开来，促使我们陷入断裂状态。同时，作为更危险世界的进化遗留，我们精细地设计出来关注壮观和灾难。但屏幕已经用数字仿真物取代了我们在现实世界中的部分体验，足以吸引我们贪婪的注意力。这些设备如此吸引我们，以至于很难与它们互动并与他人保持在场。
- en: The sum result of these trends is that we are both pushed and pulled toward
    a level of aloneness for which we are dysevolved and emotionally unprepared. Sartre
    said hell is other people. Perhaps. But the alternative is worse.

  zh: 这些趋势的总体结果是，我们被推向和拉向一种我们在进化上不适应和情感上不准备的孤独境地。萨特说地狱就是别人。也许。但另一种选择更糟。
