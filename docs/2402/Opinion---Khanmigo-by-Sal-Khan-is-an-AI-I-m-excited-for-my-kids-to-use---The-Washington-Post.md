# Opinion | Khanmigo by Sal Khan is an AI I’m excited for my kids to use - The Washington Post

Remember when [people were furious](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/08/13/ai-chatgpt-chatbots-college-cheating/?itid=lk_inline_manual_1) about kids using ChatGPT to cheat on their homework? If I may be so bold as to psychoanalyze the United States of America, it’s possible the hysteria was not entirely about homework but also the speed with which artificial intelligence was infiltrating our daily lives. How else do you explain so many people defending the sanctity of a thing none of them ever wanted to do?
