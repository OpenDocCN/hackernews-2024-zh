- en: This book falls squarely within the Marxist political-economic tradition. I
    wrote it as a piece of Marxist scholarship. So, from my Marxist perspective, this
    is a tragic book to have to write.

- en: 'The contradictions of capitalism didn’t lead to the anticipated resolution
    where, after all these centuries of class stratification, society would be distilled
    into two classes, poised for a high-noon clash. This decisive confrontation between
    oppressor and oppressed would result in the liberation of humanity — the emancipation
    of humanity from all class conflict. Instead of that, however, this clash between
    the capitalist — the bourgeoisie — and the proletariat ended up in the complete
    victory of the bourgeoisie: a complete loss after 1991, especially.'

    class — capitalism went into a rampant dynamic evolution that caused this mutation
    into what I call cloud capital. This transformation effectively marked the end
    of traditional capitalism. It killed capitalism — a development that embodies
    a Marxist-Hegelian contradiction, but not the kind of contradiction we would have
    hoped for.

- en: Cloud capital has killed off markets and replaced them with a kind of a digital
    fiefdom where not just proletarians — the precarious — but bourgeois people and
    vassal capitalists are all producing surplus value for the vassal capitalists.
    They are producing rents. They’re producing cloud rent, because the fiefdom is
    a cloud fiefdom now, for the owners of cloud capital.

- en: Cloud capital created a kind of power, which we as Marxists must recognize as
    being structurally, qualitatively different from the monopoly power of somebody
    like Henry Ford, Thomas Edison, or the great robber barons. Because those people
    concentrated capital, concentrated power, bought out governments, and killed off
    their competitors to sell their stuff. Today’s “cloudalists” — cloud capital owners
    — they don’t even care about producing anything and selling their stuff. This
    is because they have replaced markets — they have not simply monopolized them.

- en: If capitalism is market-based and profit-driven, well then this is no longer
    capitalism, because this is not marketplace-based. It’s based on digital platforms
    that are closer to techno-fiefdoms or cloud fiefdoms, and they’re driven by two
    forms of liquidity. One is cloud rent, which is the opposite of profit, and the
    other is central bank money, which funded the building of cloud capital. And that
    is not capitalism.

    and if you say that anything that stems from the power of capital is capitalism,
    but it’s not capitalism as we’ve known it. To paraphrase Spock in Star Trek: “It
    is life but not life as we’ve known it.”'

    “capitalism” to something else, which is very difficult to make, because we’re
    all wedded to the idea that we’re fighting against capitalism. After all those
    decades of feeling that we came to this planet to overthrow capitalism, it’s really
    very difficult to have an idiot like me coming along and saying, “But this is
    not capitalism anymore.” You say, “Bugger off. Of course it is capitalism. If
    it’s not socialism, it must be capitalism.” That’s what a fellow Marxist said
    to me. And I killed myself laughing because I remember my Rosa Luxembourg. No,
    it can be barbarism.
