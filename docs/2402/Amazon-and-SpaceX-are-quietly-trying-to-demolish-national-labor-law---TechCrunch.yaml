    to [block union organizing](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/16/technology/amazon-unions-virginia.html)
    in its fulfillment centers. But this time, these companies aren’t just limiting
    the rights of their own workers. If these threats against the NLRB keep moving
    forward, American workers could lose workplace protections that they’ve had for
    almost a century.

    United and the Amazon Labor Union. “I don’t believe any of it, and I think it’s
    just a cover to bust unions.”

- en: Amazon claims that the NLRB’s structure is unconstitutional because administrative
    law judges are “insulated from presidential oversight,” thus violating the separation
    of powers. The company also argues against the structure of NLRB itself, as well
    as its ability to fine a company for unfair labor practices after a hearing, rather
    than a full jury trial.

    can’t remove federal judges,” Goldstein told TechCrunch. The complaint about a
    lack of jury trials for companies may seem less dubious, but Goldstein still thinks
    it’s a stretch. “At the end of the day, the courts do have jurisdiction over decisions
    by the board. So what are they complaining about?”

    Under President Joe Biden, who [refers to himself](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/09/01/fact-sheet-ahead-of-labor-day-biden-harris-administration-announces-new-actions-to-empower-workers-building-on-the-presidents-historic-support-for-workers-and-unions/)
    as pro-worker, the NLRB has been [friendly](https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/nlrb-paves-way-workers-unionize-without-formal-elections-2023-08-25/)
    toward workers’ causes. But as the 2024 election looms, a Republican administration
    could significantly change that, making it more likely for corporations to be
    successful in attempts to strike down long-standing labor law.
