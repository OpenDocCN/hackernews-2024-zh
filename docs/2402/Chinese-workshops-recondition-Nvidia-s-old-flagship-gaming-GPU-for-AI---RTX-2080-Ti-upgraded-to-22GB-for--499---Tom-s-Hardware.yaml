    was once among the [best graphics cards](https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/best-gpus,4380.html)
    gamers can buy. While some of us may have forgotten about the six-year-old graphics
    card, the Turing-based flagship is making a comeback in China. Amidst the AI boom,
    Chinese workshops (via [I_Leak_VN](https://x.com/I_Leak_VN/status/1758113491183886387?s=20))
    are repurposing the GeForce RTX 2080 Ti into AI accelerators by doubling the memory
    from 11GB to 22GB.

- en: The problem with salvaging old graphics cards is the stock. With [Ada Lovelace](https://www.tomshardware.com/features/nvidia-ada-lovelace-and-geforce-rtx-40-series-everything-we-know)
    having been out for almost two years, it's hard to find any significant Ampere
    stock around. So, what's the next move? Go back another generation. The Chinese
    workshops now focus on the GeForce RTX 2080 Ti. The only modification they are
    making to the Turing graphics card is doubling the memory from 11GB to 22GB to
    turn them into viable AI accelerators. There's a long precedence of user mods
    that swap out existing GDDR6 chips for higher-capacity ones on Turing. One enthusiast
    outfitted a [GeForce RTX 2080 Ti with 44GB of VRAM](https://www.tomshardware.com/news/geforce-rtx-2080-ti-gets-44gb-vram-through-user-mod)
    not so long ago, so VRAM modification and upgrades aren't something from another
    universe.

    the seller, who goes back by Aisawk, reportedly utilizes original Samsung GDDR6
    chips and high-quality ALPHA OM-367 solder paste for the modification. He also
    claims that the modified GeForce RTX 2080 Ti will not face any Nvidia driver issues
    as the graphics card is seemingly supported and working without vBIOS modifications.

- en: The photographs showed that the merchant is utilizing [MSI](https://www.tomshardware.com/tag/msi-microstar)'s
    GeForce RTX 2080 Ti Aero 11GB for the project. The reason is likely due to the
    graphics card's blower-type design, allowing consumers to use multiple graphics
    cards in the same system. It's not the only model that the seller offers, though.
    He also shared autographs of a Founders Edition design. Besides selling the altered
    graphics card, the Goofish seller also offers an upgrade service for $120, which
    includes labor and materials, for GeForce RTX 2080 Ti owners who want to send
    in their graphics card for the 22GB modification.

    2080 Ti Aero 11GB进行项目。原因很可能是由于该显卡的吹风式设计，使消费者可以在同一系统中使用多个显卡。不过，他提供的不止这一款型号。他还分享了创始人版设计的签名。除了销售改装后的显卡外，Goofish商家还提供了一项升级服务，售价为120美元，包括人工和材料，供希望将自己的GeForce
    RTX 2080 Ti显卡送修进行22GB改装的用户。

    customgpu_official, an upgrade and repair store in Palo Alto, California, sells
    a similar MSI GeForce RTX 2080 Ti Aero with 22GB for [$499](https://www.ebay.com/itm/256351082761?mkevt=1&mkcid=1&mkrid=711-53200-19255-0&campid=5337827784&customid=tomshardware-us-1251731536163463900).
    The store is touting the graphics card as a budget alternative for students and
    startups that want to get their feet wet in AI workloads. The graphics card is
    allegedly stable in Stable diffusion, large language models (LLMs), and Llama
    2\. According to the merchant's [website](https://2080ti22g.com/), it has sold
    over 500 units of the GeForce RTX 2080 Ti 22GB.

    customgpu_official，以499美元的价格销售类似的MSI GeForce RTX 2080 Ti Aero，带有22GB内存。该商店将这款显卡宣传为学生和初创企业的预算替代品，他们希望在AI工作负载中有所尝试。据商家的[网站](https://2080ti22g.com/)称，该显卡已售出超过500台。
- en: The GeForce RTX 2080 Ti 22GB may not be a bad deal. At $499, it has 6GB more
    memory than a [GeForce RTX 4070 Ti Super](https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4070-ti-super-review),
    costing $300 less or 2GB more than the [Radeon RX 7900 XT](https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/amd-radeon-rx-7900-xtx-and-xt-review-shooting-for-the-top)

    you don't know if the graphics card was new to start with and the warranty.

- en: While the GeForce RTX 2080 Ti 22GB offers abundant memory for AI and deep learning
    training for an attractive price, you never know how long the graphics card will
    last you. For example, customgpu_official only offers a 30-day warranty with a
    free exchange for a malfunctioning graphics card. After that period, you're practically
    on your own. So, while saving a few bucks today, you may lose your entire investment
    in a few months if you're unlucky.

  zh: 虽然GeForce RTX 2080 Ti 22GB以有吸引力的价格为AI和深度学习培训提供了丰富的内存，但你永远不知道这款显卡能用多久。例如，customgpu_official只提供30天的保修期，且在故障显卡免费更换。在此期限之后，你几乎自行承担风险。所以，虽然今天省了几个钱，如果不幸的话，几个月后你可能会失去整个投资。
