- en: In 2010, Eric DuBarry and his two-year-old son Seamus were crossing a street
    in Portland, Oregon, when an elderly driver mistook the accelerator for the brake,
    and ploughed into the pair and another man. They were flung across the street—the
    pram wrapping itself around a lamppost. In hospital that evening, Michelle DuBarry,
    Seamus’s mother, recalls “this realisation of, my God, how are we going to pay
    for this?” The day after the crash, Seamus died. The hospital charged the couple’s
    insurance $180,000 for his care. The DuBarrys had to raise $4,500 of that themselves;
    and had no coverage for the time off work they had to take. Ms DuBarry thought
    that at least the driver’s car insurance would pay for some of those costs.

    Seamus had just $100,000 of liability coverage per victim. Before the DuBarrys
    saw a penny, their health and car insurers claimed the entire amount to cover
    their costs. Eventually, with the help of a lawyer, they clawed some back. But,
    says Ms DuBarry, “I still was just left with this feeling: How can it be this
    hard?”'
