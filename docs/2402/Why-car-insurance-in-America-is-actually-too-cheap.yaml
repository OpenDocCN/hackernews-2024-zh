- en: In 2010, Eric DuBarry and his two-year-old son Seamus were crossing a street
    in Portland, Oregon, when an elderly driver mistook the accelerator for the brake,
    and ploughed into the pair and another man. They were flung across the street—the
    pram wrapping itself around a lamppost. In hospital that evening, Michelle DuBarry,
    Seamus’s mother, recalls “this realisation of, my God, how are we going to pay
    for this?” The day after the crash, Seamus died. The hospital charged the couple’s
    insurance $180,000 for his care. The DuBarrys had to raise $4,500 of that themselves;
    and had no coverage for the time off work they had to take. Ms DuBarry thought
    that at least the driver’s car insurance would pay for some of those costs.

  zh: 2010年，埃里克·杜巴瑞和他两岁的儿子西莫斯在俄勒冈州波特兰市穿过街道时，一名年迈的司机误把油门当刹车，撞向了他们和另一名男子。他们被甩到了街对面——婴儿车缠绕在路灯柱上。当晚在医院，西莫斯的母亲米歇尔·杜巴瑞回忆道：“我意识到，天哪，我们该怎么支付这些费用？”撞车的第二天，西莫斯去世了。医院为他的护理向夫妇的保险公司收费了$180,000。杜巴瑞夫妇自己必须筹集$4,500；他们没有覆盖他们不得不休假的时间。杜巴瑞女士认为至少司机的汽车保险会支付部分费用。
- en: 'She quickly discovered that there was little hope of that. The driver who killed
    Seamus had just $100,000 of liability coverage per victim. Before the DuBarrys
    saw a penny, their health and car insurers claimed the entire amount to cover
    their costs. Eventually, with the help of a lawyer, they clawed some back. But,
    says Ms DuBarry, “I still was just left with this feeling: How can it be this
    hard?”'

  zh: 她很快发现几乎没有希望。撞死西莫斯的司机每个受害者只有$100,000的责任保险。在杜巴瑞夫妇看到一分钱之前，他们的健康和汽车保险公司就要求支付整个金额来支付他们的费用。最终，在律师的帮助下，他们挽回了一些损失。但是，杜巴瑞女士说：“我仍然只剩下这种感觉：为什么会这么难？”
