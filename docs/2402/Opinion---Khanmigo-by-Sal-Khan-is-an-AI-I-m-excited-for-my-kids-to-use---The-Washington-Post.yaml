    about kids using ChatGPT to cheat on their homework? If I may be so bold as to
    psychoanalyze the United States of America, it’s possible the hysteria was not
    entirely about homework but also the speed with which artificial intelligence
    was infiltrating our daily lives. How else do you explain so many people defending
    the sanctity of a thing none of them ever wanted to do?
