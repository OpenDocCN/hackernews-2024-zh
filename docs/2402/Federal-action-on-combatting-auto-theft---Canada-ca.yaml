    partners to disrupt, investigate and ultimately prosecute these crimes. Upfront,
    preventative and investigative work—within Canada, ahead of reaching the border—is
    imperative to reduce auto theft overall. The CBSA acts on 100% of referrals from
    local police and works closely with governments and jurisdictions to intercept
    stolen vehicles and identify criminal activity within the supply chain.
