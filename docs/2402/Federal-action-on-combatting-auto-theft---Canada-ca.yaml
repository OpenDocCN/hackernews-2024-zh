    partners to disrupt, investigate and ultimately prosecute these crimes. Upfront,
    preventative and investigative work—within Canada, ahead of reaching the border—is
    imperative to reduce auto theft overall. The CBSA acts on 100% of referrals from
    local police and works closely with governments and jurisdictions to intercept
    stolen vehicles and identify criminal activity within the supply chain.

    Canada has a robust criminal law framework to address auto theft at various stages
    of the crime, as well as its links to organized crime. The Department of Justice
    Canada will, in consultation with provinces and territories, examine potential
    amendments to the *Criminal Code* to further strengthen the legal framework related
    to auto theft, including by reviewing existing offences and penalties.
