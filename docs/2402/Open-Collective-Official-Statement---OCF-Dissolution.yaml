    decision to dissolve, effective December 31\. The full content of their announcement,
    which came as a surprise to us, can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1odj1zfwqZgIyGOeBhv5QZxYHn422VOMdo32i3T3CPps/edit?usp=sharing&ref=blog.opencollective.com),
    and they have also created [an FAQ](https://docs.opencollective.foundation/?ref=blog.opencollective.com).
    We are still grappling with the realities of this decision, which has sent subsequent
    shock waves through the Open Collective ecosystem and community.

    While the above four organizations have historically been close partners, as they
    have grown, they have also become more and more distinct from one another, and
    are completely separate in their functions, despite their similarities in name
    and branding. Thus, **Open Collective Foundation has made this decision completely
    independently.**

    It appears that, despite our shared efforts, OCF has not found a viable and sustainable
    path forward. The exact specifics of OCF’s decision to dissolve are not known
    to us. We have to trust that OCF had a good reason to do this, but still, we cannot
    help but be deeply saddened that this has happened.
