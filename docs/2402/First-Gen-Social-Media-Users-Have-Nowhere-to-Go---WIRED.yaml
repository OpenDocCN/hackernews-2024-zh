- en: A golden age of connectivity is ending. “I deleted my Facebook years ago, spend
    at least three to six months off Twitter every year, and Bluesky invites are just
    sitting in my inbox,” a friend tells me when I ask how her relationship to social
    media has changed in recent times. “I basically only use [Instagram] Stories and
    almost never post on the grid. I do it once a week so I can get away with saying
    ‘Free Palestine’ without the algorithm punishing me. I refuse to get any more
    accounts. I’m over it.”

    of social media that redefined community building and digital correspondence.
    For many first-gen social media users—millennials between the ages of 27 and 42—there
    is a developing sentiment that the [party is over](https://www.wired.com/story/social-media-has-run-out-of-fresh-ideas/).

    and fitness tips. TikTok, what originally felt like a glossier alternative to
    YouTube, increasingly resembles an outlet mall [full of “dupes,”](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/10/31/gen-z-millennials-are-shopping-for-dupes-the-most-report-finds.html)
    prizing hype over lasting influence.

    in Silicon Valley to fill the gulf its collapse is leaving. I''ve spent an unhealthy
    amount of time on the platform over the last decade. It was the avenue of the
    Black Lives Matter movement, a megaphone for everyday users, and, through a wave
    of history-setting and history-unsettling US elections, transformed culture into
    a 24/7 participatory event. There is no #MeToo without Twitter, nor the beginnings
    of a [racial reckoning in Hollywood](https://www.wired.com/2016/01/pretty-much-only-white-people-got-oscar-nominations-again/).
    Twitter refashioned the look of communication through a vernacular of memes and
    GIFs, where resident collectives like [Black Twitter](https://www.wired.com/story/black-twitter-oral-history-part-i-coming-together/)
    and NBA Twitter excelled as virtuosos of the form.'

    he has [taken a sledgehammer](https://twitter.com/jeremypgordon/status/1677424940956393473)
    to everything that gave the platform its unique draw (issues of safety and inclusion
    were a problem under former CEO Jack Dorsey but have significantly worsened).
    There is a void in the social media universe that, until now, Twitter singularly
    occupied.

    views reoriented how users interacted with one another, no other platform offered
    what Twitter did, the way it did: up-to-the-second real-time conversation and
    analysis. It was a blank slate, and because it was a blank slate, it was a canvas
    to document what was happening to us and around us. It was revolutionary, and
    soon what we remember of it will be gone.'

- en: If the early promise of social media was to bring society closer to a virtual
    ideal, the most recent shift in how platforms are used has lost the plot. Along
    with Twitter, the erosion of the user experience on Facebook and Instagram—with
    tiered subscriptions, a proliferation of hate speech and misinformation, privacy
    [being sold](https://www.wired.com/story/meta-facebook-pay-for-privacy-europe/)
    as a luxury, and the threat of generative AI—marks a sharp turning point in the
    value of the social web. It’s “too much echo chamber,” my friend says of what
    the social internet has evolved into. “It’s too much viewing people you know in
    real life as marketing categories.” Everything about the current online user experience,
    she says, is “too mind-melting.”

    by the “appearance of social connection,” says Marlon Twyman II, a quantitative
    social scientist at USC Annenberg who specializes in social network analysis.
    “Human relationships have suffered and their complexity has diminished. Because
    many of our interactions are now occurring in platforms designed to promote transactional
    interactions that provide feedback in the form of attention metrics, many people
    do not have much experience or practice interacting with people in settings where
    there are collective or communal goals for a larger group.” This has also led
    to people being more image-conscious and identity-focused in real-world interactions,
    too, Twyman adds.
