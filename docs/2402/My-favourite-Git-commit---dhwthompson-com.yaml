    It’s from a developer by the name of [Dan Carley](https://twitter.com/dancarley),
    and it has the rather unassuming name of “[Convert template to US-ASCII to fix
    error](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-puppet/commit/63b36f93bf75a848e2125008aa1e880c5861cf46)”.

    the organisation that produced them. I’m not sure who first introduced that idea
    to GDS – it was well-established by the time I joined – but I’m forever grateful
    to them.'

    commit messages can do. It’s fun because of the ratio of commit message to code
    change, but that’s not why I think it’s worth sharing.

    message might have been `change whitespace`, or `fix bug`, or (depending on the
    team’s culture) some less than flattering opinions about the inventor of the non-breaking
    space. Instead, Dan took the time to craft a really useful commit message for
    the benefit of those around him. I’d like to step through a few of the ways I
    think this is a really good example.
