# HOW TO STUDY

 ### 3.6\. Copy Your Notes at Home

Recall that this section was titled "Take Notes in Class & *Rewrite* Them at Home".

The title was *not* "Take Notes in Class & *Study* Them at Home".

Of course you should study your class notes at home; but just (re-)*reading* them is too passive.

One of the themes of this guide is that

It is all too easy when *just* reading passively to have your mind wander or even to fall asleep:

Moreover, notes are often incomplete or sketchy; just reading such notes won't help. And a few days or months after you take them, they may very well be illegible or incomprehensible. Finally, if you don't do something active with your notes, you run the risks of having unorganized notes or of misplacing them.

What I suggest is that you **study your notes by re-writing them**:

*   For each class, buy a separate notebook from the one you take your notes in. I recommend a "composition" or spiral notebook, not a looseleaf notebook, for your "permanent" (i.e., re-written) notes.
*   Then, as soon as possible after class (preferably that evening or the next), copy your notes into your permanent notebook. 

The main idea behind re-writing your "raw" class notes (besides making them more legible and organized) is that the very act of copying them is one of the best ways of studying them! Further study of your class notes can then be done from these "cooked" ones that are neater, more legible, more organized, and more complete. I will suggest ways to do this [later](https://cse.buffalo.edu/~rapaport/howtostudy.html#examstudy).

Use this opportunity to fill in gaps from your memory while they are still fresh in mind. You may find that you have questions, perhaps something you missed or don't understand, or even a "substantive" question. If so, good! Make a note of your question and ask it in class next time!

Use this opportunity to (re-)organize your notes in a more logical or coherent fashion. You could write your permanent notes in an outline form if that seems suitable: You don't have to follow any "official" or formal outlining style (e.g., using the I.A.1.(a)(i) format or the (sometimes silly) rule that there must always be at least two subsections, never just one) — after all, these are *your* notes. Personally, I like to number main ideas (and separate them with a line), using an "indented bullet" style for details:

```
1\.  Main idea 1
    - detail 1
    - detail 2
      - further detail 2.1
    - detail 3
      - further detail 3.1
      - further detail 3.2

```

* * *

```
2\.  Main idea 2

```

* * *

```
3\.  Main idea 3

```

* * *

etc.
