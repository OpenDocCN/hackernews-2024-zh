- en: Mornington Crescent is a complex strategy game (level H8) named after a London
    Underground station on the Charing Cross branch of the Northern Line, between
    Euston and Camden Town in Travelcard Zone 2\. Mornington Crescent station is situated
    at the southern end of Camden High Street, where it meets Hampstead Road and Eversholt
    Street.

    cast of I’m Sorry I Haven’t a Clue and a memorial plaque to the late Willie Rushton
    was installed at the station in 2002.

- en: The dual-branch nature of the Northern Line means that, on the Charing Cross
    branch, Mornington Crescent is between Camden Town and Euston, while the City
    branch (which also runs from Camden Town to Euston) runs via tunnels which take
    an entirely different route to the Charing Cross branch and which therefore do
    not pass through Mornington Crescent. This unique feature opens up almost endless
    variations of play in the long game. Grand Master players also take full advantage
    of the area’s transport links, namely the bus routes 24, 27, 29, 46, 88, 134,
    168, 214, 253, 274, C2 and Night routes N5 N20, N28, N29, N253 and not of course
    forgetting N279.
