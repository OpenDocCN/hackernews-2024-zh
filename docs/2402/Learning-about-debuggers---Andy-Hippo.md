# Learning about debuggers

January 8, 2024

Today‚Äôs article is a collection of materials to learn more about debuggers: how they work, which technologies are under the hood, what kind of problems exist in this area. There is of course a big overlap with related components like compilers and linkers, so get ready to learn lots of new things üòÉ.

Of course, the list is not exhaustive by any means. These are just the links I‚Äôve accumulated over the years and found useful for myself. If you‚Äôd like to add anything to the list, let me know!

> Note: many of the links here are blog posts ‚Äì be sure to check out other articles in those blogs! They‚Äôre often worth reading even if not directly related to the topic.

## How debuggers work

All debuggers share the same basic principles: they need to attach to a process, parse the binary and debug information, handle breakpoints, etc. The implementations may vary significantly between the operating systems, but after you understand one of them, others will look very familiar.

*   **Writing a Linux Debugger**
    *   [https://blog.tartanllama.xyz/writing-a-linux-debugger-setup/](https://blog.tartanllama.xyz/writing-a-linux-debugger-setup/)
    *   A 10-part journey of writing a Linux debugger from scratch. You‚Äôll learn the basics of `ptrace`, how breakpoints work, how to map source code to machine code and how to unwind the stack. Highly recommend starting with this one, if you wanna learn the fundamentals.

*   **Debugging with the natives**
*   **Engineering Record And Replay For Deployability** (aka ‚Äúhow does `rr` work?‚Äù)
*   **Implementation of Live Reverse Debugging in LLDB**
    *   [https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.12819](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.12819)
    *   Great detailed paper about the implementation of the reverse debugging in LLDB. Gives a good overview of various options and their trade-offs and explains in details the approach chosed for LLDB.

## Stack unwinding

Producing a call stack is one of the most basic debugger features, yet it‚Äôs far from trivial. In order to understand how it works, you‚Äôll need to learn about frame pointers, call frame information (CFI), DWARF expressions and many other things. Here are some article that explore this topic in great detail.

## Random debugger trivia

I already gave up with the categorization, so dumping the rest under ‚Äúrandom trivia‚Äù.
