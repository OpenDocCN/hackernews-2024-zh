    (read it below) did not disclose numbers. A person familiar with the cutbacks
    estimated the total number at 800, which is consistent with [a Deadline report](https://deadline.com/2024/01/paramount-global-layoffs-february-1235798785/)
    last month. Bakish had [confirmed](https://deadline.com/2024/01/paramount-global-layoffs-bob-bakish-memo-2024-strategy-merger-speculation-1235804611/)
    the planned cutbacks at a “Bob Live” town hall event in January. The scope and
    details of the staff reductions will come into focus over the course of the day.

    of 2023, Paramount had 24,500 full- and part-time employees in 37 countries, with
    another 5,800 project-based staffers.

    of Super Bowl LVIII. The telecast [set a record](https://deadline.com/2024/02/super-bowl-lviii-ratings-viewership-1235822973/)
    as the most-viewed one of all time, with 123.4 million viewers across CBS, Paramount+,
    Nickelodeon and Univision.

    month, I am confident this is the right decision for our future. These adjustments
    will help enable us to build on our momentum and execute our strategic vision
    for the year ahead – and I firmly believe we have much to be excited about.”

    with a number of suitors expressing interest in acquiring some or all of the company.
    Formed by the 2019 merger of CBS and Viacom and controlled by Shari Redstone’s
    National Amusements, Paramount has drawn interest from Byron Allen and David Ellison’s
    Skydance Media, along with private equity investors. Deadline reported Monday
    that Apollo Global Management [has stepped back](https://deadline.com/2024/02/paramount-global-national-amusements-apollo-1235822978/)
    after initially considering making an offer for National Amusements and its controlling
    stake in Par’s voting shares.
