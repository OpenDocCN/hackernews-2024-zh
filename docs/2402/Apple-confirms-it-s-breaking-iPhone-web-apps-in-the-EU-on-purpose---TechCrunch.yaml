- en: Well, it turns out it’s not a bug that broke iPhone web apps, also known as
    progressive web apps (PWAs), in the EU. Following developer complaints and press
    reports about how PWAs were no longer functional in the EU after installing the
    most recent iOS betas, Apple has updated its website to explain why. No surprise,
    the tech giant is blaming the new EU regulation, the Digital Markets Act, for
    the change, saying that the complexities involved with the DMA’s requirement to
    allow different browser engines is the root cause.

    and [Open Web Advocacy](https://open-web-advocacy.org/blog/did-apple-just-break-web-apps-in-ios17.4-beta-eu/) first
    noticed that PWAs [had been demoted](https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/08/ios-17-4-nerfs-web-apps-in-the-eu)
    to website shortcuts with the release of the second beta of iOS 17.4\. Initially,
    it was unclear if this was a beta bug — stranger things have happened — or if
    it was intended to undermine the functionality of PWAs in the EU, a market where
    Apple is now being forced to allow alternative app stores, third-party payments,
    and alternative browser engines, among other things. In the betas, PWAs, which
    typically allow web apps to function and feel more like native iOS apps, were
    no longer working. Developers noticed that these web apps would open like a bookmark
    saved to your Home Screen instead.

    pointed out at the time, that meant no “dedicated windowing, notifications, or
    long-term local storage”; [iOS16.4 also allowed PWAs to badge their icons](https://9to5mac.com/2023/02/16/iphone-web-app-new-features-ios-16-4/)
    with notifications, as native apps could. Beta users of iOS 17.4 reported that
    when they opened a web app while running the iOS beta, the system would ask them
    if they wanted to open the app in Safari or cancel. The message indicates that
    the web app will “open in your default browser from now on,” it said. Afterward,
    users said they experienced issues with data loss, as a Safari website shortcut
    doesn’t offer local storage. Notifications also no longer worked.

    Multiple staff at TechCrunch repeatedly asked Apple for comment but received no
    reply. (We had wanted to know if the company would confirm if this was a beta
    bug or an intentional change, and if the latter, what Apple’s reasoning for it
    was.) After the next beta release emerged, [The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/14/24072764/apple-progressive-web-apps-eu-ios-17-4) ran
    a report indicating that Apple *“*appears to be*“* breaking PWAs in the EU, after
    also not likely getting a formal response from the tech giant.

    its DMA-related changes in the EU](https://developer.apple.com/support/dma-and-apps-in-the-eu/)
    to address the matter. In a new update, the company explains how it’s had to make
    so many changes to the iOS to comply with the EU guidelines that continued support
    for PWAs was simply off the table.

- en: Traditionally, the iOS system provided support for Home Screen web apps by building
    directly on WebKit (Safari’s browser engine) and its security architecture, Apple
    said. That allowed web apps to align with the same security and privacy models
    as found in other native apps. But with the DMA, Apple is being forced to allow
    alternative browser engines. It argues that without the isolation and enforcement
    of the rules applied to WebKit-based web apps, malicious apps could be installed
    that could do things like read data from other web apps or “gain access to a user’s
    camera, microphone or location without a user’s consent,” Apple said.

    using alternative browser engines would require building an entirely new integration
    architecture that does not currently exist in iOS and was not practical to undertake
    given the other demands of the DMA and the very low user adoption of Home Screen
    web apps. And so, to comply with the DMA’s requirements, we had to remove the
    Home Screen web apps feature in the EU,” the website reads.

    Home Screen through bookmarks as a result of the change, confirming developers’
    concerns that PWAs were effectively being disabled in the EU.

    impact this change — that was made as part of the work to comply with the DMA
    — may have on developers of Home Screen web apps and our users,” Apple says.

    [argued](https://twitter.com/MyDaebakCafe/status/1755538810287350259) that Apple’s
    desire to hold on to its power in the iOS app ecosystem was so strong that it
    would break web app functionality for users of its devices. Apple’s defenders,
    meanwhile, will probably argue that the company’s explanation is reasonable and
    aligns with Apple’s desire to keep iOS safe for its users. The truth, as it often
    does, likely lies more in the middle.'
