    Notion. This week I sat down with Skiff’s co-founders, Andrew Milich and Jason
    Ginsberg, to talk about their early days and our companies'' shared work ethic,
    product vision, and real estate history.*'

- en: '**Andrew:** I started working on Skiff after a trip I made to Russia as a graduate
    student. I was frustrated with the limited tools I had at my disposal while I
    was traveling, but also inspired by the challenges of working with people in different
    languages and time zones, and with varying security constraints. When I started
    Skiff, Jason was the first person I reached out to. We met six or seven years
    ago while planning a Stanford hackathon. He has an incredible skill set and he’s
    the hardest-working person I''ve ever met.'

- en: '**Jason:** When I got the call from Andrew I was working on the Apple Vision
    Pro. That was a formative experience — it made me realize our digital devices
    aren''t just machines anymore; they are, in a deep and meaningful way, an extension
    of who we are, how we live our lives and experience the world.'

    of the pandemic. What a time to launch. But we were always pretty clear about
    our goal: give people more control over and knowledge about the way they work.'

- en: '**Jason:** Diving into this project during those first days of remote work
    made clear how fundamentally important it is to be able to communicate clearly.
    Communication isn''t just a simple back and forth — it''s how we build products,
    come up with ideas, create great things in the world.'

    beginning. I actually tried to reach out in 2020 when you were building your Docs
    product. We never connected then, but I kept tabs on your progress. Then a few
    months ago, Ivan and I were talking, and Skiff came up again. I downloaded all
    the products y’all had built, and was really impressed by the attention to detail.
    And as I was checking out your website, I realized that you’re actually based
    in the original Notion office!'

    Capp Street in the Mission — kind of a garage-meets-studio vibe.'

    the old days we used two of them as conference rooms and Ivan kept a bed in the
    third one.'

    our mission and values are the same — we share a view of the world we want to
    build. We came back to the office after that first meeting and were like, these
    guys remind us of how we were 10 years ago.'

- en: '**Andrew:** Likewise, I started using Notion while building Skiff four years
    ago and we’ve used it ever since. Our missions are definitely aligned. Both companies
    are based around the idea that people are underserved by most of the tools we
    use, and that building a connected workspace that empowers people to do better
    work is not just possible, but essential.'

- en: '**Jason:** I think we also have a shared emphasis on quality. Notion is a product
    where when you use it, you get a sense of the people who made it. There''s a level
    of thoughtfulness that inspired us when we were working on Skiff, and we’re thrilled
    to join a company that will push us to do even better. How can you design and
    create new productivity tools that embrace today’s technology and manage the complexity
    and noise of the modern world?'
