    where the cartographers of the Empire draw up a map so detailed that it ends up
    exactly covering the territory (but where, with the decline of the Empire this
    map becomes frayed and finally ruined, a few shreds still discernible in the deserts
    - the metaphysical beauty of this ruined abstraction, bearing witness to an imperial
    pride and rotting like a carcass, returning to the substance of the soil, rather
    as an aging double ends up being confused with the real thing), this fable would
    then have come full circle for us, and now has nothing but the discrete charm
    of second-order simulacra.l

    concept. Simulation is no longer that of a territory, a referential being or a
    substance. It is the generation by models of a real without origin or reality:
    a hyperreal. The territory no longer precedes the map, nor survives it. Henceforth,
    it is the map that precedes the territory - precession of simulacra - it is the
    map that engenders the territory and if we were to revive the fable today, it
    would be the territory whose shreds are slowly rotting across the map. It is the
    real, and not the map, whose vestiges subsist here and there, in the deserts which
    are no longer those of the Empire, but our own. The desert of the real itself.'

    the Empire remains. For it is with the same imperialism that present-day simulators
    try to make the real, all the real, coincide with their simulation models. But
    it is no longer a question of either maps or territory. Something has disappeared:
    the sovereign difference between them that was the abstraction''s charm. For it
    is the difference which forms the poetry of the map and the charm of the territory,
    the magic of the concept and the charm of the real. This representational imaginary,
    which both culminates in and is engulfed by the cartographer''s mad project of
    an ideal coextensivity between the map and the territory, disappears with simulation,
    whose operation is nuclear and genetic, and no longer specular and discursive.
    With it goes all of metaphysics. No more mirror of being and appearances, of the
    real and its concept; no more imaginary coextensivity: rather, genetic miniaturization
    is the dimension of simulation. The real is produced from miniaturized units,
    from matrices, memory banks and command models - and with these it can be reproduced
    an indefinite number of times. It no longer has to be rational, since it is no
    longer measured against some ideal or negative instance. It is nothing more than
    operational. In fact, since it is no longer enveloped by an imaginary, it is no
    longer real at all. It is a hyperreal: the product of an irradiating synthesis
    of combinatory models in a hyperspace without atmosphere.'

    a question of imitation, nor of reduplication, nor even of parody. It is rather
    a question of substituting signs of the real for the real itself; that is, an
    operation to deter every real process by its operational double, a metastable,
    programmatic, perfect descriptive machine which provides all the signs of the
    real and short-circuits all its vicissitudes. Never again will the real have to
    be produced: this is the vital function of the model in a system of death, or
    rather of anticipated resurrection which no longer leaves any chance even in the
    event of death. A hyperreal henceforth sheltered from the imaginary, and from
    any distinction between the real and the imaginary, leaving room only for the
    orbital recurrence of models and the simulated generation of difference.'

    to have what one hasn''t. One implies a presence, the other an absence. But the
    matter is more complicated, since to simulate is not simply to feign: "Someone
    who feigns an illness can simply go to bed and pretend he is ill. Someone who
    simulates an illness produces in himself some of the symptoms" (Littre). Thus,
    feigning or dissimulating leaves the reality principle intact: the difference
    is always clear, it is only masked; whereas simulation threatens the difference
    between "true" and "false", between "real" and "imaginary". Since the simulator
    produces "true" symptoms, is he or she ill or not? The simulator cannot be treated
    objectively either as ill, or as not ill. Psychology and medicine stop at this
    point, before a thereafter undiscoverable truth of the illness. For if any symptom
    can be "produced," and can no longer be accepted as a fact of nature, then every
    illness may be considered as simulatable and simulated, and medicine loses its
    meaning since it only knows how to treat "true" illnesses by their objective causes.
    Psychosomatics evolves in a dubious way on the edge of the illness principle.
    As for psychoanalysis, it transfers the symptom from the organic to the unconscious
    order: once again, the latter is held to be real, more real than the former; but
    why should simulation stop at the portals of the unconscious? Why couldn''t the
    "work" of the unconscious be "produced" in the same way as any other symptom in
    classical medicine? Dreams already are.'

    floats on either side of illness, on either side of health, or with the reduplication

    suggest: that ultimately there has never been any God; that only simulacra exist;

    to believe that images only occulted or masked the Platonic idea of God, there

    the apparition of God in the mirror of images, they already enacted his death
    and his disappearance in the epiphany of his representations (which they perhaps
