    where the cartographers of the Empire draw up a map so detailed that it ends up
    exactly covering the territory (but where, with the decline of the Empire this
    map becomes frayed and finally ruined, a few shreds still discernible in the deserts
    - the metaphysical beauty of this ruined abstraction, bearing witness to an imperial
    pride and rotting like a carcass, returning to the substance of the soil, rather
    as an aging double ends up being confused with the real thing), this fable would

    a hyperreal. The territory no longer precedes the map, nor survives it. Henceforth,
    it is the map that precedes the territory - precession of simulacra - it is the
    map that engenders the territory and if we were to revive the fable today, it
    would be the territory whose shreds are slowly rotting across the map. It is the

    the Empire remains. For it is with the same imperialism that present-day simulators
    try to make the real, all the real, coincide with their simulation models. But
    it is no longer a question of either maps or territory. Something has disappeared:
    the sovereign difference between them that was the abstraction''s charm. For it
    is the difference which forms the poetry of the map and the charm of the territory,
    the magic of the concept and the charm of the real. This representational imaginary,
    which both culminates in and is engulfed by the cartographer''s mad project of
    an ideal coextensivity between the map and the territory, disappears with simulation,
    whose operation is nuclear and genetic, and no longer specular and discursive.
    With it goes all of metaphysics. No more mirror of being and appearances, of the
    real and its concept; no more imaginary coextensivity: rather, genetic miniaturization
    is the dimension of simulation. The real is produced from miniaturized units,
    from matrices, memory banks and command models - and with these it can be reproduced
    an indefinite number of times. It no longer has to be rational, since it is no
    longer measured against some ideal or negative instance. It is nothing more than
    operational. In fact, since it is no longer enveloped by an imaginary, it is no
    longer real at all. It is a hyperreal: the product of an irradiating synthesis
    of combinatory models in a hyperspace without atmosphere.'

    programmatic, perfect descriptive machine which provides all the signs of the
    real and short-circuits all its vicissitudes. Never again will the real have to
    be produced: this is the vital function of the model in a system of death, or

- en: 'To dissimulate is to feign not to have what one has. To simulate is to feign
    to have what one hasn''t. One implies a presence, the other an absence. But the
    matter is more complicated, since to simulate is not simply to feign: "Someone
    who feigns an illness can simply go to bed and pretend he is ill. Someone who
    simulates an illness produces in himself some of the symptoms" (Littre). Thus,
    feigning or dissimulating leaves the reality principle intact: the difference
    is always clear, it is only masked; whereas simulation threatens the difference
    between "true" and "false", between "real" and "imaginary". Since the simulator
    produces "true" symptoms, is he or she ill or not? The simulator cannot be treated
    objectively either as ill, or as not ill. Psychology and medicine stop at this
    point, before a thereafter undiscoverable truth of the illness. For if any symptom
    can be "produced," and can no longer be accepted as a fact of nature, then every
    illness may be considered as simulatable and simulated, and medicine loses its
    meaning since it only knows how to treat "true" illnesses by their objective causes.
    Psychosomatics evolves in a dubious way on the edge of the illness principle.
    As for psychoanalysis, it transfers the symptom from the organic to the unconscious
    order: once again, the latter is held to be real, more real than the former; but
    why should simulation stop at the portals of the unconscious? Why couldn''t the
    "work" of the unconscious be "produced" in the same way as any other symptom in
    classical medicine? Dreams already are.'

    and to escape the specter raised by simulation: namely that truth, reference and
    objective caues have ceased to exist. What can medicine do with something which
    floats on either side of illness, on either side of health, or with the reduplication
    of illness in a discourse that is no longer true or false? What can psychoanalysis

    to believe that images only occulted or masked the Platonic idea of God, there
    would have been no reason to destroy them. One can live with the idea of a distorted
    truth. But their metaphysical despair came from the idea that the images concealed
    nothing at all, and that in fact they were not images, such as the original model

    当神在偶像中被呈现时，当他在模仿体中被倍增后呈现出来时？ 那他还是至高的权力吗？ 是祂仅仅显示在图像中作为可见的神学？ 还是说祂在模拟中升华，有效性被替换成纯净而可理解的上帝的想法？
    正是这一点，正是对立教徒所害怕的那一点，他们千年之争今天依旧存在。3 他们毁灭图像的狂怒正是因为他们感觉到模拟的无所不能，感觉到它们将上帝从人们的意识中抹去的功能，以及它们所暗示的压倒性的毁灭性真理：归根到底，从未有过上帝；只有模拟存在；实际上，上帝本身只是自己的偶像。

  zh: 一旦青少年得到解放，并一旦建立了解放权利的原则，孩子和青少年的真正解放似乎就像是他们的父母得到了真正的解放。年轻人（学生、高中生、青少年）似乎也感知到这一点，因此在他们总是更加坚持的要求中（虽然还是矛盾的）寻求父母或老师的存在和建议。最后，自己独处、自由并负责，他们突然感觉到其他人可能把他们真正的自由掠夺走了。因此，没有“让他们自己”。他们会纠缠他们，不是因为有情感或物质上的自发要求，而是出于事先筹划和修正的一种隐性伊底普斯知识。通过讽刺和拒绝歪曲的超度依赖（比以前更加严重），模仿了利比多原始机制。没有内容、没有指代、不合理的要求，但因此而更加严厉—没有可能回答的赤裸的要求。在解放行为中消除了知识（教学）或情感关系的内容，家长或教师的参照物，只剩下了和制度空洞形式关联的需求—恶性需求，正因为如此它才更加顽固。这种“可转让”欲望（即与非指向性），这种由缺乏、空缺的位置所滋养的欲望，“解放”了的欲望被自身的绝顶形象所抓住，本身无所放—纯粹的形式，超现实的。缺乏象征实质，它翻滚回到自身，从自我反射和自我失望中汲取能量。这绝对是今天的“要求”，而显而易见的是，与“经典”客观或可转让关系不同的是这种关系是无解的和无休止的。

- en: 'Francois Richard: "Students asked to be seduced either bodily or verbally.
    But also they are aware of this and they play the game, ironically. ''Give us
    your knowledge, your presence, you have the word, speak, you are there for that.''
    Contestation certainly, but not only: the more authority is contested, vilified,
    the greater the need for authority as such. They play at Oedipus also, to deny
    it all the more vehemently. The ''teach'', he''s Daddy, they say; it''s fun, you
    play at incest, malaise, the untouchable, at being a tease - in order to de-sexualize
    finally." Like one under analysis who asks for Oedipus back again, who tells the
    "oedipal" stories, who has the "analytical" dreams to satisfy the supposed request
    of the analyst, or to resist him? In the same way the student goes through his
    oedipal number, his seduction number, gets chummy, close, approaches, dominates-
    but this isn''t desire, it''s simulation. Oedipal psychodrama of simulation (neither
    less real nor less dramatic for all that). Very different from the real libidinal
    stakes of knowledge and power or even of a real mourning for the absence of same
    (as could have happened after 1968 in the universities). Now we''ve reached the
    phase of desperate reproduction, and where the stakes are nil, the simulacrum
    is maximal - exacerbated and parodied simulation at one and the same time- as
    interminable as psychoanalysis and for the same reasons.'

  zh: 弗朗索瓦·理查德：“学生要求被诱惑，可以是身体上的或者言语上的。但是他们也意识到了这一点，并以具有讽刺意味的方式玩这个游戏。‘给予我们你的知识，你的存在，你有话要说，说吧，你就是为此而在这儿。’当然，这是在对权威的挑战，但不只是这样：权威被挑战、被诋毁越厉害，对权威本身的需求就越大。他们还在玩伊底普斯，更加激烈地否认这一切。‘老师’就是‘爸爸’，他们说；这很有趣，你玩的是乱伦、不舒服、不可触及、戏弄——最终是为了去性别化。”就像一个人在分析中再次要求伊底普斯故事，有“伊底普斯情节”的梦境来满足分析师所期望的要求，或者抵制分析师一样？同样地，学生将会经历自己的伊底普斯故事，由诱惑进入，亲近，接近，支配——但这并不是欲望，而是模拟。模拟的伊底普斯心理剧（这只是所以而非实际上不那么真实或不那么戏剧化）。这和真实的知识和力量的利比多利赌注，甚至真正的悼念缺失（就像1968年后在大学会发生的那样）是完全不同的。现在我们已经达到绝望复制的阶段，这些赌注是零，模拟是最大化的——通过交织的和模仿的方式；时间一样无限久，原因却相同，就像精神分析一样。

- en: 'There is a whole chapter to add to the history of transference and countertransference:
    that of their liquidation by simulation, of the impossible psychoanalysis because
    it is itself, from now on, that produces and reproduces the unconscious as its
    institutional substance. Psychoanalysis dies also of the exchange of the signs
    of the unconscious. Just as revolution dies of the exchange of the critical signs
    of political economy. This short-circuit was well known to Freud in the form of
    the gift of the analytic dream, or with the "uninformed" patients, in the form
    of the gift of their analytic knowledge. But this was still interpreted as resistance,
    as detour, and did not put fundamentally into question either the process of analysis
    or the principle of transference. It is another thing entirely when the unconscious
    itself, the discourse of the unconscious becomes unfindable - according to the
    same scenario of simulative anticipation that we have seen at work on all levels
    with the machines of the third order. The analysis then can no longer end, it
    becomes logically and historically interminable, since it stabilizes on a puppetsubstance
    of reproduction, an unconscious programmed on demand - an impossible-to-break-through
    point around which the whole analysis is rearranged. The messages of the unconscious
    have been short-circuited by the psychoanalysis "medium." This is libidinal hyperrealism.
    To the famous categories of the real, the symbolic and the imaginary, it is going
    to be necessary to add the hyperreal, which captures and obstructs the functioning
    of the three orders.'

  zh: 还有一整章要补充到移情和对移情的历史中去：就是移情和对移情被模拟所毁灭的那一章，是不可能的精神分析，因为它自身，从现在开始，已然成为生产和再生产无意识的机构实质。精神分析也死于无意识符号的交换。正如革命死于政治经济批判符号的交换。这种短路对于弗洛伊德来说早已耳熟能详，以解析梦的馈赠的形式，或者用于“不知情”的病人的解析知识的馈赠的形式。但这仍然被解释为抵抗、绕道，根本没有根本性地质疑分析过程、移情原则。当无意识自身，无意识的论述变得不可找寻时——根据同样的模拟性预期情节，我们已经在第三类机器的所有层面看到这种情节在起作用——这就完全不同了。分析就再也不能结束，它在逻辑上和历史上成为无止境，因其稳定在再生产的傀儡实质上，一个按需程序设计的无意识——一个无法突破的点，围绕着整个分析重新排列。无意识的信息已经被精神分析的“介质”所短路。这是伊比德超现实主义。在“真实界”、“象征界”和“想象界”这三个著名的范畴之外，还必须加上超现实界，它捕获和阻碍这三个秩序的运作。
