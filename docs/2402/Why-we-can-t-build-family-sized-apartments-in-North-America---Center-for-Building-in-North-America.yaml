- en: The European 4BR/2BA design (second plan) matches the American 3BR/2BA (first
    plan, in the prior series) in size and fixtures, and therefore rough cost of construction.
    That is to say, you can fit four bedrooms in Europe in the space of three bedrooms
    in America. While new four-bedroom apartments are reasonably common in Europe,
    a new American four-bedroom apartment is largely theoretical – the cost is so
    high that they are rarely found in real life. American families instead tend to
    opt for single-family houses, whether freestanding houses in the suburbs, or attached
    townhouses in more urban areas. Single-family designs, however, lack the accessibility
    of elevators and require more maintenance, and tall townhouses in particular tend
    to be less efficient (and therefore larger) due to staircases consuming more floor
    area.

- en: The above examples are stylized plans, and the economics of construction are
    a bit more complicated. Beyond the apartments, there are also hallways, staircases,
    elevators, lobbies, garages, and other elements to consider. For a double-loaded
    corridor building, the hallway outside of the unit (measured on the plans below
    the within-unit square footage) tends to add more square footage; for a point
    access block, each apartment will have to share the cost of the vertical circulation
    with fewer other units on that floor. But in general, construction cost tracks
    the square footage of the unit. And what these plans show is that size – and therefore
    cost – reductions of up to a third or more are possible with more flexible point
    access block layouts, which are generally not legal above three stories (or [two
    in Canada](https://secondegress.ca/Jurisdictions)).

- en: North American codes (mostly building codes) have much more demanding vertical
    circulation requirements – that is, stairs, elevators, and in some cases even
    trash chutes and rooms – than codes in the rest of the world. Two stairs are required
    instead of one, even at fairly low heights. The stairs are required to be enclosed
    rather than open to the hall that serves the units. The stair treads must all
    be perfectly rectangular. The elevator cabins are required to accommodate a wheelchair
    making a 180-degree turn within them, and also a fully-extended 7-ft. stretcher.
    Trash is sometimes required to be collected on each floor.

- en: In the rest of the world, many of the above requirements only kick in for high-rises
    (and sometimes, not even then). For a mid-rise building, one staircase is almost
    always enough. At lower heights, the staircase can be open to the hall. In some
    countries (like France), the staircase can have [winder treads](https://www.archdaily.com/986630/8-housing-units-in-rue-jean-bart-jean-christophe-quinton-architecte/62ec40e554c3bc55a3e71779-8-housing-units-in-rue-jean-bart-jean-christophe-quinton-architecte-image),
    saving space. The elevator is required to accommodate a wheelchair and another
    person standing behind it, but, at least in Europe, typically not a turning radius
    inside of the cabin. In the rare cases that somebody needs to be taken out of
    the building in a fully-extended stretcher, without having the head propped up
    to fit in an elevator that’s 1.4 meters (4 feet, 7 inches) deep, paramedics take
    the stairs. The result is that in the most of rest of the world, it’s more affordable
    to simply duplicate the vertical access core as the building grows (as in the
    third plan in the first set of images), rather than to extend the hallway through
    the middle and keep adding units on either side.

- en: Beyond building code issues, zoning codes strongly encourage double-loaded corridors
    in North America. Planning anywhere in the world typically dictates the envelope
    of buildings with tools like height limits, setback rules, and total floor area
    limits. In North America, the vast majority of urban residential land is reserved
    for single-family houses, while apartment buildings are limited to retail corridors,
    former industrial districts, downtowns, highway frontage, and historical city
    center multifamily neighborhoods. With proportionally less land in, say, the New
    York or Toronto areas zoned for apartments than in, for example, Dhaka or Rome,
    buildings must fill a much larger proportion of their lots to meet growing housing
    needs. As a result, new apartment buildings in North America end up at least 65
    feet thick – leading to units that are around 30 feet deep after the common corridor
    is subtracted, as illustrated in our American floor plans, which clock in at 29
    feet (and often more like 75 or 80 feet). At this depth, there is far too much
    room to fill for an apartment to stretch from one side the building to the other,
    even if the building code allowed such a thing. Instead, a double-loaded corridor
    with ample bathrooms, closets, and kitchen space is the only reasonable way to
    fill the dark middle of the building.

- en: The only way to make these spaces efficient is to drop the requirement that
    bedrooms have windows. This makes it possible to fit more bedrooms into a space
    with limited windowed wall length, but at the expense of light and air. These
    designs are legal (and increasingly popular) in many American jurisdictions, but
    are almost unheard of outside of the United States.
