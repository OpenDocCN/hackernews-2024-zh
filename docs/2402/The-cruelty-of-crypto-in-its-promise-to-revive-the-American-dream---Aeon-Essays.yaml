    Favors the Brave’. ‘History is filled with almosts,’ says the actor Matt Damon,
    gliding through a museum set like an eager docent, ‘with those who “almost” adventured,
    who “almost” achieved, but ultimately for them it proved to be too much.’ He halts
    reflectively at an effigy of Ferdinand Magellan dissolving into the waves. ‘Then,’
    he says, moving swiftly on to the other, more inspiring exhibits (a climber, a
    Wright brother, two replicants kissing in a night club, a troupe of racially diverse
    astronauts stepping proudly onto a gangway in a scene from nowhere in history),
    ‘there are others, the ones who embrace the moment and *commit*. And, in those
    moments of truth, these men and women, these mere mortals – just like you and
    me – as they peer over the edge, they calm their minds and steel their nerves
    with four simple words that have been whispered by the intrepid since the time
    of the Romans: “Fortune favors the brave.”’'

    less than a year after its release. And had you bought $1,000 worth of bitcoin
    on the day the ad aired in October 2021, by the time of writing (two years later),
    you would have just $400.

    star LeBron James. An older LeBron has travelled back to 2003, to his messy high-school
    bedroom and his 18-year-old self. ‘All right, so… cordless headphones?’ says the
    young LeBron, dressed in his Fighting Irish jersey. ‘You can watch movies through
    your phone? And y’all got electric cars?’ The teenage LeBron pronounces: ‘The
    future is *crunk.*’ He’s pacing the room, palming his basketball, brimming with
    what the agency pitch might have called ‘youthful optimism’. ‘Anything else you
    want to know?’ his older self asks, looking on like a sage. Young LeBron replies:
    ‘Is the hype too much?’ He then flops down beside himself on the edge of the single
    bed. The camera pans to a newspaper cutting taped to the wall, a sports page with
    the bold headline ‘Is LeBron James Going Straight To The League?’ He’s suddenly
    serious: ‘Am I ready?’ His older self replies: ‘I can’t tell you everything but,
    if you want to make history, you got to call your own shots.’ There’s a pause.
    The camera pivots above as the two LeBrons begin to chant: ‘We going to the league!’
    It’s close to ‘We’re all gonna make it!’ – the battle cry of optimistic crypto
    investors everywhere before the FTX crash.'

    and the Extropians. An excavation of these lists, which linger as messy file dumps
    on GitHub, read like the rise and fall of a tiny Roman Empire (though the majority
    of traffic originated in the San Francisco Bay area). Back then, the internet
    was still something you connect to, slowly, with your landline. Matt Damon and
    Ben Affleck have just won an Oscar for *Good Will Hunting* (1997). LeBron is playing
    basketball at school in Ohio. Sam Bankman-Fried of FTX and Vitalik Buterin, the
    founder of Ethereum, are aged six and four, and eagerly hot-housed by parents
    in Palo Alto and Russia respectively.

    of ‘cruel optimism’, a desire that keeps us attached to something that ultimately
    harms us. Cruel optimism takes different forms, from desires for romantic love
    to upward mobility. At the centre of it all are dreams of something we call ‘the
    good life’, the fantasies we recruit to make sense of the world, the stories we
    tell about how we and the world around us should ‘add up to something’. We seek
    comfort in tales of hard work rewarded, of bullies beaten, of winning the system.
    Why, Berlant asks, do people stay attached to these fantasies despite all evidence
    to the contrary? And ‘what happens’, as in the financial crash and, later, the
    pandemic, ‘when those fantasies start to fray?’ When, to put it in terms that
    Berlant never would, shit hits the fan?

    and felt. Today, these feelings are reflected in shows like *Beef* (2023) on Netflix,
    on subreddits like WallStreetBets, even, arguably, in the financial apathy of
    stay-at-home girlfriends on TikTok practising self-care, money witches manifesting
    financial rewards, and ‘finfluencers’ urging their followers to buy worthless
    Tupperware stock, all trying to figure out what future security might look like.
    This affect is felt in tradwives shilling financial dependence on a strong male
    provider, and in advertisements for crypto that aired during the Super Bowl, distilled
    artefacts of what the good life has become.

- en: Published in the fallout from the financial crisis, Berlant’s [book](https://www.dukeupress.edu/cruel-optimism)
    *Cruel Optimism* (2011) had a mainstream hold that’s unusual for an academic text
    because it spoke to an unnamed but felt sensibility. The condition of being disillusioned
    and precarious spoke to the working class, but also to a disenchanted middle class
    – to a university-educated precariat graduating into the recession. Post-2008,
    Berlant wrote, ‘precarity provides the dominant *structure* and *experience* of
    the present moment, cutting across class and localities’. ‘[D]escriptions of the
    affected populations veer wildly from … the historical working class; to the global
    managerial class; neo-bohemians who go to university, live off part-time or temporary
    jobs, and sometimes the dole while making art; and, well, everyone whose bodies
    and lives are saturated by capitalist forces and rhythms.’ Maybe, Berlant suggests,
    it’s more accurate to call this phenomenon a new ‘global class’ or ‘a way of life’
    or ‘an affective atmosphere’ or ‘an existential truth’, namely, that ‘there are
    no guarantees that the life one intends can or will be built’. What happens when
    the dream of the good life begins to fray, when subjects come unstuck from their
    dogged optimism? And how has this frayed optimism, this shorn fantasy of the good
    life, also played out in the perma-crisis of the pandemic and the rise of crypto?

    Steven Yeun. It opens with a road rage scene in suburban Los Angeles, with the
    petite businesswoman Amy Lau (Wong) in her Mercedes SUV tailed by a contractor,
    Danny Cho (Yeun), in his beaten-up pickup. The show is about these two main characters
    joined together in shared impotence – shared rage – but, for me, it’s Danny’s
    brother Paul who captures the beef they all have with society. Danny and Paul
    live together in a cramped apartment. Paul spends most of his time online, indoors
    – not playing videos games or watching porn but investing. Paul and Danny’s parents
    followed a traditional immigrant path, working hard to run their motel, until
    a cousin’s drug deals runs it into the ground and forces their return to Korea.

    of a desire to live forever, the hashtag for this philosophy was YOLO, as in ‘You

    and by another rapper who posted, minutes before his death in a car crash: ‘Drunk
    af going 120 drifting corners #Fuckit YOLO’. On Reddit forums like WallStreetBets,
    YOLO had a different currency. It meant going all-in on one risky, but potentially
    life-changing, bet. YOLO is the opposite of the safe or steady investment. It’s
    not concerned with diversification or risk management because these safe bets
    cost all the money you don’t have. If there is no safe or legitimate pathway to
    security, then why not try to win some in an all-in gamble. It was all or nothing.
    YOLO was the only sane response to perpetual crisis, to the end of the future.
    The good life wasn’t coming any other way. And still we held tight with diamond
    hands to the broken shards of this dream. Money was the only path to the future.

    their time wisely, for failing to grind hard enough. Post-2008, that dream was
    shot. You could work and work, but that did not mean that you would have job security
    and freedom from roommates by your mid-30s. Maybe this was what was meant by burnout
    culture. In the aftermath of the crash, middle-class people spoke of the death
    of the dream – the postwar ethos that, if you were willing to work hard enough
    and play by the rules, upper mobility and success were waiting in your future.

    Born between the mid-1980s and early 2000s, their identity is shaped by the vacuum

    dotcom era, or racked by the uncertainty of the 2008 financial crash. They’ve

    optimism of the Celtic Tiger) and felt the withdrawal of the state’s contract
    in everything from mounting student debt to inferior healthcare to the rising
    cost of living. The postwar security and investment in public goods like education
    and housing their grandparents and parents enjoyed has been replaced by volatility
