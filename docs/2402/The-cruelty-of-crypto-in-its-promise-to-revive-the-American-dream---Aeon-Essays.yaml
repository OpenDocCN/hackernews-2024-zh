    Favors the Brave’. ‘History is filled with almosts,’ says the actor Matt Damon,
    gliding through a museum set like an eager docent, ‘with those who “almost” adventured,
    who “almost” achieved, but ultimately for them it proved to be too much.’ He halts
    reflectively at an effigy of Ferdinand Magellan dissolving into the waves. ‘Then,’
    he says, moving swiftly on to the other, more inspiring exhibits (a climber, a
    Wright brother, two replicants kissing in a night club, a troupe of racially diverse
    astronauts stepping proudly onto a gangway in a scene from nowhere in history),
    ‘there are others, the ones who embrace the moment and *commit*. And, in those
    moments of truth, these men and women, these mere mortals – just like you and
    me – as they peer over the edge, they calm their minds and steel their nerves
    with four simple words that have been whispered by the intrepid since the time
    of the Romans: “Fortune favors the brave.”’'

    star LeBron James. An older LeBron has travelled back to 2003, to his messy high-school
    bedroom and his 18-year-old self. ‘All right, so… cordless headphones?’ says the
    young LeBron, dressed in his Fighting Irish jersey. ‘You can watch movies through
    your phone? And y’all got electric cars?’ The teenage LeBron pronounces: ‘The
    future is *crunk.*’ He’s pacing the room, palming his basketball, brimming with
    what the agency pitch might have called ‘youthful optimism’. ‘Anything else you
    want to know?’ his older self asks, looking on like a sage. Young LeBron replies:
    ‘Is the hype too much?’ He then flops down beside himself on the edge of the single
    bed. The camera pans to a newspaper cutting taped to the wall, a sports page with
    the bold headline ‘Is LeBron James Going Straight To The League?’ He’s suddenly
    serious: ‘Am I ready?’ His older self replies: ‘I can’t tell you everything but,
    if you want to make history, you got to call your own shots.’ There’s a pause.
    The camera pivots above as the two LeBrons begin to chant: ‘We going to the league!’
    It’s close to ‘We’re all gonna make it!’ – the battle cry of optimistic crypto
    investors everywhere before the FTX crash.'

    many of the technologies that underpin it appeared in the 1990s and early 2000s,
    on niche, Reddit-like mailing lists with an anarchist flavour and names like Cypherpunk
    and the Extropians. An excavation of these lists, which linger as messy file dumps
    on GitHub, read like the rise and fall of a tiny Roman Empire (though the majority
    of traffic originated in the San Francisco Bay area). Back then, the internet
    was still something you connect to, slowly, with your landline. Matt Damon and
    Ben Affleck have just won an Oscar for *Good Will Hunting* (1997). LeBron is playing
    basketball at school in Ohio. Sam Bankman-Fried of FTX and Vitalik Buterin, the

    of ‘cruel optimism’, a desire that keeps us attached to something that ultimately
    harms us. Cruel optimism takes different forms, from desires for romantic love
    to upward mobility. At the centre of it all are dreams of something we call ‘the
    good life’, the fantasies we recruit to make sense of the world, the stories we
    tell about how we and the world around us should ‘add up to something’. We seek
    comfort in tales of hard work rewarded, of bullies beaten, of winning the system.
    Why, Berlant asks, do people stay attached to these fantasies despite all evidence
    to the contrary? And ‘what happens’, as in the financial crash and, later, the
    pandemic, ‘when those fantasies start to fray?’ When, to put it in terms that

    stay-at-home girlfriends on TikTok practising self-care, money witches manifesting
    financial rewards, and ‘finfluencers’ urging their followers to buy worthless
    Tupperware stock, all trying to figure out what future security might look like.

- en: Published in the fallout from the financial crisis, Berlant’s [book](https://www.dukeupress.edu/cruel-optimism)
    *Cruel Optimism* (2011) had a mainstream hold that’s unusual for an academic text
    because it spoke to an unnamed but felt sensibility. The condition of being disillusioned
    and precarious spoke to the working class, but also to a disenchanted middle class
    – to a university-educated precariat graduating into the recession. Post-2008,
    Berlant wrote, ‘precarity provides the dominant *structure* and *experience* of
    the present moment, cutting across class and localities’. ‘[D]escriptions of the
    affected populations veer wildly from … the historical working class; to the global
    managerial class; neo-bohemians who go to university, live off part-time or temporary
    jobs, and sometimes the dole while making art; and, well, everyone whose bodies
    and lives are saturated by capitalist forces and rhythms.’ Maybe, Berlant suggests,
    it’s more accurate to call this phenomenon a new ‘global class’ or ‘a way of life’
    or ‘an affective atmosphere’ or ‘an existential truth’, namely, that ‘there are
    no guarantees that the life one intends can or will be built’. What happens when
    the dream of the good life begins to fray, when subjects come unstuck from their
    dogged optimism? And how has this frayed optimism, this shorn fantasy of the good
    life, also played out in the perma-crisis of the pandemic and the rise of crypto?

    of a desire to live forever, the hashtag for this philosophy was YOLO, as in ‘You

    and by another rapper who posted, minutes before his death in a car crash: ‘Drunk
    af going 120 drifting corners #Fuckit YOLO’. On Reddit forums like WallStreetBets,
    YOLO had a different currency. It meant going all-in on one risky, but potentially
    life-changing, bet. YOLO is the opposite of the safe or steady investment. It’s
    not concerned with diversification or risk management because these safe bets
    cost all the money you don’t have. If there is no safe or legitimate pathway to
    security, then why not try to win some in an all-in gamble. It was all or nothing.
    YOLO was the only sane response to perpetual crisis, to the end of the future.
    The good life wasn’t coming any other way. And still we held tight with diamond
    hands to the broken shards of this dream. Money was the only path to the future.
    It still meant, as the journalist Annie Minoff put it in the podcast The Journal,

  zh: '与Extropians相比，对于他们来说，数字黄金似乎是他们想要长生不老的一部分，这种哲学的标签是YOLO，即“You only live once”（你只活一次）。这个短语由加拿大说唱歌手Drake在2011年推广，另一位说唱歌手在车祸死前几分钟发帖：“喝醉了，120迈漂移弯道
    #Fuckit YOLO”。在Reddit的论坛如WallStreetBets上，YOLO有不同的含义。它意味着押注一次冒险，可能会改变生活，但也有风险。YOLO与安全或稳健的投资相反。它不关心分散化或风险管理，因为这些安全的赌注花光了你没有的所有钱。如果没有安全或合法的通向安全的途径，那么为什么不试试全力以赴赌一把呢？要么全赢，要么全输。YOLO是对永恒危机的唯一理智回应，对未来的终结。美好生活不会以其他方式到来。我们依然紧握这个梦想的残片，像钻石一样坚定。钱是通向未来的唯一途径。如记者Annie
    Minoff在播客《The Journal》中所说，它依然意味着“重塑世界的能力，这样，一次，它实际上是为你建造的。”'
- en: 'The investors on Reddit channels like WallStreetBets share stocks, risky trades
    and loss porn, but they also talk a lot about houses. There are countless members
    ‘waiting around for the housing market to go up in the smoke so they can finally
    buy some real estate’. Or waiting for those dreamy 10x trades that would lead
    like a dream to a down payment. Boom. One member called coffeebeerwhiskey posts
    about an amazing trade that allowed him to finally put a down payment on a house.
    ‘Must have been one cheap ass house,’ someone writes. ‘Where is this house anyway,
    Mars?’ Someone else called waitthere-shut-up posts that he’s down $7,000 on GameStop
    stock (GME) but he’s holding. He’s going to the Moon. He wants a down payment
    so that he doesn’t have to beg his wife’s father for a handout: ‘I don’t want
    to be licking his nuts for the next 30 year[s]. GME will be freedom from being
    under my father-in-law’s thumb. That is worth more to me than anything!’ ‘This
    is for my children!’ someone posts below a screengrab of a crazy bet, only half
    ironically.'

  zh: Reddit频道如WallStreetBets上的投资者分享股票、冒险交易和损失记录，但他们也经常谈论房屋。有无数成员“等待着房地产市场砰地一声崩溃，这样他们终于可以买些房地产”。或者等待那些梦幻般的10倍交易，这将如梦一般地带来首付款。嘭。一位名为coffeebeerwhiskey的成员发布了一笔惊人的交易，使他最终能支付房子的首付款。“房子一定便宜得很，”有人写道。“这个房子到底在哪里，火星吗？”另一位名为waitthere-shut-up的成员发帖说，他在GameStop股票（GME）上亏了7000美元，但他还在持有。他要去月球。他想要一笔首付款，这样他就不必向妻子的父亲乞讨：“我不想在未来30年里舔他的蛋蛋。GME将解放我，不再受制于岳父之下。对我来说，这比任何事情都重要！”“这是为了我的孩子！”有人在一个疯狂赌注的截图下面半开玩笑地发帖。
- en: When I search ‘down payment’ and sit back to read the results, half of the posts
    are written by people trying to win enough to buy a house, and half are from people
    who have lost all of their savings in an all-in gamble. Somebody called yolobistro
    posts to the WallStreetBets/lossporn thread. After growing their stocks to nearly
    $130,000, they’re now down to just $6,000\. ‘My life is over,’ they write. The
    helpful suggestions pour in, from working in Wendy’s to suicide. ‘It’s just money
    bro,’ someone chips in, a little incongruously for the thread. It’s not ‘just’
    money, puts in Edwardpaperhands. ‘Money buys food, shelter, and heating. It is
    a crystallized, physical version of thousands of hours spent working my ass off
    and getting shat on by customers and shitty managers. We literally need money
    to survive and it is not something to be trivialized either by a comment likes
    [sic] yours or by gambling it in a casino masquerading as an “investment”.’ ‘It’s
    not real,’ writes someone calling themselves Oswald_Hydrabot. ‘None of this shit
    is, come back to the trash fire wjth [sic] the rest of us while we party through
    extinction.’

  zh: 当我搜索“首付”并坐下来阅读结果时，一半的帖子是由试图赢得足够购买房子的人写的，另一半则是来自于在全力冒险中失去所有储蓄的人。有人称为 yolobistro
    在 WallStreetBets/lossporn 主题下发布帖子。他们将股票增长到近 130,000 美元后，现在只剩下 6,000 美元。“我的生活完了”，他们写道。大家纷纷提供帮助建议，从在
    Wendy's 工作到自杀。“这只是钱兄弟”，有人略微不合时宜地在主题下评论道。对于 Edwardpaperhands 来说，这不仅仅是“只是”钱。“钱可以买食物、住所和取暖。它是数千小时辛勤工作和被顾客和糟糕的经理们欺负的结晶体。我们生存需要钱，它不应该被你那样的评论或者在赌场伪装成‘投资’的行为所轻视。”“这不是真的”，一个自称为
    Oswald_Hydrabot 的人写道。“这一切都不是真的，回到我们这里的垃圾火中，和我们一起度过灭绝。”

- en: Millennials and Gen Zs were raised to be entrepreneurs of the self, to believe
    that, if they simply worked and studied hard enough, success and security were
    waiting in their futures. Failure was a personal blight for refusing to invest
    their time wisely, for failing to grind hard enough. Post-2008, that dream was
    shot. You could work and work, but that did not mean that you would have job security
    and freedom from roommates by your mid-30s. Maybe this was what was meant by burnout
    culture. In the aftermath of the crash, middle-class people spoke of the death
    of the dream – the postwar ethos that, if you were willing to work hard enough
    and play by the rules, upper mobility and success were waiting in your future.
    If their parents had believed in climbing the ladder and just rewards for their
    hard work, this path was now closed to their children.

  zh: 千禧一代和 Z 代被培养成自我创业者，相信只要他们努力工作和学习，成功和安全就在他们未来等待着。失败意味着个人的耻辱，因为他们拒绝明智地投资自己的时间，或者没有足够地努力。2008
    年后，这个梦想破灭了。你可以努力工作，但这并不意味着你到了三十多岁时会有工作保障，也不意味着你能摆脱与室友同住的困境。也许这就是所谓的疲劳文化。在经济危机过后，中产阶级谈论的是梦想的消逝——战后的伦理观，即如果你愿意努力工作，并按规则行事，晋升和成功在你未来等待着。如果他们的父母相信攀登社会阶梯和努力工作会有应得的回报，那么这条路现在对他们的子女来说已经关闭了。
- en: These generations are also a product of the speculative environment they were
    raised in. Most of the day-traders were teenagers or children in the financial
    crash, or just graduating college. Fledgling adults in the COVID-19 pandemic.
    Born between the mid-1980s and early 2000s, their identity is shaped by the vacuum
    of post-communist politics (I, personally, was sent, age five, to a fancy-dress
    party styled as the Berlin Wall) or shaped by the speculation and excess of the
    dotcom era, or racked by the uncertainty of the 2008 financial crash. They’ve
    encountered the death of the American dream (or in Ireland, where I’m from, the
    optimism of the Celtic Tiger) and felt the withdrawal of the state’s contract
    in everything from mounting student debt to inferior healthcare to the rising
    cost of living. The postwar security and investment in public goods like education
    and housing their grandparents and parents enjoyed has been replaced by volatility
    and risk. Retail trading forums like WallStreetBets and NFT Discords are spaces
    where people trade crazy investment advice, but it’s also where they articulate
    their loss of hope in those same dreams.

  zh: 这些世代也是他们成长环境的产物。大多数日间交易者在金融危机中是十几岁或孩子，或刚刚大学毕业。在COVID-19大流行期间是新成年人。出生于20世纪80年代中期到21世纪初，他们的身份被后共产主义政治的真空（我个人五岁时被送去参加柏林墙主题的化妆舞会）或者是由点com时代的投机和过度，或者是由2008年金融危机的不确定性所塑造。他们经历了美国梦的消亡（或者在我来自的爱尔兰，凯尔特虎的乐观主义）并感受到国家在从学生债务到次等医疗保健到生活成本上的所有撤退。他们祖父母和父母享受的战后安全和对教育住房等公共产品的投资已被波动性和风险所取代。像WallStreetBets和NFT
    Discords这样的零售交易论坛是人们交易疯狂投资建议的空间，但也是他们表达对这些梦想失去希望的地方。
- en: What replaced the fantasy of the good life? Dreams of prepping for life on Mars
    or in the metaverse? Of financial security through wild trades, or finding a good
    man to take care of you so you could leave the hustle behind? And who are these
    new dreams in service of? If the tale of hard work and upward mobility kept us
    yoked to our employers and our 9-to-5 jobs, the fantasy of the YOLO investment
    ‘Lambos or food stamps!’ keeps its subjects attached to the market. To risking
    it all. And these dreams feed the market, as in the crypto winter of 2021 where
    many vulnerable investors were left holding the bag, or the post-GameStop frenzy
    where, despite feelgood stories about David and Goliath, the significant profiteer
    was the market-maker behind the Robinhood trading app.

- en: Financial markets are no longer a space where investors allocate capital to
    businesses to grow a profit. It’s all about gambling on vibes in the gulf left
    by financial and social and political systems in total freefall. Nihilistic vibes,
    desperate vibes, hopeless vibes. The market is a giant lottery in search of the
    prize of security, gambling for a spot in the lifeboats. Of course, financial
    markets have been divorced from the so-called ‘real’ economy since the 1970s.
    But, maybe, in the era of post-truth and political apathy, what *is* new is an
    acceleration of these sensations, a total sense that *nothing* matters anymore.
    Hard work doesn’t matter. Good sense doesn’t matter, and neither do good bets
    or doing all the right things.

  zh: 金融市场不再是投资者为企业配置资本以实现利润增长的空间。一切都是在金融、社会和政治系统全面崩溃的空隙中赌博。虚无主义的氛围，绝望的氛围，无望的氛围。市场是一个寻找安全奖励的巨大彩票，赌博争夺生存的机会。当然，自20世纪70年代以来，金融市场就已经脱离了所谓的“真实”经济。但也许，在后真相和政治冷漠的时代，新的是这些感觉的加速，一种彻底的感觉，即再也没有什么重要的了。勤奋工作不重要。好的判断力不重要，好的押注或做正确的事情也不重要。
