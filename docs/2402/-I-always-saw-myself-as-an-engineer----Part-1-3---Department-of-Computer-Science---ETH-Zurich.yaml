- en: Niklaus Wirth was a professor at ETH Zurich from 1968 to 1999\. He was a leading
    force in establishing the department and the study programme of computer science.
    He received his diploma in electrical engineering from ETH Zurich, followed by
    a Master's degree from the Université Laval in Canada in 1960\. In 1963, he received
    his doctorate from the University of California, Berkeley, where he worked with
    Harry Huskey on the generalisation of the programming language Algol 60\. After
    assistant professorships at Stanford University and the University of Zurich,
    he returned to ETH in 1968, initially as Professor of Computer Science, where
    he taught and conducted research until 1999\. In the years 1976 to 1977 and 1984
    to 1985, study visits were made to Xerox's Palo Alto Research Center (PARC).

- en: During 31 years at ETH Zurich, Niklaus Wirth developed new programming languages
    (Euler, PL360, Algol W, Pascal, Modula, Modula 2, Oberon, LoLa), built the first
    personal computers (PCs) in Switzerland, trained a first generation of Swiss computer
    scientists and wrote several standard works that have been translated worldwide.
    He received numerous honors, including the prestigious ACM Turing Award in 1984
    as the first and so far only German-speaking computer scientist and the IEEE Computer
    Pioneer Award in 1988.

- en: Friedemann Mattern was full professor at the Department of Computer Science
    from 1999 to 2020\. He led the Distributed Systems Group and established ubiquitous
    computing as a research area at ETH Zurich. From 2010 to 2013 he was head of the
    department. At the Department of Computer Science, Mattern taught courses on distributed
    systems and algorithms, networks, ubiquitous computing, and smart energy. His
    lecture Informatik II for electrical engineers was part of the initiative "Critical
    Thinking ETH", which promotes interdisciplinary exchange, critical thinking and
    responsible action.
