    end-of-life photovoltaic panels freshly picked from commercial solar farms across
    the United States. They separate the panels from the aluminum frames and electrical
    boxes, then feed them into machines that detach their glass from the laminated
    materials that have helped generate electricity from sunlight for about a quarter
    of a century.

    extracts the valuable materials — mostly silver, copper, and crystalline silicon.
    Those components will be sold, as will the lower-value aluminum and glass, which
    may even end up in the next generation of solar panels.

    solar panels that will stream from an industry that represents the fastest-growing
    source of energy in the U.S. Today, roughly 90 percent of panels in the U.S. that
    have lost their efficiency due to age, or that are defective, end up in landfills
    because that option costs a fraction of recycling them.

    like silver and copper, would help boost the circular economy, in which waste
    and pollution are reduced by constantly reusing materials. According to a 2021
    [report](https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy21osti/74124.pdf) by the National Renewable
    Energy Laboratory (NREL), recycling PV panels could also cut the risk of landfills
    leaking toxins into the environment; increase the stability of a supply chain
    that is largely dependent on imports from Southeast Asia; lower the cost of raw
    materials to solar and other types of manufacturers; and expand market opportunities
    for U.S. recyclers.

    of solar recyclers to address a mismatch between the current buildup of renewable
    energy capacity by utilities, cities, and private companies — millions of panels
    are installed globally every year — and a shortage of facilities that can handle
    this material safely when it reaches the end of its useful life, in about 25 to

    began operations last December, said solid waste landfills typically charge $1
    to $2 to accept a solar panel, rising to around $5 if the material is deemed hazardous
    waste. By contrast, his company charges $18 per panel. Clients are willing to
    pay that rate because they may be unable to find a landfill licensed to accept
    hazardous waste and assume legal liability for it, and because they want to minimize
    the environmental impact of their old panels, said Simons, a former Sierra Club
    executive.

    benefits of panel recycling. For example, recycling aluminum uses 95 percent less

    that by the early 2030s, the global quantity of decommissioned PV panels will
    equal some 4 percent of the number of installed panels. By the 2050s, the volume
    of solar panel waste will rise to at least 5 million metric tons a year, the agency
    said. China, the world’s biggest producer of solar energy, is expected to have
    retired a cumulative total of at least 13.5 million metric tons of panels by 2050,

    regulatory challenges. Part of the problem, says NREL’s Curtis, is a lack of data
    on panel recycling rates, which hinders potential policy responses that might
    provide more incentives for solar-farm operators to recycle end-of-life panels
    rather than dump them.

    EPA-approved method used to determine whether a product or material contains hazardous
    elements that could leach into the environment — is known to be faulty. Consequently,
    some solar farm owners end up “over-managing” their panels as hazardous without
    making a formal hazardous-waste determination, Curtis said. They end up paying
    more to dispose of them in landfills permitted to handle hazardous waste or to
    recycle them.

    directive, known as [WEEE](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex%3A32012L0019).
    The directive requires all member states to comply with minimum standards, but
    the actual rate of e-waste recycling varies from nation to nation, said Marius
    Mordal Bakke, senior analyst for solar supplier research at Rystad Energy, a research
    firm headquartered in Oslo, Norway. Despite this law, the EU’s PV recycling rate
    is no better than the U.S. rate — around 10 percent — largely because of the difficulty
    of extracting valuable materials from panels, Bakke said.
