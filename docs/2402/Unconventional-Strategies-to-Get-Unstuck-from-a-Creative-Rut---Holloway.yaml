    the keys to cultivating creativity. If you’re ever experiencing blockage or a
    sense of stuckness on a decision, try opening the door to chance in order to support
    your creative work.

    authors Robert K. Merton and Elinor Barber quote the late Professor Salvador Luria
    of the University of Illinois as praising “controlled sloppiness, which states
    that it often pays to do somewhat untidy experiments, provided one is aware of
    the element of untidiness.” In any case, the idea here is to trend toward chaos,
    entropy, and randomness in your work—a sense of controlled sloppiness.

    with a dictionary or a random word generator. In literature, there is a constrained
    writing movement called Oulipo. Several of their techniques are set by constraints
    and involve chance. For example, the N+7 technique involves creating a new poem
    through taking an existing poem and replacing each noun with the seventh noun
    after it in the dictionary. In the 1920s artistic movement Dada, a common game
    to manufacture inspiration involved cutting up newspapers [and pulling words and
    sentences out of a bag](https://www.writing.upenn.edu/~afilreis/88v/tzara.html).

    set of vowels and consonants, with the goal of spelling out the highest scoring
    words. You could replicate this game by picking eight letters and write as many
    words as you can with the set as possible. If you’re feeling ambitious, you can
    even compose a poem or write a sentence with the letters.

    that Donald Glover developed his stage name, Childish Gambino, through [a Wu-Tang
    Clan name generator](https://wutangclan.net/name-generator/). (He has succeeded
    perhaps in spite of the name, [saying](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1sTWIbw_Y),
    “If I had known it was going to be something for real, I wouldn’t have used it.”
    The lesson I chose to take is there’s perfect vision only in hindsight, and you
    can make mistakes and still get to where you want to go!)

    If you want to make fewer decisions, enlist chance as an assistant. Whenever you
    need to make a decision, write out your options and let a coin toss, a dice roll,
    [a results generator](https://www.randomresult.com/), or another person’s selection
    of multiple choice, to decide what you’ll do.

    improve. If we’re not doing that, we’re led to believe we’re getting worse. If
    we regress, we are failures. These beliefs are all based on the flawed assumption
    that progress is linear.

    perfectly, we just won’t do it. Perfectionism creates an impossible standard for
    us to meet. This is just one of many reasons we start procrastinating and get
    blocked.

    Nobel Prize-winning physicist Richard Feynman recalls an art class when he was
    instructed to draw without looking at the paper. He was impressed with the results,
    noticing a “funny, semi-Picasso like strength” in his work. He knew that it would
    be impossible to draw well without looking at the paper, so he didn’t consciously
    try. He writes, “I had thought that ‘loosen up’ meant ‘make sloppy drawings,’
    but it really meant to relax and not worry about how the drawing is going to come
    out.” The solution is to do something without caring about the results.

    you want to do. You already know [your form’s most essential element](https://www.holloway.com/g/creative-doing/sections/find-the-simplest-element-of-your-craft);
    now it’s time to build something with it. If you want to write a book, then write
    at least one sentence in a notebook today, building up to a daily writing practice.
    If you want to draw, sketch out a person or an object—don’t think too hard, just
    choose something in front of you and draw. If you want to make music, hum a melody
    into the voice memo in your phone and try to create it on an instrument or in
    your computer.

    and [roll dice](/g/creative-doing/sections/roll-the-dice). Don’t make your goal
    to “finish a thing”; make it to “start with anything.” By design, the task should
    never impose on your schedule. It should be small enough that you can do it within
    a minute or two. That short time makes it difficult to do anything well, so hopefully
    you will put that possibility out of your mind and focus on the process. There
    will be a time and place to care about results—but it’s not while you do the work.

    or years later. [Musicologist Ulrich Konrad](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2006/07/24/the-storm-of-style)
    called these beginnings “departure points … a delineation of intellectual places
    to which Mozart could return as necessary.” Each field has different names to
    describe preliminary creative work. In writing, a preliminary work is called a
    “draft.” In recording arts and software, preliminary work is called a “demo” and
    often used to demonstrate the artist’s or group’s capabilities and the work’s
    possibilities. In visual art, preliminary work is called a “sketch,” and used
    to assist in making the final work.

    for improving the work we’re making. This stage is far too early to demand perfection;
    it’s best to keep [expectations low](https://www.holloway.com/g/creative-doing/sections/relax-expectations),
    to refrain from self-criticism, and to support psychological safety (the feeling
    that it’s okay to make mistakes) to allow every single detail of the idea to flow

    of a piece of work can be seen as preliminary work. While you can finish different
    versions and variations of a project, there doesn’t have to be a final sense of
    completion. Pablo Picasso said, “If it were possible … there would never be a
    ‘finished’ canvas but just different states of a single painting.” And here’s
    W. H. Auden paraphrasing a line of Paul Valéry’s: “A poem is never finished, only

    Gambino’s *3.15.20* album for nearly two years. Natche said there are multiple
    versions of the song, including one that sounds more like a party, and another
    that sounds more like a live version. He was willing to commit that time because
    the song held potential. He described his mindset: “Let’s just try as many versions
    as we can because I know this song feels like something special.”'

    perfect. Instead, it’s about creating one version of a project that will likely
    either be improved upon in the future or serve as inspiration for something else.

    is done, for now.

    Dacoury Natche. “Sometimes even if it comes out, it still can be a demo.” It’s
    fitting that Natche brings this up, since iterating on final products often takes
    place in music through remixes, samples, and covers.

    to complete work in so little time that it doesn’t feel ready. That’s the whole
    point. Your judgment of your work may not reflect how somebody else interprets
    or experiences it. It’s fine to know something that you made isn’t your best,
    and still declare this version of it complete—or to release it to the world. The
    work that resonates with the most people may not be the one that you declare to
    be the best; still, it can make an impact on people.

    of it. Think of everything you make as a demo, a sketch, or a draft. Remove all
    ideas of expectations and goals, and focus simply on the process and taking a
    draft to a state where you declare it finished and acceptable as a working version.
    With every end comes a new beginning. It’s only by finishing a preliminary version
    of your work imperfectly, that you can start a new one.
