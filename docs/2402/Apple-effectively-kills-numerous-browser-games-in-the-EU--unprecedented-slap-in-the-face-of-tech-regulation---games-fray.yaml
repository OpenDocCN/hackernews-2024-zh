    tooth and nail. A set of new App Store rules just for the EU is not going to truly
    open up the market for iOS app distribution ([February 2, 2024 **games fray**
    article](https://gamesfray.com/meta-ceo-zuckerberg-confirms-apples-rules-in-response-to-eu-dma-discourage-creation-of-alternative-ios-app-stores/)).
    Apple is also refusing to comply with respect to any variant of the App Store

    that the latest beta version of Apple’s iOS operating system treats Progressive
    Web Apps (PWAs) differently in the EU from other jurisdictions, but not in terms
    of enabling more competition: much to the contrary, Apple purposely torpedoes
    web apps in the EU (and only in the EU), with browser-based games being the primary
    though not exclusive category of victims.'

    before it declares the next version of iOS final. A beta version is not a final
    version. But **games fray**‘s analysis shows that this behavior by iOS is highly
    unlikely to be a bug, as it is clear what strategic goals Apple is pursuing for
    monetary gain and for maximum control over whatever happens on the iOS platform.
    It is also transparent how Apple would seek to defend this conduct in the event
    of an enforcement challenge.'

    doing with respect to web apps in the EU reveals a far more problematic attitude
    than its new EU-specific App Store rules (which are troubling enough). Apple adds
    insult to injury, and doesn’t even refrain from deliberately harming end users,
    which is a unique aspect of its PWA-related action and not the case for the App
    Store rules, which merely seek to cement the status quo. In the end, this means
    any tech laws or court-ordered remedies meant to force Apple to open up must be
    designed with a company in mind that won’t stop short of acting disdainfully and
    depriving its own customers of functionality. Tech policy makers will have to
    consider Most Favored Nations rules and other measures to combat that type of
    conduct.'

    than a web app. There’s even more to it than just the 30% cut. Apple just generally
    wants to have maximum control over how users discover apps (which enabled Apple
    to build its own advertising business, contrary to Steve Jobs’ vision, but also
    means Apple is in a stronger position to engage in self-preferencing). Therefore,
    Apple never wanted web apps to offer quite as good a user experience (UX) as native
    apps. The idea was that almost all of the money (the only profitable segment probably
    being adult content, which Apple deemed too inconducive to its reputation) would
    be made by native apps, but web apps might just be good enough that those who
    wanted disallowed app categories would still not switch from the iPhone to an
    Android phone.

    context, PWAs came in particular handy: they’re websites, but users can create
    icons on their iPhone start screen and launch them like native apps. There would
    be performance degradations, notifications wouldn’t work the same way, and there
    wouldn’t be a convenient payment system. But in principle, one could tap and launch
    them like apps.'

    Markets Authority (CMA) into cloud gaming and mobile browsers (with a focus on
    the browser engine issue, and the combination of issues made sense because cloud
    gaming could work in browsers if not for Apple’s anti-innovative measures). While
    the DMA’s rules related to app distribution weren’t hard and fast enough to have
    Apple profoundly worried, the simple rule that alternative browser engines had
    to be allowed seemed more enforceable (plus it’s so costly to make a browser that
    Apple would have risked litigation with someone like Google over that issue).
    So Apple decided to make a concession with respect to browser engines. And in
    the EU, with a view to setting default browsers other than Safari.

    have the power and the strength to just kick Apple out of its market the way Apple
    ejected Fortnite from the App Store in August 2020\. If it meant that countless
    Chinese citizens could basically throw away their iPhones, China could handle
    (some Chinese companies make phones now that are arguably better than Apple’s
