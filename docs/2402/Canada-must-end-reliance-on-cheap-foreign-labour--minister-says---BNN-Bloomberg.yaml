- en: Canada’s immigration minister is taking steps to curb the country’s dependence
    on temporary foreign labour and international students, prompting pushback from
    business groups that say there aren’t enough domestic workers available to sustain
    parts of the economy.

- en: Marc Miller introduced a limit on foreign student visas last month, cutting
    them by 35 per cent for this year. He will announce further changes soon to restrict
    students’ off-campus work hours and he’s also reviewing the country’s temporary
    foreign worker program, he told Bloomberg News in an interview.

    industry trying to make ends meet will look at the ability to drive down wages.
    There is an incentive to drive labour costs down. It’s something that’ll require
    a larger discussion.”

- en: The minister is wrestling with a surge of foreign students and temporary workers
    that has helped drive up housing costs, sparking a backlash against Prime Minister
    Justin Trudeau’s government. Miller’s challenge is balancing economic needs with
    preserving the country’s relatively orderly immigration system, which has seen
    a loss of public support in recent months.

- en: While the U.S. and many European countries are grappling with a surge in undocumented
    migration, Canada’s geography has allowed it to keep better control over population
    inflows. But the country is nevertheless struggling to cope with increases in
    temporary newcomers, who’ve arrived to work in farms and factories, or study at
    its colleges and universities while also working.

    over six per cent of the population, and they play a key role in filling the labour-force
    gaps left by an aging population. But rapid growth, particularly in the student
    population, has led to soaring rents and house prices, hurting Trudeau’s popularity.

    student visas, he ended a policy that allowed spouses of foreign students to gain
    work permits and introduced new restrictions on work permits available after graduation.

- en: He’s now turning his attention to a temporary measure that has allowed students
    to work as much as 40 hours a week off campus. The policy was introduced in 2022
    in response to pandemic-related labour shortages. More than 80 per cent are now
    working more than 20 hours a week, Miller said. Still, he defended the move as
    necessary at the time, and said the new rule will likely allow more than 20 hours
    of work, but less than 40.

    the temporary foreign worker program, which allows firms to bring in employees
    from abroad on time-limited visas. The minister declined to elaborate, but said
    he’s concerned about abuse in some lower-wage sectors.

    the government appears to be in “panic mode” and making sweeping changes without
    thinking through the ramifications, particularly for smaller and rural communities
    that have come to rely on migrants to work and to buy goods and services.

    hours for students, Miller said. “Some of the big-box stores, some of the businesses
    that have international students, have pushed relatively hard to preserve the
    40-hour work week,” Miller said. “Some student groups call for it as well because
    a lot of employers want you to be able to commit to more than 20 hours.”

    “一些学生团体也呼吁这样做，因为许多雇主希望你能够承诺超过20个小时。”

    of work per week when class is in session. “For international students, retail
    can provide a way to supplement their incomes, enhance language skills, and provide
    useful employment skills – everything from front-line retail and customer service,
    to logistics and supply chain,” spokeswoman Michelle Wasylyshen said in an email.

- en: Canada stands ready to shoulder the economic impact of limiting temporary migration,
    Miller said. High levels of immigration have helped keep Canada’s economy growing despite
    the sharp rise in interest rates. But the increase in migration has also contributed
    to inflation, and many foreign students are not getting the experience they were
    promised by colleges that are exploiting them for profit, Miller said.

- en: '“The question we posed to ourselves is: do we want that short-term gain for
    a lot of long-term pain?” he said, adding that some colleges have been relying
    on “fast money” that harms young people and their families. “Institutions that
    have profiled models of growth that are no longer tenable will perhaps have to
    shut down if it’s done properly.”'
