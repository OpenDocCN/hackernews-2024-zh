- en: In *Warriors and Worriers*, psychologist Joyce Benenson presents a new theory
    of sex differences, based on thirty years of research with young children and
    primates around the world. … boys and men deter their enemies, while girls and
    women find assistants to aid them in coping with vulnerable children and elders.
    … Human males form cooperative groups that compete against out-groups, while human
    females exclude other females in their quest to find mates, female family members
    to invest in their children, and keep their own hearts ticking. In the process,
    Benenson turns upside down the familiar wisdom that women are more sociable than
    men and that men are more competitive than women.

- en: How does a woman compete while minimizing the risk of retaliation? I suggest
    that women use a few simple strategies. Strategy 1 is that a woman does not ever
    let anyone else know that she is competing with them. …  She preaches the mantra
    of equality for all, and sincerely believes it. …Unaware of her own competitive
    instincts, she tries to get as much as she can for herself, while insisting that
    everyone else share equally. If strategy 1 is not working out well enough, then
    a woman may switch to strategy 2, which requires employing social exclusion. She
    must ally with other females to run their target out of town. That way, they retain
    more resources, status, allies, babysitters, and high-quality mates for themselves.
    The virtue of social exclusion is that it allows overt competition but reduces
    the risk of retalitation because the target is outnumbered. Should strategy 2
    fail, the final fallback is strategy 3, which is reserved for emergencies. It
    entails a direct hit on a competitor, a physical or verbal assault. If a woman
    must use strategy 3, she has failed. She is no longer nice; she is mean. … She
    will be abandoned by former allies. Not only that, but she risks retaliation from
    her target. …

- en: Strategy 2 comes into play when one female stands out. She may stand out because
    she obviously tries to outdo everyone else. She may stand out because she is new,
    extremely talented, or simply has the resources or relationships that others want.
    She may even stand out simply because she is an easy target and has nothing going
    for her. She has no allies. It would cost little to be rid of her, leaving more
    for everyone else. In any of these circumstances, it might be worth using a more
    direct competitive strategy. However, any form of individual, direct competition
    leaves open the possibility of retaliation and potential harm. One way of minimizing
    this is for several girls or women to gang up on a single target. This way, there
    is little chance of any one of the group suffering harm. Social exclusion accomplishes
    just that. …

    the heart of a girl or woman than the thought that she will be excluded. In one
    recent study, my students and I asked women and men simply to read about being
    socially excluded by a friend. Women’s heart rates increased much more than men’s
    heart rates did. In contrast, women’s and men’s heart rates increased equally
    when they imagined being physically assaulted by a friend. …

    childhood. It has been used by females across diverse cultures in middle childhood
    and adolescence and adulthood … An experimenter brought two 6-year-olds, either
    girls or boys, to a room … One week later, the same two children returned to the
    room and …  a third child of the same sex was brought to the room after the pair
    had been playing for a while. … pairs of girls were more likely than pairs of
    boys to exclude the newcomer. … Girls took more than three times as long as boys
    to speak to the newcomer. … In 4 of the 15 girls’ groups, the girls never spoke
    a single word to the newcomer. …

    schools reported many instances of temporary and permanent exclusion of former
    friends, new girls, vulnerable girls with few friends or little self-confidence,
    or geeky girls. … At one … school, two or three cases occurred per year in which
    the exclusion was so severe that a girl had to transfer to another school. Unfortunately,
    nothing is worse than entering a new school. These transfer girls often found
    themselves excluded again. … Several studies show that [women] dislike moving
    more than men do. …

    would produce a short play. … Every group worked hard. No adults were present.
    … The seven boys’ plays consisted primarily of skits based either on a popular
    television show or on football (soccer) matches between two well-known teams.
    … All of the boys took part equally in these plays. No one was singled out. In
    contrast, six of the seven girls’ plays involved social exclusion of a target
    girl. … girls more frequently formed a coalition whose members synchronously directed
    behavior toward one lone girl. Second, the girls varied more in the amount of
    time each girl got on stage. The girl who was excluded got a lot less air time

    be able to get together to exclude them. Even though this did not affect the participant’s
    chances of winning, women immediately switched strategies. Instead of playing
    alone, they chose to ally with one player and exclude the other one. Men were
    completely unaffected. …

    others say they don’t like. Some sort of accusation is often required, but details
    or supporting concrete evidence are less often required. I guess this change is
    part of the overall feminization of culture, though it must also have other causes. (What?)
