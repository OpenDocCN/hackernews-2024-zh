- en: It's fairly common to use git repositories as a vehicle for serving websites.
    The webdev pushes their changes to some branch of a publicly available git repository,
    and some web server somewhere serves the current tip of that branch as the website.
    Github Pages would be the most famous example of this.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The domani reverse proxy also supports serving a website from a git repository.
    It previously did so by automatically cloning the repository locally, and periodically
    pulling changes down. This worked fine enough, but I figured it could be simplified
    further such that no local state is required except the current hash of the desired
    branch. This post is going to explain how this can be done by first guiding you
    through git's internals a bit.

- en: 'The first thing to understand is what git branches actually are; they are a
    kind of "ref" (reference). Git tags are another kind of ref. A ref is nothing
    more than a name which points to an object hash, most likely a commit hash. You
    can easily inspect the refs of a git project, even without the git tool itself.
    For example, the current tip of the `main` branch can be found in the `.git/refs/heads/main`
    file:'

    single object hash. When the current tip of a branch is changed the only real
    change which takes place on the filesystem is to change the content of its ref
    file. At its core, git is actually quite a simple tool.

    object, but what does that really mean?
  prefs: []

- en: 'There are four kinds of git object: blob, tree, commit, and tag. Regardless
    of the object''s kind, it is stored in a file named after the SHA1 of the object
    within the `.git/objects` directory. Objects are always stored compressed using
    zlib, but it is their uncompressed form which is used for hashing.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This example computes the hash of the object pointed to from our previous example.
    You can see the output SHA1 is the same as the object's file name (with the first
    two characters used for a directory name, otherwise the `objects` directory would
    get too big.) Note the usage of `pigz -d`, which does the zlib decompression.

    that). The `264` denotes the size of the rest of the file after the header. Following
    the `264` would be a null byte, except that the null byte was replaced with a
    newline by the `tr '\0' '\n'`.

    with the commit's description which makes up the tail of the file. The parent
    refers to the previous commit in the chain by its object hash. The tree is perhaps
    unfamiliar, unless you've dove into git's internals before, but it is the most
    interesting bit for our purposes.

- en: Contrary to how git usually presents commits to its users, git commits do not
    actually contain a diff from the previous to the current state of the repository.
    Each commit instead contains a reference to a tree, where each tree fully describes
    the state of the repository's files at that commit. What you see when you do something
    like `git show` is actually a diff generated in real-time between the previous
    and current trees.

    a repository from just a single hash. If any file in the repository were to change
    then the hash of its associated blob object would change, which would change the
    associated entry in the tree the file falls in, which changes the hash of the
    tree's object, which changes the entry for the tree in the tree's parent directory,
    and so on. The change propagates all the way upward to the root tree object and
    its hash. This hash is then stored in a commit, which allows each commit to easily
    denote the entire state of the repository.

    Well, first it would need to query the repository server for the commit (using
    `/info/refs`), and then fetch the commit object in order to pull out the root
    tree hash, and then fetch the root tree object.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: From there the server would need to look in the root tree object and check that
    it sees a tree entry called `static`, and fetch its tree object. The server would
    then check `static`'s tree object for a blob entry called `foo.html`, and finally
    it would fetch that blob, passing its contents back as the response to the original
    request (after stripping off the git object header).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This sounds like a lot of steps to serve a single file, but there's two key
    optimizations which can be made. The first is to cache the root tree's hash in
    memory, which skips two lookups right at the beginning. The root tree's hash will
    only change when the latest commit of the branch changes, so it's enough to cache
    it in memory and have a separate background process periodically re-check the
    latest commit.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The second optimization is to cache tree objects in-memory using their hash
    as a key. The object identified by a hash never changes, so this cache is easy
    to manage, and by caching the tree objects in memory (perhaps with an LRU cache
    if memory usage is a concern) all round-trips to the remote server can be eliminated,
    save for the final round-trip for the file itself.
