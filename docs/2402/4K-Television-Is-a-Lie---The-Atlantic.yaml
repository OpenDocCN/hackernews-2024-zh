    of its top-tier Ultra HD plan by 15 percent, I had finally had enough: $22.99
    a month just felt like too much for the ability to see *Jaws* in 4K video resolution.
    A couple of weeks later, I heard that Max was [pushing up the fee](https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/2/23943859/max-4k-hbo-max-ad-free-subscribers)
    of its own 4K streaming by 25 percent. Now I wasn’t just annoyed, but confused.
    Super-high-res televisions are firmly ensconced as the next standard for home
    viewing of TV and movies. And yet, super-high-res content seems to be receding
    ever further into a specialty consumer niche. What happened?'

  zh: 去年秋天，当Netflix [提高了其顶级Ultra HD计划的价格](https://variety.com/2023/tv/news/netflix-price-increase-basic-premium-1235761124/)达15%时，我终于受够了：

    sale at Best Buy. In practice, though, the technology is rarely [used](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/blog/are-you-really-watching-4k-on-your-new-4k-tv/).
    Cable signals are generally mere HD, as are the standard plans on most streaming
    services. And the fancy new displays, as they’re placed and viewed in people’s
    homes, may never end up looking any sharper than the old ones, no matter what
    Netflix plan you have. In short, the ultra-high-definition future for TV has turned
    out to be a lie.

- en: 'A relentless narrative of progress brought us to this point, but it did not
    begin in 2012, when the first 4K televisions were brought to market at roughly
    the price of a Honda Accord. Rather it extends back into the early days of TV,
    with the idea that picture quality can and always will be improved: first with
    the introduction of color sets, then with bigger screens, then with added pixels.
    But sometimes progress ends. The peak of television-picture quality, as actually
    seen by TV viewers, was reached 15 years ago, and we’ve been coasting ever since.
    Forget the cable signals and the streaming plans. Most people just can’t sit close
    enough to today’s televisions to make full use of their picture.'

  zh: 一个关于进步的不懈叙事将我们带到了这一点，但这并不是在2012年，第一批4K电视面市时才开始的，其价格大致相当于一辆本田雅阁。事实上，这一观念可以追溯到早期的电视时代，即认为画质可以并且永远会得到改善：首先是引入彩色电视机，然后是更大的屏幕，再然后是增加像素。但有时候进步会止步不前。电视画质的顶峰，实际上是在15年前达到的，之后我们一直在稳步前进。别管有线电视信号和流媒体计划。大多数人根本无法坐得足够近来充分利用他们电视的画质。
- en: 'Years ago, sitting *too* close was the problem. If you’re old enough to remember
    watching cathode-ray-tube sets, you may have been enjoined to give them space:
    *Move back from the TV!* The reasons were many. Cold War–addled viewers had developed
    the ([somewhat justified](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2018/09/when-televisions-were-radioactive/570916/))
    fear that televisions emitted radiation, for one. And the TV—still known as the
    “boob tube” because it might turn its viewers into idiots—was considered a [dangerous
    lure](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVX1xItZAOo). Its resolution was another
    problem: If you got close enough to the tube, you could see the color image break
    down into the red, blue, and green phosphor dots that composed its picture.'

  zh: 多年前，坐得太近是个问题。如果你还记得看阴极射线管电视的时候，可能会被告诫要给电视留出空间：*离电视远点！*原因有很多。冷战时期的观众们担心电视会发出辐射，这种担忧有些合理，另外电视机——因为可能会把观众变成傻瓜——被认为是一个[危险的诱惑](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVX1xItZAOo)。分辨率也是另一个问题：如果你离电视屏幕足够近，就能看到彩色图像分解为组成图像的红、蓝、绿三基色。
- en: All of these factors helped affirm the TV’s appropriate positioning—best viewed
    at a middle distance—and thus its proper role within the home. A television was
    to be seen from across the room, and it could be used as much for ambience as
    for focused viewing. A soap opera or a news program or a cartoon might be on while
    people in the house read newspapers, balanced checkbooks, cooked meals, or vacuumed—the
    second-screen activities of the age before second screens. The media theorist
    Marshall McLuhan famously [described](https://designopendata.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/understanding-media-mcluhan.pdf)
    television as a “cool” medium, one that provides somewhat meager sensory stimulation,
    as opposed to a “hot” medium such as cinema, which intensely targets the eyes
    and ears.

  zh: 所有这些因素都帮助确定了电视的合适位置——最好是在中距离观看——从而确定了它在家庭中的适当角色。电视应该是从房间的对面看到的，并且它可以作为环境的一部分，也可以用于专注的观看。一部肥皂剧或新闻节目或卡通片可能正在播放，而家里的人们却在看报纸、记账、做饭或者吸尘——这是在第二屏幕出现之前的第二屏幕活动。传媒理论家马歇尔·麦克卢汉（Marshall
    McLuhan）曾[描述](https://designopendata.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/understanding-media-mcluhan.pdf)电视是一种“冷”媒介，提供相对较少的感官刺激，而不是像电影这样强烈地刺激眼睛和耳朵的“热”媒介。
- en: The advent of high-definition TVs, with more than quadruple the resolution of
    what came before, changed all that. By 2008, when this Great Upgrade was [fully
    under way](https://www.nielsen.com/insights/2008/in-us-hi-def-tv-penetration-tops-23/),
    the nature of the medium itself appeared to have been altered. Now you could see
    the detail in people’s faces for the first time—maybe even [too much detail](https://www.cnet.com/culture/oh-the-pain-of-hdtv-and-unfortunate-skin/).
    And higher picture resolution, when combined with another new technology—flat
    displays—allowed for the popularity of much larger televisions. In the old days,
    your 32-inch “big-screen TV” would look like garbage if you didn’t sit all the
    way across the room. Now you could get much closer and the picture on a 65-inch
    HD set would still look fine.

  zh: 高清电视的出现改变了一切，分辨率超过之前的四倍。到了2008年，当这场[大规模升级](https://www.nielsen.com/insights/2008/in-us-hi-def-tv-penetration-tops-23/)全面展开时，媒体本身的性质似乎已经发生了变化。现在，你可以第一次看到人们脸上的细节——也许甚至[细节太多了](https://www.cnet.com/culture/oh-the-pain-of-hdtv-and-unfortunate-skin/)。而且，高分辨率的图片，当与另一项新技术——平板显示器相结合时，允许更大型电视的流行。在旧时代，如果不坐在房间的对面，你的32英寸“大屏幕电视”看起来就会很差劲。现在你可以离得更近，65英寸的高清电视仍然看起来很好。
- en: Or better than fine. With the crisp picture on a screen that big, TV could be
    made to look more cinematic. Dramas of the so-called second golden age of television—*The
    Sopranos*, *The Wire*, *Mad Men*, and so forth—might not have grabbed our attention
    as effectively had they been produced in a style more befitting of the older,
    smaller, low-res sets. HD made television more arresting—more hot and less cool.

  zh: 或者说不止是好。在如此大的屏幕上，清晰的画面可以使电视看起来更加电影化。所谓的电视第二黄金时代的戏剧作品——*黑道家族*、*火线警探*、*广告狂人*等等——如果采用了更适合老式、更小、低分辨率电视的风格，可能就不会像现在这样吸引人了。高清电视使电视更加引人注目——更加热情而不是冷静。
- en: But television technology pressed on. A 4K TV has four times the resolution
    of an HD set, which suggests that screens might get even hotter, even bigger than
    they’ve ever been before. In practice, though, these newer sets haven’t really
    changed the medium at all. If anything, all of those pixels have allowed too much;
    they’ve become decoupled from the normal scale of domestic life and home design.
    According to the many TV-size-to-distance calculators available online, when you’re
    sitting on a couch a dozen feet from your television, a 65-inch screen will look
    the [same](https://www.rtings.com/tv/reviews/by-size/size-to-distance-relationship)
    whether it’s HD or 4K. The latter has more pixels, but your eyes won’t pick them
    up. You’ll never know the difference. For the picture to look much better—for
    you to “see” the benefits of modern ultra-high resolution—you’d need to upgrade
    to a preposterously large screen, more than 100 inches in diagonal.

  zh: 但是电视技术不断发展。4K电视的分辨率是高清电视的四倍，这意味着屏幕可能会变得更加热门，甚至比以往任何时候都更大。然而，在实践中，这些更新的电视并没有真正改变媒体。如果有什么变化的话，所有这些像素都允许了太多的东西；它们已经脱离了日常生活和家居设计的正常尺度。根据网上提供的许多电视大小与距离计算器，当你坐在沙发上离电视十几英尺远时，无论是高清还是4K，65英寸的屏幕看起来都是[一样的](https://www.rtings.com/tv/reviews/by-size/size-to-distance-relationship)，后者有更多的像素，但你的眼睛看不到它们。你永远也不会知道这个区别。要想画面看起来更好——要想“看到”现代超高分辨率的好处——你需要升级到一个荒谬大的屏幕，对角线超过100英寸。
- en: These days you can buy a set like that for a few thousand dollars—but where
    exactly would you put it? Our living rooms are designed for living in, not for
    viewing giant 4K screens up close. I’m sure that, as of 2024, most people still
    arrange their homes around their furniture, and then they put their television
    where it fits. Some screens end up getting mounted high up on the wall, perhaps
    above a fireplace, where they will be even farther from any viewer’s pixel-counting
    retinas.

  zh: 现在你可以花几千美元买一台这样的电视——但你到底要放在哪里呢？我们的客厅是为生活设计的，而不是为近距离观看巨大的4K屏幕而设计的。我敢肯定，到2024年，大多数人仍然会根据家具布置家居，然后把电视放在合适的位置。一些屏幕最终被安装在墙上较高的位置，也许是在壁炉上方，这样它们就会离任何观众的像素计数视网膜更远。
- en: Home-theater snobs lament these practices. They’ll tell you that a 4K set should
    be viewed from a distance of about one and a half times the screen size and at
    eye level. They’re right about optimal viewing practices, but they’re wrong about
    what other people want from television. TV’s function as a cool medium never really
    went away, even through the hotter age of peak TV. As a home activity, watching
    television now serves more or less the same purpose it did during the 1960s. The
    TV is still a family-room appliance, and it’s still one that can be used for focused
    watching, or for ambience while daily life unfolds within its glow. Even when
    you happen to be watching uncompressed 4K on a properly sized television at a
    distance from which the resolution is visible, you might still be doing other
    things, such as scrolling on your phone or talking with your partner. (These days,
    people often skip the TV altogether and watch videos up close on their smartphones,
    and yet tellingly, smartphones almost never come with 4K screens.)

  zh: 家庭影院的挑剔者对这些做法感到遗憾。他们会告诉你，一个4K电视应该以屏幕大小的一倍半的距离、眼睛水平的高度观看。他们关于最佳观看做法是正确的，但是他们对其他人从电视上想要的东西却是错误的。电视作为一种冷媒介的功能从来没有真正消失，即使在电视高峰时代的更热门的时候也是如此。作为家庭活动，现在看电视的目的或多或少与20世纪60年代一样。电视仍然是家庭活动的设备，可以用于专注地观看，也可以用于在日常生活在其光芒中展开时的氛围。即使你碰巧正在远离电视的地方观看未经压缩的4K，从那个分辨率可见的距离，你可能仍在做其他事情，比如在手机上滚动或与你的伴侣交谈。（如今，人们经常直接跳过电视，在他们的智能手机上近距离观看视频，但有趣的是，智能手机几乎从不配备4K屏幕。）
- en: The mismatch between television technology and television use seems to be only
    getting worse. The newest TVs are billed as being 8K Ultra HD—with four times
    the picture quality of your 4K set! At that hypertrophied resolution, you can’t
    sit more than a few feet from an 80-inch screen if you want to maximize its benefits.
    This betrays any sense of the human scale of viewership, or of elementary principles
    of living-room design. If 4K is a lie, then 8K is a joke.

- en: The greater truth is that TV is fine the way it is. Your HD set is already huge,
    bright, and clear enough for the bedroom or the den. No more resolution will be
    necessary. The technologies of streaming media and viewing screens may still improve
