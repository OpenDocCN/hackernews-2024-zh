    cancers are now treatable if caught early enough, this technology would dramatically
    reduce cancer deaths if rolled out widely and affordably.

- en: Some companies are already having success on a small scale offering MRIs to
    patients for a high cash price. However, there is backlash from the medical community
    as MRIs also create incidental findings (or false positives), that cost our healthcare
    system valuable time and money to investigate.

    does by at least 100x. Doing that will require innovations in the MRI hardware,
    the AI algorithms to interpret scans and reduce false positives, and the business
    models and consumer marketing to make it a viable business.  We’re interested
    in funding companies looking to tackle this multifaceted problem.

    By the time more junior healthcare workers are paid, they only make a fraction
    of what they are billing. This causes them to be overworked but underpaid, as
    much of the revenue goes to overhead and the private equity owner of the clinic.
