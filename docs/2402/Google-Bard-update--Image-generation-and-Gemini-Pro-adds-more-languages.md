# Google Bard update: Image generation and Gemini Pro adds more languages

> 来源：[https://blog.google/products/bard/google-bard-gemini-pro-image-generation/](https://blog.google/products/bard/google-bard-gemini-pro-image-generation/)

Today, we’re bringing Bard’s latest capabilities — including Gemini Pro in Bard — to more languages and places. Plus, we’re introducing image generation to help more of your ideas come to life.

## Use Gemini Pro in all supported languages and places

Last December, we brought [Gemini Pro into Bard](https://blog.google/products/bard/google-bard-try-gemini-ai/) in English, giving Bard more advanced understanding, reasoning, summarizing and coding abilities. Today Gemini Pro in Bard will be available in [over 40 languages and more than 230 countries and territories](https://support.google.com/bard/answer/13575153?hl=en), so more people can collaborate with this faster, more capable version of Bard.

The Large Model Systems Organization, a leading evaluator of language models and chatbots across languages, [recently shared](https://huggingface.co/spaces/lmsys/chatbot-arena-leaderboard) that Bard with Gemini Pro is one of the most preferred chatbots available (with or without cost), [noting](https://twitter.com/lmsysorg/status/1750921228012122526?s=20) that it has made a “stunning leap” forward. And blind evaluations with our third-party raters identified Bard with Gemini Pro as one of the top-performing conversational AIs, compared to leading free and paid alternatives.
