- en: Governments originally meant for civil asset forfeiture laws to take the profit
    out of crime and show that crime literally does not pay. Since governments keep
    the seized assets for themselves, however, these laws lead to perverse incentives.
    Instead of police using resources to fight crime that has actual victims, police
    go after drug buyers to find assets to seize to increase the police budget. This
    paper attempts to show that police are ordinary, rational people who attempt to
    maximize their welfare. Police unions lobby to block regulations that limit forfeiture
    laws; seized assets and drug arrests have gone up while drug usage has not. Instead
    of trying to reduce crime, the police become the criminals by taking honest people’s
    belongings. This paper also shows the effect of forfeiture on drug prices and
    how law enforcement has no incentive to reduce arrests for victimless crimes.
