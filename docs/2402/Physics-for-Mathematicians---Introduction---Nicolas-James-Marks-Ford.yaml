    understand quantum field theory and the standard model of particle physics. My
    first project for this blog is going to be about the physics I learned along the
    way. My training is as a mathematician, and these articles are written with an
    audience in mind that’s a lot like me when I first started trying to learn this
    stuff. In particular, this means that I’m going to be assuming familiarity with
    some mathematical machinery that isn’t always part of the standard presentation
    of these ideas.

    but because I’m trying to fill a gap that I saw when I was trying to absorb this
    material from physics books. A lot of explanations of the “mathier” parts of physics
    are, despite their mathiness, written with an audience of physicists in mind,
    and so naturally emphasize the aspects of the situation which are relevant to
    solving physical problems. If your goal is to solve physical problems — as it
    should be for most of the people who learn physics — then this is the right thing
    to do. But for the reader who understands the mathematical machinery from a more
    general context, reading these sorts of explanations can be a bit of a slog, and
    it can often be unclear which parts of the text are “just math” and which parts
    are “doing physics.” My aim is to present these ideas in a way that makes that
    distinction clear.

    as the opposite trap: using the physics merely as an excuse to justify talking
    about interesting math. I of course very much enjoy talking about interesting
    math, and I hope to do it elsewhere on this blog, but the end goal of the presentation
    in this series is to understand the physics.'
