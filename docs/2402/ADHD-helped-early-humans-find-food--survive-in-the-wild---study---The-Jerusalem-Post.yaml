    rather a condition brought about by genetic and evolutionary factors: A new study
    reveals that even early humans had ADHD, but that this condition helped them survive
    in the wild.'

    is a neurodevelopmental condition that affects approximately 4% of adults and
    11% of children. Symptoms include inattention, disorganization, forgetfulness,
    impulsivity, and hyperactivity. Without treatment, this can lead to accidents,
    addictions, relationship difficulties, and work problems.'

    specific genes and even a different [brain structure](https://www.jpost.com/science/article-739711)
    than in individuals without the disorder. In the new research, scientists sought
    to find the genetic roots of the condition, speculating that it existed in early
    humans and provided them with a survival advantage.

    primitive tribal populations in Africa. These populations exhibited an "exploratory"
    behavior that helped them hunt and find new food sources.

    in collaboration with the Indian Institutes of Technology, have now recruited
    a sample of 457 Americans who were asked to participate in a computer game where
    they were required to collect as many fruits as possible in a virtual forest within
    a given time frame. Participants could choose to stay in a site known to have
    food or explore other options. Subsequently, participants were tested for ADHD.

    gathered an average of more forest fruits than those without the disorder. Researchers
    concluded that the impulsive component of ADHD may provide a competitive advantage,
    as individuals with ADHD learn from competitors and "catch" new methods that give
    them an edge and progress in achievements.

    Manor continued. "The survival advantage that ADHD provided to our ancestors is
    still not clear, but it is known today that ADHD also involves changes in inflammatory
    and stress-related components such as cortisol-stimulating hormone, which may
    have played a role in human hunting."'
