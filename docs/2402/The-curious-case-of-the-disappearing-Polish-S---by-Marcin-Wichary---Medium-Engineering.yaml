    bug reports filed in, and having remembered once asking to change what happens
    when you press Ctrl+S, I figured it out without much trouble.

    touch type on my mom’s typewriter, owning early PCs with American keyboards, rewiring
    my muscle memory for the Left Alt first, and the Right Alt second… and in the
    same muscle memory, putting Ctrl+S early on, and then replacing it with Command+S
    as I switched to Macs.

    are now imported legally by individuals and companies alike. Today’s Windows and
    Mac machines in Poland are bought new, fully support Polish, and the operating
    systems themselves are properly localized. If you open up system preferences,
    though, you will still see the programmer’s layout there, and it’s still the most
    commonly used of the two.
