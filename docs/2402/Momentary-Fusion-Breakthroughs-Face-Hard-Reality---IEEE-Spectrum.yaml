    inched closer to reality in December 2022, when researchers at [Lawrence Livermore
    National Laboratory](https://www.llnl.gov/) (LLNL) revealed that [a fusion reaction
    had produced more energy than what was required to kick-start it](https://spectrum.ieee.org/national-ignition-facility-impractical).
    According to new research, the momentary fusion feat required exquisite choreography
    and extensive preparations, whose high degree of difficulty reveals a long road
    ahead before anyone dares hope a practicable power source could be at hand.

    Facility](https://lasers.llnl.gov/) (NIF), which uses an array of 192 high-power
    lasers to blast tiny pellets of [deuterium and tritium](https://www.energy.gov/science/doe-explainsdeuterium-tritium-fusion-reactor-fuel)
    fuel in a process known as [inertial confinement fusion](https://spectrum.ieee.org/inertial-confinement-fusion).
    This causes the fuel to implode, smashing its atoms together and generating higher
    temperatures and pressures than are found at the center of the sun. The atoms
    then fuse together, releasing huge amounts of energy.

    and for a long time the amount of energy produced by these reactions was significantly
    less than the amount of laser energy pumped into the fuel. But on 5 December 2022,
    researchers at NIF announced that they had finally achieved breakeven by generating
    1.5 times more energy than was required to start the fusion reaction.

    published yesterday in *Physical Review Letters* confirms the team’s claims and
    details the complex engineering required to make it possible. While the results
    underscore the considerable work ahead, [Annie Kritcher](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrea-annie-kritcher-7a649112/),
    a physicist at LLNL who led design of the experiment, says it still signals a
    major milestone in fusion science. “It showed there’s nothing fundamentally limiting
    us from being able to harness fusion in the laboratory,” she says.

    actually the result of painstaking incremental improvements to the facility’s
    equipment and processes. In particular, the team has spent years perfecting the
    design of the fuel pellet and the cylindrical gold container that houses it, known
    as a “[hohlraum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hohlraum)”.

    X-rays that then blast the fuel pellet, which consists of a diamond outer shell
    coated on the inside with deuterium and tritium fuel. It’s crucial that the hohlraum
    is as symmetrical as possible, says Kritcher, so it distributes X-rays evenly
    across the pellet. This ensures the fuel is compressed equally from all sides,
    allowing it to reach the temperatures and pressures required for fusion. “If you
    don’t do that, you can basically imagine your plasmas squirting out in one direction,
    and you can’t squeeze it and heat it enough,” she says.

    roughly the same amount of energy as was put in and four that significantly exceeded
    it.

    laser light can scatter off the hohlraum, reducing efficiency and potentially
    damaging laser optics. In addition, as soon as the laser starts to hit the capsule,
    it starts giving off a plume of plasma that interferes with the beam. “It’s a
    race against time,” says Kritcher. “We’re trying to get the laser pulse in there
    before this happens, because then you can’t get the laser energy to go where you
    want it to go.”**'

    out only a few shots a year, limiting the team’s ability to iterate. And predicting
    how those changes will pan out ahead of time is challenging because of our poor
    understanding of the extreme physics at play. “We’re blasting a tiny target with
    the biggest laser in the world, and a whole lot of crap is flying all over the
    place,” says Kritcher. “And we’re trying to control that to very, very precise
    levels.”**'

    modeling, the team was able to crack the problem. They worked out that using a
    slightly higher power laser coupled with a thicker diamond shell around the fuel
    pellet could overcome the destabilizing effects of imperfections on the pellet’s
    surface. Moreover, they found these modifications could also help confine the
    fusion reaction for long enough for it to become self-sustaining. The resulting
    experiment ended up producing 3.15 megajoules, considerably more than the 2.05
    MJ produced by the lasers.**'

    she adds that the significant variability in the amount of energy produced remains
    something the researchers need to address.**'

    an associate professor of physics at the [College of William & Mary](https://www.wm.edu/)
    in Virginia. The amount of energy generated is strongly linked to how self-sustaining
    the reactions are, which can be impacted by very small changes in the setup, she
    says. She compares the challenge to landing on the moon—we know how to do it,

    in the journal *Nature Physics* that they have developed an inertial confinement
    fusion system that’s one-hundredth the size of NIF’s. Their 28 kilojoule laser
    system, the team noted, can at least yield more fusion energy than what is contained
    in the central plasma—an accomplishment that’s on the road toward NIF’s success,
    but still a distance away. They’re calling what they’ve developed a “[spark plug](https://www.rochester.edu/newscenter/spark-plug-direct-drive-inertial-confinement-fusion-591822/)“

    compare energy generated against the NIF laser’s output, but that brushes over
    the fact that the lasers draw more than 100 times the power from the grid than
    any fusion reaction yields. That means either energy gains or laser efficiency
    would need to improve by two orders of magnitude to break even in any practical
    sense. The NIF’s fuel pellets are also extremely expensive, says Kritcher, each
    one pricing in at an [estimated $100,000](https://thebulletin.org/2022/12/the-energy-departments-fusion-breakthrough-its-not-really-about-generating-electricity/).
    Then, producing a reasonable amount of power would mean dramatically increasing
    the frequency of NIF’s shots—a feat barely on the horizon for a reactor that requires
    months to load up the next nanosecond-long burst.***'
