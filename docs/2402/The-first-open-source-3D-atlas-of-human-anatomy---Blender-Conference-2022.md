In less than two years, 'Z-Anatomy' gathered more than 5.000 tridimensional anatomical structures and labels with more than 3500 definitions in two fully functional open source viewers.

Available for free in 5 languages, it progressively becomes an open alternative to all the students, the Health Professional and the Researchers willing to use 3D models; promoting the collaboration in Sciences through its CC-BY-SA license.

Blender is used both as a workshop and as an Anatomy-Viewer by itself.

Here is how a Belgian medical illustrator, a Polish python coder and a Spanish developer joined their efforts to provide the first organized 3D atlas of anatomy.
