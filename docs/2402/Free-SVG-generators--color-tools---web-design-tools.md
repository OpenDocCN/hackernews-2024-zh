# Free SVG generators, color tools & web design tools

> 来源：[https://fffuel.co/](https://fffuel.co/)

🚀 On fffuel you'll find a collection of **free SVG makers** to create cool backgrounds, seamless patterns, gradients, textures, shapes and blobs. Use the generated vector patterns directly on the web or in your favorite design app.

🤹‍♂️ The SVG and graphic creation tools on fffuel allow you to easily customize the final result so that the generated graphics are unique and fit with the rest of your design seamlessly.

✨ SVG stands for [**Scalable Vector Graphics**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG) and using SVGs on the web offers many benefits. For example, SVGs can be scaled to any size without ever losing visual quality, they can be edited later-on by tweaking the underlining markup and they can often be more lightweight than images that have been saved to a raster format like PNG or JPEG.

🔧 If you need to convert the generated SVGs over to PNG, you can use the [SVG to PNG conversion tool](/rrrasterize/).

🖼️ If you want to use the SVGs as background patterns, you can use the [base64 encoder](/eeencode/) so that you can add the background images inline in your CSS.

🎨 Plus, I've also created some tools to help with converting color codes or picking great colors for your designs. For example, try out the [color picker](/cccolor/) or the [color palette generator](/pppalette/).
