    Its estimated value of 10^(−122) in Planck units is “the smallest measured parameter
    in physics,” said [Cumrun Vafa](https://www.physics.harvard.edu/people/facpages/vafa),
    a physicist at Harvard University. In 2022, while considering that almost unfathomable
    smallness with two members of his research team — [Miguel Montero](https://inspirehep.net/authors/1272182),
    now at Madrid’s Institute for Theoretical Physics, and [Irene Valenzuela](https://theory.cern/roster/valenzuela-irene),
    currently at CERN — Vafa had an insight: Such a minuscule lambda is a truly extreme
    parameter, meaning it could be considered within the framework of Vafa’s previous
    work in string theory.'

    will be repercussions for the other parameters.'

    extra dimensions must be significantly larger than the others — perhaps large
    enough for us to detect its presence and even measure it. They had arrived at
    the dark dimension.'

    cosmological history to the first microsecond after the Big Bang. At this time,
    the cosmos was dominated by radiation — photons and other particles moving close
    to the speed of light. These particles are already described by the Standard Model
    of particle physics, but in the dark dimension scenario, a family of particles
    that are not a part of the Standard Model can emerge when the familiar ones smash
    together.

    what we call ‘dark gravitons,’” said [Georges Obied](https://www.physics.ox.ac.uk/our-people/obied),

    speed of light and convey the gravitational force, similar to the massless photons
    that convey the electromagnetic force. But in this scenario, as Obied explained,
    these early collisions created a different type of graviton — something with mass.
    More than that, they produced a range of different gravitons.

    said. “And then there are infinitely many copies of dark gravitons, all of which
    are massive.” The masses of the postulated dark gravitons are, roughly speaking,
    an integer times a constant, *M*, whose value is tied to the cosmological constant.
    And there’s a whole “tower” of them with a broad range of masses and energy levels.

    of our four-dimensional world and attach a small loop to it. That loop is (at
    least schematically) the extra dimension. If two Standard Model particles collide
    and create a graviton, the graviton “can leak into that extra-dimensional circle
    and travel around it like a wave,” Vafa said. (Quantum mechanics tells us that
    every particle, including gravitons and photons, can behave like both a particle
    and a wave — a 100-year-old concept known as wave-particle duality.)

    frequencies, each corresponding to different energy levels. And those massive
    gravitons, traveling around the extra-dimensional loop, produce a significant
    gravitational influence at the point where the loop attaches to the sphere.

    were, after all, weakly interacting yet capable of mustering some gravitational
    heft. One merit of the idea, he noted, is that gravitons have been a part of physics
    for 90 years, having been first proposed as carriers of the gravitational force.
    (Gravitons, it should be noted, are hypothetical particles, and have not been
    directly detected.) To explain dark matter, “we don’t have to introduce a new
    particle,” he said.

    wavelengths, which imply low-frequency, low-energy, low-mass particles. But if
    a dark graviton leaked into one of string theory’s tiny dimensions, its wavelength
    would be exceedingly short and its mass and energy very high. Supermassive particles
    like this would be unstable and very short-lived.  They “would be long gone,”
    Dvali said, “without having the possibility of serving as dark matter in the present
    universe.”

    But the dark dimension is so much bigger — by many orders of magnitude — than
    the other extra dimensions that the strength of gravity would get diluted, making
    it appear weak in our four-dimensional world, if it were seeping appreciably into
    the roomier dark dimension. “This explains the extraordinary difference [in strength]
    between gravity and the other forces,” said Dvali, noting that this same effect
    would be seen in [other extra-dimensional scenarios](https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-ph/9803315).

    with a combined mass that is slightly less than that of their parent particle.
    The missing mass is converted to kinetic energy (in keeping with Einstein’s formula,
    *E* = *mc*²), which gives the newly created gravitons a bit of a boost — a “kick
    velocity” that’s estimated to be about one-ten-thousandth of the speed of light.

    the standard cosmological model, galaxies start with a clump of matter whose gravitational
    pull attracts more matter. But gravitons with a sufficient kick velocity can escape
    this gravitational grip. If they do, the resulting galaxy will be slightly less
    massive than the standard cosmological model predicts. Astronomers can look for
    this difference.
