    a physicist at Harvard University. In 2022, while considering that almost unfathomable
    smallness with two members of his research team — [Miguel Montero](https://inspirehep.net/authors/1272182),
    now at Madrid’s Institute for Theoretical Physics, and [Irene Valenzuela](https://theory.cern/roster/valenzuela-irene),

    when an important physical parameter takes on an extreme value. Called the distance

    that convey the electromagnetic force. But in this scenario, as Obied explained,

    —— 一些不同质量的引力子。
- en: “There is one massless graviton, which is the usual graviton we know,” Obied
    said. “And then there are infinitely many copies of dark gravitons, all of which
    are massive.” The masses of the postulated dark gravitons are, roughly speaking,
    an integer times a constant, *M*, whose value is tied to the cosmological constant.

    of our four-dimensional world and attach a small loop to it. That loop is (at
    least schematically) the extra dimension. If two Standard Model particles collide
    and create a graviton, the graviton “can leak into that extra-dimensional circle
    and travel around it like a wave,” Vafa said. (Quantum mechanics tells us that
    every particle, including gravitons and photons, can behave like both a particle
    and a wave — a 100-year-old concept known as wave-particle duality.)

- en: As gravitons leak into the dark dimension, the waves they produce can have different
    frequencies, each corresponding to different energy levels. And those massive

    were, after all, weakly interacting yet capable of mustering some gravitational
    heft. One merit of the idea, he noted, is that gravitons have been a part of physics
    for 90 years, having been first proposed as carriers of the gravitational force.
    (Gravitons, it should be noted, are hypothetical particles, and have not been
    directly detected.) To explain dark matter, “we don’t have to introduce a new
    particle,” he said.

    the standard cosmological model, galaxies start with a clump of matter whose gravitational
