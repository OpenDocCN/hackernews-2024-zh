    year or so, but I'm finally getting around to writing it. This is a post that's
    informed by [the companies I've worked at](https://hire.jvt.me) alongside [recent
    job hunts](https://www.jvt.me/posts/2022/05/02/lessons-learned-job-hunt/) and

    the job market in recent years.

- en: Note that this isn't a scathing review of any particular company or me trying
    to throw shade, just some thoughts on things I've seen. This is largely with the
    view inside Software Development and Quality Engineering, and may apply to other
    roles.

  zh: 请注意，这并不是针对任何特定公司的严厉批评，也不是我试图抛出阴影的行为，只是我看到的一些想法。这主要是从软件开发和质量工程的角度来看的，也许对其他角色也适用。

  zh: 我第一次注意到工作职称的不公平是在我在 Capital One 的头几年。
- en: I remember getting my first promotion at Capital One, which made me a Software
    Development Engineer 2 and a Senior Associate according to Capital One's internal
    levelling. This was a great achievement, and made me a "mid-level engineer" on
    the vague scale of engineering levels that I could use to compare myself with
    other folks I knew, but who didn't necessarily work at the same company as me.
  id: totrans-split-9

  zh: 我记得在 Capital One 拿到我的第一个晋升，这让我成为了软件开发工程师 2 和资深联合的称号。这是一个伟大的成就，让我在工程级别的模糊尺度上成为了一个“中级工程师”，可以用来与其他我认识的人比较，尽管他们不一定在同一家公司工作。
- en: I remember updating my LinkedIn to note that I was a Software Development Engineer
    2, and noticing that some folks who'd been promoted at a similar time were noting
    that they were a Senior Software Engineer. This was a little annoying because
    we were the same level but it looked like they were now more senior, but I tried
    to let it go, as I knew that, at least internally, we were the same level, and
    to try not to let the perceived judgement of external folks matter.

  zh: 我记得更新我的 LinkedIn 时注明自己是软件开发工程师 2，注意到一些与我同时被晋升的人在 LinkedIn 上标注自己是高级软件工程师。这让我有些恼火，因为我们是同一级别，但看起来他们现在更高级了，不过我尽量不去计较，因为我知道至少在内部，我们是同一级别的，也尽量不让外界的看法影响我。
- en: This worked for a bit, until it came to my promotion to Software Development
    Engineer 3 (Principal Associate). I was very proud of this, and it meant that
    I'd reached a level where I could realistically call myself a Senior Engineer,
    although officially on LinkedIn I was a Software Development Engineer 3.

  zh: 这一状态持续了一段时间，直到我晋升为软件开发工程师 3（主管联合）。我为此感到非常自豪，这意味着我已经达到了一个可以称为高级工程师的级别，尽管在 LinkedIn
    上我仍然是软件开发工程师 3。
- en: The problem at this time is that I'd worked hard to become a "real" Senior Engineer,
    but at this time, I was seeing a number of folks who'd been promoted to Software
    Development Engineer 2 calling themselves a "Senior Engineer" on LinkedIn, and
    as happy as I was for them, it did take a bit of the shine off my own promotion
    as it seemed like I was doing the same work as them.

  zh: 当时的问题是，我努力成为一个“真正的”高级工程师，但在这个时候，我看到很多人被晋升为软件开发工程师 2 却在 LinkedIn 上称自己是“高级工程师”。虽然我为他们感到高兴，但这也让我对自己的晋升失去了一些光彩，因为看起来我和他们在做一样的工作。
- en: This may seem petty, but it didn't really sit right as folks were indicating
    they were at a level they weren't at. And yes, if they went through a job interview
    it would be clear that they weren't a "Senior Engineer", but I still wasn't super
    happy with the way that the levels didn't seem to matter. But I wasn't unhappy
    enough to actually say something directly, just have this blog post bubbling in
    the back of my mind 😅

  zh: 这可能看起来有些小题大作，但当人们表示他们达到了一个他们实际上没有达到的级别时，我并不太满意。是的，如果他们参加了工作面试，显然他们不是“高级工程师”，但是我对职位级别似乎并不重视，这让我感到并不开心。不过我并没有因此直接发表言论，只是在我的博客中暗自琢磨这个问题
    😅

    the official title of Senior.

  zh: 现在注意到这*更加*不清楚了。以前是类似 Staff 的角色称为高级工程师，现在称为 Master，而之前是中级角色的现在正式称为高级。
- en: As someone who felt that this was mis-selling the levels and roles, I didn't
    follow this, but I can absolutely see why folks would now set their job title
    like so on LinkedIn because that's what their company says they should set it
    to.
  id: totrans-split-21

  zh: 作为一个觉得这是对职级和角色的错误宣传的人，我没有跟随这样做，但我完全理解为什么人们现在会在 LinkedIn 上设置自己的职称，因为这是他们的公司说他们应该这样做。
- en: But this goes further to the point of what does Senior Engineer even mean? Above
    I've indicated the "Standard" level but there isn't a definition across the industry
    of what different levels and expectations are, nor how many years of experience
    you need, or the sort of experiences you will have needed to be deemed Senior.
  id: totrans-split-22

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 但这更进一步指出了什么是“高级工程师”？在上文中我已经指出了“标准”级别，但在整个行业中并没有对不同级别和期望的明确定义，也没有明确说明需要多少年的经验，或者需要被认为是高级工程师所需要的经历。
- en: For instance, Monzo have a very high bar for their Senior Engineer level, and
    I've heard that may be getting an increase. Compare this to an early stage startup
    who may give everyone the title "Senior Engineer", whether they'd been a Staff/Principal
    engineer elsewhere, or not.
  id: totrans-split-23
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 例如，Monzo 对其高级工程师级别有非常高的要求，我听说可能会增加。与早期创业公司相比，后者可能会给每个人都赋予“高级工程师”的头衔，无论他们是否曾在其他地方担任过员工/首席工程师。
- en: There are companies like Amazon or Netflix who deem their Senior role to be
    someone who's got 5+ years of experience, and some companies who require even
    more years to be deemed a Senior.
  id: totrans-split-24

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 有些公司如亚马逊或 Netflix 认为他们的高级角色是指具有 5 年以上经验的人，而有些公司则需要更多年的经验才能被认定为高级。
- en: I've worked with engineers who've been hired at a higher level than I believe
    they are due to negotiating their compensating package higher, which is frustrating
    too, as you can then expect more of them, when they don't necessarily have all
    the skills.
  id: totrans-split-25
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 我曾与那些因为谈判而被高级聘用的工程师一起工作，这让人感到沮丧，因为你可以期待他们做更多事情，而他们并不一定具备所有的技能。
- en: It's also unclear whether being a Senior means you will have experienced leading
    feature delivery for a team, is "just" writing code or will also include being
    a Tech Lead, having experience improving your team and their ways of working,
    solving deeply technical problems or trying to address social problems in the
    organisation, and more.
  id: totrans-split-26
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 这也不清楚，“高级工程师”是否意味着你将有经验领导团队交付特性，仅仅是编写代码，还是包括担任技术负责人，具有改善团队及其工作方式的经验，解决深层次技术问题或试图解决组织中的社会问题等。
- en: I think it'd be ideal if there was an industry-wise acceptance of levels, so
    things like [levels.fyi](https://levels.fyi) isn't necessarily needed to determine
    how a role compares between companies, even if it's a fairly loose definition
    to make it easier to work out what junior/mid-level/senior/staff+ means.

  zh: 我认为，如果行业能够接受职级的定义，那将是理想的，这样像 [levels.fyi](https://levels.fyi) 这样的网站就不一定需要来确定一个角色在不同公司之间的比较，即使这是一个相对宽泛的定义，使得确定初级/中级/高级/员工+
    的含义更加容易。
- en: As a neurospicy person, I quite like knowing where folks sit on the org chart
    compared to me. This isn't so I can feel superior to others, but just so I can
    understand a bit of social expectations, and for instance, being able to (sometimes)
    assume a bit more of knowledge and experience. Although [I prefer to give context
    where possible](https://www.jvt.me/posts/2018/08/16/context-is-king/) it can be
    nice having a shorthand at times.

  zh: 作为一个神经辛辣的人，我很喜欢知道别人在组织图中的位置与我相比。这并不是为了让我感觉比其他人优越，而只是为了我能理解一点社会期望，例如，有时候能够（有时候）假设更多的知识和经验。虽然[我更喜欢在可能的情况下提供背景](https://www.jvt.me/posts/2018/08/16/context-is-king/)，但有时使用简略描述也很好。
- en: But on the flipside, is it even worthwhile trying to get some consensus across
    the industry? Can we even meaningfully compare what i.e. Senior means companies?
    Sometimes it can be hard enough comparing the achievements of two engineers *in
    the same org*, let alone across organisation boundaries where there are different
    guiding principles, expectations and priorities for organisations' definitions
    of what good engineering means.

  zh: 但另一方面，甚至值得在整个行业中获得一些共识吗？我们甚至可以有意义地比较即高级在不同公司意味着什么吗？有时候甚至很难比较同一组织中两名工程师的成就，更不用说在有不同指导原则、期望和组织定义好工程的优先级的组织边界之间。
