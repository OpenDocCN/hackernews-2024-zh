    Writing “in print” was redundant; and incomprehensible.

    that no one in the New York subway reads print newspapers any longer. People listen
    to podcasts, look at their smart phones, read a paper copy of a book (yes, they
    do that too), watch others around them.  A friend said she has not seen anyone
    reading a newspaper on a subway in years.

    or three times per week, I went to the nearby convenience store to buy the last
    copy of “The Wall Street Journal” (it costs five dollars). I like it not only
    for its content (which with the exception of the editorial pages where they hire
    only lunatics to write them) is excellent. I love it because the smell of the
    paper is the same as what I remember from many years ago.

    It is the Serbian equivalent of the “New York Times”. It was founded in 1904 by
    a rich liberal family. It has survived all regimes and has been and remains the “newspaper
    of record”. It has always been close to the government, whatever that government
    was: royalist, communist, nationalist, but never just a mere mouthpiece. It has
    a unique font, designed at its foundation and not changed since.'

    banned Communist Party. When the said party came to power, the newspaper became
    a daily and went very official. Very few people read it, but it was always displayed
    in government offices.

    red upper cases.

    newspaper of the thinking ruling class. Not a primitive ruling class, not even
    the conservative ruling class. But the liberal, bien-pensant ruling class. I thought
    it could never go wrong. When I would see a mistake or a typo, I believed I was
    wrong. “Le Monde” could not be wrong. But it was—at times.'

    by its correspondent Jacques Amalric; as my views of China were influenced by
    an extraordinarily gifted “Politika” journalist of the 1970s, Dragoslav Rančić.
    The fact that I can still easily remember their names half-a-century later, while
    I have forgotten many others, says something about the nearly religious attention
    with which I read them.

    and print used: newspapers always smudged your hands, and you had to wash them
    practically every time after you read the paper. I thought that it was some cool
    British custom, poorly understood by the barbarians. But rather quickly I changed
    my opinion. It must have been related to the cost of printing. Yet I do not know
    exactly why only in England have I experienced this.'

- en: 'My first ever evening in America was at a New York airport hotel where I grabbed
    a copy of a New York tabloid, without knowing anything about the newspapers in
    the New World. I still remember the title displayed across the whole front page:
    “Top Cop Fired”. I could not believe that a newspaper could print such a disrespectful
    title. In the newspapers I knew, this kind of news would be buried on page 4 (that
    is, on an even-numbered page to which people always pay less attention) under
    the title “The head of the New York police department released from his duties”.
    The directness and irreverence of New York tabloids impressed me then and still
    impresses me now. They do not mind publishing “Trump is a Bump” or ”Hillary, the
    Deplorable”. When the domestic political scene heats up, they take no prisoners:
    they are in-your face, brutal. I buy them, from time to time, when I take Amtrak,
    just to enjoy their freedom from convention. It is not the “All the news fit to
    print”. Often, it is the news not fit to print, but precisely for that reason
    more important to print.'

- en: 'Anwar Shaikh, the most left-wing economist in the world, introduced me to “The
    Wall Street Journal”.  I met him in his office as he was writing the monumental
    “Capitalism: Competition, Conflict, Crises”. He told that he reads the WSJ because
    it tells the truth about what is happening in the economy. It struck me then by
    the seeming oddity of the most left-wing economist in the world praising the most
    right-wing daily in the world. But Anwar was right. An economics daily has, in
    the part that deals with the real life, to be as objective as possible because
    if it spreads fairy tales people who believe them will lose money. Then no capitalist
    will buy it. For they do not like to lose money. In the trade-off between the
    fairy tales and cash, they chose the latter. Other dailies that appeal to the
    “pensée unique” do not need to worry about that kind of elemental truth. They
    can make things up.'

    Daily” in New York and Washington for 25 cents but the booths that sell the paper
    have largely closed now. I think it is because the Chinese government sees it
    as a waste of money (it is true that at times the dailies were not “renewed”;
    so on a Thursday morning the most recent issue would be the one from Monday).
    Several years ago in Moscow I challenged my Russian friend to find a single newspaper
    kiosk in a thirteen-million-people city. He could not. But luckily in the hotel
    where I was staying they were distributing the “Kommersant” an excellent Russian
    version of “The Financial Times”.

    and where one can still, every day, find all the print newspapers and magazines,
    is Spain. I like to hang around the kiosks, deciding which newspaper’s font, color,
    and smell I like the most. Then I grab the paper, open it, smell its print, and
    think nothing has changed in fifty years.
