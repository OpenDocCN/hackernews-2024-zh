  zh: 我小的时候，贝尔格莱德有两家日报。其中一家叫“Politika”（政治），相当于塞尔维亚版的“纽约时报”。它由一个富有的自由家族于1904年创立。它经历了所有政权，一直被视为“正式记录的报纸”。它始终与政府保持亲密关系，无论政府是皇室主义者、共产主义者还是民族主义者，但从未仅仅是政府的喉舌。它有一种独特的字体，创立时设计的，至今未曾改变。

    that no one in the New York subway reads print newspapers any longer. People listen
    to podcasts, look at their smart phones, read a paper copy of a book (yes, they
    do that too), watch others around them.  A friend said she has not seen anyone
    reading a newspaper on a subway in years.

  zh: 但现在情况不同了。今天，我们（老年人中）聊天时观察到，在纽约地铁里再也看不到有人读纸质报纸了。人们听播客，看智能手机，或者看纸质书的副本（是的，他们也这样做），观察周围的人。一位朋友说她多年来在地铁上从未见过有人读报纸。
- en: Neither have I. But I love the print newspapers, and this evening, as I do two
    or three times per week, I went to the nearby convenience store to buy the last
    copy of “The Wall Street Journal” (it costs five dollars). I like it not only
    for its content (which with the exception of the editorial pages where they hire
    only lunatics to write them) is excellent. I love it because the smell of the
    paper is the same as what I remember from many years ago.

  zh: 我也是如此。但我喜欢印刷版报纸，今晚，像我每周两三次一样，我去附近的便利店买了最后一份《华尔街日报》（价格为五美元）。我不仅喜欢它的内容（除了他们只聘请疯子来撰写社论版外），我还喜欢它因为纸张的味道与我多年前记忆中的一样。
- en: 'When I was a kid, there were two dailies in Belgrade. One is/was called “Politika”.
    It is the Serbian equivalent of the “New York Times”. It was founded in 1904 by
    a rich liberal family. It has survived all regimes and has been and remains the “newspaper
    of record”. It has always been close to the government, whatever that government
    was: royalist, communist, nationalist, but never just a mere mouthpiece. It has
    a unique font, designed at its foundation and not changed since.'

    banned Communist Party. When the said party came to power, the newspaper became
    a daily and went very official. Very few people read it, but it was always displayed

    newspaper of the thinking ruling class. Not a primitive ruling class, not even
    the conservative ruling class. But the liberal, bien-pensant ruling class. I thought
    it could never go wrong. When I would see a mistake or a typo, I believed I was

  zh: 在比利时读高中时，我喜欢《世界报》。它也是一样：思想统治阶层的报纸。不是原始的统治阶层，甚至不是保守的统治阶层。而是自由、善良的思想统治阶层。我认为它永远不会错。当我看到错误或排版错误时，我认为我错了。“世界报”不可能错。但它有时确实错了。
- en: It was nevertheless a great newspaper. My views of the Soviet Union were influenced
    by its correspondent Jacques Amalric; as my views of China were influenced by
    an extraordinarily gifted “Politika” journalist of the 1970s, Dragoslav Rančić.
    The fact that I can still easily remember their names half-a-century later, while
    I have forgotten many others, says something about the nearly religious attention
    with which I read them.

  zh: 但它仍然是一份伟大的报纸。我对苏联的看法受到其记者雅克·阿马尔里克的影响；而对中国的看法则受到20世纪70年代非常有天赋的“Politika”记者德拉戈斯拉夫·兰奇奇的影响。半个世纪后，我仍然能轻易记住他们的名字，而我已经忘记了许多其他人，这说明了我当时对它们几乎宗教般的关注。
- en: 'When I came to England, I was struck by the type of paper (like: real paper)
    and print used: newspapers always smudged your hands, and you had to wash them
    practically every time after you read the paper. I thought that it was some cool
    British custom, poorly understood by the barbarians. But rather quickly I changed
    my opinion. It must have been related to the cost of printing. Yet I do not know
    exactly why only in England have I experienced this.'

  zh: 我来到英国时，被报纸的类型（比如真正的纸）和印刷品质所震撼：报纸总是会弄脏你的手，每次读完后你几乎都要洗手。我曾以为这是某种酷炫的英国习俗，被野蛮人误解了。但我很快改变了看法。这一定与印刷成本有关。不过我不明白为什么只有在英国才会遇到这种情况。
- en: 'My first ever evening in America was at a New York airport hotel where I grabbed
    a copy of a New York tabloid, without knowing anything about the newspapers in
    the New World. I still remember the title displayed across the whole front page:
    “Top Cop Fired”. I could not believe that a newspaper could print such a disrespectful
    title. In the newspapers I knew, this kind of news would be buried on page 4 (that
    is, on an even-numbered page to which people always pay less attention) under
    the title “The head of the New York police department released from his duties”.
    The directness and irreverence of New York tabloids impressed me then and still
    impresses me now. They do not mind publishing “Trump is a Bump” or ”Hillary, the
    Deplorable”. When the domestic political scene heats up, they take no prisoners:
    they are in-your face, brutal. I buy them, from time to time, when I take Amtrak,
    just to enjoy their freedom from convention. It is not the “All the news fit to
    print”. Often, it is the news not fit to print, but precisely for that reason
    more important to print.'

  zh: 在美国的第一个晚上，我住在纽约机场的一个酒店，随手拿了一份纽约小报，当时对这个新大陆的报纸一无所知。我依然记得整张头版的标题：“警察局长被解雇”。我简直不敢相信报纸会刊登如此不尊重的标题。在我所熟悉的报纸上，这类新闻通常会埋在第四页（即偶数页，人们往往不怎么关注）上，标题是“纽约警察局长被免职”。纽约小报的直接和不敬的风格当时给我留下了深刻的印象，至今依然如此。它们毫不畏惧地刊登“特朗普是个灾难”或“希拉里，可悲”的标题。当国内政治局势升温时，它们毫不手软：直截了当，残酷无情。我偶尔乘坐美铁时会购买一份，只是为了享受它们摆脱常规的自由。这并非“所有适合刊登的新闻”。往往是那些不适合刊登的新闻，但正因为如此，更值得刊登。
- en: 'Anwar Shaikh, the most left-wing economist in the world, introduced me to “The
    Wall Street Journal”.  I met him in his office as he was writing the monumental
    “Capitalism: Competition, Conflict, Crises”. He told that he reads the WSJ because
    it tells the truth about what is happening in the economy. It struck me then by
    the seeming oddity of the most left-wing economist in the world praising the most
    right-wing daily in the world. But Anwar was right. An economics daily has, in
    the part that deals with the real life, to be as objective as possible because
    if it spreads fairy tales people who believe them will lose money. Then no capitalist
    will buy it. For they do not like to lose money. In the trade-off between the
    fairy tales and cash, they chose the latter. Other dailies that appeal to the
    “pensée unique” do not need to worry about that kind of elemental truth. They
    can make things up.'

  zh: 安瓦尔·谢赫，世界上最左翼的经济学家，向我介绍了《华尔街日报》。我在他的办公室见到他时，他正在撰写里程碑式的著作《资本主义：竞争、冲突、危机》。他告诉我他读《华尔街日报》是因为它能真实地反映经济中发生的事情。当时我对世界上最左翼的经济学家赞扬世界上最右翼的日报感到很奇怪。但安瓦尔是对的。经济日报在处理实际生活部分时必须尽可能客观，因为如果它传播童话故事，相信这些故事的人会亏钱。那么没有资本家会买它。在童话和现金之间的权衡中，他们选择了后者。其他宣扬“唯一思想”的日报则不需要担心这种基本的真理。它们可以随意捏造事实。
- en: I am one of the last Mohicans who reads the print news. I used to buy “China
    Daily” in New York and Washington for 25 cents but the booths that sell the paper
    have largely closed now. I think it is because the Chinese government sees it
    as a waste of money (it is true that at times the dailies were not “renewed”;
    so on a Thursday morning the most recent issue would be the one from Monday).
    Several years ago in Moscow I challenged my Russian friend to find a single newspaper
    kiosk in a thirteen-million-people city. He could not. But luckily in the hotel

    version of “The Financial Times”.

  zh: 我是最后一批阅读纸质新闻的人之一。我过去会在纽约和华盛顿为《中国日报》支付25美分，但是销售报纸的摊位现在已经大量关闭了。我认为这是因为在某些时候，报纸没有得到更新（有时真正的更新日期是从周一到周四）。几年前在莫斯科，我向我的俄罗斯朋友发起了寻找这个拥有1300万人口城市里唯一一家报纸摊位的挑战。他没有找到。但幸运的是，在我入住的酒店里，他们正在分发“
    Kommersant”，这是“金融时报”的优秀俄语版本。

    and where one can still, every day, find all the print newspapers and magazines,

    and smell I like the most. Then I grab the paper, open it, smell its print, and
    think nothing has changed in fifty years.
