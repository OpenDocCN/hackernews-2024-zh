- en: Dariusz had all the signs of experiencing a heart attack, but apparently that
    was not the medical reason. His wife told me his heart was broken. That’s why
    this was such an important case for us. Dariusz worked so hard. His job used to
    be done by a few people during a shift, but then they made him do all that work
    alone, pushing around trolleys with heavy boxes.

  zh: 达里乌斯表现出了心脏病发作的所有迹象，但显然这并不是医学上的原因。他的妻子告诉我，他的心碎了。这就是为什么这对我们来说如此重要的案件。达里乌斯工作得如此辛苦。他的工作原本需要几个人在一个班次内完成，但后来他们让他一个人做了所有这些工作，推着装满重箱子的手推车。
- en: 'Dariusz had been complaining that his job was too exhausting for him and he
    wanted a different task. But they wouldn’t give him another position. They did
    the exact opposite: they reduced the number of people working the same job, so
    his work got even more exhausting.'

  zh: 达里乌斯一直抱怨他的工作对他来说太过劳累，他希望换一个不同的工作岗位。但他们没有给他调换位置，相反，他们减少了做同样工作的人数，使得他的工作变得更加劳累。
- en: Before Dariusz died, we’d long been trying to get Amazon to carefully examine
    energy expenditure and how hard the work we do is, including Dariusz’s. The company
    is required to do so by law. However, Amazon only roughly estimates how much energy
    workers put in, and doesn’t use an appropriate method to calculate it. A few years
    ago, we managed to persuade the Labor Inspectorate and CIOP (Central Institute
    for Labor Protection) to investigate the cases of several employees; some of them
    were putting in up to twice as much as the allowed levels.

  zh: 在达里乌斯去世之前，我们一直在努力说服亚马逊认真审查能量消耗和我们所做工作的艰辛程度，包括达里乌斯的工作。根据法律，公司有义务这样做。然而，亚马逊只是粗略估算工人们的能量投入，并且没有使用适当的方法来计算。几年前，我们成功说服劳工检查局和CIOP（中央劳动保护研究所）调查了几名员工的案例；其中一些人的工作强度高达允许水平的两倍。
- en: We have court judgments that say that Amazon does not examine this properly.
    But this is dangerous, especially as each of us has some health issues, and some
    of us have been doing hard physical work for years. After Dariusz’s death, I told
    the media that [this past dispute] was probably the real reason for my dismissal.

  zh: 我们有法院判决说亚马逊没有正确审查这个问题。但这是危险的，尤其是因为我们每个人都有一些健康问题，而且我们中的一些人多年来一直在从事辛苦的体力工作。达里乌斯去世后，我告诉媒体说，[这场过去的争议]可能是我被解雇的真正原因。
- en: On the Sunday before Dariusz died, he asked the supervisor to transfer him to
    another department because he was fed up with working too hard. Despite the requests,
    he continued to work alone at his post for about five hours. The next morning
    Dariusz collapsed and died on the floor of the warehouse. They didn’t really help
    him, despite his symptoms. He was told to go through the warehouse — the size
    of a dozen or so soccer fields — on his own, to go down the stairs to the medical
    room. When he got there, he died.

  zh: 在达里乌斯去世前的那个星期天，他请求主管将他调到另一个部门，因为他对过度劳累感到厌倦。尽管有这些请求，他继续在他的岗位上独自工作了大约五个小时。第二天早上，达里乌斯倒在仓库的地板上死去。尽管有症状，他们并没有真正帮助他。他被告知独自穿过有几十个足球场大小的仓库，走下楼梯去医务室。当他到达那里时，他已经去世。
