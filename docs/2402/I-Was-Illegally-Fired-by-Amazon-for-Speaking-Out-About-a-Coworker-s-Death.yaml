- en: Dariusz had all the signs of experiencing a heart attack, but apparently that
    was not the medical reason. His wife told me his heart was broken. That’s why
    this was such an important case for us. Dariusz worked so hard. His job used to
    be done by a few people during a shift, but then they made him do all that work
    alone, pushing around trolleys with heavy boxes.

    wanted a different task. But they wouldn’t give him another position. They did
    the exact opposite: they reduced the number of people working the same job, so
    his work got even more exhausting.'

- en: Before Dariusz died, we’d long been trying to get Amazon to carefully examine
    energy expenditure and how hard the work we do is, including Dariusz’s. The company
    is required to do so by law. However, Amazon only roughly estimates how much energy
    workers put in, and doesn’t use an appropriate method to calculate it. A few years
    ago, we managed to persuade the Labor Inspectorate and CIOP (Central Institute
    for Labor Protection) to investigate the cases of several employees; some of them
    were putting in up to twice as much as the allowed levels.

    But this is dangerous, especially as each of us has some health issues, and some
    of us have been doing hard physical work for years. After Dariusz’s death, I told
    the media that [this past dispute] was probably the real reason for my dismissal.

- en: On the Sunday before Dariusz died, he asked the supervisor to transfer him to
    another department because he was fed up with working too hard. Despite the requests,
    he continued to work alone at his post for about five hours. The next morning
    Dariusz collapsed and died on the floor of the warehouse. They didn’t really help
    him, despite his symptoms. He was told to go through the warehouse — the size
    of a dozen or so soccer fields — on his own, to go down the stairs to the medical
    room. When he got there, he died.
