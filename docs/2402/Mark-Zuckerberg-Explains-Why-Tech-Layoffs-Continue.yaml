- en: During the pandemic, e-commerce sales went through the roof, which drove big
    gains in online advertising. But as people returned to stores and the economy
    adjusted, sales growth ebbed and ad rates returned to Earth. Many companies, including
    Meta, realized they had over-hired and had to make major cuts.

    due to companies trying to navigate COVID," Zuckerberg said in the interview when
    asked if tech layoffs had to do with the AI boom.'

    because of overhiring — they're now realizing there can be benefits to being leaner.

    cared about," Zuckerberg said in the interview, speaking specifically about Meta''s
    past layoffs. "But in some ways actually becoming leaner kind of makes the company
