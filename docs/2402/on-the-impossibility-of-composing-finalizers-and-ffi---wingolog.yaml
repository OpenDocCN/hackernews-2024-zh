    I remembered why I don’t much do this any more: it is impossible to compose GC
    with explicit ownership.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Allow me to illustrate with an example. Harfbuzz has a concept of *blobs*, which
    are refcounted sequences of bytes. It uses these in a number of places, for example
    when loading OpenType fonts. You can get a peek at the blob’s contents back with
    [`hb_blob_get_data`](https://harfbuzz.github.io/harfbuzz-hb-blob.html#hb-blob-get-data),
    which gives you a pointer and a length.

    day long; now I can hardly remember.) You get a blob from somewhere and want to
    get its data. You define a wrapper for `hb_blob_get_data`:'

    as a byte string.

- en: 'The thing is, this code is as correct as you can get it, but it’s not correct
    enough. In between the call to `hb_blob_get_data` and, well, anything else, GC
    could run, and if `blob` is not used in the future of the program execution (the
    continuation), then it could be collected, causing the `hb_blob_destroy` finalizer
    to release the last reference on the blob, freeing `contents`: we would then be
    accessing invalid memory.'

- en: Among GC implementors, it is a truth universally acknowledged that a program
    containing finalizers must be in want of a segfault. The semantics of LuaJIT do
    not prescribe when GC can happen and what values will be live, so the GC and the
    compiler are not constrained to extend the liveness of `blob` to, say, the entirety
    of its lexical scope. It is perfectly valid to collect `blob` after its last use,
    and so at some point a GC will evolve to do just that.

- en: 'I chose LuaJIT not to pick on it, but rather because its FFI is very straightforward.
    All other languages with GC that I am aware of have this same issue. There are
    but two work-arounds, and neither are satisfactory: either develop a deep and
    correct knowledge of what the compiler and run-time will do for a given piece
    of code, and then pray that knowledge does not go out of date, or attempt to manually
    extend the lifetime of a finalizable object, and then pray the compiler and GC
    don’t learn new tricks to invalidate your trick.'

- en: This latter strategy takes the form of [“remember-this” procedures that are
    designed to outsmart the compiler](https://github.com/ivmai/bdwgc/blob/master/include/gc/gc.h#L1469-L1491).
    They have mostly worked for the last few decades, but I wouldn’t bet on them in
    the future.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Another way to look at the problem is that once you have a system working—though,
    how would you know it’s correct?—then you either never update the compiler and
    run-time, or you become fast friends with whoever maintains your GC, and probably
    your compiler too.

- en: For more on this topic, as always Hans Boehm has the first and last word; see
    for example the 2002 [*Destructors, finalizers, and synchronization*](https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/document?repid=rep1&type=pdf&doi=ac6669e60ef9ae9adbf3e596377d731584c27049).
    These considerations don’t really apply to *destructors*, which are used in languages
    with ownership and generally run synchronously.
