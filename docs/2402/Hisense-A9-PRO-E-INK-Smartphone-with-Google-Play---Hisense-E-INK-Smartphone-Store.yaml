    If you are a big fan of high quality sound, the A9 is utilizing the ES9318 chip
    which allows for HiFi quality sound output while having integrated support for
    the LDAC, AAC, SBC, and APTX Bluetooth audio codecs. This makes the new A9 great
    for not only listening to audiobooks but some quality music as well. For the best
    sound possible, you will want to plug in wired headphones via the 3.4mm headphone
    jack. There is also a small speaker on the bottom and also a microphone. There
