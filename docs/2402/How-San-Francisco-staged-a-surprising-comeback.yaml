- en: Whenever a global economic transformation takes place, a single city usually
    drives it forward. Ghent, in modern-day Belgium, was at the core of the burgeoning
    global wool trade in the 13th century. The first initial public offering took
    place in Amsterdam in 1602\. London was the financial centre of the first wave
    of globalisation during the 19th century. And today that city is San Francisco.

- en: California’s commercial capital has no serious rival in generative [artificial
    intelligence](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/04/20/how-to-worry-wisely-about-artificial-intelligence)
    (AI), a breakthrough technology that has caused a bull market in American stocks,
    and which many hope will power a global productivity surge. Almost all big AI
    startups have their headquarters in the Bay Area, which includes San Francisco
    and Silicon Valley (largely based in Santa Clara County, to the south). OpenAI
    is there, of course; so are Anthropic, Databricks and Scale AI. Tech giants, including
    Meta and Microsoft, are also spending heavily on AI in the city. According to
    Brookings Metro, a think-tank, last year San Francisco accounted for close to
    a tenth of generative-AI job postings in America, more than anywhere else. New
    York, with four times as many residents, was second.
