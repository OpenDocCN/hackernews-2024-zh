- en: That’s the radical vision proposed by philosophy professor and Marxist scholar
    Kohei Saito. In 2020, as residents in Japan hunkered down during the early stages
    of the COVID-19 pandemic, Saito published a book that would eventually become
    a surprise bestseller, titled *Capital in the Anthropocene*. Relentless consumption
    and production, the drivers of economic growth, have fueled the climate crisis
    and global inequality, Saito argues in the book. He instead promotes degrowth
    — a deliberate shrinking of the economy — as a way to redistribute resources and
    shift to a slower economic system that prioritizes human welfare and planetary
    well-being.

    —— 一种有意缩小经济的方式 —— 作为重新分配资源并转向更缓慢的经济体系的途径，该体系优先考虑人类福祉和地球福祉。

    than 500,000 copies in Japan, has been translated into multiple languages, and

    translation, titled [*Slow Down: The Degrowth Manifesto*](https://astrapublishinghouse.com/product/slow-down-9781662602368/),
    was released in the United States. “Even I thought my ideas were too radical to
    find much of an audience,” Saito writes in the introduction to the English edition.
    “Who would read a book on ‘degrowth communism’ written by a basically unknown
    scholar of political thought in the Marxist tradition?”'

    斋藤在英文版引言中写道。“谁会读一本由一位基本上是马克思主义政治思想的未知学者写的关于‘退行共产主义’的书呢？”
- en: Yet Saito’s book has found readers across the world who want to listen. In Japan,
    when his book was initially released in 2020, decades of economic stagnation and
    neoliberal reform had crystallized into open frustration as the pandemic widened
    existing inequalities. For some, the COVID crisis shed light on how policies oriented
    around economic growth had failed to prevent either the pandemic or rising greenhouse

    危机揭示了围绕经济增长的政策如何未能阻止疫情或温室气体排放的上升。

    debating [whether countries should deprioritize economic growth to slow global
    warming](https://grist.org/politics/post-covid-should-countries-rethink-their-obsession-with-economic-growth/).
    On one hand, building out renewable energy and clean technologies will necessarily
    lead to new jobs and more economic activity. Developing countries also need to
    grow their economies to raise standards of living. But degrowth advocates, including
    Saito and economists like [Jason Hickel](https://bigthink.com/the-present/economic-growth-is-killing-us/)
    and [Tim Jackson](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2021/may/06/post-growth-by-tim-jackson-review-life-after-capitalism),
    say that simply swapping in clean energy for fossil fuels isn’t enough. They argue
    that high-income countries, responsible for the lion’s share of global greenhouse
    gas emissions, should also reduce energy use and resource extraction from developing
    nations, while focusing on providing the basics — such as food, clean water, shelter,
    and energy — to residents at no cost.
