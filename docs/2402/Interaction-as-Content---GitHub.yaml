    email, where you (or your email server) need to deliver each email to all recipients

    concepts of blocking, accepting follow requests, etc.).

    publishing some others to some more private feed with friends or co-workers access.

    which can be modelled as two-way interaction. For example, if **Alice** comments

    something and notifying **Alice**. In a pull-based system though, **Bob** needs
    to query everyone who he knows and might've said something, to check whether what
    they've said is a comment on his post or not. Which is orders of magnitude more
    difficult.

    quotes, etc), both designs are lacking in the content discovery area in a broader
    sense, and in both cases you'd need to have third-party aggregators / crawlers
    / search services for that, similar to what search engines do for the distributed
    world of web pages.

    content.

    not supporting it can also [be cheaply bridged](https://gist.github.com/thefranke/63853a6f8c499dc97bc17838f6cedcc2).
    Top that with a nice search / aggregator, and you've effectively made the borders
    between various communities disappear for your users (I don't need to follow someone
    on YouTube to miss their content on Twitch. I can follow them anywhere in one

    as well. But, with such a model, publishing is completely separated from distribution,
    meaning no one can bar anyone from publishing and their direct subscribers receiving
    their content (except the ISPs?). However, anyone can refuse to help distribute
    anything they don't like, as this is not in anyway hindering publishing of said
    content, and there is no exclusivity on distribution as well.

    and distribution is done exlusively by the central platform operator as well,

    to be published". Even in a federated system, a server might decide they don't
    want to allow me to push content to my followers on that server anymore, effectively
    cutting off access.

    separation plays a great role in the financials of content generation as well,
    the same way that the distribution that lead to anyone with their own website
    accessible through search engines also lead to new, more open monetisation models
    (that are of course not without their flaws).
