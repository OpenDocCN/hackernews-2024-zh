    Krishnamoorthi (D-IL) of the House Select Committee on the Strategic Competition
    between the United States and the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) unveiled the findings
    of their [bipartisan investigation](//selectcommitteeontheccp.house.gov/media/letters/letters-venture-capital-firms-funding-problematic-prc-companies) into
    five U.S. venture capital firms. The lawmakers found that these firms invested
    at least $3 billion in, and provided expertise and other benefits to, People''s
    Republic of China (PRC) critical technology companies, including many aiding the
    Chinese military, surveillance state, or the CCP''s genocide in Xinjiang.'

    Ventures, Qualcomm Ventures, Sequoia Capital China, and Walden International.
    Chairman Gallagher and Ranking Member Krishnamoorthi uncovered that these firms
    funneled over $1.9 billion to AI companies that support China’s human rights abuses
    or military, and at least another $1.2 billion into the PRC’s semiconductor sector–
    including semiconductor companies that advance the CCP’s military, genocidal,
    and techno-totalitarian ambitions. The report also highlights other investments
    that may raise significant security or human rights concerns.

    are billions of dollars beyond those captured in this report that have flowed
    into PRC companies that support the PRC’s military, digital authoritarianism,
    and efforts to develop technological supremacy and undermine American technological
    leadership. The status quo is untenable. . . . Decades of investment—including
    funding, knowledge transfer, and other intangible benefits—from U.S. VCs have
    helped build and strengthen the PRC’s priority sectors.”
