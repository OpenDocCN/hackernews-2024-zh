    social media companies may conduct content moderation and alter First Amendment
    jurisprudence. The consolidated cases, *NetChoice v. Paxton* and *Moody v. NetChoice*,
    assess the constitutionality of two state laws, one in Texas and the other in
    Florida, that limit social media companies’ ability to conduct content moderation.
    The states claim that social media companies are discriminating against conservatives,
    violating the First Amendment rights of those users. Social media companies claim
    such restrictions violate their First Amendment rights because they amount to
    compelled speech and state censorship.

    (SB 7072), which addresses the content moderation practices of prominent social
    media platforms. The law restricts platforms with more than 100 million users
    per month or an annual gross revenue of more than $100 million from removing or
    moderating the content of “journalistic enterprise[s]” based on the content of
    their posts, and also prohibits platforms from applying “post-prioritization”
    or “shadow banning” algorithms to content posted “by or about” a known political
    candidate. Censorship is defined broadly to include, among other things, appending
    notes to posts, content removal, and “shadow banning”—described in the bill as
    an “action by a social media platform, through any means, whether the action is
    determined by a natural person or an algorithm, to limit or eliminate the exposure
    of a user or content or material posted by a user to other users of the social
    media platform.”

    which held unconstitutional a statute requiring newspapers to publish replies
    to editorials because the law interfered with the newspapers’ First Amendment
    right to editorial discretion. The Court reasoned that newspapers are unlike broadcasting
    channels, which are “common carriers” and therefore have a special interest in
    ensuring neutrality. The “common carrier” label is a common law legal status for
    businesses, such as internet service providers, that serve a critical public function.

- en: Distinguishing social media platforms from common carriers, the Eleventh Circuit
    held unconstitutional the provisions restricting the platforms’ content moderation
    practices. Traditionally, common law courts have determined that governments maintained
    a significant interest in anti-discrimination regulation with respect to common
    carriers. Governments have, therefore, historically regulated common carriers
    substantially—especially when ensuring equal access to the services of a carrier.
    The Eleventh Circuit panel rejected Florida’s argument that social media companies
    should be considered common carriers. The judges found that, unlike other public
    services where there is no expectation of discrimination in providing services,
    platforms explicitly inform users from the beginning that they will, per the platforms’
    First Amendment right, discriminate against certain types of content. The panel
    also concluded that labeling the platforms as common carriers would not necessarily
    override the relevant First Amendment rights.

  zh: 区分社交媒体平台和普通运营商，第十一巡回法院裁定限制平台内容管理实践的规定违宪。传统上，普通法法院认为政府在反歧视监管方面对普通运营商维护了重大利益。因此，政府在很大程度上历来对普通运营商进行监管，尤其是在确保平等获取运营商服务方面。第十一巡回法院小组驳回了佛罗里达州认为社交媒体公司应视为普通运营商的论点。法官们发现，与在提供服务时没有歧视预期的其他公共服务不同，这些平台从一开始就明确告知用户它们将根据平台的第一修正案权利来歧视某些类型的内容。小组还得出结论，将这些平台标记为普通运营商不一定会覆盖相关的第一修正案权利。
- en: Finally, when analyzing the law’s individual disclosure requirements mandating
    that platforms thoroughly explain moderation decisions to users who had their
    content removed, the Eleventh Circuit based its reasoning on a test constructed
    by the Supreme Court in [*Zauderer v. Office of Disciplinary Counsel of Supreme
    Court of Ohio*](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/471/626/). Zauderer
    held that governments could require advertisers to include disclosures in their
    advertisements to prevent advertisers from misleading consumers, and the Court
    created a test for determining whether the government could compel disclosure.
    The test permits states to compel commercial speech that is “purely factual and
    uncontroversial information” so long as the speech is not so “‘unduly burdensome”
    such that it would “chill[] protected commercial speech.” In previous cases, [the
    Supreme Court recognized commercial](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/425/748/)
    speech as low-value speech that receives less protection under the First Amendment.
    Although the panel noted that “it is not substantially likely that the [law’s
    other] disclosure provisions are unconstitutional,” the panel agreed with NetChoice
    that individualized explanation requirements were “‘practically impossible to
    satisfy’” and were, therefore, “unduly burdensome and likely to chill platforms’
    protected speech.”

  zh: 最后，在分析法律规定的个体披露要求，要求平台向被删除内容的用户彻底解释审查决定时，第十一巡回上诉法院基于最高法院在[*Zauderer v. Office
    of Disciplinary Counsel of Supreme Court of Ohio*](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/471/626/)案中构建的测试进行推理。Zauderer案认为政府可以要求广告商在广告中包含披露以防止广告商误导消费者，并为确定政府是否能强制披露创建了一个测试。该测试允许州政府强制包含“纯粹事实和无争议信息”的商业言论，只要这种言论不至于“过度负担”以至于“抑制受保护的商业言论”。在之前的案例中，[最高法院认定商业言论](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/425/748/)是受第一修正案保护较少的低价值言论。尽管小组指出“法律的其他披露规定不大可能违宪”，但小组同意NetChoice的观点，即个性化解释要求“‘几乎不可能满足’”，因此“过度负担且可能抑制平台的受保护言论”。

    Under the law, the state attorney general or Texas social media users whose posts

    a business establishment that holds itself open to the public has no “expressive”
    interest in who is allowed to speak in the establishment. The Fifth Circuit determined

    the public equally” and, therefore, have no expressive interest in censoring speech.

    third-party content—as an independent right. Instead, the Fifth Circuit explained

    not speech, there is no threat that the disclosure requirements would chill speech.
    The Fifth Circuit also noted that many companies already comply with this requirement,
    demonstrating that compliance would not be a “heavy burden.” Finally, the Fifth
    Circuit addressed the platforms’ arguments that *Zauderer* should not apply because
    content moderation decisions were not “‘purely factual and uncontroversial information’”

    *any* censorship applied to posts made by journalistic enterprises, which could
    include explicit speech from the platform, such as appending warnings—which would
    be permitted under the Texas law. Yet the Fifth Circuit explicitly departed from
    the Eleventh Circuit on the questions of whether editorial discretion is an independent
    right, whether the compulsion of individualized explanations passes the *Zauderer*
    test and is therefore permissible, and whether the common carrier doctrine applies

    The solicitor general asserted that the explanations are a “heavy burden” because,

- en: The states relied on two Supreme Court decisions to support this characterization
    of moderation. First, citing [*Pruneyard Shopping Cente**r*](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/447/74/)*,*
    the states equated social media platforms to malls, supporting the notion that
    these platforms do not have an expressive interest in censoring certain content.
    The states argued that just as a mall does not have an expressive interest in
    determining what kind of flyers are distributed on their premises, platforms do
    not have an expressive interest in censoring certain types of speech. The second
    case the states relied on, [*Rumsfeld v. Forum for Academic and Institutional
    Rights*](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/547/47/) (FAIR), deemed constitutional
    a law requiring schools to permit military recruiters on campus. The states reasoned
    that since *FAIR* held that hosting speech was non-expressive conduct (which meant
    it could be regulated), the government could similarly compel social media companies
    to host speech on their platforms. The states contended, quoting Florida’s brief,
    that compelling the platforms to host content maintains the core First Amendment
    value of an “‘uninhibited marketplace of ideas.’”

  zh: 州方依赖于两起最高法院的裁决来支持对这种温和行为的描述。首先，引用[*Pruneyard Shopping Cente**r*](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/447/74/)一案，州方将社交媒体平台等同于商场，支持这样一种观点：这些平台没有在审查某些内容方面表达利益。州方主张，就像商场没有表达利益决定在其场地上分发何种传单一样，平台也没有在审查某些类型的言论上表达利益。州方依赖的第二起案件是[*Rumsfeld
    v. Forum for Academic and Institutional Rights*](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/547/47/)（FAIR），该案认为一项要求学校允许军事招聘人员进入校园的法律合宪。州方推理称，既然*FAIR*案认为主持言论是非表达性行为（这意味着它可以被监管），政府同样可以强制社交媒体公司在其平台上主持言论。州方辩称，援引佛罗里达州的简报，强制平台主持内容维护了第一修正案的核心价值，“‘无拘束的思想市场’”。
- en: The states asserted that social media platforms should be characterized as common
    carriers, which, Florida and Texas wrote, would allow the states to impose the
    requirements on the platforms contained in SB 7072 and HB 20\. The states argued
    that courts and Congress have generally classified as common carriers entities
    that disseminate or facilitate others’ speech, including telephone companies and
    internet service providers. And courts have recognized that governments have a
    particular interest in regulating common carriers and enforcing anti-discrimination
    laws—as carriers play a unique and essential role in society by providing travel,
    communication, and other services to the general public, usually with a license
    from the government.

- en: Addressing the individual disclosure provisions last, the states contended that
    the provisions are constitutional because the laws compel disclosure of only factual
    and uncontroversial information about a platform’s terms of service. The states
    argued that the laws’ disclosure requirements were not overly burdensome—as required
    by *Zauderer*. The states asserted that currently the companies voluntarily provide
    explanations for their moderation decisions, so they would only need to alter
    their current system slightly if they are not already compliant. Relying on *Zauderer*,
    Florida argued that the platforms have only minimal First Amendment interests
    in withholding moderation information, and the state has a legitimate governmental
    interest in requiring the disclosure. Florida also encouraged the Supreme Court
    to reconsider the Eleventh Circuit’s decision regarding the individual disclosure
    provisions given the minimal lower court record on this point. And Texas asserted
    that *Zauderer*’s heavy burden only refers to the burden on speech and not operational
    or administrative burdens.

    that its law could even survive [strict scrutiny](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/576/155/),

    [Yelp](http://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/22/22-277/292477/20231206160217571_Yelp%20NetChoice%20Amicus%20Brief.pdf),

    stated that their ability to moderate content supports the First Amendment rights
    of all their users and the platform’s rights by allowing individuals to freely
    build communities and associate online as they see fit, which includes removing
    unwanted content. In its brief, the Internet Society, a nonprofit organization,
    [contended that](http://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/22/22-277/292675/20231207150553007_ISOC_NetChoice_Final%20Brief.pdf)
    maintaining the ability to moderate can encourage speech, given that moderation
    and guidelines make users feel safe. Many other amici also pointed out that allowing

    that](http://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/22/22-277/292351/20231205170151755_RCFP%20-%20NetChoice%20v.%20Paxton%20for%20Filing%20PDF-A.pdf)
    the Supreme Court define platforms as publishers similar to newspapers and apply
    *Tornillo*, giving the platforms a First Amendment right to moderate content as
    part of their editorial discretion. Meanwhile, [other amici noted that](https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/22/22-555/298443/20240123125628681_22-555%20Amicus%20Brief%20of%20Life%20Legal%20Defense%20Foundation.pdf),
    unlike newspapers, social media platforms only review content after a user generates
    and attempts to publish the content, an editorial process meaningfully different
    from that conducted by newspapers. These amici contended that the Supreme Court
    should apply *Pruneyard* and treat platforms like malls—areas that are held open
    for the public to congregate. Still [other amici encouraged the Supreme Court](http://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/22/22-277/292747/20231207162801550_NetChoice_Merits_Final.pdf)
    to overrule *Pruneyard* altogether, arguing that even if platforms are more similar
    to malls, the Supreme Court’s ruling in *Pruneyard* is not consistent with conventional
    and historical understandings of the First Amendment.

  zh: 当涉及应用*普鲁尼亚德（Pruneyard）*或*托尼略（Tornillo）*时，[一些友人建议最高法院将平台定义为类似报纸的出版商，并应用*托尼略*，赋予平台在其编辑裁量权中进行内容调节的第一修正案权利。同时，[其他友人指出](http://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/22/22-277/292351/20231205170151755_RCFP%20-%20NetChoice%20v.%20Paxton%20for%20Filing%20PDF-A.pdf)，与报纸不同，社交媒体平台仅在用户生成和尝试发布内容后审查内容，这一编辑过程与报纸进行的编辑过程有着显著不同。这些友人主张最高法院应用*普鲁尼亚德*，将平台视为类似商场的地方——这些地方为公众聚集而开放。还有[其他友人鼓励最高法院](http://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/22/22-277/292747/20231207162801550_NetChoice_Merits_Final.pdf)完全撤销*普鲁尼亚亚德*，认为即使平台更类似于商场，*普鲁尼亚亚德*案的最高法院裁决与第一修正案的传统和历史理解不一致。

    about the dangerous practical consequences of significant restrictions on moderation.
    These [briefs asserted that](http://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/22/22-277/292658/20231207144147630_22-277_22-555_Amicus%20Brief.pdf)
    content moderation conducted by the platforms helps curb real-world violence that
    flows from hateful or violent content online. [One amicus brief filed by](http://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/22/22-277/292678/20231207150927259_22-277%20-555%20Amici%20Brief%20of%20Nat%20Sec%20Officials%20Final.pdf)
    a group of national security experts (including former government officials) argued
    that because government actors are more limited than private actors by the First
    Amendment in their ability to counter disinformation and propaganda online, “[i]t
    is vitally important to our national security that social media platforms continue
    to make efforts to moderate extremist content, disinformation, and propaganda.”
    The First Amendment, according to this brief, is intended as a limitation on the
    government’s ability to infringe on the speech of private actors. Therefore, allowing
    private actors to conduct content moderation is critical to combating malign actors
    operating in privately owned spaces online. The amici contend that the platforms
    should be given sufficient latitude to use their technical expertise in this area
    to effectively fulfill this role.

- en: If the Court fully accepts the states' arguments, the federal government and
    state governments will be granted much broader authority to regulate platforms’
    moderation. Laws similar to the two at issue here would either not implicate the
    First Amendment or be subject only to intermediate scrutiny by courts. Meanwhile,
    if the Court fully accepts the NetChoice arguments, it would affirmatively establish
    that platforms’ moderation is expressive conduct that qualifies as editorial discretion—like
    that of newspapers—protected by the First Amendment.

  zh: 如果法院完全接受州方的论点，联邦政府和州政府将被授予更广泛的权力来规范平台的内容管理。类似于本案涉及的两项法律将要么不触及第一修正案，要么只受到法院中间审查的约束。与此同时，如果法院完全接受了NetChoice的论点，它将肯定地确认平台的内容管理是符合第一修正案保护的表达性行为，类似于报纸的编辑自由。
- en: The Court may also accept some combination of the states’ and NetChoice’s arguments.
    For example, the Court may hold that the government can regulate a platform’s
    content moderation practices [but that the laws in question are not sufficiently
    tailored](https://www.yalejreg.com/nc/the-platforms-should-win-the-netchoice-content-moderation-cases-but-narrowly-by-kyle-langvardt-alan-z-rozenshtein/)
    to accomplish the government's interests. The Court may also hold that social
    media platforms should be considered common carriers, but that defining platforms
    as such does not strip platforms of First Amendment rights. Any combination of
    these outcomes is still very likely to shift how social media platforms can and
    choose to moderate content and what kinds of regulations governments may enact.

  zh: 法院也可能接受州方和NetChoice的论点的某种组合。例如，法院可能认为政府可以规范平台的内容管理做法，[但问题法律未能足够地精细地制定](https://www.yalejreg.com/nc/the-platforms-should-win-the-netchoice-content-moderation-cases-but-narrowly-by-kyle-langvardt-alan-z-rozenshtein/)以实现政府的利益。法院也可能认为社交媒体平台应被视为公共运输工具，但这种定义并不剥夺平台的第一修正案权利。这些结果的任何组合仍极有可能改变社交媒体平台如何管理内容以及政府可以制定何种类型的法规。
