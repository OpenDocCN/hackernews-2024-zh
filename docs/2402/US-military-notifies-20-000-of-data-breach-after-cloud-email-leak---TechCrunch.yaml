    U.S. government cloud email server that was spilling sensitive emails to the open
    internet](https://techcrunch.com/2023/02/21/sensitive-united-states-military-emails-spill-online/).
    The cloud email server, hosted on Microsoft’s cloud for government customers,
    was accessible from the internet without a password, likely due to a misconfiguration.
