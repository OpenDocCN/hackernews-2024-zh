# Killing VMware – Computerworld

> 来源：[https://www.computerworld.com/article/3713242/killing-vmware.html](https://www.computerworld.com/article/3713242/killing-vmware.html)

Well, I hate to tell you, Broadcom — but from what I’m hearing, your customers and partners disagree. VMware’s rivals, including [Nutanix](https://www.nutanix.com/). [Scale Computing](https://www.scalecomputing.com/), and [Virtuozzo](https://www.virtuozzo.com/), are loving it, though. Bigger companies, such as Microsoft with Hyper-V/Azure Stack and Red Hat with OpenShift Virtualization, also have reason to put VMware customers at the top of their marketing list. 

Besides the VMware licensing change, which is always worrisome, VMware customers are also worried sick about the new line’s pricing. Even before Broadcom bought the company, VMware was expensive. They’re afraid, with reason, that they’ll pay even more.

VMware’s once-flourishing partners are also concerned. Most companies don’t work with VMware directly. They worked with partners, instead. First, [Broadcom dumped all its resellers and service partners](https://www.crn.com/news/virtualization/broadcom-hands-vmware-partners-termination-notice). Then, it opened the door for its top former partners to come back in. Did they? Well, [VMware also took its top 2,000 customers](https://www.crn.com/news/virtualization/2024/broadcom-takes-top-vmware-accounts-direct-effective-immediately) [direct](https://www.crn.com/news/virtualization/2024/broadcom-takes-top-vmware-accounts-direct-effective-immediately),  which doesn’t leave much room for VMware’s former partners. The VMware partner slogan, “VMware Partners: An Ecosystem of Trust,” sure sounds hollow.
