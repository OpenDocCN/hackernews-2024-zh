- en: Thank you for jumping on this last-minute Zoom meeting. As you’re all well aware,
    this has been a great year for us. Profits are at an all-time high. Our stock
    price is at an all-time high. Growth projections for the coming year are through
    the roof. You all have done an amazing job ushering in a new era of success for
    this company. So amazing, in fact, that we have no choice but to let you all go.

  zh: 感谢你们能在最后一刻参加这次Zoom会议。如大家所知，对我们来说，这是一个很棒的一年。利润达到了历史新高。股价也达到了历史新高。未来一年的增长预期简直破表。你们所有人在带领公司迎来成功新时代方面做得太棒了。事实上，太棒了以至于我们别无选择，只能让你们全部离职。
- en: I realize this comes as a shock, but I don’t want any of you to worry about
    the future. Thanks to you, we are in an excellent position to ride out the challenges
    of the coming year. I mean, those of us who still work here are. But I’m sure
    you all will be fine too. You’re top-level contributors. You’ll surely help any
    company you join become successful enough to no longer need you, as long as you
    don’t do one of the jobs we’re all replacing with AI. About 60 percent of you
    will be A-OK, in the very short term. You have my non–legally binding word on
    that.

  zh: 我意识到这消息可能会让你们感到震惊，但我不希望你们为未来感到担忧。多亏了你们，我们处于一个非常良好的位置，能够应对未来一年的挑战。我是说，那些仍然在这里工作的人是这样。但我相信你们所有人也会没事的。你们是顶尖的贡献者。只要你们不从事我们都将由AI来替代的工作之一，你们一定会帮助任何一家公司取得成功，直至它们不再需要你们。大约60%的人在短期内都会很好。这是我非正式的承诺。
- en: But let’s not linger on the very real problems this most recent evolution of
    capitalism has put before you. You should take a moment to celebrate yourselves.
    You crushed it. You’ve helped us grow so much that the only possible way for you
    to continue to help us grow is by no longer working here, effective immediately.
    That’s quite an achievement, although I do acknowledge it sounds a little nonsensical.
    Frankly, I’m not sure I even understand exactly how it works. Maybe one of you
    can explain it to me before you leave? You’re our best and brightest, after all.
    Well, you are for the next twenty minutes or so.

  zh: 但让我们不要深陷在最新资本主义演进带给你们的真实问题中。你们应该停下来庆祝一下自己。你们厉害啊。你们帮助我们成长了这么多，以至于你们继续帮助我们成长的唯一可能方式就是立即不再在这里工作。这真是一个成就，虽然我承认听起来有点不合常理。坦白说，我甚至不确定它到底是如何运作的。也许你们中的某个人在离开之前能解释给我听？毕竟，你们是我们最优秀的人才。好吧，至少在接下来的二十分钟里是这样。
- en: So keep your heads high. You’ll leave here knowing we couldn’t have been successful
    enough to fire you without you. That it was your proud and noble contributions
    that ultimately enabled us to stop giving you a salary and benefits. And at the
    end of the day, isn’t that more valuable than money? I guess no, not according
    to our board and shareholders. But they’re not as proud and noble as you, the
    chosen few (I think 20 percent of our workforce counts as “few”). They may come
    away from this whole ordeal with a few more points on their shares, but you’ll
    get to walk away knowing that, for the small sacrifice of your ability to pay
    your mortgages or buy food, you provided those points. That makes you the big
    winners in all this, in my eyes.

  zh: 所以请昂首挺胸。你们将离开这里，知道我们之所以能够解雇你们，完全依赖于你们的贡献。正是你们的自豪和高贵的贡献最终使我们能够停止支付你们的工资和福利。而在一天结束时，这难道不比金钱更有价值吗？我认为不，至少董事会和股东们认为不是。但他们没有你们这么自豪和高贵，你们这些被挑选的少数（我认为我们工作人员中20%算是“少数”）。他们也许会从整个事件中获得更多股票分数，但你们将离开，知道你们为了能不能付房贷或买食物而做出了牺牲，提供了这些分数。在我的眼中，这使你们成为这一切中的大赢家。
- en: Honestly, if it weren’t for the fact that my equity doesn’t vest for another
    six months, I might even consider joining you, you noble, fallen warriors. But
    no, my sad fate is to fail upward and look on with jealousy and admiration as
    you all succeed downward. I envy you. I really do.

  zh: 老实说，如果不是因为我的股权还有六个月才能解锁，我或许甚至会考虑加入你们，你们这些高尚的、倒下的战士们。但是不，我可怜的命运是向上失败，眼睁睁地看着你们一路成功下去而羡慕与崇拜。我真的很羡慕你们。

    servers. Can’t be too careful, right? Anyway, as I was saying, you’ll all be treated
    with the utmost respect from now until we get your laptops back. Please try to
    have those in the mail by the end of the day, by the way.

  zh: —抱歉，我想你们所有人都因为IT终止了对公司服务器的访问权限而被强制退出了。不能太大意，对吧？无论如何，正如我刚才说的，从现在开始，我们将会对你们一视同仁，直到我们把你们的笔记本电脑送回来。顺便说一句，请尽量在今天结束前把它们寄出去。
