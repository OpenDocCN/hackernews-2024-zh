- en: Thank you for jumping on this last-minute Zoom meeting. As you’re all well aware,
    this has been a great year for us. Profits are at an all-time high. Our stock
    price is at an all-time high. Growth projections for the coming year are through
    the roof. You all have done an amazing job ushering in a new era of success for
    this company. So amazing, in fact, that we have no choice but to let you all go.

    the future. Thanks to you, we are in an excellent position to ride out the challenges
    of the coming year. I mean, those of us who still work here are. But I’m sure
    you all will be fine too. You’re top-level contributors. You’ll surely help any
    company you join become successful enough to no longer need you, as long as you
    don’t do one of the jobs we’re all replacing with AI. About 60 percent of you
    will be A-OK, in the very short term. You have my non–legally binding word on
    that.

- en: But let’s not linger on the very real problems this most recent evolution of
    capitalism has put before you. You should take a moment to celebrate yourselves.
    You crushed it. You’ve helped us grow so much that the only possible way for you
    to continue to help us grow is by no longer working here, effective immediately.
    That’s quite an achievement, although I do acknowledge it sounds a little nonsensical.
    Frankly, I’m not sure I even understand exactly how it works. Maybe one of you
    can explain it to me before you leave? You’re our best and brightest, after all.
    Well, you are for the next twenty minutes or so.

    enough to fire you without you. That it was your proud and noble contributions
    that ultimately enabled us to stop giving you a salary and benefits. And at the
    end of the day, isn’t that more valuable than money? I guess no, not according
    to our board and shareholders. But they’re not as proud and noble as you, the
    chosen few (I think 20 percent of our workforce counts as “few”). They may come
    away from this whole ordeal with a few more points on their shares, but you’ll
    get to walk away knowing that, for the small sacrifice of your ability to pay
    your mortgages or buy food, you provided those points. That makes you the big
    winners in all this, in my eyes.

    six months, I might even consider joining you, you noble, fallen warriors. But
    no, my sad fate is to fail upward and look on with jealousy and admiration as
    you all succeed downward. I envy you. I really do.

    with the utmost respect from now until we get your laptops back. Please try to
    have those in the mail by the end of the day, by the way.
