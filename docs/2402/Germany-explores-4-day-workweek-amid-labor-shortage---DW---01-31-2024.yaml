    [find enough workers,](/en/germanys-skilled-workers-shortage/t-65913899) dozens
    of companies are starting an experiment that will see employees work a day less.
    In February, 45 companies and organizations in Europe's largest economy will introduce
    a 4-day workweek for half a year. Employees will continue to receive their full
    salary. The initiative is led by the consulting firm Intraprenör in collaboration
    with the non-profit organization 4 Day Week Global (4DWG).

    a long-held reputation for industriousness and efficiency. Yet, in recent years,
    productivity in Germany has fallen.

    At its core, productivity is measured by dividing economic output by hours worked.
    For the last few years, high energy costs have hurt companies' output, leaving
    them — and the country — with a lower productivity score. If companies can maintain
    their current output with employees working fewer hours, this would naturally
    lead to higher productivity levels. But can they?

- en: Advocates argue yes. Employees who work four days instead of five are more motivated
    and, therefore, more productive, they say. This model could also potentially draw
    more people into the workforce by engaging those who aren't willing to work five
    days a week, helping to alleviate the lack of labor.

    company DAK shows that workers in Germany took 20 sick days on average last year.
    That means illness-related absences caused an overall real income loss of €26
    billion ($28 billion) in Germany in 2023, the German Association of Research-Based
    Pharmaceutical Companies (VFA) said. This would have pushed down economic output
    by 0.8 percentage points.

    likely lead to more concentrated work. Fewer hours would mean a hit to social
    and creative elements of work. Here the consequences wouldn't be immediately felt,
    especially not in studies designed to only last six months.

    even for well-established industrial players. German trade union IG Metall has
    been advocating for shorter working hours for some time. In the steel industry,
    for example, only 35 hours per week are currently worked.
