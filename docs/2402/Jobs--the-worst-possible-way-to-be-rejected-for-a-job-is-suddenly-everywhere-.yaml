    must be the offer*, you think, *or at least a step closer to one*. You clear your
    afternoon, make yourself and your space look presentable, and eagerly log into
    Zoom … only to discover you’ve taken all this trouble just so the hiring manager
    can reject you on live video. Now you’ve got to process the bad news while simultaneously
    controlling your face and your tone and ensuring you sound professional—the whole

  zh: 尽管直播视频拒绝听起来像是一种蓄意的残忍行为，但实际上并非如此。相反，一些招聘经理真诚地认为，在视频通话中拒绝候选人更为礼貌，甚至更为周到。以下是一位面试官关于这种做法写给我的信件内容：
- en: We do it as a matter of policy. If you make it to the final interview stage,
    HR wants us to reject people by Zoom or at least over the phone. They say it’s
    kinder and doesn’t feel as impersonal after people have invested their time interviewing
    with us. Supposedly we owe them the courtesy of a real conversation. But every
    time I’ve done it, the person sounds crushed. It’s horrible.

- en: I tried not to get too emotionally attached to this position, but the truth
    is I really, really wanted this job. … Finally, I received a video meeting invite
    from the hiring manager. The meeting was titled “quick touch-base” with no agenda
    attached and was scheduled for 15 minutes at the very end of a long day. Since
    I had no idea what to expect, I dressed in a full suit, made sure my hair and
    makeup were on point, and reviewed the job description, my résumé, and cover letter
    again. When we got on camera, the hiring manager said they had some disappointing
    news. They moved forward with another candidate. They were very impressed with
    my skill set and a generic email from HR seemed too impersonal, so they wanted
    to tell me personally and directly.

  zh: 我试图不过于情绪化地对待这个职位，但事实上，我真的非常非常想要这份工作。……最后，我收到了招聘经理发来的视频会议邀请。会议标题是“快速交流”，没有附加议程，安排在漫长一天的最后15分钟。由于我完全不知道会发生什么，我穿了整套西装，确保我的发型和妆容都完美无缺，再次查看了工作描述、我的简历和求职信。当我们打开摄像头时，招聘经理说他们有一些令人失望的消息。他们已经选择了另一位候选人。他们对我的技能组合印象深刻，而且来自人力资源的一封通用电子邮件似乎太不亲切了，所以他们想要亲自和直接地告诉我。
- en: I sat there semi-dumbfounded, in a full suit, feeling like an idiot with little
    to say. It felt extremely awkward. I had no room to emote in that moment and no

    to be told that I was a great candidate but they went with someone with more experience,
    and then the hiring manager offered to help with any connections that he could.
    While I appreciate his offer of connections, it still really really sucked to
    have to do this all over video call (and then the one connection fizzled out anyway).
    Plus, with an email I can always look back at it when I’m ready, while my mindset
    immediately after a rejection call is one of frustration and not useful.”

    feedback to please stop and think about what meetings need a Zoom call and what
    should be a phone call. I think a lot of people have gotten into the habit of
    making everything a Zoom meeting and they don’t stop to think. If this was a pre-COVID

    emailed me! It was a 30-minute call to tell me that I had been the second-best
    candidate but they went with one with ‘more recent experience,’ and that I ’should
    feel free to apply again if another opportunity opened up!’ I had to sit there
