    than zero. It would make sense to me that the answer is frequently zero dates,
    because you are not trying and aren’t ‘date ready’ in various senses. What’s super
    weird is that the vast majority did go on the one first date, but mostly they
    didn’t go on a second, and only half of those went on a third. It is as if people
    are capable of getting a date, then they go on one and recoil in ‘oh no not that
    again’ horror for about a year, then repeat the cycle? Or their friends set them
    up every year or so because it’s been too long, or something? None of that makes

    primary impact of attractiveness*.* Attractiveness has many other, bigger advantages,
    across all of life. Quality of attention increases, response to your attention
    improves dramatically, as does your ability to get things you want, and your negotiating
    leverage both in dating and relationships and in general. Lookism is a big deal.
    On the traditional 0-10 scale, people want to be 10s when you ask them, but as
    I understand it 10s actually get less attention than 8s because people are scared
    to approach someone too far out of their league. And of the attention the 10s
    do get, you are selecting heavily for people willing to approach and able to keep
    their heads on straight around a 10, which likely does not correlate with the
    people you actually want.

    profiles to get further information. It can let you ask questions of the profile
    and converse with it combined with all the question answers, and perhaps also
    input from previous swiping decisions. It can also train on the phase one swipes,
    and provide better candidate matches on the basis of looks on top of everything
    else. You can also have people talk to the AI or otherwise provide more information

    many distinct ways in which one is filtering out roughly half the population each
    time, usually starting with gender. Height is merely one filter among many, and
    we use the filter in large part because it is there. If we could filter by intelligence
    in a credible way, what percentage of people would ‘filter out half the population’
    by putting their IQ minimum at 100 or higher? Quite a lot, I am guessing. If we

    about you and your story. Thinking of partners in terms of how dating them reflects
    on your status (dream bf lists that go: tall, rich, impressive) and optimizing
    for your own impressiveness (get that promotion, take that travel photo). The
    inverse narcissism of incels (nothing I can do, no one will date a 5''7" man)
    is the same thing. What''s missing is the actual connection to the other person,
    thinking as a relationship and not as an individual.'

    Think about the values you embody together, whether your relationship will be
    about quality of time spent or about building a home and a family, the deep complementarities
    of how your strengths make up for the other's weak points as opposed to the superficial
    similarities of your taste in TV shows. Maybe make a spreadsheet, idk.

    to meet them? How do you maximize the serendipity of running into them? What sorts
    of people actually find you attractive, whose type are you? What do they actually
    like about you, and how do you show them you have what they need while filtering
    out everyone else?

    where each person is naturally and effortlessly modeling the other person and
    optimizing for their happiness as for your own. And the only way to get there
    is to become selfless before you know it's safe to do so, which opens you up to
    getting really hurt. Selfless dating comes from strength and resilience, which
    you can cultivate while still alone.

- en: The big piece of advice I am confident offering is that you should decide what
    you want out of such matters, and then form a plan and choose your actions accordingly.
    Ask where you want to end up, and backchain from that, which can include a simple
    need for reps and experience, and usually involves getting your own house in order.
    Deliberate practice in all things. Remember that avoiding what you don’t want
    and improving candidate match quality is good, even if it feels like rejection
    in the moment, and that being ok (or even ok-ish) with rejection is kind of a
    superpower. Do not expect that matters will take care of themselves, and do not
    give up all hope and do nothing (unless nothing is what you want), or accept for
    too long a situation or person that does not go where you want to ultimately go.
