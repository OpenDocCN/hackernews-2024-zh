    weird is that the vast majority did go on the one first date, but mostly they
    didn’t go on a second, and only half of those went on a third. It is as if people
    are capable of getting a date, then they go on one and recoil in ‘oh no not that
    again’ horror for about a year, then repeat the cycle? Or their friends set them

    improves dramatically, as does your ability to get things you want, and your negotiating
    leverage both in dating and relationships and in general. Lookism is a big deal.
    On the traditional 0-10 scale, people want to be 10s when you ask them, but as
    I understand it 10s actually get less attention than 8s because people are scared
    to approach someone too far out of their league. And of the attention the 10s
    do get, you are selecting heavily for people willing to approach and able to keep
    their heads on straight around a 10, which likely does not correlate with the
    people you actually want.

    0-10 分数表上，当你问他们时，人们希望自己是 10 分，但据我所知，10 分的人实际上比 8 分的人得到的注意力要少，因为人们害怕接近超出自己水平太远的人。而且，10
    分的人所吸引的注意力中，你选择的人很大程度上是愿意接近并能保持冷静面对一个 10 分的人的人，这可能与你真正想要的人不相符。

    we use the filter in large part because it is there. If we could filter by intelligence
    in a credible way, what percentage of people would ‘filter out half the population’
    by putting their IQ minimum at 100 or higher? Quite a lot, I am guessing. If we

    many have told me they've been helped by my writing about dating. How? By being
    exposed to a different orientation towards dating, the one that generated the
    advice. A big part is gaining compassion for the gender you're trying to date,
    understanding how dating is difficult and painful for them, that they self-sabotage
    more than they conspire to sabotage you. You start rooting for them.

    in your neighborhood. Today you have 100x as many options, which means 100x the
    reward but only if you do 100x the work, alone. But people haven't shifted to
    this mindset. Thinking of dating as strategic effort is cringe. The prevailing
    model is dating fatalism, whether it's belief in destined soulmates or simply
    giving up. Laziness and cowardice.

    about you and your story. Thinking of partners in terms of how dating them reflects
    on your status (dream bf lists that go: tall, rich, impressive) and optimizing
    for your own impressiveness (get that promotion, take that travel photo). The
    inverse narcissism of incels (nothing I can do, no one will date a 5''7" man)
    is the same thing. What''s missing is the actual connection to the other person,
    thinking as a relationship and not as an individual.'

    Think about the values you embody together, whether your relationship will be
    about quality of time spent or about building a home and a family, the deep complementarities
    of how your strengths make up for the other's weak points as opposed to the superficial
    similarities of your taste in TV shows. Maybe make a spreadsheet, idk.

    like about you, and how do you show them you have what they need while filtering
    out everyone else?

    where each person is naturally and effortlessly modeling the other person and
    optimizing for their happiness as for your own. And the only way to get there
    is to become selfless before you know it's safe to do so, which opens you up to
    getting really hurt. Selfless dating comes from strength and resilience, which
    you can cultivate while still alone.

- en: The big piece of advice I am confident offering is that you should decide what
    you want out of such matters, and then form a plan and choose your actions accordingly.
    Ask where you want to end up, and backchain from that, which can include a simple
    need for reps and experience, and usually involves getting your own house in order.
    Deliberate practice in all things. Remember that avoiding what you don’t want
    and improving candidate match quality is good, even if it feels like rejection
    in the moment, and that being ok (or even ok-ish) with rejection is kind of a
    superpower. Do not expect that matters will take care of themselves, and do not
    give up all hope and do nothing (unless nothing is what you want), or accept for
    too long a situation or person that does not go where you want to ultimately go.
