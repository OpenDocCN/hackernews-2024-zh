- en: Occasionally, you may see a reference in Windows to “hard errors”, such as in
    this article that shows [how to configure an unattended system so that it auto-answers
    hard error dialogs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/windows/win32/hard-error-popup-mode
    "How to change hard error popup handling in Windows"). But why is it called a
    “hard error”? Are there “easy errors”?

    system, below the user interface level. Windows can’t put up a traditional `MessageBox`
    because that pumps messages and allows application code to run at a time when
    the rules of co-operative multitasking say that application code should not be
    running.

- en: The code to display these special “hard system modal errors” was carefully written
    so as to rely only on parts of the user interface code that were re-entrant. In
    fact, the only user interface code it uses is processing mouse and keyboard input.
    All of the graphics are drawn by asking GDI to draw directly to the frame buffer,
    and all of the dialog behaviors are handwritten. No application code was allowed
    to run while this message was being shown to the user.

    was your regular `MessageBox`.

    name got repurposed to describe other types of critical error messages, usually
    low-level ones.
