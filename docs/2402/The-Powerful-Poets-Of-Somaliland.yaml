    trains and by women weaving mats to cover their domed huts. Like the lives of
    the nomadic people who spoke them, the poems were cyclical. When their speakers
    moved, they brought their animals and their poetry. At each stop along this annual
    migration, the women would reuse the verses as they built their thatched homes
    and the men would recite them as they moved their herds to water.

    would change Somaliland forever. That year, a poet named Maxamed Xaashi Dhamac,
    known as Gaarriye, published a poem called “No Refuge is Offered by Tribalism.”
    Somali society revolves around sprawling family trees that descend from five major
    clans, which trace their roots back to two brothers. These allegiances fuel politics
    and conflict. In the late 1970s, Barre’s government wanted to counter the power
    of these tribal connections; it commissioned a debate and asked Gaarriye to initiate
    it.

    of alliteration in the letter D. Some 50 poets would end up contributing their
    metered thoughts to the chain, which became known as *Deelley* — or, “The One
    in D.” Within six months, nearly 70 poems filled out the chain and the government
    had canceled its endorsement.

    the poets would understand the debate had ended. His plan failed, Ducaale says:
    One year later, the debate was still going. The next year, in 1982, the Somali
    National Movement was formed; it would become the main government opposition in
    the civil war fought at the end of the 1980s.'

    nation. After three brutal years of civil war, the dictatorship ended and Somaliland
    disentangled from Somalia to form its own government in 1991\. Poets gathered
    to help, settle the old rivalries and find a path toward peace. There were around

    he knows the debate was a reminder that politicians can’t overlook poetry. Poets
    have long been able to get away with criticism that others might not, but cloaking
    their opinions in verse hasn’t always protected them. Under Barre’s authoritarian
    rule, some poets were arrested and a few were killed. Others took government money
    to stay quiet or toe the party line.

    poets and journalists among them. It didn’t last long, or make a splash like Miimley,
