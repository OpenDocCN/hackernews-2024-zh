    — about $189 a year — are escorted to the front of TSA security lines by company
    “ambassadors” (as the people behind them in line grumble). Clear has rapidly grown
    to around 19 million members, and it plans to expand further into the hospitality,
    health care, financial services and online shopping industries.

    with a “skip the line” feature that prioritizes a dater’s profile. [Snowbird](https://www.snowbird.com/fast-tracks/)
    and other ski resorts, in a controversial change, allow visitors who pay extra
    to access expedited ski lifts. In December, Killington introduced a “Four-Day
    Fast Track” for $199 on top of its daily regular fee of about $165, and it sometimes
    sells out. Universal Studios theme park offers an unlimited “Express Pass” starting
    at $109.99 per person — on top of the admission price — which allows holders to
    skip the line right on the spot.

    much they spend, and some customers have always found hidden and informal ways
    to jump a line — slipping the restaurant host some cash, for example. But it’s

    many more runs in a day. The wealthier kids whose parents pay for the “Lightning
    Line” at the Slinky Dog Dash roller coaster at Disney World can pop on and move

    cutting for rich people,” and 13,000 people signed a [petition](https://www.change.org/p/force-mt-bachelor-and-pwdr-corp-to-cease-and-desist-fast-passes)
    calling on them to abandon the expedited lanes (they didn’t). Sen. Ron Wyden of
    Oregon complained about Mt. Bachelor’s pass, saying it would “exacerbate equity
    issues” and create a “two-tiered system of access to public lands based on financial

    improve service for everybody else, Allon said. But that’s rarely the case. By
    removing the wealthiest or highest-paying customers from a line, there’s little
    incentive to advocate for better service for the rest.
