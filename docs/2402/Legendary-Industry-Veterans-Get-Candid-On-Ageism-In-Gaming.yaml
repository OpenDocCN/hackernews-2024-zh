    within the last few years, from [allegations that a culture of sexual harassment](https://kotaku.com/everything-that-has-happened-since-the-activision-blizz-1847401161)
    was allowed to thrive to [reports of union-busting by management](https://kotaku.com/workers-accuse-activision-blizzard-of-union-busting-1847675870).
    But in January 2024, when a [new lawsuit was filed](https://www.polygon.com/24029908/activision-blizzard-old-white-age-discrimiantion-lawsuit)
    against the *Call of Duty* and *Overwatch* publisher, many were shocked to read
    what it was in reference to: A 57-year-old former ActiBlizz exec alleged that
    he left the company because of ageism. According to the lawsuit, then-CEO Bobby
    Kotick said that the company’s problem was that there were “too many old white
    guys” working there.'

    diverse game industry—one where whiteness and maleness remain the norm—age discrimination
    is a hot-button issue as well. According to a [2019 survey from the International
    Game Developers Association](https://www.statista.com/statistics/453780/game-developer-age-distribution-worldwide/),
    only 9% of game developers are 50 years old or older. As the people behind iconic,
    genre-defining games approach and surpass middle age, how do their peers treat
    them? Have they noticed a shift in the way developers work, or how games are made?

    Nightdive Studios head of business development Larry Kuperman on another, to chat
    about navigating the game world after spending decades in it.

    stuff or on the business side,” Spector, who is 68, proclaims early on in the
    conversation. He’s referencing the phenomenon by which former developers transition
    to the business side of game dev, which many chalk up to the intense demands of
    video game development cycles.

    Miller (who pioneered gaming’s episodic release format) shipped his first in ‘85,
    Kuperman has been involved in games since 2001, and Bleszinski joined Epic Games
    in ‘92\. Of the four, Spector is the only one solely working on the development
    side, while the rest are now mostly focused on the business end or, in Bleszinski’s
    case, out of games almost entirely.

    are why companies can’t or won’t retain older talent. “Some people find an ever-changing
    environment invigorating,” Spector suggests. “That’s one of the reasons I’ve lasted
    this long…things change so rapidly that you’re constantly acquiring not only new
    knowledge but new skills.”

    difficulty of the work, the low pay, drives even young developers away,” he points
    out while suggesting that, in his experience, the average “lifespan” of a programmer
    is about five to seven years due to the intense nature of their work.

    that lives for that [intense] work ethic,” Bleszinski says during our conversation.
    “And then there’s a certain amount of peer pressure where you have deadlines and
    then someone goes home at six o’clock at night to their family, and then the other
    people are still at their desks—they don’t say it, but deep down they’re thinking,
    ‘I’m gonna be here until midnight, fuck that guy.’ A lot of that comes from the
    top…my producer on *Gears*, Rod Ferguson, I believe is one of the best in the
    business, but he lives for the work. He’s just an absolute workaholic.”

    you get to a certain age where you hit the point where you’re like, ‘fuck you,
    pay me’.”

    business model), they wholeheartedly agree on one thing: The nuts and bolts of

    that game was made by one guy. We helped him up with the music and voiceover,

    at indie studios. “I like being at the indie level,” Miller says. “I think we

    on at the indie level that you’re not seeing at the big boy level because it’s
    too costly to take a risk,” Miller suggests.

    just apprehension towards those leading it: “It sounds like [companies] just over-hired
    during the early days of the pandemic, and it’s bad management that’s resulting
    in overstaffing. That doesn’t mean there’s a fundamental flaw. It means we have
    some bad managers at the top of companies.”'

    than normal” during covid, and studios went on a hiring spree.

    meantime, there are lots of indie developers that are not only thriving, but are

    manager, he was let go at 57 years old. “There I was, with a great resume, you
    know, successful in games, I had worked with every major company, my client list
    went from Activision to Zenimax…I sent out my resume, my applications to all of
    these companies that I had worked with—they all knew what I could do and my capabilities.
    And they all turned me down,” Kuperman recalls. “And the one that was the most
    offensive—I won’t say who it was—but they took the time to explain to me that
    I was not a ‘cultural fit.’ I got this explanation that I was not a cultural fit
    while I was working from home wearing a Ramones T-shirt. I knew what they meant,
    right? That I was not gonna fit in with their twenty- and thirty-somethings.”

    they didn’t get “fuck you” money or because they genuinely love what they do—from
    our convo, it’s clear that his time churning out AAA games left him somewhat jaded.
    “Talking about ageism—once a person gets married and has kids and whatnot, you
    know, they’re going to put in their eight hours and they’re gonna go the fuck
    home,” Bleszinski says. “I tell people, get ‘fuck you’ money, and then get the

    is vastly different from Bleszinski’s, who had to be the face of a massive AAA
    franchise while still actively working on it. But all of them still agree that
    game development can often feel like a young person’s, well, game. Part of that
    has to do with the demands of the work, sure, but there’s an accessibility problem,
    as well.

    don’t believe me that there are physical changes in your body as you get older.

    to. I am physically not able to keep up with 12-year-olds, 34-year-olds [referencing
    my age] playing games anymore. So I need to find a somewhat different role in
    development, and I’m lucky enough that I’ve been able to carve out a different
    role. But a lot of people might just say, ‘I don’t want to do that anymore’ and
    self-select out.”

    foxhole. Younger developers don’t wanna do that, and it’s a good thing ‘cause
