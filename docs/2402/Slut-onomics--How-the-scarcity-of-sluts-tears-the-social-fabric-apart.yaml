    to be one of the world's foremost experts on sexual inactivity.

    claim that 20 percent of all men get 80 percent of all female partners, Peter
    Ueda doesn''t just claim it is impossible like so many others. Instead, he cited
    estimates of a plausible number: A given year, in the age range of 18 to 29, 20
    percent of all men have 66 percent of all female sexual partners. Meanwhile, 20
    percent of all women have 57 percent of all sexual partners.'

    20 percent of men and 10 percent of women had more than three sexual partners
    during the same year.

    average more than three sexual partners per year. But those sexual partners seem
    to disproportionately belong to one category: Unusually promiscuous women. Although
    the numbers indicate that sexual partners are more evenly shared among women than
    among men, there is definitely no complete “equality” on the female side either.
    Especially, there should be less than ten percent of women with unusually many
    sexual partners who are pulling the female average upwards.'

    market, when that market mostly consists of a somewhat similar small subset of
    women. A minority of men and a minority of women are having fun (?) with each
    other while most people of both sexes are either living in traditional couples
    or standing beside the whole spectacle without even participating.

    than otherwise. The men who are skilled at picking up women do not pick up every
    random woman they happen to fancy. Instead, they most likely succeed with a minority
    of women, the same minority which their colleagues have already picked up. The
    successful men are actually not making the market much bigger. Instead, they are
    competing between themselves for the minority of women who are willing to be impressed
    by men trying to impress them. Let the best men win.

    very much about: Intra-male jealousy. Among the incels Peter Ueda wrote about,
    more than one had a very strong sense of not tolerating the thought of others
    having sex. Theoretically, I knew those feelings existed. I have even [made up
    a theory](https://woodfromeden.substack.com/p/a-rational-view-of-female-modesty)
    why sexuality is a taboo in all human societies: Among males of many different
    species, getting provoked by others having sex is adaptive. For example, among
    chimpanzees, the alpha male tends to be very jealous and does not tolerate that
    other males copulate with fertile females. Presumably he just detests the sight,
    and even the thought, of other people having sex. It is likely that we have inherited
    the tendency to feel disgusted by other individuals having sex from our pre-human
    ancestors.'

    this day. A minority of young men and women participate in a game that many more
    men than women would like to enter. It is like a minority of the population is
    on show, making the most of the liberal ideals, while the others are lingering
    in the shadows.

    has always been very unequal among men. Even in modern society, where casual sex
    is encouraged as liberating for women, only a minority heeds the calls for promiscuity.
    Imagine then how few women there were on the casual sex market when no one told
    young women that having casual sex was a good choice.

    hundred year old books, they tell about quick sexual encounters between teenage
    girls and boys. For a certain minority of women, taking the casual track has always
    seemed appealing, for shorter or longer times. Very strong male demand causes
    ample opportunities. A few women will take those opportunities, for reasons better
    or worse. But only a few.

    them, so few can get them. Today, the inequality is glaring. Many men, maybe a
    majority of young men, would like to have a share in that willing minority of
    women. Only a minority of those men get that privilege. Those men are considered
    successful while those who can't get any access to the willing minority of women
    are considered losers, by themselves and others.

    between men. Why is this bitterness bubbling up with such force now?

    and more people are living as celibate singles. Singles who would have preferred
    to engage in casual sex. But I think there is another reason too: For the first
    time in the history of civilization, the willing minority of women is being widely
    described as unambiguously desirable.'

    called slutshaming. It implied that the minority of women who engaged in casual
    sex were morally depraved. And since these women were morally depraved it also
    implied that they were not that desirable after all. They were not called *Stacies*
    or *10/10s* but sluts or simply loose women. Men still chased them, of course,
    but being a man who chased loose women was not a very honorable thing to be.

    desirable by the promiscuous minority of women and the majority of men rejected
    by the same women. The successful men didn''t really say: "Hey look, I can get
    something you can’t". Instead they admitted: "I amuse myself with sluts, but just
    like you I most of all want a proper woman.”'

    success: After all, the women they seduced were "cheap". Not that much of an achievement
    after all.'

    or actually think, that they didn't want to spend time with dishonorable women.
    The successful men could help them by understating their own conquests. Access
    to casual sex was as unequal as ever. But by talking down the value of the women
    offering casual sex, strife among men could be reduced.

    to exist. A strong male wish to monopolize their partners is also at play. And
    Women themselves have a strong incentive to punish women who sell themselves too
    cheaply, in order not to deflate the value of the sexual services they provide.

    because unchaste women offer less paternity certainty. Two studies from 1981 and
    1983 suggest that the number of premarital partners does predict the risk of infidelity.
    It is a difficult subject, not least because both premarital sex and infidelity
    are very much affected by culture. I see one reason to assume that the number
    of premarital sexual partners is not a very good proxy for a woman''s outlooks
    to become a faithful wife: Psychologist David Buss argues that women who have
    affairs tend to do so for strategic rather than emotional reasons. According to
    Buss, men who have affairs tend to be driven by a wish for sexual variety: they
    report no lower levels of marital satisfaction than men who do not have affairs.
    Women, on the other hand, tend to pursue affairs as a way to more or less deliberately
    scout for better relationship opportunities.'

    when they are considering a marriage partner: A man with a strong taste for sexual
    variety is more likely to initiate affairs, while a woman with a taste in the
    same direction is likely to remain faithful until she is feeling unhappy enough
    to switch partners.'

    is a risky strategy. An individual man who does so risks missing out on a good
    opportunity. The merits of slutshaming probably lie as much on the collective
    level as on the individual level: For women as a collective to defend their price.
    For men as a collective to keep peace between each other.'

    slutshaming, there were two kinds of women: Good ones and bad ones. Post-slutshaming
    there is only one kind of woman, graded on a scale from one to ten in physical
    and social attractiveness. Competition for the tens is bitter.'

    long as there were sluts and proper women, “I'm not that kind of girl” was a perfectly
    normal excuse to reject someone's sexual advances. Now that there is only one
    kind of girl, the rejection is ominously personal.

    undifferentiated mass of providers of sexual and reproductive services, and are
    graded from one to ten for their efforts. But every time they *do not* want each
    other, it is suspected to be for naked, personal reasons. Saying “it''s not you”
    is much easier when there is a system for who-should-reject-whom-at-what-occasion.
