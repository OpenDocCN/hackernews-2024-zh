    We start with normal arithmetic. Multiplying by a positive didn't flip the sign,
    so we say we rotated by $ 0^\circ $. Multiplying by a negative flips the sign,
    so we rotated by $ \class{green}{180^\circ} $. The lengths are multiplied normally
    in both cases.

    (*1.5 at 90 degrees*). It could make sense to say that multiplying by this number
    should rotate by $ \class{green}{90^\circ} $ while again growing the length by
    50%.

    fabric of the complex plane that's warping. Each circle has been squeezed into
    a half-circle, because all the angles have been halved—the opposite of squaring,
    i.e. doubling the angle. The lengths have had a normal square root applied to
    them, compressing the grid at the edges and bulging it in the middle.

    the circular nature of complex math. If we take a vector and rotate it $ 360 ^\circ
    $, we end up in the same place, and the two vectors are equal. But after dividing
    the angles in half, those two vectors are now separated by only $ 180 ^\circ $
    and lie on opposite ends of the circle. In complex math, they can both emerge.

    'far side' as we try and shear the disc apart. The complex plane is stubborn and

    case. This is one of its most remarkable properties.

    fourth power, angles are multiplied by four, while lengths are taken to the fourth
    power. This results in 4 copies of the plane being folded into one.

    to an irrational power, say $ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} $? Angles get multiplied by $
