- en: Flock, a startup which promotes a [surveillance state](https://jalopnik.com/florida-is-tracking-drivers-through-a-secret-surveillan-1849507667),
    has installed car tracking cameras in 4,000 cities among 42 states. The company
    makes its money and shareholder value by delivering [AI-based tracking hardware
    and software](https://jalopnik.com/cops-are-already-treating-self-driving-cars-as-surveill-1850595009)
    to [local police departments](https://jalopnik.com/people-are-still-dying-on-american-streets-and-we-dont-1850862638),
    which are more than happy to pay Flock’s $3,000 annual fee. The Atlanta-based
    company [has grown nearly 2,700 percent since 2020](https://www.flocksafety.com/articles/flock-safety-ranked-number-58-on-2023-deloitte-technology-fast-500),
    and at least some of that growth, [according to a new report from Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/thomasbrewster/2024/02/27/flock-safety-surveillance-broke-state-law/?sh=2c7213cc2a8f),
    has come from a willingness to bend the rules to get their cameras installed and
    tracking your every movement.

- en: Flock uses fallible artificial intelligence software to “fingerprint” a car,
    matching its make, model, and appearance to a license plate number in the DOT
    database. Cops love Flock because they say it is less expensive than competitive
    systems from Motorola, while allegedly providing more accurate tracking of potential
    suspects.

    Flock is willing to commit in order to help law enforcement catch alleged criminals.
    According to company correspondence reviewed by *Forbes*, Flock has failed to
    obtain correct permitting for hundreds of its camera installations. Installing
    “devices” on state infrastructure without prior DOT approval is a crime in Florida,
    Illinois, and South Carolina, and the company has also run into issues with Texas
    and Washington over its lack of permits.'

    that since spring 2022, her staff has found more than 200 unpermitted Flock cameras
    during routine monitoring of public roads. In July 2023, the agency put a moratorium
    on new installations and ordered a safety and compliance review of all Flock cameras
    across the state.

    is keeping it. All of that infringes on our personal freedom without our knowledge.
    It’s getting to the point where a company is willing to break the law to install
    these cameras.”

    now “cover almost 70 percent of the population” and are used to solve “about 2,200
    crimes a day.” Just one Flock contract, Riverside County, California’s, consists
    of a network of 309 cameras scanning 27.5 million cars per month.

    told the company it had many repeated, error-filled permit applications for camera
    installations. A Flock representative gave the IDOT official a thinly-veiled threat
    that if they didn’t fast-track the process, Flock would send “about 30 different
    police chiefs” to their office to talk to them about it.
