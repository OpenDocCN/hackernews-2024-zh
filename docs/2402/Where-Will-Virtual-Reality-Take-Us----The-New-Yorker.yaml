    are newness junkies, it can feel like an act of sabotage to have memories, but,
    for better or worse, I have them. It’s been more than forty years since I co-founded
    the first company to make headsets and software for simulated experiences, and
    came up with familiar terms like virtual and mixed reality. Since then, [virtual
    reality](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/virtual-reality) has flooded the public
    imagination in waves; back in the nineteen-eighties, for instance, it had quite
    a presence in movies, cartoons, TV shows, the occasional arcade game, and a few
    early consumer products, like the Nintendo Power Glove. I still love V.R. But,
    these days, I sense that what I experience of it, what I enjoy in it, is different
    from what it has come to mean to many enthusiasts.

    with now? Sometimes I did! I did occasionally promote V.R. as an alternate cosmos
    that might swallow us all to good effect. I don’t agree with that sort of talk
    now, but at the time the joy of being edgy and extreme was too great to resist.
    Every young technical person wants to see around the corners that others cannot,
    to be the harbinger of great change. To explain to someone in the early eighties
    what V.R. was—to give them a demo—was an ego rush, because they often couldn’t
    grasp what was being said or what had just happened to them. It was a primal validation,
    a power trip, and I wish I had done it with more humility. But here we are, after
    almost a half century of products, movies, and startups, and V.R. people still
    seek that rush. Apple’s promotional videos for its new headset—the Vision Pro,
    a metal-and-glass, ski-goggle-like apparatus that costs around thirty-five hundred
    dollars—show people experiencing V.R. for the first time. The producers either
    had to search hard for those people or ask actors to pretend.

    so much influence on computers and phones. Back in 1984, when the Macintosh was
    introduced, a few members of the Mac team left Apple to join my startup, V.P.L.,
    and help us create the first generation of commercial V.R. products. At the time,
    we guessed that Apple itself would enter the market in 2010\. We knew that the
    consumer adoption of the technology was a long way off. We were selling tools
    for millions of dollars to customers like *NASA*. But despite the conservative
    clients, our early V.R. software was radically strange. You could program while
    in our virtual world, and see all the variables not as textual symbols but as
    virtual objects; there was no source code. I used to wax on about how virtual
    reality would lead to a new style of “post-symbolic” communication, in which we
    would make experiences for one another, sharing them directly instead of just
    describing them.

    “killer apps.” It has long been an established industrial technology: if you’ve
    flown, ridden, or sailed in a factory-built vehicle in the last thirty years,
    virtual reality may have played a central role. It’s been used to design surgical
    procedures and train surgeons ever since our first simulated gallbladder, at Stanford
    Med, some three decades ago; Boeing, Ford, and many other companies started using
    VR for design in the early days as well. And then there are the visionary, mystical,
    and philosophical applications. V.R. can be a way of exploring the nature of consciousness,
    relationships, bodies, and, perception. In other words, it can be art. V.R. is
    most fun when approached that way.'

    life? The question has lingered for generations, and is still open. Gaming seems
    likely—but, for most gamers, not so much. There are many reasons why V.R. and
    gaming don’t quite work, and I suspect that one is that gamers like to be bigger
    than the game, not engulfed by it. You want to feel big, not small, when you play.
    (“Star Wars” might have got this right with holographic chess.) Apple’s initial
    round of Vision Pro apps, like those from its competitors, aren’t entirely compelling,
    either, and can even have a lonely, dystopian flavor. (Watching a simulated big-screen
    movie, by yourself?) But my belief is that the quotidian killer apps will come.

- en: Virtual-reality headsets come in various forms. A major divide has to do with
    how they acknowledge the real world. Some headsets obscure the surrounding environment
    completely; this is typical in gaming headsets. But there is another option, which
    I used to call “mixed” reality, and which came to be known as “augmented” reality
    in the nineteen-nineties. Some mixed or augmented headsets, such as the Microsoft
    HoloLens or the system created by Magic Leap, allow you to see the real world
    through the headset glass so that it can be combined with virtual content using
    challenging optical techniques. Others, like Apple’s Vision Pro and [the recent
    offerings from Meta](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/infinite-scroll/we-already-live-in-facebooks-metaverse),
    capture the real world with cameras, then render it as part of the virtual environment
    so that it can be combined with fabulated content.

    but it is concerning. Early research by a Stanford-led team has found evidence
    of cognitive challenges. Your hands are never quite in the right relationship
    with your eyes, for instance. Given what is going on with deepfakes out on the
    2-D Internet, we also need to start worrying about deception and abuse, because
    reality can be so easily altered as it’s virtualized.

    gravitates toward alarming content that activates primal fight-or-flight responses.
    Fortunately, Apple is one of the companies that doesn’t rely on that model. Nonetheless,
    experiences will come from all kinds of companies, and V.R. could agitate and
    depress people even more than the little screens on smartphones.

    that people are cattle, and not free-range ones. This is a good reason for wanting
    virtual reality to be an environment in which users actively create their own
    content, rather than passively experiencing what big companies have built for
    them. For most of the technology’s history, however, virtual experiences have
    been hard to build and maintain. This has been one of V.R.’s biggest problems.
    I saw the first V.R. teaching demonstration of general relativity at least as
    early as 1992, and have seen dozens more since then; they’re often wonderful,
    and help users grasp the concept in new ways. But they only run for a year or
    so because there are too many variables in a V.R. system for creators to keep
    experiences available. Graphics chips change, and with them the layers of mediating
    software. That’s true for other programs, too, but with V.R., when the properties
    of a headset (like field of view) or an input device shift, the whole experience
    and interaction method must often be rejiggered. It’s too much ongoing effort,
    so it usually doesn’t happen; developers move on to other projects. The exceptions
    have been locked-down V.R. experiences that assume a minimal level of interaction,
    which limits the magic.

    activity on your part: the virtual world only starts to feel real when you move
    your head; it’s when your surroundings compensate for that motion that they appear
    to exist outside of you. And yet we often see V.R. depicted as a funnel that dumps
    spectacular experiences into the brain of the user.'

    into big masks from different cultures, sometimes adding lightning bolts and feathers.
    I wanted the headsets to be vibrant, exciting objects that enriched the real world,
    too. Apple’s device shows the eyes of the wearer, by means of screens on the front,
    and this creates the illusion that the headset is transparent. But in past decades
    we used similar screens to show those in the real world the face of the virtual
    avatar that the wearer was inhabiting: a viking, an octopus, an abstract geometric
    construction. You wouldn’t want to disguise a motorcycle as a bicycle. If you’re

    to surgical simulation and vehicle design, the technology is used by oil companies
    to simulate geological structures, by drug companies to envision molecules, and
    by planners working on city centers. The new frontier, which might apply more
    to everyday life, is the spontaneous creation of practical apps that you might
    not even bother to save. My research group, for instance, has presented a prototype
    system—the “mixed-reality copilot”—that allowed us to recreate, with a single
    voice request, a program that allows you to use your hands to paint and sculpt
    with virtual stuff. A decade ago, it took months to make that kind of program.
    Hopefully, in the near future, one will be able to ask for a V.R. relativity simulation
    tailored for a student who has color blindness and A.D.H.D., and it will simply
    appear. More prosaically, you might walk through a facility in augmented reality,
    asking an A.I. for instant advice about potential safety hazards and fixes. These
    ideas might even work already: one of the curious features of this accelerated
    period of A.I. development is that there aren’t enough minutes in the day to try

    body. The brain has had to adapt to many body plans over the course of its evolution,
    and it’s pre-adapted to work with more. When you change your body, you can also
    play with the flow of time. By shifting the rhythm of the natural sway of your
    limbs, and also how the objects around you move and change in response, you alter
    the reference points that your brain uses to mark the flow of time. You can speed
    it up or slow it down. In V.R., you can change the rules of the world. You can
    exist in strange geometries that are too hard to describe in words. You can become
    an archipelago of parts instead of a continuous animal. You can blend and share
    bodies with others, to a surprising degree.

    sometimes suggest that their models have it. This can make us wonder if it’s even

    to judge technology without a sense of its purpose—and its only plausible purpose
    is to benefit people, or perhaps animals, or the over-all ecosystem of the planet.
    In any case, if we pursue technologies that make it hard to delineate the beneficiaries—for
    instance, by blending brains into robotics not to cure a disease but just because
    it seems cool—then we make the very idea of technology absurd. The central question
    of the technological future is how to identify the people who are supposed to
    benefit from technology, especially if they seem to have melted into it. If people
    aren’t special, how can we act in a way that benefits people? We can’t. The principles
    of ethics, design, and even technology itself become nonsense. What can that specialness
    be? It must be something that is not technologically accessible, since technology
    expands unpredictably. It’s a little mystical. The definition of people must be
    one of apartness. We must now put people on pedestals, or they will drown.

    to try to sneak flowers or pretty crystals in front of people before they would
