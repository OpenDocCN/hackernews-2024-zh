    owners saying they’re [returning their $3,500 headsets](https://www.threads.net/@samhenrigold/post/C3Seod9Omm8)
    in the past few days. Apple allows you to return any product within 14 days of
    purchase — and for the first wave of Vision Pro buyers, we’re right about at that
    point.

- en: Comfort is among the most cited reasons for returns. People have said the headset
    gives them headaches and [triggers motion sickness](https://x.com/adampreiser/status/1755642955703218656?s=20).
    The [weight of the device](https://x.com/schmanke/status/1757264358705389969?s=20),
    and the fact that most of it is front-loaded, has been another complaint. Parker
    Ortolani, *The Verge*’s product manager, told me that he thought using the device
    led to [a burst blood vessel](https://www.threads.net/@parkerortolani/post/C3MBcxns4dO)
    in his eye. At least one other person noted [they had a similar experience with
    redness](https://www.threads.net/@matthewcassinelli/post/C3VS8ieLPG5/?igshid=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==).
    (To be fair, VR headset users have [anecdotally reported dry eyes and redness](https://www.reddit.com/r/OculusQuest/comments/djdobl/hemorrhage_eyes_after_long_use/)
    for years.)

    to wear even for short periods of time both due to the weight and the strap designs.
    I wanted to use it, but dreaded putting it on,” says Ortolani, who also [posted](https://www.threads.net/@parkerortolani/post/C3Qw78lPmLD)
    about returning the device.

    scaling wearable production for the mass market. Comfort is inevitably sacrificed
    — and it affects people disproportionately. With smartwatches, it often boils
    down to the size and weight of the case compared to your wrist. With smart rings,
    it’s the size of your finger. Many people are unfortunately between sizes or have
    issues with finger swelling. For smart glasses and headsets, having a low nose
    bridge can mean the device just slips off your face or fails to adequately block
    out light.

- en: But the hardware isn’t the only issue. Another common complaint is the Vision
    Pro doesn’t offer enough productivity relative to the price. One user noted on
    [Threads](https://www.threads.net/@oliarism/post/C3S8XW0xIE8) that looking at
    Figma screens made them feel dizzy but that the device also wasn’t applicable
    to their work. [Another engineer wrote](https://x.com/GuiBibeau/status/1754714914197815764?s=20)
    on the social media platform X that the “coding experience failed to convince
    [him]” and focusing issues caused headaches.

    file management are productivity deal-breakers.

    on [Threads](https://www.threads.net/@prcgibson/post/C3VwSK5ydsS). “Several file
    types simply aren’t supported on the Vision Pro.I also can’t see how creating
    a slide in the VP would be less energy than doing so w/ mouse and keyboard — even
    if does feel like you’re in *Minority Report*.”

    Pro 不支持几种文件类型。我也看不出在 VP 中创建幻灯片比用鼠标和键盘更节省能量 —— 即使感觉上就像你身处*少数派报告*。”
- en: It’s hard to say how this vocal subset of early adopters will impact the Vision
    Pro going forward. Many folks who said they’d be returning the device also noted
    they’d be eager to try a second-gen Vision Pro. Others emphasized that the tech
    wasn’t the issue at hand so much as the lack of a killer app or comfort. It’s
    also hard to say how widespread of a phenomenon this is. While these users are
    speaking out on social media, we have no idea of the actual return rate — or what
    Apple’s internal expectations for the Vision Pro are.

  zh: 现在很难说这些早期采用者中的这一小部分会对 Vision Pro 的未来产生什么影响。许多表示会退货的人也注意到他们很愿意尝试第二代 Vision Pro。其他人强调，技术并不是问题，而是缺乏杀手级应用程序或舒适性。现在也很难说这是多么普遍的现象。虽然这些用户在社交媒体上发声，但我们不知道实际的退货率
    —— 或者苹果对 Vision Pro 的内部预期。
