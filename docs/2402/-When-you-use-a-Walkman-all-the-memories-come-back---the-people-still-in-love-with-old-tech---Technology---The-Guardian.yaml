- en: In 1989, jewellery maker Tiffany & Co and electronics company Sony released
    a silver-plated Walkman (complete with a fitted wooden box) to celebrate 10 years
    of the portable cassette player. Only 250 were made. Several decades on, and long
    since the cassette Walkman began its slide into obsolescence – outpaced first
    by the cumbersome Discman and the vibe-less MiniDisc player, then lapped by the
    iPod and iPhone – you can still find some of these items selling in auctions for
    hundreds and sometimes thousands of pounds.

    Walkman, for example, is a popular item among collectors. The [WM-F5 from 1983
    was the first](https://walkmancentral.com/products/wm-f5) designed to be “splash-proof”
    and came with a built-in FM radio. The sharp colour and weather-proofing led to
    sales soaring, Walkman collector Mark Ip tells me. “I have many of them,” he adds.

    he focuses his vast collection on pristine Walkmans housed in their original packaging
    – though he also has several hundred unboxed ones, too. He bills himself as “cassette
    Walkman collector on a mission to bring back the long-lost memories of the past”.

    The rest are in storage – they have to be kept dry, otherwise Hong Kong’s humid
    climate will damage the boxes. “I don’t know exactly how many boxes are in my
    warehouse. When I die, I’ll leave it to my son maybe,” Ip adds, though he says
    his son cares more about modern Apple products.

    afford it at the time (originally the cost was about [$150](https://www.fabcollectibles.com/audio/cassette/sony-tps-l2.html)).

    in ageing tech, including boomboxes, component audio systems, old analogue and
    2G mobile phones and pagers. There is also a big local trade in old camera lenses,
    Ip says, from manufacturers such as Leica and Zeiss. Ip buys and swaps with others
    to fill gaps in his Walkman collection, while also finding some further afield,
    in the US and Europe. “Like all collectors, you are seeking perfection,” he says.
    “What is perfect is a new box, never touched, no scratches, no dust. It’s almost
    impossible, but I will do my best to patiently wait.”

    its 2000s imperial era. “Things aren’t always completely utopian,” says Julia
    Topp, another curator at the museum. “Everything is recurring.”'

    now goes for high sums. Some of the museum’s early collection was amassed from
    the streets: in the 70s younger people were throwing out older wooden items in
    favour of new plastic things, so the museum picked them up. A similar cycle occurred
    in the early 90s with the fall of the communist world – East Germans got rid of
    GDR-issued furniture to grab sought-after western products. But furniture from
    the east was designed to be long-lasting and is now highly desired. A 1960s sideboard
    desk from the Dresden furniture manufacturer Deutsche Werkstätten Hellerau can
    sell on Facebook Marketplace now for €230.'

    or collect things are remembering their childhood? I think it’s the same, only
    maybe with longer periods of repeats, as with clothes; so the 90s are back, of
    course, and the Y2K style from 2000 is coming back.”

    Voo Store, both providing, as Renz says, a neat summation of “how consumption
    works”. In among its expensive clothes and blocky Asics and Salomon trainers is
    a row of 90s-inspired [Oakley sunglasses](https://www.vooberlin.com/oakley/).
    Few would have predicted their eventual revival – from staples of 90s basketball
    stars, and on through cycles of golfers and tech bros, finally taking their place
    as prized signifiers of contemporary cool, selling in Berlin’s trendy Kreuzberg
    district for more than €200\. “You can bring it back,” jokes Topp, “*and* make
    it more expensive.”

    doors last November, after [its lease](https://www.museumderdinge.org/appeal-donations-kitchen-must-come-along)
    was terminated “by an anonymous real estate fund”. It is due to reopen in another
    location in the city later this year. In the meantime, all 40,000 of its objects
    have to be packed up, stored and moved.

    in Manchester, either boosterish or plaintive, depending on your mood. The shop
    is based in the Afflecks indoor market in the city’s Northern Quarter. Though
    small, it has upgraded in size twice since opening in 2019\. Mars Tapes was started
    by the couple Borja Regueira and Moira Lorenzo, and soon afterwards Alex Tadros
    and Giorgio Carbone, who run Sour Grapes, came on board.

    down at car boot sales and through people coming in to sell old stashes. Prices
    range from Devo’s 1978 debut ([£65](https://www.discogs.com/sell/item/2504409830))
    to [Michael Bolton’s The Hunger (£3)](https://www.discogs.com/sell/item/1237939386).
    They also sell new stuff from their own label, and imprints further up the food
    chain, too. “More bands are willing to release on cassette these days,” says Regueira.
    “Before, we were telling bands, ‘We’re going to release you on cassette’, and
    some were like, ‘Eh, cassette, what?’ But now everyone is more familiar with it.”
    Tadros chimes in: “You have huge global artists doing it now … Adele and Lady
    Gaga.”'

    we chat to artists who print cassettes through us,” says Tadros, “it tends to
    be due to them being disillusioned by streaming and the difficulty of standing
    out in such a deep audience. Whereas, having a small batch of tapes can connect
    to a tight-knit group of people who enjoy similar music and would buy directly
    from them at a gig or through [Bandcamp](https://bandcamp.com/). Profits from
    selling a cassette range from £4-10 depending on the batch quantity.”

    other physical formats. “Vinyl is the gold standard for physical music in people’s
    eyes, and understandably so,” says Tadros. “But in terms of bands and the DIY
    communities accessing it, vinyl – especially these last couple of years – takes
    for ever to print, so you can wait months and months to release an album, and
    it costs three/four/five times the amount of a cassette run.”

    in Taiwan, and selling for £35, which offers people with a burgeoning interest
    a cheap way to try it without much commitment. They say they are selling at least
    one a day at the moment. Though the quality of cheaper players made today isn’t
    as high as Sony originals, getting vintage Walkmans in good condition can prove
    difficult and costly. But that won’t stop the analogue diehards from trying, convinced
    that an elusive classic might always be lurking somewhere.
