  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A Planito year consists of approximately 245 working days, with each day having
    6.5 working hours. This totals about 1,593 hours per year, which is around 20%
    less than what is typically worked in a traditional week model, not accounting
    for vacation time.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Vacation time in Planito is managed similarly to traditional models but adjusted
    for the shorter working hours. For example, if you have four weeks of paid vacation
    in a traditional model (160 hours), in Planito, this would be reduced by 20% to
    128 hours, still equating to 20 days of vacation.

    which gives a holiday-like experience, offering a break and a chance to focus
    on personal priorities.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Planito is built on the idea that shorter working hours lead to less burnout,
    fewer sick days, happier employees, and, as a result, increased productivity and
    efficiency. This model relies on evidence that supports these outcomes.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Some 4-day workweek models compress the same amount of work hours into fewer
    days, which can be counterproductive. Planito differs by reducing the total number
    of work hours per day, promoting a more sustainable approach to work and focus.

- en: Scientific research supports the idea that an individual can maintain concentrated
    work for a maximum of 6 hours per day, further validating Planito's approach to
    shorter, more effective work periods compared to the traditional or modified 4-day
    workweek models.

    and family?
  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: With Planito's 6.5-hour workday, starting your day at 8:00 AM means you would
    finish by 2:30 PM. This schedule often allows ample time in the afternoon and
    evening to spend with loved ones, even on workdays.

- en: Importantly, about one third of all Planito weekend days (or roughly 35 days
    per year) align with traditional weekend days, offering additional opportunities
    to spend time with friends and family who follow a conventional schedule.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Planito weekends offer unique opportunities to enjoy activities without the
    usual crowds, like empty ski slopes or shorter lines at attractions. While it
    may affect social plans with friends who work traditional hours, it also opens
    up new possibilities for personal time and errands.

- en: A Planito week always overlaps with traditional work weeks on several days,
    ensuring ample opportunity for collaboration and communication. This design considers
    the need to stay connected while also protecting deep work time.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Planito, as a conceptual model, might not align with every local legislation,
    including those that restrict work on weekends. It's important to consider the
    compatibility of Planito with your country's legal framework regarding workdays.

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Planito is designed with the current 7-day week in mind, leveraging the benefits
    of off-peak deep work. If widely adopted, some benefits might diminish, but the
    model's core advantages, like shorter workdays and extended weekends, could still
    offer widespread benefits.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The name is loosely based on the fact that the Planito has the same number of
    days in a week as there are planets in our solar system. Yes, [we still like Pluto](https://www.britannica.com/story/why-is-pluto-no-longer-a-planet).
