    “At first, I couldn’t make out what she was saying; she was crying so much,” Murphy
    says. “All I could hear was ‘Epilim’.” This was a brand name for sodium valproate,
    themedication Murphy had been taking since she was 12 to manage her epilepsy.

    two sons, Lee and Philip. Both spent time in a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU).
    “Within 12 hours of being born, Lee was very jittery, shaky, refusing his feeds,
    and they rushed him off to NICU,” she says. “They explained that it was withdrawal
    from the valproate. He was there for seven days, but they said absolutely nothing

    in Manchester. “The whole family went,” says Williams. “The geneticist told me
    both boys had been diagnosed with FVSD within 24 hours of being born. She said
    she’d looked at the research papers and couldn’t find any reason for the problems
    they were having other than valproate. At first, I was speechless. ‘So the medications
    caused this?’ was my first question. She said: ‘I’m afraid so.’ There was so little
