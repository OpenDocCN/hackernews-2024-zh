    wood-based space satellites including last summer's story that reported that [wood
    from Magnolia's trees](https://www.woodworkingnetwork.com/news/woodworking-industry-news/researchers-lean-magnolia-wood-satellite)
    was the most likely candidate for the job.

    magnolia wood satellite from Kyoto University and Sumitomo Forestry aims to make
    spaceflight operations more environmentally sustainable because the LignoSat is
    biodegradable and will burn up upon reentry after 6 months, leaving only ash.

    changes and exposure to intense cosmic rays and dangerous solar particles for
    10 months, tests confirmed no decomposition or deformations, such as cracking,
    warping, peeling, or surface damage, according to the June 4, 2023, Woodworking

- en: Kyoto University researchers said they favor using magnolia as the primary species
    for WoodSat because of its relatively high workability, dimensional stability,
    and overall strength. LignoSat, which has the backing of Sumitomo Forestry, is
    expected to be jointly launched in 2024 by NASA and JAXA, the Japanese space agency.
