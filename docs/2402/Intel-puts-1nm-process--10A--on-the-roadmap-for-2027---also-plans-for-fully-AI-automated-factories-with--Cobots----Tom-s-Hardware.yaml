    event, but it turns out that Intel miscommunicated about a presentation that was
    thought to be under NDA — now Intel says the presentation is open to be reported
    to the public, so we have some more news to share: Intel''s previously-unannounced
    Intel 10A (analogous to 1nm) will enter production/development in late 2027, marking
    the arrival of the company''s first 1nm node, and its 14A (1.4nm) node will enter
    production in 2026\.  [Edit: *to be clear*, this means 10A is beginning development,
    not entering high volume manufacturing, in 2027] The company is also working to
    create fully autonomous AI-powered fabs in the future.'

    of wafer starts per week) capacity for Intel's various process nodes. Notably,
    capacity typically indicates how many wafers can be started, but not the total
    output — output varies based on yields. You'll notice there isn't a label for
    the Y-axis, which would give us a direct read on Intel's production volumes. However,
    this does give us a solid idea of the proportionality of Intel's planned node
    production over the next several years.

    10A node in late 2027, filling out its roster of nodes produced with EUV technology.
    Intel's 'A' suffix in its node naming convention represents Angstroms, and 10
    Angstroms converts to 1nm, meaning this is the company's first 1nm-class node.

    it classifies a new node as at least having a double-digit power/performance improvement.
    Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger has told us the cutoff for a new node is around a 14%
    to 15% improvement, so we can expect that 10A will have at least that level of
    improvement over the 14A node. (For example, the difference between Intel 7 and
    Intel 4 was a 15% improvement.)

    foundry business have been with the 18A node, which [Intel says is according to

    at once - backside power (PowerVIA) and GAA transistors (RibbonFET). To de-risk
    the process and avoid stumbles like it saw with 10nm, Intel announced in April
    of 2022 that it had run a [different flavor of 20A through its fabs](https://www.anandtech.com/show/17344/intel-opens-d1x-mod3-fab-expansion-moves-up-intel-18a-manufacturing-to-h22024),
    an internal test node with only backside power paired with standard FinFETs, to
    [ensure backside power worked separately before being integrated into the final
    20A node](https://www.tomshardware.com/news/intel-details-powervia-backside-power-delivery-network).

    for quite some time.

    production capacity for Foveros, EMIB, SIP (silicon photonics), and HBI (hybrid
    bond interconnect). Advanced packaging capacity has been a key choke point for
    the current shortages of AI accelerators. This increased capacity will ensure
    a steady supply of advanced processors with complex packaging, including HBM.

- en: Intel's ramp of advanced packaging capacity is explosive — the company had very
    little production capacity for these interconnects in 2023\. As an aside, Intel
    recently wrapped up all of its internal packaging efforts using standard packaging;
    it is now all-in on advanced packaging and will use OSATs (outsourced assembly
    and test companies) for standard packaging tasks.
