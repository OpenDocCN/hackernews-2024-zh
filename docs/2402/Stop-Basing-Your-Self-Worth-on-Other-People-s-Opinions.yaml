- en: Self-worth is our set of core beliefs about our value as a human being. It’s
    how we see ourselves and who we perceive ourselves to be. People differ in what
    they believe they must be or do to have worth or value. When we externalize our
    self-worth, we get emotionally and chemically rewarded when we succeed. This inevitably
    turns into a never-ending loop in pursuit of instant gratification. To undo this,
    we need to develop an awareness of where our self-worth is internally anchored.  <content

    of the popular HBR article [How to Stop Worrying About What Other People Think
    Of You](/2019/05/how-to-stop-worrying-about-what-other-people-think-of-you), high-performance
    psychologist Michael Gervais argues that our fear of other people’s opinions —
    what he calls FOPO — may be the single greatest restrictor of human potential.
    In his new book, [The First Rule of Mastery](https://store.hbr.org/product/the-first-rule-of-mastery-stop-worrying-about-what-people-think-of-you-10551/)
    (Harvard Business Review Press), Gervais, who works with world-renowned athletes,
    artists, and musicians, as well as Fortune 100 leaders and teams, shares the mental
    skills and practices we need to overcome FOPO. This excerpt, which is lightly
    edited, explores our tendency to outsource our self worth — or look to others
    for external validation.*</content>
