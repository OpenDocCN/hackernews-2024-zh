    had been planning an $800 million expansion of his studio in Atlanta, which would
    have added 12 soundstages to the 330-acre property. Now, however, those ambitions
    are on hold — thanks to the rapid developments he’s seeing in the realm of artificial
    intelligence, including [OpenAI’s text-to-video model Sora](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/openai-introduces-ai-video-tools-encroaches-hollywood-1235826527/),
    which debuted Feb. 15 and stunned observers with its cinematic video outputs.

    the capabilities, it was mind-blowing,” he said in an interview with *The Hollywood
    Reporter* on Thursday, noting that his productions might not have to travel to
    locations or build sets with the assistance of the technology.

    as an employer, fellow actor and filmmaker, he also wants to raise the alarm.
    In an interview between shoots Thursday, Perry explained his concerns about the
    technology’s impact on [labor](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/t/labor/) and
    why he wants the industry to come together to tackle AI: “There’s got to be some
    sort of regulations in order to protect us. If not, I just don’t see how we survive.”'

    I was in the middle of, and have been planning for the last four years, about
    an $800 million expansion at the studio, which would’ve increased the backlot
    a tremendous size — we were adding 12 more soundstages. All of that is currently
    and indefinitely on hold because of Sora and what I’m seeing. I had gotten word
    over the last year or so that this was coming, but I had no idea until I saw recently
    the demonstrations of what it’s able to do. It’s shocking to me.

    this AI can generate it like nothing. If I wanted to have two people in the living
    room in the mountains, I don’t have to build a set in the mountains, I don’t have
    to put a set on my lot. I can sit in an office and do this with a computer, which
    is shocking to me.

    miles an hour to try and catch up, to try and put in guardrails and to try and
    put in safety belts to keep livelihoods afloat. But me, just like every other
    studio in town, we’re all trying to figure it all out. I think we’re all trying
    to find the answers as we go, and it’s changing every day — and it’s not just
    our industry, but it’s every industry that AI will be affecting, from accountants
    to architects. If you look at it across the world, how it’s changing so quickly,
    I’m hoping that there’s a whole government approach to help everyone be able to

    bottom line of my studio continuing to do extremely well and avoid the conversation,
    or we can jump in and have the conversation head-on to make sure that we’re protecting
    all the people that are coming up. So I’ve got two sides here to this thing. For
