- en: Since the days of Isaac Newton, the fundamental laws of nature all ultimately
    reduce to a vital, broad set of equations. Now researchers have found a new way
    to use brain-inspired neural networks to solve these equations significantly more
    efficiently than before for numerous potential applications in science and engineering.

    help model [complex physical systems involving multiple rates of change, such
    as ones changing across both space and time](https://uwaterloo.ca/applied-mathematics/future-undergraduates/what-you-can-learn-applied-mathematics/differential-equations/partial-differential-equations-pdes).
    They can help [model](https://www.ias.edu/ideas/curiosities-partial-differential-equations)
    all sorts of things, such as the flow of air past the wings of an airplane, the
    spreading of a pollutant in the air, or the collapse of a star into a black hole.

    numerical methods. However, these can be very time-consuming and computationally
    resource-intensive to run.

    These models, which include [neural networks](https://spectrum.ieee.org/deep-neural-network),
    are trained on data from numerical solvers to predict what answers they might
    produce. However, these still require a large amount of data from numerical solvers
    for training. The amount of data needed increases exponentially as these models
    grow in size, making this strategy difficult to scale, says study lead author
    [Raphaël Pestourie](https://cse.gatech.edu/people/raphael-pestourie), a computational
    scientist at the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta.

- en: In a new study, researchers developed an approach to developing surrogate models.
    This strategy uses physics simulators to help train neural networks to match the
    output of the high-precision numerical systems. The aim is to generate accurate
    results with the help of expert knowledge in a field—in this case, physics—instead
    of merely throwing a lot of computational resources at these problems to find
    solutions using brute force.

    of James Clerk Maxwell) can arrive at solutions to hard mathematical problems
    that had previously required high-precision, brute-force math—symbolized by the
    Maxwell daguerreotype. MIT

    models on three kinds of physical systems. These included diffusion, such as a
    dye spreading in a liquid over time; reaction-diffusion, such as diffusion that
    might take place following a chemical reaction; and electromagnetic scattering.

    as other neural networks at tackling partial differential equations. At the same
    time, these models needed only about 1,000 training points. This reduces the training
    data required by at least a factor of 100 to achieve a target error of 5 percent.

    scientific model do the science,” Pestourie says. “PEDS shows that combining both
    is far greater than the sum of its parts.”

    complex systems that show up everywhere in engineering—weather forecasts, carbon
    capture, and nuclear reactors, to name a few,” Pestourie says.
