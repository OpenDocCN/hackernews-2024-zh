    that can also be used as a medicinal or psychoactive drug. It is a ruderal species,
    preferring dry, nutrient-rich natural and anthropogenic habitats on disturbed
    soils (Weeda *et al*. [Reference Weeda, Westra, Westra and Westra1988](#ref32):
    187). Macrofossils of black henbane are found in numerous archaeological features
    in north-western Europe from the Neolithic onwards (e.g. Otte & Mattonet [Reference
    Otte, Mattonet and Brandes2001](#ref18); Herbig [Reference Herbig, Stobbe and
    Tegtmeier2012](#ref7); RADAR, [2018](#ref22) data). Due to the occurrence of black
    henbane as a weed in and around settlements, it is notoriously difficult to interpret
    the significance of these finds, although some archaeological evidence does suggest
    that its psychoactive properties were understood and exploited by people (e.g.
    Knörzer [Reference Knörzer1965](#ref11); Penz *et al.* [Reference Pentz, Baastrup,

- en: The recent (2017) discovery of a sheep/goat bone that had been hollowed out,
    sealed on one side by a plug of a black material and filled with hundreds of black
    henbane seeds provides an opportunity to gain new insight into the historical
    use of this species. Bioarchaeological analysis of the bone, which was found at
    the Roman rural site of Houten-Castellum in the Netherlands, allows us to assess
    the different interpretations of black henbane within this region and the wider
    Empire. In this article, we explore Roman-period finds of black henbane from the
    Netherlands and descriptions of this species in Classical texts, its occurrence
    and possible uses. We consider the bone container from Houten-Castellum, its context
    and the results of its analysis within the broader argument for the intentional
    use of black henbane in the past.

    family—the nightshades. Nowadays the species is scarce in the Netherlands, but
    it may be encountered in ruderal habitats—locations where the soil is disturbed
    and nutrients are added by the action of humans, animals, water or erosion (Weeda
    & Schaminée [Reference Weeda, Schaminée, Schaminée, Weeda and Westhoff1998](#ref31):
    247–54). The natural habitats of this plant species are, for example, river areas
    and coastal zones where it is mainly found on dry, calcareous and very nutrient-rich
    sand and clay soils (Weeda *et al.* [Reference Weeda, Westra, Westra and Westra1988](#ref32):
    187). Black henbane also thrives in settlement areas, especially on dunghills
    and in nutrient-rich locations in vegetable gardens.'

    north-western Europe. The oldest finds are associated with the Bandkeramik culture
    (*c*. 5500–4500 BC) (Knörzer [Reference Knörzer and Beyer1998](#ref12); Herbig
    [Reference Herbig, Stobbe and Tegtmeier2012](#ref7); Tegel *et al*. [Reference
    Tegel, Elburg, Hakelberg, Stäuble and Büntgen2012](#ref25)). It is possible that
    these first farmers brought this plant species with them, either intentionally
    or unintentionally. Black henbane is a ‘weed of cultivation’, it grows in the
    favourable conditions of cultivated land and its seeds may be harvested and sown
    unintentionally, effectively migrating with farming communities. This makes it
    particularly difficult to prove intentional use of the plant when it is found
    at archaeological sites; seeds may have accidentally been harvested and stored
    or entered archaeological features when plants grew in settlements. Herbig ([Reference
    Herbig, Stobbe and Tegtmeier2012](#ref7)) suggests that black henbane was already
    used by people in the Bandkeramik culture for its psychoactive properties. Evidence
    for this may be seen in the large numbers of black henbane seeds found in wells
    in Sachsen, Germany (at the archaeological sites of Schkeuditz-Altscherbitz, Brodau,
    Dresden-Cotta, Eythra and Leipzig-Plaußig), and the co-occurrence of other utilitarian
    plant species, for example vegetables, artisanal and medicinal plants (Herbig
    [Reference Herbig, Stobbe and Tegtmeier2012](#ref7): 153), in these wells.'

    onwards and is found at many Roman sites (see online supplementary material (OSM)
    Tables S1 & S2 for further details and references). Most of these sites are located
    in the Dutch river area and the Meuse valley, areas in which the environment reflects
    the optimal growing conditions for the species nowadays. Often, one to several
    dozen seeds are found as part of an assemblage of species that would otherwise
    be expected in a settlement location. Occasionally, individual or a small number
    of charred black henbane seeds are found in samples containing cereals and arable
    weeds. In these cases, it is possible that black henbane grew on the edge of arable
    fields and thus made its way into charred threshing waste.

- en: To try to distinguish between intentional use of black henbane as a medicinal
    or psychoactive drug and its natural occurrence as a ruderal, three approaches
    are taken. First, we look at the archaeological contexts in which henbane is found.
    Finds from inside containers, in hospital contexts or graves, especially if the
    number of seeds is large, are considered indicative of intentional use by humans.
    Second, we consider other artefacts within these contexts; recovery of black henbane
    together with ‘exceptional finds’, for example in features with abandonment offerings,
    may also suggest intentional human use. Third, following Herbig ([Reference Herbig,
    Stobbe and Tegtmeier2012](#ref7)), we catalogue the presence of cultivated plant
    species or useful wild plant species within the same contexts as black henbane.
    Frequent co-occurrence of species may indicate intentional use by humans.

- en: 'With the exception of an inflorescence—the complete flower head, including
    stems, stalks and seed pods—found at Houten-Castellum (see below), all finds of
    black henbane from the Roman Netherlands are waterlogged or charred seeds. The
    difficulty of the third approach is that many wild plant species with medicinal,
    symbolic or artisanal uses could have been common in areas surrounding settlements.
    Therefore, we compare the finds of black henbane with other useful plant species
    that are relatively uncommon in archaeobotanical assemblages in the Netherlands:
    deadly nightshade (*Atropa bella-donna*, medicinal/psychoactive), black horehound
    (*Ballota nigra*, medicinal), common St John''s wort (*Hypericum perforatum*,
    medicinal), motherwort (*Leonurus cardiaca*, medicinal), white horehound (*Marrubium
    vulgare*, medicinal), catmint (*Nepeta cataria*, medicinal), dyer''s rocket (*Reseda
    luteola*, artisanal), wild mignonette (*Reseda lutea*, medicinal) and vervain
    (*Verbena officinalis*, medicinal, symbolic). While black horehound, common St
    John''s wort, dyer''s rocket and vervain grew or were grown in the Netherlands
    prior to the Roman period, there is no evidence for white horehound and catmint.
    Deadly nightshade, motherwort and wild mignonette seem to be Roman introductions
    that subsequently survived independently (see OSM2 & OSM3). We also looked at
    herbs that were introduced to the Netherlands in the Roman period: dill (*Anethum
    graveolens*), coriander (*Coriandrum sativum*) and rue (*Ruta graveolens*). Both
    dill and coriander are interpreted as medicinal plants in the Roman hospital at
    Neuss (Knörzer [Reference Knörzer1965](#ref11)) but were also used in the Roman
    kitchen. Rue is also mentioned as a kitchen herb and medicinal plant in classical
    texts (*Apicius* for example 3.9[87], 8.8[386], 9.1[402]; Vehling [Reference Vehling1977](#ref30);
    Dioscorides, *De Materia Medica* 5.42; Osbaldeston & Wood [Reference Osbaldeston
    and Wood2000](#ref17); Pliny the Elder, *Naturalis Historia* 24.90; Jones & Andrews
    [Reference Jones and Andrews1956](#ref9)). After their introduction, these species
    were probably cultivated in vegetable gardens. Another cultivated species which
    is known as a food plant and medicine is the opium poppy (*Papaver somniferum*)
    (Bakels & Kuijper [Reference Bakels, Kuijper, Brinkkemper, Deeben, van Doesburg,
    Hallewas, Theunissen and Verlinde2006](#ref1): 12).'

    henbane is best for cures and the black should be avoided due to its stronger
    effects. Henbane seeds can be made into a juice for curing all kinds of pain,
    mucus and disorders of the womb, while the leaves can be applied to the body to

    these, one is identified as having black seeds and purple flowers in contrast
    to the more common white kind. Pliny warns that all kinds cause insanity and giddiness
    but a white variety which grows by the sea is most used ‘by medical men’. Juice
    extracted from the stem and leaves of the plant can be used to remedy chest complaints
    such as coughs—though the fume of burning henbane may also help joint ailments,
    gout and tendonitis (*Naturalis Historia* 22.58, 26.15, 26.64–66; Jones [Reference
    Jones1951](#ref8); Jones & Andrews [Reference Jones and Andrews1956](#ref9)).
    Chewing henbane root with vinegar is suggested as a remedy for toothache, while
    the root in an ointment alleviates pains of the womb (*Naturalis Historia* 25,
    105, 26.90). A honey-wine with asses’ milk and the seeds of anise and henbane
    helps against flatulence and shortness of breath (*Naturalis Historia* 20.73)
    and juice obtained from the seeds may be used as an emollient (*Naturalis Historia*
    23.49) or poured in the ears to cure earache (*Naturalis Historia* 25.103), but
    Pliny warns this deranges the brain. In fact, he finds the drug dangerous in any
    form. He notes that drinking wine with four or more leaves was believed to bring
    down fever, but paradoxically there were also remedies for those who had taken
    this drink. Thus, Pliny concludes that henbane was both a poison and a remedy
    (*Naturalis Historia* 25.17).

    heating of the outside of the bone cylinder ([Figure 5](#fig05)), but this may
    also be caused by natural soil processes and does not necessarily reflect burning.
    In fact, many bones from waterlogged conditions at this archaeological site show
    similar black marks and streaks. The seeds are waterlogged and do not show evidence
    of charring so are unlikely to be the remains of pipe use, unless the pipe had
    been filled ready for its next use before deposition. Even if that were the case,
    there are a lot of seeds considering how potent the plant is supposed to be. The
    deviating design of the bone object compared to other known pipes and the fact
    that it has only one opening also argue against its use as a pipe. It is possible
    that the object was not a pipe for smoking but was used to heat the seeds gently
    to release vapour that could then be inhaled, as described by Pliny (*Naturalis
    Historia* 26.15; Jones & Andrews [Reference Jones and Andrews1956](#ref9)). Pipes
    of any kind are, however, extremely rare in Europe before the arrival of tobacco;
    we found only one example, from Bronze Age Germany (Rind [Reference Rind1994](#ref24)).

    for the black henbane seeds. It was permanently closed on one side by the birch-bark
    tar plug and on the other side it may originally have been closed by some perishable
    material that has either been removed or has not been preserved. The large number
    of waterlogged seeds would fit with the interpretation of this find as a container
    and its contents.

    medicinal/useful wild plant species and the four cultivated kitchen herbs/medicinal
    species, are found at 83 Roman-period sites in the Netherlands (see OSM3). Black
    henbane is found at 65 of the 83 sites. The other species are found in combination
    with black henbane more often than they are found without it. Black henbane occurs
    with at least one of the other species at 42 sites. At 23 sites black henbane
    occurred without any of these other species.

    Here, four plant species that prefer calcareous soils—black henbane, vervain,
    motherwort and black horehound—grew in the acidic to neutral sandy sediments.
    The latter species is not mentioned in Roman texts but later historical sources
    do mention its medicinal qualities (Kooistra *et al.* [Reference Kooistra, Troostheide,

    habitats. It is possible that they ended up in anthropogenic features naturally,
    as many other wild plant species do. Nevertheless, we cannot exclude the possibility
    that there is a connection between the species, related to the possible medicinal
    use of black henbane and the 13 other species. In this case, these species may
    have been cultivated in vegetable gardens for their possible application, though
    for now this remains a hypothesis that requires further testing.

    because the plant can grow naturally in and around settlements. The discovery
    of a bone container filled with a large quantity of black henbane seeds from a
    Roman site in the Netherlands is a convincing case for the intentional exploitation
    of this plant. While the bone object could be a pipe used for smoking black henbane,
    the overall design of the cylinder and the large quantity and uncharred state
    of the seeds speak against such an interpretation.

- en: Black henbane at Houten-Castellum fits the first category in two ways. First,
    the seeds were found in a container. Second, the context of the find is considered
    special because of the combination of items within the water-pit deposit and its
    interpretation as an abandonment offering. This fits with other special finds
    from wells in the Roman Netherlands, which are suggested to relate to lifecycle
    rituals (van Haasteren & Groot [Reference van Haasteren and Groot2013](#ref26)).
    A second deposit at Houten-Castellum, containing a black henbane inflorescence,
    is also interpreted as an abandonment offering. While we cannot exclude the possibility
    that the plant grew in the vicinity of the enclosure ditch and entered the deposit
    through natural processes, it seems too much of a coincidence to find black henbane
    in two contemporaneous abandonment deposits.

    black henbane is found in combination with one to eight other species with a possible
    medicinal use at 42 archaeological sites. More research is needed to test whether
    this combination is accidental or intentional.

    of seeds. Herbig ([Reference Herbig, Stobbe and Tegtmeier2012](#ref7): 154) argues
    that charred seeds probably came into contact with domestic fires, which strongly
    suggests human action but charring could also occur during the processing of cereal
    grains. In that case, the plants may have grown on the edges of arable fields
    and the seeds were unintentionally harvested and processed. Black henbane produces
    large volumes of seeds and, if plants grew naturally in or around settlements,
    it is possible that a whole plant or inflorescence may occasionally have ended
    up in an archaeological feature. Therefore, although the bone container demonstrates
    that black henbane held significance for the inhabitants of Houten-Castellum,
    we cannot exclude the possibility that the inflorescence from the second abandonment
    deposit at Houten-Castellum ended up there by accident.'

    the Netherlands in the Roman period. This find, as well as results from pottery
    from Roman Belgium (Oudemans [Reference Oudemans2009](#ref19)), shows that black
    material and black crusts on pottery rims are worthy of further investigation.

- en: 'Instances where the intentional human use of black henbane can be proven beyond
    a reasonable doubt are rare. Only a handful of archaeological examples can be
    cited: one find in a grave and three finds from hospitals. The discovery at Houten-Castellum,
    in the Roman Netherlands, of a bone cylinder closed at one end with a birch-bark
    tar plug and filled with black henbane seeds therefore provides an important new
    case for the deliberate collection and use of seeds from this plant. Classical
    texts describe the use of henbane as a medicinal plant and it seems that its uses
    were also known on the northern edge of the Roman Empire. The two possible interpretations
    of the bone cylinder are that of a pipe or of a container. We argued against an
    interpretation as a pipe because the bone was not heated and the black henbane
    seeds were uncharred. Only one part of the tar plug was heated and this may have
    occurred prior to its insertion into the bone cylinder.'

    with an inflorescence of black henbane recovered from a second abandonment deposit
    further strengthens our conclusion that black henbane was an important plant in
    Houten-Castellum. This importance was probably also reflected across the wider
    Roman Netherlands given the frequent association of black henbane with other plants
    with known medicinal properties in this area, though more research is needed to
    understand whether these associations are accidental or intentional. Since one
    plant can produce hundreds of seeds, concentrations of black henbane seeds can
    occur naturally and a large number of seeds by itself cannot be used as an argument
    for human use.

- en: Black henbane presents problems for archaeobotanical interpretation as it could
    occur naturally at most of the archaeological sites where it has been found. For
    this reason, it is usually grouped with wild plants. Our analyses show that the
    plant was used by people but unequivocal cases of intentional use are very rare.
    Nevertheless, we suggest that black henbane should not be disregarded as a wild
    plant so quickly in the future; the contexts of finds and associations with other
    plant species and artefacts should first be carefully considered.
