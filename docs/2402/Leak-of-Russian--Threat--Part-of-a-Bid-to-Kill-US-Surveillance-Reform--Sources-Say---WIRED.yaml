- en: While redirecting blame away from Turner and his cohorts, the claim is both
    false and deceptive, relying on assertions that, while farcical perhaps to legal
    experts, would be impossible for the public at large (and most of the press) to
    parse alone.

    on the final page](https://rules.house.gov/sites/republicans.rules118.house.gov/files/MG_02_xml.pdf)
    of the bill online—does nothing, in reality. It does not require or prevent anyone
    in the government from taking any action whatsoever. It also has no impact on
    FISA, the statute from which Section 702 derives its power.

- en: The controversial text states that the nation’s top intelligence official “may
    submit” information to Congress regarding how “law enforcement agencies and the
    intelligence community” purchase “commercially available data about United States
    persons.” Essentially, it grants the intelligence community permission to do something
    that it does not actually need permission to do.

- en: The language was included not to “totally screw” FISA, but to ensure that the
    phrase “commercially available data” appears at least once in the text, for reasons
    that are as benign as they are elusive to casual followers of legislative procedures.

- en: One of the most popular amendments suggested to the Section 702 bill, discussed
    openly by lawmakers for months, is one that would prevent the government from
    purchasing data that normally requires a warrant. To counter arguments that these
    purchases are unrelated (which is to say, not “germane”) to the 702 program, the
    language in the final section, accomplishing nothing else, was added. A placeholder,
    effectively.

    impossible for Turner not to know the amendment was coming, and that the surprise
    expressed by his staff in the Fox News piece and elsewhere appeared to those in
    the know as pure theater.

    confirm that Turner had been aware for weeks, if not months, that restrictions
    on commercially available data would be one of the key amendments offered up by
    Judiciary members. The aides added that he''d also privately agreed to allow Judiciary
    members to offer their amendments. Prior to the bill being pulled, Representatives
    Warren Davidson and Zoe Lofgren had issued a relevant joint statement publicly:
    “It makes little sense to rein in warrantless surveillance under one authority
    when the government can simply fall back on other available techniques to acquire
    similar information,” they said.'

    aide working for a Judiciary member. “It’s the amendment they’re freaking out
    about. They don’t want the intelligence community to have to ask judges before
    they do anything.”

    aren’t purchasing our data that often, Turner just blew weeks of negotiation to
    defend this one thing,” says the same aide. “To me, that says something about
    how much the government actually cares about this.”
