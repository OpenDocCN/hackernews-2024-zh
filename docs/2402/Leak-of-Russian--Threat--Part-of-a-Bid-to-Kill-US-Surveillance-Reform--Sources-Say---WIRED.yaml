- en: While redirecting blame away from Turner and his cohorts, the claim is both
    false and deceptive, relying on assertions that, while farcical perhaps to legal
    experts, would be impossible for the public at large (and most of the press) to
    parse alone.

  zh: 尽管将责任转移至特纳及其同僚之外，这一声明既虚假又欺骗，依赖于对法律专家也许荒谬的主张，对大多数公众（以及大多数新闻界）而言，单凭自己的解析几乎是不可能的。

    in the government from taking any action whatsoever. It also has no impact on
    FISA, the statute from which Section 702 derives its power.

  zh: 福克斯新闻的情报来源所指的文本可以在法案的最后一页[阅读](https://rules.house.gov/sites/republicans.rules118.house.gov/files/MG_02_xml.pdf)。实际上，这些内容并没有任何作用。它既不要求也不阻止政府中的任何人采取任何行动。它对外国情报监视法案也没有影响，这是
    702 条款所依据的法律。
- en: The controversial text states that the nation’s top intelligence official “may
    submit” information to Congress regarding how “law enforcement agencies and the
    intelligence community” purchase “commercially available data about United States
    persons.” Essentially, it grants the intelligence community permission to do something
    that it does not actually need permission to do.

  zh: 这一具有争议性的文本规定，国家最高情报官员“可以提交”有关“执法机构和情报社区”如何购买“关于美国人的商业可用数据”的信息给国会。实质上，这授权情报社区做某些它实际上不需要许可的事情。
- en: The language was included not to “totally screw” FISA, but to ensure that the
    phrase “commercially available data” appears at least once in the text, for reasons
    that are as benign as they are elusive to casual followers of legislative procedures.

  zh: 这种措辞的加入并非为了完全搞砸外国情报监视法案，而是为了确保“商业可用数据”这一短语至少在文本中出现一次，这种原因对于对立法程序漠不关心的人来说既无害又难以捉摸。
- en: One of the most popular amendments suggested to the Section 702 bill, discussed
    openly by lawmakers for months, is one that would prevent the government from
    purchasing data that normally requires a warrant. To counter arguments that these
    purchases are unrelated (which is to say, not “germane”) to the 702 program, the
    language in the final section, accomplishing nothing else, was added. A placeholder,
    effectively.

  zh: 对于 702 条款提出的最受欢迎的修正案之一，几个月来议员们公开讨论，其中之一是阻止政府购买通常需要搜查令的数据的修正案。为了反驳这些购买与 702 计划无关的论点（也就是说，不“相关”），最终章节中的措辞，实际上除了这一点外没有其他影响，被添加了。这实际上是一个占位符。
- en: A senior source close to the Judiciary Committee said that it would have been
    impossible for Turner not to know the amendment was coming, and that the surprise

    confirm that Turner had been aware for weeks, if not months, that restrictions
    on commercially available data would be one of the key amendments offered up by
    Judiciary members. The aides added that he''d also privately agreed to allow Judiciary
    members to offer their amendments. Prior to the bill being pulled, Representatives
    Warren Davidson and Zoe Lofgren had issued a relevant joint statement publicly:
    “It makes little sense to rein in warrantless surveillance under one authority
    when the government can simply fall back on other available techniques to acquire
    similar information,” they said.'

  zh: 四名助手、几场公开听证的录音以及大量报道证实，特纳已经在数周甚至数月前就知道，对商业可用数据的限制将成为司法委员会成员提出的关键修正案之一。助手补充说，他还私下同意让司法委员会成员提出他们的修正案。在法案被撤回之前，华伦·戴维森和佐伊·洛夫格伦代表公开发表了相关联合声明：“当政府可以简单地依靠其他可用技术获取类似信息时，在一项权威的无监管监视授权下收紧搜查令不合理。”
