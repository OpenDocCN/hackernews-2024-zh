- en: RAD has become aware of a problem that can cause Oodle Data decompression failures,
    or crashes in games built with Unreal. We believe that this is a hardware problem
    which affects primarily Intel 13900K and 14900K processors, less likely 13700,
    14700 and other related processors as well. Only a small fraction of those processors
    will exhibit this behavior. The problem seems to be caused by a combination of
    BIOS settings and the high clock rates and power usage of these processors, leading
    to system instability and unpredictable behavior under heavy load.

- en: As far as we can tell, there is not any software bug in Oodle or Unreal that
    is causing this. Due to what seem to be overly optimistic BIOS settings, some
    small percentage of processors go out of their functional range of clock rate
    and power draw under high load, and execute instructions incorrectly. This is
    being seen disproportionately in Oodle Data decompression because unlike most
    gameplay, simulation, audio or rendering code, decompression needs to perform
    extra integrity checks to handle accidentally or maliciously corrupted data, and
    is thus likely to spot inconsistencies very soon after they occur. These decode
    failures then typically result in an error message.

- en: However, this problem does not only affect Oodle, and machines that suffer from
    this instability will also exhibit failures in standard benchmark and stress test
    programs. Any programs which heavily use the processor on many threads may cause
    crashes or unpredictable behavior. There have been crashes seen in RealBench,
    CineBench, Prime95, Handbrake, Visual Studio, and more. This problem can also
    show up as a GPU error message, such as spurious "out of video memory" errors,
    even though it is caused by the CPU.

- en: We do not have acccess to diagnostic processor information that would nail down
    the exact cause and best workaround for this problem. It seems that many motherboard/BIOS
    manufacturers are shipping with settings that push the processor outside its safe
    operating range. Because this problem appears to affect only a small fraction
    of processors, some users have had success with returning their processor to the
    manufacturer and getting a new one which doesn't exhibit the problem.
  id: totrans-split-13

- en: Other workarounds require using tuning utilities or modifying BIOS settings.
    Note that doing so incorrectly can cause damage to your system. The changes we
    are recommending here are, to the best of our knowledge, completely safe, but
    you are solely responsible for any damages or loss caused by changing these settings
    from their factory defaults. If you are uncomfortable or worried about using tuning
    utilities (even officially sanctioned ones) or changing your BIOS settings, and
    frequent crashes also occur in the benchmark programs mentioned previously, you
    should be able to return the CPU or the entire computer to the manufacturer instead.

- en: A reportedly successful workaround for many people is to use [Intel XTU](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/download/17881/intel-extreme-tuning-utility-intel-xtu.html)
    and lower the Performance Core multiplier from x55 to x54 or x53\. Apparently,
    affected titles may then crash one more time during load immediately after, but
    will work afterwards (we have not been able to confirm this ourselves). Using
    XTU is likely the quickest and easiest way to go and doesn't even require rebooting
    to try different settings, but you might need to reapply it after every start
    if you don't save the profile. (Alternatively, set the P-core multiplier in the
    BIOS instead.)

- en: In the BIOS, if you have enabled any overclocking, please turn it off; do not
    use "AI" or "automatic" overclocking. Even if you have not explicitly enabled
    any overclocking, many BIOSes are doing some by default, so on affected machines
    you will have to find those settings and turn them off. Every BIOS has slightly
    different names for the settings; we cannot provide exact instructions of which
    settings to look for all of them. Some of these settings may be in the Advanced
    or Overclocking submenu of the BIOS.
