- en: Memfault is the first IoT reliability platform that empowers teams to build
    more robust devices at scale. Today hardware teams have little insight into how
    their products are performing and what issues are driving the majority of field
    failures; with Memfault, they can operate with the same speed and agility as software
    organizations. Companies like Lyft, Logitech, Bose, Whoop, and Verkada use Memfault's
    performance monitoring, device debugging, and OTA update capabilities to ship
    fast and build high-quality products. Memfault was founded by veterans of Pebble,
    Fitbit, and Oculus and is backed by Stripes, Uncork Capital, Partech, the 5G Innovation
    Lab, S28 Capital, and Y Combinator. Learn more about
