    highway guardrail system and found it to be incapable of handling the increasing
    number of SUVs and pickups at the time. Guardrails were then redesigned to handle
    the larger, heavier vehicles that were becoming more and more popular. But that
    was 30 years ago, long before the recent onslaught of shockingly heavy electric
    vehicles. What happens when a 7,100-pound [Rivian](https://www.thedrive.com/category/rivian-news)
    R1T hits a 30-year-old guardrail design? It tears through it like tissue paper,
    which you can see in this new video from the Midwest Roadside Safety Facility
    at the University of Nebraska.

    both the University of Nebraska and Army Corps of Engineers collaborated to crash
    a [Rivian R1T](https://www.thedrive.com/new-cars/2022-rivian-r1t-electric-pickup-review-features-price-competitors-info)
    into a guardrail at 60 mph for research purposes. The 7,100-pound truck obliterates
    the guardrail and vaults over the concrete median that followed. Although the
    test initially appears to show an head-on impact, which could be considered unlikely
    and unrealistic, footage later in the video clarifies that the pickup meets the
    guardrail at an oblique angle. The barrier used in the test was 31 inches high,
    made from 12-gauge corrugated steel, mounted on six-inch-deep steel posts.

    than 5,000 pounds," Cory Stolle, from the university’s Midwest Roadside Safety
    Facility, told the *AP*. Many EVs exceed that 5,000-pound weight limit, or are
    much heavier. The Army Corps of Engineers also crash-tested a Tesla into the guardrail
    and, rather than going through it, it went underneath and continued.

    to their unique packaging without engines and transmissions getting in the way.
    However, that safety is *internal*. Researchers noted that the passenger compartment
    of the R1T in question was fine after the test, and its occupants would likely
    have walked away from the crash without serious injury. However, those passengers
    wouldn't be as lucky if their electric pickup ripped through a guardrail at the
    edge of a cliff, and it goes without saying that anyone in another, lighter vehicle
    colliding with the Rivian would be at serious risk, too.

- en: It's worth noting that EVs aren't the only vehicles that crest the 5,000-pound
    mark. Any full-sized, heavy-duty pickup on the market will easily surpass 6,000
    pounds, with some like the Ford F-350 and Silverado HD 2500 even exceeding 7,000
    pounds. Even the [Chevy Suburban](https://www.thedrive.com/new-cars/2022-chevy-suburban-review-a-simple-beast-with-a-simple-mission),
    a fairly common vehicle for families, can tip the scales at over 6,000 pounds
    depending on its powertrain. But EVs are universally heavier than gas cars of
    equal dimensions thanks to their batteries, and many of them are already beyond
    the limit.

    they can change again. While Stolle isn't certain what types of materials or construction
    will be needed, suggesting the potential need for more concrete barriers, this
    is a problem the country has solved before. "We need to know as much as we can
    now because it takes time to design new systems, evaluate them, and confirm those
    results with full-scale crash testing," Stolle told *[Nebraska Today](https://news.unl.edu/newsrooms/today/article/nebraska-experts-weigh-highway-safety-and-electric-vehicles/)*.

    won't always keep them on the road in the event of a crash. If it were me, I wouldn't
    do much canyon mobbing in a Rivian R1T or [Tesla Cybertruck](https://www.thedrive.com/news/tesla-cybertruck-owner-gets-coming-soon-message-when-trying-to-lock-diff)
    anytime soon.
