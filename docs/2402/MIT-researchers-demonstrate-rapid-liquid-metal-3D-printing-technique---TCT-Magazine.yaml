- en: Researchers at the [**Massachusetts Institute of Technology**](https://www.mit.edu)
    (MIT) have developed a new additive manufacturing technique that can print rapidly
    with liquid metal, producing large-scale parts such as table legs and chair frames
    in a matter of minutes according to the team.

- en: The technique, known as liquid metal printing (LMP), involves depositing molten
    aluminium along a predefined path into a bed of tiny glass beads. The aluminium
    then hardens into a 3D structure.

    metal additive manufacturing process, and the procedure to heat and melt the metal
    is more efficient than other methods.

    that while it can print components that are larger than those typically made with
    slower 3D printing techniques, and at a lower cost, it cannot achieve high resolutions.

    the team demonstrated the procedure by 3D printing aluminium frames and parts
    for tables and chairs which were strong enough to withstand postprint machining.
    They showed how components made with LMP could be combined with high-resolution
    processes and additional materials to create functional furniture.

    that has some huge advantages. It has downsides, too. But most of our built world
    – the things around us like tables, chairs, and buildings – doesn’t need extremely
    high resolution. Speed and scale, and also repeatability and energy consumption,
    are all important metrics,” said Skylar Tibbits, associate professor in the Department
    of Architecture and co-director of the Self Assembly Lab, who is senior author
    of a paper introducing LMP.

    a PhD student at ETH Zurich; as well as Kimball Kaiser SM ’22 and Jared Laucks,
    a research scientist and lab co-director. The research was presented at the Association
    for Computer Aided Design in Architecture Conference and recently published in
    the association’s proceedings.

- en: Drawing on the group’s previous work on rapid liquid printing with rubber, the
    researchers built a machine that melts aluminium, holds the molten metal, and
    deposits it through a nozzle at high speeds. The team says that large-scale parts
    can be printed in a few seconds, and then the molten aluminium cools in several
    minutes.

    It is more or less like opening a faucet. You have a big volume of material to
    melt, which takes some time, but once you get that quickly to melt, it is just
    like opening a tap. That enables us to print these geometries very quickly,” explained
    Karsan.

    which is essentially a “scaled up toaster” according to Karsan. Metal coils inside
    the furnace heat the metal to 700 degrees Celsius, slightly above aluminium’s
    660 degree melting point.

    molten material is gravity-fed through a ceramic nozzle into a print bed along
    a preset path. They found that the larger the amount of aluminium they could melt,
    the faster the printer can go.

    with stainless steel nozzles and then moved to titanium before we ended up with
    ceramic. But even ceramic nozzles can clog up because the heating is not always
    entirely uniform in the nozzle tip,” said Karsan.

    don’t need to print supports to hold the aluminium structure as it takes shape.

- en: The team experimented with a number of materials to fill the print bed, including
    graphite powders and salt, before selecting 100-micron glass beads. The tiny glass
    beads, which can withstand the high temperature of molten aluminium, act as a
    neutral suspension so the metal can cool quickly.

    is so small that it doesn’t really change the surface characteristics of the printed
    object,” added Tibbits.

- en: The amount of molten material held in the crucible, the depth of the print bed,
    and the size and shape of the nozzle have the biggest impacts on the geometry
    of the final object. Parts of the object with larger diameters are printed first,
    since the amount of aluminium the nozzle dispenses tapers off as the crucible
    empties. Changing the depth of the nozzle alters the thickness of the metal structure.

    which were durable enough to withstand machining processes such as milling and
    boring. The researchers demonstrated a combination of LMP and the post processing
    techniques to make chairs and a table composed of lower-resolution, rapidly printed
    aluminium parts and other components, such as wood pieces.

    down recycled aluminium and print parts, that would be a game-changer in metal
    manufacturing. Right now, it is not reliable enough to do that, but that’s the
    goal,” says Tibbits.

    who was not involved in the work added: “At Emeco, we come from the world of very
    analog manufacturing, so seeing the liquid metal printing creating nuanced geometries
    with the potential for fully structural parts was really compelling. The liquid
    metal printing really walks the line in terms of ability to produce metal parts
    in custom geometries while maintaining quick turnaround that you don’t normally
    get in other printing or forming technologies. There is definitely potential for
    the technology to revolutionise the way metal printing and metal forming are currently
    handled.”'
