    him inaccurate information.

- en: The Civil Resolution Tribunal's decision on the dispute was [posted online Wednesday](https://decisions.civilresolutionbc.ca/crt/crtd/en/item/525448/index.do),
    finding in favour of a man who relied on information provided by the bot about
    fares when he was booking a flight to attend his grandmother's funeral.

    tribunal member Christopher C. Rivers wrote, awarding $650.88 in damages for negligent
    misrepresentation.'

- en: Jake Moffatt was booking a flight to Toronto and asked the bot about the airline's
    bereavement rates – reduced fares provided in the event someone needs to travel
    due to the death of an immediate family member.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Moffatt said he was told that these fares could be claimed retroactively by
    completing a refund application within 90 days of the date the ticket was issued,
    and submitted a screenshot of his conversation with the bot as evidence supporting
    this claim.

- en: He submitted his request, accompanied by his grandmother's death certificate,
    in November of 2022 – less than a week after he purchased his ticket. But his
    application was denied and the tribunal decision said emails submitted as evidence
    showed that Moffatt's attempts to receive a partial refund continued for another
    two-and-a-half months.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The airline refused the refund because it said its policy was that bereavement
    fare could not, in fact, be claimed retroactively.

    with the chatbot and received a response in which Air Canada "admitted the chatbot
    had provided 'misleading words.'"

    the claim with the tribunal.

    provided by the bot.

- en: '"In effect, Air Canada suggests the chatbot is a separate legal entity that
    is responsible for its own actions. This is a remarkable submission. While a chatbot
    has an interactive component, it is still just a part of Air Canada’s website,"
    Rivers wrote.'

    on its website. It makes no difference whether the information comes from a static
    page or a chatbot."'

- en: The airline also argued that the chatbot's response to Moffatt's inquiry included
    a link to a section of its website that outlined the company's policy and said
    that requests for a discounted fare are not allowed after someone has travelled.
  prefs: []

    another part of its website, it does not explain why the webpage titled ''Bereavement
    travel'' was inherently more trustworthy than its chatbot. It also does not explain
    why customers should have to double-check information found in one part of its
    website on another part of its website," he wrote.'

    accurate information. I find that was reasonable in the circumstances. There is
    no reason why Mr. Moffatt should know that one section of Air Canada’s webpage
    is accurate, and another is not."'

    what Moffatt paid for his flight and a discounted bereavement fare.

    and $125 in fees.
