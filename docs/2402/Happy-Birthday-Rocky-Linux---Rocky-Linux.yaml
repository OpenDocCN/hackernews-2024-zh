- en: 'Today we celebrate how far Rocky Linux has come since the ecosystem change
    that started it all. The early days were full of emotion and fire as a group of
    passionate people united around a common goal: to preserve a version of Enterprise
    Linux (EL) that would be maintained by the community and available to whoever
    needed it.'

    will always be pushback against it. The project has experienced pushback for sure.
    But pushback can lead to positive discourse, and discourse is healthy — it helps
    refine the goal and move change forward.

    as host for the world’s fastest growing EL distribution. This Foundation exists
    to preserve the legacy of EL for the community and by the community, and to ensure
    that no single entity, whether individual or corporate, can determine its destiny.
    The RESF is now home not just to Rocky Linux, but to Peridot Build System, the
    open automated build tool created by members of the Rocky team to ensure the project
    remains insulated from unpredictable factors.

    [sponsors](https://rockylinux.org/sponsors) CIQ, 45 Drives, AWS, Google Cloud,
    and Monta Vista have been enthusiastic cornerstone RESF contributors, as have
    additional sponsors OpenLogic by Perforce and Pro Computers. The financial support,
    donated time, and infrastructure partnerships created necessary momentum.

    space, and more that make it possible to do all the things that make it Rocky
    Linux. The RESF is forever grateful to ARM, Equinix, Fastly, Mattermost, Open
    Drives, Open Source Lab, Rakuten Symphony, SuperMicro, and VMWare for sustaining
    the project’s momentum through this venture.

    of Rocky Linux, the contributors and enthusiasts bring great energy as well. The
    RESF has no paid employees, so it depends on the countless hours of contributions
    from many volunteers. In addition, Rocky owes a lot of its wide adoption to the
    support of administrators everywhere who have advocated to migrate their systems
    to this distribution.

- en: This past summer the project weathered news of more dramatic change. But all
    that did was inspire the team to reach out in other directions, and solidify connections
    within the larger EL community. Out of that conversation came collaborations with
    Fedora, CentOS, and more. Because the path to future success for all of us is
    to recognize we share space in the open EL community, and we can all benefit more
    from collaboration than contention.

    has been good news for the entire EL community. This brand new open project commits
    to hold the source code for EL for the community. It contains the pieces for anyone,
    or any project, to build their own distribution. While Rocky Linux is currently
    surviving and thriving by its own method of collecting the source code, the existence
    of OpenELA is a welcome upstream addition to the ecosystem; it offers great insurance
    and peace of mind against the next, inevitable, news of a dramatic change.
