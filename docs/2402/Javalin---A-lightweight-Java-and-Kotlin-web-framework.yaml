- en: Unlike other Java and Kotlin web frameworks, Javalin has very few concepts that
    you need to learn. You never extend classes and you rarely implement interfaces.

- en: Javalin is just a few thousand lines of code on top of Jetty, and its performance
    is equivalent to raw Jetty code. Due to its size, it's very easy to reason about
    the source code.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Other Java and Kotlin web frameworks usually offer one version for each language.
    Javalin is being made with inter-operability in mind, apps are built the same
    way in both Java and Kotlin.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Javalin is designed to be simple and blocking, as this is the easiest programming
    model to reason about. But, if you set a `Future` as a result, Javalin switches
    into asynchronous mode.

- en: Javalin runs on top of Jetty, one of the most used and stable web-servers on
    the JVM. You can configure the Jetty server fully, including SSL and HTTP3 and
    everything else that Jetty offers.
