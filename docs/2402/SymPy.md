# SymPy

> 来源：[https://www.sympy.org/en/index.html](https://www.sympy.org/en/index.html)

## Why SymPy

SymPy is…

*   **Free:** Licensed under BSD, SymPy is free both as in speech and as in beer.
*   **Python-based:** SymPy is written entirely in Python and uses Python for its language.
*   **Lightweight:** SymPy only depends on [mpmath](http://mpmath.org/), a pure Python library for arbitrary floating point arithmetic, making it easy to use.
*   **A library:** Beyond use as an interactive tool, SymPy can be embedded in other applications and extended with custom functions.

## Projects using SymPy

This is an (incomplete) list of projects that use SymPy. If you use SymPy in your project, please let us know on our [mailinglist](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/sympy), so that we can add your project here as well.

*   **[Cadabra](https://cadabra.science)**: Tensor algebra and (quantum) field theory system using SymPy for scalar algebra.
*   **[ChemPy](https://github.com/bjodah/chempy)**: A package useful for chemistry written in Python.
*   **[devito](https://www.devitoproject.org)**: A symbolic DSL and just-in-time compiler for high performance stencil computation.
*   **[EinsteinPy](https://einsteinpy.org)**: A Python package for symbolic and numerical General Relativity.
*   **[galgebra](https://galgebra.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)**: Geometric algebra (previously sympy.galgebra).
*   **[LaTeX Expression project](https://mech.fsv.cvut.cz/~stransky/software/latexexpr/doc/)**: Easy LaTeX typesetting of algebraic expressions in symbolic form with automatic substitution and result computation).
