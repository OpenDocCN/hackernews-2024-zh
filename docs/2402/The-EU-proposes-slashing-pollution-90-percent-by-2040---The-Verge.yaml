    on how much of those pollution cuts should come from risky tactics aimed at *capturing*

    a glaring omission in the draft: while it mentions phasing out coal, there’s no

    to phase out fossil fuels during a United Nations climate conference in Dubai
    last December. Despite dozens of countries pushing for that kind of commitment,
    the agreement ultimately calls for “transitioning away from fossil fuels in energy
    systems, in a just, orderly and equitable manner.” It also carves out room for
    controversial technologies for capturing carbon dioxide pollution.

    of the total 90 percent cut in emissions could be achieved through carbon capture
    and removal (bringing the real-world reduction target down to 82 percent). It

    document for capturing carbon dioxide emissions today alongside the 2040 plan.
    “European industry is working hard to reduce its emissions, but there are certain
    sectors where processes are particularly hard to adapt, and changes are costly
    to implement. For this reason, we need to boost innovation in technologies to
    capture, transport and store carbon, to make them an effective climate solution,”
    Executive Vice-President of the European Commission Maroš Šefčovič said in a press
    release.

    2040, the EU would need to be able to store 280 million metric tons of captured

    of Sweden’s annual CO2 emissions, roughly 50 million metric tons of the greenhouse
    gas.'

    the unnerving scale of the carbon removal problem in 2022, and the needle hasn’t
    changed much since then.) It costs around $600 per metric ton to remove that CO2
    from the atmosphere, making it a prohibitively expensive venture at the moment.

    work. The 2040 target also includes similarly pricey technologies affixed to power
    plants and other sources of pollution that are supposed to capture a portion of
    CO2 generated by burning fossil fuels before they can escape into the environment.

    longer,” says Sarah Brown, Europe programme director for energy think tank Ember.
