    Byzantines’ were invented by western European scholars to deny the identity of
    this state and its people, who were Roman, no less so than Caesar and Hadrian.
    But this is now widely recognised, so I will move on.

- en: The next biggest mistake we make concerns the nature of the east Roman state
    and its relationship with its subjects. For too long, this empire was seen as
    an example of ‘oriental despotism’, an oppressive tyranny that stripped its subjects
    of freedom, rights and dignity, forcing them to become servile flatterers or peasants
    who were bled dry by crushing taxation. In the later 20th century, historians
    rejected this caricature, but the picture they put in its place – that of a state
    which did little more than tax its subjects from a distance for the benefit of
    a few cynical ‘elites’ – is just as wrong. The truth is much more interesting
    and helps to explain how this state managed to survive over a thousand of the
    most dangerous years of history while rival empires were collapsing around it.

- en: The east Roman state cultivated a relationship of responsiveness and accountability
    towards its subjects. Emperors routinely announced that tax revenues would be
    used for the common good and public interest, not for private advantage. They
    made good on this by spending most of their money on a pan-Roman army for the
    defence of all provinces. Furthermore, they welcomed petitions and appeals from
    their subjects on matters legal and fiscal – and answered them. They issued laws
    that enabled those subjects to bring formal complaints against the abuses of officials.
    Emperors presented themselves as protectors of the weak and poor against the oppression
    of ‘the powerful’. Overall, I believe they persuaded their subjects of their sincerity.
    As a result, subjects paid taxes, generally followed the law, and did not seek
    to break away from central control. By premodern standards, Romanía (its real
    name) was a highly accountable, responsive – and therefore resilient – state.

- en: There’s a lot to unpick. Gibbon wrote of seven centuries of decline after the
    sixth century, and of a long line of weak ‘Greek’ emperors, a prejudice perhaps
    reinforced for some by an awareness of the idea that Moscow is the ‘Third Rome’,
    or that Putin lays claim to Byzantium and its history. Byzantine historians are
    all too aware of this baggage. They know that ignoring it and writing only for
    their peers will condemn the subject to its small niche, the preserve of only
    a few. The search for better strategies is therefore imperative. Can Byzantium
    be made to seem more familiar, less bureaucratic, more creative and less of a
    backwater – normalised, in fact? Perhaps those Byzantine editors of classical
    texts were not so stupid, and perhaps all that ceremonial pomp was deceptive (a
    thought prompted by the ostentatious displays at our own recent royal funeral
    and coronation). The current fashion for the term ‘Roman’ rather than ‘Byzantine’
    is simply a further move in the quest to rescue Byzantium from prejudice (though
    having to add ‘Eastern’ hints at an underlying uncertainty) and aims to deal with
    the uncomfortable prominence of religion.

    the problem and confront it full-on. Byzantium was part of the entangled histories
    of late antiquity and the medieval and early modern periods. Were that to be recognised
    it might finally achieve the place in our consciousness that it richly deserves.

    Greek became the language of Byzantine administration and the territories of the

    probably composed as an oral poem in the frontier-zone, *Digenis Akrites* was
    recorded in Constantinople. The imperial court took interest in this. Emperor
    Manuel I Komnenos (1143-80) is even referred to as a ‘new Akrites’ in a panegyric
    poem dedicated to him. Meanwhile the 12th-century Byzantine intellectual John
    Tzetzes (probably of a mixed Georgian origin himself) opens his *Theogony* (an
    account of the genealogy of the Greek gods) by bragging about his language skills.
    He claims he can greet people on the streets of Constantinople in Scythian (Turkic,
    probably Cuman), Persian (probably Seljuq), Latin, Alan (probably Old Ossetian),
    Slavonic, Hebrew and Arabic. ‘You will find me to be a Scythian among Scythians,
    a Latin among Latins, and among all other ethnicities being like one of their
    race’, he writes. Tzetzes saw himself as a citizen of the world, and all the world
    was Byzantium.

- en: This essentialist identification of the state with the Church does not tell
    the whole story, but seems crucial to perceptions of the Byzantine Empire. For
    the Balkan nations that emerged from the Ottoman Empire (which conquered Byzantium,
    occupied its geographical position and reused its capital), the Orthodox Church
    (and its Byzantine roots) became one of the most powerful and enduring agents
    of identity during the Ottoman centuries. For western European and American audiences
    (at whom many publications and exhibitions are aimed) the religious hue of commercialised
    Byzantium takes a different form, standing for transcendence, spirituality and
    luxury, an ancient, exotic, ‘Other’, which indirectly emphasises the superiority
    of the West as rational, unfrivolous and modern.

- en: What can we do to change this perception, to counterbalance the mental image
    of the ever-praying Byzantines? I advocate focusing on what the Byzantines called
    ‘thyrathen’, which means outside the (Church) door, or what is secular. The playful
    imitations and allusions to antiquity on silk, ivory, glass, silverware and illuminated
    manuscripts; the vast but little-known collections of scientific literature (on
    medicine, astronomy, philosophy and much more); the volumes and volumes of ornate
    prose and poetry devoted to entirely non-religious subjects including friendship,
    hunting, satire and romance, proving that the Byzantines also exercised, laughed
    and liked to think about sex (in case you were wondering). And let’s not forget
    Greek fire, a Byzantine weapon so powerful that it appears in the *Game of Thrones*
    universe. A recalibration of our perception of Byzantium is long overdue.
