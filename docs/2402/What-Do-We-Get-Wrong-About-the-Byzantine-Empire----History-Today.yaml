- en: The next biggest mistake we make concerns the nature of the east Roman state
    and its relationship with its subjects. For too long, this empire was seen as
    an example of ‘oriental despotism’, an oppressive tyranny that stripped its subjects
    of freedom, rights and dignity, forcing them to become servile flatterers or peasants
    who were bled dry by crushing taxation. In the later 20th century, historians
    rejected this caricature, but the picture they put in its place – that of a state
    which did little more than tax its subjects from a distance for the benefit of
    a few cynical ‘elites’ – is just as wrong. The truth is much more interesting
    and helps to explain how this state managed to survive over a thousand of the
    most dangerous years of history while rival empires were collapsing around it.

  zh: 我们下一个最大的错误涉及东罗马帝国的本质及其与臣民的关系。长期以来，这个帝国被看作是‘东方专制主义’的典范，一种压迫性的暴政，剥夺了臣民的自由、权利和尊严，迫使他们成为谄媚的奴仆或被沉重税赋榨干的农民。在20世纪后期，历史学家们拒绝了这种夸张的刻板印象，但他们所描绘的图景
    – 一个几乎仅仅是从远处向臣民征税以供少数精英阶层利益的国家 – 也是错误的。事实要复杂得多，并且有助于解释这个国家如何在历史上最为危险的一千多年中生存下来，而其他竞争的帝国则相继崩溃。
- en: The east Roman state cultivated a relationship of responsiveness and accountability
    towards its subjects. Emperors routinely announced that tax revenues would be
    used for the common good and public interest, not for private advantage. They
    made good on this by spending most of their money on a pan-Roman army for the
    defence of all provinces. Furthermore, they welcomed petitions and appeals from
    their subjects on matters legal and fiscal – and answered them. They issued laws
    that enabled those subjects to bring formal complaints against the abuses of officials.
    Emperors presented themselves as protectors of the weak and poor against the oppression
    of ‘the powerful’. Overall, I believe they persuaded their subjects of their sincerity.
    As a result, subjects paid taxes, generally followed the law, and did not seek
    to break away from central control. By premodern standards, Romanía (its real
    name) was a highly accountable, responsive – and therefore resilient – state.

    – 并且回应。他们颁布法律，使这些臣民能够正式投诉官员的滥权行为。君主们将自己塑造为‘强者’压迫下的弱者和穷人的保护者。总的来说，我相信他们说服了他们的臣民他们的真诚。因此，臣民们交税，普遍遵守法律，不寻求脱离中央控制。按照前现代标准，罗马尼亚（其真实名称）是一个高度负责、响应迅速
    – 因此具有弹性的国家。

- en: There’s a lot to unpick. Gibbon wrote of seven centuries of decline after the
    sixth century, and of a long line of weak ‘Greek’ emperors, a prejudice perhaps
    reinforced for some by an awareness of the idea that Moscow is the ‘Third Rome’,
    or that Putin lays claim to Byzantium and its history. Byzantine historians are
    all too aware of this baggage. They know that ignoring it and writing only for
    their peers will condemn the subject to its small niche, the preserve of only
    a few. The search for better strategies is therefore imperative. Can Byzantium
    be made to seem more familiar, less bureaucratic, more creative and less of a
    backwater – normalised, in fact? Perhaps those Byzantine editors of classical
    texts were not so stupid, and perhaps all that ceremonial pomp was deceptive (a
    thought prompted by the ostentatious displays at our own recent royal funeral
    and coronation). The current fashion for the term ‘Roman’ rather than ‘Byzantine’
    is simply a further move in the quest to rescue Byzantium from prejudice (though
    having to add ‘Eastern’ hints at an underlying uncertainty) and aims to deal with
    the uncomfortable prominence of religion.

- en: A different and better strategy would be to raise consciousness, acknowledge
    the problem and confront it full-on. Byzantium was part of the entangled histories

    Manuel I Komnenos (1143-80) is even referred to as a ‘new Akrites’ in a panegyric
    poem dedicated to him. Meanwhile the 12th-century Byzantine intellectual John
    Tzetzes (probably of a mixed Georgian origin himself) opens his *Theogony* (an
    account of the genealogy of the Greek gods) by bragging about his language skills.
    He claims he can greet people on the streets of Constantinople in Scythian (Turkic,
    probably Cuman), Persian (probably Seljuq), Latin, Alan (probably Old Ossetian),
    Slavonic, Hebrew and Arabic. ‘You will find me to be a Scythian among Scythians,

    imitations and allusions to antiquity on silk, ivory, glass, silverware and illuminated
    manuscripts; the vast but little-known collections of scientific literature (on
    medicine, astronomy, philosophy and much more); the volumes and volumes of ornate
    prose and poetry devoted to entirely non-religious subjects including friendship,
    hunting, satire and romance, proving that the Byzantines also exercised, laughed
    and liked to think about sex (in case you were wondering). And let’s not forget
