    memory (RAM)**, which is significantly faster than traditional disk-based storage.

    away on the shelf. It sends the data to the browser instantly, resulting in a
    blazing-fast page load.
  prefs:
  - PREF_OL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If the data isn't in the cache (a **cache miss**), it's like the book being
    checked out or misplaced. Redis then goes to the slower "main library" (database)
    to retrieve the data.
  prefs:
  - PREF_OL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Redis retrieves the data from the database and, like a good librarian, also
    adds it to its own "memory shelves" for future requests. This way, if someone
    else wants the same page, it's readily available in the cache, saving another
    trip to the database.
  prefs:
  - PREF_OL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Like a library backing up its collection, Redis can optionally write the cached
    data to disk (RDB or AOF) in case of power outages or restarts. This ensures data
