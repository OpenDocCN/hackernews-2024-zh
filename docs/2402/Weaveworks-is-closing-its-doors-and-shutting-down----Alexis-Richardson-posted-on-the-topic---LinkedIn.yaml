- en: 'UPDATE on Weaveworks and Flux Thank-you to everyone who responded to my post
    (below). The support and emotion for the Weaveworks team has been so tangible
    and moving. Now, I hope to provide several updates starting with GOOD NEWS today.
    Most of the Weaveworks team have found jobs quite quickly. This feels like an
    enormous relief, but it is 100% to *their credit* for being such fantastic people.
    We now move the Weaveworks "company" into a wider "community". Our core is the
    CNCF open source projects especially FluxCD. Beyond that Weave people built Flux-Terraform,
    Flux-Backstage, Weave Gitops, fleets, pipelines, and so much more. This represents
    an amazing group of project -- all open source -- so let''s make more of it. Starting
    with Flux. This project is in GOOD SHAPE. We are moving from a concentration of
    maintainers in one company, to a new stable position in which multiple companies
    want to help Flux. They must be welcomed. I want to especially highlight Gitlab
    for their strong statement here - [https://lnkd.in/eQKGrpwr](https://lnkd.in/eQKGrpwr?trk=public_post-text)
    MANY others have spoken and you can join them. From the Azure folks out to a multitude
    of smaller companies, vendors, consultants, end users, there is a groundswell
    of support here - [https://lnkd.in/eci7WHzR](https://lnkd.in/eci7WHzR?trk=public_post-text)
    - and more have been in touch privately. I am going to get all of these discussions
    into the public domain now and the goal is to have a set of thriving community
    projects: * CNCF Flux * Flux Infra as Code kicked off last week * Flux GUI * Weave
    website and Gitops Sets and more WE SHALL MEET AT KUBECON in 2 weeks [https://lnkd.in/emBvfHxG](https://lnkd.in/emBvfHxG?trk=public_post-text)
    Commercial "enterprise" partners must contact Armanino. Open source people please
    ping me. Please remember we are all in this together! --alexis'

- en: Hi everyone I am very sad to announce - officially - that Weaveworks will be
    closing its doors and shutting down commercial operations.  Customers and partners
    will be working with a financial trustee whom we shall announce soon. The company
    was turning over double digit (>$10M) revenue and had more than doubled the number
    of new product logos in 2023.  However this sales growth was lumpy and our cash
    position, consequently volatile.  We needed a partner or investor for long term
    growth.  Finally a very promising M&A process with a larger company fell through
    at the 11th hour.  And so we decided to shut down.  I can only apologize to everyone
    for this difficult turn.   I could say that this should not have happened, but
    I know that we are not alone in this market.  Bigger vessels have gone astray. 
    The Weaveworks team is a special group and it has been a long and tough journey. 
    I know that everyone has been so motivated to do their very best for our customers,
    our open source community, and each other.  You have done well and can be proud. 
    We shall always have a shared story. Our story has been so exciting - from the
    first days of containers, struggling to be born.  The day when someone got Kubernetes
    working for the first time on Azure.  The start of the CNCF.  The day when we
    wiped out our systems with a keypress.  The first months of the Covid pandemic. 
    Then investment and our work to figure out GitOps for a lot of great enterprise
    customers.  And there have been dire moments too but we figured most of them out
    together. You’ve shared all of this and all deserve every memory of a good place
    to work, and with the privilege of knowing that all of you are among the best.
    The story does not end here - our open source software is used everywhere.  I
    am working with several large organizations to make sure CNCF Flux is in the healthiest
    state.  More on that soon.  And I would invite anyone who reads this and wants
    to know what is next or offer some help, please get in touch with me!  Thank you.
    We shall not cease from exploration And the end of all our exploring Will be to
    arrive where we started And know the place for the first time. Alexis Richardson,

  zh: 大家好，我很遗憾地宣布 - 正式地 - Weaveworks 将关闭其业务并停止商业运营。客户和合作伙伴将与一个财务受托人合作，我们将很快宣布。公司的营业额超过了两位数（>$10M），2023年新产品标识数量翻了一番以上。然而，这种销售增长波动较大，因此我们的现金状况也很不稳定。我们需要一个长期增长的合作伙伴或投资者。最终，与一家较大公司的非常有前途的并购过程在最后一刻失败了。因此我们决定关闭。我只能为这一艰难的转折向每个人道歉。我可以说这不应该发生，但我知道我们在这个市场上并不孤单。更大的船只也曾偏离航线。Weaveworks团队是一个特别的团队，这是一段漫长而艰难的旅程。我知道每个人都非常积极地为我们的客户、我们的开源社区和彼此竭尽全力。你们做得很好，可以感到自豪。我们将永远拥有一个共同的故事。我们的故事非常激动人心
    - 从容器诞生的最初日子开始。有人第一次在Azure上让Kubernetes工作的那一天。CNCF的开始。我们用一次按键抹去系统的那一天。新冠疫情爆发的头几个月。然后是投资，以及我们为许多优秀的企业客户找出GitOps的工作。当然也有艰难的时刻，但我们大多数都一起克服了。你们分享了所有这些，都应该对这里是一个良好工作场所的每一个记忆感到自豪，并且有幸知道你们都是最好的人之一。故事并不会在这里结束
    - 我们的开源软件无处不在使用。我正在与几个大型组织合作，确保CNCF Flux处于最健康的状态。更多内容即将公布。如果有人阅读此文并想知道接下来的事情或提供帮助，请与我联系！谢谢。我们不会停止探索，而所有探索的尽头将是回到起点，并第一次认识到那个地方。亚历克西斯·理查德森，2024年2月5日
