- en: 'UPDATE on Weaveworks and Flux Thank-you to everyone who responded to my post
    (below). The support and emotion for the Weaveworks team has been so tangible
    and moving. Now, I hope to provide several updates starting with GOOD NEWS today.
    Most of the Weaveworks team have found jobs quite quickly. This feels like an
    enormous relief, but it is 100% to *their credit* for being such fantastic people.
    We now move the Weaveworks "company" into a wider "community". Our core is the
    CNCF open source projects especially FluxCD. Beyond that Weave people built Flux-Terraform,
    Flux-Backstage, Weave Gitops, fleets, pipelines, and so much more. This represents
    an amazing group of project -- all open source -- so let''s make more of it. Starting
    with Flux. This project is in GOOD SHAPE. We are moving from a concentration of
    maintainers in one company, to a new stable position in which multiple companies
    want to help Flux. They must be welcomed. I want to especially highlight Gitlab
    for their strong statement here - [https://lnkd.in/eQKGrpwr](https://lnkd.in/eQKGrpwr?trk=public_post-text)
    MANY others have spoken and you can join them. From the Azure folks out to a multitude
    of smaller companies, vendors, consultants, end users, there is a groundswell
    of support here - [https://lnkd.in/eci7WHzR](https://lnkd.in/eci7WHzR?trk=public_post-text)
    - and more have been in touch privately. I am going to get all of these discussions
    into the public domain now and the goal is to have a set of thriving community
    projects: * CNCF Flux * Flux Infra as Code kicked off last week * Flux GUI * Weave
    website and Gitops Sets and more WE SHALL MEET AT KUBECON in 2 weeks [https://lnkd.in/emBvfHxG](https://lnkd.in/emBvfHxG?trk=public_post-text)
    Commercial "enterprise" partners must contact Armanino. Open source people please
    ping me. Please remember we are all in this together! --alexis'

- en: Hi everyone I am very sad to announce - officially - that Weaveworks will be
    closing its doors and shutting down commercial operations.  Customers and partners
    will be working with a financial trustee whom we shall announce soon. The company
    was turning over double digit (>$10M) revenue and had more than doubled the number
    of new product logos in 2023.  However this sales growth was lumpy and our cash
    position, consequently volatile.  We needed a partner or investor for long term
    growth.  Finally a very promising M&A process with a larger company fell through
    at the 11th hour.  And so we decided to shut down.  I can only apologize to everyone
    for this difficult turn.   I could say that this should not have happened, but
    I know that we are not alone in this market.  Bigger vessels have gone astray. 
    The Weaveworks team is a special group and it has been a long and tough journey. 
    I know that everyone has been so motivated to do their very best for our customers,
    our open source community, and each other.  You have done well and can be proud. 
    We shall always have a shared story. Our story has been so exciting - from the
    first days of containers, struggling to be born.  The day when someone got Kubernetes
    working for the first time on Azure.  The start of the CNCF.  The day when we
    wiped out our systems with a keypress.  The first months of the Covid pandemic. 
    Then investment and our work to figure out GitOps for a lot of great enterprise
    customers.  And there have been dire moments too but we figured most of them out
    together. You’ve shared all of this and all deserve every memory of a good place
    to work, and with the privilege of knowing that all of you are among the best.
    The story does not end here - our open source software is used everywhere.  I
    am working with several large organizations to make sure CNCF Flux is in the healthiest
    state.  More on that soon.  And I would invite anyone who reads this and wants
    to know what is next or offer some help, please get in touch with me!  Thank you.
    We shall not cease from exploration And the end of all our exploring Will be to
    arrive where we started And know the place for the first time. Alexis Richardson,
    5 Feb 2024
