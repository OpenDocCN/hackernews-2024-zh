- en: Food manufacturers often add preservatives to food products to keep them fresh.
    A primary purpose of these preservatives is to kill microbes that could break
    down and otherwise spoil the food. Common additives like sugar, salt, vinegar
    and alcohol have been used as preservatives for centuries, but modern-day food
    labels now reveal more unfamiliar ingredients such as sodium benzoate, calcium
    propionate, and potassium sorbate.

- en: Bacteria produce chemicals called bacteriocins to kill microbial competitors.
    These chemicals can serve as natural preservatives by killing potentially dangerous
    pathogens in food. Lanthipeptides, a class of bacteriocins with especially potent
    antimicrobial properties, are widely used by the food industry and have become
    known as “lantibiotics” (a scientific portmanteau of lanthipeptide and antibiotics).

- en: Despite their widespread use, however, little is known about how these lantibiotics
    affect the gut microbiomes of people who consume them in food. Microbes in the
    gut live in a delicate balance, and commensal bacteria provide important benefits
    to the body by breaking down nutrients, producing metabolites, and—importantly—protecting
    against pathogens. If too many commensals are indiscriminately killed off by antimicrobial
    food preservatives, opportunistic pathogenic bacteria might take their place and
    wreak havoc—a result no better than eating contaminated food in the first place.

- en: A new study published in *ACS Chemical Biology* by scientists from the University
    of Chicago found that one of the most common classes of lantibiotics has potent
    effects both against pathogens and against the commensal gut bacteria that keep
    us healthy.

- en: Nisin is a popular lantibiotic used in everything from beer and sausage to cheese
    and dipping sauces. It is produced by bacteria that live in the mammary glands
    of cows, but microbes in the human gut produce similar lantibiotics too. Zhenrun
    “Jerry” Zhang, PhD, a postdoctoral scholar in the lab of Eric Pamer, MD, the Donald
    F. Steiner Professor of Medicine and Director of the Duchossois Family Institute
    at UChicago, wanted to study the impact of such naturally-produced lantibiotics
    on commensal gut bacteria.

- en: “Nisin is, in essence, an antibiotic that has been added to our food for a long
    time, but how it might impact our gut microbes is not well studied,” Zhang said.
    “Even though it might be very effective in preventing food contamination, it might
    also have a greater impact on our human gut microbes.”

- en: He and his colleagues mined a public database of human gut bacteria genomes
    and identified genes for producing six different gut-derived lantibiotics that
    closely resemble nisin, four of which were new. Then, in collaboration with Wilfred
    A. van der Donk, PhD, the Richard E. Heckert Endowed Chair in Chemistry at the
    University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, they produced versions of these lantibiotics
    to test their effects on both pathogens and commensal gut bacteria. The researchers
    found that while the different lantibiotics had varying effects, they killed pathogens
    and commensal bacteria alike.

- en: “This study is one of the first to show that gut commensals are susceptible
    to lantibiotics, and are sometimes more sensitive than pathogens,” Zhang said.
    “With the levels of lantibiotics currently present in food, it’s very probable
    that they might impact our gut health as well.”

- en: Zhang and his team also studied the structure of peptides in the lantibiotics
    to better understand their activity, in the interest of learning how to use their
    antimicrobial properties for good. For example, in another study, the Pamer lab
    showed that a consortium of four microbes, including one that produces lantibiotics,
    help protect mice against antibiotic-resistant *Enterococcus* infections. They
    are also studying the prevalence of lantibiotic-resistant genes across different
    populations of people to better understand how such bacteria can colonize the
    gut under different conditions and diets.

- en: “It seems that lantibiotics and lantibiotic-producing bacteria are not always
    good for health, so we are looking for ways to counter the potential bad influence
    while taking advantage of their more beneficial antimicrobial properties,” Zhang
    said.
