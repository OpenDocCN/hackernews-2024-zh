- en: On February 21st, 2024, Resend experienced an [outage](https://resend-status.com/incident/329826)
    that affected all users due to a database migration that went wrong. This prevented
    users from using the API (including sending emails) and accessing the dashboard
    from 05:01 to 17:05 UTC (about 12 hours).
  id: totrans-split-7

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The database migration accidentally deleted data from production servers. We
    immediately began the restoration process from a backup, which completed 6 hours
    later. Unfortunately, once it finished, we found that it failed to restore the
    data, so we had to start the restoration process a second time with a different
    backup.
  id: totrans-split-8

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: During this time, no API requests were being accepted and no data being stored.
    For data created prior to the migration, there was 5 minute of data loss from
    when the migration started and the database went offline from 04:50:00 to 04:56:27
    UTC. We are currently working on re-populating the data from this 5-minute window.

- en: We sincerely apologize for the impact and inconvenience caused by this outage.
    We place immense importance on reliability, but this week, we fell short of our
    commitment to you all. It is clear that we have a long way to go in becoming an
    industry-leading infrastructure provider, but in learning from this incident,
    we will improve our operations and tooling to avoid outages like this in the future,
    whatever the cause.

- en: While building a feature, we performed a database migration command locally,

    all tables in production.

- en: The first attempt to restore the database took 6 hours but failed due to a wrong
    selection of the backup timestamp. The second attempt to restore took an extra
    5 hours and succeeded, bringing all data back besides a 5-minute window of data
    loss.
