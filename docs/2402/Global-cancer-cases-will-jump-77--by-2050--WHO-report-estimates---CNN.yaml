    from the World Health Organization – an increase of 77% from the 20 million cases
    diagnosed in 2022.

    released Friday by WHO’s International Agency for Research on Cancer, covers 185
    countries and 36 forms of the disease. The researchers found that lung cancer
    was the most common form around the world in 2022 – responsible for 2.5 million
    cases, 12.4% of the total – followed by female breast, colorectal, prostate and
    stomach cancers. Lung cancer was also responsible for the most cancer deaths:
    1.8 million, or almost 19% of the total.'

    For example, in countries with a very high Human Development Index – a measure
    of achievements in health, education and standard of living – 1 in 12 women will
    be diagnosed with breast cancer, and 1 in 71 will die of it. In low-HDI countries,
    only 1 in 27 women will be diagnosed with breast cancer, but 1 in 48 will die
    of it, largely due to late diagnosis and a lack of access to treatments.

    transplants.

    protection for cancer around the world, with populations, especially in lower
    income countries, unable to access the basics of cancer care,” Dr. Bente Mikkelsen,
    director of WHO’s Department of Noncommunicable Diseases, said in a news release.
    “WHO, including through its cancer initiatives, is working intensively with more
    than 75 governments to develop, finance and implement policies to promote cancer
    care for all. To expand on this work, major investments are urgently needed to
    address global inequities in cancer outcomes.”

    cancer rates, such as obesity, tobacco use and alcohol use, as well as environmental

    while incidence rates of certain forms of the disease increase, according to [a
    report](https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/17/health/cancer-incidence-rising-report/index.html) released
    last month by the American Cancer Society.

- en: From 1991 to 2021, cancer deaths in the US fell 33%, largely due to drops in
    tobacco use, earlier detection and major improvements in treatments. However,
    racial disparities persist, with people of color facing higher risks.

    noted. The share of colorectal cancer diagnoses in adults under 55, for example,
    rose from 11% in 1995 to 20% in 2019, previous research has found.

    with his [Cancer Moonshot effort](https://www.cnn.com/2023/09/13/politics/joe-biden-cancer-cabinet/index.html) aimed
    at slashing US cancer deaths in half in 25 years. Agencies including NASA and
    the Environmental Protection Agency have been engaged to join the effort alongside
    the Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of Veterans Affairs.

    the treatment and care of cancer patients – significant disparities in cancer
    treatment outcomes exist not only between high and low income regions of the world,
    but also within countries. Where someone lives should not determine whether they
    live. Tools exist to enable governments to prioritise cancer care, and to ensure
    that everyone has access to affordable, quality services. This is not just a resource
    issue but a matter of political will,” Dr. Cary Adams, head of the Union for International
    Cancer Control, said in Friday’s news release from the International Agency for
    Research on Cancer.
