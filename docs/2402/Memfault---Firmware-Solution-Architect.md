Memfault is seeking an embedded software engineer to join as a Firmware Solution Architect. You’ll be working with others on the Developer Experience team to build out Memfault’s firmware SDK spanning across a multitude of MCU architectures, RTOS’s, and vendor libraries. You’ll also be working with cutting-edge IoT companies as they integrate Memfault for the first time or add support for newly built features.

*NOTE: We believe people in the same office work better together for a variety of reasons. Therefore, there is a strong preference for employees to work within the offices listed (SF, NYC, Boston). If you are confident we should make an exception, or you are hoping to move to one of these cities upon taking this job, **let us know in your application**!*

If you are hired into our SF, Boston, or NYC work location, the compensation range for this position is between $100,000 and $170,000 based on a full-time schedule. The salary may vary depending on your location and confirmed job-related skills and experience. Incentives such as bonuses may be available for this position for the potential to earn more. For part-time roles, your compensation will be adjusted to reflect your hours.

**About Memfault**

Memfault is the first IoT reliability platform that empowers teams to build more robust devices at scale. Today hardware teams have little insight into how their products are performing and what issues are driving the majority of field failures; with Memfault, they can operate with the same speed and agility as software organizations. Companies like Lyft, Logitech, Bose, Whoop, and Verkada use Memfault's performance monitoring, device debugging, and OTA update capabilities to ship fast and build high-quality products. Memfault was founded by veterans of Pebble, Fitbit, and Oculus and is backed by Stripes, Uncork Capital, Partech, the 5G Innovation Lab, S28 Capital, and Y Combinator. Learn more about
