- en: 'The late [André Bensoussan](multicians.html#Bensoussan "Multician: Designer
    (GE/CISL): File manager, Initialization, AIM, NSS.") worked with me on the Multics
    operating system at Honeywell in Cambridge. We were working on a [major change](mgn.html#NSS
    "glossary: New Storage System. MR 4.0 included a rewritten storage...") to the
    file system, which required a subsystem, the [VTOC](mgv.html#VTOC "glossary: Volume
    Table of Contents. Region of a physical volume...") manager, to manage file description
    information. It had to transport the file information between disk and memory,
    manage a shared memory buffer pool, and manage space on disk for the information.
    In other words, it was a small virtual memory manager.'

    He started by sitting at his desk and drawing a lot of diagrams. I was the project
    coordinator, so I used to drop in on him and ask how things were going. "Still
    designing," he'd say. He wanted the diagrams to look beautiful and symmetrical
    as well as capturing all the state information. I was getting nervous about the
    schedule, so I was glad when he finally began writing code. He wrote in pencil,
    at his desk, instead of using a terminal. He declined offers of typing help, and
    just kept writing away in pencil. He rewrote parts, copied things over, erased
    and rewrote.

    program in. His first compilation attempt failed; he corrected three typos, tried
    again, and the code compiled. We bound it into the system and tried it out, and
    it worked the first time.

    system VTOC manager.") worked perfectly from then on. Only one bug was ever found
    in it, and that was my fault: André had asked me the calling sequence for an error
    procedure, and I''d guessed instead of looking it up, so it crashed the first
    time it hit an error. Beyond that the program was perfect.'
