- en: 'Before he conceived of Peter Pan, J. M. Barrie decided it was time to grow
    up and quit smoking. He justifies this decision in *My Lady Nicotine: A Study
    in Smoke* (originally published in 1890), which begins with a common trio of arguments
    against substance addiction. The bodily and spiritual ruin; the economic impact;
    the pain caused to loved ones. In the case of our narrator (who seems to be a
    lightly fictionalized Barrie): he felt frequently like he was dying; realized
    several oriental rugs could be purchased yearly with the money saved; and delayed
    his marriage six months when his fiancée demanded cessation. Slowly, however,
    this “study” diffuses into a different mode. At the introduction’s close, fidgeting
    in the drawing room with postprandial cravings, he listens to his wife sing a
    sweet and mournful song, which takes his thoughts far away, to a parlor on the
    top floor of an inn, where time seems to slow as his body''s hunger warmly fades,
    like coals in the hearth that throw light around this room — onto newspapers,
    through smoke rings, across the faces of gentleman friends, and against the contours
    of a tobacco jar. It’s a lost world, once known so well, and he pulls up a chair
    and begins to pack a pipe. “After a time the music ceases, and my wife puts her
    hand on my shoulder. Perhaps I start a little, and then she says I have been asleep.
    This is the book of my dreams.”'
