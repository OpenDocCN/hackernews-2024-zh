- en: In the hours following the release of [CVE-2023-6246](https://www.qualys.com/2024/01/30/cve-2023-6246/syslog.txt)
    for the project [GNU glibc](https://sourceware.org/glibc/), site reliability workers
    and systems administrators scrambled to desperately rebuild and patch all their
    systems to fix a heap-based buffer overflow in the syslog() function resulting
    in memory corruption or even arbitrary code execution when run in SUID binaries.
    This is due to the affected components being written in C, the only programming
    language where these vulnerabilities regularly happen. "This was a terrible tragedy,
    but sometimes these things just happen and there's nothing anyone can do to stop
    them," said programmer Willodean Santorella, echoing statements expressed by hundreds
    of thousands of programmers who use the only language where 90% of the world's
    memory safety vulnerabilities have occurred in the last 50 years, and whose projects
    are 20 times more likely to have security vulnerabilities. "It's a shame, but
    what can we do? There really isn't anything we can do to prevent memory safety
    vulnerabilities from happening if the programmer doesn't want to write their code
    in a robust manner." At press time, users of the only programming language in
    the world where these vulnerabilities regularly happen once or twice per quarter
    for the last eight years were referring to themselves and their situation as "helpless."
