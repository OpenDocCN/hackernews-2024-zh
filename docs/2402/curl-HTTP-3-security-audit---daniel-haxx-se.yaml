- en: An external security audit focused especially on curl’s HTTP/3 components and
    associated source code was recently concluded by [Trail of Bits](https://www.trailofbits.com/).
    In particular on the HTTP/3 related curl code that uses and interfaces the ngtcp2
    and nghttp3 libraries, as that is so far the only HTTP/3 backend in curl that
    is not labeled as experimental. The audit was sponsored by [the Sovereign Tech
    Fund](https://www.sovereigntechfund.de/) via [OSTIF](https://ostif.org/).

    improved fuzzing and a few additional areas are noted as suitable to improve going
    forward. Maybe in particular in the fuzzing department. (If you’re looking for
    somewhere to contribute to curl, there’s your answer!)

    coverage a while back without even noticing – which we of course immediately rectified.
    When fixed, we fortunately did not get an explosion in issues (phew!), which thus
    confirmed that we had not messed up in any particular way while the fuzzing ability
    had been limited. But still: several man weeks of professional code inspection
    and no serious flaws were detected. I am thrilled over this fact.'

- en: Because of curl’s use of third party libraries for doing QUIC and HTTP/3, the
    report advises that there should be follow-up audits of the involved libraries.
    Fair proposal, but that is of course something that is beyond what we as a project
    can do.

    Dan Fandrich for participating in the process.

- en: This is (quite fittingly since it is for HTTP/3) the third external security
    audit performed on curl source code, even if this was more limited in scope than
    the previous ones done in 2016 and 2022\. Quite becomingly, the amount of detected
    important issues have decreased for every new audit. We love scrutiny and we take
    security seriously. I think this shows in the audit reports.
