- en: WASHINGTON—Today, the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement
    Network (FinCEN) issued a [Notice of Proposed Rulemaking](https://www.federalregister.gov/public-inspection/2024-02565/anti-money-laundering-regulations-for-residential-real-estate-transfers) to
    combat and deter money laundering in the U.S. residential real estate sector by
    increasing transparency.

- en: The proposed rule would require certain professionals involved in real estate
    closings and settlements to report information to FinCEN about non-financed transfers
    of residential real estate to legal entities or trusts. FinCEN’s proposal is tailored
    to target residential real estate transfers considered to be high-risk for money
    laundering, while minimizing potential business burden, and it would not require
    reporting of transfers made to individuals.

    and hide the proceeds of serious crimes with anonymity, while law-abiding Americans
    bear the cost of inflated housing prices,” said FinCEN Director Andrea Gacki.
    “Today marks an important step toward not only curbing abuse of the U.S. residential
    real estate sector, but safeguarding our economic and national security.”

- en: The proposed rule describes the circumstances in which a report would be filed;
    who would file a report; what information would need to be provided, including
    information about the beneficial owners of the legal entities and trusts; and
    when a report about the transaction would be due. Data from the reports would
    assist the Department of the Treasury and its law enforcement and national security
    partners in addressing vulnerabilities that leave the U.S. residential real estate
    market exposed to abuse by illicit actors.

- en: The proposed rule is consistent with the Bank Secrecy Act’s longstanding directive
    to extend anti-money laundering measures to the real estate sector and builds
    on the success of FinCEN’s Real Estate Geographic Targeting Order program, which
    has demonstrated the need for increased transparency and further regulation of
    this sector nationwide. Under the proposed rule, persons involved in real estate
    closings and settlements would continue to be exempt from the anti-money laundering
    compliance program requirements of the Bank Secrecy Act.
