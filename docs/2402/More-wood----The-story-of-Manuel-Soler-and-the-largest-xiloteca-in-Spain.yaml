    "Les Rotes"), a few meters from the sea, is a large plot of those that still respect
    the vegetation of the place. Where you can glimpse what in other times was the
    area, which has now been taken over by cement. **Large and leafy trees among which
    Manuel Soler lives**, in an idyllic fairytale cabin that he built himself a short
    distance from his most precious treasure. Despite the ignorance of most of the
    neighbors, at the back of the plot, in another wooden house that also came out
    of their hands, the largest xiloteca in Spain is hidden.

    went to the bottom where, in a wooden cabin, with the poster announcing *Xylotheque*
    Next to the door, Manuel and his dog Caco were waiting for us. **Inside we find
    a room full of shelves** in which, instead of books, thousands of perfectly labeled
    woods are displayed. That was *xilo*Excuse me, and this is the story of Manuel,
    which is necessary to know to understand the reason for his collection.

    was **captain of the merchant navy for 38 years**. He transported a wide variety
    of goods, from oil to, on one occasion, 3 elephants that he took to Seville for
    the Circo Price, he remembers with amusement. But the vast majority of trips were
    made **transporting ammonia**, which forced him to rely on strict medication for
    exposure, which, as he himself says, *"It was almost worse than the disease"*
    since it caused loss of vision to a large part of the crew.

    Manuel tells us how he had to endure different **boarding attempts on their way
    through Nigeria**. On one occasion, an assailant managed to sneak into his ship
    through the broom, which is the opening in the hull through which the anchor chain
    passes. Luckily, they detected him and quickly arrested him. *"They gave him several
    slaps and blows and he jumped off the boat"*, leaving behind his knife that Manuel
    still keeps today. But he also explains that other boats were not so lucky, because
    on several occasions **they retained colleagues**, even going so far as to assassinate
    the captains after managing to get hold of the keys to the rooms where they kept
    the material and cargo.

    and partly due to the aforementioned problems suffered by those who transported
    substances such as ammonia, for which they were later "compensated" by reducing
    their working life. And he does it in Dénia, on the plot described at the beginning,
    despite being **native of Swedish**. She decided to move to live in the [Marina
    Alta](https://lamarinaalta.com/ "Marina Alta") after spending long permits with
    a fellow camper in Les Rotes, when it was still “forest”. That led him to appreciate
    the landscape and peace that the place breathes, for which he decided to acquire
    a piece of the area.

    when in one of his jobs in Nigeria **some Italians gave him 6 samples**. They
    were perfectly cut wooden rectangles so that their qualities could be better appreciated.
    But he stayed there until another day, once retired, making a piece of furniture
    in the place where he now lives, **carved an identical piece** to the court of
    those Italians. *"There the bug woke me up and I began to be interested in knowing
    all types of wood and bringing them home"*.

    trips on purpose to get precious samples that he could only find there. On one
    of those trips, to Cuba on that occasion, **He got rid of all the clothes he was
    carrying to return with the suitcase loaded with new purchases** for your xiloteca.
    *"More wood!"*laughs Manuel. He also involved his acquaintances so that on his
    travels they would get him a copy that he did not have then.

    work that began alone, although it influenced many pupils who now have their own
    xilotecas in different parts of Spain. But none with as many specimens as Manuel's,
    despite the fact that, unlike other collectors in the country, it has never received
    the help of any administration.

    de Dénia***, using its collection as a tourist attraction. After that, in a visit
    he received from a group of tourists with a person in charge of the City Council,
    Manuel could not take it any longer, making it clear: *"This is Manuel''s xiloteca,
    not Dénia''s xiloteca, that here no one has put a hard part apart from me!"*.'

    the great experts in the field. His collection and his knowledge acquired over

    me to take it and admire, above all, the size. One meter measures. *"It's not
    that bad either"*, I think. He tells me that this is what this species grows every
    day, how much it is so that if you sit down to observe it you can see how it is

    of a boat. I suspect that wood comes from there, but history still gives for more.
    The glacier was in **mount ararat**, which borders between Turkey, Armenia and
    Iran. It is 5.180 meters high and the boat was found under the ice near the summit.

    research centers in Cairo, Bordeaux, Paris and Madrid. In this investigation it
    was discovered that the wood was from White Oak, a species that does not exist
    today. But the most shocking thing is that it was estimated that **its age was
    about 5.000 years**. Time of the Universal Flood. Manuel doesn't say it, being
    even a bit skeptical, but he forces me to join the strings until a name comes
    up in the conversation with which the boat can be known today. The one with the
    most famous ark, owned by the most famous Noah.

    a hard and heavy wood with which it lived during its long life at sea. It was
    used to manufacture the bearings for the shafts of the propellers of the boats.
    All the ships in which he sailed carried it, so it is not surprising that he had
    a special fixation for that piece of wood that is now exhibited in his xiloteca.'
