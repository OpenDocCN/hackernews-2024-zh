- en: bloop's automatic code translation solution automates the menial task of moving
    code between a source and target language. Traditional approaches to this problem
    result in code that is unreadable, and the alternative of rewriting a system from
    scratch is unfeasibly expensive for many projects. We're pioneering a novel approach
    to this age-old problem, building on our expertise in solving coding problems
    with LLMs.

    software development, won Product Hunt’s Product of the Day, and raised our seed
    funding round from leading investors including Y Combinator (S21), Khosla Ventures,
    Sands Capital and LocalGlobe.

- en: We're automating code translation between two programming languages. To do this
    we're developing pipelines that utilise source to source compilers and LLMs that
    can scale to support massive amounts of code.

- en: You'll work at the heart of this, collaborating with a small, talented team
    to design and implement the core engine that powers the pipeline. You'll work
    on the forefront of compilers, automated testing, LLMs (training and local inference)
    and static analysis.
