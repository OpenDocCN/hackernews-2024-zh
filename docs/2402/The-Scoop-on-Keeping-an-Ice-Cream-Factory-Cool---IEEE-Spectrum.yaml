    dessert. For control systems engineer [Patryk Borkowski](https://www.linkedin.com/in/patryk-borkowski-5a1589231/?originalSubdomain=uk),
    a job at the biggest ice cream company in the world is also a great way to put
    his automation expertise to use.

    and engineers use this small-scale factory to experiment with new ice cream formulations
    and novel production methods.

    ice cream products make for fascinating problem-solving. Much of Borkowski’s work
    involves improving the environmental impact of ice cream production by cutting
    waste and reducing the amount of energy needed to keep products frozen.

    not allowed to discuss many of the details of his research, he says one of the
    projects he has worked on is a modular manufacturing line that the company uses
    to develop new kinds of ice cream. The setup allows pieces of equipment such as
    sauce baths, nitrogen baths for quickly freezing layers, and chocolate deposition
    systems to be seamlessly switched in and out so that food scientists can experiment
    and create new products.

    because it’s inherently unstable. “Ice cream doesn’t want to be frozen; it pretty
    much wants to be melted on the floor,” he says. “We’re trying to bend the chemistry
    to bind all the ingredients into a semistable mixture that gives you that great
    taste and feeling on the tongue.”

    targeting sustainability across the company, so cutting waste and improving energy
    efficiency are key. He recently helped develop a testing rig to simulate freezer
    doors being repeatedly opened and closed in shops. This helped collect temperature
    data that was used to design new freezers that run at higher temperatures to save
    electricity.

    in Hellendoorn, Netherlands, to uncover inefficiencies in the production process.
    He built a system that collected and collated operational data from all the factory’s
    machines to identify the causes of stoppages and waste.

    manufacturers. Also, they ran legacy code written in Dutch—a language Borkowski
    doesn’t speak.

    systems, then reprogrammed them to communicate with the new data-collection system.
    Now the data-collection system can be easily adapted to work at any Unilever factory.

    indicate that he would become an engineer. At school, he loved writing, drawing,
    and learning new languages. He imagined himself having a career in the creative
    industries.

    quickly discovered online communities for technology enthusiasts and began learning

    attend a technical high school, pursuing a technical diploma in electronics and
    learning about components, soldering, and assembly language. In 2011, he enrolled
    at the [West Pomeranian University of Technology](https://www.zut.edu.pl/uczelnia/aktualnosci.html)
    in Szczecin, Poland, where he earned a bachelor’s degree in automation and [robotics.](https://spectrum.ieee.org/topic/robotics/)

    skills to use, so he moved to London. There, Borkowski initially worked odd jobs
    in warehouses and production facilities. After a brief stint as an electronic
    technician assembling ultrasonic scanners, he joined bakery company [Brioche Pasquier](https://www.pasquier.fr/en_uk/)
    in Milton Keynes, England, as an automation engineer.

    engineering, the discipline he’d always wanted to pursue. Part of his duties involved
    daily maintenance, but he also joined a team building new production lines from
    the ground up, linking together machinery such as mixers, industrial ovens, coolers,
    and packaging units. They programmed the machines so they all worked together
    seamlessly without human intervention.

    down, Borkowski says. There seemed to be little opportunity to advance his career
    at Brioche Pasquier, so he applied for the control systems job at Unilever.

    but a degree in subjects like automation or robotics provides an important theoretical
    foundation.

    calm, which he admits can be difficult when a manager is pressuring you to quickly
