- en: A network of at least 123 websites operated from within the People’s Republic
    of China while posing as local news outlets in 30 countries across Europe, Asia,
    and Latin America, disseminates pro-Beijing disinformation and ad hominem attacks
    within much larger volumes of commercial press releases. We name this campaign
    PAPERWALL.

    on in 2022 by the cybersecurity company Mandiant. However, we assess PAPERWALL
    to be a distinct campaign with different operators and unique techniques, tactics
    and procedures.

    service that was previously linked to HaiEnergy. We found evidence that Times
    Newswire regularly seeds pro-Beijing political content, including ad hominem attacks,
    by concealing it within large amounts of seemingly benign commercial content.

    the ephemeral nature of its most aggressive components, whereby articles attacking

    activities in the spheres of influence operations (IOs), both online and [offline](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2023/09/21/china-global-influence-takeaways/).
    In the online realm, relevant to the findings in this report, Chinese IOs are
    [shifting](https://query.prod.cms.rt.microsoft.com/cms/api/am/binary/RW1aFyW)
    their tactics and increasing their volume of activity. For example, in November
    2023 Meta – owner of the social media platforms Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp
    – announced the removal of five networks engaging in “coordinated inauthentic
    behavior” (i.e. influence operations) and targeting foreign audiences. Meta [noted](https://transparency.fb.com/en-gb/integrity-reports-q3-2023/)
    it as a **marked increase in IO activity by China**, stating that “for comparison,
    between 2017 and November 2020, we took down two CIB networks from China, and
    both mainly focused on the Asia-Pacific region. This represents the most notable
    change in the threat landscape, when compared with the 2020 [US] election cycle.”

    harmful consequences** for the targeted individuals, especially when, as in PAPERWALL’s
    case, it happens within much larger amounts of ostensibly benign news or promotional
    content that lends credibility to and expands the reach of the attacks. The consequences
    to these individuals can include, but are not limited to, their delegitimization
    in the country that hosts them; the loss of professional opportunities; and even
    verbal or physical harassment and intimidation by communities sympathetic to the
    Chinese government’s agenda.

    of the increasingly important role played by **private firms in the management
    of digital IOs** on behalf of the Chinese government. For example, an October
    2023 [blog post](https://www.rand.org/pubs/commentary/2023/10/dismantling-the-disinformation-business-of-chinese.html)
    by the RAND corporation summarized recent public findings on this issue, and advocated
    for the disruption of the disinformation-for-hire industry through the use of
    sanctions or other available legal and policy means.

    not ideology,** tend not to be discerning about the motivations of their clients.
    As major [recent press investigations have shown](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/feb/15/revealed-disinformation-team-jorge-claim-meddling-elections-tal-hanan),
    both their origin and their client base can truly be global. Exposing this actor
    type, and its tactics, can help understand how governments seek plausible deniability
    through the hiring of corporate proxies. It can also refocus research on the latter,
    increasing deterrence by exposing their actions.

    audiences that did not correspond to any real newsrooms in Italy. Il Foglio’s

    on those domains were all similar in structure, layout, and content, with generic

    rumor maker”** could be found on every active PAPERWALL website as of December
    2023\. This article contains a direct attack on [Li-Meng Yan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Li-Meng_Yan),
    a Chinese virologist who alleges that the COVID-19 virus originated from a Chinese
    government laboratory. While her theories [have been widely dismissed](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/02/12/china-covid-misinformation-li-meng-yan/)

    most peculiar traits of the campaign. While there is certainly no definitive playbook
    on how online influence operations are conducted, it is uncommon for a network

    but equally covert source. For example, as seen in [other known disinformation
    campaigns](https://citizenlab.ca/2019/05/burned-after-reading-endless-mayflys-ephemeral-disinformation-campaign/),
    a typical tactic would be to create copycat domains, mimicking real news sources
    without revealing where the content was first published. This characteristic makes

    ephemeral disinformation is designed to elude detection. With the evidence disappearing
    from the source websites not long after having been published, investigators may
    be unable to make the necessary connections to detect an influence operation or
    correctly identify the reach and depth of the operation. At the same time, the

    packages. Each of the packages exclusively listed PAPERWALL domains as the “major
    local media” on which paid editorial content could be placed.

    websites posing as local news outlets while pushing both commercial and political
    content aligned with Beijing’s views to a variety of European, Asian, and Latin
    American audiences.

- en: The campaign is an example of a **sprawling influence operation** serving both
    financial and political interests, and **in alignment with Beijing’s political
    agenda**. By observing the minimal traffic towards the network’s websites that
    is measurable through open source tools[²](#fn2), and the lack of visible mainstream
    media coverage (including on news aggregators, such as for example Google News)
    or social media amplification, we can assess the **impact of the campaign as negligible
    so far**.

    content wrapping the aggressively political one within the PAPERWALL network,
    should not be taken to indicate that such a campaign is harmless. Seeding pieces
    of disinformation and targeted attacks within much larger quantities of irrelevant
    or even unpopular content is a [known modus operandi in the context of influence
    operations](https://secondaryinfektion.org/), which can eventually pay enormous
    dividends once one of those fragments is eventually picked up and legitimized
    by mainstream press or [political figures](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/dec/07/russia-involved-in-leak-of-papers-saying-nhs-is-for-sale-says-reddit).

    operations is [hardly news](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influence-for-hire).
    However, since the early days of [research](https://www.timesofisrael.com/who-is-behind-israels-archimedes-group-banned-by-facebook-for-election-fakery/)
    in this space, the disinformation-for-hire industry has [boomed](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/25/world/europe/disinformation-social-media.html),
    leading to findings and disruptions in countries around the world (for a few examples,
    in [Myanmar](https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/October-2020-CIB-Report.pdf),
    [Brazil](https://medium.com/dfrlab/facebook-removes-assets-connected-to-brazilian-marketing-firms-56ccefadd653),
    the [UAE, Egypt and Saudi Arabia](https://about.fb.com/news/2019/08/cib-uae-egypt-saudi-arabia/)).
    China – previously [exposed](https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/aug/30/meta-facebook-instagram-shuts-down-spamouflage-network-china-foreign-influence#:~:text=which%20at%20times%20appeared%20to%20collaborate%20with%20private%20Chinese%20companies.)
    for having resorted to this proxy category in large influence operations, including
    the cited [HaiEnergy](https://www.mandiant.com/resources/blog/pro-prc-information-operations-campaign-haienergy)
    – is now increasingly benefiting from this operating model, which maintains a
    thin veil of plausible deniability, while ensuring a broad dissemination of the
    political messaging. It is safe to assume that PAPERWALL will not be the last
    example of a partnership between private sector and government in the context
    of Chinese influence operations.
