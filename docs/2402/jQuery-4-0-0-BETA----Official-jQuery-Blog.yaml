- en: jQuery 4.0.0 has been in the works for a *long* time, but it is now ready for
    a beta release! There’s a lot to cover, and the team is excited to see it released.
    We’ve got bug fixes, performance improvements, and some breaking changes. We removed
    support for IE<11 after all! Still, we expect disruption to be minimal.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Many of the breaking changes are ones the team has wanted to make for years,
    but couldn’t in a patch or minor release. We’ve trimmed legacy code, removed some
    previously-deprecated APIs, removed some internal-only parameters to public functions
    that were never documented, and dropped support for some “magic” behaviors that
    were overly complicated.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We will publish a comprehensive upgrade guide before final release, to outline
    the removed code and how to migrate. The [jQuery Migrate plugin](https://github.com/jquery/jquery-migrate)
    will also be ready to assist. For now, please try out the beta release and [let
    us know if you encounter any issues](https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As usual, the release is available on [our CDN](https://jquery.com/download/)
    and the npm package manager. Third party CDNs will not be hosting this beta release,
    but will host the 4.0.0 final release later. Here are some highlights for jQuery
    4.0.0 beta.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: jQuery 4.0 drops support for IE 10 and older. Some may be asking why we didn’t
    remove support for IE 11\. We plan to remove support in stages, and the next step
    [will be released in jQuery 5.0](https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/5077).
    For now, we’ll start by removing code specifically supporting IE versions older
    than 11, giving us a size reduction of [-867 gzipped bytes in one PR](https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/4347)!
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We also dropped support for other very old browsers, including Edge Legacy,
    iOS <11, Firefox <65, and Android Browser. No changes should be required on your
    end. If you need to support any of these browsers, simply stick with jQuery 3.x.

    other jQuery methods and were always meant for internal-use only. These methods
    are `push`, `sort`, and `splice`. We switched our uses of these methods to Array
    functions instead of the jQuery prototype. For example, `$elems.push( elem )`
    became `[].push.call( $elems, elem )`. We’re mentioning it here in case there
    are any plugins out there that may have relied on these methods.

    years ago, which makes this a breaking change. At least everyone is the on the

    which works in all browsers that jQuery 4.0 supports. This should help avoid unexpected
    behavior in case a developer is unaware that code can be executed from a remote

    The jQuery source has always been published with jQuery releases on npm and GitHub,
    but could not be imported directly as modules without [RequireJS](https://requirejs.org/),
    which was jQuery’s build tool of choice. We have since switched to [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org/introduction/)
    for packaging jQuery and we do run all tests on the ES modules separately.

    to maintain attributes such as `crossdomain`, we have [since switched most asynchronous
    script requests to use <script> tags](https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/4763)
    to avoid any CSP errors caused by using inline scripts. There are still a few
    cases where XHR is used for asynchronous script requests, such as when the `"headers"`
    option is passed (use `scriptAttrs` instead!), but we now use a `<script>` tag
    whenever possible.

    and Callbacks (now below 20k bytes gzipped!). Deferreds have long-supported the
    [Promises A+ standard](https://promisesaplus.com/), so native Promises can be
    used instead in most cases and they are available in all of jQuery’s supported
    browsers except IE11\. Deferreds do have some extra features that native Promises
    do not support, but most usage can be migrated to Promise methods. If you need
    to support IE11, it’s best to use the main build or add a polyfill for native
    Promises.
