- en: jQuery 4.0.0 has been in the works for a *long* time, but it is now ready for
    a beta release! There’s a lot to cover, and the team is excited to see it released.
    We’ve got bug fixes, performance improvements, and some breaking changes. We removed
    support for IE<11 after all! Still, we expect disruption to be minimal.
  id: totrans-split-8
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Many of the breaking changes are ones the team has wanted to make for years,
    but couldn’t in a patch or minor release. We’ve trimmed legacy code, removed some
    previously-deprecated APIs, removed some internal-only parameters to public functions
    that were never documented, and dropped support for some “magic” behaviors that
    were overly complicated.

    the removed code and how to migrate. The [jQuery Migrate plugin](https://github.com/jquery/jquery-migrate)

    us know if you encounter any issues](https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues).

    4.0.0 beta.

    remove support for IE 11\. We plan to remove support in stages, and the next step
    [will be released in jQuery 5.0](https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/5077).
    For now, we’ll start by removing code specifically supporting IE versions older
    than 11, giving us a size reduction of [-867 gzipped bytes in one PR](https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/4347)!

    other jQuery methods and were always meant for internal-use only. These methods

    functions instead of the jQuery prototype. For example, `$elems.push( elem )`
    became `[].push.call( $elems, elem )`. We’re mentioning it here in case there
    are any plugins out there that may have relied on these methods.

    years ago, which makes this a breaking change. At least everyone is the on the

    [Promises A+ standard](https://promisesaplus.com/), so native Promises can be
    used instead in most cases and they are available in all of jQuery’s supported
    browsers except IE11\. Deferreds do have some extra features that native Promises
    do not support, but most usage can be migrated to Promise methods. If you need
    to support IE11, it’s best to use the main build or add a polyfill for native
    Promises.
