    them is too passive.

- en: Moreover, notes are often incomplete or sketchy; just reading such notes won't
    help. And a few days or months after you take them, they may very well be illegible
    or incomprehensible. Finally, if you don't do something active with your notes,
    you run the risks of having unorganized notes or of misplacing them.

- en: For each class, buy a separate notebook from the one you take your notes in.
    I recommend a "composition" or spiral notebook, not a looseleaf notebook, for
    your "permanent" (i.e., re-written) notes.

    copy your notes into your permanent notebook.

- en: The main idea behind re-writing your "raw" class notes (besides making them
    more legible and organized) is that the very act of copying them is one of the
    best ways of studying them! Further study of your class notes can then be done
    from these "cooked" ones that are neater, more legible, more organized, and more
    complete. I will suggest ways to do this [later](https://cse.buffalo.edu/~rapaport/howtostudy.html#examstudy).

    in mind. You may find that you have questions, perhaps something you missed or
    don't understand, or even a "substantive" question. If so, good! Make a note of
    your question and ask it in class next time!

    fashion. You could write your permanent notes in an outline form if that seems
    suitable: You don''t have to follow any "official" or formal outlining style (e.g.,
    using the I.A.1.(a)(i) format or the (sometimes silly) rule that there must always
    be at least two subsections, never just one) — after all, these are *your* notes.
    Personally, I like to number main ideas (and separate them with a line), using
    an "indented bullet" style for details:'
