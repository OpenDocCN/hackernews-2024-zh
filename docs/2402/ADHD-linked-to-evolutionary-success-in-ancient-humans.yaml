- en: While current diagnostic definitions of [attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder](https://newatlas.com/tag/adhd/)
    (ADHD) are relatively new, the general condition has been identified by clinicians
    under a variety of names for centuries. Recent genetic studies have revealed the
    condition to be highly heritable, meaning the majority of those with the condition
    have genetically inherited it from their parents.

- en: Depending on diagnostic criteria, anywhere from two to 16% of children can be
    classified as having ADHD. In fact, increasing rates of diagnosis over recent
    years have led to some clinicians arguing the condition is overdiagnosed.

- en: What is relatively clear, however, is that the behavioural characteristics that
    underpin ADHD have been genetically present in human populations for potentially
    quite a long time. And that has led some researchers to wonder what the condition's
    evolutionary benefits could be.

    across a field full of one kind of fruit and everyone is faced with a big question.
    Do you settle in the field and exploit the fruit stocks until they are all gone,
    or do you quickly take what you can and continue to explore for more varied foods?

    is fundamental to the survival of all animals. At what point is the risk of staying
    in one place greater than the risk of moving on to find out what is over the next
    hill?'

- en: In the early 2000s a team of scientists set out to [study the genetics of a
    unique tribe of people](https://bmcecolevol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2148-8-173#Abs1)
    in Northern Kenya. Known as the Ariaal, this population has traditionally been
    incredibly nomadic. Some members of the Ariaal settled down in one place over
    the 20th century and adopted modern methods of agriculture while other tribe members
    continued to live as nomadic pastoralists.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The scientists compared the genetic and health differences between these two
    cohorts of Ariaal and discovered something incredibly interesting. Generally,
    all of the Ariaal people carried a unique genetic mutation, dubbed DRD4/7R. This
    genetic trait had previously been identified commonly in people with ADHD.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In modern children diagnosed with ADHD, the genetic mutation generally correlates
    with restlessness and distractibility. And in those Ariaal children who had settled
    into sedentary Western behaviours, the gene was linked to poor health and distracted
    classroom behaviours. But in those Ariaal who still practised a traditional nomadic
    life, the gene mutation was linked to strength and better nutritional health.

    and ADHD symptoms,” [explained study leader Dan Eisenberg](https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/648099)
    back in 2008\. “It is possible that in the nomadic setting, a boy with this allele
    might be able to more effectively defend livestock against raiders or locate food
    and water sources, but that the same tendencies might not be as beneficial in
    settled pursuits such as focusing in school, farming or selling goods.”'

    beneficial to a tribe by pushing some people to be 'explorers'? What manifests
    in modern times as fidgety restlessness could actually have been useful to tribes
    foraging the countryside for food.

- en: David Barack, from the University of Pennsylvania, along with a team of colleagues
    set out to empirically test that hypothesis. They produced a unique game where
    players were given eight minutes to collect as many berries as possible by hovering
    a mouse pointer over a bush. Each time they foraged from the same bush a player’s
    harvest would slightly decline but if they moved to a new bush they would suffer
    a time penalty.

    Or risk wasting time by trying another bush to see if it had more fruit? Explore
    or exploit?

- en: Around 450 people participated in the experiment, and all were simultaneously
    screened for ADHD symptoms. Unsurprisingly, the researchers found those with higher
    ADHD scores moved on to new bushes sooner than others but more importantly, those
    with ADHD also tended to collect higher volumes of berries overall.

- en: Writing in the newly published study, Barack and colleagues noted that participants
    without ADHD characteristics tended to over-harvest single patches. Looking at
    what would be an optimal harvest strategy for the game it was discovered that
    players with high ADHD scores were more successful overall.

- en: “In addition, we discovered that participants that screened positive for ADHD
    more readily abandoned patches and achieved higher reward rates than did participants
    who screened negative,” the researchers concluded. “Given the over-staying displayed
    by participants overall, those with elevated ASRS scores made exploratory decisions
    that were more closely aligned with the predictions of optimal foraging theory,
    and, in this sense, behaved more optimally.”

- en: The findings are in no way a final word on the possible evolutionary benefits
    of ADHD. But they do offer a compelling and plausible reason why a small percentage
    of humans continue to carry these traits. In the 21st century we may have pathologized
    ADHD as a negative disorder, but that could be just because these characteristics
    simply don’t easily suit the world we have constructed. In a different context,
    it is possible that someone with ADHD could be a saviour to a tribe by restlessly
    exploring new pastures.
