- en: While current diagnostic definitions of [attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder](https://newatlas.com/tag/adhd/)
    (ADHD) are relatively new, the general condition has been identified by clinicians
    under a variety of names for centuries. Recent genetic studies have revealed the
    condition to be highly heritable, meaning the majority of those with the condition
    have genetically inherited it from their parents.

  zh: 尽管当前对[注意力缺陷多动障碍](https://newatlas.com/tag/adhd/)（ADHD）的诊断定义相对较新，但临床医生几个世纪以来一直以各种名称识别这种一般病情。最近的遗传学研究揭示了这种情况具有高度遗传性，这意味着大多数患有该病情的人是从父母那里遗传到的。
- en: Depending on diagnostic criteria, anywhere from two to 16% of children can be
    classified as having ADHD. In fact, increasing rates of diagnosis over recent
    years have led to some clinicians arguing the condition is overdiagnosed.

- en: What is relatively clear, however, is that the behavioural characteristics that
    underpin ADHD have been genetically present in human populations for potentially
    quite a long time. And that has led some researchers to wonder what the condition's
    evolutionary benefits could be.

    across a field full of one kind of fruit and everyone is faced with a big question.

    unique tribe of people](https://bmcecolevol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2148-8-173#Abs1)
    in Northern Kenya. Known as the Ariaal, this population has traditionally been
    incredibly nomadic. Some members of the Ariaal settled down in one place over
    the 20th century and adopted modern methods of agriculture while other tribe members
    continued to live as nomadic pastoralists.

  zh: 在21世纪初，一队科学家开始研究肯尼亚北部一个独特部落的基因学。这个部落被称为阿利亚尔，传统上一直是游牧生活。一些阿利亚尔成员在20世纪定居在一个地方，并采用现代农业方法，而其他部落成员继续过着游牧的牧民生活。
- en: The scientists compared the genetic and health differences between these two
    cohorts of Ariaal and discovered something incredibly interesting. Generally,
    all of the Ariaal people carried a unique genetic mutation, dubbed DRD4/7R. This
    genetic trait had previously been identified commonly in people with ADHD.

  zh: 科学家比较了这
- en: In modern children diagnosed with ADHD, the genetic mutation generally correlates
    with restlessness and distractibility. And in those Ariaal children who had settled
    into sedentary Western behaviours, the gene was linked to poor health and distracted
    classroom behaviours. But in those Ariaal who still practised a traditional nomadic
    life, the gene mutation was linked to strength and better nutritional health.

  zh: 在被诊断为 ADHD 的现代儿童中，基因突变通常与坐立不安和分心相关。而在那些已经采用了西方定居行为的阿利亚尔儿童中，这种基因与健康状况不佳和分心的课堂行为相关。但是在那些仍然保持传统游牧生活的阿利亚尔人中，这种基因突变与力量和更好的营养健康相关。
- en: '"The DRD4/7R allele has been linked to greater food and drug cravings, novelty-seeking,
    and ADHD symptoms,” [explained study leader Dan Eisenberg](https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/648099)
    back in 2008\. “It is possible that in the nomadic setting, a boy with this allele
    might be able to more effectively defend livestock against raiders or locate food
    and water sources, but that the same tendencies might not be as beneficial in
    settled pursuits such as focusing in school, farming or selling goods.”'

  zh: “DRD4/7R等位基因已与更强烈的食物和药物渴望、寻新和 ADHD 症状相关联，”2008年的研究负责人丹·艾森伯格解释道。“在游牧环境中，拥有这种等位基因的男孩可能能够更有效地保卫牲畜免受袭击者的袭击或找到食物和水源，但是这种倾向在专注于学业、农业或售卖商品等已定居的追求中可能不那么有益。”
- en: So a fascinating hypothesis emerged. Could the genetic traits of ADHD be somewhat
    beneficial to a tribe by pushing some people to be 'explorers'? What manifests
    in modern times as fidgety restlessness could actually have been useful to tribes
    foraging the countryside for food.

- en: David Barack, from the University of Pennsylvania, along with a team of colleagues
    set out to empirically test that hypothesis. They produced a unique game where
    players were given eight minutes to collect as many berries as possible by hovering
    a mouse pointer over a bush. Each time they foraged from the same bush a player’s
    harvest would slightly decline but if they moved to a new bush they would suffer
    a time penalty.

  zh: 大卫·巴拉克（David Barack），来自宾夕法尼亚大学，与一队同事共同着手实证测试这一假设。他们设计了一款独特的游戏，在游戏中玩家被赋予八分钟的时间，通过将鼠标指针悬停在灌木上来收集尽可能多的浆果。每次从同一灌木中采集食物时，玩家的收获都会略微减少，但如果他们移动到新的灌木上，则会遭受时间惩罚。
- en: So what would most players do? Stick to the same reliable berry-supplying bush?
    Or risk wasting time by trying another bush to see if it had more fruit? Explore

  zh: 那么，大多数玩家会做什么呢？坚持选择同一个可靠的供应浆果的灌木？还是冒险浪费时间去尝试另一个灌木，看看它是否有更多的果实？探索还是利用？
- en: Around 450 people participated in the experiment, and all were simultaneously
    screened for ADHD symptoms. Unsurprisingly, the researchers found those with higher
    ADHD scores moved on to new bushes sooner than others but more importantly, those
    with ADHD also tended to collect higher volumes of berries overall.

  zh: 大约有450人参与了这项实验，并且所有人同时接受了ADHD症状筛查。毫不奇怪，研究人员发现，ADHD分数较高的人比其他人更早地转移到了新的灌木上，但更重要的是，那些患有ADHD的人也倾向于总体上收集更多的浆果。
- en: Writing in the newly published study, Barack and colleagues noted that participants
    without ADHD characteristics tended to over-harvest single patches. Looking at
    what would be an optimal harvest strategy for the game it was discovered that
    players with high ADHD scores were more successful overall.

  zh: 在新近发表的研究中，巴拉克和同事们指出，没有ADHD特征的参与者往往会过度采摘单一区域。研究了游戏的最佳收获策略后发现，ADHD分数较高的玩家整体上更成功。
- en: “In addition, we discovered that participants that screened positive for ADHD
    more readily abandoned patches and achieved higher reward rates than did participants
    who screened negative,” the researchers concluded. “Given the over-staying displayed
    by participants overall, those with elevated ASRS scores made exploratory decisions
    that were more closely aligned with the predictions of optimal foraging theory,
    and, in this sense, behaved more optimally.”

  zh: “此外，我们发现，筛选出ADHD阳性的参与者更容易放弃已经探索的区域，并获得更高的奖励率，而ADHD阴性的参与者则相反，”研究人员总结道。“考虑到参与者总体上表现出的过度停留，那些具有较高ASRS分数的人做出了更符合最佳觅食理论预测的探索性决策，在这个意义上，表现更为优越。”
- en: The findings are in no way a final word on the possible evolutionary benefits
    of ADHD. But they do offer a compelling and plausible reason why a small percentage
    of humans continue to carry these traits. In the 21st century we may have pathologized
    ADHD as a negative disorder, but that could be just because these characteristics
    simply don’t easily suit the world we have constructed. In a different context,
    it is possible that someone with ADHD could be a saviour to a tribe by restlessly
    exploring new pastures.

  zh: 这些发现绝不是对ADHD可能的进化益处的最终结论。但它们确实提供了一个引人入胜且合理的理由，解释为什么有一小部分人类继续保留这些特征。在21世纪，我们可能将ADHD病理化为一种负面障碍，但这可能只是因为这些特征根本不适合我们构建的世界。在不同的背景下，患有ADHD的人可能通过不停地探索新的牧场成为部落的救世主。
