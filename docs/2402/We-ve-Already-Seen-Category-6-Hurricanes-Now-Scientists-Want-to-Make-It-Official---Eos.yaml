    category 5 threshold, causing thousands of fatalities and billions of dollars
    of damage. Such ultrastrong, highly destructive hurricanes are becoming more likely
    as climate change increases the amount of energy available to storms.

    in the *Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of
    America*, scientists suggest that the growing intensification of tropical cyclones
    may necessitate adding a sixth category to the [Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind
    Scale](https://www.weather.gov/hgx/tropical_scale). Doing so could be one useful
    tool not only to indicate hurricane risk but also to convey the increasing dangers
    of climate change.

    ranking storms from “tropical depression,” at wind speeds less than 38 miles per
    hour (61 kilometers per hour), to “category 5 hurricane,” at wind speeds greater
    than 157 miles per hour (253 kilometers per hour).

    as the world warms, the authors wrote. They suggest a sixth category that encompasses
    storms with winds greater than 192 miles per hour (309 kilometers per hour).

- en: The authors used three lines of evidence to support the creation of a sixth
    category. First, multiple storms have already spilled over into the hypothetical
    category 6\. [Typhoon Haiyan](https://www.climate.gov/news-features/understanding-climate/2013-state-climate-record-breaking-super-typhoon-haiyan),
    for example, made landfall in the Philippines in 2013 and had winds that reached
    195 miles per hour (314 kilometers per hour). Haiyan was the costliest storm ever
    to hit the country and one of the deadliest, causing more than 6,000 fatalities.
    In 2015, [Hurricane Patricia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Patricia)—considered
    the strongest hurricane ever recorded—brought winds of up to 215 miles per hour
    (346 kilometers per hour) to southwest Mexico.

    decades. That metric refers to the highest wind speeds that are possible on a
    given day given that day’s weather conditions. They found that in the Gulf of
    Mexico between 1979 and 2019, conditions were conducive to category 6 hurricanes
    about 10 days a year.

    and found that under each possible scenario, the risk of a category 6 hurricane
    increased. “Over the next decade, there will be category 6 [hurricanes],” said

    to [Michael Brennan](https://www.weather.gov/organization/michael-brennan), the
    director of NOAA’s National Hurricane Center (NHC). Most fatalities caused by
    hurricanes occur not from wind but from water, including storm surges and rain.

    include storm surge, wind, rainfall, tornadoes and rip currents, instead of the
    particular category of the storm,” he wrote in an email. “Category 5 on the Saffir-Simpson
    scale already captures ‘Catastrophic Damage’ from wind, so it’s not clear that
    there would be a need for another category even if storms were to get stronger.”

    requires a larger discussion, with input from social scientists, psychologists,
    emergency managers, and city planners, Kossin said. He said he hopes the idea
    of a hypothetical category 6 will spark more discussion of how to warn people
    about all hurricane-related risks, including wind, storm surge, and rainfall,
    as hurricanes continue to intensify.
