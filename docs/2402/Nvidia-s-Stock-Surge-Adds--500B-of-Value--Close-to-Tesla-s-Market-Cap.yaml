    value by $489 billion to $1.7 trillion at Monday's close. It's now threatening
    to overtake Amazon and Alphabet to become the third-most valuable US company after
    Microsoft and Apple.

    this year, slashing the EV maker's market value by $214 billion to $576 billion.
    That's only $86 billion more than Nvidia's market-cap gain in just over five weeks

    premarket trading on Tuesday. If those changes hold, the gap between Nvidia's
    year-to-date rise in market cap and Tesla's market value will shrink to less than

    speed and magnitude. Only about a dozen US public companies are worth more. Nvidia
    has added roughly a JPMorgan's ($504 billion) worth of value in under six weeks,
    and its gain exceeds the likes of Walmart ($454 billion) or Exxon ($406 billion)
    in size.
