- en: When Findaway Voices first appeared, it made it comparatively easy for independent
    authors to do audiobooks. Audio was still hard, mind you, but it was possible.

    And now, the [licensing terms have changed](https://my.findawayvoices.com/terms-of-use).

- en: Accordingly, you hereby grant Spotify a non-exclusive, transferable, sublicensable,
    royalty-free, fully paid, irrevocable, worldwide license to reproduce, make available,
    perform and display, translate, modify, create derivative works from (such as
    transcripts of User Content), distribute, and otherwise use any such User Content
    through any medium, whether alone or in combination with other Content or materials,
    in any manner and by any means, method or technology, whether now known or hereafter
    created, in connection with the Service, the promotion, advertising or marketing
    of the Service, and the operation of Spotify’s (and its successors’ and affiliates’)
    business, including for systems and products management, improvement and development,
    testing, training, modeling and implementation in connection with the Spotify
    Service. Where applicable and to the extent permitted under applicable law, you
    also agree to waive, and not to enforce, any “moral rights” or equivalent rights,
    such as your right to object to derogatory treatment of such User Content. Nothing
    in these Terms prohibits any use of User Content by Spotify that may be taken

- en: Spotify may now do anything they want with your audiobook. They will–not can,
    *will*–feed it to their AI system and use it to rip off your work. They specifically
    declare you can’t complain about derogatory uses. They can mix your book with
    work you find abhorrent and release it as a new product. They can use a speech
    recognition system and create a printed version of your book.

- en: I have one audiobook. I pulled it from distribution when the royalties problems
    started and I stopped getting paid. [That audiobook became exclusive to my store
    on 17 January 2023](https://www.tiltedwindmillpress.com/product/audiosbs/). It
    has fewer sales, but I’ve made more than I did in all the years before. (“But
    exposure,” some folks will say. People die of exposure.)

    to store your audio files and nothing else, the new terms apply. They have no
    automatic option to delete titles from their site. I just sent this email to their
    technical support.
