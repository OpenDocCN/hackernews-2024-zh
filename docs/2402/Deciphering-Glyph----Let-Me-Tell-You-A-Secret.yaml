    software infrastructure, streamlined cloud deployment, and open source strategy,
    among other nerdy things. I enjoy solving challenging, complex technical problems
    or contributing to the open source commons. On the best jobs, I get to do both.)

    trade.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    who have also done software consulting and have reflected versions of this experience
    back to me.

- en: Companies do not go looking for consulting when things are going great. This
    is particularly true when looking for high-level consulting on things like system
    architecture or strategy. Almost by definition, there’s a problem that I have
    been brought in to solve. Ideally, that problem is a technical challenge.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In the software industry, your team probably already has some software professionals
    with a variety of technical skills, and thus they know what to do with technical
    challenges. Which means that, as often as not, the problem is to do with *people*
    rather than technology, even it appears otherwise.

    team’s general problems, that consultant will need to gather some information.
    If I am that consultant and I start to suspect that the purported technology problem
    that you’ve got is in fact a people problem, here is the *secret technique* that
    I am going to use:'

    with the most senior IC ^(engineer that you have on your team. I will bring that
    pen and paper to the meeting. I will then ask one question:)

    I have begun to suspect that this meeting is necessary, 90 minutes is typically
    not enough time, and I will struggle to keep up. Even so, I will usually manage
    to capture the highlights.

    that meeting, I will read back a *very* lightly edited ^(version of the transcript
    of the previous meeting. This is then routinely praised as a keen strategic insight.)

    an oblique reference to any current or even recent client; if I’d had this meeting
    recently it would be pretty awkward to answer that “so, I read your blog…” email.
    ^(But talking about clients in this way, no matter how obfuscated and vague the
    description, is always a bit professionally risky. So why risk it?)
  prefs: []

- en: The thing is, I’m not a people manager. While I *can* do this kind of work,
    and I do not begrudge doing it if it is the thing that needs doing, I find it
    stressful and unfulfilling. I am a technology guy, not a people person. This is
    generally true of people who elect to go into technology consulting; we know where
    the management track is, and we didn’t pick it.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you are going to hire me for my highly specialized technical expertise, I
    want you to get the maximum value out of it. I know my value; my rates are not
    low, and I do not want clients to come away with the sense that I only had a couple
    of “obvious” meetings.
  prefs: []

- en: So the intended audience for this piece is potential clients, leaders of teams
    (or organizations, or companies) who have a general technology problem and are
    wondering if they need a consultant with my skill-set to help them fix it. Before
    you decide that your issue is the need to implement a complex distributed system
    consensus algorithm, check if that is really what’s at issue. Talk to your ICs,
    and — taking care to make sure they understand that you want honest feedback and
    that they are safe to offer it — ask them what problems your organization has.

- en: During this meeting it is important to *only listen*. Especially if you’re at
    a small company and you are regularly involved in the day-to-day operations, you
    might feel immediately defensive. Sit with that feeling, and process it later.
    Don’t unload your emotional state on an employee you have power over.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “Only listening” doesn’t exclusively mean “don’t push back”. You also shouldn’t
    be committing to fixing anything. While the information you are gathering in these
    meetings is extremely valuable, and you should probably act on more of it than
    you will initially want to, your ICs won’t have the full picture. They really
    may not understand why certain priorities are set the way they are. You’ll need
    to take *that* as feedback for improving internal comms rather than “fixing” the
    perceived problem, and you certainly don’t want to make empty promises.

- en: 'If you have these conversations directly, you can get something from it that
    no consultant can offer you: credibility. If you can actively listen, the conversation
    alone can improve morale. People like having their concerns heard. If, better
    still, you manage to make meaningful changes to *address* the concerns you’ve
    heard about, you can inspire true respect.'

- en: As a consultant, I’m going to be seen as some random guy wasting their time
    with a meeting. Even if you make the changes I recommend, it won’t resonate the
    same way as someone remembering that they *personally* told you what was wrong,
    and you took it seriously and fixed it.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Once you know what the problems are with your organization, and you’ve got solid
    technical understanding that you really *do* need that event-driven distributed
    systems consensus algorithm implemented using Twisted, I’m absolutely your guy.
