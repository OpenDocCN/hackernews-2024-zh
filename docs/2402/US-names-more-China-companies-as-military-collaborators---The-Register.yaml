    a dozen Chinese tech companies now being added to a list of entities claimed by
    the Department of Defense (DoD) to be working for the military.

    manufacturer Yangtze Memory Technologies Corp (YMTC), artificial intelligence
    outfits Yitu Technology and Beijing Megvii, Lidar developer Hesai Technology,
    drone maker Chengdu JOUAV, and NetPosa, a video monitoring company.

    on the [DoD list](https://media.defense.gov/2024/Jan/31/2003384819/-1/-1/0/1260H-LIST.PDF)
    [PDF] does not involve immediate restrictions for the companies involved. Inclusion,
    however, is likely to harm their reputation with any business partners and may
    warn US organizations away from having any dealings with them.

    more than a year ago, which means that US companies are not allowed to supply
    goods to the chipmaker without being issued a difficult-to-obtain license. The
    Chinese biz was [trying to raise fresh capital](https://www.theregister.com/2023/11/02/chip_wars_hit_ymtc/)
    last year after reportedly using up its cash reserves in efforts to adapt to the
    sanctions imposed by Washington.

    annually. The latest update to the Act also prohibits the DoD from contracting

    strategy that relies on a "military-civil fusion" approach to buy advanced tech
    and expertise developed by companies, universities, and research programs that
    appear to be civilian operations.

    fabless chip designer Loongson Technology is expecting its revenue for 2023 to
    be down 31 per cent year-on-year, leading to a loss of ¥310 million ($43.36 million),
    and AI accelerator Cambricon Technologies is also forecasting revenue to be down
    and a full-year loss of up to ¥924 million ($130 million).

    companies are on the Department of Commerce Entity List, which restricts their
    ability to source advanced tech from the US and their ability to sell to certain
