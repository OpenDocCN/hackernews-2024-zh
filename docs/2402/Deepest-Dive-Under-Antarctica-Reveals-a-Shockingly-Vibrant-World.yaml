- en: When we finally crawl or haul ourselves out of the freezing ocean, I lie prostrate
    on the ice, my brain too dulled to think about removing my gear, my skin hard
    and wrinkled, my lips, hands, and feet swollen and numb—then, as my body warms
    and the blood starts to flow again, the pain is at its worst. It’s so intense
    I find myself wishing my extremities were still frozen. After four weeks, I can’t
    feel my toes anymore, even in the warmth. It will take seven months after our
    return to Europe for my damaged nerves to recover.

    a sight to elate any photographer. At the very beginning of spring, after the
    long polar night, microscopic plankton have not yet begun to bloom and cloud the
    water. Under the floe it’s exceptionally clear, because there are so few particles
    to scatter the light. What little light there is wells down through the cracks
    or seal holes as if from streetlamps, casting a subtle glow over the underwater
    landscape.'

    live in East Antarctica, and no land mammals at all. You might think the seafloor
    too would be a desert. In fact, it’s a luxuriant garden, with roots in deep time.

- en: Antarctic marine life has been largely isolated from the rest of the planet
    for tens of millions of years, ever since the continent separated from the other
    continents and froze over. Since then the powerful Antarctic Circumpolar Current
    has swirled from west to east around Antarctica, creating a sharp temperature
    gradient that inhibits the spread of marine animals. The long isolation has allowed
    a tremendous diversity of species, unique to the region, to evolve on the seafloor.
