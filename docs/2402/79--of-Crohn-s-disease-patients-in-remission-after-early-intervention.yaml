- en: Giving an immunotherapy drug as soon as possible after diagnosis with Crohn’s
    disease significantly reduces complications, including the need for surgery by
    a factor of 10, a clinical study has found. Compared to conventional treatment,
    which favors delaying the use of advanced therapies, the results suggest re-thinking
    how the condition is treated.

- en: Falling under the umbrella of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), Crohn’s disease
    is a painful and disabling chronic disease characterized by flare-ups that can
    cause progressive bowel damage. The standard treatment for acute flareups is steroids
    to reduce inflammation. Advanced therapy, which includes immunotherapy drugs,
    isn’t usually given until after conventional treatments have failed. Despite treatment
    with the current regime, surgical resection of the bowel is still needed in 17%
    to 25% of patients within five years of diagnosis.

    examined the effectiveness of giving the immunotherapy drug infliximab earlier,
    as soon as possible after diagnosis. They employed what’s called a ‘top-down’
    strategy, meaning the drug was given straight after diagnosis regardless of the
    patient’s symptom severity.

    – and has likely been ticking for some time – in terms of damage happening to
    the bowel, so there’s a need to start on advanced therapy such as infliximab as
    soon as possible,” said Nuru Noor, the study’s lead author.

- en: Infliximab is a monoclonal antibody that enhances and improves the immune system
    by blocking tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), a protein cells produce during
    acute inflammation. The drug is injected intravenously into the bloodstream or
    under the skin. Although due to historical concerns about infliximab’s cost and
    side effects – including an increased risk of infection due to suppression of
    the immune system – the drug is currently only offered later in the disease’s
    course.

- en: The researchers enrolled 386 patients aged 16 to 80 with active Crohn’s disease
    diagnosed in the previous six months. All patients were given an eight-week course
    of oral steroids, and then randomized into one of two treatment groups and followed
    for a year. The ‘top-down’ group received early infliximab combined with an immune
    system-modulating drug, whereas the ‘accelerated step-up’ group received conventional
    therapy focused on treating flare-ups.

    treatment showed sustained steroid- and surgery-free remission, compared to 15%
    in the accelerated step-up group. The top-down group had fewer adverse events,
    including disease flare-ups and serious adverse events, than the accelerated step-up
    group. Ten participants in the accelerated step-up group required urgent abdominal
    surgery for their Crohn’s, versus one participant in the top-down group.'

- en: Two-thirds (67%) of top-down patients had no visible ulcers when they underwent
    an endoscopy camera test at the end of the trial. ‘Endoscopic remission’, as it’s
    known, is important as it’s consistently been associated with a decreased risk
    of later Crohn’s disease complications. Most previous clinical trials have considered
    a therapy ‘highly successful’ if 20% to 30% of patients achieved an endoscopic
    remission. To top it off, patients in the top-down group also reported a higher
    quality of life and fewer hospitalizations.

    years of diagnosis has been considered ‘early’ and an ‘accelerated step-up’ approach
    therefore ‘good enough’,” Noor said. “But our findings redefine what should be
    considered early treatment. We’ve shown that by treating earlier, we can achieve
    better outcomes for patients than have previously been reported.”

- en: Contrary to previous concerns, the researchers found no difference in the risk
    of serious infection between the two treatment groups, suggesting that infliximab
    was safe to give early. Moreover, infliximab is now available as a cheaper generic
    or ‘biosimilar’ drug in both the UK and the US. In Australia, treatment with the
    drug is subsidized through the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS).

- en: “Up until now, the view has been ‘Why would you use a more expensive treatment
    strategy and potentially over-treat people if there’s a chance they might do fine
    anyway?’” said Miles Parkes, corresponding author of the study. “We now know we
    can prevent the majority of adverse outcomes, including [the] need for urgent
    surgery, by providing a treatment strategy that is safe and becoming increasingly
    affordable.”

- en: While other anti-TNF drugs, such as adalimumab, work similarly to infliximab
    and are significantly cheaper, more research is needed to establish whether they’re
    clinically effective. The researchers are now analyzing the health economics to
    see whether the benefits of infliximab therapy outweigh its cost.
