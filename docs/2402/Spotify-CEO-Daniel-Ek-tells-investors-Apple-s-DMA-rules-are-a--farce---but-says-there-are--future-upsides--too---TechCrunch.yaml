- en: Spotify, a notable Apple critic, unsurprisingly came out swinging after Apple
    announced how it was complying with the EU’s new regulation, the Digital Markets
    Act, or DMA, [calling Apple’s plan “extortion” and a “complete and total farce](https://techcrunch.com/2024/01/26/spotify-calls-apples-dma-compliance-plan-extortion-and-a-complete-and-total-farce/).”
    But on its Q4 2023 earnings call with investors, Spotify CEO Daniel Ek took a
    more muted tone concerning the new law, saying that there’s no real downside to
    its business, from an investor standpoint, as companies can remain on their current
    terms with Apple, and in fact, there are potential “future upsides, that could
    be quite significant.”

    CEO丹尼尔·埃克在对新法律发表了更为温和的态度，称从投资者的角度来看，公司没有真正的下行风险，因为公司可以继续按照当前条款与苹果合作，事实上，还存在“未来的上行潜力，可能会相当显著”。

- en: Though Apple is complying with the letter of the law — which forces Apple to
    open up its app ecosystem to new app stores and other payment mechanisms — it’s
    definitely not complying with the spirit of the law, meant to foster greater competition.
    Instead, Apple’s complicated new terms involve a new Core Technology Fee, which
    requires developers to pay €0.50 for each first annual install per year over a
    1 million threshold, regardless of their distribution channel. It will also take
    a commission on digital goods and services that take place on a developer’s website
    within seven days of a user tapping through an in-app link for external purchases.

  zh: 尽管苹果在遵守法律的表面上 — 强制苹果向新的应用商店和其他支付机制开放其应用生态系统 — 它显然没有遵守旨在促进更大竞争的法律精神。相反，苹果复杂的新条款涉及一项新的核心技术费用，要求开发者每年的首次安装超过100万的阈值支付0.50欧元，无论其分发渠道如何。它还将对在用户点击应用内链接后七天内在开发者网站上进行的数字商品和服务收取佣金。
- en: Ek immediately blasted Apple on social media after its terms were announced,
    calling Apple’s solution a “masterclass in distortion” and warning that Spotify
    could “not afford these fees” if it wanted “to be a profitable company.”

- en: “I know that there initially was some questions about whether or not this would
    be a downside for Spotify. I don’t think that’s the case. So, you know, we still
    have the ability to be on the old terms, and keep going as we’re currently going,”
    Ek said. In other words, nothing is changing for Spotify in the near term as the
    new law goes into effect.

- en: In addition, the CEO suggested some pluses could emerge from the new competitive
    landscape, adding that there are “future upsides” to the new rules that could
    be “quite significant.” The company had hinted before about its plans [in a blog
    post](https://newsroom.spotify.com/2024-01-24/the-dma-means-a-better-spotify-for-artists-creators-and-you/),
    saying that the DMA would allow for things like superfan clubs and alternative
    app stores, and would give creators the ability to download the Spotify for Artists
    app and Spotify for Podcasters app directly from its website. (This was [the first
    time Spotify mentioned superfan clubs](https://www.musicbusinessworldwide.com/did-spotify-just-confirm-that-superfan-clubs-are-coming-to-its-platform/),
    in fact.)

  zh: 此外，CEO暗示新的竞争环境可能带来一些利好，补充道新规则可能带来的“未来增长空间”可能会“相当显著”。公司此前曾在[博客文章中提到](https://newsroom.spotify.com/2024-01-24/the-dma-means-a-better-spotify-for-artists-creators-and-you/)，DMA将允许超级粉丝俱乐部和替代应用商店等功能，并且允许创作者从其网站直接下载Spotify
    for Artists应用和Spotify for Podcasters应用。 （实际上，这是[Spotify首次提到超级粉丝俱乐部](https://www.musicbusinessworldwide.com/did-spotify-just-confirm-that-superfan-clubs-are-coming-to-its-platform/)。）
- en: In addition, the company had earlier said that the loosened rules would mean
    it could communicate to customers in its app about “new products for sale, promotional
    campaigns, superfan clubs, and upcoming events, including when items like audiobooks
    are going on sale,” the blog post read.

  zh: 此外，公司此前曾表示，放宽的规定意味着它可以在应用中向客户传达关于“新产品上市、促销活动、超级粉丝俱乐部以及即将举行的活动，包括像有声读物这样的物品何时开始销售”的信息，博文称。
- en: Ek again confirmed that’s the case, as he told investors that fan clubs were
    among the things Spotify could leverage the new rules to enable, which is something
    it couldn’t have done before because doing so would have made all of Spotify unprofitable.
    In addition to fan clubs, the CEO also suggested that, given proper regulations,
    Spotify could take advantage of its own in-app purchases on things like audiobook
    purchases or top-ups of hours — things that could be “quite meaningful” for Spotify’s
    revenues, given that it currently it has to share a 30% cut of those with Apple.

  zh: Ek再次确认了这一点，他告诉投资者，粉丝俱乐部是Spotify可以利用新规则推动的事情之一，这是以前无法做到的，因为这样做会使Spotify整体无利可图。
    除了粉丝俱乐部外，CEO还建议，根据适当的法规，Spotify可以利用其自身的应用内购买功能，例如购买有声读物或增加小时数 — — 这些对Spotify的收入可能“相当重要”，因为目前它必须与苹果分享这些收入的30%。
- en: Spotify today still struggles to turn a profit, which is why it wants to keep
    as much of the in-app revenues as it can. Last quarter, it turned a rare profit

    restricted in doing on the iOS ecosystem,” he said. “So obviously, my hope is
    still very much that the European Commission will take action and allow this to
    happen,” he said seemingly referring to both the March 7 implementation of the
    law and the possibility that the Commission could force Apple to revise its changes.
    He noted that it would then be “far greater for the ecosystem, both for consumers
    and creators alike.”
