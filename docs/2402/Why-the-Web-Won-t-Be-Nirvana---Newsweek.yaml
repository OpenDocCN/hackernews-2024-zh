- en: After two decades online, I'm perplexed. It's not that I haven't had a gas of
    a good time on the Internet. I've met great people and even caught a hacker or
    two. But today, I'm uneasy about this most trendy and oversold community. Visionaries
    see a future of telecommuting workers, interactive libraries and multimedia classrooms.
    They speak of electronic town meetings and virtual communities. Commerce and business
    will shift from offices and malls to networks and modems. And the freedom of digital
    networks will make government more democratic.

    database will replace your daily newspaper, no CD-ROM can take the place of a
    competent teacher and no computer network will change the way government works.

    anyone to post messages across the nation. Your word gets out, leapfrogging editors
    and publishers. Every voice can be heard cheaply and instantly. The result? Every
    voice is heard. The cacophany more closely resembles citizens band radio, complete
    with handles, harrasment, and anonymous threats. When most everyone shouts, few
    listen. How about electronic publishing? Try reading a book on disc. At best,
    it''s an unpleasant chore: the myopic glow of a clunky computer replaces the friendly
    pages of a book. And you can''t tote that laptop to the beach. Yet Nicholas Negroponte,
    director of the MIT Media Lab, predicts that we''ll soon buy books and newspapers
    straight over the Intenet. Uh, sure.'

    of unedited data, without any pretense of completeness. Lacking editors, reviewers
    or critics, the Internet has become a wasteland of unfiltered data. You don't
    know what to ignore and what's worth reading. Logged onto the World Wide Web,
    I hunt for the date of the Battle of Trafalgar. Hundreds of files show up, and
    it takes 15 minutes to unravel them—one's a biography written by an eighth grader,
    the second is a computer game that doesn't work and the third is an image of a
    London monument. None answers my question, and my search is periodically interrupted
    by messages like, "Too many connections, try again later."

- en: Won't the Internet be useful in governing? Internet addicts clamor for government
    reports. But when Andy Spano ran for county executive in Westchester County, N.Y.,
    he put every press release and position paper onto a bulletin board. In that affluent
    county, with plenty of computer companies, how many voters logged in? Fewer than
    30\. Not a good omen.

    will make schoolwork easy and fun. Students will happily learn from animated characters
    while taught by expertly tailored software.Who needs teachers when you''ve got
    computer-aided education? Bah. These expensive toys are difficult to use in classrooms
    and require extensive teacher training. Sure, kids love videogames—but think of
    your own experience: can you recall even one educational filmstrip of decades
    past? I''ll bet you remember the two or three great teachers who made a difference
    in your life.'

    point and click for great deals. We''ll order airline tickets over the network,
    make restaurant reservations and negotiate sales contracts. Stores will become
    obselete. So how come my local mall does more business in an afternoon than the
    entire Internet handles in a month? Even if there were a trustworthy way to send
    money over the Internet—which there isn''t—the network is missing a most essential
    ingredient of capitalism: salespeople.'

    fawning techno-burble about virtual communities. Computers and networks isolate
    us from one another. A network chat line is a limp substitute for meeting friends
    over coffee. No interactive multimedia display comes close to the excitement of
    a live concert. And who'd prefer cybersex to the real thing? While the Internet
    beckons brightly, seductively flashing an icon of knowledge-as-power, this nonplace
    lures us to surrender our time on earth. A poor substitute it is, this virtual
    reality where frustration is legion and where—in the holy names of Education and
    Progress—important aspects of human interactions are relentlessly devalued.
