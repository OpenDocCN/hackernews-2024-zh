Hello Ruby world! My name is Dusan, and I am a Ruby programmer with more than 15 years of experience. I have worked on various projects, ranging from simple web apps all the way to complex embedded systems, using nothing less than this beautiful and expressive language we all enjoy. I love Ruby so much that I want to share my passion and skills with the rest of the World.

# [](#why-am-i-doing-this)Why am I doing this?

That's why I have created this service, where I offer to work for free on your Ruby project for up to 1.5 hours a month. Yes, you read that right. I will work for free on your Ruby project, no strings attached. Why am I doing this? Because I believe that Ruby is a powerful tool that can help you achieve your goals in record time, and I want to help you make the most of it.

Whether you need help with debugging, testing, refactoring, optimizing, or adding new features to your Ruby project, I can do it for you. I have experience with different frameworks and libraries, including Rails, Sinatra, RSpec, Capybara, and many more. I can work on your Shopify app as well. All in all, I can handle any challenge that comes my way…

# [](#how-does-it-work)How does it work?

All you need to do is sign up for my service and tell me about your project. After that, you can invite [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#75111003350700170c180019105b161a18) as a collaborator on your repository. Once your project is approved(usually within 24 hours) you can start submitting your tasks via email. Other than email you can reach me at any point in time by scheduling a quick Google Meet(only available in paid, M, L, and XL plans).
