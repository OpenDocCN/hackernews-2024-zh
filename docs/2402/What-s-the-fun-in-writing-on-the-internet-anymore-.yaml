    do not require users to even click off the site](https://www.perplexity.ai/search/google-search-results-ET4ll7tdT6axzwgifCC3Gw?s=c).
    In other words, search itself is becoming the delivery of paraphrase and summary.
    Waning are the days of sifting through “search results” to find a specific source.
    Henceforth, digital words are little more than raw data to be crunched, processed,
    and served up by third-party intermediaries.

    to assume these concepts as givens, but they are rapidly sliding into practical
    irrelevance in the age of AI and paywalls. To put any thoughtful labour into crafting
    words online today is to watch them get sucked up, repurposed, and often monetized
    by someone else. It feels a bit like a digital wasteland; overrun with pirates,
    replete with armies of robots regurgitating everything into a gooey cocktail of
    digital sludge.

    eventually grow skeptical about investing their personal creativity in such a
    space, right? Will anyone bother writing on the internet when they know their
    words will be pilfered and junkified? What happens to the craft of *writing itself*
    when our de facto global platform for sharing text no longer reinforces or recognizes
    the role or rights of *authorship*?

    reminds of the world I encountered back in classical studies. There are bits of
    papyrus and parchment are flying around everywhere. Some texts claim attribution,
    some are anonymous, and a lot are pseudonymous—and you can’t tease any of this
    apart with any certainty. There are competing manuscripts, copies of copies, and
    significant “versioning issues” everywhere you look. Ultimately, the credence
    and authority you give to any specific text typically reflects the trust your
    community bestows on it. The only words that survive are the ones that get copied.
    This all sounds strangely familiar, yes?

    out into the world to completely unknown ends. Authorship, accompanied by newfangled
    attributions of moral and legal entitlements, is not yet a refined concept. Once
    you “release” the words, you categorically relinquish control of them. And you
    are fully aware that the more clever and helpful your words are to others, the
    more likely it is that future readers will attribute your words to someone else.

    it is that somebody will poach them. Somebody will probably “paraphrase” your
    work beyond detection. Somebody will “republish” it as their “original.” Somebody
    else will train their large language model on your text and serve it up without
    citations or footnotes. To write on today’s internet and assume universal respect
    for your “moral rights of authorship” is an act of grand delusion.'

    wealth, conviction, and pleasure. But the so-called sanctity of “authorship” is
    only a very recent idea. These “rights” of authorship are only true if they are
    enforced. They are a kind of fiction that only make sense in occasional times,
    places, and cultures. For the next chapter of the human experiment, I wonder if
    “authorship” will again recede into the background, as it often seems to do in
    times of disruptive changes in communication technology.

    even when “authorship” functionally means nothing. And what they write still influences
    their world, with or without the universe dutifully paying homage to their bylines.
    In the long arcs of history, *what* is written typically goes on to mean much
    more than *who* wrote it. The future, like today, is built on ideas, not on the
    people who had them, because people die but ideas never stop evolving.

    to be respected as an author, there’s probably not much fun to be had here at
    all. Don’t write online for fame and glory. Oblivion, obscurity and exploitation
    are all but guaranteed. Write here because *ideas* matter, not authorship. Write
    here because the more robots, pirates, and single-minded trolls swallow up cyberspace,
    the more we need independent writing in order to think new thoughts in the future
    — even if your words are getting dished up and plated by an algorithm.

    them — inform the lexicology and mental corpus of how we think in the future.
    Indeed, the point isn’t “being an author,” but contributing one’s perspective,
    even if one’s personal identity is silenced, erased, and anonymized along the
    way.
