- en: In April 2023, a 54-year-old programmer named Gary Bowser was released from
    prison having served 14 months of a 40-month sentence. Good behaviour reduced
    his time behind bars, but now his options are limited. For a while he was crashing
    on a friend’s couch in Toronto. The weekly physical therapy sessions, which he
    needs to ease chronic pain, were costing hundreds of dollars every week, and he
    didn’t have a job. And soon, he would need to start sending cheques to [Nintendo](https://www.theguardian.com/games/nintendo).
    Bowser owes the makers of Super Mario $14.5m (£11.5m), and he’s probably going
    to spend the rest of his life paying it back.

    His dad was a mechanical engineer, and he learned from him how to wire up model
    trains and mod calculators. As a teenager he already had a computer business:
    his mother died when he was 15, his father had retired and Bowser supported him.'

    experienced worse. It’s better than the time he spent homeless in his early 20s,
    he says. “I have experienced many things over the years, bad situations and good.”
    He carried an optimistic outlook even while imprisoned; at one point he was paid
    to counsel other prisoners on suicide watch. “A lot of other people were going
    crazy, banging their cell doors, screaming, yelling, harming themselves,” he says.
    Bowser was paid a dollar an hour to help them, and his four-hour shifts allowed
