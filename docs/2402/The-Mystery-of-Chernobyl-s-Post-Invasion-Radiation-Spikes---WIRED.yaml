- en: When Russian troops seized control of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant last
    year, following the invasion of Ukraine, President Volodymyr Zelensky called it
    “a declaration of war” against Europe. Others warned that Russia’s reckless seizure
    of the plant could trigger a nuclear disaster to rival Chernobyl’s 1986 radiological
    accident.

- en: Their fears seemed well-founded when, on the night of the invasion, sensors
    began reporting sudden spikes in radiation levels in the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone
    (CEZ)—a 1,000-square-mile forested zone around the plant where radioactive soil
    from the 1986 disaster had settled.

- en: Forty-two sensors recorded spikes that night and the next morning—some at levels
    hundreds of times higher than normal. The State Nuclear Regulatory Inspectorate
    of Ukraine (SNRIU) eased concerns that nuclear material had leaked from the plant,
    however, when it said the spikes were likely due to “resuspension” of radioactive
    soil stirred up by Russian military vehicles—an explanation widely accepted by
    many nuclear experts and the media.

    a paper published in June by the [*Journal of Environmental Radioactivity*](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0265931X23001133?via=ihub),
    they detail why there’s no way soil resuspension could have caused the spikes
    and speculate that interference from an electronic warfare weapon was behind the
    surge instead.

    Ruben Santamarta says he believes something else was the cause—data manipulation,
    possibly through a cyberattack.

- en: Based on patterns he found in the spikes—batches of sensors geographically distant
    from one another recorded spikes at the exact same moment, while sensors closer
    to them recorded no elevation—he thinks a remote hacker or someone with direct
    access to the server processing the data manipulated the numbers.

- en: After an extensive review of the data and other materials, Santamarta says he
    finds it hard to believe the explanation about soil resuspension was ever considered
    plausible. And he is surprised that authorities never bothered to examine the
    data for patterns or, if they did, kept that information from the public. He thinks
    those patterns discount theories about interference from electronic weapons, and
    he plans to [present his findings](https://www.blackhat.com/us-23/briefings/schedule/#seeing-through-the-invisible-radiation-spikes-detected-in-chernobyl-during-the-russian-invasion-show-possible-evidence-of-fabrication-32941)

    OSINT [open source intelligence], hardware and software reverse engineering, and
    data analysis of the radiation levels,” he says “I think it is enough to seriously
    consider the possibility that these radiation spikes were fabricated.”

- en: If Santamarta is right, his finding could have far-reaching implications for
    radiation-monitoring systems around the world, says a former nuclear safety official
    who asked to remain anonymous in order to speak freely about the matter. If the
    data was manipulated, it could undermine trust in radiation-monitoring systems
    or change how data from them gets reported publicly. Data from radiation monitors
    is often [distributed publicly in near real time](https://www.epa.gov/radnet/near-real-time-and-laboratory-data-state)
    so that governments and nuclear experts can actively monitor conditions in populated
    cities and around nuclear facilities. But this creates a risk that hackers or
    others could alter data to trigger public alarm before proper verification can
    occur.

- en: Russian troops entered the CEZ early on the morning of February 24 last year
    because it’s the shortest and most direct route from Russia-friendly Belarus to
    Kyiv, Ukraine’s capital 80 miles south of the plant. But some feared Russia’s
    interest in Chernobyl was more than strategic. They worried the military could
    cause a disaster using radioactive waste at the plant or drum up false claims
    that Ukraine was building a dirty bomb there.

- en: After a day-long battle with Ukrainian troops and three hours of negotiations
    to establish parameters for Russia’s occupation of the plant, Russia took control
    of Chernobyl’s facilities. At 8:40 pm local time, 10 minutes after the SNRIU indicated
    that Russia had formally taken control of the plant, seven monitoring stations
    in the CEZ suddenly began reporting elevated radiation levels. The readings ranged
    from two to five times the normal radiation rate each sensor had historically
    detected, but one station showed a level eight times higher than normal.
