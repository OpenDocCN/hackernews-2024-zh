    cuticular hydrocarbon extracts were evaporated to a volume of approximately 100 μL

    mass selective detector (MS) by Agilent Technologies (Waldbronn, Germany). The
    GC was equipped with a DB-5 capillary column (0.25 mm ID × 30 m; film thickness
    0.25 μm, J & W Scientific, Folsom, Ca, USA). Helium was used as a carrier gas
    with a constant flow of 1 mL/min. A temperature program from 60 °C to 300 °C with
    5 °C/min and finally 10 min at 300 °C was employed. Mass spectra were recorded
    in the EI mode with an ionization voltage of 70 eV and a source temperature of
    230 °C. The software ChemStation v. F.01.03.2357 (Agilent Technologies, Waldbronn,
    Germany) for windows was used for data acquisition. Identification of the components
    was accomplished by comparison of library data (NIST 17) with mass spectral data

    from the gland’s atrium (it is a very sticky substance that adheres to the cuticle),
    we decided to remove the atrium of the gland together with the secretory cells
    entirely, using a microscalpel and microscissors. To avoid using a solvent we
    used a Thermodesorber unit coupled to a GC-MS (TD-GC-MS). For this we transported
    frozen ants to the University of Würzburg and did the extractions directly in
    the laboratory next to the TD-GC-MS. One metapleural gland from each of six worker
    was pooled per sample. As a control we further collected pieces of cuticle of
    similar size from the side of the thorax to identify any potential contaminations
    which might have occurred during dissections. In total 3 samples (of 6 individuals

    were performed with the ZEISS Xradia 510 Versa 3D X-ray microscope at the Okinawa
    Institute of Science and Technology Graduate University, Japan. We scanned the
    thorax (mesosoma) and whole body to visualize both the structure of the gland,
    and its location in the whole ant. The scan parameters for the thorax scan were:
    Voxel size, 4.404 μm; Exposure time, 6 s; Voltage, 40 kV; Power, 3 W; Source distance,
    23.147 mm; Objective, 4x; Projections, 1601\. For the full body scan, we used:
    Voxel size, 12.5 μm; Exposure time, 1 s; Voltage, 40 kV; Power, 3 W; Source distance,
    25.03 mm; Objective, 0.4x; Projections, 1601\. The 3D reconstruction was performed
    using the ZEISS Scout-and-Scan Control System Reconstructor software (ZEISS Microscopy,
    Jena, Germany). The MG structures were manually segmented using Amira (version
    2019.2; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Berlin, Germany) and visualized using VGStudio3.4
    (Volume Graphics GmbH, Heidelberg, Germany). The gland atrium was rendered using
    isosurface and a clipping plane was created to visualize the cross-section. All
    other materials were visualized using Phong volume rendering.'

    To select the appropriate statistical tests, we tested for deviations from the
    normal distribution with the Shapiro–Wilks test (*P* > 0.05). A Bartlett test
    was used to verify homoscedasticity (*P* > 0.05). All our models included colony
    as a random factor and an overall likelihood ratio test against an intercept only
    model. In case of multiple testing, a Holm-Bonferroni correction was performed
    with the adjusted P-values given throughout the text. To test for significant
    differences in the survival curves, we conducted mixed effect cox proportional
    hazards regression models (Supplementary Fig. [2](/articles/s41467-023-43885-w#MOESM1))
    using the R package survminer (v0.4.9) followed by post-hoc analyses using least
    square means with the R package lsmeans (v.2.30; Supplementary Tables [3](/articles/s41467-023-43885-w#MOESM1), 4
    and [6](/articles/s41467-023-43885-w#MOESM1)). The survival curves were illustrated
    using Kaplan-Meier cumulative survival curves (Figs. [1](/articles/s41467-023-43885-w#Fig1)c,
    [2](/articles/s41467-023-43885-w#Fig2)a, and [4](/articles/s41467-023-43885-w#Fig4),
    and Supplementary Figs. [3](/articles/s41467-023-43885-w#MOESM1) and [5](/articles/s41467-023-43885-w#MOESM1)).
    For the bacterial load (ΔCq) within the thorax content between treated and untreated
    infected individuals (Figs. [1](/articles/s41467-023-43885-w#Fig1)a and [2b](/articles/s41467-023-43885-w#Fig2))
    we conducted linear mixed effect models with a least square means (lsmeans) post-hoc
    analysis. For the bacterial growth inhibition (Fig. [3d](/articles/s41467-023-43885-w#Fig3))
    we conducted a Mann–Whitney *U* test. Differences in the CHC-profile composition
    were calculated using a permutational multivariate analysis of variance (ADONIS)
    on a Bray-Curtis dissimilarity matrix using the package vegan (v.2.5–7; Supplementary
    Table [7](/articles/s41467-023-43885-w#MOESM1)). For the different durations of
    MG care between sterile and infected individuals (Supplementary Fig. [4](/articles/s41467-023-43885-w#MOESM1)),
    we conducted a linear mixed effect model with individual as random factor followed
    by a Satterthwaite’s t-test. For differences between chemical compound groups
    of the CHC profiles (Supplementary Fig. [6](/articles/s41467-023-43885-w#MOESM1)),
    we conducted an analysis of variance (AOV) followed by a Tukey Honest Significant
    differences test (Supplementary Table [9](/articles/s41467-023-43885-w#MOESM1)).
    For behavioral differences in wound care between sterile and infected individuals
    (Fig. [3b, c](/articles/s41467-023-43885-w#Fig3)), we modeled wound care as a
    binary event using binomial generalized additive models with posthoc contrasts
    to identify intervals of time during which the probability of receiving wound
    care differed between sterile and infected individuals. See Supplementary Information
    for a reproducible modeling workflow.'

    to include scientists based in the country where the study was carried out. We
    recognize that more could have been done to engage local scientists with our research
    as our project developed, and to embed our research within the national context
    and research priorities. Whenever possible, our research was discussed with local
    stakeholders to seek feedback on the questions to be tackled and the approach
    to be considered. Whenever relevant, literature published by scientists from the
    region was also cited; efforts were made to consider relevant work published in
    the local language.
