    seamless patterns, gradients, textures, shapes and blobs. Use the generated vector
    patterns directly on the web or in your favorite design app.

- en: ‚ú® SVG stands for [**Scalable Vector Graphics**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG)
    and using SVGs on the web offers many benefits. For example, SVGs can be scaled
    to any size without ever losing visual quality, they can be edited later-on by
    tweaking the underlining markup and they can often be more lightweight than images
    that have been saved to a raster format like PNG or JPEG.

- en: üñºÔ∏è If you want to use the SVGs as background patterns, you can use the [base64
    encoder](/eeencode/) so that you can add the background images inline in your
    CSS.

    picking great colors for your designs. For example, try out the [color picker](/cccolor/)
    or the [color palette generator](/pppalette/).
