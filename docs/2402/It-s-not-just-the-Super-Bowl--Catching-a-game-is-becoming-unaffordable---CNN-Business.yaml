    and much of it has been by design. Teams create a limited supply of seats, and
    increased competition for those seats among people with disposable income is driving
    up prices fiercely. Dynamic pricing for tickets on [ticket-resale platforms](https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/08/tech/senators-unveil-live-ticketing-reform-bill-aimed-at-bots-and-resellers/index.html)

    platforms. Ticketmaster and StubHub use sophisticated dynamic pricing algorithms
    that change minute-by-minute based on demand. Teams such as the New York Yankees
    have taken a stake in ticket resale platforms. These clubs see an opportunity
    to make more money by taking a cut of the secondary ticket sale between buyers

    to sell empty seats for rock-bottom prices. They worry that selling the cheap
    seats as the teams get more desperate for fans in the stadium would push people
    in the future to wait for lower prices before buying their tickets. So seats sometimes
    sit empty or are covered over.
