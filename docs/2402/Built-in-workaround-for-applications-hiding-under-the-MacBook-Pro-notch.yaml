- en: A frustrating aspect of the new MacBook Pro models is the notch. The notch itself
    isn't the problem; rather, it's that Apple hasn't automatically adjusted the menu
    bar icons so they don't hide behind the notch when many apps are running.

- en: You can adjust the values from `0` to `6` to accommodate even more icons. Personally,
    I found `6` to be a good fit. This will allow you to add more items to your menu
    bar before they will be hidden under the notch. I estimate that with the value
    of `6` I can fit 21 apps to the menu bar with my 14‚Äù MBP. If your apps will again
    be hidden under the notch you can just lower this value.
