- en: Hello Ruby world! My name is Dusan, and I am a Ruby programmer with more than
    15 years of experience. I have worked on various projects, ranging from simple
    web apps all the way to complex embedded systems, using nothing less than this
    beautiful and expressive language we all enjoy. I love Ruby so much that I want
    to share my passion and skills with the rest of the World.
