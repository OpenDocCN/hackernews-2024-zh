- en: Small Modular Reactor (SMR) construction shifts into high gear, as UK company
    Sheffield Forgemasters welds a full-size nuclear reactor vessel in under 24 hours
    instead of the usual 12 months. The rollout of this game-changing tech could be
    massive.

- en: Modular reactors have the potential to revolutionize the nuclear power industry
    by turning nuclear generating plants from major civil engineering projects to
    factory-produced commodities. Instead of being essentially one-offs, modular reactors
    have a standardized design, can be mass produced, installed in any number required
    to serve local needs, and don't require the incredibly expensive buildings conventional
    reactors depend upon.

- en: The problem is that there are bottlenecks in how to build reactors of any size.
    One is welding the vessels used to contain the reactor core, isolating it from
    the outer environment. Using conventional techniques, this can take over a year,
    but Sheffield Forgemasters have reduced this to under a day using what is called
    Local Electron-Beam Welding (LEBW) to complete four thick, nuclear-grade welds.

- en: LEBW is a revolutionary method to weld two pieces of metal together using a
    high-energy density fusion process centered on a high-powered electron gun operating
    in a local vacuum. This melts and fuses components to one another and allows for
    an efficiency of 95%, deep penetration, and a high depth-to-width ratio.

    meters (10 ft) in diameter with 200-mm (8-in) thick walls with what is claimed
    to be zero defects and at lower costs. In addition, the welding machine can handle
    innovative sloping-in and sloping-out techniques to start and finish the weld.

- en: This demonstration, a world first, is a significant milestone for the British
    nuclear sector, which has been moribund for decades with advances only in reactors
    for nuclear submarines, a couple of showcase power plants, and nuclear fuel processing.
    Now, the UK government is looking toward a nuclear renaissance, with new plants
    planned – including 15 modular reactors to be constructed by [Rolls-Royce](https://newatlas.com/energy/rolls-royce-plans-mini-nuclear-reactors-in-britain/).

- en: '"The implication of this technology within the nuclear industry is monumental,
    potentially taking high-cost welding processes out of the equation," said Michael
    Blackmore, Senior Development Engineer and Project lead. "Not only does this reduce
    the need for weld-inspections, because the weld-join replicates the parent material,
    but it could also dramatically speed up the roll-out of SMR reactors across the
    UK and beyond, that’s how disruptive the LEBW breakthrough is."'
