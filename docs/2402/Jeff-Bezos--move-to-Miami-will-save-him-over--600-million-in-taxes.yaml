    that he was leaving Seattle after nearly 30 years to move to Miami. He said the
    move was to be closer to his parents and his rocket launches at Blue Origin. The
    timing also suggested another reason: taxes.'

- en: In 2022 Washington state imposed a new, 7% capital gains tax on sales of stocks
    or bonds of more than $250,000\. Washington state doesn't have a personal income
    tax, so the new levy marked the first time Bezos would face state taxes on his
    stock sales.

    shares almost every year for more than two decades to fund his philanthropy, his
    space company Blue Origin, and more recently his $500 million mega yacht and a
    growing collection of mansions purchased with his fiancé Lauren Sanchez.

    Amazon stock in 2022 or 2023, gifting only $200 million of shares at the end of
    last year.

- en: After his move to Miami, Bezos made up for lost time. Last week, a filing with
    the SEC revealed that Bezos launched a pre-scheduled stock-selling plan to unload
    50 million shares before Jan. 31, 2025\. At today's price, that would total more
    than $8.7 billion.

- en: Florida has no state income tax or a tax on capital gains. So on the $2 billion
    sale last week, he saved $140 million that he would have paid to Washington state.
    On the entire sale of 50 million shares over the next year, he will save at least
    $610 million. And that's assuming Amazon shares remain flat. If they continue
    to rise, the value of his shares — and his tax savings — will be even higher.

- en: For his new digs, Bezos purchased two mansions in Indian Creek for $147 million
    and is reportedly looking at three other properties on the island, which also
    counts Tom Brady and Carl Icahn as residents. Miami brokers say Bezos is likely
    to tear down the homes and build a new one, with the total costs of the new estate
    likely topping $200 million.
