- en: Well, I hate to tell you, Broadcom — but from what I’m hearing, your customers
    and partners disagree. VMware’s rivals, including [Nutanix](https://www.nutanix.com/).
    [Scale Computing](https://www.scalecomputing.com/), and [Virtuozzo](https://www.virtuozzo.com/),
    are loving it, though. Bigger companies, such as Microsoft with Hyper-V/Azure
    Stack and Red Hat with OpenShift Virtualization, also have reason to put VMware
    customers at the top of their marketing list.

- en: Besides the VMware licensing change, which is always worrisome, VMware customers
    are also worried sick about the new line’s pricing. Even before Broadcom bought
    the company, VMware was expensive. They’re afraid, with reason, that they’ll pay
    even more.

- en: 'VMware’s once-flourishing partners are also concerned. Most companies don’t
    work with VMware directly. They worked with partners, instead. First, [Broadcom
    dumped all its resellers and service partners](https://www.crn.com/news/virtualization/broadcom-hands-vmware-partners-termination-notice).
    Then, it opened the door for its top former partners to come back in. Did they?
    Well, [VMware also took its top 2,000 customers](https://www.crn.com/news/virtualization/2024/broadcom-takes-top-vmware-accounts-direct-effective-immediately)
    [direct](https://www.crn.com/news/virtualization/2024/broadcom-takes-top-vmware-accounts-direct-effective-immediately), 
    which doesn’t leave much room for VMware’s former partners. The VMware partner
    slogan, “VMware Partners: An Ecosystem of Trust,” sure sounds hollow.'
