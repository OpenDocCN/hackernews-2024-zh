    severe memory loss — occurring at epidemic levels today — was extremely rare 2,000
    to 2,500 years ago, in the time of Aristotle, Galen and Pliny the Elder.

    bolsters the idea that Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias are diseases
    of modern environments and lifestyles, with sedentary behavior and exposure to
    air pollution largely to blame.

    that would be like mild cognitive impairment,” said first author [Caleb Finch](https://gero.usc.edu/faculty/finch/),
    a University Professor at the USC Leonard Davis School of Gerontology. “When we
    got to the Romans, and we uncovered at least four statements that suggest rare
    cases of advanced dementia — we can’t tell if it’s Alzheimer’s. So, there was
    a progression going from the ancient Greeks to the Romans.”

    recognize as mild cognitive impairment, or MCI, but nothing approaching a major
    loss of memory, speech and reasoning as caused by Alzheimer’s and other types
    of dementia.

    Los Angeles, pored over a major body of ancient medical writing by Hippocrates
    and his followers. The text catalogs ailments of the elderly such as deafness,
    dizziness and digestive disorders — but makes no mention of memory loss.

    at the age of 80, some elderly begin to have difficulty learning new things. Pliny
    the Elder notes that the senator and famous orator Valerius Messalla Corvinus
    forgot his own name. Cicero prudently observed that “elderly silliness … is characteristic
    of irresponsible old men, but not of all old men.”

    up cases of cognitive decline. In addition, Roman aristocrats used lead cooking
    vessels, lead water pipes and even added lead acetate into their wine to sweeten
    it — unwittingly poisoning themselves with the powerful neurotoxin.'

    but little progress was made in dealing with the problem until well into the 20th century.
    Some scholars blame lead poisoning for the fall of the Roman Empire.)

    In the absence of demographic data for ancient Greece and Rome, Finch turned to
    a surprising model for ancient aging: today’s [Tsimane Amerindians](https://today.usc.edu/tsimane-moseten-brain-aging/),
    an Indigenous people of the Bolivian Amazon.'

    that is very physically active, and they have extremely low rates of dementia.
    An international team of cognitive researchers led by Margaret Gatz, a professor
    of psychology, gerontology and preventive medicine at the USC Leonard Davis School,
    found among older Tsimane people, [only about 1% suffer from dementia](https://today.usc.edu/some-of-the-worlds-lowest-dementia-rates-are-found-in-amazonian-indigenous-groups/).
    In contrast, 11% of people aged 65 and older living in the United States have
    dementia, according to the [Alzheimer’s Association](https://act.alz.org/site/SPageServer/).

    is the best-documented large population of older people that have minimal dementia,
    all of which indicates that the environment is a huge determinant on dementia
    risk. They give us a template for asking these questions.”
