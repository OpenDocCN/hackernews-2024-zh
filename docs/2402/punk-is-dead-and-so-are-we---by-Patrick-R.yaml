    through-the-rabbit-hole version of Francis Fukuyama’s “End of History” spiel,
    issued two decades later, examining “the widespread sense that not only is capitalism
    the only viable political and economic system, but also that it is now *impossible*
    even to imagine a coherent alternative to it.” Western capitalism prevailed over
    Soviet communism, neoliberalism put its shoulder to the wheel, and now there’s
    no way off the ride and no exit ramps to anything else. The social environment
    set up by private firms and their enablers (as opposed to public institutions,
    religious organizations, or any other languishing political/cultural organs) determines
    our aspirations and our means, ingrains our values, delineates our conceptual

    and absorb energies from outside. It now, in fact, has the opposite problem; having
    all-too successfully incorporated externality, how can it function without an
    outside it can colonize and appropriate? For most people under twenty in Europe
    and North America, the lack of alternatives to capitalism is no longer even an
    issue. Capitalism seamlessly occupies the horizons of the thinkable…It would be
    dangerous and misleading to imagine that the near past was some prelapsarian state
    rife with political potentials, so it''s as well to remember the role that commodification
    played in the production of culture throughout the twentieth century. Yet the
    old struggle between detournement and recuperation, between subversion and incorporation,
    seems to have been played out. What we are dealing with now is not the incorporation
    of materials that previously seemed to possess subversive potentials, but instead,
    their precorporation: the pre-emptive formatting and shaping of desires, aspirations
    and hopes by capitalist culture. Witness, for instance, the establishment of settled
    “alternative” or “independent” cultural zones, which endlessly repeat older gestures
    of rebellion and contestation as if for the first time. “Alternative” and “independent”

    whose every move was anticipated, tracked, bought and sold before it had even
    happened. Cobain knew that he was just another piece of spectacle, that nothing
    runs better on MTV than a protest against MTV; knew that his every move was a
    cliche scripted in advance, knew that even realizing it is a cliche…Here, even
    success meant failure, since to succeed would only mean that you were the new
    meat on which the system could feed. But the high existential angst of Nirvana
    and Cobain belongs to an older moment; what succeeded them was a pastiche-rock
    which reproduced the forms of the past without anxiety. Cobain's death confirmed
    the defeat and incorporation of rock's Utopian and promethean ambitions. When
    he died, rock was already being eclipsed by hip hop, whose global success has
    presupposed just the kind of precorporation by capital which I alluded to above.

    知道他只是另一个景观的一部分，知道在 MTV 上没有比反对 MTV 更流行的事情；知道他的每一个举动都是提前写好的陈词滥调，知道即使意识到这也是一个陈词滥调……在这里，即使成功也意味着失败，因为成功只会意味着你是系统可以利用的新鲜肉。但
    Nirvana 和 Cobain 的高度存在主义焦虑属于一个更古老的时刻；接替他们的是一种复制过去形式而没有焦虑的拼贴摇滚。Cobain 的死证实了摇滚乌托邦和普罗米修斯野心的失败和并入。当他去世时，摇滚已经被嘻哈音乐所超越，后者的全球成功已经预设了资本的前置腐蚀，我前面提到的那种。

    sentimental illusions and seen it for ‘what it really is’: a Hobbesian war of
    all against all, a system of perpetual exploitation and generalized criminality.

- en: The best year to be a hippie was 1965, but then there was not much to write
    about, because not much was happening in public and most of what was happening
    in private was illegal. The real year of the hippie was 1966, despite the lack
    of publicity, which in 1967 gave way to a nationwide avalanche in *Look*, *Life*,
    *Time*, *Newsweek*, the *Atlantic*, the *New York Times*, the *Saturday Evening
    Post*, and even the *Aspen Illustrated News*, which did a special issue on hippies
    in August of 1967 and made a record sale of all but 6 copies of a 3,500-copy press
    run. But 1967 was not really a good year to be a hippie. It was a good year for
    salesmen and exhibitionists who called themselves hippies and gave colorful interviews
    for the benefit of the mass media, but serious hippies, with nothing to sell,
    found that they had little to gain and a lot to lose by becoming public figures.
    Many were harassed and arrested for no other reason than their sudden identification
    with a so-called cult of sex and drugs. The publicity rumble, which seemed like
    a joke at first, turned into a menacing landslide. So quite a few people who might
    have been called the original hippies in 1965 had dropped out of sight by the
    time hippies became a national fad in 1967.

    1967 年却在《Look》、《Life》、《Time》、《Newsweek》、《大西洋月刊》、《纽约时报》、《周六晚邮报》甚至《阿斯彭插图新闻》等全国性媒体上掀起了一场热潮，1967
    年 8 月，《Aspen Illustrated News》还专门刊登了一期关于嬉皮士的特别报道，并在 3,500 份发行量中售出了除了 6 份之外的全部。但是
    1967 年并不是成为嬉皮士的好年头。对于那些没有东西出售的认真的嬉皮士来说，成为公众人物意味着鲜有收获却可能失去很多。许多人因突然被贴上所谓性和毒品崇拜者的标签而遭到骚扰和逮捕，而这只是因为媒体对他们的广泛报道。最初看似玩笑的公众关注转变成了令人不安的声势浩大。因此，许多人在
    1965 年可能被称为最早的嬉皮士的时候，已经在嬉皮士成为 1967 年全国性热潮之前消失了。
- en: Ten years earlier the Beat Generation went the same confusing route. From 1955
    to about 1959 there were thousands of young people involved in a thriving bohemian
    subculture that was only an echo by the time the mass media picked it up in 1960\.
    Jack Kerouac was the novelist of the Beat Generation in the same way that Ernest
    Hemingway was the novelist of the Lost Generation, and Kerouac’s classic “beat”
    novel, *On the Road*, was published in 1957\. Yet by the time Kerouac began appearing
    on television shows to explain the “thrust” of his book, the characters it was
    based on had already drifted off into limbo, to await their reincarnation as hippies
    some five years later. (The purest example of this was Neal Cassidy, who served
    as a model for Dean Moriarty in *On the Road* and also for McMurphy in Ken Kesey’s
    *One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest*.) **Publicity follows reality, but only up to
    the point where a new kind of reality, created by publicity, begins to emerge.**
    So the hippie in 1967 was put in the strange position of being an anti-culture
    hero at the same time as he was also becoming a hot commercial property. His banner
    of alienation appeared to be planted in quicksand. The very society he was trying
    to drop out of began idealizing him. He was famous in a hazy kind of way that
    was not quite infamy but still colorfully ambivalent and vaguely disturbing.

    年报道时，这种文化已经只剩余音。杰克·凯鲁亚克是垮掉的一代的小说家，就像欧内斯特·海明威是失落的一代的小说家一样，凯鲁亚克的经典小说《在路上》于 1957
    年出版。然而，当凯鲁亚克开始在电视节目中解释他书中的"动力"时，他的原型已经在五年后消失得无影无踪，等待作为嬉皮士的再生。 （这种情况的最纯粹的例子是尼尔·卡西迪，他是《在路上》中迪安·莫里亚蒂的原型，也是肯·凯西的《飞越杜鹃窝》中麦克墨菲的原型。）
    **公众追随现实，但只到一个新的现实，由宣传所创造，开始出现为止。** 因此，1967 年的嬉皮士处于一个奇怪的位置，既是反文化英雄，同时也正在变成炙手可热的商业财产。他的异化旗帜似乎树立在流沙中。他试图脱离的社会正开始理想化他。他以一种朦胧但并非声名狼藉而又色彩斑斓的方式成为了名人。

    clothes in department stores. Cast its stereotyped characters in movies. Dispatch
    the magazines to find ambitious and charismatic figures to become the scene’s
    public faces and clarify its definition as a brand. Subject the oldheads and their
    hangouts to a deluge of adventurous college students and then teeny-boppers. By
