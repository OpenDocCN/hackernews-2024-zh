- en: Today marks a significant moment in our journey, and I am thrilled to share
    some important news with you. After much thoughtful consideration, I have decided
    to transition from the role of CEO of Mozilla Corporation back to the position
    of Mozilla Corporation Executive Chairwoman, a role I held with great passion
    for many years.

- en: During my 25 years at Mozilla, I’ve worn many hats, and this move is driven
    by a desire to streamline our focus and leadership for the challenges ahead. I’ve
    been leading the Mozilla business through a transformative period, while also
    overseeing Mozilla’s broader mission. It’s become evident that both endeavors
    need dedicated full-time leadership.

    and the fabric of the internet has reached unprecedented lows. There’s a tectonic
    shift underway as everyone battles to own the future of AI. It is Mozilla’s opportunity
    and imperative to forge a better future. I’m excited about Laura’s day-to-day
    involvement and the chance for Mozilla to achieve more. Our power lies in the
    collective effort of people contributing to something better and I’m eager for
    Mozilla to meet the needs of this era more fully.
