    highs](https://www.colliers.com/en/research/new-york/nyc-q4-2023-manhattan-office-report),
    commercial property owners are desperately trying to avoid default by upgrading
    their spaces to attract new tenants, converting their space into apartments, or
    simply offloading their assets. One longtime industry professional doesn’t think
    that will be enough.

    environment will recover. And then you’ve got another group that will somehow
    hang in there and get reset in pricing,” said Cordova, who is CEO of the real
    estate consultancy. “And then you have the others that are basically worth nothing—the
    D class. Those just have to be torn down. That’s probably at least 30% of all
    offices in the country.”

    that federal subsidies to assist with converting offices to apartments could offer
    some aid to developers suffering from the precipitous drop in demand for office
    space. But it likely won’t be enough to stop a significant chunk of the commercial
    market from collapsing, both figuratively and literally.

    “urban doom loop,” where falling property values shrink a city’s tax base, cutting
    off funding for essential public services that only drag property values down
    further. Columbia Business School professor Stijn Van Nieuwerburgh, who’s been
    dubbed the “[prophet of urban doom](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/08/nyregion/doom-loop-remote-work-pandemic-nyc.html)”
    for his research on the topic, told *Fortune* that we’re close to the “event horizon”
    of that vicious public-finance circle.

    In New York City and elsewhere, residents are facing a [surplus of office space
    alongside a severe shortage of housing](https://fortune.com/2024/01/04/commercial-real-estate-office-buildings-muted-outlook-2024-moodys-analytics/).
    Simply converting square footage from commercial to residential sounds like a
    simple fix, but the government would need to play a part for it to take off.

    relative to our future needs, and a lot of places have too little housing. So
    I think one way or another, we’re going to have to turn some of that office space
    into apartments,” said Van Nieuwerburgh. “That might have to partially happen
    through demolition. But it would be nice if we could have at least some of it
    through conversion. It’s sort of the environmentally friendly way to go.”

    Zoning codes mandating natural light and fresh air make it tricky to adapt large,
    open-concept office floor plans into apartments that are up to code. [Many buildings
    put up during the construction boom of the 1950s and 60s simply aren’t capable
    of being converted into housing](https://fortune.com/2023/08/01/office-to-residential-conversions-could-ease-housing-market-shortage/).
    And skyrocketing construction costs are squeezing margins for would-be developers,
    meaning that simply tearing an office building down and replacing it with brand-new
    apartments is actually often the cheaper option, said Cordova.

    the market rate is $350\. For high-end luxury, it’s $450\. The economic model
    is very challenging for conversion,” said Cordova. “The way to do it is for governments
    to provide subsidies for conversion…the government needs to provide about a 20%
    cost subsidy.”

    If states and municipalities start pushing their own programs, it could make the
    bottom line worth it for developers. But even with juicy incentives, Cordova predicts
    that almost one-third of all commercial buildings simply won’t make it through
    a downturn in office demand, a trend he calls “the great reset.”'
