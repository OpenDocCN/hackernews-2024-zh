- en: Around last year this blog, a simple static site, was running on GitHub pages,
    together with Cloudflare in front of it due to (perceived) unreliability with
    GitHub’s SSL provisioning for custom domains. In order to simplify my stack, I
    tried running it on [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/).

- en: The setup process was extremely smooth. Connecting to the GitHub repository
    where my blog lives worked just as expected, setting up their CI was painless,
    and since Cloudflare was already managing my domain’s DNS, switching over DNS
    records to point to the new static site was literally just a button click.

    in Cloudflare’s static site hosting that made me stop using their services immediately.

    and have since then put a lot of care into ensuring this format never changes
    as I moved away from it, even though the format could perhaps be a little bit
    cleaner.

- en: In fact, all URLs with `.html` now redirect with `301 Permanent Redirect` to
    the “cleaned up” version! That’s why navigating my blog was still working fine,
    as literally every click on the page was being redirected to the “cleaned up”
    URL.

- en: Now this is probably closer to the URL format I would start out with today if
    I had to start a new blog. But Cloudflare’s redirect is permanent and has been
    public for a few weeks, therefore all Google search results were pointing to the
    cleaned up URLs. If I wanted to move to a different static site host, I would
    have to install additional redirects so that none of those links break, just to
    clean up a mess I didn’t cause.

    slightly more conservative way: If you request `/<year>/<slug>`, it will serve
    up `/<year>/<slug>.html` just as if you requested it directly. However, GitHub
    does not issue any permanent redirects, so it does not lock me into anything at
    all.'

- en: This made it a rather easy decision for me to switch back to GitHub pages. Together
    with adding `<link rel="canonical" ...>` to all my subpages, no links are broken
    and the Google search results should eventually self-correct.

- en: I can only assume that the way that Cloudflare justifies this sort of URL rewriting
    is through arguments similar to the ones found in [Cool URIs don’t change](https://www.w3.org/Provider/Style/URI).

- en: However I think it would be a gross misinterpretation of that article if your
    takeaway is to plainly remove `.html` from all URLs and issue permanent redirects.
    If your URL prettification happens in a way that can easily break when moving
    between static site hosts, you have not made URLs more stable, you just made them
    prettier. In fact, Cloudflare Pages now made my URLs more brittle and less cool,
    because they now not only depend on the choices made by my static site generator,
    but also on my choice of static site host.

- en: This blog will continue to serve cool-but-ugly URLs. If I ever attempt to make
    them prettier, I will do so with intent, and not by accident. And probably as
    part of static site generation, not in the routing layer of a random cloud service.
