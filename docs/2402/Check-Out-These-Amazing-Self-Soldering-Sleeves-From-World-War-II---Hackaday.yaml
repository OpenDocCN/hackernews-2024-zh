    the midst of World War II. You need to hook up some wires to your explosive charges,
    and time is of the essence. Do you bust out the trusty Weller and see if those
    petulant Axis chaps will let you plug it in somewhere? No! You use a pyrotechnic
    self-soldering sleeve, [as [Our Own Devices] explains.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05wL-zf1wbo)

    They were developed by the Special Operation Executive, an organization charged
    with sabotage and subversion operations in then-occupied Europe.

- en: The soldering sleeves were designed to make electrical connections between detonators
    and firing wires for explosives.  The sleeves consist of a copper tube through
    which wires to be joined are fed, with a lump of solder in the middle. The assembly
    is covered in pyrotechnic material with a safety match-style starter chemical
    dosed on top. Using the sleeves is simple. First, two stripped wires are fed into
    either end of the copper tube. The starter the sleeve is then ignited using the
    box, just like striking a match. The pyrotechnic material then gets red hot, melting
    the solder and making the connection.

    actually work. We’ve explored the use of [more-typical solder sleeves before,
    too](https://hackaday.com/2023/12/18/ask-hackaday-what-do-you-do-when-you-cant-solder/).
