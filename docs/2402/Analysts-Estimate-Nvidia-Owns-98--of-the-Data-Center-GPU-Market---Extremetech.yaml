- en: Nvidia has gotten a lot of press over the past year, thanks to the surging interest
    in AI. Its revenues have skyrocketed thanks to this new trend in computing, as
    its data center GPUs are considered the gold standard in the industry. This has
    led to a global shortage of Nvidia GPUs for AI, with companies scrambling to get
    as many GPUs as possible. This has reportedly led Nvidia to capture 98% of the
    current data center GPU market, according to analysts from Wells Fargo.

- en: A summary of the report from Wells Fargo Equity Research was [posted on X](https://twitter.com/EricFlaningam/status/1752053817691034072)
    by a Microsoft employee, and it contains some interesting insights into the data
    center GPU market. Chief among those is that Nvidia is projected to earn between
    $37 billion and $45.7 billion from data center GPUs for 2023 and 2024\. For context,
    in its 2023 annual report, Nvidia reported [$15 billion](https://s201.q4cdn.com/141608511/files/doc_financials/2023/ar/2023-Annual-Report-1.pdf)
    in data center revenue for fiscal 2023, which ended in September. That said, Nvidia's
    data center revenue is accelerating rapidly, as its revenues [increased 279% year-over-year](https://www.extremetech.com/computing/nvidias-third-quarter-earnings-show-over-200-gains-year-over-year)
    at the end of 2023\. That pace will likely continue for the foreseeable future.

    AMD is projected to make some inroads. The company may whittle Nvidia's market
    share down to a lowly 94-96 percent this year as its Instinct products proliferate
    through the industry. [According](https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/cpus/amds-announces-it-has-orders-for-dollar35-billion-of-its-ai-gpus-but-the-stock-tumbled-in-after-hours-trading)
    to Tom's Hardware, AMD's CEO noted in this week's earnings call that it's already
    received $3.5 billion in orders for its newest MI300 AI accelerator. Despite that
    situation, Wells Fargo estimates AMD's data center GPU revenue over the coming
    year will range from $461 million to $2.1 billion, so it'll be only a fraction
    of Nvidia's earnings.

    dent. In December, Intel's CEO stated that [its upcoming Gaudi 3 accelerators](https://www.extremetech.com/computing/intel-upcoming-gaudi3-ai-accelerator-will-compete-with-nvidia-h100-amd)
    will be competitive with Nvidia's H100 and AMD's MI300 accelerators. Still, the
    company clearly has a long road ahead of it when competing in this space, especially
    given the software ecosystems involved.

    Nvidia finds itself in a very strong position, which is putting it lightly. The
    company is expected to extend its dominance as it launches Blackwell later this
    year, but as the Wells Fargo analysts note, it's being held back by packaging.
    TSMC doesn't have enough CoWoS (chip on wafer on substrate) production to satisfy
    demand for Nvidia's (and AMD's) data center GPUs. TSMC [has already announced](https://www.extremetech.com/computing/tsmc-to-boost-chip-packaging-capacity-with-29-billion-investment)
    a $2.9 billion investment in more CoWoS packaging, but it won't bear fruit until
    later this year.
