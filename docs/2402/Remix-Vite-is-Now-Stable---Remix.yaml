    is now stable in Remix v2.7.0! After the [initial unstable release of Remix Vite](./remix-heart-vite),
    we’ve been hard at work refining and extending it over the past few months with
    help from all of our early adopters and community contributors.

    a server to their Remix app in the future, the migration path is now much more
    straightforward.

    allowing you to nest your entire application within a subpath — but this feature
    was [notably absent in Remix](https://github.com/remix-run/remix/discussions/2891).
    While it was possible to work around this by manually prefixing routes and links,
    it obviously wasn’t as convenient as setting a single config value.'
  id: totrans-split-15

    [Vite exposes its own “base” option](https://vitejs.dev/config/shared-options.html#base).
    Many consumers mistakenly assumed that this would work with Remix, but this option
    is really the same as [Remix’s “publicPath” option](https://remix.run/docs/en/main/file-conventions/remix-config#publicpath).
  id: totrans-split-16
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    should use Vite’s `base` option instead), and the Remix Vite plugin now has a
    brand new `basename` option.

    never accidentally end up on the client. However, it turned out that our previous

    our approach.

    to production. Raising these errors during the build prevents them from impacting

    the use of a `.server` module on the client. This is a good thing! You definitely
    don’t want to leak server-only code to the client. You could fix this by splitting
    server-only code into its own file, but it’d be nice if you didn’t have to restructure
    your code if you didn’t want to — especially if you’re migrating an existing project!

    that could be configured independently. By default, the output directories were
    `public/build` for client assets and `build` for the server. It turned out that
    this structure conflicted with [Vite’s public directory](https://vitejs.dev/guide/assets.html#the-public-directory).
  id: totrans-split-68
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    found their public directory being recursively copied into itself 🫠

    and `vite build && vite build --ssr` to build for production. Due to the lack

    Remix was now “just a Vite plugin”.

    this approach. When using the `serverBundles` option there would now be a dynamic
    number of server builds. We had assumed that we’d be able to define multiple inputs
    and outputs to Vite’s `ssr` build but this turned out not to be the case, so Remix
    needed a way to orchestrate the entire build process. The Vite plugin also now
    provides a new `buildEnd` hook so you can run your own custom logic once the Remix
    build has finished.
