    of proposed rulemaking](/system/files/ftc_gov/pdf/r207000_impersonation_snprm.pdf)
    that would prohibit the impersonation of individuals. The proposed rule changes
    would extend protections of the new [rule on government and business impersonation](/system/files/ftc_gov/pdf/r207000_govt_biz_impersonation_rule.pdf)
    that is being finalized by the Commission today.

    around impersonation fraud, as well as public outcry about the harms caused to
    consumers and to impersonated individuals. Emerging technology – including AI-generated
    deepfakes – threatens to turbocharge this scourge, and the FTC is committed to
    using all of its tools to detect, deter, and halt impersonation fraud.

    it unlawful for a firm, such as an AI platform that creates images, video, or
    text, to provide goods or services that they know or have reason to know is being
    used to harm consumers through impersonation.

    and at a much wider scale. With voice cloning and other AI-driven scams on the
    rise, protecting Americans from impersonator fraud is more critical than ever,”
    said FTC Chair Lina M. Khan. “Our proposed expansions to the final impersonation
    rule would do just that, strengthening the FTC’s toolkit to address AI-enabled
    scams impersonating individuals.”

    comments received during the public comment period on the government and business
    impersonation rule that pointed to the additional threats and harms posed by impersonation
    of individuals. As scammers find new ways to defraud consumers, including through
    AI-generated deepfakes, this proposal will help the agency deter fraud and secure
    redress for harmed consumers.

- en: In addition to the supplemental notice, the FTC has finalized the Government
    and Business Impersonation Rule, which gives the agency stronger tools to combat
    scammers who impersonate businesses or government agencies, enabling the FTC to
    directly file federal court cases aimed at forcing scammers to return the money
    they made from government or business impersonation scams. This is particularly
    important given the Supreme Court’s [April 2021 ruling in AMG Capital Management
    LLC v. FTC](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/20pdf/19-508_l6gn.pdf), which
    significantly limited the agency’s ability to require defendants to return money
    to injured consumers.

    dollars in recent years, and both categories saw significant increases in reports
    to the FTC in 2023\. The rule authorizes the agency to fight these scams more
