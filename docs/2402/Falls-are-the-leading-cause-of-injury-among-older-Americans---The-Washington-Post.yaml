- en: Falls are the leading cause of injury among those 65 and older, even though
    not all falls result in an injury, the CDC says. [About 37 percent](https://www.cdc.gov/falls/data/index.html)
    of older people who have fallen have sustained an injury that required medical
    treatment or activity restrictions. For instance, the CDC reports that 95 percent
    of hip fractures result from a fall, and falls also are the most common cause
    of traumatic brain injuries.
