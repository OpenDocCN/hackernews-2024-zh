    company lied for decades about its role in climate change and the dangers of burning
    fossil fuels. But now, ExxonMobil is going on the offensive with a lawsuit targeting

    investors calling for corporations to do more to shrink their climate impact and
    prepare for a hotter world. Interest groups on both sides of the case say it could
    unleash a wave of corporate litigation against climate activists. It is happening
    at a time when global temperatures continue to rise, and corporate analysts say
    most companies [aren't on track to meet targets they set](https://zerotracker.net/analysis/net-zero-stocktake-2023)
