    a lake,” said park ranger Abby Wines in the news release. “But this is an extremely
    rare event. Normally the amount of water flowing in is much less than the evaporation
    rate.”

    unfortunately people couldn’t come enjoy it then,” said Wines. “Every road in
    the park was damaged by flash floods, and it took two months to open the first
    road into the park.

    available for rent. If folks are planning on paddling in the park, they will need
