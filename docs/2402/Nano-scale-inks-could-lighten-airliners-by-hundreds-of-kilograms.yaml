- en: Kobe University researchers have created a new "structural color ink," just
    100-200 nanometers thick, that shows bright colors from wide viewing angles, without
    fading, while weighing less than half a gram per square meter (0.002 oz per square
    foot).

    others, but this tends to degrade them at the molecular level, leading to fading.

- en: Structural colors, on the other hand, reflect the full spectrum of light from
    parallel nanostructures, set just the right distance apart to cancel out certain
    wavelengths. It's the effect that gives butterfly wings and peacock feathers their
    gorgeous, shimmering hues. Because light isn't being absorbed, just reflected
    off structures, the colors don't fade – but the effect is often highly dependent
    on viewing angle, leading to dazzling iridescence that's beautiful in nature,
    but a little out-there for most industrial colorings.

- en: The Kobe team has investigated a new way of creating structural colors. Instead
    of using parallel nanostructures, their method uses tiny, crystalline silicon
    spheres. Through a phenomenon called Mie resonance, these nano-scale spheres reflect
    certain wavelengths much more strongly than others – and these wavelengths vary
    with the size of the particles.

    of the material. There's no iridescence effect, because the spheres reflect the
    light in all directions. The researchers have proven these inks can be printed.
    And remarkably, the color is strongest when the nanospheres have a little room
    around them, rather than being tightly packed – so less is more.

    of only 100–200 nanometers shows bright colors but weighs less than half a gram
    per square meter," says Kobe materials engineer Sugimoto Hiroshi in a press release.
    "This makes our silicon nanospheres one of the lightest color coats in the world."'

    Airliners, according to *[Simple Flying](https://simpleflying.com/why-most-aircraft-are-painted-white/)*,
    carry between 272-544 kg )600-1,200 lb) of paint – and everything an aircraft
    carries has a direct impact on fuel efficiency.

    the weight to less than 10% of that."'

    as it might if it was carrying five to six fewer adult male passengers.

    of up to 455 L (120 gal) of paint and US$200,000\. These new structural color
    inks won't fade at all, so while they'll certainly be more expensive up front,
    they'll last indefinitely, saving money over the service life of the aircraft.

    have "Boeing," "737" and "Max" written on them – so there could yet be a strong
    business case for these ultra-thin structural color inks once they're ready for
    production.
