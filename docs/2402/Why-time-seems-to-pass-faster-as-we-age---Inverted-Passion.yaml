  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A year as a 36-year-old seems so much shorter as compared to when I was a kid
    or even as a teen.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It seems cosmically unfair – **we have fewer years to live, and each year flies
    by faster.**
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 2/ But, why is that happening?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: My tentative conclusion is that **it’s an unfortunate outcome of how evolution
    shaped our brain to be an efficient storage device. **
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 3/ Our brain is a prediction device.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Its top job is to **construct a model of the world so that we get a survival
    and reproductive edge. **
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 4/ To be able to predict a phenomenon is to be able to control it and have power
    over it, so **our brain is obsessed with predicting how things are going to go.**
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It wants to be able to predict how mates are found, how money is made, what
    makes people laugh, and so on..
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If an event has happened before, what’s the point of paying attention to it
    and storing it in memory?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Redundant storage is inefficient, so the b**rain likely only pays attention
    to and memorises what’s new and surprising. **
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 6/ As kids, everything is new and surprising.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**The world is full of learning opportunities, so the brain makes massive updates
    in memories.**'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Full snapshots of your birthdays, vacations, days at school and so on.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 7/ **Surprising information comes in droves every single day, so the brain simply
    paid a lot of attention**, and hence you felt there were so-many-slices-of-time
    in a day.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It also stored that rich information in memory, so even looking back, days felt
    longer.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 8/ **As we grow, new surprises become a merely tiny-patch on an old memory.**
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Why store the full details of your N-th vacation when you can simply store the
    diff of it from your first one?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 9/ In other words, as we age, our memories and attention become low-fidelity
    versions of their former self.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**As patterns in life start repeating themselves, the slices-of-time that you
    notice and memorise become fewer and coarser. **'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 10/ Naturally, **if anyone asks where did time in your life go, you’d access
    your memory and find the majority of them relating to childhood**, and very few
    from the recent times.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And that’s why time feels like it accumulated in the past, and not in the recent
    present.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 11/ The main culprit in time-speeding up is predictability.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 12/ A thought experiment.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you have a stable job, you can pretty much mentally time travel a full year
    and find your days to be similar.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    you would have no idea what your days are going to look like. **'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    but also for the future.**
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As kids, a vacation was full of surprising information, so it actually felt
    rich and long.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now, your nth trip to Goa feels much shorter as you know what you’re going to
    do.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 14/ So, what to do? How to slow down time?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**The only approach I can think of is to break the predictability and actively
    plan to be (massively) surprised.**'
  prefs: []

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 15/ **Unfortunately, we are evolved to avoid exploring and taking risks as we
    age.**
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Our brain pushes us to exploit more of the world we have come to understand
    better instead of pushing us to explore more.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 17/ Interestingly, **the solution to slowing down time is not boredom** (as
    I thought).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Boredom is a negative state. The solution is to dive head-first into unknown
    territory.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    lose interest in it.
  prefs: []

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'The brain with all its predictive models asks: is this all to life?'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But it’s mistaken – **it’s all only to the life that it has chosen to live.**
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    toes.
