# French Bulldog puppy spontaneously regrows his jaw after cancer • Earth.com

In an unprecedented medical event, a French Bulldog puppy named Tyson experienced the spontaneous regrowth of his jaw after undergoing surgery to remove a cancerous tumor.

This remarkable case, documented by [Cornell University](https://vet.cornell.edu) veterinarians, marks the first of its kind for dogs, offering new hope and insights into veterinary oncology and surgical recovery.

## The challenge: A malignant diagnosis

Tyson, a three-month-old French [Bulldog](https://www.earth.com/news/english-bulldogs-are-suffering-from-poor-breeding-practices/), was initially brought to Cornell’s Dentistry and Oral Surgery Service for a cleft palate operation.

It was during this time that a malignant tumor was discovered on his lower left mandible. Dr. Alexandra Wright, D.V.M. ’18, who spearheaded Tyson’s treatment, identified the tumor as an [oral papillary squamous cell carcinoma](https://vcahospitals.com/know-your-pet/oral-tumors-squamous-cell-carcinoma) — a rare but aggressive cancer in dogs.

“Oral squamous cell carcinoma is the second-most common malignant oral tumor in dogs, and this papillary subtype has previously been reported in young dogs,” explained Dr. Wright.

This diagnosis prompted an urgent and drastic response: the removal of a significant portion of Tyson’s jaw to save his life.

## A leap of faith to save Tyson

Despite the grim prognosis, Tyson’s owners, Melissa Forsythe and Mike Lacagnina, chose to proceed with the surgery after learning the cancer hadn’t spread beyond the tumor site.

“We didn’t know if we wanted to put a puppy through all this. The prognosis at the time was uncertain,” Forsythe said.

However, since Tyson’s CT scans were clear, meaning that the cancer hadn’t spread to other sites in the body, “we decided to give him a chance and continue with surgery. We had no idea his jaw would grow back!”

The surgical team, led by Wright, managed to preserve a vital layer of tissue called the periosteum, which played a crucial role in Tyson’s recovery.

The periosteum, rich in blood vessels and nerves, is essential for bone growth and regeneration.

## Medical miracle: French bulldog’s jaw regrows

This meticulous surgical approach, coupled with Tyson’s early cancer detection, set the stage for what was to come: the spontaneous and almost complete regrowth of his mandible.

Tyson’s recovery defied all odds. Typically, such extensive bone loss in dogs does not regenerate, especially to the extent seen in Tyson’s case.

His new mandible, while slightly abnormal in its lack of certain features such as the mandibular canal and teeth, matched the length of the opposite side, maintaining proper jaw alignment and showing no signs of cancer recurrence.

Following his jaw surgery, Tyson faced another challenge with his cleft palate, which also required surgical intervention.

## Surviving and thriving despite obstacles

Throughout his recovery, Tyson displayed remarkable resilience, adapting to life with an E-collar and restrictions on his activity.

Forsythe shared that despite these limitations, their French [Bulldog](https://www.earth.com/news/french-bulldogs-health-risks/) remained spirited as his jaw healed, enjoying water-soaked kibble and soft toys, and keeping active with walks around the house.

Today, Tyson’s story is not just about survival but thriving. He has graduated from obedience class, earned his Canine Good Citizen certification, and even participated in a Christmas parade.

His journey from a critical cancer diagnosis to becoming a symbol of hope and resilience is a testament to the advances in veterinary medicine and the possibilities of regenerative healing.

## Implications for veterinary science

Dr. Wright, reflecting on Tyson’s case, highlighted its significance in expanding our understanding of bone regeneration in young dogs and its potential implications for other animals facing similar diagnoses.

Tyson’s case underscores the importance of early detection, surgical precision, and the inherent capacity for healing present in young animals.

For Forsythe, Tyson’s story is one of love, determination, and the joy of seeing a beloved pet overcome incredible odds.

She hopes that Tyson’s remarkable recovery will inspire and inform future treatments for other dogs facing life-threatening conditions.

Through Tyson’s journey, the veterinary community has gained invaluable insights into the potential for spontaneous bone regeneration, opening new avenues for research and treatment in veterinary care.
