    in the U.S., per capita. If passed, the city’s zoning map would allow for over
    100,000 additional homes in a city of 47,000 existing homes. As far as I’m aware,
    hardly any cities that have eliminated single-family zoning have allowed this
    many homes relative to their size.

    developers](https://escholarship.org/uc/item/26b8d8zh), exclusionary zoning prohibited
    the construction of apartments and multi-family homes in Berkeley’s elite neighborhoods

    This zoning code was quickly exported [around the nation](https://www.cnn.com/2023/08/05/business/single-family-zoning-laws/index.html).
    Berkeley had a reckoning about this history in 2020 when race relations and the
    severe housing crisis in the city intersected. Following the lead of Minneapolis,
    Berkeley city council [broke national headlines](https://www.mercurynews.com/2021/02/24/berkeley-to-end-single-family-residential-zoning-citing-racist-ties/)

    allow for middle density housing such as small apartments and condos, in contrast

    Partially because the city passed an ordinance in 1973 which made getting a permit
    extremely difficult — known as the Neighborhood Preservation Ordinance. But zoning
    imposes more hidden restrictions on land such as floor area ratio or “lot coverage.”

    zoning citywide, it faced immediate challenges. It was decided not to impose any
    additional low income housing requirements beyond the city standard of 20% if

    rowhouses and prefer parks for communal greenspace. Backyards usually function
    better as private open spaces and most front lawns go unused, waste water, or

    have small streets and sidewalks with parked cars sitting on top of the sidewalk,
