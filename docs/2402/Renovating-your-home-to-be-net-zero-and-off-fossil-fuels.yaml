    that installs geothermal systems in the Northeast, drilled two 5-inch diameter
    boreholes, 350 feet deep, in Tuttelman’s yard. Then, the company connected the
    boreholes with lines that come into his house through the basement. Water and
    antifreeze solution coarse through pipes where the heat exchange occurs.

    was going to use no fossil fuel, was going to be more efficient, and someone else

    which typically lasts about 15 years, is on its last legs. The underground infrastructure
    for geothermal heat pumps can operate for [25 to 50 years](https://www.energy.gov/sites/prod/files/guide_to_geothermal_heat_pumps.pdf),
    according to the US Department of Energy.

    fully net-zero home. He still wants to install [new windows](https://www.masssave.com/-/media/Files/PDFs/Save/Residential/rebate-forms/Mass-Save-Windows-Rebate-Form.pdf)
    to lower his energy needs and get rid of his hot water system that runs on gas.
    To do that, he needs to install a [heat pump water heater](https://www.eversource-ma.com/heat-pump-water-heater/?utm_source=google&utm_campaign=MA_HVAC_Electric-EGMA_23&utm_medium=cpc&utm_content=Heat%20Pump:%20Water%20Heater%20(Exact)&utm_term=heat%20pump%20water%20heater&gad_source=1&gclid=CjwKCAiAzc2tBhA6EiwArv-i6Q9gopx-drzn33Z5utl7pTf3RATE8aRHO48HoQTMMvfi5yAedNhw5xoCwQ4QAvD_BwE).

    sustainability, achieved the holy grail of net zero eight years ago. His 1920s
    Lexington home was due for an update, but instead of just “upgrading and renovating,”
    Sterman decided the “incremental cost of going deeper and doing a retrofit” was
    the right move.

    went from there. For example, his home’s original windows from the 1920s were
    in rough shape, so he decided to tighten the building’s envelope, resulting in
    wider windowsills, where, added bonus, he can now display a robust plant collection.

    says the economics have shifted dramatically since his installation — subsidies,
    [tax credits](https://www.energystar.gov/about/federal_tax_credits), leases, and
    loans have made solar panels and heat pumps much more affordable. And while taking
    the plunge can be daunting, between the upfront cost and time investment, he says
    people should “consider the costs and benefits, not just the costs.”
