    bonuses and salaries dramatically, they'll be unable to recruit great talent,
    and they need great talent to fix the situation.

    is paid has no real impact on their life. They can't eat more meals in a day or
    wear more shoes. What matters to the manager is the *relative* amount. How much
    more would I make over there? Why does that company pay its CEO more than my company
    pays me?

- en: Twenty years ago, financial industry salaries were a tiny fraction of what they
    are today. Did lesser people do the work? Did they try less hard? Think smaller
    thoughts? Of course not. The reasons salaries are high is that the number is a
    *signaling mechanism*, a very expensive marketing campaign.

    with each other to recruit a too-small pool of talent from the top law schools.
    Unable to muster up even a mite of marketing insight, they chose to compete on
    only one axis: salary. So, 24 year olds were given jobs at $120,000 a year, when
    their peers from college were making 20% of that. The firms could have found great
    people at half the price, except that with only one axis, they had to be at the
    top if their peers were.'

    that proved its worth by paying a lot or you didn't. You didn't have to know anything
    about the firm, apparently, other than the fact that they were top tier, and the
    way you knew that was because they paid a lot.

    to market the jobs, just to race to the top (or the bottom, depending on your
    point of view) with the easiest marketing signal of all. Price. Yes, it's exactly
    the same as a retailer trying to improve business by being the cheapest.

    as an accurate portrayal of what's necessary to recruit. For every great job at
    Goldman Sachs, there are still 1,000 totally qualified applicants waiting for
    that job. So, when demand is high and supply is low, the power goes to the supplier.
    Lower the salary until you get just a few qualified applicants, right?

    taxpayers to let the organizations we own and support know that wasting money
    on this sort of marketing is silly. Just as an industry-wide gas standard would
    have actually helped Detroit twenty years ago, an industry-wide tax and trade
    salary cap will actually help these organizations. They'll be forced to recruit
    with useful marketing techniques (I'd rather work at an innovative, fast-moving,
    respectful company, given the choice…so the companies would have to make a better
    'product,' not just pay a lot as a result of financial engineering).

- en: Sometimes markets get stuck because there is a disconnect between what something
    costs and what you get. It costs the individuals on the board of a public company
    nothing to pay more, they get bragging rights and a CEO who is focused on money.
    And that works until the next board leapfrogs them. The boards themselves should
    be lobbying to end this practice, but they won't because… guess what… the folks
    on the boards are the CEOs of other companies. It's stuck.

    is private, pay yourself a trillion dollars a year, fine with me. In fact, we
    need more private companies that innovate and pay their staff a ton. But if you're
    owned by shareholders or bailed out by taxpayers, wasting trillions of dollars
    because you don't have the guts to market your jobs properly is silly.
