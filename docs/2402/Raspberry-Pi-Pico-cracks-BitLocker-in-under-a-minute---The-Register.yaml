- en: We're very familiar with the many projects in which Raspberry Pi hardware is
    used, from giving old computers a new lease of life through to running the animated
    displays so beloved by retailers. But cracking BitLocker? We doubt the company
    will be bragging too much about that particular application.

- en: The technique was documented in a [YouTube video](https://youtu.be/wTl4vEednkQ)
    over the weekend, which demonstrated how a Raspberry Pi Pico can be used to gain
    access to a BitLocker-secured device in under a minute, provided you have physical
    access to the device.

    other hardware will also be vulnerable. The technique also relies on having a
    Trusted Platform Module (TPM) separate from the CPU. In many cases, the two will
    be combined, in which case the technique shown cannot be used.

- en: However, if you get your hands on a similarly vulnerable device secured with
    BitLocker, gaining access to the encrypted storage appears embarrassingly simple.
    The crux of it is sniffing out the key to the device as it is passed from TPM
    to CPU. The key is helpfully not encrypted.

    custom connector to access the signals between chips. Stir in an analyzer running
    on the Raspberry Pi Pico and for less than $10 in components, you can get hold
    of the master key for the laptop hardware.

    that such attacks are possible, although it describes them as a "targeted attack
    with plenty of time; the attacker opens the case, solder, and uses sophisticated
    hardware or software."

- en: At less than a minute in the example, we'd dispute the "plenty of time" claim,
    and while the Raspberry Pi Pico is undoubtedly impressive for the price, at less
    than $10, the hardware spend is neither expensive nor specific.

    for hardware they would be forgiven for assuming had been safely encrypted.
