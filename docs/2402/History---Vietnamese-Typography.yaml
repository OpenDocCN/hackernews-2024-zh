    Bá Trạc opened Đông Kinh nghĩa thục, a tuition-free institution in Hà Nội to help
    progress the country. Recognizing the advantage of *Quốc ngữ*, which was easy
    to read and write, the school used the Romanized writing system to publish textbooks,
    literary works, and newspapers (Đăng cổ Tùng báo and Đại Việt Tân báo).

- en: In 1933, the forming of Tự Lực Văn Đoàn (Self-Reliance Literary Group) signified
    profound changes in the Vietnamese literary scene. The group’s scholars, which
    made up of Nhất Linh, Khái Hưng, Hoàng Đạo, Thạch Lam, Tú Mỡ, Thế Lữ, and Xuân
    Diệu, popularized *Quốc ngữ* through their clear, simple Vietnamese writing. They
    published two weekly newspapers (Phong hóa and Ngày nay), modern poetry, and novels
    without relying on the Chinese classical text.^([5](#history5))
