- en: As discussed in our [previous post](/blog/2023/03/22/react-labs-what-we-have-been-working-on-march-2023#react-optimizing-compiler),
    React can *sometimes* re-render too much when state changes. Since the early days
    of React our solution for such cases has been manual memoization. In our current
    APIs, this means applying the [`useMemo`](/reference/react/useMemo), [`useCallback`](/reference/react/useCallback),
    and [`memo`](/reference/react/memo) APIs to manually tune how much React re-renders
    on state changes. But manual memoization is a compromise. It clutters up our code,
    is easy to get wrong, and requires extra work to keep up to date.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Manual memoization is a reasonable compromise, but we weren’t satisfied. Our
    vision is for React to *automatically* re-render just the right parts of the UI
    when state changes, *without compromising on React’s core mental model*. We believe
    that React’s approach — UI as a simple function of state, with standard JavaScript
    values and idioms — is a key part of why React has been approachable for so many
    developers. That’s why we’ve invested in building an optimizing compiler for React.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: JavaScript is a notoriously challenging language to optimize, thanks to its
    loose rules and dynamic nature. React Compiler is able to compile code safely
    by modeling both the rules of JavaScript *and* the “rules of React”. For example,
    React components must be idempotent — returning the same value given the same
    inputs — and can’t mutate props or state values. These rules limit what developers
    can do and help to carve out a safe space for the compiler to optimize.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Of course, we understand that developers sometimes bend the rules a bit, and
    our goal is to make React Compiler work out of the box on as much code as possible.
    The compiler attempts to detect when code doesn’t strictly follow React’s rules
    and will either compile the code where safe or skip compilation if it isn’t safe.
    We’re testing against Meta’s large and varied codebase in order to help validate
    this approach.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For developers who are curious about making sure their code follows React’s
    rules, we recommend [enabling Strict Mode](/reference/react/StrictMode) and [configuring
    React’s ESLint plugin](/learn/editor-setup#linting). These tools can help to catch
    subtle bugs in your React code, improving the quality of your applications today,
    and future-proofs your applications for upcoming features such as React Compiler.
    We are also working on consolidated documentation of the rules of React and updates
    to our ESLint plugin to help teams understand and apply these rules to create
    more robust apps.

    At the time of the talk, we had early experimental data from trying React Compiler
    on one page of instagram.com. Since then, we shipped the compiler to production
    across instagram.com. We’ve also expanded our team to accelerate the rollout to
    additional surfaces at Meta and to open source. We’re excited about the path ahead
    and will have more to share in the coming months.

    that we were exploring solutions for sending data from the client to the server
    with Server Actions, so that you can execute database mutations and implement
    forms. During development of Server Actions, we extended these APIs to support
    data handling in client-only applications as well.
  prefs: []

    allow you to pass a function to DOM elements such as [`<form/>`](/reference/react-dom/components/form):'

- en: The `action` function can operate synchronously or asynchronously. You can define
    them on the client side using standard JavaScript or on the server with the [`'use
    server'`](/reference/rsc/use-server) directive. When using an action, React will
    manage the life cycle of the data submission for you, providing hooks like [`useFormStatus`](/reference/react-dom/hooks/useFormStatus),
    and [`useActionState`](/reference/react/useActionState) to access the current
    state and response of the form action.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: By default, Actions are submitted within a [transition](/reference/react/useTransition),
    keeping the current page interactive while the action is processing. Since Actions
    support async functions, we’ve also added the ability to use `async/await` in
    transitions. This allows you to show pending UI with the `isPending` state of
    a transition when an async request like `fetch` starts, and show the pending UI
    all the way through the update being applied.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Alongside Actions, we’re introducing a feature named [`useOptimistic`](/reference/react/useOptimistic)
    for managing optimistic state updates. With this hook, you can apply temporary
    updates that are automatically reverted once the final state commits. For Actions,
    this allows you to optimistically set the final state of the data on the client,
    assuming the submission is successful, and revert to the value for data received
    from the server. It works using regular `async`/`await`, so it works the same
    whether you’re using `fetch` on the client, or a Server Action from the server.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Library authors can implement custom `action={fn}` props in their own components
    with `useTransition`. Our intent is for libraries to adopt the Actions pattern
    when designing their component APIs, to provide a consistent experience for React
    developers. For example, if your library provides a `<Calendar onSelect={eventHandler}>`
    component, consider also exposing a `<Calendar selectAction={action}>` API, too.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: While we initially focused on Server Actions for client-server data transfer,
    our philosophy for React is to provide the same programming model across all platforms
    and environments. When possible, if we introduce a feature on the client, we aim
    to make it also work on the server, and vice versa. This philosophy allows us
    to create a single set of APIs that work no matter where your app runs, making
    it easier to upgrade to different environments later.

  prefs: []

    be researched and built privately inside of Meta, so users would only see the
    final polished product when released to Stable. With Canaries, we’re building
    in public with the help of the community to finalize features we share in the
    React Labs blog series. This means you hear about new features sooner, as they’re
    being finalized instead of after they’re complete.

    generate a `<script>` tag (like [Astro Islands](https://docs.astro.build/en/concepts/islands/#creating-an-island)),
    while `"use server"` tells the bundler to generate a POST endpoint (like [tRPC
    Mutations](https://trpc.io/docs/concepts)). Together, they let you write reusable
    components that compose client-side interactivity with the related server-side
    logic.'

    tags anywhere in your component tree. These work the same way in all environments,

    [`<link>`](/reference/react-dom/components/link), and [`<script>`](/reference/react-dom/components/script)
    are ready to be displayed. We’ve also added new [Resource Loading APIs](/reference/react-dom#resource-preloading-apis)
    like `preload` and `preinit` to provide greater control for when a resource should
    load and initialize.'

    access the status with [`useFormStatus`](/reference/react-dom/hooks/useFormStatus),
    handle the result with [`useActionState`](/reference/react/useActionState), and
    optimistically update the UI with [`useOptimistic`](/reference/react/useOptimistic).'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Since all of these features work together, it’s difficult to release them in
    the Stable channel individually. Releasing Actions without the complementary hooks
    for accessing form states would limit the practical usability of Actions. Introducing
    React Server Components without integrating Server Actions would complicate modifying
    data on the server.
  prefs: []

    to “Activity”. The name “Offscreen” implied that it only applied to parts of the
    app that were not visible, but while researching the feature we realized that
    it’s possible for parts of the app to be visible and inactive, such as content
    behind a modal. The new name more closely reflects the behavior of marking certain
    parts of the app “active” or “inactive”.
