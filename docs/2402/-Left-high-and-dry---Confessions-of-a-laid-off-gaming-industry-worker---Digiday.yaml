    is getting hit particularly hard at the moment.

    are struggling to take advantage of the rise of the medium. As free-to-play or

    gradually eclipses premium game sales as the industry’s leading business model,
    gaming companies are pivoting — and making significant cuts to their payrolls
    — accordingly. The [over 5,000 gaming industry layoffs](https://twitter.com/tha_rami/status/1750532050833322419)
    that occurred in January included a cut of [530 staffers at Riot Games](https://apnews.com/article/riot-games-league-legends-layoff-c0a780159d97149c48c9f06cc154efe2)
    and a cull of 1,900 Microsoft employees across the company’s Activision Blizzard
    and Xbox divisions.

    January’s wave of layoffs.

    I tried every year that I was in college. Everyone I know who worked there told
    me that it was their dream job. I mean, really, it was a pretty awesome place
    to work, right up until now. There’s a saying that if you pick a job you love,
    you’ll never work a day in your life. It’s not true — I worked some days. But
    I loved my coworkers, and I cared about the game. I still care about the game,
    annoyingly enough.

    bump is definitely over. We made way less than we did in 2020 and 2019; we’re
    going to be pivoting some strategies.”

    to be looking for work in games. There’s no getting around that — it’s already
    a pretty glutted field, because a lot of people want to make video games for a
    living. Everybody wants to do that, so there’s a ton of competition.

    are often targeting junior level staff, is that it’s basically undoing all the
    diversity steps that the industry has taken in the past few years. Because who
    are juniors? Well, they’re industry newcomers, who are women, queer people, people
    of color. It’s always disproportionate, because the industry is hostile for us.
    We can’t get seniority. And if we’re always the last hired and the first fired,
    then we’ll never get seniority.
  prefs: []

- en: I’m still worried about the game, and part of that is that they’re banking so
    much on senior talent, but they’re not going to have it forever. These people
    have already worked 10 to 20 years there; it’s inevitable that they’re going to
    want to do something else or go to a different company. And when these people
    leave, what will they have left? There’ll be no one to hand over knowledge to,
    no one to carry on practices — no new generation of seniors.

    that it’s only been a week and a half, or like two weeks, and already, the layoffs
    moment has passed. It’s over. No one cares anymore. My coworkers, they’re just
    back to doing their jobs, and it’s like, my life doesn’t go back to normal now.
    I’m just fucked, and I feel forgotten.

    had done or said something — but I don’t know what they could have done. I know
    it’s unreasonable to want that, but at the same time, it’s just like I’m getting
    the equivalent of “thoughts and prayers.” The only people supporting us now are
    other people who got laid off — we basically formed our own support groups.

    That’s an impact — if people are scared for their jobs now, they’ll fall into
    line. Execs know that; there’s no way they don’t want you to know. When they make
    sure that everybody knows that they’re expendable, then the fuck are you going
    to do? You want your job. You don’t want to end up like them.
