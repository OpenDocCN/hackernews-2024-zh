- en: I've previously written about [OpenWatcom as a gateway to the ancient world](https://retrocoding.net/openwatcom-gateway-to-ancient-world-of-x86).
    However, at that time, I focused on installing it using Docker, as OpenWatcom
    1.9 only works on Windows and Linux. I'm not a full-time Windows or Linux user,
    so when I discovered that OpenWatcom's 2.0 series can be compiled and run on macOS,
    **and** it can run on ARM macOS, I was thrilled.

    GitHub Issues. However, after testing it out, I believe it''s worth sharing with
    others who share my hobby: writing old Windows (and DOS) applications but still
    wants to use their newest, shiniest MacBook to do so.'

    code on an Apple Silicon.

    their official compiler and IDE. Xcode. Recently, they tried to slim everything
    down, so it''ll be 2 GB-ish download from [developer.apple.com](http://developer.apple.com).'

- en: '**Second, homebrew**. This is optional if you know what you''re doing. However,
    to smoothly compile OpenWatcom, you''d need DOSBOX command line and I feel the
    easiest way to obtain DosBox is using homebrew. Instal it from [brew.sh](https://brew.sh).'

    for "latest" OpenWatcom v2.0 series. I'm using the February 2024 archive. Go to
    the release page and dowload the source (.tar.gz). Extract it

    `/opt/watcom`. So if you haven't made it yet, you can run this to create a directory
    for your watcom installation and copy everything into that place.

    Apple Silicon mac is in `armo64` subdirectory. You need to also setup the `WATCOM`
    environment variable. That will point to our installation directory.
