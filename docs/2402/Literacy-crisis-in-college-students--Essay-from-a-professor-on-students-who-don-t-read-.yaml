    states, aimed at pulling any text with “woke” themes from classrooms and library
    shelves. Though the results sometimes seem farcical, as with the banning of Art
    Spiegelman’s *Maus* due to its [inclusion of “cuss words”](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2022/02/the-inside-story-of-the-banning-of-maus-its-dumber-than-you-think/)
    and explicit rodent nudity, the book-banning agenda is no laughing matter. Motivated
    by bigotry, it has already done demonstrable harm and promises to do more. But
    at the same time, the appropriate response is, in principle, simple. Named individuals
    have advanced explicit policies with clear goals and outcomes, and we can replace
    those individuals with people who want to reverse those policies. That is already
    beginning to happen in many places, and I hope those successes will continue until
    every banned book is restored.

    yet. Defeating the open conspiracy to deprive students of physical access to books
    will do little to counteract the more diffuse confluence of forces that are depriving
    students of the skills needed to meaningfully engage with those books in the first
    place. As a college educator, I am confronted daily with the results of that conspiracy-without-conspirators.
    I have been teaching in small liberal arts colleges for over 15 years now, and
    in the past five years, it’s as though someone flipped a switch. For most of my
    career, I assigned around 30 pages of reading per class meeting as a baseline
    expectation—sometimes scaling up for purely expository readings or pulling back
    for more difficult texts. (No human being can read 30 pages of Hegel in one sitting,
    for example.) Now students are intimidated by anything over 10 pages and seem
    to walk away from readings of as little as 20 pages with no real understanding.
    Even smart and motivated students struggle to do more with written texts than
    extract decontextualized take-aways. Considerable class time is taken up simply
    establishing what happened in a story or the basic steps of an argument—skills
    I used to be able to take for granted.

    it, I talk about it a lot. And when I talk about it with nonacademics, certain
    predictable responses inevitably arise, all questioning the reality of the trend
    I describe. Hasn’t every generation felt that the younger cohort is going to hell
    in a handbasket? Haven’t professors always complained that educators at earlier
    levels are not adequately equipping their students? And haven’t students from
    time immemorial skipped the readings?

- en: The response of my fellow academics, however, reassures me that I’m not simply
    indulging in intergenerational grousing. Anecdotally, I have literally never met
    a professor who did not share my experience. Professors are also discussing the
    issue in academic [trade](https://www.insidehighered.com/views/2022/10/17/reading-skills-are-urgent-challenge-higher-ed-opinion)
    [publications](https://www.chronicle.com/article/are-you-assigning-too-much-reading-or-just-too-much-boring-reading/),
    from a variety of perspectives. What we almost all seem to agree on is that we
    are facing *new* obstacles in structuring and delivering our courses, requiring
    us to ratchet down expectations in the face of a ratcheting down of preparation.
    Yes, there were always students who skipped the readings, but we are in new territory
    when even highly motivated honors students struggle to grasp the basic argument
    of a 20-page article. Yes, professors never feel satisfied that high school teachers
    have done enough, but not every generation of professors has had to deal with
    the fallout of No Child Left Behind and Common Core. Finally, yes, every generation
    thinks the younger generation is failing to make the grade—*except* for the current
    cohort of professors, who are by and large more invested in their students’ success
    and mental health and more responsive to student needs than any group of educators
    in human history. We are not complaining about our students. We are complaining
    about what has been taken from them.

    first is the same thing that has taken away almost everyone’s ability to focus—the
    ubiquitous smartphone. Even as a career academic who studies the Quran in Arabic
    for fun, I have noticed my reading endurance flagging. I once found myself boasting
    at a faculty meeting that I had read through my entire hourlong train ride without
    looking at my phone. My colleagues agreed this was a major feat, one they had
    not achieved recently. Even if I rarely attain that high level of focus, though,
    I am able to “turn it on” when demanded, for instance to plow through a big novel
    during a holiday break. That’s because I was able to develop and practice those
    skills of extended concentration and attentive reading *before* the intervention
    of the smartphone. For children who were raised with smartphones, by contrast,
    that foundation is missing. It is probably no coincidence that the iPhone itself,
    originally released in 2007, is approaching college age, meaning that professors
    are increasingly dealing with students who would have become addicted to the dopamine
    hit of the omnipresent screen long before they were introduced to the more subtle
    pleasures of the page.

    COVID-19\. There is still some debate about the necessity of those measures, but
    what is not up for debate any longer is the [very real learning loss](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/18/opinion/pandemic-school-learning-loss.html)
    that students suffered at every level. The impact will inevitably continue to
    be felt for the next decade or more, until the last cohort affected by the mass
    “pivot to online” finally graduates. I doubt that the pandemic closures were the
    decisive factor in themselves, however. Not only did the marked decline in reading
    resilience start before the pandemic, but the students I am seeing would have
    already been in high school during the school closures. Hence they would be better
    equipped to get something out of the online format and, more importantly, their
    basic reading competence would have already been established.

    little control are the major changes in reading pedagogy that have occurred in
    recent decades—some motivated by the ever-increasing demand to “teach to the test”
    and some by fads coming out of schools of education. In the latter category is
    the widely discussed [decline in phonics education](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/16/us/science-of-reading-literacy-parents.html)
    in favor of the “balanced literacy” approach advocated by education expert Lucy
    Calkins (who has more recently [come to accept](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/22/us/reading-teaching-curriculum-phonics.html)
    the need for more phonics instruction). I started to see the results of this ill-advised
    change several years ago, when students abruptly stopped attempting to sound out
    unfamiliar words and instead paused until they recognized the whole word as a
    unit. (In a recent class session, a smart, capable student was caught short by
    the word *circumstances* when reading a text out loud.) The result of this [vibes-based
    literacy](https://www.newyorker.com/news/annals-of-education/the-rise-and-fall-of-vibes-based-literacy)
    is that students never attain genuine fluency in reading. Even aside from the
    impact of smartphones, their experience of reading is constantly interrupted by
    their *intentionally cultivated* inability to process unfamiliar words.

    by people who thought it would help. It is hard to see a similar motivation in
    the [growing trend](https://www.edweek.org/teaching-learning/opinion-why-we-shouldnt-teach-literature-with-excerpts/2019/06)
    toward assigning students *only* the kind of short passages that can be included
    in a standardized test. Due in part to changes driven by the infamous [Common
    Core standards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Core#Reception_and_criticism),
    teachers now [have to fight](https://www.forbes.com/sites/petergreene/2018/11/09/common-core-testing-and-the-fracturing-of-literature/?sh=22e8495d13f1)
    to assign their students longer readings, much less entire books, because those
    activities won’t feed directly into students getting higher test scores, which
    leads to schools getting more funding. The emphasis on standardized tests was
    always a distraction at best, but we have reached the point where it is actively
    cannibalizing students’ educational experience—an outcome no one intended or planned,
    and for which there is no possible justification.

    is there any realistic path to putting the smartphone genie back in the bottle.
    (Though I will note that we as a society do at least attempt to keep other addictive
    products out of the hands of children.) But I have to think that we can, at the
    very least, stop *actively preventing* young people from developing the ability
    to follow extended narratives and arguments in the classroom. Regardless of their
    profession or ultimate educational level, they will need those skills. The world
    is a complicated place. People—their histories and identities, their institutions
    and work processes, their fears and desires—are simply too complex to be captured
    in a worksheet with a paragraph and some reading comprehension questions. Large-scale
    prose writing is the best medium we have for capturing that complexity, and the
    education system should not be in the business of keeping students from learning
    how to engage effectively with it.

    everyone centers their lives on books as much as a humanities professor does.
    I think they’re missing out, but they’re adults and they can choose how to spend
    their time. What’s happening with the current generation is not that they are
    simply choosing TikTok over Jane Austen. They are being deprived of the ability
    to choose—for no real reason or benefit. We can and must stop perpetrating this
    crime on our young people.
