    Now the biz is trying to figure out how to allow its customers to get rid of it.

    [there's a cost](https://www.theregister.com/2023/12/21/artificial_intelligence_is_a_liability/).
    For example, Zoom last August had to clarify that it would not use people's chats
    and calls for AI training despite [a change](https://www.theregister.com/2023/08/08/zoom_ai_legalese_update/)
    to its terms of service that allowed that.

    the plugin to be present in their JetBrains applications at all, whether that's
    due to corporate policies that are incompatible with AI Assistant or other concerns.
    But because the plugin code has been "deeply integrated," removal has proven complicated.
