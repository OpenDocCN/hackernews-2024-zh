- en: Roku, a streaming competitor, last week noted that television advertisers are
    increasing the amount they spend on streaming ads as customers continue to cut
    the cable cord. Roku and Amazon sell advertising space on their various streaming
    channels and home screens, and they sell licensing arrangements for companies
    to put their brand on certain shows. They also sell space to apps and media channels
    to advertise their movies and shows on customers’ screens.
