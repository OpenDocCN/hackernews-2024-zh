- en: Scythians did terrible things. Two-thousand five-hundred years ago, these warrior
    nomads, who lived in the grasslands of what is now southern Ukraine, enjoyed a
    truly ferocious reputation. According to the Greek historian Herodotus, the Scythians
    drank the blood of their fallen enemies, took their heads back to their king and
    made trinkets out of their scalps. Sometimes, they draped whole human skins over
    their horses and used smaller pieces of human leather to make the quivers that
    held the deadly arrows for which they were famous.

- en: Readers have long doubted the truth of this story, as they did many of Herodotus’s
    more outlandish tales, gathered from all corners of the ancient world. (Not for
    nothing was the “father of history” also known as the “father of lies” in antiquity.)
    Recently, though, evidence has come to light that vindicates his account. In 2023,
    a team of scientists at the University of Copenhagen, led by [Luise Ørsted Brandt](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0294129),
    tested the composition of leather goods, including several quivers, recovered
    from Scythian tombs in Ukraine. By using a form of mass spectrometry, which let
    them read the “molecular barcode” of biological samples, the team found that while
    most of the Scythian leather came from sheep, goats, cows and horses, two of the
    quivers contained pieces of human skin. “Herodotus’s texts are sometimes questioned
    for their historical content, and some of the things he writes seem to be a little
    mythological, but in this case we could prove that he was right,” Brandt told
    me recently.

- en: So, score one for Herodotus. But the hi-tech detective work by the Copenhagen
    researchers also points to something else about the future of history as a discipline.
    In its core techniques, history writing hasn’t changed that much since classical
    times. As a historian, you can do what Herodotus did – travel around talking to
    interesting people and gathering their recollections of events (though we now
    sometimes call this journalism). Or you can do what most of the historians that
    followed him did, which is to compile documents written in the past and about
    the past, and then try to make their different accounts and interpretations square
    up. That’s certainly the way I was trained in graduate school in the 2000s. We
    read primary texts written in the periods we studied, and works by later historians,
    and then tried to fit an argument based on those documents into a conversation
    conducted by those historians.

    and criticising arguments, you could write history directly from the physical
    remains of the past, reconstructing events with the forensic detail of a crime
    scene investigator? This would be a history written not from words, but from things.
    [Archaeology](https://www.theguardian.com/science/archaeology), art history and
    other disciplines rooted in the close study of material culture have long held
    out this promise. But traditionally there has been a dividing line between what
    they could offer and what was seen by many historians as their true task. These
    fields tended to move on different scales, and paid attention to different subjects.
    Historians, examining archival documents, written annals and inscriptions, focused
    more on named individuals in specific moments. Archaeologists and their brethren,
    examining changing styles of architecture, burials, fragments of ceramics and
    so on, gathered plenty of information, but on a broader scale. In a few places,
    such as the study of coins and seals, the two methods overlap. But generally speaking,
    these two approaches to the past – text-based and thing-based – have been assigned
    in different domains. Recently though, this division has become blurrier.

    remains has grown exponentially. In some cases, such as the study of ancient climates,
    old techniques have been employed with new scope and precision. In others, procedures
    such as whole-genome DNA sequencing – once expensive and error-prone when applied
    to ancient samples – have become reliable and ubiquitous. We also have brand new
    methods of dating, imaging and chemical analysis, which have allowed the detritus
    of antiquity – everything from teeth to shoes to ancient rubbish itself – to speak
    about the past as eloquently as any archive.

    themselves to track the genes of the flocks of cows and sheep whose skins were

    pelts in a [Viking grave](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0270040),
    to take one example – and source them back to their point of origin. The study
    of ancient proteins is now its own field, called paleoproteomics. Other forensic
    techniques have opened up other lost pages of the past. Analysis of stable isotopes
    preserved in human bones and animal teeth has allowed scientists to track the
    movement of a single [girl](https://www.nature.com/articles/srep10431) from Germany

    to see past events in human terms, with the great drivers of history coming from
    changes in culture and society. Natural scientists tend to focus on fluctuations
    in the natural world, often ascribing the fall of empires and kingdoms to factors
    such as prolonged droughts and outbreaks of plague. Some historians, like the
    Byzantinists Merle Eisenberg and John Haldon, caution against “overhasty assumptions”
    concerning the relationship of society and environment, and warn of “exaggerated
    claims” about the impact of climate and disease on civilisation.

    a medievalist at Harvard and the holder of the University’s chair in the Science
    of the Human Past, the cumulative effect of these various innovations has been
    a “scientific revolution”, which is still in its infancy. Speaking with audible
    excitement from his home in Cambridge, Massachusetts, McCormick told me that history
    today is roughly in the same place astronomy was “when Galileo first looked up

    Belgium, McCormick learned all the skills then required of a medieval historian:
    “Greek and Latin philology, linguistic history, vulgar Latin, late Greek, classical
    Greek and palaeography.” These days, he thinks, this sort of training needs to
    be supplemented with comparable attention to material evidence. “Once you have
    physical pieces of the past in your hands, then the entire toolkit of the scientific
    revolution can be applied to it,” he said. “If you have leather, you can look
    at what the cow drank. If you have lumber, you can see what forest it grew in.
    With molecular data, you’re opening out this giant treasure house of human history,
    going back to our migration from Africa.”'

    for which written documentation is scarce. Much of what we know about life in
    what scholars call the early medieval period, for example – the period once widely
    known as the dark ages – comes from monastic chronicles and saints’ lives. These
    sources supply plenty of information about religious observance, but have much
    less to say about the origin of kingdoms, say, or the growth of trade.

    the fall of the western Roman empire, the European economy went into a tailspin.
    There was no stock ticker or economic index to track the scope or timing of the
    crash, but historians have been able to recover a bird’s eye view of what was
    happening by looking at evidence preserved in ice. Ice cores taken from Swiss
    and Greenlandic glaciers preserve a chronological record of the composition of
    the atmosphere, stacked year over year. Levels of lead in these cores correlate
    to the amount of silver that was being mined at any given moment. When atmospheric
    scientists measured the quantity of this ancient lead pollution in sections of
    the ice core dating to the first millennium AD, they found that [silver production
    crashed](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1721818115) in the third century
    – earlier than expected and well before the end of Roman power – and didn’t pick
    up for 400 years, when the Merovingians [re-opened major silver mines](https://history.fas.harvard.edu/files/loveluck_cp_et_al_2018_advance_view_alpine_icecore_european_monetary_system_ad_640-670.pdf)

    races. Emperors ruled less as Caesars than as fire-and-brimstone preachers, promising

    the bustling cities of the Mediterranean, which had been assumed to be the plague’s
    natural home. Since then, it has been identified in sixth-century remains in France,
    Spain and the UK. Analysis of bodies buried in a medieval cemetery in rural Cambridgeshire
    revealed that 40% of the people interred there had died suffering from the bubonic
    plague. Cumulatively, these discoveries suggest that the Justinianic plague was
    far more widespread than written sources had indicated, reaching beyond the remaining
    borders of the Roman empire to afflict such barbarian backwaters as Bavaria and
    Cambridge. The low amount of variation among the sixth-century samples indicates

    Gigantic volcanic eruptions pump huge quantities of gas into the upper atmosphere,
    where they can trigger episodes of global cooling by bouncing solar energy back
    into space. The ice core data suggested to climate scientists that a series of
    huge volcanic eruptions must have depressed global temperatures sometime in the
    mid-sixth century. But there was a problem: the dates didn’t line up. The ice

    from the lush, moss-strewn forests of Yakushima Island. Miyake found that the

    solar storms that struck the Earth in those years. Any organic material alive
    at the time of one of these storms carries a telltale chemical signature. These

    of military defeats and was ultimately dismantled by Tang China, its neighbour
    to the south. A century and a half later, the Uyghur empire, which occupied roughly
    the same area as the Eastern Turks, confronted what should have been a crippling,
    multi-decade drought. But instead of imploding, it thrived, in large part by establishing
    a military alliance and maintaining valuable trade links with the same Tang dynasty.

    by political and economic decisions, rather than by the raw facts of climate.
    But changes in foreign policy and the direction of international commerce don’t
    show up in tree rings. Historical work rooted in ancient genes faces a parallel
    problem. It generates tremendous amounts of information, but this comes shorn
    of the kind of rich context that only more traditional humanistic methods can
    supply.

    and catastrophes. For Michael McCormick, the real impact of new “molecular history”
    is its ability to “open windows on lives of people without voices”. Women, disabled
    people and the enslaved are all present in written sources, but usually only in
    “tiny numbers”, and seen through another’s eyes. However, in cemeteries, all these
    people are present, and in great numbers.
