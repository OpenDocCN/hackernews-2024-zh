    nomads, who lived in the grasslands of what is now southern Ukraine, enjoyed a
    truly ferocious reputation. According to the Greek historian Herodotus, the Scythians
    drank the blood of their fallen enemies, took their heads back to their king and
    made trinkets out of their scalps. Sometimes, they draped whole human skins over
    their horses and used smaller pieces of human leather to make the quivers that
    held the deadly arrows for which they were famous.

    more outlandish tales, gathered from all corners of the ancient world. (Not for
    nothing was the “father of history” also known as the “father of lies” in antiquity.)
    Recently, though, evidence has come to light that vindicates his account. In 2023,
    a team of scientists at the University of Copenhagen, led by [Luise Ørsted Brandt](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0294129),
    tested the composition of leather goods, including several quivers, recovered
    from Scythian tombs in Ukraine. By using a form of mass spectrometry, which let
    them read the “molecular barcode” of biological samples, the team found that while
    most of the Scythian leather came from sheep, goats, cows and horses, two of the
    quivers contained pieces of human skin. “Herodotus’s texts are sometimes questioned
    for their historical content, and some of the things he writes seem to be a little
    mythological, but in this case we could prove that he was right,” Brandt told
    me recently.

    researchers also points to something else about the future of history as a discipline.
    In its core techniques, history writing hasn’t changed that much since classical
    times. As a historian, you can do what Herodotus did – travel around talking to
    interesting people and gathering their recollections of events (though we now
    sometimes call this journalism). Or you can do what most of the historians that
    followed him did, which is to compile documents written in the past and about
    the past, and then try to make their different accounts and interpretations square
    up. That’s certainly the way I was trained in graduate school in the 2000s. We
    read primary texts written in the periods we studied, and works by later historians,
    and then tried to fit an argument based on those documents into a conversation
    conducted by those historians.

    and criticising arguments, you could write history directly from the physical
    remains of the past, reconstructing events with the forensic detail of a crime
    scene investigator? This would be a history written not from words, but from things.
    [Archaeology](https://www.theguardian.com/science/archaeology), art history and
    other disciplines rooted in the close study of material culture have long held
    out this promise. But traditionally there has been a dividing line between what
    they could offer and what was seen by many historians as their true task. These
    fields tended to move on different scales, and paid attention to different subjects.
    Historians, examining archival documents, written annals and inscriptions, focused
    more on named individuals in specific moments. Archaeologists and their brethren,
    examining changing styles of architecture, burials, fragments of ceramics and
    so on, gathered plenty of information, but on a broader scale. In a few places,
    such as the study of coins and seals, the two methods overlap. But generally speaking,
    these two approaches to the past – text-based and thing-based – have been assigned
    in different domains. Recently though, this division has become blurrier.

    remains has grown exponentially. In some cases, such as the study of ancient climates,
    old techniques have been employed with new scope and precision. In others, procedures
    such as whole-genome DNA sequencing – once expensive and error-prone when applied
    to ancient samples – have become reliable and ubiquitous. We also have brand new
    methods of dating, imaging and chemical analysis, which have allowed the detritus

    to see past events in human terms, with the great drivers of history coming from
    changes in culture and society. Natural scientists tend to focus on fluctuations
    in the natural world, often ascribing the fall of empires and kingdoms to factors
    such as prolonged droughts and outbreaks of plague. Some historians, like the
    Byzantinists Merle Eisenberg and John Haldon, caution against “overhasty assumptions”
    concerning the relationship of society and environment, and warn of “exaggerated

    a “scientific revolution”, which is still in its infancy. Speaking with audible

    be supplemented with comparable attention to material evidence. “Once you have
    physical pieces of the past in your hands, then the entire toolkit of the scientific
    revolution can be applied to it,” he said. “If you have leather, you can look
    at what the cow drank. If you have lumber, you can see what forest it grew in.

    the fall of the western Roman empire, the European economy went into a tailspin.
    There was no stock ticker or economic index to track the scope or timing of the
    crash, but historians have been able to recover a bird’s eye view of what was

    was dreadfully cold, as were those that followed. Five years later, an even worse
    calamity struck. In 541, reports of a terrible disease started arriving on the
    shores of the Mediterranean. It was said to have arrived in Egypt from some distant

    as one of the major turning points in world history. For Mischa Meier, a professor

    pestis*, or the bacterium responsible for the bubonic plague. But without genetic
    evidence, there was no way to know for sure. Then, in 2014, palaeogeneticists
    finally identified the first clear signature of the bubonic plague dating to the
    sixth century. It came from an unexpected source – southern Germany, far from
    the bustling cities of the Mediterranean, which had been assumed to be the plague’s
    natural home. Since then, it has been identified in sixth-century remains in France,
    Spain and the UK. Analysis of bodies buried in a medieval cemetery in rural Cambridgeshire
    revealed that 40% of the people interred there had died suffering from the bubonic
    plague. Cumulatively, these discoveries suggest that the Justinianic plague was
    far more widespread than written sources had indicated, reaching beyond the remaining
    borders of the Roman empire to afflict such barbarian backwaters as Bavaria and
    Cambridge. The low amount of variation among the sixth-century samples indicates
    that it must have spread across the whole of Europe at lightning speed.

    to peer inside Arctic glaciers. When palaeoclimatologists examined ice cores dating
    to the sixth century, they noticed an unusually high concentration of sulphates
    in the years after the start of the [late antique little ice age](https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/nov/09/the-climate-has-changed-before-but-this-is-different-look-at-the-archeological-record).
    In the pre-industrial past, sulphur in the atmosphere had one main source: volcanoes.
    Gigantic volcanic eruptions pump huge quantities of gas into the upper atmosphere,
    where they can trigger episodes of global cooling by bouncing solar energy back
    into space. The ice core data suggested to climate scientists that a series of
    huge volcanic eruptions must have depressed global temperatures sometime in the
    mid-sixth century. But there was a problem: the dates didn’t line up. The ice
    cores indicated that the first eruption occurred in 529\. Why would global cooling
    only begin seven years after the eruption that caused it? The solution to this
    riddle came from an unlikely source.'

    behaviour has changed over time. To do this, she measured the concentrations of
    carbon-14 – also known as radiocarbon – found in individual rings of ancient cedars
    from the lush, moss-strewn forests of Yakushima Island. Miyake found that the
    amount of radiocarbon spiked in certain years, probably as the result of the massive
    solar storms that struck the Earth in those years. Any organic material alive
    at the time of one of these storms carries a telltale chemical signature. These
    carbon-14 spikes – now known as Miyake events – provide a way of tying objects
    from archaeological sites to individual years. Among other things, Miayke events
    have been used to establish that the Vikings arrived in Newfoundland [in 1021](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-58996186),
    two decades later than historians had previously thought.

    from the depths of glaciers in Greenland and Antarctica, scientists were able
    to solve the mystery of the seven-year gap. It became clear that there had been
    miscalculations in the previous ice-core data, throwing out the chronology. The
    new Miyake data corrected this, and the seven-year gap now vanished: there really
    *had* been an eruption in 536, which caused the strange, sun-blotting cloud of
    that year. And two subsequent eruptions, in 540, and 547, contributed further
    to the extreme cooling that characterised the entire decade.'

    It was a nightmarish picture: years of sunless summers and freezing winters, capped

    data to support this image of a world caught in mid-collapse. Excavations across

    the shocks of an unprecedented, deadly epidemic and simultaneous extreme volcanic
    weather event without collapsing. This had led some historians to doubt that the
    event marked anything like the “end of the ancient world”. To Lee Mordechai and
    Merle Eisenberg, historians at Hebrew University and Oklahoma State University,
    respectively, the Justinianic plague was no more than an “inconsequential pandemic”.

    the sixth-century crisis to a “murder mystery with no body”. There is a killer,
    there is a modus operandi, but the victim doesn’t die. Indeed, as Eisenberg pointed
    out, after the plague, Byzantium was largely “fine” for another “80 years”, until
    the Arab conquests devastated the empire and deprived it of much of its territory
    three generations later. “How can you plausibly connect something that happens
    in the 540s with the 630s?” Eisenberg asks. “That’s like saying the 2008 recession
    was caused by the 1918 flu.”

    on the other, is a recurring feature of the new age of interdisciplinary, lab-powered

    inside a web of human institutions and ideas. They gain meaning only insofar as
    people ascribe meaning to them. For generations of historians, myself included,

    Study in Princeton, observes that there is “no single model or paradigm” for how
    societies respond to climate catastrophes. The nomadic empires he studies were
    particularly vulnerable to changes in seasonal weather, as they depended on animal
    herds that could be easily wiped out by “protracted droughts and winter disasters”.

    be resilient in the face of calamity. Soon after the Eastern Turkic empire was
    hit by a string of extremely cold winters in the late 620s, it suffered a series
    of military defeats and was ultimately dismantled by Tang China, its neighbour
    to the south. A century and a half later, the Uyghur empire, which occupied roughly
    the same area as the Eastern Turks, confronted what should have been a crippling,
    multi-decade drought. But instead of imploding, it thrived, in large part by establishing
    a military alliance and maintaining valuable trade links with the same Tang dynasty.
