  zh: 背景是斯坦福大学硅谷的人机交互教授 Terry Winograd 在 1998 年邀请我讲解我的一些工作。在我的演讲结束后，Terry 邀请我参观他的实验室并见一些他的研究生。其中一位博士生是一个聪明的年轻人，名叫拉里·佩奇，他向我展示了他改进网络搜索结果相关性的项目。
- en: I was very impressed with the usability implications of the PageRank mechanism.
    I had been studying the usability of web search for years and was thoroughly unimpressed
    with the leading search engines, such as Excite, Infoseek, AltaVista, and Yahoo!
    They all competed more on cluttering up their homepages than on better ranking.
    As the web grew at an unprecedented pace in those years (paralleling the growth
    of AI now), billions of pages were added, making usability decline rapidly due
    to bad sorting of the search results.

  zh: 我对 PageRank 机制的可用性影响印象深刻。多年来，我一直在研究网络搜索的可用性，对于主要的搜索引擎，如 Excite、Infoseek、AltaVista
    和 Yahoo!，我对它们的排名并不满意。它们竞相在首页上添加内容，而不是改进排名。随着互联网在那些年迅猛增长（与现在人工智能的增长相似），数十亿个网页被添加，由于搜索结果的排序不良，可用性迅速下降。
- en: Later, I heard that Page and Sergei Brin were starting a search engine company
    to bring their invention to the masses, instead of being confined to an academic
    laboratory. I was so thrilled that I offered to invest in this startup, which
    was to become Google. To this very day, this is the only startup I have felt strongly
    enough about to invest in. Unfortunately for my finances, fledgling Google already
    had plenty of money from real venture capital investors, so they turned my investment
    offer down. But Larry Page said that even though they didn’t need money, they
    needed usability advice, and he invited me to join the company’s advisory board.

  zh: 后来，我听说佩奇和谢尔盖·布林正在成立一家搜索引擎公司，将他们的发明带给大众，而不是被局限在学术实验室中。我非常激动，于是主动提出要投资这个初创公司，这就是后来的谷歌。直到今天，这仍然是我唯一一次强烈想要投资的初创公司。不幸的是，对我的财务状况来说，刚起步的谷歌已经得到了大量来自真正的风险投资者的资金，所以他们拒绝了我的投资提议。但拉里·佩奇说，即使他们不需要钱，他们也需要可用性建议，并邀请我加入公司的咨询委员会。

    company’s revenue was only $220,000 for the entire year, they must have spent
    a high percentage of the year’s budget on that party, even though they only gave
    away cheap champagne glasses. (Real photo.)*'

- en: I served on Google’s advisory board until the company had grown big enough to
    have all the needed expertise in-house. One particularly fun memory from the early
    meetings at Google’s first offices in Palo Alto is that we had to meet around
    the ping-pong table because they didn’t have a proper conference room with a table
    big enough for the entire advisory board.

- en: In those days, I recommended Google to everybody who would listen. Nobody knew
    what that odd name represented, but it usually only took one search to convert
    people into regular users. It’s somewhat like recommending the paid versions of
    ChatGPT 4 Turbo or Perplexity AI these days. People who only know free AI are
    gobsmacked when they see the real deal.

- en: I have found it very useful when new UI technologies come around to compare
    them with past technologies. While the surface characteristics change, many basic
    usability concerns remain the same. This is definitely true for some of the most
    fundamental UX questions, such as who the users are and what they are trying to
    achieve. After all, that’s what we must design for.

  zh: 当新的 UI 技术出现时，我发现将它们与过去的技术进行比较非常有用。虽然表面特征会改变，但许多基本的可用性问题仍然存在。这对于一些最基本的用户体验问题来说绝对是真实的，比如用户是谁以及他们试图实现什么目标。毕竟，这是我们必须设计的内容。
- en: But even specific UI questions can often be informed by experience of past designs.
    For example, many early web user interfaces were heavily dominated by form-filling
    designs, where users would complete an entire page’s worth of fields before pressing
    the submit button and passing their data to the server. This interaction style
    was highly reminiscent of the IBM mainframe interactions I had studied a decade
    earlier.

  zh: 但是，即使是关于具体UI的问题也经常受到过去设计经验的启发。例如，许多早期的web用户界面受到表单填写设计的严重影响，用户在按下提交按钮并将数据传输给服务器之前要完成整个页面的字段。这种交互方式让我十年前研究过的IBM主机交互形式想起来了。

    change little or none from one decade to the next. Therefore, how we study people
