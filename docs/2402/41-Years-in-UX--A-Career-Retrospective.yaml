    video call to any of the other researchers at the click of a mouse. But it was

    rest on 3 pillars: simplified UI prototypes, scaled-back qualitative user testing
    (usually with around 5 users), and heuristic evaluation. This combination allows
    for fast iterative design. More importantly, the low cost of the methods supports
    a high number of iterations within the available budget and schedule. In 1994,

    I had been studying the usability of web search for years and was thoroughly unimpressed

    They all competed more on cluttering up their homepages than on better ranking.
    As the web grew at an unprecedented pace in those years (paralleling the growth

    to bad sorting of the search results.

    enough about to invest in. Unfortunately for my finances, fledgling Google already
    had plenty of money from real venture capital investors, so they turned my investment
