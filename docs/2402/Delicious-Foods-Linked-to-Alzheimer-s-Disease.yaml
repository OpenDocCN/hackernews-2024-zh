    a can of soda. Sure, it's absolute heaven. But would you belly up to the same
    spread if you knew eating these delicious things carried serious neurological
    health risks?

    to developing Alzheimer's Disease, according to a [new study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38189748/)
    published in the *Journal of Alzheimer's Disease*.

    studying the eating habits of 438 people. Of this cohort, 108 participants were
    diagnosed with Alzheimer's and the rest didn't have the condition.

    analysis using data from the Australian Imaging Biomarker and Lifestyle Study
    of Aging, according to a [statement about the research](https://bond.edu.au/news/favourite-aussie-foods-linked-to-alzheimers).
    Basically, they tracked what participants were eating to establish any links to
    developing Alzheimer's later on.

    and meat items." The foodstuff they regularly ingested included beef, meat pies,
    sausages, ham, hamburgers and pizza — basically a mall food court's worth of delicious
    grub.

    — and, intriguingly, drank wine at lower rates as well.

    can be attributed to an uncontrolled lifestyle from a younger age," said lead
    author and biostatistics doctoral student Tahera Ahmed in the statement. "Raising
    awareness among the youth about the benefits of consuming leafy greens, organic
    foods, or home-cooked meals is essential, as opposed to regularly indulging in
    junk or processed foods."'

    that shows that what we eat may impact whether we develop dementia or Alzheimer's
    later in life.

    increases [inflammation and oxidation](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7369138/)
    inside our bodies, leading to brains that don't function the way they should. Or
    there could be a different mechanism that isn't yet understood, since an explanation
    for Alzheimer's itself still eludes doctors. And researchers are also trying to
    see if the [makeup of our gut biome](https://www.nia.nih.gov/news/beyond-brain-gut-microbiome-and-alzheimers-disease) might
    influence the trajectory of our brain health.
