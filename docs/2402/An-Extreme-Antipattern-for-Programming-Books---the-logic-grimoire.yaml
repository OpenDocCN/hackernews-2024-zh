- en: An extreme antipattern for a programming book is “download the author’s idiosyncratic
    library code from some random URL and figure out how to load it on your system”.
    No, all code used in the book should be printed in the book itself, so the reader
    can type it in. The URLs always break. The libraries never load properly. A book
    should never depend on a URL. If you have a small idiosyncratic library, put it
    in an appendix. If you have a large idiosyncratic library, rewrite your code to
    be simpler

    books and those that avoid this bad pattern age well and can still be useful and
    interesting even decades later

    to the most extreme “don’t put any URLs in Books at all” position because URLs
    in actual practice are just that bad.
