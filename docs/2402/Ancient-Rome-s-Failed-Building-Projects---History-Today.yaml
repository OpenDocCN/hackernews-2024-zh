- en: Troubled construction projects are perennially in the news. When looking for
    historical parallels of grand and wasteful infrastructure schemes, journalists
    and political commentators often reach for absurdities and failures that were
    occasionally undertaken by 20th-century communist regimes. But go back further
    and we see that even those ancient civilisations commonly renowned for their ability
    in construction also funded ill-thought-out and unrealised building projects.
