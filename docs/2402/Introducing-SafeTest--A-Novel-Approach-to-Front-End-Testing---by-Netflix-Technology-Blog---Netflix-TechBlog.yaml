    with offerings from [Cypress](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/component-testing/overview)
    and [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-components). While these tools
    attempt to rectify the shortcomings of traditional integration testing methods,
    they have other limitations due to their architecture. They start a dev server
    with bootstrapping code to load the component and/or setup code you want, which
    limits their ability to handle complex enterprise applications that might have
    OAuth or a complex build pipeline. Moreover, updating TypeScript usage could break
    your tests until the Cypress/Playwright team updates their runner.

    main idea is to have a [snippet of code in our application bootstrapping stage
    that injects hooks to run our tests](https://www.npmjs.com/package/safetest#bootstrapping-your-application)
    (see the [How Safetest Works](https://www.npmjs.com/package/safetest#how-safetest-works)
    sections for more info on what this is doing). **Note that how this works has
    no measurable impact on the regular usage of your app since SafeTest leverages
    lazy loading to dynamically load the tests only when running the tests (in the
    README example, the tests aren’t in the production bundle at all).** Once that’s
    in place, we can use Playwright to run regular tests, thereby achieving the ideal
    browser control we want for our tests.
