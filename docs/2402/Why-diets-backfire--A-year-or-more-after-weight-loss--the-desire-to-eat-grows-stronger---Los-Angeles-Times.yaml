- en: In a nutshell, people who have shed a significant chunk of their weight are
    hungrier and have a stronger desire to eat for at least a year after transitioning
    from weight loss to weight-loss maintenance. And even when their hormones send
    loud satiety signals to the brain after a meal, they still don’t feel full.

    published Thursday in the American Journal of Physiology-Endocrinology and Metabolism,
    falls in line with a growing field of research that explores the body’s tenacious
    and multi-pronged response to weight loss.

    to reset its thermostat to burn fuel more efficiently, to economize in calorie-burning
    movements and to rev up the impulse to find and eat food.

    away during times of famine. But in societies where calorific foods are never
    in short supply, these adaptations have worked to the detriment of dieters.

    responses become harder to override. In recent years, researchers have found [evidence](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12605342)
    that obesity makes the brain more “deaf” to some of the gut’s satiety signals,
    and more keenly attuned to signals of hunger.

- en: To study the effects of weight loss in 35 severely obese subjects, Norwegian
    researchers helped them lose close to a tenth of their weight. They provided dietary
    advice, exercise coaching and psychotherapy during several three-week stays at
    a wooded retreat in eastern Norway. All the subjects had a [body-mass index](https://apps.who.int/bmi/index.jsp?introPage=intro_3.html)
    greater than 42 (a BMI over 30 is considered obese) at the outset of the study.

    conduct a series of tests. Before and for three hours after meals, they gauged
    subjects’ subjective feelings of hunger, fullness and desire to eat, and asked
    how much food they planned to consume. And they measured circulating levels of
    five separate hormones that regulate appetite to see how they responded to the
    prospect of a meal or a meal just eaten.

- en: In the short run — four weeks after their exercise-and-weight-loss regimens
    got underway — the subjects had lost an average of 3.5% of their body weight.
    Their levels of appetite-boosting hormones had risen rapidly — probably a response
    to their getting roughly 3½ hours of exercise per day while at the retreat.

    reported to researchers a significant increase in their hunger and desire to eat.
    And the sensations of fullness they reported after meals had plummeted.

- en: Two years after enrolling in the study — and a year into their weight-maintenance
    programs — the subjects had, on average, kept the weight from coming back. But
    they continued to report levels of hunger and desire to eat that were just as
    high or higher than at the end of Year One. And they reported feeling no more

- en: At both time points, their hormone levels continued to show increases in appetite-stimulating
    compounds, as well as those that would signal fullness. Though they lost the weight
    and — with the study’s unusual level of support — managed to keep it off, they

    not so much.
