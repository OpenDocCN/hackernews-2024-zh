- en: The earliest record of William Shakespeare’s father in Stratford-upon-Avon famously
    notes his fine in 1552 for making a “muckhill” on a street.

- en: Now the long-held assumption that John Shakespeare was a 16th-century fly-tipper
    has been overturned as a myth. Far from being punished, he was simply paying a
    waste disposal toll for detritus relating to his trade as a glover and tanner
    of leather.

    family’s wealth, has discovered that a fine had other interpretations then.

    the last 500 years. A fine was simply a charge, a rent or rates. There was absolutely
    no moral imputation to John Shakespeare’s fine at all. Stratford muckhills in
    his lifetime were a rentable resource, for which the town could collect taxes.”'

    the founder of psychoanalysis, Sigmund Freud, who “wrote about how ‘barbarous’
    John Shakespeare was – and it’s absolutely wrong”.

    trade. It included urine, which decayed into ammonia, to be used for softening
    and tanning leather hides, among other processes.

    with a lucrative and not uncommon source of borough rent and revenue.

- en: He was taken aback to discover that the town’s 16th-century inhabitants had
    a far more sophisticated approach to waste disposal than had been realised, with
    citizens paying a fee for the convenience of keeping a muckhill on their property.

    as dirty, he said there was evidence to change that image, showing that its citizens
    were environmentally aware.

    rivers of excrement going down them. It’s not just heaving buckets of you-know-what
    out of the window. This changes the way we look at Shakespearean England, based
    on how the society uses waste and how it’s moved around and what they do with
    it.”

    Avon constituted a network of interrelated waste-management technologies and practices
    upon which the borough relied in the mid-16th century.

    while residents were responsible for cleaning the area in front of their property.
    Muckhills were neatly piled outside houses and shops and their owners were expected
    to scatter their contents over their fields or otherwise dispose of them.

    [financial transactions](https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2015/sep/26/dodgy-dealings-william-shakespeare-father-wool)

    a failed trader was also a fable, that he was also a national-level wool dealer.

    scepticism before they had seen the evidence. “Nobody would believe it because
    it’s challenging some of the deep tropes that have been built up over the years

    into finely crafted leather goods such as decorative gloves, John Shakespeare
    – along with the town haberdashers, mercers, milliners, woollen drapers, felt-makers
    and tanners – would have needed ready access to urine for several stages of their
    finishing processes. [Shakespeare’s] muckhill … may have been a crucial urine
    collection site for the cluster of fabric and leather working tradesmen living
