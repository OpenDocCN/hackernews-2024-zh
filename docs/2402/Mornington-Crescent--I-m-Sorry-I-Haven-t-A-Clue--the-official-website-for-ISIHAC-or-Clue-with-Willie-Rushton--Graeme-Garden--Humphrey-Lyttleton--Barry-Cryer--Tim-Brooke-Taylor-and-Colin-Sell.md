Mornington Crescent is a complex strategy game (level H8) named after a London Underground station on the Charing Cross branch of the Northern Line, between Euston and Camden Town in Travelcard Zone 2\. Mornington Crescent station is situated at the southern end of Camden High Street, where it meets Hampstead Road and Eversholt Street.

Closed for many years, the station was reopened on 27 April 1998 by the regular cast of I’m Sorry I Haven’t a Clue and a memorial plaque to the late Willie Rushton was installed at the station in 2002.

The dual-branch nature of the Northern Line means that, on the Charing Cross branch, Mornington Crescent is between Camden Town and Euston, while the City branch (which also runs from Camden Town to Euston) runs via tunnels which take an entirely different route to the Charing Cross branch and which therefore do not pass through Mornington Crescent. This unique feature opens up almost endless variations of play in the long game. Grand Master players also take full advantage of the area’s transport links, namely the bus routes 24, 27, 29, 46, 88, 134, 168, 214, 253, 274, C2 and Night routes N5 N20, N28, N29, N253 and not of course forgetting N279.
