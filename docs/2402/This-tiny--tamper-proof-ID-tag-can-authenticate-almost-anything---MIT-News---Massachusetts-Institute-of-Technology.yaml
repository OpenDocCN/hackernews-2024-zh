- en: A few years ago, MIT researchers invented a [cryptographic ID tag](https://news.mit.edu/2020/cryptographic-tag-supply-chain-0220)
    that is several times smaller and significantly cheaper than the traditional radio
    frequency tags (RFIDs) that are often affixed to products to verify their authenticity.

- en: 'This tiny tag, which offers improved security over RFIDs, utilizes terahertz
    waves, which are smaller and have much higher frequencies than radio waves. But
    this terahertz tag shared a major security vulnerability with traditional RFIDs:
    A counterfeiter could peel the tag off a genuine item and reattach it to a fake,
    and the authentication system would be none the wiser.'

    terahertz waves to develop an antitampering ID tag that still offers the benefits
    of being tiny, cheap, and secure.

    object, and then use terahertz waves to detect the unique pattern those particles
    form on the item’s surface. Akin to a fingerprint, this random glue pattern is
    used to authenticate the item, explains Eunseok Lee, an electrical engineering
    and computer science (EECS) graduate student and lead author of a paper on the
    antitampering tag.

    I spread a bunch of mirror pieces onto a surface and then shine light on that,
    depending on the orientation, size, and location of those mirrors, I would get
    a different reflected pattern. But if you peel the chip off and reattach it, you
    destroy that pattern,” adds Ruonan Han, an associate professor in EECS, who leads
    the Terahertz Integrated Electronics Group in the Research Laboratory of Electronics.

    millimeters in size. They also demonstrated a machine-learning model that helps
    detect tampering by identifying similar glue pattern fingerprints with more than
    99 percent accuracy.

    a massive supply chain. And its tiny size enables the tag to attach to items too
    small for traditional RFIDs, such as certain medical devices.

    Group of Anantha P. Chandrakasan, MIT’s chief innovation and strategy officer,
    dean of the MIT School of Engineering, and the Vannevar Bush Professor of EECS.
    Co-authors include EECS graduate students Xibi Chen, Maitryi Ashok, and Jaeyeon

    stuck an RFID tag onto his windshield to authenticate his car wash membership.
    For added security, the tag was made from fragile paper so it would be destroyed
    if a less-than-honest customer tried to peel it off and stick it on a different
    windshield.

    someone could use a solution to dissolve the glue and safely remove the fragile
    tag.

    the item itself, Han says. To achieve this, the researchers targeted the glue
    at the interface between the tag and the item’s surface.

    waves to pass through the tag and strike microscopic metal particles that have
    been mixed into the glue.

- en: Terahertz waves are small enough to detect the particles, whereas larger radio
    waves would not have enough sensitivity to see them. Also, using terahertz waves
    with a 1-millimeter wavelength allowed the researchers to make a chip that does
    not need a larger, off-chip antenna.

- en: After passing through the tag and striking the object’s surface, terahertz waves
    are reflected, or backscattered, to a receiver for authentication. How those waves
    are backscattered depends on the distribution of metal particles that reflect
    them.

    points on the object’s surface, capturing more information on the random distribution
    of particles.

    is destroyed by a counterfeiter,” Han says.

    stuck onto an item, and then store those data in the cloud, using them later for

    It was very difficult and time-consuming to take precise enough measurements to
    determine whether two glue patterns are a match.'

    Laboratory (CSAIL) and together they tackled the problem using AI. They trained
    a machine-learning model that could compare glue patterns and calculate their
    similarity with more than 99 percent accuracy.

    we could improve the neural network in the future if a large number of these tags
    were deployed in a supply chain, giving us a lot more data samples,” Lee says.

- en: The authentication system is also limited by the fact that terahertz waves suffer
    from high levels of loss during transmission, so the sensor can only be about
    4 centimeters from the tag to get an accurate reading. This distance wouldn’t
    be an issue for an application like barcode scanning, but it would be too short
    for some potential uses, such as in an automated highway toll booth. Also, the
    angle between the sensor and tag needs to be less than 10 degrees or the terahertz
    signal will degrade too much.

    researchers to be more optimistic about what can be accomplished with terahertz
    waves, despite the many technical challenges, says Han.

    spectrum can go well beyond broadband wireless. In this case, you can use terahertz
    for ID, security, and authentication. There are a lot of possibilities out there,”
    he adds.
