    many attempts to get a bootable image. Turned out that my image was one of first
    properly booting on a SL-5500 device. So I got write access to OpenEmbedded with
    “now you can merge all of it” message.

    as a user, went through being developer and [ended as a release manager](/2006/03/18/openzaurus-354-released/).
    Through those years I moved from my SL-5500 to the c760 (donated by user). Had
    several other Zaurus models on my desk in meantime.

    how packaging works, all those differences between build-time and install-time
    dependencies, sorting out upgrades etc. And how to cooperate with other developers
    and users. Also how to avoid those who deserve to be ignored.
