    inside. And I had no idea how it will end…

- en: At first it was a hobby. Finding what I can do with it (compared to previous
    devices running PalmOS) was fun. SharpROM, OpenZaurus 3.2, OpenZaurus 3.3-pre1
    etc. New apps, taskbar plugins…

    went for help. And got “forget this toolchain, we have a new toy: OpenEmbedded”.

- en: Took me some time to get familiar with that (lot of n00b questions asked). Then
    many attempts to get a bootable image. Turned out that my image was one of first
    properly booting on a SL-5500 device. So I got write access to OpenEmbedded with
    “now you can merge all of it” message.

- en: I spent three years working on OpenZaurus distribution. In my free time. Started
    as a user, went through being developer and [ended as a release manager](/2006/03/18/openzaurus-354-released/).
    Through those years I moved from my SL-5500 to the c760 (donated by user). Had
    several other Zaurus models on my desk in meantime.

- en: Those were interesting years. I learnt a lot about structure of Linux filesystem,
    how packaging works, all those differences between build-time and install-time
    dependencies, sorting out upgrades etc. And how to cooperate with other developers
    and users. Also how to avoid those who deserve to be ignored.

    on Poky Linux and its version of OpenEmbedded.

    development boards (those big ones with lot of interesting connectors for even
    more expensive equipment), prototypes of misc devices…

    with their Java based system on top of Poky Linux, Vernier with school palmtops
    and others. Still embedded Linux.

    My presentation was about supporting their developer board NHK-15 in Poky Linux

    asked and we signed papers.](/2010/04/06/another-job-change/) Then another papers
    and I became one of the first 20 people working at Linaro. To work on improving
    Arm support in Linux.
