    to say goodbye to their friends and families on their own terms and to celebrate
    their life while they are still alive. It’s not an entirely new concept. Living
    funerals started gaining popularity in Japan in the 1990s, where they’re known
    as *seizenso* (“funeral while living”), with the idea that it would take the pressure
    off family members or friends organising a funeral after someone had died. The
    practice has also taken off in South Korea. In 2019, 25,000 people took part in
    a mass living funeral to face their mortality and embrace living.

    so nothing remains left unsaid. “I think when you say these things out loud, it
    takes away an element of grief, because you’ve said everything you wanted to say.
