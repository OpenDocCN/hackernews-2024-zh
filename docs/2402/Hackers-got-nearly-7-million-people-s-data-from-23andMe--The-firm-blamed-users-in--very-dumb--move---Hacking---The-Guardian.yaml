- en: Three years ago, a man in Florida named JL decided, on a whim, to send a tube
    of his spit to the genetic testing site 23andMe in exchange for an ancestry report.
    JL, like millions of other 23andMe participants before him, says he was often
    asked about his ethnicity and craved a deeper insight into his identity. He said
    he was surprised by the diversity of his test results, which showed he had some
    Ashkenazi Jewish heritage.

    at the company that exposed the data of nearly 7 million people](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/dec/05/23andme-hack-data-breach),
    about half of the company’s customers. Worse, he later learned of a hacker going
    by the pseudonym “Golem” who had [offered to sell the names, addresses and genetic
    heritage](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/26/business/23andme-hack-data.html)
    reportedly belonging to 1 million 23andMe customers with similar Ashkenazi Jewish
    heritage on a shadowy dark web forum. Suddenly, JL worried his own flippant decision
    to catalog his genes could put him and his family at risk.

    hackers had actually been trying, sometimes successfully, to gain access since
    at least April 2023\. The attacks had continued for nearly five months through
    the end of September. In an email sent to the Guardian, a 23andMe spokesperson
