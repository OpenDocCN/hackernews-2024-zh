- en: Have you ever wondered why the extra day of the leap year falls on February
    29, an odd date in the middle of the year, and not at the end of the year on December
    32? There is a simple answer, and a slightly more complex one.

- en: Let’s start with the simple answer. Several ancient cultures (including early
    Christians) believed the world was created in the spring and therefore March was
    the beginning of the year. This means that when the Roman calendar added an extra
    day in February, they were in fact adding a day at the end of their year. So the
    simple answer is that we put the leap day at the end of February because the Romans
    did.

- en: 'Except that isn’t exactly true. The Romans did not add an extra day on February
    29, but on February 24, which is where the more complicated answer begins. The
    Romans kept a calendar by counting backwards from specific set times of the month,
    the *kalends* (March 1), the *nones* (March 7) and [the ides (March 15)](https://penelope.uchicago.edu/%7Egrout/encyclopaedia_romana/calendar/juliancalendar.html).
    Julius Caesar was famously told in Shakespeare’s play to: “Beware the ides of
    March,” also known as March 15, the day of his murder.'

- en: 'If the Romans started counting on the first day of March, which they called
    the kalends and moved backwards, then their days would progress retrospectively
    like this: the kalends is March 1, second kalends is February 28, third kalends
    is February 27 and so on until February 24 is the sixth kalends of March. On a
    leap day, they added a second sixth kalends of March, which they called the “bissextile
    day”, that is the second sixth day. In older writings of various kinds, you will
    still see people call the leap day, February 29, the bissextile day.'

    and was taught in monastic classrooms. Writing in the 11th century, the Anglo-Saxon
    scholar Byrhtferth of Ramsey [explained to his students](https://global.oup.com/academic/product/byrhtferths-enchiridion-9780197224168?lang=en&cc=hr):
    “[The bissextile day] is so called because *bis* is ‘twice’ and *sextus* is ‘sixth,’
    and because in that year we say ‘sixth kalends of March’ [February 24] today and
    the next day we say ‘sixth kalends of March’ [February 25] again.”'

- en: Byrhtferth’s students were monks and priests, and they needed to know about
    the leap day so that they could calculate religious feasts like Easter correctly.
    Easter is tricky to calculate because it is the first Sunday, after the first
    full moon, after the spring equinox (March 21 in medieval observance, March 20
    in modern reckoning).

    on the wrong day, and suddenly your parish is celebrating a whole host of religious
    observances from Ash Wednesday, to Lent, to Holy Week, to Pentecost on the wrong
    day.

    day was no small matter. [They believed](https://doi.org/10.7227/BJRL.89.2.7)

    east and west), positioned in such a way that they spell “Adam”, which refers
    to the first man, but also the human nature of Christ. Taken together, this diagram
    shows how elements on earth and heaven relate to each other and are held in balance
    with Christ at the centre and bound on the outside by time, which controls and
    orders the world.

    is about more than the proper observance of religious feasts – it is about honouring

- en: Byrhtferth’s monastic classroom also shows why the simple answer “because the
    Romans did it” isn’t adequate to explain why we still insert this leap day in
    February, nearly 1,600 years after the fall of Rome.

- en: At any point, the leap day could have been changed to something that made more
    sense in a modern calendar. However, the date needed to remain in February throughout
    the middle ages – and still does – so that the extra day is inserted before the
    spring equinox and Easter celebrations are kept on track.
