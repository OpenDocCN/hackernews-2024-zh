    Xiran Jay Zhao and Paul Weimer had been deemed ineligible as finalists despite
    earning enough votes according to information published last month by awards organizers.
    Emails released this week revealed that they were concerned about how some authors
    might be perceived in China, where the Hugo Awards were held last year for the
    first time.

    were held in October during the 81st World Science Fiction Convention, known as
    Worldcon, in the southwestern Chinese city of Chengdu. Scores of science fiction
    and fantasy writers had signed an [open letter](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MbHdM8rLG7tWhJgIam5oFfHHutDI5wHQ/edit)
    protesting the location, which was chosen by voting members of the convention,
    citing in an open letter allegations of abuses against Uyghurs and other mostly
    Muslim minority groups in China that Beijing denies.
