- en: An abandoned mine in Finland is set to be transformed into [a giant battery](https://www.independent.co.uk/tech/gravity-battery-mine-shaft-electricity-b2263572.html)
    to store [renewable energy](/topic/renewable-energy) during periods of excess
    production.

- en: The Pyhäsalmi Mine, roughly 450 kilometres north of Helsinki, is Europe’s deepest
    zinc and copper mine and holds the potential to store up to 2 MW of energy within
    its 1,400-metre-deep shafts.

- en: The disused mine will be fitted with a gravity battery, which uses excess energy
    from renewable sources like solar and wind in order to lift a heavy weight. During
    periods of low production, the weight is released and used to power a turbine
    as it drops.

- en: The gravity battery system has been developed by Scottish firm Gravitricity,
    which plans to use the Finnish mine as a full-scale prototype to demonstrate the
    technology.

- en: “This project will demonstrate at full scale how our technology can offer reliable
    long-life energy storage that can capture and store energy during periods of low
    demand and release it rapidly when required,” said Martin Wright, an executive
    chairman at Gravitricity.

    and allow our solution to be embedded into mine decommissioning activities, offering
    a potential future for mines approaching the end of their original service life.”

- en: A study last year by the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis
    (IIASA) estimated that gravity [batteries](/topic/batteries) in abandoned underground
    mines could store up to 70TWh of energy – enough to meet global electricity demands.

    that previously relied on the mine for their livelihoods.

    such an endeavour, while also being connected to the power grid.

    600 direct and indirect jobs were impacted. Other initiatives being explored for
    the site include a solar farm.

    sources, there is a growing need for technologies which can capture and store
    energy during periods of low demand and release it rapidly when required” Gravitricity’s
    website states.

    energy safely and deliver it on demand at a lower lifetime cost than current alternatives.”
