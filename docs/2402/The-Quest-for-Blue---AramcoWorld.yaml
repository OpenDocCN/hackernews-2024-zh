    in clear skies and bodies of water. Yet elsewhere blue appears infrequently, coloring
    only a handful of minerals and less than 10 percent of flowering plants. Even
    the feathers of birds, from blue jays to bluebirds, are not truly blue but the
    result of a biologically sophisticated trick of the eye. The scarcity of blue
    in the natural world has, for much of history, made it hard to reproduce.

    is indican, present in all members of the botanical genus *indigofera*. Woad contains
    far less of its own blue-producing precursor, thus requiring far greater amounts
    of the plant to process than Indian indigo.  The recipe for extracting the colorant
    from either species requires fermenting the leaves in an alkaline solution to
    chemically transform the precursor to a blue dye that reveals itself through oxidization,
    via repeated dunking of the dyed material. After each immersion, the material,
    which starts out yellow, becomes increasingly blue as it is exposed to air.

    in outdoor weathering and heat-buildup tests demonstrate that YInMn blue is superior
    to cobalt blue. In addition the high solar reflectance (compared to similarly

    of exterior applications by reducing surface temperatures, cooling costs and energy
    consumption.

    uses for indigo, based on its cooling properties, Balfour-Paul points out. Even
