    in clear skies and bodies of water. Yet elsewhere blue appears infrequently, coloring
    only a handful of minerals and less than 10 percent of flowering plants. Even
    the feathers of birds, from blue jays to bluebirds, are not truly blue but the
    result of a biologically sophisticated trick of the eye. The scarcity of blue
    in the natural world has, for much of history, made it hard to reproduce.

    by the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York—is among the finest examples of
    many faience animals that have been found in Egyptian tombs. (The smaller hippo

    2500 BCE. The Greeks named it *kyanos*, the root of the English word *cyan*. Traces

    BCE. To the Romans, it was *caeruleus* (in English, cerulean), meaning sky-blue,
    a favorite color for the villa walls of the well-to-do. It was a Roman who preserved
    the knowledge of how to make Egyptian blue: In his wide-ranging first-century-CE

    III deemed indigo in 1654\. In England Queen Elizabeth I decreed the dye poisonous
    and banned its use throughout the realm under threat of prison. The French government

    is indican, present in all members of the botanical genus *indigofera*. Woad contains
    far less of its own blue-producing precursor, thus requiring far greater amounts
    of the plant to process than Indian indigo.  The recipe for extracting the colorant
    from either species requires fermenting the leaves in an alkaline solution to
    chemically transform the precursor to a blue dye that reveals itself through oxidization,
    via repeated dunking of the dyed material. After each immersion, the material,
    which starts out yellow, becomes increasingly blue as it is exposed to air.

    to cobalt blue. In addition the high solar reflectance (compared to similarly
