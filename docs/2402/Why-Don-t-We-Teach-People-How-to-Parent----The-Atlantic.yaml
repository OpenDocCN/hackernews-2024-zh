    aunts, uncles, and grandparents might have all helped bring up a child. Many older
    kids had ample opportunities to help care for younger ones, too. The average family
    was bigger, so the typical kid would have more siblings and cousins—and may have
    also helped keep an eye on younger kids in the neighborhood. By the time you had

    baby or respond to a toddler’s tantrum and even done so yourself. You’d also likely

    children in a short amount of time, or all of the above. “For those multiply-stressed
    families, we tend to have some good resources,” Traube told me. “But the threshold
    to meet that’s pretty high.” The result is usually that the least wealthy families

    education might follow the same arc that mental health has in the zeitgeist: People
    used to seek help mostly in times of acute need. You were either someone who dealt
    with mental illness or someone who didn’t. But as therapy has become more normalized,

    A community in which parents feel less shame, Tominey told me, is ultimately going
