ACCEPTABLE

LASH SPLICE
SHIELD TERMINATION (TRADITIONAL)

The termionation is fully wetted, smooth and shiny. Conductor contours are discernable. Tubing is tightly shrunk with proper strain relief.

Best Workmanship Practice

ACCEPTABLE

SOLDER SLEEVE SPLICE
INLINE

The termination is fully wetted, smooth and shiny. Conductor contours are discernable. Tubing is tightly shrunk with proper strain relief, overlap and no exposed conductive surfaces.

ACCEPTABLE

SOLDER SLEEVE SPLICE
INLINE BRANCH

The termination is fully wetted, smooth and shiny. Conductor contours are discernable. Tubing is tightly shrunk, with proper strain relief, overlap and no exposed conductive surfaces.

ACCEPTABLE

SOLDER SLEEVE SPLICE
SHIELD TERMINATION (INLINE)

The termination is fully wetted, smooth and shiny. Conductor contours are discernable. Tubing is tightly shrunk, with proper strain relief, overlap and no exposed conductive surfaces.

ACCEPTABLE

WESTERN UNION/LINEMAN SPLICE

The termination is fully wetted, smooth and shiny. Tubing is tightly shrunk, with proper strain relief, overlap and no exposed conductive surfaces. Western Union splices are used for solid conductors.
