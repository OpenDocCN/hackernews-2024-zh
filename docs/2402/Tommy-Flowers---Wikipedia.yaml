    in telephone exchanges. By 1939, his design of equipment using 3000 to 4000 valves
    was in limited operation for (say) 1000 lines at an exchange with each line having
    three or four valves. Note that this was for (amplified) long distance or trunk
    lines between exchanges (central offices), using in-band signalling with switching
    at each end carried out by electromechanical switches or operators. As Flowers
    remarked, at the outbreak of war “he was possibly the only person in Britain who
    realised that valves could be used reliably on a large scale for high-speed computing.
    He was convinced that an all-electronic system was possible. A background in switching
    electronics would prove crucial for his computer designs.

    his director, W. Gordon Radley, was asked for help by [Alan Turing](/wiki/Alan_Turing
    "Alan Turing"), who was working at [Bletchley Park](/wiki/Bletchley_Park "Bletchley
    Park"), the government codebreaking establishment, 50 mi (80 km) north west of
    London in [Buckinghamshire](/wiki/Buckinghamshire "Buckinghamshire").^([[3]](#cite_note-3))
    Turing wanted Flowers to build a counter for the relay-based [Bombe](/wiki/Bombe
    "Bombe") machine, which Turing had developed to help [decrypt](/wiki/Decrypt "Decrypt")
    German [Enigma](/wiki/Enigma_machine "Enigma machine") codes.

    work, and in February 1943 introduced him to [Max Newman](/wiki/Max_Newman "Max
    Newman") who was leading the effort to automate part of the [cryptanalysis of
    the Lorenz cipher](/wiki/Cryptanalysis_of_the_Lorenz_cipher "Cryptanalysis of
    the Lorenz cipher"). This was a high-level German code generated by a teletypewriter
    in-line cipher machine, the [Lorenz SZ40/42](/wiki/Lorenz_cipher "Lorenz cipher"),
    one of their *Geheimschreiber* (secret writer) systems, called "Tunny" (tuna fish)
    by the British. It was a much more complex system than Enigma; the decoding procedure
    involved trying so many possibilities that it was impractical to do by hand. Flowers
    and Frank Morrell (also at Dollis Hill) designed the [Heath Robinson](/wiki/Heath_Robinson_(codebreaking_machine)
    "Heath Robinson (codebreaking machine)"), in an attempt to automate the cryptanalysis
    of the Lorenz SZ-40/42 cipher machine.^([[4]](#cite_note-autogenerated1-4))

    which his staff called Colossus, using perhaps 1,800 [thermionic valves](/wiki/Vacuum_tube
    "Vacuum tube") (vacuum tubes) instead of 150 and having only one paper tape instead
    of two (which required synchronisation) by generating the wheel patterns electronically.
    Because the most complicated previous electronic device had used about 150 valves,
    some were sceptical that the system would be reliable. Flowers countered that
    the British telephone system used thousands of valves and was reliable because
    the electronics were operated in a stable environment with the circuitry on all
    the time. The Bletchley management were not convinced and merely encouraged Flowers
    to proceed on his own.^([[5]](#cite_note-5)) He did so at the Post Office Research
    Labs, using some of his own funds to build it. ^([[6]](#cite_note-6))^([[7]](#cite_note-7))
    Flowers had first met (and got on with) Turing in 1939 but was treated with disdain
    by [Gordon Welchman](/wiki/Gordon_Welchman "Gordon Welchman"), because of his
    advocacy of valves rather than relays. Welchman preferred the views of Wynn-Williams
    and Keene of the [British Tabulating Machine Company](/wiki/British_Tabulating_Machine_Company
    "British Tabulating Machine Company") (BTM) who had designed and constructed the
    [Bombe](/wiki/Bombe "Bombe") and wanted Radley and "Mr Flowers of Dollis Hill"
    removed from work on Colossus for "squandering good valves".^([[8]](#cite_note-8))

    at Dollis Hill, W. G. Radley. With the highest priority for acquisition of parts,
    Flowers's team at Dollis Hill built the first machine in eleven months. It was
    immediately dubbed 'Colossus' by the Bletchley Park staff for its immense proportions.
    The Mark 1 Colossus operated five times faster and was more flexible than the
    previous system, named [Heath Robinson](/wiki/Heath_Robinson_(codebreaking_machine)
    "Heath Robinson (codebreaking machine)"), which used electro-mechanical switches.
    The first Mark 1, with 1500 valves, ran at Dollis Hill in November 1943; it was
    delivered to Bletchley Park in January 1944 where it was assembled and began operation
    in early February.^([[11]](#cite_note-autogenerated2-11)) The algorithms used

    a crucial meeting between [Dwight D. Eisenhower](/wiki/Dwight_D._Eisenhower "Dwight

    Eisenhower a note summarising a Colossus decrypt. This confirmed that [Adolf Hitler](/wiki/Adolf_Hitler
