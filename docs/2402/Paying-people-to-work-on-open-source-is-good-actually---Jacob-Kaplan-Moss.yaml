    lot of “right on"s, which was nice.) I think some of that pushback was bad-faith
    and uncharitable reads, but some was coming from well-intentioned misunderstandings
    or misreadings of my snarky toot. That’s my fault for talking around what I mean
    instead of coming out and saying it. So that’s this post: upgrading my shitpost

    full stop, no exceptions. **We need to stop criticizing maintainers getting paid,
    and start celebrating.** Yes, all of the mechanisms are flawed in some way, but
    that’s because *the world* is flawed, and it’s not the fault of the people taking
    money. Yelling at maintainers who’ve found a way to make a living is wrong.

    hyperbolic to say that open source is one of the most notable collective successes
    of humankind as a species! It’s one of the few places where essentially all of
    humanity works together on something that benefits everyone. A world without open
    source would be substantially worse than the world we live in.

    can read and modify and release variants of, perhaps under some conditions.” So
    I’m including OSI and FSF licenses, but also the [Polyform licenses](https://polyformproject.org/licenses/)

    meaning “only OSI-approved licenses” – or, worse, “the GPL is the only ’true’
    Free Software license” – is part of the problem here. I want to see more experimentation
    and variety in licensing options, and if that means introducing some additional
    restrictions beyond “anyone can use this for any purpose” I’m pretty okay with
    that. In my book, a broad spectrum of licenses from [Blue Oak](https://blueoakcouncil.org/license/1.0.0)
    to [BSL](https://mariadb.com/bsl-faq-mariadb/) (and even more restrictive than
    BSL) “count” as open source.

    be considered free. I’ll even use the terms “open source” and “free software”
    interchangeably just to hammer home how, in this context, the precise definitions
    of these terms don’t matter to me.

    their basic needs met – housing, food, healthcare, etc. Ideally, more than that;

    It’s true that VC investment comes with strings attached that often lead to problems

    against the [Freedom 0](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Free_Software_Definition)
