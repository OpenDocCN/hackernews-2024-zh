The horror of it dawned on Dmitry Rybolovlev in paradise, of all places. Over lunch in St Barts in 2014, conversation turned to a painting by Amedeo Modigliani, an Italian artist, that the Russian billionaire had bought several years before in a private sale. At the table happened to be an art adviser for the previous owner, who revealed Mr Rybolovlev paid around $25m more than what the seller had made.

It turned out that a Swiss middleman named Yves Bouvier, whom Mr Rybolovlev thought was acting as his adviser, pocketed the difference, plus an agreed-upon commission. The staggering markup fit a pattern. Over 38 sales Mr Bouvier allegedly made more than $1bn. On many occasions Mr Rybolovlev says he was told falsely that Mr Bouvier was haggling with the sellers to get better prices, only to inflate them.
