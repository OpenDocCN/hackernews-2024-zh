- en: Much has been hypothesized and feared about 51% attacks on Bitcoin and 34% attacks
    on Ethereum. However, the costs and benefits associated with perpetrating these
    attacks remain a mystery. In this paper, we present a novel model to quantify
    the costs to breach Byzantine fault tolerance thresholds in Bitcoin and Ethereum.
    We introduce a new metric called Total Cost to Attack (TCA) which encompasses
    the operational and capital expenditures associated with these attacks. We explore
    the motivations and expected utility of both profit-driven and ideologically-motivated
    actors. Our findings suggest that the current state of security in Bitcoin and
    Ethereum make attacks economically unfeasible and provide empirical evidence of
    Nash Equilibrium in these networks. This study also challenges the notion that
    there is a linear relationship between fee revenue and network security, an assumption
    frequently made when discussing Bitcoin’s declining subsidies. Instead, our findings
    suggest that block producers engage in speculative behavior ahead of fee cycles,
    which ends up increasing network security even when fees are low and trending
    downwards. Our analysis contributes to the discourse around the long term viability
    of deflationary monetary policies used by Bitcoin and Ethereum and their impact
    on miner incentives and network security.
