    by [DB-Engines Ranking](https://db-engines.com/en/blog_post/106) and is used more

    since 2011, which allow storing data changes over time rather than just the current
    data state. However, relational databases don’t completely follow the standards.
    In the case of PostgreSQL, it doesn’t support these features, even though there
    has been a submitted [patch](https://www.postgresql.org/message-id/flat/CALAY4q-cXCD0r4OybD%3Dw7Hr7F026ZUY6%3DLMsVPUe6yw_PJpTKQ%40mail.gmail.com)

    on row changes with `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE` queries. The official PostgreSQL
    wiki describes a generic [audit trigger function](https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Audit_trigger).
    Let’s have a quick look at a simplified example.

    of TEXT, ignoring changes in certain columns, pausing auditing a table, and so

    repo and its forks.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Another alternative is the [temporal_tables](https://github.com/nearform/temporal_tables)
    implementation written by using triggers. The main difference is that it stores
    records in a separate table with a time range during which a version was valid,
    not just an initial timestamp when a change was recorded. This makes it easier
    to perform time travel queries by selecting records that were valid at a specific
    point in time.
