    – must by now be well conditioned to accept that the software they run and the
    data they believe they own isn’t really something they control.

    tabs open in Google Chrome – even when Microsoft browser’s import tool is disabled
    – has been known for months, without getting fixed (assuming it was a bug).

    a software one. It’s definitely a feature, after all.

    the “operation” easier; and Microsoft and Google are birds of a feather when it
    comes to invasive and controversial practices and behavior toward end-users.

    either. Some reports suggest that this “tab-stealing” feature is in fact “just”
    Microsoft’s way of trying to steal users from Chrome and get them to, willy-nilly,
    switch to Edge.

    and a Windows and Chrome (and occasionally Edge) user described the ordeal, the
    gist of which is that the tabs left open in their default Chrome browser got imported
    to Edge after a Windows update and a reboot.

    the Windows/Edge experience summed up in one sentence: “I didn’t even realize
    I was using Edge at first, and I was confused why all my (imported from Chrome)
    tabs were suddenly logged out.”'

    assimilation of open Chrome tabs by Edge.
