    for non-French readers, is quantity, and therefore the marathon-like endurance
    of anyone who actually reads all seven volumes of *In Search of Lost Time*, and
    can prove it. A 2016 cartoon in the *New Yorker* features a middle-aged couple
    sitting up in bed when one of them realises he and his partner are exactly the
    age at which they must start the opus if they hope to finish it before death.
    In a classic Looney Tunes episode Bugs Bunny has sent Elmer Fudd into a dustcloud
    of St. Vitus-like commotion from which he cannot escape; the sheer temporal extension
    of Fudd’s state is marked by Bugs sitting down next to him and patiently opening
    the cover of *Remembrance of Things Past* (as it used to be called in English).

    it on amounts to a form of world-renunciation, and potentially an abnegation of
    our “real” moral connections and political duties. I recall shortly after September
    11, 2001, Christopher Hitchens wrote that he had recently been on the cusp of
    giving up on politics altogether and devoting himself to a sustained critical
    work on the French novelist, only to be awoken and drawn back into the world by
    “Islamofascism”, and to the calling of militant atheism that would occupy him
    for the rest of his life. I don’t believe Hitchens was telling the truth about
    this —I don’t believe he had an extended analysis of Proust inside him and ready
    to go, if only real-world events hadn’t gotten in the way—, but in any case it
    casts Proust again into a peculiar role, one that is not so different from the
    self-help use-value that authors like Alain de Botton in his consistently banal
    *How Proust Can Change Your Life* (1997) promise he will deliver: Proust as a
    private indulgence and a retreat from engagement.'

    led me to find nothing so worthy of my attention as Proust. There are many reasons
    for this, some entirely personal, others defensible within a shared space of reason.
    In part it is that it’s in my nature to take on formidable things; I’ve always
    liked big books *because* they’re big. In part I feel a growing sense of rhyme
    between my own life and Proust’s; not that I’ve accomplished anything like what
    he was able to do in his fifty-one years, but only that I, too, have entered what
    I experience as my mostly supine, mostly bedridden phase of incurable graphomania,
    in which my “life” —the social events and the drinking and the traveling and the
    pursuit of day-to-day matters, as Czesɫaw Miɫosz put it, “under orders from the
    erotic imagination”— appears to me to be definitively over, even if I’ve set my
    noblesse-oblige on autopilot and still occasionally go through the motions learned
    in the old times. Proust’s writing bed, now lovingly relocated to the Carnavalet
    Museum for the history of Paris, touches me even more than the wisp of Marie Antoinette’s
    golden hair in a locket on display down the hall, as an emblem of my own condition.

    has been both an exploration of my own memories from the old days, and an extended
    reflection on what memories are, and what the faculty of memory is, in relation
    to the present. In both [straightforward essay form](https://justinehsmith.substack.com/p/the-panmnemonicon)

    I have pursued the idea of the “panmnemonicon”. This is a variation on Jeremy
    Bentham’s fantasy of the panopticon: a technology that enables us, or forces us,
    not only to see everything present, but to recall, or to have available for recall,
    everything past as well. I have suggested that search-engine technology is bringing
    this fantasy ever closer to such a reality. It seems to me also that we may look
    at such monumental results as Prousts’s of the tekhnē of prose-writing as it had
    developed by the early twentieth century to be themselves contributions to the
    development of panmnemonic technology, of a new human reality in which time cannot

    a time when my French reading comprehension really was not up to the task, and
    my experience of Proust’s language was dim like a child’s daydream. (I recommend
    reading novels in languages you don’t fully know yet, incidentally; it’s a different
    kind of aesthetic experience, but one worth having, and in the case of some novels,
    including Proust’s, it’s an experience that honors and reflects the phenomenology
    of the work itself.) I decided this summer to read all seven volumes in order,
    from start to finish, and to reflect on them, occasionally, here at The Hinternet.
    I’ve just now finished volume one, *Du côté de chez Swann*, and so am offering
    this first installment in what may turn out to be a series of seven essays on
    Proust… unless some world-historical event I cannot at present anticipate comes

    little traintrains perhaps not because we’ve ceased to value what is in fact the

    not just an oddity, but runs like a leitmotif throughout all of “Combray” (which

    of *Du côté de chez Swann*, while “Un amour de Swann”, the central and longest
    section, has the character somewhat more of a Balzacian social novel, about which
    more soon). The leitmotif tells us, I think, quite a bit about Proust’s standing
    as a “nature writer”. It may seem unfamiliar to characterise him in this way.
    There is a common prejudice, partially based in reality, that while English authors
    such as Shaftesbury with his mossy gardens, and German Romantics up to and including
    Heidegger with his Black Forest *Holzwege*, have long been sensitive to the independent
    and indomitable existence of the natural sublime, French authors have been strongly
    influenced by the old ambition, inscribed in the eighteenth-century into the rules
    for cutting the hedges at the Jardin des Plantes, of achieving “le contrôle total
    du monde végétal.” It does often seem in some French authors, and indeed at moments
    in “Un amour de Swann” for Proust too, that society is so captivating as to obscure
    nature from view, that “the world” is so seductive as to make one forget about

    gaze of the nineteenth-century social novelists wait in vain for an expression

    any affirmation of the natural justice on which the unequal aristocratic order
    is based. Ideologues have, as we’ll see, taken this ambiguity as itself reactionary;

    the literary theorist and scholar of Tlingit Matthew Spellberg has observed that
    the few centuries in which we took dreams to be the “unreal” part of our daily
    cycle, and wakefulness to be the “real” part, may in the end turn out to be a
    historical aberration. Certainly, if we survey the different cultures of the world,
    it is a deviant thing to suppose that dreams are mere hallucinations, while, say,
    laboring in a factory is “the real stuff”. One of the most important services
    of modern literature, on this view, has been to preserve a role for the dream-life
    in a culture that in its philosophy and its etiquette (which may amount to the
    same thing) does everything it can to sweep dreaming under the rug.

    moment in which I was Manhattan, while the person with whom I shared a bed was
    Brooklyn. That’s strange enough, but at least there we were two good-sized physical
    masses, just as we ordinarily take ourselves to be in waking life. But a rivalry
    is a relation that obtains between two such masses, a consequence of their subjectivities
    in collision, and not a being itself. Yet think now of seeing a young couple in
    love, walking hand-in-hand. They awaken a bittersweet desire in you, but for what
    exactly? To be one of them? Which one? Both? Or perhaps the desire is not to be
    either one of them at all, but to be the relation between them, to be the union
    of their surfaces or the contact of their souls. In fact subjective experience,
    perhaps especially experience fueled by desire, seems very often to insinuate
    itself between people in this way, and make its home there. Proust then lays bare
    here something we ordinarily don’t notice about subjective consciousness as such,
    and does so by taking dreaming as the most exemplary state of it, rather than
    an embarassing aberration, a nightly lapse into florid psychosis.

    will be dreaming soon too.” My hands do not themselves have brains, of course,
    or rather, their brains just are my brain. And yet, in that twilight phase they
    somehow become proper others, with subjectivities of their own, yet to which I
    also have complete and immediate access.'

    of our hands, the colours and smells of asparagus. At least, that’s how things
    seem, in a certain state of consciousness, and it’s a worthy aim of literature
    to take this state of consciousness as reality, and to account for it.

    rather the flow of these qualities in time, that Proust is intent on capturing.
    The thematisation of subjective time, of time as memory, is of course what makes
    Proust particularly interesting as a literary echo of the preoccupations of his
    contemporaries in philosophy, or at least the currents of philosophy that were
    emergent on the European continent in his lifetime. In the Anglo-American tradition,
    by contrast, Proust will continue to be invoked mostly as a Looney Tunes-style
    punchline, if he is known at all. I still remember a day in 1996 when a fellow
    Columbia graduate student, citing an example I believe from J. L. Austin in which
    Proust is mentioned, pronounced the name in question in a way that rhymes with
    *joust*. Shortly after that I went out and bought Deleuze’s *Proust and Signs*,
    which I never understood, but which in the English edition had beautiful multicoloured
    eggs pictured on the cover.

    event as this one from sixty years prior, and in some sense you could eternalise
    that blubbering boy’s small triumph in textual form, and that it is good and worthy
    to do this, is something my dad only thought to encourage because the template

    a sort of past is indeed called up, but it differs from what we think of as the
    past in that it is, first of all, a collective past, and second of all, a past
    that plays out in a “mythical” realm where the laws of reality are not the same,
    and people, generally conceived as ancestors, are heroes or gods.

    a fleur-de-lys in their hands, the scenes of weddings and funerals, were represented
    as they might have been in the soul of Françoise. The sculptor had also related
    certain anecdotes pertaining to Aristotle and to Virgil, in the same way that
    Françoise might have freely spoken in the kitchen of Saint Louis as someone she
    had personally known… One sensed that the notions that the medieval artist and
    the medieval peasant-woman (surviving into the nineteenth century) had of ancient
    and Christian history, which were marked as much by imprecision as by familiarity,
    were drawn not from books, but from a tradition that was ancient and direct at
    once, uninterrupted, oral, deformed, unrecognisable and alive.

    person can be a living embodiment, a traduction of archaic national history, and
    that this history is not betrayed but on the contrary kept alive by its quality
    of imprecision, is at the same time a bulwark against the sense that the past
    is something that recedes inescapably and regrettably from us as it transforms
    into bittersweet memory. This is an idea that Proust’s own work is in the course
    of shattering, even as he was memorialising it through the character of Françoise.

    a draft of what I have called “the panmnemonicon”, where, ideally, all of it,
    everything it was ever like to have lived a singular human life, is available
    for recall. To some extent such an ideal has always been available through the
    figure of divine omniscience. A medieval nun bathing with a wooden plank over
    the surface of the tub so that God would not see her? That’s an idea ancestral
    to the panopticon, or the fear of it. The list of all your sins that St. Peter
    has waiting for you on your arrival at the Gates of Heaven? That is an anticipation
    of the panmnemonicon.

    it for example in the birthing of a woman from his thigh (Aunt Léonie, by contrast,
    is too weighted with the legacy of sin to even acknowledge in language that she
    ever sleeps, as sleep implies dreaming and dreaming implies sensual fantasy).
    Yet the project of literary total recall may be seen as something like an attempt
    to beat God to the chase, and come up with the list on one’s own before dying.
    Of course unlike God’s list our list will always remain incomplete; we are finite
    beings after all. But this is perhaps where the distance of literary autofiction,
    as opposed to the straight autobiographical enumeration of singular events, also
    helps through style, through beauty, to convey the appearance of completeness.

    already accomplished miraculous feats in the technology of retrieval of the singular
    past. *À la recherche du temps perdu* is notable among them.
