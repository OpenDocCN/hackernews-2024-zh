- en: Over the past few weeks, I have been scanning my notes and homework from school
    using the nice professional scanners at my workplace. These notes have been sitting
    in my closet for several years because I don't want to keep them, but didn't want
    to throw them out until scanning them, and I've never had access to a scanner
    that could do all these pages.

    handwriting to "I'm running out of space" small handwriting at the bottom of the
    page is shameful. Two pages with healthy margins and spacing is better than one
    page of cramming.

    paper for my work notes. This time, instead of using store-bought graph paper,
    I'm just printing my own. I created an [svg file](https://voussoir.net/writing/notes_on_paper/graphpaper_025_grid_240.svg)
    with a half-inch margin and a whisper-faint quarter-inch grid. This is working

    [20lb or 75gsm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammage). Try something heavier
    like 28lb/105gsm or 32lb/120gsm. Heavier paper costs more, but it feels more pleasant
    to write on. If you enjoy it more, you'll do it more.
