- en: Over the past few weeks, I have been scanning my notes and homework from school
    using the nice professional scanners at my workplace. These notes have been sitting
    in my closet for several years because I don't want to keep them, but didn't want
    to throw them out until scanning them, and I've never had access to a scanner
    that could do all these pages.

    in my handwritten notes. I realize there are entire online cultures of journaling
    and notetaking and notebook-buying, and I'm not here to compete with them. This
    is just what I do.

    your notes stack well with printed material. A lot of lined/punched notebook paper
    is [smaller](https://voussoir.net/writing/notes_on_paper/2018-03-05.png) than
    printer paper.

    pens that produce deep black lines, not cheap pens that produce off-black or hollow
    lines.

    to do so. The dollar cost of the paper is less than the [inconvenience](https://voussoir.net/writing/notes_on_paper/2018-03-06.png)
    cost of double sided material.

- en: Resist the urge to cram everything onto one page. The telltale switch from big
    handwriting to "I'm running out of space" small handwriting at the bottom of the
    page is shameful. Two pages with healthy margins and spacing is better than one
    page of cramming.

- en: Consider using plain, blank printer paper. At work, I am currently using blank
    printer paper for notetaking, and my "manuscript" is up to about 140 sheets. I
    don't think I would recommend this for structured school lectures, but it's good
    for unstructured meetings.

- en: As a result of writing this article, I have decided to try going back to graph
    paper for my work notes. This time, instead of using store-bought graph paper,
    I'm just printing my own. I created an [svg file](https://voussoir.net/writing/notes_on_paper/graphpaper_025_grid_240.svg)
    with a half-inch margin and a whisper-faint quarter-inch grid. This is working
    out great and I wish I had done it sooner.

    paper will need time and/or weight to flatten back out.

    [20lb or 75gsm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammage). Try something heavier
    like 28lb/105gsm or 32lb/120gsm. Heavier paper costs more, but it feels more pleasant
    to write on. If you enjoy it more, you'll do it more.

    to support lossless full color, and I'd rather have the aliasing and dithering
    artifacts of lossless 1-bit than the jpeggy, blocky artifacts of lossy color.
    This is an aesthetic preference and I think dithering looks cool anyway.
