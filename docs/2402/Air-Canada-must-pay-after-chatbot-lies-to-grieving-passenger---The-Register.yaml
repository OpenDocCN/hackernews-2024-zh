    chatbot gave the guy wrong information before he booked a flight.

- en: Jake Moffatt took the airline to a small-claims tribunal after the biz refused
    to refund him for flights he booked from Vancouver to Toronto following the death
    of his grandmother in November last year. Before he bought the tickets, he researched
    Air Canada's bereavement fares – special low rates for those traveling due to
    the loss of an immediate family member – by querying its website chatbot.

- en: The virtual assistant told him that if he purchased a normal-price ticket he
    would have up to 90 days to claim back a bereavement discount. Following that
    advice, Moffatt booked a one-way CA$794.98 ticket to Toronto, presumably to attend
    the funeral or be with family, and later an CA$845.38 flight back to Vancouver.

    to get a bereavement discount on his flights and that he should expect to pay
    roughly $380 to get to Toronto and back. Crucially, the rep didn't say anything
    about being able to claim the discount as money back after purchasing a ticket.

    his grandmother's death certificate, all well within that 90-day window, Air Canada
    turned him down.

- en: Staff at the airline told him bereavement fare rates can't be claimed back after
    having already purchased flights, a policy at odds with what the support chatbot
    told Moffatt. It's understood the virtual assistant was automated, and not a person
    sat at a keyboard miles away.

    accurate," and that customers like Moffatt wouldn't have known why information

    ordered to pay Moffatt a total of CA$812.02, including CA$650.88 in damages.
