    chatbot gave the guy wrong information before he booked a flight.

- en: Jake Moffatt took the airline to a small-claims tribunal after the biz refused
    to refund him for flights he booked from Vancouver to Toronto following the death
    of his grandmother in November last year. Before he bought the tickets, he researched
    Air Canada's bereavement fares – special low rates for those traveling due to
    the loss of an immediate family member – by querying its website chatbot.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The virtual assistant told him that if he purchased a normal-price ticket he
    would have up to 90 days to claim back a bereavement discount. Following that
    advice, Moffatt booked a one-way CA$794.98 ticket to Toronto, presumably to attend
    the funeral or be with family, and later an CA$845.38 flight back to Vancouver.

- en: He also spoke to an Air Canada representative who confirmed he would be able
    to get a bereavement discount on his flights and that he should expect to pay
    roughly $380 to get to Toronto and back. Crucially, the rep didn't say anything
    about being able to claim the discount as money back after purchasing a ticket.

- en: When Moffatt later submitted his claim for a refund, and included a copy of
    his grandmother's death certificate, all well within that 90-day window, Air Canada
    turned him down.

- en: Staff at the airline told him bereavement fare rates can't be claimed back after
    having already purchased flights, a policy at odds with what the support chatbot
    told Moffatt. It's understood the virtual assistant was automated, and not a person
    sat at a keyboard miles away.

    took the airline to a tribunal, claiming the corporation was negligent and misrepresented
    information, leaving him out of pocket.

    outputs, without explaining why, which baffled tribunal member Christopher Rivers.

    of its agents, servants, or representatives – including a chatbot. It does not
    explain why it believes that is the case," he wrote in his [decision](https://decisions.civilresolutionbc.ca/crt/crtd/en/item/525448/index.do)

    is responsible for its own actions. While a chatbot has an interactive component,
    it is still just a part of Air Canada''s website. It should be obvious to Air
    Canada that it is responsible for all the information on its website. It makes
    no difference whether the information comes from a static page or a chatbot."'

    that refunds for discounted fares cannot be claimed retroactively, and Moffatt
    should have clicked on it. But Rivers didn't agree.

    accurate," and that customers like Moffatt wouldn't have known why information
    on Air Canada's webpage should be more correct than its chatbot. Air Canada was
    ordered to pay Moffatt a total of CA$812.02, including CA$650.88 in damages.

    regurgitate false information, so use them at your own risk – unless you're happy
    and able to extract damages, natch. ®
