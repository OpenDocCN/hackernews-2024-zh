    to make good on that promise, though I am already late for January… So let’s just
    say I want to write on average once a month. Just a small change of the goal posts.
    I think it is acceptable.

    your manager lacks some skills?

    to find people that are inspiring in the areas you need guidance and your manager
    lacks. Maybe you need someone more empathetic, or who is a better engineer to
    discuss and teach you. Whatever that is, those skills should be present around
    you, and connecting with them will help you be better!
