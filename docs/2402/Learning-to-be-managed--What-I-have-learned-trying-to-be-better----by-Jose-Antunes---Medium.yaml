    to make good on that promise, though I am already late for January… So let’s just
    say I want to write on average once a month. Just a small change of the goal posts.
    I think it is acceptable.

    That was my internal 2023 goal. It hurts to say it out loud and admit in public
    failing to achieve a goal, but self-awareness is the start of change.

    all these marks. And that is ok! So what should you do in this situation, when
    your manager lacks some skills?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The answer is simple, continue networking within your company (and even outside)
    to find people that are inspiring in the areas you need guidance and your manager
    lacks. Maybe you need someone more empathetic, or who is a better engineer to
    discuss and teach you. Whatever that is, those skills should be present around
    you, and connecting with them will help you be better!

    will remember everything you did every quarter (or however long your evaluation
    period is)! Does the question “What did I do these last 6 months?” ring a bell?
