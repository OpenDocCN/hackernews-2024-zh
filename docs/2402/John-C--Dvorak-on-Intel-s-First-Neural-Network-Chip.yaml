    chips dedicated to accelerating machine learning, with an initial post looking
    at the origins of Google’s first TPU.

    create dedicated neural network chips. Intel, amongst many others, got there first.
    Decades earlier, in fact.

- en: While everyone worries about the next hot processor chip, a small team of engineers
    at Intel invented the 80170, the world's fastest and most powerful neural network
    on a chip. In processing power, it is something of a breakthrough, having achieved
    the theoretical intelligence level of a cockroach - no kidding.

    a frightening amount of processing power and has the company baffled. “Nobody
    at Intel knows what to make of this thing," I was told.

    job (if one can be called a programmer) is to organize the data in such a way
    that it can be analyzed over and over until the network discovers patterns and
    extrapolates data from incomplete data sets. Predicting weather and determining
    which horse will win the third at Belmont are perfect neural net applications.

    A typical high end PC had an 80386 running at up to 20MHz and up to 16MB of memory.

    first commercial neural processors, introduced by Intel around 1989\. Implemented
    on a 1.0 µm process, this chip incorporated 64 analog neurons and 10,240 analog
    synapses. The ETANN is also the first commercial analog neural processor and is
    considered to be the first successful commercial neural network chip.'

    who invented the [Dvorak keyboard layout](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dvorak_keyboard_layout).
