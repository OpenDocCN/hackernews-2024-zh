    for $35 billion, which has to do with a loophole the Federal Reserve inserted
    into our banking laws. If it goes through, this merger will affect the relationship
    that millions of firms have to the payments system.

    In Minnesota, Judge Wilhelmina Wright just retired, and Senators Tina Smith and
    Amy Klobuchar have asked for potential candidates to replace her. Judges make
    laws around business real, so if you’re a Minnesota lawyer, consider applying.
    The application details are [here](https://www.klobuchar.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2024/1/klobuchar-smith-announce-judicial-selection-committee-for-vacancy-on-federal-district-court),

    banks. In 2022, I [wrote up](https://www.thebignewsletter.com/p/the-cantillon-effect-and-credit-cards)
    how the business works, with the observation that there’s something on the order
    of a quarter trillion dollars a year in revenue. This revenue comes from fees
    for connecting merchants and banks, as well as fees charged to consumers for access
    to credit.

    brokers, anti-fraud features, and analytics firms. In addition, being able to
    reject someone from the payments system is a core sovereign power, and the stated
    reason the right is so afraid of a central bank digital currency.

    pricing power among incumbents. As the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau found,
    margins for credit cards are persistent, increasing, high, and tilted [towards
    the larger firms in the industry](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/blog/credit-card-interest-rate-margins-at-all-time-high/).
    (And this is true even when you take higher interest rates into account.)

    While the merger looks like a credit card bank buying another credit card bank
    - and it’s certainly that - it is more like a big tech merger, where a bank is
    trying to turn itself into a platform with an app store-like power over a class
    of customers, in this case merchants. The key quote from Capital One co-founder
    and CEO Richard Fairbank on the call announcing the deal was this: “The holy grail
    is to be an issuer with our own network.”'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Here’s what Fairbank meant. An issuer, aka a bank, is regulated like a bank,
    while a network is regulated like a network, which includes price caps on debit
    cards. But thanks to the Fed, a bank that owns a network *isn’t regulated at all*
    on its network. And because of that, Capital One, if allowed to buy Discover,
    can set prices in ways its rivals can’t. Fairbank also made clear that’s a key
    rationale for the deal, as I’ll go into after I’ve explained the industry and
    the regulatory framework.

- en: Let’s start with the basics of credit/debit cards. Banks make money in two ways.
    They issue cards to consumers, and charge those consumers credit card interest
    charges and various fees when they buy things with merchants and don’t pay the
    money back immediately. But banks also make money from the merchants themselves.
    In between the bank and merchants sits a network utility, usually Visa or Mastercard.
    The network operator takes a swipe fee, known as an ‘interchange fee,’ from the
    merchant, roughly 1.5-3.5% of every transaction, and then splits that fee with
    the banks. Banks send some of that money back to the consumer in the form of rewards
    to keep consumers locked into using that card. Here’s an illustration of how credit
    card networks function.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There’s a difference between American Express and Visa/Mastercard. Visa and
    Mastercard don’t issue their own cards, banks issue them. Conversely, banks don’t
    issue American Express cards, only American Express does that. So American Express
    isn’t a standard credit card network. It is technically a ‘three-party system,’
    between consumers, merchants, and American Express itself. This distinction matters
    for legal reasons. (Though American Express’s status as a three party network
    isn’t strictly accurate, U.S. Bank does [issue](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20131120005381/en/U.S.-Bank-and-American-Express-Announce-Card-Issuing-Agreement)
    credit cards that operate on AMEX).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So what is Discover? Well, it’s both a normal network *and* a three-party system.
    Like Visa/Mastercard, Discover allows banks to issue Discover cards. But like
    American Express, it also issues its own credit cards.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So why does any of this matter? Well, America’s credit card system is a massive
    extraction machine for middlemen, and this merger is part of a knife-fight over
    who can get the biggest piece. [Nowhere else in the world](https://www.lendingtree.com/credit-cards/articles/na-vs-eu-interchangefees/)
    is there a payments system in which 1.5-3.5% of trillions of dollars of transactions
    goes to a set of middlemen, but that’s how credit cards work in America, much
    to the chagrin of merchants, both small ones and the giants like Walmart. Network
    fees are excessive because Visa, Mastercard, American Express, and Discover have
    market power over merchants, who must accept the cards their customers would like
    to use, even if the fee those merchants have to pay is excessive.

- en: In 2010, Congress actually noticed this was a problem, Senator Dick Durbin attached
    an amendment to the Dodd-Frank Act which regulated these networks. Specifically,
    the Durbin Amendment did two things. It had the Fed impose a price cap on swipe
    fees for debit cards, and it allowed merchants to choose among debit networks
    for processing debit payments. While the Fed tilted the rules as far as it could
    towards banks, the Durbin amendment has [delivered](https://www.nationalgrocers.org/news/national-grocers-association-statement-on-federal-reserve-boards-proposal-to-lower-swipe-fees/)
    somewhat for merchants. (The Durbin Amendment only addressed *debit* cards, not
    *credit* cards, and so it left out large chunks of the market. There’s now Senate
    legislation, called the Credit Card Competition Act, which would [allow](https://www.durbin.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/The%20Credit%20Card%20Competition%20Act%20of%202023%20-%20one-pager.pdf)
    merchants to choose among multiple payment networks for credit cards.)

    the Fed [went along](https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R41913) with
    lobbying from [American Express](https://www.federalreserve.gov/SECRS/2011/March/20110303/R-1404/R-1404_022211_67230_584162046602_1.pdf),

    three party networks from regulation, only applying it to Visa and Mastercard.
    And this brings me back to Capital One, whose CEO made this point explicitly on
    the investor call announcing the transaction. Here’s Fairbank:'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The Durbin debit rules, intentionally and by design only applied in networks
    like Visa and MasterCard who negotiate with merchants on behalf of thousands of
    banks, including negotiating terms and pricing. Discover like American Express
    deals directly with merchants without an intermediary. They are both the issuer
    and the network, so there is nobody in between. The Durbin debit rules were written
    to explicitly exclude networks like discover and American Express.
  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    immediately into Discover, though it will only move part of its credit business.
    As Digital Transactions Magazine [put it](https://www.digitaltransactions.net/for-cap-one-the-pulse-network-is-the-rare-asset-in-its-35-3-billion-deal-for-discover/),
    “Fairbank called out a pricing advantage of the planned move into debit.” After
    this merger, Capital One will have millions of merchants at its mercy, merchants
    who will have the choice to either lose customers who want to use Discover, or
    accept higher fees and more intrusive rules from Capital One.

    advantage as a bank and become Too Big to Fail if it acquires Discover. Additionally,
    Discover is a large issuer of credit cards, and the bigger the credit card issuer,
    the [higher the prices](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/newsroom/cfpb-report-finds-large-banks-charge-higher-credit-card-interest-rates-than-small-banks-and-credit-unions/)
    banks tend to charge. If Capital One buys Discover, it’ll jump to number one as
    a credit card issuer. But the pricing power it will acquire as the owner of Discover
    is a core stated reason for the merger.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And to underscore the point about barriers to entry, Fairbank also made that
    clear when he told investors about his lust for Discover’s network, saying that
    “we all kind of revel in the fact that a network is a very, very rare asset. There
    are very few of them. And it’s just, you know, I don’t think people are going
    to be building any of these anytime soon.” That’s not stating outright that the
    goal is monopolization, but it’s pretty close.

    (R-MO) [said on Wednesday](https://twitter.com/HawleyMO/status/1760327925688103140)
    that the deal should be blocked, joining Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who [opposed the

    The Federal Reserve and Office of Comptroller of the Currency would have to allow
    the deal, and then the Antitrust Division would have to give a green light. The
    Fed and the OCC are weak, but they are also embarrassed. And given the CEO stated
    on the acquisition call that the ability to raise prices and reduce competition
    through a regulatory loophole is one of the key reasons for the deal, the Antitrust
    Division strikes me as an unlikely ally of the deal. As Steptoe lawyer Stephen
    Aschettino put it, “I think antitrust is probably first and foremost on the list
    of hurdles that Capital One is going to have to get past, and that could take
    a while.”

    a change in administration, then there will be a different set of bank regulators
    and antitrust enforcers. It’s not clear what happens then. In his first term,
    Donald Trump was lax about banking consolidation, though his Antitrust Division
    did [sue](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-sues-block-visas-proposed-acquisition-plaid)

    it a bit, since there’s no reason Capital One couldn’t just wait until after the
    election to announce the deal. Capital One CEO Richard Fairbank is known as a
    super aggressive operator; he has already [been fined](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2021/09/ftc-fines-capital-one-ceo-richard-fairbank-repeatedly-violating-antitrust-laws)
    for violating antitrust laws multiple times.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If I had to guess, I’d say this one’s about ego, as many of these mergers are.
    Fairbank is a billionaire, and so he won’t be dislodged from his position as CEO
    regardless of whether he has to walk away from the deal. He’s probably thinking,
    swing for the fences, the worst that happens is you strike out. But what this
    deal really shows is that the U.S. payments system is ripe for genuine reform,
    whether that’s through the Fed making its public payments system, called FedNow,
    workable, or Congress enacting more rules mandating competition in payments. Regardless,
    you shouldn’t become a billionaire by grifting on payment fees that no other country
    in the world tolerates. And a merger to enable further bloat and consolidation
    isn’t the way out.
