    felt uncalibrated. To explore this topic, I am reading a book by philosopher Raymond
    Geuss called *A Philosopher Looks at Work*. Geuss examines the modernist notion
    of work, positing that there are six criteria for defining it, with the first
    three constituting its essence:'

    “effort toward some result,” with this narrower modern understanding outlined
    by Geuss. Both are presently necessary to sustain life, yet many people's relationship
    with them is foolish.

    Anonymous, a twelve-step program modeled on Alcoholics Anonymous to help individuals
    overcome “underearning.” They frame being an underearner as a mental disorder
    associated with horrible time management and a poor pursuit of personal potential,
    particularly in how it manifests within the market economy.

    by a [defunct research project](http://web.archive.org/web/20150901000000*/http://www.projecttimeoff.com/)
    advocating for the importance of non-work time as essential for well-being. A
    work martyr experiences guilt when on vacation, compromising their health and
    relationships by pathologically going “above and beyond” and priding themselves
    on their superior work ethic. In truth, they suffer from low self-esteem and place
    the needs of their parents, teachers, or employers above their own, hungry for
    validation.

    school, I significantly underperformed, earning poor grades primarily due to zoning
    out and half-assing homework. This work ethic translated into my work life, where
    I could have won a gold medal for “[goldbricking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldbricking),”
    the art of doing less work while appearing like you are doing more.

    methods such as *Getting Things Done* and *Building a Second Brain*, and being
    bullish on principles such as “[No More Zero Days](https://lessfoolish.substack.com/p/choose-your-hard-practical-principles).”
    More centrally, my time drunkenness is non-existent when I am “daemonically” doing
    something I love, like the writing I am doing now.

    was confused about where they found their endless motivation. According to my
    armchair psychologizing, many work martyrs grew up with “**[learned industriousness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learned_industriousness)**,”
    a work ethic established through positive reinforcement, usually from parents
    or early-life mentors. The fundamental phenomenon can be described as children
    receiving reinforcement for exerting high effort, which also reinforces the *sensation* of
    exerting such effort, thereby conditioning the state of effortfulness as something
    inherently valuable.

    the totalization of work and mistakenly apply their work ethic toward some form
    of spiritual bypassing, meditating for ungodly hours and sacrificing the same
    things as when ensnared by work: friends and community. Conversely, time drunks
    avoided the suffering of learned industriousness and instead suffered from “[learned
    helplessness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learned_helplessness),” or the phrasing
    I prefer more: “**learned laziness**.” Like non-lazy effort was conditioned in
    the work martyrs, lazy non-effort was conditioned in the time drunks.'

    modern work. Aristotle’s view of the “virtuous mean” will be illuminating here.
    He considers the moderate position between the foolish extremes of excess and
    deficiency in character, outlined in *Nicomachean Ethics*. As Aristotle argues,
    virtue lies between the vices at the ends of a foolish spectrum.

- en: What does the virtuous mean between time drunkenness and work martyrdom look
    like? We can find the answer to this by honoring the lesson each fool provides
    us. For the time drunk, the lesson is found in the word “drunk.” To be time drunk
    means to be so “drunk” that one forgets time exists. This forgetfulness is presented
    as a bad thing, given its inefficiency in the market economy. However, forgetting
    time is the right move when it comes to sacred considerations.

- en: 'In philosopher Josef Pieper’s *Leisure: The Basis of Culture,* true leisure
    is a kind of spiritual silence, fostering a timeless state and opening one toward
    the whole. Leisure is not the cessation of work but a contemplative disposition
    that puts work in its proper place. This leisure ontology has gradually dissipated
    from everyday life, with a working ontology capturing more of our “time,” instrumentalizing
    everything toward work. Time drunks deeply intuit this, and their procrastination-induced
    state of timelessness should not be considered a terrible character flaw but rather
    an act of spiritual rebellion against modernity.'

    the other piece, which can be found in the word “martyr.” A martyr sacrifices
    themselves for something other than themselves. In the case of the work martyr,
    they sacrifice their well-being for the validation of others, which often involves
    a never-satisfied father, an overly demanding boss, or a lopsidedly developed
    guru.

    reason toward the wrong person. However, the selfless spirit of their sacrifice
    is correct. While the drunks get the timeless piece right, the martyrs get the
    selfless piece right. One should not be working for their egos, greedily hoarding
    material luxuries, but they should work for [those they live for](https://lessfoolish.substack.com/p/who-are-you-living-for)

    and is 90 mins, with check-ins in the chat at the beginning and an opportunity
    to connect with fellow journalers in breakout rooms at the end. You do not have
    to stay the whole time. If you are in an antisocial mood, you do not have to interact
    with anyone, yet you can still enjoy the coffee shop-esque communal vibe. The
    session concludes with an optional sharing of a passage in the chat. Most of the
    time is spent in silence together, individually inquiring about what matters most.
    A lovely group of people has formed around this practice. The practice occurs
    on weekdays @ 8 AM ET. RSVP link is behind the paywall.*'
