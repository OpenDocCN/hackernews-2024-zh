- en: SpaceWar! was released on a computer produced in 1959 called the PDP-1\. Spacewar!
    is arguably the first digital video game ever created. PDP-1 has been painstakingly
    recreated with the public domain open source code for openFPGA by a 3rd party
    developer. So it can be preserved, studied and played forever without compromises.
