    Their smaller team sizes typically lead to fewer rules, processes, and structures
    (i*.e., wild, wild west*). Additionally, business owners optimize for various
    motivations, including lifestyle, growth, and acquisition, creating a diverse
    and dynamic environment.

    technical resources (*which are often outsourced - again depending on company
    size*), and less defined clarity on roles and responsibilities, making it harder
    to navigate than in small businesses or enterprises (i.e., the bookends).

    the group into two buckets — (1) upper-end of small businesse OR (2) lower-end
    enterprise.
