    It’s a throwback to an earlier space age, with a few tweaks. Mission control is
    not NASA, but a private American company called Intuitive Machines, sending instructions
    to an uncrewed lander about the size of a telephone booth. The spacecraft made
    a nail-biting descent to the lunar surface on Thursday, with a last-minute software
    patch to make up for malfunctioning navigation sensors. One of the spacecraft’s
    legs snagged the surface and [the whole thing tipped over](https://www.cbc.ca/news/science/odysseus-lander-moon-1.7123958),
    landing on its side. But still: It was the first time an American spacecraft had
    landed on the moon in more than 50 years.'

    in lunar exploration since the 1960s. Government agencies and private companies
    in the United States, China, India, Japan, Israel, and the United Arab Emirates
    have all dispatched lunar landers in the past five years, with varying degrees
    of success. Many more missions, both uncrewed and crewed, are in the works. The
    U.S., the only country so far that has set people on the moon, aims to repeat
    the feat as early as 2026, and then start building a sustained presence on the
    surface.

    of moon missions is poised to define the next 50 years of human space travel.
    In the 1970s, after the triumph of the moon landings, NASA and the Soviet Union
    turned away from the moon, focusing instead on building space shuttles and stations.
    But the state of lunar exploration has changed dramatically since Apollo. And
    this time, instead of swinging back to Earth once again, humankind has an opportunity
    to launch itself deeper into the solar system, establishing us even more as a
    spacefaring, possibly interplanetary, species.

    including India’s and China’s. “The moon is not exactly the milestone that it
    would have been 50 years ago, but it does signify a level of capability on particular
    aspiring space powers,” John Logsdon, a space historian and the founder of George
    Washington University’s Space Policy Institute, told me. Whereas the Cold War
    race involved two mighty competitors, the track is now full of both established
    and emergent space powers, some working together to explore the moon.

    key difference between our modern moon fixation and the original edition. Firms
    from Israel and Japan have dispatched spacecraft to the moon, and Intuitive Machines
    is one of 14 firms that NASA has contracted to deliver various lunar payloads
    in the coming years. Its lander rode into space on a rocket built by SpaceX, which
    launches all kinds of payloads at a blistering cadence, serving as Uber for space.
    “Even 10 to 15 years ago, those kinds of launch opportunities were extremely rare,”
    Asif Siddiqi, a space historian and history professor at Fordham University, told
    me. SpaceX is also responsible for building the spacecraft that will deliver NASA
    astronauts to the lunar surface in 2026 through the Artemis program, named for
    Apollo’s sister in Greek mythology.

    and pieces. That’s to be expected: The majority of the entities making these attempts—whether
    Japan’s national space agency or a NASA contractor—are doing so for the first
    time. Yes, technology has come a long way since Apollo, but “we have new technology
    available to us that we’ve never tested in this kind of environment,” Sue Lederer,
    the lead project scientist on NASA’s program for commercial moon missions, told
    me. A crash landing is certainly a disappointing setback, but if and when a given
    team is ready to try again, there are plenty of rides to space available, thanks
    to companies like SpaceX. The attempts will just keep coming. “Barring any unforeseen
    global catastrophe, I don’t see that stopping,” Siddiqi said.'

    of which scientists detected in the 1990s. The Intuitive Machines lander touched
    down near the moon’s south pole, a region of shadowy craters that might harbor
    water ice. Future explorers could melt that water and run it through life-support
    systems, or break out its hydrogen and oxygen to produce rocket fuel—the kind
    of infrastructure you’d need to support a lunar economy. Mining the moon for water
    is still an abstract idea; for one thing, science instruments have yet to determine
    [how icy the lunar south pole actually is](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2019/10/nasa-moon-water/599929/).
    Upcoming missions may find little of economic value, Logsdon said. Or they could
    kick off a full-blown lunar rush.'

    me wrong: I love the moon. Without it, nothing you and I [treasure on this Earth](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2024/01/moon-civilization-empire-building-astronomy/676998/)
    would exist. Still, any Apollo-like program in this day and age is bound to invoke
    a “been there, done that” response, said Logsdon, who witnessed the launch of
    Apollo 11 in person in 1969\. Surveys [show](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/07/20/pew-poll-nasa-priorities/)
    that Americans largely believe that NASA should focus more on climate change and
    monitoring potentially hazardous asteroids. A 21st-century moon landing by astronauts,
    with the first woman and first person of color, will certainly be front-page news.
    But unlike Apollo 11, an Artemis landing is “not going to lead to ticker-tape
    parades through the streets of Manhattan,” Logsdon said.'

    of its members wish that the richest among them spent less time eyeing the heavens
    and more time focused on earthly matters instead. And if you’ve got to go somewhere,
    the moon is a good choice. Some of the space community considers the moon [to
    be a proving ground](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2020/02/nasa-moon-mars-artemis/606499/)
    for human missions to Mars—a giant leap that is much more likely to capture our
    collective attention. A Mars mission is an enormous challenge, and will be for
    a long time. But the moon is *right there*. Why wouldn’t we go?

    exactly where we’ll be in 10 years’ time. Space exploration is always at the mercy
    of shifting budgets and political priorities. If you’d asked experts riding the
    high of the first moon landing about America’s next leap, Siddiqi told me, they
    would have said that astronauts would be on Mars in the 1980s; instead, humans
    have stayed within Earth’s orbit. The Artemis program, for its part, has struggled
    with technical and budget problems, but it has a certain momentum, and the success
    of the newest lander, a precursor to sending people, has only added to it.

    think the world will slip into another lunar lull. “We’re in a very different
    stage of our interaction with space,” he said. In the years since Apollo, humankind
    has dispatched robots across the solar system, built gigantic space telescopes,
    and become comfortable living in the weightlessness of the International Space
    Station. Humans themselves have not traveled beyond the moon, but with the current
    lunar frenzy, our future as an off-world species feels more within reach than
    ever before.
