- en: Demand for wafer fab equipment has been proliferating in recent years, which
    is why fab toolmakers' revenues have also been setting records. As it turns out,
    last year, ASML became the world's largest maker of fab tools, dethroning Applied
    Materials, which was a leader for decades, as observed by analyst [Dan Nystedt](https://twitter.com/dnystedt/status/1758393284353749269).
    While this is hardly competition and there are several reasons why ASML came first,
    it is a remarkable turn of events.

    $26.52 billion, according to Nystedt. There are several things to keep in mind
    here. Firstly, ASML's financial year follows the calendar year, whereas Applied
    Materials's 2023 financial year ended October 29, 2023\. This is why the analyst
    used the company's Q1 FY2024 results (which ended on January 28, 2024) for his
    calculations.

    billions, this is a reasonable comparison that reflects the trends.

- en: There are multiple reasons why ASML managed to take away the fab toolmaking
    crown from Applied Materials. First up, the company [recognized revenue for 53
    Low-NA EUV Twinscan NXE tools](https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/manufacturing/asml-triples-order-bookings-in-q4-2023-thanks-to-demand-for-euv-tools) (up
    from 40 in 2022), each of which costs roughly $183 million. In addition, the company
    recognized revenue for 125 deep ultraviolet lithography tools (up from 81 a year
    before). Secondly, ASML could sell sophisticated tools to Chinese customers for
    most of calendar 2023 as sanctions against the Chinese semiconductor sector kicked
    in only in September and only for one tool. By contrast, sales of tools to Chinese
    clients by Applied Materials were, to a degree, impacted by the U.S. export rules
    introduced in October 2023.

- en: While the turn of the tables is outstanding, this is really not a competition
    because Applied Materials does not produce lithography equipment. In contrast,
    ASML does not make tools for epitaxy, ion implant, deposition, and selective materials
    removal. Meanwhile, virtually no fabs today can run without equipment from Applied
    Materials, ASML, KLA, and Tokyo Electron, so these companies would rather complement
    each other. Furthermore, the more ASML tools sold, the more Applied's equipment
    is required, so both companies are set to thrive in the coming years.
