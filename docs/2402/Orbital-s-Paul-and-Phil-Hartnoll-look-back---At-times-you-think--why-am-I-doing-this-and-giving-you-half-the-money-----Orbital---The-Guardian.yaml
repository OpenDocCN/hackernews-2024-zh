    “I don’t want that”, so I took it instead. I absolutely loved it. When rave arrived
    so did big, baggy clothes and the jumper was perfect. Then one day in 1992, I
    had a hangover and left it on a train on the way into London. I checked lost property,
    but it was never found. I cried. But we did have some good times together. It
    came with me to our first Glastonbury.

    had absolute determination, that “get me the fuck out of here” attitude. My earliest
    memory of my brother sums up his character pretty well. I was three and watching
    telly when I heard a commotion. Phil ran into the sitting room, followed by my
    mum and nan chasing him. They got hold of him and started smacking an arse cheek
    each. I saw his face taking it, but accepting it, too. That’s who Phil is: the
    bloke who acts before he thinks, does what he wants and deals with the consequences
    later. Lots of trouble, but also exciting.'

    When he hit adolescence he would tease and taunt me a bit, and we drifted apart.
    Before then, I would follow him blindly as he was so confident – even though he
    was probably hiding insecurity like most of us do. Phil was known as the hardest
    person in our school as he was a bit of a vigilante. One time, he saw a fifth-year
    picking on a kid who was younger than him in the tuck-shop queue, so he shoved
    the older boy’s head in the dirt. That earned him a reputation for being scary
    and meant anyone who wanted a fight backed off when they found out I was “Hartnoll’s
    brother”.

    what it might be like to be in the Cocteau Twins. Eventually, Phil bought a drum
    machine, I played the guitar, and we began trying to make Cabaret Voltaire-type
    stuff. In his crazy style, Phil decided to go to America to discover hip-hop.
    I thought, “Well, fuck you”, and focused on composing on my own. Once my music
    started taking off, he wanted to join in, too, so we decided to make a band.

    sit in the corner being studious. I was dyslexic, which wasn’t even a word then,
    so I didn’t get on well with school. My mum had lots of problems with her menstrual
    cycle and was on this “housewife drug” called Halcion, but she thought she was
    covering it up. She always said everything was my fault, and Paul grew up absorbing
    that atmosphere. I was a bit of an emotional crutch for her during my adolescence,
    and I wasn’t very equipped for it.

    GP and gave him permission to practise tattoo removal on my arm, which involved
    slicing it off and using a cauterising iron. Then, Mum, feeling bad about what
    she’d done, suggested I get a tattoo to cover up the scar, which I did.

    peace between us.
