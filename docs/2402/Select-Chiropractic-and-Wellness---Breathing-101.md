Breathing 101? I’ve been breathing since day 1, I think I’ve gotten this whole breathing thing down. Breathe in, breathe out, repeat. What else is there?

A lot of different factors led to this post. One – May is National Posture Month! Studies show that poor posture can decrease your lung capacity by up to 30%. Also breathing improperly can lead to other musculoskeletal issues that you may not even realize are a result of poor breathing mechanics.

I always like the saying “good posture is its own reward.” Being able to use your full lung capacity is always a plus! Being able to use it correctly is also helpful!

Time to dig into some anatomy. Check out the image below of all the muscles that are involved in breathing!
