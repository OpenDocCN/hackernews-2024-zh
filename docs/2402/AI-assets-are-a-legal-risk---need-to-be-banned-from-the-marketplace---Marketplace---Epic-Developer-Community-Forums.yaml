    only putting every customer into the danger of their games being rejected or banned
    from Steam, but also into legal risks as these asset sellers do not own the copyrights
    to these images.

    trust the Unreal marketplace any longer. If Epic doesn’t care about copyrights
    for AI assets, how can I trust it cares about the rights of other assets being
    sold on the marketplace?

    the marketplace - which I want to believe, it needs to ban AI generated assets
    from the marketplace.

    2.2.b from the guidelines, or make it clear that the guidelines actually don’t
