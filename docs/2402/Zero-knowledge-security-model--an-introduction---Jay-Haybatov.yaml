- en: Fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) – a technique that allows performing mathematical
    operations directly on encrypted data – can be optionally used for data processing.
    Modern performant FHE systems rely on approximate operations (e.g., get close
    but not exact results of multiplication), which limits their universal adoption.
    Despite this, 4^th^ generation FHE has many useful applications in secure data
    processing.

- en: The zero-knowledge security model shares a part of its name with the zero-knowledge
    proof in cybersecurity. While these concepts are not directly related, they share
    the approach of proving that users have access to certain data without exposing
    any keys or passwords to the other party (server or cloud systems, in case of
    the ZKSM)
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: An application with end-to-end encryption alone does not qualify to be called
    a ‘zero-knowledge’ system as it lacks ways of proving users’ ownership of data/keys.
    For example, a few videoconferencing solutions advertise their end-to-end encryption
    capabilities despite ignoring the identity of parties joining the calls.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The zero-knowledge property must apply to the entire world – except the owner
    of data and her trusted parties. A system that advertises that it does not have
    access to data fulfils only a small fraction of ZKSM requirements. ‘Zero knowledge’
    means that data is unreadable by anyone at storing, transmitting, sharing, and
    processing stages – unless authorised by the data owner.
