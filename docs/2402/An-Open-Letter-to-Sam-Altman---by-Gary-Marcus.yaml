    against the likes of me, writing “[you can grind to help secure our collective
    future or you can write substacks about why we are going fail](https://x.com/sama/status/1756729885215900006?s=20)”.*'

    you working on any technology other than LLMs?)

    uses... But looking back over the past year, it's clear that any benefits we have
    seen today have come at a high cost.](https://www.platformer.news/taylor-swift-deepfake-nudes-x/?ref=platformer-newsletter)”

    would not simply *exacerbate* those costs, grinding down content creators, women,
    and the environment, undermining democracy, destroying jobs, etc?

    humanity? How certain of that bet can we be? What's the rush? (Also, what has
    the $100 billion grind on driverless cars brought society? Might people have rushed
    in too soon, technology-wise?)
