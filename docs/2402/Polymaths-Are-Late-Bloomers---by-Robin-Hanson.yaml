    Seen as a production rather than a consumption strategy, polymathing is mainly
    looking for and building on connections one finds between distant intellectual
    areas. And while I haven’t seen data to confirm it, my personal experience suggests
    a hypothesis: *polymaths peak later in life.*'

  zh: 作为一个多才多艺的人，我在过去的几年里写了很多关于[主题](https://www.overcomingbias.com/p/toward-a-university-department-of-generalistshtml)[多](https://www.overcomingbias.com/p/three-types-of-generalistshtml)[个](https://www.overcomingbias.com/p/polymaths-html)[与](https://www.overcomingbias.com/p/missing-credentialshtml)[多](https://www.overcomingbias.com/p/superhumans-live-among-ushtml)[年](https://www.overcomingbias.com/p/a-perfect-storm-of-inflexibilityhtml)[关于](https://www.overcomingbias.com/p/praise-polymathshtml)多才多艺的文章。多才多艺主要是一种寻找和构建发现的连接的生产策略，而非消费策略。虽然我还没有看到证据来证实这一点，但我的个人经验表明了一个假设：*多才多艺者在生命中的巅峰期较晚*。
- en: Why? Because our key intellectual strategy of looking for connections between
    areas should work better as we learn more areas. And I feel like I see this in
    my own life. While my stamina and raw speed or intensity of thought is probably
    declining with age, knowing more things makes it easier for me to learn the basics
    of each new area. When I seek concrete examples of things, I have a far larger
    library to draw on, and I find closer better examples more easily. And when I
    ponder a puzzle, I can find many more analogies and kinds of explanations to consider.
    Furthermore, I better know roughly want to expect re what sorts of connections
    won’t yet have been found, which are how valuable, and what it would take to test
    them or get folks to listen about them.

  zh: 为什么呢？因为我们的关键知识策略是寻找不同领域之间的连接，在我们学习更多领域时这种策略会更有效。虽然随着年龄的增长，我的耐力和思维速度可能在下降，但了解更多事物使我更容易学习每个新领域的基础知识。当我寻找具体事例时，我有更多的资源可以利用，更容易找到更好的例子。当我思考一个难题时，我可以找到更多类比和解释的方式。此外，我对于哪些连接尚未被发现、哪些连接有多重要以及如何测试它们或让他人关注它们有了更清晰的认识。
- en: Now if there were enough other polymaths out there, none of this would help
    much, as most all the things I found would already have been found by many others.
    But in fact the space of intellectual connections to consider is sparsely populated.
    It is usually easy to find connections that no one else seems to have ever much
    considered.

  zh: 如果还有足够多的多才多艺者存在，这些对我来说并不会太有帮助，因为我发现的大部分东西都已经被其他人发现过了。但事实上，要考虑的知识连接空间是稀疏的。通常很容易找到其他人几乎从未考虑过的连接。
- en: Now the fact that polymaths peak later in life might be a bit discouraging news
    to young polymaths. So yes, they should start out more with the usual non-polymath
    strategy, and then cautiously explore the possibility of dabbling in more areas.

  zh: 多才多艺的人在生命中的巅峰期晚于其他人可能会对年轻的多才多艺者产生些许沮丧的影响。因此，是的，他们应该更多地采用通常的非多才多艺策略开始，然后谨慎地探索涉足更多领域的可能性。
- en: What about the risk that one will pretend to be a polymath as an excuse to dabble
    unproductively in many areas? My strategy is to hold myself to the standards of
    publishing original insights in each new area I allow myself to pursue. If I don’t
    think I could meet that standard, I’ll give the new area a pass.

  zh: 关于一个人会假装成博学者的风险，借此借口在许多领域浅尝辄止，该怎么办？我的策略是要求自己在每个允许自己追求的新领域都达到发表原创见解的标准。如果我认为自己达不到这个标准，我会放弃探索这个新领域。
