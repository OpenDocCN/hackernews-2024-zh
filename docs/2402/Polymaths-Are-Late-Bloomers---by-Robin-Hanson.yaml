    rate of publishing papers peaks [about](https://bigthink.com/neuropsych/at-what-age-are-you-the-smartest/)
    tenure time. Physical sciences peak [earlier](https://www.jstor.org/stable/3447201)
    than social sciences. And per paper, each one has an [equal](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aaf5239)
    chance to be a person’s best paper, regardless of at what age it was written.

    Seen as a production rather than a consumption strategy, polymathing is mainly
    looking for and building on connections one finds between distant intellectual
    areas. And while I haven’t seen data to confirm it, my personal experience suggests
    a hypothesis: *polymaths peak later in life.*'

- en: Why? Because our key intellectual strategy of looking for connections between
    areas should work better as we learn more areas. And I feel like I see this in
    my own life. While my stamina and raw speed or intensity of thought is probably
    declining with age, knowing more things makes it easier for me to learn the basics
    of each new area. When I seek concrete examples of things, I have a far larger
    library to draw on, and I find closer better examples more easily. And when I
    ponder a puzzle, I can find many more analogies and kinds of explanations to consider.
    Furthermore, I better know roughly want to expect re what sorts of connections
    won’t yet have been found, which are how valuable, and what it would take to test
    them or get folks to listen about them.

    much, as most all the things I found would already have been found by many others.
    But in fact the space of intellectual connections to consider is sparsely populated.
    It is usually easy to find connections that no one else seems to have ever much
    considered.

    to young polymaths. So yes, they should start out more with the usual non-polymath
    strategy, and then cautiously explore the possibility of dabbling in more areas.

- en: What about the risk that one will pretend to be a polymath as an excuse to dabble
    unproductively in many areas? My strategy is to hold myself to the standards of
    publishing original insights in each new area I allow myself to pursue. If I don’t
    think I could meet that standard, I’ll give the new area a pass.
