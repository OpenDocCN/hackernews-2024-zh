    to the Berlin University of the Arts, where he worked on sound art pieces. In
    2006, he became interested in urban soundscapes. A student project brought him
    to the neighborhood of Adlershof, formerly in East Berlin, to study the changing

    by the track’s racing vehicles. “Obviously, the cars are just one aspect of the
    sound,” he told me. “The helicopters, all the people going through that whole
    area in large numbers — if you want a real impact assessment, you should do the
    whole thing.”

    birdsong doesn’t tell the whole story of a species. When Slabbekoorn used to take
    the train from Leiden to Amsterdam, he would walk past an area with big, beautiful
    trees populated by robins. Then one day, the trees were cut down.

    the only remnants of their home. “Most territorial birds, they do not get a second
    chance” to establish themselves in any area, Slabbekoorn said. “It’s their territory,
    and that’s for life.” The robins were singing; only it was a dirge.

    were joyful. We’d walked from the Admiralbrücke along the canal to the Urbanhafen,
    a small former container port. If we hadn’t been discussing sound just then, it
    might have been difficult to consciously realize the calm I felt: The traffic
    was rare and slow. The nearby thoroughfare was inaudible. The trees were intact.
    No leaf blowers sputtered; no Teslas farted.'

    people chatted around us. Kusitzky recalled a day in the ‘90s when the canal froze
    over, describing to me the sound of skate blades on ice. Swans floated by on the
    hardly perceptible current. We were in the middle of the city, but the acoustic
    environment was bracingly crisp and clean. Kusitzky and I spoke softly, about
    complicated things, and understood each other.

    values, but they made an exquisite sound.
