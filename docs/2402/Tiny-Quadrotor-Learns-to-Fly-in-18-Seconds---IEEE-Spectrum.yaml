- en: It’s kind of astonishing how quadrotors have scaled over the past decade. Like,
    we’re now at the point where they’re verging on disposable, at least from a commercial
    or research perspective—for a bit over US $200, you can buy a little [27-gram,
    completely open-source drone](https://www.bitcraze.io/products/crazyflie-2-1/),
    and all you have to do is teach it to fly. That’s where things do get a bit more
    challenging, though, because teaching drones to fly is not a straightforward process.
    Thanks to good simulation and techniques like reinforcement learning, it’s much
    easier to imbue drones with autonomy than it used to be. But it’s not typically
    a fast process, and it can be finicky to make a smooth transition from simulation
    to reality.

- en: 'New York University’s [Agile Robotics and Perception Lab](https://wp.nyu.edu/arpl/)
    in collaboration with the [Technology Innovation Institute](https://www.tii.ae/)
    (TII) have managed to streamline the process of getting basic autonomy to work
    on drones, and streamline it by a lot: The lab’s system is able to train a drone
    in simulation from nothing up to stable and controllable flying in 18 seconds
    flat on a MacBook Pro. And it actually takes longer to compile and flash the firmware
    onto the drone itself than it does for the entire training process.'

    nudges and wind, but it’s also able to fly specific trajectories. Not bad for
    18 seconds, right?

- en: 'One of the things that typically slows down training times is the need to keep
    refining exactly what you’re training for, without refining it so much that you’re
    only training your system to fly in your specific simulation rather than the real
    world. The strategy used here is what the researchers call a curriculum (you can
    also think of it as a sort of lesson plan) to adjust the reward function used
    to train the system through reinforcement learning. The curriculum starts things
    off being more forgiving and gradually increasing the penalties to emphasize robustness
    and reliability. This is all about efficiency: Doing that training that you need
    to do in the way that it needs to be done to get the results you want, and no
    more.'

    speed as well. The deep-reinforcement learning algorithms are particularly efficient,
    and leverage the hardware acceleration that comes along with Apple’s M-series
    processors. The simulator efficiency multiplies the benefits of the curriculum-driven
    sample efficiency of the reinforcement-learning pipeline, leading to that wicked-fast
    training time.

    any drone, including bigger and more expensive ones, or even a drone that you
    yourself build from scratch.

    drone in the video above, although the researchers expect that 18 seconds is achievable
    even for a more complex drone like this in the near future. And it’s all [open
    source](https://github.com/arplaboratory/learning-to-fly), so you can, in fact,
    build a drone and teach it to fly with this system. But if you wait a little bit,
    it’s only going to get better: The researchers tell us that they’re working on
    integrating with the PX4 open source drone autopilot. Longer term, the idea is
    to have a single policy that can adapt to different environmental conditions,
    as well as different vehicle configurations, meaning that this could work on all
    kinds of flying robots rather than just quadrotors.'

  zh: 我们被告知，在上述视频中训练无人机的策略花费的时间不是几秒钟，而是几分钟，尽管研究人员预计，即使是对于未来更复杂的无人机，如此，18秒也是可以实现的。而且这一切都是[开源的](https://github.com/arplaboratory/learning-to-fly)，所以实际上，你可以用这个系统构建一个无人机并教它飞行。但如果你再等一会儿，情况将会变得更好：研究人员告诉我们，他们正在努力与PX4开源无人机自动驾驶仪集成。长期来看，这个想法是拥有一个单一的策略，可以适应不同的环境条件，以及不同的车辆配置，这意味着它可以在各种飞行机器人上运行，而不仅仅是四轴飞行器。
