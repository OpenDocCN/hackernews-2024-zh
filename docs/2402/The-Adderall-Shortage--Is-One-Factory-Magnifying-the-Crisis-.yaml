    a drug manufacturer that operates out of Central Islip, Long Island, with an unusual
    request. She wanted to know if the company could bypass her pharmacy and directly
    fill her son’s prescription for the medication he took to treat attention deficit
    hyperactivity disorder. Ascent isn’t in the business of distributing a few pills
    here and there: In 2022, according to one research firm, it produced 12 percent
    of the country’s generic version of Adderall and large amounts of its generic
    Concerta, Ritalin, and Vyvanse. But now there was a global shortage of the drugs,
    and inquiries from people desperate to fill a prescription were becoming more
    common.'

    rang Ascent with a similar question. Then another woman got in touch, saying she’d
    contacted 30 pharmacies without any luck. In the months ahead, Ascent fielded
    a dozen more calls from patients across the U.S. They all received some version
    of the same answer: Ascent had no information to give them.'

    causes: manufacturing problems, labor issues, supply-chain failures, and a huge
    rise in demand during the pandemic. But Ascent claims there’s another factor exacerbating
    the shortage, one that’s completely sui generis: the fact that it’s been shut
    down by the Drug Enforcement Administration.'

    millions of pills to go unaccounted for. Ascent makes painkillers in addition
    to stimulants, and, amid the ongoing opioid epidemic, the DEA has been under pressure
    to show it is aggressively policing the industry. (The agency did not respond
    to requests for comment.) Ascent has said that its paperwork is in order and has
    sued the Department of Justice to get its assembly lines working again.

    is producing zero ADHD meds. If its claims are true, that’s 600 million doses
    per year missing from the market. As Ascent says in its lawsuit, “Turning off
    that supply is making a grave situation infinitely worse.”

    sterile white hallways connects 105 manufacturing rooms, some of them containing
    large, intricate machines capable of producing 400,000 tablets per hour. In one
    of these rooms, Ascent’s founder and CEO — Sudhakar Vidiyala, Meghana’s father
    — points to a hulking unit that he says is worth $1.5 million. It’s used to produce
    time-release Concerta tablets with three colored layers, each dispensing the drug’s
    active ingredient at a different point in the tablet’s journey through the body.
    “About 25 percent of the generic market would pass through this machine,” he says.
    “But we didn’t make a single pill in 2023.”

    a former DEA compliance officer turned pharma consultant, and Ascent’s CFO. The
    group suits up in gowns and hairnets to observe the limited operations at the
    plant, which is still permitted to make drugs with non-controlled substances,
    such as ibuprofen and acetaminophen. In one room, an employee climbs a stepladder
    to scoop powder into the top of a machine. Someone in the group compares the process
    of making Adderall and other drugs to “baking a cake”: The ingredients must be
    sifted, mixed, and poured according to a recipe. The place is a literal confectionery.'

    size and an enormous vault nested inside. The effect is a little like coming upon
    the Temple of Dendur at the Met. The vault is built to the government’s security
    specifications — the floor, ceiling, and walls are all made of concrete ten inches
    thick, and the towering doors are guarded 24 hours a day. Ordinarily, this is
    where Ascent stores huge volumes of the controlled substances it needs to make
    drugs and the finished doses before they are shipped to its wholesaler, Camber
    Pharmaceuticals. (Both Ascent and Camber are owned by Hetero, a pharma company
    based in India.) Instead, it sits almost entirely empty. “It’s tough to see,”
    says Sudhakar. “I still can’t really digest it.”

    to the DEA for allotments of raw chemical components. In Ascent’s case, that includes
    amphetamine (an active ingredient in Adderall), methylphenidate (Ritalin and Concerta),
    and lisdexamfetamine (Vyvanse). The system allows the DEA to control the nation’s
    supply of dangerous substances, monitoring them from their inception as aggregate
    batches of raw molecules to their dispersion at the pharmacy in the form of finished
    tablets, capsules, or other form factors.

    the DEA would approve them by July. Instead, the agency informed Ascent that it
    would be audited. Investigators visited Ascent’s offices to examine its books,
    and in November, an attorney asked the company to explain some discrepancies the
    agency had found.

    regulatory form that tracks every batch of raw material that enters a factory
    and every finished pill that is shipped out. Ascent’s employees maintained one
    set of what the company called “working” 222s and one set of “official” ones that
    it filed to the government. To the DEA, this was impermissibly sloppy.

    “Every single time DEA identified a variation, we showed that there was actually
    zero missing. We have an invoice for each pill that we produced,” he says. But
    the company has acknowledged that it committed infractions. For example, orders
    struck from 222s must be crossed out with a line and the word *cancel* written
    next to them. Investigators found two instances in which Ascent employees had
    drawn the line but failed to write the word.

    shuts down a company for that.” In May 2023, after more than a year of going back
    and forth with the DEA, Ascent began laying off workers. In September, Walden
    filed a lawsuit to compel the government to give a formal response to Ascent’s
    2023 quota request. The next day, the DEA served the company with an “order to
    show cause” — a notice that it intended to revoke its registrations as a drug
    manufacturer and analytical lab.

    into Ascent had been part of an investigation called Operation Bottleneck, an
    effort to rein in lax recordkeeping by drug manufacturers that had contributed
    to the opioid epidemic. “These companies have a legal obligation to account for
    every dose and every pill,” Anne Milgram, head of the DEA, said in a press release.
    In the face of an ongoing epidemic that had taken more than 110,000 lives in 2022,
    the DEA was “using every available tool to prevent the diversion and misuse of
    opioids and other highly addictive controlled substances.”

- en: The DEA didn’t distinguish between Ascent’s production of ADHD meds, which are
    stimulants, and its painkillers, which are narcotics. (According to Walden, 80
    percent of the company’s controlled-substances revenue comes from stimulants and
    20 percent from painkillers.) It alleged that Ascent had “failed to make records
    available for inspection in a timely manner and shipped controlled substances
    without producing required documentation” and that it “did not accurately account
    for millions of dosages” of oxycodone, methylphenidate, hydrocodone, amphetamines,
    and other drugs.

- en: For the DEA, Operation Bottleneck was a step toward redemption. During the painkiller
    epidemic, as state attorneys general and local governments brought hundreds of
    cases against opioid manufacturers and distributors, they routinely cited the
    DEA’s poor monitoring of the companies’ records as a factor that helped flood
    the country with OxyContin and similar drugs. Those suits eventually compelled
    large drug companies to pay $26 billion — the biggest such settlement since the
    tobacco case of 1998\. “DEA got the crap beat out of them,” says Krista Tongring,
    a former section chief in the agency’s office of compliance who now consults for
    Ascent. “They’re like, ‘We have to do something.’”

- en: Ascent’s lawsuit against the DEA describes the agency’s sanctions as “a clear
    and ill-conceived overcorrection and reaction to the criticism it received for
    mishandling of opioid abuse.” The suit also goes further, alleging that the DEA’s
    action reflects “a drug policy that is focused on controlling supply.” That language
    comes close to accusing the DEA of backdoor policy-making through regulation,
    as if the shortage of ADHD medications is the agency’s intent. Experts I spoke
    to dismissed that theory as far-fetched. “The DEA is a pretty straight agency.
    I can’t see them getting together with the FDA and saying, ‘Let’s just restrict
    quota.’ There must be a justification to increase or decrease quota,” says Joseph
    Rannazzisi, a former deputy assistant administrator of the DEA office of diversion
    control, the division that investigates the pharmaceutical industry.

    drug companies for feeding the country’s nascent opioid addiction in the mid-2000s
    — is alarmed by the rapid rise in prescriptions for Adderall and similar drugs
    in recent years. “Everybody is concerned about the increase in use of stimulants,
    not just the DEA and the FDA,” says Rannazzisi. “The bottom line is that I think
    we do have a problem.”

    active ingredient is amphetamine, a drug that functions in some ways like cocaine.
    Both deliver excess dopamine to the brain, enhancing motivation and concentration,
    and the cocainelike effect of stimulants is enhanced when they’re snorted. Hence
    the  long-standing nickname for Concerta and Ritalin: Diet Coke. “There is a fear
    that the overuse of prescribed amphetamines could lead to the equivalent of another
    opioid epidemic,” said Dr. Joshua Sharfstein, who served as the FDA’s principal

    many people suffer from it. Some studies put the range at 3 to 5 percent of the
    population, while others estimate it’s as high as 15 percent. That’s because definitions
    and diagnoses of ADHD vary, and can involve factors that are hard to measure objectively.
    The DSM instructs evaluators to use a [scoring method](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK519712/table/ch3.t3/)
    in which points are assigned if, say, a patient “often has difficulty organizing
    tasks” or “often loses things.” Some doctors may still use a version of the Conners
    Rating Scale, the first ADHD test developed in the 1970s. The scale’s developer
    later expressed deep concern over how easily evaluators were making the diagnosis.
    “The numbers make it look like an epidemic. Well, it’s not. It’s preposterous,”
    Dr. Keith Conners told the New York *Times* in 2013, four years before his death.
    “This is a concoction to justify the giving out of the medication at unprecedented
    and unjustified levels.”

    45 percent from about a decade earlier. Doctors now use the drugs to treat a range
    of issues beyond ADHD, including narcolepsy and long COVID, and for behavioral
    and mood regulation in children. Notably, usage during the pandemic soared among
    adults, many of whom were struggling with unstructured days.

- en: No one can say how much of the recent surge in prescriptions is attributable
    to late diagnoses of ADHD versus misdiagnoses, but one thing is clear. It became
    much easier to get a prescription during the pandemic, in part because the DEA
    began allowing health-care providers to write prescriptions for controlled substances
    without meeting patients in person. The change allowed telehealth providers to
    issue stimulant prescriptions after relatively short video consultations, and
    many believe the shift ushered in abuse. In April 2022, a former executive at
    Cerebral, a telehealth start-up, filed a lawsuit claiming the company had pushed
    prescribers to write more scripts for ADHD meds because its data showed that patients
    were more likely to remain Cerebral customers if they’d been prescribed a stimulant.
    (A spokesperson for Cerebral denied the allegations, saying the company has never
    instructed providers to prescribe any drug in any quantity.) Cerebral stopped
    issuing the prescriptions the next month and disclosed that federal investigators
    had begun looking into the company; no charges were brought.

    at large chains, including Walmart, CVS, and Walgreens, are reluctant to fill

    similar stimulants have been driven to extremes. They’ve rationed, splitting up
    tablets or breaking up capsules; they’ve spent hours driving to distant pharmacies;
    they’ve purchased pills on Craigslist or sought out dubious distributors in Mexico
    — anything to get their medication. “It’s a strange experience to be calling a

    the DEA because the drugs simply don’t carry the same risks as opioids. “This

    says Jack Teitelman, a former DEA agent. He is now the president of Titan Group,

    which serves the 1,370 upstate residents of Oxford from a small storefront near

    pharmacy. During the shortage, Ferrarese has been getting calls from people who
    live hours away, but she’s hesitant to take on new customers trying to fill ADHD
    scripts. “The last thing you want to do as a pharmacy is look like you’re an Adderall-pill

    remaining 28 doses. (She later found another pharmacy with 11 pills, but getting
    them required obtaining another prescription.)
