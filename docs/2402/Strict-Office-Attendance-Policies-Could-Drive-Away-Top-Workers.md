# Strict Office Attendance Policies Could Drive Away Top Workers

If you're a star at work but your boss makes you head into the office, you're more likely to start hunting for a new gig.

​​Gartner defined the high-performers as those advancing more quickly in their career than their peers.

The findings from a survey of nearly 2,100 white-collar workers come as major employers, from banks to tech companies, push their people to head to the office. UPS on Tuesday announced big [cuts to its executive ranks](https://www.businessinsider.com/ups-layoffs-ceo-soft-demand-high-labor-costs-2024-1) and said it would require those remaining to be in five days a week. Other major companies have said employees who skip their commutes could [pay a price in their reviews](https://www.businessinsider.com/rto-return-to-office-mandate-be-fired-amazon-meta-2023-10).

The cubicle callback also comes amid mixed signals on [how important it is to always be in the office](https://www.businessinsider.com/are-remote-jobs-more-productive-work-life-balance-return-office-2023-8). One recent study suggested companies that [require time in the office](https://www.businessinsider.com/return-to-office-mandates-remote-work-stock-returns-productivity-2024-1) actually aren't more profitable or productive. But the effect of rigid RTO requests isn't necessarily limited to what shows up on a balance sheet, Caitlin Duffy, a research director in the Gartner HR practice, told Business Insider.

"Return-to-office mandates are a very risky proposition. They may be more about what leaders want than what really benefits employees, both personally and professionally," Duffy said.

Gartner's survey, conducted from May through June 2023, showed that employees, in general, were 8% less likely to want to stick around when bosses put in an inflexible RTO mandate. Among women, 11% were less likely to want to stay. That's partly because women often value flexibility and might feel they face less bias when they're not in the office, according to the survey.

And among millennials, who Gartner said were most likely to have to juggle caregiving duties, tight rules about being in the office made them 10% less likely to want to stay at their jobs.

Of course, wanting to quit and leaving are two different things. Still, Duffy said, having unhappy workers stick around can be its own risk.

"You're not going to get the best out of those employees if they're people who are looking to leave at the next possible opportunity," she said.

Duffy said there's a benefit to bringing workers together. The survey showed employee engagement rose for most workers, particularly Gen Zers, when they were required to be in the office. But, she said, it doesn't have to be every day.

Workers are more likely to buy into a trip to the office when they understand why going in would be helpful and when they've had a hand in crafting the office policy.

"That is going to be a lot more successful than an arbitrary requirement," Duffy said.

Taking attendance at the office can also rankle high-performing employees, she said, because they're often stretched and need autonomy to work in a way that's best for them. As a result of their performance, they should be trusted to structure their workdays and have flexibility.

"What leaders often get wrong is thinking that employees are just trying to do less work or get more out of their companies," Duffy said. "Employees want to perform well, and they want to be trusted — and they know their work best."
