    he pointed out a solution that he had found to describe space. That was to measure
    the total depth of the space, or in this scenario, a room. The number indicated
    the joint score of how many steps away from each room to every other room. The
    colors represented numerical values which provided an effective visualization
    of simultaneous relations in spatial layouts. The lower the score, the fewer steps
    it would have taken to walk to that room, thus busier and vice versa. He had concluded
    that the movement of people inside the space was mainly (about 70%) determined
    by the layout of the space, not the content. /

    more "important" and higher-quality pages higher in the search results than less
    important pages. But how does the search engine know which pages are more important
    than other pages? In PageRank's algorithm, a website is more important if it is
    linked to by other important websites, and links from less important websites
    have their links weighted less. This definition seems a bit circular, but it turns
    out that there are multiple strategies for calculating these rankings.
