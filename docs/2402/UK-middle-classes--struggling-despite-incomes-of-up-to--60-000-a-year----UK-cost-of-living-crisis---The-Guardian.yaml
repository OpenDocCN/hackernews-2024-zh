    of a precarious middle class struggling to maintain a decent living standard on
    household incomes as high as £60,000 a year, a [report](https://www.financialfairness.org.uk/docs?editionId=0c5416f6-c2a2-477c-9e12-b10e00a78b98)

    said the uncertain nature of work meant there was a one in three chance that someone
    earning a middle income today would not be doing so next year.

    said 20% of those in the middle fifth of the income distribution were struggling
    to pay for food and other essentials. “It is people earning between £30,000-£60,000
    a year, depending on the type of household, people who you would expect to be
    doing OK,” he said.

    living crisis, the vulnerabilities of people on modest incomes have become more
    apparent. They face significant uncertainties, and are rightly encouraged to save
    both for rainy days and their retirement,” Hirsch said.

    has been working for their present employer for less than two years, or less than
    three years if working part-time. It also classifies very low-paid full-time jobs
    – where pay is less than half the full-time average – as insecure.

    work, higher housing costs and be repaying student debt.”
