"Some of the best explanations that I've ever come across for some quite complex tools...will have readers saying 'Aha!'"
**—IT World**

"Well-structured, well-written...a highly enjoyable read into the inner workings behind these applications we take for granted."
**—BCS, The Chartered Institute for IT**

"The author explains the concepts in easy language, with simple diagrams. The curious reader will be able to 'unmask the magic' or mystery of how software works."
—**Computing Reviews**

"Explains, in uncompromisingly non-technical terms, how computers achieve their magic."
[**—Phil Bull**](https://philbull.wordpress.com/2015/12/07/book-review-how-software-works/)

"These high-level descriptions are clear and accurate. They will be useful to anyone who is curious and wants to understand from a conceptual level, rather than only from a language-specific detail level. This is not a book about implementation, rather one about understanding."
[**—Matthew Helmke**](http://matthewhelmke.net/2015/10/how-software-works/)

"The ideal audience for this book is bright adults who aren’t programmers, but want some appreciation of the hidden complexity behind much of what goes on on the internet."
[**—David Merkel**](http://alephblog.com/2015/09/12/book-review-how-software-works/)

"An excellent book."
[—**iProgrammer**](http://www.i-programmer.info/bookreviews/20-theory/9436-how-software-works.html)

"*How Software Works* will give you a fascinating look into the software all around you. Impressively well written, organized and presented, *How Software Works* is very highly recommended for high school, community, college, and university library Computer Science reference collections."
