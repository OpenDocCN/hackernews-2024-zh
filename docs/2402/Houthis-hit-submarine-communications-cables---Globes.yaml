- en: Three months after the Houthis began attacking merchant ships, the Yemenite
    rebels have carried out another one of their threats. "Globes" has learned that
    four submarine communication cables have been damaged in the Red Sea between Jeddah
    in Saudi Arabia and Djibouti in East Africa.

    EIG and TGN. This is causing serious disruption of Internet communications between
    Europe and Asia, with the main damage being felt in the Gulf countries and India.

- en: Estimates are that the damage to communications activities is significant but
    not critical because other cables pass through the same region linking Asia, Africa
    and Europe that have not been hit. The repair of such a large number of underwater
    cables may take at least eight weeks according to estimates and involve exposure
    to risk from the Houthi terror organization. The telecommunications companies
    will be forced to look for companies that will agree to carry out the repair work
    and probably pay them a high risk premium.
