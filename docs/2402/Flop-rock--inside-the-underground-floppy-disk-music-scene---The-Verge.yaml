    into a USB floppy drive that I bought from an online merchant working out of Singapore’s
    [onetime hotbed of ’90s computer piracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sim_Lim_Square).
    I’m briefly startled by the drive’s low mechanical whirring — a warm, ambient
    background score that instantly transports me back to my childhood. Some of my
    first painfully preteen journals were hidden poorly on nondescript floppies just
    like this one. I click on the disk’s sole file, an MP3 titled “Inability to Perform
    Social Activities Is Considered Inferior,” and [Yasuyuki Uesugi](https://www.discogs.com/artist/7521416-Yasuyuki-Uesugi)’s
    growling wall of experimental noise rolls through my apartment like a rogue wave
    at the beach. The track is one minute, 27 seconds long, and at 1.33MB, it almost
    hits the diskette’s limit of 1.44MB.

    Eoforwine, in an “extreme” format. “I found some sealed packages [of floppy disks]
    in the attic at our old house, so it seemed like a good idea,” he says. “I was
    already familiar with Discogs.com, so I made a proper entry for the release, also
    made a small blog and a Facebook page for the label.” Within a month, a guy from
    Greece messaged about releasing a floppy demo; soon, Windisch was running Floppy
    Kick, getting to know other floppy enthusiasts, and swapping releases with other
    floppy labels. “[I had] first used floppy diskettes (the larger, flexible ones)
    for my C64 computer when I was young,” he adds, recalling childhood video game
    swaps as well as his father’s use of floppies to transfer MIDI files from his
    synths to his laptop. “I just like how limited the format is, and it’s not easy
    to show something in such a small amount of data.”

    in lobit subculture, which [celebrates low-bitrate music](https://dozerblog.blogspot.com/2005/05/netlabel-profile-20kbps-rec.html)
    as a form of art and practicality. The added fact that floppies aren’t made for
    long-term storage also forces their users to confront the transience of art and
    information in the face of time and decay. In 1993, Billy Idol launched a multimedia

    stack](http://www.streettech.com/bcp/)) that arguably left more of a mark on pop
    culture than the album. In 2009, artist and professor [Florian Cramer](http://floriancramer.nl/)
    compressed [every Oscars Best Film nominee onto a single floppy disk](http://floppyfilms.pleintekst.nl/oscars_2009/),
    so that each was represented by an abstract, almost Mark Rothko-like moving image.

    it morphed into a full-blown research project on obsolete media as cultural phenomena.
    “We had also cassette events and minidisc events, at one point even mechanical
    music events with punch cards,” Hilkmann explains on a Zoom call. Around the same
    time, they came across the then-thriving floppy scene in the Netherlands, mostly
    through the underground review blog [Yeah I Know It Sucks](https://yeahiknowitsucks.wordpress.com/),

    to make sample-based music,” he explains, sticking to low sample rates, short
    samples, and mono / single-channel sound to keep file sizes small. “I had to do
    quite a lot of experimenting with lobit encoding to be able to make the music
    sound good (to my ears) and also to optimize the space of the floppy to contain
    around 10 minutes of music in which the sounds were listenable and distinguishable.”
    In his mind, it became a sort of sport to make these 10-minute mini-albums, with
    the added advantage that the data loss inherent in extreme lobit would produce
    “nice ringing tones.”

- en: Nobuko believes the proliferation of floppy music in Western cultures is linked
    to strong punk movements with a DIY aesthetic. “Also, the lobit scene seems to
    be bigger in countries that had bad internet connections, so they would already
    use lobit encoding to upload or download things online,” he explains. In a similar
    vein, Hilkmann believes that floppy recordings are an explicitly anti-capitalist
    niche that exists outside the usual means of publishing music today on Spotify
    and other streaming services. “A medium, artistically, is only interesting as
    long as it’s available,” he says. “Now that floppy disks are becoming more and
    more difficult to get, they’ve become more and more a collector’s item almost,
    while a few years ago, it was more like almost a trashy medium that you could
    quickly get your hands on and do fun things with.”

- en: Hilkmann and Walskaar soon realized that the floppy world — at least the one
    they were able to explore — was mostly Western-oriented, with artists and musicians
    based in the US, Europe, and occasionally Canada. “With the language barrier,
    it’s a huge issue,” says Walskaar. “If you cannot search for it, it’s really hard
    to find.” He informs me that the word for “floppy disk” varies by country, not
    to mention numerous variable words for different music subcultures and local slang.
    “The most famous example,” says Hilkmann with a grin, “is that in South Africa,

    record pages don’t have embedded playable tracks, which means the only way to

    meet new customers, especially those who go out of their way to follow the artists

    Persky, the self-described “last man standing” in the floppy business, supposedly

    doesn’t really know the exact value of his stock. Walskaar recalls that 10 years

    them at you for free, basically.” Today, it’s a different story. “Now, if you
    go on eBay or any other version of eBay and try to find floppies actually, price-wise,
    they’re pretty expensive,” he says. “If you want new old stocks or unused old

    in a way.” Hilkmann sees the floppy as a memento mori. “It shows us that nothing
    is eternal and everything that seems to be very vague or obscure, especially in
    the digital realm, isn’t that at all and will also eventually move away, change,
    and is something that we can also change for our own memories and on our own accord,”

- en: Cramer, the filmmaker who made the best Oscars films floppy and ruthlessly dissected
    David Cronenberg’s film adaptation of *Naked Lunch* to fit on a 3.5-inch, once
    said that the “[floppy disk should die](https://www.wired.co.uk/article/why-the-floppy-disk-just-wont-die),”
    pointing to their useless, toxic plasticness in a world where it shouldn’t exist.
    Turning my new Floppy Kick orders over in my hands, I understand the thought behind
    Cramer’s words but remain torn between waves of sentimentality not just for the
    place of floppies in history but their presence as a tangible part of my own life.

  zh: 制作奥斯卡最佳电影软盘并且无情地解剖大卫·克朗伯格改编的《裸午》以适应3.5英寸的电影制片人克莱默曾说过，“[软盘应该消失](https://www.wired.co.uk/article/why-the-floppy-disk-just-wont-die)，”指出它们在一个不应存在的世界中的无用、有毒塑料性质。我手中握着新的软盘启动订单，我理解克莱默话语背后的思想，但在历史上软盘的地位以及作为我生活中实际部分的感情波澜之间，我仍感到矛盾。
- en: Nobuko, too, shares my inclination for sentimentality. “I don’t agree with Florian
    about how floppies should die, even though of course [they] will in the end,”
    he says. “I think it is nice to be able to hold something in your hand, to collect
    something that becomes precious to you. I find it great that there is the option
    to stream music, it lets you listen and discover music that we might not find
    otherwise.” This, he says, is significant in a period where internet platforms
    and music sites have proven to be unreliable, unstable, or unethical about artist
    payments. Even so, the floppy must be protected; throughout his email to me, he
    also shows concern for the delicate nature of floppies and the ever-present threat
    of magnets — the enemy of any self-respecting floppy collector.

  zh: 信彦也与我分享了对感伤情怀的倾向。“我不同意弗洛里安关于软盘应该消失的观点，尽管当然最终它们会消失，”他说。“我认为能够拿着手上的东西、收集成为对你来说珍贵的东西是很好的。我发现可以流式传输音乐的选择很棒，它让我们能够听到和发现我们可能无法找到的音乐。”他说，在互联网平台和音乐网站被证明不可靠、不稳定或者在艺术家支付方面不道德的时期，这是重要的。即便如此，软盘必须受到保护；在他写给我的电子邮件中，他还对软盘的脆弱性和磁铁的永恒威胁表现出关注
    —— 这是任何自尊的软盘收藏者的敌人。
- en: In Nobuko’s eyes, they’re a sort of mysterious treasure, cloaked in offline
    exclusivity and very real scarcity. “To me, the floppy represents a couple of
    things,” he says. “Nostalgia, but also a punk ethos. It feels highly personal.
    The floppy, as fragile as it is, has to be handled carefully. The label or musician
    has put a lot of thoughts in it. And I do think that they are adorable.”

  zh: 在信彦看来，它们是一种神秘的宝藏，被线下的独特性和极度的稀缺性所笼罩着。“对我来说，软盘代表了一些东西，”他说。“怀旧，但也包含朋克精神。它感觉非常个人化。软盘虽然很脆弱，但必须小心处理。厂牌或音乐家在其中投入了很多心思。我认为它们很可爱。”
