    to a 2014 [report](https://www.epi.org/publication/epidemic-wage-theft-costing-workers-hundreds/)
    by the Economic Policy Institute, workers lose over $50bn a year to wage theft
    from employers. Wage theft includes tactics from stiffing workers on pay, failing
    to properly pay workers for overtime, minimum wage violations, misclassification
    of employees as independent contractors, and not providing workers with mandated
    break times.

    of Labor recovered $47,393 in unpaid overtime wages to 21 workers in Utah. Last
    year, the department ordered Unforgettable Coatings and its owner Cory Summerhays
    to pay 593 workers over $3.6m in stolen wages, damages, interest and penalties.

    Unforgettable Coatings falsified employment records to deprive workers of overtime
    pay, intimidated workers from speaking up about the practices and forced workers
    to volunteer to work on weekends without pay. The intimidation included threatening
    to call immigration services on workers and reducing workers’ hours and pay if
    they were suspected to be cooperating with the department’s investigation.

    a result of the investigation. He now works in the construction industry as a

    of misclassification and the utilization of this labor broker system. In the last
    six years in some parts of the country this is almost exclusively the business
    model,” said Smith. “Basically what employers do, they go out, find two to three
    labor brokers who are usually former employees who have connections in the immigrant
    community. They recruit folks, hire folks on 1099s, usually working them more
    than 40 hours a week.”

    often also takes advantage of the brokers, who aren’t well informed about what
    they’re getting into, or the amount of costs and labor required for the job sites
    they’re put in charge of finding workers for. This system, Smith said, allows
    employers to get away with not paying overtime wages, taxes, avoids unionization
    efforts and disenfranchises employers who do things the right way.
