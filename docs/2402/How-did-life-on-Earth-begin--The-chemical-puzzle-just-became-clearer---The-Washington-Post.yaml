- en: People have long scratched their heads trying to understand how life ever got
    going after the formation of Earth billions of years ago. Now, chemists have partly
    unlocked the recipe by creating a complex compound essential to all life — in
    a lab.

- en: Like making the ingredients of a cake, researchers have successfully created
    a compound critical for metabolism in all living cells, which is essential for
    energy production and regulation. The pathway, which has evaded scientists for
    decades, involved relatively simple molecules probably present on early Earth
    that combined at room temperature over months.
