- en: It may come as no surprise that a country as deeply polarized by its recent
    history as Chile is also at war over the relevance of its preëminent poet, Pablo
    Neruda. In December, fifty years after the coup d’état that brought General [Augusto
    Pinochet](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1998/10/19/the-dictator-2) to power,
    Chileans rejected an attempt to write a new constitution to replace the heavily
    amended one adopted by the dictator’s regime. It was the second plebiscite aimed
    at doing so in two years. The first time, in September, 2022, voters rejected
    a left-wing reform in a landslide. In December, a right-wing alternative was also
    soundly rejected, underscoring the extent to which, as the writer and political
    commentator Patricio Fernández told me, “building agreements” has become “extremely
    difficult” in Chile.

  zh: 毫不奇怪，智利这个被近期历史深深分裂的国家，也在围绕其卓越诗人巴勃罗·聂鲁达的相关性上发生争论。去年12月，在推翻萨尔瓦多·阿连德总统领导的政府并将[奥古斯托·皮诺契特](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1998/10/19/the-dictator-2)将军掌权的政变50年后，智利人拒绝了一项旨在取代这位独裁者政权颁布的被大幅修订的宪法的新宪法草案。这是过去两年内第二次试图这样做的全民公投。第一次是在2022年9月，选民们以压倒性的方式否决了左翼改革。12月，右翼的替代方案同样被彻底否决，突显了正如作家兼政治评论员帕特里西奥·费尔南德斯告诉我那样，“达成共识”在智利变得“极其困难”。
- en: Neruda was arguably the most important Spanish-language poet of the twentieth
    century, and a symbol of the Chile that succumbed to Pinochet. He died in September,
    1973, twelve days after the coup overthrew the government of Salvador Allende,
    the democratically elected socialist President and a friend of Neruda’s. For generations,
    Neruda’s prestige seemed beyond reproach. In recent years, however, his life and
    death have been subjected to new scrutiny—and the interpretation and legitimacy
    of his work along with them. But the difficulty in reaching a consensus about
    the poet is the result of efforts coming not from opposing political camps but
    from within the left, to which he historically belonged. One side seeks to portray
    him as a perpetrator, the other as a victim. The former is Chile’s formidable
    feminist movement; the latter is led by the Communist Party—which Neruda was a
    longtime member of and which is now part of the governing coalition—and by some
    of his nephews and nieces, who are determined to prove that the poet was assassinated
    by the dictatorship.

  zh: 聂鲁达可以说是20世纪最重要的西班牙语诗人，也是陷入皮诺契特统治的智利的象征。他于1973年9月去世，就在政变推翻萨尔瓦多·阿连德政府后的12天，而阿连德是民选的社会主义总统，也是聂鲁达的朋友。几代人以来，聂鲁达的威望似乎毫无瑕疵。然而，近年来，他的生平和死亡受到了新的审视，他的作品的解释和合法性也随之而来。但是围绕这位诗人达成共识的困难，不是来自于对立的政治阵营，而是来自于他历史上所属的左翼内部。一方试图将他描绘成加害者，另一方则将他描绘成受害者。前者是智利强大的女权主义运动；后者由共产党领导——聂鲁达长期是该党成员，现在是执政联盟的一部分——以及他的一些侄子侄女们，他们决心证明诗人是被独裁政权暗杀的。
- en: Neruda’s life traversed a good part of the twentieth century, and from early
    on he knew what he was meant to do. He was born Ricardo Eliecer Neftalí Reyes
    Basoalto on July 12, 1904, and grew up in Temuco, in the southern Araucanía region,
    which was known for its magnificent virgin forests and the relentless rainfall
    that he called, in the first pages of his “[Memoirs](https://www.amazon.com/Memoirs-Pablo-Neruda/dp/0374527539),”
    the “one unforgettable presence” of his childhood. His father, a train driver,
    opposed his desire to become a poet and, according to Adam Feinstein, Neruda’s
    biographer, took him on long train rides through the forests, in an effort to
    distract his son from writing. Those rides, however, only fuelled a love of nature,
    which shaped much of Neruda’s work. He became a published writer at thirteen,
    when a local newspaper printed a short essay in which he argued that “enthusiasm
    and perseverance” are the engines of progress. At the age of sixteen, to hide
    his identity from his father—and possibly in homage to the Czech realist writer
    and poet Jan Neruda—he adopted the pen name Pablo Neruda. His first book of poems,
    “[Crepusculario](https://www.amazon.com/Book-Twilight-Pablo-Neruda/dp/1556593988)”
    (“Book of Twilight”), was published three years later. A month shy of turning
    twenty, he released “[Veinte Poemas de Amor y una Canción Desesperada](https://www.amazon.com/Twenty-Love-Poems-Song-Despair/dp/0811803201)”
    (“Twenty Love Poems and a Song of Despair”), about the heartbreak of falling in
    love, which remains one of the most iconic books of poems in Spanish.

  zh: Neruda的一生几乎跨越了整个二十世纪，从早年起他就知道自己的使命。1904年7月12日，他出生在特木科，在南部阿劳卡尼亚地区长大，这里以其壮丽的原始森林和他称之为童年中“难忘存在”的不间断降雨而闻名，这些都在他的《[回忆录](https://www.amazon.com/Memoirs-Pablo-Neruda/dp/0374527539)》的开篇中有所体现。他的父亲是一名火车司机，反对他成为诗人的愿望，并根据亚当·费因斯坦，尼鲁达的传记作者所述，经常带他乘坐火车穿越森林，试图转移他儿子写作的注意力。然而，这些车程只加深了他对自然的热爱，这也成为尼鲁达作品的重要主题之一。他在十三岁时成为一名发表的作家，当地一家报纸刊登了他的一篇短文，他在文中辩称，“热情和毅力”是进步的动力。十六岁时，为了隐藏自己的身份不让父亲发现，或许也是向捷克现实主义作家和诗人扬·尼鲁达致敬，他采用了笔名巴勃罗·尼鲁达。三年后，他出版了他的第一本诗集《[暮色](https://www.amazon.com/Book-Twilight-Pablo-Neruda/dp/1556593988)》，一月之后他迎来了二十岁生日，《[爱的二十首诗和一首绝望的歌](https://www.amazon.com/Twenty-Love-Poems-Song-Despair/dp/0811803201)》出版，讲述了恋爱的痛苦，至今仍然是西班牙诗歌中最具代表性的书籍之一。

    A month later, his friend [Federico García Lorca](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2009/06/22/lorcas-bones)
    was executed by a Nationalist firing squad. For the first time, Neruda’s work
    became politically engaged, and in 1937 he published “[España en el Corazón](https://www.amazon.com/Hearts-Espana-corazon-Directions-Bibelots/dp/081121642X)”
    (“Spain in Our Hearts”), an antifascist hymn. He returned to Santiago, but when
    the republic fell, in 1939, he was sent to Paris, where he led the evacuation
    of more than two thousand Spanish refugees to Chile on the Winnipeg, a French
    cargo ship that had to be refitted; he later called the mission his most enduring
    poem. After a stint as consul in Mexico, he returned to Chile, where, in 1945,
    he was elected to the Senate and officially joined the Communist Party. A couple
    of years later, at the onset of the Cold War, the government of President Gabriel
    González Videla, which had been elected with Communist support, shifted to the
    right and initiated a crackdown on workers and Party members. After Neruda condemned
    González Videla on the Senate floor, he was accused of treason and an order was
    issued for his arrest. Neruda went into hiding until, a year later, he left the
    country, crossing the Andes on horseback to Argentina, and then went into exile
    in Europe.

    in Our Hearts"），一首反法西斯主义的颂歌。他回到了圣地亚哥，但是1939年共和国倒台时，他被派往巴黎，在那里他率领超过两千名西班牙难民乘坐重新改装的法国货船“温尼伯号”返回智利；他后来称这次任务是他最持久的诗篇。在担任墨西哥领事后，他回到了智利，在1945年当选为参议员，并正式加入了共产党。几年后，在冷战初期，总统加布里埃尔·冈萨雷斯·维德拉领导的政府，尽管当初得到了共产党的支持，却向右转变并开始镇压工人和党员。聂鲁达在参议院上谴责冈萨雷斯·维德拉后，被指控叛国，并下令逮捕。聂鲁达隐匿起来，一年后骑马越过安第斯山进入阿根廷，并流亡欧洲。
