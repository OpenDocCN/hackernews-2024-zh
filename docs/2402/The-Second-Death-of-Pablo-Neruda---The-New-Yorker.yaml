- en: It may come as no surprise that a country as deeply polarized by its recent
    history as Chile is also at war over the relevance of its preëminent poet, Pablo
    Neruda. In December, fifty years after the coup d’état that brought General [Augusto
    Pinochet](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1998/10/19/the-dictator-2) to power,
    Chileans rejected an attempt to write a new constitution to replace the heavily
    amended one adopted by the dictator’s regime. It was the second plebiscite aimed
    at doing so in two years. The first time, in September, 2022, voters rejected
    a left-wing reform in a landslide. In December, a right-wing alternative was also
    soundly rejected, underscoring the extent to which, as the writer and political
    commentator Patricio Fernández told me, “building agreements” has become “extremely
    difficult” in Chile.

- en: Neruda was arguably the most important Spanish-language poet of the twentieth
    century, and a symbol of the Chile that succumbed to Pinochet. He died in September,
    1973, twelve days after the coup overthrew the government of Salvador Allende,
    the democratically elected socialist President and a friend of Neruda’s. For generations,
    Neruda’s prestige seemed beyond reproach. In recent years, however, his life and
    death have been subjected to new scrutiny—and the interpretation and legitimacy
    of his work along with them. But the difficulty in reaching a consensus about
    the poet is the result of efforts coming not from opposing political camps but
    from within the left, to which he historically belonged. One side seeks to portray
    him as a perpetrator, the other as a victim. The former is Chile’s formidable
    feminist movement; the latter is led by the Communist Party—which Neruda was a
    longtime member of and which is now part of the governing coalition—and by some
    of his nephews and nieces, who are determined to prove that the poet was assassinated
    by the dictatorship.

    on he knew what he was meant to do. He was born Ricardo Eliecer Neftalí Reyes
    Basoalto on July 12, 1904, and grew up in Temuco, in the southern Araucanía region,
    which was known for its magnificent virgin forests and the relentless rainfall
    that he called, in the first pages of his “[Memoirs](https://www.amazon.com/Memoirs-Pablo-Neruda/dp/0374527539),”
    the “one unforgettable presence” of his childhood. His father, a train driver,
    opposed his desire to become a poet and, according to Adam Feinstein, Neruda’s
    biographer, took him on long train rides through the forests, in an effort to
    distract his son from writing. Those rides, however, only fuelled a love of nature,
    which shaped much of Neruda’s work. He became a published writer at thirteen,
    when a local newspaper printed a short essay in which he argued that “enthusiasm
    and perseverance” are the engines of progress. At the age of sixteen, to hide
    his identity from his father—and possibly in homage to the Czech realist writer
    and poet Jan Neruda—he adopted the pen name Pablo Neruda. His first book of poems,
    “[Crepusculario](https://www.amazon.com/Book-Twilight-Pablo-Neruda/dp/1556593988)”
    (“Book of Twilight”), was published three years later. A month shy of turning
    twenty, he released “[Veinte Poemas de Amor y una Canción Desesperada](https://www.amazon.com/Twenty-Love-Poems-Song-Despair/dp/0811803201)”
    (“Twenty Love Poems and a Song of Despair”), about the heartbreak of falling in
    love, which remains one of the most iconic books of poems in Spanish.

    casual repetitions, their over-all simplicity mark Neruda’s early style and account
    in some measure for the continued popularity of the book,” Mark Strand, the former
    U.S. Poet Laureate, [wrote in this magazine](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2003/09/08/the-ecstasist),

    but soon devoted himself to writing. His initial literary success brought him
    “a small aura of respectability,” he later wrote in “Memoirs,” and in 1927 he
    used it to get an appointment, through a well-connected friend, with the Minister
    of Foreign Affairs, who offered him a position as consul in colonial Burma.

    Tierra](https://www.amazon.com/Residence-Earth-Pablo-Neruda/dp/0811215814)” (“Residence
    on Earth”), a collection of Surrealist poems, some about the Chilean landscape,
    that he wrote, in part, during his years spent abroad as consul. After Burma,
    he was sent to Colombo, then to Java—where, in 1930, at the age of twenty-six,
    he married María Antonia Hagenaar, known as Maruca, with whom he had his only
    child, Malva Marina—and later to Singapore, Buenos Aires, Barcelona, and Madrid.
    Feinstein described the collection as “hard to understand because of its obscure
    imagery, its hermetic richness,” but noted that it contains “some of the most
    beautiful poetry ever written in Spanish.” From “Walking Around”:'

    A month later, his friend [Federico García Lorca](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2009/06/22/lorcas-bones)
    was executed by a Nationalist firing squad. For the first time, Neruda’s work
    became politically engaged, and in 1937 he published “[España en el Corazón](https://www.amazon.com/Hearts-Espana-corazon-Directions-Bibelots/dp/081121642X)”
    (“Spain in Our Hearts”), an antifascist hymn. He returned to Santiago, but when
    the republic fell, in 1939, he was sent to Paris, where he led the evacuation
    of more than two thousand Spanish refugees to Chile on the Winnipeg, a French
    cargo ship that had to be refitted; he later called the mission his most enduring
    poem. After a stint as consul in Mexico, he returned to Chile, where, in 1945,
    he was elected to the Senate and officially joined the Communist Party. A couple
    of years later, at the onset of the Cold War, the government of President Gabriel
    González Videla, which had been elected with Communist support, shifted to the
    right and initiated a crackdown on workers and Party members. After Neruda condemned
    González Videla on the Senate floor, he was accused of treason and an order was
    issued for his arrest. Neruda went into hiding until, a year later, he left the
    country, crossing the Andes on horseback to Argentina, and then went into exile
    in Europe.
