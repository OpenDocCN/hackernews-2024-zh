    right away. This means we make decisions near the leaves before we tackle higher
    level decisions. Halfway through the development work (i.e. when significant amounts
    of code has been written already), we may have a design tree that looks like this:'

- en: What product does that correspond to? None at all. These decisions are on completely
    different branches, meaning they are mutually exclusive, and there is no way to
    construct a product that satisfies them all. We generally don’t notice this until
    someone forces us to make a decision on e.g. question *b*, and then we realise
    that whatever we choose, we are locking ourselves out of either *k* or *g*.

- en: The silver lining on the dark clouds is that this is usually discovered rather
    late in the development process, so at this point the stakeholders may actually
    be receptive to throwing out most of the decisions we had agreed to in order to
    make the project finish sooner. It is a little embarrassing none the less.

    like this:'

    much rather make the choice that unlocks *c* as an alternative. Unfortunately,
    that’s incompatible with all decisions we’ve made so far.

- en: 'This is a devious situation that occurs surprisingly often: our early leaf-near
    decisions imply a set of higher level decisions that we disagree with. Again,
    we usually don’t discover this until we are trying to integrate everything and
    get it out the door. Result: lots of expensive rework, or settling for a suboptimal
    solution.'

- en: 'This is another reason to focus on high-level decisions first: we lower the
    risk of spending time on decisions that we’ll have to tear up later because they
    are incompatible with the overall shape we want the product to have.'
