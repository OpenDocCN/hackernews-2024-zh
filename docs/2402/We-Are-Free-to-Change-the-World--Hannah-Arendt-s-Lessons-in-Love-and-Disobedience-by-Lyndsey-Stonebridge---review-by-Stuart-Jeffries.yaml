    dock inside a Jerusalem courtroom in 1961, she saw something different from everybody
    else. The prosecution, writes Lyndsey Stonebridge, ‘saw an ancient crime in modern
    garb, and portrayed Eichmann as the latest monster in the long history of anti-Semitism
    who had simply used novel methods to take hatred for Jews to a new level’. Arendt
    thought otherwise.

  zh: 当汉娜·阿伦特在1961年在耶路撒冷法庭的防弹玻璃舱内看着穿着不合身西装的男人时，她看到了与所有其他人不同的东西。林赛·斯通布里奇写道，起诉方‘在这位被告身上看到了一种现代外衣下的古老罪行，并将艾希曼描绘成了长期反犹太主义历史上最新的怪物，他只是用新颖的方法将对犹太人的仇恨推向了一个新的水平’。但阿伦特则持其他观点。
- en: 'Adolf Eichmann was on trial after being captured by Israeli agents in Argentina
    and brought to Israel to face charges of being a leading organiser of the Holocaust.
    Arendt was there to report on the trial for the *New Yorker*. The commission would
    lead to Arendt’s most famous book, *Eichmann in Jerusalem* (1963). Arendt was
    the ideal woman for the job: she was not just a Jewish refugee who had fled Hitler
    in 1933, and a philosopher who had studied with and loved the one-time Nazi Martin
    Heidegger, but also someone who had reinvented herself in America as a journalist
    and political theorist, and the author of *The Origins of Totalitarianism*, about
    the rise of Nazism and Stalinism. She was, if anything, overqualified.'

  zh: 阿道夫·艾希曼被以色列特工在阿根廷抓获，并被带到以色列接受指控，指控他是大屠杀的头号组织者。阿伦特在那里为《纽约客》报道审判。这项任务将成为阿伦特最著名的著作《耶路撒冷的艾希曼》（1963年）。阿伦特是最适合这项工作的女性：她不仅是1933年逃离希特勒的犹太难民，曾师从并对一度是纳粹的马丁·海德格尔投以爱慕之情的哲学家，还是一个已在美国以新闻记者和政治理论家身份重塑自我，并是关于纳粹主义和斯大林主义崛起的著作《极权主义的起源》的作者。如果可以说的话，她是过度合格的。
- en: 'But what did Arendt see in Eichmann? Stonebridge tells us that Arendt put on
    dark glasses in court to shield her eyes, not from the former SS-Obersturmbannführer’s
    diabolical aura but rather from the TV lights: this was a media event without
    precedent, beamed live across the world. Eichmann was a mass murderer deludedly
    vain enough to boast to a court teeming with Holocaust survivors that he had insisted
    on limiting the number of persons per cattle truck because the conditions were
    so inhumane. Arendt, relates Stonebridge, was dumbfounded at Eichmann’s ‘lack
    of moral, social, historical, of *human* awareness’.'

  zh: 那么，阿伦特看到的艾希曼是什么样的人？斯通布里奇告诉我们，阿伦特在法庭上戴上暗色眼镜，不是为了避开前国家社会党军团上校的邪恶光环，而是为了避开电视灯光：这是一个前所未有的媒体盛事，通过全球实时传输。艾希曼是一个自大到足以向满是大屠杀幸存者的法庭夸口说他坚持限制每辆车的人数，因为情况太不人道了的大屠杀者。斯通布里奇揭示，阿伦特对于艾希曼‘缺乏道德、社会、历史、*人类*意识’感到惊讶。
- en: 'Arendt wrote: ‘The longer one listened to him, the more it became obvious that
    his inability to speak was closely connected to his inability to think, namely
    to think from the standpoint of somebody else.’ When Arendt wrote of the banality
    of evil, the phrase that of all the millions of words she wrote has survived her
    death in 1975, it was this deficiency she was indicting. ‘Eichmann was not stupid,
    but rather intelligent,’ she told the historian Joachim Fest. ‘But it was his
    thickheadedness that was so outrageous, as if speaking to a brick wall. And that
    was what I actually meant by banality … There’s simply resistance ever to imagine
    what another person is experiencing.’'

  zh: 阿伦特写道：‘越是听他说话，越显而易见的是，他的无法言说与他无法思考有着密切的联系，也就是说无法从别人的立场去思考。’当阿伦特谈到了‘邪恶的平庸’这个短语，这是她一生写下的数百万字中唯一被保存下来，并在她1975年去世后，这个短语被广为传颂。她指责的正是这种缺陷。她对历史学家约阿希姆·费斯特说：‘艾希曼并不愚蠢，而是相当聪明。但是他的顽固愚昧令人发指，就像在对墙壁说话一样。这才是我所谓的平庸……根本就对另一个人的经历抱有抵抗情绪。’
- en: Stonebridge, professor of humanities and human rights at the University of Birmingham,
    has written a sometimes infuriating yet often scintillating and always bracing
    book. It is in part a biography and in part a meditation on what, if anything,
    the long-dead philosopher has to say to us today. Stonebridge takes inspiration
    from the fact that when Donald Trump became president in 2016, Arendt’s *The Origins
    of Totalitarianism* got a sales bump. Clearly some thought Arendt’s dissection
    of Nazism could help us understand 21st-century populism’s leading monster.

  zh: 斯通布里奇（Stonebridge），伯明翰大学人文学和人权教授，写了一本有时令人愤怒但常常耀眼且总是振奋人心的书。这本书在某种程度上是一部传记，同时也是关于那位早已去世哲学家今天是否对我们有所启发的冥想。斯通布里奇受到启发，因为当唐纳德·特朗普在2016年成为总统时，阿伦特的《极权主义的起源》销量激增。显然，一些人认为阿伦特对纳粹的解剖有助于我们理解21世纪民粹主义的领导怪物。
- en: 'Moreover, this is a book in which Stonebridge conducts a bold literary experiment.
    When she writes about what Arendt saw in Eichmann, she does something extraordinary
    – and in keeping with her heroine’s political philosophy. She puts herself in
    Arendt’s place and imagines how she, Stonebridge, might have regarded that putatively
    banal devil. Stonebridge claims justification for her method by citing how Arendt
    was committed to what Immanuel Kant called ‘an enlarged mentality’. Arendt told
    her students at New York’s New School in 1968 what that meant: ‘You think your
    own thoughts but in the place of somebody else.’ An enlarged mentality, though,
    is not the same as empathy, which involves sharing the feelings of another. Arendt
    didn’t do empathy. Indeed for her, just as for Kant, feelings could get in the
    way of proper moral judgement. Arendt was raised in the German city of Königsberg
    (now called Kaliningrad and part of Russia), where Kant had lived and taught.
    She read his *Critique of* *Pure Reason* at sixteen and emerges from Stonebridge’s
    pages as more marked by Kantian thought on how we should act than by anything
    she learned in Heidegger’s lectures or bed.'

  zh: 此外，这是一本斯通布里奇进行大胆文学实验的书。当她写到阿伦特在艾希曼身上看到的东西时，她做了一些非凡的事情——并与她的女英雄政治哲学保持一致。她把自己放在阿伦特的位置上，并想象她，斯通布里奇，可能如何看待那个据说平淡无奇的魔鬼。斯通布里奇引用阿伦特的方法来证明她的正当性，因为阿伦特致力于伊曼纽尔·康德所谓的“扩展的心态”。阿伦特在1968年告诉她在纽约新学派的学生们这意味着什么：“你用他人的角度思考你自己的想法。”然而，扩展的心态并不等同于同情，后者涉及分享另一个人的感受。阿伦特并不做同情。确实，对她来说，正如对康德来说，感情可能妨碍正确的道德判断。阿伦特在德国的康斯贝格（现在称为卡里宁格勒，是俄罗斯的一部分）长大，在那里康德曾生活和教学。她十六岁时读了他的《纯粹理性批判》，并在斯通布里奇的书页上出现，更多地受到康德关于我们应该如何行动的思想影响，而不是任何她在海德格尔的讲座或床上学到的东西。
- en: 'For me, at least, Stonebridge’s approach produced confusion. Sometimes I couldn’t
    be certain that I wasn’t reading a novelettish passage of poetic licence rather
    than about what actually happened. For instance, Stonebridge writes: ‘On 4 October
    1957 … Hannah Arendt looked up at the night sky from her window on the Upper West
    Side and wondered whether she would catch a glimpse of Sputnik, the first satellite
    to orbit the earth.’ Did she? Or is this Stonebridge’s enlarged mentality journeying
    where other biographers would not dare to go? She describes Kant walking through
    Königsberg, thinking ‘crossly’ about why it was *Vernunft* (‘reason’) rather than
    *Verstand* (‘understanding’) that conferred freedom on humans. I’m sure Kant was
    thinking, but did he think *crossly*?'

  zh: 对我来说，至少斯通布里奇的方法带来了混淆。有时候我无法确定自己是否在读一段充满诗意许可的小说化的文字，而不是实际发生的事情。例如，斯通布里奇写道：“1957年10月4日……汉娜·阿伦特从她在上西区的窗户上望向夜空，想知道她是否能瞥见斯普特尼克，第一颗绕地球运行的卫星。”她看到了吗？还是这是斯通布里奇的扩展的心态，探索其他传记作者不敢涉足的领域？她描述康德在康斯贝格漫步时“板着脸地”想着为什么是“理性”而不是“理解”赋予人类自由。我确信康德在思考，但他是否“板着脸”思考呢？
- en: 'This notion of an enlarged mentality is key to how Arendt approached real-life
    political problems, often with disastrous consequences. Consider Arendt’s take
    on what happened in Little Rock, Arkansas, on the morning of 3 September 1957\.
    Elizabeth Eckford was surrounded by a mob of white youths screaming that they
    wanted to lynch her as she walked to school. The fifteen-year-old African-American
    was one of the Little Rock Nine, a group of students fighting for their constitutional
    rights following the 1954 Supreme Court ruling effectively outlawing racial segregation
    in schools. Arendt’s perspective on this incident was, to put it mildly, obtuse.
    ‘Have we now come to the point where it is the children who are being asked to
    change the world?’ she asked. ‘And do we intend our political battles to be fought
    out in the school yards?’ Had Arendt asked the nine, their parents or any of the
    African-Americans who fought for civil rights, they might have told her the answer
    to both questions was ‘yes’. Arendt thought otherwise: ‘My first question was,
    what would you do if you were a Negro mother? … The answer: under no conditions
    would I expose my child to conditions which made it appear as though it wanted
    to push its way into a group where it was not wanted.’'

  zh: 这种“开阔心态”的概念是阿伦特处理现实政治问题的关键，但往往带来灾难性后果。考虑一下阿肯色州小石城的1957年9月3日早晨发生的事情。伊丽莎白·艾克福德在上学路上被一群白人青年包围，他们尖叫着要绞死她。这位十五岁的非裔美国人是“小石城九勇士”之一，这群学生在1954年最高法院判决实质性取消学校种族隔离后，为捍卫他们的宪法权利而战。阿伦特对这一事件的看法，委婉地说，是迟钝的。“我们现在已经到了孩子们被要求改变世界的地步吗？”她问道。“我们打算把我们的政治斗争在校园里进行吗？”如果阿伦特问过这九位学生，他们的父母或任何为民权而战的非裔美国人，他们可能会告诉她两个问题的答案都是“是”。阿伦特的看法则不同：“我的第一个问题是，如果你是一个黑人母亲，你会怎么做？...答案是：无论如何我都不会让我的孩子置身于那些让它看起来像是要硬闯一个不欢迎它的团体的条件下。”
- en: Her short-sightedness on this undermines Stonebridge’s insistence that Arendt
    is valuable to us now because she helps us think like a refugee, that her outsider’s
    queering perspective might yield ethical and political insights. To her credit,
    Arendt later admitted that she should have known better, writing to the great
    African-American novelist Ralph Ellison a decade on, ‘It is precisely the “ideal
    of sacrifice” which I didn’t understand and … this failure to understand caused
    me indeed to go in an entirely wrong direction.’

  zh: 她在这个问题上的短视使得斯通布里奇坚持认为阿伦特对我们有价值，因为她帮助我们像难民一样思考，她作为局外人的另类视角可能会产生伦理和政治上的洞见，这种观点受到了质疑。值得肯定的是，阿伦特后来承认她本应了解得更多，十年后给伟大的非裔美国小说家拉尔夫·艾利森写道：“恰恰是‘牺牲的理想’我没理解，而...这种不理解实际上导致我完全走错了方向。”
- en: But the point for me in this passage is not that it shows how a white German-Jewish
    refugee couldn’t grasp a black American girl’s struggle (Arendt could have done
    if she’d tried harder and thought better), but rather how her notion of ‘enlarged
    mentality’ has its shortcomings. If you put yourself in someone else’s shoes but
    don’t take the extra step of sharing their feelings or comprehending their struggle,
    then politically your stance risks being not just jejune but counterproductive.

  zh: 但对我而言，这段文字的重点并不在于展示一个白种德裔犹太难民无法理解一个黑人美国女孩的斗争（如果阿伦特更加努力并且思考更加深刻，她本可以做到的），而是她所谓的“开阔心态”存在其局限性。如果你站在别人的立场上，却没有进一步分享他们的感受或理解他们的斗争，那么从政治上讲，你的立场不仅可能显得幼稚而且可能适得其反。
- en: Are we free to change the world, as the book’s title suggests? To answer the
    question, we need to go back to that Jerusalem courtroom. At one point during
    the trial, Eichmann invoked duty, as if to say that mass-murdering Jews was okay
    because his bosses told him to do it. If Eichmann had read Kant, as he claimed
    he had, he clearly hadn’t understood him. ‘Kant’s whole ethics amounts to the
    idea that every person, in every action, must reflect on whether the maxim of
    his action can become a universal law,’ Arendt wrote in *On Humanity in* *Dark
    Times*. ‘In other words … it really is the complete opposite, so to speak, of
    obedience … In Kant, nobody has the right to obey.’

  zh: 我们是否有权改变世界，正如书名所示？要回答这个问题，我们需要回到耶路撒冷的法庭。在审判期间的某个时刻，艾希曼援引了责任，仿佛在说大规模屠杀犹太人是可以的，因为他的老板告诉他这么做。“如果艾希曼读过康德，就像他声称他曾经读过的那样，他显然没有理解他。”阿伦特在《黑暗时代中的人性》中写道，“康德的整个伦理学观念是每个人在每个行动中都必须考虑自己行动的最大化是否能成为普世法则的想法。换句话说...这实际上是完全相反，可以说是服从的完全相反。在康德看来，没有人有权服从。”
- en: 'Across the decades, that sentence resounds: ‘nobody has the right to obey’.
    Not Eichmann, not anyone blaming others for their own failings. We are free only
    to the extent that we are capable of disobeying. Kant discovered, Stonebridge
    tells us, that it is only because we can think (which seems to boil down to reasoning
    about what we ought to do) that human freedom and dignity are possible.'

  zh: 数十年来，这句话回响不息：“没有人有权服从”。不论是艾希曼，还是任何将责任推给他人的人。我们只有在能够违抗的程度上才是自由的。斯通布里奇告诉我们，康德发现，仅仅因为我们能够思考（这似乎归结为思考我们应该做什么），人类的自由和尊严才成为可能。
- en: 'Arendt did a lot thinking, some of it solitary, some of it with others, and
    a great deal of it in writings that, like the Little Rock essay, needed another
    draft. Her thinking is sometimes exasperatingly mutable. The critic Martin Jay
    called Arendt’s political theory a ‘force field’ rather than a set of doctrines.
    But that makes sense if you see philosophy in the way that two of the most important
    men in her life did. Her friend Karl Jaspers thought that the world’s philosophical
    systems were mythological structures devised to shelter ourselves from the hard
    facts of existence. Heidegger, similarly, supposed that philosophy was the ‘narcotization
    of anxiety’. Arendt emerges from this book as valuable precisely because she stepped
    away from philosophy’s patriarchal strictures and grand systems: she didn’t shelter
    from existence or narcotise anxiety. She philosophised not as men had but as a
    woman could.'

  zh: Arendt 从未停止思考，有时独自思考，有时与他人讨论，大部分时间则是在需要另一次修改的著作中。她的思考有时令人懊恼地多变。评论家马丁·杰伊称阿伦特的政治理论为“力场”，而非一套教条。但如果你像她生命中两位最重要的男人那样看待哲学，这一点就说得通了。她的朋友卡尔·亚斯珀斯认为，世界的哲学体系是一种神话结构，旨在遮蔽我们面对存在的严峻事实。同样，海德格尔认为哲学是“对焦虑的麻醉”。阿伦特从这本书中显现出色，正是因为她远离了哲学的家长式规范和宏大体系：她不是避开存在或麻醉焦虑。她哲学思辨的方式不同于男性，而是作为一个女性所能做到的。
- en: 'What Arendt wrote about the 18th-century philosopher and dramatist Gotthold
    Ephraim Lessing is true of her: ‘Instead of fixing his identity in history with
    a perfectly consistent system, he scattered into the world, as he himself knew,
    “nothing but *fermenta cognitionis*”.’ Stonebridge’s book is essential reading
    because she hurls us deeper into Arendt’s ferment of thinking than previous interpreters
    have dared to, taking the risk of showing us that there was muddle rather than
    method at the heart of it.'

    斯通布里奇的书是必读之作，因为她将我们深入到阿伦特思想的发酵中去，比之前的解读者更敢于冒险，冒险地向我们展示，在其核心并非方法而是混乱。

    another book in that bastard subgenre that involves violating a philosopher’s
    reputation by converting their thinking into a self-help manual (you know the
    drill: how Nietzsche can get you a pay rise; how Judith Butler can help you become
    your best self; how Iris Murdoch can improve your sex life). If so, happily Stonebridge
