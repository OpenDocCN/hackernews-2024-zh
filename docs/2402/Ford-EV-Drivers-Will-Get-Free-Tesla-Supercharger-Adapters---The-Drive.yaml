    we'd send customers a Fast Charging Adapter. I'm pleased to confirm that eligible
    Mustang Mach-E & F-150 Lightning owners in the U.S. + Canada can reserve a complimentary
    adapter starting soon,” [Farley says via X, formerly Twitter](https://twitter.com/jimfarley98/status/1752708081824247808).

- en: Currently, Ford EVs are built with a Combined Charging System 1 (CCS1) inlet.
    Ford’s plan is to offer access to the Supercharger network to its customers through
    2024 via an adapter, then build native ports into their EVs starting next year
    that don’t require the extra part. Ford EV customers can already charge up at
    10,000 public DC fast chargers as part of the company’s 84,000-plus BlueOval Charge
    Network. The Tesla agreement adds 12,000 Superchargers to the mix across the US
    and Canada, and Ford says it’s adding about 1,800 public fast chargers to the
    network this year.

    adopt NACS on their EVs starting in 2025\. New Hyundai, Kia, and Genesis models
    are expected to be equipped with a NACS port this year. It would be ideal if all
    EVs used the same port standard so that charging is as easy and predictable as
    plugging in an appliance at home, even when you're out and about.
