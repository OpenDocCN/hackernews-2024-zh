- en: Hello everyone. It is my pleasure to bring you the greatest house I have ever
    seen. The house of a true visionary. A real ad-hocist. A genuine pioneer of fenestration.
    This house is in Alabama. It was built in 1980 and costs around $5 million. It
    is worth every penny. Perhaps more.

    certainly it’s not McMansion Heaven. This is very much a house in the earthly
    realm. Purgatory. McMansion Purgatory.” Well, let me now play Beatrice to your
    Dante, young Pilgrim. Welcome. Welcome, welcome, welcome.'

- en: It is rare to find a house that has everything. A house that wills itself into
    Postmodernism yet remains unable to let go of the kookiest moments of the prior
    zeitgeist, the Bruce Goffs and Earthships, the commune houses built from car windshields,
    the seventies moments of psychedelic hippie fracture. It is everything. It has
    everything. It is theme park, it is High Tech. It is Renaissance (in the San Antonio
    Riverwalk sense of the word.) It is medieval. It is maybe the greatest pastiche
    to sucker itself to the side of a mountain, perilously overlooking a large body
    of water. Look at it. Just look.

    because this is McMansion Heaven and Gray is for McMansion Hell. There is an overbearing
    sheen of 80s optimism. In this house, the credit default swap has not yet been
    invented, but could be.

- en: It takes a lot for me to drop the cocaine word because I think it’s a cheap
    joke. But there’s something about this example that makes it plausible, not in
    a derogatory way, but in a liberatory one, a sensuous one. Someone created this
    house to have a particular experience, a particular feeling. It possesses an element
    of true fantasy, the thematic. Its rooms are not meant to be one cohesive composition,
    but rather a series of scenes, of vastly different spatial moments, compressed,
    expanded, bright, close.

    interior design tries to hide, namely how unceasingly peculiar the house is, it
    is not entirely able to because the choices made here remain decadent, indulgent,
    albeit in a more familiar way.

- en: Rare is it to discover an interior wherein one truly must wear sunglasses. The
    environment created in service to transparency has to somewhat prevent the elements
    from penetrating too deep while retaining their desirable qualities. I don’t think
    an architect designed this house. An architect would have had access to specifically
    engineered products for this purpose. Whoever built this house had certain access
    to architectural catalogues but not those used in the highest end or most structurally
    complex projects. The customization here lies in the assemblage of materials and
    in doing so stretches them to the height of their imaginative capacity. To borrow
    from Charles Jencks, ad-hoc is a perfect description. It is an architecture of
    availability and of adventure.

- en: A small interlude. We are outside. There is no rear exterior view of this house
    because it would be impossible to get one from the scrawny lawn that lies at its
    depths. This space is intended to serve the same purpose, which is to look upon
    the house itself as much as gaze from the house to the world beyond.

- en: Living in a city, I often think about exhibitionism. Living in a city is inherently
    exhibitionist. A house is a permeable visible surface; it is entirely possible
    that someone will catch a glimpse of me they’re not supposed to when I rush to
    the living room in only a t-shirt to turn out the light before bed. But this is
    a space that is only exhibitionist in the sense that it is an architecture of
    exposure, and yet this exposure would not be possible without the protection of
    the site, of the distance from every other pair of eyes. In this respect, a double
    freedom is secured. The window intimates the potential of seeing. But no one sees.

- en: At the heart of this house lies a strange mix of concepts. Postmodern classicist
    columns of the Disney World set. The unpolished edge of the vernacular. There
    is also an organicist bent to the whole thing, something more Goff than Gaudí,
    and here we see some of the house’s most organic forms, the monolith- or shell-like
    vanity mixed with the luminous artifice of mirrors and white. A backlit cave,
    primitive and performative at the same time, which is, in essence, the dialectic
    of the luxury bathroom.

- en: And yet our McMansion Heaven is still a McMansion. It is still an accumulation
    of deliberate signifiers of wealth, very much a construction with the secondary
    purpose of invoking envy, a palatial residence designed without much cohesion.
    The presence of golf, of wood, of masculine and patriarchal symbolism with an
    undercurrent of luxury drives that point home. The McMansion can aspire to an
    art form, but there are still many levels to ascend before one gets to where God’s
    sitting.
