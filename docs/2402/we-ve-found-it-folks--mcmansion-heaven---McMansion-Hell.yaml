- en: Hello everyone. It is my pleasure to bring you the greatest house I have ever
    seen. The house of a true visionary. A real ad-hocist. A genuine pioneer of fenestration.
    This house is in Alabama. It was built in 1980 and costs around $5 million. It
    is worth every penny. Perhaps more.

    certainly it’s not McMansion Heaven. This is very much a house in the earthly
    realm. Purgatory. McMansion Purgatory.” Well, let me now play Beatrice to your
    Dante, young Pilgrim. Welcome. Welcome, welcome, welcome.'

- en: It is rare to find a house that has everything. A house that wills itself into
    Postmodernism yet remains unable to let go of the kookiest moments of the prior
    zeitgeist, the Bruce Goffs and Earthships, the commune houses built from car windshields,
    the seventies moments of psychedelic hippie fracture. It is everything. It has
    everything. It is theme park, it is High Tech. It is Renaissance (in the San Antonio
    Riverwalk sense of the word.) It is medieval. It is maybe the greatest pastiche
    to sucker itself to the side of a mountain, perilously overlooking a large body
    of water. Look at it. Just look.

    because this is McMansion Heaven and Gray is for McMansion Hell. There is an overbearing
    sheen of 80s optimism. In this house, the credit default swap has not yet been
    invented, but could be.

- en: It takes a lot for me to drop the cocaine word because I think it’s a cheap
    joke. But there’s something about this example that makes it plausible, not in
    a derogatory way, but in a liberatory one, a sensuous one. Someone created this
    house to have a particular experience, a particular feeling. It possesses an element
    of true fantasy, the thematic. Its rooms are not meant to be one cohesive composition,
    but rather a series of scenes, of vastly different spatial moments, compressed,
    expanded, bright, close.

    interior design tries to hide, namely how unceasingly peculiar the house is, it
    is not entirely able to because the choices made here remain decadent, indulgent,
    albeit in a more familiar way.

- en: Rare is it to discover an interior wherein one truly must wear sunglasses. The
    environment created in service to transparency has to somewhat prevent the elements
    from penetrating too deep while retaining their desirable qualities. I don’t think
    an architect designed this house. An architect would have had access to specifically
    engineered products for this purpose. Whoever built this house had certain access
    to architectural catalogues but not those used in the highest end or most structurally
    complex projects. The customization here lies in the assemblage of materials and
    in doing so stretches them to the height of their imaginative capacity. To borrow
    from Charles Jencks, ad-hoc is a perfect description. It is an architecture of
    availability and of adventure.

  zh: 很少有内部环境让人真正需要戴墨镜。为了服务透明度而创造的环境必须在某种程度上阻止元素过深渗透，同时保留它们的可取之处。我不认为有建筑师设计了这座房子。建筑师本应该能够获得专门为此目的设计的产品。建造这座房子的人可以访问建筑目录，但并非那些用于最高端或结构最复杂的项目。这里的定制性体现在材料的组合上，并通过这种方式将它们延伸到想象力的极限。借用查尔斯·詹克斯（Charles
    Jencks）的话来说，临时性是一个完美的描述。这是一种可得性和冒险的建筑。
- en: A small interlude. We are outside. There is no rear exterior view of this house
    because it would be impossible to get one from the scrawny lawn that lies at its
    depths. This space is intended to serve the same purpose, which is to look upon
    the house itself as much as gaze from the house to the world beyond.

  zh: 一个小插曲。我们在外面。这座房子的后部没有外部景观，因为从其深处的瘦小草坪上获取一个外部视角是不可能的。这个空间的意图是为了达到同样的目的，即看向房子本身，正如从房子向外界眺望一样。
- en: Living in a city, I often think about exhibitionism. Living in a city is inherently
    exhibitionist. A house is a permeable visible surface; it is entirely possible
    that someone will catch a glimpse of me they’re not supposed to when I rush to
    the living room in only a t-shirt to turn out the light before bed. But this is
    a space that is only exhibitionist in the sense that it is an architecture of
    exposure, and yet this exposure would not be possible without the protection of
    the site, of the distance from every other pair of eyes. In this respect, a double
    freedom is secured. The window intimates the potential of seeing. But no one sees.

  zh: 生活在城市中，我常常思考展示主义。生活在城市中本质上是展示主义的。房子是一种可透视的可见表面；当我穿着T恤赶去客厅关灯睡觉时，完全有可能被某人看到他们不该看到的一瞥。但这个空间只在一种暴露的意义上是展示主义，然而这种暴露不可能没有站点的保护，没有与每一双眼睛的距离。在这方面，双重自由得以确保。窗户暗示了可能看到的可能性。但没有人看到。
- en: At the heart of this house lies a strange mix of concepts. Postmodern classicist
    columns of the Disney World set. The unpolished edge of the vernacular. There
    is also an organicist bent to the whole thing, something more Goff than Gaudí,
    and here we see some of the house’s most organic forms, the monolith- or shell-like
    vanity mixed with the luminous artifice of mirrors and white. A backlit cave,
    primitive and performative at the same time, which is, in essence, the dialectic
    of the luxury bathroom.

  zh: 这座房子的核心蕴藏着一种奇特的概念混合。迪士尼世界舞台上的后现代古典主义柱子。俗语的未经雕琢的边缘。整个结构还带有一种有机主义的倾向，更接近戈夫（Goff）而非高迪（Gaudí），在这里我们看到房子最有机的形式之一，如单块石或贝壳般的梳妆台与镜子和白色的发光假象混合在一起。一个背光的洞穴，既原始又表演性，实质上是豪华浴室的辩证法。
- en: And yet our McMansion Heaven is still a McMansion. It is still an accumulation
    of deliberate signifiers of wealth, very much a construction with the secondary
    purpose of invoking envy, a palatial residence designed without much cohesion.
    The presence of golf, of wood, of masculine and patriarchal symbolism with an
    undercurrent of luxury drives that point home. The McMansion can aspire to an
    art form, but there are still many levels to ascend before one gets to where God’s
    sitting.

  zh: 然而，我们的大杂院天堂仍然是一座大杂院。它仍然是故意标示财富的积累，非常符合引发羡慕的次要目的，一个没有太多内在统一性的豪宅。高尔夫的存在，木材的存在，带有男性和家长权力象征的存在，伴随着奢华的暗流，进一步印证了这一点。大杂院可以向艺术形式迈进，但在达到上帝所在之处之前，还有许多层次要攀登。
