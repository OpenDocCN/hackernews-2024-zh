Ken had to get up at 04:00 so he could make the two-hour walk to the nearest road for his journey to the premiere in Glasgow.

He said he wasn't nervous - but his first trip away from the Highlands in decades made a big impression on him.

"The last time I was in Glasgow was 30 or 40 years ago - it's changed so much from what it used to be," he said.

" I don't know any of the places or anything like that, in the past I did.

"It's certainly a different form of life - I've never seen so many people. From where I am, where I live I can go weeks and never see anybody and I just carry on with my jobs."
