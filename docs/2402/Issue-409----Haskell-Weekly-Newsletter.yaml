- en: As some of you may have heard, Skills Matter, the organization that ran the
    Haskell eXchange for many years, is no longer running. Fortunately the Haskell
    Foundation was able to archive a significant majority of the Haskell-related videos
    before they became unavailable. This was done with the permission of Skills Matter,
    who provided us with the access. However, we have only the videos, we do not have
    descriptions or the name of the speaker. So we need your help organizing the material.
