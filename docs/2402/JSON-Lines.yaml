- en: This page describes the JSON Lines text format, also called newline-delimited
    JSON. JSON Lines is a convenient format for storing structured data that may be
    processed one record at a time. It works well with unix-style text processing
    tools and shell pipelines. It's a great format for log files. It's also a flexible
    format for passing messages between cooperating processes.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 1\. UTF-8 Encoding
  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: JSON allows encoding Unicode strings with only ASCII escape sequences, however
    those escapes will be hard to read when viewed in a text editor. The author of
    the JSON Lines file may choose to escape characters to work with plain ASCII files.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Encodings other than UTF-8 are very unlikely to be valid when decoded as UTF-8
    so the chance of [accidentally misinterpreting characters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mojibake)
    in JSON Lines files is low.

- en: 2\. Each Line is a Valid JSON Value
  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The most common values will be objects or arrays, but any JSON value is permitted.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: See [json.org](https://json.org/) for more information about JSON values.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 3\. Line Separator is `'\n'`
  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This means `'\r\n'` is also supported because surrounding white space is implicitly
    ignored when parsing JSON values.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The last character in the file *may* be a line separator, and it will be treated
    the same as if there was no line separator present.

- en: 4\. Suggested Conventions
  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: JSON Lines files may be saved with the file extension `.jsonl`.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Stream compressors like `gzip` or `bzip2` are recommended for saving space,
    resulting in `.jsonl.gz` or `.jsonl.bz2` files.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: MIME type may be `application/jsonl`, but this is not yet standardized; any
    help writing the RFC would be greatly appreciated (see [issue](https://github.com/wardi/jsonlines/issues/19)).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Text editing programs call the first line of a text file "line 1". The first
    value in a JSON Lines file should also be called "value 1".
