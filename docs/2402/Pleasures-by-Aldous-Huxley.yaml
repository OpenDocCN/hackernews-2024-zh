- en: We have heard a great deal, since 1914, about the things which are a menace
    to civilization. First it was Prussian militarism; then the Germans at large;
    then the prolongation of the war; then the shortening of the same; then, after
    a time, the Treaty of Versailles; then French militarism - with, all the while,
    a running accompaniment of such minor menaces as Prohibition, Lord Northcliffe,
    Mr. Bryan, Comstockery....

    well. For still, in 1923, it stands not so very far from where it stood in that
    "giant age before the flood" of nine years since. Where, in relation to Neanderthal
    on the one hand and Athens on the other, where precisely it stood *then* is a
    question which each may answer according to his taste. The important fact is that
    these menaces to our civilization, such as it is - menaces including the largest
    war and the stupidest peace known to history - have confined themselves in most
    places and up till now to mere threats, barking more furiously than they bite.

    dangers - wild men, wars and the bankruptcy that wars bring after them. The most
    alarming dangers are those which menace it from within, that threaten the mind
    rather than the body and estate of contemporary man.

    brews quietly up within its own bowels, few, it seems to me, are more deadly (while
    none appears more harmless) than that curious and appalling thing that is technically
    known as "pleasure." "Pleasure" (I place the word between inverted commas to show
    that I mean, not real pleasure, but the organized activities officially known
    by the same name) "pleasure" - what nightmare visions the word evokes! Like every
    man of sense and good feeling, I abominate work. But I would rather put in eight
    hours a day at a Government office than be condemned to lead a life of "pleasure";
    I would even, I believe, prefer to write a million words of journalism a year.

- en: The horrors of modern "pleasure" arise from the fact that every kind of organized
    distraction tends to become progressively more and more imbecile. There was a
    time when people indulged themselves with distractions requiring the expense of
    a certain intellectual effort. In the seventeenth century, for example, royal
    personages and their courtiers took a real delight in listening to erudite sermons
    (Dr. Donne's, for example) and academical disputes on points of theology or metaphysics.
    Part of the entertainment offered to the Prince Palatine, on the occasion of his
    marriage with James 1.'s daughter, was a syllogistic argumentation, on I forget
    what philosophical theme, between the amiable Lord Keeper Williams and a troop
    of minor Cambridge logicians. Imagine the feelings of a contemporary prince, if
    a loyal University were to offer him a similar entertainment!

    In Elizabethan times every lady and gentleman of ordinary culture could be relied
    upon, at demand, to take his or her part in a madrigal or a motet. Those who know
    the enormous complexity and subtlety of sixteenth-century music will realize what
    this means. To indulge in their favourite pastime our ancestors had to exert their
    minds to an uncommon degree. Even the uneducated vulgar delighted in pleasures
    requiring the exercise of a certain intelligence, individuality and personal initiative.
    They listened, for example, to *Othello*, *King Lear*, and *Hamlet* - apparently
    with enjoyment and comprehension. They sang and made much music. And far away,
    in the remote country, the peasants, year by year, went through the traditional
    rites - the dances of spring and summer, the winter mummings, the ceremonies of
    harvest home - appropriate to each successive season. Their pleasures were intelligent
    and alive, and it was they who, by their own efforts, entertained themselves.

    and personal initiative, we have vast organizations that provide us with ready-made
    distractions - distractions which demand from pleasure-seekers no personal participation
    and no intellectual effort of any sort. To the interminable democracies of the
    world a million cinemas bring the same stale balderdash. There have always been
    fourth-rate writers and dramatists; but their works, in the past, quickly died
    without getting beyond the boundaries of the city or the country in which they
    appeared. To-day, the inventions of the scenario-writer go out from Los Angeles
    across the whole world. Countless audiences soak passively in the tepid bath of
    nonsense. No mental effort is demanded of them, no participation; they need only
    sit and keep their eyes open.

    Now, they merely turn on the gramophone. Or if they are a little more up-to-date
    they adjust their wireless telephone to the right wave-length and listen-in to
    the fruity contralto at Marconi House, singing "The Gleaner's Slumber Song."

    Press exists to impart information. But its real function is to provide, like
    the cinema, a distraction which shall occupy the mind without demanding of it
    the slightest effort or the fatigue of a single thought. This function, it must
    be admitted, it fulfils with an extraordinary success. It is possible to go on
    for years and years, reading two papers every working day and one on Sundays without
    ever once being called upon to think or to make any other effort than to move
    the eyes, not very attentively, down the printed column.

    participation is demanded. Great numbers of the middle and upper classes play
    golf and tennis in person and, if they are sufficiently rich, shoot birds and
    pursue the fox and go ski-ing in the Alps. But the vast mass of the community
    has now come even to sport vicariously, preferring the watching of football to
    the fatigues and dangers of the actual game. All classes, it is true, still dance;
    but dance, all the world over, the same steps to the same tunes. The dance has
    been scrupulously sterilized of any local or personal individuality.

    for every one over the face of the whole Western world, are surely a worse menace
    to our civilization than ever the Germans were. The working hours of the day are
    already, for the great majority of human beings, occupied in the performance of
    purely mechanical tasks in which no mental effort, no individuality, no initiative
    are required. And now, in the hours of leisure, we turn to distractions as mechanically
    stereotyped and demanding as little intelligence and initiative as does our work.
    Add such leisure to such work and the sum is a perfect day which it is a blessed
    relief to come to the end of.

- en: 'Self-poisoned in this fashion, civilization looks as though it might easily
    decline into a kind of premature senility. With a mind almost atrophied by lack
    of use, unable to entertain itself and grown so wearily uninterested in the ready-made
    distractions offered from without that nothing but the grossest stimulants of
    an ever-increasing violence and crudity can move it, the democracy of the future
    will sicken of a chronic and mortal boredom. It will go, perhaps, the way the
    Romans went: the Romans who came at last to lose, precisely as we are doing now,
    the capacity to distract themselves; the Romans who, like us, lived on ready-made
    entertainments in which they had no participation. Their deadly ennui demanded
    ever more gladiators, more tightrope-walking elephants, more rare and far-fetched
    animals to be slaughtered. Ours would demand no less; but owing to the existence
    of a few idealists, doesn''t get all it asks for. The most violent forms of entertainment
    can only be obtained illicitly. Let us not despair, however; we may still live
    to see blood flowing across the stage of the Hippodrome. The force of a boredom
    clamouring to be alleviated may yet prove too much for the idealists.'
