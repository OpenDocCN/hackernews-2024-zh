- en: We have heard a great deal, since 1914, about the things which are a menace
    to civilization. First it was Prussian militarism; then the Germans at large;
    then the prolongation of the war; then the shortening of the same; then, after
    a time, the Treaty of Versailles; then French militarism - with, all the while,
    a running accompaniment of such minor menaces as Prohibition, Lord Northcliffe,
    Mr. Bryan, Comstockery....

  zh: 自1914年以来，我们听说了许多对文明构成威胁的事情。首先是普鲁士军国主义；然后是整个德国人；接着是战争的延长；再之后是战争的缩短；然后是一段时间后的凡尔赛条约；接着是法国的军国主义
    - 伴随着这些，还有一些次要的威胁，如禁酒法、诺思克利夫勋爵、布赖恩先生、康斯托克行动等等……
- en: Civilization, however, has resisted the combined attacks of these enemies wonderfully
    well. For still, in 1923, it stands not so very far from where it stood in that
    "giant age before the flood" of nine years since. Where, in relation to Neanderthal
    on the one hand and Athens on the other, where precisely it stood *then* is a
    question which each may answer according to his taste. The important fact is that
    these menaces to our civilization, such as it is - menaces including the largest
    war and the stupidest peace known to history - have confined themselves in most
    places and up till now to mere threats, barking more furiously than they bite.

- en: No, the dangers which confront our civilization are not so much the external
    dangers - wild men, wars and the bankruptcy that wars bring after them. The most

    brews quietly up within its own bowels, few, it seems to me, are more deadly (while
    none appears more harmless) than that curious and appalling thing that is technically
    known as "pleasure." "Pleasure" (I place the word between inverted commas to show
    that I mean, not real pleasure, but the organized activities officially known
    by the same name) "pleasure" - what nightmare visions the word evokes! Like every
    man of sense and good feeling, I abominate work. But I would rather put in eight
    hours a day at a Government office than be condemned to lead a life of "pleasure";
    I would even, I believe, prefer to write a million words of journalism a year.

  zh: 在现代文明内部，通过一种自我中毒的过程，酝酿出各种各样的毒药中，我认为没有什么比那个被称为“乐趣”的奇特而可怕的东西更致命（虽然看起来更无害）。“乐趣”（我用引号将其与真正的乐趣区分开来，指的是官方以同名活动所称呼的有组织活动）
    - “乐趣” - 这个词语引发了多少噩梦般的想象！像每一个理智和善感的人一样，我深恶痛绝工作。但我宁愿每天在政府办公室工作八小时，也不愿被迫过一种“乐趣”的生活；我甚至相信，我宁愿每年写一百万字的新闻。
- en: The horrors of modern "pleasure" arise from the fact that every kind of organized
    distraction tends to become progressively more and more imbecile. There was a
    time when people indulged themselves with distractions requiring the expense of
    a certain intellectual effort. In the seventeenth century, for example, royal
    personages and their courtiers took a real delight in listening to erudite sermons
    (Dr. Donne's, for example) and academical disputes on points of theology or metaphysics.
    Part of the entertainment offered to the Prince Palatine, on the occasion of his
    marriage with James 1.'s daughter, was a syllogistic argumentation, on I forget
    what philosophical theme, between the amiable Lord Keeper Williams and a troop
    of minor Cambridge logicians. Imagine the feelings of a contemporary prince, if
    a loyal University were to offer him a similar entertainment!

  zh: 现代“乐趣”的恐怖来自于这样一个事实，即各种有组织的分心倾向于变得越来越愚蠢。曾经有段时间，人们沉溺于需要一定智力努力的娱乐活动中。例如，在十七世纪，皇室人物及其宫廷侍臣们真正喜欢聆听博学的布道（例如唐恩博士的布道）以及在神学或形而上学问题上的学术辩论。例如，奥本格伦的结婚庆典上，提供给普法腊公爵的一部分娱乐是由和蔼可亲的威廉姆斯大法官和一队剑桥小逻辑学家之间进行的关于某个哲学主题的三段论辩论。想象一下，如果一所忠诚的大学今天要给当代的王子类似的娱乐活动，他们的感受会是怎样的！
- en: Royal personages were not the only people who enjoyed intelligent pleasures.
    In Elizabethan times every lady and gentleman of ordinary culture could be relied
    upon, at demand, to take his or her part in a madrigal or a motet. Those who know
    the enormous complexity and subtlety of sixteenth-century music will realize what
    this means. To indulge in their favourite pastime our ancestors had to exert their
    minds to an uncommon degree. Even the uneducated vulgar delighted in pleasures
    requiring the exercise of a certain intelligence, individuality and personal initiative.
    They listened, for example, to *Othello*, *King Lear*, and *Hamlet* - apparently
    with enjoyment and comprehension. They sang and made much music. And far away,
    in the remote country, the peasants, year by year, went through the traditional
    rites - the dances of spring and summer, the winter mummings, the ceremonies of
    harvest home - appropriate to each successive season. Their pleasures were intelligent
    and alive, and it was they who, by their own efforts, entertained themselves.

  zh: 皇室人物并不是唯一享受智慧乐趣的人。在伊丽莎白时代，每位普通文化修养的绅士和淑女在需要时都能够在一部狂热的四部合唱曲或是单声道清唱中演唱他们自己的角色。了解十六世纪音乐的巨大复杂性和微妙性的人会意识到这意味着什么。为了沉溺于他们喜爱的消遣活动，我们的祖先必须以不同寻常的程度来努力他们的心智。即使是没有受过教育的粗俗人，也会喜欢需要一定智力、个性和个人主动性的乐趣。例如，他们会聆听《奥赛罗》、《李尔王》和《哈姆雷特》——显然是带着享受和理解的。他们唱歌，做出许多音乐。在遥远的乡村，农民们年复一年地参加传统仪式——春夏季的舞蹈，冬天的狂欢节，以及每个季节的丰收庆典——适应了他们的需求。他们的乐趣是有智慧和生命力的，而是他们通过自己的努力来娱乐自己。
- en: We have changed all that. In place of the old pleasures demanding intelligence
    and personal initiative, we have vast organizations that provide us with ready-made
    distractions - distractions which demand from pleasure-seekers no personal participation
    and no intellectual effort of any sort. To the interminable democracies of the
    world a million cinemas bring the same stale balderdash. There have always been
    fourth-rate writers and dramatists; but their works, in the past, quickly died
    without getting beyond the boundaries of the city or the country in which they
    appeared. To-day, the inventions of the scenario-writer go out from Los Angeles
    across the whole world. Countless audiences soak passively in the tepid bath of
    nonsense. No mental effort is demanded of them, no participation; they need only
    sit and keep their eyes open.

    golf and tennis in person and, if they are sufficiently rich, shoot birds and
    pursue the fox and go ski-ing in the Alps. But the vast mass of the community
    has now come even to sport vicariously, preferring the watching of football to
    the fatigues and dangers of the actual game. All classes, it is true, still dance;
    but dance, all the world over, the same steps to the same tunes. The dance has

    purely mechanical tasks in which no mental effort, no individuality, no initiative
    are required. And now, in the hours of leisure, we turn to distractions as mechanically
    stereotyped and demanding as little intelligence and initiative as does our work.

    an ever-increasing violence and crudity can move it, the democracy of the future
    will sicken of a chronic and mortal boredom. It will go, perhaps, the way the
    Romans went: the Romans who came at last to lose, precisely as we are doing now,
    the capacity to distract themselves; the Romans who, like us, lived on ready-made
    entertainments in which they had no participation. Their deadly ennui demanded
    ever more gladiators, more tightrope-walking elephants, more rare and far-fetched
    animals to be slaughtered. Ours would demand no less; but owing to the existence
    of a few idealists, doesn''t get all it asks for. The most violent forms of entertainment
    can only be obtained illicitly. Let us not despair, however; we may still live
    to see blood flowing across the stage of the Hippodrome. The force of a boredom
    clamouring to be alleviated may yet prove too much for the idealists.'
