  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Data egress is the term used to describe data leaving a network, more specifically,
    **data leaving your cloud provider's network** out to the public internet. This
    can be data sent from a cloud provider to a user, or data sent from one cloud
    provider to another.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Cloud providers typically charge for egress based on the amount of data sent
    out of their network, and it's usually measured in gigabytes (GB) or terabytes
    (TB) of data transfer per month.

    provider.
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To download the file, the user's device is requesting data from the cloud provider's
    network, and the cloud provider is sending the data out to the user (or to an
    intermediary like a content delivery network). This is where egress fees come
    into play.

- en: Why do cloud providers charge for egress?
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Cloud providers charge for egress because it costs them money to send data out
    of their network. They have to pay for the infrastructure and bandwidth required
    to send data to users.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It's also important to note that not all networks are created equal. Some cloud
    providers may have better peering agreements with ISPs or more reliable network
    infrastructure, which can affect the cost of egress too.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: However, egress fees may also be used to discourage certain types of usage that
    may saturate the network, or constantly moving large amounts of data between cloud
    providers.

- en: Most cloud providers do offer a certain amount of free egress each month. For
    example, as an account-wide allowance (eg. 100 GB / mo), or pooled across the
    number of servers you have with them (eg. 1 TB / mo per server).

    to avoid egress fees altogether or keep them to a minimum.
