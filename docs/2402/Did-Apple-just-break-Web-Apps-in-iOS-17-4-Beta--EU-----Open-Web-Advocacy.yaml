    that Apple has broken Web App (PWA) support in the EU via iOS 17.4 Beta. Sites
    installed to the homescreen failed to launch in their own top-level activities,
    opening in Safari instead. This demotes Web Apps from first-class citizens in
    the OS to mere shortcuts. Developers confirmed the bug did not occur [outside
    the EU](https://twitter.com/mysk_co/status/1753402489049616427).'

- en: This bug should have been picked up within seconds of testing any Web App. So
    how did this issue slip through? One possibility is Web Apps aren’t routinely
    tested by the Safari or iOS teams and that automated regression testing is not
    in place. This might explain the parade of show stopping iOS Web App bugs that
    shipped to stable over the past 15 years.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Another explanation might be the complexity posed by Apple’s [mess of a compliance
    proposal](/blog/owa-review-apple-dma-compliance-for-web/) which creates a separate
    version of iOS for the EU. We wrote about [the testing problems Apple’s proposal
    looks set to cause web developers](/blog/developers-react-apple-eu-dma-compliance/),
    and perhaps Apple is the first casualty of this self-defeating attempt at geofencing
    browser progress.

    physically located in the EU. This is the madness that Apple's malicious and spiteful
    Digital Markets Act compliance proposal will inflict on web developers and businesses
    globally.

    community thanks to Apple’s long history of [neglect and denial of features for
    iOS Safari](/walled-gardens-report/#safari-lags-behind-and-is-missing-key-features).
    The choice to underinvest might only be problematic, save for [Apple's effective
    ban of third party browsers.](/walled-gardens-report/#apple-has-effectively-banned-all-third-party-browsers)
    Because third-party browsers cannot provide their own Web App features, if it
    doesn't work in iOS Safari, it doesn't work on iOS.

    revenue protection motive:'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Apple generates revenue through its App Store, both by charging developers for
    access to the App Store and by taking a commission for payments made via Apple
    IAP. Apple therefore benefits from higher usage of native apps on iOS. By requiring
    all browsers on iOS to use the WebKit browser engine, **Apple is able to exert
    control over the maximum functionality of all browsers on iOS** and, as a consequence,
    hold up the development and use of web apps. This limits the **competitive constraint
    that web apps pose on native apps**, which in turn protects and benefits Apple’s
    App Store revenues. [UK CMA - Interim Report into Mobile Ecosystems](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/mobile-ecosystems-market-study-interim-report)

    end result is the same. Unusably poor support for Web Apps on iOS. Apple does
    not face effective browser competition, leading to show stopping iOS web bugs
    with shocking regularity.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Imagine now that genuine and effective browser competition was allowed on iOS.
    Under these conditions, showstopping Safari bugs would allow developers to recommend
    more capable browsers. This, in turn, would force Apple to invest in Safari, reducing
    the incidence of terrible web experiences for iOS users. This would lead to a
    vibrant, capable web that would unlock investment by developers and businesses,
    allowing them to deliver services via the web to iOS users.

    It is this competition that Apple has denied iOS since its inception and that
    must be restored globally, not just in the EU.
