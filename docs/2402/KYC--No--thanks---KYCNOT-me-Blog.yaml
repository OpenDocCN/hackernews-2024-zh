    the identity, suitability, and risks involved with maintaining a business relationship
    with a customer. Such procedures fit within the broader scope of anti-money laundering
    (AML) and counterterrorism financing (CTF) regulations.

    information is flowing around the internet in the hands of "god-knows-who" and
    secured by "trust-me-bro military-grade encryption". Once your account is linked
    to your personal (and verified) identity, tracking you is just as easy as keeping
    logs on all these platforms.

    They're crafty. They may adopt false identities or find alternative strategies
    to continue their operations. Far from being outwitted, many times they're several
    steps ahead of regulations. Realistically, KYC might deter a small fraction –
    let's say about 1% ^(– of these malefactors. Yet, the cost? All of us are saddled
    with the inconvenient process of identification just to use a service.)

    cameras in every nook and cranny. A band of criminals, intent on robbing a local
    store, rolls in with a stolen car, their faces obscured by masks and their bodies
    cloaked in all-black clothes. Once they've committed the crime and exited the
    city's boundaries, they switch vehicles and clothes out of the cameras' watchful
    eyes. The high-tech surveillance? It didn’t manage to identify or trace them.
    Yet, for every law-abiding citizen who merely wants to drive through the city
    or do some shopping, their movements and identities are constantly logged. The
    irony? This invasive tracking impacts all of us, just to catch the 1% ^(of less-than-careful
    criminals.)

- en: KYC puts barriers between many users and businesses. One of these comes from
    the fact that the process often requires multiple forms of identification, proof
    of address, and sometimes even financial records. For individuals in areas with
    poor record-keeping, non-recognized legal documents, or those who are unbanked,
    homeless or transient, obtaining these documents can be challenging, if not impossible.
