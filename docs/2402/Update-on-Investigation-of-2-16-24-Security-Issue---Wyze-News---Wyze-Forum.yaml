    your Wyze account.
  id: totrans-split-8

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The outage originated from our partner AWS and took down Wyze devices for several
    hours early Friday morning. If you tried to view live cameras or events during
    that time, you likely weren’t able to. We’re very sorry for the frustration and
    confusion this caused.

    Some users reported seeing the wrong thumbnails and Event Videos in their Events
    tab. We immediately removed access to the Events tab and started an investigation.

- en: We can now confirm that as cameras were coming back online, about 13,000 Wyze
    users received thumbnails from cameras that were not their own and 1,504 users
    tapped on them. Most taps enlarged the thumbnail, but in some cases it could have
    caused an Event Video to be viewed.

    that were not yours, but your thumbnails and Event Videos were not seen by anyone
    else.

- en: The incident was caused by a third-party caching client library that was recently
    integrated into our system. This client library received unprecedented load conditions
    caused by devices coming back online all at once. As a result of increased demand,
    it mixed up device ID and user ID mapping and connected some data to incorrect
    accounts.

- en: To make sure this doesn’t happen again, we have added a new layer of verification
    before users are connected to Event Videos. We have also modified our system to
    bypass caching for checks on user-device relationships until we identify new client
    libraries that are thoroughly stress tested for extreme events like we experienced
    on Friday.

    to protect customers or mirror the other investments and actions we have taken
    in recent years to make security a top priority at Wyze. We built a security team,
    implemented multiple processes, created new dashboards, maintained a bug bounty
    program, and were undergoing multiple 3rd party audits and penetration testing
    when this event occurred.

    and are dedicated to rebuilding your trust.
