    with the 2024 program. Over the past 20 years, 19K new contributors were introduced
    to #opensource through the program under the guidance of thousands of mentors
    from over 800 open-source organizations in various fields. Qdrant participated
    successfully in the program last year. Both projects, the UI Dashboard with unstructured
    data visualization and the advanced Geo Filtering, were completed in time and
    are now a part of the engine. One of the two young contributors joined the team
    and continues working on the project.'

    program for unknown reasons, but instead, we are introducing our own 𝐐𝐝𝐫𝐚𝐧𝐭 𝐒𝐮𝐦𝐦𝐞𝐫
    𝐨𝐟 𝐂𝐨𝐝𝐞 program with a stipend for contributors! To not reinvent the wheel, we
    follow all the timelines and rules of the official Google program.
