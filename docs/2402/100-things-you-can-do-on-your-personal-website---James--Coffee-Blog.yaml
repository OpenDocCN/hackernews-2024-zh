    Indeed, this website is the culmination of years of tinkering. I have added features
    like coffee shop maps that I can share with friends, a way for me to share my
    bio in two languages, a sitemap.xml file to help search engines find pages on
    my website, and more.

    not meant to be a checklist so much as a source for inspiration. Perhaps one of
    the ideas below will take you down a deligthful rabbit hole that leads you to
    new learnings. Perhaps an idea will bring you joy. Perhaps some ideas aren't right
    for your site, but that still get you thinking.
