- en: Optimistic thinking has long been immortalized in self-help books as the key
    to happiness, good health and longevity but it can also lead to poor decision
    making, with particularly serious implications for people’s financial wellbeing.

    associated with lower cognitive skills such as verbal fluency, fluid reasoning,
    numerical reasoning, and memory. Whereas those high on cognitive ability tend
    to be both more realistic and pessimistic in their expectations about the future.

    expect those with low cognitive ability to make more errors in judgments, both
    pessimistic and optimistic. But the results are clear: low cognitive ability leads
    to more self-flattering biases - people essentially deluding themselves to a degree.”
    said [Dr Chris Dawson](https://researchportal.bath.ac.uk/en/persons/chris-dawson)
    of the University’s School of Management.'

    the best, those high on cognitive ability are more able to override this automatic
    response when it comes to important decisions. Plans based on overly optimistic
    beliefs make for poor decisions and are bound to deliver worse outcomes than would
    realistic beliefs,” Dr Dawson added.

    and any choice involving risk and uncertainty, were particularly prone to this
    effect and posed serious implications for individuals.

    of consumption and debt, as well as insufficient savings. It can also lead to
    excessive business entries and subsequent failures. The chances of starting a
    successful business are tiny, but optimists always think they have a shot and
    will start businesses destined to fail,” Dr Dawson said.

    Financial Expectations”](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/01461672231209400)
    - took data from a UK survey of over 36,000 households and looked at people’s
    expectations of their financial wellbeing and compared them with their actual
    financial outcomes. The research found that those highest on cognitive ability
    experienced a 22% increase in the probability of “realism” and a 35 per cent decrease
    in the probability of “extreme optimism”.'

    affect our quality of decision making, particularly when we have to make serious
    decisions. We need to be able to over-ride that and this research shows that people
    with high cognitive ability manage this better than those with low cognitive ability,”

    has shown people consistently underestimate the negative and accentuate the positive.
    The concept of ‘positive thinking’ is almost unquestioningly embedded in our culture
    – and it would be healthy to revisit that belief,” Dr Dawson added
