    and replacements it makes mean you’re basically getting a new gadget at a lower
    price so it’s worth checking its refurb store for the Vision Pro or any other
    piece of Apple tech you’re after before just buying new – provided you aren’t

    feel the need to use it a lot to feel your purchase is justified. But as we heard
    from some early test events that media were invited to the device could be uncomfortable
    to wear for long stretches – especially when using the Solo Loop band that offers
    zero over-the-head support.

  zh: 当你在 Vision Pro 上花费这么多时，你可能会觉得需要经常使用它，以证明你的购买是合理的。但正如我们从一些媒体邀请的早期测试活动中听到的，设备可能在长时间佩戴时会感到不适——特别是在使用提供零头戴支撑的
    Solo Loop 带时。

    people who are new to VR – but the Vision Pro may exacerbate these problems as,

    like they’re getting the most out of the headset.

    films – the two main Vision Pro uses. Blockbusters can stretch on for two hours

    pointed out – such as [The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/24054862/apple-vision-pro-review-vr-ar-headset-features-price)

    [The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/24054862/apple-vision-pro-review-vr-ar-headset-features-price)——其中大多数程序都是从
    iPadOS 移植过来的。

    the iPad programs feel more interactive in mixed reality, but when people think

- en: The Vision Pro doesn’t have a good answer (or in some cases any answer at all)
    to these apps that you can find on rival platforms, and unfortunately for Apple,
    this is something that will take time to change. And if it seems like all you’re
    getting are iPad apps, why not save a lot of money and just buy an iPad – or even
