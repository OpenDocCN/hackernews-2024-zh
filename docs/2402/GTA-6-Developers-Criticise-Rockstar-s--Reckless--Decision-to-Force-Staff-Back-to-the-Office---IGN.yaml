    of its return-to-office order, due to start in April, which it said had to do
    with completing development on GTA 6 “at the level of quality and polish we know
    it requires”, and to mitigate security breaches. GTA 6 is developed primarily
    at Rockstar North in Edinburgh, Scotland, although support comes from a number
    of other Rockstar studios across the UK and the world.

- en: According to the IWGB, last year 170 Rockstar Games workers in the UK signed
    a petition opposing mandatory three-day office work. Now, workers accuse Rockstar
    of “broken promises”, and have expressed concern about health, caring responsibilities,
    living arrangements, and a heightened risk of overwork (crunch). Some workers
    have said they moved their lives further away from studio locations that would
    now need to be reversed in under six weeks to comply with Rockstar’s demands.
    Rockstar is yet to comment.

    available in an employee-wide email that said: “This isn’t our first step to five
    days a week. No one wants to go back to the old way of working.” The IWGB went
    on to claim Rockstar management has so-far refused to engage with workers on the
    issue, and will “pull the plug” on remote access to technology on April 15.'

    a lifeline for many of us at Rockstar, allowing us to balance care responsibilities,
    manage disabilities, and relocate as we need. Now, Rockstar is snatching away
    that lifeline without a second thought for the workers who’ll be impacted most.
    After so many broken promises we now fear management may even be paving the way
    for a return to toxic ‘crunch’ practices. Senior leadership need to rethink their
    reckless decision making and engage with their staff to find an arrangement that
    works for everyone.”'

    who these policy changes most affect. Just one of my concerns is being forced
    to work late hours in the office to maintain contact with global teams when before
    we could log on from home to attend late meetings. This will mean missing out
    on spending time with our families. I am also aware of colleagues who have health
    issues preventing full time office work who are now left in limbo.”'

    for brutal crunch in the making of Grand Theft Auto and Red Dead games. However,
    following the release of [Red Dead Redemption 2](/games/red-dead-redemption-2)
    in 2018 and [the shocking stories about the human cost of its development](https://www.eurogamer.net/the-human-cost-of-red-dead-redemption-2),
    media reports suggested changes were made to the company’s culture to avoid the
    same thing happening during the development of GTA 6.
