    former friends and colleagues describe the bespectacled, soft-spoken political
    theorist as introverted and obsessively discreet. It took former Chinese leader
    Jiang Zemin’s repeated entreaties to convince the brilliant then-young academic—who
    spoke wistfully of following the traditional path of a Confucian scholar, aloof
    from politics—to give up academia in the early 1990s and join the Chinese Communist
    Party regime instead. When he finally did so, Wang cut off nearly all contact
    with his former connections, stopped publishing and speaking publicly, and implemented
    a strict policy of never speaking to foreigners at all. Behind this veil of carefully

- en: Examining China in the midst of Deng’s rapid opening to the world, Wang perceived
    a country “in a state of transformation” from “an economy of production to an

    always positive”—he argued that, “Since 1949, we have criticized the core values
    of the classical and modern structures, but have not paid enough attention to
    shaping our own core values.” Therefore: “we must create core values.” Ideally,

    knowledge, politics, power, and law can all become the target of commodification.”
    This “commodification, in many ways, corrupts society and leads to a number of
    serious social problems.” In the end, “the American economic system has created
