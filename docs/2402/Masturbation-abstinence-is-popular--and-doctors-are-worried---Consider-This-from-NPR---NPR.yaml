- en: '"Spokespeople of online forums like NoFap, for example, have been very concerned
    with distancing themselves from anything having to do with extremism," says Burke.
    "Alt-right, neo-Nazi, white supremacist, antisemitic — they are very clear to
    say we are not that. But they''re not willing to recognize what I think is just
    an empirical reality, which is that some people who buy into porn addiction rhetoric
    also buy into these more extremist beliefs."'

  zh: '"像NoFap这样的在线论坛发言人非常关心与极端主义无关的事情，" Burke说道。"像极右、新纳粹、白人至上主义、反犹太主义等等 — 他们非常明确地说我们不是那样的。但他们不愿意承认我认为只是经验事实的事情，即一些信奉色情成瘾论调的人也会信奉这些更极端的信念。"'
- en: It's not fair to say there's cause and effect at work, Burke says. But, she
    worries about people who may be socially and emotionally vulnerable, potentially
    without access to mental health providers, finding themselves in nofap spaces
    and then ending up somewhere else. Those who have raised these and other issues
    about the nofap world have experienced a pattern of pushback.

- en: Interviews with researchers, court documents and other reporting paint a picture
    of an established tendency of some supporters of masturbation abstinence to harass
    critics by calling employers or targeting them with misogynist or antisemitic
    slurs, and even violent threats. Some academics say this has a chilling effect
    on people wanting to do more research on the subject. There is no evidence that
    NoFap LLC or Alexander Rhodes has engaged in threats or hate speech.
