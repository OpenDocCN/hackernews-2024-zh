- en: As Pitchfork grew from a niche blog to the tastemaker of the indie music wave,
    and from Chicago to Brooklyn, bankers began to circle. VCs offered to inject capital.
    The swaggering Vice repeatedly suggested an acquisition that would’ve made Pitchfork
    the company’s flagship music arm. Founder Ryan Schreiber and longtime CEO Chris
    Kaskie were wary of selling to a partner who, in exchange for funding, would demand
    rapid growth. “Scale/investment always felt wrong and we said no to all of it,
    especially from the VC/PE world,” Kaskie told me in an email.

    and Kaskie realized that Pitchfork needed a partner. At the time, the digital
    music site had worked with Condé Nast to develop several video projects. The legacy
    magazine publisher had been pleased with the collaboration, and in Pitchfork,
    saw an opportunity. Condé was late in transitioning to the digital news era, and
    was impressed by Pitchfork’s creative editorial voice and the direct traffic to
    its homepage. Pitchfork had won a prestigious National Magazine Award in 2013
    for excellence in digital media. And Condé, which did not have a music-first title,
    was also looking to expand its events business, and was intrigued by Pitchfork’s
    festivals in Paris and Chicago. Pitchfork’s leadership felt that Condé had a long
    track record of serving as a responsible steward for the important titles, like
    The New Yorker and Vanity Fair. On October 13, 2015, the two sides announced that
    Pitchfork would join Condé.

    departures, and most of all the dramatic shifts in digital media began to slowly
    chip away at Pitchfork.

- en: The site — born in the texty ‘90s web — went through a familiar set of digital
    media spasms. In 2012, YouTube had given Pitchfork money to create original content
    for Pitchfork TV, which had impressed Condé Nast. But within a few years, Conde
    moved Pitchfork’s video team under Condé Nast Entertainment, its commercial special
    projects arm. CNE, which continues to struggle to turn video into a profitable
    business, was not interested in continuing many of the video projects and channels
    Pitchfork had nearly a dozen full time staffers working on pre-acquisition. Video
    staff eventually left or were laid off. Pitchfork also saw some of its identity
    folded into corporate efficiencies. Its in-house design and creative teams, which
    had helped win the publication awards for editorial, were similarly absorbed or
    laid off.

    of programmatic advertising sales. Condé chief digital officer Fred Santarpia
    had irritated Pitchfork staff when he told the New York Times in 2015 that Pitchfork
    would help Condé with male audiences, an idea that some inside Condé could not
    shake. In 2016, Condé Nast sorted the news brands under three different umbrellas:
    Fashion, Men’s, and Culture. Pitchfork still was furious that the publication
    was initially placed into the “Men’s” bucket.'

- en: After Santarpia, who led the acquisition, left in 2018, there were fewer voices
    at the executive level to advocate for Pitchfork. Where Pitchfork’s leadership
    once reported to Santarpia, the publication was put under the purview of Anna
    Wintour, who several current and former staff did not seem to express particular
    interest in the site. In 2017, two years into a five year contract, Kaskie quit
    over frustrations with Condé about the diminishment of his role within Pitchfork,
    and the publication’s autonomy within the parent company. Schreiber never found
    a clear role within Condé Nast’s business side, and left years before the end
    of his contract. As digital media began to sputter in 2018, a new editor, Puja
    Patel, attempted to diversify Pitchfork’s staff and broaden the perspectives without
    compromising its editorial voice. But she also faced pressure to cut costs as
    traffic from social media platforms declined and Spotify’s algorithms siphoned
    off more casual fans who’d used Pitchfork for music discovery.

    still didn’t quite *get* Pitchfork, at least in the eyes of staff.

- en: Condé has fulfilled some of the initial vision for Pitchfork’s consumer events
    business. Over the last several years, the publication has expanded into three
    new cities (London, Berlin, and Mexico City), and thrown other ticketed parties.
    The company has increased revenue from sponsorships of the festival, which has
    offset some softer ticket scans for several years at the festivals. But there
    has also been creative friction between Pitchfork and the parent company over
    the events. Pitchfork staff butted heads with Condé over attempts to further monetize
    the festival in a way that some felt eroded the brand. Condéhad pushed to make
    the festival experience more “luxury.” In 2016, a group of Condé sales people
    attended the festival in Chicago. Some complained afterwards that it was “not
    chic enough.” Condé pushed to build out Pitchfork’s VIP ticket experience for
    the festivals, an easy new potential source of revenue, prompting grumbling within
    Pitchfork about whether that would interfere with the actual VIP areas the publication
    already had for artists. In a recent meeting, one Condé senior vice president
    in charge of events made the outlandish suggestion that Pitchfork could juice
    ticket sales by reuniting Oasis or the White Stripes.
