- en: Stone tool use is a rare behavior across nonhuman primates. Here we report the
    first population of common long-tailed macaques (Macaca fascicularis fascicularis)
    who customarily used stone tools to open rock oysters (Saccostrea forskali) on
    a small island along the Thai Gulf in Koh Ped (KPE), eastern Thailand. We observed
    this population several times during the past 10 years, but no stone-tool use
    behavior was observed until our survey during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)
    pandemic in July 2022\. KPE is located in Pattaya City, a hotspot for tourism
    in Thailand. Tourists in this area frequently provided large amounts of food for
    the monkeys on KPE. During the COVID-19 curfew, however, tourists were not allowed
    to access the island, and monkeys began to face food scarcity. During this time,
    we observed stone-tool use behavior for the first time on KPE. Based on our observations,
    the first tool manipulation was similar to stone throwing (a known precursor of
    stone tool use). From our observations in March 2023, we found 17 subadult/adult
    animals performing the behavior, 15 of 17 were males and mostly solitary while
    performing the behavior. The M. f. fascicularis subspecies was confirmed by distribution,
    morphological characteristics, and mtDNA and SRY gene sequences. Taken together,
    we proposed that the stone tool use behavior in the KPE common long-tailed macaques
    emerged due to the COVID-19 food scarcity. Since traveling is no longer restricted
    many tourists have started coming back to the island, and there is a high risk
    for this stone tool-use behavior to disappear within this population of long-tailed
    macaques.
