- en: Tauri is a framework for building tiny, fast binaries for all major desktop
    and mobile platforms. Developers can integrate any frontend framework that compiles
    to HTML, JavaScript, and CSS for building their user experience while leveraging
    languages such as Rust, Swift, and Kotlin for backend logic when needed.

    by using one of the below commands. Be sure to follow the [prerequisites guide](/start/prerequisites/)
    to install all of the dependencies required by Tauri and then view the [Frontend
    Configuration guides](/start/frontend/) for recommended frontend configurations.

    and type-safety offered by Rust. Apps built on Tauri can automatically get those
    benefits even without needing to be developed by Rust experts.

- en: Tauri also undergoes a security audit for major and minor releases. This not
    only covers code in the Tauri organization, but also for upstream dependencies
    that Tauri relies on. Of course this doesn’t mitigate all risks, but it provides
    a solid foundation for developers to build on top of.

    system. A Tauri app only contains the code and assets specific for that app and
    doesn’t need to bundle a browser engine with every app. This means that a minimal
    Tauri app can be less than 600KB in size.

    is compatible with Tauri. The [Frontend Configuration guide](/start/frontend/)
    contains common configurations for popular frontend frameworks and the [Rendering

    Tauri (such as SPAs and SSGs).
