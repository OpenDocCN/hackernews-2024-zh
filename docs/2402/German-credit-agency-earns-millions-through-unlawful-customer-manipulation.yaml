- en: '**Lucrative business at the expense of apartment seekers.** Anyone looking
    for a flat or house to rent in Germany is regularly asked to prove their financial
    reliability. As a result, people looking for accommodation often end up at credit
    agencies such as SCHUFA – which make a fortune by selling people in Germany their
    own data. What SCHUFA deliberately conceals: according to Article 15 GDPR, it
    would have to provide precisely this data free of charge and without delay.'

    “BonitätsAuskunft” for €29.95 to private individuals and claims that it offers
    an “advantage on the housing market”. A transparent reference to the Article 15
    GDPR right to free information is not provided. Using manipulative designs, the
    company is trying to push the sale of paid products and even falsely presents
    the free information as unsuitable for submission to third parties.'

    that only its paid products can be presented to third parties. In reality, the

    is unlikely to even find the free information. Although the GDPR stipulates that
    companies must support data subjects in obtaining their free information, SCHUFA
    does not even mention it by name. The company casually refers to the information
    in accordance with Article 15 GDPR as a “data copy”. In fact, a range of further
    information needs to be included as well. At the same time, the legal term “information”
    in accordance with Article 15 is misused for the paid product (BonitätsAuskunft).
    Anyone who manages to find the hidden option to request the information free of
    charge is once again bombarded with adverts for the paid product. In addition,
    SCHUFA advises against sharing the free information with third parties. On the
    one hand, it supposedly contains sensitive data, but on the other hand *“not an
    up-to-date calculation of your creditworthiness scores”*.'

- en: '**Data is deliberately withheld.** As a result, SCHUFA is violating European
    data protection law in several ways. The company doesn’t take any measures to
    make it easy for data subjects to exercise their right of access to data, contrary
    to the clear requirements of the GDPR. Additionally, the company deliberately
    withholds information in order to be able to sell its paid product: For example,
    in the case of the complainant, the free information included only a “basic score”,
    while the paid information showed six different “industry scores”. Article 15
    GDPR obliges the company to disclose all processed data in full. To make matters
    worse, the complainant received the paid product after five days, while the free
    information, which was ordered at the same time, took significantly longer. Here,
    too, the GDPR actually requires an “immediate” delivery.'

    against SCHUFA with the Hessian data protection authority. By systematically hiding
    and delaying the free information and deliberately withholding data, the company
    is in breach of the GDPR. In addition, *noyb* is filing a report with the Hessian
    DPA. SCHUFA systematically violates the legal requirement of free information
    by creating the impression that only the paid products are suitable as proof to
    third parties.'
