    but I've come across some new information that isn't the same AP newswire story
    told over and over. It's not investigative reporting from

    Now, the guy doing this is not a broadcaster or even a radio enthusiast, so do
    take their narration with a grain of salt. He does botch one important fact at
    the end of the video, but what I think is newsworthy is the actual video shot
    on the WJLX tower site.

    the door, which was hanging by just one hinge and open to the elements. Second,
    the interior looked like it had been empty and exposed to the elements for quite
    some time. Third, the power meter on the exterior of the shack was disconnected
    and missing. It appears to me that it's been that way for a while. Months? Years?
    Who knows.

    that the station has not been transmitting from its licensed site, which is a
    cell phone tower about a block north of the Curry VFD in the town of Curry, north
    of Jasper. Instead, according to Street View, there's a one bay vertically polarized
    antenna mounted to the Curry water tower which is probably a few tenths of a mile
    from the licensed site. Interestingly, the WJBE CP

    in 2021 and then again in 2024 but they never filed any licenses to cover for
    the water tower site.

    Community Broadcasting has Brett Elmore as a officer of the organization and is
    the primary contact for them. So I guess cheating on the AM rules isn't enough,
    he also skirts the licensed site rules.

    90.1 in Hamilton. It's been granted the WERH call sign that was on stations in
    Hamilton for years prior. Makes me wonder if they'll skirt some rules there as
    well just because it seems to be a pattern. Allegedly, of course.
