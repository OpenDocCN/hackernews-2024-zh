    the Foundation needed more support. To deliver that, they [launched the Foundation''s
    membership program](https://matrix.org/blog/2022/12/01/funding-matrix-via-the-matrix-org-foundation/#introducing-foundation-memberships-and-the-governing-board).
    They also introduced open governance, and committed to hiring a Managing Director
    to act as a robust, neutral steward.'

    The open network has grown from 80.3M to 115M addressable users. We've invested
    in long-term interoperability efforts at the IETF. And we've shifted focus from
    experiments to polish, usability, and advocacy.

    core development annually, but we are paying our own bills now. While we managed
    a 400+% increase in revenue to ¬£364K last year, at ¬£440K our expenses exceeded
    our revenue. As we enter our first full year of paying our own bills, the full
    cost of operating the Foundation at its current scope is projected to stabilize
    somewhere north of ¬£900K in 2024\. And the more we can raise beyond ¬£900K, the
    less dependent the ecosystem is on Element.
