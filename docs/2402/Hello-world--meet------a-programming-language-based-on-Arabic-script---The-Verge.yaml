    nearly every computer language, platform, and standard in history has been built
    around a Latin character set — a set of symbols that, in many cases, is utterly
    mysterious to them. It''s with that in mind that computer scientist Ramsey Nasser
    has built قلب (pronounced "Alb," *lit*. "heart"), a fully-functional programming
    language based on Arabic script.'

    in this situation. When faced with Arabic, terminals and text editors either crash
    or have no idea what to do. Nasser, a resident of the Eyebeam technology lab who
    teaches programming to students around the world, says it usually makes more sense
    to learn English before learning to code. "That shocked me," he says in [an interview](http://www.animalnewyork.com/2013/arabic-programming-language-at-eyebeam-%D9%82%D9%84%D8%A8-opens-the-world/)
    with *Animal New York*. "I believe that code and computation should be something
    anyone can access." Previous attempts have been made, like [AMMORIA](http://sourceforge.net/projects/ammoria/),
    an open source language that uses Arabic words. But Nasser's project doubles as
    a kind of conceptual art piece, looking into the unique aesthetics of Arabic script
    and how they can be made to function in a coding environment.

- en: At Eyebeam's latest [Annual Showcase](http://www.eyebeam.org/events/annual-showcase),
    Nasser demoed several small programs he made with قلب, including the obligatory
    "Hello World," an algorithm that computes [Fibonacci numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number),
    and even a recreation of the mathematical "zero-player game," [Conway's Game of
    Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life). The language isn't
    perfect, and it probably will never be, seeing as how pretty much all of the web's
    programming architecture is based in English words. But it's at least a kind of
    poetic statement about language and creativity, and maybe even a way to help demystify
    the art of coding for others around the world.
