    focused on adventure during the trip that it turns out none of us took a single
    picture in a city setting that I felt was more appropriate for this post. Cheers

    series about repeating a 16,000km roadtrip my parents did with me as a one year-old,
    where I share my reflections about myself and what I saw throughout the trip,
    covering a wide range of topics.

    rate, and the Central Bank rate.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The Central Bank rate has for the longest time been kept extremely low artificially,
    and soon before we went on our trip one dollar equated to something like 350 or
    so pesos in this rate.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The *white* rate, or “official” rate, is what the Argentine peso trades at internationally.
    This hovered around 800 pesos throughout most of our time in Argentina.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You can already see a big difference — 350 pesos to 800\. However, since the
    new president, Milei, took over, the Central Bank rate is now very close to the
    *white* rate.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And then, finally, you have the *blue* rate, which is the parallel market rate.
    Effectively what the dollar trades for “in the streets”, kinda.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When we arrived in Argentina the *blue* rate was 1100 pesos. Yet that doesn’t
    mean you’ll get exactly that if you go to an exchange house (legal or illegal).
    What you get will vary greatly, and can even be influenced by what bills you’re
    planning on exchanging. Hundred dollar bills will get you the best rate, and lower
    denominations will give you lower rates.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To give you have an idea, within the first 2 days in Argentina, I dealt with
    over five different rates. A restaurant actually offered me the proper *blue*
    rate (1100) to pay for the bill, whereas one *cueva* (informal exchange house)
    offered me 1050 and another 1070\. The kiosk where I bought a SIM card from had
    it at 1060, and Uber, who did the currency conversion themselves rather than leaving
    it up to my credit card, did it at 1000.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: On a side note, *cuevas* are an interesting experience in themselves. The first
    one we went to was a recommendation from some people at a cafe and it was an unmarked
    storefront that was shady-ish, whereas the second had exchange written in big
    letters outside, even though I’m still not sure it was entirely legal.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The funniest experience I had in a *cueva* though was in one that a lady from
    the laundry place suggested. It pretended to be a travel agency, with all sorts
    of pictures of trips on the wall and pamphlets advertising tours on the table
    next to the couch. While I was there, a soldier walked in and I tensed up, only
    to realize he was there to exchange money himself.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Anyway, so things get tricky and doing research can save you a fair bit. A lot
    of cards will convert at the official (white) rate for example, which can mean
    you’re taking a hit of over 20% compared to exchanging cash or using some other
    services like Western Union to get pesos (but I won’t get into that here).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Another thing that adds to the complexity is that while I was there, the largest
    denomination of a bill available was 2000 pesos, and those were hard to come by
    as they were new. While 20,000 and 50,000 peso bills are on the way, the vast
    majority of the time I was dealing with 1000-peso bills, which was annoying to
    carry around and pay for things with.

- en: Thus, back to the apartment. Why was I going through all this trouble counting
    up money to pay for the place in cash?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Well, we booked it on *Booking.com* with a set price in dollars, but on arrival
    were told we could pay in cash in both dollars and pesos. However, for reasons
    I still don’t fully comprehend, she offered me the *white* rate if I paid in cash
    with pesos.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When selling dollars, the *white* rate for me is bad, as it means for my one
    dollar I’ll get fewer pesos. However, in this case I was effectively buying dollars,
    and she was offering a fantastic rate.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If this is confusing, let me put it in simpler terms. Let’s use round numbers
    and imagine the price we agreed on for the stay (through *Booking.com*) was 200$.
    I thus came with 200$ in my pocket but was told I could pay the equivalent in
    pesos at the *white* rate, which would mean 160,000 pesos.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So rather than giving her my supposedly equivalent 200$, I go to the *cueva*
    two blocks down and exchange my 200$ at a near-blue rate (say 1070) and get 214,000
    pesos back. I then pay her the 160,000 and still have 54,000 left. (Which, by
    the way, were I to sell, I’d get a rate of maybe 1030 for, meaning I’d still have
    52 or so dollars left.)
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And thus, you can only begin to imagine how complicated day-to-day can get for
    regular Argentinians. You might think they don’t need to deal with all this dollar
    rate BS if they don’t want to, but in reality they kind of do. In some places
    businesses are almost forced to accept dollars and both for businesses and individuals
    ensuring you have dollars is essential for retaining wealth in a country where
    the currency is worth less and less each day.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It also didn’t just stop there. January saw 20% inflation, meaning from the
    day we crossed the border from Uruguay to Argentina to the day we crossed the
    border back to Brazil, about a month later, prices were about 20% higher. Not
    only that, while we were there, the *blue* exchange rate spiked all the way to
    1200 and then back to 1100, with the parallel market keeping up-to-date with it
    daily. Just a few days apart, a hotel exchanged money for us for 1200 while a
    *cueva* quoted me 1050, aiming to take advantage of those not keeping up with
    the rate having gone up from 1100.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That’s the brief summary of the money situation. Overall, it’s very complicated,
    and if you’re looking to visit Argentina soon, it’s worth spending some time researching
    about it.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'In Brazil, there is a frequent rhetoric about “we don’t want to become like
    Argentina” or “this politician will turn us into Argentina”. So I was left wondering:
    how bad is it over there really?'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'And the answer is: I’m still not sure. But I was actually impressed, positively.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We drove all over the country, and stopped in a ton of cities and small towns
    in the North, South, East, and West. We were mostly left with the impression that
    it wouldn’t be so bad to turn into Argentina after all.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As I say this, I need to mention that this of course a subjective experience,
    that is in no way representative of what daily life is for Argentinians.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But while we somehow expected things to feel decadent in some way, they felt
    the opposite of that. Infrastructure was great - we encountered mostly good roads
    and almost always had access to great gas stations. I felt safer in most places
    than I do anywhere in Brazil. Even the tiniest countryside towns were clean and
    well-kept. We also saw very few people in precarious conditions, such as homeless
    or living in bad housing conditions.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And while a valid argument here could be that we just didn’t go to places where
    that is more prevalent, we toured most of the country and didn’t see a fraction
    of the things we openly saw during the time we spent in both Brazil and Chile
    during the trip (which combined was less than Argentina). We *saw* (keyword) a
    lot of extreme poverty in both Chile and Brazil that we did not see in Argentina.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Speaking to locals, the main sense I got is that while a lot of people might
    not necessarily be living in conditions that are supposedly as bad as in other
    places, the vast majority of people are struggling and working hard just to stay
    afloat. There’s also no expectation of a future — the goal is to get by today.
  prefs: []

    poverty actually look like in Argentina?

    have to go on the back burner.

    true on the football field, but it also extends beyond that sometimes.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: However, I must say I had an incredible time in Argentina. The country is absolutely
    stunning, and the people are also fantastic. People were extremely open and friendly,
    and reminded me a lot of home. Asking for directions in the street, filling up
    the tank, ordering food, climbing at the gym, hiking, checking in at the hotel,
    people were always very nice and welcoming.
