    to. She simply had no idea she possessed an utterly amazing, slightly terrifying
    biological gift that scientists would itch to study.

    husband, Les Milne.
  prefs: []

- en: The two met in high school. Les was a 17-year-old swimmer and Joy was 16, a
    new transfer. She remembers dancing with him at a party and being struck by his
    wonderful smell. "He had a lovely male musk smell. He really did," she recalls.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    but had a wicked sense of humor.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    a doctor, Joy became a nurse, and they had three boys. Joy says that as a couple
    they were so easy together — they rarely fought: "We disagreed about things now
    and again, but we didn''t fight, fight."'

    home, and strangely, Joy says, he smelled different. "His lovely male musk smell
    had got this overpowering sort of nasty yeast smell," she says.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    and told him to shower, but that didn't help, and over the weeks and months that
    followed the smell just seemed to grow stronger.

    not washing enough.'' "'

    to shower. He couldn't smell it, he grumbled, and neither could anyone else. "He
    just would stomp off in a huff and say, 'Oh, stop going on about that!' I had
    to just let it go and put up with it," she recalls.

    her husband's smell that was changing.

    — his thoughtfulness, his patience, his quiet dignity — began to bleed away until
    eventually, by his early 40s, she began to see Les as a totally different person.

    things, but it was difficult: the loss of movement, the loss of work, the slow

    ago, they decided to attend a support group for people suffering from Parkinson''s.'

    that Les had — the smell that Joy had first noticed when Les was just 31\. "And
    then I realized for some people it smelled stronger and for other people it didn't
    smell so strong," she says.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    and by the time they arrived, she'd decided she would tell her husband.

    — we both understood the significance. Immediately."'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To begin, this was a new scientific discovery, but also, Joy had smelled the
    disease on Les more than a decade before his symptoms got severe enough for them
    to seek medical help. If Joy could predict Parkinson's before its well-known symptoms,
    such as shaking and sleep disruption, even started to appear, maybe she could
    work with researchers. It might lead to a breakthrough.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    So they went to see a Parkinson's researcher at the University of Edinburgh named
    [Tilo Kunath](http://www.crm.ed.ac.uk/people/tilo-kunath). But initially, he says,
    he wasn't interested.

    "Why should Parkinson''s have an odor? You wouldn''t normally think neurodegenerative
    conditions such as Parkinson''s, or Alzheimer''s, would have an odor."'

    could smell cancer](https://www.fasebj.org/doi/abs/10.1096/fasebj.2019.33.1_supplement.635.10)
    — which of course made him think back to Joy. So he tracked her down and asked
    her to come to his lab for a special test he devised himself.

    who didn't have Parkinson's to take home white T-shirts, wear them overnight and
    then return them.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Then Kunath gave the T-shirts to Joy to smell. "They were all given randomized
    numbers and put in a box, and then she was asked to take each one out and give
    it a score," he says.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    stage of Parkinson's? Something in between? Or maybe the person didn't have the
    disease at all.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    man in the control group, the group without Parkinson's, as having the disease.
    But many months later, Kunath says, that man actually approached him at an event
    and said, "Tilo, you're going to have to put me in the Parkinson's pile because
    I've just been diagnosed."

    in March 2019, listing Joy as a co-author. Their research identified certain specific
    compounds that may contribute to the smell that Joy noticed on her husband and
    other Parkinson's patients.

    Kunath says. Researchers, including [Perdita Barran](https://www.research.manchester.ac.uk/portal/perdita.barran.html)
    at the University of Manchester, led a second, larger study and have recently
    [found 10 compounds](https://chemrxiv.org/articles/Sebum_A_Window_into_Dysregulation_of_Mitochondrial_Metabolism_in_Parkinson_s_Disease/11603613)
    linked to Parkinson's by using mass spectrometry and other techniques to analyze
    samples from 274 people. They're hoping to find a way to diagnose Parkinson's
    from skin-based biomarkers, according to Barran. More work is soon to come, she
    adds.

    early. "We really want to know what is behind this and what are the molecules.
    And then can the molecules be used as some sort of diagnostic test?"'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Parkinson's begins slowly, taking years or maybe even decades before symptoms
    such as tremors appear, Kunath says. "Imagine a society where you could detect
    such a devastating condition before it's causing problems and then prevent the
    problems from even occurring," he adds. Combined with potential therapies to prevent
    or mitigate Parkinson's, a molecular test that identified Parkinson's would be
    a powerful tool.

    presence of a disease, says [Richard Doty](https://www.med.upenn.edu/smellandtastecenter/personnel.html),
    the director of the Smell and Taste Center at the University of Pennsylvania's
    Perelman School of Medicine. "It used to be that physicians did use breath odor
    and other odors to signify certain disorders. But that's not really invoked presently,
    because we have so much better ways of [diagnosing] things." He also says that
    smell is an imperfect biomarker because confounding factors could influence people's
    odors, such as diet and age.

    more than a decade before diagnosis, so maybe, Les told Joy, if they thought very
