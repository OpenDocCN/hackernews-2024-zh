- en: AI chatbots made headlines this week with a range of glaring flubs that were
    hard to look past. Tech companies are rushing to show off their non-offensive,
    error-free AI chatbots. They’re hoping to show investors that the billions of
    dollars spent on this technology was a good investment. This week, AI chatbots
    showed they are not ready for the spotlight just yet.

    turning historically white figures into multiracial characters. The company ended
    up apologizing, and then [pausing its AI image generator’s people-creating feature
    altogether](https://gizmodo.com/google-pauses-gemini-ai-image-generator-white-racism-1851277547)
    to fix it. The embarrassing moment, featured in [The New York Post](https://nypost.com/2024/02/22/opinion/googles-push-to-lecture-us-on-diversity-goes-beyond-ai/)
    Thursday, comes just two weeks after Google’s broader release of Gemini.

    spouting gibberish that briefly rendered the service useless for many users, including
    some reports from businesses using ChatGPT Enterprise. OpenAI later said the problem
    was caused by an “[optimization](https://status.openai.com/incidents/ssg8fh7sfyz3)”
    that introduced a bug, completely throwing off the way ChatGPT generates answers.

    of Adolf Hitler and Osama bin Laden](https://www.wired.com/story/gab-ai-chatbot-racist-holocaust/),
    which deny the Holocaust’s existence. It’s unclear which large language model
    is powering Gab’s AI chatbots at this time. The reach of Gab’s chatbots is far
    smaller than Gemini or ChatGPT, but [CEO Andrew Torba says their users are growing
    by 20,000 people a day](https://gab.com/a/posts/111976587026604595). Gab AI, like
    Grok, is being touted as an alternative to “woke” AI chatbots like Gemini and
    ChatGPT.

    the most [widely embraced AI tool for business](https://gizmodo.com/openai-chatgpt-enterprise-sam-altman-artificial-intelli-1850782245),
    showed how it can be unreliable. It leads to the question, once again, of whether
    AI is being developed too quickly.

    out into the world, but the technology behind them is very new. AI is being tested
    in real-time, in front of everyone, and the pace at which these companies are
    shipping new products is unprecedented. They’ve made great advancements, but some
    pretty big errors as well.

    discipline,” said OpenAI co-founder John Schulman in a [tweet](https://x.com/johnschulman2/status/1760521435242438786?s=20).
    “That said, these public outcries [are] important for spurring us to solve these
    problems and develop better alignment tech,” he said in a follow-up.

    AI efforts, waiting for others to work out the kinks. [Apple is expected to have
    a big AI update sometime in 2024](https://gizmodo.com/apple-big-ai-push-could-come-in-ios-18-analysts-say-1851194215),
    hoping to ship a cleaner product than Gemini and ChatGPT.

    Gemini and ChatGPT will likely have more problems come up in the next year, but
    these companies will have to figure them out in real time in front of everyone.
