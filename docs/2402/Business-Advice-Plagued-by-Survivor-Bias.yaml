    anti-air machine guns and German fighters.

    studied the locations of the bullet holes. Where the planes were hit most, they

    bullets were found in the main cockpit or fuel tanks.'

    the rigor of experimental psychology to the study of the paranormal, and ESP (Extra
    Sensory Perception) in particular. He made waves in the 1930s with controlled
    experiments testing whether a person was able to predict the order of the cards

    measured by significantly above-average performance in a 25-card deck. Those selected

    again and we conclude that such a repeat performance is statistical evidence of
    genuine ESP.

    experiment. I believe some people are “heady” when it comes to coin-flipping—getting
    heads more often than chance alone would suggest. So I put 1000 people in a room
    and tell them to flip a coin ten times. Sure enough, a woman named Margaret makes
    “heads” ten times in a row! The chance of her getting heads ten times in a row
    is only 1-in-1024, so I conclude Margret has special abilities.
  prefs: []

    would flip ten heads in a row is 1-in-1024, but that wasn’t the experiment I ran,
    was it? I let 1000 people flip and “found” Margaret in the crowd.
  prefs: []

- en: The chance that *somebody* in a crowd of a thousand would flip heads ten times
    is a whopping 62%! Because so many people are attempting the feat, some normally-unlikely

    just the one in the crowd who guessed right on the Zener cards three times, and
    there’s no reason to believe I would be successful a fourth time.'

    by Jim Collins, a book that analyzed eleven companies that were mediocre—just
    pooping along—but then transformed themselves into stock market sensations. A
    conclusion was that the common trait was a “culture of discipline.” This book
    has sold many millions of copies, so it’s a good example of popular writing on
    business advice.
