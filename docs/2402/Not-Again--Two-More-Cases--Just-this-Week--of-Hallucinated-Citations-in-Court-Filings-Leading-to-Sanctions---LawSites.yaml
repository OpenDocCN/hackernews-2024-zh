    of the cases to two recent law school grads and an associate who worked on the

    Court of Appeals. His initial filing was deficient in several respects, but after
    the court gave him several deadline extensions, he ultimately filed an appellate
    brief and a reply brief. The respondent moved to strike the brief based on its
    multiple failures to comply with the court’s requirements, among them its failure
    to provide accurate legal citations.

    in response to four separate motions to dismiss. In reviewing the memoranda, Judge
    Brian A. Davis wrote, he noted that the legal citations “seemed amiss.” After
    spending several hours investigating the citations, he was unable to find three
    of the cases cited in two of the memoranda.

    file a written explanation of the origin of the cases.

    citations to multiple cases that “do not exist in reality.” He attributed the

    to “locat[e] relevant legal authorities to support our argument[s].” He apologized
    to the judge for the fake citations and expressed regret for failing to “exercise
