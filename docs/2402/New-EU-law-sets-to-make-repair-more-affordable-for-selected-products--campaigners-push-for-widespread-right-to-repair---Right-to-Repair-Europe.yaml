- en: On Thursday, EU lawmakers reached a deal on new repair rules. In a leap forward,
    the new law supports independent repair and improves consumers’ access to affordable
    repair options, by introducing **rules for reasonable prices for original parts**
    as well as **banning software practices which prevent independent repair and the
    use of compatible and reused spare parts**. Campaigners applaud this as a step
    in the right direction for affordable repair.

    lays down reparability requirements [2]. For these few product categories, producers
    will for the first time be obliged to offer repair options beyond the legal guarantee
    period of two years. Right to Repair Europe demands a broader right to repair
    legislation covering more product categories during the next mandate. Regrettably,
    the current law also fails to offer broader access to more repair information
    and more spare parts, and to prioritise repair within the legal guarantee framework.

    buyback solutions in Member States and harmonised quote/estimations, which will
    increase the visibility of repair options and transparency for their costs. EU
    lawmakers also encourage Member States to introduce repair funds and vouchers,
    which have proven successful as a viable strategy to improve repair affordability.
    Furthermore, small steps were taken to make repair under guarantee more attractive.

- en: The new law mandates sellers to propose repairs if products fail during the
    legal guarantee period, accompanied by a one-year extension of the guarantee after
    repair. While positively received, the incentive might still be perceived as inferior
    next to the offer of replacements. We would have preferred a requirement to repair
    products within the legal guarantee to reduce unnecessary waste.

    quote/estimation called the “European Repair Information Form”, including binding
    information such as the type or repair suggested and its price or, if the precise
    cost cannot be calculated, the applicable calculation method and maximum price
    of repair.

    representing the future of the European repair economy. This is not without thanks
    to the EU Parliament, particularly MEP René Repasi’s tireless efforts against
    pushbacks. The next EU Commission must pick up the baton and keep working on ecodesign
    to secure repairability rules for more products, while national governments must
    introduce repair funds.”'

    refurbishment is a huge step forward in the building of a more circular economy
    in the EU. By opening the after sales markets on the products covered, this text
    will allow consumers to access quality affordable repair. We now need to extend
    this freedom to repair to as many products as possible. We count on the next mandate
    to have an ambitious ecodesign work plan on electronics, which is the fastest
    growing waste stream”.

    prices and improved access to independent repair, we are heading in the right
    direction – but this directive is not enough. It covers only a small group of
    products – many more must still be brought under the ecodesign umbrella before
    we can really speak about a universal right to repair.”
