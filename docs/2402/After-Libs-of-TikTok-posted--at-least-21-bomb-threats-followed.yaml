- en: Last March, police in Coralville, Iowa, investigated a bomb threat targeting
    a junior high school. Authorities brought in specially trained dogs to sniff for
    explosives and started looking into why someone might try to target the community’s
    teachers and students.

    Dvorak from the Coralville Police Department arrived at a theory.

    and her ‘Libs of TikTok’ account,” Dvorak wrote in a report to her superiors.

    But about a day and a half before authorities responded to the threat at Coralville’s
    Northwest Junior High, Raichik [posted](https://twitter.com/libsoftiktok/status/1638288693428363266)
    that the school offers a “pornographic” book in its library that “teaches kids
    about gay sex.”

    — Burbank, California; Minnetonka, Minnesota; Oklahoma City; and Tualatin, Oregon
    — told NBC News they believe Raichik sparked threats in their localities with
    her posts on social media that digitally heckle people such as drag performers,
    LGBTQ teachers and doctors who treat transgender patients. The name "Libs of TikTok"
    is a reference to the people Raichik mocks on social media — "Libs" being short
    for "liberal."

    that Libs of TikTok posts have been used to pick targets.

    institutions singled out by Libs of TikTok later reported bomb threats or other
    violent intimidation. The threats, which on average came several days after tweets
    from Libs of TikTok, targeted schools, libraries, hospitals, small businesses
    and elected officials in 16 states, Washington, D.C., and the Canadian province
    of Ontario. Twenty-one of the 33 threats were bomb threats, which most commonly
    targeted schools and were made via email.
