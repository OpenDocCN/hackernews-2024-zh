  zh: 对于蒙哥马利县的做法感兴趣的议员们称赞，公共拥有的混合收入住房单位从理论上为他们的社区提供了永久的负担得起单位，而不像通过低收入住房税收抵免获得融资的负担得起住房，在15年后可能转变为市场租赁。领导者们还喜欢的是，在一些最初的前期投资后，公共拥有的项目开始为城市自身带来经济回报。

- en: But while housing complexes like The Laureate can offer real relief to struggling
    middle-class tenants — a quarter of The Laureate’s units are restricted to those
    earning 50 percent or lessof the area median income — an outstanding question
    is whether the social housing model could also help those who are lower-income,
    who might require even more deeply subsidized housing.

  zh: 然而，像劳里特这样的住房综合体确实能为挣扎中的中产阶级租户提供真正的帮助 —— 劳里特单位的四分之一只对收入低于该地区中位数收入50%或更少的人士开放
    —— 一个突出的问题是社会住房模式是否也能帮助那些更低收入、可能需要更深度补贴住房的人士。
- en: In Washington, DC, some lawmakers [have been exploring the social housing idea](https://dcist.com/story/24/01/17/dc-social-housing-green-new-deal/),
    and one progressive council member introduced [a bill](https://janeeseward4.com/introducing-green-new-deal-legislation-to-create-social-housing-and-remove-lead-pipes-in-dc/)
    calling to support mixed-income housing accessible to those making 30 percent
    or less of the area’s median income. But critics of the bill say that the rents
    of those living in nonsubsidized units would have to be so high to make that rental
    math work.

  zh: 在华盛顿特区，一些立法者[一直在探索社会住房的想法](https://dcist.com/story/24/01/17/dc-social-housing-green-new-deal/)，而一位进步的市议员提出了[一项法案](https://janeeseward4.com/introducing-green-new-deal-legislation-to-create-social-housing-and-remove-lead-pipes-in-dc/)，呼吁支持混合收入住房，使那些收入低于该地区中位收入30%或更少的人士能够获得住房。但法案的批评者称，非补贴单位的居民租金可能会很高，以使租赁经济学可行。
- en: A housing official speaking on the condition of anonymity told me they think
    it’s okay if the social housing model can only really work to support more middle-class
    tenants in neighborhoods that charge higher rents because leaders still have financing
    tools to build more deeply affordable housing in lower-cost areas. In other words,
    social housing can grow the overall pie of affordable units throughout a city.

  zh: 一位不愿透露姓名的住房官员告诉我，他们认为，如果社会住房模式只能在收租较高的社区中真正为中产阶级租户提供支持，那么领导者们仍然有融资工具来在低成本地区建设更深度负担得起的住房。换句话说，社会住房可以增加城市中所有可负担住房单位的总量。

- en: Marks, from Montgomery County, knows there’s still a lot of stigma and reservations
    about American public housing, which many perceive as being ugly, dirty, or unsafe.
    Few understand that many of the woes of existing public housing in the US have
    had to do with rules Congress passed nearly 100 years ago, such as [restricting
    the housing](https://www.bostonfairhousing.org/timeline/1937-Housing-Act.html)
    to only the very poor. Besides getting [his message out](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/a-county-in-maryland-came-up-with-a-new/id1056200096?i=1000638915229),
