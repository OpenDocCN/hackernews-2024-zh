    places on the internet. An app with a reputation for memes and 30-second dances
    had become the front page of the internet, and it seemed TikTok was only getting
    better as the platform matured. A year later, TikTok’s growth finally appears
    to have plateaued, and while the app is still a cultural behemoth, there’s a surprising
    truth lurking in the app’s success: TikTok is in trouble. In a bid to spread into
    new areas and fend off competitors, TikTok is crowding its app with irksome features,
    pushing content that detracts from the app’s core experience, and alienating its
    base of once-loyal users. Social media success is a delicate balance, and if TikTok
    isn’t careful, it could destroy itself from the inside out.'

    The company is pushing its eCommerce so hard you hear about it more than any other
    topic on the app, both in ads and organic videos from creators hoping for a share
    of the profits. The app is even testing a new feature that uses AI to identify
    products in the background of regular content and [turn every single video into

    is reportedly preparing to allow users to [post 30-minute videos](https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/29/24054906/tiktok-youtube-horizontal-videos-creators)
    and prompting creators to [upload horizontal content](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/01/31/tiktok-videos-horizontal-vertical/)
    instead of the app’s standard vertical format. TikTok is even encouraging people
    to upload photo slideshows instead of videos altogether. On top of that, TikTok
    just [fumbled a relationship with Universal Music Group](https://gizmodo.com/record-label-tiktok-exploiting-artists-is-their-job-1851213258),
    which pulled its music catalog off the platform and silenced any video featuring
    Taylor Swift, the Weeknd, and every other Universal artist.

    is slowing down,” Jasmine Enberg, a Principal Social Media Analyst at Insider
    Intelligence. “There’s a ceiling to short-video ad monetization and the pivot
    to longer videos could help boost its ad revenues. But TikTok spearheaded the
    short-video revolution, and it risks straying from its core use case of fun, entertaining
    clips and losing its edge.”

    Enberg表示。“短视频广告变现存在上限，而转向更长的视频可能有助于提升其广告收入。但TikTok率先推动了短视频革命，却面临着远离其核心用例——有趣、娱乐的视频片段，可能失去竞争优势。”
- en: Instagram is only just starting to recover from making the same mistakes. Rather
    than focus on the image-sharing experience that made the app famous, Instagram
    made a full-blown pivot to videos through its Reels feature back in 2022, and
    tweaked its algorithm to show more content from accounts that users weren’t following.
    The company might have been right; according to Instagram CEO Adam Mosseri, data
    showed that video is what users wanted to see. But Instagram pushed Reels so hard
    and so quickly it sparked an international backlash campaign spearheaded by Kim
    Kardashian, who called for the app to “[Make Instagram Instagram Again](https://gizmodo.com/make-instagram-again-meme-kylie-jenner-tati-bruening-1849348057).”
    The app had its own doomed experiment with selling products as well, promoting
    the Instagram Shopping page so hard it replaced the “Post” button with a link
    to the app’s built-in store. Instagram Shopping was such a failure the company
    [shut it down entirely](https://gizmodo.com/instagram-removing-shop-tab-app-redesign-reels-1849966938).

  zh: Instagram刚开始从犯下相同错误中复苏。Instagram没有专注于让该应用程序闻名的图片分享体验，而是在2022年通过其Reels功能全面转向视频，并调整了其算法以显示用户未关注的帐户的更多内容。也许公司是正确的；根据Instagram首席执行官亚当·莫瑟里的数据显示，用户想要看到的是视频内容。但Instagram如此迅速且如此大力地推广Reels，引发了国际性的反击运动，由金·卡戴珊发起，呼吁该应用程序“[再次让Instagram成为Instagram](https://gizmodo.com/make-instagram-again-meme-kylie-jenner-tati-bruening-1849348057)”。该应用程序还进行了自己注定失败的产品销售实验，大力推广Instagram购物页面，以至于用于发布的“发布”按钮被应用程序内置商店的链接替换。Instagram购物如此失败，以至于公司完全关闭了它。
- en: 'The result was a minor exodus of users and a major drop in Instagram’s cultural
    clout. The problem was bad enough that The Atlantic ran a story with the headline
    declaring “[Instagram Is Over](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2022/11/instagram-tiktok-twitter-social-media-competition/672305/).”
    As time wore on it seems Meta has stuck the landing, but only through abandoning
    or at least retooling the projects that were alienating users. Instagram honed
    its Reels product, ditched its shop, and embarked on a PR campaign promising that
    the app was hearing and responding to complaints. Perhaps those changes were necessary
    to compete with the rise of TikTok, but Instagram’s flop era proved the old saying
    is true: when you try to be everything to everyone, you become nothing to anyone.'

  zh: 结果是用户的轻微外流和Instagram文化影响力的显著下降。问题严重到足以使《大西洋月刊》刊登了一篇标题为“[Instagram已经结束](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2022/11/instagram-tiktok-twitter-social-media-competition/672305/)”的报道。随着时间的推移，似乎Meta公司已经解决了问题，但这仅通过放弃或至少重新调整正在疏远用户的项目实现。Instagram完善了其Reels产品，放弃了其商店，并启动了一场公关活动，承诺应用程序正在倾听并回应投诉。也许这些变化是为了应对TikTok的崛起而必要的，但Instagram的失误时代证明了这句老话的真实性：当你试图迎合所有人时，你最终什么都不是。
- en: It’s ironic that TikTok doesn’t seem to have learned the lessons that its own
    success taught Instagram. Then again, TikTok’s bets could pay off. Instagram users
    adapted to reels after some tweaks. TikTokers could get used to longer videos
    if creators succeed with the format, though that would amount to a tectonic shift
    in the content that defines the platform.

    cases, platforms backtrack on changes, but it usually takes an outcry from high-profile

- en: TikTok didn’t respond to a request for comment, but, of course, the company’s
    leadership would tell you the app is on the right course, even if there’s turbulence
    along the way. The TikTok shop is worth alienating some users if it turns into
    a major eCommerce business. Abandoning short-form videos is a good bet if the
    push towards longer content helps the company rival YouTube in any meaningful
    way. If there’s anything Steve Jobs taught the tech industry, it’s that consumers
    don’t always know what they actually want.

  zh: 抖音没有回应评论请求，但当然，公司领导层会告诉你，即使路途中存在波折，应用仍然在正确的道路上。如果抖音商店能转变为一个主要的电子商务业务，放弃一些用户可能是值得的。如果向长内容推进能够帮助公司在任何有意义的方式上与YouTube竞争，那么放弃短视频是一个明智的赌注。如果有什么史蒂夫·乔布斯教给科技行业的，那就是消费者并不总是知道他们实际想要什么。
- en: Along the way, TikTok may lose the cool factor that apps enjoy in the early
    stages of social media dominance if it hasn’t already. That’s inevitable, and
    becoming uncool isn’t a death sentence if you can maintain a core set of services
    that keeps users coming back. The app has a massive lead, but if TikTok doesn’t
    stick the landing, its competitors are ready to pounce.

  zh: 在这过程中，如果抖音还没有失去社交媒体初期主导地位的炫酷因素，那将是不可避免的。如果你能保持一套核心服务，吸引用户回流，失去潮流不是致命的。该应用有着巨大的领先优势，但如果抖音不能稳固地站稳脚跟，竞争对手随时准备发动攻击。
