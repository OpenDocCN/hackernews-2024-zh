    on mathematics. For the first chunk of the 20th century, mathematicians were obsessed
    with formalizing mathematics and then proving meta-theorems *about* those formal
    systems. In particular, there was a strongly-held belief that for any well-formed
    formula (a “grammatically correct” statement in math, e.g., A=B is well-formed
    whereas AA==+B is not), you could use mathematics to *decide* whether it was true
    or false.

    a more powerful mathematical system. Once a system becomes sufficiently complex,
    there will always be statements which are undecidable. You’re left with a choice:
    either have weak system of mathematics or accept that there will always be theorems
    out of reach. A rough analogy to incompleteness Heisenberg’s Uncertainty Principle,
    which shows that physics makes it impossible to determine *both* the position
    and velocity of a particle with exact precision.'

  zh: 不！哥德尔在1931年证明了数学是不可判定的，这是颠覆性的结果。他证明了数学中存在一些陈述，在该系统内是*真实的但无法被证明*。更糟糕的是，事实证明你无法建立一个更强大的数学系统。一旦一个系统变得足够复杂，就会始终存在无法判定的陈述。你只能在弱点的数学系统或接受总有定理是无法达到的这两个选择。这与不完备性的类比粗略地类似于海森堡不确定性原理，它显示出物理学使得不可能准确确定粒子的*位置和速度*。
- en: Wouldn’t it be nice if every question had an answer? That’s a lovely fantasy,
    but Gödel shows that there are **fundamental epistemic limits to the universe**,
    things that no genius will help us to know, no alien race could teach us, no machine
    could be built to solve, and no new kinds of mathematics will uncover. How frustrating.

- en: A key feature of powerful mathematical systems (or perhaps, any system that
    generates complexity…) is that they involve **self-reference**, that is, they
    contain ways of talking about themselves. “This sentence is true” is an example.
    Because self-referential systems can manipulate and talk about themselves, they
    systems are very powerful and immediately run into fun paradoxes. Is the statement
    “This sentence is false.” true or false? Either way, it doesn’t end well.

  zh: 强大的数学系统的一个关键特征是它们涉及**自指性**，也就是说，它们包含了描述自身的方式。“这个句子是真的”就是一个例子。因为自指系统能操纵并谈论它们自己，它们就非常强大，立刻就会遇到有趣的悖论。“这个句子是假的。”这个陈述到底是真还是假呢？无论如何，结局都不太好。
- en: A third major theme of the book is **isomorphism**, which is unique to Hofstadter’s
    vernacular. In formal mathematics, “isomorphism” takes on a version of “equivalence.”
    For example, it turns out that many different formalizations of mathematics are
    provably isomorphic, like Turing Machines, arithmetic, set theory, and formal
    logic. Hofstadter deliberately uses the term more loosely to describe two systems
    that are structurally similar. I find this quite useful because it forces one
    to define the structures of the system, why they are similar, and why other parts
    of the system are less important. We might describe the way that planets fly around
    stars as *isomorphic* to the way that electrons fly around nuclei.

  zh: 书中的第三个主要主题是**同构性**，这在霍夫斯塔德的术语中是独一无二的。在正式的数学中，“同构性”承担了“等价性”的一个版本。例如，证明了许多不同形式的数学都可以被证明是同构的，比如图灵机、算术、集合论和形式逻辑。霍夫斯塔德故意更宽泛地使用这个术语来描述两个结构相似的系统。我觉得这非常有用，因为它迫使人定义系统的结构，为什么它们相似，以及为什么系统的其他部分不那么重要。我们可以描述行星绕着恒星飞行的方式*同构*于电子绕着原子核飞行的方式。

- en: The two minor characters, [M.C.Escher](https://mcescher.com/) and [Johann Sebastian
    Bach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Sebastian_Bach), are reflections of
    Gödel in art and both liberally use self reference. Escher draws pictures of hands
    drawing hands (!) and water “falling” in an infinite loop. His images don’t just
    play tricks on the eye, they force paradoxical conclusions, regardless of your
    angle of interpretation. On the musical side, Papa Bach was most famous for his
    complex fugues, which are basically the same melody played on top of each other.
    Common versions of this you might have sung as a child are “Row, row, row your
    boat” and “Frère Jacques.” Both Escher and Bach are woven into the story (like
    a fugue?), providing tangible examples to the more abstruse mathematical concepts.

    deal with a whole range of bizarre situations, like record player so powerful
    that it can play any record (including a record that can destroy the record player)
    and asking a Djinn for a meta-wish (“I wish for 5 more wishes”). Hofstadter’s
    greatest achievement is his palindromic Crab Canon in Chapter VII, which is a
    dialog that can be read backwards and forwards. Of course, these aren’t just cute
    dialogs: each is isomorphic to the themes in the following chapter. Oftentimes
    a dialog is a more understandable exposition of the chapter’s theme than the chapter
    itself.'

- en: And, naturally in a book about self-reference, GEB itself is highly self-referential.
    Themes are often resolved hundreds of pages later and require going back to appreciate
    fully the depth of Hofstadter’s argument. Mercifully, he’s a gifted and lucid
    writer so, even though there are chapters that are dense, it’s always tractable
    to read.

- en: '[I recently joined Stand Together](/moving-from-com-to-org-34150bea9ade), who
    shares my strong belief in **bottom up solutions**. Perhaps the idea that bottom
    up solutions are better isn’t just an empirical statement of sociology, but fundamental
    to the nature of complex systems. Indeed, Hofstadter goes through many examples
    of how complexity emerges from simpler systems, often which look nothing like
    the higher-level systems. Consciousness itself doesn’t exist in neurons, and yet
    neurons as a system create consciousness in humans (this is critical to Hoftstadter’s
    argument that machines can think). There’s also a fantastical example in a dialog
    with the Anteater, who has conversations with Aunt Hilary, an ant colony. She
    is perfectly capable of having a robust conversation with the Anteater, powered
    by the ants in the colony. Of course, the ants themselves are individuals with
    their own cares and concerns and has no knowledge of the emergent intelligence,
    much like Aunt Hilary has no knowledge of her inner workings.'

    Hilary 婶婶进行对话，而 Hilary 婶婶则来自蚂蚁群。她完全能够与蚂蚁熊进行充分的交流，这是由蚂蚁群中的蚂蚁驱动的。当然，蚂蚁本身是有着自己关注和关心的个体，并且对

    An additional tenet of Stand Together is “believe in people,” which means that

- en: The idea that epistemic limits exist in something as universal as mathematics
    has humbled me about the limits of knowledge for complex human systems. Utopian
    thought experiments often generate useful frames of exploration, but ought not
    be confused with reality. Utopians often try to pull out the “bugs” from human
    systems, often which are endemic to the system, or “features,” as we might say
    in the trade. Bugs might not be desirable, but sometimes, *the bugs can’t just
    be ripped out of the system without destroying the system itself*. Our time would
    be better spent figuring out—within the system—optimize for minimizing the downsides
    of the “bugs” while maximizing the value of the features. Think about this with
    respect to capitalism, socialism, and communism…

- en: A final area where GEB has influenced me is in designing software products.
    Hugh Dubberly has been my collaborator for years, starting off with our deep dive
    into cybernetics, the study of feedback loops. We believe that iteration is key
    to quality; perfection is impossible out of the gate. Further, the system used
    to generate quality software is a series of feedback loops between customers and
    the company, product and engineering, and so on. Though specific product frameworks
    have changed over the years, that obsession with iteration and feedback permeates
    everything I’ve implemented.
