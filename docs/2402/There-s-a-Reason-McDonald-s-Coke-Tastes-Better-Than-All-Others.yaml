    But if you have had the pleasure of slurping down a Coke under the Golden Arches,
    then you already know the secret: Coke from McDonald''s tastes better than cola
    from any other fast food joint, or even soda from the bottle.'

- en: That delicious secret isn't happenstance. It's for very specific reasons. McDonald's
    has a really smart storage tactic and brilliant drink mixing strategy that makes
    their Coca-Cola stand out. Read on to find out why Coca-Cola from McDonald's simply
    can't be topped.

- en: While most fast food restaurants have their Coca-Cola syrup delivered to them
    in plastic bags, McDonald's gets their syrup specially delivered in stainless
    steel tanks. The special tanks keep the syrup fresh and protect it from light,
    temperature, air, and anything else that might take away from its delicious flavor.
    Sadly, the plastic bags do no such thing.

    had since 1955\. Ray Kroc, the man behind the Golden Arches food giant, asked
    Coca-Cola to partner with him. Coca-Cola agreed, and the rest is history.

- en: No matter what McDonald's you go to, the Coke will always taste the same. That's
    because McDonald's filtration system is top tier. McDonald's filters its water
    before they add it to the soda fountain, so it guarantees your Coke will always
    taste fresh—even if the water that they start with isn't great quality.

    the sodas as they're dispensed. So, they come out cool, but never *cold*. Not
    McDonald's, though.

- en: McDonald's pre-chills their syrup before placing it in the machine. So while
    other fast food restaurants are leaving their soda syrup bags out in the kitchen,
    McDonald's syrup is getting chilly and ready for your cup.

- en: Plus, McDonald's sets their machines for a syrup-to-water ratio that accounts
    for melting ice. Which means there's a little more syrup than most other fast-food
    restaurants. This ensures that your Coke won't water down and that it's just as
    good on sip number one as it is on sip number 21.

- en: Not only does McDonald's pre-chill the soda syrup, but they also pre-chill the
    filtered water that is going into the machine. There is an insulated tube that
    runs from the fridge in the back to the soda fountain in the front that constantly
    keeps the water at a temperature just above freezing.

    With more CO2, your pop will stay crisp and bubbly and keep its carbonation for
    longer, so you shouldn't have to worry about a flat Coke.

    it''s designed like this so that all the Coke can hit your tastebuds. But maybe
    it''s a sales tactic so we''ll drink it all and want to get another one—because
    who can go to McDonald''s and not order a medium fry (or large, I don''t judge)
    and not need a crisp, cool Coke to slurp it down.'
