- en: Since the moment the Apple Vision Pro was announced, people have joked that
    it was a device that some people would primarily use for porn. Now that it has
    been released, a certain segment of its customer base is very disappointed to
    learn that current VR porn does not work on the $3,500 headset. Top minds are
    on the case trying to figure out how to fix this.

    subreddit ‚Äú[Anyone figured out porn on the Vision Pro?](https://www.reddit.com/r/oculusnsfw/comments/1ahffm0/anyone_figured_out_porn_on_the_vision_pro/?ref=404media.co)
    Dying to get this to work haha, if anyone has a success story please tell me how.‚Äù
    The top comment on this thread is ‚Äú3500$ chastity belt. ü§°ü§°ü§°ü§°ü§°ü§°‚Äù Oculus NSFW subreddit
    is the largest VR porn subreddit, with employees of many studios who make immersive
    VR porn active in the community. The general consensus in that thread is that,
    while the Vision Pro can play ‚Äúflat‚Äù porn videos on sites like PornHub, there
    is currently not an easy way to play 180 degree side-by-side videos on the Vision
    Pro, which is how most commercial VR porn is filmed.
