- en: According to a [report by *The Verge*](https://www.theverge.com/2023/2/28/23619730/meta-vr-oculus-ar-glasses-smartwatch-plans),
    citing an internal Meta presentation held today, the company has sold nearly 20
    million Quest headsets. This likely includes Quest 1, Quest 2, and Quest Pro,
    though by all accounts Quest 2 appears to be the vast majority. And while the
    figure wasn’t publicly announced, this would be the first official confirmation
    of Quest unit sales from the company.

    any other single VR headset maker—Rabkin went on to stress that the company has
    to do a better job at keeping customers using the headsets well after their purchase.

    need to be better at social and actually make those things more reliable, more
    intuitive so people can count on it.”

    those that bought in early.

    Verge*. “And sadly, the newer cohorts that are coming in—the people who bought
    it this last Christmas—they’re just not as into it [or engaged as] the ones who
    bought it early.”
