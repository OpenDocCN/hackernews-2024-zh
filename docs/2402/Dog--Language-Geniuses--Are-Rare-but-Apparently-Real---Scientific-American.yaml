    owner has likely noticed, though, some dogs—like some people—are sharper than
    others. And a few might even be, in canine terms, geniuses. As researchers describe
    today in *Scientific Reports*, certain dogs are capable of learning the names
    for [more than 100 different toys](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-47864-5).
    Remarkably, most of the dogs in the study seemed to do this spontaneously, without
    any special training from humans.

  zh: 狗经常进入全球十大最聪明动物的名单。然而，正如任何宠物主人可能注意到的那样，有些狗——就像有些人一样——比其他人更聪明。在狗的层面上，有些甚至可能是天才。正如研究人员今天在《科学报告》中描述的那样，某些狗能够学习超过[100种不同玩具的名称](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-47864-5)。值得注意的是，研究中的大多数狗似乎是自发地做到这一点的，没有接受过任何人类的特殊训练。

    paper’s lead author Shany Dror, a doctoral candidate in ethology at Eötvös Loránd
    University in Hungary. “Someone says, ‘Pizza,’ and their dog suddenly comes with
    the pizza toy.”

- en: Language is integral to how human beings think, communicate and collectively
    function, yet questions abound about the evolutionary origins of this behavior.
    Comparing and contrasting other species’ abilities to comprehend words and phrases
    can be a useful method for learning more about how human language came to be.
    Most of these studies to date have focused on apes or dolphins, but results can
    be complicated by the fact that such investigations have often involved animals
    in captivity instead of in the wild.

- en: Yet at some point, she continues, babies learn to talk, while puppies do not.
    Only a few researchers have tried to explore the origin of that difference. In
    2004 scientists at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig,
    Germany, reported that [a border collie named Rico](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15192233/)
    knew the words for more than 200 different items. In the nearly 20 years since
    the paper on Rico was published, however, researchers outside of Dror’s group
    have only found six dogs that demonstrated similar abilities, which has limited
    the scope of studies that have been performed.

  zh: 然而，她继续说，婴儿在某个时候学会说话，而小狗却没有。只有少数研究人员尝试探索这种差异的起源。2004年，德国莱比锡马克斯·普朗克进化人类学研究所的科学家报告称，名为Rico的边境牧羊犬知道200多种不同物品的名称。然而，在Rico论文发表近20年后，除了Dror组外的研究人员仅发现了六只表现类似的狗，这限制了已进行的研究范围。
- en: Dror, who is also a professional dog trainer, wanted to expand the field by
    finding more dogs with an aptitude for language. First, she tried to train 34
    dogs from typical households to [learn a set of vocabulary words](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-93581-2).
    “That was a miserable failure,” she says. “We all worked really hard, but after

  zh: Dror，一位专业的狗训练师，希望通过寻找更多有语言天赋的狗来扩展这一领域。首先，她试图训练34只来自普通家庭的狗学习一组词汇（https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-93581-2）。她说：“那是一次悲惨的失败。我们都非常努力，但是三个月后，它们甚至连两个玩具的名字都不知道。”
- en: So rather than trying to teach dogs, she decided to [put out a call for owners](https://geniusdogchallenge.com/how-to-apply/)
    of particularly astute canines to come forward. She and her colleagues also launched
    the “[Genius Dog Challenge](https://geniusdogchallenge.com/the-challenge/),” a
    live YouTube-broadcasted game that pits smart dogs against one another to see
    which possesses the greatest linguistic prowess. After five years, the researchers
    identified 41 “gifted word learner dogs,” or ones that knew the names of at least
    five toys. The dogs came from nine different countries on three continents and
    included a range of breeds. More than half were border collies, but the team also
    documented language abilities in a few mixed-breed and purebred dogs, including
    three Labradors, two Pomeranians, and a Pekingese, Shih Tzu, corgi, toy poodle,
    German shepherd, and cross between an Australian cattle dog and a miniature Australian
    shepherd.

- en: When Dror first gathered the data, which were validated on video calls online,
    the 41 dogs knew an average of 29 words for toys, and the top performer among
    them knew 86\. From that baseline, the dogs demonstrated an “amazing” learning
    speed, Dror says, with owners reporting that dogs needed only five minutes or
    so to learn a new toy. Proving that old dogs—or at least older dogs—*can* learn
    new tricks, the canines continued to expand their vocabulary over the years. By
    the time the researchers were finalizing their new paper, 16 owners reported that
    their dogs now knew the names of more than 100 toys.

    average dogs. The animals in the study were very motivated to play with toys and
    also paid close attention when their owners spoke. But as Dror points out, these
    are hardly unique traits among dogs. She suspects that dogs’ early rearing environment,
    combined with some form of natural talent, plays a role in whether they become
    gifted word learners, but “we still do not know the elements that compose each
    of these factors and how the two interact,” she says.

- en: Irene Pepperberg, a comparative psychologist at Boston University, who was not
    involved in the research, says that it’s interesting to see in the study that
    not all working dogs—or those bred to be herders, hunters or trackers—can become
    gifted word learners. Yet almost all gifted word learners are working breeds.
    Those include the obvious breeds such as shepherds and labs but also less obvious
    ones such as poodles, which were used in militaries in the 17th century through
    World War II, and Pomeranians, which were originally bred as watchdogs. “At least
    until recently, when beauty standards have evolved and probably affected the gene
    pool, breeds were carefully selected to learn and respond to aspects of human
    speech over thousands of years,” Pepperberg says.

    factors that contribute to certain dogs’ talent for language and examine how the
    animals’ approach to learning is similar or different to that of human children.

    their dog may be a genius to reach out. “We’re always interested in meeting new
    dog owners and meeting their dogs,” she says.
