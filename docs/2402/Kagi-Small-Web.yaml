    but we rarely bump into each other, right? Kagi's all about humanizing the web
    and we want to help surface the people behind the posts and stories that zip by.
    This less known corner of the web is also known as the "small web". Read more
    in our [blog post](https://blog.kagi.com/small-web).

    days to keep it fresh. Feel like saying thanks or jotting down a thought? Use
    'Appreciation' and 'Notes'. They'll be around for about a week, but hey, it's
    a way to say "hi" to someone else out here.
