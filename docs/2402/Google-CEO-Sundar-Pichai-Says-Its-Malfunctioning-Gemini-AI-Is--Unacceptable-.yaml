    in the Gemini app (formerly Bard),” Pichai said in the memo, which was first reported
    by [Semafor](https://www.semafor.com/article/02/27/2024/google-ceo-sundar-pichai-calls-ai-tools-responses-completely-unacceptable)
    and later confirmed by [The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/28/24085445/google-ceo-gemini-ai-diversity-scandal-employee-memo).
    “I know that some of its responses have offended our users and shown bias—to be
    clear, that’s completely unacceptable and we got it wrong.”

    the issues in Gemini and had “seen substantial improvement on a wide range of
    prompts.” Gemini’s image generator caused an online firestorm last week after
    the AI chatbot created [historically inaccurate images of Black Vikings](https://gizmodo.com/google-anti-woke-babies-gemini-black-vikings-1851275422)
    and refused to generate images of white people.

    of any particular group. And we did not want it to create inaccurate historical—or
    any other—images,” Raghavan said in a [blog post](https://blog.google/products/gemini/gemini-image-generation-issue/).

- en: While Raghavan’s statement was meant for the public, Pichai’s memo was addressed
    to employees, some of whom may have been taken aback by Gemini’s outputs. One
    person who [claims to work at Google’s AR & VR unit](https://x.com/stratejake/status/1760333904857497650?s=20)
    in San Francisco said they had “never been so embarrassed to work for a company”
    when Gemini’s historically inaccurate images of a medieval British king went viral.
    Gizmodo has not been able to independently confirm whether this person works at
    Google.

    the situation with Gemini didn’t repeat itself. He also stressed that it was important
    for Google to give users “helpful, accurate, and unbiased” information about all
    its products, including its emerging AI products.

    but we know the bar is high for us and we will keep at it for however long it
    takes. And we’ll review what happened and make sure we fix it at scale,” Pichai
    said.
