    about plastic recycling, one might have expected the environmentalist non-profit
    to encourage the practice. Anyone raised in the late-20th and early-21st century
    knows that the term "recycle" is often synonymous with "environmentalist causes."

    For those who can recycle, they should understand what can and can’t go in their
    recycling bin by contacting their local waste manager. For those who currently
    can’t recycle at home or work, they should advocate for better access to recycling
    services by contacting local community leaders and local government officials.

    to reduce personal waste."'

    Act is an example of legislation that could implement real solutions, such as
    reducing and banning non-recyclable or easily replaced single-use plastics and
    establishing programs to support reuse and refill efforts. However, for such measures
    to be successful, the plastics industry must not be allowed to perpetuate the
