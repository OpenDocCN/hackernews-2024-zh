# Kagi Search Changelog

> 来源：[https://kagi.com/changelog#3179](https://kagi.com/changelog#3179)

### Announcements

Starting from **March 26th**, we will **begin including localized sales tax for all new customers** who subscribe on or after this date.

Starting from **April 9th, all existing customers who qualify for sales tax/VAT will see localized sales tax/VAT added to their monthly invoice in USD**, on top of their current subscription fee. This adjustment will appear on your next invoice on or after April 9th, with no immediate extra charge.

If you are paying with an **alternative method via Paypal, OpenNode, or any other non-Stripe provider**: You will be prompted to pick a sales tax region the next time you go to purchase credit.

If you have any questions about this change, please feel free to contact our team through [Discord](https://discord.gg/5V7qcs3X88) or at [support@kagi.com](mailto:support@kagi.com). We will be building an F.A.Q. page to answer any questions about the migration process.

To clarify, it means an end-price increase for affected members (sales tax/VAT will be automatically added on top of Kagi price, if applicable in your country/state) and this is mandated by Kagi becoming large enough to have legal sales tax/VAT obligation. In addition, Kagi will have to retroactively pay for all sales tax/VAT that we did not collect in the last almost two years. We have chosen to absorb this on behalf of our customers.
