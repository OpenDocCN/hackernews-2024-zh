- en: I’ve been a lifelong Windows user since the 90s and even MS-DOS back in the
    80s, but things are changing. I’ve been using other operating systems more and
    more. MacOS and Linux are getting mixed into my workflow more and Windows less.
    Why? Microsoft is actively angering it power users by removing features. By trying
    to simplify Windows they are actively making administering it worse.

- en: Microsoft is in a panic from the continued loss of it’s user base. They are
    making some improvements like the GUI and cleaning up other elements that give
    a more cohesive look. No more mixing Metro UI and Legacy panels like Windows 10\.
    While this is good on the surface, they aren’t fixing anything. In fact, things
    are about to get much worse with the removal of these panels. On Tuesday, I had
    a printer issue at a client site and I was going to pull up the “Devices and Printers”
    panel to manage the drives and printing default settings. In the most recent 22H2
    Windows 11 update, they hid it!

    this company is still using legacy code from the 90s in spots and just slapping
    in new coat of paint on top of it every 5 years when they need to extract more
    money from its users.

    sabotaging it’s users. MacOS is bland and hasn’t changed in years, while Linux
    has a technical barrier of entry with little support. Yet, both of these options
    are better than modern Windows unless you need Gaming. However, Steam with it’s
    steamdeck might be changing the game&mldr;
