    is one of EFF’s *biggest* concerns, and as an organization we have grown by leaps
    and bounds over the last two decades because *more and more people care*. Some
    people say that Americans have given up on privacy. But if you look at actual

    overwhelmingly support new privacy protections. In general, the country has [grown
