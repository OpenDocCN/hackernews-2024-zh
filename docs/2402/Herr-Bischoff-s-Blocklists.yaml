- en: Feel free to use the following lists without restriction and without guarantees
    or warranties of any kind. I will do my best to keep it updated but that's about
    it. They are refreshed at the given intervals, so fetching more often than that
    just wastes resources. Excessive queries will eventually get you blocked but usually
    not added to the lists themselves. Just be kind and considerate and everything
    else will follow.

    that don't have an ASN to IP range converter built-in and you just don't want
    to bother with writing your own. It contains both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses, so
    you will either have to use it as-is or filter it yourself.

- en: The ASNs these IPs belong to are beyond saving. They have significant issues
    with abusive traffic and content. Some are actively involved in contact scraping.
    The operators are either unable to manage it or simply don't care. Likely, there's
    some incentive involved for them to not care or they are flat-out spam operators
    themselves. Some may even be bullet-proof hosters for despicable material and
    actions. Anyway, they need to be blocked by default and I do so for the infrastructure
    I'm responsible for.
