- en: Using passkeys likely means having a different mindset from how you think about
    passwords. There’s nothing to remember when you log in, and you have to use something
    else to store your passkeys. Passkeys can be stored in Apple’s, Google’s or Microsoft’s
    password manager systems; your browser; a dedicated password manager; or on a
    [physical security key](https://www.wired.com/story/google-titan-security-key-passkeys/).
    I created a Google passkey on one USB key, and all I need to do to sign in is,
    essentially, plug it in. (All of the devices I use professionally and personally
    are Apple, meaning I haven’t tested passkeys between my iPhone and a Windows laptop,
    for instance.)

    FIDO Alliance says. Over the past year, the FIDO alliance has also been [working
    on user experience guidelines](https://fidoalliance.org/ux-guidelines/), he says,
    making it more straightforward for people to sign up and use passkeys across systems.
    Gary Orenstein, the chief customer officer of password manager Bitwarden, says
    there are multiple groups involved in the creation and rollout of passkeys, so
    transitioning to a world where everything is seamless takes coordination. “The
    standards are at one level, user expectations are at a different level,” he says.
    “The vendor implementations are at a third level, and they’re merging, but it
    takes time.”

    and means you aren’t locked in to Google’s, Microsoft’s, or Apple’s ecosystems.
    However, where you save a passkey is going to take some remembering. When setting
    up one passkey, I was asked by my password manager, browser, and the device operating
    system whether I wanted to save my passkey with each of them. Picking one spot
    and sticking to it is probably the best option.

- en: 'Most of my work is done on my laptop—and it''s rare that I download new apps
    or log out of apps on my phone—so I have been saving the majority of my passkeys
    in Bitwarden, which costs me $10 a year for a premium account alongside my hundreds
    of passwords. It works like this: When logging in to my Amazon account, I enter
    my username, and then Bitwarden’s browser extension pops up asking whether I want
    to log in with my passkey for Amazon. I press confirm, and I am logged in. It
    also offers the option to use my device or a hardware key to log in, and if I
    select one of these options, it looks for passkeys stored on my laptop.'

    meaning that to get the mobile-first Coinbase integration to work, I ended up
    saving that passkey to iCloud’s Keychain instead. Orenstein, from Bitwarden, says
    that making passkeys work on mobile is a priority for Bitwarden and more support
    should be rolling out in the coming months. The company has seen a “fantastic”
    adoption of passkeys so far, he says, but acknowledges people will have to get
    used to the change. “You still need an awareness about where it is,” Orenstein
    says. “I think, over time, as an industry, we can reduce the need for that awareness,
    hopefully to zero.”

  zh: 然而，正如前面提到的，Bitwarden目前在移动设备上尚未提供通行密钥功能，这意味着为了使移动优先的Coinbase集成正常工作，我不得不将该通行密钥保存到iCloud的钥匙串中。Bitwarden的Orenstein表示，使通行密钥在移动设备上正常工作是Bitwarden的优先任务，未来几个月将会有更多的支持推出。他说，公司迄今已见证了通行密钥的“极好”采用情况，但承认人们需要适应这种变化。“你仍然需要意识到它的存在位置，”Orenstein说。“我认为随着时间的推移，作为一个行业，我们可以将这种意识的需求减少，希望最终达到零。”

    say that businesses they’ve interviewed are generally positive about the adoption
    of passkeys and the extra security it will bring. However, it will likely take
    some time until the majority of websites, apps, and companies are using passkeys
    for everything. “I don’t think we will have a big bang in the next few months,”
    Lassak says. “It’s going to be a slow process, which on the way will then also
    catch other and smaller entities.”

    until I have converted my remaining 320-ish accounts to be using passkeys. And

    have existing passwords that I can fall back on. “Passkeys is having fewer passwords,
