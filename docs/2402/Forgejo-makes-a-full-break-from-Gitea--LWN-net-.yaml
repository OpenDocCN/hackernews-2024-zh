- en: The world of open-source "[forges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forge_(software))"
    is becoming a little more fragmented. The [Forgejo](https://forgejo.org/) project
    is a software-development platform that started as a "<q>soft</q>" fork of [Gitea](https://about.gitea.com/)
    in late 2022\. On February 16, Forgejo [announced](https://forgejo.org/2024-02-forking-forward/)
    its intent to become a "<q>hard fork</q>" of Gitea to continue its stated objectives
    of community-controlled development and to "<q>liberate software development from
    the shackles of proprietary tools</q>". In a world where proprietary tools cast
    a long shadow over open-source development those are welcome words—if the project
    can deliver.

    Gitea itself is a fork of [Gogs](https://gogs.io/) that [started](https://blog.gitea.com/welcome-to-gitea/)
    in December 2016 due to frustration with the "<q>single-maintainer management
    model of Gogs</q>" and opted for a "<q>more open and faster development model</q>".
    Originally the project's governance, spelled out in an earlier version of its
    `[CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea/blob/release/v1.8/CONTRIBUTING.md)`
    file, specified the project would have three "owners" responsible for keeping
    development "<q>healthy</q>". The actual responsibilities and rights of the owners
    were vague, but they were to be elected yearly by Gitea's maintainers "<q>who
    decide with a simple voting model which contributions get accepted and who will
    play the owner role</q>".

- en: That community of maintainers did not get a vote when Gitea's domain and trademarks
    were quietly transferred by two of Gitea's "owners" (Lunny Xiao and Matti Ranta)
    to a for-profit business called Gitea Ltd. The [announcement](https://blog.gitea.com/open-source-sustainment/)
    said this was to meet the goal of "<q>ensuring the long term success of the project</q>"
    by allowing companies "<q>unable to contribute back to open source via sponsorship
    or code contribution</q>" to support Gitea in the form of paying Gitea Ltd directly.
    In addition, the company would "<q>act as a steward</q>" of the project, which
    would "<q>of course remain open source, and a community project</q>". To date,
    the company seems to have remained good to its word about Gitea itself remaining
    open source. It has launched a hosted cloud offering with features not available
    in the self-hosted version, but the self-hosted version of Gitea otherwise remains
    open-source. The "<q>enhanced</q>" enterprise version hinted at in the announcement,
    which one would expect to be open-core, has yet to appear.

    open letter](https://gitea-open-letter.coding.social/) on October 25, 2022 (with
    running updates afterward above the letter) and asked Gitea owners to, instead,
    form a non-profit that would hold the domain and trademarks. Once it was [made
    clear](https://blog.gitea.com/a-message-from-lunny-on-gitea-ltd.-and-the-gitea-project/)
    that would not happen, the community announced it would create a [soft fork](https://gitea-open-letter.coding.social/updates/october-31th/)
    of Gitea to "<q>keep the Gitea community united</q>". The Forgejo project was
    [announced](https://blog.codeberg.org/codeberg-launches-forgejo.html) on December
    15, 2022 under the auspices of Codeberg e.V., a non-profit based in Berlin, Germany
    that provides the [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/) collaboration platform.

    forge, forĝejo. Having learned from earlier mistakes, the community arranged for
    the Forgejo domains to be held by Codeberg e.V., and the project has a detailed
    [set of documents](https://codeberg.org/forgejo/governance/src/branch/main/README.md)
    about various aspects of project governance, such as decision-making, branding,
    merging pull requests, its mission, teams, and how money is handled. While Gitea
    [still uses GitHub](https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea/issues/1029) for development,
    Forgejo has been developed on the Codeberg platform and is now the underlying
    software for Codeberg.

- en: Since its launch in December 2022, Forgejo has followed Gitea development as
    a [set of commits](https://codeberg.org/forgejo/forgejo/milestones?state=closed&q=cleanup)
    on top of the Gitea development branch—doing work in feature branches and rebasing
    on top of Gitea periodically. In early January, Forgejo contributor Earl Warren
    [started a discussion](https://codeberg.org/forgejo/discussions/issues/96) to
    change Forgejo's development workflow and "<q>become independent and cherry-pick
    from the Gitea codebase until the divergences are too great and that becomes impossible</q>".
    Warren argued that the existing workflow no longer made sense because Gitea "<q>merges
    very large untested code (feature or refactor) that have been the cause of major
    regressions with high impact on users</q>". He also argued that a simpler workflow
    would improve stability and make it easier for contributors with a single development
    branch versus multiple feature branches. Warren also claimed that Gitea had "<q>turned
    Open Core</q>" and took issue with its "<q>security behavior</q>" without elaborating.

- en: Following the discussion, Warren put forward a [proposal](https://codeberg.org/forgejo/governance/issues/58)
    on January 14 to change Forgejo's workflow after its next major release or March 1,
    "<q>whichever comes first</q>". In that proposal he also argued that Forgejo has
    the funding, resources, and governance to operate independently, and that the
    change "<q>would not hinder a cooperation that does not exist</q>". While Forgejo
    had consumed Gitea's work, Warren wrote that Gitea contributors "<q>never cherry-picked
    a commit from Forgejo</q>". Warren, at least, [has submitted](https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea/issues?q=earl-warren)
    a number of contributions to Gitea based on work from Forgejo.

    February 16 announcement, the Forgejo project explained that being a soft fork
    meant Forgejo contains "<q>all of Gitea, both good and bad</q>", so users could
    move from Gitea to Forgejo as a drop-in replacement. Those days are not over,
    yet, but the end is in sight. Users planning to move from Gitea to Forgejo should
    do so "<q>sooner rather than later</q>" because "<q>eventually, Forgejo will stop
    being a drop-in replacement</q>". Forgejo does intend to remain compatible with
    the Gitea API, at least as it exists today. The announcement says that any changes
    to the API will be evaluated carefully, and that Forgejo will try to remain compatible
    with Gitea—though contributors may use their own judgment whether or not to implement
    new APIs. The announcement noted that parts of Forgejo have already diverged,
    such as documentation, localization, and the [Forgejo Actions](https://forgejo.org/docs/v1.21/user/actions/)
    continuous-integration system.

    put out a [blog post](https://blog.gitea.com/i-love-fs-day/) (just ahead of the
    Forgejo "hard fork" announcement that was planned in the open) on February 14
    for the Free Software Foundation Europe (FSFE)'s "[I Love Free Software Day](https://fsfe.org/activities/ilovefs/)".

    to speculate whether there's enough interest by users, contributors, and customers
    to sustain both indefinitely. Gogs, for example, doesn't appear to have thrived
    since the Gitea fork. The Gogs repository on GitHub shows recent activity, but
    Gogs's [last release](https://github.com/gogs/gogs/releases/tag/v0.13.0) was on
    February 25, 2023—almost a year ago as of this writing. The demo linked from its
    homepage errors out, and the newsletter link on the homepage leads to a 404 instead
    of current news about the project.

    viable over the long haul. Codeberg, as a platform, has attracted a respectable
    following with more than 117,000 projects and 95,000 users. Respectable, but a
    tiny sample compared to GitHub's millions of projects and users. Unless there's
    a mass exodus from Gitea to Forgejo, it also seems that Gitea will continue at
    about the same pace. Gitea [boasted](https://blog.gitea.com/gitea-hits-40k-stars-on-github-celebrating-open-source-devops-excellence/)
    that it had hit 40,000 stars on GitHub in January of this year, a metric that
    it claimed is demonstrative of Gitea's "<q>significance in empowering developers
    worldwide</q>" as well as "<q>the trust and confidence the global developer community
    places in Gitea</q>". There's more than a touch of irony in citing success on
    a platform you ostensibly seek to replace.

    The post suggested that federation was likely to be included in the 1.19 release,
    and claimed that Forgejo intended to contribute federation upstream to Gitea.
    However, federation did not appear in 1.19 and the [issue tracking federation
    implementation](https://codeberg.org/forgejo/forgejo/issues/59) in Forgejo indicates
    much left to be done. The ForgeFed site lists only one project, called [Vervis](https://vervis.peers.community/browse),
    with a working implementation, but that project does not seem ready for real-world
    usage just yet.

    open-source software development platform that can provide all the features developers
    need and want. Gitea has opted to abandon real community governance to try to
    sustain development by offering commercial support, with a willingness to work
    on top of proprietary platforms and entertain non-open offerings. Forgejo has
    opted for the other road, rejecting proprietary tools and trying to establish
    a community-led, non-profit approach to sustaining itself.
  prefs: []

    to be competing for the same users, contributors, and mind share. It will be interesting
    to look back in a year or three and see how successful they've been, and how much
    impact they've had in moving open-source developers away from proprietary platforms.
