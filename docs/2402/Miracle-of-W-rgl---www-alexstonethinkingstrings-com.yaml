    way? Who gets to give you money, when you’re sitting in lockdown? Are the rules
    of capitalism set in stone? What if money had a use-by date? What if keeping money
    had no advantages?

- en: Wörgl (groovy name) was a wee town in Austria that tackled the Great Depression
    in a novel way. It broke all the rules of standard capitalist economic theory.
    Wörgl printed money. They gave it to the townsfolk, for free.

    Wörgl had people sitting around, out of work. And shops with no customers. The

- en: Wörgl had a population of 4,216\. Being a railway junction, the railway employed
    310 people in 1930, but by 1933 the number had plummeted to 190, following the
    transition to electric loco’s. The cement plant in nearby Kitzbühel employed 50
    workers in 1930, but by 1933 only 2\. The Zipf brewery sacked between 10–14 workers
    from the previous 33–37\. A cellulose factory had once employed 400 workers. In
    1933, just four men were there, idly guarding idle machines. Farmers, a third
    of the work force, could hardly sell their products at depressed prices.

    if you will.

    to do building, on food and furniture and stuff in the local shops, to pay farm
    workers to plough the land and bring in the crops. People paid their taxes.

- en: Wörgl money worked differently. It had a use-by date. So it didn’t pay to accumulate
    it. You had to spend your allocation by the end of the year – or it would decline
    in value by 10 per cent. In dry economic terminology, this is called currency
    demurrage.

    a religious bent, that is reflected in usury – the practice of lending money at
    unreasonably high rates of interest, so the money you give out comes back as more.
    That’s what caused Jesus to lose his cool at the Temple on the Mount. And in the
    next Abrahamic religion that came along, Islam, the charging of interest came
    to be seen as sinful.

    luminaries as French Premier Edouard Daladier and the economist Irving Fisher.
    The “miracle” gained notoriety, and other towns wanted to copy the experiment
    hoping for similar success. Nearby villages even arranged to accept each other’s
    scrip.

    for 170 Mayors—they were intrigued on hearing reports from Wörgl. Among the attendees,
    some opined that it would be a go to introduce "magic money" in their communities
    too.

    was supposed to be *their* schtick to hold great sums of money (and therefore
    power), and for this money to *accumulate*. The poor folk, like those in Wörgl,
    were supposed to *borrow* money at the rich folks at exorbitant interest rates.

    couldn’t last. They use dry and dreary and self-serving arguments like, “any threat
    to centralized control is a threat to the money power”(Yeha! Right on!); or “Wörgl
    could not legislate or enforce monopoly legal tender, so the demand for the scrip
    is partially attributable to the need to pay taxes” (so what?); or “In a matter
    of days the national scrip held as backing in the bank would have been exhausted”
    (but who needs banks anyway, when you get free money?) or “Wörgl was not a miracle,
    but an example of Keynesian spending given incentive by Gresham’s Law” (blah,
    blah…).
