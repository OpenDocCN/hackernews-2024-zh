    in elite athletes compared with healthy nonathletes.^(104 ) When blood samples
    obtained from 413 female and 739 male elite athletes from 12 countries were screened
    for hematologic abnormalities, 1% of the females and 1.4% of the males had hemoglobinopathies.^(105 )
    Furthermore, 2.4% of the females and 0.7% of the males were iron-deficient with
    or without anemia.^(105 ) Accelerated erythropoiesis resulting from the use of
    rhEpo may lead to the production of iron-deficient reticulocytes (reduced MCHr),
    even when iron stores are normal.^(106 ) An increase in hypochromic red cells
    has been seen on rhEpo therapy despite the use of parenteral or oral iron.^(107 )
    Reticulocyte number was not affected by intravenous iron administration in healthy
    humans subjected to a bolus injection of rhEpo (300 U/kg intravenously).^(19 )
    However, MCHr and Ret [Hb] were increased in the intravenous iron/rhEpo group
    compared with the group receiving rhEpo alone. Thus, intravenous iron increases
    the hemopoietic response to rhEpo in normal subjects, and this therapy is probably
    practiced by cheating athletes. Note that parenteral iron alone did not produce
    a change in Hb[mass], [Hb], or specific RBC parameters in young female athletes,
    despite their low baseline [Hb] (128 g/L) and serum ferritin (35 μg/L) levels.^(108 )

    subcutaneous injections of rhEpo (50 U/kg body weight every day) in athletes.
    Reticulocyte numbers were increased from day 10 to 24 and remained elevated for
    7 days after cessation of rhEpo therapy. Reticulocyte numbers were significantly
    lower than the baseline values 14 and 25 days after the last rhEpo injection.
    During treatment up to 14 days after the last rhEpo injection, sTfR and the sTfR/serum
    protein ratio were elevated above baseline.^(12 ) Russell et al^(113 ) administered
    first high (50 U/kg body weight 3 times a week for 3 weeks) and then low doses
    of rhEpo (20 U/kg 3 times a week for 5 weeks), with oral or parenteral iron supplementation.
    Reticulocyte percentage approximately doubled by day 8 of the high-dose rhEpo
    treatment, but during the low-dose phase was not different from baseline values
    or from those of the placebo group, irrespective of the route of iron administration.
    During the washout phase, reticulocyte percentage fell to about half of the baseline
    values in the rhEpo-treated subjects. In a similar study, after frequent weekly
    injections for 14 days and a concomitant doubling in reticulocyte percentage,
    reticulocyte percentage returned to basal levels despite weekly rhEpo injections
    and continuously high [Hb], suggesting a decreased sensitivity to prolonged rhEpo
    treatment.^(39 ) In accordance, low-dose treatment with rhEpo (∼ 15 U/kg 3 times
    a week) did not increase reticulocyte percentage above normal in subjects with
    elevated [Hb] because of previous high doses of rhEpo.^(40 ) However, there are
    no published data to exclude the possibility that low-dose rhEpo may stimulate
    erythropoiesis sufficiently to mask the decrease in reticulocyte percentage after
    RBC transfusion. Parisotto et al^(90 ) subjected recreational athletes to rhEpo
    treatment (50 U/kg 3 times a week for 4 weeks), either supplemented with oral
    or intramuscular iron. The authors analyzed combinations of Hct, Ret-Hct, serum
    Epo, sTfR, and percentage macrocytes by logistic regression. The ON-model identified
    94%-100% of rhEpo group members during the final 2 weeks of the treatment phase.
    One false positive was recorded from a possible 189\. The OFF-model, incorporating
    Ret-Hct, Epo, and Hct, identified 67%-72% of recent uses with no false positive,
    when applied during the washout phase and the period of 12-21 days after the last
    rhEpo injection.^(90 )

  zh: Audran等人^(12 )研究了运动员在重复皮下注射rhEpo（每天50 U/kg体重）后网织红细胞数量的时间过程。从第10天到第24天，网织红细胞数量增加，并在停止rhEpo治疗后保持升高7天。最后一次rhEpo注射后的第14天和第25天，网织红细胞数量显著低于基线值。在最后一次rhEpo注射后的14天内进行治疗期间，sTfR和sTfR/血清蛋白比值均高于基线。^(12 )
    Russell等人^(113 )首先用高剂量（每周3次，每次50 U/kg体重，持续3周）然后用低剂量的rhEpo（每周3次，每次20 U/kg，持续5周），同时口服或注射铁补充。在高剂量rhEpo治疗的第8天，网织红细胞百分比约翻了一倍，但在低剂量阶段，无论铁剂的给药途径如何，与基线值或安慰剂组相比，网织红细胞百分比都与之相同。在冲洗阶段，rhEpo治疗者的网织红细胞百分比下降到基线值的约一半。在类似的研究中，经常每周注射14天后，网织红细胞百分比加倍，但尽管每周注射rhEpo并且持续高[Hb]，网织红细胞百分比仍返回到基线水平，这表明对长期rhEpo治疗的敏感性降低。^(39 )因此，用低剂量rhEpo（∼
    15 U/kg，每周3次）治疗由于先前大剂量rhEpo而导致[Hb]升高的受试者，网织红细胞百分比未增加至正常水平。^(40 )然而，并没有公开数据来排除低剂量rhEpo可能在红细胞输血后刺激造血的可能性。Parisotto等人^(90 )对业余运动员进行了rhEpo治疗（每周3次，每次50
    U/kg，持续4周），并口服或肌肉注射铁补充。作者通过逻辑回归分析了Hct、Ret-Hct、血清Epo、sTfR和大红细胞百分比的组合。ON模型在治疗期的最后2周识别了94%-100%的rhEpo组成员。在冲洗阶段和最后一次rhEpo注射后的12-21天期间应用时，OFF模型，包括Ret-Hct、Epo和Hct，识别了67%-72%的最近使用者，并且没有误识别。^(90 )

    an increase in Hct from 42.7 to 50.8, as well as in sTfR (from 3.1- 6.3 mg/L)

- en: However, apart from blood transfusion or ESA administration, other (legal) stimuli
    can affect some of the parameters included in the blood passport. One such example
    is altitude exposure. Residence at altitude may be associated with an Epo-induced
    increase in [Hb], and it is important to discriminate between the effects of hypoxia
    and rhEpo misuse. Parisotto et al^(89 ) have reported that reticulocyte number,
    Ret Hb mass (Ret-Hb), and the ratio between RBC Hb mass (RBC-Hb) and Ret-Hb in
    nonathletic subjects treated with rhEpo (1200 U/kg body weight over a 9- to 10-day
    period) are more significantly increased than the ones in elite cyclists training
    at altitude (1780 and 2690 m). Ashenden et al^(117 ) retrospectively evaluated
    hematologic data from 19 elite cyclists who lived and trained 2690 m above sea
    level for approximately 1 month, from 6 elite canyon runners who lived 2100 m
    above sea level but descended to compete at sea level and from 39 well-trained
    subjects who resided at sea level but slept at a simulated altitude of 2650 to
    3000 m for 20 to 23 days of either consecutive or intermitted nightly exposure.
    On ascend to a terrestrial altitude, ON- and OFF-model scores increased immediately,
    mainly because of an increase in [Hb]. Scores had not returned fully to baseline
    3 weeks after return to sea level because of the persistence of the raised [Hb]
    for the ON- and OFF-scores and the fall in reticulocyte percentage for OFF-scores.^(117 )
    Abellan et al^(118 ) have reported that short-term hypoxia exposure (simulated
    altitude of 4000-5500 m in a hypobaric chamber) for 3 hours/day, 5 days a week,
    for 5 weeks does not cause an increase in reticulocyte percentage, [Hb], and sTfR.
    Interestingly, the hypoxia exposure was associated with a shift of urinary Epo
    isoforms toward the basic area on IEF. However, these shifts could not be confused
    with the pattern on rhEpo misuse.^(118 ) It should be kept in mind, however, that
    none of the aforementioned altitude studies was able to show increases in Hb[mass]
    or performance and that they did not comply with the minimum recommendations of
    at least 400 hours of altitude/hypoxia exposure needed to increase performance.
    Hence, if the passport approach was to be tested in combination with an altitude
    setting actually leading to performance gains, it seems very likely that also
    many of the parameters included in the blood passport will change substantially,
    which needs to be accounted for during the evaluation process.

  zh: 除了输血或ESA（红细胞生成素）的使用外，其他（合法的）刺激因素可能会影响血液护照中包含的某些参数。其中一个例子是高海拔暴露。居住在高海拔可能与EPO（促红细胞生成素）诱导的[Hb]增加有关，重要的是要区分缺氧和重组人促红细胞生成素滥用的影响。巴里索托等人^(89 )报告称，接受rhEPO治疗（按体重1200
    U/kg，持续9至10天）的非运动员受试者的网织红细胞数量、网织红细胞质量（Ret-Hb）以及红细胞总质量（RBC-Hb）和网织红细胞质量（Ret-Hb）之比明显增加，而这些参数在训练于高海拔的精英自行车手（1780和2690米）中增加的幅度较小。阿什顿登等人^(117 )回顾性地评估了19名生活和训练海拔2690米的精英自行车手的血液学数据，以及6名生活海拔2100米但下降到海平面参加比赛的精英峡谷跑者和39名在海平面居住但每晚在模拟海拔2650至3000米的地方睡眠的训练有素的受试者的数据。在升至陆地高度时，ON-和OFF模型评分立即增加，主要是由于[Hb]的增加。3周后，由于ON-和OFF评分的[Hb]仍然升高和OFF评分的网织红细胞百分比的下降，评分尚未完全恢复到基线水平。阿贝兰等人^(118 )报告称，短期低氧暴露（在低压舱中模拟的海拔4000-5500米）每天3小时，每周5天，连续5周，并不会导致网织红细胞百分比、[Hb]和sTfR（可溶性转铁蛋白受体）的增加。有趣的是，低氧暴露与IEF（等电点聚焦）上的尿EPO同质体向碱性区域的转变相关。然而，这些转变不能与rhEPO滥用的模式混淆。^(118 )然而，应该记住，上述任何高度研究都无法显示Hb[mass]或性能的增加，并且它们不符合至少需要400小时高度/低氧暴露的最低建议，以提高性能。因此，如果护照方法与实际导致性能提高的海拔设置结合测试，那么血液护照中包含的许多参数也很可能发生相当大的变化，这在评估过程中需要考虑到。
