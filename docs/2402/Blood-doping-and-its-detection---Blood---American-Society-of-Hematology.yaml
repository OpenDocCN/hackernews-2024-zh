    in elite athletes compared with healthy nonathletes.^(104 ) When blood samples
    obtained from 413 female and 739 male elite athletes from 12 countries were screened
    for hematologic abnormalities, 1% of the females and 1.4% of the males had hemoglobinopathies.^(105 )
    Furthermore, 2.4% of the females and 0.7% of the males were iron-deficient with
    or without anemia.^(105 ) Accelerated erythropoiesis resulting from the use of
    rhEpo may lead to the production of iron-deficient reticulocytes (reduced MCHr),
    even when iron stores are normal.^(106 ) An increase in hypochromic red cells
    has been seen on rhEpo therapy despite the use of parenteral or oral iron.^(107 )
    Reticulocyte number was not affected by intravenous iron administration in healthy
    humans subjected to a bolus injection of rhEpo (300 U/kg intravenously).^(19 )
    However, MCHr and Ret [Hb] were increased in the intravenous iron/rhEpo group
    compared with the group receiving rhEpo alone. Thus, intravenous iron increases
    the hemopoietic response to rhEpo in normal subjects, and this therapy is probably
    practiced by cheating athletes. Note that parenteral iron alone did not produce
    a change in Hb[mass], [Hb], or specific RBC parameters in young female athletes,
    despite their low baseline [Hb] (128 g/L) and serum ferritin (35 μg/L) levels.^(108 )

    although decreases were observed in some athletes during competition periods.^(110 )
    High and middle fluorescence (immature) Ret with a high RNA content (IRF) are
    relatively frequent in athletes because of continuous bone marrow stimulation
    linked to hemolysis, which is typical of sports activities.^(110 ) Bolus rhEpo
    injections (150 U or 300 U/kg body weight) further increase the IRF.^(111 ) The
    increase in immature Ret starts 36 hours after a single dose of rhEpo, reaching
    a peak after 3-4 days and normalizing within 7 days.^(111 ) A pharmacodynamic
    model calculation has revealed that rhEpo transiently increases the life span
    of circulating Ret from the baseline value of 1.7 days to 3.4 days.^(112 ) Thus,
    the treatment with rhEpo appears to increase Ret values 2-fold: by increased Ret
    release from the bone marrow and by prolonged maturation time of circulating Ret.'

- en: Audran et al^(12 ) studied the time course of reticulocyte number after repeated
    subcutaneous injections of rhEpo (50 U/kg body weight every day) in athletes.
    Reticulocyte numbers were increased from day 10 to 24 and remained elevated for
    7 days after cessation of rhEpo therapy. Reticulocyte numbers were significantly
    lower than the baseline values 14 and 25 days after the last rhEpo injection.
    During treatment up to 14 days after the last rhEpo injection, sTfR and the sTfR/serum
    protein ratio were elevated above baseline.^(12 ) Russell et al^(113 ) administered
    first high (50 U/kg body weight 3 times a week for 3 weeks) and then low doses
    of rhEpo (20 U/kg 3 times a week for 5 weeks), with oral or parenteral iron supplementation.
    Reticulocyte percentage approximately doubled by day 8 of the high-dose rhEpo
    treatment, but during the low-dose phase was not different from baseline values
    or from those of the placebo group, irrespective of the route of iron administration.
    During the washout phase, reticulocyte percentage fell to about half of the baseline
    values in the rhEpo-treated subjects. In a similar study, after frequent weekly
    injections for 14 days and a concomitant doubling in reticulocyte percentage,
    reticulocyte percentage returned to basal levels despite weekly rhEpo injections
    and continuously high [Hb], suggesting a decreased sensitivity to prolonged rhEpo
    treatment.^(39 ) In accordance, low-dose treatment with rhEpo (∼ 15 U/kg 3 times
    a week) did not increase reticulocyte percentage above normal in subjects with
    elevated [Hb] because of previous high doses of rhEpo.^(40 ) However, there are
    no published data to exclude the possibility that low-dose rhEpo may stimulate
    erythropoiesis sufficiently to mask the decrease in reticulocyte percentage after
    RBC transfusion. Parisotto et al^(90 ) subjected recreational athletes to rhEpo
    treatment (50 U/kg 3 times a week for 4 weeks), either supplemented with oral
    or intramuscular iron. The authors analyzed combinations of Hct, Ret-Hct, serum
    Epo, sTfR, and percentage macrocytes by logistic regression. The ON-model identified
    94%-100% of rhEpo group members during the final 2 weeks of the treatment phase.
    One false positive was recorded from a possible 189\. The OFF-model, incorporating
    Ret-Hct, Epo, and Hct, identified 67%-72% of recent uses with no false positive,
    when applied during the washout phase and the period of 12-21 days after the last
    rhEpo injection.^(90 )

- en: After a single administration of high-dose Epo (200 U/kg) Hb and Hct did not
    increase despite an increase in reticulocyte number.^(114 ) The subcutaneous administration
    of rhEpo (∼ 200 U/kg per week) and oral iron (270 mg/day) for 30 days produced
    an increase in Hct from 42.7 to 50.8, as well as in sTfR (from 3.1- 6.3 mg/L)
    and the ratio between sTfR and ferritin (from 3.2- 11.8).^(13 ) Casoni et al^(115 )
    administered rhEpo subcutaneously at doses of 30 U/kg body weight every other
    day for 30-45 days to 20 subjects practicing sports at an amateur level. rhEpo
    treatment was accompanied by twice weekly administration of parenteral iron (62
    mg intravenously) and oral vitamins. The rhEpo-treated subjects had higher values
    for RBC concentrations, [Hb], Hct, MCV, reticulocyte percentage, macrocyte (volume
    > 120 fL), and hypochromic macrocyte counts (MCH < 28 pg) compared with a control
    population of 240 elite athletes from various sport disciplines. Breymann et al^(116 )
    studied the effect of rhEpo in healthy adults when given at different time intervals.
    Fifteen volunteers were randomly selected to receive twice rhEpo (300 U/kg) and
    parenteral iron (200 mg), either within a 24- or 72-hour interval. Controls received
    parenteral iron only. When second rhEpo administration was after 72 hours, volunteers
    showed significantly higher reticulocyte number in the high percentage of young
    RNA-rich Ret (HFR ratio) over several days compared with those who received rhEpo
    within a 24-hour interval. Both rhEpo-treated groups showed an increase in MCVr.
    MCHCr was inversely correlated with the increasing cell size with a nadir on day
    8.^(116 )

- en: However, apart from blood transfusion or ESA administration, other (legal) stimuli
    can affect some of the parameters included in the blood passport. One such example
    is altitude exposure. Residence at altitude may be associated with an Epo-induced
    increase in [Hb], and it is important to discriminate between the effects of hypoxia
    and rhEpo misuse. Parisotto et al^(89 ) have reported that reticulocyte number,
    Ret Hb mass (Ret-Hb), and the ratio between RBC Hb mass (RBC-Hb) and Ret-Hb in
    nonathletic subjects treated with rhEpo (1200 U/kg body weight over a 9- to 10-day
    period) are more significantly increased than the ones in elite cyclists training
    at altitude (1780 and 2690 m). Ashenden et al^(117 ) retrospectively evaluated
    hematologic data from 19 elite cyclists who lived and trained 2690 m above sea
    level for approximately 1 month, from 6 elite canyon runners who lived 2100 m
    above sea level but descended to compete at sea level and from 39 well-trained
    subjects who resided at sea level but slept at a simulated altitude of 2650 to
    3000 m for 20 to 23 days of either consecutive or intermitted nightly exposure.
    On ascend to a terrestrial altitude, ON- and OFF-model scores increased immediately,
    mainly because of an increase in [Hb]. Scores had not returned fully to baseline
    3 weeks after return to sea level because of the persistence of the raised [Hb]
    for the ON- and OFF-scores and the fall in reticulocyte percentage for OFF-scores.^(117 )
    Abellan et al^(118 ) have reported that short-term hypoxia exposure (simulated
    altitude of 4000-5500 m in a hypobaric chamber) for 3 hours/day, 5 days a week,
    for 5 weeks does not cause an increase in reticulocyte percentage, [Hb], and sTfR.
    Interestingly, the hypoxia exposure was associated with a shift of urinary Epo
    isoforms toward the basic area on IEF. However, these shifts could not be confused
    with the pattern on rhEpo misuse.^(118 ) It should be kept in mind, however, that
    none of the aforementioned altitude studies was able to show increases in Hb[mass]
    or performance and that they did not comply with the minimum recommendations of
    at least 400 hours of altitude/hypoxia exposure needed to increase performance.
    Hence, if the passport approach was to be tested in combination with an altitude
    setting actually leading to performance gains, it seems very likely that also
    many of the parameters included in the blood passport will change substantially,
    which needs to be accounted for during the evaluation process.
