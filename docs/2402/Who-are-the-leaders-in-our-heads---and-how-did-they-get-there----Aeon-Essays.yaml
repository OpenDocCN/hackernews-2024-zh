    and bloody story in the Hebrew scriptures. It begins with King David, sitting
    in his palace in Jerusalem, lazily gazing at a woman bathing in a nearby house.
    David has his servants bring her to him. The woman, Bathsheba, is married to a
    Hittite named Uriah, a soldier in the Israelite army, who is off fighting the
    Ammonites in one of the wars that had helped establish David as a powerful and
    wealthy king. From her tryst with David, Bathsheba conceives. Eager to hide his
    deed, David summons Uriah from the battlefield. After feting him in his palace,
    David sends Uriah to have a conjugal visit with his wife so that he will be assumed
    to be the father of David’s child. But Uriah ruins David’s plan when he refuses
    to go to his house, and instead sleeps outside the king’s door. He explains to
    David that he could not possibly sleep with his wife and feel the pleasures of
    home while his fellow soldiers are mired in battle. Uriah’s honour and integrity
    push King David to greater duplicity: he sends Uriah back to the battlefield with
    a private message to David’s general, Joab, instructing the general to place Uriah
    in the battle frontline, where he is likely to be killed. And so it happens: Uriah
    dies – because of a note that he was ordered to take to his commander without
    knowing its contents. Back in Jerusalem, Bathsheba grieves for her husband, and
    David soon makes her the newest of his many wives.'

    a personal example of modesty and courage, as he once did, but sits in a luxurious
    palace, a fat cat, a Peeping Tom, while others fight and die on his behalf. So

    soldiers, their daughters to be his cooks and perfumers, take over their lands,
    and enslave the people, and no one will have the right or the ability to stand

    came true), choose to have a king rule over them. And once they do, as Samuel
    warned them, that power is not meant to be challenged by other men – because the
    king is God’s choice and rules in his name. That was why regicide (the murder
    of a king) was considered, well into the early modern era, the worst crime one
    could possibly commit – it was against the ruler *and* against God. At the same
    time, the emergence of a king with earthly power but still *under* God is a conception
    of leadership that is constrained by a sort of morality, even if that term did
    not exist then. David abuses his power, and the biblical author implies that the

    people to be leaders, attributing to them virtue and handing to them authority
    – but also, at the same time, to limit the power of those rulers. On the one hand,
    the conception of leadership found in this story of King David’s crime and punishment
    gives the leader almost limitless power. On the other hand, it implies that there
    is a threshold that even he cannot pass; David, as the king, remains subservient
    to the higher power of God. And so, even if ordinary people cannot check their
    leaders, God can. And faith in God, worshipping God, doing God’s work, means that
    the people can be sure of God’s protection from a leader who abuses his or her

    part of a world in which the existence of God was as real to nearly everyone in
    Europe (and most other places) as the Sun and the Moon. Machiavelli acknowledged
    that God played some role in human affairs; at various points in *The Prince*,
    he seems to take for granted the idea that rulers rose and fell at least in part
    because of God’s will, and because of ‘fortune’ (which he coupled with ‘God’).
    But he also claimed that men had ‘free will’ and that while ‘fortune is the arbiter
    of one-half of our actions’, ‘she still leaves us to direct the other half, or
    perhaps a little less.’ Elsewhere, Machiavelli recounts several miracles and punishments
    that God was responsible for, and with which he directed what happened in the
    world, but adds that: ‘God is not willing to do everything, and thus take away
    our free will and that share of glory which belongs to us.’'

  zh: 像《圣经》一样，《君主论》是[一部基础性作品](https://aeon.co/essays/the-prince-of-the-people-machiavelli-was-no-machiavellian)；无论是否阅读过它，我们生活在一个它直接或间接帮助塑造的世界中，无论好坏。几乎两千年后，关于大卫、拔示巴和乌利亚的《圣经》故事写成之时，《君主论》仍是一个世界的一部分，其中上帝的存在对欧洲（及大多数其他地方）的几乎每个人来说与太阳和月亮一样真实。马基雅维利承认上帝在人类事务中发挥了某种作用；在《君主论》的各个地方，他似乎理所当然地认为统治者的兴衰至少部分是因为上帝的意愿，以及因为‘命运’（他将其与‘上帝’联系在一起）。但他还声称人类有‘自由意志’，并且虽然‘命运决定了我们行动的一半’，‘她仍然让我们自己控制另一半，或者说可能少一点’。在其他地方，马基雅维利描述了上帝负责的几个奇迹和惩罚，并且通过这些来指导世界上发生的事情，但他补充道：‘上帝并不愿意做所有事情，因此剥夺我们的自由意志和属于我们的光荣份额。’
- en: 'But despite Machiavelli’s grudging acceptance that God still mattered, his
    prince exists in a new mental universe from the one in II Samuel, one in which
    leadership is bound not to the supernatural, or to morality, but to objectives.
    The Prophet Nathan’s parable about the rich man and the poor man and their sheep
    would be changed under Machiavelli: the prince shouldn’t avoid taking the poor
    man’s sole sheep because it is an immoral act that would anger God; he should
    avoid it because such a mean act would make him hated and the people’s hatred
    would thwart his ambitions. On the other hand, because it is ‘better to be feared
    than loved’, it is fine, and even desirable, that those under the prince know
    that he is perfectly capable of taking their sheep (as it were) if they do not
    do as he tells them – and that he goes through with this punishment when it is
    necessary. This is a wholly new way of thinking of leadership because it provides
    a guide for the aspiring leader based not on what is morally right but on how
    politics works in the real world. Machiavelli, in that sense, helps usher us from
    the old world to the new, where anything seems possible, and in which the leader
    makes not only her own destiny, but also history.'

  zh: 尽管马基雅维利勉强接受上帝仍然重要的事实，但他的君主存在于一个新的心理宇宙中，不同于撒母耳记下的世界，那是一个领导力不再被超自然或道德约束，而是被目标约束的世界。先知拿单关于富人和穷人及其羊的寓言在马基雅维利手中将会有所变化：君主不应该因为夺取穷人唯一的羊而避免，因为这是一种不道德的行为会激怒上帝；他应该避免这样做，因为这种卑鄙的行为会让他受人憎恨，人们的憎恨会挫败他的野心。另一方面，因为‘宁可被人畏惧，不可被人爱’，如果那些在君主统治下的人知道他完全有能力夺取他们的羊（可以这么说），如果他们不按他的指示行事，他行使这种惩罚是可以的，甚至是可取的。这是一种全新的领导力思维方式，因为它为渴望成为领导者的人提供了一个指南，不是基于道德上的对错，而是基于政治在现实世界中的运作方式。在这个意义上，马基雅维利帮助我们从旧世界迈向新世界，那里任何事情似乎都有可能发生，领导者不仅塑造自己的命运，也塑造历史。
- en: 'Yet even in Machiavelli’s brave new world, in which leaders can supposedly
    shape their own destinies, not all is possible. Leaders still must deal with quite
    powerful and resistant things: structures. Systems. Institutions. Other leaders.
    Adversaries. Enemies. In a Machiavellian world, perhaps the most daunting challenge
    facing rulers is other people realising that the ruler’s power is not guaranteed
    and protected by divine authority, so the ruler can be displaced – without incurring
    God’s wrath. And so, reading about Machiavelli’s prince after reading about King
    David in the Bible brings us to the big question at the heart of the issue of
    leadership: does the leader make history or does history make the leader? If we
    want to understand leadership, and how it works in the world, should we be looking
    primarily at the ways the leader changed the world? Or should we focus on the
    ways in which the world produced, and then constrained, the leader?'

  zh: 然而，即使在马基雅维利的勇敢新世界中，领导者据说可以塑造自己的命运，也并非一切皆有可能。领导者仍然必须面对非常强大和抵抗的事物：结构、系统、机构、其他领导者、对手、敌人。在马基雅维利的世界中，或许统治者面临的最大挑战是其他人意识到统治者的权力并非由神圣权威保证和保护，因此统治者可能会被取代
    — 而不会招致上帝的愤怒。因此，在读完《圣经》中大卫王的故事后再读马基雅维利的王子，我们来到了领导问题核心的大问题：领导者是创造历史，还是历史塑造领导者？如果我们想要理解领导力以及它在世界中的运作方式，我们应该主要关注领导者如何改变世界？还是应该专注于世界如何产生并限制领导者？

- en: The Machiavellian model probably applies best to leaders who wield superior
    power, or who have a lot of built-in advantages. If, say, you are a political
    leader in a functioning democracy and were elected democratically, you have broad
    legitimacy. If you are a dictator backed by your country’s military and other
    institutions, or you are the CEO of a large corporation in a country with a political
    economy designed to serve the interests of large corporations and their CEOs,
    you will have a lot of choices in how to ‘lead’. This is especially true if, following
    Machiavelli’s advice, you believe you are free from the constraints of morality,
    or God’s scolding oversight.

- en: There is a direct line from Machiavelli to the individualistic conception of
    leadership one sees everywhere today. But how does this view of leaders and their
    ability to shape reality apply to leaders who are in *opposition* to power? Leaders
    are sometimes heads of state or captains of industry, but other times they have
    considerably less power, trying to *constrain* the leaders above them in the hierarchy.
    Perhaps they are whistleblowers exposing corruption or misdeeds inside mighty
    companies or institutions, or members of an underground group fighting to overthrow
    a brutal dictator.

    might not have had formal power or authority. They might not even be famous. They

    the conception of leadership that we find in II Samuel, with its insistence on
    morality as a constraint on even the most powerful rulers, still has purchase
