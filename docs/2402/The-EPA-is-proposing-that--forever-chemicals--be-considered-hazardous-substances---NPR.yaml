- en: The Environmental Protection Agency is proposing that nine PFAS, also known
    as "forever chemicals," be categorized as hazardous to human health.

- en: The EPA signed a proposal Wednesday that would deem the chemicals "hazardous
    constituents" under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act.

- en: For the agency to consider a substance a hazardous constituent, it has to be
    toxic or cause cancer, genetic mutation or the malformations of an embryo. The
    full list of the nine substances can be found [here.](https://www.epa.gov/hw/proposal-list-nine-and-polyfluoroalkyl-compounds-resource-conservation-and-recovery-act)

- en: The agency cited various studies in which forever chemicals were found to cause
    a litany of "toxic effects" in humans and animals, including, but not limited
    to cancer, a decreased response to vaccinations, high cholesterol, decrease in
    fertility in women, preeclampsia, thyroid disorders and asthma, the EPA said.

    chemicals. PFAS are often used for manufacturing purposes, such as in nonstick
    cookware, adhesives, firefighting foam, turf and more.

- en: PFAS have been called "forever chemicals" because they break down very slowly
    and can accumulate in people, animals and the environment. Last summer, [a study
    by the U.S. Geological Survey](https://www.npr.org/2023/07/06/1186230007/drinking-water-forever-chemicals-pfas-study)
    found that the man-made chemicals are present in nearly half the country's tap
    water supply.

    USGS said, and they can pose a health threat even at very small amounts.

    in lawsuit settlements to help detoxify water supplies across the country, after
    plaintiffs claimed the company's firefighting foam and other products were responsible
    for contaminating tap water with PFAS.
