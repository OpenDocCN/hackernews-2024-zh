    constituents" under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act.

    toxic or cause cancer, genetic mutation or the malformations of an embryo. The
    full list of the nine substances can be found [here.](https://www.epa.gov/hw/proposal-list-nine-and-polyfluoroalkyl-compounds-resource-conservation-and-recovery-act)

    a litany of "toxic effects" in humans and animals, including, but not limited
    to cancer, a decreased response to vaccinations, high cholesterol, decrease in
    fertility in women, preeclampsia, thyroid disorders and asthma, the EPA said.

    chemicals. PFAS are often used for manufacturing purposes, such as in nonstick
    cookware, adhesives, firefighting foam, turf and more.

    and can accumulate in people, animals and the environment. Last summer, [a study
    by the U.S. Geological Survey](https://www.npr.org/2023/07/06/1186230007/drinking-water-forever-chemicals-pfas-study)
    found that the man-made chemicals are present in nearly half the country's tap
    water supply.

    plaintiffs claimed the company's firefighting foam and other products were responsible
