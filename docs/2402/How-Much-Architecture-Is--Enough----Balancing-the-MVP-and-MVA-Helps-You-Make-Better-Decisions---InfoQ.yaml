    MVA is the architectural complement to a *Minimum Viable Product* or *MVP*. The
    MVA balances the MVP by making sure that the MVP is technically viable, sustainable,
    and extensible over time; it is what differentiates the MVP from a throw-away
    proof of concept. It is what makes the MVP the seed of a new product.

    to the MVP. In this fashion, both the product and its associated software architecture
    evolve in a series of increments. This co-evolution is depicted in Figure 1.
