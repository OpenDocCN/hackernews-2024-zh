    banning “digital discrimination,” which is when internet service providers (ISPs)
    inequitably deploy high-speed internet connections or disproportionately withhold
    the best deals for their services from racially or socio-economically marginalized
    neighborhoods.

    the types of discrimination the city could investigate to include digital discrimination.
    Members of the public will be able to submit complaints alleging digital discrimination,
    which the city’s Civil, Human Rights and Equity Department will investigate. The
    department will be required to collect demographic information about the people
    making complaints and report on any trends.

    actions to be discriminatory even if the intent behind them wasn’t explicitly
    to treat different groups inequitably. Instead, all that would be necessary is
    showing that a decision made by an ISP caused the groups to be impacted differently.
