    2, and it's easy to believe that it's somebody else trying to manipulate your
    watch, because it's a lot of random screen presses and swipes (which is, of course,
    the main way of interacting with the watch).

    you have on the display. For mine, it kept starting lots of timers, which then
    of course started buzzing and flashing as they went off...

    the random screen taps will quickly result in a keypad asking you to enter your
    PIN, and you'll see what looks like somebody trying lots and lots of attempts
    to hack into your watch...

    pretty wild!

    a fix for this, and by resetting a few times and putting the watch on its charger,
    I managed to get it to recover to the point where I could do the software update.
    So far, it now seems fine. We shall see... :-)
