# More

I strive for a free world and I'm a supporter of the Free Software Foundation.

I want you to feel at home here in this corner of the web, and that you join me in my adventure for more freedom in our day-to-day computing. Join the free world we've built, thanks to GNU, Linux and thousands of other wonderful projects.

I'm always working on computer systems, improving my Emacs workflow and config file, working with functional programming, engineering reliable systems and databases.

You can also find me playing some guitar üé∏, or doing some CrossFit.
