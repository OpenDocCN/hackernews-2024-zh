    back in November 2023 while attending to a call at McLaren Circle in Kissimmee,

    the roof of his car. He then turned and emptied every bullet from his gun, each

    his girlfriend’s car, was in the back of the police cruiser. Officers had searched,
    handcuffed and loaded the accused into the back of the police car and, despite
    being cuffed, it was Jackson that the officer thought was shooting at him.

    then also fired her weapon. In interviews after the incident, Roberts claimed
    she opened fire as she thought “that I was watching him be killed.”

    What’s more, in his body cam footage you can clearly see the acorn fall into frame
    and strike the roof of his car. When asked if this was the sound he heard, Hernandez
    had this to tell investigators:'

- en: After hearing the sound of the acorn, the deputy reported that he also felt
    a “tingliness” all along the side of his body. He then said his “legs just give
    out” and he fell to the ground, assuming that he had been seriously injured by
    something.
