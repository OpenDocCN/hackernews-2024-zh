    back in November 2023 while attending to a call at McLaren Circle in Kissimmee,
    Florida. Hernandez had been [attending a call in the area](https://jalopnik.com/bodycam-shows-florida-cop-driving-off-after-being-stopp-1850533602)
    when an acorn fell from an oak tree and struck the roof of his squad car.

    to the ground and shouted “shots fired” after [the acorn strikes](https://jalopnik.com/ah-nuts-acorn-stashing-squirrels-mess-up-mans-gearbox-1821713668)
    the roof of his car. He then turned and emptied every bullet from his gun, each
    aimed squarely at his squad car.

    his girlfriend’s car, was in the back of the police cruiser. Officers had searched,
    handcuffed and loaded the accused into the back of the police car and, despite
    being cuffed, it was Jackson that the officer thought was shooting at him.

    then also fired her weapon. In interviews after the incident, Roberts claimed
    she opened fire as she thought “that I was watching him be killed.”

    vehicle, he told an investigation that he didn’t remember seeing the flash of
    a gun or [any glass smashing in the car](https://jalopnik.com/these-are-the-weirdest-car-windows-ever-built-1851142188).
    What’s more, in his body cam footage you can clearly see the acorn fall into frame
    and strike the roof of his car. When asked if this was the sound he heard, Hernandez
    had this to tell investigators:'

    speaking] what I heard [3 second pause in speaking] sounded almost like [12 second
    pause in speaking] what I heard sounded what I think would be louder than an acorn
    hitting the roof of the car, but there’s obviously an acorn hitting the roof of
    the car.”

    a “tingliness” all along the side of his body. He then said his “legs just give
    out” and he fell to the ground, assuming that he had been seriously injured by
    something.

    and shouting to his colleague that he’s been hit. It’s all very dramatic.

    warrant Hernandez to open fire on a car. During the course of the investigation
    into the shooting, deputy Herandez resigned from the force.
