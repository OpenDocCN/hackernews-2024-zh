- en: Gemma is designed with our [AI Principles](https://ai.google.dev/responsible?utm_source=agd&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=explore-responsible&utm_content)
    at the forefront. As part of making Gemma pre-trained models safe and reliable,
    we used automated techniques to filter out certain personal information and other
    sensitive data from training sets. Additionally, we used extensive fine-tuning
    and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) to align our instruction-tuned
    models with responsible behaviors. To understand and reduce the risk profile for
    Gemma models, we conducted robust evaluations including manual red-teaming, automated
    adversarial testing, and assessments of model capabilities for dangerous activities.
    These evaluations are outlined in our [Model Card](https://www.kaggle.com/models/google/gemma).
