    Perkins, one of Australia’s most celebrated athletes who won gold medals in the

    11 world records, warned that “someone will die if we allow that sort of environment
    to continue to foster and flourish.” Perkins’ sentiment was echoed by Sport New
    Zealand chief executive Raelene Castle, who likened the Enhanced Games to lethal
    dystopian contests like “Squid Games or Hunger Games,” and follows reports of
    another Australian swimmer [publicly endorsing](https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/feb/09/australian-swimmer-james-magnussen-enhanced-games-drug-taking

    for breaking the 50m freestyle world record. “I’ll juice to the gills and I’ll
    break it in six months,” he said. The Enhanced Games has promised to cut Magnussen
    a check if he breaks the record. The [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/ondcp/briefing-room/2024/03/15/in-a-pre-olympics-effort-to-combat-doping-in-sports-white-house-drug-policy-director-travels-to-switzerland-for-wada-executive-committee-meeting-and-annual-symposium/

    efforts like the Enhanced Games put athletes’ health at risk, undermines the integrity

    In a statement to Forbes, Travis Tygart, CEO of the United States Anti-Doping
    Agency (USADA), described the entire project as a “dangerous clown show that puts
    profit over principle.” Tygart added that “while those behind the Enhanced Games
    might be looking to make a quick buck, that profit would come at the expense of

    the need to build new stadiums and push cities into debt. It will also mean athletes

    the Olympic Games can generate billions in revenue, successful athletes see only
    a [fraction](https://enhanced.org/event-plan/ "https://enhanced.org/event-plan/")

- en: By nature, competitive athletes strive to be the very best at what they do and
    train hard to achieve this. Inevitably, athletes look beyond themselves for ways
    of getting an edge, which can range from an improved diet, training at high altitudes
    and exploiting advances in sports medicine and psychology to high-tech gear like
    bikes, shoes and swimming costumes, blood doping and drugs. A number of these
    methods, notably using drugs, have potentially negative health consequences for
    athletes and are viewed as giving an unfair advantage over other competitors.
    While there is no clear consensus on where the dividing line is between permissible
    and impermissible enhancement—the boundary often changes with new scientific advances
    as well—high level contests frequently test athletes to eliminate the use of performance-enhancing
    drugs. Athletes in many professional leagues can be sanctioned or barred from
    competition for doping, and some fans reject any [records set by athletes](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/05/sports/baseball/aaron-judge-barry-bonds-asterisks-records.html
