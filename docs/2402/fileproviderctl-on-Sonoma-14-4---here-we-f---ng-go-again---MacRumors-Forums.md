They were not deprecated earlier - they are still present in macOS 14.3.

The commands are used to manipulate any software that uses the FileProvider API — well known examples are Google Drive, OneDrive, Dropbox, iCloud Drive, CloudMounter, Strongsync, and many others. The removed commands were useful for troubleshooting and fixing sync issues with these apps, espcially the `evict` and `domain` subcommands.
