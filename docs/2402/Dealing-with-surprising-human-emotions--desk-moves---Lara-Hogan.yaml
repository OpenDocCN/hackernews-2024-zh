- en: Dealing with surprising human emotions is one of the most challenging aspects
    of being a manager. Generally, when someone appears triggered, or angry, or some
    other strong emotion that’s surprising, it’s likely that their [amygdala has been
    hijacked](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amygdala_hijack), which I’ve [written
    about before](http://larahogan.me/blog/the-high-road/). Our amygdalas are in charge
    of our emotional reactions, and they’re critical to our “fight or flight” decisionmaking
    process. When our core needs feel threatened, our amygdala kicks into high gear.

    Similarly, if someone says having choice is important to them, maybe that’s *actually*
