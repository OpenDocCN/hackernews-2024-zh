- en: Dealing with surprising human emotions is one of the most challenging aspects
    of being a manager. Generally, when someone appears triggered, or angry, or some
    other strong emotion that’s surprising, it’s likely that their [amygdala has been
    hijacked](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amygdala_hijack), which I’ve [written
    about before](http://larahogan.me/blog/the-high-road/). Our amygdalas are in charge
    of our emotional reactions, and they’re critical to our “fight or flight” decisionmaking
    process. When our core needs feel threatened, our amygdala kicks into high gear.

    you’re probably confused^([2](#two)). Moving where someone sits every day is just
    logistics, right? You have a group of people in one place, and you need them to
    start sitting somewhere else. Desk moves are my favorite example of **why managers
    should understand the brain science** behind why people react they way they do,
    in otherwise not-that-emotional circumstances.

    for individuals to have full choice and autonomy over aspects of their work life.

    sat in a cool spot in the office, while HR and Finance definitely did not.)

    Showing up and working from the same physical location (same view, same layout,

    Predictability need. When one even small thing in that routine shifts, it can
    be challenging.

    so I often ask “do you prefer public or private recognition?” and use that as
    a baseline. Managers often guess people feel most recognized with money or a title
    change, but in my experience, those things are good band-aids for Status but don’t
    cut to the core of this need.'

    like with the equality/fairness value, don’t deny how someone feels (they’re telling

    example, “Status” is the core need that comes up most for me, personally - so

    needs with them. For example, when someone says they’re looking for status recognition
    with a higher base salary, it’s possible that there’s another need lying below.
    Similarly, if someone says having choice is important to them, maybe that’s *actually*
    because having choice means they have higher status, or things are more fair,
    or something else. Ask coaching questions to explore your reports’ needs so you
    can make sure you’re accurately understanding and addressing them.
