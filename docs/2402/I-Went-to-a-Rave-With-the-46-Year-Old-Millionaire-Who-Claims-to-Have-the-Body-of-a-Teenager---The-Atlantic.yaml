    enthusiast Bryan Johnson are straightforward: “Go to bed on time, eat healthy
    food, and exercise,” he told a crowd in Brooklyn on Saturday morning. “But to
    start, you guys are now going to do a breathing exercise.” He directed the 100-plus
    people gathered around him to put their hands on the shoulders of their neighbors,
    forming a series of concentric circles; he then counted as we inhaled and exhaled
    in unison.'

- en: I had arrived at a bouldering gym for the first in a series of events held that
    day by Johnson, a 46-year-old centimillionaire who made his fortune in Silicon
    Valley but is best known for waging a war on death that he claims to be winning.
    His ambitions are somehow greater, and more science-fictional, than those of other
    biohackers and life-extension fanatics—a group that includes [Peter Thiel](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2016/08/peter-thiel-wants-to-inject-himself-with-young-peoples-blood),
    [Jeff Bezos](https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/09/04/1034364/altos-labs-silicon-valleys-jeff-bezos-milner-bet-living-forever/),

    Johnson preaches perhaps the most brazen iteration of Silicon Valley’s emerging
    obsession with AI and commitment to [restructuring society](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2024/03/facebook-meta-silicon-valley-politics/677168/)
    around the technology. He believes he has figured out how algorithms, instead
    of ruining civilization, can lead him to the land of immortals. He wants you,
    after you exhale on the count of six, to follow.

    work, found that his soul was crushed as a consequence, and experienced a kind
    of epiphany in response. He had founded an online-payment company called Braintree
    that was eventually acquired by PayPal for $800 million. Meanwhile, Johnson has
    said, he struggled with depression, left the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day
    Saints, and soothed himself with late-night binge eating. A few years ago, he
    grew tired of being miserable in and feeling powerless over his body. So he ceded
    control of it: Just as he imagines that AI will one day run the planet, a much
    simpler algorithm now runs his body.'

    30 medical specialists who monitor and analyze data about his organs. In addition
    to rising around 4:30 a.m. and going to bed at 8:30 p.m., getting plenty of intense
    exercise, and taking dozens of supplements throughout the day, Johnson has gotten
    experimental blood-plasma transfusions from his teenage son, bone-marrow transplants,
    and gene therapy. He claims that this anti-aging protocol, called Blueprint, has
    slowed his overall pace of aging by 31 years, put his cardiovascular capacity
    among the top 1.5 percent of 18-year-olds, and delivered nighttime erections that
    are frequent enough to rival a teenager’s. (He tracks them through a wearable
    device called the Adam Sensor while he sleeps.)

    into a kind of messiah. On social media, he compares [himself](https://twitter.com/bryan_johnson/status/1683973651253841921)
    [favorably](https://twitter.com/bryan_johnson/status/1677348309617500161) to Jesus,
    reasoning that his algorithmically sanctioned, lentil-and-macadamia-nut-heavy
    diet beats refined carbohydrates and wine. The Brooklyn meetups—the gym, a dinner,
    and a rave—gave him ample opportunities to spread his gospel, which he calls the
    “Don’t Die” movement. On Saturday, Johnson recited to me a now-common refrain.
    He wants to prepare as many people as possible for what he thinks will be the
    greatest shock humanity has ever confronted: our impending replacement by superintelligent
    AI. Once that happens, our species’ only remaining purpose will be to not die—and,
    conveniently, he has already optimized and prepackaged the steps for accomplishing
    this mission (he’ll sell you his purportedly life-extending olive oil, for instance,
    for $30 a bottle). Johnson, in other words, is trying to get people on board with
    using one sort of AI to achieve immortality, all in the service of preventing
    another sort of AI, which does not yet exist, from taking over our lives. And
    for some reason, this involves an erection-tracking ring.'

    a twist on the caption: Join, and Don’t Die—Johnson told me he wants to create
    a Don’t Die nation of 20 million people. This may sound unhinged, but people are
    listening. Johnson’s societal ambition echoes that of growing numbers of tech
    executives and venture capitalists trying to build [alternative cities and states](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2024/03/silicon-valley-billionaires-building-cities/677173/).

    whom he calls the “Don’t Die Army.” In addition to the meetups Johnson hosted
    in New York on Saturday, there have been more than 200 Blueprint gatherings in
    75 countries this year. Some 5,000 people recently enrolled in a self-experimentation
    study to see how well the Blueprint protocol works on a broader population. Throughout
    the day, Johnson repeatedly joked that he was starting a cult.'

    crypto investors, and software developers; one man told me that he is on a “longevity
    journey.” I met several individuals who had adopted the Blueprint protocol for
    themselves and had blood work done for Johnson’s study, multiple anti-aging researchers,
    and many people who said that they never want to die.

    brother, a neighbor, a colleague—interested in their health and drawn in by what,
    to them, seemed like an evidence-based approach to physical and mental well-being.
    Johnson presents himself as the ultimate guinea pig. Dadelie Volmar, a woman in
    her 40s, told me that Johnson’s story inspired her to “try to gain back time”
    lost to neglecting her body; Ukachi Asogu, who works in finance, told me that
    adapting Johnson’s method to her own needs helped her lose 80 pounds. College
    and graduate students spoke about wanting to be healthy for their studies; a nurse
    said she found Blueprint after seeing how many conditions in older patients are
    preventable; others I spoke with just wanted more energy. These were people not
    interested in superintelligence or immortality so much as in living healthier,
    perhaps for a bit longer—using the sleep tracker Johnson recommends, testing his
    recipes.

    dozen people in a spacious apartment on Saturday evening to hear more about Johnson’s
    vision. This was billed as a conversation about “the future of being human,” and
    we were served a light dinner of Blueprint-sanctioned foods: cups of a lightly
    sweet, chocolaty goo called “nutty pudding”; hummus and crackers; chocolate-coated
    macadamia-nut bars cut into bite-size squares. After the room settled, Johnson

    evening’s opening speech echoed our interview earlier that day and a conversation
    I had with Johnson last April, sometimes almost verbatim. Within his lifetime,
    Johnson told the room, AI will eliminate the need for humans to generate knowledge
    themselves. We will instead follow the decisions made by all-powerful software.
    Our species will be rendered purposeless, doomed to destroy itself or the planet.
    To prevent this fate, we will need to funnel all of our energy toward the one
    goal that almost everyone can agree on: survival. “On the eve of superintelligence,
    the only thing we can do as an intelligent species is not dying,” Johnson said.'

    In Johnson’s telling, algorithms obsolete humanity while also bestowing immortality
    by allowing us to optimize every health decision. It doesn’t make much sense—the
    Don’t Die creed assumes that superintelligent AI is inevitable and death is not,
    that a lifestyle tailored for one person can save a species. Blueprint cannot
    be called rigorous science, is a source of revenue for Johnson, and has been credibly
    [compared](https://www.vice.com/en/article/z34ay8/bryan-johnson-blueprint-aging-biotech)
    to an eating disorder. Indeed, not everyone at the dinner was sold. One attendee
    commented that the philosophy seemed rooted in fearing death rather than celebrating
    life. Another noted that extending life for its own sake, rather than living for
    some other purpose, seemed silly. And still another suggested that accepting death
    would actually be the best way to embrace the unknown (Johnson told her to try
    it and “report back”).

    terms of the present instead of the unknowable future AI will bring about. He
    takes the arrival of superintelligence as a matter of faith, trusting seemingly
    every company in Silicon Valley working to bring such machines into existence.
    Johnson likened the situation to trying to convince a two-dimensional creature
    that a third dimension exists; to telling someone in the 1870s that microscopic
    germs cause disease, or someone in the 16th-century Catholic Church that the Earth
    revolves around the sun. The analogies reminded me of Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai
    [comparing](https://fortune.com/2023/04/17/sundar-pichai-a-i-more-profound-than-fire-electricity/)
    AI to the invention of fire, or Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella [likening](https://www.wired.com/story/microsofts-satya-nadella-is-betting-everything-on-ai/)
    the technology to the arrival of electricity—mind-bending analogies that don’t
    actually say anything meaningful about this speculative future.

    over to Ghost—a capped-membership gym for [“thought leaders and creatives”](https://www.ghost.xyz/)—to
    participate in a three-hour dance party. We would end precisely at midnight so
    everybody could get some sleep. The bar served three mocktails: Prometheus, Autonomous
    Self, and Vampire (the latter, a fruity red concoction, did not make me feel younger).
    A DJ played EDM from a boxing ring. Around 10 p.m., Johnson pranced onto the dance
    floor wearing the same tee, now cropped just below the segmented snake to reveal
    chiseled abs. For the next two hours, largely uninterrupted, his legs bounced
    in a frenzied dance that was part Irish jig, part Electric Slide, part Happy Feet.'

    “I need to go home, man,” he whispered. It was well past the bedtime prescribed
    by his sacred longevity protocol—“I’m dying a little bit tonight,” he had said
    earlier. As he glanced over at a few stragglers still at the rave, I asked him
    why he’d broken his own rules. Ostensibly, Johnson had sacrificed his sleep to
    grow the movement. But dancing late, in violation of his algorithm and thus to
    the detriment of his life span, also clearly brought him tremendous joy—why? He
    contemplated for several seconds before responding. “I don’t know,” he said. “I
    don’t know.”
