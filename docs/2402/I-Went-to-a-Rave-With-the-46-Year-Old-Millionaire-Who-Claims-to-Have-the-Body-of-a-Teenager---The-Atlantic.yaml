    work, found that his soul was crushed as a consequence, and experienced a kind
    of epiphany in response. He had founded an online-payment company called Braintree
    that was eventually acquired by PayPal for $800 million. Meanwhile, Johnson has
    said, he struggled with depression, left the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day
    Saints, and soothed himself with late-night binge eating. A few years ago, he
    grew tired of being miserable in and feeling powerless over his body. So he ceded
    control of it: Just as he imagines that AI will one day run the planet, a much
    simpler algorithm now runs his body.'

    30 medical specialists who monitor and analyze data about his organs. In addition

    exercise, and taking dozens of supplements throughout the day, Johnson has gotten
    experimental blood-plasma transfusions from his teenage son, bone-marrow transplants,
    and gene therapy. He claims that this anti-aging protocol, called Blueprint, has
    slowed his overall pace of aging by 31 years, put his cardiovascular capacity
    among the top 1.5 percent of 18-year-olds, and delivered nighttime erections that
    are frequent enough to rival a teenager’s. (He tracks them through a wearable

    and a rave—gave him ample opportunities to spread his gospel, which he calls the
    “Don’t Die” movement. On Saturday, Johnson recited to me a now-common refrain.
    He wants to prepare as many people as possible for what he thinks will be the
    greatest shock humanity has ever confronted: our impending replacement by superintelligent
    AI. Once that happens, our species’ only remaining purpose will be to not die—and,
    conveniently, he has already optimized and prepackaged the steps for accomplishing
    this mission (he’ll sell you his purportedly life-extending olive oil, for instance,
    for $30 a bottle). Johnson, in other words, is trying to get people on board with
    using one sort of AI to achieve immortality, all in the service of preventing

    that a lifestyle tailored for one person can save a species. Blueprint cannot

    terms of the present instead of the unknowable future AI will bring about. He
    takes the arrival of superintelligence as a matter of faith, trusting seemingly
    every company in Silicon Valley working to bring such machines into existence.
    Johnson likened the situation to trying to convince a two-dimensional creature
    that a third dimension exists; to telling someone in the 1870s that microscopic
    germs cause disease, or someone in the 16th-century Catholic Church that the Earth
    revolves around the sun. The analogies reminded me of Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai
