    that situation every time, and now git’s default behaviour when your branch has
    diverged from the upstream is to just throw an error and ask you what to do (very
    similar to what `git pull --ff-only` does).

  prefs:

    `push.autoSetupRemote true` also lets you **pull** from the matching remote branch
    (though you do need to push first to set up tracking). `push.default current`
    only lets you push.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I believe the only thing to be careful of with `push.autoSetupRemote true` and
    `push.default current` is that you need to be confident that you’re never going
    to accidentally make a local branch with the same name as an unrelated remote
    branch. Lots of people have branch naming conventions (like `julia/my-change`)
    that make this kind of conflict very unlikely, or just have few enough collaborators
    that branch name conflicts probably won’t happen.
