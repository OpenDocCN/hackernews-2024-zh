    want to release software capable of handling all tax situations from the start
    because that philosophy — build it all, deploy it suddenly — is historically a
    recipe for disaster in projects like this. That was, for instance, what happened
    with [HealthCare.gov](http://HealthCare.gov) in 2013\. Instead of a working product,
    users got so many outages, delays, and crashes that a [grand total of six people](https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2013/12/27/257398910/the-number-6-says-it-all-about-the-healthcare-gov-rollout)

    They include eight states that don’t levy a general income tax (Florida, Nevada,
    New Hampshire, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Washington, and Wyoming), meaning
    there’s no need for the IRS software to integrate with a state tax system. The

    development. Older approaches, sometimes called “plan-based” or [“waterfall,”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterfall_model)

    of that debacle notes that while developers stated they were trying to use agile
    methods, time and resources weren’t available for the kind of rapid iteration
