- en: The Wrongful Death of a Minor Act “applies to all unborn children, regardless
    of their location,” wrote Alabama Supreme Court Justice Jay Mitchell. “[T]he Wrongful
    Death of a Minor Act is sweeping and unqualified. It applies to all children,
    born and unborn, without limitation. It is not the role of this Court to craft
    a new limitation based on our own view of what is or is not wise public policy.
    That is especially true where, as here, the People of this State have adopted
    a Constitutional amendment directly aimed at stopping courts from excluding ‘unborn
    life’ from legal protection.”

    slowly die,” one of the filings stated.
