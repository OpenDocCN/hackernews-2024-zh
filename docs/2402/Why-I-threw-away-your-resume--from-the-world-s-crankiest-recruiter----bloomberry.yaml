    job posting on Linkedin in months. Within 24 hours, I received over 560+ applicants.

    idea of reading 560+ resumes makes me impatient, cynical, and even a bit sadistic.
    After a few hours of shifting through these resumes, I predictably got rid of
    95% of them. Here are 5 reasons why I probably threw your resume in the trash:'

    understand they’re time consuming to write, but that’s your problem – not mine.
    If you’re spraying and praying resumes to a bunch of jobs to be efficient, that’s
    fair. But if there’s a handful of dream jobs that you really want, you need to
    write a cover letter.

    can talk about hiring and managing large teams. That’s *literally* what they do!
    That’s the job description! Telling me all that does nothing to reassure me you’re
    a standout candidate. It doesn’t differentiate you from other candidates applying
    to the job.

    especially if you were an entry-level employee. For instance, if you just have
    2 years of experience, and claim you helped your company make an additional $25M
    in revenue, I’m going to be very skeptical. Because there’s probably no way you
    accomplished what you did. So be specific, quantify your work, but also be honest.

    I really do. But time is money, and I really can’t afford to spend more than a
    minute on your resume. So unless you’re a CEO or President, your resume should
    not be more than 2 pages.
  prefs: []

    you’re a good fit for the job. That’s it. That’s all it needs to do. The initial
    few readers of your resume will be screeners – people who will take a huge list
    of resumes, and trim it into a shorter list. They will match your resume against
    a job description, and will give you less than a minute (at most).'
  prefs: []

    a month to do? Take it out. That side project that you didn’t finish? Omit it.
    Re-read your resume, and ask yourself: ***Does this clearly show I’m a good fit
    to this specific job?*** If the answer is no, just remove it.'

- en: In addition to not being lengthy, make sure your resume isn’t full of walls
    of text. It’s so easy for people to tune them out. Use bullet points instead,
    and list out the main, important details of what you did in each job. Long paragraphs
    are simply a turn off, and when a recruiter/hiring manager is on his 100th resume
    for the day, they’re very likely to just throw your resume when they see them.

    leaving a company, such as a toxic culture, or health reasons. But if you’ve never
    ever held a single job for more than 2 years, it really makes me question whether
    you’re looking to jump to a better opportunity as soon as things get hard. It
    makes me question your resiliency, your grittiness and your mental toughness.
    Look, I just don’t want someone to throw up their hands and give up at the first
    sign of an obstacle, and I’m just not going to take a risk on you, when there’s
    100s of other candidates without this issue.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I know there are certain things you can’t control, so if there’s a good valid
    reason for a short stay in some company, make sure you include it as a bullet
    point. For instance, if the startup you joined had to close shop after a year,
    you could add a bullet point that says “This startup had to shutdown because of
    a lack of funding”.

    I often question whether you’re hiding something, such as a short tenure, or a
    huge gap in employment.

- en: It’s easy to get jaded by the whole job search process. As someone who got rejected
    for ***every single job*** I applied to since 2011, it can sometimes feel exhausting.
    But it’s helpful to think about what’s happening on the other side too. Remember,
    the person reading your resume knows nothing about you, and only has a few seconds
    to make a decision whether you’re a match for the job. So make their lives easier.
    Tell them exactly what makes you unique and a perfect fit for this job. And make
    sure everything in your resume reassures them of that.
