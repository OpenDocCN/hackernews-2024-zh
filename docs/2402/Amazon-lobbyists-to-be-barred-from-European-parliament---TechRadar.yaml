- en: Amazon has faced increasing criticism on the working conditions in its European
    sites and its less than friendly approach to unionionization. Since 2021, the
    ecommerce giant has failed to attend three meetings with the employment and social
    affairs committee, with the most recent meeting being missed due to “short notice”,
    according to a letter from the committee to Robert Metsola, the EU parliament
    president.

    being deprived of the right to represent the interests of European citizens and
    inquire about claims of breaches of fundamental rights enshrined in EU Treaties
    and EU labour laws,” the letter stated.

    decision, as we want to engage constructively with policymakers. As a company
    that has been active in the EU for more than 25 years and now has more than 150,000
    permanent employees here, we take our engagement with policymakers in Brussels
    and across Europe extremely seriously.”
