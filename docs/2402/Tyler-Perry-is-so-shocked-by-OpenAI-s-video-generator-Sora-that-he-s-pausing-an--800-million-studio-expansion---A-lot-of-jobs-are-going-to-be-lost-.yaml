    I’m seeing,” he [told](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/tyler-perry-ai-alarm-1235833276/)
    the *Hollywood Reporter* on Thursday. “I had gotten word over the last year or
    so that this was coming, but I had no idea until I saw recently the demonstrations
    of what it’s able to do. It’s shocking to me.”

    Sora last week, saying the AI tool was available to a “limited number of creators”
    for now. It lets users, with nothing more than a simple text prompt, create 60-second
    videos so realistic that most people wouldn’t guess they were AI-generated.

    become unnecessary to build sets or travel to locations, for instance. But he’s
    also an actor and filmmaker, and in terms of the threat to film and TV jobs, “there’s
    got to be some sort of regulations in order to protect us,” he said. “If not,
    I just don’t see how we survive.”

    “Because as I was looking at it, I immediately started thinking of everyone in
    the industry who would be affected by this, including actors and grip and electric
    and transportation and sound and editors, and looking at this, I’m thinking this
    will touch every corner of our industry.”

    If a pilot that would normally cost $15 million or $35 million can instead be
    done at a fraction of the cost, companies will gravitate to the less expensive
    option, he noted.
