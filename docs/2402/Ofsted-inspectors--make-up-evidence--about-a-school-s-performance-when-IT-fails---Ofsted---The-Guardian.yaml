- en: Ofsted inspectors have been forced to “make up” evidence because the computer
    system they use to record inspections sometimes crashes, ­wiping all the data,
    an *Observer* ­investigation has found.

- en: Since 2018, [inspectors have made live notes on laptops](https://educationinspection.blog.gov.uk/2018/09/07/ofsted-is-going-digital/)
    or tablets as they interview staff and observe ­lessons after Ofsted invested
    in a new ­electronic evidence gathering (EEG) digital platform. However, our investigation
    has discovered the technology has had serious issues from the beginning, sometimes
    crashing unexpectedly and losing all notes from interviews, or even whole days
    of evidence, so that inspectors have to replace those notes from memory without
    telling the school.

    anonymity who said such problems had been “common” for years, and that senior

    *Observer* that chief inspector Sir Martyn Oliver “is initiating a rapid review
    to satisfy himself that the EEG and the guidance to inspectors is robust”. The
    spokesperson added that if schools or inspectors have concerns “we would want
    to hear about them directly, so we can respond appropriately”.

    The idea of inspectors making lost evidence up, or remembering what they can,
    is abhorrent. It’s not how schools are allowed to conduct themselves.” He argued
    that if such a practice has been commonplace, “essentially every inspection conducted
    over the past five years should be disregarded”.'

    However, the *Observer* has seen Ofsted’s written response to a complaint from
    a school about missing evidence. It says: “You state that during the final meeting
    the lead inspector declared: ‘It’s all gone’, referring to the evidence on her
    computer.”'
