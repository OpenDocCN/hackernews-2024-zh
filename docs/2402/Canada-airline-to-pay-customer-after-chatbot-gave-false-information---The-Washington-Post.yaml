- en: After his grandmother died in Ontario a few years ago, British Columbia resident
    Jake Moffatt visited Air Canada’s website to book a flight for the funeral. He
    received assistance from a chatbot, which told him the airline offered reduced
    rates for passengers booking last-minute travel due to tragedies.

- en: Moffatt bought a nearly $600 ticket for a next-day flight after the chatbot
    said he would get some of his money back under the airline’s bereavement policy
    as long as he applied within 90 days, according to a recent civil-resolutions
    tribunal decision.

    chatbot had been wrong. Air Canada only awarded bereavement fees if the request
    had been submitted before a flight. The airline later argued the chatbot wasa
    separate legal entity “responsible for its own actions,” the decision said.

    Air Canada owed Moffatt more than $600 in damages and tribunal fees after failing

    in hopes of providing faster service, the Air Canada dispute sheds light on issues
    associated with the growing technology and how courts could approach questions
    of accountability. The Canadian tribunal in this case came down on the side of
    the customer, ruling that Air Canada did not ensure its chatbot was accurate.

    Canada’s website,” tribunal member Christopher Rivers wrote in his decision. “It
    should be obvious to Air Canada that it is responsible for all the information
    on its website. It makes no difference whether the information comes from a static
    page or a chatbot.”

    to submit your ticket for a reduced bereavement rate, kindly do so within 90 days
    of the date your ticket was issued by completing our Ticket Refund Application
    form,” the chatbot responded, according to the tribunal’s decision.

    prohibits “refunds for travel that has already happened.”

    shouldn’t be liable for the information the chatbot provides, according to the
    tribunal’s decision. Air Canada also contended that Moffatt could have found the
    airline’s bereavement policy by further scanning its website, the decision said.

    information. I find that was reasonable in the circumstances,” Rivers wrote in

    Air Canada’s webpage is accurate, and another is not.”
