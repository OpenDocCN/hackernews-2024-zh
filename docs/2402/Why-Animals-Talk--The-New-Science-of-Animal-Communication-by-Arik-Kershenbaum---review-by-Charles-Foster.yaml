    language (by which we mean our kind of language) as evidence of moral significance.
    But do animals talk? Many traditions assume they do, and understanding animal
    talk has sometimes been thought to indicate great human wisdom. The proverbially
    wise Solomon understood the language of the birds, and St Francis preached to
    them. Most of us have asked what a crow’s squawk or a dog’s whine means.Perhaps
    we ask because we feel that animals can tell us something we don’t know about
    the sort of place this world is.

    Descartes declared that animals were automatons and Enlightenment thinkers duly
    reconceived the cosmos and everything in it, apart from humans, as a machine.
    We humans hung on to our souls for a while, but now we are machines too. The study
    of animal behaviour has long been merely the study of how animals reactto stimuli.
    Ask what they were *thinking* and the journals would reject your article.

    of Cambridge zoologist specialising in the science of animal communication, he
    has studied five – wolves, dolphins, parrots, hyraxes and chimpanzees – of the
    seven species considered in this book in the wild (the other two are gibbons and
    humans). It might seem obvious that animal communication should be studied in
    the wild, but this idea is quite recent and radical. It requires a rejection of
    Descartes’s canonical premise. If a rat is an automaton, it can be studied satisfactorily
    in a laboratory maze.

    animal communication we have to understand the animal societies in which the communication
    occurs. We have to ask *why* animals whistle, grunt and howl. Such activities
    are costly. Natural selection demands a strenuous justification for the outlay.
    On this issue, there are few great surprises in his survey. Wolves howl to mark
    their territory and to keep in touch over long distances; high-ranking male hyraxes
    have complex songs because complexity is a good marker of fitness and is attractive
    to females; gibbon couples sing duets to one another when they wake to keep the
    relationship strong and to declare to listening would-be adulterers that there
    is no chance of an extramarital affair; chimpanzees use many sounds from their
    wide repertoire for political intrigue, for threatening, for coaxing and cajoling,
    and for coordinating monkey hunts; many animal utterances are undifferentiated
    bursts of emotion, rather like human exclamations such as ‘Oh my god’ or ‘What
    on earth?’'

    There is nothing obviously akin to wordsin animal discourse, he says, and though
    syntax – the ordering of sounds – is ubiquitous in animal vocalisations, he dismisses
    the notion of full-blown animal grammar.

    intriguing indications among animals not just of individuation but also of personhood
    (does any dog owner deny it?). Dolphins have individual ‘signature’ whistles which
    say to anyone listening, ‘This is me.’ They respond excitedly when they hear a
    recording of the signature whistle of a dolphin they have not seen for years.
    Mothers use their own whistle to call for lost calves. They’re not quite calling
    out their names, but they’re not far off it.

    that we understand it. This is not realised in the wild because it would not give
    a selective advantage. African grey parrots are the obvious example. One famous
    African grey, Alex, lived in Professor Irene Pepperberg’s lab. Every night, when
    she left for home, he said to her, ‘You be good. I love you. See you tomorrow.’
    That’s not particularly impressive: the parrot could simply have been copying
    her. But Alex could do much more than that. He knew that words related to concepts,
    which is probably a defining element of any true language. If presented with a
    tray of objects of different shapes and colours and made of various materials,
    he would accurately answer questions such as ‘How many triangles?’ or ‘How many
    red squares?’ or ‘How many wood?’ And he learned not just the associations of
    words, but their meanings too. He looked into a mirror and asked, ‘What colour?’
    That was how he learned the word ‘grey’. This has been described as the only known
    example of a non-human asking a direct question. Alex, says Kershenbaum, had ‘the
    core of what is necessary for language’ – and probably ‘that’s an understatement’.'

    but not in the way we do. We are pathologically linguistic. We chop the world
    up into propositions and, if we’re not careful, examine those rather than the
    world itself. The behaviourist Temple Grandin speculates that non-human animals
    might rely on mental images rather than something tantamount to language to conceptualise
    ideas (as people like her, with autism spectrum disorder, do). We can’t know,
    but Kershenbaum is sympathetic to the notion.

    to see it as a humble, genial, scholarly, impeccably clear meditation on our own
    *Umwelt*.He challenges us to consider that there are ways of being in the world
    other than ours. Our old instinct is right: if we learn how to listen properly,
    animals really can tell us something significant about the world that we wouldn’t
    know without them.'
