- en: Wendy’s will start experimenting with surge pricing, much like [Uber and Lyft](https://gizmodo.com/uber-lyft-drivers-get-tips-on-28-rides-in-latest-study-1851264494),
    as the company rolls out digital menus to all its United States restaurants by
    2025, according to the [company’s February earnings call](https://www.irwendys.com/events-and-presentations/default.aspx).
    Under the test, burgers, Frosties, and other menu items will have “dynamic prices,”
    costing more during times of increased demand.

- en: “Beginning as early as 2025, we will begin testing more enhanced features like
    dynamic pricing,” said Wendy’s CEO Kirk Tanner on Feb. 15’s earnings call. “We
    are planning to invest approximately $20 million to roll out digital menu boards
    to all US company-operated restaurants by the end of 2025.”

    much as you’d like. Consumers are familiar with surge pricing through rideshare
    services like Uber and Lyft, where prices fluctuate significantly depending on
    demand. Dynamic pricing is a relatively new concept in the fast-food world, with
    little precedent. The fluid prices change given supply, demand, competitor pricing,
    and other external factors that can be algorithmically calculated.

    that price could fluctuate throughout the day. The burger could increase in price
    around lunchtime or go down during a slow afternoon. Wendy’s did not provide details
    as to how severely prices could fluctuate.

- en: Tanner expects dynamic pricing will result in immediate sales growth, but it’s
    a risky approach. A majority of consumers (52%) say dynamic pricing is equivalent
    to price gouging, and 65% say it makes the decision of where to eat more difficult,
    according to a [Capterra survey](https://www.capterra.com/resources/dynamic-pricing-for-restaurants/#methodology).

    bag. The company had plans to unveil an [AI chatbot powered drive-thru](https://gizmodo.com/wendys-ai-chatbot-fast-food-drive-thru-burgers-1850418280)
    back in May. However, it later came out that the secret technology behind some
    of these experiences [was really just humans](https://gizmodo.com/secret-behind-ai-drive-thrus-fast-food-humans-1851085269).
    The company also announced [a fleet of tunnel-dwelling, self-driving robots](https://gizmodo.com/wendys-underground-robots-fetch-fast-food-orders-1850451165)
    to help deliver your order in 2023.

    and won’t mind when it hits the dinner plate. The company notes that this will
    just be a test to start, made possible by their digital menus.

- en: A Wendy’s spokesperson told Gizmodo Tuesday its dynamic pricing will also enable
    discounts at slow times of the day. The fast food chain says these changes will
    “drive traffic” during slow parts of the day. Wendy’s did not comment on higher
    prices during peak hours but confirmed these changes could be coming as early
    as next year.
