- en: Epik.com has been for years the go-to domain registrar for websites that other
    companies refuse to do business with. Sites dedicated to white nationalism, QAnon
    conspiracy theories, and harassing transgender people were all welcomed by Epik.
    Now, it appears that Epik’s new owner may abandon the extremist fringe and shift
    its customer base toward companies seeking to operate in the shadows.

- en: Rob Monster, a born-again Christian who founded Epik in 2009, had been key in
    keeping many of the most extreme websites online. He often went to great lengths
    to personally defend the sites and extolled the virtues of free speech. Epik was
    sold to new ownership last year after the company unraveled amid allegations of
    gross financial mismanagement.

- en: An accounting firm hired by Epik to conduct a forensic investigation alleged
    that Monster had misappropriated more than $3.5 million, according to an internal
    preliminary report obtained by WIRED. More than $1.5 million was attributed to
    Monster personally withdrawing funds from the company. Nearly $2 million of Epik
    funds was used in Kingdom Ventures, Monsters’ venture capital firm, according
    to the report.

    mission in life to be invisible,” said one. “He’s someone who likes to operate
    in the shadows,” claims another. Keen is a serial entrepreneur who previously
    ran a lawn care and tree-trimming business, according to public records.
