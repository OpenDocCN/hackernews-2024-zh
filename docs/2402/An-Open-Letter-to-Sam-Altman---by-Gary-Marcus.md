# An Open Letter to Sam Altman - by Gary Marcus

*Sam Altman took to X this morning to defend his $7 trillion fundraising ask against the likes of me, writing “[you can grind to help secure our collective future or you can write substacks about why we are going fail](https://x.com/sama/status/1756729885215900006?s=20)”.*

*I have questions, lot of questions*:

Dear Sam,

Why do you think that LLMs are going to “secure our collective future”? (Are you working on any technology other than LLMs?)

As Casey Newton recently argued “[Generative AI clearly has many positive, creative uses... But looking back over the past year, it's clear that any benefits we have seen today have come at a high cost.](https://www.platformer.news/taylor-swift-deepfake-nudes-x/?ref=platformer-newsletter)”

How do we know that $7 trillion invested into LLMs and their infrastructure would not simply *exacerbate* those costs, grinding down content creators, women, and the environment, undermining democracy, destroying jobs, etc?

$7T might serve OpenAI well, and raise your public profile, but would it serve humanity? How certain of that bet can we be? What's the rush? (Also, what has the $100 billion grind on driverless cars brought society? Might people have rushed in too soon, technology-wise?)

The risk of premature commitment looms large.
