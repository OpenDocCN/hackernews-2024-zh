- en: In today's computing ecosystem, I would very much be considered a cloud-native
    engineer. My first job in the industry saw me deploying cloud hosted platforms
    on Rackspace and AWS infrastructure, and I have been specializing in AWS ever
    since. To me, highly available cloud deployments are the basics, the norm, a common
    standard that is easy to implement.

    and terraform. I haven't had the opportunity to work heavily with kubernetes and
    containerization yet, but I am trained on it and ready to roll. Even in my college
    days, I was fascinated with virtualized compute, using VMs I didn't really understand
    to host various services in lab and home networks.

    my chosen professional environments, GNU/Linux, Windows, and MacOS (at the time
    still called OSX) were, likewise, mystic magics of the highest order. Assembly
    language programming was out of the question and low level C code was unreadable
    to me.

    highly available, self-healing, auto-deploying virtual networks of nodes and services,
    I remained mostly ignorant of the details of how the host systems and virtual
    systems actually function.

    In my career I've seen that this is not a situation unique to myself, and that
    the vast majority of cloud engineers simply do not understand, nor wish to understand,
    hardware, kernel, and driver level coding.

    skills are cut off. Many technicians in the industry do not know how to use system
    tools to trace kernel calls and other low level data that may assist in locating
    things like memory leaks or faults.

    level coding practitioners. Web Devs may feel called out, but I think most of
    them will agree that the messy internals of operating system administration is
    far beyond the scope of skills they wish to master. This leaves us in a place
    where even expert developers simply don't understand how the environment they
    code for will behave at scale.

- en: The difference in performance between code on a workstation and code in a high
    scale production environment must be tested as part of the deployment pipeline,
    to ensure we don't introduce inefficiencies that can bring down the service. This
    is typically handled by specialists known as SRE's or Site Reliability Engineers;
    a fancy DevOps title held by many cloud-native specialists. It takes a team of
    experts to build a web service of any complexity, with specialists in each field
    working together to create something functional.

    I must acknowledge, of course, that they do exist. I have met and learned from
    a handful of experts who began their careers in eras where 8-bit computing was
    the most advanced standard; and these technicians understand the platform from
    its lowest bits to its most obfuscated user-space applications. Windows specialists,
    in particular, seem to have a higher propensity for exposure to the lowest level
    hardware concepts early in their careers.

    live with the limitations of windows if you have mastered controlling the system
    with low level tools in that environment. That might be revealing a bit too much
    of how I feel about Microsoft's operating environment, though.

- en: Again we circle back around to the importance of 8-bit computing in the educational
    space. Because 8-bit systems work the same ways, physically, as 32 and 64-bit
    systems, while remaining much simpler to design, implement, and understand, it
    serves as a perfect platform for teaching.

- en: Computer science education needs to embrace 8-bit computing standards in schools
    in order to increase computer literacy across the population. As we become increasingly
    reliant on computer technology – tying it into almost every aspect of human life
    – it becomes increasingly important to ensure computer literacy thrives. Without
    an educated population, it will be too easy for organizations and governments
    to control the means of computing; denying equitable access to end-users and developers.

    lacking in the skills that got us there. A cloud technician educated in low level
    computing is a well equipped cloud technician; one who can likely be relied upon
    for efficient designs. If you are, yourself, struggling with low level computing
    concepts, even while operating at high levels in the cloud space, please consider
    following my journey as I educate myself and others about low-level computing
    concepts using 8-bit technologies!
