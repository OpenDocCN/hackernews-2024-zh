    to create packages that are compatible with both Deno and Node when you can just
    make a Node package? ***It’s still going to be compatible with both Deno and Node.***
    Deno themselves have seen to that. You’re going to get cross-runtime compatibility
    either way.

    developers are likely to reach for *aren’t going to be based on JavaScript*. Import
    maps mean that browsers effectively have an API surface that non-JS projects can
    use to build a dependency management system. Much of the tooling surrounding JavaScript
    is now implemented in *Rust*, not JS – much of it driven by Deno itself – and
    that makes it more easily accessible outside both the Node and Deno ecosystems.
    [The WASM component model](https://component-model.bytecodealliance.org/) additionally
    promises to make many dependencies runtime-independent, with the Rust-based tooling
    around JS being logical initial targets.
