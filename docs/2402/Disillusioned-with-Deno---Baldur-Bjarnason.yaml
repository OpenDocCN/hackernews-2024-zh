    you start to rethink and review other decisions you’ve made in the past.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One of those decisions is [Deno](https://deno.com/), which I’ve used to most
    of my personal projects and experiments over the past couple of years. Most of
    these projects have been on the simpler side – command-line scripts or small websites.
    I made the [softwarecrisis.dev](https://softwarecrisis.dev/) newsletter landing
    page using [Lume and Deno](https://lume.land/), for example. I used Deno to make
    most of the prototypes for the research project that followed [Colophon Cards](https://www.colophon.cards/).
    It’s very useful.

  prefs:
  - PREF_OL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    new runtime and hosting environment, so you need to implement your own to fill
    in the gaps.
  prefs:
  - PREF_OL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Then you discover that the biggest demand for hosting is from clients with legacy
    code and legacy dependencies, so you kind of have to give them a way to bring
    them over. Compatibility it is.
  prefs:
  - PREF_OL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Turns out many of the annoying features of the “legacy” system existed for a
    reason, so you have to implement them yourself, but you obviously do so in newer,
    modern, more sensible (and less backwards-compatible) ways.
  prefs:
  - PREF_OL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This would be fine – great even – if it weren’t for the fact that you now have
    to maintain ***two*** versions of large parts of your runtime, either as a translation
    layer from the “legacy” system to your new one, or as two completely independent
    features that require maintenance.

    started on the opposite end of this particular chain of sausages: cloud hosting
    first, then [the open source runtime](https://blog.cloudflare.com/workers-open-source-announcement/),
    not the other way around as Deno did.'

    but the overall strategy for the two companies is the same.

- en: I don’t think this approach is going to work out that well for any of them.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The “legacy” compatibility effectively removes any incentive to make packages
    for Deno (or Cloudflare, or Bun). Why use [`dnt`](https://github.com/denoland/dnt)
    to create packages that are compatible with both Deno and Node when you can just
    make a Node package? ***It’s still going to be compatible with both Deno and Node.***
    Deno themselves have seen to that. You’re going to get cross-runtime compatibility
    either way.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The risk is that Deno will effectively become a platform for running code and
    projects from the npm ecosystem. Except it will never be as good at “node” as
    node itself.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    *node is a moving target*. It’s a living project that’s still changing.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If Deno were maintained by a foundation or open source community, I’d be less
    worried. It’d inevitably be smaller in scope, but that would be fine. You don’t
    need world domination to be a successful community-driven software project. It
    could find its niche, with time.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But you do need to conquer a big chunk of the world to be a successful VC-funded
    startup.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There is already a disconnect in the Deno ecosystem. Many of the third party
    modules seem to be stagnant and haven’t been updated in a while. The projects
    that do seem vibrant tend to be the ones that target browser-compatible platforms
    in general and so get Deno, Cloudflare, and Bun support almost for free through
    little specific effort of their own.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Node hasn’t been standing still either. They’re adding support for many of the
    features that made Deno special, such as built-in tooling, a [test runner with
    coverage](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/test.html), and [HTTP imports](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/esm.html#https-and-http-imports).
    Even [import maps](https://github.com/nodejs/loaders#milestone-3-usability-improvements)
    are on their roadmap.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The fate of Node also doesn’t depend on the fate of a single startup or tech
    company.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The npm ecosystem remains a strategic liability, but adding support for import
    maps and HTTP imports will go some way to mitigate that and in the meantime you
    can install node packages [directly from git](https://medium.com/pravin-lolage/how-to-use-your-own-package-from-git-repository-as-a-node-module-8b543c13957e)
    or use an npm-compatible third party repository. [Any git remote URL should work
    with `npm install`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v10/commands/npm-install#:~:text=npm%20install%20%3Cgit%20remote%20url%3E)
    – no GitHub required.

- en: Seeing money and talent drain out of the software ecosystem, companies switch
    en masse to inherently conservative LLMs for development, and a growing frustration
    among software developers in general, it’s hard to envision a future where Deno
    or Bun win out in a direct competition with Node.

    our best bet for the back end in the long term.

    to work with.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The big one is that the logical alternatives to Node – the “no Node” work environments
    developers are likely to reach for *aren’t going to be based on JavaScript*. Import
    maps mean that browsers effectively have an API surface that non-JS projects can
    use to build a dependency management system. Much of the tooling surrounding JavaScript
    is now implemented in *Rust*, not JS – much of it driven by Deno itself – and
    that makes it more easily accessible outside both the Node and Deno ecosystems.
    [The WASM component model](https://component-model.bytecodealliance.org/) additionally
    promises to make many dependencies runtime-independent, with the Rust-based tooling
    around JS being logical initial targets.

    instead *something completely different.*
