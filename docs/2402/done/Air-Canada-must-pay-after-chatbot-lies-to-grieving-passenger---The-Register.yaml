- en: Jake Moffatt took the airline to a small-claims tribunal after the biz refused
    to refund him for flights he booked from Vancouver to Toronto following the death
    of his grandmother in November last year. Before he bought the tickets, he researched
    Air Canada's bereavement fares – special low rates for those traveling due to
    the loss of an immediate family member – by querying its website chatbot.

  zh: 杰克·莫法特在去年11月他祖母去世后，因航空公司拒绝为他从温哥华到多伦多的航班退款而将航空公司告上了小额索赔仲裁庭。在购买机票之前，他通过查询航空公司的网站聊天机器人来调查加拿大航空的丧亲优惠票价
    - 针对因直系亲属去世而旅行的人士的特别低价。
- en: The virtual assistant told him that if he purchased a normal-price ticket he
    would have up to 90 days to claim back a bereavement discount. Following that
    advice, Moffatt booked a one-way CA$794.98 ticket to Toronto, presumably to attend
    the funeral or be with family, and later an CA$845.38 flight back to Vancouver.

  zh: 这位虚拟助手告诉他，如果他购买普通票，他将有多达90天的时间来要求追回丧亲折扣。根据这一建议，莫法特预订了一张去多伦多的单程票，价格为CA$794.98，据推测是为了参加葬礼或与家人团聚，后来又预订了一张返回温哥华的CA$845.38的航班。
- en: He also spoke to an Air Canada representative who confirmed he would be able
    to get a bereavement discount on his flights and that he should expect to pay
    roughly $380 to get to Toronto and back. Crucially, the rep didn't say anything
    about being able to claim the discount as money back after purchasing a ticket.

  zh: 他还与一名加拿大航空代表交谈，确认他将能够在他的航班上获得丧亲折扣，并且他应该预计要支付大约$380去多伦多和返回。关键是，该代表没有提到在购买机票后能够要求退款的事情。

    his grandmother's death certificate, all well within that 90-day window, Air Canada
    turned him down.

  zh: 当莫法特后来提交了他的退款申请，并在90天的窗口期内包括了他祖母的死亡证明副本时，加拿大航空拒绝了他。
- en: Staff at the airline told him bereavement fare rates can't be claimed back after
    having already purchased flights, a policy at odds with what the support chatbot
    told Moffatt. It's understood the virtual assistant was automated, and not a person
    sat at a keyboard miles away.
