- en: When she died at a hundred and one in January of 2019, Diana Athill had publicly
    chronicled both ends of her long life in a series of nine memoirs. The first of
    these, “[Instead of a Letter](https://www.amazon.com/Instead-Letter-Diana-Athill/dp/168137613X),”
    was published in 1963 and recently rereleased in the U.S. as part of the NYRB
    Classics series; it recounts her jolly, upper-class English childhood on the family
    estate of Ditchingham, in Norfolk. The last book that she wrote, “[Alive, Alive
    Oh!](https://www.amazon.com/Alive-Oh-Other-Things-Matter/dp/0393353567),” came
    together in her “darling little room” at the Mary Feilding Guild, in Highgate,
    London, a garden-set home for the elderly; it’s a high-spirited, recalcitrant
    account of “waiting to die” at ninety-six.

  zh: 当她在2019年1月去世时，戴安娜·阿西尔公开记录了她漫长一生的两个端点，这在她的九本回忆录中得以体现。其中第一本，[《Instead of a Letter》](https://www.amazon.com/Instead-Letter-Diana-Athill/dp/168137613X)，于1963年出版，并最近在美国作为纽约评论图书经典系列的一部分重新出版；它讲述了她在诺福克郡迪奇汉姆家族庄园度过的快乐、上流社会的英国童年。她写的最后一本书，《[Alive,
    Alive Oh!](https://www.amazon.com/Alive-Oh-Other-Things-Matter/dp/0393353567)》，在伦敦海盖特的玛丽·菲尔丁公会的“可爱小房间”里完成；这是一部充满活力、桀骜不驯的关于在九十六岁“等待死亡”的叙述。

    she went. First, because she would have bewitchingly written off any high praise—the
    New York *Times* [noted](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/24/obituaries/diana-athill-dead-british-author.html)
    “her luminous prose, gimlet social acuity and ability to convey a profound sense
    of place”—with her brand of droll humor. (She refused burial at the Highgate Cemetery
    because of the cost: “I think being dead is an expensive business.”) And, second,
    because she would have enjoyed the evidence of how much her reputation had emerged;
    she’d worked behind the scenes for meagre wages and little adulation as one of
    the century’s great editors. In 1952, she became a co-founding director of the
    publishing house André Deutsch, and, until her retirement, in 1992, shepherded
    the likes of Philip Roth, John Updike, and Jean Rhys to publication. Athill wrote
    seven of her memoirs after leaving her nine-to-five, but, until that relatively
    late turn toward autobiographical mania, she knew her place. “We must always remember
    that we are only midwives—if we want praise for progeny we must give birth to
    our own,” she writes, in “[Stet: An Editor’s Life](https://www.amazon.com/Stet-Editors-Life-Diana-Athill/dp/1783787465).”

    （她拒绝在哈伊盖特公墓安葬，因为费用太高：“我认为死是一件昂贵的事。”）其次，因为她会享受证据表明她的声誉有多么突出；她曾在幕后工作，为微薄的工资和少得可怜的赞美，成为世纪伟大编辑之一。1952年，她成为出版社安德烈·德意志的创始董事之一，并在1992年退休前，指导了菲利普·罗斯、约翰·厄普代克和琼·赖斯等人的出版。阿西尔在离开九点到五点的工作后写了七本回忆录，但是，在那个相对较晚的转向自传狂热之前，她知道自己的位置。“我们必须始终记住，我们只是接生婆——如果我们想要后代的赞美，我们必须自己生下来，”她在《[Stet:

    memoirs. But Athill doesn’t write as if no one is watching; she writes as if she’d
    never even imagined someone might watch, and therefore doesn’t have a scruple
    to hold on to. To describe honesty as her hallmark isn’t quite enough: that’s
    the least we can ask of our memoirists. What she is marvellous at is admitting,
    sans self-recrimination. In the early twenty-first century, the memoir has turned
    into a confessional, in a nearly religious sense. Writers go there to seek redemption,
    and to chart their evolution from naïve to knowing: no narrative is more marketable
    than metamorphosis. Athill doesn’t treat her foibles and losses—of love, of money,
    of caste, of certainty—as traumas, events that would define her life as troubled
    and scarring. Instead, she makes the case that being kicked out of Eden is good
    for the soul.'

  zh: 评论家经常用“坦率”或“直率”来描述阿西尔的回忆录。但阿西尔写作时并不是没有人在看；她写作时好像从未想象过会有人在看，因此也没有什么顾忌可言。将诚实描述为她的标志还不够：这是我们对自己的回忆录作者能要求到的最低限度。她擅长的是承认，没有自责。在二十一世纪初，回忆录已经变成了一种忏悔，几乎是一种宗教意义上的忏悔。作家们去那里寻求救赎，并记录他们从幼稚到睿智的演变过程：没有比变形更具市场价值的叙述了。阿西尔并不把自己的过失和损失——爱情的损失，金钱的损失，种姓的损失，确定性的损失——看作是创伤，看作是会使她的一生饱受困扰和痛苦的事件。相反，她提出了这样一个观点：被赶出伊甸园对灵魂有好处。
- en: “I am glad that I have not inherited money or possessions,” Athill writes, striking
    a defiant note, in “Instead of a Letter.” Inheritance was never her due, though
    as a child she once counted the bodies that stood between her and the palatial
    Ditchingham estate. “It appeared that at least twelve people, seven of them my
    contemporaries, would have to die before I would have a claim, and I hardly thought
    I ought to pray for this however much I would have liked to.” Ditchingham belonged
    to her mother’s parents, who offered it out as the extended family’s seasonal
    home, where they spent long summers and holidays throughout her early life. The
    thousand-acre estate with a twenty-bedroom, fully staffed house granted the family
    security in their Englishness, as members of an élite and unquestionable class.
    Athill stresses that the experience of growing up with such surety turned Ditchingham
    into a cocoon, a secure location from which to launch a life, but also a place
    she would inevitably leave. “There I used to be,” she opines, “as snug and as
    smug as anyone.” From an early age, she knew that adulthood would exist elsewhere.

  zh: “我很高兴我没有继承金钱或财产，”Athill在《信替》中写道，发出挑衅的声音。继承从来不是她的权利，尽管她曾在童年时数过多少人身在她和宏伟的Ditchingham庄园之间。“显然，至少必须有十二个人，其中七人是我的同辈，才能死去，我才有权利，但我几乎认为我不应该为此祈祷，无论我有多想。”Ditchingham属于她母亲的父母，他们将其作为家族季节性的住宅，并在她的早年生活中度过漫长的夏日和假期。这座占地一千英亩，拥有二十个卧室，设有全体员工的房子为这个家族提供了他们英国人的安全感，作为一个精英且不可置疑的阶层成员。Athill强调，与这样确定性一起长大的经历将Ditchingham变成了一个蚕茧，一个安全的地点来启动生活，但也是一个她最终会离开的地方。“在那里，我会像任何人一样，”她说，“一样舒适和自满。”她从小就知道成年会在别处度过。
- en: 'Athill’s joy in Ditchingham, the children’s after-tea appearance in front of
    the grownups in the drawing room and the horsemen wandering across the fields,
    is the bright marrow of her writing: it suffuses her later life, and her prose,
    with bubbling, fresh oxygen. But, in “Instead of a Letter,” she writes as if she’s
    relieved that she got away from the estate and its inhabitants. “Like anyone else
    they had their charms,” she writes of her family, but “physically, intellectually,
    and morally, they were no more than middling.” Yet they thought themselves superior
    beings: “Smugness is too small a word for what it feels like *from inside*. From
    inside, it feels like moral and aesthetic *rightness*; from inside, it is people
    like me, who question it, who look stupid, ugly, and pitiful.”'

  zh: Athill在Ditchingham的快乐，孩子们在成年人面前出现在客厅里，马匹在田野间漫步，这是她写作的灵感之源：它渗透在她的晚年生活和散文中，为其注入了持续的新鲜氧气。但是，在《信替》中，她写道仿佛庆幸自己摆脱了庄园及其居民。“正如其他人一样，他们有魅力，”她写道，但是在身体上、智力上和道德上，他们仅仅是中等水平。”然而，他们认为自己是优越的存在：“自满这个词太小了，无法表达从内心的感受。从内心来看，它感觉像是道德和审美上的正确性；从内心来看，像我这样质疑它的人显得愚蠢、丑陋和可悲。”
- en: 'Hence her happiness that she didn’t inherit: staying on at Ditchingham for
    a lifetime might have trapped her in the same small, closed life. Her childhood
    remained blissful to her as she aged because it lived on in her memory but didn’t
    define her future. “Never to have broken through its smothering folds would have
    been, I have always thought, extremely depressing,” she writes. “But on the other
    hand, not to have enjoyed a childhood wrapped warmly in those folds—that would
    be a sad loss.” Cousins were saddled with managing the finances of an upkeep-heavy

- en: Ditchingham wasn’t the only inheritance that Athill would forgo. At thirteen,
    her mother told her that they’d “lost” their money, but what she meant was that
    they’d spent it all. “My parents felt they were living austerely because we ourselves
    looked after our ponies and they had not kept on their own hunters,” Athill writes,
    dryly. She recounts her mother telling her that “the really *bloody* thing about
    being poor is that if you leave something on the floor when you go out, you know
    that it *will still be there* when you get back.” Along with her two younger siblings,
    the family had been living in a well-staffed, six-bedroom house in Hertfordshire
    since her father had retired from the Army. Financially, they fell out a window
    but landed on a mattress—Athill’s grandparents rented them Manor Farm, a house
    on the estate, for cheap. A governess cost too much, so Athill was sent to Runton,
    a girls’ boarding school on the North Sea, and then up to St. Mary’s College at
    Oxford, in 1936.

  zh: Ditchingham不是Athill放弃的唯一遗产。十三岁时，她母亲告诉她他们“失去了”他们的钱，但她的意思是他们已经花光了。“我的父母觉得他们生活得很朴素，因为我们自己照看我们的小马，他们也没有养猎人，”Athill干巴巴地写道。她回忆起母亲告诉她“贫穷真*该死*的一件事就是如果你出门时在地板上留下了东西，你知道当你回来的时候它*依然在那里*。”除了她的两个年幼的兄弟姐妹，自从她的父亲退休退出军队后，这个家庭一直住在海特福德郡一个设有全职员工的六卧室的房子里。经济上，他们从窗户跌落，但却落在了床上——Athill的祖父母为他们租了Manor
    Farm，这是庄园上一处廉价的房子。家庭教师太贵了，所以Athill被送到了Runton，一个位于北海的女子寄宿学校，然后于1936年进入牛津圣玛丽学院。

    for two years when her fiancé, a Royal Air Force pilot named Tony Irvine, was
    deployed to Egypt. Then his letters suddenly stopped. She discovered in rapid
    succession that he’d married someone else while abroad and then been killed in
    action. “A long, flat unhappiness” set in, her sense of her own value collapsed,
    and her twenties were filled with broken-off relationships with incompatible men.
    “By the time I had reached my thirties,” she writes, toward the end of “Instead
    of a Letter,” “I was convinced that I lacked some vital quality necessary to inspire
    love.” At age ninety-nine, she explained in an interview, “there was a basic,
    underlying sense of failure—and it came from the very simple thing of having been

    in the office, from ever owning a home, from taking on her share of the André
    Deutsch business—“I loathed and still loathe responsibility”), but it’s obvious
    from her meticulous memory for real-life and fictional plot twists that she vigorously,
    brilliantly doted on language and narrative. The picture that emerges is that
    of a busy editor, pencil in hand, her head bent over the page to keep office politics
    out of her line of sight. She rejects the notion that single women ought to be
    married to their careers: “The working breakfast, and taking home work at weekends . . .
    were to me an abomination.” Here was a woman who’d found the elusive balance,
    or dismissed the idea entirely.'

  zh: 在出版行业工作是另一种幸福地生活在她那个时代的限制之外的方式。退休后，她出版了《Stet》，在其中冷嘲热讽地写道：“这是一个老旧的前编辑想象自己会感觉好一点，如果有一些人读了它。”
    这是一堆矛盾：Athill经常表达自己的懒惰（这让她无法为办公室里的女性争取更好的工资，从未拥有过房子，也从未承担安德烈·德意志（André Deutsch）业务的一份额，“我讨厌并且仍然讨厌责任”），但从她对现实生活和虚构情节转折的细致记忆中可以明显看出，她对语言和叙事热爱而且充满活力、光彩照人。描绘出来的画面是一个忙碌的编辑，手里拿着铅笔，头低下来看着页面，以保持对办公室政治的无视。她反对单身女性应该为自己的事业而结婚的观念：“工作早餐和周末带工作回家……对我来说是一种憎恶。”
    这是一个找到了难以捉摸的平衡，或完全否定了这个想法的女人。
