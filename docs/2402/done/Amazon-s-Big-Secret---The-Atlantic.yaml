    large losses in another. In her classic 1904 exposé of Standard Oil, Ida Tarbell,
    the mother of investigative journalism, described how John D. Rockefeller’s company
    would sell below cost in a given region until it drove the competition out of
    business, sustaining those losses by charging exorbitant prices in places where
    the monopoly was already established. In the 1930s and ’40s, General Electric
    likewise relied on excess profits from its [light-bulb monopoly](https://www.jstor.org/stable/3116940)

    profit margins impossible to calculate.) Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway operates
    dozens of companies across many industries but reports results for only [seven](https://www.berkshirehathaway.com/2022ar/2022ar.pdf)

    In a competitive market, other shopping platforms would lure away sellers by offering
    lower fees and accepting lower profits. (As Bezos himself once put it, “Your margin
    is my opportunity.”) This, in turn, would force Amazon to cut its fees, setting
    off price competition to the benefit of sellers and, ultimately, consumers. But
    this isn’t happening, the FTC alleges, because Amazon uses illegal tactics to
    keep sellers locked into its platform. The whole theory places a lot of weight

    the government will have a harder time proving that it’s a monopoly in violation

    FTC 声称，这并没有发生，因为亚马逊使用非法手段将卖家锁定在其平台上。整个理论对那些被删除的利润率赋予了很大的权重。如果亚马逊在电子商务中勉强维持下来，政府将更难以证明其是违反反垄断法的垄断企业。但是如果
    FTC 是正确的——如果亚马逊确实从其市场获得巨额利润——那么这个案子看起来就更有说服力了。当案件的法官考虑将多少诉讼材料公开时，亚马逊选择不提出异议，而是同意公开大部分投诉中的被删除材料。但是亚马逊辩称，公开其卖家市场的利润数字将会有害，因为这些信息“可能被亚马逊的竞争对手用来针对亚马逊的业务”。法官同意保持这个以及其他数字的保密。

    the SEC’s current parameters, and compel disclosure if they aren’t. Better policing
    of corporate disclosures by the SEC won’t solve America’s monopoly problem, of
    course. But if lawmakers, enforcers, and the public had known more, sooner, about
    how the dominant tech platforms make their money, things might look different
    today. There would have been more informed reporting and public scrutiny of their
    business models. Antitrust enforcers might have intervened earlier. Maybe the
    internet wouldn’t seem so broken.

  zh: SEC 可以通过采用新规定来阻止这种情况，更明确地定义什么算是一个业务部门，并取消对高管的自由裁量权。它还应调查主导性企业是否符合 SEC 目前的参数，并在他们不符合时强制披露。当然，SEC
    对公司披露的更好监管并不能解决美国的垄断问题。但如果立法者、执法者和公众更早了解了主导科技平台如何盈利的信息，今天的情况可能会有所不同。对他们商业模式的报道和公众审查会更具深度。反垄断执法者可能会更早介入。也许互联网看起来就不会如此混乱了。
- en: 'Amazon denies the allegations against it, of course, and will have its day
    in court. The company argues that it offers the best prices and best service for
    customers and third-party sellers alike. Is that true? That question would be
    a lot easier to answer if we could see the profit margin Amazon makes from its
    marketplace. But, for now, no one outside Amazon knows what that number is—except
    the FTC, which had to launch a massive federal antitrust investigation to get
    at it. Those redacted figures will go a long way to determining whether Khan’s
    theories are correct—and whether the FTC can persuade a federal judge to order
    a breakup of the company. In the meantime, the rest of us will remain where we’ve
    been all along: in the dark.'

  zh: 亚马逊当然否认针对它的指控，并将在法庭上辩护。该公司声称为客户和第三方卖家提供了最优惠的价格和最佳的服务。这是真的吗？如果我们能够看到亚马逊从其市场获利的利润率，那个问题会容易得多。但是，目前除了
    FTC 外，没有人知道这个数字是多少，而 FTC 不得不启动大规模的联邦反垄断调查才能得知。这些被编辑的数字将在很大程度上决定汗的理论是否正确，以及 FTC
    是否能说服联邦法官下令分拆这家公司。与此同时，我们其他人将继续停留在一贯的位置：在黑暗中。
