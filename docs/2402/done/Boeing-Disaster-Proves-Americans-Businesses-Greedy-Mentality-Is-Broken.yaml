    a blown-out door plug, and 177 people who will probably need therapy for the rest
    of their lives. But as the iconic American plane manufacturer tries to make amends

    the past 40 years. The company relentlessly disgorged cash to shareholders when
    it could’ve spent it on building a better (and safer) product. Investments that
    could’ve benefited employees, communities, and other corporate stakeholders were
    often sacrificed at the altar of efficiency and free cash flow. Boeing focused

    maximize shareholder value,” the University of Massachusetts economist William
    Lazonick told me. “It’s so ingrained in their thinking they don’t understand the
    problem itself. It’s built into the structure of these companies.”Simply changing
    CEOs or hiring more engineers won’t make Boeing’s problems go away. The company
    needs to rethink its very reason for existing and what it should provide to society
    as an enterprise. A good American company isn’t just a vehicle for financial returns;
    it is first and foremost an employer, a contributor to economic and/or technological
    innovation, and a source of US power. Whether the recent disasters shake Boeing
    out of its somnambulance remains unclear. It’s also questionable whether other
    major companies with a similar maximize-shareholder-value-at-all-costs ethos will
    learn from the mistakes. But it’s clear that what Boeing — and the entire American
    corporate body politic — needs is nothing short of a philosophical counterrevolution.

    with an engineering background, was replaced by Frank Shrontz, an attorney and
    businessman. The choice was a signal to Wall Street that engineering excesses
    would be curbed in favor of cost discipline and investor rewards. Lazonick’s research
    indicates that from 1998 to 2018, Boeing did $61 billion worth of share buybacks
    to pump its stock price and paid out $29.3 billion in dividends. Over these three
    decades of plenty for Boeing’s shareholders, the company’s staff was asked to
    penny-pinch. An investigation into battery fires on Boeing’s 787 Dreamliner in
    2013 found that it wasn’t allowing engineers to stress test its products enough,
    that it wasn’t catching manufacturing defects, and that passengers could be in
    danger as a result. But he finance guys loved Boeing’s new focus, and the C-suite
    — which receives the lion's share of its compensation in stock — loved it too.
    In the first quarter of 2019, Boeing announced a $2.7 billion stock buyback, and

    America. But a corporation can run on past innovation only for so long. In 2018,

    Average because of the work Welch did to hollow it out. During the first few years
    of his tenure he fired a quarter of the company and continued to fire 10% of the
    workforce annually thereafter. He was such a fan of sending factories abroad —
    to American unions’ ire — that he infamously said, ''Ideally, you'd have every

    and time again — one of those, of course, being Welch. Even after he left the
    company, his pay package was so avaricious that the Securities and Exchange Commission

- en: The problem is it’s hard to see how corporate behavior has actually changed
    since then. Look at General Motors. Right now, the company is trying to keep up
    in a global race to electrify the car industry. If there was any time to focus
    on productive investments over shareholders’ wallets, this would be it. When the
    United Auto Workers union went on strike in September, CEO Mary Barra [warned
    workers](https://www.ineteconomics.org/perspectives/blog/how-gms-10-billion-buyback-may-ice-its-ev-transition)
    that it would cost the company money that should be invested in that transition.
    But in November, after the strike, she announced a $10 billion stock buyback,
    the company's largest share-repurchase plan and a larger sum [than it gave its
    workers](https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/gm-buy-back-10-billion-shares-cut-cruise-spending-2023-11-29/).
    The size of the buybacks is even more staggering when you consider that the company
    promised to spend $35 billion total on developing EVs from 2020 to 2025.

  zh: 问题在于，很难看出企业行为实际上有何改变。看看通用汽车公司吧。眼下，该公司正在全球电动汽车行业的竞争中努力跟上。如果有任何时机能够将重点放在生产性投资上而不是股东的钱包上，那么现在就是时候了。当联合汽车工人工会在九月举行罢工时，首席执行官玛丽·巴拉[警告工人](https://www.ineteconomics.org/perspectives/blog/how-gms-10-billion-buyback-may-ice-its-ev-transition)说这将花费公司应该投资于转型的资金。但是在十一月，罢工结束后，她宣布了一项价值100亿美元的股票回购计划，这是公司规模最大的股份回购计划，也比[给予工人的金额](https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/gm-buy-back-10-billion-shares-cut-cruise-spending-2023-11-29/)更大。考虑到公司承诺从2020年到2025年在发展电动汽车上总共花费350亿美元的金额，这次回购的规模甚至更令人震惊。
- en: Companies like GM and Boeing are crucial to the American economy. Their success
    keeps people employed and enriches communities, which is good for society. Maintaining
    and growing these iconic companies is a long-term business, but the people who
    run the business are motivated to play a short-term game.

- en: There are ways to change all of this, as Lazonick outlines in his 2023 book
    “Investing in Innovation.” Companies could decouple executive pay from stock prices
    or change the composition of boards to include employees. But more fundamentally,
    it will take a total rethink of America’s corporate incentive structure. Instead
    of favoring shareholders and playing a quarterly game with Wall Street, C-suites
    should prioritize sustainable, long-term businesses that employ as many productive
    workers as possible. This means companies won’t suddenly fall out of the sky when
    the economy sours or their products start to give way for lack of investment.

  zh: 拉佐尼克在他2023年的书《投资创新》中概述了改变所有这一切的方法。公司可以将高管的薪酬与股价脱钩，或者改变董事会的构成以纳入员工。但更根本的是，这需要彻底重新思考美国的公司激励结构。与其偏袒股东并与华尔街玩季度游戏，高管应该优先考虑可持续的、长期的企业，尽可能多地雇佣生产性工人。这意味着当经济恶化或由于缺乏投资而导致产品过时时，公司不会突然坠落。
- en: In Boeing’s case, that could mean bringing suppliers closer to home, investing
    in more layers of quality control, and allowing more time for testing and research.
    It could mean a more expensive, more redundant company, but a better one. The
    first step is believing that the state of Boeing is not a natural one — that it
    can be changed with conscious effort. We just have to choose a better way.

  zh: 对于波音来说，这可能意味着将供应商带回家，投资更多层次的质量控制，并为测试和研究提供更多时间。这可能会导致一家更昂贵、更多余的公司，但也是一家更好的公司。第一步是相信波音的状况不是自然形成的——我们可以通过有意识的努力改变它。我们只需选择更好的方式。
