    disease significantly reduces complications, including the need for surgery by
    a factor of 10, a clinical study has found. Compared to conventional treatment,
    which favors delaying the use of advanced therapies, the results suggest re-thinking

  zh: 一项临床研究发现，在克罗恩病诊断后尽快给予免疫治疗药物可以显著减少并发症，包括手术需求减少了10倍。与推迟使用高级疗法的传统治疗相比，这些结果表明需要重新思考该病症的治疗方法。
- en: Falling under the umbrella of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), Crohn’s disease
    is a painful and disabling chronic disease characterized by flare-ups that can
    cause progressive bowel damage. The standard treatment for acute flareups is steroids
    to reduce inflammation. Advanced therapy, which includes immunotherapy drugs,
    isn’t usually given until after conventional treatments have failed. Despite treatment
    with the current regime, surgical resection of the bowel is still needed in 17%
    to 25% of patients within five years of diagnosis.

  zh: 克罗恩病属于炎症性肠病（IBD）范畴，是一种痛苦且导致残疾的慢性疾病，其特点是可以引起渐进性肠道损伤的急性发作。急性发作的标准治疗是使用类固醇以减少炎症。通常情况下，高级疗法，包括免疫治疗药物，通常在传统治疗失败后才会给予。尽管接受当前方案治疗，但在诊断后的五年内，仍然有17%至25%的患者需要进行肠道手术切除。
- en: Led by researchers from the University of Cambridge in the UK, a clinical trial
    examined the effectiveness of giving the immunotherapy drug infliximab earlier,
    as soon as possible after diagnosis. They employed what’s called a ‘top-down’
    strategy, meaning the drug was given straight after diagnosis regardless of the
    patient’s symptom severity.

- en: “As soon as a patient is diagnosed with Crohn’s disease, the clock is ticking
    – and has likely been ticking for some time – in terms of damage happening to
    the bowel, so there’s a need to start on advanced therapy such as infliximab as
    soon as possible,” said Nuru Noor, the study’s lead author.

    Noor说道。
- en: Infliximab is a monoclonal antibody that enhances and improves the immune system
    by blocking tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), a protein cells produce during
    acute inflammation. The drug is injected intravenously into the bloodstream or
    under the skin. Although due to historical concerns about infliximab’s cost and
    side effects – including an increased risk of infection due to suppression of
    the immune system – the drug is currently only offered later in the disease’s
    course.

- en: The researchers enrolled 386 patients aged 16 to 80 with active Crohn’s disease
    diagnosed in the previous six months. All patients were given an eight-week course
    of oral steroids, and then randomized into one of two treatment groups and followed
    for a year. The ‘top-down’ group received early infliximab combined with an immune
    system-modulating drug, whereas the ‘accelerated step-up’ group received conventional
    therapy focused on treating flare-ups.

- en: 'The results were striking: at one year, 79% of patients receiving the top-down
    treatment showed sustained steroid- and surgery-free remission, compared to 15%
    in the accelerated step-up group. The top-down group had fewer adverse events,
    including disease flare-ups and serious adverse events, than the accelerated step-up
    group. Ten participants in the accelerated step-up group required urgent abdominal
    surgery for their Crohn’s, versus one participant in the top-down group.'

  zh: 结果惊人：一年后，接受顶端治疗的患者中有79%表现出持续的免疫治疗和手术自由的缓解，而加速逐步组中仅有15%。顶端组的不良事件，包括疾病急性发作和严重不良事件，都比加速逐步组少。加速逐步组中有十名参与者因克罗恩病需要紧急腹部手术，而顶端组中只有一名参与者。
- en: Two-thirds (67%) of top-down patients had no visible ulcers when they underwent
    an endoscopy camera test at the end of the trial. ‘Endoscopic remission’, as it’s
    known, is important as it’s consistently been associated with a decreased risk
    of later Crohn’s disease complications. Most previous clinical trials have considered
    a therapy ‘highly successful’ if 20% to 30% of patients achieved an endoscopic
    remission. To top it off, patients in the top-down group also reported a higher
    quality of life and fewer hospitalizations.

  zh: 在试验结束时，两三分之二（67%）的顶端治疗组患者在进行内窥镜检查时没有可见的溃疡。正如大家所知，“内窥镜缓解”是重要的，因为它一直与之后的克罗恩病并发症的风险减少相关。大多数先前的临床试验认为，如果有20%到30%的患者达到内窥镜缓解，那么该治疗就是“非常成功”的。更值得一提的是，顶端治疗组的患者还报告了更高的生活质量和较少的住院情况。
- en: “Historically, treatment with an advanced therapy like infliximab within two
    years of diagnosis has been considered ‘early’ and an ‘accelerated step-up’ approach
    therefore ‘good enough’,” Noor said. “But our findings redefine what should be
    considered early treatment. We’ve shown that by treating earlier, we can achieve
    better outcomes for patients than have previously been reported.”

  zh: “历史上，诊断后两年内使用英夫利昔单抗等高级治疗被认为是‘早期’，因此‘加速逐步’方法因此‘足够好’，” 诺尔说道。“但我们的研究结果重新定义了什么应该被认为是早期治疗。我们已经证明，通过更早治疗，我们可以实现比以前报告的更好的患者预后。”
- en: Contrary to previous concerns, the researchers found no difference in the risk
    of serious infection between the two treatment groups, suggesting that infliximab
    was safe to give early. Moreover, infliximab is now available as a cheaper generic
    or ‘biosimilar’ drug in both the UK and the US. In Australia, treatment with the
    drug is subsidized through the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS).

  zh: 与先前的担忧相反，研究人员发现两种治疗方法之间没有严重感染风险的差异，这表明英夫利昔单抗早期使用是安全的。此外，在英国和美国，英夫利昔单抗现已作为更便宜的仿制药或生物类似药物上市。在澳大利亚，该药物治疗费用通过药物福利计划（PBS）得到补贴。
- en: “Up until now, the view has been ‘Why would you use a more expensive treatment
    strategy and potentially over-treat people if there’s a chance they might do fine
    anyway?’” said Miles Parkes, corresponding author of the study. “We now know we
    can prevent the majority of adverse outcomes, including [the] need for urgent
    surgery, by providing a treatment strategy that is safe and becoming increasingly

- en: While other anti-TNF drugs, such as adalimumab, work similarly to infliximab
    and are significantly cheaper, more research is needed to establish whether they’re
    clinically effective. The researchers are now analyzing the health economics to
    see whether the benefits of infliximab therapy outweigh its cost.
