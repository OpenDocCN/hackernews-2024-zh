    form of computing, one that took almost until the widespread use of VDTs to mature.
    Look into the computers of the 1960s especially, the early days of interactive
    operation, and you will be amazed at how bizarre and unfriendly the command interface

    telegraphs had limited ranges and even more limited speeds, though, a result mostly
    of the lack of a good way to indicate to the operator whether or not a current

    almost simultaneously worked out that electrical current induced a magnetic field.
    They invented various ways of demonstrating the effect, usually by deflecting
    a magnetic needle. This innovation quickly lead to the "electromagnetic telegraph,"
    in which a telegrapher operates a key to switch current, which causes a needle
    or flag to deflect at the other end of the circuit. This was tremendously simpler
    than previous means of indicating current and was applied almost immediately to
    build the first practical telegraphs. During the 1830s, the invention of the relay
    allowed telegraph signals to be repeated or amplified as the potential weakened

- en: 'From 1830 to 1850, so many people invented so many telegraph systems that it
    is difficult to succinctly describe how an early practical telegraph worked. There
    were certain themes: for non-recording systems, a needle was often deflected one
    way or the other by the presence or absence of current, or perhaps by polarity
    reversal. Sometimes the receiver would strike a bell or sound a buzzer with each
    change. In recording systems, a telegraph printer or telegraph recorder embossed
    a hole or left a small mark on a paper tape that advanced through the device.
    In the first case, the receiving operator would watch the needle, interpreting
    messages as they came. In the second case, the operator could examine the paper

    modern character encodings more than Morse's scheme. In many telegraph applications,

    involved; simple on/off or polarity signals can be amplified using simple mechanical

    of parallel signaling stayed around, though, and was reintroduced during the 1840s
    with a simple form of multiplexing: one "logical channel" for each letter could
    be combined onto one wire using time division muxing, for example by using a transmitter
    and receiver with synchronized spinning wheels. Letters would be presented by
    positions on the wheel, and a pulse sent at the appropriate point in the revolution
    to cause the teleprinter to produce that letter. With this alphabetic teleprinter,

- en: During the era of TWX, encoding schemes changed several times as AT&T and Western
    Union developed better and faster equipment (Western Union continued to make use
    of Western Electric-built Teletype machines among other equipment). ASCII came
    to replace Baudot, and so a number of ASCII teleprinters existed. There were also
    hybrids. For some time Western Union operated teleprinters on an ASCII variant
    that provided only upper case letters and some punctuation, with the benefit of
    requiring fewer bits. The encoding and decoding of this reduced ASCII set was
    implemented by the Bell 101 telephone modem, designed in 1958 to allow SAGE computers
    to communicate with one another and then widely included in TWX and Telex teleprinters.
    The Bell 101's descendants would bring about remote access to time-sharing computer
    systems and, ultimately, one of the major forms of long-distance computer networking.

    written using Baudot tape and standard telegraph equipment. The addition of a
    teleprinter allowed operators to "interactively" enter instructions into the computer
    and read the output, although the concept of a shell (or any other designed user

- en: Business computing is most obviously associated with IBM, a company that had
    large divisions building both computers and typewriters. The marriage of the two
    was inevitable considering the existing precedent. Beginning around 1960 it was
    standard for IBM computers to furnish a teleprinter as the operator interface,
    but IBM had a distinct heritage from the telecommunications industry and, for
    several reasons, was intent on maintaining that distinction. IBM's teleprinter-like
    devices were variously called Data Communications Systems, Printer-Keyboards,
    Consoles, and eventually Terminals. They generally operated over proprietary serial

    and teleprinters were actually rather complex mechanical devices and not all that
    easy to build. As a result, they tended to buy teleprinters from established manufacturers,
    often IBM or Western Electric. Consider the case of a rather famous non-IBM computer,
    the DEC PDP-1 of 1960\. It came with a CRT graphics display as standard, and many
    sources will act as if this was the primary operator interface, but it is important
    to understand that early CRT graphics displays had a hard time with text. Text
    is rather complex to render when you are writing point-by-point to a CRT vector
    display from a rather slow machine. You would be surprised how many vertices a

- en: So despite the ready availability of CRTs in the 1960s (they were, of course,
    well established in the television industry), few computers used them for primary
    text input/output. Instead, the PDP-1 was furnished with a modified IBM typewriter
    as its console. This scheme of paying a third-party company (Soroban Engineering)
    to modify IBM typewriters for teleprinter control was apparently not very practical,
    and later DEC PDP models tended to use Western Electric Teletypes as user terminals.
    These had the considerable advantage that they were already designed to operate
    over long telephone circuits, making it easy to install multiple terminals throughout
    a building for time sharing use.

    computer with many remote terminals. This architecture evolved into the BBS and

    targeted a PDP-11 with teleprinters. While I can't prove it, it seems quite believable
