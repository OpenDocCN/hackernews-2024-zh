    earlier this year that an American Airlines flight attendant, Estes Carter Thompson
    III, was arrested "for allegedly surreptitiously recording or attempting to record
    a minor female passenger using a lavatory aboard an aircraft." A search of Thompson's
    iCloud revealed "four additional instances" where Thompson allegedly recorded
    other minors in the lavatory, as well as "over 50 images of a 9-year-old unaccompanied
    minor" sleeping in her seat. While police attempted to identify these victims,
    they also "further alleged that hundreds of images of AI-generated child pornography"
    were found on Thompson's phone.
