["```\nHello!\n\nAs you probably know, F5 closed Moscow office in 2022, and I no\nlonger work for F5 since then.  Still, we’ve reached an agreement\nthat I will maintain my role in nginx development as a volunteer.\nAnd for almost two years I was working on improving nginx and\nmaking it better for everyone, for free.\n\nUnfortunately, some new non-technical management at F5 recently\ndecided that they know better how to run open source projects.  In\nparticular, they decided to interfere with security policy nginx\nuses for years, ignoring both the policy and developers’ position.\n\nThat’s quite understandable: they own the project, and can do\nanything with it, including doing marketing-motivated actions,\nignoring developers position and community.  Still, this\ncontradicts our agreement.  And, more importantly, I no longer able\nto control which changes are made in nginx within F5, and no longer\nsee nginx as a free and open source project developed and\nmaintained for the public good.\n\nAs such, starting from today, I will no longer participate in nginx\ndevelopment as run by F5\\.  Instead, I’m starting an alternative\nproject, which is going to be run by developers, and not corporate\nentities:\n\nhttp://freenginx.org/\n\nThe goal is to keep nginx development free from arbitrary corporate\nactions.  Help and contributions are welcome.  Hope it will be\nbeneficial for everyone.\n\n-- \nMaxim Dounin\nhttp://freenginx.org/\n\n```"]
