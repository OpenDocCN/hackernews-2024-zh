    to [block union organizing](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/16/technology/amazon-unions-virginia.html)
    in its fulfillment centers. But this time, these companies aren’t just limiting
    the rights of their own workers. If these threats against the NLRB keep moving
    forward, American workers could lose workplace protections that they’ve had for
    almost a century.

    但这一次，这些公司不仅仅是限制他们自己工人的权利。 如果这些对NLRB的威胁继续前进，美国工人可能会失去他们近一个世纪以来的工作场所保护。

- en: Amazon claims that the NLRB’s structure is unconstitutional because administrative
    law judges are “insulated from presidential oversight,” thus violating the separation
    of powers. The company also argues against the structure of NLRB itself, as well
    as its ability to fine a company for unfair labor practices after a hearing, rather
    than a full jury trial.

  zh: 亚马逊声称NLRB的结构违宪，因为行政法官“与总统监督隔离”，从而违反了三权分立。 该公司还反对NLRB本身的结构，以及在听证会后对公司进行不公平劳动行为罚款的能力，而不是进行完整的陪审团审判。

- en: “Judges need protections to remain independent, just like federal judges. You
    can’t remove federal judges,” Goldstein told TechCrunch. The complaint about a
    lack of jury trials for companies may seem less dubious, but Goldstein still thinks
    it’s a stretch. “At the end of the day, the courts do have jurisdiction over decisions
    by the board. So what are they complaining about?”

  zh: “法官需要保护以保持独立，就像联邦法官一样。 你不能撤换联邦法官，” Goldstein告诉TechCrunch。 对于公司缺少陪审团审判的投诉可能看起来不那么可疑，但Goldstein仍然认为这是一个伸张。“归根结底，法院确实对委员会的决定具有管辖权。
    他们在抱怨什么？”
- en: Like other federal agencies, the NLRB is largely shaped by the current president.
    Under President Joe Biden, who [refers to himself](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/09/01/fact-sheet-ahead-of-labor-day-biden-harris-administration-announces-new-actions-to-empower-workers-building-on-the-presidents-historic-support-for-workers-and-unions/)
    as pro-worker, the NLRB has been [friendly](https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/nlrb-paves-way-workers-unionize-without-formal-elections-2023-08-25/)
    toward workers’ causes. But as the 2024 election looms, a Republican administration
    could significantly change that, making it more likely for corporations to be
    successful in attempts to strike down long-standing labor law.

  zh: 与其他联邦机构一样，NLRB在很大程度上受到现任总统的影响。在自称为亲工人的乔·拜登总统领导下，NLRB对工人事业友好。但随着2024年选举的临近，共和党政府可能会显著改变这一局面，从而更有可能使企业成功地试图废除长期存在的劳工法。
