    *"When Andreas Vesalius (1514–1564) first published his radical De humani corporis
    fabrica (On the Structure of the Human Body), the ancient texts of Aristotle and
    Galen were still judged authoritative in the medical schools of Europe. By performing
    his own dissections, Vesalius discovered errors in the ancient authors'' teachings.
    The De humani corporis fabrica, which drew attention to these flaws, initially
    threatened the academic medical establishment but ultimately won Vesalius admiration
    and a post as court physician to Charles V, to whom he dedicated the volume."*'

    point he burned all his notes and dropped out of Academia entirely. One of Vesalius
