    contacting workers after hours, with penalties including jail time for bosses

  zh: 上周，澳大利亚通过了一项“断开连接权”法律，禁止雇主在下班后联系工人，对违规行为的老板的惩罚包括监禁。
- en: The criminal sanction will soon be overturned – it was the result of parliamentary
    shenanigans rather than the government's intent – and the whole law could go too
    if opposition parties and business groups have their way.

  zh: 刑事制裁很快就会被撤销——这是由于议会的把戏而不是政府的意图——如果反对党和商业团体愿意的话，整个法律也可能会被废除。
- en: European companies have already [introduced](https://www.theregister.com/2021/06/30/feature_always_on_culture_notifications/)
    Right To Disconnect laws in response to digital devices blurring the boundaries
    between working hours and personal time. The laptops or phones employers provide
    have obvious after-hours uses, but also mean workers can find themselves browsing
    emailed or texted messages from their boss at all hours – sometimes with an expectation
    of a response. That expectation, labor rights orgs argue, extends the working
    day without increasing pay.

  zh: 欧洲公司已经根据数字设备模糊了工作时间和个人时间之间的界限，[引入](https://www.theregister.com/2021/06/30/feature_always_on_culture_notifications/)了“断开连接权”法律。雇主提供的笔记本电脑或手机明显在下班后有用，但也意味着工人可能会发现自己在任何时候都在浏览老板发送的电子邮件或短信消息，有时还会期望得到回复。劳工权利组织认为，这种期望延长了工作日而没有增加工资。
- en: Right To Disconnect laws might better be termed "Right to not read or respond
    to messages from work" laws because that's what they seek to guarantee.

    "that the employer stops unreasonable out of hours contact."

  zh: 律师事务所 Holding Redlich 对澳大利亚法律的[看法](https://www.holdingredlich.com/closing-loopholes-2023-recap-2024-outlook)是，它将给予雇员寻求“要求雇主停止不合理的下班后联系”的机会。

  zh: 澳大利亚工商理事会批评了这项法律，理由是它——尤其是其刑事制裁——在通过之前并没有进行长时间的辩论。

    operators of digital platforms – Australian legal-speak for gig-work platforms
