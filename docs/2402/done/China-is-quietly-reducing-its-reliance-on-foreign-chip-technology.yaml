- en: From consumer gadgets to cars, China has shown a knack for producing cutting-edge
    technology. Yet [the semiconductors](https://www.economist.com/the-world-ahead/2023/11/13/semiconductors-will-remain-central-to-americas-tech-rivalry-with-china)
    that power the digital economy have proved trickier to master. That has been the
    source of much anxiety among its political and business elites in recent years.
    America’s decision in 2022 to [halt exports](https://www.economist.com/business/2022/10/13/america-curbs-chinese-access-to-advanced-computing)
    to the country of its whizziest chips and chipmaking tools brought into stark
    relief [the chokehold of China’s geopolitical rivals](https://www.economist.com/business/2024/01/21/why-americas-controls-on-sales-of-ai-tech-to-china-are-so-leaky)
    over the industry. In December last year China’s imports of the lithography machines
    used to imprint circuits onto silicon wafers surged by 450%, year on year, as
    local chipmakers raced to buy advanced kit from ASML, the Dutch market leader,
    before export restrictions by the Netherlands came into effect in January. It
    has also been hoovering up semiconductor equipment from Japan (see next article).

  zh: 从消费电子产品到汽车，中国展现出了生产尖端技术的本领。然而，[推动数字经济的半导体](https://www.economist.com/the-world-ahead/2023/11/13/semiconductors-will-remain-central-to-americas-tech-rivalry-with-china)却被证明更难掌握。近年来，这一点引起了政治和商业精英的许多焦虑。2022年美国决定[停止出口](https://www.economist.com/business/2022/10/13/america-curbs-chinese-access-to-advanced-computing)其最尖端的芯片和芯片制造工具到中国，使中国的地缘政治对手对该行业的控制力一览无余。去年12月，随着中国本土芯片制造商争相购买荷兰市场领导者ASML的先进设备，用于在硅晶圆上印制电路的光刻机的进口额同比激增了450%，荷兰的出口限制在1月份生效之前。它还从日本收购了半导体设备（见下一篇文章）。
- en: Although the Chinese government has been splashing subsidies on its domestic
    chip industry for many years, mounting concern over the trade restrictions being
    imposed by America and its allies have led it to double down on the effort. In
    2022 China’s government ramped up a national drive often referred to as the “Information
    Innovation” project, or *xinchuang*, that aims to replace foreign suppliers of,
    among other things, semiconductor technology. What’s more, whereas the state once
    pushed reluctant chipmakers to co-operate with local suppliers, their investors
    and boards now demand it as a form of insurance against trade wars. As a result,
    China’s semiconductor supply chain is steadily deepening. But can it ever match
    that of its rivals?

  zh: 尽管中国政府多年来一直在国内芯片产业上大肆补贴，但对美国及其盟国实施的贸易限制引起了越来越多的关注，导致中国加倍努力。2022年，中国政府加大了一项被称为“信息创新”项目或*xinchuang*的全国性推动力度，旨在替换外国供应商的半导体技术等内容。此外，虽然过去政府曾强迫不情愿的芯片制造商与本地供应商合作，但如今他们的投资者和董事会却要求此举作为对贸易战的保险。因此，中国的半导体供应链正在稳步加深。但它能否与竞争对手的相匹敌呢？
