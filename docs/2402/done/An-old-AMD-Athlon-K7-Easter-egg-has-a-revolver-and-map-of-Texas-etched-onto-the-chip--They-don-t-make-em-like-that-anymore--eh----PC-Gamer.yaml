- en: When [AMD's Athlon K7 CPU](https://www.pcgamer.com/a-brief-history-of-cpus-31-awesome-years-of-x86/4/)
    was launched way back in 1999, it turned out to be something of an Intel-killer,
    smashing the heavyweight's Pentium III CPU. Now it turns out those K7 chips were
    actual gun slingers, at least insofar as they had bullet-blasting guns etched
    right into their silicon dies.

  zh: 当[AMD的Athlon K7 CPU](https://www.pcgamer.com/a-brief-history-of-cpus-31-awesome-years-of-x86/4/)于1999年推出时，它被证明是英特尔的一种竞争者，击败了英特尔的奔腾III
    CPU。现在看来，那些K7芯片实际上是枪手，至少在它们的硅芯片上刻有射击子弹的枪。
- en: That's the discovery made by X poster Fritzchens Fritz, who has something of
    a sideline in gorgeous photography of CPU and GPU dies. If you zoom into one corner
    of the top metal layer you can apparently see a revolver firing a bullet, right
    next to a map of Texas.

  zh: 这是由X用户Fritzchens Fritz发现的，他在CPU和GPU芯片的华丽摄影方面有一些副业。如果你放大顶层金属层的一个角落，你可以看到一个左轮手枪发射子弹，就在德克萨斯州地图旁边。
- en: The Texas bit may well be a reference to AMD's facilities in Austin Texas. The
    gun and speeding bullet? Well, that's anyone's guess.

  zh: 德克萨斯州部分很可能是对AMD位于德克萨斯州奥斯汀市的设施的参考。枪和高速子弹呢？嗯，那是任何人的猜测。
- en: Whatever, it was the Athlon K7 that arguably first shot AMD onto an equal footing
    with Intel for performance. Not only did it launch with the same 600MHz peak clockspeeds
    as the Pentium III of the day, it actually offered superior performance in some
    benchmarks. And that's including the applications that majored on floating point
    performance, which were previously the preserve of Intel's finest CPUs.

  zh: 不管怎样，可以说是Athlon K7首先使AMD在性能上与英特尔平起平坐。它不仅以与当时奔腾III相同的600MHz峰值时钟速度发布，而且在一些基准测试中实际上提供了更好的性能。这还包括主攻浮点性能的应用程序，这些应用程序以前是英特尔最好的CPU的专利。
- en: As it happens, it's not a huge surprise to learn that none other than Jim Keller,
    widely regarded as one of the leading chip architects of recent decades and [the
    man behind AMD's current series of Zen CPU architectures](https://www.pcgamer.com/amds-zen-5-cpu-is-scary-fast-according-to-performance-numbers-from-the-actual-father-of-zen/),
    had a hand in K7's design. Anyway, long story short, K7 proved to be faster than
    Pentium III in Quake III, and that's really all that matters, right?

  zh: 恰巧，得知著名芯片架构师吉姆·凯勒（Jim Keller）参与了K7的设计并不是什么大新闻，他被广泛认为是近几十年来领先的芯片架构师之一，是[AMD当前系列Zen
    CPU架构背后的人](https://www.pcgamer.com/amds-zen-5-cpu-is-scary-fast-according-to-performance-numbers-from-the-actual-father-of-zen/)。长话短说，K7在《雷神之锤III》中的速度超过了奔腾III，这才是最重要的事情，对吧？

    review](https://www.anandtech.com/show/355/17) with the Athlon K7 clocking up
    just under 120fps while the Pentium III lumbers along below 100fps. Ouch!

  zh: 有趣的是，你可以查看[Anandtech的原始评测](https://www.anandtech.com/show/355/17)中的《雷神之锤III》基准测试数据，其中Athlon
    K7的帧率略低于120fps，而奔腾III的帧率则低于100fps。哎呀！
- en: Just to provide some context and an idea of how far we've come since the K7,
    it was built on a 0.25 micron process, which essentially means 250nm, and contained
    22 million transistors.

  zh: 为了提供一些背景和对我们自K7以来走过的路程的了解，它是建立在0.25微米工艺上的，这基本上意味着250纳米，并且包含了2200万个晶体管。

- en: The latter was actually the highest to date at the time, further underlining
    that K7 wasn't just there to snag some low-end budget PC sales but was intended
    to make AMD a real contender for premium performance for the first time.

  zh: 后者实际上是当时迄今为止最高的，进一步说明K7不仅仅是为了争取一些低端预算PC销售，而是打算首次使AMD成为真正的优秀性能竞争者。
- en: Today, AMD produces CPUs on 5nm and 4nm TSMC nodes and its Phoenix APU contains
    25 billion transistors. AMD also overtook Intel when it comes to market cap, or
    the overall value of a company according to its share price, in June 2022.

  zh: 如今，AMD在5纳米和4纳米的TSMC节点上生产CPU，其Phoenix APU包含250亿个晶体管。2022年6月，AMD的市值超过英特尔，即公司的整体价值根据其股价确定。
- en: Today, AMD is worth about $270 billion to Intel's $180 billion, an eventuality
    that would have been very, very hard to believe back in 1999, especially when
    you consider that Intel had a similar market cap in 1999 to that which is has
    today but AMD was only worth a couple of billion.

  zh: 如今，AMD的价值约为2700亿美元，而英特尔的价值为1800亿美元，这一情况在1999年几乎难以置信，尤其是考虑到英特尔在1999年的市值与今天的市值相似，但AMD当时只值几十亿美元。
