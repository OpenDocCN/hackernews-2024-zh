["```\n Date: Sun, 22 Mar 87 10:56:56 EST\n   From: rms (Richard M. Stallman)\n\n   The GNU C compiler is now available for ftp from the file\n   /u2/emacs/gcc.tar on prep.ai.mit.edu.  This includes machine\n   descriptions for vax and sun, 60 pages of documentation on writing\n   machine descriptions (internals.texinfo, internals.dvi and Info\n   file internals).\n\n   This also contains the ANSI standard (Nov 86) C preprocessor and 30\n   pages of reference manual for it.\n\n   This compiler compiles itself correctly on the 68020 and did so\n   recently on the vax.  It recently compiled Emacs correctly on the\n   68020, and has also compiled tex-in-C and Kyoto Common Lisp.\n   However, it probably still has numerous bugs that I hope you will\n   find for me.\n\n   I will be away for a month, so bugs reported now will not be\n   handled until then.\n\n   If you can't ftp, you can order a compiler beta-test tape from the\n   Free Software Foundation for $150 (plus 5% sales tax in\n   Massachusetts, or plus $15 overseas if you want air mail).\n\n   Free Software Foundation\n   1000 Mass Ave\n   Cambridge, MA  02138\n```"]
