    amounts of attention, in real life and subsequently online, by simply wearing
    it in public.

  zh: 对于一些购买者来说，Apple Vision Pro 最吸引人的用途是苹果没有宣传的。这是该设备的一个本地特性，使用户能够通过简单地在公共场合佩戴它来获得大量的关注，无论是现实生活中还是随后在网络上。

    for producing a viral video than wearing your new Vision Pro while at a restaurant,
    strutting down city streets, on the subway, or driving your Tesla. Many of these
    videos were clearly [staged or fake](https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/6/24063317/vision-pro-viral-videos-tesla-cybertruck-autopilot),

    without being acutely aware of your performance, at least for now.

- en: These videos meet a clear demand for evidence that Apple’s face computer is
    as ridiculous as it first looks, while simultaneously making the case for its
    inevitability. They’re funny! They’re also functionally a form of marketing, and
    not especially illuminating about how people might use mixed reality devices in
    the future, or for that matter how they’re using one now. Influencers with monetization

  zh: 与公共病毒传播戏剧性的对比，Vision Pro 的用户账户比令人讨厌的更引人深思。从头盔内发布的每一条兴奋或困惑的观察都暗示着一系列轻微荒谬的小插曲，无人观察：一个用户坐在床边数小时，在空气中捏着手指；一个人坐在桌前，嘴唇没碰到杯沿就将其砰地撞到了头盔上；一个家伙“拿着”一个视频放在他的脸前，像一个看不见的平板电脑一样，[这样他就能继续观看](https://www.reddit.com/r/VisionPro/comments/1ahoamu/has_anyone_figured_out_how_to_keep_an_app_in_view/)，同时在厨房里走来走去；一个用户发现了，[他相信](https://www.reddit.com/r/VisionPro/comments/1aj0yqx/comfortable_lying_down/)，使用苹果新的混合现实计算平台的最佳方式，是趴在床上，灯光开着：

    for me. Only time I sit up are when there’s a need to (watching stuff in immersive

    Is the Vision Pro for watching movies? Working? Being alone? Collaborating? Nobody
    knows, really. Rather than settling into a new routine, or building a workflow

    about what this thing might do once there are more apps, or once it’s [smaller
    and lighter and better](https://www.reddit.com/r/VisionPro/comments/1akafbg/curious_what_peoples_thoughts_are_on_the_possible/),

- en: 'For Apple, a massive public company that is taking a sizeable risk on a new
    product category, this perhaps isn’t the *ideal* response. It calls to mind to
    the era of consumer technology just before the iPhone came out, when various manufacturers
    were still figuring out what to do with nascent touchscreen technology, slow but
    functional mobile internet connections, shrinking hard drives and processors;
    like Taco Bell rearranges the same dozen ingredients into new menu items every
    few years, consumer tech companies were releasing seemingly randomized permutations
    of Things With Batteries And Screens, assuming that at some point one of them
    would stick. The way people are talking about the Vision Pro now is a lot like

    mostly interesting as *gadgets* — as tools, sure, but mostly as objects of fascination

    Taco Bell 每隔几年将相同的十几种原料重新组合成新的菜单项一样，消费技术公司当时发布了看似随机的各种电池和屏幕相关的事物，假设其中某一个最终会成功。现在人们对
