- en: Yes, it's kind of spooky, this one, isn't it? It just happened to me on my Ultra
    2, and it's easy to believe that it's somebody else trying to manipulate your
    watch, because it's a lot of random screen presses and swipes (which is, of course,
    the main way of interacting with the watch).

  zh: 是的，这种情况确实有点吓人，不是吗？这刚刚发生在我的 Ultra 2 上，很容易相信是其他人在试图操控你的手表，因为这是大量随机的屏幕点击和滑动（这当然是与手表互动的主要方式）。
- en: What actually gets triggered will depend on things like which complications
    you have on the display. For mine, it kept starting lots of timers, which then
    of course started buzzing and flashing as they went off...

  zh: 真正触发的事情将取决于你的显示器上有哪些复杂的设置。对于我来说，它一直在启动大量的计时器，然后当它们响起时，当然会发出嗡嗡声和闪烁⋯⋯
- en: And if, like me, you take your watch off to try other solutions, then of course,
    the random screen taps will quickly result in a keypad asking you to enter your
    PIN, and you'll see what looks like somebody trying lots and lots of attempts
    to hack into your watch...

  zh: 而且，如果像我一样，你把手表脱下来尝试其他解决方案，那么当然，随机的屏幕点击会很快导致一个键盘弹出，要求你输入 PIN 码，你会看到像是有人试图大量尝试入侵你的手表⋯⋯
- en: I haven't ever seen something like that on an Apple product before, so it was
    pretty wild!

  zh: 在 Apple 产品上我以前从未见过这样的情况，所以这真的很疯狂！
- en: But I noted the earlier comment that a recent software update supposedly contains
    a fix for this, and by resetting a few times and putting the watch on its charger,
    I managed to get it to recover to the point where I could do the software update.
    So far, it now seems fine. We shall see... :-)

  zh: 但我注意到早先的评论说最近的软件更新据说包含了修复此问题的内容，通过多次重置并将手表放在充电器上，我设法让它恢复到可以进行软件更新的状态。到目前为止，看起来一切都正常。我们拭目以待...
    :-)
