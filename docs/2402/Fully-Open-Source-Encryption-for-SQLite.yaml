- en: SQLite is a database trusted by many, but it has a closed community that is
    not open to contributions. Because of that, despite SQLite’s incredible versatility,
    improvements that are important outside the central use cases SQLite tend not
    to get done, even though there are people willing to do them.

    the [libSQL](https://turso.tech/libsql) project, an Open Contribution fork of
    SQLite. Our mission at Turso is to empower users to use SQLite in production to
    power their applications. So after features like native replication, automatic
    backups to S3 and a serverless mode, we are adding to libSQL yet another feature
    that is critical to production workloads: **encryption at rest**.'

    SQLite have to replace their usage of SQLite with our SDK. In the example below,
    using Typescript, the client is created by passing a URL, which in this case is
    a file in the local filesystem.

    would be better served by a general purpose fork of SQLite that was open to anybody.
    Forks of SQLite for special purpose operations exist in the open and are nothing
    new, but due to their narrow nature, they see less distribution than they deserve.

- en: Encryption is not an exception. In fact, many forks exist that add encryption
    to SQLite. After some research, code analysis and careful consideration, we decided
    that just moving the code to our fork would yield better results than writing
    a whole new batch of encryption code, or requiring users to load extensions. One
    project in particular was very suitable for us, [SQLite Multiple Ciphers](https://utelle.github.io/SQLite3MultipleCiphers/).
    Since it is licensed under MIT, we have just moved the code into libSQL.

    of encryption, and to provide the transparent, out-of-the-box experience we have
