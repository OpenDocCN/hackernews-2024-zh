    I had received from my grandfather, an inheritance he took great pains to set
    up for his grandchildren before his death. Sometimes I imagine how I would have
    spent it if I had to get rid of it in a day. I could have paid for over a year’s
    worth of child care up front. I could have put it toward the master’s degree I’ve
    always wanted. I could have housed multiple families for months. Perhaps, inadvertently,
    I am; I occasionally wonder what the scammers did with it.

  zh: $50,000 是一大笔钱。我花了多年的时间储蓄，每次完成大项目后都会存一些。其中一部分是我从祖父那里得到的钱，他在去世前为他的孙辈们精心布置的遗产。有时我想象，如果我必须在一天之内花掉它，我会怎么使用它。我可以提前支付一年以上的儿童护理费用。我可以用它来攻读我一直想要的硕士学位。我可以让多个家庭住上几个月。也许无意中，我正在这样做；我偶尔想知道骗子用它做了什么。
- en: Because I had set it aside for emergencies and taxes, it was money I tried to
    pretend I didn’t have — it wasn’t for spending. Initially, I was afraid that I
    wouldn’t be able to afford my taxes this year, but then my accountant told me
    I could write off losses due to theft. So from a financial standpoint, I’ll survive,
    as long as I don’t have another emergency — a real one — anytime soon.

  zh: 因为我把它留作紧急情况和税金，这笔钱我曾试图假装我没有——它不是用来花的。最初，我担心今年支付不起税款，但后来我的会计告诉我，我可以因为被盗而减税。所以从财务角度来看，我会挺过去，只要不出现另一个紧急情况——一个真正的紧急情况——就好了。
- en: When I did tell friends what had happened, it seemed like everyone had a horror
    story. One friend’s dad, a criminal-defense attorney, had been scammed out of
    $1.2 million. Another person I know, a real-estate developer, was duped into wiring
    $450,000 to someone posing as one of his contractors. Someone else knew a Wall
    Street executive who had been conned into draining her 401(k) by some guy she
    met at a bar.

  zh: 当我告诉朋友发生了什么事时，似乎每个人都有恐怖故事。一个朋友的父亲，一位刑事辩护律师，被骗走了120万美元。我认识的另一个人，一位房地产开发商，被骗转账45万美元给一个冒充他的承包商的人。还有人认识一个华尔街高管，被一个在酒吧里认识的家伙骗得清空了她的401(k)退休计划账户。
- en: I felt a guilty sense of consolation whenever I heard about a scam involving
    someone I respected. If this could happen to them, maybe I wasn’t such a moron.
    As a journalist, it’s my instinct to research and talk to experts, so I dove into
    books and podcasts about scams, desperate to make sense of my own. I had known
    that fraud was on the rise but was shocked to learn the numbers — financial losses
    ballooned by more than 30 percent in 2022\. I read that self-laceration is typical;
    half of victims blame themselves for being gullible, and most experience serious
    anxiety, depression, or other stress-related health problems afterward. I heard
    about victim support groups. I went to therapy.

  zh: 当我听说涉及我尊敬的人的骗局时，我感到一种内疚的慰藉。如果这种事情发生在他们身上，也许我并不是个白痴。作为一名记者，我本能地进行研究并与专家交流，所以我深入研究了关于骗局的书籍和播客，迫切地希望理解自己的情况。我知道欺诈案件在增加，但惊讶地得知数额
    —— 2022年的财务损失增长了30%以上。我了解到自责是典型的反应；一半的受害者责备自己太轻信，并且大多数人在之后经历严重的焦虑、抑郁或其他与压力相关的健康问题。我听说了受害者支持团体。我去了心理治疗。

    the popular *Money With Katie* newsletter, lost $8,000 five years ago to a grandmotherly-sounding
    woman pretending to call from Tassin’s credit union, I called her to ask how she’d
    coped. “Everyone was so patronizing,” she told me. “The response was basically
    ‘It’s your fault that this happened.’”

    it was probably when they read me my Social Security number. Now I know that all
    kinds of personal information — your email address, your kids’ names and birthdays,
    even your pets’ names — are commonly sold on the dark web. Of course, the scammers
    could also have learned about my son from a 30-second perusal of my Instagram
    feed.

- en: It was my brother, the lawyer, who pointed out that what I had experienced sounded
    a lot like a coerced confession. “I read enough transcripts of bad interrogations
    in law school to understand that anyone can be convinced that they have a very
    narrow set of terrible options,” he said. When I posed this theory to Saul Kassin,
    a psychology professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice who studies coerced
    confessions, he agreed. “If someone is trying to get you to be compliant, they
    do it incrementally, in a series of small steps that take you farther and farther
    from what you know to be true,” he said. “It’s not about breaking the will. They
    were altering the sense of reality.” And when you haven’t done anything wrong,
    the risk of cooperating feels minimal, he added. An innocent person thinks everything
    will get sorted out. It also mattered that I was kept on the phone for so long.
    People start to break down cognitively after a few hours of interrogation. “At
    that point, they’re not thinking straight. They feel the need to put an end to
    the situation at all costs,” Kassin said.

  zh: 我的哥哥，一位律师，指出我经历的事情听起来很像被逼供。“我在法学院读了足够多的不良审讯记录，以理解任何人都可能被说服认为他们只有一种非常糟糕的选择，”他说。当我将这个理论提给约翰杰伊刑事司法学院心理学教授索尔·卡辛时，他表示同意。“如果有人试图让你顺从，他们会逐步进行，一系列小步骤将你带得越来越远，远离你所知道的真相，”他说。“这不是要打破意志。他们是在改变现实感。”他补充道，当你没有做错任何事时，合作的风险看起来微不足道。一个无辜的人认为一切将会得到澄清。长时间被人耗费在电话中也很重要。人们在几个小时的审讯后开始认知崩溃。“在那一点上，他们不再思考清晰。他们感到有必要不惜一切代价结束这种情况，”卡辛说。

    up a box.

    that if the scammers hadn’t mentioned my son, I would never have fallen for this.
    They’re right that I’d be willing to do — or pay — anything to protect him. Either
    way, I have to accept that someone waged psychological warfare on me, and I lost.
