    delivers the distances from A and B to C. Triangulation was attractive because
    it replaced expensive measurement of distances with cheap measurement of angles.
    After the mathematician Gemma Frisius explained how triangulation could be used
    for mapmaking in 1533, the method spread rapidly across Europe. In 1578, the astronomer
    Tycho Brahe [used triangulation to map the island of Hven](https://ncgeo.nl/downloads/14Haasbroek.pdf)

    Frisius）解释了三角测量如何用于制图，该方法迅速在欧洲传播开来。1578年，天文学家第谷·布拉赫（Tycho Brahe）[利用三角测量绘制了其位于的赫文岛](https://ncgeo.nl/downloads/14Haasbroek.pdf)，并在本世纪末的许多教科书中描述了这种方法。

    networks, where triangulated points are used for further triangulation (see diagram
    below). With sufficiently exact angular measurements, there is no limit to the
    precision and range of such networks. In 1615, the Dutch mathematician [Willebrod
    Snellius used a triangulation network based on church spires to determine the
    distances](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willebrord_Snellius#Triangulation) between
    14 Dutch cities, and by the mid-eighteenth century, the [French geodesic missions](https://www.nature.com/articles/476149a)
    (attempts to measure the shape of the Earth) used triangulation networks and precise
    instruments to establish that the Earth bulges at the equator by showing that
    one degree of latitude is 111.9 kilometers at the Arctic circle, but only 110.5
    kilometers at the equator. Triangulation networks formed the basis of mapmaking

    the geometry of fortification grew more complex through the introduction of the
    star fort, the so-called *trace italienne*. Star forts were intricately shaped
    low-lying fortresses surrounded by a protective belt of glacis (sloping banks)
    and ravelins (outward-poking triangles of wall) that prevented direct cannon fire
    onto the walls. Their triangular bastions deflected cannon shots while allowing
    defenders to enfilade (fire along a line end to end) attackers seeking to scale
    the walls. To construct them, [fortress building emerged as an area of applied
    mathematics](https://www.jstor.org/stable/3101334), since getting the geometry

    determine the distance to celestial bodies. The key idea was that whether you

    is around the Earth’s *center*, not its *surface*, where observers are located.
    Given this, it turns out that proximate objects appear to move faster across the
    heavens than distant objects. The diagram below shows how an observer on the edge
    of a spinning body perceives proximate and distant objects: as the observer spins,
    the proximate red point appears to move past the distant black point. Tycho Brahe
    famously used this reasoning to argue that the 1572 supernova and the 1577 comet
    must be located far beyond the moon because they appeared to move much less than
    the moon relative to distant stars. This was important for astronomical debates,challenging
    the Aristotelian view that only the sublunary sphere saw change while the heavens

    dates and times. If sailors knew how high different celestial objects were above
    the horizon at different latitudes and different dates of the year, they could
    find the latitude by measuring their angles and consulting the relevant date in
    the almanac. This facilitated [open sea navigation](https://press.uchicago.edu/books/HOC/HOC_V3_Pt1/HOC_VOLUME3_Part1_chapter20.pdf),
    as sailors with knowledge of the latitude of their destination could sail north
    or south until the position in the sky of the Sun or some other celestial object
    indicated that they had reached the desired latitude, and then sail along it.
    This released them from having to follow the coast. The importance of having the
    right latitude was amply demonstrated in [1707](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scilly_naval_disaster_of_1707)
    when more than 1,400 British sailors drowned after four British warships crashed

    and in the Protestant educational program designed by Philip Melanchthon –himself
    a student of the mathematician and astronomer [Johannes Stöffler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johannes_St%C3%B6ffler)

    The Frenchman [Petrus Ramus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petrus_Ramus) created
    a program in the mid-sixteenth century aimed at expanding and enhancing education.
    Although Ramus was not a mathematician, he believed strongly in the value of the
    practical skills provided by mathematics and it was central to his educational
    ideas. His program, known as [Ramism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramism), gained
    short-term but substantial influence in schools in Germany, the Netherlands, England,
    Scotland, Sweden, and, to a certain extent, France. Although the impact of his
    ideas diminished in the seventeenth century, they remained relevant among the
    religious dissenters who won the English Civil War and colonized New England.

    was to govern Jesuit education for the next two centuries, mathematics is only
    mentioned in a few paragraphs across a 100-page document, and its study was relegated
    to the last year of a seven-year program. Jesuit schools still produced elite
    mathematicians like René Descartes, but by placing mathematics at the end of a
    long classical curriculum, they discouraged the widespread dissemination of the
    practical arithmetic skills favored by the earlier Abacus schools and by the Ramist

    speed, requirements for precision grew ever more stringent. In the 1770s, James

    of Locks*](https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/63128/pg63128-images.html#Page82).

    the fact that even a small number of objects can be ordered in an extraordinary
    number of ways. Bramah notes that even if a lock only has 12 moving parts with
    12 distinct positions, ‘the ultimate number of changes that may be made in their
    place or situation is 479,001,600; and by adding one more to that number of slides,
    they would then be capable of receiving a number of changes equal to 6,227,020,800;
