    these theories to the world also advanced dramatically. One striking example comes
    from angular measurement, which saw large increases in precision as astronomers
    began to use new instruments, like the mural quadrant in the picture above. Angular
    measurement works by pointing instruments toward objects and reading off their
    angles on a measurement scale. The precision of pointing was improved by telescopic
    sights and finely tunable mechanisms, while better-designed measurement scales
    allowed astronomers to discriminate between similar angles. The graph below shows
    the trend of precision, going from seven arcminutes, or 0.11 degrees, in 1550,
    to 0.06 arc*seconds*, or 0.000017 degrees, in 1850 – an astounding improvement
    of almost 7,000 times over three centuries.

    of triangulation. The diagram below illustrates the basic idea: if you have the

    position of C. Further, if the length between A and B is known, the method also
    delivers the distances from A and B to C. Triangulation was attractive because
    it replaced expensive measurement of distances with cheap measurement of angles.
    After the mathematician Gemma Frisius explained how triangulation could be used
    for mapmaking in 1533, the method spread rapidly across Europe. In 1578, the astronomer
    Tycho Brahe [used triangulation to map the island of Hven](https://ncgeo.nl/downloads/14Haasbroek.pdf)

    Snellius used a triangulation network based on church spires to determine the
    distances](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willebrord_Snellius#Triangulation) between
    14 Dutch cities, and by the mid-eighteenth century, the [French geodesic missions](https://www.nature.com/articles/476149a)
    (attempts to measure the shape of the Earth) used triangulation networks and precise
    instruments to establish that the Earth bulges at the equator by showing that
    one degree of latitude is 111.9 kilometers at the Arctic circle, but only 110.5
    kilometers at the equator. Triangulation networks formed the basis of mapmaking

    the geometry of fortification grew more complex through the introduction of the
    star fort, the so-called *trace italienne*. Star forts were intricately shaped
    low-lying fortresses surrounded by a protective belt of glacis (sloping banks)
    and ravelins (outward-poking triangles of wall) that prevented direct cannon fire
    onto the walls. Their triangular bastions deflected cannon shots while allowing
    defenders to enfilade (fire along a line end to end) attackers seeking to scale
    the walls. To construct them, [fortress building emerged as an area of applied
    mathematics](https://www.jstor.org/stable/3101334), since getting the geometry
    right was crucial to combine protection from enemy cannon fire with a good line
    of sight for defenders.

    for why the 45-degree angle maximizes a cannon’s range, and offers guidance on
    instruments that gunners could use to measure distances and calibrate cannon elevations.

    determine the distance to celestial bodies. The key idea was that whether you
    believe the Earth spins around its axis or the heavens around the Earth, the spinning
    is around the Earth’s *center*, not its *surface*, where observers are located.
    Given this, it turns out that proximate objects appear to move faster across the
    heavens than distant objects. The diagram below shows how an observer on the edge
    of a spinning body perceives proximate and distant objects: as the observer spins,
    the proximate red point appears to move past the distant black point. Tycho Brahe
    famously used this reasoning to argue that the 1572 supernova and the 1577 comet
    must be located far beyond the moon because they appeared to move much less than
    the moon relative to distant stars. This was important for astronomical debates,challenging
    the Aristotelian view that only the sublunary sphere saw change while the heavens
    were unchanging.'

    Galileo improved the magnification of the recently invented telescope and used
    it to discover that Venus had phases just like the moon. According to the Ptolemaic
    model, Venus is always located between the Earth and the Sun, and there could
    never be a ‘full Venus’, since this could only occur if Venus was located beyond
    the Sun from the perspective of the Earth. Galileo was able to demonstrate that
    the shadows of Venus were consistent with the planet orbiting the Sun rather than
    the Earth.

    almanacs that predicted the positions of celestial objects at specific future
    dates and times. If sailors knew how high different celestial objects were above
    the horizon at different latitudes and different dates of the year, they could
    find the latitude by measuring their angles and consulting the relevant date in
    the almanac. This facilitated [open sea navigation](https://press.uchicago.edu/books/HOC/HOC_V3_Pt1/HOC_VOLUME3_Part1_chapter20.pdf),
    as sailors with knowledge of the latitude of their destination could sail north
    or south until the position in the sky of the Sun or some other celestial object
    indicated that they had reached the desired latitude, and then sail along it.
    This released them from having to follow the coast. The importance of having the
    right latitude was amply demonstrated in [1707](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scilly_naval_disaster_of_1707)
    when more than 1,400 British sailors drowned after four British warships crashed
    into the Isles of Scilly off the coast of Cornwall, due to a 24–36-nautical-mile
    misestimation of their latitude (not just a mistake in longitude, as common belief
    would have it).

    Petty championed a new science called ‘[political arithmetic](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Political_Arithmetick_(1899))’,
    which sought quantitative precision in matters relating to taxes, expenditure,
    trade, and monetary issues. Another Englishman, John Graunt, is often regarded
    as the founder of demography due to his analysis of mortality rates in his work,
    [*Natural and Political Observations Made upon the Bills of Mortality*](https://wellcomecollection.org/works/jt43sbkc).
    Subsequently, life tables and the new theory of probability were combined to support
    pricing in the emerging life insurance industry, with the Dutchman Johan de Witt’s
    [*The Worth of Life Annuities Compared to Redemption Bonds*](https://www.york.ac.uk/depts/maths/histstat/dewitt.pdf)
    (1671) considered one of the earliest applications of probability theory to finance.
    Building on these advances, the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries saw the evolution
    of modern disciplines such as economics, epidemiology, demography, and actuarial
    science.

    real-world situation. For example, when Galileo studied uniform acceleration,
    he first measured the time taken for a ball to roll down inclines of different
    lengths. Similarly, an accountant converts an inventory of physical goods, assets,
    and transactions into a set of quantities that are expressed in a common monetary
    unit and allocated to different cost, revenue, asset, and liability accounts.
    In both cases, the end product is a mathematical representation.

    models to process the representation. Galileo needed to compute ratios to discover
    that the time for a ball to roll down an incline grows as the square root of the
    distance of the incline. Accountants calculate profits as the difference between
    total revenues and costs, and equity as the difference between total assets and
    total liabilities. In both cases, the end product is a mathematical result.

    In physics, it could be the design of a clock that depends on laws of motion,

    infer the diffusion of cultural traits from the spread of attendant artifacts
    and behavioral patterns, similar to our procedure in the innovation narrative.
    However, in principle, the diffusion of cultural traits can also be observed directly
    through the process of learning and imitation. While often difficult in practice,
    this route is possible for the calculation paradigm, since mathematics is almost
    universally learned through schools and textbook materials.
