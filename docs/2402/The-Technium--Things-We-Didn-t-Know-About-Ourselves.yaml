- en: The fact that everyone alive on our planet is now connected electronically is
    not a surprise. This universal connection has been a scifi theme for many decades
    before it happened, and this view of universal connection was not that difficult
    to imagine once radios were invented. Televisions connecting each other seemed
    inevitable once we had telephones. They were called desktop picture phones at
    first, and they were long expected, and in fact by this century considered long
    overdue.

  zh: 每个活在我们星球上的人现在都通过电子方式连接在一起并不奇怪。这种普遍连接在它发生之前就是科幻的主题，而这种普遍连接的观点在无线电发明之后并不难以想象。一旦我们有了电话，电视机连接彼此似乎是不可避免的。它们起初被称为桌面图像电话，长期以来一直被期待，并且实际上被认为在本世纪是迟到的。
- en: But the smartphone — a small pocketable screen – was not at all expected. It
    was a complete surprise because no one thought it would be possible to engage
    with such a tiny screen. It was a shock to everyone (including me)  that a screen
    smaller than my palm would be enough to watch a movie, or read a book, or get
    your news. That kind of behavior seemed to go against “what everybody knows” about
    movie watching and book reading. In fact the idea of an appealing micro-window
    seemed contrary to what we thought we knew about our physiology – that we needed
    a wide view with high fidelity, and that it was unnatural and uncomfortable to
    have to restrict our gazes into such a tiny screen. Turns out we were very wrong.
    We have zero trouble watching hours of movies on this sliver of a screen. This
    comfort with a small screen was one of many things we did not know about ourselves.

  zh: 但智能手机——一个可以装在口袋里的小屏幕——一点也不被期待。它完全是一个惊喜，因为没有人认为能够用如此小的屏幕进行交互是可能的。对于一个比我的手掌还小的屏幕足以观看电影、阅读书籍或获取新闻的想法，对每个人（包括我在内）都是震惊的。这种行为似乎违背了关于观看电影和阅读书籍的“所有人都知道”的理解。事实上，对一个吸引人的微观视窗的想法似乎与我们对自己生理的认识相矛盾——我们需要宽广的视野和高保真度，并且限制我们的视线集中到如此微小的屏幕上是不自然和不舒服的。结果我们是非常错误的。我们毫无困难地在这个狭窄的屏幕上看几个小时的电影。对于我们自己对小屏幕的这种舒适感是我们不知道的许多事情之一。
- en: There are so many other things we didn’t know about ourselves. We had been painting
    and observing images for thousands of years before we discovered that we can fool
    our own eyes and minds to perceive motion by rapidly flicking a series of images
    with minor alterations. These illusions are called movies. We didn’t know we had
    this ability to perceive motion until we had the technology to manifest this ability.
    In other words, we could not have known this about ourselves until we invented
    cinema.

  zh: 还有许多其他关于我们自己的事情我们不知道。在我们发现我们可以通过快速改变一系列图像中的微小变化来欺骗自己的眼睛和头脑以感知运动之前，我们已经数千年在绘画和观察图像了。这些错觉被称为电影。在我们发明了这种能力的技术之前，我们并不知道我们有这种感知运动的能力。换句话说，直到我们发明了电影，我们才能知道这一点。
- en: We are discovering something similar with VR. We didn’t know we can be convinced
    of the presence of something by generating a volumetric, spatial image of it. 
    Rendering an image spatial makes it feel like it is present, even when our logical
    mind knows it is not. This trick makes VR worlds feel real. We also could not
    have known this about our own eyes until we invented VR technology.

  zh: 我们正在通过虚拟现实发现类似的事物。我们并不知道通过生成一个体积感的空间图像来说服我们存在某物是可能的。将图像渲染为空间使其感觉像是存在的，即使我们的逻辑头脑知道它实际上并不存在。这个技巧使得虚拟现实世界感觉真实。我们也直到发明了虚拟现实技术，才知道我们的眼睛有这种特性。
- en: I am pretty sure that we did not know that we humans much prefer personal attention
    to personal privacy. Until we invented the technology of social media, we thought
    we naturally favored privacy over attention, but we were also wrong about that.
    We found out that when given a choice people prefer to reveal themselves to get
    personal attention rather than the obscurity of privacy.

  zh: 我非常确定，我们并不知道我们人类更喜欢个人关注而不是个人隐私。直到我们发明了社交媒体技术之前，我们认为我们自然更偏爱隐私而不是关注，但我们对此也是错误的。我们发现，当给人们选择时，他们更喜欢揭示自己以获得个人关注，而不是隐私的默默无闻。
- en: All this should make us wonder how many other things we don’t know about ourselves?
    And what kind of technology do we need to uncover them? Also, it is possible that
    every bit of complex technology will in its turn reveal to us something about
    ourselves we did not know. Part of inventing and taming our inventions is coming
    to terms with the new things we learn about ourselves.

  zh: 所有这些都应该让我们想知道，我们自己还有多少其他事情不知道？我们需要什么样的技术来揭示它们？此外，每一项复杂技术都有可能揭示出我们自己不曾知晓的某些内容。发明和驯服我们的发明的一部分，是接受我们从中学到的关于自己的新事物。
