- en: Using the European Southern Observatory’s (ESO) Very Large Telescope (VLT),
    astronomers have characterised a bright quasar, finding it to be not only the
    brightest of its kind, but also the most luminous object ever observed. Quasars
    are the bright cores of distant galaxies and they are powered by supermassive
    black holes. The black hole in this record-breaking quasar is growing in mass
    by the equivalent of one Sun per day, making it the fastest-growing black hole
    to date.

- en: The black holes powering [quasars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quasar) collect
    matter from their surroundings in a process so energetic that it emits vast amounts
    of light. So much so that quasars are some of the brightest objects in our sky,
    meaning even distant ones are visible from Earth. As a general rule, the most
    luminous quasars indicate the fastest-growing supermassive black holes.

    mass of 17 billion Suns, and eats just over a Sun per day. This makes it the most
    luminous object in the known Universe,*” says Christian Wolf, an astronomer at
    the Australian National University (ANU) and lead author of the study published
    today in *Nature Astronomy*. The quasar, called J0529-4351, is so far away from
    Earth that its light took over 12 billion years to reach us.

- en: The matter being pulled in toward this black hole, in the form of a disc, emits
    so much energy that J0529-4351 is over 500 trillion times more luminous than the
    Sun [[1]](#1). “*All this light comes from a hot accretion disc that measures
    seven light-years in diameter — this must be the largest accretion disc in the
    Universe,*" says ANU PhD student and co-author Samuel Lai. Seven light-years is
    about 15 000 times the distance from the Sun to the orbit of Neptune.

- en: And, remarkably, this record-breaking quasar was hiding in plain sight. “*It
    is a surprise that it has remained unknown until today, when we already know about
    a million less impressive quasars. It has literally been staring us in the face
    until now*,” says co-author Christopher Onken, an astronomer at ANU. He added
    that this object showed up in images from the ESO Schmidt Southern Sky Survey
    dating back to 1980, but it was not recognised as a quasar until decades later.

- en: Finding quasars requires precise observational data from large areas of the
    sky. The resulting datasets are so large, researchers often use machine-learning
    models to analyse them and tell quasars apart from other celestial objects. However,
    these models are trained on existing data, which limits the potential candidates
    to objects similar to those already known. If a new quasar is more luminous than
    any other previously observed, the programme might reject it and classify it instead
    as a star not too distant from Earth.

- en: An automated analysis of data from the European Space Agency’s Gaia satellite
    passed over J0529-4351 for being too bright to be a quasar, suggesting it to be
    a star instead. The researchers identified it as a distant quasar last year using
    observations from the ANU 2.3-metre telescope at the Siding Spring Observatory
    in Australia. Discovering that it was the most luminous quasar ever observed,
    however, required a larger telescope and measurements from a more precise instrument.
    The [X-shooter spectrograph](https://www.eso.org/public/teles-instr/paranal-observatory/vlt/vlt-instr/x-shooter/)
    on ESO’s [VLT](https://www.eso.org/public/teles-instr/paranal-observatory/vlt/)
    in the Chilean Atacama Desert provided the crucial data.

    the [GRAVITY+](https://www.eso.org/public/teles-instr/paranal-observatory/vlt/vlt-instr/gravity+/)
    upgrade on ESO’s VLT Interferometer ([VLTI](https://www.eso.org/public/teles-instr/paranal-observatory/vlt/vlti/)),
    which is designed to [accurately measure the mass](https://www.eso.org/public/announcements/ann24002/)
    of black holes, including those far away from Earth. Additionally, ESO’s Extremely
    Large Telescope ([ELT](https://elt.eso.org/)), a 39-metre telescope under construction
    in the Chilean Atacama Desert, will make identifying and characterising such elusive
    objects even more feasible.

    of the mysteries of the early Universe, including how they and their host galaxies
    formed and evolved. But that’s not the only reason why Wolf searches for them.
    *“Personally, I simply like the chase,”* he says. “*For a few minutes a day, I
    get to feel like a child again, playing treasure hunt, and now I bring everything
    to the table that I have learned since*.”

    that the Hubble Space Telescope had discovered a quasar, J043947.08+163415.7,
    as bright as 600 trillion Suns. However, that quasar’s brightness was magnified
    by a ‘lensing’ galaxy, located between us and the distant quasar. The actual luminosity
    of J043947.08+163415.7 is estimated to be equivalent to about [11 trillion Suns](https://esahubble.org/news/heic1902/#2)

    the secrets of the Universe for the benefit of all. We design, build and operate
    world-class observatories on the ground — which astronomers use to tackle exciting
    questions and spread the fascination of astronomy — and promote international
    collaboration for astronomy. Established as an intergovernmental organisation
    in 1962, today ESO is supported by 16 Member States (Austria, Belgium, Czechia,
    Denmark, France, Finland, Germany, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal,
    Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom), along with the host state
    of Chile and with Australia as a Strategic Partner. ESO’s headquarters and its
    visitor centre and planetarium, the ESO Supernova, are located close to Munich
    in Germany, while the Chilean Atacama Desert, a marvellous place with unique conditions
    to observe the sky, hosts our telescopes. ESO operates three observing sites:
    La Silla, Paranal and Chajnantor. At Paranal, ESO operates the Very Large Telescope
    and its Very Large Telescope Interferometer, as well as survey telescopes such
    as VISTA. Also at Paranal ESO will host and operate the Cherenkov Telescope Array
    South, the world’s largest and most sensitive gamma-ray observatory. Together
    with international partners, ESO operates ALMA on Chajnantor, a facility that
    observes the skies in the millimetre and submillimetre range. At Cerro Armazones,
    near Paranal, we are building “the world’s biggest eye on the sky” — ESO’s Extremely
    Large Telescope. From our offices in Santiago, Chile we support our operations
    in the country and engage with Chilean partners and society.'
