# Print off a QR code for guests to join your WiFi network

The time spent explaining to guests your WiFi password is not time well spent. Depending on your WiFi name and password, it can also be a surprisingly long time — time that could be spent bemoaning your existence over a cup of tea.

What's more, unforseen events may arise that require WiFi access without delay:

*   You've fallen unconscious and a guest needs to google the recovery position
*   A time sensitive logistical issue must be resolved before your guests can relax
*   A guest you'd rather not talk to requires distraction

You can increase the speed and ease of logging a new device onto your WiFi network by **printing off WiFi login QR code.**

## WiFi QR code generator

Use this tool to generate a QR code that allows devices to quickly join a WiFi network. You can download the QR code as a `PNG` or an `SVG` — once downloaded you can print it off a place it somewhere logical.

*The printed off QR code looks nicer and weighs `~0.004g` less if you cut rounded corners into it.*

This tool was built using open source code by [**Kazuhiko Arase** on GitHub.](https://github.com/kazuhikoarase/qrcode-generator/tree/master) Thank you Kazuhiko.

## How to use a WiFi login QR code

If you have an Android or iOS device you can open your camera app and point it at the QR code — an option will appear to login to the WiFi network.
