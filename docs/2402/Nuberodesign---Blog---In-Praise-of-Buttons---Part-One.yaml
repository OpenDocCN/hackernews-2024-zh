    the function of a button (or both) and sell it as “the newest development in design”
    – totally dis­re­gar­ding the needs of the user and compromising your integrity

    curvature of a fingernail. And it doesn’t stop there: The angles of the walls

    That being said, the clickable area in mouse-interfaces *might* sometimes be the
    same in the upper row as in the lower row. In touch interfaces however, that is
    often not the case. There, the actual outline of the graphic – let’s say the minus

    stick out too much in an environment that already has a lot of text in it. Apple’s
    way of showing the user that the two words are actually buttons is done solely
    with colour. The default option of agreeing is also not differentiating itself
    enough from the disagree option. The only difference is a slightly bolder (but
    not really bold) typeface. And lastly, speaking of type­faces, the one that Apple

    “San Francisco”. Granted, this is less important in long text than it is in individual
    words, but since we want the same typeface for both our buttons and the legal
    text, choosing a typeface *like* FF Unit becomes rather obvious. Lastly, I used
    a slight shadow to set apart the scrollable text of the Terms and Conditions from
    the surrounding interface. This too makes for a better visual distinction between

    Unit这样的字体显然更为明智。最后，我使用了轻微的阴影来区分条款和条件的可滚动文本与周围界面。这也使得屏幕上的不同元素之间有更好的视觉区分。
