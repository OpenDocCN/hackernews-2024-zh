- en: For example (going back to pizza), you find out that not every store can track
    precisely when an order is received and when it goes into the oven, so the UI
    becomes a facade — dare I say a lie — where the step from “order received” to
    “pizza in the oven” happens only because of a timer in the UI (and a corporate
    policy of, “all orders must be in the oven within five minutes of being received”).
    It’s not a representation of reality, but a facade of it.

    “We think this will complete, at the most, within ___ time.” So we make progress
    indicators that look like they’re a live, up-to-date representation of progress
    that poll some kind of technological feedback mechanism for live status updates.
    But in reality they’re merely clocks counting down from a set time of “this is
    the most time we think it should take”.'
