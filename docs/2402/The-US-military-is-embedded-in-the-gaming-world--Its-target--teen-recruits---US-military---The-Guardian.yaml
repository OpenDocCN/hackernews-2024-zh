    personnel sit hunched over monitors, their eyes focused on screens as they speak
    into headsets with clipped efficiency. Computer towers and glowing red keyboards
    crowd their desks. This is top-of-the-line gear, used for executing combat missions
    and coordinating strategy – but not with fleets stationed across the world. These
    sailors are playing video games. On the other end of their headsets and screens
    are young gamers they hope to inspire.

    Playing games can, however, improve perceptual and cognitive functions, says Dr
    C Shawn Green, professor of cognitive neuroscience at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.
    The Office of Naval Research funded Green to research how certain games (mainly
    shooters) improve warrior performance. “These games have lots of speed in them,”
    he says. “There’s lots of what we call ‘transient events’ – things pop up on the
    screen and disappear.” He says this can improve basic visual perception as well
    as heighten levels of cognition (such as working memory).

    body, and then you’re carrying your 8lb M4\. Heaven forbid you have a grenade
    attachment, which adds another 5lb to your rifle. And then you have to try and
    get in and out of an upper armored Humvee in a combat zone while you’re getting
