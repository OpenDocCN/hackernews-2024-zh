- en: Matt Mullenweg, CEO of Tumblr owner Automattic, is supposed to be on sabbatical.
    Instead, he’s arguing with Tumblr users over an individual content moderation
    decision, which has sparked communitywide outcry and accusations of transphobia.

- en: Over the last few days, the situation escalated to the point that Mullenweg
    has engaged with the user in question on [other platforms](https://twitter.com/photomatt/status/1760638778010644694)
    and shared private details about her account in public.

- en: The controversy began when a user with the blog name predstrogen was banned.
    Before the ban, she was frustrated with Tumblr because the platform failed to
    take action when she reported that she was being targeted with transmisogynistic
    harassment. This led her to post that she hopes that the CEO “dies a forever painful
    death involving a car covered in hammers that explodes more than a few times and
    hammers go flying everywhere.”

- en: According to Mullenweg, predstrogen was banned for posts that threatened violence
    against Tumblr staff, and specifically cited the “forever painful death” post.
    He also claimed that her clothed transition photos were not what yielded adult
    content violations.

- en: “We generally do not comment on individual cases, but because there seems to
    be mass misinformation around this, I will make an exception and comment on predstrogen,”
    he wrote on his blog, [photomatt](https://www.tumblr.com/photomatt). He added,
    “Tumblr has a number of LGBT+ including trans people on staff, and they see things
    from the inside fully, and they’re not protesting this case.”

- en: Some users said that Mullenweg was overreacting, as the language is so cartoonish
    that it couldn’t be taken seriously. But Mullenweg took the post as a threat.

- en: “Threats of violence are never okay. Threats of violence are not protected speech,”
    he wrote on his blog. “We will work with police and FBI where appropriate, though
    to be clear predstrogen’s case hasn’t warranted that so far. I’m referring to
    what we may potentially do for other threats.”

    on a post from the user who was banned on Tumblr. Then, on [one of his Tumblr
    posts](https://www.tumblr.com/photomatt/743030472054079489/you-gonna-do-anything-or-make-any-statement-about?source=share),
    Mullenweg shared numerous of her side blog names, which is not public information
    (Tumblr users often make empty side blogs with no content in order to squat on
    URLs).

- en: “On the adult content mistagging, I added context to say it has nothing to do
    with clothed transition photos, she had 20+ other blogs and multiple accounts
    with names so explicit I can’t post them here without a mature tag,” Mullenweg
    wrote, then listing some of the accounts by name.

- en: Aside from Elon Musk since he took over Twitter (now X), it’s uncommon to see
    the CEOs of social platforms commenting directly on individual content moderation
    decisions. It’s even more uncommon for those CEOs to share private information
    about that user’s account.

    manner](https://techcrunch.com/2023/06/08/blueskys-growing-pains-strain-relationship-with-its-black-community-moderation/).
    One user said that they hoped a prominent Black user would get pushed off of “somewhere
    real high.” In that case, Bluesky’s team decided it wasn’t a legitimate death
    threat, which strained the burgeoning platform’s relationship with its Black users.

    Bluesky CEO Jay Graber [posted](https://bsky.app/profile/jay.bsky.team/post/3jwqmz66bdo2w)
    at the time. “We debated whether a ‘death threat’ needs to be specific and direct
    in order to cause harm, and what it would mean for people’s ability to engage
    in heated discussions on Bluesky if we prohibited this kind of speech.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When juxtaposed, these two moderation decisions show the difficulty that platforms
    have in making decisions about certain types of speech. While Bluesky deemed that
    getting shoved from “somewhere real high” is hyperbolic, Tumblr decided that “a
    forever painful death involving a car covered in hammers that explodes more than
    a few times and hammers go flying everywhere” is a sound threat.

- en: Tumblr is in an extended downward spiral. Tumblr was acquired by Yahoo (now
    TechCrunch’s parent company) for $1 billion in 2013, but the platform struggled
    to the point that Automattic bought Tumblr for just $3 million in 2019\. Last
    year, Mullenweg said that the platform loses $30 million each year, and later,
    he [reassigned](https://techcrunch.com/2023/11/10/automattic-ceo-matt-mullenweg-details-tumblrs-future-after-re-org/)
    the majority of Tumblr’s staff to other projects inside of Automattic. But no
    one on the trust and safety team was reassigned, so these moderation decisions
    likely weren’t impacted by the company shake-up. However, Tumblr has a bad track
    record for content moderation decisions, especially those involving trans people.

- en: “We did have an external contract moderator last year that was making transphobic
    moderation (and also selling moderation, criminally),” Mullenweg wrote on his
    blog. “As soon as we were aware that person was fired, and we later terminated
    the entire relationship with that contracting firm and have brought almost everything
    in-house (at great cost).”

- en: Mullenweg pinned a post to his Tumblr titled “[My Beliefs and Principles](https://www.tumblr.com/photomatt/742964297818390528/my-beliefs-and-principles?source=share),”
    where he addresses the claims that he is transphobic. He is currently on sabbatical
    until May.
