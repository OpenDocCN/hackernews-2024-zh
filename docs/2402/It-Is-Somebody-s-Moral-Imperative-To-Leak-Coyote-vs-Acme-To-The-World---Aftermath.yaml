    despite initially walking back its decision, Warner Bros. is indeed intent on
    throwing *Coyote vs Acme*--a funded, shot and completed motion picture--in the
    trash. Not because it sucks, but to save some money on taxes.

    Disney TV shows](https://gizmodo.com/disney-streaming-cuts-tax-writeoffs-1850502594)
    to a *Batgirl* movie has met with the same fate--but this one stung a little more.
    Disney and HBO removing TV shows that people had already had a chance to see was
    one thing, and *Batgirl*[was reportedly also very bad](https://www.nme.com/en_au/news/film/batgirl-movie-so-bad-not-releasable-says-dc-studios-3390857#:~:text='Batgirl'%20movie%20was%20so%20bad%20it%20was%20%E2%80%9Cnot,releasable%E2%80%9D%2C%20says%20DC%20Studios%20boss&text=Leslie%20Grace%20as%20'Batgirl'%20CREDIT,Grace%2C%20Brandon%20Fraser%20and%20J.K.),
    which was another.

    Green, written by *May December's* Samy Burch, produced by (among others) James
    Gunn and starring characters that define Warner Bros.' entire existence--was paid
    for, is finished, is ready to be seen, and now it stands a very real chance of
    being deleted forever, just to save a company some money.

    only made to be fed into a woodchipper to serve shareholders, and it's one [that's
    been covered extensively elsewhere](https://www.looper.com/1161829/hollywood-creatives-are-breathing-fire-over-the-current-trend-of-tv-tax-write-offs/),
    so I'm not going to get into the reeds over the politics and economics of the
    decision here.

- en: What I am going to say, though, is that if you work at Warner Bros., or anywhere
    related to Warner Bros., and you have any access to this movie whatsoever, it's
    your moral imperative to leak it to the world before it's too late. If Warner
    Bros. don't want to release it, and have reportedly blocked attempts for other
    companies to release it, then what does it matter?

    If we can't buy or rent the thing, and likely never will be able to do so via
    legal means, then leaking this movie and putting it on torrent sites shouldn't
    be seen as stealing, either. By all accounts Warner CEO David Zaslav is happy
    throwing this movie in the bin, without selling a single theatre ticket or digital
    rental, so whether we get to see it for free or not doesn't move that financial
    needle one bit.

  zh: 正如我们*先前所述*，[没有所有权就没有盗版](https://aftermath.site/there-is-no-piracy-without-ownership)。如果我们无法通过合法手段购买或租赁这个东西，而且很可能永远也无法这样做，那么泄漏这部电影并将其放在种子网站上也不应被视为偷窃。据所有报道，华纳首席执行官大卫·扎斯拉夫很高兴将这部电影丢进垃圾箱，而没有售出一张电影票或数字租赁，因此无论我们是否免费观看，都不会在财务上有任何影响。
- en: What leaking the movie *would* do is save a piece of art that hundreds of people
    poured their hearts and souls into for months or even *years*. That shouldn't
    be a crime. That's public service.
