    If we follow a universal logic, yes, we shouldn't apologize for something that
    isn't our fault.

- en: However, we should always put in value the user-centered approach with the end
    purpose of making the user feel comfortable no matter what. In this regard, an
    apologetic approach is the best solution.

    you must treat the situation very carefully, thinking of all the cognitive and
    psychological implications. This is what truly matters, not everyday life logic.

    frustrated. When you feel frustrated, you want someone's apology. Yes, you blame
    everyone and everything around you, but yourself.

    recover from it. This will reduce the user's frustration so much!
