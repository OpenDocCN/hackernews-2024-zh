    open-source contributions", complete with a flashy website describing how it would
    "enhance the sustainability of open-source software".

- en: So far, it's achieved the exact opposite. Promising to reward open source contributors
    with crypto tokens, the project asked users to verify their access to open source
    projects by merging in a YAML file containing their crypto wallet address. This
    kicked off a flood of [pull requests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_version_control#Pull_requests)
    to prominent, often non-crypto-related open source projects by people who had
    never contributed to the project (or, often, *any* open source project), but who
    wished to merge in a file describing them as a "code owner".

- en: 'Particularly impacted by this project was the open source blogging platform
    Ghost, which was used as an example in the demo video released by tea.xyz, and
    which received several PRs of this kind. A somewhat flummoxed maintainer of the
    repository replied to one PR: "[I]n practice the TEA project is not helping to
    support the Ghost project, but is instead causing a rush of self-serving PRs to
    be submitted to cash-in on other people''s work. ... This why people hate on crypto."
    A maintainer of another unrelated open source project called "ghost" also reported
    receiving an influx of spam PRs.'

    [another recent incident](https://www.web3isgoinggreat.com/?id=airdrop-hunters-spam-github-projects)
    was (blessedly) mostly limited to open-source crypto projects and didn't waste
    the time of non-crypto-related projects as this one has.
