# Think Python, 3rd edition

*Think Python* is an introduction to Python for people who have never programmed before – or for people who have tried and had a hard time.

[Here is the landing page for the book at Green Tea Press](https://greenteapress.com/wp/think-python-3rd-edition/).

For the third edition, the biggest changes are:

*   The book is now entirely in Jupyter notebooks, so you can read the text, run the code, and work on the exercises, all in one place. Using the links below, you can run the notebooks on Colab, so you don’t have to install anything to get started.

*   The text is substantially revised and a few chapters have been reordered. There are more exercises now, and I think a lot of them are better.

*   At the end of every chapter, there are suggestions for using tools like ChatGPT and Colab AI to learn more and to get help with the exercises.

The book is scheduled to be published by O’Reilly Media in June 2024. You can pre-order now from [O’Reilly Media](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/think-python/9781098155421/) or [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/_/dp/1098155432?smid=ATVPDKIKX0DER&_encoding=UTF8&tag=oreilly20-20&_encoding=UTF8&tag=greenteapre01-20&linkCode=ur2&linkId=e2a529f94920295d27ec8a06e757dc7c&camp=1789&creative=9325) or, if you would like to support local bookstores, [Bookshop.org](https://bookshop.org/a/98697/9781098155438).

## Resources for teachers

If you are teaching with this book, here are some resources you might find useful.

*   You can download notebooks with solutions from [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/AllenDowney/ThinkPythonSolutions/tree/v3/soln).

*   Quizzes for each chapter, and a summative quiz for the whole book, are available on request.

*   *Teaching and Learning with Jupyter* is an online book with suggestions for using Jupyter effectively in the classroom. You can [read the book here](https://jupyter4edu.github.io/jupyter-edu-book).

*   One of the best ways to use notebooks in the classroom is live coding, where an instructor writes code and students follow along in their own notebooks. To learn about live coding – and a lot of other great advice about teaching programming – I recommend the teacher training provided by The Carpentries, [which you can read here](https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training).
