    a movie set. But Lenovo’s Project Crystal, supposedly the world’s first laptop
    with a transparent microLED display, is an example of sci-fi come to life.

- en: Currently there are no plans to turn Project Crystal into a retail product.
    Instead Lenovo’s latest concept device was commissioned by its ThinkPad division
    to explore the potential of transparent microLED panels and AI integration. The
    most obvious use case would be sharing info somewhere, like a doctor’s office
    or a hotel desk. Instead of needing to flip a screen around, you could simply
    reverse the display via software, allowing anyone on the other side to see it
    while getting an in-depth explanation.

    there could be possible AR applications. One example would be to use the camera
    to identify an object, similar to Google Lens. And with its transparent display,
    it should be possible to take that idea a step further by overlaying a diagram
    or schematic on top of the object for things like troubleshooting or repair.

- en: But the best thing about Project Crystal, is that Lenovo bothered making it
    at all. Currently, even standard microLED displays are extremely expensive with
    those panels typically reserved for cutting-edge gadgets like Samsung’s [The Wall](https://www.engadget.com/samsung-the-wall-virtual-movie-studio-121524064.html)
    or [Apple’s Vision Pro](https://www.engadget.com/apple-vision-pro-review-beta-testing-the-future-201430272.html).
    And, see-through versions have only been seen as concepts like on the [transparent
    microLED TV Samsung showed off](https://www.engadget.com/samsung-debuts-the-worlds-first-transparent-microled-screen-at-ces-2024-042634398.html)
    a couple of months ago at CES 2024.

- en: In person, the transparency effect is bewildering. When closed or when its display
    is off, Project Crystal’s screen almost looks like an ordinary piece of glass
    with a slight brownish tint. But at a moment’s notice the whole thing lights up
    like a battleship*.* Nominal brightness goes all the way up to 1,000 nits, with
    Lenovo saying peaks can go as high as 3,000 nits, which would make it brighter
    than the new [Galaxy S24 family.](https://www.engadget.com/galaxy-s24-ultra-review-samsungs-ai-reinforcements-have-arrived-specs-price-191508062.html)
    And despite being made of multiple layers, the panel is extremely thin, which
    helps blur the line being the digital and analog worlds. Lenovo says it's also
    considering adding some sort of contrast layer, so it can turn into a traditional
    opaque display at the touch of a button. However, for a relatively large 16-inch
    display, its resolution isn’t super high, so if you look closely you can see individual
    pixels.

- en: Another design twist is that instead of a traditional keyboard, Project Crystal
    features one of Lenovo’s touch-based replacements similar to those on older [Yoga
    Books](https://www.engadget.com/2018-10-25-lenovo-yoga-book-c930-review-an-expensive-experiment.html).
    Unfortunately, it still suffers from a lot of the same issues. The most obvious
    example of this is that your hands drift while typing because there’s no tactile
    feedback, which leads to decreased accuracy. Lenovo says AI may be able to address
    that in the future by learning a person’s typing habits and then using that info
    to account for your hands straying from the home row. But right now, it’s still
    a problem.

- en: The rest of the laptop is very much a work in progress, too. I only saw two
    ports on the entire system which would be a major faux pas for a notebook this
    big. Project Crystal is also based on a last-gen CPU, while other components like
    its hinge was so weak that its screen threatened to close anytime it tilted below
    90 degrees. And for some reason, the laptop seemed to build up a static charge,
    as it sometimes shocked people who touched its display.

- en: Project Crystal is a solution in search of a problem. A problem that does exist
    in niche situations and may be an issue worth tackling more seriously down the
    line. But more importantly, it’s challenging us to think about what is possible
    with emerging display technology and how it might fit into a laptop of the future.
