- en: The vantage point of each is insistently high. Junghuhn’s affection for the
    aerial view, which he [called](http://www.caans-acaen.ca/Journal/issues_online/Issue_XVII_i_ii_1996/BEEKMAN.pdf)
    the “instructive vista”, was born of many factors, including philosophical prerogative.
    Like Humboldt and Thoreau, he privileged the eye as the best teacher of all —
    better than books, better than tutors, better than hands. But also, he judged
    the elevated mountain climate more pleasant, the major flora more dignified, and
    the cultural traditions more refined than at lower elevations. (Tengger, Sumatran,
    and Sundanese villages were higher than those of the Javanese, who lived near
    sea level, and for whom Junghuhn had total contempt.) The Hindu Sundanese, for
    instance, surrounded their villages with tall hedges of bamboo, which Junghuhn
    found charming; the volcano they worshiped, the nearby Bromo, struck him as deserving
    of worship. Junghuhn came to the conclusion that height truly does equal greatness,
    and mapped his preferences accordingly. One could predict his fondness for specific
    plants, animals, and humans based on their level of elevation. ※
