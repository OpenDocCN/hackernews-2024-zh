    Journal* continues to search for the elusive Planet Nine (also called [Planet
    X](https://science.nasa.gov/solar-system/planet-x/)), which is a hypothetical
    planet that potentially orbits in the outer reaches of the solar system and well
    beyond the orbit of the dwarf planet, Pluto. The goal of this study was to narrow
    down the possible locations of Planet Nine and holds the potential to help researchers
    better understand the makeup of our solar system, along with its formation and
    evolutionary processes. So, what was the motivation behind this study regarding
    narrowing down the location of a potential Planet Nine?

    approximately 78 percent of possible locations that were calculated from previous
    studies. Additionally, the researchers also provided new estimates for the approximate
    semimajor axis (measured in astronomical units (AU)) and Earth-mass size of Planet
    Nine at 500 and 6.6, respectively. So, what are the most significant results from
    this study, and what follow-up studies are currently being conducted or planned?

    Nine, we didn’t,” Dr. Brown tells *Universe Today*. “So instead, it means that
    we have significantly narrowed the search area. We’ve now surveyed approximately
    80% of the regions where we think Planet Nine might be.”

    the LSST is the most likely survey to find Planet Nine. When it comes online in
    a year or two it will quickly cover much of the search space and, if Planet Nine
    is there, find it.”

    and is an astronomical survey currently scheduled as a 10-year program to study
    the southern sky and take place at the Vera C. Rubin Observatory in Chile, which
    is presently under construction. Objectives for LSST include studying identifying
    near-Earth asteroids (NEAs) and small planetary bodies within our solar system,
    but also include deep space studies, as well. These include investigating the
    properties of dark matter and dark energy and the evolution of the Milky Way Galaxy.
    But what is the importance of finding Planet Nine?

    our solar system and the only one with a mass between Earth and Uranus. Such planets
    are common around other stars, and we would suddenly have a chance to study one
    in our own solar system.”

    discovery of Neptune in 1846, including an [1880 memoir](https://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu/pdf/1880Obs.....3..439K)
    authored by D. Kirkwood and later a [1946 paper](https://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu/pdf/1946ASPL....5...73T)
    authored by American astronomer, Clyde Tombaugh, who was responsible for discovering
    Pluto in 1930\. More recent studies include studies from [2016](https://www.universetoday.com/126969/astronomers-find-theoretical-evidence-for-distant-giant-planet-in-our-solar-system/)
    and [2017](https://www.universetoday.com/136450/evidence-mounts-existence-planet-nine/)
    presenting evidence for the existence of Planet Nine, the former of which was
    co-authored by Dr. Brown. This most recent study marks the most complete investigation
    of narrowing down the location of Planet Nine, which Dr. Brown has long-believed
    exists, telling *Universe Today*, “There are too many separate signs that Planet
    Nine is there. The solar system is very difficult to understand without Planet
    Nine.”

- en: He continues by telling *Universe Today* that “…Planet Nine explains many things
    about orbits of objects in the outer solar system that would be otherwise unexplainable
    and would each need some sort of separate explanation. The cluster of the directions
    of the orbits is the best know, but there is also the large perihelion distances
    of many objects, existence of highly inclined and even retrograde objects, and
    the high abundance of very eccentric orbits which cross inside the orbit of Neptune.
    None of these should happen in the solar system, but all are easily explainable
    as an effect of Planet Nine.”
