  zh: 这种办公室回归也出现在关于[始终呆在办公室的重要性](https://www.businessinsider.com/are-remote-jobs-more-productive-work-life-balance-return-office-2023-8)的混合信号中。最近的一项研究表明，实施[返办公要求](https://www.businessinsider.com/return-to-office-mandates-remote-work-stock-returns-productivity-2024-1)的公司实际上并没有更加盈利或者更加高效。但严格的返办公要求的影响不一定局限于资产负债表上的表现，根据Gartner人力资源实践研究总监凯特琳·达菲在接受Business
    Insider采访时的说法。

    in general, were 8% less likely to want to stick around when bosses put in an
    inflexible RTO mandate. Among women, 11% were less likely to want to stay. That's
    partly because women often value flexibility and might feel they face less bias
    when they're not in the office, according to the survey.
