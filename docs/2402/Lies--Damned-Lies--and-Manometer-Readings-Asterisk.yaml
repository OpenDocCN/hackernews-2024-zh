    with the conviction of decades of experience. I, on the other hand, was less certain.
    How could a new furnace “know” that it had just been connected to a 20-year-old
    air conditioner (from a competing brand), somehow read that unit’s cooling capacity,
    and then calibrate its own output to the precisely required airflow? In a bid
    to reconcile the reading on my manometer with the tech’s supposed savvy, I asked
    whether he was certain. He was, he told me, quite positive. “Tell you what,” he
    said. “If I’m wrong, then there’s probably 200 air conditioners in Princeton with
    bad airflow. And that can’t be right.”

    I ran a home remodeling business with my brother. Both of us were well studied
    in energy efficiency and resilient design. When the bottom fell out of the housing
    market, we quickly transitioned our business into air sealing and insulation work.
    The New Jersey Home Performance with Energy Star program was slated to receive
    a sizable infusion of federal funding, and so while residential remodeling might
    collapse, most homes in New Jersey would be eligible to receive rebates for implementing
    energy-saving measures. I took classes and became certified in heating, ventilation
    and air-conditioning, and was responsible for overseeing the HVAC work we subcontracted
    on our projects.

    to local, supposedly expert subcontractors, the homes we worked in were frequently
    plagued by problems: high humidity, lots of noise, room-to-room temperature differences,
    and some full mechanical failures. HVAC training classes were partly a way to
    boost revenue, but I also figured that having that expertise would allow me to
    help our HVAC subcontractors make minor tweaks to greatly improve their installations.
    And that’s how I found myself in a Princeton basement reading a digital display
    that suggested the furnace, in fact, didn’t know it had been connected to anything.
    It had to be told.'

    codes mandate accurate heat load/loss calculations, a process referred to as a
    “Manual J.” There are templates that can be used to speed up the process, but
    accurate measurements must be taken for each house individually, as no template
    can capture all salient variables. Simply rotating a house from north to west,
    for example, will often change cooling demand by 20%. A friend, a technical manager
    of a clean energy program, estimated that, despite decades of investment in training
    and compliance checks, over 90% of Manual Js reviewed by his program had significant
    errors. Some of these were obvious due to internal inconsistency (imagine, for
    example, a contractor listing a duct load on a home heating system that uses water,
    not air). Others, such as home size and orientation, could be easily contradicted
    by public information on Zillow or Google Maps. And this is probably a widespread
    practice.

    did this by keeping on hand Manual J files sorted according to their capacity — 1
    ton, 2 ton, etc. — and then renaming each one to fit the job site address. They
    might still be doing it if the company’s Manual J administrator hadn’t gone on
    vacation. The temporary replacement forgot to rename the files — exposing a practice

    HVAC systems in California, “What Can 13,000 Air Conditioners Tell Us?,” 57% were

    To reopen schools during the COVID-19 pandemic, public health officials asked
    school managers across the country to upgrade their central ducted HVAC system
    filters to a minimum efficiency reporting value of 13 or higher — MERV ratings
    run from 1 to 16, with higher levels more effective in filtering particles — and
    set the fans to run continuously. Higher-rated filters exert increased load on
    HVAC systems via air flow resistance: Imagine breathing through a cheesecloth

    a higher-quality filter is trivial.'

    these systems couldn’t handle the pressure of a filter upgrade. This statement
    was largely taken at face value by public health officials and parents. But as
    far as I can tell, it was very rarely true. In every instance I’m aware of, neither
    the HVAC systems’ specifications nor their actual pressure readings showed that
    they couldn’t be upgraded, and in the vast majority of cases, the people making
    this claim didn’t possess the tools or knowledge to measure system pressure in
    the first place. In the rare instances where higher density filters can be problematic,
    it’s usually simple to offset the increase in pressure by decreasing it elsewhere
    by, for example, adjusting dampers or registers in the ductwork to balance the

    upgrades is almost entirely rooted in a combination of obstinance and ignorance.

    in the first place. My anecdotal experience suggests they’re not. Well into the
    pandemic, a friend who coaches at a Princeton boarding school approached me with
    a diagnostic and repair problem. During high-occupancy sports events, water pooled
    on the floors of the school’s gymnasiums. He was forced to pay assistant coaches
    to hurriedly wipe the floors with towels during breaks in the games. From a ventilation
    standpoint this usually indicates catastrophic failure. It means that occupant
    breathing and sweating is causing massive humidity spikes, and this humidity isn’t
    being ventilated from the building.

    Practically speaking, the ventilation system was almost entirely inoperable. I
    repaired one fan simply by deleting a fault code that had likely locked out operation
    for the entire pandemic. Another needed to be replaced, which is typically a several-hour
    job. The final fan just needed to be manually turned on by pressing a button at
    the start of games. If a school with students from some of the world’s most elite

    error avoidance tool. And since they primarily communicate to technicians, not
