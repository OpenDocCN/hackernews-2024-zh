- en: According to a new study by MediaRadar, Temu’s ad spend jumped 1,000% year-over-year
    for the period from January to November 2023\. Seventy-six percent of Temu’s ad
    spend for the period went to social media, compared to 13% on digital display
    ads, the ad intelligence platform found. Temu is also funneling more money into
    TV and plans to run an ad during the Super Bowl for the second year in a row,
    [according to the Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/articles/chinese-e-commerce-giant-temu-will-return-to-the-super-bowl-59acb7a6).
    Modern Retail reached out to Temu for comment on its marketing spend, but the
    company said it could not provide comment at this time.

    It is a fairly new company, having launched in the United States in September
    2022\. But, over the past year and a half, it’s managed to grow a large volume
    of sales by placing ads on TikTok, Instagram, Google and nearly every other channel
    where people shop. MediaRadar told Modern Retail that from September through December
    2023, Temu spent more than $517 million in national advertising. While Temu’s
    parent company (the Chinese-based PDD Holdings) does not divvy up sales by brand,PDD’s
    total revenue last quarter [reached](https://investor.pddholdings.com/news-releases/news-release-details/pdd-holdings-announces-third-quarter-2023-unaudited-financial)
    68.84 billion yuan ($9.67 billion), an increase of 94% year-over-year. Going forward
    in 2024, Temu shows no signs of slowing its advertising ambitions.

    coming across a Temu ad. And, Temu’s orange boxes are popping up more in package
    rooms and mailrooms. Last summer, a USPS worker pleaded with people to order less
    from Temu in a [viral TikTok.](https://www.dailydot.com/news/usps-worker-complains-about-temu/)
    Next month, more than 100 million people are expected to watch the Super Bowl
    — and with it, a Temu ad that likely cost up to $7 million, by some estimates.

    “never seen a strategy quite like this.”

    aggressiveness,” he said. “They are creating this level of cultural awareness
    that I think is maybe allowing it to enter the mainstream in a way that other
    brands that just try to arbitrage traffic haven’t been able to make that leap.”

    ad data. For instance, Temu is ranked first in “clothing and accessories” ad visibility
    in the United Kingdom over the past 28 days — higher than Amazon, eBay, Asos,
    Shein and Nike. Its ads/organic ratio (meaning how often its products get impressions
    from Google Shopping ads as opposed to organic results) is more than 100\. Amazon’s,
    for comparison, is 10, while eBay’s is 8.

    blasting the market with ads,” Smec’s Ryan told Modern Retail. “Their paid visibility
    alone is more than the paid and organic visibility of these others combined. It’s
    really breathtaking.”

    these ads, Ryan said. Temu’s ads on social media don’t tend to focus on one category,
    meaning they could show flashlights in one carousel slide and lingerie in the
    next. “It’s really surreal,” Ryan said. “It’s this untargeted, brute force kind
    of approach towards advertising. I actually think that their ads within Google
    Search and Shopping are some of their most targeted ads, because Google actually
    takes care of that.”

    them into repeat buyers. In an attempt to answer this, Lipsman calculated the
    ratio of Temu’s daily active users to monthly active users. In September 2022,
    this ratio was 9%, but in October 2023, it reached some 20%, he said. “That’s
    a good sign that it’s getting stickier,” he said.

    million a year prior. Web searches for “Temu” are up 788% worldwide over the past

    of investment might not be needed to remain top of mind,” he wrote.

    Temu ad. A concern that comes to me is, I view this as spamming the auctions.”
