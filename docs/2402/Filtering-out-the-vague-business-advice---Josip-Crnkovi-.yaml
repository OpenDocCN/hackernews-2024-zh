- en: If you're a software developer, at some point in your career, you probably had
    an idea for an app or a SaaS that you wanted to build. You dreamed of making more
    than your job, so that you could focus on it full-time, or just have some disposable
    income. And that's great! You can (most likely) build the product from the development
    perspective, but you have zero idea where to go from there. You have no idea where
    and how to get people to use your product and have even less clue on how to get
    them to actually pay you for the product.

    You need actionable tips and suggestions, something you can do today. Advice like

    **To fly a plane ‚Äî know where you want to go, get in the airplane, and fly it.**
    You''re not really told how to fly a plane; you''re just told to fly it. There
    are thousands of things you need to know before actually flying the plane. It''s
    hard if you don''t know how to do it. And making a profitable business is no different
    ‚Äî it''s hard, especially if you''re doing this for the first time, and alone.'

    only guess that many of these are happening because the founders who shared this
    advice got lucky with a $3k MRR product and now assume they know what they did,
    when in reality they wouldn't be able to do it again. It's kind of similar to
    how some who invested a few thousand in Tesla stock a few years ago are now sharing
    investing advice when, in reality, they got lucky. Or do people just lie about
    the MRR as a method of gaining a larger audience? If you're asked about what did
    you do to grow it to $5k a month and your answer is *"I talked about it online
    and now I just do social media for marketing,"* then I'm sorry but I don't believe
    that you know what got you to make that money and don't know if I should listen
    to you.

    to build a product that people want to pay for nor that there is a single piece
    of advice that can be applied everywhere to grow a startup. It takes time to learn
    this for yourself, to explore different things, listen to podcasts and read books,
    **learn and fail**, and of course to understand that if something worked for someone

    to people who truly know what they're doing and what they're talking about. It
    makes things a whole lot easier. People who could repeat building a profitable
    business, and people who give out concrete content. I'm also not saying that you
    should only listen to advice from the likes of Steve Jobs and Mark Zuckerberg
    because, in reality ‚Äî you're not them and will most likely never build a business
    like theirs. To me, their wisdom is purely motivational. These people have built
    a multi gazillion dollar empires, and you are trying to find a few dozen people/businesses
    to pay for your poorly designed app. Can their advice really help you?

    I'm sure I missed a few, but all these people I respect very much and they have
    built profitable startups and now share incredible content that you can learn
    from and apply to your potential startups. I resonate with some of these guys
    as they are developers who are/were trying to do the same thing as I do, only
    a long time ago, and now they have some stories to tell.
