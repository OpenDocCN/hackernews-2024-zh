["```\n\nＢｉｔｗｉｓｅ 📼 Ｌｉｍｉｎａｌ\nA Short Film in 256 Bytes of Code\n\nProgrammed by KilledByAPixel\nPresented at Lovebyte Party 2024\n\n...\n\nI found an old VHS tape at a yard sale.\nIt was labeled \"Bitwise Liminal\" in sharpie.\nBut when I watched the video it was only static.\n\nThen I started having vivid and... unsettling dreams.\nAlso I couldn't stop thinking about that weird VHS tape.\nAfter researching I learned it was a digital backup.\nUsing some special software I recovered the data.\nTo my shock, it was a 256 byte program...\n\nWith trembling hands I opened it in a web browser.\nStrange. This reminds me of the dreams I've been having.\nNow I don't need to sleep anymore.\nI just keep watching.\n\n...\n```"]
