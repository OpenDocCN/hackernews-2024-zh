    more money or more social status. Or maybe you just want to be a master of the
    craft. All those reasons are valid, even raw ambition is too, as the *want of
    more* is deeply human, and is what moves us forward. The only dubious reason is
    “because that’s what you are supposed to do”. Living by other’s script is a recipe
    for bitterness and regret.

    be better than the average. If your junior coworkers need three rounds of code
    review you must need only one. If others are shy and reticent in meetings you
    must be outspoken and helpful. People must think of you as “one of the best we
    have around here”. You must understand what “normal” looks like, and do much more,
    better, and more often.

    in a way that maximizes team impact and morale, but they are also busy and likely
    not the most socially perceptive person. When you tell them what you want, you
    are making their life easier, since you are making the constraints for their work
    clear. With that information it’s more likely they will find some setup that gives
    you what you want.

    that might be demotivating, it’s valuable information to have. For example, your
    manager might give feedback that will help you grow, or they might tell you the
    company has no budget for promotions this year. With the cards on the table, you
    can then have a frank conversation about what’s best for you. Maybe with their
    blessing and support it’s time to find a new role at another company.
