- en: There's an invisible monster on the loose, barreling through intergalactic space
    so fast that if it were in our solar system, it could travel from Earth to the
    Moon in 14 minutes. This supermassive black hole, weighing as much as 20 million
    Suns, has left behind a never-before-seen 200,000-light-year-long "contrail" of
    newborn stars, twice the diameter of our Milky Way galaxy. It's likely the result
    of a rare, bizarre game of galactic billiards among three massive black holes.
