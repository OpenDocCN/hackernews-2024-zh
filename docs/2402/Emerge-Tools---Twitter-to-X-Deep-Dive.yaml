- en: As iOS apps go, Twitter was as mature as they come. Since [acquiring Tweetie
    in 2010](https://techcrunch.com/2010/04/09/twitter-acquires-tweetie/), Twitter
    has been the dopamine fix of choice for presidents and entrepreneurs alike. Everything
    changed in 2022 when Elon acquired Twitter, cut headcount by 75%, and rebranded
    it to X.

    framework (can also be used for video communication), and Periscope a live-streaming

    to link a few dynamic frameworks quickly.

- en: '"TwitterSPMMigration" suggests that Twitter is moving to Swift Package Manager
    from Cocoapods or Carthage. Yet this framework has been in the app since at least
    May 2022 (the first time Emerge ever analyzed the Twitter app). Back then, "TwitterSPMMigration"
    was ~30 MB compared to the ~80 MB it is now. The migration could still be ongoing
    or paused completely. Maybe Twitter/X is using it as an Umbrella framework. Your
    guess is as good as ours 🤷. From Twitter to X, we have seen an increase in the
    binary size (+3.6 MB) of "TwitterSPMMigration," but seemingly nothing significant.'

    UI components. `TwitterAppeance` is also in the main Twitter target. In all, this
    bundle is shipped 4x in the app. Sharing this one bundle in a dylib would cut
    Twitter's size by 8.4 MB.

    Dynamic frameworks are [designed](/blog/posts/static-vs-dynamic-frameworks-ios-discussion-chat-gpt)
    to share code and resources between two binaries—the framework lives in one place
    and the dynamic linker loads it into the app or extension when it’s launched.

- en: The TwitterAppearance duplication existed before the acquisition. For the most
    part, the new X app hasn't added significant duplication. One exception is the
    "X" logos we pointed out before. In addition to the logos in the main asset catalog,
    the T1Twitter framework is shipping each logo twice in its asset catalog, albeit
    these assets are smaller at ~200 KB.
