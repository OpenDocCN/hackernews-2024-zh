    devices. For most things, that meant finding the `/etc/hosts` file or equivalent
    for the OS, and adding a line to set `youtube.com` to `127.0.0.1`. That effectively
    shuts you out of YouTube the site.
  id: totrans-split-15

    to edit `/etc/hosts` like I did with my machines, but unfortunately that part
    of the filesystem is read-only, and can only be modified if you jail-break your
    phone. App it is.

    hours a day, I started noticing a lot of things. One was that on an average day
    prior to quitting YouTube, I consumed a *lot* of sugar. Multiple desserts, plus
    sugary snacks in between meals, that kind of thing.

    find something to snack on and sit back down. Now, I don't have that kind of "permanently

    the sugar.

    some support. This was a private therapist, so there are costs associated with
    it.

    and talking through ways of working with this stuff. I won't share the personal
    details here, but we covered a decent bit of ground. In the end, as best as I
    could understand, is that while you may have past experiences that caused your
    instincts to protect you, they're just that. We all try to protect ourselves from
    pain and danger. This is a good thing, unless it goes too far and we lose the
    ability to take normal daily risks and live a healthy life.

    work with them.

    as well. The main thing, for me, is how they interact with our brains. Are we
    still able to live healthy lives? Form deep healthy relationships? Take daily
    risks of being our complete selves? Are our brains staying healthy?
