    they don‚Äôt have a chatbot, long wait times, etc.), we make a GPT for that vendor.
    We upload all of the vendor documentation and API docs and point it to the website
    and support docs, etc. Now when the team has a support question, they first ask
    the GPT the question. We find they often get faster, better answers than from
    the vendor itself.‚Äù
