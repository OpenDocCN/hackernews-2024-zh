- en: President Biden’s administration plans to pull back on strict new Environmental
    Protection Agency (EPA) rules that would have forced US automakers to turn EVs
    into their main business by 2032\. That’s [according to *The New York Times*](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/17/climate/biden-epa-auto-emissions.html)*,*
    which wrote yesterday that industry players had moved the administration to give
    them more time to bring down EV costs, and for a nationwide charging infrastructure
    to be more fully built out.

- en: The *Times* writes that labor leaders pressured Biden to give them more time
    to extend union membership to those working in new US EV plants. As the article
    notes, labor union support is crucial as Biden faces re-election where he’s straddling
    a dire climate situation and attacks from candidate and former President Donald
    Trump.

    and 46 percent of new medium-duty sales by 2032 — a huge spike from the 7.6 percent
    the *Times* notes from last year. Sales of EVs have slowed, putting the goal further
    out of reach for a variety of reasons, not least of which is that the auto industry
