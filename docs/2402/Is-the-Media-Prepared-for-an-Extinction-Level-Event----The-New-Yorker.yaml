    political magazine in Washington, D.C., that offered a promising foothold in journalism.
    I helped with the print order, mailed checks to writers—after receiving lots of
    e-mails asking, politely, Where is my money?—and ran the intern program. This
    last responsibility allowed me a small joy: every couple of weeks, a respected
    journalist would come into the office for a brown-bag lunch in our conference
    room, giving our most recent group of twentysomethings a chance to ask for practical
    advice about “making it.” One man told us to embrace a kind of youthful workaholism,
    before we became encumbered by kids and families. An investigative reporter implored
    us to file our taxes and to keep our personal lives in order—never give the rich
    and powerful a way to undercut your journalism. But perhaps the most memorable
    piece of advice was from a late-career writer who didn’t mince words. You want
    to make it in journalism, he said? Marry rich. We laughed. He didn’t.'

    layoffs in the industry in 2023 recorded twenty-six hundred and eighty-one in
    broadcast, print, and digital news media. NBC News, Vox Media, Vice News, Business
    Insider, Spotify, theSkimm, FiveThirtyEight, The Athletic, and Condé Nast—the
    publisher of *The New Yorker*—all made significant layoffs. BuzzFeed News closed,
    as did Gawker. The Washington *Post*, which lost about a hundred million dollars
    last year, offered buyouts to two hundred and forty employees. In just the first
    month of 2024, Condé Nast laid off a significant number of Pitchfork’s staff and
    folded the outlet into *GQ*; the Los Angeles *Times* laid off at least a hundred
    and fifteen workers (their union called it “the big one”); *Time* cut fifteen
    per cent of its union-represented editorial staff; the *Wall Street Journal* slashed
    positions at its D.C. bureau; and *Sports Illustrated*, which had been weathering
    a scandal for publishing A.I.-generated stories, laid off much of its staff as
    well. One journalist recently cancelled a networking phone call with me, writing,
    “I’ve decided to officially take my career in a different direction.” There wasn’t
    much I could say to counter that conclusion; it was perfectly logical.

    Athletic和康泰纳仕——《纽约客》的出版商——都进行了重大裁员。BuzzFeed新闻关闭，Gawker也是如此。华盛顿邮报去年亏损约1亿美元，向240名员工提供了买断协议。仅在2024年的第一个月，康泰纳仕裁减了大量Pitchfork的工作人员，并将该媒体整合到*GQ*中；洛杉矶时报裁减了至少115名工作人员（他们的工会称之为“大事件”）；*时代*杂志削减了15%的工会代表编辑人员；*华尔街日报*在其华盛顿分社裁减了职位；而曾因发布人工智能生成的文章而遭遇丑闻的《体育画报》也裁员了大部分员工。最近，一位记者取消了与我进行的网络电话会议，写道：“我决定正式改变职业方向。”对于这个结论，我无能为力；它完全合乎逻辑。

    a media consultant, wrote in a January newsletter. “I see a potential extinction-level
    event in the future.” Some of the forces cited by Goldstein were already well
    known: consumers are burned out by the news, and social-media sites have moved
    away from promoting news articles. But Goldstein also pointed to Google’s rollout
    of A.I.-integrated search, which answers user queries within the Google interface,
    rather than referring them to outside Web sites, as a major factor in this coming
    extinction. According to a recent *Wall Street Journal* [analysis](https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/news-publishers-see-googles-ai-search-tool-as-a-traffic-destroying-nightmare-52154074),
    Google generates close to forty per cent of traffic across digital media. Brands
    with strong home-page traffic will likely be less affected, Goldstein wrote—places
    like Yahoo, the *Wall Street Journal*, the New York *Times*, the *Daily Mail*,
    CNN, the Washington *Post*, and Fox News. But Web sites that aren’t as frequently

- en: 'During the first three decades of digital publishing, the news media constantly
    reshaped itself to keep up. Blogging and aggregation, neither of which involved
    much expense in terms of original reporting, quickly became the strategy for chasing
    news on the Internet. Playing the search-engine-optimization game—racing to get
    an article within the first page of Google results—insured that your Web site
    got page views. And page views were what mattered: they were a new way of selling
    advertising. Gawker, which launched in 2002, famously had an office leaderboard
    that showed which writer had the best-trafficked story; bonuses were tied to views.
    But the Internet’s exponential growth only depreciated the value of clicks. By
    2008, Gawker was getting half the revenue per page of what it earned in 2004\.
    The model was, the financial journalist Felix Salmon [wrote](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://web.archive.org/web/20120204065500/http://blogs.reuters.com/felix-salmon/2010/12/01/the-new-gawker-media/&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1707495399986980&usg=AOvVaw0zpRcxh-MSacIDuRnS0CdG),

    try every trick in the book to boost their pageviews and ad impressions, just
    to compensate for the fact that their revenues per page are very small. The results—sensationalism,

    Google 搜索结果的第一页——确保你的网站获得页面浏览量。而页面浏览量是重要的：它们成为了售卖广告的新途径。2002 年推出的 Gawker 以办公室的排行榜而闻名，显示出哪个作家的故事获得了最高的流量；奖金与浏览量挂钩。但互联网的指数增长只是贬低了点击的价值。到2008年，Gawker每页的收入仅为2004年的一半。金融记者费利克斯·萨尔蒙在2010年写道，“看起来越来越像是一个向底部竞逐的比赛，出版商拼命尝试各种花招来提升他们的页面浏览量和广告印象，仅仅是为了弥补他们每页的收入非常低的事实。其结果——轰动性新闻、丑闻故事和幻灯片——只会进一步侵蚀广告商眼中这些网站的价值。”

    News, a play for greater prestige that, in some sense, worked: a decade later,
    the site won a Pulitzer Prize. But BuzzFeed News stories, like most BuzzFeed content,
    were available for free. When the venture capitalist Marc Andreessen’s firm gave
    BuzzFeed a fifty-million-dollar cash infusion, in 2014, he told the company to
    worry about growth, not revenue. But ceding distribution to outside tech firms
    hastened much of the industry’s downfall. “Even as Buzzfeed reached more and more

- en: And yet, a few weeks later, Jimmy Finkelstein, the former owner of *The Hill*,
    launched a new ad-supported site, The Messenger. The idea was to create an alternative
    to the mainstream national media, which Finkelstein, who is seventy-four, viewed
    as increasingly partisan. “I remember an era where you’d sit by the TV, when I
    was a kid with my family, and we’d all watch ‘60 Minutes’ together,” he [told
    the *Times*](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/10/business/media/the-messenger-jimmy-finkelstein.html).
    “Those days are over, and the fact is, I want to help bring those days back.”
    The site hired hundreds of journalists, and promised to cover sports, politics,
    and entertainment. Executives said that they expected a hundred million monthly
    visitors and to generate a hundred million dollars in a year, mostly through advertising.
    The endeavor lasted less than a year; Finkelstein abruptly dissolved The Messenger
    in January, pulled down the Web site, and left his employees without severance
    or health care. The ordeal demonstrated the media’s poverty of ideas for how to
    survive without robust advertising; the past two years have seen steady drops
    in ad revenue across the industry, even as tech companies somewhat recovered.
    “No one who knew anything would think you can make money off traffic and hit the
    dumbass numbers he put out there,” Jim VandeHei, the co-founder of Axios and Politico,
    told the news site Puck in the aftermath. “I was pissed the moment I heard about
    this dumb idea. It was business malpractice and human cruelty at an epic scale.”

    Minutes’，”他告诉*Times*。“那些日子一去不复返了，事实上，我想帮助恢复那些日子。”该网站雇佣了数百名记者，并承诺报道体育、政治和娱乐新闻。管理人员表示，他们预计每月将有一亿访问量，并计划在一年内通过广告赚取一亿美元的收入。然而，这个努力只坚持了不到一年；Finkelstein在一月突然解散了The
    Messenger，关闭了网站，让员工们失去了离职金和健康保险。这一事件显示出，媒体在没有充分广告支持的情况下如何生存的想法匮乏；过去两年，整个行业的广告收入稳步下降，尽管科技公司在某种程度上已经复苏。“没有人会认为你可以通过流量赚钱并达到他扯出来的那些愚蠢数字，”Axios和Politico的联合创始人Jim
    VandeHei在事后告诉新闻网站Puck。“一听到这个愚蠢的想法，我就很生气。这是商业失职和人道主义上的大规模残酷。”

    that about two-thirds of the country now has little to no trust in the media—these
    numbers were signs of hope. But the “Trump bump” proved to be a momentary reprieve
    from a sustained and inevitable decline. In 2021, the first year of Joe Biden’s
    Presidency, the *Post*, which is owned by Jeff Bezos, lost about three hundred
    thousand subscribers. The Los Angeles *Times*, which is owned by the billionaire
    Patrick Soon-Shiong, reported an increase in digital subscribers in the summer
    of 2023, but it was about half a million short of Soon-Shiong’s stated goal of
    a million digital subscribers; the paper laid off seventy-four staffers that summer,

    devastating local newsrooms for decades. The *Times* launched its Web site in
    1996, promising “to extend the newspaper’s reach and create new editorial and
    business opportunities in electronic media.” As part of that effort, a “thoughtful,
    unbiased filter”—with “a powerful but user-friendly search function”—would amplify
    its classified offerings nationwide. By then, Craigslist had begun its takeover
    of newspapers’ classifieds revenue; by the mid-two-thousands, newspapers were
    losing money on an Internet where information was increasingly free and ads had
    moved elsewhere. The *Times* lost five hundred and forty-three million dollars
    in 2006\. A couple of years later, the company borrowed some two hundred and twenty-five
    million dollars against its recently completed Times Square building. Only after
    launching a paywall, in 2011, did it find a path back to prosperity. But papers
    serving smaller markets never rebounded: between 2005 and 2024, roughly three
    thousand newspapers in the U.S. have closed. According to the Bureau of Labor
    Statistics, newspapers lost more than forty thousand staffers during the same
    period. Two hundred and four counties in the U.S. now have no local news—high-poverty
    areas are most affected—and, by the end of this year, it’s expected that the U.S.
    will have lost a third of its newspapers. Meanwhile, Craigslist’s founder, Craig
    Newmark, now funds a journalism school that recently announced its intention to
