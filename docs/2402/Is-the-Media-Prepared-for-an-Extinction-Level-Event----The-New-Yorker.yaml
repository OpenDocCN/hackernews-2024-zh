    political magazine in Washington, D.C., that offered a promising foothold in journalism.
    I helped with the print order, mailed checks to writers—after receiving lots of
    e-mails asking, politely, Where is my money?—and ran the intern program. This
    last responsibility allowed me a small joy: every couple of weeks, a respected
    journalist would come into the office for a brown-bag lunch in our conference
    room, giving our most recent group of twentysomethings a chance to ask for practical
    advice about “making it.” One man told us to embrace a kind of youthful workaholism,
    before we became encumbered by kids and families. An investigative reporter implored
    us to file our taxes and to keep our personal lives in order—never give the rich
    and powerful a way to undercut your journalism. But perhaps the most memorable
    piece of advice was from a late-career writer who didn’t mince words. You want
    to make it in journalism, he said? Marry rich. We laughed. He didn’t.'

    layoffs in the industry in 2023 recorded twenty-six hundred and eighty-one in
    broadcast, print, and digital news media. NBC News, Vox Media, Vice News, Business
    Insider, Spotify, theSkimm, FiveThirtyEight, The Athletic, and Condé Nast—the
    publisher of *The New Yorker*—all made significant layoffs. BuzzFeed News closed,
    as did Gawker. The Washington *Post*, which lost about a hundred million dollars
    last year, offered buyouts to two hundred and forty employees. In just the first
    month of 2024, Condé Nast laid off a significant number of Pitchfork’s staff and
    folded the outlet into *GQ*; the Los Angeles *Times* laid off at least a hundred
    and fifteen workers (their union called it “the big one”); *Time* cut fifteen
    per cent of its union-represented editorial staff; the *Wall Street Journal* slashed
    positions at its D.C. bureau; and *Sports Illustrated*, which had been weathering
    a scandal for publishing A.I.-generated stories, laid off much of its staff as
    well. One journalist recently cancelled a networking phone call with me, writing,
    “I’ve decided to officially take my career in a different direction.” There wasn’t
    much I could say to counter that conclusion; it was perfectly logical.

    a media consultant, wrote in a January newsletter. “I see a potential extinction-level
    event in the future.” Some of the forces cited by Goldstein were already well
    known: consumers are burned out by the news, and social-media sites have moved
    away from promoting news articles. But Goldstein also pointed to Google’s rollout
    of A.I.-integrated search, which answers user queries within the Google interface,
    rather than referring them to outside Web sites, as a major factor in this coming
    extinction. According to a recent *Wall Street Journal* [analysis](https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/news-publishers-see-googles-ai-search-tool-as-a-traffic-destroying-nightmare-52154074),
    Google generates close to forty per cent of traffic across digital media. Brands
    with strong home-page traffic will likely be less affected, Goldstein wrote—places
    like Yahoo, the *Wall Street Journal*, the New York *Times*, the *Daily Mail*,
    CNN, the Washington *Post*, and Fox News. But Web sites that aren’t as frequently
    typed into browsers need to “contemplate drastic measures, possibly halving their
    brand portfolios.”'

    analyst, recently wrote in his newsletter, “The Rebooting,” is “a different industry,
    leaner and diminished, often serving as a front operation to other businesses,”
    such as events, e-commerce, and sponsored content. In fact, he told me, what we
    are witnessing is nothing less than the end of the mass-media era. “This is a
    delayed reaction to the commercial Internet itself,” he said. “I don’t know if
    anything could have been done differently.”

    reshaped itself to keep up. Blogging and aggregation, neither of which involved
    much expense in terms of original reporting, quickly became the strategy for chasing
    news on the Internet. Playing the search-engine-optimization game—racing to get
    an article within the first page of Google results—insured that your Web site
    got page views. And page views were what mattered: they were a new way of selling
    advertising. Gawker, which launched in 2002, famously had an office leaderboard
    that showed which writer had the best-trafficked story; bonuses were tied to views.
    But the Internet’s exponential growth only depreciated the value of clicks. By
    2008, Gawker was getting half the revenue per page of what it earned in 2004\.
    The model was, the financial journalist Felix Salmon [wrote](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://web.archive.org/web/20120204065500/http://blogs.reuters.com/felix-salmon/2010/12/01/the-new-gawker-media/&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1707495399986980&usg=AOvVaw0zpRcxh-MSacIDuRnS0CdG),
    in 2010, “looking increasingly like a race to the bottom, where publishers desperately
    try every trick in the book to boost their pageviews and ad impressions, just
    to compensate for the fact that their revenues per page are very small. The results—sensationalism,
    salaciousness, and slideshows—only serve to further erode the value of the sites
    in the eyes of advertisers.”'

    that defined the industry, tailoring content to go viral on various social-media
    giants, such as Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube. In 2011, the site launched BuzzFeed
    News, a play for greater prestige that, in some sense, worked: a decade later,
    the site won a Pulitzer Prize. But BuzzFeed News stories, like most BuzzFeed content,
    were available for free. When the venture capitalist Marc Andreessen’s firm gave
    BuzzFeed a fifty-million-dollar cash infusion, in 2014, he told the company to
    worry about growth, not revenue. But ceding distribution to outside tech firms
    hastened much of the industry’s downfall. “Even as Buzzfeed reached more and more
    people on platforms like YouTube and Snapchat, traffic seemed to be losing value
    at the same rate,” Ben Smith, the former editor-in-chief of BuzzFeed News, wrote
    in his 2023 book, “[Traffic](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/05/15/traffic-ben-smith-book-review).”

    News, and published a memo about the way forward for his company and others like
    it, including HuffPost, which he still owns. “The vast majority of people will
    increasingly want social media platforms to provide an escape where they can find
    entertainment, joy, and fun,” Peretti wrote. “This will drive a return to the
    editorially curated news homepage like HuffPost, Drudge, and CNN.com.” Direct
    traffic to sites with strong audiences and reputations would be the future.

- en: And yet, a few weeks later, Jimmy Finkelstein, the former owner of *The Hill*,
    launched a new ad-supported site, The Messenger. The idea was to create an alternative
    to the mainstream national media, which Finkelstein, who is seventy-four, viewed
    as increasingly partisan. “I remember an era where you’d sit by the TV, when I
    was a kid with my family, and we’d all watch ‘60 Minutes’ together,” he [told
    the *Times*](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/10/business/media/the-messenger-jimmy-finkelstein.html).
    “Those days are over, and the fact is, I want to help bring those days back.”
    The site hired hundreds of journalists, and promised to cover sports, politics,
    and entertainment. Executives said that they expected a hundred million monthly
    visitors and to generate a hundred million dollars in a year, mostly through advertising.
    The endeavor lasted less than a year; Finkelstein abruptly dissolved The Messenger
    in January, pulled down the Web site, and left his employees without severance
    or health care. The ordeal demonstrated the media’s poverty of ideas for how to
    survive without robust advertising; the past two years have seen steady drops
    in ad revenue across the industry, even as tech companies somewhat recovered.
    “No one who knew anything would think you can make money off traffic and hit the
    dumbass numbers he put out there,” Jim VandeHei, the co-founder of Axios and Politico,
    told the news site Puck in the aftermath. “I was pissed the moment I heard about
    this dumb idea. It was business malpractice and human cruelty at an epic scale.”

- en: Donald Trump’s Presidency was a boon to some news outlets, particularly the
    *Times* and the Washington *Post*, which were engaged in an arms race to get the
    most explosive scoops. The *Times* gained five million digital subscribers during
    Trump’s four years in office, and the *Post* gained two million. As the President
    railed against the media and levels of trust in the industry plummeted—polls show
    that about two-thirds of the country now has little to no trust in the media—these
    numbers were signs of hope. But the “Trump bump” proved to be a momentary reprieve
    from a sustained and inevitable decline. In 2021, the first year of Joe Biden’s
    Presidency, the *Post*, which is owned by Jeff Bezos, lost about three hundred
    thousand subscribers. The Los Angeles *Times*, which is owned by the billionaire
    Patrick Soon-Shiong, reported an increase in digital subscribers in the summer
    of 2023, but it was about half a million short of Soon-Shiong’s stated goal of
    a million digital subscribers; the paper laid off seventy-four staffers that summer,
    a prelude to this January’s deeper cuts.

    devastating local newsrooms for decades. The *Times* launched its Web site in
    1996, promising “to extend the newspaper’s reach and create new editorial and
    business opportunities in electronic media.” As part of that effort, a “thoughtful,
    unbiased filter”—with “a powerful but user-friendly search function”—would amplify
    its classified offerings nationwide. By then, Craigslist had begun its takeover
    of newspapers’ classifieds revenue; by the mid-two-thousands, newspapers were
    losing money on an Internet where information was increasingly free and ads had
    moved elsewhere. The *Times* lost five hundred and forty-three million dollars
    in 2006\. A couple of years later, the company borrowed some two hundred and twenty-five
    million dollars against its recently completed Times Square building. Only after
    launching a paywall, in 2011, did it find a path back to prosperity. But papers
    serving smaller markets never rebounded: between 2005 and 2024, roughly three
    thousand newspapers in the U.S. have closed. According to the Bureau of Labor
    Statistics, newspapers lost more than forty thousand staffers during the same
    period. Two hundred and four counties in the U.S. now have no local news—high-poverty
    areas are most affected—and, by the end of this year, it’s expected that the U.S.
    will have lost a third of its newspapers. Meanwhile, Craigslist’s founder, Craig
    Newmark, now funds a journalism school that recently announced its intention to
    go tuition-free, a move reminiscent of the explosives manufacturer Alfred Nobel’s
    impulse to fund a peace prize.'

    polarization increases.) But places like the Washington *Post* and the Los Angeles
    *Times* now face similar crises: How does a newspaper make money in 2024? People
    looking to answer that question invariably turn toward the New York *Times*. At

    a robust cooking app, a series of popular games, and the product-review site Wirecutter.
    It is not so much a newspaper as a digital life-style brand. Both the Washington
    *Post* and the Los Angeles *Times* have made efforts to expand their non-news
    offerings—the *Post* beefed up its health section and the L.A. *Times* leaned
    into food coverage and around-the-town entertainment guides. But, even as outlets
    have tried to complement news coverage with other offerings, they’ve faced a fresh
    dilemma: news subscriptions—the great hope of media—are now directly competing
    with entertainment ones. The Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism released
    a report in 2023 that found respondents often weighed their renewal of news subscriptions
    against digital streaming services. “We have Disney+, Hulu, Netflix, Amazon Prime,
    currently HBO Max and Spotify, Kocowa, and BritBox,” one survey respondent said.
    “I used to have The Washington Post but it got too expensive to have all the subscriptions.”
    Another said news was “as important as anything, but if I were to cut one, I would
    first think of cutting my news subscription before any other.”'
