    coupled with an increase in imports, has resulted in the closure of more than
    70,000 factories, Dingell said in the release. The trend has led to the loss of
    jobs and has "hollowed out" entire communities and regions that once thrived on
    the back of manufacturing, hurting the economy and dimming the luster of the American
    dream for many, Dingell said.
