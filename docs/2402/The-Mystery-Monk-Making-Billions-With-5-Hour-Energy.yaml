    office is a cemetery of sorts. It’s a Formica bookcase, its shelves lined with
    hundreds of garishly colored screw-top plastic bottles not much taller than shot
    glasses. Front and center is a Cadillac-red bottle of 5-Hour Energy, the two-ounce
    caffeine and vitamin elixir that purports to keep you alert without crashing.
    In eight years 5-Hour has gone from nowhere to $1 billion in retail sales. Truckers
    swear by it. So do the traders in Oliver Stone’s 2010 sequel to *Wall Street*.
    So do hungover ­students. It’s $3 a bottle, and it has made Bhargava a fortune.

    market, and not because 5-Hour is so delicious. Chalky cough syrup is more like
    it. The reason Bhargava has won is that he plays tough. Sitting in that cemetery
    are a dozen or so neon copycats with names like 6-Hour Power and 8-Hour Energy.
    Each has been sued, bullied or kicked off the market by Living Essentials’ lawyers.
    In front of each are little placards with a skull and crossbones drawn in felt-tip
    pen. Bhargava points at the gravestone of one of his late competitors and says

    at a natural products trade show in Anaheim, Calif. At one booth the sales reps
    peddled a 16-ounce concoction claiming to boost productivity for hours. Bhargava

- en: Right away, though, he knew 16 ounces wouldn’t sell. He didn’t want to compete
    with Red Bull, at the time new to the market. Nor did he want to share fridge
    space with Coke or Pepsi. “I thought, If I’m tired, am I also thirsty? Is that
    like having a headache and a stomachache? It didn’t make any sense.” He glanced
    at the ingredients label and made a mental note. Six months later his version
    was on the shelves, two ounces of ­caffeine-infused B vitamins such as niacin
    mixed with acids like taurine.

    was safe. The initial job of getting 5-Hour Energy on the shelves went to Rise
    Meguiar, Living Essentials’ vice president of sales and the only woman on a team
    of 17\. Health chain GNC was the first to bite, agreeing to stock 5-Hour in 1,200

    little red bottles up at the cash register next to the gum and lighters. “Getting
    it next to the register isn’t hard. Keeping it there? Very hard. Anything that

    were well-off, with a villa surrounded by lush, award-winning gardens. They left
    for America in 1967, so his academic publisher father could get a Ph.D. at Wharton.
    The family landed hard in West Philadelphia in a third-floor, $80-a-month walk-up
    with threadbare carpets on seedy 47th Street. They went from having servants in
    India to splitting one Coca-Cola four ways as a treat.

    raising a hand to mime Matt Damon’s chalkboard scrawl of algebraic equations in

- en: Early on he realized he didn’t much care what sort of business he was in as
    long as he was winning at it. At 17 Bhargava noticed that blocks of low-­income
    homes in the roughest North Philly neighborhoods were being razed and cleared.
    Bhargava bought a 1.5-ton 1953 Chevy dump truck for $400 and started clearing
    out debris from the demolition. He’d find rats bigger than cats among the garbage
    and rubble. “The stench was mind-bending,” he says. He remembers hearing gunshots
    outside a crumbling house on crime-ridden Girard Avenue and learning an old man
    had been killed for $5\. Still, Bhargava made $600 that summer—and resold the
    Chevy for $400\. He didn’t care if the work was unglamorous. It was profitable.

  zh: 早在他意识到，无论从事何种业务，只要能够成功，他都不太在乎。17岁时，Bhargava注意到费城最艰苦的北部贫困社区里的低收入住宅区正在被推倒和清理。Bhargava花了400美元买了一辆1.5吨重的1953年雪佛兰自卸卡车，并开始清理拆迁的废墟。他在垃圾和瓦砾中发现了比猫还大的老鼠。“臭味难以置信，”他说。他记得曾听到在犯罪猖獗的Girard大道上的一座倒塌房屋外传来枪声，并得知一位老人因5美元而被杀。尽管如此，Bhargava那个夏天赚了600美元，并重新以400美元的价格转售了雪佛兰。他并不在乎工作是否不光彩，只要能赚钱就行。
- en: He won a full scholarship to the Ivy League feeder Hill School before heading
    to college at Princeton in 1972\. Bhargava lasted a year. The pretentious eating-club
    culture wasn’t really for him, and he didn’t find his math classes particularly
    challenging. “‘Annoyed’ would be a mild word for my parents’ reaction,” he says.
    He returned to Fort Wayne, Ind., where his parents had settled and his father
    owned a plastics company. “There were no jobs; it was a disaster,” he says. “It
    was right before the oil embargo, the stagflation era.” He started reading books
    about a Hindu saint who’d spent his life on a spiritual quest. That, he thought,
    was something worthwhile. In 1974 he moved to India.

    Wayne，那里他的父母已经定居，他的父亲拥有一家塑料公司。“那里没有工作；简直是一场灾难，”他说。“就在石油禁运之前，滞胀时期。”他开始阅读关于一个在精神追求上度过一生的印度圣人的书籍。他认为，那才是一件值得追求的事情。1974年，他搬到了印度。

    or bells.” It was more like a commune, he says, but without the drugs. He did
    his share of chores, helped run a printing press and worked construction for the
    ashram. Bhargava claims he spent those 12 years trying to master one technique:
    the stilling of the mind, often through meditation. He still considers himself
    a member of the Hanslok order and spends an hour a day in his Farmington Hills
    basement in contemplative silence.'

    Hills的地下室里默默地冥想一个小时。
- en: Bhargava would return to the U.S. periodically during his ashram years, working
    odd jobs before returning to India. For a few months he drove a yellow cab in
    New York. When he moved back from India for good, it was to help with the family
    plastics business at his parents’ urging. He spent the next decade dabbling in
    RV armrests and beachchair parts. He had no interest in plastics whatsoever but
    devoted himself to buying small, struggling regional outfits and turning them
    around. By 2001 Bhargava had expanded his Indiana PVC manufacturer from zero sales
    to $25 million (he eventually sold it to a private equity firm for $20 million
    in 2006). He decided to retire and moved to Michigan to be near his wife’s family.
    “Nobody moves on purpose to Detroit,” he says. His retirement lasted two months.
    He knew from his plastics success that the chemicals industry was ripe for exploiting.
    “Chemicals are really simple,” he says. “You mix a couple things together and
    sell it for more than the materials cost.”

- en: Bhargava takes a shot of his creation every morning and another before his thrice-weekly
    tennis game. He shakes his head at the suggestion that taking shots infused with
    caffeine is at odds with his quest for inner stillness. “5-Hour Energy is not
    an energy drink, it’s a focus drink,” he says, turning one of the pomegranate-flavor
    bottles around in his hands. “But we can’t say that. The FDA doesn’t like the

    paid out in 2010 of just $4 million off a total asset base that by the end of

    this because he set up Rural India as something called a supporting organization,
    or a group that financially supports other charities. Unlike a traditional private
    foundation, a supporting organization has no mandated 5% minimum outlay, pays
    no excise taxes on investment income and has fewer self-dealing restrictions.

  zh: “我说，‘嘿，如果你找到任何技术，带给我。’” Bhargava 说。该基金的第一个投资是在 Hybrid60 上，这是一种液压发动机技术，旨在提高燃油效率达
    60%。LaSorda 目前正在卡车上进行测试，最终希望将这项技术销售给像他的亿万富翁朋友 Roger Penske 这样的客户，后者可能会为他的 22.5
    万租赁卡车进行改装，这是美国最大的车队。
- en: Across the room from their tester Penske truck LaSorda and Bhargava look approvingly
    at their other project: an indoor, software-controlled farm. Tiny basil plants
    are growing inside 12-foot-by-12-foot containers that look like giant tanning
    beds covered in tinfoil. Rows of lilac lights bathe the trays of basil, each pot
    fed the perfect amount of nutrients at the right pH level. It hums like an air-conditioning
    unit, a trickle of water barely audible. In two weeks each sapling will be exactly
    8 inches tall. The hydroponic startup has set up 500 more of these farm fridges,
    which do the work of 500 acres of land, in another unused building Bhargava bought
    on Detroit’s outskirts. He thinks this invention could change agriculture in drought-prone
    Middle Eastern and African countries.

  zh: 在他们的测试 Penske 卡车对面，LaSorda 和 Bhargava 满意地看着他们的另一个项目：一个室内、软件控制的农场。小香草植物在 12 英尺
    x 12 英尺的容器内生长，看起来像是覆盖着锡纸的巨大日光浴床。紫丁香色的灯光照亮香草的托盘，每个盆栽都以正确的 pH 值提供了适量的营养。它像空调一样嗡嗡作响，一丝水声都听不见。两周内，每株幼苗将会长到
    8 英寸高。这家水培初创公司在底特律郊区另一栋未使用的建筑中建立了 500 多个这样的农场冰箱，这相当于 500 英亩土地的工作。他认为这项发明可能会改变干旱频发的中东和非洲国家的农业。
- en: LaSorda says he has found himself having to explain who his mysterious partner
    is on more than one occasion. “The reaction I get is ‘Who’s this guy?’” LaSorda
    says. “Then I say, ‘The 5-Hour Energy guy,’ and they say, ‘Oh, sh--, he must be
    killing it.’ I say, ‘Yeah, he is.’”

  zh: LaSorda 说，他发现自己不得不解释他的神秘伙伴是谁已经不止一次了。“我得到的反应是‘这家伙是谁？’” LaSorda 说。“然后我说，‘5-Hour
    Energy 的那位，’他们说，‘哦，噢，他肯定很成功。’我说，‘是的，他是。’”
