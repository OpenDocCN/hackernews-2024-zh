    office is a cemetery of sorts. It’s a Formica bookcase, its shelves lined with
    hundreds of garishly colored screw-top plastic bottles not much taller than shot
    glasses. Front and center is a Cadillac-red bottle of 5-Hour Energy, the two-ounce
    caffeine and vitamin elixir that purports to keep you alert without crashing.
    In eight years 5-Hour has gone from nowhere to $1 billion in retail sales. Truckers
    swear by it. So do the traders in Oliver Stone’s 2010 sequel to *Wall Street*.
    So do hungover ­students. It’s $3 a bottle, and it has made Bhargava a fortune.

    market, and not because 5-Hour is so delicious. Chalky cough syrup is more like
    it. The reason Bhargava has won is that he plays tough. Sitting in that cemetery
    are a dozen or so neon copycats with names like 6-Hour Power and 8-Hour Energy.
    Each has been sued, bullied or kicked off the market by Living Essentials’ lawyers.
    In front of each are little placards with a skull and crossbones drawn in felt-tip
    pen. Bhargava points at the gravestone of one of his late competitors and says
    with a chuckle, “Rest in peace.”

    a source with knowledge of its financials says the company grossed north of $600
    million last year on that $1 billion at retail. The source says the company netted
    about $300 million. Checkout scan data from research firm SymphonyIRI say that
    5-Hour has 90% of the energy-shot market. Its closest competitor, NVE Pharmaceuticals’
    Stacker brand, has just over 3%.

    His paper trail is thin, consisting primarily of more than 90 lawsuits. This is
    his first press interview. “I’m killing it right now,” he says, adjusting a black
    zip-up cardigan from behind the table of a soulless conference room in a beige
    low-rise building in a suburban business park in Farmington Hills, Mich. “But
    you’ll Google me and find, like, some lawyer in Singapore.”

    of 5-Hour’s parent company, Living Essentials LLC, and that company’s parent firm,
    Innovation Ventures, are purposely bland. “They were intended as placeholders,
    and they stuck,” he says, smiling.

    seems proud of his frugal lifestyle: his ancient flip phone, his cheap office
    furniture, the modest two-story home he shares with his wife and 20-year-old son.
    Yet, over vegetarian lasagna at Antonio’s, his favorite strip-mall Italian joint
    off Detroit’s Twelve-Mile Road, Bhargava says, apropos of nothing: “I’m probably
    the wealthiest Indian in America.”'

    at a natural products trade show in Anaheim, Calif. At one booth the sales reps
    peddled a 16-ounce concoction claiming to boost productivity for hours. Bhargava
    took a swig. “For the next six or seven hours I was in great shape,” he says.
    “I thought, Wow, this is amazing. I can sell this.”

    with Red Bull, at the time new to the market. Nor did he want to share fridge
    space with Coke or Pepsi. “I thought, If I’m tired, am I also thirsty? Is that
    like having a headache and a stomachache? It didn’t make any sense.” He glanced
    at the ingredients label and made a mental note. Six months later his version
    was on the shelves, two ounces of ­caffeine-infused B vitamins such as niacin
    mixed with acids like taurine.

    was safe. The initial job of getting 5-Hour Energy on the shelves went to Rise
    Meguiar, Living Essentials’ vice president of sales and the only woman on a team
    of 17\. Health chain GNC was the first to bite, agreeing to stock 5-Hour in 1,200
    of its stores in 2004\. Slowly but surely, Walgreens, Rite Aid and regional chains
    like Sheetz followed.

    little red bottles up at the cash register next to the gum and lighters. “Getting
    it next to the register isn’t hard. Keeping it there? Very hard. Anything that
    sells, the stores will try. To own that space is really hard.”

    overall sales: the Wal-Mart checkout aisle. The superstore sells all four 5-Hour
    flavors in every U.S. store, plus 24-packs at Sam’s Club.'

    were well-off, with a villa surrounded by lush, award-winning gardens. They left
    for America in 1967, so his academic publisher father could get a Ph.D. at Wharton.
    The family landed hard in West Philadelphia in a third-floor, $80-a-month walk-up
    with threadbare carpets on seedy 47th Street. They went from having servants in
    India to splitting one Coca-Cola four ways as a treat.

    raising a hand to mime Matt Damon’s chalkboard scrawl of algebraic equations in
    the film. “You see stuff or you don’t. I just see it.” He had no tuition money,
    but connived his way into interviews at competitive Philadelphia schools, offering
    to take math tests to prove himself.

- en: Early on he realized he didn’t much care what sort of business he was in as
    long as he was winning at it. At 17 Bhargava noticed that blocks of low-­income
    homes in the roughest North Philly neighborhoods were being razed and cleared.
    Bhargava bought a 1.5-ton 1953 Chevy dump truck for $400 and started clearing
    out debris from the demolition. He’d find rats bigger than cats among the garbage
    and rubble. “The stench was mind-bending,” he says. He remembers hearing gunshots
    outside a crumbling house on crime-ridden Girard Avenue and learning an old man
    had been killed for $5\. Still, Bhargava made $600 that summer—and resold the
    Chevy for $400\. He didn’t care if the work was unglamorous. It was profitable.

    to college at Princeton in 1972\. Bhargava lasted a year. The pretentious eating-club
    culture wasn’t really for him, and he didn’t find his math classes particularly
    challenging. “‘Annoyed’ would be a mild word for my parents’ reaction,” he says.
    He returned to Fort Wayne, Ind., where his parents had settled and his father
    owned a plastics company. “There were no jobs; it was a disaster,” he says. “It
    was right before the oil embargo, the stagflation era.” He started reading books
    about a Hindu saint who’d spent his life on a spiritual quest. That, he thought,
    was something worthwhile. In 1974 he moved to India.

    by an ashram called Hanslok. He and his fellow disciples weren’t monks, exactly.
    “It’s the closest Western word,” he says. “We didn’t have bowler haircuts or robes
    or bells.” It was more like a commune, he says, but without the drugs. He did
    his share of chores, helped run a printing press and worked construction for the
    ashram. Bhargava claims he spent those 12 years trying to master one technique:
    the stilling of the mind, often through meditation. He still considers himself
    a member of the Hanslok order and spends an hour a day in his Farmington Hills
    basement in contemplative silence.'

    odd jobs before returning to India. For a few months he drove a yellow cab in
    New York. When he moved back from India for good, it was to help with the family
    plastics business at his parents’ urging. He spent the next decade dabbling in
    RV armrests and beachchair parts. He had no interest in plastics whatsoever but
    devoted himself to buying small, struggling regional outfits and turning them
    around. By 2001 Bhargava had expanded his Indiana PVC manufacturer from zero sales
    to $25 million (he eventually sold it to a private equity firm for $20 million
    in 2006). He decided to retire and moved to Michigan to be near his wife’s family.
    “Nobody moves on purpose to Detroit,” he says. His retirement lasted two months.
    He knew from his plastics success that the chemicals industry was ripe for exploiting.
    “Chemicals are really simple,” he says. “You mix a couple things together and
    sell it for more than the materials cost.”

    tennis game. He shakes his head at the suggestion that taking shots infused with
    caffeine is at odds with his quest for inner stillness. “5-Hour Energy is not
    an energy drink, it’s a focus drink,” he says, turning one of the pomegranate-flavor
    bottles around in his hands. “But we can’t say that. The FDA doesn’t like the
    word ‘focus.’ I have no idea why.”

    belongs to Silicon Valley venture capitalist Vinod Khosla—but trying to untangle
    Bhargava’s business structure requires a 24-pack of 5-Hour Extra Strength. He
    could well be worth much more than Khosla’s $1.3 billion. Living Essentials’ closest
    comparable public company, energy drink giant Monster, trades at over 30 times
    earnings, making Bhargava easily a multibillionaire on paper.

    FORBES from his attorney, David Lieberman of the Michigan firm Seyburn Kahn, to
    back him up. Tax returns of Bhargava’s U.S. charity, the Rural India Supporting
    Trust, suggest a different narrative. Virtually the entire donation was in the
    form of a 45% stake in the privately held Living Essentials. Only a few million
    dollars was in cash.

    In exchange, Rural India got a note worth $623.6 million. Bhargava’s accountant
    Paul Edwards of Plante Moran says his client is not a beneficial owner in Nevada
    5—but another one of his associates says it is a vehicle for Bhargava’s philanthropy
    and affiliated with Innovation Ventures, the parent company of Living Essentials.

    University’s Columbus School of Law and an expert on tax and philanthropy. “If
    it were a private foundation, it would be prohibited from selling to a company

    paid out in 2010 of just $4 million off a total asset base that by the end of
    that year had been stepped up to just over $1 billion. Bhargava can get away with
    this because he set up Rural India as something called a supporting organization,
    or a group that financially supports other charities. Unlike a traditional private
    foundation, a supporting organization has no mandated 5% minimum outlay, pays
    no excise taxes on investment income and has fewer self-dealing restrictions.
    Bhargava is not doing anything illegal here, just exploiting a loophole in the
    tax code many other big philanthropists have used as well.

    2002\. “This structure permits a donor to donate assets to a charity, which then
    lends them back to the donor,” Grassley says. “This results in huge tax breaks
    for the donor with very little money actually going to those in need.”

    organization called the Hans Foundation, which works to improve the lives of India’s
    most needy. Hans sends surgeons to combat epidemic levels of cataracts among the
    rural poor and devotes much-needed funds to women’s health care. A staff of 12
    travels India looking for schools and hospitals to adopt rather than build from
    scratch. “We don’t do the work, but we have money,” Bhargava says.

- en: Bhargava was originally vague and slightly taciturn when asked about the name
    of the foundation, describing Hans only as a former teacher, now dead. Only later,
    after much questioning, did he identify Hans as a guru called Shri Hans Ji Maharaj,
    spiritual leader of the Hanslok ashram where Bhargava spent those years pursuing
    a life of discipline as a monk. Bhargava talks of his monk days nonchalantly,
    accompanied by a characteristic dismissive shrug. “It’s a personal thing,” he
    says. “I don’t want to be a Jehovah’s Witness here proselytizing.”

    He’s put most of the $100 million behind Stage 2 Innovations, a Detroit tech venture
    fund that’s already invested in clean engines, hydroponic farming and water desalination.
    To run Stage 2 Bhargava hired former Chrysler Group CEO Tom LaSorda, a barrel-chested
    auto industry veteran as gregarious as the slight, bespectacled Bhargava is reticent.
    Bhargava wooed LaSorda over a $12 plate of pasta under the dusty grapes hanging
    from the ceiling at Antonio’s.

- en: “I said, ‘Hey, if you find any technology, bring it to me,’” says Bhargava.
    The fund’s first investment is in Hybrid60, a hydraulic engine technology that
    aims to increase fuel efficiency by 60%. LaSorda is testing it on trucks right
    now and eventually hopes to sell the technology to customers such as his billionaire
    buddy Roger Penske, who could retrofit his 225,000 rental trucks, the largest
    fleet in the U.S.

- en: Across the room from their tester Penske truck LaSorda and Bhargava look approvingly
    at their other project: an indoor, software-controlled farm. Tiny basil plants
    are growing inside 12-foot-by-12-foot containers that look like giant tanning
    beds covered in tinfoil. Rows of lilac lights bathe the trays of basil, each pot
    fed the perfect amount of nutrients at the right pH level. It hums like an air-conditioning
    unit, a trickle of water barely audible. In two weeks each sapling will be exactly
    8 inches tall. The hydroponic startup has set up 500 more of these farm fridges,
    which do the work of 500 acres of land, in another unused building Bhargava bought
    on Detroit’s outskirts. He thinks this invention could change agriculture in drought-prone
    Middle Eastern and African countries.

    killing it.’ I say, ‘Yeah, he is.’”
