- en: The Global Oil and Gas Exploration and Production industry has gone through
    major turbulence over the five years to 2023\. The COVID-19 pandemic and accompanying
    socioeconomic restrictions significantly disrupted macroeconomic activity, leading
    to tremendous volatility within global energy markets. Industry revenue fell to
    multi-decade lows in 2020 before reaching all-time highs in 2022 as production
    and prices of hydrocarbons were completely unstable. Industry revenue has increased
    at a CAGR of 9.6% to $5.3 trillion over the five years to 2023, despite a decline
    of 19.8% in 2023 alone. During this time, the United States has emerged as a key

- en: The industry has decreased over the five years to 2023 despite the growth of
    global demand for insurance products. The industry provides essential risk management
    services to downstream consumers and is a vital part of the financial sector,
    particularly concerning the industry's massive asset holdings. Industry operators
    protect individuals from current, immediate and long-term illness, injury and
    death costs. By merging various risks, life and health insurers protect a fraction
    of the potential loss. The role of life and health insurers has become increasingly
    important as the global population has aged. Although the industry provides essential

    plans, have been the primary means for meeting the retirement requirements of
    an aging global population. Industry revenue consists of contributions, investment
    income, net sales of securities and more. Positive investment returns from equities
    have driven the growth of revenue despite volatility in financial markets. Global
    pension funds revenue has been increasing at a CAGR of 1.3% over the past five
    years, including an estimated 2.7% in 2023 alone, and is expected to total $4.3

    Specifically, investor confidence slightly declined over the same period as COVID-19
    severely constricted demand. As a result, industry revenue is expected to slightly
    decline an annualized 2.5% to $4.3 trillion over the five years to 2023, including
    an anticipated increase of 1.6% in 2023 as the economy recovers from the coronavirus

    two of the world's largest car dealers, these geographies grappled with diminishing
    car sales, overshadowing solid growth achieved in emerging economies. Supply chain
    disruptions following COVID-19 stalled new car production, driving up car prices
    in 2021 and 2022\. Dealers benefited from a surge in used car demand as new vehicle
    prices became prohibitive for many consumers, supporting a global recovery in

    the past five years, with issues such as a soft insurance market, low interest
    rates and numerous catastrophes affecting all operators in major markets. However,
    the rapid growth of emerging markets has slightly offset stagnating mature markets.
    An expanding middle class in countries like China has increased demand for insurance,
    driving industry growth. Therefore, global direct general insurance carrier revenue
    is expected to fall at a CAGR of 1.1% over the past five years – including an

    and government spending on passenger vehicles amid stable macroeconomic growth
    and historically low interest rates before the pandemic. Significant technological
    improvements, particularly regarding hybrid and electric vehicles, internal combustion
    engine fuel efficiency, infotainment development and autonomous driving capabilities,
    have also spurred global demand from the growing middle class. Even so, the pandemic
    led to a monumental slowdown, slashing vehicle demand. As a result, automaker
    revenue contracted at an expected CAGR of 2.3% to $2.6 trillion through the current
    period, despite a 1.6% jump in 2023 as the economy heats up.

    and India, with these countries expected to retain their positions for the foreseeable
    future. Global coal mining revenue is a function of global production of coal
    mined products alongside global coal prices, with prices being closely tied to
