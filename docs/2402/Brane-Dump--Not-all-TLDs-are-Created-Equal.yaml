- en: In light of the recent [cancellation of the `queer.af` domain registration by
    the Taliban](https://akko.erincandescent.net/notice/AenvYJ0yiHfspKM8uW), the fragile
    and difficult nature of country-code top-level domains (ccTLDs) has once again
    been comprehensively demonstrated. Since many people may not be aware of the risks,
    I thought I’d give a solid explainer of the whole situation, and explain why you
    should, in general, not have anything to do with domains which are registered
    under ccTLDs.

- en: A top-level domain (TLD) is the last part of a domain name (the collection of
    words, separated by periods, after the `https://` in your web browser’s location
    bar). It’s the “com” in `example.com`, or the “af” in `queer.af`.

    under: old-school technobabble like “com”, “net”, or “org”, historical oddities
    like “gov”, and the new-fangled world of words like “tech”, “social”, and “bank”.
    These gTLDs are all regulated under a set of rules created and administered by
    ICANN (the “Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers”), which try to
    ensure that things aren’t a complete wild-west, limiting things like price hikes
    (well, sometimes, anyway), and providing means for disputes over names^.'

- en: Country-code TLDs, in contrast, are all two letters long^(, and are given out
    to countries to do with as they please. While ICANN kinda-sorta has something
    to do with ccTLDs (in the sense that it makes them exist on the Internet), it
    has no authority to control how a ccTLD is managed. If a country decides to raise
    prices by 100x, or cancel all registrations that were made on the 12th of the
    month, there’s nothing anyone can do about it.)

    – the Taliban deciding to asssert its bigotry over the little corner of the Internet
    namespace it has taken control of is far from the first time that ccTLDs have
    caused grief.

    reportedly registered, 2018, Afghanistan had what one might describe as, at least,
    a *different* political climate. Since then, of course, things have changed, and
    the new bosses have decided to get a bit more active.

    planning on moving to another, less fraught, domain, but hadn’t completed that
    move when the Taliban came knocking.

    the EU’s rules for the registration of domains under the “eu” ccTLD^(. To register
    (and maintain) a domain name ending in `.eu`, you have to be a resident of the
    EU. When the UK ceased to be part of the EU, residents of the UK were no longer
    EU residents.)

    to Britons. Some decided to give up their domains, and move to other parts of
    the Internet, while others managed to hold onto them by various legal sleight-of-hand
    (like having an EU company maintain the registration on their behalf).

    [asked ICANN to suspend ccTLDs associated with Russia](https://eump.org/media/2022/Goran-Marby.pdf).
    While ICANN said that it wasn’t going to do that, because it wouldn’t do anything
    useful, some domain registrars (the companies you pay to register domain names)
    ceased to deal in Russian ccTLDs, and some websites restricted links to domains
    with Russian ccTLDs.

- en: Whether or not you agree with the sort of activism implied by these actions,
    the fact remains that even the actions of a government that *aren’t* directly
    related to the Internet can have grave consequences for your domain name if it’s
    registered under a ccTLD. I don’t *think* any gTLD operator will be invading a
    neighbouring country any time soon.

- en: When you register a domain name, you pay a registration fee to a registrar,
    who does administrative gubbins and causes you to be able to control the domain
    name in the DNS. However, you don’t “own” that domain name ^(– you’re only *renting*
    it. When the registration period comes to an end, you have to renew the domain
    name, or you’ll cease to be able to control it.)
  prefs: []

- en: Given that a domain name is typically your “brand” or “identity” online, the
    chances are you’d prefer to keep it over time, because moving to a new domain
    name is a *massive* pain, having to tell all your customers or users that now
    you’re somewhere else, plus having to accept the risk of someone registering the
    domain name you used to have and capturing your traffic… it’s all a gigantic hassle.

- en: For gTLDs, ICANN has various rules around price increases and bait-and-switch
    pricing that tries to keep a lid on the worst excesses of registries. While there
    are any number of reasonable criticisms of the rules, and the Internet community
    has to stay on their toes to keep ICANN from [totally succumbing to regulatory
    capture](https://domainnamewire.com/2019/03/18/icann-proposes-lifting-price-controls-on-org-info-domains/),
    at least in the gTLD space there’s some degree of control over price gouging.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: On the other hand, ccTLDs have no effective controls over their pricing. For
    example, in 2008 the Seychelles increased the price of `.sc` domain names from
    [US$25](https://web.archive.org/web/20071113061947/http://www.afilias-grs.info:80/public/policies/sc)
    to [US$75](https://web.archive.org/web/20080308114828/http://www.afilias-grs.info:80/public/policies/sc).
    No reason, no warning, just “pay up”.

    While Libya was being run by a [terrorist-supporting extremist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muammar_Gaddafi),
    companies thought it was a great idea to have domain names that ended in `.ly`.
    These domain registrations weren’t (and aren’t) cheap, and it’s hard to imagine
    that at least some of that money wasn’t going to benefit the Gaddafi regime.

    created in a [colonialist piece of chicanery that expelled thousands of native
    Chagossians from Diego Garcia](https://theconversation.com/how-the-us-and-uk-worked-together-to-recolonise-the-chagos-islands-and-evict-chagossians-177636).
    Money from the registration of `.io` domains doesn’t go to the (former) residents
    of the Chagos islands, instead [it gets paid to the UK government](https://web.archive.org/web/20200314085443/gigaom.com/2014/06/30/the-dark-side-of-io-how-the-u-k-is-making-web-domain-profits-from-a-shady-cold-war-land-deal/).

    it’s a good idea to register a domain under a ccTLD for “vanity” purposes: because
    it makes a word, is the same as a file extension you like, or because it looks
    cool.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Those ccTLDs that clearly represent and are associated with a particular country
    are more likely to be OK, because there is less impetus for the registry to try
    a naked cash grab. Unfortunately, ccTLD registries have a disconcerting habit
    of changing their minds on whether they serve their geographic locality, such
    as when auDA decided to declare an open season in the `.au` namespace some years
    ago. Essentially, while a ccTLD may have geographic connotations *now*, there’s
    not a lot of guarantee that they won’t fall victim to scope creep in the future.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Finally, it *might* be somewhat safer to register under a ccTLD if you live
    in the location involved. At least then you might have a better idea of whether
    your domain is likely to get pulled out from underneath you. Unfortunately, as
    the `.eu` example shows, living somewhere today is no guarantee you’ll still be
    living there tomorrow, even if you don’t move house.

    ccTLDs.
