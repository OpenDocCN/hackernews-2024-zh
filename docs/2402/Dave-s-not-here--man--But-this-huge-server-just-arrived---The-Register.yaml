    contemplate a drink or two. So to give you something to talk about should you
    visit a pub in search of such libations we therefore present a fresh instalment
    of On Call, the column in which you share your stories of tech support jobs that
    left you a little worse for wear.

    house that developed a vertical industry application, and had an interesting sideline
    in disaster recovery.

    servers and repair and replace broken equipment," Neil explained.'

    they needed a new server it could be configured with very recent data.

    time for mucking around.

    relaxed chap who often exuded a strong … let's say herbal aroma, to handle packaging
    and despatch for servers.

- en: Neil later learned that the new hire was the wastrel nephew of a company director,
    who had arranged a job out of sympathy and issued dire warnings about last chances,
    disinheritance, and other terrible consequences if he didn't clean himself up
    and sort out his life.

    the influence of jazz cabbage, he did a decent job.

    and powerful server on a Friday, for delivery first thing Monday, the team pulled
    together and the wastrel nephew ensured timely despatch before quitting time.

    a big job in a rush.

    missed calls from the customer wanting to know where his new server could be found."

    A few clicks on a shipment tracking service revealed that the server was in …
    a residential complex. And not a nice one either.

    locale.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    of debts, and that he'd only taken the job to await an opportunity to misdirect
    a high-value shipment.

    "That was twenty years ago, and I still find it funny so feel free to Regomize
    it."'
