    house that developed a vertical industry application, and had an interesting sideline
    in disaster recovery.

    servers and repair and replace broken equipment," Neil explained.'

    they needed a new server it could be configured with very recent data.

    relaxed chap who often exuded a strong … let's say herbal aroma, to handle packaging
    and despatch for servers.

    who had arranged a job out of sympathy and issued dire warnings about last chances,
    disinheritance, and other terrible consequences if he didn't clean himself up
    and sort out his life.

    and powerful server on a Friday, for delivery first thing Monday, the team pulled
    together and the wastrel nephew ensured timely despatch before quitting time.

    A few clicks on a shipment tracking service revealed that the server was in …
    a residential complex. And not a nice one either.
