- en: The horror of it dawned on Dmitry Rybolovlev in paradise, of all places. Over
    lunch in St Barts in 2014, conversation turned to a painting by Amedeo Modigliani,
    an Italian artist, that the Russian billionaire had bought several years before
    in a private sale. At the table happened to be an art adviser for the previous
    owner, who revealed Mr Rybolovlev paid around $25m more than what the seller had
    made.

- en: It turned out that a Swiss middleman named Yves Bouvier, whom Mr Rybolovlev
    thought was acting as his adviser, pocketed the difference, plus an agreed-upon
    commission. The staggering markup fit a pattern. Over 38 sales Mr Bouvier allegedly
    made more than $1bn. On many occasions Mr Rybolovlev says he was told falsely
    that Mr Bouvier was haggling with the sellers to get better prices, only to inflate
    them.
