    since the Detroit-based union hit the 30% milestone at the plant in Vance, Alabama,
    outside Tuscaloosa. Securing a majority of the autoworkers' backing means the
    union will hold a rally to drum up further support. Once 70% of workers at a plant
    sign authorization cards, the UAW would demand the company recognize its representation,
    or else pursue a National Labor Relations Board election.

    gains such as the return of pensions from the Detroit Three automakers, UAW President
    Shawn Fain has said. The union hasn't hit the 70% mark at any transplant location

    after securing record national contracts last year with the Detroit Three. The
    Mercedes plant is the second to hit the 50% threshold after workers at Volkswagen
    AG's plant in Chattanooga, Tennessee, did so earlier this month.

    right way. But here’s the thing. This is our decision. It’s our life. It’s our
