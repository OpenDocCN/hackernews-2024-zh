    Jason Citron, Linda Yaccarino and Shou Chew spent nearly four hours being grilled
    by lawmakers about their records on child safety.

  zh: Meta、Snap、Discord、X 和 TikTok 的首席执行官在一场关乎在线儿童剥削的高风险参议院司法委员会听证会上作证。在听证会期间，马克·扎克伯格、埃文·斯皮格尔、杰森·西特伦、琳达·雅卡里诺和守秋等人接受了近四个小时的议员们就他们在儿童安全方面的记录进行的质询。
- en: The hearing was the first time Spiegel, Citron and Yaccarino testified to Congress.
    Notably, all three were subpoenaed by the committee after [refusing](https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/press/releases/durbin-graham-announce-january-2024-hearing-with-five-big-tech-ceos-on-their-failure-to-protect-children-online)
    to appear voluntarily, according to lawmakers. Judiciary Committee Chair Senator
    Dick Durbin noted that Citron “only accepted services of his subpoena after US
    Marshals were sent to Discord’s headquarters at taxpayers’ expense.”

- en: The hearing room was filled with parents of children who had been victims of
    online exploitation on social media. Many members of the audience silently held
    up photos of their children as the CEOs entered the room, and Durbin kicked off
    the hearing with a somber video featuring victims of child exploitation and their
    parents.

- en: “Discord has been used to groom, abduct and abuse children,” Durbin said. “Meta’s
    Instagram helped connect and promote a network of pedophiles. Snapchat’s disappearing
    messages have been co-opted by criminals who financially extort young victims.
    TikTok has become a quote platform of choice for predators to access, engage and
    groom children for abuse. And the prevalence of CSAM on X has grown as the company
    has gutted its trust and safety workforce.”

    已经成为虐待儿童的“首选平台”。而随着公司削减了其信任和安全工作人员，X 上的CSAM的普及率也在增长。”
- en: During the hearing, many of the senators shared personal stories of parents
    whose children had died by suicide after being exploited online. "Mr. Zuckerberg,
    you and the companies before us — I know you don't mean it to be so — but you
    have blood on your hands," Senator Lindsey Graham said in his opening remarks.

    — 但你们手上沾满了鲜血。”观众鼓掌。
- en: While years of similar hearings have so far failed to produce any new laws,
    there is growing bipartisan support in Congress for new safety regulations. As
    *Tech Policy Press* [points out,](https://www.techpolicy.press/backgrounder-senate-judiciary-committee-child-safety/)
    there are currently more than half a dozen bills dealing with children's online
    safety that have been proposed by senators. These include the [Kids Online Safety
    Act (KOSA)](https://www.engadget.com/bipartisan-senate-group-reintroduces-a-revised-kids-online-safety-act-212117992.html),
    which would require platforms to create more parental control and safety features
    and submit to independent audits, and [COPPA 2.0](https://www.engadget.com/senators-reintroduce-coppa-20-bill-to-tighten-child-safety-online-165043087.html),
    a revised version of the 1998 Children and Teens' Online Privacy Protection Act,
    which would bar companies from collecting or monetizing children’s data without
    consent.

    目前有超过半打涉及儿童在线安全的法案由参议员提出。这些包括[儿童在线安全法案（KOSA）](https://www.engadget.com/bipartisan-senate-group-reintroduces-a-revised-kids-online-safety-act-212117992.html)，该法案要求平台创建更多的家长控制和安全功能，并接受独立审计，以及[COPPA
    2.0](https://www.engadget.com/senators-reintroduce-coppa-20-bill-to-tighten-child-safety-online-165043087.html)，这是1998年《儿童和青少年在线隐私保护法》的修订版本，将禁止公司在没有同意的情况下收集或变现儿童数据。
- en: Senators have also proposed a number of bills to address child exploitation,
    including the EARN IT Act, currently in its [third iteration](https://www.engadget.com/the-earn-it-act-will-be-introduced-to-congress-for-the-third-time-192619083.html)
    since 2020, and the STOP CSAM Act. None of these have advanced to the Senate floor
    for a vote. Many of these bills have faced intense lobbying from the tech industry,
    though some companies in attendance said they were open to some bills and some
    aspects of the legislation.

    CSAM法案。这些法案都没有被推进到参议院进行投票。许多法案都面临来自科技行业的强烈游说，尽管一些出席会议的公司表示他们对某些法案和法律的一些方面持开放态度。

- en: Zuckerberg suggested a different approach, saying he supported age verification
    and parental control requirements at the app store level, which would effectively
    shift the burden to Apple and Google. "Apple already requires parental consent
    when a child does a payment with an app, so it should be pretty trivial to pass
    a law that requires them to make it so parents have control anytime a child downloads
    an app,” Zuckerberg said.

  zh: Zuckerberg提出了一种不同的方法，表示支持在应用商店层面实施年龄验证和家长控制要求，这将有效地将责任转移给Apple和Google。“Apple已经要求在孩子使用应用进行支付时需要父母同意，因此制定法律要求他们让父母随时控制孩子下载应用是非常简单的事情，”Zuckerberg说道。
