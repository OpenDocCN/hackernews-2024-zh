- en: The CEOs of Meta, Snap, Discord, X and TikTok testified at a high-stakes Senate
    Judiciary Committee [hearing](https://www.engadget.com/how-to-watch-the-ceos-of-meta-tiktok-discord-snap-and-x-testify-about-child-safety-214210385.html)
    on child exploitation online. During the hearing, Mark Zuckerberg, Evan Spiegel,
    Jason Citron, Linda Yaccarino and Shou Chew spent nearly four hours being grilled
    by lawmakers about their records on child safety.

    Notably, all three were subpoenaed by the committee after [refusing](https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/press/releases/durbin-graham-announce-january-2024-hearing-with-five-big-tech-ceos-on-their-failure-to-protect-children-online)
    to appear voluntarily, according to lawmakers. Judiciary Committee Chair Senator
    Dick Durbin noted that Citron “only accepted services of his subpoena after US
    Marshals were sent to Discord’s headquarters at taxpayers’ expense.”

    online exploitation on social media. Many members of the audience silently held
    up photos of their children as the CEOs entered the room, and Durbin kicked off
    the hearing with a somber video featuring victims of child exploitation and their
    parents.

    Instagram helped connect and promote a network of pedophiles. Snapchat’s disappearing
    messages have been co-opted by criminals who financially extort young victims.
    TikTok has become a quote platform of choice for predators to access, engage and
    groom children for abuse. And the prevalence of CSAM on X has grown as the company
    has gutted its trust and safety workforce.”

    whose children had died by suicide after being exploited online. "Mr. Zuckerberg,
    you and the companies before us — I know you don't mean it to be so — but you
    have blood on your hands," Senator Lindsey Graham said in his opening remarks.
    The audience applauded.

- en: While years of similar hearings have so far failed to produce any new laws,
    there is growing bipartisan support in Congress for new safety regulations. As
    *Tech Policy Press* [points out,](https://www.techpolicy.press/backgrounder-senate-judiciary-committee-child-safety/)
    there are currently more than half a dozen bills dealing with children's online
    safety that have been proposed by senators. These include the [Kids Online Safety
    Act (KOSA)](https://www.engadget.com/bipartisan-senate-group-reintroduces-a-revised-kids-online-safety-act-212117992.html),
    which would require platforms to create more parental control and safety features
    and submit to independent audits, and [COPPA 2.0](https://www.engadget.com/senators-reintroduce-coppa-20-bill-to-tighten-child-safety-online-165043087.html),
    a revised version of the 1998 Children and Teens' Online Privacy Protection Act,
    which would bar companies from collecting or monetizing children’s data without
    consent.

    including the EARN IT Act, currently in its [third iteration](https://www.engadget.com/the-earn-it-act-will-be-introduced-to-congress-for-the-third-time-192619083.html)
    since 2020, and the STOP CSAM Act. None of these have advanced to the Senate floor
    for a vote. Many of these bills have faced intense lobbying from the tech industry,
    though some companies in attendance said they were open to some bills and some
    aspects of the legislation.

    Act. Shou and Citron both declined to specifically endorse the bills they were
    asked about, but said they were open to more discussions.

    and parental control requirements at the app store level, which would effectively
    shift the burden to Apple and Google. "Apple already requires parental consent
    when a child does a payment with an app, so it should be pretty trivial to pass
    a law that requires them to make it so parents have control anytime a child downloads
    an app,” Zuckerberg said.

    In one awkward exchange, Senator Graham asked Zuckerberg if the parents of a child
    who died by suicide after falling victim to a sextortion scheme should be able
    to sue Meta. Zuckerberg, looking uncomfortable, paused and said “I think that
    they can sue us.”

    apologize to the parents in the hearing room. Zuckerberg stood up and faced the
    audience. "I’m sorry for everything you have all been through," he said. "No one
    should go through the things that your families have suffered and this is why
    we invest so much and we are going to continue doing industry-wide efforts to
    make sure no one has to go through the things your families have had to suffer."

    Multiple senators pressed Chew on TikTok’s relationship with China, as well as
    its handling of content moderation during the Israel-Hamas war. Senator Tom Cotton
    repeatedly asked TikTok's CEO about [his citizenship](https://twitter.com/therecount/status/1752752690965147802)
    (Chew is Singaporean).

    else is just cottage cheese,” Kennedy asked.

    in the lead-up to the hearing). Yaccarino, who repeatedly claimed that X was a
    “brand new company” said X was considering adding parental controls. “Being a
    14-month-old company we have reprioritized child protection and safety measures,”
    she said. “And we have just begun to talk about and discuss how we can enhance
    those with parental controls.”
