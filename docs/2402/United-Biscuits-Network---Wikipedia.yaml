- en: In 1970 the [BBC](/wiki/BBC "BBC") had a monopoly on radio broadcasting in Britain,
    although there were a few offshore [pirate radio](/wiki/Pirate_radio "Pirate radio")
    broadcasters, such as [Radio Caroline](/wiki/Radio_Caroline "Radio Caroline").^([[2]](#cite_note-morris-2))
    At one time factories had sought to avoid unnecessary background sound, but during
    the [Second World War](/wiki/Second_World_War "Second World War") psychologists
    found that light background music ([muzak](/wiki/Muzak "Muzak")) increased productivity
    at times it was low, a trend that continued after the war. But as jobs became
    deskilled and ever more monotonous, muzak became less effective, and staff turnover
    increased. United Biscuits was affected by this trend; [Hector Laing](/wiki/Hector_Laing
    "Hector Laing"), the managing director in the 1960s, needed to reduce the costs
    of high staff turnover. Inspired by the success of the pirate stations, Laing
    hired suitable staff, bought state-of-the-art broadcasting equipment, and set
    up UBN at UB headquarters in [Osterley](/wiki/Osterley "Osterley"), west London
    (later the headquarters of broadcaster [Sky UK](/wiki/Sky_UK "Sky UK")).

    was via [GPO](/wiki/General_Post_Office "General Post Office") landlines, then
    100 V loudspeaker systems in each factory. Each pair of workers had their own
    loudspeaker and volume control. To accommodate the already high [ambient noise
    levels](/wiki/Ambient_noise_level "Ambient noise level") in the factories, the
    audio was highly compressed.

- en: 'As the UBN was the only independent "broadcaster", operated 24 hours a day,
    and had high quality equipment and musical sources, it was an excellent opportunity
    for entertainers to rise from small-scale [DJ](/wiki/DJ "DJ")-ing to radio broadcasting;
    the network was music-oriented, and hosts were allowed a free rein, within reason.
    Graham Dene, who became a well-known presenter after UBN, was on air on the opening
    day, 1 September 1970, and later said he "could not believe his luck": "It was
    like a radio university. We had the best kit, the proper studios. We even had
    jingles re-recorded from the pirate ship Radio London. It was like seventh heaven:
    a proper station of our own." Someone who joined at the start was told that if
    UBN could reduce UB staff turnover by 20%, it would pay for itself; within the
    first year, turnover dropped by 40%.^([[2]](#cite_note-morris-2))'

    it trained in broadcasting were available to man the new independent broadcasters.
    Andrew Ellinas, who broadcast on UBN's last hour on 16 December 1979, said "UBN
    was the beginning of the golden age of radio. Its legacy lies in every commercial
    station in the UK."^([[2]](#cite_note-morris-2))
