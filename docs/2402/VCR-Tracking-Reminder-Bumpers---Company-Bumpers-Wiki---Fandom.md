# VCR Tracking Reminder Bumpers | Company Bumpers Wiki | Fandom

> 来源：[https://company-bumpers.fandom.com/wiki/VCR_Tracking_Reminder_Bumpers](https://company-bumpers.fandom.com/wiki/VCR_Tracking_Reminder_Bumpers)

**Background**: Many home video companies placed these bumpers at the beginning of their VHS tapes to remind the viewer about adjusting the tracking feature on their VCR for the best quality. When auto-tracking became the standard in the late 90's, these bumpers ceased to be used.

## Strand VCI Entertainment[]

### 1988–1993[]

**Bumper**: On a black background, the screen reads "**For best picture quality, please adjust the tracking control on your VCR.**" in a white Helvetica font.

**Variant**: On some releases such as *The Mouse and the Motorcycle*, the text was rearranged into four paragraphs instead of three, and the screen cuts in and out.

**FX/SFX**: None.

**Music/Sounds**: None.

**Availability**: Seen on Strand VCI Entertainment VHS releases such as *Thomas Gets Tricked*, *James Learns a Lesson*, *Tenders and Turntables* and *Thomas Breaks the Rules* (all in EP Mode). It was also seen on a 1994 JTC Home Video VHS of *Field Dressing Your Deer*, and makes a surprise appearance on an EP reprint of the VidAmerica VHS of *Battle Hell*. It also appeared on the 1990 StarMaker VHS of *Chiefs*.

## GoodTimes Home Video[]

### 1984–1989[]

**Bumper**: On a black background, there is white text in a blocky font reading: "**FOR BEST PICTURE QUALITY ADJUST TRACKING CONTROL**" or "**FOR BEST QUALITY PICTURE ADJUST TRACKING CONTROL**".

**FX/SFX**: None.

**Music/Sounds**: None.

**Availability**: Uncommon. Seen on some GoodTimes and Kids Klassics VHS releases of the time. Also seen on some MCA(/Universal) Home Video VHS tapes distributed by GoodTimes.

## Turner Home Entertainment/GoodTimes Home Video/Orion Home Video/Cabin Fever Entertainment[]

### 1987–1992[]

**Bumper**: On a black/gray gradient background, we see white text reading "**This video is recorded in E.P. mode. For best picture quality please adjust your tracking.**"

**FX/SFX**: None.

**Music/Sounds**: None.

**Availability**: Used on early Turner Home Entertainment VHS releases and some by GoodTimes Home Video, Orion Home Video, and Cabin Fever Entertainment (such as *Lonesome Dove*).

### 1992-1996[]

**Bumper**: On a black background, the same text as on the previous bumper fades in, one line at a time.

**FX/SFX**: The fading.

**Music/Sounds**: None.

**Availability**: Extremely rare. This was found on a VHS of *Scooby's All-Star Laff-a-Lympics: On Your Marks, Get Set — Go Scoobys!*.

## Orion Home Video (standalone)[]

### 1987-89[]

**Bumper**: On a plain blue background is the words "ADJUST TRACKING CONTROL FOR BEST PICTURE QUALITY".

**FX/SFX**: None.

**Music/Sounds**: None.

**Availability**: Rare. Seen on certain Orion Home Video releases from the era such as *Married to the Mob*.

### 1989-98[]

**Bumper**: On a blue BG with the Orion Home Video wallpaper, we see the words "**This video is recorded in the EP mode. For best picture quality, adjust the tracking on your VCR.**"

**FX/SFX**: None.

**Music/Sounds**: None.

**Availability**: More common than the above bumper and can be seen on Orion VHS releases from the era such as *Mac and Me*.

## Feature Films for Families[]

### 1986–2006[]

**Bumper**: On a black background, the screen reads "**If the picture on your screen is not clear, please adjust the tracking on your VCR****.**" in a white Arial font.

**FX/SFX**: None.

**Music/Sounds**: None.

**Availability**: Seen on certain Feature Films for Families VHS releases.

## United American Video Corporation/Sterling Entertainment Group[]

### 1984–1988[]

**Bumper**: Over the American flag, we see the words "***For best picture quality, adjust tracking control on VCR.***" with the wiping effect with red, white and blue lines. This is apparently part of the 1984 UAV logo.

**FX/SFX**: The wiping in of the text.

**Music/Sounds**: None.

**Availability**: Seen on some early UAV VHS tapes. Not all of them contain this bumper, so be on the lookout.

### 1988–1991[]

**Bumper**: On a mostly blue gradient starry background with black in the top right corner, we see the words "**For best picture quality, adjust tracking control on VCR.**" before the 1989 UAV logo appears.

**Variant**: An additional screen is used on VHS tapes of public domain cartoons: "**These classic cartoons were mastered from the best original film print available. Slight imperfections common in early cartoon animation may be visible.**" Afterwards, the standard text is shown.

**FX/SFX**: The fading in of the text.

**Music/Sounds**: None.

**Availability**: Seen on most UAV VHS tapes from the era such as *Daffy Duck* and *43: The Petty Story*. On UAV releases of Samuel Goldwyn films, like *Southern Comfort* and *Lovers and Liars*, the blue background variant of the 1979 [Warner Home Video](/wiki/Warner_Bros._Home_Entertainment_Warning_Screens/United_States_of_America_and_Canada "Warner Bros. Home Entertainment Warning Screens/United States of America and Canada") warning screen appears in the place of this bumper instead.

**Editor's Note**: Since the UAV logo follows this, it can scare some.

### 1991–2006[]

**Bumper**: On a black background, we see the words "For better picture quality adjust tracking control on your VCR." in a white typewriter-like font.

**Variants**:

*   On some VHS releases from Sterling Entertainment Group and its labels Gemstone Entertainment and Ovation Home Video, the text is displayed in Arial Bold. This variant debuted in 1999 on *Curious George Comes to America* and the Sterling reprint of *Where the Red Fern Grows Part II*, and was used until 2002.
*   Beginning in 2003, the version of the text introduced in 1999 is slightly wider, spaced tighter, and in Helvetica Bold.

**FX/SFX**: None.

**Music/Sounds**: A few seconds of silence, followed by a young-sounding man reading the message.

**Music/Sounds Variant**: Beginning with *Curious George Comes to America*, the voiceover is louder and starts when the bumper fades in.

**Availability**: Very common.

*   Seen on many UAV, Sterling, Ovation, and Gemstone slipcover VHS tapes, such as *Casper the Friendly Ghost*, the UAV VHS issues of *Felix the Cat* and *Beauty and the Beast*, *Little Lulu: A Bout with a Trout*, *Santa and the Three Bears*, *Santa’s Surprise*, *Baby Huey: Quack-a-Doodle-Doo*, *Robin Hood Makes Good*, *Little Audrey and Friends*, *Kansas City Confidential*, the Enchanted Collection, *Cartoon Fest* and *Cartoon Carnival* series, *Baby Huey: Perfect Pupil*, *Mutt and Jeff’s Wacky Western Cartoon*, and the slipcover versions of early UAV Gold releases such as *Gulliver’s Travels*, *The Jungle Book*, *Jurassic Giants*, *Dinosaurs of the Jurassic*, and *Operation Dalmatian*.
*   This doesn't appear on the company’s releases with the first two logos, as they have their own tracking control disclaimers in their logos.
*   The easiest way to determine whether or not this will appear is by looking at a disclaimer printed on the sticker label on the tape that states, "**FOR BEST PICTURE ADJUST VCR TRACKING CONTROL**". Releases with "**RESULTS**" replacing "**PICTURE**" on this disclaimer, such as the clamshell issues of all UAV Gold releases, contain the [company's fourth FBI warning screen](/wiki/Sterling_Entertainment_Group_Warning_Screens "Sterling Entertainment Group Warning Screens") instead.

**Editor's Note**: If you're not expecting the man reading the message, it may scare you, but it's otherwise harmless.

## Media Home Entertainment/Maier Group/Random House Home Video/Starmaker[]

### 1980s–1990s[]

**Bumper**: On a black background appears the white text "**FOR MAXIMUM PICTURE QUALITY**" and the blue text "**IT MAY BE NECESSARY TO ADJUST THE TRACKING CONTROL ON YOUR VCR**". The screen lasts for 15 seconds until it finally fades out slowly.

**Variant**: There is a version on a different font.

**FX/SFX**: None.

**Music/Sounds**: Three seconds of silence, followed by a man reading the text out loud by saying "Please note: For maximum picture quality, it may be necessary to adjust the tracking control on your VCR." After that, the rest of the screen remains silent.

**Music/Sounds Variant**:

*   Sometimes, a different announcer is heard on the variant.
*   On the 1995 VHS release of *Final Impact*, the announcer is not heard.

**Availability**: Uncommon for the most part, but it was seen on the 1990 Hi-Tops/Media Home Entertainment release of *Madeline* (released through Hi-Tops Video). It was also seen on some Random House Home Video releases such as a few *The Bernstain Bears* videos as well as Maier Group's *Inspector Gadget* tapes. It was also seen on some *Festival of Family Classics* tapes from Starmaker and the VHS release of *National Lampoon's Class Reunion*. Also makes surprise appearances on *Three Amigos!*, *The Jungle Book: Kichi Is Alone*, J2's 1987 VHS of *Elton John Live in Australia*, and Vestron's 1991 VHS of *Billy Crystal: Don't Get Me Started*.

**Editor's Note**: If you're not expecting the man reading the message, it may scare you, but it's otherwise harmless.

## Media Home Entertainment (standalone)[]

### 1981–1987[]

**Bumper**: On a blue background is the white text "**PLEASE ADJUST TRACKING FOR BEST PICTURE QUALITY.**" and "**THANK YOU**".

**Variant**: On Burbank Video releases, the text is smaller and "**THANK YOU**" is missing.

**FX/SFX**: None.

**Music/Sounds**: None.

**Availability**: Seen on certain Media Home Entertainment VHS releases of the era. It was also preserved on several Video Treasures re-releases of the aforementioned titles.

### 1987–1993[]

VCR Service Message Media Home Entertainment (Later Day)

**Bumper**: On a red/orange gradient background, there is a white figure guy holding a wrench and the white text "**FOR BETTER VIDEO VIEWING HAVE VCR SERVICE CHECKS.**" on the top. Below them is a white bar, and underneath it is the first portion of another white text, which reads:

**MEDIA HOME ENTERTAINMENT
& YOUR VIDEO ENTERTAIN-
MENT RETAILER RECOMMEND
YOU HAVE YOUR VCR
ROUTINELY SERVICED
TWICE A YEAR TO
IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF
YOUR VIEWING, PROLONG
THE LIFE OF THE VCR, AND
TO MINIMIZE THE RISK OF
DAMAGE TO THIS VIDEO
CASSETTE.**

4 seconds later, the figure with the wrench slides away to the right (as if he was running) and then 5 seconds later, the bottom text scrolls up, revealing the rest of itself. After that, it stops scrolling to show the last portion.

**FX/SFX**: The figure sliding away, the scrolling of the second text.

**Music/Sounds**: None.

**Availability**: Seen on certain Media Home Entertainment VHS tapes of the era.

## Celebrity Home Entertainment[]

### 1985–1998[]

**Bumper**: On a white background, we see the text "**FOR THE BEST POSSIBLE PICTURE PLEASE ADJUST** **THE TRACKING KNOB ON YOUR VIDEO MACHINE**", with "**THE TRACKING KNOB**" blinking on and off.

**FX/SFX**: The blinking of "**THE TRACKING KNOB**".

**Music/Sounds**: A man reading the message, which sounds like it was recorded in an auditorium.

**Availability**: Found on some Celebrity Home Entertainment VHS releases, most notably the *Mighty Mouse* compilation tape and the Celebrity VHS issues of *Superman* and *Felix the Cat*.

**Editor's Note**: If you're not used to the man reading the message, it may at least surprise you, but it's otherwise completely harmless.

## Just for Kids[]

### 1985-1997, 1999, 2001[]

**Bumper**: Two bumpers were produced.

**Variant**: A variant of the second bumper exists; check the page linked above for more details.

**FX/SFX**: Live-action and, in the case of the first bumper, some chroma-key effects.

**Music/Sounds**: Noel C. Bloom, Jr. talks about their tracking message. On the first bumper, a synthpop instrumental plays while Noel is talking. Both bumpers have different messages; check the page linked above for more details.

**Music/Sounds Variant**: On tapes that have the first bumper, Noel C. Bloom, Jr. talks about their message about their upcoming releases after the program. Likewise, there's a version of the second bumper with no "stay tuned" message; check the page linked above for more details.

**Availability**: The first version is very rare and seen on some early 1-hour sell-thru tapes from the era. The second version is uncommon, and seen on most Just for Kids sell-thru tapes such as *Gulliver's Travels*, and the stay tuned version is seen on some prints of *Rude Dog* tapes, among others.

**Editor's Note**: On the first bumper, it's quite obvious that Noel is reading his lines off a cue card, as you can see his eyes move from left to right and so on.

## Simitar Entertainment[]

### 1990–2000[]

**Bumper**: On a sky blue background, we see the words "Recorded in EP Mode If you experience picture problems, adjust Tracking Control" in a silver, condensed Times New Roman font.

**Variant**: On earlier releases with this bumper, the background is solid blue, and the font is different and wider.

**FX/SFX**: None.

**Music/Sounds**: None.

**Availability**: Seen on Simitar tapes with the Gold S logo (currently unknown if it appears on releases with the Giant S logo). The easy way to determine whether or not this will appear is by looking at the tape to see if it says EP Mode. It was rarely seen on the *Awesome*/*Funtastic* series and the *I Wanna Be* series but it might be on other tapes as well, such as *Godzilla* tapes. The first version can be seen on *Awesome Airplanes*, *Awesome Motorcycles*, *Awesome Trains,* and *The John Wayne Anthology: The Star Packer/Lawless Range*. It also made a surprise appearance on *Awesome Mining* due to the fact that the tape has been recorded in SP Mode instead of EP.

## Vestron Video[]

### 1989[]

**Bumper**: On a blue background is the white text **"This Cassette is Recorded In The Extended Play Mode. Please Adjust Tracking"** in quotes.

**FX/SFX**: None.

**Music/Sounds**: None.

**Availability**: Extremely rare. Found on the 1989 screener/demo tape of *Gleaming the Cube*.

**Editor's Note**: Is there really any reason for the text to be in quotations?

## Parade Video[]

### Late 1986-Early 1990[]

**Bumper**: On a black/blue gradient background appears the white text:

***ALL VCRs ARE DIFFERENT
TRACKING ADJUSTMENT
MAY BE NECESSARY.***

It fades out as the [warning](/wiki/Parade_Video_Warning_Screens "Parade Video Warning Screens") fades in.

**FX/SFX**: The fading.

**Music/Sounds**: None.

**Availability**: This can be seen on some Parade Video VHS releases that have been recorded in EP Mode.

## Malofilm Video[]

recorder's tracking control.

**Cinema Club** has
recorded this programme on high quality
video tape to provide you with great
sound and vision quality.

In the unlikely event of any picture interference,
please adjust your video recorder's tracking control.
This will, in most cases, rectify both sound
and vision quality.

This fades out, leaving just the filmstrip and transitioning to the warning screen.

**FX/SFX**: The fading between this and the warning screen.

**Music/Sounds**: None.

**Availability**: Common. Appears on many, many VHS releases from Cinema Club from the time.

**Editor's Note**: While this bumper sounds like a very easy find like with the warning it's attached to, just bear in mind that some tapes - mostly early ones - don't have it.

**FX/SFX**: The words coming in and out.

**Music/Sounds**: None.

**Availability**: It appears on numerous videos from the Video Treasures era, such as all of their *Thomas The Tank Engine* VHS tapes, but sometimes, it skips to the [company’s FBI warning](/wiki/Anchor_Bay_Entertainment_Warning_Screens "Anchor Bay Entertainment Warning Screens"). For some reason, this also appears on a few tapes recorded in SP mode, including *Zombie*. Also seen on early Anchor Bay Entertainment VHS releases and 1995-98 Starmaker VHS releases. It also appears on an *Elephant Show* VHS release from Drive Entertainment.

**Editor's Note**: Since it usually makes a jarring cut to the FBI warning used during this era, it could make someone jump.
