- en: I like DuckDuckGo. I have used their search engine [for ten years](https://thejollyteapot.com/2022/02/4/saying-goodbye-to-duckduckgo).
    I like their stance on privacy. I even like their cartoon duck.

- en: 'Most of you would probably say: “It’s a search engine, like Google.” While
    this is true, it’s also incomplete. If “search engine” was the obvious answer
    five years ago, I don’t think it is anymore.'

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: DuckDuckGo seems to spend a lot of time and effort on building web browsers,
    privacy-focused tools, but not so much time on search. If the search engine is
    the point-of-entry into their brand ecosystem — and apparently the main way they
    make money via ads — I don’t think search is their main product anymore.

    For starters, this confusion comes from the names of the company’s products. Everything
    is called DuckDuckGo: the browser, the search engine, the company, &c.'

- en: Considering DuckDuckGo’s focus on privacy and what the company stands for — particularly
    crucial given the prevalence of [surveillance advertising](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2023/05/save-news-we-must-ban-surveillance-advertising) — it’s
    apt to draw comparisons to Mozilla. However, while Mozilla keeps product names
    straightforward, DuckDuckGo’s naming approach can be confusing.
  prefs: []

- en: At Mozilla, Firefox is the name of the browser and all products linked to the
    browser have Firefox in their name, and Mozilla is both the company name and the
    name of products not directly related to the in-house browser. The [Mozilla family
    of products](https://www.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/products/) revolves around
    two big categories, with two distinct names. It’s fairly easy to understand.

- en: At DuckDuckGo, everything is called DuckDuckGo, and depending on where you look,
    there are subtle differences. How is the browser called? The DuckDuckGo [browser](https://duckduckgo.com/app).
    Or the DuckDuckGo [app](https://duckduckgo.com). Or just plain [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/mac).
    Which one is it? It’s very confusing, and I believe it says a lot about the company’s
    focus and direction, hopefully not indicating a lack thereof.

    brand itself, and the content they publish, the sad truth is that the search engine
    hasn’t improved in the last couple of years. During the first years, I could identify
    the regular improvements, the regular refinements of the quality of the search
    results that made the overall experience increasingly better. But this feeling
    has disappeared for quite a long time.

    the team — and it is, don’t get me wrong. It’s a mediocre, sometimes decent, sometimes
    good search engine, which makes it easily one of the best, especially since [Google
    is not that great](https://thejollyteapot.com/2022/02/16/google-search-isn-t-very-good-and-yet-still-the-best-around)
    these days, [plagued by SEO mobs](https://mjtsai.com/blog/2023/06/19/inhuman-writing-for-google-is-eating-the-web/).

    search engine pushed them to diversify to foster loyalty of users? Maybe they
    somehow knew that the search industry was too hard to even attempt to do more?
    After all, if search was an easy industry, more companies would be in it.

    products without the advertising money made via search. Now that DuckDuckGo operates
    a web browser, maybe they don’t need search anymore? Mozilla, for instance, has
    a browser and doesn’t run a search engine.

    the browser, similar to how [Mozilla monetises Firefox](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2023-05-05/why-google-keeps-paying-mozilla-s-firefox-even-as-chrome-dominates)?

    product is privacy. It is a strong brand promise, and I believe they offer a good
    range of products in that area. However, I doubt they’ll be able to consistently
    maintain all of them at a high quality level.
