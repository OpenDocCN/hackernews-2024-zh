    his focus on affordability marked a shift from just a few months ago, when he
    boasted that US menu prices, which went up as much as 10% in 2023 alone, weren’t
    deterring sales.

    prices for everyday necessities remain high, and people are getting fed up. McDonald’s
    has become a regular target for social media users complaining about prices. Viral
    stories lamenting the cost of a Big Mac meal — particularly the $18 ones at a
    widely maligned Darien, Connecticut, location off I-95 — have become a TikTok
    genre unto themselves.

    prices vary depending on where you are. (So if you find yourself pulling off the
    highway for a quick bite at a travel center in Darien, one of the richest towns
    in America, you can reasonably expect your meal to cost significantly more than
    you would at a suburban drive-thru outside of Des Moines.)
