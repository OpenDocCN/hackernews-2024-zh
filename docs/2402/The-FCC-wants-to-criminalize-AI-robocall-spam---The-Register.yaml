- en: The agency believes the use of AI voice cloning technology in robocall scams
    should be criminalized under the 1991 Telephone Consumer Protection Act. Current
    laws require telemarketers to have explicit consent from consumers before they
    can make automated calls using "an artificial or prerecorded" voice. Rosenworcel
    believes the same rules should apply for AI-generated robo-calls too.

    Attorney General Michelle Henry wrote a letter [[PDF]](https://www.attorneygeneral.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/2024-01-16-Reply-Comment-of-State-AGs-FCC-AI-NOI.pdf)
    to the FCC and said that AI-generated voices should be classified as artificial
    voices, meaning that the TCPA should already protect against robocall scams made
    using voice cloning technologies. The letter was signed by 25 attorneys general
    from other states.
