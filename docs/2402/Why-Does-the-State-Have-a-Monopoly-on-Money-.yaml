    about central banks and the state monopoly over money. The main point of that
    previous post is that although economists tend to dislike monopoly and extol the
    virtues of competition, there is surprisingly little criticism of central banks
    among these same economists. A central bank has a monopoly over currency. Yet,
    as that post details, the issuance of money does not seem to have any of the characteristics
    traditionally used to justify a monopoly. This naturally begs the question: Why
    has the state’s monopoly over money persisted for so long? Why is this monopoly
    so durable?'

  zh: 我之前曾经[写过](https://pricetheory.substack.com/p/the-unquestioned-monopoly)关于中央银行和国家对货币的垄断。那篇先前文章的主要观点是，尽管经济学家倾向于不喜欢垄断并赞扬竞争的优点，但在这些经济学家中间对中央银行的批评却出奇地少。中央银行对货币有垄断。然而，正如那篇文章详细描述的那样，货币的发行似乎没有任何传统上用来证明垄断的特征。这自然引出了一个问题：为什么国家对货币的垄断如此长久地持续下去？为什么这种垄断如此持久？
- en: One place to start is with political motivations. A common answer that people
    will provide is that the state’s monopoly over money is motivated by its desire
    for revenue. If one has a monopoly over money, one could debase the currency (e.g.,
    turn 100 silver coins into 110 silver coins by reducing the silver content of
    the coins) or one could simply print more money to increase revenue. However,
    that argument is incomplete as it leaves several questions unanswered.

  zh: 一个起点是政治动机。人们通常会提供的一个常见答案是，国家对货币的垄断是出于其对收入的欲望。如果一个人对货币有垄断，可以贬值货币（例如，通过减少硬币的银含量将100枚银币变成110枚银币），或者可以简单地印更多的钱以增加收入。然而，这个论点是不完整的，因为它留下了几个问题没有回答。
- en: For example, a state monopoly on shoes or steel or baseball cards would also
    generate revenue. What makes a monopoly on money different from these other hypothetical
    monopolies? Also, if the primary motivation is revenue, why do so few states seem
    like they’re trying to maximize the revenue they get from the monopoly? Debasing
    money and printing money cause inflation, which in turn causes people to hold
    less money. Thus, if inflation is a “tax” on money, wouldn’t inflationary policy
    reduce the tax base over time?

  zh: 例如，国家对鞋子、钢铁或棒球卡片的垄断也会产生收入。是什么使得货币垄断不同于这些其他假设的垄断？另外，如果主要动机是收入，为什么似乎很少有国家试图最大化他们从垄断中获得的收入？贬值货币和印刷货币会导致通货膨胀，进而导致人们持有的货币减少。因此，如果通货膨胀是对货币的“税收”，通货膨胀政策难道不会随着时间的推移减少税基吗？
- en: Let’s start with what makes money different. Unlike revenue generated from other
    hypothetical monopolies, the monopoly on money provides the unique ability to
    the state of generating a lot of revenue quickly. A one-time (or short-term) increase
    in the money supply provides significant revenue. When the state is operating
    on a pure commodity standard, this can be done through debasement, or turning
    100 gold or silver coins into say 150 gold or silver coins. Under a fiat system,
    this can be done by expanding the money supply. As George Selgin and Larry White
    [highlight](https://www.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/alt-money-univ-reading-list/selgin-a-fiscal-theory-of-govt-role-in-money.pdf),
    estimates from the Medieval Europe suggest rulers generated as much as 92% of
    their revenue from debasement during times of war. This certainly seems to lend
    credence to the idea that the state’s monopoly is motivated by emergency financing.

  zh: 让我们从货币的不同之处开始。与其他假设垄断产生的收入不同，货币垄断为国家提供了一种独特的能力，即快速生成大量收入。一次性（或短期）增加货币供应可以提供显著的收入。当国家依靠纯商品标准运作时，这可以通过贬值来实现，例如将100枚金币或银币转换为150枚金币或银币。在法定货币制度下，这可以通过扩大货币供应来实现。正如乔治·塞尔金和拉里·怀特在其文章中[指出](https://www.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/alt-money-univ-reading-list/selgin-a-fiscal-theory-of-govt-role-in-money.pdf)，来自中世纪欧洲的估计表明，统治者在战争时期可能高达92%的收入来自贬值。这确实似乎支持了国家垄断受紧急融资驱动的观点。
- en: Of course, as stated above, debasement and money printing cause inflation. If
    people know the state will resort to inflation in an emergency, they will hold
    less money and inflation provides less emergency funding for the state. This seems
    to suggest that the ability to use money printing and debasement over the long
    term is limited.

  zh: 当然，正如上文所述，贬值和印钞引起通货膨胀。如果人们知道国家在紧急情况下会采取通胀政策，他们会持有更少的货币，而通胀则为国家提供了较少的紧急资金。这似乎表明，长期使用印钞和贬值的能力是有限的。
- en: To solve this problem, rulers have to commit to something we would now call
    long-run price stability. In the days of pure commodity standards, a king might
    follow a period of debasement by converting the debased coins to full-bodied coins.
    (There is [evidence](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4587080)
    that kings used recoinage as a commitment device.) A commitment to do so is tantamount
    to promising that any inflation will be followed by a corresponding deflation.
    Thus, over the long run, the coins would maintain their purchasing power and anchor
    money demand. Rulers could then use debasement in an emergency without the concern
    of limiting the future “tax base.” It is hard to provide another explanation for
    why rulers would commit to recoinage.

  zh: 为了解决这个问题，统治者必须承诺做某些我们现在称为长期价格稳定的事情。在纯商品标准时代，国王可能会在贬值后通过将贬值的硬币转换为全本位硬币来解决问题。（有[证据](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4587080)表明，国王使用重新铸币作为承诺设备。）这样的承诺等同于承诺任何通货膨胀都将随之而来的紧缩。因此，长期来看，硬币将保持其购买力并锚定货币需求。统治者随后可以在紧急情况下使用贬值，而无需担心限制未来的“税基”。很难提供另一种解释，说明为何统治者要承诺重新铸币。
- en: As Earl Thompson [explained](https://www.academia.edu/149707/_The_Gold_Standard_Causes_and_Consequences_),
    an innovation of the Bank of England was applying the same logic to convertible
    paper money. During wartime the British would suspend the convertibility of bank
    notes with the promise to restore convertibility at the previous parity after
    the war. This allowed the Bank of England to help finance the war with note issuance
    without the fear of a wave of redemptions at the Bank and a drain of its gold
    reserves. In addition, the commitment to restore the previous parity was equivalent
    to a promise to offset any inflation created during the war from note issuance
    with a corresponding deflation after the war. Many people, including many economists,
    have criticized this practice since the policy-induced deflations were particularly
    costly. They argue that after the war it might be best to let bygones be bygones
    and simply devalue the unit of account to avoid the costly deflation. However,
    if one recognizes the state’s desire for emergency financing, it is obvious that
    this commitment to restore the previous parity is necessary for long-term emergency
    financing. Without that commitment, money demand would decline over time in anticipation
    that the currency would be permanently devalued in an emergency and this would
    make it difficult for the state to use the same tool of emergency finance in the
    future.

  zh: 作为[厄尔·汤普森（Earl Thompson）](https://www.academia.edu/149707/_The_Gold_Standard_Causes_and_Consequences_)解释过的，英格兰银行的一个创新是将同样的逻辑应用于可转换纸币。在战时，英国人会暂停银行票据的兑换能力，并承诺战后恢复之前的兑换比率。这使得英格兰银行能够通过发行纸币来帮助战争的资金需求，而不必担心银行出现大量赎回以及黄金储备的流失。此外，恢复先前兑换比率的承诺相当于承诺在战时通过发行纸币造成的任何通货膨胀将在战后通过相应的紧缩来抵消。许多人，包括许多经济学家，批评了这种做法，因为政策导致的紧缩尤为昂贵。他们认为，战后最好是让既往不咎，简单地降低计价单位，以避免昂贵的紧缩。然而，如果一个人认识到国家对紧急融资的需求，显然恢复先前的兑换比率对于长期的紧急融资是必要的。如果没有这种承诺，随着时间的推移，货币需求会因为预期在紧急情况下可能会永久贬值而下降，这将使得国家未来难以再次使用同样的紧急融资工具。
- en: In my own work, I have [shown](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0167268120300019)
    the importance of these commitments to effectively financing war with money creation.
    In particular, I contrast the experience of Sweden and the early Riksbank with
    the Bank of England. It is evident that Sweden’s military failures were tied to
    financing constraints created by their parliament and the Riksbank and an unwillingness
    to use the gold standard in the same way as the British.

- en: As people like David Glasner have [pointed out](https://www.independent.org/store/book.asp?id=45),
    the idea that the state monopoly on money is really about emergency financing
    for things like wars can also help us to understand why counterfeiting has historically
    been treated as treasonous. Why should the crime of counterfeiting be treated
    as treason? Well, if one thinks that the state’s monopoly on money is necessary
    to provide emergency financing for war, then counterfeiting is an impediment to
    adequate financing. When presented in that light, it is not surprising that it
    would be treated as treasonous.

  zh: 正如[大卫·格拉斯纳（David Glasner）等人所指出的](https://www.independent.org/store/book.asp?id=45)，国家对货币的垄断实际上是为了像战争这样的紧急融资，这也帮助我们理解为什么历史上将伪造货币视为叛国行为。为什么伪造货币的罪行应被视为叛国罪？如果认为国家对货币的垄断是为了提供战争等紧急融资，那么伪造货币就是充足融资的障碍。从这个角度来看，它被视为叛国罪也就不足为奇了。
- en: Thus, the story of the state monopoly over money is a political economy story.
    Yet, an understanding of price theory is necessary to put the pieces of that story
    together. It is important to understand how markets respond to policy and how
    people’s expectations shape their demand decisions. Armed with this knowledge,
    one can not only begin to understand why the state desires a monopoly on money,
    but also why the state’s monopoly on money has persisted for such a long period
    of time.
