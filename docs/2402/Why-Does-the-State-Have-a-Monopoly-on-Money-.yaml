    about central banks and the state monopoly over money. The main point of that
    previous post is that although economists tend to dislike monopoly and extol the
    virtues of competition, there is surprisingly little criticism of central banks
    among these same economists. A central bank has a monopoly over currency. Yet,
    as that post details, the issuance of money does not seem to have any of the characteristics
    traditionally used to justify a monopoly. This naturally begs the question: Why
    has the state’s monopoly over money persisted for so long? Why is this monopoly
    so durable?'

    will provide is that the state’s monopoly over money is motivated by its desire
    for revenue. If one has a monopoly over money, one could debase the currency (e.g.,
    turn 100 silver coins into 110 silver coins by reducing the silver content of
    the coins) or one could simply print more money to increase revenue. However,
    that argument is incomplete as it leaves several questions unanswered.

    generate revenue. What makes a monopoly on money different from these other hypothetical
    monopolies? Also, if the primary motivation is revenue, why do so few states seem
    like they’re trying to maximize the revenue they get from the monopoly? Debasing
    money and printing money cause inflation, which in turn causes people to hold
    less money. Thus, if inflation is a “tax” on money, wouldn’t inflationary policy
    reduce the tax base over time?

    hypothetical monopolies, the monopoly on money provides the unique ability to
    the state of generating a lot of revenue quickly. A one-time (or short-term) increase
    in the money supply provides significant revenue. When the state is operating
    on a pure commodity standard, this can be done through debasement, or turning
    100 gold or silver coins into say 150 gold or silver coins. Under a fiat system,
    this can be done by expanding the money supply. As George Selgin and Larry White
    [highlight](https://www.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/alt-money-univ-reading-list/selgin-a-fiscal-theory-of-govt-role-in-money.pdf),
    estimates from the Medieval Europe suggest rulers generated as much as 92% of
    their revenue from debasement during times of war. This certainly seems to lend
    credence to the idea that the state’s monopoly is motivated by emergency financing.

    people know the state will resort to inflation in an emergency, they will hold
    less money and inflation provides less emergency funding for the state. This seems
    to suggest that the ability to use money printing and debasement over the long
    term is limited.

    long-run price stability. In the days of pure commodity standards, a king might
    follow a period of debasement by converting the debased coins to full-bodied coins.
    (There is [evidence](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4587080)
    that kings used recoinage as a commitment device.) A commitment to do so is tantamount
    to promising that any inflation will be followed by a corresponding deflation.
    Thus, over the long run, the coins would maintain their purchasing power and anchor
    money demand. Rulers could then use debasement in an emergency without the concern
    of limiting the future “tax base.” It is hard to provide another explanation for
    why rulers would commit to recoinage.

    an innovation of the Bank of England was applying the same logic to convertible
    paper money. During wartime the British would suspend the convertibility of bank
    notes with the promise to restore convertibility at the previous parity after
    the war. This allowed the Bank of England to help finance the war with note issuance
    without the fear of a wave of redemptions at the Bank and a drain of its gold
    reserves. In addition, the commitment to restore the previous parity was equivalent
    to a promise to offset any inflation created during the war from note issuance
    with a corresponding deflation after the war. Many people, including many economists,
    have criticized this practice since the policy-induced deflations were particularly
    costly. They argue that after the war it might be best to let bygones be bygones
    and simply devalue the unit of account to avoid the costly deflation. However,
    if one recognizes the state’s desire for emergency financing, it is obvious that
    this commitment to restore the previous parity is necessary for long-term emergency
    financing. Without that commitment, money demand would decline over time in anticipation
    that the currency would be permanently devalued in an emergency and this would
    make it difficult for the state to use the same tool of emergency finance in the
    future.

    the importance of these commitments to effectively financing war with money creation.
    In particular, I contrast the experience of Sweden and the early Riksbank with
    the Bank of England. It is evident that Sweden’s military failures were tied to
    financing constraints created by their parliament and the Riksbank and an unwillingness
    to use the gold standard in the same way as the British.

    the idea that the state monopoly on money is really about emergency financing
    for things like wars can also help us to understand why counterfeiting has historically
    been treated as treasonous. Why should the crime of counterfeiting be treated
    as treason? Well, if one thinks that the state’s monopoly on money is necessary
    to provide emergency financing for war, then counterfeiting is an impediment to
    adequate financing. When presented in that light, it is not surprising that it
    would be treated as treasonous.

    Yet, an understanding of price theory is necessary to put the pieces of that story
    together. It is important to understand how markets respond to policy and how
    people’s expectations shape their demand decisions. Armed with this knowledge,
    one can not only begin to understand why the state desires a monopoly on money,
    but also why the state’s monopoly on money has persisted for such a long period
    of time.
