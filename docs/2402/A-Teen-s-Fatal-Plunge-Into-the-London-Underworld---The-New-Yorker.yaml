- en: Sharma was calling from Apartment 504\. If he’d stepped out onto the balcony,
    or just looked out a window, he likely would have seen the dead body down below.
    Perhaps he called Nunes to find out whether the police had drawn a connection
    between the body and the building. Or perhaps Sharma believed that, through some
    wild coincidence, it was someone else’s corpse, and Zac had survived the fall.
    This might explain why he sent the chauffeur, Carlton, to visit the apartment

    that day. Yet when Shamji met with the Brettlers at the Méridien hotel, three
    days later, he didn’t mention that a corpse had been discovered outside Riverwalk
    hours after Zac went missing. Nor did Sharma or Shamji alert the police that the

    with a gruff “No comment.” Although both he and Shamji had been arrested on suspicion
    of murder, they were released on bail, and were free to go on with their lives.
    To Matthew and Rachelle, it felt as if, after an initial flurry of activity, the
    investigation started to lose momentum. “They took their foot off the gas,” Rachelle
    said. Some of this was likely a consequence of the pandemic, which set in not
    long after Zac died. The Brettlers may also have contributed, inadvertently, to
    the diminution in the energies of the London Metropolitan Police by keeping the
    whole incident relatively quiet. The death itself was not a secret: “I have the
    saddest news. Our beautiful son Zac died,” Rachelle wrote in a Facebook post.
    Family and friends turned out in large numbers for a funeral at Hoop Lane, a Jewish
    cemetery in Golders Green. But the London press, which is insatiable when it comes
    to the mysterious deaths of young white people, never picked up on the story.
    No florid *Daily Mail* spread featuring photographs of Zac and Riverwalk; no grandstanding
    about police inaction. The result was a lack of sustained pressure on law enforcement.
    And the Brettlers, at least at first, put their trust in the authorities, assuming
    that the unexplained death of a nineteen-year-old from West London would compel
    a rigorous investigation.'

    Lane为他举行了盛大的葬礼。但是伦敦的新闻界，当涉及到年轻白人的神秘死亡时，从未报道过这个故事。没有关于扎克和Riverwalk的花哨的《每日邮报》报道，也没有关于警方不作为的大肆渲染。结果就是对执法部门缺乏持续的压力。而布雷特勒一家，至少起初，还是对当局抱有信任，认为一名来自伦敦西部的19岁青年的死因未解应该会引起严格的调查。

    might seem naïve anywhere these days, but especially in London. In 2014, a fifty-two-year-old
    resident named Scot Young died in circumstances similar to Zac Brettler’s, plunging
    from a fourth-floor apartment in Marylebone and getting impaled on a wrought-iron
    railing. Young was a property developer who’d become mixed up with unsavory Russian
    businessmen. Before his death, he told friends and family that he feared for his
    life. But the Metropolitan Police declared the death unsuspicious; they didn’t
    even dust the apartment for fingerprints. As it happened, a month earlier, a friend
    of Young’s, Johnny Elichaoff, had died after falling from the roof of a shopping
    center in Bayswater. Suicide, police had concluded. A vicious killer appeared
    to be stalking London: gravity. The Russian oligarch Boris Berezovsky had died
    in 2013, hanging himself, supposedly, at his Berkshire estate, after many attempts
    on his life by adversaries who wanted him dead. The previous year, another friend
    of Young’s, Robbie Curtis, who’d also become entangled with dodgy Russians, died

    made suicide plausible. But the fact of so many sudden deaths over a short period
    of time involving high-flying London businessmen with Russian connections seemed
    dubious on its face. The press called the alleged suicides a “ring of death,”
    but as far as Scotland Yard was concerned they were just a series of unfortunate
    events. In 2017, BuzzFeed News published a [groundbreaking investigation](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/heidiblake/from-russia-with-blood-14-suspected-hits-on-british-soil)
    identifying fourteen men “who all died suspiciously on British soil after making
    powerful enemies in Russia.” According to the report, U.S. intelligence had shared
    evidence suggesting that numerous deaths being described by the London police
    as suicides had actually been murders. But a culture of timidity within British
    law enforcement, combined with weak institutional capacity after years of budget
    cuts, had shut down investigations. Some people expressed an even darker view:
    Britain had become so reliant on the largesse of Russia’s oligarchs that decisions
    had been made at a high level not to persecute London’s new mafia class, thereby
    extending to them the courtesy of being able to kill their enemies on British
    soil with impunity. One national-security adviser to the British government told
    BuzzFeed that ministers were desperate not “to antagonise the Russians.”'

  zh: 在每种情况下，都有一些情境——债务、药物、离婚、抑郁——使自杀成为可能。但在短时间内涉及与俄罗斯有关联的高飞的伦敦商人的这么多突然死亡事例，从表面上看似乎是可疑的。媒体称这些所谓的自杀为“死亡环”，但据苏格兰场认为，它们只是一系列不幸事件。2017年，《BuzzFeed
    News》发表了一篇[开创性调查](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/heidiblake/from-russia-with-blood-14-suspected-hits-on-british-soil)，确定了14名“在英国土地上死于可疑事件的男子，他们在与俄罗斯结下的强大敌人之后死亡”。根据报道，美国情报部门分享了证据，表明伦敦警方描述的许多死亡实际上是谋杀。但在英国执法部门内存在一种胆怯的文化，再加上多年来预算削减导致的机构能力不足，已经关闭了调查。一些人表达了更加黑暗的观点：英国已经变得如此依赖俄罗斯寡头的慷慨，以至于在高层决策层面上决定不迫害伦敦的新黑手党阶级，从而使他们有权在英国土地上无罪地杀死他们的敌人。一位英国政府的国家安全顾问告诉BuzzFeed，部长们非常希望不要“激怒俄罗斯人”。

    owned a pair of Range Rovers. Lejonvarn was Zac’s doubles partner in tennis, and
    Matthew Brettler once drove them to a tournament. Before Matthew picked them up,
    Zac warned Lejonvarn that both Range Rovers were in the shop for repairs; his
    father would be driving a Mazda, and was “very touchy” about it, so Lejonvarn
    shouldn’t under any circumstances mention the Range Rovers. When Lejonvarn, who’d
    been expecting to meet a hardened arms dealer, got in the car, he was surprised
