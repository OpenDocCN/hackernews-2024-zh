    or just looked out a window, he likely would have seen the dead body down below.
    Perhaps he called Nunes to find out whether the police had drawn a connection
    between the body and the building. Or perhaps Sharma believed that, through some
    wild coincidence, it was someone else’s corpse, and Zac had survived the fall.
    This might explain why he sent the chauffeur, Carlton, to visit the apartment
    in Maida Vale that morning.

    that day. Yet when Shamji met with the Brettlers at the Méridien hotel, three
    days later, he didn’t mention that a corpse had been discovered outside Riverwalk
    hours after Zac went missing. Nor did Sharma or Shamji alert the police that the
    victim might have fallen from Sharma’s balcony, which would have enabled them
    to identify Zac—and commence their investigation—four days earlier.

    with a gruff “No comment.” Although both he and Shamji had been arrested on suspicion
    of murder, they were released on bail, and were free to go on with their lives.
    To Matthew and Rachelle, it felt as if, after an initial flurry of activity, the
    investigation started to lose momentum. “They took their foot off the gas,” Rachelle
    said. Some of this was likely a consequence of the pandemic, which set in not
    long after Zac died. The Brettlers may also have contributed, inadvertently, to
    the diminution in the energies of the London Metropolitan Police by keeping the
    whole incident relatively quiet. The death itself was not a secret: “I have the
    saddest news. Our beautiful son Zac died,” Rachelle wrote in a Facebook post.
    Family and friends turned out in large numbers for a funeral at Hoop Lane, a Jewish
    cemetery in Golders Green. But the London press, which is insatiable when it comes
    to the mysterious deaths of young white people, never picked up on the story.
    No florid *Daily Mail* spread featuring photographs of Zac and Riverwalk; no grandstanding
    about police inaction. The result was a lack of sustained pressure on law enforcement.
    And the Brettlers, at least at first, put their trust in the authorities, assuming
    that the unexplained death of a nineteen-year-old from West London would compel
    a rigorous investigation.'

    might seem naïve anywhere these days, but especially in London. In 2014, a fifty-two-year-old
    resident named Scot Young died in circumstances similar to Zac Brettler’s, plunging
    from a fourth-floor apartment in Marylebone and getting impaled on a wrought-iron
    railing. Young was a property developer who’d become mixed up with unsavory Russian
    businessmen. Before his death, he told friends and family that he feared for his
    life. But the Metropolitan Police declared the death unsuspicious; they didn’t
    even dust the apartment for fingerprints. As it happened, a month earlier, a friend
    of Young’s, Johnny Elichaoff, had died after falling from the roof of a shopping
    center in Bayswater. Suicide, police had concluded. A vicious killer appeared
    to be stalking London: gravity. The Russian oligarch Boris Berezovsky had died
    in 2013, hanging himself, supposedly, at his Berkshire estate, after many attempts
    on his life by adversaries who wanted him dead. The previous year, another friend
    of Young’s, Robbie Curtis, who’d also become entangled with dodgy Russians, died
    after falling in front of a Tube train. Two years before that, yet another Young
    friend, the British developer Paul Castle, was killed (again, by Tube train).'

    made suicide plausible. But the fact of so many sudden deaths over a short period
    of time involving high-flying London businessmen with Russian connections seemed
    dubious on its face. The press called the alleged suicides a “ring of death,”
    but as far as Scotland Yard was concerned they were just a series of unfortunate
    events. In 2017, BuzzFeed News published a [groundbreaking investigation](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/heidiblake/from-russia-with-blood-14-suspected-hits-on-british-soil)
    identifying fourteen men “who all died suspiciously on British soil after making
    powerful enemies in Russia.” According to the report, U.S. intelligence had shared
    evidence suggesting that numerous deaths being described by the London police
    as suicides had actually been murders. But a culture of timidity within British
    law enforcement, combined with weak institutional capacity after years of budget
    cuts, had shut down investigations. Some people expressed an even darker view:
    Britain had become so reliant on the largesse of Russia’s oligarchs that decisions
    had been made at a high level not to persecute London’s new mafia class, thereby
    extending to them the courtesy of being able to kill their enemies on British
    soil with impunity. One national-security adviser to the British government told
    BuzzFeed that ministers were desperate not “to antagonise the Russians.”'

    but they did come to fear that the Metropolitan Police had an inclination to categorize
    any suspicious death that wasn’t obviously a murder as a suicide. Rachelle and
    Matthew emphasized to me that they harbored no stigma about suicide, and resisted
    the notion that Zac killed himself only because so many clues pointed to something
    more nefarious.

    the police for information, and uncovered additional signs that their son may
    have been in danger. They spoke to a friend who’d seen him two days before he
    died (and who didn’t know about Zac’s oligarch persona). The two boys had gone
    for a drive, and Zac kept fearfully looking over his shoulder. He mentioned that
    he might have information for the authorities, and was considering going into
    police protection. I spoke with the friend recently, who asked that I not use
    his name. “He was being threatened by someone,” he told me. “Apparently, they
    threatened to harm his family.” Of course, it was difficult to know how seriously
    to take such talk from Zac, given his propensity for dramatic stories. Nevertheless,
    police recovered an iPad among Zac’s belongings, and discovered that two days
    before he died he had done an Internet search for “witness protection uk.”

    started early. Numerous former classmates told me about his inventions. “He made
    up quite a lot of stuff,” a friend who met Zac at Mill Hill when they were both
    thirteen said. “He told a lot of people that his mum was dead.” Zac probably concocted
    this lie for sympathy or attention, the friend ventured. As an insecure new arrival
    at a school that he had not wanted to attend, he may have discovered that compassion
    can be a shortcut to intimacy—and that many people will open their heart to a
    stranger if they hear he’s suffered a terrible loss.

    to wealth,” his Mill Hill housemate Andrei Lejonvarn recalled. Zac claimed that
    his family lived in One Hyde Park, and that his father was an arms dealer who
    owned a pair of Range Rovers. Lejonvarn was Zac’s doubles partner in tennis, and
    Matthew Brettler once drove them to a tournament. Before Matthew picked them up,
    Zac warned Lejonvarn that both Range Rovers were in the shop for repairs; his
    father would be driving a Mazda, and was “very touchy” about it, so Lejonvarn
    shouldn’t under any circumstances mention the Range Rovers. When Lejonvarn, who’d
    been expecting to meet a hardened arms dealer, got in the car, he was surprised
    by Matthew’s gently inquisitive manner. “He’s, you know, a nice guy,” Lejonvarn
    recalled. He said of Zac, “You could smell the bullshit.”

    seems to have been, Matthew offered the redemptive gloss of a mourning parent.
    His son, he said, had always had “a slightly preternatural ability to tell stories.”
    Being a boarding student, Matthew observed, is “a little like when you go to college,
    living away from your parents for the first time. It dawns on you that you’re
    meeting people who know absolutely nothing about you. You’ve got a tabula rasa—a
    reset point. You feel like you’ve got a little bit of editorial control in a way
    that you didn’t previously. I think that’s what happened with Zac. Being in that
    boarding environment with people who had this mind-boggling access to money, Zac
    suddenly saw a space in which he could create another version of himself.”

    fanciful tales to road-testing an alter ego in the more hazardous environment
    of adult London. Nobody I spoke to from Zac’s high schools remembered him pretending
    to be the son of a Russian or Kazakh oligarch. When did the charade begin? I recently
    spoke with Mark Foley, who confirmed that he has worked for many years as a consultant
    for Chelsea Football Club, managing properties. One evening in early 2019, he
    said, he attended an opening at the Chelsea Arts Club and got to talking with
    a young man who mentioned that he came from a wealthy Russian family. They agreed
    to meet for coffee several days later.

    ironic that Foley vouched for Zac’s story, because he is presumably no stranger
    to the post-Soviet oligarchy, given that Roman Abramovich owned Chelsea for nearly
    two decades. “From my knowledge of Russian investors, they’re a fairly secretive
    bunch,” Foley told me. “You didn’t always get the full story from them, and they
    played their cards close to their chest.” Zac, he said, struck him as “one of
    these types.”

    con man of the [Patricia Highsmith](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/patricia-highsmith)
    novels, who achieves the life style he covets by preying, brilliantly, on others’
    gullibility. But it’s startling to think that Foley could have been duped by a
    London teen-ager who’d never so much as vacationed in Russia—and that Zac might
    have been so reckless as to attempt this trick on precisely the sort of oligarch-adjacent
    Londoner poised to see through it.

    not wish to talk about,” he responded, declining to speak by phone or to meet
    in person. When I pressed, he wrote that Zac “had built an extraordinary web of
    lies,” and intimated that it would be insensitive of me to dredge up this sad
    story, saying that he didn’t “feel comfortable” taking Zac’s “parents deeper into
    these wounds.” But in subsequent weeks I e-mailed Shamji various questions, and
    he replied. His answers were slippery, and he outright ignored many difficult
    questions, but he was unfailingly, almost ostentatiously, polite.

    partner, John Connies-Laing, on a real-estate project in Lisbon. They needed financing,
    and Foley offered to introduce them to his new friend Zac. When I asked Shamji
    if he’d bothered to Google Zac’s name before the meeting, he responded, “Personal
    introductions in London are far more trusted than social media, particularly with
    Eastern Europeans who have to keep a lower profile.” When I asked Connies-Laing
    about this, he said, via e-mail, “Mark was well connected in the Oligarch world
    and I had absolutely no reason to think that Zac was not credible.”

    and Zac mentioned that he’d recently made an offer on a lavish home around the
    corner, on Hamilton Terrace. Zac was dressed casually, but, Shamji told me, he
    was convincing in his role. As Shamji explained to police, Zac “talked the life
    of a very rich young kid—he had fancy watches, fancy cars, planes, all the stuff
    that is very aspirational wealth in London.” Shamji didn’t actually *see* any
    cars or watches or planes, but he assumed that Zac preferred a more understated
    mode of presentation. As their friendship solidified, Zac began joining Shamji
    when he walked his dog. They’d meet in front of One Hyde Park. Shamji never saw
    Zac emerge from the building; he was always waiting outside.

    the project ultimately foundered. But Zac and Shamji pursued other opportunities
    together. Shamji was cagey when I inquired about the particulars, but I pieced
    together details in other ways. There had been a notion to sell fibre-optic cable
    to India. Zac introduced Shamji to the uncle of a friend of his who had the cable
    and was looking for a buyer. The three men met at the Dorchester, an extravagant
    hotel favored by London’s status-conscious rich. But, when I spoke to the potential
    business partner (who didn’t want me to use his name), he said that within minutes
    of sitting down he had the distinct impression that Shamji was “full of shit.”
    They’d scarcely ordered tea and scones when Shamji pulled out his phone to show
    off the photograph of his handshake with Prime Minister Modi. With a sigh, the
    man told me, “I know too many Akbars.” He was more impressed by Zac: “The frightening
    thing is, had he actually done some deals, he would have ended up a serious player.”'
