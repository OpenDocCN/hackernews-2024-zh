    best choice if you want an end-to-end encrypted email platform, and the nature
    of the service means it is inevitably used by bad actors. On February 8, a bomb
    threat was sent to 13 schools in Chennai, a city in the state of Tamil Nadu in
    southern India. The threat turned out to be a hoax, and the Tamil Nadu police
    found that the email was sent via a ProtonMail account.'

    Interpol, the Tamil Nadu police put in a request to India's Ministry of Electronics
    and Information Technology to block access to ProtonMail within the country, [according
    to](https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/it-ministry-looks-to-block-proton-mail-on-request-of-tamil-nadu-police-101707938167006.html)

    That request was granted today, with the government authority issuing an order
    to block the service in the region.

    which will likely entail delisting ProtonMail from the App Store and Play Store.
    That said, the website is still working as of writing, and the app is listed on
    both storefronts. This isn't the first instance where the Indian government went
    after the Swiss-based Proton AG. Proton VPN [pulled its servers out of the country](https://go.getproton.me/aff_c?offer_id=25&aff_id=1046&source=ac&aff_click_id=ac-us-1437021084676874745&url=https%3A%2F%2Fprotonvpn.com%2Fblog%2Fservers-india%2F%3FvisitorId%3Dho-%7Btransaction_id%7D%26aid%3D%7Baffiliate_id%7D%26offer_id%3D%7Boffer_id%7D%26url_id%3D%7Boffer_url_id%7D%26utm_campaign%3Dww-all-2a-vpn-gro_aff-g_acq-partners_program%26utm_medium%3Dlink%26utm_source%3Daid-tune-%7Baffiliate_id%7D%26utm_content%3D%7Boffer_id%7D%26hfp%3Dfalse%26spl%3D%7Baffiliate_id%7D&aff_sub2=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.androidcentral.com%2Fapps-software%2Findian-government-moves-to-ban-protonmail-after-bomb-threat)

    it was working with the government over the issue. "We are currently working to
    resolve this situation and are investigating how we can best work together with
    the Indian authorities to do so. We understand the urgency of the situation and
    are completely clear that our services are not to be used for illegal purposes.
    We routinely remove users who are found to be doing so and are willing to cooperate
    wherever possible within international cooperation agreements."

    As the email provider told *Hindustan Times*, it cannot do that under Swiss law:
    "Proton cannot answer directly to foreign law enforcement authorities, but Swiss
    authorities may assist foreign authorities with requests, provided they are valid
    under international assistance procedures and determined to be in compliance with
    Swiss law”'

    with end-to-end encryption. A host of encrypted apps were blocked at the start
    of last year — including the likes of Threema, Element, Wickrme, and Safeswiss
    — and the government is going after [WhatsApp to disable end-to-end encryption](https://www.deccanherald.com/technology/gadgets/govt-may-enforce-it-rules-on-whatsapp-to-reveal-id-of-fake-video-spreader-2728346),
    although it isn't clear how that would even work.

- en: 'Proton AG clearly agrees with that sentiment, as it said this to HT: "We condemn
    a potential block as a misguided measure that only serves to harm ordinary people.
    Blocking access to Proton is an ineffective and inappropriate response to the
    reported threats. It will not prevent cybercriminals from sending threats with
    another email service and will not be effective if the perpetrators are located
    outside of India."'
