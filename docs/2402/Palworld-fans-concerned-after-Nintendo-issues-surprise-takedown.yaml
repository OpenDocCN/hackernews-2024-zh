- en: So far the popularity of [*Palworld*](https://www.gamingbible.com/palworld)
    hasn’t dwindled. It’s still one of the most successful games on [Steam](https://www.gamingbible.com/steam)
    and now it’s [partnering with Xbox](https://www.gamingbible.com/news/platform/xbox/palworld-officially-partners-with-xbox-048902-20240201)
    to bring quality of life improvements and new features to the [Xbox](https://www.gamingbible.com/xbox)
    Series X/S version of the game.

- en: Of course it hasn’t been smooth sailing. The claim that *Palworld* is simply
    a rip-off of [Pokemon](https://www.gamingbible.com/pokemon) is an accusation that
    continues to hang over the game’s head, no matter how much fans defend it. Due
    to this similarity there’s growing concerns [Nintendo](https://www.gamingbible.com/nintendo)
    will eventually strike the game down, as the president of the company has promised
    action will be taken.

    one of the Pal designs has reportedly been hit with a DMCA from Nintendo for breaching
    copyright.

    through a Reddit community post that it’s since been taken down. The user who
    posted the news [said](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palworld/comments/1aqnz1d/huh_didnt_realize_the_big_n_was_the_legal_rights/?utm_source=embedv2&utm_medium=post_embed&utm_content=post_title&embed_host_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dexerto.com%2Fpalworld%2Fpalworld-fans-concerned-after-nintendo-issues-dmca-takedown-of-sparkit-design-2534292%2F):

    it “ridiculous” as Sparkit looks nothing like any of the Pokemon.

    especially if Nintendo does somehow have the power to strike down designs it doesn’t
    like or agree with.

- en: For the most part it’s safe to say the game itself is safe for now, as while
    there are a few similarities with the Pokemon brand, Palworld includes plenty
    of features to make it stand out on its own, with even more content on the way
    this year.
