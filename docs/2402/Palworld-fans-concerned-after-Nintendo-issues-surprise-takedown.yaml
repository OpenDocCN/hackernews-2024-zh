    a DMCA takedown of fan-made merchandise sporting a *Palworld* design.'

- en: So far the popularity of [*Palworld*](https://www.gamingbible.com/palworld)
    hasn’t dwindled. It’s still one of the most successful games on [Steam](https://www.gamingbible.com/steam)
    and now it’s [partnering with Xbox](https://www.gamingbible.com/news/platform/xbox/palworld-officially-partners-with-xbox-048902-20240201)
    to bring quality of life improvements and new features to the [Xbox](https://www.gamingbible.com/xbox)
    Series X/S version of the game.

- en: Of course it hasn’t been smooth sailing. The claim that *Palworld* is simply
    a rip-off of [Pokemon](https://www.gamingbible.com/pokemon) is an accusation that
    continues to hang over the game’s head, no matter how much fans defend it. Due
    to this similarity there’s growing concerns [Nintendo](https://www.gamingbible.com/nintendo)
    will eventually strike the game down, as the president of the company has promised
    action will be taken.

- en: Those concerns are growing once again as a piece of fan-made merch sporting
    one of the Pal designs has reportedly been hit with a DMCA from Nintendo for breaching
    copyright.

    through a Reddit community post that it’s since been taken down. The user who
    posted the news [said](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palworld/comments/1aqnz1d/huh_didnt_realize_the_big_n_was_the_legal_rights/?utm_source=embedv2&utm_medium=post_embed&utm_content=post_title&embed_host_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dexerto.com%2Fpalworld%2Fpalworld-fans-concerned-after-nintendo-issues-dmca-takedown-of-sparkit-design-2534292%2F):
    “Huh, didn''t realize ‘The Big N’ (Nintendo) was the legal rights holder to Sparkit…”'

    it “ridiculous” as Sparkit looks nothing like any of the Pokemon.

    especially if Nintendo does somehow have the power to strike down designs it doesn’t
    like or agree with.

- en: For the most part it’s safe to say the game itself is safe for now, as while
    there are a few similarities with the Pokemon brand, Palworld includes plenty
    of features to make it stand out on its own, with even more content on the way
    this year.
