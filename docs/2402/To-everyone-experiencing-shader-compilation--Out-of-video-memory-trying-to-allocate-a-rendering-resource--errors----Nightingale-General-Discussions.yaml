    when performing shader compilation is famously caused by broken CPUs, namely the
    Intel 13x and 14x series, and more specifically (but not solely) the 13900k and
    14900k variants.

    to open Event Viewer and do a parse for 'WHEA-Logger' warnings. Inside those entries,
    look for 'Translation Look Aside Buffer' and 'Internal Parity Error'. There will
    be lots. That's a bad CPU.

    OCCT whilst applying a very slight OC via BIOS, with SVID=Typical and LLC=4\.
    OCCT will out Core errors almost immediately and then throughout the rest of the
    run. You may even get OCCT to report Core errors without these BIOS tweaks, depending
    on how bad the CPU has gotten. Attempt any this at your own risk. I'm simply reiterating
    how I was able to isolate down.

    at 52x but it can vary (and still degrades, so needs more ongoing effort) or RMA.
    You can drop the PCore using Intel XTU but again, use at your own risk (although
    its fairly straightforward for anyone with basic PC tech understanding).

    a BIOS-level downclock), will provide a stable system. You can trust me, given
    I spent close to 6 weeks troubleshooting my own system before isolating it to
    the CPU.

    to load the game, but clicking away and trying again would mostly work. Then sometimes
    work. Then never work, indicating the CPU was degrading. Then even in times where
    it would load to the menu, trying to get to the staging area would crash out,
    again with the same error. Checking the game log, it pointed to the shader comp
    causing a fatal error.

    load up and go into a match but during gameplay, would CTD. Checking the game
    log again, it showed that shader decompression, due to traversal, was again causing
    a fatal error.

- en: The list of games affected is huge. Every DX12 shader based game will crash
    at least during initial shader comp or if not, as above, some time after. If shader
    comp can be gotten past, it might seem OK but as soon as you update the GPU driver,
    or the game is patched, it will perform shader comp again and that's why some
    people can see it as hit and miss.

    sometimes the error happens and if you try again the game works. Then after some
    time, the error happens more and its trickier to get games working. Then some
    time later, zero DX12 shader games run at all, complete breakdown.
