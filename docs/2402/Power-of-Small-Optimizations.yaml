    on your application than those from lower levels. It does not make a lot of sense
    to spend time on lower-level optimizations if, on the architecture level, your
    application is designed in a suboptimal way or the algorithms and data structures
    choices are wrong.

- en: For lower-level optimizations, sometimes people think that those optimizations
    always require the usage of some hardcore algorithms or writing code in inline
    assembly, but a lot of them are fairly simple. In fact, from my practice, clear
    and simple code is generally fast, and optimizations do not always make code extremely
    hard to read or think about. It is also great if your application components are
    well isolated so you can change the internal implementation of some components
    without affecting other components or the rest of the application.

    level of optimizations hierarchy, more often source code level optimizations,
    and if we measure them in lines of code, they are relatively small. It does not
    mean that such optimizations are easy because sometimes writing a “right” couple
    lines of code can be extremely hard and take a lot of time.

    profile your application, both in production and during development. You also
    need to be curious to explore every possible performance optimization opportunity.
    Even highly optimized places in your application can be optimized even further.

    the amount of data is small, but when the amount of data grows, the underlying
    algorithm or data structure needs to be changed.

    by data distribution. For example, if you know the cardinality of your data in
    advance, it is possible to choose a faster algorithm or data structure.

- en: Use specializations. You can specialize your algorithms and data structures
    for specific data types. For example, if you know that you need to sort integers,
    it makes sense to use radix sort instead of general comparison-based sort algorithms
    like pdqsort. Another example is if you need to sort integers, but they are always
    sorted or almost sorted, radix sort will be much slower than pdqsort.

    that can help you verify your optimization results or find regressions. Performance
    tests can also be very helpful in [finding places that you can optimize](cpu-dispatch-in-clickhouse.html#cpu-dispatch-optimization-places).

    can be improved” and always check all available introspection for potential places
    that can be improved. For example, you can always check all hot functions in `perf-top`
    during development to understand if anything can be improved. It is also great
    to check the [flame graphs](https://www.brendangregg.com/flamegraphs.html) and
    try to understand the big picture of how your application works and where it spends
    time.

- en: You always need to start optimization with places that take most of the time
    during application execution. But usually, after you optimize every such place,
    it is hard to understand which places to optimize next. For example, when you
    investigate some potential place, and you already know that this place takes 3-5%
    of the whole application execution time, it is important to still improve this
    place, even if you can improve this place’s performance only by a small amount.
    If you optimize many such places, the compound result of such optimizations will
    be visible for the whole application.

    places your application processes data in a single thread. Such single-thread
    execution stage is common for many algorithms like sorting and aggregation. You
    sort/aggregate data by multiple threads, but the final merge stage is single-threaded.
    This also applies to the distributed execution of such algorithms. Even a small
    improvement in that single-thread merge stage is a big win because those places
    do not scale with an increased amount of threads or servers.

    ran some queries that read a lot of String columns, I noticed in the `perf-top`
    and flame graphs that we can spend around 20-40% of query execution time on strings
    deserialization. I knew that string deserialization place was already heavily
    optimized in ClickHouse, but I decided to dig deeper.

    you check the `DB::deserializeBinarySSE2` assembly, you can notice that the PODArray
