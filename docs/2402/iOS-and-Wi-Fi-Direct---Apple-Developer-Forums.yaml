    already, is that correct?

    a Lightning connector. Peer-to-peer Wi-Fi support is not *tied* to the Lightning
    connector, it''s just a helpful coincidence that the hardware that supports peer-to-peer
    Wi-Fi also happens to have a Lightning connector and thus it''s an easy way to
    identify that support.'

    with non-Apple hardware is more challenging because the peer-to-peer networking
    protocols (both Wi-Fi and Bluetooth) are not documented for third-party use.

- en: In a typical home accessory setup you want the accessory to join the same infrastructure
    Wi-Fi as all the other devices in the home. Apple explicitly supports this via
    the Wireless Accessory Configuration (WAC) mechanism. This lets an iOS device
    pass its Wi-Fi configuration to the accessory so that the accessory can join the
    same Wi-Fi network as the iOS device is currently on.

    You can generally make things work, but it tends to be a manual process.
