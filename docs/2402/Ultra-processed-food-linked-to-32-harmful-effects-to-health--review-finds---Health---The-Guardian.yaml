- en: Ultra-processed food (UPF) is directly linked to 32 harmful effects to health,
    including a higher risk of heart disease, cancer, type 2 diabetes, adverse mental
    health and early death, according to the world’s largest review of its kind.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The findings from the first comprehensive umbrella review of evidence come amid
    rapidly rising global consumption of UPF such as cereals, protein bars, fizzy
    drinks, ready meals and fast food.

    food. For some, especially people who are younger, poorer or from disadvantaged
    areas, a diet comprising as much as 80% UPF is typical.

    sugary cereals, and ready-to-eat or ready meals, undergo multiple industrial processes
    and often contain colours, emulsifiers, flavours and other additives. These products

    had yet provided a broad assessment of the evidence in this area.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    evidence summary – of 45 distinct pooled meta-analyses from 14 review articles
    associating UPF with adverse health outcomes.

    of food frequency questionnaires, 24-hour dietary recalls, and dietary history

    a 50% increased risk of cardiovascular disease-related death, a 48 to 53% higher
