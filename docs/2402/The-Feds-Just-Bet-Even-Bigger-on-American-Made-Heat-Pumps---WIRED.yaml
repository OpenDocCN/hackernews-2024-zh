    to cut carbon emissions, a technological hero has been rapidly ascending under
    the radar: [the heat pump](https://www.wired.com/story/why-you-the-planet-need-heat-pump/).
    Instead of burning natural gas or coal to produce heat, this fully electric device
    extracts warmth from [outdoor air](https://www.greenbiz.com/article/cost-effective-new-study-confirms-heat-pump-efficiency-freezing-temperatures)—even
    when it’s freezing outside—and pumps it inside to warm a structure. After years
    of stealthy, steady growth, [heat pumps](https://www.wired.com/tag/heat-pumps/)
    are [now outselling gas furnaces](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/heat-pumps/chart-americans-bought-more-heat-pumps-than-gas-furnaces-last-year)
    in the United States, whereas [EVs accounted](https://www.wired.com/story/ev-sales-hit-a-record-in-the-us-now-their-popularity-may-be-waning/)
    for just [8 percent](https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/06/business/americans-bought-1-million-electric-this-year/index.html)
    of all US new vehicle sales in the first half of 2023.'

    heat pump industry with [$169 million in federal funding](https://www.wired.com/story/you-need-a-heat-pump-soon-youll-have-more-american-made-options/),
    increasing capacity to manufacture the actual devices and their various components,
    like compressors. The feds figured that would end up creating 1,700 jobs across
    13 states. Seeing still more momentum for heat pump adoption since then, the Department
    of Energy is today announcing an additional $63 million for the same purpose.
    This time around, the money also emphasizes heat pumps for heating and cooling
    water in a home.

    possible, working toward residences going fully electric. “We’re really seeing,
    I think, a sea change across the country in terms of how people heat and cool
    their homes,” says Ali Zaidi, assistant to the president and national climate
    adviser. “For a really long time, we had been staring at the building sector,
    wondering if we could find the widget to decarbonize our homes and the places
    that we work. We found that tool.”

    if you’re forced to power one with a grid running on fossil fuels, you’re still
    better off. According to [one estimate](https://carbonswitch.com/heat-pump-carbon-reduction-and-savings-potential-report/),
    switching to a heat pump will save the average American household over $550 a
    year. The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 [provides thousands of dollars](https://www.wired.com/story/how-inflation-reduction-act-climate-bill-save-you-money/)
    for a household to switch to a heat pump, in the form of tax credits or rebates.

    the Defense Production Act—a long-standing piece of legislation that grants the
    president the power to ensure the supply of materials needed for national defense.
    It’s being invoked here on the basis of climate change in particular. “As part
    of the Biden-Harris administration’s commitment to address the climate crisis,
    these Defense Production Act dollars will further amp up domestic heat pump manufacturing
    to meet increasing consumer excitement, reduce emissions, and create clean energy
    jobs across the country,” wrote US secretary of energy Jennifer M. Granholm in
    a statement provided to WIRED.

    so you can run them on a grid increasingly powered by renewables like wind and
    solar, themselves ideally manufactured in the US. Reducing emissions by decarbonizing
    buildings with heat pumps will also slow climate change, reducing the severity
    of increasingly destructive [wildfires](https://www.wired.com/story/wildfires-used-to-be-helpful-how-did-they-get-so-hellish/),

    impossible to decouple,” says Zaidi. “The real basis here is to recognize that
    our national security flows through solutions that reduce our dependence on fossil
    fuels.”

    the domestic production of whole heat pumps and their individual components provides
    a range of jobs. Individual states, too, are working feverishly to increase adoption
    and bolster the industry: Just last week, [nine of them](https://www.wired.com/story/these-states-are-basically-begging-you-to-get-a-heat-pump/)
    pledged to get heat pumps to account for 90 percent of residential heating, air
    conditioning, and water-heating shipments by 2040.'

    and still more trained technicians to install the things across the country. To
    that end, this new funding allows applicants to propose using a portion of the
    money to develop their manufacturing facility workforce as they expand production.
    “We feel really confident that we’re continuing to invest not only in the capacity
    to make this stuff,” says Zaidi, “but to deploy it in a way that spurs really
    good-paying jobs across the country.”
