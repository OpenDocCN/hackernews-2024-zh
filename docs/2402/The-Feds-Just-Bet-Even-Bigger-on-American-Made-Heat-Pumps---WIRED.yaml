  zh: 虽然大家一直致力于推动电动车的普及以减少碳排放，但在幕后，一个技术英雄正迅速崛起：[热泵](https://www.wired.com/story/why-you-the-planet-need-heat-pump/)。这种全电动设备不再使用天然气或煤炭来加热，而是从[室外空气](https://www.greenbiz.com/article/cost-effective-new-study-confirms-heat-pump-efficiency-freezing-temperatures)中提取热量——即使外面温度酷寒——然后将其泵入室内以供暖。经过多年的悄无声息和稳定增长，[热泵](https://www.wired.com/tag/heat-pumps/)如今在美国销量已超过燃气炉，而[电动车](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/heat-pumps/chart-americans-bought-more-heat-pumps-than-gas-furnaces-last-year)在2023年上半年仅占所有美国新车销售的[8

    heat pump industry with [$169 million in federal funding](https://www.wired.com/story/you-need-a-heat-pump-soon-youll-have-more-american-made-options/),
    increasing capacity to manufacture the actual devices and their various components,
    like compressors. The feds figured that would end up creating 1,700 jobs across
    13 states. Seeing still more momentum for heat pump adoption since then, the Department
    of Energy is today announcing an additional $63 million for the same purpose.
    This time around, the money also emphasizes heat pumps for heating and cooling
    water in a home.

  zh: 十一月份，拜登政府宣布将向国内热泵行业注入[1.69亿美元的联邦资金](https://www.wired.com/story/you-need-a-heat-pump-soon-youll-have-more-american-made-options/)，增加制造这些设备及其各种组件（如压缩机）的能力。联邦政府预计这将在13个州创造1,700个工作岗位。随着热泵采用势头的进一步增强，能源部今天宣布再次拨款6300万美元。这一次，资金还强调了用于家庭供暖和冷却水的热泵。
- en: Basically, the federal funding is aiming to nix the use of gas in a home wherever
    possible, working toward residences going fully electric. “We’re really seeing,
    I think, a sea change across the country in terms of how people heat and cool
    their homes,” says Ali Zaidi, assistant to the president and national climate
    adviser. “For a really long time, we had been staring at the building sector,
    wondering if we could find the widget to decarbonize our homes and the places
    that we work. We found that tool.”

- en: The humble heat pump is so much more efficient than a gas furnace that even
    if you’re forced to power one with a grid running on fossil fuels, you’re still
    better off. According to [one estimate](https://carbonswitch.com/heat-pump-carbon-reduction-and-savings-potential-report/),
    switching to a heat pump will save the average American household over $550 a
    year. The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 [provides thousands of dollars](https://www.wired.com/story/how-inflation-reduction-act-climate-bill-save-you-money/)
    for a household to switch to a heat pump, in the form of tax credits or rebates.

- en: Like with the first round of funding last year, the administration is invoking
    the Defense Production Act—a long-standing piece of legislation that grants the
    president the power to ensure the supply of materials needed for national defense.
    It’s being invoked here on the basis of climate change in particular. “As part
    of the Biden-Harris administration’s commitment to address the climate crisis,
    these Defense Production Act dollars will further amp up domestic heat pump manufacturing
    to meet increasing consumer excitement, reduce emissions, and create clean energy
    jobs across the country,” wrote US secretary of energy Jennifer M. Granholm in
    a statement provided to WIRED.
