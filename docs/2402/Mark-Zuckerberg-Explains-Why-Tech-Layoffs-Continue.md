# Mark Zuckerberg Explains Why Tech Layoffs Continue

> 来源：[https://www.businessinsider.com/mark-zuckerberg-comments-tech-company-layoffs-2024-2](https://www.businessinsider.com/mark-zuckerberg-comments-tech-company-layoffs-2024-2)

## The first wave

During the pandemic, e-commerce sales went through the roof, which drove big gains in online advertising. But as people returned to stores and the economy adjusted, sales growth ebbed and ad rates returned to Earth. Many companies, including Meta, realized they had over-hired and had to make major cuts.

That was the first wave of layoffs.

"In terms of the layoffs and stuff like that, I actually think that was more due to companies trying to navigate COVID," Zuckerberg said in the interview when asked if tech layoffs had to do with the AI boom.

## What comes next

Zuckerberg said that companies are no longer shrinking their employee size simply because of overhiring — they're now realizing there can be benefits to being leaner.

While many tech companies were initially reluctant to make cuts, they realized it didn't spell the end, Zuckerberg said.

"It was obviously really tough, we parted with a lot of talented people we cared about," Zuckerberg said in the interview, speaking specifically about Meta's past layoffs. "But in some ways actually becoming leaner kind of makes the company more effective."

Since Meta cut tens of thousands of its staff starting with Zuckerberg's ["year of efficiency,"](https://www.businessinsider.com/mark-zuckerberg-year-of-efficiency-working-meta-ai-2023-7) the company has been [making a comeback](https://www.businessinsider.com/meta-layoffs-office-closures-stock-price-mark-zuckerberg-earnings-2024-2), with its stock at an all-time high.

## Fewer management layers

Zuckerberg has been chopping management layers as part of this efficiency drive. [Instagram](https://www.businessinsider.com/instagram-cuts-technical-program-managers-reinterview-for-pm-roles-2024-1) is eliminating [technical-program managers](https://www.businessinsider.com/meta-layoffs-tpm-roles-instagram-job-cuts) and that role is also being cut back across other parts of Meta.

Meta didn't respond to Business Insider's request for comment.

Companies are still in the mode of thinking about efficiency, Zuckerberg said during the Morning Brew podcast. Many are considering restructuring the company, flattening out management levels, and transitioning to leaner models.

Companies such as Microsoft and Google have continued to downsize despite solid earnings. A number of CEOs at companies such as Amazon have mentioned plans to [re](https://www.businessinsider.com/meta-layoffs-tpm-roles-instagram-job-cuts)[structure the company](https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-layoffs) and invest in areas with AI.

But Zuckerberg said that he didn't think AI was a big part of the equation.

"At least for us, the AI stuff was not a major driver for that," he said. "It was like first this overbuilding and then this sense of like let's do the best work we can by making a lean company."

## Apple competition

Zuckerberg also spoke about Meta's intense rivalry with Apple. Zuckerberg and [Tim Cook](https://www.businessinsider.com/tim-cook), the CEO of Apple, have a feud [going back several years](https://www.businessinsider.com/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-inflict-pain-apple-wsj-2021-2). And the companies are racing to become the dominant platform for virtual reality, augmented reality, and what Apple calls "spatial computing."

Earlier this week, [Zuckerberg panned Apple's Vision Pro](https://www.businessinsider.com/mark-zuckerberg-rips-apple-vision-pro-2024-2) goggles in a review posted online.

"I take Apple seriously," he said during the Morning Brew podcast. "I think it's like a good company. They do good work."

Zuckerberg said Apple will likely improve its headset, but Meta will probably move faster.

He also looked back at the history of computing and described how closed platforms such as Apple's iOS sometimes won.

"But that's not always how it works," Zuckerberg said, noting that Microsoft's open approach to personal computers won out in the 1990s.

"I just don't think that the future is written on this yet," he said.
