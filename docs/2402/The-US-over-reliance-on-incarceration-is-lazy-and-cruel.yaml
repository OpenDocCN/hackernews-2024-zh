- en: The United States ranks 1st in the world for [incarcerated population](https://www.prisonstudies.org/highest-to-lowest/prison-population-total?field_region_taxonomy_tid=All)
    and 5th for [incarceration rate](https://www.prisonstudies.org/highest-to-lowest/prison_population_rate?field_region_taxonomy_tid=All).
    The nation in 2nd place for population holds the 129th position for rate, imprisoning
    1/5th as many people per capita. Which is this freedom-loving nation with, both
    absolutely and relatively, fewer prisoners than the US? China. The “land of the
    free” is more likely to imprison you than a regime so brutal that it has concentration
    camps.

    Cassidy](https://reason.com/2024/02/12/brickbat-sympathy-for-the-devil/). He “dismantled”
    the Baphomet Altar in the Iowa State Capitol, doing up to [$1,500](https://www.polkcountyiowa.gov/county-attorney/news/mississippi-man-charged-with-third-degree-criminal-mischief-in-violation-of-individual-rights/)
    worth of damage. His maximum possible sentence, given that this was religiously
    motivated and therefore a hate-crime, is five years.

    per year. Per that standard, Mr. Cassidy could face $250,000 worth of penalty
    (excluding fines) for $1,500 worth of crime. This is not justice.

    terms of working off his debt. With a federal minimum wage of $7.25 per hour,
    he’d have to work two-hundred and seven hours to repay the victim. That’s just
    over five weeks, not years.

    Per the [Harvard Political Review](https://harvardpolitics.com/recidivism-american-progress/),
    “Norway has one of the [lowest recidivism rates](https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/articles/2019-02-22/inspired-by-norways-approach-north-dakota-reforms-its-prisons)
    in the world at **20%**. The U.S. has [one of the highest](http://www.nij.gov/topics/corrections/recidivism/Pages/welcome.aspx):
    **76.6%** of prisoners are rearrested within five years.”'

    more than one quarter the recidivism rate of the US. They also sentence criminals
    to dramatically shorter times in vastly more civilized prisons. Where the US’
    approach to justice is [retributive](https://open.substack.com/pub/obviatethestate/p/retributivism-is-a-failed-philosophy?r=2m6i0s&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web&showWelcomeOnShare=true),
    Norway’s is restorative. Rehabilitating prisoners is, in every respect, vastly
    better than treating them like animals.

- en: It’s incredibly unlikely that Mr. Cassidy will be given the maximum sentence
    but that possibility should not exist at all. It exemplifies the casual cruelty
    with which the United States pursues justice. In the span of five years I married,
    started a successful business, and welcomed two wonderful children to the world.
    Would you take all that life from me for damaging someone’s property? Would you
    willingly bear the same penalty for one misdeed?
