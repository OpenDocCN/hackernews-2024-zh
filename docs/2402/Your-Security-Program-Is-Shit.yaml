    identity stolen and is now on the hook for $100k worth of Ethcoin or whatever
    the fuck those things are called knows it, and your ~~computer nerd with a little
    bit of charisma~~ CISO knows it, too. Everyone in this industry loves to pretend
    otherwise, and we all knowingly and willingly keep the charade going. Why is that?

    profession if you''re not directly involved with the operational aspects of infosec.
    If you''re directly involved with the operational aspects of infosec, you''re
    probably too overworked and too underpaid to actively participate in this circus.
    But, if you''re *not*... The whole world is your stage.'

    the ~~director for all intents and purposes~~ CISO of a, let''s see, hospital.
    Your employer enjoys a near monopoly in your region, your clientele is not made
    up of folks who have much of a choice when they need the services you provide,
    and cybersecurity is not something they''re particularly worried about. Sure,
    you have HIPAA and shit like that, but I''d be hard pressed to come up with a
    single example of average hospital goers who pick their healthcare providers based
    on cybersecurity maturity levels. "Help me! I got shot! Just don''t take me to
    St. Mary of the Immaculate Fucks. Their SOC 2 had a *qualified* opinion!"'

    I don't know what the fuck that is, I don't care what the fuck that is, and I
    wouldn't give a shit about any of this were this not tied to my bonus. Here's
    ten dollars. Go see to it." You relay that message to your Gee Arrr Cee director
    (manager, functionally), and tell them to get it done. The ~~barely manager~~
    director tells his managers (administrative assistants whose only form of managerial
    autonomy is approving PTO) to do a gAp AnAlYsIs, and assigns a project manager
    (lol) to "help."

    other attempt by the project manager (sic) to Agile-ify shit not meant to be Agile,
    your team comes back to you with the news that shit's not looking so good. Not
    a *single fucking control* required by the standard is being met, there's no way
    in hell this company can get certified, and they have the receipts.

    Of Experience says in this report that I didn''t really read beyond page 3\. What
    the fuck does this gal know anyway? If she was any good, she''d be director (manager)
    by now. You know what? Let''s get a second opinion: get Deloitte on the horn!
    Hello? Deloitte? I need a "gap analysis" and a "ISO 27001 readiness consulting"
    pronto! 5 million dollars? Of course! That''s the price of quality, knowledge,
    and expertise! A CPA with zero knowledge of technology in general or the things
    we use in particular is going to be here tomorrow? Fantastic. Their opinion is
    much more valuable than some individual contributor fuck who knows our shit inside
    out and has been here for 10 years. If they were any good, they''d be charging
    $5mil, and not the $78k/year we pay them. In fact, the Deloitte CPA''s opinion
    is about 65 times more valuable, because $78k times 65 is about $5mil.'

    to go, bitches. Fuck those individual contributors contrarians. Deloitte > Our
    Cybersec Fucks. Get me some ISO certifying company that sources their auditors

    spell ISO, pronto!

    they're talking about, you pretend like you know what you're talking about, the
    people who actually do work are taken from their already busy day to participate
    in your little theater and try to explain what a CI/CD pipeline even is to a complete
    moron, you get your certificate, the auditor gets paid, the certifying company
    gets paid *even more*, Deloitte makes $5mil while having zero at stake, and everyone's
    happy. You bring your brand new certificate to your boss, y'all send a mass email
    patting yourselves on the back, you get a bonus and a promotion to CISO II (senior
    director), and Ms. Analyst With Technical Background And Twenty Years Of Experience
    gets a "Below expectations" performance review, gets put on a PIP, fails the PIP
    because PIPs are just "firing your ass with extra steps", and is now unemployed
    because she's a party pooper.

- en: Your security program sucks because it's very similar to this one. The people
    who should know better don't give a shit, the opinions of an external idiot are
    more valuable than the opinions of the internal smart people, your CISO can't
    read a log to save his life but keeps getting promoted, and your rank and file
    are penalized for doing the right thing that just so happens to make the CISO
    look bad. They'll give $5mil to someone who's going to tell them what they want
    to hear (for $5mil I would, too), and they'll get rid of the people who tell the
    truth for $78k/yr.
