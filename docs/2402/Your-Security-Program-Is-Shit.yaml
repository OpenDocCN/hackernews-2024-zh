    identity stolen and is now on the hook for $100k worth of Ethcoin or whatever
    the fuck those things are called knows it, and your ~~computer nerd with a little
    bit of charisma~~ CISO knows it, too. Everyone in this industry loves to pretend
    otherwise, and we all knowingly and willingly keep the charade going. Why is that?

    the ~~director for all intents and purposes~~ CISO of a, let''s see, hospital.
    Your employer enjoys a near monopoly in your region, your clientele is not made
    up of folks who have much of a choice when they need the services you provide,
    and cybersecurity is not something they''re particularly worried about. Sure,
    you have HIPAA and shit like that, but I''d be hard pressed to come up with a
    single example of average hospital goers who pick their healthcare providers based
    on cybersecurity maturity levels. "Help me! I got shot! Just don''t take me to
    St. Mary of the Immaculate Fucks. Their SOC 2 had a *qualified* opinion!"'

  zh: 为了论证，让我们想象一个非常常见的情景：你是一家医院的CISO。你的雇主在你所在地几乎垄断市场，你的客户群体在需要你提供服务时并没有太多选择的余地，并且他们并不特别担心网络安全问题。当然，你有HIPAA之类的东西，但我很难想出一个普通的医院顾客会基于网络安全成熟度选择他们的医疗服务提供商的例子。“救命！我中枪了！千万别带我去什么圣玛丽亚无瑕的妈妈。他们的SOC
    2有一个*合格的*意见！”

    ten dollars. Go see to it." You relay that message to your Gee Arrr Cee director
    (manager, functionally), and tell them to get it done. The ~~barely manager~~
    director tells his managers (administrative assistants whose only form of managerial
    autonomy is approving PTO) to do a gAp AnAlYsIs, and assigns a project manager

    by now. You know what? Let''s get a second opinion: get Deloitte on the horn!
    Hello? Deloitte? I need a "gap analysis" and a "ISO 27001 readiness consulting"
    pronto! 5 million dollars? Of course! That''s the price of quality, knowledge,
    and expertise! A CPA with zero knowledge of technology in general or the things
    we use in particular is going to be here tomorrow? Fantastic. Their opinion is
    much more valuable than some individual contributor fuck who knows our shit inside
    out and has been here for 10 years. If they were any good, they''d be charging
    $5mil, and not the $78k/year we pay them. In fact, the Deloitte CPA''s opinion
    is about 65 times more valuable, because $78k times 65 is about $5mil.'

    who should know better don't give a shit, the opinions of an external idiot are
    more valuable than the opinions of the internal smart people, your CISO can't
    read a log to save his life but keeps getting promoted, and your rank and file
    are penalized for doing the right thing that just so happens to make the CISO
    look bad. They'll give $5mil to someone who's going to tell them what they want
    to hear (for $5mil I would, too), and they'll get rid of the people who tell the
    truth for $78k/yr.
