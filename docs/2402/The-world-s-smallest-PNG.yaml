    use the “truecolor” type (encoded with `02`). There are three other color types
    which we don’t need today, but you can [read more about them in the PNG specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/2022/WD-png-3-20221025/#4Concepts.PNGImage).
  prefs:
  - PREF_IND
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Once you’ve picked a color type, you need to pick a bit depth. The bit depth
    depends on the color type, but usually means the number of bits per color channel
    in an image. For example, hex colors like `#FE9802` have a bit depth of eight—eight
    bits for red, eight bits for green, and eight bits for blue. Our all-black image
    doesn’t need all that&mldr;we only need *one* bit! The pixel is either completely
    black (`0`) or completely white (`1`)—in our case, it’s completely black.
  prefs:
  - PREF_IND
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If we picked a more “expressive” color type and bit depth, we could make the
    same 1×1 image visually, but the file could be bigger because there could be more
    bits per pixel that we don’t actually need. For example, if we used the “truecolor”
    type and 16 bits per channel, each pixel would require 48 bits instead of just
    one—not necessary to encode “completely black”.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    has 456 scanlines. In our case, we have just one scanline, because our image is
    just one pixel tall.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Scanlines start with something called a [filter type](https://www.w3.org/TR/2022/WD-png-3-20221025/#9Filter-types)
    which can improve compression, depending on your image. Our image is so small
    that this is irrelevant, so we use filter type 0, or “None”.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    PNG”](https://belkadan.com/blog/2024/01/The-Biggest-Smallest-PNG/) in response
    to this post. It shows the biggest 67-byte PNG: a 1×2064 black line.'

    chunk has a length, type, data, and checksum. Some chunks are always required,
    like the image header (IHDR) chunk.

    Chunk Explorer](https://evanhahn.gitlab.io/png-explorer/), which lets you analyze
    PNGs. Try uploading your own images to see what they’re made of! (It doesn’t work
    well on mobile, apologies.)

    monochromatic PNGs of arbitrary sizes. For example, you could generate a 12×34
    purple rectangle. The images should be small but I haven’t yet implemented the
    most sophisticated compression, so you might need to run its results through a
    PNG compressor to achieve the smallest sizes.

    There’s no theoretical file size limit, but there is a maximum number of pixels,
    and many decoders impose various limits.
