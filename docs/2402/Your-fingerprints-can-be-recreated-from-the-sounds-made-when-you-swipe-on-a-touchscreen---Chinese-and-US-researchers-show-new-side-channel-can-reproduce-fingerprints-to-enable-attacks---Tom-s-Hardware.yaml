    has been outlined by a group of researchers from China and the US. [PrintListener:
    Uncovering the Vulnerability of Fingerprint Authentication via the Finger Friction
    Sound](https://www.ndss-symposium.org/wp-content/uploads/2024-618-paper.pdf) [PDF]
    proposes a side-channel attack on the sophisticated Automatic Fingerprint Identification
    System ([AFIS](https://www.aratek.co/news/automated-fingerprint-identification-system-afis-an-overview)).
    The attack leverages the sound characteristics of a user’s finger swiping on a
    [touchscreen](https://www.tomshardware.com/news/nokia-lumia-iphone-ipad-touchscreen,16351.html)
    to extract fingerprint pattern features. Following tests, the researchers assert
    that they can successfully attack “up to 27.9% of partial fingerprints and 9.3%
    of complete fingerprints within five attempts at the highest security FAR [False
    Acceptance Rate] setting of 0.01%.” This is claimed to be the first work that
    leverages swiping sounds to infer fingerprint information.'

    is widespread and widely trusted. If things continue as they are, it is thought
    that the fingerprint authentication market will be worth nearly $100 billion by
    2032\. However, organizations and people have become increasingly aware that attackers
    might want to steal their fingerprints, so some have started to be careful about
    keeping their fingerprints out of sight, and become sensitive to photos showing
    their hand details.'

    get any fingerprint data to enhance MasterPrint and DeepMasterPrint dictionary
    attack results on user fingerprints? One answer is as follows: the PrintListener
    paper says that “finger-swiping friction sounds can be captured by attackers online
    with a high possibility.” The source of the finger-swiping sounds can be popular
    apps like [Discord](https://www.tomshardware.com/news/discord-throttles-nvidia-gpu-memory-clock-speeds),
    Skype, WeChat, [FaceTime](https://www.tomshardware.com/news/apple-facetime-glitch-bug-eavesdropping-lawsuit,38527.html),
    etc. Any chatty app where users carelessly perform swiping actions on the screen
    while the device mic is live. Hence the side-channel attack name – PrintListener.'

- en: To prove the theory, the scientists practically developed their attack research
    as PrintListener. In brief, PrintListener uses a series of algorithms for pre-processing
    the raw [audio signals](https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/artificial-intelligence/audacity-gets-ai-transcription-and-noise-suppression-courtesy-of-intel-openvino-plug-ins)
    which are then used to generate targeted synthetics for PatternMasterPrint (the
    MasterPrint generated by fingerprints with a specific pattern).

    scenarios,” and, as mentioned in the intro, can facilitate successful partial
    fingerprint attacks in better than one in four cases, and complete fingerprint
    attacks in nearly one in ten cases. These results far exceed unaided MasterPrint
    fingerprint dictionary attacks.
