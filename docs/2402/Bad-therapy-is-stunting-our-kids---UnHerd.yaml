- en: '*Bad Therapy* argues further that therapeutic parenting has coincided with
    an explosion of psychic distress at home and bad behaviour in schools: “Kids having
    utter meltdowns, tantrums, screaming, yelling, throwing things, crying, threatening
    to kill themselves” in “a school regime that demands no self-discipline from students,
    believing such expectation unreasonable if not unevolved”. In this authority-free
    regime, playground violence goes unpunished save through “restorative justice”,
    in which attacker and victim sit in a circle and talk about their feelings. The
    result, in extremis, is violent young people left at large, until sometimes —
    as in the case of the “Parkland shooter” — they kill.'

    institutional empathy. From girls ostracised at expensive private high schools
    for causing “harm” with a careless social media post, to the adolescents screenshotting
    their peers’ “problematic” online utterances as ammunition for future interpersonal
    conflicts, Shrier describes this superficially cuddly culture with cold anger,
    as “corruption of character” and “sustained flirtation with evil”.

- en: '*Bad Therapy* paints a grim picture of young people simultaneously under- and
    over-parented. Of adults who both want to be involved in every detail of their
    children’s lives but who shrink from being seen as authority figures while they
    do so, preferring to be their child’s “best friend”. Why is this happening? Why
    are we Gen X “[latchkey kids”](https://daily.jstor.org/latchkey-generation-bad/),
    left to fend for ourselves while both parents worked, so fearful either of taking
    an authoritative stance with our own children, or of seeing them experience the
    slightest discomfort or obstacle?'

- en: '*Bad Therapy* is a work of cultural criticism, not social history. But in Shrier’s
    view, close to the heart of the so-called “youth mental health crisis” is Gen
    X and Millennial parents’ aversion to being the symbolic — and literal— Father
    for their children. Instead, she argues, anxious “gentle parents” hover with platitudes
    about “big feelings” while their toddlers screech and bite, or defer to experts
    when their teenagers are struggling. These parents reject the “more masculine
    style of parenting” Shrier characterises as “knock it off, shake it off” — an
    approach that rebuked misbehaviour briskly, and expected minor setbacks to be
    dismissed. Instead “all traces of tough love and rule-bound parenting have been
    supplanted by a more empathetic style, the one once associated with moms.”'

- en: Less explicitly spelled out is the way the same dynamic has also outsourced
    mothering — and opened the door to its replacement by what Jordan Peterson calls
    the “dark mother” or “devouring mother”. For Freud, this “Oedipal mother” stood
    in contrast with the “good mother” who, for Freud, “necessarily fails” at nurturing,
    thus setting the child on a path to independence. Instead of setting her children
    free, though, the devouring Oedipal mother keeps them tightly enmeshed forever.

- en: The plot twist, in the therapeutic childrearing and educational cultures excoriated
    by Shrier in *Bad Therapy*, is that today this dark mother is not an individual
    but a set of institutions, norms, and practices. For, as *Bad Therapy* argues,
    it’s less that these unhappy children are tied to their literal mothers’ apron
    strings, than that they’re enveloped by the devouring mother of institutional
    “care”. Over time, it can end up displacing literal and symbolic parents of both
    sexes.

    X and Millennial parents allowed themselves to be persuaded that the way forward
    was deferring to paid parenting “experts” — and, in return for ceding authority,
    hoped their kids would like them. Except, as it turns out, it’s had the opposite
    effect: children don’t like their parents more for being needy and permissive.
    Nor are they even freer, but — often — simply more radical. Shrier draws a straight
    line from the loss of authority in parenting to political extremism, noting that
    extremist movements from BLM to the far-Right often attract young people from
    homes where authoritative guidance is lacking. She quotes Myrieme Nadri-Churchill
    of the deradicalisation nonprofit Parents for Peace, who puts it starkly: “It’s
    almost like extremist groups have replaced parenting.”'

    up as: less tech, more agency, better boundaries. In her view, the first course
    of action is to remove the factors obviously making adolescents’ lives worse:
    the therapy-speak, the climate alarmism, the “hunt for repressed trauma”, the
    suffocating micromanagement, and the anxious reluctance to allow children to develop
    independence. Crucially, she argues that the most obvious intervention of all
    for improved youth mental health is not more institutional devouring Mother, but
    an authoritative “no” by the symbolic Father: specifically, banning smartphones
    from schools.'

    manage fine with flip phones. They aren’t weaker than you — unless you make them
    so.” She leaves the question implicit: are you Father enough to hold the line?
    We can perhaps infer from *Bad Therapy* that if anyone needs (good) therapy it’s
    not the kids but their parents — most centrally, in making peace with the symbolic
    Father. For if Shrier is correct, my generation has killed him — only to turn
    away from being the hero who takes his place. In his stead, we’ve enthroned a
    faceless, institutional devouring mother.'

    is to make peace with the necessity, as Freud put it, of failing as real mothers.
    In any case, grappling with our own anxieties and disappointments as adults and
    parents is easier said than done, as Shrier acknowledges. She describes how effortful
    she finds it to grant her own children increasing access to independence.

    fears: about harm to children, about failing as nurturers, about being hated for
    saying “no”. What is preventing Gen X from doing so? Perhaps the “latchkey generation”
    carries more childhood wounds than we realise.'
