- en: '*Bad Therapy* argues further that therapeutic parenting has coincided with
    an explosion of psychic distress at home and bad behaviour in schools: “Kids having
    utter meltdowns, tantrums, screaming, yelling, throwing things, crying, threatening
    to kill themselves” in “a school regime that demands no self-discipline from students,
    believing such expectation unreasonable if not unevolved”. In this authority-free
    regime, playground violence goes unpunished save through “restorative justice”,
    in which attacker and victim sit in a circle and talk about their feelings. The
    result, in extremis, is violent young people left at large, until sometimes —
    as in the case of the “Parkland shooter” — they kill.'

  zh: '*不良的治疗*进一步认为，治疗式的家长模式与家庭的心理困扰激增和学校中的糟糕行为并发。学校里的“孩子完全崩溃，发脾气，尖叫，大喊，扔东西，哭泣，威胁要自杀”，在“学校制度对学生不要求自律，认为这样的期望不合理甚至是未开化”的状况下。在这种无权威的制度下，操场上的暴力行为得到了无人惩罚，除非通过“恢复性正义”，攻击者和受害者坐在一圈里谈论他们的感觉。结果就是，极端情况下，暴力的未成年人接着到处闲荡，有时——就像“帕克兰射击手”一样——他们会杀人。'
- en: Even the ones who aren’t violent are learning to be “mean as hell” — by weaponising
    institutional empathy. From girls ostracised at expensive private high schools
    for causing “harm” with a careless social media post, to the adolescents screenshotting
    their peers’ “problematic” online utterances as ammunition for future interpersonal
    conflicts, Shrier describes this superficially cuddly culture with cold anger,
    as “corruption of character” and “sustained flirtation with evil”.

- en: '*Bad Therapy* paints a grim picture of young people simultaneously under- and
    over-parented. Of adults who both want to be involved in every detail of their
    children’s lives but who shrink from being seen as authority figures while they
    do so, preferring to be their child’s “best friend”. Why is this happening? Why
    are we Gen X “[latchkey kids”](https://daily.jstor.org/latchkey-generation-bad/),

    an authoritative stance with our own children, or of seeing them experience the

- en: '*Bad Therapy* is a work of cultural criticism, not social history. But in Shrier’s
    view, close to the heart of the so-called “youth mental health crisis” is Gen
    X and Millennial parents’ aversion to being the symbolic — and literal— Father
    for their children. Instead, she argues, anxious “gentle parents” hover with platitudes
    about “big feelings” while their toddlers screech and bite, or defer to experts
    when their teenagers are struggling. These parents reject the “more masculine
    style of parenting” Shrier characterises as “knock it off, shake it off” — an
    approach that rebuked misbehaviour briskly, and expected minor setbacks to be
    dismissed. Instead “all traces of tough love and rule-bound parenting have been
    supplanted by a more empathetic style, the one once associated with moms.”'

  zh: '*不良的治疗*是一部文化批评作品，而不是社会史。但在Shrier看来，所谓的“青少年心理健康危机”的核心是X世代和千禧一代的父母对成为他们孩子象征意义的
    —— 和字面意义上的 —— 父亲的恐惧。相反，她认为，充满焦虑的“温和的家长”在他们的幼儿尖叫和咬人时，常用“对大的感触”而悬置，或者在他们的青少年陷入困境时遵从专家。这些家长拒绝了Shrier所描述的“更男性化的育儿方式”，她认为这是“打住，摆正”的方式，这种方式会迅速斥责不当的行为，并期望轻微挫折可以被解决。而是“所有痕迹的严厉爱和规则性的育儿方式已被更富有同理心的风格所取代，而这种风格曾与母亲有关”'
- en: Less explicitly spelled out is the way the same dynamic has also outsourced
    mothering — and opened the door to its replacement by what Jordan Peterson calls
    the “dark mother” or “devouring mother”. For Freud, this “Oedipal mother” stood
    in contrast with the “good mother” who, for Freud, “necessarily fails” at nurturing,
    thus setting the child on a path to independence. Instead of setting her children
    free, though, the devouring Oedipal mother keeps them tightly enmeshed forever.

  zh: 同样的动态模式还外包了母性，并打开了由乔丹·彼得森所称的“黑暗母亲”或“消耗性母亲”的代替之门。对于弗洛伊德来说，这个“俄狄浦斯的母亲”与他所说的那个“必然失败”没有培育的“好母亲”形成鲜明对比，这是将孩子设置在独立的道路上。然而，这个母亲并没有把她的孩子们释放出去，而是把他们永远紧密地缠绕在一起。
- en: The plot twist, in the therapeutic childrearing and educational cultures excoriated
    by Shrier in *Bad Therapy*, is that today this dark mother is not an individual
    but a set of institutions, norms, and practices. For, as *Bad Therapy* argues,
    it’s less that these unhappy children are tied to their literal mothers’ apron
    strings, than that they’re enveloped by the devouring mother of institutional
    “care”. Over time, it can end up displacing literal and symbolic parents of both
    sexes.

  zh: 在Shrier在*不良治疗*中抨击的治疗式的养育和教育文化中还未能明确指出的一点是，今天这种黑暗的母亲不再是个体，而变成了一套制度、规范和实践。因为正如*不良的治疗*所认为的，这些不幸的孩子与他们的真实母亲的围裙带相连，而是被消耗性的“关爱”所包围。久而久之，它最终取代了双性别的象征化父母。
- en: 'Shrier doesn’t speculate as to why or how. But somewhere along the way, Gen
    X and Millennial parents allowed themselves to be persuaded that the way forward
    was deferring to paid parenting “experts” — and, in return for ceding authority,
    hoped their kids would like them. Except, as it turns out, it’s had the opposite
    effect: children don’t like their parents more for being needy and permissive.
    Nor are they even freer, but — often — simply more radical. Shrier draws a straight
    line from the loss of authority in parenting to political extremism, noting that
    extremist movements from BLM to the far-Right often attract young people from
    homes where authoritative guidance is lacking. She quotes Myrieme Nadri-Churchill
    of the deradicalisation nonprofit Parents for Peace, who puts it starkly: “It’s
    almost like extremist groups have replaced parenting.”'

  zh: Shrier不揣测原因或方式。但是在某个地方，X世代和千禧一代的父母们允许自己被说服，认为前进的道路是听从有偿育儿“专家”的建议，并希望他们的孩子会喜欢他们。然而，事实证明，这产生了相反的效果：孩子们不会因为父母需要和过于宽容而更喜欢他们。他们也不会更加自由，而往往只是更极端。
    Shrier直接将育儿权威的丧失与政治极端主义联系起来，指出从BLM到极右派的极端主义运动往往吸引缺乏权威指导的年轻人。她引用了反极端主义非营利组织“父母为和平”（Parents
    for Peace）的Myrieme Nadri-Churchill的话：“极端组织几乎取代了育儿。”
- en: 'What, then, is to be done? The book’s central message could perhaps be summed
    up as: less tech, more agency, better boundaries. In her view, the first course
    of action is to remove the factors obviously making adolescents’ lives worse:
    the therapy-speak, the climate alarmism, the “hunt for repressed trauma”, the
    suffocating micromanagement, and the anxious reluctance to allow children to develop
    independence. Crucially, she argues that the most obvious intervention of all
    for improved youth mental health is not more institutional devouring Mother, but
    an authoritative “no” by the symbolic Father: specifically, banning smartphones
    from schools.'

  zh: 那么，应该做什么呢？这本书的核心信息或许可以用一句话总结：少一些科技，多一些自主，更好的界限。在她看来，第一步是消除显然让青少年生活变糟糕的因素：治疗用语、气候恐慌、“对压抑创伤的追求”、令人窒息的微观管理，以及对孩子发展独立性的焦虑不愿。至关重要的是，她认为对改善青少年心理健康最明显的干预不是更多机构侵吞母亲，而是象征性父亲的权威的“不”：具体来说，禁止学校使用智能手机。
- en: 'But this would mean employing the very authority that makes Gen X wince. “Teens
    manage fine with flip phones. They aren’t weaker than you — unless you make them
    so.” She leaves the question implicit: are you Father enough to hold the line?
    We can perhaps infer from *Bad Therapy* that if anyone needs (good) therapy it’s
    not the kids but their parents — most centrally, in making peace with the symbolic
    Father. For if Shrier is correct, my generation has killed him — only to turn
    away from being the hero who takes his place. In his stead, we’ve enthroned a
    faceless, institutional devouring mother.'

  zh: 但这意味着雇用让X世代退缩的权威。 “青少年用翻盖手机也能应付得来。除非你让他们如此，他们并不比你弱。”她隐含了这个问题：你够做父亲吗？也许我们可以从《坏治疗》中推断出，如果有人需要（好）治疗，那不是孩子，而是他们的父母——最重要的是，与象征性父亲和解。因为如果Shrier是正确的，我的一代已经将他杀死了——只是转身不再是取代他的英雄。在他的位置上，我们尊崇了一个无脸无身的机构侵吞母亲。
- en: And perhaps, again, the only way to escape this dark, smothering pseudo-mother
    is to make peace with the necessity, as Freud put it, of failing as real mothers.
    In any case, grappling with our own anxieties and disappointments as adults and
    parents is easier said than done, as Shrier acknowledges. She describes how effortful
    she finds it to grant her own children increasing access to independence.

- en: 'Nonetheless, she argues, it’s on parents to do battle with our own deep-seated
    fears: about harm to children, about failing as nurturers, about being hated for
