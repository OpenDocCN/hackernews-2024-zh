    a paper out of the University of Cambridge has suggested baking in remote kill
    switches and lockouts, like those developed to stop the unauthorized launch of
    nuclear weapons, into the hardware that powers it.

    makes the case that regulating the hardware these models rely on may be the best
    way to prevent its misuse.

    another arms race, like the one triggered by the missile gap controversy, where
    erroneous reports led to massive build up of ballistic missiles. While valuable,

    the performance of accelerators sold to China. But, as we've previously reported,
    while these efforts have made it harder for countries like China to get their
    hands on American chips, they are far from perfect.

    registry for AI chip sales that would track them over the course of their lifecycle,
    even after they've left their country of origin. Such a registry, they suggest,
    could incorporate a unique identifier into each chip, which could help to combat

    that such a kill switch could become a target for cybercriminals to exploit.

    from going rogue and launching a first strike. For AI however, the idea is that

    more accessible to groups unlikely to use it for evil, a concept described as
    "allocation."
