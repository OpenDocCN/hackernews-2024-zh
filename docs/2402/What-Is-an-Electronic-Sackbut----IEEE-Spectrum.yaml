- en: In 1945, [Hugh Le Caine](https://www.hughlecaine.com/en/biography.html), a physicist
    at Canada’s National Research Council, began working in his spare time on a single-channel
    musical instrument he dubbed the Electronic Sackbut. He was intrigued by the fact
    that the three auditory sensations associated with music—namely, pitch, loudness,
    and timbre—had counterparts in electronics—namely, frequency, amplitude, and the
    harmonic spectrum obtained by Fourier analysis. To demonstrate those qualities,
    Le Caine created a synthesizer that mimicked, among other things, a brass horn
    known as the sackbut. It could also synthesize other horns, as well as string
    and reed instruments. He envisioned using the electronic sackbut in live performances,
    to play orchestral, big band, and experimental jazz music.

    sackbut emerged in the 15th century, and it had a telescopic slide used to change
    pitch. It fell out of favor by the 18th century, only to be reborn as the modern-day
    trombone.

    to “afford the designer a certain measure of immunity from criticism.” That is,
    the electronic sackbut was its own invention, not an imitation of a known sound.

- en: Le Caine’s first electronic sackbut [shown at top] had all of the aesthetic
    roughness of an experimental prototype. He built it himself with whatever was
    on hand, valuing functionality over appearance. He constructed the stand out of
    pieces of packing crates, not bothering to remove staples or bits of cloth. The
    boards weren’t measured and cut to fit at nice, neat right angles. The result
    was a haphazard contraption that looked like it could collapse at any moment.
    Pencil marks with the inventor’s notations and directions remain scribbled across
    the top.

    admitted, “Confidentially, I have never made a complete drawing of the sackbut
    and have only drawn parts of it when people have asked about it.” This, of course,
    makes it difficult to describe the prototype’s electronics, especially considering
    that he kept changing them as his ideas evolved. Because it was a prototype, Le
    Caine would just clip wires and resolder components without always cleaning up
    after himself. Bill Keen, an associate of Le Caine’s at the NRC field station,
    described the instrument this way: “The components just hung out the side like
    spaghetti, and you’d just have to push them back in.”'

    worked out much of the electronic controls and described the instrument (as well
    as his other musical inventions) in her 1991 book, *The Sackbut Blues*. The original
    electronic sackbut, completed in 1948, predated the invention of transistors,
    so it used a combination of vacuum tubes, oscillators, resistors, and the occasional
    device borrowed from Le Caine’s nuclear physics lab. For example, the player’s
    right hand controlled the volume using a pressure-sensitive keyboard mounted on
    springs. The movement of the springs was converted to voltage by two condensers,
    one at each end of the keyboard. Each key was associated with a particular note,
    but the pitch of the note could be tuned by rolling back and forth on the key,
    similar to how a violinist might produce a vibrato or glissando.

    The thumb controlled the formant (that is, the amplitude peak in the spectrum
    that distinguishes the instrument’s timbre), the index finger controlled the waveform
    using a circular grid, and the three remaining fingers controlled the periodicity.

    meaningful, rich, complex, and imaginative. He wanted to overcome the popular
    perception of electronic instruments as sounding mechanical and uninteresting.
    According to Young, he wanted the electronic sackbut to be as satisfying as a
    violin, with the same nuance and variation, but easier to learn to play. Admittedly,
    I have only read about how to play the electronic sackbut, but it sounds difficult
    to learn to manipulate in a fashion that would produce a soothing sound.

    incubates. In the case of the electronic sackbut, the instrument emerged in the
    shadow of the National Research Council, Canada’s federal agency for R&D in science
    and technology, where Le Caine worked for much of his career. How did he come
    to invent this extraordinary musical instrument, and how did he convince the NRC
    to support his work?

    to electronic music, an interest he had been toying with for at least a decade.
    He considered joining the acoustics lab at NRC, until he realized they were only
    interested in measuring the properties of sound, not in the aesthetics. He also
    considered joining an equipment manufacturer, such as the Hammond Organ Co., but
    he wanted to do fundamental research rather than commercial applications. In the
    end, he opted to continue working for the NRC on various nonmusical projects,
    including the microtron, a type of particle accelerator. But he investigated electronic
    music in his spare time.

    the NRC field station southeast of Ottawa. He designated one room for all of the
    instruments he had accumulated, both traditional (piano, violin, guitar, drums)
    and experimental (homemade electronic organ and other instruments). A separate
    room was used for recording. And a final room, which also doubled as his bedroom,
    was his electronics lab, which he filled with voltmeters, oscillators, filters,
    and an oscilloscope.

    he continued working on electronic music in his spare time. Luckily, Helen Pattenson
    intervened. Pattenson was the section secretary in Le Caine’s unit, and she was
    also a member of the Scientists’ Wives’ Association. Knowing about Le Caine’s
    interest in electronic instruments, she invited him to give a talk to the association.
    Le Caine said he needed a few months to reassemble the sackbut. Pattenson then
    suggested to her supervisor, George Miller, that Le Caine be allowed to work on
    the electronic sackbut at NRC during normal business hours. Miller agreed.

    Ballard, to the lab, and Ballard also became intrigued. Eventually, they got the
    president of the NRC, [E.W.R. Steacie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edgar_Steacie),
    to look at Le Caine’s work.

    and one for the general public. He introduced the basics of electronic sound generation,
    discussed his theories about music, and demonstrated his instruments. After the
    third lecture, Steacie recommended that Le Caine be allowed to oversee a small
    project in electronic music at NRC. After almost 15 years of working for the organization,
    Le Caine finally had a formal lab where he could blend his interests in electronics
    and music.

    he developed more than 20 different electronic musical instruments, including
    the [Sonde](https://soundandscience.net/artefacts/sonde/), the [Polyphone](https://soundandscience.net/artefacts/polyphone/),
    and the [Special Purpose Tape Recorder](https://soundandscience.net/artefacts/special-purpose-tape-recorder/).
    He crafted a number of components, such as voltage-controlled amplifiers, filters,
    and oscillators, that he reused in his instruments.
