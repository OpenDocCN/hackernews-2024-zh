- en: Researchers have used a novel technique to 3D print brain tissue whose cells
    developed into functional neurons that communicated with each other in a matter
    of weeks. They say the approach could be used to study healthy and unhealthy brains,
    test drugs, or simply observe how the brain develops.

    exploring disease pathology and testing new drugs. The brain presents particular
    challenges, including the fact that neurons grown in the lab have to form functional
    connections, and the brain tissue needs to support a complex but delicate architecture.

    brain tissue that grows and functions like a typical brain.

    and parts of the brain communicate in humans,” said Su-Chun Zhang, the study’s
    corresponding author. “It could change the way we look at stem cell biology, neuroscience
    and the pathogenesis of many neurological and psychiatric disorders.”

    cells (NPCs) mature and form connections (synapses) within and across layers while
    maintaining structure. They chose a fibrin hydrogel consisting primarily of fibrinogen
    and thrombin as the ‘bio-ink’, or biomaterial used for tissue printing, because
    it’s biocompatible with neural cells. Both fibrinogen and thrombin play a role
    in blood clotting.

    mixed it with a hyaluronic acid hydrogel, noting that a high number of NPCs placed
    into the mixture survived and matured. Adding another hydrogen made their bio-ink
    softer than those used previously.

- en: Rather than using the traditional 3D printing approach of vertically stacked
    layers, which requires a stiff bio-ink printed in thick layers, the researchers
    created patterned tissue by printing one thin layer or band of cell-infused gel
    next to another horizontally. To prevent the mixing of printed bands, thrombin
    was used as a crosslinking agent immediately after the mixture was deposited.

    formed functional synaptic connections in and between layers within two to five
    weeks after printing.

    to allow the neurons to grow into each other and start talking to each other,”
    Zhang said. “Our tissue stays relatively thin, and this makes it easy for the
    neurons to get enough oxygen and enough nutrients from the growth media.”

    striking,” said Zhang. “Even when we printed different cells belonging to different
    parts of the brain, they were still able to talk to each other in a very special
    and specific way.”

    of cells that [organoids](https://newatlas.com/medical/lab-grown-brain-organoids-mature-same-rate-infants/)
    and other printing methods don’t. And the printing technique doesn’t require special
    equipment or culturing methods to keep the tissue healthy, meaning that it should
    be accessible to many labs.

    of neurons at any time,” said Zhang. “Then we can piece them together at almost
    any time and in whatever way we like. Because we can print the tissue by design,
    we can have a defined system to look at how our human brain network operates.
    We can look very specifically at how the nerve cells talk to each other under
    certain conditions because we can print exactly what we want.”

    miss some critical components,” Zhang said. “Our brain operates in networks. We
    want to print brain tissue this way because cells do not operate by themselves.
    They talk to each other. This is how our brain works, and it has to be studied
    all together like this to truly understand it.”
