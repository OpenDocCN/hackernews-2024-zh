    modern mind.” Governmental authority was often divided between royal families
    and religious authority. Royals could be of a completely different nationality
    from the people they governed, with authority rooted in heredity and marriage
    rather than popular consent. (Britain’s ruling House of Windsor, currently led
    by King Charles III, [traces its origins](https://www.thoughtco.com/the-houses-of-windsor-and-hanover-4069109)
    to what is now Germany.) The authority of a king could be challenged by local
    barons and dukes. “No one thought it strange that a French soldier should command
    an army against the French and loyalty to a cause, to a religion, to a master,
    was commonly more highly esteemed than loyalty to a country,” Wedgwood wrote.

    corporations, often with senior executives from multiple countries and little
    loyalty to the country where they were based, could acquire a level of political
    power that rivaled national governments. “The hierarchies of international capitalism
