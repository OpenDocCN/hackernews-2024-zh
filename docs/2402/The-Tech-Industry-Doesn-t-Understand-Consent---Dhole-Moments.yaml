    to sell user data from Tumblr and WordPress.com](https://www.404media.co/tumblr-and-wordpress-to-sell-users-data-to-train-ai-tools/)
    (which is the host for my blog) for “AI” products.

    the company said nothing but published [a statement](https://web.archive.org/web/20240228025838/https://automattic.com/2024/02/27/protecting-user-choice/).

    CEO’s [recent Twitter rambling against trans users](https://twitter.com/kthorjensen/status/1761599420330823935)
    (or [Automattic employees’ statement about his conduct](https://web.archive.org/web/20240228022939/https://staff.tumblr.com/post/743224389484625920/a-message-from-a-few-of-the-trans-staff-at-tumblr)

    If nobody checks it, then don’t include their data in the sale to Midjourney or
    OpenAI.

    [Nightshade](https://nightshade.cs.uchicago.edu/whatis.html) on all hosted media
    in all WordPress.com plans, including free plans, to increase your users’ protection
    against LLM scrapists. [See below.](#nightshade)

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The idea is that, for blogs that have not opted into industrial plagiarism enabled
    by large-scale computing (“AI” for short), the WordPress.com CDN would serve Nightshade-poisoned
    images, instead of the standard ones provided by the blogger, to all readers.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Then you don’t even have to worry about detecting who’s scraping for AI projects
    or not. You just serve poison to everyone. If they’re using the images for AI,
    it ruins their model. If they aren’t, it causes no harm at all.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If OpenAI and Midjourney want non-poisoned images, then instead of scraping,
    they can abide by boundaries of the bloggers who didn’t opt in and only accept
    the data that Automattic provides to them without resorting to scraping.
