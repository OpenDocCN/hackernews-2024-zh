- en: It is with very mixed feelings that I am leaving Google (as in, *leaving right
    now* — today is my last day). Or perhaps I should say instead “leaving Android”
    since I have always felt very much part of the Android team and very much ignorant
    of the rest of the company.

    rough years of tech layoffs, my departure is self-inflicted: I quit. It is time
    for me to do something else — something very *very* else. It’s not so much that
    I’m leaving Google (Android), but that I’m leaving tech for, as Monty Python would
    say, something completely different.'

    Android team in May of 2010\. I wrote code, delivered presentations, videos and
    articles, and I managed people, all of which were thoroughly enjoyable teams,
    roles, and projects.

    school in 1992\. So after (checks calendar again, realizes it’s more of a calculator
    problem, gives up, does the math) *more than 31 years*, it’s time for something
    new. Or, rather, something old: school.'

    the Toolkit team for a few years, I moved to Developer Relations, where I managed
    a smaller team. I missed coding, so I rewound and came back, as an engineer on
    the graphics team. I then returned to the Toolkit team as an engineer, rewinding
    my career more. Now it’s time to rewind it all the way to where it began: I’m
    going back to grad school.'

    2-year program at DePaul, with comedy classes at Second City. Full time work plus
    school has been working out great, except for the part where I also need sleep.

- en: Leaving my job and career is by far the worst financial decision I ever hope
    to make. It turns out that tech has better pay, benefits, prospects, perks, and
    stability (yes, even in this rotten tech cycle we’re in). But comedy writing is
    something I *want* to do. I feel very strongly that everyone should try, to the
    extent that it makes some kind of sense if you squint hard enough, to do what
    they want in work and life. I’ve been writing and doing comedy— sometimes at the
    same time — for many years on the side. So I’m promoting my hobby to be my day
    job.

    again someday. Maybe coding will become my hobby. You can take the engineer out
    of the bytes, but you can’t take bites out of the engineer. Or something like
    that. But for now, it’s nice to just soak in the comedy, and the writing, and
    the student life. (My lunch often consists of PB&J and a pack of instant ramen.
    Sometimes both, when I feel really wild and spendy). As for what the future holds,
    I’ll figure that out when I get there. That’s the great thing about the future;
    it’s always there waiting for you. In the meantime, I have writing homework to
    do.

    I’ve had a [very] long career in software development and I’ve enjoyed all^H^H^H
    most of it immensely. But my time on, with, and for Android far surpassed everything
    else for the sheer excitement of being a part of the wild ride as Android became
    what it is today. When I joined Google, Android was in a solid 4th or 5th place
    behind, well, everyone else. By the end of that first year, the situation had
    changed drastically, and everything has only gotten bigger and better in the many
    years since.'

    needed (hello, [Animator](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/animation/package-summary)!),
    work on critical and interesting projects on the platform and AndroidX (hello,
    graphics, UI, and performance!), and work with a great team of clever, interesting,
    and passionate people for many years.

    I got to meet and be a part of a vibrant developer community for many years, including
    hosting a fun [podcast](http://adbackstage.libsyn.com) since 2014\. I hope to
    continue with the podcast from outside of Android. I always enjoyed my “color
    commentary” role, so maybe ignorance of what’s happening internally won’t be a
    drastic change.

    [the story of how Android came into existence](https://www.chethaase.com/androids)
    in the very early years. I had [written](https://chetchat.blogspot.com/) [many](https://graphics-geek.blogspot.com/)
    [things](http://medium.com/@chethaase) before that book, and had even written
    [several books](https://www.chethaase.com/books) before that book. But that 4+
    year project of interviewing and compiling first-hand tales of how it all came
    together is the highlight of my writing life (so far!).

    opportunities I enjoyed was giving tech and comedy talks at developer events.
    There is nothing like being on stage in front of a large audience and pretending
    to know what you’re talking about. I’m game for more of that if I can figure out
    logistics that make sense in my new student/writing life.* [*Let me know*](https://www.chethaase.com/contact)

    a mic) that might work.*'
