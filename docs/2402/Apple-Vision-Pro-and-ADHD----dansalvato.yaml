    Yosemite. I am a floating body manifested into the transcendental Tim Cook matrix.
    I look into the sky and follow the soft clouds as they pass overhead. They slowly
    part, revealing Steve Jobs' smiling face watching over me from the heavens above.
    I am merely one more thing.

- en: When I walked into the Apple Store yesterday, the first question I had for the
    assistant was the return policy on Apple Vision Pro. I have about 13 days left
    to decide if this thing is worth $3,500\. My early conclusion is that if you're
    an enthusiast for entertainment and you have a lot of money to spend on it, the
    Apple Vision Pro might be for you. Even the folks at the Apple Store seemed convinced
    that "entertainment" is the current selling point of this device.

    the hell to use it for.

    The display quality is stunning, but the video pass-through is starkly disappointing—granted,
    it's probably the best there is, but the world around me appears grainy and poorly-lit.
    On top of that, I'm definitely a bit clumsier with my hands.

    over them, indicating they're selected. This does not always happen in iPad apps.
    In Octal (a Hacker News reader), I have to guess whether I'm looking hard enough
    at the correct element to bring up the story or the comments. In Obsidian, pressing
    the corner buttons to expand the sidebar is nearly impossible.

    I move my head around. This tells me visionOS uses higher-quality anti-aliasing
    wherever your eyes are focused. Cool performance trick, but human peripheral vision
    is highly sensitive to motion, which makes the shimmering somewhat distracting.

- en: I'm sure I sound pretty underwhelmed by my experience. Perhaps, but the most
    exciting thing to me about Apple Vision Pro is that it has flaws like this. Flaws
    bring charm to gadgets. They make you use them more selectively and deliberately.
    Computers, phones and tablets have gotten boring because there is no longer such
    deliberate use—they are always there, able to do anything and instantly switch
    tasks as fast as your fingers can move.

    But as someone with ADHD, I feel acutely aware of my relationship to technology
    in this way. It is incredibly hard to focus on a single task and clear my mind
    of the "itch to screw around" when all the technology around me is so goddamn
    fast and easy to use.

- en: That's what makes Apple Vision Pro interesting for me. Navigating with your
    eyes and fingers is (currently) not as fast or easy as using a mouse or a touchscreen.
    Positioning windows in 3D space also takes time.

- en: This has an interesting effect. I feel less inclined to mindlessly open and
    use apps, because it has become a fundamentally mindful gesture to do so. I actually
    have to go out of my way to bring up the Home Screen, launch an app, position
    it where I want it, and interact with it by looking directly at it. I can't do
    these things on autopilot.

    distractions from the outside world. I'm not glancing around at the stuff in my
    office every time I pause to think.

    my face is making my interaction with the digital world more deliberate and mindful.

    build for Apple Vision Pro. If I make solid progress on it this week, I might
    keep the headset under justification for business.

- en: However, 14 days is unfortunately not enough time for me to decide whether Apple
    Vision Pro is a true quality-of-life improvement for an ADHD lifestyle. Maybe
    I'm still swept up in the novelty of it all. If I do end up keeping it, I'll definitely
    write a follow-up in the near future. But for this price tag, I can't justify
    the purchase on a "maybe".
