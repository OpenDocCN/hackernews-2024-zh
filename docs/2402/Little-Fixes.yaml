- en: I walked with a mother who was pushing a stroller in the ditch. She told me
    that she needed to go to the store, didn't have a car that day, and didn't feel
    safe walking along the street, so she was taking the ditch, knee-high weeds and
    all. I observed the well-worn path she was treading and realized this was a struggle
    being shared with others.

- en: I met an elderly woman going down the street using a walker, climbing over mounds
    of snow left by the snowplow. She told me she had no choice but to get to the
    pharmacy that day. She pointed out that the street was cleared of snow but the
    sidewalk wasn't, so she was walking where she had to.
