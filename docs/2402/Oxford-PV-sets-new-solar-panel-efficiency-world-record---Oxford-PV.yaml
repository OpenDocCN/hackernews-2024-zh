- en: With solar power accounting for three-quarters of renewable capacity additions
    worldwide in 2023¹, increasing the efficiency of solar panels has transformative
    potential in the drive towards net zero and an all-electric future. As the installation
    of solar power continues to gather pace, more efficient solar panels will generate
    more power over the same area, reducing the cost of electricity and further accelerating
    the adoption of clean energy.

- en: The Oxford PV silicon perovskite tandem solar panel delivered an output of 421
    watts on an area of 1.68 square meters, to become the world's most efficient perovskite
    silicon tandem solar module in industrial format. For the manufacturing process,
    the researchers used equipment at Fraunhofer ISE's Module-TEC that is already
    used in mass production and optimized the processes for the tandem technology.

    simulator](https://www.ise.fraunhofer.de/en/press-media/press-releases/2023/accurately-determine-efficiency-of-perovskite-silicon-tandem-pv-modules.html)
    to determine the module efficiency. In order to make precise and reproducible
    statements about the tandem module’s power, both the perovskite and the silicon
    cell layers were illuminated by different LED light sources under conditions that
    are as close as possible to those in which they produce electricity under natural
    sunlight.

- en: Oxford PV is a pioneer and technology leader in the field of perovskite solar
    cells. The company was established in 2010, as a spin-out from the University
    of Oxford. It focuses exclusively on developing and commercialising a perovskite-based
    solar technology. A research and development site in Oxford, UK, and an integrated
    production line near Berlin, Germany enable the accelerated transfer of its technology
    into industrial-scale perovskite-on-silicon tandem solar cell manufacturing.

- en: Oxford PV achieved a world-record efficiency of 28.6% for its commercial-sized
    perovskite-on-silicon tandem solar cell. The company has a clear roadmap to take
    this technology beyond 30% efficiency.

- en: Solar panels built with Oxford PV’s solar cell technology will generate more
    power than comparably sized, silicon-only based PV technology – critical for delivering
    more affordable clean energy, accelerating the adoption rate of solar, and addressing
    the climate crisis.
