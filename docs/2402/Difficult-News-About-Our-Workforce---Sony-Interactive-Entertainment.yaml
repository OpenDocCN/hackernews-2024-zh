- en: The PlayStation community means everything to us, so I felt it was important
    to update you on a difficult day at our company. We have made the extremely hard
    decision to announce our plan to commence a reduction of our overall headcount
    globally by about 8% or about 900 people, subject to local law and consultation
    processes. Employees across the globe, including our studios, are impacted.

    we are very grateful for their contributions. However, the industry has changed
    immensely, and we need to future ready ourselves to set the business up for what
    lies ahead. We need to deliver on expectations from developers and gamers and
    continue to propel future technology in gaming, so we took a step back to ensure
    we are set up to continue bringing the best gaming experiences to the community.

    to provide more context on our thinking. We deeply appreciate support and understanding
    from the PlayStation community as these decisions are very difficult. Please rest
    assured that our plans for reorganizing and streamlining are so we can continue
    to deliver the best gaming experiences possible.

    in this rapidly changing industry, we have concluded that tough decisions have
