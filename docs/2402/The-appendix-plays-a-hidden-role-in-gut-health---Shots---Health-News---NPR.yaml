    whether it served a function, prior to [Charles] Darwin's time. The [fact] that
    we can live without it does provide some support for the idea that it's vestigial
    and it doesn't really do anything. And so Darwin's interpretation of it as a vestige
    was reasonable at the time, given the information that he had.

- en: If you map the distribution of appendices across a phylogeny — a tree of mammal
    life — you can interpret that the appendix has actually [evolved independently](https://academic.oup.com/jeb/article/22/10/1984/7324393).
    It has appeared independently multiple times throughout mammalian evolution. So
    that is evidence that it must serve some adaptive function. It's unlikely that
    the same type of structure would keep appearing if it wasn't serving some beneficial
    role.

    function is supporting the immune system. The appendix has a high concentration
    of immune tissue, so it's acting to help the immune system fight any bad things
    in the gut.

    this was a hypothesis that was put forward by a team from [Duke University in
    2007](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17936308/). And they argued that the appendix
    may serve as a safe reservoir for the beneficial gut bacteria that we have.

    all of your good gut bacteria is getting kind of flushed out of the system — the
    appendix is kind of this blind tube with a very narrow diameter and narrow lumen,
    so the good bacteria doesn't get flushed out of the appendix. The idea is it's
    safe during this time of gastrointestinal distress and it can then exit the appendix
    and recolonize this good bacteria throughout the rest of the gut.

- en: Appendicitis is predominantly happening in the industrialized nations of the
    world — areas where fiber content of the diet tends to be lower. So one hypothesis
    is that, with the lower fiber content, we're more likely to get little pieces
    of food that's being digested stuck [inside] the appendix and cut off blood supply
    and cause this inflammation.
  id: totrans-split-32

- en: The other hypothesis that doesn't seem like it's quite as plausible these days
    has to do with an old idea called the hygiene hypothesis. The idea is that these
    days we do so much oversanitization, with all of our antibacterials and all our
    antibiotics that we take, that our immune systems are not developing properly
    because they don't have exposure to the full range of pathogens that we would
    otherwise. And so the immune system overreacts and panics. And because the appendix
    has so much immune tissue, it's one of the areas where this manifests.

    antibiotics and other ways of treating appendicitis without completely removing
    it, given the evidence that is accumulating that it is in fact helpful for your
    health to have an appendix. Studies have shown that infections with the really
    bad, nasty bacteria *C. diff* tend to be higher in people who have had their appendix
    removed.

    microanatomical adaptations that haven't been fully realized. So doing just descriptive
    studies of exotic animals that have never been described or looking at small parts
    of our own bodies that haven't been well documented are absolutely worthwhile.
