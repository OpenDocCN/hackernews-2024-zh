    we can live without it does provide some support for the idea that it's vestigial
    and it doesn't really do anything. And so Darwin's interpretation of it as a vestige
    was reasonable at the time, given the information that he had.

    life — you can interpret that the appendix has actually [evolved independently](https://academic.oup.com/jeb/article/22/10/1984/7324393).
    It has appeared independently multiple times throughout mammalian evolution. So
    that is evidence that it must serve some adaptive function. It's unlikely that
    the same type of structure would keep appearing if it wasn't serving some beneficial
    role.

- en: It turns out that the appendix appears to have two related functions. The first
    function is supporting the immune system. The appendix has a high concentration
    of immune tissue, so it's acting to help the immune system fight any bad things
    in the gut.
  id: totrans-split-27

  zh: 结果表明，阑尾似乎有两个相关的功能。第一个功能是支持免疫系统。阑尾有高浓度的免疫组织，因此它有助于免疫系统抵抗肠道中的有害物质。
- en: The second function that it serves is what we refer to as the safe house. So
    this was a hypothesis that was put forward by a team from [Duke University in
    2007](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17936308/). And they argued that the appendix
    may serve as a safe reservoir for the beneficial gut bacteria that we have.

  zh: 它提供的第二个功能是我们所说的“安全之所”。这是由[杜克大学在2007年提出的一个假设](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17936308/)。他们认为阑尾可能充当我们有益的肠道细菌的安全储存库。
- en: During times of gastrointestinal distress — you know, a diarrhea episode where
    all of your good gut bacteria is getting kind of flushed out of the system — the
    appendix is kind of this blind tube with a very narrow diameter and narrow lumen,
    so the good bacteria doesn't get flushed out of the appendix. The idea is it's
    safe during this time of gastrointestinal distress and it can then exit the appendix
    and recolonize this good bacteria throughout the rest of the gut.

  zh: 在胃肠不适期间 —— 你知道的，腹泻导致所有有益的肠道细菌被冲刷出体外的那种情况 —— 阑尾是一种很窄的盲管，内径很窄，腔道也很窄，因此有益的细菌不会被冲刷出阑尾。这个想法是在胃肠不适期间是安全的，并且这些有益的细菌可以离开阑尾重新在肠道其他部位定植。

    world — areas where fiber content of the diet tends to be lower. So one hypothesis
    is that, with the lower fiber content, we're more likely to get little pieces
    of food that's being digested stuck [inside] the appendix and cut off blood supply
    and cause this inflammation.

  zh: 阑尾炎主要发生在世界上的工业化国家——纤维素含量较低的地区。因此，有一个假设是，纤维素含量较低，我们更可能让一些消化的食物残渣卡在阑尾里面，阻断血液供应，导致这种炎症。
- en: The other hypothesis that doesn't seem like it's quite as plausible these days
    has to do with an old idea called the hygiene hypothesis. The idea is that these
    days we do so much oversanitization, with all of our antibacterials and all our
    antibiotics that we take, that our immune systems are not developing properly
    because they don't have exposure to the full range of pathogens that we would
    otherwise. And so the immune system overreacts and panics. And because the appendix
    has so much immune tissue, it's one of the areas where this manifests.

  zh: 另一个如今看起来不太可信的假设与一个旧概念——卫生假设有关。这个观点认为，现今我们过度消毒，使用各种抗菌剂和抗生素，以至于我们的免疫系统没有得到正常的发展，因为它们没有接触到我们本来应该接触到的各种病原体。因此，免疫系统会过度反应和惊慌。由于阑尾中含有大量的免疫组织，这就是其中一个体现的地方。
