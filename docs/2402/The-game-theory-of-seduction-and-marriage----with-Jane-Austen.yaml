    tremendous time, effort, and thought. We can feel that the stakes are very high.
    What is said, what is suggested, and what is possibly thought by the other person
    acquires high importance. Talented writers capture the tension of these moments,
    the careful way people navigate these situations potentially fraught with missteps,
    missed opportunities or overly candid overtures. The persistent fame of Jane Austen,
    who wrote about such situations in the early 19th century, is a reflection of
    her talent to understand the rich layers of these situations.

    The economist Thomas Piketty provided some background to the magnitude of the
    stakes they faced. The most striking change in fate is in *Pride and Prejudice*,
    Austen''s most famous novel: without marriage, Elizabeth would face social demotion.
    Being unable to inherit her father’s estate with her sisters, she would inherit
    from her mother 1,000 pounds, which would provide her with an income of around
    40 pounds per year, just around the average income of the day. In contrast, Mr.
    Darcy, who proposes to her, has an income of 10,000 pounds per year, representing
    300 times the average income of the day! For comparison, the average annual income
    is around $30,000 in the US. The modern equivalent of Darcy would be earning 9
    million dollars a year.'

    for nine months, have to make a large physiological investment to start with.

    to make in Jane Austen’s novels. Unlike in the modern dating process, they cannot
    get to know a potential partner intimately before deciding whether or not to commit
    to a relationship. They have to appraise the traits of potential pursuers carefully
    from the limited interactions and exchanges they have with them. Jane Austen’s
    stories recount women who use their wit and determination to navigate these high-stakes
    situations, avoid the dangerous matches and manage to attract the right ones.

    shows that men like 10 times more profiles than women do and that 1 in 50 of their
    likes leads to a match versus 2 out of 5 for women. Faced with many men happy
    to date them, women have to identify the ones who may be willing to invest in
    a long-term relationship. The costs of making wrong decisions are not negligible.
    Women looking for a long-term partner can lose precious years of their lives with
    men who are not truly interested in committing to a long-term relationship.

    where men must signal their genuine interest in a long-term relationship by investing
    time and resources in the dating process (Sozou and Seymour, 2005). This *courtship*
    behaviour makes it harder for men to pursue several women simultaneously. A man
    who chooses to court you, therefore reveals that you were high in his preferences.

    countries, asymmetric norms in the dating process nonetheless persist. In a survey

    should pay for the first date, 87% stated that he should bring flowers then, and
    66% stated that he should also pay for the second date (Cameron and Curry 2020).
    If these rules persist despite much greater equality between men and women, it
    is because they are the solution to the asymmetry in eagerness for short-term
    relationships between men and women.

    to put oneself in another's shoes as *theory of mind*. Getting an idea about the

    minds what beliefs would reasonably be formed from another person's perspective.
    Understanding other people’s beliefs about our beliefs—a third-order belief—requires
    simulating the perspective of somebody simulating our perspective. Climbing higher-order

    capacity explore the possibility of a romantic interest. In such situations, guarded
    overtures are cautiously made, trying to maintain a balance between suggesting
    a possible interest and retaining plausible deniability. Overtures are needed
    to gauge whether the interest could be reciprocal. Keeping an overture somewhat
    ambiguous allows for the pretence that nothing was intended beyond the facade
    of the interaction if it is not met positively. If an overture is met positively,
    another can be made.

    shared understanding that the civil facade of the interaction may conceal a romantic
    interest on both parts. This process continues until the point where the remaining
    uncertainty is light enough for the facade to be lifted and one of the individuals
    to make an explicit overture. In the time of Jane Austen, this was suitably resolved
    by an engagement whereby the man proposes.

    romantic interest. However, there is a risk of women being too aloof and ending

    Signalling too little interest might result in missed opportunities, but excessive
    eagerness could prematurely resolve uncertainty in situations where expectations
    about the prospect of a relationship are actually not aligned. When one’s feelings
    are not definitely set, suggesting eagerness might unduly heighten the other person’s
    expectations, necessitating a tedious toning down of these expectations later
    on. Conversely, if the other person happens not to be that inclined, revealing
    too much eagerness may lead to a painful explicit rejection. Both situations would
    lead to *awkwardness* because once uncertainty has been lifted and explicit statements
    have been made, they cannot be put back in the bottle.

    principles. Jane Austen was a master at understanding the strategic layers of
    romantic situations and the psychology of protagonists involved in these interactions.
    It is because of the persistent commonality between the situations she describes
    and those we face today that Jane Austen still captivates modern audiences. Game
