- en: Nvidia is by far the most prominent producer of the semiconductor chip technology
    powering generative AI. Investors have been impressed not just by the potential
    for Nvidia to capitalize on the growing interest and corporate spending in AI,
    but also by its already exploding results. Nvidia’s earnings before interest,
    taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) expanded by more than 500% last
    quarter on a year-over-year basis thanks to runaway growth in its AI unit, far
    stronger than Amazon and Alphabet’s robust 20% or more earnings growth during
    the comparable period. Nvidia’s gross revenue and profits are less eye-popping
    than its trillion-dollar company peers – its $9.2 billion profit last quarter
    was far smaller than Apple’s and Microsoft’s over $22 billion profits during the
    comparable stretch – but analysts expect Nvidia’s financials to soon close the
    gap. Nvidia remains among the most popular stocks on Wall Street even after its
    more than 50% run-up this year, and is a top pick for analysts at both Goldman
    Sachs and Bank of America, each of which has an $800 price target for Nvidia,
    implying 8% further upside for the stock.

- en: Nvidia stock’s 17,000% gain over the last decade is by far the best return of
    any stock on the S&P 500, nearly tripling the return of silver medalist and fellow
    chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices. A $1,000 investment in Nvidia a decade ago would
    now be worth about $175,000.
