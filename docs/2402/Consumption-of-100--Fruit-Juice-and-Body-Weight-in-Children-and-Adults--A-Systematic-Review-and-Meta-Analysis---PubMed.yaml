    fruit juices were compared with noncaloric controls.'

    including 17 among children (17 cohorts; 0 RCTs; 45 851 children; median [IQR]
    age, 8 [1-15] years) and 25 among adults (6 cohorts; 19 RCTs; 268 095 adults;
    median [IQR] age among cohort studies, 48 [41-61] years; median [IQR] age among
    RCTs, 42 [25-59]). Among cohort studies in children, each additional serving per
    day of 100% fruit juice was associated with a 0.03 (95% CI, 0.01-0.05) higher
    BMI change. Among cohort studies in adults, studies that did not adjust for energy
    showed greater body weight gain (0.21 kg; 95% CI, 0.15-0.27 kg) than studies that
    did adjust for energy intake (-0.08 kg; 95% CI, -0.11 to -0.05 kg; P for meta-regression
    <.001). RCTs in adults found no significant association of assignment to 100%
    fruit juice with body weight but the CI was wide (MD, -0.53 kg; 95% CI, -1.55
    to 0.48 kg).'

    cohort studies, in this systematic review and meta-analysis, 1 serving per day
    of 100% fruit juice was associated with BMI gain among children. Findings in adults
    found a significant association among studies unadjusted for total energy, suggesting
    potential mediation by calories. Further trials of 100% fruit juice and body weight
    are desirable. Our findings support guidance to limit consumption of fruit juice
    to prevent intake of excess calories and weight gain.'
