    Sen. Ron Wyden (OR) details new information on data broker Near, which sold the
    location data of people seeking reproductive healthcare to anti-abortion groups.
    Near enabled these groups to send targeted ads promoting anti-abortion content
    to people who had visited Planned Parenthood and similar clinics.'

    that Near was selling location data to anti-abortion groups. Specifically, the
    *Journal* found that the Veritas Society, a non-profit established by Wisconsin
    Right to Life, had hired ad agency Recrue Media. That agency purchased location
    data from Near and used it to target anti-abortion messaging at people who had
    sought reproductive healthcare.

    taken down but [saved by the Internet Archive](https://web.archive.org/web/20211203103204/https:/veritassociety.com/digital-technology/))
    and stated that it delivered over 14 million ads to people who visited reproductive
    healthcare clinics. These ads appeared on Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, and other
    social media for people who had sought reproductive healthcare.

    the agency used Near’s website to literally “draw a line” around areas their client
    wanted them to target. They drew these lines around reproductive health care facilities
    across the country, using location data purchased from Near to target visitors
    to 600 Planned Parenthood different locations. Sen. Wyden’s team also confirmed
    with Near that, until the summer of 2022, no safeguards were in place to protect
    the data privacy of people visiting sensitive places.

    government, though it claimed on its website to be doing no such thing. As of
    October 18, 2023, Sen. Wyden’s investigation found Near was still selling location
    data harvested from Americans without their informed consent.

    [privacy-first legislation](https://www.eff.org/wp/privacy-first-better-way-address-online-harms)
    that limits how corporations collect and monetize our data. We also need privacy
    statutes that prevent the government from sidestepping the Fourth Amendment by
    purchasing location information—as Sen. Wyden has [proposed](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/04/tell-congress-support-fourth-amendment-not-sale-act).
    Even the government [admits this is a problem](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2023/07/even-government-thinks-it-should-stop-buying-corporate-surveillance-data).
     Furthermore, as Near’s misconduct illustrates, safeguards must be in place that
    protect people in sensitive locations from being tracked.

    we’ve seen data brokers sell information that can reveal visits to abortion clinics.
    We need laws now to strengthen privacy protections for consumers. We thank Sen.
    Wyden for conducting this investigation. We also commend [the FTC’s recent bar
    on a data broker selling sensitive location data](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2024/01/ftc-bars-x-mode-selling-sensitive-location-data).
    We hope this represents the start of a longstanding trend.'
