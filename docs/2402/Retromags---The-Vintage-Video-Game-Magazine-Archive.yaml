- en: This site is set up to digitally preserve video game magazines from 10 years
    ago and earlier. The rules vary on a case-by-case basis. We do this because issues
    of these magazines are not readily available from publishers/content owners. While
    we don’t have legal permission, we operate in a way where we do not release anything
    that will reduce any potential income for you, or magazines that are available
    from you, nor do we release scans that are of a quality that may reflect poorly
    on you. So far this has worked, with several publishers/content owners basically
    ignoring our existence. However, if you wish that we do not make content that
    you legally have ownership of available on this site, **[just let us know](https://www.retromags.com/contact/)**
    and we will remove it. While we would prefer permission, we will fully oblige
    with your wishes concerning your content. This is a hobby we do out of passion
    and love for the video game magazines of yesterday, and not worth legal battles
    of any kind.
