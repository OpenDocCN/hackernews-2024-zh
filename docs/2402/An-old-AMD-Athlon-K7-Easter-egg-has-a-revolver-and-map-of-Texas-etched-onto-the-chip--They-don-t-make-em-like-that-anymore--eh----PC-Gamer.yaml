- en: When [AMD's Athlon K7 CPU](https://www.pcgamer.com/a-brief-history-of-cpus-31-awesome-years-of-x86/4/)
    was launched way back in 1999, it turned out to be something of an Intel-killer,
    smashing the heavyweight's Pentium III CPU. Now it turns out those K7 chips were
    actual gun slingers, at least insofar as they had bullet-blasting guns etched
    right into their silicon dies.

    a sideline in gorgeous photography of CPU and GPU dies. If you zoom into one corner
    of the top metal layer you can apparently see a revolver firing a bullet, right
    next to a map of Texas.

    gun and speeding bullet? Well, that's anyone's guess.

    with Intel for performance. Not only did it launch with the same 600MHz peak clockspeeds
    as the Pentium III of the day, it actually offered superior performance in some
    benchmarks. And that's including the applications that majored on floating point
    performance, which were previously the preserve of Intel's finest CPUs.

    widely regarded as one of the leading chip architects of recent decades and [the
    man behind AMD's current series of Zen CPU architectures](https://www.pcgamer.com/amds-zen-5-cpu-is-scary-fast-according-to-performance-numbers-from-the-actual-father-of-zen/),
    had a hand in K7's design. Anyway, long story short, K7 proved to be faster than
    Pentium III in Quake III, and that's really all that matters, right?

    review](https://www.anandtech.com/show/355/17) with the Athlon K7 clocking up
    just under 120fps while the Pentium III lumbers along below 100fps. Ouch!

    it was built on a 0.25 micron process, which essentially means 250nm, and contained
    22 million transistors.

    that K7 wasn't just there to snag some low-end budget PC sales but was intended
    to make AMD a real contender for premium performance for the first time.

    25 billion transistors. AMD also overtook Intel when it comes to market cap, or
    the overall value of a company according to its share price, in June 2022.

- en: Today, AMD is worth about $270 billion to Intel's $180 billion, an eventuality
    that would have been very, very hard to believe back in 1999, especially when
    you consider that Intel had a similar market cap in 1999 to that which is has
    today but AMD was only worth a couple of billion.
