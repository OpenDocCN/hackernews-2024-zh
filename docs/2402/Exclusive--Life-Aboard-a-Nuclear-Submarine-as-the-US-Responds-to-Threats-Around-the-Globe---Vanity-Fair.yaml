- en: There, I was invited into the buzzing corridors of the US Strategic Command
    (STRATCOM), the nerve center of America’s nuclear arsenal, located at Offutt Air
    Force Base. This is the place that produced the *Enola Gay* and *Bockscar,* the
    B-29s that dropped atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki; the place where President
    George W. Bush had taken temporary refuge on 9/11.

  zh: 我被邀请进入美国战略司令部（STRATCOM）的喧嚣走廊，这是美国核武库的神经中枢，位于奥法特空军基地。这里生产了*艾诺拉·盖伊*和*博克斯卡尔*，投下广岛和长崎原子弹的B-29轰炸机；这是乔治·W·布什总统在9/11事件中暂时躲藏的地方。
- en: 'When I arrived, I spotted mechanics attending to two aircraft on the tarmac.
    One was an E-6B Mercury, a nondescript plane that, if needed, can serve as both
    a communications relay for ballistic-missile subs like the *Wyoming* and as an
    airborne launch control for land-based ICBMs. Nearby was a heavily militarized
    version of a Boeing 747, the E-4B Nightwatch, which houses the National Airborne
    Operations Center, which, according to its mission statement, “provides a highly
    survivable command, control and communications center…in case of national emergency
    or destruction of ground command and control centers.” Its nickname: the Doomsday
    Plane.'

  zh: 当我到达时，我看到机械师们正在机坪上维修两架飞机。其中一架是E-6B水星飞机，一架不起眼的飞机，如果需要，可以作为弹道导弹潜艇（如*怀俄明*）的通讯中继，并作为陆基洲际导弹的空中发射控制。附近是波音747的重型军事版本，E-4B守夜飞机，内部设有国家空中作战指挥中心，根据其任务声明，“在国家紧急情况或地面指挥控制中心被摧毁时提供高度可生存的指挥、控制和通信中心。”它的绰号是末日飞机。
- en: STRATCOM—with its 150,000 service members and civilians—is led by an Air Force
    four-star, General Anthony Cotton, who ushered me through his sprawling outer
    office, swarming with airmen, sailors, soldiers, and Marines, before taking me
    into his inner sanctum, a hushed, wood-paneled oasis in the eye of the storm.
    Cotton, along with Secretary of [Defense Lloyd Austin III](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/13/us/politics/lloyd-austin-private-public.html)
    and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs General [Charles Brown Jr.](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/29/us/politics/general-cq-brown-joint-chiefs.html),
    is part of a trio of Black leadership atop America’s national-security pyramid.
    And it was a point of pride, clearly, that of all the Black four-stars, as Cotton
    told me, “there’s only been 10 in the history of the Air Force, and I’m number
    10.”

  zh: STRATCOM有15万名服务成员和文职人员，由空军四星将军安东尼·科顿（General Anthony Cotton）领导。他带我穿过繁忙的外围办公室，里面挤满了空军人员、海军人员、陆军士兵和海军陆战队员，然后带我进入他的内部圣所，一个静谧的木饰板绿洲，在风暴眼中。科顿将军与国防部长劳埃德·奥斯汀三世（[Lloyd
    Austin III](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/13/us/politics/lloyd-austin-private-public.html)）和联合参谋首席查尔斯·布朗将军（[Charles
    Brown Jr.](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/29/us/politics/general-cq-brown-joint-chiefs.html)）共同组成了美国国家安全金字塔的黑人领导三人组。科顿显然为此感到自豪，他告诉我说：“在所有黑人四星将军中，历史上只有10位，而我是第10位。”
- en: I asked what drew him to the service. “Simple,” he said, walking over to a display
    case containing a folded flag with a picture next to it. “That’s my dad. He joined
    in 1942\. As you can see, he was a diamond-wearing African American that was in
    World War II in the Army Air Corps, made the transition to the Air Force, and
    retired as a chief master sergeant in 1974\. So I came out of the womb as a member
    of the military.” He was emotional as he recalled how, in 2000, his father passed
    away a month to the day after his mother. “He didn’t see me make lieutenant colonel,
    but I buried with him my promotion recommendation form.”

  zh: 我问他是什么吸引了他加入这项服务。他说：“很简单”，然后走到一个展示柜前，里面有一面折叠的国旗，旁边放着一张照片。“那是我爸爸。他在1942年加入了。正如你所见，他是一位戴钻石的非裔美国人，曾在二战期间加入了陆军航空兵团，后来转入空军，并于1974年退休时担任首席军士长。所以我一出生就是军人的后代。”
    他情绪激动地回忆起，2000年，他的父亲在母亲去世后的一个月去世。“他没能看到我晋升为中校，但我把晋升推荐表和他一起埋了。”
- en: I found Cotton, from Goldsboro, North Carolina, to be open, gregarious, and
    quick to laugh—traits that might seem at odds with the solemnity of his mission.
    “I don’t want to walk the halls of the Pentagon and when people see me, they’re
    like, ‘Oh, there’s General Cotton, the nuclear guy,’ ” he said.

- en: Cotton, 60, recounted how he’d first felt the weight of command as a 22-year-old
    on his inaugural ride out to a missile field in Minot, North Dakota. “You’re jumping
    in that Suburban,” he said, “knowing that you’re responsible to execute, under
    presidential authorities, the most powerful weapon on the face of the globe. You
    see the humming of the launch control center and you see 10 green lights and know
    that on the other side of that green light is a Minuteman III, with warheads on
    board. It all becomes *real* at that point.” Cotton would eventually hold a string
    of lofty leadership posts, most recently running the Air Force Global Strike Command,
    responsible for the country’s bombers and ICBMs.

- en: 'His job as STRATCOM chief: preparing and, if necessary, turning to the tools
    at his disposal, from conventional long-range strike weapons and multiplatform
    nuclear arms to joint electromagnetic spectrum operations, which involve exploiting
    and attacking enemy frequencies (as well as protecting our own). Being able to
    provide those options to the commander in chief “is what I do,” he explained,
    before taking stock of the geopolitical moment. “That’s important, especially
    now as we see the threat vectors to rules-based international order.” Translation:
    Over the second half of the last century, Western national security officials
    were preoccupied with trying to keep one adversary (the USSR) in check, even as
    the dueling nuclear powers ratified landmark arms control treaties. With those
    efforts now in eclipse and nuclear proliferation a chilling reality, America and
    its allies are currently contending with two near-peer opponents, Russia and China,
    as well as their own set of allies with nuclear aspirations, including North Korea,
    Iran, and, by extension, the Axis of Resistance—a term that encompasses armed
    groups like the Houthis in Yemen, Hamas in Gaza, Hezbollah in Lebanon and Syria,
    and the Popular Mobilization Forces in Iraq.'
