    of angry mail from strangers. What upset them was not the novel a comedy about
    a family in crisis but some impolitic remarks I'd made in the press, and I knew
    that it was a mistake to send more than bland one-sentence notes in reply. But
    I couldn't help fighting back a little. Taking a page from an old literary hero
    of mine, William Gaddis, who had long deplored the reading public's confusion
    of the writer's work and the writer's private self, I suggested that the letter
    writers look at my fiction rather than listen to distorted news reports about
    its author.

    that I subscribe to two wildly different models of how fiction relates to its
    audience. In one model, which was championed by Flaubert, the best novels are
    great works of art, the people who manage to write them deserve extraordinary
    credit, and if the average reader rejects the work it's because the average reader
    is a philistine; the value of any novel, even a mediocre one, exists independent
    of how many people are able to appreciate it. We can call this the Status model.
    It invites a discourse of genius and art-historical importance.

- en: In the opposing model, a novel represents a compact between the writer and the
    reader, with the writer providing words out of which the reader creates a pleasurable
    experience. Writing thus entails a balancing of self-expression and communication
    within a group, whether the group consists of "Finnegans Wake" enthusiasts or
    fans of Barbara Cartland. Every writer is first a member of a community of readers,
    and the deepest purpose of reading and writing fiction is to sustain a sense of
    connectedness, to resist existential loneliness; and so a novel deserves a reader's
    attention only as long as the author sustains the reader's trust. This is the
    Contract model. The discourse here is one of pleasure and connection. My mother
    would have liked it.

  zh: 在对立的模式中，一部小说代表了作者和读者之间的契约，作者提供了文字，读者从中创造了一种愉快的体验。因此，写作涉及自我表达和在一个群体内的沟通的平衡，无论这个群体是“芬尼根的苏醒”狂热者还是芭芭拉·卡特兰的粉丝。每一个作家首先是读者群体的成员，读和写虚构小说的最深层目的是维持一种联系感，抵抗存在的孤独感；因此，一本小说只有在作者保持读者的信任时才值得读者关注。这就是契约模型。这里的话语是关于愉悦和联系的。我母亲会喜欢的。
- en: 'To an adherent of Contract, the Status crowd looks like an arrogant connoisseurial
    elite. To a true believer in Status, on the other hand, Contract is a recipe for
    pandering, aesthetic compromise, and a babel of competing literary subcommunities.
    With certain novels, of course, the distinction doesn''t matter so much. "Pride
    and Prejudice," "The House of Mirth": you call them art, I call them entertainment,
    we both turn the pages. But the two models diverge tellingly when readers find
    a book difficult.'

- en: According to the Contract model, difficulty is a sign of trouble. In the most
    grievous cases, it may convict an author of placing his selfish artistic imperatives
    or his personal vanity ahead of the audience's legitimate desire to be entertained
    of being, in other words, an asshole. Taken to its free-market extreme, Contract
    stipulates that if a product is disagreeable to you the fault must be the product's.
    If you crack a tooth on a hard word in a novel, you sue the author. If your professor
    puts Dreiser on your reading list, you write a harsh student evaluation. If the
    local symphony plays too much twentieth-century music, you cancel your subscription.

    that the novel's author has disdained cheap compromise and stayed true to an artistic
    vision. Easy fiction has little value, the argument goes. Pleasure that demands

    of his generation, he frankly endorsed Status and disdained Contract. His methods
    were increasingly postmodern, but he had old-fashioned Romantic and high-modern
    notions of the artist as savior and the work of art as singular and sacred; the
    plight of both art and artist in a commercially mad America was at the center
    of his work. Which work is, itself, quintessentially difficult.

    During the previous year, while my father, in a different time zone, was losing
    his mind, I'd written two treatments and four full drafts of an "original" screenplay.
    In lieu of actual dollar payments, I had the enthusiastic support of a Hollywood
    agent who, out of pity or negligence, never mentioned that my story bore a fatal
    resemblance to "Fun with Dick and Jane," which I hadn't seen. My story had double
    and triple crosses and characters who used prosthetic makeup to impersonate other
    characters. I lived in that state of rage which comes of doing sustained work
    that you know to be shoddy and dishonest. By September, when I finally abandoned
    the project, one wall of my study was scuffed and dented from the pencils, scripts,
    shoes, and phone books I'd been throwing at it. I borrowed money and left Philadelphia
    to sublet a dark, underfurnished Tribeca loft (yes, Mrs. M, a loft), whose silence
    was disturbed only by the shadowy traffic of pigeons in the air shaft. I'd been
    hoping to write some fiction, but I was far too sick of audience-friendly narrative,
    of well-made plots and lovable characters. One evening, in a state of grim distraction,
    like somebody going out to score hard drugs, I walked up Sixth Avenue and bought
    "The Recognitions" in a beautiful, newly reissued Penguin edition.

    oxygen was at a premium, and the emotional temperature of the novel started cold

    person"), but otherwise the author's satiric judgments and intellectual obsessions
    discouraged intimacy. It was a struggle to figure out what, or even who, the story
    was about; dialogue was punctuated with dashes and largely unattributed; Wyatt
    himself dwindled to a furtive, seldom-glimpsed pronoun ("he"); there came brutish
    party scenes, all-dialogue word storms that raged for scores of pages. The only

- en: 'But I loved it. At the novel''s hidden pinnacle, behind its clouds of subsidiary
    symbolism, beyond its blind canyons of Beat anti-narrative, is a story about the
    loss of personal integrity and the difficult work of regaining it. Wyatt, a talented
    painter and former seminarian in his early thirties, is living in New York, unhappily
    married, and scraping by as a hired draftsman. He has abandoned his painterly
    ambitions, possibly because a corrupt French critic panned his early work, but
    more likely because he is incredibly earnest and has never found an adequate reply
    to the condemnation of art which a puritanical great-aunt issued in his boyhood:
    "Our Lord is the only true creator, and only sinful people try to emulate Him."
    One day, in New York, an American capitalist and art collector named Recktall
    Brown proposes a Faustian bargain: Wyatt will forge the work of Flemish Old Masters,
    and Brown will sell them for huge sums. Wyatt agrees to the deal, but after some
    early success he proves lacking in the necessary spinelessness. He considers resuming
    his religious studies, but when he goes home to New England he discovers that
    his father, a Protestant minister, has taken up Mithraism and lost his mind. Wyatt
    thereupon embarks on a long pilgrimage of sorts, first in New York, where he tries
    to expose his own forgeries, and later in Europe. He is last seen leaving a Spanish
    monastery, on page 900, intending, "at last, to live deliberately." Having surmounted
    the American Protestant suspicion of art and survived the dangerous attractions
    of the American Protestant marketplace, he seems finally on his way to being a

    sixth-grade teacher takes the class to Wall Street to buy one share of Diamond
    Cable stock and "learn how our system works." While the class's new stock is losing
    ten per cent of its value in a few hours, and brokers and corporate officers are
    engaging in vile manipulations of markets and senators and foreign governments,
    and a corporate P.R. flak is laying on the smarm ("you and your other fellow Americans
    no longer play a passive part in our nation's great economy"), J R is studying
    the bylaws of Diamond Cable, asking dead-on questions like "What's a warrant?"
    and "What's that minus sign two and an eighth?" and ascertaining that the class's
    share of stock entitles it to file a shareholder's lawsuit. Within weeks, by threatening
    such a suit and accepting a cash settlement, J R, who conducts his business on
    a pay phone at the middle school, acquires his working capital. He buys a million
    and a half Navy-surplus wooden picnic forks, a bankrupt textile mill in upstate
    New York, and then an outward-spiralling galaxy of dubious concerns a brewery,
    a printer, a publisher, a nursing home, a mortuary. Like his creator, J R is an
    obsessive. (Also like Gaddis, J R has no visible father. His mother is a busy
    nurse.) He pursues what his country teaches him is worth pursuing. He's devoid
    of charm, compassion, and scruples, but he doesn't know any better, and so you
    root for him against the novel's many corporate and legal sharks, who should know
    better but behave just as badly. "J R" anticipates Jonathan Lebed, the alleged
    teen-age market manipulator in New Jersey. It predicts the S. & L. crises and
    corporate raiders of the eighties ("Because like what good is this here pension
    fund doing just sitting there," J R wonders, "if we can like put it to work for
    them to get this here acquisition, you know?"), and it nicely demolishes President
    Bush's claim that Wall Street greed was an anomaly of the nineties.

    and the postmoderns resorted to a kind of literature of emergency. The moderns
    employed new, self-conscious methods to address the new reality and preserve the
    vanishing old one. The postmodern enterprise was even more radical: to resist
    absorption or cooptation by an all-absorbing, all-coopting System. Closure was
    the enemy, and the way to avoid it was to refuse to participate in the System.
    For Pynchon this meant flight and paranoia; for Burroughs it meant transgression.

    from each member of its audience. You can walk past a painting fifty times before

    its structures dawn on you, but a difficult novel just sits there on your shelf

  zh: 如果《J R》致力于证明美国很糟糕，他的第三部小说《木匠的哥特式》（1985年）的信息是，它真的，真的，真的很糟糕。加迪斯自己承认这本书是“一种风格的锻炼”，它的内容严格按部就班。一个上镜的南方传教士原来是一个危险的、贪婪的伪君子！一个美国参议员原来是腐败的！这本书是一种空壳。与《承认》不同，它得到了漂亮的评论。
- en: Gaddis's last real novel, "A Frolic of His Own," rambles on for nearly six hundred
    pages in illustration of how a system designed to create order (American law)
    can end up sponsoring disorder. The book is ideal for graduate study. It makes
    a banal but unexceptionable social point (we litigate too much in America), it's
    riddled with motifs, quotations, stories within stories, and countless allusions
    to Gaddis's own earlier works and other famous texts (better brush up on your
    Plato and Longfellow), and its only aesthetic weakness, really, is that much of
    it is repetitive, incoherent, and insanely boring. This novel, of course, got
    the warmest reviews of any of Gaddis's books, and was given one of those unofficial
    lifetime-achievement National Book Awards.

  zh: 加迪斯的最后一部真正的小说《他自己的嬉戏》，差不多六百页，说明了一个旨在创造秩序的系统（美国法律）如何最终赞助了混乱。这本书非常适合研究生学习。它提出了一个平庸但不容置疑的社会观点（在美国我们诉讼太多了），它充满了主题、引文、故事中的故事以及对加迪斯自己早期作品和其他著名文本的无数引用（最好熟悉你的柏拉图和朗费罗），它唯一的审美弱点，实际上，是它的很多地方是重复的、不连贯的、令人疯狂的无聊。当然，这部小说得到了加迪斯的所有书中最热情的评价，并且被授予了一项非官方的终身成就国家图书奖。
- en: 'The best parts of "Frolic" are the legal opinions and the characterizations.
    Creating a character entirely through dialogue is like boxing with one arm behind
    your back, and I''m not persuaded by the Gaddistic argument that straining our
    imaginations makes a character any more real to us. (In fact, the work of reading
    Gaddis makes me wonder if our brains might even be hard-wired for conventional
    storytelling, structurally eager to form pictures from sentences as featureless
    as "She stood up.") Still, his inferentially drawn characters can be vivid. Oscar
    Crease is a fifty-something amateur playwright and part-time professor in whose
    disorderly person a comically large number of lawsuits intersect. He lives in
    the large old house of his childhood on Long Island, hopelessly surrounded by
    a lifetime''s worth of miscellaneous papers: another cartoon of entropy. Functionally,
    Oscar is a baby. He spends much of the novel in a wheelchair, forever pawing at
    his girlfriend''s blouse, trying to get his hands and mouth on her breasts, and
    sucking down wine day and night.'

  zh: '"Frolic"中最精彩的部分是法律意见和人物刻画。仅通过对话来创造角色就像是单臂拳击，我对加迪斯式的论点并不认同，即我们的想象力的努力使角色对我们更真实。
    （事实上，阅读加迪斯的作品让我想知道我们的大脑是否甚至被硬性连线到传统叙事，结构上急切地从句子中形成如“她站起来”这样的无特色图片。）然而，他所推断出的角色可以栩栩如生。奥斯卡·克里斯是一个五十多岁的业余剧作家和兼职教授，他混乱的个人生活中滑稽地交汇了大量诉讼。他住在长岛的童年大房子里，无望地被一生的各种杂志围绕着：另一种混乱的卡通。从功能上讲，奥斯卡是一个婴儿。他在小说中的大部分时间都在轮椅上，永远试图抓住女友的衬衫，试图把手和嘴伸进她的胸部，并整天喝酒。'
- en: 'In "The Recognitions," a son grows up and vanishes. "Carpenter''s Gothic,"
    the book without children, is a book without hope. At the center of the other
    two novels is a very large child. In "Frolic," it''s the selfish, unreasonable,
    self-pitying, incapable, insatiable Oscar, a pig in the role of king, a suffering
    artist who (ha ha!) happens to have little talent. Oscar claims your sympathy
    only to abuse it. His long play about the Civil War is obviously and unfunnily
    bad, but a hundred pages are devoted to reproducing the manuscript and another
    fifty to endless jawing about its relation to art, justice, and order. The novel
    is an example of the particular corrosiveness of literary postmodernism. Gaddis
    began his career with a Modernist epic about the forgery of masterpieces. He ended
    it with a pomo romp that superficially resembles a masterpiece but punishes the
    reader who tries to stay with it and follow its logic. When the reader finally
    says, Hey, wait a minute, this is a mess, not a masterpiece, the book instantly
    morphs into a performance-art prop: its fraudulence is the whole point! And the
    reader is out twenty hours of good-faith effort.'

  zh: 在《承认》中，一个儿子长大并消失了。《木匠的哥特式》是一个没有孩子的书，也是一个没有希望的书。另外两部小说的中心是一个非常大的孩子。在《Frolic》中，这是自私、不合理、自怜、无能、贪婪的奥斯卡，一个猪扮演国王的角色，一个受苦的艺术家（哈哈！）恰巧缺乏天赋。奥斯卡只是为了滥用你的同情心。他关于内战的长篇剧本显然是不好笑的，但有一百页是用来复制手稿的，另外五十页则是无尽地讨论它与艺术、正义和秩序的关系。这部小说是文学后现代主义的一种特殊侵蚀。加迪斯以一部关于名画伪造的现代史诗开始了他的职业生涯。他以一部浅薄地类似于杰作的波摇小说结束了它，但对于试图留在其中并按其逻辑行事的读者来说，会受到惩罚。当读者最终说，嘿，等等，这是一团糟，不是一部杰作时，这本书立即变成了一种表演艺术道具：它的欺诈性就是全部意义！读者则失去了二十个小时的诚信努力。
- en: 'Regarding Gaddis''s two posthumously published books, I feel the way I did
    when my father was in a nursing home. Unless you''re a very good old friend, it''s
    better not to see him suffering like this. The title of Gaddis''s last novel,
    "Agape Agape," comes from a tonally arch and intellectually dubious essay that
    he once wrote about player pianos and mechanization in the arts. The book is mainly
    a free-form rant, however, *with the sentences, yes, run the sentences, run together,
    make it choppy, even easier than it looks but no what no, what matters is the
    art*. An unnamed novelist lies dying, his body a wreck that has betrayed his spirit.
    He reproaches himself for his failures, denounces the populist "herd" for misunderstanding
    him, and worries that he''s perceived as a mere "cartoon." But a cartoon is what
    "Agape Agape" is: one opaque, obsessive, citation-riddled, solipsistic paragraph
    deifying "the work" as "the only refuge" from one''s painful humanity. The novel
    did manage to stab me with its final note, a note reminiscent of Gaddis''s early
    dreams of a Nobel Prize'

  zh: 关于加迪斯两本死后出版的书，我感受到了我父亲在养老院时的感觉。除非你是一个非常好的老朋友，否则最好不要看到他这样受苦。加迪斯最后一部小说的标题《爱的爱》来自于他曾经写过的一个语气强烈、智力可疑的关于自动钢琴和艺术机械化的文章。然而，这本书主要是一场自由形式的咆哮，*是的，句子，让句子跑，句子连在一起，让它变得零碎，甚至比它看起来更容易，但不，重要的是艺术*。一个无名的小说家正在垂死，他的身体是一个背叛了他的灵魂的废墟。他责备自己的失败，谴责普通大众“群体”误解他，并担心自己被看作只是一个“卡通”。但《爱的爱》就是一个卡通：一个不透明的、痴迷的、充斥引用的、自我中心的段落，把“工作”神化为“唯一的避难所”，使人逃避痛苦的人性。这部小说确实用其最后的音符刺伤了我，这个音符让人想起加迪斯早期对诺贝尔奖的梦想。

    you'll learn that Gaddis can't finish even a short nonfiction piece without breaking
    into a rant. You'll find essays consisting of strung-together quotes that you
    have to read carefully, twice, before you conclude that no argument (or, indeed,
    logic) is hidden in the string.You'll see that, sure enough, literary difficulty
    can operate as a smoke screen for an author who has nothing interesting, wise,
    or entertaining to say. You'll find not one reference to the pleasure of reading
    fiction. You'll learn, rather, that Gaddis believed that novels should improve
    the world that good fiction is not about "the way things are" but about "the way
    things should be." You'll learn that the phrase "agape agape" refers to his belief
    that the world of Contract, the American world of dollars and machines, has ripped
    apart the charitable love (*agape*) to which early-Christian communities aspired.

    expect to work; I *want* to work. It's also in my Protestant nature, however,
    to expect some reward for this work. And, although critics can give me pastoral
    guidance as I seek this reward, ultimately I think each individual is alone with

- en: After "The Recognitions," however, something happened to Gaddis. Some-thing
    went haywire. Whether it's true or not, I tell myself a story about a five-year-old
    boy who was "in the way," about a skinny young man who, like Hamlet inscribing
    his stepfather's villainy on his brain, assembled an encyclopedia of phonyness
    unparalleled in literature. He confided his faith and hope to a nine-hundred-and-fifty-six-page-thick
    vault, and he gave the grownup world one chance to recognize him. When the world,
    inevitably, failed this test, he took his talent to the archetypically phony work
    of corporate P.R., as if to say, "You'll never catch me hoping again." The modern
    cry of pain became the postmodern bitter joke. The corporate P.R. work was vile,
    but at least he was conscious of its vileness. Indeed, the essence of postmodernism
    is an adolescent fear of getting taken in, an adolescent conviction that all systems
    are phony. The theory is compelling, but as a way of life it's a recipe for rage.
