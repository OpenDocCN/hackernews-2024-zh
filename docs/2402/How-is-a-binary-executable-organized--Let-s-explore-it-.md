# How is a binary executable organized? Let's explore it!

> 来源：[https://jvns.ca/blog/2014/09/06/how-to-read-an-executable/](https://jvns.ca/blog/2014/09/06/how-to-read-an-executable/)

I used to think that executables were totally impenetrable. I’d compile a C program, and then that was it! I had a Magical Binary Executable that I could no longer read.

It is not so! Executable file formats are regular file formats that you can understand. I’ll explain some simple tools to start! We’ll be working on Linux, with ELF binaries. (binaries are kind of the definition of platform-specific, so this is all platform-specific.) We’ll be using C, but you could just as easily look at output from any compiled language.

Let’s write a simple C program, `hello.c`:

```
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    printf("Penguin!\n");
} 
```

Then we compile it (`gcc -o hello hello.c`), and we have a binary called `hello`. This originally seems impenetrable (how do we even binary?!), but let’s see how we can investigate it! We’re going to learn what **symbols**, **sections**, and **segments** are. At a high level:

*   **symbols** are like function names, and are used to answer “If I call `printf` and it’s defined somewhere else, how do I find it?”
*   symbols are organized into **sections** – code lives in one section (`.text`), and data in another (`.data`, `.rodata`)
*   sections are organized into **segments**

Throughout we’ll use a tool called `readelf` to look at these.

So, let’s dive into our binary!

## Step 1: open it in a text editor!

This is most naive possible way to view a binary. If run `cat hello`, I get something like this:

```
ELF>@@H@8
@@@@@@��88@@@@�� ((`(`�
PP`P`��P�td@,,Q�tdR�td((`(`��/lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2GNUGNUϨ�n��8�w�j7*oL�h��

L�t$(L�|$0H��8��Ð�������������UH��SH�H�
H���t�(`DH���H�H���u�H�[]Ð�H��o���H��Penguin!;,����H

```

There’s text here, though! This was not a total failure. In particular it says “Penguin!” and “ELF”. ELF is the name of the binary format. So that’s something! Then there are a bunch of unprintable symbols, which isn’t a huge surprise because this is a binary.

## Step 2: use `readelf` to see the symbol table

Throughout we’re going to use a tool called `readelf` to explore our binary. Let’s start by running `readelf --symbols` on it. (another popular tool to do this is `nm`)

```
$ readelf --symbols hello 
   Num:    Value          Size Type    Bind   Vis      Ndx Name
    48: 0000000000000000     0 FUNC    GLOBAL DEFAULT  UND puts@@GLIBC_2.2.5
    59: 0000000000400410     0 FUNC    GLOBAL DEFAULT   13 _start
    61: 00000000004004f4    16 FUNC    GLOBAL DEFAULT   13 main 
```

([full output here](https://gist.github.com/jvns/0f82a7655d32bb6b331e))

Here we see three *symbols*: `main` is the address of my `main()` function. `puts` looks like a reference to the `printf` function I called in it (which I guess the compiler changed to `puts` as an optimization?). `_start` is pretty important.

When the program starts running, you might think it starts at `main`. It doesn’t! It *actually* goes to `_start`. This does a bunch of Very Important Things that I don’t understand very well, including calling `main`. So I won’t explain them.

So, what’s a symbol?

### Symbols

When you write a program, you might write a function called `hello`. When you compile the program, the binary for that function is labelled with a **symbol** called `hello`. If I call a function (like `printf`) from a library, we need a way to look up the code for that function! The process of looking up functions from libraries is called **linking**. It can happen either just after we compile the program (“static linking”) or when we run the program (“dynamic linking”).

So symbols are what allow linking to work! Let’s find the symbol for printf! It’ll be in `libc`, where all the C standard library functions are.

If I run `nm` on my copy of libc, it tells me “no symbols”. But the internet tells me I can use `objdump -tT` instead! This works! `objdump -tT /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc-2.15.so` gives me [this output](https://gist.github.com/jvns/13bae55c3d463cdad809).

If you look at it, you’ll see `sprintf`, `strlen`, `fork`, `exec`, and everything you might expect libc to have. From here we can start to imagine how dynamic linking works – we see that `hello` calls `puts`, and then we can look up the location of `puts` in libc’s symbol table.

## Step 3: use `objdump` to see the binary, and learn about sections!

Opening our binary in a text editor was a bad way to open it. `objdump` is a better way. Here’s an excerpt:

```
$ objdump -s hello
Contents of section .text:
 400410 31ed4989 d15e4889 e24883e4 f0505449  1.I..^H..H...PTI
 400420 c7c0a005 400048c7 c1100540 0048c7c7  ....@.H....@.H..
 400430 f4044000 e8c7ffff fff49090 4883ec08  ..@.........H...
Contents of section .interp:
 400238 2f6c6962 36342f6c 642d6c69 6e75782d  /lib64/ld-linux-
 400248 7838362d 36342e73 6f2e3200           x86-64.so.2\.    
Contents of section .rodata:
 4005f8 01000200 50656e67 75696e21 00        ....Penguin!. 
```

You can see that it shows us all the bytes in the file as hex on the left, and a translation into ASCII on the right.

The are a whole bunch of **sections** here (see [this gist](https://gist.github.com/jvns/64aa2c85e083e0031609) for the whole thing). This shows you all the bytes in your binary! Some sections we care about:

*   `.text` is the program’s actual code (the assembly). `_start` and `main` are both part of the `.text` section.
*   `.rodata` is where some read-only data is stored (in this case, our string “Penguin!”)
*   `.interp` is the filename of the dynamic linker!

The major difference between *sections* and *segments* is that sections are used at link time (by `ld`) and segments are used at execution time. `objdump` shows us the contents of the sections, which is nice, but doesn’t give us as much metadata about the sections as I’d like. Let’s try `readelf` instead:

```
$ readelf --sections hello
Section Headers:

  I (info), L (link order), G (group), T (TLS), E (exclude), x (unknown)

```

([full output](https://gist.github.com/jvns/37ce4ad26758b403f6b3))

Neat! We can see `.text` is executable and read-only, `.rodata` (“read only data”) is read-only, and `.data` is read-write.

## Step 4: Look at some assembly!

We mentioned briefly that `.text` contains assembly code. We can actually look at what it is really easily. If we were magicians, we would already be able to read and understand this:

```
Contents of section .text:
 400410 31ed4989 d15e4889 e24883e4 f0505449  1.I..^H..H...PTI
 400420 c7c0a005 400048c7 c1100540 0048c7c7  ....@.H....@.H..
 400430 f4044000 e8c7ffff fff49090 4883ec08  ..@.........H... 
```

It starts with `31ed4989`. Those are bytes that our CPU interprets as code! And runs! However we are not magicians (I don’t know what `31 ed` means!) and so we will use a disassembler instead.

```
$ objdump -d ./hello
Disassembly of section .text:

0000000000400410 <_start>:
  400410:       31 ed                   xor    %ebp,%ebp
  400412:       49 89 d1                mov    %rdx,%r9
  400415:       5e                      pop    %rsi
  400416:       48 89 e2                mov    %rsp,%rdx
  400419:       48 83 e4 f0             and    $0xfffffffffffffff0,%rsp 
```

[full output here](https://gist.github.com/jvns/75298b0a5b6cde5de175)

So we see that `31 ed` is xoring two things. Neat! That’s all the assembly we’ll do for now.

## Step 5: Segments!

Finally, a program is organized into **segments** or **program headers**. Let’s look at the segments for our program using `readelf --segments hello`.

```
Program Headers:
  [... removed ...]
  INTERP         0x0000000000000238 0x0000000000400238 0x0000000000400238
                 0x000000000000001c 0x000000000000001c  R      1

                 0x00000000000001f8 0x0000000000000208  RW     200000
  [... removed ...]

 Section to Segment mapping:
  Segment Sections...
   00     
   01     .interp 
   02 .interp .note.ABI-tag .note.gnu.build-id .gnu.hash .dynsym
       .dynstr .gnu.version .gnu.version_r .rela.dyn .rela.plt .init .plt
       .text .fini .rodata .eh_frame_hdr .eh_frame
   03     .ctors .dtors .jcr .dynamic .got .got.plt .data .bss 
   04     .dynamic 
   05     .note.ABI-tag .note.gnu.build-id 
   06     .eh_frame_hdr 
   07     
   08     .ctors .dtors .jcr .dynamic .got 
```

Segments are used to determine how to separate different parts of the program into memory. The first `LOAD` segment is marked R E (read / execute) and the second is `RW` (read/write). `.text` is in the first segment (we want to read it but never write to it), and `.data`, `.bss` are in the second (we need to write to them, but not execute them).

## Not magic!

Executables aren’t magic. ELF is a file format like any other! You can use `readelf`, `nm`, and `objdump` to inspect your Linux binaries. Try it out! Have fun.
