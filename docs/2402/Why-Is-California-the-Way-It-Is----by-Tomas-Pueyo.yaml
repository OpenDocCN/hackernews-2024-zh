    bay that was not even discovered by the Spaniards until the 1700s. There are much
    better spots for a regional capital on that bay. Why did SF become the center
    of the Bay Area?

    in Coloma. Why there? Because it was at the base of the mountains. Logs could
    be floated down there.

    had established a settlement at the **confluence** of the Sacramento and American
    Rivers.

    allowing gold to be traded outward, and other goods to reach the region via the
    ocean and the Sacramento River. In other words, Sacramento was the main trading
    port for the California mountains with the world.

    and its fog. Meanwhile, the South Bay is flat, warm, and broad. Over time, as
    more and more of the Bay Area was built out, this became a huge advantage, and
    today the city of San Jose is bigger than San Francisco.
