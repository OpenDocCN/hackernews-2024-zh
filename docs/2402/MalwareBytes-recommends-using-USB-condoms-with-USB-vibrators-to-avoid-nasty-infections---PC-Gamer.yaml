- en: Though you (probably) can't get the biological kind of infection from your personal
    sex toy of choice, apparently you can get the virtual kind. Dodgy cybercriminals
    are always looking for new ways to rip people off, and one of the latest examples
    comes courtesy of a vibrator. Yes, cyber-STDs are a thing.

    (the original post has since been deleted) saying their Malwarebytes app blocked
    malware from installing after connecting a vibrator to a [USB](https://www.pcgamer.com/uk/tag/usb/)
    port in order to charge the device. The vibrator in question is a Spencer's Pussy
    Power 8-function rechargeable bullet. According to the [Spencer's website](https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=92X590208&xcust=pcg_gb_1408476884878459471&xs=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.spencersonline.com%2Fproduct%2Fpussy-power-8-function-rechargeable-bullet-vibrator-4-inch-sexology%2F217682.uts&sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pcgamer.com%2Fmalwarebytes-recommends-using-usb-condoms-with-usb-vibrators-to-avoid-nasty-infections),
    the model in question has over 150 reviews and a near five-star rating, meaning
    more than a few of these dangerous little kitties are sitting in underwear drawers
    already.

    which is an information-stealer. It can obtain information such as login credentials,
    [cryptocurrency](https://www.pcgamer.com/uk/tag/cryptocurrency/) wallet data,
    and two-factor authentication details.

    with the technical details of the attack. It has reached out to Spencer's, though
    the company had yet to reply at the time of writing. The question I have is why
    would a vibrator or any other type of device that uses USB for charging need USB-accessible
    memory at all?

- en: How does one go about avoiding nasty cyber-STDs? The best advice is to use a
    good old wall socket to charge your devices. But, if you can't be safe, be careful.
    The next best option is to use a so-called ['USB condom'](https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=8432&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Fs%3Fk%3DUSB%2Bdata%2Bblocker%26tag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dpcg-gb-8717380390955151047-20).
    These little devices block any data transfer, ensuring that power only is transferred
    to your device. They're particularly useful if you use public charging ports or
    stations.
