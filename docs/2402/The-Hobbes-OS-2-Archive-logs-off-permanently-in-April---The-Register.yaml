- en: The Hobbes OS/2 site has been around for decades and contains a vast array of
    software for IBM's doomed operating system. For enthusiasts of the operating system,
    the website is the go-to place to find software. As such, its impending demise
    is bad news for the OS/2 community, although [efforts are under way](https://mastodon.archive.org/@textfiles/111728995296654678)
    to preserve the archive. The service may also be continued elsewhere.

- en: OS/2 was initially conceived as a series of operating systems by Microsoft and
    IBM. The two tech giants fell out over where the operating system stood in relation
    to Windows 3.1\. While OS/2 was arguably technically superior to Windows 95, it
    was eventually overtaken by Windows NT. IBM finally threw in the towel in 2001.

    attempted to download what they could. Since the end isn't until April, there
    is plenty of time to make alternative arrangements.

- en: The sunsetting of the Hobbes OS/2 Archive is an unwanted milestone on the OS/2
    journey. Users took the opportunity to share their own IT travels involving the
    operating system, with many noting that OS/2 represented a gateway into the Linux
    world. ®

    made the difficult decision to no longer host these files on hobbes.nmsu.edu.
    Although I am unable to go into specifics, we had to evaluate our priorities and
    had to make the difficult decision to discontinue the service. “We tried to pick
    a date far enough out to provide the community time to gather the files and find
    a new home. It has been fascinating to see the stories people have shared about
    this server. “The NMSU team that is currently supporting [the] server is trying
    their best to meet the needs of the community. We have provided additional resources
    for Hobbes as there was a clear spike in traffic after the announcement. If we
    have additional information, we will update Hobbes.nmsu.edu.”'
