    been hard to find. The government estimates that 3,522 people [died because of
    it](https://www.nhtsa.gov/risky-driving/distracted-driving#:~:text=Distracted%20driving%20is%20dangerous%2C%20claiming,us%20keep%20America's%20roads%20safe.)
    in 2021, but experts say the official number probably majorly undercounts the
    number of deaths, in part because police are rarely able to definitively prove
    that a driver was distracted right before a crash.

    [Cambridge Mobile Telematics](https://www.cmtelematics.com/) is a company that
    partners with major insurance companies to offer downloadable apps that drivers
    can use to save money on their rates. Via the apps, Cambridge Mobile Telematics
    (CMT) uses mobile phone sensors to measure driving behavior, including whether
    a person is speeding, holding their phone, or interacting with an unlocked screen
    while driving (the company says it doesn’t collect information on what the drivers
    are doing on their phones). Its work gives the company insight into the driving
    behaviors of more than 10 million people.
