    and the system that gives your finger feedback when you touch a virtual button
    may be relatively small, but they are still big enough to limit how thin our mobile
    devices can get. These little components are also delicate, as you may have learned
    if you have dropped your phone. And they require openings in the enclosure that
    can admit moisture or debris.

    usually sit on the sides or back of our devices. The sound is supposed to be coming
    from the image that our eyes see on the screen, but our ears know it’s coming
    from somewhere else. This perceptual dissonance limits our ability to immerse
    ourselves in the experience.

    itself as the source of sound and haptic feedback. The technology to do this is
    now available—it’s a thin piezoelectric transducer. And it’s going to be moving
    into mobile phones, laptops, and wearables by the end of this year.

- en: Traditional speakers function by running a current through a coil, creating
    a magnetic field that moves a magnet attached to the speaker cone, which in turn
    displaces air to create a sound wave. The speaker can be no smaller than is allowed
    by the size of the coil and the cone, which must be wide enough and long enough
    to displace a reasonable volume of air. Its mechanical durability is limited by
    the precision with which its small moving parts must be assembled.

    of a mobile device. The display is a uniform, flat, semiflexible surface–If you
    tap on it with a fingernail, you can hear it vibrate. The technology to turn flat,
    semiflexible surfaces into loudspeakers dates to the early years of high fidelity.

    into motion—the coil and piston—and attach the piston to a wall or the panel of
    a cabinet. The wall or panel then vibrated—like a speaker cone—creating the air-pressure
    waves we perceive as sound. That idea remained a novelty, mainly because it was
    a do-it-yourself project with unpredictable results. Finding the right surface,
    mounting the driver in the right place, and powering it properly turned out to
    be about as easy as building a really good violin.

    TVs into speakers using a similar principle. They use powerful transducers to
    vibrate the whole display panel at audio frequencies. This delivers the goods:
    thin displays, no speakers. According to reviewers, the fidelity is great at midrange
    and high frequencies (if you want low frequencies, you’ll want a supplementary
    subwoofer). And the sound really does seem to be coming from the images on the
    screen. But these systems are expensive and require high-voltage amplifiers that
    consume considerable power, so they need to be shrunk before they can fit into
    a mobile device.'

- en: To do the job in smaller devices you need piezoelectric transducers. These are
    made up of tiny single crystals, such as quartz or some ceramics, with two electrodes
    attached. When you apply a voltage across the electrodes, the material physically
    bends.
  id: totrans-split-18
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That bending is called the converse piezoelectric effect. In 1880, physicists
    Pierre and Jacques Curie observed that when certain crystals were subjected to
    mechanical force, a voltage would appear between the faces of the crystal; they
    called this the piezoelectric effect ( *piezo* is Greek for “to press”). This
    effect is due to the interaction between natural electric dipoles in the crystals
    and mechanical stresses in the crystals’ molecules. Roughly speaking, bending
    the crystal causes the dipoles to align, creating a bulk electric field.

    was applied between the faces of these crystals, the dipoles would bend the crystal
    as they try to align with the field. Work on piezoelectric materials subsequently
    expanded to include ceramics.'

    rather considerable force. These vibrations can be slow—the kind needed for haptic
    feedback—or very fast, to the highest audio frequencies and beyond. While creating
    the effect with ceramic material requires relatively high voltages—in the range
    of 40 volts or more—it requires very little current and, hence, little power—far
    less than the power used by mobile device speakers today.

    is a long way from making a smoke alarm screech. There are a number of challenges
    to making it work in a handheld device. There is the need for an amplifier able
    to step up the voltage that batteries can provide, with high efficiency to conserve
    energy, and with minimum noise, to preserve audio quality. And the audio signal
    needs some preprocessing before you send it to the transducer, to correct for
    the characteristics of the transducer and the display panel that the transducer
    will shake.

    challenges. We’ve developed a chip that incorporates a low-noise, high-voltage
    boost amplifier and a digital signal processor that sits on a device’s main board
    and drives a ceramic piezoelectric transducer attached to the back of the display.
    This does take up space, but then again, it eliminates the moving coil speaker.
    The exact placement and number of these amplifier-transducer sets depends on the
    mechanical design of the device and the desired audio modes—one set is enough
    to replace the handheld receiver functionality in a smartphone, but a second set
    will be needed to also replace the speakerphone function. That configuration will
    be the more typical one.

    are many. The piezoelectric transducer material requires only one millimeter of
    enclosure thickness, compared to several millimeters for dynamic speakers or linear
    resonant actuators, enabling a new generation of thinner handheld devices. Yet
    such transducers can produce the sound quality and the loudness of the best miniature
    dynamic speakers. They are being made by a few companies, including [TDK](https://www.tdk.com/en/index.html);
    others have yet to be announced publicly.

    display. This means the sound is directed at the user, not away from the user
    or off to the side. As the success of sound-generating displays in large-screen
    TVs has demonstrated, this does in fact provide a more immersive experience. When
    you see the T-Rex throw back its head and roar, your brain locates the source
    of the sound at the image of the beast, not somewhere off to the side.

- en: Many of today’s handheld devices do attempt to correct for this problem by what
    is called [psychoacoustic processing](https://spectrum.ieee.org/3d-audio), using
    an algorithm to change the amplitude and phase of the sound waves coming from
    the speakers, mimicking some of the very complex things that your ears do as sound
    waves enter them from different directions. The success of these algorithms depends
    on the surroundings, and extra processor cycles take noticeable energy from the
    device’s battery. Having the sound physically originate on the display is a far
    simpler solution.

    the display panel, not only can a conventional touch sensor determine where you
    are touching, but the piezoelectric transducer can tell how hard you are pressing.
    This opens a whole new realm of feedback for interactive user interfaces and immersive
    touchscreen games.

    explored yet. When a touch, or even reasonably loud ambient noise, flexes the
    display panel, it will also flex the transducer, generating a voltage. This electrical
    signal could be harvested to charge the device’s battery, providing a level of
    [energy harvesting](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7503403) that might prolong
    the time between charges.
