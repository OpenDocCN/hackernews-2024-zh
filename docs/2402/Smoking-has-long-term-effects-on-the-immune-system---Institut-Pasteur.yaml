    on immune responses. This is the finding recently made by a team of scientists
    at the Institut Pasteur using the** [***Milieu Intérieur***](https://www.milieuinterieur.fr/fr/)
    **cohort of 1,000 healthy volunteers, established to understand variability in
    immune responses. In addition to its short-term impact on immunity, smoking also
    has long-term consequences. For many years after they have quit the habit, smokers
    are left with effects on some of their bodies'' defense mechanisms acquired while
    smoking. These findings, which for the first time reveal a long-term memory of
    the effects of smoking on immunity, were published in the journal [*Nature*](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06968-8)
    on February 14, 2024.**'

- en: Individuals' immune systems vary significantly in terms of how effectively they
    respond to microbial attacks. But how can this variability be explained? What
    factors cause these differences? "To answer this key question, we set up the *Milieu
    Intérieur* cohort comprising 1,000 healthy individuals aged 20 to 70 in 2011,"
    comments Darragh Duffy, Head of the Translational Immunology Unit at the Institut
    Pasteur and last author of the study. While certain factors such as age, sex and
    genetics are known to have a significant impact on the immune system, the aim
    of this new study was to identify which other factors had the most influence."

    Intérieur* cohort to a wide variety of microbes (viruses, bacteria, etc.) and
    observed their immune response by measuring levels of secreted cytokines^((1)).
    Using the large quantities of data gathered for individuals in the cohort, the
    team then determined which of the 136 investigated variables (body mass index,
    smoking, number of hours'' sleep, exercise, childhood illnesses, vaccinations,
    living environment, etc.) had the most influence on the immune responses studied.
    Three variables stood out: smoking, latent cytomegalovirus infection^((2)) and
    body mass index. "The influence of these three factors on certain immune responses
    could be equal to that of age, sex or genetics," points out Darragh Duffy.'

- en: As regards smoking, an analysis of the data showed that the inflammatory response,
    which is immediately triggered by infection with a pathogen, was heightened in
    smokers, and moreover, the activity of certain cells involved in immune memory
    was impaired. In other words, this study shows that smoking disrupts not only
    innate immune mechanisms, but also some adaptive immune mechanisms.

- en: A comparison of immune responses in smokers and ex-smokers revealed that the
    inflammatory response returned to normal levels quickly after smoking cessation,
    while the impact on adaptive immunity persisted for 10 to 15 years. This is the
    first time it has been possible to demonstrate the long-term influence of smoking
    on immune responses.

- en: Basically, the immune system appears to have something resembling a long-term
    memory of the effects of smoking. But how? "When we realized that the profiles
    of smokers and ex-smokers were similar, we immediately suspected that epigenetic
    processes were at play^((3))," says Violaine Saint-André, a bioinformatician in
    the Institut Pasteur's Translational Immunology Unit and first author of the study.
    "We demonstrated that the long-term effects of smoking on immune responses were
    linked to differences in DNA methylation^((4)) – with the potential to modify
    the expression of genes involved in immune cell metabolism – between smokers,
    ex-smokers and non-smokers." It therefore appears that smoking can induce persistent
    changes to the immune system through epigenetic mechanisms.
