- en: Questions like “Which browser should I use?” regularly come up on the [r/browsers
    subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/browsers/). I sometimes respond to these posts,
    but my quick replies usually only contain one or two points. To be honest, until
    recently I wasn’t even sure myself why I use Firefox. Of course it’s a pretty
    good browser, but that doesn’t explain why I’ve stubbornly stayed loyal to Firefox
    for more than a decade. After giving it a bit more thought, I came up with the
    following reasons.

- en: 1\. The *about:config* page
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In Firefox, there is an internal *about:config* page with thousands (tens of
    thousands?) of individual configs that can be freely edited by the user. If you
    don’t like a particular UI element or behavior in Firefox, there’s a good chance
    that you can change it with a config. The *about:config* page is also used to
    individually enable experimental web platform features (without requiring a browser
    restart like in Chrome).

- en: 2\. Mozilla cannot decrypt my data on their servers
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: All the major browsers have a feature for syncing the user’s browsing data across
    devices (Firefox Sync, Chrome Sync, Apple iCloud, and so on). The user’s data
    is stored on the browser vendor’s servers, and this data is of course encrypted.
    But can the browser vendor decrypt this data? Google can. Apple claims that they
    can’t, but they have disclosed user data to law enforcement in the past, so I
    don’t trust them. Mozilla says that they can’t, and I trust them.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It seems that Mozilla goes out of their way to make absolutely sure that they
    can’t access the synced browsing data of Firefox users. The encryption is strong
    enough that with current technology it would take trillions of years to break
    into this data, so it’s pretty safe. However, if I somehow managed to lose all
    my devices where I’ve activated Firefox Sync, my browsing data on Mozilla’s servers
    would be lost forever; there would be no way of recovering it. Still, I like the
    idea of using a browser from a company that does not *want* to access my data
    on their own servers. I feel like this is how it should be.

- en: 3\. Translating web pages is also completely private
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Firefox Translations is a relatively new feature that allows users to translate
    web pages to a different language (from a small set of supported languages) directly
    in the browser, without sending any data to any servers. This feature is based
    on machine learning and neural networks.

    privacy.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Firefox uses Mozilla’s Gecko browser engine. No other major browser uses Gecko.
    The web is my favorite platform, and since a diversity of browser engines is good
    for the web*, I want to support Gecko. By using Firefox and reporting Firefox
    and web compat bugs, I’m doing my part.

    developers. For example, features like WebGL and IndexedDB are only supported
    in some WebKit-based browsers. Understanding WebKit for Developers helps explain
    the details, like why `<video>`, fonts and 3D transforms implementations vary
    across WebKit browsers.

    have a high level of compatibility. We’re adopting a similar approach to Mozilla
    by having a distinct yet compatible open-source engine. We will also continue
    to have open bug tracking and implementation status so you can see and contribute
    to what we’re working on at any time.

    From the long-term perspective, however, monocultures inevitably lead to stagnation.
    It is our firm belief that more options in rendering engines will lead to more
    innovation and a healthier web ecosystem.

- en: Bringing a new browser engine into the world increases diversity. Though that
    in itself isn't our goal, it has the beneficial effect of ensuring that multiple
    interoperable implementations of accepted standards exist. Each engine will approach
    the same problem from a different direction, meaning that web developers can be
    more confident in the performance and security characteristics of the end result.
    It also makes it less likely that one implementation's quirks become de facto
    standards, which is good for the open web at large.
  prefs:

- en: I couldn’t have said it better. We currently have three major browser engines—and
    a couple of smaller ones in development—and of those three, Gecko is the only
    one that may be at risk. I’m not sure what Gecko’s [conservation status](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservation_status)
    would be if it were a real animal (probably “Conservation Dependent”), but I don't
    plan on giving up on it anytime soon.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The web has unfortunately become slower and more annoying over the past decade.
    Extensions that block ads and other types of problematic content have become necessary
    to have a normal web browsing experience. On Android, Firefox has by far the best
    support for browser extensions. This includes uBlock Origin (the best ad-blocker)
    and extensions for adding user styles and user scripts to websites. I actively
    use all of these extensions (uBlock Origin, [Stylus](https://add0n.com/stylus.html),
    Tampermonkey) on desktop to tweak websites to my liking. It is awesome that Firefox
    users on Android can do the same.

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I should probably finally mention an actual feature in Firefox that a regular
    user might find useful. I don’t really use Firefox for its general features, but
    if there’s one such feature that I really like, it’s the native picture-in-picture
    video player in desktop Firefox, which is superb. It has everything that one could
    ask for. It can be quickly opened via an overlay button that is shown when hovering
    any video. It can be resized and positioned anywhere on the screen. It has the
    full controls, including pause, mute, and the seek bar for skipping to any point
    in the video. I use it all the time.

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I trust Mozilla more than I trust Google, Apple, Microsoft, or any other company
    that makes web browsers. This trust is based on the fact that Mozilla chooses
    the highest level of user privacy when developing services such as Firefox Sync,
    Firefox Translate, and others. A web browser is an integral part of a person’s
    online life, so it makes sense to choose a browser from a company that one trusts
    the most.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In addition to that, Firefox offers the highest level of customization, whether
    it’s through browser extensions or internal configs. This is important to me because
    I prefer websites over native apps.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Any great feature, such as the picture-in-picture player, is just the cherry
    on top. I understand that for most people it’s probably the other way around.
    They care about features more than they care about privacy and customization.
    That is fine. There is no wrong answer. Everyone should use the browser that serves
    them best.
