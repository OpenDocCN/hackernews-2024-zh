    Lordy, I get so tired of that trope. Don‚Äôt like Emacs? I‚Äôm fine with that. Sorry
    you‚Äôre missing out, but fine. What I‚Äôm not fine with is people who don‚Äôt like
    Emacs and probably have never used it seriously declaring it a spent force. To
    be fair, redditisinmyheart doesn‚Äôt appear to fall into that category and seems
    to be asking an honest question rather than making an ill informed statement but
    most people declaring Emacs dead don‚Äôt know what they‚Äôre talking about.'

- en: The answer to the first question is an unequivocal ‚ÄúNo‚Äù. Org Mode, Magit, Native
    Compilation, Treesitter, LSP, and tons of lesser improvements are happening all
    the time. Lately, the Emacs developers are making major releases about once a
    year and smaller releases regularly. Meanwhile, all those ‚Äúvibrant editors‚Äù are
    still trying to clone Org and Magit

    the introduction of major new features has accelerated lately. Regardless, it‚Äôs
    clearly not the case that development has slowed or stalled.

    a Red Meat Friday post. Again, I don‚Äôt have figures but it‚Äôs my impression that
    Emacs usage as a percentage of the possible user base *has* shrunk. Partly, that‚Äôs
    because there are many more choices now, but also because the nature of the user
    base has changed.

    and those who answered the call were willing and even eager to expend major effort
    in honing their craft. That included spending the time to master ‚Äúdifficult‚Äù editors
    like Emacs and Vi. There are still plenty of people like that, of course, but
    there are also a lot of people to whom it‚Äôs only a job to be gotten through with
    the least effort possible. *Of course* users in the latter group aren‚Äôt going
    to spend the effort to master Emacs when they can simply use VS Code instead.
    No steep learning curves; Just buttons to push and a lot of bling to make it look
    really cool.

    that could have qualified. It posited that [serious programmers use Emacs, Vim,
    or (on the Mac) TextMate](https://irreal.org/blog/?p=697). It got a bit of pushback
    but I think its point remains valid and probably speaks to why the percentage
    of Emacs users has shrunk.
