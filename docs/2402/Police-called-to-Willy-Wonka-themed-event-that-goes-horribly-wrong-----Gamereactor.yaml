    numerous complaints from families. [Police were eventually called](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/czrlr3dw2x3o)
    over the complaints, which saw the families wanting full refunds from the House

    it! The event was said to be a *"journey filled with wondrous creations and enchanting
    surprises at every turn."* AI-generated art was used to advertise the event, but
    when families turned up, they saw some foam sweets, a bouncy castle, and little
    else that transformed the warehouse the event was held in.

    Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/houseofilluminatiofficial), claiming that the
    organisers were let down at the last minute in many areas of the event. Full refunds
    are expected to be given out to everyone who attended, or those who weren't even
    able to see this experience due to it being cancelled midway through the day.

    to this world of anything but pure imagination, you can vent your trauma with
