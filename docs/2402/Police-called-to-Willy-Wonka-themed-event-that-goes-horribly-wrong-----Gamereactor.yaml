  zh: 所谓的“威利·旺卡体验”在周末被关闭，因为来自家庭的大量投诉。[最终警方介入](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/czrlr3dw2x3o)，因为家庭希望从伊路米纳蒂活动公司获得全额退款。
- en: Want to hear the full story? Quiet up and listen down. Wait, scratch that! Reverse
    it! The event was said to be a *"journey filled with wondrous creations and enchanting
    surprises at every turn."* AI-generated art was used to advertise the event, but
    when families turned up, they saw some foam sweets, a bouncy castle, and little
    else that transformed the warehouse the event was held in.

    are expected to be given out to everyone who attended, or those who weren't even
