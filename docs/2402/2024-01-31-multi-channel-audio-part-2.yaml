- en: Last time, we left off at the fact that modern films are distributed with their
    audio in multiple formats. Most of the time, there is a stereo version of the
    audio, and a multi-channel version of the audio that is perhaps 5.1 or 7.1 and
    compressed using one of several codecs that were designed within the film industry
    for this purpose.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But that was all about film, in physical form. In the modern world, films go
    out to theaters in the form of Digital Cinema Packages, a somewhat elaborate format
    that basically comes down to an encrypted motion JPEG 2000 stream with PCM audio.
    There are a lot of details there that I don't know very well and I don't want
    to get hung up on anyway, because I want to talk about the consumer experience.

- en: As a consumer, there are a lot of ways you get movies. If you are a weirdo,
    you might buy a Blu-Ray disc. Optical discs are a nice case, because they tend
    to conform to a specification that allows relatively few options (so that players
    are reasonable to implement). Blu-Ray are allowed to encode their audio as linear
    PCM [1], Dolby Digital, Dolby TrueHD, DTS, DTS-HD, or DRA.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: DRA is a common standard in the Chinese market but not in the US (that's where
    *I* live), so I'll ignore it. That still leaves three basic families of codecs,
    each of which have some variations. One of the interesting things about the Blu-Ray
    specification is that PCM audio can incorporate up to eight channels. The Blu-Ray
    spec allows up to 27,648 Kbps of audio, so it's actually quite feasible to do
    uncompressed, 24-bit, 96 kHz, 7.1 audio on a Blu-Ray disc. This is an unusual
    capability in a consumer standard and makes the terribly named Blu-Ray High Fidelity
    Pure Audio standard for Blu-Ray audio discs make more sense. Stick a pin in that,
    though, because you're going to have a tough time actually playing uncompressed
    7.1.

    of those and half of them have inane names ending in Plus, so I'm going to simplify
    by pretending that we're back in 2012 and Netflix is all that really matters.
    We can infer from Netflix help articles that Netflix delivers audio as AAC or
    Dolby Digital.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Or, consider the case of video files that you obtained by legal means. I looked
    at a few of the movies on my NAS to take a rough sampling. Most older films, and
    some newer ones, have stereo AAC audio. Some have what VLC describes as A52 aka
    AC3\. A/52 is an ATSC standard that is equivalent to AC3, and AC-3 (hyphen inconsistent)
    is sort of the older name of Dolby Digital or the name of the underlying transport
    stream format, depending on how you squint at it. Less common, in my hodgepodge
    sample, is DTS, but I can find a few.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: VLC typically describes the DTS and Dolby Digital as 3F2M/LFE, which is a somewhat
    eccentric (and I think specific to VLC) notation for 5.1 surround. An interesting
    detail is that VLC differentiates 3F2M/LFE and 3F2R/LFE, both 5.1, but with the
    two "surround" channels assigned to either side or rear positions. While 5.1 configurations
    with the surround channels to the side seem to be more standard, you could potentially
    put the two surround channels to the rear. Some formats have channel mapping metadata
    that can differentiate the two.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Because there is no rest for the weary, there is some inconsistency between
    "5.1 side" and "5.1 rear" in different standards and formats. At the end of the
    day, most applications don't really differentiate. I tend to consider surround
    channels on the side to be "correct," in that movie theaters are configured that
    way and thus it's ostensibly the design target for films. One of few true specifications
    I could find for general use, rather than design standards specific to theaters
    like THX, is ITU-R BS 775\. It states that the surround channels of a 5.1 configuration
    should be mostly to the side, but slightly behind the listener.

    multi-channel stream. Most video containers today can support basically arbitrary
    numbers of streams, and you could put uncompressed multichannel audio into such
    a container if you wanted. And yet, multi-channel audio in films almost always
    comes in the form of a Dolby Digital or DTS stream. Why is that? Well, in part,
    because of tradition: they used to be the formats used by theaters, although digital
    cinema has somewhat changed that situation and the consumer versions have usually
    been a little different in the details. But the point stands, films are usually
    mastered in Dolby or DTS, so the "home video" release goes out with Dolby or DTS.'

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Let's talk a bit about interconnections. In a previous era of consumer audio,
    the age of "hi-fi," component systems dominated residential living rooms. In a
    component system, you had various audio sources that connected to a device that
    came to be known as a "receiver" since it typically had an FM/AM radio receiver
    integrated. It is perhaps more accurate to refer to it as an amplifier since that's
    the main role it serves in most modern systems, but there's also an increasing
    tendency to think of their input selection and DSP features as part of a preamp.
    The device itself is sometimes referred to as a preamp, in audiophile circles,
    when component amplifiers are used to drive the actual speakers. You can see that
    in these conventional component systems you need to move audio signals between
    devices. This kind of set up, though, is not common in households with fewer than
    four bathrooms and one swimming pool.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Most consumers today seem to have a television and, hopefully, some sort of
    audio device like a soundbar. Sometimes there are no audio interconnections at
    all! Often the only audio interconnection is from the TV to the soundbar via HDMI.
    Sometimes it's wireless! So audio interconnects as a topic can feel a touch antiquated
    today, but these interconnects still matter a lot in practice. First, they are
    often either the same as something used in industry or similar to something used
    in industry. Second, despite the increasing prevalence of 5.1 and 7.1 soundbar
    systems with wireless satellites, the kind of people with a large Blu-Ray collection
    are still likely to have a component home theater system. Third, legacy audio
    interconnects don't die that quickly, because a lot of people have an older video
    game console or something that they want to work with their new TV and soundbar,
    so manufacturers tend to throw in one or two audio interconnects even if they
    don't expect most consumers to use them.

- en: So let's think about how to transport multi-channel audio. An ancient tradition
    in consumer audio says that stereo audio will be sent between components on two
    sets of two-conductor cables terminated by RCA connectors. The RCA connector dates
    back to to the Radio Corporation of America and, apparently, at least 1937\. It
    remains in widespread service today. There are a surprising number of variations
    in this interconnect, in practice.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For one, the audio cables may be coaxial or just zipped up in a common jacket.
    Coaxial audio cables are a bit more expensive and a lot less flexible but admit
    less noise. There is a lot of confusion in this area because a particular digital
    transport we'll talk about later specified coaxial cables terminated in RCA connectors,
    but then is frequently used with non-coaxial cables terminated in RCA connectors,
    and for reasonable lengths usually still works fine. This has lead to a lot of
    consumer confusion and people thinking that any cable with RCA connectors is coaxial,
    when in fact, most of them are not. Virtually all of them are not. Unless you
    specifically paid more money to get a coaxial one, it's not, and even then sometimes
    it's not, because Amazon is a hotbed of scams.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Second, though these connections are routinely described as "line level" as
    if that means something, there is remarkably little standardization of the actual
    signaling. There are various conventions like 1.7v peak-to-peak and 2v peak-to-peak
    and about 1v peak-to-peak, and few consumer manufacturers bother to tell you which
    convention they have followed. There are also a surprising number of ways of expressing
    signaling levels, involving different measurement bases (peak vs RMS) and units
    (dBv vs dBu), making it a little difficult to interpret specifications when they
    are provided. This whole mess is just one of the reasons you find yourself having
    to make volume adjustments for different sources, or having to tune input levels
    on receivers with that option [2].
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But that's all sort of a tangent, the point here is multi-channel audio. You
    could, conceptually, move 5.1 over six RCA cables, or 7.1 over eight RCA cables.
    Home theater receivers used to give you this option, but much like analog HDTV
    connections, it has largely disappeared.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'There is one other analog option: remember Pro Logic, from the film soundtracks?
    that matrixed five channels into the analog stereo? Some analog formats like VHS
    and LaserDisc often had a Pro Logic soundtrack that could be "decoded" (really
    dematrixed) by a receiver with that capability, which used to be common. In this
    case you can transport multi-channel audio over your normal two RCA cables. The
    matrixing technique was always sort of cheating, though, and produces inferior
    results to actual multichannel interconnects. It''s no longer common either.'

    audio really took flight with the elegantly named Sony/Philips Digital Interface,
    or S/PDIF. S/PDIF specifies a digital format that is extremely similar to, but
    not quite the same as, a professional digital interconnect called AES3\. AES3
    is typically carried on a three-conductor (balanced) cable with XLR connectors,
    though, which are too big an expensive for consumer equipment. In one of the weirder
    decisions in the history of consumer electronics, one that I can only imagine
    came out of an intractable political fight, S/PDIF specified two completely different
    physical transports: one electrical, and one optical.'
  prefs: []

    In practice it is often used over non-coaxial cables with RCA connectors, which
    will usually work fine if the length is short and nothing nearby is too electrically
    noisy. S/PDIF over non-coaxial cables is "fine" in the same way that HDMI cables
    longer than you are tall are "fine." If it doesn't work reliably, try a more expensive
    cable and you'll probably be good.

    square connector called Toslink, originally for Toshiba Link, after the manufacturer
    that gave us the optical variant. Toslink is one of those great disappointments
    in consumer products. Despite the theoretical advantages of an optical interconnect,
    the extremely cheap cables used with Toslink mean it's mostly just worse than
    the electrical transport, especially when it comes to range [3].

    two channels of 16 bit samples at 44.1kHz. In fact, it can comfortably go further,

    rate more common of digital audio other than CDs. That''s for two channels, though.
    Make the leap to six channels for 5.1 and you are well beyond the capabilities
    of an S/PDIF transceiver.'

    audio onto the limited space of a 35mm film print, also very much exist in the
    world of S/PDIF. CDs brought us uncompressed digital audio remarkably early on,
    but also set sort of a constraint on the bitrate of digital audio streams that
    ensured the opposite in the world of multi-channel theatrical sound. It sort of
    makes sense, anyway. DTS soundtracks came on CDs!

    I use it at all any more, which is not something I expected to be saying this

    Details like eARC and the specific HDMI version have all kinds of impacts on what
    kind of audio can be carried, and the same is true for video as well. I am going
    to spare a lengthy diversion into the many variants of HDMI, which seem almost
    as numerous as those of USB, and talk about HDMI 2.1.
  prefs: []

    HDMI offers a lot more bandwidth for audio than S/PDIF. In fact, you can transport
    8 channels of uncompressed 24-bit PCM at 192kHz. That's about 37 Mbps, which is
    not that fast for a data transport but sure is pretty fast for an audio cable.
    Considering the bandwidth requirements for 4K video at 120Hz, though, it's only
    a minor ask. With HDMI, compression of audio is no longer necessary.

- en: One of the interesting implications of this whole thing is that audio stacks
    have to deal with multiple formats and figure out which format is in use. That's
    not really new, with Dolby Pro Logic you either had to turn it on/off with a switch
    or the receiver had to try to infer whether or not Pro Logic had been used to
    matrix a multichannel soundtrack to stereo. For S/PDIF, IEC 61937 standardizes
    a format that can be used to encapsulate a compressed audio stream with sufficient
    metadata to determine the type of compression. HDMI adopts the same standard to
    identify compressed audio streams (and, in general, HDMI audio is pretty much
    in the same bitstream format as good old S/PDIF, but you can have a lot more of
    it).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In practice, there are a lot of headaches around this format switching. For
    one, home theater receivers have to switch between decoding modes. They mostly
    do this transparently and without any fuss, but I've owned a couple that had occasional
    issues with losing track of which format was in use, leading to dropouts. Maybe
    related to signal dropouts but my current receiver has the same problem with internal
    sources, so it seems more like a software bug of some sort.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It's a lot more complicated when you get out of dedicated home theater devices,
    though. Consider the audio stack of a general-purpose operating system. First,
    PCs rarely have S/PDIF outputs, so we are virtually always talking about HDMI.
    For a surprisingly long time, common video cards had no support for audio over
    HDMI. This is fortunately a problem of the past, but unfortunately ubiquitous
    audio over HDMI means that your graphics drivers are now involved in the transport
    of audio, and graphics drivers are notoriously bad at reliably producing video,
    much less dealing with audio as a side business. I shudder to think of the hours
    of my life I have lost dealing with defects of AMD's DTS support.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Things are weird on the host software side, though. The operating system does
    not normally handle sound in formats even resembling Dolby Digital or DTS. So,
    when you play a video file with audio encoded in one of those formats, a "passthrough"
    feature is typically used to deliver the compressed stream directly to the audio
    (often actually video) device, without normal operating system intervention. We
    are reaching the point where this *mostly* just works but you will still notice
    some symptoms of the underlying complexity.

    forum threads about bash scripts to bypass PulseAudio, so things seem mostly unchanged.
  prefs: []

    audio interconnection is based around sinks detecting the mode used by the source.
    That means that your home theater receiver should figure out what your video player
    is doing, but your video player has no idea what your home theater receiver is
    doing. This manifests in maddening ways. Consider, for example, the number of
    blog posts I ran across (while searching for something else!) about how to make
    Netflix less quiet by disabling surround sound.

    setup is. But what if you don't have 5.1 speakers? In principal you could downmix
    the 5.1 back to stereo, and a lot of home theater receivers have DSP modes that
    do this (and in general downmix 5.1 or 7.1 to whatever speaker channels are active,
    good for people with less common setups like my own 3.1). But you'd have to turn
    that on, which means having a receiver or soundbar or whatever that is capable,
    understanding the issue, and knowing how to enable that mode. That is way more
    than your average Netflix watcher wants to think about any of this. In practice,
    setting the Netflix player to only ever provide stereo audio is an easier fix.

    source equalization. If you have a computer connected to a home theater receiver

    parallel audio stacks: "normal" audio that passes through the OS sound server
    and goes to the receiver as PCM, and "surround sound" that bypasses the OS sound
    server and goes to the receiver as Dolby Digital or DTS. It is very easy to have
    differences in levels, adjustments, latency, etc. between these two paths. The

    which is 7.1, but it's so similar to the non-plus variant that there isn't much

    soundtracks are starting to get very large so including two complete copies isn't
    very appealing. The consumer encoding of Atmos was selected to have direct backward
    compatibility to 7.1 systems, allowing normal playback on pre-Atmos equipment.

    compared to the audio channels) is used to describe the 3D position of specific
    sound sources. Consumer Atmos decoders cannot support as many objects as the theatrical
    version, so part of the process of mastering an Atmos film for home release is
    clustering nearby objects into groups that are then treated as a single object
    by the consumer Atmos decoder. One way to think about this is that Atmos is downmixed
    to 7.1, and in the process a metadata stream is created that can be used to upmix
    back to Atmos mostly correctly. If it sounds kind of like matrix encoding it kind
    of is, in effect, which is perhaps part of why Dolby's marketing materials are
    so insistent that it is *not* matrix encoding. To be fair it is a completely different
    implementation, but has a similar effect of reducing the channel separation compared
