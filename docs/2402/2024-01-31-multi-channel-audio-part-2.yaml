    audio in multiple formats. Most of the time, there is a stereo version of the
    audio, and a multi-channel version of the audio that is perhaps 5.1 or 7.1 and
    compressed using one of several codecs that were designed within the film industry
    for this purpose.

    out to theaters in the form of Digital Cinema Packages, a somewhat elaborate format

    you might buy a Blu-Ray disc. Optical discs are a nice case, because they tend
    to conform to a specification that allows relatively few options (so that players
    are reasonable to implement). Blu-Ray are allowed to encode their audio as linear
    PCM [1], Dolby Digital, Dolby TrueHD, DTS, DTS-HD, or DRA.

  zh: 作为消费者，你有很多种方式获取电影。如果你是怪胎，你可能会购买蓝光光盘。光盘是一个很好的例子，因为它们往往符合允许相对较少选项的规范（这样播放器的实现就是合理的）。蓝光允许将音频编码为线性PCM

- en: DRA is a common standard in the Chinese market but not in the US (that's where
    *I* live), so I'll ignore it. That still leaves three basic families of codecs,
    each of which have some variations. One of the interesting things about the Blu-Ray
    specification is that PCM audio can incorporate up to eight channels. The Blu-Ray
    spec allows up to 27,648 Kbps of audio, so it's actually quite feasible to do
    uncompressed, 24-bit, 96 kHz, 7.1 audio on a Blu-Ray disc. This is an unusual
    capability in a consumer standard and makes the terribly named Blu-Ray High Fidelity
    Pure Audio standard for Blu-Ray audio discs make more sense. Stick a pin in that,
    though, because you're going to have a tough time actually playing uncompressed
    7.1.

  zh: DRA是中国市场上的一种常见标准，但在美国（这就是*我*所在的地方）并非如此，所以我会忽略它。这仍然留下了三种基本的编解码器系列，每种都有一些变化。关于蓝光规范的一件有趣的事情是，PCM音频最多可以包含八个声道。蓝光规范允许最高达27648
    Kbps的音频，因此在蓝光光盘上实现未经压缩的、24位、96 kHz、7.1音频实际上是非常可行的。这在消费者标准中是一个不同寻常的能力，也使得糟糕地命名为蓝光高保真纯音频标准的蓝光音频光盘更有意义。不过，要注意，你将很难播放未经压缩的7.1音频。

    of those and half of them have inane names ending in Plus, so I'm going to simplify

    at a few of the movies on my NAS to take a rough sampling. Most older films, and
    some newer ones, have stereo AAC audio. Some have what VLC describes as A52 aka
    AC3\. A/52 is an ATSC standard that is equivalent to AC3, and AC-3 (hyphen inconsistent)
    is sort of the older name of Dolby Digital or the name of the underlying transport
    stream format, depending on how you squint at it. Less common, in my hodgepodge
    sample, is DTS, but I can find a few.

    eccentric (and I think specific to VLC) notation for 5.1 surround. An interesting
    detail is that VLC differentiates 3F2M/LFE and 3F2R/LFE, both 5.1, but with the
    two "surround" channels assigned to either side or rear positions. While 5.1 configurations
    with the surround channels to the side seem to be more standard, you could potentially
    put the two surround channels to the rear. Some formats have channel mapping metadata

    "5.1 side" and "5.1 rear" in different standards and formats. At the end of the
    day, most applications don't really differentiate. I tend to consider surround
    channels on the side to be "correct," in that movie theaters are configured that
    way and thus it's ostensibly the design target for films. One of few true specifications
    I could find for general use, rather than design standards specific to theaters
    like THX, is ITU-R BS 775\. It states that the surround channels of a 5.1 configuration

- en: 'That digression aside, it''s unsurprising that a video file could contain a
    multi-channel stream. Most video containers today can support basically arbitrary
    numbers of streams, and you could put uncompressed multichannel audio into such
    a container if you wanted. And yet, multi-channel audio in films almost always
    comes in the form of a Dolby Digital or DTS stream. Why is that? Well, in part,
    because of tradition: they used to be the formats used by theaters, although digital
    cinema has somewhat changed that situation and the consumer versions have usually
    been a little different in the details. But the point stands, films are usually

    the age of "hi-fi," component systems dominated residential living rooms. In a
    component system, you had various audio sources that connected to a device that
    came to be known as a "receiver" since it typically had an FM/AM radio receiver
    integrated. It is perhaps more accurate to refer to it as an amplifier since that's
    the main role it serves in most modern systems, but there's also an increasing
    tendency to think of their input selection and DSP features as part of a preamp.
    The device itself is sometimes referred to as a preamp, in audiophile circles,
    when component amplifiers are used to drive the actual speakers. You can see that
    in these conventional component systems you need to move audio signals between

    interconnects don't die that quickly, because a lot of people have an older video
    game console or something that they want to work with their new TV and soundbar,

    in consumer audio says that stereo audio will be sent between components on two
    sets of two-conductor cables terminated by RCA connectors. The RCA connector dates

    and about 1v peak-to-peak, and few consumer manufacturers bother to tell you which
    convention they have followed. There are also a surprising number of ways of expressing
    signaling levels, involving different measurement bases (peak vs RMS) and units

  zh: 当你脱离专用的家庭影院设备时，情况就变得更加复杂了。考虑一下通用操作系统的音频堆栈。首先，PC 很少有 S/PDIF 输出，所以我们几乎总是在谈论 HDMI。令人惊讶的是，很长一段时间里，常见的显卡都不支持
    HDMI 音频。这是一个过去的问题，但不幸的是，普及的 HDMI 音频意味着你的图形驱动程序现在也参与了音频的传输，而图形驱动程序以可靠地产生视频而闻名，更不用说处理音频了。一想到我曾经因为
    AMD 的 DTS 支持的缺陷而浪费的生命中的小时数，我就感到恐惧。
- en: Things are weird on the host software side, though. The operating system does
    not normally handle sound in formats even resembling Dolby Digital or DTS. So,
    when you play a video file with audio encoded in one of those formats, a "passthrough"
    feature is typically used to deliver the compressed stream directly to the audio
    (often actually video) device, without normal operating system intervention. We
    are reaching the point where this *mostly* just works but you will still notice
    some symptoms of the underlying complexity.

    audio interconnection is based around sinks detecting the mode used by the source.
    That means that your home theater receiver should figure out what your video player

    doing. This manifests in maddening ways. Consider, for example, the number of

    setup is. But what if you don't have 5.1 speakers? In principal you could downmix
    the 5.1 back to stereo, and a lot of home theater receivers have DSP modes that
    do this (and in general downmix 5.1 or 7.1 to whatever speaker channels are active,
    good for people with less common setups like my own 3.1). But you'd have to turn
    that on, which means having a receiver or soundbar or whatever that is capable,
    understanding the issue, and knowing how to enable that mode. That is way more
    than your average Netflix watcher wants to think about any of this. In practice,

    cost of a higher bitrate than older media and interconnects support. HDMI can
    easily handle these, and if you have a fairly new setup of a Blu-Ray player and
    recent home theater receiver connected by HDMI you should be able to enjoy a lossless
    digital soundtrack on films that were released with one. That's sort of the end

- en: When the audio is played back, an Atmos decoder then mixes the audio into channels
    on the fly, using whatever channels are available. Atmos allows the same soundtrack

    7.1 系统具有直接向后兼容性，允许在以前的全景声设备上进行正常播放。
- en: For Atmos-capable equipment, an extra PCM-like subchannel (at a reduced bitrate
    compared to the audio channels) is used to describe the 3D position of specific
    sound sources. Consumer Atmos decoders cannot support as many objects as the theatrical
    version, so part of the process of mastering an Atmos film for home release is
    clustering nearby objects into groups that are then treated as a single object
    by the consumer Atmos decoder. One way to think about this is that Atmos is downmixed
    to 7.1, and in the process a metadata stream is created that can be used to upmix
    back to Atmos mostly correctly. If it sounds kind of like matrix encoding it kind
    of is, in effect, which is perhaps part of why Dolby's marketing materials are
    so insistent that it is *not* matrix encoding. To be fair it is a completely different
    implementation, but has a similar effect of reducing the channel separation compared
    to the original source.

  zh: 对于支持 Atmos 的设备，会使用一个类似 PCM 的附加子通道（比音频通道的比特率降低）来描述特定声源的三维位置。消费者 Atmos 解码器无法支持与剧院版相同数量的对象，因此在为家庭发行的
    Atmos 电影进行母带处理的过程中，将附近的对象聚集成群，然后由消费者 Atmos 解码器将其视为单个对象的一部分。理解这一点的一种方式是，Atmos 被混音到
    7.1，而在此过程中创建了一个元数据流，可以用来基本正确地再次混音为 Atmos。如果听起来有点像矩阵编码，那么实际上也是如此，从效果上讲，这或许就是为什么杜比的市场材料如此坚决地否认它是*不*矩阵编码的一部分。公平地说，它是一种完全不同的实现方式，但与原始源相比，它具有类似减少通道分离的效果。
