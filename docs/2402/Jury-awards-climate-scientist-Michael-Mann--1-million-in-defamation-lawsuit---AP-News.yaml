- en: WASHINGTON (AP) — A jury on Thursday awarded $1 million to climate scientist
    Michael Mann who sued a pair of conservative writers 12 years ago after they compared
    his depictions of global warming to a convicted child molester.

    to fame for a graph first published in 1998 in the journal Nature that was dubbed
    the “hockey stick” for its dramatic illustration of a warming planet.

    writers Mann took to court for comments that he said affected his career and reputation
    in the U.S. and internationally.

    published a blog post by Rand Simberg, then a fellow at the organization, that
    compared investigations into Mann’s work to the case of Jerry Sandusky, a former
    assistant football coach at Penn State University who was convicted of sexually
    assaulting multiple children. At the time, Mann also worked at Penn State.

    leaked in 2009 in an incident that brought further scrutiny of the “hockey stick”
    graph, with skeptics claiming Mann manipulated data. Investigations by Penn State
    and others found no misuse of data by Mann, but his work continued to draw attacks,
    particularly from conservatives.

    instead of molesting children, he has molested and tortured data,” Simberg wrote.
    Another writer, Mark Steyn, later referenced Simberg’s article in his own piece
    in National Review, calling Mann’s research “fraudulent.”

    Steyn made false statements, awarding Mann $1 in compensatory damages from each
    writer. It awarded punitive damages of $1,000 from Simberg and $1 million from
    Steyn, after finding that the pair made their statements with “maliciousness,
    spite, ill will, vengeance or deliberate intent to harm.”

    Howes that he would be appealing the $1 million award in punitive damages, saying
    it would have to face “due process scrutiny.”

    assertion for which both defendants said Mann did not provide sufficient evidence.
    The writers countered during the trial that Mann instead became one of the world’s
    most well-known climate scientists in the years after their comments.

    at issue,” Steyn said on Thursday through his manager. “And today, after twelve
    years, the jury awarded him one dollar in compensatory damages.”

    said it was clear the jurors found that Steyn and Simberg had “recklessly disregarded
    the falsity of their statements.” She added that the discrepancy between what
    the jury awarded in compensatory and punitive damages could result in the judge
    reducing the punitive damages.
