    Even getting a network to cover every corner of a fairly modest house can be a
    challenge. That’s not a problem for Wi-Fi technology developed by the Australian
    startup [Morse Micro](https://www.morsemicro.com/), which just demonstrated a
    Wi-Fi signal with a 3-kilometer range.

    (SoC) design that uses a wireless protocol called [Wi-Fi HaLow](https://www.wi-fi.org/discover-wi-fi/wi-fi-certified-halow),
    based on the [IEEE 802.11ah standard](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7920364).
    The protocol significantly boosts range by using lower-frequency radio signals
    that propagate further than conventional Wi-Fi frequencies. It is also low power,
    and is geared toward providing connectivity for [Internet of Things](https://spectrum.ieee.org/iot-for-arson-forensics)
    (IoT) applications.**'

    network could communicate at distances of up to 3 km while maintaining speeds
    around 1 megabit per second—enough to support a slightly grainy video call.**'

    Guda, apart from the fact that it operates in the 900-megahertz frequency band

    further and are better at penetrating solid objects, which is the secret to HaLow’s
    much longer ranges.**'

    can still support data-intensive applications like video. The technology is also
    much lower power than conventional Wi-Fi, as it has in-built features that allow
    devices to remain dormant for long periods and wake only when they need to transmit
    data. This makes it feasible to power HaLow devices using batteries. Guda says
    Morse Micro is working with partners building battery-powered IoT devices that
    will need to operate for years, and in those cases, HaLow won’t run the battery
    down too soon.**'
