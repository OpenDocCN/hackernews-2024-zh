- en: Match Group, the international conglomerate that owns Tinder, Hinge, OkCupid,
    and almost every other popular dating app, just inked a major partnership with
    OpenAI. The company shared only a few hazy details, saying AI will help employees
    with “work-related tasks.” The dating giant says it long term plan is to squeeze
    artificial intelligence into “literally everything” in its apps. Incorporating
    ChatGPT into its worker’s daily responsibilities is the first major step towards
    making online dating an AI-focused enterprise.

- en: The company celebrated its new partnership with a [press release](https://mtch.com/single-news/905)
    written by ChatGPT and edited by Match Group’s Corporate Communications team (meaning
    it was written by MatchGroup’s communications team). It includes quotes supposedly
    penned by the AI itself, as though it has its own feelings about corporate strategy.
    “I’m thrilled that Match Group matched with me,” ChatGPT said. “Together, we’re
    not just breaking the ice; we’re melting it, and reshaping the way work gets done.”

    less clear. However, Match Group has been explicit that it thinks it will be good
    for its business and the world if just about every part of its users’ interactions
    is shaped and filtered through the algorithmic lens of artificial intelligence.

    Match Group CEO Bernard Kim said on a January earnings call. “I envision AI to
    be felt through the entire experience, influencing everything from profile creation
    to matching to connecting for dates. Literally everything.”

    has used AI to power trust and safety efforts, enhance matching algorithms, and
    a variety of other purposes for most of its recent history.

- en: But adding AI to “literally everything” is a major shift to a company that has
    astronomical power over our romantic lives. And so far, that shift includes a
    surprisingly tolerant policy towards people plugging AI into their dating profiles
    and letting it run amok on other users. In early February, Gizmodo reported that
    a man [used ChatGPT to talk to 5,000 women on Tinder](https://gizmodo.com/guy-used-chatgpt-talk-5-000-women-tinder-met-his-wife-1851228179).

  zh: 但是，将AI添加到“几乎所有事情”中是公司对我们的浪漫生活具有天文级权力的重大转变。到目前为止，这种转变包括对人们将AI插入其约会档案并让其在其他用户中肆意妄为的惊人宽容政策。早在二月初，Gizmodo报道称，一名男子[使用ChatGPT在Tinder上与5000名女性交谈](https://gizmodo.com/guy-used-chatgpt-talk-5-000-women-tinder-met-his-wife-1851228179)。
- en: 'This, apparently, does not violate Match Group’s policies, including its number
    one [AI principle](https://mtch.com/ai-principles): promoting authenticity. At
    the time, a company spokesperson told Gizmodo that “Tinder and Match Group believe
    AI is a great tool that we believe will make dating better.”'

  zh: 显然，这并不违反Match Group的政策，包括其第一条[AI原则](https://mtch.com/ai-principles)：促进真实性。当时，公司发言人告诉Gizmodo说，“Tinder和Match
    Group认为AI是一个很棒的工具，我们相信它将使约会变得更好。”
- en: In fact, Match Group wants to explore building its own AI tools that could perform
    tasks like writing your conversation starters or suggesting date ideas. That means
    the next time you’re chatting with someone on a dating app, you might want to
    ask yourself whether you’re just flirting with a robot.

  zh: 实际上，Match Group希望探索建立自己的AI工具，可以执行诸如编写您的对话开场白或建议约会想法等任务。这意味着下次你在约会应用上与某人聊天时，你可能要问问自己，你是否只是在和一个机器人调情。
