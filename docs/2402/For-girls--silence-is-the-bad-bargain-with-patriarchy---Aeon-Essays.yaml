    about women’s silences. I had spent the 1980s talking and listening to hundreds
    of girls between the ages of seven and 18 in a range of schools and after-school
    programmes in the United States. I remember the turning point at adolescence,
    when, in coming of age, girls came to call an honest voice ‘stupid’ or ‘rude’,
    ‘selfish’, ‘mean’, or ‘crazy’. ‘Unpleasant’ and ‘insufferable’ were adjectives
    used by Anne Frank.

    no one would want to be with me, my voice would be too loud,’ and then adding,

    As if it were impossible to listen to girls and go on living in the way that we
    have been. As if somehow girls would blow the cover. I was taken aback by the
    incentives held out to girls not to say what otherwise they would say, and by
    the force brought to bear in making sure that, once a girl has come of age, her
    voice – a voice readily heard among young girls, a voice artists have heard and
    recorded across time and cultures – will be covered or, if outspoken, will be
    heard as ‘too loud’ or too much or somehow not right, and will not be listened

    relationships. The US Surgeon General speaks about the pervasiveness of loneliness
    and how connections are essential if we are to survive and thrive. Yet the silencing
    of the girls alerts us to a deeper problem. From girls I learned about a crisis
    of connection, a turning point when relationships are on the line. Where, if you
    say what you are feeling and thinking, no one will want to be with you, and if
    you don’t say what you are feeling and thinking, no one will be with you. Either
    way, you will be all alone. And it wasn’t just girls, although it was listening
    to girls that proved both revelatory and revolutionary in the sense of naming
    a problem – a crisis of connection – that has turned out to be both pervasive
    and urgent.

    what I had said to Iris in the 1980s. When Liza at 16 tells me that she is ‘holding

    ask the obvious question?’ which is obvious to her as well. She speaks about ‘care
    and protection’, and from other girls I hear about not hurting people’s feelings
    or keeping the peace or not making trouble or not provoking exclusion and retaliation
    – reasons girls give for silencing an honest voice and for concluding, as Liza

    *Descartes’ Error* (1994), Damasio reports the findings of his research in neurobiology.
    The Cartesian split between reason and emotion, long considered the *sine qua
    non* of rationality, turns out instead to be a manifestation of brain injury or
    trauma. It leaves the capacity for logical deduction intact, our ability to solve
    logical puzzles, but impedes our ability to reason inductively, to learn from
    experience and thus navigate the human social world. In her [book](https://www.hachettebookgroup.com/titles/judith-lewis-herman-md/trauma-and-recovery/9781541602953/?lens=basic-books)
    *Trauma and Recovery* (1992), the psychiatrist Judith Herman makes a similar point.
    The separation of the self from relationships, once seen as a move from dependence
    to independence and celebrated as a hallmark of maturity, is in fact a residue
    of trauma, the response of the self to the experience of having been overwhelmed.

    an outsize effect. I’m thinking of Greta Thunberg, at 15, with her handmade sign,
    standing alone in front of the Swedish parliament. Her one-person school strike
    sparked the largest climate demonstration up to that time in history, with millions
    across the world coming out to protest the failure of politicians to take the
    climate crisis seriously. When she visited the US Capitol and members of Congress
    flocked to thank her, Greta told them, in effect, don’t thank me, do something.
    As she said to the World Economic Forum in Davos: ‘I want you to feel the fear
    I feel every day. And then I want you to act.’ To those who said she should be
    in school, she said, ‘since you grown-ups don’t give a damn about my future, I
    won’t either.’'

    the murder of George Floyd by the policeman Derek Chauvin, she was the only one
    who took out her cellphone, clicked on the camera and recorded the entire incident.
    Her recording provided the evidence that led to Chauvin’s conviction. Had she
    not recorded what she saw, she said, no one would have believed her. And yet,
    as she said: ‘he was suffering’ and ‘it was not right.’ In one sense, what was
    happening was obvious, and yet Darnella was the only one who did something about
    it.'

- en: I have called my new [book](https://www.politybooks.com/search?s=in%20a%20human%20voice)
    *In a Human Voice* (2023) because what once was confused has now become obvious.
    The ‘different voice’ (the voice of care ethics), although initially heard as
    ‘feminine’ and associated with women, is in fact a human voice. The voice it differs
    from is a patriarchal voice, bound to gender binaries and hierarchies. And where
    patriarchy is in force and enforced, the human voice is a voice of resistance.

  zh: 我之所以称我的新书为[*以人的声音*](https://www.politybooks.com/search?s=in%20a%20human%20voice)（2023年），是因为曾经令人困惑的东西现在变得显而易见。‘不同的声音’（关怀伦理的声音），虽然最初被视为‘女性化’并与女性联系在一起，实际上是人类的声音。它与之不同的声音是一种父权声音，固守着性别二元和等级制度。在父权制度强制实施的地方，人类的声音是一种抗议的声音。
- en: 'From girls I learned how to listen for a human voice that has gone under cover
    and to hear the difference between a cover voice (culturally sanctioned) and an
    under voice (grounded in experience). From girls I learned to pay attention to
    the words ‘really’ and ‘actually’ and the phrase ‘to be honest’, and to recognise
    how they can signal a shift from a cover voice, the voice that says what I think
    and feel, to an under voice: the voice that says what I really think, or how I
    actually feel, or what I would say if I were to be quite honest. Girls taught
    me that the under voice is more accessible than I had imagined, but also that,
    to hear the under voice, I might have to question the cover voice. In a study
    with couples, I found this to be true also with men. My ability to hear a human
    voice could depend on my questioning a cover voice that had sounded more manly.
    What I learned from listening to girls proved to be much more far-reaching than
    I had imagined, because, when I started out, the silencing of the girls had been
    dismissed as either a necessary correction or inconsequential.'

- en: At the end of the fall semester last year, a student sent me an email. A former
    litigator in her late 20s, she had returned to school to get her master’s in law
    and had enrolled in my seminar on listening. She was writing to thank me. ‘It
    has been really eye-opening to practise listening to myself, and to what I already
    know. I find too often, in various parts of my life, I have not trusted my own
    intuition, or stopped short of coming to conclusions that I have the evidence
    for, and haven’t known why.’ She wanted to thank me especially for disbelieving
    her when, in presenting her work to the class that day, she had said she did not
    know why the word ‘dissociative’ was used twice by the person she had interviewed.
    Listening to her presentation, it was clear to me that in fact she knew what ‘dissociative’
    was doing on the landscape of this interview. As she had pointed out, the phrase
    ‘I don’t know’ was ‘everywhere’. When she said she didn’t know, I had voiced my
    disbelief. In effect, I had trusted her where she hadn’t trusted herself. ‘Giving
    me and our class the permission to listen to and impart this trust in ourselves
    – it means so much to me, more than you may have been aware of.’

    than 10,000 teenage girls in the US, when asked if they don’t say what they really
    think nor disagree (when in fact they do disagree) because they want people to
    like them, 46 per cent of teenage girls say they do this, a figure that goes up
    to 62 per cent among girls with a grade point average of 4.0 or above. I suspect
    this may be because, having more opportunity, they have more to lose.

- en: People attribute the current high levels of psychological distress among girls
    to the effects of social media – and it’s true, it heightens the costs of speaking.
    Two girls, interviewed last spring, when asked if there was one thing they could
    change about the world, mentioned people’s judgments. The readiness to judge falls
    heavily on girls, often in the face of little evidence, once they reach adolescence,
    and social media only magnifies the effects of negative judgments. But it is also
    my suspicion that, as more opportunities become open to girls and women, there
    is also more pressure on them not to say what they really think and feel, so as
    not to jeopardise their connections and thus diminish their chances for advancement.
