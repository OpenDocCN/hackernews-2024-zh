    about women’s silences. I had spent the 1980s talking and listening to hundreds
    of girls between the ages of seven and 18 in a range of schools and after-school
    programmes in the United States. I remember the turning point at adolescence,
    when, in coming of age, girls came to call an honest voice ‘stupid’ or ‘rude’,
    ‘selfish’, ‘mean’, or ‘crazy’. ‘Unpleasant’ and ‘insufferable’ were adjectives
    used by Anne Frank.

    Neeti at 16 saying: ‘The voice that stands up for what I believe in has been buried
    deep inside me.’ Iris at 17 saying: ‘If I were to say what I was feeling and thinking,
    no one would want to be with me, my voice would be too loud,’ and then adding,
    by way of explanation, ‘but you have to have relationships.’ And I remember saying
    to Iris: ‘But if you are not saying what you are feeling and thinking, then where
    are *you* in these “relationships”?’'

    As if it were impossible to listen to girls and go on living in the way that we
    have been. As if somehow girls would blow the cover. I was taken aback by the
    incentives held out to girls not to say what otherwise they would say, and by
    the force brought to bear in making sure that, once a girl has come of age, her
    voice – a voice readily heard among young girls, a voice artists have heard and
    recorded across time and cultures – will be covered or, if outspoken, will be
    heard as ‘too loud’ or too much or somehow not right, and will not be listened
    to or taken seriously.

    relationships. The US Surgeon General speaks about the pervasiveness of loneliness
    and how connections are essential if we are to survive and thrive. Yet the silencing
    of the girls alerts us to a deeper problem. From girls I learned about a crisis
    of connection, a turning point when relationships are on the line. Where, if you
    say what you are feeling and thinking, no one will want to be with you, and if
    you don’t say what you are feeling and thinking, no one will be with you. Either
    way, you will be all alone. And it wasn’t just girls, although it was listening
    to girls that proved both revelatory and revolutionary in the sense of naming
    a problem – a crisis of connection – that has turned out to be both pervasive
    and urgent.

    ask the obvious question?’ which is obvious to her as well. She speaks about ‘care
    and protection’, and from other girls I hear about not hurting people’s feelings
    or keeping the peace or not making trouble or not provoking exclusion and retaliation
    – reasons girls give for silencing an honest voice and for concluding, as Liza
    does, that the fight for relationship is ‘a battle not worth fighting’.'

    Judy observes that, in the course of growing up, children are in danger of forgetting

    Damasio](https://aeon.co/essays/the-interoceptive-turn-is-maturing-as-a-rich-science-of-selfhood)
    describes in his book *The Feeling of What Happens* (1999)*.* In their bodies
    and in their emotions, they register their experience from moment to moment, picking
    up the music or the feeling of what happens, which then plays in their minds and
    thoughts. Thus they name what one can think of as relational crimes and misdemeanours
    – stealing someone’s attention, acting like one is the owner of others – and they
    are confident in their ability or power to do something about it. In *Meeting
    at the Crossroads* (1992), Lyn Mikel Brown and I report the findings of our five-year
    study involving close to 100 girls between the ages of seven and 18; we call these
    young girls ‘whistleblowers’ in the relational world. And you know what happens

    of this for resisting injustice, she introduces a startling image: ‘When we teach
    people not to use their voices openly and authentically, we sew a veil of doubt
    over everything they know, which stifles their willingness to speak and confront
    conflict.’ To another woman in the class, this was ‘the trauma of my childhood

    *Descartes’ Error* (1994), Damasio reports the findings of his research in neurobiology.
    The Cartesian split between reason and emotion, long considered the *sine qua
    non* of rationality, turns out instead to be a manifestation of brain injury or
    trauma. It leaves the capacity for logical deduction intact, our ability to solve
    logical puzzles, but impedes our ability to reason inductively, to learn from
    experience and thus navigate the human social world. In her [book](https://www.hachettebookgroup.com/titles/judith-lewis-herman-md/trauma-and-recovery/9781541602953/?lens=basic-books)
    *Trauma and Recovery* (1992), the psychiatrist Judith Herman makes a similar point.
    The separation of the self from relationships, once seen as a move from dependence
    to independence and celebrated as a hallmark of maturity, is in fact a residue
    of trauma, the response of the self to the experience of having been overwhelmed.

    actually feel, or what I would say if I were to be quite honest. Girls taught

    to hear the under voice, I might have to question the cover voice. In a study

    voice could depend on my questioning a cover voice that had sounded more manly.
