# Usborne 1980s Computer Books

Usborne has been publishing award-winning computer books since the 1980s, and we're happy to offer free pdfs of these books to download.

Many of today's tech professionals were inspired by the Usborne computing books they read as children. The books included program listings for such iconic computers as the ZX Spectrum, the BBC Micro and the Commodore 64, and are still used in some computer clubs today.

### Links now available

We're sorry the pdfs were temporarily unavailable. The links have been updated and all the books should now be available. (25 November 2021)

## Computer and coding books today

Our latest books on coding using Scratch and Python will give today's kids a clear understanding of computers and coding.

Their format of colourful cartoons and easy to digest layout have made them something of a cult object among the now-grown-up generation who first received them.
