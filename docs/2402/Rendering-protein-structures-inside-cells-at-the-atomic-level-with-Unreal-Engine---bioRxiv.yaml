- en: While the recent development of cryogenic electron tomography (CryoET) makes
    it possible to identify various macromolecules inside cells and determine their
    structure at near-atomic resolution, it remains challenging to visualize the complex
    cellular environment at the atomic level. One of the main hurdles in cell visualization
    is to render the millions of molecules in real time computationally. Here, using
    a video game engine, we demonstrate the capability of rendering massive biological
    macromolecules at the atomic level within their native environment. To facilitate
    the visualization, we also provide tools that help the interactive navigation
    inside the cells, as well as software that converts protein structures identified
    using CryoET to a scene that can be explored with the game engine.
