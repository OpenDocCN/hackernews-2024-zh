- en: 'Paul uncovered his eyes, and looked around the room. Away from a few dazzling
    patches of direct sunshine, everything glowed softly in the diffuse light: the
    matte white brick walls, the imitation (imitation) mahogany furniture; even the
    posters – Bosch, Dali, Ernst, and Giger – looked harmless, domesticated. Wherever
    he turned his gaze (if nowhere else), the simulation was utterly convincing; the
    spotlight of his attention made it so. Hypothetical light rays were being traced
    backwards from individual rod and cone cells on his simulated retinas, and projected
    out into the virtual environment to determine exactly what needed to be computed:
    a lot of detail near the centre of his vision, much less towards the periphery.
    Objects out of sight didn’t “vanish” entirely, if they influenced the ambient
    light, but Paul knew that the calculations would rarely be pursued beyond the
    crudest first-order approximations: Bosch’s *Garden of Earthly Delights* reduced
    to an average reflectance value, a single grey rectangle – because once his back
    was turned, any more detail would have been wasted. Everything in the room was
    as finely resolved, at any given moment, as it needed to be to fool him – no more,
    no less.'

    brain and body which can be run in virtual reality, albeit seventeen times more
    slowly than real time. He wants them to be his guinea pigs for a set of experiments
    about the nature of artificial intelligence, time, and causality, but they keep
    changing their mind and baling out on him, shutting themselves down.'

- en: Maria Deluca is an Autoverse addict; she’s unemployed and running out of money,
    but she can’t stop wasting her time playing around with the cellular automaton
    known as the Autoverse, a virtual world that follows a simple set of mathematical
    rules as its “laws of physics”.

- en: 'Paul makes Maria a very strange offer: he asks her to design a seed for an
    entire virtual biosphere able to exist inside the Autoverse, modelled right down
    to the molecular level. The job will pay well, and will allow her to indulge her
    obsession. There has to be a catch, though, because such a seed would be useless
    without a simulation of the Autoverse large enough to allow the resulting biosphere
    to grow and flourish — a feat far beyond the capacity of all the computers in
    the world.'
