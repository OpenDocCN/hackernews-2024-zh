    society really knowing it, which is to say there's no public source where you
    can take advantage of it. And the cops, if they have that information, they're
    certainly not sharing. In fact, one of the things Furtado says in starting the
    Wiki crime map was, "This information may or may not exist some place in society,

- en: 'It''s also become my motto, when people ask me what we''re doing -- and when
    I say "we" I mean the larger society trying to figure out how to deploy this cognitive
    surplus, but I also mean we, especially, the people in this room, the people who
    are working hammer and tongs at figuring out the next good idea. From now on,
    that''s what I''m going to tell them: We''re looking for the mouse. We''re going
    to look at every place that a reader or a listener or a viewer or a user has been
    locked out, has been served up passive or a fixed or a canned experience, and
    ask ourselves, ***"If we carve out a little bit of the cognitive surplus and deploy
    it here, could we make a good thing happen?***" And I''m betting the answer is
    yes.'

  zh: 它也成为了我的座右铭，当人们问我我们在做什么时 — 当我说“我们”时，我指的是试图找出如何利用这种认知剩余的更大社会，但我也指的是我们，尤其是这个房间里的人们，那些正竭力寻找下一个好点子的人们。从现在开始，这就是我要告诉他们的：我们在找老鼠。我们要查看每个读者、听众、观众或用户被拒之门外的地方，被提供被动、固定或罐头经验的地方，并问自己，“如果我们在这里投入一点认知剩余，我们能让一件好事发生吗？”而我敢打赌答案是肯定的。
