    launch vehicles](https://www.twz.com/starships-33-engines-created-the-mother-of-all-shock-diamonds)
    for sensitive, high-risk missions, the company has said. At present, the U.S.
    government relies on non-military contractors to launch payloads for various operations,
    including [satellite launches](https://spacenews.com/spacex-launches-13-satellites-for-u-s-space-development-agency/),
    and does not have its own space launch vehicles — at least any that are disclosed
    — which it could deploy in a potential contingency scenario. SpaceX is [already
    working](https://www.twz.com/40865/rocket-delivery-of-cargo-anywhere-in-an-hour-in-new-air-force-budget-proposal)
    with the Air Force and Space Force on the ['Rocket Cargo' program](https://afresearchlab.com/technology/successstories/rocket-cargo-for-agile-global-logistics/),
    which seeks to rapidly deliver cargo, and possible personnel, anywhere on Earth
    that can support a landing.

    comprises a superheavyrocket booster and spacecraft. Starship — which will be

    ever flown, [according to the company](https://www.spacex.com/vehicles/starship/),
    and is reportedly capable of carrying up to 150 metric tons while being fully
    reusable. Eventually, SpaceX intends for its Starship system to carry crew and
    cargo to Earth orbit, the Moon, and Mars, but it is still in relatively early
    flight test development.

    SpaceX and government officials are in the process of figuring out; all of which
    remains hypothetical at this point, given that Starship is still in development.

    (AFSOC) special forces as possible users of the Rocket Cargo program. It was specified
    that plans for the program involved transporting payloads of up to 100 tons, including
    cargo and potentially personnel, via orbital or suborbital profiles to forward
