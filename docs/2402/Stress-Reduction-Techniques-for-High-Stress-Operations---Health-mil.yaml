- en: Any role in the military can be stressful. However, for those like special operators,
    explosive ordinance technicians, submariners, aviators and others, stress is a
    significant part of the job. The extreme stress faced by these warriors, and others,
    can lead to psychological health concerns. Recent research focusing on special
    operations forces (SOF) highlights the risks faced by service members working
    in any high-stress role. Heavy physical, mental and emotional strain can lead
    to psychological health concerns. These can include depression, anxiety or posttraumatic
    stress disorder. It is important for all warriors to learn stress-management techniques.
    Stress can cause anxiety, depression, trouble sleeping, irritability, heavy drinking
    or other concerns. If you experience any of these symptoms, or have other concerns,
    talk to a health care provider now. Your provider can address your concerns and
    help you develop a stress-management plan. Getting care early helps you stay mission
    ready. It also avoids new or worsening symptoms.

    The nature of their work is sensitive, and they make frequent deployments, often
    on short notice. They have strong resilience skills because of SOF selection screenings
    and their follow-on training. However, they aren't immune to the effects of high-stress
    operations. In one survey about twice as many members of SOF units reported symptoms
    associated with PTSD when compared to members of conventional units. Others, like
    drone pilots, face similar stressors. Executing critical missions, dealing with
    life-and-death decisions and safeguarding classified information all adds up.
    That makes robust skills for managing stress crucial if you're in these types
    of roles.
