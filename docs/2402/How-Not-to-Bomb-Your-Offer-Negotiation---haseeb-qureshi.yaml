    alternatives, you allow your interlocutor to develop a mental model of when and

    joining a startup and gallivanting through North Africa).
  id: totrans-split-62

  id: totrans-split-63

    as much of it as possible outside of salary. A signing bonus, for example, is
    easier to give than salary. A signing bonus has the advantage of only needing
    to be paid once, it gets the candidate excited about joining (because everyone
    likes wads of cash), and it’s generally not as public.

    previous frozen price, or risk losing it), with no way to actually sell it yet.
    The only way to truly liquidate your options is when the company IPOs or is acquired.

    you probably don’t have one yet. But once you get into intermediary stages, you
    should set for yourself a deadline on which you’ll sign. It can be for an arbitrary
    reason (or no reason at all), but just pre-committing to a deadline will allow
    you to negotiate more clearly and powerfully.

    Your narrative should basically be “I want to see the strongest offer your company
    can muster. Then I will go into my cave, meditate for 10 days, and when I emerge
    I will have decided in my heart which company to join.” This gives you enormous
    power to avoid any on-the-spot decision points or premature promises.

    offers spontaneously improved as deadlines approached, or a fallen player gets
    up and presents you the holy grail in the 11th hour. Either way, there’s no harm.

    is really important to me right now. If you can improve the salary by 10K a year,
