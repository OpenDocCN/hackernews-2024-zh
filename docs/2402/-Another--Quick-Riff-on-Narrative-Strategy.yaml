    The last time I wrote about it was [in 2020](https://tomcritchlow.com/2020/02/20/narrative-strategy/).

- en: I‚Äôm convinced that narrative strategy is the frame through which I do all my
    consulting work. For my internal logic it is how I think about every client project
    - it‚Äôs the overarching umbrella for my work. But externally? I‚Äôm not sure clients
    understand it that way. I think the phrase ‚Äúnarrative strategy‚Äù places too much
    emphasis on the *narrative* part and not enough on the *strategy* part.

    We propose that the use of narratives in a strategy goes well beyond the phenomenon
    of corporate storytelling. As contextual factors, narratives serve different goals

    strategic use of narratives plays a particular role in organizational change situations.
