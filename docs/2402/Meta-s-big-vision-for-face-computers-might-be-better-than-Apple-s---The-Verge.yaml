    That’s the conclusion both Apple and Meta have arrived at. You can see it in the
    [Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses](/23922425/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-review) and
    the [Apple Vision Pro](/24054862/apple-vision-pro-review-vr-ar-headset-features-price).
    Both fall short of what we imagine true augmented reality ought to be, but that’s
    not their ultimate purpose. They’re designed to prime the public for the future
    by giving them a taste of it now.

    with it, but [what time I did spend](/24040075/apple-vision-pro-hands-on-virtual-reality)
    cemented that it is the most technologically impressive mixed reality headset
    I’ve ever tried. If we’re talking [pure hardware innovation](https://www.ifixit.com/News/90137/vision-pro-teardown-why-those-fake-eyes-look-so-weird),
    the Vision Pro blasts Meta’s smart glasses into the stratosphere. But where Apple
    threw its formidable resources into building the *best possible* headset with
    current technology, Meta decided to build cheaper gadgets that people want to
    use *now*.

    revenue](https://www.roadtovr.com/reality-labs-revenue-q4-2023/) last quarter.
    We didn’t get a breakdown for the Ray-Ban Meta glasses, but demand and engagement
    were strong enough [that they’re making more](https://mixed-news.com/en/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-sales-retention/).Case
    in point, my wearable skeptic spouse is obsessed with them. They have their own
    pair now. This nerd went and got a prescription for them, along with transition
    lenses so they can wear them everywhere. They make a lot of car content like POV
    driving videos and in their words, these glasses aren’t perfect but they are a
    game-changer because they’ll never have to strap a GoPro to their head again.
    Otherwise, it’s [a normal pair of stylish Ray-Bans](/2023/9/30/23894067/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-style-wearables).

    cognitive whiplash watching my spouse, who has long thought smart glasses are
    a dumb idea, latch onto these so quickly.

    to the masses. Apple building a headset signals to the tech unsavvy that it can
    be done. Selling it to consumers says it’s already happening. Never mind that
    these kinds of headsets have been around for a decade. *Apple* is doing it now,
    and it’s going to be the *best*.

    ignore the ludicrous cost of entry. Wow enough people with potential, prowess,
    and prestige, and they’ll buy into it long enough for you to fix what doesn’t
    work. There’s a few wearable precedents. People thought wearing AirPods was silly
    at first. I remember people warning they’d get snatched out of ears on the subway.
    Now everyone on the train wears them. When it launched, the Apple Watch was an
    overpriced gadget that didn’t know what it was supposed to be. It didn’t find
    its footing until the Series 3\. Now, it’s the most popular smartwatch in the
    world. Theoretically, the Vision Pro could do the same thing. But despite strong
    preorders, [demand is expected to taper off](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/01/22/demand-for-apple-vision-pro-headset-could-wane-top-analyst-warns.html).

    be. The glasses easily slot into the life you currently lead. Sure, the AI assistant
    beta was wonky when I tried it, but that’s more a limitation of AI assistants
    [needing hyper-specific prompts](/2023/5/14/23719048/google-ai-duet-sidekick-search-prompts-io).
    Being able to have AI [tell you what’s in a picture](/2023/12/12/23998780/ray-ban-smart-glasses-hey-meta-multimodal-ai-features)
    you took with your glasses is useful. It’s more audio than visual AR, but it’s
    a step toward normalizing using a face computer to interact with real objects
    in real space. Especially versus the Vision Pro, which currently leans more into
    virtual and mixed reality. It’s cool to pull up your Mac’s screen and work on
    the Moon, but that’s not really AR.

    Meta’s current answer to the Vision Pro. It’s not as flashy as the Vision Pro,
    but right now you can do a lot more with it. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg was eager
    to point that out in [his impromptu review of Apple’s headset](/2024/2/13/24072413/mark-zuckerberg-apple-vision-pro-review-quest-3).
    Meta’s strategy is focusing on what you can do now, and doing that gives people
    a reason to stick around. If they stick around, they’ve inherently bought into
    your idea of the future.

    a common complaint I’ve seen from Vision Pro buyers is they don’t know what to
    do with it besides watch movies. It’s also too early to say whether Meta glasses
    users will stick around long term. ([They certainly didn’t for the Ray-Ban Stories](/2023/8/3/23818462/meta-ray-ban-stories-smart-glasses-retention-reality-labs).)
    But we do know one thing: at the end of his Vision Pro review, Zuckerberg said
    the Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses sales have far exceeded his hopes.'
