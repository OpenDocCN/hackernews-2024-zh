    on Tuesday, Khan said that when the $40 billion merger was called off due to "[significant
    regulatory challenges](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/02/08/softbank-plans-to-take-arm-public-after-nvidia-takeover-deal-collapses.html)"
    in 2022, it forced both companies to innovate and create new products.

    said would have been "the largest semiconductor chip merger in history," as an
    example of a successful antitrust action that doesn't hamper companies from pursuing
    financial success or embracing new technologies such as artificial intelligence.

    how organic growth and competition can spur firms to further innovate in ways
    that benefit the business and public alike," Khan said at the conference.'

    cash and stock. Both firms hailed the deal as a way to create the premier computing
    company for the "[age of AI.](https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-to-acquire-arm-for-40-billion-creating-worlds-premier-computing-company-for-the-age-of-ai)"

    and Asia. Arm's core technology, its instruction set architecture, is used by
    companies such as Apple, Google and Qualcomm to build processors. Arm is often
    described as a "neutral supplier" that doesn't compete with its customers.

    architecture, giving it the power to foreclose access to a key input needed to
    make their chips. Nvidia said it would invest in Arm and allow other companies
    continued use of Arm's chip designs, preserving the company's licensing model.

    the deal collapsed less than three months later.

    over the computing technology and designs that rival firms rely on to develop
    their own competing chips would be bad for competition and hamstring innovation

    established a leading position in AI chips. Nvidia's value has nearly tripled
    mostly on the strength of sales of [its AI chips for servers](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/02/23/nvidias-a100-is-the-10000-chip-powering-the-race-for-ai-.html)
