    demonstrated unprecedented speed running open-source LLMs such as Llama-2 (70
    billion parameters) at more than 100 tokens per second, and Mixtral at nearly
    500 tokens per second per user on a Groq’s Language Processing Unit (LPU).

    Lee Sedol and won? Well, about a month before the competition, there was a test
    game which AlphaGo lost. The researchers from DeepMind ported AlphaGo to Tensor
    Processing Unit (TPU) and then the computer program was able to win by a wide
    margin.

    very quickly.** Unlike other computer chips that do many things at once (parallel
    processing), the LPU works on tasks one after the other (sequential processing),
    which is perfect for understanding and generating language. Imagine it like a
    relay race where each runner (chip) passes the baton (data) to the next, making
    everything run super fast. The LPU is designed to overcome the two LLM bottlenecks:
    compute density and memory bandwidth.'

    compiler development** before even thinking about the hardware. They made sure
    the software could guide how the chips talk to each other, ensuring they work
    together seamlessly like a team in a factory. This makes the LPU really good at
    processing language efficiently and at high speed, ideal for AI tasks that involve
    understanding or creating text.

    it comes to inference, making light work of applying trained models to new data,
    GPUs still reign supreme in the training arena. The LPU and GPU might become the
