    available to read for free. But after the four cofounders [discovered](https://www.404media.co/why-404-media-needs-your-email-address/)
    — through their own reporting — that their stories were being scraped, paraphrased
    by AI text “spinners,” and published on other websites, they decided to start
    requiring readers to provide their email addresses to access stories, and they
    explained why.

    digesting our stories and gaming the system to get more views than our original
    reporting they’re ripping off,” cofounder [Emanuel Maiberg](https://twitter.com/emanuelmaiberg)
    told me an email. “It’s important to us, and we think it’s important to our readers
    to know why we’re doing what we’re doing, but it’s also in the public interest
    to know what Google, AI, content mills, etc. are doing to the general health of
    the information environment.”

    said. It [launched](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/22/business/media/404-media-vice-motherboard.html)
    last August as a news outlet covering the impacts of technology on users in ways
    that are accessible, transparent, and relatable.

    happy and excited about, and what they’re really upset about,” Koebler said. “We
    want the communities that we’re writing about to read these articles and be like,
    ‘Okay, they got it right.’ But we don’t want to be so insular that only those
    people are interested.”

    consultants, software, offices,” Koebler said. Vice, in his view, “wasn’t able
    to consistently invest in new hires and in the journalism in a way that felt sustainable.
    We wanted to start a new company and basically strip it to its essentials.”

    to cover initial costs. Koebler declined to share current revenue numbers, but
    said the company is profitable (and that everyone’s been able to pay themselves
    back the money they initially put in).

    beholden to no one but our readers and colleagues — as opposed to say, investors,
    venture capitalists, or out-of-touch executives — feels like the future.”

    podcast ads, donations, [merchandise](https://404media.myshopify.com/), and [paid
    subscriptions](https://www.404media.co/faq/). Paid subscriptions, which start
    at [$100 per year](https://www.404media.co/), include access to events like [FOIA
    forums](https://www.404media.co/404-medias-first-foia-forum/), where the staff
    teaches participants how to file records requests. (More than 40 people attended
    the first forum.) 404 Media is also in the early stages of turning some of its
    feature stories into podcasts and documentaries. Koebler said that direct ad sponsorships
    — something he worked on for Motherboard — are working, too.

    hopefully that will work.’ And what we’re finding is that, yes, that is working,
    but then there’s also all these other little ways that you can make small amounts
    of money, like selling merch,” Koebler said. “We’re on Apple News now and in the
    process of enabling monetization there…I suspect that when we turn it on, we’ll
    be making $20 to $100 per month, which is very little money but as we grow, all
    of those things start to add up.”

    set up litigation insurance, for example, but everyone makes their own art for
    stories instead of paying for agency photos. (The reporters are also the merch
    models). Everyone works from home, so they don’t have an office and don’t plan
    on getting one anytime soon. The team communicates through a free Slack channel.
    Koebler mails out merchandise from his garage in Los Angeles. Every month, the
    team meets (virtually) to decide how much they can pay themselves. (The number
    changes each month, but everyone gets paid the same amount.)

    imperative that we be on TikTok and Instagram in a way that’s feels native there,”
    Koebler said. “We sort of launched [on every platform] and then we scaled back
    slightly in terms of what we’re focusing on. We will always focus on the reporting
    and the stories. Getting it out to other places is a priority of ours, but if
    there’s not enough time in the day, we’re not going to work 20-hour days just
    so we can have, like, a good TikTok.”

    could come to the newsroom and see the newspaper getting printed,” Cole said.

    grow. Right now, almost every story is free to read when it’s first published,
    but 404 Media is starting to put older stories behind the paywall. (FOIA reporting
    is an exception and “will always be free because it’s based on public documents
    that everyone has a right to access,” Maiberg said. Those stories often include
    an ask at the top for readers to subscribe or donate.)

    don’t get many eyeballs at all, but a much higher percentage of people who read
    those articles convert [to subscribers],” Maiberg said.'

    engages and pays for our work, it feels very good and productive.”
