    available to read for free. But after the four cofounders [discovered](https://www.404media.co/why-404-media-needs-your-email-address/)

    by AI text “spinners,” and published on other websites, they decided to start

    hopefully that will work.’ And what we’re finding is that, yes, that is working,

    of money, like selling merch,” Koebler said. “We’re on Apple News now and in the
    process of enabling monetization there…I suspect that when we turn it on, we’ll
    be making $20 to $100 per month, which is very little money but as we grow, all

- en: The 404 team DIYs as much as possible. They pay for hosting through Ghost and
    set up litigation insurance, for example, but everyone makes their own art for
    stories instead of paying for agency photos. (The reporters are also the merch
    models). Everyone works from home, so they don’t have an office and don’t plan
    on getting one anytime soon. The team communicates through a free Slack channel.
    Koebler mails out merchandise from his garage in Los Angeles. Every month, the
    team meets (virtually) to decide how much they can pay themselves. (The number
    changes each month, but everyone gets paid the same amount.)

  zh: 404 团队尽可能自己动手。例如，他们通过 Ghost 支付托管费用并设置诉讼保险，但每个人都自己制作故事的艺术品，而不是支付代理机构的照片费用。（记者们也是周边产品的模特）。每个人都在家工作，所以他们没有办公室，也没有计划很快设立一个。团队通过免费的
    Slack 渠道进行沟通。Koebler 在洛杉矶的车库里寄出周边产品。团队每个月（虚拟地）会议决定他们可以支付自己多少钱。（每月的数字都会变化，但每个人都得到相同的支付金额。）
- en: The focus is now on growing the audience in ways that feel authentic. “It’s
    imperative that we be on TikTok and Instagram in a way that’s feels native there,”
    Koebler said. “We sort of launched [on every platform] and then we scaled back
    slightly in terms of what we’re focusing on. We will always focus on the reporting
    and the stories. Getting it out to other places is a priority of ours, but if
    there’s not enough time in the day, we’re not going to work 20-hour days just
    so we can have, like, a good TikTok.”

    20 小时，只是为了拥有一个好的 TikTok。”

    my neighbors, people I saw at the farmer’s market or the coffee shop, and they
    could come to the newsroom and see the newspaper getting printed,” Cole said.
