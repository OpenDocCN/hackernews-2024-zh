- en: Every week the YC Group Partners meet and discuss the current batch. One common
    area of discussion is ideas — what kind of ideas are these founders having the
    best luck with? Which ones are they pivoting away from?

- en: These discussions also do a good job of helping us notice the gaps. Ideas that
    should be made real — and that we’d want to fund! — but that we aren’t seeing
    many people work on or apply with. In a recent discussion like this, we realized
    it was time to put together an entirely new [Request for Startups](https://www.ycombinator.com/rfs).

- en: The RFS is a YC tradition — you can find examples going back as far as 2009\.
    Each one offers up ideas we’d want to see made real, in spaces that we believe
    will be important in the coming decades. The world is full of founders with expertise
    that could be tapped into something new and great; our hope is that this list
    inspires some of those people to do so — or if they’re already building, to apply
    to YC.

    the ones we would never expect — but if you aren't sure what you want to work
    on, these RFSs should provide a useful jumping off point to begin your ideation
    process.
