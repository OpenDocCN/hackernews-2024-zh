    Why is this an easy sell? Well, Microsoft could announce they put ChatGPT in a
    toaster and their stock price would jump $5/share. The sad truth is that big tech
    is hyper-focused on doing the things that make their stock prices go up in the
    short-term.'

- en: It's hard to make this connection with quality initiatives. If your software
    is slightly less shitty, the stock price won't jump next week. So instead of being
    able to sell the obvious benefit of shiny new features, you need to have an Engineering
    Manager willing to risk having lower [impact](../impact-based-performance-evaluation)
    for the sake of having a better product. Even if there is broad consensus in your
    team, group, org that these quality improvements are necessary, there's a point
    up the corporate hierarchy where it simply doesn't matter to them. Certainly not
    as much as shipping some feature to great fanfare.

    make them dependent on your product, and then cram in superficial features that

    because they really have no choice but to use your product (an enterprise Office

    they? I'd like to think some smaller competitors will come eat their lunch, but
    I'm not sure. Hopefully we're not all too entrenched in the big tech ecosystem
    for this to happen.
