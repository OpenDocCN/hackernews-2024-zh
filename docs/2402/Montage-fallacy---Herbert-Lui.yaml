- en: The training montage of *Rocky* was the most outstanding part of the story to
    me. It was inspiring to watch Rocky’s personal transformation, from a bum to a
    champion, effectively take place in several minutes.

- en: This kind of montage is a common element in all sorts of movies. It’s an incredibly
    *boring* part of the process. It’s inspiring to watch Rocky run up the stairs
    a few times, making progress with each attempt.

    details would be important though; some days he’d fail, other days he’d get out
    of bed late, and so on, and so forth.

    enough); imagine the amount you would’ve watched him consume if you were a fly
    on the wall.

- en: A film’s need to entertain has obscured the reality about change. Montages set
    an expectation that personal transformations are practically microwaveable; just
    find the right mentor, find the right program, make the perfect plan, do it a
    few times, and you’ll reach your goal. I call this the montage fallacy.

- en: Whenever the statement, “I shouldn’t be experiencing this problem,” or, “That
    successful person doesn’t have to experience this problem,” you’re experiencing
    [the montage fallacy](https://herbertlui.net/developing-a-taste-for-problems/).
    While it’s true your problems may be different from other people’s—what’s [more
    true is that everyone experiences problems of some sort](https://herbertlui.net/developing-a-taste-for-problems/).

- en: There are other statements that reflect the montage fallacy too—like, “I’m not
    going fast enough,” or, “I’d like to skip this experience to the end.”

    they are experiencing montage fallacy.

    manufacturing dissatisfaction with situations, encouraging people to accept it,
    and persuading people that their products are the solution.'

- en: The truth to personal transformation is much more boring—and ugly—than a montage
    will let on. You show up [every day](https://herbertlui.net/what-showing-up-every-day-actually-means/).
    You mostly make small gains, and experience the occasional leap—and persevere
    through setbacks. You have to [choose the things you prioritize](https://herbertlui.net/focus-involves-quitting/),
    which means you’ll decide to give up things you want to do. Because you know most
    shortcuts lead nowhere, you choose the [longcuts](https://herbertlui.net/longcutting/).
    You make sacrifices, big and small, in order to save money so that you have some
    security for when things go wrong, or more options to do what you want to do in
    the future.

- en: P.S., This applies to omissions too. The ones that come to mind immediately
    are Roy offering to train Jamie in *Ted Lasso*, or how Debbie Ocean spent five
    years toiling over the perfect plan while she was in prison in *Ocean’s Eight*.
    (Same goes for how Danny and Rusty gather so much information ahead of time, and
    remember it all perfectly, in their *Ocean’s* franchise.)
