- en: Last November, the American Ornithological Society, or AOS, [announced](https://americanornithology.org/american-ornithological-society-will-change-the-english-names-of-bird-species-named-after-people/)
    that it would change the common names of all American birds named after people.
    There are 152 such “eponymic” names (that is, birds that are named after a specific
    person, like Bicknell’s Thrush) on the AOS’ official checklist, and the group
    is planning to start with between 70 and 80 species predominantly found in the
    U.S. and Canada. In the coming years, birds like Cooper’s Hawk, Wilson’s Snipe,
    and Lincoln’s Sparrow will be stripped of their eponyms and given new common English
    names.

- en: The eponymic naming issue has been heating up in the bird world for a few years
    now. Birds got their English names when they were “discovered” by Western scientists,
    or otherwise identified as a new species. This meant ornithologists had the honor
    of coming up with whatever moniker they wanted, and frequently named birds in
    honor of a benefactor, a friend, or the person who shot the first known specimen.

- en: But a growing number of ornithologists and nonscientist birders are questioning
    why we’re stuck with names decided on a whim hundreds of years ago, especially
    when the names aren’t very good. Some offensive names were changed long ago, like
    the [2000 transition](https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1999-nov-12-mn-32707-story.html)
    of the bird now known as the Long-tailed Duck, but the focus has since shifted
    to birds named for unsavory historical figures. The movement really began in 2020,
    when the group [Bird Names for Birds](https://birdnamesforbirds.wordpress.com/)
    successfully petitioned the AOS to change the name of a species of grassland bird
    then named after Confederate Maj. Gen. John P. McCown to the inoffensive (and
    more descriptive) [Thick-billed Longspur](https://www.audubon.org/news/the-mccowns-longspur-no-more-debate-over-bird-names-continues).

    and its November [announcement](https://www.science.org/content/article/why-are-we-naming-birds-after-people-behind-plan-scrap-many-bird-names)
    landed as a surprise across the natural sciences. Rather than attempt the impossible
    task of reviewing the people with birds named after them one by one, the AOS said
    it would just scrap them all and start from scratch.

- en: But that’s where the real challenge comes in—because lots of bird names are
    pretty bad. Not *offensive* bad, like named after a Confederate general, but just
    *unsatisfactory* bad. There was never any standardization for how common bird
    names were granted, which means those names are all over the place and provide
    little guidance for what renaming should look like.

    the [Red-faced Warbler](https://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/Red-faced_Warbler/overview)
    or the [Swallow-tailed Kite](https://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/Swallow-tailed_Kite/id).
    Others are named for their habitat ([Pine Warbler](https://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/Pine_Warbler),
    [Boreal Owl](https://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/Boreal_Owl)); their relative
    size or range compared to similar birds ([Lesser Yellowlegs](https://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/Lesser_Yellowlegs),
    [Eastern Bluebird](https://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/Eastern_Bluebird)); their
    vocalizations ([Warbling Vireo](https://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/Warbling_Vireo),
    [Piping Plover](https://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/Piping_Plover/)); or the location
    where they were first discovered ([Savannah Sparrow](https://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/Savannah_Sparrow),
    [Kentucky Warbler](https://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/Kentucky_Warbler)). Others
    still have functionally random names, like the onomatopoeic [Bobolink](https://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/Bobolink/overview)
    and [Veery](https://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/Veery), or Osprey, which is derived
    from the Old French word *ospreit*, itself coming from a Latin word meaning “bird
    of prey.”

    seem to be the most popular because they help birders make an identification,
    but species like [Red-bellied Woodpecker](https://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/Red-bellied_Woodpecker)
    and [Ring-necked Duck](https://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/Ring-necked_Duck),
    whose identifying marks are almost impossible to see if you’re not holding the
    bird in your hand, have long been a source of annoyance for birders. Plus, many
    “prominent feature” names aren’t really very helpful, in that they may only apply
    to the male bird and not the female (like the [Black-throated Blue Warbler](https://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/Black-throated_Blue_Warbler)),
    or that the feature only exists during part of the year ([Bay-breasted Warbler](https://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/Bay-breasted_Warbler)).

    Naming a bird after its vocalization is only helpful when the bird is vocalizing,
    and onomatopoeic names aren’t really “helpful” at all. Perhaps worst of all, some
    of the dozens of species that are named after particular geographic locations
    have ludicrous ties between species and spot: [Cape May Warblers](https://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/Cape_May_Warbler)
    and [Philadelphia Vireos](https://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/Philadelphia_Vireo)
    only migrate *through* their namesake cities, and the number of people who see

    on, and it’s not clear how the AOS will embark upon doing so. The group has said
    it will “conduct an open, inclusive, and scientifically rigorous pilot program
    in 2024 to develop its new approach to English bird names in the U.S. and Canada”—but
    there are few specifics yet, and no easy way to organize the public and whittle
    down suggestions in the lawless and nonsensical world of bird names. But the AOS
    has committed to change: Unlike the closed-door decisions of the past, this will
    be a public process. The plan is to take suggestions—from field marks, Indigenous
    names, colloquialisms … from anywhere—narrow it down, somehow, to a few options,
    and let people decide.'

    time, the public will have the chance to think deeply about the birds we love

    thought through new names for common eponymic birds in Maine, this is a process
    full of exciting questions: What makes a Barrow’s Goldeneye a Barrow’s Goldeneye?
    What about the Cooper’s Hawk—its power? Its size?—should be included in its name?'

    Sparrow](https://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/Nelsons_Sparrow) or “Summit Thrush”
    for [Bicknell’s Thrush](https://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/Bicknells_Thrush)—were
    perfect, but rather that we were able to look at common birds with new insight.
    Our new bird names won’t be ideal—none of them are—but, for the first time, they
    will belong to us.
