- en: Captain Ahab’s ivory leg, carved from the jawbone of a whale, stands as one
    of the most iconic pieces of imagery in all of literature. Draw a man with a peg
    leg next to whale and he’s instantly recognizable as Ahab, as is the general idea
    of what happened to the leg and the less than amicable relationship he has with
    that whale. It’s all in the leg; and the leg tells the whole story.

- en: Which is why it’s so maddening, so confounding, that although Melville provides
    the minutest details about every last person, animal, and object in Moby-Dick,
    he fails to tell us *which* leg Ahab is missing. At no point in the novel is it
    stated, or even hinted at, whether that infamous prosthesis fits onto his right
    or his left limb. Not when we’re told of how it was “devoured, chewed up, crunched”
    by Moby Dick; not when Stubb dreams that Ahab kicks him (and then turns oddly
    into a pyramid); and not even when the carpenter takes measurements of Ahab’s
    stump in order to make him a replacement leg when the first one splinters. We
    know up to where and when he lost the leg (off the coast of Japan, on his last
    voyage) and how much of the limb was taken off (just below the knee), but not
    whether it was the left or the right.

- en: Melville scholars have given this question some thought since at least the 1950s,
    attempting to deduce which leg is missing based on clues in the novel. Although
    it’s never been a particular focus of critical analysis of the book, there has
    been curiosity on occasion about whether there’s anything we can learn from how
    Ahab is described performing different activities that might suggest a side, or
    how whaling ships and tools were constructed that could provide insight. But it
    seems that the consensus for some years now has been to leave the mystery alone
    as, despite these efforts, there’s frustratingly scant hard evidence and even
    the best efforts have fallen short of convincing.

    is free to imagine Ahab missing whichever limb they please, if they maintain a
    consistent vision of him at all. Ultimately it has no bearing on the novel whatsoever,
    and Melville may even have intended for there to be ambiguity for some reason
    — though what that reason is we can only speculate. After all, it almost seems
    improbable that he simply forgot to mention it.

    the book in a more practical sense, i.e., illustrators, artists, film directors,

    Melville is generous with details of what the Pequod looked like, the kind of
    clothes they wore, and of course endless descriptions of whales and whaling tools
    and processes, but at some point each artist is left to their own imagination
    to choose a leg: left or right?'

    Concordia University English professor David Ketterer [submitted an article](https://sites.hofstra.edu/melville-society-extracts/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2020/01/Melville-Extracts_054.pdf)
    to the *Melville Society*  *Extracts* newsletter pondering Ahab’s missing limb.
    Ketterer included a brief calculation of leg preference based on about two dozen
    illustrations plus the three Moby-Dick films, relying on a catalog created by
    Germany’s Schleswig-Holstein museum for a [1976 exhibition](https://archive.ph/1Ll6U)
    about the art of Moby-Dick. Counting each Ahab, he discovered a moderate preference
    for the left leg, 18 to 12\.

    to be drawn from the recent collection *Illustrationen zu Melvilles “Moby-Dick.*”
    Of the twenty-seven illustrations and comic strip excerpts included which present
    decipherable full-length portraits, seventeen depict Ahab with a left ivory leg
    while only ten show him with a right one. As for the three film versions, John
    Barrymore, in both The Sea Beast (1926) and the talkie remake Moby-Dick (1930),
    sports a right artificial leg, but Gregory Peck opts for the left in John Huston’s
    1956 adaptation.

- en: The first illustrated edition of Moby-Dick was published in 1896, just five
    years after Melville’s death, featuring four full-page images by artist Augustus
    Barnham Shute. Unfortunately for our purposes, though, Shute actually never shows
    Ahab’s lower half, appearing only once but obscured behind the side of a whale
    boat. (Nor is this all that surprising given that he’s hardly present for a majority
    of the 135 chapters, and doesn’t speak a line until 20 percent of the way into
    the book.) So, beginning with an 1899 edition illustrated by [I.W. Taber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Walton_Taber),
    I created yet another spreadsheet (an unexpected theme for a blog about literature)
    and started flipping through the two dozen or so illustrated copies of Moby-Dick

    Taber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Walton_Taber)插图的版本开始，我又创建了一张电子表格（这是一篇关于文学的博客的意外主题），并开始翻阅我书架上的大约两打《白鲸》插图的复印本。

    to infer anything about which leg is missing from patterns in the adaptations.
    Instead, the more glaring trend that I found is that many artists almost seem
    to *avoid* drawing lower half. While the advantage of avoiding these angles was
    obvious for film, television, and theater adaptations (i.e., relieving actors
    from having to wear a fake prosthesis in every scene), there were even many illustrated
    editions of the book where Ahab’s leg was obscured by other characters, by the
    sides of a whaleboat, or simply shown from the waist up. But, again, this is at
    least partly explained by Ahab barely being present for much of the book. Even
    Rockwell Kent only drew Ahab’s ivory leg four times.
