    A little over a year later, that program, known as ED1, appears to be succeeding
    well beyond anyone’s expectations.

    Since December 2022, more than 16,000 units of deed-restricted affordable housing
    have been proposed through ED1\. As many as three quarters of those homes will
    be built without any public subsidy. Profit-seeking private developers are choosing
    to build income-restricted projects — sometimes in lieu of already approved market-rate
    projects — because of the dramatic time savings and density increases they can
    unlock using this law.

- en: It’s still early days, but these initial results are very promising. LA managed
    to roughly triple its pipeline of affordable housing — approving more units through
    this program in the last 13 months than all affordable housing approved in previous
    three years combined — without dedicating any additional subsidy. It did so by
    treating affordable housing as the emergency that it is, casting aside building
    codes and permitting processes that work against the city’s housing needs.

    through ED1 are not going to be affordable to the lowest-income residents. This
    is going to be middle-income housing, affordable to those making up to 80% of
    the area median income. A single person making $70,000 would qualify for a one-bedroom
    for about $2,000 per month. A family of four making $100,000 would qualify for
    a three-bed for about $2,500.

    — including the [AIDS Healthcare Foundation](https://x.com/CohenSite/status/1702839957763817621?s=20),
    which spends millions of dollars advocating against housing policies like ED1
    — are using the law to build affordable housing for the formerly homeless.) Government
    subsidy will always be required to provide decent housing to the people at the
    bottom of the income distribution. ED1, or programs like it, shouldn’t distract
    from the need for more public spending on deeply affordable housing.
  prefs: []

- en: But this program should demonstrate that scarce housing subsidies need not be
    wasted on the middle class. When given the opportunity to construct simple, high-density
    apartment buildings, developers can profitably offer brand new housing that’s
    affordable to the average person. That’s how healthy housing markets work. That
    this feels like a major revelation shows just how screwy California’s housing
    policy has become.

    cost and complexity to housing projects in cities like LA. Street trees, front
    setbacks, off-street parking, roof decks, façade articulation — these are nice
    to haves, yet LA [requires](https://twitter.com/CohenSite/status/1702837605724025053)
    these features in many cases.

    designed.  Just about all of them, by definition, will be “out of scale” with
    their surroundings. (LA housing activist Joe Cohen has a great [thread](https://x.com/CohenSite/status/1702837604469944695?s=20)
    of renderings of ED1 projects.) I personally think all of that is ok. A housing
    emergency is no time for aesthetic perfection. LA, [like San Francisco](https://benjaminschneider.substack.com/p/san-franciscos-old-housing-policy),
    is finally acting like it.

- en: In 2017, LA voters approved a bond measure dedicating $1.2 billion for the construction
    of 10,000 homes for the formerly homeless. Those homes have taken way too long
    and cost way too much to build. On average, homes built through the program [cost](https://controller.lacity.gov/audits/problems-and-progress-of-prop-hhh)
    around $600,000 per unit, and take about three years to build.  That’s partly
    because of all of the aforementioned everything bagel toppings, and partly due
    to the complex combination of financing sources that affordable housing developers
    need to pull together. Time, uncertainty, and bureaucracy make these projects
    more expensive than they should be.

    per unit, perhaps [as low as $200,000 per unit.](https://x.com/CohenSite/status/1755425700054778068?s=20)

    that some of these for-profit developers are said to be targeting Section 8 tenants.
    Therefore, these projects will, in a sense, be [subsidized](https://x.com/spiroferrer/status/1755407961013526555?s=20).
    Even if every for-profit ED1 developer were pursuing this strategy, which I doubt,
    I don’t see why that would be problematic. The number of Section 8 vouchers is
    fixed, and doesn’t come at the expense of other affordable housing funding programs.
    Plus, it’s [notoriously difficult](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2022-07-25/emergency-housing-vouchers-story)
    for Section 8 voucher holders to find willing landlords in LA, such that thousands
    of vouchers go unused. A huge infusion of brand new apartments targeting Section
    8 tenants would be a boon for voucher holders. Indeed, if housing assistance were
    ever to become an entitlement, as it should be, there would need to be a massive
    increase in the supply of rental housing with willing landlords.

    housing is allowed in Los Angeles, including single-family neighborhoods. A handful
    of projects were quickly proposed in single-family zones, many of them in the
    San Fernando Valley. Following a NIMBY outcry, Mayor Bass subsequently tweaked
    the policy to exempt these areas. Now, more than [1,400 units](https://laist.com/news/housing-homelessness/los-angeles-housing-affordable-executive-directive-one-ed1-mayor-karen-bass-raman-blumenfield-yimby-lawsuit)

    quarters of units proposed through ED1 wouldn’t have qualified for the program.
    (Again, see Cohen’s [thread](https://x.com/CohenSite/status/1702837604469944695?s=20)

    program is attractive to developers precisely because LA’s normal housing policies
    are so onerous and restrictive. For developers, the benefit of getting out of
    those requirements outweighs the burden of providing below-market rents.
