    Last year, it seemed like there was no reason to believe Spotify would ever roll
    out its long-delayed HiFi lossless streaming feature, which was announced in 2021
    and then never mentioned again. But then, one of the company’s co-presidents [kept
    hope alive](/2023/3/14/23639674/spotify-hifi-co-president-still-coming), telling
    my colleague Alex Heath “we are going to do it.”

    day after Spotify HiFi’s [buzzy original announcement](/2021/2/22/22295273/spotify-hifi-announced-lossless-streaming-hd-quality),
    and still nothing. Like always, there are signs that the company is continuing
    to work on HiFi — although it’s unlikely to be called that anymore. And unlike
    rival services, you’re likely going to have to pay a lot more for it, whenever
    it actually arrives.

- en: The current presumption is that high-resolution and lossless streaming will
    be packaged into an upcoming, more expensive “Supremium” tier that will include
    a slew of other exclusive perks; we’ve even seen [Spotify’s branding for the plan](/2023/10/5/23905328/spotifys-supremium-plan-and-lossless-audio-are-inching-closer-to-release).
    Many people constantly hammer on the point that it’s hard for the average listener
    to tell any difference between lossless audio and the compressed music that Spotify
    is already providing. So the company clearly understands that it needs to piece
    together a much more compelling bundle for a higher-priced subscription to have
    any shot at success.

    taking so long*? It’s believed that Spotify was caught totally flat-footed when
    Apple and Amazon both started giving customers higher-fidelity audio at no extra
    cost, and that its own deals with labels didn’t make it financially viable for
    the leading streaming music service to do the same. Unlike its competitors, Spotify
    doesn’t have other divisions to help recoup the cost of an aggressive play like
    that, which I completely understand. But I’ve got to believe that lossless audio
    has been factored into any deals that the company has agreed upon more recently.'

    algorithms are always on point and have come to nail down my taste through years
    of listening data. My [daylists](/2024/2/13/24071648/spotifys-daylist-is-like-im-feeling-lucky-for-music)

    And sometimes I just want to plug in my USB-C dongle, lay on the couch, and truly
    sink into a new album. And it’s those moments where I’m inevitably disappointed
    with Spotify, because I *know* what I’m hearing isn’t the best it can be. I’m
    paying for an objectively inferior listening experience. Well, I *was*. A couple
    months ago, I got tired of waiting, so I let my longtime Spotify subscription
    lapse and purchased a year’s worth of Apple Music.

- en: Knowing my luck, Spotify could announce its Supremium plan mere weeks from now
    at its Stream On event — if it holds one this year — right after I bailed on my
    account. And if it does, depending on what else is thrown in, there’s a very good
    chance I’ll resubscribe. That’s doubly true if the more expensive plan means even
    slightly better payouts for artists. Apple Music feels a lot cleaner and more
    focused than the hybrid music / podcasts destination that Spotify has become.
    But it doesn’t *get* me quite as well. Maybe that’ll change over the course of
    this yearlong plan. Judging by history, I’ll have some time to give it a chance.
