    Last year, it seemed like there was no reason to believe Spotify would ever roll
    out its long-delayed HiFi lossless streaming feature, which was announced in 2021
    and then never mentioned again. But then, one of the company’s co-presidents [kept
    hope alive](/2023/3/14/23639674/spotify-hifi-co-president-still-coming), telling
    my colleague Alex Heath “we are going to do it.”

  zh: 我真的希望我不必再[做这件事情了](/2023/2/22/23608937/spotify-hifi-lossless-audio-two-years-later)。去年，似乎没有理由相信Spotify会推出其长期推迟的HiFi无损音频流功能，该功能在2021年宣布后再也没有提及。但是，该公司的一位联合总裁[仍然保持希望](/2023/3/14/23639674/spotify-hifi-co-president-still-coming)，告诉我的同事亚历克斯·希斯：“我们会做到的。”
- en: That was in March 2023\. And now here we find ourselves, three years and one
    day after Spotify HiFi’s [buzzy original announcement](/2021/2/22/22295273/spotify-hifi-announced-lossless-streaming-hd-quality),
    and still nothing. Like always, there are signs that the company is continuing
    to work on HiFi — although it’s unlikely to be called that anymore. And unlike
    rival services, you’re likely going to have to pay a lot more for it, whenever
    it actually arrives.

  zh: 那是在2023年3月。现在我们发现自己，Spotify HiFi的[轰动性原始宣布](/2021/2/22/22295273/spotify-hifi-announced-lossless-streaming-hd-quality)已经过去三年一天，但依然一无所获。像往常一样，公司仍在继续开发HiFi
    —— 尽管现在可能不会再这么称呼了。而且与竞争对手不同，你可能需要为此付出更多的代价，无论它真正到来时会是何种形式。
- en: The current presumption is that high-resolution and lossless streaming will
    be packaged into an upcoming, more expensive “Supremium” tier that will include
    a slew of other exclusive perks; we’ve even seen [Spotify’s branding for the plan](/2023/10/5/23905328/spotifys-supremium-plan-and-lossless-audio-are-inching-closer-to-release).
    Many people constantly hammer on the point that it’s hard for the average listener
    to tell any difference between lossless audio and the compressed music that Spotify
    is already providing. So the company clearly understands that it needs to piece
    together a much more compelling bundle for a higher-priced subscription to have
    any shot at success.

- en: 'None of that really answers the overarching question, though: *what the hell’s
    taking so long*? It’s believed that Spotify was caught totally flat-footed when
    Apple and Amazon both started giving customers higher-fidelity audio at no extra
    cost, and that its own deals with labels didn’t make it financially viable for
    the leading streaming music service to do the same. Unlike its competitors, Spotify
    doesn’t have other divisions to help recoup the cost of an aggressive play like
    that, which I completely understand. But I’ve got to believe that lossless audio
    has been factored into any deals that the company has agreed upon more recently.'

  zh: 然而，这些都没有真正回答主要问题：**为什么要花这么长时间**？人们认为，当Apple和Amazon都开始免费提供更高保真音频时，Spotify完全措手不及，而且其与唱片公司的协议没有使其在财务上能够做出同样的举措。与竞争对手不同，Spotify没有其他部门来帮助收回这样一个激进的举动的成本，我完全理解这一点。但我必须相信，无损音频已经被纳入了公司最近达成的任何协议中。

    And sometimes I just want to plug in my USB-C dongle, lay on the couch, and truly
    sink into a new album. And it’s those moments where I’m inevitably disappointed
    with Spotify, because I *know* what I’m hearing isn’t the best it can be. I’m
    paying for an objectively inferior listening experience. Well, I *was*. A couple
    months ago, I got tired of waiting, so I let my longtime Spotify subscription
    lapse and purchased a year’s worth of Apple Music.

  zh: 但我也是一个拥有几副非常好的耳机和耳塞的音频爱好者。有时候，我只是想插上我的USB-C转接头，躺在沙发上，真正沉浸在一张新专辑中。正是在这些时刻，我不可避免地对Spotify感到失望，因为我知道我听到的并不是最好的。我在为一个客观上较差的听音体验买单。嗯，我曾经是。几个月前，我厌倦了等待，于是让我长期使用的Spotify订阅到期，并购买了一年的Apple
    Music服务。
- en: Knowing my luck, Spotify could announce its Supremium plan mere weeks from now
    at its Stream On event — if it holds one this year — right after I bailed on my
    account. And if it does, depending on what else is thrown in, there’s a very good
    chance I’ll resubscribe. That’s doubly true if the more expensive plan means even
    slightly better payouts for artists. Apple Music feels a lot cleaner and more
    focused than the hybrid music / podcasts destination that Spotify has become.
    But it doesn’t *get* me quite as well. Maybe that’ll change over the course of
    this yearlong plan. Judging by history, I’ll have some time to give it a chance.

  zh: 知道我的运气，Spotify可能会在其Stream On活动中宣布其Supremium计划，如果他们今年举行的话，可能就在我放弃账户之后的几周内。如果确实如此，根据其他附加内容，我很可能会重新订阅。如果更贵的计划意味着艺术家获得稍微更好的报酬，这一可能性更大。Apple
    Music感觉比Spotify更清洁、更专注，而后者已经变成了混合音乐/播客的目的地。但它并没有像我预期的那样完全理解我。也许在这一年的计划期间会有所改变。从历史来看，我会有一些时间来尝试它。
