- en: The year 2022 was stressful. My family was trying and failing to buy a house,
    because the housing market was insane. Of course, this was a first-world problem.
    On February 24, 2022, the Russian army invaded Ukraine, my home country, which
    I left in 2010, but still consider home. Friends and relatives lost homes, jobs,
    and any security in their future.

    reject it. However, I was not able to process the details just yet. I had too
    many feelings to get over. So I screamed and cried.

    for a new job ASAP. Of course, we postponed our house search. We had savings,
    but I didn’t want to dip into them, and I also was the one to provide medical
    insurance coverage for my whole family, because my husband worked as a contractor
    with no benefits.

- en: I had a lot of connections with my ex-coworkers. One of my coworkers from [Parse.ly](https://www.parse.ly/)
    was just hired at [Coiled](https://www.coiled.io/), a data engineering startup.
    Coiled is the company behind Dask, a distributed data processing framework written
    in Python. I have been interested in Dask for a long time, so I applied for one
    of their open positions. I was able to pass their interviews, and I started a
    new job as a backend engineer in Coiled in January 2023.

- en: I learned a lot while working at Coiled, but it was very different from Elastic.
    Elastic was a large company, where every process was structured and formalized.
    Coiled was a small startup where directions changed all the time, and nothing
    was ever clear-cut. In addition, I still felt shell-shocked after the Elastic
    layoff. I no longer had confidence that I was a good engineer. So I thought, perhaps
    I should keep a low profile, listen more, speak less, work hard, and concentrate
    on being as useful as possible.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To this day, I don’t know what went wrong with Coiled. Perhaps the decision
    to keep a low profile was wrong. Perhaps I wasn’t useful enough. I never felt
    that the more senior engineers on the team fully accepted me; I didn’t have a
    feeling of belonging. Still, some of the teammates I worked with were great, we
    collaborated very well together, and I believed that the rest of the team would
    accept me too, once I became more experienced with the project and could deliver
    more value.

    gave me 6 weeks —not too bad for a startup. I started searching for a new job
    immediately, but I was not as lucky. It took me a lot longer to find a new job.
    It was August 2023, more and more companies embraced the frugal mindset, and the
    market was flooded with engineers laid off from Twitter, Google, Meta, etc.

- en: I needed to have surgery (not life-threatening). With Coiled, I was covered
    by medical insurance until the end of August, and I asked the surgeon to please
    try and schedule it while still within coverage. As part of a pre-surgery checkup,
    the doctor sent me to have a lung X-ray. An hour after the X-ray appointment,
    when I had barely got back, I received a call from the doctor.

    came to pass, my kids (daughter and son, then 9 and 3 years old) would have to
    grow up without their mom, and how hard it would be for them to see me dying.
    I was still studying, doing job interviews, and handling recruiter phone calls.

    be of any value to any company again, or anyone else, for that matter. The happiness
    of not dying gave me some peace of mind, but it wasn’t enough to overcome all
    the other things that happened. So I stopped writing about software development,
    data analysis, or anything else; I didn’t sign up for any conferences or meetups;
    I didn’t regain the ability or desire to speak in public. I hid.
