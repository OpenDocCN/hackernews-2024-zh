    because the housing market was insane. Of course, this was a first-world problem.
    On February 24, 2022, the Russian army invaded Ukraine, my home country, which
    I left in 2010, but still consider home. Friends and relatives lost homes, jobs,

    was just hired at [Coiled](https://www.coiled.io/), a data engineering startup.
    Coiled is the company behind Dask, a distributed data processing framework written
    in Python. I have been interested in Dask for a long time, so I applied for one
    of their open positions. I was able to pass their interviews, and I started a

  zh: Coiled
- en: I learned a lot while working at Coiled, but it was very different from Elastic.
    Elastic was a large company, where every process was structured and formalized.
    Coiled was a small startup where directions changed all the time, and nothing
    was ever clear-cut. In addition, I still felt shell-shocked after the Elastic
    layoff. I no longer had confidence that I was a good engineer. So I thought, perhaps
    I should keep a low profile, listen more, speak less, work hard, and concentrate
    on being as useful as possible.
  id: totrans-split-22
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 我在Coiled工作期间学到了很多，但这与Elastic大不相同。Elastic是一家大公司，所有流程都是结构化和正式的。Coiled是一家小型创业公司，方向经常变动，没有一成不变的事情。此外，Elastic裁员后，我仍然感到震惊。我不再相信自己是一个优秀的工程师。所以我想，也许我应该低调些，多听少说，努力工作，集中精力尽可能地发挥作用。
- en: To this day, I don’t know what went wrong with Coiled. Perhaps the decision
    to keep a low profile was wrong. Perhaps I wasn’t useful enough. I never felt
    that the more senior engineers on the team fully accepted me; I didn’t have a
    feeling of belonging. Still, some of the teammates I worked with were great, we
    collaborated very well together, and I believed that the rest of the team would
    accept me too, once I became more experienced with the project and could deliver
    more value.
  id: totrans-split-23

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 直到今天，我也不知道Coiled出了什么问题。也许保持低调的决定是错的。也许我不够有用。我从未感觉到团队的更高级工程师完全接受我；我没有归属感。尽管如此，我与一些同事合作非常好，我们之间的协作很顺畅，我相信在我对项目更加熟悉并能提供更多价值后，团队的其他成员也会接受我。
