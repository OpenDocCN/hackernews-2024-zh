  zh: 食品作家[波比·坎农](http://thehairpin.com/2012/03/the-first-sandra-lee-poppy-cannon-and-her-can-opener-cuisine/)及其*Can-Opener
    Cookbook*（1951年）的流行使得罐装、冷冻和即食产品进入了数百万家庭厨房。由食品公司出版的品牌烹饪书籍推广了即食产品。[中世纪菜单](http://www.midcenturymenu.com/)博客作者露丝·克拉克指出（http://www.collectorsweekly.com/articles/the-1950s-most-nauseating-jell-o-soaked-recipes/），填满整本烹饪书经常意味着把食物硬塞到绝对不适合的地方：
- en: '*"Many of the crazier recipes came from brand-specific cookbooks produced by
    companies trying to put their products into every single part of your meal. That''s
    easy to do with some stuff, like salt, but when you''re talking about things like
    cans of condensed tomato soup or ketchup, it''s a little more difficult to put
    those into a dessert."*'

  zh: '*“许多更疯狂的食谱来自于企业出版的品牌特定烹饪书，这些企业试图让他们的产品涵盖到您餐食的每个角落。有些东西很容易做到，比如盐，但当您谈论到浓缩番茄汤或番茄酱之类的东西时，要把它们放在甜点中就有些困难了。”*'
- en: 'They also tended to involve ridiculously simple recipes: Mix one can of this
    into one can of that, add miniature marshmallows, serve. The magic was in the
    presentation: vegetable garnishes lovingly shaped into roses; mayonnaise dyed
    with food coloring to fit a theme; a molded fish shape, adorned with olives for
    eyes, on a decorative bed of lettuce and crackers.'

  zh: 他们也倾向于使用极其简单的食谱：混合一罐这个和一罐那个，加入迷你棉花糖，上桌。魔法在于呈现方式：将蔬菜装饰成玫瑰形状；用食用色素染色的蛋黄酱以适应主题；鱼形模具，眼睛点缀橄榄，放在装饰性的生菜和饼干上。
- en: 'Gelatin-based dishes were a staple of this genre, especially since shaped molds
    allowed for elaborate presentations. Cooks could showcase ingredients with a clear
    gelatin or aspic, using "sinkers" and "floaters" to achieve a certain look, or
    fold cream or mayo into the gelatin for an opaque appearance. Savory salads often
    involved "frostings" made with shrimp or mayonnaise to complete the look. My great-grandmother''s
    copy of *Knox on Camera Recipes: A Completely New Guide to Gel Cookery*, published
    in 1960, includes such unappetizing concoctions as "Green Salad Mold," "Molded
    Avocado and Tuna," and "Jellied Veal Loaf" (complete with two teaspoons of MSG).
    The standard cookbooks of the era, like the 1964 edition of *The Joy of Cooking*,
    devote entire sections to savory gelatin salads. Jell-O even introduced savory
    flavors, like celery, mixed vegetable, and "Italian salad," during the 1960s.
    By the mid-1970s, though, their popularity had declined so much that they were
    pulled from shelves.'

  zh: '基于明胶的菜肴是这一流派的主打，尤其是由于各种造型的模具使得展示更加精致。厨师们可以用明胶或肉凝胶清晰展示食材，利用“沉浮物”和“浮标”来达到特定的外观效果，或者将奶油或蛋黄酱折叠到明胶中，使其呈不透明外观。香味沙拉通常包括用虾或蛋黄酱制成的“霜化层”来完善外观。1960年出版的《Knox相机菜谱：全新明胶烹饪指南》（Knox
    on Camera Recipes: A Completely New Guide to Gel Cookery）是我曾祖母的一本书，其中包括诸如“绿色沙拉模型”、“银鱼与金枪鱼模型”和“明胶牛肉卷”（配有两茶匙味精）等令人不感兴趣的调配。当时的标准烹饪书籍，如1964年版的《烹饪的乐趣》（The
    Joy of Cooking），专门为香味明胶沙拉分配了整整一章。20世纪60年代，Jell-O甚至推出了芹菜、混合蔬菜和“意大利沙拉”等香味。但到了70年代中期，它们的流行度下降得如此之快，以至于被撤出了货架。'

- en: 'What happened? For one thing, dieting fashions changed. Salad courses had,
    for decades, been edging toward the border of dessert, but in the 1970s and ''80s,
    nutrition campaigns began to emphasize the importance of eliminating sugar. Savory
    Jell-O salads fell out of fashion, replaced by tossed salads and a fad for sun-dried
    tomatoes. This was also when the efforts of the women''s movement began to bear
    fruit: Women were entering the workforce in unprecedented numbers, and more and
    more women were heads of households. Convenience foods much more convenient than
    gelatin were readily available, and working mothers were quick to choose fast,
    microwave-friendly options.'

  zh: 发生了什么？一方面，饮食时尚发生了变化。几十年来，沙拉菜品一直在逐步接近甜点的边界，但在70年代和80年代，营养运动开始强调消除糖的重要性。香味明胶沙拉退出了流行潮流，被拌沙拉和日晒干番茄的时尚所取代。这也是女性运动成果开始显现的时候：女性以前所未有的数量进入职场，越来越多的女性成为家庭的主要负责人。比明胶更方便的便捷食品随处可得，工作中的母亲们迅速选择了快速、微波友好的选择。
- en: Gelatin brands went back to focusing on marketing their products as snacks and
    desserts, even adding sugar-free options to their product lines. Jell-O introduced
    its Pudding Pops and Gelatin Pops and marketed them heavily with a famous ad campaign
    featuring then-beloved comedian Bill Cosby. Plain Jell-O and sweet Jell-O salads
    are still widely consumed in the US, especially in the rural Midwest and the Deep
    South. Savory Jell-O salads do, however, remain popular in Utah and other heavily
    Mormon areas. "There will be at least four or five kinds of Jell-O salads at any
    event," almost all of them savory, Sariah Hilliam of Roosevelt, Utah, told the
    *Los Angeles Times* in 2002\. In fact, this region is often nicknamed the "Jell-O
    Belt," and in 2001, the state of Utah named Jell-O its [official state snack](http://azdailysun.com/jell-o-named-utah-s-official-state-snack/article_b3793b4d-8270-5698-9e7d-d0a53ec50cdb.html).

  zh: 明胶品牌重新把重点放在将其产品作为零食和甜点进行市场推广，甚至增加了无糖选项。Jell-O推出了其布丁冰棒和明胶冰棒，并通过著名广告系列，与当时备受喜爱的喜剧演员比尔·柯斯比强力推广。在美国，纯Jell-O和甜Jell-O沙拉仍然广泛消费，尤其是在农村中西部和深南部地区。然而，在犹他州和其他摩门教徒聚居地区，咸Jell-O沙拉仍然很受欢迎。“任何活动中至少会有四五种Jell-O沙拉”，2002年Sariah
    Hilliam告诉*洛杉矶时报*。事实上，这个地区经常被称为“Jell-O带”，并且在2001年，犹他州将Jell-O定为其[官方州零食](http://azdailysun.com/jell-o-named-utah-s-official-state-snack/article_b3793b4d-8270-5698-9e7d-d0a53ec50cdb.html)。

    uses](https://www.seriouseats.com/how-to-use-gelatin-better-stock-sauce-dessert),
    and gelatinous treats have found their way to urban shores by way of Asia, where
    jellied textures have never gone out of style. In teahouses and restaurants across
    North America, tapioca pearls dot cold glasses of bubble tea, savory aspics melt
    into glorious fillings for soup dumplings, and chewy rice-based mochi provide
    a sweet finish. Domestically, molecular gastronomists are experimenting with creative
    uses for gelatin in savory dishes, from Grant Achatz's soy gel to Wylie Dufresne's
    [shrimp "spaghetti."](http://www.tinyurbankitchen.com/wylie-dufresne-meat-glue-mania/)
    In home kitchens, its uses range from meatballs to pâté and beyond.
