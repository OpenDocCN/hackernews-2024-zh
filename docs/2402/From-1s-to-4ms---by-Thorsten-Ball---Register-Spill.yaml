    that Sublime Text is faster when searching for all occurrences of the current
    word in a buffer. Zed takes 1s and Sublime somewhere around 200ms.

    hit `cmd-shift-l` and all occurrences of that word in the current buffer are selected
    and you get a cursor at each occurrence, ready to play some multi-cursor rock’n’roll.'

    for computers” then yes, you’re right, 4ms *is* an eternity for computers, yes,
    I agree, *but* based on that reaction I bet that you didn’t grew up like I did
    as a programmer. See, I grew up building websites, web applications, backends,
    that kind of stuff and in that world basically *nothing* takes 4ms. If it takes
    me 10ms to ping the closest data center in Frankfurt, how can I deliver something
    to you over the wire in less than that?
