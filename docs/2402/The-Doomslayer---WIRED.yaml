- en: Nor should they have come as any great surprise, once you gave the matter some
    thought. Plants and animals used for food constitute "populations" just as human
    beings do, and so they, too, ought to increase not arithmetically, as Malthus
    claimed, but geometrically. The food supply, in other words, ought to keep pace
    with human population growth, thereby leaving all of us well-fed, happy, and snug
    in our beds.

  zh: 同样，一旦你仔细考虑了这个问题，它也不应该给你带来什么惊讶。用于食物的植物和动物与人类一样构成“种群”，因此它们也应该像人类一样呈几何级增长，而不是像马尔萨斯所说的算术级增长。换句话说，食物供应应该跟上人口增长的步伐，从而让我们所有人都能吃饱、快乐，安然入睡。

    if you look at the facts - as opposed to spinning out theories - you find precisely
    the reverse of the situation described by Malthus. Just the opposite!

  zh: 西蒙发现，这确实是整个历史上一直发生的事情。因此，如果你查看事实 - 而不是推出理论 - 你会发现马尔萨斯描述的情况恰好相反！正好相反！
- en: 'Simon acquired his habit of looking up the facts in early childhood, at the
    dinner table of the family home in Newark, New Jersey. He''d be in some argument
    with his father over the benefits of exercise, the price of butter, or the health
    value of air conditioning, and whether from ignorance, pigheadedness, or general
    perversity, his father would always take some outlandish, off-the-wall viewpoint,
    such as: "The price of butter is 8 cents a pound."'

  zh: 西蒙在幼年时期就养成了查找事实的习惯，在新泽西州纽瓦克的家庭餐桌上。他和父亲在运动的好处、黄油的价格或者空调的健康价值等方面总是争论不休，而他的父亲总是因为无知、顽固或者一般倔强而持一些古怪的、不靠谱的观点，比如：“黄油的价格是每磅
    8 美分。”

- en: It's an attitude that drives him crazy to this day - people who know in advance
    what the truth is, who don't need to avail themselves of any "facts." But Simon
    loves facts and figures, he loves tables, charts, graphs, information arranged
    in rows and columns. Tabulations, the slopes of curves, diagrams, pie charts,
    histograms - he's a regular Mr. Data.

  zh: 至今这种态度仍然让他发疯 - 预先知道真相的人们，根本不需要任何“事实”。但是西蒙喜欢事实和数据，他喜欢表格、图表、曲线斜率、图表、直方图 - 他简直就是一个数据先生。
- en: Of course, since people don't particularly like to have their cherished beliefs
    contradicted by heaps of facts served up on a platter, Simon has never been Mr.
    Popularity. He got fired from jobs in the navy because he hated the customary
    ass-kissing, sucking-up, and yessir requirements. Nor has he ever been much for
    schmoozing, glad-handing, or the latter-day manners of get-along, go-along.

  zh: 当然，由于人们不喜欢在一盘子里堆满事实后对自己心爱的信念感到反驳，西蒙从来不是一个受欢迎的人物。他因为讨厌传统上的拍马屁、拍马屁和顺从的要求而被海军解雇。他也从不喜欢谄媚、握手或者说得来、干得成这些后来的举止方式。

  zh: 但这一切并没有在学术上阻碍他。他在哈佛大学获得了实验心理学学士学位，在芝加哥大学获得了工商管理硕士学位，两年后，也就是1961年，他在同一所学校获得了商业经济学博士学位。
- en: He was not one of those MBAs whose closest contact with the gritty business
    world was going down to the corner newsstand to purchase a copy of *The Wall Street
    Journal*. The year he got his doctorate he started and operated his own business,
    a mail-order firm that sold quality teas, coffees, and a book on how to make beer
    at home. The enterprise was successful enough, but not so much as the book he
    later wrote about it, *How to Start and Operate a Mail-Order Business* (McGraw-Hill,
    1965), still in print and currently in its fifth edition.

  zh: 他不是那些 MBA 中的一员，他与现实的商业世界的最亲密接触就是去街角的报摊买份*华尔街日报*。他在拿到博士学位的那年开始并经营自己的生意，一个邮购公司，销售优质的茶叶、咖啡和一本家庭酿造啤酒的书。这个企业相当成功，但没有他后来撰写的那本关于它的书籍成功，*如何开办和运营邮购业务*（McGraw-Hill，1965），至今仍在印刷，目前已是第五版。
