- en: Nor should they have come as any great surprise, once you gave the matter some
    thought. Plants and animals used for food constitute "populations" just as human
    beings do, and so they, too, ought to increase not arithmetically, as Malthus
    claimed, but geometrically. The food supply, in other words, ought to keep pace
    with human population growth, thereby leaving all of us well-fed, happy, and snug
    in our beds.

    if you look at the facts - as opposed to spinning out theories - you find precisely
    the reverse of the situation described by Malthus. Just the opposite!

    dinner table of the family home in Newark, New Jersey. He''d be in some argument
    with his father over the benefits of exercise, the price of butter, or the health
    value of air conditioning, and whether from ignorance, pigheadedness, or general
    perversity, his father would always take some outlandish, off-the-wall viewpoint,
    such as: "The price of butter is 8 cents a pound."'

    look things up in books, and come back with a ream of facts and data. His father,
    however, couldn't care less.

    what the truth is, who don't need to avail themselves of any "facts." But Simon
    loves facts and figures, he loves tables, charts, graphs, information arranged
    in rows and columns. Tabulations, the slopes of curves, diagrams, pie charts,
    histograms - he's a regular Mr. Data.

    contradicted by heaps of facts served up on a platter, Simon has never been Mr.
    Popularity. He got fired from jobs in the navy because he hated the customary
    ass-kissing, sucking-up, and yessir requirements. Nor has he ever been much for
    schmoozing, glad-handing, or the latter-day manners of get-along, go-along.

    psychology from Harvard, an MBA from the University of Chicago, and, two years
    later, in 1961, a PhD in business economics from the same school.

- en: He was not one of those MBAs whose closest contact with the gritty business
    world was going down to the corner newsstand to purchase a copy of *The Wall Street
    Journal*. The year he got his doctorate he started and operated his own business,
    a mail-order firm that sold quality teas, coffees, and a book on how to make beer
    at home. The enterprise was successful enough, but not so much as the book he
    later wrote about it, *How to Start and Operate a Mail-Order Business* (McGraw-Hill,
    1965), still in print and currently in its fifth edition.
