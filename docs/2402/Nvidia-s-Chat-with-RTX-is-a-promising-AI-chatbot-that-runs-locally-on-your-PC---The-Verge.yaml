- en: Nvidia is releasing an early version of [Chat with RTX](https://go.redirectingat.com/?xs=1&id=1025X1701640&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nvidia.com%2Fen-us%2Fai-on-rtx%2Fchat-with-rtx-generative-ai%2F)
    today, a demo app that lets you run a personal AI chatbot on your PC. You can
    feed it YouTube videos and your own documents to create summaries and get relevant
    answers based on your own data. It all runs locally on a PC, and all you need
    is an RTX 30- or 40-series GPU with at least 8GB of VRAM.

    the app is a little rough around the edges, I can already see this being a valuable
    part of data research for journalists or anyone who needs to analyze a collection
    of documents.

- en: Chat with RTX can handle YouTube videos, so you simply input a URL, and it lets
    you search transcripts for specific mentions or summarize an entire video. I found
    this ideal for searching through video podcasts, particularly for finding specific
    mentions in podcasts over the past week amid rumors of Microsoft’s new [Xbox strategy
    shift](/2024/2/12/24067370/microsoft-xbox-playstation-switch-games-future-hardware).

    the transcript of a *Verge* YouTube video, and Chat with RTX downloaded the transcript
    for a completely different video. It wasn’t even one that I had queried before,
    so there are clearly bugs in this early demo.

    I also created a dataset of *FTC v. Microsoft* documents for Chat with RTX to
    analyze. When I was covering the court case last year, it was often overwhelming
    to search through documents at speed, but Chat with RTX helped me query them nearly
    instantly on my PC.

- en: Based on the provided context information, Xbox Game Pass is a content subscription
    service in gaming that provides access to a library of games for a single monthly
    fee. It is envisioned as a platform that empowers players to play their games
    anywhere and allows publishers to reach players everywhere. The service is supported
    by Project xCloud and Xbox Series X, and it aims to create a fertile ground for
    publishers to monetize their games. The primary strategic objective for the Gaming
    CSA is to scale Xbox Game Pass, and it is believed that there is a significant
    subscriber opportunity globally, with a potential of 750 million subscribers.
    The service faces three primary content dynamics, including the need for differentiated
    content, expanding beyond console, and limited content supply.

    own Copilot system doesn’t handle PDFs well within Word, but Nvidia’s Chat with
    RTX had no problem pulling out all the key information. The responses are near
    instant as well, with none of the lag you usually see when using cloud-based ChatGPT
    or Copilot chatbots.

- en: The big drawback to Chat with RTX is that it *really* feels like an early developer
    demo. Chat with RTX essentially installs a web server and Python instance on your
    PC, which then leverages Mistral or Llama 2 models to query the data you feed
    it. It then utilizes Nvidia’s Tensor cores on an RTX GPU to speed up your queries.

- en: It took around 30 minutes for Chat with RTX to install on my PC, which is powered
    by an Intel Core i9-14900K processor with an RTX 4090 GPU. The app is nearly 40GB
    in size, and the Python instance takes up around 3GB of RAM out of the 64GB available
    on my system. Once it’s running, you access Chat with RTX from a browser, while
    a command prompt runs in the background spewing out what’s being processed and
    any error codes.

- en: Nvidia isn’t offering this as a polished app that all RTX owners should download
    and install immediately. There are a number of known issues and limitations, including
    that source attribution isn’t always accurate. I also initially attempted to get
    Chat with RTX to index 25,000 documents, but this seemed to crash the app, and
    I had to clear the preferences to get going again.

- en: Chat with RTX also doesn’t remember context, so follow-up questions can’t be
    based on the context of a previous question. It also creates JSON files inside
    the folders you ask it to index, so I wouldn’t recommend using this on your entire
    Documents folder in Windows.

    It shows the promise of what an AI chatbot can do locally on your PC in the future,
    especially if you don’t want to have to subscribe to something like [Copilot Pro](/2024/1/15/24038711/microsoft-copilot-pro-office-ai-apps)
    or [ChatGPT Plus](/2023/10/29/23937497/chatgpt-plus-new-beta-all-tools-update-pdf-data-analysis)
    just to analyze your personal files.
