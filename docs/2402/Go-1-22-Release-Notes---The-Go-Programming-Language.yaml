    Most of its changes are in the implementation of the toolchain, runtime, and libraries.
    As always, the release maintains the Go 1 [promise of compatibility](/doc/go1compat).
    We expect almost all Go programs to continue to compile and run as before.

- en: The runtime now keeps type-based garbage collection metadata nearer to each
    heap object, improving the CPU performance (latency or throughput) of Go programs
    by 1–3%. This change also reduces the memory overhead of the majority Go programs
    by approximately 1% by deduplicating redundant metadata. Some programs may see
    a smaller improvement because this change adjusts the size class boundaries of
    the memory allocator, so some objects may be moved up a size class.
  id: totrans-split-41
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A consequence of this change is that some objects’ addresses that were previously
    always aligned to a 16 byte (or higher) boundary will now only be aligned to an
    8 byte boundary. Some programs that use assembly instructions that require memory
    addresses to be more than 8-byte aligned and rely on the memory allocator’s previous
    alignment behavior may break, but we expect such programs to be rare. Such programs
    may be built with `GOEXPERIMENT=noallocheaders` to revert to the old metadata
    layout and restore the previous alignment behavior, but package owners should
    update their assembly code to avoid the alignment assumption, as this workaround
    will be removed in a future release.
