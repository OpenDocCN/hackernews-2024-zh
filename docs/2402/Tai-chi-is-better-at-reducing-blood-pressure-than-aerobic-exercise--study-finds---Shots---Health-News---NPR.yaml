- en: Tai chi, a traditional, slow-moving form of Chinese martial art, is known to
    increase flexibility and improve balance. Now, new research suggests it's better
    than more vigorous aerobic exercises for lowering blood pressure in people with
    prehypertension.

    reach the level of high blood pressure, or hypertension. It's considered a warning
    sign that heart disease may be ahead, and it raises the risk of having a heart
    attack.

    add to a large body of research pointing to health benefits from tai chi, a wellness
    practice that combines slow, gentle movements and postures with mindfulness. It's
    often called meditation in motion.

- en: In the study, researchers in China randomly assigned 342 adults with prehypertension
    to one of two interventions. The average age of participants was 49\. Roughly
    half the people participated in supervised aerobic exercise, including jogging,
    climbing stairs, brisk walking and cycling. The other half was trained to practice
    tai chi. Both groups got hourlong sessions four times a week.

    pressure than those in the aerobic exercise group. What's more, nearly 22% of
    the people who practiced tai chi saw their blood pressure fall to within normal
    range, compared with nearly 16% of people in the aerobic exercise group. And fewer
    patients in the tai chi group went on to develop hypertension than in the aerobic
    exercise group.

    to elicit more of a response from the parasympathetic nervous system, says [Ruth
    Taylor-Piliae](https://www.nursing.arizona.edu/rpiliae), a professor at the University
    of Arizona's College of Nursing, who was not involved in the study. The [parasympathetic
    nervous system](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/23266-parasympathetic-nervous-system-psns)
    is the network of nerves that relaxes your body after periods of stress or danger.

    response that''s working towards lowering blood pressure," says Taylor-Piliae,
    whose research focuses on how mind-body interventions such as tai chi can benefit
    older adults with cardiovascular disease. "I think it''s the meditative quality
    of it."'

    blood pressure. The practice is appealing as a form of exercise because it is
    low impact and requires little space or equipment.

    membership, you don''t have to have special clothing," Taylor-Piliae says. "Once
