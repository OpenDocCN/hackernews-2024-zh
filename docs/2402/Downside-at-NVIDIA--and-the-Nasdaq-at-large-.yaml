- en: You don’t need to be an expert in semiconductors or A.I. to know that something
    is not quite right with the Nvidia valuation. As of yesterday’s market close,
    Nvidia was selling for a market cap of $1.5 trillion, up 420% since October 2022\.
    Trailing twelve months (TTM), Nvidia EPS (earnings per shares) was $7.58 and the
    share price now sits at $616\.
  prefs: []

    is “fair” — but is it really? Let’s have a look.

    times faster** than the bottom line. Prima facie, it doesn’t exactly look like

    AI startups for sure, and those startups use their VC-funded cash to buy GPUs

    current buzz, according to Moyroud at Lightspeed. He has seen an increasing number
    of founders mention generative AI in their pitches for funding — but he takes
    some of those pitches with a pinch of salt.

    behind some founders’ claims.
