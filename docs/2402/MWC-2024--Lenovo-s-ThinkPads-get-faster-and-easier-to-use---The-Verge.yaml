- en: While the [ThinkBook Transparent Display Laptop](/e/23846285) Lenovo showed
    off at MWC 2024 is just a proof of concept, the company also announced refreshed
    versions of several ThinkPads and ThinkBooks as well as a few accessories.

    5, ThinkPad T14s Gen 5, and ThinkPad T16 Gen 3, all with Intel Core Ultra processors
    (or an AMD Ryzen 8040 option for the T14 Gen 5). All three get Lenovo’s communication
    bar, which extends aportion of the top bezel to house the camera and microphones,giving
    those laptops slimmer top bezels and taller display ratios. Lenovo previously
    added this feature to other ThinkPad laptops, like the [X1 Carbon and X1 Nano](/2022/1/5/22868089/lenovo-thinkpad-x1-carbon-nano-yoga-laptops-ces-2022).'

    on the Fn, Insert, Enter, and volume keys as the ThinkPad X1 Carbon Gen 12 and
    ThinkPad X1 2-in-1 Gen 9 laptops to make typing more accessible to those who are
    visually impaired. Lenovo also broke with its long-standing tradition of putting
    the Fn key on the outermost edge and swapped it with Ctrl, where the majority
    of laptop and keyboard manufacturers put them. There’s [a physical Microsoft Copilot
    key](/2024/1/4/24023809/microsoft-copilot-key-keyboard-windows-laptops-pcs) between
    right Alt and Ctrl, too, but Lenovo left the Windows key alone. (Phew!)

- en: Lenovo also collaborated with [iFixit](https://www.ifixit.com/) to make it easier
    to replace certain hardware components on the ThinkPad T14 Gen 5 and T16 Gen 3\.
    This includes a move back to fully socketed DIMM slots instead of soldered RAM,
    user-replaceable cable-free batteries (with fewer screws to remove them), and
    accessible SSD and wireless adapter slots.

    marked, and Lenovo now includesQR codes inside the laptop body near each repairable
    component with instructional videos about the process. There are also indicators
    that point to the specific screws to remove if you’re looking to just replace
    the keyboard and trackpad.
