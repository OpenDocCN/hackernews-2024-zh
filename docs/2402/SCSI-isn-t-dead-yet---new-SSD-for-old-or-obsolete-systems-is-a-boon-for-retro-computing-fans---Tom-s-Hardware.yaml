- en: 'Solid State Disks Ltd (SSDL) has released a new storage product for industries
    and individuals that refuse to let go of their SCSI storage-based systems. The
    new [SCSIFlash-Fast](https://solidstatedisks.com/news/scsiflash-fast-protecting-and-enhancing-legacy-computing-systems/)
    is a 3.5-inch form factor drop-in replacement drive that can take the place of
    any ancient [68-pin](https://solidstatedisks.com/product/68-pin-lvd-scsi-fixed-disk-drive-3-5-single-cfast-ethernet/)
    or [80-pin](https://solidstatedisks.com/product/legacy-drive-emulators/80-pin-sca-scsi-fixed-disk-drive-3-5-single-cfast-ethernet/)
    connector SCSI HDD without the system even noticing. There are several touted
    benefits: friction-free hardware replacement, read/write speeds of up to 80 MB/s,
    reduced noise, reduced power consumption, a choice of [Compact Flash](https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/accelerated-compact-flash,1100.html)
    (CF) or [M.2 SSD](https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/best-ssds,3891.html) media,
    and an optional Ethernet port.'

    aficionados might still run old PC or Mac systems packing SCSI storage devices
    – just for fun. However, SSDL’s Sales & Marketing Director, James Hilken, points
    out that there are still systems used in aerospace, defense, manufacturing, medical,
    telecommunications, and other sectors “that were designed decades ago and were
    fitted with then state-of-the-art SCSI hard disk drives.” Hilken notes that many
    SCSI HDDs will be 20 years or older and, as well as being obsolete and irreplaceable
    like-for-like, these drives are “increasingly failing.”'

- en: SCSIFlash-Fast is configurable as a slick swap-in upgrade or replacement for
    that creaking SCSI drive you still rely on. SSDL says that buyers can configure
    to order so the newly purchased flash-based drive will “replicate the exact behavior
    of the SCSI HDD it replaces, meaning no modifications need to be made to the host
    system.” To this end, SCSIFlash-Fast can be set for SASI, SCSI-1, SCSI-2, or Ultra3
    host compatibility, and disk sector sizes of 256, 512, 768, 1,024, 2,048, or 4,096
    bytes.

    replacement. Hilken boasts that it is possible to swap out the [old HDD](https://www.tomshardware.com/features/hdd-benchmarks-hierarchy)
    and insert a new SCSIFlash-Fast “and the host system will not detect the difference.”
    Whatever configuration you decide upon, the new system should be quieter, less
    power-hungry, faster, and more reliable.

- en: Some other nice touches given to this product includes the depth of other SCSI
    configuration options that can be adjusted, as well as the device being firmware
    upgradable via USB. Last but not least, SSDL provides an optional Ethernet port
    that can be used for tasks like remote backups and reboots.

    of other SCSI-connected options such as [floppy disks](https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/storage/the-floppy-disk-refuses-to-die-in-japan-laws-that-forced-the-continued-use-of-floppies-have-finally-hit-the-chopping-block),
    magneto-opticals, [tape drives](https://www.tomshardware.com/news/tape-storage-soars-while-hdd-sales-crash),
    and HDDs – for 50, 68, and 80-pin SCSI connectors – with flash memory slots. Most
    also can be configured with Ethernet ports. Here you can see why the new SCSIFlash-Fast
    products got their ''Fast'' suffix: their 80 MB/s performance might sound puny
    compared to modern storage, but the other [SSDL SCSI to flash products](https://solidstatedisks.com/?s=scsi)
    we checked in the firm''s catalog are only capable of 10 MB/s.'
