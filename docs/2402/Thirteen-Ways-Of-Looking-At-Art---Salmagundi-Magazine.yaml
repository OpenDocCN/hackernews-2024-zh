- en: Art is useless, said Wilde. Art is for art’s sake—that is, for beauty’s sake.
    But why do we possess a sense of beauty to begin with? A question we will never
    answer. Perhaps it’s just a kind of superfluity of sexual attraction. Nature needs
    us to feel drawn to other human bodies, but evolution is imprecise. In order to
    go far enough, to make that feeling strong enough, it went too far. Others are
    powerfully lovely to us, but so, in a strangely different, strangely similar way,
    are flowers and sunsets. Art, in turn, this line of thought might go, is a response
    to natural beauty. Stunned by it, we seek to rival it, to reproduce it, to prolong
    it. Flowers fade, sunsets melt from moment to moment; the love of bodies brings
    us grief. Art abides. “When old age shall this generational waste, / Thou shalt
    remain.”

    it truth but meaning. Art points beyond itself. At what? At us. The role of art
    is to compile the endless atlas of human experience. It’s often not a pretty picture
    for, as Solzhenitsyn said, the line between good and evil runs through every human
    heart. Except it’s not a line; it’s a tangle. The gurus want to solve human nature;
    so do the utopians, the ideologues and revolutionaries. The artist, wiser, observes
    it, above all in herself. One answer to a question of the moment, is it ethical
    to engage with art by bad people, is: what other kind of people are there? If
    artists are heroic, it’s in this: that they are willing to confess the dirty human
    secrets that the rest of us can’t even bear to look at.'

    claim. They seek to yoke the artist to their plow. But the artist and the revolutionary,
    Baldwin said, “seem doomed to stand forever at an odd and rather uncomfortable
    angle to each other.” Both are visionaries, he continued, but their vision differs.
    Art may sometimes serve the cause of justice, but only ever indirectly. To improve
    the world (I will not say perfect or save, for these are illusions), you first
    have to know it. Art comes before politics, because truth comes before justice.

    —— 至多，为我们“挑战”或挑战“现状”，但始终在共识价值的四角之内。这种思维方式一直让我反感：其苍白、维多利亚时代的、一贯平淡的、一元教会阿姨式的公共善意浸泡。艺术对我们有益，就像锻炼、维生素以及饮食中充足的纤维一样，是一种身体政治的精神补品。正是这种刻板的重要性，王尔德正对其耍手段。然而，我难道不也有此罪过吗，以我自己的方式呢？

    times. So what’s the difference between that and “art is good for us”? If there
    is one, it is this. The whole modern idea—the liberal idea—is that the group isn’t
    all. The state, the clan, the tribe: that within these we carve out space for
    the individual (think of the Bill of Rights, as it dwells within the Constitution);
    that carving out space for the individual (“to secure these rights, Governments
    are instituted among Men”) is indeed the whole point of the thing. But that space
    is always under siege, mainly by people who think they know what’s good for us:
    by the church ladies or, now, the progressive commissars, who are really just
    militant church ladies. The point of art-for-bildung, as I understand it, is to
    help you to *become* an individual—a cussed, wayward, stubborn individual, with
    your own ideas and purposes—not to fit you to the group. Is it contradictory to
    try to use the setting of an institution, a university, to teach young people
    to be individuals? It is. It would be better not to have to. But that is what

    —— 自由理念 —— 认为群体并非全部。国家、家族、部落：在这些内部，我们开辟个体空间（想想《权利法案》，它在宪法中所居之地）；开辟个体空间（“为了保障这些权利，政府之间便有了许多官员”）确实就是事情的整个重点。但是这片空间总是受到围攻，主要是来自那些认为他们知道对我们有益的人：教会阿姨，或者现在的进步委员会，实际上只是激进的教会阿姨。在我理解中，艺术为了自我发展的目的是帮助你*成为*一个个体
    —— 一个倔强、任性、固执己见，拥有自己想法和目的的个体 —— 而不是让你适应群体。试图使用一个机构、一个大学的环境来教导年轻人成为个体，是否矛盾？是的。最好不要这样做。但这是我们目前的处境。

- en: Art is for connecting us, as individuals, outside the borders of the group.
    In a previous piece for these pages, I said that artists’ proper role, not even
    now but especially now, is to be un-political, trans-political, to remind us of
    everything in our experience that can’t be captured by the categories of the moment.
    Three weeks after sending in the piece, I came across a perfect example of what
    I was talking about. It was an essay by Meghan Daum, called “The Broken-In World,”
    about life after divorce, life in middle age, life in the wake of life’s inevitable
    fuck-ups and regrets. “[A]s your story joins the chorus of stories being told
    and listened to in as many versions as there are broken people to tell and hear
    them,” she writes, “you slide into a new kind of world.…It’s a world built on
    scar tissue, which turns out to be a surprisingly solid foundation. And at some
    point, without quite realizing it, your life goes from broken to *broken in*.”
    It is a piece about the beauty that lies on the other side of disfigurement, the
    honesty that lies on the other side of forty. And those are human things, two
    among a million, that don’t have anything to do with where you stand on the identity
    grid or the political spectrum.

- en: 'Art is for civilizing us. So says Dave Hickey in “A World Like Santa Barbara,”
    an essay every word and punctuation mark of which is relevant to our unhappy moment.
    Art, for him, lines up with urban life: with commerce, with difference. Uncivilized
    itself, a realm of turbulent energies, it is a way that we— “a diverse populace”
    living in a “tumultuous, heterogeneous” world—can negotiate difference and the
    anxieties it arouses. Art, we might say in his spirit—which welcomed art’s entanglement
    with the commercial—is itself like commerce, even like money, an instrument of
    mediation and negotiation. But “a culture that proposes the instantaneous alleviation
    of anxiety as its primary goal,” he says, is inimical to art and its civilizing
    function, which is not to eliminate anxiety but to teach us to enjoy and exploit
    it. His target here is “safety,” as a desideratum for children and others. His
    target is the church ladies: the normative, the therapeutic, the calmers and shushers.
    For with art, he says, we civilize *each other*, careless of authorities and institutions.
    One of Hickey’s favorite words was “pagan,” and another was “democracy.” We worship
    many gods in this republic—Barbie, Warhol, *Taxi Driver*, Taylor Swift—and we
    do so in freedom, pursuing our happiness, as equals. Cultural objects, he insisted,
    are occasions of “contentious civility,” a peaceful, ongoing, unsupervised debate
    about the terms of our collective life. What we have loved, others will love—or
    hate, or be left cold by, or just sort of like, but it is the argument that matters.'

  zh: 艺术的目的是使我们文明化。戴夫·希基在《像圣塔芭芭拉一样的世界》中说道，这篇文章的每一个词语和标点都与我们不快乐的时刻相关。对于他来说，艺术与城市生活一脉相承：与商业、与差异。本身不文明，充满动荡能量的领域，它是我们——“一个多样化的人群”生活在一个“混乱、异质化”的世界中——可以协商差异及其引发的焦虑的一种方式。我们可以说，在他欢迎艺术与商业纠缠的精神中，艺术本身就像商业，甚至像货币，是调解和协商的工具。但是他说，“一个以即时缓解焦虑为首要目标的文化”，是对艺术及其文明功能有害的，其功能不是消除焦虑，而是教会我们享受和利用它。他的目标是“安全”，作为儿童和其他人的向往。他的目标是教堂女士们：规范化的、治疗性的、镇静和安静的人。因为他说，通过艺术，我们使*彼此*文明化，无视权威和制度。希基最喜欢的词之一是“异教徒”，另一个是“民主”。在这个共和国中，我们敬拜许多神灵——芭比娃娃、沃霍尔、*出租车司机*、泰勒·斯威夫特——我们自由地追求自己的幸福，作为平等的人。他坚持认为，文化物品是“有争议的文明”，关于我们集体生活条款的和平、持续、无监督的辩论。我们所喜爱的，其他人也会喜爱——或者恨，或者被冷漠对待，或者仅仅是有点喜欢，但辩论是至关重要的。

    a Grand Unified Theory of art, one that would reconcile its various and sometimes

    say what art is for at all (those of us who do)? Because we feel we have to justify
    its existence: because it is so often accused, in this country, of being frivolous,
    merely ornamental, a luxury good; even more, because we want to see it funded
    and supported—by universities, philanthropies, the public. In other words, to
    look the matter in the face, we want other people to support the art we like,
    the art that can’t support itself because not enough people *do* like it: poetry;
    orchestral music; performance, conceptual, and social practice art; jazz, at this
    point; literary fiction, possibly soon. Which is pretty arrogant and pretty selfish.
    Plus—and here’s the point—it distorts the way we talk about what art is for. We
    bend our rhetoric, even our thinking, toward that which might appeal to funders,
    politicians, opinion makers. We say that art is good for us, or that it’s good
    for the local economy, or that it’s necessary for a healthy polity. But none of

    experiencing it involves. “Being in love,” Tim Kreider writes, “is one of the
    only times when life is anything like art,” but the reverse is also true. Art
    is one of the only times when life is anything like being in love. Attention,
    intensity. It is also one of the only times when waking life is anything like
    dreaming. I awaken from a dream, from its saturation of meaning and feeling, its
    world of color and complete fulfillment, its crowd of presences, of distant friends,
    old lovers, dead parents, to the drabness of quotidian life, to the narrowness
    of my existence, to my same old dismal self. Oh yeah, it’s me again. How can I

    Road* the other day. Somewhere between “You Never Give Me Your Money” and “Golden
    Slumbers,” I finally understood Nabokov’s definition of aesthetic bliss: “a sense
    of being somehow, somewhere, connected with other states of being where art (curiosity,
    tenderness, kindness, ecstasy) is the norm.” It is in this respect, and this one
    only, that art is utopian (and the reason that it gets dragooned for service to
    political utopias, which are a completely different kind of thing). Art connects
    us with another world, which has no place in ours. That world is, to use a term
    at which my reason recoils, the spirit world. Traditional societies did not feel
    the need to justify what we call art. Its purpose was obvious to them: to conjure
    spirits, to converse with divinity, to tap the source of being. Art is a fountain
    of spirit—that’s the closest I can come to it, though I’m thinking less of water
    than of magma. There is a crack, somewhere. Something flows, from somewhere. We
    gather around it; we build temples to it, which we call theaters and museums;
    we worship its earthly channels, whom we call geniuses; we talk about it endlessly.

  zh: 艺术的目的是增强生命。我相信，在所有其他目的得到应有的尊重之后，这才是它真正的意义——为什么我们崇敬它，为什么我们将心灵奉献给它。什么是增强生命？我们如何能活得更充实，考虑到我们不能活得更长？通过关注和强度。全身心地投入到世界中，毫无保留地感受：这是制作艺术作品所需要的，也是体验它所涉及的两件事。蒂姆·克莱德尔写道：“恋爱时，生活才像艺术”，但反之亦然。艺术是生活唯一一次像恋爱那样的时刻之一。关注，强度。它也是唯一一次醒着时生活像做梦一样的时刻。我从一个梦中醒来，从其中的意义和感觉的饱和度中醒来，从它的色彩世界和完全满足中醒来，从它的众多存在中醒来，从遥远的朋友、老情人、已故父母中醒来，回到平淡日常生活的灰暗中，回到我存在的狭窄中，回到我那同样黯淡的自我。哦，是的，我又回来了。我如何才能重获那片天堂，它刚刚在这里？只有通过艺术：通过音乐，通过故事，通过诗歌的炼金术。前几天我在听《阿比路》时。在“你从未给过我你的钱”和“金色梦境”之间，我终于理解了纳博科夫对美学极乐的定义：“一种与其他存在状态（好奇心、温柔、仁慈、狂喜）某种联系的感觉。”就这一点而言，艺术是乌托邦的（也是它被征用为政治乌托邦服务的原因，尽管那完全是另一回事）。艺术连接我们与另一个世界，这个世界在我们的世界中找不到位置。那个世界，用我理性厌恶的术语来说，是灵界。传统社会不觉得有必要为我们所谓的艺术辩护。它的目的对他们来说是显而易见的：召唤灵魂，与神性对话，触及生命之源。艺术是灵魂的泉源——这是我能想到的最接近它的描述，尽管我所想的不是水，而是岩浆。某处有一道裂缝。某种东西从某处流出。我们聚集在它周围；我们建造称为剧院和博物馆的神庙；我们崇拜它的世俗渠道，称之为天才；我们无休止地谈论它。我们甚至可以假设我们存在的目的是艺术。
