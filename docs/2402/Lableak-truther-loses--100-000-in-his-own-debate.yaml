    his odds of a lab leak have also increased to 99.8% as well, which is beyond ridiculous.

    with “counter-evidence”; meaning that because the Huanan market evidence leans
    zoonosis, he can take the FCS evidence (which leans lab leak for him) and just
    “cancel” them out against each other so they would not influence his probabilistic
    inference calculation. Absurd.

    I liked this comment because I think it is correct. When somebody is as captured
    by a false belief as Saar Wilf, they unfortunately become **an easy mark for bad
    actors** and **bad reasoning** that poisons their understanding of reality. Saar
    showed this by inviting the conspiracy theorist and well-known DRASTIC member
    Yuri Deigin to argue his case for the second debate about genetics. Yuri and I
    have of course a bit of a history, with me getting tired of his amateurish BS
    and motivated cherry-picking; so of course he gets an honorary mention.
