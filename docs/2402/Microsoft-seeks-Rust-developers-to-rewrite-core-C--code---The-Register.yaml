    to the previous year – recruitment persists at the Windows giant. In this case,
    the company is forming a team of Rustaceans to tackle a platform move away from
    C#.

    spotted by [MSPowerUser](https://mspoweruser.com/microsoft-forms-new-team-to-help-rewrite-core-windows-components-into-rust-from-c-c/),
    the job lurks within the Substrate App Platform group, part of the Microsoft 365
    Core Platform organization. The Substrate does the heavy lifting behind the scenes
    for Microsoft's cloud services, making a rewrite into Rust quite a statement of
    intent.

    OS security for Windows [announced](https://www.theregister.com/2023/04/27/microsoft_windows_rust/)
    the arrival of Rust in the Windows kernel and the language has been making its
    way into multiple components over the years.

    the Rust Foundation. Considering the growing enthusiasm for [memory-safe programming](https://www.theregister.com/2023/01/26/memory_safety_mainstream/),
    something Rust delivers with far less effort than the likes of C++, Microsoft's
    move is unsurprising. However, the company's desire to shift existing C#-based
    services to Rust will raise a few eyebrows among the developer community.

    after [proudly proclaiming](https://www.theregister.com/2018/06/18/microsoft_roundup/)
    that Office 365 was being ported to JavaScript. In this instance, while Microsoft
    remains committed to C#, at least in public, its actions over the last few years
    and the job posting are indications that the company is keeping its options open.
