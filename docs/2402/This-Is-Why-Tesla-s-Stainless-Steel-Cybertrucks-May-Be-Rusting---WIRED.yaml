- en: Tesla says it uses proprietary stainless steel (possibly from Outokumpu of Finland,
    Europe's largest producer, which runs a plant in Calvert, Alabama). However, even
    proprietary stainless steels can stain, especially if any cheaper steel fittings
    beneath the Cybertruck's panels react with the stainless product.

    of "stainless steel": austenitic, ferritic, martensitic, duplex, and precipitation
    hardened. Some containing chromium among other constituents, such as nickel and
    molybdenum, are more corrosion-resistant than others, forming an impervious and
    protective molecular-scale surface barrier of chromium oxide.'

    have bought the SUV, including when washing it is advised not to use hot water
    or clean the electric truck in direct sunlight.

- en: Stainless steel discoloration usually takes the form of small, dark brown pits
    on the steel's surface. Exposure to sea salt and high temperatures can be one
    cause of such pitting. Some parts of California, a hot state with a 1,264-mile
    coastline, might, therefore, be worse than others for causing the orange flecks
    reported by Raxar and others.

- en: Once the chromium oxide barrier is breached, corrosion takes hold. And caveat
    emptor, because Tesla's owner's manual advises promptly removing corrosive substances,
    emphasizing not to wait until the Cybertruck is scheduled for a "complete wash,"
    whatever that is.

- en: 'The documentation says: “To prevent damage to the exterior, immediately remove
    corrosive substances (such as grease, oil, bird droppings, tree resin, dead insects,
    tar spots, road salt, industrial fallout, etc.). Do not wait until Cybertruck
    is due for a complete wash. If necessary use denatured alcohol to remove tar spots
    and stubborn grease stains, then immediately wash the area with water and a mild,
    non-detergent soap to remove the alcohol.”'

    car owner—but tree sap and bugs? Maybe that $5,000 Cybertruck wrap should ship
    as standard.

    at 23 minutes in—reveal how delicately Cybertruck owners need to treat their stainless
    steel electric SUVs. The washing stipulations alone include, somewhat amazingly,
    “Do not wash in direct sunlight,” “Some cleaners and car shampoos contain chemicals
    that can cause damage or discoloration,” and even “Do not use hot water.”
