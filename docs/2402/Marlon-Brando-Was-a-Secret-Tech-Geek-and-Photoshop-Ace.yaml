- en: Though the late star was considered by many to be the greatest actor of the
    20th century, Brando always had a love-hate relationship with his craft, often
    remarking that it was a [silly profession for a grown adult](http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2005/03/brando200503).
    He was so frustrated by acting that, in the late 1980s, he embraced a new technology
    that promised to keep him on the big screen while simultaneously lightening his
    workload.

- en: In the new documentary *Listen to Me Marlon*, director Stevan Riley stitches
    together intimate home footage that the actor took over the years and combines
    it with rare interviews to portray Brando as a complicated and volatile soul.
    But the actor still had a spark for life before his death at age 80 in 2004, and
    he was fascinated with visual effects, as you can see in this exclusive clip above
    from the documentary, which you can watch above. The footage was originally intended
    for an experimental film called *Software*, which Brando tried to make in the
    1990s — more on that later — and features Brando, then in his seventies, delivering
    a monologue from *Macbeth*, his face rendered in blue pixels.

- en: The technology in the clip, known as “digital equivalence,” involves creating
    a photo-realistic digital double of an actor that can look, move, and sound just
    like the original. It had long been a holy grail of the computer-graphics industry,
    and when Brando found out about its potential, he partnered with Scott Billups,
    a veteran cinematographer and graphics pioneer, in the pursuit of perfecting the
    technology.

    the footage to the new doc, told Yahoo Movies. “He was always upgraded. He had
    some new Macs before I did — and I was a Mac developer.”

- en: The two met in the mid 1970s, but didn’t begin working together in earnest until
    the late 1980s, when Billups was conducting digital experiments with an actor
    who lived near Brando’s Hollywood estate (Billups declined to identify the thespian
    by name). While that neighbor was unnerved by the idea of creating a digital double,
    Brando eagerly volunteered to be the next test-subject.

    put us out of business, but the test models worked, and you knew who was [on screen].
    So Marlon was like, ‘I’m next, I’m next,’” Billups said. They worked closely with
    Stephen and Lloyd Addleman, brothers who [invented an early version of the 3D
    scanner hardware](https://books.google.com/books?id=xlP1uoxU1nEC&pg=PA14&lpg=PA14&dq=Stephen+and+Lloyd+Addleman+cyberware&source=bl&ots=gEmbqlYhVv&sig=f10haQ9tsaT8n3H14OQnqaXdfUY&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CDMQ6AEwBGoVChMI0YHO2tnYxgIViowNCh3jmgSw#v=onepage&q=Stephen%20and%20Lloyd%20Addleman%20cyberware&f=false),
    which Billups likened to an advanced supermarket grocery scanner and a spinning
    chair.

- en: “The concept was for [the actor] to sit in this chair and get really still,
    and the scanner would go around you in 360 degrees [in] just under a minute,”
    Billups explained. “Sometimes the scanner would freeze up, so we’d spin the chair.
    You put somebody like Marlon in a chair and try to get an even spin on him — well,
    he’s really not the kind of guy who likes to sit still for long.”

- en: Billups and Brando wound up doing four different tests of the technology throughout
    the late ‘80s and early ‘90s; one such test focused on replacing the actor in
    a film he probably shouldn’t have made anyway. “He was doing *Island of Doctor
    Moreau*,” Billups remembered, “and he said he could do half of that script digitally.”

    but the digital equivalence tests did lead to the duo working on an even more
    off-beat project: An adaptation of Rudy Rucker’s [Philip K. Dick Award-winning
    cyberpunk novel *Software*](http://www.amazon.com/Software-Rudy-Rucker/dp/0380701774),
    on which Billups and Brando began pre-production in 1997.'

    a motion capture studio where they hosted Brando’s A-list friends, including Faye
    Dunaway. (Dennis Hopper was also attached to the film early on.) “We were scanning
    them and doing mo-cap — we were going to do this whole movie with digital equivalents,”
    Billups said. “You could do a movie with a week’s worth of work instead of sitting
    on set bored out of their minds for a couple months.”

    producers and financiers; it was awfully expensive to attempt to make a film with
    such an ambitious and risky technology.

    of some of the early tests that Billups and Brando did together; the actor was
    required to speak — with exaggerated expression —every vowel and syllable, so
    that they could later generate a fully digital character that made the same exact
    facial movements. The result is found in the video at the top of this story.

    as the new century dawned, he pursued not just high-grade experimental electronics,
    but consumer-level tech, as well.

    Billups explained. “He was an ace with Photoshop. He would take people’s pictures
    and put them in places they never were. He’d say, ‘Remember when we were in so-and-so?’
    and you’d see people trying to remember that situation.”

- en: The trick to successfully confusing his friends, Billups explained, was being
    subtle about it. “He would maneuver it so wasn’t totally unbelievable; he would
    create an alternate reality,” Billups remembered. “He’d say, ‘I’ve got a picture
    of it right here, you’re looking at a picture of you at the Statue of Liberty.’
    He would do this to all kinds of people, it was hilarious.”

- en: Brando invested heavily in his hardware, always going after the latest computer
    systems — often owning them before Billups, who still makes his living in the
    visual effects industry. The actor was even an early user of CoSa After Effects,
    the post-production program used for green screen and other effects work, which
    was eventually sold to Adobe.

- en: Billups remembers Brando first talking about potentially using motion capture
    and digital equivalence to perform his role as Jor-El in the original *Superman*
    movie, which came out in 1978\. It’s taken almost 40 years for effects artists
    and engineers to realize the technology he was pursuing; this summer, audiences
    will see aged-down versions of Arnold Schwarzenegger and Michael Douglas in *Terminator
    Genisys* and *Ant-Man*, respectively. The tech isn’t perfect yet, but the facial
    scan used in those two blockbusters is a tremendous leap forward from where it
    was when Brando died in 2004.

    to imagine the actor being enamored with social media. Brando was a fan of the
    *Myst* PC game franchise, and was active in early forms of social media.

    of his skin,” Billups recalled. “His online persona was that of Chinese exchange
    student and he handled it masterfully. Not in any skeezy way, but he could pull
    things out of people that might not have realized of themselves. He was quite
    masterful at this.”
