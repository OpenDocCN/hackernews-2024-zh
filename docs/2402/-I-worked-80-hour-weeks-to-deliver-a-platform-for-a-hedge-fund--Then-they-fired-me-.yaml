- en: I joined the startup hedge fund last year. In the short period while I worked
    there, I built an order management system which allowed the firm to make its first
    eve trades. A typical week for me included working between 70 and 80 hours a week.
    I worked almost every weekend, and almost every day for the entire time, without
    a single day of holiday.

- en: I did this for two reasons. Firstly, I was told repeatedly that the faster the
    firm was able to start trading, the faster I would start earning bonuses from
    the firm's PnL, assuming that the strategies indeed were profitable. (It is my
    understanding that they are highly profitable.)

- en: After months of hard work, the system finally went into production, and trades
    started flowing around the system. Two days later I was let go. I arrived in the
    office the morning after 48 hours of profit making, and was called into a private
    office. I was told it was “with regret” that my contract would be terminated that
    day, and that the “substantial bonus” which would be paid to me was “thanks” for
    the critical role I played in starting the company.

- en: While I in no way regret working for the fund, as I gained a fast amount of
    experience in a relatively short period of time, I do regret not being more tactical
    with my work. I could have simply worked 40 hours a week. Had I done so, it is
    likely I would still be employed, still building the platform today.

- en: Since the day I left, I have been relentlessly job searching. But so far I have

    applications either received an automatic rejection, or simply no response in
