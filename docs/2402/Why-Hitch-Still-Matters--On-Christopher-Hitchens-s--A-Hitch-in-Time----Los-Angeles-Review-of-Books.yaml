    late for many. Already in the Clinton ’90s, Hitchens noted that we had entered
    the postmodern politics of the “lesser evil”: “Politics as a spectator sport,
    staged by fixers in a parallel universe […] Extreme public squalor and tribalism,
    coexisting with a triumph of special interests not seen since the Gilded Age.

    as irretrievably as a well-formed consensus that functions like embalming fluid
    […] Even in death he remains uncontainable.” Less an apologia for the hawk in
    Hitchens 2.0 than a ballast, the essays here encourage us to resist the lure of
