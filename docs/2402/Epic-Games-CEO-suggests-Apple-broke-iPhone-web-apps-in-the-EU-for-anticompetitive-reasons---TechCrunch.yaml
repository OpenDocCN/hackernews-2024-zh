    in the EU due to its [compliance](https://techcrunch.com/2024/01/25/apple-dma-changes/)
    with the EU regulation the Digital Markets Act (DMA), Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney
    [suggests in a post on X](https://twitter.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1758267492781199501)
    there’s another reason behind Apple’s decision: iPhone web apps don’t make Apple
    money. Sweeney, whose company [sued Apple over antitrust concerns](https://techcrunch.com/2024/01/16/supreme-court-declines-to-hear-apple-epic-antitrust-case-meaning-developers-can-point-customers-to-the-web/)
    related to App Store fees, is obviously a biased source on the matter, but he
    raises a question that’s on everyone’s minds. Did Apple break iPhone web apps
    because it was looking to protect customers from security risks arising from third-party
    browser engines, as it claims, or was the decision more about quashing a potential
    threat to Apple’s business?'

- en: The iPhone maker on Thursday published an update to its [website detailing its
    DMA-related changes in the EU](https://developer.apple.com/support/dma-and-apps-in-the-eu/)
    to address the matter, after the discovery that iPhone web apps — also known as
    progressive web apps, or PWAs — were no longer functional in the recent iOS betas
    in the EU. Initially, there was concern that the issues were just a beta bug,
    but Apple soon put that theory to rest.

- en: On its website, [Apple explains](https://developer.apple.com/support/dma-and-apps-in-the-eu/)
    that to comply with the DMA, it’s being forced to support other web browser engines
    besides WebKit — the browser engine used by Safari. iOS Home Screen web apps have
    relied on WebKit and its security architecture to keep users safe from online
    threats. This involves the isolation of storage and the enforcement of “system
    prompts to access privacy-impacting capabilities,” Apple said.

- en: Without this isolation and enforcement, malicious web apps could read data from
    other apps and gain access to a user’s camera, microphone or location with user
    consent, the company noted. Since Apple is being forced to allow alternative browser
    engines via the DMA’s requirements, the company chose not to put users at risk
    and instead degraded the web app experience on iOS for users in the EU. Now, web
    apps will function as website bookmarks — without support for local storage, badges,
    notifications and dedicated windowing.

  zh: 该公司指出，如果没有这种隔离和执行，恶意Web应用程序可能会读取其他应用程序的数据，并获得用户摄像头、麦克风或位置访问权限。由于苹果被迫允许通过DMA的要求使用替代浏览器引擎，该公司选择不让用户面临风险，而是在欧盟地区降低了iOS上的Web应用程序体验。现在，Web应用程序将仅作为网站书签运行，不支持本地存储、徽章、通知和专用窗口。
- en: Though Sweeney arguably has a bone to pick with Apple, there may be some truth
    to his claims. Within Apple’s explanation of why it has ended support for web
    apps in the EU, the company admits there’s a technical solution to the security
    issues problem — but it simply chose not to implement it.

- en: Addressing the complex security and privacy concerns associated with web apps
    using alternative browser engines **would require building an entirely new integration
    architecture** that does not currently exist in iOS and was not practical to undertake
    given the other demands of the DMA and the very low user adoption of Home Screen
    web apps.

    Screen Web应用程序的用户采纳率极低。
- en: In short, Apple is saying it knows how to fix the problem but because it’s been
    burdened by having to comply with the DMA — which it noted had required “more
    than 600 new APIs and a wide range of developer tools” — it decided to skip fixing
    this one.

  zh: 简而言之，苹果表示它知道如何解决问题，但由于必须遵守DMA（它指出需要“超过600个新API和各种开发者工具”），它决定跳过修复这个问题。
- en: While it may be no small feat to build “an entirely new integration architecture,”
    it also isn’t as if Apple was surprised by the DMA, a [regulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Markets_Act)
    that’s been in the works for years. It had time to prepare for this. To further
    deflect any culpability here, Apple suggests that people won’t mind that it broke
    Home Screen web apps, given their “low user adoption.”

  zh: 尽管构建“一种全新的集成架构”可能并非易事，但苹果并不意味着对DMA感到惊讶，这项[法规](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Markets_Act)已经酝酿多年。它有时间为此做准备。为了进一步转移责任，苹果表示，考虑到“Home
    Screen Web应用程序”的用户采纳率低，人们不会介意它破坏了这一点。
- en: But Apple’s own moves contradict that explanation. If anything, Apple has been
    working to make PWAs more useful over the years, adding [features](https://love2dev.com/blog/apple-ships-service-workers/)
    that allowed web apps to function more like native apps, and be easily distributed
    outside its App Store. Meanwhile, user adoption has been growing, not shrinking.
    Analysts estimated that the PWA market [would reach $10.44 billion by 2027](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/02/08/2171664/0/en/Progressive-Web-Application-Market-Size-to-Reach-USD-10-44-Billion-by-2027-Global-Analysis-Statistics-Revenue-Industry-Demand-and-Trend-Analysis-Research-Report-by-Emergen-Research.html),
    at a compound annual growth rate of 31.9%.

  zh: 但苹果公司自己的举动与这一解释相矛盾。如果说有什么变化的话，苹果多年来一直在努力使PWA变得更加实用，添加了[功能](https://love2dev.com/blog/apple-ships-service-workers/)，使Web应用程序能够更像本地应用程序，并且可以在其App
    Store之外轻松分发。与此同时，用户采纳率一直在增长，而非减少。分析师估计，PWA市场到2027年将达到104.4亿美元，年复合增长率为31.9%。
- en: It’s entirely possible that alternative browser engines could make PWAs even
    more useful, as Sweeney argues, which would be a threat to Apple’s App Store business,
    given the web apps are now nearly as functional as native apps are.
