    in the EU due to its [compliance](https://techcrunch.com/2024/01/25/apple-dma-changes/)
    with the EU regulation the Digital Markets Act (DMA), Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney
    [suggests in a post on X](https://twitter.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1758267492781199501)
    there’s another reason behind Apple’s decision: iPhone web apps don’t make Apple
    money. Sweeney, whose company [sued Apple over antitrust concerns](https://techcrunch.com/2024/01/16/supreme-court-declines-to-hear-apple-epic-antitrust-case-meaning-developers-can-point-customers-to-the-web/)
    related to App Store fees, is obviously a biased source on the matter, but he
    raises a question that’s on everyone’s minds. Did Apple break iPhone web apps
    because it was looking to protect customers from security risks arising from third-party
    browser engines, as it claims, or was the decision more about quashing a potential
    threat to Apple’s business?'

- en: The iPhone maker on Thursday published an update to its [website detailing its
    DMA-related changes in the EU](https://developer.apple.com/support/dma-and-apps-in-the-eu/)
    to address the matter, after the discovery that iPhone web apps — also known as
    progressive web apps, or PWAs — were no longer functional in the recent iOS betas
    in the EU. Initially, there was concern that the issues were just a beta bug,
    but Apple soon put that theory to rest.

- en: On its website, [Apple explains](https://developer.apple.com/support/dma-and-apps-in-the-eu/)
    that to comply with the DMA, it’s being forced to support other web browser engines
    besides WebKit — the browser engine used by Safari. iOS Home Screen web apps have
    relied on WebKit and its security architecture to keep users safe from online
    threats. This involves the isolation of storage and the enforcement of “system
    prompts to access privacy-impacting capabilities,” Apple said.

- en: Without this isolation and enforcement, malicious web apps could read data from
    other apps and gain access to a user’s camera, microphone or location with user
    consent, the company noted. Since Apple is being forced to allow alternative browser
    engines via the DMA’s requirements, the company chose not to put users at risk
    and instead degraded the web app experience on iOS for users in the EU. Now, web
    apps will function as website bookmarks — without support for local storage, badges,
    notifications and dedicated windowing.

    to his claims. Within Apple’s explanation of why it has ended support for web
    apps in the EU, the company admits there’s a technical solution to the security
    issues problem — but it simply chose not to implement it.

    using alternative browser engines **would require building an entirely new integration
    architecture** that does not currently exist in iOS and was not practical to undertake
    given the other demands of the DMA and the very low user adoption of Home Screen
    web apps.

    burdened by having to comply with the DMA — which it noted had required “more
    than 600 new APIs and a wide range of developer tools” — it decided to skip fixing
    this one.

    it also isn’t as if Apple was surprised by the DMA, a [regulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Markets_Act)
    that’s been in the works for years. It had time to prepare for this. To further
    deflect any culpability here, Apple suggests that people won’t mind that it broke
    Home Screen web apps, given their “low user adoption.”

    working to make PWAs more useful over the years, adding [features](https://love2dev.com/blog/apple-ships-service-workers/)
    that allowed web apps to function more like native apps, and be easily distributed
    outside its App Store. Meanwhile, user adoption has been growing, not shrinking.
    Analysts estimated that the PWA market [would reach $10.44 billion by 2027](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/02/08/2171664/0/en/Progressive-Web-Application-Market-Size-to-Reach-USD-10-44-Billion-by-2027-Global-Analysis-Statistics-Revenue-Industry-Demand-and-Trend-Analysis-Research-Report-by-Emergen-Research.html),
    at a compound annual growth rate of 31.9%.

    more useful, as Sweeney argues, which would be a threat to Apple’s App Store business,
    given the web apps are now nearly as functional as native apps are.
