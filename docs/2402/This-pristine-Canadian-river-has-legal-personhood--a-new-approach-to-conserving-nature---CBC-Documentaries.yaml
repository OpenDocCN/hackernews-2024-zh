    to water, which tumbles down nearly 300 kilometres across the rocky landscape,

    common sight in Canada or around the world. According to the documentary, less
    than a third of the planet's large rivers remain free-flowing from source to sea.
    Due to their strength, these bodies of water hold the potential for hydro power.

    before it empties into the St. Lawrence, power companies like Hydro-Québec have
    long wanted to dam the Magpie further to harness its power. In recent years, the
    spring melt has seen the river rise by more than 30 metres in places, pushing
    950 cubic metres of water per second through certain points.

    parallel to a highway of portage trails leading up from the St. Lawrence River.
    In 2009, it was dammed by Hydro-Québec to create four hydroelectric power stations.
    Intermittent flooding dramatically changes the landscape around the dams, wreaking
    havoc on animal habitat and disrupting natural corridors that animals use to move
    through their territory.

    Cárdenas, president of the International Observatory on the Rights of Nature,

    it''s not an object to exploit, but a person to protect," Cárdenas says in the
    documentary. This approach to conservation falls under the legal framework of
    the rights of nature, which recognizes that natural phenomena, like rivers and
    forests, have the intrinsic right to exist outside of their relationship to humans.'

    right to water, Cárdenas told the CBC. "If we destroy nature, we are undermining
    our individual and collective capacity to prosper and live in relationship with
    our environment … when we affect the environment, we affect ourselves."

    it can draw questions about how the Magpie will manage the intricacies of the

    the Magpie would likely not be found liable. "The river doesn't commit intentional

    in known flood zones are also aware of the risks.
