  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: All things emerge, change, and die. I think *Quality* is the experience of the
    process. The idea of *Good Quality* essentially boils down to performing the process
    with grace, and leaving the place better than we found it.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Further, the process of emergence and change—i.e. living—is also the process
    of dying. It follows that to think clearly about the Quality of the former one
    must think clearly about the Quality of the latter. The saddest way it can unfold
    is a slow painful degradation without healing succour meaning or hope. The proverbial
    death by a thousand cuts. I hope you never witness such a passing, even from afar.

    of software products.

    but remaining the same in purpose, interface, and behaviour. Many Unix tools fall
    in this category. Some projects like ZeroMQ make it their explicit goal. Many
    Clojure programmers value such "finished-ness". Such scattered examples exist.

    because the world it must serve changes indefinitely. The Emacs editor is a software
    product that has evolved non-stop for *nearly half a century* since it emerged
    in 1976, and it continues to thrive. This post was written in Emacs.

- en: There is a strong reinforcing feedback loop too. Software changes the world
    fast, forcing software to change faster. The current reincarnation of Machine
    Learning and AI can be viewed as an expression of this process. We're basically
    saying it's all accelerating so much that it is getting humanly *impossible* to
    write and revise software fast enough, to out-OODA the pace of change. So we must
    instead find algorithms that sense the world and then dynamically generate or
    revise other algorithms to achieve system objectives (viz. alter the world further
    in our favour).

    the thousand cuts metaphor applies. That any of the above scenarios were likely
    the product of corner-cuts, often near-invisible to the naked eye in the moment.
    Corner-cuts that added up—nay, *compounded*—over time; slowly as band-aids, then
    as stitches and casts, and then suddenly as gangrene. And maybe the whole thing
    died of those cuts, or continued as a barely alive entity until someone had the

  prefs: []

- en: Our death-by-cuts risk profile will look the same, if the workflow is strictly
    linear as depicted above. It doesn't matter if we do it slowly in big batches
    over months, or faster as smaller batches over days. Small linearised batches
    may even worsen the aggregate risk profile, such as when market feedback loops
    are delayed or discontinuous. The smaller the batch, the more likely it is that
    feedback about several batches ago gets to us now. Such delayed feedback tends
    to severely disrupt strictly linear flows.

    about systems (a longer conversation, for another day). We can make a small start

    performing all kinds of deep surgery on the *organisation* that produces it. The
    whole thing—product and org—is *simultaneously* flexed, reconfigured, and even
    totally redesigned in-place with rapidity that is very uncommon in other industries.
    Why? Because software fundamentally is peoples' thoughts being played on repeat.
