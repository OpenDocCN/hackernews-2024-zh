- en: It has been an open secret in the cryptography community that Hal Finney was
    the designer of BitCoin from the very start. Hal died in 2014\. Or at least he
    was frozen in liquid nitrogen so not talking either way.

- en: Besides being the first person to be involved in BTC who didn't hide behind
    a pseudonym, Hal published a paper that describes essentially the whole BitCoin
    scheme two years before BTC was launched. And Hal never once accused Satoshi of
    stealing his work.

- en: 'The reason Hal had to hide behind Satoshi is simple: The Harber Stornetta patent
    didn''t expire until about 9 months after BTC launched. That covers the notion
    of the hash chain. There is absolutely no way anyone working in the field did
    not know about that patent or its imminent expiry. Hal certainly did because I
    discussed it with him before BTC was launched.'

    to have free and clear title? Well, Hal got his terminal ALS diagnosis a few weeks
    prior: He was a man in a hurry.'

    of the patent term to avoid a lawsuit over the rights to BTC from Surety. He died
    before that happened.

    the bit bucket. The key fingerprint is probably the hash of some English language
    phrase.
