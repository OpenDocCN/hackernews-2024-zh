- en: Journalist and author Séamas O’Reilly has said he finds it “very, very funny”
    that his account on X, formerly Twitter, was suspended just hours after he posted
    about an article he wrote for the Irish Examiner in which he said the platform
    was unusable due to bots.

- en: The author’s account had over 100,000 followers and was around 14 years old,
    he said. Having gone through his posts from Saturday, which is when the account
    was suspended, he has come to the conclusion that the post that caused the suspension
    was to do with his article on bots.

    behemoth, operated by the world’s most famous man, has suspended an Irish journalist
    for making those points in an Irish newspaper,” O’Reilly said.

    riveting and important global news in and of itself; I’m not that arrogant. But
    I do think it is a pretty hilarious bit of overreach from the guy who is a self-proclaimed
    free speech absolutist. So I do think it is quite noteworthy and quite surreal,
    to be honest.”

- en: O’Reilly appealed the first notification he got to say his account was suspended
    immediately. The suspension cited platform manipulation and spam as its reasoning,
    which he wrote in his appeal that he had nothing to do with.

    10th, “around midday, and then five hours later I was banned,” he said.

    blue check mark, meaning that, unlike me, it pays money every month to Elon Musk’s
    vastly indebted and unprofitable platform, a situation which would greatly disincentive
    his company taking proactive measures to weed them out”.

- en: O’Reilly said if he did not get his account back it would be “personally, quite
    annoying but professionally quite depressing” as Twitter was his route into his
    current profession as a journalist and author. He used it as a “shop front” in
    ways, he said.

    for me... But it’s really at the point where it doesn’t really work in practical
    terms. It is not as useful as an object as it used to be. It incentivises lots
    of extremely negative and hateful speech and has really made that a big kind of
    calling card of its business for the last year or two... that you can go on there
    and say anything.”
