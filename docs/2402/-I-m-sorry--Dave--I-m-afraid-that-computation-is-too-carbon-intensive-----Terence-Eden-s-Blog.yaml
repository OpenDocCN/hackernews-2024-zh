    API empowers app developers to optimize app behavior, minimizing environmental
    impact by shifting background tasks to times when more renewable energy is available
    in the local electrical grid.

    batch computing meant that programmers could use "spare" CPU cycles at night.
    Their code ran when no-one else was using the machine. These days, it is common
    for computational tasks to be outsourced to where-ever electricity is least polluting.
    For example, shifting overnight processing to countries on the other side of the
    planet with excess solar power. With Windows' new APIs, they can wait until [electricity
    is too cheap to meter](https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2023/12/electricity-thats-too-cheap-to-meter/)
    before doing something computationally expensive.

    it is fascinating that we might soon routinely add CO[2] to that equation.

    use](https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2017/11/what-if-your-internet-connected-fridge-came-with-free-electricity/).
    It would be brilliant if your freezer knew to wait 10 minutes for less-polluting
    power before running its compressor. Similarly, you could tell a clothes dryer
    to be finished by the time you get home - but let it decide when to actually run.

    processing to the cloud, when domestic electricity becomes too expensive.

    it will cause harm? Is there an interpretation of the [laws of robotics](https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2019/01/i-robot-the-3-laws-considered-harmful/)
    which prevents a machine from polluting?

    future. But I am curious what incentives - financial or otherwise - there might
    be to encourage more efficient resource use.
