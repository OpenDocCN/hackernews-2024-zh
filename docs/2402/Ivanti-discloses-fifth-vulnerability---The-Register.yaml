    pro-China or state-sponsored by Beijing.

  zh: 在一月中旬，首次有[报告](https://www.theregister.com/2024/01/11/china_backed_ivanti_exploits/)称，攻击者（要么支持中国，要么由北京政府资助）正在利用Ivanti产品的两个零日漏洞。
- en: Since then, Ivanti has continued to work on developing patches in accordance
    with its staggered schedule, which is to say it's developing patches for the versions
    with the most users, and working down from there. In the meantime, it released
    a mitigation to keep people safe while they wait for patches.
  id: totrans-split-23

  zh: 自那时起，Ivanti继续按照其分阶段计划开发补丁，即为用户最多的版本开发补丁，并逐步向下工作。同时，它发布了一项缓解措施，以确保人们在等待补丁时的安全性。

    weren't so serious, was that in fixing the first two zero-days, [it found another
    two vulnerabilities](https://www.theregister.com/2024/01/31/ivanti_patches_zero_days/),
    one of which was also exploited as a zero-day.

  zh: 在发布第一个补丁的同时，令人哭笑不得的是，它修复了首两个零日漏洞，[发现了另外两个漏洞](https://www.theregister.com/2024/01/31/ivanti_patches_zero_days/)，其中一个也被作为零日漏洞利用。
- en: Better yet, Ivanti also said attackers had devised workarounds for the mitigation
    it provided, so it was forced to make a new one and this is still working to the
    best of our knowledge.

  zh: 更好的是，Ivanti还表示攻击者已经为其提供的缓解措施设计了解决方法，因此被迫制定了一个新的缓解措施，据我们所知，这仍在运行中。

- en: The zero-days were under "mass exploitation" status [within days](https://www.theregister.com/2024/01/16/ivanti_zeroday_exploits_explode_into/),
    since proof of concept (PoC) code was published before Ivanti could develop patches.

- en: Underlining the severity of the situation, CISA issued its [second emergency
    directive](https://www.theregister.com/2024/02/05/ivanti_zero_day/) last week
    instructing federal agencies to disconnect the products entirely. This followed
    an initial advisory adding the first two zero-days to its "must-patch" list the
    same day Ivanti disclosed them.

  zh: 突显情况严重性，CISA上周发布了其[第二紧急指令](https://www.theregister.com/2024/02/05/ivanti_zero_day/)，指示联邦机构完全断开与该产品的连接。这是在Ivanti披露首两个零日漏洞的当天发布的初始建议后进行的。
