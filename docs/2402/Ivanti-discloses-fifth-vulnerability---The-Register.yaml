    of CVE-2024-22024 – the latest in a series of vulnerabilities affecting Ivanti
    gateways as the vendor continues to develop patches for supported versions.

    been [disputed](https://twitter.com/GossiTheDog/status/1755949758160523570).

    pro-China or state-sponsored by Beijing.

    with its staggered schedule, which is to say it's developing patches for the versions
    with the most users, and working down from there. In the meantime, it released
    a mitigation to keep people safe while they wait for patches.

    weren't so serious, was that in fixing the first two zero-days, [it found another
    two vulnerabilities](https://www.theregister.com/2024/01/31/ivanti_patches_zero_days/),
    one of which was also exploited as a zero-day.

    it provided, so it was forced to make a new one and this is still working to the
    best of our knowledge.

    an initial advisory adding the first two zero-days to its "must-patch" list the
    same day Ivanti disclosed them.
