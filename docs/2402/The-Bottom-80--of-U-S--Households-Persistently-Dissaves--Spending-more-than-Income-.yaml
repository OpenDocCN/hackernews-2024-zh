    a pretty eye-popping economic reality that’s been invisible in the national accounts…forever.
    Subtract households’ Personal Taxes and Personal Outlays from Personal Income
    to yield Personal Saving, and it turns out that the bulk of U.S. households don’t
    save. Quite the contrary: the bottom 80% spends more than its income, year in
    and year out. Only the top 20% consistently saves.'

    Income Accounts (here, the “DPIAs”), first released in December 2020 and now in
    its fourth (greatly improved) prototype version, released December 2023\. It provides
    breakdowns of Personal Income and Personal Taxes by income deciles — top 10%,
    next 10%, etc. — currently for twenty-two years 2000 through 2021. The situation
    revealed in this post was simply invisible before the DPIAs were released.

    from disposable income, and you’ve got Personal Saving for that quintile group.
    Divide *that* by disposable income, and you get the standard-issue Personal Saving
    Rate.

    decades, without running out of assets to spend? Spending *[is](http://blah.blah)*
    transferring assets to firms (mostly), in exchange for newly-produced goods and
    services. If you don’t have assets, you can’t spend.

- en: The answer lies in the first footnote here. Personal Income isn’t the only source
    of household assets. The two big missing pieces are holding (capital) gains on
    assets, and borrowing (which adds both assets and liabilities, in equal amounts,
    to household balance sheets). Adding these two additional measures does shift
    most bottom quintiles from spending deficits to asset surpluses in most years.

    to keep spending (it is, some), overwhelmingly it’s holding gains that “fund”
    the perennial dissaving of the bottom 80%.
