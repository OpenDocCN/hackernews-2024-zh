- en: Yesterday, we gave away our ~6-year-old GE French-door refrigerator after a
    never-ending slog of repairs. At least the guy and his mother who came to pick
    it up have a side-hustle of repairing and reselling appliances. There's hope it
    won't end up in a landfill. He offered to sell me a 4-door Samsung. No Thanks!
    I'm done with over-complicated appliances. Refrigerator repair is not a skill
    I'm looking to hone any further.

  zh: 昨天，我们送走了我们约6年的 GE 法式门冰箱，它经历了无休止的维修煎熬。至少那位来取货的人和他的母亲有修理和转售家电的副业。希望它不会最终成为填埋场的垃圾。他提议我买一台4门
    Samsung。不用了！我对过于复杂的家电已经厌倦了。冰箱维修不是我想要进一步磨练的技能。

- en: I have a refrigerator in my garage that's a side-by-side style Kenmore (Model#
    25354362402). The sticker on the inside indicates a manufacture date of `06-04`.
    It was bought as a scratch-and-dent model from Sears Outlet. At some point, over
    a decade ago, the relay on the compressor went out. The fix was cheap and easy.
    Later, we started having problems with the ice maker / dispenser. Instead of fixing
    it, we decided to get a new one and use the side-by-side as a second refrigerator
    in the garage. Since then, it's out-lived two French-door refrigerators we have
    had in the intervening time.

  zh: 我的车库里有一台 Kenmore 侧-by-侧款式的冰箱（型号# 25354362402）。里面的标签显示制造日期是 `06-04`。它是从 Sears
    Outlet 买的划痕/凹痕模型。十多年前，压缩机上的继电器坏了。修理很便宜而且容易。后来，我们开始遇到冰机/分配器的问题。我们决定不修理它，而是购买了一台新的，将侧-by-侧冰箱作为车库的第二个冰箱使用。自那时起，它比我们之间用过的两台法式门冰箱都更长寿。

    gets clogged. Cleaning the rubber hose and dust off the condenser is a yearly
    chore at least. It becomes the reason to take all the food out and fully clean
    everything. Otherwise, get ready to spend hours defrosting. One hack we found
    to speed it up was to pour nearly boiling water down the drain to defrost the
    ice build up.

    water button on its own. Basically, the person I got the part from on ebay lied
    saying that it was brand new. It was refurbished. We could tell because there
    had been some soldering work done to the board. Instead of uninstalling it and
    returning it, we realized that button pressing over and over wasn't affecting
    any functionality (we don't use its hot water dispenser anyway). We just turned
    the sound off to stop the annoying repeated chiming noise.
