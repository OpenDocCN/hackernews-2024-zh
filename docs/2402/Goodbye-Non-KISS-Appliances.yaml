- en: Yesterday, we gave away our ~6-year-old GE French-door refrigerator after a
    never-ending slog of repairs. At least the guy and his mother who came to pick
    it up have a side-hustle of repairing and reselling appliances. There's hope it
    won't end up in a landfill. He offered to sell me a 4-door Samsung. No Thanks!
    I'm done with over-complicated appliances. Refrigerator repair is not a skill
    I'm looking to hone any further.

- en: I have a refrigerator in my garage that's a side-by-side style Kenmore (Model#
    25354362402). The sticker on the inside indicates a manufacture date of `06-04`.
    It was bought as a scratch-and-dent model from Sears Outlet. At some point, over
    a decade ago, the relay on the compressor went out. The fix was cheap and easy.
    Later, we started having problems with the ice maker / dispenser. Instead of fixing
    it, we decided to get a new one and use the side-by-side as a second refrigerator
    in the garage. Since then, it's out-lived two French-door refrigerators we have
    had in the intervening time.

    buy an extended warranty on it. Fast-forward past 6-10 (I forget) repairs / replacements
    of the same part and much hassle, they gave me store credit as though I bought
    it new without dents. The amount, I forget, but ended up being a curse because
    we felt compelled to use it all on an even fancier French-door refrigerator this
    time brand new.

    another French-door refrigerator. I even remember thinking about the [KISS principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle)
    at the time, but somehow thought switching brands and spending 3x the amount would
    save us from the complexity.

    failed in 2022\. When that happens, the fridge compartment doesn't cool well.

- en: Ice builds up in the bottom of the freezer if the drain to the evaporation pan
    gets clogged. Cleaning the rubber hose and dust off the condenser is a yearly
    chore at least. It becomes the reason to take all the food out and fully clean
    everything. Otherwise, get ready to spend hours defrosting. One hack we found
    to speed it up was to pour nearly boiling water down the drain to defrost the
    ice build up.

- en: Once the freezer stopped cooling, and we noticed the case was hot to the touch
    on the side between the freezer and fridge compartments. This ended up being due
    to a failed condenser fan. A real PITA to replace, by-the-way.

    can view error codes and run all sorts of tests via the LCD touch screen. Then
    I found out that the touch screen wasn't working. Since a new touch screen LCD
    assembly is over $300, so I ordered one off ebay instead.

- en: We had a problem with the "new" LCD assembly intermittently pressing the hot
    water button on its own. Basically, the person I got the part from on ebay lied
    saying that it was brand new. It was refurbished. We could tell because there
    had been some soldering work done to the board. Instead of uninstalling it and
    returning it, we realized that button pressing over and over wasn't affecting
    any functionality (we don't use its hot water dispenser anyway). We just turned
    the sound off to stop the annoying repeated chiming noise.

    I was able to test the capacitor on the relay was good, but the relay was bad.
    Replaced the relay, but the compressor still is not starting. Tested that it is
    getting 120VAC.

    out with an air compressor and replaced on `2021-06-05`, the $74 fan can't reach
    RPM? It was working and has nothing to do with the compressor not running, but
    it's hard to justify spending more money to fix this thing with the non-stop fan
    issues.

    engine and hybrid cars are surprisingly reliable. And perhaps, for the right price,
    there are brands that have pulled it off with complex refrigerators. There's just
    not enough value added by any of the fancy features to warrant the potential headache.
