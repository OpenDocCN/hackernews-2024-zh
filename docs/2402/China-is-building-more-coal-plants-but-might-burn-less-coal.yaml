    doesn’t make much economic sense. Energy analysts see it as the symptom of poor
    planning; decisions that will lead to underused power plants and stranded assets.

    – or will peak in the next few years. We’ll have to wait and see if they’re right.
    But the fact that they can even *suggest* that a peak in coal use is coming, while
    China is adding more coal plants, seems contradictory.

    less coal. It just has to run them less often. Based on data over the last decade
    or two, that’s exactly what’s happening.

    quantities of solar and wind, which are essentially free to run once they’re installed.
    As renewables push down the cost of energy, coal will become less and less profitable.

    provides plants with a source of income even when they’re not being used. Some
    project that by the end of the decade many coal plants will be making more money
    from *not running* than actually producing power. This seems credible if we look
    at the tumbling capacity factors expected from S&P over the next few decades.

    now has a program mandating “flexibility retrofits” on coal plants so that they
    can ramp up and down more effectively. If coal was going to maintain its role
    as the bulk baseload of the energy system, it wouldn’t need to do this.

    That might lead them to overbuild ‘just in case’. Last year China’s hydropower
    output [saw a big drop](https://ember-climate.org/insights/research/global-electricity-mid-year-insights-2023/)
    due to devastating droughts. It was mostly coal power that was used to cover the

    level. Plants used to be centrally approved until 2014, when those decisions were
    passed down to each province. The problem is that each province operates as if
    it’s in a bubble – it wants to secure consistent and reliable supplies on its
    own, without relying on its neighbours for any shortfall. That’s an incredibly
    inefficient way to plan large-scale energy systems, and it means every province
    becomes overly conservative about its demands.
  prefs: []

- en: Provincial leaders are also judged on the economic growth figures within their
    administration. Approving and building coal plants – regardless of whether they’re
    needed – can lead to economic activity which looks good on their short-term scorecard
    but leads to chronic oversupply in the long term.

    The trends are pointing in that direction. If it continues to build low-carbon
    energy as quickly as it has over the last few years, it seems likely that solar
    and wind will cover all of its new demand.
  prefs: []

    a big surge in industrial output and ramp up its coal plants. Seems unlikely,
    but not impossible.

    go down while its installed capacity goes up. That’s a paradox that I think most
    people aren’t aware of. They see China building new plants and assume that its
    emissions will keep rising.
