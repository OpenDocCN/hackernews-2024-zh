    that came from X during Super Bowl weekend, from Friday, Feb. 9 up until the end
    of Super Bowl Sunday on Feb. 11\. The data was collected from across CHEQ's 15,000
    total clients. It's a small portion of the relevant data, and it's not scientifically
    sampled, but it nonetheless suggests a dramatic trend.

    ad fraud for its clients. Tytunovich's company accomplishes this by tracking how
    visitors from different sources, such as X, interact with a client's page after
    they click one of their links. The company can also tell when a bot is passing
    itself off as a real user, such as when a fraudulent user is faking what type
    of operating system they are using to view a website.

    in seemingly inauthentic activity in recent months. When a post goes viral on
    X, its now commonplace to find bots filling the replies with AI-generated responses
    or accounts with randomly generated usernames spamming a user's mentions with
    unsolicited "link-in-bio" promotions. Now, there's data which backs up that user
    experience.

    in [*The Guardian*](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/feb/15/x-paid-post-promotion-advertising
    "(opens in a new window)"), Gene Marks, a small business owner shared his ad campaign
    results from X. After a small $50 advertising spend, X's analytics shows that
    his website had received 350 clicks from approximately 29,000 views. However,
    according to Google Analytics, X wasn't the source of any of the actual traffic
    his website had received during that time period.

    [being fake] is a bit opportunistic."'

    the same time period, the bot issue on Musk's platform appears even more stark.
    CHEQ also provided data to Mashable pertaining to Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok.
    In terms of fake traffic, no other platform came close to X's nearly 76 percent.

    January 2024\. TikTok, Facebook, and Instagram all had very similar stats to each
    platform's respective Super Bowl weekend numbers. Slightly more than 2.8 percent
    of the 306 million visits sent from TikTok were determined to be fake. Out of
    the 90 million visits that came from Facebook, a bit more than 2 percent were
    fake. And Instagram's traffic was only 0.96 percent fake, based on 749,000 visits.

    the bot problem, stressed to Mashable that his company cannot tell how many fake
    users are on social media platforms themselves. The data only details how many
    bots came to CHEQ's clients' sites from those platforms.

    Tytunovich demonstrated by providing Mashable with data from last year's Super
    Bowl. During the comparable weekend in February 2023, fake traffic from the platform
    then-known as Twitter only accounted for 2.81 percent out of 159,000 visits. That's
    around 72 percent less than this year's game.

    platform in late October of 2022\. And a lot has changed on X between last February
    and today under Musk's leadership. The platform was still known as Twitter then.
    Notable users still had their [legacy verified blue checkmarks](https://mashable.com/article/twitter-blue-check-verified-removal-internet-reactions).

    proliferating on X, as well as [antisemitic comments](https://mashable.com/article/apple-suspends-x-twitter-advertising-elon-musk-antisemitic-conspiracy)

    real human beings. Advertisers typically pay social media companies based on impressions
    and/or clicks on their advertisements. And based on this traffic data, advertisers
    could potentially be paying Musk and company for visits from an audience consisting
    mostly of bots.
