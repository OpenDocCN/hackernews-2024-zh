    its new [Vision Pro](Apple-Vision-Pro-weight-has-been-revealed-and-is-almost-as-heavy-as-a-12-9-inch-iPad-Pro.794956.0.html)
    headset. While Apple has had a long-standing policy of not allowing apps with
    pornographic content on its iPhones and iPads, it has never made any attempts
    to block users from accessing content of their choice on their devices through
    the web. Of course, it has even less control - as things currently stand - on
    its Macs, which, like other PCs, permit users to install their own apps and view
    whatever content they choose and in whatever way.

- en: While Vision Pro users aren’t blocked from viewing porn using Safari per se,
    Apple has blocked the ability to view porn in immersive VR mode, a function that
    has not been blocked on other VR headsets from other makers. This means the Vision
    Pro is the world’s first "spatial computer" that cannot play spatial porn. Users
    can still view regular porn on a “flat” screen, but this is likely to leave connoisseurs
    of immersive porn feeling deflated – in more ways than one.

- en: One workaround for Apple aficionados is to get themselves a cheap [Google Cardboard](Google-Cardboard-open-sourced-as-a-lifeline-for-mobile-VR.441427.0.html)
    or similar old-school mobile phone VR viewer, and use their iPhones like the early
    days of VR porn. However, the high visual fidelity of a Vision Pro would have
    undoubtedly made it a next-level experience. Historically, the porn industry has
    been a key driver of the mainstream adoption of new technologies, however, it
    seems Apple is prepared to cede that part of the market to other headset makers.

- en: '**Update:** Vision Pro users can enable immersive web content - including VR
    porn - however, Apple has made the process [quite convoluted](https://x.com/michaelgold/status/1753640496709185985?s=20)
    with 9 steps required to activate the WebXR API in Safari for Vision Pro. Apple
    currently considers the feature "experimental", which - especially for a AR/VR
    headset with limited content at launch - seems something of an unusual oversight.
    This suggests that it could become enabled by default in future, but there isn''t
    a public timeline for when this might happen. It is also conceivable that Apple
    may leave the feature obscured as it is indefinitely given its "family-friendly"
    public image.'

- en: I have been writing about consumer technology over the past ten years, previously
    with the former MacNN and Electronista, and now Notebookcheck since 2017\. My
    first computer was an Apple ][c and this sparked a passion for Apple, but also
    technology in general. In the past decade, I’ve become increasingly platform agnostic
    and love to get my hands on and explore as much technology as I can get my hand
    on. Whether it is Windows, Mac, iOS, Android, Linux, Nintendo, Xbox, or PlayStation,
    each has plenty to offer and has given me great joy exploring them all. I was
    drawn to writing about tech because I love learning about the latest devices and
    also sharing whatever insights my experience can bring to the site and its readership.
