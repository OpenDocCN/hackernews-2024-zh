    I’ve learned a thing or two — about mistakes I make over and over, about what
    I like and why, and what I would do differently given the chance to start again.

    I am, here’s the advice I’d give.

- en: A manufacturer’s ethos could align with yours in all kinds of ways. Smooth nibs
    or feedbacky? Wet or dry? Piston or C/C? Big or small? Designed to post or not?
    Generally, the same kinds of design decisions are made right across the portfolio,
    so if you don’t get on with one pen from a brand, you probably won’t get on with
    the rest, either. That was a big ‘aha’ moment for me, although it sounds stupid.

- en: Probably the best example in my case was Pilot. Over the years I’ve had a 912,
    a 91, another 91, a 92, a Myu, an 823 and another 823, a Vanishing Point, a Fermo,
    and now a vintage Vanishing Point. Oh, and a Prera that I bought for my partner.
    If I’m honest with myself, the only one that I really got on with was the 912,
    with its FA nib, and the Fermo’s F in a close second. The 823 left me cold. Pretty
    much every Pilot nib I’ve used has been (to me) a dry writer, and the pens generally
    feel clinical and not particularly comfortable — although I know that other people
    love them, and I appreciate the quality and consistency of what Pilot produces.
  prefs: []

    earlier, I’d have saved myself a lot of money — money that I could have spent
    on Viscontis and Montblancs, which speak to me much more.

    and rounded opinion on a topic just from the sheer volume of information you read
    about a pen or ink on the internet. I’ve bought (or avoided) plenty of pens and
    inks simply based on reviews by other bloggers.
  prefs: []

    to agree with each other. When the enthusiastically reviewed ink arrives, we condition
    ourselves to feel positive about it ourselves. It’s very difficult to take a step
    back and build our own opinion of a product, but it’s important to do so.'

    823\. Everyone loves the 823\. When I didn’t get on with it the first time, I
    figured that the problem was me, and actually bought a second!

    community is so rabid that I really had to stop and think before I realised that
    the pen wasn’t for me. I was close to feeling that I was wrong, that the product
    was great and I just had to get used to it. That simply wasn’t true for me.

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This is the hardest lesson to learn when your inbox and Instagram feed is bombarded
    with the latest and greatest. Manufacturers have honed their limited-edition marketing
    to a fine art, and I’m often hit with severe FOMO anxiety as a result. I’ve figured
    out that this is not healthy for me. I need to take a deep breath and figure out
    whether I just want to be one of the lucky few to score, or if that new limited
    edition will really make my enjoyment that much greater.
  prefs: []

    I discussed in point 2, and the lack of knowledge of which brands suit you that
    I discussed in point 1 — you have a recipe for disaster. I STILL find myself clicking
    on the latest Sailor Pro Gear limited edition, even though I have had first-hand
    experience with Sailor and know that they’re not right for me!

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Some of my favourite pens have started out their relationship with me by giving
    me a terrible writing experience. They’ve arrived with duff nibs from the manufacturer,
    and that’s soured my opinion of the whole pen.
  prefs: []

- en: 'I’ve written at length before about my feelings on this topic — I wish manufacturers
    would be better at QC, and retailers too. BUT: I’ve tried to mellow a little and
    realise that bad nibs happen to good pens, and the situation can be salvaged.
    Often the fix takes a matter of minutes, and even if you can’t sort it out with
    a brass shim and some micromesh, a good retailer will make a nib swap a painless
    affair.'

    a new ink, you might be unhappy with your first experience. Try a different ink
    in that new pen! Or, try that new ink in a different nib! See if that makes the
    experience any better.

    and inks against that paper — it simplifies things for me, because I know how
    that paper behaves. But it does mean that when I’m trying out pens in stores or
    at pen shows, the experience won’t be the same as at home.

    I’ve ever bought. Luckily, I learned to keep the boxes fairly early on — which
    helps resale price, and makes shipping easier. What I should have done earlier
    on is put them up in the loft in a container, instead of having them filling up
    my home office!

    each other. I use safe inks, and flush pens that are sat unused for long periods.
    All of this means I can be confident that, when I sell a pen, it’s in good condition.

    new things will stick. Which means we have a vibrant second-hand economy, on Instagram
    (shout out to @virtualpenshow), on Facebook, on FPN and FPgeeks, and a thousand
    other places (yes, even eBay). When you’re looking for a new fix, don’t go straight
    to the shops — dive in to that second-hand economy. I’ve bought dozens and dozens
    of pens from other pen addicts, and I can hardly think of an instance when I’ve
    had a problem. Buying used naturally saves you some money, gives you access to
    models you can no longer buy new, and helps other community members out.

    we deal with on a daily basis are hardly multinational giants. But every industry
    benefits from innovation and diversity, as well as heritage, and I’ve watched

    Omas and Delta — go under.

    proud to buy from Leonardo, Scribo and Onoto, as well as the smaller specialist
    retailers facing Amazon’s pressure, and the craft makers of notebooks and accessories
    (like Nock) that cater to our specialist needs. I avoid buying from Amazon, and
    I make an effort to share my positive experiences with the community to help small
    businesses grow.

    up three drawers in my office. Although I’ve probably spent over £2,000 on them
    in total, they’re not worth very much individually, and they’re fragile, heavy
    and therefore costly to ship — which means I will struggle to sell them. They’re
    all 90% full and are in perfectly good order, and most of them are nice inks,
    so I don’t want to just throw them away. But even if I stop buying ink today,
    it will take me my whole life to use them up.
  prefs: []

    up on me. Inks are cheap, there are millions of them out there, and individually

    small, but my real problem is my ink hoard.

    challenge my own assumptions, manage my habits, and understand how my preferences
    are evolving.

    which pens I had inked, and for how long; how often I used each one. That kind
    of data is impossible to piece together after the fact. And it might make it a
    lot less painful to sell a pen if I could look back through my records and prove
    to myself that I hadn’t written with it in 18 months.
