    or feedbacky? Wet or dry? Piston or C/C? Big or small? Designed to post or not?
    Generally, the same kinds of design decisions are made right across the portfolio,
    so if you don’t get on with one pen from a brand, you probably won’t get on with
    the rest, either. That was a big ‘aha’ moment for me, although it sounds stupid.

    a 91, another 91, a 92, a Myu, an 823 and another 823, a Vanishing Point, a Fermo,
    and now a vintage Vanishing Point. Oh, and a Prera that I bought for my partner.
    If I’m honest with myself, the only one that I really got on with was the 912,
    with its FA nib, and the Fermo’s F in a close second. The 823 left me cold. Pretty
    much every Pilot nib I’ve used has been (to me) a dry writer, and the pens generally
    feel clinical and not particularly comfortable — although I know that other people
    love them, and I appreciate the quality and consistency of what Pilot produces.
