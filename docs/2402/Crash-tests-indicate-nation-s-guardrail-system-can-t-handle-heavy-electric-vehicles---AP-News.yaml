- en: LINCOLN, Neb. (AP) — Electric vehicles that typically weigh more than gasoline-powered
    cars can easily crash through steel highway guardrails that are not designed to
    withstand the extra force, raising concerns about the nation’s roadside safety
    system, according to crash test data released Wednesday by the University of Nebraska.

- en: Electric vehicles typically weigh 20% to 50% more than gas-powered vehicles
    thanks to batteries that can weigh almost as much as a small gas-powered car.
    And they have lower centers of gravity. Because of these differences, guardrails
    can do little to stop electric vehicles from pushing through barriers typically
    made of steel.

    as an electric-powered pickup truck hurtled toward a guardrail installed on the
    facility’s testing ground on the edge of the local municipal airport. The nearly
    4-ton (3.6 metric ton) 2022 Rivian R1T tore through the metal guardrail and hardly
    slowed until hitting a concrete barrier yards away on the other side.

    system,” said Cody Stolle with the facility. “The system was not made to handle
    vehicles greater than 5,000 pounds.”

- en: The university released the results of the crash test at a time when the rising
    popularity of electric vehicles has led transportation officials to sound the
    alarm over the weight disparity of the new battery-powered vehicles and lighter
    gas-powered ones. Last year, the National Transportation Safety Board [expressed
    concern](https://apnews.com/article/technology-road-safety-national-transportation-board-automotive-accidents-dd5c4260f68e9f5dcb430a02cc939f6b)
    about the safety risks heavy electric vehicles pose if they collide with lighter
    vehicles.

    appear to offer superior protection to their occupants, even if they might prove
    dangerous to occupants of lighter vehicles. The Rivian truck tested in Nebraska
    showed almost no damage to the cab’s interior after slamming into the concrete
    barrier, Stolle said. In response to the release of the test results Wednesday,
    Rivian Automotive Inc. noted that the truck used in the testing received a 2023
    Top Safety Pick+ award, the highest tier award issued by the Insurance Institute
    for Highway Safety.

    of roadway, is to help keep passenger vehicles from leaving the road, said Michael
    Brooks, executive director of the nonprofit Center for Auto Safety. Guardrails
    are intended to keep cars from careening off the road at critical areas, such
    as over bridges and waterways, near the edges of cliffs and ravines and over rocky
    terrain, where injury and death in an off-the-road crash are much more likely.

    what you’re seeing here is the real concern with EVs — their weight. There are
    a lot of new vehicles in this larger-size range coming out in that 7,000-pound
    range. And that’s a concern.”

    and Development Center also involved a Tesla sedan crash, in which the sedan lifted
    the guardrail and passed under it. The tests showed the barrier system is likely
    to be overmatched by heavier electric vehicles, officials said.

    to achieve a travel range of about 300 miles (480 kilometers) per charge.

    vehicles, is planned, he said, and will be needed to determine how to engineer
    roadside barriers that minimize the effects of crashes for both lighter gas-powered
    vehicles and heavier electric vehicles.

    we have some time,” Stolle said. “But as EVs continue to be sold and become more
    popular, this will become a more prevalent problem. There is some urgency to address
    this.”

    buying light-weight pickups and sport utility vehicles, the Midwest Roadside Safety
    Facility found that the then-50-year-old guardrail system was proving inadequate
    to handle their extra weight. So, it went about redesigning guardrails to adapt.

    are heavier than their gas-powered counterparts. Successive generations are likely
    to be lighter, he said, as manufacturers work to make smaller batteries that carry

    tires and infrastructure like parking garages.
