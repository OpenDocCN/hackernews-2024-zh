- en: LINCOLN, Neb. (AP) — Electric vehicles that typically weigh more than gasoline-powered
    cars can easily crash through steel highway guardrails that are not designed to
    withstand the extra force, raising concerns about the nation’s roadside safety
    system, according to crash test data released Wednesday by the University of Nebraska.

  zh: 内布拉斯加州林肯（美联社）— 根据内布拉斯加大学周三发布的撞击测试数据显示，电动车通常比汽油车重，可以轻松撞穿未设计用于承受额外力量的钢铁公路护栏，引发对国家路边安全系统的担忧。
- en: Electric vehicles typically weigh 20% to 50% more than gas-powered vehicles
    thanks to batteries that can weigh almost as much as a small gas-powered car.
    And they have lower centers of gravity. Because of these differences, guardrails
    can do little to stop electric vehicles from pushing through barriers typically
    made of steel.

    as an electric-powered pickup truck hurtled toward a guardrail installed on the
    facility’s testing ground on the edge of the local municipal airport. The nearly
    4-ton (3.6 metric ton) 2022 Rivian R1T tore through the metal guardrail and hardly
    slowed until hitting a concrete barrier yards away on the other side.

  zh: 该大学发布了撞击测试结果，此时电动车日益流行，已经引发了交通官员对新型电池动力车辆与较轻的汽油动力车辆之间重量差异的警示。去年，国家交通安全委员会[表达了关切](https://apnews.com/article/technology-road-safety-national-transportation-board-automotive-accidents-dd5c4260f68e9f5dcb430a02cc939f6b)，即如果重型电动车与较轻的车辆碰撞，可能会带来安全风险。
- en: Road safety officials and organizations say the electric vehicles themselves
    appear to offer superior protection to their occupants, even if they might prove
    dangerous to occupants of lighter vehicles. The Rivian truck tested in Nebraska
    showed almost no damage to the cab’s interior after slamming into the concrete
    barrier, Stolle said. In response to the release of the test results Wednesday,
    Rivian Automotive Inc. noted that the truck used in the testing received a 2023
    Top Safety Pick+ award, the highest tier award issued by the Insurance Institute
    for Highway Safety.

    卡车撞击混凝土隔离墙后，车厢内几乎没有损坏。作为对周三发布的测试结果的回应，Rivian 汽车公司指出，在测试中使用的卡车获得了2023年最高级别的安全选择+奖，这是由美国公路安全保险协会颁发的最高奖项之一。
- en: But the entire purpose of guardrails, found along tens of thousands of miles
    of roadway, is to help keep passenger vehicles from leaving the road, said Michael
    Brooks, executive director of the nonprofit Center for Auto Safety. Guardrails
    are intended to keep cars from careening off the road at critical areas, such
    as over bridges and waterways, near the edges of cliffs and ravines and over rocky
    terrain, where injury and death in an off-the-road crash are much more likely.

  zh: 但非营利机构汽车安全中心执行主任迈克尔·布鲁克斯说，沿着数万英里的公路发现的整体护栏的目的是帮助防止乘客车辆离开道路。护栏旨在防止车辆在关键区域（如桥梁和水域附近、悬崖和峡谷边缘以及岩石地形上）离开道路，避免在道路外撞击时造成伤亡。
- en: “Guardrails are kind of a safety feature of last resort,” Brooks said. “I think
    what you’re seeing here is the real concern with EVs — their weight. There are
    a lot of new vehicles in this larger-size range coming out in that 7,000-pound
    range. And that’s a concern.”

- en: The preliminary crash test sponsored by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers’ Research
    and Development Center also involved a Tesla sedan crash, in which the sedan lifted
    the guardrail and passed under it. The tests showed the barrier system is likely
    to be overmatched by heavier electric vehicles, officials said.

    buying light-weight pickups and sport utility vehicles, the Midwest Roadside Safety
    Facility found that the then-50-year-old guardrail system was proving inadequate
    to handle their extra weight. So, it went about redesigning guardrails to adapt.

  zh: 这个设施之前也遇到过这个问题。在上世纪九十年代，随着越来越多人购买轻型皮卡和运动型多用途车辆，中西部路边安全设施发现当时已有50年历史的护栏系统不足以承受它们的额外重量。因此，他们重新设计了护栏以适应新的情况。
