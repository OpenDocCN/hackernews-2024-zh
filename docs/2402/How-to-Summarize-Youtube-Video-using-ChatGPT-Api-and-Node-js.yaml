    in Node.js that starting from a youtube video link generates a summary using OpenAI's
    [completions api](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/text-generation/chat-completions-api),
    the same api on which the ChatGPT system is based.

    options. This decision is motivated by the fact that implementing everything independently
    incurs no costs associated with third-party APIs for text extraction. Additionally,
    as a genuine enthusiast, I prefer this approach, given that most of my personal
    projects are founded on this technique.

- en: After getting the captions, we put them into OpenAI. The first challenge I faced
    was the limit on the maximum size of the text that the completions API can handle.
    This limit depends on the model used; for the 3.5 turbo model, it's specifically
    set at 4.000 tokens.
  id: totrans-split-18
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To overcome this limitation, I adopted a recursive approach. The text is divided
    into smaller parts, which are merged into groups and summarized independently;
    this process is repeated until a single output text is generated, corresponding
    to the final summary generated from the intermediate summaries.

    into a single text. It is worth noting that we specified a maximum of 200 words
    in the prompt. With 5 pieces, we should have a maximum of 1000 words. However,
    in experimenting, I have noticed that these limits specified in the OpenAI prompt
    are often not met. As a result, I opted for lower thresholds to ensure proper
    operation without running into errors due to too large context.
