    The same thing that I consider to be a feature is a bug in most applications.
    We’ve already seen examples of lawyers who use ChatGPT to create legal documents,
    and the AI just fabricated past cases and precedents that seemed completely plausible.
    When you think about the idea of trying to make use of these models in education,
    this becomes a bug too. What they do is generate sentences that sound like correct
