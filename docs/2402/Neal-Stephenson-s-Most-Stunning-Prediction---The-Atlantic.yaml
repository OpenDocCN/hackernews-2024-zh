    as all that fictional. Speculative novels have an impressive track record at prophesying
    what innovations are to come, and how they might upend the world: H. G. Wells
    wrote about an atomic bomb [decades](https://thebulletin.org/virtual-tour/h-g-wells-novel-the-world-set-free-predicts-atomic-warfare/)

    age than Neal Stephenson. His novels coined the term [*metaverse*](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2021/10/facebook-metaverse-name-change/620449/),
    laid the conceptual groundwork for cryptocurrency, and imagined a geoengineered
    planet. And nearly three decades before the release of ChatGPT, he presaged the
    current AI revolution. A core element of one of his early novels, [*The Diamond
    Age: Or, a Young Lady’s Illustrated Primer*](https://bookshop.org/p/books/the-diamond-age-or-a-young-lady-s-illustrated-primer-neal-stephenson/8466804?ean=9780553380965),
    is a magical book that acts as a personal tutor and mentor for a young girl, adapting
    to her learning style—in essence, it is a personalized and ultra-advanced chatbot.
    The titular Primer speaks aloud in the voice of a live actor, known as a “ractor”—evoking
    how today’s generative AI, like many digital technologies, is highly dependent
    on humans’ creative labor.'

    digital communication, in which tiny computers with immense capabilities are embedded
    in everyday life. Corporations are dominant, news and ads are targeted, and screens
    are omnipresent. It’s a world of stark class and cultural divisions (the novel
    follows a powerful aristocratic sect that styles itself as the “neo-Victorians”),
    but it’s nevertheless one in which the Primer is presented as the best of what
    technology can be.

    Primer. “A chatbot is not an oracle,” he told me over Zoom last Friday. “It’s
    a statistics engine that creates sentences that sound accurate.” I spoke with
    Stephenson about his uncannily prescient book and the generative-AI revolution
    that has seemingly begun.

    that was designed to suspend over the crib. It had very primitive, simple shapes
    on it because, when they’re newborns, their visual systems can’t resolve fine
    details. So there would be a square and a triangle and a circle. And then, after
    a certain number of days or weeks had gone by, you were supposed to pop those
    cards off of the mobile and snap on a different set that had a more appropriate
    fit for what their brains were capable of at that age. That just got me to thinking:
    *What if you extended that idea to every other form of intellectual growth?*'

    was talking to people who were working on some of the underlying technologies
    that would be needed to communicate on the internet in a secure, anonymous manner.
    I guess it’s implicit that there’s an AI in there that’s generating the story
    and increasing the degree of sophistication in response to the learning curve
    of the child, but I didn’t really go into that very much; I just kind of assumed
    it would be there.

    of today that resembles or could one day become like the Primer?'

    in video games. I found it rewarding and fascinating because of the hallucinations:
    I could see how new patterns emerged from the soup of inputs being fed to it.
    The same thing that I consider to be a feature is a bug in most applications.
    We’ve already seen examples of lawyers who use ChatGPT to create legal documents,
    and the AI just fabricated past cases and precedents that seemed completely plausible.
    When you think about the idea of trying to make use of these models in education,
    this becomes a bug too. What they do is generate sentences that sound like correct
    sentences, but there’s no underlying brain that can actually discern whether those
    sentences are correct or not.'

    Pythagorean theorem. There must be thousands of old and new explanations of the
    Pythagorean theorem online. The real thing we need is to understand each child’s
    learning style so we can immediately connect them to the one out of those thousands
    that is the best fit for how they learn. That to me sounds like an AI kind of
    project, but it’s a different kind of AI application from DALL-E or large language
    models.

    words in a sequence, are being applied to many areas where they have no specialized
    abilities—GPT-4 for medical diagnosis, Google Bard as a tutor. That reminds me
    of a term used in the book instead of *artificial intelligence*, *pseudo-intelligence*,

    applying Victorian diction and prejudices to high-tech things. What was probably
    going through my mind was that Victorians would look askance at the term *artificial
    intelligence*, because they would be offended by the idea that computers could
    replace human brains. So they would probably want to bracket the idea as a simulation,

    was the current state of image-generating technology. There were a few things
    about that rubbing me the wrong way, the biggest being that they are benefiting
    from the uncredited work of thousands of real human artists. I’m going to exaggerate
    slightly, but it seems like one of the first applications of any new technology
    is making things even shittier for artists. That’s certainly happened with music.
    These image-generation systems just seemed like that was mechanized and weaponized
    on an inconceivable scale.'

    on just generated huge volumes of material and put them out willy-nilly on the

    onto a canvas, then the result might be bad or good, but at least it’s the result
    of a whole lot of micro-decisions you made as an artist. You were exercising editorial
    judgment with every paint stroke. That is absent in the output of these programs.

    in front of a camera, you perform once, and then lots of copies can be made. In
    the book, I thought it was a pretty positive vision of the future, where we have
    the technology that would enable voice actors to in effect give live performances
    on demand, all the time. Even with today’s voice clones, if you break it down
    to its simplest element, there’s still a human who sat in front of a microphone
    and provided this material. Although I guess a system like the Primer might not
    work live; you would probably have some lag—the AI is generating the text and
    sending it to the ractor, and then the ractor has to read it.'

    But eventually, the source code for the book falls into the hands of a man who
    wants to manufacture it on a massive scale, and there’s not enough money and not
    enough actors in the world to voice all those books, so at that point, he decides
    to use automatically generated voices.'

    have access to education. The Primer is designed for an aristocrat, but your novel
    also traces the stories of middle- and working-class girls who interact with versions

    very expensive to run. How do you think access to generative AI might play out?'

    There was a tendency to assume that when all the world’s knowledge comes online,
    everyone will flock to it. It turns out that if you give everyone access to the
    Library of Congress, what they do is watch videos on TikTok. *The Diamond Age*

    to what these things are doing. A chatbot is not an oracle; it’s a statistics
    engine that creates sentences that sound accurate. Right now my sense is that
    it’s like we’ve just invented transistors. We’ve got a couple of consumer products
    that people are starting to adopt, like the transistor radio, but we don’t yet
    know how the transistor will transform society. We’re in the transistor-radio
    stage of AI. I think a lot of the ferment that’s happening right now in the industry
    is venture capitalists putting money into business plans, and teams that are rapidly
    evaluating a whole lot of different things that could be done well. I’m sure that
    some things are going to emerge that I wouldn’t dare try to predict, because the
    results of the creative frenzy of millions of people are always more interesting
    than what a single person can think of.'
