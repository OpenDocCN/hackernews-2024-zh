- en: Charlie Chaplin’s first full-length feature film, *The Kid* (1921), remains
    one of the great masterpieces of silent cinema. It was an ambitious, risky project;
    industry professionals were cynical about his ambition to combine heartfelt pathos
    with slapstick comedy. Chaplin, however, was undeterred and the film became a
    worldwide hit, with much praise being given to his dual performance with Jackie
    Coogan, who was five years old at the time of shooting. The boy’s overnight success
    was immediately followed by another starring role as a lovable waif in *Oliver
    Twist* (1922), where he gave a scene-stealing performance alongside Lon Chaney
    as Fagin. With his acting career blossoming, it became common to spot Coogan’s
    likeness on pencil cases, coasters, lunch boxes and dolls. These lucrative endorsements
    and film roles would earn him millions.

  zh: 查理·卓别林的首部长篇电影*《小子》*（1921年），仍然是无声电影的伟大杰作之一。这是一个雄心勃勃、冒险的项目；行业专业人士对他希望将深情的悲剧与滑稽喜剧结合的野心持怀疑态度。然而，卓别林毫不气馁，这部电影成为了全球的一大成功，他与当时只有五岁的杰基·库根的双重表演备受赞誉。男孩的一夜成名随即在1922年的*《雾都孤儿》*中得到延续，在这部电影中，他与隆·钱尼饰演的费金一起，表现出色，深入人心。随着他的演艺事业蓬勃发展，库根的形象很快就出现在铅笔盒、杯垫、午餐盒和玩偶上。这些有利可图的代言和电影角色使他赚得了数百万美元。
