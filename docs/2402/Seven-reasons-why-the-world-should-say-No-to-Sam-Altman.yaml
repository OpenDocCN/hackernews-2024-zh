    capacity would use (in precise technical terms) a metric shit ton of energy. And
    let’s not kid ourselves about it all being “renewable”. Someone on X compared
    the (current) needs of GenAI to the power consumption of the entire nation of
    Germany. My guess is that is actually a very conservative estimate going forward,
    particularly if models continue the trend of becoming bigger and more costly to
    train. *Already* there is pressure from GenAI to [keep coal plants on](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/esg/ai-needs-so-much-power-that-old-coal-plants-are-sticking-around).
    Needless to say– oh no, I guess I do have to say it — using that much energy is
    not something that not be taken lightly. So far GenAI has been mostly promise,
    rather then delivery. There is no argument yet that it is actually worth tearing
    up the globe.'

    I know the fantasy here is generative AI will make the whole pie vastly bigger,

    Making even a tenth of the $7T investment, and giving it all to a guy who has

    now; worse that companies like OpenAI seem content to let society bear all the
    costs, like some careless industrial plant belching out toxic chemicals back in
    the day. Even war is not out of the question. As Sharon Goldman noted yesterday,
    “shortages of rare earth minerals such as gallium and germanium have even helped
    inflame the [global chip war](https://cepa.org/article/china-gallium-and-germanium-the-minerals-inflaming-the-global-chip-war/)
    with China”. If the battles over resources became acute enough, actual war could
    ensue. And, let’s be honest folks, the “alignment problem” isn’t remotely solved.
    Many of the leaders in AI have signed a letter saying this technology could kill
    us all. Why are we in such a big rush?

    is developing too quickly and the real use cases haven’t been proven yet. We should
    get to something real first, then scale it. It’s a good thing Sony didn’t convince
