- en: Therapeutic cancer vaccines are an appealing strategy for treating malignancies.
    In theory, when a patient is injected with peptide antigens — protein fragments
    from mutant proteins only expressed by tumor cells — T cells learn to recognize
    and attack cancer cells expressing the corresponding protein. By teaching the
    patient’s own immune system to attack cancer cells, these vaccines ideally would
    not only eliminate tumors but prevent them from recurring.

    Darrell Irvine, a professor in the MIT departments of Biological Engineering and
    Materials Science and Engineering and a member of the Koch Institute for Integrative
    Cancer Research at MIT. “But even in mouse and other models, they typically only
    provoke a weak immune response. And once those vaccines are tested in a clinical
    setting, their efficacy evaporates.”

    an MIT spinout that Irvine founded to translate experiments into treatment, is
    showing promising results in clinical trials — including Phase 1 data suggesting
    the vaccine could serve as a viable option for the treatment of pancreatic and
    other cancers.

    he wanted to dive into the problem of why cancer vaccines have failed to deliver
    on their promise. He discovered that one important reason peptide vaccines for
    cancer and other diseases tend not to elicit a strong immune response is because
    they do not travel in sufficient quantities to lymph nodes, where populations
    of teachable T cells are concentrated. He knew that attempts to target peptides
    to the lymph nodes had been imprecise: Even when delivered with nanoparticles
    or attached to antibodies for lymphatic immune cells, too many vaccine peptides
    were taken up by the wrong cells in the tissues or never even made it to the lymph
    nodes.'

- en: In the pursuit of an answer, Liu and his Irvine Lab colleagues would make discoveries
    crucial to trafficking peptides to the lymph nodes and developing a vaccine that
    provoked surprisingly strong immune responses in mice. That vaccine, now in the
    hands of Irvine Lab spinout Elicio Therapeutics, Inc., has produced early clinical
    results showing a similarly strong immune response in human patients.

    injected in the skin or muscle generally rapidly leak into the bloodstream, where
    they are diluted and degraded rather than traveling to the lymph nodes. He tried
    bulking up and protecting the peptide vaccine by enclosing it within a micellar
    nanoparticle. This type of nanoparticle is composed of “amphiphilic” molecules,
    with hydrophilic heads that, in a water-based solution, encase a payload attached
    to its hydrophobic lipid tails. Liu tested two versions, one that locked the micellar
    molecules together to securely enclose the peptide vaccine and another, the control,
    that did not. Despite all the sophisticated chemistry that went into the locked
    micellar nanoparticles, they induced a weak immune response. Liu was crushed.

    strongest immune response he had ever seen. Liu had hit on a potential solution

    the biology of the lymph node. He learned that after removing a tumor, surgeons
    use a small blue dye to image lymph nodes to determine the extent of metastasis.
    Contrary to expectation raised by the dye molecule’s small molecular weight, it
    does not vanish into the bloodstream after administration. Instead, the dye binds
    to albumin, the most common protein in blood and tissue fluids, and tracks reliably
    to the lymph nodes.

    Once injected into the tissue, the “loose” micelles were broken up by albumin,
    which then carried the peptide payload just where it needed to go.

    models of HIV, melanoma, and cervical cancer. In the resulting [2014 study](https://news.mit.edu/2014/hitchhiking-vaccines-boost-immunity-0216),
    they observed that peptides modified to bind albumin produced a T cell response
    that was five to 10 times greater than the response to peptides alone.

    responses. In [one study](https://news.mit.edu/2019/car-t-cell-therapy-cancer-0711),
    the Irvine Lab paired a cancer-targeted vaccine with CAR T cell therapy. CAR T
    has been used to treat blood cancers such as leukemia successfully but has not
    worked well for solid tumors, which suppress T cells in their immediate vicinity.
    The vaccine and CAR T cell therapy together dramatically increased antitumor T
    cell populations and the number of T cells that successfully invaded the tumor.
    The combination resulted in the elimination of 60% of solid tumors in mice, while
    CAR T cell therapy alone had almost no effect.

    to other gold standard vaccine approaches, and this gave us hope that these results

    peptides with an immune adjuvant—no CAR T cells required. In 2021, the company
    began a clinical trial, AMPLIFY-201, of a vaccine named ELI-002, targeting cancers
    with mutations in the KRAS gene, with a focus on pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma
    (PDAC). The vaccine has the potential to fill an urgent need in cancer treatment:
    PDAC accounts for 90% of pancreatic cancers, is highly aggressive, and has limited
    options for effective treatment. KRAS mutations drive 90-95% of all PDAC cases,
    but there are several variations that must be individually targeted for effective
    treatment. Elicio’s cancer vaccine has the potential to target up to seven KRAS
    variants at once covering 88% of PDAC cases. The company has initially tested
    a version that targets two, and Phase 1 and 2 studies of the version targeting
    all seven KRAS mutants are ongoing.'
