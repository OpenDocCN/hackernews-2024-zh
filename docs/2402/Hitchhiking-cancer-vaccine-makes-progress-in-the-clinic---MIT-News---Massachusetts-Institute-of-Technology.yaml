- en: Therapeutic cancer vaccines are an appealing strategy for treating malignancies.
    In theory, when a patient is injected with peptide antigens — protein fragments
    from mutant proteins only expressed by tumor cells — T cells learn to recognize
    and attack cancer cells expressing the corresponding protein. By teaching the
    patient’s own immune system to attack cancer cells, these vaccines ideally would
    not only eliminate tumors but prevent them from recurring.

    Darrell Irvine, a professor in the MIT departments of Biological Engineering and
    Materials Science and Engineering and a member of the Koch Institute for Integrative
    Cancer Research at MIT. “But even in mouse and other models, they typically only
    provoke a weak immune response. And once those vaccines are tested in a clinical
    setting, their efficacy evaporates.”

    he wanted to dive into the problem of why cancer vaccines have failed to deliver
    on their promise. He discovered that one important reason peptide vaccines for
    cancer and other diseases tend not to elicit a strong immune response is because
    they do not travel in sufficient quantities to lymph nodes, where populations
    of teachable T cells are concentrated. He knew that attempts to target peptides
    to the lymph nodes had been imprecise: Even when delivered with nanoparticles
    or attached to antibodies for lymphatic immune cells, too many vaccine peptides
    were taken up by the wrong cells in the tissues or never even made it to the lymph
    nodes.'

    Therapeutics, Inc.公司掌握，并在早期临床试验中显示出类似的强免疫反应。
- en: Liu began with testing peptide vaccines in mouse models, finding that peptides
    injected in the skin or muscle generally rapidly leak into the bloodstream, where
    they are diluted and degraded rather than traveling to the lymph nodes. He tried
    bulking up and protecting the peptide vaccine by enclosing it within a micellar
    nanoparticle. This type of nanoparticle is composed of “amphiphilic” molecules,
    with hydrophilic heads that, in a water-based solution, encase a payload attached
    to its hydrophobic lipid tails. Liu tested two versions, one that locked the micellar
    molecules together to securely enclose the peptide vaccine and another, the control,
    that did not. Despite all the sophisticated chemistry that went into the locked
    micellar nanoparticles, they induced a weak immune response. Liu was crushed.

    the biology of the lymph node. He learned that after removing a tumor, surgeons
    use a small blue dye to image lymph nodes to determine the extent of metastasis.
    Contrary to expectation raised by the dye molecule’s small molecular weight, it
    does not vanish into the bloodstream after administration. Instead, the dye binds
    to albumin, the most common protein in blood and tissue fluids, and tracks reliably
    to the lymph nodes.

  zh: 在刘进行微胶囊纳米粒子研究的同时，他也深入探索淋巴结的生物学。他了解到，在移除肿瘤后，外科医生使用一种小蓝色染料来成像淋巴结，以确定转移的程度。与染料分子小分子量引起的预期相反，该染料在给药后并不会消失到血流中。相反，该染料会结合到白蛋白，即血液和组织液中最常见的蛋白质，并可可靠地追踪到淋巴结。

    responses. In [one study](https://news.mit.edu/2019/car-t-cell-therapy-cancer-0711),
    the Irvine Lab paired a cancer-targeted vaccine with CAR T cell therapy. CAR T
    has been used to treat blood cancers such as leukemia successfully but has not
    worked well for solid tumors, which suppress T cells in their immediate vicinity.
    The vaccine and CAR T cell therapy together dramatically increased antitumor T
    cell populations and the number of T cells that successfully invaded the tumor.
    The combination resulted in the elimination of 60% of solid tumors in mice, while
    CAR T cell therapy alone had almost no effect.
