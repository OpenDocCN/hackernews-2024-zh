    SMEs, will not have to wait for their money, as well as to enhance the safety
    of transfers. Banks and other payment service providers (PSPs) will have to ensure
    credit transfers are affordable and immediately processed. The text, [already
    agreed with EU member states](https://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/press-room/20231031IPR08706/agreement-reached-on-more-accessible-instant-payments-in-euros),
    updates the current [Single Euro Payments Area](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/paym/integration/retail/sepa/html/index.en.html#:~:text=Thanks%20to%20the%20Single%20Euro,way%2C%20just%20like%20national%20payments.)

    or hour and the money must arrive into the recipient’s account within ten seconds.
    The payer should be also informed within ten seconds of whether or not the funds
    transferred have been made available to the intended recipient.

    where the accounts already offer regular transactions in euro, after a longer
    transition period. There will be a special derogation from making the payment
    within ten seconds for such accounts outside business hours, given possible concerns
    about access to liquidity in euro.

    and prevention measures, to avoid credit transfers going into the wrong account

    and without any additional charges or fees, provide a service to verify the identity
