    heavy, buggy tooling to build for the web because “we’re building apps, not websites.”

    single drop of JavaScript.

    chat rooms where literally `form` elements that you typed into. You’d submit to
    the server, the page would update, and your post would be displayed. If you wanted
    to see new posts, you’d refresh the browser.

    Ajax and partial UI updates is a much better UX.

    fragile JS that powers it fails is *also* a better UX than getting a blank white
    screen.

    that send data from the browser to the server.

    a setup like that, and *why* its a superior approach for both the people who use
    your site *and* the developers who build it.
