    that it’s adapting William Gibson’s seminal cyberpunk novel *Neuromancer* into
    a 10-episode series. Graham Roland (*Lost*, *Jack Ryan*) will serve as showrunner,
    while JD Dillard (*Utopia*) will direct the first episode. (Both will also be
    executive producers on the series.)

    might start streaming or who will star. In [a press release](https://www.apple.com/tv-pr/news/2024/02/apple-tv-announces-neuromancer-new-drama-based-on-the-multi-award-winning-science-fiction-novel-by-william-gibson/),
    Apple said that the show “will follow a damaged, top-rung super-hacker named Case
    who is thrust into a web of digital espionage and high stakes crime with his partner
    Molly, a razor-girl assassin with mirrored eyes aiming to pull a heist on a corporate
    dynasty with untold secrets.”
