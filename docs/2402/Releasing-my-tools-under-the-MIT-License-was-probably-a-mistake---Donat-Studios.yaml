- en: For basically as long as I can remember, I have been a staunch defender of permissive
    licenses over the more copyleft variety. I *want* you to use things I've written.
    On top of that I don't believe it's my place to force you to then open source
    things you have written that expand upon my source code. Hence my extensive use
    of the MIT License.

- en: The MIT License is very simple. It basically says you can do whatever you want
    with the code, but you have to include the license and copyright when redistributing
    the code itself. It does not however require you to open source any modifications
    you make to the code, nor provide attribution to the non-code products of the
    work.

    contribute fixes back, and often donate back to me. I love it. I want you to use
    my code in your proprietary software. I open sourced it so you could do that.
    I specifically build open source libraries because I solved a problem I thought
    other people might face and wanted to save them time. Lifting the sea for all
    boats and all that. I have zero problem continuing to use the MIT License on my
    libraries.

    to [Pixel Circle / Oval Generator](https://donatstudios.com/PixelCircleGenerator)
    and [Batch RewriteRule Generator](https://donatstudios.com/RewriteRule_Generator).
    The MIT License seemed like the natural choice because I've been using it for
    everything I've released since the early 2000's.

    I thought people would reuse. My intentions open sourcing these tools, unlike
    my libraries, was to promote the community helping me to improve them - and they
    certainly have done so. I have gotten so much great feedback and contributions
    to these tools, and I am very happy with that. Massive shout out to [Tyson453](https://github.com/Tyson453)
    for his insanely awesome work improving the speed of the Pixel Circle / Oval Generator.

- en: Against my well meaning intentions however, websites re-hosting my tools have
    been popping up like weeds. In some cases, they are even beating me in search
    results for my own tools. With noted exception, they don't credit me as the author
    or provide any sort of link back. Many of them have made minor or major modifications
    to the tools, and next to none provide the source to those modifications. A number
    of them even have the gall to post links advertising them in the comments of my
    own tools.

    in ads and SEO keywords. My tools are being associated with a genuinely bad user

    It just is not in the spirit of what I intended. I didn't have the foresight to
    see this coming. I didn't think people so lacked in the spirit of open source.
    I wanted to promote community contributions, not to have them monetized by other
    people who **don't even provide the source to their modifications**. I wanted
    to grow the tools as a community, not have closed source forks of them overtake
    my own open source versions.

    so. I could try to contact the owners of these sites and ask them to provide the
    source to their modifications, but again there is no obligation for them to do
    so. I really wish to see the changes shared alike, and the vain part of me would
    like attribution as the original author. At the end of the day though I chose
    the MIT License and it is what it is. It simply does not require any of that.

    my website Donat Studios was completely blocked from Bing search results. This
    in turn meant I didn't show up in DuckDuckGo or Yahoo results either. This meant
    that for a time the only results when searching these sites for my tools were
    these re-hosted versions.

    the content on this site is licensed under. It would not apply to current and
    past versions of the tools as that code is licensed MIT and you can't un-ring
    that bell. It would however apply to future versions. This would still promote
    community contributions, but would also require that any modifications be shared

    to be credited as the original author.

    them monetized by others without even a link back to my website.
