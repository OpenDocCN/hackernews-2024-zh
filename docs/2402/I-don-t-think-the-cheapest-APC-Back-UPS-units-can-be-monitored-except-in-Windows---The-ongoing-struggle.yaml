    BX1600MI in Linux without seeing a constant stream of spurious battery detach/reattach

    computers and multiple UPSes of that model. It doesn’t happen in their own proprietary
    Windows software, so I think they’ve changed the protocol.'

    bothered with a UPS at home. Our power grid is very reliable. Looking at availability
    information from “[uptimed](https://github.com/rpodgorny/uptimed)“, my home file
    server has been powered on for 99.97% of the time in the last 14 years. That includes
    time spent moving house and a day when the house power was off for several hours
    while the kitchen was refitted!

    for the sockets causing everything to be harshly powered off. My fileserver took
    it badly and one drive died. That wasn’t a huge issue as it has a redundant filesystem,
    but I didn’t like it.

    their cheapest offering. Many people were dismissive calling them cheap pieces
    of crap with flimsy plastic construction and batteries that are not regarded as
    user-replaceable. But there was no indication that such a model would not work,
    and I felt it hard to justify paying a lot here.

    replace the battery in 3 to 5 years. To do it yourself voids your warranty, but
    your warranty is done after 3 years anyway. It looked pretty doable even for a
    hardware-avoidant person like myself.

    entire point here is that the computer detects when the battery is near to exhausted
    and gracefully powers itself down. There are two main options on Linux for this:
    [**apcupsd**](http://www.apcupsd.org/) and [Network UPS Tools](https://networkupstools.org/index.html)
    (“**nut**“).'

    says it can be monitored with APC’s own Powerchute Serial Shutdown Windows software.
    There’s an entry in **nut**‘s hardware compatibility list for “Back-UPS (USB)”
    of “supported, based on publicly available protocol”. I made the order.

    It was hopeless trying to talk to it with **nut** though. **nut** just kept saying
    it was losing communications.

    stream of battery detach/reattach and power fail/restore events each lasting less
    than 2 seconds. Normally on a power fail you’d expect a visual and audible alert
    on the UPS itself and I wasn’t getting any of that, but I don’t know if that’s
    because they were real events that were just too brief.

    APC. I just contacted the vendor and told them I thought it was faulty and I wanted
    to return it. They actually offered to send me another one in advance and me send
    back the one I had, so I went for that.

    pass through USB to it. Guess what? No spurious events in PCSS on Windows. It
    detected expected events when I yanked the power etc. I had no evidence that the
    UPS was in any way faulty. You can probably see what is coming.

    non-Windows. That will have to be my working theory unless someone who has it
    working with non-Windows contacts me to let me know I am wrong, which I would
    be interested to know about. I feel like I’ve done all that I can to find such
    people, by asking on the mailing list for the software that is meant for monitoring
    APC UPSes on Unix.

    1.5kVA](https://www.riello-ups.co.uk/products/1-ups/63-net-power) which is [listed
    as fully supported by **nut**](https://networkupstools.org/stable-hcl.html?manufacturer=Riello&model=NPW%20600/800/1000/1500/2000).
    They are taking the APC units back for a full refund; the Riello is about £30
    more expensive.
