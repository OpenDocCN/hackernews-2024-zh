- en: The global state of a fossil repository consists of an unordered [collection
    of artifacts](https://fossil-scm.org/home/doc/trunk/www/fileformat.wiki). Each
    artifact is identified by a cryptographic hash of its content, expressed as a
    lower-case hexadecimal string. Synchronization is the process of sharing artifacts
    between repositories so that all repositories have copies of all artifacts. Because
    artifacts are unordered, the order in which artifacts are received is unimportant.
    It is assumed that the hash names of artifacts are unique - that every artifact
    has a different hash. To a first approximation, synchronization proceeds by sharing
    lists of hashes for available artifacts, then sharing the content of artifacts
    whose names are missing from one side or the other of the connection. In practice,
    a repository might contain millions of artifacts. The list of hash names for this
    many artifacts can be large. So optimizations are employed that usually reduce
    the number of hashes that need to be shared to a few dozen.

    formatting preferences, authorized users, ticket formats, and similar information
    that varies from one repository to another. The local state is not usually transferred
    during a sync. Except, some local state is transferred during a [clone](https://fossil-scm.org/home/help?cmd=clone)
    in order to initialize the local state of the new repository. Also, an administrator
    can sync local state using the [config push](https://fossil-scm.org/home/help?cmd=configuration)
    and [config pull](https://fossil-scm.org/home/help?cmd=configuration) commands.

    of a particular [Conflict-Free Replicated Datatype (CRDT)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conflict-free_replicated_data_type)
    called a "G-Set" or "Grow-only Set". The academic literature on CRDTs only began
    to appear in about 2011, and Fossil predates that research by at least 4 years.
    But it is nice to know that theorists have now proven that the underlying data

    communication and without any kind of central authority.

- en: When a repository knows that an artifact exists and knows the ID of that artifact,
    but it does not know the artifact content, then it stores that artifact as a "phantom".
    A repository will typically create a phantom when it receives an igot card for
    an artifact that it does not hold or when it receives a file card that references
    a delta source that it does not hold. When a server is generating its reply or
    when a client is generating a new request, it will usually send gimme cards for
    every phantom that it holds.

    separated by the newline ("\n") character. Each card consists of a single character
    card type, a space, and a single argument. No extra whitespace and no trailing
    or leading whitespace is allowed. All cards in the cluster must occur in strict
    lexicographical order.

- en: A cluster consists of one or more "M" cards followed by a single "Z" card. Each
    M card holds an argument which is an artifact ID for an artifact in the repository.
    The Z card has a single argument which is the lower-case hexadecimal representation
    of the MD5 checksum of all preceding M cards up to and included the newline character
    that occurred just before the Z that starts the Z card.

    not a cluster. There must be no extra whitespace in the artifact. There must be
    one or more M cards. There must be a single Z card with a correct MD5 checksum.
    And all cards must be in strict lexicographical order.

- en: Every repository maintains a table named "**unclustered**" which records the
    identity of every artifact and phantom it holds that is not mentioned in a cluster.
    The entries in the unclustered table can be thought of as leaves on a tree of
    artifacts. Some of the unclustered artifacts will be other clusters. Those clusters
    may contain other clusters, which might contain still more clusters, and so forth.
    Beginning with the artifacts in the unclustered table, one can follow the chain
    of clusters to find every artifact in the repository.
