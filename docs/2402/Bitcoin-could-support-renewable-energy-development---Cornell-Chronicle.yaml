- en: Bitcoin mining is often perceived as environmentally damaging because it uses
    huge amounts of electricity to power its intensive computing needs, but what if
    the mining process could be used to mitigate climate change instead of accelerating
    it?

  zh: 比特币挖掘通常被认为对环境有害，因为它需要大量电力来支持其高强度的计算需求，但如果挖掘过程可以用来缓解气候变化而不是加速它呢？
- en: A new study led by Cornell researchers investigated planned renewable energy
    projects across the U.S. and calculated each project’s potential to profit from
    bitcoin mining during the precommercial development phase, when a wind or solar
    farm is generating electricity, but has not yet been integrated into the grid.
    The findings suggest some developers could be recouping millions of dollars, which
    could be invested in future renewable energy projects.

- en: The analysis showed that Texas is the state with the highest potential, with
    32 planned renewable projects that could generate combined profits of $47 million
    using bitcoin mining during precommercial operations. The researchers determined
    that the Aktina Solar and Roseland Solar Projects in Texas – each with 250 megawatt
    capacities – were found to be the most profitable, generating a maximum profit
    of $3.23 million. The Western Trail Wind project, with a capacity of 367 megawatts,
    showed profitability of $2.65 million.

- en: “These rewards can act as an incentive for miners to adopt clean energy sources,
    which can lead to combined positive effects on climate change mitigation, improved
    renewable power capacity and additional profits during precommercial operation
    of wind or solar farms,” Lal said. “We also recommend policies that encourage
    cryptocurrency-mining operations to return some of their profits back into infrastructure
    development. This would help create a self-sustaining cycle for renewable energy
    expansion.”

  zh: “这些奖励可以作为激励矿工采用清洁能源的手段，这不仅对气候变化减缓有积极的影响，还可以提高可再生能源容量并在风能或太阳能场商业化前操作时额外增加盈利，”Lal说。“我们还建议采纳政策，鼓励加密货币挖掘运营商将部分利润投入到基础设施建设中。这将有助于创建可持续发展的可再生能源扩展循环。”
- en: While other aspects of cryptocurrency mining still have environmental costs,
    such as metal depletion and hardware that becomes obsolete within a few years,
    the researchers said the results indicate that there are ways to mitigate some
    of the environmental costs of cryptocurrency mining and foster investments in
    renewable energy.
