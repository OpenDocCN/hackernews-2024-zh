- en: A novel disc the size of a DVD can hold more than 1 million gigabits—roughly
    as much as is [transmitted per second over the entire world’s Internet](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2022/10/27/laser-powered-chip-internet-data-transfer/)—by
    storing data in three dimensions as opposed to two, a new study finds.

    encode data using a series of microscopic pits. These pits, and the islands between
    them, together represent the 0s and 1s of binary code that computers use to symbolize
    information. CD, DVD, and Blu-ray players use lasers to read the data encoded
    in these discs.

- en: Although optical discs are low in cost and highly durable, they are limited
    by the amount of data they can hold, which is usually stored in a single layer.
    Previously, scientists investigated encoding data on optical discs in many layers
    in [three dimensions](https://spectrum.ieee.org/racetrack-memory) to boost their
    capacity. However, a key barrier that prior research faced was how the optics
    used to read and write this data were limited to roughly the size of the wavelengths
    of light they used.

- en: Now scientists in China have developed a way to encode data on 100 layers in
    optical discs. In addition, the data is recorded using spots as small as 54 nanometers
    wide, roughly a tenth of the size of the wavelengths of visible light used to
    read and write the data.

    is, 1.6 million gigabits. This is some 4,000 times as much data density as a [Blu-ray
    disc](https://spectrum.ieee.org/the-consumer-electronics-hall-of-fame-samsung-bdp1000)
    and 24 times as much as the currently most advanced hard disks. The researchers
    suggest their new optical disc can enable a data center capable of exabit storage—a
    billion gigabits—to fit inside a room instead of a stadium-size space.

    The first, a green 515-nanometer laser, triggers spot formation, whereas the second,
    a red 639-nm laser, switches off the writing process. By controlling the time
    between firing of the lasers, the scientists could produce spots smaller than
    the wavelengths of light used to create them.

    a blue 480-nm beam, can make spots fluoresce, while the second, an orange 592-nm
    light, switches off the fluorescence process. Precise control over the firing
    of these lasers can single out which specific nanometer-scale spot ends up fluorescing.

- en: This new strategy depends on a novel light-sensitive material called AIE-DDPR
    that is capable of all these varied responses to different wavelengths of light.
    “It has been a 10-year effort searching for this kind of material,” Gu says. “The
    difficulty has been how the writing and reading processes affect each other in
    a given material—in particular, in a three-dimensional geometry.”

- en: The scientists encoded data on layers each separated by 1 micrometer. They found
    that the writing quality stayed comparable across all the layers. “Personally,
    I was surprised that nanoscale writing-recoding and reading processes both work
    well in our newly invented material,” Gu says.

- en: The researchers note that the entire procedure used to create blank discs made
    using AIE-DDPR films is compatible with conventional DVD mass production and can
    be completed within 6 minutes. Gu says these new discs may therefore prove to
    be manufacturable at commercial scales.

    and an energy consumption of microjoules to millijoules.

    data centers. As a result, they’re working to improve their new method’s writing
    speed and energy consumption. He suggests this may be possible using new, more
    energy-efficient recording materials. He says more layers in each disc may be
    possible in the future, using better lenses and fewer aberrations in their optics.
