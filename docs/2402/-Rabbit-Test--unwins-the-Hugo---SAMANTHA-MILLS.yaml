    Awards — good for you! (I’m going to have to explain this post to my mom when
    she reads it — hi, mom. ;_;) I’m summarizing here as much for my own benefit as
    anyone else’s, since this is my primary hub and record of my writing career goings-on.

    were released. They showed that a variety of potential finalists had mysteriously
    been marked “ineligible,” and also included frankly incomprehensible nominating
    numbers. Cue weeks of speculation and upset.

    simultaneously released on the [Genre Grapevine](https://jasonsanford.substack.com/p/the-2023-hugo-awards-a-report-on)
    and [File770](https://file770.com/the-2023-hugo-awards-a-report-on-censorship-and-exclusion/).
    It’s too much for me to repeat everything here, so head on over for the full story,
    but the short of it is: one of the 2023 award administrators leaked a set of emails
    showing that the American/Canadian contingent of the committee (voluntarily! proactively!
    and incompetently!) vetted potential finalists for political statements relating
    to China, and then the main administrator presumably used that info to mark some
    of them ineligible. It should be said: there’s no indication that Chinese censors
    even *cared* about the content of the English work. Some of it had already been
    translated into Chinese for goodness’ sake! So the Western members of the committee
    appear to have been flailing about based on what they *thought* China wouldn’t
    like, and preemptively self-censored, rather than, oh, I dunno, refusing to censor
    anything in the first place.'

    aka the tables of frontrunner nominees being vetted for the final ballot, and
    a horrible pattern emerged, especially in the fiction categories: there were a
    whole lot of Chinese nominees in frontrunner positions who just… vanished, and
    never made it onto the final ballot. There were so many, in fact, that if I am
    reading this document correctly: *not a single fiction winner* (short story, novelette,
    novella, novel, or series) would have even *been* a finalist if those nominees
    hadn’t been taken off.'

    from the admin who leaked the emails and validation tables: “We were told there
    was collusion in a Chinese publication that had published a nominations list,
    a slate as it were, and so those ballots were identified and eliminated.”'

    in Hugo nominating! And unless there is an even larger scandal waiting to break,
    there is no indication that there was any kind of illicit collusion (say, an individual
    or group mass-purchasing memberships). Instead it seems like there was something
    entirely ordinary going on: the Chinese magazine [Science Fiction World](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/jZZifGH_3Aa0uTvDWIqwUg)
    published instructions on how to nominate for the Hugos, and included some reading
    recommendations (which included both Chinese and English works, in Chinese and
    English publications, with a varying number of recs for each category). ([Thank
    you to Vajra Chandrasekera for finding the link.](https://bsky.app/profile/vajra.me/post/3kliuqgn3ib2f))

    anything other than: I shouldn’t have been on that ballot. On the one hand, it
    *seems* as though the final vote hasn’t been tampered with, and the voters engaged
    in good faith with the works they were told were the finalists, for which I still
    say thank you! But it’s really, really hard for me to see past the initial fact,
    which is that I shouldn’t have been on that ballot.'

    I wasn’t going to be a finalist, because even though the story had taken off like
    mad in the U.S., the bulk of the membership was not going to be American. I assumed
    we would see a lot of Chinese nominees — which would have been cool! We’d get
    a slice of international scifi that I rarely ever see! And then I was really pleasantly
    surprised to be informed I was a finalist after all. When the full ballot was
    posted, I was also surprised at how few Chinese nominees were in the fiction categories.
    There were four in the short story category, though, so I thought it was legit,
    and that wow, John Wiswell and I somehow made the cutoff anyway, isn’t that amazing!

    But then [due to concerns about the Worldcon event itself](https://samtasticbooks.com/2023/07/08/all-the-award-news-and-a-note-on-worldcon/),
    I elected not to participate in programming or accept a free trip to Chengdu.
    This was also fraught. I’ve never been to a Worldcon, and I’d never been nominated
    before. And as I said in my previous long-winded post on the subject, I have nothing
    against the fandoms at play. But I wasn’t comfortable being one of the faces of
    local PR under political circumstances that felt entirely above my pay grade,
    so I bowed out.

    used in this way — as a nice “no issues” name on a list, in order to further what
    appears to have been a xenophobic quest to keep the awards firmly American. I’m
    sorry for everyone whose enthusiasm was tossed in the trash. I’m sorry for everyone
    who should have been on the ballot. A Chinese fan went through the lists working
    out [what was dropped or moved around](https://zionius.wordpress.com/2024/02/15/2023-hugo-awards-censorship-analysis/).
    I don’t know how reliable my browser translation is, so I’m hoping to see more

    a Hugo winner. As I said, barring another rug-pull (good lord please no), I think
    that I was voted the winner of the published finalist list, and I remain grateful
    for that. But unless somebody comes along with information that the nomination
    numbers were not the final tallies and I would have been there after all, or some
    analysis showing that those works would have been ineligible or moved to other
    categories anyway — barring those unlikely circumstances, I have to consider my
    award ill-gained.

    of my bio. There are almost certainly going to be places it was printed that I
    miss, so my apologies for that. Here’s the most embarrassing one: my novel already
    went to the printer and it has “Hugo winner” on the cover. Fucking mortifying!
    It’s a holiday weekend and I don’t like to nag people on their days off, so on
    Tuesday I’ll send a very awkward email to my agent and editor summarizing the
    situation (if either of you see this beforehand… heyyyy teaaaam…. ;_;) and figure
    out the logistics of removing “Hugo winner” from the ebook and future printings.
    The first print run will be a limited edition novelty, I suppose? Jeez.'

    Chinese fandom and the rest of us who got tangled up in this mess, but of everyone
    I feel like I’m the least entitled to complain, so please don’t interpret this
    post as some kind of righteous call for any of the other nominees/winners to react
    in the same way I have. I won three other awards for “Rabbit Test” last year —
    a true wealth of love and attention. I appreciate the honors that have already
