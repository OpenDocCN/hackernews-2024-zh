    simultaneously released on the [Genre Grapevine](https://jasonsanford.substack.com/p/the-2023-hugo-awards-a-report-on)
    and [File770](https://file770.com/the-2023-hugo-awards-a-report-on-censorship-and-exclusion/).
    It’s too much for me to repeat everything here, so head on over for the full story,
    but the short of it is: one of the 2023 award administrators leaked a set of emails
    showing that the American/Canadian contingent of the committee (voluntarily! proactively!
    and incompetently!) vetted potential finalists for political statements relating
    to China, and then the main administrator presumably used that info to mark some
    of them ineligible. It should be said: there’s no indication that Chinese censors
    even *cared* about the content of the English work. Some of it had already been
    translated into Chinese for goodness’ sake! So the Western members of the committee
    appear to have been flailing about based on what they *thought* China wouldn’t
    like, and preemptively self-censored, rather than, oh, I dunno, refusing to censor
    anything in the first place.'

    a horrible pattern emerged, especially in the fiction categories: there were a
    whole lot of Chinese nominees in frontrunner positions who just… vanished, and
    never made it onto the final ballot. There were so many, in fact, that if I am
    reading this document correctly: *not a single fiction winner* (short story, novelette,
    novella, novel, or series) would have even *been* a finalist if those nominees
    hadn’t been taken off.'

    published instructions on how to nominate for the Hugos, and included some reading

    we would see a lot of Chinese nominees — which would have been cool! We’d get
    a slice of international scifi that I rarely ever see! And then I was really pleasantly
    surprised to be informed I was a finalist after all. When the full ballot was
    posted, I was also surprised at how few Chinese nominees were in the fiction categories.
    There were four in the short story category, though, so I thought it was legit,
    and that wow, John Wiswell and I somehow made the cutoff anyway, isn’t that amazing!

    But then [due to concerns about the Worldcon event itself](https://samtasticbooks.com/2023/07/08/all-the-award-news-and-a-note-on-worldcon/),
    I elected not to participate in programming or accept a free trip to Chengdu.
    This was also fraught. I’ve never been to a Worldcon, and I’d never been nominated
    before. And as I said in my previous long-winded post on the subject, I have nothing
    against the fandoms at play. But I wasn’t comfortable being one of the faces of
