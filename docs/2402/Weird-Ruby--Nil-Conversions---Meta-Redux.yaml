- en: 'Most Rubyists probably know that `nil` in Ruby is an instance of the singleton
    class [NilClass](https://ruby-doc.org/3.3.0/NilClass.html). Because `nil` is a
    object like any other, we can actually invoke methods on it, and it turns out
    that `NilClass` provides a few - mostly conversion methods to other Ruby types.
    Let’s see some of those in action:'

- en: I’m not sure how this “concept of nullity” is defined, but I’ve always found
    it weird that you can equate the absence of value with some anchor value (e.g.
    an empty collection or 0). I know there are contexts in which this may be useful,
    but I’m fairly certain you’d be able to get similar results without resorting
    to such conversions.

- en: Notice how the “safe” number conversion methods `Integer` and `Float` operate
    differently and raise an exception when passed `nil`. That’s part of the reason
    why it’s often suggested to avoid the use of `to_i` and `to_f` to avoid converting
    unexpected values.
