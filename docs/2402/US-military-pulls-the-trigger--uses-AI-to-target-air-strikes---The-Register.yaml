    Project Maven, which sought suppliers capable of developing object recognition
    software for footage captured by drones. Google pulled out of the project when
    its own employees [revolted](https://www.theregister.com/2018/06/02/ai_roundup/)
    against using AI for warfare, but other tech firms have [been happy](https://www.theregister.com/2020/07/09/pentagon_ai_report/)

    "by the end of the calendar year" to gather intelligence.

    Project Maven's computer vision systems in real campaigns after Hamas' surprise
    attack on Israel last year.

    then operate weapons systems. The US has reportedly used the software to identify
    enemy rockets, missiles, drones, and militia facilities.

    Moore said. The US Central Command has also tried to run an AI recommendation
    engine to see if it could suggest the best weapons to use in operations and create
    attack plans. The technology, however, "frequently fell short.'

    security risks that may result from issues such as poorly managed training data,"
    he [said](https://www.theregister.com/2024/02/21/dod_scaleai_contract/). "We must
    also consider the extent to which our adversaries will employ this technology
    and seek to disrupt our own use of AI-based solutions." ®'
