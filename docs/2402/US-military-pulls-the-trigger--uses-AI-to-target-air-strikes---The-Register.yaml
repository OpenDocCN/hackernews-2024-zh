    Project Maven, which sought suppliers capable of developing object recognition
    software for footage captured by drones. Google pulled out of the project when
    its own employees [revolted](https://www.theregister.com/2018/06/02/ai_roundup/)
    against using AI for warfare, but other tech firms have [been happy](https://www.theregister.com/2020/07/09/pentagon_ai_report/)

    engine to see if it could suggest the best weapons to use in operations and create
    attack plans. The technology, however, "frequently fell short.'
