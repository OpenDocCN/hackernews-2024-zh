    promotional material that marketing companies try to post on Wikipedia. Thanks
    to the community, paid editing firms rarely succeed in influencing the actual
    content on Wikipedia. There are paid editing firms that we are aware of with a
    0% success rate. Unfortunately, victims of these scams don't know this, and many
    paid editing firms act in a predatory manner taking advantage of this. If anyone
    receives an email or social media message from someone offering to make a Wikipedia
    page for you, then it is almost certainly a scam.

    It is likely that they are not telling the truth. The portfolios that they might
    send you as "proof" of their experience are almost certainly fabricated. As are
    the physical addresses that they list on their websites; they don't list their
    real addresses because they don't want to get caught by the Foundation. There
    are no paid editing firms that have a relationship with the Wikimedia Foundation.

    or requirements have been raised by Wikipedia. We estimate that the proceeds of
    this scam in 2023 were at least $500,000, and perhaps well over $1,000,000\.

    following a [sockpuppet investigation](/wiki/Wikipedia:Sockpuppet_investigations/CharmenderDeol

    and confirmed as sockpuppets of [CharmenderDeol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:CharmenderDeol).

    be nominated for deletion, or denied approval for publication. Then other editors,

    the article and "protect" it from deletion or unwanted changes — for a monthly
    charge. In reality, they couldn't protect anything, they didn't protect anything

    than going through the effort of trying to publish the article (and the risk of
    getting caught), the scammer may simply abandon the article, keeping the money.
    When the customers complain, the scammer blames the delay on Wikipedia, or tells
    the victim that other paid services are needed to ensure publication.

    the nonprofit [Days for Girls](/wiki/Days_for_Girls "Days for Girls") in 2008,
    and was its CEO until she retired in 2022\. She''s since written a book on the
    organization and its work, and is already promoting it with a book tour. Unfortunately,
    she''s not familiar with Wikipedia''s rules. She thought having a biography of
    her own on Wikipedia would help book sales, so she contacted Elite Wiki Writers,
    who promised that she would not have to reveal that she paid for the article because
    they "use legitimate Wiki-moderators". She even got a $100 discount off the $750
    fee for sending in a detailed draft.'

- en: Yvonna Cazares is a community organizer who has previously held several community-oriented
    positions in California's state and local governments. Her first contact of any
    sort with Elite Wiki Writers was when she was approached on LinkedIn. She told
    *The Signpost* that her main interest in Elite Wiki Writers was having them provide
    editorial services for a book that was near completion. They offered her a Wikipedia
    article as part of a package deal. The editorial services are a sideline that
    is not currently offered on the Elite Wiki Writers website. But following the
    online chats shown above with "GreySWA", they offered this reporter the same type
    of services.

- en: Elite Wiki Writers offered Cazares several book editing packages, costing up
    to $8,500\. Due to the low quality of the services and high cost, she soon believed
    that she was being scammed. She had difficulty getting a bank to accept a credit
    card payment, even though she had previously seen no problems with her credit
    card. Many credit card issuers have an effective system for avoiding liability
    for fraudulent credit card transactions. Charges coming from merchants who have
    had too many recent customer complaints can trigger a refusal of the transaction
    during the time you're waiting on the phone. Apparently, this is what happened
    to one of Cazares's transactions. She later tried to cancel her previous transactions,
    and with determination and some luck she is now off the hook. Luckily, she had
    saved the documentation on all the credit card payments and refusals.

    told that "Wikipedia moderators" now require eight citations, three more than
    the draft then had. And they would be willing to write the needed stories and
    quickly place them in top quality publications for only $5,000 apiece. Mergens
    settled for three "C-level" articles for only $1,500 apiece.

    draft — and the inaccuracies in it — and she only saw one new source in the draft.
    After she was offered another discount, she attempted to pay with a credit card.
    But the payment wouldn't go through. So another credit card was used, but the
    invoice arrived with the name of another company.

    additional services — for almost $4,000 — to ensure that the Wikipedia page could
    go live and "be protected". The services supposedly included eight ghostwritten
    articles to serve as citations, a Google [Knowledge Graph](/wiki/Google_Knowledge_Graph
    "Google Knowledge Graph"), wiki linking, and a semi-protection lock. After being
    charged for this, an additional $400 was charged to her credit card "for taxes"
    without notifying her or getting her permission.

    that Wikipedia required five citations and that they could provide these quickly
    from reputable news sources for an extra fee. He did his own research and provided
    Elite Wiki Writers with articles about him from local newspapers and major news
    sources from his state, but they did not use those sources.

    a loser. Wikipedians are victims because the encyclopedia's trademarks are used
    without permission. Volunteers' time, Wikipedia's most valuable resource, is wasted
    sorting out hundreds of poorly researched articles, looking for one just one or
    two notable subjects. Much valuable time is taken from some of our most senior
    and energetic editors, working on sockpuppet investigation and deletion discussions.
    Administrators' names and reputations are dragged through the mud. Nobody on Wikipedia
    benefits from having scammers operate here.
