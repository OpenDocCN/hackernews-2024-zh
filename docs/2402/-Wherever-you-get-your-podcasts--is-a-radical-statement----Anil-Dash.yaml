    the kind of technology that''s supposed to be impossible: open, empowering tech
    that''s not owned by any one company, that *can''t* be controlled by any one company,

  zh: 一点背景
- en: See, podcasting as a technology grew out of the early era of the social web,
    when the norms of technology creators were that they were expected to create open
    systems, which interoperated with tools by other creators and even other companies.
    This was based on the successes of earlier generations of the internet, like email
    and even the web itself. Podcasting was basically the last such invention to become
    mainstream, with millions of people listening every day, and countless people
    able to create in the medium. And of course, it creates tons of oppportunities
    for businesses too, whether it's people making amazing podcasts like Roman Mars
    does, or giants like Apple or Spotify building businesses around the medium.

  zh: 看，播客作为一种技术起源于社交网络早期时代，当时技术创作者的规范是他们被期望创建开放系统，这些系统可以与其他创作者甚至其他公司的工具相互操作。这是基于互联网的早期世代的成功，比如电子邮件甚至是网络本身。播客基本上是最后一个成为主流的发明，每天有数百万人听，无数人可以在其中创作。当然，它也为企业创造了大量的机会，无论是像Roman
    Mars一样制作了惊人的播客，还是像苹果或Spotify这样的巨头围绕这个媒介建立业务。
- en: Contrast this to other media formats online, like YouTube or Tiktok or Twitch,
    which don't rely on open systems, and are wholly owned by individual tech companies.
    On those platforms, creators are constantly chasing the latest algorithmic shifts,
    and are subject to the whims of advertising algorithms that are completely opaque.
    If a creator gets fed up enough to want to leave a platform, they're stuck — those
    viewers or listeners are tied to the company that hosts the content.

  zh: 与其他在线媒体格式形成对比，如YouTube或Tiktok或Twitch，它们不依赖开放系统，完全由个别科技公司拥有。在这些平台上，创作者不断追逐最新的算法变化，并受制于完全不透明的广告算法的幻想。如果创作者受够了想要离开平台，他们就被困住了——这些观众或听众与托管内容的公司紧密相连。
- en: But in the podcasting world, creators can (assuming they work out the business
    deals necessary to do so) actually take their ball and go home, because the underlying
    "feed" — the special file that podcasting apps look at to know when there's a
    new episode — is something they can actually move over to a new system or a new
    host, without losing all their subscribers or followers. Indeed, this idea of
    having a "portable" audience is so appealing that it's even been revived in the
    new wave of open format-based social networks that have arisen. When I found out
    that my Mastodon account was hosted by a company that was kind of shady, I was
    able to move it over to a Mastodon account run by [Medium](https://medium.com),
    and it was basically seamless for my followers, even though I had one of the biggest
    Mastodon follower counts in the world at the time. That capability is something
    most podcasters can do if they ever want to, too.

  zh: 但在播客世界中，创作者可以（假设他们解决了必要的业务交易）实际上带着自己的球回家，因为底层的“feed”——播客应用程序查看的特殊文件，用来知道何时有新的剧集——是他们实际上可以转移到新系统或新主机上的东西，而不会失去所有的订阅者或粉丝。实际上，拥有“可移植”受众的这种想法如此吸引人，以至于它甚至在新一波基于开放格式的社交网络中复兴了起来。当我发现我的Mastodon账户由一个相当可疑的公司托管时，我能够将其转移到由[Medium](https://medium.com)经营的Mastodon账户上，对于我的粉丝来说基本上是无缝的，尽管当时我是世界上拥有最多Mastodon粉丝的之一。如果播客们也想要的话，大多数人都可以做到这一点。

- en: Many times, the value of open technology systems can be measured by which ecosystems
    they extract dollars away from. Yes, some of the economic value of podcasting
    came by making a dent in things like terrestrial radio broadcasts. But a big part
    was also the fact that the open formats of podcasting make it extremely difficult
    to do the kind of surveillance-based advertising that has made companies like
    Google and Facebook worth trillions of dollars. In fact, despite their immense
    scale, neither of the biggest ad-based platforms on the internet can enable you
    to buy ads on podcasts. In that way, podcasts have reintroduced the wonderful
    kind of advertising inefficiencies that we saw in the heyday of print magazines,
    where advertisers were hoping that some part of the audience would mail back one
    of those blow-in cards that used to be sandwiched into the binding of a magazine.
    (Kids, ask your grandparents.)

  zh: 很多时候，开放技术系统的价值可以通过它们从哪些生态系统中抽走资金来衡量。是的，播客的经济价值的一部分来自于对诸如地面广播等事物造成的影响。但其中一个重要原因也是播客的开放格式使得基于监视的广告变得极其困难，而这种广告已经使得像谷歌和Facebook这样的公司价值数万亿美元。事实上，尽管它们规模庞大，但互联网上最大的两家基于广告的平台都不能让你在播客上购买广告。在这方面，播客重新引入了我们在印刷杂志全盛时期看到的精彩的广告低效，广告商希望观众中的一部分会寄回那些曾经夹在杂志装订里的插页卡。
    （孩子们，问问你们的祖父母。）
- en: Advertising inefficiencies are fantastic! In the ad industry, the old (likely
    apocryphal) line one would always hear is, "Half the money I spend on advertising
    is wasted; the trouble is I don’t know which half." But for creators, and for
    the world, that inefficiency was often wonderful. The inefficiency of old media
    formats resulted in less surveillance of the purchasing and behavioral habits
    of individuals, and larger surpluses that sustained a healthier, more vibrant
    media ecosystem that could even afford to invest in important stories or content
    despite the fact that they might not have a large audience.

  zh: 广告低效是太棒了！在广告行业，人们经常听到的一句（可能是虚构的）话是，“我在广告上花的一半钱是浪费的；问题是我不知道哪一半。”但对于创作者和整个世界来说，那种低效往往是美好的。旧媒体格式的低效导致对个人的购买和行为习惯的监视减少，以及更大的盈余，这维持了一个更健康、更有活力的媒体生态系统，甚至可以在没有大量观众的情况下投资于重要的故事或内容。
- en: What podcasting holds in the promise of its open format is the proof that an
    open web can still thrive and be relevant, that it can inspire new systems that
    are similarly open to take root and grow. Even the biggest companies in the world
    can't displace these kinds of systems once they find their audiences. And that's
    not to say that there aren't shortcomings or problems with these systems, too.
    But, for example, when someone makes a podcast that's about encouraging hate,
    there's no one centralized system that can automatically suggest it to an audience
    and push them down a path of further radicalization.

- en: And of course, the winner-takes-all world of media being consumed by tech means
    that the economics of individual podcast production are often brutal now, sometimes
    simply *because* creators can't rely on outsourcing advertising sales to one of
    the big platforms. An open system isn't a panacea for all that's broken in the
    media ecosystem.

- en: But what we can take away from hearing "wherever you find podcasts" at the end
    of every episode we listen to is that, sometimes without us knowing, radical systems
    can survive and even thrive in the modern world of tech and media. They can inspire
    new creators to make similar systems that are unowned, uncentralized, and a little
    bit uncontrollable. And in this era where we're seeing [the renaissance of the
    open web](https://www.anildash.com/2024/01/03/human-web-renaissance/), they point
    the way toward a future where we can use the same tone to say "wherever you find
    news" or "wherever you find your friends online", and know that it means that
    there's a way that our lives online could be fully in our own control.
