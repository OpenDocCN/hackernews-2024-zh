    ever listened to: "Listen to us on your favorite podcast app", or in the phrasing
    of podcaster extraordinare Roman Mars, "...wherever you find podcasts". (By the
    way, you should be radicalized by the recent 99 Percent Invisible episode on how
    ["cooking with gas" is mostly a conspiracy](https://99percentinvisible.org/episode/cooking-with-gas/),

    is a *radical statement*. Because what it represents is the triumph of exactly
    the kind of technology that''s supposed to be impossible: open, empowering tech
    that''s not owned by any one company, that *can''t* be controlled by any one company,
    and that allows people to have ownership over their work and their relationship
    with their audience.'

- en: See, podcasting as a technology grew out of the early era of the social web,
    when the norms of technology creators were that they were expected to create open
    systems, which interoperated with tools by other creators and even other companies.
    This was based on the successes of earlier generations of the internet, like email
    and even the web itself. Podcasting was basically the last such invention to become
    mainstream, with millions of people listening every day, and countless people
    able to create in the medium. And of course, it creates tons of oppportunities
    for businesses too, whether it's people making amazing podcasts like Roman Mars
    does, or giants like Apple or Spotify building businesses around the medium.

    which don't rely on open systems, and are wholly owned by individual tech companies.
    On those platforms, creators are constantly chasing the latest algorithmic shifts,
    and are subject to the whims of advertising algorithms that are completely opaque.
    If a creator gets fed up enough to want to leave a platform, they're stuck — those
    viewers or listeners are tied to the company that hosts the content.

    deals necessary to do so) actually take their ball and go home, because the underlying
    "feed" — the special file that podcasting apps look at to know when there's a
    new episode — is something they can actually move over to a new system or a new
    host, without losing all their subscribers or followers. Indeed, this idea of
    having a "portable" audience is so appealing that it's even been revived in the
    new wave of open format-based social networks that have arisen. When I found out
    that my Mastodon account was hosted by a company that was kind of shady, I was
    able to move it over to a Mastodon account run by [Medium](https://medium.com),
    and it was basically seamless for my followers, even though I had one of the biggest
    Mastodon follower counts in the world at the time. That capability is something
    most podcasters can do if they ever want to, too.

- en: Many times, the value of open technology systems can be measured by which ecosystems
    they extract dollars away from. Yes, some of the economic value of podcasting
    came by making a dent in things like terrestrial radio broadcasts. But a big part
    was also the fact that the open formats of podcasting make it extremely difficult
    to do the kind of surveillance-based advertising that has made companies like
    Google and Facebook worth trillions of dollars. In fact, despite their immense
    scale, neither of the biggest ad-based platforms on the internet can enable you
    to buy ads on podcasts. In that way, podcasts have reintroduced the wonderful
    kind of advertising inefficiencies that we saw in the heyday of print magazines,
    where advertisers were hoping that some part of the audience would mail back one
    of those blow-in cards that used to be sandwiched into the binding of a magazine.
    (Kids, ask your grandparents.)

    apocryphal) line one would always hear is, "Half the money I spend on advertising
    is wasted; the trouble is I don’t know which half." But for creators, and for
    the world, that inefficiency was often wonderful. The inefficiency of old media
    formats resulted in less surveillance of the purchasing and behavioral habits
    of individuals, and larger surpluses that sustained a healthier, more vibrant
    media ecosystem that could even afford to invest in important stories or content
    despite the fact that they might not have a large audience.

- en: What podcasting holds in the promise of its open format is the proof that an
    open web can still thrive and be relevant, that it can inspire new systems that
    are similarly open to take root and grow. Even the biggest companies in the world
    can't displace these kinds of systems once they find their audiences. And that's
    not to say that there aren't shortcomings or problems with these systems, too.
    But, for example, when someone makes a podcast that's about encouraging hate,
    there's no one centralized system that can automatically suggest it to an audience
    and push them down a path of further radicalization.

- en: And of course, the winner-takes-all world of media being consumed by tech means
    that the economics of individual podcast production are often brutal now, sometimes
    simply *because* creators can't rely on outsourcing advertising sales to one of
    the big platforms. An open system isn't a panacea for all that's broken in the
    media ecosystem.

- en: But what we can take away from hearing "wherever you find podcasts" at the end
    of every episode we listen to is that, sometimes without us knowing, radical systems
    can survive and even thrive in the modern world of tech and media. They can inspire
    new creators to make similar systems that are unowned, uncentralized, and a little
    bit uncontrollable. And in this era where we're seeing [the renaissance of the
    open web](https://www.anildash.com/2024/01/03/human-web-renaissance/), they point
    the way toward a future where we can use the same tone to say "wherever you find
    news" or "wherever you find your friends online", and know that it means that
    there's a way that our lives online could be fully in our own control.
