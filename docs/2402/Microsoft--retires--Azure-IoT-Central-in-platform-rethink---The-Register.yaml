- en: IoT Hub is a cloud-based service that provides a "secure and scalable way to
    connect, monitor, and manage IoT devices and sensors," according to Microsoft.
    Azure IoT Edge is designed to allow devices to run cloud-based workloads locally.
    And Azure IoT Central is a fully managed, cloud-based IoT solution for connecting
    and managing devices at scale.

- en: Central is a layer above Hub in the architecture, and Hub itself may well continue.
    One developer told *The Register* there was no warning about Hub on the Azure
    console. [As for IoT Edge](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-edge/about-iot-edge?view=iotedge-1.4),
    it is "a device-focused runtime that enables you to deploy, run, and monitor containerized
    Linux workloads."
