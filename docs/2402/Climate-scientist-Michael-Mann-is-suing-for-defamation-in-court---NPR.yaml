    shows thousands of years of relatively stable global temperatures. Then, when
    humans start burning lots of coal and oil, it shows a spike upward. Mann's graph

    into his research. Penn State, [as well as the National Science Foundation](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/federal-investigators-clear-climate-scientist-michael-mann/),
