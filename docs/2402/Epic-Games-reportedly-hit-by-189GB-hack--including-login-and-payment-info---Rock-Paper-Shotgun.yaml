- en: The report comes from [Cyber Daily](https://www.cyberdaily.au/culture/10241-fortnite-game-dev-epic-games-allegedly-hacked),
    who also broke the news of [last year's confirmed hack attack on Insomniac Games](https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hackers-share-over-16-terabytes-of-insomniac-data-including-employee-personal-information).
    The site claims that new ransomware group Mogilevich are the culprits, as per
    the screencap of a darkweb posting above, and that the hackers are now trying
    to get Epic or another party to pay up for the return of the data, with a deadline
    of 4th March.

  zh: 报道来自[Cyber Daily](https://www.cyberdaily.au/culture/10241-fortnite-game-dev-epic-games-allegedly-hacked)，他们还曾报道[去年确认的对Insomniac
    Games的黑客攻击](https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hackers-share-over-16-terabytes-of-insomniac-data-including-employee-personal-information)。该网站声称新的勒索软件组织莫吉列维奇是罪魁祸首，正如上述黑网发布的截屏所示，而黑客现在正试图让Epic或其他一方支付以获取数据的返还，截止日期是3月4日。
- en: Epic, however, say that they've yet to see any proof that a ransomware attack
    has taken place. "We are investigating but there is currently zero evidence that
    these claims are legitimate," a spokesperson told [Eurogamer](https://www.eurogamer.net/epic-games-hacked-and-data-stolen-ransomware-group-claims)
    this morning. "Mogilievich has not contacted Epic or provided any proof of the
    veracity of these allegations.

  zh: 不过，Epic称他们尚未看到任何证据表明已发生勒索软件攻击。“我们正在调查，但目前没有证据证明这些声明是合法的，”一位发言人今早告诉[Eurogamer](https://www.eurogamer.net/epic-games-hacked-and-data-stolen-ransomware-group-claims)。“莫吉列维奇没有联系Epic或提供任何关于这些指控真实性的证据。
- en: '"When we saw these allegations, which were a screenshot of a darkweb webpage
    in [a Tweet from a third party](https://twitter.com/LawrenceAbrams/status/1762576389373325757?s=20),
    we began investigating within minutes and reached out to Mogilevich for proof,"
    the statement continues. "Mogilevich has not responded. The closest thing we have
    seen to a response is this Tweet, where they allegedly ask for $15k and ''proof
    of funds'' to hand over the purported data."'

    more. In the meantime, you might want to change your Epic Games Store password.
