    who also broke the news of [last year's confirmed hack attack on Insomniac Games](https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hackers-share-over-16-terabytes-of-insomniac-data-including-employee-personal-information).
    The site claims that new ransomware group Mogilevich are the culprits, as per
    the screencap of a darkweb posting above, and that the hackers are now trying
    to get Epic or another party to pay up for the return of the data, with a deadline
    of 4th March.

- en: Epic, however, say that they've yet to see any proof that a ransomware attack
    has taken place. "We are investigating but there is currently zero evidence that
    these claims are legitimate," a spokesperson told [Eurogamer](https://www.eurogamer.net/epic-games-hacked-and-data-stolen-ransomware-group-claims)
    this morning. "Mogilievich has not contacted Epic or provided any proof of the
    veracity of these allegations.

    in [a Tweet from a third party](https://twitter.com/LawrenceAbrams/status/1762576389373325757?s=20),
    we began investigating within minutes and reached out to Mogilevich for proof,"
    the statement continues. "Mogilevich has not responded. The closest thing we have
    seen to a response is this Tweet, where they allegedly ask for $15k and ''proof
    of funds'' to hand over the purported data."'

    more. In the meantime, you might want to change your Epic Games Store password.
    There's no such thing as being too careful.
