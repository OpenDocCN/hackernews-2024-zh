- en: Yale University will again require students to submit standardized test scores
    when they apply for admission, [school officials said Thursday](https://admissions.yale.edu/test-flexible).
    The change comes after officials found that the scores were the single best predictor
    of students’ academic performance and that not considering them could be a disadvantage
    for those who have already faced daunting challenges.
