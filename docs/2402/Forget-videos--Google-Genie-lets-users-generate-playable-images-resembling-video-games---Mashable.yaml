    at [Google](https://mashable.com/category/google) DeepMind have taken on the world's
    [highest grossing entertainment industry](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesagencycouncil/2023/11/17/the-gaming-industry-a-behemoth-with-unprecedented-global-reach/?sh=2dc89ba0512f
    "(opens in a new window)") by introducing something called "Genie." The new artificial
    intelligence system from Google researchers can create playable worlds resembling
    video games from images and text prompts. [Announced in a paper Friday](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15391
    "(opens in a new window)"), Genie is not available to the public yet.

    it's an "[actionable-controllable world model.](https://x.com/_rockt/status/1762027517693546816?s=20
    "(opens in a new window)")" Trained on over 200,000 hours of publicly available
    2D platformers that exist across the internet, Genie can take prompts, sketches,
    and other images and create virtual worlds for users to play around in — creating
    assets from scratch and generating pixels based on player actions.

    hundreds of hours of unsupervised training. This allows Genie to understand differing
    layers of game mechanics like player control, actions, and movement. Outside of
    developing 2D platformers, there could be potential use in the field of robotics
    to help train robots on how to navigate environments.

- en: While nowhere near the high image quality and polished presentation of Sora,
    Genie is an impressive generative AI. It also prompts questions about the future
    job security of video game developers and concerns for game marketplaces like
    Steam, already overwhelmed with spam games and asset flips.
