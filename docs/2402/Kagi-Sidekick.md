# Kagi Sidekick

## Kagi Sidekick (alpha)

Add fast search with Kagi smarts and AI to your personal or documentation website with just a couple lines of code.

We'll sort out the hard stuff - indexing, embeddings, vector search, and AI chat with your pages. Just integrate with two lines of code using our lightweight Web Components (20kB min+gzip) or our Docusaurus, Hugo, or VitePress plugins.

### What is the big idea?

We intend to offer Sidekick as a free service for small/personal websites and reasonably priced search option for commercial websites. The added benefit of using Kagi Sidekick is that your website will automatically (after opt-in) be indexed to show in Kagi search.

We are currently in the process of gauging demand for this service. Please

[register your interest](https://forms.gle/tiQVHpg7K2FBaK1w5)

and we'll notify you when it launches. You can also submit feedback in the

[Sidekick discussion thread](https://kagifeedback.org/d/3123-kagi-sidekick)
