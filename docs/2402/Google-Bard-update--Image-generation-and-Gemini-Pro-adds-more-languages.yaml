- en: Last December, we brought [Gemini Pro into Bard](https://blog.google/products/bard/google-bard-try-gemini-ai/)
    in English, giving Bard more advanced understanding, reasoning, summarizing and
    coding abilities. Today Gemini Pro in Bard will be available in [over 40 languages
    and more than 230 countries and territories](https://support.google.com/bard/answer/13575153?hl=en),
    so more people can collaborate with this faster, more capable version of Bard.

- en: The Large Model Systems Organization, a leading evaluator of language models
    and chatbots across languages, [recently shared](https://huggingface.co/spaces/lmsys/chatbot-arena-leaderboard)
    that Bard with Gemini Pro is one of the most preferred chatbots available (with
    or without cost), [noting](https://twitter.com/lmsysorg/status/1750921228012122526?s=20)
    that it has made a “stunning leap” forward. And blind evaluations with our third-party
    raters identified Bard with Gemini Pro as one of the top-performing conversational
    AIs, compared to leading free and paid alternatives.
