- en: But as cameras were being brought back online, users started seeing images and
    videos in their Events that were not from their cameras. When every device tried
    to come back online at once, the company explained, the system became overloaded.
    The increased usage caused device IDs to be mapped incorrectly, connecting some
    accounts to the wrong cameras. Wyze blamed "a third-party caching client library
    that was recently integrated into our system" for the trouble.

  zh: 但随着摄像头重新联机，用户开始在他们的事件中看到并不属于他们摄像头的图像和视频。公司解释说，当每个设备同时重启时，系统变得过载。增加的使用导致设备ID被错误地映射，将一些帐户连接到错误的摄像头上。Wyze指责"最近集成到我们系统中的第三方缓存客户端库"导致了这些问题。
- en: At first, Wyze estimated that only 14 people were able to peek into someone
    else's home. Now that estimate has ballooned to 13,000\. However, only 1,500 of
    those people enlarged a thumbnail or viewed a video. 99% of users weren't impacted
    at all, the company said, adding that they had already contacted affected users.

  zh: 起初，Wyze估计只有14人能够窥视到别人的家。现在，这一估计已经膨胀到13,000人。然而，只有1,500人放大了缩略图或观看了视频。公司称，99%的用户没有受到任何影响，并补充说他们已经联系了受影响的用户。
- en: That's a small number, but for those who were viewed without their consent,
    it's a pretty big deal. "We've identified your Wyze as one that was affected,"
    those users were told. "This means that thumbnails from your events were visible
    in another Wyze user's account and that a thumbnail was tapped." The email explained
    that most taps enlarged a thumbnail, but if it was a video event, the video was
    viewed.

  zh: 对于那些未经同意被查看的人来说，这是一个相当大的问题，尽管数量很少。"我们已确认您的Wyze设备受到影响，"这些用户被告知。"这意味着您事件的缩略图在另一个Wyze用户的帐户中可见，并且缩略图已被点击。"邮件解释说，大多数点击放大了缩略图，但如果是视频事件，则会观看视频。
- en: One Reddit user, a 23-year-old female, received the message that her camera
    had been viewed by someone else. She uses her camera to keep an eye on her sick
    animals while she's at work, she explained, but she was getting ready to leave
    for work during the outage, so she was almost certainly in frame. "I'm so disgusted
    and upset. I've already deleted my account, but I'm feeling so violated."
