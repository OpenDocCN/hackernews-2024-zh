    breach – because it may have let a stranger see in your home.

    issue began shortly after an outage on Friday morning, February 16\. If customers
    tried to view their cameras during that time, he wrote, images were unavailable.

- en: But as cameras were being brought back online, users started seeing images and
    videos in their Events that were not from their cameras. When every device tried
    to come back online at once, the company explained, the system became overloaded.
    The increased usage caused device IDs to be mapped incorrectly, connecting some
    accounts to the wrong cameras. Wyze blamed "a third-party caching client library
    that was recently integrated into our system" for the trouble.

- en: At first, Wyze estimated that only 14 people were able to peek into someone
    else's home. Now that estimate has ballooned to 13,000\. However, only 1,500 of
    those people enlarged a thumbnail or viewed a video. 99% of users weren't impacted
    at all, the company said, adding that they had already contacted affected users.

    it's a pretty big deal. "We've identified your Wyze as one that was affected,"
    those users were told. "This means that thumbnails from your events were visible
    in another Wyze user's account and that a thumbnail was tapped." The email explained
    that most taps enlarged a thumbnail, but if it was a video event, the video was
    viewed.

- en: One Reddit user, a 23-year-old female, received the message that her camera
    had been viewed by someone else. She uses her camera to keep an eye on her sick
    animals while she's at work, she explained, but she was getting ready to leave
    for work during the outage, so she was almost certainly in frame. "I'm so disgusted
    and upset. I've already deleted my account, but I'm feeling so violated."

    including a new layer of verification before users are connected to Event videos.
    The Wyze system was also modified to bypass caching on user devices until new
    client libraries are thoroughly stress-tested.
