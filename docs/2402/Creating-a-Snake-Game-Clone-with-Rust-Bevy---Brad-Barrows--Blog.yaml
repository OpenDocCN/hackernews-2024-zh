    Component System) architecture very easy and ituitive to use. Really the DI system
    is one of the most amazing Rust feats that I have seen so far.

    It describes some of the basic concepts of how the Bevy game engine works. Combined
    with a powerful dependency injection (DI) system, Bevy is powerful, easy to work
    with, and fun to use.

    me to, later on, using the DI/query system executed on each game loop, to find
    all the entities of a certain type and do something with them.

    tuple where I can provide multiple Components that make up whatever entity I am
    creating.

    system. With types and traits, I can query for all the entities of a certain type
    and do something with them each step of the game loop.

    remove them if the snake crashes. To move them I just need their Transform (part
    of what was provided from the MaterialMesh2dBundle during setup) and the Entity
    itself so I can send a command to despawn them or remove body parts from the game.

    be accomplished in Rust until someone from the Bevy Discord chat kindly pointed
    me to this documentation which breaks down [how it all works](https://promethia-27.github.io/dependency_injection_like_bevy_from_scratch/chapter1/system.html).
