    December in the [Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences USA](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2315722120).
    That study, using international demographic data for every country in the world,
    projected a 38 per cent global decline in living relatives for individuals aged
    65 by the year 2095, compared to 1950.
