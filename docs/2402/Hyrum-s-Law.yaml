- en: Over the past couple years of doing low-level infrastructure migrations in one
    of the most complex software systems on the planet, I’ve made some observations
    about the differences between an interface and its implementations. We typically
    think of the interface as an abstraction for interacting with a system (like the
    steering wheel and pedals in a car), and the implementation as the way the system
    does its work (wheels and an engine). This is useful for a number of reasons,
    foremost among them that most useful systems rapidly become too complex for a
    single individual or group to completely understand, and abstractions are essential
    to managing that complexity.

- en: Defining the correct level of abstraction is a completely separate discussion
    (see Mythical Man-Month), but we like to think that once an abstraction is defined,
    it is concrete. In other words, an interface should theoretically provide a clear
    separation between consumers of a system and its implementers. In practice, this
    theory breaks down as the use of a system grows and its users start to rely upon
    implementation details intentionally exposed through the interface, or which they
    divine through regular use. Spolsky’s “Law of Leaky Abstractions” embodies consumers’
    reliance upon internal implementation details.

- en: 'Taken to its logical extreme, this leads to the following observation, colloquially
    referred to as “The Law of Implicit Interfaces”: Given enough use, there is no
    such thing as a private implementation. That is, if an interface has enough consumers,
    they will collectively depend on every aspect of the implementation, intentionally
    or not. This effect serves to constrain changes to the implementation, which must
    now conform to both the explicitly documented interface, as well as the implicit
    interface captured by usage. We often refer to this phenomenon as "bug-for-bug
    compatibility."'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The creation of the implicit interface usually happens gradually, and interface
    consumers generally aren’t aware as it’s happening. For example, an interface
    may make no guarantees about performance, yet consumers often come to expect a
    certain level of performance from its implementation. Those expectations become
    part of the implicit interface to a system, and changes to the system must maintain
    these performance characteristics to continue functioning for its consumers.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'Not all consumers depend upon the same implicit interface, but given enough
    consumers, the implicit interface will eventually exactly match the implementation.
    At this point, the interface has evaporated: the implementation has become the
    interface, and any changes to it will violate consumer expectations. With a bit
    of luck, widespread, comprehensive, and automated testing can detect these new
    expectations but not ameliorate them.'

- en: Implicit interfaces result from the organic growth of large systems, and while
    we may wish the problem did not exist, designers and engineers would be wise to
    consider it when building and maintaining complex systems. So be aware of how
    the implicit interface constrains your system design and evolution, and know that
    for any reasonably popular system, the interface reaches much deeper than you
    think.

    naming it as "Hyrum's Law" and popularizing the concept more broadly.
