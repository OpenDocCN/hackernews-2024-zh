    To curb the population the government paid a bounty for dead cobras. This triggered
    entrepreneurs to start breeding cobras to collect the bounty. When the government
    figured out what was happening, they discontinued the bounty which meant all the
    cobras being bred were worthless and were thus set free, increasing the cobra
    population significantly.

    problem worse. And it happens more often than you might think. There are similar
    stories about incentives to [kill rats in Hanoi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Hanoi_Rat_Massacre),
    incentives to [reduce greenhouse gasses](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature.2015.18238),
    incentives to reduce [narcotic production](https://www.sigar.mil/pdf/lessonslearned/SIGAR-18-52-LL.pdf#page=56),
    and more.

    produce good outcomes. I heard a story from a friend in South Africa that their
    town had legalized the hunting of endangered rhinoceroses. This sounds like a
    shockingly bad idea. But they instituted a very large fee that a hunter would
    have to pay that would be split with the farmer whose land the rhino was on. Farmers
    who used to tip off poachers to get rhinos off their land would now aggressively
    defend the rhino against poachers. I don’t know how widespread the program was
    but my friend suggested that at least in the first few years the population increased
    meaningfully.

    captive in zoos and aquariums has increased enthusiasm for protecting animals
    in the wild. Safe injection sites reduce negative externalities of illegal drug
    use. Sex education reduces incidences of teen pregnancy.

    is unlimited data cell phone plans. Everyone thinks they want an unlimited data
    plan. But at the incentive level the goal for the carrier there is to give you
    the minimum level of service required just so you won’t switch carriers. Instead
    if you have a plan where you pay for data their incentive is to make your experience
    using data as fast and as great as possible so you are inclined to use more.

- en: “everyone should share feedback directly instead of through managers” leads
    to people either withholding valuable feedback to maintain relationships or damaging
    relationships if they can’t share such feedback elegantly. This is a job the manager
    is trained to do.

- en: “Let’s create a comprehensive description of what it takes to do each job at
    each level” leads to people only doing things that were written down rather than
    the common sense things that someone really at that level would naturally understand.
    The more comprehensive you attempt to make it the more trapped you are by it.
    The reason these things are vague is because all jobs of any meaning have tons
    of discretion and people are often only able to demonstrate they are at a certain
    level by how well they operate within that uncertainty. Almost by definition if
    you have to tell someone exactly what the job is then they aren’t there yet, outside
    of the most junior roles.

    deeply understand one another’s work leads to a lowest common denominator understanding
    of value creation. Things like organizational size or how much press something
    got become important features when in practice making big impact with a small
    team or doing important work that nobody sees are likely much more important to
    emphasize.
