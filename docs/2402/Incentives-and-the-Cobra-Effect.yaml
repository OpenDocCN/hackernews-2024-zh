- en: When Delhi was under colonial rule it suffered from an excess of venomous cobras.
    To curb the population the government paid a bounty for dead cobras. This triggered
    entrepreneurs to start breeding cobras to collect the bounty. When the government
    figured out what was happening, they discontinued the bounty which meant all the
    cobras being bred were worthless and were thus set free, increasing the cobra
    population significantly.

    problem worse. And it happens more often than you might think. There are similar
    stories about incentives to [kill rats in Hanoi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Hanoi_Rat_Massacre),
    incentives to [reduce greenhouse gasses](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature.2015.18238),
    incentives to reduce [narcotic production](https://www.sigar.mil/pdf/lessonslearned/SIGAR-18-52-LL.pdf#page=56),
    and more.

    produce good outcomes. I heard a story from a friend in South Africa that their
    town had legalized the hunting of endangered rhinoceroses. This sounds like a
    shockingly bad idea. But they instituted a very large fee that a hunter would
    have to pay that would be split with the farmer whose land the rhino was on. Farmers
    who used to tip off poachers to get rhinos off their land would now aggressively
    defend the rhino against poachers. I don’t know how widespread the program was
    but my friend suggested that at least in the first few years the population increased
    meaningfully.

    captive in zoos and aquariums has increased enthusiasm for protecting animals
    in the wild. Safe injection sites reduce negative externalities of illegal drug
    use. Sex education reduces incidences of teen pregnancy.

- en: We get caught in these traps all the time as consumers. My favorite example
    is unlimited data cell phone plans. Everyone thinks they want an unlimited data
    plan. But at the incentive level the goal for the carrier there is to give you
    the minimum level of service required just so you won’t switch carriers. Instead
    if you have a plan where you pay for data their incentive is to make your experience
    using data as fast and as great as possible so you are inclined to use more.

- en: “everyone should share feedback directly instead of through managers” leads
    to people either withholding valuable feedback to maintain relationships or damaging
    relationships if they can’t share such feedback elegantly. This is a job the manager
    is trained to do.

- en: “Let’s create a comprehensive description of what it takes to do each job at
    each level” leads to people only doing things that were written down rather than
    the common sense things that someone really at that level would naturally understand.
    The more comprehensive you attempt to make it the more trapped you are by it.
    The reason these things are vague is because all jobs of any meaning have tons
    of discretion and people are often only able to demonstrate they are at a certain
    level by how well they operate within that uncertainty. Almost by definition if
    you have to tell someone exactly what the job is then they aren’t there yet, outside
    of the most junior roles.

  zh: “让我们创建一个全面的描述，说明每个级别每个职位需要做什么”，导致人们只做写下来的东西，而不是那些真正在那个级别的人自然理解的常识性事务。你试图使其更为全面，结果你却被它所束缚。这些事情之所以含糊不清，是因为任何有意义的工作都充满了大量的自由裁量权，人们通常只能通过在不确定性中运作的能力来证明他们处于某个水平。几乎可以通过定义，如果你必须告诉某人工作确切是什么，那么他们还没有达到那个水平，除了最初级的角色。
- en: “Let’s cross calibrate against a wide set of other teams” when the teams don’t
    deeply understand one another’s work leads to a lowest common denominator understanding
    of value creation. Things like organizational size or how much press something
    got become important features when in practice making big impact with a small
    team or doing important work that nobody sees are likely much more important to
    emphasize.

  zh: “让我们与一组广泛的其他团队进行交叉校准”，当团队彼此不深入了解彼此的工作时，会导致对价值创造的最低公共理解。像组织大小或某事得到多少媒体关注之类的因素，在实践中，用小团队取得重大影响或者做一些重要工作，却无人关注，可能更加重要并值得强调。
