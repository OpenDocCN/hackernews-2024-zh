- en: I have had a long-standing interest in promoting employment as an essential
    element in building full and meaningful lives for autistic people. At the moment
    only 3 in 10 autistic people of working age are in employment. This means that
    7 in 10 of them are unable to access the independence and fulfilment that employment
    can bring. It also means that employers, and the wider economy, are missing out
    on the skills and energy that autistic people could be contributing, to the detriment
    of us all.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I was therefore delighted when the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions
    agreed to this review identifying the barriers to autistic people securing sustained
    and fulfilling employment and exploring how we can overcome those barriers. We
    launched the review on 2 April 2023, World Autism Awareness Day, and over the
    months since we have spoken to hundreds of organisations and individuals, and
    drawn all their experience, ideas and good practice into the report and recommendations
    you will find here.

- en: e.1 Autistica estimates that around 1 in 70 people is autistic, so about 1 million
    people in the UK. In 2022/2023 (the latest available figures) the number of people
    of working age in the UK who reported autism as either a main or secondary long-term
    health condition was 680,000\. Neurodiverse people do not consistently identify
    as having a long-term health condition therefore these numbers are likely to be
    an undercount of the true population. Not all working age autistic people will
    be able to work, but NAS’s research found that the vast majority want to.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: e.2 Despite their wish to work, the latest official statistics show that only
    around 3 in 10 working age autistic disabled people are in employment, compared
    with around 5 in 10 for all disabled people and 8 in 10 for non-disabled people.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: e.3 Autistic people face the largest pay gap of all disability groups, receiving
    a third less than non-disabled people on average. Autistic graduates are twice
    as likely to be unemployed after 15 months as non-disabled graduates, with only
    36% finding full time work in this period. Autistic graduates are most likely
    to be overqualified for the job they have, most likely to be on zero-hours contracts,
    and least likely to be in a permanent role.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: e.4 There is a wide range of potential barriers to work for autistic people;
    poor preparation by employers, unfair hiring practices, unclear processes and
    outdated attitudes all play a role. From a young age, autistic people are less
    likely than their peers to have the time, connections or support to seek out work-related
    experiences and career advisors are often poorly equipped to support autistic
    people. This has knock-on effects for later employment prospects.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: e.5 Autistic people have far more negative experiences of interviews, group
    tasks and psychometric tests. Autistic jobseekers must navigate vague, generic
    job descriptions, ambiguous interview questions and challenging sensory environments,
    often with an emphasis on social skills rather than job skills. Many feel they
    must mask their autistic traits to succeed.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: e.6 Even after finding work, maintaining long-term employment remains a challenge
    for autistic people. Many do not receive the necessary support or adjustments
    to enable them to fulfil their role in the face of inaccessible sensory and social
    environments. Many autistic adults are not aware of their legal rights around
    reasonable adjustments. Only around 35% of autistic employees are fully open about
    being autistic, with 1 in 10 not disclosing to anyone at work. For those who do
    disclose, the most common time to do so is after starting a job – highlighting
    a persistent and well-founded fear of discrimination during the recruitment process.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: e.7 Access to adjustments is still highly variable, with the onus usually on
    the autistic employee to identify and advocate for adjustments. Around one third
    of autistic employees felt unable to discuss their adjustment needs at all, and
    of those who did request adjustments, over a quarter were refused and more than
    1 in 10 found the adjustment was poorly implemented.

    to identify and implement adjustments for autistic people.

    consider how this situation can be improved. Over the summer of 2023 the review
    received views from employers, employer organisations, autistic people, autism
    charities, specialist support groups and other stakeholders. It explored how employers
    recruit, retain and develop autistic people, identifying barriers to this happening
    and developing effective ways to overcome those barriers, with the aim of significantly
    improving the autism employment rate over the next 5 years.

- en: e.11 There was a high level of consensus from all stakeholders about the best
    ways to address each of these issues. We have condensed their views into 19 recommendations,
    presented under the relevant theme. These recommendations are mostly aimed at
    changing employer behaviour and are for the multidisciplinary task group to take
    forward.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: e.12 As well as the specific recommendations, the report notes that many developments
    that can help autistic jobseekers are already under way. These include the new
    Universal Support programme, the review and reinvigoration of Disability Confident,
    Access to Work developments and systems improvements, and the launch of the Autistica
    Neurodiversity Employers Index. These will require some steering as they are developed
    to ensure the needs and lived experiences of autistic people are taken fully into
    account.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: e.13 The report notes that many of the changes employers could make that would
    help recruit, retain and develop autistic people would also benefit people with
    other types of neurodiversity and disability, and non-disabled people. Adopting
    a universal “inclusion by design” approach, so an autistic person need not disclose
    their autism to secure the support they need, could reduce the need for separate
    workplace adjustments and the stigma this can sometimes entail, as well as improving
    overall productivity and reducing costs.

    done all at once and everywhere. Instead, we are seeking to generate a wave of
    improvement: starting from ripples of good practice, building into small waves
    of change, and finally growing into a sea change in accepted good practice which
    any employer would both want to and be expected to follow. We recognise that this
    could take some years to follow through: this argues for the creation of a task
    group to carry on the work.'

    work experience during their time at school, and may not be able to cope with

- en: Data from the Office of National Statistics shows that autistic people have
    amongst the lowest employment rate of any disabled group in the UK. In the year
    2020/21 only around 26% of working age autistic people are in employment, compared
    to around half of disabled people generally and eight in 10 of the general population.
    (The latest data for 2021/22 shows a slight improvement but only to around 30%).
    Similarly, the Association of Graduate Careers Advisory Services report that just
    over a third (36.2%) of autistic graduates are in full-time employment, the lowest
    rate of all disabled groups. More generally, neurodivergent people are greatly
    under-employed, with those considered to have “severe or specific learning difficulties”
    or “mental illness or nervous disorders” also facing amongst the lowest employment
    rates across disability groups.

    financial stability, independence and overall quality of life. Many of the worst
    outcomes associated with unemployment and under-employment are rife across autistic
    people, including poverty, poor mental health, limited independence and harrowing
    suicide rates. Compared to almost any other disabled group, autistic people are
    less likely to report feeling happy, satisfied with their life or that “the things
    I do in life are worthwhile”.'

- en: 'For employers: Neurodiversity is a vital but too often under-utilised resource
    for employers across the private, public and voluntary and community sectors.
    We know that autistic people have certain strengths that can help them outperform
    their non-autistic peers, particularly those requiring attention to detail, focus
    and information processing. At an organisational level, autistic people introduce
    different ways of thinking and working. For complex tasks that involve problem
    solving or creative thinking, like developing new products or business strategies,
    a neurodiverse team is more likely to avoid cognitive biases, generate a wider
    range of ideas to consider and confer a competitive advantage over other organisations.'

    approximately £14.5 billion every year because autistic people are unemployed
    or otherwise unable to participate in the workforce. The Institute for Fiscal
    Studies predicts that changes to the labour market will be the “lynchpin” that
    determines the UK’s economic recovery from the pandemic. As our economy adjusts,
    many sectors are facing shortages in labour which are harming economic growth
    and disrupting voters’ lives. Approximately 1 in 10 people has a neurodevelopmental
    condition, while the Labour Force Survey indicates there are approximately half
    a million autistic people not in employment.'

    effective solutions to the problems of identifying and supporting existing autistic
