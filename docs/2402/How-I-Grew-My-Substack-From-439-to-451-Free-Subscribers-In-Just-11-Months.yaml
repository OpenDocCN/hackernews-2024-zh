    on Substack. And since I’m something of an expert on Substack growth, I figured
    I’d chime in. Because I’ve grown my Substack from 439 free subscribers to 451
    free subscribers in just 11 months.

    I gained 11 new subscribers in less than a year and I have the stats to prove
    it. You, too, can hit numbers like mine (1 new subscriber *per month*!) if you
    just follow these simple steps. *And* are in a financial situation that allows
    the kind of free time you’ll need to grow this bad boy. *And* are willing to put
    in a butt ton of hours on a project that, statistically speaking, won’t succeed.
    Okay, let’s dive in!'

    Writers come to me for advice all the time saying things like “Carlos, I just
    don’t get it. I wrote four Substack posts during my 9-month-long vacation in Turks
    & Caicos and yet I’ve only gained 3 new subscribers.” And I have to tell them,
    “Listen, buddy boy, you’re never going anywhere with those kinds of numbers. You
    have to post at least *twice* that often!” And then they look at me, crestfallen,
    their dreams of writerly success fading before their eyes.

    things in the Substack, too. So I take back what I said earlier about having a
    clear vision. The key to Substack growth is the exact opposite: *spray and pray!*'

    feed, it’s time consuming, mentally exhausting, and a great place to get harassed
    by the most heinous people on planet Earth. But that’s a small price to pay for
    occasionally meeting someone cool. So, in addition to my prolific newsletter posts
    (1.5x a month, need I remind you) I also frequently write, comment on, and restack
    Notes. AT LEAST once every two months (sometimes three months if I forget).

    all put tons and tons of hours worth of work into their projects. It’s also important
    to remember that plenty of non-successful people *also* put tons and tons of hours
    worth of work into their projects and failed anyway! Most people never make a
    living wage from creative pursuits because we live in a chaotic world governed
    by probability. So any success on this topsy-turvy stochastic planet is, in part,
    due to being at the right place at the right time, appealing to humanity’s notoriously
    fickle, ever-changing tastes at just the right moment, being born with Lebron
    James-like preternatural abilities, and the alignment of Mercury relative to Earth.
    And even if you have all of those things, working your whole entire ass off is
    (DUH) also a prerequisite.

    going to enjoy failing at! It’s the only way to overcome the psychological carpet
    bombing that is putting your heart and soul into your creative work only for it
    to FALL INTO THE VOID TIME AND TIME AGAIN! Or maybe it won’t this time! You’ll
    never know until you put WAY TOO MUCH FUCKING ENERGY into it! Good luck!

    I’ve achieved on Substack these past 11 months. I don’t know about you, but I’m
    feeling energized to put in even more work into my Substack in 2024\. I daresay,
    I may even hit 468 or even 479 subscribers by this same time next year!

    Now, I just want to be super, super, super clear – this post isn’t intended to
    bash any writers who have written about growing their platforms recently. If you’ve
    perused Substack over the past few weeks, you’ve likely come across a few of the
    pieces I poked fun at above. But I assure you, my intent is not to put other writers
    on blast. This was just a silly way for those of us who are on the other side
    of the growth equation to have a laugh and let off a little steam. For the record,
    I’ve actually found those posts about Substack growth to be both informative and
    inspiring, and I appreciate those writers sharing their insights.

    any successful person, for that matter) tells other people that they need to “work
    harder.” You mean I have to work hard? If only I’d thought of that! Here I was
    being a lazy sack of shit this whole time thinking that was the key to success.

    working their absolute, wordsmithing ass off. The only difference is that what
    they’re working their asses off on might be anything from writing books, to teaching,
    to raising children, to working a non-writing day job that pays the bills. Not
    everyone has the time or resources to devote to growing a platform — that’s just
    the reality of the world we live in — so attributing one’s own success to working
    hard, though undoubtedly true, never sits right with me. It’s like saying that
    to be a writer you need to drink water and remember to keep breathing oxygen.
    True, yes, but it hardly bears repeating.

    I saw in many of the posts I came across. And I know that wasn’t their intent,
    but the satirist in me tends to interpret people’s words in the least generous
    way possible if it means getting to make a little joke out of it.

    something of value to readers. And developing the writing skills to do that can
    take years. Many of the Substacks I see growing quickly are from authors with
    multiple books under their belts and decades of experience. And that does, of
    course, take *work*. So that I wholeheartedly agree with.

    to succeed. But I do think that embracing the randomness of life is freeing. You
    really do have to love the work for the sake of the work, and that’s one of the
    hardest things to do as a writer when you also want to, you know, make enough
    money to eat. But putting constant pressure on yourself doesn’t do a bit of good.

    own failures (okay, “failures” is too harsh. “Non-successes,” maybe?) when it
    comes to growing my Substack over the past year. A what *not* to do, if you will.
    The blame for why my Substack hasn’t grown as much as I might’ve liked it to lies
    squarely with me. Life got in the way. I got busy with [my book](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CF47Z8JG?maas=maas_adg_7C9BAC2EFA2585AA6123C15055227C59_afap_abs&ref_=aa_maas&tag=maas),
    and starting a new job, and thus my Substack went by the wayside for parts of
    the year.

    earlier for comedic effect) in less than a year and I'm grateful for that! I do
    intend to post more regularly and make a concerted effort to build community here
    in 2024, so hopefully I can stick to that (feel free to slide into my chats to
    hound me if you feel I’m not delivering on that).

    Substack that you can’t get elsewhere it's that A) I’m a satirist and therefore
    my writing is (hopefully) relatively funny and entertaining to read, and B) I’m
    sharing what I’m learning as I’m learning it. So, in that sense, this Substack
    is a journey we’re going on *together* as opposed to me just passing on advice.
    So if that sounds like your jam, come say hi! And if you’re already a subscriber,
    come say hi more often! I love discussing all things humor and writing and my
    chats, notes, and comments are always open.
