    accounting service. However, the accountants found themselves unable to carry
    out the task without it. Years of over-reliance on the software had eroded their
    expertise, and ultimately, they had to relearn their fixed-asset accounting skills.

    it was “smart” enough to track depreciation and produce reports for many tax and
    financial purposes. These are tasks that human accountants found very complex
    and tedious.
