- en: More still could be done—and arguably should be done—to encourage marriage financially.
    The Department of Defense, for instance, provides particularly generous benefits
    for married service members. Marriage in the military is a pathway to a bigger
    housing allowance, better health care for your partner and any children you have,
    and other benefits. The military does *not* provide these benefits to cohabiting
    couples, which sets it apart from the more laissez-faire approach practiced by
    many other federal agencies serving families. But the same incentive could be
    provided simply by giving *bigger* benefits, of various sorts, including a more
    generous child tax credit, to people who marry, without reducing benefits to those
    who don’t.

    The kinds of Americans who enlist in the military tend to be more marriage-minded.
    Nonetheless, after controlling for factors such as race, ethnicity, age, and education,
    the GSS data indicate that a military background among men strongly predicts being
