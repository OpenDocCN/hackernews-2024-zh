- en: How did we end up in this place? Thousands – maybe millions? – of developers
    sit in standup meetings daily and answer the same 3 questions (*“What did you
    do yesterday?”, “What are you going to do today?”, “Any blockers?”*).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Managers around the world blindly adopt the same standup meeting format, without
    critical thought to its usefulness. It is the meeting agenda version of *“you
    won’t get fired for buying IBM”*.

- en: Imagine you’re part of a soccer team, and your side advances towards the opponent’s
    goal. Each player is shouting, communicating with immediacy, collaborating on
    how to score…and suddenly the manager walks on to the pitch and says, *“OK, gather
    around! Where did you kick the ball yesterday? Where are you planning on kicking
    it today? Any blockers?”*
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We already know that a soccer team is constantly communicating verbally and
    visually, and each member is aware of the overall plan. And while it’s a somewhat
    reductive comparison, it’s worth pondering on exactly why it’s ridiculous to think
    that a soccer team would even need a special ceremony to force collaboration and
    team awareness.

    ball towards the goal at all. Hearing the answer, *“I worked on some stuff”* does
    not make users happy, it does not help the team learn about their users, and it
    certainly doesn’t make the business any money.

    a gross *“follow the worker, not the work”* model and miss the opportunity to
    build a continuous delivery and learning mindset. They reek of bad top-down management
    and progressively cause slow, big-batching activity.

    official Scrum guide has already [removed](https://scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html#daily-scrum)
    the 3 questions, our industry should consider eliminating them too.
