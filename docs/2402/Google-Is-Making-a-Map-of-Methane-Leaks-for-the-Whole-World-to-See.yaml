    start circulating the Earth 15 times a day next month. Google plans to have the
    data mapped by the end of the year for the whole world to see.

- en: The partnership between Google and the Environmental Defense Fund, which in
    March is expected to launch its satellite known as MethaneSAT, marks a new era
    of global climate accountability. [Methane](https://www.unep.org/news-and-stories/press-release/urgent-action-cut-methane-emissions-fossil-fuel-operations-essential#:~:text=Methane%20is%20a%20powerful%20greenhouse,agriculture%2C%20waste%20and%20fossil%20fuels.)
    is a potent greenhouse gas estimated to be responsible for nearly a third of human-caused
    global warming. Scientists say slashing methane emissions is one of the fastest
    ways to slow the climate crisis because methane has 80 times the warming power
    of carbon dioxide over a decade.

    Steve Hamburg, the EDF''s chief scientist and the project lead for MethaneSAT,
    told reporters. "The need to protect the climate has never been more urgent, and
    cutting methane emissions from fossil-fuel operations and agriculture is really
    the fastest way that we can slow the warming right now."'

    problem. The International Energy Agency has said [farming is the largest source
    of methane emissions](https://www.iea.org/reports/global-methane-tracker-2023/understanding-methane-emissions)
    from human activities, but the energy sector is a close second. Oil, gas, and
    coal operations are thought to account for 40% of global methane emissions from
    human activities. The IEA says focusing on the energy sector should be a priority,
    in part because reducing methane leaks is cost-effective. Leaking gas can be captured
    and sold, and the technology to do that is relatively cheap.

    That approach offers only a snapshot in time, and research took years to be published.

    Geo — the team behind platforms such as Google Maps and Street View — said mapping
    oil and gas operations was similarly challenging. The locations of wellheads,
    industrial pumps, and storage tanks can change quickly, so a map needs to be updated
    regularly. A satellite can meet that demand.

    and intersections from satellite imagery would be applied to oil and gas infrastructure.
    The map would be overlaid with data from MethaneSAT to shed light on the type
    of machinery most susceptible to leaks.

    of global oil and gas production promised to nearly eliminate methane leaks from
    their own operations this decade. At least 155 countries have also signed the
    Global Methane Pledge, which calls for a 30% reduction in emissions. The pledge
    was launched in 2021, but since then, [methane emissions have continued to rise](https://www.iea.org/reports/global-methane-tracker-2023).

    cracking down on methane emissions from fossil-fuel infrastructure. The [European
    Union's rules](https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_23_5776)
    went a step further by targeting oil and gas imports. Europe imports about 80%
    of its energy, including from the US. By 2027, those imports are expected to meet
    methane-emissions standards on par with Europe's.

    just a regulatory one," he said. "Achieving real results means that the government,
    civil society, and industry need to know how much methane is coming from where,
    who is responsible for those emissions, and how those emissions are changing over
    time. We need the data on a global scale."'
