    coal operations are thought to account for 40% of global methane emissions from
    human activities. The IEA says focusing on the energy sector should be a priority,
    in part because reducing methane leaks is cost-effective. Leaking gas can be captured
    and sold, and the technology to do that is relatively cheap.
