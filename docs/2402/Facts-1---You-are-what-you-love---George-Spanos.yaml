    their work from their emotional being. For me, work is part of life and it should
    be a meaningful one.

- en: I recently had a talk with a close colleague that had to do with working with
    emotion. Their thesis was that there is no place for emotional thinking and analysis
    when working. They insisted on saying that the analytical brain should be almost
    exclusively responsible for how we behave in a work environment.

    of, but I also find this mantra unsustainable.

- en: Firstly, let’s make clear that it’s unlikely that you’re good at something you
    don’t love. If you managed to do that, you’ve probably dedicated the hours to
    something that does not fulfill you. The goal is not happiness. It’s about fulfillment.
    After all, you have to do what you love. You *are* that, how can you be doing
    anything else?

- en: This belief steers me towards believing that there has to be a clear emotional
    foundation on how we work. To be great, to achieve things, and to provide, we
    have to convert emotions into outcomes. Rather than the analytical brain being
    the fuel, it seems it’s more of a catalyst.

- en: Emotion cannot be separate from work. It has to be a part of it. When working,
    you’re expressing yourself. You express beliefs, opinions, and strategies, world
    views. You cannot detach yourself completely from work. I doubt that you ever
    should.

- en: People around you are fully aware when you’re doing something for the sake of
    doing it. No, you’re not hiding it well enough. No, you don’t convince people
    that you’re having a great time, when you’re not. No one who pays careful attention
    to what they experience really believes that you’re doing great, while not loving
    what you do. Again, you might do ok. And ok can be fine. You have to decide if
    *“ok”* is enough for you.

    love, sure. After all, the positive feedback loop of “love” is a mandatory part
    of its survival over time.

- en: If you want to enjoy yourself when working, try doing something you love. It’s
    about extroversion. It’s about getting it out and sharing it. People do notice
    when you love what you do. The reimbursement is not always fair. Frankly, it usually
    isn’t. But at least you’re doing what you love and, for most people after a certain
    living standard, this is reimbursement enough.

- en: If you know what you love and are afraid to pursue to make a living out of this,
    stop doing that immediately. Everything else is just a compromise. And while compromise
    can be mandatory, it cannot constitute a permanent state of being. Compromise
    is a trap for more compromise. Go out and do what you love. This is who you are.
