Click on a slice to view the critical path. Each slice represents a function call; the longer the slice, the more time it took to execute this function. The critical path connects these slices in the order they were executed.

Click the play button to see exactly what the user sees in the app and to view which functions are called at any given moment.

Use your keyboard to navigate the trace viewer. Press W and S to zoom in and out, respectively. Use A and D to move left and right.
