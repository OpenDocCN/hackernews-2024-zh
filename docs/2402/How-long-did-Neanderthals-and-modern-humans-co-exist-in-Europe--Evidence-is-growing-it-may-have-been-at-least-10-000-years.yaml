    co-existed in western Eurasia 50–40,000 years ago has long captured the imagination
    of academics and the public alike.

    and, more recently, geneticists.

    of thousands of years of co-existence between the two groups of humans, to those
    seeing a much more rapid replacement of Neanderthals by *H. sapiens* – whether
    through the active or coincidental displacement of our cousins, or through outcompeting
    them for resources.

    relationship to other archaeological remains at the same site – such as stone
    and bone tools, animal remains and other finds. Connections between a particular
    species of human and finds from an excavation have often been assumed, only to
    be later found [spurious in a number of instances](https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.1709235114).

    dating – a technique that only works on organic remains up to about 50,000 years

    environment, or from museum conservation materials, can make dating finds from
    these sites extremely challenging.

    overlap or replacement without a robust chronology. There is also the matter of
    spatial scale. Does the persistence of Neanderthals after 40,000 years ago in
    southern Iberia, for example, represent a lengthy period of overlap and co-existence,
    or a [“last stand”](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jqs.3252)

    remains from both early 20th-century and more recent excavations in the cave,
    dating them to [around 45,000 years ago](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06923-7).
    The authors say that, when combined with [early dates of *H. sapiens* in France](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.abj9496)
    and a variety of dates for Neanderthals being present at 45,000 years around Europe,
    this allows a potential period of overlap between the two species lasting some
    10,000 years.

    in the horse family (equids). These teeth came from the same sediment levels as
    the human remains. The results place the people in a particularly cold snap around

    (LRJ). But it has been unclear whether these were made by Neanderthals or modern

    both Neanderthals and *H. sapiens*, over millennia. Materials can easily become
    mixed together and so, short of finding tools buried in a modern human grave,
    it is difficult to say who made them. Ranis does seem to have an advantage in
    this regard, though, as the levels containing the human remains and the LRJ tools
    were sealed together by a rockfall.

    heralded an important new hominin fossil, Ranis yielded only a few small fragments
    of bone that were recognisable as human. Some other small bone fragments were
    identified as belonging to hominins (the wider human family) using a technique
    known as [proteomics](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8473418/#:%7E:text=The%20word%20proteome%20was%20created,of%20the%20organism%20than%20genomics.)
    – the study of protein structures that are unique to genera and sometimes to species.
    This technique was also applied to the site’s fauna [in another companion paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-023-02303-6).

    case, mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) – confirmed the identification as *H. sapiens*.
    The mtDNA results link Ranis with other [Initial Upper Palaeolithic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initial_Upper_Paleolithic)

    recent genetic studies suggest the *H. sapiens* conducting these early forays
    into Europe appear to have themselves been [replaced by other *H. sapiens* populations](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-05726-0)

    of one hominin population by another may have to be extended to consider similar,
    subsequent events that have remained far less visible, because they all involved
    *H. sapiens*.
