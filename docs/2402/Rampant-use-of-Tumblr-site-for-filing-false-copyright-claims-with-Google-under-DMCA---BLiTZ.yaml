    and even members of terrorist groups are randomly taking services of ‘Reputation
    Management’ firms in getting existing content links from Google search engine
    removed by filing false copyright claim under the [US Digital Millennium Copyright
    Act](https://www.google.com/support/answer/1386831) (DMCA), while these firms
    use [Tumblr](https://www.tumblr.com/) for creating back-dated posts on this site
    for their attempted copyright claims. Everyday, hundreds of such false copyright
    claims are being filed with Google by ‘Reputation Management’ firms thus dodging
    algorithms or Google’s bots by presenting fake references to back-dated Tumblr
    posts.

    users to post content to personal blogs online. The company was founded in 2007
    and acquired by Yahoo in 2013\. Today, Tumblr hosts 277 million blogs and serves
    content to more than 500 million visitors. Because of its popularity, blogs hosted
    on Tumblr tend to rank highly in search engines, especially if they include specific
    keywords like an individual’s name. Tumblr offers an excellent service and gives
    users an easy way to publish their ideas and develop a following. On some occasions
    however, individuals misuse Tumblr by posting negative, false, copyrighted, or
    defamatory information on the Internet. If this has happened to you, here are
    several ways to remove Tumblr posts.

    option by engaging one or more reputation management firms which started filing

    Google had initially deindexed some of the Blitz links being misled by the false
    copyright claims, we Blitz lodged counterclaim, eventually all of those deindexed

    Google should totally blacklist Tumblr by flagging it as an untrustworthy source
    or the authorities concerned in the United States should impose heavy penalties
    on Tumblr for facilitating false copyright claimants. The third option is – Tumblr
    should make certain technical changes on its site, where no one can post any content
