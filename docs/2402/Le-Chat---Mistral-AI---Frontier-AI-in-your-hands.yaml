    from Mistral AI. It offers a pedagogical and fun way to explore Mistral AI’s technology.

- en: Le Chat can use Mistral Large or Mistral Small under the hood, or a prototype
    model called Mistral Next, designed to be brief and concise. We are hard at work
    to make our models as useful and as little opinionated as possible, although much
    remain to be improved! Thanks to a tunable system-level moderation mechanism,
    le Chat warns you in a non-invasive way when you’re pushing the conversation in
    directions where the assistant may produce sensitive or controversial content
    (see our [Terms of Service](/terms/#terms-of-use) to know more about our approach
    to moderation).

    mechanisms. Please contact our team if this is of interest.
