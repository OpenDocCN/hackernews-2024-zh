    thread](https://twitter.com/bswud/status/1711453152908873982). Basically I defend
    three ideas: first, Induced demand is not a useful idea. Second, infrastructure,
    including roads, is good, even if we become dependent on it. Third, transport
    (and the infrastructure that enables it) is a crucial way we get agglomeration,
    and roads are one good way of generating it. Roads are good, even though they
    have substantial downsides.'

    just be filled up with new traffic, and thus, this extra roadspace hasn’t done
    anything to relieve traffic congestion. This theory is known as ‘induced demand’.
    Strictly, it is false, and we shouldn’t let it stop us building more roads, as
    doing so would make us richer and happier. However, this doesn’t mean more roadspace
    is good in every location. In fact, there are many places, like residential streets
    and city centres, which may have too much driving.

    Pyongyang). People join long queues before bakeries daily, and still only average
    half their calorie needs. The supply of bread then improves so that they average
    60% of their calorie needs instead. Would we really expect the queues to wither
    away? Of course not. They might not even get discernibly shorter. Does this mean
    that demand for bread is in some peculiar and distinctive sense ‘induced’? Of
    course not. Does it mean that going from 50% to 60% of calorie needs is not an
    improvement? Again, of course not.

    do have tolls or road pricing it’s hard for those running the roads to charge
    you prices that fully reflect this benefit you get, since they can only charge
    you for the trips you *do* take, which means that the value these options create
    is usually ‘captured’ not by infrastructure operators, but by house prices, because
    people pay more to live near infrastructure which offers lots of potential.
