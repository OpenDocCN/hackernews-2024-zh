- en: (InvestigateTV) — It’s been one year since [a train derailment in Ohio](https://www.cleveland19.com/2024/02/01/east-palestine-1-year-later-part-1-crisis-starts-with-spark/)
    thrust the issue of rail safety back into the national spotlight. Congressional
    lawmakers immediately introduced legislation designed to protect Americans and
    hold rail companies accountable. But the longest-serving woman in Congressional
    history says little has changed since the disaster.

    talked about the ripple effects of the massive incident that forced the evacuation
    of more than 1,000 people last February. The evacuation came after a Norfolk Southern
    train carrying hazardous materials derailed in eastern Ohio near the Pennsylvania
    border, with toxic chemicals contaminating the air, water, and soil all around
    the area.

    rail network even safer. The industry is dedicated to advancing safety through
    our own initiatives and in collaboration with policymakers. Despite some allegations,
    railroads have never been opposed to the Railway Safety Act (RSA) and have had
    open, productive conversations with policymakers including Rep. Kaptur’s staff.”
