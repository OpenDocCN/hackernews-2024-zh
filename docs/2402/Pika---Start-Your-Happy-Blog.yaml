    As they say, *if you’re not paying, you’re the product.* To that end, you can
    start blogging on Pika right away for free for up to 50 full blog posts, but unlimited
    blogging will eventually need a paid subscription.

    indie software made with expertise and care. In return, we’ll never sell your
    data or slap an obnoxious ad on your blog.
