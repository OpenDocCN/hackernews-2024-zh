    really, I live in Southern California) to kick off our roundup. A full [46% of
    Americans did not finish a book last year](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/01/05/how-many-books-did-you-read-2023-see-how-you-stack-up/)
    and 5% more read just one, so if you read two books you’re in the top half of
    American readers. If you read more than fifty, congrats you’re a book one per-center!
    Meanwhile, 42% read on paper, 22% digital, and 19% audiobooks, with e-books attracting
    the heaviest readers.

    obscured how they categorize the genres, [a quite robust 12% of readers read literary
    fiction](https://countercraft.substack.com/p/who-is-reading-what-and-why)–the
    same as the number that read science fiction and more than the 11% who read romance–puncturing
    some of the “we write books people actually read” sneers among certain genre enthusiasts.

    and wrote, quite accurately, “You might wonder if Goodreads isn’t just an enabler
    of scandal but the problem itself” and declares “[Goodreads is broken](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/24/opinion/goodreads-books-reviews.html).”
    I would add: Goodreads has *been* broken. This has been going on for years and
    years. Maris is right. We all deserve better, Goodreads and Amazon.'
