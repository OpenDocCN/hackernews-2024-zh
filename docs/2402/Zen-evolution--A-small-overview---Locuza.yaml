    chip smaller by any significant amount, as this design is pad (I/O PHY) limited.

    that Intel increased the ROB to 352 with Sunny Cove (from 224 on Skylake) and
    to a fairly massive size of 512 with Golden Cove.
  id: totrans-split-64

    aggressively, though the company will likely strive for a balanced point, keeping
    the perf/mm² high, as the generations before.
