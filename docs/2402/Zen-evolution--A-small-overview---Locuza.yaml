    August, but fate shut down Twitter in several countries so I couldn't publish
    it.

    public.

    and a few total guesses ( :> ) quite a bit of interesting data can be compared
    against each other.

- en: Starting with Zen 1, we have a monolithic SoC design made by Global Foundries
    in 14/12 nm.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The chip size is about 212 mm² and integrates two 4-core CCX together with multiple
    I/O devices for PCIe, USB and the Infinity Fabric.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The transistor density for the whole SoC was at ~23 MTr/mm².
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: After that, AMD went for a chiplet design, manufacturing a Core Complex Die
    at TSMC’s N7 node, while the I/O functions (the PHYs scale little to none with
    a new node) were separated as a cheaper 12 nm die at Global Foundries.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: With this change, we see a stark contrast when comparing both dies and the predecessor.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The 76 mm² core dies achieved 50 MTr/mm², 121% better transistor density compared
    to the monolithic design of Zen 1, while the I/O die is only at 16.72 MTr/mm²,
    26% worse than the Zen 1 SoC.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Zen 3 uses the “same” chiplet design and I/O die, but introduced new N7 CCDs
    with new CPU Cores, which were a bit larger, leading to a CCD size of ~ 84 mm²
    with basically the same transistor density.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The upcoming Zen 4 Raphael package is once again deploying the same chiplet
    design, but shrinking both chips with a new node.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The CCDs make the move from N7 to N5, achieving 91.3 MTr/mm², an increase of
    83% compared to the predecessor.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If one would exclude the I/O PHYs and other analog components, it’s likely true
    that AMD achieved a 2x transistor density improvement vs. the previous node.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The new I/O die went from 12nm Global Foundries to 6 nm (N6) TSMC.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Even though the transistor shrinkage is massive, the new I/O die is pretty much
    as large as before.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There are a couple of potential reasons for that.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Analog devices, as they are used for I/O PHYs, do not scale well with new nodes.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The current 12 nm design already has all chip edges fairly well occupied with
    I/O.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One could redesign the PHYs to take less horizontal space and go further into
    the die, but this can be challenging and not desired.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If one would shrink down the current design, you probably would not make the
    chip smaller by any significant amount, as this design is pad (I/O PHY) limited.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: What would shrink massively is the green portion in the middle, which would
    also lead to a lot of unused area.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: However, you could integrate new features for “free”.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And this is what AMD has done, the I/O die now includes an RDNA2 iGPU with one
    WGP (128 Shaders) running at up to 2.2 GHz (~564 FP32 GFLOPs).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Enough to drive the display, simple applications and to capture a section of
    the business market, which previously was not accessible.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Besides the small iGPU, a VCN engine for video de/encoding will also be incorporated,
    together with a necessary display engine and its display PHYs.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Lastly, the 6 nm node should in general lead to better energy efficiency for
    the logic and SRAM devices.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In regard to the core design, AMD has always touched on several aspects with
    each generation
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Zen 1 and 2 share the same microarchitecture foundation and as such are very
    familiar, using 4-core CCXes and logically a similar execution body.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But due to the 7 nm shrink, many structures on Zen 2 could be enlarged, some
    of them massively.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A new TAGE predictor has been added, branch target buffers have been (almost)
    doubled and the FPU width increased from 128 bits to 256 bits for single cycle
    AVX256 execution.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In addition, the L3 cache capacity per CCX was doubled.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It obviously goes on and on, for example multiple registers/buffers have been
    increased, like the re-order buffer to extract more ILP from the instruction stream,
    the Integer Register File got a few more entries and various scheduling queues
    for the execution units and load/store memory system.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Besides simple structure enlargements, AMD has rebalanced some aspects like
    the size of the L1 instruction cache and the op-cache capacity.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The company halved the L1I$ capacity to double the Op$ storage size, to source
    more
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: data from the latter, the more efficient and wider path, than the legacy L1I$/decode
    path.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Zen 3 changed key aspects of the microarchitecture and set a new design foundation
    while using the same 7nm node.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Gone is the three level BTB structure in favor of just two levels with zero-bubble
    execution for the first level.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The execution body got wider and the port design was changed.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: On a high-level you mostly see the expected scheme, several structure sizes
    have been slightly increased
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Besides changing many core attributes, another highlight of Zen 3 was the change
    from 2x CCXes, with separate L3 caches and round-trips to the I/O die, to a single
    CCX design with a unified L3 cache structure serving all 8 cores.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Zen 4 is pretty much a supercharged Zen 3 core, not unlike how Zen 2 was designed
    compared to Zen 1.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The same underlying microarchitecture is used while several structures are upgraded
    with the increased transistor budget of the 5nm process.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The width of the front-end was kept and follows us now since 4 generations.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As before, we have a 4-wide legacy decode path and a 6-wide dispatch to the
    execution engine.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: However, the branch prediction part has always been improved and Zen 4 makes
    no exception here.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The BTBs have been increased yet again, and like with Zen 2, more emphasis has
    been placed on the Op$ path, increasing the capacity from 4K to 6.75K.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The execution body is the same as on Zen 3 previously (width + port design).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So we are still looking at 4x INT pipes, 3x AGUs and an FPU with 2x FADD and
    2x FMUL(FMA) pipes (+ other pipes).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Similar to Zen 2, which poured a good chunk of its transistor budget into the
    FPU, Zen 4 again invests heavily in the FPU.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It’s now supporting AVX512 and a wide range of new instructions.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Moreover, for the first time after Zen 1, the amount of FP registers got increased
    by a decent amount.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As usual, you will also see many other structures being increased, like the
    re-order buffer holding now 320 entries (+25%).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In that regard, AMD is increasing that aspect still fairly conservatively, considering
    that Intel increased the ROB to 352 with Sunny Cove (from 224 on Skylake) and
    to a fairly massive size of 512 with Golden Cove.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: With Zen 5 AMD will widen the front-end and potentially increase the ROB more
    aggressively, though the company will likely strive for a balanced point, keeping
    the perf/mm² high, as the generations before.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Well, relative to Intel one might say, it’s all relative.
