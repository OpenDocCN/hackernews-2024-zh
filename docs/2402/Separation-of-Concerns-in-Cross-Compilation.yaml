- en: Managing complex C++ projects across multiple platforms often ends up being
    a frustrating and time-consuming task. However, this common challenge faced also
    by the most experienced software developers doesn‚Äôt have to be an inevitable struggle.
    Imagine a world where cross-compilation is not just feasible, but also efficient
    and less cumbersome. I have noticed in several past friendly discussions with
    other engineers that many are not at all familiar with the type of Separation
    of Concerns that Nix didn‚Äôt invent but also uses.
