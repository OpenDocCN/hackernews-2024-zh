    issues about work and family…. As I read this book, I really felt you were compelled
    to write it. So, what do you find compelling about this topic?'

- en: '**Stewart D.** **Friedman:** There’s both a personal reason and a professional
    one. I originally got into this topic area when my first son was born, now 26
    years ago. When I met him for the first time, I was overwhelmed by a question
    that I just couldn’t get out of my head: “What am I going to do to make the world
    a safe place for him to grow up in?” This is a question that I hadn’t really thought
    much about before I met him, but I couldn’t stop thinking about it. When I got
    back into my Wharton classroom about a week later, I framed the question in a
    slightly different way for the students, the future business leaders of the world:
    How are you thinking about the development, not so much of talent in the next
    generation, but of people? What does that mean for you professionally as well
    as personally, and how are you going to figure out how to do that in your own
    world?'
  prefs: []

- en: That created quite a stir in the classroom. First of all, they had prepared
    a case on motivation and reward systems, and I had put that aside for the day.
    They weren’t very happy about that. But some people were quite upset about the
    fact that I was talking about family and kids. Others were upset because they
    didn’t really want to hear about my personal life. But quite a few were really
    grateful and interested in the questions that I was challenging them with as I
    just started to rant on this issue, completely unprepared.

    do. Why don’t you tell us, since you are the professor?” That began a conversation
    with students, alumni, business leaders and government officials all over the
    world that [has lasted] for almost three decades. It started as a very personal
    question for me, but it very soon became one that I could see was important to
    my students, our school, our businesses and our society. I began a research program
    to try to answer some of those questions.

    We [started with] the Class of 1992 undergrads. Almost all of them responded to
    hundreds of questions about their lives, their careers, their values, their aspirations,
    their hopes and their dreams. Twenty years later, we asked the same questions
    of the Class of 2012 and went on to explore what we could discover about how things
    have changed.'

    children or planning to have children has changed so much and how it’s different
    for men and for women. The conversation has changed. New voices have entered the
    conversation. There are new norms evolving among young people and senior people
    about how to integrate the different parts of life in a way that work. When I
    first started asking these questions, it was very strange to be a man asking questions
    about work and family. It was almost all women exploring that question. But being
    a man at Wharton talking about families and kids, it made me kind of different
    and strange. I got a lot of attention as a result, just because of who I was,
    not so much what I was doing in terms of the quality of it. That brought a lot
    of interest in what we were doing here at Wharton. It’s something that the school
    was highly supportive of, being in the vanguard of interest in this topic.'

- en: Now, how is it that it’s become difficult for some people to talk about this?
    I think the most challenged audience would be business leaders and social policy
    makers because what we observe in the data is that people’s attitudes and values
    have changed but our social institutions, our government policies and our business
    practices have not. They are still built around a model of family that has a single
    earner with a mom at home taking care of the kids. That’s just not the norm anymore.
    It’s most challenging for those people who have the most responsibility for thinking
    about the direction of those institutions.

    on family. That’s the general trend there. At the same time, more men who are
    interested in becoming fathers are interested in being more involved as fathers.
    They don’t see themselves as the sole bread winner anymore. In 1992, the men in
    that era were still of a mindset that was pretty traditional. But today’s men,
    we don’t see that. They expect their spouses to be engaged in careers full time.
    Men and women also expect to be working a lot more hours. The average number of
    expected hours per week has gone from 58 hours per week in 1992 to 72 in 2012\.
    That’s 14 hours more per week.'

    family. That’s one of the big inhibitors of their willingness to commit to being
    parents because they don’t see how they can do it. In addition, to the extent
    that they carry a lot of student debt, that’s another factor that constrains men
    in their willingness to think about the prospect of having children. It’s not
    that they don’t want it — although that has gone down some — it’s, “How do I make
    it happen in light of all these new pressures?”

    That had a profound impact on them and the Class of 1992\. This came through very
    powerfully in the interviews that we did. But in addition, as has been noted by
    many people studying the Millennial generation, they are much more mobile, much
    less committed to organizations. The Class of 2012 entered college as the Great
    Recession hit. Their sense of insecurity about their economic futures is particularly
    acute. All those factors lead them to be more interested in moving faster into
    career tracks that are going to give them security.'

    the things that really stood out to me was this change in perception among young
    women as they are leaving college. It used to be considered selfish to want a
    career, right? Now they feel like it’s selfish to want children. In the conversations
    that you are having with them, how do they deal with that kind of perception,
    that kind of sentiment?'

    that more people, women and men, are willing and able to say, “I don’t want to
    have children.” For women especially, I see this as a kind of social progress
    in human evolution. In every generation prior to the current one, women have been
    normatively sanctioned to think of themselves as mothers. There’s almost a mindless
    march into motherhood throughout history. That question hasn’t really been raised.
    Today, young women are saying, “I don’t feel a need to do that.”'

    support from their organizations and from our society, they can’t figure out how
    to make it work. But then there are those who are choosing not to and for good
    reasons. They don’t want it. I see this as progress that people are able to choose

    the key is making flexibility real and using the power of digital communications
    — technology — to enable real flexibility in terms of where, when and how work
    gets done. Most importantly, today in 2013, [we should] make heroes of the people
    who are successful in figuring out new models for how to get work done. That is
    going to help us overcome the stigma of flexibility, which a number of researchers
    — Joan Williams, Shelley Correll and others — are writing about and demonstrating
    is still very, very real for men and for women [who take] flexible work options.
    It’s stigmatized in most organizations. You have to overcome that by demonstrating
    that flexibility works. The best way to do that is to tell individual stories
    of people who are successful in both their work and in the rest of their lives,
    whatever matters most to them, whether it’s family or social issues or religious
    — whatever it is. It’s not just about kids.'
