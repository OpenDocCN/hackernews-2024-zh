- en: '**Stewart D.** **Friedman:** There’s both a personal reason and a professional
    one. I originally got into this topic area when my first son was born, now 26
    years ago. When I met him for the first time, I was overwhelmed by a question
    that I just couldn’t get out of my head: “What am I going to do to make the world
    a safe place for him to grow up in?” This is a question that I hadn’t really thought
    much about before I met him, but I couldn’t stop thinking about it. When I got
    back into my Wharton classroom about a week later, I framed the question in a
    slightly different way for the students, the future business leaders of the world:
    How are you thinking about the development, not so much of talent in the next
    generation, but of people? What does that mean for you professionally as well
    as personally, and how are you going to figure out how to do that in your own
    world?'

  zh: '**斯图尔特·D. 弗里德曼：** 这既有个人原因，也有专业原因。26年前，我的第一个儿子出生时，我最初涉足这个话题领域。当我第一次见到他时，我被一个问题淹没，这个问题我简直就是摆脱不了：「我要做什么让这个世界成为他成长的安全之地？」在之前遇到他之前，我其实并没有多想过这个问题，但我却无法停止思考。大约一周后回到我的沃顿课堂时，我用稍微不同的方式向学生们提出了这个问题，未来的商界领袖们：你们如何思考发展，不仅是下一代的才华，而是人？这对你们在专业上和个人上意味着什么，你们将如何在自己的世界中解决这个问题？'
- en: That created quite a stir in the classroom. First of all, they had prepared
    a case on motivation and reward systems, and I had put that aside for the day.
    They weren’t very happy about that. But some people were quite upset about the
    fact that I was talking about family and kids. Others were upset because they
    didn’t really want to hear about my personal life. But quite a few were really
    grateful and interested in the questions that I was challenging them with as I
    just started to rant on this issue, completely unprepared.

- en: They turned the question around to me and said, “Well, I don’t know what to
    do. Why don’t you tell us, since you are the professor?” That began a conversation
    with students, alumni, business leaders and government officials all over the
    world that [has lasted] for almost three decades. It started as a very personal
    question for me, but it very soon became one that I could see was important to
    my students, our school, our businesses and our society. I began a research program
    to try to answer some of those questions.

    for men and for women. The conversation has changed. New voices have entered the
    conversation. There are new norms evolving among young people and senior people
    about how to integrate the different parts of life in a way that work. When I
    first started asking these questions, it was very strange to be a man asking questions
    about work and family. It was almost all women exploring that question. But being
    a man at Wharton talking about families and kids, it made me kind of different
    and strange. I got a lot of attention as a result, just because of who I was,
    not so much what I was doing in terms of the quality of it. That brought a lot
    of interest in what we were doing here at Wharton. It’s something that the school

    I think the most challenged audience would be business leaders and social policy
    makers because what we observe in the data is that people’s attitudes and values
    have changed but our social institutions, our government policies and our business
    practices have not. They are still built around a model of family that has a single
    earner with a mom at home taking care of the kids. That’s just not the norm anymore.

    They don’t see themselves as the sole bread winner anymore. In 1992, the men in
    that era were still of a mindset that was pretty traditional. But today’s men,
    we don’t see that. They expect their spouses to be engaged in careers full time.
    Men and women also expect to be working a lot more hours. The average number of
    expected hours per week has gone from 58 hours per week in 1992 to 72 in 2012\.

- en: But most importantly, young men today expect more conflict between work and
    family. That’s one of the big inhibitors of their willingness to commit to being
    parents because they don’t see how they can do it. In addition, to the extent
    that they carry a lot of student debt, that’s another factor that constrains men
    in their willingness to think about the prospect of having children. It’s not

    powerfully in the interviews that we did. But in addition, as has been noted by
    many people studying the Millennial generation, they are much more mobile, much
    less committed to organizations. The Class of 2012 entered college as the Great

    pursuit of what I call “four-way wins” — small actions that you can take that
    demonstrably improve your work, your home, your community and yourself. By trying
    to do that in the laboratory of our course, you develop new insights about what’s
    possible in terms of how to integrate the different parts of your life in a way
    that works for all of them. By practicing that and seeing what’s possible — usually
    what people discover is that they have more control and more of a sense of agency
    and capacity to bring the different parts together — they realize that they can
    do that as they grow in different parts and different stages of their career.

  zh: 人们进行实践和发展这种思维方式的实验是追求我称之为“四赢”（four-way wins）的东西——你可以采取的小行动，可以证明这些行动明显改善了你的工作、你的家庭、你的社区和你自己。通过在我们课程的实验室中尝试这样做，你会对如何整合生活的不同部分有新的见解，使它们可以同时发挥作用。通过练习并看到可能性——通常人们发现的是，他们能够在不同的生活部分和不同阶段成长时将不同的部分结合起来——他们意识到，他们可以在自己的价值观与行动之间找到平衡，以满足他们关心的周围人。

    resonates with me as I think about managing boundaries and integrating life, is
    the double dutch metaphor: You can actually jump two ropes at once. You point

    that you have to sacrifice everything in order to be successful in your career.
    What I have seen time and time and time again in my own life and in the people
    that I study and work with and consult with is that people are more successful
    in their careers to the extent that they don’t divest [themselves] of the rest
    of their lives — their families, their communities, their personal lives, their
    mind, body and spirit. In fact, they are more successful in their careers to the
    extent that they invest in those other parts. There’s mutual gain to be had. These
    two executives are just two of many examples that I’ve been studying and that
    I’ll be writing about in another book next year.'

    not true. Now, that’s not to say that sacrifices aren’t needed and that there’s
    no pain and disappointment. Of course, we all face that. Because men and women
    are now more aligned in their views about what it takes to make life work, especially
    dual-career relationships, we’re seeing a lot more experimentation, a lot more
    working together — men and women, private and public partnerships — to create
    models that are different from the ones that you and I grew up with and demonstrate
    that it doesn’t have to be a zero-sum game. There are different models of career

- en: '**Friedman:** It’s such an important question. For organizational leaders,
    the key is making flexibility real and using the power of digital communications
    — technology — to enable real flexibility in terms of where, when and how work
    gets done. Most importantly, today in 2013, [we should] make heroes of the people
    who are successful in figuring out new models for how to get work done. That is
    going to help us overcome the stigma of flexibility, which a number of researchers
    — Joan Williams, Shelley Correll and others — are writing about and demonstrating
    is still very, very real for men and for women [who take] flexible work options.
    It’s stigmatized in most organizations. You have to overcome that by demonstrating
    that flexibility works. The best way to do that is to tell individual stories
    of people who are successful in both their work and in the rest of their lives,
    whatever matters most to them, whether it’s family or social issues or religious
    — whatever it is. It’s not just about kids.'

    students and alumni to continue to track their values and their interest in the

    thousand students at all levels — both MBA and undergrad — who are really eager
    to help use this research as a platform and as a catalyst for creating a new kind
    of conversation on our college campus and on other college campuses to invite
    young men and women to start to talk about what these issues mean for them now.
    It’s clear that the sooner we engage in real conversation … the much more likely
