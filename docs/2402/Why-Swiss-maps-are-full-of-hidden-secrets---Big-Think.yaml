    Trends [lists *zero* occurrences](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=all&geo=DK&q=Swiss%20humor)
    of the phrase between 2004 and now. Even “German humor” produces a graph (albeit
    a rather flat one). But not only is there some evidence that Swiss comedy does
    exist, it might just be that being well-hidden is kind of its thing. Find it and
    laugh. Or don’t, and the joke’s on you!

    National Topography, [Swisstopo](https://www.swisstopo.admin.ch/) for short, is
    a decidedly serious institution. Many serious things — time and money, for starters
    — depend on the accuracy of its maps. In the case of its mountain maps, actual
    lives hang in the balance. Yet in decades past, the austere institute’s maps have
    served as the canvas for a series of in-jokes among its more fun-loving cartographers.

    duties included checking the maps before publication. Over the years, the cartographers
    managed to slip in — on maps that were supposed to contain only dry topographic
    facts — drawings of an airplane, a fish, a marmot, a mountaineer, a face, a spider,
    even of a naked lady. Once discovered, these humorous additions were removed without
    pardon. At least, that’s how it used to be.

    Its [map page](https://map.geo.admin.ch/) allows you not just to zoom in and out
    of the most recent maps but also to browse historical maps and thus revisit these
    “Easter eggs” that prove, however obliquely, the existence of a sense of humor
    among the mountains of Switzerland.

    map of Kloten, the international airport of Zürich. While it may seem only natural

    maps.

    offending craft was erased. However, the plane reappeared on the 2007 map at exactly
    the same spot – the tarmac before Gate A – only to vanish again in 2013.

    for the longest-lasting one, is the Naked Lady of Künten. First appearing on the
    topographical map of 1954, the reclining figure wasn’t discovered until 2012\.
    Admittedly, without head, arms and feet, she is hard to spot. Her odalisque-like
    forms are suggested by the curvature of a stream and an elongated green patch
    indicating vegetation.

    to right again in the 2013 edition of the local map. But it’s still easy to see
    how that particular distribution of topographic features could have inspired a
    lonely 1950s cartographer to pencil in something that wasn’t there.

    to provide, so he found a creative way to plug the gap. Topography, like nature,
    also abhors a vacuum, apparently.
