- en: AWS limits outgoing internet bandwidth on EC2 instances to 5Gbps. This means
    that the highest bandwidth that fck-nat can support (while remaining cost-effective)
    is 5Gbps. This is enough to cover a very broad set of use cases, but if you need
    additional bandwidth, you should use Managed NAT Gateway. If AWS were to lift
    the limit on internet egress bandwidth from EC2, you could cost-effectively operate
    fck-nat at speeds up to 25Gbps, but you wouldn't need Managed NAT Gateway then
    would you? fck-nat.

    be for you. Although fck-nat supports a high-availability mode, it is not completely
    immune to outages (albeit very rare). If your workload requires five 9s of uptime,
    then Managed NAT Gateway is likely a better option for you.

    as easy, secure, and configurable as possible. While fck-nat strives to provide
    out-of-the-box options and guides that work for most people, everyone's requirements
    are different. Where fck-nat can't provide a ready-to-use solution, we try to
    offer you all the toggles you need to get up and running yourself with as little
    headache as possible. We follow the "batteries included, but swappable" philosophy.

    the Packer files we use to build the public images inside the `packer` folder.
    Our Packer configuration uses variables extensively, allowing you to customize
    your base image, build region, architecture, etc. If the publicly available AMIs
    don't suit your needs, or you would prefer to host the AMIs yourself, you can
    create your own `pkrvars.hcl` file and build your own AMI.
