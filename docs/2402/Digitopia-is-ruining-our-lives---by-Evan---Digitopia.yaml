- en: Digitopia is not a well-known term because, well, I made it up. I wanted to
    find a way to group all the suffering I've experienced under one umbrella and,
    since certain parts of technology were the main drivers, I've decided to combine
    the words “Digital" and "dystopia" to describe the hole I've found myself in.

    main goal is to compose negativity-afflicted content pieces which, by purely looking
    at data produce the highest amount of clicks and change the vision of the world
    in your head.

    which goes deep into conveying that the world is improving day-by-day, rather
    than moving closer to an apocalypse.

    natural to Google (or search on Reddit) for explanations. And really, when you
    describe that state of mind, all answers point in the same direction -- ADHD.

    meds to finally escape this mindset. Luckily, I didn't go for meds, but rather
    switching to a dumbphone for 2 weeks, and lo and behold, after just a week, the
    "ADHD-virus" suddenly started disappearing.

    one is a bit difficult to write about as it encompasses many things but I'll try
    to entangle it as good as I can.

- en: There are multiple factors that drive depression such as isolation; which often
    stems from being constantly alone, indoors and/or having a fake sense of "being
    social" by socializing with strangers on the internet, lack of confidence; stemming
    from comparing ourselves to others, letting go of ourselves and avoiding basic
    hygiene, grasping for quick dopamine hits or actions that yield in sweeping the
    "depressive" thoughts under a rug, and so on, and so forth.

- en: Re-reading the paragraph above, I don't think I've done a good job of entangling
    it but I'll make a note to write a whole article on it. The consensus is, all
    of the bad habits, such as doomscrolling, isolation and gaming, keep feeding the
    depressed state of the mind by temporarily applying bandaids on where it hurts.
    The problem is, those bandaids need to be ripped off constantly, and every time
    they do get ripped off, it hurts. It hurts even more. And it creates new wounds.

    require discipline. A lot of discipline. And that's the hardest part. I'll write
    them down but keep in mind that, written like this, you'll have to constantly
    think about them and force yourselves to do them, which is not ideal, so please
    stay tuned on future articles where I'll do a detailed breakdown and follow-along
    that everyone can follow and (hopefully) succeed.
