- en: The NFL is infamous for coming down like a ton of bricks on anyone who dares
    use the actual name for the game in public. And it's also famous for trying to
    grab control of the names people started using when the NFL’s tactics worked and
    scared everyone away from saying “Super Bowl.” No matter how hard [the NFL tries](https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20160205/13584533536/nfl-edging-towards-claiming-trademark-big-game-again.shtml),
    it doesn’t own the phrase “The Big Game,” which has been used for longer than
    there’s been a Super Bowl. But anything that looks like someone making money off
    of the name will attract the NFL’s attention. In 2007, the NFL put a stop to an
    Indiana church’s party for a number of reasons, [including](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/nfl-to-churches-not-in-thy-fathers-house/)
    that the church promoted it as a “Super Bowl bash.”

    doesn’t mean it actually controls all rights to the phrase. Instinctually, we
    all know [that can’t be how the law works](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2013/11/trademark-law-does-not-require-companies-tirelessly-censor-internet).
    We see and use trademarked names for things all the time. Grocery stores advertise
    special deals on Coca-Cola and we put “Windex” on our grocery lists. Commercials
    [namecheck](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_WK1WhZbI0) competitors by name all
    the time.

    can have something that everyone instantly recognizes, not so that they suddenly
    become Voldemort and can’t be named out of fear.

    your product onto theirs and confuse buyers into thinking they’re getting the
    real thing. It also means stopping an instance where using the name might make
    someone think it’s an endorsement or sponsorship. If neither of those things happens,
    you can call the Super Bowl the Super Bowl. The ability to use something’s trademarked
    name to identify it—even in a commercial—is called “nominative fair use.” Because
    the trademark is its *name*.

    has paid astronomical amounts to get the NFL’s endorsement. Ads end with things
    like “official [vehicle sponsor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kb_tGiMcZBg)
    of the NFL” and there’s a whole page of sponsor names on the [Super Bowl’s website](https://www.mnsuperbowl.com/official-partners).
    There are so many instantly recognizable ways to know who has partnered with the
    NFL and who hasn’t that no one can think your party is an official, NFL-sponsored
    get together. No one thought that about the one at the church in 2007.

- en: The reason no one says “Super Bowl” has nothing to do with the law and everything
    to do with the massive amount of resources the NFL has brought to bear on the
    issue. Its pockets are very deep, its will is strong, and its desire for control
    ravenous. But its scare tactics don’t change the fact that you can totally say
    “Super Bowl.”
