- en: The NFL is infamous for coming down like a ton of bricks on anyone who dares
    use the actual name for the game in public. And it's also famous for trying to
    grab control of the names people started using when the NFL’s tactics worked and
    scared everyone away from saying “Super Bowl.” No matter how hard [the NFL tries](https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20160205/13584533536/nfl-edging-towards-claiming-trademark-big-game-again.shtml),
    it doesn’t own the phrase “The Big Game,” which has been used for longer than
    there’s been a Super Bowl. But anything that looks like someone making money off
    of the name will attract the NFL’s attention. In 2007, the NFL put a stop to an
    Indiana church’s party for a number of reasons, [including](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/nfl-to-churches-not-in-thy-fathers-house/)
    that the church promoted it as a “Super Bowl bash.”

  zh: 国家橄榄球联盟因为曾经成功地吓唬了所有人而著名，因此对于任何敢在公共场合使用游戏实际名称的人都会严厉打击。它也以试图控制人们开始使用的名称而闻名，当时国家橄榄球联盟的策略起作用并吓跑了所有人不再说“超级碗”。无论国家橄榄球联盟多么努力[尝试](https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20160205/13584533536/nfl-edging-towards-claiming-trademark-big-game-again.shtml)，它并不拥有“大游戏”这个短语，这个名称比超级碗还要早使用很多年。但是任何看起来像有人在名字上赚钱的事情都会吸引国家橄榄球联盟的注意。2007年，国家橄榄球联盟因为多种原因，包括[教堂将其宣传为“超级碗派对”](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/nfl-to-churches-not-in-thy-fathers-house/)，而停止了印第安纳州的一家教堂的派对。

    doesn’t mean it actually controls all rights to the phrase. Instinctually, we
    all know [that can’t be how the law works](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2013/11/trademark-law-does-not-require-companies-tirelessly-censor-internet).
    We see and use trademarked names for things all the time. Grocery stores advertise

- en: Having a trademark means being able to make sure no one can slap the name of
    your product onto theirs and confuse buyers into thinking they’re getting the
    real thing. It also means stopping an instance where using the name might make
    someone think it’s an endorsement or sponsorship. If neither of those things happens,
    you can call the Super Bowl the Super Bowl. The ability to use something’s trademarked
    name to identify it—even in a commercial—is called “nominative fair use.” Because
    the trademark is its *name*.

- en: Thankfully, the NFL and the Super Bowl are really good at letting us know who
    has paid astronomical amounts to get the NFL’s endorsement. Ads end with things
    like “official [vehicle sponsor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kb_tGiMcZBg)
    of the NFL” and there’s a whole page of sponsor names on the [Super Bowl’s website](https://www.mnsuperbowl.com/official-partners).
    There are so many instantly recognizable ways to know who has partnered with the
    NFL and who hasn’t that no one can think your party is an official, NFL-sponsored
    get together. No one thought that about the one at the church in 2007.

  zh: 感谢地，NFL 和超级碗真的非常擅长让我们知道，有哪些公司为了获取NFL的认可支付了天文数字的金额。广告以“官方[车辆赞助商](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kb_tGiMcZBg)”之类的方式结束，并且在[超级碗的网站](https://www.mnsuperbowl.com/official-partners)上列出了一整页的赞助商名字。有很多一眼就能认出的方式告诉我们，是谁与NFL合作了，是谁没有，以至于没有人会认为你的聚会是官方的、由NFL赞助的聚会。2007年的那场在教堂举行的聚会就没有人会这么认为。
- en: The reason no one says “Super Bowl” has nothing to do with the law and everything
    to do with the massive amount of resources the NFL has brought to bear on the
    issue. Its pockets are very deep, its will is strong, and its desire for control
    ravenous. But its scare tactics don’t change the fact that you can totally say
    “Super Bowl.”
