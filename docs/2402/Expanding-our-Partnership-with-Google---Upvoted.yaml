- en: Over the last 18 years, Reddit has become one of the internet’s largest open
    archives of authentic and constantly-updated human-generated conversations and
    experiences. Aligned with our belief that everyone should be able to find the
    information they need and the experiences they want online, we’ve expanded our
    partnership with Google to make it easier to discover and access the communities
    and conversations people are looking for on Reddit.

    Reddit content to be displayed across Google products by providing programmatic
    access to new, constantly evolving, and dynamic public posts, comments, etc.,
    on Reddit. This enhanced collaboration provides Google with an efficient and structured
    way to access the vast corpus of existing content on Reddit and enables Google
    to use the Reddit Data API to improve its products and services – including supporting
    new ways to display Reddit content and providing more efficient ways to train
    models.
