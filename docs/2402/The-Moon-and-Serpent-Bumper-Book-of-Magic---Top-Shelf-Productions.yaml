    history of magic from the last ice age to the present day, told in a series of
    easy-to-absorb pictorial biographies of fifty great enchanters and complemented
    by a variety of picture stories depicting events ranging from the Palaeolithic
    origins of art, magic, language and consciousness to the rib-tickling comedy exploits
    of Moon & Serpent founder Alexander the False Prophet (“He’s fun, he’s fake, he’s
    got a talking snake!”).

    a series of helpful travel guides to mind-wrenching alien dimensions that are
    within comfortable walking distance, as well as profiles of the many quaint local
    inhabitants that one might bump into at these exotic resorts. A full range of
    entertainments will be provided, encompassing such diverse novelties and pursuits
    as a lavishly decorated decadent pulp tale of occult adventure recounted in the
    serial form. Completing this almost-unimaginable treasure trove is a lengthy thesis
    revealing the ultimate meaning of both the Moon and the Serpent in a manner that
    makes transparent the much-obscured secret of magic, happiness, sex, creativity
    and the known Universe, while at the same time explaining why these lunar and
    ophidian symbols feature so prominently in the order’s peculiar name. (Manufacturer’s
    disclaimer: this edition does not, however, reveal why the titular cabal of magicians
    consider themselves to be either grand or Egyptian. Let the buyer beware.)'
