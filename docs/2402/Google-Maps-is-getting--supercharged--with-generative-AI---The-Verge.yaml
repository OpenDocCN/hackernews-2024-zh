- en: Google is bringing generative AI to — [where else?](/2023/10/26/23932315/google-maps-ai-immersive-view-ev-charging-search)
    — Google Maps, promising to help users find cool places through the use of large
    language models (LLM).

- en: The feature will answer queries for restaurant or shopping recommendations,
    for example, using its LLM to “analyze Maps’ detailed information about more than
    250 million places and trusted insights from our community of over 300 million
    contributors to quickly make suggestions for where to go.”

    word yet on when other countries will also get it.

- en: It’s a natural place for Google to flex its AI muscles, as the company has been
    laboring for years to turn its flagship navigation product into something that
    [more closely resembles a search tool](/2023/10/26/23932315/google-maps-ai-immersive-view-ev-charging-search)
    for discovering new places — rather than just a place to get directions. Using
    its expertise generative AI to accelerate that transition seems like a logical
    next step.

- en: Let’s say you’re visiting San Francisco and want to plan a few hours of thrifting
    for unique vintage finds. Just ask Maps what you’re looking for, like “places
    with a vintage vibe in SF.” Our AI models will analyze Maps’ rich information
    about nearby businesses and places along with photos, ratings and reviews from
    the Maps community to give you trustworthy suggestions.

    with the company’s [Local Guides community of contributors](/2019/11/18/20970880/google-maps-local-guide-social)
    to ensure that generative AI is employed thoughtfully. That means only these contributors
    will initially have access to the generative AI feature in Google Maps. The company
    will then open it up to other users at a later date.

    global community of explorers who write reviews, share photos, answer questions,
    add or edit places, and check facts on Google Maps.”

- en: It’s unclear how much different this will be than, say, just searching “vintage
    store SF” in the regular Google Maps search bar. My guess is the response will
    be more conversational in that chatbot style with which we’re slowly becoming
    familiar, rather than just providing a list of vintage shops in order of proximity.
