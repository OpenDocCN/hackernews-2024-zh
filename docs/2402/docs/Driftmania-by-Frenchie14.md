# Tiny Tracks. Fast Laps

Driftmania is an arcade time trial racing game. Your goal is to get the fastest possible time on each of the 15 challenging tracks

**Controls (Racing)**

**Controls (Menu)**

*   **Arrow keys**: navigate selection

**Tips**

*   You turn faster when holding the D-Brake
*   Take a good look at the minimap before starting a track. You need to anticipate the turns to get the best times
*   Grass does not slow you down. It reduces traction, which you can use to your advantage for drifting!

*   Driving over yellow tiles will activate boost. Boost works with whatever direction you're facing - it doesn't matter where the arrow on the ground is pointing
*   Garage customizations do not change car handling. Make your car look however you want it to!
*   An optional ghost can be enabled in the pause menu. **Replays are lost when exiting a track**
