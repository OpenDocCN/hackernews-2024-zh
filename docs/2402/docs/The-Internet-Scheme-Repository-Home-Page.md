# The Internet Scheme Repository

* * *

*The Scheme repository is not presently being maintained. Please visit [schemers.org](http://www.schemers.org) for a more up-to-date Scheme site!*

* * *

The repository currently consists of the following areas:

<menu>*   [Latest](LATEST.html) contributions, noteworthy items.*   Lots of [scheme code](code.html) meant for benchmarking, library/support, research, education, and fun.*   [On-line documents](doc.html): Machine readable standards documents, standards proposals, various Scheme-related tech reports, conference papers, mail archives, FAQs, etc.*   Most of the publicly distributable Scheme [Implementations](imp.html).*   Material designed primarily for [instruction](ftp://ftp.cs.indiana.edu/pub/scheme-repository/instruct).*   Freely-distributable [promotional](promo.html) or demonstration material for Scheme-related products, including the READMEs from Scheme implementations in the Repository.*   [Utilities](utl.html) (e.g., Schemeweb, SLaTeX).*   [Links](links.html) to other Web sites.*   [Extraneous stuff](ext.html), extensions, etc.</menu>

* * *

An excellent list of [Scheme implementations](ftp://ftp.cs.indiana.edu/pub/scheme-repository/doc/misc/scheme_2.faq) (part 2 of Mark Kantrowitz's Scheme FAQ) is available.

A list of most [file formats](file_formats.html) of items stored in the repository is available, if you have any problems.

The Scheme Repository is mirrored in Europe:
