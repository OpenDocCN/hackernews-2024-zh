# The Mission Pinball Framework (MPF)

*Open source software for powering real pinball machines!*

The **Mission Pinball Framework** (MPF) is a free Python-based pinball software framework that's used to run real pinball machines. It's compatible with virtually all modern pinball controllers and machines, and it's the most feature complete pinball software environment you'll find.

MPF is a complete pinball software package which runs on a computer inside your pinball machine. (It can run on Windows, Mac, Linux, or Raspberry Pi.) MPF controls all the electronics in the machine, including the lights, the solenoids (the things that make the balls move), the DMD if your machine has one, the LCD if your machine has one, the switches, and the motors. MPF uses simple configuration files to control the game logic, sounds, videos, effects, and everything else you need to create the rules for your game, including modes, multiballs, ball saves, scoring, and more.

MPF has been around since 2014, and it's been used to power hundreds of homebrew pinball machines and a few commercially-released ones. It's created by volunteers in their spare time.

## Getting Started

What MPF is, how it works, how to install it, how to use it.

## Hardware

Pinball machines, control systems, and pinball mechs.

## Game Programming

See the [Tools page](tools/) for links to several tools that help you work with MPF, including the [MPF Monitor](tools/monitor/), a visual utility that connects to a live running instance of MPF and shows you the stream of events, device state, player variables, etc.
