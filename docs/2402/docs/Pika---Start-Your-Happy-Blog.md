# Pika - Start Your Happy Blog

A few words about pricing…

We believe that software shouldn’t make money from ads nor tracking its customers. As they say, *if you’re not paying, you’re the product.* To that end, you can start blogging on Pika right away for free for up to 50 full blog posts, but unlimited blogging will eventually need a paid subscription.

Using Pika means you’ll be in control of your writing and data, and supporting indie software made with expertise and care. In return, we’ll never sell your data or slap an obnoxious ad on your blog.
