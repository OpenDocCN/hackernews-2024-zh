# Expanding our Partnership with Google - Upvoted

Over the last 18 years, Reddit has become one of the internet’s largest open archives of authentic and constantly-updated human-generated conversations and experiences. Aligned with our belief that everyone should be able to find the information they need and the experiences they want online, we’ve expanded our partnership with Google to make it easier to discover and access the communities and conversations people are looking for on Reddit.

With this partnership, and via our Data API, we’re ushering in new ways for Reddit content to be displayed across Google products by providing programmatic access to new, constantly evolving, and dynamic public posts, comments, etc., on Reddit. This enhanced collaboration provides Google with an efficient and structured way to access the vast corpus of existing content on Reddit and enables Google to use the Reddit Data API to improve its products and services – including supporting new ways to display Reddit content and providing more efficient ways to train models.

Our work with Google will make it easier for people to find, discover, and engage in content and communities on Reddit that are most relevant to them.

By making Reddit content and communities easier to find, we’re able to uphold our belief in the open internet while better serving current users and reaching new audiences. All of this builds on our existing partnership with Google Cloud to integrate new AI-powered capabilities to improve Reddit and help achieve our mission of bringing community, belonging, and empowerment to everyone in the world.

This expanded partnership does not change Reddit's Data API Terms or Developer Terms, which state content accessed through Reddit’s Data API cannot be used for commercial purposes without Reddit’s approval. API access remains free for non-commercial usage under our published threshold.
