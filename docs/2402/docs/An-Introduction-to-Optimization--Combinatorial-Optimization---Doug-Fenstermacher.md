 *## Overview[🔗](#overview)

During my time working in fundraising, I worked on the web development side, building and maintaining websites and tools for public and internal use. Many of the problems that kept coming up in my department were optimization problems, many of which were directly related to business operations. Producing print collateral at optimal pricing, optimizing table layouts for events, scheduling/assigning work, minimizing travel costs, etc. Here I learned that while rule-based programming was useful automating known processes, optimization problems tend to make the biggest difference and time commitment for the majority of business decisions. These decisions ranged from simple (minimizing paper costs for print invitations), to complex (prioritizing content based on audience demographics/giving potential). Since moving on to other opportunities, I still dwell on the value of solving optimization problems in business scenarios.

Machine learning is a very prominent field right now. It is enabling companies to use data to resolve issues and gains insights that were unfeasible to find or even tackle using other methods. But not all problems can be resolved using machine learning, and historical data does not provide insights for all problems. For example, there is no amount of seating data for past weddings that will enable a machine learning model to learn to create a wedding seating chart for minimizing conflicts (that is, unless there are previous weddings where the exact same group attends, which would unusual). Or for finding the optimal travel route s for FedEx delivery trucks. These are the problems that are slower to find answers to, but crucial for business (or wedding) operations.

Solving optimization problems efficiently in a computer program is ultimately using mathematical optimization techniques to solve a given problem. Wikipedia defines **Mathematical Optimization** as:

> the selection of a best element (with regard to some criterion) from some set of available alternatives.

which is a good simple explanation of optimization. There is no correct solution, only varying degrees of better and worse solutions. For example if a store wants to set the price for a product to maximize theirs profits, they should not sell a product for less than they purchased it for, and should not sell the product for more than customers will buy it for. If the store sells the product at a minimal value, their profit will be lower, but if they sell it at a price greater than what customers will pay, then they will get fewer sales. There is no right or wrong answer, just answers that lead to more/less profit. Those prices that lead to less profit can be considered sub-optimal solutions to the profit maximization problem. There are many possible prices that can be set for a given problem, optimization algorithms are used to reduce the computations needed to arrive at an optimal solution.

Combinatorial optimization is a subset of mathematical optimization for identifying how to optimize their finite set of resources to optimize production or profits. While less commonly used than linear programming, combinatorial optimization is an essential skill for finding optimal solutions for business problems.

## Subset Sums[🔗](#subset-sums)

Combinatorial optimization problems are a very common type of problem, writing programs that determine a solution quickly can be difficult, and in some cases, impossible. For many combinatorial optimization problems, there are currently no efficient methods to solve them at scale. But, there are many optimization problems that do have efficient solutions, which we will cover. To start off, we will go through the most common situations for optimizations. To get started, we will work through the [subset-sum problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subset_sum_problem):

> given a set (or multiset) of integers, is there a non-empty subset whose sum is zero?

In this problem, we are attempting to efficiently determine the set of items with the largest sum without exceeding a given number. This is useful for determining how to efficiently load a shipping truck, without exceeding its maximum weight:

def subset_sum(input_data, limit, labels=None):
    if not labels:
        labels = input_data
    elif labels and len(input_data) != len(labels):
        raise ValueError('input_data(%r) and labels(%r) must be of equal length' % (input_data,  labels))

    if not limit or limit < 0:
        raise ValueError('limit(%s) must be a positive number' % limit)

    cache = [None for _ in range(limit+1)]
    cache[0] = []

    cache_labels = [None for _ in range(limit+1)]
    cache_labels[0] = []
    for label, new_value in zip(labels, input_data):
        for i in range(limit - new_value, -1, -1):
            if cache[i] is not None:
                cache[i + new_value] = cache[i] + [new_value]
                cache_labels[i + new_value] = cache_labels[i] + [label]
    return max(zip(cache_labels, cache), key=lambda v: sum(v[1]))

data = [13, -3, -25, 20, -3, -16, 0, 18, 20, -7, 12, -5, 12, -5, -22, 15, -4, 7]
# correct answer: max subset: [20, -3, -16, 0, 18, 20, -7, 12, -5, 12], sum: 51 print 'Maximum Subarray: %r, Max: %r' % max_subarray(data)

```

 | 
```

The subset-sum problem can be used to identify how to fill a container with the most items without exceeding a given capacity. This could be how to effectively fill a filing cabinet, how to fill a shipping container with the most weight, or how to fill a hard drive with the most files, while leaving minimal unused space

## Knapsacks[🔗](#knapsacks)

The subset-sum problem, is actually a special case of the [knapsack problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knapsack_problem),:

> Given a set of items, each with a weight and a value, determine the number of each item to include in a collection so that the total weight is less than or equal to a given limit and the total value is as large as possible.

So this is similar to the subset-sum problem, except we are trying to maximize our `value` as well. This problem involves maximizing the value of the chosen items, while not exceeding the value of our “knapsack”.

def knapsack(weights, values, capacity):
    item_count = len(weights)
    cache = [[0 for _ in range(capacity + 1)] for _ in range(item_count + 1)]

    for i in range(item_count + 1):
        for j in range(capacity + 1):
            old_value = cache[i-1][j]
            if i == 0 or j == 0:
                cache[i][j] = 0
            elif weights[i-1] <= j:
                new_value = values[i-1] + cache[i-1][j-weights[i-1]]
                cache[i][j] = max(old_value, new_value)
            else:
                cache[i][j] = old_value
    return cache[-1][-1]

values = [60, 100, 120]
weights = [10, 20, 30]
capacity = 50
max_value = knapsack(weights, values, capacity)  # 220

```

 | 
```

To get the index of items that were included in the knapsack, we can update the knapsack function to use the following code:

def knapsack_items(weights, values, capacity):
    item_count = len(weights)
    cache = [[0 for _ in range(capacity + 1)] for _ in range(item_count + 1)]

    # find max value
    for i in range(item_count + 1):
        for j in range(capacity + 1):
            old_value = cache[i-1][j]
            if i == 0 or j == 0:
                cache[i][j] = 0
            elif weights[i-1] <= j:
                new_value = values[i-1] + cache[i-1][j-weights[i-1]]
                cache[i][j] = max(old_value, new_value)
            else:
                cache[i][j] = old_value

    # fetch list of items in knapsack
    max_value = cache[item_count][capacity]
    indices = set()
    for i in range(item_count, 0, -1):
        if max_value <= 0:
            break
        if max_value == cache[i - 1][j]:
            continue
        else:
            indices.add(i - 1)
            max_value = max_value - values[i - 1]
            j = j - weights[i - 1]
    return cache[item_count][capacity], indices

values = [60, 100, 120]
weights = [10, 20, 30]
capacity = 50
max_value, item_indices = knapsack(weights, values, capacity)
print(max_value, item_indices) # 220, {1, 2}

```

 | 
```

**NOTE**: in cases where an two items have the same weight and value, they can be considered as iterchangeable items, as doing so would not affect the weight or value of the optimal knapsack.

If you examine this code closely, you may notice that the code is very inefficient, by checking every capacity between 0 and the specified `capacity`. In cases like above, where the weights are all multiples of 10, we can know that most capacities will not require changes. We can transform our `weights` and `capacity` values to minimize the number of iterations over the capacity by calculating the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the `weights` and `capacity` values and dividing the values by the GCD. Here is an example below, which results in the same solution as the original problem as above

```
 |  
```
1
2
3
4
5

```

 |  
```
knapsack_gcd = gcd(capacity, *weights)
minified_weights = [int(value / knapsack_gcd) for value in weights]
minified_capacity = int(capacity / knapsack_gcd)
max_value, item_indices = knapsack_items(minified_weights, values, minified_capacity)
print(max_value, item_indices)

```

 | 
```

Another variation of the knapsack problem is the [Continuous knapsack problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_knapsack_problem), which allows fractions of items to be put in the knapsack.

## Activity Selection[🔗](#activity-selection)

Our next problem we will tackle is the [activity selection problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activity_selection_problem):

> The problem is to select the maximum number of activities that can be performed by a single person or machine, assuming that a person can only work on a single activity at a time.

This problem can be generalized to this: maximize the number of intervals that can be sequenced without overlapping.

def activity_selection(names, start_times, finish_times):
    assert len(names) == len(start_times) == len(finish_times)

    heap = zip(finish_times, start_times, names)
    heapq.heapify(heap)
    previous_selection = heapq.heappop(heap)
    selections = [previous_selection]

    while heap:
        selection = heapq.heappop(heap)
        if selection[1] >= previous_selection[0]:
            selections.append(selection)
            previous_selection = selection
    return selections

```

 | 
```

But what about the case where we some intervals are more important than others? We want to make sure that we maximize the weights of our set of chosen events.

    item_count = len(heap)

    for i, item in enumerate(heapq.nsmallest(item_count, heap)):
        for j, other_item in enumerate(heapq.nsmallest(i, heap)):
            if other_item[0] <= item[1]:
                weight_cache[i] = max(weight_cache[i], weight_cache[j] + item[3])
            maxi = max(weight_cache[i], maxi)

    for i, item in reversed(list(enumerate(heapq.nsmallest(item_count, heap)))):
        if weight_cache[i] == maxi:
            maxi -= item[3]
            selections.append(item)

    return list(reversed(selections))

activities = 'abcde'
start_times = [10, 12, 12, 13, 15]
finish_times = [11, 13, 12.5, 15, 17]
weights = [1, 3, 2, 5, 1]
print 'Selected Activities (unweighted): %r' % activity_selection(activities, start_times, finish_times)
print 'Selected Activities (weighted): %r' % activity_selection_weighted(activities, start_times, finish_times, weights)

```

 | 
```

Activity selection has applications for scheduling events. The activity selection problem has applications in scheduling meets, conference scheduling, and in recommending schedules to attendees of events. This solution to the problem would have been particularly useful for providing a recommended attendance scheduling for alumni.

## Task Assignment[🔗](#task-assignment)

The last combinatorial problem we will cover is the [assignment problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assignment_problem):

> The problem instance has a number of agents and a number of tasks. Any agent can be assigned to perform any task, incurring some cost that may vary depending on the agent-task assignment. It is required to perform all tasks by assigning exactly one agent to each task and exactly one task to each agent in such a way that the total cost of the assignment is minimized.

This problem requires us to calculate a cost matrix, made of m rows of workers, and n columns of tasks to be completed. My example is for tasking workers on a flower farm to maximize profit for the farm, based on their wages and rate at which they pick flowers.

```

```

 |  
```
def build_cost_matrix(workers, tasks, cost_func):
    return [[cost_func(worker, task) for task in tasks] for worker in workers]

def profit(worker, task):
    return (worker['rate'] * task) - worker['pay']

workers = [{'pay': 20, 'rate': 300}, {'pay': 10.5, 'rate': 200}, {'pay': 15, 'rate': 150}, {'pay': 6.5, 'rate': 100}, {'pay': 17.5, 'rate': 200}]
flowers =dict(orchid=10, daisy=2.25, daffodil=1.70, dandelion=0.001, grass=0.0001)
flower_labels = flowers.keys()
flower_assignments = flowers.values()

```

 | 
```

We could normally could iterate through every possible combination of workers and flowers and find the maximum profit, especially since we only have 5 workers and 5 assignments, but that would not scale well if we had a large flower-growing business with hundred of workers and hundreds of types of flowers. We will need to use a more scaleable method. If we did not have a library, we would implement a [Hungarian algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarian_algorithm), however it is a rather complicated algorithm which is a topic for another day. Fortunately, scipy has an [implementation](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy-0.18.1/reference/generated/scipy.optimize.linear_sum_assignment.html) that we can use:

from scipy.optimize import linear_sum_assignment

def flower_picker_cost(worker, task):
    return 0 - abs(profit(worker, task))

cost_matrix = build_cost_matrix(workers, flower_assignments, flower_picker_cost)

worker_indexes, assignment_indexes = linear_sum_assignment(cost_matrix)

for worker_index, assignment_index in zip(worker_indexes, assignment_indexes):
    worker = workers[worker_index]
    flower = flower_labels[assignment_index]
    print 'Worker=%r, flower=%s, profitability=$%s' %  (worker, flower, profit(worker, flowers[flower]))

import numpy as np
minimum_cost =  np.array(cost_matrix)[worker_indexes, assignment_indexes].sum()
print 'Maximum profit: $%s' % abs(minimum_cost)

"""
Worker={'pay': 20, 'rate': 300}, flower=orchid, profitability=$2980/hour
Worker={'pay': 10.5, 'rate': 200}, flower=daisy, profitability=$439.5/hour
Worker={'pay': 15, 'rate': 150}, flower=dandelion, profitability=$-14.85/hour
Worker={'pay': 6.5, 'rate': 100}, flower=grass, profitability=$-6.49/hour
Worker={'pay': 17.5, 'rate': 200}, flower=daffodil, profitability=$322.5/hour
Maximum Profit: $3720.6600000000003/hour
"""

```

 | 
```

Notice that we made our `flower_picker_cost` function return `0 - profit(worker, task)`. `scipy.optimize.linear_sum_assignment` implementation is used to minimize a cost function. Since our measure of success is profitability, we ensure that the cost our most profitable worker-flower assignments return the lowest cost. We could have used the formula `1 / - profit(worker, task)`, but I wanted to make the cost function simple and easy to interpret for users. Let’s try the same code on a large number of tasks and workers

The assignment problem comes up often in everyday life, such as optimally determining which athletic trainer to assign to each athlete in a queue, determining how to assign technicians to support tickets based on their skillset and location, or determining the optimal way to assign salesperson to potential companies.

## Minimum Set Cover[🔗](#minimum-set-cover)

One such approximation algorithm is that of the [Minimum Set Cover problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_cover_problem):

> Given a set of elements {1,2,...,n} (called the universe) and a collection S of m sets whose union equals the universe, the set cover problem is to identify the smallest sub-collection of S whose union equals the universe

Set coverings can be used to create solutions for purchasing inventory, creating work schedules for shift hours a training room, creating the minimal team that has the required skillset for a project, or finding the minimal number of officials required to host a meet based on the division requirements.

In our examples, the algorithms solved our problems almost instantaneously. In a production setting with larger datasets, we would likely rewrite these algorithms as a separate library in Cython to solv larger instances of the problems without performance issues.

## Larger problems[🔗](#larger-problems)

The problems we have examined so far are fairly simple problems. In a business settings, many problems that need to be resolved have more potential solutions, more constraints, and more dimensions. Computer scientists and operations research specialists have spent decades building and optimizing specialized libraries for solving these types of problems. The most time-efficient way for us to use would be to use their optimized libraries to solve our optimization problems. Their libraries will allow us to focus on solving our business-related issues using the best methods available.

The above all are very reputable and optimized libraries for solving optimization problems. For Python, I would recommend using Google’s [ORTools](https://developers.google.com/optimization/). Google ORTools provides a Python interface to many of the above tools, allowing Python developers to leverage the above libraries without needing to know how each of them work.

Here is a real-life scenario: Let’s say we want to invest in our online advertising and we want to get the most conversions we can using our limited budget, but we have a set of business constraints that we have to meet. Using only conversion rates across mediums, and our customer reach/dollar, we can find the optimal allocation of funds in less than a quarter of a second.

A significant benefit of ORTools is its ability to solve linear, integer and mixed-integer problems and to define the problem at runtime. Many specialized optimization tools have their own language syntax for creating optimization programs, which makes building the problem at runtime more painful for developers.

## Seating Assignment[🔗](#seating-assignment)

One of the biggest pains of brides (so I hear), is to organize the seating charts for wedding receptions. In a perfect world this wouldn’t be a problem because all relatives/friends would love each other’s company. But that’s not going to happen. So brides have to find a way to group the guests so that everyone can enjoy the company of fellow guests, and not be seated with company they don’t enjoy (and potentially cause wedding drama). Fortunately, operations researchers identified this type of issue as one worth solving. In our seating assignment problem, our objective is simple: maximize the number of people sitting together who like each other. We can create a data representation to use to maximize our objective by creating a matrix representation of all sentiments/relationships between all attendees of the wedding. an edge’s weight reflects the sentiment/relationship that one guest has for another. If the relationship is non-existent or a person feels ambivalent towards the other, the weight should be ~0. We will have a number of constraints that we will need to account for:

*   A table cannot be assigned more guests than it has seats for
*   A guest cannot have more than 1 assigned seat
*   A guests must have know more at least a given number of guests at their table. some guests may require more/less known guests than others
*   Tables may have varying capacities due to different types of tables, or different numbers of available chairs

Now that we have our objectives and constraints we can write our actual model:

Using ortools, we were able to create a flexible model that meets all our constraints. We even allow developers to specify table_capacity and min_known_neighbor constraints as an integer or as a list. Let’s check our output:

```
total guests: 17
total seats: 19
conflicts    : 4253
 branches     : 6426
wall time    : 0.678285 ms
Seating assignments:
Guest: 'Brad (B)', Table: 0
Guest: 'Diane (G)', Table: 2
Guest: 'Bob (G)', Table: 3
Guest: 'Kathy (B)', Table: 1
Guest: 'Laura (G)', Table: 2
Guest: 'John (B)', Table: 0
Guest: 'Cory (B)', Table: 1
Guest: 'Abby (B)', Table: 1
Guest: 'Jeff (B)', Table: 1
Guest: 'Matt (B)', Table: 0
Guest: 'Mary (G)', Table: 3
Guest: 'Carmela (B)', Table: 1
Guest: 'Will (G)', Table: 2
Guest: 'Lee (G)', Table: 3
Guest: 'Mike (B)', Table: 0
Guest: 'Scott (G)', Table: 3
Guest: 'Ann (G)', Table: 3
Optimal Score: 283 
```

This model can be expanded to include even more constraints, so our model still has room to grow as more more constraints arise. This same model can also be applied to other scenarios such as conference seating charts, assigning project teams, etc.
