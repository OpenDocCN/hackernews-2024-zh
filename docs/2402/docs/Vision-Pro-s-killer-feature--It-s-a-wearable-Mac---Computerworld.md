“With tools like OmniPlan, you can plan out scenarios and see how your changes ripple through the rest of the project in real time,” Omni Group CEO Ken Case said in a statement. “Large Gantt charts have been in my life for as long as I can remember. It is no exaggeration that modern tools have revolutionized the process of planning huge projects. Until now, those tools have been constrained by your screen. The infinite canvas provided by Apple Vision Pro is a dream come true for project planners, project managers, and industrial engineers.”

This should have implications in any operational environment; it’s easy to imagine day traders using Vision Pro devices to replace or supplement the triple-display setups so many use to monitor all the data their investment decisions rely on.

## **Apps without frontiers**

Apple today noted numerous other productive apps, including enterprise-grade cloud storage stalwart Box and brainstorming application MindNode. Apple also cited Webex, Zoom, Fantastical, Numerics, JigSpace, Navi, Slack, Todoist, and Notion as apps that are, at the very least, compatible with its new platform.
