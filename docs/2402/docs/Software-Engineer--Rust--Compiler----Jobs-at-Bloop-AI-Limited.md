# Software Engineer (Rust, Compiler) | Jobs at Bloop AI Limited

> 来源：[https://bloop.jobs.personio.com/job/1410410](https://bloop.jobs.personio.com/job/1410410)

##### Background

bloop's automatic code translation solution automates the menial task of moving code between a source and target language. Traditional approaches to this problem result in code that is unreadable, and the alternative of rewriting a system from scratch is unfeasibly expensive for many projects. We're pioneering a novel approach to this age-old problem, building on our expertise in solving coding problems with LLMs.

Since launching bloop we’ve introduced thousands of engineers to AI assisted software development, won Product Hunt’s Product of the Day, and raised our seed funding round from leading investors including Y Combinator (S21), Khosla Ventures, Sands Capital and LocalGlobe.

As we head into our next period of growth, we’re looking to partner with people that are hungry to work at the cutting edge of innovation and research, and directly impact the way tomorrow’s software engineers work.

##### The Role

We're automating code translation between two programming languages. To do this we're developing pipelines that utilise source to source compilers and LLMs that can scale to support massive amounts of code. 

You'll work at the heart of this, collaborating with a small, talented team to design and implement the core engine that powers the pipeline. You'll work on the forefront of compilers, automated testing, LLMs (training and local inference) and static analysis.

You'll love what we're working on if you're interested in

You'll be joining a small group of engineers who are obsessed with the challenges posed by code translation, and who want to build tools to improve the process of writing and maintaining software.

**Key requirements**

*   Proficiency in Rust
*   Understanding compiler design
*   Understanding programming language design
*   (Bonus) Experience with static analysis

**The deal**

*   Competitive package
*   Work from our office in Farringdon, London, UK most of the time
*   Even if you only meet some of the requirements, it's worth applying as we're all from non-traditional backgrounds and are open minded

##### About us

bloop is a Y-Combinator backed startup building the next big developer tools company, like GitHub or StackOverflow. We use machine learning to automate menial tasks in the software development lifecycle, increasing the productivity of software ​developers.
