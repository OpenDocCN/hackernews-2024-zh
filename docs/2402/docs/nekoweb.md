Nekoweb is a free static website hosting service, created in ~~2022~~ ~~2023~~ 2024 by a group of coders, programmers and artists, passionate for the old web and personal websites.
Social media is too limiting. We believe that everyone should be able to freely express themselves in their own little corner of the web, without having to worry about things like algorithms, tracking, or advertisements.
Nekoweb is free of any advertisements, and is run completely by donations from its users.
