# NSA Hacker Chief Explains How to Keep Him Out of Your System | WIRED

In general, Joyce noted, spies have little trouble getting into your network because they know better than you what's on it.

"We put the time in ...to know [that network] better than the people who designed it and the people who are securing it," he said. "You know the technologies you intended to use in that network. We know the technologies that are actually in use in that network. Subtle difference. You'd be surprised about the things that are running on a network vs. the things that you think are supposed to be there."

How to Keep the NSA Out

If you really want to make the NSA's life hard, he ticked off a list of things to do: limit access privileges for important systems to those who really need them; segment networks and important data to make it harder for hackers to reach your jewels; patch systems and implement application whitelisting; remove hardcoded passwords and legacy protocols that transmit passwords in the clear.

Another nightmare for the NSA? An "out-of-band network tap"—a device that monitors network activity and produces logs that can record anomalous activity—plus a smart system administrator who actually reads the logs and pays attention to what they say.

Contrary to popular opinion, he says the NSA and other APT attackers don't rely on [zero-day exploits](https://www.wired.com/2014/11/what-is-a-zero-day/) extensively—unique attacks that take advantage of previously unknown software holes to get into systems. That's because they don't have to.

"[With] any large network, I will tell you that persistence and focus will get you in, will achieve that exploitation without the zero days," he says. "There's so many more vectors that are easier, less risky and quite often more productive than going down that route." This includes, of course, known vulnerabilities for which a patch is available but the owner hasn't installed it.

Trust the NSA

Following his talk, Juan Andrés Guerrero-Saade, senior security researcher with Kaspersky Lab's Global Research and Analysis Team, asked about the issue of attribution and efforts by some attack groups to manipulate and alter indicators of compromise to thwart attribution or point the finger at someone else.

"It's amazing the amount of lawyers that DHS, FBI and NSA have," Joyce said. "So if the government is saying that we have positive attribution too, you ought to book it. Attribution is really really hard, so when the government's saying it, we're using the totality of the sources and methods we have to help inform that. [But] because those advanced persistent threats aren't going away, ... we can't bring all that information to the fore and be fully transparent about everything we know and how we know it."
