That’s some hen-durance!

A dapper Florida man is celebrating his [26th consecutive day of eating raw chicken](https://www.instagram.com/p/C3TcKEfv9by/) — a quest he plans to continue until he “gets a tummy ache.”

“This company sent me some hot sauce, so we’ll give it a go,” he said Tuesday on Instagram as he doused a thick piece of raw chicken with [Weaksauce Philly’s Tangerine Nightmare](https://www.weaksaucephilly.com/shop/tangerinenightmare) before consuming it. “Sweet and spicy!”

John, who is not sharing his surname for privacy reasons, has been documenting his unusual journey on the Instagram page [Raw Chicken Experiment](https://www.instagram.com/rawchickenexperiment/) for his flock of 395,000 followers.

[Vice notes that](https://www.vice.com/en/article/pka8qz/guy-eats-raw-chicken-instagram) two years ago the peckish [John vlogged](https://www.youtube.com/@rawmeatexperiment/videos) about “eating raw meat at Whole Foods every day till I die from bacteria” — until he got bored after 200 days.

John insists that he does “not need to eat raw chicken for likes.”

“I’ve experimented with raw [vegan diets](https://nypost.com/2023/10/05/vegan-food-isnt-manly-enough-according-to-men-researchers-want-to-change-that/), plant based, [carnivore](https://nypost.com/2024/01/02/lifestyle/influencer-swears-by-carnivore-diet-but-experts-are-not-fans/), milk only, raw beef, raw seafood, raw pork, [keto](https://nypost.com/2023/03/06/keto-diets-linked-to-high-risk-of-heart-disease-new-study/), [eating a stick of butter daily](https://nypost.com/2024/02/12/lifestyle/bodybuilder-eats-block-of-butter-a-day-says-physique-is-leaner-now/) on video etc,” he wrote Tuesday on Instagram. “I find it fascinating to try different fuels for my meat suit and see how it affects the simulation.”

However, experts say that chicken should be cooked to an internal temperature of 165 degrees Fahrenheit.

Raw poultry meat can harbor several different types of bacteria, including [salmonella](https://nypost.com/2022/08/01/usda-proposes-new-regulations-to-get-rid-of-salmonella-in-chicken/).

Consuming raw or undercooked chicken can cause diarrhea and vomiting.

[The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates](https://www.cdc.gov/foodsafety/chicken.html#:~:text=When%20cooked%2C%20chicken%20can%20be,illness%2C%20also%20called%20food%20poisoning.) that about 1 million people get sick from eating contaminated poultry every year in the US.

“Why aren’t you dead?” Australian radio host Kyle Sandilands asked John when he appeared Monday on [“The Kyle and Jackie O Show.”](https://www.iheart.com/podcast/239-the-kyle-jackie-o-show-27242949/episode/i-eat-raw-chicken-149779793/)

John shared that he’s eating chickens from a Florida farm.

He reported that [raw poultry tastes like](https://www.instagram.com/p/C3OShNVvAhh/) scallops or shrimp, sort of like sashimi, which is a Japanese delicacy.

“In Japan, they’ll have raw chicken on menus. I don’t think it’s the raw chicken itself that will kill you, it’s more what they’re doing to the animals in the factory farms,” John reasoned to Vice. “I’m getting the chickens from a farm half an hour away; they don’t use antibiotics, chlorine or injections.”

He plans to keep up his eggs-traordinary pursuit for 100 days — or until he’s hospitalized.

“What’s the worst thing that’s gonna happen? I’ll s–t myself for a week or something, but I’ve probably done worse things than that before in my life,” John told Vice.

“I try to put disclaimers up all the time that I don’t think anyone else should do this,” he added. “Even in my nutritional research, there are better raw foods to be eating, like beef. This is just a personal experiment for me.”
