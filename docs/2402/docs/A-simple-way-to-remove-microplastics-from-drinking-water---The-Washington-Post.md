# A simple way to remove microplastics from drinking water - The Washington Post

Tiny plastic particles can seem alarmingly ubiquitous and nearly impossible to get rid of — they’ve been found in [food](https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-solutions/2024/01/12/microplastics-fish-chicken-tofu-protein/?itid=lk_inline_manual_2), [breast milk](https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2024/02/05/breastfeeding-microplastics-risks-baby-nursing/?itid=lk_inline_manual_2) and [even clouds](https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2023/11/02/microplastics-clouds-climate-pollution/?itid=lk_inline_manual_2). But new research suggests that a simple solution could reduce microplastics in drinking water: boiling it.

In a [new paper](http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.estlett.4c00081) published Wednesday in the journal Environmental Science & Technology Letters,Zhanjun Li and Eddy Y. Zeng report that boiling and filtering water helped remove up to nearly 90 percent of the tiny plastic particles, which they write can be found in 129 of 159 tap water samples from 14 countries worldwide.
