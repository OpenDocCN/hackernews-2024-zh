As the World Health Organization raised questions this summer about the risks of a popular artificial sweetener, a new hashtag began spreading on the social media accounts of health professionals: #safetyofaspartame.

Steph Grasso, a registered dietitian from Oakton, Va., used the hashtag and told her 2.2 million followers [on TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/@stephgrassodietitian/video/7254287578281594154) that the [WHO warnings](https://www.who.int/news/item/15-05-2023-who-advises-not-to-use-non-sugar-sweeteners-for-weight-control-in-newly-released-guideline) about artificial sweeteners were “clickbait” based on “low-quality science.”
