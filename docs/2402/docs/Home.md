Project Oberon is a design for a complete desktop computer system from scratch.  Its simplicity and clarity enables a single person to know and implement the whole system, while still providing enough power to make it useful and usable in a production environment. This website contains information and resources for exploring and using the system.  The project is fully described in *Project Oberon: The Design of an Operating System, a Compiler, and a Computer* — written by the designers, Niklaus Wirth and Jürg Gutknecht. The second (2013) edition of the book and source code are published on [Prof. Wirth's website](http://www.inf.ethz.ch/personal/wirth/). We provide links to the original material here, and local zipped copies, with kind permission from the authors.
