# Home - CueCam Presenter

I don't know anything about football but here's how you could use CueCam for sports coaching.

I started with a clip of the team's game "from earlier". You probably have footage on your iPhone. I AirDropped this clip to Video Pencil to have more control on the iPad

I set up a trigger in CueCam to load and unload the video on the iPad

The next card shared a browser window and opened a YouTube link. Notice that you can hear the sound from YouTube.

I asked ChatGPT for an "inspirational speech" and put it on the next card.

There's some inspirational backing music to take it to the next level.

Finally, I used Live Titles in Video Pencil to add "Winners" onto the screen at the end.
