# AI assets are a legal risk & need to be banned from the marketplace - Marketplace - Epic Developer Community Forums

It is getting out of hand, the 2D section now consists ENTIRELY of AI generated images.

This does not only drag down the overall quality of the marketplace and ruin it for real 2D artists, it also puts the customers into legal danger AND breaks Epics own guidelines.

’

The marketplace guidelines state:

> **[2.2.b](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/marketplace-guidelines#22b)** Sellers must have legal rights to distribute all content of the products they submit to and distribute through the Marketplace.

AI art sellers are breaking this rule, as they do not own the rights to the AI generated images.

The US law is very clear on this, see section 306 & 313.2 of the [US copyright law compendium](https://www.copyright.gov/comp3/chap300/ch300-copyrightable-authorship.pdf):

> Works That Lack Human Authorship
> 
> As discussed in Section 306, the Copyright Act protects “original works of authorship.” 17 U.S.C. § 102(a) (emphasis added). To qualify as a work of “authorship” a work must be created by a human being.

Furthermore, judges have already rejected copyright claims for AI content: [AI-generated art cannot receive copyrights, US court says | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/legal/ai-generated-art-cannot-receive-copyrights-us-court-says-2023-08-21/)

So despite what companies like Midjourney are promising, they can not grant copyrights to the people using their tools.
And even slight edits like adding a frame or changing colors or brightness are not enough to constitute enough human input to be able to receive copyright.
Despite the fact that most AI assets sold on the marketplace are very clearly not edited at all.

So why is Epic allowing AI art on the marketplace, even though it clearly breaks their own guidelines?

.

The next problem is Valve banning games using AI generated content, with more and more people now reporting on Reddit their games being rejected by Steam due to AI generated content.

As to Valves stance on this, quote Valve in the [TechCrunch article](https://techcrunch.com/2023/07/03/valve-responds-to-claims-it-has-banned-ai-generated-games-from-steam/):

> “As the legal ownership of such AI-generated art is unclear, we cannot ship your game while it contains these AI-generated assets, unless you can affirmatively confirm that you own the rights to all of the IP used in the data set that trained the AI to create the assets in your game,”

&

> Again, while we strive to ship most titles submitted to us, we cannot ship games for which the developer does not have all of the necessary rights. At this time, we are declining to distribute your game since it’s unclear if the underlying AI tech used to create the assets has sufficient rights to the training data.

Valves stance is clear and logical, since no AI generator currently available (to the public) is being trained on datasets that do not contain public, copyrighted material.
Hence why there are multiple lawsuits pending & in preparation against companies like Midjourney.

So by allowing AI generated content to be sold on the marketplace, Epic is not only putting every customer into the danger of their games being rejected or banned from Steam, but also into legal risks as these asset sellers do not own the copyrights to these images.

As a customer, you put your trust into Epic for only allowing assets to be sold that do NOT put said customer into legal danger.
By continuing to allow AI generated assets to be sold, we as customers can not trust the Unreal marketplace any longer. If Epic doesn’t care about copyrights for AI assets, how can I trust it cares about the rights of other assets being sold on the marketplace?

.

Therefore, if Epic actually cares about us indie gamedevs who buy things on the marketplace - which I want to believe, it needs to ban AI generated assets from the marketplace.

Either that or put a big warning sign on any AI generated asset AND remove section 2.2.b from the guidelines, or make it clear that the guidelines actually don’t matter for sellers.

Which one is it going to be Epic?
