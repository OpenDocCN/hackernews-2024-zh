I need AI to waste energy. I need it to deprive vulnerable communities of water so that it can be used to cool new data centers. I need AI to make up answers to my questions.

I need AI to waste energy. I need it to deprive vulnerable communities of water so that it can be used to cool new data centers.

I need AI to make up answers to my questions.

I need AI to make up APIs and lower my code quality. I need it to repeatedly give me wrong answers until I realize I could have just written it myself.

I need AI to exploit publicly available content on the web without compensating any creators.

I need AI to deskill knowledge work and weaken labor.

I need AI to miscategorize images so we can apologize for it after the damage has been done.

I need AI to pilot autonomous vehicles that injure pedestrians and take jobs from taxi drivers and truckers.

I need AI to create more invasive and insidious advertising for things I don't need.

I need AI to do even more damage to the journalism industry and create content nobody can trust.

I need AI to produce gimmicky videos that threaten the jobs of creators and secure funding for the already wealthy.

I need AI that can't taste to create recipes.

I need AI that's never traveled to plan my vacation.

I need AI that can't appreciate music to recommend music for me.

I need AI to replace web search with answers I can't trust and with no benefit to content creators.

Life is short and I need AI to flood what time I have with more garbage to sift through.

Who **asked** for this?
