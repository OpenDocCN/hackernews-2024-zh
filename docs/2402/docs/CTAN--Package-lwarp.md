# CTAN: Package lwarp

> 来源：[https://ctan.org/pkg/lwarp](https://ctan.org/pkg/lwarp)

This package converts LaTeX to HTML by using LaTeX to process the user’s document and generate HTML tags. External utility programs are only used for the final conversion of text and images. Math may be represented by SVG files or MathJax. Hundreds of LaTeX packages are supported, and their load order is automatically verified.

Documents may be produced by LaTeX, LuaLaTeX, XeLaTeX, and by several CJK engines, classes, and packages. A `texlua` script automates compilation, index, glossary, and batch image processing, and also supports [latexmk](/pkg/latexmk). Configuration is semi-automatic at the first manual compile. Support files are self-generated. Print and HTML versions of each document may coexist.

Assistance is provided for HTML import into EPUB conversion software and word processors.

Requirements include the commonly-available Poppler utilities, and Perl. Detailed installation instructions are included for each of the major operating systems and TeX distributions. A quick-start tutorial is provided.
