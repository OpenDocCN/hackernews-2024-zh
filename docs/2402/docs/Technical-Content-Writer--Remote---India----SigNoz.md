**Company Vision**

Software and digital systems are becoming larger parts of our daily lives. Most companies are becoming software companies with increasing part of value they create coming from software.

In such a world, having software systems functioning seamlessly is taken for granted. Think about last time twitter or slack went down. How irritated you felt.

We aim to solve this problem by providing software engineers better tooling to keep systems running smoothly. We believe there are lots to be done in this space and we need your help in building this future.

**About the role**

A key part of this role is to reach all relevant developers and make them aware of SigNoz and our value prop. Creating great content and distributing it in channels where developers hang out is critical for this.

*   Create video tutorials or docs on common issues faced by users

    *   YouTube videos
    *   Improving our current docs
    *   Case studies
    *   Tutorials
    *   Social Media Posts
*   Distribute content in relevant forums and communities
