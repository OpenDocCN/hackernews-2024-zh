Free online course from Purdue University in collaboration with Intel Corporation, the University of Texas at Austin, and leading worldwide partners in the field*

The courses is designed for students and professionals who want to know how these essential physical building blocks of the digital age are made.

## Semiconductor Fabrication Course Description

Semiconductor electronics are the physical building blocks of the modern world. This course contains comprehensive engaging lectures on a variety of industry-standard semiconductor fabrication processes. They are also complemented by access and training in the vFabLab and video tutorials of the actual equipment and process technologies.

This course will effectively provide the best possible foundations of semiconductor fabrication to boost innovation, continuous improvement, and critical thinking. This will also enable you to identify the important factors, prioritize them, explore factor interactions, and determine robust solutions within the given context and resources. Very importantly it will let you learn not only by reading or listening, but it will also allow you to practice your understanding in the virtual cleanroom at your convenience from anywhere using any of your gadgets.
