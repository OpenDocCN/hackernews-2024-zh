Suikoden creator and Eiyuden Chronicle: Rising director Yoshitaka Murayama has passed away due to complications with an ongoing illness.

The Eiyuden Chronicle X/Twitter account announced Murayama passed away last week. "It’s with a heavy heart and deep sadness we must inform you that Yoshitaka Murayama, the scenario writer for Eiyuden Chronicle: Hundred Heroes and head of Rabbit & Bear Studios, passed away on February 6," it said.

Rabbit and Bear Studios, a studio Murayama created alongside other Suikoden veterans to make a spiritual successor series in Eiyuden Chronicle, also published a [statement](https://rabbitandbearstudios.com/%e7%9a%86%e6%a7%98%e3%81%b8%e5%a4%a7%e5%88%87%e3%81%aa%e3%81%8a%e7%9f%a5%e3%82%89%e3%81%9b/) to commemorate the famed developer.

"Murayama first began this journey of the creation of Eiyuden Chronicle: Hundred Heroes in 2020 through the support of his very loving fans on Kickstarter," it said. "Throughout the three-plus-year-development of the game, it was always the passion from his fans that continued to drive his creative vision and motivate him to put his all into the project.

"His hard work on Eiyuden Chronicle as scenario writer was finished but as his co-workers and friends, it saddens us to know that he won’t get to see the reactions from his fans. However, even with those feelings we need to accept the reality that he is no longer with us and continue to push his dream forward by releasing Eiyuden Chronicle to the world.

"We want to maintain his legacy and vision with this game and know that he would have wanted the rich world he has created with Eiyuden Chronicle to live on. His family sincerely appreciates your prayers and support but asks for privacy and that no flowers, mail, or other offerings be sent."

Rabbit and Bear said it will announce how Murayama's passing will affect logistics of the studio and Eiyuden Chronicle: Hundred Heroes at a later date.

Suikoden is one of the most beloved role-playing game series of all time, originally releasing in 1995 for the PlayStation. "Suikoden is undeniably one of the best RPGs ever made," [IGN said in our original review](/articles/1997/01/23/suikoden-2). "Not only that, but Suikoden isn't a game that can be finished in a few days either. Suikoden is long and it doesn't get boring... ever."

Eiyuden Chronicle: Rising arrived in 2022 as the first in the spiritual successor series, while [Eiyuden Chronicle: Hundred Heroes is just a couple of months away](/articles/eiyuden-chronicle-release-date-finally-announced-during-nintendo-direct) with a release date of April 23, 2024.
