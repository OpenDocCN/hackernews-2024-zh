| **iPod Pin** | **Pin Name** | **USB pin** | **usb color** |
| 1 | USB DATA - / Left Channel | 2 |  white |
| 2 | USB DATA + / Right Channel | 3 |  green |
| 3 | GND | Casing |  black |
| 4 | VCC | 1 |  red |

 Remember that this jack is also the headphone jack. The conversion from audio to USB data (+ and -) occurs in the circuit board within the adapter base.  Also there is a common diode between the VCC and GND to ensure perfect isolation of VCC.
