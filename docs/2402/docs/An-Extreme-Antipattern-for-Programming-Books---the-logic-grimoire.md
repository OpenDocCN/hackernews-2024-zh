# An Extreme Antipattern for Programming Books – the logic grimoire

> 来源：[https://logicgrimoire.wordpress.com/2023/12/05/an-extreme-antipattern-for-programming-books/](https://logicgrimoire.wordpress.com/2023/12/05/an-extreme-antipattern-for-programming-books/)

tl;dr: programming book authors: put all the code in the book!

An extreme antipattern for a programming book is “download the author’s idiosyncratic library code from some random URL and figure out how to load it on your system”. No, all code used in the book should be printed in the book itself, so the reader can type it in. The URLs always break. The libraries never load properly. A book should never depend on a URL. If you have a small idiosyncratic library, put it in an appendix. If you have a large idiosyncratic library, rewrite your code to be simpler

I know this is an extreme opinion. But I have looked at a lot of older technical books and those that avoid this bad pattern age well and can still be useful and interesting even decades later

Based on the evidence of the last 15 years, I am almost prepared to go fully to the most extreme “don’t put any URLs in Books at all” position because URLs in actual practice are just that bad.
