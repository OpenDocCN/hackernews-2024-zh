We often marvel and are amazed at a lot of young solopreneurs - Mark Z, Jeff Bezos, . But the reality is that despite what everyone tells you - there are a number of entrepeneurs who succeeded at a much later age. Many of these businesses were not possible before 30 without a tonne of business experience.

1.  **Ray Kroc** - Before transforming McDonald's into the world's leading fast-food franchise, Ray Kroc was selling milkshake machines. He didn't start McDonald's until he was in his 50s, proving that some entrepreneurial journeys start later in life but can still lead to global success.

2.  **Vera Wang** - Wang was a figure skater and journalist before entering the fashion industry. She did not open her own bridal boutique until she was 40, after being passed over for the editor-in-chief position at "Vogue". Wang's later-life career pivot into the fashion industry has made her one of its most iconic designers, especially in bridal wear.

3.  **Colonel Harland Sanders** - Sanders started franchising Kentucky Fried Chicken (KFC) at the age of 62, using his first Social Security check to fund the business. His story is a testament to the idea that it's never too late to start a business venture that can become a global phenomenon.

4.  **Julia Child** - Known for bringing French cuisine to the American audience, Julia Child published her first cookbook, "Mastering the Art of French Cooking," at 49 and became a television icon in her 50s. Her passion for food and cooking has made her a beloved figure worldwide.

5.  **Sam Walton** - Before becoming the founder of Walmart, Sam Walton owned a small chain of variety stores. He didn't open the first Walmart until he was 44 years old, in 1962\. Walton's vision for retail and his innovative approach to supply chain and store management revolutionized the retail industry and led Walmart to become the largest retailer in the world.
