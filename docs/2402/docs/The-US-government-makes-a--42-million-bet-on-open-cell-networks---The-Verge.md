# The US government makes a $42 million bet on open cell networks - The Verge

The US government has [committed $42 million](https://www.ntia.gov/press-release/2024/biden-harris-administration-awards-42m-wireless-innovation) to further the development of the 5G Open RAN (O-RAN) standard that would allow wireless providers to mix and match cellular hardware and software, opening up a bigger market for third-party equipment that’s cheaper and interoperable. The National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) grant would establish a Dallas O-RAN testing center to prove the standard’s viability as a way to head off Huawei’s steady cruise toward a global cellular network hardware monopoly.

Verizon global network and technology president Joe Russo [promoted the funding](https://go.redirectingat.com/?xs=1&id=1025X1701640&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.verizon.com%2Fabout%2Fnews%2Fnew-grant-ntia-o-ran-carriers-vendors-globally) as a way to achieve “faster innovation in an open environment.” To achieve the standard’s goals, AT&T vice president of RAN technology [Robert Soni says](https://about.att.com/blogs/2024/open-ran.html) that AT&T and Verizon have formed the Acceleration of Compatibility and Commercialization for Open RAN Deployments Consortium (ACCoRD), which includes a grab bag of wireless technology companies like Ericsson, Nokia, Samsung, Dell, Intel, Broadcom, and Rakuten.

Japanese wireless carrier Rakuten formed as the first O-RAN network in 2020\. The company’s then CEO, Tareq Amin, [told *The Verge*’s Nilay Patel](/23297756/5g-rakuten-mobile-ceo-oran-cloud-network-decoder) in 2022 that Open RAN would enable low-cost network build-outs using smaller equipment rather than massive towers — which has long been part of the promise of 5G.

But O-RAN is about more than that; establishing interoperability means companies like Verizon and AT&T wouldn’t be forced to buy all of their hardware from a single company to create a functional network. For the rest of us, that means faster build-outs and “more agile networks,” [according to Rakuten](https://symphony.rakuten.com/blog/open-ran-explained-all-you-need-to-know-and-more).

In the US, Dish has been working on its own O-RAN network, under the name Project Genesis. The 5G network was [creaky and unreliable](/2022/11/24/23445995/dish-5g-network-genesis-las-vegas-trial) when former *Verge* staffer Mitchell Clarke tried it out in Las Vegas in 2022, but the company said in June last year that it had [made its goal](/2023/6/15/23762646/dish-network-june-2023-boost-fcc-population-coverage-5g-genesis) of covering 70 percent of the US population. Dish has struggled to [become the next big cell provider](https://www.lightreading.com/open-ran/wall-street-is-fed-up-with-dish-network) in the US, though — leading satellite communications company EchoStar, which spun off from Dish in 2008, to [purchase the company](/2024/1/2/24022413/dish-network-echostar-acquisition-5g-boost-mobile-wireless) in January.

All of this adds up to a united front against Huawei’s domination of global cellular equipment and infrastructure. [*The Washington Post* writes](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/02/12/oran-biden-china-huawei-technology/) that O-RAN “is Washington’s anointed champion to try to unseat the Chinese tech giant Huawei Technologies” as the world’s biggest supplier of cellular infrastructure gear. The *Post* points out that Biden has made O-RAN a priority point of discussion with global leaders in recent years, and that both Congress and the NTIA have allocated around $2 billion for the advancement of the standard.

This $42 million grant is a drop in the bucket compared to all of that, but the establishment of a testing center is a key step in the process; it creates an arena where ACCoRD partners can establish that the standard can work and get the buy-in of other big players across the world. The *Post* notes that Ericsson and AT&T made big commitments in December, with [a $14 billion, five-year contract](https://about.att.com/story/2023/commercial-scale-open-radio-access-network.html) to infuse most or — in the case of Ericsson — all of their hardware with O-RAN compatibility within the next couple of years, giving the standard some hefty momentum.
