A so-called "Willy Wonka Experience" was shut down over the weekend, following numerous complaints from families. [Police were eventually called](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/czrlr3dw2x3o) over the complaints, which saw the families wanting full refunds from the House of Illuminati events company.

Want to hear the full story? Quiet up and listen down. Wait, scratch that! Reverse it! The event was said to be a *"journey filled with wondrous creations and enchanting surprises at every turn."* AI-generated art was used to advertise the event, but when families turned up, they saw some foam sweets, a bouncy castle, and little else that transformed the warehouse the event was held in.

A House of Illuminati spokesperson has apologised for the event in a [post on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/houseofilluminatiofficial), claiming that the organisers were let down at the last minute in many areas of the event. Full refunds are expected to be given out to everyone who attended, or those who weren't even able to see this experience due to it being cancelled midway through the day.

There's even a Facebook group chat for survivors of this event, so if you went to this world of anything but pure imagination, you can vent your trauma with them.
