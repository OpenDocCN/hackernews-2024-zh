# Apple Watch Ultra 2 Hacked - Apple Community

> 来源：[https://discussions.apple.com/thread/255453237](https://discussions.apple.com/thread/255453237)

Yes, it's kind of spooky, this one, isn't it? It just happened to me on my Ultra 2, and it's easy to believe that it's somebody else trying to manipulate your watch, because it's a lot of random screen presses and swipes (which is, of course, the main way of interacting with the watch).

What actually gets triggered will depend on things like which complications you have on the display. For mine, it kept starting lots of timers, which then of course started buzzing and flashing as they went off...

And if, like me, you take your watch off to try other solutions, then of course, the random screen taps will quickly result in a keypad asking you to enter your PIN, and you'll see what looks like somebody trying lots and lots of attempts to hack into your watch...

I haven't ever seen something like that on an Apple product before, so it was pretty wild!

But I noted the earlier comment that a recent software update supposedly contains a fix for this, and by resetting a few times and putting the watch on its charger, I managed to get it to recover to the point where I could do the software update. So far, it now seems fine. We shall see... :-)
