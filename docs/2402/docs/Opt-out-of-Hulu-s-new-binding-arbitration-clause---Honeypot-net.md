# Opt out of Hulu's new binding arbitration clause | Honeypot.net

> 来源：[https://honeypot.net/post/opt-out-of-hulus-new-binding-arbitration-clause/](https://honeypot.net/post/opt-out-of-hulus-new-binding-arbitration-clause/)

Hulu’s [new subscriber agreement](https://www.hulu.com/subscriber_agreement) claims to require users to resolve significant disputes through arbitration. It specifically prevents us from participating in class action lawsuits:

> ANY DISPUTE BETWEEN YOU AND US, EXCEPT FOR SMALL CLAIMS, IS SUBJECT TO A CLASS ACTION WAIVER AND MUST BE RESOLVED BY INDIVIDUAL BINDING ARBITRATION.

This is a terrible deal for users. ^(Hulu gets the right to hire someone to settle disputes. We lose the right to protect ourselves as a group if Hulu does something horrible that hurts us.)

They provide a method for rejecting these clauses in [section 7](https://www.hulu.com/subscriber_agreement#section7), subsection 7 “Opt-out.” If you wish to retain your legal rights, you have to send them a physical letter stating that you wish to opt out of both the arbitration agreement and the class action waiver. This is the letter I’m sending them:

> Me
> 123 Main St.
> Tampa, FL
> [me@example.com](mailto:me@example.com)
> 
> February 1, 2024
> 
> Disney Opt-Out
> P.O. Box 11565
> Burbank, CA, 91510
> 
> Dear Opt-Out Team:
> 
> I am opting out of the Hulu Subscriber Agreement’s arbitration agreement and class action waiver.
> 
> Sincerely,
>

I highly recommend you send your version of this ~~typo: email~~ physical mail to Hulu. Otherwise, you’ll lose important legal rights to protect yourself legally if Hulu acts in a way that harms you.
