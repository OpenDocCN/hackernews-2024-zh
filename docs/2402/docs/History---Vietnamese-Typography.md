In 1907, Vietnamese scholars such as Lương Văn Can, Nguyễn Quyền, and Dương Bá Trạc opened Đông Kinh nghĩa thục, a tuition-free institution in Hà Nội to help progress the country. Recognizing the advantage of *Quốc ngữ*, which was easy to read and write, the school used the Romanized writing system to publish textbooks, literary works, and newspapers (Đăng cổ Tùng báo and Đại Việt Tân báo).

Around the same time in 1907, Journalist Nguyễn Văn Vĩnh opened the first printing company and published the first independent newspaper called Đăng cổ tùng báo in Hà Nội. In 1913, he published Đông dương Tạp chí to propagate *Quốc ngữ*. Both Nguyễn Văn Vĩnh and Trương Vĩnh Ký were known as the godfathers of the Vietnamese newspapers.

From 1917 to 1934, Writer Phạm Quỳnh contributed many important essays on literature and philosophy in his own publication called Nam Phong tạp chí. He also translated many French literary works into *Quốc ngữ*.

In 1933, the forming of Tự Lực Văn Đoàn (Self-Reliance Literary Group) signified profound changes in the Vietnamese literary scene. The group’s scholars, which made up of Nhất Linh, Khái Hưng, Hoàng Đạo, Thạch Lam, Tú Mỡ, Thế Lữ, and Xuân Diệu, popularized *Quốc ngữ* through their clear, simple Vietnamese writing. They published two weekly newspapers (Phong hóa and Ngày nay), modern poetry, and novels without relying on the Chinese classical text.^([5](#history5))
