    at the time, “we’re trying to get information out of people’s heads, so it’s not

    format to make a valuable database.” Their plan was to persuade experts in specialized
    fields to share their insights with knowledge-seekers and, from there, build a
    vibrant community around this free exchange of authentic information. “There were
    a lot of high-quality answers from people who wanted to just share their experiences,”

  zh: 然后是前顶级作者 J. Starr 所描述的“优化信息流”。起初，当用户登录Quora时，他们看到的是他们来这里寻找的问题：等待回答的问题。但很快，网站开始“将‘内容’文章放入每个人的信息流中”，充斥着根据Starr说法，“只是废话，关于好莱坞人物的八卦文章”。这似乎是当前所有大写字母公告围绕查尔斯国王的前兆。
- en: There were early problems with ads and bots too. When Quora started putting
    ads on the site in 2016, Williams and other Top Writers suggested that there be
    some sort of creator revenue-sharing program, she told me. As a result, higher-ups
    created “the [Quora partner program](https://quorapartners.quora.com/), which
    I joined myself,” Williams said. But that “was all about trying to come up with
    questions that would draw in more views and more people,” she said—not about incentivizing
    high-quality answers. It was all about adding webpages of individual questions,
    for SEO purposes.

  zh: 在早期，Quora 也存在着广告和机器人的问题。当Quora 于2016年开始在网站上放置广告时，Williams 和其他顶级作者建议设立某种创作者分成计划，她告诉我。因此，管理层创建了“[Quora
    合作伙伴计划](https://quorapartners.quora.com/)，我自己也加入了其中”，Williams 说道。但她表示，“这完全是为了设计能够吸引更多点击和人流的问题”，而非鼓励高质量回答。这一切都是为了增加个别问题的网页，以提升SEO效果。
- en: And Quora “partners” weren’t the only ones being recruited to this task—the
    site also attracted bots that would pull questions from Reddit threads onto Quora
    pages. They weren’t the type of questions the Quora community was looking for.
    “You would have people creating bots with templates of ‘What are the best places
    to eat at,’ and then it would put in city names, state, country names,” Williams
    said. ([Redditors on r/Quora](https://www.reddit.com/r/quora/comments/gb495s/bots_asking_the_questions/)
    began to notice and complain about this practice.)

  zh: 而且 Quora 的“合作伙伴”并非唯一受到招募的人士——该网站还吸引了机器人，这些机器人会从Reddit帖子中获取问题并放到Quora页面上。这些并非Quora社区所期望的问题。“你会看到人们使用模板创建机器人，比如‘在哪里吃最好’，然后它会填入城市名字、州名字、国家名字”，Williams
    说道。([Reddit 上的 r/Quora](https://www.reddit.com/r/quora/comments/gb495s/bots_asking_the_questions/)

    said [Bethann Siviter](https://www.quora.com/profile/Bethann-Siviter), another
    former Top Writer. “With the partner program, it became clear that quantity meant
    more than quality. You could report people over and over, and nothing happened.”
    Even though the partner program [didn’t earn participants](https://medium.com/swlh/the-hard-truth-about-the-new-quora-partner-program-5e3229ae83c5)
    all that much money (maybe a few thousand dollars at most), the people who made

    of service and did away with BNBR, then automated the moderation process. Needless
    to say, it did not improve the situation on the site. Nor did the integrated A.I.
    chatbots offer good questions or answers. Instead, they “made up some really generic,
    and oftentimes first-grade-level questions,” wrote user [Steven P. Robinson](https://www.quora.com/profile/Steven-P-Robinson)
    in an email. “It is a good example of A.I. not being ready for prime time.” Now
