    was that it was *designed* with social networking in mind. Co-founders Adam D’Angelo
    and Charlie Cheever were both early Facebook employees who quit in 2009 in order
    to build a website where, as [they told TechCrunch](https://techcrunch.com/2010/03/28/quora-has-the-magic-benchmark-invests-at-86-million-valuation/)
    at the time, “we’re trying to get information out of people’s heads, so it’s not
    on sources that are hard to access on the internet, and get it into a really useful
    format to make a valuable database.” Their plan was to persuade experts in specialized
    fields to share their insights with knowledge-seekers and, from there, build a
    vibrant community around this free exchange of authentic information. “There were
    a lot of high-quality answers from people who wanted to just share their experiences,”
    said Friedman—a feature that stood in stark contrast with Yahoo Answers, which
    “never built up that community.”
