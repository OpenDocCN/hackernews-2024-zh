  zh: 谷歌过去曾表示，它并非由中央情报局资助或创建。例如，当2006年流传出谷歌多年来为协助反恐工作而从情报界获得资助的报道时，该公司告诉《有线》杂志创始人约翰·巴泰尔：“[关于谷歌的声明完全不实](http://battellemedia.com/archives/2006/11/google_on_cia_untrue.php)。”

    No. But were Brin and Page researching precisely what the NSA, the CIA, and the
    intelligence community hoped for, assisted by their grants? Absolutely.

  zh: 中央情报局直接资助布林和佩奇的工作，从而创造了Google吗？没有。但布林和佩奇是否正在研究情报局、中央情报局和情报界希望的精确内容，并在他们的资助下进行？绝对是。
- en: 'To understand this significance, you have to consider what the intelligence
    community was trying to achieve as it seeded grants to the best computer-science
    minds in academia: The CIA and NSA funded an unclassified, compartmentalized program
    designed from its inception to spur the development of something that looks almost
    exactly like Google. Brin’s breakthrough research on page ranking by tracking
    user queries and linking them to the many searches conducted—essentially identifying
    “birds of a feather”—was largely the aim of the intelligence community’s MDDS
    program. And Google succeeded beyond their wildest dreams.'

  zh: 要理解这一重要性，你必须考虑情报界试图实现的目标，因为他们向学术界最优秀的计算机科学家投放了资助：中央情报局（CIA）和国家安全局（NSA）资助了一个非机密、分隔式的计划，旨在推动类似Google的发展。布林通过跟踪用户查询并将其链接到许多进行的搜索来进行的页面排名的突破性研究，实质上是识别“志同道合者”，基本上是情报界MDDS计划的目标。而Google的成功远超过了他们最疯狂的梦想。

    as they now relate to the Patriot Act. “Hastily passed 45 days after 9/11 in the
    name of national security, the Patriot Act was the first of many changes to surveillance
    laws that made it easier for the government to spy on ordinary Americans by expanding
    the authority to monitor phone and email communications, collect bank and credit
    reporting records, and track the activity of innocent Americans on the Internet,”
    [says the ACLU.](https://www.aclu.org/issues/national-security/privacy-and-surveillance/surveillance-under-patriot-act)
    “While most Americans think it was created to catch terrorists, the Patriot Act
    actually turns regular citizens into suspects.”

- en: But even a cursory glance through recent public records shows that there is
    a treadmill of constant requests that could undermine the intent behind this privacy
    promise. According to the data-request records that the companies make available
    to the public, in the most recent reporting period between 2016 and 2017, local,
    state and federal government authorities seeking information related to national
    security, counter-terrorism or criminal concerns issued [more than 260,000 subpoenas,
    court orders, warrants, and other legal requests](http://transparency.verizon.com/us-data)
    to Verizon, more than [250,000 such requests](http://about.att.com/content/csr/home/frequently-requested-info/governance/transparencyreport.html)
    to AT&T, and nearly [24,000 subpoenas, search warrants, or court orders](http://www.google.com/transparencyreport/userdatarequests/US/)
    to Google. Direct national security or counter-terrorism requests are a small
    fraction of this overall group of requests, but the Patriot Act legal process
    has now become so routinized that the companies each have a group of employees
    who simply take care of the stream of requests.

    science and tech companies has been wildly successful. When national security
