    Richard Wilkinson'One of the most talked-about books to the moment … Limitarianism
    floats the heretical idea that fixing society isn’t just about saving the poorest
    from destitution, but about putting a cap on how much the richest are able to
    own' SpectatorNo-one deserves to be a millionaire.

    most of us, daily life doesn't change. Or at least, not immediately. In this astonishing,

    exposes the true extent of our wealth problem, which has spent the past fifty
    years silently spiralling out of control.

    she shows, extreme wealth is not only unjustifiable but harmful to us all - the
    rich included. In place of our current system, Robeyns offers a breathtakingly
    clear alternative: limitarianism.'

- en: The answer to so many of the problems posed by neoliberal capitalism - and the
    opportunity for a vastly better world - lies in placing a hard limit on the wealth
    that any one person can accumulate. Because nobody deserves to be a millionaire.
    Not even you. *Shortlisted for the Socrates Philosophy Prize*
