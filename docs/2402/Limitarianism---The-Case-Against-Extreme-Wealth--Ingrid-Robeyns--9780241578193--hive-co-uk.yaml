    Richard Wilkinson'One of the most talked-about books to the moment … Limitarianism

    years silently spiralling out of control.

    she shows, extreme wealth is not only unjustifiable but harmful to us all - the
    rich included. In place of our current system, Robeyns offers a breathtakingly
    clear alternative: limitarianism.'

    opportunity for a vastly better world - lies in placing a hard limit on the wealth
    that any one person can accumulate. Because nobody deserves to be a millionaire.
