- en: 'Anthony C. Hay was a programmer at Digital Research and Novell. He has a BSc
    in Computer Science from Imperial College, London. His first programs were toggled
    into a homemade 6800 computer in 1977\. Anthony has written a near-perfect clone
    of the original MAD-SLIP ELIZA in C++, which can be found here: [https://github.com/anthay/ELIZA](https://github.com/anthay/ELIZA).
    This was based initially on Weizenbaum''s 1966 ELIZA paper in CACM, and then corrected
    after the MAD-SLIP source code for ELIZA was discovered in Weizenbaum''s MIT archive.'

- en: Peter Millican originally studied Mathematics at Oxford, but changed subject
    owing to fascination with Philosophy. After postgraduate studies, he started taking
    a serious interest in computers, which led to a permanent lectureship in Computing
    and Philosophy at Leeds University in 1985\. Much of his work there was devoted
    to interdisciplinary links, and in 2000 he created his Elizabeth chatbot program
    (a more powerful ELIZA) to attract humanities students. In 2005 he was appointed
    at Hertford College in Oxford, becoming Professor of Philosophy in 2010, and in
    2012 he started the Oxford joint degree in Computer Science & Philosophy. Elizabeth
    now plays a large role in Oxford's outreach activities, and can be found at [https://www.philocomp.net/ai/elizabeth.htm](https://www.philocomp.net/ai/elizabeth.htm)

- en: Jeff Shrager ([http://shrager.org](http://shrager.org)) is the current editor/curator
    of ELIZAgen.org. He is a dad and an aging Lisp hacker; Indeed, he and Lisp are
    about the same age! Jeff has been fascinated by AI since childhood when he wrote
    [a bad ELIZA knock-off in BASIC](/view/elizagen-org/eliza-clones) which, through
    its synchronicity with the personal computer revolution, became the root of a
    huge branch of bad ELIZA knock-offs. In 2021 Jeff re-discovered [Wiezenbaum's
    orginal MAD-SLIP ELIZA](/view/elizagen-org/original-eliza) in the Weizenbaum archives
    at MIT. Jeff has co-authored over 100 AI-related publications in fields ranging
    from mathematics to medicine, and co-founded three biomedical AI startups. At
    the moment he's an Adjunct Professor in the Symbolic Systems Program at Stanford,
    where he teaches, among other things, Human-AI Interaction Analysis, and Chief
    Scientist of Blue Dot Change, where he runs a lab working on removing methane,
    the strongest greenhouse gas, from the atmosphere.

    software developer and technical lead working in the aerospace and automotive
    industries with experience in software architecting, modeling, and algorithm development
    and design. He has developed a version of SLIP called gSlip in the public domain.
    His active interests are in hashing algorithms, Eliza, and development of analysis
    software for anomaly detection. Past algorithm work has been presented in webinars
    for the Association of Old Crows, a worldwide SIGINT community, on binary searching
    of overlapping intervals on the real line.

- en: Peggy Weil ([pweilstudio.com](http://pweilstudio.com/)) is an multidisciplinary
    artist whose work addresses our changing physical, digital and sociopolitical
    landscapes. Her work spans interactive digital and immersive technologies, serious
    games, virtual environments, film and performance, including, the first net-art
    chatbot, MrMind.  She did her graduate work at the Architecture Machine Group/MIT
    Media Lab in the early 80’s, which provided an early introduction to the technologies
    and issues of human/machine interaction, digital media, AI, telepresence and immersive
    and virtual environments. She has taught at UCLA Design Media Arts, California
    College of the Arts, and is currently Adjunct Assistant Professor at USC School
    of Cinematic Arts.
