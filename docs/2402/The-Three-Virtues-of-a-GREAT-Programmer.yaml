    there are **three great virtues of a programmer**; Laziness, Impatience and Hubris

- en: '**Laziness**: The quality that makes you go to great effort to reduce overall
    energy expenditure. It makes you write labor-saving programs that other people
    will find useful and document what you wrote so you don''t have to answer so many
    questions about it.'

- en: '**Impatience**: The anger you feel when the computer is being lazy. This makes
    you write programs that don''t just react to your needs, but actually anticipate
    them. Or at least pretend to.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Hubris**: The quality that makes you write (and maintain) programs that other
    people won''t want to say bad things about.'
