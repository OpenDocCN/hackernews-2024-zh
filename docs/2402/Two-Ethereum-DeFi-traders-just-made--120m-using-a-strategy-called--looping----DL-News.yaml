    and [0x74](https://etherscan.io/address/0x741aa7cfb2c7bf2a1e7d4da2e3df6a56ca4131f3),

    — worth $3 billion. Both wallets are deposited in a handful of lending protocols

    for $600 million worth of Ether. Now, that risky bet has paid off.

    — employ is commonly referred to in DeFi as looping.

- en: A trader deposits an asset, such as Ether, into a lending protocol and then
    borrows a different asset, like dollar-pegged stablecoin DAI, against their deposit.
    They then swap that DAI for Ether, the original asset.

- en: After swapping cryptocurrencies, the trader re-deposits the newly-acquired Ether
    back into the lending protocol. This action allows them to borrow additional funds,
    establishing what’s called a ‘leveraged long position’ on their original Ether
    deposit.

    capital by a factor of 3 to 5 times — on their initial investment.

    of 1-2x. Despite its potential for higher returns, this strategy carries a multitude
    of risks. A significant drop in the Ether price could lead to liquidation, resulting
    in the loss of the initial deposit.

    around $1,000\. Ether is currently trading around $2,700\. The price of Ether
    would have to drop over 60% for them to be liquidated.
