    and [0x74](https://etherscan.io/address/0x741aa7cfb2c7bf2a1e7d4da2e3df6a56ca4131f3),
    have used various lending protocols to increase their exposure to Ether.

    — worth $3 billion. Both wallets are deposited in a handful of lending protocols
    like [MakerDAO](https://makerdao.com/en/), [Spark](https://spark.fi/), [Morpho](https://morpho.org/)

    attention in 2022 for nearly [being liquidated](https://twitter.com/RuneKek/status/1484654546529968133?lang=en)
    for $600 million worth of Ether. Now, that risky bet has paid off.

- en: The strategy these whales — a term for high-value crypto traders or investors
    — employ is commonly referred to in DeFi as looping.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A trader deposits an asset, such as Ether, into a lending protocol and then
    borrows a different asset, like dollar-pegged stablecoin DAI, against their deposit.
    They then swap that DAI for Ether, the original asset.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: After swapping cryptocurrencies, the trader re-deposits the newly-acquired Ether
    back into the lending protocol. This action allows them to borrow additional funds,
    establishing what’s called a ‘leveraged long position’ on their original Ether
    deposit.

    capital by a factor of 3 to 5 times — on their initial investment.

    of 1-2x. Despite its potential for higher returns, this strategy carries a multitude
    of risks. A significant drop in the Ether price could lead to liquidation, resulting
    in the loss of the initial deposit.

- en: The pair of whales deployed these strategies years ago when Ether was worth
    around $1,000\. Ether is currently trading around $2,700\. The price of Ether
    would have to drop over 60% for them to be liquidated.

    Arbitrum and Optimism. After successful tests on two of Ethereum’s test networks,
    the upgrade is slated to come to Ethereum mainnet around March 13.

    or 3.53% of the total supply, traders are hoping an Ether ETF would see a similar
    success.
