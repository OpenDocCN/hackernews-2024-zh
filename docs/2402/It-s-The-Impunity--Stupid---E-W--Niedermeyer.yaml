    what it said it was doing, I spent a long weekend [discovering](https://dailykanban.com/2015/05/27/tesla-battery-swap-unused-over-busy-holiday-weekend/)
    that its revolutionary battery swap station was [a sham designed to rip off California’s
    Zero Emission Vehicle program](https://dailykanban.com/2015/05/27/analysis-understanding-teslas-potemkin-swap-station/).
    That one encounter at a truck stop in the middle of the Central Valley introduced
    me to the toxic core of Tesla’s profoundly cynical culture: a sham technology
    propping up a fake environmental mission, ripping off public subsidies in order
    to appear more economically viable than it was. It was a jarring glimpse of an
    embryonic monster that, after nearly a decade of metastasizing growth, now looms
    over our political and economic system.'

    bigger surprise came when [I reached out to the California Air Resources Board](https://dailykanban.com/2015/06/23/tesla-battery-swap-carbs-bridge-to-nowhere/)
    to inform them of my findings and get their perspective on what seemed to me to
    be a blatant fraud. As it turned out, CARB staff had already grown concerned that
    Tesla was gaming the credit system and had recommended the loophole it was exploiting
    be closed. Instead, the board chose a fig-leaf tweak to the policy that staff
    said failed to adequately address their concerns, and effectively allowed Tesla
    to continue raking in ill-gotten credits from their fake swap system until the
    loophole they were exploiting sundowned.

    Yeah it’s a problem, was the vibe, but we can’t let that distract from all the
    good the ZEV program (and by extension, Tesla, its greatest beneficiary) is doing.

    effectively said the same thing. Multiple NHTSA administrators have described
    “holding back innovation” as the worst possible outcome, and failed to act even
    as their colleagues at NTSB proved Autopilot was contributing to novel forms of
    fatal car crashes. The SEC has flailed in the face of Musk’s blatant stock manipulation
    on Twitter, obviously cowed by Musk’s facile blustering about “free speech.” Again
    and again, in area after area, society’s guardians have chosen to excuse (or simply
    go easy on) crime after crime.

    keep polluted water from moving beyond the factory property. The maximum concentrations
    of dangerous pollutants reported are absolutely eye-popping: 7.6 mg of gasoline,
    4.5 mg of diesel, and nearly 13 mg of motor oil were reported per liter of water,
    the legal limit for all of which is 100 micrograms per liter. Maximum concentrations
    of Benzene, Ethylbenzene, TCE, PCE, Arsenic, and 1,4 dioxane were all massively
    beyond the legal limits. As far as I’m aware, nobody has reported seriously on

    at 101 sites across the state over five years. But despite the fact that such
    “intentional and negligent” dumping is supposed to carry massive fines for each
    incident at each site and for each day a violation goes unreported and unremediated,
    the counties [settled a day later for a pathetic $1.5 million](https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/01/tesla-settles-california-hazardous-waste-lawsuit-with-a-1-5-million-fine/).
    $200,000 of that covered the cost of a six-year investigation that found Tesla

    just at its factory but at its retail stores and other facilities as well.

    ignores environmental laws across every aspect of its business. Of course, these
    are two sides of the same coin: because Tesla knows the cost of violations is
    so low, it makes effectively no effort to meaningfully comply with any environmental
    law. If you’ve ever wondered how Tesla makes money on EVs when nobody else can,
    the fact that it has a free pass to violate every environmental law on the books
