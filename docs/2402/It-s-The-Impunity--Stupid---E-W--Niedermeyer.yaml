    be a blatant fraud. As it turned out, CARB staff had already grown concerned that
    Tesla was gaming the credit system and had recommended the loophole it was exploiting
    be closed. Instead, the board chose a fig-leaf tweak to the policy that staff
    said failed to adequately address their concerns, and effectively allowed Tesla
