- en: A [recent merge](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/merge_requests/27628)
    request on the Mesa Git repository added the initial support for allowing drivers
    to chose Zink as the translation layer for handling OpenGL. This basically does
    an OpenGL-on-Vulkan implementation making it easier for newer cards to support
    OpenGL through a generic implementation, reducing duplicate code and making it
    easier to keep OpenGL around since while not yet deprecated it is being less used
    on modern games.

- en: The merge allows owners of the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 20xx series GPUs and newer
    to opt to use Zink instead of relying on the default NVC0 Gallium3D implementation
    to handle OpenGL requests. Those who want to give it a try, it should be as simple
    as setting the `NOUVEAU_USE_ZINK=1` environment variable after updating Mesa 24.1
    when your distribution receives the update that is currently only on the main
    branch of Mesa repository.

- en: Since the merge from branch `airlied/zink-driver-choice` to `main` was merged
    [2 days ago](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/merge_requests/27628#note_null),
    most distros might not be distributing those patches yet. For those who use source-based
    distros or any source-base package building system like AUR, the package `mesa-git`
    is [available](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/mesa-git) as a means of tracking
    the main branch and testing these bleeding-edge features.

    about NVK work and thanks to some recent changes mentioned that "As a result,
    all GL games now work on NVK. No hyperbole. They just work".
