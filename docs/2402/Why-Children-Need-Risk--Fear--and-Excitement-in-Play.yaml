    at the University of British Columbia. As long as I was flying out to Vancouver,
    I wanted to meet Professor [Mariana Brussoni](https://spph.ubc.ca/faculty/mariana-brussoni/),
    who had been writing important work on the value of outdoor risky play. Our hour-long
    meeting expanded my thinking about risk and play, and helped me write Chapters
    2 and 3 of [The Anxious Generation](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/729231/the-anxious-generation-by-jonathan-haidt/). 
    Mariana quickly joined my pantheon of experts on play, along with Lenore Skenazy
    and Peter Gray. With articles such as [Play Worth Remembering: Are Playgrounds
    Too Safe](https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.7721/chilyoutenvi.26.1.0017)? and [Risky
    Play and Children’s Safety: Balancing Priorities for Optimal Child Development](https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/9/9/3134),
    Mariana makes the case that we harm children’s social, physical, and even immune
    development when we remove all risk from their lives. I liked Mariana and her
    work so much that I gave her an open-ended invitation to write whatever she wanted
    at After Babel. Here is her essay, laying out her findings in a format that parents
    and schools can use. A concise summary of her work is this simple sentence, which
    she said to me during our meeting: “Children should be kept as safe as necessary,
    not as safe as possible.”*'

    create environments where children and youth thrive. When we don’t, the consequences

    chances of getting hurt are higher than if they’re more sedentary and playing
    quietly. On the surface, it’s not clear why a need for risky play would evolve
    across species, if it increases the chances that something bad will happen to
    those who partake in it. But when we dig a little deeper, its benefits become
    obvious. Risky play provides children with low-cost opportunities to develop the
    physical and cognitive skills to master the challenges that they will face as
    they grow older. So, those who engaged in it had a major [evolutionary advantage](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/147470491100900212)
    over those who did not.   Physically, risky play allows children to explore more
    diverse movements and gain physical movement skills. [Cognitively](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/21594937.2022.2152531),

  zh: '***空间:*** 孩子们需要易于进入的刺激性游戏空间；灵活的空间，让他们可以发挥想象力，探索风险，而不是被无聊的游乐设施和严格的规则所主导的空间。不幸的是，随着越来越多的停车场和高速公路的建设以应对增加的汽车数量，这些类型的空间越来越少。在立法层面，我们需要摆脱把汽车置于人们之上的市政规划，这是许多北美城市已经迈出的重要一步。在法规之外，即使是在有限的空间中，个人也可以做很多事情。例如，“松散部件”（如树枝、木材、石头、盒子和防水布）可以把无聊和贫瘠的游戏空间变成快乐和奇迹的地方。尽管这些东西对成年人来说可能看起来像垃圾，但孩子们却喜欢它们。苏格兰为想要开始的任何人开发了
    [松散部件工具包](https://www.inspiringscotland.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Loose-Parts-Play-Toolkit-2019-web.pdf)。一些城市还有冒险游乐场——以儿童为中心、由儿童主导的游戏空间，充满了松散部件。
    （这样的游乐场总是有成人工作人员在场，但工作人员只在严重的安全风险出现时才会介入。）例如纽约的 [play:groundnyc](https://www.play-ground.nyc/)。'

    The biggest barrier to children’s freedom is us—the adults in their lives—and
    our need to manage our own fears. Getting over these fears can be difficult, but
    it is much easier when you work together with other parents. Peter Gray suggests
    that building tighter relationships with neighbors can help parents feel more
    confident about letting their kids out to play. The U.S. organization [Let Grow](https://letgrow.org/)
    works with parents and schools to help support an independent childhood. For parents
    working to manage their fears and change their approach to play, our lab developed
    the [OutsidePlay.org](https://outsideplay.org/) parent tool to help them work
    through their challenges, figure out what works best for them and develop a plan
    for change. We’ve tested it rigorously and [it works](https://www.jmir.org/2021/4/e24861/).'

  zh: '***自由：*** 孩子们需要自由来选择他们想要玩的方式。儿童自由的最大障碍是我们——他们生活中的成年人——以及我们管理自己恐惧的需要。克服这些恐惧可能很困难，但与其他父母一起合作会更容易。彼得·格雷建议，与邻居建立更紧密的关系可以帮助父母更自信地让孩子出去玩耍。美国组织[Let
    Grow](https://letgrow.org/)与家长和学校合作，支持孩子们独立的童年。对于努力管理自己的恐惧并改变玩耍方式的父母，我们的实验室开发了[OutsidePlay.org](https://outsideplay.org/)的家长工具，帮助他们克服挑战，找出最适合他们的方法，并制定变革计划。我们已经对其进行了严格测试，[它有效](https://www.jmir.org/2021/4/e24861/)。'
- en: Creating environments for children to thrive doesn’t have to feel overwhelming
    or unattainable. Every change begins with one small and manageable step. We each
    have to choose what this looks like for us. We owe it to our children to prioritize
    play and freedom in their lives and everyday realities. We’ve already seen what
    happens when we don’t. Let’s break out of the paradox, and give children the freedom
    they need to thrive.

  zh: 创建让儿童茁壮成长的环境并不一定让人感到无法实现或不堪重负。每一个变革都始于一个小而可控的步骤。我们每个人都必须选择这对我们来说是什么样子。我们有责任为我们的孩子们优先考虑游戏和自由，使其成为他们生活和日常现实的一部分。我们已经看到了当我们不这样做时会发生什么。让我们打破这种悖论，给孩子们他们需要茁壮成长所需的自由。
