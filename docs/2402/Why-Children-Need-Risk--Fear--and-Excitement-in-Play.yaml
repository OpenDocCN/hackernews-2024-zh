    at the University of British Columbia. As long as I was flying out to Vancouver,
    I wanted to meet Professor [Mariana Brussoni](https://spph.ubc.ca/faculty/mariana-brussoni/),
    who had been writing important work on the value of outdoor risky play. Our hour-long
    meeting expanded my thinking about risk and play, and helped me write Chapters
    2 and 3 of [The Anxious Generation](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/729231/the-anxious-generation-by-jonathan-haidt/). 
    Mariana quickly joined my pantheon of experts on play, along with Lenore Skenazy
    and Peter Gray. With articles such as [Play Worth Remembering: Are Playgrounds
    Too Safe](https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.7721/chilyoutenvi.26.1.0017)? and [Risky
    Play and Children’s Safety: Balancing Priorities for Optimal Child Development](https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/9/9/3134),
    Mariana makes the case that we harm children’s social, physical, and even immune
    development when we remove all risk from their lives. I liked Mariana and her
    work so much that I gave her an open-ended invitation to write whatever she wanted
    at After Babel. Here is her essay, laying out her findings in a format that parents
    and schools can use. A concise summary of her work is this simple sentence, which
    she said to me during our meeting: “Children should be kept as safe as necessary,
    not as safe as possible.”*'

    safe and ensure their success. We are also often terrified that they will get
    hurt and that they will fail—so we do everything we can to prevent that from happening.
    Yet many of those very efforts to manage our fears have paradoxically reduced
    our children’s safety and their odds of success.

    development, injury prevention, and outdoor risky play. I have learned that when
    we prioritize children’s play (especially the kind of play that involves some
    risk and lack of supervision) and the freedom to play how they choose, we help
    create environments where children and youth thrive. When we don’t, the consequences
    can be dire.

    allowed indoors. They felt independent, taking risks and figuring things out for
    themselves. And this is the kind of childhood that has [been common](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2013-01219-022)

    since the 1970s has seen their outdoor play and freedom shrink. Time use data
    show that children’s leisure time has gone down, particularly time spent in unstructured
    outdoor play, while time spent in academic and screen-based activities has increased.
    [Between 1975 and 2015](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/1468-4446.12369),
    outdoor play among UK children decreased by 29.4%, while screen-based activities
    increased by 22.4%. [In the U.S](https://europepmc.org/article/med/20852679).,
    only 16% of children in 1997 played outdoors every day. By 2003—just six years
    later—that dropped even further to 10%.

    no accident. Children are wired for [risky play](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/14729670802702762),

    independently (e.g., playing in their neighborhood with no adult supervision),
    and play with impact (e.g., jumping into a lake). This kind of play involves children
    pushing themselves beyond their previous limits and not knowing how things will

    chances of getting hurt are higher than if they’re more sedentary and playing
    quietly. On the surface, it’s not clear why a need for risky play would evolve
    across species, if it increases the chances that something bad will happen to
    those who partake in it. But when we dig a little deeper, its benefits become
    obvious. Risky play provides children with low-cost opportunities to develop the
    physical and cognitive skills to master the challenges that they will face as
    they grow older. So, those who engaged in it had a major [evolutionary advantage](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/147470491100900212)
    over those who did not.   Physically, risky play allows children to explore more
    diverse movements and gain physical movement skills. [Cognitively](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/21594937.2022.2152531),
    it helps them overcome their fears, build their critical thinking skills, and
    become accustomed to coping independently with difficult situations.

    and the cognitive distortions that go along with them. Anxious children have difficulty
    tolerating uncertainty, tend to interpret ambiguity negatively and underestimate
    their ability to cope in uncertain situations. Through risky play, children practice
    dealing with strong ambiguous emotions (thrill and excitement could also be interpreted
    as fear and terror) and situations that abound with uncertainty. It can also show
    them that they are resilient and capable of coping when things go wrong. [Research](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10578-022-01363-2)
    shows that children with more opportunities for risky play have lower internalizing
    symptoms that are characteristic of anxiety disorders.

    freedom is the move toward [intensive parenting](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-44156-1_2)
    that began in the 1980s. Parents, particularly mothers, have been encouraged to
    micro-manage their children’s lives, curate their experiences, remove any barriers,
    and enroll them in diverse structured activities with the intention of enhancing
    their development and giving them an edge in the race to succeed. This approach
    to parenting has become like the air we breathe—[widely accepted in North America](https://www.jstor.org/stable/26931463)—with
    parents of all backgrounds held to its unrealistic standard regardless of whether
    they can afford the necessary time, money, and energy.

    for children to play in. Yet statistics show that it has never been a safer time
    to be a child. Injury-related deaths are at an all-time low in most Western nations.
    In the US, [deaths from unintentional injuries fell](https://www.healthaffairs.org/doi/full/10.1377/hlthaff.2017.0767)

    spaces where they can use their imagination and explore risks, rather than spaces

    built to accommodate a growing number of cars. At a legislative level, we need
    to move away from municipal planning that prioritizes cars over people–an important
    step that a number of North American cities have already taken. Outside of legislation,
    there is much that individuals can do, even with the little space that is available.
    For example, “loose parts” (e.g., sticks, lumber, rocks, boxes, and tarps) can
    turn boring and barren play spaces into places of joy and wonder.While these may
    look like junk to adults, children love them. Scotland developed [a loose parts
