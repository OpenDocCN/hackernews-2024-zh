    among 11,201 respondents who are members of the Center’s American Trends Panel
    (ATP). The survey included interviews with a total of 3,317 religious “nones”

    sampling of residential addresses, which gives nearly all U.S. adults a chance
    of selection. The survey is weighted to be representative of the U.S. adult population
    by gender, race, ethnicity, political party, education, religious affiliation
    and other categories. For more, refer to the [ATP’s methodology](https://www.pewresearch.org/methods/u-s-survey-research/american-trends-panel/)

    by saying they are atheist, agnostic or “nothing in particular” are combined into
    a category called “religiously unaffiliated” – now widely known as the “nones.”

    at rates rivaling those seen among religiously affiliated adults. Those who describe

    alone) is the key differentiator between people who are most civically involved

    religious services at least once a month volunteer at much higher rates (41%)

    (17%) *and* “nones” (also 17%).
