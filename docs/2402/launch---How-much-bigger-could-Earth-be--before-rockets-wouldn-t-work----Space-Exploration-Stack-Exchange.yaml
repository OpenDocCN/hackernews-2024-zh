    for reaching a higher velocity for a minimal orbit would increase on your heavier
    Earth. (For constant density it is proportional to the radius.)

- en: How can we increase the $\Delta v$ of the rocket to keep up? We can increase
    the exhaust velocity, $v_e$, of the engine, but that cut-off is around 5000 m/s
    for chemical engines. The other thing we could do is increasing the mass ratio
    of the rocket $\left(\frac{m_0}{m_f}\right)$. That is problematic too, as we can
    not really make the fuel tanks out of soap bubbles. Staging is the option left,
    you could place a big rocket under a small rocket to get a little more change
    in velocity. Then you are getting a linear benefit for an exponential expense.

    towards the Moon (3120 m/s), the service module slowed the stack into LMO (820
    m/s), and finally the LM landed and took off again (2*1720 m/s). There are still
    some unused fuel left in the service module then, so let us just call the total
    $\Delta v$ of the Saturn V/Apollo 17 km/s. That is less than the requirements
    for a 2x radius Earth. The Apollo program was pretty expensive [citation needed],
    so it may take a while before a nation of a 2x Earth world attempts to go into
    orbit. The limit is, as you state, the ridiculously low payload ratio.

- en: Another consideration is the increased surface gravity. (That scales linearly
    with diameter at constant density). That requires the rocket to have a higher
    thrust to weight ratio, and that will increase the dry mass, reducing the possible
    $\Delta v$. (It also increases gravity losses, but that is mostly compensated
    by the lower scale height of the planet, reducing drag losses).

    lift itself from the ground. That at least is a definitive limit.

- en: 'Surprisingly, it is not. Remember what I said about staging earlier: "you are
    getting a linear benefit for an exponential expense". But there is not limit to
    what we can expend! Consider the following scenario: We add more and more stages
    at the bottom of the rocket, each of them has the same mass as all the stages
    on top of it. Then burning each of them gives the same mass ratio between before
    and after, therefore each of them are supplying the same amount of $\Delta v$.
    To add 10 times that amount, you need 10 stages each doubling the mass. To add
    100 times that amount, you need to double a hundred times. The mass grows ridiculously
    fast, even doubling 10 times are over a thousand times more. But why should we
    stop :)'

- en: 'After a while, other problems show up. For instance: Rockets are long and thin,
    to minimize drag. That shape can not be kept for very large rockets. The reason
    not is the [square cube law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square-cube_law). Conserving
    the same dimensional proportions, a rocket twice the height has 8 times more mass.
    But the base area of the rocket has only increased 4 times. That means that each
    unit of area has to support more mass. Sooner or later, even the strongest materials
    must give up, and you must give up the traditional rocket shape in favour of a
    wider base. That adds a lot to the drag! Problems like that are going to continue
    to show up:'

- en: A modern design, larger rocket than the Saturn V, with modifications to increase
    the T/W ratio could probably make it to orbit on a 2x radius, 8x mass Earth. That
    is a feasibility limit, rockets that are ridiculously much larger may have a few
    km/s extra $\Delta v$, but that does not alter the numbers a lot. In theory though,
    rockets can grow until the drag stops them, or the engines can no longer lift
    even themselves.
