    the source publication, KARE11, explained that the jammers simply confused wireless
    devices rather than blocking signals. They usually work by overloading wireless
    traffic “so that real traffic cannot get through,” the news site was told.

    2020\. It is also easy to find reports of burglars using Wi-Fi jamming technology
    over 2021, 2022, and 2023 – with reports becoming more frequent over time.

    in 2024\. KARE11 notes that it could buy jammers online very easily and cheaply,
    with prices ranging from $40 to $1,000\. Jammers are not legal to use in the U.S.
    but they are very easy to buy online.

    the efficacy of their home security systems with wireless components. Firstly,
    physically connect some of the devices which allow for a wired connection and
    local storage of footage. Secondly, utilize [smart home technology](https://www.tomshardware.com/news/samsung-ai-npus-bixby-appliances-2024)
    that makes it appear that someone is at home. Your device may also have the ability
    to send alerts when the signal / connection is interrupted, and playing with those
    settings might be worthwhile.
