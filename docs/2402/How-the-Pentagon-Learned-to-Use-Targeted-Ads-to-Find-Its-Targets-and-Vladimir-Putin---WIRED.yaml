- en: Most alarmingly, PlanetRisk began seeing evidence of the US military’s own missions
    in the Locomotive data. Phones would appear at American military installations
    such as Fort Bragg in North Carolina and MacDill Air Force Base in Tampa, Florida—home
    of some of the most skilled US special operators with the Joint Special Operations
    Command and other US Special Operations Command units. They would then transit
    through third-party countries like Turkey and Canada before eventually arriving
    in northern Syria, where they were clustering at the abandoned Lafarge cement
    factory outside the town of Kobane.

    at an unannounced military facility. Months later, their suspicions would be publicly
    confirmed; eventually the US government would acknowledge the facility was a forward
    operating base for personnel deployed in the anti-ISIS campaign.

    time. UberMedia’s data was usually updated every 24 hours or so. But sometimes,
    they saw movement that had occurred as recently as 15 or 30 minutes earlier. Here
    were some of the best-trained special operations units in the world, operating
    at an unannounced base. Yet their precise, shifting coordinates were showing up
    in UberMedia’s advertising data. While Locomotive was a closely held project meant
    for government use, UberMedia’s data was available for purchase by anyone who
    could come up with a plausible excuse. It wouldn’t be difficult for the Chinese
    or Russian government to get this kind of data by setting up a shell company with
    a cover story, just as Mike Yeagley had done.

- en: 'Initially, PlanetRisk was sampling data country by country, but it didn’t take
    long for the team to wonder what it would cost to buy the entire world. The sales
    rep at UberMedia provided the answer: For a few hundred thousand dollars a month,
    the company would provide a global feed of every phone on earth that the company
    could collect on. The economics were impressive. For the military and intelligence
    community, a few hundred thousand a month was essentially a rounding error—in
    2020, the intelligence budget was $62.7 billion. Here was a powerful intelligence
    tool for peanuts.'

- en: Locomotive, the first version of which was coded in 2016, blew away Pentagon
    brass. One government official demanded midway through the demo that the rest
    of it be conducted inside a SCIF, a secure government facility where classified
    information could be discussed. The official didn’t understand how or what PlanetRisk
    was doing but assumed it must be a secret. A PlanetRisk employee at the briefing
    was mystified. “We were like, well, this is just stuff we’ve seen commercially,”
    they recall. “We just licensed the data.” After all, how could marketing data
    be classified?

    asked to keep Locomotive quiet. It wouldn’t be classified, but the company would
    be asked to tightly control word of the capability to give the military time to
    take advantage of public ignorance of this kind of data and turn it into an operational
    surveillance program.

    official. They were on the elevator together when one official asked, could you
    figure out who is cheating on their spouse?

- en: As the company looked to turn Locomotive from a demo into a live product, Yeagley
    started to believe that his employer was taking the wrong approach. It was looking
    to build a data visualization platform for the government. Yet again, Yeagley
    thought it would be better to provide the raw data to the government and let them
    visualize it in any way they choose. Rather than make money off of the number
    of users inside government that buy a software license, Mike Yeagley wanted to
    just sell the government the data for a flat fee.
