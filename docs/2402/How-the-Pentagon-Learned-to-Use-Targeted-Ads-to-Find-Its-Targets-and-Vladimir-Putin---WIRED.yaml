- en: Most alarmingly, PlanetRisk began seeing evidence of the US military’s own missions
    in the Locomotive data. Phones would appear at American military installations
    such as Fort Bragg in North Carolina and MacDill Air Force Base in Tampa, Florida—home
    of some of the most skilled US special operators with the Joint Special Operations
    Command and other US Special Operations Command units. They would then transit
    through third-party countries like Turkey and Canada before eventually arriving
    in northern Syria, where they were clustering at the abandoned Lafarge cement
    factory outside the town of Kobane.

  zh: 最令人担忧的是，PlanetRisk 开始在铁路局的数据中见到了美国军方自己的任务证据。手机会出现在美国军事基地，比如北卡罗来纳州的布拉格堡和佛罗里达州坦帕的麦克迪尔空军基地
    —— 这里驻扎着美国特种作战联合指挥部和其他美国特种作战司令部单位的一些技艺高超的专家。然后它们会经过土耳其和加拿大等第三方国家，最终抵达叙利亚北部，在那里聚集在科班镇郊的废弃拉法基水泥厂。
- en: It dawned on the PlanetRisk team that these were US special operators converging
    at an unannounced military facility. Months later, their suspicions would be publicly
    confirmed; eventually the US government would acknowledge the facility was a forward
    operating base for personnel deployed in the anti-ISIS campaign.

  zh: PlanetRisk 团队意识到这些是美国特种部队聚集在一个未公布的军事设施。几个月后，他们的怀疑将被公开确认；最终，美国政府也会承认该设施是一所前沿作战基地，为部署在反ISIS战役中的人员。
- en: Even worse, through Locomotive, they were getting data in pretty close to real
    time. UberMedia’s data was usually updated every 24 hours or so. But sometimes,
    they saw movement that had occurred as recently as 15 or 30 minutes earlier. Here
    were some of the best-trained special operations units in the world, operating
    at an unannounced base. Yet their precise, shifting coordinates were showing up
    in UberMedia’s advertising data. While Locomotive was a closely held project meant
    for government use, UberMedia’s data was available for purchase by anyone who
    could come up with a plausible excuse. It wouldn’t be difficult for the Chinese
    or Russian government to get this kind of data by setting up a shell company with
    a cover story, just as Mike Yeagley had done.

  zh: 更糟糕的是，通过铁路局，他们几乎可以实时获取数据。UberMedia 的数据通常每 24 小时更新一次左右。但有时，他们看到的是发生在 15 或 30
    分钟前的运动。这里有一些世界上训练有素的特种作战部队，在一个未公布的基地进行操作。然而，它们精确而不断变化的坐标出现在 UberMedia 的广告数据中。虽然铁路局是一个专为政府使用而保密的项目，但
    UberMedia 的数据可以被任何能够编造一个合理借口的人购买。像中国或俄罗斯政府设立一个有合理掩护的壳公司来获取这种数据并不难，就像迈克·伊格利（Mike
    Yeagley）一样。
- en: 'Initially, PlanetRisk was sampling data country by country, but it didn’t take
    long for the team to wonder what it would cost to buy the entire world. The sales
    rep at UberMedia provided the answer: For a few hundred thousand dollars a month,
    the company would provide a global feed of every phone on earth that the company
    could collect on. The economics were impressive. For the military and intelligence
    community, a few hundred thousand a month was essentially a rounding error—in
    2020, the intelligence budget was $62.7 billion. Here was a powerful intelligence
    tool for peanuts.'

  zh: 起初，PlanetRisk 团队是逐国抽样收集数据，但他们很快就想知道购买全球数据需要多少费用。UberMedia 的销售代表给出了答案：每个月花费几十万美元，该公司将提供全球范围内它所能收集到的每部手机的数据。这一经济学是令人印象深刻的。对于军事和情报界来说，几十万美元就是基本上一个舍入误差——在
    2020 年，情报预算是 627 亿美元。这是一个强大的情报工具，只需要少得可怜的费用。
- en: Locomotive, the first version of which was coded in 2016, blew away Pentagon
    brass. One government official demanded midway through the demo that the rest
    of it be conducted inside a SCIF, a secure government facility where classified
    information could be discussed. The official didn’t understand how or what PlanetRisk
    was doing but assumed it must be a secret. A PlanetRisk employee at the briefing
    was mystified. “We were like, well, this is just stuff we’ve seen commercially,”
    they recall. “We just licensed the data.” After all, how could marketing data
    be classified?

  zh: 第一个版本编码于2016年的《Locomotive》震惊了五角大楼的高级官员。一名政府官员在演示进行到中途时要求其余部分在SCIF内进行，这是一个安全的政府设施，可以讨论机密信息。这名官员不明白PlanetRisk在做什么，但假设这必定是个秘密。一位PlanetRisk的员工在简报会上感到困惑。“我们就像，这些都是我们商业上见过的东西，”他们回忆道。“我们只是获得了数据的许可。”毕竟，市场营销数据怎么可能是机密？
- en: Government officials were so enthralled by the capability that PlanetRisk was
    asked to keep Locomotive quiet. It wouldn’t be classified, but the company would
    be asked to tightly control word of the capability to give the military time to
    take advantage of public ignorance of this kind of data and turn it into an operational
    surveillance program.

  zh: 政府官员对PlanetRisk的能力如此着迷，以至于要求保密《Locomotive》。这不会成为机密，但公司将被要求严格控制有关这种能力的消息，以便军方有时间利用公众对这种数据的无知，并将其转化为操作性监视项目。

- en: As the company looked to turn Locomotive from a demo into a live product, Yeagley
    started to believe that his employer was taking the wrong approach. It was looking
    to build a data visualization platform for the government. Yet again, Yeagley
    thought it would be better to provide the raw data to the government and let them
    visualize it in any way they choose. Rather than make money off of the number
    of users inside government that buy a software license, Mike Yeagley wanted to
    just sell the government the data for a flat fee.

  zh: 当公司希望将《Locomotive》从演示版转变为实际产品时，Yeagley开始认为他的雇主正在采取错误的方法。它希望为政府建立一个数据可视化平台。然而，Yeagley再次认为，最好是将原始数据提供给政府，让他们以任何方式进行可视化。与其通过政府内购买软件许可证的用户数量赚钱，Mike
    Yeagley更希望只以一笔固定费用向政府出售数据。
