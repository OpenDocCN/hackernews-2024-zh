    parting thoughts and confirm. Go outside and touch grass, as the kids say. The
    best social network has always been your contacts app.

    API changes and behavior towards them after said changes. Next up, it's going
    to make money by selling exclusive access to all the nonsense, advice and time
    you've invested into **their** platform so that an extractive AI model can be
    trained on it. I'm sure there'll be more ads too.

    platform will only, inexorably get worse for everyone logging into it.
