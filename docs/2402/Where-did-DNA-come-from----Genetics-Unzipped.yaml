    life, there are no trees, plants, or animals. There’s also no oxygen or ozone
    layer, leaving the planet’s surface exposed to the sun’s intense UV rays and making
    it blisteringly hot. Despite the high temperatures, there are [vast oceans covering
    most of the surface of the Earth](https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2021/04/harvard-scientists-determine-early-earth-may-have-been-a-water-world/).
    Frequent volcanic eruptions spew gases into the atmosphere, including carbon dioxide,
    nitrogen, hydrogen and water vapour. Not a great place to be, by any standards.

    capable of self-replicating. As a geneticist, your mind might jump straight away
    to the most famous self-replicating molecule of them all, DNA. However, there
    has been plenty of debate about exactly which biological molecule filled this
    role, with many pointing to RNA as the prime candidate for the first replicator
    thanks to its versatility that allows it to self-replicate and store information
    - this is the basis of the so-called RNA world hypothesis.

- en: RNA is a single-stranded biological polymer made up of building blocks called
    nucleotides. Nucleotides consist of a ribose sugar molecule attached to a phosphate
    group and a nitrogen-containing base. The bases in RNA are adenine, cytosine,
    guanine and uracil, usually known by their initials, A, C, G and U, strung together
    along a phosphate sugar backbone. And it’s the order of these nucleotides, or
    letters, that spell out the genetic code.

- en: Scientists think that individual nucleotides may have formed spontaneously in
    the chaotic soup that was simmering on the primordial earth, and eventually, these
    nucleotides bonded together to form RNA. Unstable RNAs quickly broke down, but
    stable molecules grew and finally, self-copying RNA formed. Some RNAs were better
    at copying themselves than others, so they persisted and became more abundant
    - natural selection at its most fundamental.

    Urey from the University of Chicago devised experiments to try to prove that organic
    building blocks necessary for life could form spontaneously under the conditions
    seen on the early earth. They built a closed system containing gases thought to
    be present back in the day - ammonia, nitrogen, hydrogen - and a heated pool of
    water. Next, they sent sparks of electricity through the system to represent lighting
    flashes that might have provided energy to kickstart chemical reactions on the
    primordial planet.

    experiment showed that organic building blocks could have formed spontaneously
    on early earth, laying the foundation for more complex molecules later on. Experts
    now think that Miller and Urey’s experiments didn’t get the atmosphere of early
    Earth quite right, but more recent experiments have shown that [organic building
    blocks, including nucleotides](https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg21528795-500-dna-could-have-existed-long-before-life-itself/),
    can form under a relatively wide range of conditions that [could have been present

    but the details on how they came together to form more complex molecules remain
    sketchy.

- en: While the theory about the origins of single-stranded RNA seems relatively straightforward
    - nucleotides formed, they somehow glued themselves together and made copies of
    themselves - most of life on earth uses double-stranded DNA, not RNA, as its genetic
    code.

    in DNA contain a different sugar - deoxyribose, which is harder to make than the
    ribose sugar in RNA. What’s more, in DNA, uracil is replaced with the base thymine,
    or T, which has a slightly different structure. Hence the DNA genetic code is
    spelled out in the letters A, C, G and T.

- en: Exactly how DNA came into existence is still a mystery. Conventional wisdom
    suggests that RNA-based life eventually switched to DNA to take advantage of its
    stability, which makes it better at storing genetic information. But so far, there
    is little evidence about how this could have happened.

- en: There are viruses whose genomes contain DNA with uracil instead of thymine,
    a substance called uracil-DNA. The existence of this half-way house might give
    us a glimpse into the evolution of DNA from RNA, but many questions remain about
    the switch, including how early life forms could have translated RNA into DNA,
    a process that relies on enzymes that scientists think required millions more
    years of evolution.

- en: Mysteries like these mean that in recent years, increasing numbers of experts
    have renounced the RNA world hypothesis and, with it, the idea that DNA evolved
    from RNA. Instead, some have put forward the theory that RNA and DNA formed at
    around the same time. Recent experiments at Ludwig Maximilians University in Munich,
    Germany, have shown that the [subunits of DNA could have formed spontaneously](https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/516640)
    and been present in the primordial soup, suggesting that the first DNA molecules
    could have formed at a similar time to RNA.

- en: Others suggest that the idea that pure RNA or pure DNA formed spontaneously
    is unlikely. This is because single strands of RNA or DNA match up with complementary
    nucleotide building blocks as a first step to copying themselves. But the paired
    RNA or DNA strands then bind together so tightly that they can’t separate without
    help from sophisticated enzymes, preventing them from making any new RNA or DNA.

    that any nucleic acid formed before proteins](https://www.quantamagazine.org/lifes-first-molecule-was-protein-not-rna-new-model-suggests-20171102/),
    instead favouring a metabolism-first hypothesis with amino acids appearing spontaneously
    in the primordial soup and eventually forming peptides, self-replicating proteins
    and ultimately self-sustaining metabolic networks, with nucleic acids turning

    that life got started thanks to [charged proton particles shuttling around](https://nick-lane.net/publications/proton-gradients-origin-life/)

    including alternative nucleic acids and even genetic material or life itself arriving
    on earth from outer space. Although this would render all this speculation about
    chemical conditions on early Earth completely irrelevant, it merely shifts the
    problem to a different place in the universe.

    into proteins that allow organisms to function, is near enough uniform in every
    living organism, with the same three-letter ‘words’ or codons translating to the
    same amino acids in almost every known organism, with only rare and very weird
    exceptions.

    that it must have evolved before the theoretical last universal common ancestor
    (LUCA) from which all life supposedly descended appeared around 3.5-3.8 billion
    years ago, allowing it to be passed on and preserved throughout the entire tree
    of life.

    version with fewer amino acids, with some suggestions that the first ‘code’ only
    used two amino acids, which then expanded to become the full repertoire we know
    and love today. But there is no scientific consensus about how the initial code
    evolved, what it was like, or how it functioned.
