    said that if you’ve never really spoken another language, then the best strategy
    is to start with the easiest possible language to learn, which is [Esperanto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esperanto).
    His advice is to spend just a few weeks learning and having conversations in Esperanto,
    so that you can feel the experience of detaching from your mother tongue. Then
    you’ll be better-prepared to go learn the language you really want to learn.

    and I actually had spare time, I procrastinated something by thinking, “I should
    look into Esperanto.” I sat down mid-afternoon and checked out [lernu.net](https://lernu.net/),
    which seemed to be the most popular Esperanto-learning site. And oh my god! It’s
    fascinating! The language is so well designed! Everything made sense and with
    each new thing I learned, I thought “That’s brilliant!”, and wanted to learn more.
    I was so riveted that I didn’t realize it had gotten dark, and by the time I got
    out of that chair it was 10pm.

    and there was an annual Esperanto conference in Seoul Korea in July, so I signed
    up to attend the conference and made that my deadline for fluency. I found an
    [Esperanto teacher](https://www.frenchfluency.net/), signed up for live conversation
    practice, and started learning for one to three hours a day. I was a keen and
    diligent student, and had Esperanto books shipped from overseas, which I read
    slowly, learning new vocabulary. I watched [videos in Esperanto](https://www.youtube.com/@Evildea)
    made by a funny Australian dude. I used [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) flashcards,
    and wrote my own command-line dictionary for quick reference of every word I’d
    learned. I was so into it that my friend [Elina](https://www.storyo.co.nz/about)
    got annoyed and asked if I could please stop talking about it so much.

    a few days in Singapore. There’s an [app](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amikumu)
    (made by the funny Australian dude) that helps you find other Esperanto speakers
    in your area that are willing to meet up and talk in Esperanto. So I turned it
    on in Singapore. It said that just a mile away from me was an Esperanto speaker
    named Sonja Lang. Wait a minute… I know that name… Oh my god it’s her!

- en: Sonja Lang, a brilliant linguist and translator, was inspired by Taoist philosophy,
    and found she felt best when she simplfied her thoughts and concentrated on basic
    things. So she decided to apply the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis and created a new language
    that has only 137 words. With so few words to communicate everything, you have
    to simplify your thoughts and concentrate on the basic essence. She called it
    [Toki Pona](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toki_Pona). I had heard of it for years,
    found the idea fascinating, and even read a little book about it.

    up with me. She said yes, but only if we speak only Esperanto. We met up the next
    day at a restaurant in Singapore. She’s like a rock star to me, so I was nervous
    and excited, and I’d sometimes break into English to tell her something. But she
    patiently responded in Esperanto, and spoke only Esperanto for two hours with
    me that evening.

    of the attendees around me was probably 55. They were disheveled and unkempt.
    They had signs saying we could have world peace if everyone spoke Esperanto. They
    were singing sappy songs with acoustic guitars and hand-drums about Zamenhof,
    the linguist who invented Esperanto in 1888. I cringed. It’s hippie Klingon.

    of course), after watching so many hours of his videos, that was cool to meet
    him. But everyone else? Eh. I realized I had no desire to talk with these people.
    And then I felt bad for my lack of interest. I’ve attended many conferences about
    the Ruby programming language, and really loved nerding out on those conversations
    with fellow enthusiasts. But I just didn’t like these Esperanto people. I felt
    like a bad person for not being more interested in them. So I forced myself to
    have a few more Esperanto conversations with strangers, but I still didn’t like
    it. And so I left and never spoke Esperanto again.

    all the way in. So I’m left with a feeling of regret.

    and deeply felt that regret.

    world’s shared second language, then it would be Swahili or colloquial Indonesian.
    He said both of these languages have been learned by millions of people as their
    second language, so all the weird edge-cases have worn away, and they are as smooth
    and beautiful as a river stone. No weird grammar. No weird tones. No exceptions.
    In all of his studies of hundreds of languages, he said Indonesian is the closest
    thing to an ideal language he has ever encountered.

    place of the language) to speak nothing but Swahili for a week. Or learned this
    ideal language of colloquial Indonesian, and instead of going to a hippie nerd
    conference I would have talked with people around the Indonesian islands. These
    scenarios are much more inspiring to bridge the communication gap.
