    a bot watch 1,000 hours” of just about anything. The premise (concocted by comedian
    Keaton Patti) was that you could train an artificial intelligence model on vast
    quantities of *Saw* films, Hallmark specials, or Olive Garden commercials and
    get back a bizarre funhouse-mirror version with lines like “lasagna wings with
    extra Italy” or “her mouth is full of secret soup.” The scripts almost certainly
    weren’tactually written by a bot, but the joke conveyed a common cultural understanding:
    AI was *weird*.'

  zh: 在2018年，一个病毒式的笑话开始在互联网上传播：基于“让一个机器人观看1000小时”的脚本。这个由喜剧演员基顿·帕蒂设计的前提是，你可以让人工智能模型在大量观看*Saw*电影、Hallmark特辑或橄榄园广告后生成一个带有“意大利式千层面翅”或“她的嘴里装满了秘密汤”的荒诞变形版本。这些脚本几乎肯定不是真正由机器人编写的，但这个笑话传达了一种普遍的文化理解：AI是*奇怪*的。
- en: Strange AI was everywhere a few years ago. *AI Dungeon*, a text adventure game
    genuinely powered by OpenAI’s GPT-2 and GPT-3, touted its ability to produce deeply
    imagined stories about the inner life of a chair. The first well-known AI art
    tools, like Google’s [computer vision program Deep Dream](/2015/8/5/9104121/dreamify-app-google-deep-dream-ios-android),
    produced unabashedly bizarre [Giger-esque nightmares](/2016/10/24/13379208/ai-nsfw-neural-nets-deep-dream-genitals).
    Perhaps the archetypal example was Janelle Shane’s blog *AI Weirdness*, where
    Shane trained models to create physically impossible nuclear waste warnings or
    sublimely inedible recipes. “Made by a bot” was shorthand for a kind of free-associative,
    nonsensical surrealism — both because of the models’ technical limitations and
    because they were more curiosities than commercial products. Lots of people had
    *seen* what “a bot” (actually or supposedly) produced. Fewer had used one. Even
    fewer had to worry about them in day-to-day life.

    an AI,” suggested Caroline Mimbs Nyce in *The Atlantic* last May. Nyce charted
    the rise of “AI” as a term of derision — referring to material that was “dull
    or uninspired, riddled with clich​​és and recycled ideas.” The insult would reach

- en: Part of the shift stems from AI tools getting dramatically better. The surrealism
    of early generative work was partially a byproduct of its deep limitations. Early
    text models, for instance, had limited memory that made it tough to maintain narrative
    or even grammatical continuity. That produced the trademark dream logic of systems
    like early *AI Dungeon*, where stories drifted between settings, genres, and protagonists
    over the span of sentences.

    short film *Sunspring*](https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/05/an-ai-wrote-this-movie-and-its-strangely-moving/),
    for instance, the bot they trained to make it couldn’t even “learn” the patterns
    behind proper names — resulting in characters dubbed H, H2, and C. Its dialogue
    is technically correct but almost Borgesian in its oddity. “You should see the
    boys and shut up,” H2 snaps during the film’s opening scene, in which no boys
    have been mentioned. “I was the one who was going to be a hundred years old.”
    Less than a decade later, a program like Sudowrite (built on OpenAI’s GPT-3.5
    and GPT-4 models) can spit out paragraphs of text that closely imitates cliched
    genre prose.

    weird AI. The AI Weirdness hack has proven surprisingly adept at getting AI tools

    AI models are hitting the uncanny valley between “so bad it’s good” and “good

    adept at remixing information in a way that feels fresh and unexpected. Maybe
    the schism between artists and AI developers will resolve, and we’ll see more
    tools that amplify human idiosyncrasy instead of offering a lowest-common-denominator
    replacement for it. At the very least, it’s still possible to guide AI tools into
    clever juxtaposition — like a biblical verse about [removing a sandwich from a
