- en: The figure above details the many stages of the software supply chain for an
    open source dependency. Enterprises have widely different entry points to this
    lifecycle - some organizations may build packages from source themselves, while
    others pull packages from repos that they trust.

- en: A few organizations including Google centralize control and actively secure
    each step of the end-to-end process. In our case, we start by maintaining separate
    secured copies of the source code for our dependencies and perform our own vulnerability
    scanning. We continuously fuzz [550 of the most commonly-used open source projects](https://github.com/google/oss-fuzz),
    and as of January 2022 have found [more than 36,000 vulnerabilities](https://github.com/google/oss-fuzz).
    This makes us one of the largest contributors to the OSV.

    integrated integrity, provenance, and security checks. Based on our internal security
    practices, we have created the [SLSA framework](https://slsa.dev/) to enable organizations
    to assess the maturity of their software supply chain security and understand
    key steps to progress to the next level.

    to construct and operate such a comprehensive program. Instead, their development
    teams might individually decide where they get third-party source code and packages,
    how they are built, and how to redistribute them within their own organizations
    according to their goals, threat and risk model, and resources. However, the lack
    of an end-to-end process creates risk exposure [each step of the way](https://security.googleblog.com/2021/08/updates-on-our-continued-collaboration.html).

    end-to-end security capabilities and practices we apply to our own OSS portfolio
    by providing access to the same OSS packages that Google depends on. Users will
    also be able to submit packages from their own OSS portfolio to be secured and
    managed through the Google Cloud managed service.
