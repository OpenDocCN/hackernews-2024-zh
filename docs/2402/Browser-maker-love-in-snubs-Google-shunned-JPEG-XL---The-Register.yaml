    consultancies, celebrated a moment of unity and common purpose on Thursday with
    the announcement of Interop 2024, a project to promote web browser interoperability.

    for web technologies that group members will try to harmonize using automated
    tests. The goal is to ensure browser implementations of these technologies match
    specifications in order to make the web platform better for developers.
