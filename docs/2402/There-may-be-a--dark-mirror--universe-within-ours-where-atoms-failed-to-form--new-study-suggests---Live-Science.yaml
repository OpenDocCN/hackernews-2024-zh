    set of rules? That might explain why dark matter appears to be so abundant yet
    invisible, a new theory suggests.

- en: '[Dark matter](https://www.livescience.com/dark-matter.html) is the mysterious,
    unknown substance that seems to make up the bulk of all the mass in the universe;
    for every 2 pounds (1 kilogram) of regular matter, there''s roughly 10 pounds
    (5 kg) of dark matter. It doesn''t interact with light or normal matter. The only
    way scientists can detect it is through its subtle gravitational influence on
    normal matter, such as the motions of stars within galaxies and the [growth of
    super-large structures](https://www.livescience.com/space/cosmology/james-webb-telescope-detects-the-earliest-strand-in-the-cosmic-web-ever-seen)

    rules, one would be totally dominant over the other. But despite having wildly
    different properties, the amounts of normal matter and dark matter are still in
    the same ballpark. That seems like a strange coincidence.  To explain this, scientists
    proposed there could be some sort of hidden link between them. They published
    their research [Jan. 22 on the preprint journal arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12286).

    there's a mirror of it in the world of dark matter. This would be a new kind of
    symmetry in nature, connecting the normal and dark matter worlds, the researchers
    said.

    the same abundances.

- en: In the paper, the researchers point out another strange coincidence. In the
    physics of normal matter, a neutron and proton have almost exactly the same mass,
    which enables them to bind together and form stable atoms. If a proton was just
    a little bit heavier, it would be totally unstable and decay in only a few minutes,
    making the formation of atoms impossible. In this imaginary scenario, the universe
    would be left with a sea of free-floating neutrons.

- en: Perhaps, the researchers suggest, this imaginary, broken cosmos may be a reality
    in the dark matter mirror version of our universe. A special combination of physics
    led to a proton having roughly the same mass as a neutron; perhaps in the dark
    matter mirror, that combination of physics played out differently, causing the
    "dark proton" to evaporate and leave behind a sea of "dark neutrons" — what we
    identify as dark matter.

- en: While this proposed mirror model allows for the possibility of rich interactions
    among dark matter particles — dark atoms, dark chemistry and a [dark periodic
    table of dark elements](https://www.livescience.com/space/cosmology/dark-matter-may-have-its-own-invisible-periodic-table-of-elements)
    — there can't be too much interaction, the researchers noted. If the dark matter
    interacts with itself a lot, it would tend to clump up far more than scientists
    think it does. So most of the dark matter has to be relatively simple — a sea
    of free-floating, neutral particles.

    world, may enable future scientists to test this theory. In the early universe,
    normal matter underwent nucleosynthesis, when the first elements formed in a nuclear
    plasma. If this new idea is correct, then there was a mirror nucleosynthesis also
    happening in dark matter. In those chaotic early days, channels may have opened
    up between the two worlds, enabling them to affect each other.

    generation of cosmological observatories hope to do — scientists may be able to
    find evidence for one of these channels and get a glimpse into the mirror dark
    universe.
