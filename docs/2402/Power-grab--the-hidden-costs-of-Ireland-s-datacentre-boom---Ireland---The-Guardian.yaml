    see a datacentre. Over the past two decades, datacentres have become a common
    sight on the outskirts of Dublin and many other Irish cities and towns. Situated
    in industrial business parks, they are easy to miss. But these buildings are critical
    to the maintenance of contemporary life: inside their walls stand rows and rows
    of networked servers; inside the servers, terabytes of data flow.'

    datacentre, situated in a business park behind Northside shopping centre. Although
    we live close by, we haven’t driven this way before, and our route takes us through
    a number of the local authority estates that my husband lived in as a boy. These
    estates are set on either side of a long, straight road pocked with chicanes to
    deter joyriders. Even though the housing development sprawls for miles on either
    side – with large wind-blasted green spaces in between – the houses huddle, squashed
    together. It looks as if someone has transplanted a warren of inner-city Victorian
    terraces to this desolate terrain.

    banking scandal, which exposed the country’s citizens to massive debt, Ireland enjoyed
    a period of rapid economic growth. Even as it struggled to exit recession in the
    2010s, Ireland’s continued policy of low corporate taxation encouraged the growth
    of big tech in the country. The result is that Ireland’s economy is heavily dependent
    on tech companies, with low corporate taxes meaning that these companies contribute
    little to the Irish exchequer – and, by extension, to the Irish citizen left heavily
    indebted by the recession.

    wander alongside the fence for a bit. Apart from a few cars parked in the car
    park, there is nothing to look at; it feels like the building itself is looking
    away. As with my daughter’s initial sketch, it’s difficult to identify the building’s
    front, although some panels of dark glass and a central door give a subtle hint
    toward ingress. The windowless grey facade is broken up by a number of grids,
    which look like part of the building’s cooling system. Ireland’s climate has been
    a major factor in attracting datacentres to the country – servers need to be kept
    cool, and Ireland’s temperate climate makes this easier. A 2023 [Irish Times article](https://www.irishtimes.com/business/2023/11/03/you-need-to-offset-some-of-your-capacity-and-we-can-take-it-iceland-pitches-itself-as-solution-to-irish-data-centre-dilemma/#:~:text=In%20March%20of%20this%20year,Iceland%20and%20Renmore%20in%20Galway.)
    notes that Iceland, too, is now trying to attract datacentre investment – the
    new 1,000-mile [Iris cable](https://www.submarinenetworks.com/en/systems/intra-europe/iris),
    which runs along the seabed between Ireland and Iceland to create a direct cable
    link between the two countries, could make this plan more viable. Paired with
    Iceland’s cold climate, low population density and commitment to sustainability
    – all but 15% of Iceland’s energy consumption is sourced from renewables – this
    means that Ireland could offload some of its data processing to Iceland to help
    offset the catastrophic impact of datacentres on Ireland’s energy consumption.
    According to Ireland’s Environmental Protection Agency, Ireland will miss its
    2030 carbon reduction targets by “[a significant margin](https://www.epa.ie/news-releases/news-releases-2023/ireland-projected-to-fall-well-short-of-climate-targets-says-epa.php)”.

    during the 1980s, a time when Ireland suffered successive recessions, mass emigration
    and a heroin plague. The estates seem to have changed little since those days,
    even though the country as a whole has seen massive economic and social shifts,
    and I start thinking about the fragility of social and national memory. I wonder
    if datacentres such as the one in Clonshaugh will contribute to the kind of record-keeping
    Ireland has not always excelled at as a nation. Ireland is a country with a long
    memory, but a patchy one. We’ve just completed our celebrations of the [Decade

    In the early 1920s, further violence erupted with the war of independence and
    then the civil war; the latter was a bitter internecine conflict that shifted
    the politics of Ireland away from the revolutionary ideals of the Easter Rising
    and toward the conservative Christian values that defined its 20th century. One
    of the conflict’s pivotal moments occurred on 30 June 1922, when the Public Record
    Office, a repository of more than 700 years of local records, was burned during
    a battle between the Irish Republican Army, which had rejected the terms of the
    1921 Anglo-Irish treaty that brought the Irish Free State into being, and the
    Free State government. “It was an act of cultural vandalism,” said Catriona Crowe,
    the former head of special projects at the National Archives of Ireland. “For
    a long time people didn’t realise what we had lost.”

    of knowledge preservation is stone, and the oldest,” Crowe said. “After that,
    parchment – it survives all kinds of difficulties and remains robust. Then we
    had rag-based paper, from the 15th century onward, and after that acid paper cut
    from forests in the early 19th century. This deteriorates very quickly and needs
    to be kept stable. But by far the most unstable form is digital. We have a black
    hole opening in history. When Irish government departments started using computers
    in the 1970s, there was no network, and many of those files can’t be read any
    longer. There’s no real policy for digital preservation of state records. A nightmare
    is facing us. Emails, Excel, Word, PowerPoint – they’ll all vanish – unless there’s
    a decision made by the government.”

    if the software used to read them becomes obsolete. And so all that material floating
    around in the cloud – which is in reality being bounced from server to server,
    degrading each time this happens – is not really being preserved in the way we
    might imagine. Its continued existence is dependent on a steady flow of electricity,
    the continued provision of which is contingent upon governments reaching renewables
    targets they can’t agree upon. And even then, these files will degrade, deteriorate
    and become obsolete. Rather than creating something permanent and inviolable,
    we’ve made our memories more contingent than ever upon a fantasy of technological
    stability that, given the constant churn of history, seems inevitably fleeting.

    climate is temperate. There, they consume vast amounts of energy, increasing carbon
    emissions. It’s a frightening and seemingly unsustainable pattern; we’ve entrusted
    our memories to a system that might destroy them, and us. Because of this fraught
    reality, datacentres in Ireland have become controversial in the past five years,
    and the tone of the newspaper articles discussing them has changed. It’s suggested
    that if all the datacentres currently proposed in Ireland are built, they could
    be using up to [70% of the country’s electricity](https://www.irishtimes.com/news/politics/data-centres-could-use-70-of-ireland-s-electricity-by-2030-committee-to-hear-1.4685589)

    environmentalists in the intervening years, with close scrutiny being paid to
    developers’ commitments to contributing to Ireland’s renewable power grid. The
    journalist Aoife Barry, in her research for her recent book Social Capital, has
    identified the ways in which multinationals are greenwashing their contribution
    toward renewables, including the case of a high court review of a planned Apple
    datacentre in County Galway in 2018:'

    clarity around ‘direct sustainable energy sources’, including how Apple would
    live up to its promise of running on 100% renewable energy. When Apple submitted
    a revised environmental impact assessment to the council, [it indicated](https://www.casemine.com/judgement/uk/5da05f764653d07dedfd6a47)
    that it wouldn’t be generating renewable energy itself. Instead, it would buy
    renewable generated power from an energy supplier ‘equal to the total power consumption
    of the datacentre building in any particular year’.”

    coming years, meaning any renewable investment is going to continue to lag behind
    the needs of the expanding datacentre sector.

    implemented measures aimed at streamlining the planning process for datacentres,
    which would allow concerned citizens less visibility into the estimated environmental
    impacts of these centres. Decreasing transparency in this instance seems unnerving,
    and symptomatic of the Irish state’s strange relationship with multinationals.
    In 2016, the Irish government rejected the European Commission’s ruling that [Apple
    should pay Ireland €13bn](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/30/apple-pay-back-taxes-eu-ruling-ireland-state-aid)
    in unpaid taxes, arguing that the lower corporate taxation rate the country offered
    at the time makes Ireland more attractive for investors. The logic behind that
    decision might have been confusing to everyday Irish citizens, given that at that
    time they were each saddled with [€42,000 in debt](https://assets.gov.ie/4274/111218115438-102376301fd948c2b20e3449111eff54.pdf)

    but provide only about [16,000 jobs](https://www.irishtimes.com/business/2023/09/21/qa-how-sustainable-is-ireland-as-a-data-centre-hub/)
    to a country of 5.28 million people. The lack of employment these centres provide
    leads to questions over who benefits from their existence. In August 2022, after
    two consecutive amber alerts for electricity outages in Ireland, then-finance
    minister Paschal Donohoe appeared on national broadcaster RTÉ’s radio show Morning
    Ireland, where he was quizzed about the low employment figures at datacentres
    and the fact that their profit margins were soaring while electricity bills had
    reached new highs for Irish citizens. He dismissed the lack of employment, emphasising
    instead the “huge importance of them to really large employers within our country,
    whose taxes and jobs are playing an invaluable part in our economic performance
    at the moment”.

    to concerns about pressure on the National Grid and the potential for rolling
    blackouts, EirGrid, Ireland’s energy grid, placed a [moratorium on the development](https://www.rte.ie/news/dublin/2022/0110/1272869-eirgrid-datacentres-dublin/)
    of new datacentres in Dublin until 2028\. But applications for centres outside
    the capital are still being granted. Other European countries, such as the Netherlands,
    are halting their development of datacentres. Singapore imposed a [three-year
    moratorium](https://www.lightreading.com/ai-machine-learning/singapore-ends-data-center-pause-as-it-seeks-sustainable-growth)
    from 2019 to 2022, and is now seeking applications within new parameters to ensure
    sustainability. Unless Ireland figures out a way to surge forward with its slow
    development of renewables, these datacentres seem impossible to sustain. One potential
    solution is to look more carefully at what data we retain, and why. We must weigh
    the short-term financial benefits of seemingly infinite data retention against
    the long-term threat of climate crisis.

    are always contingent upon the power structures and hierarchies that shape our

    entrusted the church with our moral guidance and guardianship, and then allowed
    it to commit unspeakable cruelties on our citizens, including the abuses recounted

    moved away from our old bad memories and toward a prosperous new era, placing
    our faith in international investment, almost at any cost. But in a small country
    like Ireland, the old names – whether they be companies or state organisations
    or political dynasties – crop up again and again. Sometimes our faulty memories
    flash up a warning. But often that history is stored in the cloud: intangible,
    vulnerable to exploitation – and degrading over time.'
