    only 100 [light-years](https://www.space.com/light-year.html) away from us. Its
    six sub-Neptune planets circle very close to their host star in mathematically
    perfect orbits, piquing the interest of scientists searching for alien technology,
    or technosignatures, which they argue would offer compelling evidence of advanced
    life beyond [Earth](https://www.space.com/54-earth-history-composition-and-atmosphere.html).

    the researchers say they're not done looking yet. HD 11067 remains an interesting
    target for similar observations in the future.

    meaning that if somebody outside our solar system watched Earth cross the face
    of our sun, they'd maybe be able to pick up a signal that coincides with the planet's
    transit.

    the plane of their system — a view that gives us an excellent chance of picking
    up such a signal if there exists one, study co-author Steve Croft, a radio astronomer
    working with the life-searching Breakthrough Listen program at the University
    of California, Berkeley, told Space.com

- en: '"Our technology in our own solar system has spread outside the [habitable zone](https://www.space.com/goldilocks-zone-habitable-area-life),"
    Croft told Space.com. So technology-friendly civilization in HD 110067, if any,
    may have communication relays set up on multiple planets in the system, he said.
    "Even if it is a negative result, that still tells us something."'

    largest fully steerable telescope, the Green Bank Telescope ([GBT](https://www.space.com/green-bank-observatory.html))
    in West Virginia, and searched the system for signs of alien technology. The researchers
    looked for signals that were continuously present when the telescope was pointed
    at the system and absent when directed away, the smoking gun of technosignatures
    local to HD 110067.

    waves and humankind's own technological signals, such as radio waves beaming from
    cell phones connected to Wi-Fi, [SpaceX](https://www.space.com/18853-spacex.html)'s
    [Starlink](https://www.space.com/spacex-starlink-satellites.html) satellite network
    in [low Earth orbit](https://www.space.com/low-earth-orbit). This creates a haystack
    of signals in which researchers look for a needle of a potential extraterrestrial
    signal, said Croft.

    the team employed a few techniques to ensure a detected signal is not local interference.
    For instance, if one were to build a transmitter in the hopes that somebody else
    would pick it up, that transmitter would pump a lot of energy into a narrow range
    of frequencies. Natural astrophysical phenomena, by contrast, beam radio waves
    across a much broader range.

    star would drift in time when observed from Earth, "the same as when an ambulance
    goes past you, the sound of it shifts from very high to very low," study lead
    author [Carmen Choza](https://www.linkedin.com/in/carmen-choza-28437422b/), an
    assistant researcher at the [Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence](https://www.space.com/33626-search-for-extraterrestrial-intelligence.html)
    (SETI) Institute in California, told Space.com.

    do not eliminate the existence of technosignatures in HD 110067, Croft said, but
    rather tell us that no signal was beamed in our direction at the time of the observations.
