    Mike Wilson](https://fortune.com/2023/02/20/wall-street-morgan-stanley-mike-wilson-warning-over-stock-price-rally/#).
    In February last year the chief investment officer warned the S&P 500 is in the
    “death zone,” a term mountaineers use to refer to altitudes where oxygen is no
    longer sufficient to sustain human life for an extended period of time.

    to dizzying heights once again as liquidity (bottled oxygen) allows them to climb
    into a region where they know they shouldn’t go and cannot live very long,” Wilson
    wrote, according to [MarketWatch](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/investors-have-pushed-stocks-into-the-death-zone-warns-morgan-stanleys-mike-wilson-dcef3c63?mod=home-page).
    “They climb in pursuit of the ultimate topping out of greed, assuming they will
    be able to ascend without catastrophic consequences. But the oxygen eventually
    runs out, and those who ignore the risks get hurt.”
