- en: The cryptocurrency exchange Gemini has [promised to return $1.1 billion](https://www.dfs.ny.gov/reports_and_publications/press_releases/pr202402282)
    to customers as part of [a settlement it reached](https://www.dfs.ny.gov/system/files/documents/2024/02/ea20240228_co_geminitrustcompanyllc.pdf)
    with New York’s Department of Financial Services (NYDFS). Gemini will also have
    to pay $37 million to the NYDFS “for significant failures that threatened the
    safety and soundness of the company.”

- en: The NYDFS claims Gemini, which is owned by twins Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss,
    had “compliance, management, and internal audit issues” when it came to managing
    its Earn program. Introduced in 2021, Gemini’s Earn program let customers loan
    their cryptocurrency to the crypto brokerage Genesis Global Capital while receiving
    interest.

    by Gemini.” When [Genesis defaulted on loans](/2022/11/16/23462180/crypto-genesis-brokerage-suspends-withdrawals-ftx-collapse)
    in November 2022 and [filed for bankruptcy](/2023/1/20/23472388/genesis-lending-digital-currency-group-bankrupt-ftx-crypto-winter)
    last year, around 200,000 Gemini Earn customers were unable to access $1.1 billion
    (valued at around $1.8 billion today) in funds.

    Gemini says that if the settlement is approved, it will result in “all Earn users
    receiving 100% of their digital assets back in kind.” The company says customers
    can expect to receive 97 percent of assets in around two months, while the remainder
    could arrive over the next year.

    and seek the return of their assets,” Gemini says. “Being able to return assets
    on a coin-for-coin basis to our customers was critical for us.”

    from New York Attorney General Letitia James that alleges Gemini, Genesis, and
    Genesis parent company Digital Currency Group “lied to investors and tried to
    hide more than a billion dollars in losses.” However, [James expanded the lawsuit](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/02/09/ny-attorney-general-expands-crypto-lawsuit-sees-3-billion-fraud-.html)
    earlier this month and now claims the three companies’ schemes resulted in losses
    amounting to $3 billion.'
