    and wants regarding the browser they use on their devices. [Google Chrome](https://www.windowscentral.com/tag/google-chrome)
    and [Microsoft Edge](https://www.windowscentral.com/tag/microsoft-edge) are arguably
    the most popular browsers among users, but is it by choice or design?

- en: The folks at Mozilla have openly indicated that it's the latter, further throwing
    blame at Microsoft. The company pointed out that users [don't have free will to
    use any browser as their default on Windows devices](https://research.mozilla.org/browser-competition/over-the-edge-the-use-of-design-tactics-to-undermine-browser-choice/).

    experts, to investigate the matter. As it turns out, Microsoft might be playing
    a foul game by preventing freedom of choice when selecting default browsers on
    Windows ([via TechRadar](https://www.techradar.com/computing/browsers/mozilla-blows-the-whistle-on-microsoft-over-the-edge-report-accuses-windows-11-maker-of-browser-bias-and-deceptive-tactics)).

    EU Commission](https://www.windowscentral.com/microsoft/microsoft-added-to-eu-gatekeeper-list-but-bing-and-edge-are-under-investigation)
    last year. Microsoft made the list because of its Windows OS and LinkedIn, and
    Google for its Chrome browser and search engine. The Commission gave the gatekeepers
    six months to comply with the DMA; failure would attract hefty fines and penalties.
    One of the requirements under the DMA tasks the companies listed to make their
    services interoperable.

    but the company argued that [the search engine hadn't hit the threshold to fall
    under this category](https://www.windowscentral.com/software-apps/bing/microsoft-argues-bing-isnt-big-enough-to-make-eus-gatekeeper-list-says-report).
    The Commission investigated the matter and recently concluded that [Bing and Edge
    aren't dominant enough in digital markets](https://www.windowscentral.com/microsoft/microsoft-edge-and-bing-might-get-a-free-pass-from-europes-dma-since-they-arent-dominant-enough-in-digital-markets),

    breathing space and the opportunity to compete on an even playing field. But as
    it happens, that ship has seemingly sailed off with its competitive advantage.
    Microsoft's CEO, Satya Nadella, shares the same sentiments regarding search, adding
    that [Google doesn't play fair with Bing](https://www.windowscentral.com/software-apps/bing/google-doesnt-play-fair-with-bing-says-microsoft-ceo-satya-nadella).

    and search engine down users' throats. Late last year, some users trying to download
    Google Chrome while using Microsoft Edge were slapped with a survey asking them
    to detail [why they wanted to try another browser](https://www.windowscentral.com/software-apps/browsing/edge-begs-for-answers-microsoft-polling-users-who-download-chrome).

    download page, perhaps to prevent users from transitioning? The fact that Windows
    11 and 10 come with Microsoft Edge preinstalled doesn't improve the situation.
