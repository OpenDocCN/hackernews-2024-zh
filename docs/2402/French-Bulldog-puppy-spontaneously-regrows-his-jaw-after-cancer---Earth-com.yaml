    was initially brought to Cornell’s Dentistry and Oral Surgery Service for a cleft
    palate operation.

    mandible. Dr. Alexandra Wright, D.V.M. ’18, who spearheaded Tyson’s treatment,
    identified the tumor as an [oral papillary squamous cell carcinoma](https://vcahospitals.com/know-your-pet/oral-tumors-squamous-cell-carcinoma)
    — a rare but aggressive cancer in dogs.

    to other sites in the body, “we decided to give him a chance and continue with
    surgery. We had no idea his jaw would grow back!”
