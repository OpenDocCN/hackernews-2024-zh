- en: Years ago I used to do talks on [advanced Git stuff](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiKJqtppKSM&ref=blog.gitbutler.com).
    For the last decade or so, I've sort of assumed that everyone knew all the advanced
    command line stuff by now.

    about Git and GitButler and I’ve found that *lots* of people don’t know a *lot*

    having to switch to it from something else or relearn previous concepts from SVN

    years ago. Git has learned some stuff. Most of the changes are subtle or very
    targeted, but they could be useful to people, so I figured this would be a good
    time to do a little survey of some interesting Git things that might be new to
    you for whatever reason.

    many for one blog post", so instead I'll do a small series covering a few topics
    each.

    to advanced Git users that you may not know, either because they just never came
    up or because they're pretty new and you've been using Git the same way for years.
