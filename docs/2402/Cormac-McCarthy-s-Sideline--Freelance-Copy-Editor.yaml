- en: When Cormac McCarthy died last year, critics, scholars, and fans alike weighed
    in on the qualities they found most distinctive in his books. Time and again they
    mentioned his style. Whether the long, sweeping passages of *Blood Meridian* or
    the staccato bursts of *The Road,* McCarthy’s approach was unified by an elegant
    minimalism most evident in, of all things, his punctuation.

    from one of the Pulitzer-winning novelist’s rare interviews. The first is recognizable
    by the quotation marks absent from his dialogue; he eschewed them. Same with the
    semicolon I just used and exclamation points. “There is no place in English literature
    for either,” [he said](https://www.wsj.com/articles/cormac-mccarthy-was-a-man-of-science-sante-fe-literature-math-physics-85fca729).

    said McCarthy. A scan of his books reveals additional use of question marks and
    em dashes—even the rare semicolon and exclamation mark(!)—but McCarthy’s punctuation
    was sparse by any measure.

    “He is absolutely at peace with his own rhythms and has complete confidence in

    for his opinions, occasionally manifested by lending his editorial aid to other

    He preferred the company of scientists and actually moved to New Mexico to be
    close to the Santa Fe Institute, a multidisciplinary think tank. “I’m here because
    I like science, and this is a fun place to spend time,” [he told](https://www.newsweek.com/cormac-mccarthy-santa-fe-institutes-brainy-halls-65701)  *Newsweek*
    journalist Nick Romeo in 2012\. He joined the board of trustees and kept an office

    and economists.

    1996, maybe for the first time. W. Brian Arthur was a fellow at the institute
    and had written an article on a new theory called increasing returns for *Harvard
    Business Review*. Arthur sent a draft to McCarthy and later called to see what
    he thought.

    case, and the article went on to become [one of the most influential](https://hbr.org/1996/07/increasing-returns-and-the-new-world-of-business)
    the *Review* ever published. “The theory of increasing returns is as important

- en: McCarthy continued to edit papers and books for scientists orbiting around the
    institute for the next couple of decades. When McCarthy heard about theoretical
    physicist Lisa Randall‘s first book, *Warped Passages*, then only in manuscript,
    he asked to read a draft. For an author who banged out almost everything he ever
    wrote on a typewriter, McCarthy naturally worked in hard copy.

    semicolons, which he really didn’t like.” McCarthy noted all the offending marks
    in the margins; from there Randall purged them. And McCarthy gored other glyphs
    as well.

    physicist and cosmologist Lawrence Krauss’s biography of Richard Feynman, *Quantum
    Man*, in hardcover McCarthy loved it—or nearly did. “I think the book is almost
    perfect,” [he told Krauss](https://www.wsj.com/articles/cormac-mccarthy-was-a-man-of-science-sante-fe-literature-math-physics-85fca729).

    “He made me promise he could excise all exclamation points and semicolons, both
    of which he said have no place in literature.” McCarthy then “went through the
    book in detail and made suggestions for rephrasing in certain points as well.”

- en: This deep and thorough engagement bears directly on his editorial eye. It’s
    all about clarity of thinking and expression. “Science is very rigorous,” he told
    Kushner. “When you hang out with scientists and see how they think, you can’t
    do so without developing a respect for it. And part of what you respect is their
    rigor. When you say something, it needs to be right.”

    his writing and editing advice down to a list of bullet points; the two had collaborated
    on Savage’s papers since the biologist first arrived at the institute in 2000\.

    McCarthy’s total literary approach. Another point they stress: the adventure of

    and writing, something he told Nick Romeo. “Both,” he said, “involve curiosity,
