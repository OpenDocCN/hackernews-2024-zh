- en: The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) has ruled that laws requiring crippled
    encryption and extensive data retention violate the European Convention on Human
    Rights – a decision that may derail European data surveillance legislation known
    as Chat Control.

- en: The court issued a [decision](https://hudoc.echr.coe.int/eng/#%7B%22itemid%22:%5B%22001-230854%22%5D%7D)
    on Tuesday stating that "the contested legislation providing for the retention
    of all internet communications of all users, the security services’ direct access
    to the data stored without adequate safeguards against abuse and the requirement
    to decrypt encrypted communications, as applied to end-to-end encrypted communications,
    cannot be regarded as necessary in a democratic society."

- en: The "contested legislation" mentioned above refers to a legal challenge that
    started in 2017 after a demand from Russia's Federal Security Service (FSB) that
    messaging service Telegram provide technical information to assist the decryption
    of a user's communication. The plaintiff, Anton Valeryevich Podchasov, challenged
    the order in Russia but his claim was dismissed.

- en: In 2019, Podchasov brought the matter to the ECHR. Russia joined the [Council
    of Europe](https://www.coe.int/en/web/portal) – an international human rights
    organization – in 1996 and was a member until it withdrew in March 2022 following
    its illegal invasion of Ukraine. Because the 2019 case predates Russia's withdrawal,
    the ECHR continued to consider the matter.

- en: The court concluded that the Russian law requiring Telegram "to decrypt end-to-end
    encrypted communications risks amounting to a requirement that providers of such
    services weaken the encryption mechanism for all users." As such, the court considers
    that requirement disproportionate to legitimate law enforcement goals.

    to countries in Europe that are contemplating similar decryption laws – such as
    [Chat Control](https://www.patrick-breyer.de/en/posts/chat-control/) and the UK
    government's [Online Safety Act](https://www.theregister.com/2023/10/27/online_safety_act_charles/).

    is shorthand for European data surveillance legislation that would require internet
    service providers to scan digital communications for illegal content – specifically
    child sexual abuse material and potentially terrorism-related information. Doing
    so would necessarily entail weakening the encryption that keeps communication
    private.'

    on all smartphones proposed by the EU Commission in its chat control bill is clearly
    illegal," said Breyer.'
