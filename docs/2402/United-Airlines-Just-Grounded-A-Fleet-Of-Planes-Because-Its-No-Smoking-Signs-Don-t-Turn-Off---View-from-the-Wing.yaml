    that a cabin interior issue had come up with United Airlines Airbus A321neo aircraft.
    He highlighted a delayed flight where the aircraft was being swapped with a Boeing
    737, and then another Airbus A321neo flight swapped, and then another.

    are on the ground, and all flights the rest of the day that were scheduled to
    be operated by these planes have been given new aircraft (of a different type).'

    Only two are in the air and all later scheduled A321neo flights for today are
    swapped to 737 and A319/320 due to some sort of "operational inspection." [https://t.co/PJ9i1QRzn4](https://t.co/PJ9i1QRzn4)

    It turns out there’s a stupid regulation that hasn’t been needed in decades, and
    United ran afoul of it. Miller points out,

    operable by crew, despite smoking being prohibited on board for decades.

    must be operable by a member of the flightcrew” and United’s signs on these aircraft
    are *always on* and therefore not ‘operable’ by a member of the crew.

    signs “hardwired to stay illuminated at all times” according to the filing. United
    just forgot to ask for the same regulatory waiver for the A321neo as for these
    aircraft. This is a new plane type for the airline. They have 5 currently in service,
    with another 125 on order.

    For instance, American Airlines gave away that they were adding doors to their
    business class seats on new aircraft when they asked the FAA for an exemption
    to permit this. The FAA [initially rejected the request because the letterhead
    American used didn’t include its mailing address](https://viewfromthewing.com/faa-refuses-to-consider-americans-request-to-put-doors-on-business-class-seats/)
    (they presumably could have just asked [their own American Airlines Certificate
    Management Office](https://www.faa.gov/about/office_org/field_offices/cmo/amr)
    instead).

    at the start of the pandemic, even though passengers were permitted to bring on
    their own and the FAA had already determined this was safe.

    1971\. Delta was the first to fully ban smoking worldwide in 1994\. U.S. airlines
    were no longer permitted to allow smoking on any flight starting in 2000\. Yet
    planes still have ashtrays! You’ll usually find them in or near the lavatory,
    because customers may smoke even though it’s illegal to do so. Passengers need
    to be told when not to smoke. And crewmembers need to be able to turn on that
    sign. If they can’t turn it on, because it is always on, then an exemption from
    the rule must be requested. Oops!
