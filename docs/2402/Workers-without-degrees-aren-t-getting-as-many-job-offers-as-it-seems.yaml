    from Burning Glass Institute and Harvard Business School focuses on how companies
    stack up in their efforts to hire non-degreed workers. This is important to U.S.
    workers, more than half of whom don't have degrees, since it impacts their ability
    to get higher-paying jobs and better roles.

    doesn't mean these workers are actually getting the jobs, and in fact, there's
    limited public evidence to date to support how corporate efforts are shaping up.
    The research from Burning Glass is an effort to quantify that. It's based on limited
    data and doesn't consider alternative pathways that people without degrees use
    to join organizations, such as through apprenticeships and internships. But it's
    still a snapshot look at how some of the top employers in the U.S. are doing in
    their efforts to hire more workers based on skills versus degree attainment.

- en: The move to hire people without degrees is important because of the large number
    of people who fall into this bucket. U.S. Census bureau data shows that about
    62% of Americans don't have degrees. The push to hire more of these workers doesn't
    apply to low-level jobs that never required a degree or professional positions
    like doctors or lawyers. What's at stake here are the middle-tier jobs like construction
    managers, sales supervisors, web developers, cybersecurity and IT help desk specialists.
    These jobs typically require certain skills sets and training, but not necessarily
    a four-year degree.

    workers without an undergraduate degree step into a role that previously required
    a degree, they experience a roughly 25% increase in salary, on average. That amounts
    to more than $12,400 in incremental earnings per year.

    recommends job-seekers use the index to compare companies in the same sector since
    there can be vast differences in their hiring and promotion practices for non-degreed
    workers. Fuller said he doesn't doubt commitment at the management level for any
    of the companies named in the report, but said that policy pronouncements can
    only go so far. "They can announce good intentions but they have to execute against
    those good intentions," he said.

    of 65 million American workers, which Burning Glass says represents about 40%
    of the U.S. workforce. The 11,300 roles included in the sample are ones for which
    researchers say they could observe a meaningful volume of hiring for at least
    one year before and after a firm removed a degree requirement.

    profile suggests it's not a lack of talent that's impeding skills-based hiring
    efforts, Sigelman said. Rather, it implies managers may be reticent to hire people
    without degrees, absent specific policies to assess these workers' skills. If
    there are two candidates — one with a degree, one without, "to many hiring managers,
    it will feel risky," he said.

    hiring that they say could help others further their success. For one, "they call
    attention to people throughout the organization who are crushing it without degrees,"

    for hiring managers to take a chance on hiring someone without a degree."

    clearly the skills they require for a job, even before posting it. According to
    Sigelman, they ask hiring managers to be specific about the skills they are looking
    for and also what they would consider evidence of somebody having acquired those
    skills.

- en: Additionally, leaders in skill-based hiring have processes to assess the skills
    they are seeking. For instance, they might ask job prospects to submit projects
    for a candidate-blind review by hiring managers. This allows companies to assess
    "who fundamentally did the best project without knowing whose work it was," Sigelman
    said.
