- en: Having a solid intent behind reading a paper or fully understanding its content
    absolutely helps motivate your reading. Also, it provides the proper lens to reading
    that paper. If you need to understand the intricate details then it will take
    more time, but you know you only need to read to understand the core part, not
    any fluff language that isn't giving you the relevant info.

    can start here and reread if ya need more depth. Same applies to needing only
    certain sections of the text.

    when your brain thinks or wants to do something else, treat yourself to that something
    else after 2 or 5 minutes more. Repeat until you're not making progress.

    do tasks. Could try mindfulness meditation, or yoga. Tons of things to try to
    figure out what works best for you.

    work, then prioritize that prior knowledge first. Same can go for practicing skills
    or really understanding key concepts.

- en: Hold yourself accountable by working on it for some set amount of time a day
    or week. Tracking the time you commit to an activity can be useful when to encourage
    you to do more if you only did a bit. Or reading it for some time before throwing
    on a video or playing or worse, social media scrolling. High dopamine activities
    will make ya want more of them so do em later in day and do the reading earlier
    in the day. Sleep will reset your brain.

    and concepts over with. You could take a rubber duck approach where they didn't
    read it but will listen and ask thoughtful questions if being more responsive
    than an actual rubber duck. If your friend or colleague also read it then discussing
    can help you both understand it.

    Works great esp. When targeting non experts.

    slow down and fully comprehend the text, Sometimes along with writing out the
    key points in note form. Same goes for attempting to make visuals or trying out
    the thing I was learning with hands on experience. Basically do all the learning
    styles. üòÜ

- en: I have had multiple papers and books be daunting to me, esp. throughout the
    literature review for my ongoing paper. These have covered a wide range of intertwining
    fields, including, probabilistic and algorithmic statistics, math, machine learning
    theory, & computability theory. In this case the problem and breadth was daunting.
    That's okay because I wanted to learn this and do this.

- en: After all that I found papers to be "daunting" as in "I don't want to decipher
    the jargon to understand the intricacies from this niche field that is incredibly
    new and not as well formalized as the rest" (looking at you, algorithmic statistics).
    This is an important difference from feeling that I couldn't understand the text.
    I had the latter feeling more in studying during undergrad and early graduate
    school. The more you learn, the more you find overlapping patterns you can leverage
    and also realize the more others don't know and that's alright because you wouldn't
    want to force people to have to do all that reading you had to do.

    philosophy doesn't tend to be those kind of writers, in my experience. Physicists,
    now they get to the point.
