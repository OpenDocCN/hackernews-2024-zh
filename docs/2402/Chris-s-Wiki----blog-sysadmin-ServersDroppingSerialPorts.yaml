    long time is [a serial console server](/~cks/space/blog/sysadmin/ConsoleServerSetup),
    which is to say a server that collects and logs serial console output from all
    of our regular servers (this is primarily [Linux kernel messages](/~cks/space/blog/linux/ManyConsolesOfLinux),
    as [we've moved away from making the serial port the 'real' kernel console](/~cks/space/blog/sysadmin/DroppingSerialConsoles)).
    To date we've done this through actual serial ports on the servers, which we set
    up as an additional console. However, this has an obvious issue, which is that
    your servers need actual serial ports.

    port (often right besides the basic VGA video out; servers may be the last refuge
    of that particular connector). However, recently we discovered that we've received
    a mainstream server that doesn't have such a serial port, and it's not a basic
    1U server either; it's the 24-bay SuperMicro hardware for our new (hardware) generation
    of fileservers. The only option for a serial console on this hardware will be
    Serial-over-LAN as part of its [IPMI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligent_Platform_Management_Interface)
    implementation.

- en: (We've poked a bit at Serial over LAN before, but there have been a number of
    blockers, including that [Linux only supports sending kernel messages to a single
    serial console](/~cks/space/blog/linux/KernelSerialConsoleOnlyOne) so to date
    that's been the physical serial port.)

- en: This is a switch that I've been vaguely expecting to happen for a while, but
    it's still sort of a surprise to see signs of it actually happening. The physical
    hardware for a serial port does add some cost and take up some space, and these
    days it can't be very heavily used, and IPMI has supported Serial over LAN for
    some time now. In a way it's surprising that serial ports on servers have lasted
    this long.

- en: (Or perhaps server serial ports are more popular and heavily used in the industry
    than I expect. And certainly IPMI support has had problems in the past, when vendors
    often didn't give the [BMC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligent_Platform_Management_Interface)
    its own network port, which generally meant that you had to keep it off the network
    entirely.)

    to implement our serial console server is increasingly old and I don''t think
    equivalents are being made today. It''s been very reliable so far, but sooner
    or later it''s going to start failing.'
