- en: Don't get me wrong, there are pockets of good code quality. Isolated instances
    of true care and craftsmanship. But, by and large, what I see now is people trying
    to ship products as fast as possible without regard for the maintenance burden
    1, 2, 5, 10 years down the road.

- en: Big tech is all about considering "impact" when evaluating engineer performance
    and making promotion decisions. Unfortunately, "impact" is almost always measured
    by what features you shipped rather than considering the *impact* your code had
    on the long-term maintainability of the codebase.

    (nothing wrong with either of these things) then it only makes sense that you
    ship *more* features—even if the code you're committing is lower quality.

    likely to be in an Agile™ environment in which you get overloaded with tasks.
    Should you focus on improving the quality of the feature you're working on? Or
    should you get on to the other 17 tasks you have this sprint?

    time to get this right." But junior and mid-level engineers? They need to keep
    up to make sure they're not considered "slow."

- en: Many of us are now shipping our products over the internet. In some cases, they're
    fully web-based and in other cases we can ship patches over the web. Regardless,
    we're hardly ever shipping out a physical CD where we have to be damn well sure
    the software works. We *can* afford to "move fast and break things."

    codebases as well—things that slowly erode at the codebase's quality until we
    wake up one day and the whole thing feels like a mess.
