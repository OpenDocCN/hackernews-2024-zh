    Eng argued.

  zh: 如果[开发者](https://www.itpro.com/business-strategy/careers-training/358051/software-developers-versus-software-engineers)被迫在将新代码合并到主代码库之前进行安全测试，这将在很大程度上减少第一方代码中的缺陷，Eng

    [developers](https://www.itpro.com/business-strategy/careers-training/356509/how-to-become-a-software-developer)

- en: “The further that you shift [security testing] to the developer’s desktop and
    have them see it as early as possible so they can fix it, the better, because

- en: Another part of the solution, according to Eng, is encouraging firms to reevaluate
    how they prioritize tasks. If firms are smarter about which flaws they focus on
    fixing and how much capacity they are willing to allocate on these tasks, they
    can rapidly address their security vulnerabilities.

  zh: 根据 Eng 的说法，解决方案的另一部分是鼓励公司重新评估其任务优先级。如果公司在选择修复哪些缺陷和愿意为这些任务分配多少能力方面更加聪明，它们可以迅速解决安全漏洞。

    a new minor version … there’s no breakage barely ever, it's very simple. When

    one to version five there’s all sorts of breakage along the way”.

- en: “You can’t go directly there [version five], you’ve got to go from one to two
    to three to four and then every time you’ve got to run your tests, make sure something
