    of Art in New York is a container for something that few people have ever heard
    of: the *[lapis de Goa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goa_stone),* or “Goa stone.”'

- en: Goa stones were a compound of gold, crushed gemstones, herbs, bezoars, and other
    exotic substances popular in the 1690-1750 period. Like the [bezoars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chandelor_v_Lopus)
    they imitated, they were thought to offer a powerful protection against poisoning.
    Tiny flakes would be shaved off and consumed (I picture them being dropped in
    wine glasses) by wealthy consumers in India and Europe. As you can no doubt tell
    from the incredibly lavish decoration of this particular Goa stone container,
    they were *extremely* valuable.

    I argued for the usefulness of drugs and spices for helping us to better understand
    important aspects of human history. But aside from mentioning Paul Freedman’s
    great book *[Out of the East: Spices and the Medieval Imagination](https://yalebooks.yale.edu/book/9780300151350/out-of-the-east/),*

    agree with Freedman’s approach of seeing spices, herbs, medicinal animal products,
    and even gems as all occupying the same amorphous category in the medieval and
    early modern periods. They were all *medicinal simples*, the raw materials out
    of which *drugs* were made.

    be combined to form various compounds. Pharmacists had to know how to grind up
    mixtures of simples according to medical instructions or their own ingenuity.
    Pounding and grinding together these aromatic products was a tedious task and
    became a symbol of the art and labor of the medical or culinary expert in spices,
    the cook and the pharmacist. The mortar, an emblem of sophisticated cooking in
    the Middle Ages because of its use in grinding spices, has remained the preeminent
    symbol of pharmacists, just as the word ‘recipe’ in most languages means both
    instructions for cooks and prescriptions for druggists, a reminder of the conceptual
    similarity of the two professions.

    of [Bahadur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bahadur_Shah_of_Gujarat), a sultan
    of 16th century Gujarat who (according to the Portuguese physician Garcia de Orta)
    ate a kind of sweet, spiced candy composed of sugar, nutmeg, mace, camphor, opium,
    and cannabis which supposedly allowed him “to go to Portugal or Brazil or Turkey
    or Arabia or Persia” via hallucinatory, drug-induced dreams.

    states of consciousness *reduced* the capacity for thought—that they were a form
    of intoxication. But what if the pursuit of visionary states was, in some cultures,
    a constructive goal? In these “Dionysian” cultures, as she dubbed them, visionary
    or trance states offered a source of new knowledge, mutual understanding, and
    social cohesion, not an escape into fantasy.

    science of the era) inexplicable effects to the action of a magnet in attracting
    iron, spices don't seem to have been as reliable, as shown by the multiplicity
    of often contradictory recipes. This is important, not merely to show the deficiencies
    of medieval pharmacology, which are now self-evident, but to get an idea of what
    people thought medicines could do and what they were for. **It is not as obvious
    as saying that spices cured or prevented disease, because drugs were used not
    just to treat illness but to induce a more general, pleasurable atmosphere of
    well-being**.

    for instance, were often credited with saving the lives of users who had been
    poisoned. But it is also common to see them praised for “dispelling melancholy”
    or “lightening the spirits” and similarly vague terms. That search for a “pleasurable
    atmosphere of well-being” is, I think, a deeply underrated aspect of human nature.
