    mixtures of simples according to medical instructions or their own ingenuity.
    Pounding and grinding together these aromatic products was a tedious task and
    became a symbol of the art and labor of the medical or culinary expert in spices,
    the cook and the pharmacist. The mortar, an emblem of sophisticated cooking in
    the Middle Ages because of its use in grinding spices, has remained the preeminent
    symbol of pharmacists, just as the word ‘recipe’ in most languages means both
