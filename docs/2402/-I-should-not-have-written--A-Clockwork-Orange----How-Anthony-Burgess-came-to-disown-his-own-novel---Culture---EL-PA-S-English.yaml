- en: British author Anthony Burgess was inspired to write his best-known novel, *A
    Clockwork Orange* (1962), by the uncivil drift that he perceived among the youth
    of his time. That is why, a decade later, when headlines in the vein of “Police
    hunt the Clockwork Orange rapist gang” or “Child dies in Clockwork Orange war”
    started to appear in the press, he could not help but feel that something had
    gone tremendously wrong.

    have written the book because of this danger of misinterpretation,” he wrote in
    1985 in *Flame into Being*, a biography of D.H. Lawrence where he compared the
    scandal caused by *Lady Chatterley’s Lover* (1928) with the controversy surrounding
    his popular dystopia. “If a couple of nuns are raped in the Vatican, I get a call
    from a newspaper. They have turned me into some kind of expert [on violence](https://english.elpais.com/culture/2023-12-11/fargo-is-back-to-bring-us-a-post-trump-cannibalistic-america.html),”

    writer and the title with which he went down in the history of 20th century literature
    – whether he liked it or not. The medium-length film is based on *The Clockwork
    Condition*, a manuscript written immediately after the release of the film and
    found after Burgess’ death, in which the author explained the themes of his novel
    and defended himself against those who accused him of glorifying crime. “All works
    of art are dangerous. My little son tried to fly after seeing Disney’s *Peter
    Pan*. I grabbed his legs just as he was about to take off from a fourth story
    window,” he stated. His desire to explain, and even vindicate himself, contrasted

    delinquent who, along with his three *droogs* (friends, according to the Nadsat
    language that they use to communicate), systematically beats and rapes until he
    is finally arrested. With the aim of getting out of prison as soon as possible,
    he volunteers for an experimental treatment known as the Ludovico technique, a
    behavioral conditioning therapy that erases all violent impulses from him. Deprived
    of moral choice, he becomes a person with no free will who is insulted and humiliated
    by everyone around him. The title, *A Clockwork Orange*, alludes, in the words
    of its author, to “the application of a mechanistic morality to a living organism
    oozing with juice and sweetness.”

    the novella *A Clockwork Orange* in 1962, which ought to be far enough in the
    past for it to be erased form the world’s literary memory. [...] I should myself
    be glad to disown it for various reasons,” he wrote. However, “it seems likely
    to survive, while other works of mine that I value more bite the dust.” He continued:
    “To sit down in a dull room and compose the *Missa Solemis* or *The Anatomy of
    the Melancholy* does not make headlines or news flashes. Unfortunately my little

    conflict with the film not so much in its depiction of violence (“Kubrick turns
    violence into farce. He puts you in the position of wondering if you should laugh,”
    states writer Will Self, one of the interviewees) as in its omission of the final
    part, chapter 21, in which Alex actually reforms. The absence of that last piece
    was the result of an intervention by the American editor, who eliminated the chapter
    thinking that the outcome proposed in the previous pages was more suggestive.
    Kubrick thought so, too. In the film and in the American edition of the book,
    the effects of the Ludovico technique were reversed and Alex was able to go back
    to committing crimes at will. However, in Burgess’ complete text, Alex’s encounter
    with one of his former *droogs*, now married and with his own apartment, makes
    him reflect on his life and choose to abandon violence to start a family. A [reach

    as an example of the British dystopia of the 20th century (not in vain Burgess
    was a big admirer of George Orwell), *A Clockwork Orange* was an experiment in
    its author’s canon, although, in Valls’ opinion, it is not necessarily an orphan
    novel. “It diverts from his line, which is marked by the contemplation of the
    colonial world or his experience during his stays in Southeast Asia, but the problems
    that have to do with the definition of good and evil are inherent to his own work.”
    It is also not something that can be easily rejected. “What surrounded the film
    did not sit well with him. I think it was a subjective reaction. It’s a novel
