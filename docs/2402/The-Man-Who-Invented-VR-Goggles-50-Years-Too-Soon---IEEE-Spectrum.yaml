    coined the term “science fiction” as the editor and publisher of *Amazing Stories*,
    the first magazine devoted to the burgeoning genre, which he launched in 1926\.
    The [Hugo Awards](https://www.thehugoawards.org/) for science fiction and fantasy
    are named after him.'

    whose many ideas included a “[combined electric hair brush and comb](https://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect2=PTO1&Sect2=HITOFF&p=1&u=/netahtml/PTO/search-bool.html&r=1&f=G&l=50&d=PALL&RefSrch=yes&Query=PN/1016138),”

    eyeglasses [above]. A [*Life* magazine profile of Gernsback](https://books.google.com/books?id=JlIEAAAAMBAJ&lpg=PA62&dq=the%20amazing%20hugo%20gernsback%2C%20prophet%20of%20science&pg=PA68#v=onepage&q=the%20amazing%20hugo%20gernsback,%20prophet%20of%20science&f=false)

    to others. His television eyeglasses—a device for which he feels millions yearn—constitute
    a case in point. When the idea for this handy, pocket-size portable TV set occurred
    to him in 1936, he was forced to dismiss it as impractical. But a few weeks ago,
    feeling that the electronics industry was catching up with his New Deal-era concepts,
    he orders some of his employees to build a mock-up.

    tubes that ran on low-voltage current from tiny batteries. (The user faced no
    danger of being electrocuted, Gernsback promised.) Because there was a separate
    screen for each eye, it could display stereoscopic images—much like today’s 3D
    virtual-reality glasses. Noting the massive V-type antenna protruding from the
    teleyeglasses, *Life* described the effect as “neo-Martian.” To be fair, modern
    VR goggles are only slightly less geeky looking than Gernsback’s.

    promoted many other futuristic ideas that have since become a reality: radar,
    microfilm, telemedicine, computer matchmaking, wireless spectrum regulation, bone-conduction
    hearing aids, tape recorders, electronic newspapers, and personal health trackers.
    The world is still waiting on some of his notions, though, including lunar mining,
    orbital mirror arrays, and the teleportation of ham sandwiches.'
