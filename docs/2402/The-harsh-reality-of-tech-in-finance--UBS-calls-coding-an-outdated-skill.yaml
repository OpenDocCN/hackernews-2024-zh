    of AI taking over their jobs and it''s more than mere paranoia. In a blog post
    this week, [UBS''s](/news/this-is-why-ubs-bankers-were-complaining-about-their-bonuses)
    chief economist Paul Donovan wrote "much of computer coding already has the look
    of a stranded asset," something that "loses its value earlier than expected."'

    skills "vulnerable," and notes that they become "obsolete more quickly than other

    recruitment firm Affinity North, says that fundamental aspects of STEM, such as
    problem-solving and critical thinking, "will only be more in demand as the complexity
    of our technological world increases.

    and more about "the process of using building blocks to piece together larger
    applications." AI makes things easier, but "someone still needs to visualize the
    required building blocks and how to fit them together.

    and became more easily able to deal with low-level code details themselves. While
    there are multiple layers to the process in which software is executed, "layering
    doesn‚Äôt mean the hard work is done, and we no longer need outstanding developers,"
    he says. Even now, elite low-level coders have only had their stock rise through

    prompt engineering takes center stage over traditional coding. "The same/similar
