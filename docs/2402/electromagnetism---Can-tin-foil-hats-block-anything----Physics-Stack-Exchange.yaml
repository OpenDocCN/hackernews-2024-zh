- en: '*Anything*? Sure. As already noted by Daniel Griscom''s answer, tin foil can
    block several "things" including rain, alpha rays, and electromagnetic radiation
    with small enough wave length that the radiation cannot diffract around the edges
    of the hat.'

- en: 'Since you mention frequency let''s really focus on electromagnetic radiation.
    Foil, being a metal, is very good at reflecting electromagnetic radiation. You
    can see this quite easily by looking at a sheet of aluminum/tin foil: it is shiny
    and you may even see a reflection of yourself. Physically this happens because
    electrons can move easily within the foil. Electromagnetic radiation impinging
    on the foil causes these electrons to move, and that motion produces new electromagnetic
    radiation which generates new radiation which destructively interferes with the
    original incoming radiation. This leads to cancellation of the *incoming* wave
    so that it does not penetrate the foil, and creation of a new *outgoing* wave
    which is the reflection you see.'

- en: Now this isn't the whole story. Radiation with a wavelength at about the same
    size as the hat actually winds up resonating inside the hat. In an effect similar
    to a vibration of a violin/guitar string, radiation that fits nicely inside the
    metal cavity formed by the hat actually winds up creating electromagnetic fields
    which are *bigger* than the incoming field. You can get a rough idea of how this
    works on the Wikipedia page for [resonance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resonance).
    It's the same effect as when you blow gently over a bottle and hear a loud hum
    sound.

    In addition, all helmets exhibited a marked 20 db attenuation at around 1.5 Ghz,

- en: Note that resonance is not the same thing as amplification. Amplification means
    an increase in power; you can only get that if you have a power source, as in
    a radio receiver which amplifies the signal coming in over the air waves. Resonance
    is an effect wherein (at least in this case) the incoming flow of energy winds
    up being sort of piled up into the hat so that the fields in the hat are larger
    than the fields coming in. It doesn't add new energy to the system, it just concentrates
    it in the hat.

  zh: 请注意，共振并不等同于放大。放大意味着增加功率；你只有在有功率源时才能实现这一点，比如无线电接收器，它放大通过空气传播的信号。共振是一种效应，在这种情况下，能量的流入在帽子中堆积起来，使得帽子中的电场比传入的电场更大。它并不向系统中添加新的能量，只是将能量集中在帽子内部。

    hat design that is, not a Faraday cage suit (with matching tie).

- en: Radio waves have pretty big wave length. For example, a 100 MHz wave has a length
    of 3 meters. If you want to block that out you need something like a [Faraday
    cage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faraday_cage) with holes a substantial fraction
    smaller than that wave length.

  zh: 无线电波的波长相当长。例如，100 MHz的波长为3米。如果你想屏蔽这些波，就需要像[法拉第笼](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faraday_cage)一样，孔径远小于这个波长的实质部分。
