    block several "things" including rain, alpha rays, and electromagnetic radiation
    with small enough wave length that the radiation cannot diffract around the edges
    of the hat.'

    Foil, being a metal, is very good at reflecting electromagnetic radiation. You
    can see this quite easily by looking at a sheet of aluminum/tin foil: it is shiny
    and you may even see a reflection of yourself. Physically this happens because
    electrons can move easily within the foil. Electromagnetic radiation impinging
    on the foil causes these electrons to move, and that motion produces new electromagnetic
    radiation which generates new radiation which destructively interferes with the
    original incoming radiation. This leads to cancellation of the *incoming* wave
    so that it does not penetrate the foil, and creation of a new *outgoing* wave
    which is the reflection you see.'

    size as the hat actually winds up resonating inside the hat. In an effect similar
    to a vibration of a violin/guitar string, radiation that fits nicely inside the
    metal cavity formed by the hat actually winds up creating electromagnetic fields
    which are *bigger* than the incoming field. You can get a rough idea of how this
    works on the Wikipedia page for [resonance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resonance).
    It's the same effect as when you blow gently over a bottle and hear a loud hum
    sound.

    actually made the electromagnetic field strength inside that hats larger:'

    amplification at 1.2 Ghz, regardless of the position of the antenna on the cranium.
    In addition, all helmets exhibited a marked 20 db attenuation at around 1.5 Ghz,
    with no significant attenuation beyond 10 db anywhere else."*'

- en: Note that resonance is not the same thing as amplification. Amplification means
    an increase in power; you can only get that if you have a power source, as in
    a radio receiver which amplifies the signal coming in over the air waves. Resonance
    is an effect wherein (at least in this case) the incoming flow of energy winds
    up being sort of piled up into the hat so that the fields in the hat are larger
    than the fields coming in. It doesn't add new energy to the system, it just concentrates
    it in the hat.

    hat design that is, not a Faraday cage suit (with matching tie).

    of 3 meters. If you want to block that out you need something like a [Faraday
    cage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faraday_cage) with holes a substantial fraction
    smaller than that wave length.
