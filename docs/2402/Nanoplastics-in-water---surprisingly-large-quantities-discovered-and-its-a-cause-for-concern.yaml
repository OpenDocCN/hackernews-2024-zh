    and gastrointestinal barrier ([Source](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2589914723000051)).
    Since they are closer to the size of proteins, they pose a risk to cell interactions
    too ([Source](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2589914723000051)).
    This is in contrast to microplastics, which typically are not able to cross these
    barriers. All of these increase the risk, but still need further validation studies
    for human impact, which I suspect are very hard to achieve given the lack of detection
    methods for nanoplastics.

    plastic additives. There is at least one researched example where nanoplastics
    had up to twice the absorption capacity of PCBs (polychlorinated biphenyls) vs.
    microplastics ([Source](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2589914723000051)).

    - which could have the potential to mechanically disturb our biological fabric
    and are more prone to carry directly toxic materials with them when compared to
    microplastics.

    came out, which was able to count and identify really tiny sized plastic particles
    in bottled drinking water. One of the big problem with nanoplastics is that there
    are not many ways to identify them. Most of the previous work relied on tedious
    methodologies cycling through multiple lab based techniques, where some tests
    can take multiple hours for one sample. Despite the new method, detection remains
    an issue, especially for real world applications.

    intake of microplastics, adding an additional 90k particles per year (Source -
    [previous blog post](https://molecularspec.substack.com/p/microplastics-how-much-do-we-consume?r=yu7ek&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web)).
    This new research casts new light on that figure - the impact could have been
    underestimated by a factor of hundreds to thousands.

    to make up the majority of the nanoplastics weight, while in third it was majority
    PET.

- en: These findings of the composition of nanoplastics are surprising. PET makes
    up the vast majority of water bottling market [at around 80%](https://bottledwater.org/packaging/),
    so intuitively it makes sense that it ends up migrating into the water. Meanwhile
    PA is not typically used for water bottles. PA in food packaging is a somewhat
    harder film used for cheeses / meats among others.

- en: Given that PA is not usually used for bottling, there is room for a theory that
    some of the nanoplastics did not originate from the bottles, but rather might
    have come from water processing or the source water itself. [Authors](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2300582121)
    point that all three brands tested produce water with the method of reverse osmosis,
    where membranes used are made of PA.

    used in bottling water, meaning tap water can also be impacted.

    theory says that a 2mm PVC piece will settle at the rate of 87cm/s, while a 100nm
    PVC piece will take over twelve(!) years to travel the same distance, at a settling
    rate of ~7cm/year ([Source](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2589914723000051)).'

    But if nanoplastics settle at rate of years, they might not get filtered out from
    it. In fact quite the opposite, there is research showing that nanoplastics inhibit
    the wastewater sludge process ([Source](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2589914723000051)).

    looking at tap water in Barcelona indeed found nanoplastics to the level of 2-9
    ng/L. This is less than the [bottled water paper](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2300582121)
    (6-11 ng/L) reviewed above. However, the tap water research was only able to cound
    particles down to 700 nm as opposed to down to 100 nm in bottled water.

    that our water might universally contain nanoplastics, which in turn can be a
    threat to human health. I am hoping for more research on particle counting in
    tap water (and filtration research) soon! We also need better understanding how
    the quantity / shape / weight of these compounds correlate to health risks.

    though the overall weight exposure is rather small), which could have increased
    health risks, out of the abundance of caution I would for now consider tap water
    as a safer alternative.

    highlighting high levels of nanoplastics in it. If/when that happens, only advanced
    water filtration without plastic parts could be a way to avoid nanoplastics.

- en: And finally a bit of a disclaimer - the relationship of nanoplastics quantities
    and human health risks needs to be established. It appears that nanoplastics have
    higher propensity to affect our bodies as compared to larger microplastics, but
    the intensity and type of the impact is yet to be established. As far as I can
    tell the validation of direct toxicity today relates mainly to plastic additives,
    such as plasticizers / phthalates etc. as covered in the [microplastics post](https://open.substack.com/pub/molecularspec/p/microplastics-how-toxic-and-what?r=yu7ek&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web&showWelcomeOnShare=true).
    The isolated mechanical accumulation of particles of plastic is less studied.
