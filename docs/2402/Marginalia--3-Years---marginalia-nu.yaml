    experiment to find where the heck the cool Internet has gone, now my full time
    job.

    engine has never worked as well as it does right now.

    engine has moved out of my living room and into a proper enterprise server.

- en: An overarching theme for the year has been cleaning up the code base and streamlining
    the application, not only to keep the operational workload manageable, but to
    make the application and codebase more accessible to other people, both operators
    and developers. It’s been a lot of work, but it’s beginning to pay off.

- en: It feels distant, but the search engine used to require days-long outages when
    switching indexes. This is gone. Since recently, it’s also capable of zero downtime
    upgrades. So much of the operational side used to be weeks-long manual processes,
    now you press a button in a GUI instead.

- en: Something which had an outsized impact was adding support for anchor text keywords.
    It’s made an incredible difference in the search engine’s ability to find relevant
    results. It wasn’t immediately apparant when the change was made, beacuse it initially
    wasn’t very well integrated, but as this new relevance signal settled in, that
    was a real wow moment.

    thanks to the generous people at nlnet. This has been a bit of a trip in its own
    regard. The hardest part about this has probably been not working *too* much,
    I’ve been trying to take at least one day off per week, and sometimes succeeding!
    I know I’m leaps and bounds smarter when I’m well rested, so actually resting
    sometimes should theoretically be in line with getting stuff done. It’s just so
    fun though&mldr;

- en: The quest to reach 1B indexed documents is slowly ongoing. It’s proving a bit
    harder than anticipated, not because the software can’t handle it, but because
    the signal to noise ratio of the web isn’t very good; a huge reason why the search
    engine works relatively well is because of what it doesn’t index. That said, the
    index has gone from 50-100M a year ago, to 220M last crawl, and likely 290-300M
    when the next crawl round is finished based on the growth of the two partitions
    that have already finished.

    of room for improvement in this area. I’m currently engaged in a bit of mise en
    place to clean up the affected code before the real work begins.

- en: That said, the grand leaps forward in this project has always been experimental,
    so even though things are planned, I think it’s fairly certain it’s the un-planned
    things that will be the ones to really make a dent. Like those anchor texts.

    thanks Patreons, thanks advocates, and users. This wouldn’t be possible without
    you.
