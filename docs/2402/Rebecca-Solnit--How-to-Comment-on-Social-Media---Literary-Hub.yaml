- en: 1) Do not read the whole original post or what it links to, which will dilute
    the purity of your response and reduce your chances of rebuking the poster for
    not mentioning anything they might’ve mentioned/written a book on/devoted their
    life to. Listening/reading delays your reaction time, and as with other sports,
    speed is of the essence.

    be in the first sentence anyway. Only fascists hide those things in militarized
    outposts throughout the terrain of the piece. Which are basically ambushes. Which
    is violent and elitist.

    fumes, whataboutism is your friend here. Just levy another charge, however unrelated.
    After all, any statement can be condemned for not including all other statements,
    aka O.P.’s concern about saving the whales is only a sign of his/her/their indifference
    about some other issue or cetacean or mammal or cause. There is always something.

    about/is complicit with. Every expression of concern is in fact an expression
    of unconcern about something else; each of them merits a rebuke and you have been
    appointed (by yourself, but nevermind) to deliver it. Everyone but you is indifferent
    to the plight of the greater sage grouse and needs to be reminded of it.

    feelings are facts, and those forty-seven increasingly lengthy responses you fired
    off were clearly a rational reaction. If she reacted negatively to them, do not
    forget to rebuke her for being emotional.

    are unfairly privileged over people who died in the year 1816, who you also speak
    for. How dare they love geese, who are privileged above poor wingless platypuses!

    bike more” really means all people need to bike everywhere under all circumstances
    and is callously indifferent to people who: live in Siberia and can’t bike through
    -40 blizzards; are physically unable to cycle; can’t afford bikes; and let us
    not forget those who have bicycle-related trauma. Which is why anyone who could
    say “people should bike more” is a fascist who needs crushing.'

    to you their commitments and beliefs, and their unwillingness to do so on demand
    is a sign of culpability too. Have they properly condemned the recent something
    or other? It is not your job to find proof; it is this complete stranger’s obligation
    to offer it up, and there is no reason they would not if they were not guilty
    as charged. Condemn them for insufficient condemnation issuance.

    Thunberg is against carbon dioxide emissions and yet emits carbon dioxide with
    every exhale. People who don’t like tech corporations are good targets for this
    too; they should build their movements through communicating by cuneiform tablet
    on clay harvested from local mudbanks; public transit advocates should have never
    traveled by car. Anyone who doesn’t like some aspect of life on earth they haven’t
    completely disassociated with is begging for your gotcha moment. And it will never
    have occurred to Greta that she breathes or to the transit advocate that their
    mom drove them places.'

    utterances—that Calvin Coolidge was a president, that koala bears are marsupials,
    that Kool and the Gang sang “Celebration.” This is particularly spicy with complete
    strangers.

    cared about it longer, deeper, harder than they have, and that even someone’s
    care can be a basis for your triumph, along with condemning them for all those
    other things they evidently do not care about.

    measure of someone’s commitment is how much they post about their commitment.
    Never mind if the noble cause is their day job, the thing they donate to extensively,
    the volunteer work they do; only the racket made online matters. Let the beginning
    and the end of thy commitment be the noise you make about that commitment (and
    others’ lack of commitment), and make it loud.

    medieval peasants should die, except in their case they already did, but still.

    is suffering, which many someones always are, so joy should be withdrawn, and
    anyway it’s neoliberal. There can be no good things until there are no bad things
