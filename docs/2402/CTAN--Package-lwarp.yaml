- en: This package converts LaTeX to HTML by using LaTeX to process the user’s document
    and generate HTML tags. External utility programs are only used for the final
    conversion of text and images. Math may be represented by SVG files or MathJax.
    Hundreds of LaTeX packages are supported, and their load order is automatically
    verified.

- en: Documents may be produced by LaTeX, LuaLaTeX, XeLaTeX, and by several CJK engines,
    classes, and packages. A `texlua` script automates compilation, index, glossary,
    and batch image processing, and also supports [latexmk](/pkg/latexmk). Configuration
    is semi-automatic at the first manual compile. Support files are self-generated.
    Print and HTML versions of each document may coexist.
