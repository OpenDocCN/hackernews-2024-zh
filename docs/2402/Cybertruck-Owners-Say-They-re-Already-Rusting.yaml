    [in the owner's manual](https://www.businessinsider.com/tesla-cybertruck-manual-road-salt-corrosion-steel-2024-1),
    in a passage that makes maintenance for the brutalist pickup sound exceedingly

    is a baffling design decision. The Cybertruck is meant to be a workhorse that
    can go anywhere at any time, per the EV maker's own marketing materials — not
    an expensive collector's item that you only take out under ideal conditions.

    Friend and Windex had restored it to its previous shininess.

    a mass-produced vehicle was the DeLorean, an eye-catching sports car famously
