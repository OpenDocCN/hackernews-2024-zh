    who wants to refactor the code base. Let‚Äôs say we want to change the internal
    structure of an object (like in the List example earlier, maybe we want to switch
    from an ArrayList to a LinkedList). But if other components are reliant on the
    internal state (in the case of the ArrayList: this could be the internal primitive
    array) we can not easily change it. We would need to find all places outside of
    the class where the internal structure is referenced. The problem gets even worse

    on each others internal structure they are highly coupled. ‚ÄúClass cohesion‚Äù describes
    the same characteristic but from a different perspective. It‚Äôs a measure of how

    state, and can potentially cause high object coupling. However, as with any dogma,

    is ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt use public properties, use getters and setters instead.‚Äù, which is completely
    wrong. In terms of encapsulation getters and setters are just as bad as public
    properties, as they do nothing to prevent object coupling. If you have a class

    example.

- en: '*sigh* This is a personal pet peeve of mine. We touched on this earlier but
    I would really like to hammer this part home: If you really need getters and setters
    for ever single member variable it‚Äôs probably not a proper object to start with.
    I‚Äôd highly encourage reconsidering your object model, try to reduce coupling.
    If it‚Äôs really a record class with no internal behavior, everything might as well
    be public ‚Äì there is hardly a point in using getters and setters. A similar thing
    (though admittedly it‚Äôs a better) applies to properties in languages like C#,
    and of course code generators like the infamous Lombok.'

- en: The only real reason for the use of getters and setters over public members,
    is when there is some additional logic like validation of invariants for example.

    make sure to not accidentally expose a modifiable reference to internal state.
    Otherwise you‚Äôve got setters ‚Äì just not intentionally.'

- en: I guess there are two topics that fit this heading. The first being the naming
    madness that has been established in enterprise software development. This is
    again not per se an issue with OOP although for some reason this seems to happen
    a lot more with OOP. I happen to be a Kevlin Henney fan, and he gave an [amazing
    talk on naming in programming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzJ94TMPcD8) at
    DevWeek 2015\. Among other things he talks about how naming can influence modelling.
    I highly recommend watching it.

- en: The second topic is the rabbit hole of design patterns, that are often blindly
    applied, seemingly without any thought on why exactly. Specifically, the factory
    pattern has some valid uses, but because people overuse the pattern so much it‚Äôs
    now synonymous with unnecessary abstractions.

- en: 'There are of course also established patterns where you should really have
    a damn good reason to actually use it ‚Äì at least in a strictly object-oriented
    context. Singletons for example. ‚ÄúSingleton‚Äù is in essence just a fancy name for
    a global variable ‚Äì great. Fun little side note: In the Spring framework Beans
    by default get the Singleton scope, meaning if not stated otherwise every single
    bean is global.'

- en: Another thing I‚Äôve been noticing with modern ‚Äúenterprise‚Äù applications is that
    they are not actually object-oriented. Entities, DTOs, ‚Ä¶ are records, not objects.
    Beans, Services, Repositories, ‚Ä¶ don‚Äôt hold state and could just as well be plain
    functions in modules.

    that don‚Äôt require objects ‚Äì Spring Boot could just as well be written in C.

    but I just wasn‚Äôt sure where to put it, so here you go. (I particularly like the
    stab against Python for throwing encapsulation out the window. üòÜ)
