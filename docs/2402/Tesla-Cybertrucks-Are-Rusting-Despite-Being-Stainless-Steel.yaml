    confidence in the long-term prospects of the boxy EV touted as bulletproof by

    the proportion of chromium, titanium, nickel, nitrogen and other additives, this
    results in very different properties. These range from better formability and
    a maximum degree of hardness to permanent rust resistance, even against acids.
