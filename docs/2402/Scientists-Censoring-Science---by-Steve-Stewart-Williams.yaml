    in the crown of our cultural achievements,” as I put it in my book *[The Ape That
    Understood the Universe](https://www.amazon.com/Ape-that-Understood-Universe-Culture/dp/1108732755/)*.
    But even a cursory glance at the history of science reveals that scientific claims
    haven’t always been greeted with open arms. New science has sometimes clashed
    with old orthodoxies, and reactions have often been negative. People have scoffed;
    people have turned away - and in some cases, they’ve sought to censor the scientists.
    When we think about scientific censorship, we usually imagine external institutions
    forcibly preventing scientists from speaking or promoting their ideas. The classic
    example, of course, is the Church’s censorship of Galileo’s heliocentric model
    of the solar system. But scientific censorship doesn’t always come from outside.
    Sometimes, it comes from within: from scientists themselves. Indeed, in the last
    decade or so, scientific self-censorship has become increasingly common - and
    although the motivations driving it are often laudable, the move toward censorship
    in science very likely does much more harm than good.'

    on which I’m co-author, published today in the journal *Proceedings of the National
    Academy of Sciences* (*PNAS*). The paper, titled “Prosocial Motives Underlie Scientific
    Censorship by Scientists,” was spearheaded by the inimitable Cory Clark, and co-authored
    by 38 academics representing a diverse range of expertise and political persuasions:
    Lee Jussim, Komi Frey, Sean Stevens, Musa al-Gharbi, Karl Aquino, Michael Bailey,
    Nicole Barbaro, Roy Baumeister, April Bleske-Rechek, David Buss, Steve Ceci, Marco

    Steven Pinker, Wilfred Reilly, Catherine Salmon, Philip Tetlock, Wendy Williams,
    Anne Wilson, Bo Winegard, George Yancey, William von Hippel, and yours truly.
    I have to say it’s an honor to see my name alongside such an amazing group of
    scholars.'

    what appears to be an increasing tendency within science to stifle certain unpopular
    claims - not because of low scientific quality but for other, non-scientific reasons.
    The claims in question tend to revolve around hot-button political issues such
    as sex, gender, and colonialism, and the attempts to censor these claims tend
    to come from a leftist or progressive perspective. Here are some of the examples
    of scientific self-censorship that we document and discuss in the paper:'

    studies reaching politically unpalatable conclusions may have a harder time negotiating
    the peer-review process than they would if the conclusions were flipped. As we
    note in our [paper](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2301642120), “When scholars misattribute
    their rejection of disfavored conclusions to quality concerns that they do not

    afflicting the modern academy, and nor is it the only form that matters. Bans
    on the teaching of critical race theory in several U.S. states are a contemporary
    [example](https://www.thefire.org/news/blogs/eternally-radical-idea/13-important-points-campus-k-12-critical-race-theory-debate)
    of the censorship of academia by government. But no paper can be about everything,
    and in our view, scientific self-censorship is a big enough problem to warrant
    serious attention of its own - especially given that, ironically, many scientists
    may self-censor on this topic.

    underpinning it are benevolent or actively prosocial. One common motive, for instance,
    is the desire to [protect](https://doi.org/10.1111/bjop.12580) vulnerable groups
    from harm. But the fact that censorship often comes from a good place doesn’t
    mean that it’s effects are necessarily good. On the contrary, we have ample reason
    to think that censoring science produces harms of its own that easily rival any
    produced by the science itself.

    to understand the world. By censoring findings on just one side of a politically
    charged topic, the scientific record may end up strongly supporting the other
    side, even when the other side is false. The figure below, taken from the paper,
    shows how this could happen.

    to understand the world, we also blunt our ability to make the world a better
    place. Successful interventions are more likely to emerge from an accurate picture
    of the world than an inaccurate one. As such, by impairing our understanding of
    the world, scientific self-censorship increases the chances that we’ll end up
    with interventions that don’t achieve their stated aims, and which waste time
    and energy that could otherwise be channeled into those that might.'

    to undermine the public’s trust in science. If people get the impression that
    universities and other science-producing institutions effectively forbid certain
    ideas, they’ll understandably stop trusting the ideas coming out of those institutions
    – including important, well-established findings such as climate change and vaccine
    efficacy. Moreover, if people come to see scientists as untrustworthy or politically
    biased, they’ll be unlikely to remain enthusiastic about funding science from
    the public coffers. It’s hard to overstate the harm that a slump in the credibility
    of science could produce.

    the quality of life of billions of the planet’s inhabitants. It has often done
    this in the face of considerable opposition from external, authoritarian institutions.
    Arguably, though, the biggest threat to science today, at least in the West, comes
    from within science rather than without. In many ways, scientific self-censorship
    is a more insidious and intractable problem than censorship by outside forces,
    and the battle against this form of censorship may be a harder one to wage. But
    wage it we must if we wish to continue honing our knowledge of the world, and
    thus improving our capacity to make the world a better place for ourselves and
    for future generations.
