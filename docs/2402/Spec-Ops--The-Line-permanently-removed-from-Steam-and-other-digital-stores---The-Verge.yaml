    — it’s the licensing. Video game newshound Wario64 first sounded the alarm on
    social media [that the game had been removed](https://x.com/Wario64/status/1752100767589347450?s=20)

    asking the game’s publisher 2K why this happened. “Makes no sense,” [Davis wrote](https://twitter.com/Snak3Fist/status/1752134538699088153?s=20).
    “Especially because the themes portrayed in [*Spec Ops: The Line*] are more relevant
    now than ever.”'

    several partnership licenses related to the game are expiring. Players who have
    purchased the game can still download and play the game uninterrupted. 2K would
    like to thank our community of players who have supported the game, and we look
    forward to bringing you more offerings from our label throughout this year and

    *The Line*’s menu screen, Jimi Hendrix’s rendition of “The Star Spangled Banner”
    can be heard while the game’s soundtrack includes Martha and The Vandellas’ “Nowhere
    to Run.”
