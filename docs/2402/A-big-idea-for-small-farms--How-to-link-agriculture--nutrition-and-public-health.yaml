    to make that farmers can play an important role in public health nutrition programs.
    At the meeting with about a dozen local farmers, two state representatives, and
    the Colorado commissioner of agriculture, Guttridge will explain how Boulder county
    has made creative investments in his farm that could be scaled up to the state
    or even national level.

    mill about in a field bordered by a simple white fence. The animals, which Guttridge
    raises for wool, munch on radishes that have been leftover for them. And as they
    eat, they poop.

    be out here a couple more weeks, and then it''ll sit for about four or five months.
    And then we''ll just till that in and get our next summer veggies planted right
    there."'

    using grants from the Boulder County Sustainability Office. It allows them to
    move the sheep from one field to another, fertilizing as they go. He's also used
    grants for a farm compost system to fertilize the fields that the sheep don't
    graze on.

    new people, new families," Guttridge says. "We''re trying to make it more of a
    place where people come and get their food, but they also hang out and learn."
    He is hoping the new customers will learn about the values of sustainable farming
    – and how tasty its produce can be.'

    community because they're getting the healthy food, it's good for the farmer,

    on food that's grown locally. Guttridge says that it's a challenge to compete

    people in Boulder and neighboring Longmont go to redeem their fruit and veg coupons.
