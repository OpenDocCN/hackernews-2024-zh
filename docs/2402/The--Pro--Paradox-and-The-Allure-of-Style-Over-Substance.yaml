- en: Leica cameras are revered for their sleek aesthetics and iconic red logo. But
    are they the best choice today for inconspicuous street photography?

- en: When photography pioneers used Leicas, the cameras weighed 200-300g—perfect
    for discreet shooting. Modern Leicas tip the scales at over 700g and cost around
    $10,000\. Hardly inconspicuous under any aspect.

    pricier models. Leica's rangefinder cameras have also forgotten their original
    goals.

- en: Adjusted for inflation, Leica's original cameras would cost about $4,500 today.
    Yet, their latest models tack on a 30% premium for trivial tweaks over the previous
    one. A minor tweak, and it's $9,900 instead of $5,900 (investment firms own Leica,
    licensing the brand from the original company, which now makes microscopes.)

    $1,000\. Fuji and Sony far surpass Leica for autofocus, critical for spontaneous
    street work.

- en: Leicas take beautiful photos, but a heavy status symbol seems at odds with the
    heritage of street shooting candid shots. Like you don't need a Pro phone to be
    a professional at anything except doomscrolling, or like Hemingway didn't write
    his novels with a Mont Blanc, you also don't need a Leica to take great pictures.
    Especially now, especially for street photography.

    watches are pretty, but they rarely keep time better than any $20 Casio.

    brand cachet. You can decide to pay a premium for those, but when does that extra
    cost or status symbol defeat your original goals?
