    airing in the 1990s, a gangster tells Tony, from the titular family, that he wants
    to retire. “What are you, a hockey player?” Tony snaps back. Non-fictional non-criminals
    who are considering an end to their working lives need not worry about broken
    fingers or other bodily harm. But they must still contend with other potentially
    painful losses: of income, purpose or, most poignantly, relevance.'

    executive of his fashion house at the age of 89\. Being Italy’s second-richest
    man has not dampened his work ethic. Charlie Munger, Warren Buffett’s sidekick
    at Berkshire Hathaway, worked for the investment powerhouse until he died late
    last year at the age of 99\. Mr Buffett himself is going strong at 93.
