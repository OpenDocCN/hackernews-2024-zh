- en: Computer enthusiasts have worked out how to reprogram Apple’s iPod music player
    with their own code using an ingenious acoustic trick.

    scrolls through the on-screen menu in order to extract vital information from
    the latest generation of the device. This allowed them to install an alternative
    operating system and make their iPods run games and other new programs.

- en: The project began when Nils Schneider, a 17-year-old computer science student
    from Germany, received an iPod for Christmas. Unlike most new iPod owners, he
    decided to install Linux – a freely available computer operating system not used
    as standard in iPods – on his device.

- en: The existing version of Linux for the iPod would not install easily, however,
    as the latest generation of player features new hardware. Undeterred, Schneider
    decided to figure out how these components worked by himself. He found he could
    control some parts of the device but not those containing details about the way
    the unit starts up, which is vital to getting Linux installed.

    code, Schneider realised that listening to it could provide a shortcut. Bernard
    Leach, a UK software engineer who helped set up the so-called iPod Linux project,
    had already worked out how to control the piezoelectric component within the iPod
    that produces the click.

    up – Schneider decided to use Leach’s system to play the bootloader code as sound.

- en: “I just tried to encode a single byte as a click sound with different spaces
    between the clicks,” Schneider told **New Scientist**. “It seemed to work but
    it was slow so I played around with the code and found out how to make the clicks
    faster.”

    PC programmed to convert it back into computer code. The whole process took more
    than 20 hours and Schneider had to construct a sound proof box for the recording.
    But, in the end, he had extracted the information intact.

    to get iPod Linux booting,” Leach told **New Scientist**. “Otherwise it would
    have taken months.”

- en: Leach explains that the iPod Linux project is partly for fun but also has a
    more serious purpose. “It changes the iPod from a consumer device, where the manufacturer
    sets the rules about what it will and won’t do, into a general purpose device,”
    he says. “Much of the interest has been to develop various games, but things like
    a simple calculator, drawing program and even a GPS/mapping interface are all
    possible.”
