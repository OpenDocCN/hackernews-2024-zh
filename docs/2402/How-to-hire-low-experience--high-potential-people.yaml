    chance to prove myself.

- en: It was particularly hard to take that bet when I was 19-20 and looking for a
    life path. I had no skills to speak of, didn’t understand how to navigate the
    system, and was hopelessly naive. I had applied for hundreds of jobs and didn’t
    get interviews at the vast majority of companies. I had no idea how to prepare
    for interviews or even what kind of path I wanted to follow within the industry.
    But when I applied to the Thiel Fellowship and eventually applied to Stripe, I
    finally found people who wanted to take a bet on my potential. I was given a chance
    to join a team of peers that were similarly green, and found people who ended
    up becoming the bar raisers, confidants, and inspirations for my career ever since.

- en: It might seem insane to take a bet on inexperienced people, especially in the
    context of hiring them to work at a company in our current layoff-heavy market.
    I certainly don’t suggest populating an entire startup with this type of person.
    But every great high growth company (assume a not-yet-public tech startup) needs
    at least some high potential and unconventional people. Transformative companies
    need people to 1) do something crazy, time consuming, and novel without the burden
    of too much past experience and yet 2) have enough wisdom and experience to distinguish
    the special sauce of the business from the actually destructive craziness. It’s
    easier to find and evaluate the experienced folks who can do the latter thing.
    It’s almost impossible to find the right inexperienced ones to do the former,
    who are inventive and original and yet also disciplined. They don’t have any obvious
    past experience that helps you figure out how special they are.

    and firing, and closely imitating the best possible behaviors of my “hiring savant”
    managers, this is what I’ve learned about separating the wheat from the chaff

    visionary.” This set of learnings works especially well for finding people who
    can be those “COOs” — people who are 1-8 years out of school, no specific skills
    (not engineers nor salespeople, yet), who have generalist proclivities. It ignores
    the “status markers” like school brand names and fancy connections that sometimes
    feel like red herrings. And of course, once you get one of these diamonds in the
    rough within your company, get ready to provide them with lots of mentorship –
    they’re truly a lot of work to polish, but the best of them make it all worth
    it.
