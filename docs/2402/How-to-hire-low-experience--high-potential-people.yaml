    life path. I had no skills to speak of, didn’t understand how to navigate the
    system, and was hopelessly naive. I had applied for hundreds of jobs and didn’t
    get interviews at the vast majority of companies. I had no idea how to prepare
    for interviews or even what kind of path I wanted to follow within the industry.
    But when I applied to the Thiel Fellowship and eventually applied to Stripe, I
    finally found people who wanted to take a bet on my potential. I was given a chance
    to join a team of peers that were similarly green, and found people who ended
    up becoming the bar raisers, confidants, and inspirations for my career ever since.

- en: It might seem insane to take a bet on inexperienced people, especially in the
    context of hiring them to work at a company in our current layoff-heavy market.
    I certainly don’t suggest populating an entire startup with this type of person.
    But every great high growth company (assume a not-yet-public tech startup) needs
    at least some high potential and unconventional people. Transformative companies
    need people to 1) do something crazy, time consuming, and novel without the burden
    of too much past experience and yet 2) have enough wisdom and experience to distinguish
    the special sauce of the business from the actually destructive craziness. It’s
    easier to find and evaluate the experienced folks who can do the latter thing.
    It’s almost impossible to find the right inexperienced ones to do the former,
    who are inventive and original and yet also disciplined. They don’t have any obvious
    past experience that helps you figure out how special they are.

  zh: 尤其是在当前裁员严重的市场背景下，赌注于经验不足的人或许看起来有些疯狂。我并不建议将整个初创企业的人员都设定为这种类型。但每个伟大的高增长公司（假设一家尚未公开上市的科技初创公司）至少需要一些高潜力和不寻常的人才。变革性公司需要人们来：1）做一些疯狂、耗时和新颖的事情，而不负担过多的过往经验，同时2）具备足够的智慧和经验，能够区分企业的特别之处与实际上具破坏性的疯狂行为。找到并评估能够做后者的经验丰富的人更容易。而找到合适的、能够做前者的经验不足者，他们富有创造力和原创性，同时又具有纪律性，几乎是不可能的。他们没有任何显而易见的过往经验可以帮助你了解他们有多么特别。

    visionary.” This set of learnings works especially well for finding people who
    can be those “COOs” — people who are 1-8 years out of school, no specific skills
    (not engineers nor salespeople, yet), who have generalist proclivities. It ignores
    the “status markers” like school brand names and fancy connections that sometimes
    feel like red herrings. And of course, once you get one of these diamonds in the
    rough within your company, get ready to provide them with lots of mentorship –
    they’re truly a lot of work to polish, but the best of them make it all worth
    it.
