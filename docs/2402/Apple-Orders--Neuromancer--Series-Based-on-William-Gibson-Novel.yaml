    said Roland and Dillard in a joint statement. “Since we became friends nearly
    ten years ago, we’ve looked for something to team up on, so this collaboration
    marks a dream come true. Neuromancer has inspired so much of the science fiction

- en: “Neuromancer” was Gibson’s debut novel that helped birth the cyberpunk genre.
    It was first published in 1984 and went on to receive a Hugo Award, a Nebula Award,
    and the Philip K. Dick Award. The book led Gibson to publish two follow-ups, “Count
    Zero” and “Mona Lisa Overdrive.” There have been various attempts over the years
    to adapt the book into a film though none have ultimately moved forward.
