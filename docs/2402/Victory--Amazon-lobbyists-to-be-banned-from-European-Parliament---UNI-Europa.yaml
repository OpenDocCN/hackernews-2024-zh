    Member of the European Parliament’s [demand](https://www.uni-europa.org/news/eu-legislators-support-banning-amazon-lobbyists-from-european-parliament/)
    for an Amazon ban from European institutions, the European Parliament will be
    withdrawing Amazon’s lobbying badges. As a result, the company will effectively
    be barred from lobbying inside its premises. This is only the second time in the
    history of the European Parliament, [after Monsanto in 2017](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/sep/28/monsanto-banned-from-european-parliament),
    that a corporation’s lobby access is removed.

    Parliament has drawn a clear red line: Amazon’s anti-democratic behaviour won’t
    be tolerated – whether that’s towards trade unions or parliaments. For Amazon
    workers and their trade unions across Europe, this is an important victory in
    the struggle for good working conditions at Amazon.”*'

    Parliament on working conditions in Amazon warehouses. Amazon is a frequent visitor
    to the EU Parliament. In January alone, it had nine meetings with MEPs, including
    a meeting just a day after the hearing.

    Corporate Europe Observatory, UNI Europa, the ETUC, LobbyControl and SOMO sent
    a [joint letter](https://www.uni-europa.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/02/Amazon-lobby-ban-open-letter-1.pdf)
    to European Parliament President Roberta Metsola, who forwarded the request to
    the College of Quaestors, in support of the removal of Amazon’s badges. The College,
    made up of five Members of the European Parliament, confirmed the decision today
    at a meeting. Now, the Secretary-General of the European Parliament, Alessandro
    Chiocchetti, is set to execute the decision.

    *“Amazon treats our democratic institutions like it treats us, its workers: with
    contempt. Today’s decision by the European Parliament shows Amazon that it can’t
    continue disregarding our democratic institutions without consequences. And I
    hope the same will be true in the future when it comes to our democratic rights:
    like the right to freely join a union and bargain for better conditions and pay.”*'

    antitrust violations, tax dodging and environmental negligence, has drawn sharp
    criticism from advocacy groups worldwide. Just last week, following months of
    intense scrutiny from the press, civil society and government officials, Amazon
    [agreed](https://uniglobalunion.org/news/saudi/) to pay US$1.9 million to reimburse
    more than 700 contracted warehouse workers in Saudi Arabia who were deceived by
    recruitment agents and labour supply companies.
