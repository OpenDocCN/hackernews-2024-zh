- en: Do you always have to wear a watch with the face pointed out? There are good
    reasons to choose a different approach like some soldiers have done for years.
    In this post, we'll explain the various reasons why military personnel wear their
    wristwatches on the inside of their wrists, as well as recommend a watch that
    works perfectly in this position if you're interested in getting one yourself.

- en: Yep, you read that correctly. The first watch was invented to be worn inside
    your wrist instead of on the outside. It's actually a feature that came about
    by somewhat by accident. Remember, the watch started not as a wrist watch, but
    as a pocket watch on a chain. Pocket watches were used as early as the 1500’s.

    by military officers on horseback. The idea was that if your hands were busy holding
    onto reins and steering your horse, you wouldn't have much time to check your
    pocket watch for the time

- en: Breguet designed his new watch so that when it was turned over into position
    on your wrist, its face would be protected from elements like dirt, water and
    sun damage—all things which could affect how accurately it told time. Early watches
    were complex machines and not as durable as today’s watches (particularly Smith
    & Bradley watches). It also meant that if you were wearing gloves or mittens during
    cold weather months, you'd still be able to see what time it was without having
    to remove them first.

    decision that also helped protect the delicate watches in the early days. But
    should you still wear your watch that way today? There are some reasons to consider
    it.

    but it’s common in industries where physical, hard work is done. Construction
    works, manufacturing work and other heavy duty workplaces might require it (or
    suggest it strongly).

    watch, this matters more. But a watch facing inside your wrist will be more protected
    from bumps and bruises over time. You’re less likely to crack the face.
  id: totrans-split-17

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There’s another less obvious protection as well. A watch on the outside of your
    wrist will have the crown facing down (when hands are down). On the inside, the
    crown is protected. This matters when you’re knee deep in water and mud sloshing
    around. The water is less likely to get inside of your watch and mess with the
    movement.

    those that are related to avoiding unnecessary attention. One such rule is “keeping
    your hands away from your face and ensuring that only what’s necessary is exposed.”

- en: Military personnel have a responsibility to ensure they aren't giving their
    enemy any information about themselves or their unit that could be used against
    them. When wearing a watch on the wrist, though, hiding its face can be difficult
    if you're not careful—it's something most people do unconsciously when checking
    the time. A watch face can reflect a glint of sunlight during the day, exposing
    your position, or glow brightly at night. We specifically designed Smith & Bradley
    watches to only lightly glow, so they never give away your position. But most
    watches try to get in too much illumination and it can cause an issue.

    watch from reflection and hides the illumination. It prevents you from accidentally
    exposing your position to the enemy.

    your watch hand is usually holding the rail. Your watch wrist will be pointed
    at your face. As a sniper, you might sit for hours like this. Do you really want
    the watch facing out?

    problem and you’ll have to let go and turn your arm to see the time. It’s not
    ideal. This applied to early watches when holding the reins while riding a horse.
    But you’d be surprised how many situations in life benefit from having the watch
    on the inside of your wrist: anytime you are holding something it’s the inside,
    not the outside of your wrist, that is pointed towards you.'

    as you plan operations. If your watch face is on the outside of your wrist, you
    have to lift your arm and turn it to see the time. This effectively doubles the
    width of your body, increasing your exposure.

    the time. Wearing a watch upside down reduces your personal risk in that situation.

    If you're in uniform, it's easy for others to see that you are part of the armed
    forces. But when out of uniform, wearing your watch upside down can help identify
    you as military to other military personnel. Often civilians won’t realize the
    connection.

    soldiers, special forces and other personnel who need a tactical watch. So we
    originally designed the [SANS-13 Military Watch](https://smithandbradley.com/collections/the-watches/products/sans-13?variant=12530187436117
    "SANS-13 Military Watch") to work inside the wrist. And we used a NATO watch strap
    which was specifically designed for military use.

    it durable even if you choose to wear it outside of your wrist. And its Swiss
    movement makes sure it's accurate when you most need it. It has a 24-hour dial
    again for our military wearers. And we made it water proof and indestructible.
    So we recommend it first for all soldiers, police and others who find themselves
    working in tough environments.
