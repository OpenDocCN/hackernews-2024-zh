    reasons to choose a different approach like some soldiers have done for years.
    In this post, we'll explain the various reasons why military personnel wear their
    wristwatches on the inside of their wrists, as well as recommend a watch that

- en: Yep, you read that correctly. The first watch was invented to be worn inside
    your wrist instead of on the outside. It's actually a feature that came about
    by somewhat by accident. Remember, the watch started not as a wrist watch, but
    as a pocket watch on a chain. Pocket watches were used as early as the 1500’s.

  zh: 是的，你没看错。第一只手表被发明出来是要戴在手腕内侧而不是外侧。这实际上是一种意外中产生的功能。记住，手表最初不是戴在手腕上的，而是挂在链子上的怀表。怀表最早在
    1500 年代就开始使用了。
- en: Then, inventor Louis Breguet created the first wristwatch in 1810 to be worn
    by military officers on horseback. The idea was that if your hands were busy holding
    onto reins and steering your horse, you wouldn't have much time to check your
    pocket watch for the time

  zh: 然后，发明家路易斯·布雷盖特在 1810 年设计了第一块手腕表，供骑马的军官佩戴。这个想法是，如果你的手正忙于握住缰绳和控制马匹，就没时间看口袋里的怀表了
- en: Breguet designed his new watch so that when it was turned over into position
    on your wrist, its face would be protected from elements like dirt, water and
    sun damage—all things which could affect how accurately it told time. Early watches
    were complex machines and not as durable as today’s watches (particularly Smith
    & Bradley watches). It also meant that if you were wearing gloves or mittens during
    cold weather months, you'd still be able to see what time it was without having
    to remove them first.

  zh: 布雷盖特设计了他的新手表，这样当它被翻转到手腕上的位置时，它的表面就会免受脏污、水和阳光的侵害，所有这些都会影响它的时间精度。早期的手表是复杂的机器，没有如今手表（尤其是史密斯和布拉德利手表）那样耐用。这也意味着，如果您在寒冷的天气月份戴着手套或者棉手套，您可以不用先摘下它们就能看到时间。
- en: So wearing the watch with the face on the inside of your wrist was a practical
    decision that also helped protect the delicate watches in the early days. But
    should you still wear your watch that way today? There are some reasons to consider
    it.

- en: As mentioned above, you want to protect a watch. If you’re wearing a non-tactical
    watch, this matters more. But a watch facing inside your wrist will be more protected
    from bumps and bruises over time. You’re less likely to crack the face.

  zh: 正如上面提到的，要保护手表。如果您带的是非战术手表，保护就更为重要。但是手表面向手腕内侧，会更不容易受到时间的损伤。您不太可能让表面破裂。
- en: There’s another less obvious protection as well. A watch on the outside of your
    wrist will have the crown facing down (when hands are down). On the inside, the
    crown is protected. This matters when you’re knee deep in water and mud sloshing
    around. The water is less likely to get inside of your watch and mess with the
    movement.

  zh: 还有另一个不那么明显的保护措施。手腕外侧的手表会使表冠朝向下（手放下时）。而手腕内侧，表冠则受到保护。当你在水和泥浆中深陷时，这一点很重要。水不太可能进入你的手表内部，影响其运行。

  zh: 光学纪律是军事生活规则的术语，特别是那些与避免不必要注意相关的规则。其中一条规则是“远离你的脸，并确保只有必要的东西被暴露”。
- en: Military personnel have a responsibility to ensure they aren't giving their
    enemy any information about themselves or their unit that could be used against
    them. When wearing a watch on the wrist, though, hiding its face can be difficult
    if you're not careful—it's something most people do unconsciously when checking
    the time. A watch face can reflect a glint of sunlight during the day, exposing
    your position, or glow brightly at night. We specifically designed Smith & Bradley
    watches to only lightly glow, so they never give away your position. But most
    watches try to get in too much illumination and it can cause an issue.

  zh: 军人有责任确保他们不会向敌人透露可以被利用的自己或单位的任何信息。但是，戴在手腕上的手表，如果不小心的话，隐藏其表面可能会很困难——大多数人在查看时间时会无意识地做这件事。白天，手表表面可能会反射阳光的光芒，暴露你的位置，或者夜晚可能会发光。我们特别设计了史密斯和布拉德利手表，仅轻微发光，因此永远不会暴露你的位置。但大多数手表尝试增加太多的照明可能会导致问题。

    watch from reflection and hides the illumination. It prevents you from accidentally
    exposing your position to the enemy.
