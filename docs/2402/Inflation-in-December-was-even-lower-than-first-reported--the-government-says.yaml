    as 2023 ended, giving more leeway to the Federal Reserve to start cutting interest
    rates later this year.

    attention this year after the market reacted sharply to last year's changes. Indications
    that inflation in 2022 rose more than anticipated drove Treasury yields higher
    and sparked worry from investors that the Fed might keep monetary policy more
    restrictive.

    the same as originally reported. Fed policymakers tend to focus more on core measures
    as they provide a better indication of long-run movements in inflation.

    stated figures, according to Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.

    — when the revision pushed up the monthly changes in core prices in the final
    few months of last year — the lack of any meaningful change this year, at the
    margin at least, supports an earlier May rate cut," Ashworth added.'

- en: The Fed prioritizes the personal consumption expenditures price index as its
    main inflation gauge. CPI readings feed into the Commerce Department's PCE calculation.
    The difference between the two gauges is essentially that the CPI reflects what
    items cost while the PCE adjusts for what consumers actually buy, accounting for
    changes in behavior when prices rise and fall.
