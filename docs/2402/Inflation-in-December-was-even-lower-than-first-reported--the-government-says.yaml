    originally reported, according to closely watched revisions the government released
    Friday.

    as 2023 ended, giving more leeway to the Federal Reserve to start cutting interest
    rates later this year.

- en: The revisions are done as a matter of course for the BLS, but garnered extra
    attention this year after the market reacted sharply to last year's changes. Indications
    that inflation in 2022 rose more than anticipated drove Treasury yields higher
    and sparked worry from investors that the Fed might keep monetary policy more
    restrictive.

    the same as originally reported. Fed policymakers tend to focus more on core measures
    as they provide a better indication of long-run movements in inflation.

    annualized rate in the fourth quarter, down 0.1 percentage point from the initially
    stated figures, according to Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
    Further out, the second-half revisions put CPI higher — by 0.003 percentage point,
    according to Goldman Sachs calculations.

    economist at Capital Economics, though they could exert some influence on the
    Fed.

    — when the revision pushed up the monthly changes in core prices in the final
    few months of last year — the lack of any meaningful change this year, at the
    margin at least, supports an earlier May rate cut," Ashworth added.'

    main inflation gauge. CPI readings feed into the Commerce Department's PCE calculation.
    The difference between the two gauges is essentially that the CPI reflects what
    items cost while the PCE adjusts for what consumers actually buy, accounting for
    changes in behavior when prices rise and fall.

    rate steady when it next meets in March, then cut in May, to be followed by four
    more quarter percentage point reductions by the end of the year, according to
