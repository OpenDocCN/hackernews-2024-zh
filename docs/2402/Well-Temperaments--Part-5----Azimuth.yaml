    them [last time](https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2024/02/05/well-temperaments-part-4/),
    but now I’ve developed a new method for drawing tuning systems, which should help
    us understand them better.

- en: '[As we’ve seen](https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2024/01/18/well-temperaments-part-2/),
    tuning theory involves two numbers close to 1, called the Pythagorean comma (≈
    1.0136) and the syntonic comma (= 1.0125). While they’re not equal, they’re so
    close that practical musicians often don’t bother to distinguish them! They call
    both a **comma**.'

    this. But that would tend to undercut my claim that the relaxed approach makes
    things simpler! I don’t want to be like the teacher who prefaces the explanation
    of a cute labor-saving trick with a long and confusing theoretical discussion
    of when it’s justified. So let me start by just diving in and *using* this new
    approach.

    that sound really nice, not too sharp, we need some fifths to be flat. Pythagorean

    1 comma. So each fifth is 1/12 of a comma flat.'

    black major thirds, it sounds magnificently sweet. But as soon as you enter the
    fluorescent green region, it sounds wretched! Well temperaments were created to
    smooth this system down… without going all the way to the bland homogeneity of
    equal temperament.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The flatness of the fifths is concentrated in a single fifth, just as in Pythagorean
    tuning. Indeed, from this picture Kirnberger I looks just like a rotated version
    of Pythagorean tuning! That’s a bit deceptive, because in Kirnberger I the flat
    fifth is flat by a syntonic rather than a Pythagorean comma. But this is precisely
    the sort of nuance my new drawing style ignores. And that’s okay, because the
    difference between the syntonic and Pythagorean comma is inaudible.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So the only *noticeable* difference between Kirnberger I and Pythagorean tuning
    is the location of flat fifth. And it’s hard to see any advantage of putting it
    so close to C as Kirnberger did, rather than putting it as far away as possible.

    this system is less ‘extreme’ than Kirnberger I: the pain of sharp major thirds
    is more evenly distributed. As a result, this system was more widely used. But

- en: One of the easiest—and most practical—temperaments to set dates from 1779 and
    is known as Kirnberger III. For a while, some people thought that this might be
    Bach’s temperament, seeing as Johann Philipp Kirnberger (1721–1783) learnt from
    the great JS himself. Despite what you might have been taught, Bach neither invented
    nor used Equal Temperament. He probably used many different tuning systems—and
    if he had one particular one in mind for any of his works, he never chose to write
    clear directions for setting it. Note that his great opus is called the Well-tempered
    Clavier in English, not the “Equal Tempered Clavichord”, as it has too often been
    mistranslated. You will find several other Bach temperaments discussed later in
    this series.
