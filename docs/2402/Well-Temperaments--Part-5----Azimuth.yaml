    them [last time](https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2024/02/05/well-temperaments-part-4/),

    close that practical musicians often don’t bother to distinguish them! They call
    both a **comma**.'

    tuning. Indeed, from this picture Kirnberger I looks just like a rotated version
    of Pythagorean tuning! That’s a bit deceptive, because in Kirnberger I the flat
    fifth is flat by a syntonic rather than a Pythagorean comma. But this is precisely
    the sort of nuance my new drawing style ignores. And that’s okay, because the
    difference between the syntonic and Pythagorean comma is inaudible.

    is known as Kirnberger III. For a while, some people thought that this might be
    Bach’s temperament, seeing as Johann Philipp Kirnberger (1721–1783) learnt from
    the great JS himself. Despite what you might have been taught, Bach neither invented
    nor used Equal Temperament. He probably used many different tuning systems—and
    if he had one particular one in mind for any of his works, he never chose to write
    clear directions for setting it. Note that his great opus is called the Well-tempered
    Clavier in English, not the “Equal Tempered Clavichord”, as it has too often been
    mistranslated. You will find several other Bach temperaments discussed later in
