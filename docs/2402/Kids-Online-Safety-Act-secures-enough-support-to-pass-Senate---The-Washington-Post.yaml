    to expand protections for children online had secured more than 60 backers, clearing

- en: The Kids Online Safety Act, or KOSA, [first introduced in 2022](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2022/02/16/kids-online-safety-act-unveiled-blackburn-blumenthal/?itid=lk_inline_manual_2),
    would impose sweeping new obligations on an array of digital platforms, including
    requiring that companies “exercise reasonable care” to prevent their products
    from endangering kids. The safeguards would extend to their use of design features
    that could exacerbate depression, sexual exploitation, bullying, harassment and
    other harms.
