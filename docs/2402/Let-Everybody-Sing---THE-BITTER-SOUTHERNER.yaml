- en: I told Brownlee about my own upbringing in a different offshoot of the shape-note
    tradition. She replied by telling me that people with truly deep roots in the
    Sacred Harp tradition, like her, referred to the music I grew up with as “new-book
    singing.”

    else.

    that the lead line. Then, the three parts that harmonize with that, usually they
    are written just to harmonize. And they do. With this dispersed music, each line
    is a tune unto itself. It is not written just to harmonize with the lead. It's
    a tune unto itself. That's why they call it dispersed harmony.”

    songs, really, but each with the same words. Which makes it an even more welcoming
    tradition than the one I grew up with. If you don’t like the treble line of a
    song that much, then sing one of the other three. Nobody cares.

    who shot the photographs that accompany this story, told me. “You can just walk
    in, and everyone is on the same level. Everyone is able to stand up and lead a
    song. No one is gonna make fun of you. No one is gonna tell you you're doing it
    wrong, because the whole class will lift you up and sing together and cover your
    mistakes. This, to me, is what heaven should look like.”

    in singing *together*, with others. But most human beings forgo that pleasure
    because they believe they can’t sing a lick. Cruel teenagers tell them, “God,
    you sing so bad. Please shut up!”

    from the get-go to welcome those people, too.
