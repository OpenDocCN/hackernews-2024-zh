    because they know better than you what's on it.

    it and the people who are securing it," he said. "You know the technologies you
    intended to use in that network. We know the technologies that are actually in
    use in that network. Subtle difference. You''d be surprised about the things that
    are running on a network vs. the things that you think are supposed to be there."'

    to do: limit access privileges for important systems to those who really need
    them; segment networks and important data to make it harder for hackers to reach
    your jewels; patch systems and implement application whitelisting; remove hardcoded
    passwords and legacy protocols that transmit passwords in the clear.'

    network activity and produces logs that can record anomalous activity—plus a smart
    system administrator who actually reads the logs and pays attention to what they
    say.

    on [zero-day exploits](https://www.wired.com/2014/11/what-is-a-zero-day/) extensively—unique
    attacks that take advantage of previously unknown software holes to get into systems.
    That's because they don't have to.

    get you in, will achieve that exploitation without the zero days," he says. "There''s
    so many more vectors that are easier, less risky and quite often more productive
    than going down that route." This includes, of course, known vulnerabilities for
    which a patch is available but the owner hasn''t installed it.'

    Kaspersky Lab's Global Research and Analysis Team, asked about the issue of attribution
    and efforts by some attack groups to manipulate and alter indicators of compromise
    to thwart attribution or point the finger at someone else.

    "So if the government is saying that we have positive attribution too, you ought
    to book it. Attribution is really really hard, so when the government''s saying
    it, we''re using the totality of the sources and methods we have to help inform
    that. [But] because those advanced persistent threats aren''t going away, ...
    we can''t bring all that information to the fore and be fully transparent about
    everything we know and how we know it."'
