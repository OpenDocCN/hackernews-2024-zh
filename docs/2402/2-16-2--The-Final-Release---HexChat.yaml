    unmaintained for years now and nobody else stepped up to do that work.

- en: I want to say thank you to all of the contributors, users, and chatters I’ve
    interacted with over the years. HexChat was a very important and formative project
    for me; I started contributing to it as a teenager, learned so much, met many
    great people, and it led to greater things in my life. It is hard to let go but
    the time has come for me to move on.

    installers, and dependencies will be there until the end of Microsoft.
