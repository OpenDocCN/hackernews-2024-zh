    Becker believed that when companies have a big profit cushion — whether from a
    natural monopoly, government support, or whatever — they have the latitude to
    indulge the personal biases of their managers. In the 1970s, that largely meant
    discriminating against Black and female employees. At Google in the 2020s, it
    means creating AI apps that refuse to draw White people in Hitler’s army. The
    theory predicts that only the ruthless pressure of market competition will force
    companies to stop discriminating. There’s actually [some empirical evidence](https://www.chicagobooth.edu/review/how-gary-becker-saw-the-scourge-of-discrimination)

    forgotten that this sort of discrimination is against the law. Or perhaps they
    thought White employees would simply feel that it’s unseemly to sue over discrimination.

- en: Discrimination against White employees in companies and universities is another
    kind of *shortcut*. It’s an attempt to circumvent the hard work of changing attitudes
    and prosecuting companies for discriminating against people of color, and instead
    simply leap to a solution by implementing discrimination in the opposite direction.

- en: But it won’t work. In addition to the legal obstacles, it seems likely that
    the companies engaging in “antiracist discrimination” started out as the *least*
    racist companies, and thus were the ones in the lowest need for intervention in
    the first place. There are definitely still plenty of organizations out there
    that [discriminate against nonwhite people](https://www.wbur.org/hereandnow/2021/08/18/name-discrimination-jobs),
    but these are unlikely to be the ones who adopt anti-White discrimination in an
    attempt to compensate. Instead, each company or organization will simply have
    its own list of favored and disfavored races. This is why Kendi is wrong; racism
    and antiracism don’t cancel each other out like matter and antimatter.

  zh: 但这并不起作用。除了法律障碍外，那些从事“反种族主义歧视”的公司似乎起初是*最*不种族主义的公司，因此首先根本不需要干预。确实还有许多组织在那里[歧视非白人](https://www.wbur.org/hereandnow/2021/08/18/name-discrimination-jobs)，但这些组织不太可能采取反白人歧视以进行补偿。相反，每个公司或组织都会有自己偏爱和不喜欢的种族清单。这就是肯迪错了；种族主义和反种族主义不像物质和反物质一样互相抵消。
- en: So “antiracist discrimination” looks to some like a shortcut to a multiracial
    society, but it isn’t. Instead, it’s likely to have the opposite effect — pushing
    more White people into a bitter, defensive embrace of White racial identity in
    reaction to having their careers stymied. That will have a negative impact on
    the shared national identity that America needs in order to increase social trust
    and provide public goods. Academics may be able to convince themselves of a definition
    of the word “racism” in which institutionalized discrimination against White people
    can never be “racist”, but the general public [has not yet been convinced](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/washington-secrets/84379/its-ok-to-be-white-agree-72-including-53-of-black-people/#google_vignette)
    of this definition, and is unlikely to ever be convinced.
