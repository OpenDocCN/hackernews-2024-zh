    Becker believed that when companies have a big profit cushion — whether from a
    natural monopoly, government support, or whatever — they have the latitude to
    indulge the personal biases of their managers. In the 1970s, that largely meant
    discriminating against Black and female employees. At Google in the 2020s, it
    means creating AI apps that refuse to draw White people in Hitler’s army. The
    theory predicts that only the ruthless pressure of market competition will force
    companies to stop discriminating. There’s actually [some empirical evidence](https://www.chicagobooth.edu/review/how-gary-becker-saw-the-scourge-of-discrimination)

    it can afford to goof around in the AI space without suffering real consequences
