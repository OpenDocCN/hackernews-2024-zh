- en: Nine states inked an agreement today to promote heat pump sales. The memorandum
    of understanding (MOU) sets a 2030 target for heat pumps to make up 65 of residential
    heating, cooling, and water heating equipment sales. By 2040, the goal is for
    heat pumps to account for 90 percent of the HVAC and water heating market.

    to traditional heating *and* cooling systems. And because they’re electric, they
    can feasibly run on renewables like wind and solar once there’s more clean energy
    coursing through power grids. The states on board with the agreement include:
    California, Colorado, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Oregon,
    and Rhode Island.'

    clear-cut plan for now. The states will have to develop their own policies or
    incentives to deploy all these heat pumps. But it shows how much hype there is
    around heat pumps in the fight against climate change. And with national climate
    policies hanging in the balance during upcoming presidential elections, state-led
    efforts become more crucial.

    shared target that states are collectively moving in this direction,” says Emily

    (NESCAUM). The nonprofit association of air quality agencies spearheaded the effort
    to adopt an MOU.
