    haven’t worked well in subzero temperatures. But heat-pump manufacturers say they
    now have the technology to heat homes just as efficiently in bitter cold as they
    do in milder winter temperatures.

    [Cold-Climate Heat Pump Technology Challenge](https://www.energy.gov/eere/buildings/residential-cold-climate-heat-pump-challenge),
    hosted by the U.S. Department of Energy in partnership with Natural Resources
    Canada. The companies’ task is to demonstrate a high-efficiency, residential air-source
    heat pump that can perform at 100 percent capacity at -15 °C. Companies can choose
    to further test their machines down to -26 °C.

- en: 'Advances in the technology came primarily through improvements in one key heat-pump
    component: the compressor. Heat pumps [work](https://spectrum.ieee.org/heat-pumps-explained)
    by moving and compressing fluids. In the winter, the systems draw heat from outside
    the home, most commonly from the air. (There is heat in the air even in subzero
    temperatures.) An outdoor heat exchanger, or coil, absorbs the heat into the heat-pump
    system.'
  id: totrans-split-12
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The outdoor air passes over a heat exchanger containing a fluid, or refrigerant,
    that has a very low boiling point. A common refrigerant, called R410a, boils at
    -48.5 °C. The refrigerant boils and evaporates into a vapor, and a compressor
    increases its temperature and pressure. The superheated vapor then moves through
    an indoor coil, where fans blow air across it, moving heat into the home. In the
    summer, the system reverses, moving heat from inside the building to the outside,
    and cooling the home.

- en: The colder the temperature outside, the harder heat pumps must work to extract
    and move enough heat to maintain the home’s temperature. At about 4 °C, most air-source
    heat pumps currently on the market start operating at less than their full capacity,
    and at some point (usually around -15 °C), they can no longer do the job at all.
    At that point, an auxiliary heat source kicks on, which is less efficient.

    that issue. By controlling the compressor motor’s speed, and improving the timing
    of when vapor is injected into the compressor, engineers have made heat pumps
    more efficient in colder temperatures.

    headquartered in Dublin, “played with the vapor compression cycle” so that it
    gets an extra injection of refrigerant, says Katie Davis, vice president of engineering
    and technology in Trane’s residential business. “It’s works a little like fuel
    injection,” she says. When the system begins to lose its capacity to heat, the
    system injects refrigerant to give it a boost, she says.

    100 percent capacity at -15 °C and kept running even as the lab’s temperature
    dropped to -30 °C, although no longer at full capacity. “They couldn’t get the
    lab any colder than that, so we had to cut the power to get the heat pump to turn
    off,” Davis says.

    had not been optimized for heat pumps, Davis says. That, plus the introduction
    of smart systems that enable the indoor and outdoor units to communicate with
    each other and the thermostat, has enabled heat pumps to take on colder weather.

    of heat pumps because of their potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Such
    systems run on electricity rather than fossil fuels, and when the electricity
    comes from renewable sources, [the greenhouse gas savings are substantial](https://www.energy.gov/eere/buildings/articles/residential-cold-climate-heat-pump-technology-challenge-fact-sheet),

    published 12 February in the journal *Joule* supports the DOE’s claim. The study
    found that if every heated home in the United States switched to a heat pump,
    home energy use would drop by 31 to 47 percent on average, and national carbon
    dioxide emissions would fall by 5 to 9 percent, depending on how much electricity
    is provided by renewable energy. Those figures are based on heat pumps that draw
    heat from an air source (rather than ground or water) and includes both homes
    that pull heat through ductwork, and homes that are ductless.

    on the efficiency and cold-climate performance of the heat pump being installed.
    How well a home is insulated and the type of heating system being replaced also
    makes a big difference in energy bills, the study found. For households that are
    currently heating with electric resistance heat, fuel oil, or propane, heat pumps
    could save thousands of dollars annually. For natural gas, the savings are less
    and depend on the price of natural gas in the local area.
