    demanded, another team is wanting to reuse this part of the UI. “Happy to” she
    responded, knowing that there was no getting out of this work. ‘Tis much better
    to build this well and share it around than have many implementations of the same
    thing with very small differences between them. None of which quite solving the
    problem. Loading up a [Riot Grrrl](https://music.apple.com/au/playlist/riot-grrrl-essentials/pl.4ac9566eba234d99971cface91950c1c)
    playlist in Apple Music, she pulled down the latest version of the codebase and
    began to work. The code she found wasn’t the best. If it were, she wouldn’t be
    doing this task now would she? She had seen this kind of code many times before.
    A few different components wrapped up in what would colloquially be described
    as a card. There was a [VStack](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/vstack)
    with the different bits and pieces stuck in there along with a fairly standard
    set of [view modifiers](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/viewmodifier).

    很明显，最好是将这个建设良好并共享给其他人，而不是有许多实现相同事物的不同实现，其中之间的差异非常小。 这些都不太解决问题。 在 Apple Music 中加载一张

    content arbitrary while maintaining style and functionality. This will give her
    the best base component to allow others to build upon.

    established way of applying a common set of modifications to a view. The girls
    team has experience with this and she knows there will be little cognitive overhead
    for them to pick up the preferred way of doing this. So how would this look to
    her teammates? This is always an important question to ask and so she opened up
    a [Swift Playground](https://developer.apple.com/swift-playgrounds/) (We all remember
    those things right? More than just for WWDC scholarship applications) and started
    roughing out what it would be.

    a break and spend time contemplating next steps. She knew that this would solve
    a problem, but would it encourage the team to use it and have an understanding
    of what is being accomplished? She gazed at her Swift Playground a bit more, but
    was not satisfied she could answer that question in the affirmative. One approach
    down, on to the next one.

    that the view itself was being displayed as a card. But she knew, even this didn’t
    have what she was looking for. It was a single change to an existing View in the
    app but it lacked discoverability and had a high cognitive overhead on her colleagues.
    She didn’t want to make life more difficult for her friends that she interacted
    with ever day. Well, there was one who was super annoying but what work environment
    doesn’t have people like that in them. The girl shuddered and as she was still
    holding her tea for warmth in both hands took a calming sip of tea. Thankfully,
    she knew of a solution and where she wanted to go with this bit of work.

    speaking with others in the industry. She had to be super careful in this as the
    environments could very easily be toxic. She was there to learn more about what
    she loved doing day to day. A repeated theme amongst conversations is how Swift
    as a language allows for the writing of DSL’s and this was a super powerful technique
    to use when writing apps with SwiftUI. She had heard of the idea about [result
    builders](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-language/advancedoperators/#Result-Builders)
    and their specific application in SwiftUI being [@ViewBuilder](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/viewbuilder).
    Needing a refresher before continuing, she queued up a few WWDC videos on the
    topics being [Write a DSL in Swift using result builders](https://developer.apple.com/wwdc21/10253)
    and [Embrace Swift generics](https://developer.apple.com/wwdc22/110352) that deal
    with the topic. She couldn’t help but be excited that both presenters in the videos
    were female. With how much progress had been made in recent years, there was still
    a long way to go towards gender equality.

    were to start adopting a similar approach in how they wrote views, she would need
    to give them as much help as possible. This was more than just chatting with other
