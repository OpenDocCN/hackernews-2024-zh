    demanded, another team is wanting to reuse this part of the UI. “Happy to” she
    responded, knowing that there was no getting out of this work. ‘Tis much better
    to build this well and share it around than have many implementations of the same
    thing with very small differences between them. None of which quite solving the
    problem. Loading up a [Riot Grrrl](https://music.apple.com/au/playlist/riot-grrrl-essentials/pl.4ac9566eba234d99971cface91950c1c)
    playlist in Apple Music, she pulled down the latest version of the codebase and
    began to work. The code she found wasn’t the best. If it were, she wouldn’t be
    doing this task now would she? She had seen this kind of code many times before.
    A few different components wrapped up in what would colloquially be described
    as a card. There was a [VStack](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/vstack)
    with the different bits and pieces stuck in there along with a fairly standard
    set of [view modifiers](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/viewmodifier).

    would be to rename the existing view, expose properties for things like title,
    image, text and throw it into a shared part of the project. But she knows well
    and true that will only cause pain down the track. She needs a way to make the
    content arbitrary while maintaining style and functionality. This will give her
    the best base component to allow others to build upon.

- en: View modifiers have been around since the start of SwiftUI and have been a long
    established way of applying a common set of modifications to a view. The girls
    team has experience with this and she knows there will be little cognitive overhead
    for them to pick up the preferred way of doing this. So how would this look to
    her teammates? This is always an important question to ask and so she opened up
    a [Swift Playground](https://developer.apple.com/swift-playgrounds/) (We all remember
    those things right? More than just for WWDC scholarship applications) and started
    roughing out what it would be.

    tucked under her in a posture that confounds her colleagues and sipped on the
    tea she had recently poured for herself. A miracle that she remembered to take
    a break and spend time contemplating next steps. She knew that this would solve
    a problem, but would it encourage the team to use it and have an understanding
    of what is being accomplished? She gazed at her Swift Playground a bit more, but
    was not satisfied she could answer that question in the affirmative. One approach
    down, on to the next one.

    that the view itself was being displayed as a card. But she knew, even this didn’t
    have what she was looking for. It was a single change to an existing View in the
    app but it lacked discoverability and had a high cognitive overhead on her colleagues.
    She didn’t want to make life more difficult for her friends that she interacted
    with ever day. Well, there was one who was super annoying but what work environment
    doesn’t have people like that in them. The girl shuddered and as she was still
    holding her tea for warmth in both hands took a calming sip of tea. Thankfully,
    she knew of a solution and where she wanted to go with this bit of work.

  zh: 这使她有了自由将其应用于任何视图类型，并且使得人们能够理解视图本身被显示为卡片。但她知道，即使这样也不是她所追求的。这只是对应用程序中现有视图的单一更改，但缺乏可发现性，并且对她的同事有很高的认知负担。她不想让自己每天与之互动的朋友的生活变得更加困难。好吧，有一个人真的很烦人，但哪个工作环境没有这样的人呢。女孩打了个寒颤，因为她仍然双手握着茶杯取暖，轻轻地喝了一口茶。谢天谢地，她知道了解决方案，也知道她想要在这项工作中走向何方。

- en: Each year the girl spent a good amount of her time travelling the world and
    speaking with others in the industry. She had to be super careful in this as the
    environments could very easily be toxic. She was there to learn more about what
    she loved doing day to day. A repeated theme amongst conversations is how Swift
    as a language allows for the writing of DSL’s and this was a super powerful technique
    to use when writing apps with SwiftUI. She had heard of the idea about [result
    builders](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-language/advancedoperators/#Result-Builders)
    and their specific application in SwiftUI being [@ViewBuilder](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/viewbuilder).
    Needing a refresher before continuing, she queued up a few WWDC videos on the
    topics being [Write a DSL in Swift using result builders](https://developer.apple.com/wwdc21/10253)
    and [Embrace Swift generics](https://developer.apple.com/wwdc22/110352) that deal
    with the topic. She couldn’t help but be excited that both presenters in the videos
    were female. With how much progress had been made in recent years, there was still
    a long way to go towards gender equality.

    was to bring her team onboard with the approach. She could slap together a PR
    and send it up for others to review, but that wouldn’t achieve much. If others
    were to start adopting a similar approach in how they wrote views, she would need
    to give them as much help as possible. This was more than just chatting with other
    engineers. Now it was time for a checklist. She still had a lot of work to do
    to ensure adoption by others.
