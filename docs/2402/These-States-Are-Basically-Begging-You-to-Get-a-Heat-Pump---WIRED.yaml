    [heat pump](https://www.wired.com/story/why-you-the-planet-need-heat-pump/). They’re
    already [outselling gas furnaces in the US,](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/heat-pumps/chart-americans-bought-more-heat-pumps-than-gas-furnaces-last-year)
    and now a coalition of states has signed an agreement to supercharge the gas-to-electric
    transition by making it as cheap and easy as possible for their residents to switch.

- en: Nine states have signed a memorandum of understanding that says that [heat pumps](https://www.wired.com/tag/heat-pumps/)
    should make up at least 65 percent of residential heating, air conditioning, and
    water-heating shipments by 2030\. (“Shipments” here means systems manufactured,
    a proxy for how many are actually sold.) By 2040, these states—California, Colorado,
    Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, and Rhode Island—are
    aiming for 90 percent of those shipments to be heat pumps.

    this transition to zero-emissions residential buildings,” says Emily Levin, senior
    policy adviser at the Northeast States for Coordinated Air Use Management (NESCAUM),
    an association of air-quality agencies, which facilitated the agreement. The states
    will collaborate, for instance, in pursuing federal funding, developing standards
    for the rollout of heat pumps, and laying out an overarching plan “with priority
    actions to support widespread electrification of residential buildings.”

- en: Instead of burning planet-warming natural gas, a heat pump warms a building
    by transferring heat from the outdoor air into the interior space. Run it in the
    opposite direction, and it can cool the inside of a building—a heat pump is both
    a heater and AC unit. Because the system is electric, it can run off a grid increasingly
    powered by renewables like wind and solar. Even if you have to run a heat pump
    with electricity from fossil-fuel power plants, it’s much more efficient than
    a furnace, because it’s moving heat instead of creating it.

    to one estimate](https://carbonswitch.com/heat-pump-carbon-reduction-and-savings-potential-report/).
    They’ve gotten so efficient that even when it’s freezing out, [they can still
    extract warmth](https://www.greenbiz.com/article/cost-effective-new-study-confirms-heat-pump-efficiency-freezing-temperatures)
    from the air to heat a home. You can even install a heat pump system that also
    [warms your water](https://www.energy.gov/energysaver/heat-pump-water-heaters).
    “We really need consumers to move away from dirty to clean heat, and we really
    want to get the message out that heat pumps are really the way to go,” says Serena
    McIlwain, Maryland’s secretary of the environment. “We have homeowners who are
    getting ready to replace their furnaces, and if they're not aware, they are not
    going to replace it with a heat pump.”

- en: The coalition’s announcement comes just months after the federal government
    doubled down on its own commitment to heat pumps, [announcing $169 million in
    funding](https://www.wired.com/story/you-need-a-heat-pump-soon-youll-have-more-american-made-options/)
    for the domestic production of the systems. That money comes from 2022’s Inflation
    Reduction Act, which also provides an American household with [thousands of dollars
    in rebates or tax credits](https://www.wired.com/story/how-inflation-reduction-act-climate-bill-save-you-money/)
    to switch to a heat pump.

- en: These states are aiming to further collaborate with those heat pump manufacturers
    by tracking sales and overall progress, sending a signal to the industry to ramp
    up production to meet the ensuing demand. They'll also collaborate with each other
    on research and generally share information, working toward the best strategies
    for realizing the transition from gas to electric. Basically, they’re pursuing
    a sort of standardization of the policies and regulations for getting more heat
    pumps built, bought, and installed, which other states outside of the coalition
    might eventually tap into.
