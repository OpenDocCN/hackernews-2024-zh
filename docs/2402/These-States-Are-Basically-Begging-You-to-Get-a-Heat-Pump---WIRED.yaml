    transition by making it as cheap and easy as possible for their residents to switch.

    should make up at least 65 percent of residential heating, air conditioning, and
    water-heating shipments by 2030\. (“Shipments” here means systems manufactured,
    a proxy for how many are actually sold.) By 2040, these states—California, Colorado,
    Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, and Rhode Island—are
    aiming for 90 percent of those shipments to be heat pumps.

- en: “It’s a really strong signal from states that they’re committed to accelerating
    this transition to zero-emissions residential buildings,” says Emily Levin, senior
    policy adviser at the Northeast States for Coordinated Air Use Management (NESCAUM),
    an association of air-quality agencies, which facilitated the agreement. The states
    will collaborate, for instance, in pursuing federal funding, developing standards
    for the rollout of heat pumps, and laying out an overarching plan “with priority
    actions to support widespread electrification of residential buildings.”

    Levin）说道。该协会是空气质量机构的一个联合体，促成了此协议。例如，各州将合作争取联邦资金，制定热泵推广的标准，并制定一个全面计划，“优先行动以支持住宅建筑物的广泛电气化。”
- en: Instead of burning planet-warming natural gas, a heat pump warms a building
    by transferring heat from the outdoor air into the interior space. Run it in the
    opposite direction, and it can cool the inside of a building—a heat pump is both
    a heater and AC unit. Because the system is electric, it can run off a grid increasingly
    powered by renewables like wind and solar. Even if you have to run a heat pump
    with electricity from fossil-fuel power plants, it’s much more efficient than
    a furnace, because it’s moving heat instead of creating it.

  zh: 不再燃烧会导致地球变暖的天然气，热泵通过将室外空气中的热量传递到室内空间来加热建筑物。反过来运行，它可以冷却建筑物内部——热泵既是加热器又是空调单位。由于系统是电动的，它可以通过越来越多由风力和太阳能等可再生能源供电的电网运行。即使您必须使用来自化石燃料发电厂的电来运行热泵，它比炉子效率要高得多，因为它移动热量而不是产生热量。

    “We really need consumers to move away from dirty to clean heat, and we really
    want to get the message out that heat pumps are really the way to go,” says Serena
    McIlwain, Maryland’s secretary of the environment. “We have homeowners who are

    going to replace it with a heat pump.”

    up production to meet the ensuing demand. They'll also collaborate with each other
