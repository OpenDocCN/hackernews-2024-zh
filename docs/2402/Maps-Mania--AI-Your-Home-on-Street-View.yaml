- en: Have you ever wanted to radically alter the ambiance of your neighborhood? Perhaps
    you've always dreamed of turning your sleepy suburban road into a bustling inner-city
    street. Or maybe you've always wanted to dig up your nearby traffic heavy roads
    and replace them with green fields and trees. Well now you can - at least virtually.

    you to grab Google Maps Street View panoramas from any location in the world and
    change their appearance based on your own AI prompts. For example the animated
    GIF above shows my childhood home re-imagined as a Vincent van Gogh painting,
    as a sc-fi landscape, a post-zombie apocalypse and under 3 feet of water.'

    of the world are not able to live in cycle-friendly environments. Therefore the
    Netherlands Board of Tourism decided to help the great car-worshiping unwashed
    picture the beauty of a car free environment. Enter your address into the Dutch
    Cycling Lifestyle and you can see how your street might look without that noisy
    road and those dirty cars.

    View image of your street - only in this case to make it a little more Dutch.
    The result is an imagined view of your road, looking a little greener and probably
    a lot more attractive.

- en: Wait! There is even more fun to be had with Google Maps Street View. Thanks
    to [**Street Galleries**](https://artsandculture.google.com/experiment/gQEd3RNgW2oxDg),
    you can also create your own virtual outdoors art gallery with Street View. Street
    Galleries is a Google Arts & Culture project which allows you to decorate cities
    around the world on Google Maps Street View with works of art from some of the
    world's leading museums.

    Once you have chosen a location, you can begin adding paintings to the Street
    View of that location. Pick a painting from the Google Arts & Culture digital
    collections and you can hang it anywhere within your Street View panorama. You
    can move the painting around in the Street View, allowing you to hang the picture
    on a building, on the road or even just leave it hanging in mid-air.
