    claiming that its "ultra-hard stainless steel" body and "transparent metal" glass
    were "literally bulletproof."

    with anything Tesla and Musk-related – attracted legions of devotees eager to
    get their hands on the steering wheel.

    A trending thread titled "[Rust Spots/Corrosion is the Norm](https://www.cybertruckownersclub.com/forum/threads/rust-spots-corrosion-is-the-norm.11988/)"

    it''s not stainless steel." This is a common misconception. Stainless steel is
    resistant to rust, but not completely immune.'

    price went from $40,000 in 2019 to $60,000 in 2023, we understand why owners might
    want their cars to appear pristine at all times.

    another user, vertigo3pc, reported that "corrosion was forming on the metal" of
    his brand-new Cybertruck after 11 days in the "LA rain," leading some to worry
    that the steel body was becoming contaminated during production.

    steel" doesn't require much care. Tesla, it appears, would vehemently disagree.

    documentation](https://www.cybertruckownersclub.com/forum/threads/cybertruck-corrosion-per-owner-manual.11445/),
    where it is said that the car does not have a clear coat. In more typical cars,
    clear coat is the outermost layer of transparent paint that serves as a protective
    barrier, preventing UV radiation and weather from damaging the colored paint layer.
    Clear coat also takes abrasions that might otherwise scratch the paint job.

  zh: 今年1月的另一个帖子包含了一个[Cybertruck维护文档的截图](https://www.cybertruckownersclub.com/forum/threads/cybertruck-corrosion-per-owner-manual.11445/)，文档中提到这款车没有清漆。在更典型的汽车中，清漆是透明涂层的最外层，作为保护屏障，防止紫外线和恶劣天气损坏彩色涂层。清漆还能承受可能会划伤油漆的磨损。
- en: 'The user warns: "The Cybertruck''s exterior is susceptible to corrosion, as
    acknowledged in the manual. Once the oxide barrier is compromised, corrosion initiates.
    The manual advises prompt removal of corrosive substances, emphasizing not to
    wait until the Cybertruck is scheduled for a full wash."'

    corrosive substances (such as grease, oil, bird droppings, tree resin, dead insects,
    tar spots, road salt, industrial fallout, etc.). Do not wait until Cybertruck
    is due for a complete wash. If necessary use denatured alcohol to remove tar spots
    and stubborn grease stains, then immediately wash the area with water and a mild,
    non-detergent soap to remove the alcohol."'

- en: 'It sounds like a lot of work if even a five-minute dash for milk might result
    in a midge besmirching the body. Tesla explicitly states: "The stainless steel
    exterior of Cybertruck is more resistant to dents and dings than most other vehicles.
    However, Cybertruck does not have a clear coat on the surface of the exterior
    body panels, meaning any scratches that appear are in the stainless steel panels
    themselves."'
