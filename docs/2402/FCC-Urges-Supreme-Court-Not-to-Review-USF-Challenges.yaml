- en: WASHINGTON, May 8, 2024 – The Federal Communications Commission urged the Supreme
    Court not to weigh in on a conservative nonprofit’s challenge to the agency’s
    Universal Service Fund, an $8-billion annual program to subsidize rural broadband
    infrastructure and internet bills for low-income households, schools and libraries,
    and healthcare providers.

    FCC’s Universal Service Administrative Company responsible for collecting and
    distributing the money based on contribution factors set each quarter by the commission.

    those contribution factors in court, alleging in multiple federal appellate courts
    that the fund is unconstitutional. The group argues that Congress did not put
    proper guardrails on the FCC’s authority to collect the fund and that the commission
    abused what authority it does have by delegating the responsibility to USAC.

    and [Eleventh Circuit](https://broadbandbreakfast.com/eleventh-circuit-rules-in-favor-of-usf-constitutionality/)
    both rejected those arguments on similar grounds, finding that Section 254 of
    the Telecommunications Act of 1996, which sets out the FCC’s USF responsibilities,
    is in line with statutes that have survived similar challenges in the past and
    that the agency exercises enough oversight of USAC that it still functionally
    controls the fund.

    after they came down. The Fifth Circuit, which originally also sided with the
    FCC, agreed in July 2023 to rehear the case with a full panel of judges, and the
    group argued in a January filing that the notoriously conservative circuit was
    likely to reverse course and create conflicting precedent. Oral arguments in that
    case happened in September and a decision has not yet been issued.

    of any circuit conflict counsels in favor of denying the petitions for writs of

    254 satisfy the nondelegation doctrine, a legal standard which requires Congress

    to refrain from applying the major questions doctrine in this case. The Supreme
