- en: Last year was a big one for [the right-to-repair movement](/2023/5/28/23738770/right-to-repair-updates-laws),
    with [California and other states](/23910066/right-to-repair-law-newsom-california-sb-244)
    passing laws that promised consumers they can fix their own stuff — or take that
    stuff to a third-party repair shop without breaking their warranty or their gadgets.
    This year, [more states](/2024/1/11/24034706/google-supports-oregons-right-to-repair-bill)
    are considering laws to the same effect, and the tech industry appears to be more
    behind the effort than ever. (Some companies appear to be only begrudgingly behind
    it, but it’s a win for the movement nonetheless.)

    to hear a lot of optimism and then two scary-sounding words: *parts pairing*.
    Those words, and what they mean for your ability to actually fix your stuff, are
    what might be holding back a true repair revolution.'

    the current right-to-repair moment, looking at bills in Oregon and elsewhere while
    trying to figure out what the new laws actually mean for repair shops around the
    US. We also explain why parts pairing exists — why companies are digitally attaching
    parts to one another so that you can’t just attach one iPhone screen to another
    iPhone — and whether it’s a problem or a solution.

    — and why the actual news was just the tip of the future-of-gaming iceberg. Finally,
    we answer a question from the *Vergecast* hotline (866-VERGE11, or email vergecast@theverge.com!)
    about whether the streaming industry’s password crackdown is really going to work.
