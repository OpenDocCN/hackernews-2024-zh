- en: The misconception
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For several years already, my StackOverflow profile has consistently ranked
    in the top 1%, having now several tens of thousands of points.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When people see my score, they often assume that I spend hours going through
    random questions and providing answers. However, this is a complete misconception.
    In reality, I rarely engage in such activities (although I greatly appreciate
    those who do).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: All I’ve been doing so far is simply being an ***active user*** instead of a
    passive one. Which is something that in my opinion all programmers should do.

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There is no doubt that Stack Overflow is extremely popular, if not essential,
    for all developers. Yet, after many years of close interaction with fellow programmers
    in various environments — companies, universities, and open-source communities
    — I’ve observed that the vast majority of developers tend to use this platform
    rather passively.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Most users simply copy and paste solutions from Stack Overflow without even
    creating an account. Among those who do have a registered account, only a few
    actively engage with the platform.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Unlike the majority of developers, I consider myself an active user of this
    platform, integrating it into my routine problem-solving workflow. I primarily
    interact with Stack Overflow when dealing with my own technical problems, but
    I do so by actively engaging with the platform.
  prefs: []

    I’ll explain my simple yet effective approach.

    common. These could range from fixing errors to implementing algorithms and various
    other technical challenges.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Since I believe in avoiding reinventing the wheel, whenever I encounter problems
    for which the fix is not obvious to me (or I simply do not remember the exact
    solution), I look up the issue on the web, hoping to find a solution on Stack
    Overflow.

    for opening good questions on Stack Overflow goes beyond the scope of this article.

    solution again.'
