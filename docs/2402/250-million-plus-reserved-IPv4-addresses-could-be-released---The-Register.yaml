    IPv4 addresses from 240.0.0.0 to 255.255.255.254 – a space that encompasses upwards
    of 268 million addresses, or about six percent of the entire IPv4 number space.

    Wilson and his co-authors proposed re-classifying 240/4 so it could be used for
    private networks. There are already some IP ranges reserved for that purpose,
    namely 10/8, 172.16/12, and 192.168/16\. In the 2008 draft, Wilson and colleagues
    suggested 240/4 could be added to those pools to help “large private Internets
    that require more address space than is available in the private use address space
    designated by [RFC1918] during the dual stack transition to IPv6.”

    of home routers, most of which won’t recognize 240/4 or would need new firmware
    to do so. If the block were freed for public use, some of its IP addresses could
    therefore be invisible to many users. Workarounds are possible, but many internetworking
    wonks are already a bit ashamed at the prevalence of network address translation!

- en: Australian network engineers Karl Kloppenborg and Christopher Hawker are also
    calling for change to the status of 240/4 due to IPv4 exhaustion. The pair point
    out that APNIC currently allocates those who apply for IPv4 addresses a /23 block
    - just 512 IPv4 addresses - when it has some to hand out (usually when unused
    addresses are returned to the registry for re-use). Kloppenborg and Hawker believe
    that if APNIC were given just three of the 16 /8 blocks from 240/4, the registry
    could satisfy demand for new IPv4 allocations for 20 years or more under current
    allocation policies.
