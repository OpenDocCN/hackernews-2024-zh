    to be released for use, potentially tackling the IPv4 exhaustion problem. However,
    the proposal has been tried and failed before, and again faces formidable opposition.
  prefs: []

- en: The unused addresses are known as the “240/4” block and comprise most of the
    IPv4 addresses from 240.0.0.0 to 255.255.255.254 – a space that encompasses upwards
    of 268 million addresses, or about six percent of the entire IPv4 number space.
    For some perspective on the magnitude, at market rates, the addresses are worth
    around $7 *billion*

    aside for future use or experiments.

    evolution. Consider, for example, that 16 million IP addresses were allocated
    to ham radio operators, and the protection of 240/4 for future use.
  prefs: []

    radio operators recently made more than $100 million by selling some of their
    IPv4 assets to Amazon – an extraordinary windfall and one that rankles given that
    the world all-but-exhausted its supply of fresh IPv4 addresses over a decade ago.

    at modest cost.

    of regional internet registry (RIR) the Asia-Pacific Network Information Centre
    (APNIC).

- en: In a 2008 IETF [draft](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-wilson-class-e-02)
    Wilson and his co-authors proposed re-classifying 240/4 so it could be used for
    private networks. There are already some IP ranges reserved for that purpose,
    namely 10/8, 172.16/12, and 192.168/16\. In the 2008 draft, Wilson and colleagues
    suggested 240/4 could be added to those pools to help “large private Internets
    that require more address space than is available in the private use address space
    designated by [RFC1918] during the dual stack transition to IPv6.”

    came from those who felt it would take a decade or more to implement.

    240/4 and simply won’t process packets sent to the millions of addresses the block
    contains. Doing so makes sense: why confuse users by letting them access addresses
    that aren’t connected to the public internet?'

    for use - especially on public networks. To understand why, consider the billions
    of home routers, most of which won’t recognize 240/4 or would need new firmware
    to do so. If the block were freed for public use, some of its IP addresses could
    therefore be invisible to many users. Workarounds are possible, but many internetworking
    wonks are already a bit ashamed at the prevalence of network address translation!

    to the plan has come from those who use the old argument about the need to replace
    or upgrade potentially billions of devices to ensure universal access to 240/4,
    citing the cost, risks, and potential ecological impact of upgrading the world’s
    networking device fleet. Others have argued against it on grounds that freeing
    IPv4 addresses will further retard migration to IPv6, a protocol with a practically
    infinite number space and many fine features that IPv4 lacks.

    it would be a significant barrier to its release.'

- en: Australian network engineers Karl Kloppenborg and Christopher Hawker are also
    calling for change to the status of 240/4 due to IPv4 exhaustion. The pair point
    out that APNIC currently allocates those who apply for IPv4 addresses a /23 block
    - just 512 IPv4 addresses - when it has some to hand out (usually when unused
    addresses are returned to the registry for re-use). Kloppenborg and Hawker believe
    that if APNIC were given just three of the 16 /8 blocks from 240/4, the registry
    could satisfy demand for new IPv4 allocations for 20 years or more under current
    allocation policies.

    developing nations where telcos may not be ready for IPv6, and skills and equipment
    are scarce, to enjoy the benefits of greater competition as local companies use
    IPv4 resources to offer services.
