- en: Adaptive Cards are platform-agnostic snippets of UI, authored in JSON, that
    apps and services can openly exchange. When delivered to a specific app, the JSON
    is transformed into native UI that automatically adapts to its surroundings. It
    helps design and integrate light-weight UI for all major platforms and frameworks.
