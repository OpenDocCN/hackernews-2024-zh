- en: As part of the normal stable release process, kernel changes that are potentially
    security issues are identified by the developers responsible for CVE number assignments
    and have CVE numbers automatically assigned to them. These assignments are published
    on the linux-cve mailing list as announcements on a frequent basis.

- en: Note, due to the layer at which the Linux kernel is in a system, almost any
    bug might be exploitable to compromise the security of the kernel, but the possibility
    of exploitation is often not evident when the bug is fixed. Because of this, the
    CVE assignment team are overly cautious and assign CVE numbers to any bugfix that
    they identify. This explains the seemingly large number of CVEs that are issued
    by the Linux kernel team.
