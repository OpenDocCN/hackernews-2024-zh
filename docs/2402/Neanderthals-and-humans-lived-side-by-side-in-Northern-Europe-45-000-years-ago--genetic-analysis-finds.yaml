- en: A genetic analysis of bone fragments unearthed at an archaeological site in
    central Germany shows conclusively that modern humans—Homo sapiens—had already
    reached Northern Europe 45,000 years ago, overlapping with Neanderthals for several
    thousand years before the latter went extinct.
  prefs: []

- en: The findings establish that the site near Ranis, Germany, which is known for
    its finely flaked, leaf-shaped stone tool blades, is among the oldest confirmed
    sites of modern human Stone Age culture in north central and northwestern Europe.
  prefs: []

- en: The evidence that Homo sapiens and Homo neanderthalensis lived side by side
    is consistent with genomic evidence that the two species occasionally interbred.
    It also feeds the suspicion that the invasion of Europe and Asia by modern humans
    some 50,000 years ago helped drive Neanderthals, which had occupied the area for
    more than 500,000 years, to extinction.

    tools](https://phys.org/tags/stone+tools/) found at several sites in Moravia,
    Poland, Germany and the United Kingdom. These tools that are thought to have been
    produced by the same culture, referred to as the Lincombian–Ranisian–Jerzmanowician
    (LRJ) culture or technocomplex. Because of previous dating, the Ranis site was
    known to be 40,000 years old or older, but without recognizable bones to indicate
    who made the tools, it was unclear whether they were the product of Neanderthals
    or Homo sapiens.

    Homo sapiens were this far north at this time period, which is 45,000 years ago,"

    Research Fellow at the University of California, Berkeley. "So these are among

    of hominid bone fragments from the new and deeper excavations at Ranis between
    2016 and 2022 and from earlier excavations in the 1930s. Because the DNA in ancient
    bones is highly fragmented, she employed special techniques to isolate and sequence
    the DNA, all of it mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) that is inherited solely from the
    mother.

    from human remains at other paleolithic sites in Europe, Zavala was able to construct
    a family tree of early Homo sapiens across Europe. All but one of the 13 Ranis
    fragments were quite similar to one another and, surprisingly, resembled mtDNA
    from the 43,000-year-old skull of a woman discovered in a cave at Zlatý kůň in
    the Czech Republic. The lone standout grouped with an individual from Italy.

    excavated mainly between 1932 and 1938\. The leaf points found there were eventually
    assigned to the final years of the Middle Paleolithic period—between about 300,000
    and 30,000 years ago—or the beginning of the Upper Paleolithic, which began around
    50,000 years ago.

- en: Because of the importance of the Ranis site for understanding the LRJ technocomplex
    and the transition from the Neanderthal-associated late Middle Paleolithic to
    the modern human Upper Paleolithic in central Europe, Hublin and his team decided
    to re-excavate the site using modern tools of archaeology.
