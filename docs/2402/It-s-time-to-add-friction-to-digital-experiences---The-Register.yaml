    robbed.

    helped themselves to it, and escaped.

    A combination of poor password hygiene and weak security on his Windows laptop
    gave the intruders unfettered access to the digital wallets in which he stored
    cryptocurrency. By the time my friend knew he'd been robbed, the thieves had likely
    “washed” the coins using sophisticated cryptographic tools that made those coins
    – if not quite anonymous – very difficult to trace.

    best. Sometimes that works – but sometimes that mobile's SIM has been [cloned](https://www.theregister.com/2009/07/10/comic_book_sim/)
    and it's all for naught. Speed bumps provide the illusion of safety and security,
    without actually doing much to slow the escape vehicle. To do that requires a
    bit more of a rethink.

    per second, megahertz and the like. (Twenty-four years ago, at the famed Game
    Developers Conference, I remember seeing the very first AMD Athlon [running at
    1GHz](https://www.theregister.com/2000/03/03/how_amd_beat_intel/) – and thought
    it a wonder.)

    load, store, move, add, subtract, test, jump – over the systemic product of those
    operations – such as moving data between machines (and owners) across a network.
    Our relentless optimization for speed has us [valuing a 120Gbit/sec](https://www.theregister.com/2022/10/19/intel_nextgen_thunderbolt/)
    Thunderbolt port over a more thoughtful consideration of how we might be far better
    served by an operation more complex, secure – and slower. Thinking fast has left
    us vulnerable.

    can't be fast, then what's the point?

- en: Perhaps the point should not be which chip or algorithm renders the fastest
    or most accurate operation, but which systemic approach offers the greatest level
    of safety and security. Systems that have no friction in them – running unsupervised,
    without speed bumps, with no skeptical humans in the loop judging and grading
    – are hurtling down the highway to hell. That we also happen to be *in* these
    vehicles seems to occur to no one – until after the inevitable crash.

    to consider how we might make all of our key IT infrastructure “slow”.

- en: 'Some criteria appear immediately obvious: friction should be proportionate
    to the danger inherent in the transaction. A private message between two close
    confidantes needs very little friction. On the other hand, a massive financial
    transaction or data migration could include baked-in “breakpoints” that require
    human intervention before automated work continues. Making those big and dangerous
    transactions slow and expensive, studded with human oversight, makes them less
    likely to suddenly spiral out of control.'

    “slow television”. “Slow computing” could provide the safety belt, airbags and
    crumple zones needed to keep us from becoming digital roadkill. Speed can be useful,
    but physics tells us that the damage of a crash increases with the square of the
    velocity. We need to hit the brakes – before we hit the wall. ®
