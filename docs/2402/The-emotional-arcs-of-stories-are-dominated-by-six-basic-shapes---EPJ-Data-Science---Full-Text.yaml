    12 modes in both the weighted (dark) and un-weighted (lighter) representation.
    In total, the first 12 modes explain 80% and 94% of the variance from the mean
    centered and raw time series, respectively. The modes are from mean-centered emotional
    arcs, such that the first SVD mode need not extract the average from the labMT
    scores nor the positivity bias present in language [[28](/articles/10.1140/epjds/s13688-016-0093-1#ref-CR28

    USA 112(8):2389-2394     ")]. The coefficients for each mode within a single emotional
    arc are both positive and negative, so we need to consider both the modes and
    their negation. We can immediately recognize the familiar shapes of core emotional
    arcs in the first four modes, and compositions of these emotional arcs in modes
    5 and 6\. We observe ‘Rags to riches’ (mode 1, positive), ‘Tragedy’ or ‘Riches
    to rags’ (mode 1, negative), Vonnegut’s ‘Man in a hole’ (mode 2, positive), ‘Icarus’
    (mode 2, negative), ‘Cinderella’ (mode 3, positive), ‘Oedipus’ (mode 3, negative).
    We choose to include modes 7-12 only for completeness, as these high frequency
    modes have little contribution to variance and do not align with core emotional
    arc archetypes from other methods (more below).

    be either positive and negative, such that the modes themselves explain variance
    with both the positive and negative version. In the right panels of each mode
    in Figure [3](/articles/10.1140/epjds/s13688-016-0093-1#Fig3) we project the 1,327
    stories onto each of first six modes and show the resulting coefficients. While
    none are far from 0 (as would be expected), mode 1 has a mean slightly above 0
    and both modes 3 and 4 have means slightly below 0\. To sort the books by their
    coefficient for each mode, we normalize the coefficients within each book in the
    rows of *W* to sum to 1, accounting for books with higher total energy, and these
    are the coefficients shown in the right panels of each mode in Figure [3](/articles/10.1140/epjds/s13688-016-0093-1#Fig3).

    positive and negative modes, and the stories closest to each by sorting on the
    coefficient for that mode. For the positive stories, we sort in ascending order,
    and *vice versa*. Mode 1, which encompasses both the ‘Rags to riches’ and ‘Tragedy’
    emotional arcs, captures 30% of the variance of the entire space. We examine the
    closest stories to both sides of modes 1-3, and direct the reader to Figure S8

    from the ‘Rags to riches’ mode are *The Winter’s Tale* (1,539) and *Oscar Wilde*,
    *Art and Morality*: *A Defence of* ‘*The Picture of Dorian Gray*’ (33,689). Among
    the most categorical tragedies we find *Lady Susan* (946) and *Warlord of Kor*
    (17,958). Number 8 in the sorted list of tragedies is perhaps the most famous
    tragedy: *Romeo and Juliet* by William Shakespeare. Mode 2 is the ‘Man in a hole’
    emotional arc, and we find the stories which most closely follow this path to
    be *The Magic of Oz* (419) and *Children of the Frost* (10,736). The negation
    of mode 2 most closely resembles the emotional arc of the ‘Icarus’ narrative.
    For this emotional arc, the most characteristic stories are *Shadowings* (34,215)
    and *Battle-Pieces and Aspects of the War* (12,384). Mode 3 is the ‘Cinderella’
    emotional arc, and includes *Mystery of the Hasty Arrow* (17,763) and *Through
    the Magic Dorr* (5,317). The negation of Mode 3, which we refer to as ‘Oedipus’,
    is found most characteristically in *This World is Taboo* (18,172), *Old Indian
    Days* (339), and *The Evil Guest* (10,377). We also note that the spread of the
    stories from their core mode increases strongly for the higher modes.'

    that these specific arcs are uniquely compelling as stories written by and for
    *homo narrativus*, we consider the true emotional arcs in relation to their most
    suitable comparison: the book with randomly shuffled words (‘word salad’) and
    the resulting text from a 2-gram Markov model trained on the individual book itself
    (‘nonsense’). We chose to compare to ‘word salad’ and ‘nonsense’ versions as they
    are more representative of a null model: written stories that are without coherent
    plot or structure to generate a coherent emotional arc, which is not true of a
    stochastic process (*e.g.*, a random walk model or noise). Examples of the emotional
    arc and null emotional arcs for a single book are shown in Figure S20 in Additional
    file [1](/articles/10.1140/epjds/s13688-016-0093-1#MOESM1), with 10 ‘word salad’
    and ‘nonsense’ versions. Sampled text using each method is given in Appendix C
    in Additional file [1](/articles/10.1140/epjds/s13688-016-0093-1#MOESM1). We re-run
    each method on the English fiction Gutenberg Corpus with the null versions of
    each book and verify that the emotional arcs of real stories are not simply an
    artifact. The singular value spectrum from the SVD is flatter, with higher-frequency
    modes appearing more quickly, and in total representing 45% of the total variance
    present in real stories (see Figures S22 and S25 in Additional file [1](/articles/10.1140/epjds/s13688-016-0093-1#MOESM1)).
    Hierarchical clustering generates less distinct clusters with considerably lower
    linkage cost (final linkage cost 1,400 vs 7,000) for the emotional arcs from nonsense
    books, and the winning node vectors on a self-organizing map lack coherent structure

    mode (for additional modes, see Figure S3 in Appendix B in Additional file [1](/articles/10.1140/epjds/s13688-016-0093-1#MOESM1)).
    We find that the first four modes, which contain the greatest total number of
    books, are not the most popular. Along with the negative of mode 2, both polarities
    of modes 3 and 4 have markedly higher median downloads, while we discount the
    importance of the mean with the high variance. The success of the stories underlying
    these emotional arcs suggests that the emotional experience of readers strongly
    affects how stories are shared. We find ‘Icarus’ (-SV 2), ‘Oedipus’ (-SV 3), and
    two sequential ‘Man in a hole’ arcs (SV 4), are the three most successful emotional
    arcs. These results are influenced by individual books within each mode which
