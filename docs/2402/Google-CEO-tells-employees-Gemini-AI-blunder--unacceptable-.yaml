    in the Gemini app (formerly Bard). I know that some of its responses have offended
    our users and shown bias – to be clear, that's completely unacceptable and we
    got it wrong.

    we know the bar is high for us and we will keep at it for however long it takes.
    And we'll review what happened and make sure we fix it at scale.

    and technical announcements we've made in AI over the last several weeks. That
    includes some foundational advances in our underlying models e.g. our 1 million
    long-context window breakthrough and our open models, both of which have been
    well received.
