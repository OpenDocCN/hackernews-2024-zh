    Near [bragged](https://themarkup.org/privacy/2021/09/30/theres-a-multibillion-dollar-market-for-your-phones-location-data)
    that it was “The World’s Largest Dataset of People’s Behavior in the Real-World,”
    with data representing “1.6B people across 44 countries.” Last year the company
    [went public](https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/data-intelligence-firm-near-go-public-via-1-billion-spac-deal-2022-05-19/)
    with a valuation of $1 billion (via a [SPAC](https://hbr.org/2021/07/spacs-what-you-need-to-know)).
    Seven months later it filed for bankruptcy and has agreed to sell the company.

    sensitive locations such as abortion clinics, being sold off in bankruptcy has
    raised alarms in Congress. Last week, Sen. Ron Wyden [wrote the Federal Trade
    Commission](https://www.wyden.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/signed_near_letter_to_ftc_and_sec.pdf)
    (FTC) urging the agency to “protect consumers and investors from the outrageous
    conduct” of Near, citing his office’s investigation into the India-based company.

    to ensure that all location and device data held by Near about Americans is promptly
    destroyed and is not sold off, including to another data broker.” The FTC took
    [such an action in 2010](https://www.ftc.gov/sites/default/files/documents/public_statements/use-sale-or-transfer-personal-information-obtained-xy-magazine-and-xy.com-during-its-bankruptcy-proceeding/100712xy.pdf)
    to block the use of 11 years worth of subscriber personal data during the bankruptcy
    proceedings of the XY Magazine, which was oriented to young gay men. The agency
    requested that the data be destroyed to prevent its misuse.

    that Near had licensed location data to the anti-abortion group Veritas Society
    so it could target ads to visitors of Planned Parenthood clinics and attempt to
    dissuade women from seeking abortions. Wyden’s investigation revealed that the
    group’s geofencing campaign focused on [600 Planned Parenthood clinics](https://www.politico.com/news/2024/02/13/planned-parenthood-location-track-abortion-ads-00141172#:~:text=A%20company%20allegedly%20tracked%20people's,exceeds%20what%20was%20previously%20known.)

    such as reproductive health care facilities, doctor’s offices, houses of worship,
