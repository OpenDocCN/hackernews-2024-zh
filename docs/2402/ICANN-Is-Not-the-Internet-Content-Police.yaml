    registered domain name holder cease the illegal activity, and suspend the domain
    name if the website operator or registered domain name holder does not cease the

    there are clear-cut boundaries between ICANN enforcing its contracts and the enforcement
    of laws and regulations by the institutions mentioned earlier. A blanket rule
    requiring suspension of any domain name alleged to be involved in illegal activity
    goes beyond ICANN's remit and would inevitably put ICANN in the position of interpreting
    and enforcing laws regulating website content. At worst, it would put ICANN squarely
    in the position of censoring, or requiring others to censor, Internet content.

    court of whether it is an appropriate and proportionate remedy for the alleged
    violation of law, or whether a less onerous remedy would sufficiently address
    the violation. It is neither reasonable nor appropriate for ICANN to bypass the
    institutions that are charged with making these determinations and to impose unilaterally
    a remedy that might or might not be available through the judicial system, particularly
    where ICANN has no direct contractual relationship with the impacted domain name
