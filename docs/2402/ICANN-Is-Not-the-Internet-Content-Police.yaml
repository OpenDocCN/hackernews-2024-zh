- en: Allow me to say this clearly and succinctly – ICANN is not a global regulator
    of Internet content, nor should the 2013 Registry Accreditation Agreement (RAA)
    be interpreted in such a way as to put us in that role. Our mission is to coordinate,
    at the overall level, the global Internet's systems of unique identifiers, and
    in particular, to ensure the stable and secure operation of the Internet's unique
    identifiers. ICANN was never granted, nor was it ever intended that ICANN be granted,
    the authority to act as a regulator of Internet content.

    interpreting and enforcing laws and regulations around the world. These institutions,
    including law enforcement (local and national police agencies as well as intergovernmental
    organizations like Interpol), regulatory agencies and judicial systems, have the
    expertise, experience and legitimacy to police illegal activity and to address
    difficult questions such as jurisdiction and conflicts of law. In most countries,
    these institutions also offer procedural due process and mechanisms for appeal
    and are experienced in addressing difficult issues such as the proportionality
    of remedies. If content is to be policed, the burden is on these institutions,
    and not ICANN, to undertake such regulation.

    responsibility for policing illegal activity on the Internet. Specifically, some
    maintain that if a website sponsored by a signatory to the 2013 RAA is engaged
    in illegal activity, ICANN should require that registrar to determine whether
    the website is engaged in illegal activity, demand that the website operator or
    registered domain name holder cease the illegal activity, and suspend the domain
    name if the website operator or registered domain name holder does not cease the
    illegal activity, effectively putting the website out of business. If the registrar
    refuses to suspend the domain name, some further maintain that ICANN should terminate
    the registrar's accreditation under the 2013 Registrar Accreditation Agreement,
    effectively putting the registrar out of business.

    informingthe community about efforts I am making to offer greater clarity regarding
    ICANN's interpretation and enforcement of certain key provisions of the 2013 RAA.
    Since ICANN 52, I have held discussions with members of the Registrar Stakeholder
    Group, representatives of the IPC and intellectual property owners, members of
    civil society, various parties that have submitted abuse reports under the 2013
    RAA and other interested parties, to solicit their views on these matters. Perhaps
    not surprisingly, the views expressed by various stakeholders within the ICANN
    community regarding interpretation of the 2013 RAA are wide-ranging and divergent.
     I hope the outcome of these discussions will be for ICANN to provide greater
    clarity on how we interpret and enforce key provisions of the 2013 RAA.

    there are clear-cut boundaries between ICANN enforcing its contracts and the enforcement
    of laws and regulations by the institutions mentioned earlier. A blanket rule
    requiring suspension of any domain name alleged to be involved in illegal activity
    goes beyond ICANN's remit and would inevitably put ICANN in the position of interpreting
    and enforcing laws regulating website content. At worst, it would put ICANN squarely
    in the position of censoring, or requiring others to censor, Internet content.

    various countries. To be clear, I am not trying to single out, criticize or disparage
    laws enacted by any particular government. ICANN is a multinational community
    with diverse stakeholders, and we always need to be mindful of differences among
    our community members. ICANN and the ICANN community have great respect for cultural,
    religious and political diversity and recognize that the values of one country
    or religion may not be shared with another.

    derogatory statements about public officials online, or incite dissatisfaction
    with the government via Internet posts. In the light of mass public protests that
    have brought down or destabilized governments in recent years, many countries
    have enacted legislation prohibiting the use of websites and social media to organize
    "unlawful" demonstrations and street protests.

- en: The simple fact is that many laws in effect in numerous countries render content
    itself illegal. However the 2013 RAA is interpreted, it cannot mean that ICANN
    is responsible for making factual and legal determinations as to whether content
    violates the law. ICANN cannot be put in the position of requiring suspension
    of domain names on the basis of allegations of blasphemy, hate speech, holocaust
    denial, political organizing, full or partial nudity or a host of other content
    that may be illegal somewhere in the world.  That would be inconsistent with ICANN's
    mission, ICANN's limited remit and ICANN's responsibility to operate in accordance
    with a consensus-driven multistakeholder model.

    I am suggesting that ICANN needs to remain within the scope of its limited responsibilities,
    remit and authority, and not step outside those boundaries. ICANN's mission and
    mandate, as set forth in its bylaws, is "to coordinate, at the overall level,
    the global Internet's systems of unique identifiers, and in particular, to ensure
    the stable and secure operation of the Internet's unique identifiers." ICANN's
    mission statement sets forth a limited remit that is largely technical in nature.
    It says nothing about ICANN being empowered to act as a global regulator of content
    and illegal activity throughout the world.

    the institutions that have the legitimacy and authority to decide whether the
    content in fact violates the law, and to impose appropriate remedies, are local
    law enforcement, regulators, prosecutors and courts, not ICANN. No one has vested
    in ICANN the authority to act as judge and jury, to make factual and legal determinations
    and to impose remedies for violations of laws or regulations in every country
    around the world. ICANN does not have the authority, expertise or resources to
    do so.

    issues. Consider website content, such as pornography or banned political speech,
    that may violate content laws in Country X. If the domain name holder is located
    in Country A, the website operator in Country J and the web hosting company in
    Country Z, all of them may assert that they are not subject to the laws of Country
    X and not subject to the jurisdiction of its courts. Judicial systems are the
    institutions equipped to deal with these difficult issues, not ICANN.

- en: Note, also, that the suspension of a domain name is tantamount to injunctive
    relief and may put a website operator out of business. Legal systems in many countries
    consider this an extraordinary remedy that would only be imposed after an adversarial
    hearing, procedural and substantive due process, and cautious assessment by the
    court of whether it is an appropriate and proportionate remedy for the alleged
    violation of law, or whether a less onerous remedy would sufficiently address
    the violation. It is neither reasonable nor appropriate for ICANN to bypass the
    institutions that are charged with making these determinations and to impose unilaterally
    a remedy that might or might not be available through the judicial system, particularly
    where ICANN has no direct contractual relationship with the impacted domain name
    registrant or website operator.

    them. Neither ICANN nor registrars have any ability to edit or remove content
    from websites. It is simply unrealistic to place the worldwide burden of policing
    illegal content on websites on ICANN.

    Some in the ICANN community contend that a distinction should be made where laws
    are not directed purely at regulating content per se, but at other illegal activities
    that are engaged in by a website operator. Some in the community advocate that
    illegal activities that pose a substantial and imminent threat to safety, health
    or human life be treated differently than other classes of illegal activities.
    Others in the community assert that there are areas of the law relating to illegal
    activity on websites that are sufficiently uniform throughout the world that they
    should be treated differently, for example, where the law in virtually every country
    recognizes the activity in question to be illegal and there is international consensus
    reflected in multinational treaties. In practice, many in the Internet community
    treat certain illegal activities such as child pornography or human trafficking
    in a class by themselves.
