    by the contraction of its outsized real estate sector - perhaps better described
    as an urbanization-engine. Viewed from this point of view, it turns a pattern
    of unsustainable ultra-rapid growth in an environmentally friendly direction.
    That is good for the planet but makes it no more sustainable in macroeconomic
    terms. This may be true but it also poses the question of how relevant equilibrium
    considerations are in light of the climate emergency. If China is hurling resources
    into accelerating the energy transition should we not be applauding, profiting
    from and, indeed, emulating their example? Clearly this cannot mean duplicating
    what they are already doing. If they have stolen a huge and insurmountable lead
    in PV and batteries we have only ourselves to blame. They will also pay the cost
    in terms of overcapacity. Let us by their cheap kit and invest our scarce resources
    in the many other areas that demand attention. This will be the subject of another
    carbon note.

    recorded above. Together with spending on EV, charging infrastructure, railways

    far been driven by household and consumer focuses spending. This might be thought

    the clean energy transition in China to date, is somewhat deceptive. In China,
    an energy transition that addresses household and local energy needs through distributed
    solar and reduces oil consumption in passenger transport is a step in the right
    direction. But we should not confuse China’s economic structure with that in the
    West. In China, if the energy transition does not extend to the industrial core,
    it cannot substantially mitigate the pollution problem. And, on that front, the
    news to date is less encouraging.

    largest increases in energy demand took place in the iron and steel, and chemical

    new coal projects in 2022? The turning point were concerns over electricity shortages
    in the autumn of 2021 and summer of 2022 which led to a policy reversal. The focus
    of energy policy has since shifted from discouraging and controlling new coal
    power projects to pushing for acceleration, with the regulators setting 85 a target
    in September 2022 to sharply accelerate construction starts, and pushing 86 profitable
    coal mining firms to invest in coal power generation. … Between January 2022 and
    June 2023, China permitted 152 gigawatts (GW) and started construction on 92 GW
    of new coal power capacity. This is eight times the amount of capacity entering
    construction, and more than ten times the capacity permitted, in the rest of the
    world during the same period. Another 25 GW, at least, was permitted in China

    a huge increase in coal-fired generating capacity for which there will be inadequate
    demand. Stranded assets create vested interests that will resist the energy transition
    in the heavy industrial core of the Chinese economy. For the global energy transition,
    the internal struggle within China over the future of the coal-based heavy industrial
    model, is a question as important if not more than that over the future of fracked
    oil and gas in the United States, or Russia’s destiny as an oil and gas exporter.
    These are the giant dominos that must tumble if we are to move rapidly along the
    path to decarbonization. Will the CCP regime have the courage to administer the
    kind of shock therapy that transformed the Chinese economy notably in the late
    1990s? How will it deal with the politico-economic fallout? In terms of internal
    distributional consequences these questions dwarf anything faced by governments
    in the West.
