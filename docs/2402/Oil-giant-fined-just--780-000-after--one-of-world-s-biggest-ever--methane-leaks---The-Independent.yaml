    field in southwestern Kazakhstan during drilling at an exploration well in 2023.

    of methane in history, with concentrations exceeding permissible levels by 480
    times, findings from the ecology department of the Mangystau regional government

    said while the amount of the fine the company is liable to pay is highly inadequate,
    holding it responsible for the leak is a “cause for celebration”.

    Independent*, adding that it is “nothing compared to” the $900 per metric tonne
    of methane levy imposed on major emitters by the Biden administration as part
    of its landmark Inflation Reduction Act, which aims to reduce carbon and methane
    pollution.

    analysis](https://eartharxiv.org/repository/view/6709/) by research teams from
    France, Spain, and the Netherlands showed approximately 127,000 tonnes of the
    dangerous gas was released during the leak, surpassing the emissions from all
    previously reported accidents. The BBC first [reported](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-68166298)
    the findings as part of its investigation.
