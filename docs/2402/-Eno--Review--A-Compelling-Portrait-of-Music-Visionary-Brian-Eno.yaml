- en: 'Even next to David Bowie, with his alien regalia and mutating persona, it was
    [Brian Eno](https://variety.com/t/brian-eno/) who always seemed like the supreme
    spaceman of the pop-music universe. In 1972, when he first came onto the scene
    as the 24-year-old synthesizer wizard of Roxy Music, he sported a look that was
    pure glam, except that he somehow appeared even more baroque than the gender-bending
    rock stars of the time (the New York Dolls, Bowie, Lou Reed). They were Dionysian
    pansexual strutters, whereas Eno was his own unique thing: a delicate sci-fi gamine,
    a geek in thrift-shop drag. He wore light blue eye shadow and pinkish lipstick
    and jackets with huge shoulder pads that sprouted shiny black feathers, but his
    hair was thinning on top and long and wispy on the sides, and his pout gave him
    the look of a passionflower extraterrestrial.'

  zh: 甚至相对于戴维·鲍伊，带着他alien外表和多变的人格，[布莱恩 · 伊诺](https://variety.com/t/brian-eno/) 似乎总是像流行音乐世界的至尊太空人。1972年，当他首次以Roxy
    Music的24岁的合成器魔法师的身份出现时，他的外观纯粹是魅力四射，除了他在那个时候看起来更加的巴洛克式，超越了性别弯曲摇滚明星（纽约玩偶，鲍伊，卢·里德）。他们是狂躁的性感摇滚者，而恩诺是他自己独特的存在：一个精致的科幻少女，一个在二手店装扮的极客。他涂着浅蓝色眼影和粉红唇膏，穿着大肩膀垫上长着闪亮黑色羽毛的外套，但他的头发顶部变得稀薄，两侧又长又蓬松，他的噘嘴给了他宛如热带蔷薇的外星人的形象。
- en: As Eno began to create his solo albums of “ambient music” (a form he more or
    less invented, though it’s now so pervasive it’s almost hard to hear how out of
    the box it was then), he held onto his image as pop’s surreal harlequin eccentric.
    And even in 1976, when he cut his hair, ditched the glam threads, and began to
    collaborate with Bowie on what would come to be known as the Berlin Trilogy (“Low,”
    “Heroes,” “Lodger”), establishing his singular flair as a record producer, Eno
    still had the aura of an exotic mad scientist.

  zh: 当恩诺开始制作他的“环境音乐”个人专辑时（这种形式他几乎是发明了，虽然现在它已经如此普遍，几乎很难听到当时的开创性），他仍然保持着流行乐的超现实丑角怪异形象。甚至在1976年，当他剪掉了他的头发，摆脱了华丽的装束，并开始与鲍伊合作，他剪出了被称为柏林三部曲的作品（“Low,”
    “Heroes,” “Lodger”），建立起他作为音乐制作人的独特魅力时，恩诺仍然具有异域 疯狂科学家的光环。
- en: Part of it was his name. At the time, he was always referred to simply as “Eno,”
    which sounded vaguely interplanetary. Yet part of it was the mystique with which
    he created those records — and the ones he would go on to make with Talking Heads,
    Devo, U2, and Coldplay. Most fabled producers had a signature sound, but Eno’s
    production was all about what he coaxed out of the artists and what he pared away.
    He favored music rooted in repetition that was minimal yet majestic, propulsive
    in a holistic way. He wanted to leave the listener ecstatically spaced-out.

  zh: 其中一部分原因是他的名字。当时，他总是被简单地称为“Eno”，听起来有点太空般。但部分原因是他对这些唱片制作的神秘感 —— 以及他将与Talking Heads,
    Devo, U2 and Coldplay继续合作的唱片。大部分乐队制作人都有一个标志性的声音，但恩诺的制作都是关于他从艺术家那里赶出来的东西和他剔除掉的部分。他偏爱根植于重复之中的音乐，这是一种简约而宏伟的方式，是一种全面的推进。他想要让听众感到无比舒畅，同时也让人感到空灵。
- en: “Eno,” the portrait of Brian Eno that opened the [Sundance Film Festival](https://variety.com/t/sundance-film-festival/)
    today, is a documentary that mirrors the spirit of Eno’s music in its very form.
    The director, Gary Hustwit (“Helvetica”), created it with generative software
    that allows the film to play in a different version every time you see it. Sections
    of it will land in a different order, and some won’t appear at all (replaced by
    others); the movie is reshuffled each time with an element of the random. How
    random? Well, it’s not as if the generative AI determines the order of *everything*.
    I’ve seen “Eno” just once, so I can’t compare it to other iterations of the film,
    but what I saw felt like it played in a sensible and, to a degree, predetermined
    order. The individual sequences are carefully edited, and if Hustwit, in putting
    forth this experiment, had tried to suggest that complete random assemblage-by-AI
    is the future, he might be getting threats from the Motion Picture Editors Guild.

  zh: “Eno,”今天在[Sundance Film Festival](https://variety.com/t/sundance-film-festival/)上映的布莱恩·伊诺肖像是一部纪录片，它在形式上与伊诺音乐的精神相映成趣。导演加里·哈斯特威特（《Helvetica》）使用生成软件创作了这部电影，这使得电影每次观看都以不同的版本呈现。它的部分内容将以不同的顺序出现，有些部分甚至可能根本不会出现（被其他替代）；每次电影都以随机因素重排。有多随机？那么，生成式人工智能并不决定*一切*的顺序。我只看过一次“Eno”，所以无法把它与电影的其他版本进行比较，但我所看到的感觉是它以合理且在一定程度上是预定的顺序播放。各个场景经过精心编辑，如果哈斯特威特在提出这个实验时试图暗示完全随机的人工智能组合是未来的方向，他可能会受到电影剪辑工会的威胁。
- en: As a documentary, “Eno” is sleek, seamless, and compelling, though one of the
    reasons it feels that way is that Hustwit, drawing on 500 hours of film and video
    from Eno’s personal archives, has made a movie that’s *all* Brian Eno. On the
    issue of talking heads, this film has virtually none, save for Eno himself, who
    talks all the way through it. The documentary uses his observations to fuse his
    past and present, his evolving images and shifting roles, in a way that accentuates
    their musical and spiritual continuity.

  zh: 作为一部纪录片，“Eno”是时尚、无缝、令人着迷的，尽管它感觉如此，原因之一是哈斯特威特从伊诺个人档案中汲取了500小时的影片和视频制作了*全部*关于布莱恩·伊诺的电影。在谈话头部分，这部电影几乎没有，除了伊诺本人，他通过整个电影也在讲述。这部纪录片利用他的观察来融合他的过去和现在，他不断变化的形象和角色，以一种强调他们的音乐和精神连续性的方式。
- en: At least half the film consists of Eno today, with a shaved head, white beard,
    and designer glasses (the film was shot when he was 74), seated in his pristine
    all-white home studio in a handsome stone house in the British countryside, talking
    about his highly reflective, almost artisanal philosophy of creation. There has
    long been an aura of enigma surrounding Brian Eno, and one of the film’s delights
    is that he turns out to be a brainy but also quite funny and grounded middle-class
    British chap who has great stories to tell and is always willing to have a chuckle
    at his own expense. He narrates his journey of art for us, and though we learn
    next to nothing about his personal life (he makes a reference to his daughter
    — in fact, he has three children), or about any of his friends or relationships,
    the aura that’s constructed, of Eno as a kind of ebullient art monk, feels like
    it’s telling his true story in a different way.

  zh: 电影中至少有一半的内容是当今的伊诺，他头发剃成了光头，留着白胡子，戴着设计师眼镜（这部电影是在他74岁时拍摄的），坐在他整洁的全白家庭工作室里，这座漂亮的石头房子坐落在英国乡村，讲述了他高度反思的、几乎是工匠的创作哲学。布莱恩·伊诺一直充满神秘色彩，这部电影的乐趣之一就是他原来是一个聪明但也非常幽默和脚踏实地的英国中产阶级家伙，有很棒的故事要讲，而且总是愿意自嘲一番。他为我们讲述了他的艺术之旅，尽管我们几乎没能了解他的个人生活（他提到了他的女儿——事实上，他有三个孩子），或者他的任何朋友或关系，但建立起来的神秘光环，使人感觉伊诺是一位热情洋溢的艺术僧侣，似乎以另一种方式在诉说他的真实故事。
- en: Much of the footage is great. Here’s Roxy Music performing “Virginia Plain”
    on “Top of the Pops,” and my God how bracing they sound — and it’s all about the
    sound, with Andy Mackay squawking on the oboe and Eno using his synthesizer to
    draw aural curlicues in the air. Here’s Eno in the studio with Bowie, sculpting
    what seemed then like the sound of the future, and here’s an extraordinary clip
    of him in the studio with U2, as “Pride (In the Name of Love)” comes into being
    before our ears, with Bono scat-singing the lines. And here’s Eno talking about
    the songs that inspired him to want to do what he does — like Little Richard’s
    “Tutti Frutti,” or the feminine splendor of Ketty Lester’s 1962 version of “Love
    Letters,” or “Get a Job” by the Silhouettes (a song he says made him never want
    to get a job, which he says he never did).

  zh: 许多镜头都很棒。这里是罗齐音乐在《热门金榜》上演奏《弗吉尼亚平原》，我的天哪，他们的声音多么令人振奋——全部都是关于声音的，安迪·麦凯在双簧管上嘶叫，伊诺用合成器在空中绘制听觉螺旋形。这里是伊诺在录音室与鲍威进行合作，塑造当时看起来像是未来之声的声音，还有一支非凡的节目是他与U2在录音室的一段视频，“骄傲（为爱命名）”在我们耳边产生，波诺用即兴唱法演唱这些歌词。还有伊诺谈论启发他想要做自己所做的事的歌曲——比如小理查德的《Tutti
    Frutti》，或凯蒂·莱斯特1962年版本的《爱的书信》女性的荣耀，或者Silhouettes的《Get a Job》（这首歌使他从未想过去找工作，他说他确实从未这样做）。
- en: 'Eno explains that he left Roxy Music mostly because he hated touring (“I wanted
    to get back to what I liked doing best, which is dabbling”), and he pays tribute
    to some of the artists who influenced him, like the Jamaican reggae producer Lee
    Perry, and talks about how he wanted to create “paintings that existed in time,”
    which is how he sees music. During the period of his ’70s solo albums, as good
    as a couple of them were (best all-time solo Eno track: “Needle in the Camel’s
    Eye,” the song that opens “Velvet Goldmine”), he says that he was regarded in
    England as “a failed glam-rock star.” He found his calling as a producer, which
    he has been for close to 50 years, though he never stopped making solo albums
    (he has close to 30 of them, including his gloriously ethereal music for the 1989
    Apollo space-flight documentary “For All Mankind”).'

  zh: Eno解释说，他离开罗齐音乐的主要原因是他讨厌巡演（“我想回到我最喜欢的事情，也就是涉猎”），并向一些影响他的艺术家致敬，比如牙买加雷鬼音乐制作人李·佩里，他谈论了他想要创造“时间存在的绘画”，这也是他看音乐的方式。在他70年代的个人专辑时期，尽管其中有一对颇为不错（有史以来最好的个人专辑的Eno曲目：《Needle
    in the Camel's Eye》，这首歌开启了《天鹅绒黄金》），但他说在英格兰被视为“一个失败的迷幻摇滚明星。” 他发现他的职业定位是制作人，他已经从事这项工作将近50年，尽管他从未停止制作个人专辑（他有近30张专辑，包括他为1989年阿波罗宇航飞行纪录片《为全人类》创作的神秘的音乐）。
- en: As for his *ruminating* on music, that’s a constantly evolving pastime, and
    a little of it, I have to say, goes a long way. “Eno” presents itself as an experimental
    documentary about a musical warlock who never lost his trend-setting edge, and
    that’s all well and good. The version of the movie you see might not have some
    of the scenes I’ve described, which is fine. One of the reasons the film got made
    in the first place is that Eno says he wouldn’t have been interested in collaborating
    on a more conventional documentary about him. Yet I, for one, would have been
    happy to see that film, with testimonials from Bryan Ferry or whoever, and the
    appeal of “Eno” — like the appeal of Brian Eno himself — is that the film conjures
    a wholehearted and accessible experience within an experimental veneer.

  zh: 至于他对音乐的*沉思*，这是一个不断发展的消遣，我不得不说，有些有点烦。《Eno》被呈现为一部关于一个从未失去开拓潮流边缘的音乐术士的实验性纪录片，这一切都很好。你所看到的电影版本可能不包括我描述的一些场景，这没关系。这部电影之所以得以制作，其中一个原因是Eno说他对与他合作制作一部更传统的关于他的纪录片不感兴趣。然而，至少我会乐意看到那部电影，里面有来自布莱恩·费里等人的推荐，而《Eno》的吸引力——就像布莱恩·伊诺本人一样——是这部电影在实验薄层背后呈现出一个全心全意而且容易接近的经历。
