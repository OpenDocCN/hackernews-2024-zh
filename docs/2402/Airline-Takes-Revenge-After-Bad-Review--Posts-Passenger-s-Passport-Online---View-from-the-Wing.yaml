    courts drama, it seems. Just a couple of months ago he was [banned by Qatar Airways
    over a negative review](https://onemileatatime.com/news/qatar-airways-bans-youtuber-negative-review/).

    Airport in East Timor, posted a negative review of his trip on the airline’s only
    jet, and claimed to have gotten food poisoning on board.

    a photo of his… passport?

    photo wasn’t illegal. (I’d note that the government of East Timor introduced a
    draft Data Privacy and Protection Law in 2021 but it is not in effect.) Aero Dili
    is not an IATA member, so didn’t run afoul of their guidelines either. He wants
    his viewers to demand that Singapore block Aero Dili’s planned service there because
    of its failure to adhere to data protection standards.

    that it’s a poor practice on the part of the airline to post this passport photo.
    There’s nothing to be gained, and opens them up to significant criticism. He believes
    Cahill that the demands supposedly placed on the airline are “totally made up.”'

    by the airline are completely baseless. C’mon, he wanted a free flight, a food
    allowance, and $50,000, in exchange for a positive review, from a small, national
    airline? No, that’s totally made up.

    to sponsor the review? As *OMAAT* observes the amount requested would be a bit
    rich for Aero Dili.

    or absolute misery – in order to perform well.

- en: The airline maybe believes it was extortion, while Cahill just sees himself
    reporting (and perhaps dramatizing) what actually happened? Posting an email outlining
    the YouTuber’s sponsorship request, if there was one, would have been far more
    appropriate than posting a photo of his passport.

    I have to think they’re overwhelmed, it’s literally an airline that lists aerodili2018
    as its gmail address.
