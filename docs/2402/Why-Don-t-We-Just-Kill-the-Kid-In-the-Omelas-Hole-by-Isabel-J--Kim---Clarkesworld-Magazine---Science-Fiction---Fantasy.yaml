    Or they (the general “they,” the “they” that meant you and me and the janitors
    and the newscasters) assumed that the kid was crying, because the hole was soundproofed

    beautiful city is built on!” and the kid bled out and it was extremely graphic
    to the point of being censored in later broadcasts. And one of the tracks of the
    free public transit system twisted loose, and a bunch of commuters were killed

    sorrowfully and the social media posters (every citizen in Omelas had a healthy
    and regular relationship with social media and not a bad and addictive one) talked
    about how this was a real tragedy because even though we knew that there was a
    kid in the hole, now that’s three times as many kids in the hole, and it’s extra

- en: This sentiment made the Omelans kind of upset. They pointed out that Omelas
    was a better place to live than most other places because at least you knew the
    load-bearing suffering child suffered for a reason, as opposed to all the other
    kids who were suffering for no reason. Out there, kids had their arms ripped off
    while they were working in chicken processing plants, kids were left in baby boxes,
    and kids lived in perfect quiet misery with one parent who was an alcoholic and
    another parent who beat them. In Omelas, there were only good parents and no child
    suffered except the single one who did. How dare you say shit about our fair city
    and our single child, when you won’t even help your own.

- en: 'What the Omelans didn’t say was that their second grievance was due to the
    fact that the kid killers had broken the unspoken code: if you had a problem with
    the load-bearing suffering child, you were supposed to get the hell out of Omelas
    and keep it to yourself. You weren’t supposed to kill the kid. As a teenager,
    you were supposed to learn the blunt truth that your society was built on a single
    ongoing act of senseless, meaningless cruelty, and then you were supposed to cry
    about it or rage about it, but either way you were supposed to get over it and
    grow up and get on with your fully-paid-for-by-the-state education system and

  zh: 现在奥美拉斯有一个非常长的维基百科条目，有一个关于负重忍受的孩子的子文章，还有一个关于死去孩子的第二个子文章。他们告诉你孩子们死后的事情。他们的名字是什么。他们承诺这些孩子是道德来源的。但没有引用。有些人说洞里再也没有孩子了。他们多次移动了洞的位置，也不再让人知道位置。他们增加了额外的隔音设备。
- en: Most days, Omelas is sunny and beautiful and nothing bad happens. And then there
    will be a day that is overcast and cloudy, and on that day, people die in circus
    accidents and carbon monoxide leaks and start harassment campaigns on twitter.
    And sometimes on that day people die through lethal injection. So it’s clear that
    sometimes the kid is alive and suffering, and sometimes the kid has been killed
    and doesn’t exist.

  zh: 大多数时候，奥美拉斯阳光明媚，美丽无暇，什么坏事都不会发生。然后会有一天阴天多云，那一天，在马戏团事故和一氧化碳泄漏中有人死亡，并在推特上开始骚扰运动。有时在那一天人们通过注射死亡。所以很明显，有时孩子是活着并且在受苦，有时孩子已经被杀死并不存在了。

- en: Occasionally a content creator will walk into Omelas and film a video while
    standing on one of the balconies of the Nice Houses or while sitting on one of
    Omelas’ beautiful beaches. They will talk about the history of Omelas in the same
    way that people talk about the Uyghurs situation in China, the concentration camps
    of the Third Reich, the comfort women imported from Korea by Japan, the Belgium
    Congo, the Atlantic Slave Trade in relation to the American South, and the refugees
    who sink in ships off the coast of Western Europe.

  zh: 偶尔，一位内容创作者会走进奥美拉斯，站在美丽房屋的阳台上或坐在奥美拉斯美丽的海滩上拍摄视频。他们会像谈论中国的维吾尔族情况、第三帝国的集中营、日本从韩国引进的慰安妇、比利时刚果、与美国南方有关的大西洋奴隶贸易以及在西欧海岸附近沉船的难民那样谈论奥美拉斯的历史。
- en: 'And they (the ones who visit Omelas) say: Thank God we aren’t dealing with
    that horrid wound in society. Thank God there is somewhere that shows us how fucking
    bad things could get. What a pit in the ground. What a fucked up little trolley
    problem. What a lesson for us. Thank God we don’t live there. Thank God we know
    it exists.'

  zh: 访问奥美拉斯的人们说：感谢上帝，我们不用处理社会上那可怕的伤口。感谢上帝，有一个地方向我们展示事情可能有多糟糕。这真是个地洞。多么混乱的小路线问题。这对我们是个教训。感谢上帝，我们不住在那里。感谢上帝，我们知道它的存在。
