    the lights went out in Omelas: click, click, click. And the pipes burst and there
    was a sewage leak and the newscasters said there was a typhoon on the way, so
    they (a different “they,” these were the “they” in charge, the “they” who lived
    in the nice houses in Omelas [okay, every house in Omelas was a nice house, but
    these were Nice Houses]) got another kid and put it in the hole.'

- en: And the newscasters said the hurricane had dissipated into a tropical storm,
    and the pipes were repaired, and the well-paid janitors cleaned up the sewage
    leak while wearing proper PPE, and the kid in the hole cried and cried and cried.
    Or they (the general “they,” the “they” that meant you and me and the janitors
    and the newscasters) assumed that the kid was crying, because the hole was soundproofed
    so nobody could hear the kid, which didn’t stop them from knowing about the kid,
    but it sort of helped.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So they (the first “they”) killed the kid again. They stormed the hole and broke
    the kid out and slit the kid’s throat on public television (as all television
    in Omelas was publicly funded), and they said, “Look at what sort of shit your
    beautiful city is built on!” and the kid bled out and it was extremely graphic
    to the point of being censored in later broadcasts. And one of the tracks of the
    free public transit system twisted loose, and a bunch of commuters were killed
    in a freak accident, and the stock market started shuddering downward, and a house
    collapsed on the south side of Omelas.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So they (the “Nice Houses” they) got a third kid and stuck it in the hole. They
    felt weird about it, but they liked their Nice Houses, and also, they really did
    truly and wholeheartedly care about the well-being of Omelas and all of the citizens
    except for the kid in the hole. The newscasters talked about the second dead kid
    sorrowfully and the social media posters (every citizen in Omelas had a healthy
    and regular relationship with social media and not a bad and addictive one) talked
    about how this was a real tragedy because even though we knew that there was a
    kid in the hole, now that’s three times as many kids in the hole, and it’s extra
    sad because we usually don’t kill the kid in the hole, they usually die of old
    age or malnutrition.

    the hole experience.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But nobody heard the third kid’s sobbing because of the soundproofing, and also
    because now no one was allowed to go see the kid since security had been beefed
    up around the load-bearing suffering child to prevent its death and prolong its
    suffering. Which meant that the kid-killers had to seriously plan the next attempt,
    and everyone had time to decompress from the first two murders of the load-bearing
    suffering child, and also, the video of the second very graphic murder circulated
    outside of Omelas.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Everyone (me, you, the newscasters, the janitors with the good PPE, the children
    who lived inside and outside Omelas) was performatively disgusted by the video.
    Everyone watched it anyway. It went viral like a snuff film went viral or Kim
    Kardashian’s first sex tape went viral, and it was like the load-bearing suffering
    child was in everyone’s home at once, like there were a million load-bearing suffering
    children looking at you from a million screens.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Many non-Omelan people said a lot of very mean things (no one outside Omelas
    had a good and normal relationship with social media), like that the Omelans were
    monsters for letting the load-bearing suffering child exist and therefore everything
    about Omelas was fucked beyond belief, and had they known about the load-bearing
    suffering child, they never would have visited Omelas’ beautiful beaches and nightclubs
    and festivals, because the knowledge of the child was so goddamn fucking horrific
    and tainted everything. And maybe it was the Omelans who should be killed.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This sentiment made the Omelans kind of upset. They pointed out that Omelas
    was a better place to live than most other places because at least you knew the
    load-bearing suffering child suffered for a reason, as opposed to all the other
    kids who were suffering for no reason. Out there, kids had their arms ripped off
    while they were working in chicken processing plants, kids were left in baby boxes,
    and kids lived in perfect quiet misery with one parent who was an alcoholic and
    another parent who beat them. In Omelas, there were only good parents and no child
    suffered except the single one who did. How dare you say shit about our fair city
    and our single child, when you won’t even help your own.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'What the Omelans didn’t say was that their second grievance was due to the
    fact that the kid killers had broken the unspoken code: if you had a problem with
    the load-bearing suffering child, you were supposed to get the hell out of Omelas
    and keep it to yourself. You weren’t supposed to kill the kid. As a teenager,
    you were supposed to learn the blunt truth that your society was built on a single
    ongoing act of senseless, meaningless cruelty, and then you were supposed to cry
    about it or rage about it, but either way you were supposed to get over it and
    grow up and get on with your fully-paid-for-by-the-state education system and
    your festivals and your legal weed and your *drooz*.'

    make the sweetness of the rest of Omelas richer. Without the kid in the hole,
    Omelas was just paradise. With the load-bearing, suffering child, Omelas meant
    something.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And of course, it was true that the whole city literally ran on the load-bearing
    suffering child in a very real physical way that was not a metaphor. And everyone
    really liked having running power and no blackouts and good schools and low crime
    and community-oriented government and safe sidewalks and public transit that worked.
  prefs: []

- en: Things got really toxic online. Then the third kid was killed.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This time it was harder to say who the killers were, because the first they,
    the killers, had osmosed into the second they (the “they” of the Nice Houses),
    and also, the third they (the “they” who were the janitors with the good PPE equipment,
    and the newscasters). So it was never discovered who exactly slipped through all
    the protections and the soundproofing and the soldiers with tranquilizer guns
    (because there were no real guns in Omelas) and stole the kid from the hole and
    killed it in the conference room where the people with the Nice Houses met to
    talk about government.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There was no message this time because the dead kid on the table was the message.
    The dead kid had been dressed just like every other kid in Omelas (comfortable,
    affordable clothing of good quality, with adorable patterns), and it hadn’t been
    in the hole for long enough to develop the really horrific features that the kids
    in the hole always developed (open and weeping sores on their butts, skinny limbs
    and a protruding stomach, a sort of lank greasiness that permeated their entire
    being), and this third dead kid mostly just looked a little skinny, and grimy,
    and asleep.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There was an earthquake that cracked the west side and opened a sinkhole, and
    four cars were swallowed up in a freak accident. They talked about it on the news,
    alongside photos of the dead kid dressed up in the conference room. And because
    the Omelans all had very good educations where they learned about the literary
    meaning of symbols, they knew that the dead kid in pretty clothing was a reminder
    of the fact that the child in the hole was also an Omelan child.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'The rest of the world, which had variable public education and overworked language
    arts teachers, freaked out on social media. The sentiment boiled down to: “If
    Omelas is a perfect city and has really good social services and there is ready
    access to birth control and easy ways for people with wombs to give up the infants
    they gestated to people that want them, and therefore all children are wanted
    and cared for by someone in Omelas, regardless of whether it is their biological
    progenitor, where do the Omelans get the load-bearing suffering child?”'

- en: 'And the follow-up freak-out: “Oh my god, they must be stealing our children.”'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Of course, nothing in the freak-outs materially touched the Omelans, because
    Omelas was a shining city on a hill that could only be hurt when there was no
    load-bearing suffering child, and the dead child had been immediately replaced,
    so Omelas wasn’t assaulted by foreign troops, and there were no trade sanctions
    against it, and people didn’t stop going to its beaches. But they had to do some
    media spin, and the Nice House Experiencers went on TV to reassure the world that
    the load-bearing suffering child was an ethically sourced, no one’s son, and definitely
    an Omelan, and meanwhile some of the Nice House Experiencers privately spoke among
    each other.

    said. “Maybe the kid in the hole was always a bad idea.”

    the eye and tell me there is a better solution than putting one single kid in
    the hole, and letting that one single kid have a miserable life, in return for
    the good lives of all of our children?”

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    she knew in her heart of hearts that she would damn every last person in Omelas
    rather than subject her child to the hole.

    the kid?”
  prefs: []

    to shouting until at one point someone said: “Why are we arguing so much when
    the kid is in the hole? The kid is in the hole, which means that we shouldn’t
    have so much infighting. What is the point of the kid in the hole if we can’t
    even get our act together!”'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That had many philosophical implications on whether disagreements can exist
    in paradise, but in reality, all of this bullshit only meant that the people with
    the Nice Houses were distracted enough that the fourth kid was killed easily,
    and without much fanfare.

    and an incidence of road rage with a tranquilizer gun that left four dead.

    caught him on the newly installed CCTV cameras that did ’round the clock surveillance.
    They arrested him at his home, which was near the sinkhole.

    about him looked like a murderer or a dissident. He looked just like every other
    person who had benefited from Omelas’ many social safety networks and had grown
    up without ever knowing suffering.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Before his execution, they (the people with the Nice Houses, as a proxy for
    the newscasters, as a proxy for everyone else) asked him why he was doing this.
    The murderer didn’t shrug, because he was being held by a Kevlar straitjacket,
    which had been imported from outside.

    of doing something that we pretend that we are living better lives without suffering.

    every single one, because at the end of the day, admittedly, every person in Omelas

    the syringe and the chemicals.

    back. “We will keep killing the kid in the hole. You are going to run out of kids
    before we stop killing the kids that go into the hole. Even if you kill me, now
    we all know about killing the load-bearing suffering child. You can’t kill me
    in any way that matters. The kid will die again and again until you stop putting
    kids in the hole.”

    that wasn’t tied to a separate insurance) and was executed by painless lethal
    injection and so became the first person in Omelas (other than all the load-bearing
    suffering children) who Omelas, as a state, had killed, and Omelas became the
    sort of city that killed people using painless lethal injection.
  prefs: []

    wasn’t in the hole, so it was a fluke, the same way the typhoon was a fluke, the
    homophobia was a fluke, the Omelans being shitheads on social media was a fluke.
    It was something that could only happen while Omelas wasn’t *Omelas* and was instead
    just like every other city with no load-bearing suffering child and many load-bearing
    suffering adults.

    then the executioner walked out of Omelas, but no one paid attention to her leaving.

    things continued in this cyclical fashion for a while. Kids were put in a series
    of holes and were summarily killed. The deaths were reported on public television
    and were dissected badly on social media through a variety of angles.
