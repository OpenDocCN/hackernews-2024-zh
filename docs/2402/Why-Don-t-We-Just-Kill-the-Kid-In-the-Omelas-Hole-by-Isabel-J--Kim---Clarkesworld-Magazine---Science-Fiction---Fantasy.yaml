    the kid out and slit the kid’s throat on public television (as all television
    in Omelas was publicly funded), and they said, “Look at what sort of shit your
    beautiful city is built on!” and the kid bled out and it was extremely graphic
    to the point of being censored in later broadcasts. And one of the tracks of the
    free public transit system twisted loose, and a bunch of commuters were killed

    sorrowfully and the social media posters (every citizen in Omelas had a healthy
    and regular relationship with social media and not a bad and addictive one) talked
    about how this was a real tragedy because even though we knew that there was a
    kid in the hole, now that’s three times as many kids in the hole, and it’s extra

    was a better place to live than most other places because at least you knew the

    the load-bearing suffering child, and a second subarticle about the children who
    died. They tell you about the children now, after they die. What their names are.
    They promise that the children are ethically sourced. But there aren’t any citations.
    And some people say that there isn’t a kid in the hole anymore. They’ve moved
    the hole a bunch of times, and they don’t let people know the location anymore.
    They have extra soundproofing.

  zh: 现在奥美拉斯有一个非常长的维基百科条目，有一个关于负重忍受的孩子的子文章，还有一个关于死去孩子的第二个子文章。他们告诉你孩子们死后的事情。他们的名字是什么。他们承诺这些孩子是道德来源的。但没有引用。有些人说洞里再也没有孩子了。他们多次移动了洞的位置，也不再让人知道位置。他们增加了额外的隔音设备。

    will be a day that is overcast and cloudy, and on that day, people die in circus
    accidents and carbon monoxide leaks and start harassment campaigns on twitter.

    sometimes the kid is alive and suffering, and sometimes the kid has been killed
    and doesn’t exist.
