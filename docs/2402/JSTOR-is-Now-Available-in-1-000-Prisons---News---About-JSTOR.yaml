    of secondary and primary sources to support teaching and learning—reached a once
    unimaginable goal: providing JSTOR access in 1,000 prisons. Spread across four
    continents, the [JSTOR Access in Prison](https://about.jstor.org/jstor-access-in-prison/)
    initiative now supports the education and growth of more than 550,000 incarcerated
    people.'

- en: Incarcerated learners have been left behind for decades. Limited access to the
    internet and scarce funding and support for higher education in prisons made access
    to digital libraries like JSTOR all but impossible. In October 2021, with funding
    from the Mellon Foundation, JSTOR [set an ambitious goal](https://www.ithaka.org/news/mellon-foundation-awards-ithaka-1-5-million-to-make-jstor-accessible-to-incarcerated-college-students/)
    to change that. The aspiration? For every incarcerated college student in the
    United States to have access to JSTOR, along with the research skills to use it
    and other digital resources.

- en: Prior to 2021, JSTOR developed an offline index of its digital library. At the
    time, less than twenty prisons had access to it. Since then, developers have created
    an online version that meets the unique needs of carceral settings, most recently
    delivering online access on tablets. These changes—and the leadership of Stacy
    Burnett, a graduate of the Bard Prison Initiative who was hired to lead the JSTOR
    Access in Prison initiative—have enabled 1,000 prisons and more than 500,000 people
    to gain access to the digital equivalent of a college library.

    to pay forward my own prison-based education,” said Burnett. “We have proven that
    through understanding, collaboration, and creativity, we can create workable solutions
    that deliver meaningful digital equity and information literacy for incarcerated
    people.”

    growing. The students in Ohio prisons have reviewed nearly 30,000 unique articles
    over the past year, with 10% in the last month. Access there will be expanded
    to the prison general libraries. The students at Tennessee Higher Education Initiative
    regularly access 2,400 unique articles in a month—the highest per capita use in
    the country for incarcerated learners. Those pursuing higher education use JSTOR
    for research and coursework. Others use JSTOR to pursue a passion for learning
    and to gain skills they will need once they re-enter society.

- en: L. Elizabeth Shatswell, a soon-to-be graduate of the University of Puget Sound,
    spent nearly two decades pursuing her high school and college education behind
    bars. She was able to conduct research on JSTOR that helped her advocate for an
    elderly incarcerated woman who required humane patient care. That experience changed
    Shatswell’s life. She said, “Prior to JSTOR, I knew full well there were disparities
    in access to healthcare for both women and incarcerated populations, but I did
    not know the scope. JSTOR facilitated the development of my voice in understanding
    these gaps and as a result I founded a program called the HOPE Team that uses
    evidence-based research to make changes to healthcare policy and practice.”

- en: Prison access to JSTOR is free thanks to subsidies from ITHAKA, the nonprofit
    home of JSTOR, and generous grants from Ascendium and Mellon Foundation. Giving
    incarcerated learners access to JSTOR is impactful, but it hasn’t been easy. There
    are challenges in navigating different cultures and decision-making processes,
    and finding creative solutions to issues in technology infrastructure and support,
    which vary widely from one site to the next.

    worked with enough prisons now that when we encounter a question or issue, we’ve
    seen it before and have a solution. We’re making it easier and easier for them
    to say ‘yes’.”
