- en: 'Reconstructing and rendering 3D objects from highly sparse views is of critical
    importance for promoting applications of 3D vision techniques and improving user
    experience. However, images from sparse views only contain very limited 3D information,
    leading to two significant challenges: 1) Difficulty in building multi-view consistency
    as images for matching are too few; 2) Partially omitted or highly compressed
    object information as view coverage is insufficient. To tackle these challenges,
    we propose GaussianObject, a framework to represent and render the 3D object with
    Gaussian splatting, that achieves high rendering quality with only **4 input images**.
    We first introduce techniques of visual hull and floater elimination which explicitly
    inject structure priors into the initial optimization process for helping build
    multi-view consistency, yielding a coarse 3D Gaussian representation. Then we
    construct a Gaussian repair model based on diffusion models to supplement the
    omitted object information, where Gaussians are further refined. We design a self-generating
    strategy to obtain image pairs for training the repair model. Our GaussianObject
    is evaluated on several challenging datasets, including MipNeRF360, OmniObject3D,
    and OpenIllumination, achieving strong reconstruction results from **only 4 views**
    and significantly outperforming previous state-of-the-art methods.'
