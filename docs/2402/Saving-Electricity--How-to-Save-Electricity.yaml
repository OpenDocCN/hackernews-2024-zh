- en: I studied your site after deciding that I was determined to put an end to paying
    for (and wasting) lots of electricity.  I bought a kilowatt meter to measure my
    usage.  In the first month I dropped my from 578 kWh avg. to 197 kWh.  This past
    month after replacing my 1980's fridge with a new one I was able to get down to
    150 kilowatt-hours, and that includes my home office.  My electric company lets
    you look at and compare the past 14 months worth of usage and bills online.  I
    saved $50 this past month compared to last year and plan on saving more than $1000
    for the year over 2004.  Our rates are about 14 cents for delivery and usage not
    including the $7.36 customer charge, so this has made a big impact.  So I just
    wanted express a quick 'thank you' for your site.  I appreciate the depth of information
    and the ability to reference many other sites. *best regards, Aaron Patt* Thank
    you for making 'Saving Electricity.'  I googled for a site about using the window
    units in my apartment more efficiently (I'm used to central air) and after reading
    your site I've gone from running two window units and a fan on high and still
    being uncomfortably warm to sitting directly in front of a single fan, on low,
    and I'm a little chilly. I think I'm also going to purchase clothes drying rack.
    I have a wacky idea about trying to use my fan and hanging my clothes up to dry
    in conjunction.... *—*[*Veronica Pare*](http://www.veronicapare.com/)

    感谢您制作“节约电力”。我谷歌搜索了一个关于如何更有效地使用我公寓中的窗式空调的网站（我习惯了中央空调），在阅读了您的网站之后，我从运行两个窗式空调和一个高速风扇仍然感到不舒服到现在只需要一个低速风扇，坐在那里有点冷。我想我也要购买一个晾衣架。我有一个疯狂的想法，试图使用风扇和挂衣服晾干相结合...
