    in 1999.**  I was telling you about LED lights, front-loading washers, and heat
    pump heating *years* before they started to become mainstream.  I don''t have
    time to update the site much these days, but most of the old info is still true
    today.  In fact, the site is better than most articles about saving electricity
    in the popular press, which don''t include useful numbers or which get their facts

    guzzling the most juice (and which ones are the best targets for savings).  You''ll
    also learn exactly [how to read your electric meter](measure.html), if you like.

    \ But the pollution is there\x97it just happens at the power plant instead of\

    one of the first scientists to warn about global warming way back in the 80s,
    said that[**the real key to preventing climate change is reducing home energy
    use**](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/06/23/AR2008062301920.html?hpid=opinionsbox1)**.** 
    That''s because, as he says, we can''t stop the oil from being burned for transport,
    since if we don''t use it, another country will. But we can certainly stop burning
    our own country''s coal.  And the quickest way to reduce coal emissions is to
    reduce our electricity consumption. ([more on climate change](climatechange.html))'

    It's outstanding. I've been working to improve my finances for a while, and every
    little bit helps. I just posted about your Saving Electricity site on my site
    (Get Rich Slowly). I hope to steer others to the information you've provided.
    *-- J.D. Roth,* [*Get Rich Slowly*](http://www.getrichslowly.org/blog/) I love
    your site, I have cut my oil bill in half by using space heaters which has really
    saved me money as a direct result of your advice. *- Andrew G.*

    for (and wasting) lots of electricity.  I bought a kilowatt meter to measure my
    usage.  In the first month I dropped my from 578 kWh avg. to 197 kWh.  This past
    month after replacing my 1980's fridge with a new one I was able to get down to
    150 kilowatt-hours, and that includes my home office.  My electric company lets
    you look at and compare the past 14 months worth of usage and bills online.  I
    saved $50 this past month compared to last year and plan on saving more than $1000
    for the year over 2004.  Our rates are about 14 cents for delivery and usage not
    including the $7.36 customer charge, so this has made a big impact.  So I just
    wanted express a quick 'thank you' for your site.  I appreciate the depth of information
    and the ability to reference many other sites. *best regards, Aaron Patt* Thank
    you for making 'Saving Electricity.'  I googled for a site about using the window
    units in my apartment more efficiently (I'm used to central air) and after reading
    your site I've gone from running two window units and a fan on high and still
    being uncomfortably warm to sitting directly in front of a single fan, on low,
    and I'm a little chilly. I think I'm also going to purchase clothes drying rack.
    I have a wacky idea about trying to use my fan and hanging my clothes up to dry
    in conjunction.... *—*[*Veronica Pare*](http://www.veronicapare.com/)

    are no longer taking any more questions.  You've written the definitive guide
    to all things electric.  That anyone could take offense or consider you less than
    reasonable for retiring on the subject is unbelievable.  Those of us who are concerned
    about the environment - and "living below our means" - salute you. Thank you for
