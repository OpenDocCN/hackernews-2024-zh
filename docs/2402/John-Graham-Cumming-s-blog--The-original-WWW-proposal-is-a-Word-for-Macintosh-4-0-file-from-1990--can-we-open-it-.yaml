    should have looked. And that's where it became obvious that the original document
    on the original Mac and the CERN PDF are quite different. The CERN PDF has 20
    pages. On the Mac running Word for Macintosh 4.0 with A4 paper it has 22 pages.
    So I decided to aim to get us close to the original document on the Mac.

- en: So... set to A4 paper and set right margin to same size as left margin. Change
    the first page format to be different since it doesn't have the same gutters,
    footers or headers. Manually change the body text from 14 pt (and other sizes)
    to 12 pt. Manually deal with text that breaks across pages incorrectly and other
    alignment problems. Fix the footer that should be a header.
