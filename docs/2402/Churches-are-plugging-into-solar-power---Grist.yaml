    Michigan, people gathered in the Greensky Hill Indian United Methodist Church.
    The small, one-room log building is almost 200 years old and the hymns are sung
    in English and Anishinaabemowin.

    of his last, since he would soon retire. In between reflections on scripture,
    Mays touched on an important venture: The church was planning to install solar
    panels on its larger meeting hall, working with Michigan-based nonprofit [Solar
    Faithful](https://solarfaithful.org/) to do so.'

    systems, according to [Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory](https://emp.lbl.gov/publications/solar-pv-us-houses-worship-overview),
    which the University of California manages for the U.S. Department of Energy.
    That’s disproportionately high; houses of worship make up only 0.6 percent of
    all non-residential buildings.

    budgets, older buildings, and more pressing priorities. And switching energy systems
    can mean a lot of bureaucratic paperwork for which they might not have the staff.

    capitalizing on renewable energy tax benefits.

    from the tax credits. For instance, an investor could buy and install solar panels
    on a church. The church would buy that power from the investor, but wouldn’t own
    the panels — an arrangement called a power purchase agreement.

    it possible for governments and tax-exempt entities, including houses of worship,
    to get tax credits for renewable projects. Called [direct pay](https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy1533#:~:text=The%20Inflation%20Reduction%20Act%20allows,electric%20vehicles%20and%20charging%20stations),
    the program provides them with a [tax credit](https://www.whitehouse.gov/cleanenergy/directpay/)
    worth up to 30 percent of the installation cost. That can help cover some expenses,
    and advocates say it’s critical to getting more congregations to consider solar.

    energy, First Lutheran will pay off the project cost of around $175,000 to an

    investor. Once that’s done, the power that comes from the array is essentially
    free.
