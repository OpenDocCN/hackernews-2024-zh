- en: These two events were not disconnected. Spotify data alchemist Glenn McDonald,
    who created EveryNoise, was one of the 1,500 employees who was let go that day,
    but his layoff had wider-reaching implications; now that McDonald doesn’t have
    access to internal Spotify data, he can no longer maintain EveryNoise, which became
    a pivotal resource for the most obsessive music fans to track new releases and
    learn more about the sounds they love.

  zh: 这两件事件并非毫无关联。Spotify的数据炼金术士Glenn McDonald创建了EveryNoise，他也是当天被裁员的1,500名员工之一，但他的裁员带来了更广泛的影响；现在McDonald无法访问内部Spotify数据，也就无法维护EveryNoise，这对于那些痴迷于音乐的粉丝来说，失去了一个追踪新发行音乐和了解他们喜爱的声音的关键资源。
- en: “The project is to understand the communities of listening that exist in the
    world, figure out what they’re called, what artists are in them and what their
    audiences are,” McDonald told TechCrunch. “The goal is to use math where you can

    Spotify is sitting on an unfathomably large catalog of music and better metadata
