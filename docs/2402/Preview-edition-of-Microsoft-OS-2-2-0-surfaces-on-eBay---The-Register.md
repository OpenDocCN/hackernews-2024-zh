# Preview edition of Microsoft OS/2 2.0 surfaces on eBay • The Register

> 来源：[https://www.theregister.com/2024/02/20/microsoft_os2_2_0_beta/](https://www.theregister.com/2024/02/20/microsoft_os2_2_0_beta/)

A version of OS/2 2.0 from Microsoft, *not* IBM, just surfaced on eBay. This pre-release version came out after Windows 3.0.

How much might you be willing to pay to own a piece of operating system history? Would you pay two-thirds of a grand? No, us neither, but fortunately for posterity, *Reg* reader Brian Ledbetter is. He wrote to tell us that he bought the [*ULTRA RARE: IBM / Microsoft OS/2 SDK Version 2 Pre-Release 2 for v1 Users [Beta]*](https://www.ebay.com/itm/116062509354) for a non-trivial six hundred and fifty of your U.S. dollars.

The original Microsoft OS/2 1 SDK was a snip at [just $3,000](https://logos.fandom.com/wiki/OS/2), but you can [grab a copy](https://archive.org/details/ms-os2-sdk-1.00) for free from the Internet Archive. Microsoft's press release for the first preview release, thus far lost to history, is dated December 29, 1989, and says:

This means Mr Ledbetter got it for a song – just one-quarter of its original list price.

We also enjoyed this detail:

Microsoft co-developed OS/2 with IBM, but it only sold the 80286-specific OS/2 1 under its own branding. As the *Reg* [covered in depth](https://www.theregister.com/Print/2012/11/27/the_os_wars_os2_25years_old/) back when OS/2 turned 25, when OS/2 *1* failed to change the world, Microsoft pivoted, revamped the equally lackluster Windows 2 to create the best-selling Windows 3, and moved on… and onwards and upwards.

However, Microsoft did do some development work on the 32-bit OS/2 2.0 before the divorce. A version of the official Microsoft 32-bit OS/2 Software Development Kit was found about a decade ago, and [Virtually Fun](https://virtuallyfun.com/2013/11/05/microsoft-os2-2-0-sdk-beta/) got it working and shared some screenshots of a 32-bit Microsoft C compiler from about a year before the first preview release of Windows NT. As they said then:

Keen software archeologists did know about the existence of Microsoft OS/2 2.0\. It was [covered in PC Mag in 1990](https://books.google.com.hk/books?id=FK9cQfDtQZkC&lpg=PP1&pg=PT391#v=onepage&q&f=false), from which Virtually Fun [sourced the only known screenshot](https://virtuallyfun.com/2014/05/09/a-sneak-peak-at-microsoft-os2-2-0/). Well, finally, it looks like a copy of that operating system showed up.

OS/2 2.0 was intended to appear back in 1990, but Windows 3.0 [shipped in May that year](https://www.theregister.com/2010/05/24/windows_3_turns_20/) and was a huge hit, [selling 10 million copies](https://www.theregister.com/2013/05/23/microsoft_windows3_birthday/). Microsoft pulled out of the partnership, forcing IBM to go it alone and delaying the release of IBM OS/2 2.0 until 1992 – critically, after Microsoft had achieved market- (and mind-) share.

Several beta versions of IBM OS/2 2 have been found and archived, and the OS/2 Museum has detailed reports on the [Spring '91 Edition](https://www.os2museum.com/wp/os-2-2-0-spring-91-edition/), the [Summer '91 Edition](https://www.os2museum.com/wp/os2-2-0-summer-91-edition/) and the [Xmas '91 Edition](https://www.os2museum.com/wp/os2-2-0-xmas-91-edition/). The oldest of these still has an OS/2 1.3-style "Desktop Manager" rather than the snazzy new Workplace Shell.

Michal Nečásek of the OS/2 Museum told us:

Microsoft kept selling OS/2 1.x for longer than you might think. Nečásek told us:
