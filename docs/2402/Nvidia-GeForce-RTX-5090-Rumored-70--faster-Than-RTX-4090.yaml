    a long way off, with a likely end of 2024 launch. What we do know is that the
    successor to the current Ada Lovelace generation of RTX 4000-series graphics cards
    will use the Blackwell architecture, with an RTX 5090 launching in late 2024,
    with wide availability not expected till early 2025.

    will be targeted by Nvidia first, which isn't unusual, aiming for those wanting
    the latest tech. The RTX 4090 cost a slightly eye-watering $1,599 at launch, but
    speaking of fatter wallets, the video also suggests a price increase north of
    $2,000\. There's good reason to suspect this too.

    have been significant price increases for the last few generations. The recent
    RTX Super series saw prices remain mostly static compared to the original 4000-series,
    which was a welcome if modest piece of good news for gamers' wallets.

    the likes of the RTX 5090 in future. The X post below from reliable hardware news
    leaker Kepler_L2 claims a similar situation with AMD's 8000-series to what we've
    seen in the past, with the company instead focussing on the mid-range to focus
    its recourses.

    to Nvidia's mid-range cards with models such as the RTX 2080 Super and RTX 2080
    Ti sitting well above it. Unsurprisingly, that monopoly at the high-end saw Nvidia's
    pricing skyrocket too, which is the worry with the RTX 5000-series if AMD lacks
    any competition here.

    we usually see cut-down models for PC gamers, which is what happened with the
    RTX 3090 and RTX 4090\. The result of government restrictions on sales to China
    might have a small impact, but it's still likely Nvidia will enjoy dominance at
    the top end and essentially charge what it likes.

    Only a very small percentage of gamers opt for these expensive high-end cards
    so AMD focussing on the mid-range and below could be a good thing for the average
    PC gamer. We're still a way off the RTX 5000 expected launch, but 2024 is likely
    to be thick with rumors of it plus AMD's alternative and Zen 5 Ryzen 9000 CPUs
    as well as Intel's 15th Gen CPUs. I'll be reporting on all the news so follow
    me here on Forbes for the latest rumors, news and analysis.
