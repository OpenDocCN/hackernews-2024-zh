    with a model-based (machine learning) alpha in [Python with Databento and sklearn](https://databento.com/blog/hft-sklearn-python).

    trading strategy instead. We'll also show you how you can compute trading metrics
    like PnL online with Databento's real-time feed. This example is adaptable to
    high-frequency trading (HFT) and mid-frequency trading scenarios.

- en: '**Feature**: Any kind of basic independent variable that''s thought to have
    some predictive value. This follows machine learning nomenclature; others may
    refer to this as a predictor or regressor in a statistical or econometric setting.'

    one order left at the best offer, lift the offer; if there is only one order left
    at the best bid, hit the bid." A trading rule may be a hardcoded trading decision
    taken when a feature value exceeds a certain threshold.'

- en: '**High-frequency strategy**: A strategy characterized by a large number of
    trades. There''s no public consensus on what this means, but such strategies will
    usually show high directional turnover, at least 20 bps ADV, and small maximum
    position. Importantly, low latency and short holding period are not necessary
    conditions, but in practice, most such strategies exhibit sharp decay in PnL up
    to 15 microseconds wire-to-wire.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Mid-frequency strategy**: There''s also no public convention on this term,
    but we''ll use it to refer to a relaxation of the low latency and directional
    turnover conditions as compared to a high-frequency strategy; a mid-frequency
    strategy will usually have intraday directional turnover in the order of hours
    for liquid instruments.'

- en: One of the simplest types of book feature is called the book skew, which is
    the imbalance between resting bid depth (vb​) and resting ask depth (va​) at the
    top of the book. We can formulate this as some difference between vb​ and va​
    . It's convenient to scale these by their order of magnitude, so we take their
    log differences instead.
