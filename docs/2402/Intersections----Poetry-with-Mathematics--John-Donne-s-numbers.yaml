- en: Perhaps best known for the religious themes in his poetry, John Donne (1572-1631)
    also wrote many love poems. Although the mathematics here includes only numbers,
    they are well-used to strengthen both the intensity and the precision of the work.
    [**The Primrose** ](http://www.online-literature.com/donne) by John Donne Upon
    this Primrose hill, Where, if heaven would distill A shower of rain, each several
    drop might go To his own primrose, and grow manna so; And where their form, and
    their infinity Make a terrestrial galaxy, As the small stars do in the sky; I
    walk to find a true love; and I see That 'tis not a mere woman, that is she, But
    must or more or less than woman be. Yet know I not, which flower I wish; a six,
    or four; For should my true-love less than woman be, She were scarce anything;
    and then, should she Be more than woman, she would get above All thought of sex,
    and think to move My heart to study her, and not to love. Both these were monsters;
    since there must reside Falsehood in woman, I could more abide, She were by art,
    than nature falsified. Live, primrose, then, and thrive With thy true number five;
    And, woman, whom this flower doth represent, With this mysterious number be content;
    Ten is the farthest number; if half ten Belongs to each woman, then Each woman
    may take half us men; Or—if this will not serve their turn—since all Numbers are
    odd, or even, and they fall First into five, women may take us all.
