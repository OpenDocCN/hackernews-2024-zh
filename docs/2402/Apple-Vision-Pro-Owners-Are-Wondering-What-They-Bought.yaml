- en: For some buyers, Apple Vision Pro’s most compelling use is one that Apple didn’t
    advertise. It’s a native feature of the device that allows its user to get enormous
    amounts of attention, in real life and subsequently online, by simply wearing
    it in public.

- en: For a few days, there was probably [no better bet](https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2024/02/videos-images-of-people-using-apple-vision-pro-in-public.html)
    for producing a viral video than wearing your new Vision Pro while at a restaurant,
    strutting down city streets, on the subway, or driving your Tesla. Many of these
    videos were clearly [staged or fake](https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/6/24063317/vision-pro-viral-videos-tesla-cybertruck-autopilot),
    but the overpowering novelty of the thing means that none of the rest was quite
    candid, either — it’s impossible to wear one of these things outside of your home
    without being acutely aware of your performance, at least for now.

- en: These videos meet a clear demand for evidence that Apple’s face computer is
    as ridiculous as it first looks, while simultaneously making the case for its
    inevitability. They’re funny! They’re also functionally a form of marketing, and
    not especially illuminating about how people might use mixed reality devices in
    the future, or for that matter how they’re using one now. Influencers with monetization
    schemes — professional extroverts, basically — don’t have much to tell us about
    Apple’s new introversion machine.

    other, from the privacy of their own couches, desks, rec rooms, and basements,
    where the first few hundred thousand Vision Pros are actually being tested, enjoyed,

    from the head straps or seal. In Vision Pro forums, and on social media, real
    owners are exchanging smaller, more private absurdities, discovered as they lounge
    and pad around their own homes, with, at most, occasional cameos by their families
    and friends. “[Objectively I know that I already look like a huge dork with a
    giant ski mask strapped to my face](https://www.reddit.com/r/VisionPro/comments/1ajfswg/must_have_avp_accessory/),”
    wrote a user on Reddit. “But I was still embarrassed this weekend when I had to
    stick a straw in my wine glass.” Soda cans are doable; coffee mugs are not. The
    first must-have Vision Pro accessory is a very long metal straw:'

- en: The second must-have accessory is some sort of DIY strap. Apple makes a big
    soft band that goes behind your head and a helmet-retention-system-style “dual
    loop” band that goes over your head; owners find the first one unsupportive and
    the second one uncomfortable, so they’re improvising. Zip-tying [two of the soft
    bands together](https://www.reddit.com/r/VisionPro/comments/1aj1pyh/unbelievably_comfortable_now/)
    “really allows your blood to flow around your head.” (Owners are already [sharing](https://www.reddit.com/r/VisionPro/comments/1ajt71x/dual_solo_band_adapter_clip_now_available_as_a_3d/)
    3-D-printing templates for fabricating more permanent double-strap solutions.)
    One guy put together a system for suspending his Vision Pro from a hat brim, for
    “[h]igher fov (field of view), better weight distribution,” and “open periphery”
    (one common complaint about Vision Pro is that using its cameras [can feel](https://arc.net/l/quote/wwyhjvle)
    like “looking through binoculars”).

    more poignant than off-putting. Each excited or bewildered observation posted
    from within the helmet implies, instead, a series of gently absurd vignettes,
    observed by nobody: a user sitting on the edge of his bed for hours, pinching
    his fingers in the air; a man at a desk missing the rim of his cup with his lips
    before clonking it into his headset; a guy “holding” a video in front of his face,

    for me. Only time I sit up are when there’s a need to (watching stuff in immersive
    environments) and exploring with putting windows around my house and stuff. Laying
    down is the way to go IMO. Head propped up sofa armrest/pillow.

    Is the Vision Pro for watching movies? Working? Being alone? Collaborating? Nobody
    knows, really. Rather than settling into a new routine, or building a workflow
    around their new computers, users spend a lot of time talking in the future tense,
    about what this thing might do once there are more apps, or once it’s [smaller
    and lighter and better](https://www.reddit.com/r/VisionPro/comments/1akafbg/curious_what_peoples_thoughts_are_on_the_possible/),
    or once it’s normalized among the broader population. More than a few users are
    writing reviews along the lines of, “this is a really amazing device that blew
    my mind when I first used it,” and it “has SO much promise,” while also declaring
    their intention to return it after a few days.

    product category, this perhaps isn’t the *ideal* response. It calls to mind to
    the era of consumer technology just before the iPhone came out, when various manufacturers
    were still figuring out what to do with nascent touchscreen technology, slow but
    functional mobile internet connections, shrinking hard drives and processors;
    like Taco Bell rearranges the same dozen ingredients into new menu items every
    few years, consumer tech companies were releasing seemingly randomized permutations
    of Things With Batteries And Screens, assuming that at some point one of them
    would stick. The way people are talking about the Vision Pro now is a lot like
    how early adopters talked about [portable personal-media players](https://gizmodo.com/cowon-q5w-divx-gps-pmp-review-verdict-fantastic-330497)

    hindsight had a lot to tell us about what was coming, but which were, at the time,
    mostly interesting as *gadgets* — as tools, sure, but mostly as objects of fascination
    for enthusiasts, who relish above all the feeling, whether or not it’s rooted
    in reality, that they’re exploring some sort of (controlled, consumerist, expensive)

    “I haven’t had such joy to experience new piece of technology since the original
    iPod back in 2001.” For early adopters, the pointlessness is sort of the point.
