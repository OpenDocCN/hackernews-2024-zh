- en: '*The Legend of Zelda: Link’s Awakening* has been a Nintendo classic for so
    long that it’s easy to forget how weird it felt when it dropped for the Game Boy
    in 1993\. Originally conceived as a straightforward port of the Super Nintendo’s
    *A Link to the Past* — which itself had been a return to the mean after 1987’s
    divisive sidescroller *Zelda II: The Adventure of Link* — *Link’s Awakening* could
    have been a safe, solid extension of a proven Nintendo brand, like the Game Boy
    versions of *Mega Man*, *Metroid*, or *Castlevania* that preceded it.'

  zh: '*《塞尔达传说：林克的觉醒》* 长久以来一直是任天堂的经典作品，以至于人们很容易忘记在1993年为Game Boy发售时它是多么奇怪。最初构想为超级任天堂游戏《塞尔达传说：时之笛》的直接移植——本身是在1987年备受争议的侧向卷轴游戏《塞尔达传说
    II：林克冒险》之后回归平均——《林克的觉醒》本可以成为一个稳定的、经过验证的任天堂品牌的扩展，就像它之前的Game Boy版本的《洛克人》、《银河战士》或《恶魔城》那样。'
- en: While its gameplay closely resembles *A Link to the Past*, *Link’s Awakening*
    is something stranger. The journey is set not in the kingdom of Hyrule like the
    rest of the games, but on a mysterious island whose most prominent landmark is
    a mountain with a giant spotted egg on it. Apart from Link, no major characters
    — including series villain Ganon and the eponymous Princess Zelda — appear in
    this *Zelda* game.

  zh: 虽然其游戏方式与《塞尔达传说：时光之笛》非常相似，《林克的觉醒》却更加奇异。这次的冒险不是发生在海尔王国，而是在一个神秘岛屿上，其最显著的地标是一个带有巨大斑点蛋的山。除了林克之外，没有主要角色——包括系列反派加侬和主角公主塞尔达——出现在这款《塞尔达传说》游戏中。

    is too socially awkward for an in-person conversation but endlessly chatty whenever
    you call him on the phone, a friendly shopkeeper who turns homicidal if you steal
    anything, and a whole family of fourth-wall breakers — including a dad who warns
    you he’ll get lost in the mountains later in the game (he does) and a gaggle of
    identical kids who give straightforward gameplay tips and then admit they have
    no idea what they’ve just said. Also there’s a guy who calls himself Tarin but
    is clearly just a barely disguised riff on Mario; by the end of the game, you’ve
    helped him track down a mushroom and seen him turn into a raccoon.'

    it’s easy to imagine how that legendary TV drama, co-created by Mark Frost and
    David Lynch — which begins as a mystery about the murder of a high school girl
    before spiraling into a surreal drama packed with eccentric characters and detours
    into the supernatural — might have bled into the *Zelda* franchise as well.

    storytelling that he had some suggestions. “I’d played lots of *Dungeons & Dragons*
    when I was young, so I was familiar with the kind of story they were thinking
    about,” he says. “I think I said, ‘Don’t be afraid to use dreamlike, Jungian symbolism.

- en: As for the *Twin Peaks* game Frost mentioned — despite [write-ups in several
    video game magazines at the time](http://www.nesworld.com/mirror/nr.php), it never
    materialized, though what little information came out sounded awfully ambitious
    for an NES game. [A blurb in *Nintendo Power*](https://readcomiconline.li/Comic/Nintendo-Power/Issue-22?id=50371&readType=1)
    said it would be “role playing in style” with a plot based on the show’s second
    season, complete with multiple playable characters and endings. Last year, *Time

    Power》的预告中，这款作品描述为“角色扮演风格”，包含着秀选自节目第二季的剧情，将会提供多个可玩角色和结局。后来，Time Extension的Jack

- en: But even if a *Twin Peaks* game never happened, its influence spread far beyond
    *Zelda* to games like *Alan Wake* and *Life is Strange*. Most notorious is *Deadly

    on the spot. “Featuring grisly murders, skull-shaped gas masks, and strange little
    men sitting in vibrating chairs,” he reads, clearly bemused. But the trailer itself

- en: But if *Deadly Premonition* is basically the video game equivalent of a *Twin
    Peaks* cover band, *Zelda*, over the years, has evolved into the video game franchise
    that channels an essential quality *Twin Peaks* has at its core. The best *Zelda*
    games, including *Link’s Awakening*, *Majora’s Mask*, and *Breath of the Wild*,
    balance their offbeat humor and characters with something darker. There’s an undercurrent
    of menace under those colorful fantasy trappings, and a sense that even the most
    courageous and determined hero can only hope, at best, to hold back the darkness
    for a little while.

  zh: 但如果《Deadly Premonition》基本上是《Twin Peaks》乐队的视频游戏版本，那么多年来《Zelda》的发展则塑造了一个将《Twin

    of the Wild》等，都巧妙地结合了离奇幽默与角色元素，同时也暗藏着深层的黑暗。这些游戏的绚丽幻想外衣之下，潜藏着一股令人不安的气息，即便再勇敢、再坚定不移的英雄，也只能希望在短时间内与黑暗抗争。
