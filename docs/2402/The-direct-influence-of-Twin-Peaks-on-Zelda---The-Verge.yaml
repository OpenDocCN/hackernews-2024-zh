- en: '*The Legend of Zelda: Link’s Awakening* has been a Nintendo classic for so
    long that it’s easy to forget how weird it felt when it dropped for the Game Boy
    in 1993\. Originally conceived as a straightforward port of the Super Nintendo’s
    *A Link to the Past* — which itself had been a return to the mean after 1987’s
    divisive sidescroller *Zelda II: The Adventure of Link* — *Link’s Awakening* could
    have been a safe, solid extension of a proven Nintendo brand, like the Game Boy
    versions of *Mega Man*, *Metroid*, or *Castlevania* that preceded it.'

    is something stranger. The journey is set not in the kingdom of Hyrule like the
    rest of the games, but on a mysterious island whose most prominent landmark is
    a mountain with a giant spotted egg on it. Apart from Link, no major characters
    — including series villain Ganon and the eponymous Princess Zelda — appear in
    this *Zelda* game.

    is too socially awkward for an in-person conversation but endlessly chatty whenever
    you call him on the phone, a friendly shopkeeper who turns homicidal if you steal
    anything, and a whole family of fourth-wall breakers — including a dad who warns
    you he’ll get lost in the mountains later in the game (he does) and a gaggle of
    identical kids who give straightforward gameplay tips and then admit they have
    no idea what they’ve just said. Also there’s a guy who calls himself Tarin but
    is clearly just a barely disguised riff on Mario; by the end of the game, you’ve
    helped him track down a mushroom and seen him turn into a raccoon.'

    inspiration for this memorably bizarre cast of characters. “At the time, *Twin
    Peaks* was rather popular. The drama was all about a small number of characters
    in a small town,” [Tezuka said](https://www.nintendo.co.uk/Iwata-Asks/Iwata-Asks-The-Legend-of-Zelda-Spirit-Tracks/Iwata-Asks-Zelda-Handheld-History-/3-Make-All-Characters-Suspicious-Types/3-Make-All-Characters-Suspicious-Types-233845.html).
    “So I wanted to make something like that, while it would be small enough in scope
    to easily understand, it would have deep and distinctive characteristics.”

    York Times* ran [a lengthy story about it](https://www.nytimes.com/1992/08/02/movies/film-export-news-twin-peaks-mania-peaks-in-japan.html),
    it’s easy to imagine how that legendary TV drama, co-created by Mark Frost and
    David Lynch — which begins as a mystery about the murder of a high school girl
    before spiraling into a surreal drama packed with eccentric characters and detours
    into the supernatural — might have bled into the *Zelda* franchise as well.

    logged onto X and casually dropped a bombshell that lit up two totally different
    but equally passionate fandoms. “Anybody ever play this?” he tweeted in response
    to a story about how Nintendo’s Game Boy classic *The Legend of Zelda: Link’s
    Awakening* was inspired by *Twin Peaks*.“I met with them about it and gave them
    some ideas, never tried it myself.”'

    understood as one of indirect influence. Now, Frost reveals in an interview with
    *The Verge*, he actually spoke with Nintendo about the *Zelda* franchise. “I don’t
    want to overstate it. It was a single conversation. But it was fun,” he tells
    me.

    when *Twin Peaks* fever was arguably at its hottest. “I remember meeting someone
    who was kind of their resident engineering genius,” Frost says. “He had hyperhidrosis,
    so his hands were really sweaty, and he was continually wiping his palms all through
    the meeting.”

    at the time,” says Frost. “They said, ‘One of the things we love about your show
    is how there’s all sorts of sideways associations that can drive the story forward.’
    They asked me about that as they were thinking about expanding the *Zelda* universe.”

    storytelling that he had some suggestions. “I’d played lots of *Dungeons & Dragons*
    when I was young, so I was familiar with the kind of story they were thinking
    about,” he says. “I think I said, ‘Don’t be afraid to use dreamlike, Jungian symbolism.
    Things can connect thematically without having to connect concretely.’ It was
    things like that that I was urging them [to consider].”

    for *Link’s Awakening*’s story, including the climactic revelation — 30-year-old
    spoiler alert — that the entire game has been a dream. But it’s not hard to draw
    connections between the murder mystery and the then-weirdest *Zelda* game, with
    its bizarre characters, dreams full of hidden messages, and [an owl that’s not

- en: As for the *Twin Peaks* game Frost mentioned — despite [write-ups in several
    video game magazines at the time](http://www.nesworld.com/mirror/nr.php), it never
    materialized, though what little information came out sounded awfully ambitious
    for an NES game. [A blurb in *Nintendo Power*](https://readcomiconline.li/Comic/Nintendo-Power/Issue-22?id=50371&readType=1)
    said it would be “role playing in style” with a plot based on the show’s second
    season, complete with multiple playable characters and endings. Last year, *Time
    Extension*’s Jack Yarwood tracked down a former producer at license holder Hi
    Tech Expressions, who confirmed that an ambitious-sounding *Twin Peaks* game inspired
    by *Maniac Mansion* was discussed but never went into production.

    *Zelda* to games like *Alan Wake* and *Life is Strange*. Most notorious is *Deadly
    Premonition*, originally announced as *Rainy Woods* with a trailer so obviously
    inspired by Frost and Lynch’s show that it feels closer to remake than homage.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When I ask Frost if he’s ever seen the *Rainy Woods* trailer, he pulled it up
    on the spot. “Featuring grisly murders, skull-shaped gas masks, and strange little
    men sitting in vibrating chairs,” he reads, clearly bemused. But the trailer itself
    didn’t bother him. “I’ve never complained about that sort of homage. You can’t
    copyright a mood, after all,” Frost says.

- en: I’ve thought a lot about the “*Twin Peaks* mood” since that conversation. Much
    has been made, correctly, of *Twin Peaks*’ outsized impact on television. You
    can see echoes of it in everything from Tony Soprano’s cryptic, revelatory dreams
    to blatant knockoffs like AMC’s *The Killing*, with its ubiquitous “Who Killed
    Rosie Larsen?” campaign.

- en: But if *Deadly Premonition* is basically the video game equivalent of a *Twin
    Peaks* cover band, *Zelda*, over the years, has evolved into the video game franchise
    that channels an essential quality *Twin Peaks* has at its core. The best *Zelda*
    games, including *Link’s Awakening*, *Majora’s Mask*, and *Breath of the Wild*,
    balance their offbeat humor and characters with something darker. There’s an undercurrent
    of menace under those colorful fantasy trappings, and a sense that even the most
    courageous and determined hero can only hope, at best, to hold back the darkness
    for a little while.
