    about how the essential quality of secularization is the transition from what
    he calls “the porous self” to “the buffered self.” In pretty much every premodern

    simply alien influence from external forces and entities — gods, demons, faeries,
    curses, the evil eye, or *[Iwa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haitian_Vodou#Spirit_possession)*.
    Contra many popularizers of Taylor, the crucial distinction isn’t that these forces

    —— 诸如神灵、恶魔、仙女、诅咒、邪眼，或者*[伊瓦](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haitian_Vodou#Spirit_possession)*。与泰勒的许多普及者相反，关键区别并非在于这些力量是超自然的性质，而在于最内心和外界之间的边界模糊和半透明，因此我们的任何一个想法或欲望都可能是外部影响的结果。
- en: 'In contrast, most modern societies believe in a self that is “buffered.” In
    this view there are a few limited, low-bandwidth ways that the external world
    can act on one’s innate nature, for instance via drugs or other body chemistry,
    and even these are often seen as revealing or disclosing previously hidden innate
    characteristics of one’s personality rather than as imposing something alien.
    Taylor argues quite convincingly that these two ways of viewing the self — porous
    vs. buffered — inexorably produce two different ways of viewing society and the
    world: premodern and modern. For example: if selves are porous, then we need to
    be extremely vigilant against the invasion or violation of our minds by hostile
    spirits, and we must be suspicious of what we want, because it might not really
    be what we want, but rather what *something else* wants through us. Conversely,
    if selves are buffered then our desires are just part of who we are, and in order
    to be true to ourselves, we need to explore them and act upon them.'

    —— 多孔性和缓冲性 —— 不可避免地导致了对社会和世界的两种不同看法：前现代和现代。例如：如果自我是多孔的，那么我们就需要极度警惕敌意精神侵入或侵犯我们的思想，并且我们必须怀疑我们想要的东西，因为它可能并不是我们真正想要的，而是通过我们的*某些其他东西*想要的。相反，如果自我是缓冲的，那么我们的欲望只是我们的一部分，为了忠于自己，我们需要探索并行动。

- en: 'Dostoevsky obligingly gives us a character who’s clearly possessed in exactly
    this sense — a dissolute nobleman around whom the various radical conspiracies
    swirl. He is, simultaneously, a subversion of the brooding Byronic hero archetype
    that was so popular in 19th century European literature, and an eerie anticipation
    of the modern concept of the serial killer. How did he get this way? Remember
    the modern view of our desires is that they come from within us, and indulging
    them leads to inner harmony. But the older and truer view is that they can come
    from outside, force their way into our skulls through an opening, set their hooks
    in our brains, lay their eggs. These fledgling desires start out small and weak,
    but to indulge them is to feed them, grow them, until they take over their host
    and move its mouth and limbs around like a puppet. In this sense the porn addict,
    the drug addict, and the rage addict are all alike: sensual dissipation gets boring
    eventually, and you need harder and harder stuff to feel the same thrill, until
    one day you reach for something so hard you lose yourself forever.'

  zh: 陀思妥耶夫斯基恰如其分地给了我们一个明显被这种意义所占据的角色 —— 一个被各种激进阴谋围绕的放荡贵族。他同时也是对19世纪欧洲文学中风靡的忧郁拜伦式英雄原型的颠覆，以及对现代连环杀手概念的不祥预感。他为什么会变成这样？记住我们对自己欲望的现代看法是，它们来自于我们内心，放纵它们会导致内心的和谐。但更老练、更真实的看法是，它们可以来自外部，通过一个开放进入我们的头脑，把它们的钩子嵌入我们的大脑，产卵。这些新生的欲望起初微弱无力，但放纵它们就是滋养它们，使它们成长，直到它们控制了它们的宿主，像傀儡一样动弹其口和肢体。在这个意义上，色情成瘾者、药物成瘾者和愤怒成瘾者都是相似的：感官消耗最终变得无聊，你需要越来越强烈的东西才能感受到同样的刺激，直到有一天你伸手去抓取一些如此强烈的东西以至于永远失去自我。
- en: The Dostoevskian twist to all this is that the proto-serial killer is *far*
    more sympathetic, and ultimately more redeemable, than the revolutionaries. The
    radicals' motivations spring from the same emotional source as his, theirs are
    just sublimated into politics, which is why the form of the dystopia doesn't really
    matter to them, all that matters is that there be a boot stomping on a human face.
    The sexual sadism of the serial killer is unflinchingly portrayed as less disordered
    and less socially destructive than its political equivalent and, ultimately, as
    rather basic. It's actually quite easy to miss all of this because it's so deeply
    at odds with modern sensibilities. Not just “serial killers are better than communists
    actually,” but also “serial killers are really pretty boring actually,” and all
    from the guy who just invented serial killers.

    That’s the entire point! It wasn’t actually any of those things, it was an egregore,
    its true name was something like Melkhorbalai or Uztaa-Binoreth. It wore those
    other names like skins when it was convenient to do so, which is why in the real

    who tries lamely to stand in the way of the swirling, coalescing, immaterial malevolence.
    He is a reactionary, a newly-freed former serf, and (like Dostoevsky himself)
    a repentant former revolutionary. He’s young and hip, but has old and edgy views,
    a perfect stand-in for online “trads.” Given Dostoevsky’s own views it would be
    easy to make him the hero of the story, but Dostoevsky is too great a writer for
