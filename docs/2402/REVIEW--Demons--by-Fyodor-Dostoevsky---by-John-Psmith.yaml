    and are espousing all this *weird* stuff: stuff about white fragility and transgenderism
    and boycotting Israel, stuff that makes their nice liberal parents extremely uncomfortable.

    attitudes, but unlike in *Fathers and Sons*, the kids in *Demons* are disgusted
    by the hypocrisy and cowardice of their genteel liberal parents, and eager to
    plunge Russia into a hyper-totalitarian nightmare. The exact contours of that
    nightmare are something they frequently argue about and change their minds over,

    that everything can be solved by killing one hundred million people, but laments

    about how the essential quality of secularization is the transition from what
    he calls “the porous self” to “the buffered self.” In pretty much every premodern
    society, people believe that their psyches are subject to benign or malign or
    simply alien influence from external forces and entities — gods, demons, faeries,
    curses, the evil eye, or *[Iwa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haitian_Vodou#Spirit_possession)*.
    Contra many popularizers of Taylor, the crucial distinction isn’t that these forces
    are supernatural in nature, it’s that the boundary between inmost self and the
    outside world is vague and semi-permeable, and therefore that any one of our thoughts
    or desires might have arisen through outside influence.

    this view there are a few limited, low-bandwidth ways that the external world
    can act on one’s innate nature, for instance via drugs or other body chemistry,
    and even these are often seen as revealing or disclosing previously hidden innate
    characteristics of one’s personality rather than as imposing something alien.
    Taylor argues quite convincingly that these two ways of viewing the self — porous
    vs. buffered — inexorably produce two different ways of viewing society and the
    world: premodern and modern. For example: if selves are porous, then we need to
    be extremely vigilant against the invasion or violation of our minds by hostile
    spirits, and we must be suspicious of what we want, because it might not really
    be what we want, but rather what *something else* wants through us. Conversely,
    if selves are buffered then our desires are just part of who we are, and in order
    to be true to ourselves, we need to explore them and act upon them.'

    rather basic. It's actually quite easy to miss all of this because it's so deeply

    radicals are blowing up Mt. Rushmore and pulling down statues of George Washington.
    Who are these radicals? I have no idea what the egregore will call itself this
    time. It doesn’t matter. Its true name sounds to human ears like a high-pitched
    mechanical screeching and clicking, a sound calculated to drive men mad, and to
    drive madmen into making it real.
