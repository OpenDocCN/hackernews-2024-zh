- en: This course will effectively provide the best possible foundations of semiconductor
    fabrication to boost innovation, continuous improvement, and critical thinking.
    This will also enable you to identify the important factors, prioritize them,
    explore factor interactions, and determine robust solutions within the given context
    and resources. Very importantly it will let you learn not only by reading or listening,
    but it will also allow you to practice your understanding in the virtual cleanroom
    at your convenience from anywhere using any of your gadgets. [Register here](https://www.eventreg.purdue.edu/ec2k/courselisting.aspx?1=%20&master_ID=6388%20&course_area=1285%20&course_number=133%20&course_subtitle=00)
