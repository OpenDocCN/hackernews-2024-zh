- en: The U.S Energy Information Administration (EIA) is now requiring large-scale
    commercial cryptocurrency mining operations to report their power consumption.
    This initiative is part of a larger effort to regulate and penalize cryptocurrency
    mining due to the exorbitant amount of energy the industry consumes yearly. For
    now, the EIA is only collecting data, but this new data should give birth to new
    regulations that will penalize miners in the future. This comes as the company
    has [released a study](https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=61364)
    (first reported on by [*Inside Climate News*](https://insideclimatenews.org/news/06022024/todays-climate-cryptocurrency-energy-information-administration-energy-use-climate-change/))
    suggesting that cryptocurrency mining represents up to 2.3% of U.S. power demand.

    cryptocurrency mining activities in the United States...,” EIA administratior
    Joe DeCarolis [said in a release in January](https://www.eia.gov/pressroom/releases/press550.php).
    “We will specifically focus on how the energy demand for cryptocurrency mining
    is evolving, identify geographic areas of high growth, and quantify the sources
    of electricity used to meet cryptocurrency mining demand.”

- en: DeCarolis' words summarize that the United States will pay close attention to
    the environmental challenges cryptocurrency mining might be causing. We can surmise
    that the United States government specifically wants to crack down on mining operations
    that impact the reliability and sustainability of power in highly populated areas.
    Potentially leading to higher residential power costs and power shortage issues
    during peak hours. As of January 2024, the EIA has identified 137 cryptomining
    facilities.

- en: The EIA found that crypto-mining operations in the United States has grown substantially
    over the past few years, to the point where all U.S-based crypto-mining operations
    consume 0.6% to 2.3% of the nation's entire electricity consumption alone. For
    comparison, the total U.S. Bitcoin mining industry consumes the annual power budget
    of Utah or West Virginia. The estimated power draw of Bitcoin mining worldwide
    is projected to be anywhere between 0.2% to 0.9% of global demand, equating to
    the same power draw as Greece or Australia by themselves.

    the exorbitant amount of mining that actually takes place within U.S borders.
    The EIA found that the global share of Bitcoin mining that takes place in the
    U.S. grew from 3.4% in 2020 to a whopping 37.8% in 2022.

- en: The incredible power demands of the Bitcoin industry are a result of the Bitcoin
    mining algorithm becoming more and more difficult every single year. Bitcoin today
    isn't what it was eight to ten years ago, where you could mine it on a single
    computer and net a decent profit. Nowadays, Bitcoin needs to be mined on hundreds
    of specialized mining devices (ASICs) to be gathered at all. The continuous difficulty
    of the Bitcoin algorithm, in turn, creates higher and higher power costs as the
    cryptocurrency gets harder to mine.

    2024 is expected to be one of the most eventful years in Bitcoin history, with
    the cryptocurrency expected to blow past its record $69,000 high sometime after
    its halving event in April (when the reward for Bitcoin mining is cut in half)
    thanks to reduced mining profit and large-scale institutional adoption.
