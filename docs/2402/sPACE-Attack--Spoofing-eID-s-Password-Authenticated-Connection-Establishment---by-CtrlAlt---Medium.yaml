- en: To demonstrate the practical exploitability of the vulnerability, a bank account
    has been successfully opened in the name of a victim at a major German bank. As
    a result, the attacker has access to the newly established bank account owned
    by the victim. It is important to note that the victim used a smartphone updated
    to the latest version with all patches installed and followed all security recommendations
    provided by the BSI. No physical access or remote code execution was required.

- en: The victim is a German citizen who owns an iPhone and a German ID card equipped
    with activated eID functionality. The victim intends to use the eID to access
    the official portal of the Arbeitsagentur (refer to [https://www.arbeitsagentur.de/](https://www.arbeitsagentur.de/)).
    To do so, the victim visited the official Apple app store and downloaded the official
    AusweisApp.

- en: At a certain point of the login process, there is a redirection (“deeplink”)
    to the AusweisApp, where the eID authentication is intended to take place. As
    show in the research paper, both Apple’s and Google’s deeplink behavior, combined
    with the approach the eID uses for deeplinks, can be utilized by an attacker to
    redirect to another app.

- en: As a result of this deeplink vulnerability in the eID, an app containing a modified
    eID kernel, uploaded to the official app store by the attacker, was triggered.
    Importantly, this does not require any permissions, no remote code execution or
    physical access.

    connections from victims. Upon the victim’s initiation of the modified eID kernel
    within the malicious app, a connection is established to the attacker’s system.
    The attacker system responds to this connection by initiating the bank account
    opening process at the bank.

    access to the newly created bank account associated with the victim.
