    high levels of ["forever chemicals" or PFAS,](https://www.greenmatters.com/big-impact/pfas-forever-chemicals-research)
    meaning that eating kale could have just gone from healthy to potentially dangerous.

    [seven out of eight kale samples](https://anh-usa.org/report-release-why-is-pfas-in-my-kale/)
    taken from grocery stores in the U.S. contained concerning levels of PFAS.

    by the results](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/30/kale-pfas-forever-chemicals-contamination),
    expecting to find very low levels. This reaction was largely based on the fact
    that between 2019 and 2021, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), tested store-bought
    kale in the U.S. and found no traces of PFAS.

    lab, using the same methods as the FDA. Kale was tested from Whole Foods, Weis,
    Publix, and Stop & Shop. Some well-known brands that contained PFAS were Palmetto
    Gardens, By Nature, GreenWise, and Nature's Promise Organic. Only one sample had
    zero levels of PFAS, which was loose kale from Baker Farms.

    ANH is known for a few controversial viewpoints — its mission is to promote alternative
    medicine and dietary supplements, and eschew much mainstream medicine. The organization
    also publishes many [anti-vaccine articles](https://anh-usa.org/?s=vaccine).

    often used in manufacturing everyday products to resist oil, grease, water, heat,
    and stains. They can be found in much of our clothing, cookware, fabrics, and

    PFAS don't break down, and are able to build up in the environment, as well as
    in people and animals. This is especially concerning, as research has shown that
    even low exposure to PFAS can lead to serious health issues in humans and animals,
    per the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR).
