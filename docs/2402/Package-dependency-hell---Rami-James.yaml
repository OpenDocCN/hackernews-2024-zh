- en: Package managers like npm give you quick and easy access to their ecosystem
    of functionality. Unfortunately, the ease with which you can quickly add packages
    to a project inflates the complexity you inherit. You save some time by using
    someone else’s code, but you pay an unknown price in the future. It’s up to the
    upstream package maintainer. If they update and break something in your stack,
    it’s on you to update it. Your code may work today, but the likelihood that it
    will work as-is in five years is fairly low. With enough packages imported, you
    will spend a lot of energy trying to stay up-to-date. It’s a nightmare. The energy
    you spend doing maintenance is instead of creating new functionality. A pretty
    high price, I would argue.

    on your own. Let’s face it, though: building everything from the ground up is
    incredibly hard and beyond the reach of most developers. If you just want to get
    some project up and running, you bite the bullet and accept that for its lifetime,
    you will be trading your time for your lack of deep expertise. You''re now trapped
    in dependency hell. Better get comfortable because you''re going to be here a
    while.'

    to your life that you're expected to follow. Today, I believe this roadmap is
    largely not for your benefit but is a way to produce competent indentured servants
    for the market economy. You learn, you work, you breed, and you die. You don’t
    do it for you; you do it for the “greater good.” You do it to be useful.

- en: Most of us get some good things out of adding these dependencies, but the price
    we collectively pay in exchange is a society full of constant, mindless toil.
    Every package we add is another layer of complexity and maintenance. We are trapped
    in this dependency cycle because we are too poor, disinterested, timid, scared,
    or exhausted to acquire the skills that allow us to be fully independent. We don't
    need all those packages, but we added them because we were told that is how things
    are done. Most people aren’t very thoughtful about what dependencies they add
    to their lives. Once you have them, you have to deal with them.

    arbitrary. I didn't understand that adding packages is optional. I added too many
    and couldn’t handle the stress of maintaining so much. I just did what the roadmap
    told me to do. It all felt wrong, but I played along until I couldn’t handle it
    all anymore.

    you spend every month. You're supposed to slowly accrue value over your lifetime
    and retire close to 70\. I don’t think my generation (and those who came after)
    believe we will retire. We’re all getting screwed. It was true for my parents.
    My mom died at 54, so she got screwed one way. My dad is still working at 82,
    so he got screwed in another way. It doesn't add up for me. I want to avoid ending
    up like them.

    do it anymore. Every job that I take, I quit. I'm burned out and feel like I've
    got nothing left. I want to refrain from participating in a system that falsely
    promises security in exchange for our energy, creativity, and happiness. My very
    essence has been siphoned off. It’s all gone to maintaining packages that other
    people keep updating.
