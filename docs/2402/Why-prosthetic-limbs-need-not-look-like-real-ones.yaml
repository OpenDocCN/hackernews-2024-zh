- en: In a photoshoot Kelly Knox—a British model and disability-rights advocate—poses
    with a prosthetic limb unlike any other. Ms Knox was born with her left arm missing
    from the elbow down. From the point her arm terminates, dozens of vertebrae-like
    structures extend to form a long, sinuous tentacle.

- en: The limb is certainly striking. It is dextrous, too. Ms Knox can control its
    movements via pressure sensors in her shoes, which connect to the limb wirelessly.
    Artificial tendons can tighten or loosen, allowing the tentacle to reach and grasp.
    The limb—detached from Ms Knox and titled VINE 2.0—is due to go on display at
    “BODIES…The Exhibition*”* at the Luxor, a hotel and casino in Las Vegas, later
    this year.
