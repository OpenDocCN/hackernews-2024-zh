Variety of the English language

**Antarctic English** is a variety of the [English language](/wiki/English_language "English language") spoken by people living on the continent of [Antarctica](/wiki/Antarctica "Antarctica") and within the [subantarctic islands](/wiki/Subantarctic_islands "Subantarctic islands").^([[1]](#cite_note-:1-1))^(: vii ) Spoken primarily by [scientists](/wiki/Scientist "Scientist") and workers in the [Antarctic tourism industry](/wiki/Tourism_in_Antarctica "Tourism in Antarctica"),^([[2]](#cite_note-:0-2)) it consists of various unique words and is spoken with a unique [accent](/wiki/Accent_(sociolinguistics) "Accent (sociolinguistics)"). During the 19th and 20th centuries, Antarctic English was influenced by Spanish-speaking [South Americans](/wiki/South_America "South America") and [Northern European](/wiki/Northern_Europe "Northern Europe") explorers who introduced new words that continue to be used today.

## History[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Antarctic_English&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: History")]

In 1989, Australian writer Bernadette Hince travelled to Antarctica in order to study the vocabulary of scientists working there. She wrote about a variety of unique words that originated on the continent and were not used anywhere else on earth. In 2000, she published the *Antarctic Dictionary*, a book detailing the words found in the dialect.^([[2]](#cite_note-:0-2))

An Antarctic accent was first studied in 2019 in the *[Journal of the Acoustical Society of America](/wiki/Journal_of_the_Acoustical_Society_of_America "Journal of the Acoustical Society of America")*, in a study in which researchers observed changes in the vocal phonetics of scientists over the course of a winter period in Antarctica. They observed a change in vowel pronunciation in the scientists, and the vowels in words such as "food" and "window" began being pronounced in a more fronted position of the mouth than in other English varieties.^([[3]](#cite_note-3))^([[4]](#cite_note-4))^([[5]](#cite_note-5))^([[6]](#cite_note-6))

## Vocabulary[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Antarctic_English&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Vocabulary")]

Antarctic English features various words that are different from other varieties of English. Differences in vocabulary include:

Example Antarctic English terms

| British English | Antarctic English | Ref. |
| *Antarctica* | *The Ice* | ^([[2]](#cite_note-:0-2)) |
| *[Homebrew](/wiki/Homebrewing "Homebrewing") beer* | *Homer* | ^([[2]](#cite_note-:0-2)) |
| *[Insomnia](/wiki/Insomnia "Insomnia")* | *Big Eye* | ^([[2]](#cite_note-:0-2)) |
| *Picking up rubbish* | *Fod plod* | ^([[7]](#cite_note-:2-7)) |
| *Clear day with blue skies* | *Dingle day* | ^([[7]](#cite_note-:2-7)) |
| *Tea time* | *Smoko* | ^([[7]](#cite_note-:2-7)) |
| *Sleep* | *Gonk* | ^([[7]](#cite_note-:2-7)) |

Antarctic English also has over 200 words for different types of ice. Words include *tabulars* (large flat-topped southern icebergs that break off from the Antarctic ice sheet and are usually over 16 km or 10 mi long), and *growlers* (underwater decaying icebergs roughly the size of a house).^([[2]](#cite_note-:0-2)) In addition, the tourism industry has terms for different types of tourist encounters, such as *[Kodak](/wiki/Kodak "Kodak") poisoning* (what happens when many tourists take photographs of the same site) and *Dead-[Penguin](/wiki/Penguin "Penguin") Tours* (a type of tour in the late summer after penguins have abandoned weak chicks to die, leaving their bodies in popular tourist destinations, which causes grief in tourists).^([[2]](#cite_note-:0-2))

### Influences from other languages[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Antarctic_English&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Influences from other languages")]

Antarctic English has been influenced by both Spanish and various Northern European languages.^([[1]](#cite_note-:1-1))^(: vii–viii ) In the [Falkland Islands](/wiki/Falkland_Islands "Falkland Islands"), Antarctic English has been influenced by Spanish-speaking South Americans, such as with the word *[camp](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/camp#Etymology_3 "wikt:camp")*, which originates from the Spanish [*campo*](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/campo#Spanish "wikt:campo") and refers to the countryside outside of a town.^([[1]](#cite_note-:1-1))^(: vii ) During the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, Northern European industrialists interested in whaling and the fur trade introduced various technical words like the Norwegian-origin [*grax*](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/grax "wikt:grax"), which describes the leftover solids at the end of the [whaling process](/wiki/Whaling "Whaling").^([[1]](#cite_note-:1-1))^(: viii ) Other words introduced by these Europeans during the 19th and 20th centuries included *[nunatak](/wiki/Nunatak "Nunatak")*, *[mukluk](/wiki/Mukluk "Mukluk")*, *[pemmican](/wiki/Pemmican "Pemmican")*, and [*Nansen* sled](/wiki/Nansen_sled "Nansen sled"),^([[1]](#cite_note-:1-1))^(: viii ) which they in turn adopted from various indigenous American languages. Some terms in Antarctic English have their origins in [military terminology](/wiki/Military_terminology "Military terminology").^([[7]](#cite_note-:2-7))

## Influence[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Antarctic_English&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Influence")]

Antarctic English has also influenced other varieties of English and a number of [Arctic English](/w/index.php?title=Arctic_English&action=edit&redlink=1 "Arctic English (page does not exist)") terms were first adopted in Antarctica (particularly terms relating to ice).^([[1]](#cite_note-:1-1))^(: viii )
