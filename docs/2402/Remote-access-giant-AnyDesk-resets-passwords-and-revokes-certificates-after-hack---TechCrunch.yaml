    which have long used the software for gaining and maintaining access to a victim’s
    computer and data. U.S. cybersecurity agency CISA said in January that [hackers
    had compromised federal agencies using legitimate remote desktop software](https://techcrunch.com/2023/01/26/us-federal-agencies-hacked-remote-access-tools/),

    a days-long outage, AnyDesk [confirmed in a statement](https://anydesk.com/en/public-statement)

- en: AnyDesk has already faced criticism for its handling of the cyberattack so far.
    As [first reported by German blogger Günter Born](https://www.borncity.com/blog/2024/02/01/anydesk-und-die-stoerungen-es-ist-womoeglich-was-im-busch/),
    AnyDesk [initially claimed](https://twitter.com/anydesk/status/1752422327109746944)
    the four days of disruption starting January 29, during which the company blocked
    users from the ability to log in, was “maintenance.” Jake Williams, a veteran
    incident responder, accused AnyDesk in [a post on X](https://twitter.com/MalwareJake/status/1753550354958967113)
    of pulling a “PR move” by disclosing the cyberattack to customers just before
    the weekend.

    affected by the breach on known cybercrime forums, but also note that the stolen
    account details are likely sourced from previous malware infections involving
    password-stealing malware on a user’s computer.
