    with the present. Economists and psychologists have long studied the phenomenon
    of discounting, according to which we value something right now more highly than
    we value the idea of having the same item in, say, a year’s time. This is one
    of the reasons we demand interest on money we put away in a savings account, and
    also why lottery winners will accept a lower lump-sum payout today over staggered
    payments that will amount to a larger sum in the future.

  zh: 我的问题是双重的。第一个是没有适当地评估未来与现在的价值。经济学家和心理学家长期以来一直研究贴现现象，根据这一现象，我们更高地评估眼前的东西，而不是一年后拥有同样物品的想法。这是我们要求在储蓄账户中存钱时要求利息的原因之一，也是为什么彩票得主会选择今天的较低总额支付，而不是未来更高总额的分期支付。

    but many people suffer from a common bias called “[hyperbolic discounting](https://thedecisionlab.com/biases/hyperbolic-discounting),”

    This explains [addictive behaviors](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/B9780080440569500439),
    in which the likelihood of future damage—from drug use, for example—is ignored
    in favor of the momentary present pleasure. Hyperbolic discounting also can help
    explain my habitually saying *yes* to some upcoming task: Future inconvenience
    is overlooked in favor of the joy available right now of saying you will take

    housing market: You really want the house but envision yourself in a few years,

    worth less than the value of your mortgage. So you rent for another year, then
    another, and so on. Risk avoidance can therefore inhibit you from saying *yes*
    to something important: owning your own home and the long-term prospect of building
    equity in it. As the author Daniel Pink notes in his book *The Power of Regret*
    (which I have [mentioned before](https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2022/02/no-regrets-learning-happiness/621458/)),
