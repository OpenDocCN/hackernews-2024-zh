    by father and privacy activist Jesper Graugaard, shows that the **Danish Data
    Protection Authority has issued an injunction** regarding the tracking of children''s
    personal data via Chromebook and Google platforms in schools.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: From 1 August 2024 onwards, Danish schools will no longer be allowed to enable
    Chromebooks and Google platforms to collect students' personal data for processing.
    Each municipality will need to give an indication of how they will comply to this
    injunction **by 1 March 2024**.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For activist Graugaard, the decision comes as a relief. He began his crusade
    against Chromebooks in school in his home town Elsinor over four years ago. While
    this week's report makes no reference to Jesper's initiatives, it is clear that
    this injunction could not have been issued without his tireless and sometimes
    solitary activism.
  prefs: []

- en: Hopefully the Danish Chromebook case's conclusion will draw attention to the
    unchecked intrusion of data mining companies into schools in other countries within
    Europe, and worldwide. It would be good to see checks on Google's dominance in
    schools, currently achieved via attractively priced hardware and free proprietary
    platforms built for this purpose.

    with an open-minded stance towards IT in schools, discovered his child's data
    was being made public via a Google account set up by the school.

    Google, for drawing attention to the misuse of students' personal data, and for
    taking action against it. His story shows that one person's critical questions
    and actions *can* impact what feels like a mammoth and immovable industry.

    The day after publication of the decision, Jesper posted a translation of an article

    Dragons* podcasts, I am skeptical about such dismissive statements from the world's
    wealthiest companies. It is often discovered after the fact that data companies
    were furtively collecting more data than promised. Listening to the news items
    on these podcasts, it also seems difficult to truly anonymise data and remove
    the potential for cross referencing with other data sets.

    to *avoid* halting the use of Chromebooks in schools.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One might be inclined to sympathise. What is wrong, after all, with making computers
    widely available in schools? But as Jesper has often pointed out to me, Danish
    schools and educational boards have known about his case and the potential illegality
    of the practice for years now, yet have made no effort to think of a 'plan B',
    should the verdict land on the side of protecting the rights of children.
  prefs: []

    all over the world. The Danish Data Protection Authority suggests that a **possible
    solution would be for Google to create a new tool that *intercepts* children's
    data before it is sent to their servers**. It is unlikely Google will want to
    develop such a tool, given they make money on personal data. However, seen from
    Google's perspective, they have already made big gains by establishing their products
    and platforms as the standard in schools worldwide.

    into local IT companies—[Magenta](https://www.magenta.dk/en/our-organization/)

    open source alternatives to the Google educational platforms.

    user-controlled Linux for schools. If the argument for the use of Chromebooks
    in schools is the low cost, well, then **there is no argument, because open source
    desktop Linux software is free**. If the concern is getting the hardware, then
    I say: Look to hardware refurbishing companies and organisations. Laptops deemed
    outdated for corporate use can *easily* be adapted for an additional five years
    of school use by installing a Linux distro on them and running free, open source
    software like **LibreOffice**. Chrome can be replaced with **Firefox and DuckDuckGo**,
    and school platforms can run on an open source platform like **Nextcloud**.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Using refurbished hardware in schools is cheap, good for the environment, creates
    new IT jobs and introduces new generations of young people to recycling and to
    open source software. If managed well, open source is secure, and light on hardware
    resources. As a teacher, I have had to use educational IT services and devices
    for many years, and I do not see a downside to using Linux for these purposes.
