- en: A few weeks ago, I got scammed buying a camera on Facebook Marketplace.
  id: totrans-split-6

- en: I bought the camera from a profile that was created in 2017\. They had some
    other things for sale, too. The account looked legit — lots of family photos and
    comments from family members.

    be protected by PayPal in case of a scam.

- en: They didn’t ship out the item that evening or the next day, so I got antsy and
    texted them. They finally sent me a UPS tracking link for my package, but then
    they immediately said they were very worried because I had opened a PayPal claim
    against them. I had not. I checked my PayPal account. *I had?* They pleaded with
    me to close it.

    So when the package arrived and was something else, I would have no recourse.

    even sent doctored screenshots of the case not showing up.

    a case on my behalf against themselves. They weren’t sure.

    email that the case had been closed. By me. By me?? I didn’t do that.

- en: I raced home and called PayPal. Again, they didn’t know how that was possible.
    But they were understanding and explained that, once the package arrived and wasn’t
    a camera, I actually could open another case. You just can’t open a case a second
    time for the *same issue*. But the scammer opened an “Item not received” case
    against themselves, and I could file again as “Item not as described.”

    at least. It was signed for by “ATWOOD.” I don’t know anyone named Atwood.

- en: I called UPS. For security reasons, they couldn’t tell me where the package
    was headed, but they did confirm that it wasn’t my address or my name. It was
    an address in Lexington though, so the UPS tracking website would show “Lexington,
    MA” (but it doesn’t show the exact address, which the scammer must’ve known).
  id: totrans-split-17

- en: I called PayPal again and explained. They took the tracking number and called
    UPS, and were somehow able to find out exactly where the package was heading.
    (This feels like it was against UPS protocol.)

    Lexington. I guess the scammer chose a random commercial address that was in Lexington.

    The scammer now had 10 days to provide evidence to the contrary, otherwise I would
    automatically be refunded.

- en: 10 days later, I woke up to see that the scammer had added a tracking number
    to the case. It was the same tracking number they had given me, the one that PayPal
    knew wasn’t headed to me, so that was perfect. I logged into PayPal, and… *I*
    had closed the case. Again. This time at 2am, while I was asleep.

- en: I spent 2.5 hours on Saturday morning calling PayPal, and eventually got to
    someone who was very helpful. I had to explain that I actually *didn’t* close
    that case. They re-opened the case for a second time, and escalated it so the
    “back-office team” could review in a few days. I just hoped that the scammer wouldn’t
    close the case on my behalf for a third time.

- en: I’m still not sure how the scammer was able to open and close cases on my behalf.
    My theory is that they were able to spoof my phone number and call PayPal support
    and do it over the phone. (They asked early on for my phone number “for the tracking
    information,” which in retrospect doesn’t make a lot of sense.)
