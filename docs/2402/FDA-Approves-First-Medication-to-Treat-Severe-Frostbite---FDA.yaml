- en: The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved Aurlumyn (iloprost) injection
    to treat severe frostbite in adults to reduce the risk of finger or toe amputation.

- en: '**“This approval provides patients with the first-ever treatment option for
    severe frostbite,” said Norman Stockbridge, M.D., Ph.D., director of the Division
    of Cardiology and Nephrology in the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research.
    “Having this new option provides physicians with a tool that will help prevent
    the lifechanging amputation of one’s frostbitten fingers or toes.” **'

- en: Frostbite can occur in several stages, ranging from mild frostbite that does
    not require medical intervention and does not cause permanent skin damage, to
    severe frostbite when both the skin and underlying tissue are frozen and blood
    flow is stopped, sometimes requiring amputation. Iloprost, the active ingredient
    in Aurlumyn, is a vasodilator (a drug that opens blood vessels) and prevents blood
    from clotting.

- en: Iloprost’s efficacy in treating severe frostbite was primarily established in
    an open-label, controlled [trial](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc1000538)
    that randomized 47 adults with severe frostbite, who all received aspirin by vein
    and standard of care, into one of three treatment groups. One of these groups
    (Group 1) received iloprost by vein (intravenously) for 6 hours daily for up to
    8 days. The two other groups received other medications that are unapproved for
    frostbite, given with iloprost (Group 2) or without iloprost (Group 3). The primary
    measure of efficacy was a bone scan obtained 7 days after initial frostbite that
    was used to predict the need for amputation of at least one finger or toe.

- en: On day 7, the bone scan finding predictive of needing amputation was observed
    in 0% (0 of 16) patients receiving iloprost alone (Group 1) compared to 19% (3
    of 16) patients in Group 2 and 60% (9 of 15) patients in Group 3\. The presence
    of the bone scan abnormality was significantly lower in the two groups receiving
    iloprost. Most patients had follow-up information on whether they subsequently
    underwent at least one finger or toe amputation. The need for amputation was consistent
    with the bone scan findings.

- en: The most common side effects of Aurlumyn include headache, flushing, heart palpitations,
    fast heart rate, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, and hypotension (blood pressure
    that is too low). Aurlumyn also has a warning and precaution noting that it may
    cause symptomatic hypotension.
