    covered this luminary who studied physics at Nanjing University and earned a Ph.D.
    in Nuclear Engineering and Radiological Sciences from the University of Michigan.

    50 1080ti GPUs to build a computing cluster for training large-scale models for
    breast cancer image detection.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    and brain tumor delineation.

    offering them completely free of charge.

    their gratitude, saying that coolwulf's free website helped them confirm cancerous

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Because research related to cancer might only be fully appreciated by clinical
    physicists in oncology. Ordinary people, likely including myself, would probably
    be baffled by the details.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    time to hold a video conference, sharing his screen and educating me for an entire
    morning.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    finally came to understand it clearly.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Different from two years ago, the new platform brought by coolwulf, NeuralRad,
    has updated the whole body organ segmentation function.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It takes only about ten minutes to automatically segment the whole body organs
    with different colors marked, at most.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This is a very nice auxiliary feature for doctors when planning radiation therapy.
    In order to keep the normal organ tissue away from radiation, having each organ
    clearly marked after segmentation saves time and effort.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Moreover, the platform can also mark each vertebrae individually, which greatly
    improves surgical accuracy when treating conditions like spinal cancer.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    and integrated them into the platform.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For brain MRI images, this platform can automatically delineate tumors, significantly
    reducing the likelihood of detecting false positives.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    while the dashed line represents manual delineation by a doctor. The difference
    between the two is very subtle, making subsequent verification quite convenient.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The level of convenience it offers is roughly akin to the difference between
    "writing homework" and "grading homework."
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: With the AI's automatic delineation, even patients without any medical background
    can clearly see the location, size, and number of tumors in their brain in 3D
    images, which is quite intuitive.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Furthermore, by comparing the MRI results after each radiation therapy session,
    patients can also see where tumors have been eliminated or reduced in number.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    with both parties having an equal understanding of the medical condition.

    improvement. Coolwulf is continuously updating it, adding new functionalities
    almost every few days.

    Similar levels are found in third-world countries like Myanmar, Iraq, South Africa,

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Features like organ segmentation in NeuralRad, while perhaps not necessary for
    most experienced radiation therapists in our country, are incredibly useful in
    countries where the level of medical expertise is lacking. Such a feature can
    save nearly a day's time in just a few minutes for many doctors in these regions.

    machines) and CT scanners simultaneously due to insufficient power supply.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    in these countries do not have hardware with sufficient computing power, nor do
    they have the funds to purchase AI service software. There's also a lack of understanding
    about AI technology, and even the performance of computers used by doctors can't
    be guaranteed."
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    and difficulties in accessing medical care to also benefit from technological
    conveniences, coolwulf decided to make the NeuralRad platform, like his previous
    projects, completely free.

    demands, and the cost of such equipment is beyond what many countries can afford.
  prefs: []
