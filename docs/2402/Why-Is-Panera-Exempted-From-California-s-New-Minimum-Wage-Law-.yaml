    per hour on April 1, one major chain will be exempted from the mandate—and it
    just so happens to have a connection to a longtime friend and donor to Gov. Gavin
    Newsom.

    minimum wage law that exempts "chains that bake bread and sell it as a standalone
    item," *Bloomberg *[reports](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-02-28/panera-bread-exempt-from-california-s-minimum-wage-increase-for-fast-food-worker),

    Group, a conglomerate that [operates more than 2,300 restaurants](https://www.qsrmagazine.com/reports/inside-making-greg-flynns-franchising-empire/)
    nationally and is the second-largest Panera franchisee in the world, according
    to the [company's website](https://flynn.com/panera/). Flynn and Newsom go way
    back: *Bloomberg *[reports](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-02-28/panera-bread-exempt-from-california-s-minimum-wage-increase-for-fast-food-worker)
    that the two attended the same high school at the same time—Flynn was student
    body president during Newsom's freshman year—and the restaurateur has donated
    to Newsom's gubernatorial campaigns and bragged to colleagues about his close
    relationship with the governor.

    Newsom said it was "part of the sausage making" of the legislative process. "We
    went back and forth, and it was part of the negotiation," he added.

    suggests it was something Newsom sought in those negotiations: The bakery carve-out
    "was adopted as a means of winning the governor''s support for the legislation,
    said a person with knowledge of the discussions. The rationale was the governor''s
    longstanding relationship with a Panera franchisee, the person said."'

    an environment where other fast-food restaurants competing with Panera for labor
    are required to pay $20 per hour, Panera will likely have to offer comparable
    wages in order to attract and retain workers. (One might also wonder if McDonald's
    and Burger King will suddenly [get into the bakery business](https://twitter.com/scottlincicome/status/1762877729479839900).)

    able to get a special exemption written into law. And, indeed, it's hard to blame
    Flynn for looking out for what's in his businesses' best interest here—he'd [previously
    warned state lawmakers](https://capitolweekly.net/franchises-are-key-to-a-healthy-california-workforce/)
    that passing the FAST Act would "effectively kill the franchise business model
    in the state" and put 728,000 jobs at risk.

    regulate other aspects of the economy) creates the conditions for exactly this
    sort of thing to happen. It could be that a wealthy special interest used his
    connections to the governor to secure special treatment, or that a governor tried
    to help out his friend. Either way, it couldn't have happened without the government
    injecting itself into the relationship between workers and employers.

    for officials to [reward their friends and punish their enemies](https://reason.com/2024/02/26/not-all-policy-is-industrial-policy/).
    That's not fair, nor should it be desirable. Panera—or any business—shouldn't
    survive or fail in California because of its connections in the halls of power.
