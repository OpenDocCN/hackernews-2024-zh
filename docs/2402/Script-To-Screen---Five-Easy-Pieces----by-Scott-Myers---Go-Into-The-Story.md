# Script To Screen: “Five Easy Pieces”

来自*Five Easy Pieces*的著名“拿掉鸡肉”的场景（剧本由卡罗尔·伊斯特曼编写，故事由卡罗尔·伊斯特曼和鲍勃·拉夫尔森共同创作）。

Setup: Bobby（杰克·尼科尔森饰演）和一些旅行伴侣想在一家餐馆点餐…… 他清楚自己想要什么。

```
 **INT. ROADSIDE CAFE - DAY** 		All four are seated at a booth. The women have
		given their orders and a WAITRESS stands above
		Bobby, waiting for his:
 **BOBBY** 				(looking at his menu)
			I'll have an omelette, no potatoes.
			Give me tomatoes instead, and wheat
			toast instead of rolls.
		The waitress indicates something on the menu with
		the butt of her pencil.
 **WAITRESS** 			No substitutions.
 **BOBBY** 			What does that mean? You don't have
			any tomatoes?
 **WAITRESS** 				(annoyed)
			No. We have tomatoes.
 **BOBBY** 			But I can't have any. Is that what
			you mean?
 **WAITRESS** 			Only what's on the menu...
				(again, indicating  with
				her pencil)
			A Number Two: Plain omelette. It
			comes with cottage fries and rolls.
 **BOBBY** 			I know what it comes with, but
			that's not what I want.
 **WAITRESS** 			I'll come back when you've made up
			your mind...
		She starts to move away and Bobby detains her.
 **BOBBY** 			Wait, I've made up my mind. I want
			a plain omelette, forget the
			tomatoes, don't put potatoes on the
			plate, and give me a side of wheat
			toast and a cup of coffee.
 **WAITRESS** 			I'm sorry, we don't have side
			orders of toast. I can give you an
			English muffin or a coffee roll.
 **BOBBY** 			What do you mean, you don't have
			side orders of toast? You make
			sandwiches, don't you?
 **WAITRESS** 			Would you like to talk to the
			manager?
 **PALM** 			Hey, mack!
 **BOBBY** 				(to Palm)
			Shut up.
				(to the waitress)
			You have bread, don't you, and a
			toaster of some kind?
 **WAITRESS** 			I don't make the rules.
 **BOBBY** 			Okay, I'll make it as easy for you
			as I can. Give me an omelette,
			plain, and a chicken salad sandwich
			on wheat toast -- no butter, no
			mayonnaise, no lettuce -- and a cup
			of coffee.
		She begins writing down his order, repeating it
		sarcastically:
 **WAITRESS** 			One Number Two, and a chicken sal
			san -- hold the butter, the mayo,
			the lettuce -- and a cup of
			coffee... Anything else?
 **BOBBY** 			Now all you have to do is hold the
			chicken, bring me the toast, charge
			me for the sandwich, and you
			haven't broken any rules.
 **WAITRESS** 				(challenging him)
			You want me to hold the chicken.
 **BOBBY** 			Yeah. I want you to hold it between
			your knees.
		The other three laugh, and the waitress points to a
		"Right to Refuse" sign above the counter.
 **WAITRESS** 			You see that sign, sir?!
		Bobby glances over at it, then back to her.
 **WAITRESS (CONT'D)** 			You'll all have to leave, I'm not
			taking any more of your smartness
			and your sarcasm!
		He smiles politely at her, then:
 **BOBBY** 			You see this sign?
		He reaches his arm out and "clears" the table for
		her.
```

电影中的这一场景如下：

尼科尔森几乎完全按照剧本中的描述表演，你可以感受到紧张气氛在逐渐升高。这里有一些关于这场戏的背景信息，来自尼科尔森和导演鲍勃·拉夫尔森。事实证明，尼科尔森在现实生活中确实搅乱了一桌饮料。这让我毫不意外！
