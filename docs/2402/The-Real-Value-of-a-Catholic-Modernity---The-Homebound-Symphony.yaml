    with several responses](https://www.google.com/books/edition/A_Catholic_Modernity/EEXoIaw6A0cC?hl=en&gbpv=1&printsec=frontcover)
    – called “A Catholic Modernity?” But do you know what the truly essential value
    of a Catholic modernity is? It was a Catholic modernity that defeated Dracula.

    memorable. Most readers will readily recall Dracula shrinking back from a crucifix
    thrust in his face; many will also remember the consecrated Hosts with which Dr.
    van Helsing “sanitises” the big boxes filled with Transylvanian earth in which
    Dracula plans to hide himself; or the moment when, in the Transylvanian wilderness
    near the Count’s castle, he crumples more Hosts into powder that he uses to form
    a protective circle around Mina Harker.

    London is the largest city in the world and offers an endless supply of victims:
    victims he can kill and victims he can make into an army of the Undead. But this
    man of the early modern era can only enter London by obeying the procedures of
    modernity, which is to say, by acquiring a modern *identity*. As James Scott has
    taught us – and this is a theme I pursue in [an essay nominally about Agatha Christie’s
    Miss Marple](https://www.thenewatlantis.com/publications/miss-marple-and-the-problem-of-modern-identity)
    – the modern state makes people *legible*. And it is because Dracula becomes legible
    that he is thwarted, discovered, and killed.'

- en: Because Dracula cannot move freely in the daytime, he must have a place of refuge
    and safety while the sun shines. So he needs both the aforementioned boxes – temporary
    coffins – and homes (“mansions”) or warehouses in which to keep them. To buy these
    things he needs money, which he has plenty of; but he also needs to follow the
    administrative procedures of the modern capitalist state. He can’t ship anything
    without giving a name and an address, and – more important to the story – without
    employing people, from real estate agents to plain old carters, who *keep records*.
    Our heroes’ long pursuit of Dracula is largely a matter of tracing the written
    records of everything Dracula does in England. Note also that the enemies of Dracula
    coordinate their plan of action with reference to the sequence of events that
    they have recorded using typewriters and phonographs. (*Dracula* is the first
    novel featuring voice memos.)

    office to destroy the handwritten journals and letters that document his evil
    deeds. But what he doesn’t know is that Mina Harker has made typewritten copies
    of it all. Dracula is like the Bishop of London in the sixteenth century who bought
    and burned copies of Tyndale’s New Testament, not realizing that Tyndale could
    use the proceeds to make more copies.

    are greatly aided by Mina’s knowledge of when the trains run — and by telegraphs
    they receive from London. Railway timetables, telegraphs, phonographs, typewriters,
    invoices, bills of lading, double-entry bookkeeping: these are the instruments
    by which Dracula’s pursuers draw their net around him. (And money – let’s not
    forget money. As Mina Harker writes in her journal, “Oh, it did me good to see
    the way that these brave men worked. How can women help loving men when they are
    so earnest, and so true, and so brave! And, too, it made me think of the wonderful
    power of money!”)'

    ability to summon and direct brute creatures – cannot match the powers of his
    Enemy. And that Enemy is not Dr. Van Helsing or Jonathan Harker or any of the
    other people who chase him, but rather technocratic modernity itself — supplemented
    and strengthened by the spiritual technologies of the Church, that is, material
    objects sanctified for holy purposes.
