    French philosopher Gilles Deleuze once called ‚Äú[the](https://masoncurrey.substack.com/p/deleuze-and-guattari-in-flux)
    *[flux](https://masoncurrey.substack.com/p/deleuze-and-guattari-in-flux)*.‚Äù He
    was describing what happened when he and the psychoanalyst F√©lix Guattari tried
    writing together‚Äîit was, he said, ‚Äúlike two streams coming together to make a
    third stream, which I suppose was us.‚Äù

    I proposed a method for‚Äîperhaps‚Äîcreating ‚Äúthe flux‚Äù in an individual practice.
    For *this* issue‚Äîwell, up until the end of last week I didn‚Äôt know what I was
    going to write about; I figured I‚Äôd move onto a new topic. But then an old friend
    emailed me out of the blue, and in our email exchange he mentioned *Deadwood*
    creator David Milch‚Äôs writing process, which involves him lying on the floor in
    a roomful of people and dictating to a typist.

    of *NYPD Blue*, the show that Milch worked on for seven seasons before that‚Äîbut
    who could resist this image of the writer on the floor, dictating to a roomful
    of people? So I did some digging around, and wouldn‚Äôt you know it: Milch‚Äôs process
    actually feels like yet another expression of this idea of ‚Äúthe flux.‚Äù'

- en: 'Here‚Äôs how it worked on *NYPD Blue* and, later, *Deadwood*: Milch would lie
    on the floor in the middle of a room in the show‚Äôs writing trailer, with other
    writers and producers sitting in chairs around him. In front of Milch would be
    a computer monitor displaying the script in progress. On the other side of the
    monitor, a typist sat at a desk (with his or her own monitor), typing the script
    as Milch dictated it. These writing sessions thus came to resemble a kind of s√©ance,
    with Milch summoning the voices of the characters, inventing their lines on the
    spot‚Äîand reciting variations of these lines over and over (and over and over)
    until he arrived at the exact right piece of dialogue.'

    video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHLtOKlHBFI) about the show. ‚ÄúIt was a
    two-and-a-third-page scene. He spent *five hours* rewriting that scene. I swear,
    he would change a sentence twenty or thirty times.‚Äù

    born of necessity. He suffers from obsessive-compulsive disorder, and being alone
    in a room‚Äîand especially operating a computer by himself‚Äîsimply offers too many
    opportunities for getting derailed by repetitive behaviors. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve come to recognize
    that the more isolated I am, the more disposed I am to obsessive processes,‚Äù Milch
    has said. ‚ÄúI find that by writing out in the open, I am less likely to, for example,
    begin to write the same sentence a thousand times, or hang upside-down like a
    bat in the corner of the room, you know, or smoke crack.‚Äù

    got involved in television, Milch had a book deal that he finally had to let lapse

    the same twelve pages almost word for word.‚Äù'

    against his worst impulses. But also‚Äîwatching clips of Milch at work, it‚Äôs clear
    that this is *fun* for him. He enjoys having an audience, and he enjoys the high-wire
    act of it. (‚ÄúIt was an audience, but it was also a fellowship of the spirit,‚Äù
    Milch writes in his memoir.) In that behind-the-scenes video I mentioned, a writer-producer

- en: I think he‚Äôs a genius because he‚Äôs solved a huge problem, which is that writing
    is really lonely. And it‚Äôs brutal to sit down and be by yourself and write. He
    eliminated it, first, by the dictation, by having the typist. And now he‚Äôs totally
    eliminated it by having a roomful of people. It‚Äôs a hell of a lot more fun than
    sitting alone in a room and feeling depressed.

    doing his dictation, he doesn‚Äôt think about the writing. He believes you should
    only write when you‚Äôre writing; otherwise you should put it out of your head entirely.
    ‚ÄúI try to consciously frustrate the impulse to think about a scene before I sit
    down to it,‚Äù Milch said in [a 2005](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2005/02/14/the-misfit-2)

    maybe fifteen years ago, it kind of blew my mind. I am continually trying to think
    my way to right action‚Äîtrying to cajole or bully or pep-talk myself into accomplishing
    the tasks that I‚Äôve set for myself. And it doesn‚Äôt work! Or it does work, but
    it requires an expenditure of willpower that is unreasonable and maybe impossible
    to sustain over the long haul. But *acting your way to right thinking*‚Äîhow do
    you actually do that? I guess I‚Äôm interested in Milch, and [Deleuze and Guattari](https://masoncurrey.substack.com/p/deleuze-and-guattari-in-flux),
    and [C√©line Sciamma](https://masoncurrey.substack.com/p/celine-sciamma-screenwriting-process),
    because they seem to offer examples of how to do it‚Äîhow to act your way into,
    if not *right* thinking, then *interesting* thinking, unexpected connections,
    and the kind of solutions that you can‚Äôt come up with by sheer willpower, sitting
    alone in a room with just your own thoughts.
