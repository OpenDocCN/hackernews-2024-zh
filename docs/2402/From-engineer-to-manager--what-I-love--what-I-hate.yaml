    engineering management position after the expansion of our team. I've been a front-end
    developer for 7 years before that, and initially I took the "advanced individual
    contributor" career track before doing the management turnaround. How's it been?
    Bumpy, but fun. In this article, I'll share the things I love and hate about my
    current job.

    you get both the formal and informal authority to change things for the better,
    and to make yourself and your team happier.'

    everybody goes "oh, crazy old Vladimir, all grumpy again, haha, where do you see
    tests fit here?". If you, an EM, casually say "guys, we really should write tests",
    you might be surprised to find the tests unexpectedly growing in different places.
    Pleasant.

    front-end engineer with React experience won't have trouble moving to another
    front-end framework, and can probably transition to a back-end / mobile engineering
    role with -1 grade (a year handicap or so). That's not bad.

    First, you can easily take on a team with a wildly different focus — mobile developers,
    infrastructure, ML engineers. You'd need some time to get up to speed on the big-picture
    technical struggles of your new team, but most companies would take this shot.
    If you don't want to be an EM any more, you're well-positioned to move to a project
    or product management role.

    work for other industries. While I don't see a big flow of tech managers moving
    into construction business (tech *does* pay well), there's one alternate path
    to consider — entrepreneurship. Involvement with people and business decisions
    makes for great training before starting your own business.

    involved to see how they feel about such a change, arrange new regular meetings,
    set up processes and communications, do some jira magic, maybe isolate the codebases
    of sub-products. If you think it can be done in a week, well, you're wrong.
