    exploited the staggered implementation of the G8 school reform across time and
    states to provide difference-in-difference estimates of the effect of the reform
    on student PISA scores. That’s a simple and plausibly causal design! They used
    all the standard controls—sex, age, parental education, only child status, immigrant
    status, foreign language status, etc.—and also had school-level controls—enrollment,
    female percentages, urbanicity, private school status, student-teacher ratios,
    teacher and resource shortages, etc. I extended this analysis by using *g* factor
    scores from a higher-order model of the PISA battery, consistent with the interpretation
    of PISA scores as reflections of *g* made by [Pokropek et al.](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2021-90838-001)  [on

    second is that it speaks to how, even if the G8 reform worsens inequality in student
    learning, that’s OK! On average, the reform was still beneficial, but *if* some
    people fall behind as a result, they’ll still have that extra year to repeat a

    students would have been anyway in terms of age progression.

    for. With the SOEP and PISA results, we see that when it comes to measured achievement,
    the reform is probably slightly beneficial. The NEPS result suggests that, if
    there’s a duration effect, it’s at least balanced by the intensity effect, resulting
    in no net effect on student learning, much less intelligence. The well-controlled

    the Ontario reform simply reduced the length of school and cut back on the curriculum
    to make room. As a result, they failed to raise the intensity of education to
    compensate for reduced time in it. The seemingly balanced impact in Germany might
    be ascribed to the necessarily increased intensity of education of their reform,
    and Ontario could take notice of that critical distinction.

    But, if we must have a certain quantity of school as a matter of human capital
    development, there are other options than holding people back from starting their
    adult lives. As the German experience shows us, increasing intensity seems capable
    of balancing the effect of time in education, so why not simply extend school
    days? In the process, we’d be able to incapacitate youths for longer—combatting
    the sharp ascent of the age-crime curve—and to fit in more schooling in fewer
    years, if we really wanted that.
