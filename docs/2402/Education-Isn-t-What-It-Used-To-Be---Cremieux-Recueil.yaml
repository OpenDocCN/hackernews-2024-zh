    For background, the German secondary education system is tracked. At the lowest
    level you have the *Hauptschulen*, schools for general learning which can be attended
    by anyone who attended a German elementary school. A level up from that are the
    *Realschulen*, which are generally gated by a test. Beyond the *Realschule* is
    the *Gymnasium*, the academically focused university preparatory schools. There
    are differences by Länder and some distinguish between the *Hauptschule* and the
    *Gesamtschule* (generally nonselective comprehensive schools), but that’s beyond
    the scope of this discussion. Using pre-reform PISA data from 2003, we can see
    how these schools are intellectually stratified:'

  zh: Bergold等人关注的改革非常有趣。背景是，德国的中等教育系统是分级的。最低级别是“Hauptschulen”，为一般学习提供学校，任何曾在德国小学就读的人都可以入学。比“Hauptschulen”高一级的是“Realschulen”，通常需要通过考试。超过“Realschule”的是“Gymnasium”，专注于学术的大学预备学校。各州之间存在差异，有些州区分“Hauptschule”和“Gesamtschule”（通常是综合性非选择性学校），但这超出了本讨论的范围。利用2003年前改革的PISA数据，我们可以看到这些学校在智力上的分层情况。
- en: The length of time students spend in secondary school differs by the type of
    school. The G8 reform reduced the length of time people spend in *Gymnasium* from
    nine to eight years. Students were expected to complete the exact same curriculum,
    but they were simply told to do so in a shorter amount of time with how that’s
    managed varying by state. In Berlin, Brandenburg, and Mecklenburg-Vorpommern,
    the reform reduced school lengths from seven to six years, and in Saxony and Thuringia,
    the reform did nothing since they already had shorter school lengths since 1949.

    Rhineland-Palatinate, only some schools were ever transitioned to G8, and they

- en: 'With each of these results—from the SOEP, NEPS, and PISA—in hand, I believe
    we can confidently reject the results of Bergold et al.’s analysis and suggest
    quite confidently that they were driven by selection that they didn’t account
    for. With the SOEP and PISA results, we see that when it comes to measured achievement,
    the reform is probably slightly beneficial. The NEPS result suggests that, if
    there’s a duration effect, it’s at least balanced by the intensity effect, resulting
    in no net effect on student learning, much less intelligence. The well-controlled
    evidence all seems to agree: shortening school lengths in Germany was not harmful.
    We shouldn’t fear it, nor should we believe poorly controlled results showing
    *massive* declines in actual student intelligence in the first place.'

    twelve month reduction, due in part to grade repetition rates increasing by 3.08%,
    or about a fifth in relative terms. Consistent with girls being the more studious
    sex, boys experienced an increase of 3.78% versus 2.40% for girls. This finding,

    was largest in the final, *Oberstufe*, year that students might wish to voluntarily
    retake to “change their specialist subject choices or to improve their grade point
    average, for example.” The rates of graduating with an Abitur were also not found
