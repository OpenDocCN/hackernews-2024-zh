- en: Mozilla Corp., which manages the open-source Firefox browser, announced today
    that Mitchell Baker is stepping down as CEO to focus on AI and internet safety
    as chair of the nonprofit foundation. Laura Chambers, a Mozilla board member and
    entrepreneur with experience at [Airbnb](https://fortune.com/company/airbnb/),
    [PayPal](https://fortune.com/company/paypal-holdings/), and [eBay](https://fortune.com/company/ebay/),
    will step in as interim CEO to run operations until a permanent replacement is
    found.

- en: Baker, a Silicon Valley pioneer who cofounded the Mozilla Project, says it was
    her decision to step down as CEO, adding that the move is motivated by a sense
    of urgency over the current state of the internet and public trust. “We want to
    offer an alternative for people to have better products,” says Baker, who wants
    to draw more attention to policies, products, and processes to challenge business
    models built on fueling outrage. “What are the connections between this global
    malaise and how humans are engaging with each other and technology?”

- en: Chambers says she plans to focus on building out new products that address growing
    privacy concerns while actively looking for a full-time CEO. Prior to being recruited
    to the Mozilla board three years ago, Chambers says she was feeling “pretty disillusioned”
    about society because of the influence of money in politics and the growing power
    of the tech giants. “I was confused about what to do, and this felt like a genuine
    way to make an impact.”

    move back to Australia later this year for family reasons. “I think this is an
    example of Mozilla doing the right role-modeling in how to manage a succession,”
    says Chambers.

- en: The move comes at a time when Mozilla has no choice but to reimagine its role
    in a world dominated by Big Tech and AI. Firefox, which launched 20 years ago
    to challenge the dominance of Internet Explorer and once accounted for more than
    30% of the global browser market, has shrunk to low single digits in a world dominated
    by [Google](https://fortune.com/company/alphabet/) Chrome. Mozilla generates revenue
    through search partnerships, a majority of which come from Google.

    of mission in creating alternatives to tackle deepfakes, data privacy issues,
    and the power of Big Tech. It launched [a Mozilla.ai startup](https://blog.mozilla.org/en/mozilla/introducing-mozilla-ai-investing-in-trustworthy-ai/) last
    year and Mozilla Corp. is focused on product extensions like Mozilla Monitor that
    wipe subscribers’ data off the web.

  zh: 但是，AI 给这个非营利基金会及其联合创始人贝克尔带来了新的使命感，即创建替代方案来解决深度伪造、数据隐私问题和大科技公司的权力。去年，它推出了一个名为
    [Mozilla.ai 创业公司](https://blog.mozilla.org/en/mozilla/introducing-mozilla-ai-investing-in-trustworthy-ai/)
    的项目，Mozilla 公司专注于产品扩展，如 Mozilla Monitor，可清除订阅者在网络上的数据。
- en: For Baker, success is about influencing the conversation and giving consumers,
    as well as developers, a meaningful choice in how they operate online. “Our goal
    is to build something different,” she says, “business models with some societal
    purpose and public benefit” that give users meaningful control over their data.
    “The qualities of online life can be improved.”
