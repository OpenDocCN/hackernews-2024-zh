- en: I am an engineer by training with the questionable instinct to run towards problems,
    especially problems that should not be problems. When I heard that the United
    States could not produce sufficient 155 mm artillery shells to supply Ukraine,
    I thought it sounded odd. I knew essentially nothing about artillery save I would
    want to be on the other end of one. I was generally aware [the industrial base
    for the defense industry had either atrophied or specialized or both](https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R47751),
    depending on your perspective. Maybe this was just over-specialization? A dependency
    on a single part? Maybe it is a reliance on something exotic? Surely, there must
    be an explanation, something that would help me understand why we are so ill-prepared.
    Maybe there is some new technology that could be applied? This is a record of
    what I learned for the benefit of a more-educated citizenry and to save time for
    anyone else investigating the issue.

    that require building things is to avoid it at all costs. Congress is loathe to
    fund munition supplies that are never used, and defense contractors are loathe
    to build factories that sit idle (and despite what Hollywood may portray, everyone
    wants deterrence, not actual conflict). Though Congress and DOD are funding a
    new facility, 3-4 years will have passed before it produces a shell, which is
    entirely unhelpful in a present conflict. Instead, the DOD is attempting to plug
    the Ukraine-sized hole with shells from allied nations including Canada, South
    Korea, Finland, and Germany—places where it’s still possible to build new things.

- en: I believe in alliances, especially when it is the free people of the world standing
    against aggression from authoritarians. What troubles me here, though, is that
    the US is pursuing that option because the domestic defense industrial base, inclusive
    of DOD and its contractors, is sclerotic. It treats time like it’s free. It does
    not respond quickly. It does not build or innovate around current problems, because
    of a combination of disincentives from DOD’s own structure and the pervasive challenges
    of trying to run a manufacturing business in the US. These are largely own goals.
    If the DOD would write longer term contracts. If we did not declare essential
    production facilities to be historic landmarks, strangling expansion. I did not
    even want to get into why GOCOs exist or the labyrinth of DOD procurement, but
    it is sufficient to say they both pose challenges to doing anything new or different.
    My solace is that in a real conflict, all of that red tape would be put to the
    side and people can get about building things. There will be a multi-year lag
    between when that crisis happens and how fast the factories can return, and I
    hope we can weather that storm.

    that with the right application of influence and creativity, new companies can
    compete effectively against the prime contractors. I am less certain that is a
    possibility here for a few reasons. The primary concern is getting an ROI in 3-4
    years on the capital required to build such a facility. You either need a technological
    edge that dramatically reduces the capital expense, or you need to be able to
    blend production with other commercial goods (i.e. dual use). For the former,
    I do not see a dramatically cheaper option unless there is some arbitrage on cheaper
    electric arc furnaces and presses. For the latter, 3D printing could be an answer,
    if the material properties existed. However, metal 3D printing companies are struggling
    with sales as-is, reflecting a lack of commercial demand for commercial 3D printed
    metal parts. Therefore, even with the steel needed, I am confident it would be
    a battle to keep them full the rest of the time. This only gets harder without
    a technological edge like 3D printing, as it would be a sub-scale, commodity steel
    mill likely optimized for an application with only one real customer.

    requirements of an artillery shell are that it must withstand great force to be
    launched, before another explosion breaks the shell into fragments. The first
    force—launch—requires a high yield strength, such that the metal won’t deform
    (yield) under that pressure. In the vernacular, yield strength = yeet distance,
    while the fragmentation characteristics of the metal relate to the lethality.
    HF-1 was selected because of how predictable it shatters while maintaining a high
    yield strength. Everything you could ever want to know about this steel and its
    competitors is available in a report that Bethlehem Steel put together in 1973:

    A core problem for DOD and the defense contractors is that they have to build
    custom production lines to surge demand. But if there’s no conflict in Europe,
    these machines are mostly idle. 3D printing is essentially a line designed to
    be changed much faster, as you can make many different shapes. In theory, with
    a fleet of metal printers, you could be making war components when necessary and
    making commercial parts in peacetime. They would almost certainly be more expensive
    than a dedicated production line, but if the US doesn’t want to pay the capital
    for it, at least this would be an option. Unfortunately, the short answer is no,
    3D printing can’t help here, at least not with today’s technology.

    high-silicon, high-carbon steel. Metal 3D printing is still pretty limited with
    some vendors offering questionable material properties that are not attempting
    to touch high-performance steels. It makes sense the machine vendors wouldn’t
    prioritize a metal without much commercial appeal.

- en: The other operative question is if a shell casing would fit in the build volume
    of a current 3D printer. Given the shells are 858 mm in length and 155 mm in diameter,
    they fit in the build chamber of Velo3D’s 1MZ printers (315x1000 mm and 600x1000
    mm), though it looks like they exceed the existing build plate options. In that
    orientation, they would also have an extremely long print time.

    Allegedly, the site’s structure as a GOCO disincentivizes optimizing yield. The
    contractor gets paid the same for operating it as-is, and if the government wants
    to fix it up, they would have to put in the time and energy.

    Scranton AAP started life in 1908 as a steam locomotive erecting and repair facility.
    With trains on the decline, it was established as an army ammunition plant in
    1953 but sits in a larger national historic district and is listed on the National
    Registry of Historical Places. I imagine it is a spectacular testament to when
    we used to build stuff.

    out in Ukraine. It is now February 2024, and the DOD is saying we’ll be at 100ku
    by early 2025 with little other information about the ramp up.

    capacity at 28ku, the new facilities would add 72ku total. Assuming an even split,
    each would be producing 36ku or 130% the capacity of SCAAP each by early 2025,
    **more than 2 years after the contract was awarded and 3 years after hostilities
    began**.

    Additionally, permitting is difficult, construction labor is tight at the moment,
    and there is no incentive to go faster, especially if US political will is waning
    in the face of Republicans viewing Ukraine’s independence as a gift to their rival
    Democrats.

    supply chains allow. For our own production capabilities, I imagine something
    that looked more like Operation Warp Speed to develop the COVID vaccine, where
    the government no longer treats time as free. We have many of the machines required
    in the US; these would need to be co-located to be dedicated to a war effort.
    The permitting issues would evaporate, and the DOD would award contracts of whatever
    length to justify the facilities. With the tools and raw materials, the next question
    is having the right mix of people and automation to operate the tools. In a crunch
    like this, you would likely have more people initially while you quickly automated
    what you could. Training those workers would be key.
