- en: Nimbus is an intelligent control plane for modern observability. Our mission
    is to enable FAANG-like observability for every organization in the world. We're
    starting with an optimization engine to reduce datadog costs by an order of magnitude
    without manual effort from developers.

- en: 'How it works: Update three lines in your datadog agent configuration to send
    data to Nimbus. Nimbus analyzes all incoming logs for common patterns while proxying
    data upstream. Based on the analysis, Nimbus comes up with optimizations that
    can be reviewed and deployed by a human in one click. We employ novel compression
    techniques to reduce billable volume by an order of magnitude without dropping
    data. You can watch a demo of this at [nimbus.dev](https://nimbus.dev/?utm_source=hm)'

- en: We're looking to hire our first founding engineer to help us expand beyond logging.
    Nimbus today can reduce log volume by over 90% without losing signal - our immediate
    priorities is to do the same for metrics and traces.
