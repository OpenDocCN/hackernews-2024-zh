    tree framing where the front door once stood. Its walls have been hollowed by
    decades of typhoons, monsoons and summer humidity, now little more than loose,
    moss-covered stones and mortar dust. Vines tease through cracks in the foundations
    and fallen leaves litter the rotten floorboards.

    since 2002, first stumbled across the city’s abandoned villages in 2012 while
    visiting a friend in the New Territories, a vast area to the city’s north. Accounting
    for over 85% of Hong Kong’s territory, the district is characterized by steep
    mountains, long stretches of rugged coastline and tree-covered country parks.

  zh: 爱尔文自2002年以来一直居住在[香港](https://www.cnn.com/world/asia/hong-kong)，2012年首次发现了这些城市中的废弃村庄，当时他在新界访问朋友，新界是这座城市北部的广阔地区，占据了香港85%以上的领土。该区以陡峭的山脉、崎岖的海岸线和覆盖着树木的乡村公园而闻名。
- en: “It made me question, ‘Why (were) so many of these places vacant in a place
    like Hong Kong, where the property prices are the highest in the world?’” Irvine
    recalled. Over the next 12 years, the London-born photographer explored more of
    these abandoned villages, documenting what would become the subject of his new
    book, “[Abandoned Villages of Hong Kong](https://www.stefanirvine.photo/book/abandoned-villages-of-hong-kong-stefan-irvine).”

  zh: “这让我产生了疑问，‘为什么在一个房地产价格全球最高的地方，这么多地方空置呢？’”爱尔文回忆道。在接下来的12年里，这位伦敦出生的摄影师探索了更多这样的废弃村庄，记录下了他新书的主题，“[香港废弃村庄](https://www.stefanirvine.photo/book/abandoned-villages-of-hong-kong-stefan-irvine)”。

    plants spilling out onto the road through a yellow door frame — in 2012, it wasn’t
    until 2019 that he began actively hunting down locations to photograph.

- en: “These villages have existed in Hong Kong for hundreds of years, way before
    the colonial period,” explained Irvine. In the 1950s and ‘60s, as Hong Kong grew
    as an industrial hub, many people migrated to the rapidly expanding urban centers
    for better working opportunities. “It’s hard farming and fishing out there in
    these remote areas, so a lot of people moved to the city to work in the factories,”
    he added.

  zh: “这些村庄在殖民时期之前已存在了数百年，”爱尔文解释道。在20世纪50年代和60年代，随着香港成为工业中心，许多人移居到迅速扩展的城市中寻求更好的工作机会。“在这些偏远地区耕种和捕鱼都很困难，所以很多人搬到城市去工厂工作，”他补充道。
- en: 'Through library research, the 48-year-old photographer found people who grew
    up in the villages or had relatives who lived there. In the book, he included
    essays from two women connected to the village: one whose father grew up in Wong
    Chuk Shan village, now completely overgrown, and another who spent several years
    of her childhood in Lai Chi Wo village, on the northeast coast of Hong Kong in
    the 1970s.'

  zh: 通过图书馆的研究，这位48岁的摄影师找到了在村庄长大或有亲戚居住的人。在书中，他包括了两位与村庄有关的女性的文章：一位的父亲在现在已完全丛林化的黄竹山村长大，另一位在20世纪70年代在香港东北海岸的荔枝窝村度过了几年童年时光。
- en: '“Now she lives in the UK with her own family, but she comes back to visit HK
    every few years, and still feels a deep sense of connection with Lai Chi Wo,”
    Irvine said of the latter woman, adding: “You can tell they feel an intense bond
    with their ancestors and with the village itself.”'

  zh: “现在她和自己的家庭住在英国，但她每隔几年就会回港，仍然对荔枝窝有着深厚的情感联系，”欧文谈到后者说：“你可以看得出她们与祖先和村庄本身有着深厚的情感纽带。”

    homes that appeared to have been “abandoned pretty rapidly,” with personal items
    and furniture left behind.

- en: “I think a lot of people left with the intention of coming back one day, or
    maybe retiring back in the village. But if you don’t maintain these properties,
    eventually they’ll succumb to nature. Termites will start to burrow their way
    into the wooden beams. If one of those collapses, then the seeds can fall in from
    trees and plants, and then they really take over.”

  zh: “我觉得很多人离开时都打算有一天回来，或者退休回到村庄。但如果你不去维护这些财产，最终它们会被大自然所征服。白蚁会开始在木梁上打洞。如果其中一根梁木坍塌了，那么树木和植物的种子就会落下来，然后它们真的会占领这些地方。”
- en: Rotting floorboards and unstable masonry made some of the building dangerous
    to explore. For Irvine, the biggest risk was posed by territorial village dogs
    that often became aggressive as he walked through remote areas. “I started the
    habit of carrying dog biscuits in my camera bag when I went out to these places,”
    he said.

  zh: 腐烂的地板和不稳定的砖石使得一些建筑物危险，无法探索。对欧文来说，最大的风险来自那些领地内的村庄狗，他经常在偏远地区行走时会变得攻击性。“我开始养成习惯，出门到这些地方时在相机包里带上狗饼干，”他说。
- en: The project took Irvine to the furthest reaches of the city, using minibuses
    and ferries to access isolated towns and islands. One adventure saw him embark
    on a six-hour round trip to Tung Ping Chau, a far-flung island closer to the Chinese
    mainland than to Hong Kong. Once a [thriving fishing and farming community](https://www.geopark.gov.hk/en/discover/attractions/tung-ping-chau),
    most residents left the island in the 1960s to make a living in the city. Irvine
    ended up using just one image from the trip in his book — but the trip was “totally
    worth it,” he said.

- en: “Lai Chi Wo is quite interesting because (Hong Kong’s) government has realized
    the heritage value in this village and they’ve invested a substantial amount of
    money to revitalize some of the old buildings,” said Irvine. “They want to encourage
    young people to go out there and stay overnight and to experience a different
