- en: Similarly, let's say I ask myself a question like, "on which platform do I get
    a higher rate of scams, spam, fraudulent content, etc., [smaller platform] or
    [larger platform]"? Generally the answer is [larger platform]. Of course, there
    are more total small platforms out there and they're higher variance, so I could
    deliberately use a smaller platform that's worse, but I'm choosing good options
    instead of bad options, in every size class, the smaller platform is generally
    better. For example, with Signal vs. WhatsApp, I've literally never received a
    spam Signal message, whereas I get spam WhatsApp messages somewhat regularly.
    Or if I compare places I might read tech content on, if I compare tiny forums
    no one's heard of to lobste.rs, lobste.rs has a very slightly higher rate (rate
    as in fraction of messages I see, not absolute message volume) of bad content
    because it's zero on the private forums and very low but non-zero on lobste.rs.
    And then if I compare lobste.rs to a somewhat larger platform, like Hacker News
    or mastodon.social, those have (again very slightly) higher rates of scam/spam/fraudulent
    content. And then if I compare that to mid-sized social media platforms, like
    reddit, reddit has a significantly higher and noticeable rate of bad content.
    And then if I can compare reddit to the huge platforms like YouTube, Facebook,
    [Google search results](/seo-spam/), these larger platforms have an even higher
    rate of scams/spam/fraudulent content. And, as with the SD card example, the odds
    of getting decent support go down as the platform size goes up as well. In the
    event of an incorrect suspension or ban from the platform, the odds of an account
    getting reinstated get worse as the platform gets larger.

  zh: 同样地，假设我问自己一个问题，像是，“在哪个平台上，我会遇到更多的诈骗、垃圾邮件、欺诈内容等，[较小平台]还是[较大平台]？” 通常答案是[较大平台]。当然，世上有更多的小平台，它们的差异性更高，所以我可以有意选择一个更糟糕的小平台，但我选择的是好的选择而不是坏的选择，在每个大小类别中，较小平台通常更好。例如，与
    Signal 对比 WhatsApp，我从未收到过垃圾 Signal 消息，而我经常收到垃圾 WhatsApp 消息。或者如果我比较一些可能阅读科技内容的地方，比如我比较没人听说过的小型论坛和
    lobste.rs，lobste.rs 的坏内容稍微高一些（比率指我看到的信息比例，而不是绝对信息量），因为私人论坛上是零，而在 lobste.rs 上是非零但很低。然后，如果我将
    lobste.rs 与稍大一些的平台如 Hacker News 或 mastodon.social 比较，这些平台（再次很轻微地）有更高的诈骗/垃圾邮件/欺诈内容比率。然后，如果我将其与中型社交媒体平台如
    reddit 比较，reddit 的坏内容率显著更高。然后，如果我将 reddit 与 YouTube、Facebook、[Google 搜索结果](/seo-spam/)
    这类巨大平台比较，这些大型平台的诈骗/垃圾邮件/欺诈内容率更高。并且，就像 SD 卡的例子一样，随着平台规模的增大，获得良好支持的可能性也会降低。在平台错误暂停或封禁的情况下，随着平台规模的增大，账户获得恢复的可能性也会变得更小。

    the result empirically. At least at [the level of resources that big companies

    enough resources to significantly reduce this problem, they have chosen not to

    profit before tax (through December 2023) was $47B. If Meta had a version of the
    internal vision statement of a power company a friend mine worked for ("Reliable
    energy, at low cost, for generations.") and operated like that power company did,
    trying to create a good experience for the user instead of maximizing profit plus
    creating the metaverse, they could've spent the $50B they spent on the metaverse
    on moderation platforms and technology and then spent $30k/yr (which would result
    in a very good income in most countries where moderators are hired today, allowing
    them to have their pick of who to hire) on 1.6 million additional full-time staffers
    for things like escalations and support, on the order of one additional moderator
    or support staffer per few thousand users (and of course diseconomies of scale
    apply to managing this many people). I'm not saying that Meta or Google should
    do this, just that whenever someone at big tech company says [something like](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38614042)
    "these systems have to be fully automated because no one could afford to operate
    manual systems at our scale", what's really being said is more along the lines
    of "we would not be able to generate as many billions a year in profit if we hired

    where economies of scale legitimately make the experience better for users. For
    example, when we looked at [why it's so hard to buy things that work well](/nothing-works/),
    we noted that Amazon's economies of scale have enabled them to build out their
    own package delivery service that is, while flawed, still more reliable than is
    otherwise available (and this has only improved since they added the ability for
    users to rate each delivery, which no other major package delivery service has).
    Similarly, Apple's scale and vertical integration has allowed them to [build one
    of the all-time great performance teams](https://mastodon.social/@danluu/111064942895424216)

    not only wiping the floor with the competition on benchmarks, but also providing

    latency](/input-lag/). For a more mundane example of economies of scale, crackers
    and other food that ships well are cheaper on Amazon than in my local grocery
    store. It's easy to name ways in which economies of scale benefit the user, but
    this doesn't mean that we should assume that economies of scale dominate diseconomies
    of scale in all areas. Although it's beyond the scope of this post, if we're going
    to talk about whether or not users are better off if companies are larger or smaller,
    we should look at what gets better when companies get bigger and what gets worse,
    not just assume that everything will get better just because some things get better

    sense to look at how much effort is being expended. Meta's involvement in Myanmar
    makes for a nice case study because Erin Kissane wrote up a fairly detailed [40,000
    word account of what happened](https://erinkissane.com/meta-in-myanmar-full-series).
    The entirety of what happened is a large and complicated issue ([see appendix
    for more discussion](#appendix-erin-kissane-on-meta-in-myanmar)) but, for the
    main topic of this post, the key components are that there was an issue that most
    people can generally agree should be among the highest priority moderation and
    support issues and that, despite repeated, extremely severe and urgent, warnings
    to Meta staff at various levels (engineers, directors, VPs, execs, etc.), almost
    no resources were dedicated to the issue while internal documents indicate that
    only a small fraction of agreed-upon bad content was caught by their systems (on
    the order of a few percent). I don't think this is unique to Meta and this matches
    my experience with other large tech companies, both as a user of their products
    and as an employee.

    Kissane写了一篇相当详细的[4万字账户发生的事情](https://erinkissane.com/meta-in-myanmar-full-series)。整个事件是一个庞大且复杂的问题（[请参见附录进行更多讨论](#appendix-erin-kissane-on-meta-in-myanmar)），但对于本文的主题来说，关键的组成部分是，有一个问题，大多数人普遍认为应该是最高优先级的审核和支持问题，尽管在各个层级的Meta员工（工程师、主管、副总裁、高管等）多次发出严重和紧急的警告，几乎没有资源专门用于此问题，而内部文件显示，仅有很小一部分约定的不良内容被他们的系统捕捉到（大约百分之几）。我认为这种情况并不局限于Meta，这与我作为其产品用户和员工的经验相符。

    users (at least 10% of people I know have lost an account due to incorrect bans
    and, if I search for a random person I don't know, there's a good chance I get
    multiple accounts for them, with some recent one that has a profile that reads
    "used to be @[some old account]", with no forward from the old account to the
    new one because they're now banned). When I ran into a senior engineer from the
    team that works on this stuff, I asked him why so many legitimate users get banned
    and he told me something like "that's not a problem, the real problem is that
    we don't ban enough accounts. Everyone who's banned deserves it, it's not worth
    listening to appeals or thinking about them". Of course it's true that [most content
    on every public platform is bad content, spam, etc.](https://twitter.com/danluu/status/964562384558927872),
    so if you have any sort of signal at all on whether or not something is bad content,
    when you look at it, it's likely to be bad content. But this doesn't mean the
    converse, that almost no users are banned incorrectly, is true. And if senior
    people on the team that classifies which content is bad have the attitude that
    we shouldn't worry about false positives because almost all flagged content is
    bad, we'll end up with a system that has a large number of false positives. I
    later asked around to see what had ever been done to reduce false positives in
    the fraud detection systems and found out that there was no systematic attempt
    at tracking false positives at all, no way to count cases where employees filed
    internal tickets to override bad bans, etc.; At the meta level, there was some
    mechanism to decrease the false negative rate (e.g., someone sees bad content
    that isn't being caught then adds something to catch more bad content) but, without
    any sort of tracking of false positives, there was effectively no mechanism to
    decrease the false positive rate. It's no surprise that this meta system resulted
    in over 10% of people I know getting incorrect suspensions or bans. And, as Patrick
    McKenzie says, the optimal rate of false positives isn't zero. But when you have
    engineers who have the attitude that they've done enough legwork that false positives
    are impossible, it's basically guaranteed that the false positive rate is higher
    than optimal. When you combine this with normal big company levels of support,
    it's a recipe for kafkaesque user experiences.

    the false positive banning I was concerned about could never happen. And then

    distorts what states do. One could easily write a highly analogous book, Seeing
    like a Tech Company about what's illegible to companies that scale up, at least
    as companies are run today. A simple example of this is that, in many video games,
    including ones made by game studios that are part of a $3T company, it's easy
    to get someone suspended or banned by having a bunch of people report the account
    for bad behavior. What's legible to the game company is the rate of reports and
    what's not legible is the player's actual behavior (it could be legible, but the
    company chooses not to have enough people or skilled enough people examine actual
    behavior); [and many people have reported similar bannings with social media companies](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31581510).

    (submissions) page while logged in, you'll see a steady stream of automatically
    killed stories from these hellbanned users. While there are quite a few of them,
    the percentage is generally well under half. When we looked at a "mid-sized" big
    tech company like Twitter circa 2017, based on the public numbers, if spam bots
    were hellbanned instead of removed, spam is so much more prevalent that all you'd
    see if you were able to see it. And, as big companies go, 2017-Twitter isn't that
    big. As we also noted, the former PM of FB ads targeting explained that numbers
    as low as 100M are in the "I can't count that low" range, too small to care about;

- en: The second area we looked at was support, which tends to get worse as companies
    get larger. At a high level, it's fair to say that companies don't care to provide
    decent support (with Amazon being somewhat of an exception here, especially with
    AWS, but even on the consumer side). Inside the system, there are individuals
    who care, but if you look at the fraction of resources expended on support vs.
    growth or even fun/prestige projects, support is an afterthought. Back when deepmind
    was training a StarCraft AI, it's plausible that Alphabet was spending more money
    playing Starcraft than on support agents (and, if not, just throw in one or two
    more big AI training projects and you'll be there, especially if you include the
    amortized cost of developing custom hardware, etc.).

    support and get connected to someone who's paid $1/hr to respond to you in a language
    they barely know, attempting to help solve a problem they don't understand by
    walking through some flowchart, or appeal an issue and get told "after careful
    review, we have determined that you have [done the opposite of what you actually
    did]". In some cases, you don't even need to get that far, like when [following
    Instagram's support instructions results in an infinite loop that takes you back

    ["click here if this wasn't you link returns a 404"](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34549132).
    I've run into an infinite loop like this once, with Verizon, and it persisted
    for at least six months. I didn't check after that, but I'd bet on it persisting
    for years. If you had an onboarding or sign-up page that had an issue like this,
    that would be considered a serious bug that people should prioritize because that
    impacts growth. But for something like account loss due to scammers taking over
    accounts, that might get fixed after months or years. Or maybe not.

- en: When you talk to people who work on support at companies that do actually care
    about this, it's apparent that it can be done much better. While I was writing
    this post, I actually did support at a company that does support decently well
    (for a tech company, adjusted for size, I'd say they're well above [99%-ile](/p95-skill/)),
    including going through the training and onboarding process for support folks.
    [Executing anything well at scale is non-trivial](/sounds-easy/), so I don't mean
    to downplay how good their support org is, but the most striking thing to me was
    how much of the effectiveness of the org naturally followed from caring about
    providing a good support experience for the user. A full discussion of what that
    means is too long to include here, so we'll look at this in more detail another
    time, but one example is that, when we look at how big company support responds,
    it's often designed to discourage the user from responding ("this review is final")
    or to justify, putatively to the user, that the company is doing an adequate job
    ("this was not a purely automated process and each appeal was reviewed by humans
    in a robust process that ... "). This company's training instructs you to do the
    opposite of the standard big company "please go away"-style and "we did a great
    job and have a robust process, therefore complaints are invalid"-style responses.
    For every anti-pattern you commonly see in support, the training tells you to
    do the opposite and discusses why the anti-pattern results in a bad user experience.
    Moreover, the culture has deeply absorbed these ideas (or rather, these ideas
    come out of the culture) and there are processes for ensuring that people really
    know what it means to provide good support and follow through on it, support folks
    have ways to directly talk to the developers who are implementing the product,
    etc.

    junior employees "big company HR isn't there to help you; their job is to protect

    to a bigger site, like lobste.rs, or even bigger like HN, that's too large for
    someone to read every message (well, this could be done for lobste.rs, but considering
    that it's a spare-time pursuit for the owner and the volume of messages, it's
    not reasonable to expect them to read every message in a short timeframe), but
    there's still a single person who provides the vision for what should happen,
    even if the sites are large enough that it's not reasonable to literally read
    every message. The "no vehicles in the park" problem doesn't apply here because
    a person decides what the policies should be. You might not like those policies,

    thought it was a proof were going off of signals like David's track record or
    the prestige of his institution. At the time, without having read the paper myself,
    I guessed (with low confidence) that the proof was incorrect based on the meta-heuristic
    that thoughts from people who read the paper were stronger evidence than things
    like prestige. Similarly, I would guess that Erin's summary is at least roughly
    accurate and that Erin's endorsement of the UN HRC fact-finding mission is correct,

- en: There is a form of the above objection that's technically correct — for an engineer
    at a big tech company, the term Head of Engineering will generally call to mind
    an executive who all engineers transitively report into (or, in cases where there
    are large pillars, perhaps one of a few such people). Someone who's fluent in
    internal tech company lingo would probably not use this phrasing, even when writing
    for lay people, but this isn't strong evidence of factual errors in the article

    and fake accounts (although those were also done), and included direct conversations

    while traveling because I only took my code generator and left my 2FA tokens at
    home; this was in the relatively early days of 2FA tokens and I added the tokens
    to reduce the odds that I would be locked out, because the documentation indicated
    that I would need any of my 2FA methods to be available to not get locked out;
    in fact, this is false, and Google will sometimes only let you authenticate with
    specific methods, so adding more methods actually increases the chances you'll
    get locked out if your concern is that you may lose a method and then lose access
    to your account

    fix it, but it might also just work to re-upload the video. Another time, Keeley
    got "hacked" and went to support. Support once again responded quickly, but all

    Keeley was hoping that support would fix the issue, but instead they appear to

    hand, it could also be an early engineering sample with all sorts of bugs or other
    issues; when I worked for a CPU company, we would buy Intel CPUs to test them
    and engineering samples would not only have a variety of bugs that only manifested
    in certain circumstances, they would sometimes have instructions that did completely
    different things that could be reasonable behavior, except that Intel had changed
    the specified behavior before release, so the CPU would just do the wrong thing,
    resulting in crashes on real software (this happened with the first CPU we were
    able to get that had the `MWAIT` instruction, an engineering sample that was apparently
    from before Intel had finalized the current behavior of `MWAIT`).

    of violence against Duterte critics. After years in politics, Harbath wasn’t naive

    platform had rewarded his combative and sometimes underhanded brand of politics.

    to thrive on Facebook—supporters of the “Leave” camp had obliterated “Remain”
    supporters on the platform. ... Harbath found all that to be gross, but there
    was no denying that Trump was successfully using Facebook and Twitter to short-circuit
    traditional campaign coverage, garnering attention in ways no campaign ever had.
    “I mean, he just has to go and do a short video on Facebook or Instagram and then
    the media covers it,” Harbath had marveled during a talk in Europe that spring.

    on the platform—but it certainly wasn’t the majority of content. Numerically,
    falsehoods accounted for just a fraction of all news viewed on Facebook, and news
    itself was just a fraction of the platform’s overall content. That such a fraction
    of a fraction could have thrown the election was downright illogical, Zuckerberg
    insisted.. ... But Zuckerberg was the boss. Ignoring Kornblut’s advice, he made
    his case the following day during a live interview at Techonomy, a conference
    held at the Ritz-Carlton in Half Moon Bay. Calling fake news a “very small” component
    of the platform, he declared the possibility that it had swung the election “a
    crazy idea.” ... A favorite saying at Facebook is that “Data Wins Arguments.”
    But when it came to Zuckerberg’s argument that fake news wasn’t a major problem
    on Facebook, the company didn’t have any data. As convinced as the CEO was that
    Facebook was blameless, he had no evidence of how “fake news” came to be, how
    it spread across the platform, and whether the Trump campaign had made use of
    it in their Facebook ad campaigns. ... One week after the election, BuzzFeed News
    reporter Craig Silverman published an analysis showing that, in the final months
    of the election, fake news had been the most viral election-related content on
    Facebook. A story falsely claiming that the pope had endorsed Trump had gotten
    more than 900,000 likes, reshares, and comments—more engagement than even the
    most widely shared stories from CNN, the New York Times, or the Washington Post.
    The most popular falsehoods, the story showed, had been in support of Trump.

    an outgrowth of the fake news publishers that Facebook had battled in the wake
    of the 2016 election. While fact-checks and other crackdown efforts had made it
    far harder for outright hoaxes to go viral, the publishers had regrouped. Some
    of the same entities that BuzzFeed had written about in 2016—teenagers from a
    small Macedonian mountain town called Veles—were back in the game. How had Facebook’s
    news distribution system been manipulated by kids in a country with a per capita
    GDP of $5,800?

    viral. This was odd. Competition for space in users’ News Feeds meant that most
    pages couldn’t reliably get their posts in front of even those people who deliberately
    chose to follow them. But with the help of reshares and the News Feed algorithms,
    the Macedonian troll farms were routinely reaching huge audiences. If having a
    post go viral was hitting the attention jackpot, then the Macedonians were winning
    every time they put a buck into Facebook’s slot machine.

    every post was either aggregated or stolen from somewhere else on the internet.
    Usually such material came from Reddit or Twitter, but the Macedonians were just
    ripping off content from other Facebook pages, too, and reposting it to their
    far larger audiences. This worked because, on Facebook, originality wasn’t an
    asset; it was a liability. Even for talented content creators, most posts turned
    out to be duds. But things that had already gone viral nearly always would do
    so again.

    “The mission of Facebook is to empower people to build community. This is a good
    mission,” he wrote, before arguing that the behavior he was describing exploited
    attempts to do that. As an example, Allen compared a real community—a group known
    as the National Congress of American Indians. The group had clear leaders, produced
    original programming, and held offline events for Native Americans. But, despite
    NCAI’s earnest efforts, it had far fewer fans than a page titled “Native American
    Proub” [sic] that was run out of Vietnam. The page’s unknown administrators were
    using recycled content to promote a website that sold T-shirts.

    even if users liked the content, they would never choose to follow a Native American
    pride page that was secretly run out of Vietnam. As proof, he included an appendix
    of reactions from users who had wised up. “If you’d like to read 300 reviews from
    real users who are very upset about pages that exploit the Native American community,
    here is a collection of 1 star reviews on Native American ‘Community’ and ‘Media’
    pages,” he concluded.

    anyone interested in gaming Facebook content distribution (Dairy Queen franchises

    that the subject remained “an albatross public narrative,” with Facebook accused
    of “driving societies into contexts where they can’t trust each other, can’t share
    common ground, can’t have conversations about issues, and can’t share a common

    happy to report that a thorough review of the available evidence showed that this
    “media narrative” was unfounded. The evidence that social media played a contributing
    role in polarization, they wrote, was “mixed at best.” Though Facebook likely
    wasn’t at fault, Cox and Raychoudhury wrote, the company was still trying to help,
    in part by encouraging people to join Facebook groups. “We believe that groups
    are on balance a positive, depolarizing force,” the review stated.

    released Facebook research that the company’s own staff had concluded was no longer
    accurate. At the same time, it omitted the company’s past conclusions, affirmed
    in another literature review just ten months before, that Facebook’s recommendation
    systems encouraged bombastic rhetoric from publishers and politicians, as well
    as previous work finding that seeing vicious posts made users report “more anger
    towards people with different social, political, or cultural beliefs.” While nobody
    could reliably say how Facebook altered users’ off-platform behavior, how the
    company shaped their social media activity was accepted fact. “The more misinformation
    a person is exposed to on Instagram the more trust they have in the information
    they see on Instagram,” company researchers had concluded in late 2020.

    100,000 users in nine countries about negative social comparison on Instagram.
    The researchers then paired the answers with individualized data on how each user
    who took the survey had behaved on Instagram, including how and what they posted.
    They found that, for a sizable minority of users, especially those in Western
    countries, Instagram was a rough place. Ten percent reported that they “often
    or always” felt worse about themselves after using the platform, and a quarter
    believed Instagram made negative comparison worse.

    did not. They found that “people feel worse when they see more celebrities in

    Rock” Johnson was no trouble at all. They found that people judged themselves
    far more harshly against friends than celebrities. A movie star’s post needed
    10,000 likes before it caused social comparison, whereas, for a peer, the number
