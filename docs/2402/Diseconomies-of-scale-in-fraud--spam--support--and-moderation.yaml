    to sell me a real SD card and not some fake, Amazon or my local Best Buy?", of
    course the answer is that I trust my local Best Buy more than Amazon, which is
    notorious for selling counterfeit SD cards. And if I ask who do I trust more,
    my local reputable electronics shop (Memory Express, B&H Photo, etc.), I trust
    my local reputable electronics shop more. Not only are they [less likely to](https://www.pentaxforums.com/forums/22-pentax-camera-field-accessories/53884-counterfeit-sandisk-extreme-iii-sdhc-best-buy.html)

    a higher rate of scams, spam, fraudulent content, etc., [smaller platform] or
    [larger platform]"? Generally the answer is [larger platform]. Of course, there
    are more total small platforms out there and they're higher variance, so I could
    deliberately use a smaller platform that's worse, but I'm choosing good options
    instead of bad options, in every size class, the smaller platform is generally
    better. For example, with Signal vs. WhatsApp, I've literally never received a
    spam Signal message, whereas I get spam WhatsApp messages somewhat regularly.
    Or if I compare places I might read tech content on, if I compare tiny forums
    no one's heard of to lobste.rs, lobste.rs has a very slightly higher rate (rate
    as in fraction of messages I see, not absolute message volume) of bad content
    because it's zero on the private forums and very low but non-zero on lobste.rs.
    And then if I compare lobste.rs to a somewhat larger platform, like Hacker News
    or mastodon.social, those have (again very slightly) higher rates of scam/spam/fraudulent
    content. And then if I compare that to mid-sized social media platforms, like
    reddit, reddit has a significantly higher and noticeable rate of bad content.
    And then if I can compare reddit to the huge platforms like YouTube, Facebook,
    [Google search results](/seo-spam/), these larger platforms have an even higher
    rate of scams/spam/fraudulent content. And, as with the SD card example, the odds
    of getting decent support go down as the platform size goes up as well. In the
    event of an incorrect suspension or ban from the platform, the odds of an account
    getting reinstated get worse as the platform gets larger.

    scam content on Facebook than on Twitter. [For example, when I clicked through

    that nearly everyone can agree is bad (such as bitcoin scams, spam for fake pharmaceutical
    products, [fake weather forecasts](/seo-spam/), adults sending photos of their
    genitals to children), etc., large platforms do worse than small ones. The second
    is that, for the user, errors are much more costly and less fixable as companies
    get bigger because support generally becomes worse. [The third is that, as platforms
    scale up, a larger fraction of users will strongly disagree about what should
    be allowed on the platform](/impossible-agree/).

    the [cocktail party idea](/cocktail-ideas/) that they'll have the best moderation
    because they have the most resources is countered by the equally simplistic idea
    that they'll have the worst moderation because they're the juiciest targets or
    that they'll have the worst moderation because they'll have worst fragmentation
    due to the standard diseconomies of scale that occur when you scale up organizations
    and problem domains. Whether or not the company having more resources or these
    other factors dominate is too complex to resolve theoretically, but can observe
    the result empirically. At least at [the level of resources that big companies
    choose to devote to moderation, spam, etc.](https://mastodon.social/@danluu/109919312448235105),
    having the larger target and other problems associated with scale dominate.

    enough resources to significantly reduce this problem, they have chosen not to
    do this. For example, in the last year before I wrote this sentence, Meta's last-year
    profit before tax (through December 2023) was $47B. If Meta had a version of the
    internal vision statement of a power company a friend mine worked for ("Reliable
    energy, at low cost, for generations.") and operated like that power company did,
    trying to create a good experience for the user instead of maximizing profit plus
    creating the metaverse, they could've spent the $50B they spent on the metaverse
    on moderation platforms and technology and then spent $30k/yr (which would result
    in a very good income in most countries where moderators are hired today, allowing
    them to have their pick of who to hire) on 1.6 million additional full-time staffers
    for things like escalations and support, on the order of one additional moderator
    or support staffer per few thousand users (and of course diseconomies of scale
    apply to managing this many people). I'm not saying that Meta or Google should
    do this, just that whenever someone at big tech company says [something like](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38614042)
    "these systems have to be fully automated because no one could afford to operate
    manual systems at our scale", what's really being said is more along the lines
    of "we would not be able to generate as many billions a year in profit if we hired
    enough competent people to manually review cases our system should flag as ambiguous,
    so we settle for what we can get without compromising profits". One can defend
    that choice, but it is a choice.

    where economies of scale legitimately make the experience better for users. For
    example, when we looked at [why it's so hard to buy things that work well](/nothing-works/),
    we noted that Amazon's economies of scale have enabled them to build out their
    own package delivery service that is, while flawed, still more reliable than is
    otherwise available (and this has only improved since they added the ability for
    users to rate each delivery, which no other major package delivery service has).
    Similarly, Apple's scale and vertical integration has allowed them to [build one
    of the all-time great performance teams](https://mastodon.social/@danluu/111064942895424216)
    (as measured by normalized performance relative to competitors of the same era),
    not only wiping the floor with the competition on benchmarks, but also providing
    a better experience in ways that no one really measured until recently, like [device
    latency](/input-lag/). For a more mundane example of economies of scale, crackers
    and other food that ships well are cheaper on Amazon than in my local grocery
    store. It's easy to name ways in which economies of scale benefit the user, but
    this doesn't mean that we should assume that economies of scale dominate diseconomies
    of scale in all areas. Although it's beyond the scope of this post, if we're going
    to talk about whether or not users are better off if companies are larger or smaller,
    we should look at what gets better when companies get bigger and what gets worse,
    not just assume that everything will get better just because some things get better
    (or vice versa).

    on moderation, spam, anti-fraud, etc., vs. the reality that they choose to spend
    those resources elsewhere, like dropping $50B on the Metaverse and not hiring
    1.6 million moderators and support staff that they could afford to hire, it makes
    sense to look at how much effort is being expended. Meta's involvement in Myanmar
    makes for a nice case study because Erin Kissane wrote up a fairly detailed [40,000
    word account of what happened](https://erinkissane.com/meta-in-myanmar-full-series).
    The entirety of what happened is a large and complicated issue ([see appendix
    for more discussion](#appendix-erin-kissane-on-meta-in-myanmar)) but, for the
    main topic of this post, the key components are that there was an issue that most
    people can generally agree should be among the highest priority moderation and
    support issues and that, despite repeated, extremely severe and urgent, warnings
    to Meta staff at various levels (engineers, directors, VPs, execs, etc.), almost
    no resources were dedicated to the issue while internal documents indicate that
    only a small fraction of agreed-upon bad content was caught by their systems (on
    the order of a few percent). I don't think this is unique to Meta and this matches
    my experience with other large tech companies, both as a user of their products
    and as an employee.

    Mastodon is big enough that you can find some scams if you go looking for them,

    frequently, perhaps an average of once every few weeks in my normal feed. On Facebook,

    aren't sufficient to match the problems, even in cases where people would generally

    call up a buddy of theirs at Google to get support because the standard support
    is often completely ineffective. And this isn't unique to Google — at another

- en: For example, there's a social media company that's famous for incorrectly banning
    users (at least 10% of people I know have lost an account due to incorrect bans
    and, if I search for a random person I don't know, there's a good chance I get
    multiple accounts for them, with some recent one that has a profile that reads
    "used to be @[some old account]", with no forward from the old account to the
    new one because they're now banned). When I ran into a senior engineer from the
    team that works on this stuff, I asked him why so many legitimate users get banned
    and he told me something like "that's not a problem, the real problem is that
    we don't ban enough accounts. Everyone who's banned deserves it, it's not worth
    listening to appeals or thinking about them". Of course it's true that [most content
    on every public platform is bad content, spam, etc.](https://twitter.com/danluu/status/964562384558927872),
    so if you have any sort of signal at all on whether or not something is bad content,
    when you look at it, it's likely to be bad content. But this doesn't mean the
    converse, that almost no users are banned incorrectly, is true. And if senior
    people on the team that classifies which content is bad have the attitude that
    we shouldn't worry about false positives because almost all flagged content is
    bad, we'll end up with a system that has a large number of false positives. I
    later asked around to see what had ever been done to reduce false positives in
    the fraud detection systems and found out that there was no systematic attempt
    at tracking false positives at all, no way to count cases where employees filed
    internal tickets to override bad bans, etc.; At the meta level, there was some
    mechanism to decrease the false negative rate (e.g., someone sees bad content
    that isn't being caught then adds something to catch more bad content) but, without
    any sort of tracking of false positives, there was effectively no mechanism to
    decrease the false positive rate. It's no surprise that this meta system resulted
    in over 10% of people I know getting incorrect suspensions or bans. And, as Patrick
    McKenzie says, the optimal rate of false positives isn't zero. But when you have
    engineers who have the attitude that they've done enough legwork that false positives
    are impossible, it's basically guaranteed that the false positive rate is higher
    than optimal. When you combine this with normal big company levels of support,
    it's a recipe for kafkaesque user experiences.

    seemed likely to result in false positive bans. An Uber TL immediately took me
    to task, saying that I was making unwarranted assumptions on how banning works,

    bans, there's extensive to review to make sure that bans are valid and, in fact,
    the false positive banning I was concerned about could never happen. And then
    I got effectively banned due to a false positive in a fraud detection system.
    [I was remind of that incident when Uber incorrectly banned a driver who had to
    take them to court to even get information on why he was banned, at which point

    which is subtitled How Certain Schemes to Improve the Human World Have Failed.
    A key concept from the book is "legibility", what a state can see, and how this
    distorts what states do. One could easily write a highly analogous book, Seeing
    like a Tech Company about what's illegible to companies that scale up, at least
    as companies are run today. A simple example of this is that, in many video games,
    including ones made by game studios that are part of a $3T company, it's easy
    to get someone suspended or banned by having a bunch of people report the account
    for bad behavior. What's legible to the game company is the rate of reports and
    what's not legible is the player's actual behavior (it could be legible, but the
    company chooses not to have enough people or skilled enough people examine actual
    behavior); [and many people have reported similar bannings with social media companies](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31581510).
    When it comes to things like anti-fraud systems, what's legible to the company
    tends to be fairly illegible to humans, even humans working on the anti-fraud
    systems themselves.

    (submissions) page while logged in, you'll see a steady stream of automatically
    killed stories from these hellbanned users. While there are quite a few of them,
    the percentage is generally well under half. When we looked at a "mid-sized" big
    tech company like Twitter circa 2017, based on the public numbers, if spam bots
    were hellbanned instead of removed, spam is so much more prevalent that all you'd
    see if you were able to see it. And, as big companies go, 2017-Twitter isn't that
    big. As we also noted, the former PM of FB ads targeting explained that numbers
    as low as 100M are in the "I can't count that low" range, too small to care about;

    indeed, the majority of DMs I get are obvious spam). Either you have to back off
    and only ban users in cases where you're extremely confident, or you ban all your
    users after not too long and, as companies like to handle support, appealing means
    that you'll get a response saying that "your case was carefully reviewed and we

    about this, it's apparent that it can be done much better. While I was writing
    this post, I actually did support at a company that does support decently well
    (for a tech company, adjusted for size, I'd say they're well above [99%-ile](/p95-skill/)),
    including going through the training and onboarding process for support folks.
    [Executing anything well at scale is non-trivial](/sounds-easy/), so I don't mean
    to downplay how good their support org is, but the most striking thing to me was
    how much of the effectiveness of the org naturally followed from caring about
    providing a good support experience for the user. A full discussion of what that
    means is too long to include here, so we'll look at this in more detail another
    time, but one example is that, when we look at how big company support responds,
    it's often designed to discourage the user from responding ("this review is final")
    or to justify, putatively to the user, that the company is doing an adequate job
    ("this was not a purely automated process and each appeal was reviewed by humans
    in a robust process that ... "). This company's training instructs you to do the
    opposite of the standard big company "please go away"-style and "we did a great
    job and have a robust process, therefore complaints are invalid"-style responses.
    For every anti-pattern you commonly see in support, the training tells you to
    do the opposite and discusses why the anti-pattern results in a bad user experience.
    Moreover, the culture has deeply absorbed these ideas (or rather, these ideas
    come out of the culture) and there are processes for ensuring that people really
    know what it means to provide good support and follow through on it, support folks
    have ways to directly talk to the developers who are implementing the product,
    etc.

    in support orgs that are good at helping users or even try working in one before
    explaining how it's impossible to do better, but this generally isn't done. Their
    company's support org leadership could do this as well, or do what I did and actually
    directly work in a support role in an effective support org, but this doesn't
    happen. If you're a cynic, this all makes sense. In the same way that cynics advise
    junior employees "big company HR isn't there to help you; their job is to protect
    the company", a cynic can credibly argue "big company support isn't there to help
    the user; their job is to protect the company", so of course big companies don't
    try to understand how companies that are good at supporting users do support because
    that's not what big company support is for.

    noted at the start where, in a poll of my Twitter followers, people who mostly
    work in tech and are generally fairly technically savvy, only [2.6% of people
    thought that the biggest companies were the best at moderation and spam/fraud
    filtering](https://twitter.com/danluu/status/1570604630350106624), so it might
    seem a bit silly to spend so much time belaboring the point. When you sample the
    U.S population at large, a larger fraction of people say they believe in conspiracy
    theories like vaccines putting a microchip in you or that we never landed on the
    moon, and I don't spend my time explaining why vaccines do not actually put a
    microchip in you or why it's reasonable to think that we landed on the moon. One
    reason that would perhaps be reasonable is that I've been watching the "only big
    companies can handle these issues" rhetoric with concern as it catches on among
    non-technical people, like regulators, lawmakers, and [high-ranking government

    Maybe next time you run into a lay person who tells you that only the largest

    there's very strong consensus the other way among tech folks.

    zero scams, spam, etc. The strategy for this is simple; the owner of the channel
    reads every message and bans and scammers or spammers who show up. When you get
    to a bigger site, like lobste.rs, or even bigger like HN, that's too large for
    someone to read every message (well, this could be done for lobste.rs, but considering
    that it's a spare-time pursuit for the owner and the volume of messages, it's
    not reasonable to expect them to read every message in a short timeframe), but
    there's still a single person who provides the vision for what should happen,
    even if the sites are large enough that it's not reasonable to literally read
    every message. The "no vehicles in the park" problem doesn't apply here because
    a person decides what the policies should be. You might not like those policies,
    but you're welcome to find another small forum or start your own (and this is
    actually how lobste.rs got started — under [HN's previous moderation regime, which

    main pillars that drive growth. HN, which cares more about discussion quality
    than growth, tries to detect and suppress these (with exceptions like criticism
    of HN itself, of YC companies like Stripe, etc., to ensure a lack of bias). Any
    social media site that aims to grow does the opposite; they implement a ranked
    feed that puts the content that is most enraging and most engaging in front of
    the people its algorithms predict will be the most enraged and engaged by it.
    For example, let's say you're in a country with very high racial/religious/factonal
    tensions, with regular calls for violence, etc. What's the most engaging content?
    Well, that would be content calling for the death of your enemies, so you get
    things a livestream of someone calling for the death of the other faction and
    then grabbing someone and beating them shown to a lot of people. After all, what's
    more engaging than a beatdown of your sworn enemy? A theme of Broken Code is that
    someone will find some harmful content they want to suppress, but then get overruled
    because that would reduce engagement and growth. HN has no such goal, so it has
    no problem suppressing or eliminating content that HN deems to be harmful.

    the most sophisticated attacks. I've seen this used as a justification for why
    big companies seem to have worst anti-spam and anti-fraud than a forum like HN.
    While it's likely true that big companies are subject to the most sophisticated

    Facebook account and post obvious scams for months to years, with extremely markers
    that they're scams, many people replying in concern that the account has been
    taken over and is running scams (unlike working in support and spamming reddit,
    I didn't try taking over people's Facebook accounts, but given people's password
    practices, it's very easy to take over an account, and given how Facebook responds
    to these takeovers when a friend's account is taken over, we can see that attacks
    that do the most naive thing possible, with zero sophistication, are not defeated),

    of reddit would have more sophisticated anti-spam systems than HN, which has a
    single person who both writes the code for the anti-spam systems and does the
    moderation. But the most naive and simplistic tricks you might use to put content
    on the front page work on reddit and don't work on HN. I'm not saying you can't
    defeat HN's system, but doing so would take a little bit of thought, which is
    not the case for reddit and Facebook. And likewise for support, where once you
    start talking to people about how to run a support org that's good for users,
    you immediately see that the most obvious things have not been seriously tried

    on Myanmar (hereafter just “the UN Mission”) called a “determining role” in the
    bloody emergence of what would become the genocide of the Rohingya people in Myanmar.2'

    debatable—it was content moderation fuckups, right? In a country they weren’t
    paying much attention to? Unethical and probably negligent, but come on, what
    tech company isn’t, at some point?

    the claim that Facebook played a "determining role" in genocide are correct, but
    at a meta-level (no pun intended), it seems plausible. Every comment I've seen
    that aims to be a direction refutation of Erin's position is actually pre-refuted
    by Erin in Erin's text, so it appears that very few people who are publicly commenting
    who disagree with Erin read the articles before commenting (or they've read them
    and failed to understand what Erin is saying) and, instead, are disagreeing based
    on something other than the actual content. [It reminds me a bit of the responses
    to David Jackson's proof of the four color theorem. Some people thought it was,
    finally, a proof, and others thought it wasn't.](https://twitter.com/danluu/status/1605675278822703104).
    Something I found interesting at the time was that the people who thought it wasn't
    a proof had read the paper and thought it seemed flawed, whereas the people who
    thought it was a proof were going off of signals like David's track record or
    the prestige of his institution. At the time, without having read the paper myself,
    I guessed (with low confidence) that the proof was incorrect based on the meta-heuristic
    that thoughts from people who read the paper were stronger evidence than things
    like prestige. Similarly, I would guess that Erin's summary is at least roughly
    accurate and that Erin's endorsement of the UN HRC fact-finding mission is correct,
    although I have lower confidence in this than in my guess about the proof because
    making a positive claim like this is harder than finding a flaw and the area is
    one where evaluating a claim is significantly trickier.

    couldn't believe that Facebook could be instrumental in something that bad. Ironically,

    Bejar was head of engineering. And, if you read the entire set of articles, you'll
    see references like "Susan Benesch, head of the Dangerous Speech Project" and
    "the head of Deloitte in Myanmar", so it appears that the reason that Erin said
    that "one of Facebook’s heads of engineering" is that Erin is using the term head
    colloquially here (and note that the it isn't capitalized, as a title might be),
    to mean that Arturo was in charge of something.

    at a big tech company, the term Head of Engineering will generally call to mind
    an executive who all engineers transitively report into (or, in cases where there
    are large pillars, perhaps one of a few such people). Someone who's fluent in
    internal tech company lingo would probably not use this phrasing, even when writing
    for lay people, but this isn't strong evidence of factual errors in the article
    even if, in an ideal world, journalists would be fluent in the domain-specific

    to reduce the odds that I would be locked out, because the documentation indicated
    that I would need any of my 2FA methods to be available to not get locked out;
    in fact, this is false, and Google will sometimes only let you authenticate with

    had a video didn't upload and support's recommendation was to try editing the
    video again and uploading it again. Keeley asked support why that would fix it
    and the answer was basically, there's no particular reason to think that it might
    fix it, but it might also just work to re-upload the video. Another time, Keeley
    got "hacked" and went to support. Support once again responded quickly, but all

    hand, it could also be an early engineering sample with all sorts of bugs or other
    issues; when I worked for a CPU company, we would buy Intel CPUs to test them
    and engineering samples would not only have a variety of bugs that only manifested
    in certain circumstances, they would sometimes have instructions that did completely
    different things that could be reasonable behavior, except that Intel had changed
    the specified behavior before release, so the CPU would just do the wrong thing,
    resulting in crashes on real software (this happened with the first CPU we were
    able to get that had the `MWAIT` instruction, an engineering sample that was apparently
    from before Intel had finalized the current behavior of `MWAIT`).

    accounts, bald-faced lies on campaign-controlled pages, and coordinated threats
    of violence against Duterte critics. After years in politics, Harbath wasn’t naive
    about dirty tricks. But when Duterte won, it was impossible to deny that Facebook’s
    platform had rewarded his combative and sometimes underhanded brand of politics.
    The president-elect banned independent media from his inauguration—but livestreamed
    the event on Facebook. His promised extrajudicial killings began soon after.

    sentiment and outright lies. As in the Philippines, the insurgent tactics seemed
    to thrive on Facebook—supporters of the “Leave” camp had obliterated “Remain”
    supporters on the platform. ... Harbath found all that to be gross, but there
    was no denying that Trump was successfully using Facebook and Twitter to short-circuit
    traditional campaign coverage, garnering attention in ways no campaign ever had.
    “I mean, he just has to go and do a short video on Facebook or Instagram and then
    the media covers it,” Harbath had marveled during a talk in Europe that spring.
    She wasn’t wrong: political reporters reported not just the content of Trump’s
    posts but their like counts.'

    on the platform—but it certainly wasn’t the majority of content. Numerically,
    falsehoods accounted for just a fraction of all news viewed on Facebook, and news
    itself was just a fraction of the platform’s overall content. That such a fraction
    of a fraction could have thrown the election was downright illogical, Zuckerberg
    insisted.. ... But Zuckerberg was the boss. Ignoring Kornblut’s advice, he made
    his case the following day during a live interview at Techonomy, a conference
    held at the Ritz-Carlton in Half Moon Bay. Calling fake news a “very small” component
    of the platform, he declared the possibility that it had swung the election “a
    crazy idea.” ... A favorite saying at Facebook is that “Data Wins Arguments.”
    But when it came to Zuckerberg’s argument that fake news wasn’t a major problem
    on Facebook, the company didn’t have any data. As convinced as the CEO was that
    Facebook was blameless, he had no evidence of how “fake news” came to be, how
    it spread across the platform, and whether the Trump campaign had made use of
    it in their Facebook ad campaigns. ... One week after the election, BuzzFeed News
    reporter Craig Silverman published an analysis showing that, in the final months
    of the election, fake news had been the most viral election-related content on
    Facebook. A story falsely claiming that the pope had endorsed Trump had gotten
    more than 900,000 likes, reshares, and comments—more engagement than even the
    most widely shared stories from CNN, the New York Times, or the Washington Post.
    The most popular falsehoods, the story showed, had been in support of Trump.

    an outgrowth of the fake news publishers that Facebook had battled in the wake
    of the 2016 election. While fact-checks and other crackdown efforts had made it
    far harder for outright hoaxes to go viral, the publishers had regrouped. Some
    of the same entities that BuzzFeed had written about in 2016—teenagers from a
    small Macedonian mountain town called Veles—were back in the game. How had Facebook’s
    news distribution system been manipulated by kids in a country with a per capita
    GDP of $5,800?

    viral. This was odd. Competition for space in users’ News Feeds meant that most
    pages couldn’t reliably get their posts in front of even those people who deliberately
    chose to follow them. But with the help of reshares and the News Feed algorithms,
    the Macedonian troll farms were routinely reaching huge audiences. If having a
    post go viral was hitting the attention jackpot, then the Macedonians were winning
    every time they put a buck into Facebook’s slot machine.

    every post was either aggregated or stolen from somewhere else on the internet.
    Usually such material came from Reddit or Twitter, but the Macedonians were just
    ripping off content from other Facebook pages, too, and reposting it to their
    far larger audiences. This worked because, on Facebook, originality wasn’t an
    asset; it was a liability. Even for talented content creators, most posts turned
    out to be duds. But things that had already gone viral nearly always would do
    so again.

    “The mission of Facebook is to empower people to build community. This is a good
    mission,” he wrote, before arguing that the behavior he was describing exploited
    attempts to do that. As an example, Allen compared a real community—a group known
    as the National Congress of American Indians. The group had clear leaders, produced
    original programming, and held offline events for Native Americans. But, despite
    NCAI’s earnest efforts, it had far fewer fans than a page titled “Native American
    Proub” [sic] that was run out of Vietnam. The page’s unknown administrators were
    using recycled content to promote a website that sold T-shirts.

    even if users liked the content, they would never choose to follow a Native American
    pride page that was secretly run out of Vietnam. As proof, he included an appendix
    of reactions from users who had wised up. “If you’d like to read 300 reviews from
    real users who are very upset about pages that exploit the Native American community,
    here is a collection of 1 star reviews on Native American ‘Community’ and ‘Media’
    pages,” he concluded.

    anyone interested in gaming Facebook content distribution (Dairy Queen franchises

    points to an opposite conclusion.” Facebook, it turned out, fed false information
    to senior citizens at such a massive rate that they consumed far more of it despite
    spending less time on the platform. Rather than vindicating Facebook, the researchers
    wrote, “the stronger growth of polarization for older users may be driven in part
    by Facebook use.”

    titled “You and the Algorithm: It Takes Two to Tango,” he cited the internally

    “media narrative” was unfounded. The evidence that social media played a contributing
    role in polarization, they wrote, was “mixed at best.” Though Facebook likely
    wasn’t at fault, Cox and Raychoudhury wrote, the company was still trying to help,
    in part by encouraging people to join Facebook groups. “We believe that groups
    are on balance a positive, depolarizing force,” the review stated.

    in another literature review just ten months before, that Facebook’s recommendation
    systems encouraged bombastic rhetoric from publishers and politicians, as well
    as previous work finding that seeing vicious posts made users report “more anger
    towards people with different social, political, or cultural beliefs.” While nobody
    could reliably say how Facebook altered users’ off-platform behavior, how the
    company shaped their social media activity was accepted fact. “The more misinformation
    a person is exposed to on Instagram the more trust they have in the information
    they see on Instagram,” company researchers had concluded in late 2020.

    100,000 users in nine countries about negative social comparison on Instagram.
    The researchers then paired the answers with individualized data on how each user
    who took the survey had behaved on Instagram, including how and what they posted.
    They found that, for a sizable minority of users, especially those in Western
    countries, Instagram was a rough place. Ten percent reported that they “often
    or always” felt worse about themselves after using the platform, and a quarter
    believed Instagram made negative comparison worse.

    Rock” Johnson was no trouble at all. They found that people judged themselves
    far more harshly against friends than celebrities. A movie star’s post needed
