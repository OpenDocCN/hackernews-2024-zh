    *[The Atlantic](https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/contra-the-atlantic-on-polyamory)*[’s
    recent invective against polyamory](https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/contra-the-atlantic-on-polyamory)
    (subscriber-only post, sorry). Today I want to zoom away from the specific bad
    arguments and examine the overall form of the article.

- en: 'The overall form was: “I read a memoir about polyamory, everyone involved seemed
    awful and unhappy, and now I hate polyamorous people.” This is a common pattern.
    Sometimes, if someone’s very careful, they read three or four books about polyamory.
    Everyone in all the books is awful and unhappy. *Then* they conclude they hate
    polyamorous people.'

    naturally and effortlessly. You walk so gracefully that a million man-hours into
    bipedal robots fail to match your skill. But if some stroke patient or precocious
    one-year-old asked your secret, you would just say “I put one foot in front of
    the other.”

    They experience walking as a constant battle to overcome their natural constitution,
    and so accumulate tips and tricks throughout their lives. Or ask a physical therapist
    who works with these people and studies them. Just don’t ask someone you see walking
    especially briskly down the street.

    married for fifty years, and they’ll give you vapid old-person advice like “Treat
    every day as a gift from God.” But go to someone who’s struggled with every one
    of their last thirty-seven relationships, and they’ll be full of suggestions!
    They’ll tell you all sorts of fascinating things about boundaries and gaslighting
    and the four-hundred-and-ninety-four principles of nonviolent communication.

    mean, I think that’s true to some degree. But also, people who start off as normal
    bad relationship partners improve piecemeal, through gradient descent on a thousand
    little interactions too small to notice or generalize over. It’s only after this
    process fails that people seek legible principles.

    honestly tried their hardest at relationships and still feel like they need to
    do better, maybe because they have limited social skills and have to deliberately
    study what other people absorb naturally. Probably some of the legible principles
    people have come up with genuinely help these people. If you’re in this situation,
    reading the legible principles might help you too.

    the same as taking an ataxic’s advice on walking. You’ll overthink it and trip
    over your own feet. If you persist, you’ll settle into a stilted and unnatural
    walking style that was worse than what you did before.

    Veaux and Eve Rickert. A few years after it was written, Eve and three of Franklin’s
    other partners accused him of abuse, which he vehemently denied and turned back
    on her. Every so often I check to see how things are going, and one of them has
    come up with some new volley against the other.

- en: In retrospect, I think it’s not surprising that the best-known relationship
    advice book was written by people in a terrible relationship. Terrible relationships
    have a way of making you overanalyze your relationship dynamics. They encourage
    you to come up with lots of strategies for dealing with conflict, given all the
    conflict you’re constantly getting into. They happen when you’re the sort of person
    who over-promises and under-delivers, which is also the kind of person who can
    write an exciting-sounding book shilling something.

    something wrong with the author, and then apply that to polyamorous people in

    kind of navel-gazey. It was the work of someone who had fallen too deep into the
    self-help ethos of examining every one of their experiences to see if it was maximally
    resonant with their True Self.

    times to write a memoir, like when you’ve just conquered Gaul. But usually memoir-writing
    means you think your True Self is absolutely fascinating and your experiences
    are worth recording and analyzing at book length.

    boyfriend, feeling the gap between England and California close. In the afternoons,
    I went to the comedy festival, where I felt more me than I had in months, indulging
    the person I was and the things I liked. One night, I watched comedy band The
    Lonely Island, laughing in a crowd alone as they brought out Michael Bolton and
    T-Pain.

    are other parts of the memoir that are deeper and more central to the core of
    human experience. And in between doing the deep and important things, this person
    went to Whole Foods, and included that detail to specify that this one day was
    ordinary and happy. On a rational level, I can’t fault this person at all.

    I’m not endorsing this contempt, and for all I know the writer might be great).
    If you write this kind of thing in a memoir, and it claims (even as subtext) that
    you’re a deep and interesting person, then readers are going to make fun of you.

    a popular memoir as a claim to status. Such a claim needs to be backed up - either
    by conquering Gaul, or at least by being so good at writing that you can elevate
    the humdrum existence of Whole Foods shopping trips and FaceTime sessions into
    transcendent poetry. And if you’re a particular type of bad person (which I am),
    your bar will be so high that nobody meets it. Then you’ll be left feeling vaguely
    offended by this person and their dumb annoying Whole-Foods-shopping, FaceTime-session-having
    ways. And if you’re bad at attributing your emotions, you might think you hate
    FaceTime as a communication protocol.

    political; in a country where gay marriage was still an active political issue,
    marrying as a gay person would clearly be choosing a side. Still, there’s a range
    of how much people want to treat their romantic relationships as making political
    statements. And without condemning it on a philosophical level, *on a*  *psychological*  *level*
    the people at the far end of this range can be pretty weird.

    has necessarily won a Darwinian battle among hyper-specialized memetic replicators
    competing for your attention. By definition most of what you come across through
    semi-formal channels will be preachy, pushy, and associated with the kind of people
    who are obsessed with talking about themselves. If you learn about some lifestyles
    through informal channels (eg your family and friends), and others through semiformal
    channels (eg media and books), the latter will look obviously inferior.
