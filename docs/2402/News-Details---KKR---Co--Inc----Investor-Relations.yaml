    KKR & Co. Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries (collectively “KKR”), including
    certain investment funds, vehicles and accounts that are managed by KKR (each,
    a “fund”). Forward-looking statements relate to expectations, beliefs, projections,
    future plans and strategies, anticipated events or trends and similar expressions
    concerning matters that are not historical facts. The forward-looking statements
    are based on KKR’s beliefs, assumptions and expectations of its future performance,
    taking into account all information currently available to it. These beliefs,
    assumptions and expectations can change as a result of many possible events or
    factors, not all of which are known to KKR or are within its control. If a change
    occurs, KKR’s business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations,
    including but not limited to, assets under management, fee paying assets under
    management, after-tax distributable earnings, capital invested, syndicated capital,
    uncalled commitments, cash and short-term investments, fee related earnings, fee
    and yield segment EBITDA, core interest expense and book value, may vary materially
    from those expressed in the forward-looking statements. The following factors,
    among others, could cause actual results to vary from the forward-looking statements:
    whether KKR realizes all or any of the anticipated benefits from converting to
    a corporation and the timing of realizing such benefits; whether there are increased
    or unforeseen costs associated with the conversion, including any adverse change
    in tax law; the volatility of the capital markets; the general volatility of the
    capital markets; failure to realize the benefits of or changes in KKR’s business
    strategies including the ability to realize the anticipated synergies from acquisitions
    or strategic partnerships or other transactions; availability, terms and deployment
    of capital; availability of qualified personnel and expense of recruiting and
    retaining such personnel; changes in the asset management industry, interest rates
    or the general economy; underperformance of KKR''s investments and decreased ability
    to raise funds; and the degree and nature of KKR’s competition. All forward-looking
    statements speak only as of the date they are made. KKR does not undertake any
    obligation to update any forward-looking statements to reflect circumstances or
    events that occur after the date on which such statements were made except as
    required by law. In addition, KKR’s business strategy is focused on the long-term
    and financial results are subject to significant volatility.'
