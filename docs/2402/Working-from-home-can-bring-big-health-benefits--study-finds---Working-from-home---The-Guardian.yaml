    study’s authors, said the study showed that workers and employers needed to start
    considering home working with the same seriousness as they did office working.

    in the same room with no sound-proofing, it was all unpleasant and you didn’t
    have a very productive workforce,” he said.

- en: The review, published in the *Journal of Occupational Health*, identified three
    themes – the working environment at home, the effect on workers’ lives and careers,
    and the effect on their health. Greenberg said the research showed that there
    were winners and losers in many areas of home working. The working environment
    depended on how much space there was at home, the available equipment and on how
    much control workers had over their day.

    responsibilities at home such as childcare or housework – often women and those
    living alone – tended to be more stressed.

    good for creative things, but much more difficult dealing with tedious matters.
    A lot of people worried about career prospects – this feeling that if you’re not
    present in the office, you’re going to get overlooked.”

    was linked “with an increase in intake of vegetables, fruit, dairy, snacks, and
    self-made meals; younger workers and females benefited the most in terms of healthier
    eating,” the paper said.

    the problem and actually think about solutions,” he said. “We know quite a lot
    now. So we need to ask ‘what is the best training for an individual who’s going
    to become a partial homeworker?’ What we don’t need to do is to ask ‘would it
    be helpful to train someone to homework?’ The answer is clearly yes.”

    that employees return to the office full-time, with firms such as JP Morgan requiring
    managers to be in five days a week.

    and makes companies less flexible in the event of future crises, such as another
    health emergency or strikes or severe weather conditions that prevent people from
