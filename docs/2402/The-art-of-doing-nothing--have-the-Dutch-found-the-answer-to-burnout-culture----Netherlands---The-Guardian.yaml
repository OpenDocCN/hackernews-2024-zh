    in the act of *niksen*, the Dutch term for doing absolutely nothing. I try not
    to think about whether I am really doing nothing if I am standing on a beach.
    Maybe I should be sitting down? But then I would be sitting down. How do you niksen
    *properly*? Being effortlessly aimless next to me is Olga Mecking, the author
    of Niksen: Embracing the Dutch Art of Doing Nothing. In the three years since
    the book was published, she has become the Netherlands’ go-to authority on doing
    sod all. I suddenly remember there is a pancake house back on the promenade. Does
    eating pancakes count as doing nothing, or is it too much like doing something?
    Maybe I am not cut out for niksen.'

    I use in the book is: to do nothing, without a purpose. Not watching a movie,
    not scrolling social media, not reading emails. We always have in mind some kind
    of outcome. When we prepare meals, we think, ‘This meal will help me lose weight
    or will make me healthier.’ If we go for a walk, it has to be part of our 10,000
    steps. So we lose that fun of just eating or just walking. So it’s about letting
    go of the outcome.”'

    to a German and lives in The Hague. Although she speaks Dutch fluently, she is
    Polish. She first encountered the expression niksen in a free supermarket magazine
    in 2018\. She was intrigued that there was no similar verb in any other language
    she knew. She pitched niksen to the New York Times. When the article – [The Case
    for Doing Nothing](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/29/smarter-living/the-case-for-doing-nothing.html)
    – was published in 2019, it went viral. Within weeks, she had a publishing deal.
    The book, designed to sit alongside books on *hygge* (the Danish art of cosiness)
    and *fika* (the Swedish art of the coffee break), came out just as the Netherlands
    went into its first hard lockdown in late 2020\. A typical Amazon review from
    that year? “Perfect reading if you are struggling with pandemic-related stress.”

    – which has more than 100 fitness clubs in the UK – announced it was launching
    [niksen classes](https://blog.davidlloyd.co.uk/what-is-niksen/) to help people
    “release tension”. The [announcement quoted Jan de Jonge](https://www.davidlloyd.co.uk/david-lloyd-leisure-press/niksen-january-campaign),
    a Dutch psychologist and “niksen expert”. “Wellness is so important in our hectic
    lives, and the Dutch, with their reputation of being laid-back and easy-going,
    like to niksen after a stressful day’s work.” Over on X, he does add that niksen

    “Niksen is a media concept, like Blue Monday,” says Ruut Veenhoven, an emeritus
    professor of social conditions for human happiness at Erasmus University Rotterdam.
    Blue Monday, the third Monday of January, was once thought to have been “calculated”
    to be “the most depressing day of the year”. It later emerged that the concept
    was dreamed up by a travel company. Niksen is not quite the same: no one is reminding
    you to book a package holiday. And Dutch people really do use the verb. Veenhoven
    admits that the amount of interest in the idea of niksen is telling. “We are typically
    the most happy when we are active. And in modern society there are lots of nice
    things to do. As a result, we do a lot. The pace of life is higher than in non-western
    societies and the level of life satisfaction is also high and keeps rising. And
    yet … A side-effect is that we get into time pressure. And we dream of more relaxation.”
    Niksen gives us what we crave: an explanation for what’s missing – the presence
    of nothing in our lives.'

    particularly keen on it. (“*L’art de ne remplir aucun objectif* …” sighs French
    Cosmopolitan – translated as “The art of not having to fulfil any objective …”)
    But just because niksen originated in the Netherlands does not mean the Dutch
    are particularly good at it. “Niksen seems to be considered as a concept in the
    whole world, except in the Netherlands,” says Carolien Hamming, the founder and
    CEO of CSR Centrum, a centre for research into stress and resilience just south
    of Utrecht. “It has nothing to do with our culture. On the contrary, we’re Calvinists
    and tell each other to work harder.”

    told her that the Dutch are not good at doing nothing. “We are raised with the
    belief that we must always be useful and helpful. Niksen is the devil from whom
    comes nothing good.” She doesn’t blame anyone for being interested in the idea,
    though, when stress and depression are on the rise. “Our brains are overloaded;
    we don’t know how to do nothing.”

    knew the word but didn’t feel they had any explanation as to what was Dutch about
    it. But they also made jokes: “Sorry, I’m too busy doing nothing to answer.” Mecking
    herself says that by the time she started writing her book on niksen, another
    publisher had commissioned another author to write on the same topic. The race
    was on, and her deadline was pulled forward. Hardly in the spirit of niksen.'

    any record of use of niksen in the Dutch language before the late 2010s. It is
    usually categorised as a reaction to relentless work culture which, as dictionary
    definitions go, seems curiously specific and suggests a recent coinage. I somehow
    don’t feel it would have been in the vocabulary of the great Dutch artists Vermeer,
    Rembrandt or Van Gogh, who all argued for the relentless pursuit of intense activity.
    It is peculiar, though, that this unusual verb (“to nothing”) surfaced in a country
    that generally regards itself as Calvinist and atheist. Like Hamming, Dutch friends
    all mumble about Calvinism when I bring up niksen: this branch of 16th-century
    Protestantism was fervently embraced in the Netherlands. And John Calvin’s values
    of hard work, frugality, self-discipline and “straightforwardness” are still highly
    evident.'

    When I was walking around The Hague attempting to nonchalantly do nothing, I found
    it odd that whether people were doing nothing or not, you can see straight into
    their houses. Openness, too, is a Calvinist hangover: “Look at me. I have nothing
    to hide.” It is a fascinatingly contradictory cultural impulse: be buttoned-up
    and follow the rules at all times but also be completely transparent. It’s a weird
    mix of being required to be regimented but also laid-back at the same time. No
    wonder you might want to introduce niksen into that mix, to give yourself a break.
    And no wonder niksen feels “not Dutch” but also somehow belongs here.'

    “burnout” is prevalent in the Netherlands. Last year, a wellbeing study by a health
    insurance company was widely cited in the Dutch press. The [Cigna Healthcare Vitality
    Study](https://www.cignaglobal.com/blog/thought-leadership/cigna-healthcare-vitality-study-2023)
    was based on 10,000 respondents in 12 markets across the world, including the
    US, Kenya, China and five European countries. The Netherlands came out top. Even
    though 90% of Dutch employees say they are burnt out, with 27% of people feeling
    tired and drained as a result, they were still the least stressed of all employees
    in the study. Although 64% of Dutch respondents experienced stress, this was significantly
    lower than Belgium, where the figure was 81%. Ruud Wassen, the chief marketing
    officer of Cigna, who is also Dutch, explains that stress levels are high across
    Europe after the pandemic and the Netherlands is consistent with that. However,
    “Dutch employees experience relatively less stress when it comes to worries about
    the cost of living, personal finances and uncertainty about the future.” When
    it comes to the main reason for the stress, though, the Netherlands is just the
    same as everywhere else, he says. “Too much work.”

    the Netherlands,” says Roel Fransen, a human resources manager at Oval, a company
    promoting workplace engagement based in Tilburg. A [2023 study](https://nltimes.nl/2023/11/13/one-five-workers-netherlands-struggling-burnout-symptoms-study#:~:text=One%20in%20five%20workers%20suffers,13%20to%2017%2C%20on%20Monday)
    by the Dutch not-for-profit research organisation TNO found that one in five workers
    in the Netherlands suffers from symptoms of burnout. “This is a significant increasefrom
    previous years,” says Fransen. “And it is thought to be due to a number of factors,
    including the increasing demands of work, the rise of the gig economy and changing
    attitudes towards work-life balance.”

    rates are lower than most. It’s that the very idea of burnout really stresses
    them out. “There are a number of responses to burnout that seem rooted in Dutch
    culture,” says Fransen. “For example, the Dutch have a strong sense of social
    solidarity, and this can help to reduce the stigma associated with burnout. The
    Dutch are often very ambitious, and many of us put a lot of pressure on ourselves
    to succeed. Dutch people may also be reluctant to take time off from work, even
    when sick. Additionally, the Dutch culture of *gezelligheid* (conviviality) can
    sometimes lead to social pressure to attend everything while trying to keep up
    with work and neglecting your own needs.” See what I mean about contradictory?
    Don’t stigmatise anything. Push yourself. Don’t take time off work. Attend all
    social gatherings and be convivial at them. Keep your curtains open at all times.
    It does sound to me that it is incredibly draining to be successfully Dutch.

    that come from other countries. We live in an age where many of us can do almost
    anything we want, more so than at any other time in history. But it turns out
    what we really want is for someone who knows what they’re doing to make it OK
    for us to follow our instincts. Hygge is a real thing and the Danish arguably
    do it best. But they do not have the monopoly on cosiness or candlelight. Fika
    is a beautiful tradition. But Sweden is not the only place in the world where
    you can eat cake and drink coffee. Similarly, you don’t need to be Dutch or know
    the word niksen to do nothing, you can just … do it. And there’s no way of doing
    nothing the wrong way. Completely predictably, I discovered that my definition
    of nothing is pannenkoeken (pancakes) after all.
