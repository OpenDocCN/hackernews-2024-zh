    continued to burn, this fire ended up spreading into the forest. In short, the
    main origin is the anthropic origin that we talk about, the origin is the man
    setting fire, whether in a pasture area, next door or directly in the forest to
    practice, to let it spread”, explains the spokesperson for Greenpeace.
