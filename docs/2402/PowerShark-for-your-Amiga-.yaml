    (very minor) changes to the electronics. Although these are relevant for only
    a handful of users, one design change will probably attract a lot of attention
    - a new color for the enclosure. We have just posted two polls to ask for your
    preferences. If you are on Twitter (X), please visit

- en: PowerShark is a next-generation power adapter for the Amiga line of computers
    - A500, A600 and A1200\. It provides stable, high quality power, perfect for continuous
    long-term operation of even the most expanded configurations. Utilizing any 12V-capable
    USB-C power supply for the first stage conversion, PowerShark allows users to
    tap into a vast array of affordable and readily available “power bricks” for their
    Amiga system. Furthermore, portable USB-C “chargers” are also supported, bringing
    the dream of battery-operated Amigas to life. And it works flawlessly with magnetic
    USB-C adapters, too, ensuring an accident-free environment similar to “MagSafe”.

- en: PowerShark continuously monitors the voltage supplied to your Amiga and immediately
    stops the current flow if even a slight deviation is detected. An extra voltage-sensing
    circuit ensures the Amiga components remain protected even if PowerShark fails.

- en: The protection circuit is designed for safe unattended operation. If an over-
    or under-voltage is detected for even a microsecond, or if your Amiga overloads
    PowerShark due to some internal failure, the device will cut the power and enter
    a locked-up state that requires a power cycle to reset. No more guessing whether
    an instability you experienced is due to a software bug or power issues!

- en: Speaking of power-cycling, doing it too rapidly can be a problem for old computers.
    That’s why PowerShark prevents it from happening by delaying successive power-up
    events by a few seconds.

- en: PowerShark leverages recent advances in integrated power circuits to achieve
    efficiency surpassing any Amiga power supply in existence (as measured at the
    mains outlet). When powered off, custom-designed circuits make it “greener” than
    virtually any other USB-C device on the planet - normally USB-C power supplies
    turn on and energize the connecting cable as soon a device is plugged on the other
    end. Not so with PowerShark, which remains “invisible” until you actually flip
    the power switch. In other words, you can keep it plugged at all times without
    worrying about your electricity bill.

- en: A glance at PowerShark, inside or outside, will immediately tell you that this
    is not your father’s power supply. The device sports an astonishingly compact
    form-factor, barely larger than the power plug you have been using so far, and
    a shape meticulously designed to ensure safety and ease of access. It’s lightweight,
    sturdy, and fits in a pocket (yes, that small one in front of your jeans). The
    circuit boards inside are a marvel of miniaturization, featuring many components
    barely visible to the naked eye. The entire device radiates polish and finesse.
    To hold it in your hand is to love it.
