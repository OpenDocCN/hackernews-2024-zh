    with DEF CON, leaving us with no venue for DC 32, and just about seven months
    to Con!

    change and it is not related to anything that DEF CON or our community has done.
    This kind of no-notice cancellation of a contract is unheard of in the conference
    business. The parting is confusing, but amicable.

    CON 32 before time runs out?

    event our size, and configurable enough to accommodate our content. We need a
    location close to our announced dates, and with super short notice... No small
    feat.

    Meetings were held. Hands were shook and options weighed. When the smoke cleared,
    the field narrowed to one obvious choice and we began forging the requisite agreements.

- en: DEF CON 32 will be an adventure where we can try things not possible in our
    old Casino Hotel spaces. What specifically you ask? Well we are still learning
    all the specifics but we will have more space, a proper food court, and the largest
    indoor venue LCD wall in the country.
