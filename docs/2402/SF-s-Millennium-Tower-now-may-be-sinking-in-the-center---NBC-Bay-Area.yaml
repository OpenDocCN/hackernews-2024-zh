- en: The engineer of the so-called fix of the troubled Millennium Tower in San Francisco
    recently acknowledged there’s been less than expected tilt improvement over the
    first six months of the $120 million project’s completion.

    much as four inches of tilt correction within six months after the leaning high-rise
    was anchored on two sides to bedrock.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: While the tower is no longer sinking anymore at the corner, and has reversed
    some settlement there, data shows there’s only been about an inch of tilt reversal,
    a quarter of what the model had predicted.

- en: Contractors in charge of the fix had made the more optimistic prediction under
    the theory that once supported on the north and west, the tower’s newly shifted
    weight would cause it to settle more on its east and south sides.

    sides, the tower appears to be sinking more in the center.

- en: “With all tall buildings, there is a tendency, even though the foundation mat
    may be quite thick, there is a tendency for this center to settle more than the
    edges,” says Harry Poulos, an internationally recognized expert on tall building
    foundations.

    at the center an overall rate of about a tenth of an inch a year.

    Poulos said, “and that would be a little bit of a concern to the longer term.”

    risk of relying on even sophisticated modeling to predict performance.

- en: Pyke said the concern about center sinking in buildings, also known as dishing,
    is that the deformation can trigger cracks underneath foundations. Such cracks,
    he said, carry the risk of long-term corrosion damage.
  id: totrans-split-16

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The concern is that should water seep in those cracks, it could rust exposed
    steel reinforcement. Rusted steel expands and that can trigger more damage to
    the cracked concrete.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “It’s highly likely that there's been an increase in cracking for this kind
    of fix,” Pyke said. “That should have been obvious that there was a possibility
    of further increasing cracking and water intrusion into the foundation.”
  id: totrans-split-18

    of the underside of the foundation to reveal and repair cracks.

- en: As for what might explain the building’s unpredicted behavior, Pyke points to
    a buried wall under the east side of the tower’s foundation as a likely factor.
  id: totrans-split-20

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Pyke says that wall, built to separate the Millennium Tower from a neighboring
    underground garage, could be preventing the tower from tilting back the predicted
    four inches to the east.

- en: Fix engineers said the model predicted the dividing wall would sink under the
    new weight imposed by the tower settling in the opposite direction. But a skeptical
    Pyke says the monitoring data so far suggests the massive underground wall is
    holding fast.

- en: The designer of the fix project, Ron Hamburger, told us in a statement that
    the northwest corner is now stable and cannot sink more. That has resulted in
    a quarter of an inch of improvement in the settlement at the northwest corner.

    not at the rate the model predicted because of unexpected soil response.

- en: The “remainder of the building continues to settle as we always anticipated,
    resulting in tilt recovery, albeit it at [a] slightly lower rate,” than modeling
    predicted, Hamburger said. “We believe this lower rate of settlement is because
    stress relief of the soils under the building has been more effective than originally
    forecast.”

    the fix was completed. Its currently tilting a little less than 29 inches at the
    northwest corner.

    to stop it from sinking and leaning. While the project was hailed as an immediate
    success, the high-rise now appears to be sinking in the middle. Raj Mathai speaks
    with Jaxon Van Derbeken on this.
