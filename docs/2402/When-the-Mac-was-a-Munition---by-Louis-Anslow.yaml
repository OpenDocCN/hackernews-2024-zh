    not aesthetically - like the iMac before it - but mathematically: it surpassed
    1 *GIGAFLOP* of computing power.'

    and potential weapon of war, and so was subject to strict export controls. The
    cold war era *1979 Export Administration Act* that set the precedent for these
    rules, was written to prevent powerful computers falling into communist hands.

    we carry around *thousands* of GIGAFLOPs in our pockets: the iPhone 15 Pro has
    2000 GIGAFLOPs, while iPhone 12 has 1000\.'

    was used in its marketing, it dubbed the G4 a ‘*Personal Supercomputer*’ and ran
    a TV ad featuring tanks surrounding the device.Steve Jobs would say at its unveiling
    that they got the idea after being informed of the restrictions by the US Government
    government officials.

    companies rapidly approach crippling export restrictions on products. (This mimicking
    a [similar](https://www.newspapers.com/article/the-news-tribune/133809906/) parallel
    battle about encryption at the time.) And they succeeded. The truth was, the GIGAFLOP
    threshold had been increased by President Clinton in prior months - but was not
    set to go into effect until January 2000 - until then Apple had export restrictions,
    but did have a headline grabbing marketing gimmick.

    as calls to regulate AI and once again treat the computing power used to train
    them as munitions, grows louder.

    was in a consumer product - but restricted by an outdated law. Now, Apple's M3
    Mac - boasting 4000 GIGAFLOPs - is exported globally.

    reporting AI trained on hardware exceeding “1e26 floating point operations or
    1e23 integer operations.” Perhaps we’ll look back in 50 years and laugh how we
    treated once impressive levels of computing power as threatening.
