- en: When 2,529 people were offered a free subscription to their local newspapers,
    the *Pittsburgh Post-Gazette* and the *Philadelphia Inquirer*, only forty-four
    accepted—less than 2 percent—according to an academic study set to be published
    this year in the *American Journal of Political Science*.

    conducted the study, titled “[Unsubscribed and Undemanding](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4502329),”
    in 2021\. The purpose of the research, Hopkins said, was to assess practical ways
    to increase interest in local or regional news for an audience that seems more
    interested in national, partisan media outlets. (The pool of those offered subscriptions
    was made up of locals who had previously responded to political surveys.) Hopkins
    said that he was “surprised and dismayed” when he realized that only 1.7 percent
    had accepted the free subscription.

- en: The findings add context to what has been a difficult start to 2024 for American
    media. There have been hundreds of layoffs across the industry—the *Washington
    Post*, *Wall Street Journal*, *Los Angeles Times, Sports Illustrated*, and *Business
    Insider,* among others, have all downsized. At the local level, half the counties
    in America have either one news outlet or none at all, according to Medill’s 2023
    [State of Local News Project](https://localnewsinitiative.northwestern.edu/projects/state-of-local-news/2023/).
    Of those counties, over two hundred are “news deserts,” without any local media
    whatsoever.

- en: Hopkins conceived the study after writing a book in 2018 on the nationalization
    of American politics. In *The Increasingly United States* he argues that declining
    interest and access to local news forces voters, who are not otherwise familiar
    with the specifics of their local governments’ agendas or legislators, to default
    to national partisan lines when casting regional ballots. As a result, politicians
    are not held accountable, voters are not aware of the issues, and the candidates
    who get elected reflect national ideologies rather than representing local needs.

- en: Hopkins and his coauthor Tori Gorton sent the free-subscription offers on postcards
    in the mail and targeted social media messages over the spring and summer of 2021\.
    They ran a parallel study in which they determined the level of engagement with
    free local news stories (mostly about COVID) on social media. Some of the responses
    made clear that there were strong feelings at play.

    “[t]he P-G is an awful newspaper run by horrible bigoted people.” Other comments
    collected from the social platforms read: “no thanks! Fake News” and “GOTTA BE
    BAD FOR THE MEDIA WHEN YOU CAN’T GIVE THE CRAP AWAY.”'

- en: Neither paper has yet covered the study in its own pages. The *Post-Gazette*
    did not respond to requests for comment. Evan Benn, the senior director of special
    projects at the *Inquirer*, told CJR that the study was a welcome chance to gain
    insight into potential subscribers looking for local news, especially given that
    a grant from the University of Pennsylvania covered the cost of the subscriptions.
    He declined to respond on the record to the substance of the findings.

    researcher,” he said, “to study why things have changed than how to push in the
    opposite direction.”
