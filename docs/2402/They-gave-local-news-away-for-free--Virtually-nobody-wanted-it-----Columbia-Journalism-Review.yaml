- en: When 2,529 people were offered a free subscription to their local newspapers,
    the *Pittsburgh Post-Gazette* and the *Philadelphia Inquirer*, only forty-four
    accepted—less than 2 percent—according to an academic study set to be published
    this year in the *American Journal of Political Science*.

  zh: 当 2,529 人被提供免费订阅他们的当地报纸《匹兹堡邮报》和《费城询问报》时，只有 44 人接受了，不到 2%。这是根据一项学术研究，预计将于今年发表在《美国政治科学杂志》上。
- en: Dan Hopkins, a political science professor at the University of Pennsylvania,
    conducted the study, titled “[Unsubscribed and Undemanding](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4502329),”
    in 2021\. The purpose of the research, Hopkins said, was to assess practical ways
    to increase interest in local or regional news for an audience that seems more
    interested in national, partisan media outlets. (The pool of those offered subscriptions
    was made up of locals who had previously responded to political surveys.) Hopkins
    said that he was “surprised and dismayed” when he realized that only 1.7 percent
    had accepted the free subscription.

  zh: 费城宾夕法尼亚大学的政治科学教授 Dan Hopkins 在 2021 年进行了名为《[Unsubscribed and Undemanding](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4502329)》的研究。Hopkins
    表示，研究的目的是评估增加对本地或区域新闻兴趣的实际方法，针对那些似乎更倾向于国家级、党派性媒体的受众。（被提供订阅的对象是之前参与政治调查的当地人。）当他意识到只有
    1.7% 的人接受了免费订阅时，他表示“感到惊讶和沮丧”。
- en: The findings add context to what has been a difficult start to 2024 for American
    media. There have been hundreds of layoffs across the industry—the *Washington
    Post*, *Wall Street Journal*, *Los Angeles Times, Sports Illustrated*, and *Business
    Insider,* among others, have all downsized. At the local level, half the counties
    in America have either one news outlet or none at all, according to Medill’s 2023
    [State of Local News Project](https://localnewsinitiative.northwestern.edu/projects/state-of-local-news/2023/).
    Of those counties, over two hundred are “news deserts,” without any local media
    whatsoever.

  zh: 这些发现为美国媒体在 2024 年的艰难开局增添了背景。整个行业遭遇了数百人的裁员 - 《华盛顿邮报》、《华尔街日报》、《洛杉矶时报》、《体育画报》和《商业内幕》等都在缩减规模。根据梅迪尔
    2023 年的《州级本地新闻项目》报告，在地方层面，美国有一半的县只有一个或没有新闻机构。在这些县中，超过两百个是“新闻沙漠”，根本没有本地媒体存在。
- en: Hopkins conceived the study after writing a book in 2018 on the nationalization
    of American politics. In *The Increasingly United States* he argues that declining
    interest and access to local news forces voters, who are not otherwise familiar
    with the specifics of their local governments’ agendas or legislators, to default
    to national partisan lines when casting regional ballots. As a result, politicians
    are not held accountable, voters are not aware of the issues, and the candidates
    who get elected reflect national ideologies rather than representing local needs.

  zh: Hopkins 在 2018 年写了一本关于美国政治国家化的书后构思了这项研究。在《The Increasingly United States》中，他认为，对本地新闻兴趣的下降和获取渠道的减少迫使选民在投票时，如果他们对本地政府议程或立法者的具体情况不熟悉，就会默认选择国家党派路线。结果是，政客不受约束，选民不了解问题，当选的候选人反映的是国家意识形态，而不是代表本地需求。
- en: Hopkins and his coauthor Tori Gorton sent the free-subscription offers on postcards
    in the mail and targeted social media messages over the spring and summer of 2021\.
    They ran a parallel study in which they determined the level of engagement with
    free local news stories (mostly about COVID) on social media. Some of the responses
    made clear that there were strong feelings at play.

  zh: Hopkins 和他的合著者 Tori Gorton 在 2021 年春夏之际，通过明信片和社交媒体定向消息免费订阅报纸。他们进行了一项平行研究，评估社交媒体上对免费本地新闻故事（主要是关于
    COVID 的新闻）的参与程度。一些回应表明，情感因素起到了重要作用。
- en: 'One returned an invitation to subscribe to the *Post-Gazette* with a message:
    “[t]he P-G is an awful newspaper run by horrible bigoted people.” Other comments
    collected from the social platforms read: “no thanks! Fake News” and “GOTTA BE
    BAD FOR THE MEDIA WHEN YOU CAN’T GIVE THE CRAP AWAY.”'

    did not respond to requests for comment. Evan Benn, the senior director of special
    projects at the *Inquirer*, told CJR that the study was a welcome chance to gain
    insight into potential subscribers looking for local news, especially given that
    a grant from the University of Pennsylvania covered the cost of the subscriptions.
    He declined to respond on the record to the substance of the findings.
