- en: Within a one-mile radius in Cambridge, Massachusetts, sit Harvard University
    and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology — academic institutions that together
    boast $74 billion in endowment funds. Based on the size of these “rainy-day funds”
    alone, the two universities, with a combined student body of 37,000, have enough
    wealth to [rival Ghana](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.CD?most_recent_value_desc=true&year_high_desc=true),
    with a population of 35 million.

    taxes.

    a groundbreaking bill that would impose a 2.5 percent annual excise tax on private
    college and university endowments that are larger than $1 billion. The resulting
    $2.5 billion raised each year would be more than enough to cover the tuition of
    every undergraduate student currently attending public colleges and universities
    in the state.
