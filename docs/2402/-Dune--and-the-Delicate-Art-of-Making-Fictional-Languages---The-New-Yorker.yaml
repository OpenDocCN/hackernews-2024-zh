  zh: 丹尼斯·维伦纽夫的电影《[沙丘：第二部](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2024/03/11/dune-part-two-movie-review)》的预告片中，由蒂莫西·柴勒梅德扮演的少年预言家保罗·亚特雷德斯对着一群沙漠人大喊着一些外语和无法解释的话语。我们看到柴勒梅德是充满魅力和怒火的化身：每一根面部肌肉都绷紧，他的声音紧张而嘶哑，有指挥的力量。屏幕底部的一行字幕翻译为：“战士们万岁！”

    his first excursion into the “Dune” universe such [an experiential feast](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/the-enduring-appeal-of-dune-as-an-adolescent-power-fantasy)
    was its vivid, immersive quality, combining monumental architectural design with
    atmospheric soundscapes and ethereal costuming. We could see a few remnants of
    our world (remember the bit with the bagpipes?), but the over-all effect was transportive,
    as if the camera were not a piece of equipment but a cyborgian eye live-streaming
    from a far-flung alien civilization. Chalamet’s strange tongue is part of the
    franchise’s meticulous set dressing. It’s not gibberish, but part of an intricate
    linguistic system that was devised for Villeneuve’s adaptations.

  zh: 这一场景在三分钟的预告片中几乎只有几秒钟，但确立了电影的情感基调，并捕捉到了推动剧情的救世主热情。它也标志着维伦纽夫所创造的世界深度。他首次涉足“沙丘”宇宙之旅的一部分是其生动、引人入胜的特质，将宏伟的建筑设计与大气的音景和飘逸的服装相结合。我们可以看到一些与我们的世界有关的痕迹（还记得风笛吗？），但整体效果是具有传送性的，好像摄像机不是一件设备，而是一只从遥远外星文明实时直播的仿生眼睛。柴勒梅德的古怪语言是该系列精心设计的一部分。它不是胡言乱语，而是维伦纽夫改编所设计的一套复杂的语言体系的组成部分。

    in imaginative fiction. Twenty years ago, viewers would have struggled to name
    franchises other than “Star Trek” or “The Lord of the Rings” that bothered to
    invent new languages. Today, with the budgets of the biggest films and series
    rivalling the G.D.P.s of small island nations, constructed languages, or conlangs,
    are becoming a norm, if not an implicit requirement. Breeze through entertainment
    from the past decade or so, and you’ll find lingos designed for Paleolithic peoples
    (“Alpha”), spell-casting witches (“Penny Dreadful”), post-apocalyptic survivors
    (“Into the Badlands”), Superman’s home planet of Krypton (“[Man of Steel](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/richard-brody/superman-and-the-superego)”),

  zh: 柴勒梅德所说的这种经过构思的语言代表了想象小说的一个新标杆。20年前，观众可能都很难想起除了“星际迷航”或“指环王”之外还有哪些系列作品会费心去创造新语言。如今，拥有最大制作预算的影视作品与一些小岛国家的国内生产总值相当，构造语言或者合成语言(conlangs)
    已经成为了一种规范，甚至是一种隐含的要求。回顾过去十年左右的娱乐作品，你会发现为旧石器时代的人类设计的语言（《阿尔法》）、施法的女巫们的语言（《惊悚传奇》）、末日幸存者的语言（《末日之地》）、超人的故乡克利比斯的语言（《[钢铁之躯](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/richard-brody/superman-and-the-superego)》）、跨种族的外星联盟的语言（《光晕》）、穿越时空的少年们的语言（《纸片女孩》）、奥兹国的Munja’kin部落的语言（《绿野仙踪》）以及圣诞老人和他的精灵的语言（《圣诞故事》及其续集）等等，都是特意构造出来的。

  zh: 一种精心设计的构造语言可以增强电影的真实感。它可以加深景观吸引力，长期以来，这一直是科幻和奇幻等虚构类型创作者和粉丝的痴迷所在。但娱乐业对打造超真实的领域的着迷也可能分散注意力。虚构小说通过将熟悉的事物与无法识别的事物相融合来进行推理。不是通过创造尽可能真实的外星世界，而是通过将其与我们自己的世界交织在一起来进行尖锐的挑衅。
- en: Hollywood’s current obsession with constructed languages arguably started with
    “The Lord of the Rings” film adaptations of the early two-thousands. J. R. R.
    Tolkien was a professor of Old English at Oxford and a lifelong conlanger, and
    he famously created the tongues of Middle-earth long before writing the books.
    “The invention of languages is the foundation,” he once wrote. “The ‘stories’
    were made rather to provide a world for the languages than the reverse.” The trilogy’s
    success showed the power of conlangs to create engrossing alternate realities,
    inspiring filmmakers to seek out skilled language creators.

    这一三部曲的成功展示了构造语言的力量，启发了电影制作人寻求技艺精湛的语言创造者。
- en: 'The most influential conlanger working today is David J. Peterson. Born in
    Long Beach, California, Peterson started to create languages in 2000, while he
    was a sophomore at U.C. Berkeley. His early projects were amusing experiments:
    X, a language that could only be written; Sheli, which included only sounds that
    he liked and was initially unpronounceable; and Zhyler, which he created because
    he enjoyed Turkish and which, in honor of the Heinz Company, had fifty-seven noun
    cases. In 2005, he graduated with a master’s degree in linguistics from U.C. San
    Diego. Two years later, he co-founded the Language Creation Society with nine

    would emerge as Dothraki). Nothing like this had ever happened before, so the

    When creating High Valyrian, Peterson was forced to include words that George
    R. R. Martin had composed for the books, including *dracarys*, meaning “dragon
    fire.” The word was obviously inspired by the Latin *draco*, meaning “dragon,”
    a decision that Peterson found “unfortunate.” “In the universe of the books, there
    is no such thing as the Latin language—or any of the other languages on Earth,”
    he once wrote. “It is literally impossible for any word (or anything else) in
    the *Song of Ice and Fire* universe to be related to anything in our universe.”
    As a result, he made *dracarys* its own root and chose *zaldrīzes* as the word
    for “dragon,” provoking a string of disappointed comments from “Game of Thrones”
    fans on his blog.

- en: As Peterson laid out in his 2015 book, “[The Art of Language Invention](https://www.amazon.com/Art-Language-Invention-Horse-Lords-World-Building/dp/0143126466),”
    he treats languages as evolving systems whose features are interconnected and
    shaped by a unique history. To design verbs in High Valyrian, for example, he
    simulated a four-stage evolution from a prehistoric form. In the version of High
    Valyrian spoken in “Game of Thrones,” verbs have an imperfect stem (for past actions
    that were continuous or incomplete) and a perfect stem (for past actions that
    were completed). The perfect stem, he decided, was formed in ancient times by
    appending *-tat­* to the end of the imperfect. Over time, this became *-tet* and
    then *-et*, which often reduces to *-t* in the version spoken in the television
    show. (During that imagined history, *-tat* also gave rise to the verb *tatagon*,
    meaning “to finish.”) There are countless other intricacies to High Valyrian verbs,
    yet, for Peterson, even producing this lone grammatical feature required simulating
    generations of linguistic change.

    had honed for previous projects. “In the case of both *Dune* and *Game of Thrones*,”
    he wrote during an Ask Me Anything on Reddit before Part One’s release, “there
    was some minimal language elements from the books that I had to account for, but
    other than that it was up to me to create something brand new.” He had decided,
    in other words, to develop what conlangers call an a-priori language—one whose
