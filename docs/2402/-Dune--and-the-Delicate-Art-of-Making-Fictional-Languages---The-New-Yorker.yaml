    features the boy prophet Paul Atreides, played by Timothée Chalamet, yelling something
    foreign and uninterpretable to a horde of desert people. We see Chalamet as the
    embodiment of charismatic fury: every facial muscle clenched in tension, his voice
    strained and throaty and commanding. A line at the bottom of the screen translates:
    “Long live the fighters!”'

- en: The scene fills barely a few seconds in a three-minute trailer, yet it establishes
    the emotional tone of the film and captures the messianic fervor that drives its
    plot. It also signals the depth of Villeneuve’s world-building. Part of what made
    his first excursion into the “Dune” universe such [an experiential feast](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/the-enduring-appeal-of-dune-as-an-adolescent-power-fantasy)
    was its vivid, immersive quality, combining monumental architectural design with
    atmospheric soundscapes and ethereal costuming. We could see a few remnants of
    our world (remember the bit with the bagpipes?), but the over-all effect was transportive,
    as if the camera were not a piece of equipment but a cyborgian eye live-streaming
    from a far-flung alien civilization. Chalamet’s strange tongue is part of the
    franchise’s meticulous set dressing. It’s not gibberish, but part of an intricate
    linguistic system that was devised for Villeneuve’s adaptations.

- en: Engineered languages such as the one Chalamet speaks represent a new benchmark
    in imaginative fiction. Twenty years ago, viewers would have struggled to name
    franchises other than “Star Trek” or “The Lord of the Rings” that bothered to
    invent new languages. Today, with the budgets of the biggest films and series
    rivalling the G.D.P.s of small island nations, constructed languages, or conlangs,
    are becoming a norm, if not an implicit requirement. Breeze through entertainment
    from the past decade or so, and you’ll find lingos designed for Paleolithic peoples
    (“Alpha”), spell-casting witches (“Penny Dreadful”), post-apocalyptic survivors
    (“Into the Badlands”), Superman’s home planet of Krypton (“[Man of Steel](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/richard-brody/superman-and-the-superego)”),
    a cross-species alien alliance (“Halo”), time-travelling preteens (“Paper Girls”),
    the Munja’kin tribe of Oz (“Emerald City”), and Santa Claus and his elves (“The
    Christmas Chronicles” and its sequel).

- en: A well-executed conlang can bolster a film’s appearance of authenticity. It
    can deepen the scenic absorption that has long been an obsession for creators
    and fans of speculative genres such as science fiction and fantasy. But the entertainment
    industry’s fixation with crafting super-realistic realms can also be distracting.
    Speculative fiction works by melding the familiar with the unrecognizable. It
    makes trenchant provocations not by creating the most believably alien worlds
    possible but by interweaving them with strands from our own.

- en: Hollywood’s current obsession with constructed languages arguably started with
    “The Lord of the Rings” film adaptations of the early two-thousands. J. R. R.
    Tolkien was a professor of Old English at Oxford and a lifelong conlanger, and
    he famously created the tongues of Middle-earth long before writing the books.
    “The invention of languages is the foundation,” he once wrote. “The ‘stories’
    were made rather to provide a world for the languages than the reverse.” The trilogy’s
    success showed the power of conlangs to create engrossing alternate realities,
    inspiring filmmakers to seek out skilled language creators.

    Long Beach, California, Peterson started to create languages in 2000, while he
    was a sophomore at U.C. Berkeley. His early projects were amusing experiments:
    X, a language that could only be written; Sheli, which included only sounds that
    he liked and was initially unpronounceable; and Zhyler, which he created because
    he enjoyed Turkish and which, in honor of the Heinz Company, had fifty-seven noun
    cases. In 2005, he graduated with a master’s degree in linguistics from U.C. San
    Diego. Two years later, he co-founded the Language Creation Society with nine
    other conlangers.'

    Society with a strange request. They were creating a television show (which would
    turn out to be “Game of Thrones”) and wanted someone to develop a language (which
    would emerge as Dothraki). Nothing like this had ever happened before, so the
    society organized a competition that would be judged by the show’s producers.
    After signing a nondisclosure agreement, applicants were invited to send in a
    phonetic breakdown of Dothraki, a romanized transcription system, six to eight
    lines of translated text, and any additional notes or translations.

    weeks, he worked eighteen-hour days, assembling a hundred and eighty pages of
    material. He made it to the second round and eventually produced more than three
    hundred pages in Dothraki. He landed the job and was later invited to develop
    five more languages for the series, including High Valyrian, which proved especially
    popular among fans. In 2017, a High Valyrian course launched on the language-learning
    app [Duolingo](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/04/24/how-much-can-duolingo-teach-us);
    at one point in 2023, more than nine hundred thousand people had signed up as

    (2009), which appeared in theatres soon after Peterson was hired by HBO, the first
    season of “Game of Thrones” demonstrated that audiences not only tolerated fictional
    languages—they loved them. What had previously been a nerdy pastime transformed
    into a standard of fantasy filmmaking. Peterson became the go-to language wizard.
    He has since been hired to create some fifty other conlangs, including languages
    for the Dark Elves in “Thor: The Dark World” (2013), for the Grounders in the
    television show “The 100” (2014-20), and for the desert-dwelling Fremen in the
    two “Dune” movies. When Chalamet, as Paul Atreides, calls to his combatants, he
    does so in words devised by Peterson and his wife and fellow-conlanger, Jessie.

- en: Peterson’s success stems from a commitment to naturalism. He knows languages
    well; he has studied more than twenty, including Swahili, Middle Egyptian, and
    Esperanto, and seems to have an endless mental Rolodex of the lexical, grammatical,
    and phonological patterns found around the world. Yet, when an interviewer asked
    him how, when assembling a new conlang, he decides “which aspects of a language
    to borrow from and mimic” (Greek suffixes? Mongolian tenses? Japanese particles?),
    he rejected the premise. “If you just ripped out a structure from one language
    and put it in your own, the result would be inauthentic,” he replied.

- en: Peterson’s idea of authenticity sometimes puts him at odds with his source texts.
    When creating High Valyrian, Peterson was forced to include words that George
    R. R. Martin had composed for the books, including *dracarys*, meaning “dragon
    fire.” The word was obviously inspired by the Latin *draco*, meaning “dragon,”
    a decision that Peterson found “unfortunate.” “In the universe of the books, there
    is no such thing as the Latin language—or any of the other languages on Earth,”
    he once wrote. “It is literally impossible for any word (or anything else) in
    the *Song of Ice and Fire* universe to be related to anything in our universe.”
    As a result, he made *dracarys* its own root and chose *zaldrīzes* as the word
    for “dragon,” provoking a string of disappointed comments from “Game of Thrones”
    fans on his blog.

- en: As Peterson laid out in his 2015 book, “[The Art of Language Invention](https://www.amazon.com/Art-Language-Invention-Horse-Lords-World-Building/dp/0143126466),”
    he treats languages as evolving systems whose features are interconnected and
    shaped by a unique history. To design verbs in High Valyrian, for example, he
    simulated a four-stage evolution from a prehistoric form. In the version of High
    Valyrian spoken in “Game of Thrones,” verbs have an imperfect stem (for past actions
    that were continuous or incomplete) and a perfect stem (for past actions that
    were completed). The perfect stem, he decided, was formed in ancient times by
    appending *-tat­* to the end of the imperfect. Over time, this became *-tet* and
    then *-et*, which often reduces to *-t* in the version spoken in the television
    show. (During that imagined history, *-tat* also gave rise to the verb *tatagon*,
    meaning “to finish.”) There are countless other intricacies to High Valyrian verbs,
    yet, for Peterson, even producing this lone grammatical feature required simulating
    generations of linguistic change.

- en: When he was invited to work on “Dune,” Peterson fell back on the methods he
    had honed for previous projects. “In the case of both *Dune* and *Game of Thrones*,”
    he wrote during an Ask Me Anything on Reddit before Part One’s release, “there
    was some minimal language elements from the books that I had to account for, but
    other than that it was up to me to create something brand new.” He had decided,
    in other words, to develop what conlangers call an a-priori language—one whose
    vocabulary and grammar are wholly original, and not derived from an existing linguistic
    system.

    will surely inform you, language functions differently in “[Dune](https://www.amazon.com/Dune-Frank-Herbert/dp/0441172717).”
    Written by Frank Herbert, and originally published in 1965, the novel recounts
    how noble houses compete to control the desert planet Arrakis (the eponymous Dune),
    the only source of the most precious substance in the universe. The story entwines
    the fate of the aristocratic Paul Atreides with the indigenous Fremen, whose harsh
    desert life style and religious prophecies set the scene for ecological challenges
    and epic political face-offs.

    takes place unimaginably far in the future. The time span separating us from the
    events of “Dune” is roughly twice the distance between us and the end of the Ice
    Age; sabre-toothed tigers are closer to us than the plot of “Dune” is. Nevertheless,
    it’s a world suffused with familiar echoes, most of which manifest in language.
    The novel features words derived from French (“*verite*”), Turkish (“*kanly*”),
    Hebrew (“*Kwisatz Haderach*”), German (“*schlag*”), and Navajo (“*Nezhoni*”).
    Having been raised in a Sikh household, I remember noticing the emperor’s title,
    *Padishah*, a Persian term that has been used as an honorific for rulers in North
    Africa, the Middle East, and South Asia. Sikhs use it to refer to God and the
    ten prophet leaders, or gurus.'
