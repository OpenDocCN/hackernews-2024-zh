    to add KOSA to must-pass legislation, like the FAA. This bill would be a threat
    to free speech online and puts LGBTQ+ kids at further risk, in an already scary
    time for them. If you care about kids' experience online, Congress should pass
    comprehensive data privacy legislation that actually protects children, instead
    of harming them. ”

- en: KOSA uses two methods to “protect” kids, and both of them are awful.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'First, KOSA would allow the government to pressure social media platforms to
    erase content that could be deemed “inappropriate” for minors. **The problem is:
    there is no consensus on what is inappropriate for minors.** All across the country
    we are seeing how lawmakers are attacking young people’s access to gender affirming
    healthcare, sex education, birth control, and abortion. Online communities and
    resources that queer and trans youth depend on as lifelines should not be subject
    to the whims of the most rightwing extremist powers and we shouldn’t give them
    another tool to harm marginalized communities.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Second, KOSA would ramp up the online surveillance of all internet users by
    expanding the use of age verification and parental monitoring tools. Not only
    are these tools needlessly invasive, they’re a massive safety risk for young people
    who could be trying to escape domestic violence and abuse.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Dozens of LGBTQ+ and civil rights groups agree that KOSA is dangerous and updates
    to the bill haven’t addressed the core concerns advocates have about its impact
    on already often censored content and resources.  **If you believe in a free and
    open internet, send a message to your lawmakers right now and tell them to reject
    KOSA!**

- en: '**I’ve heard there’s a new version of KOSA. What’s the deal?**'
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'The new version of KOSA makes some good changes: narrowing the ability of rightwing
    attorneys general to weaponize KOSA to target content they don’t like and limiting
    the problematic “duty of care.” However, because the bill is still not content
    neutral, KOSA still invites the harms that civil rights advocates have warned
    about.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As LGBTQ and reproductive rights groups have said for months, the fundamental
    problem with KOSA is that its “duty of care” covers content specific aspects of
    content recommendation systems, and the new changes fail to address that. In fact,
    personalized recommendation systems are explicitly listed under the definition
    of a design feature covered by the duty of care in the new version. This means
    that a future Federal Trade Commission (FTC) could still use KOSA to pressure
    platforms into automated filtering of important, but controversial topics like
    LGBTQ issues and abortion, by claiming that algorithmically recommending such
    content “causes” mental health outcomes that are covered by the duty of care like
    anxiety and depression. **Bans on inclusive books, abortion, and gender affirming
    healthcare have been passed on exactly that kind of rhetoric in many states recently.**
    And we know that already existing content filtering systems impact content from
    marginalized creators exponentially more, resulting in discrimination and censorship.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'It’s also important to remember that algorithmic recommendation includes, for
    example, showing a user a post from a friend that they follow, since most platforms
    do not show all users all posts, but curate them in some way. As long as KOSA’s
    duty of care isn’t content neutral, platforms will be likely to react the same
    way that they did to the broad liability imposed by SESTA/FOSTA: by engaging in
    aggressive filtering and suppression of important, and in some cases lifesaving,
    content.'

    damage in the fight to keep kids safe online. We have to keep up the pressure
    until this legislation is amended to ensure it will protect all kids, rather than
    endangering some of the most vulnerable.**'
