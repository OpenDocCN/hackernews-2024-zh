- en: Polyinstantiation is a security mechanism used in database management systems
    (DBMS) to prevent information inference attacks. It involves the creation of multiple
    instances of an object with different levels of sensitivity or security, allowing
    users with different access levels to access the same object while seeing only
    the information they are authorized to view.

- en: 'Weak Polyinstantiation: In weak polyinstantiation, multiple instances of an
    object are created with different sensitivity levels. Each instance contains a
    subset of the information available in the higher-level instance. This approach
    ensures that users with lower security clearances cannot infer information from
    higher-level instances.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'Strong Polyinstantiation: Strong polyinstantiation takes the concept further
    by allowing different instances of an object to have different values for the
    same attribute. This means that an attribute''s value in one instance may not
    match its value in another instance. Strong polyinstantiation aims to protect
    against covert channels, where unauthorized users could potentially infer information
    by analyzing the values of shared attributes.'

- en: In this example, User A can access the complete salary information, while User
    B can only see salaries up to $80,000\. By employing polyinstantiation, the DBMS
    ensures that User B cannot infer the actual salary of any employee beyond the
    threshold they are authorized to view.

    information and prevent unauthorized users from deducing confidential data by
    limiting the information available to them based on their security clearances.
