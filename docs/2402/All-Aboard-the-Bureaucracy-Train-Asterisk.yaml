    If it was in Brooklyn or in Queens, it didn’t matter very much. But in Manhattan

  zh: 美国需要开始明白，你们比你们鄙视的国家要落后。土耳其是最大的例子，甚至不及意大利。向正确的地方学习。这并不是说美国没有公务员，好吗？这不是乌干达。有很多人，比如说，和我差不多年龄的人，有非常好的想法。只是他们没有被倾听。停止试图对抗公务员。雇佣那些不是全才或政治任命的人。如果需要雇佣一个外来者，就雇佣一个外来者。
- en: And over time, I think it would succeed and create a tradition where you have
    to hire someone who’s a professional because all the successes will come from
    that. Byford is considered to have been a success in New York, and he became a
    superstar as a result. But if there are many like him in various parts of the
    United States, people will notice.

  zh: 随着时间的推移，我认为它会取得成功，并创造一种传统，你必须雇佣一个专业人士，因为所有的成功都将来自于此。拜福德被认为在纽约取得了成功，并因此成为了超级巨星。但是如果在美国的各个地方有很多像他这样的人，人们会注意到。
