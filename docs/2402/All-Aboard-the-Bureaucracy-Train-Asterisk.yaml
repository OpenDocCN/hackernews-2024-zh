    Why is America so bad at building transit systems? Earlier this year, your team
    at NYU released a massive report comparing transit costs in Istanbul, Italy, Sweden
    and Boston, and then, of course, New York. It culminates in your fantastic case

    interests, which at the time included private streetcar companies. Hylan was hostile
    to the private operators. This led to bustitution — using buses to undercut the
    streetcar companies, though even then it was clear that the buses were providing
    inferior service that cost more to provide.

    So the city started building something called the Independent Subway System, commonly
    known as IND (because the private companies were called IRT, Interborough Rapid
    Transit). It was built by the city with the express purpose of driving the privates
    out of business — so the lines were kind of duplicative of the older lines. Only
    in two places did they truly expand into new places that were not served before.
    One is the G train, the Crosstown Line between Long Island City and downtown Brooklyn.
    The other is the Queens Boulevard line.

    cover them up. With deep boring you use a tunnel boring machine. The tunneling
    machine goes horizontally, and you don’t disturb the surface except to build stations,
    which are usually still cut and cover. The merchants will hate you, but after
    a couple of years of this, they get a station. You can even build the stations
    from underground, but it’s about 50% more expensive. Generally, cut and cover
    is superior to deep boring because the stations are closer to the surface, so
    passengers have less time to travel down to them. It’s also cheaper because you
    don’t remove as much earth and the stations are easier to build. It does create
    more surface disturbance. But if you can get away with cut and covering everything,
    you should cut and cover everything.'

    standards were wider curves, curves that were, in most cases, wider than the turn
    radius of the streets themselves. And because of that, something had to give.
    If it was in Brooklyn or in Queens, it didn’t matter very much. But in Manhattan
    they had to shave corners off of buildings, which meant demolishing buildings
    in midtown. This made everything much more expensive, and it meant they could
    not do cut and cover in a way that was cost effective.'
  prefs: []

    to deep boring was made — not just the tunnels, which is pretty standard globally,
    but also the stations at 72nd and 86th Street, which is not standard. This is
    an example of how you start doing something right, but it’s compromised in a way
    that makes everything collapse. And as a result, instead of fixing the one bad
    thing, you replace the paradigm.

    is cheaper. But if you’re, let’s say, Italy, and you have very low construction

    disturbance scales with income or population density.

    the state does planning. They can contract consultants to help, but the state
    supervises them. The state owns the design. You almost always do two contracts,
    one for design and one for construction. It’s called, in American terminology,
    “Design-Bid-Build.”

    you need a large in-house bureaucracy. You can just pretend Design-Build works
    if you don’t have one, because the consultants will do everything. And then when
    they submit a large bill, they say, “Oh, it’s just hard to build here. It’s because

    So instead of saying it’s $150, you say it’s $200 so that when the cost inevitably
    rises, you can say you went below budget. And this has been pretty deleterious

    is people being too rigid because they passed these laws in the 1900s and 1910s
    and didn’t update them correctly. Instead of, say, letting construction contractors
    make changes, they always keep the risk in the public sector. The thinking is
    that if the risk is privatized, the private concessionaire will just raise the

    Again, you can outsource the design to consultants, but the consultants need to
    be supervised by civil servants, not political appointees and not other consultants.
    The most complex and the most sensitive projects are the ones that require the
    most public supervision, not the least. Another place we see this issue in the
    U.S. is with which contractor to pick. In the United States there is a legal framework
    for what’s called lowest responsible bid, which means the civil service is required
    to pick the lowest bid. Usually they can reject a bid if it’s unrealistic. But,
    for example, in California, they can’t even do that.

    technically for how good it looks to them, and then hire based on a combination
    of the technical score and the price. In California, they erred by having too
    little weight on the technical score, only 30%. The norm in the European low-
    and medium-cost countries that we have seen is that the technical score ranges
    from 50 to 70%. But this means you need to have an in-house bureaucracy that can
    technically score things. Another thing low-cost countries do is publicly itemize
    costs so that whenever you have disputes over changes, they’re prepriced. If someone
    says, say, “We’ve had a six month delay, and the prices of the concrete walls
    are higher than we expect because the prices of concrete have risen,” it’s priced
    in. It means that you want to constantly deprivatize risk as much as possible,
    because the state can bear the risk much more than a private contractor.

    state. At this point in the United States, it often happens to the parallel party
    governance. So Beto O’Rourke in the 2018 Senate race went to, I forget which college,
    maybe UT Austin, but a very left-leaning electorate to try to get out the vote.
    And he said the consultants would never let us go to a college. We go here because
    we didn’t hire any. Now, Beto, like every other American political candidate of
    note, hires consultants. He hires from the same pool of consultants as everyone
    else in the Democratic Party. But he runs against his own consultants doing something
    that is completely anodyne. He’s not an especially populist politician. He’s not
    an especially outsider politician. And even he ran against his own consultants.
    Politicians do it all the time, and it cascades downward. The political appointees
    do not trust the civil service because the civil service is constantly told that
    they’re not allowed to talk back. Do you think the head of the MTA knows which
    civil servants to fire? He doesn’t know the difference between them.'

    decision by Andrew Cuomo. But he was an outsider to the United States, and he
    had experience as a professional in the industry his entire life.'

    that you guys look down on. Turkey is the biggest example, not even Italy. Learn
    from the right places. It’s not like the United States does not have a civil service,
    okay? It’s not Uganda. There are a lot of people who are, let’s say, my age, give
    or take a couple years, who have very good ideas. They’re just not being listened
    to. Stop trying to polarize against the civil service. Hire people who are not
    generalists or political appointees. If you need to hire an outsider, hire an
    outsider.

    to hire someone who’s a professional because all the successes will come from
    that. Byford is considered to have been a success in New York, and he became a
    superstar as a result. But if there are many like him in various parts of the
    United States, people will notice.
