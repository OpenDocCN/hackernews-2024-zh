    embarrassing and offensive results, in some cases declining to depict white people,
    or inserting photos of women or people of color when prompted to create images
    of Vikings, Nazis, and the Pope.

    and to avoid bias, especially in light of other experiences. For instance, image
    generation tools from companies like OpenAI have been criticized when they created
    predominately images of white people in professional roles and depicting Black
    people in stereotypical roles.
