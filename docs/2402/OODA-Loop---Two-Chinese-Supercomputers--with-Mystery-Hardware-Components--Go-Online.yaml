    in global benchmarking list of the world’s most powerful supercomputers.  So,
    the “top 500” list goes out – with the U.S. on top.  The lack of participation
    by the Chinese then fuels rumors that they in fact possess capabilities that transcend
    all the participants in the global benchmarking lists.  We take a comparative
    look at some supercomputer specs to see what the compute reality really is vis
    a vis Chinese supercomputing capabilities as reported by a few reputable outlets.
    While on the topics, we took a look at the Russians efforts and the latest on
    Telsa’s Dojo as well. *'
