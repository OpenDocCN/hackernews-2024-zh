- en: The EU’s internal electricity markets contribute to the overarching goal of
    creating an integrated economic space within the European Union, where the benefits
    for EU citizens and businesses bolster the European political project of collaboration
    and peace . On the one hand, the broader internal market requires that electricity
    regulation is not used by EU countries to distort the playing field in favour
    of their electricity-consuming companies. On the other hand, because of its technical
    characteristics, integrating electricity markets requires more than ensuring the
    absence of typical tariff and non-tariff barriers (see section 4 on the complexities
    of market integration).

    This is particularly useful in the electricity sector, which typically faces rather
    high degrees of concentration in purely national markets . As a result, integrating
    national markets into a larger European one substantially enhances competition.

    drive down cost, improve quality and spur technological advancements. Moreover,
    creation of a larger, more predictable market governed by common rules aimed at
    achieving energy policy goals of climate protection, security of supply and energy
    justice, engenders more credibility and trust among market participants, who also
    benefit from strengthened governance, independent regulatory authorities and unbundled
    market operators.

    pricing of externalities, and at the same time creating a conducive environment
    for renewable energy, amplifies investor confidence and lowers the cost of capital
    for clean technologies, which in turn is the main factor driving clean-tech cost
    competitiveness, thus reducing the cost of the energy transition.

- en: One of the primary benefits of the internal energy market is to stimulate competition
    between energy-market participants. Cross-border energy trade fosters a more dynamic
    marketplace, encouraging companies to strive for efficiency and cost-effectiveness.
    As competition intensifies, companies are compelled to innovate, seeking technological
    advancements and operational improvements to gain a competitive edge. A bigger,
    more uniform market also increases the expected profits from scaling-up better
    solutions, hence encouraging companies to innovate more. This can be expected
    to be seen in many innovative digital solutions that drive demand-side flexibility
    and contribute to faster and cheaper integration of variable renewable energy
    sources . Harmonisation of grid connectivity standards across the EU and national
    targeting of the many local barriers that inhibit the uptake of demand response
    and the participation of smaller distributed assets will contribute to further
    resilience and efficiency of power markets in the EU (ACER, 2023).

    the importance of credibility and trust in the energy sector. A unified and integrated
    market fosters reliability and predictability, both in market operation and achieving
    the desired level of security of supply, as well as in rules and regulations.
    As the market expands, it becomes more transparent and increases resilience in
    the face of sudden shocks or disruptions, improving everyday reliability and providing
    a framework for swift and coordinated action in the event of a crisis. More integration
    in the EU energy market, likely accompanied by further coordination in overall
    system planning and financing, also gives a sense of stability when it comes to
    the overall direction of EU energy and climate policy, because wider EU goals
    are more likely to be achieved. This transparency, resilience and stability, in
    turn, enhances the trust of consumers, investors and other market participants
    that make long-term investments in energy infrastructure. This trust is particularly
    important for enabling the development of large, critical energy-infrastructure
    projects such as offshore wind networks or the green hydrogen sector.

    EU countries continue to trade electricity with non-EU countries that are not
    part of the internal electricity market, including Switzerland, Morocco and the
    United Kingdom. Even within the EU, electricity trade arrangements can have very

    while the relative impact of short-term markets on final electricity bills has decreased.
    The share of wholesale prices in final energy prices in Germany, for example,
    declined from around 50 percent before 2010 to less than 20 percent before the
    energy crisis (Figure 13). One reason was that currently predominantly national
    instruments for investments, such as ubiquitous renewables support schemes and
    increasingly capacity mechanisms, gained in importance .

    to a decrease in wholesale prices across the EU is one example of how national
    and European, market and non-market, and short- and long-term instruments interact.
    Hence, coordination across borders is needed, even if only very shallow/specific
    forms of energy-market integration are chosen. Currently, increasingly sophisticated
    national measures proliferate, with responsibilities spread out over national
    ministries, regulators, market operators and transmission and distribution system
    operators. The EU electricity market design reform  of 2023 encouraged some simplification
    and harmonisation, but EU countries will likely maintain ample leeway to pile
    up national instruments and micro-manage the development of their power systems.

    system, but also about political cultures (state vs. market delineation), technology
    preferences (eg regarding nuclear or rooftop solar), and regional and industrial
    policy. Most importantly, distributional effects *within a country* strongly shape
    its preferences for certain market set-ups . Generators in one country might lose
    if a new transmission line makes supplies from cheaper foreign competitors available
    to consumers. At the same time, consumers in the exporting country might complain
    about increasing prices if ‘their’ cheap power is sold abroad.

    benefits, of relatively well-integrated EU electricity and gas markets. But paradoxically,
    the crisis also accelerated the pre-existing trend of fragmentation, rather than
    leading to more coordinated solutions. To achieve ‘more independence through more

    to improving the resilience and enabling the transition of Europe’s energy system.
    When done jointly, substantially less capital needs to be invested in additional
    power plants, and less fossil fuel needs to be burned than if each EU country
    optimises its system domestically. Moreover, the cost of the invested capital
    will be lower in a consistently regulated and predictable European market, and
    consumers would reap more of its benefits.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    since Europe is facing massive electricity-system investments, with greater risks
    of lock-in of more expensive, less-efficient choices, should member states opt
    for the more fragmented approach. Moreover, the current coordination arrangements,
    based on creating a joint European short-term market, have been gradually losing
    impact as national long-term instruments have become the dominant signal for investment.
    Hence, inaction at EU level implies member states might be forced to take back
    more control to safeguard their energy-policy objectives, potentially setting
    in motion a ‘death spiral’ for the internal energy market, reducing rather than
    enhancing all the benefits it has already delivered.
