    creating an integrated economic space within the European Union, where the benefits
    for EU citizens and businesses bolster the European political project of collaboration
    and peace . On the one hand, the broader internal market requires that electricity
    regulation is not used by EU countries to distort the playing field in favour
    of their electricity-consuming companies. On the other hand, because of its technical
    characteristics, integrating electricity markets requires more than ensuring the
    absence of typical tariff and non-tariff barriers (see section 4 on the complexities
    of market integration).

    competitiveness, thus reducing the cost of the energy transition.

    between energy-market participants. Cross-border energy trade fosters a more dynamic
    marketplace, encouraging companies to strive for efficiency and cost-effectiveness.
    As competition intensifies, companies are compelled to innovate, seeking technological
    advancements and operational improvements to gain a competitive edge. A bigger,
    more uniform market also increases the expected profits from scaling-up better
    solutions, hence encouraging companies to innovate more. This can be expected
    to be seen in many innovative digital solutions that drive demand-side flexibility
    and contribute to faster and cheaper integration of variable renewable energy
    sources . Harmonisation of grid connectivity standards across the EU and national
    targeting of the many local barriers that inhibit the uptake of demand response
    and the participation of smaller distributed assets will contribute to further
    resilience and efficiency of power markets in the EU (ACER, 2023).

    the importance of credibility and trust in the energy sector. A unified and integrated
    market fosters reliability and predictability, both in market operation and achieving
    the desired level of security of supply, as well as in rules and regulations.
    As the market expands, it becomes more transparent and increases resilience in
    the face of sudden shocks or disruptions, improving everyday reliability and providing
    a framework for swift and coordinated action in the event of a crisis. More integration
    in the EU energy market, likely accompanied by further coordination in overall
    system planning and financing, also gives a sense of stability when it comes to
    the overall direction of EU energy and climate policy, because wider EU goals
    are more likely to be achieved. This transparency, resilience and stability, in
    turn, enhances the trust of consumers, investors and other market participants
    that make long-term investments in energy infrastructure. This trust is particularly
    important for enabling the development of large, critical energy-infrastructure
    projects such as offshore wind networks or the green hydrogen sector.

    ministries, regulators, market operators and transmission and distribution system
