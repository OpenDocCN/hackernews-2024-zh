- en: One of Elixir’s core benefits, and the secret to its robustness and scalability,
    is its foundation on immutable data. Sometimes, though, immutability is just not
    a great fit for a particular task—but that task is only one part of a large project.
    Is it possible to enjoy the benefits of Elixir’s data model everywhere else, but
    carve out a little mutable exception for one area?

- en: A long-running Elixir project I’m involved in has just this problem. The project
    is delivered over the web, so moving away from Elixir as a whole is not on the
    cards because [Phoenix](https://www.phoenixframework.org/) is quite simply a cheat
    code for web development. We *could* hive off the mutable section into a microservice,
    but that would require significant architectural and management overhead. All
    we really need is a little escape hatch for a limited chunk of code, while still
    being within the same VM and able to interact normally with the rest of the service.

    and show the implementation of a trivial `add` function and then stop there. While
    that’s fine for demonstrating the bare minimum integration required, for me the
    interesting part of Rustler is the chance to escape in a controlled way from the
    immutable world—I want to explore how to manage a little mutable chunk of memory
    in a safe way. Although Rustler is certainly capable of this, there’s very little
    available in the way of tutorials or examples.

    between the two worlds. This acts as a handle to a piece of memory; it can be
    returned from a NIF and then passed back into another call. Exactly what we need.

- en: A BEAM `Resource` is represented in Rustler by a `rustler::resource::ResourceArc<T>`
    struct. To get started with our implementation, let’s define a new type that we
    can use as a handle to represent the state of our graph store.
  id: totrans-split-33

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In a production scenario we’re likely to want to manage more state than this,
    but for now it will suffice to define a `MyGraph` struct that just contains (via
    a mutex) the Oxigraph data store; this represents the mutable data we want to
    manage outside Elixir. In the future, more fields could be added to `MyGraph`
    as necessary.

    and Rust, we need to wrap it in a `ResourceArc`. In order to make our function
    signatures a bit more readable we’ll define a new type of `GraphArc` to represent
    a `MyGraph` struct in a `ResourceArc`.

    will feel very familiar to Elixir code, it will need to both take and return a
    `GraphArc` handle. We’ll also have it accept a single string to use for all three
    parts of the triple to store (normally of course we’d take different strings for
    the subject, predicate, and object parts of the triple, but our focus here isn’t
    on SPARQL—we just want some data to store.)

    `state`.

    than running a query (which would require getting into more SPARQL) we’ll just
    dump the whole database and return it as a string. As before, our new function
    will need to accept a `GraphArc`, but this time we’ll return an `OwnedBinary`,
    which allows us to send a binary back to the BEAM and then wash our hands of it.

    more opportunities than just calculating things more quickly. Being able to opt
    out of the standard BEAM memory model for specific sections of code can open the
    doors to custom data stores and other features that would not generally be a good
    fit for Elixir, while still allowing you to use the power of Phoenix for the majority
    of your application… all with virtually seamless integration.
