- en: After months of resisting, Air Canada was [forced](https://www.canlii.org/en/bc/bccrt/doc/2024/2024bccrt149/2024bccrt149.html)
    to give a partial refund to a grieving passenger who was misled by an airline
    chatbot inaccurately explaining the airline's bereavement travel policy.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: On the day Jake Moffatt's grandmother died, Moffat immediately visited Air Canada's
    website to book a flight from Vancouver to Toronto. Unsure of how Air Canada's
    bereavement rates worked, Moffatt asked Air Canada's chatbot to explain.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The chatbot provided inaccurate information, encouraging Moffatt to book a flight
    immediately and then request a refund within 90 days. In reality, Air Canada's
    policy explicitly stated that the airline will not provide refunds for bereavement
    travel after the flight is booked. Moffatt dutifully attempted to follow the chatbot's
    advice and request a refund but was shocked that the request was rejected.

    submit your ticket for a reduced bereavement rate, kindly do so within 90 days

- en: Air Canada argued that because the chatbot response elsewhere linked to a page
    with the actual bereavement travel policy, Moffatt should have known bereavement
    rates could not be requested retroactively. Instead of a refund, the best Air
    Canada would do was to promise to update the chatbot and offer Moffatt a $200
    coupon to use on a future flight.

    complaint in Canada's Civil Resolution Tribunal.

- en: According to Air Canada, Moffatt never should have trusted the chatbot and the
    airline should not be liable for the chatbot's misleading information because,
    Air Canada essentially argued, "the chatbot is a separate legal entity that is
    responsible for its own actions," a [court order](https://www.canlii.org/en/bc/bccrt/doc/2024/2024bccrt149/2024bccrt149.html)

    of its agents, servants, or representatives—including a chatbot," Rivers wrote.

    ''Bereavement travel'' was inherently more trustworthy than its chatbot."'

    of Air Canada's website would be accurate and another would not.

    in Canadian dollars off the original fare (about $482 USD), which was $1,640.36
    CAD (about $1,216 USD), as well as additional damages to cover interest on the
