- en: Australia last week passed a Right To Disconnect law that forbids employers
    contacting workers after hours, with penalties including jail time for bosses
    who do the wrong thing.

- en: The criminal sanction will soon be overturned – it was the result of parliamentary
    shenanigans rather than the government's intent – and the whole law could go too
    if opposition parties and business groups have their way.

    Right To Disconnect laws in response to digital devices blurring the boundaries
    between working hours and personal time. The laptops or phones employers provide
    have obvious after-hours uses, but also mean workers can find themselves browsing
    emailed or texted messages from their boss at all hours – sometimes with an expectation
    of a response. That expectation, labor rights orgs argue, extends the working
    day without increasing pay.

    to messages from work" laws because that's what they seek to guarantee.

    of Australia's law is that it will give employees the opportunity to seek an order
    "that the employer stops unreasonable out of hours contact."

- en: Reasonable contact concerns issues like availability to work – the kind of contact
    that casual employees may well welcome. But being asked to perform work out of
    hours could be refused under the law.

    the laws as a sensible post-COVID rebalancing, and claimed many workers perform
    up to 280 hours per year of unpaid work.

    which so far has only passed the nation's Senate and needs to be confirmed by
    the House of Representatives – to remove the criminal penalties for bosses who
    dare to send after-hours emails.

    operators of digital platforms – Australian legal-speak for gig-work platforms
    like Uber – to set minimum standards so that rideshare drivers, delivery drives,
    and other gig workers are afforded "employee-like" benefits even if they are on
    the books as independent contractors. ®
