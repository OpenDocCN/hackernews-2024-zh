    check accommodations for bed bug defecation stains: on mattress seams, furniture
    and behind headboards. (The insects poop as frequently as a few dozen times after
    every blood meal, often right next to their victims.) Suitcases should be kept
    in the hotel bathtub or wrapped in a plastic bag. Upon arrival back home, the
    luggage’s contents should be put into the clothes dryer for at least 30 minutes
    at the highest setting, or into a very cold freezer for several days.'

- en: If bed bugs do invade a home, “the biggest mistake is to try and get rid of
    them on one’s own,” says Doggett. “The average person doesn’t appreciate how challenging
    it is to control bed bugs and will use supermarket insecticides that are labeled
    for bed bugs but don’t work. The infestation will spread, and the costs escalate.”

  zh: 如果床虫确实侵入家中，“最大的错误是试图自行清除它们”，Doggett说道。“普通人不了解控制床虫的挑战性，会使用标有床虫但无效的超市杀虫剂。这会导致虫害扩散，成本不断增加。”
