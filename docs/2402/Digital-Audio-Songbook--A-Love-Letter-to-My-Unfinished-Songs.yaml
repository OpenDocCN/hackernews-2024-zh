    Maybe it seems self-indulgent, or that doing so must mean you’re full of yourself.
    But if you’ve made any music at all, you’ve made it because *you* like the way
    it sounds. Every chord, every note, or phrase is in there because you were into
    it. Why wouldn’t you listen?

    wax lyrical about the multi-track tape recorders they cut their teeth on coming
    up. As it turns out, this was the technology that started the home recording revolution
    we now find ourselves in. The most notable example being the [Tascam Portastudio](https://reverb.com/au/news/the-tascam-portastudio-through-the-ages).
    The original demo of George Michael’s Careless Whisper was recorded on the Portastudio.
    As was the entirety of Bruce Springsteen’s 1982 album [Nebraska](https://performermag.com/music-news/how-bruce-springsteens-nebraska-sparked-a-home-recording-revolution/),
    and Elliot Smith’s debut [Roman Candle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Candle_(album)).
    These are musicians, not sound engineers. If I can make Prototape a modern, multiplayer
    blend of the Portastudio, a loop pedal, and put it all in the browser - we might
    be in business.

    by one musician and the moment it is heard by the other. This delay can disrupt
    the synchronicity required for musicians to play in time with each other. Less
    than 10 milliseconds of latency is generally considered imperceptible to humans
    and is the ideal target for real-time audio interactions. Once you’re above 10-25ms
    it starts to become noticeable and rules out playing music of any meaningful rhythmic
    complexity. Above 50ms and it’s nearly impossible to play in-sync with others.
  id: totrans-split-44

- en: Over the internet, you’re looking at latency of 20-100ms or more. This isn’t
    even the only variable - when you’re just recording into a DAW using an audio
    interface, no internet involved, there is still latency introduced by the interface
    and your laptop processing the signal; typically 1-10ms.

  id: totrans-split-52
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 1\. **Chords & Key:** When you record a track, Prototape will analyse the audio
    file to detect all the chords contained within it, as well as the root key it’s
    in. Not only will this save time transcribing your song so you can remember how
    to play it, it will also leverage this information to suggest other chords and
    progressions in the same key. You can use this information to write other sections,
    and ultimately finish your song.
  id: totrans-split-53

  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    write your lyrics down for you. Down the line I’ll also be integrating an AI assistant
    which can provide feedback on your lyrics, and help you expand on themes you’ve
    already brought to the table. I firmly believe in augmenting songwriters with
    AI, not replacing them.

- en: 1\. **Pause:** It may sound ridiculous, but as of today you can’t pause playback
    of your song. When you click stop, playback will start from the beginning the
    next time you click play. As it turns out - quite obviously, in hindsight - this
    makes it tricky to overdub on longer tracks, because you can’t easily punch-in
    to record from a particular timestamp. Instead, you’ve got to play the song and
    hit record at the right time. A little embarrassing, but this kind of oversight
    can happen when you’re building something like this solo as I am.

    file you import, but you can’t upload multiple files. This is often the case if
    you’re exporting stems from Ableton, for example. I’ll fix this too.

    Voice Memos or something similar. Naturally, a lot of folks try to use Prototape
    on their phone - go figure. Since Prototape is a browser application, this is
    tricky for device compatibility reasons. For now I’m prioritising desktop use,
    but rest assured this is on my radar and it will be addressed.
