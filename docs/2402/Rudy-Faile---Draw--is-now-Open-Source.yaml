    of the purpose of making it (ship something using C and [raylib](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib))
    I have decided after [publishing the game on the web last week](https://rudyfaile.com/2020/08/01/draw-is-now-playable/),
    to [open source the code on GitHub](https://github.com/rfaile313/draw_game) under
    the very permissive [MIT License](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).

    is now public. The code itself isn’t the finest example of best practices programming
    or game development programming, but there is a single dependency (raylib) and
    I can say with confidence that I wrote every line of the code from scratch. There
    are also some [live videos out there for most of the development process](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6rlTtGrld4&list=PL4S_BY15GtahZswoQWexPodfXMVgyq32f).

    MacOS, and Web (HTML5/WASM). It’s never code I’ll look back on and think is great,
    but it *is* code that I’m proud to have written. It also served its purpose: make
    a small game from scratch in C programming, and learn and use raylib.'

    awesome recognition!

    programming or raylib can have another source of reference for a working, published
    game. Perhaps someone will even fork the project and improve on it, isn’t open
    source amazing? 😁

    are some work projects that are taking up the bulk of my time, but in addition
    to that, I plan on participating in [Miziziziz](https://twitter.com/miziziziz)‘s
    [48 hour game jam](https://itch.io/jam/miz-jam-1) in four days. I was thinking
    about using [Godot](https://godotengine.org/) for the first time in this jam to
    learn it, but I also might use C and Raylib 😁. The concept of these jams that
    Miziziziz does is pretty cool: multiple game developers use the same art kit and
    have 48 hours to create a game with it. Here’s an example:'

    times. Exercising a bit and trying to stay sharp and productive – I have also
    been playing a little bit of Starcraft2 and Hearthstone after a long, long break
    from gaming in general 😊.

    chip away at for a long time. I have some ideas, and I’m thinking about an RPG/Roguelike
    as the general idea, but hopefully completely different than anything anyone’s
    seen before. I have some ideas 🤠.
