    the device had generated when I had pointed its curved, glass front at my face
    during setup. I couldn’t see the me that she saw, but apparently it was uncanny.
    You look handsome and refined, she told me, but also fake.

    hope for what it would represent. The headset, which weighs as much as a cauliflower
    and sells for $3,499 and up, is now—after eight months of hype [since its announcement](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2023/06/apple-vision-pro-ar-headset-metaverse/674303/)—finally
    available. The Apple Vision Pro offers two innovations in one: a virtual-reality
    (VR) headset with a higher resolution than most others on the market, and an array
    of augmented-reality (AR) cameras that allow a wearer to see ordinary computer
    applications floating in space, and to interact with them via hand gestures. To
    make the AR work, a knob on the top of the device can dial back your level of
    “immersion” in a simulated space and replace it with a live video feed of your
    surroundings, overlaid in real time with computer programs: web browsers, spreadsheets,
    photo viewers, Disney+. It’s this latter function that most distinguishes the
    device from other headsets—and from other machines in general. Computers help
    people work, live, and play, but they also separate us from the world. Apple Vision
    Pro strives to end that era and inaugurate a new one.'

    I roboticized my diction, she seemed to think that it helped. I was joking, but
    then, in a way, I also wasn’t. I did feel like I’d been turned into a robot person
    of some kind. Is that what the creators of these goggles hoped for, or was it
    just what I expected? If the Apple Vision Pro wants to reconcile life outside
    the computer and life within it, the challenge might be insurmountable.

    around me, I found that I was looking out into my living room, across my couches,
    through the window onto the street, across the craggy winter treetops, and up
    into the overcast sky. The dual displays, one for each eye, are so sharp and update
    so quickly that you feel, at first, as though you’re looking at the world as you
    see it, not how it’s been reconstructed by a headset. At least you feel that way
    until a row of Apple-app icons materializes in the air in front of you.

    Pro. The round-cornered windows floating above my coffee table looked crisp, but
    I wasn’t looking only at them. Still feeling stuck in the technological past of
    earlier in the day, I kept looking down at my phone through the headset. In Apple
    Vision, the iPhone’s screen was legible but smeared, as if taken from a dream
    or an AI’s rendering. Checking email seemed impossible, or irritating at the very
    least; so did sending texts or using Slack. I took a headset screenshot of my
    view looking at the phone (and at my lap, and at my living room) and sent it to
    my friends. They egged me on: *Get in the car! Go to the grocery store!*'

    wearing the Apple Vision Pro. The device will convince you that you can see areas
    beyond it, but it renders that space only as trompe l’œil. I had no trouble getting
    up from the couch to grab my laptop from the other room, but the world jittered
    in the display, sprouting fuzz around its edges. Objects throbbed in time with
    my footfalls. Every jostle or cough made reality shudder. This was a rapidly updating
    computer-desktop-background version of the world, rather than a view of things
    as they really are.

    built-in “environments”—virtual scenes with animation and sound—that blend in
    and out of view as you turn the knob on the visor’s top. Using my eyes as a mouse,
    I selected White Sands, a view of a turbulent sky over the gypsum dunes of southern
    New Mexico.

    to my laptop and cast my Mac display into my augmented reality as a virtual screen.
    Typing via finger pinches or dictation was a pain, so I used a wireless keyboard.
    Even that had problems. Touch-typing in that context wasn’t easy, and the writing
    felt out of phase. The letters on the screen appeared after a very slight delay,
    just enough to make it feel like my words were being pulled through a wormhole
    on their way into my document.

    This is how I’d thought the Apple Vision Pro might best be used—as a virtual office,
    a place to work that is an actual *place* and not just a little screen on a table
    or a desk. The posture benefits were immediate: I was sitting upright, my back
    against a cushion, my head straight, my eyes focused on the horizon (and the future?).
    I felt like an illustration in a workplace-ergonomics poster. I felt good.'

    Word, and now I couldn’t find that window. It was stuck, somewhere in virtual
    space, in another room of my house. Looking side to side, I finally saw the foreshortened
    sliver of my document in the living-room doorway. I tried to pinch it, but couldn’t
    quite reach. So I opened Word anew, on my laptop, in my headset. Now I began to
    feel afraid, like I’d gone so deep inside computerspace that I would never get
    out again. Thunder clapped in my ears from the background environment. I was alone
    in the wilderness, in the goggles wrapped around my head.

    was the last thing I needed while I felt like I was drowning. So I switched myself
    into the Mount Hood environment, with its lakeside vista, lined in evergreens,
    and its gentle chirp of birds. It helped. Light glinted across the water next
    to a window bearing text messages from my family. But then a clang and a notice
    interrupted my newfound peace: 20 percent battery remaining. I had to plug in
    my peaceful, lakefront office to recharge it.'

    more than growing pains for this new paradigm for computing. The original Macintosh
    was only marginally useful, and the first iPhone didn’t do that much. So I settled
    back into Word in space, tapping out a portion of this article while the experience
    was fresh. A reality-affirming rocky shore with proud trees filled my peripheral
    vision. Eventually, I heard the sounds of my wife and daughter coming back into
    the house. When I dialed back into reality, or the rendered version of the world
    around me, I found my wife was just steps away from my head, pointing her phone
    camera to record me, the computer man.

    to scratch my brow but a face computer stood in the way. I was more off-kilter
    than expected. Augmented reality is supposed to increase your sense of place compared
    with VR, but I’ve tried the older, lower-resolution options—the Meta Quest, the
    HTC Vive—and the Apple Vision Pro made me feel even more decoupled from the world.

    toward the kitchen, headset-free, past the place where, in the Apple Vision Pro
    dimension, I’d left my document. I began devouring Tostitos, as if to reaffirm
    my corporeal existence. My wife tried to tell me about her day, our daughter’s
    fiddle lesson, the dog she’d nearly hit with the car. But I couldn’t listen. I
    felt agitated. She had no idea what had just happened to me. If someone had just
    come back from outer space or a deep-sea submarine, you wouldn’t expect them to
    make small talk.

    This time I’d try it out as a media device rather than a general-purpose computer.
    Watching movies—I chose *Avatar: The Way of Water*, for obvious reasons—is spectacular,
    so long as you can tolerate the headset’s weight on your face for hours. It’s
    like watching the biggest, brightest television you’ve ever seen, at the proper
    distance, in a dark room. Games have promise, too: An AR version of *Fruit Ninja*
    dumped cartoonish orange and watermelon juices onto my carpet. I had trouble getting
    the game to recognize my hand movements, but it felt like the special, physical
    experience you’d have at an arcade. And an Apple TV+ show called *Adventure* put
    me on a tightrope high over a Norwegian fjord with the highliner Faith Dickey.
    The company has branded such content as Apple Immersive Video, a combination of
    3-D, 8K resolution, and spatial sound. It was the sharpest, most eye-watering
    film I’ve ever seen, but it also felt a little corny, like a tech-demo nature
    show playing at Best Buy. I’ve pursued such thrills in the past only to abandon
    them in favor of watching YouTube on an iPhone six inches from my face in bed.'

    or moving image. In Apple’s marketing and in Apple Vision Pro reviews, these “spatial”
    recordings have been sold as a way to relive your past—children feature prominently.
    I found these videos neither immersive nor crisp. With edges that blend into the
    background, they come off like a gesture toward the past, one that amplifies the
    tender, connotative feelings of a moment, but that may not quite convey what really
    happened. I can’t tell if that will give us stronger memories, or just more saccharine
    ones. (Or maybe, as Kathryn Bigelow’s cyberpunk film, *Strange Days*, predicted
    in 1995, spatial videos will just end up as a more visceral way to consume violence
    and pornography.)

    lived experience suggests the grander Apple vision. With the release of this device,
    the company is trying to reconcile, once and for all, the digital and physical
    worlds. Apple has probably done enough, even in this early iteration, to convince
    many users that such a bridge can and will be built. The device is incredible
    already, and Apple may yet resolve the quirks that troubled me. (I may yet become
    accustomed to them, too.)

    to technology? For a time, at what may have been the height of the internet’s
    thrall, it became popular to pretend that the digital and material worlds were
    continuous—that the “real” one had no [special meaning](https://thesocietypages.org/cyborgology/2011/02/24/digital-dualism-versus-augmented-reality/),
    because cyberspace had become a part of it. That turned out to be wrong. We live
    in cars and on couches and, separately, we also live on phones. Apple believes
    it can resolve this conflict—that the digital and material worlds can be merged
    together—but it has only put the conflict into higher resolution. A headset is
    a pair of spectacles, but a headset is also a blindfold.
