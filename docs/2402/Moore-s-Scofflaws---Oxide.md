# Moore's Scofflaws / Oxide

> 来源：[https://oxide.computer/blog/moores-scofflaws](https://oxide.computer/blog/moores-scofflaws)

Years ago, Jeff Bezos famously quipped that "your margin is my opportunity." This was of course aimed not at Amazon’s customers, but rather its competitors, and it was deadly serious: customers of AWS in those bygone years will fondly remember that every re:Invent brought with it another round of price cuts. This era did not merely reflect Bezos’s relentless execution, but also a disposition towards who should reap the reward of advances in underlying technology: Amazon believed (if implicitly) that improvements at the foundations of computing (e.g., in transistor density, core count, DRAM density, storage density, etc.) should reflect themselves in lower prices for consumers rather than higher margins for suppliers.

Price cuts are no longer a re:Invent staple, having been replaced by a regular Amazon tradition of a different flavor: cutting depreciation (and therefore increasing earnings) by [extending the effective life of their servers](https://www.theregister.com/2024/02/02/amazon_q4_2023/). (These announcements are understandably much more subdued, as "my depreciation is my margin opportunity" doesn’t have quite the same ring to it.)

As compute needs have grown and price cuts have become an increasingly distant memory, some have questioned their sky-high cloud bills, wondering if they should in fact be owning their compute instead of renting it. When we started Oxide, we knew from operating our own public cloud what those economics looked like — and we knew that over time others of a particular scale would come to the same realization that they would be better off not giving their margin away by renting compute. (Though it’s safe to say that we did not predict that it would be [DHH leading the charge](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a30vFpSaoZg)!)

Owning one’s own cloud sounds great, but there is a bit that’s unsaid: **what about the software?** Software is essential for elastic, automated infrastructure: hardware alone does not a cloud make! Unfortunately, the traditional server vendors do not help here: because of a PC-era divide in how systems are delivered, customers are told to look elsewhere for any and all system software. This divide is problematic on several levels. First, it impedes the hardware/software co-design that we (and, famously, [others](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAfTXYa36f4)!) believe is essential to deliver the best possible product. Second, it leads to [infamous finger pointing](https://twitter.com/_sysengineer/status/1487149172637712386) when the whole thing doesn’t work. But there is also a thorny economic problem: when your hardware and your software don’t come from the same provider, **to whom should go the spoils of better hardware?**

To someone who has just decided to buy their hardware out of their frustration with renting it, the answer feels obvious: whoever owns the hardware should naturally benefit from its advances! Unfortunately, the enterprise software vendor delivering your infrastructure often has other ideas — and because their software is neither rented nor bought, but rather comes from the hinterlands of software licensing, they have broad latitude as to how it is priced and used. In particular, this allows them to charge based on the hardware that you run it on — to have **per-core software licensing.**

This galling practice isn’t new (and is in fact as old as symmetric multiprocessing systems), but it has taken on new dimensions in the era of [chiplets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chiplet) and packaging innovation: the advances that your next CPU has over your current one are very likely to be expressed in core count. Per-core licensing allows a third party — who neither made the significant investment in developing the next generation of microprocessor nor paid for the part themselves — to exact a tax on improved infrastructure. (And this tax can be [shockingly brazen](https://news.vmware.com/company/cpu-pricing-model-update-feb-2020)!) Couple this with [the elimination of perpetual licensing](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/12/broadcom-ends-vmware-perpetual-license-sales-testing-customers-and-partners/), and software costs can potentially absorb the entire gain from a next-generation CPU, leaving a disincentive to run newer, more efficient infrastructure. As an industry, we have come to accept this practice, but we shouldn’t: in the go-go era of [Dennard scaling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dennard_scaling) (when clock rates rose at a blistering rate), software vendors never would have been allowed to get away with charging by the gigahertz; we should not allow them to feel so emboldened to charge by core count now!

If it needs to be said, we have taken a different approach at Oxide: when you buy the [Oxide cloud computer](/blog/the-cloud-computer), **all of the software to run it is included**. This includes all of the software necessary to run the rack as elastic infrastructure: [virtual compute](/product/compute), [virtual storage](/product/storage), [virtual networking](/product/networking). (And yes, it’s all open source — which unfortunately demands the immediate clarification that it’s [*actually* open source](https://opensource.org/osd/) rather than [pretend open source](https://bcantrill.dtrace.org/2018/12/16/a-eula-in-foss-clothing/).) When we add a new feature to our software, there is no licensing enablement or other such nuisance — the feature just comes with the next update. And what happens when AMD releases a new CPU with twice the core count? The new sled running the new CPU runs along your existing rack — you’re not paying more than the cost of the new sled itself. This gives the dividends of Moore’s Law (or [Wright’s Law](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cuvp-e4ztC0)!) to whom they rightfully belong: the users of compute.
