    Friday frenzy. Here at *The Register* we prefer to end the working week in a gentler
    fashion by offering a fresh installment of On Call, the reader-contributed column
    in which we share stories of haters who hated IT, fakers who faked technical nous,
    and techies who shook it off and got the job done.

    time he worked for a shipping company as its first ever official IT manager.

    relied on a first-gen IBM AS400 that "acted like a petulant two year old most
    of the time."

    it extremely unreliable and earned it the name "Little Darling." The IT team he
    inherited learned to work around the box's moods, but havoc still ensued when
    the machine wobbled.

    hardware.

    migration extensively – even using his phone to snap plenty of photos depicting
    the AS400's cabling and innards just in case a rebuild was needed.

- en: The cutover to the new boxes duly happened and Travis was authorized to decommission
    the AS400\. He was also required to pack it away carefully as an insurance policy.
    The server was labelled, boxed, and left in a state that should have made reassembly
    feasible. Travis kept his photos, and a colleague we'll call "Dave" who had spent
    years nurturing Little Darling took home the AS400 documentation – partly out
    of nostalgia and partly as he feared it would otherwise be lost.

    was no longer needed – waiting for his exit interview.'

    left behind to suffer, so contemplated sending his images straight to his former
    teammates. He also felt that, while senior management were scoundrels, maybe they
    were due a little kindness too.
