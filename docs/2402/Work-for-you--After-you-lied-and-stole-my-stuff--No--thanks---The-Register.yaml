- en: On Call Taylor Swift is playing in On Call's town tonight, creating a city-wide
    Friday frenzy. Here at *The Register* we prefer to end the working week in a gentler
    fashion by offering a fresh installment of On Call, the reader-contributed column
    in which we share stories of haters who hated IT, fakers who faked technical nous,
    and techies who shook it off and got the job done.

- en: This week, meet a reader we'll Regomize as "Travis," who let us know about the
    time he worked for a shipping company as its first ever official IT manager.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: His first job was to modernize its back-end infrastructure, which at the time
    relied on a first-gen IBM AS400 that "acted like a petulant two year old most
    of the time."
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Travis told us it had wiring issues that nobody could ever pinpoint, which made
    it extremely unreliable and earned it the name "Little Darling." The IT team he
    inherited learned to work around the box's moods, but havoc still ensued when
    the machine wobbled.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Armed with a hefty budget, he set about replacing Little Darling with new IBM
    hardware.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That effort took three months. Travis is a cautious chap, so documented the
    migration extensively – even using his phone to snap plenty of photos depicting
    the AS400's cabling and innards just in case a rebuild was needed.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The cutover to the new boxes duly happened and Travis was authorized to decommission
    the AS400\. He was also required to pack it away carefully as an insurance policy.
    The server was labelled, boxed, and left in a state that should have made reassembly
    feasible. Travis kept his photos, and a colleague we'll call "Dave" who had spent
    years nurturing Little Darling took home the AS400 documentation – partly out
    of nostalgia and partly as he feared it would otherwise be lost.

    techies were let go in the name of "cost cutting."

- en: '"I decided later that with the modernization project done, they no longer needed
    me." His job had therefore been a sham and his employer knew it.'

    personal leather portfolio and removed all business cards and any page with anything
    written on the notepad.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '"The ripped ends of paper showed where they had been crudely ripped off," Travis
    lamented. But he hardly had time to contemplate the wreckage as he was led out
    of the building by HR. On his way out he saw Dave – who, as an AS400 specialist,
    was no longer needed – waiting for his exit interview.'

    that Little Darling could produce a certain report that its replacement could
    not.
  prefs: []

- en: Might Travis have kept any notes describing how to revive the machine? The report
    was needed urgently, so assistance would be appreciated.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '"I replied that all notes had been ripped out of my portfolio, so they already
    had them," Travis replied, before HR asked if Dave might want to help.'
  prefs: []

    photos he'd taken of Little Darling.
  prefs: []

- en: He didn't want to help HR. But he also didn't want his erstwhile colleagues
    left behind to suffer, so contemplated sending his images straight to his former
    teammates. He also felt that, while senior management were scoundrels, maybe they
    were due a little kindness too.

    to his old mates, HR intervened.

    phone, before slamming it down. It was clear then that they were never ever ever
    getting back together.'

    deleted each picture in turn," Travis told On Call.
