- en: On Call Taylor Swift is playing in On Call's town tonight, creating a city-wide
    Friday frenzy. Here at *The Register* we prefer to end the working week in a gentler
    fashion by offering a fresh installment of On Call, the reader-contributed column
    in which we share stories of haters who hated IT, fakers who faked technical nous,
    and techies who shook it off and got the job done.

  zh: On Call泰勒·斯威夫特（Taylor Swift）今晚将在On Call的城市演出，引发了整个城市的星期五狂热。在*The Register*这里，我们更倾向于以温和的方式结束工作周，通过提供On
    Call的新内容，这是一项读者投稿的专栏，我们在其中分享了一些IT不友好的故事，一些假装懂技术的人，还有一些技术人员摇摇摆摆但最终完成了工作的故事。
- en: This week, meet a reader we'll Regomize as "Travis," who let us know about the
    time he worked for a shipping company as its first ever official IT manager.

  zh: 本周，让我们遇见一位读者，我们将他称为“特拉维斯”，他向我们讲述了他曾在一家运输公司担任首位正式IT经理的经历。
- en: His first job was to modernize its back-end infrastructure, which at the time
    relied on a first-gen IBM AS400 that "acted like a petulant two year old most
    of the time."
  id: totrans-split-8
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 他的第一个工作是要对后端基础设施进行现代化改造，当时依赖于一台第一代IBM AS400，这台服务器“大部分时间都像一个脾气暴躁的两岁儿童”。
- en: Travis told us it had wiring issues that nobody could ever pinpoint, which made
    it extremely unreliable and earned it the name "Little Darling." The IT team he
    inherited learned to work around the box's moods, but havoc still ensued when
    the machine wobbled.
  id: totrans-split-9

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 特拉维斯告诉我们，这个服务器有着无法定位的布线问题，使得它极其不可靠，因此得了“小亲爱”这个绰号。他所在的IT团队学会了如何绕过这个服务器的心情，但当这台机器摇摆不定时还是会带来混乱。
- en: Armed with a hefty budget, he set about replacing Little Darling with new IBM
    hardware.
  id: totrans-split-10

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 凭借着宽裕的预算，他着手用新的IBM硬件取代小亲爱。
- en: That effort took three months. Travis is a cautious chap, so documented the
    migration extensively – even using his phone to snap plenty of photos depicting
    the AS400's cabling and innards just in case a rebuild was needed.
  id: totrans-split-11
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 这项工作花了三个月。特拉维斯是一个谨慎的人，因此彻底记录了迁移工作——甚至使用他的手机拍摄了大量描述AS400的布线和内部构造的照片，以防需要重新组建时使用。
- en: The cutover to the new boxes duly happened and Travis was authorized to decommission
    the AS400\. He was also required to pack it away carefully as an insurance policy.
    The server was labelled, boxed, and left in a state that should have made reassembly
    feasible. Travis kept his photos, and a colleague we'll call "Dave" who had spent
    years nurturing Little Darling took home the AS400 documentation – partly out
    of nostalgia and partly as he feared it would otherwise be lost.

  zh: 然后，迁移到新设备顺利进行，特拉维斯得到授权停用AS400。他还被要求仔细地包装起来作为一项保险政策。服务器被贴上标签，装箱，留在一个状态下，应该使得重新组装成为可能。特拉维斯保留了他的照片，而与此同时，一位被我们称为“戴夫”的同事，他花了几年的时间培养小亲爱，带走了AS400的文档——部分是出于怀旧，部分是因为他担心否则会丢失。

  zh: 但一个月后，在星期一早上的第一件事，特拉维斯和其他六名技术人员以“为了削减成本”为名被解雇了。

    me." His job had therefore been a sham and his employer knew it.'

  zh: “后来我决定，随着现代化项目的完成，他们再也不需要我了。” 他的工作因此成了一场欺骗，他的雇主心知肚明。

    personal leather portfolio and removed all business cards and any page with anything
    written on the notepad.

  zh: 在特拉维斯被解雇的时候，他的雇主还去了他的办公桌，打开了他的个人皮夹，并拿走了所有的名片和任何一页写有内容的记事本。
- en: '"The ripped ends of paper showed where they had been crudely ripped off," Travis
    lamented. But he hardly had time to contemplate the wreckage as he was led out
    of the building by HR. On his way out he saw Dave – who, as an AS400 specialist,
    was no longer needed – waiting for his exit interview.'

  zh: “撕裂的纸的边缘显示了它们是怎么被粗暴地撕下来的，” 特拉维斯叹息说。但他几乎没有时间去思考这一切，因为他被人力资源部带出了建筑物。在离开的途中他看到了戴夫——作为AS400专家，他再也不被需要了——等待着进行离职面谈。

    that Little Darling could produce a certain report that its replacement could
    not.

    was needed urgently, so assistance would be appreciated.

- en: He didn't want to help HR. But he also didn't want his erstwhile colleagues
    left behind to suffer, so contemplated sending his images straight to his former
    teammates. He also felt that, while senior management were scoundrels, maybe they
    were due a little kindness too.

  zh: 他不想帮助人力资源部。但他也不想让他的从前的同事们陷入困境，于是考虑直接把照片发给他的前同事们。他也觉得，虽然高级管理人员是流氓，也许他们也应该得到一些善意。
