["```\nI introduced some tests in a feature branch to match the contents of\n`/etc/nginx/router_routes.conf`. They worked fine when run with `bundle exec\nrake spec` or `bundle exec rspec modules/router/spec`. But when run as\n`bundle exec rake` each should block failed with:\n\n    ArgumentError:\n      invalid byte sequence in US-ASCII \n```", "```\nArgumentError:\n  invalid byte sequence in US-ASCII \n```", "```\nI eventually found that removing the `.with_content(//)` matchers made the\nerrors go away. That there weren't any weird characters in the spec file. And\nthat it could be reproduced by requiring Puppet in the same interpreter \n```", "```\nNow the tests work! One hour of my life I won't get back.. \n```"]
