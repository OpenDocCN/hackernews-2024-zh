- en: I needed a simple tool to download currency rates from an HTTP server (See [Dancer](/mine/dancer)
    above), and I found **httpget**. On November 11, 1996 Rafael Sagula had released
    the first version of that tool named httpget 0.1 and I found it just days after
    his release. This was a rudimentary tool that almost did what I wanted. I fixed
    a bug or two in it and sent my improvements back to Rafael over email.

    to "take over" maintenance since I had kept on sending improvements his way –
    and I did.

- en: In August the following year, while still using httpget to get currencies for
    my bot service I found a site that provided more currencies. Since these new rates
    were hosted on a GOPHER site I had to add support for another protocol to the
    tool, which at the same time made the name wrong. It was no longer just HTTP it
    would get. I renamed it to **urlget** a few months later, and by then it also
    supported FTP downloads. By then it was portable enough so that it built and ran
    on multiple Unix systems as well as Windows, Amiga and more.

- en: When we moved into 1998, the tool had been improved further and could now do
    both FTP uploads and HTTP POST and the tool name had again started to feel wrong
    and unsuitable. It really did not just "get" URLs anymore. I released the final
    urlget version (3.12) on March 14 1998, then renamed the tool to **curl** and
    did the first curl release almost a week later with a bumped version number. On
    Friday March 20, 1998 I shipped curl 4.0.

    Open Source authors were cool and I wanted to be part of that group as well. I
    wanted curl to run everywhere and I knew that I would not be able to make it a
    universal tool on my own, nor would I alone be able to fix all bugs and add all
    potential new features. It had to be Open Source to go places.

    2000 we introduced **libcurl** to the world. A library that would bring "curl
    powers" to applications that wanted it.

    I joined the company [wolfSSL](https://wolfssl.com) and started offering commercial
    curl support and could finally work on curl full-time. Something of a dream that
    came true.
