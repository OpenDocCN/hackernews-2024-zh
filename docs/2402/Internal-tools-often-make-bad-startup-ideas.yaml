    because it’s likely that if it's very useful at one company, it's very useful
    at others.

- en: Although a tool may be valuable for many companies, software engineers — who
    are often influencers in a purchase decision — are strongly incentivized to build
    instead of buy. They like building stuff, and even if they didn’t, you’ll find
    “Built system that cut costs” much more often than “Purchased software that cut
    costs” in a successful promotion packet.

- en: A corollary of this is that internal tools that require developers to do unpleasant
    work or learn a non-career-advancing skill are more promising candidates for startups.
    Integrating with existing systems, especially legacy ones, is a nice example of
    work developers hate doing. Build your internal tool startup there. You can also
    bet that a full stack js dev would rather buy your Kafka wrapper than learn Scala,
    which will do nothing for her career prospects.

    more pressure to create value. As that happens, companies may stop naively believing
    engineers who say they can build what a vendor is offering in 2 weeks and still
    promote them after it took twice as long.
