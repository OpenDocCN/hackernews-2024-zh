- en: It’s an almost-inevitable part of any shopping trip. You enter a store to grab
    a few necessities and find yourself pushing, pulling, lifting and/or dragging
    your cart up the baking aisle as the one wheel with a mind of its own squeaks
    and stalls against the linoleum.

- en: A long-circulating urban myth holds that retailers deliberately make the carts
    unwieldy to slow your roll down the aisle, hoping to divert your attention to
    more merchandise. But the national frustration is not the work of a business psychology
    mastermind.

- en: The notoriously combative wheels are actually created by the repeated battering
    that shopping carts are often subject to, explained Alex Poulos. Poulos is the
    sales director for R.W. Rogers, which supplies thousands of shopping carts to
    companies like Whole Foods, Tractor Supply Company and Meijer.

- en: Grocery store carts are more likely to have carts with wonky wheels than other
    types of retailers, like clothing stores or drugstores, where the carts don’t
    leave the store as much; merchandise is typically carried out in a bag or two.
    That’s because they are exposed to the elements much more often, and that environmental
    damage affects the wheels. The primary culprit, however, is often not the wheel
    itself, but the way it’s attached to the cart.

    threshold of doorways in and out of the store, and forcing them up and down the
    curb warps the caster plate, the metal piece that attaches the wheel mechanism
    to the cart’s body, Poulos told CNN.

    and then both wheels are not touching the ground at the same time,” he said.

    the standard five-inch polyurethane shopping cart wheel could last between six
    and eight years, said Alvar Diaz, vice president of Sales and Marketing at wheel
    and caster manufacturing company P&H Casters. In a 24/7 store environment, they’re
    more likely to last two or three years, while the metal casters last for about
    five.

    bolts that keep everything together means that a new wheel can be just as wobbly
    as an older one.

    are at the mercy of extreme heat, snow, ice and road salt. That prolonged exposure
    can damage the cart and its wheels.

    coin locks on their carts. Customers insert a coin to “check out” a cart, which
    they get back when they return the cart to its original place at the end of their
    shopping trip.

    carts and fewer wobbly wheels.

    Poulos. “They ensure that the carts are maintained better and that (their) longevity
    is better because they’re not sitting in a snowbank or blown over by the wind.
    You also don’t need the labor to hunt them down and bring them back to the front
    of the store.”

    the typical polyurethane to pricier rubber.

    motorized cart in 1968.

    with mobility challenges. Therefore, these carts use rubber wheels with no casters
    or caster plates, meaning they can’t swivel or get stuck.

    like Walmart and Target have begun using rubber wheels in their carts.

    Diaz said P&H Casters’ natural rubber wheels can last for about a decade, barring
    mistreatment from customers. In a busier store environment, they can hold out
    between four and five years.

- en: However, many retailers choose cheaper parts because the upfront price is typically
    higher for more durable material, Poulos added. These companies end up needing
    to replace these parts more often as they get twisted and deformed, but these
    tasks — much like the carts — sometimes fall between the cracks.
