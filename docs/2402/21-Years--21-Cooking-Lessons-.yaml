    only learned to cook in earnest when I moved out of the house for my second year
    of college.

    toddler and have cooked for 70+ people on multiple occasions, had a falafel pop-up
    in LA, and so much more.

    thighs over breasts? Use thighs. Don’t let any recipe tell you what to put in

    cuts of meat (cut what you need and freeze the rest). Don’t follow recipes and
    make something based on what’s on sale (you were going to buy beef, but organic
    chicken is $1.99/lb, we’re makin’ a stew baby).

    get the immense benefit of cooking if you don’t use-up leftovers. Roast a chicken
    on Sunday→ becomes chicken soup on Monday → becomes a taco on Tuesday.
