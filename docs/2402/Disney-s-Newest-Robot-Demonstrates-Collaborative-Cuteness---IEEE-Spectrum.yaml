    the power of a great sidekick. Even though sidekicks aren’t the stars of the show,
    they provide life and energy and move the story along in important ways. It’s
    hard to imagine Aladdin without the Genie, or Peter Pan without Tinker Bell.

    proliferate. Even when multiple robots are used, they usually act in parallel.
    One key reason for this is that most robots are designed in ways that make direct
    collaboration with other robots difficult. Stiff, strong robots are more repeatable
    and easier to control, but those designs have very little forgiveness for the
    imperfections and mismatches that are inherent in coming into contact with another
    robot.

    open up some exciting opportunities, especially in the entertainment robotics
    space. At Walt Disney Imagineering, our research and development teams have been
    working on this idea of collaboration between robots, and we were able to show
    off the result of one such collaboration in Shanghai this week, when a little
    furry character interrupted the opening moments for the first-ever [*Zootopia*
    land](https://disneyparks.disney.go.com/blog/2023/10/zootopia-opening-dec-20-2023-at-shanghai-disney-resort/).

    rolled onstage at the Shanghai Disney Resort for the first time last December,
    pushing a purple kiosk and blasting pop music. As seen in the video below, the
    audience got a kick out of watching him hop up on top of the kiosk and try to
    negotiate with the Chairman of Disney Experiences, Josh D’Amaro, for a new job.
    And of course, some new perks. After a few moments of wheeling and dealing, Duke
    gets gently escorted offstage by team members Richard Landon and Louis Lambie.

    not by one robot, but by two. Duke Weaselton is the star of the show, but his
    dynamic motion wouldn’t be possible without the kiosk, which is its own independent,
    actuated robot. While these two robots are very different, by working together
    as one system, they’re able to do things that neither could do alone.

- en: The character and the kiosk bring two very different kinds of motion together,
    and create something more than the sum of their parts in the process. The character
    is an expressive, bipedal robot with an exaggerated, animated motion style. It
    looks fantastic, but it’s not optimized for robust, reliable locomotion. The kiosk,
    meanwhile, is a simple wheeled system that behaves in a highly predictable way.
    While that’s great for reliability, it means that by itself it’s not likely to
    surprise you. But when we combine these two robots, we get the best of both worlds.
    The character robot can bring a zany, unrestrained energy and excitement as it
    bounces up, over, and alongside the kiosk, while the kiosk itself ensures that
    both robots reliably get to wherever they are going.

- en: The collaboration between the two robots is enabled by designing them to be
    robust and flexible, and with motions that can tolerate a large amount of uncertainty
    while still delivering a compelling show. This is a direct result from lessons
    learned from an earlier robot, [one that tumbled across the stage at SXSW earlier
    this year](https://spectrum.ieee.org/disney-robot-indestructibles). Our basic
    insight is that a small, lightweight robot can be surprisingly tough, and that
    this toughness enables new levels of creative freedom in the design and execution
    of a show.

- en: 'This level of robustness also makes collaboration between robots easier. Because
    the character robot is tough and because there is some flexibility built into
    its motors and joints, small errors in placement and pose don’t create big problems
    like they might for a more conventional robot. The character can lean on the motorized
    kiosk to create the illusion that it is pushing it across the stage. The kiosk
    then uses a winch to hoist the character onto a platform, where electromagnets
    help stabilize its feet. Essentially, the kiosk is compensating for the fact that
    Duke himself can’t climb, and might be a little wobbly without having his feet
    secured. The overall result is a free-ranging bipedal robot that moves in a way
    that feels natural and engaging, but that doesn’t require especially complicated
    controls or highly precise mechanical design. Here’s a behind-the-scenes look
    at our development of these systems:'

- en: To program Duke’s motions, our team uses an animation pipeline that was originally
    developed for [the SXSW demo](https://spectrum.ieee.org/disney-robot-indestructibles),
    where a designer can pose the robot by hand to create new motions. We have since
    developed an interface which can also take motions from conventional animation
    software tools. Motions can then be adjusted to adapt to the real physical constraints
    of the robots, and that information can be sent back to the animation tool. As
    animations are developed, it’s critical to retain a tight synchronization between
    the kiosk and the character. The system is designed so that the motion of both
    robots is always coordinated, while simultaneously supporting the ability to flexibly
    animate individual robots–or individual parts of the robot, like the mouth and
    eyes.

    locomotion approaches. The GIFs below show some early attempts at riding a tricycle,
    skateboarding, and pushing a crate. In each case, the idea is for a robotic character
    to eventually collaborate with another robotic system that helps bring that character’s
    motions to life in a stable and repeatable way.

    R&D Imagineer Tony Dohi, who leads the project for us. “Ultimately, what we showed
    today is an important step towards a bigger vision. This project is laying the
    groundwork for robots that can interact with each other in surprising and emotionally
    satisfying ways. Today it’s a character and a kiosk, but moving forward we want
    to have multiple characters that can engage with each other and with our guests.”

- en: Walt Disney Imagineering R&D is exploring a multi-pronged development strategy
    for our robotic characters. Engaging character demonstrations like Duke Weasleton
    focus on quickly prototyping complete experiences using immediately accessible
    techniques. In parallel, our research group is developing new technologies and
    capabilities that become the building blocks for both elevating existing experiences,
    and designing and delivering completely new shows. The robotics team led by Moritz
    Bächer shared one such building block–embodied in a highly expressive and stylized
    robotic walking character–[at IROS in October](https://spectrum.ieee.org/disney-robot).
    The capabilities demonstrated there can eventually be used to help robots like
    Duke Weaselton perform more flexibly, more reliably, and more spectacularly.

    tools are the most valuable for us to develop,” explains Bächer. “In the end our
    goal is to create tools that enable our teams to produce and deliver these shows
    rapidly and efficiently.” This ties back to the fundamental technical idea behind
    the Duke Weaselton show moment–collaboration is key!
