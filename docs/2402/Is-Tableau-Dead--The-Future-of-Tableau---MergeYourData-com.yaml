    It would be like Michael Jordan bringing second year Lebron James onboard. Or

    approved and accessible by companies on the Microsoft stack. It's "free" to start
    with and in Microsoft's customers' stack, so business users and developers alike
    can build POCs with real company data they have access to.

    SaaS subscription costs and complexity after Covid made them run rampant. Microsoft
    already has relationships to nearly all of these large enterprise accounts of
    Tableau. And with the stickiness of Microsoft's products, they can take losses
    on Power BI to take Tableau market share (if they choose).

    view that it's for the more complex use cases and expensive. But once you reach

    as well. Similar to how Power BI is being adopted by companies who are already

    will not have the hope and excitement it had in the 2010s. Instead, they'll constantly
    voice frustration that no one in Salesforce cares about their customers and that
    they'll just be a line on a spreadsheet again. But it won't matter, because the
    Tableau revenue will continue to steadily grow as Salesforce digs its heels into
    current revenue streams.

    BI will eat some of that market share (you might've witnessed this at your compay

    of a standalone product.
