- en: Sets are collections of values where each value may only appear once. In the
    ES2015 version of the `Set`, the available functionality revolved around creating,
    adding to, removing from, and checking the membership of a `Set`. If you wanted
    to operate on or compare more than one set, you had to write your own functions.
    Thankfully, [TC39](https://tc39.es/ "TC39")—the committee established to work
    on the ECMAScript spec—and the browsers have been working on this. We are now
    seeing functions like `union`, `intersection` and `difference` in JavaScript implementations.
