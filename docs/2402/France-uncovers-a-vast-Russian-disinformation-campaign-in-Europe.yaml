    techniques at least since 2014, when it pioneered the use of bot farms to spread
    fake news about its invasion of Crimea. According to French authorities, the Kremlin
    is at it again. On February 12th Viginum, the French foreign-disinformation watchdog,
    announced it had detected preparations for a large disinformation campaign in
    France, Germany, Poland and other European countries, tied in part to the second
    anniversary of Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine and the elections to the European
    Parliament in June.

- en: Viginum said it had uncovered a Russian network of 193 websites which it codenames
    “Portal Kombat”. Most of these sites, such as topnews.uz.ua, were created years
    ago and many were left dormant. Over 50 of them, such as news-odessa.ru and pravda-en.com,
    have been created since 2022\. Current traffic to these sites, which exist in
    various languages including French, German, Polish and English, is low. But French
    authorities think they are ready to be activated aggressively as part of what
    one official calls a “massive” wave of Russian disinformation.
