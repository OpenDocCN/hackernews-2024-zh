- en: This is unrelated, but I thought [this article](/blog/using-org-mode-in-hugo/)
    would do well on Hacker News, since I am a long-time lurker and this article squarely
    fits in HN's interest zone. However, for some reason, it didn't.

- en: '**German Timezone:** All of a sudden, I started getting traffic from Germany.
    I was wondering what was happening; was the article shared on some German list?
    But the referrer was pointing to Hacker News. The mystery was solved when I tallied
    it with the German timezone-it was just Germans waking up! üòâ'

- en: '**Viewing habits:** Another interesting thing was that Hacker News users were
    laser-targeted on the article itself and didn''t explore other articles. This
    is different from other social media traffic where at least **20%** of the users
    explore other related links; it was less than **1%** in the case of Hacker News.'

- en: '**Web of HN:** Once an article gets featured on Hacker News, it is picked up
    by multiple sites that use Hacker News to filter quality posts. Some of them are
    country-specific; for example, I discovered [Dizkaz](https://dizkaz.com), which
    primarily serves Chinese readers. There are also alternate Hacker News readers
    like [Hckrnews](https://hckrnews.com) and specialized developer forums like [Daily
    dev](https://daily.dev). It was quite fascinating to discover these secondary
    sources.'

    another viewer with the PaleMoon browser. I''ll be careful about making assumptions
    about user''s operating systems and browsers from next time onwards.'
