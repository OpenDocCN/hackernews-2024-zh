    some of the biggest technological innovations in history. He lost his battle with
    pancreatic cancer in 2011, and would have been 69 years old today.

    and employees alike. But one of his most unwavering beliefs might surprise leaders
    who aspire to success as great as the [Apple](https://fortune.com/company/apple/)
    cofounder.

- en: When Jobs and Apple’s other cofounders, including Steve Wozniak, first realized
    how big their company would be, they decided to go out and hire what they called
    “professional management,” or folks who just knew how to manage people. But it
    quickly backfired.

    “Most of them were bozos. They knew how to manage, but they didn't know how to
    do anything.”

    should actually want to be managers or not. Jobs argued the people who were least
    expecting to be leaders ended up being the best managers in the long run. That’s
    because other employees were more likely to actually learn something from them
    because they’ve mastered that skill—rather than only focusing on management techniques.'

    who never ever want to be a manager, but decide they have to be a manager because
    no one else is going to be able to do as good a job as that,” Jobs said in the
    same interview.

    32 years old at the time he promoted her. She studied English literature in college,
    but earned her MBA from Stanford University and proved herself to be an exceptional
    financial manager.

    kind of operation,” Coleman said in a 1980s [interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQKis2Cfpeo).
    “I don't kid myself about that there's an incredible high risk—both for myself
    personally and professionally, and for Apple as a company—and put a person like
    myself in this job.”

    Coleman said. They were “betting that my skills and organizational effectiveness
    override” her lack of tech and manufacturing experience. Coleman went on to become
    chief financial officer of Apple and was referred to as one of Silicon Valley’s
    “most prominent technology executives.” She died in 2021.

    be] recruiting.”
