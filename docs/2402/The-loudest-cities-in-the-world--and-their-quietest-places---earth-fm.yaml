- en: Using academic and official sources, we began by reviewing data and research
    exploring noise levels in cities across the US, UK, and mainland Europe. Instead
    of absolute values showing how loud each city is, these sources explained what
    share of each city’s population is exposed to high noise levels during an average
    day.

- en: The results shown on this page are ordered by the percentage of the population
    experiencing [the day–evening–night noise level](https://g.co/kgs/wn3AQ4) (or
    Lden, a European standard for expressing noise levels over an entire day) of up
    to 65 dB. You’ll notice a huge disparity between the figures for US cities, compared
    to those in mainland Europe and the UK. That’s because of differences between
    how noise data is collected and measured, meaning that these regions should be
    considered separately.

    who visit them. We did this by searching visitors’ reviews for mentions of ‘quiet’,
    ‘relaxing’, ‘tranquil’, ‘calm’, and ‘peaceful’. This gave us a ‘Quiet Score’,
    a metric we created based on three factors: the share of each location’s reviews
    that mention these words; the location’s average visitor rating; and its popularity,
    and whether that impacts its peacefulness (a place with many reviews may be more
    crowded and less peaceful, while one with only a few reviews may not accurately
    represent the typical visitor experience). The higher the ‘Quiet Score’, the more
    peaceful the place is. In total, we looked into over 3,000 parks and nature spots
    across 245 cities.'

    results published here. We hope to expand this research to other world cities
    in the future. In the meantime, please [contact us](https://earth.fm/contact-us/)
