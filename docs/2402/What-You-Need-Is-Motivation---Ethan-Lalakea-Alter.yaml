    the Bauhaus couch you''ve tied me up on goes with the Hamadan rug in the entryway.

    theory came from the era where this was part of the deal, and I think people still
    seek the stability of large enterprises. Drucker is still widely cited (not just
    by me), his ideas are still widely influential, and he honed much of this thinking
    at GM in the 1940's, when paternalistic management and lifetime employment were
    still *de rigueur*. Of course, the corporation is no longer viewed as a caretaker
    or source of stability. Trillion dollar companies will not hesitate to jettison
    tenured employees in turbulent times.

    control the water in which we swam, the temperature, the direction of flow, the
    depth. Today, we’re sitting in inflatable kiddie pools in our living rooms (at
    least I am). To pretend that remote work as a norm should have no bearing on culture
    and the organization’s ability to motivate… to pretend as much would be willfully
    obtuse.

    their team’s needs better than any top-down cultural architect. Recall that when
    we talk about motivation in a corporate context, we're talking about the higher-order
    needs, the ones in the Strive and Thrive categories. In these upper tiers, humans
    display far more individual differences than at the lower tiers, and this is a

    you encounter. Strive and Thrive needs vary significantly from person to person.
