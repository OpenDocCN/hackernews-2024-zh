    fighting with and fixing up the the century old typesetting machine everyday in
    order to put out his family's paper week after week and year after year.

    usage among newspaper companies. The machine stayed situated as a prominent form
    of typesetting in the industry through the 1970's, before being supplanted by
    newer technology.

    open up and sun shines, that''s a real thing."'
