- en: In today's fast-paced AI landscape, developers face numerous challenges when
    it comes to building applications that use large language models (LLMs). In particular,
    the scarcity of GPUs, which are traditionally required for running LLMs, poses
    a significant hurdle. In this post, we introduce you to a novel solution that
    allows developers to harness the power of LLMs locally on CPU and memory, right
    within [Cloud Workstations](https://cloud.google.com/workstations), Google Cloud’s
    fully managed development environment. The models we use in this walkthrough are
    located on [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/) and are specifically in a repo
    from “The Bloke” and are compatible with the quantization method used to allow
    them to run on CPUs or low power GPUs. This innovative approach not only eliminates
    the need for GPUs but also opens up a world of possibilities for seamless and
    efficient application development. By using a combination of “quantized models,”
    Cloud Workstations, a new open-source tool named [localllm](https://github.com/googlecloudplatform/localllm),
    and generally available resources, you can develop AI-based applications on a
    well-equipped development workstation, leveraging existing processes and workflows.

    with limited computational resources. These models are designed to be more efficient
    in terms of memory usage and processing power, allowing them to run smoothly on
    devices such as smartphones, laptops, and other edge devices. In this case, we
    are running them on Cloud Workstations with ample available resources. Here are
    some great examples of why leveraging quantized models in your development loop
    may unblock your efforts:'

    using lower-precision data types such as 8-bit integers, instead of standard 32-bit
    floating-point numbers. This reduction in precision allows for faster computations
    and improved performance on devices with limited resources.'

    requirements of AI models. By representing weights and activations with fewer
    bits, the overall size of the model is reduced, making it easier to fit on devices
    with limited storage capacity.'

    due to their reduced precision and smaller model size. This enables faster inference
    times, allowing AI applications to run more smoothly and responsively on local

    of the flexibility, scalability and cost effectiveness of Cloud Workstations.
    Moreover, the traditional approach of relying on remote servers or cloud-based
    GPU instances for LLM-based application development can introduce latency, security
    concerns, and dependency on third-party services. A solution that lets you leverage
    LLMs locally, within your Cloud Workstations, without compromising performance,
    security, or control over your data, can have a lot of benefits.

    easy access to quantized models from HuggingFace through a command-line utility.
    `localllm` can be a game-changer for developers seeking to leverage LLMs without
    the constraints of GPU availability. This repository provides a comprehensive
    framework and tools to run LLMs locally on CPU and memory, right within the Google
    Cloud Workstation, using this method (though you can also run LLM models on your
    local machine or anywhere with sufficient CPU). By eliminating the dependency
    on GPUs, you can unlock the full potential of LLMs for your application development
    needs.
