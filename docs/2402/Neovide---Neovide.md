# Neovide - Neovide

> 来源：[https://neovide.dev](https://neovide.dev)

<main>

This is a simple, no-nonsense, cross-platform graphical user interface for [Neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim) (an aggressively refactored and updated Vim editor). Where possible there are some graphical improvements, but functionally it should act like the terminal UI.

If you're looking for the Neovide source code, that can be found [here](https://github.com/neovide/neovide). To search within the docs, you can simply press `s` or click the magnifying glass icon in the top left to bring up the search bar.

Installing through a package manager or building from source? [no problem!](installation.html)
