- en: The first time I tried out Virtual Reality was a while ago — somewhere in the
    late 1990's. I was quite young so my memory is a bit hazy, but I remember a research-lab-like
    room full of hardware, wires, and in the middle a large chair with a big helmet
    that came down over your head. I was put through some standard 3 minute demo where
    you look around, things move around you, they scare you by dropping you down,
    basics. The display was low-resolution, had strong ghosting artifacts, there was
    long response lag, and the whole thing was quite a terrible experience. I remember
    finally putting up the helmet and feeling simultaneously highly nauseated and…
    extremely excited. This was the future! I imagined the imminent miniaturization,
    rapid improvements in visual fidelity, VR arcades, holodecks!

    VR mentioned in tech headlines. No VR arcades sprung up across the street that
    I could visit with my friends. For the young me, VR became an embarrassing misprediction,
    right next to “obviously we’ll have flying cars/jetpacks soon”. Eventually, dreams
    of fantastical digital universes slipped from my mind entirely. Over time I realized
    that some technical advances are too easy to imagine, but too hard to execute,
    and VR falls into this category. I just had to patiently wait for its time to
    come.

    I impulsively reached for the “Back this project” button… but then realized I

    think this simple fact would be obvious common knowledge, but more than 50% of
    VR games still think that accelerating you around is okay. For example, the PlayStation

    a 2D view “glued” to your eyes, or the screen can flicker, or everything will
    briefly reverse along some axis, or the inputs to your eyes get switched, or the
    camera will rapidly spiral out, or something weird. These are extremely negative
    experiences that usually result in tearing your headset from your head and having
    to sit down for a while, or completely give up for the evening. VR headsets can
    also lose tracking in weird ways, which can cause the camera to either drift in
    some random direction or cause a jitter. In short, the cost of camera errors is
