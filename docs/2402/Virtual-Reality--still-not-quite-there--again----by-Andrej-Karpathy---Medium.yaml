- en: The first time I tried out Virtual Reality was a while ago — somewhere in the
    late 1990's. I was quite young so my memory is a bit hazy, but I remember a research-lab-like
    room full of hardware, wires, and in the middle a large chair with a big helmet
    that came down over your head. I was put through some standard 3 minute demo where
    you look around, things move around you, they scare you by dropping you down,
    basics. The display was low-resolution, had strong ghosting artifacts, there was
    long response lag, and the whole thing was quite a terrible experience. I remember
    finally putting up the helmet and feeling simultaneously highly nauseated and…
    extremely excited. This was the future! I imagined the imminent miniaturization,
    rapid improvements in visual fidelity, VR arcades, holodecks!

    VR mentioned in tech headlines. No VR arcades sprung up across the street that
    I could visit with my friends. For the young me, VR became an embarrassing misprediction,
    right next to “obviously we’ll have flying cars/jetpacks soon”. Eventually, dreams
    of fantastical digital universes slipped from my mind entirely. Over time I realized
    that some technical advances are too easy to imagine, but too hard to execute,
    and VR falls into this category. I just had to patiently wait for its time to
    come.

    I impulsively reached for the “Back this project” button… but then realized I
    forgot my Kickstarter password. That, and I was afraid this was vaporware. They
    promised a consumer version eventually and I had decided I can just wait for that.'

    many of them are “not too deep”. They are the $0.99 games for your phone, except
    on your face, and for $29.99\. I think I ended up spending several hundred dollars
    buying games for a total of maybe 10 hours of game time. There are many other
    games that are obviously lazily ported over from PC, in many cases resulting in
    terrible user experiences. Some of the games were so overpriced and under-cooked
    (with game-breaking bugs) that I ended up spending the time to file Steam complaints
    to get money back. Luckily, Steam is quite fast with this and promptly reimbursed
    the games. A VR consumer has to be careful out there.'

    ignore the new form factor and its constraints. For instance, you **cannot** translate
    or rotate (or worse, accelerate) the camera because it gives people nausea. You’d
    think this simple fact would be obvious common knowledge, but more than 50% of
    VR games still think that accelerating you around is okay. For example, the PlayStation
    VR Shark Encounter features a shark aggressively shaking your cage, except of
    course you don’t *feel it*. It’s wrong.'

    weird things to your field of view. Games can switch rapidly from a 3D view to
    a 2D view “glued” to your eyes, or the screen can flicker, or everything will
    briefly reverse along some axis, or the inputs to your eyes get switched, or the
    camera will rapidly spiral out, or something weird. These are extremely negative
    experiences that usually result in tearing your headset from your head and having
    to sit down for a while, or completely give up for the evening. VR headsets can
    also lose tracking in weird ways, which can cause the camera to either drift in
    some random direction or cause a jitter. In short, the cost of camera errors is
    extremely high.'

    deliver the complexity and repeatability. I’ve spent quite a bit of fun time in
    AltspaceVR: watching projected videos in the simulated living room, dancing with
    people, etc. I met a real-life friend in Altspace and we went for a walk and threw
