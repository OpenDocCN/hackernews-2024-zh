    hacker news that I want to plant a little firmer in the ground.

    advertising into my life. I think its wrong to let wealthy people have a shot
    at manipulating me. I trust the nytimes journalistic standards but not their advertising.

    youtube, and amazon prime) is to use the web. I know this is a minority position.
    And I know I have no recourse against Applications that are compiled into native
    apps and hosted by Apple. In Apples world they can get at me all they want.

    beliefs are not a priority. I'll need to compile and submit to live in their ecosystem;
    where apps are free to manipulate me; advertise at me.

- en: I have been loyal to Apple since my first purchase, a classic II, to use with
    Opcode's Studio Vision, it was a requirement for the class about computer music
    I was taking at Diablo Valley College in Pleasant Hill. I fell in love with Opcode.
    It was heaven with my Korg M1\. A personal universe opened up before me. A place
    all my own. I could make something here; all broken on my own.

    by Unix masters. I had a mac running Apple's Unix within a week of it's release.
    Damn the torpedos. Its that the input boxes worked with Emacs key bindings, that
    I could navigate natively just like I do when I code, a subtle attention to detail;
    an artistic promise to do excellence. I was in reliable hands; Apple was gonna
    do Unix right.

    telling me they are here to keep me safe. I accept that apple has only made me
    safe for others to manipulate. I left instagram, facebook, twitter, never even
    considered tiktok or snapshot. I will not be your victim.

    you. Fair enough.

- en: Who I do support is Europe. They are the noble warrior in this fight. They should
    go hard here. They should force Apple to suppot PWA cause it's PWA support or
    make a third party the arbiter of what spec shit Apple has to implement. Apple
    is turning an EU mandate into an excuse to grab more control.

  zh: 我支持的是欧洲。他们是这场战斗中的高贵战士。他们应该在这里强硬起来。他们应该迫使苹果支持 PWA，因为要么支持 PWA，要么让第三方成为规范的仲裁者来强制苹果实现这些狗屁规范。苹果正在把欧盟的命令变成一个控制的借口。
