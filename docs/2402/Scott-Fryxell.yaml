    hacker news that I want to plant a little firmer in the ground.

- en: I don't use the NYtimes app; though I pay for a subscription. I do not accept
    advertising into my life. I think its wrong to let wealthy people have a shot
    at manipulating me. I trust the nytimes journalistic standards but not their advertising.

    share so she knows what I mean. It's the best way I knew how to guarantee she'd
    understand. That's it.

    youtube, and amazon prime) is to use the web. I know this is a minority position.
    And I know I have no recourse against Applications that are compiled into native
    apps and hosted by Apple. In Apples world they can get at me all they want.

    is a legitimate revenue stream. Fuck you guys. Rich people telling poor people
    to ignore what benefits them is [gross](/blog/burning-through-our-daughters) to
    me.

    morality directly. I don't have to ask permission — I can enforce.

- en: This change Apple has made to PWAs in Europe has laid clear that my personal
    beliefs are not a priority. I'll need to compile and submit to live in their ecosystem;
    where apps are free to manipulate me; advertise at me.

- en: I have been loyal to Apple since my first purchase, a classic II, to use with
    Opcode's Studio Vision, it was a requirement for the class about computer music
    I was taking at Diablo Valley College in Pleasant Hill. I fell in love with Opcode.
    It was heaven with my Korg M1\. A personal universe opened up before me. A place
    all my own. I could make something here; all broken on my own.

- en: When OSX came out I was heavy into Emacs; working at Covalent and surrounded
    by Unix masters. I had a mac running Apple's Unix within a week of it's release.
    Damn the torpedos. Its that the input boxes worked with Emacs key bindings, that
    I could navigate natively just like I do when I code, a subtle attention to detail;
    an artistic promise to do excellence. I was in reliable hands; Apple was gonna
    do Unix right.

    That the web is a privelage. And you and I over here in 'merica had better be
    good boys or we're next.

- en: The choice is stark but clear – No more apple hardware, no more wealthy paternalism
    telling me they are here to keep me safe. I accept that apple has only made me
    safe for others to manipulate. I left instagram, facebook, twitter, never even
    considered tiktok or snapshot. I will not be your victim.

- en: I get to pick what goes into my eyes. PWA is the only guarantee I could find
    that can cut the mustard for the standards I want to live by. You don't get to
    point and be scared about it. You don't support me mother fucker I don't support
    you. Fair enough.

- en: Who I do support is Europe. They are the noble warrior in this fight. They should
    go hard here. They should force Apple to suppot PWA cause it's PWA support or
    make a third party the arbiter of what spec shit Apple has to implement. Apple
    is turning an EU mandate into an excuse to grab more control.
