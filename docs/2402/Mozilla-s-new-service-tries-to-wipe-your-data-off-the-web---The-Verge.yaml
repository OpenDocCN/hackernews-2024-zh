- en: Mozilla is introducing a new paid subscription privacy monitoring service called
    [Mozilla Monitor Plus](https://monitor.mozilla.org/). For $8.99 a month under
    its annual subscription, Mozilla says it will automatically keep a lookout for
    your information at over 190 sites where brokers sell information they’ve gathered
    from online sources like social media sites, apps, and browser trackers, and when
    your info is found, it will automatically try to get it removed.

- en: Mozilla Monitor product manager Tony Cinotto told *The Verge* in an email that
    Mozilla partners with a company [called Onerep](https://onerep.com/sites-we-remove-from)
    to perform these scans and subsequent takedown requests. While requests usually
    take between seven and 14 days to process, he says sometimes information can’t
    be removed. Mozilla will keep trying, he added, but will also give Plus members
    instructions for attempting removal themselves.

- en: Basic Monitor members will get a free scan and one-time removal sweep, plus
    continual monthly data broker scans afterward, Mozilla says. The paid subscription
    builds on the free dark web monitoring of Mozilla Monitor (previously Firefox
    Monitor), a service Mozilla [debuted in 2018](/2018/9/25/17899952/firefox-monitor-have-i-been-pwned-password-breach).
    Mozilla has offered other privacy-focused services in the last few years, such
    as Mozilla VPN and Firefox Relay.

    current and previous home addresses but adds that it could go as deep as criminal
    history, hobbies, or your kids school district.

- en: Services like this are fairly common, but they’re not all that well known to
    most people, and searching for them is as likely to turn up sketchy scam sites
    as it is legitimate service providers like, for instance, DeleteMe. That makes
    it difficult to suss out trustworthy companies, which is really where Mozilla’s
    reputation as a privacy-first subsidiary of the open-source nonprofit Mozilla
    Foundation could help.
