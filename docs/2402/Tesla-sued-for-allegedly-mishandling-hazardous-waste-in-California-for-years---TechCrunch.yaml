  zh: 特斯拉被加利福尼亚25个县起诉，指控该汽车制造商在全州设施中多次不当处理危险废物。诉讼是在看似数月的和解谈判破裂后提起的。
- en: The [complaint](https://www.scribd.com/document/702802223/Tesla-Complaint),
    filed in San Joaquin County Superior Court, states that Tesla improperly labeled
    and disposed of materials like “lead acid batteries and other batteries,” paints,
    brake fluid, aerosols, antifreeze, acetone, diesel fuel and more at its production
    and service facilities throughout the state. Tesla also allegedly improperly disposed
    of the waste, both on-site and at landfills that can’t accept hazardous waste.

    with the Securities and Exchange Commission that it was being investigated by
    district attorney offices from around the state of California over its waste management
    practices. The company said it “had implemented various remedial measures, including

    it was in settlement talks with those district attorney offices. The lawsuit suggests
    those talks ended without a resolution. Representatives for the San Francisco
    and San Joaquin District Attorney’s offices, which led the investigation, did
