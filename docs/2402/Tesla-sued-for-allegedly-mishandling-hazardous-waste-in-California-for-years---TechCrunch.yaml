    mishandled hazardous waste at facilities throughout the state. The lawsuit was
    filed after months of settlement talks apparently fell apart.

- en: The [complaint](https://www.scribd.com/document/702802223/Tesla-Complaint),
    filed in San Joaquin County Superior Court, states that Tesla improperly labeled
    and disposed of materials like “lead acid batteries and other batteries,” paints,
    brake fluid, aerosols, antifreeze, acetone, diesel fuel and more at its production
    and service facilities throughout the state. Tesla also allegedly improperly disposed
    of the waste, both on-site and at landfills that can’t accept hazardous waste.

- en: The district attorneys in each county are seeking an injunction to force Tesla
    to properly handle the waste at the facilities going forward as well as civil
    penalties. Tesla could be on the hook for as much as $70,000 per violation per
    day, [according to Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/tesla-sued-by-california-counties-over-hazardous-waste-2024-01-31/),
    which first reported the suit.

    with the Securities and Exchange Commission that it was being investigated by
    district attorney offices from around the state of California over its waste management
    practices. The company said it “had implemented various remedial measures, including
    conducting training and audits, and enhancements to its site waste management
    programs.”

    it was in settlement talks with those district attorney offices. The lawsuit suggests
    those talks ended without a resolution. Representatives for the San Francisco
    and San Joaquin District Attorney’s offices, which led the investigation, did
    not immediately answer a question about what happened to the settlement talks.

- en: Tesla has previously been scrutinized for the environmental impact of the work
    it does in California. The company [settled](https://www.epa.gov/archive/epa/newsreleases/us-epa-settles-tesla-over-hazardous-waste-violations-fremont-calif-facility.html)
    with the Environmental Protection Agency in 2019 over a number of violations at
    its Fremont, California factory, one of which included the labeling of hazardous
    waste. That resulted in a $31,000 fine and a $55,000 layout to cover the cost
    of emergency response equipment for first responders. Tesla also paid [a $275,000
    fine](https://techcrunch.com/2022/02/22/tesla-gets-wrist-slap-from-epa-for-violating-clean-air-act/)
    in 2022 for violating the Clean Air Act at the same factory.
