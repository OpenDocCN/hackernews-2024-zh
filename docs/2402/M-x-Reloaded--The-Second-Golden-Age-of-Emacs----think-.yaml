    were born and popularized on GitHub.

    much of passion for Emacs was coming from my passion for Lisps. Clojure gave me

    Emacs APIs, as macros like `if-let` and `thread-first` and libraries like `dash.el`

- en: Sadly many Emacs packages were a total mess a few years ago. Many maintainers
    would never cut releases and users were just expected to use the latest version
    of the code. This made the concept of a package repository that’s distributing
    only “tagged” releases problematic. Not to mention that `package.el` was very
    new and wasn’t popular enough to encourage people to change their ways. Do you
    remember that many Emacs packages weren’t using VCS and were distributed only
    on EmacsWiki? Fun times!

    and done” thing (unlike its predecessor Marmalade, when you had to upload each
    new release manually). You’d just submit a package recipe and MELPA will rebuild
    your package when needed.'

    of cool packages while browsing MELPA and I can’t imagine the Emacs community

    and refactoring capabilities of “modern” editors and IDEs. Its adoption of the
    industry standards LSP (Language Server Protocol) and TreeSitter changes this
    and makes sure Emacs developers don’t have to invest time solving problems that
    are already solved elsewhere. I’m guessing that in the long run this will allow
    the Emacs maintainers to focus more on the features that make Emacs unique and
    that’s a great thing in my book.
