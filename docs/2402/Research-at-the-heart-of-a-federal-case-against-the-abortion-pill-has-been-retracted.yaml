- en: A scientific paper that raised concerns about the safety of the abortion pill
    mifepristone was retracted by its publisher this week. The study was cited three
    times by a federal judge who ruled against mifepristone last spring. That case,
    which could limit access to mifepristone throughout the country, will soon be
    heard in the Supreme Court.

    in the month after having an abortion. The study found a much higher rate of complications
    than [similar studies](https://www.factcheck.org/2022/07/noems-misleading-claim-about-safety-of-medication-abortion/)
    that have examined abortion safety.

    two other papers, [explaining in a statement](https://perspectivesblog.sagepub.com/blog/note-from-sage-on-retractions-in-health-services-research-and-managerial-epidemiology)
    that "expert reviewers found that the studies demonstrate a lack of scientific
    rigor that invalidates or renders unreliable the authors' conclusions."

    Lozier Institute, the research arm of anti-abortion lobbying group Susan B. Anthony
    Pro-Life America, and that one of the original peer reviewers had also worked
    for the Lozier Institute.

    is targeting us because we have been successful for a long period of time," he
    says on a video [posted online this week](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DchuKOvfVJA).
    He asserts that the retraction has "nothing to do with real science and has everything
    to do with a political assassination of science."

    the one challenging the abortion pill, "we have become visible – people are quoting
    us. And for that reason, we are dangerous, and for that reason, they want to cancel
    our work," Studnicki says in the video.

- en: Anti-abortion rights groups, including a group of doctors, sued the federal
    Food and Drug Administration in 2022 over the approval of mifepristone, which
    is part of a two-drug regimen used in most medication abortions. The pill has
    been on the market for over 20 years, and is used in more than half abortions
    nationally. The FDA stands by its research that finds adverse events from mifepristone
    are extremely rare.

- en: Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk, the district court judge who initially ruled on the
    case, pointed to the now-retracted study to support the idea that the anti-abortion
    rights physicians suing the FDA had the right to do so. "The associations' members
    have standing because they allege adverse events from chemical abortion drugs
    can overwhelm the medical system and place 'enormous pressure and stress' on doctors
    during emergencies and complications," he wrote in his decision, citing Studnicki.
    He ruled that mifepristone should be pulled from the market nationwide, although
    his decision never took effect.

    says [Mary Ziegler](https://law.ucdavis.edu/people/mary-ziegler), a law professor
    and expert on the legal history of abortion at U.C. Davis. "There''s been so much
    polarization about what the reality of abortion is on the right that I''m not

    given its conservative majority. "We've already seen, when it comes to abortion,
    that the court has a propensity to look at the views of experts that support the
    results it wants," she says. The decision that overturned *Roe v. Wade* is an
    example, she says. "The majority [opinion] relied pretty much exclusively on scholars
    with some ties to pro-life activism and didn't really cite anybody else even or
    really even acknowledge that there was a majority scholarly position or even that
    there was meaningful disagreement on the subject."

    the argument about who has standing to sue, she explains. "There's a probability
    that people will take mifepristone and then there's a probability that they'll
    get complications and then there's a probability that they'll get treatment in
    the E.R. and then there's a probability that they'll encounter physicians with
    certain objections to mifepristone. So the question is, if this [retraction] knocks
    out one leg of the stool, does that somehow affect how the court is going to view
    standing? I imagine not."

    that this retraction probably won't sway the outcome either way. "If the court
    is skeptical of standing because of all these aforementioned weaknesses, this
    is just more fuel to that fire," she says. "It's not as if this were an airtight
    case for standing and this was a potentially game-changing development."

    safety of the abortion pill mifepristone. The research had been used in a court
    case about access to medication abortion. NPR's Selena Simmons-Duffin reports.
