    he found himself in the wrong place at the wrong time and wandered into one of
    the world’s greatest typewriter collections, in Figueres, Spain. It seemed almost
    as if his interest brought the technology history museum into existence for him.

    (website currently broken), and sparked in him the desire to write a full-length
    book about keyboards, from early typewriters to the present day.

    worked directly with a commercial lithographic offset printer on his own project.
    He wasn’t familiar with color screening or offset press technology. There were
    a long list of other “nevers,” too. He’s rarely daunted, and I’m an optimist —

    be required if he ran his own campaign — plus the uncertainty of having to hit
    goals to make it happen and bear personal financial risk for the outcome. Marcin
    told me that he also wondered if self-publishing might come off or feel to him
    like “failure.” He spent some time realistically exploring options to work with
    a publisher but never reached a point where he felt like it was the right fit.

    success of his viral tweets about the technology museum, [Marcin started a newsletter](https://newsletter.shifthappens.site/)
    on 29 August 2017\. (The Kickstarter campaign launched 5½ years later. Marcin
    said he thought he was launching the newsletter way too early, but a friend correctly
    advised him to.) Many creators of all sorts have lists with thousands — or even
    tens of thousands — of subscribers, letting them launch a project and hit targets
    quickly. I’d point as a solid example outside of crowdfunding to [Alexander Rose’s
    Spionage newsletter](https://alexanderrose.substack.com/). Rose has written many

    it: whether as catchy as *Shift Happens* or not, it should be something people
    identify with you and your project and, when they search on it, they find you
    first or very close to the top. Marcin discarded *Holy Shift* early on, and wisely
    so. (This is why *The Magazine’*s name was amusing when the primary method to

    That was all great — but he also went into communities. He went to keyboard meet-up
    events, participated in Reddit and other forums, and attended meetings or conventions
    of people to get a sense of what people were doing with typewriters and keyboards
    today. That fed into the book, which describes various communities quite well,

    preview, putting together image galleries, and programming games. This may be
    beyond a lot of people’s abilities or budgets, but the lesson is still solid:
    Marcin built a remarkable amount of anticipation for *Shift Happens*, the book,
    by putting up Shift Happens, the website, about a month before his Kickstarter
    launch. Even a modest site with lots of detail, a compelling story, and good photographic
    and other illustrations can draw people in. Marcin put a lot of himself into the
    site, too, so it didn’t feel like an impersonal technical account but an authentic
    journey of discovery. There’s a pre-internet adage that people have to hear about
    a book five times before they buy it; that isn’t true of books (or crowdfunding
    campaigns) today, but the more someone hears about a topic that might be of interest,

    campaign launched and another when the pre-order site was ready to accept fresh

    Somewhere between one and four is certainly ideal.)'
