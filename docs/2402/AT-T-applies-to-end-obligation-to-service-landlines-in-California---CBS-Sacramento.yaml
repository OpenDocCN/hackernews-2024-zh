- en: CAMPO SECO — AT&T doesn't want to be in charge of landlines anymore. If another
    company doesn't step up, this could mean the end of landlines as we know them.

    of California. The application is pending under the California Public Utilities
    Commission, but the end of a landline means the end of communication for some
    people.

    first time last year when her landline got disconnected, but she lives in a dead
    zone for cell phones. CBS13 had a hard time getting in touch with her because
    the call kept dropping.

    They said they can''t install it so I said let''s transfer the landline down there

    it back. AT&T doesn't want that obligation anymore.

    in California and to help the limited remaining landline consumers transition
    to modern, alternative services to replace their current outdated ones. All AT&T
    California customers will continue to receive their traditional landline services
    until an alternative service becomes available by AT&T or another provider."'
