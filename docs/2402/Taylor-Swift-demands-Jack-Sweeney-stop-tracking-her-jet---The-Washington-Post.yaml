- en: Jack Sweeney, a junior at the University of Central Florida, has for years run
    accounts that log the takeoffs and landings of planes and helicopters owned by
    hundreds of billionaires, politicians, Russian oligarchs and other public figures,
    along with estimates of their planet-warming emissions. The accounts use publicly
    available data from the Federal Aviation Administration and volunteer hobbyists
    who can track the aircraft via the signals they broadcast.
