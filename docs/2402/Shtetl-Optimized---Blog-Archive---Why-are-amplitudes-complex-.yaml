    of quaternionic Hermitian matrices need not be Hermitian.  In [this paper by McKague](https://arxiv.org/abs/0911.1761),
    you’ll read that the CHSH game is winnable with probability 1 in quaternionic
    QM, while in [this paper by Fernandez and Schneeberger](https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0307017),
    you’ll read that the non-commutativity of the quaternions introduces an order-dependence
    even for spacelike-separated operations.

    unless something clever is done to fix it, quaternionic QM allows superluminal
    signaling.  This is easy to demonstrate: suppose Alice holds a qubit in the state
    |1⟩, while Bob holds a qubit in the state |+⟩ (yes, this will work even for unentangled
    states!)  Also, let $$U=\left(\begin{array}[c]{cc}1 & 0\\0 & j\end{array}\right)
    ,~~~V=\left(\begin{array}[c]{cc}1 & 0\\0& i\end{array}\right).$$'

    V to his qubit, Bob will be left with the state $$ \frac{j \left|0\right\rangle

    example a [book by Adler](https://www.amazon.com/Quaternionic-Quantum-Mechanics-International-Monographs/dp/019506643X). 
    Would anyone who knows that literature be kind enough to enlighten us on how it
    proposes to escape the signaling problem?  Regardless of the answer, though, it
    seems worth knowing that the “naïve” version of quaternionic QM—i.e., the version
    that gets invoked in quantum information discussions like the ones I mentioned
    above—is just immediately blasted to smithereens by the signaling problem, without
    the need for any subtle considerations like the ones that differentiate real from
    complex QM.

    to email me with further details about his quaternionic QM proposal, and to allow
    me to [share them here](https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=4021#comment-1796606). Briefly,
    Adler completely agrees that quaternionic QM inevitably leads to superluminal
    signaling—but in his proposal, the surprising and nontrivial part is that quaternionic
    QM would reduce to standard, complex QM at large distances. In particular, the
    strength of a superluminal signal would fall off exponentially with distance,
    quickly becoming negligible beyond the Planck or grand unification scales. Despite
    this, Adler says that he eventually abandoned his proposal for quaternionic QM,
    since he was unable to make specific particle physics ideas work out (but the
    quaternionic QM proposal then influenced his later work).'
