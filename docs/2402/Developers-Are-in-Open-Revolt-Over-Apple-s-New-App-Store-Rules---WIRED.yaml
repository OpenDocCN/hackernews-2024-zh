- en: A battle for control is taking place inside iPhones across Europe. While Apple
    [introduced new rules](https://www.wired.com/story/apple-app-store-sideloading-europe-dma/)
    that ostensibly loosen its control over the App Store, local developers are seething
    at the new system, which they say entrenches the power Apple already wields over
    their businesses. They’re now breaking into a rare open revolt, mounting pressure
    on lawmakers to step in.

  zh: 一场关于控制权的战斗正在欧洲各地的iPhone内部进行。虽然苹果[引入了新规则](https://www.wired.com/story/apple-app-store-sideloading-europe-dma/)，表面上放松了对App
    Store的控制，但当地开发者对新系统愤怒不已，他们称这进一步巩固了苹果已经对他们业务拥有的权力。他们现在正在罕见地发起公开反叛，向立法者施压介入。
- en: So far, they have accused Apple’s new business terms of being “[abusive](https://proton.me/blog/apple-dma-compliance-plan-trap),”
    “[extortion](https://newsroom.spotify.com/2024-01-26/apples-proposed-changes-reject-the-goals-of-the-dma/),”
    and “[ludicrously punitive](https://twitter.com/dhh/status/1750669170411495710).”

  zh: 到目前为止，他们指责苹果的新商业条款为“[滥用行为](https://proton.me/blog/apple-dma-compliance-plan-trap)”、“[勒索行为](https://newsroom.spotify.com/2024-01-26/apples-proposed-changes-reject-the-goals-of-the-dma/)”和“[荒谬的惩罚](https://twitter.com/dhh/status/1750669170411495710)”。
- en: “Apple holds app providers ransom like the Mafia,” claims Matthias Pfau, CEO
    and cofounder of Tuta, an encrypted email provider. The tech giant treats iPhones
    as its territory, Pfau complains, tightly controlling developers’ access before
    taking a chunk of their profits. “Anyone wanting to provide an iOS app must pay
    a ransom to Apple; there’s no way around it.”

  zh: “苹果像黑手党一样勒索应用提供者，”加密电子邮件服务Tuta的首席执行官兼联合创始人马蒂亚斯·普法称。普法抱怨说，这家科技巨头把iPhone视为其领土，严密控制开发者的接入权，然后再收取他们利润的一部分。“任何想提供iOS应用的人都必须向苹果支付赎金，没有其他途径。”
- en: For years, Apple has rejected Tuta app updates if they include links to the
    company’s website, he says. Like all iOS apps, Tuta has also been unable to take
    in-app payments directly from its customers. Apple acts as an intermediary and
    charges a fee. Pfau was hoping the App Store reforms mandated by the [EU’s Digital
    Markets Act](https://www.wired.com/story/whatsapp-interoperability-messaging/)
    (DMA) would make companies like his less tightly bound to Apple. Instead, he is
    left disappointed by the new terms on offer. “What they came up with is the best
    proof that they are massively abusing their market dominance,” he says. “Apple
    is basically behaving like a dictator.”

  zh: 多年来，普法说，苹果拒绝了Tuta应用的更新，如果更新中包含指向公司网站的链接。像所有iOS应用一样，Tuta也无法直接从客户那里接受应用内支付。苹果充当中介并收取费用。普法希望欧盟数字市场法案（DMA）强制执行的App
    Store改革能够让像他这样的公司与苹果的联系更少。然而，他对提供的新条款感到失望。“他们所提出的证据最好证明他们正在大规模滥用其市场主导地位，”他说。“苹果基本上是在表现得像独裁者。”
- en: Apple was designated a “gatekeeper” under the DMA after the EU decided that
    the App Store acts as an important gateway between businesses and consumers. The
    company, along with other tech giants, has until March 7 to make a raft of changes.
    To avoid fines that can reach up to 20 percent of global revenue, the smartphone
    maker announced its new rules in late January.

  zh: 在欧盟决定App Store在企业和消费者之间充当重要门户后，苹果被指定为“门户守卫”。公司与其他科技巨头一道，必须在3月7日前进行一系列改革，以避免高达全球收入20%的罚款。这家智能手机制造商在一月下旬宣布了其新规则，以避免这些罚款。
- en: The rules technically make it possible for users of its hardware to download
    apps from alternative app stores and also for developers to use their own payment
    systems—bypassing Apple’s commission.

  zh: 技术上，新规定使得其硬件用户可以从另类应用商店下载应用，并允许开发者使用自己的支付系统，绕过苹果的佣金制度。
- en: But in order to access these new features, developers have to sign up to new
    business terms. Those terms include restrictions that disincentivize any developers
    moving away from the status quo, according to Pfau. If his company Tuta were to
    take advantage of the new system, iPhones would issue warnings—known by critics
    as “scare screens”—informing users about security risks linked to using payment
    systems that are not managed by Apple. From Tuta’s testing of how popups affect
    in-app upgrades, he estimates these warnings would dissuade 50 percent of users
    from proceeding with their purchase.

  zh: 但是，为了使用这些新功能，开发者必须同意新的商业条款。这些条款包括限制条件，阻碍任何开发者离开现状，据Pfau称。如果他的公司Tuta要利用新系统，iPhone将会发出警告——批评者称之为“恐吓屏幕”——告知用户使用非苹果管理的支付系统存在安全风险。根据Tuta对弹窗对应用内升级的影响测试，他估计这些警告会阻止50%的用户继续购买。
- en: Additionally, although the new terms allow Pfau to make Tuta available in an
    alternative app store, they would also expose the company to a “core technology
    fee” every time it was downloaded or updated more than 1 million times in a one-year
    period. Pfau accepts that Tuta, which he claims has over 100,000 paying subscribers,
    might not have to pay this fee in the first year. “But we are growing,” he insists.
    “So we would definitely have to pay it within the next couple of years.”

  zh: 此外，虽然新条款允许Pfau在另一应用商店中提供Tuta，但他们还要支付“核心技术费”，每年下载或更新超过100万次后就要支付一次。Pfau承认，Tuta目前拥有超过10万付费订阅用户，可能在第一年不需要支付此费用。“但我们在不断增长，”他坚称。“所以在接下来的几年内肯定会需要支付这笔费用。”
