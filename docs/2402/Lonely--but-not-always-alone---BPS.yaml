- en: Though they're often conflated, being alone doesn't necessarily mean feeling
    lonely. Sometimes time spent alone can feel nourishing and enjoyable, whereas
    at others, being around people can make us feel lonely and disconnected. The cliché
    of 'feeling alone in a crowd' is a cliché for a reason, and it illustrates the
    complex interplay between socialising and feeling alone.

    colleagues from the universities of Arizona, Wisconsin, and Indiana describe [their
    recent investigation](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jrp.2023.104426) into what actually
    leads us to feel lonely. To do this, the team pooled data from 426 (mainly female)
    adults who took part in three different studies:'

    measures of loneliness, depression, and anxiety both before and after an eight-week
    meditation intervention. They also wore an 'EAR' (an Electronically Activated
    Recorder) which allowed researchers to "examine patterns of social interaction,
    communication, environmental factors, and other relevant aspects of participants'
    lives." These devices were worn for two weekends, either side of the intervention.

    responses to divorce. Again, participants completed measures of loneliness, depression,
    and anxiety, and wore the EAR for six days.

    the same measures and wore an EAR for up to five consecutive days.

    spent around 65% of their waking hours alone. As you would expect, participants
    who were single were more likely to experience time without company than those
    in relationships, spending 8% more of their time by themselves. For single people,
    being older was also a significant predictor of time spent alone, while gender
    was not.

    to be lonely; in fact, older people were less likely to report feeling as such.
    Relationship status was actually a bigger predictor of loneliness overall, with
    single people feeling much lonelier than those in relationships after the age
    of 40\. Before this age, though, single people did not feel significantly more
    lonely than their partnered peers.

    could be because younger people "feel they have a greater potential to form new
    relationships in the future" compared to older people, who may already have experienced
    divorce or bereavement. Alternatively, being single be seen as more normal or
    socially acceptable for young people, whereas older people may find it more challenging
    to integrate with peers that begin to spend increasing amounts of time with their
    families in later life.

    time spent alone and loneliness were correlated, they were also "distinct and
    separable constructs." As you might expect, those who spent very little of their
    time with others reported high levels of loneliness — but, more unexpectedly,
    so did those who spent a lot of their time with others. Loneliness was particularly
    high in those who spent more than 75% of their waking hours with others, which
    could suggest that those who are particularly lonely may actively seek out time
    spent with others in order to ameliorate their lack of feeling connection.

- en: The team identified several limitations of this study. Firstly, none of the
    three studies that were drawn from are able to demonstrate causal links. Social
    activity gathered by the EAR was also not longitudinal, meaning that changes in
    social isolation were not tracked over time, which would give a more complete
    picture. Perhaps the most significant limitation is that the study also focused
    on the amount of social contact people had, rather than the content of those interactions.
    It would be informative to explore this aspect in more detail.

    interventions for loneliness. Often, these look towards increasing time spent
    with others — befriending schemes for older people, for example. However, this
    study drives home that people can feel lonely even when they're spending considerable
    amounts of time with others, likely meaning many in need of further support may
    be flying under the radar, experiencing loneliness not immediately apparent by
    current assumptions.
