- en: Though they're often conflated, being alone doesn't necessarily mean feeling
    lonely. Sometimes time spent alone can feel nourishing and enjoyable, whereas
    at others, being around people can make us feel lonely and disconnected. The cliché
    of 'feeling alone in a crowd' is a cliché for a reason, and it illustrates the
    complex interplay between socialising and feeling alone.

  zh: 尽管它们经常被混淆，独自一人并不一定意味着感到孤独。有时独处的时间可以让人感到滋养和愉快，而在其他时候，与人为伴可能会让我们感到孤独和断开联系。"在人群中感到孤独"这个陈词滥调之所以为人所知，正是因为它展示了社交与孤独感之间复杂的相互作用。

    colleagues from the universities of Arizona, Wisconsin, and Indiana describe [their
    recent investigation](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jrp.2023.104426) into what actually
    leads us to feel lonely. To do this, the team pooled data from 426 (mainly female)

  zh: 在《人格研究期刊》上发表文章的亚历山大·丹弗斯及其来自亚利桑那州、威斯康星州和印第安纳州大学的同事，描述了他们对导致我们感到孤独的真正原因进行的[最新调查](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jrp.2023.104426)。为了做到这一点，团队汇总了426名（主要为女性）成年人参与了三项不同的研究：
- en: The sample from the first study, which looked at meditation, completed self-report
    measures of loneliness, depression, and anxiety both before and after an eight-week
    meditation intervention. They also wore an 'EAR' (an Electronically Activated
    Recorder) which allowed researchers to "examine patterns of social interaction,
    communication, environmental factors, and other relevant aspects of participants'
    lives." These devices were worn for two weekends, either side of the intervention.

  zh: 来自第一项研究的样本，探讨了冥想，完成了关于孤独感、抑郁和焦虑的自我报告测量，以及一个为期八周的冥想干预前后的测量。他们还佩戴了一个“EAR”（电子激活录音器），允许研究人员“检查社交互动、沟通、环境因素和参与者生活中其他相关方面的模式”。这些设备在干预前后的两个周末佩戴。

    responses to divorce. Again, participants completed measures of loneliness, depression,
    and anxiety, and wore the EAR for six days.

  zh: 第三个和最后一个样本参与了一项关于老龄化的研究，完成了相同的测量并连续佩戴了五天的EAR。
- en: Looking at the EAR data across all samples, the team found that participants
    spent around 65% of their waking hours alone. As you would expect, participants
    who were single were more likely to experience time without company than those
    in relationships, spending 8% more of their time by themselves. For single people,
    being older was also a significant predictor of time spent alone, while gender
    was not.

  zh: 团队在分析所有样本的EAR数据时发现，参与者在清醒时大约有65%的时间是独自一人。正如你所预料的那样，单身者比恋爱中的人更可能独处，他们独自度过的时间比有伴侣的人多8%。对于单身者来说，年龄越大也是独处时间的一个重要预测因素，而性别则不是。
- en: However, this didn't mean that older participants in general were more likely
    to be lonely; in fact, older people were less likely to report feeling as such.
    Relationship status was actually a bigger predictor of loneliness overall, with
    single people feeling much lonelier than those in relationships after the age
    of 40\. Before this age, though, single people did not feel significantly more
    lonely than their partnered peers.

  zh: 然而，这并不意味着年长的参与者普遍更容易感到孤独；事实上，老年人更不太可能报告这种感觉。在总体上，情感状态的预测因子实际上是关系状态，单身者在40岁后感到的孤独远远超过那些有伴侣的人。在此年龄之前，单身者与他们的伴侣同龄人相比，并没有显著更多地感到孤独。
- en: The authors suggest that this interplay between age, relationships, and loneliness
    could be because younger people "feel they have a greater potential to form new
    relationships in the future" compared to older people, who may already have experienced
    divorce or bereavement. Alternatively, being single be seen as more normal or
    socially acceptable for young people, whereas older people may find it more challenging
    to integrate with peers that begin to spend increasing amounts of time with their
    families in later life.

  zh: 作者建议，这种年龄、关系和孤独之间的相互作用可能是因为年轻人“觉得自己未来有更大的可能性建立新的关系”，而与之相比，老年人可能已经经历了离婚或丧偶。或者，单身对于年轻人来说可能更加正常或社会接受，而对于老年人来说，可能更难融入那些在晚年开始花更多时间与家人在一起的同龄人中。
- en: The findings from the EAR portions of the studies also suggested that although
    time spent alone and loneliness were correlated, they were also "distinct and
    separable constructs." As you might expect, those who spent very little of their
    time with others reported high levels of loneliness — but, more unexpectedly,
    so did those who spent a lot of their time with others. Loneliness was particularly
    high in those who spent more than 75% of their waking hours with others, which
    could suggest that those who are particularly lonely may actively seek out time
    spent with others in order to ameliorate their lack of feeling connection.

  zh: 从研究的EAR部分得出的结果还表明，虽然独处时间和孤独感存在相关性，但它们也是“独立且可分离的构造”。正如你可能预期的那样，那些几乎不与他人交往的人报告了高水平的孤独感
    —— 但更令人意外的是，那些与他人交往时间很多的人也是如此。孤独感在那些与他人交往时间超过75%的人群中尤为严重，这可能表明，那些特别孤独的人可能会积极寻求与他人交往的时间，以缓解他们缺乏连接感的问题。
- en: The team identified several limitations of this study. Firstly, none of the
    three studies that were drawn from are able to demonstrate causal links. Social
    activity gathered by the EAR was also not longitudinal, meaning that changes in
    social isolation were not tracked over time, which would give a more complete
    picture. Perhaps the most significant limitation is that the study also focused
    on the amount of social contact people had, rather than the content of those interactions.
    It would be informative to explore this aspect in more detail.

  zh: 团队确定了这项研究的几个局限性。首先，这三项研究中没有一项能够展示因果关系。通过EAR收集的社会活动也不是纵向的，这意味着社会隔离的变化没有随时间进行跟踪，这将提供一个更完整的图片。也许最重要的局限性是，该研究还集中于人们的社交接触量，而不是这些互动的内容。深入探讨这一方面将会很有启发性。
- en: Even so, the results provide interesting data to reflect on when considering
    interventions for loneliness. Often, these look towards increasing time spent
    with others — befriending schemes for older people, for example. However, this
    study drives home that people can feel lonely even when they're spending considerable
    amounts of time with others, likely meaning many in need of further support may
    be flying under the radar, experiencing loneliness not immediately apparent by
    current assumptions.

  zh: 尽管如此，这些结果提供了有趣的数据，用于反思在考虑孤独干预时。通常，这些干预措施会试图增加与他人的交往时间 —— 例如为老年人设立的结交计划。然而，这项研究强调，即使与他人交往时间很多，人们仍可能感到孤独，这可能意味着许多需要进一步支持的人可能正处于低调状态，他们的孤独感并未被当前的假设所立即察觉。
