> 来源：[https://www.missile-game.com](https://www.missile-game.com)

This is a free game and not for commercial use. The concept of the game was from a flash game by Damien Clarke and was rewritten by Ben Mather with JavaScript in 2010 depending on Kevin Lindsey's SVG geometry library.

On top of the game, we support configuration and scoreboard to record the players' score around the world and private team.
