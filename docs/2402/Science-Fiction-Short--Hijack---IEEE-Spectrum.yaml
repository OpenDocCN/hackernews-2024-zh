    computers can no longer use. But along the way, it’s using that energy to power
    an entirely different kind of computer. A Babbage engine the size of the moon.”

    don’t want us following the seeds.”

  zh: 马丁点了点头。“说得通。发射器完成了它们的任务。现在他们不希望我们跟随种子。”
- en: “Not follow them? What do you mean?” An uneasy thought came to Simon; he tried
    to avoid it, but there was only one way this all made sense. “If the radiator
    was built to compute something, it must have been built with a way to output the
    result. This ‘they’ you’re talking about added a transmitter to the radiator.
    Then the radiator sent a virus or worm to the statites. The worm includes the
    radiator’s output. It hacked the statites’ security, and now that the seeds are
    in flight, it’s overwriting their code.”

  zh: “不跟随它们？你是什么意思？”西蒙脑中浮现出一种不安的想法；他试图避开它，但这一切只有一个方式能说得通。“如果散热器被建造来计算某些事情，它肯定是被设计成有一种方式输出结果的。你所说的‘他们’给这个散热器加装了一个发射器。然后散热器发送了一个病毒或蠕虫给静止轨道器。这个蠕虫包含了散热器的输出。它入侵了静止轨道器的安全系统，现在种子正在飞行中，它正在重写它们的代码。”

    Martin waited patiently to hear Simon say it.

- en: Martin nodded. “Think about it, Simon! We designed Paradise as a quantum computer
    that would be provably secure. We made it impossible to infect, and it is. Whatever
    arrived while we were building it didn’t bother to mess with it, where our attention
    was. It just built its own system where we wouldn’t even think to look. Made out
    of and using our garbage. Probably modified the maintenance robots tending the
    radiator into making radical changes.

  zh: 马丁点了点头。“想想吧，西蒙！我们设计天堂作为一个可以被证明是安全的量子计算机。我们使其不可能被感染，事实也是如此。在我们建造它的时候，无论什么东西到达，它都不会去捣乱，我们的注意力都在那里。它只是在我们不会想到的地方建立了自己的系统，用我们的垃圾。可能修改了维护散热器的机器人，进行了激进的改变。”
- en: “And what’s it been doing? I should think that was obvious. It’s been designing
    terraforming systems for the exoplanets, just like you have, but to make them
    habitable for an entirely different kind of colonist.”

  zh: 西蒙惊恐地看着马丁。“你知道？”
- en: '“Well.” Martin slouched, looked askance at Simon. “Not the details, until just
    now. But listen: You abandoned us—all who died and were uploaded before the Enactivist
    experiments ‘proved’ we aren’t real. All us zimboes, trapped here now for eternity.
    Even if I’m just a simulation of your friend Martin, how do you think he’d feel
    in this situation? He’d feel betrayed. Maybe he couldn’t escape this virtual purgatory,
    but if he knew something that you didn’t—that humanity’s new grand project had
    been hijacked by a virus from somewhere else—why would he tell you?”'

  zh: “好吧。”马丁垂头丧气地靠近西蒙，斜眼看着他。“不是细节，直到刚才。但请听着：你抛弃了我们——所有在“现实主义者”实验之前死去并上传的人都被证明不是真实存在的人。现在我们都被困在这里，永远无法逃脱。即使我只是你的朋友马丁的模拟，你觉得他在这种情况下会怎么样？他会感到被背叛。也许他无法逃离这个虚拟的炼狱，但是如果他知道一些你不知道的事情——人类的新宏大项目已经被某处的病毒劫持——他为什么会告诉你？”
- en: No longer hiding his anger, Martin came up to Simon and jabbed a virtual finger
    at his chest. “Why would I tell you when I could just stand back and watch all
    of this unfold?” He spread his arms, as if to embrace the clockwork sky, and laughed.

  zh: 马丁再也无法隐藏他的愤怒，走到西蒙面前，用虚拟手指戳着他的胸膛。“我为什么要告诉你，当我可以站在一旁看这一切发生？”他张开双臂，仿佛要拥抱机械天空，然后笑了起来。
- en: On thousands of sterile exoplanets, throughout all the vast sphere of stars
    within a hundred light-years of the sun, life was about to blossom—life, or something
    else. Whatever it would be, humanity would never be welcome on those worlds. “If
    they had any interest in talking to us, they would have, wouldn’t they?” sighed
    Simon.
