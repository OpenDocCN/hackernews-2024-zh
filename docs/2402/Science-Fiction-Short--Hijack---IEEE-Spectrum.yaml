    as he sat down next to Simon. “Considering that you don’t believe I exist.”

- en: “Ah. They sent you to acknowledge the Uploaded, is that it?” Martin turned his
    long, sad-eyed face to the sky and the drama playing out above. **A** The Heaven
    runtime was a fully virtual world, so Simon had converted the sky into a vast
    screen on which to project what was happening in the real world. The magnified
    surface of the sun made a curving arc from horizon to horizon. Jets and coronas
    rippled over it, and high, high above its incandescent surface hung thousands
    of solar statites shaped like mirrored flowers **B**.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: They did not orbit, instead floating over a particular spot by light pressure
    alone. They formed a diffuse cloud, dwindling to invisibility before reaching
    the horizon. This telescope view showed the closest statite cores scattering fiery
    specks like spores into the overwhelming light. The specks blazed with light and
    shot away from the sun, accelerating.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This moment was the pinnacle of Simon’s career, the apex of his life’s work.
    Each of those specks was a solar sail **C**, kilometers wide, carrying a terraforming
    package **D**. Launched so close to the sun and supplemented with lasers powered
    by the statites, they would be traveling at 20 percent light speed by the time
    they left the solar system. At their destinations, they’d sundive and then deliver
    terraforming seeds to lifeless planets around the nearest stars.

    a speech he’d written and rehearsed long ago. He’d dreamed of saying them on a
    podium, with Martin standing with him. But Martin...well, Martin had been dead
    for 20 years now.

    he was absolutely alone.

    And then what? An orderly shutdown of the Heaven runtime? Sell off the Paradise
    processor as scrap?”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “I knew this was a bad idea.” Simon raised his hand to exit the virtual world,
    but Martin quickly stood, looking sorry.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    to unite humanity. Our triumph over death! Why did you let them hijack it for
    this?”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Simon watched the spores catch the light and flash away into interstellar space.
    “You know we won’t shut you down. Heaven will be kept running as long as Paradise
    exists. We built it together, Martin, and I’m proud of what we did.”

    millions of people believed that in dismantling Mercury **E** and turning it into
    a sun-powered **F** quantum computer **G** there would be enough computing power
    for every living person to upload their consciousness into it. The goal had been
    to achieve eternal life in a virtual afterlife: the Heaven runtime.'

    happened, Martin. How were we to know Enactivism **H** would answer the ‘hard
    problem’ of consciousness? You and I had barely even heard of extended consciousness
    when we proposed Heaven. It was an old idea from cognitive science. Nobody was
    even studying it anymore except a few AIs, and we were sucking up all the resources
    they might have used to experiment.” He glanced ruefully at Martin. “We were all
    blindsided when they proved it. Consciousness can’t be just abstracted from a
    brain.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Martin’s response was quick; this was an old argument between them. “Nothing’s
    ever completely proven in science! There’s always room for doubt—but *you* agreed
    with those AIs when they said that simulated consciousness can’t have subjective
    experiences. Conveniently after I died but before I got rebooted here. I wasn’t
    here to fight you.”

    of the old Martin so accurate that I act exactly how he would if you told him
    he wasn’t self-aware. I deny it! Of course I do, like everyone else from that
    first wave of uploads.” He gestured, and throughout the simulated mountain valley,
    thousands of other human figures were briefly highlighted. “But what did it matter
    what I said, once I was in here? You’d already repurposed Paradise from humanity’s
    chance at immortality to just a simulator, using it to mimic billions of years
    of evolution on alien planets. All for this ridiculous scheme to plant ready-made,
    complete biospheres on them in advance of human colonization.” **J**'

    only way we could justify that after the Enactivism results was to find an even
    higher purpose than you and I started out with.

    this subsystem running our original Heaven sim, because you’re right—there’s always
    a chance that the Enactivists are wrong. However slim.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    your Enactivist rebellion. If I didn’t know better, I’d call this project”—he
    nodded at the sky—“the weirdest thing of all. Things are about to heat up now,
    though, aren’t they?”
  prefs: []

    the simulated Martin rage in his artificial heaven; the science was unequivocal.
    In truth, Simon had been speaking only to himself for the entire conversation.

    closer to the sun than Mercury had. Self-reproducing machines had eaten that planet
    in a matter of decades, transforming its usable elements into a solar-powered
    quantum computer tens of thousands of kilometers across. The bowl cupped a spherical
    cloud of iron that acted as a radiator for the waste heat emitted by Paradise’s
    quadrillions of computing modules. **K**

    made life the most precious thing in the universe, and spreading it throughout
    the galaxy seemed a better ambition for humanity than building a false heaven.

- en: Simon had reluctantly come to accept this. Martin was right, though. Things
    *had* gotten weird. Paradise was such a good simulator that you could ask it to
    devise a machine to do *X*, and it would *evolve* its design in seconds. Solutions
    found through diffusion and selection were superior to algorithmically or human-designed
    ones, but it was rare that they could be reverse-engineered or their working principles
    even understood. And Paradise had computing power to spare, so in recent years,
    human and AI designers across the solar system had been idled as Paradise replaced
    their function. This, it was said, was the Technological Maximum; it was impossible
    for any civilization to attain a level of technological advancement beyond the
    point where any possible system could be instantly evolved.

    dark azure sky. The vast sweep of the ring rose before and behind; in its center,
    a vast canted mirror reflected sunlight; to the left of that, he could see the
    milky white surface of the Paradise bowl. Usually, to the right, there was only
    blackness.

    heat from the calculation of all those alien ecosystems. Except...

    was still there, gazing at the sky.

    packages were completed and copied to the sails—most of them years ago. Now they’re
    on their way, Paradise doesn’t have any duties, except maybe evolving better luxury
    yachts.”

    Martin would be enjoying it, if he were here.
  prefs: []

    Martin said. “Each one was unique; each grown for one owner, one purpose, one
    place. You said they looked alien, and I laughed and said, ‘How would we even
    know if an alien invasion was happening, if no two things look or work the same
    anymore?’ ”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    building an artificial heaven by dismantling Mercury…” But Martin wasn’t laughing
    at his feeble joke. He was shaking his head.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    to monitor the construction of Paradise noticed just how many objects pass through
    the solar system every year.”

    yourself that rocks from other star systems must pass through ours all the time.”

    building Paradise, several objects drifted from interstellar space into one side
    of the Paradise construction orbits...and didn’t come out the other side.”

    the spherical iron cloud in the bowl of Paradise. “Remember why we even have a
    radiator?”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    it can’t be used for further calculations down the line, it’s literally meaningless,
    it has to be discarded.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “Right. We designed Paradise in layers, so each layer would scavenge the waste
    from the previous one—optical computing on the sunward-facing skin, electronics
    further in. But inevitably, we ran out of architectures that could scavenge the
    excess. There is *always* an excess that is meaningless to the computing architecture
    at some point. So we built Paradise in the shape of a bowl, where all that extra
    heat would be absorbed by the iron cloud in its center. We couldn’t use that iron
    for transistors. The leftovers of Mercury were mostly a junk pile—but one we could
    use as a radiator.”

    Simon.

    Whatever telescope he was linked to zoomed crazily; it felt like the whole world
    was getting yanked into the radiator. Simon was used to virtual worlds, so he
    just planted his feet and let the dizzying motion wash over him.

    Simon began to see structure to it: giant cells far brighter than the material

    out of Martin’s virtual garden and into a confused roar inside the stadium.

    statite launchers hovering over the sun. One by one, they were folding in on themselves,
    falling silently into the incinerating heat below. The crowd was on its feet,
    people shouting in shock and fear. Now that the launchers had sent the terraforming
    systems, they were supposed to propel ships of colonists heading for the newly
    greened worlds. There were no more inner-solar-system resources left to build
    more.

    at the intricate depths of the red-hot radiator that filled the sky. Simon followed
    his gaze and saw...
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “Gears?” The radiator was a cloud, but only now was it revealing itself to be
    a cloud of clockwork elements that, when thermal energy brought them together,
    spontaneously assembled into more complex arrangements. And those were spinning
    and meshing in an intricate dance that stretched away into amber depths in all
    directions. **O**
  prefs: []

    computers can no longer use. But along the way, it’s using that energy to power
    an entirely different kind of computer. A Babbage engine the size of the moon.”

    don’t want us following the seeds.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “Not follow them? What do you mean?” An uneasy thought came to Simon; he tried
    to avoid it, but there was only one way this all made sense. “If the radiator
    was built to compute something, it must have been built with a way to output the
    result. This ‘they’ you’re talking about added a transmitter to the radiator.
    Then the radiator sent a virus or worm to the statites. The worm includes the
    radiator’s output. It hacked the statites’ security, and now that the seeds are
    in flight, it’s overwriting their code.”

    Martin waited patiently to hear Simon say it.

  prefs: []

    that would be provably secure. We made it impossible to infect, and it is. Whatever
    arrived while we were building it didn’t bother to mess with it, where our attention
    was. It just built its own system where we wouldn’t even think to look. Made out
    of and using our garbage. Probably modified the maintenance robots tending the
    radiator into making radical changes.
