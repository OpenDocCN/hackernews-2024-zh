    phenomenon characterized by short-term memory loss when passing through a doorway
    or moving from one location to another.^([[1]](#cite_note-forgetting-1)) We tend
    to forget items of recent significance immediately after crossing a boundary^([[2]](#cite_note-multimodal-2))
    and often forget what we were thinking about or planning on doing upon entering
    a different room.^([[3]](#cite_note-3)) Research suggests that this phenomenon
    occurs both at literal boundaries (e.g., moving from one room to another via a
    door) and metaphorical boundaries (e.g., imagining traversing a doorway, or even
    when moving from one desktop window to another on a computer).^([[2]](#cite_note-multimodal-2))

    performed the first experiments that demonstrated that successful recall of objects
    became less accessible with a spatial shift and dissociation from the person.
    This was measured by the moving of associated or dissociated objects through virtual
    rooms.^([[12]](#cite_note-Situation-12)) Radvansky and Copeland had participants
    engage with short narratives where objects were either associated or dissociated
    from the participant. For example, a person might wear a sweatshirt (associated),
    take it off (dissociated), and go for a run. The researchers measured explicit
    factors like memory probes and comprehension, as well as implicit factors like
    reading times. The results showed that information about an object became less
    available when it was dissociated from the person, compared to when it was associated.
    These patterns aligned with previous research demonstrating how spatial shifts
    disrupt cognitive processing. However, it remained unclear to what extent the
    observed spatial effect was due to the association/dissociation of objects with
    the participant or the actual spatial change. Hence, Radvansky and Copeland aimed
    to separate and study these two components independently. To achieve this, they
    introduced rooms of varying sizes that virtually eliminated walls and doorways
    while maintaining consistent distance. This allowed them to assess the individual
    impacts of object association/dissociation and spatial shifts. Their conclusion
    was twofold: the effect related to object association/dissociation persisted,
    and there was clear evidence that moving through a doorway made highly available
    information less accessible. ***Experiment 1*** aimed to investigate if information
    availability about objects changed based on their association/dissociation with
    a person after spatial shifts. The **Standard Associated/Dissociated Effect**
    refers to the impact of relationships between objects and individuals within a
    dynamic situation in text comprehension. In simpler terms, how people react or
    feel when reading a story changes based on the relationships and changes over
    time. The researchers wanted to see if the patterns seen in text comprehension
    studies would apply in a virtual reality context, as predicted by situation model
    theory. Alternatively, traditional memory models might predict that spatial changes
    wouldn''t affect memory. The results of Experiment 1 demonstrated that after spatial
    shifts, participants responded more accurately and quickly when objects remained
    associated with a person rather than being dissociated. This indicated that people
    actively monitor the spatial and relational aspects of a situation, affecting
    how information is stored in memory. This finding challenged memory theories that
    ignored environmental interactions. Even explicit rehearsal of object names experienced
    disruption. Thus, memory involves active interaction with context. While the effect
    was clear, it was uncertain what caused it—whether participants monitored what
    they carried or the spatial shift itself.'

    the need to update our mental representation when transitioning to a new room.
    This updating process demands cognitive effort and coordination, affecting processing
    and leading to errors. While more research is needed, this study sheds light on

- en: Implications of physical environment with memory extend its role in eliciting
    revealed behaviours including notions of cognitive [empathy gaps](/wiki/Empathy_gap
    "Empathy gap"), which are underlined by deviations in mentalising processes of
    one's emotive states.^([[14]](#cite_note-14)) Examples of how broader contributions
    to the relations between environment, memory, and behaviour were demonstrated
    by London-based behavioural consultancy, Cowry Consulting's "Preventing falls
    with pink walls" project that aimed to reduce unsafe behaviour at construction
    sites. Changes to the physical environment were made by painting break room walls
    [Baker-Miller pink](/wiki/Baker-Miller_pink "Baker-Miller pink"), restructuring
    with plants, softer lighting, and communal tables to differentially segment the
    space were seen "to reduce anxiety, stress and aggression".^([[15]](#cite_note-15))
