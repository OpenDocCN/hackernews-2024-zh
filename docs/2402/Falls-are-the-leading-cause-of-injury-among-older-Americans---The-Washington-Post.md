# Falls are the leading cause of injury among older Americans - The Washington Post

> 来源：[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2024/02/19/falls-aging-brain-hip-fractures/](https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2024/02/19/falls-aging-brain-hip-fractures/)

About 1 in 4 U.S. adults 65 and older — more than 14 million people — suffer a fall each year, [according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://www.cdc.gov/falls/facts.html).

Falls are the leading cause of injury among those 65 and older, even though not all falls result in an injury, the CDC says. [About 37 percent](https://www.cdc.gov/falls/data/index.html) of older people who have fallen have sustained an injury that required medical treatment or activity restrictions. For instance, the CDC reports that 95 percent of hip fractures result from a fall, and falls also are the most common cause of traumatic brain injuries.
