    blamed Mr Bean actor Rowan Atkinson as the central influence against electrification,
    at least in the UK. That might be a bit farfetched, but there has been an obvious
    increase in journalism and social media negativity aimed at EVs. When you step
    back and look at history you realize that we could have gone electric 25 years
    ago, but concerted industrial forces killed the trend. Are we seeing another attempt
    to ruin the latest EV revolution, and will it succeed?

    This may have started out with just 55 miles of EPA range with the original lead-acid
    battery, but the final NiMH version boosted this to 105 miles (and the original
    EPA estimates were higher). Toyota had an EV version of the RAV4 and Honda had
    the EV Plus. But then all three companies pulled their vehicles and wouldn’t even
    let existing owners keep them. This unedifying piece of history is well documented
    in the film *Who Killed The Electric Car?* from 2006.

    profits, and the current situation doesn’t seem to be that different. While both
    EVs and internal combustion engine (ICE) cars need energy to drive, the companies
    supplying that energy and the infrastructure they use are different between the
    two. Your home power company, or the grid supplier for public charging, is not
    an oil company (although both Shell and BP own charging networks in the UK). EVs
    also entail a shift away from fuel station forecourts towards street and home
    chargers, changing both the business model and the car refueling method we have
    been familiar with for a century.

- en: Charging infrastructure remains a problem deterring many drivers from buying
    EVs, and that’s a valid concern if you don’t have the possibility of accessing
    a home charger. The considerable cost benefit of cheap overnight electricity makes
    the economics of EV ownership very much factored on this. If you don’t have home
    charging, driving an EV is much more expensive. Since the energy crisis, public
    charging costs have taken the price per mile of an EV much closer to fossil fuel.
    However, the market of those who can get home charging is still huge – it could
    be over half the UK population, for example. That’s a group that is far from saturated
    so far.

    EVs again, presented as proof that interest in EVs is waning. Ford is reducing
    production of F-150 Lightning EVs while increasing output of the Bronco SUV and
    Range pickup, and last year VW paused production of some of its EVs due to weak
    demand. Some who are clearly not very competent at mathematics have also equated
    a fall in the rate of growth as demand going backwards, when in fact it’s more
    like lower acceleration than putting the brakes on. The EV market is still expanding.

    I’m confident that the company is merely hedging its bets in an entirely sensible
    fashion. There may be parts of the world where the rapid fueling possibility of
    FCEVs and gasoline-like distribution infrastructure are preferable to BEVs, so
    BMW wants to explore that and be ready just in case. But most of its energy is
    going into BEVs, which are clearly going to be the mass market winners in the
