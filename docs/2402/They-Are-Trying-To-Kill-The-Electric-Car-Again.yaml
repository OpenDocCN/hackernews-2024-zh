    blamed Mr Bean actor Rowan Atkinson as the central influence against electrification,
    at least in the UK. That might be a bit farfetched, but there has been an obvious
    increase in journalism and social media negativity aimed at EVs. When you step
    back and look at history you realize that we could have gone electric 25 years
    ago, but concerted industrial forces killed the trend. Are we seeing another attempt
    to ruin the latest EV revolution, and will it succeed?

- en: Twenty-five years ago, the EV1 from General Motors showed incredible promise.
    This may have started out with just 55 miles of EPA range with the original lead-acid
    battery, but the final NiMH version boosted this to 105 miles (and the original
    EPA estimates were higher). Toyota had an EV version of the RAV4 and Honda had
    the EV Plus. But then all three companies pulled their vehicles and wouldn’t even
    let existing owners keep them. This unedifying piece of history is well documented
    in the film *Who Killed The Electric Car?* from 2006.

    profits, and the current situation doesn’t seem to be that different. While both
    EVs and internal combustion engine (ICE) cars need energy to drive, the companies
    supplying that energy and the infrastructure they use are different between the
    two. Your home power company, or the grid supplier for public charging, is not
    an oil company (although both Shell and BP own charging networks in the UK). EVs
    also entail a shift away from fuel station forecourts towards street and home
    chargers, changing both the business model and the car refueling method we have
    been familiar with for a century.

    EVs, and that’s a valid concern if you don’t have the possibility of accessing
    a home charger. The considerable cost benefit of cheap overnight electricity makes
    the economics of EV ownership very much factored on this. If you don’t have home
    charging, driving an EV is much more expensive. Since the energy crisis, public
    charging costs have taken the price per mile of an EV much closer to fossil fuel.
    However, the market of those who can get home charging is still huge – it could
    be over half the UK population, for example. That’s a group that is far from saturated
    so far.

    EVs again, presented as proof that interest in EVs is waning. Ford is reducing
    production of F-150 Lightning EVs while increasing output of the Bronco SUV and
    Range pickup, and last year VW paused production of some of its EVs due to weak
    demand. Some who are clearly not very competent at mathematics have also equated
    a fall in the rate of growth as demand going backwards, when in fact it’s more
    like lower acceleration than putting the brakes on. The EV market is still expanding.

    "https://www.whichev.net/2024/02/07/uk-achieves-1-million-ev-registrations-milestone/")

    "https://allaboutevs.info/news/tesla-model-y-cruises-to-top-spot-dethroning-toyota-in-2023-global-sales/"),
    surpassing both the Toyota RAV and Corolla. Only some manufacturers are facing
    issues, and this could be due to the price of the EVs they sell. Most automakers
    continue to target the premium market, presumably to earn back the development
    cost of their drivetrain innovation more quickly than would be possible with cars
    that elicit lower margins.

    was before the effects of Covid, the war in Ukraine, the cost of energy crisis,
    and supply chain issues caused by the Houthi blockade of Red Sea container ship
    routes. Nevertheless, CATL is still expecting to halve the per-kWh price of its
    Lithium Iron Phosphate (LFP) batteries this year, and these are the chemistry

    have concentrated on the premium market of early adopters has left them vulnerable.
    Chinese manufacturers like MG haven’t been so reluctant to address affordability,
    and there are other brands from China waiting in the wings to steal market share,
    such as BYD, just like Japanese carmakers did in the 1970s and 80s. While traditional
    European and US car companies might see EVs as a threat, the Chinese ones see
    them as an opportunity to get a bigger foothold in Western markets.

- en: You can spot a renewed campaign against BEVs when there is a resurgence of talk
    about hydrogen fuel cells. Multiple articles and social posts have been circulating
    claiming that BMW is “saying goodbye to electric because it has solved the problem
    of hydrogen engines”, based seemingly on the fact that [BMW launched a prototype
    fuel cell-powered iX5 SUV about a year ago](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jamesmorris/2023/02/27/bmw-ix5-hydrogen-first-drive-the-car-h2-has-been-waiting-for/?sh=6fc64c356b12

    But that needs to be weighed against the much bigger effort it is making towards
    BEVs, such as the [forthcoming Neue Klasse](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jamesmorris/2023/09/02/bmw-gives-biggest-preview-yet-of-neue-klasse-electric-future-at-iaa-mobility/?sh=48d7b4ff6eef

    of the early 1980s, with EVs in the Betamax role (because they are technically
    better?) and FCEVs as VHS. But there were 2.4 million BEVs in the USA in November
    2023, against fewer than 18,000 FCEVs. The UK’s 1 million BEVs compares to fewer
    than 400 FCEVs. Shell has shut all its hydrogen fuel stations globally, and on
    a recent check there appeared to be just four working H2 pumps in the whole UK,
    including the one in Aberdeen with “no live status information”. There used to
    be 11\. That’s compared to 31,445 EV charging locations, including over 4,000
    capable of 150kW or more.

    I’m confident that the company is merely hedging its bets in an entirely sensible
    fashion. There may be parts of the world where the rapid fueling possibility of
    FCEVs and gasoline-like distribution infrastructure are preferable to BEVs, so
    BMW wants to explore that and be ready just in case. But most of its energy is
    going into BEVs, which are clearly going to be the mass market winners in the
    developed world.

    cars aren’t perfect, but if you look at how far we’ve come in the last four years
    it’s like night and day. There are now multiple products to choose from in most
    segments and lots of cars offer over 300 miles of range. This is really all about
    politics. Those on the right politically see “anti-net zero” as another stick
    to bash “progressives” with, alongside xenophobic anti-immigration sentiments.
    Trump has promised to “drill baby drill” and will clearly roll back as many of
    Biden’s green initiatives as he can if he gets into power this year. The British
    Government has softened its stance, leading [a House of Lords Committee to argue
    for more progress](https://allaboutevs.info/news/uks-ev-strategy-needs-a-jumpstart-warns-parliament-committee/
    "https://allaboutevs.info/news/uks-ev-strategy-needs-a-jumpstart-warns-parliament-committee/").
    Some UK Conservative politicians are even calling for the reopening of coal mines
    (after Conservative Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher infamously shut most of them
    in the 1980s). The British Labour Party has dropped its £28bn green pledge, fearing
    the projected cost would be used against it during the campaign for this year’s
    British election.

    The EU’s climate service has claimed global warming breached +1.5C across the
    whole of 2023 compared to pre-industrial temperatures, for the first time ever.
    But there also reasons not to be worried that the electric car will be killed
    like it was 25 years ago. For a start, the market is much more established now,
    with every large mainstream carmaker participating and infrastructure suppliers
    realizing there is an increasing charging market to profit from. There’s also
    the threat from China, which has less ICE incumbency to worry about in its home
    market and is transitioning to EVs at a rate of knots.

    mainstream. I started writing about EVs because it felt like the home PC market
    in the mid-1990s – full of enthusiasts and rapid innovation, making it exciting.
    But now everyone has a computer in their pocket. Likewise, the EV is entering
    a similar phase. It’s no longer a toy for a weird bunch of die-hard early adopters.
    The great cars that arrived around 2020 are coming off lease and entering the
    secondhand market, increasing affordability, and some manufacturers are starting
    to make vehicles for reasonable prices. That’s probably why the incumbents who
    will be displaced are now fighting back with articles and social media disinformation.
    They can see the threat is real.
