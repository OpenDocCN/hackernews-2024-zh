    ones. The logical arguments flow easy - small pull requests are easier to review,
    less likely to have bugs, and are faster from inception to deploy. There are a
    few papers around this that I love - see the references section at the end of
    this post for further reading.

    They’re 15% less likely to be reverted than 250-line changes and have 40% more
    review comments per line changed. If your median PR is 50 lines long, you’re probably
    shipping 40% more total code than your teammate writing 200+ line PRs.

    see that the smallest PRs are almost five times faster than 2-5k line PRs. Intuitively
    this makes sense - smaller PRs mean less lines of code, and less code means a
    lower chance of having destructive or meticulous changes which in turn leads to
    a faster review.

    faster again. I can only assume this is a combination of blind stamps, assumed-safe
    refactors, package additions or generated changes; perhaps both authors and reviewers
    start shrugging when they can’t even scroll to the bottom of the change.

    per line. If we care about landing a PR as fast as possible, the data tells us
    to make it as small as possible. But if we want to land as high volume of code
    as fast as possible, a 2000-line PR merges at a rate of about 12 lines per hour,
    whereas a 10-line PR merges at about 0.25-2 lines per hour.

    line PRs are reverted noticeably more than 10-100 line PRs. If I had to guess,

    I suspect this is because the extreme end of PR sizes includes refactors, which
    maybe start including less functionality change and therefore have a slightly
    lower chance of breaking. Alternatively, engineers may become progressively more
    reluctant to revert PRs after 10k lines because of emotional anchoring and merge
    conflicts.

    you can choose whether or not you want to split your PR into smaller changesets.
    If you want to get the most feedback on a single PR, write a length 1-2k diff.
    If you want the highest chance of a blind stamp, keep it under 10 lines. This
    information is useful to know when all you care about is getting a single specific
    change out the door with as little debate as possible.

    There’s a practical limit to how much code your reviewer is willing to read -
    I suspect that 2k lines is the point at which “reading” a PR becomes “skimming”
    a PR.

- en: If what you care about is maximizing the amount of engagement and feedback on
    your code over the long run, you’re best off writing as small of PRs as possible.
    They’re more digestible, and you can approach a max rate of one comment on every
    39 lines of code you write. Alternatively, if you hate written feedback, make
    your PRs larger than 10k lines, and you’ll start receiving stray comments on only
    every 6000+ lines of code you change - take this with a grain of salt though,
    since people rarely put up PRs for the sole purpose of getting feedback/engagement.

    We all want to be high velocity, but there are times when you need to be high
    volume. Consistently writing sub-20 line PRs will have a significant impact on
    your net coding ability - but interestingly, so will writing PRs greater than
    100+ lines. The highest volume coders and repositories have a median change size
    of only 40-80 lines. I suspect this is because the volume of code is change-size
    * speed of changes. Too small of changes, and the faster merge time doesn't make
    up for it. Too large, and you start getting weighted down by slower review and
    merge cycles.

    median PR size of 50 lines - it's generally the size of PR we stick to here at
    Graphite. Obviously this comes with some edge cases that were discussed above
    and specific changes may require you to flex up and down in size, but know that
    doing so may come at a noticeable cost with respect to review quality, speed,
    and the chance that changes may need to be reverted.
