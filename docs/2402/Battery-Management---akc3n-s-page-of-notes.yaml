  zh: 十六年后，内置电池的手机有自己的设备内部计算机，可以考虑电池经历的充放电周期，并根据需要自动重新分配过量备份，以确保它们自动透明地设置充电和截止阈值，以确保电池随时间而保持最佳健康状态。这使得以前普遍认为的80%充电的观念已经过时了。
- en: Not only that, but when your phone’s battery is reported at 100% and charging,
    the battery enters idle maintenance, which ensures that the battery is not going
    to self-discharge, without overcharging it. In this state, the phone can remain
    on and be powered off external power from USB, rather than using the battery.
    This is important to the health of your battery by reducing the amount of demand
    you’re placing on it.

  zh: 不仅如此，当你的手机电池报告显示100%并正在充电时，电池进入了空闲维护状态，这确保了电池不会自行放电，而又不会过度充电。在这种状态下，手机可以保持开机并且是依靠USB的外部电源供电，而不是使用电池。这对电池的健康非常重要，因为它减少了你对它施加的需求量。
- en: So the long story short, if you decide you want to charge to only 80%, and then
    unplug your phone once it’s reached that threshold, you’re not doing your battery
    any favours; it’s not making use of idle maintenance, and instead of running on
    external power on idle maintenance, the demand is now being placed on the battery,
    and you’re using valuable charge cycles when otherwise your phone would be running
    on external power.

  zh: 简而言之，如果你决定只充到80%，然后一旦达到这个阈值就拔掉手机，那对电池没有任何好处；它不利用闲置维护，而是将需求放在了电池上，而否则你的手机将在外部电源上运行。这会极大地减少你的电池寿命。根据你的使用模式和你多久微观管理手机的电源，这可能会将电池的耗损量增加一倍以上。简而言之，它可能会将你的电池有效寿命减少到原来的一半！
- en: This can *greatly* reduce the lifespan of your battery. Depending on your use
    patterns and how often you micromanage your phone’s power, this can more than
    *double* the wear on your battery. In short, it could reduce your battery’s effective

- en: Nickel Cadmium (NiCd), and to an extent Nickel Metal-Hydride (NiMH) batteries
    are prone to suffering “Memory Effect.” If they were recharged prior to being
    discharged fully, their capacity would often be permanently reduced. They had
    to be deep-cycled in order to maintain their health because that was just how
    their chemistry worked. Nickel Cadmium batteries were prone to requiring manual
    management and often offered far fewer charge cycles. Back in those days, Nickel
    Cadmium batteries were more or less ubiquitous because better alternatives did
    not exist for the average consumer, and that lead to popular advice being to never
    charge your battery until it was dead.

  zh: 镍镉（NiCd）电池，甚至是一定程度上的镍氢（NiMH）电池容易出现“记忆效应”。如果它们在完全放电之前就已充电，它们的容量往往会永久减少。它们必须深度循环以保持其健康，因为这就是它们的化学原理。镍镉电池往往需要手动管理，并且通常提供远远少于充电周期的次数。那些年代，镍镉电池几乎是无处不在的，因为平民消费者没有更好的选择，而且普遍的建议是永远不要将电池充电到用完。
- en: Nickel Cadmium Batteries are now obsolete and were largely phased out of the
    market at the end of the 1990’s, and Nickel Metal-Hydride batteries aren’t going

- en: The last phones to use Nickel Cadmium batteries were car phones, which were
    large, cumbersome affairs that haven’t been produced since the 1980’s. Since the
    2000’s, mobile phones have instead relied on lithium polymer batteries, which
    are entirely unrelated to the old fashioned Nickel Cadmium batteries and have
    nothing in common with them chemically. They are an entirely different technology,
    and must be handled entirely differently; for instance, Nickel Cadmium batteries
    must be stored completely discharged, but doing the same to a lithium polymer
    battery will cause the electrolyte in it to crystallize, which will permanently
    damage a lithium polymer battery.

    necessary; the battery has its own onboard computer that will automatically select
    the best rate of charging for your battery, and takes into account the current
    level of the battery, the amount of heat in the handset, and the feedback it gets

- en: It’s often not spoken of, but Universal Serial Bus is actually an extremely
    complex protocol, and subsequent generations of it has only increased the amount
    of complexity it has. USB actually relies on software negotiation between the
    two devices to determine which device is supplying the power and which device
    draws it, and then determine the correct level of power. Older, or worse, cheap
    chargers may not support this properly nor be adequately made to spec. Cheap cables
    may be insufficiently wired, not have all the necessary wires needing for this,
    and may not even permit this negotiation to happen at all even on chargers that
    do.

    where it’s going to break from regular use even if you otherwise do everything
