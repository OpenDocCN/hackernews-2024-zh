[Apple TV+](https://variety.com/t/apple-tv-2/) has ordered a series adaptation of the [William Gibson](https://variety.com/t/william-gibson/) novel “Neuromancer,” *Variety* has learned.

The 10-episode series hails from co-creators Graham Roland and JD Dillard. Roland will also serve as showrunner, while Dillard will direct the pilot. Skydance Television will co-produce with Anonymous Content.

Per the official logline, the series “will follow a damaged, top-rung super-hacker named Case who is thrust into a web of digital espionage and high stakes crime with his partner Molly, a razor-girl assassin with mirrored eyes, aiming to pull a heist on a corporate dynasty with untold secrets.”

“We’re incredibly excited to be bringing this iconic property to Apple TV+,” said Roland and Dillard in a joint statement. “Since we became friends nearly ten years ago, we’ve looked for something to team up on, so this collaboration marks a dream come true. Neuromancer has inspired so much of the science fiction that’s come after it and we’re looking forward to bringing television audiences into Gibson’s definitive ‘cyberpunk’ world.”

Roland and Dillard also serve as executive producers on the series alongside David Ellison, Dana Goldberg, and Matt Thunell for Skydance Television. Anonymous Content will also executive produce along with Drake, Adel “Future” Nur, and Jason Shrier for DreamCrew Entertainment, as well as Zack Hayden and Gibson.

“Neuromancer” was Gibson’s debut novel that helped birth the cyberpunk genre. It was first published in 1984 and went on to receive a Hugo Award, a Nebula Award, and the Philip K. Dick Award. The book led Gibson to publish two follow-ups, “Count Zero” and “Mona Lisa Overdrive.” There have been various attempts over the years to adapt the book into a film though none have ultimately moved forward.

This marks the latest Gibson work to be adapted for the screen. Most recently, Amazon debuted a series version of Gibson’s novel “The Peripheral” starring Chloë Grace Moretz. Gibson has also written for Hollywood, including the screenplay for the film “Johnny Mnemonic,” based on his short story of the same name.

Roland recently created the AMC series “Dark Winds” and co-created Amazon’s “Jack Ryan” series. His other writing credits include “Fringe,” “Almost Human,” “Lost,” and “Prison Break.” Dillard has previously written and directed features such as “Sweetheart” and “Sleight” and directed episodes of shows like “The Outsider” and “Utopia.”

Roland is repped by WME, Circle of Confusion, and attorney Michael Schenkman. Dillard is repped by CAA, Circle of Confusion, and attorneys Lev Ginsburg and Grace Kallis. Gibson is repped by Sterling Lord Literistic, Inc. and Berkley/Ace, an imprint of Penguin Random House.
