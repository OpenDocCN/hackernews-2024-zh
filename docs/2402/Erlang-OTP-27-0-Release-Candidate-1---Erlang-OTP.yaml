- en: Safe destructive update of tuples has been implemented in the compiler and runtime
    system. This allows the VM to update tuples in-place when it is safe to do so,
    thus improving performance by doing less copying but also by producing less garbage.

- en: Native coverage support has been implemented in the JIT. It will automatically
    be used by the `cover` tool to reduce the execution overhead when running cover-compiled
    code. There are also new APIs to support native coverage without using the `cover`
    tool.
