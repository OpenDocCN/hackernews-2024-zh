    JR Raphael, who absolutely *does* use it, describes the move as a sign that "[Google
    [has] forgotten why a phone assistant actually matters — and what we, as actual
    users in the real world, need from such a service](https://www.computerworld.com/article/3712864/google-gemini-android-assistant.html?ref=wheresyoured.at)."
    While Google has yet to fully make the move, the writing is on the wall, regardless
    of whether the actual assistant is fit for the task and not, say, [hallucinating
    things that don't exist](https://futurism.com/the-byte/google-gmail-tool-hallucinating-emails?ref=wheresyoured.at).

    publishes  lab-tested evaluations of air purifiers and filters — bemoaned [how
    their Google traffic was steadily declining, despite the high standards of their
    coverage and rigorous review process](https://housefresh.com/david-vs-digital-goliaths/?ref=wheresyoured.at).
    Although HouseFresh occupies a small niche in the tech market, it’s tough to fault
    the quality of its work, with all reviews detailed, tested against a rigorous
    and empirically-driven process, and accompanied with beautiful imagery.

    that readers find useful. Content like HouseFresh’s. Obviously, Google doesn’t
    actually poll the reader of each site, so it has to rely on context clues. It
    can rely on specific telemetry for this, like the length of the article, the number
    of internal and external links, the number of pictures and subheadings, and the
    inclusion of certain language that indicates a level of rigor and depth. It might
    see phrases like “lab test,” or the inclusion of a quote from an external party
    or expert, and look kindly upon them.

    several large publications that gave their seal of approval to low-quality, underperforming,
    and noisy air purifiers, including one that [The Wirecutter (correctly) bullied
    into retracting its advertising claims](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/blog/molekule-retracts-most-of-its-advertising-claims/?ref=wheresyoured.at).
    While these publications often said their reviews were based on empirical, lab-based
    tests, they never actually provided any evidence for this, or even discussed their
    testing parameters. Many publications based their reviews on random unsourced,
    unverified, and unvetted social media comments — including some that, hilariously
    enough, originated from suspected spam bots hawking the dodgy air purifiers.

    affiliate revenue with zero regard for journalistic rigor. To put it bluntly,
    these sites are deliberately lying to their customers, trying to trick them into
    buying expensive crap in order to maximize their quarterly earnings. But Google,
    as HouseFresh argues persuasively, also shares some responsibility for failing
    to identify obvious attempts to game the system, and failing to differentiate
    between a proper review and a listicle filled with affiliate links.

    AI assistant](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaCVSUbYpVc&ref=wheresyoured.at)
    showed people asking it things like "write code for my 3D open world game" and
    "make a logo for my classic truck repair garage Mike's," the latter of which produced
    four usable images in the commercial. When I tried to replicate this in the real
    world, Copilot made [four images with completely incomprehensible text](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/ny4fkuvydvcq0bnmfnylm/h?rlkey=0i0dbnlk2k16esn4v3vawy55x&dl=0&ref=wheresyoured.at),
    only one of which said "Mike's." And while one might come away from the commercial
    thinking you can do *something,* it isn't particularly clear what that something

    obsession with artificial intelligence is a symptom of rot, where products are
    created based on analytics and guesswork rather than actually thinking about what
    a customer might want. Artificial intelligence is allegedly going to change our
    lives, but it's difficult to find one compelling description as to how it will
    do so without tumbling into the murky world of tech bro science fiction — and
    even a $7 million Super Bowl commercial from a $3 trillion tech firm couldn't
    seem to find a tangible use case without outright lying about what the result
    would be.

    rot economy's obsession with symbolic value creation. Tech companies are obsessed
    with juicing metrics to please Wall Street as our phones get flooded with annoying
    notifications and spam calls. The most common ads that I see on Instagram are
    scams where a guy plays a game that doesn't exist so that you'll download one
    of many different awful pay-to-win strategy games, and on Facebook, every third
    post is separated by a carousel of videos that have nothing to do with me, other
    than the fact that Meta wants me to see them. Social networks are no longer for
    networking — they’re content advertising platforms where, if we’re lucky, we might
    just get a chance to see stuff from the people we follow.

    Using a smartphone to browse many modern websites introduces you to advertisements
    that take up a quarter of your screen and actively try to trick you into clicking

    would be, if they saw them as problematic. Useless, misleading advertising improves
    Meta’s earnings, and Google Chrome being slow and ugly doesn’t stop people from
    having to use it for work. It doesn’t matter that mobile browsing sucks, or that
    nobody intentionally clicks a single one of those ads, or that these advertisements
    make us unable to read the content that we originally visited an outlet to read.
    Nothing really matters, as long as the numbers keep going up.

    industries are run by people who don’t see the customer as the recipient of the
    value of a product or service. This problem is central to everything I've written,
    and likely everything I'll ever write. It's bile-inducing and deeply ugly, but
    awareness is just one step in reversing the course of the Rot Economy.
