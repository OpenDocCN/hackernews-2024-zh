- en: People are fascinated with glowing plants, and scientists have now revealed
    how to make these much brighter. This significant achievement, [documented in
    Nature Methods](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-023-02152-y), details genetic
    modifications that enhance bioluminescence in a variety of plants by up to 100
    times. The team of 26 scientists created the brighter plants by optimizing genes
    isolated from multiple species of luminous mushrooms.

- en: The new research builds on an earlier discovery for creating continuously glowing
    plants by inserting DNA obtained from the mushrooms. Those researchers had revealed
    a surprising similarity between mushroom bioluminescence and plant metabolism,
    allowing for more visible light than was previously possible. In this new report,
    the scientists have adapted the inserted genes to further boost luminescence.

- en: Beginning in April, glowing petunias will be available under the brand Firefly
    Petunia, so named because the bright buds resemble fireflies. Last September,
    the USDA reportedly determined through its independent evaluation that Light Bio’s
    genetically engineered Firefly Petunia may be safely grown and bred in the U.S.
