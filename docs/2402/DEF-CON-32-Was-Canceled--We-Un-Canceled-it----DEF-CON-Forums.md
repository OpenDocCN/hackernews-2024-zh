# DEF CON 32 Was Canceled. We Un-Canceled it. - DEF CON Forums

**DEF CON was canceled. We un-canceled it.**

After a great 25 year relationship Caesars abruptly terminated their contract with DEF CON, leaving us with no venue for DC 32, and just about seven months to Con!

We don’t know why Caesars canceled us, they won’t say beyond it being a strategy change and it is not related to anything that DEF CON or our community has done. This kind of no-notice cancellation of a contract is unheard of in the conference business. The parting is confusing, but amicable.

So now we have a challenge. Without a venue, will we be able to UN-Cancel DEF CON 32 before time runs out?

Hackers are flexible. We find solutions. We need a space that can handle an event our size, and configurable enough to accommodate our content. We need a location close to our announced dates, and with super short notice... No small feat.

We immediately scrambled a venue strike team to Las Vegas. Floors were walked. Meetings were held. Hands were shook and options weighed. When the smoke cleared, the field narrowed to one obvious choice and we began forging the requisite agreements.

W00T! DEF CON Is UN-CANCELED!

DEF CON 32 will still be August 8-11 2024, but now held at the Las Vegas Convention Center (LVCC) with workshops and training at the Sahara.

DEF CON 32 will be an adventure where we can try things not possible in our old Casino Hotel spaces. What specifically you ask? Well we are still learning all the specifics but we will have more space, a proper food court, and the largest indoor venue LCD wall in the country.

There are still many questions to be answered, and we have started a live FAQ section on the Forums for DEF CON 32 where we will be updating questions and answers. The initial FAQ is located here:

I look forward to seeing everyone this summer, the start of a new DEF CON era!
