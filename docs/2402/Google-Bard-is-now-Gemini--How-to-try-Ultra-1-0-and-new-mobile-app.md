Gemini Advanced is available as part of our brand new [Google One AI Premium Plan](https://one.google.com/explore-plan/gemini-advanced?utm_source=gemini&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=gemini_advanced_announce) for $19.99/month, starting with a [two-month trial](https://one.google.com/explore-plan/gemini-advanced?utm_source=gemini&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=gemini_advanced_announce) at no cost. This plan gives you the best of Google AI and our latest advancements, along with all the benefits of the existing [Google One Premium plan](https://one.google.com/about/plans?utm_source=gemini&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=gemini_advanced_announce), such as 2TB of storage. In addition, AI Premium subscribers will soon be able to use Gemini in Gmail, Docs, Slides, Sheets and more (formerly known as Duet AI).

We continue to take a bold and responsible approach to bringing this technology to the world. And, to mitigate issues like unsafe content or bias, we’ve built safety into our products in accordance with our [AI Principles](https://ai.google/responsibility/principles/). Before launching Gemini Advanced, we conducted extensive trust and safety checks, including external red-teaming. We further refined the underlying model using fine-tuning and reinforcement learning, based on human feedback. You can find more detail in our updated [Gemini Technical Report](https://storage.googleapis.com/deepmind-media/gemini/gemini_1_report.pdf).

## Easily use Gemini on your phone

We’ve heard that you want an easier way to access Gemini on your phone. So today we’re starting to roll out a new mobile experience for Gemini and Gemini Advanced with a new app on [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.bard&utm_source=keyword_blog&utm_medium=owned&utm_campaign=blog_gem_24q1) and in the [Google app on iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/google/id284815942?ppid=cdfe7851-5436-45cf-9eb8-60dd08f22ead&pt=9008&mt=8&ct=oo-pmm-web-gem-24q1blog).

With Gemini on your phone, you can type, talk or add an image for all kinds of help while you’re on the go: You can take a picture of your flat tire and ask for instructions, generate a custom image for your dinner party invitation or ask for help writing a difficult text message. It’s an important first step in building a true AI assistant — one that is conversational, multimodal and helpful.

### Android

On Android, Gemini is a new kind of assistant that uses generative AI to collaborate with you and help you get things done.

If you download the Gemini app or opt in through Google Assistant, you'll be able to access it from the app or anywhere else you normally activate Google Assistant — hitting the power button or corner swiping on select phones, or saying “Hey Google.” This will enable a new overlay experience that offers easy access to Gemini as well as contextual help right on your screen — so you can, for instance, generate a caption for a picture you've just taken or ask questions about an article you're reading. Many Google Assistant voice features will be available through the Gemini app — including setting timers, making calls and controlling your smart home devices — and we’re working to [support](https://support.google.com/gemini?p=awb_delegations) more in the future.
