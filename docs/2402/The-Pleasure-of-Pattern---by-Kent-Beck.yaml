    for me: why are so many programmers musicians? I’ve sang and played guitar and
    various other stringed instruments since I was 8 and I started programming at
    13, so I’ve lived this dual life for a long time, but I’ve never understood it.
    I’ve heard explanations like “music is mathematical and programming is mathematical”,
    but I was never satisfied with them because they didn’t match my experience. I
    don’t think “mathlich” when I’m programming. Here are the three threads–programming,
    music, and poker–and how they came together for me.'

    when Mr. Burishkin (hi Dave! [ed: RIP]) got mad at our algebra class (this was
    fairly common) and assigned us all 40 trig identities in the book. Usually we’d
    get half or a third of the exercises in a given set. Here was a big pile of work
    I couldn’t get out of easily.'

    stack. The first few were hard. I had to sweat to figure out how solve them. Each
    one posed unique challenges. At this rate the assignment was going to take me
    hours. Somewhere around half way through the assignment, though, a door opened
    in my mind. I’d look at a problem and see it in terms of the problems I’d already
    solved–I can split this in two, transform part 1 into this and part 2 into that
    and I’m done. I blew through the rest of the assignment in minutes, eager to solve
    more.

    I see a big refactoring in terms of a succession of smaller refactorings, when
    I see a big task in terms of independently verifiable sub-tasks, when I see a
    big feature in terms of a succession of features each of which delivers value–at
    all these times I feel good.

    how it works. When we’re really “on”, I will hear him play some interesting phrase
    somewhere in the middle of a song and something will click in my mind. There’s
    no explicit communication at that moment though–no nod, no eye contact, nothing.
    When we get to the end of the song, I will play that phrase as a tag and he will
    too, in perfect time. It is the most exhilarating feeling because we’re so completely
    at risk. If we chose different phrases to play, it would sound terrible and we’d
    look like fools. When we re-invent the ending and pull it off, though, it’s absolutely
    electric, both to play and to hear.

  zh: 我们不计划歌曲的结束。我们每次都以不同的方式结束每一首歌。操作如下。当我们真正“进入状态”时，我会听到他在一首歌的中间演奏一些有趣的乐句，而我的大脑中会有一些东西点击。尽管那时没有明确的沟通——没有点头，没有眼神接触，没有任何东西。当我们到达歌曲的结尾时，我会演奏那个乐句作为标签，他也会在完美的时间里演奏。这是最令人振奋的感觉，因为我们是如此完全处于风险之中。如果我们选择了不同的乐句演奏，听起来会很糟糕，我们看起来像傻瓜。然而，当我们重新发明结尾并成功地实现它时，这绝对是兴奋的，无论是演奏还是听。
- en: This is the most extreme example I have of matching patterns in music, but music
    is full of patterns–what makes a phrase, what makes a chord, what rhythm or rhythms
    are going on, what style should this piece be played in, backing up an unfamiliar
    tune by ear, and on and on. I enjoy music because I enjoy those moments of discovering
    the patterns in a piece. When I see a pattern, I feel satisfied. Woodshedding
    (practicing physical skills) is necessary to be able to take advantage of patterns
    when I see them, but I don’t enjoy it the way some people do. Experiencing music,
    for me, is experiencing patterns.

  zh: 这是我在音乐中找到的最极端的匹配模式的一个例子，但音乐充满了模式——是什么造就了一个乐句，是什么造就了一个和弦，有什么节奏或节奏在进行中，这首曲子应该以什么风格演奏，在听不懂的曲调时，通过耳朵支持，等等。我喜欢音乐，因为我喜欢在一首曲子中发现模式的那些时刻。当我看到一个模式时，我感到满足。当我看到它们时，锻炼（练习物理技能）是必要的，以便能够利用它们，但我不像一些人那样享受它。对我来说，体验音乐就是体验模式。
- en: When I started studying poker I didn’t have any particular expectations, I was
    just interested. One of the basic problems in poker is having a more accurate
    belief about your opponent’s hand than they have about your hand. Their patterns
    of betting give you clues. At some point you say, “He must have just gotten a
    second queen,” because how he is playing doesn’t make sense otherwise. When I’ve
    guessed right, I noticed that I have a moment of the same kind of emotional pattern
    matching satisfaction that I have when I’m playing music or programming. That’s
    when I made the connection–this feeling is familiar, it happens when I program
    *and* when I play music.

  zh: 当我开始学习扑克时，我没有任何特别的期望，我只是感兴趣。扑克中的一个基本问题是对手的手牌比你更准确地认知。他们的下注模式给你提示。在某个时候，你会说，“他一定是刚刚得到了第二个皇后”，因为他的玩法否则就毫无意义。当我猜对时，我注意到我有一种与我在玩音乐或编程时相同的情感模式匹配满足感的时刻。那时我意识到——这种感觉很熟悉，它在我编程*和*演奏音乐时都会发生。

- en: The bigger the stakes and the bigger the pattern, the greater the satisfaction.
    I won’t play poker for much money because I’m not any good at it. However, I experience
    more satisfaction when I see big patterns in programs (what some people call “architecture”)
    or big patterns in music (the so-called “long phrase”).

- en: I suspect that my chaotic early life left me with a brain wired to crave moments
    of order and feel good when I find them. That and the innate ability to see patterns
    led me to activities where I got frequent mental rewards. I’ve just identified
    this connection, so I haven’t done any background studies into the neuro-science
    of pattern matching. From my experience I would guess that the same kind of dopamine
    release that accompanies other pleasurable activities happens in my brain when
    I match a pattern, musical or programmatical. I’d also like to see an fMRI to
    understand the neural activation patterns at such times and see if programming,
    music, and poker all really have similar physical neurostructures.

  zh: 我怀疑我混乱的早期生活让我的大脑渴望秩序并在找到时感到愉悦。这种天赋与看到模式的能力使我参与到那些能给予我频繁精神奖励的活动中。我刚刚发现了这种联系，所以我还没有对模式匹配的神经科学做过任何背景研究。根据我的经验，我猜测在我匹配音乐或编程模式时，与其他令人愉悦的活动伴随的多巴胺释放是一样的。我也想看看fMRI，以了解这些时刻的神经激活模式，并看看编程、音乐和扑克是否真的有类似的神经结构。
- en: My daughter Lindsey is also a pattern matcher, but she matches patterns of human
    behavior. She has a good sense of what people are thinking or feeling based on
    cues that are totally invisible to me. I wonder if there are any studies correlating
    skill at reading people with skill at music. Are psychologists musicians the way
    programmers are musicians, or are musical and programming pattern matching similar
    in a way that musical and social pattern matching aren’t?

    kind of pattern matching. What is the evolutionary advantage of being able to
    match abstract patterns? Assuming it increases evolutionary fitness, what is the
