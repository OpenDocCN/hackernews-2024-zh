- en: The value of a non-pecuniary (free) product is inherently difficult to assess.
    A pervasive example is open source software (OSS), a global public good that plays
    a vital role in the economy and is foundational for most technology we use today.
    However, it is difficult to measure the value of OSS due to its non-pecuniary
    nature and lack of centralized usage tracking. Therefore, OSS remains largely
    unaccounted for in economic measures. Although prior studies have estimated the
    supply side costs to recreate this software, a lack of data has hampered estimating
    the much larger demand-side (usage) value created by OSS. Therefore, to understand
    the complete economic and social value of widely-used OSS, we leverage unique
    global data from two complementary sources capturing OSS usage by millions of
    global firms. We first estimate the supply-side value by calculating the cost
    to recreate the most widely used OSS once. We then calculate the demand side value
    based on a replacement value for each firm that uses the software and would need
    to build it internally if OSS did not exist. We estimate the supply-side value
    of widely-used OSS is $4.15 billion, but that the demand-side value is much larger
    at $8.8 trillion. We find that firms would need to spend 3.5 times more on software
    than they currently do if OSS did not exist. The top six programming languages
    in our sample comprise 84% of the demand-side value of OSS. Further, 96% of the
    demand-side value is created by only 5% of OSS developers.
