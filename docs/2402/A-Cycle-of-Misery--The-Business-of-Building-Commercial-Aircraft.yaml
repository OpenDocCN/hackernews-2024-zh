    learning curves very important. As [discussed previously](https://www.construction-physics.com/p/where-are-my-damn-learning-curves),
    learning curves are the phenomenon that production costs (or some related measure
    such as labor hours) tend to fall by a constant percentage for every cumulative

  zh: 这给飞机制造商带来了一些困难。首先，这使得学习曲线变得非常重要。正如之前所讨论的，学习曲线是指生产成本（或一些相关度量，如工时）随着生产量累积翻倍而以恒定百分比下降的现象：从生产10个到20个单位产生的成本降低百分比与从10,000个到20,000个单位产生的成本降低百分比相同。
- en: High-volume products spend most of their time on a relatively “flat” portion
    of the learning curve, where doublings are farther and farther apart. If you’ve
    produced 1,000,000 of something, whether you make another 500 or 5,000 will make
    almost no difference in learning curve terms. But if you’ve only made 50 of something,
    making another 500 makes a huge difference in the level of cost reduction that
    can be achieved. Thus, if you only plan to sell a few hundred of something, a
    relatively small number of sales will have a large impact on how efficiently you’re
    producing and how profitable you are.

- en: Commercial aircraft manufacturers rely on getting enough orders to push them
    far enough down the learning curve where they’re making enough money per plane
    to earn back the costs of developing it. Early planes might be produced so inefficiently
    that they’re sold for less than it costs to make them. This is typically in the

  zh: 这些困难的结果是，飞机制造商非常谨慎地考虑开发新飞机：风险很大，回报微薄且不确定。简单地修改现有模型通常是一个更安全的选择 - 保持相同的基本机身结构，并增加更高效的发动机或微调翼型，或者将其加长以增加乘客容量。修改现有模型的成本仅为从零开始设计新飞机的成本的10-20%，并且几乎可以获得同样多的好处。典型的新飞机可能比现有设计更节省燃料20-30%，但波音公司能够在改进后的737
    MAX上提高15-16%的效率。对于航空公司来说，更新现有模型也更便宜，因为他们不必重新培训飞行新飞机的飞行员。

  zh: 要了解这种计算在实践中是什么样子，让我们看看波音737的历史，这款飞机自1967年首飞以来已经多次修改和更新。
- en: 'Boeing first developed the 737 in the mid-1960s as a short range, small capacity
    aircraft to flesh out its product line and prevent Douglas from having the entire
    low-end of the market to itself with its DC-9\. Initially, it was not particularly
    successful, nor was it expected to be: Douglas had a 2-year head start with the
    DC-9, and Boeing’s earlier 727 was already serving much of that market, albeit
    with 3 engines instead of the more efficient 2 engines of the 737 (all else being
    equal, the fewer engines an aircraft has, the less expensive it will be to operate).
    In fact, the program was very nearly canceled shortly after it was launched due
    to poor early sales. To minimize development cost and time, the 737 was designed
    to share as many parts as possible with the earlier 707 and 727.'

  zh: 波音在1960年代中期首次开发了737，作为一款短程、小型飞机，以充实其产品线，并防止道格拉斯凭借其DC-9独占市场的低端。最初，它并不特别成功，也没有被期望如此：道格拉斯用DC-9领先了2年，而波音早期的727已经在很大程度上占据了市场，尽管它采用了比737更高效的双发（其他条件相同，飞机的引擎越少，运营成本就越低）。事实上，由于早期销售不佳，该项目几乎在启动后不久就被取消。为了尽量减少开发成本和时间，737被设计为尽可能与早期的707和727共享部件。
- en: Early 737 performance was lower than expected, so Boeing developed an “advanced”
    version with improved aerodynamics in 1970\. But even with these improvements,
    Douglas’ struggles building the DC-9, and an order for a military version of the
    737 (The T-43A trainer), sales were still sluggish. The aircraft was being built
    at just a rate of two per month, and until 1973 the program was on the verge of
    being canceled (during this period Boeing nearly went bankrupt due to cost overruns
    on the 747 program, and had to lay off 75 percent of its workforce). The 737 was
    only saved because it was finally being sold for less than its production costs,
    but it was not expected to pay back its development costs.

  zh: 早期737的性能低于预期，因此波音在1970年开发了一个带有改进空气动力学的“先进”版本。但即使有了这些改进，道格拉斯在建造DC-9时遇到的困难，以及对737的一项军用版本（T-43A教练机）的订单，销售仍然疲软。飞机的产量仅为每月两架，直到1973年该项目濒临取消（在此期间，由于747项目的成本超支，波音几乎破产，不得不裁员75%）。737之所以得以保留下来，是因为它最终以低于生产成本的价格销售，但并不指望它能偿还开发成本。
- en: 'But sales began to pick up in 1973, and production had reached five aircraft
    per month in 1974\. By 1978, it had against all odds become the best selling jetliner
    in the world, a title which it retained from 1980 to 1985\. Airline deregulation
    in the US had caused a shift in airline strategy: instead of directly connecting
    two cities with low-volume flights, they began to connect through hub airports,
    using smaller, cheaper to operate aircraft. The 737 fit the bill perfectly.'

- en: But Boeing’s competitors weren’t standing still. Douglas launched an updated
    version of its DC-9, the Super 80, with an improved version of its Pratt and Whitney
    engine that made it quieter and more fuel efficient than the 737\. To counter
    the threat, and to deal with ever more stringent noise regulations, Boeing responded
    with the “new generation” Boeing 737-300, which began development in 1981\. This
    version of the 737 added passenger capacity, improved aerodynamics, and had a
    new, more efficient high-bypass turbofan from CFMI (A joint venture between GE
    and the french company SNECMA).

  zh: 但是波音的竞争对手并没有停滞不前。道格拉斯推出了其DC-9的升级版本，即Super 80，配备了改进版的普拉特和惠特尼引擎，使其比737更加安静和燃油效率更高。为了应对这一威胁，以及应对日益严格的噪音法规，波音推出了“新一代”波音737-300，该机于1981年开始研发。这款737的这个版本增加了乘客容量，改善了空气动力学，并配备了来自CFMI的新一代更高效的高涵道比涡扇发动机（CFMI是通用电气和法国公司SNECMA的合资企业）。
- en: Fitting such a large engine under the 737’s wing was a challenge. The 737 had
    been originally designed with low ground clearance to accommodate “second tier”
    airports with somewhat limited stair systems. Extending the landing gear to raise
    the plane would have required shifting the location of the wheel wells, which
    would have changed the structure of the plane enough to essentially make it a
    new aircraft. Instead, the engine was squeezed into the space available, giving
    it a telltale ellipsoid shape. This high bypass engine gave the 737-300 an 18%
    improvement in fuel efficiency versus older generation aircraft, and an 11% improvement
    over McDonnell-Douglas’ Super 80, while still keeping it as similar as possible
    to the previous 737.

  zh: 将如此大的发动机安装在737的机翼下是一个挑战。737最初设计成离地间隙较低，以适应“第二层”机场，其楼梯系统有些有限。将起落架伸长以提高飞机的高度将需要移动轮井的位置，这将改变飞机的结构，使其本质上成为一架新飞机。相反，发动机被挤入可用空间中，使其呈现出一个独特的椭圆形。这种高涵道比发动机使737-300的燃油效率比老一代飞机提高了18%，比麦道公司的Super
    80提高了11%，同时仍然尽可能地与之前的737保持相似。

    success of its A300, Airbus began development of the smaller A320, a direct competitor
    to the 737, in 1984\. The A320 incorporated many advanced technologies, such as
    fly-by-wire, replacing heavy mechanical or hydraulic linkages between the aircraft
    controls and the plane’s control surfaces with lighter electronic ones. By 1987,
    the A320 had already racked up 400 orders, including a large order from Northwest
    Airlines, a longtime Boeing customer. It was clearly going to be a fierce competitor.

  zh: 但就在737-300开始成形之时，一个新的挑战者出现了。继A300取得成功之后，空客于1984年开始研发更小的A320，这是737的直接竞争对手。A320采用了许多先进技术，如电传操纵系统，用轻量化的电子系统取代了飞机控制与机身控制面之间的重型机械或液压连杆。到1987年，A320已经累计获得了400架订单，其中包括长期与波音合作的西北航空公司的大订单。很显然，它将是一个激烈的竞争对手。
- en: Some argue that Boeing could have (and should have) killed the A320 immediately
    by announcing a new “clean-sheet” aircraft. At the time, Boeing was working on
    a 737-sized aircraft called the 7J7, which used an advanced “unducted fan” (UDF)
    aircraft engine from GE. Theoretically, the 7J7 would have been 60% more fuel
    efficient than existing airliners, along with incorporating technologies like
    fly by wire. But the UDF engine had unresolved technical issues like high noise
    generation, and Boeing was concerned with how long it would take to get the 7J7
    to market. Instead, Boeing developed another stretched out version of its 737
    (the 737-400), canceled the 7J7 project, and began to develop an aircraft to fill
    the gap between its 767 and 747, the 777.

  zh: 一些人认为，波音本可以（也应该）立即宣布推出一款新的“全新设计”的飞机而立即淘汰A320。当时，波音正在研发一款称为7J7的737大小的飞机，该飞机使用了通用电气公司的先进的“未导管风扇”（UDF）飞机发动机。理论上，7J7的燃油效率比现有客机高60%，并采用了如电传飞控等技术。但是，UDF发动机存在未解决的技术问题，如噪音较大，波音担心将需要多长时间才能将7J7投放市场。因此，波音开发了另一款加长版的737（737-400），取消了7J7项目，并开始研发填补767和747之间空白的飞机，即777。
- en: But as the A320 continued to encroach on the market and more longtime Boeing
    customers defected (such as United in 1992), it was clear that a replacement for
    the 737 was required. Many once again favored the development of a clean-sheet
    airplane (which Airbus believes would have been catastrophic for the A320, but
    Boeing was gun-shy about new aircraft after the 777\. Though the program was on
    time and delivered an exceptional aircraft, costs spiraled out of control, up
    to $14 billion by some estimates ($28 billion in 2023 dollars) against a projected
    budget of $5 billion. Instead, Boeing launched the “Next Generation” (NG) 737,
    another update to the 737 airframe. The 737NG featured, among other things, a
    new wing design, a more efficient engine which reduced fuel costs by 9% and maintenance
    costs by 15%, and added “winglets” for improved aerodynamics. The 737NG also reduced
    part count by 33% compared to previous versions, while still retaining enough
    commonality to require minimal pilot retraining and staying within the FAA’s “derivative”
    rules. First delivered in December 1997, the 737NG became immensely popular, with
    the 737-800 version selling more than 5000 aircraft over the next 20 years (though
    as we’ve noted, ramping up production came with immense difficulties). However,
    this wasn’t enough to bury the A320, which also continued to sell well. Some Airbus
    people believe that a clean-sheet aircraft would have been catastrophic for the
    A320 in the late ‘90s.

    in Boeing and Airbus’ offerings, and combined made up 70% of the market for commercial
    airliners. Once again Boeing began to consider a replacement for the 737 and initiated
    a project, Yellowstone, to explore clean sheet replacements for the 737 and other
    Boeing aircraft. But the findings weren’t particularly heartening: without a new,
    advanced engine (which wouldn’t be ready until 2013 or 2014), improvements in
    fuel efficiency would be at best 4%. And the technologies it would incorporate
    from the under-development 787, such as advanced composites, would be difficult

- en: But by 2010, with new engines like the Pratt and Whitney GTF and the CFM LEAP
    on the horizon, Boeing was leaning heavily towards a clean sheet 737 replacement.
    Boeing’s hand ended up being forced by Airbus. In 2011 Airbus began work on a
    re-engined A320 with significantly improved performance, called the A320neo (for
    “new engine option”), and used it to partly lure away a major Boeing customer,
    American Airlines (which split a major order between Boeing and Airbus). Airbus
    believed that Boeing would feel forced to respond with its own re-engine rather
    than lose more customers while it developed a clean sheet replacement. Customers,
    for their part, had lost confidence that Boeing could deliver a new aircraft on
    schedule after the 787 debacle, and also preferred that Boeing launch a re-engine
    with a better shot of being on time. A re-engine would have nearly all the benefits
    of a clean-sheet aircraft (~15-16% fuel savings versus 20% for a typical clean
    sheet), cost perhaps 10-20% to develop, and avoid the costs of airlines having

    yet another revision of the 737, the 737 MAX. Fitting even larger engines on the

    required shifting them very far forward and angling them up slightly, which slightly
    changed the performance characteristics of the airplane. To keep its performance
    similar to previous 737s, Boeing created software, MCAS, to try and emulate the
    behavior of earlier aircraft. The MCAS software, and its interactions with various
    sensors, ultimately caused two fatal crashes of 737 MAX flights.
