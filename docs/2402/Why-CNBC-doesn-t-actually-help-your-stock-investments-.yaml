    the stock market, you’d create CNBC, NBC’s financial counterpart that runs on
    cable news and ostensibly tries to make viewers *better* investors. You’d make
    it sober and rational (well, there* is* Jim Cramer, but we’ll get to him later),
    no need to feature anyone foaming at the mouth about stocks that could triple
    in six months or worried Cassandras warning that it’s time to sell everything
    and burrow underground.

    they’re about to lose money in a market downturn. Nervous that they might miss
    a hot trend or stock. Or uncertain that they’re in the right sectors. Then an
    “expert” comes on and says, “Hey, you’re in the wrong sectors—it’s time to leave
    tech for industrials, financials, and health care.” In its sober, rational way,
    the network creates a sense of urgency. Although its tone is never like that of
    an infomercial, sometimes the message is similar. Act *now*.

    can have. “Sit on your ass,” the late Charlie Munger advised investors, emphasizing
    that when it comes to investing, less is more. Feeling nervous leads to excessive
    trading. And “all the evidence shows that individual investors do worse the more
    they trade,” says Jay Ritter, professor of finance at the University of Florida’s
    Warrington College of Business. “Buying and selling something based on what you
    see on CNBC is not likely to be a successful strategy.”

    when the talking heads began discussing Netflix’s earnings, which were due the
    next day. I own Netflix, and everyone with an opinion on the stock on the 5 p.m.
    show *Fast Money* was bearish. One man said confidently (if you don’t sound confident,
    you don’t get on CNBC) that the earnings would probably send the stock diving
    another 10 percent. Netflix had been befouling the tape of late, falling 26.7
    percent in the past three months and declining on 21 of the previous 29 trading
    days. I had already noticed this. My 106.8 percent profit was now a 51.7 percent
    profit. Oopsie.

    could see coming? There’d be no tax consequences, since I held Netflix in a retirement
    account. I could *make *10 percent by avoiding that obvious 10 percent decline.
    Thanks to the out-of-character tizzy watching so much CNBC threw me in, I came
    close to making the trade. Normally, I never dart in and out of stocks, but hey,
    shame on me—if you don’t intend to trade, don’t watch a show called *Fast Money*.

    It seems to mean well, even as it sabotages investor performance. Its questioners
    are smart and well prepared. But its determination to protect the little guy sometimes
    gives it an unarticulated agenda. Consider Nvidia, the sixth-largest company in
    the world by market capitalization and the hottest large-cap stock of 2023 (up
    239 percent). I’m anything but a disinterested observer here. I have 5 percent
    of my portfolio in Nvidia vs. its market weight of 3.3 percent.

    before the tech crash of 2000, but CNBC anchors are not encouraging viewers to
    buy Nvidia. Quite the contrary. While they often chide guests for not owning Apple—or
    enough Apple—they never blame anyone for shunning Nvidia. Few guests say they
    own the stock, and those that do tend to have small positions. Granted, resident
    guru Cramer says he’s wildly bullish on Nvidia, but a quick look at the CNBC Investing
    Club portfolio, which he runs, tells a different story. Nvidia accounts for 2.9
    percent of Cramer’s portfolio, less than its 3.3 percent market weight. So, mathematically,
    he’s slightly* bearish* on Nvidia, although he is bullish compared to … almost
    everyone else who appears on CNBC. (On Jan. 2, he reduced his holdings in Nvidia
    and Apple, as well as some other large tech stocks.)

    that viewers buy Nvidia at $500\. But he cautioned that if the stock fell to $450,
    people should sell. Five days later, the stock breached $450\. A 10 percent loss
    in a week is obviously not good, and two months later, Nvidia hit $392.30\. At
    least the sell part of Eison’s trade was looking smart. Except that, as of the
    close on Feb. 12, Nvidia is trading at $722.48, so what is someone to do who bought
    at $500 and sold at $450 or $392.30?

    word in their questions seem not to recognize that uncertainty is a constant and
    that simply introducing the word has consequences. If there were certainty, investing
    would be easy, and it’s not. (Munger, who was Warren Buffett’s partner for 45
    years and a great investor in his own right, estimated that only 5 percent of

    holding a larger-than-average amount of cash or suggest that it’s fine if viewers,

    This is dangerous hogwash. Since 1926, cash has returned 3.3 percent a year, woefully
    less than the 10.2 percent delivered annually by the S&P 500 (with dividends reinvested). Which
    means that the CNBC guests who advocate holding 10 percent to 20 percent in cash
    are flattering and deluding viewers. The message: You, the smart viewer, will
    invest this cash at lower prices in a month, six months, or a year. Studies show
    that [this seldom happens](https://www.ifa.com/articles/dalbar_2016_qaib_investors_still_their_worst_enemy).

    and the fear of doing something stupid. I don’t want to be that rare person who
    had a gargantuan gain in Alphabet and then *lost* money. Then again, all great

    so he trims winners frequently, even if it results in more haphazard outcomes
    ultimately. And if noninvestors become investors because of Cramer—then follow
    him—he is performing a service, even if those investors trail the market by 1.7
    percent a year. At least they’re *in the market*. Stocks rise 10 percent a year,
    on average, and are the best investment the average person can make, so being
