    and the fear of doing something stupid. I don’t want to be that rare person who
    had a gargantuan gain in Alphabet and then *lost* money. Then again, all great
    stocks suffer huge declines at some point—Amazon fell over 90 percent from late
    1999 to 2001—and I didn’t want to be caught in that kind of vortex. Silly me.
    I don’t intend to make the same mistake with Nvidia.'

  zh: 结果，我无意中遵循了Cramer的《疯狂金钱》第一条规则：“猪会被宰杀。”这是老式华尔街的智慧，但这是可怕的建议。哦，当然，如果你购买了高度投机的股票或者类似Tupperware这样的原始污水热点股票，在1美元购入并看到它飙升到5美元（现在1.49美元），你应该卖出部分或全部持仓。但当你拥有一家伟大的公司时，规则是不同的。你需要利用你的优势。这并不意味着你允许英伟达占据你投资组合的40%，那将是傲慢的愚蠢行为，但你确实要遵循真正的华尔街智慧：“让赢家奔跑。”我没有坐在我屁股上太久。我认为我的失败是过度风险规避和害怕做愚蠢事的结果。我不想成为那个在Alphabet获得巨大收益后又*亏*钱的稀有人。不过，所有伟大的股票都会在某个时候遭受巨大的下跌——亚马逊从1999年末到2001年跌幅超过90%——我不想陷入那种漩涡。我真是太傻了。我不打算在英伟达身上犯同样的错误。

- en: To be fair to Cramer, maybe he’s not actually looking to maximize profits. He
    says one of his goals is to help his followers stay in the game, to make sure
    they avoid severe losses. He knows that booking profits makes them feel good,
    so he trims winners frequently, even if it results in more haphazard outcomes
    ultimately. And if noninvestors become investors because of Cramer—then follow
    him—he is performing a service, even if those investors trail the market by 1.7
    percent a year. At least they’re *in the market*. Stocks rise 10 percent a year,
    on average, and are the best investment the average person can make, so being
    in the market is essential if you can afford it. Besides, thousands of financial
    planners and money managers charge 1 percent a year for delivering results worse
    than Cramer’s.

  zh: 公平地说克莱默，也许他并不是真的在追求最大化利润。他说他的目标之一是帮助他的追随者留在游戏中，确保他们避免严重损失。他知道盈利会让他们感觉良好，所以经常修剪赢家，即使最终结果更加偶然。如果非投资者因为克莱默而成为投资者——然后跟随他——他正在提供一项服务，即使这些投资者每年落后市场1.7%。至少他们*参与了市场*。股票平均每年上涨10%，是普通人可以进行的最佳投资，因此，如果能够负担得起，参与市场至关重要。此外，成千上万的理财规划师和资产管理人员每年收取1%的费用，提供的结果比克莱默还差。
- en: The CNBC paradox is that giving investors more information can hurt them because—hello,
    hypervigilance—it makes them think they need to act all the time to make money,
    when the opposite is actually true. Going on automatic pilot is the best course
    for most investors, but simply turning on CNBC can make an investor think he needs
    to override the controls. The one thing CNBC anchors can never say is that there
    is a way to avoid losing the investing game. Virtually all investors would do
    better if they owned nothing but index funds and never traded them, except—perhaps—to
    lower their risk profile as they aged.

  zh: CNBC的悖论在于，提供给投资者更多信息可能会伤害他们，因为——嗨，过度警觉——这使他们认为他们需要一直行动才能赚钱，而实际上恰恰相反。对于大多数投资者来说，自动驾驶是最佳选择，但简单地打开CNBC就可能让投资者认为他需要覆盖控制。CNBC的主持人永远不能说的一件事是有一种方法可以避免输掉投资游戏。事实上，几乎所有投资者如果仅拥有指数基金并且从不交易它们，除非——也许——随着年龄增长，降低他们的风险配置，他们都会更好。
- en: ~~You don’t need to know the investing record of CNBC experts to be suspicious
    of what passes for on-air wisdom. Four stock pickers, including Dewardric McNeal
    of Longview Global LLC and Barbara Doran of BD8 Capital Partners, recently mispronounced
    Nvidia as “Nuh-vidia” rather than “En-vidia.” This suggests they’ve never listened
    to a single company conference call or, heck, simply paid attention when other
    pros were discussing the stock. And yet they felt competent to discuss it on national
    television?

    Capital Partners的Barbara Doran在国家电视台上误读英伟达为“Nuh-vidia”而不是“En-vidia”。这表明他们从未听过任何公司电话会议，或者，呃，仅仅是在其他专业人士讨论该股票时没有注意到。然而，他们觉得有资格在国家电视上讨论它？
- en: There’s a cautionary tale there somewhere, but then almost all of CNBC is a
    cautionary tale. Why would a network keep telling viewers to do things that don’t
    work and never tell them to do the one thing that does work?

  zh: 这里肯定有一个警示故事，但几乎所有CNBC都是一个警示故事。为什么一个网络会继续告诉观众去做那些行不通的事情，而从不告诉他们去做唯一行得通的事情呢？
- en: Because that’s its job. Nervous, restless viewers, not stock outcomes, pay the
    bills. It’s fine if the viewers’ portfolios don’t do all that well, as long as
    viewers worry enough to tune in. There’s no incentive to protect them from themselves.

    And remember, losing money in Nvidia is a terrible thing.~~

  zh: 因此，相反，你要保护他们不要进入英伟达。告诉他们，他们因为错过了英伟达的巨大涨势而不应感到遗憾，因为现在他们很可能为时已晚。在这里追逐会让他们贪婪，甚至可能愚蠢。记住，在英伟达亏钱是一件可怕的事情。~~
