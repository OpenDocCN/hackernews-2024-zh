- en: The Kuiper Belt is characterized by a high density of rocky, icy objects (icy
    because it's very far from the Sun, and very cold). It's filled with large rocks
    and dwarf planets, and a whole bunch of objects that we can't really see because
    they're relatively small, and it's very dark out there. But dust can tell us a
    fair bit about what's going on.

    of Neptune, some 30 [astronomical units](https://www.sciencealert.com/how-big-is)
    from the Sun, and extends outward for an unknown distance. However, the inner
    main region was thought to peter out at about [50 astronomical units](https://science.nasa.gov/solar-system/kuiper-belt/facts/).

    units, [in 2015](https://www.sciencealert.com/nasa-makes-history-with-closest-flyby-of-pluto),
    and kept going. In January 2019, it [flew by a strange object named Arrokoth](https://www.sciencealert.com/the-furthest-object-humanity-has-ever-reached-looks-like-a-giant-red-snowman),
    which orbits the Sun at an average distance of [44.6 astronomical units](https://science.nasa.gov/solar-system/kuiper-belt/arrokoth-2014-mu69/facts/).

    kept collecting data, assiduously beaming it back home to Earth. And guess what?
    Its [Venetia Burney Student Dust Counter](https://pluto.jhuapl.edu/News-Center/News-Article.php?page=062906)
    (SDC) is detecting way more dust than scientists expected there to be at that
    distance.

    or solar radiative forces are unexpectedly pushing dust from denser regions out
    into that space.

    objects – collisions, for example. That means there needs to be enough icy rocks
    out there that they come together with relative frequency.

    region of the Kuiper Belt might extend as far as 80 astronomical units, meaning
    the discovery is consistent with hints that the Kuiper Belt just might be larger
    than expected.

    from the Sun. It's now in its second extended mission, operating past initial
    expectations, and still sending data home. Scientists hope that it will last at
    least as far as 100 astronomical units, and perhaps, if we're lucky, as far as
    the [very edge of the Solar System](https://www.sciencealert.com/strange-ripples-have-been-detected-at-the-edge-of-the-solar-system),
    beyond 120 astronomical units.
