    it, easily set it to default and to continue using it – all without interference
    from the operating system. Windows users do not currently enjoy this freedom of
    choice.

- en: To investigate Microsoft’s tactics and the impact on consumers, Mozilla commissioned
    Harry Brignull and Cennydd Bowles, independent researchers and experts in harmful
    design. Today, the researchers have published a report detailing how Microsoft
    prevents effective browser choice on Windows. In the report, they document how
    Microsoft places its own browser — Edge — at the center of its operating system
    and weaponizes Windows’ user interface design to undermine people selecting rival
    browsers.

    own design guidelines. In many cases, it can lead to (and exacerbate) consumer
    harm and undermine competition from rival browsers. This kind of behavior is particularly
    concerning for an independent browser like Firefox, which is reliant on the operating
    systems provided by companies who are also rival browser vendors.

- en: Self-preferencing from operating system/browser providers is an area Mozilla
    has previously highlighted, for example, in the [Five Walled Gardens report](https://research.mozilla.org/browser-competition/5wg/).
    Recently, details of many issues Mozilla experiences competing on major operating
    systems were published on the [Platform Tilt dashboard](https://blog.mozilla.org/netpolicy/2024/01/19/platform-tilt/).

- en: Now, with the implementation of the Digital Markets Act in the European Union
    marking the start of a wave of global competition regulation, we hoped that the
    barriers to browser competition would be dismantled. However, even where there
    is movement in the right direction, improvements have been incomplete and are
    grudgingly offered only in markets where regulators have forced platform owners
    to make changes to respect browser choice. For example, Apple’s decision to allow
    alternative browser engines is only effective in the EU.

    to stop some of the actions it takes to force Edge on users who have selected
    other browsers. Unfortunately, these changes only address a small number of the
    tactics outlined in this report. And, to make matters worse, they will only be
    deployed to users in the EEA.

    their choices inhibited, overridden and undermined by Microsoft’s use of harmful
    design. Regulatory action around the world is needed to restore browser choice
    and competition across all of the major platforms.
