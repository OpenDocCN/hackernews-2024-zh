- en: 'Apr 24 2024 A New Lack of Information ------------------------- I was sitting
    at my computer this evening googling about a half-formed question, something like
    “how much of the current U.S. and world economy is made up of goods versus services,
    how is a ‘good’ defined, and is there any sign that the U.S. service economy is
    losing ground in the post-Covid era?”–when it occurred to me (or rather, occured
    to me _all over again_) that all of the sources I found online were not very good.
    Now, if I brought a little prior knowledge and intentional effort the question,
    if I searched for respectable public institutions–like the Fed–that put their
    data online, I would surely find a start to these questions. But these are things
    that one would have to know. For the average person, you want to know the answer
    to something non-commercial, you just start typing questions as they occur to
    you, and you will probably give up clueless because online search these days is
    remarkably bad. It’s not that all of my questions had been targeted by low-quality
    content farm sites, but rather that a lot of the more mainstream sites that came
    up first–like a link to a LinkedIn post, or a Forbes article, or a Harvard Business
    Review blurb– were all generalist filler. And on down for several pages, with
    the occasional news article from a few years ago or a general Wikipedia topic
    (”Service economy”) thrown in. Search is not very good in large part because the
    sites that count as “average” are mediocre at best. And don’t get me started on
    bots like ChatGPT. Yes, you ask a question like this of a bot and you get a coherent
    answer back, but whence this answer from the void? Maybe some services like Bing
    will give you a few citations attached to the answer, but guess what? Those citations
    are just sourced from the same search services I was complaining about above.
    If the two services that currently define the information landscape are search
    (Google _et al_) and chat (ChatGPT etc), then we are choosing between a graveyard
    of irrelevant “content” and a polished but low-context book report. Even as more
    life is spent online, the online world gets thinner and thinner. More often, when
    I want to know something, I find myself confronting a situation that had nearly
    slipped from my memory: how would I figure this out if I _wasn’t_ online? Who
    would I ask, and how would I go about asking it? What identifiable _source_ would
    I need to read? To me, the idea that a little more space might be opening up behind
    the screen is an exciting thought. But I do worry that if the internet completely
    falls apart as an information ecosystem, there will be nothing left to backstop
    it anymore. What would a revitalized world of information look like, without that
    now-old idea of the “world wide web?” Tags information internet Permalink Feb
    21 2024 Dayswork -------- I’ve been reading Jennifer Habel’s and Chris Bachelder’s
    book _Dayswork_. Actually, dipping into it, then falling away; losing interest
    for a while. then coming back. The episodic approach to reading works quite well
    for a book, written during the Covid pandemic, in an aphoristic format. Many of
    its passages could be tweets. The book has the feel of something written in a
    makeshift desk–maybe from a closet–when the writer is supposed to be doing something
    else (I don’t know, exactly, what the writing process was for _Dayswork_). But
    it also reads like a product of the distracted modern condition of reading. Judging
    by how active even many serious writers have been on X/Twitter over the past decade,
    I suspect that distraction is also the predominant condition of writing today.1
    The waves of “Melville revival” that brought him into the American canon have
    always had an obsessive devotion to the historical Melville; the quotidian, _real_
    person: adventurous, flawed, idiosyncratic. _Dayswork_ contributes to the cult
    of the author. While the book does use Melville’s literary work as an anchor,
    it spends just as much time pecking at the minutia of the author’s life. The book
    spends a lot of time introspecting about other figures connected to Melville,
    some of them people he knew (his wife Lizze Shaw, daughters Elizabeth and Frances)
    and others later interpreters or admirers, like Elizabeth Hardiwick. One of the
    most frequently mentioned figures, “The Biographer,” is still commenting on Melville
    as of early 2024\. The Biographer remains unnamed until the book’s end. He is
    Herschel Parker, a retired English professor and Melville scholar from the University
    of Delaware. Author of not just a Melville biography, but of a Melville meta-biography.
    And, most relevant to _Dayswork_, he also maintains an active blog in which–guess
    who?–Melville comes up a lot. As a character, Parker does not come off well in
    the book. After it was published he responded with obvious annoyance. _Dayswork_
    is above all a book of personalities, and I have a few thoughts about its relationship
    to personas like Parker. Are its antagonisms really any different than authors
    in the pre-internet era, inserting gossip about contemporaries into their books?
    Writers have included one another in fictionalized form, walking all the way up
    to libel and beyond, since before mass printing began. But there is a sense of
    detachment in how the authors speak about Parker, as if what they say about him
    is not so much directed at him–as with a debate or conversation–as it is whispered
    about him. Take this episode in Chapter 6 > On the morning of the wedding Melville
    took a walk on the Common. > > Or, Herman sallied out early in the forenoon for
    his last vagabondizing as an unmarried man,” in the words of the Biographer. >
    > Whose blog entry for today, I see, reports a frustrating transaction with Netflix:
    > > He ordered the BBC’s Cymbeline starring Helen Mirren, but instead received
    a “hyper-violent” version from 2015 featuring dirty cops and a biker gang. > >
    “Sealed it up and sent it back.” > > Which must mean, my husband pointed out,
    that the Biographer still has a DVD subscription to Netflix. > > Not wanting to
    pay to access the movie through Amazon Prime, he ordered a copy on eBay, asking
    the seller to make sure it wasn’t the violent biker version. > > For days, according
    to his blog, the Biographer has been yearning to listen to the Act V recognition
    scene in the BBC version of Cymbeline. > > Earlier this year he wrote that while
    doing exercises in the middle of the night he’d been listening to film adaptations
    of Shakespeare, including some other version of Cymbeline— > > “Nothing more consoling
    than Act 5 over and over.” Let this be an example to anyone who posts the trivial
    ups-and-downs of everyday life to the internet–or a blog :). Parker is someone
    who has elected to put himself on display. One difference between an old-school
    blog like Parker’s and modern social media is that the following on a blog is
    harder to see. From the inside of a blog, there is always a little bit of a sense
    of talking to oneself. From the outside–when you comb through the archives of
    someone’s thoughts, especially the old ones–there is always a little bit of a
    voyeuristic quality, like looking at someone’s private papers or files. But voyeurism
    has not gone away with modern social media, which has–if nothing else–lowered
    the bar for two-way participation on the internet. Still, to be online is to be
    hit with far more “content” than one’s capacity to produce it. This makes “lurking,”
    a term that refers to passive reading of old-school internet message boards, into
    the default online condition. When reading _Dayswork_, it is hard to get past
    the sense that the authors are very online, lurking around their subject(s). I
    don’t even know if they would dispute this claim. Maybe it is because of the pandemic,
    which made both acquaintances and strangers feel far away for a while, that the
    book feels like it is gossiping about all of its subjects–even Melville. In _Dayswork_,
    like the pandemic, being online is a condition that is endured. The short-form
    writing–the distracted writing–that thrives on the contemporary web is well-suited
    to this gossip. Even if they are writing about a master of American long prose,
    one of _Dayswork_’s accomplishments is to bring a tweet-sized version of Melville
    into view–a Melville that is both viable to and relevant within the distraction
    economy. Tags herman\_melville literature contemporary aphorism Permalink Feb
    7 2024 The Internet of Information: Ends and Beginnings ------------------------------------------------
    A useful but somewhat unsatisfying definition of “information” is that it is anything
    that reduces uncertainty. For some time I have found myself thinking about the
    conditions under which the internet–I”ll define it here as a worldwide information-sharing
    network–might wither away substantially, or even disappear from recognition. Those
    thoughts have only accelerated for me as it appears that the internet, in its
    contemporary form, is becoming an ever-more parasitic on itself. ChatGPT, which
    was likely produced through large-scale bulk collection of as much of the internet
    as possible, is only the latest version of this trend. There is more incentive
    than ever to capture information on both the intake side–through super-dominant
    platforms that host the great majority of the world’s new information that enters
    the internet each day–and on the archival and retrieval side–where ever-more information
    is “read” by bots and metadata collection agencies. On the 2024 internet, web
    activity by bots and automated tools is almost evenly split with the traffic generated
    by actual humans. Yes, this network of interconnected smaller networks known as
    the internet is likely to be kept around as long as possible, since it is has
    a lot of uses (many of them lucrative) to so many. This is the _infrastructure_
    internet, the network that connects things for its own sake, because it is always
    potentially useful to be able to send a message to a faraway place. By objective
    measures the internet is still growing at a considerable year-over-year pace.
    But is the amount of _information_ on the internet still growing? The internet
    took on a new life when it became a series of interconnected documents. When I
    write “document” here, I don’t just mean text in any specific format (although
    a lot of early internet documents were in fact plain text). Instead I mean document
    in the most abstract sense: a unit of information. Information rarely stands alone;
    it is always based on prior efforts to know or establish something, if only implicitly.
    Therefore any document owes its existence to others which came before it. The
    internet can be thought of as an attempt to make as many documents–information–visible
    and “on the map,” to make the relationship between information units explicit–and
    to foster the creation of new connections that would not have been otherwise created.
    The typical internet growth chart begins in 1990, near the time when Tim Berners-Lee’s
    research group implemented a version of hypertext for linking documents into a
    single network. In a 1999 reflection on the fast-maturing internet, Berners-Lee
    recounts the type of general relationship that he wanted to create with hypertext:
    > So long as I didn’t introduce some central link database everything would scale
    nicely. There would be no special nodes, no special links. Any node would be able
    to link to any other node. This would give the system the flexibility that was
    needed, and be key to a universal system. The abstract document space it implied
    could contain every single item of information accessible over networks–and all
    the structure and linkages between them. > > Hypertext would be most powerful
    if it could conceivably point to absolutely anything. Every node, document–whatever
    it was called–would be fundamentally equivalent in some way. Each would have an
    address by which it could be referenced. They would all exist together in the
    same space–the information space.1 Berners-Lee strove for a decentralized document
    network: everything could be linked to everything else only because there was
    no priority between the units. The intention to decentralize the network points
    to a curious feature of this model: it is a network with infinite extent (links
    can always be added) and no depth (documents cannot establish priority over one
    another, only connection). By making it easy to establish links between documents,
    the modern public internet became widespread at the expense of establishing its
    authority. To give an example, if you want to know something obscure about the
    city of Cleveland, Ohio, then the internet is usually the the first and primary
    (most common) method, and the most expedient one (because it is fast and never
    closed)–but only rarely does it have the final answer on any issue.2 And yes,
    this goes for Wikipedia , too. The informational internet started to come under
    strain at soon as it began to replace the authorities upon which it implicitly
    relied. Electronic communication has replaced authoritative knowledge with knowledge
    that is merely “the fastest” and the “most expedient,” and this in turn has replaced
    information with “information about information” (metadata). What are the signals
    on a social media platform–the “like,” the “view,” engagement, etc–other than
    a way to turn metadata into a public, gamified social signal? Information itself
    becomes “content,” which is really just a way of valuing the container over the
    thing itself. There is no guarantee over the long run that a worldwide public
    network continues to draw any trust or interest. It is quite possible that there
    continues to be a network through which Bank A can send a request for funds transfer
    from Bank B, but that there is nothing of use on that network to the public at
    large. Most or all of the indicators of activity on the internet today–number
    of links, visits or reactions–have no connection to its status or value as information.
    What I wonder is if and how long this continues. It is possible that the internet
    settles into a status of quasi-stable dystopia, washed over by regular waves of
    distracting and entertaining sideshow–maybe this can just continue forever. But
    it is also possible that the whole thing falls apart over time. This would be
    the more hopeful outcome, but it would require a painful breaking point: paranoia
    grows and trust wanes so badly that it becomes clear the only sane choice is abandonment,
    as deflated and boring as a reality without worldwide connection might look, at
    first. And what comes after? Who can say, but I doubt it would be a return to
    paperbook books and snail mail. Maybe a set of more manageable, deliberately regional
    networks take the place of the worldwide web; maybe what is now called information
    becomes so rare that a new value attaches to it, and it begins to grow back. Tags
    collective action web commons communication Permalink Jan 24 2024 Dilemmas to
    Start With in the Humanities Today ----------------------------------------------
    I have come across a few different sources lately that debate the importance of
    the humanities. Among them: 1\. Agnes Callard: “I Teach the Humanities, and I
    Still Don’t Know What Their Value Is” 2\. The Liberating Arts: Why We Need Liberal
    Arts Education The institutional situation is that a lot of these subjects still
    draw interest from undergraduate students, especially in their first year(s),
    before they have to pick a major. But fewer students choose to stick with the
    humanities: the most recent long-term report I could find said 25 percent fewer
    from 2012 to 2020, although there may have been a slight swerve upward since then.
    The overall trends are extremely worrying for the survival of many humanistic
    disciplines across the entire American university system. The theories about the
    cause of the decline are everywhere, so prominent and repetitive that most are
    not even interesting to summarize. Everyone working on the inside of these departments
    has to decide for him or herself why the humanities are declining. A few thoughts:
    1\. When the argument is about the societal importance of the humanities, there
    may just be a mismatch between what humanistic culture contributes to collective
    life (a lot, I think), and what is in the short-term advantage of any single student
    to study and pursue. That is, there may not be enough good cases for “risking”
    one’s own future to study humanities, even if everyone–including those who don’t
    study the humanities–are better off if there is a critical mass of people who
    do. 2\. It could also be that the humanities are as much effect as they are a
    cause of a healthy society. That is, the humanities don’t make people or societies
    good, they follow when these things _already are_ healthy and “good.” When people
    enjoy some stability, confidence in themselves, and sense of future continuity–it
    is at this point that many people choose to engage with ultimate, open-ended questions
    in literature, philosophy, art, etc. Or, when a culture becomes troubled, these
    subjects are still practiced, but they move out of institutions. This could be
    because the institutions contribute to the underlying problem, or because institutions
    like the university no longer understand open-ended inquiry as worth pursuing.
    Both seem to be occuring in our own time. 3\. In places where the humanities are
    doing well and at the center of what a college does, the setting is often religious,
    or otherwise not invested in the critical humanities. This means places like Hillsdale
    College, where “Western values” and the “Western tradition” make up a fixed curriculum
    attached to a confident moral and political project. And usually, it’s a project
    with a built-in constituency. For the forseeable future, there will be a huge
    cultural gulf between the faculty at these schools and secular American humanities
    departments–to the point that people on either side will not recognize one another
    as a legitimate version of the humanities. I am not religious, and yet I wish
    there was more exploration of how the humanities didn’t have to be the critical
    humanities. Humanistic study appears indefinitely stuck in cul-de-sac of critical
    detachment: many mainstream academics recognize the problem. But it seems to me
    that there is a different-in-kind problem that presents itself here: if you’re
    doing critical work and you want to stop, it’s very hard to do that without abandoning
    academia entirely. To my knowledge, there are a few senior people with tenure
    who, say, write novels instead of criticism, but there is no way to even propose
    that within the formative stage of one’s career. I would love to hear counterexamples.
    Maybe the way out of the critical trap is to trade in some humanities departments
    for more art schools. 4\. Finally, I worry that the humanities looks too much
    like a closed book today, that the humanities are still too focused on “the tradition,”
    antiquarianism, and old things in general. This is obviously not true of all humanistic
    work, including the humanistic knowledge that is most implicated in the American
    culture wars today. But for the humanities in their present endangered state,
    the real struggle is to get students to take the classes and read the books at
    all. In other words, it’s hard to persuade students even to be consumers of humanistic
    knowledge. And so it would be beyond the pale, almost unthinkable, to propose
    that more students _produce_ humanistic work. But as much as we need more people
    who have a deep sense of history, of the strangeness of other historical moments,
    I worry that the humanities start at a disadvantage when they are presented mostly
    in terms of the past. There needs to be a more expansive vision of what it means
    to produce humanistic work today, such that more students can see themselves in
    that work–regardless of their major or what they go on to do for work–and the
    humanities looks more like a living, ongoing, future-oriented project. Tags criticism

    use rideshare apps that often these days. Over the break I used the Uber app for
    the first time in a while. Little things had changed here and there in the UI–as
    they usually do with web tech–but I was surprised to see that they now offer a
    setting for “conversational level.” That is, you can set in advance how much your
    driver is supposed to talk to you. But conversation is not actually a function
    of the app that can be dialed up and down. It’s a thing your driver does, a service
    (or disservice) that for the moment, can still only be performed by the driver.
    You are not actually setting anything, just registering a preference that will
    be communicated to the driver along with your other ride information. I don’t
    know why this bothered me, or even made me think. Maybe I don’t use enough person-to-person
    apps. Let’s be honest, for any app in the gig economy, the entirety of the software
    platform is really a way of turning a person (“gig worker”) into a set of menus
    and toggle switches (“grab \[X\] food at \[X\] and bring it to \[X\] by \[X\]“).
    The NYTimes columnist Farhad Manjoo wrote something a few years ago about that
    US college admissions bribery scandal that stuck with me and seems apt here: people
    with enough money to be the buyers in the gig economy have become “socialized
    to easing every hurdle through an app.” He was talking about money (Manjoo: “who
    should I Venmo to fix this thing?”) but another consequence of an endless landscape
    of software-mediated transactions is that both parties are now obligated to relate
    to one another like software. As I reflect on it, I think what actually bothered
    me about the Uber app was just how small and incremental this “setting” is. How
    many more of these options will there be to tap, pulse, interrupt, and shake every
    imaginable extension of a person’s agency? And because the setting is basically
    a fake lever- there’s a real person on the other side of this software lever who
    still gets to choose whether to comply or not–you can program up an infinite number
    of them. They probably won’t have the effect you want, but it will have an effect,
    if only in aggregate. Tags transaction manipulation Permalink Jan 5 2024 Into
    the Distance ----------------- I took this photo from Interstate 77, near Fancy
    Gap, Virginia, looking back southeast to where I’d come from. The mountains on
    the horizon are Pilot Mountain to the right, with its distinctive round knob,
    and Hanging Rock to the left. I love the way the camera captures focus on the
    mountains while allowing foreground objects like the tree and the guardrail to
    blur. Here, like the human eye, the camera renders sharply what it cares about;
    detail reveals itself according to attention given, other objects become a sketch.
    The ridge on the left, in the photo’s middle ground, offers suspense by cutting
    in at a diagonal, revealing the height of the observer and threatening to close
    out the view. The sky, given substance by the cloud ceiling, makes a counterpoint
    to the textures of the ground, breaking only at the horizon to let in the colors
    that outline the mountains. I also love the sense of space in this image, the
    way perspective and distance allows objects of dissimilar size to appear to be
    on the same scale. It is a lightly settled landscape. A town near the lower right
    can be made out, contained by the trees. The mountains are large, but still bounded,
    by the view. The landscape reveals the layout what would otherwise be too close,
    too “on top of me,” to see. A sense of recognitiion: “I was _there_, I am _part
    of that_–that only triggers when the observer is separated from the scene, and
    the scene tucks into the borders of a wider earth. Tags landscapes Permalink Dec
    7 2023 Seeing ------ Three pictures that I wanted to post this fall, that I never
    got around to: I don’t know why–I knew I liked them, and wanted to see them archived.
    Maybe I would find them the following season. But I also know that I liked these
    photos because they reminded me of an act of seeing, that the artifact stood in
    for how I related to something with my own eyes. The photos exist to point: to
    a moment of observational capacity, openness and fulfillment that is far less
    communicable. I’ve been thinking again about what it means to be a naturalist;
    one answer I’ve arrived at is that a naturalist is someone who observes uncontrolled
    situations for their own sake. The qualifier _uncontrolled_ does the work, for
    me, of a more traditional definition of nature: nature is not just that which
    is opposed to the human. I believe so strongly in this observational component,
    I am willing to bend quite a bit on my definition of nature. Streets are a fine
    place, as long as you look. The point is to look with such unrelenting commitment
    that your vision starts to get strange, to be OK with taking away (only, only!)
    the impression and go no further. To rest in what cannot be communicated. Tags
    vision looking nature naturalist Permalink Dec 5 2023 Matter and Beauty -----------------
    This news in astronomy got a bit of attention in a few newspapers last week. The
    discovery was that a distant star system has six planets orbiting at different
    resonances, or rates of orbit, that are related to one another in precise ratios.
    Imagine one planet orbits its star at twice the rate of another planet in the
    same system, a third planet that orbits four times as fast (these ratios are made
    up), and so on. This arrangement is both beautiful to behold and mathematically
    harmonious. Current thinking suggests that these neat arrangments probably arose
    during the formation of the star system, while fusion gets underway, and dust
    and gas accumulate into planets. If these initial relationships still hold, it
    means we are looking at a system whose planetary bodies have not been disturbed
    over billions of years. The perfection of the system can be seen as a mechanical
    time capsule, a glimpse at the original creative force that first pushes stars
    into motion. On a related note, I’ve been returning to Spinoza’s work recently
    because I’m going through this book. I thought of him when I read about this concordance
    of ideal motion and intellectual beauty. In it, I see a phenomenon that Spinoza
    would find particularly pleasing. In his _Short Treatise_, Spinoza writes about
    the two types of _Natura naturata_, or “those modes or creatures which immediately
    depend on, or have been created by God:” “motion in matter, and “intellect in
    the thinking thing.” On matter: > With regard particularly to motion, it belongs
    more properly to a treatise on natural science than here, \[to show\] that it
    has been from all eternity, and will remain to all eternity immutable, that it
    is infinite in its kind… And the intellect: > As for intellect in the thinking
    thing, this too is a Son, product, or immediate creature of God, also created
    by him from all eternity, and remaining immutable to all eternity. Its sole property
    is to understand everything clearly and distinctly at all times. Spinoza was writing
    at a greater level of generality here than that of particular planetary bodies
    in motion or the constructs of an embodied human mind, but I still think that
    he would, at least aesthetically, be struck by the harmony between astronomical
    motion and the constructs of the intellect. The situation offers a natural opening
    to the idea that matter and the intellect are in rational coordination with one
    another: that motion achieves its perfected realization in contemplative understanding,
    and the special status of the intellect is confirmed in the material embodiment
    of what it knows. Tags philosopy physics Permalink Nov 28 2023 Innovation, Nonprofits
    and Cultural Priming ------------------------------------------- Given that I
    am not someone who specializes in this stuff, I am especially tired of thinking
    and writing about AI chatbots. But there are at least two thoughts in this area
    I’d like to see get more attention: * How the OpenAI’s _nonprofit_ status contributed
    to the breakthroughs it made. Over the last few weeks, since the shake-up on the
    board, the company’s unusual legal structure– a nonprofit controlling a for-profit
    corporation–has mostly been the subject of ridicule. This is a reflection of how
    badly the current moment has been captured by a certain type of profit-motive
    narrative about creative breakthroughs–at least the capture of those who are in
    a position to do most of the reporting on OpenAI. The consensus I read is that
    OpenAI’s non-profit structure has been holding it back for a while, that it was
    an accidental property of its naive founders. I hope, with time, that the stories
    move past this prejudice, and some journalist or ethnographer gets enough access
    to study if and how the company’s unusual corporate structure contributed to what
    it did. Innovation–especially profitable innovation–will always be unpredictable,
    but shouldn’t a non-profit environment for technical _innovation_ be taken more
    seriously? Was there a relaxed field here–maybe a different relationship to work,
    goals, and play–that nurtured the achievements that the for-profit partisans now
    want to take credit for? * All the ways in which ChatGPT reflects a a larger civilizational
    readiness, a cultural priming, to accept automated text generation. If bots like
    this really do maintain their status as breakthroughs once the hype has settled
    down, one of the more curious aspects of its origin story will be how long the
    basic technology was out in the open without any real mainstream reaction. This
    is true since at least 2020 from OpenAI, and Google reportedly had in-house chatbots
    with significant capabilities before that. Why did it take it so long to land,
    and why did it explode when it did? Is there a story here about post-pandemic
    mental exhaustion? Certainly there’s a story here about large numbers of people
    _wanting to do_–doing more of–the things that chatbots do well: sit for long periods
    of time in front of screens, sending chat bubbles back and forth, and write the
    things (e.g., code) that chatbots are trained to do well. I wonder, without the
    conditions that lead large numbers of educated people to sit inside in front of
    computers all day, if chatbots would seem so impressive. There’s also a backstory
    here about an algorithmic way of life, of which chatbots are just the latest,
    strangest chapter. Chatbots may be philosophical zombies that usurp human qualities
    in the body of a computer, but computers had to draw humans a little closer before
    that became possible. Tags computing ai Permalink Oct 25 2023 Parts of the Intellect
    ---------------------- Over the past year, as OpenAI’s ChatGPT has gone from a
    specialist tool to a worldwide cultural phenomenon, there has been one anxious
    question controlling the discussion: is this time different–are computers now
    _really_ intelligent–and what does this change about the human self-understanding?
    If human beings are exceptional, then it is in large part because of intelligence.
    It didn’t help that a computer was now considerably more likely to pass one of
    the most clearly defined, functional tests for artificial intelligence, the so-called
    “Turing test:” give a human being the chance to pass messages back and forth with
    a partner behind a veil; if the human cannot tell that he or she is conversing
    with a machine, it passes the test. It is intelligent, practically speaking. There
    are a lot of problems with this test. Still, the bar was raised. Furthermore,
    if the standard for “real” artificial intelligence is a moving target, always
    a few steps ahead of whatever computers are currently capable doing, then maybe
    the questions about artificial intelligence are hopelessly philosophical, likely
    to generate new pathways for analysis but impossible to answer with any closure.
    When I wrote above that human intelligence is an _essential_ quality of the human–of
    human exceptionalism–I meant it in two senses of that word: that intelligence
    is (1) a distinguishing quality of the human, and that (2) as a quality, it has
    the special status of an _essence_. The essential quality and its object are hard
    to separate. What is intelligence? Look to human beings, see it in action. What
    are human beings? _Homo sapiens_, thinking things, subjects with intelligence.
    What we may be seeing right now is a shift of intuitions, a breakdown of confidence
    that intelligence is an essentially human quality. This does not mean that artificial
    intelligence is like human intelligence, or that computers are (will someday be)
    _more_ intelligent than humans. But it does suggest that intelligence is increasingly
    detached from how it was previously defined: _through_ human beings.1 A new situation
    emerges; imagine pieces, bits, scraps of (general) intelligence circulating throughout
    the environment. More people may have to make constant judgments about the scope
    of the intelligence of various things. I cannot see into these scraps of intelligence,
    know what they are. Their capabilities and intentions (if they exist) are opaque
    to me–like those of other human beings. Maybe there is a new standard for artificial
    intelligence: is it _necessarily_ unknowable? Then it is intelligent. I am reminded
    of the debate about viruses and life: are they alive? If so, how? Are viruses
    alive in the same way that living things (people?) are? Here is another philosophical
    question that is difficult to operationalize. Viruses interface with life, need
    life, latch onto life and push it in new directions. One cannot help but ask the
    question about viruses because they are so strange; maybe what is being sought
    is another, comparable essence that applies to the virus. The virus, by suggesting
    a comparison with life, makes life seem less like an essential thing and more
    a definable set of processes which can be recombined in ways so strange that categorization
    falls apart. I wonder if something similar is happening with intelligence right
    now. What was once a unitary essence that attached to the human is now being decomposed
    into X number of parts, parts that we can see, uncover, build into new entities
    that display some of the qualities of intelligence, without the human. Tags intelligence
