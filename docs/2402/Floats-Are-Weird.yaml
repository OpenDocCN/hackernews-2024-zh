    limit numerically using Python, because what‚Äôs the worst that could happen? Let‚Äôs

- en: To explain this phenomenon, we need to make a huge simplifying assumption. For
    some operation like $x+y$ when done using floating-point arithmetic, the final
    answer won‚Äôt be exactly equal to the exact value of $x+y$. Let‚Äôs use $fl(x+y)$
    to denote the value of this floating-point calculation. Then we will assume that
    $fl(x+y) = (x+y)(1+\delta)$ for some small $\delta$. The upper bound on $\delta$
    depends on what kind of floating-point numbers we‚Äôre using. Python uses IEEE 754
    double-precision floats, which have a $\delta$ with magnitude at most $2^{-53}$.

- en: You might be wondering why we didn‚Äôt choose a different assumption that $|fl(x+y)
    - (x+y)| < \epsilon$ for some small $\epsilon$. This is because floating-point
    numbers become spaced out farther apart as they get larger, so $fl(x+y)$ for large
    $x, y$ might have a large absolute difference from $x+y$, but the relative difference
    of $\frac{fl(x+y)}{x+y}$ will still be small. Thus, our original assumption is
    indeed the correct one to make.

    which is a Taylor series. Since we are only plugging in very small values of $x$,
    $x^2$ and $x^3$ and other higher powers are very, very small numbers so we can
    simply ignore them. We‚Äôll just say $e^x \approx 1+x$. This is a common trick in
    math and physics. We now get

    Cool, now we can see the source of the error: $x$ is in the denominator, so as

    You might be wondering why there isn‚Äôt an $x$ in this answer. When we plugged
    in $x = 10^{-6}$, it wasn‚Äôt all that close to 1\. This is because with $x = 10^{-6}$,
    our approximations of $e^x \approx 1+x$ and $\log(x) \approx x-1$ aren‚Äôt exactly
    valid since the squared terms do contribute a bit. Basically, our answer is only
    true for when $x$ is very small and close to $10^{-15}$.

    the numerator and denominator end up cancelling each other out, but this is actually
    a pretty misleading explanation. The only way to see why this happens is to crunch
    through the analysis.
