- en: Today, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved [Xolair](https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2024/103976s5245lbl.pdf)
    (omalizumab) injection for immunoglobulin E-mediated food allergy in certain adults
    and children 1 year or older for the reduction of allergic reactions (Type I),
    including reducing the risk of anaphylaxis, that may occur with accidental exposure
    to one or more foods. Patients who take Xolair must continue to avoid foods they
    are allergic to. Xolair is intended for repeated use to reduce the risk of allergic
    reactions and is not approved for the immediate emergency treatment of allergic
    reactions, including anaphylaxis.

    persistent allergic asthma in certain patients. Xolair is also approved to treat
    chronic spontaneous urticaria and chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps in
    certain patients.

    the risk of harmful allergic reactions among certain patients with IgE-mediated
    food allergies,” said Kelly Stone, M.D., Ph.D., associate director of the Division
    of Pulmonology, Allergy, and Critical Care in the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation
    and Research. “While it will not eliminate food allergies or allow patients to
    consume food allergens freely, its repeated use will help reduce the health impact
    if accidental exposure occurs.”  **'

- en: According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, almost 6% of people
    in the United States in 2021 had a food allergy and exposure to the particular
    food(s) to which they are allergic can lead to potentially life-threatening allergic
    reactions (i.e., anaphylaxis). There is currently no cure for food allergy. Current
    treatment requires strict avoidance of the food(s) the patient is allergic to,
    and prompt administration of epinephrine to treat anaphylaxis should accidental
    exposures occur. Palforzia (peanut allergen powder) is an oral immunotherapy product
    approved in patients 4-17 years of age for the mitigation of allergic reactions,
    including anaphylaxis, that may occur with accidental exposure to peanut, but
    its benefits are restricted to peanut allergy. Xolair is the first FDA-approved
    medication to reduce allergic reactions to more than one type of food after accidental
    exposure.

    to immunoglobulin E (IgE), the antibody type that triggers allergic reactions,
    and blocks IgE from binding to its receptors.

- en: Xolair’s safety and efficacy in reducing allergic reactions in subjects with
    food allergies was established in one multi-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled
    [study](https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03881696) of 168 pediatric and adult
    subjects (at least 1 year of age or older) who were allergic to peanut and at
    least two other foods, including milk, egg, wheat, cashew, hazelnut or walnut.
    Researchers randomly gave subjects either Xolair or placebo treatment for 16 to
    20 weeks. The primary measure of Xolair’s efficacy was the percentage of subjects
    who were able to eat a single dose (600 milligrams or greater) of peanut protein
    (equivalent to 2.5 peanuts) without moderate to severe allergic symptoms, such
    as moderate to severe skin, respiratory or gastrointestinal symptoms, at the end
    of the 16-to-20-week treatment course. Of those who received Xolair, 68% (75 of
    110 subjects) were able to eat the single dose of peanut protein without moderate
    to severe allergic symptoms (e.g., whole body hives, persistent coughing, vomiting),
    compared to 6% (3 of 55 subjects) who received placebo; these results are statistically
    significant and clinically meaningful for subjects with food allergy. Of note,
    however, 17% of subjects receiving Xolair had no significant change in the amount
    of peanut protein tolerated (could not tolerate 100 mg or more of peanut protein).
    As a result, continuation of strict allergen avoidance is still necessary, despite
    treatment with Xolair.

- en: The key secondary measures of efficacy were the percentage of subjects who were
    able to consume a single dose (1,000 milligrams or greater) of cashew, milk or
    egg protein without moderate to severe allergic symptoms at the end of the 16-to-20-week
    treatment course. For cashew, 42% (27 of 64 subjects) who received Xolair achieved
    this endpoint compared to 3% (1 of 30 subjects) who received placebo. For milk,
    66% (25 of 38 subjects) who received Xolair achieved this endpoint, compared to
    11% (2 of 19) who received placebo. For egg, 67% (31 of 46 subjects) who received
    Xolair achieved this endpoint, compared to 0% of the 19 who received placebo.
    As a result, Xolair treatment is approved for certain patients with one or more
    IgE-mediated food allergies.

    and fever. Xolair comes with certain warnings and precautions, such as anaphylaxis,
    malignancy, fever, joint pain, rash, parasitic (worm) infection and abnormal laboratory
    tests.

- en: In addition, Xolair comes with a boxed warning for anaphylaxis, which can be
    life threatening, based on pre-marketing and post-marketing reports of anaphylaxis
    that occurred after Xolair administration. Anaphylaxis has occurred after the
    first dose of Xolair, but also has occurred beyond one year after beginning treatment.
    Xolair should only be started in a healthcare setting equipped to manage anaphylaxis.
    For selected patients who tolerate initial Xolair treatments in a healthcare setting
    without anaphylaxis, self-administration (or administration by a caregiver) may
    be appropriate and should be discussed with a healthcare provider.
