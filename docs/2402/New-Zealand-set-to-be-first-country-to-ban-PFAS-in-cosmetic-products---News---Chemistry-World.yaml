- en: PFAS are sometimes used in products such as nail polish, shaving cream, foundation,
    lipstick and mascara. They are added to smooth the skin, or to make cosmetic products
    more durable, spreadable and water resistant. In the announcement on 30 January,
    the EPA said that although research suggests that PFAS are only found in a small
    number of products it was taking a ‘precautionary approach’ to the potential risks.
