- en: HUANG FEIRUO was once a respected scientist who studied ways to make pigs gain
    weight more quickly. He ran government-funded research projects at Huazhong Agricultural
    University in the central city of Wuhan. But last month 11 of his graduate students
    accused him of plagiarising the work of other academics and fabricating data.
    He had also, they said, put pressure on them to fake their own research. On February
    6th the university announced that it had fired Mr Huang and retracted some of
    his work.

- en: Scientific fraud is all too common in China. Bad incentives are a big part of
    the problem. Chinese universities typically reward researchers with promotions
    and funding based on the quantity of papers they publish, not the quality. That
    has got results. In 2017, for the first time, China published more scientific
    papers than any other country. It has kept the top spot ever since. But while
    some of the research has been cutting-edge, much has been dodgy.
