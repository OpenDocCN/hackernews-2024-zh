    change.

    carbon footprint, could change the way oil and gas licenses are awarded in Norway
    – and inspire similar legal challenges to fossil fuel production in other countries.

- en: The court ruled that three petroleum production licenses, held by energy companies
    including Equinor and Aker BP, were invalid largely due to the lack of consideration
    that had been given to so-called “downstream emissions”. That is, emissions from
    burning the petroleum that these firms would extract from the North Sea (also
    called scope 3 emissions).

    oil and gas companies account for the emissions that come from burning their products.
    Similar efforts have been [defeated](https://www.no5.com/media/news/greenpeace-fails-in-attempt-to-challenge-bp-s-vorlich-field/index.html)

    how rules on oil and gas licenses are not aligned with national climate targets.
    I have called for changing these rules so that the downstream emissions the oil
    and gas from a new field will produce are considered when deciding whether it
    should go ahead.

    be overstated, it could seed similar arguments in climate litigation elsewhere.
    This could force governments to consider how drilling for and burning new oil
    and gas will really affect climate change.

- en: Oil and gas companies applying for exploration and production licenses in new
    fields are, in most countries, obliged to produce an environmental impact assessment
    (EIA) for each proposed project. Firms submit these EIAs to the government and
    they are usually made public. The idea is that public scrutiny and participation
    will ensure the government’s final decision is informed and transparent.

    account for a project’s impact on the climate. But this obligation is typically
    interpreted as encompassing the emissions from exploration and production only
    – not from burning the oil and gas extracted.

    and courts in oil-producing countries like Norway and the UK have been reluctant
    to make firms account for the emissions that come from burning the fuels they
    produce. This is despite the fact these scope 3 or downstream emissions [constitute](https://www.wri.org/resources/data-visualizations/upstream-emissions-percentage-overall-lifecycle-emissions)
    67%–95% of overall emissions for oil production.

    do not form a part of the project under consideration. But regulating demand for
    oil and gas, through higher emission standards for vehicles for example, [is not
    enough](https://doi.org/10.1080/14693062.2020.1804315) to tackle climate change.

    a role for courts to clarify if downstream emissions ought to be included. In
    a 2020 [ruling](https://climatecasechart.com/wp-content/uploads/non-us-case-documents/2020/20201222_HR-2020-846-J_judgment.pdf)
    by the Norwegian Supreme Court, in a case dubbed People v Arctic Oil, the court
    decided that downstream emissions were a relevant consideration for environmental
    assessment.

    and the court ruled that such an assessment was not required at that stage. This
    new decision concerns the government awarding production licenses for specific
    fields.

    of the field they intend to drill in, how much oil or gas is there and the quantity
    of downstream emissions it should yield. The court argued that the government’s
    interpretation of the law to exclude downstream emissions at this stage is too
    restrictive and downstream emissions must be considered before granting permits.

    of Energy and take months or years to make its way to the country’s Supreme Court
    for a final decision. While this might delay the drilling, if the government complies
    with the judgment and requires oil and gas firms to make the necessary downstream
    emissions assessment it might still proceed with approving new oil production
    permits – even if the assessment shows considerable downstream emissions.

    constitution with environmental rights provisions like Norway (the UK doesn’t,
