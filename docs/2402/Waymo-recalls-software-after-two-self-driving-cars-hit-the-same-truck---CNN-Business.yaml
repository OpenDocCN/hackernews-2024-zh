  zh: Waymo，作为谷歌母公司Alphabet的自动驾驶汽车部门，在两辆车间隔几分钟后因两辆车连撞同一辆卡车而发布了其自有自动驾驶汽车软件的召回。
- en: Minutes apart from one another, two Waymo cars came across the same tow truck
    that was pulling a pickup truck in Phoenix, Arizona. The pickup was being towed
    backwards and at an angle rather than being lined up straight behind the tow truck,
    according to a [Waymo blog post](https://waymo.com/blog/2024/02/voluntary-recall-of-our-previous-software/)
    published Tuesday. The pickup’s front end was partly in a turn lane next to the
    lane the tow truck was driving in.

  zh: 仅隔几分钟，两辆Waymo汽车在亚利桑那州凤凰城遇到了同一辆拖吊卡车。据[Waymo的博客文章](https://waymo.com/blog/2024/02/voluntary-recall-of-our-previous-software/)所述，这辆拖吊卡车在拖曳一辆皮卡时，不是直接在后面对齐，而是以倒车和角度的方式进行拖曳，皮卡的前端部分部分进入了一个转弯道，靠近拖吊卡车所在的车道。
- en: Both Waymo cars incorrectly interpreted what their cameras were seeing and,
    because of that, wrongly predicted the how the truck was going to move, Waymo
    said.

  zh: Waymo表示，两辆车的摄像头错误地解释了其所见，并因此错误地预测了卡车的移动方式。
- en: After a first Waymo vehicle hit the pickup, the tow truck kept driving. A few
    minutes later, a second Waymo vehicle came across the truck and also hit the pickup.
    There were no riders in either of the Waymo vehicles, although the company operates
    a driverless ride-hailing service in that city.

  zh: 在第一辆Waymo车辆撞击皮卡之后，拖车继续行驶。几分钟后，第二辆Waymo车辆也遇到了这辆卡车并撞击了皮卡。两辆Waymo车辆都没有乘客，尽管该公司在该市运营无人驾驶打车服务。
- en: Following the incidents, Waymo informed local police, a state safety agency
    and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration of the incidents, the company
    wrote. After researching what happened, Waymo changed its vehicle software and
    installed the updated software on all its vehicles between late December 2023
    and early January 2024, according to the blog post.

  zh: 在事件发生后，Waymo通知了当地警察、州安全机构以及美国国家公路交通安全管理局。根据博客文章的描述，Waymo在2023年12月底至2024年初期间研究了发生的情况，并更改了其车辆软件，并在所有车辆上安装了更新的软件。
- en: After discussions with NHTSA, Waymo determined that it should file a recall
    report, which is done when a company makes a safety-related change to vehicles
    on the road. Since Waymo does not sell vehicles to individuals or other companies,
    the software update was confined to its own fleet of self-driving Jaguar I-Paces.

  zh: 经过与美国国家公路交通安全管理局（NHTSA）的讨论，Waymo决定提交召回报告。当公司对道路上的车辆进行与安全相关的更改时，就需要进行召回。由于Waymo不向个人或其他公司销售车辆，因此软件更新仅限于其自有的一批自动驾驶Jaguar
    I-Pace车辆。
- en: “This voluntary recall reflects how seriously we take our responsibility to
    safely deploy our technology and to transparently communicate with the public,”
    Waymo wrote in its blog post.

- en: While self-driving cars were have been pushed by the tech industry as potentially safer
    than human drivers, autonomous vehicles have had repeated incidents involving
    so-called “edge cases,” or unusual situations. While edge cases are, by definition,
    uncommon, with both human and robot drivers logging millions of miles on American
    roads every day, they occur with some frequency.

  zh: 尽管科技行业将自动驾驶汽车视为可能比人类驾驶员更安全的技术，但自动驾驶车辆在涉及所谓的“边缘情况”或异常情况时已多次发生事故。边缘情况通常并不常见，但每天在美国道路上行驶数百万英里的人类和机器人驾驶员都会遇到这种情况。
- en: Waymo’s actions follow an incident last year involving Cruise, General Motors’
    self-driving subsidiary. In that incident, which occurred in San Francisco a Cruise
    vehicle struck a pedestrian that had first been hit by another car and then, following
    the impact, dragged the person across along the road.

    with information in that incident, including not being clear that the person had
