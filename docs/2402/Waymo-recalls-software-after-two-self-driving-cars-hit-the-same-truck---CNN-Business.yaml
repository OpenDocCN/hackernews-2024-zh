    a recall for its own self-driving car software after two of its vehicles hit the
    same truck minutes apart.

- en: Minutes apart from one another, two Waymo cars came across the same tow truck
    that was pulling a pickup truck in Phoenix, Arizona. The pickup was being towed
    backwards and at an angle rather than being lined up straight behind the tow truck,
    according to a [Waymo blog post](https://waymo.com/blog/2024/02/voluntary-recall-of-our-previous-software/)
    published Tuesday. The pickup’s front end was partly in a turn lane next to the
    lane the tow truck was driving in.

    because of that, wrongly predicted the how the truck was going to move, Waymo
    said.

    minutes later, a second Waymo vehicle came across the truck and also hit the pickup.
    There were no riders in either of the Waymo vehicles, although the company operates
    a driverless ride-hailing service in that city.

    and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration of the incidents, the company
    wrote. After researching what happened, Waymo changed its vehicle software and
    installed the updated software on all its vehicles between late December 2023
    and early January 2024, according to the blog post.

    report, which is done when a company makes a safety-related change to vehicles
    on the road. Since Waymo does not sell vehicles to individuals or other companies,
    the software update was confined to its own fleet of self-driving Jaguar I-Paces.

    safely deploy our technology and to transparently communicate with the public,”

- en: While self-driving cars were have been pushed by the tech industry as potentially safer
    than human drivers, autonomous vehicles have had repeated incidents involving
    so-called “edge cases,” or unusual situations. While edge cases are, by definition,
    uncommon, with both human and robot drivers logging millions of miles on American
    roads every day, they occur with some frequency.

    self-driving subsidiary. In that incident, which occurred in San Francisco a Cruise
    vehicle struck a pedestrian that had first been hit by another car and then, following
    the impact, dragged the person across along the road.

    with information in that incident, including not being clear that the person had
    been dragged after being hit.

    testing throughout the country. Numerous Cruise executives left the company. [Cruise
    also issued a recall for its software in that case](https://www.cnn.com/2023/11/08/business/cruise-recalls-self-driving-cars/index.html).
