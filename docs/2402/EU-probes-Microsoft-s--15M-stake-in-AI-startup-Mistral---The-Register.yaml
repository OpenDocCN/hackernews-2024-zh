    investment in French startup Mistral, which came just after the latter released
    a large language model to compete with OpenAI's ChatGPT.

    [Mistral Large](https://mistral.ai/news/mistral-large/), and released a web app
    netizens can use to experiment with a chatbot powered by the model. It also put
    out a smaller model, Mistral Small, which - as the name suggests - is optimized
    to be faster and more compact. Mistral has previously shared other models, such
    as its seven-billion parameter Mistral-7B [in September](https://mistral.ai/news/announcing-mistral-7b/).

    infrastructure from its cloud computing platform to train and run its future systems.
    Mistral co-founder and CEO Arthur Mensch offered enthusiastic endorsement of the
    deal in a [Microsoft statement](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/microsoft-and-mistral-ai-announce-new-partnership-to-accelerate-ai-innovation-and-introduce-mistral-large-first-on-azure/)
    that outlined a shared enthusiasm for "impactful progress in the AI industry and
    delivering unparalleled value to our customers and partners globally."

    deals to involve access to cloudy infrastructure. Microsoft has invested $13 billion
    into OpenAI, while Google and Amazon Web Services have invested heavily into Anthropic.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: These deals are a win-win for both parties. Hosting the latest large language
    models drives more business to cloud platforms, while startups need large clusters
    of GPUs to develop new models. The European Commission, however, is wary that
    AI mergers with Big Tech could consolidate power and crush innovation, making
    it potentially more difficult to regulate the technology and for smaller companies
    to compete.

    "We are inviting businesses and experts to tell us about any competition issues
    that they may perceive in these industries, whilst also closely monitoring AI
    partnerships to ensure they do not unduly distort market dynamics," Margrethe
    Vestager, executive vice-president in charge of competition policy for the European
    Commission, [declared](https://www.theregister.com/2024/01/09/ec_microsoft_openai/)

    rules for AIs based on the risks each represents. Generative AI models like Mistral
    Large or ChatGPT are [considered](https://www.europarl.europa.eu/topics/en/article/20230601STO93804/eu-ai-act-first-regulation-on-artificial-intelligence)
    as "high-impact general-purpose" systems that might pose "systemic risk". Developers
    will be required to disclose the source of their training data and design guardrails
    to prevent them producing worrisome content.
