    says that while WhatsApp did approach it to discuss its interoperability plans,
    the proposed system didn’t meet Threema’s security and privacy standards. “WhatsApp
    specifies all the protocols, and we’d have no way of knowing what actually happens
    with the user data that gets transferred to WhatsApp—after all, WhatsApp is closed
    source,” Weis says. (WhatsApp’s [privacy policy](https://www.whatsapp.com/legal/privacy-policy-eea)
    states how it uses people’s data.)

    early 2022, [many leading cryptographers](https://www.wired.co.uk/article/dma-interoperability-messaging-imessage-whatsapp)
    opposed the idea, saying it adds complexity and potentially introduces more security
    and privacy risks. Carmela Troncoso, an associate professor at the Swiss university
    École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne, who focuses on security and privacy
    engineering, says interoperability moves could potentially lead to different power
    relationships between companies, depending on how they are implemented.

    also maybe close the market in the sense that now the bigger players are going
    to have more decisional power,” Troncoso says. “Now, if the big player makes a
    move and you want to continue being interoperable with this big player, because
    your users are hooked up to this, you're going to have to follow.”

- en: While the interoperability of encrypted messaging apps may be possible, there
    are some fundamental challenges about how the systems will work in the real world.
    How much of a problem spam and scamming will be across apps is largely unknown
    until people start using interoperable setups. There are also questions about
    how people will find each other across different apps. For instance, WhatsApp
    uses your phone number to interact and message other people, while Threema randomly
    generates eight-digit IDs for people’s accounts. Linking up with WhatsApp “could
    de-anonymize Threema users,” Weis, the Threema spokesperson says.

    and the level of support it will make available for companies wanting to integrate
    with it. “Nobody quite knows how this works,” Brouwer says. “We have no idea what
    the demand is.” However, he says, the decision was made to use WhatsApp’s existing
    architecture to run interoperability, as it means that it can more easily scale
    up the system for group chats in the future. It also reduces the potential for
    people’s data to be exposed to multiple servers, Brouwer says.

    Brouwer says, it will be more challenging to add new features to it quickly. “We
    don't believe interop chats and WhatsApp chats can evolve at the same pace,” he
    says, claiming it is “harder to evolve an open network” compared to a closed one.
    “The second you do something different—than what we know works really well—you
    open up a wormhole of security, privacy issues, and complexity that is always
    going to be much bigger than you think it is.”

  zh: 最终，互操作性将随着时间的推移而演变。从 Meta 的角度来看，Brouwer 表示，快速添加新功能将更具挑战性。“我们不认为互操作聊天和 WhatsApp
    聊天可以以同样的速度发展，”他说，声称“与封闭网络相比，发展开放网络更加困难。”“一旦你做出与我们已知非常有效的事情不同的举措，你就会打开一个安全性、隐私问题和复杂性的漩涡，这些问题总是比你想象的要大得多。”
