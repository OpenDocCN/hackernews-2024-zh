    and [Hacking Team](https://www.wired.com/2015/07/hacking-team-breach-shows-global-spying-firm-run-amok/)
    have become notorious for enabling their customers to spy on vulnerable members
    of civil society. But as far back as a decade ago in India, a startup called Appin
    Technology and its subsidiaries allegedly played a similar cyber-mercenary role
    while attracting far less attention. Over the past two years, a collection of
    people with direct and indirect links to that company have been working to keep
    it that way, using a campaign of legal threats to silence publishers and anyone
    else reporting on Appin Technology’s alleged hacking past. Now, a loose coalition
    of anti-censorship voices is working to make that strategy backfire.

    organization that shares part of its name, called the Association of Appin Training
    Centers, have used lawsuits and legal threats to carry out an aggressive censorship
    campaign across the globe. These efforts have demanded that more than a dozen
    publications amend or fully remove references to the original Appin Technology’s
    alleged illegal hacking or, in some cases, mentions of that company’s cofounder,
    Rajat Khare. Most prominently, a lawsuit against Reuters brought by the Association
    of Appin Training Centers resulted in a stunning order from a Delhi court: It
    demanded that Reuters take down its article based on a blockbuster investigation
    into Appin Technology that had [detailed its alleged targeting and spying](https://ddosecrets.com/wiki/Appin_Uncensored)
    on opposition leaders, corporate competitors, lawyers, and wealthy individuals
    on behalf of customers worldwide. Reuters “temporarily” removed its article in
    compliance with that injunction and is fighting the order in Indian court.'

    of other news outlets, however, resistance is building. Earlier this week, the
    digital rights group the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) sent a response—published
    [here](https://www.muckrock.com/news/archives/2024/feb/01/global-censorship-appin-reuters/)—pushing
    back against Appin Training Centers’ legal threats on behalf of media organizations
    caught in this crossfire, including the tech blog Techdirt and the investigative
    news nonprofit MuckRock.

    itself as an educational firm run in part by former franchisees of the original
    Appin Technology, which reportedly ceased its alleged hacking operations more
    than a decade ago—has been involved in any illegal hacking. In December, however,
    Appin Training Centers sent emails to Techdirt and MuckRock demanding they too
    take down all content related to allegations that Appin Technology previously
    engaged in widespread cyberspying operations, citing the court order against Reuters.

    about Reuters' story](https://www.techdirt.com/company/appin/) and the takedown
    order targeting it. So had MuckRock, the plaintiffs claimed, which [hosted some
    of the documents that Reuters had cited](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23457852-2007-appin-presentations-and-pitches)
    in its story and uploaded to MuckRock's DocumentCloud service. In the response
    sent on their behalf, the EFF states that the two media organizations are refusing
    to comply, arguing that the Indian court's injunction “is in no way the global
    takedown order your correspondence represents it to be.” It also cites an American
    law called the SPEECH Act that deems any foreign court’s libel ruling that violates
    the First Amendment unenforceable in the US.

    disappear news articles,” Michael Morisy, the CEO and cofounder of MuckRock, tells
    WIRED. “That's something that fundamentally we need to push back against.”
