    and [Hacking Team](https://www.wired.com/2015/07/hacking-team-breach-shows-global-spying-firm-run-amok/)
    have become notorious for enabling their customers to spy on vulnerable members
    of civil society. But as far back as a decade ago in India, a startup called Appin
    Technology and its subsidiaries allegedly played a similar cyber-mercenary role
    while attracting far less attention. Over the past two years, a collection of
    people with direct and indirect links to that company have been working to keep
    it that way, using a campaign of legal threats to silence publishers and anyone
    else reporting on Appin Technology’s alleged hacking past. Now, a loose coalition
    of anti-censorship voices is working to make that strategy backfire.

    这样的雇佣黑客公司因让客户监视社会弱势群体的行为而臭名昭著。然而，早在十年前的印度，一家名为 Appin Technology 及其分支机构的初创公司据称起了类似的网络僱佣兵作用，但吸引了较少的关注。在过去的两年里，一批直接和间接与该公司有联系的人一直在努力继续保持这种状态，借助法律威胁来让发布者和其他任何报道
    Appin Technology 涉嫌黑客攻击的人保持沉默。现在，一些反审查的力量正致力于让这种策略产生反效果。
- en: 'For months, lawyers and executives with ties to Appin Technology and to a newer
    organization that shares part of its name, called the Association of Appin Training
    Centers, have used lawsuits and legal threats to carry out an aggressive censorship
    campaign across the globe. These efforts have demanded that more than a dozen
    publications amend or fully remove references to the original Appin Technology’s
    alleged illegal hacking or, in some cases, mentions of that company’s cofounder,
    Rajat Khare. Most prominently, a lawsuit against Reuters brought by the Association
    of Appin Training Centers resulted in a stunning order from a Delhi court: It
    demanded that Reuters take down its article based on a blockbuster investigation
    into Appin Technology that had [detailed its alleged targeting and spying](https://ddosecrets.com/wiki/Appin_Uncensored)
    on opposition leaders, corporate competitors, lawyers, and wealthy individuals
    on behalf of customers worldwide. Reuters “temporarily” removed its article in
    compliance with that injunction and is fighting the order in Indian court.'

  zh: 数月来，与 Appin Technology 及其名称相近的新组织 Appin 培训中心协会有关联的律师和高管一直在全球范围内使用诉讼和法律威胁对跨界的审查活动进行了侵略性的打压。这些努力要求十几家出版物修改或完全删除有关原
    Appin Technology 涉嫌非法黑客攻击或在某些情况下提及其联合创始人 Rajat Khare 的内容。值得关注的是，由 Appin 培训中心协会对路透社提出的诉讼导致德里法院出具了一份惊人的命令：要求路透社删除基于对
    Appin Technology 进行的研究而发表的文章，该研究详细描述了该公司据传代表全球客户针对反对派领袖、企业竞争者、律师和富裕个人进行的针对性监视和监听行为。路透社“暂时”遵循了该禁令并正在印度法院反击此命令。

    Appin 培训中心对被卷入这场交火的媒体组织的法律威胁，包括科技博客 Techdirt 和调查新闻非营利组织MuckRock。
- en: No media outlet has claimed that Appin Training Centers—a group that describes
    itself as an educational firm run in part by former franchisees of the original
    Appin Technology, which reportedly ceased its alleged hacking operations more
    than a decade ago—has been involved in any illegal hacking. In December, however,
    Appin Training Centers sent emails to Techdirt and MuckRock demanding they too
    take down all content related to allegations that Appin Technology previously
    engaged in widespread cyberspying operations, citing the court order against Reuters.

  zh: 没有媒体机构声称 Appin 培训中心—一家自称在部分由原 Appin Technology 特许经营者经营的教育公司，据报道超过十年前就停止了其所谓的黑客攻击行动—涉及任何非法黑客攻击。然而，去年
    12 月，Appin 培训中心给Techdirt 和MuckRock发送了电子邮件，要求他们也删除与 Appin Technology 先前涉嫌进行大规模网络间谍行动的指控相关的所有内容，引用了针对路透社的法院命令。
- en: Techdirt, Appin Training Centers argued, fell under that injunction by [writing
    about Reuters' story](https://www.techdirt.com/company/appin/) and the takedown
    order targeting it. So had MuckRock, the plaintiffs claimed, which [hosted some
    of the documents that Reuters had cited](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23457852-2007-appin-presentations-and-pitches)
    in its story and uploaded to MuckRock's DocumentCloud service. In the response
    sent on their behalf, the EFF states that the two media organizations are refusing
    to comply, arguing that the Indian court's injunction “is in no way the global
    takedown order your correspondence represents it to be.” It also cites an American
    law called the SPEECH Act that deems any foreign court’s libel ruling that violates
    the First Amendment unenforceable in the US.

    SPEECH Act 的美国法律，该法律规定，任何违反第一修正案的外国法院的诽谤裁决在美国不可执行。
