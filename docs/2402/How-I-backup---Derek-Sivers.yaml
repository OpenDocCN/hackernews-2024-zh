- en: I’ve written shortcuts for these rsync commands so it’s really as simple as
    me typing `bkz` or `bkstick` in the terminal as I’m working anyway. I do it a
    few times a day, especially if I’ve just made or saved something of value. And
    always right before I shut down the computer, which I do almost any time I step
    away from it for more than a few minutes. That’s why I say it’s like ten seconds
    a day, just typing that command occasionally.

    also has a recent copy of my every-day documents from above. So a few minutes
    a month to connect the USB drives, and I only do the safe deposit box when I’m
    going that way anyway, and only takes a couple minutes.

- en: In the days of spinning-platter hard drives, they used to die surprisingly often,
    so I like the security of many copies. But it also helps to have some deliberately
    behind others, so on the rare case where I’ve deleted something, then rsynced
    my dailies and even my monthly, then realized I need that thing I deleted, then
    I know the drive in the safe deposit box has it since I haven’t updated that one
    in a couple months.
