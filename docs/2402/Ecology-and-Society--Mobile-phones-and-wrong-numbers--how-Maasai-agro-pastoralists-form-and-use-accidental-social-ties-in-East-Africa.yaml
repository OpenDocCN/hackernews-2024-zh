    the Global South, but few studies have examined how phones can shape social networks.
    This study documents a new type of social tie, enabled by mobile phones, that
    to our knowledge has not previously been discussed in academic literature. In
    2018, we discovered that Maasai pastoralists in northern Tanzania create new social
    ties through wrong numbers, a phenomenon with implications for theory on social
    networks and path dependency. We used a mixed ethnographic and survey-based design
    to examine the following: (1) the conditions under which wrong number connections
    (WNCs) are made; (2) the incidence of these connections in the study area; and
    (3) the association between WNCs and multiple livelihood strategies. Working in
    10 rural communities in Tanzania, we conducted 16 group interviews with men about
    their phone use and found that WNCs are diverse and can provide households with
    important information, resources, and opportunities from an expansive geographic
    area. (Nine separate interviews with groups of women revealed that women do not
    create WNCs.) Based on early qualitative findings, we designed and conducted a
    standardized survey with 317 household heads. We found that 46% of respondents
    have had WNCs. Furthermore, multivariate regression models show a significant
    association between WNCs and the controversial practice of leasing land in one
    district. Taken together, our findings show that WNCs can be seen as innovations
    in social networking that reduce path dependency, increase the range of potential
    outcomes, and hold important implications for rural livelihoods in East Africa.'

    the Global South, but evidence of their potential to boost agricultural yields,
    improve market efficiencies, and save lives has been mixed (Aker and Ksoll 2016,
    Wyche and Steinfield 2016, Haenssgen and Ariana 2017, Marler 2018, Quandt et al.
    2020). And phone use is mushrooming. In sub-Saharan Africa, mobile subscriptions
    per 100 people have increased sharply from fewer than 2 in 2010 to more than 82
    in 2018 (ITU 2020). Amidst this growth, the idea that mobile phones can be transformative
    remains evident. Across the world, phones affect how people realize and express
    their identities, inhabit their social networks, and conduct their work (Ling
    2008, Duncombe 2018, Kivikuru 2019). Few studies, however, have examined how phones
    can shape social ties.

    the call is answered, and the parties discover the error, one of two things can
    happen: (1) the individuals end the call; or (2) they begin to chat. This paper

    papers in science. It describes how individuals are more likely to find employment
    through friends of friends, or “weak ties,” than through their “strong ties” with
    close family and friends. This idea has served as a center of gravity around which
    scholarship on social networks and diffusion has orbited for decades. Since Granovetter’s
    paper, the internet and mobile technologies have transformed the ways in which
    social networks are created, maintained, and evolve (Horst and Miller 2006, Ling
    2008, Castells et al. 2009).'

    change in the Global South have been greatly outpaced by the rapid adoption of
    phones in the past decade, their ubiquity even in rural areas, and the steady
    evolution in how they are used (Duncombe 2014, 2018). Of the relatively few studies
    of the consequences of phone use, most have understandably focused on information
    exchange and market integration (Muto and Yamano 2009, Aker 2011, Tadesse and
    Bahiigwa 2015). Few studies have focused on the social outcomes of phone adoption,
    and how these undergird livelihoods and land use.

    structures and processes, e.g., social relations, to better understand the social
    consequences of economic and technological events and trends. This approach is
    well suited to characterizing broad efforts and themes at scale, but important
    factors can also be found in idiosyncratic behaviors at the level of individuals,
    an area under-theorized in research on human/environment interactions in the Global
    South. Notably, very little research has examined the effect of mobile phones
    on social network tie formation, i.e., the connection between two people; a dyad,
    which could be instructive in fields like anthropology and geography given their
    longstanding interests in cooperation (Henrich 2006, Apicella et al. 2012, Kasper
    and Mulder 2015, Molina et al. 2017), social movements (Miller 2000, Peet and
    Watts 2004, Nicholls 2009), and social capital (Fine 1999, Adger 2010), which
    can be seen as the fruits of social connection. With this in mind, we review research
    in sociology on social tie formation.

    review of the sociological research on dyadic ties, i.e., the connections between
    two individuals, Rivera et al. (2010) stratified connection mechanisms into three
    categories: (a) assortative mechanisms, which focus on actors’ individual attributes;
    (b) relational mechanisms, which focus on the structure of actors’ networks and
    their positions within them; and (c) proximity mechanisms that focus on actors’
    social and cultural contexts.'

- en: With assortative mechanisms, social connections are thought to be driven by
    individuals’ attributes, which may include, gender, age, sex, race, ethnicity,
    religion, or education, among others. Two dominant and divergent hypotheses here
    are that, (1) people connect with others who have similar attributes, i.e., homophily;
    and (2) people connect with others who have dissimilar attributes, i.e., heterophily.
    Homophily is especially common in friendship (Van Duijn et al. 2003, Thomas 2019)
    and intimate relationships (Qian and Lichter 2007, Lambert and Griffiths 2018)
    where similarities are understood to promote trust and mutual acceptance, and
    reduce conflict (McPherson et al. 2001, Currarini et al. 2016). Alternatively,
    heterophily often characterizes collaborative groups where diverse skills and
    backgrounds are needed to confront complex challenges (Page 2008, Xie et al. 2016).

    structure of social networks, and individuals’ positions within them. Analyses,
    typically quantitative, expand beyond direct ties to include indirect ties, or
    connections’ connections. Key hypotheses here relate to reciprocity, repetition,
    clustering, and degree centrality, i.e., the number of ties a person has. First,
    people generally reciprocate offered relationships because they tend to like people
    who like them (Montoya and Insko 2008). Second, people tend to form repeated ties
    with each other over time because of trust and social embeddedness in forming
    ties (Baldassarri 2015, Pan et al. 2017). Third, people tend to cluster, or more
    colloquially to become friends with their friends’ friends, in part because people
    who spend time with a shared third-party are likely to incidentally encounter
    each other (Granovetter 1973).

    environments. Rivera et al. (2010) noted that the most basic hypothesis here is
    that interaction increases with geographic proximity, which has been supported
    in many contexts (Marmaros and Sacerdote 2006, Kleinbaum et al. 2008, Arentze
    et al. 2012). But the concept of proximity is not limited to physical distance
    (Gieryn 2000). Social interactions are organized around myriad social, physical,
    economic, and legal institutions that exist in time and space (Feld 1981). People
    connect through the groups they spend time with, at work, through leisure time,
    in their communities, and elsewhere (Grossetti 2005).

- en: As traditionally mobile pastoralists living in ethnically dense, rural areas,
    Maasai exemplify the characteristics of strong ties found in tightly bonded, relatively
    homogenous social networks (Gittell and Vidal 1998) that exhibit relational, assortative,
    and proximity tie mechanisms, often in culturally prescribed ways. Specifically,
    Maasai clan and age-set social institutions are critical and longstanding reservoirs
    of social capital and adaptive capacity for resilient livelihoods. But Maasai
    life has changed greatly over the past several decades (Spear and Waller 1993,
    Homewood et al. 2009). The adoption of new identities (Hodgson 2011) and new economic
    activities, including agriculture and wage-labor migration (McCabe et al. 2010,
    2014), have spurred the famously insular Maasai into greater engagement with political
    processes, the market economy, and new weak ties with outside groups (Baird 2014).
    And in the past decade, these shifts have been attended by the rapid adoption
    of mobile phones throughout Maasailand (Msuya and Annake 2013, Butt 2015).

    phones can support a range of livelihoods, including pastoralist and agricultural
    land uses by improving information exchange, market integration, access to emergency
    services, mobile banking, and human-wildlife conflict (Msuya and Annake 2013,
    Butt 2015, Lewis et al. 2016, Baird and Hartter 2017, Quandt et al. 2020, Krell
    et al. 2021). Notably women’s experiences with phones are more constrained (Summers
    et al. 2020). We are aware of no research that has examined tie-formation in this
    context.

    framework that views, (1) social ties as the basis of social networks; (2) technology
    as a mediator of social ties; and (3) technology-enabled errors as drivers of
    new weak ties, which we refer to as wrong number connections (WNCs).
  id: totrans-split-37

- en: Within our framework, the importance of social ties to Maasai is seen as evolving
    with the ongoing livelihood diversification of the pastoralist economy into privately
    held and managed agriculture, off-farm employment, and wage-labor migration, among
    other activities. A consequence of this trend is that households can benefit from
    new types of information, which may not be available within their immediate social
    networks. Disinformation and fraud are also propagated through mobile phones and
    users must be vigilant (Archambault 2011, Hahn 2012, Baird and Hartter 2017).
    Still, people seek to connect with new individuals and groups to acquire new types
    of information and learn about new opportunities. Mobile phones can dramatically
    reduce the barriers to communication, but questions remain about whether they
    can be used effectively to stimulate new social ties (Donner and Escobari 2010,
    Marler 2018). Despite the abundance of mobile phones in rural areas, there may
    be few opportunities for novel social ties. This, in fact, could be a new chokepoint
    for rural residents wishing to branch out socially and economically. In this context,
    WNCs can be seen as an innovation in social networking with implications for livelihoods
    and land use across wide areas.

    in northern Tanzania. Figure 1 shows five communities north of Arusha (Longido
    district) and five to the south (Simanjiro district). These areas are well suited
    to examine the effects of nascent mobile-phone use on social networks and livelihoods
    in rural, developing areas. First, these rural districts are predominantly ethnically
    Maasai (Mackenzie et al. 2014), which reduces variance along cultural lines. Second,
    phone-use is common in each area despite variable mobile signal (Lewis et al.
    2016, Baird and Hartter 2017, Summers et al. 2020). Third, compared to many other
    groups, Maasai have more homogenous, tightly bonded social networks where members
    share many attributes (Patulny and Lind Haase Svendsen 2007, Borgatti et al. 2009,
    Baird and Gray 2014). Over many decades, Maasai have maintained longstanding traditions
    of polygyny, age-set and clan-based social organization, and forms of mobile pastoralism,
    even as they engage with external ideas and practices through formal education,
    agriculture, and Christianity (Leslie and McCabe 2013, Baird 2015, Woodhouse and
    McCabe 2018, McCabe et al. 2020).

    is much more common in Simanjiro, where rainfall is inconsistent but generally
    higher than in Longido. Land-based tensions surrounding agriculture and land leasing
    there have grown over many years, prompting outside NGOs to collaborate with communities
    to protect traditional communal grazing areas in the study communities (Nelson
    et al. 2010). Also, residents in Simanjiro appear to have better cellular signal
    and spend more money using their phones than residents in Longido.

    to assess the ways that phone use is associated with the maintenance and development
    of social networks; and (3) to inform the development of standardized surveys
    of men and women. Group interviews were stratified by gender. Through these steps,
    conducted in 2018, we first learned that WNCs occur and were not necessarily rare
    among men (RQ1). However, women informed us unequivocally that they (women) do
    not create these types of connections, largely because men often control women’s
    use of phones (Summers et al. 2020). Based on these qualitative insights we included
    a question about WNCs on our men’s survey (RQ2 and RQ3). Results from this survey
    led us to conduct a set of follow-up group interviews (n = 7) with men in 2019
    to learn about the specific circumstances surrounding the formation and development
    of WNCs (RQ1).'

    about mobile-phone use and social networks, as well as the causes and consequences
    of WNCs. For the initial interviews in 2018 we recruited participants from a range
    of socioeconomic backgrounds in multiple sub-villages within the study area. These
    interviews solicited information about how social networks are changing, whether
    phones are affecting social networks, and how phones are contributing to decision
    making. A key question during these interviews was whether respondents met new
    people through their use of mobile phones, a question we have asked groups since
    2014\. Mostly, people responded that they did not, except in certain cases like
    children’s school-teachers. However, once we learned of WNCs in 2018 and began
    asking about it, respondents confirmed its existence and provided personal examples.
    In 2019, we conducted seven follow up interviews with groups of participants who
    had formed WNCs. We asked respondents to describe their WNCs, including the number,
    their locations, why they are important, how they use them to manage problems,
    and whether they have caused new problems. We also interviewed several respondents,
    in group settings, about their decisions not to pursue WNCs (RQ1).

    we surveyed respondents who have participated in longer term research projects
    run by the authors. The sample in Simanjiro, which was started in 2005 and has
    been added to intermittently, is based on a quota sampling strategy (Bernard 2017)
    to create a representative sample. Local leaders have helped us to identify the
    following: (1) households from different administrative units (in proportion to
    the size of the unit); (2) household heads from each Maasai age-set; and (3) households
    representing a spectrum of wealth statuses (proportional to local distributions
    of wealth, where herd size is used as an observable and reliable indicator of
    wealth). The sample in Longido, was drawn randomly from village registries in
    2017 for a related project. Trained Maasai enumerators conducted the survey with
    household heads between September and December 2018\. “Households,” referred to
    as *olmarei* in Maa, the Maasai language, include a household head and his/her
    dependents, which may include multiple wives (in the case of male heads), and

    adjusted for clustering at the level of the village (Angeles et al. 2005). Our
    main explanatory variable was a simple dichotomous measure of WNC indicating whether

    in these communities for many years, and the quality of our relationships in the
    study site strengthened the quality of our data collection efforts. Second, our
    mixed qualitative and quantitative approach combines the strengths of both types
    of data. Qualitative data helped us to understand how the phenomenon occurs and
    characterize some of the causal mechanisms associated with WNCs. Quantitative
    data allowed us to quantify the incidence of WNCs and test their relationships
    with other factors to make generalizations across our study site.

    about the number or timing of their WNCs. We do not know how many WNCs each respondent
    has or whether the relationships were formed in the 12 months before the survey
    was conducted, which is the time period over which our dependent variables were
    measured, or more than 12 months ago. In short, our quantitative survey data do
    not measure the timing of WNCs, however our qualitative interviews provide evidence
    of causal mechanisms and support their use as the primary independent variable.

- en: Connecting through a wrong number is relatively straightforward, but involves
    multiple steps. First, an individual dials a number incorrectly. This may result
    from writing a number down incorrectly to begin with, or simply mis-keying a number
    in the phone, each of which can stem from low levels of literacy, as noted by
    our respondents. Furthermore, the likelihood of these errors may be increased
    by the common practice of using a friend’s phone when one’s battery is dead. Second,
    the receiving party answers the phone in a specific language, signaling to the
    caller something about the receiver’s identity. Third, the error is quickly identified.
    Fourth, the parties either end the call swiftly or they do not. In some instances,
    individuals may chat for a while, especially (but not exclusively) if the receiver
    answers in Maa. Maasai social institutions can help members, who may be far from
    each other geographically, find common ground and mark their social position relative
    to each other. This type of social scaffolding is not present when the receiver
    is non-Maasai, but connections can be made nonetheless. Fifth, when the call ends
    one or both of the individuals may save the contact number for use later. Ultimately,
    the social connection takes root and grows if/when the individuals maintain contact
    with each other, and, in some cases, elect to meet each other face-to-face. There
    can be variations to this general scenario, which we discuss below.

    purchase phone companies’ “bundles,” which provide heavy discounts on a variety
    of different service packages (e.g., minutes, SMS, data, etc.) for a fixed time
    period (e.g., one day, week, or month). For example, a bundle may provide 200
    minutes of calling during a 7-day period for a discounted price. To avoid losing
    unused minutes, we learned that as people near the end of their bundle’s time
    period, some use available minutes to call back unusual numbers in their incoming
    call-log, which they had not answered. Similarly, Maasai get call-backs from people
    they wrongly dialed days before.

    were common. One scenario here is that the callers begin the call speaking Maa.
    With a wrong number, shared ethnicity represents an important shared attribute.
    In these situations, respondents described how they would typically proceed to
    learn about the stranger. First, the parties would exchange family names, i.e.,
    their fathers’ names, then their physical locations, clans, and age-sets. “Then,”
    one respondent noted, “you know how to control the conversation.” Sharing these
    characteristics helps callers to identify other points of connection and inserts
    a culturally prescribed set of conversational norms based on social position.

    way since the beginning.” Respondents also described how they have discovered
    relatives through wrong numbers. During one meeting, a respondent received a wrong
    number call from another Maasai he had never met, and over a short conversation
    learned that their fathers were brothers. It was an astonishingly timely example
    of what we had been discussing. (That cousins would not have known about each

    the weather and the condition of livestock in each area. But some respondents
    also noted that developing connections in distant areas can be useful if they,
    or a friend or family member, ever travel to that area in the future. In one example,
    a respondent described how he had made a WNC with an individual living in a village
    to which his sister had recently moved to be with her new husband and his family,

    livestock movements during times of scarcity.

    for either party. One described how he was able to get land through a WNC in a
    village south of his only to lose it later when a game reserve was set up. In
    another case, respondents told of two men in their village who gained access to
    land for farms in a distant village, where they first brought their livestock
    to access forage, through the WNC. (In these examples, it was not stated whether
    these were leases or land allocations.) Perhaps more commonly, WNCs have sought
    agricultural land within the study area. Many groups in Simanjiro expressed that
    when WNCs learn they have reached someone in Simanjiro they often ask about land.
    In some cases, people end up leasing land to their WNCs. In one example, a respondent
    shared how he dialed a wrong number years ago, became friends with the WNC, and
    now leases him land to farm. In another, a man shared an example, from his village,
    of a WNC from the south of Tanzania who traveled to Simanjiro, leased land to

    friend. And in some cases, WNCs can lead to new employment opportunities. A man
    in Simanjiro shared how he made a WNC near the coast who was looking to invest

    issue was framed in both positive and negative ways. Multiple individuals shared
    how they had welcomed a WNC into the village, either to farm or conduct other
    business. They described how these outsiders had brought benefits to them and
    in some cases their communities. When asked whether people were concerned that
    outsiders who get a foothold in the village may help other outsiders to come,
    many respondents agreed that this was becoming a big problem, especially given
    the difficulty even local people face accessing land. According to respondents,
    outsiders come, some through WNCs, and start a farm or a small shop, then they
    bring more family members and ultimately enroll their children in school to become
    official members of the village, then they seek more land. We were told that when
    some WNCs learn that they have reached someone in Simanjiro, they will call repeatedly,
    badgering the individual about land.

    respondents explained that they do not “follow” wrong numbers because of the prevalence

    get-rich-quick schemes, disease cures, or miraculous plans to find love or fame.
    Another example involves callers who actually know the receiving party’s name.
    Although these calls may or may not present as wrong number calls, they nonetheless
    cast a shadow over phone-based communication for many people, steering them away
    from WNCs. Since 2019, Tanzania has implemented a national phone registry, including
    biomarkers, in an effort to root out these types of fraud.

    time one party fails to show and then never responds. We heard examples of this
    in the contexts of missed employment opportunities and aborted rendezvous between
    men and women. The second type involves the simple loss of one’s phone and all
    its contacts. We heard multiple stories from people with positive, ongoing WNCs
    who lost their valuable weak ties in this way.

    represent the factors by which *TLUs* would be expected to increase (for factors
    greater than 1) or decrease (for factors less than 1) given a 1 unit increase
    in continuous predictor variables, or moving from 0 to 1 for dichotomous variables,
    given that the other variables in the model are held constant. For the multiple
    logistic model of total *Acres* cultivated (two columns), relative risk ratios
    represent the factors by which the relative risks of cultivating a low (*Acres*

    relative risk ratios greater than 1 indicate greater likelihood to farm (i.e.,
    low or high *Acres*) than not to (i.e., zero *Acres*). For the logistic regression
    model of *Leased land*, odds ratios represent the factors by which the odds of
    *Leased land* would be expected to increase or decrease given a 1 unit increase

    networks and mobile technologies in the Global South. Notably, many studies in
    both urban and rural contexts argue that information and communication technologies
    are rarely bridging technologies that connect people with different backgrounds,
    but are used more commonly as tools to catalyze communication within existing,
    tightly bonded groups (Donner 2006, Kobayashi and Boase 2014, Marler 2018). Here,
    amidst widespread use of phones to support bonding behavior with strong ties,
    we also find a rare example of bridging behavior with new weak ties, which contrasts
    somewhat with results that Maasai social networks have not been transformed by
    mobile phone use (Butt 2015, Baird and Hartter 2017).

    independent of relational and proximity mechanisms of dyad formation (Rivera et
    al. 2010). Existing social ties and one’s position within a network play practically
    no role in two people encountering each other through a wrong number. Neither
    does physical proximity, at least within the geographic extent of the phone carrier’s
    network. Our results, however, seem to exemplify a type of assortative mechanism
    that integrates homophily and heterophily. Multiform heterogeneity describes how
    social ties may form between individuals who are simultaneously similar in some
    ways and different in others (Blau 1974). This indeed may characterize many WNCs.
    Shared attributes like language and ethnicity can engender trust, while divergent
    attributes like geographic location or professional expertise provide real economic
    value.

    play in Maasai lives. At a minimum, they lead to new weak ties in a society characterized
    by strong ties and social institutions. Age-set and clan-based structures specifically
    have long been foundations of Maasai resilience (Leslie and McCabe 2013, Baird
    and Gray 2014). New ties with WNCs expand and diversify Maasai networks, allowing
    individuals to gather new information, prospect for new opportunities, and respond
    to shocks. And in some cases, these relationships can help households gain access
    to distant resources. WNCs also embody a new mechanism of tie formation, a type
    of social network jump, wherein new and relatively rare, but important social
    ties are formed without a discernible intermediate tie or activity that confers
    significant bias (like meeting someone on a bus or plane). We are aware of no
    studies that examine social network tie formation expressly outside this context
    of path dependency.

    Our strategy here was guided by respondents’ descriptions of how WNCs can serve
    as conduits to critical land-based resources, especially grazing areas and agricultural
    land. Controlling for multiple factors, including proxies of phone use, we found
    that WNCs were not significantly associated with land-use types, with one exception.
    In Simanjiro, where group interview respondents described leasing land to and
    from WNCs, people with WNCs were much more likely to have leased land in the 12
    months prior to the survey (RQ3). What is striking here is that land leasing,
    which is typically used for monocrop agriculture, is both ascendant and controversial

    into their pastoralist livelihoods, creating numerous tensions in the process
    (McCabe et al. 2010, Baird and Leslie 2013, Woodhouse and McCabe 2018). First,
    advocates for biodiversity conservation have argued that conversion of grazing
    lands to agriculture harms ecosystems (Phalan et al. 2011). Second, as these pastoralists
    have become more sedentary (Fox et al. 2019) and rural population density has
    grown, pressures on land have compounded with many households struggling to secure
    tenure (Muyanga and Jayne 2014) and being generally intolerant of outsiders gaining
    access to local land. So it was notable on several occasions during our group
    interviews when participants described how WNCs can become quite interested when
    they learn that they have connected with someone from Simanjiro, a district known
    for vast tracts of land, and a recent history of agricultural expansion (Nelson
    et al. 2010).

    descriptions of leasing land to WNCs, and otherwise using WNCs to, at times, support
    the activities of herding and farming, support the use of *WNCs* as the explanatory
    variable in our models. However, it is quite possible that an unmeasured individual
    characteristic like ingenuity, industriousness, or perhaps risk tolerance drives
    both WNC and our livelihood measures. Furthermore, we can imagine how success
    in diversified livelihoods could increase an individuals’ likelihood to take a
    chance on a WNC. Attention to these hypotheses requires greater understanding
    of why people embrace WNCs, including psycho-social and economic factors, and
    more detailed data on the timing and characteristics of survey respondents’ WNCs.

    that WNCs may serve as a new mechanism for outsiders to gain access to land in
    rural communities where tensions over land are already high, a concern expressly
    noted during our group interviews. Land-use pressures and disputes strike at the
    heart of this social-ecological system. In this way, WNCs and land leasing represent
    a new challenge for environmental management, cultural change, and community resilience.
    A related and important new question is whether WNCs lead to land conversion,
    or social change, that would not likely have occurred otherwise. Also, do WNCs,
    which represent a type of exogenous multiform heterogeneity, increase volatility
    and accelerate change within the system?

- en: In social networks, as with other networks, processes and patterns are the functions
    of prior conditions and contexts (Ghezzi and Mingione 2007). Path dependency has
    been described as a phenomenon whereby current outcomes are not simply products
    of current conditions, but of prior outcomes. Framed more simply, path dependency
    asserts that “history matters” (Schreyögg et al. 2011). To characterize this implicit
    artefact in social network research, we borrow and adapt from adjacent possible
    theory, first articulated by Stuart Kauffman (1996) to describe complexity in
    biological and other systems and leveraged by others to describe pathways of human
    creativity and innovation (Johnson 2011, Chhatre et al. 2012, Monechi et al. 2017).
    Adjacent possible theory argues that, at any given moment in time, progress can
    only accrue in prescribed ways, limited by its immediate context and the possibilities
    that are adjacent to this context. Innovations do not spring from giant leaps
    but from stepwise progress into adjacent possibilities. Distant connections cannot
    be made until the space between is first traversed.

    is rarely used. People make new connections through adjacencies: family, friends,
    work, church, clubs, groups, chatrooms, etc. These ties, and their ties, create
    the sampling frame from which new ties are drawn. Within this line of thinking,
    social ties result from these myriad biases that place us in our unique contexts,
    and determine our adjacencies. The existence of WNCs, disrupts this implicit maxim
    of social tie formation, and suggests instead that “jumps” to distant, unfamiliar
    points are not only tractable but common in certain contexts.'

    is limited by the past and the present. By prevailing against these constraints,
    WNCs should be expected to expand the range of potential system outcomes, all
    other things being equal, and increase volatility.

- en: This hypothesis raises the question of randomness. Are WNCs random social ties?
    The best answer here is no. Randomness is complete unpredictability. Even genetic
    mutations are not random in a purely mathematical sense. Parallels here may merit
    further comparison. WNCs do reflect the broad evolutionary principles of mutation/selection
    or chance/choice. Chance occurrences, i.e., wrong numbers, provide opportunities
    for selection, i.e., chatting, saving the number, and maintaining engagement,
    based on the perceived utility of the connection for both parties, which may include
    access to distant information and material resources. Arguably, the initial exposure,
    or chance portion of this connection, is much more random than most exposures,
    which are typically governed by various biases. But the selection, or choice,
    portion of the connections adhere to typical assortative mechanisms, especially
    multiform heterogeneity as discussed above. As respondents noted, some new connections
    grow and thrive and others wither and die.

    mechanism of social connection we have discovered, the term “accidental ties,”
    which we use in the title of the paper, distinctly undersells the novelty of these
    social connections. Labels aside, the novelty of WNCs raises the question of whether
    they are idiosyncratic to Maasai, or perhaps groups whose strong social institutions
    embed social ties in a shared culture of trust. Curiously, through informal conversations
    with colleagues about these findings, we have heard anecdotes that WNCs occur
    in places like India and China, often with young people, though scarcity and opportunism,
    rather than trust are seen as drivers of connection. Notably, many WNCs described
    in this study are with non-Maasai Tanzanians and Kenyans, which points to new
    questions: Where else do WNCs occur? How do factors like gender, class, infrastructure,
    and culture affect whether people embrace or avoid WNCs in other places? How are
    livelihoods affected in WNCs’ locations? What effects do WNCs have on household-
    and community-level resilience? And what other mechanisms of social connection
    are analogous to WNCs? Future research should examine these and related questions.'
