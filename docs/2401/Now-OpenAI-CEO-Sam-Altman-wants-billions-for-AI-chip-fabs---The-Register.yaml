    on Friday Altman has approached several outfits, including Abu Dhabi-based G42
    and Japan's Softbank, to help make it happen.

  zh: 引用多位知情人士的多个匿名消息来源，彭博社[Bloomberg在周五称](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-01-19/altman-seeks-to-raise-billions-for-network-of-ai-chip-factories)，Altman曾与包括总部位于阿布扎比的G42和日本的软银在内的几家公司接洽，以帮助这一计划实现。
- en: 'Microsoft, OpenAI''s biggest champion, has reportedly shown interest in the
    project, which would fund the construction and operation of chip factories around
    the world to support growing demand for neural network accelerators. The goal
    of the program appears to be this: build enough assembly lines to ensure there
    is a healthy supply of AI processors to meet demand.'

  zh: 微软，OpenAI的最大支持者，据称对该项目表现出了兴趣，该项目将资助在世界各地兴建和运营芯片工厂，以支持对神经网络加速器不断增长的需求。该计划的目标似乎是：建造足够的生产线，以确保有足够的AI处理器供应来满足需求。

    to be developing an AI accelerator of its own, has previously expressed concerns
    that there aren't enough processors to go around. With world-plus-dog jumping
    on the machine-learning bandwagon, we could agree with that. Meta just indicated
    it wants 350,000 Nvidia accelerators by the end of year to drive [its AGI work](https://www.theregister.com/2024/01/20/metas_ai_plans/).

  zh: Altman，其超级实验室[传言](https://www.reuters.com/technology/chatgpt-owner-openai-is-exploring-making-its-own-ai-chips-sources-2023-10-06/)正在开发自己的AI加速器，此前曾表达担忧，即处理器数量不足。随着全球范围内大量人投身机器学习领域，我们可以认同这一点。Meta刚刚表示，到年底将需要35万台英伟达加速器来支持[其AGI工作](https://www.theregister.com/2024/01/20/metas_ai_plans/)。
- en: If there aren't enough processors to train and run models to meet user demand,
    remote services may suffer from slow downs, rationing, or limited deployment,
    which isn't a great customer experience. Those hoping to use the tech on their
    own infrastructure may be unable to easily source the parts they need.

  zh: 如果没有足够的处理器来训练和运行模型以满足用户需求，远程服务可能会出现放缓、配给或有限的部署，这不是一个很好的客户体验。那些希望在自己的基础设施上使用该技术的人可能无法轻松地获得他们所需的零件。
- en: The certification group Uptime Institute echoed those fears in its latest [analysis](https://uptimeinstitute.com/resources/research-and-reports/five-data-center-predictions-for-2024),
    warning that while AI will remain hot in 2024, inadequate silicon supply is likely
    to hamper wide-scale deployments.

  zh: 认证机构Uptime Institute在其最新的[分析](https://uptimeinstitute.com/resources/research-and-reports/five-data-center-predictions-for-2024)中回应了这些担忧，警告称，尽管人工智能在2024年仍将保持热度，但不足的硅供应可能会妨碍大规模部署。
- en: Funding a single fab project - let alone a network of facilities - won't be
    an easy or cheap endeavor. A single chip factory can cost anywhere from $10 billion
    to $20 billion, depending on the location and planned capacity. Intel's two fabs
    in Arizona are expected to cost $15 billion apiece, while TSMC expects its factory
    project, located nearby, to run to about $40 billion.

  zh: 资助一个单独的工厂计划-更不用说一个设施网络-都不是一件容易或廉价的事情。一家芯片工厂的成本可能会在100至200亿美元之间，这取决于地点和计划容量。英特尔在亚利桑那州的两家工厂预计将耗资每家150亿美元，而TSMC预计其位于附近的工厂项目将耗资约400亿美元。
- en: What's more, these facilities can take anywhere from four to five years to complete,
    assuming workforce shortages don't cause delays, as we've seen lately.

  zh: 更重要的是，这些工厂可能需要四到五年的时间才能完工，假如遇到人手短缺造成延误的话，就像我们最近所见到的那样。
- en: It doesn't appear that OpenAI is trying to get into the foundry game. Instead,
    it appears the plan is to funnel any funds raised into leading-edge chip manufacturers
    like TSMC, Samsung Electronics, and potentially Intel. In effect, OpenAI would
    be gathering up billions to get these fabrication giants churning out parts for
    artificial intelligence.

  zh: OpenAI似乎并不打算参与晶圆代工业务。相反，计划似乎是将筹集到的任何资金投入到像台积电、三星电子和可能的英特尔这样的领先芯片制造商中。实际上，OpenAI将聚集数十亿美元，让这些制造业巨头为人工智能生产零部件。
- en: TSMC is likely the prime candidate as Nvidia, AMD, and Intel's GPUs and AI accelerators
    are all manufactured in its plants. And, while Nvidia has previously used Samsung
    facilities for some of its last-gen parts, those components haven't relied as
    heavily on advanced packaging technology.

  zh: TSMC很可能是首选，因为Nvidia、AMD和英特尔的GPU和人工智能加速器都是在其工厂制造的。而且，虽然Nvidia以前曾在三星工厂生产一些上一代零部件，但这些零部件并没有如此大量地依赖先进的封装技术。
- en: While demand is expected to outstrip the supply of AI accelerators through much
    of 2024, it may not be a lack of fab capacity holding things up.

  zh: 尽管预计到2024年大部分时间AI加速器的需求将超过供应，但这可能不是晶圆厂产能不足导致的。
- en: Based on [comments](https://www.theregister.com/2023/09/08/tsmc_ai_chip_crunch/)
    made by TSMC chairman Mark Liu late last year, investing in advanced packaging
    facilities rather than additional foundry capacity may address supply bottlenecks
    faster.

  zh: 根据去年晚些时候台积电董事长刘德音的[评论](https://www.theregister.com/2023/09/08/tsmc_ai_chip_crunch/)，投资于先进封装设施而不是额外的晶圆厂容量可能更快地解决供应瓶颈问题。
- en: Liu said in September that TSMC has more than enough foundry capacity to keep
    up with AI chip demand, rather the holdup was a lack of chip-on-wafer-on-substrate
    (CoWoS) packaging capacity. The packaging tech is used to stitch together compute
    and high-bandwidth memory modules commonly found on AI accelerators.

  zh: 刘在九月份表示，台积电的晶圆厂容量已经远远超过了AI芯片的需求，问题在于缺乏芯片-晶片-基板（CoWoS）封装容量。这种封装技术用于连接计算和高带宽存储器模块，这些模块通常用于AI加速器。
- en: It's our understanding that these packaging facilities don't take quite as long
    to build and are considerably less costly. Last July, TSMC [announced](https://www.theregister.com/2023/07/26/tsmc_29b_chip_plant_taiwan/)
    an advanced packaging facility in Taiwan valued at $2.9 billion. TSMC says the
    facility should be fully operational in about three years.

  zh: 据我们了解，这些封装设施建设时间不会太长，成本也要低得多。去年七月，台积电[TSMC](https://www.theregister.com/2023/07/26/tsmc_29b_chip_plant_taiwan/)宣布在台湾建设一家价值29亿美元的先进封装设施。TSMC表示，该设施预计在约三年内完全投入运营。
- en: Considering this, we suspect Altman and his partners will need to invest in
    a combination of fabrication and packaging facilities, if they really want to
    address AI chip supply constraints. ®
