- en: At my first company, I internalized [the standard advice](https://www.paulgraham.com/corpdev.html?ref=harryglaser.com)
    to never think about M&A. The consensus was, and is, to just keep growing the
    business and good things will come. I did that, and I was lucky that good things
    did come in the form of [a $130M acquisition](https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/14/sisense-acquires-periscope-data-to-build-integrated-data-science-and-analytics-solution/?ref=harryglaser.com)
    that was mostly good news for the founders and employees, and pretty-solid-given-the-reality
    news for our investors.

  zh: 在我的第一家公司，我内化了[标准建议](https://www.paulgraham.com/corpdev.html?ref=harryglaser.com)——永远不要考虑M&A。共识是，只要继续发展业务，好事情就会发生。我那么做了，我很幸运，好事情确实发生了，以[1.3亿美元收购](https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/14/sisense-acquires-periscope-data-to-build-integrated-data-science-and-analytics-solution/?ref=harryglaser.com)的形式出现了，对创始人和员工们来说，大部分是好消息，对我们的投资者来说，在现实情况下也是相当扎实的消息。
- en: Having lived it, and having close friends who’ve lived it, I think the usual
    advice does founders a disservice. People often get into startups because of the
    chance for a pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. M&A is one of two ways a pot
    of gold happens. So rather than ignoring it, I think it’s worth understanding
    how it happens, and avoiding the dumb mistakes that make it not happen when you
    need it.

  zh: 通过自己的经历，以及有很多密友也经历过，我认为通常的建议对创始人是种伤害。人们通常加入初创公司是因为有机会在彩虹尽头找到一锅金。M&A是实现这一金饭碗的两种方式之一。因此，我认为，与其忽视它，不如了解它是如何实现的，并避免那些无谓的错误，这些错误可能造成您需要时无法实现这一目标。

    a big round anyway, stop and think about whether you really want to raise your
    hard floor right now. At Periscope Data, after a failed Series C process, we ended
    up selling at our Series B price. It’s tempting to think a Series C would have
    helped us get a better outcome. The opposite is true: In fact, we’re lucky the

    I get asked frequently why some founder of a late-stage, seemingly stalled business
    won’t sell. The answer is there are no buyers. This doesn’t mean the business

- en: '**You cannot generate an offer.** Offers are generated by events at the acquirer
    that will be mysterious to you, like splashy launches by a competitor, missed
    sales numbers, or internal reorgs. The adage that tech companies are bought, not

- en: '**The real reason for an offer is often optical.** Often, events at the acquirer

    isn’t innovating like they used to. The key decider needs a big, splashy move

    negotiating the price.'

- en: '**Negotiate everything you can in the LOI itself.** The LOI gives the acquirer
    exclusivity, thus eliminating all your leverage. To a first approximation, you
    will lose every battle after the LOI is signed. If you care about it, get it in
