    offer durable [sterilizing immunity](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9595357/)
    against Covid. A reasonable best-guess might be that each booster dose provides
    a 50/50 chance of sterilizing immunity that might last as little as six months
    — especially if major new variants emerge. In stark contrast, a single dose of
    the [HPV vaccine](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25420478/) provides a near-guarantee
    of sterilizing immunity that lasts at least a decade and effectively cross-protects
    you against related HPV variants that weren’t even in the vaccine. What accounts
    for the difference between these two vaccines? And why aren’t other vaccines more
    like the HPV vaccine?

    extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence (ECREE). In school, I was
    taught that ECREE is a bedrock principle of the scientific method — but several
    decades of life as a workaday scientist have taught me it’s actually *anti*-scientific.
    In my experience, ECREE is mostly used by privileged authorities who have fallen
    into the trap of mindlessly defending some hallowed bit of dogmatic orthodoxy.
    Dogma “everybody knows” but that nevertheless sometimes turns out to be disastrously
    wrong. The actual bedrock foundation of the scientific method is simple: claims
    require evidence, in a way that’s pretty much upside-down from ECREE. It’s equally
    important to require evidence for *ordinary* claims — such as the old [claim](http://law2.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/galileo/galileochronology.html)
    that everybody knows the Earth is at the center of the cosmos, or the modern [claim](https://medium.com/@buckcbb/cloth-masks-suck-d69e6092f05b)
    that everybody knows decorative cloth masks will protect us against Covid.'

    — particularly on the evidence side of the ledger. In 1808, Thomas Jefferson [rejected](https://www.monticello.org/research-education/blog/who-is-the-liar-now/)
    the extraordinary claim that the type of rocks we now call meteorites fall from
    the sky. Jefferson’s error was in his failure to recognize that [Jean-Baptiste
    Biot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Baptiste_Biot#Meteorites)’s comprehensive
    1803 survey of several thousand meteorites could reasonably have been viewed as
    extraordinary evidence. Similarly, climate denialists have spent the past half-century
    incrementally [moving the goalposts](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/7-answers-to-climate-contrarian-nonsense/)
    on what might constitute sufficiently extraordinary evidence of the inconvenient
    claim that human-made climate change is occurring.

    method has been the replication and extension of key findings by independent investigators.
    This is good, because other possible error-correction methods — such as peer review
    — are themselves highly error-prone. In 2009, peer reviewers for *Science* missed
    glaring clues that a retrovirus called [XMRV](https://www.science.org/doi/abs/10.1126/science.333.6050.1694)
    might be a lab artifact. Conversely, ECREE thinking led peer reviewers at *Journal
    of Virology* to reject the initial discovery of the actual human retrovirus [HTLV](https://www.pushkin.fm/podcasts/revisionist-history/the-obscure-virus-club).
    Independent experiments quickly uncovered the XMRV error and quickly confirmed
    the truth of HTLV. It’s a good thing we don’t rely on peer review to do all the
    heavy lifting.

    roots in an extraordinary hypothesis originally [proposed](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.8248784)
    by Bachmann and colleagues more than 30 years ago. The basic idea is that rigidly
    repetitive molecular structures — such as the repetitive surfaces of some types
    of virus particles — can reliably provide an exceptionally strong trigger for
    antibody-producing B cells. The exceptional performance of the HPV vaccine, which
    is composed of empty virus-like particles self-assembled from 360 copies of the
    HPV coat protein, is a spectacular fulfillment of Bachmann’s prophecy.

    has spent more than a decade doing its utmost to spread the repetitively arrayed
    vaccine gospel far and wide, but the message has vexingly never attracted widespread
    attention. To some extent, I suspect this reflects the perception that the success
    of the HPV vaccine is an extraordinary claim — so our audiences keep passively
    waiting for extraordinary evidence that the magic can be applied to other vaccines.
    Evidence that polyomavirus vaccines are [even better](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36764908/)
    than the HPV vaccine apparently still isn’t extraordinary enough.

    Phase I (safety) [trial](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04784767) of a
    vaccine developed by my friend [Kayvon Modjarrad](https://www.scientificamerican.com/podcast/episode/a-universal-coronavirus-vaccine-to-prevent-the-next-pandemic1/)
    at the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research. The Walter Reed vaccine arrays
    SARS-CoV-2 Spike proteins on a repetitive platform called ferritin. I was ejected
    from the trial when FDA officials dictated that people who had received the newly
    released Moderna or Pfizer vaccines couldn’t be allowed to volunteer. I found
    the regulatory edict incomprehensible. The key question a Phase I trial of a second-generation
    Covid vaccine needs to answer is whether the vaccine is safe to use as a booster
    dose. Excluding previously vaccinated individuals made the trial *less* scientifically
    useful — and it took many months to recruit heroically brave volunteers who were
    willing to refuse the approved mRNA vaccines and instead roll the dice on possibly
    getting a placebo in the trial. From news reports, I infer that the Walter Reed
    effort is currently stalled out at the stage of attracting the private venture
    capital required to proceed to Phase II/III (efficacy) trials. It’s deeply regrettable
    that Operation Warp Speed was terminated prematurely. I hope the new [Project
    Next Gen](https://erictopol.substack.com/p/project-next-gen-the-united-states)
    can help get Kayvon’s team back in the saddle.

    SKYCovione was authorized for use in South Korea in June 2022, but Korean regulators
    devastatingly hobbled it by only allowing it to be used as a first dose. There’s

    SKYCovione is safer and more effective than first-generation Covid vaccines, the
    FDA continues to enforce strict prohibition on the obviously superior product.
    Why? I suspect the insidious hand of ECREE is at work here too. The FDA generally
    relies on private for-profit companies to provide proof that the medicine they
    wish to sell is safe and effective. As illustrated by the trials I couldn’t enroll
    in, the agency has the power to micromanage minute details of trial design in
    a secretive behind-closed-doors process that’s ultimately enforced by the agency’s
    power to deny licensure. The FDA has apparently judged the evidence of the SKYCovione
    trials to be insufficiently extraordinary — perhaps because the trials were conducted
    in Korea, where the agency couldn’t micromanage their development. There’s no
    mechanism for appealing or overriding this *de facto* FDA veto — or even to simply
    get a clear public accounting of how the decision was reached. It’s pretty much
    the dictionary definition of “unaccountable.”

    The new category would make it possible to rule that a given vaccine has a well-documented
    safety profile and has clear evidence supporting the possibility that it realistically
    *might* be effective. People would then be allowed to choose the definite maybe
    product based on their own personal judgment. The new category would also be useful
    for things like the controversial new Alzheimer’s medicine [aducanumab](https://www.science.org/content/article/promising-alzheimer-s-therapy-and-related-drugs-shrink-brains).

    In an ideal scenario, the FDA budget would be boosted to a level where the agency
    could also serve the normal error-correction function of the scientific method
    — by independently testing vaccine products and conducting post-market monitoring.
    Having a Consumer Reports-like testing program would empower people to make better
    evidence-based decisions about which medicines they put in their own bodies. Some
    consumers might make foolish decisions, but that isn’t a reasonable justification

    my systolic blood pressure was 127, which is pretty good for a 50 year-old man.
    The research nurse scared me when she told me my diastolic pressure, which was
    87, indicated I was too unhealthy to meet FDA guidelines for participation in
    the trial. To my relief, a quick internet search revealed the guidelines are nonsense.
