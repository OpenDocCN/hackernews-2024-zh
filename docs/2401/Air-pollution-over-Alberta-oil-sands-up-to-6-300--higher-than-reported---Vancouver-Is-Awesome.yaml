    Alberta's oil sands were underreporting climate changing carbon emissions.

- en: Aircraft flying over Alberta’s oil sands have found emissions of organic carbon
    — a primary driver of air pollution — between 1,900 per cent and 6,300 per cent
    higher than industry has reported.

    according to the new study, led by Canadian federal scientists and published in
    the journal Science Thursday.

    Engineering and one of 24 co-authors of the study, said the previously unaccounted
    for emissions from the Athabasca oil sands were largely made up of volatile organic
    compounds overlooked in routine monitoring. He said they were surprised by the
    massive gap.

    for air quality and the environment,” said Gentner.

    is linked to major health and climate effects — and gases like ozone, a key component
    of smog and leading cause of pollution in Canadian cities.

    agriculture in East Asia up to US$63 billion a year, according to one 2022 [study](https://www.nature.com/articles/s43016-021-00422-6).

    in the region (e.g., Fort McMurray, Indigenous communities) to downwind impacts

    because it wasn’t looking at a diverse enough range of molecular sizes often associated
    with heavy oil and bitumen deposits. Such deposits are expected to account for
    40 per cent of global oil production by 2040, the study found.

    most of Canada’s oil production and a large share of its carbon pollution.

    released last April, some of the same researchers at Environment and Climate Change
    Canada used aircraft, satellite and historical data to reassess climate changing
    emissions from the oil sands.

    unreported carbon dioxide into the atmosphere every year — 65 per cent higher
    than industry reported.

    than reported in Canada’s National Pollutant Release Inventory, which is required
    the report the entire range of volatile organic compounds. That’s 13 per cent
    more than Canada’s entire annual output of organic carbon emissions.

    gas-phase organic carbon emissions, even when only including the facilities studied
    here.”

    would need to change if Canada were to accurately report the full air quality
    and environmental impacts of the oil sands operations.
