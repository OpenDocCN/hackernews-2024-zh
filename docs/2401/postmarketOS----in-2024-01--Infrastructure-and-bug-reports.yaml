- en: It's a new year, aaand of course that means we're all having big grandiose thoughts
    about our projects. postmarketOS is no different, and in pursuit of transparency
    and reflection we got inspired to write this very blog post about those plans
    and what has been happening recently.

- en: First things first, As you may know, we recently [launched on OpenCollective](https://opencollective.com/postmarketos),
    and WOW, the feedback has been honestly amazing. We on the core team definitely
    didn't expect this level of generosity, and we're hard at work finding the best
    ways to use this money to improve the sustainability and reliability of postmarketOS.
    OpenCollective let's us easily manage expenses, pay people for their work, and
    receive donations. With everything being 100% transparent. We're extremely excited
    for the autonomy that this gives us.

- en: We've been having a bit of a tough time with our infrastructure recently. So
    we decided to make use of some of the donated money to invest in a bigger, better
    and more reliable server and started to move services over. Towards the end of
    January the major bottlenecks should be resolved (we are working hard on it behind
    the scenes), and infrastructure should be nice and fast again.

    images totally separately to our other services to minimise the risk of *unplanned
    outages*.

- en: We will also eventually get a second dedicated server which will work as a CI
    runner. We currently benefit from GitLab.com's ("Free premium for Open Source
    projects"), without which it would not be possible to operate postmarketOS. While
    we are very grateful towards GitLab for this, it would be better if we didn't
    rely on it as GitLab may decide at any time to be not as generous in the future.
    Therefore we are continuing to reducing our dependency on such infrastructure.

    more main and community devices - where we provide prebuilt images - and leave
    us room for some other experiments we have in mind.

- en: Testing is one of the things that currently holds us back. We support so many
    devices with so many different configurations that making changes to some of our
    more core components (like the initramfs) is extremely difficult. The testing
    team [which you can join here](https://wiki.postmarketos.org/wiki/Testing_Team)
    helps a lot, but it's certainly understandable that folks may not want to test
    potentially risky changes, or some of the more boring housekeeping things. It
    can also be challenging to provide a good method for *how* to test some features
    (i.e. if it's not a codepath which is hit under normal usage).

- en: Writing a testing guide is always useful, but there's no reason we can't do
    better - we already have the wonderful `pmbootstrap ci` command which lets you
    run CI for most of our repos locally, and we plan to have proper automated testing
    eventually which will let us properly validate a lot of the most important things.

    mention to the Quartz64 which gained support in late November.

- en: We shipped [logbookd](https://git.sr.ht/~martijnbraam/logbookd), a very cute
    logging implementation which actually saves to storage(!!!), so you can retrieve
    logs from previous boots. It also adds well-needed coloured output, allows for
    some (slightly fuzzy) service filtering, and includes kernel logs by default.
    Thanks Martijn.

    an issue where syslog wasn't actually being enabled, resulting in both logbookd
    and openrc-syslog competing, oops!

    yes, this was a pretty bad lapse in testing to let this one through, and definitely
    a lesson learnt.

    devices so that the correct folks get notified about changes to their devices.
