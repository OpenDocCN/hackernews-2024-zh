    relentless campaign against Farnborough airport”. He was accused of “bombarding”
    the airport and relevant authorities “with endless questions about air traffic”,

    a point of view to suit his agenda”.

    any harassment, alarm or distress, nuisance or annoyance to any person” in Surrey
    or Hampshire, or face jail or a fine, or both.

    powered flight. But for most of its 120-year history, it operated as a military
    and civil aviation research centre. Experimental jets ripped through the skies
    over Hampshire – but during daylight hours only, and not at all at weekends.

    government agreed to Farnborough’s redevelopment for business aviation. Initially
    it began operations in 2000 with 28,000 flights a year, 2,500 of those at weekends
    and on bank holidays. In 2011, the government overruled the local councillors
    to increase the number of flights to 50,000 a year with 8,900 at weekends, but
    maintained weight limits that restricted heavier aircraft from using Farnborough.

    for business trips. It claims its proposals will support 4,100 jobs and add £470m
    to the UK economy by 2040\. And it insists its emissions are forecast to meet
    the UK’s net zero targets.

    event in Fleet, a Hampshire commuter town 45 minutes from London, Paul Whelan,

    the increased air traffic.

    Committee, which advises ministers on net zero goals, [reiterated](https://www.theccc.org.uk/publication/2023-progress-report-to-parliament/)
    there should be no airport expansion until the aviation industry started to cut
    its CO[2] emissions. Flying made up 7% of the UK’s total carbon emissions last
    year. And Farnborough’s critics say its emissions profile is particularly egregious.

    expansion is to increase the cap on weekend flights.” She claimed that although
    the airport sold itself as a centre for business aviation, many of its flights
    were for leisure purposes, and were taken by a small number of wealthy people.'

    group Possible](https://www.wearepossible.org/latest-news/jetting-away-with-it)
    found that half of Farnborough flights in the busiest summer months headed to
    the Mediterranean, rather than business locations, while a quarter of winter flights
    headed for Alpine destinations. In September a service launched specifically [to
    shuttle dogs and their owners](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/sep/30/private-jet-service-for-rich-dog-owners-condemned-by-climate-campaigners)

    the convenience of the customer profile, it’s not that every flight is for business
    reasons … It’s about facilitating the richest people to have a journey with the
    most convenience possible.”

    are now private jet flights, according to Possible. Planes using Farnborough airport
    carry an average of only 2.5 passengers per plane and 40% of aircraft fly empty.
    This means that, per passenger mile, those passengers are 20–40 times more polluting
    than a passenger doing the same journey on a commercial flight.

    decades due to market growth and displacement from other London airports, and

    direct control”.

    greater than those of a commercial airport, its economic output per passenger
