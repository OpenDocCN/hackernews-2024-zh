- en: The other constraint of the physical world is physics itself. The radio spectrum
    can carry only so many stations, and a coaxial cable so many TV channels. And,
    of course, there are only 24 hours a day of programming. The curse of broadcast
    technologies is that they are profligate users of limited resources. The result
    is yet another instance of having to aggregate large audiences in one geographic
    area—another high bar, above which only a fraction of potential content rises.

- en: 'The past century of entertainment has offered an easy solution to these constraints.
    Hits fill theaters, fly off shelves, and keep listeners and viewers from touching
    their dials and remotes. Nothing wrong with that; indeed, sociologists will tell
    you that hits are hardwired into human psychology, the combinatorial effect of
    conformity and word of mouth. And to be sure, a healthy share of hits earn their
    place: Great songs, movies, and books attract big, broad audiences.'

    somewhere, and the more we explore alternatives, the more we're drawn to them.
    Unfortunately, in recent decades such alternatives have been pushed to the fringes
    by pumped-up marketing vehicles built to order by industries that desperately
    need them.

- en: Hit-driven economics is a creation of an age without enough room to carry everything
    for everybody. Not enough shelf space for all the CDs, DVDs, and games produced.
    Not enough screens to show all the available movies. Not enough channels to broadcast
    all the TV programs, not enough radio waves to play all the music created, and
    not enough hours in the day to squeeze everything out through either of those
    sets of slots.

    whose barroom players offer more than 150,000 tracks—and some surprising usage
    statistics. He hints at them with a question that visitors invariably get wrong:
    "What percentage of the top 10,000 titles in any online media store (Netflix,
    iTunes, Amazon, or any other) will rent or sell at least once a month?"'

    that way. The 80-20 rule, also known as Pareto''s principle (after Vilfredo Pareto,
    an Italian economist who devised the concept in 1906), is all around us. Only
    20 percent of major studio films will be hits. Same for TV shows, games, and mass-market
    books—20 percent all. The odds are even worse for major-label CDs, where fewer
    than 10 percent are profitable, according to the Recording Industry Association
    of America.'

- en: But the right answer, says Vann-Adibe, is 99 percent. There is demand for nearly
    every one of those top 10,000 tracks. He sees it in his own jukebox statistics;
    each month, thousands of people put in their dollars for songs that no traditional
    jukebox anywhere has ever carried.

  zh: 但是，范-阿迪贝说的正确答案是99%。对于那前10000首热门曲目，几乎每一首都有需求。他在自己的点唱机统计数据中看到了这一点；每个月，成千上万的人们为从未在任何传统点唱机中播放过的歌曲投入他们的钱。
- en: People get Vann-Adibe's question wrong because the answer is counterintuitive
    in two ways. The first is we forget that the 20 percent rule in the entertainment
    industry is about *hits*, not sales of any sort. We're stuck in a hit-driven mindset—we
    think that if something isn't a hit, it won't make money and so won't return the
    cost of its production. We assume, in other words, that only hits deserve to exist.
    But Vann-Adibe, like executives at iTunes, Amazon, and Netflix, has discovered
    that the "misses" usually make money, too. And because there are so many more
    of them, that money can add up quickly to a huge new market.

  zh: 人们对范-阿迪贝的问题的答案误解了，因为答案在两个方面都是违反直觉的。首先，我们忘记了娱乐行业中的20%规则是关于*热门*，而不是任何销售额。我们被困在以热门为驱动的思维模式中——我们认为如果某事不是热门，它就不会赚钱，因此不会收回其制作成本。换句话说，我们假设只有热门值得存在。但是，范-阿迪贝和iTunes、亚马逊以及Netflix的高管们发现，“失败品”通常也会赚钱。由于它们的数量更多，这些钱很快就会积累成一个巨大的新市场。
