- en: This release of fish includes a number of improvements over fish 3.6.4, detailed
    below. Although work continues on the porting of fish internals to the Rust programming
    language, that work is not included in this release. fish 3.7.0 and any future
    releases in the 3.7 series remain C++ programs.

- en: The history pager will now also attempt subsequence matches ([#9476](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9476)),
    so you can find a command line like `git log 3.6.1..Integration_3.7.0` by searching

    if you’re already in a search ([#10005](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10005)).
    This makes it nicer to search something with `↑` and then later decide to switch
