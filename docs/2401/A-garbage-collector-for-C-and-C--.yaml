    conservative garbage collector can be used as a garbage collecting replacement
    for C `malloc` or C++ `new`. It allows you to allocate memory basically as you
    normally would, without explicitly deallocating memory that is no longer useful.
    The collector automatically recycles memory when it determines that it can no
    longer be otherwise accessed. A simple example of such a use is given [here](simple_example.html).
  prefs: []

- en: The collector is also used by a number of programming language implementations
    that either use C as intermediate code, want to facilitate easier interoperation
    with C libraries, or just prefer the simple collector interface. For a more detailed

    replacing `malloc` with `GC_malloc` calls, replacing `realloc` with `GC_realloc`

    based on this one. It was once available from `http://www.yl.is.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp/gc/`
    Their collector takes advantage of multiple processors during a collection. Starting
    with collector version 6.0alpha1 we also do this, though with more modest processor
    scalability goals. Our approach is discussed briefly in [`scale.html`](scale.html).
    The collector uses a [mark-sweep](complexity.html) algorithm. It provides incremental
    and generational collection under operating systems which provide the right kind
    of virtual memory support. (Currently this includes SunOS[45], IRIX, OSF/1, Linux,
    and Windows, with varying restrictions.) It allows [*finalization*](finalization.html)
    code to be invoked when an object is collected. It can take advantage of type
    information to locate pointers if such information is provided, but it is usually
    used without such information. ee the README and `gc.h` files in the distribution
    for more details.

    package that provides for fast concatenation and substring operations on long

    as a cord is included as a sample application.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Performance of the nonincremental collector is typically competitive with malloc/free
    implementations. Both space and time overhead are likely to be only slightly higher
    for programs written for malloc/free (see Detlefs, Dosser and Zorn's [Memory Allocation
    Costs in Large C and C++ Programs](ftp://ftp.cs.colorado.edu/pub/techreports/zorn/CU-CS-665-93.ps.Z).)
    For programs allocating primarily very small objects, the collector may be faster;
    for programs allocating primarily large objects it will be slower. If the collector
    is used in a multithreaded environment and configured for thread-local allocation,
    it may in some cases significantly outperform malloc/free allocation in time.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We also expect that in many cases any additional overhead will be more than
    compensated for by decreased copying etc. if programs are written and tuned for
    garbage collection.
