    UART, and more. Figure out how a chip works before writing a line of code.

- en: Bus Pirate 5 comes with [extra button caps](https://hardware.buspirate.com/enclosure/hardware?ref=buspirate.com#dyed-plastic-button-caps).
    A color master at a clothing accessory factory dyed white caps to match red, yellow
    and blue retro arcade buttons.

- en: We also tried a hydrographic dip dye factory and made button caps with a carbon
    fiber pattern.

- en: A silkscreen on the main IO header clearly marks the pinout for faster and easier
    connections. This tricky job was done by an Uncle who specializes in silkscreens
    on wireless ear pods.

- en: Bus Pirate 5 is sealed with a “genuine” quality assurance "[Scratch and Sniff"
    sticker](https://hardware.buspirate.com/manufacturing/packaging/genuine-sticker?ref=buspirate.com).
    Our custom scent was too thin to be encapsulated and printed, but the factory
    helped us thicken it with a common cosmetics material.

- en: We tried to make the ultimate [probe cable](https://firmware.buspirate.com/overview/probe-cable?ref=buspirate.com)
    with really nice silicone coated wire. Leads are labeled and color coded. 2.54mm
    DuPont crimps work with lots of common, less expensive [test probes](https://firmware.buspirate.com/overview/probehooks?ref=buspirate.com).

- en: A pogo pin factory made precision [milled breadboard adapter pins](https://hardware.buspirate.com/cables/milled-pins?ref=buspirate.com)
    for the probe cable. One side fits the probe cable, the other inserts into a breadboard
    or female header. Tiny but handy!

- en: An [auxiliary cable](https://firmware.buspirate.com/overview/aux-cable?ref=buspirate.com#auxiliary-connector-cable)
    connects the Bus Pirate to external tools like a logic analyzer. It’s difficult
    to tell the tiny wires apart, so we found white crimp housings and dyed them to
    match the probe cable.

- en: After months of delays and thousands of rejects, the [injection molded enclosure](https://hardware.buspirate.com/enclosure/injection-molded-shell?ref=buspirate.com)
    is done! The final batch is beautiful, but plastic creep in the insert nuts sent
    us scrambling to find non-standard 7mm bolts.

- en: A last-minute change from an SD card to NAND flash storage left a gaping hole
    in the enclosure. It was far too late to change the tooling, so we SLA 3D printed
    a tiny plug to fill the unused slot.

- en: Sometimes you want to connect a wire and go, so we made a Bus Pirate [KF141
    quick connect adapter](https://firmware.buspirate.com/overview/quick-connect?ref=buspirate.com).
    A pinout silkscreen in bright orange matches the KF141 levers.

- en: RPi Pico is great, but the tiny misaligned pin labels are not. We asked Uncle
    to silkscreen the [Pico pinout on 20p headers](https://dirtypcbs.com/store/designer/details/ian/6637/raspberry-pi-pico-header-with-silkscreen-labels?ref=buspirate.com)
    when we sent KF141s. We picked the best header out of 10 manufacturers and used
    a two-part silkscreen process that's extra sharp.

- en: Custom boxes have big MOQs and take up loads of space. Bus Pirate 5 is packed
    in a highly recyclable brown box, then wrapped with a custom bento box takeaway
    label. This kind of printing is cheap, looks great, and has super low minimum
    quantities.

- en: Thank you for following along these past few months. Now, I'll resume building
    out the firmware and packing in features. There's several JTAG things in the pipeline,
    man in the middle attacks, [@MoonbaseOtago](https://twitter.com/MoonbaseOtago?ref=buspirate.com)'s
    oscilloscope, and more.
