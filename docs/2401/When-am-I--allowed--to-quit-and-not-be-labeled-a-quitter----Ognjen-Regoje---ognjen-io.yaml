    One that keeps raising bridge rounds but whose valuation stagnates.

    it counts as a legitimate attempt and that failure is not just them quitting when

    to continue.

    indications that you’ve failed. Plenty of counter-examples exist, but if you find
    yourself at one of these points, in my opinion, it’s perfectly reasonable to decide
    that you don’t want to continue.)

- en: If you’ve spent two years building the product and haven’t been able to switch
    to full-time and/or haven’t been able to close seed funding, to me at least, that’s
    a very strong indicator that you should re-evaluate.

    you won’t raise seed - several dozen if you’re an engineer with no sales or public
    speaking background. Even then, you should consider if you just suck at pitching
    and if you need to bring in a business co-founder.

    it might also be worth reconsidering.

    full-time and with external funding and you did not achieve 1M ARR yet, it’s time
    to re-think.

    a great deal about an industry and running a company and have had enough time
