- en: The medieval history of England and France was a close – if complicated – one,
    especially for elites. England’s royalty and nobility were deeply entwined with
    French lands, people and culture even in the early Middle Ages, long before the
    Norman Conquest of 1066\. Contacts between the courts and clergy of England and
    Francia were frequent and significant. One of Charlemagne’s last descendants to
    be king of West Francia – the predecessor kingdom to France – grew up in the court
    of his uncle, King Æthelstan of Wessex in the tenth century.
