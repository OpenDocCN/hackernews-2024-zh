# Post Office accused of cover-up over secret Horizon documents - BBC News

That followed advice from lawyers Linklaters that they had only "very limited liability in relation to financial redress".

The minutes show the committee asking for a paper to brief them on making "token payments" to sub-postmasters applying to the mediation scheme, trumpeted in public at the time by ministers as a solution to sub-postmasters' complaints.

"The cost of all cases in the scheme going to mediation would be in the region of £1m," the unredacted minutes state.

Members of the committee knew sub-postmasters wouldn't be happy and that there was a "real risk" that "many applicants will remain dissatisfied at the end of the process".

On 30 April 2014, following advice from Chris Aujard, the committee decided not to make any "ex gratia" payments - meaning payments to struggling sub-postmasters to help them while their cases were examined.

They also asked for a paper to be prepared on options for closing or speeding up the mediation scheme.

Second Sight's interim report in 2013 did say that it had found no systemic flaws in the Horizon system. But the word "systemic" had a specific meaning - that no flaws could be found in every single post office branch.

What the Post Office didn't say was that it also made an unwelcome finding, identifying incidents where defects or bugs in the Horizon software "gave rise to 76 branches being affected by incorrect balances or transactions which took some time to identify and correct".

On 17 December 2014, Jo Swinson, the former Liberal Democrat MP who served as Postal Affairs minister in the coalition government at the time, answered a parliamentary debate on the scandal. She pointed to the independent role of Second Sight.

The following year, in March 2015, as it prepared to submit its full report, 11 months after the decision had been taken, Second Sight's contract was terminated and the Post Office brought investigation of the sub-postmasters' cases in-house.

Lord Arbuthnot, a former MP and vocal critic of the handling of victims in this scandal told the BBC that the government has to take responsibility "for everything that went wrong" in relation to the sub-postmasters.

"It's a distinctly corrupt, murky story that goes right the way into government and it's deeply worrying," he said.

The prime minister's spokesperson said on Friday it was "right" that there was an inquiry ongoing and pointed out that the reports related to a previous administration.

"It is for the inquiry to establish culpability and to look at what lessons have to be learned. For the government's part we are co-operating and supporting the inquiry fully," the spokesperson added.

Alice Perkins and Paula Vennells didn't respond to requests for comment.

Linklaters also did not comment.

Chris Aujard and Richard Callard said through public relations advisers that they would not comment while the inquiry was ongoing.

UK Government Investments declined to comment.

Jo Swinson said: "The latest revelations about the Project Sparrow meetings and decisions show the extent of the cover-up by Post Office Ltd - they were kept secret from Parliament and the public, and from ministers too.

"Not only did the Post Office directors, including the government official, choose not to tell ministers, they instead briefed the opposite. Repeatedly they told me that Post Office Ltd had never seen anything that would undermine any of their prosecutions, something that we now know is simply not true."

A Post Office spokesperson said: "We never discuss individuals and it would be inappropriate to comment on allegations being made outside of the Inquiry, whose role it is to consider all of the evidence on the issues it is examining and independently reach conclusions.

"We fully share the Public Inquiry's aims to get to the truth of what happened in the past and accountability."
