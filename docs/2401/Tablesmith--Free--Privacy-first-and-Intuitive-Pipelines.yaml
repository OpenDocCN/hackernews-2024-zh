    column, and data extraction. You can combine these to form highly complex pipelines.
    All stage types are easy to understand and configure. You can add them in seconds,
    and with the powerful formula editor, you can write formulas using columns and
    variables. Another cool feature is that you can publish your pipeline as a web
    app. Check out the demos below; they are all real pipelines.'

    or [tracks.xlsx](https://tablesmith.io/app/assets/assets/tracks.xlsx)). Clicking
    any pipeline will take you to its shared page where you can simply click **Run**
    and select the downloaded file. Curious about the pipeline’s inner workings? Just
    click the **Clone** button.
