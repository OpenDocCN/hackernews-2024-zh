    who have experienced menopause gets osteoporosis (the disease that comes after
    prolonged and untreated osteopenia), which is characterized by porous bones that
    can easily fracture. The Osteoboost belt is designed to prevent bone density from
    reaching that stage through early intervention. It works by mechanically stimulating
    the strength of the bones in the hips and spine of a wearer and prevents the further
    progression of bone density disintegration. The blueprint for the technology comes

- en: The belt should be worn for 30 minutes every day or at least five times a week
    for it to fully take effect. It delivers a gentle vibration that makes it easy
    to be worn pretty much anywhere or at any time, such as during dog walks or while
    washing dishes. During clinical trials, CT scans showed that following the integration
    of the belt into a patient’s care plan, bone density visually improved over time.
    [In a study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10555262/) backed by
    the NIH, women aged 50 to 60 lost 3.4 percent of their bone density by the end
    of 12 months without any intervention, while patients who wore the belt lost only
    0.5 percent of their bone strength.

    frequent weight-bearing exercises and reducing the risk of falls. “Although lifestyle
    interventions such as exercise and diet are beneficial to bone, the effect is

    told Engadget that the belt will be “affordable and accessible to the millions

    Technology said it is currently in talks with insurers regarding coverage for
