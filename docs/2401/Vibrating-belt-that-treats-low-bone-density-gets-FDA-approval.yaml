    has [provided clearance](https://www.bonehealthtech.com/news/press-release/1007/)
    for a medical device called [Osteoboost](https://www.bonehealthtech.com/#osteoboost),
    a vibrating belt that improves bone density in patients with [osteopenia](https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/dont-be-bad-to-the-bone-how-to-preserve-bone-mass).
    The device, which was developed by California-based startup Bone Health Technologies
    and in part [with NASA](https://www.bonehealthtech.com/science/), is the first
    medical device of its kind to get regulatory approval as a treatment option for
    postmenopausal women.'

    who have experienced menopause gets osteoporosis (the disease that comes after
    prolonged and untreated osteopenia), which is characterized by porous bones that
    can easily fracture. The Osteoboost belt is designed to prevent bone density from
    reaching that stage through early intervention. It works by mechanically stimulating
    the strength of the bones in the hips and spine of a wearer and prevents the further
    progression of bone density disintegration. The blueprint for the technology comes
    from [NASA](https://www.engadget.com/the-morning-after-nasa-finally-shows-whats-inside-its-bennu-asteroid-container-121523420.html)

- en: The belt should be worn for 30 minutes every day or at least five times a week
    for it to fully take effect. It delivers a gentle vibration that makes it easy
    to be worn pretty much anywhere or at any time, such as during dog walks or while
    washing dishes. During clinical trials, CT scans showed that following the integration
    of the belt into a patient’s care plan, bone density visually improved over time.
    [In a study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10555262/) backed by
    the NIH, women aged 50 to 60 lost 3.4 percent of their bone density by the end
    of 12 months without any intervention, while patients who wore the belt lost only
    0.5 percent of their bone strength.

- en: Current standards of care for preventing osteoporosis during the osteopenia
    stage are mostly [lifestyle suggestions](https://theros.org.uk/information-and-support/osteopenia/)
    that can be hard to adhere to, such as a well-balanced and calcium-rich diet,
    frequent weight-bearing exercises and reducing the risk of falls. “Although lifestyle
    interventions such as exercise and diet are beneficial to bone, the effect is
    small. The Osteoboost shows promise in slowing the loss of bone density and strength
    and may fill the treatment gap,” Laura Bilek, a researcher who has studied the
    belt’s effectiveness [said](https://www.biospace.com/article/releases/bone-health-technologies-announces-fda-clearance-of-osteoboosttm-the-first-prescription-medical-device-to-treat-low-bone-density/).

- en: Osteoboost is still not yet available for sale, but you can sign up to get notified
    when the [device is released.](https://www.bonehealthtech.com/#contact-2) A company
    representative said they will begin shipping later this year and will accept pre-orders
    in the next few months. While the price is also still not disclosed, the representative
    told Engadget that the belt will be “affordable and accessible to the millions
    of patients who need it.” To get the device, you will need a prescription from
    your doctor — so pricing may vary depending on insurers and co-pays. Bone Health
    Technology said it is currently in talks with insurers regarding coverage for
    the medical device. While the price projection could have drastically changed,
    three years ago the CEO Laura Yecies told *NS Medical Devices* she believed the
    device could debut for [about $800](https://www.nsmedicaldevices.com/analysis/using-vibration-to-prevent-osteoporosis/).
