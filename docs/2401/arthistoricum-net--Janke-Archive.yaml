- en: Karl Hans Janke grew up as an only child in a lower middle-class family. After
    graduating from high school (Abitur) in 1941, he entered military service, which
    he was forced to end in 1943, due to his poor health.

    "delusional inventing" and drawing were attributed, meant that he would remain
    in clinical care for the rest of his life – a time period of nearly 40 years,
    which resulted in the production of more than 4,000 drawings and models of Janke’s
    visionary flying objects, as well as other inventions of his.
