    with the objectively slower, more austere transportation options of horses and
    sail boats. With the passage of time, minivans with bumper stickers and [Hyundai](https://fortune.com/company/hyundai-mobis/)
    Sonatas eclipsed trusty ole steeds. But a funny thing happened along the way,
    as wealthy hobbyists turned dressage and rowing into status symbols of a life
    of leisure spent mastering the old ways. Could the world of work be the same?

  zh: 在汽车领域充满车牌大赛和丰田马拉松的日子之前，美国人只能选择马匹和帆船这两种明显更慢、更朴素的交通工具。随着时间的流逝，带有保险杠贴纸和[现代](https://fortune.com/company/hyundai-mobis/)Sonata的面包车超过了可靠的老骥。但在这个过程中发生了一件有趣的事情，富有的爱好者将马术和划船变成了一种生活休闲的地位象征，花费时间掌握古老的方式。工作世界可能也会有同样的变化吗？
- en: In 2020, remote work was every bit as revolutionary as the technologies of the
    horse or the boat, and in an accelerated version of the transportation revolution,
    it’s rapidly shaping up as a commodity that the wealthy save for themselves.

- en: Just a few years after most knowledge workers shifted to remote work, it’s now
    mostly wealthy, college-educated employees who are still being allowed to work
    from home, according to a newly released poll from [Ipsos Consumer Tracker](https://www.ipsos.com/en-us/news-polls/consumer-behavior-time-covid-19).
    The survey of 1,110 adults, conducted in mid-January, further supports a conclusion
    that the labor market has split into separate groups, based on one’s sector, pay,
    and location.

  zh: 在大多数知识工作者转向远程工作几年后，现在大部分还允许在家工作的是富有的、受过大学教育的雇员，根据[益普索消费者跟踪器](https://www.ipsos.com/en-us/news-polls/consumer-behavior-time-covid-19)最新发布的调查显示。这项调查在一月中旬进行，对1110名成年人进行了调查，进一步支持了一个结论，即劳动力市场已经分裂成不同的群体，根据一个人的行业、薪水和地点而定。
- en: “During the pandemic, we saw dramatic disruptions to the world of work—the first
    in a generation,” Clifford Young, president of polling and society at Ipsos, tells
    *Fortune*. “Some white-collar workers—who tend to be wealthier and college degree
    holders—rapidly switched to remote work. The disruptions and discrepancies the
    pandemic produced are still with us today and are reflected in the data.”

  zh: “在疫情期间，我们看到了对工作世界的巨大干扰——这是一代人以来的首次，”益普索民意测验和社会调查部门主席克利福德·杨告诉《财富》杂志。“一些白领工作者——他们往往更富有并拥有学士学位——迅速转向了远程工作。疫情产生的干扰和不一致性至今仍然存在，并反映在数据中。”
- en: While a whopping 63% of employees that make $100,000 or more report being able
    to work from home sometimes or always, only 38% of those making $50,000 to $100,000
    have the same benefit. That number dwindles to only 32% for workers making under
    $50,000\. People with higher education are also more likely to be able to work
    hybrid or remotely (between 59% for those with college degrees and 41% for those
    without).

    sure that the boat still stays afloat for them. In other words (despite narratives

    to crop up, as only 32% of employees in rural areas are able to work from home
    at least partially. That’s compared to 48% of city dwellers and 55% of suburbanites.

- en: Just like the shadows of pandemic behavior still fall over your behavior (e.g.,
    how you might glare at someone coughing in the subway), it also clouds our workforce.
    Almost four years after COVID-19 first hit, many workers [continue to search](https://fortune.com/2023/10/23/office-workers-remote-work-over-money-quit-jobs/)

- en: Meanwhile, the blue-collar field has made some gains in terms of stability and
    pay this past year, notably with UAW winning a [record-breaking contract](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2023/11/12/fain-uaw-contract-wins/)
    for its members from Detroit’s Big Three automakers. These employees aren’t usually
    able to work from home, sacrificing their health even during the height of the
    pandemic. Over in the service industry, many used their leverage to get better
    paying jobs and quit during the Great Resignation as conditions became too stressful.
    It seems as if now, even if they can’t work remotely, these employees are in a
    less precarious position.

- en: 'One thing appears to become clear: The chasm between the sectors in the workforce
    is likely to only get wider. “Looking ahead to the future, the differences between
    white-collar professionals—who tend to have more opportunity to work from home
    in some capacity—and blue-collar workers—who tend not to have that same flexibility
    baked into their roles—may widen the gaps between the haves and have-nots,” adds

    Young补充道。
