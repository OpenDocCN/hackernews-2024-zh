- en: In the earliest days of a startup, there are almost no rules and processes.
    Nonetheless, as soon as the first few employees join, the risk of data breaches,
    phishing, or getting [pwned](https://haveibeenpwned.com) is increasing.

    to keep these early days'' speed as long as possible. Therefore, I created a minimal
    set of rules that are easy to digest for everybody but can significantly reduce
    the most relevant IT security risks. From my experience, the more elaborate these
    kinds of rules are formalized, the less likely that they are read or even adhered
    to. Therefore, I did my best to boil it down to 10 simple rules for all team members:'

    a company license. Save all company-related sensitive information (passwords,
    credit card data, bank accounts, etc.) in that account. Don’t save such information
    anywhere else.

    that offers 2FA. Sync OTPs using the password manager. Never reveal OTPs on the
    phone, not even to colleagues or superiors (phishing alert!). The password manager
    will show you automatically for which services you can enable 2FA and have yet
    to do so.
