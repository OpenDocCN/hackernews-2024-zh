- en: I  have a pretty long history with Sweden and its language. Actually, until
    1961, when I was 16, I’d never given any thought to Sweden at all, but everything
    shifted on a dime when my Dad shared the 1961 Nobel Prize in Physics. That December,
    our family flew to Stockholm for the ceremonies and it was unforgettable. Not
    only were the solemn, yet deeply joyous, festivities a once-in-a-lifetime occurrence,
    but I was powerfully struck by the classic European beauty of Stockholm in the
    midst of that romantically dark and snowy Scandinavian winter—such a clean and
    sophisticated city with its old-fashioned trams, its glittering neon signs, its
    colorful store windows, its elegant ladies and gentlemen, and, last but not least,
    its strange, alien language.

- en: 'When, one day in the Grand Hôtel, which certainly lived up to its name, our
    family first laid eyes on my Dad’s Nobel diploma, colorfully and exquisitely hand-calligraphed
    in Swedish, I tried to make some sense of the citation—“*För hans banbrytande
    undersökningar över elektronspridningen mot atomkärnor och därvid* *gjorda* *upptäckter
    rörande nuckleonernas struktur*”—but I couldn’t do much with it. Although I knew
    a weensy bit of German, I didn’t know a word of any of its cousin languages, such
    as Swedish. And yet I instantly noticed something that looked odd; a tiny little
    thing that, to my eye, stuck out like a sore thumb. Even if you know zero Swedish,
    I urge you to try to spot the spot that was an eyesore to me. Hint: it’s just
    one word toward the end. And by the way, in English, what those italicized words
    mean is this: “For his pathbreaking investigations of electron-scattering from
    atomic nuclei, and for his discoveries, made thereby, concerning the structure
    of nucleons*.*”'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Okay, I’ll reveal what made me scratch my head. I knew my Dad’s research was
    all about atomic nuclei and their constituents—nucleons—and I was pretty sure
    that the Swedish word for “nucleon” wouldn’t have a “ck” in it, but either just
    a “k” or a “c.” I didn’t know what the final five letters of “*nuckleonernas*”
    meant, but that was irrelevant. So, in a mixture of worry and befuddlement, I
    pointed out this questionable spelling to my parents, who of course didn’t know
    what to make of it either. Later I asked some Swedes and found out that my intuition
    had been right; the calligrapher had simply made a blunder. It *should* have said
    “*nukleonernas struktur*”—literally, “the nucleons’ structure”—with just a “k,”
    not a “ck.” So, amusingly enough, my Dad’s Nobel diploma has a special distinction,
    making it very rare, like a postage stamp with a misprint.

    I was feeling restless and, for various reasons, I got the urge to go to Sweden.
    I had a couple of acquaintances in the old university town of Lund, in southern
    Sweden, near Malmö, so I contacted them and they urged me to come. And so I did,
    in early January of 1966\. I wound up living in a student dormitory in Lund for
    about three months and loving it immensely. I made some lifelong friends during
    that time: Ingemar Börjesson, Birgitta Ohlsson, and Bengt Olle Bengtsson. With
    them all, I of course spoke English, but from the very start I tried to learn
    to speak Swedish. I quickly found the language exceedingly alluring, with its
    curious tonal lilt and its very striking initial consonant-clusters—such as “kv,”
    “gj,” and “stj”—and of course its unique letters “å” and “Å.” But nearly everyone’s
    English ran rings around my attempts at Swedish, so it was very hard to get my
    foot, or even my toe, in the door. One day, however, by luck I met a young Swedish
    woman on my floor of the dormitory who was very timid about speaking English.
    She tolerated my stumblings-about in Swedish, so somehow a few conversations with
    her became *min tå* in the door, and then they became *min fot* in the door. After
    a while I found a few other Swedes who were willing to speak Swedish with me,
    and from there on I was off and running.'

    students, and became close to the Lawaczeck family, who lived in the Stockholm
    suburb of Kungsängen. Even after all these years I’m still friends with Yvonne
    (“Mon”) Lawaczeck Seifert. And with the Lawaczecks I spoke almost exclusively
    Swedish all the time, and that gave a *huge* boost to my Swedish. However, I lived
    in Sweden for only six months total during that year abroad, and in the late summer
    of 1966 I returned to America to go to graduate school. And with that, my love
    affair with the Swedish language—or at least my *first* love affair with it—was
    over, alas.

    Sweden and its language. What turned the trick was a tempting invitation I received
    to participate in a small symposium that June in Stockholm, called “The Limitations
    of Scientific Knowledge.” My old memories of Stockholm and of course of Swedish
    were so vivid that I couldn’t resist accepting.

    and, on the last evening, he invited a few of us to his home for dinner. It was
    a lovely occasion and, when Christer found out that I knew some Swedish and loved
    the language, he presented me with a thick book he had recently written, entitled
    *Upplysning för det tjugoförsta århundradet* (Enlightenment for the Twenty-First
    Century). As he handed it to me, he said, “It’s written in very simple Swedish,
    so I’m sure you’ll have no trouble reading it.” Well, what Christer meant by “very
    simple Swedish” was that it wasn’t written in an obscure dialect, wasn’t a trove
    of medieval poetry, and wasn’t a technical treatise on toads’ skin diseases, or
    something equally opaque. The truth was, it was written in very flowing, normal,
    even sophisticated Swedish. But that was just fine with me. On my return flight,
    I flipped through it and tried to read some of it, and found it both fascinating
    and fun. As soon as I got home, I sent Christer an email offering to translate
    his whole book into English. Kind of a crazy idea, but why not? Christer was thrilled
    and, over the next couple of years, that’s exactly what I did. It was a true labor
    of love, and soon the plunge I’d taken had fully revived my long-dormant love
    for Swedish.

    My wife Baofen and I decided to spend our year in four marvelous cities in four
    different countries, immersed in four different languages, one right after the
    other: the fall in Vienna, Austria (German); the winter in Uppsala, Sweden (Swedish);
    the spring in Hangzhou, China (Mandarin); and the summer in Geneva, Switzerland
    (French). It was an amazing year, to say the least, and while in Uppsala I drenched
    myself once again in Swedish. I did my utmost to speak Swedish with people around
    me—especially Anders Andersson, Gunilla Borgefors, Ulf Danielsson, Lars Oestreicher,
    and Christer Sturmark—even though these were all people who spoke nearly perfect
    English and certainly way, way above my level of Swedish. But somehow, they all
    very kindly indulged me and I will never forget the many hours I spent speaking
    Swedish with these sparkling and warm people. It was a second love affair with
    the Swedish language and a high point in my life.'

    did virtually nothing to improve my Swedish and so of course it started fading.
    I felt very sad about that, but I had so many other things I was involved in that
    I just couldn’t keep it up. But a few months ago, for some unclear reason, I felt
    an urge to read some of the dozen or so books in Swedish that I had acquired in
    Uppsala. And so I tackled one, and then another, and then another, and another,
    including two collections of short stories written by Tove Jansson—the Swedish-speaking
    Finnish author who wrote many famous children’s stories about the “Moomintrolls,”
    as they are always called in English. Right now I’m in the midst of reading a
    very stimulating book about genetics and politics written by my old friend from
    my Lund days, Bengt Olle Bengtsson.

    Each page takes between 6 and 26 minutes, usually around 10, with lots and lots

    is filled to the brim with ambiguities that make it far from perfectly phonetic—and
    the very careful writing of scads of marginal notes.

    has been roiling and boiling in that language—in its sounds, words, idioms, spelling,
    grammar and so on—and a few days ago, to my great surprise, I found myself randomly
    making up fake-Swedish words and phrases. This silly and pointless but very playful
    activity amused me a lot, so on a lark I decided to sit down at my computer and
    have some fun for a while. In an hour or so, I wound up producing a paragraph
    that was chock-full of nonsense words that looked and sounded very Swedish—at
    least to me!—but that, taken all together, meant absolutely nothing.

    pronouns, the conjunctions meaning “and” and “or,” the articles meaning “the”

    words. All the nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs were fictitious—just products
    of my fantasy. However, I used standard prefixes and suffixes in order to make
    the past tenses of verbs, the plurals of nouns, agents and actors based on verbs,
    adverbs from adjectives, and such things. In that sense, it’s very much like Lewis
    Carroll’s immortal nonsense poem “Jabberwocky”: “’Twas brillig, and the slithy

    first, that was good enough for me. But then it suddenly hit me that I might feed
    the paragraph to my old frenemies Google Translate and DeepL, just to see what
    they would do with it. These are two of today’s flagship machine-translation programs
    and, although—or perhaps *because*—these programs have improved by leaps and bounds
    over the past few years, I greatly enjoy discovering and poking fun at their many
    unpredictable weaknesses. Little did I suspect how enormously much those oh-so-earnest
    engines’ poker-faced “translations” of my nonsense paragraph would crack me up.
    When I read their respective outputs, I found myself rolling on the floor. Their
    wacky jabber was a riot! And then my friend David Moser threw the highly touted
    Chinese translation engine Baidu into the mix, which added even more humor.

    be a whole bunch of misspelled Swedish words. It then strung together a set of
    corresponding real English words, without having the least notion that the text
    it was ingesting and the text it was spewing out were both totally devoid of meaning,
    though in vastly different ways. None of these three world-class machine-translation
    systems had the slightest awareness of being engaged in a marvelously funny GIGO

    Jabberwocky. That is to say, a passage made up of lots of nonexistent funny-sounding
    “English” nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs stitched together into a grammatical-sounding
    text with the help of short genuine English words such as “the,” “a,” “but,” “and,”
    “or,” “with,” “I,” “we,” “he,” and standard prefixes like “un-,” “dis-,” “re-,”
    “con-,” and standard suffixes like “-s,” “-er,” “-ed,” “-ly,” “-ing,” “-tion,”
