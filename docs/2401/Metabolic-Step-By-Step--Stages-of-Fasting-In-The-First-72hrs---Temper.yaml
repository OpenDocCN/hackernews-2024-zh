    has stopped being associated exclusively with religion and protest and taken on
    a connection with an impressive list of health benefits including improved mood,
    increased energy, sharper focus, and even clearer skin.

    But like the intelligent person you are, you first want to find out as much as
    you can about what fasting will do to your body and how it’ll make you feel.

- en: There are a lot of different types of intermittent fasting. In some configurations,
    you’ll fast for no more than 12 hours. And on the upper limit of the timespan
    of fasting recommended for casual, less experienced fasters, is the 72-hour (3-day)
    fast, which is long enough to be considered an extended fast. As you go deeper
    into a fast, the effects stack.
  prefs: []

- en: Most of us have gone 12 or 16 or even 24 hours without eating at least a few
    times in our lives just out of necessity or coincidence, but it’s much less common
    for people to fast for three days unintentionally. So for this article, we’ll
    focus on what happens with your energy, metabolism, and general response to a
    72-hour fast.

    is a stored form of glucose, a type of sugar you get from the carbohydrates you
    consume. When you digest your food, your body breaks down carbohydrates into glucose,
    which it stores as glycogen in the muscles and liver. As long as you have glycogen
    stored up, that’s what your body will use to give it the energy to function.

    will rise, telling your body to break down glucose for energy. But after 12 hours
    of fasting, your insulin will drop. A hormone called leptin, which is responsible
    for telling you you’re full, will also fall, while ghrelin, the hormone that signals
    hunger, will rise.

    stores. Once that happens, your body needs to turn to an alternative source of
    fuel.

- en: About four hours after you’ve stopped eating, your body will use a process called
    lipolysis for energy. Lipolysis breaks down the triglycerides – a type of lipid
    – in your fat cells to use a source of fuel. It will also break down amino acids
    (the compounds that form proteins) for energy.
  prefs: []

    will transition into a state called ketosis, which is when it starts relying on
    fat as its primary form of energy. In the process of breaking down fat for fuel,
    your body will release ketones, or molecules that your liver produces from fatty
    acids.

    resistance, something that can happen as a result of having prolonged high levels
    of insulin, can lead to diabetes. In contrast, insulin sensitivity, which is what
    happens when you fast, can help you have a healthier [body fat percentage](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19904628),
    reduce inflammation, and activate further autophagy, the benefits of which you’ve

    it is important to note that fasting for more than 24 or 48 hours is a serious
    undertaking that should be done carefully and ideally under medical supervision.

    you stay as safe as possible.

    to deprive it for that long of electrolytes, which help you remain hydrated. To
    maintain your electrolyte levels, you can take an electrolyte supplement or consume
    salt in your water.
