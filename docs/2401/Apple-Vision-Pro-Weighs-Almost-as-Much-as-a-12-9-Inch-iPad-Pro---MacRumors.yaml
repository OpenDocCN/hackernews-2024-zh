- en: The weight of Apple's headset was unknown until today, but it was widely rumored
    to be heavy compared to competing devices. This is not necessarily the case, since
    while the Meta Quest 3 weighs 18.2 ounces (516 grams), the higher-end Meta Quest
    Pro weighs 25.5 ounces (722 grams) – substantially more than the Vision Pro. However,
    the Meta Quest Pro has a weighted battery pack at the back of the headset's headband
    to make it much less front-heavy and ostensibly improve comfort.

    a bug that caused old photos that were deleted to reappear in the Photos app.
    Apple quickly released an iOS 17.5.1 update to fix the issue, but for many users,
    its explanation of "database corruption" in the release notes was all too brief,
    and did little to allay concerns about the privacy of their data. Apple ...
