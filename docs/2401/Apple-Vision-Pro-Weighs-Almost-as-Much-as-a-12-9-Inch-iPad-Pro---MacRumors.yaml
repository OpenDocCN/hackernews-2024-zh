- en: The weight of Apple's headset was unknown until today, but it was widely rumored
    to be heavy compared to competing devices. This is not necessarily the case, since
    while the Meta Quest 3 weighs 18.2 ounces (516 grams), the higher-end Meta Quest
    Pro weighs 25.5 ounces (722 grams) – substantially more than the Vision Pro. However,
    the Meta Quest Pro has a weighted battery pack at the back of the headset's headband
    to make it much less front-heavy and ostensibly improve comfort.
