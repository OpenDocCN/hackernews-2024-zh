    from taking off in the US. And the problem for Boeing is that it’s another body
    blow in a long series of problems in the past few years. Remember when two of

  zh: 是的，对于这家飞机制造商来说，情况看起来不妙。我们必须问一下——波音究竟是怎么了？
- en: Well, it probably all began in the [summer of 1997](https://qz.com/1776080/how-the-mcdonnell-douglas-boeing-merger-led-to-the-737-max-crisis?utm_source=email&utm_medium=Quartz_Daily_Brief_Asia&utm_content=1851147566).

  zh: 嗯，这可能都始于[1997年夏天](https://qz.com/1776080/how-the-mcdonnell-douglas-boeing-merger-led-to-the-737-max-crisis?utm_source=email&utm_medium=Quartz_Daily_Brief_Asia&utm_content=1851147566)。
- en: Boeing wanted to establish dominance and show the world who was boss in the
    airline industry. So it decided to acquire another plane manufacturer called McDonnell
    Douglas. It was a massive merger worth $14 billion.

  zh: 波音想要建立统治地位，向世界展示谁才是航空工业的老大。因此，它决定收购另一家飞机制造商麦道公司。这是一次价值 140 亿美元的大规模合并。
- en: Now after the merger, the new entity retained the Boeing name. It was expected
    since it was Boeing that splashed the cash. But the problem was that the culture
    of McDonnell Douglas seeped in. And that changed the face of Boeing completely.

  zh: 现在合并之后，新实体保留了波音的名称。这是意料之中的，因为是波音在出资。但问题是麦道公司的文化渗透了进来。这完全改变了波音的面貌。
- en: See, the Boeing of the pre-merger era was called an ‘engineers’ company’. The
    ones who made these flying machines called the shots. Costs didn’t matter and
    it was only quality and design that did. They wanted to ensure that only their
    best ideas took to the skies. Safety was paramount. And the [Chief Financial Officer](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/11/how-boeing-lost-its-bearings/602188/%5C)
    who was answerable to Wall Street about costs didn’t care much about trying to
    impress the bankers either.

  zh: 你看，合并前的波音被称为‘工程师公司’。制造这些飞行器的人说了算。成本不重要，唯有质量和设计才是关键。他们希望只有他们最好的想法才能飞上蓝天。安全至关重要。而对于要向华尔街负责成本的首席财务官也不怎么在意试图给银行家留下深刻印象。

- en: The CEO of McDonnell Douglas actually became the CEO of Boeing. A chairman with
    no aviation background, but who’d worked in General Electric, was also appointed.
    The company started paying attention to creating shareholder value which was hardly
    a priority earlier. And as one article put it, “Now, a passion for great planes
    was replaced with a passion for affordability.” Boeing even turned to [outsourcing](https://hbr.org/2014/06/the-price-of-wall-streets-power)
    critical operations. Sure, it made the balance sheet ‘asset light’, but, it came
    at the cost of quality.

    Douglas bought Boeing with Boeing’s money.” But it was a harmless observation.

    to place an order with Boeing’s rival Airbus. Airbus had created the A320neo which
    was more fuel-efficient. And while initially, Boeing scoffed at Airbus, the call
    from American Airlines was a jolt out of the blue. That’s when Boeing realised
    it had fallen behind.

- en: But it didn’t have time on its hands to innovate and build something from scratch.
    And that’s when the McDonnell Douglas way of doing things caught on — instead
    of spending $20 billion on a new plane, Boeing budgeted a [puny $2.5 billion](https://ethicsunwrapped.utexas.edu/engineering-ethics-and-the-boeing-scandal)
    and decided to tweak its iconic 737\. Technical drawings for the model were being
    churned out at double the pace, workers from other departments were pulled in
    for the Max project, and timely delivery took precedence over quality. The idea
    was to make small but significant changes to 737 while sticking to the original
    design so that pilots wouldn’t really have to be retrained either.

    2014, Boeing’s CEO never mentioned safety even once in their annual statement.
    And we all know what happens when ethics and quality fly out of the window!

    have loose bolts that could be dangerous. It said that one of its suppliers drilled
    holes in the wrong places for some jets. And it even stumbled in its quest to
    build the US President’s new Air Force One.

    best-selling plane in Boeing’s history. And 76% of the company’s outstanding order
    book involves variants of these aircraft. And it’ll be a tough task to convince
    people that Boeing has not forgotten how to build an aeroplane.
