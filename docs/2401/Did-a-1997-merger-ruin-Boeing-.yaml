    from taking off in the US. And the problem for Boeing is that it‚Äôs another body
    blow in a long series of problems in the past few years. Remember when two of
    its Max airlines plummeted to the ground in 2018 and killed hundreds of people
    on board?

    airline industry. So it decided to acquire another plane manufacturer called McDonnell
    Douglas. It was a massive merger worth $14 billion.

- en: Now after the merger, the new entity retained the Boeing name. It was expected
    since it was Boeing that splashed the cash. But the problem was that the culture
    of McDonnell Douglas seeped in. And that changed the face of Boeing completely.

- en: See, the Boeing of the pre-merger era was called an ‚Äòengineers‚Äô company‚Äô. The
    ones who made these flying machines called the shots. Costs didn‚Äôt matter and
    it was only quality and design that did. They wanted to ensure that only their
    best ideas took to the skies. Safety was paramount. And the [Chief Financial Officer](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/11/how-boeing-lost-its-bearings/602188/%5C)
    who was answerable to Wall Street about costs didn‚Äôt care much about trying to
    impress the bankers either.

- en: The CEO of McDonnell Douglas actually became the CEO of Boeing. A chairman with
    no aviation background, but who‚Äôd worked in General Electric, was also appointed.
    The company started paying attention to creating shareholder value which was hardly
    a priority earlier. And as one article put it, ‚ÄúNow, a passion for great planes
    was replaced with a passion for affordability.‚Äù Boeing even turned to [outsourcing](https://hbr.org/2014/06/the-price-of-wall-streets-power)
    critical operations. Sure, it made the balance sheet ‚Äòasset light‚Äô, but, it came
    at the cost of quality.

    Douglas bought Boeing with Boeing‚Äôs money.‚Äù But it was a harmless observation.

    to place an order with Boeing‚Äôs rival Airbus. Airbus had created the A320neo which
    was more fuel-efficient. And while initially, Boeing scoffed at Airbus, the call
    from American Airlines was a jolt out of the blue. That‚Äôs when Boeing realised
    it had fallen behind.

    And that‚Äôs when the McDonnell Douglas way of doing things caught on‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääinstead
    of spending $20 billion on a new plane, Boeing budgeted a [puny $2.5 billion](https://ethicsunwrapped.utexas.edu/engineering-ethics-and-the-boeing-scandal)
    and decided to tweak its iconic 737\. Technical drawings for the model were being
    churned out at double the pace, workers from other departments were pulled in
    for the Max project, and timely delivery took precedence over quality. The idea
    was to make small but significant changes to 737 while sticking to the original
    design so that pilots wouldn‚Äôt really have to be retrained either.

    2014, Boeing‚Äôs CEO never mentioned safety even once in their annual statement.
    And we all know what happens when ethics and quality fly out of the window!

    have loose bolts that could be dangerous. It said that one of its suppliers drilled
    holes in the wrong places for some jets. And it even stumbled in its quest to
    build the US President‚Äôs new Air Force One.

    best-selling plane in Boeing‚Äôs history. And 76% of the company‚Äôs outstanding order
    book involves variants of these aircraft. And it‚Äôll be a tough task to convince
    people that Boeing has not forgotten how to build an aeroplane.
