- en: These days, children begin making digital footprints before they can walk—voracious
    tech companies even snap up data [before children are born](https://thereader.mitpress.mit.edu/tech-companies-are-profiling-us-from-before-birth/).
    So when my first child came into the world, my wife and I decided to try to keep
    our baby’s name, face, and personal details off the internet.

- en: I didn’t want a photo of my kid hoovered into an AI training dataset, or have
    their name and birth date germinate an ad targeting profile. Future friends, partners,
    and employers shouldn’t be able to Google their childhood photos. My child needs
    to learn to read “Goodnight Moon” before they can tackle a [privacy policy](https://themarkup.org/hello-world/2023/08/05/the-one-page-on-every-website-that-tells-you-the-truth).

- en: In practice, this means my wife and I made no public birth announcement. Instead,
    we sent private messages to friends and family. We have tried to avoid posting
    our baby’s name, photo and birth date, especially all three in one location where
    they can be easily associated with each other.

- en: Complicating our efforts, our child does not share a last name with either my
    wife or me. We gave our child a different last name to avoid picking either of
    our surnames or a lengthy compound name.

- en: 'A side-effect of the new surname is additional privacy: our child’s first and
    last name is a truly unique combination. We’ve tried to avoid putting it out into
    the world where we can. At the moment, a Google search for their full name returns
    zero results.'

    we haven’t cut ourselves off from the digital ecosystem entirely. My child’s name
    sits in insurance company databases, daycare registration forms, and cloud storage
    servers. That Google search? It means Google now has at least one record of my
    kid’s name associated with me.

    truly off-grid is impossible. But I hope our efforts will obscure our child’s
    digital trail and help them choose when, how, and how much to share.
