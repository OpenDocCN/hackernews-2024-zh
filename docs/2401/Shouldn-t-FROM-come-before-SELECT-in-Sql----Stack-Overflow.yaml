- en: Do you take SELECT-FROM-WHERE for granted, or do you, like me, find it rather
    curious that the System R team should have spurned the normal way of writing expressions
    of arbitrary complexity in favour of something utterly idiosyncratic and, one
    might say, rather dictatorial...?

- en: The fact is that in the 1960s various scripting languages (as we tend to call
    such things these days) had come about for the purposes of report generation,
    especially ad hoc report generation. We had one such language in the prerelational
    DBMS called Terminal Business System (TBS) that I worked on for IBM from 1969-77\.
    Our language required the user to specify the required report in a series of steps
    that had to be given *in the prescribed order*...

- en: A somewhat similar but much more sophisticated report generator was later developed
    by IBM in the US, as part of a product called (prosaically, as was IBM's style
    in those days) Generalized Information System (GIS)... when I first looked at
    SQL, my immediate reaction was "Oh no! Son of GIS? Please not that!" I might have
    been quite wrong about this. The similarity I perceived might have been illusory
    and even if it was not, I have no firm evidence that anybody in the System R team
    was familiar with GIS. The fact remains that the general style of a fixed order
    of actions was the order of the day at the time. I postulate that SQL's SELECT-FROM-WHERE
    arose out of this fashion.
