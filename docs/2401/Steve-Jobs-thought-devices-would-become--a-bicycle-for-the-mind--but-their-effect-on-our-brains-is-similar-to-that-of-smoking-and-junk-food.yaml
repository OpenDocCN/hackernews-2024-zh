    a [bicycle for the mind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L40B08nWoMk). In those
    years, the advent of the smartphone and the mass adoption of social media have
    turned those bicycles into runaway trains. Americans spend more than four hours
    a day on their smartphones–and [more than half say they are addicted to their
    device](https://www.reviews.org/mobile/cell-phone-addiction/). In May 2023, the
    surgeon general [issued a warning](https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2023/05/23/surgeon-general-issues-new-advisory-about-effects-social-media-use-has-youth-mental-health.html)
    about the concerning effects of social media on youth mental health.

    a recurring challenge across various domains. From the obesity epidemic spurred

    on the heels of access to easy credit, history is replete with examples of such
    misalignments. However, the trend in U.S. cigarette smoking provides a promising
