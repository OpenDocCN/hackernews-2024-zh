    a [bicycle for the mind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L40B08nWoMk). In those
    years, the advent of the smartphone and the mass adoption of social media have
    turned those bicycles into runaway trains. Americans spend more than four hours
    a day on their smartphones–and [more than half say they are addicted to their
    device](https://www.reviews.org/mobile/cell-phone-addiction/). In May 2023, the
    surgeon general [issued a warning](https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2023/05/23/surgeon-general-issues-new-advisory-about-effects-social-media-use-has-youth-mental-health.html)
    about the concerning effects of social media on youth mental health.
