what3words does not aim to replace street addressing. Rather, it is a useful addition when street addresses are not accurate enough, and an instant, scalable solution where addresses do not exist.

Compared to current street addressing systems, 3 word addresses are far more accurate, as they refer to a specific 3m x 3m area. As the entire what3words grid is fixed, the 3 word address for a particular location will never change even if buildings or streets are redeveloped.

3 word addresses are unique, unlike street names which are often duplicated, and they are easier to communicate and share with others.

what3words is much faster to set up and more cost-efficient than any regular street addressing system, as every 3 word address has already been pre-assigned, providing an instant, scalable solution.

what3words is the only addressing system optimised for voice, making it the ideal location system for the voice-enabled solutions of the future.

what3words AutoSuggest prompts intelligent suggestions based on the user’s location, making it a truly human friendly solution.
