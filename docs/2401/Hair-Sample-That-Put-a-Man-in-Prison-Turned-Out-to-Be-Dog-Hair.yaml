- en: Kate Judson is a lawyer who often deals with crimes that did not occur. As the
    executive director of the Wisconsin-based [Center for Integrity in Forensic Sciences
    (CIFS)](https://cifsjustice.org/#/main), her job is to examine ostensible scientific
    evidence to see whether it backs up prosecutors' claims.

    really the victim of illness, or accident, or suicide, or medical error—that kind
    of thing," says Judson. "We had a case of a family that lost their child. The
    caregiver was accused of attacking her. It was later discovered, based on new
    medical evidence, that the child had been really ill with a disease she was probably
    born with."'

    out of jail. And it can give a grieving family some peace of mind. To learn that
    your child "was held and comforted in their last moments, instead of attacked,"
    says Judson, "would be important to know."

    that fired the bullet.'

    a D.C. Superior Court judge ruled that a ballistics expert could not testify that
    a gun discarded by Marquette Tibbs near a crime scene was indisputably the source
    of the casings found there. Why not? Because the ballistics field is really shaky,
    the judge determined, and lacks "validity."

    report about forensic science](https://www.ojp.gov/pdffiles1/nij/grants/228091.pdf)
    "and that really marked a turning point in the birth of the forensic reform movement,"

    experts and legal experts and said, ''Let''s talk about what they''re saying in
    court and whether it passes scientific muster.''"'

    evidence, says Judson. But other comparisons of color and texture, even examined
    under the microscope, have led to many wrongful convictions. She points to the
    case of Santae Tribble, convicted of murder at 17, despite evidence that he had
    been elsewhere when the crime occurred.

    chance that the hair found on a stocking mask at the crime scene belonged to someone

    involved a woman raped, beaten, bitten, and stabbed to death in Wisconsin in 1984\.
    A dental scientist named Lowell Thomas Johnson said the marks came from someone
    missing a tooth. When a neighbor, Robert Stinson, was questioned—and seen missing
    a tooth—he was charged with murder. The bite marks were the only evidence against
    him.

    of the saliva and blood on the victim's sweater. These didn't belong to Stinson.
    Instead, they belonged to another prisoner, Moses Price, who was serving 35 years
    for committing a subsequent murder. Price confessed, and Stinson was exonerated.

    alligator scales?" asks Judson. "It''s called ''alligatoring." Until recently,
    it was considered an indicator of arson.'

    Judson says. "It's a pattern of breakage that they used to say came from arson.
    But after, again, real scientific experimentation, it turns out that that happens
    when hot glass gets water poured on it."
