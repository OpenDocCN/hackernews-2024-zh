- en: Kate Judson is a lawyer who often deals with crimes that did not occur. As the
    executive director of the Wisconsin-based [Center for Integrity in Forensic Sciences
    (CIFS)](https://cifsjustice.org/#/main), her job is to examine ostensible scientific
    evidence to see whether it backs up prosecutors' claims.

  zh: Kate Judson是一位经常处理并未发生的犯罪的律师。作为位于威斯康星州的[司法科学诚信中心（CIFS）](https://cifsjustice.org/#/main)的执行董事，她的工作是检查表面上的科学证据，看看它是否支持检察官的主张。
- en: '"Some people who died were classified as victims of homicide when they were
    really the victim of illness, or accident, or suicide, or medical error—that kind
    of thing," says Judson. "We had a case of a family that lost their child. The
    caregiver was accused of attacking her. It was later discovered, based on new
    medical evidence, that the child had been really ill with a disease she was probably
    born with."'

- en: Evidence can't bring a child back, obviously. But it can get an innocent person
    out of jail. And it can give a grieving family some peace of mind. To learn that
    your child "was held and comforted in their last moments, instead of attacked,"
    says Judson, "would be important to know."

    a D.C. Superior Court judge ruled that a ballistics expert could not testify that
    a gun discarded by Marquette Tibbs near a crime scene was indisputably the source
