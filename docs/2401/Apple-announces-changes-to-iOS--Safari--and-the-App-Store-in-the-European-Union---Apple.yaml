- en: CUPERTINO, CALIFORNIA Apple today announced changes to iOS, Safari, and the
    App Store impacting developers’ apps in the European Union (EU) to comply with
    the Digital Markets Act (DMA). The changes include more than 600 new APIs, expanded
    app analytics, functionality for alternative browser engines, and options for
    processing app payments and distributing iOS apps. Across every change, Apple
    is introducing new safeguards that reduce — but don’t eliminate — new risks the
    DMA poses to EU users. With these steps, Apple will continue to deliver the best,
    most secure experience possible for EU users.

- en: The new options for processing payments and downloading apps on iOS open new
    avenues for malware, fraud and scams, illicit and harmful content, and other privacy
    and security threats. That’s why Apple is introducing protections — including
    Notarization for iOS apps, an authorization for marketplace developers, and disclosures
    on alternative payments — to reduce risks and deliver the best, most secure experience
    possible for users in the EU. Even with these safeguards in place, many risks
    remain.

    will become available to users in the 27 EU countries beginning in March 2024.

    in the European Union, while helping to protect EU users from the unavoidable
    increased privacy and security threats this regulation brings. Our priority remains
    creating the best, most secure possible experience for our users in the EU and
    around the world,” said Phil Schiller, Apple Fellow. “Developers can now learn
    about the new tools and terms available for alternative app distribution and alternative
    payment processing, new capabilities for alternative browser engines and contactless
    payments, and more. Importantly, developers can choose to remain on the same business
    terms in place today if they prefer.”

    Safari, and the App Store as “core platform services” under the Digital Markets
    Act. In March, Apple will share new resources to help EU users understand the
    changes they can expect. That includes guidance to help EU users navigate complexities
    the DMA’s changes bring — including a less intuitive user experience — and best
    practices for approaching new risks associated with downloading apps and processing
    payments outside of the App Store.

    contain scams, fraud, and abuse, or that expose users to illicit, objectionable,

    security, and quality of the iOS user experience in the EU as much as possible.
    For instance, App Tracking Transparency will continue to work with apps distributed
    outside of the App Store — asking a user’s permission before a developer tracks
    their data across apps or websites. However, the DMA’s requirements mean that
    App Store features — including Family Purchase Sharing and Ask to Buy — will not
    be compatible with apps downloaded from outside of the App Store.

    browser from a list of options.

    their payment information with additional parties, creating more opportunities
