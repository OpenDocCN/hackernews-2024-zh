- en: 'Commercial and industrial applications like lighting require large-scale, low-power
    device networks where thousands of devices need to communicate with one another
    efficiently, reliably and securely. Commissioning and maintenance of such networks
    must also be easy and efficient in order to reduce the total cost of ownership.
    Bluetooth mesh 1.1 is the latest edition on the Bluetooth SIG’s mesh networking
    standard and it introduces a plethora of new features addressing the needs and
    challenges of large commercial networks including for example: standardized OTA
    updates, remote provisioning, certificate-based provisioning and directed forwarding.
    Silicon Labs is one of the key contributors to the development and implementation
    of Bluetooth mesh standard.'
