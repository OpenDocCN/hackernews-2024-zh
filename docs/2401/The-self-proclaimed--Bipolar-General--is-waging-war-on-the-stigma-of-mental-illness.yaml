    Brigade that paved the way to Baghdad from Kuwait. He led from the front, aggressively,
    pushing his troops with relentless positivity. In his downtime he favored intense
    workouts over sleep. His mania fit right in with the American military mystique.
    His superiors gave him almost nothing but praise.

    At a post-deployment health screening he spoke openly about depression. The nurse

    it''s hard to do because I''m depressed. I listen to really intense rock-and-roll

    I drink a lot, way more than I ever have in my life,'' " said Martin. "And they
    said, you''re fine, there''s nothing wrong with you."'

    and politicians going public about their struggles with mental illness. And the
    military has changed its approach to mental health in the 20 years since Martin''s
    tour in Iraq. But many in the military still fear a mental health diagnosis could
    derail their careers. That''s one reason Martin has written a memoir called *Bipolar
    General: My Forever War with Mental Illness*. Experts in the field credit Martin
    with helping to break down the military taboo on getting help.'

    career rewards aggressive, daring behavior. Unfortunately, the intensity of that

    intense cycles from mania to depression. All the while, his manic side just looked
    like high performance to his military superiors, who kept promoting him. By the
