- en: For those who live in countries where there are plenty of abandoned railways,
    a popular way to explore them has been by means of home made rail carts. These
    are usually rudimentary rail trolleys with a small internal combustion engine,
    and a host of fascinating videos of them can be found online. Such a trolley has
    one disadvantage though — it’s not the most compact of devices. [Cato] has come
    up with a rail cart that’s extremely portable by [replacing the engine with the
    guts of a pair of hoverboards](https://tech.cato.cat/railkart.html).

    plywood. The wheels are the stock hoverboard wheels with flat flanges applied,
    which while they don’t have the ideal flange profile of a rail wheel are good
    enough to keep the thing on track. Finally to control the thing a rather stylish
    little 3D printed single-axis joystick serves as a combined throttle and brake.

    ripped up can only gaze in envy and imagine speeding along the rails on one of
    these. The build starts with a warning never to use one of these on an active
    track, but should you wish to drive a real train [there are plenty of places to
    do that](https://hackaday.com/2016/03/04/rescuing-the-worlds-first-preserved-railway/).
