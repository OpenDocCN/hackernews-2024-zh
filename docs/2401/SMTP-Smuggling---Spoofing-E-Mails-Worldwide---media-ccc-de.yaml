- en: Introducing a novel technique for e-mail spoofing.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: SMTP, the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol, allows e-mailing since 1982\. This
    easily makes it one of the oldest technologies amongst the Internet. However,
    even though it seems to have stood the test of time, there was still a trivial
    but novel exploitation technique just waiting to be discovered – SMTP smuggling!

- en: In this talk, we’ll explore how SMTP smuggling breaks the interpretation of
    the SMTP protocol in vulnerable server constellations worldwide, allowing some
    more than unwanted behavior. Sending e-mails as admin@microsoft.com to fortune
    500 companies – while still passing SPF checks – will be the least of our problems!

- en: From identifying this novel technique to exploiting it in one of the most used
    e-mail services on the Internet, we’ll dive into all the little details this attack
    has to offer. Therefore, in this talk, we’ll embark on an expedition beyond the
    known limits of SMTP, and venture into the uncharted territories of SMTP smuggling!
