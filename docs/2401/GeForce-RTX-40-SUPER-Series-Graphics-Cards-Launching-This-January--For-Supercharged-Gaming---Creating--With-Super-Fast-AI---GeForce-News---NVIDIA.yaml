- en: In *Alan Wake 2, Cyberpunk 2077,* and *Portal with RTX*, players can immerse
    themselves in fully ray traced visuals even with every other setting cranked to
    the absolute max. It is 1.4X faster than the RTX 3080 Ti without frame generation,
    in the most graphically intensive games. With 836 AI TOPS, DLSS Frame Generation
    delivers an extra performance boost, making the RTX 4080 SUPER twice as fast as
    an RTX 3080 Ti.
