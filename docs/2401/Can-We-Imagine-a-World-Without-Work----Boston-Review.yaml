    sudsy water pouring over her specially treated furniture. Clean water would then
    wash the soap away, before draining from the gently sloped floors. Blasts of warm

    of Man Under Socialism” (1891), Oscar Wilde envisages a world in which “the machine”
    is made to “work for us in coal mines, and do all sanitary services, and be the
    stoker of steamers, and clean the streets, and run messages on wet days, and do
    anything that is tedious or distressing.” But Wilde gives little thought to the
    soul of *woman* under socialism. While the machine frees men from “that sordid
    necessity of living for others,” it does not lend a hand with the laundry, or
    feeding the baby. Even in the age of the machine, it seems, women are mopping
    up after others.

    in charge of the hospital, the nursing home, or the kindergarten. A world where
    no one spends tedious hours on the assembly line is a world worth aspiring to.

    grammar is that of alienation. Under this rubric, the true badness of work under
    capitalism—traditional wage labor and unpaid reproductive labor alike—lies in
    its distortion of our practical natures. When we fashion the world in accordance
    with our freely chosen ends, we realize ourselves within it. We exercise a key
    human capacity: the capacity to make ourselves objective. But under capitalism,
    we are not free to choose and pursue our own ends; we are forced into projects
    that we value only instrumentally. We mop floors, deliver packages, or babysit
    not because we think these activities have value in and of themselves, but because
    we need the money. We act on the world, yes, but we cannot properly express ourselves

    composing just for the sake of it—laboring with “the most damned seriousness,
    the most intense exertion.” (Here Hester and Srnicek quote the Marx of the *Grundrisse*.)
    Even dull, menial, and repetitive activities may enter into this “realm of freedom”
    when they are a constitutive part of appropriately valued projects. “Laboring
    over a hot stove,” Hester and Srnicek write, “can take on the quality of being
    a freely chosen activity in the arc of a larger self-directed goal.” Hester and
    Srnicek, then, are not advocating indolence. For them, the problem with work is

    of capitalism, one that appeals to values. Despite Lafargue’s title, with its

    a “crisis theory” of capitalism: a form of critique that appeals not to moral
    damage but rather to capitalism’s structural instability. Capitalism, says the

- en: 'The roots of crisis, for Lafargue, lie in the inevitable mismatch between the
    productive capacities of a capitalist society and that society’s capacity to consume
    what is produced. Capitalism, he thinks, requires that workers play two roles:
    they need to make things, but they also need to buy them. Eventually, these two
    roles will come into conflict. Suppose that a commodity is overproduced, so that
    its supply outstrips demand. Its price will fall. To compensate, factory owners
    will cut costs or slow production. And that means they will pay their workers
    less or lay them off. Consumer demand will then further contract, incentivizing
    further wage cuts, which will further suppress demand. Worker and capitalist will
    both be trapped in an ever-tightening fist of economic dysfunction.'

    production; workers should simply work less. Thus, Lafargue posits not so much
    a right to be lazy as a duty. Those who shirk it are to blame for overproduction.
    “The proletarians,” he writes, “have given themselves over body and soul to the
    vices of work [and so] they precipitate the whole of society into those industrial
    crises of overproduction that convulse the social organism.” (This haughty tone

- en: This argument makes for an unusual brand of crisis theory. Most crisis theorists
    trace overproduction to structural features of the capitalist economy. This underpins

    Value* (1863), to “drive production to the limit set by the productive forces
    . . . without any consideration for the actual limits of the market.” Insofar
    as overproduction is sufficient for crisis, then, it will also be “in the nature
    of capital” to undermine its own productive capacity. For Lafargue, by contrast,
    overproduction is not a structural necessity but a function of working-class myopia.

- en: Lafargue doesn’t worry that suppressing production will lead to scarcity. If
    the proletariat do manage to withhold their labor, he thinks, then laziness will
    become not a duty but a default. If workers work less, industrial equipment will
    be developed more quickly to compensate; and this trend will eventually result
    in a post-scarcity, post-work idyll. And Lafargue is at best impressionistic as
    to what life in such a world might be like. The niceties of (say) institutional
    design are quite beyond his ken. This marks a third point of contrast between
    Lafargue’s essay and *After Work*. Lafargue is primarily focused on the pathologies
    of industrial capitalism and on how they might be overcome. *After Work*, by contrast,

    demands that social hierarchies like those of race and gender be dismantled. Fraser
    notes that each of these forces is politically ambivalent. The family and the
    welfare state are iron fists as well as velvet gloves: they can offer protection,
    but they also discipline those who break its rules. Marketization breeds vulnerability,
    but it can also offer a route to freedom. You might, like me, prefer for your
    material security to depend on your earning power than on your ability to keep

    separatist communities of second wave feminism—the landdyke commune, the Oregon-based
    “WomanShare”—participants dug ditches, converted livestock outbuildings into homes,
    and went in for low-tech farming. Under different conditions, such work could
