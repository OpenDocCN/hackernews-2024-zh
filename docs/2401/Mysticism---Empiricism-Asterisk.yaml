    in a small prayer room in the basement of Boston University’s Marsh Chapel waiting
    for the drugs they’d just taken to kick in. Ten had been given an active placebo,
    ten had been given 30 milligrams of psilocybin, a drug they were otherwise told

    niacin, which in large doses triggers the dilation of capillaries close to the
    skin. Though uncomfortable, the niacin flush dissipated within an hour. By that

    a radical empiricist, held that experience is the foundation of knowledge. He

    spontaneously induced, achieved through prayer, solitude, or privation, or occasioned

    pioneering the use of LSD in therapy. Early initiates like Aldous Huxley described
    experiences on psychedelics that appeared to match those of historical mystics.
    And in the scientific study of mystical states, psychedelic drugs offered some
    advantages. They reliably produced an altered state of consciousness. They could

    LSD 的先河。早期的探索者如奥尔德斯·赫胥黎描述了在迷幻药物下的经历，这些经历似乎与历史上的神秘主义者相匹配。在对神秘状态的科学研究中，迷幻药物提供了一些优势。它们可靠地产生意识上的改变。它们可以被测量、给药且能被盲目使用。而且

    heavily on the work of the Princeton philosopher W.T. Stace — who was heavily

    spiritual traditions across culture and time shared a unifying core. His 1960
    book *Mysticism and Philosophy* surveyed mystical experience across religions
    to identify its common elements. With Stace’s exposition as a guide, Pahnke identified
    nine: ineffability, transience, and noetic quality were retained from James. To
    these, he added feelings of unity; transcendence of time and space; deeply felt
    positive mood; sacredness; paradoxicality; and persisting positive changes in

    its own paradox. How can timelessness or paradoxicality, for instance, be quantified?
    But Pahnke ignored the metaphysics. For each of the nine categories, Pahnke developed
    a list of questions and put them all in what was then called the “post-drug questionnaire.”
    His intuition was that each element existed on a continuum, where one’s experience,
    for example, of *having known the universe in its wholenes*s, one’s *sense of
    ultimate goodness as the basis of reality*, or one’s judgment that the *sense
    of the experience cannot be adequately described in words* could simply be scored

    differences in the mystical experience between the groups on each element. Pahnke
    considered the experiment strong evidence that psychedelic and religious mystical
    experience were indistinguishable, and that “psilocybin, if not LSD and mescaline

  zh: 科学冒险进入这个领域是荒谬的；我认为这是任何记者或学者在客观地考虑他们自己的经验时必须面对的挑战。“我们尽可能地玩好科学游戏，” 理查兹说。“但我们不要太认真。”如果在我自己的致幻使用中有一个一致的教训，那就是我默认的倾向于分析，尽可能地玩好科学游戏，这在我的日常工作中效果很好，但在关于如何在世界上存在的个人问题上却没有那么多的吸引力。
- en: Richards, even through a screen, is the sort of person who seems to genuinely
    embody what Carl Rogers called unconditional positive regard. And so all of this
    came fumbling out of me toward the end of our interview, which I’d tried to keep
    as empirically grounded as possible, but, I’ll be honest, had started to feel
    more like therapy. (My sense is that this may be a typical experience with Bill.)
    So I asked him about this challenge — of trying to understand my own experience
    through the scientific literature — and even as I did, I could feel it was the
    wrong direction, sensed what his answer might be. “You can’t have a happy marriage
    with your intellectual side,” he said.

  zh: 理查兹，即使通过屏幕，也似乎真正体现了卡尔·罗杰斯所称的无条件的积极关注。所以，在我们的采访快结束时，所有这些东西都笨拙地从我口中脱口而出，我试图让它尽可能地以经验为基础，但坦白说，它开始感觉更像是治疗。（我感觉这可能是与比尔一起的典型经历。）所以我问他这个挑战
    —— 试图通过科学文献来理解我自己的经历 —— 甚至在我这么做的时候，我能感觉到这是错误的方向，感觉到他的答案可能是什么。“你不能靠你的理性一面过上幸福的婚姻生活，”他说。
- en: “People are arriving at the psychedelic experience, or some form of visionary
    or mystical consciousness, from different places at different places in their
    lives,” Richards said. “Some are more ready to integrate insights than others.
    Some are more ready to allow experiences to occur than others.” (Point taken.)
    “We have to be very cautious writing about it and not oversimplify it.”

  zh: “人们以不同的方式在不同的生活阶段抵达致幻体验，或某种形式的幻觉或神秘意识，” 理查兹说。“有些人更愿意整合洞见，有些人更愿意让经历发生。”（有道理。）“我们在写作时必须非常谨慎，不能过于简化。”
- en: Though simplifying it is, in some sense, exactly what the measurement of the
    subjective psychedelic experience is doing — collapsing paradoxical and indescribable
    qualia into psychometrically validated scales which feed into some statistical
    model. The scales aren’t perfect. It seems quite clear that many of them remain
    strongly rooted in the perennialist tradition. Though that’s only a problem if
    you think perennial philosophy is wrong.

  zh: 虽然简化它在某种程度上确实是主观致幻体验的测量正在做的事情 —— 将矛盾和无法描述的品质折叠成心理测量学验证的量表，这些量表进入某种统计模型。这些量表并不完美。很显然，其中许多仍然根植于永恒主义传统。不过，只有当你认为永恒哲学是错误的时候，这才是一个问题。
- en: Still, my varied experience seems equally interpretable in terms of subjective
    experience and of physical effects. That seems to be where the science is at as
    well — at least for now. And as many researchers note, it’s likely that there’s
    no single mediating factor that can explain such complex phenomena that, at least
    in clinical settings, hold promise across so many indications. But what both the
    project to empirically study the subjective effects of psychedelics and the push
    to identify the neurological mechanisms behind their therapeutic potential don’t
    point to, what I take to be the most mysterious point of all, is that it’s not
    strictly necessary to understand why psychedelics work to know that they do. Call
    it neurological. Call it pharmacological. Call it mystical. Call it grace.

  zh: 尽管如此，我的各种经验似乎同样可以从主观经验和物理效应两方面解释。至少目前看来，科学的研究也似乎是在这个方向上。正如许多研究人员所指出的，很可能没有单一的中介因素可以解释在临床环境中有希望应用于如此多适应症的如此复杂的现象。但无论是实证研究致幻剂主观效应的项目，还是力求确定其治疗潜力背后的神经机制的推动，都没有指出我认为最神秘的一点，那就是了解为什么致幻剂起作用并不是严格必要的。把它称为神经学。把它称为药理学。把它称为神秘的。把它称为恩典。
