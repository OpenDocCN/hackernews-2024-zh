- en: 'Sometimes a seemingly silly question gets stuck in your craw and you can’t
    shake the feeling that something big lies behind it. We are constantly collecting
    these kinds of questions from our listeners, not to mention piling up a storehouse
    of our own “stupid” questions, as we lovingly call them. And a little while back,
    we noticed a little cluster of questions that seemed to have a shared edgy energy,
    and all led us to the same place: Our own bodies. So, today on Radiolab, we go
    down our throats and get under our skin, we take on evolution and anatomy and
    molecular cosmetics, to discover some very not-stupid answers to our seemingly
    stupid questions.'
