    Just about every Icelandic person has been on a hike, and they all seem to have
    a level of admiration and care for nature that's not as widespread elsewhere.

    be alright", and, while many languages have a similar expression, this one is
    really embedded in Icelandic culture.

- en: There was also the time when I was convinced to “walk up” (turns out it was
    actually climb up) one of the ice pinnacles atop of Snaefellsjökull. At the time
    I had no experience with crampons or an ice axe at all, yet the group of also
    amateurs from my ex-girlfriend's company were all pretty chill about the situation
    and pitched it as a seemingly easy thing.

- en: On the way up there, quite a few of the people got scared, and I for one nearly
    lost my oversized crampon, which came off my foot and caused me to slide down
    this steep ice slope that led straight into a crevasse at the bottom. I managed
    to stop myself with an ice axe self-arrest, saved by having used my free time
    in the past to watch alpinism videos with self-arrest tutorials.

    if the Icelanders themselves don't necessarily think about it much.

    a mix of belief that everything will be okay, but also determination and preparedness

    cabin in the South, and he told us about how despite him being okay and his house
    staying up, he lost all of his sheep due to the ash from the 2010 Eyjafjallajökull
    eruption.

    They operate well in the post-catastrophe chaos, bringing both a necessary optimism

- en: The Fagradalsfjall eruption in 2021, which happened while I was still living
    there, marked the end of around 800 years of no volcanic activity in the Reykjanes
    peninsula, an area of significant economic importance that's also dangerously
    close to where the vast majority of Icelanders live - the Reykjavík capital region.

    a well-trained Search & Rescue team, and a conscious population means Iceland
    feels ready to deal with this, and that everything will be okay.

    ahead of this 2023 eruption, an event somewhat analogous to the heroic effort
    of the Heimaey evacuation in 1973, where an entire island was evacuated in just
    a few hours after the alarm sounded for a surprise eruption. Plus they also managed
    to save the harbor, by pumping seawater and spraying it into the lava to redirect
    it.
