    Google, Bing, and X (Twitter).

    laundering trust in their systems, while simultaneously deflecting blame onto
    advertisers when these mechanisms are exploited for fraudulent purposes.

- en: URL spoofing is the act of presenting an internet address that appears to lead
    to one destination but actually leads to another, unexpected, location. URL spoofing
    is commonly referred to as “vanity URLs” by the adtech industry when provided
    as a first-class feature on adtech platforms.

    objectives. It is a staple practice in spam emails and scam websites, where links
    may appear legitimate but lead to harmful content.

    ‘abusing’ their unverified vanity URL systems. These companies should not be able
    to get away with creating systems that enable link fraud and then pretend to tie
    their hands behind their back when asked to combat the issue. They have created
    systems for trust-laundered URL spoofing, and then disclaimed ethical or legal
    responsibility for the fundamental technical failures of these systems.

- en: It is not possible to automatically prevent link fraud in systems that allow
    for unverified URL spoofing to occur. If adtech providers do not perform domain
    ownership verification on vanity URLs, advertisers are technically free to commit
    fraud as they please.

    Interestingly, some of the FBI’s advice for checking ad authenticity is inadequate
    in practice. The FBI suggests “Before clicking on an advertisement, check the
    URL to make sure the site is authentic. A malicious domain name may be similar
    to the intended URL but with typos or a misplaced letter.” — this is useless advice
    in the face of unverified vanity URLs. Instead of asking private citizens to block
    an entire ‘legal’ industry, the FBI should be investigating adtech platforms for
    systemically enabling link fraud.
