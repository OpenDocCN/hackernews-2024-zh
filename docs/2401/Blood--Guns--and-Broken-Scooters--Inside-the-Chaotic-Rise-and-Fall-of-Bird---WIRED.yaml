- en: In a minivan with the rear seats ripped out, John is chasing one of his 250
    electric scooters down a California highway. He finds it 10 miles away, hiding
    in a bush—a run-and-dump tactic that he says thieves use to test whether anyone
    will come after them before they take a scooter home. John, not his real name,
    always gives chase, because his livelihood depends on it. “If I come in too soft,
    then they say, ‘Oh, this guy, he's a pussy. I could kick his ass.’ So I have to
    be a little aggressive,” says John, who is well past the age where it’s safe to
    fist-fight. He spends the next hour hunting down other scooters from his fleet
    that have been knocked over or need recharging.

- en: John is a contractor for scooter rental company Bird Global and looks after
    all the scooters in a particular area in return for a cut of rental fees paid
    by riders. Fleet managers, as they are called, are technically their own bosses,
    but John spends his days at the beck and call of the company’s app. Bird requires
    him to maintain several productivity scores that, to John, feel nonnegotiable.
    Each scooter lit up in red in the fleet manager app knocks his score down. That
    warning can signal that a scooter has been stolen, fallen over due to sloppy parking
    or vandalism, or simply sat idle for too long—situations largely outside of John’s
    control.

- en: For Bird to offer convenient rides at the tap of an app, John and other fleet
    managers must handle the grinding logistics of scattering scooters around cites.
    It takes street smarts, plenty of guts, hours of driving, and sometimes strongly
    implied threats of violence. If more than 10 percent of his fleet turns red, John
    can get chewed out by a Bird manager, and he has been told he could lose some
    scooters for breach of contract.

- en: Bird became the largest micromobility company in North America this fall after
    [purchasing competitor Spin](https://ir.bird.co/news-events/press-releases/detail/111/bird-acquires-spin-now-north-americas-largest).
    It was once valued at more than $2 billion and seemed to epitomize a shiny future
    of clean urban transport. But ridership slumped during the pandemic—and so did
    Bird’s shares after its 2021 stock market debut. In late 2022, after a series
    of business setbacks, the company warned investors that it could go bankrupt.
    It was booted from the New York Stock Exchange in September of this year for failing
    to consistently maintain a market cap of $15 million. As the company scrambled
    to survive, it has squeezed its fleet managers harder. On December 20, their situation
    became more uncertain when Bird announced it was filing for bankruptcy.

    More than a dozen current or former fleet managers in the US, who like John asked
    for anonymity, fearing retaliation from Bird, described their unstable and sometimes
    punishing relationships with the company. They made personal and monetary sacrifices
    for Bird while, as contractors, having little power over their working conditions.
    And as Bird’s business struggled, fleet managers were presented with updated contracts
    that John and others say have cut their income by about half.

  zh: 那一刻之前的几年对许多 Bird 车队经理来说都很艰难。美国有十多位现任或前任车队经理，像约翰一样请求匿名，担心受到 Bird 的报复，描述了他们与公司的不稳定而有时惩罚性的关系。他们为
    Bird 作出了个人和经济上的牺牲，但作为承包商，对工作条件几乎没有什么权力。随着 Bird 的业务陷入困境，车队经理们被提供了更新的合同，约翰和其他人称，这些合同削减了他们约一半的收入。
- en: The situation for some fleet managers has become desperate. One in the Pacific
    Northwest said he had only slept eight hours on a recent weekend and that he and
    his two employees have all been in separate car accidents on the job. Three other
    fleet managers say they have sometimes carried guns when on the street with Bird
    scooters, because brandishing a weapon can feel useful when facing off scooter
    thieves or vandals. Several former West Coast fleet managers carried Tasers while
    on the job.

    Bird 滑板车一起时会带枪，因为当面对滑板车盗贼或破坏者时，挥舞武器会感觉有用。几位前西海岸车队经理在工作中带着防身电击器。
- en: WIRED sent a list of questions to Bird based on interviews with fleet managers,
    but company spokesperson Adam Davis declined to address most of them. He said
    that Bird was ending the fleet manager program in some cities—apparently cutting
    the contractors loose and replacing them with staff or new contractors who handle
    more scooters and are paid less. In a statement sent to WIRED before the bankruptcy
    announcement, Michael Washinushi, Bird’s interim CEO, said the company got new
    management and ownership this year that was trying to “reset” how the company
    does business. “Through the course of the year, management has improved operations
    while being laser focused on providing a safe and enjoyable experience for our
    riders and an improved relationship with our partners, including our fleet managers,”
    Washinushi said.

  zh: WIRED 根据对车队经理的采访发送了一份问题清单给 Bird，但公司发言人亚当·戴维斯拒绝回答大部分问题。他表示，Bird 正在一些城市结束车队经理计划——显然是放弃这些承包商，用员工或新的承包商取代他们，这些人处理更多的滑板车并得到更少的报酬。在破产宣布之前，Bird
    的临时 CEO 迈克尔·华盛谢在给 WIRED 发送的一份声明中表示，该公司今年已有新的管理和所有权，试图“重置”公司的业务模式。“在这一年的过程中，管理层改善了运营，同时专注于为我们的骑手提供安全愉快的体验，与我们的合作伙伴建立了更好的关系，包括我们的车队经理，”华盛谢说。

    in Santa Monica, California. Nine months later it had raised more than $300 million

    20 亿美元。随着[城市居民尝试电动出行的乐趣和新奇感](https://www.wired.com/story/2018-year-of-the-scooter-what-happens-2019/)，投资者开始接受滑板车可以取代汽车颠覆城市交通的想法。
- en: Part of Bird’s model was to outsource the challenging logistics of leaving scooters
    propped up in public places for anyone to rent, steal, or abuse. In the company’s
    early days, it invited people to become freelance “chargers” who got paid for
    finding and recharging scooters low on battery, and it used freelance mechanics
    for repairs, paying out on a per-scooter basis. The company started [hiring salaried

    Bird [fired 406 office-based workers](https://dot.la/bird-layoffs-meeting-story-2645612465.html)
    over a two-minute Zoom call. Company filings later showed that rides dropped by
    more than 50 percent in 2020\. It was around this time, during the spring and
    summer of 2020, when people who had been freelancing as chargers say they started
    getting surprise messages from Bird. They were pitched an exciting new opportunity
    that involved getting their own fleet of scooters and a cut of the money from

    年的乘车量下降了 50% 以上。大约在这个时候，即 2020 年春季和夏季，曾经作为充电员自由职业的人们开始收到 Bird 的意外消息。他们被推销一项令人兴奋的新机会，这项机会涉及到拥有自己的滑板车车队，并且可以从每次乘车的收入中获得一部分。
- en: The new fleet manager gig combined the duties of charging, repairing, and storing
    scooters—just about every aspect of the scooter operation other than the app that
    people tapped to find a ride. Some of the job’s responsibilities could be tragic—several
    fleet managers recall picking up scooters from accident scenes. Participants had
    to start their own companies to get scooters from Bird, agreeing to make “equipment
    payments” that were taken out of their ride payouts each week until the scooters
    were paid off. After that, a fleet manager would be entitled to 81 percent of
    the net revenue from each ride, though contracts show the title of the scooter
    would always remain with Bird.

  zh: 新的车队经理兼职包括了对滑板车的充电、维修和存储工作——几乎是滑板车运营的所有方面，除了供人们找到乘车的应用程序。这份工作的一些责任可能会很悲惨——一些车队经理回忆起从事故现场收集滑板车的情景。参与者必须自己创办公司才能从
    Bird 获取滑板车，并同意每周从他们的乘车收入中扣除"设备付款"，直到滑板车还清为止。之后，车队经理将有权获得每次乘车的净收入的 81%，尽管合同显示滑板车的所有权始终属于
    Bird。

    Fleet managers who joined the program when it launched by April 2020 describe
    it as almost addictive. "So much money, that it was actually pretty stupid,” says
    a former fleet manager in San Diego, who quickly built a thriving business. He
    recalls seeing gross sales in the high six figures for his fleet’s first year,
    and earning close to $100,000 out of that in profits, after Bird’s fees and his
    own expenses such as van purchases and warehouse rentals. “It was a lot of low-income
    people that the program was employing when a lot of these other businesses didn't
    even look at us,” says another former fleet manager in San Diego.

    2020 年 4 月推出时描述它几乎令人上瘾。一位曾在圣迭戈担任车队经理的前任表示：“这么多钱，实际上相当愚蠢，”他很快就建立了一个蓬勃发展的业务。他回忆起他的车队第一年的总销售额高达六位数，净利润接近
    $100,000，扣除 Bird 的费用以及他自己的开支，如货车购买和仓库租金。“在许多其他企业甚至不看我们的时候，这个项目雇佣了很多低收入人群，”另一位前圣迭戈车队经理表示。
