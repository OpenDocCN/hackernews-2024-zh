- en: In a minivan with the rear seats ripped out, John is chasing one of his 250
    electric scooters down a California highway. He finds it 10 miles away, hiding
    in a bush—a run-and-dump tactic that he says thieves use to test whether anyone
    will come after them before they take a scooter home. John, not his real name,
    always gives chase, because his livelihood depends on it. “If I come in too soft,
    then they say, ‘Oh, this guy, he's a pussy. I could kick his ass.’ So I have to
    be a little aggressive,” says John, who is well past the age where it’s safe to
    fist-fight. He spends the next hour hunting down other scooters from his fleet
    that have been knocked over or need recharging.

- en: John is a contractor for scooter rental company Bird Global and looks after
    all the scooters in a particular area in return for a cut of rental fees paid
    by riders. Fleet managers, as they are called, are technically their own bosses,
    but John spends his days at the beck and call of the company’s app. Bird requires
    him to maintain several productivity scores that, to John, feel nonnegotiable.
    Each scooter lit up in red in the fleet manager app knocks his score down. That
    warning can signal that a scooter has been stolen, fallen over due to sloppy parking
    or vandalism, or simply sat idle for too long—situations largely outside of John’s
    control.

- en: For Bird to offer convenient rides at the tap of an app, John and other fleet
    managers must handle the grinding logistics of scattering scooters around cites.
    It takes street smarts, plenty of guts, hours of driving, and sometimes strongly
    implied threats of violence. If more than 10 percent of his fleet turns red, John
    can get chewed out by a Bird manager, and he has been told he could lose some
    scooters for breach of contract.

- en: Bird became the largest micromobility company in North America this fall after
    [purchasing competitor Spin](https://ir.bird.co/news-events/press-releases/detail/111/bird-acquires-spin-now-north-americas-largest).
    It was once valued at more than $2 billion and seemed to epitomize a shiny future
    of clean urban transport. But ridership slumped during the pandemic—and so did
    Bird’s shares after its 2021 stock market debut. In late 2022, after a series
    of business setbacks, the company warned investors that it could go bankrupt.
    It was booted from the New York Stock Exchange in September of this year for failing
    to consistently maintain a market cap of $15 million. As the company scrambled
    to survive, it has squeezed its fleet managers harder. On December 20, their situation
    became more uncertain when Bird announced it was filing for bankruptcy.

- en: The years leading up to that moment have been tough for many Bird fleet managers.
    More than a dozen current or former fleet managers in the US, who like John asked
    for anonymity, fearing retaliation from Bird, described their unstable and sometimes
    punishing relationships with the company. They made personal and monetary sacrifices
    for Bird while, as contractors, having little power over their working conditions.
    And as Bird’s business struggled, fleet managers were presented with updated contracts
    that John and others say have cut their income by about half.

    Northwest said he had only slept eight hours on a recent weekend and that he and
    his two employees have all been in separate car accidents on the job. Three other
    fleet managers say they have sometimes carried guns when on the street with Bird
    scooters, because brandishing a weapon can feel useful when facing off scooter
    thieves or vandals. Several former West Coast fleet managers carried Tasers while
    on the job.

- en: WIRED sent a list of questions to Bird based on interviews with fleet managers,
    but company spokesperson Adam Davis declined to address most of them. He said
    that Bird was ending the fleet manager program in some cities—apparently cutting
    the contractors loose and replacing them with staff or new contractors who handle
    more scooters and are paid less. In a statement sent to WIRED before the bankruptcy
    announcement, Michael Washinushi, Bird’s interim CEO, said the company got new
    management and ownership this year that was trying to “reset” how the company
    does business. “Through the course of the year, management has improved operations
    while being laser focused on providing a safe and enjoyable experience for our
    riders and an improved relationship with our partners, including our fleet managers,”
    Washinushi said.

    in Santa Monica, California. Nine months later it had raised more than $300 million
    in funding at a valuation of about $2 billion. As [city dwellers flirted with
    the fun and novelty](https://www.wired.com/story/2018-year-of-the-scooter-what-happens-2019/)

    propped up in public places for anyone to rent, steal, or abuse. In the company’s
    early days, it invited people to become freelance “chargers” who got paid for
    finding and recharging scooters low on battery, and it used freelance mechanics
    for repairs, paying out on a per-scooter basis. The company started [hiring salaried
    mechanics](https://www.wired.com/story/spin-scooter-share-gig-economy-employees)

    Bird [fired 406 office-based workers](https://dot.la/bird-layoffs-meeting-story-2645612465.html)
    over a two-minute Zoom call. Company filings later showed that rides dropped by
    more than 50 percent in 2020\. It was around this time, during the spring and
    summer of 2020, when people who had been freelancing as chargers say they started
    getting surprise messages from Bird. They were pitched an exciting new opportunity
    that involved getting their own fleet of scooters and a cut of the money from
    every ride taken.

- en: The new fleet manager gig combined the duties of charging, repairing, and storing
    scooters—just about every aspect of the scooter operation other than the app that
    people tapped to find a ride. Some of the job’s responsibilities could be tragic—several
    fleet managers recall picking up scooters from accident scenes. Participants had
    to start their own companies to get scooters from Bird, agreeing to make “equipment
    payments” that were taken out of their ride payouts each week until the scooters
    were paid off. After that, a fleet manager would be entitled to 81 percent of
    the net revenue from each ride, though contracts show the title of the scooter
    would always remain with Bird.

    Fleet managers who joined the program when it launched by April 2020 describe
    it as almost addictive. "So much money, that it was actually pretty stupid,” says
    a former fleet manager in San Diego, who quickly built a thriving business. He
    recalls seeing gross sales in the high six figures for his fleet’s first year,
    and earning close to $100,000 out of that in profits, after Bird’s fees and his
    own expenses such as van purchases and warehouse rentals. “It was a lot of low-income
    people that the program was employing when a lot of these other businesses didn't
    even look at us,” says another former fleet manager in San Diego.
