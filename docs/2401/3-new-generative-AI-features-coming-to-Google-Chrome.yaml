- en: Over the last few years, we’ve brought the latest machine learning and AI technologies
    into Chrome to make searching the web easier, safer and more accessible. We started
    with improving practical, everyday tasks, like helping you add [real-time captions](https://blog.google/products/chrome/live-caption-chrome/)
    to videos, better [detect malicious sites](https://security.googleblog.com/2023/05/io-2023-android-security-and-privacy.html.html),
    manage [permission prompts](https://blog.google/products/chrome/building-a-more-helpful-browser-with-machine-learning/)
    and generate the [key points of a webpage](https://blog.google/products/search/google-search-generative-ai-learning-features/).

    generative AI features to make it even easier and more efficient to browse — all

- en: You’ll be able to try out these new features in Chrome on Macs and Windows PCs
    over the next few days, starting in the U.S. Just sign into Chrome, select “Settings”
    from the three-dot menu and navigate to the “[Experimental AI](https://support.google.com/chrome?p=experimental_ai_setting)”
    page. Because these features are early public experiments, they’ll be disabled
    for enterprise and educational accounts for now.
