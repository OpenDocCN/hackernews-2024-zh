> 来源：[https://pola.rs/](https://pola.rs/)

01

#### Easy
to use

Write your queries the way they were intended. Polars will determine the most efficient way to execute them using its query optimizer.

02

#### Embarrassingly
parallel

Complete your queries faster! Polars fully utilizes the power of your machine by dividing the workload among the available CPU cores without any additional configuration or serialization overhead.

03

#### Apache
Arrow

Polars utilizes the Apache Arrow memory model allowing you to easily integrate with existing tools in the data landscape. It supports zero-copy data sharing for efficient collaboration.

04

#### Close to
the metal

Polars is written from the ground up, designed close to the machine and without external dependencies. This allows for full control of the ecosystem (API, memory & execution).

05

#### Written
in Rust

The core of Polars is written in Rust, one of the fastest growing programming languages in the world. Rust allows for high performance with fine-grained control over memory.

06

#### Out
of core

Want to process large data sets that are bigger than your memory? Our streaming API allows you to process your results efficiently, eliminating the need to keep all data in memory.
