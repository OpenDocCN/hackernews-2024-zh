    of Paris on New Year’s Eve, where everyone is so busy filming the countdown and
    fireworks on their phones that they forget to experience them. It’s surreal.

    documenting events instead of being in the moment. But it’s not just events anymore.
    People document *everything* now. Every mundane moment of their lives. What they
    wear. What they eat. What they buy. And as well as ordinary things people now
    feel the need to document profoundly personal moments, from [health scares](https://www.tiktok.com/@lianajadee/video/7231235678976183578)
    to [mental breakdowns](https://www.tiktok.com/@itsnotalexam/video/7225093238460386586)

    to me are the couples who document their entire relationships online. I will never
    understand the amount of comments saying *couple goals* and *how do I find this!*
    to the most staged, rehearsed, insincere moments I’ve ever seen. I can’t get my
    head around applauding people who set up a camera in the corner to record themselves
    being romantic. Like everyone [praising this husband](https://www.tiktok.com/@matt_and_abby/video/7232048159575248170)

    document their kids’ entire childhoods online. Parents who share and monetise
    every milestone, every emotion, every phase, every tantrum, sometimes every *day*

    Who shove a vlogging camera in their baby’s face from the moment they are born

    in everyone now. This pressure to post everything. And I think it’s a massive
    cause of anxiety for Gen Z. There’s a sense now that something [didn’t happen
    if you don’t share it](https://www.theguardian.com/news/2015/feb/26/pics-or-it-didnt-happen-mantra-instagram-era-facebook-twitter#:~:text=Removing%20the%20mediating%20elements%20of,may%20believe%20and%20validate%20i).
    There are young people who wouldn’t understand going to an event, travelling somewhere,
    being in a relationship, if they couldn’t post about it. *They would not see the
    point.* They simply cannot conceive of a life that exists without an audience
    consuming it. Like, for example, the popular belief now that if your boyfriend
    doesn’t post photos of you [he’s cheating](https://www.tiktok.com/@emilyhamocon/video/7254734866011458859)
    or doesn’t really love you. Or it’s a [red flag](https://www.reddit.com/r/Tinder/comments/14k471h/red_flag/)
    if you meet someone and they aren’t on social media (just me who thinks this is
    a major green flag?)

    up excusing the weirdest behaviour. *[They just want to remember the fireworks!](https://twitter.com/tiya_tequila/status/1742599912917766560)*
    Really? There’s crowds of people all capturing the same thing; they will likely
    never watch that video back, and if they’re posting it online that’s not for memories;
    it’s for attention. [](https://twitter.com/Texastargirl/status/1735213227288432945https://twitter.com/Texastargirl/status/1735213227288432945)

    In what world! Camcorders didn’t come with this *urge*, with this compulsion to
    constantly update people, with tying your self-worth to likes and followers. *You’ll
    regret it if you don’t record it!* Sure, capture occasional moments; keep them
    for you. But I think if this generation is on track to regret anything it will
    be the time we wasted documenting and editing and filtering and marketing ourselves
    for social media. Time we will never get back. My bet is we won’t look back at
    our hundreds of thousands of Instagram Stories and Snapchats and Boomerangs with
    fondness that we filmed these moments, but with aching regret that we didn’t fully
    feel them.

    much on social media are insecure or unhappy or hiding something. Often it’s the
    opposite. I’m pretty sure those with the best relationships post about them the
    least. That those with real confidence and self-love don’t need to post thousands
    of selfies to prove it. And that truly empowered people don’t depend on external
    validation for every feeling or opinion or decision they make. Isn’t that just
    a basic rule in life? That those who are the loudest about their achievements
    and relationships and morality often have the most doubts about them? And if I
    know one thing it’s that if you’re experiencing a genuinely moving moment, if
    you’re really *in it,* the absolute last thing you want or think about doing is
    taking out your phone, cutting through it and cheapening it. The best love is
    quiet. The best confidence is quiet. And so are the lives with the most meaning.

    I’m sorry but they watch your fireworks story for half a second. They hover over
    your selfie and then swipe to someone else’s. They skip through the concert you
    posted. They look at your life and immediately think about theirs. The people
    who actually care are the ones you don’t need to perform or prove anything to.
    Strangers don’t care about you, and that’s a fundamental truth social media platforms
    depend on us forgetting.'

    it a relief. You don’t need to document everything! Nobody cares anyway! And I
    think young girls need a reminder that this pressure to constantly post and update
    is very new; this pressure to live your life and also perform and market it to
    everyone at the same time; you are the first generation to feel it this intensely,
    and, also, you can free yourself from it. It’s unnecessary. And these influencers
    who do post everything are *not people to aspire to*. If they influence you of
    anything it should be to not copy their deranged behaviour and document your entire
    life online. You don’t want to be anything like people who [bring ring lights](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/the-crowning-glory-for-tiktoks-new-mums-birthingmakeup-hmrfq6mjw)

    (#ptsd!). Who hold their newborn baby with one hand and scroll through their Instagram
    likes with the other. Don’t start heading in that direction, because there’s no
    life there. These people have traded privacy and sometimes their own human decency
    for an existence designed entirely for strangers. Their lives are often superficial
    and empty in exchange.

    they forget to share it; who protects their personal life while everyone else
    hands theirs over so freely; who can see the value in a moment without needing
    strangers to validate it for them. Be someone rare. It’s a cruel trick of modern
    life to convince us that everyone cares what we’re doing, all the time; that everyone
    is deeply invested in how we live and how we identify and how we feel. Seriously
    believing that is enough to make anyone mentally ill. And looking at famous influencers
    with fans who *are* that invested, I wouldn’t wish it on anyone.

    so cheaply to strangers. Keep some things sacred. Let some memories fade and look
    back at them through fuzzy nostalgia instead of the cheap glare of an iPhone camera
    roll. Enjoy the fireworks.
