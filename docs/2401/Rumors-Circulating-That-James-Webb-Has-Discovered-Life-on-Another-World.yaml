    persistent rumor that the James Webb Space Telescope has found a planet with strong
    signs of life has recently hit a new high among the scientific community. A lot
    of the hype may be overblown, but at the very least the speculation reflects the
    space telescope''s extraordinary promise in the field of exobiology.'

    so far, they acknowledged the possibility of a huge discovery on the horizon that
    — sorry, folks — would take years worth of followup research to confirm.

    of potential biosignatures that could make habitability more or less likely for
    a given exoplanet," Knicole Colón, the James Webb''s deputy project scientist
    for exoplanet science, told *Ars*. "Future missions will be needed to conclusively
    establish the habitability of an exoplanet."'

    leaves the door open to some exciting possibilities — a no, but "*not* a hard
    no," in *Ars*' analysis.

    stems from the telescope's [detection of a potential biosignature](https://futurism.com/the-byte/james-webb-possible-signs-life-distant-planet)
    on the exoplanet K2-18 b last year, a suspected ocean world around 8.6 times more
    massive than Earth and approximately 120 light years away.

    — by a [recent article from *The Spectator*](https://www.spectator.co.uk/article/have-we-just-discovered-aliens/)
    titled "Have we just discovered aliens?" which features opinions from respected
    figures in the astronomy community, including a tantalizing quote from [*CNBC*'s
    interview](https://www.cnbc.com/video/2024/01/04/tim-peake-discusses-what-the-future-holds-for-space-exploration.html)

    b is a molecule called dimethyl sulfide, a smelly substance that on Earth is produced
    only by living organisms.

- en: That's a huge clue that this "Hyacean" world — one with oceans and a hydrogen-rich
    atmosphere — is potentially home to life. Even better, the exoplanet lies in its
    star's habitable or "Goldilocks" zone, meaning the surface is neither too hot
    nor too cold for life as we know it.

- en: But the evidence, as Colón said, isn't definitive. More observations, perhaps
    with entirely new instruments, will be needed to confirm the detection. Moreover,
    it's possible that dimethyl sulfide can be produced without life. Understandably,
    scientists don't want to jump the gun, as a long history of [extraterrestrial
    hoaxes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Moon_Hoax) and spoofs have haunted
    the field.
