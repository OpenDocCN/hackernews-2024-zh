    – somewhat quirky – online tournaments. It’s often hard to search for these because
    you don’t know exactly what you are looking for. It’s more like these videos end
    up finding you.

    in YouTube's endless well. Eventually, I stumbled upon a video titled “

    immediately caught my attention. One of the finalists, Sidnev, had the controller
    positioned between their left foot and hand, while rhythmically tapping the controller's
    back with their right hand. They were also wearing what looked like a wool glove.

    something intriguing taking place, something new to learn. After a brief Google
    search, I found out that the tapping technique is known as

    a friction reducer between the hand and controller, further accelerating keystrokes
    and therefore enabling to move the pieces in Tetris at a faster pace.'

    sports isn’t universally recognized or standardized. Breakthroughs and new techniques
    might develop quickly to constantly push the boundaries of what is possible. Such
    as the technique of rolling in Classic Tetris, which was only uncovered in 2020\.

    of a random place they land at. I wouldn’t be surprised if some of these players
    have been contacted by some national intelligence service in the past to identify
    the locations of photos.

    was commentating on the matches. He helped to make the game big and since then
    many more – often younger players – have advanced so far to quickly surpass him.
    That’s how fast this competitive scene is evolving.

    incredible skill and commitment these players display. Even though some of these
    games may seem unusual or quirky, if the players find joy in playing them, that''s
    all that matters. They found something that they are passionate about, which is
    something other people struggle with these days. Personally, I find great joy
    in watching these competitions, even just as a spectator. So, dear YouTube algorithm:
    kindly give me more of these!'
