    60 days to resolve it informally. If you and Microsoft can’t, you and Microsoft
    agree to binding individual arbitration before the American Arbitration Association
    under the Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”), and not to sue in court in front of
    a judge or jury. Instead, a neutral arbitrator will decide. Class action lawsuits,
    class-wide arbitrations, private attorney-general actions, and any other proceeding
    where someone acts in a representative capacity are not allowed; nor is combining
    individual proceedings without the consent of all parties. The complete Arbitration
    Agreement contains more terms and is at aka.ms/arb-agreement-1\. You and Microsoft

    the interpretation of this agreement, claims for its breach, and all other claims

    in the federal court in King County, Washington for all disputes heard in court
    (excluding arbitration). If not, you and Microsoft consent to exclusive jurisdiction
    and venue in the Superior Court of King County, Washington for all disputes heard
