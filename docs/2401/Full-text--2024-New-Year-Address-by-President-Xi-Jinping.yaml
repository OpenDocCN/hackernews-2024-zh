    with a great civilization. Across this vast expanse of land, wisps of smoke in
    deserts of the north and drizzles in the south invoke our fond memory of many
    millennium-old stories. The mighty Yellow River and Yangtze River never fail to
    inspire us. Discoveries at the archeological sites of Liangzhu and Erlitou tell
    us much about the dawn of Chinese civilization. The ancient Chinese characters
    inscribed on oracle bones of the Yin Ruins, the cultural treasures of the Sanxingdui
    Site, and the collections of the National Archives of Publications and Culture
    bear witness to the evolution of Chinese culture. All this stands as testament
    to the time-honored history of China and its splendid civilization. And all this
