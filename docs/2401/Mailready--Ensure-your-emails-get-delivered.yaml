    are taking additional steps to improve deliverability and block unwanted messages
    from user's inboxes. (We expect more providers to follow). There are new requirements
    if you want to get your emails delivered.

    senders are required to comply with others like authentication and spam. It is
    also in your best interest to comply for improved deliverability.

- en: You are a bulk sender if you send more than 5,000 emails in a day. Hold on...even
    if you don't do that daily volume yet, remember you are planning to get there.
    Plus there will be special days when you will have to engage more audience than
    usual.
