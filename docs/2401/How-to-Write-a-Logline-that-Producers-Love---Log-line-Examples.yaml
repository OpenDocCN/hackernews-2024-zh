  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    tv show, etc. that hooks the reader in and describes the central conflict of the
    story.

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Character studies are fun, but characters are only defined by the actions they
    take. A great logline sets up what the character wants--we’ll have to see if he
    or she achieves it. The best logline examples pose questions that we'll have to
    watch play out.

    it may be a goal, but it is a bit too bland, and possibly too broad.
  prefs: []

    man sets out to build a robot to win a competition." Immediately, we can visualize
