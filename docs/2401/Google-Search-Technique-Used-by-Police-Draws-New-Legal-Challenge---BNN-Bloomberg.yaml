- en: (Bloomberg) -- Civil liberties advocates are mounting a new challenge to the
    use by police of Google search data for help solving criminal cases, as the practice
    draws greater scrutiny nationwide.

- en: After a Pennsylvania woman was raped in 2016, police submitted a search warrant
    to Alphabet’s Google for information about users who had typed the victim’s name
    or address into the search engine in the week leading up to the attack, according
    to court papers. Google responded with the IP address of a user who had searched
    for the victim’s address twice shortly before the incident, court papers show.
    That breakthrough prompted police to begin monitoring a corrections officer, who
    was ultimately arrested and convicted.

- en: On Friday, the Electronic Frontier Foundation, the National Association of Criminal
    Defense Lawyers and its Pennsylvania chapter argued in a court filing that the
    investigative technique used in the case, known as a keyword search warrant, is
    dangerously broad and threatens to infringe on the privacy rights of innocent
    people.

    to rummage through our most private information, and the Pennsylvania Supreme
    Court should find them unconstitutional,” NACDL Fourth Amendment Center Litigation
    Director Michael Price said in a statement.

    come under scrutiny in the wake of the US Supreme Court’s decision to overturn
    the right to abortion. Privacy advocates have warned that keyword search warrants
    and geofence warrants, in which police ask Google to produce data about users
    whose devices were present near the scene of a crime, could be used to prosecute
    women who obtain abortions in states where it’s illegal.

    search warrant could be used in a murder case, sparking concerns the decision
    may encourage more police to embrace the controversial technique.

    and it refrained from weighing in about the use of Google’s search data more broadly.
    That leaves advocates hopeful for a different outcome in Pennsylvania, said EFF
    Surveillance Litigation Director Andrew Crocker.

- en: In December, Google ended its practice of responding to geofence warrants. The
    move came three months after a Bloomberg Businessweek investigation that found
    police across the US were increasingly using warrants to obtain location and search
    data from Google, even for nonviolent cases, and even for people who had nothing
    to do with the crime.

    consider the constitutionality of keyword search warrants, which may grow more
    popular as police search for new investigative tools, Crocker said.
