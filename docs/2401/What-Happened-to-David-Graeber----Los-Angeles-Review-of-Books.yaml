    origin, indeed that “equality” and “the state” are not sensible or singular concepts

    of the state and of economic inequality arose in the Enlightenment of the 18th
    century, historians say, primarily because of the challenges presented by greater
    contact with diverse cultures in the era of colonialism. But these questions rested,
    Graeber and Wengrow argue, on a set of historically contingent, tendentious, and
    simplistic readings of human history by figures such as Rousseau and Turgot. Both
    “inequality” and “the state,” on Graeber’s late view (or on'

    anarchist position, or else leaves you trying to define it in other terms, terms
    more adequate to the subtlety and complexity of power as it actually appears in

    degree of differential access to resources, has become “technocratic tinkering,”

    or ill-framed does not indicate that inequality of wealth is not a fundamental
    social problem. To make sure you don’t miss the centrality of this stunning turnabout,
    Graeber and Wengrow return to their critique of egalitarianism in their conclusion,

    be defensible, require a moral justification; social contract theory and all other
    attempts in this regard are pathetically inadequate. Therefore, there should be
    no political state. In late Graeber, this looks simplistic and nonempirical. “The

    I am in the latter camp, but I want to acknowledge that liberal political philosophy
    might find an interesting new set of justifications and also interesting new versions
    and formulations in late Graeber. In any case, Graeber and Wengrow centrally argue
    that concepts such as individual rights and democratic decision-making procedures,
    so central to Enlightenment political thought, in fact originated in an “indigenous
    critique” by colonized peoples of the political arrangements of European powers.
    They make this vivid with the figure of Kandiaronk (died 1701), a Wendat orator,
    probably from what is now Michigan, whose challenges to Western political systems
    may well have been (“may well have been” and “almost certainly” appear frequently
    in this book) influential on Diderot and Voltaire.

    rights and freedoms from the familiar claim that it is a Eurocentric artifact

    I wouldn’t have thought that I’d hear the claim from Graeber, especially as there

    supports it thinly at best and is widely and wildly in tension with it at worst.
    Graeber was never a relativist, exactly, but casually applying the same three
    concepts to every culture that has ever existed seems incompatible with his previous
    vast respect for human differences, not to mention many of his own earlier political
    positions. The persistent “threeness” of the distinctions hints at a line of a
