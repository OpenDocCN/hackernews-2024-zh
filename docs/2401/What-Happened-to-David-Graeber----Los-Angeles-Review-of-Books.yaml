    I am in the latter camp, but I want to acknowledge that liberal political philosophy
    might find an interesting new set of justifications and also interesting new versions
    and formulations in late Graeber. In any case, Graeber and Wengrow centrally argue
    that concepts such as individual rights and democratic decision-making procedures,
    so central to Enlightenment political thought, in fact originated in an “indigenous
    critique” by colonized peoples of the political arrangements of European powers.
    They make this vivid with the figure of Kandiaronk (died 1701), a Wendat orator,
    probably from what is now Michigan, whose challenges to Western political systems
    may well have been (“may well have been” and “almost certainly” appear frequently
    in this book) influential on Diderot and Voltaire.

    Graeber was never a relativist, exactly, but casually applying the same three

    vast respect for human differences, not to mention many of his own earlier political
