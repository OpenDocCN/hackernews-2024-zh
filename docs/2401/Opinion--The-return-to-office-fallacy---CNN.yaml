    and the others live in places like Chicago, Mexico City and San Francisco. We
    have met in person only twice in the year that the production has been up and
    running, and we have put out dozens of highly produced episodes, often featuring
    multiple guests, which go through many rounds of edits.

    to their offices. Banks like [Goldman Sachs](https://www.businessinsider.com/return-to-office-rto-banks-hedge-funds-private-equity-2023-9) and [JPMorgan
    Chase](https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/12/business/jpmorgan-return-to-office-five-days/index.html) and
    tech giants like [Meta](https://www.cnn.com/2023/06/01/business/meta-return-to-office/index.html) are
    demanding that their staff be back at the office several days a week.

    the necessity of having chance encounters at the office where folks bounce creative,
    productive ideas off of each other.

    who claimed in 2021 that working from home “doesn’t work for spontaneous idea
    generation.” There is no empirical [evidence](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/23/upshot/remote-work-innovation-office.html) for
    this claim, and the desire for employers to see their employees working in their
    offices seems to be more about the need for control and an attachment to the old
    ways of doing things.

    perspective at a time when a third of Americans who can do their job [remotely](https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2023/03/30/about-a-third-of-us-workers-who-can-work-from-home-do-so-all-the-time/) now
    only work from home, up from only 7% before Covid, according to the Pew Research
    Center, yet the economy is very strong in terms of low [unemployment](https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/05/economy/jobs-report-december-final/index.html) and [GDP
    growth](https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/07/economy/us-economy-china-europe/index.html).

    expect quite different economic results.

    arrangement gives me a lot more time to spend with my kids, and if there is any
    kind of unforeseen emergency, I can be there for them in a way that, during the
    era of the office, I couldn’t be.

    which is, after all, largely an artifact of the 20th century thanks to the rise
    of mass transportation, the ability to build tall office buildings and the previous
    immovability of the “work” telephone, which was stuck to a desk. All this, thankfully,
    is going the way of the dodo.

    workplaces often tried to present themselves as some kind of alternative family.
    You had your “work husbands” and mandatory “team building” events. Of course,
    this all came at the expense of your loved ones at home, as you had to spend time
    away from them while doing all your office-based events and tasks.
