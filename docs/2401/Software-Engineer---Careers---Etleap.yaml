- en: Etleap came to be out of the frustration with how much effort is required to
    build and maintain robust data pipelines. We want to make data pipelines easy
    for data engineers and analysts, and so we are creating an intuitive ETL/ELT tool
    that makes it quick to integrate data from any source without writing code, and
    efficient to manage hundreds or thousands of data pipelines.

    that modern data teams depend on to create and operate their analytics infrastructure!
    It shouldn’t take a CS degree to build great data pipelines, and abstracting away
    the difficult parts is our mission.
