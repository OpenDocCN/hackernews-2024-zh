- en: I've been running Linux full-time pretty much since Valve released Proton. I
    remember submitting reports to [ProtonDB](https://www.protondb.com/) back when
    it was just a shared Google Sheet! In the years that followed I made it a point
    to test and report out on different games as new versions of Proton were released
    and support improved. I thought it important that we have a good data set for
    what worked and what didn't. Over those years I tested hundreds of games and submitted
    as many reports to the database.

  zh: 自从 Valve 发布了 Proton 以来，我基本上一直在全职使用 Linux。我还记得在 ProtonDB 只是一个共享的 Google 表时就向其提交报告！在接下来的几年里，我一直坚持测试和报告不同游戏在新版本的
    Proton 发布和支持改善后的情况。我认为我们有一个好的数据集来记录什么有效，什么无效是很重要的。在这些年里，我测试了数百款游戏，并向数据库提交了同样数量的报告。
- en: In thinking back over my gaming in 2023, however, I realized that I fell out
    of the habit of submitting reports because **I'm so used to Proton working that
    it's stopped occurring to me that it might not.**

  zh: 但是，回想起我在 2023 年的游戏经历时，我意识到我已经习惯了 Proton 总是能够运行，以至于我已经不再觉得它可能会失败。
- en: That doesn't mean that there aren't some games that don't work -- it simply
    means that the success rate that I used to have (maybe 30-50% on average) has
    risen high enough that I'm genuinely surprised if something doesn't work (it's
    probably somewhere around 95% for me now, though that's biased by the types of
    games that I play). I actually tried to remember the last game that *didn't* work,
    and I genuinely couldn't tell you what it was. Everything I've played recently
    has booted like it's native.

  zh: 这并不意味着没有一些游戏不能运行 —— 这只是意味着我曾经拥有的成功率（平均可能为 30-50%）已经提高到了足够高的程度，以至于如果某些东西不能运行，我会感到非常惊讶（对我来说，现在可能在
    95% 左右，尽管这受到我玩的游戏类型的影响）。我实际上试图回忆一下最后一款 *没能* 运行的游戏，但我真的告诉不出来是什么。我最近玩的每一款游戏都像本地游戏一样启动。
- en: Honestly, I genuinely don't even know which games are native and which run through
    Proton anymore. I've stopped caring!

- en: I got my Steam Deck halfway through 2022\. It was awesome, but it was definitely
    a bit rough around the edges. There weren't that many compatible games. The OS
    had some clunkiness. It matured though, and has gotten better. Among my friend
    group, I'm the only person who cares even a little bit about Linux. If you asked
    any of them to name three different Linux distributions they'd stare at you blankly
    because they wouldn't understand the question. Nevertheless, of my friends, SIX
    of them have Steam Decks and are now gaming regularly **on Linux.**

  zh: 我在 2022 年中旬得到了我的 Steam Deck。那太棒了，但它确实有些粗糙。兼容的游戏不是很多。操作系统有些笨重。然而，它已经成熟了，并且变得更好了。在我的朋友圈里，我是唯一一个稍微关心
    Linux 的人。如果你问他们中的任何一个列举三种不同的 Linux 发行版，他们会茫然不解，因为他们不理解这个问题。尽管如此，我的朋友中有六个人拥有 Steam
    Deck，并且现在定期 **在 Linux 上** 进行游戏。
- en: There are currently [~4,300 Deck Verified games](https://steamdb.info/instantsearch/?refinementList%5Boslist%5D%5B0%5D=Steam%20Deck%20Verified)
    and [~8,700 Deck Playable games](https://steamdb.info/instantsearch/?refinementList%5Boslist%5D%5B0%5D=Steam%20Deck%20Playable)
    according to Valve. On ProtonDB, ~8,600 games have been verified as working on
    Linux by at least three users, while ~19,700 games have been verified by at least
    one user. There is SO much variety available, and the speed with which we've gotten
    here has been pretty breathtaking.

    [~8,700 个可在 Deck 上游玩的游戏](https://steamdb.info/instantsearch/?refinementList%5Boslist%5D%5B0%5D=Steam%20Deck%20Playable)。在

- en: I don't want to proselytize too much, but if you have a general interest in
    gaming, you could probably switch over to Linux full time and be perfectly happy
    with the variety of games you have available to you. Not too long ago, making
    the jump felt like a huge sacrifice because you'd be giving up so much -- SO many
    games were incompatible -- but it no longer feels that way. You can transfer and
    most of -- probably almost all -- your library will still work! Also, if a particular
    game doesn't work, there isn't too much sting because, well, there are thousands
    of others you can give your attention to.

  zh: 我不想说教太多，但如果你对游戏有一般的兴趣，你可能完全可以全职转到 Linux 并对你可用的各种游戏感到非常满意。不久之前，转换感觉像是一个巨大的牺牲，因为你将失去很多东西
    —— 如此多的游戏是不兼容的 —— 但现在不再感觉如此。你可以转换，你的大部分 —— 可能几乎所有的 —— 游戏库仍然可以使用！此外，如果某个特定的游戏不起作用，也没有太多的困扰，因为，嗯，还有成千上万的其他游戏可以吸引你的注意力。
- en: If you have a specific game that you *must* play, then it's possibly a different
    story. If you love [*Destiny 2*](https://www.protondb.com/app/1085660), for example,
    then full-time Linux definitely is not for you. The same goes VR -- it's simply
    not up to snuff on Linux yet. There are other niches too that don't transfer over
    as well (modding, racing sims, etc.) so, of course, this isn't a blanket recommendation
    and everyone's situation is different.

  zh: 如果你有一个你*必须*玩的特定游戏，那么情况可能会有所不同。例如，如果你喜欢[*Destiny 2*](https://www.protondb.com/app/1085660)，那么全职使用
    Linux 绝对不适合你。同样适用于 VR —— 它在 Linux 上还没有达到要求。还有其他一些领域也不太适合转移到 Linux（如修改游戏、赛车模拟器等），所以，当然，这并不是一种全面推荐，每个人的情况都是不同的。
- en: But for a prototypical person who's just your sort of general, everyday gamer?
    It's reached a point where they could be very happy on Linux. In fact, as proven
    by my friends and their Steam Decks, it's reached a point where people can be
    gaming on Linux *and not even know they're doing that.* That's how frictionless
