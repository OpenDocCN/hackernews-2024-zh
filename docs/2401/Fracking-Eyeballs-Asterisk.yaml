    small number of folks who did stop and look did tend to get a bit more interested
    when the hidden experimenter threw the lever and dropped into view the two ads

    Wheeler Scripture）在他所著的一章中提到了注意力，这章内容表明广告人在实际理解（和操纵）眼球方面领先于实验室心理学家。斯克里普特认为，心理学家需要做更多的实验室工作，以便能够回馈那些在吸引注意力方面具有深厚专业知识的人们。
- en: It seems likely that Scripture’s thinking inspired the younger Yale- and Leipzig-trained
    psychologist Harlow Gale, who in the closing years of the nineteenth century (while
    based at the University of Minnesota), undertook what seems to be the earliest
    documented laboratory experiments on print ads by configuring an incandescent
    flash chamber in which subjects were exposed to a momentary glimpse of a magazine
    spread, and then asked to report on what they noticed. He and his colleagues conducted
    more than three thousand iterations of this test, on more than a dozen subjects,
    under conditions set up (as Gale explained) “to obtain as nearly as possible in
    an experiment the conditions of rapidly turning the leaves of a magazine to see
    what would catch one’s attention.” Already, then, by 1900, laboratory scrutiny
    of eyes and minds had turned to what Gale called the “attention value” of particular
    parts of a page, of particular kinds of font, and of various hues.

    a set of his columns on “The Psychology of Advertising,” which ran in the industry
    rag *Mahin’s Magazine*, and published them as *The Theory and Practice of Advertising*
    (1903). If Scott was steeped in the experimental psychological tradition that

    business, he explained, the “aim of every advertisement is to attract attention.”
    And attention was, he proceeded to note, a topic on which psychology (“the newest

    of attention to another.  Perhaps most importantly, attention, as the psychologists

- en: If, then, there are multitudes of things to be attended to and we are unable
    to attend to more than four at once, why do we attend to certain things and disregard

    a part) is the way that the rapidly institutionalizing science of human attention
    adroitly seconded itself to a vast and dynamic emerging commercial program: psychology,

    things to our attention — because the psychologists understood the characteristics

- en: As to the specifics, one rather suspects that the admen nodded along, feeling
    that all this was rather commonsensical. But the words of Dr. Scott were, nevertheless,
    the blessing of science upon their from-the-hip practices. Moreover, Scott did
    actually lay out a number of ads and subject them to a “psychological” critique: 
    Why put a big picture of a slimy frog in a magazine pitch for White Star Coffee?
    Frogs don’t drink coffee. And coffee isn’t made from frogs either. No connection.
    Scott thought that such “irrelevant cuts” were a mistake. Sure, a frog on its
    hind legs, looking debonair, might (in its very oddness) attract the eye, but,
    in Scott’s view, such tripe made the ad itself harder to understand. (Interestingly,
    actual experiments, done a bit later, by another advertising psychologist, demonstrated

    — 记住这一点，因为我们将回到它。）

- en: Herman Francis Brandt, the psychologist who developed this device, borrowed
    cutting edge techniques from several contemporaries as he refined his portable
    and relatively robust system. It had been known for decades that it was possible
    to shine a bright beam of light obliquely at a human eye, and to translate the
    reflection of this light into spatial information about the direction of the gaze.
    If the front of the eye were perfectly spherical, this would not work. But it
    isn’t, and what Brandt called the “protuberance” of the front of the cornea meant
    that the physical surface of the eye effectively “pointed” in the direction of
    the sightline.

  zh: 心理学家赫尔曼·弗朗西斯·布兰特（Herman Francis Brandt）是这一装置的开发者，他从几位同时代的先驱者那里借鉴了尖端技术，使得他的便携式、相对坚固的系统得以完善。几十年来人们已经知道，可以将一束明亮的光线斜射到人眼上，并将这束光的反射转化为关于凝视方向的空间信息。如果眼前是完全球形的，这种方法就行不通。但实际情况并非如此，布兰特称之为角膜前突的“突出部分”意味着眼球的物理表面实际上“指向”视线的方向。
- en: It was by no means easy to get accurate information about this vector from a
    tiny spot of reflected light, but it could be done. Instrument designers in this
    period could not, of course, make use of laser-light. Instead, the light of an
    arc lamp, condensed via a series of lenses to pencil-point fineness, was used
    to create a corneal reflection sufficiently bright to be recorded on slow-moving
    film-stock, mounted in a motion picture camera off to the side of the subject’s
    line of sight.

- en: 'Brandt’s device made use of this established technique, but he was able to
    make a number of improvements on the exceedingly finicky and expensive systems
    of corneal reflection that had hitherto been reserved for highly specialized laboratory
    work. Systems like these depended on the head of the subject remaining perfectly
    stationary throughout the recording process. There was no way to distinguish between
    deflections of the corneal reflection caused by positional readjustment of the
    actual eyeball (moving your eyes), and those resulting from general motion of
    the head or body. Brandt incorporated into his system a clever technique for getting
    around this problem: a small reflecting bead was positioned  on the forehead of
    the subject, and a secondary beam of oblique light recorded the physical displacement
    of this bead, which thus served as an index for the physical movements of the
    head itself. Inscribing those movements made it possible to correct the eye-tracking
    data for extraneous physical movements.'

    没有办法区分角膜反射的偏转是由于实际眼球的位置调整（移动眼睛）引起的，还是由于头部或身体的一般运动引起的。 布兰特在他的系统中采用了一个巧妙的技巧来解决这个问题：在受试者的额头上放置了一个小的反光珠，并且一个斜光束记录了这个珠子的物理位移，从而作为头部自身物理运动的指标。
    记录这些运动使得可以校正眼动追踪数据中的外部物理运动。
