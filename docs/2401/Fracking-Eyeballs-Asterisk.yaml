    absurd manikin in the window (it can be discerned in the lower right of the first
    image, its face a scale reduction of that of the window display itself). “This
    mannikin held a placard which announced in very small type that this was ‘The

    small number of folks who did stop and look did tend to get a bit more interested
    when the hidden experimenter threw the lever and dropped into view the two ads
    to be tested, this led Nixon to other worries: yes, testing people in a lab meant

    was a cozy connection warmed across the early decades of the twentieth century.
    It was out of this marriage that the concatenation of attention and value first
    emerged  As early as 1895, one of the mainstays of the Leipzig-trained progenitors
    of academic psychology in the United States, Edward Wheeler Scripture, who held
    a post at Yale, had written a book chapter on attention that suggested ad-men
    were ahead of laboratory psychologists in the practical understanding (and manipulation)
    of eyeballs. Scripture felt the psychologists needed to do more lab work in order
    to be able to give something back to those who had deep lay expertise in attention
    capture.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It seems likely that Scripture’s thinking inspired the younger Yale- and Leipzig-trained
    psychologist Harlow Gale, who in the closing years of the nineteenth century (while
    based at the University of Minnesota), undertook what seems to be the earliest
    documented laboratory experiments on print ads by configuring an incandescent
    flash chamber in which subjects were exposed to a momentary glimpse of a magazine
    spread, and then asked to report on what they noticed. He and his colleagues conducted
    more than three thousand iterations of this test, on more than a dozen subjects,
    under conditions set up (as Gale explained) “to obtain as nearly as possible in
    an experiment the conditions of rapidly turning the leaves of a magazine to see
    what would catch one’s attention.” Already, then, by 1900, laboratory scrutiny
    of eyes and minds had turned to what Gale called the “attention value” of particular
    parts of a page, of particular kinds of font, and of various hues.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One very early adopter of Gale’s scientific approach to advertising was the
    “attention wave” psychologist Walter Dill Scott, yet another Leipzig-trained experimentalist.
    Sidling up to the booming world of the Chicago admen circa 1900, Scott gathered
    a set of his columns on “The Psychology of Advertising,” which ran in the industry
    rag *Mahin’s Magazine*, and published them as *The Theory and Practice of Advertising*
    (1903). If Scott was steeped in the experimental psychological tradition that
    had worked so hard to time and test human attention, his book pivoted from the
    laboratory “slicing” and “dicing” attention to the marketplace problem of pricing
    this new and valuable social commodity.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The longest chapter of *The Theory and Practice of Advertising* was titled,
    predictably, “Attention.” In it, Scott aligned the primary research problem of
    early twentieth-century psychology with the essential stuff of the commercial
    advertiser. Regardless of the various ways one might characterize the world of
    business, he explained, the “aim of every advertisement is to attract attention.”
    And attention was, he proceeded to note, a topic on which psychology (“the newest
    of the experimental sciences”) had been hard at work for some time. What could
    the scientists of the mind offer to the practical money-men working up new shills
    for their clients?

    because people could only pay attention to a relatively small number of things
    (Scott cited experiments that suggested ordinary people can attend to about four
    words, presented at a flash); and attention to any one thing came at the expense
    of attention to another.  Perhaps most importantly, attention, as the psychologists
    had parsed it, could be voluntary or involuntary. And this was key. Because the
    kind of attention that mattered for the admen was the involuntary kind. Here is
    how Scott put it:'

    adroitly seconded itself to a vast and dynamic emerging commercial program: psychology,

    things to our attention — because the psychologists understood the characteristics
    of involuntary attention in an intimate and technical way.'

    that all this was rather commonsensical. But the words of Dr. Scott were, nevertheless,
    the blessing of science upon their from-the-hip practices. Moreover, Scott did
    actually lay out a number of ads and subject them to a “psychological” critique: 
    Why put a big picture of a slimy frog in a magazine pitch for White Star Coffee?
    Frogs don’t drink coffee. And coffee isn’t made from frogs either. No connection.
    Scott thought that such “irrelevant cuts” were a mistake. Sure, a frog on its
    hind legs, looking debonair, might (in its very oddness) attract the eye, but,
    in Scott’s view, such tripe made the ad itself harder to understand. (Interestingly,
    actual experiments, done a bit later, by another advertising psychologist, demonstrated
    that this was probably false — remember this point, since we’ll return to it.)

    titled “The Relative Merit of Advertisements: A Psychological and Statistical
    Study” — a work that was built out of close experimental comparisons of different
    kinds of print advertisements, with a view to providing systematic advice to admen
    on optimizing their solicitations.  At Columbia, Strong found a number of senior
    psychologists who encouraged and facilitated his research into the science of
    commercialized attention. His direct advisor, James McKeen Cattell, had been one
    of the first American psychology researchers to be cited in Germany in connection
    with research on “Attention Waves.” And Cattell had also pioneered, just a few

    cutting edge techniques from several contemporaries as he refined his portable
    and relatively robust system. It had been known for decades that it was possible
    to shine a bright beam of light obliquely at a human eye, and to translate the
    reflection of this light into spatial information about the direction of the gaze.
    If the front of the eye were perfectly spherical, this would not work. But it
    isn’t, and what Brandt called the “protuberance” of the front of the cornea meant
    that the physical surface of the eye effectively “pointed” in the direction of
    the sightline.
  prefs: []

- en: It was by no means easy to get accurate information about this vector from a
    tiny spot of reflected light, but it could be done. Instrument designers in this
    period could not, of course, make use of laser-light. Instead, the light of an
    arc lamp, condensed via a series of lenses to pencil-point fineness, was used
    to create a corneal reflection sufficiently bright to be recorded on slow-moving
    film-stock, mounted in a motion picture camera off to the side of the subject’s
    line of sight.

    make a number of improvements on the exceedingly finicky and expensive systems
    of corneal reflection that had hitherto been reserved for highly specialized laboratory
    work. Systems like these depended on the head of the subject remaining perfectly
    stationary throughout the recording process. There was no way to distinguish between
    deflections of the corneal reflection caused by positional readjustment of the
    actual eyeball (moving your eyes), and those resulting from general motion of
    the head or body. Brandt incorporated into his system a clever technique for getting
    around this problem: a small reflecting bead was positioned  on the forehead of
    the subject, and a secondary beam of oblique light recorded the physical displacement
    of this bead, which thus served as an index for the physical movements of the
    head itself. Inscribing those movements made it possible to correct the eye-tracking
    data for extraneous physical movements.'

- en: 'At the start of the twentieth century, Walter Dill Scott concluded his many-times
    republished book *The Theory of Advertising* with a friendly gesture directed
    at his practical readers — the ad-men and business folks he hoped would pick up
    his volume. “The successful advertiser,” he explained, “must be a psychologist.”
    Half a century later, the careers of men like Faison and Brandt rather suggested
    the obverse: to be a truly successful psychologist, one had to be an advertiser.
    Or at least in advertising. Across those fifty years, the technical study of human
    attention in psychological laboratories came to be operationalized in the quest
    for the essential commodity of a consumer culture that took shape across the rise
    of mass media: attention.'
