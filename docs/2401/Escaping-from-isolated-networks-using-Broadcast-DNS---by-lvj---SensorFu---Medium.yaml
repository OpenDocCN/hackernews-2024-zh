- en: One of our latest escape methods is the capability send Domain Name System (DNS)
    queries via a broadcast ethernet packet. We call this the Broadcast DNS escape.
    Our hypothesis was that DNS server or cache could pick those up from the network
    and happily redirect it to another network.

    DNS finding real issues in real networks.

- en: Our client updated Beacons on their site to the latest version which added our
    new Broadcast DNS test. After the upgrade we were alerted that the Beacon had
    leaked from the site using this new escape.
  id: totrans-10

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Beacon was deployed in a production network — a network to monitor and control
    industrial processes — and the DNS resolver was properly segmented in the DMZ
    area. The DNS servers on their site were on a different IP subnet than the Beacon.
    Beacon had not leaked with unicast DNS before as the firewalls were blocking the
    traffic between the Beacon and the DNS servers. So how could the DNS leak out
    via broadcast?
  id: totrans-11
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One possibility was that the isolated network containing the Beacon and the
    network containing the DNS resolvers were accidentally connected together. This
    might happen due to incorrect cabling or VLAN settings. Networks connected together
    at ethernet level could forward ethernet frames within those unintentionally connected
    networks allowing the Beacon to reach the local DNS resolver via broadcast. This
    means that the networks are not isolated and the segmentation has failed.
  id: totrans-12

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Other possibility is that the network has an unknown DNS resolver which accepts
    the broadcasted DNS query and is allowed to forward it towards the upstream resolver.

- en: After investigating the finding it was discovered that the network actually
    had an old and supposedly decommissioned Microsoft Active Directory (AD) server
    still powered on in the network. That AD server also acted as a DNS server which
    happily processed the broadcasted DNS packets and forwarded them to the upstream
    DNS infrastructure. Firewall also had a rule to allow DNS traffic out from that
    particular DNS server.

- en: Another Broadcast DNS escape case soon followed. The company has been using
    Beacon for over a year now in a production site, deployed in production and IT
    networks. After upgrading the Beacons to the latest version an unexpected broadcast
    DNS escape was observed from the Beacon deployed in the isolated production network.
    In this case the logical hypotheses were the same; unknown DNS resolver in the
    production network or that the switched network is somehow connected to another
    network which has a DNS resolver processing and resolving the packet.

  zh: 另一个广播 DNS 逃逸案例很快就出现了。该公司在生产环境和 IT 网络中已经使用 Beacon 一年多了。在将 Beacon 升级到最新版本后，意外地观察到了在隔离的生产网络中部署的
    Beacon 发出的广播 DNS 逃逸。在这种情况下，逻辑假设是相同的；生产网络中存在未知的 DNS 解析器，或者交换网络以某种方式连接到另一个具有处理和解析数据包的
    DNS 解析器的网络。
- en: After notifying the customer, they quickly investigated the issue and found
    indications that there were two networks accidentally connected together. Two
    networks being connected together, the broadcast packets sent by the Beacon in
    the isolated production network reached the IT network containing the DNS resolver
    which then forwarded the query to the upstream DNS resolvers all the way to the
    Beacon Home. The switch ports connecting the networks were identified and the
    networks disconnected after which the Beacon stopped calling Home.

  zh: 在通知客户后，他们迅速调查了该问题，并发现有迹象表明有两个网络意外连接在一起。两个网络连接在一起后，隔离的生产网络中的 Beacon 发出的广播数据包到达包含
    DNS 解析器的 IT 网络，然后将查询转发到上游 DNS 解析器，一直到达 Beacon Home。确定了连接网络的交换机端口，并在断开网络连接后，Beacon
    停止了对 Home 的呼叫。

  zh: 思后记
- en: This kind of broadcast packets (be it DNS, ICMP or something else) take advantage
    of a weakness in TCP/IP network stacks. The ethernet layer takes the broadcast
    packet and allows it to flow up in the stack to the next network layer. Then the
    next layer inspects their part of the packet and acts accordingly, completely
    missing the fact that it was a broadcast packet and maybe not intended for them
    to process.

  zh: 这种广播数据包（无论是 DNS、ICMP 还是其他什么）利用了 TCP/IP 网络堆栈的弱点。以太网层接收广播数据包并允许其在堆栈中向上流动到下一个网络层。然后，下一层检查数据包的部分并相应地采取行动，完全忽视了这是一个广播数据包，也许不是打算供它们处理的。
