    have grown increasingly alienated from institutions of higher education. Confidence
    in colleges and universities is now sharply polarized by party; between 2015 and
    2023, [Gallup found](https://news.gallup.com/poll/508352/americans-confidence-higher-education-down-sharply.aspx#:~:text=In%20the%20June%201%2D22,some%20and%2022%25%20very%20little.)
    that the share of Republicans expressing “a great deal” or “quite a lot” of confidence
    in higher education fell by 37 percentage points. As conservatives have come to
    look negatively at these institutions,Republicans have increasingly engaged in
    political attacks on the sector, most recently, in the fact-finding and pressure
    campaign that caused Claudine Gay to resign this week as president of Harvard.

    of certain kinds of speech about Israel, and they have broader objections to DEI
    and the adoption of more explicitly left-wing institutional positions at universities
    well beyond Harvard. But what they found, when searching for dirt on her, was
    unrelated to all of this: she plagiarized, repeatedly, in her body of academic
    work. She copied paragraphs of text nearly wholesale, without quoting the scholars
    whose text she used, and sometimes without even citing them. Anyone who *went*
    to college knows you’re not allowed to do that. It’s not just a rule — it’s a
    rule that universities are obsessed with and borderline sanctimonious about. They
    beat into students’ heads that they must correctly attribute their sources. If

    be inappropriate and unethical, as it promotes a negative and harmful activity.”

    a university president stay in place when she’d done things the university kicks

    about why it’s losing public trust — again, as I discussed at the top, not just
    among conservatives — and what it could do to be more deserving of it. After all,
    if the strategy is simply to polarize views about universities and turn them into
    a liberal cause célèbre, that’s not only going to be a disaster for university
    budgets in red states; it doesn’t even look like it’s working as a strategy to
