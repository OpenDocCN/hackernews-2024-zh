    have grown increasingly alienated from institutions of higher education. Confidence
    in colleges and universities is now sharply polarized by party; between 2015 and
    2023, [Gallup found](https://news.gallup.com/poll/508352/americans-confidence-higher-education-down-sharply.aspx#:~:text=In%20the%20June%201%2D22,some%20and%2022%25%20very%20little.)
    that the share of Republicans expressing “a great deal” or “quite a lot” of confidence
    in higher education fell by 37 percentage points. As conservatives have come to
    look negatively at these institutions,Republicans have increasingly engaged in
    political attacks on the sector, most recently, in the fact-finding and pressure
    campaign that caused Claudine Gay to resign this week as president of Harvard.

    like to *talk* about themselves as a vanguard in a fight against conservative
    know-nothings who would take down knowledge and expertise, there is no pro-college
    backlash among liberals that is apparent in the polls. So it would behoove the
    champions of knowledge and research and expertise and truth at our nation’s elite
    universities to be a little less [entitled and whiny](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/03/opinion/claudine-gay-harvard-president.html),

    at Harvard, graduating in 2005\. Most of my coursework was in social psychology.
    And something I keep seeing in the news since I graduated is that a decent amount
    of what I was taught in Harvard’s social psychology courses was just wrong. At
    the time I was a student, there was a vogue for this whole body of research about
    how “priming” and little behavioral nudges can materially affect attitudes and
    behavior, but the studies I learned about in class [keep getting debunked](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2018/11/psychologys-replication-crisis-real/576223/),
    with replications failing and the studies often having been p-hacked or even based
    on fraudulent data. The widespread research dishonesty in psychology stemmed from
    poor incentives — interesting findings get published, publications get you funding
    and job security and notoriety and sometimes even corporate consulting contracts,and
    it’s easier to produce an interesting finding if you juke your data — and was
    made possible by lax practices that prevailed until recently, including researchers
    not having to pre-register their study endpoints and not being expected to share
    their raw data for review by others.

    HBS nor the journals that published Gino’s research would ever have noticed that

    is often *faculty* who are trying to safeguard their fields from the progressive
    machinations of their bureaucratic overlords. But faced with a choice between
    watching their departments shrink or agreeing to hire in areas that help realize

    in hiring, universities can’t explicitly admit to setting positions aside for
    candidates from underrepresented minorities. So, instead they use ideological
    screens and DEI statement reviews as a proxy for race. This approach has many
    drawbacks — in addition to involving a dishonest concealment of the university’s
    true objectives, it is of no use to black and Hispanic candidates who are not
    interested in “ideologically supercharged” areas of study, and sometimes it leads
    to the hiring of white candidates anyway, if they know best how to include the
    magic trendy words in a DEI statement. Harper has more to say about non-racial
    reasons why university administrations push the humanities in these directions
    — he says selling students the unfounded hope that the humanities will make them
    more effective social activists is one way to get them to enroll, for example
    — but none of it speaks well of universities’ commitment to honest research and

    about admissions. Harvard has had a longstanding practice of using race as a factor
    in college admissions, producing a class that is less Asian and more black and
    Hispanic than it would be if they did not consider race. And they also have a
    longstanding practice of lying about it. Throughout the litigation over Harvard’s
    admissions policies, they didn’t just defend the appropriateness of race-conscious
    policies to promote diversity; [they denied that they were discriminating at all](https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/20/20-1199/230739/20220725122633156_20-1199%20bs.pdf).
    They played word games — similar to the “what even is plagiarism?” bit deployed
    by Gay’s defenders — arguing somehow that race could be used as a positive factor
    for admission without ever being a negative one, a mathematical impossibility
    when awarding a fixed number of admission slots.

    talking about affirmative action. Affirmative action policies prefer personnel
    of certain racial and ethnic backgrounds as part of an effort to alter the institution’s
    demographic balance — *this is the point of affirmative action* — but apparently
    it’s racist to admit this is what’s happening (or sometimes it would constitute
    an admission of illegal activity) so there’s a bunch of obfuscatory fudging of
    what the universities are really up to when they look at race. And since the Supreme
    Court’s ruling last year prohibiting race-conscious admissions practices, institutions
    across the country have been blatantly obvious about their search for ways to
    flout the law. It’s dishonest and, in the last few years, it’s been all over the
