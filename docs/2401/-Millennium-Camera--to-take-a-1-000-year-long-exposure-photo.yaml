- en: What did the spot of land you’re currently on look like 1,000 years ago? Well,
    people in the year 3023 might have the luxury of finding out, thanks to an art/science
    project called the Millennium Camera, which will take an extremely long-exposure
    photo of the Arizona desert.

- en: The brainchild of Jonathon Keats, an experimental philosopher at the University
    of Arizona College of Fine Arts, the Millennium Camera is an intriguing experiment
    with a noble, if somewhat naive, goal. The device will take the world’s slowest
    photo over a full thousand years, providing future inhabitants of Tucson, Arizona
    with a time capsule of what’s changed and what hasn’t.

- en: To project into the future, Keats looked to the past. The Millennium Camera’s
    design is that of a [pinhole camera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinhole_camera),
    the very first kind invented – coincidentally, around 1,000 years ago. It’s a
    copper cylinder with a thin sheet of 24-karat gold at one end, in which a tiny
    hole has been punched. Sunlight seeps through that hole and shines on a light-sensitive
    surface at the back, which has been coated in multiple thin layers of an oil paint
    pigment called rose madder.

    a neighborhood of Tucson. The idea is that the controlled light exposure will
    slowly fade the pigment to different degrees – darker areas, such as the mountains,
    will fade slower than brighter areas like the sky. If all goes as planned, the
    end result will be a millennium-long exposure photo.

    will invoke some squinting in the future humans (or their alien overlords). But,
    Keats says, that’s part of the charm – the most stable elements, like the scenery,
    will stand bold, while the changing objects, like buildings, will be partly transparent,
    based on how long they’re there. It’s kind of a comment on the impermanence of
    humanity, really.

    in the future,” said Keats. “What will happen then is the mountains will be clear
    and sharp and opaque, and the housing will be ghostly. All change will be superimposed
    on one image that can be reconstructed layer by layer in terms of interpretation
    of the final image.”

    That’s a lot of time for a natural disaster to knock it over, or for somebody
    to hock the copper cylinder. The area might be bulldozed to build an apartment
    block in 2245\. Humanity could go extinct. Or even if it does survive, the experiment’s
    purpose could simply be lost to time, leaving our distant descendants scratching
    their space helmeted heads over an underwhelming image of abstract art.

    it’s not just intended to help our great-great-great (etc) grandkids to ponder
    the past – in the meantime it will also inspire people of the present to think
    about the future. The device is installed near a bench on a hiking trail on Tumamoc
    Hill, next to a sign explaining its purpose. Hikers could look out over the valley
    while they stretch and sip water, and wonder what the view would look like in
    3023.

- en: “Most people have a pretty bleak outlook on what lies ahead,” said Keats. “It's
    easy to imagine that people in 1,000 years could see a version of Tucson that
    is far worse than what we see today, but the fact that we can imagine it is not
    a bad thing. It's actually a good thing, because if we can imagine that, then
    we can also imagine what else might happen, and therefore it might motivate us
    to take action to shape our future.”

    directions, as well as in Griffith Park in Los Angeles, China and the Austrian
    Alps.
