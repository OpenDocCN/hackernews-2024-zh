    that owns and develops a suite of category-leading consumer products including
    Remini (an AI-powered photo enhancer), Splice (a mobile video editor), and Evernote
    (a personal productivity app).

    with the Meetup community personally: on Friday, January 5, Bending Spoons entered
    into an agreement to become the new owner of Meetup, subject to closing conditions.
    The acquisition is expected to close later in January.'

    that resonates strongly. Quite simply, Meetup is a force for good in the world,
    and it’s a pleasure and a privilege to become the new steward. We’re eager to
    support Meetup’s future success by drawing from the expertise we’ve developed
    in a decade of building high-performing digital technology products.

    future plans. In the meantime, I want to congratulate the Meetup team on building
    such a wonderful, beloved product. And I want to thank you, the organizers and
    members, for embracing Meetup and its mission so enthusiastically. We can’t wait
    to get to work on this exciting project!
