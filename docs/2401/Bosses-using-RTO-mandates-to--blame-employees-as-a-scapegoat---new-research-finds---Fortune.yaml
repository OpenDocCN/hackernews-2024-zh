    at just shy of 50% since vaccines were made widely available.

    recovery. And many others aren’t giving up, despite Kastle’s evidence; 64% of

    by Mark (Shuai) Ma, an associate professor at the University of Pittsburgh, and
    Yuye Ding, a PhD student at its Katz Graduate School of Business, found that an
    office return isn’t actually boosting a company’s bottom line. What’s more: Many
    bosses simply carried out mandates in an effort to regain control over an employee
    base they could no longer see—or, as it were, trust.'

    an S&P 500 firm’s decision to mandate a return to office and what the consequences
    are—and aren’t. The researchers assembled their report by manually collecting
    RTO mandate data from over 100 firms, and then working backwards to assess what
    underpinned the decision. They first looked at why some firms wanted to impose
    mandates and others didn’t, Ma tells *Fortune.* “We were able to see three foundations:
    What managers say, what employees say, and what experts say.”'

    he’s gathered is that bosses want employees where they can see them because they’re
    not performing well at home, which in turn hurts firm performance. It’s a thin
    argument, Ma says, and his research proves no link between work location and firm
    financial results.

- en: Then there’s employee sentiment, which is often at odds. “Many [workers] say
    an RTO mandate is about control, not performance,” Ma says. They see their managers
    as being used to a traditional workplace in which they can see their orders being
    carried out, and losing that has made them uneasy, and quick to place blame.

    that is mostly determined by individual workers and teams. Additionally, experts
    prioritize meaningful in-office work—gathering with colleagues for collaboration,
    team bonding, and ideating, not just because it’s how things used to be done.

    intent of an RTO mandate, despite many managers suggesting it is. Not only did
    the researchers find that RTO mandates fail to significantly change financial
    performance or stock value, it does little more than rankle employees and tank
    their satisfaction.

    control over their employees, who they then go on to blame if they fall below
    shareholder expectations.

    mandates to increase firm values,” he wrote. “Instead, these findings are consistent
    with managers using RTO mandates to reassert control over employees and blame
    employees as a scapegoat for bad firm performance.”

    November—and Ma quoted in the report—RTO mandates are little more than an attempt
    to convince investors that decreased revenue and profitability “aren’t a result
    of poor managerial decisions but the result of lazy workers sitting at home in
    their pajamas.” Zitron calls it “a genius move” on executives’ part, because it
    lets them “establish control over workers during an unprecedented societal awareness
    of labor rights…while also shifting the blame and consequences of poor stock performance
    onto those least responsible.”

    improve firm value or performance, such mandates would look different. They’d
    “be higher among managers with a stronger incentive to maximize firm value—owners,
    those with more stock or ownership of their firm, whose interest is more aligned
    with firm interest,” Ma says.

    each of the goals managers say they’re meant to accomplish in the first place.
    “People will leave their jobs, and it’s never been easier for people to find other
    jobs that *do* let them work flexibly,” Ma says. “But we don’t have a long enough
    window to see long-term consequences.”

    approach to work arrangements for companies who want some form of balance. That
    approach encourages workers to go back to an open, flexible workplace without
    forcing their hand. As for the many remote workers who insist they’re better off
    staying put, “there’s no reason to force them back.”

    levels](https://fortune.com/2023/07/06/remote-workers-less-productive-wfh-research/)
    among in-person workers. “Even if some employees were more productive in the office
    before the pandemic, that doesn’t necessarily mean they would become more productive
    when they return to office after the pandemic,” he wrote. “This is because they
    are more likely to react negatively to being forced to work in the office after
    enjoying the benefits of WFH.”
