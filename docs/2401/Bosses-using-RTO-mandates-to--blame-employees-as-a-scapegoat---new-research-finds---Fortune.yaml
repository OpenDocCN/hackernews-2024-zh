    an S&P 500 firm’s decision to mandate a return to office and what the consequences
    are—and aren’t. The researchers assembled their report by manually collecting
    RTO mandate data from over 100 firms, and then working backwards to assess what
    underpinned the decision. They first looked at why some firms wanted to impose
    mandates and others didn’t, Ma tells *Fortune.* “We were able to see three foundations:

- en: What managers say, Ma explains, is usually the farthest off the mark. Tthe sentiment
    he’s gathered is that bosses want employees where they can see them because they’re
    not performing well at home, which in turn hurts firm performance. It’s a thin

    说，并且他的研究没有证明工作地点与公司的财务结果之间存在联系。
- en: Then there’s employee sentiment, which is often at odds. “Many [workers] say
    an RTO mandate is about control, not performance,” Ma says. They see their managers
    as being used to a traditional workplace in which they can see their orders being

- en: Ma concludes that performance and shareholder value isn’t the real overarching
    intent of an RTO mandate, despite many managers suggesting it is. Not only did
    the researchers find that RTO mandates fail to significantly change financial
    performance or stock value, it does little more than rankle employees and tank
    their satisfaction.

    November—and Ma quoted in the report—RTO mandates are little more than an attempt
    to convince investors that decreased revenue and profitability “aren’t a result
    of poor managerial decisions but the result of lazy workers sitting at home in
    their pajamas.” Zitron calls it “a genius move” on executives’ part, because it
    lets them “establish control over workers during an unprecedented societal awareness
    of labor rights…while also shifting the blame and consequences of poor stock performance
    onto those least responsible.”

    中在11月份写道的，并且Ma在报告中引用了他的话，返办公政策不过是一种企图说服投资者减少的收入和盈利不是由于管理不善而是由于那些穿着睡衣在家里懒散的员工引起的。“这是高管们的一招妙计”，因为这让他们在人们对劳工权益的认识前所未有的社会中“建立对工人的控制……同时将差劲的股票表现的责任和后果转嫁给那些最不负责任的人。”
- en: But if the managers were actually viewing RTO mandates solely as a method to
    improve firm value or performance, such mandates would look different. They’d
    “be higher among managers with a stronger incentive to maximize firm value—owners,
