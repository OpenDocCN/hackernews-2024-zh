# RAWRLAB Games - Announcement of free Godot™ engine port for Nintendo Switch™

> 来源：[https://www.rawrlab.com/godot_nintendo_switch_free_port.html](https://www.rawrlab.com/godot_nintendo_switch_free_port.html)

**· Did RAWRLAB Games create this port?**
No. As it was stated in the announcement, this port is “co-authored by multiple members of the forums on the Nintendo Developer Portal”. We are just one of its contributors.

**· I am not a Nintendo authorised developer. How can I download it?**
As it was stated in the announcement, this port is only available to Nintendo Switch authorised developers.

**· Is it an official port maintained by Godot Foundation?**
No.

**· Will this ruin porting houses?**
Quoting Juan Linietsky: “Not really, it’s really nice this exists because it allows small indies to tinker with Godot on the platform. W4 ports are more complex and meant for actual studios.”. We agree with him.

**· · Does this port mean I won’t need help from a porting company?**
Well, not exactly. This port just solves one piece of a 10-piece puzzle. Porting a game to a gaming console requires a lot of work and knowledge about the platform to optimize it and comply with its requirements.

**· I have some concerns about this port and liability. Will I be in legal trouble if I use this port to release a game on Nintendo Switch?**
We don’t think so, but in doubt please ask your lawyer.

**· What does “basic functionality” mean? Does this port support X feature?**
It’s hard to say, but have a look at the games that were already released. “Those games work well”, that’s what we can say.

**· Will this port ever include X feature? Will it support future versions of Godot?**
Who knows. But every time a game is published with this port it grows a bit, thanks to every contribution.

**· How can this port be MIT licensed if it can’t be distributed out of the Nintendo Developer portal?** This port is licensed under the MIT License, which is known for being highly permissive. This means **it allows for free redistribution, but does not require it. Access to this port is exclusive to developers authorised by Nintendo**, available through the Nintendo Developer Portal. Therefore, due to the terms of their agreement with Nintendo, **developers are not permitted to disclose this port without Nintendo's prior authorization**.

**· Could it be distributed publicly if the SDK function names are replaced with hashes?**
It might be feasible, but it’s in the grey area.

**· Will there maybe also be a PS and XBOX port?**
I don’t know, but I hope so. UWP was good enough for porting small games to Xbox, but it has been deprecated.

**· How can I donate/contribute to this port?**
You can donate here: [https://fund.godotengine.org/](https://fund.godotengine.org/)

**· No, seriously, how can I repay you and the other contributors?**
If you ever use this port, you will probably add a missing feature or fix a bug or two. That will be your contribution!
