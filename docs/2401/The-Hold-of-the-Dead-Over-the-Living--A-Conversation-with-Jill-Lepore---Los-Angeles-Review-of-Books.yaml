    clownish techno-futurists, “spin,” and “truthiness,” but also of the ingenious
    engineers who created the internet, and the investigative reporters gumshoeing

    tipped the scales in any given direction—and does so with verve and even hope
    because, as Lepore says, “you can’t successfully make a better future if you’re
    convinced that the future is terrible.”*'

    rejects the idea of objectivity and even the very notion of empiricism. A similar
    transformation has taken place in journalism. You could date the current iteration
    of the struggle over the practice of history to the Tea Party movement; there
    has been a really weird and crude version of American history that operates as
    a political narrative to justify a set of political commitments on the right.
    I think of the Tea Party movement as a marriage of populism and originalism. It
    has a pretty big cultural and political hold right now, but its idea of history

    of the transformation of the elemental unit of knowledge across the history of
    the West, from “mystery” to “the fact” to “numbers” to “data.” “Mystery” is what
    God knows but humans can’t know. And for a lot of human history, much of how things
    happen in the natural world was mysterious to us (like where does life come from?
    What happens when we die?), leaving us with great humility and incredible vulnerability.
    Many of these things are still mysteries, but a lot of things have been revealed,
    like how disease is transmitted. The emergence of what historians call “the cult
    of the fact” is associated with the beginnings of trial by jury, which starts
    in the 13th century when ordinary people are charged with hearing evidence given
    by two sides in a dispute and determining the verdict, which means the truth is
    based on the presentation of facts, or observed acts.

    “神秘”是上帝知道但人类无法知晓的事物。在很大程度上，人类历史上的许多自然界发生的事情对我们来说是神秘的（比如生命从何而来？死后会发生什么？），这使我们感到非常谦卑和极其脆弱。这些事情中的许多仍然是神秘的，但很多事情已经被揭示，比如疾病是如何传播的。历史学家所称的“事实崇拜”的出现与陪审团开始的时期有关，陪审团起源于13世纪，当时普通人被指定听取争议双方提供的证据并裁定胜负，这意味着真相基于事实的陈述或观察行为。

    depends on the idea of the fact, journalism comes to depend on the idea of the

    with the development of the social sciences. All kinds of things can be quantified,
    and by counting things you get a whole new way of knowing. And in the 19th and
    20th centuries, you start to see the emergence of the preference for the elemental
    unit of knowledge being “data”—by which, in this context, I mean quantification
    that requires a machine to do it. Data becomes preferable to facts because facts
    require the human acts of observation, deduction, reasoning, and conclusion. Data
    doesn’t require any of those things. It doesn’t require humans. It just requires
    the accumulation and analysis of numbers. And the objective of the cult of data
    is not truth, the objective of the cult of the fact, but prediction, because the
    work is all about pattern detection. If you reorganize all of humanity around
    prediction, and yet people can’t actually undertake those predictions—those predictions
    are all offered by machines—we have returned, in a sense, to the age of mystery,

  zh: 是第一本讲述人类被一场流行病驱使灭绝的书籍——是人类进步的倒退史，是人类退步的故事。随着流行病夺走越来越多的世界人民和民族，他们的人性逐渐向下退化。事情沦为暴力和武力统治，而不是理性的统治，男人通过绑架和强奸统治女人，再也没有农业，人类最后的残余只剩下牧羊人。我们的主角，他想做的事情——然后这就成为了所有这些小说中发生的事情——是保存一座图书馆，找到并收集一座图书馆，以便如果人类有一天再次繁荣发展的能力，人类历史的所有知识不会消失。这就是艾萨克·阿西莫夫的

  zh: 互联网是人类智慧的惊人产物，也是一个不可思议的档案馆。但从历史学家的角度来看，互联网的困难之处在于它没有实现民主化的承诺，不仅是我们的政治，还有历史记录。
- en: '**A recurring theme in your collection is our perception of the future. For
    example, you write in “No, We Cannot” (2017)—a play on Barack Obama’s “Yes We
    Can”—that dystopias were once “a fiction of resistance,” and have since “become
    a fiction of submission, the fiction of an untrusting, lonely, and sullen twenty-first
    century” that “cannot imagine a better future.” That essay reminded me of your
    argument in “In Every Dark Hour” (2020) that losing democracy is not something
    that happens to us but is instead something that we let happen. Do you think we
    need a new American story to help us imagine a better, more hopeful future?**'

  zh: 你的作品集中经常出现的一个主题是我们对未来的感知。例如，在“不，我们不能”（2017年）中你写道——这是对巴拉克·奥巴马“是的，我们能”的戏仿——反乌托邦曾经是“一种抵抗的虚构”，而如今已经“成为一种屈从的虚构，一个不信任、孤独和郁郁寡欢的21世纪的虚构”，这个21世纪“无法想象一个更美好的未来”。那篇文章让我想起了你在“在每个黑暗的时刻”（2020年）中的论点，即失去民主不是发生在我们身上的事情，而是我们自己选择的事情。你认为我们需要一个新的美国故事来帮助我们想象一个更美好、更充满希望的未来吗？
- en: When I wrote “No, We Cannot,” dystopian fiction was very hot. There was and
    is this radical pessimism that is shot through American life. I teach 18-year-olds
    and they’re really pessimistic. That’s new. There’s a lot to be pessimistic about,
    but it’s also a cultural posture that we’re stuck in. You know that game you play
    as a kid where you line up like the game of statues where you have to freeze in
    place? It’s like we’re all in this game of statues in this pose of greatest possible
    despondency. I wonder what shakes that out because you can’t successfully make
    a better future if you’re convinced that the future is terrible. It’s partly why
    I wrote a 1000-page history of the United States a few years ago to address all
    the things we talked about earlier. When I started the book, I had planned to
    end it with Barack Obama’s inauguration. It was a great ending that had a “ta-da”
    feeling. But then I was halfway through writing the book when Donald Trump was
    elected. I was getting memos from my kids’ school district superintendent saying
    children will be in mourning and we need to help them deal with their trauma and
    grief over this election. And it was like, I mean, he’s a horrible person, he’s
    going to be a terrible president, but what are we talking about? Like we all need
    psychotherapy for our children because of this guy? It was just so weird.

  zh: 当我写下“不，我们不能”的时候，反乌托邦小说非常火爆。美国生活中充斥着一种激进的悲观主义。我教18岁的学生，他们真的很悲观。这是新的。有很多值得悲观的事情，但这也是我们困在其中的一种文化姿态。你知道小时候玩的那个游戏吗？就像玩雕像游戏一样，你必须定住不动？就好像我们都在这个雕像游戏里摆着最可能绝望的姿势。我想知道是什么让这种情绪消失了，因为如果你相信未来是可怕的，那就不可能成功地创造一个更美好的未来。这在几年前部分是我写了一本1000页的美国历史书的原因，以解决我们之前谈到的所有问题。当我开始写这本书时，我计划以巴拉克·奥巴马的就职典礼结束它。这是一个伟大的结局，有一种“咔嚓”的感觉。但是当我写了一半书的时候，唐纳德·特朗普当选了。我收到了我孩子学校区主任的备忘录，说孩子们将处于哀悼状态，我们需要帮助他们处理这次选举带来的创伤和悲伤。这就像，我是说，他是一个可怕的人，他会成为一个糟糕的总统，但我们在谈论什么？就像我们所有人都需要为我们的孩子接受心理治疗因为这个家伙？这太奇怪了。
- en: And I then had to change the ending of the book. I had to end with Trump’s election
    instead of with Obama’s inauguration. And I was pretty full of despair. So I went
    to a department meeting where you can workshop and I workshopped the epilogue
    to the book. I have a real commitment to hope in this Obama-like way, the audacity
    of hope, but in my own other way too, and I felt like the book, which was going
    to be for young people, needed to end on some hopeful note. And yet, I couldn’t
    really see it. And we went around the room and I asked the faculty to come up
    with something that they are hopeful about. This was the Harvard history department.
    Nobody could come up with anything, other than really slender reeds. It’s hard.
    It’s very hard. But I do think it’s important to recognize that when it’s fashionable
    to be despairing, it requires a certain amount of contrariness and courage to
    be hopeful. And I’m always up for that.

  zh: 然后我不得不改变书的结尾。我不得不以特朗普的当选结束，而不是以奥巴马的就职典礼结束。我感到非常绝望。所以我参加了一个部门会议，在那里你可以讨论问题，我讨论了书的附录。我对希望有真正的承诺，就像奥巴马那样，有希望的大胆，但也是以我自己的其他方式，我觉得这本书，它将是给年轻人看的，需要以一些充满希望的音符结束。但是，我真的看不到。我们走进房间，我让教职员工提出他们对什么感到有希望。这是哈佛历史系。除了真的很细的芦苇之外，没有人能提出任何东西。这很困难。这非常困难。但我认为认识到当人们流行绝望时，需要一定的反对和勇气来保持希望。而我一直都在。
