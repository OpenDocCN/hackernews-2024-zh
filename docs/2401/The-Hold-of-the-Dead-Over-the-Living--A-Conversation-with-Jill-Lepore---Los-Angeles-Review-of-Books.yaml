    like a time, felt like history.”* *But Lepore’s United States is not merely bleak—it
    is multifaceted, evolving, complicated. It is at once “held hostage” to its history,
    but also full of potential for “generativity and invention.” It is the home of
    clownish techno-futurists, “spin,” and “truthiness,” but also of the ingenious
    engineers who created the internet, and the investigative reporters gumshoeing
    through city halls. Lepore strives to understand the transformations that have
    tipped the scales in any given direction—and does so with verve and even hope
    because, as Lepore says, “you can’t successfully make a better future if you’re
    convinced that the future is terrible.”*'

    the Supreme Court is hearing oral arguments on the question of whether people

    and always changing. The field of academic historical inquiry derives from an
    18th-century notion of empiricism that was professionalized in the 19th century
    and has been called into question in the 21st century by a call for advocacy that
    rejects the idea of objectivity and even the very notion of empiricism. A similar
    transformation has taken place in journalism. You could date the current iteration
    of the struggle over the practice of history to the Tea Party movement; there
    has been a really weird and crude version of American history that operates as
    a political narrative to justify a set of political commitments on the right.
    I think of the Tea Party movement as a marriage of populism and originalism. It
    has a pretty big cultural and political hold right now, but its idea of history
    is to academic history what astrology is to astronomy or alchemy is to chemistry.
    By which I mean, it is bunk.

    watching and observing the gap between the kinds of history books that you could
    buy at Barnes & Noble and the kinds of history that we cared about. A lot of that
    Barnes & Noble stuff was a kind of David McCullough, “great man” biography. But
    the history that we cared about was the story of ordinary people. And you could
    tell that story only in the aggregate through the methods of social history, like
    looking at the ages and lengths of stay of the poor who were confined in poor
    houses, or you might learn about infant or maternal mortality rate. But even if
    you wanted to, you couldn’t write a McCullough-style character-driven novelistic
    account of one of those lives because you just don’t have that texture in the
    archive. And that is why you read Jane Austen instead, right? Or Dickens. It tells
    you about those lives. But we were so frustrated by the rich complexity of knowledge
    of the lives of ordinary people and what was left out by the publishing juggernaut.

    to the historical record as an intellectual constraint. Sometime after that, I
    wrote a biography of Benjamin Franklin’s sister Jane, who was a poor woman in
    Boston in that same time period, and I think writing the novel was really fruitful
    because it gave me a different literary sensibility in how I wrote about Jane
    Franklin. But I think that the line between history and fiction is a really interesting

    very unsettling moment of, wow, what if policymakers are creating an alternative

    political power, but some of it was also about technological anxiety. The year
    2005 would have been about nine years into the existence of the internet, and
    we were on the cusp of social media. That looks like a pretty stable moment relative
    to where we are now: deepfakes, zero accountability for lying to run for office,
    the commodification of misinformation. We have been living for decades with a
    major industry, fossil fuels, just deliberately lying about the consequences of
    much of the world economy and how it operates. So, shaking in our boots is where

- en: For years, I have taught a class at Harvard Law School called the history of
    evidence. In the course of teaching that class, I developed a theory with my students
    of the transformation of the elemental unit of knowledge across the history of
    the West, from “mystery” to “the fact” to “numbers” to “data.” “Mystery” is what
    God knows but humans can’t know. And for a lot of human history, much of how things
    happen in the natural world was mysterious to us (like where does life come from?
    What happens when we die?), leaving us with great humility and incredible vulnerability.
    Many of these things are still mysteries, but a lot of things have been revealed,
    like how disease is transmitted. The emergence of what historians call “the cult
    of the fact” is associated with the beginnings of trial by jury, which starts
    in the 13th century when ordinary people are charged with hearing evidence given
    by two sides in a dispute and determining the verdict, which means the truth is
    based on the presentation of facts, or observed acts.
  prefs: []

- en: 'The “fact” transformed all kinds of realms of knowledge: the scientific revolution
    depends on the idea of the fact, journalism comes to depend on the idea of the
    fact, and histories tend to understand themselves as compilations and interpretations
    of facts. The “number” begins to vie alongside the fact in the 18th and 19th centuries
    with the development of the social sciences. All kinds of things can be quantified,
    and by counting things you get a whole new way of knowing. And in the 19th and
    20th centuries, you start to see the emergence of the preference for the elemental
    unit of knowledge being “data”—by which, in this context, I mean quantification
    that requires a machine to do it. Data becomes preferable to facts because facts
    require the human acts of observation, deduction, reasoning, and conclusion. Data
    doesn’t require any of those things. It doesn’t require humans. It just requires
    the accumulation and analysis of numbers. And the objective of the cult of data
    is not truth, the objective of the cult of the fact, but prediction, because the
    work is all about pattern detection. If you reorganize all of humanity around
    prediction, and yet people can’t actually undertake those predictions—those predictions
    are all offered by machines—we have returned, in a sense, to the age of mystery,
    because in an age of data, only computers can really know things. So we are as
    vulnerable as we were in a prescientific, pre-Enlightenment world. It’s a really
    weird kind of reversal.'

    to be for young people, needed to end on some hopeful note. And yet, I couldn’t

    with something that they are hopeful about. This was the Harvard history department.
