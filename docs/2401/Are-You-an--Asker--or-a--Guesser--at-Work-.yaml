- en: The concept of “ask culture” and “guess culture” has fascinated me for years.
    Andrea Donderi named the phenomenon in a [2007 MetaFilter post](https://ask.metafilter.com/55153/Whats-the-middle-ground-between-FU-and-Welcome#830421).
    Many [thought](https://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2010/05/askers-vs-guessers/340891/)–[provoking](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2010/may/08/change-life-asker-guesser)
    [essays](https://newrepublic.com/article/74900/ask-dont-guess) have explored the
    idea’s role in fouling up interpersonal relationships since.

- en: Guessers are prone to perceiving needs around them and proactively addressing
    those needs before an “ask” is made of them. Askers, by contrast, wait until something
    is asked of them to act. While guessers live in fear of making a request that
    might be denied, askers are happy to ask for what they want and need and don’t
    think anything of being turned down.

    asking and guessing and how it applies to the workplace. But I do think the concept
    is fun to play with and can be illuminating around interpersonal tension—which,
    of course, occurs at work.

    appreciate anything I do”? Or, “Why can’t he just say what he means instead of
    embarrassing me after the fact?” That can be a good moment to consider whether
    you two might be on opposite sides of the asking/guessing divide.

    beyond their comfort zone to communicate more directly. They’ll get to benefit
    from doing fewer mental gymnastics.  On the flip side, askers trying to accommodate
    the needs of guessers might need to stretch their powers of inference.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    “Did I ever really say plainly what I wanted to the person?” and answer honestly.
    This is different from, “Did I spend a lot of time thinking about what I wanted
    and wishing they could pick up on that through subtlety? Was I hoping they would
    read between the lines, even if my hints seemed obvious to me?”

- en: Often, guessers [live in personal fear](https://spin.atomicobject.com/fuda-irl/)
    of failing to perceive and meet someone else’s needs. For them, the idea of the
    person they are trying to accommodate asking them for something they need is akin
    to deep embarrassment. This is not how askers see social interactions. They are
    not paying attention to what you might need; they are waiting for you to advocate
    for yourself.

    not think you have a choice besides saying yes. Your asker boss might just be
    throwing out an idea, waiting for you to counter if you have a constraint. He
    may easily accept a suggestion for a later deadline.

    on the side of what you might consider bluntness bordering on rudeness gets you.
    You’re likely putting too much energy into what you think of as tact or diplomacy,
    and it’s going over the asker’s head.

- en: When working with a guesser, it helps to run through a series of internal questions
    before and after you make decisions together. These might include something like,
    “What do I know about what is going on in this person’s work life that might add
    context to the decision?” or, “When this person offers to make an additional effort,
    is that a subtle sign to encourage me to make a similar offer?” or “Does the distribution
    of work we agreed to seem fair and equitable?”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: While you’re in the interaction with the guesser, use your powers of active
    listening. Broaden your awareness beyond just what they say. Also look for subtle
    clues around body language, tone of voice, eye contact, and word choice to see
    what’s below the surface. If you think you’ve caught an implication, try asking
    probing questions like, “It occurs to me that you might be feeling a little stressed
    about what’s on your plate right now. Do you think this plan is coming together
    in a sustainable way for you?” This gives them an invitation to verbalize what
    they may haven’t felt safe to say.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Similarly, wield your direct asks carefully when you’re working with guessers.
    It’s not safe to assume, especially if you have greater institutional power, that
    your colleague will interpret the request with the optionality you intend. Instead
    of asking in your natural phrasing, try peppering in softeners to create room
    for freer dialog. That might look like the difference between, “Can you get this
    done by Monday?” vs. “I don’t assume you have the capacity, but if you do, would
    it be feasible to complete this project by Monday?”

    Askers and guessers need not abandon their strengths to better communicate with

    can be less bewildered or frustrated—and more effective at navigating interpersonal
    conflict at work.
