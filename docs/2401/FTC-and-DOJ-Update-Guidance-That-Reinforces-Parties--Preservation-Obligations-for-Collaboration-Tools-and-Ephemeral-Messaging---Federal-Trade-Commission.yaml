- en: The Federal Trade Commission and Justice Department today announced that both
    agencies are updating language in their standard preservation letters and specifications
    for all second requests, voluntary access letters, and compulsory legal process,
    including grand jury subpoenas, to address the increased use of collaboration
    tools and ephemeral messaging platforms in the modern workplace. These updates
    reinforce longstanding obligations requiring companies to preserve materials during
    the pendency of government investigations and litigation.

    when involved in government investigations or litigation in order to promote efficient
    and effective enforcement that protects the American public. Today’s update reinforces
    that this preservation responsibility applies to new methods of collaboration
    and information sharing tools, even including tools that allow for messages to
    disappear via ephemeral messaging capabilities,” said FTC Bureau of Competition
    Director Henry Liu.

    nor their clients can feign ignorance when their clients or companies choose to
    conduct business through ephemeral messages,” said Manish Kumar, Deputy Assistant
    Attorney General of the Justice Department’s Antitrust Division. “The Antitrust
    Division and the Federal Trade Commission expect that opposing counsel will preserve
    and produce any and all responsive documents, including data from ephemeral messaging
    applications designed to hide evidence. Failure to produce such documents may
    result in obstruction of justice charges.”

- en: Companies continue to adopt new technologies to do their work, and in recent
    years there has been an increase in use of collaboration tools and ephemeral messaging
    applications, such as Slack, Microsoft Teams, and Signal. Some of these technologies
    allow, or even automatically enable, immediate and irretrievable destruction of
    communications and documents. Documents created through use of these technologies
    have long been covered by FTC and DOJ document requests. However, companies have
    not always properly retained these types of documents during government investigations
    and litigation.
