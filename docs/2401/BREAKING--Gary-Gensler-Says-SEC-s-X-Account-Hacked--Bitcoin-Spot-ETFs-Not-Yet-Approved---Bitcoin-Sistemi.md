According to the SEC chairman's statement, the post announcing the approval of Bitcoin Spot ETFs was made by the hacker who took over the SEC's official X account.

So currently Bitcoin Spot ETFs have not received official approval. On the other hand, the relevant confirmation post was deleted from the SEC's Twitter account.

Gensler said the following in the development he shared on his official X account:

“The SEC Twitter account was compromised and an unauthorized tweet was posted. The SEC has not approved the listing and trading of products traded on the spot Bitcoin exchange.”
