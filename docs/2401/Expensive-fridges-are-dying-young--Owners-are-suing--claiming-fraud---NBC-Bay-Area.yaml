- en: “It’s a nationwide issue,” said Los Angeles attorney Azar Mouzari. She represents
    plaintiffs who are now suing LG. She says her firm is focused on a critical part
    called the [linear compressor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lsrYCBPReE) inside
    LG and some Kenmore refrigerators. “Which is really the heart of the refrigerator,"
    Mouzari said. "It’s what keeps the food cold.”

- en: According to LG literature, the linear compressor uses less energy and makes
    less noise than other compressors. LG offers a 10-year warranty and, online, boasts
    “20-year durability.” But Mouzari argues in the lawsuit the linear compressor’s
    actual lifespan is nowhere near 10 years, let alone 20\. Her suit claims they
    frequently break down far earlier — and LG knows it.

    failures. In 2020, [LG settled a different, class-action lawsuit](https://www.lgfridgesettlement.com),
    covering people who bought select models between Jan. 1, 2014 and Dec. 31 2017\.
    Mouzari’s suit is new. And it makes a new claim: fraud. She argues in the suit
    that LG is defrauding people like Betsy Anderson -- who bought after 2018 -- because
    LG continues to make a linear compressor that falls short of its “20-year durability.”'
