- en: “It’s a nationwide issue,” said Los Angeles attorney Azar Mouzari. She represents
    plaintiffs who are now suing LG. She says her firm is focused on a critical part
    called the [linear compressor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lsrYCBPReE) inside
    LG and some Kenmore refrigerators. “Which is really the heart of the refrigerator,"
    Mouzari said. "It’s what keeps the food cold.”

- en: According to LG literature, the linear compressor uses less energy and makes
    less noise than other compressors. LG offers a 10-year warranty and, online, boasts
    “20-year durability.” But Mouzari argues in the lawsuit the linear compressor’s
    actual lifespan is nowhere near 10 years, let alone 20\. Her suit claims they
    frequently break down far earlier — and LG knows it.

    because she believes droves of families are facing the same breakdown. “Thousands,
    if not tens of thousands,” she said. “We have been inundated with calls.”

    failures. In 2020, [LG settled a different, class-action lawsuit](https://www.lgfridgesettlement.com),
    covering people who bought select models between Jan. 1, 2014 and Dec. 31 2017\.
    Mouzari’s suit is new. And it makes a new claim: fraud. She argues in the suit
    that LG is defrauding people like Betsy Anderson -- who bought after 2018 -- because
    LG continues to make a linear compressor that falls short of its “20-year durability.”'
