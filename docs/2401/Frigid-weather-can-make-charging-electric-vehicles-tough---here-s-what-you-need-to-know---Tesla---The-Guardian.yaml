    stations on Wednesday as the wind howled with a temperature of 7F (-14C). At least
    one driver was nearly out of juice.

- en: It is well known that EVs lose some of their travel range in the cold, especially
    in subzero temperatures like those that hit the nation’s mid-section this week.
    Studies found that range loss varies from 10% to 36%. EVs also do not charge as
    quickly in extreme cold. Some Tesla owners near Chicago told reporters their cars
    would not charge at all.

- en: Inside EV batteries, lithium ions flow through a liquid electrolyte, producing
    electricity. But they travel more slowly through the electrolyte when it gets
    cold and do not release as much energy. That cuts into the range and can deplete
    a battery faster.
  prefs: []

- en: The same happens in reverse. Since electrons move more slowly, the battery cannot
    accept as much electricity from a charging plug. That slows down charging. The
    problem is that when temperatures plunge, batteries have to be warm enough for
    the electrons to move. And they have to be even warmer at fast-charging stations
    like Tesla’s.

    Arbor, the battery in Ankita Bansal’s Tesla had only 7% of its charge left. She
    plugged in, but the car wouldn’t take electricity. Instead, the display said the
    battery was heating up. After it hits the proper temperature, it would take an
    hour and 50 minutes to get to a full charge, the display said.

    weather. The car, she said, will tell you where charging stations are and how
    much range you have left. “The more you drive it the more you’re comfortable knowing
    how far you can go and how much to charge it,” she said. Burney said she loses
    roughly 15% to 20% of her battery range in cold weather, but it gets dramatically
    worse in cold snaps like the one this week.

- en: In the short term, Dasgupta said that as more mainstream consumers buy EVs,
    and as more automakers enter the market, they will develop models using existing
    lithium-ion chemistry that are tailored to colder climates. In some cases overall
    range might have to be sacrificed a little to get better cold-weather performance,
    he said.
