    brick themselves and the manufacturer claims that''s because you''ve interfered

- en: This talk will tell the story of a series of Polish EMUs (Electric Multiple
    Unit) that all refused to move a few days after arriving at an “unauthorized”
    service company. We'll go over how a train control system actually works, how
    we reverse-engineered one and what sort of magical “security” systems we actually
    found inside of it.

    running `unlock.py` on a dozen trains.

- en: The talk will be a mix of technical and non-technical aspects of analysis which
    should be understandable for anyone with a technical background. We’ll briefly
    explain how modern EMUs look like inside, how the Train Control & Monitoring System
    works, and how to analyze TriCore machine code.
