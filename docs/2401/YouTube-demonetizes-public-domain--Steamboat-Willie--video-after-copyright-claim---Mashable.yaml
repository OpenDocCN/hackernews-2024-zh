    you should certainly pay attention to.

- en: On Thursday, voice actor and YouTuber Brock Baker uploaded a new video, titled
    "Steamboat Willie (Brock's Dub),"  to his YouTube channel with more than 1 million
    subscribers.

- en: The video contains the entirety of the 1928 Disney animated short "Steamboat
    Willie," with Baker providing his own comedic voice overs and sound effects throughout
    the less than 8 minute long cartoon.

- en: According to Baker, shortly after uploading the clip though, YouTube [demonetized](https://twitter.com/BrockBaker/status/1743009587475665205
    "(opens in a new window)") the video, evidently on behalf of the erstwhile copyright
    owner, Disney. Baker also shared a screenshot to his X account showing the video
    was also being blocked from view in some territories as well.

    protective of its copyrighted works and would likely be especially so of a film
    like *Steamboat Willie* as it stars its most iconic character, Mickey Mouse.

    the public domain](https://mashable.com/article/mickey-mouse-steamboat-willie-disney-public-domain)
    on January 1, 2024\. This means that a video like Baker's should be completely
    fine for the YouTuber to not only create and distribute, but monetize as well.

- en: Baker could likely make a fair use or parody defense for his dubbed version
    of *Steamboat Willie*, but as Duke University's Jennifer Jenkins, a professor
    of law teaching intellectual property, [told Mashable this week](https://mashable.com/article/mickey-mouse-steamboat-willie-public-domain-so-far),
    he doesn't even need to make that argument. Public domain works are considered
    public property.

- en: As soon as "Steamboat Willie" became public domain earlier this week, multiple
    different creative projects using the iconic mouse were announced. Some of these
    creative works include a [horror movie](https://variety.com/2024/film/news/steamboat-willie-horror-film-mickey-mouse-public-domain-copyright-1235849861/
    "(opens in a new window)") and a [video game](https://mashable.com/article/infestation-88-steamboat-willy-horror-game).

- en: So, what happened with Baker's video? Mashable has reached out to YouTube to
    find out more information and will update this post when we hear back. However,
    due to how quickly Disney's copyright claim was issued after Baker uploaded his
    "Steamboat Willie" video, it's likely the video was a victim of the automated
    Content ID process.
  prefs: []

- en: '"Videos uploaded to YouTube are scanned against a database of audio and visual
    content that''s been submitted to YouTube by copyright owners," reads YouTube''s
    policy page on its [Content ID](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2797370?hl=en
    "(opens in a new window)") feature. "When Content ID finds a match, it applies
    a Content ID claim to the matching video."'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If this is the case, YouTube nor Disney appear to have updated the database
    to remove works that have recently entered the public domain. And, if so, it seems
    that should certainly be programmed into the Content ID system as an automated
    process, much like the valid claims are.
