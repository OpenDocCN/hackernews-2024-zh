    things. I’m not sure why that is, but it’s more often than not the case. The ability
    to do scary things on their behalf is extremely powerful, both in terms of advancing
    the goal/project and also getting them to better utilize their talents.'

- en: For example, you will find that a lot of talented or intelligent people are
    scared of cold emailing or just do a really bad job at it. Offer to do this work
    for them, and by offer I mean just do it. Send the cold email, get the response
    and then tell them about it*. They will be really impressed and have an incentive
    to get the ball rolling on said project. They might end up so impressed that they
    also stretch the initial goal of the project!

    an imposter because the work doesn’t feel hard, and therefore you’ll assume it
    is not valuable in the grand sheme of things. This is not true. By being audacious
    on these peoples behalf you will make them, and therefore the work you both do
    together, a reality. Talented and smart people tend to have the technical ability
    to do work, but often lack the courage or audacity to actually do it. Pushing
    them to make it a reality is a very big deal, so don’t underestimate that.

    especially if they don’t know how to code. There is no proven course or guide
    written to do this either so its even harder to do, which is what makes this a
    great opportunity for you to shine. If you teach yourself how to do so you are
    not only in a unique position to set the standard for other people to learn (write,
    write, write about what you have learnt!) but you also get to apply this skill
    set on behalf of super smart or talented people who most likely wouldn’t have
    done so due to lack of time, skepticism or both. Again, do and show the results,

    time on average to complete a task. And that’s okay. Just be aware of this and
    put in the extra time and effort to not only produce at a good pace but produce
    above standard. Again, most smart or talented people can produce above standard
    with much less effort than you. But sometimes they don’t do so because they don’t
    see a clear reward at the end. Try to counteract this and put in the extra effort.

    are arbitrary, and smart & talented people know this. They will still work to
    the deadline but they may not feel a real sense of urgency to move faster. Try
    to counteract this energy. I’m not sure why but moving faster increases the likelihood
    that work will actually get done, and also opens you up (and therefore the team)
    up to a lot more opportunities along the way. Most likely because you are “prepared”
    when you meet luck, or something along those lines. Anyways.'

    people often want to do creative work, that involves inventing or discovering.

    make sure you (they) are always moving one leg in front of the other so that shit
    is actually getting done at a fast pace. Otherwise, you will find that you have
