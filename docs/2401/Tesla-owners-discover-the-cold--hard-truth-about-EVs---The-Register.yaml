- en: So why is this happening? The problem is that battery basics simply do not work
    well in freezing conditions. Ions inside EV batteries travel between the positive
    and negative electrodes through a liquid electrolyte. As it gets colder, that
    liquid, at least in most lithium-ion batteries, thickens, meaning the ions move
    more slowly. The slower the ions move, the greater the resistance. The greater
    the resistance, the faster an electric vehicle loses power.

  zh: 为什么会发生这种情况呢？问题在于，电池基础知识在寒冷条件下表现不佳。EV电池内的离子通过液态电解质在正负电极之间移动。随着温度变冷，至少在大多数锂离子电池中，液体变得更加粘稠，这意味着离子移动速度变慢。离子移动得越慢，电阻就越大。电阻越大，电动汽车失去动力的速度就越快。
- en: The solution is to keep the battery warm, but the heat comes from the battery
    itself, so these stricken Tesla drivers are draining the battery just to be able
    to charge the battery, and we don't need to explain why that might be inefficient.
