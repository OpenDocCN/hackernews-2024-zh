    of certain electric vehicles, particularly Teslas.

    dipped way below freezing, local media reported public charging stations turning
    into "car graveyards" because motorists were unable to power their vehicles.

    station that worked in the freezing cold.'

    were missing a trick. "Like any new technology, there's a learning curve for people,"
    he told Fox 32\. "It's not plug and go. You have to precondition the battery,
    meaning that you have to get the battery up to the optimal temperature to accept
    a fast charge."

    looking at Tesla's own "[Cold Weather Best Practices](https://www.tesla.com/ownersmanual/models/en_us/GUID-F907200E-A619-4A95-A0CF-94E0D03BEBEF.html#:~:text=If%20you%20leave%20Model%20S,for%20any%20length%20of%20time.)"

    departure," it reads. "Preconditioning times depend on outside temperature and
    other factors. The mobile app will notify you once your vehicle has reached the
    desired preconditioning temperature."'

    charging conditions," the document continues. "If the drive to the charging location
    is less than 30-45 minutes, consider preconditioning the Battery before driving."'

    well in freezing conditions. Ions inside EV batteries travel between the positive
    and negative electrodes through a liquid electrolyte. As it gets colder, that
    liquid, at least in most lithium-ion batteries, thickens, meaning the ions move
    more slowly. The slower the ions move, the greater the resistance. The greater
    the resistance, the faster an electric vehicle loses power.

    itself, so these stricken Tesla drivers are draining the battery just to be able
    to charge the battery, and we don't need to explain why that might be inefficient.

    for instance, propose a "Liquefied Gas Electrolyte" that "liquefies under pressure,
    enabling several safety and performance benefits," including a wider operational
    temperature range of -60°C to 60°C. Meanwhile, Korean company LG Chem is developing
    new electrode chemistry and architectures with a view to improve charging times
    and temperature performance. Tesla is also trying to develop battery technology,
    though its next-gen 4680 cells are [proving difficult to mass produce](https://cleantechnica.com/2023/12/24/tesla-4680-battery-production-is-trapped-in-production-hell/).

    may take years for the necessary improvements to come online but until then, the
    answer is simply not to drive during a deep freeze. ®
