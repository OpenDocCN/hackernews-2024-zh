    ever if it wants this $3,500 face computer to be a hit. Embracing the web will
    mean threatening the very things that have made Apple so powerful and so rich
    in the mobile era, but at least at first, the open web is Apple’s best chance
    to make its headset a winner. Because at least so far, it seems developers are
    [not exactly jumping](https://www.macstories.net/news/a-survey-of-popular-apps-currently-compatible-with-apple-vision-pro/)
    to build new apps for Apple’s new platform.

- en: Historically, Apple is unmatched in its ability to get app makers to keep up
    with its newest stuff. When it releases features for iPhones and iPads, a huge
    chunk of the App Store supports those features within a few weeks. But so far,
    developers appear to be taking their Vision Pro development slowly. Exactly why
    varies across the App Store, but there are a bunch of good reasons to choose from.
    One is just that it’s a new platform with new UI ideas and usability concerns
    on a really expensive device few people will have access to for a while. Sure,
    you can more or less tick a box and port your iPad app to the Vision Pro, but
    that may not be up to everyone’s standards.

- en: The bigger-picture reason is that Apple and its developers are increasingly
    at odds. Some of the high-profile companies that have announced they’re not yet
    building apps for the Vision Pro and its visionOS platform — [Netflix](/2024/1/17/24042179/netflix-apple-vision-pro-app),
    Spotify, [YouTube](/2024/1/18/24043540/youtube-spotify-apps-apple-vision-pro-visionos),
    and others — are the very same ones that have loudly taken issue with how Apple
    runs the App Store. Spotify has been railing against Apple’s 30 percent cut of
    in-app purchases for years. Netflix got a sweetheart deal from Apple years ago
    to share only 15 percent of revenue but has recently been refusing to participate
    in the Apple TV app’s discovery feature and has long since stopped allowing you
    to subscribe to Netflix from your iOS device. YouTube stopped allowing in-app
    purchases a few years ago and even canceled subscriptions people purchased in
    the App Store in order to get away from Apple’s commission.

    link out to other places users can pay for apps. [But Apple changed its terms](/2024/1/16/24040881/apple-outside-payments-app-store-policies-iphone-ipad)
    to say that, actually, even if someone clicks the link and subscribes through
    the web, developers still owe Apple a commission. Sure, it’s 27 percent instead
    of 30, but that’s not likely to change anyone’s mind. The message was clear: if
    you sell a product through the App Store, Apple will get its cut one way or another.'

    corporate infighting has the potential to completely change the way we use our
    devices, starting with the Vision Pro. It’s not like you *can’t* use Spotify on
    the headset; it’s just that instead of tapping a Spotify app icon, you’ll have
    to go to Spotify.com. Same for YouTube, Netflix, and every other web app that
    opts not to build something native for the Vision Pro. And for gamers, whether
    you want to use Xbox Game Pass or just play *Fortnite*, you’ll also need a browser.
    Over the last decade or so, we’ve all stopped opening websites and started tapping
    app icons, but the age of the URL might be coming back.

    more time on their web apps and less on their native ones, this is a big win for
    the future of the internet. (Disclosure: I believe all these things.) The problem
    is, it’s happening after nearly two decades of mobile platforms systematically
    downgrading and ignoring their browsing experience. You can create homescreen
    bookmarks, which are just shortcuts to web apps, but those web apps don’t have
    the same access to offline modes, cross-app collaboration, or some of your phone’s
    other built-in features. After all this time, you still can’t easily run browser
    extensions on mobile Safari or mobile Chrome. Apple also makes it maddeningly
    complicated just to stay logged in to the services you use on the web across different
    apps. Mobile platforms treat browsers like webpage viewers, not app platforms,
    and it shows.'

    give it access to some native features. It felt for years like Apple would happily
    ditch Safari altogether if given the choice; after all, it tightly controls everything
    about its platforms, and the web is an utterly uncontrollable place. But the company
    appears to be still invested in making Safari work. (All the [Safari-focused antitrust

    be able to open multiple windows at the same time and move them all around in
    virtual space. [A leaked video](https://www.inverse.com/tech/apple-vision-pro-safari-web-browser-video)
    recently showed a user manipulating a 3D object inside of a webpage. Apple engineers
    said at WWDC last year that they’ve completely redesigned the tab overview for
    visionOS, and they’ve also made some changes so the browser works both with touch
    and the eye-tracking and double-pinching mechanics that are core to visionOS.
    Apple has been warning developers to prepare their apps for all kinds of new screen
    sizes and layouts, as users do wacky stuff with their headsets. The company also
    confirmed that [it will support WebXR](https://www.roadtovr.com/apple-vision-pro-webxr-support-safari-model/),
    a protocol for browser-based VR that can be used for some impressively immersive

    its WebKit requirement for developers, which would mean other browsers could be
    built on other rendering engines. If and when that happens, you might be able
    to run full-fledged Chrome or Firefox on your Apple devices, potentially including
    the Vision Pro. That change, along with the increased attention on progressive
    web apps (PWAs) — the cross-platform, web-based apps that Android, Windows, and
    even Apple are starting to support more aggressively — could make your headset’s
    browser wildly more powerful practically overnight. With a good browser and powerful
    PWAs, many users might mostly not notice the difference between opening the Spotify
    app and going to Spotify.com. That’s a win for the whole web.

    useful and powerful from day one. Apple should embrace Safari, allow other desktop-class
    browsers, and treat the Vision Pro like the power user platform it is. No one
    has yet seen enough of Safari for visionOS to know if it is all of those things,
    though — and I’m not sure whether Apple wants it to be. Because here’s the real
    question for Apple: which is more important, getting the Vision Pro off to a good
    start or protecting the sanctity of its App Store control at all costs? As Apple
    tries to create a platform shift to face computers, I’m not sure it can have it
    both ways.'
