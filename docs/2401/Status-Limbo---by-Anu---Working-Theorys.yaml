    you land in *status limbo*.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I’ve visited status limbo a few times, each after a decision to pause or step
    off a well-regarded path to explore a drastically different one. This time around,
    it started when I decided to leave my most recent job, and that too, without a
    perfectly charted out next move.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Since then, I’ve been exploring new ideas as a founder and embracing a [new
    approach](https://www.workingtheorys.com/p/silicon-valley-small-business). I’ve
    also poured time into creative pursuits and personal goals. All of this has been
    incredibly fruitful, but hasn’t significantly moved me out of status limbo. To
    be honest, I haven't actively sought to escape it.
  prefs: []

- en: Nevertheless, there are moments when I'm reminded of where I am. It usually
    happens when someone asks, 'What are you working on right now?' or 'Are you still
    pursuing X?' or 'Do you miss doing Y?' Sometimes they ask directly, and other
    times, I hear it through the proverbial grapevine.

    for their remarkable achievements and inspiring journeys. Even if you don’t identify
    with this archetype, status limbo seems to be a universal human experience that
    we all have more than once in a lifetime.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    limbo can be an incredibly meaningful time of free exploration, personal development,
    and professional growth — and an all-around transformative period.

    both in your estimation and as perceived by others.**'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When in limbo, your status is challenging to pinpoint, both for yourself and
    those around you. And your future status is uncertain, with no visible path in
    front of you charting your next steps.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: While status limbo often entails a drop in status, it remains ambiguous and
    doesn't feel permanent. You don’t know exactly how far you’ve fallen, but if done
    well, your actions in limbo will help you escape it again, ideally with more.
  prefs: []

- en: '***Status limbo is a place with more freedoms than other states.*** It’s not
    freer in a tangible sense, but removing the usual status-preserving hangups lets
    you act more freely. It somewhat like being on the moon. There’s less societal
    and institutional gravity.'

    big status win, bypassing what you had before. Or you may emerge with similar
    or even a touch less status but as a happier, more internally-aligned person.
  prefs: []

- en: This is the allure of visiting status limbo. Taking the leap to take a sabbatical,
    change careers, start a startup, or shut down a startup all come with their own
    consequences, but the prospect of a win is compelling. At the same time, the reality
    of going through status limbo first subconsciously weighs on people.
  prefs: []

- en: Not long ago, I had a friend who was contemplating quitting their career in
    medicine to explore creative fields. But they were concerned about the questions
    “people” would ask. People had certain expectations of them. They would *wonder*.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This is one way you might choose to enter status limbo voluntarily (and hence
    it could be seen as a privilege). You quit a “prestigious” career that’s stable,
    lucrative, and praised by society. Apart from this, it’s also a big part of your
    personal and social identity, so that changes too.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Entering voluntary status limbo can be daunting even when you do it willingly.
    You might be surprised at how much or all the ways it ends up impacting you. But,
    the weaker the ties to the people you’re worried about, the more it’s usually
    *status* that concerns you more than something intrinsic. “People” is often a
    nice way of saying esteemed strangers.

    to be.”***'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I meant this on both macro and micro levels. You have to take risks. ***You
    have to be willing for “people” to think less of you, or at least be unsure what
    to think of you for a while.*** And for the people that *are* close to you, discuss
    it openly. You’ll likely get understanding and advice, making it less tempting
    to back out too. And in this process there’s a good chance you’ll find out who
    *really is and isn’t* so close to you too.

    being fired from their jobs. Of course the subjects seemed to have a clue it was
    coming, yet it still seemed like they were real-time processing a big shock.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Getting fired is one way to involuntarily enter status limbo. Sudden shifts
    in personal relationships, such as breakups or divorce, can also thrust you into
    it. Or a significant, unexpected financial loss can be the catalyst.
  prefs: []

- en: Involuntary status limbo often brings more perceived or real societal judgment.In
    contrast, voluntary entry doesn’t always carry the same judgment. For instance,
    entrepreneurship is often lauded, even though it pushes you into status limbo.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As an entrepreneur, the value of what you’re building is often uncertain, oscillating
    dramatically from day to day, week to week, or month to month. Financial stability
    is also in question if you haven’t yet banked a lucrative “win.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One challenge of being in status limbo is that, by nature, it means something
    else is also in limbo. The “riskier” the endeavor you undertake while in status
    limbo, the more unstable and uncertain your future and the timeline to exit this
    state.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The flip side is that if you take status limbo in stride, you might actually
    feel *relieved* of traditional status handcuffs. A lack of attention and anticipation
    from people can feel like freedom. Sometimes *that’s* when you try the most interesting,
    crazy-unique things.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'And in that flow, you find yourself doing things not purely for status, but
    because there’s something in them that’s *more meaningful* to you. As I’ve written
    before: *“To become truly great at something, you need to be at least a little
    obsessed with that thing — enough to get lost in the joy of doing it, not the
    allure of what it could get you.”*'

    existing status to make it back and more. This is especially true in creative
    fields and high-upside opportunities. Writers, musicians, actors, directors, entrepreneurs
    must all do their time in *status limbo*. And you don’t know how long that time
    will be. How well you tolerate this state can be the “winning” difference between
    you and someone just as talented and hard-working as you.'

    Status shields can help you defend against sudden drops, slow erosions, severe
    hits and all the rest. ***Status shields are the things that prop up your status.***

    and [trophy jobs](https://www.workingtheorys.com/p/trophy-jobs), to your ability
    to display your talents regardless of your current job status. At times, you can
    actively pursue status shields, such as taking a sabbatical while retaining formal
    employment or securing a prestigious fellowship that extends throughout your journey
    as a founder or the more dangerous — raising money from venture capitalists for
    signal more than need.
  prefs: []

- en: I have written about “minimum viable status” before, the idea that people want
    to accumulate a *threshold level* of status (especially within a certain community
    they care about) before they feel comfortable no longer playing status games to
    the same degree. This is a kind of status shield too, and though not idyllic,
    I think worth considering. Is there some minimum level above which you feel more
    comfortable taking a jump?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: All this said, status shields can just help reduce status anxiety, but they
    don’t ever cure it. And hoarding too many shields can ironically hinder you from
    reaping the rewards of going all-in.

    greater clarity and certainty. Big tech companies are status havens. Ivy League
    colleges or academic positions can be status havens. Any well-established, respected
    path in society can be a status haven. It could be something new too, like a startup,
    but one that people can easily identify as notable or valuable.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Sometimes, life itself compels you to seek a haven. Or you’ve grown tired of
    the constant ambiguity and uncertainty of being in status limbo. This transition
    often happens for entrepreneurs who've dedicated years to a startup without a
    big breakthrough or for creative professionals who must decide how long to pursue
    their dreams without big outcomes. There’s always temptation to seek a haven,
    but it can be dangerous to your future self to bail *too early*.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Getting kicked out of status limbo can happen suddenly or gradually. *Maybe
    something you created or undertook in limbo itself becomes the status haven.*
    This of course is the dream scenario. Or maybe your startup gets acquired in a
    hurry. Or perhaps the status ambiguity just decays over time. As you adapt to
    a new status setting, it *doesn’t feel like limbo* anymore. Someone whose status
    becomes *certainly uncertain* by logic becomes more certain.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '***Sometimes, leaving status limbo can be even more challenging than entering
    it.*** The difficulty lies in leaving behind or giving up the very reasons that
    led you there to start. You might come to the conclusion that this wasn’t the
    right time to visit status limbo, or that you need a break before you return (and
    this is ok if it’s thoughtfully-considered and not just a fear response). If you’ve
    accomplished your goals, the transition may be smoother, but if you haven’t, it
    can be a complex mix of rational and emotional decisions.'

    their life. This isn’t limited to a specific age group, gender, ethnicity, or
    socioeconomic class. In that way, status limbo seems like a universal human condition.
    It’s just that different people experience it at different times and deal with
    it differently.
  prefs: []

- en: For some, status limbo is a subtle undercurrent that they rarely notice and
    that minimally impacts their well-being. Others may be too acutely aware of it
    and wrestle with its implications. Undeniably, our society’s relentless pursuit
    of continuous achievement and status gains has taken a psychological toll, particularly
    on young, ambitious people. At the same time, we’ve seen that status isn’t permanent,
    and it seems progressively less enduring than it ever was.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In this light, we should fear status limbo much less than we tend to. Instead,
    we should accept its existence but view it as an avenue for personal exploration
    and growth. If you’re lucky, you’ll leave status limbo happier than when you arrived.
    Perhaps you’ll capture a big win or discover something profoundly meaningful about
    yourself. Either way, you’ll be much more prepared the next time you visit.
