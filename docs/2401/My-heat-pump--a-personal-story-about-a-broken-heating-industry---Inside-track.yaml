    An engineer was called, several cold days passed, and his declaration came in
    sombre tones: ‘uneconomic to repair’. Like [58% of new boiler purchasers](https://www.nesta.org.uk/interim-boilers-for-broken-heating/),
    I was cold and I wanted a quick fix. But I really didn’t want a new boiler, given
    most last for over a decade and produce two tonnes of CO2 per year. I wanted a
    heat pump.'

    some efficient windows, floor insulation, and draught-proofed a bit, but it’s

    make it easy for potential consumers to feel confident that a heat pump will ‘just

    to model the efficiency of my home. I experimented and found that my home heated
    up just fine last winter with radiators set to 50c when it was -2 outside. That
    was the most important test: if you are looking to get a heat pump, lower the
    ‘flow temperature’ of your boiler to, say 45c, and leave it running during a cold
    spell. If your house stays warm, you can probably get a heat pump without a disruptive
    retrofit.'

    moves heat out of the white box where you keep your food and into your kitchen
    – just feel the warm grill at the back. Modern heat pumps can move 4 units of
    heat for every 1 unit of electricity they consume.

    I’ve had the radiators was 42c – most of the time they’re around 35c. This makes
    my heating at least 380% efficient, meaning it is cheaper to run than my old boiler.

    not simple. My installation is a story of foolishness against the odds and definitely
    not the way anyone should have go about getting a heating system. I have an incredibly
    understanding partner, who endured several weeks of very cold evenings with a
    large duvet, stoic expression, and remarkably few complaints. You will be pleased
    to know that we are still together.

    I spoke to were lovely, but when I explained that I was currently without heat,
    they told me it’d be a six week lead time, and that I should just get a boiler,
    which could be installed in two days. Of the three large companies I contacted,
    one never replied, and another said my (out of date) EPC meant a heat pump wouldn’t
    work for me. The one big installer who got back to me had excellent customer service
    and did a full survey of my house the next day.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The survey specified an 11kW heat pump, twice the size I expected. Because it
    was so big, it needed new pipes and radiators, trenching across the garden, approval
    from my electricity network, and the cost would be £13,000\. I’m willing to pay
    a green premium but not £10,000 more than a gas boiler! When I pointed out that
    my calculations had put my heat loss at between 5-6kW, and I thought the system
    could be smaller, they said their software was probably more accurate. Except
    it wasn’t.

    heating demand for decades. With gas this hardly matters. A 30kW combi boiler
    is perhaps £100 more than a 25kW one, so why not oversize? The trouble is, with
    a heat pump, oversizing means upgrading pipes, radiators, and everything else.
    This is disruptive, hugely expensive, [and, critically, unnecessary](https://twitter.com/PeterEastern/status/1682260041619865600).'

    warm if I was a bit less stubborn. She was right.

    boiler and wanted a heat pump but that I was probably a complicated case.'

    [evidence](https://journal-buildingscities.org/articles/10.5334/bc.388) suggests
    that this means much smaller heat pumps can be used than is assumed. Peter ran
    the numbers with my data and this updated evidence, specified a 5.5kW heat pump,
    and had it temporarily installed a few days later. I was warm for the first time
    in weeks.'

    in my story. The boiler market is focused on cheap and quick installation. At
    its worst, the industry pays de-skilled ‘boiler slingers’ (a derisive term) to
    pop a new combi boiler onto the wall, get the heat going fast, and leave you [paying
    over the odds](https://www.theheatinghub.co.uk/articles/turn-down-the-boiler-flow-temperature)
    because the system’s not been set up well. This is bad for heating engineers –
    they’re being turned into a commodity, paid for speed rather than quality, and
    not for the skill involved in good heating design. But it’s now the norm.

    selling overcomplicated, oversized systems to early adopters with time and money
    to spare. That won’t work for most people. My installation is the exception that
    proves the rule: Peter got my heat pump working quickly, to give me heat last
    winter, but had to come back to fine tune the system because the installation
    process is – frankly – still too complicated. This is because the heat pump industry
    has yet to develop smaller, more integrated plug-in replacements for a boiler.
    I doubt that this will work for every property, but it certainly could work for
    most.'

    My EPC D, average sized, Victorian terraced home is warm and cheaper to heat with
    a heat pump than with the boiler it replaced. I swapped two radiators to enable
    it to run more efficiently, but because my installer looked at the data, it needed
    no major new pipework, and because I have set my heat pump to automatically switch
    off during the 4-7pm period of peak electricity demand, two-thirds of the electricity
    it uses is zero carbon. I’ve probably cut the carbon emissions of my home by more
    than three quarters, and also lowered the cost of my heating. My experience should
    be achievable for most people.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But it isn’t, yet. To get cheap, clean heat to be the norm, the heating industry
    needs to modernise. The data that smart meters and cheap sensors can provide make
    it possible to stop oversizing and over specifying heat pumps. It’s easy to foresee
    an integrated energy module with a heat pump, hot water cylinder and battery that
    plugs into existing homes, simplifying installation and providing better value
    to households than today’s combi boilers. This is all doable, with today’s technologies.

    every reason to think that by the time your boiler breaks, you won’t have to think
    twice about switching to one, and that is a cosy note to end the year on.
