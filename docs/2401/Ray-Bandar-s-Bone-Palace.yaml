- en: Ray Bandar collected his first skull in 1953, on Baker Beach in San Francisco.
    He would spend the next sixty years adding to his collection. When Ray died at
    the age of 90 in December 2017 he left a collection of over 7,000 animal skulls,
    most of which were on display on the four floors of his house in San Francisco.

  zh: 雷班达于1953年在旧金山贝克海滩上收集到了他的第一个头骨。接下来的六十年里，他不断增加他的收藏。当雷于2017年12月去世时，享年90岁，他留下了一批超过7000个动物头骨的收藏品，其中大部分陈列在他位于旧金山的四层房子里。

  zh: 1958年，加利福尼亚科学院授予雷荣誉称号“外展副”。他们赞助了他到包括墨西哥和澳大利亚在内的许多国家进行骨头收集的远征。他根据加利福尼亚州发给他与学院合作的科学收集许可证，扩大了他的收藏。
- en: Ray taught biology at Fremont High School in Oakland for 32 years, until he
    retired from teaching in 1990 to dedicate himself full time to bone collecting.
    He was the first person called by Bay Area zoos when an animal died, enabling
    him to add species that including hippopotamuses, tigers, and chimpanzees to his
    collection.

  zh: 雷在奥克兰的弗里蒙特高中教了32年的生物课，直到1990年退休，全职从事骨头收集。当海湾地区的动物死亡时，动物园首先找的就是他，这使他能够将包括河马、老虎和黑猩猩在内的动物添加到他的收藏品中。
- en: Ray's artist wife Alkmene was a vital part of the process. It was Alkmene who
    encouraged the couple to collect a horse skull from the side of the road during
    their cross country honeymoon driving trip in 1954\. She worked with Ray on many
    of his collecting adventures, though she did credit the survival of their marriage
    to her weak sense of smell!

  zh: 雷的艺术家妻子阿尔克米涅是这个过程中不可或缺的一部分。正是阿尔克米涅鼓励他们在1954年的跨国度蜜月自驾游中从路边收集一匹马的头骨。她与雷一起参与了他的许多收集冒险，尽管她将他们的婚姻的生存归功于她的嗅觉迟钝！
- en: We visited Ray's Bone Palace (as he called it) in February of 2018, a few weeks
    before the collection was permanently relocated to the California Academy of Sciences.
    Ray's great nephew Jacob gave us the tour.

    The living room displayed art and a number of skulls, but these merely hinted
    at what was to come.

  zh: 雷把骷髅视为艺术品，雷和他的妻子阿尔克米涅都是热衷于艺术的人。客厅里陈列着艺术品和一些骷髅，但这些只是暗示了即将发生的事情。
- en: As we descended deeper into the house Jacob explained that Ray had won the "grossest
    dead thing" halloween contest so many times that they competition had to forbid
    him from entering to give other contestants a chance. "Puss in Boots", a mummified
    cat wearing boots, was one of the winning entrants.

  zh: 当我们深入房子时，雅各布解释说，雷已经多次赢得了“最恶心的死物”万圣节比赛，以至于他们不得不禁止他参赛，以便给其他选手一个机会。“猫咪穿靴子”，一个戴着靴子的干尸猫，是其中一个获胜者。

    prepare us for Ray's basement.

    rooms. The skulls were accompanied by beautiful hand-written labels (which the
    California Academy of Sciences are determined to keep as part of the collection).

    him if there was anything he hadn't been able to collect himself.
