    uncomfortable about our children’s discomfort: the influence of safetyism can
    be seen in how we approach their emotional lives as well as their corporeal ones.
    Parents worry that [boredom is bad](https://time.com/4419331/boredom-parenting/)
    — when actually, [it is an important learning](https://theconversation.com/how-kids-can-benefit-from-boredom-65596)
    experience. It’s a transitional space in which the child realises that she needs
    to do something differently. She might then try to attract a parent’s attention.
    If she doesn’t get it, she gets fractious; if she is still ignored, she eventually
    finds something else to do. If we leave that novelty-seeking impulse to develop,
    it turns into creativity. It just needs time.'

    in the palms of our hands. Most adults won’t choose the disgruntlement of boredom
    over the abundance of synthetic novelties on offer online — which makes it hard
    to admonish a child for seeking the Xbox or the iPad rather than inventing their
    own forms of entertainment.

    with it. Playing out in the street means muddling along with whoever else is out
    there; it means trying — and often failing — to assert one’s role in an emergent
    group, which might be big, and include kids who are taller and older and cleverer.
    When children play structured games, whether it’s hide and seek or a ball game
    or soldiers fighting in the trenches, they have to abide by the rules of engagement
    — and deal with losing.

    take place for material or real-world gain. The goals exist outside of the goals
    we ordinarily strive for, and they evaporate. Kids need to be emotionally committed
    enough to want to win, but not so invested that they kick off when they don’t.
    At a time when children spend years of their lives being examined and graded in
    school, there’s benefit in both learning to strive and learning to let go.

    sociologist Roger Caillois, who built on Huizinga’s theory, emphasising that play
    isn’t predetermined, but animated by chaos. Hence why play necessarily comes with
    risk. Now, children are far more likely to engage in a sort of pseudo-play, either
    in the form of online games, which are pipelines of reliable and predictable dopamine
    hits, or educational games, which are led by the parent or teacher rather than
    by children themselves, and where the goals are geared towards real-world pedagogical
    gain. Whereas Huizinga argued that play happens outside of ordinary life — and
    is therefore a kind of anarchy — pseudo-play conforms entirely to conventional
    structures, whether it’s the gaming-industrial complex or the lifestyle capitalism
    promoting Important Experiences.

    give kids lessons about biodiversity or engineering or maths may be wholesome,
    even captivating, but they’re anything but self-organising. We see this in the
    adult world of play, too. A festival was once a break from normal social order
    — a temporary, wild otherworld. Now, it’s a luxurious curated experience. Whereas
    play, for Caillois, was “an occasion of pure waste: waste of time, energy, ingenuity,
    skill, and often of money”, now, everything has to be optimised. But what happens
    when we’re not allowed to be wasteful? When all our earliest memories are goal-oriented,
    outcome-focused, organised?'
