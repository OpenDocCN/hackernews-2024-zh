    uncomfortable about our children’s discomfort: the influence of safetyism can
    be seen in how we approach their emotional lives as well as their corporeal ones.
    Parents worry that [boredom is bad](https://time.com/4419331/boredom-parenting/)
    — when actually, [it is an important learning](https://theconversation.com/how-kids-can-benefit-from-boredom-65596)
    experience. It’s a transitional space in which the child realises that she needs
    to do something differently. She might then try to attract a parent’s attention.
    If she doesn’t get it, she gets fractious; if she is still ignored, she eventually
    finds something else to do. If we leave that novelty-seeking impulse to develop,
    it turns into creativity. It just needs time.'

    in the palms of our hands. Most adults won’t choose the disgruntlement of boredom
    over the abundance of synthetic novelties on offer online — which makes it hard
    to admonish a child for seeking the Xbox or the iPad rather than inventing their
    own forms of entertainment.

    with it. Playing out in the street means muddling along with whoever else is out
    there; it means trying — and often failing — to assert one’s role in an emergent
    group, which might be big, and include kids who are taller and older and cleverer.
    When children play structured games, whether it’s hide and seek or a ball game
    or soldiers fighting in the trenches, they have to abide by the rules of engagement
    — and deal with losing.

    take place for material or real-world gain. The goals exist outside of the goals
    we ordinarily strive for, and they evaporate. Kids need to be emotionally committed
    enough to want to win, but not so invested that they kick off when they don’t.
    At a time when children spend years of their lives being examined and graded in
    school, there’s benefit in both learning to strive and learning to let go.

    sociologist Roger Caillois, who built on Huizinga’s theory, emphasising that play
    isn’t predetermined, but animated by chaos. Hence why play necessarily comes with
    risk. Now, children are far more likely to engage in a sort of pseudo-play, either
    in the form of online games, which are pipelines of reliable and predictable dopamine
    hits, or educational games, which are led by the parent or teacher rather than
    by children themselves, and where the goals are geared towards real-world pedagogical
    gain. Whereas Huizinga argued that play happens outside of ordinary life — and
    is therefore a kind of anarchy — pseudo-play conforms entirely to conventional
    structures, whether it’s the gaming-industrial complex or the lifestyle capitalism
    promoting Important Experiences.

  zh: 真正的游戏也教会孩子们如何应对不确定性。这是法国社会学家罗杰·凯罗瓦的观点，他在惠辛加的理论基础上加以发展，强调游戏不是预先确定的，而是由混沌所驱动的。因此，游戏必然充满了风险。如今，孩子们更有可能参与一种伪游戏，要么是在线游戏的形式，这些游戏是可靠和可预测的多巴胺刺激的管道，要么是教育游戏，这些游戏由父母或老师主导而不是由孩子们自己来领导，而目标是朝着真实世界的教育目标而定。而惠辛加认为，游戏发生在普通生活之外——因此是一种无政府状态的伪游戏完全符合常规结构，无论是游戏产业复合体还是推广重要经验的生活方式资本主义。

    give kids lessons about biodiversity or engineering or maths may be wholesome,
    even captivating, but they’re anything but self-organising. We see this in the
    adult world of play, too. A festival was once a break from normal social order
    — a temporary, wild otherworld. Now, it’s a luxurious curated experience. Whereas
    play, for Caillois, was “an occasion of pure waste: waste of time, energy, ingenuity,
    skill, and often of money”, now, everything has to be optimised. But what happens
    when we’re not allowed to be wasteful? When all our earliest memories are goal-oriented,
    outcome-focused, organised?'

  zh: 森林学校和教育玩具以及雅致的木制游戏偷偷地给孩子们关于生物多样性、工程或数学的课程可能是健康的，甚至迷人的，但它们绝不是自我组织的。我们在成人的游戏世界中也可以看到这一点。节日曾经是摆脱正常社会秩序的机会——一个临时的、狂野的异世界。现在，它是一次豪华的策划体验。而对于凯罗瓦来说，游戏是“一次纯粹的浪费：浪费时间、精力、机智、技能，而且通常还有金钱”，现在，一切都要被优化。但当我们不能浪费的时候会发生什么？当我们所有最早的记忆都是目标导向的、以结果为中心的、有组织的时候会发生什么呢？
