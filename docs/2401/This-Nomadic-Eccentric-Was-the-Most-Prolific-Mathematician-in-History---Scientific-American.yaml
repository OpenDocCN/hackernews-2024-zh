    He’s slight, elderly, buzzing from amphetamines, unkempt and uninvited. He shoulders
    past you into your living room, a single suitcase containing all of his worldly
    possessions in tow, and declares, “My brain is open.” You have no idea how long
    he intends to stay because he doesn’t have a house of his own to return to. You’re
    expected to do his laundry and cook his meals because he can’t be bothered to
    learn to take care of himself. In exchange, you’ll receive a sleepless, whirlwind
    encounter, communing with one of the greatest mathematical minds of the 20th century.
    Your involuntary hospitality will probably result in an academic publication with
    your name on it. This was many people’s experience of Paul Erd&odblac;s, the most
    prolific mathematician of all time.

- en: Erd&odblac;s (pronounced “air-duhsh”—the mark on the “&odblac;” is a Hungarian
    double acute accent, not an umlaut) was born in Budapest in 1913 to two high school
    math teachers. He was a pampered prodigy. By age four he could calculate in his
    head how many seconds a person had been alive, and at age 21 he buttered his own
    bread for the first time. That same year he earned his Ph.D. in math. His subsequent
    fellowship position at Princeton University was cut short because, according to
    *The Man Who Loved Only Numbers,* Paul Hoffman’s biography of Erd&odblac;s, his
    colleagues there “found him uncouth and unconventional.” Thus began his nomadic
    life, in which he flitted among brief academic stints, conferences and friends’
    guest rooms. As he would say, “Another roof, another proof.”

    Michael Jacobson of the University of Colorado Denver recounts a story in which
    Erd&odblac;s came to his home, and they worked on math until 1:00 A.M., when Jacobson
    finally succumbed to exhaustion. Erd&odblac;s, who tended to put in 19-hour days,
    stayed up and, at 4:30 A.M., banged pots in the kitchen incessantly to wake up
    his host. Jacobson eventually teetered downstairs in his bathrobe. He described
    the ensuing interaction with his colleague to Hoffman: “What were the first words
    out of his mouth? Not ‘Good morning’ or ‘How’d you sleep?’ but ‘Let n be an integer.’”'

    whopping 1,500-plus academic publications, more than any other mathematician in
    history. Quick aside: some contend that 18th-century mathematician Leonhard Euler
    was the most prolific of all time. Indeed, Euler produced more pages of math,
    whereas Erd&odblac;s produced more papers. So who holds the crown depends on the
    unit of measure, but there is no controversy about these men being the two top
    contenders.'

    probabilistic method. To understand its value, imagine that you’re planning a
    mixer for 100 people, and because mixers work best when some partygoers already
    know one another and some don’t, you want to guarantee that no six guests in any
    grouping are all friends or all strangers. Is that even possible? If you try to
    prevent groups of strangers by inviting many friends, then it becomes harder to
    avoid cliques of friends, yet too many strangers will yield the opposite problem.

- en: Mathematicians often want to prove the existence of a thing with certain properties,
    such as our desired party of 100 people. A natural way to do it would be to give
    an explicit example of such a thing (for instance, come up with a guest list with
    no groups of six mutual friends or strangers). This task may be quite difficult
    in practice, however.

- en: 'Instead Erd&odblac;s pioneered an ingenious alternative. He suggested that
    rather than trying to design the guest list by hand, you should just pick 100
    names (or whatever type of object you’re trying to find) completely at random.
    Then change your question to: What is the probability that my randomly chosen
    object has my desired properties? If you can prove that the probability is anything
    greater than zero, then voilà! Your object must exist; if it didn’t, the probability
    would be zero.'

- en: Changing the question to one about probability often makes it easier to answer.
    That’s in part because you can now apply a rich set of tools from probability
    theory. Interestingly, because the probabilistic method circumvents the need to
    construct your object, you often end up knowing that something exists without
    a clue about what it looks like. Erd&odblac;s cracked many stubborn math problems
    with the probabilistic method, including a more general version of our mixer problem.
    Today the method is considered an essential technique in every researcher’s tool
    kit.

    He had so many collaborators that the field invented the Erd&odblac;s number,
    a measure of authorship distance from Paul Erd&odblac;s, which serves as a badge
    of honor for scholars. Everyone with whom Erd&odblac;s co-authored a paper has
    an Erd&odblac;s number of one, all of their co-authors have a two, and so on.
    You might have heard of the Bacon number, an actor’s co-starring distance from
    Kevin Bacon, but Erd&odblac;s’s recognition as the center of his network predates
    Bacon’s by 25 years.

    have gotten to collaborate with the seller, whose Erd&odblac;s number was four.
    Several people placed substantial bids, but the auction was snagged at the last
    second for $1,031 by a mathematician with no intention of paying up, who called
    the stunt a “mockery” of the system.

    many conjectures he left behind. Sometimes the hardest thing in math is asking
    the right questions, and he had a keen talent for pinpointing important problems.
    He issued personal monetary prizes for solutions to many problems despite having
    little of his own money. What he collected through speaking fees, awards and part-time
    appointments he typically donated to unhoused people, charities and aspiring researchers.
    He once gave $1,000 to a talented high school student struggling to meet tuition
    for Harvard University. Ten years later that student felt ready to pay the money
    back, but Erd&odblac;s instead insisted, “Do with the $1,000 what I did.”

    had children—in fact, he was celibate his entire life. He had very few hobbies,
    didn’t drive, and didn’t have a permanent residence or a steady job. Erd&odblac;s
    died in 1996 at the age of 83 at a math conference in Warsaw. He died doing what
    he loved, largely because he never did anything else.
