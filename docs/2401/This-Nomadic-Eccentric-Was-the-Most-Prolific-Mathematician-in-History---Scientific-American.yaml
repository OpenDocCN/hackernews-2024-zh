    He’s slight, elderly, buzzing from amphetamines, unkempt and uninvited. He shoulders
    past you into your living room, a single suitcase containing all of his worldly
    possessions in tow, and declares, “My brain is open.” You have no idea how long
    he intends to stay because he doesn’t have a house of his own to return to. You’re
    expected to do his laundry and cook his meals because he can’t be bothered to
    learn to take care of himself. In exchange, you’ll receive a sleepless, whirlwind
    encounter, communing with one of the greatest mathematical minds of the 20th century.
    Your involuntary hospitality will probably result in an academic publication with
    your name on it. This was many people’s experience of Paul Erd&odblac;s, the most
    prolific mathematician of all time.

  zh: 门铃响了，你吃惊地发现你的同事站在门口。他非常瘦小，年老，嗑安非他明，并不整洁，也不请自来。他挤过你走进你的客厅，手提一个行李箱，里面装着他所有所有的财产，并宣布：“我的大脑是开放的。”
    你完全不知道他打算待多久因为他自己并没有自己的房子可以回去。你得为他洗衣服，做饭，因为他无法自理。作为交换，你将体验一个无眠的旋风般的相遇，与20世纪最伟大的数学思想家之一共事。你的不情愿款待可能最终会使你名列学术出版物之中。这是许多人对保罗·艾尔迪什的经历，他是史上最多产的数学家。
- en: Erd&odblac;s (pronounced “air-duhsh”—the mark on the “&odblac;” is a Hungarian
    double acute accent, not an umlaut) was born in Budapest in 1913 to two high school
    math teachers. He was a pampered prodigy. By age four he could calculate in his
    head how many seconds a person had been alive, and at age 21 he buttered his own
    bread for the first time. That same year he earned his Ph.D. in math. His subsequent
    fellowship position at Princeton University was cut short because, according to
    *The Man Who Loved Only Numbers,* Paul Hoffman’s biography of Erd&odblac;s, his
    colleagues there “found him uncouth and unconventional.” Thus began his nomadic
    life, in which he flitted among brief academic stints, conferences and friends’
    guest rooms. As he would say, “Another roof, another proof.”

  zh: 艾尔迪什（发音为“air-duhsh”—标在“&odblac;”上的标记是匈牙利的双重重音，不是分离中央语调符）于1913年出生在布达佩斯，他的父母是两名高中数学教师。他是一个被宠坏的神童。4岁时，他就能计算出一个人活了多少秒，并且21岁那年，他第一次为自己涂抹面包。同样的年龄，他获得了数学博士学位。他在普林斯顿大学的后续研究职位因为如霍夫曼的传记《唯有数字的男人》所说，他的同事们“发现他很无礼和不合常规”而夭折。于是他开始了流动的生活，他在短暂的学术工作职位、会议和朋友的客房之间穿梭。正如他自己所说“另一屋顶，另一个证明。”
- en: 'Erd&odblac;s was a notoriously bad house-guest. In Hoffman’s book, mathematician
    Michael Jacobson of the University of Colorado Denver recounts a story in which
    Erd&odblac;s came to his home, and they worked on math until 1:00 A.M., when Jacobson
    finally succumbed to exhaustion. Erd&odblac;s, who tended to put in 19-hour days,
    stayed up and, at 4:30 A.M., banged pots in the kitchen incessantly to wake up
    his host. Jacobson eventually teetered downstairs in his bathrobe. He described
    the ensuing interaction with his colleague to Hoffman: “What were the first words
    out of his mouth? Not ‘Good morning’ or ‘How’d you sleep?’ but ‘Let n be an integer.’”'

    并且不停地在厨房敲锅提醒他的东道主。雅各布森最终穿着睡衣走下楼。他向霍夫曼描述了他与同事的互动： “他第一句话是什么？不是‘早上好’，也不是‘你睡得怎么样？’，而是‘让n为一个整数’。

- en: 'Erd&odblac;s’s single-minded obsession with math led to his authorship of a
    whopping 1,500-plus academic publications, more than any other mathematician in
    history. Quick aside: some contend that 18th-century mathematician Leonhard Euler
    was the most prolific of all time. Indeed, Euler produced more pages of math,
    whereas Erd&odblac;s produced more papers. So who holds the crown depends on the
    unit of measure, but there is no controversy about these men being the two top
    contenders.'

  zh: Erdős 对数学的单-minded 的迷恋导致他发表了超过1500篇学术著作，比历史上任何其他数学家都多。快速一提：一些人认为18世纪数学家Leonhard
    Euler是有史以来最多产的。确实，Euler制作了更多的数学页，而Erdős制作了更多的论文。因此，谁拥有王冠取决于计量单位，但关于这两位数学家是两位最有竞争力的人是毫无争议的。
- en: One of Erd&odblac;s’s most notable contributions was to something called the
    probabilistic method. To understand its value, imagine that you’re planning a
    mixer for 100 people, and because mixers work best when some partygoers already
    know one another and some don’t, you want to guarantee that no six guests in any
    grouping are all friends or all strangers. Is that even possible? If you try to
    prevent groups of strangers by inviting many friends, then it becomes harder to
    avoid cliques of friends, yet too many strangers will yield the opposite problem.

  zh: Erdős 最引人注目的贡献之一是称为概率方法的东西。为了理解它的价值，想象一下你正在计划一个100人的混合器派对，因为混合器在一些派对者已经互相认识而一些不认识的情况下效果最好，你希望保证任何分组中的六个客人都不是朋友或陌生人。这是可能的吗？如果你试图通过邀请许多朋友来防止陌生人的群体，那么避免朋友的小圈子就会变得更难，然而太多陌生人会产生相反的问题。
- en: Mathematicians often want to prove the existence of a thing with certain properties,
    such as our desired party of 100 people. A natural way to do it would be to give
    an explicit example of such a thing (for instance, come up with a guest list with
    no groups of six mutual friends or strangers). This task may be quite difficult
    in practice, however.

  zh: 数学家经常希望证明某些属性的东西的存在，比如我们期望的100人派对。一个自然的做法是给出这样一个东西的明确例子（例如，提出一个没有六个互相认识或陌生人的朋友的群体名单）。然而，在实践中，这个任务可能会很困难。
- en: 'Instead Erd&odblac;s pioneered an ingenious alternative. He suggested that
    rather than trying to design the guest list by hand, you should just pick 100
    names (or whatever type of object you’re trying to find) completely at random.
    Then change your question to: What is the probability that my randomly chosen
    object has my desired properties? If you can prove that the probability is anything
    greater than zero, then voilà! Your object must exist; if it didn’t, the probability
    would be zero.'

  zh: 相反，Erdős 提出了一个巧妙的替代方案。他建议，与其手工设计客人名单，不如随机挑选100个名字（或者你正在尝试找到的任何类型的对象）。然后改变你的问题：我随机选择的对象具有我期望的属性的概率是多少？如果你能证明概率不为零，那么，你的对象必定存在；如果不存在，概率就会是零。
- en: Changing the question to one about probability often makes it easier to answer.
    That’s in part because you can now apply a rich set of tools from probability
    theory. Interestingly, because the probabilistic method circumvents the need to
    construct your object, you often end up knowing that something exists without
    a clue about what it looks like. Erd&odblac;s cracked many stubborn math problems
    with the probabilistic method, including a more general version of our mixer problem.
    Today the method is considered an essential technique in every researcher’s tool
    kit.

    用概率方法解决了许多顽固的数学难题，包括我们混合器问题的更一般版本。今天，这种方法被认为是每位研究人员工具包中的一种必备技术。
- en: Much of Erd&odblac;s’s success sprang from his belief in math as a social activity.
    He had so many collaborators that the field invented the Erd&odblac;s number,
    a measure of authorship distance from Paul Erd&odblac;s, which serves as a badge
    of honor for scholars. Everyone with whom Erd&odblac;s co-authored a paper has
    an Erd&odblac;s number of one, all of their co-authors have a two, and so on.
    You might have heard of the Bacon number, an actor’s co-starring distance from
    Kevin Bacon, but Erd&odblac;s’s recognition as the center of his network predates
    Bacon’s by 25 years.

    the right questions, and he had a keen talent for pinpointing important problems.
    He issued personal monetary prizes for solutions to many problems despite having
    little of his own money. What he collected through speaking fees, awards and part-time
    appointments he typically donated to unhoused people, charities and aspiring researchers.
    He once gave $1,000 to a talented high school student struggling to meet tuition
