- en: The only sure fire way I know to change something, is to start by measuring
    it. That’s true at a personal level for things like a 5k time as well as in a
    professional setting for SMART goals, OKRs or whatever variant is currently in
    fashion. While wanting to measure things is easy, picking what to measure is not.
    You can easily spend months finding the perfect correlation to success but if
    your metrics are changing every quarter, this is almost certainly a waste of time.

  zh: 我唯一确定的改变某事的方法是从测量开始。这对于个人的事情，比如5公里的时间，以及在职业设置中对于SMART目标、OKRs或当前流行的任何变体都是真实的。虽然想要测量事物很容易，但选择要测量的内容却不是那么简单。你可以轻易地花几个月的时间找到与成功的完美相关性，但如果你的指标每个季度都在变化，这几乎肯定是在浪费时间。
- en: There are three general rules of thumb I use to judge a metric. They all come
    down to the lifetime of that metric. Some measures are just fine for a quarter
    but would steer us off track if followed for a year. Conversely some metrics make
    sense when thinking about a ten year plan but are meaningless on a day to day
    scale.

  zh: 我用来评判一个度量标准的三条经验法则。它们都归结为该度量标准的生命周期。有些指标对一个季度来说是完全可以的，但如果用来指导一年的工作，就会使我们偏离轨道。相反，有些指标在考虑十年计划时是有意义的，但在日常规模上毫无意义。
- en: '**How to avoid feeling powerless:** Sometimes there is a really obvious metric.
    Something like ‘Raise our EBITDA to $2M by the end of the calendar year’. At face
    value that is a pretty good metric. It’s precise, well defined and has a timeline.
    If that was an annual goal it’d be ideal. If you’re in a big company however,
    you may have a good portion of the company wondering how on earth they can do
    anything today to make that happen. Typically called lagging metrics, these are
    the outcome, they’re great for targets but not great for in the moment action.
    To correct for them, we need leading indicators.'

- en: '**How to avoid optimising the wrong thing:** Track leading metrics for too
    long and you’ll start to see them lose meaning. Anything you measure runs the
    risk of eventually losing its meaning and becoming a goal in itself. Take the
    sales cold calls objective above, if that becomes the primary incentive for a
    sales team you may start to see meaningless calls being made just to hit a quota.
    In order to avoid your metrics becoming pointless you can try one of two things.
    One, let your metrics expire. Two, pair quantity metrics with quality metrics.'

- en: When you pick leading indicators it’s fine to pick metrics with only a loose

- en: Given these metrics are often loosely correlated and somewhat arbitrary, one
    method to avoid them becoming meaningless is to let them expire. If there is a
    similar, but not identical measure of leading success each quarter it will be
    much harder for anyone to game the numbers.

  zh: 鉴于这些指标通常存在着松散相关和有些任意性，一个避免它们变得毫无意义的方法是让它们过期。如果每个季度都有一个类似但不完全相同的主导成功的指标，任何人都很难操纵数字。

    but not too long to have people over-optimise.

  zh: 如果你选择这条路线，确保两个指标的价值是相等的是很重要的。如果激励措施仍然只与数量对齐，那很容易让质量指标成为一个被忽视的事后补救措施。
- en: '**How to avoid measurement becoming a time sink:** Sometimes it becomes tempting
    to try and find the perfect metric, or to find enough metrics to get perfect visibility
    over every aspect of what you’re trying to optimise. Collecting, collating and
    displaying metrics can be a full time job. It’s important to make sure that work
    doesn’t become a distraction. At the end of the day, the metrics, dashboards and
