- en: The only sure fire way I know to change something, is to start by measuring
    it. That’s true at a personal level for things like a 5k time as well as in a
    professional setting for SMART goals, OKRs or whatever variant is currently in
    fashion. While wanting to measure things is easy, picking what to measure is not.
    You can easily spend months finding the perfect correlation to success but if
    your metrics are changing every quarter, this is almost certainly a waste of time.

- en: There are three general rules of thumb I use to judge a metric. They all come
    down to the lifetime of that metric. Some measures are just fine for a quarter
    but would steer us off track if followed for a year. Conversely some metrics make
    sense when thinking about a ten year plan but are meaningless on a day to day
    scale.

    Something like ‘Raise our EBITDA to $2M by the end of the calendar year’. At face
    value that is a pretty good metric. It’s precise, well defined and has a timeline.
    If that was an annual goal it’d be ideal. If you’re in a big company however,
    you may have a good portion of the company wondering how on earth they can do
    anything today to make that happen. Typically called lagging metrics, these are
    the outcome, they’re great for targets but not great for in the moment action.
    To correct for them, we need leading indicators.'

    calls or follow up meetings. That’s a number that an individual can optimise on
    a daily basis that should help move towards the long term goal.

    waiting for a new paid feature, getting that feature shipped might be close enough
    to track. If that project is huge, the tickets or tasks within it might work too.

- en: OKRs try to get this done with lower objectives feeding into higher ones. That
    can help but only if there is also a shift from lagging to leading as you move
    downwards through objectives.

- en: '**How to avoid optimising the wrong thing:** Track leading metrics for too
    long and you’ll start to see them lose meaning. Anything you measure runs the
    risk of eventually losing its meaning and becoming a goal in itself. Take the
    sales cold calls objective above, if that becomes the primary incentive for a
    sales team you may start to see meaningless calls being made just to hit a quota.
    In order to avoid your metrics becoming pointless you can try one of two things.
    One, let your metrics expire. Two, pair quantity metrics with quality metrics.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When you pick leading indicators it’s fine to pick metrics with only a loose
    correlation. They’re around to be day to day sign posts that things are moving
    in the right direction. As soon as they become more than that they lose their
    value.
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Given these metrics are often loosely correlated and somewhat arbitrary, one
    method to avoid them becoming meaningless is to let them expire. If there is a
    similar, but not identical measure of leading success each quarter it will be
    much harder for anyone to game the numbers.

    It’s a balance of ensuring metrics are around long enough to let people optimise
    but not too long to have people over-optimise.
  prefs:

- en: Pairing metrics means finding a counter balance. For cold calls that might be
    cold-call to meeting conversion rate. The goal here is to ensure that any increase
    in the volume of calls isn’t coming at the expense of the quality.
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you take this route it’s important to make sure both metrics are equally
    valued. It’s easy to have a quality metric that becomes an afterthought if incentives
    are still aligned solely to quantity.

- en: '**How to avoid measurement becoming a time sink:** Sometimes it becomes tempting
    to try and find the perfect metric, or to find enough metrics to get perfect visibility
    over every aspect of what you’re trying to optimise. Collecting, collating and
    displaying metrics can be a full time job. It’s important to make sure that work
    doesn’t become a distraction. At the end of the day, the metrics, dashboards and
    goals you’re setting are signposts for the value, not the value itself.'

    evidence for or against your gut feeling. That comfort is a trap sometimes. Depending
    on your personality that might paint a far too optimistic picture, or one filled
    with signs of failure at every turn.

- en: On the other end of the spectrum is the quest for the one perfect measure. The
    combined, weighted, maybe even AI generated signal that should drive all behaviour.
    Beyond being at major risk of being impossible to influence, it can create an
    endless workload of collecting and cleaning data just to keep the metric up to
    date.
  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Sign posts, as most metrics should be, are there for a quick glance to confirm
    things are moving in the right direction. Or as an early signal to stop and check
    what’s taking things off course.

    topic. There is far more written on this than I could consolidate here. Broadly
    I would suggest the following resources as decent further reading into how to
    pick metrics in a business context. There is likely a whole blog post (or more)
    I could also write about statistics and how to avoid making decisions on random
    noise, but that is for another time.'
