- en: Don’t ring the funeral bells just yet, but the self-checkout kiosk horror show
    could be nearing its end. So far, the grand experiment in robot cashiers is an
    abject failure. Stores across the country are reversing course on the machines,
    and consensus is growing among analysts and insiders that self-checkout has been
    a disaster for consumers and retailers alike, according to a new report in [the
    BBC](https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20240111-it-hasnt-delivered-the-spectacular-failure-of-self-checkout-technology).
    The machines aren’t disappearing anytime soon, but if nothing else, you can expect
    fewer stores to force them on you in the near future.

    or less](https://www.cnn.com/2023/11/18/business/target-self-checkout-new-system/index.html).
    Walmart [pulled the machines out](https://www.businessinsider.com/walmart-pulling-self-checkout-lanes-from-some-stores-2023-9)
    of a number of locations altogether. Booths, a British grocery chain, abandoned
    self-checkout entirely. Dollar General made enormous bets on self checkout tech
    in 2022, but it recently announced the project flopped. On a [December earnings
    call](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2023/12/07/dollar-general-dg-q3-2023-earnings-call-transcript/),
    Dollar General CEO Todd Vasos said the retailer is planning to increase the number
    of employees in stores, particularly in the checkout area, in a major reversal
    of its checkout strategy.

    stores,” Vasos told investors. “We should be using self-checkout as a secondary
    checkout vehicle, not a primary.”

    machines, it can be hard *not* to steal from them. Shoppers are reportedly 21
    times more likely to sneak items past machines than human cashiers, but consumers
    also [constantly steal unintentionally](https://www.businessinsider.com/self-checkout-theft-is-a-bigger-problem-than-retailers-thought-2023-12)
    because the self-checkout process can be so cumbersome. One in five shoppers reported
    that they’ve accidentally stolen items during self-checkout in a survey from [Lending
    Tree](https://www.lendingtree.com/debt-consolidation/self-checkout-survey/). One
    in seven said they’ve stolen from self-checkout on purpose.

  zh: 最大的问题是盗窃。不仅从自助结账机上偷东西容易，而且要不偷都难。据报道，顾客从机器那里偷东西的可能性比从人类收银员那里偷东西高出21倍，但消费者也[经常不经意间偷东西](https://www.businessinsider.com/self-checkout-theft-is-a-bigger-problem-than-retailers-thought-2023-12)，因为自助结账过程可能非常繁琐。根据[Lending
    Tree](https://www.lendingtree.com/debt-consolidation/self-checkout-survey/)的调查，五分之一的顾客报告称他们在自助结账时不小心偷了物品。七分之一的人称他们有意从自助结账处偷东西。
- en: Not only do self-checkout machines double theft rates, they actually increase
    labor costs thanks to employees who get taken away from their other duties to
    help customers deal with the confusing and error prone kiosks. Overall, some analysts
    say the machines increase costs overall, which is especially painful news for
    the industry because they’re so expensive to install. A system of four machines
    can cost [upwards of six figures](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2023/10/self-checkout-kiosks-grocery-retail-stores/675676/).

    because they’ve never seen *Terminator* (wake up sheeple). That’s true even though
    67% said they’ve had self-checkout machines fail. But a growing number of consumers
    are souring on self-checkout, thanks to endless frustrations, [accusations of
