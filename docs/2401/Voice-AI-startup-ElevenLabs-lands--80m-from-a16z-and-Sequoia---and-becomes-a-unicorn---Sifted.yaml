- en: Exactly one year ago, ElevenLabs, a voice AI startup, entered the European generative
    AI scene by launching its text-to-speech technology and [announcing its tiny pre-seed
    round](https://sifted.eu/articles/generative-ai-audio-elevenlabs). Since then,
    it’s been on a wild ride.

    a $19m Series A](https://sifted.eu/articles/elevenlabs-raise-a16z) and today it’s
    announcing another $80m funding in a Series B co-led by Andreessen Horowitz, Nat
    Friedman and Daniel Gross, and joined by Sequoia Capital, among others.

    at $1.1bn (a nice hat tip to the company’s name), becoming a unicorn less than
    two years after launching.

    of the company’s growth has been “much greater than expected”. But his focus remains
    crystal clear: to continue the internal research on audio AI to be able to stay
    ahead of the competition in terms of product quality.'

- en: A year ago, the company started off by launching technology that produces artificial
    voices and clones existing ones. The AI-powered tool can convert text to speech
    in these synthetic voices, featuring lifelike emotion and intonation, allowing
    clients like publishers and content creators to turn written material into audio.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But Staniszewski’s first aim has always been to use AI for dubbing — he grew
    up in Poland where foreign films are often dubbed with one emotionless voice —
    and that’s what the company diverted its efforts into last year.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now its tech also allows for speech-to-speech conversion and dubbing (currently
    available in 29 languages). Last year the company widened the number of languages
    it operates in and expanded into multiple sectors, including entertainment, gaming,
    media and conversational chatbots.

- en: 'As generative AI boomed through 2023, there are many other startups and big
    tech companies that have started to generate AI voices. But Staniszewski says
    that there’s one thing that makes ElevenLabs stand out: its focus.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “One thing which is special for us and that we want to keep is that we focus
    on audio AI… we do our own internal research, our own technology and we build
    products around it. Most of the companies on the market do more of one or more
    of another,” he says.
  prefs: []

    and over big companies, which do their research, but audio is priority number
    seven or 20 for them.”

    of the access to talent and the team of engineers it has built.

    solutions on their tech,” Staniszewski says. “Our big advantage is that we’re

    and building the team.

    it,” Staniszewski says, adding that the company also plans to build specific products
    for some of the verticals it services, such as publishing and filmmaking, and
    strengthen its sales team.

- en: Staniszewski hopes that the investment into research will quickly yield useful
    new features, giving the example of allowing users to control artificial voices’
    emotions, which he says could happen by the end of the year.
  prefs: []

- en: '“Now technology can create audio that can interpret what sort of emotions it
    should use  — you provide it with text or audio [and] the model will interpret
    how it should be read: with a happy emotion, with pauses,”  Staniszewski says.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “What we will see this year or in the upcoming years, is how to control the
    model. The model will predict that something should be read in a happy tone, but
    if you want a sad tone, we imagine that you’ll be able to describe how you want
    audio to be read.”

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The other thing the company is working on, in the slightly longer term, is real-time
    audio translation into all existing languages, delivered with the same voices
    and emotions — this, Staniszewski predicts, might be available in the next three
    to five years.

    on — both in terms of disruption of traditional job markets and when it comes
    to creating dangerous and fraudulent online content.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'That’s why, he says, a part of ElevenLab’s efforts and money will be directed
    at ensuring the safety of its technology. Staniszewski says that the technology
    allows for full traceability — it’s easy to track down who has created a given
    piece of content — and accountability: only people with verified, paid accounts
    will be able to do high-quality voice cloning. The company is also launching a
    tool that will allow anyone on the internet to check if a voice has been created
    by ElevenLabs technology (and soon also by other models).'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'Staniszewski also says that generative AI’s impact on the job market is not
    only negative: it also allows the creation of new use cases for voice usage. For
    example, he says, now that press articles can be converted to audio, ElevenLabs
    wants the voice acting industry to take advantage of the new opportunities — that’s
    why it’s also created a voice marketplace.'

    to create their voice and monetise it,” he says. “They’ll have control over it,
    earn on it and make it available for those new use cases.”
