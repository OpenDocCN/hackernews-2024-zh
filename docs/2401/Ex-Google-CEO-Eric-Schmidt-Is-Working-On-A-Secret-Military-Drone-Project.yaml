    a stealth military drone project, four sources with knowledge of the effort told
    *Forbes*. The project’s existence has not been previously reported and it has
    yet to publicly launch.'

    drones, and will develop unmanned aircraft systems specifically to be used on
    the battlefield, two of the sources said. Three of the sources familiar with Schmidt’s
    engagements said the work is influenced by his recent visits to Ukraine, where
    the billionaire has made inroads with government officials and military leaders
    over the past year. Two of these individuals added that Sebastian Thrun, a cofounder
    of Google’s moonshot lab, is involved with the effort.

    project, when it commenced and whether Schmidt is its sole backer. According to
    two sources, only a handful of people are working on the project, which Schmidt
    has largely managed to keep quiet due to geopolitical sensitivities. It’s unclear
    whether a company has even been incorporated. Schmidt and Thrun declined to comment.'

    “The future of war will be dictated and waged by drones,” [Schmidt wrote](https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-future-of-war-has-come-in-ukraine-drone-swarms-kamikaze-kyiv-31dd19d7

    reported that Schmidt alongside other investors had committed $10 million to Ukrainian
    startup accelerator [D3](https://www.d3.vc/home-en "https://www.d3.vc/home-en"),
    which focuses on military tech but appears to be separate from this new venture.
    D3, which stands for Dare to Defend Democracy, will provide an initial [$125,000

    chairman role at Google in 2017, Schmidt has poured much of his time and wealth
    into bridging the interests of Silicon Valley and the Pentagon through various
    advisory committees, think tanks and his vast startup portfolio. In Washington,
    D.C., he’s advocated for military agencies to accelerate their technology investments,
    particularly around AI, which he believes will play a [key role in national security](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/02/us-not-prepared-to-defend-or-compete-in-ai-era-says-eric-schmidt-group.html

    Innovation Board and commissioner of the National Security Commission on Artificial
    Intelligence, where he made [formal recommendations](https://www.protocol.com/enterprise/eric-schmidt-ai-china

    U.S. and abroad, where he’s leveraged his clout to meet with powerful military
    strategists. Schmidt’s recent personal missions to Ukraine helped to inform his
    new drone project, said three sources familiar with the billionaire’s thinking.
    In particular, two of them said, he was interested in the country’s use of drones
    and quadcopters to launch a counteroffensive against Russia. In September 2022,
    Andriy Yermak, head of the office of President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, [announced](https://www.president.gov.ua/en/news/andrij-yermak-zustrivsya-z-amerikanskim-biznesmenom-u-galuzi-77689
    "https://www.president.gov.ua/en/news/andrij-yermak-zustrivsya-z-amerikanskim-biznesmenom-u-galuzi-77689")

    forces from Ukraine.

    makes sense as a collaborator. A robotics expert from Germany, he forged his first
    ties with Google in 2010, after cofounder Larry Page recruited him to build self-driving
    cars, which Thrun had already been working on at Stanford University. The initiative
    would eventually become Google parent Alphabet’s Waymo subsidiary, and the lab
    morphed into Google X, the tech giant’s skunkworks incubator for moonshot projects.
    In 2010, Thrun also founded the [air-taxi startup Kittyhawk](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2021-09-13/kitty-hawk-founder-sebastian-thrun-to-take-first-air-taxi-trip

    projects have drawn controversy in the past. In 2018, while Schmidt was still
    serving as a technical advisor at Alphabet, thousands of Google employees protested
    its contract for Project Maven, a Defense Department initiative where the military
    used the company’s AI technology to analyze drone surveillance imagery. The dustup
    resulted in employee resignations, the creation of Google’s AI guidelines which
    state that the company won’t develop AI weaponry and its decision not to renew
    the contract.

    with incumbent makers like Northrop Grumman and a host of newer American startups.
    Schmidt may be hoping to capitalize on increasing interest in American-made drones
    from the Pentagon, which [recently announced](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/12/01/pentagon-drones-replicator-ukraine/
    "https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/12/01/pentagon-drones-replicator-ukraine/")

    drone space by tapping U.S. manufacturers to build thousands of craft over the
