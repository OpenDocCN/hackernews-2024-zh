- en: A Linux developer has implemented a couple of changes to a caching algorithm
    which claim to deliver a 6% performance improvement in I/O operations. IO_uring
    creator and self-confessed [Linux](https://www.tomshardware.com/monitors/linux-is-the-only-os-to-support-diagonal-pc-monitor-mode-dev-champions-the-case-for-22-degree-rotation-computing)
    kernel IO dabbler, Jens Axboe, decided to implement the code changes after putting
    them off for years but [admits](https://twitter.com/axboe/status/1747016366891442220)
    the changes were “literally a 5 min job” (h/t [Phoronix](https://www.phoronix.com/news/Linux-Caching-Time-Block-IO)).

    of time queries made to the I/O system. In his [RFC patch notes](https://lore.kernel.org/linux-block/20240115215840.54432-1-axboe@kernel.dk/)
    Axboe writes that lots of code is “quite trigger happy with querying time.” There
    is some code to reduce this already, but the new patchset, described by Axboe
    as trivial, “simply caches the current time in struct blk_plug, on the premise
    that any issue side time querying can get adequate granularity through that.”
    The developer reasons that “Nobody really needs nsec granularity on the timestamp.”
    Here we have another case of some ingenious thinking delivering measurable benefits
    in a long-established piece of technology.

    readings comparing pre-and post-patching. Interestingly the [asynchronous I/O
    interface](https://unixism.net/loti/what_is_io_uring.html) developer hints that
    Linux users might see even greater benefits in the real world. This is because
    in Axboe’s test system he “doesn't even enable most of the costly block layer
    items that you'd typically find in a distro and which would further increase the
    number of issue side time calls.” In other words, those using more bloated Linux
    vendor kernels could get more mileage out of Axboe’s new patches.

    with Linux 6.9, later this year. Whenever it arrives, it is great to get extra
    performance for free, especially as storage can be a common system bottleneck.
    Meanwhile, if you are in the market for faster or more capacious storage, it might
    be a good idea to check out our [best SSD storage](https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/best-ssds,3891.html)
