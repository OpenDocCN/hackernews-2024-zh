    will be a charge of $0.005 per IP per hour for all public IPv4 addresses, whether
    attached to a service or not. That''s a total of $43.80 per year, a pretty hefty
    number! The reason for this is outlined in the [AWS announcement](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-aws-public-ipv4-address-charge-public-ip-insights/):'

    cost to acquire a single public IPv4 address has risen more than 300% over the
    past 5 years. This change reflects our own costs and is also intended to encourage
    you to be a bit more frugal with your use of public IPv4 addresses.

    unnecessary public IPv4 addresses using Border0\. But before we go there, let's
    look at how many IPv4 addresses Amazon has, how much that's worth, and how much
    AWS will make with this new charge to your monthly bill.

    of AWS requires a massive amount of IP addresses. And so it comes as no surprise
    that over the years, Amazon has spent a lot of money acquiring an enormous number
    of IPv4 ¬†addresses. All so we can continue to spin up our ec2 instances, load
    balancers, and NAT gateways without worrying about IPv4 addresses.

    monetary value and can be bought and sold. In fact, the price of IPv4 addresses
    has increased significantly over the last decade, and would have made an excellent
    investment if you got in early!

    how much AWS will make from the new IPv4 charge. For that, we need the price per
    IP and the number of IPv4 addresses in use by AWS customers.

    address. The second variable, the number of IPv4 addresses in use by AWS customers,
    is harder to determine. However, we can make some educated guesses for fun!

    at any given time by AWS customers. Let's explore a few scenarios, starting with
    a very conservative estimate, say 10% of the IPv4 addresses published in the [AWS
    JSON](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/aws-ip-ranges.html) (79M
    IPv4 addresses) are used for a year. That's 7.9 Million IPv4 addresses x $43.80,
    almost $346 Million a year. At 25% usage, that's nearly $865 Million a year. And
    at 30% usage, that's a billion dollars!

    approach is to try and measure it. How many IP addresses are alive within the
    AWS network right now? AWS conveniently publishes all addresses, so we could send
    an ICMP echo request (a ping) to all of them and measure how many send back an
    echo reply.

    that downloads the JSON with all the AWS IP addresses and filters out the categories
    "AMAZON," "EC2," and "GLOBAL ACCELERATOR." We're going to assume these are all
    the customer-used (charged) IP addresses. I.e., we're not going to ping services
    like Route53 Health Checks or Cloudfront as those won‚Äôt show up on your bill as
    an IPv4 charge.

    the replies. With this, we have some actual measurement data, and we observe that
    we received a reply from roughly 6 Million IPv4 addresses.

- en: That‚Äôs another good data point. However, remember that many ec2 instances and
    other services will have strict security groups and, by default, won't respond
    to a ping packet. So, it's fair to say that six million active IPs is the absolute
    minimum. The actual number of active IPv4 addresses could easily be double that
    given the various default security groups blocking ICMP.

    between $400 Million and $1 Billion dollars a year with this new IPv4 charge!***
    That's a nice bump for AWS, especially given that this was provided for free until
    today.

- en: Your AWS services, such as ec2 instances, may have public IPv4 addresses for
    a variety of reasons. One common reason is to have management access to your servers.
    For example, using SSH or RDP. Or to access the app running on your machine, like
    a database or HTTP application.
