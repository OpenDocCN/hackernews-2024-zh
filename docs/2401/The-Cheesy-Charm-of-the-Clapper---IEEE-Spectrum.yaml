    jingle touted a gadget to turn your lights, your TV, or any other electrical device
    on or off with the clap of your hands. If you watched any amount of American television
    back then, you probably saw the Clapper’s repetitious and yet oddly endearing
    ad, and perhaps you, like many others, felt compelled to give it a try.

- en: The Clapper’s ad was the brainchild of Joe Pedott, a master of marketing who
    made people want gizmos they never imagined they needed—the [Garden Weasel](https://www.gardenweasel.com/groundbreakingtips/about-us/company-history/),
    the [Ove Glove](https://oveglove.com/), the [Chia Pet](https://www.chia.com/about/).
    In 1985, he was hired to sell the Great American Turn-On, the Clapper’s original
    name. The only problem? The device did not work. Indeed, when people used it to
    control their TVs, it tended to short-circuit the set.

  zh: Clapper广告的创意来自于Joe Pedott，一位精通营销的大师，他让人们渴望他们从未想象过需要的小工具——[花园燕子](https://www.gardenweasel.com/groundbreakingtips/about-us/company-history/)，[Ove手套](https://oveglove.com/)，[Chia宠物](https://www.chia.com/about/)。
    1985年，他受聘销售美国伟大的Clapper的原始名称Great American Turn-On。唯一的问题是？这个设备不起作用。事实上，当人们用它来控制他们的电视时，它往往会使电视机短路。
- en: Still, Pedott liked the idea of the gadget, and after the original investors
    went bankrupt, he bought the patent and hired engineers to fix the glitches. And
    so the Clapper was born.

- en: Before I get into what made the Clapper so appealing, let’s first consider its
    predecessor. Despite its name, the Great American Turn-On was invented in Canada.
    In 1985, Peter Liljequist and Kou Chen filed a [Canadian patent](https://patents.google.com/patent/CA1250654A/en)
    for an acoustic switch for turning lights and other appliances on and off. Then
    they approached Pedott to help market a gadget based on the switch.

  zh: 在我介绍Clapper如何吸引人之前，让我们先考虑它的前身。尽管名为Great American Turn-On，但它是在加拿大发明的。1985年，Peter
    Liljequist和Kou Chen为用于打开和关闭灯和其他家用电器的声学开关申请了[加拿大专利](https://patents.google.com/patent/CA1250654A/en)，然后他们找到Pedott帮助市场一款基于该开关的小工具。
- en: Pedott test-marketed the Great American Turn-On at People’s Drug in Washington,
    D.C. While he was delighted that it sold well, the gadget itself failed catastrophically.
    Pedott also discovered that the company behind it was a sham, at least according
    to his [oral history](https://www.si.edu/media/NMAH/NMAH-AC0898_pedott_2004.pdf)

- en: After Pedott acquired the patent, which was assigned to his company, Joseph
    Enterprises, he hired Carlile Stevens and Dale Reamer to get the device to work.
    Eventually, they filed for a U.S. patent for the new and improved device. Stevens,
    a physicist, was a prolific inventor with more than 30 patents to his name. In
    the 1990s, he became known for his long-running [legal battle](https://www.nytimes.com/1997/07/21/business/two-inventors-hope-they-will-finally-win-compensation-for-device-that-was.html)
    against Universal Manufacturing Corp. for suppression of his patent for fluorescent
    light ballasts; he and his coinventor eventually won a jury award of [US $96 million](https://www.nytimes.com/1997/09/01/business/award-to-lighting-inventor-upheld-on-appeal.html).

    No. 5,493,618](https://patents.google.com/patent/US5493618A/)) is a chatty marvel.
    “In today’s society convenience is almost a necessity,” it states. “Many people
    will elect not to use an electrical appliance such as a television or light, if
    they must walk across a room to turn the television or light ON.”

    “许多人会选择不使用电器，比如电视或灯，如果他们必须走过房间去打开电视或灯。”
- en: To accommodate our essential laziness, manufacturers invented remote controls,
    only to be confronted by our ability to immediately lose them. “The requirement
    of possession [of the remote] in itself can be a major inconvenience,” the patent
    continues. “Often a person must walk across a room to retrieve the remote control
    unit, and frequently it may be misplaced, which, at best, requires extra time
    and effort to find.” Obviously, we needed an intervention. Hence the Clapper’s
    appeal.

    显然，我们需要一种干预。因此 Clapper 受到了人们的青睐。
- en: The Clapper plugged into a normal, American-style two-prong wall socket and
    had two outlets, to plug in two different appliances—a lamp and a TV, say. Each
    appliance was controlled by its own series of claps. The Clapper also had an “away”
    setting that was activated by noise, designed to deter burglars while homeowners
    were on vacation.

- en: 'The electronics were quite simple: a microphone to pick up sound in the room,
    a bandpass filter in the range of 2,200 to 2,800 hertz (the typical range of a

    ROM 源代码。
- en: The Clapper still had some problems. Some users clapped too slowly, others too
    softly. Sometimes there was too much background noise to distinguish a clap, other
    times the Clapper responded to an incidental noise that was not a clap. One dissatisfied

- en: Yet, thanks to Pedott’s catchy jingle and ubiquitous low-budget commercials,
    the Clapper became ingrained in America’s kitsch culture, whether bought with
    purpose or as a novelty gift. Still sold today, the Clapper now comes in many

    11, he contracted rheumatic fever and was bedridden for more than a year. His

    as an ad man. He did well, and then he did really well, when he discovered the
    terra-cotta ram that became [the first Chia Pet](https://www.chia.com/about/).
    As with the Clapper, Pedott didn’t invent the Chia Pet, a clay figurine that would
    sprout a green coat of chia plants. The figurines weren’t turning a profit, but
    Pedott recognized the potential and bought the rights. Then he examined the supply
    line, cut out the middleman, wrote a catchy jingle, and turned the Chia Pet into
    a household name.
