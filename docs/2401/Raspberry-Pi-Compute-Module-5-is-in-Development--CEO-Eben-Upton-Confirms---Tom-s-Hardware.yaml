- en: Raspberry Pi YouTuber [Jeff Geerling](https://youtu.be/Lky4FSfbc1E) had the
    chance to interview Raspberry Pi CEO Eben Upton at [CES](https://www.tomshardware.com/tag/ces).
    During the interview we hear Upton confirming that Raspberry Pi 5 production is
    ramping up, and inadvertently we also get first confirmation that the Raspberry
    Pi Compute Module 5 is an upcoming product.

    5 and Upton replies "Yeah. No, it's happening. I think we've committed CM5 (Compute
    Module 5) is happening".

- en: Geerling then talks about a [forum post](https://forums.raspberrypi.com/viewtopic.php?t=358183#p2147972)
    from a Raspberry Pi engineer which alludes to a possible release date of the first
    half of 2024\. Upton's unintentionally enigmatic response does not confirm when
    we will see a CM5\. All we get is a simple "Yeah" followed by highlighting that
    Raspberry Pi has [released guidance](https://pip.raspberrypi.com/categories/944-raspberry-pi-compute-module-5)
    for those wishing to design products based around the future board. The guidance
    is not for general distribution, requiring a lengthy sign-up and verification
    process in order to use the guide.

- en: What we can confirm though is that the Compute Module 5 will share the same
    dual connectors as the [Compute Module 4](https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/raspberry-pi-compute-module-4).
    Previous Compute Modules used a SODIMM interface for power and data. With the
    CM4 we saw dual edge connectors introduced. One of which served power and low-speed
    interfaces, the other for higher-speed interfaces.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Retaining the dual connector should mean that boards designed around the CM4
    should work with the CM5\. The assumption being that the 55 x 40 MM form factor
    remains the same.

- en: The forward guidance documentation will help to ensure that third-party CM4
    boards will have the best chance of compatibility with the Compute Module 5.

    also introduced a plethora of configuration options. With modules ranging in RAM
    from 1 to 8GB, flash storage from 8 to 32GB and modules with Wi-Fi and Bluetooth.

    options. On release we have 4 and 8GB models on offer, with 1 and 2GB to come
    in the near future. Logically, the Compute Module 5 should also provide the same
    RAM, flash storage and Wi-Fi options.

- en: The Compute Module 4, just like the [Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W](https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/raspberry-pi-zero-2-w-review),
    hasn't had the best chance of success. Released in late 2022, the Compute Module
    4 packs the power of the Raspberry Pi 4 into a smaller form factor. That was great
    news for all of us eager to pack more power into a project, but it was also released
    at the tail-end of a pandemic and in the midst of a global chip shortage. For
    a time, the CM4 and the Zero 2 W were virtually unobtainable. Happily they are
    now in a more plentiful supply.

- en: Does the impending CM5 mean that the CM4 is dead and buried? Far from it. According
    to Raspberry Pi's CM4 Product Brief [[PDF]](https://datasheets.raspberrypi.com/cm4/cm4-product-brief.pdf),
    the board will be in production until 2031\. Don't worry, the Raspberry Pi Zero
    2 W will also remain in production until January 2028 [[PDF]](https://datasheets.raspberrypi.com/rpizero2/raspberry-pi-zero-2-w-product-brief.pdf).

    speculate that the Compute Module 5 will be with us within a year. But we can
    confirm that once they are available, there will be a full review on Tom's Hardware.
