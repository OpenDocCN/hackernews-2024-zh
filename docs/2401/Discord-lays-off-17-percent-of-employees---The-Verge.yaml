    of Discord’s workforce by 17%. This means we are saying goodbye to 170 of our
    talented colleagues. This is a decision we did not take lightly, but it is one
    that we have conviction in to better serve our users, our business and our mission
    over the long term.

    the millions of people who turn to Discord every day to spend time with their
    friends.

    our workforce even faster, increasing by 5x since 2020\. As a result, we took
    on more projects and became less efficientin how we operated.

    the way we work together to bring moreagilityto our organization. This is what
    largely drove the decision to reduce the size of our workforce. While difficult, I
    am confident this will put us in the best position to continue building a strong
    and profitable business that delivers amazing products for our users and supports
    our mission for years to come.
