- en: A friend recently complained about how many people lack the basic skill of believing
    arguments. That is, if you have a valid argument for something, then you should
    accept the conclusion. Even if the conclusion is unpopular, or inconvenient, or
    you don’t like it. He envisioned an art of rationality that would make people
    believe something *after it had been proven to them*.

    demolish their position and make them look like an idiot. Reduce them to some
    form of “Look, everything you say fits together and I can’t explain why you’re

- en: And there are people who can argue circles around me. Maybe not on *every* topic,
    but on topics where they are experts and have spent their whole lives honing their
    arguments. When I was young I used to read pseudohistory books; Immanuel Velikovsky’s
    [Ages in Chaos](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ages_in_Chaos) is a good example
    of the best this genre has to offer. I read it and it seemed so obviously correct,
    so perfect, that I could barely bring myself to bother to search out rebuttals.

- en: And so on for several more iterations, until the labyrinth of doubt seemed inescapable.
    What finally broke me out wasn’t so much the lucidity of the consensus view so
    much as starting to sample different crackpots. Some were almost as bright and
    rhetorically gifted as Velikovsky, all presented insurmountable evidence for their
    theories, and all had mutually exclusive ideas. After all, Noah’s Flood couldn’t
    have been a cultural memory both of the fall of Atlantis *and* of a change in
    the Earth’s orbit, let alone of a lost Ice Age civilization or of megatsunamis
    from a meteor strike. So given that at least some of those arguments are wrong
    and all seemed practically proven, I am obviously just gullible in the field of
    ancient history. Given a total lack of independent intellectual steering power
    and no desire to spend thirty years building an independent knowledge base of
    Near Eastern history, I choose to just accept the ideas of the prestigious people
    with professorships in Archaeology, rather than those of the universally reviled
    crackpots who write books about [Venus being a comet](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worlds_in_Collision).

  zh: 直到怀疑的迷宫似乎无法摆脱为止。最终让我挣脱出来的并不是共识观点的明晰，而是开始尝试不同的怪人。有些人几乎和维利科夫斯基一样聪明且有修辞天赋，都为他们的理论提出了无法逾越的证据，而且所有人都有互相排斥的想法。毕竟，挪亚的洪水不可能既是亚特兰蒂斯沉没的文化记忆，*又*是地球轨道的变化，更别提一个失落的冰河时代文明或来自流星撞击的巨型海啸了。所以，考虑到至少有些论点是错误的，而且所有论点似乎都被实际证明了，显然我在古代历史领域是轻信的。鉴于我完全缺乏独立的智力引导能力，也没有渴望花三十年时间建立近东历史的独立知识基础，我选择只接受那些有考古学教授头衔的杰出人士的想法，而不是那些被普遍鄙视的关于[Venus
    being a comet](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worlds_in_Collision)的怪人们写的书。
- en: You could consider this a form of epistemic learned helplessness, where I know
    any attempt to evaluate the arguments is just going to be a bad idea so I don’t
    even try. If you have a good argument that the Early Bronze Age worked completely
    differently from the way mainstream historians believe, I just don’t want to hear
    about it. If you insist on telling me anyway, I will nod, say that your argument
    makes complete sense, and then totally refuse to change my mind or admit even
