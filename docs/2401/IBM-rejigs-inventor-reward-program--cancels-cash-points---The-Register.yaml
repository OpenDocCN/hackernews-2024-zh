- en: Exclusive IBM has rejigged a program that rewarded inventors at Big Blue for
    patents or publications, leaving some angry that they are missing out on potential
    bonuses.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: By scrapping and replacing the scheme, a source told *The Register*, IBM has
    eliminated a financial liability by voiding the accrued, unredeemed credits issued
    to program participants that could have been converted into potential cash awards.

- en: For years, IBM has sponsored an "Invention Achievement Award Plan" to incentivize
    employee innovation. In exchange for filing patents, or for publishing articles
    that served as defense against rival patents, IBM staff were awarded points that
    led to recognition and potentially cash bonuses.

- en: According to documentation seen by *The Register*, "Invention points are awarded
    to all inventors listed on a successful disclosure submission."

- en: One point was awarded for publishing. Three points were awarded for filing a
    patent or four if the filing was deemed high value. For accruing 12 points, program
    participants would get a payout.

    \ achieve – which must include at least one file decision,\" the rules state.\
    \ And for each plateau achieved, IBM would pay its inventors $1,200 in recognition\
    \ of their efforts."

- en: No longer, it seems. IBM canceled the program at the end of 2023 and replaced
    it with a new one that uses a different, incompatible point system called BluePoints.

- en: '"The previous Invention Achievement Award Plan will be sunset at midnight (eastern
    time) on December 31st, 2023," company FAQs explain. "Since Plateau awards are
    one of the items being sunset, plateau levels must be obtained on or before December
    31, 2023 to be eligible for the award. Any existing plateau points that have not
    been applied will not be converted to BluePoints."'

    employees just didn't have time between the announcement and the program sunset
    to pursue the next plateau and cash out.

    grab. And they sought answers from corporate brass through an internal Slack channel.

    unilaterally cancel the payment schedule after work has been delivered?"

    The invention award program was buggered a long time ago. It rewarded words on
    a page instead of true innovation. [Former CEO Ginni Rometty] made it worse by
    advocating the program to fluff up young egos." ®'

    is now taking "a 'quality over quantity' approach" with regards to proposed inventions.
