- en: In a landmark study, researchers have mapped the psychological landscape that
    shapes our susceptibility to conspiracy theories. Analyzing data from 170 studies,
    they’ve found that beliefs in conspiracy theories are not only influenced by personality
    traits but also by deeper motivational needs, such as the desire for certainty
    or feeling misunderstood by society. The findings have been published in the scientific
    journal [*Psychological Bulletin*](https://psycnet.apa.org/fulltext/2023-79252-001.html).

- en: Conspiracy theories are a fascinating and complex facet of human culture, often
    defined as beliefs or explanations that attribute the cause of significant events
    or situations to secret, malevolent plots orchestrated by powerful and covert
    groups. Conspiracy theories usually thrive on the lack of definitive evidence,
    relying instead on suggestive, ambiguous, or circumstantial details.

    offering alternative explanations that challenge official accounts or mainstream
    understanding. While some conspiracy theories might occasionally turn out to have
    a basis in reality, most are widely considered implausible and unsupported by
    empirical evidence, yet they continue to capture the imagination and belief of
    certain segments of the population.

    understanding the psychology behind these beliefs has become more crucial than
    ever. Previous studies have explored various aspects of this phenomenon, looking
    at how personality traits, motivational factors, and social influences contribute
    to the belief in conspiracy theories.

- en: Yet, despite a wealth of research, there was still a lack of comprehensive understanding
    of how these different factors interplay. This gap in knowledge led researchers
    to conduct one of the most extensive studies to date, aiming to integrate these
    diverse strands of research into a cohesive picture.

    belief system that is difficult to change. Conspiracy belief can be highly consequential,
    so it is important to identify ways to intervene on conspiracy belief,” explained
    [Shauna Bowes](https://shaunambowes.wixsite.com/website), a postdoctoral researcher
    at Vanderbilt University and the lead author of the new research.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The researchers conducted a meta-analysis, a powerful statistical technique
    that combines data from multiple individual studies to extract broader insights
    and trends. This method is particularly useful in fields like psychology, where
    research findings can be diverse and sometimes contradictory.

    which included sifting through a vast array of sources such as peer-reviewed journal
    articles, dissertations, theses, and unpublished data. This search was conducted
    using electronic databases like Google Scholar and APA PsycInfo. They employed
    specific Boolean search phrases to ensure a comprehensive collection of relevant
    studies. Their analysis included 170 studies, 257 samples, and 1,429 effect sizes,
    involving a total of 158,473 participants.

    from the eligible studies. These variables were carefully categorized into broader
    domains such as motivational (epistemic, existential, social) and personological
    (psychopathology, general/normal-range personality) domains, based on existing
    frameworks in the field.

    with the tendency to believe in conspiracy theories. “I was surprised by the fact
    that about 90% of the variables assessed significantly predicted conspiracy belief
    (of 52 variables). These results point to conspiracy belief being even more psychologically
    complex than I initially presumed,” Bowes told PsyPost.

    ideation. This model posits that conspiratorial thinking is driven by three key
    needs: understanding one’s environment (epistemic), feeling secure and safe (existential),
    and maintaining a superior image of oneself and one’s ingroup (social).'

    who exhibited lower levels of analytical thinking and cognitive reflection were
    more inclined to endorse conspiracy theories. This relationship suggests that
    a less critical approach to information processing might predispose individuals
    to accept unverified or speculative ideas.

- en: Additionally, existential motives played a substantial role. The belief in conspiracy
    theories was strongly related to feelings of powerlessness, existential threats,
    and a general sense of cynicism towards the world. These findings highlight that
    individuals who perceive the world as a more threatening and uncontrollable place
    are more susceptible to conspiratorial thinking. This connection could be understood
    as a psychological response to uncertainty and a chaotic environment, where conspiracy
    theories provide a sense of understanding and control.

- en: The study also shed light on the role of social factors in conspiratorial ideation.
    Feelings of alienation and low self-esteem were linked to a higher likelihood
    of endorsing conspiracy theories. Additionally, a perception of outgroups as threatening
    and negative was strongly related to conspiratorial beliefs. These findings suggest
    that how individuals perceive their relationship with society and their social
    environment can influence their susceptibility to conspiracy theories.

    traits, distinguishing between abnormal-range and normal-range traits. It found
    that conspiratorial ideation is strongly related to abnormal-range traits, such
    as schizotypy, paranoia, tendencies to have unusual experiences, trait psychoticism,
    and hostility. These traits are associated with impaired functioning and a negative
    perception of others and events.

    model) showed very small correlations with conspiratorial ideation. This indicates
    that while these general traits have some influence, they are not as pivotal in
    predicting belief in conspiracy theories as abnormal-range traits.

    intellectual humility were significant, negative correlates of conspiratorial
    ideation, particularly when measuring honesty–humility and comprehensive features
    of intellectual humility. This suggests that a lack of humility is a notable marker
    of conspiratorial thinking.

    with psychopathology and certain personality disorders than with general personality
    functioning.

    factors that predict conspiracy belief, but not all are equally strong predictors,”
    Bowes told PsyPost. “Three domains were the strongest predictors of conspiracy
    belief: tendencies to have odd beliefs and experiences, perceive threat and danger,
    and be antagonistic or feel that you are superior to others. These three domains
    included the strongest correlates of conspiracy belief, spanning existential,
    epistemic, and social motivations and needs.”'

    included was conducted in English-speaking, Western countries, raising questions
    about the applicability of the findings across different cultural contexts. Another
    significant limitation is the cross-sectional nature of the data, which hinders
    the ability to determine causality or the temporal order of the relationships
    observed.

    correlates actually cause conspiracy belief,” Bowes explained. “Longitudinal,
    experimental, and developmental work is needed to address causes of conspiracy
    belief. The two strongest correlates of conspiracy belief fell under the domain
    of threat and danger, with social threat perception being the strongest positive
    predictor and trust being the strongest negative predictor. I think these variables
    will be particularly important to consider in future research.”
