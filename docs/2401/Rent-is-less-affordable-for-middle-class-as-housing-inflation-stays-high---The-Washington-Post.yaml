- en: Half of American renters spend more than 30 percent of their income on housing
    costs — a key benchmark for affordability — with the financial strain rising the
    fastest for middle-class tenants. That’s according to a new report from the Harvard
    Joint Center for Housing Studies, which found that the number of such renters,
    considered to be “cost-burdened,” hit a record 22.4 million in 2022 — up 2 million
    from just three years before. And of those households, 12.1 million had housing
    costs that ate up more than 50 percent of their income, an all-time high for those
    with “severe burdens.”
