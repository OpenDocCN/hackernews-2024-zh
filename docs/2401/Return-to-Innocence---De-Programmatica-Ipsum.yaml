- en: The pages of this magazine have often orbited around the subject of retrocomputing.
    Take, for example, the editions about [sustainability](/the-twenty-year-computer/),
    [computer museums](/the-digital-dark-ages/), [hardware](/the-untimely-demise-of-workstations/),
    [hobbies](/zx2020/), [gaming](/insert-coin/), [operating systems](/ken-ross-paul-laughton/),
    or the one about [BASIC](/programming-the-liberal-arts/) published last summer.
    If you pay attention, you most probably have realized how much retrocomputing
    has grown in popularity in the past few decades, with more and more people learning
    on YouTube or TikTok how to replace the batteries or leaking capacitors from the
    motherboards of all kinds of computers of yesteryear.

    trends hidden beneath the appeal of retrocomputing in hobbyists and computer clubs.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'First trend: Moore’s Law, or rather, its lack thereof. Despite all the efforts
    of [Apple](/eternally-finally/) to hide its flattening curve with ARM-based chips,
    it is *vox populi* that a computer from 2014 is just about as powerful as the
    one you bought as a Christmas gift in 2023, bar the amount of RAM or the speed
    and capacity of the SSDs therein. On the other hand, consumer PCs of 2014 were,
    by all standards, widely superior to those of 2004, and immensely more than those
    of 1994 and, needless to say, 1984.'

    transitional age, where you are as a matter of fact retrocomputing as you read
    this article. Spoiler alert: unless there happens to be some breakthrough in physics
    that will drive more gigahertz to our CPUs, more crypto to those GPUs, more watts
    to our batteries, and more money to cloud providers, or unless there is some development
    in the realm of affordable, “home” quantum computing (will that ever be a thing?)
    we most probably will not see any difference between the computer you are using
    today and the one you will receive as a gift in Christmas 2033\. Get used to this
    fact.'

    also as one with widely applicable skills, particularly for those working in sustainable
    computing, and those spreading its use in regions of the world where it has not
    yet reached peak maturity, and where refurbishing old hardware is an effective
    way to raise standards of living through computer technology. In this age of rising
    temperatures and rising oceans, reusing old computers is a very valuable skill.

    brought by ChatGPT and other copilots shifted the spotlight back to retrocomputing.
    Paraphrasing [Obi-Wan Kenobi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obi-Wan_Kenobi), computers
    of yore were “elegant weapons for a more civilized age.” And just like Jedis finish
    their training by building their own lightsabers, many computer enthusiasts scavenge
    old computer stores for the [Kyber crystals](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Kyber_crystal)–sorry,
    for the vintage CPUs and capacitors required to build or repair their own retrocomputer
    systems.'

    vastly overpowered by the cheapest Apple Watch, yet it helped Armstrong and Aldrin
    to land on the Moon. Those of us old enough to have witnessed a Commodore 64 in
    action, chuckle as we run a [VICE emulator](https://vice-emu.sourceforge.io/)
    and load a copy of [Impossible Mission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impossible_Mission).
    We remind ourselves of times when Turbo Pascal was the most advanced IDE, and
    how we used it to code 2D games with our friends, tirelessly copying code from
    a magazine. We shake our heads in dismay watching young kids trying to use Windows
    95, struggling just like Scotty did [in Star Trek IV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpWhugUmV5U)
    as he interacted (“how quaint!”) with a first-generation Mac… using the mouse
    as a microphone.

    And thankfully so. In our world, there is no better mechanism to get away from
    the Generative AI craze than by using a computer that cannot run any of that.
    Preferably, not even a web browser. How is that for a Luddite? As much as we can
    find ChatGPT or DALL-E dazzling inceptions, we marvel at a time when computers
    were so simple that you could understand each circuit on it just by reading the
    pile of manuals provided by the constructor in the box–yet another sign that these
    were more elegant weapons for a more civilized age.

    or read [history books](/william-aspray/). This is why we browse old photos in
    an album left behind by our grandparents. People have done this for ages, but
    the difference nowadays is that, for the first time in the history of mankind,
    a fifty-year-old person can have vivid memories of a childhood before the iPhone
    existed. The outstanding level of change (or, as historians like to put it, the
    “pace of progress”) of our current times is draining our capacity for attention
    and patience.
