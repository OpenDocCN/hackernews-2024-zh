    global liquidity provider focusing on using sophisticated quantitative analysis
    and a deep understanding of market mechanics to help keep prices consistent and
    reliable.

    a statically typed functional language, as our primary development platform. Jane
    Street’s technology group is small by design, which means we need to maximize
    the productivity of each person we hire. We believe functional programming helps
    us do that. But it’s not about productivity alone: programming in a rich and expressive
    language like OCaml is just more fun. At Jane Street, functional programming isn’t
    a tool we reserve for some special set of problems. From systems automation to
    trading systems, from monitoring tools to research code, we write everything that
    we can in OCaml.'

    around their choices of technology and research, and even have a “Jane Street’s
    puzzles page” on their website where they publish a new puzzle every once in a
    while.

    skill in Figgie is in negotiating trades that benefit both the buyer and seller.
    Like in poker, your objective in Figgie is to make money over a series of hands.

    the website also has a place where you can play against live and bot players based
    in the Americas, Europe, and Asia.
