- en: The subtitle of David Edmonds’s biography of the English philosopher Derek Parfit
    (1942-2017) is liable to raise more than a few eyebrows. Surely a mission to save
    morality is something only a God-like being could take on. And since God is dead,
    or rather has ceased to be believable, the prospect of rescuing morality must
    have vanished too. So is the subtitle to suggest that Parfit really was blessed
    with superhuman powers? Or are we to read it ironically, perhaps as a satirical
    comment on one philosopher’s exaggerated view of his own importance?

  zh: 大卫·埃德蒙兹（David Edmonds）对英国哲学家德里克·帕菲特（1942-2017）的传记的副标题可能会引起不少人的疑虑。拯救道德的使命似乎只有神一样的存在才能承担。而且，由于上帝已经死了，或者说不再可信，拯救道德的前景也必定消失了。那么，副标题是否暗示帕菲特真的被赋予了超凡的力量呢？或者我们应该讽刺地理解它，或许是对一个哲学家对自己重要性的夸大看法的讽刺性评论？
- en: 'The book’s first page leaves the reader in no doubt that the protagonist’s
    own view of what he was doing was seriously intended. Edmonds opens with an episode
    when Parfit, in his later years, found himself hospitalised following a sudden
    failure of his lungs. Observing the steady stream of visitors entering the patient’s
    room, one of the nurses grew curious and asked Parfit what he did for a living
    to which he replied: ‘I work on what matters.’ As Edmonds relates, Parfit’s understanding
    of what matters centred on answering the notoriously knotty question of the objectivity
    of morality:'

  zh: 该书的第一页让读者毫无疑问地了解到主人公对自己所做事情的严肃性。埃德蒙兹以帕菲特晚年因肺部突然功能衰竭而住院的一个片段开篇。当一名护士观察到进入病房的一波波访客时，她对帕菲特从事何种职业产生了好奇，于是问他：“您是做什么工作的？”他回答道：“我致力于重要的事情。”正如埃德蒙兹所述，帕菲特对于重要性的理解集中在回答道德客观性这一臭名昭著的棘手问题上：
- en: '[Parfit] felt that he had to demonstrate that secular morality – morality without
    God – was objective, and that it had rational foundations. Just as there were
    facts about animals and flowers, stones and waterfalls, books and laptops, so
    there were facts about morality. He genuinely believed that if he failed to show
    this, his existence would have been futile. And not just his existence. If morality
    was not objective, all our lives were meaningless. The need to refute this, the
    need to save morality, was a heavy emotional as well as intellectual burden.'

- en: Does Edmonds achieve his goal? The verdict must be ‘only partially’. On the
    credit side, he has produced a meticulously researched, revealing and, on the
    whole, enjoyable cradle-to-grave account of one of the more influential academic
    philosophers of the last fifty years. Prior to the publication of Edmonds’s four-hundred-page
    tome, the most detailed account of Parfit’s life was Jonathan Dancy’s twenty-page
    tribute to the philosopher, published by the British Academy in 2020 (and oddly
    absent from Edmonds’s bibliography). Edmonds adds considerable flesh to the bones
    of Dancy’s memoir. We are told about Parfit’s parents, Jessie and Norman, from
    their childhood, university years, courtship and marriage, their time as Christian
    missionaries in China in the 1930s, the birth of their three offspring, gradual
    disillusionment with religion, through to their eventual return to postwar England.
    We are also informed about Jessie’s intelligence, kindness and resilience, Norman’s
    progressive feelings of inferiority, frustration and resentment, the contrasting
    fortunes of their respective careers as doctors, and finally their retirement
    and dotage. We learn a great deal about Derek’s childhood, his dazzling cleverness
    from an early age and seemingly effortless success in securing the top scholarships
    to Eton and Balliol College, Oxford, and his talent as a debater, poet and editor.
    Edmonds also recounts Derek’s early romantic involvements, the virtual inevitability
    of achieving a First (in history) in his finals, followed by a coveted two-year
    Harkness Fellowship to the US, and how he capped things off on his return to Oxford
    with a Prize Fellowship at All Souls College in 1967\. The one hiccup along the
    way occurred on his first attempt to gain entry to Oxford’s most exalted college,
    although this failure was perceived even at the time only as a temporary setback
    – John Sparrow, then Warden of All Souls, confided in the crestfallen candidate
    that he was within a hair’s breadth of securing the blue riband award and advised
    him to try a second time.

    Edmonds 这四百页的专著出版之前，对 Parfit 生活的最详细的叙述是 Jonathan Dancy 于2020年由英国学院出版的二十页好友给那位哲学家的致敬（却不知道为何并未出现在
    Edmonds 的参考文献中）。Edmonds 对 Dancy 的回忆增添了大量的内容。我们了解了 Parfit 的父母，杰西和诺曼，从他们的童年，大学时代，相识，婚姻，到他们在1930年代作为基督教传教士前往中国的时间，他们的三个孩子的出生，对宗教的逐渐幻灭，再到他们最终回到战后的英格兰。我们还了解到了杰西的聪慧，善良和坚韧，诺曼的逐渐产生的自卑感，挫折感和怨恨，作为医生他们各自职业发展的截然不同的命运，最后是他们的退休和晚年。我们对
    Derek 的童年了解颇多，他从小就展现出的惊人的聪明才智和貌似毫不费力地赢得前往伊顿公学和牛津大学巴利奥尔学院最高奖学金的成功，以及他作为辩论家，诗人和编辑的天赋。Edmonds
    还叙述了 Derek 的早期的恋情，他在历史专业期末毫不意外地获得第一等级后（接着是获得了通向美国两年的哈克内斯奖学金，并且在1967年回到牛津后达到了可以在阿尔索思学院享有没领奖学金的水平）。途中唯一的一个小插曲发生在他首次尝试进入牛津最崇高的学院时，尽管这个失败在当时被看做只是一个暂时的挫折
    - 那时的阿尔索思学- 院院长约翰·斯帕罗对心灰意冷的候选者说他实际上只差了一点点就能获得这一最高的奖项，并建议他再次尝试。
- en: Academically speaking, being a fellow of All Souls is equivalent to being a
    member of the Institute for Advanced Studies in Princeton ‑ incumbents are free
    to engage in their own research, unhampered by the duties and burdens of teaching.
    This privilege, which he would end up enjoying for the remainder of his professional
    life, marked a turning point for Parfit. Having fallen under the spell of philosophy
    during his time in the US, he was now free to pursue what would become his lifelong
    passion. It also meant that his inclination to engage in intense, solitary study
    was given free rein, resulting in his becoming more obsessive and removed from
    the everyday world. All Souls provided the perfect, and perhaps only, place where
    Parfit the philosopher could flourish – one wonders what would have become of
    him as a philosopher and a person if he hadn’t been admitted a fellow. Edmonds
    brings out splendidly his subject’s increasingly eccentric ways within the walls
    of what is a most peculiar yet fascinating institution.

  zh: 从学术角度来看，成为All Souls的院士相当于成为普林斯顿高级研究院的成员——在此期间，任职者可以自由进行自己的研究，不受教学任务和负担的限制。对Parfit而言，这种特权标志着一个转折点，他将在职业生涯的余生中享受到这一特权。在美国的时候，他深深迷恋上了哲学，现在他可以自由地追求成为他一生的热爱。这也意味着他倾向于进行深入的独立研究，结果变得更加偏执和脱离日常世界。All
    Souls提供了Parfit作为哲学家能够茁壮成长的完美场所——人们不禁想象，如果他没有被录取为院士，他作为一名哲学家和一个人会变成什么样子。Edmonds精彩地展现了他的主题在这个最独特而又迷人的机构内愈发古怪的方式。
- en: Parfit’s arrival at All Souls also prompts a change of gear in the biography
    as narrative gives way to a more thematic approach. The pattern of his life became
    increasingly fixed and ascetic from the early 1970s; he spent the vast majority
    of his time in hermit-like isolation, punctuated by annual teaching stints in
    the US. Apart from the show taking place between his ears, few noteworthy events
    took place in his life. Those that did get a thorough airing by Edmonds. They
    include the so-called ‘Parfit Scandal’; his passion for photography; his romantic
    relationships (initially with the philosopher Susan Hurley, the first woman to
    be made a fellow of All Souls, and later his long-term partnership and eventual
    marriage to another notable philosopher, Janet Radcliffe-Richards); finally, his
    intellectual friendships and associations with various colleagues and graduate
    students.

  zh: Parfit来到All Souls后，传记的叙事方式发生了变化，更多地采用了主题化的方法。从1970年代初开始，他的生活模式变得越来越固定和禁欲；他几乎把大部分时间都花在了类似隐士般的孤独中，偶尔在美国进行一年一度的教学工作。除了在他头脑中进行的展示外，他的生活中几乎没有什么值得注意的事件。这些事件在Edmonds的描述中得到了详细的阐述。其中包括所谓的“帕菲特丑闻”；他对摄影的热情；他的恋爱关系（最初是与哲学家苏珊·赫利，第一个被选为All
    Souls院士的女性，后来是与另一位知名哲学家詹妮特·拉德克利夫-理查兹的长期伴侣关系和最终的婚姻）；最后是他与各种同事和研究生的智识友谊和联系。
- en: ‘The Parfit Scandal’ (the longest chapter in the book) took place in 1981; I
    apply quotation marks as readers unfamiliar with the precious world of All Souls
    will most likely be puzzled about how the incident qualifies as a scandal. Having
    had his initial seven-year prize fellowship upgraded in 1974 to a seven-year junior
    fellowship and looking forward to the prospect of securing tenure with elevation
    to a senior research fellowship, Parfit found himself unexpectedly facing the
    biggest challenge of his life. A number of fellows raised concerns about his academic
    record; in applying for the position he then occupied he had promised books ‑
    which had not appeared, and some judged that this put the college in a very bad
    light. The upshot was that he was given an ultimatum to publish or perish. He
    was allotted two more years to produce a work worthy of earning him a senior fellowship
    at Oxford’s most elite college. Under pressure, he managed to produce the goods
    by the deadline; *Reasons and* *Persons*, published in 1984, was instantly declared
    a work of genius by a number of eminent philosophers. His beloved college duly
    awarded him the ultimate prize, which meant a job for life.

  zh: “Parfit丑闻”（这本书中最长的一章）发生在1981年；我用引号是因为不熟悉All Souls的读者很可能会对这件事如何算是丑闻感到困惑。1974年，他的最初的七年奖学金被提升为七年的初级研究员奖学金，并期待着能够获得终身职位并晋升为高级研究员奖学金，但他意外地面临着他一生中最大的挑战。一些同僚对他的学术记录提出了担忧；在申请他当时所担任的职位时，他曾承诺过一些书籍
    - 但这些书籍并没有出版，一些人认为这给学院带来了很坏的影响。结果是，他被给予一个出版或灭亡的最后通牒。他被分配了两年的时间来出版一部足以让他获得牛津最精英学院高级研究员奖学金的作品。在压力下，他在截止日期前设法完成了任务；《理由与人》于1984年出版，立即被多位著名哲学家宣布为天才之作。他心爱的学院随即授予了他终身职位，这意味着他有了终身的工作。
- en: Parfit’s interest in photography began at an early age after he was given a
    camera as a gift by a rich uncle, but it was only later that his enthusiasm for
    it rivalled his obsession with philosophy. From the 1970s on he would go on regular
    trips to Venice and St Petersburg to photograph what he regarded as the most exquisite
    buildings in the world. The book reproduces in colour several of these photographs,
    featuring The Winter Palace and San Giorgio Maggiore, taken at either dawn or
    dusk. None of them includes people. Edmonds asks whether Parfit’s photography
    sheds any light on his philosophy and suggests, rightly it seems to me, that any
    connections between the two are tenuous. His chapter on the subject, however,
    discusses an event that illustrates just how deeply eccentric Parfit was. A close
    colleague of his, Larry Temkin, was visibly struck by one of Parfit’s photographs
    while visiting his rooms. It was a photo of Oxford’s Radcliffe Library, on which
    Parfit had spent a huge amount of time and a very considerable amount of money
    to achieve a specifically desired aesthetic effect. When Parfit was visiting Temkin
    a year later in the US he emptied his travel bag and pulled from its contents
    a crumpled-up photograph that he handed to Temkin as a gift. It was the same photograph
    but almost damaged beyond repair.

  zh: Parfit对摄影的兴趣始于他很小的时候，当时他得到了一个相机作为富有的叔叔的礼物，但直到后来，他对摄影的热情才与他对哲学的痴迷相媲美。从1970年代开始，他经常前往威尼斯和圣彼得堡，拍摄他认为是世界上最精致建筑的照片。这本书以彩色图片的形式重现了其中几张，包括冬宫和圣乔治大教堂，拍摄时要么是黎明，要么是黄昏。其中没有一张包含人物。埃德蒙兹问道，Parfit的摄影是否为他的哲学提供了任何启示，并建议，我认为是正确的，两者之间的任何联系都很薄弱。然而，他对这个主题的章节讨论了一个事件，说明了Parfit有多么怪异。他的一位亲密同事，拉里·泰姆金，在拜访他的房间时，显然被Parfit的一张照片所震撼。这是牛津的拉德克利夫图书馆的照片，Parfit为了达到特定的审美效果而花费了大量时间和相当可观的金钱。一年后，当Parfit去美国拜访泰姆金时，他从旅行包中取出了一张皱巴巴的照片，并把它作为礼物递给了泰姆金。那是同一张照片，但几乎已经损坏到无法修复的程度。
- en: 'The photo on the cover of Edmonds’s book was taken by the strikingly beautiful
    Susan Hurley. Parfit had campaigned energetically for Hurley’s election as a fellow
    of the college and Hurley in turn provided expert assistance to an exhausted Parfit
    as he completed the final part of *Reasons and Persons*. An intense romance ensued
    but irreconcilable differences, mainly about priorities, meant their relationship
    did not last beyond a year. Not long afterwards he met Janet Radcliffe-Richards,
    whom he wooed by posting a love letter critiquing her book *The Sceptical Feminist*.
    Parfit had more in common with Janet, including a commitment to scholarly perfectionism
    and a settled disinclination to having children. His relationship with her didn’t
    inhibit him from continuing to devote his days (and nights) to solitary study.
    Although she described herself as ‘a sideshow in his life’ and wrote that ‘I can’t
    think of anything we did together that wasn’t what he wanted to do’, their relationship
    appears to have worked for both of them and to have flourished in its own strange
    way until the end. However, as Edmonds drolly remarks, their marital arrangement
    tested the validity of the stock example of a necessary truth: ‘All bachelors
    are unmarried men.’'

    则在 Parfit 筋疲力竭地完成《理由与人》的最后部分时提供了专业的帮助。一段激烈的恋情随之而来，但由于关于优先事务的不可调和差异，他们的关系未能维持超过一年。不久之后，他遇见了
    Janet Radcliffe-Richards，他通过寄送一封批评她的书《怀疑的女权主义者》的情书来追求她。Parfit 与 Janet 有更多共同点，包括对学术完美主义的承诺和对不愿意生育的坚定不愿。他们的关系并未阻碍他继续全身心地投入到独自学习中。尽管她自称“他生活中的一个次要角色”，并写道“我们一起做的任何事情都是他想做的事情”，但他们的关系似乎对双方都有效，并在其独特的方式中蓬勃发展，直至最后。然而，正如
    Edmonds 幽默地指出的那样，他们的婚姻安排考验了“所有单身汉都是未婚男子”的必然真理的有效性。

    was prepared to take a temporary break from his own work. Though there was often
    an overlap of interest between what he was working on and what he discussed with
    philosophical colleagues and students, he did show a level of interest and commitment
    to the work of others that went well beyond the call of duty. The acuity and detail
    of his comments, together with the speed with which he turned around people’s
    work, was staggering. He paid especially scrupulous attention to the work of his
    doctoral students. However, as the years progressed and as he became not just
    more eccentric but progressively obsessive about his own philosophical work, his
    openness to dissenting voices gradually narrowed. One philosopher commented on

    Parfit 在智力上的顽固性与早年的 Parfit 形成鲜明对比，“他想要打开而不是关闭，他希望人们感到兴奋而不是同意”。
- en: The growing philosophical dogmatism of the later Parfit coincided with his obsession
    with the question of the objectivity (or otherwise) of morals. While the problem
    of moral objectivity (or moral realism) has taken different forms over the ages,
    its essence can be stated simply and concisely enough. Are we to believe that
    there is such a thing as an objective morality in the sense of being non-subjectively
    and non-relatively true or are we to regard morality as fundamentally subjective,
    as a phenomenon that is ultimately as arbitrary as a particular individual’s or
    culture’s culinary tastes? We are keen to describe murder as objectively wrong
    and yet we also feel bound to recognise the undeniable fact that the moral codes
    of individuals and societies are a function of historical contingency. What makes
    this a philosophical problem is that there appear to be good reasons for thinking
    two incompatible things – that, on the one hand, morality is something that can
    and should be considered objectively and universally true and, on the other, that
    it is an entirely subjective affair. Since we cannot attribute two conflicting
    properties to morality it would seem that something has to give.

  zh: 后期帕菲特的哲学教条主义与他对道德客观性（或否定性）的问题的痴迷相一致。虽然道德客观性（或道德现实主义）的问题在历史上曾经以不同的形式出现，但其本质可以简单而简洁地陈述。我们是否应该相信有一种客观道德存在，即非主观和非相对真实，还是应该将道德视为根本上是主观的，作为一个最终像特定个人或文化的烹饪口味一样武断的现象？我们渴望将谋杀描述为客观错误，但我们也感到必须承认一个不可否认的事实，即个人和社会的道德准则是历史偶然性的一个功能。这成为一个哲学问题的原因在于，有充分的理由认为两种不相容的事情
    - 一方面，道德是可以和应该被认为是客观和普遍真实的，另一方面，它是一个完全主观的事务。由于我们不能将两种相冲突的属性归于道德，似乎必须有所妥协。
- en: 'The modern form of the philosophical (or meta-ethical) problem of moral realism
    may be thought to confront a greater test than its predecessors. Its peculiar
    challenge was famously expressed in Dostoevsky’s *The Brothers Karamazov*: ‘If
    God is dead, then everything is permitted.’ Premodern responses to the question
    of moral realism tended to come down in favour of ethical objectivism, either
    by invoking the authority of an all good, omniscient and ubiquitous God (as with
    Aquinas) or by endowing the cosmos or human nature (as with Aristotle) with a
    purposeful moral identity. However, the disenchantment associated with modernity
    diminished the credibility of traditional forms of moral realism while raising
    profound doubts about the very existence and coherence of moral knowledge. Philosophical
    wisdom now appeared to be on the side of ethical scepticism and even nihilism.
    Among the more influential philosophical doctrines of the twentieth century was
    logical positivism which claimed that moral statements are essentially meaningless
    since they are factually uncheckable. Ethical judgements were defined by the leading
    English proponent of logical positivism, Freddie Ayer (1910-1989), as emotional

- en: The early philosophical Parfit, from 1967 to the publication of *Reasons and

    linguistic philosophy – two schools of philosophy that sought to deflate or, in
    the latter case, dissolve the objectivist pretensions of morality and its philosophical
    exponents. During this period he wrote moral and political philosophy of the full-blooded,
    normatively recommending sort in the same vein as John Rawls’s *A Theory of Justice*
    and Peter Singer’s *Practical Ethics*. The later Parfit, from roughly the early
    1990s until his death in 2017 – and culminating with the publication of his second
    major work, the three-volume *On What Matters* (vols I & II published in 2011
    & vol III published posthumously in 2017) ‑ continued to focus on addressing substantive
    moral and political problems. But during this time he also became increasingly
    obsessed with the more theoretical question of the philosophical status of morality.
    Put slightly differently, his interest in what he regarded as ‘what matters’ was
    as much concerned with establishing that ‘what matters’ really does matter as
    it was with generating a systematically normative moral theory that would define
    the content and implications of an objective morality.

    What Matters）（第一卷和第二卷分别于2011年出版，第三卷在他去世后于2017年出版）作为高潮——继续专注于解决实质性的道德和政治问题。但在这段时间里，他对道德的哲学地位的理论性问题也变得越来越着迷。换句话说，他对于他认为的“重要的事”感兴趣，不仅仅是为了确定“重要的事”真的很重要，而且还致力于生成一个系统的规范道德理论，以定义客观道德的内容和含义。

    of a vital continuity between conceptions of the philosophical authority of morality
    and particular moral theories and doctrines. He had no time for the once dominant
    viewpoint in analytic circles that moral philosophy should be pursued in a value-free
    way, that the business of a professional philosopher is to analyse and elucidate
    the meaning of moral terms but to resist engaging in substantive moral debate.
    One of the advantages of reading history as an undergraduate was that he avoided
    being infected by the stridently inhibiting and arid strain of postwar analytic
    moral philosophy. His approach to the subject was from the start refreshingly

- en: The other major features of Parfit’s ambitious moral vision invite more criticism.
    It’s one thing to state that the question of the objectivity of morality is a
    legitimate one and quite another to claim that morality’s objectivity can be demonstrated
    beyond all reasonable doubt. Of course Parfit might have responded by declaring
    that the purpose of confronting the question of the objectivity of morality is
    to solve it and that’s precisely what he was seeking to fulfil in *On What Matters*.
    There are at least two problems with this kind of reply. The first is that it’s
    far from clear that the problem of ethical objectivity is susceptible to the type
    of definitive solution Parfit felt he had achieved. Indeed the flaws and inadequacies
    of his ‘solution’ act as a negative reminder of why the more stubborn problems
    of philosophy are probably insoluble but no less genuine and pressing for that.
    The second is that a moral theory which claims to have finally solved the problem
    of moral objectivity is bound to raise more than a *soupçon* of scepticism. These
    objections are related. Those who have doubts about the kind of moral philosophy
    put forward in *On What Matters* are likely to have doubts about the viability
    of settling the problem of moral realism once and for all. Two types of fundamental
    doubt about Parfit’s outlook can be stated briefly.

  zh: Parfit 雄心勃勃的道德愿景的另一个主要特征引起了更多批评。声明道德客观性的问题是合法的一回事，而宣称道德的客观性可以在所有合理的怀疑之外得到证明则完全是另一回事。当然，Parfit
    可能会回应说，直面道德客观性问题的目的是解决它，这正是他在《关于重要性的事》中试图实现的。这种回答至少有两个问题。第一个问题是，道德客观性的问题是否能够接受
    Parfit 认为自己已经实现的那种明确解决方案，远非明显。事实上，他的‘解决方案’的缺陷和不足充当了负面提醒，说明哲学中更为顽固的问题可能是无法解决的，但这并不减少其真实性和迫切性。第二个问题是，声称最终解决了道德客观性问题的道德理论必然会引起更多怀疑。这些反对意见是相关的。那些对《关于重要性的事》中提出的道德哲学类型表示怀疑的人可能会对一劳永逸地解决道德现实主义问题的可行性表示怀疑。对
    Parfit 观点的两种基本怀疑可以简要概括为。

    a quality of otherworldly abstraction that is typical of a still influential brand
    of introspective analytic philosophy. Among the specific hallmarks of this particular
    approach to the subject are a bias towards theoretical unity, a fondness for elaborate
    thought experiments, and an obliviousness to the deep historical contingency of
    human reality coupled with a view of philosophical problems as essentially timeless.
    Simply stating these characteristics of Parfit’s mode of philosophy is not sufficient
    grounds to dismiss it but it should give us cause for scepticism concerning the
    more immodest claims made in its behalf. As a general rule, the interests of philosophy
    are not well-served by either its boosters or its knockers. Parfit was one of

    this event is so recent, Non-Religious Ethics is at a very early stage. We cannot

    that each will fit into place in some single, interlocking, consistent conceptual
    scheme. Not only is there no reason to assume this, but all historical probability
    is against it, especially in the case of language derived from such various civilizations

    whole? The evidence would suggest otherwise: that is, that an irreducible conflict

    Monists like Parfit perceive the undeniable fact of moral disagreement as an avoidable
    state of affairs and one that can be eliminated through the application of human
    reason. And moral monists also tend to believe, as Parfit unequivocally did, that
    the only coherent form of moral realism is moral monism ‑ in other words, that

- en: But moral monism and moral nihilism do not exhaust the options for making sense
    of humanity. There is at least one other credible way of understanding morality,
    which is known as pluralism. Value or ethical pluralism doesn’t so much provide
    a middle ground between moral absolutism and moral nihilism as redefine the contours
    of the moral landscape. Pluralists argue, on the one hand, that the conflict between
    human values and ideals is inescapable in theory as well as in practice and, on
    the other, that there is no clinching reason to deny that moral disagreement is
    compatible with moral realism. For pluralists, the existence of irreducible conflict
    between human ideals reveals that morality is objective and rational rather than
    merely subjective and relative. For example, the conflict between freedom and
    equality or between patriotism and friendship or even between less morally impregnated
    values such as open-mindedness, discretion, humility and truthfulness is about
    as philosophically real as human reality permits. Moreover, a recognition that
    ideals and values inevitably compete and collide is liable to prompt a certain
    curiosity about where they came from and why some have proven more steadfast than
    others over time. Such curiosity is bound to make us more historically and culturally
    self-aware, and, if we have a philosophical turn of mind, to want to make philosophy
    a more historically informed and self-conscious discipline. It’s worth highlighting
    in this context that of all the critics who troubled Parfit none troubled him
    more than Bernard Williams (1929-2003). Williams was as brilliantly clever and
    quick as Parfit and, like Parfit, he chose moral and political philosophy as his
    main area of focus. Yet Parfit was unable to convince Williams of the basic validity
    of his view of morality and, as Edmonds reports, he became increasingly perplexed
    by his failure to do so. But the reason extends much wider and deeper than Parfit
    or Edmonds intimate. Williams was a radical pluralist who regarded the kind of
    monistic, ahistorical moral theory put forward by Parfit as not so much wrong
    as pre-wrong.

  zh: 但是道德一元论和道德虚无主义并不能穷尽理解人类道德的选择。至少还有一种可信的理解道德的方式，称为多元主义。价值或道德的多元主义并不是提供道德绝对主义和道德虚无主义之间的中间立场，而是重新定义了道德景观的轮廓。多元主义者一方面认为，人类价值观念和理想之间的冲突在理论上和实践上都是不可避免的，另一方面认为，没有确凿的理由否认道德分歧与道德现实主义是相容的。对于多元主义者来说，人类理想之间的不可归约冲突表明道德是客观和理性的，而不仅仅是主观和相对的。例如，自由与平等之间的冲突，或者爱国主义与友谊之间的冲突，甚至是像开明、谨慎、谦逊和真诚等较少道德含义的价值观之间的冲突，在哲学上都是与人类现实一样真实的。此外，承认理想和价值观不可避免地竞争和碰撞可能会引发一种对它们来自何处以及为什么一些价值观随着时间的推移更为坚定的好奇心。这种好奇心必然会使我们在历史和文化上更加自觉，如果我们有一种哲学倾向，会希望使哲学成为一门更具历史意识和自我意识的学科。值得在这个背景下强调的是，与所有困扰帕菲特的批评家相比，没有人比伯纳德·威廉姆斯（1929-2003）更为困扰他。威廉姆斯和帕菲特一样聪明而敏捷，而且，像帕菲特一样，他选择道德和政治哲学作为他的主要关注领域。然而，帕菲特无法说服威廉姆斯接受他对道德基本有效性的观点，正如埃德蒙兹所报道的，他对自己未能这样做感到越来越困惑。但是原因远远超出了帕菲特或埃德蒙兹的范围。威廉姆斯是一个激进的多元主义者，他认为帕菲特提出的那种一元、非历史性的道德理论不是错误，而是预先错误。
- en: Does this mean that pluralism is straightforwardly right and monism straightforwardly
    wrong? No. Nor does it mean that pluralism is unstraightforwardly right and monism
    unstraightforwardly wrong. A better way of framing the nature of the contrast
    between Parfit and Williams is to see it in terms of Raphael’s celebrated portrayal
    of Plato and Aristotle in his *The School of Athens*. Plato is pointing upwards
    to the heavens, and Aristotle down to the earth. Philosophy is a broad church
    that can accommodate idealists and pragmatists, objectivists and sceptics, monists
    and pluralists and it’s important that it does. In its most authentic form as
    a discipline exemplifying rigorous, independent, truth-oriented thought, philosophy
    is a friend of diversity and dissent and an enemy of dogmatism and crude dichotomies.
    Williams may exemplify a more historically inflected conception of philosophy
    as a humanistic discipline, but he also leaves us with several perplexing questions
    such as what prevents his bleak realism from collapsing into nihilism? Similarly,
    we may regard aspects of Parfit’s outlook as possessing a fairy-tale quality without
    denying the originality of his account of what a non-naturalistic species of moral
    realism amounts to. Intellectual dissent may be the engine of philosophy but it’s
    also true that genuine philosophy shares a respect for a core set of intellectual
    virtues and a concern about their corresponding vices. Williams may disagree profoundly
    with Parfit’s view of moral philosophy and vice versa but both are at one in their
    commitment to objectivity and truth.

- en: 'More absorbing is Edmonds’s attempt to offer a speculative explanation of the
    psychological trajectory of Parfit’s life. He declares at the start of the book
    that he changed his mind three times about Parfit the person but we have to wait
    until the end of the final chapter, before he discloses what caused him to change
    his mind. There he says he began with the view that Parfit had Asperger’s Syndrome,
    now officially known as Autistic Spectrum Disorder (ASD), and that this manifested
    itself most obviously in his extreme literal-mindedness, narrow and obsessional
    concerns and failure to register social signs. However, Edmonds developed major
    doubts about this viewpoint when he reflected on the contrast between early (pre-1970s)
    sociable Parfit and the late (post-1980s) solitary Parfit: one either has autism
    or one doesn’t. More recent research into ASD provides a possible answer with
    its discovery that those who suffer from it often develop ways to mask their disorder
    and that these masking strategies can be more or less successful. Edmonds thinks
    these findings may provide a more plausible explanation of the psychological-behavioural
    discontinuity in Parfit’s life; he successfully masked his autism in the early
    part of his life but that the mask became more difficult and unnecessary in the
    latter half of his life. The difficulty asserted itself when Parfit faced the
    crisis of being rebuffed for promotion in 1981 which was then exacerbated by having
    to engage in two intense years of manic study to produce his first book. The inexpediency
    of maintaining a mask arose after he was granted tenure – All Souls is not a club
    that requires its members to be psychologically well-adjusted or socially competent.
    Edmonds adds a third twist to his diagnosis by attributing a layer of agency to
    his subject with the suggestion that Parfit judged himself to have a rare ability
    to solve a major intellectual problem and that he consciously dedicated his genius
    to the full-time task of solving it with missionary zeal.'

  zh: 更吸引人的是Edmonds尝试提供对Parfit生活心理轨迹的推测解释。他在书的开头宣称，他对Parfit这个人改变了三次看法，但我们必须等到最后一章结束才能知道是什么让他改变了看法。在那里，他说他最初认为Parfit患有阿斯伯格氏综合征，现在正式称为自闭症谱系障碍（ASD），并且这主要表现在他极端字面主义，狭隘和过分专注的关注点以及对社交信号的无视。然而，当Edmonds反思早期（1970年前）社交的Parfit和后期（1980年后）孤独的Parfit之间的对比时，他开始对这一观点产生了重大怀疑：一个人要么患有自闭症，要么不患有。对ASD的最新研究提供了一个可能的答案，它发现患有ASD的人经常会发展出掩盖他们的障碍的方式，而这些掩盖策略可能会成功或不成功。Edmonds认为这些发现可能提供了一个更有说服力的解释：Parfit的生活中心理行为上的不连续性；他在生活的前半段成功地掩盖了他的自闭症，但这种掩盖在后半生变得更加困难和不必要。当Parfit在1981年面临晋升遭到拒绝的危机时，这种困难变得更加明显，然后他还不得不投入两年的狂热学习来完成他的第一本书。保持掩护的不明智出现在他获得终身教职后——全灵堂不要求其成员在心理上健全或社交能力强。Edmonds通过提出Parfit自己对待这一诊断的一层代理，并建议Parfit判断自己拥有解决重大智力问题的稀有能力，并且自觉地将他的天赋全职用于以宗教热情解决这个问题。
- en: 'These various speculations share a certain plausibility, but the case of Parfit’s
    psychological profile remains largely inscrutable. One of the more perceptive
    judgements about his personality was put forward by his friend Bill Ewald; ‘he
    never did anything cruel, he also never did anything deeply self-sacrificing’.
    This verdict is given by someone who witnessed at first-hand what many of us would
    consider an unforgiveable act of heartlessness to his colleague and former girlfriend
    Susan Hurley. Hurley had been diagnosed with cancer and had asked Ewald and Parfit
    if they would join her for supper in All Souls for old time’s sake. Parfit declined
    saying he was unavailable and later on in the evening when Ewald and Hurley paid
    a visit to Parfit in his college rooms he shooed them away saying he was too busy
    working on his book. We are told that Parfit would at a later date give Hurley
    the pick of his treasured photographs for her to gift to two wealthy friends who
    had helped her through her cancer treatment. Although this second act of kindness
    hardly redeems the earlier act of callousness, it was enough to prompt Hurley
    to write this odd note to Parfit shortly before she died at the age of fifty-three:'

  zh: 这些不同的猜测有一定的合理性，但 Parfit 的心理特征仍然大部分是不可解的。关于他个性的更为敏锐的评价之一是由他的朋友比尔·伊沃德提出的：“他从未做过残忍的事情，他也从未做过深深的自我牺牲。”
    这个评判是由一个亲眼目睹了他对同事和前女友苏珊·赫利施展了许多人认为是不可原谅的无情行为的人做出的。赫利被诊断出患有癌症，并请求伊沃德和 Parfit 为了往日情谊在
    All Souls 为她一起吃晚餐。Parfit 拒绝了，说他没空，晚上晚些时候，当伊沃德和赫利拜访 Parfit 在他的学院房间时，他赶走了他们，说他忙着写书。我们被告知
    Parfit 在以后的某个时间给了赫利他珍贵的照片供她送给两位曾在她癌症治疗期间帮助她的富有的朋友。虽然这第二个善行几乎无法弥补早期的冷酷行为，但足以促使赫利在她五十三岁去世前不久给
    Parfit 写下这个奇怪的便条：
- en: It’s a strange kind of thank you, for a gift that enabled me to give a gift
    to people who have given so much to me. By doing so I impose on your incredible
    generosity in a strange sort of way […and] it means a very great deal to me.

- en: A less imponderable feature of Edmonds’s book is his handling of Parfit’s philosophical
    doctrines. Edmonds admits that Parfit is a philosopher’s philosopher, which makes
    almost impossible the already very difficult job of combining the story of his
    life with a clear account of his evolving ideas. Edmonds has proven himself a
    fluent and reliable communicator of philosophy to non-specialists over a prolonged
    period but sadly these talents do not serve him well in conveying Parfit’s philosophy
    to the uninitiated. His succinct summaries of various parts of Parfit’s philosophical
    outlook are predictably fluent and engaging but they fail to capture, let alone
    do critical justice to, the overall depth and power of Parfit’s work. It’s akin
    to viewing a large, ambitious and multi-layered painting through a magnifying
    glass which limits the range of its focus to a few of the more obvious features
    of the picture. It’s not that Edmonds’s descriptions are wrong, it’s just that
    they are too disjointed. Dancy’s twenty-page memoir of Parfit, referred to earlier,
    contains more philosophical illumination of his thought than Edmonds’s doorstopper.
    This is philosophy lite in the bad sense.

  zh: Edmonds 的书的一个较少费解的特点是他对 Parfit 的哲学学说的处理。Edmonds 承认 Parfit 是哲学家中的哲学家，这使得将他的生活故事与他不断发展的思想清晰地结合起来的任务几乎不可能完成。Edmonds
    在长时间内已经证明了他是一个对非专业人士交流哲学流利而可靠的传播者，但不幸的是，这些才能并没有使他在向未受过教育的人传达 Parfit 的哲学方面得心应手。他对
    Parfit 哲学观点的简明总结可预料地流畅而引人入胜，但它们未能抓住，更不用说对 Parfit 工作的整体深度和力量进行批判性评价了。这就像通过放大镜观看一幅大型、雄心勃勃且多层次的绘画，这限制了其焦点范围，只能看到一些更明显的图片特征。并不是说
    Edmonds 的描述是错误的，只是说它们太过零散。丹西早些时候提到的对 Parfit 的二十页回忆录包含了比 Edmonds 的庞大著作更多的哲学阐明。这是一种不好的哲学之轻。
- en: 'Readers unacquainted with Parfit’s ideas may have their appetites whetted to
    explore them at first-hand. Those who are more familiar with his work are unlikely
    to discover anything new about his philosophy, but they will learn something about
    the man himself. From both perspectives, *Parfit: A Philosopher and His Mission
    to Save Morality* can be described as something of a curate’s egg.'

  zh: 对于不熟悉帕菲特（Parfit）思想的读者，可能会被刺激去亲自探索。对于更熟悉他的作品的人来说，不太可能发现他的哲学中有什么新东西，但他们会了解到一些关于这个人的事情。从两个角度来看，*帕菲特：一位哲学家及其拯救道德使命*
    可以被描述为某种程度上的牧师蛋。
- en: The book ends with a chapter entitled ‘Parfit’s Gamble’. The gamble was to devote
    the last third of his life, at whatever cost to himself and others, to the task
    of rescuing ethics, of showing that there is an objective secular morality. Edmonds
    claims that it paid off. That verdict seems both premature and unstable. It’s
    too early to tell if  Parfit’s legacy, especially in relation to *On What Matters*,
    will prove enduring ‑ the early signs are not that promising. More fundamentally,
    one might ask whether Parfit deserves the legacy he and his followers would wish.
    That’s a trickier question. One response might be that he certainly did philosophy
    a significant service in keeping some of its deepest problems alive, but that
    the wisdom and relevance of the assumptions, methods and doctrines he brought
    to bear to solve these questions is at best precarious.

  zh: 书的结尾是一个名为“帕菲特的赌注”的章节。这个赌注是把生命的最后三分之一，不管对自己和别人的代价是什么，都奉献给拯救伦理学的任务，展示有客观的世俗道德。爱德蒙兹声称这是成功的。这个判断似乎既过早又不稳定。现在说帕菲特的遗产，特别是与
    *关于什么是重要的* 相关的部分是否会持久，还为时过早 - 早期迹象并不是很乐观。更基本的是，人们可能会问帕菲特是否应该得到他和他的追随者所希望的遗产。这是一个棘手的问题。一个回答可能是，他确实在保持一些最深刻问题活跃方面为哲学做出了重要贡献，但是他所运用的解决这些问题的假设、方法和学说的智慧和相关性至多是不稳固的。
- en: 'Rather than finish on a mixed note, it feels more fitting to end a review of
    a book that is generous to a fault with an anecdote from Parfit’s life that expresses
    the authentically liberal side of his personality and of his conception of philosophy

  zh: 而不是以一个兼收并蓄的音符结束，以一个从帕菲特生活中引出的轶事结束对这本慷慨至极的书的评论更合适，这表达了他的个性和他对哲学及哲学家的理念的真正自由派一面：
- en: 'In 2012, a young student, Jonny Pugh, who was applying ideas from *On What
    Matters* to debates in bioethics, contacted Parfit, who, in his typically generous
    fashion, sent back multiple comments on some draft work. Pugh was at that stage
    in a precarious financial position, after some funding had fallen through, and
    Parfit sent him an encouraging note: ‘If you are forced financially to give up
    the hope of becoming a paid philosopher, as so many excellent philosophers had
    to do in the previous period when funds and jobs were scarce, you should remember
    that you can still be an unpaid philosopher who also does something else.’'

  zh: 2012年，一名年轻学生乔尼·普格（Jonny Pugh）将 *关于什么是重要的* 的思想应用于生物伦理学的辩论中，联系到了帕菲特，后者以他典型的慷慨方式，对一些草稿作品发表了多次评论。普格在那个阶段处于一个不稳定的财务状况，因为一些资金落空，帕菲特给了他一封鼓励的便条：“如果您在财务上被迫放弃成为有薪哲学家的希望，就像在之前资金和工作稀缺的时期那样，许多优秀的哲学家不得不做的那样，您应该记住，您仍然可以成为一名无薪哲学家，同时也做其他事情。”
