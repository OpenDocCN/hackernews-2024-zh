    Princeton University Press,'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The subtitle of David Edmonds’s biography of the English philosopher Derek Parfit
    (1942-2017) is liable to raise more than a few eyebrows. Surely a mission to save
    morality is something only a God-like being could take on. And since God is dead,
    or rather has ceased to be believable, the prospect of rescuing morality must
    have vanished too. So is the subtitle to suggest that Parfit really was blessed
    with superhuman powers? Or are we to read it ironically, perhaps as a satirical
    comment on one philosopher’s exaggerated view of his own importance?

    own view of what he was doing was seriously intended. Edmonds opens with an episode
    when Parfit, in his later years, found himself hospitalised following a sudden
    failure of his lungs. Observing the steady stream of visitors entering the patient’s
    room, one of the nurses grew curious and asked Parfit what he did for a living
    to which he replied: ‘I work on what matters.’ As Edmonds relates, Parfit’s understanding
    of what matters centred on answering the notoriously knotty question of the objectivity
    of morality:'

    there were facts about morality. He genuinely believed that if he failed to show
    this, his existence would have been futile. And not just his existence. If morality
    was not objective, all our lives were meaningless. The need to refute this, the
    need to save morality, was a heavy emotional as well as intellectual burden.'

    credit side, he has produced a meticulously researched, revealing and, on the
    whole, enjoyable cradle-to-grave account of one of the more influential academic
    philosophers of the last fifty years. Prior to the publication of Edmonds’s four-hundred-page
    tome, the most detailed account of Parfit’s life was Jonathan Dancy’s twenty-page
    tribute to the philosopher, published by the British Academy in 2020 (and oddly
    absent from Edmonds’s bibliography). Edmonds adds considerable flesh to the bones
    of Dancy’s memoir. We are told about Parfit’s parents, Jessie and Norman, from
    their childhood, university years, courtship and marriage, their time as Christian
    missionaries in China in the 1930s, the birth of their three offspring, gradual
    disillusionment with religion, through to their eventual return to postwar England.
    We are also informed about Jessie’s intelligence, kindness and resilience, Norman’s
    progressive feelings of inferiority, frustration and resentment, the contrasting
    fortunes of their respective careers as doctors, and finally their retirement
    and dotage. We learn a great deal about Derek’s childhood, his dazzling cleverness
    from an early age and seemingly effortless success in securing the top scholarships
    to Eton and Balliol College, Oxford, and his talent as a debater, poet and editor.
    Edmonds also recounts Derek’s early romantic involvements, the virtual inevitability
    of achieving a First (in history) in his finals, followed by a coveted two-year
    Harkness Fellowship to the US, and how he capped things off on his return to Oxford
    with a Prize Fellowship at All Souls College in 1967\. The one hiccup along the
    way occurred on his first attempt to gain entry to Oxford’s most exalted college,
    although this failure was perceived even at the time only as a temporary setback
    – John Sparrow, then Warden of All Souls, confided in the crestfallen candidate
    that he was within a hair’s breadth of securing the blue riband award and advised
    him to try a second time.

    member of the Institute for Advanced Studies in Princeton ‑ incumbents are free
    to engage in their own research, unhampered by the duties and burdens of teaching.
    This privilege, which he would end up enjoying for the remainder of his professional
    life, marked a turning point for Parfit. Having fallen under the spell of philosophy
    during his time in the US, he was now free to pursue what would become his lifelong
    passion. It also meant that his inclination to engage in intense, solitary study
    was given free rein, resulting in his becoming more obsessive and removed from
    the everyday world. All Souls provided the perfect, and perhaps only, place where
    Parfit the philosopher could flourish – one wonders what would have become of
    him as a philosopher and a person if he hadn’t been admitted a fellow. Edmonds
    brings out splendidly his subject’s increasingly eccentric ways within the walls
    of what is a most peculiar yet fascinating institution.

    as narrative gives way to a more thematic approach. The pattern of his life became
    increasingly fixed and ascetic from the early 1970s; he spent the vast majority
    of his time in hermit-like isolation, punctuated by annual teaching stints in
    the US. Apart from the show taking place between his ears, few noteworthy events
    took place in his life. Those that did get a thorough airing by Edmonds. They
    include the so-called ‘Parfit Scandal’; his passion for photography; his romantic
    relationships (initially with the philosopher Susan Hurley, the first woman to
    be made a fellow of All Souls, and later his long-term partnership and eventual
    marriage to another notable philosopher, Janet Radcliffe-Richards); finally, his
    intellectual friendships and associations with various colleagues and graduate
    students.

    apply quotation marks as readers unfamiliar with the precious world of All Souls
    will most likely be puzzled about how the incident qualifies as a scandal. Having
    had his initial seven-year prize fellowship upgraded in 1974 to a seven-year junior
    fellowship and looking forward to the prospect of securing tenure with elevation
    to a senior research fellowship, Parfit found himself unexpectedly facing the
    biggest challenge of his life. A number of fellows raised concerns about his academic
    record; in applying for the position he then occupied he had promised books ‑
    which had not appeared, and some judged that this put the college in a very bad
    light. The upshot was that he was given an ultimatum to publish or perish. He
    was allotted two more years to produce a work worthy of earning him a senior fellowship
    at Oxford’s most elite college. Under pressure, he managed to produce the goods
    by the deadline; *Reasons and* *Persons*, published in 1984, was instantly declared
    a work of genius by a number of eminent philosophers. His beloved college duly
    awarded him the ultimate prize, which meant a job for life.

    camera as a gift by a rich uncle, but it was only later that his enthusiasm for
    it rivalled his obsession with philosophy. From the 1970s on he would go on regular
    trips to Venice and St Petersburg to photograph what he regarded as the most exquisite
    buildings in the world. The book reproduces in colour several of these photographs,
    featuring The Winter Palace and San Giorgio Maggiore, taken at either dawn or
    dusk. None of them includes people. Edmonds asks whether Parfit’s photography
    sheds any light on his philosophy and suggests, rightly it seems to me, that any
    connections between the two are tenuous. His chapter on the subject, however,
    discusses an event that illustrates just how deeply eccentric Parfit was. A close
    colleague of his, Larry Temkin, was visibly struck by one of Parfit’s photographs
    while visiting his rooms. It was a photo of Oxford’s Radcliffe Library, on which
    Parfit had spent a huge amount of time and a very considerable amount of money
    to achieve a specifically desired aesthetic effect. When Parfit was visiting Temkin
    a year later in the US he emptied his travel bag and pulled from its contents
    a crumpled-up photograph that he handed to Temkin as a gift. It was the same photograph
    but almost damaged beyond repair.

    Susan Hurley. Parfit had campaigned energetically for Hurley’s election as a fellow
    of the college and Hurley in turn provided expert assistance to an exhausted Parfit
    as he completed the final part of *Reasons and Persons*. An intense romance ensued
    but irreconcilable differences, mainly about priorities, meant their relationship
    did not last beyond a year. Not long afterwards he met Janet Radcliffe-Richards,
    whom he wooed by posting a love letter critiquing her book *The Sceptical Feminist*.
    Parfit had more in common with Janet, including a commitment to scholarly perfectionism
    and a settled disinclination to having children. His relationship with her didn’t
    inhibit him from continuing to devote his days (and nights) to solitary study.
    Although she described herself as ‘a sideshow in his life’ and wrote that ‘I can’t
    think of anything we did together that wasn’t what he wanted to do’, their relationship
    appears to have worked for both of them and to have flourished in its own strange
    way until the end. However, as Edmonds drolly remarks, their marital arrangement
    tested the validity of the stock example of a necessary truth: ‘All bachelors
    are unmarried men.’'

    was prepared to take a temporary break from his own work. Though there was often
    an overlap of interest between what he was working on and what he discussed with
    philosophical colleagues and students, he did show a level of interest and commitment
    to the work of others that went well beyond the call of duty. The acuity and detail
    of his comments, together with the speed with which he turned around people’s
    work, was staggering. He paid especially scrupulous attention to the work of his
    doctoral students. However, as the years progressed and as he became not just
    more eccentric but progressively obsessive about his own philosophical work, his
    openness to dissenting voices gradually narrowed. One philosopher commented on
    the later Parfit’s intellectual intransigence by contrasting it with the earlier
    Parfit who ‘wanted to open rather than close, [who] wanted people to be excited
    rather than agree’.

- en: The growing philosophical dogmatism of the later Parfit coincided with his obsession
    with the question of the objectivity (or otherwise) of morals. While the problem
    of moral objectivity (or moral realism) has taken different forms over the ages,
    its essence can be stated simply and concisely enough. Are we to believe that
    there is such a thing as an objective morality in the sense of being non-subjectively
    and non-relatively true or are we to regard morality as fundamentally subjective,
    as a phenomenon that is ultimately as arbitrary as a particular individual’s or
    culture’s culinary tastes? We are keen to describe murder as objectively wrong
    and yet we also feel bound to recognise the undeniable fact that the moral codes
    of individuals and societies are a function of historical contingency. What makes
    this a philosophical problem is that there appear to be good reasons for thinking
    two incompatible things – that, on the one hand, morality is something that can
    and should be considered objectively and universally true and, on the other, that
    it is an entirely subjective affair. Since we cannot attribute two conflicting
    properties to morality it would seem that something has to give.

    may be thought to confront a greater test than its predecessors. Its peculiar
    challenge was famously expressed in Dostoevsky’s *The Brothers Karamazov*: ‘If
    God is dead, then everything is permitted.’ Premodern responses to the question
    of moral realism tended to come down in favour of ethical objectivism, either
    by invoking the authority of an all good, omniscient and ubiquitous God (as with
    Aquinas) or by endowing the cosmos or human nature (as with Aristotle) with a
    purposeful moral identity. However, the disenchantment associated with modernity
    diminished the credibility of traditional forms of moral realism while raising
    profound doubts about the very existence and coherence of moral knowledge. Philosophical
    wisdom now appeared to be on the side of ethical scepticism and even nihilism.
    Among the more influential philosophical doctrines of the twentieth century was
    logical positivism which claimed that moral statements are essentially meaningless
    since they are factually uncheckable. Ethical judgements were defined by the leading
    English proponent of logical positivism, Freddie Ayer (1910-1989), as emotional
    ejaculations entirely devoid of reason.'

- en: The early philosophical Parfit, from 1967 to the publication of *Reasons and
    Persons* in 1984 was largely unaffected by logical positivism and its successor,
    linguistic philosophy – two schools of philosophy that sought to deflate or, in
    the latter case, dissolve the objectivist pretensions of morality and its philosophical
    exponents. During this period he wrote moral and political philosophy of the full-blooded,
    normatively recommending sort in the same vein as John Rawls’s *A Theory of Justice*
    and Peter Singer’s *Practical Ethics*. The later Parfit, from roughly the early
    1990s until his death in 2017 – and culminating with the publication of his second
    major work, the three-volume *On What Matters* (vols I & II published in 2011
    & vol III published posthumously in 2017) ‑ continued to focus on addressing substantive
    moral and political problems. But during this time he also became increasingly
    obsessed with the more theoretical question of the philosophical status of morality.
    Put slightly differently, his interest in what he regarded as ‘what matters’ was
    as much concerned with establishing that ‘what matters’ really does matter as
    it was with generating a systematically normative moral theory that would define
    the content and implications of an objective morality.

    the objective status of morality. These are big, ambitious philosophical themes

    way, that the business of a professional philosopher is to analyse and elucidate
    the meaning of moral terms but to resist engaging in substantive moral debate.

    moral philosophy. His approach to the subject was from the start refreshingly

- en: The other major features of Parfit’s ambitious moral vision invite more criticism.
    It’s one thing to state that the question of the objectivity of morality is a
    legitimate one and quite another to claim that morality’s objectivity can be demonstrated
    beyond all reasonable doubt. Of course Parfit might have responded by declaring
    that the purpose of confronting the question of the objectivity of morality is
    to solve it and that’s precisely what he was seeking to fulfil in *On What Matters*.
    There are at least two problems with this kind of reply. The first is that it’s
    far from clear that the problem of ethical objectivity is susceptible to the type
    of definitive solution Parfit felt he had achieved. Indeed the flaws and inadequacies
    of his ‘solution’ act as a negative reminder of why the more stubborn problems
    of philosophy are probably insoluble but no less genuine and pressing for that.
    The second is that a moral theory which claims to have finally solved the problem
    of moral objectivity is bound to raise more than a *soupçon* of scepticism. These
    objections are related. Those who have doubts about the kind of moral philosophy
    put forward in *On What Matters* are likely to have doubts about the viability
    of settling the problem of moral realism once and for all. Two types of fundamental
    doubt about Parfit’s outlook can be stated briefly.

    approach to the subject are a bias towards theoretical unity, a fondness for elaborate
    thought experiments, and an obliviousness to the deep historical contingency of
    human reality coupled with a view of philosophical problems as essentially timeless.
    Simply stating these characteristics of Parfit’s mode of philosophy is not sufficient
    grounds to dismiss it but it should give us cause for scepticism concerning the
    more immodest claims made in its behalf. As a general rule, the interests of philosophy
    are not well-served by either its boosters or its knockers. Parfit was one of
    philosophy’s most distinguished boosters. He ended his first and arguably better

    on several of philosophy’s most difficult problems. None of this, however, should

    mountain to reach a common moral end. This is a classic instance of moral monism,

    of humanity. There is at least one other credible way of understanding morality,
    which is known as pluralism. Value or ethical pluralism doesn’t so much provide
    a middle ground between moral absolutism and moral nihilism as redefine the contours
    of the moral landscape. Pluralists argue, on the one hand, that the conflict between
    human values and ideals is inescapable in theory as well as in practice and, on
    the other, that there is no clinching reason to deny that moral disagreement is
    compatible with moral realism. For pluralists, the existence of irreducible conflict
    between human ideals reveals that morality is objective and rational rather than
    merely subjective and relative. For example, the conflict between freedom and
    equality or between patriotism and friendship or even between less morally impregnated
    values such as open-mindedness, discretion, humility and truthfulness is about
    as philosophically real as human reality permits. Moreover, a recognition that
    ideals and values inevitably compete and collide is liable to prompt a certain
    curiosity about where they came from and why some have proven more steadfast than
    others over time. Such curiosity is bound to make us more historically and culturally
    self-aware, and, if we have a philosophical turn of mind, to want to make philosophy
    a more historically informed and self-conscious discipline. It’s worth highlighting
    in this context that of all the critics who troubled Parfit none troubled him
    more than Bernard Williams (1929-2003). Williams was as brilliantly clever and
    quick as Parfit and, like Parfit, he chose moral and political philosophy as his
    main area of focus. Yet Parfit was unable to convince Williams of the basic validity
    of his view of morality and, as Edmonds reports, he became increasingly perplexed
    by his failure to do so. But the reason extends much wider and deeper than Parfit
    or Edmonds intimate. Williams was a radical pluralist who regarded the kind of
    monistic, ahistorical moral theory put forward by Parfit as not so much wrong
    as pre-wrong.

    unstraightforwardly wrong. A better way of framing the nature of the contrast
    between Parfit and Williams is to see it in terms of Raphael’s celebrated portrayal
    of Plato and Aristotle in his *The School of Athens*. Plato is pointing upwards
    to the heavens, and Aristotle down to the earth. Philosophy is a broad church
    that can accommodate idealists and pragmatists, objectivists and sceptics, monists
    and pluralists and it’s important that it does. In its most authentic form as
    a discipline exemplifying rigorous, independent, truth-oriented thought, philosophy
    is a friend of diversity and dissent and an enemy of dogmatism and crude dichotomies.
    Williams may exemplify a more historically inflected conception of philosophy
    as a humanistic discipline, but he also leaves us with several perplexing questions
    such as what prevents his bleak realism from collapsing into nihilism? Similarly,
    we may regard aspects of Parfit’s outlook as possessing a fairy-tale quality without
    denying the originality of his account of what a non-naturalistic species of moral
    realism amounts to. Intellectual dissent may be the engine of philosophy but it’s
    also true that genuine philosophy shares a respect for a core set of intellectual
    virtues and a concern about their corresponding vices. Williams may disagree profoundly
    with Parfit’s view of moral philosophy and vice versa but both are at one in their
    commitment to objectivity and truth.

    of critical distance between himself and his subject that one might hope for in

    like Socrates, Nietzsche and Wittgenstein, where the connections between their
    life and thought compel deep and nuanced biographical treatment. If we adopt a
    more oecumenical view of the purpose of intellectual biography the answer is less
    certain. Quite a number of biographies of philosophers have been published in
    last few decades, such as Michael Ignatieff’s *Isaiah Berlin* (1998), Ben Rogers’
    s *A.J. Ayer* (1999), Peter Conradi’s *Iris Murdoch* (2001), and more recently,
    Cheryl Misak’s *Frank Ramsey* (2020), which have shown that an exploration of
    a philosopher’s thought is not the only arresting reason for writing about their
    lives. Each of the aforementioned books reveals to a greater or lesser extent
    that their subjects lived captivating lives beyond what they pondered in their
    armchairs.'

    he arrived there his life became his work. But is it really the case that Parfit’s
    life before 1967 was all that rich, and, more relevantly, that his life merits
    detailed biographical treatment? Even though Parfit’s pre-All Souls’ life was
    more eventful in the everyday sense than what followed, it’s also the case that
    it could be described as distinctly conventional, even predictable. After all,
    the path from Eton to Balliol to All Souls is hardly an untrodden one. Moreover,
    being told *ad nauseam* about the countless accolades young Parfit won at school,
    that his name in French stands for ‘perfect’, that he once borrowed Mascagni’s
    *Cavalleria rusticana* from the local gramophone library ‘whilst his mother chose
    Delius’s *A Mass for Life*’ and so on, hardly counts as fascinating material.
    Even several coy chapter headings – ‘Made in China’, ‘Prepping for Life’, ‘History
    Boy’, ‘An American Dream, ‘Soul Man’, etc strike a rather banal tone, reflecting
    a seemingly eager attempt to make the subject’s life appear interesting.

    psychological trajectory of Parfit’s life. He declares at the start of the book
    that he changed his mind three times about Parfit the person but we have to wait
    until the end of the final chapter, before he discloses what caused him to change
    his mind. There he says he began with the view that Parfit had Asperger’s Syndrome,
    now officially known as Autistic Spectrum Disorder (ASD), and that this manifested
    itself most obviously in his extreme literal-mindedness, narrow and obsessional
    concerns and failure to register social signs. However, Edmonds developed major
    doubts about this viewpoint when he reflected on the contrast between early (pre-1970s)
    sociable Parfit and the late (post-1980s) solitary Parfit: one either has autism
    or one doesn’t. More recent research into ASD provides a possible answer with
    its discovery that those who suffer from it often develop ways to mask their disorder
    and that these masking strategies can be more or less successful. Edmonds thinks
    these findings may provide a more plausible explanation of the psychological-behavioural
    discontinuity in Parfit’s life; he successfully masked his autism in the early
    part of his life but that the mask became more difficult and unnecessary in the
    latter half of his life. The difficulty asserted itself when Parfit faced the
    crisis of being rebuffed for promotion in 1981 which was then exacerbated by having
    to engage in two intense years of manic study to produce his first book. The inexpediency
    of maintaining a mask arose after he was granted tenure – All Souls is not a club
    that requires its members to be psychologically well-adjusted or socially competent.
    Edmonds adds a third twist to his diagnosis by attributing a layer of agency to
    his subject with the suggestion that Parfit judged himself to have a rare ability
    to solve a major intellectual problem and that he consciously dedicated his genius
    to the full-time task of solving it with missionary zeal.'

    psychological profile remains largely inscrutable. One of the more perceptive
    judgements about his personality was put forward by his friend Bill Ewald; ‘he
    never did anything cruel, he also never did anything deeply self-sacrificing’.
    This verdict is given by someone who witnessed at first-hand what many of us would
    consider an unforgiveable act of heartlessness to his colleague and former girlfriend
    Susan Hurley. Hurley had been diagnosed with cancer and had asked Ewald and Parfit
    if they would join her for supper in All Souls for old time’s sake. Parfit declined
    saying he was unavailable and later on in the evening when Ewald and Hurley paid
    a visit to Parfit in his college rooms he shooed them away saying he was too busy
    working on his book. We are told that Parfit would at a later date give Hurley
    the pick of his treasured photographs for her to gift to two wealthy friends who
    had helped her through her cancer treatment. Although this second act of kindness
    hardly redeems the earlier act of callousness, it was enough to prompt Hurley
    to write this odd note to Parfit shortly before she died at the age of fifty-three:'

- en: A less imponderable feature of Edmonds’s book is his handling of Parfit’s philosophical
    doctrines. Edmonds admits that Parfit is a philosopher’s philosopher, which makes
    almost impossible the already very difficult job of combining the story of his
    life with a clear account of his evolving ideas. Edmonds has proven himself a
    fluent and reliable communicator of philosophy to non-specialists over a prolonged
    period but sadly these talents do not serve him well in conveying Parfit’s philosophy
    to the uninitiated. His succinct summaries of various parts of Parfit’s philosophical
    outlook are predictably fluent and engaging but they fail to capture, let alone
    do critical justice to, the overall depth and power of Parfit’s work. It’s akin
    to viewing a large, ambitious and multi-layered painting through a magnifying
    glass which limits the range of its focus to a few of the more obvious features
    of the picture. It’s not that Edmonds’s descriptions are wrong, it’s just that
    they are too disjointed. Dancy’s twenty-page memoir of Parfit, referred to earlier,
    contains more philosophical illumination of his thought than Edmonds’s doorstopper.
    This is philosophy lite in the bad sense.

    explore them at first-hand. Those who are more familiar with his work are unlikely
    to discover anything new about his philosophy, but they will learn something about
    the man himself. From both perspectives, *Parfit: A Philosopher and His Mission
    to Save Morality* can be described as something of a curate’s egg.'

    the last third of his life, at whatever cost to himself and others, to the task
    of rescuing ethics, of showing that there is an objective secular morality. Edmonds
    claims that it paid off. That verdict seems both premature and unstable. It’s
    too early to tell if  Parfit’s legacy, especially in relation to *On What Matters*,
    will prove enduring ‑ the early signs are not that promising. More fundamentally,
    one might ask whether Parfit deserves the legacy he and his followers would wish.
    That’s a trickier question. One response might be that he certainly did philosophy
    a significant service in keeping some of its deepest problems alive, but that
    the wisdom and relevance of the assumptions, methods and doctrines he brought
    to bear to solve these questions is at best precarious.

    fashion, sent back multiple comments on some draft work. Pugh was at that stage
    in a precarious financial position, after some funding had fallen through, and
    Parfit sent him an encouraging note: ‘If you are forced financially to give up
    the hope of becoming a paid philosopher, as so many excellent philosophers had
    to do in the previous period when funds and jobs were scarce, you should remember
    that you can still be an unpaid philosopher who also does something else.’'
