    I don’t want—if you like ’em, keep ’em!) flake off like dead skin. The residual

- en: My addiction to quitting started in seventh grade, when my teacher read some
    meatpacking excerpts from Upton Sinclair’s *The Jungle* out loud in class. “I’m
    not eating meat anymore!” I announced to whoever was listening (likely no one).
    I stood by my word. It was surprisingly easy, even well before the time that supermarkets
    were equipped with freezer sections of meat alternatives. I appreciated having
    a thing to care about. Being a vegetarian contributed to the formation of an identity
    that I could wield like a prize—it made me stand out with the veneer of social
    consciousness. I learned to cook for myself and annoy the shit out of people with
    my decisions. By my midteens, I was well on the road to becoming the man I am
    today.

- en: Quitting smoking was way more difficult than quitting meat. I smoked from about
    age 17 to 26\. Actually, that’s a bit misleading. For most of that time, I didn’t
    merely smoke; I chain-smoked. Virtually always. I could go through three cigarettes
    while watching a 30-minute episode of *The Simpsons* on my freshman dorm-room
    bed. If I wasn’t smoking, I was waiting to smoke. I would rush out of movies and
    restaurants, gasping for nicotine, tar, and carbon monoxide.

  zh: 戒烟比戒肉困难得多。我大约从17岁开始吸烟，一直持续到26岁。实际上，这有点误导人。在那段时间的大部分时间里，我不仅仅是吸烟，我是连续吸烟。几乎总是。我可以在看30分钟的《辛普森一家》剧集时吸完三支烟。如果我不吸烟，我就在等待吸烟。我会从电影院和餐厅里冲出来，渴望尼古丁、焦油和一氧化碳。
- en: I loved smoking, but I regularly felt the crush of addiction. There were times
    I wanted to quit, when I knew I couldn’t afford this habit as the price I was
    paying for cigarettes sprinted past the $10 mark following my move to New York.
    Well before that, in high school, I was so frustrated by my inability to control
    my habit that I threw my pack out in a Wawa parking lot, only to buy another pack
    at a different Wawa a few hours later. I wasn’t exactly in the belly of the beast,

    market the antidepressant’s side effect of helping people get over their smoking
    addiction). It sapped my energy and centrifuged my moods, but it did allow me
    to stop obsessing about cigarettes for enough time to allow the nicotine to leave
    my system. The rest of the work, agonizing inaction, was up to me. The first year
    was such torture that I routinely wished a tragedy would befall me so that I’d
    have a valid excuse to go back to smoking. I’ve never been so addicted to something
    as I was nicotine, and I believe quitting smoking will always be the accomplishment
    of my life. Maybe this sounds sad to you: All that work and suffering just to
    get where I was pre-cigarettes. From the outside, it just looks like a journey
    back to zero.'

  zh: 那真是地狱。我失败了好几次。我使用了丙酮（重新打包成Zyban以推销抗抑郁药的副作用，帮助人们摆脱吸烟成瘾）。它消耗了我的能量，离心了我的情绪，但它确实让我停止了对香烟的过度关注，让尼古丁足够的时间离开我的体系。剩下的工作，令人痛苦的无所作为，就交给我了。第一年是如此的煎熬，以至于我经常希望发生悲剧，这样我就有了一个合理的借口回到吸烟。我从来没有像对尼古丁那样上瘾，我相信戒烟将永远是我生命中的成就。也许这对你来说听起来很可悲：所有这些努力和苦难只是为了回到吸烟前的状态。从外面看，这只是一次回到零的旅程。
- en: 'But in this case, zero isn’t nothing. Quitting smoking came from the quarter-life
    realization of my own mortality, which is to say that for the first time I was
    thinking seriously about the future and what I could do to possibly prolong my
    time there. Consequences—what a concept! Around the time I quit smoking, I began
    running because I wanted to exercise but was terrified of going to the gym and
    looking like I didn’t know what I was doing. (Later, a friend showed me the ropes.)
    Together, quitting smoking and running created an incentivizing system: I knew
    that if I had a cigarette, my lungs would feel terrible the next time I ran. Motivation.
    From the times that I failed—allowing myself one smoke, then smash cut to me tearing
    my way through a pack within just a couple of hours—I learned that I can approach
    this only from a black-and-white perspective. I’m either a chain-smoker or someone
    who hasn’t had a cigarette in more than 18 years. I’m nothing in between. Call
    it keeping momentum or settling into inertia, but I’ve found that I can follow
    a program extremely well. Permissive dabbling is just chaos to my mind.'

  zh: 但在这种情况下，零不等于零。戒烟源于我对自己死亡的四分之一生认识，也就是说，我第一次认真地思考未来以及我可能做些什么来延长我在那里的时间。后果—真是个概念！我戒烟的时候，我开始跑步，因为我想锻炼，但害怕去健身房，害怕看起来像是不知道在做什么。（后来，一个朋友给我指点了一下。）戒烟和跑步一起创造了一种激励系统：我知道如果我吸一支烟，下次跑步时我的肺会感觉很糟糕。动力。从我失败的时候—允许自己吸一支烟，然后切换到我在几个小时内就能抽完一包的情况—我学到了，我只能以黑白的态度来对待这件事。我要么是个烟鬼，要么是个18年多没有抽烟的人。我两者之间什么都不是。叫它保持动力或者陷入惯性，但我发现我可以非常好地遵循一个程序。宽容的摸索对我的思维来说只是混乱。
- en: Maybe the biggest thing about doing this was showing myself I could. In some
    nontraumatic ways, I didn’t feel as if I had agency over my own body as a kid.
    I was clumsy and often felt like I was at the mercy of my own drives, which tended
    to lead me to the pantry and away from exercise. Mindfulness was about as tangible

- en: So, quitting smoking was a triumph of will that I didn’t realize I had, and
    it inspired more abstinence. I weaned myself off drinking half a dozen cans of
    Coke Zero a day in the mid-aughts. I quit weed a few times—at least once in my
    late 20s because I was worried about my memory, and once in my late 30s, because
    every time I got high, I had these 10-minute freakouts in which I was suddenly
    struck by my profound failure as a human harmonized with a feeling that the world
    was ending. Maybe these were panic attacks? I resumed smoking weed when I felt
    better about myself, and I haven’t seen them return.

  zh: 所以，戒烟是我没有意识到的意志力的胜利，并且它激发了更多的戒断。在中期的零年代，我把自己从每天喝下六听可口可乐零度的习惯中戒掉了。我曾经几次戒过大麻—至少在我20多岁时，因为我担心我的记忆力，以及在我30多岁时，因为每次我吸大麻时，我都会陷入这种持续10分钟的恐慌中，在这种恐慌中，我突然被我作为一个人的深刻失败所击倒，并伴随着一种世界末日的感觉。也许这些是惊恐发作？我感觉好一些后又重新开始吸大麻了，而且我没有再次出现这种情况。
- en: In late August 2020, I attended an outdoor party, one of the few I went to that
    summer. I brought a bottle of prosecco with me and probably had about half of
    it when I realized that I was tipsy, and I didn’t like that feeling. I never liked
    alcohol. I always preferred marijuana. But peer pressure wore me down and turned
    me into a social drinker who sometimes went overboard. Throughout my drinking
    tenure, which lasted longer than 20 years, I would tell people that if I never
    drank again, I’d be totally fine. Alcohol dulled me—the opposite effect of weed
    and psychedelics. I’d dabbled with mushrooms and got a sense of mastery of my
    mind and, by extension, my life, so when I told myself that night, *I don’t want
    to do this anymore*, I was determined to stick to it. I figured it would be easy,
    but I had no idea how easy. It was like hanging up a phone. One day, I was someone
    who drank, and the next, I was someone who didn’t.

  zh: 2020年8月底，我参加了一个户外聚会，那个夏天我参加的少之又少。我带了一瓶普罗塞克香槟，大概喝了一半的时候，我意识到我有点醉了，我不喜欢那种感觉。我从来不喜欢酒精。我一直更喜欢大麻。但是同伴的压力逐渐使我放松了警惕，变成了一个有时会过度饮酒的社交者。在我超过20年的饮酒生涯中，我会告诉人们，如果我再也不喝酒，我会完全没问题。酒精使我麻木——与大麻和致幻剂的相反效果。我曾试过蘑菇，对我的头脑和生活有了一种掌控感，所以当那天晚上对自己说，“我不想再这样了”时，我决心坚持下去。我觉得这会很容易，但我不知道有多容易。就像挂断电话一样。有一天，我是一个喝酒的人，第二天，我成了一个不喝酒的人。
- en: Undoubtedly, the social context helped. Were it not for COVID and the resulting
    quarantine, I don’t think I would have had any reason to stop drinking. For years,
    my social life had been centered on alcohol—at bars, restaurants, shows, wherever.
    When that social life shriveled, so did whatever inherent social pressure to keep
    the drinks flowing. Parties, like the one at which I had my minor epiphany (epiphamini?),
    were few and far between. Not drinking had nothing wrapped up in it to make it
    more difficult for me. It was simply … not drinking.

  zh: 毫无疑问，社交背景有所帮助。如果没有新冠肺炎及随之而来的隔离，我想我没有任何理由停止饮酒。多年来，我的社交生活都以酒精为中心——在酒吧、餐馆、演出等地。当社交生活萎缩时，无论与否保持饮酒的内在社会压力也随之减少。聚会，就像我有小顿悟的那个（epiphamini？），少之又少。不喝酒对我来说并没有任何使它更加困难的东西。它只是……不喝酒。
- en: 'Much like quitting smoking and exercising formed an interlocking system of
    obligations and rewards, not drinking fit into my next paring-down endeavor: intermittent
    fasting. After [reading encouraging research](https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/time-to-try-intermittent-fasting)
    about the practice’s potential, I slowly integrated it into my lifestyle, starting
    at 12 hours of fasting, then in a few weeks moving on to 14, then 16, then 18,
    where I’ve (give or take) stayed for nearly three years. The first month was excruciating;
    the 35 or so others have been mostly fine. I’m very strict and allow myself only
    water during my fasting window. Drinking alcohol socially at night (when I almost
    always did) is simply incompatible with intermittent fasting. If I were out at
    a bar till midnight (a conservative curfew, for sure), I wouldn’t be able to open
    my window until 6 p.m. the next day on my current schedule. No thanks!'

- en: I used to allow myself black coffee and tea, but as you probably won’t be surprised
    to learn, I’ve quit caffeine now too. I was drinking about a liter of cold brew
    a day (I made it myself [using Toddy’s “system”](https://toddycafe.com/product/toddy-cold-brew-system)
    and cheap coffee) and figured that that couldn’t be good. Among other things cited
    on caffeine’s effect on sleep in Michael Pollan’s [*This Is Your Mind on Plants*](http://www.amazon.com/dp//?tag=slatmaga-20),
    he notes, “None of the sleep researchers or experts on circadian rhythms whom
    I interviewed for this story use caffeine.” Good enough for me! In 2023 I tapered
    it off week by week for about a month. Unlike the relationship between smoking
    and running, and drinking and fasting, I thought maybe quitting caffeine would
    make fasting more difficult, since on most days, all I had to taste during my
    morning-to-mid-afternoon abstinence was black coffee. But really, that too was
    fine. I don’t miss it very much on a druggy level—I feel perfectly awake without
    it—but sometimes I miss the taste of a good cup of coffee. But then I worry about
    deviating from my “all or nothing”–ness and watching my life slide into immediate
    disarray, with all my hard work undone. So, abstinent I remain.
