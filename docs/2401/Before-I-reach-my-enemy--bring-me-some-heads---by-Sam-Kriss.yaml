    instruments and singing; all folktales are traditionally attributed to him. One
    legend says that Korkut was an ambassador of the Khan to Mohammed: he rode with
    the Prophet on his campaigns and was the first of the Turks to accept Islam. But
    the book also says that he made strange prognostications that all came true, that
    he brought news from unseen and unseeable places, and that he personally heard
    the voice of God. A soothsayer; maybe a shaman. He has his feet in something older
    than Islam. He was in some contact with the other world, the one that lies just
    across the mirror of ice in the tundras and taigas of Siberia. Maybe he didn’t
    like what he saw there. According to tradition, Dede Korkut was terrified of death.
    Rashid al-Din says he lived for nearly three hundred years because he simply refused
    to die. The story goes that Korkut, ancient, withered, used to wander through
    the wastelands of Asia, fleeing death. Whenever he came to a town, he would find
    gravediggers at work. He would ask them whose grave they were digging, and they
    would reply: ‘We heard there is a man called Korkut who is looking for his grave;
    here it is.’ Finally, his wanderings took him to the place where he was born,
    and one of those holes in the ground claimed him. His mausoleum is outside Kyzylorda
    in Kazakhstan, on the banks of the Syr Darya. It was built by a team of Soviet
    architects and physicists in 1980, and contains a series of long tubes and pipes:
    whenever the winds blow across the steppe, the grave produces the sound of a lonely
    bow falling across the strings of a kobys. In a way, Dede Korkut got what he wanted:
    now he sings forever.'

    else in this blurb is a lie, and it’s a lie that actively tries to *blot out*
    what made that society a wild one. It tells you very little about what mattered
    to the Oghuz Turks of the mountains and plains. It does, however, say a lot about
    *us*, about the modern world that tore up the turf of the steppe and planted grain,
    built cities, made machines, and set down the old tales in the pages of a book.
    But that world is now ending: the earth is swallowing it up. Already, small pieces

    of the Grey Horse wants to marry. As a bride-price, Karchar demands a thousand
    camels, a thousand stallions, a thousand rams, a thousand dogs, and a thousand
    fleas. The fleas don’t *manage his unpredictability*, whatever that means; Beyrek
    delivers the other animals and then pushes Karchar into a flea-infested sheepfold.
    Kazan isn’t a particularly distinct figure at all; in some of the stories he’s
    basically interchangeable with his son Uruz. The monster Goggle-eye, or Tepegöz
    in Turkish, is literally just Polyphemus; most of his story is lifted whole-cloth

    you, but for what it’s worth I find it all very beautiful. The great symbolic
    mountain, rising and turning, black in misery, bursting with colours in triumph.
    The entire range of human emotions, expressed in terms of a *river*, trickling,
    eddying, bursting its banks. When the Oghuz poets want to indicate the passing
    of time, they repeat the same phrase: ‘The horse’s hoof is fleet as the wind;
    the minstrel’s tongue is swift as the bird.’ I love it. But then I also keep naming
    my blogs after songs by the Fall. ‘Repetition in China! Repetition in America!
    Repetition in West Germany! Simultaneous suicides!’ Not everyone shares my taste.
    Whoever wrote the blurb to my Penguin Classics edition in 1974 did not trust the

    one man or another may rise up and be famous or fall down and be forgotten but
    all the forms of human life are eternal, as clear and cold as the black mountain

    the Book of Dede Korkut was not originally a book: it was a collection of *songs*.
    They were written down some time in the fourteenth or fifteenth century, once
    the nomadic, illiterate, sky-worshipping Oghuz had become the settled, literate,
    God-fearing Turkomans. At some point, a stratum of Muslim piety was spread over
    the narrative, and stories that had probably been set on the northern borders
    of China were transposed to the eastern borders of Rome. It was probably only
    when they were written down that Homeric elements entered the text: Tepegöz, but
    also Bamsi Beyrek’s return from captivity, which directly mirrors Odysseus’ return
    to Ithaca. (Lewis writes that ‘the alternative is to imagine that Homer borrowed
    some themes which he found circulating orally round western Asia Minor and which,
    still circulating after two millennia, were borrowed once more.’ He shrugs: ‘Well,
    it is not impossible.’) They add a kind of pedigree: the tales of the cold steppes
    are now sewn into the respectable literary culture of the Mediterranean.'

    epithets: the dawn is rosy-fingered, the sea is loud-roaring, Odysseus is much-enduring,
    and Telemachus is godlike, in the same way that the warriors of the Oghuz are
    chestnut-eyed and their Kazilik horses have black manes. In oral cultures, a poet
    is supposed to be able to perform an entire epic narrative from memory; it’s an
    article of faith that each poet recites the material in exactly the same way every
    time. But obviously, they don’t. In the 1950s, the Harvard ethnomusicologist Albert
    Lord produced a vast collection of recordings of the illiterate bards of Yugoslavia;
    he found that they never once gave the exact same rendition twice. But they remembered
    stock phrases, conventions, formulaic units. A poet’s skill was about arranging
    these units together in a pleasing way, and absolutely not about creating anything
    new. The Greek word for the recitation of epic poems was *rhapsody*, and *rhaptein*
    meant to stitch together. At the end of every chapter in the Book of Dede Korkut,
    we hear how ‘Dede Korkut came and told stories and declaimed; he strung together
    this tale of the Oghuz.’'

    were learning to read in the new socialist Yugoslavia—he lost the ability to sing
    his songs. Once the notion of a complete and genuinely unchanging *text* is stuck
    in his mind, it loses its elasticity; he keeps stumbling over the precise wording.
    In *Orality and Literacy*, Walter Ong points out that oral societies often lack
    the concept of a *word*. ‘The sense of individual words as significantly discrete
    items is fostered by writing, which is diaeretic, separative.’ For an oral poet,
    the smallest unit of meaning might have been the black mountain, the bursting

    Today, a *hafiz* is someone who has committed the entire book to memory, but they

    was compiled under Uthman, the third Rashidun Caliph, around 670 AD. Islamic tradition
    holds that before then the Qur’an, being the pristine revelation of God, was perfectly
    preserved by the early Muslims, all of whom were *hafiz*, until it was written
    down. But oral memorisation doesn’t work like that, and some of the hadiths paint
    a different picture. In the *Sahih al-Bukhari*, Ibn Mas’ud narrates: ‘I heard
    a person reciting a Qur’anic verse in a certain way, and I had heard the Prophet
    reciting the same verse in a different way. So I took him to the Prophet and informed
    him of that but I noticed the sign of disapproval on his face, and then he said,
    ‘Both of you are correct, so don’t differ, for the nations before you differed,
    so they were destroyed.’’ Of course both are correct: in an oral culture, *any*

    consist of fragments from the Bible, Hesiod’s *Works and Days*, and the *De re

    this period, but even the lurid hallucinatory visions of Hadewijch or Mechthild

    a familiar Catholic motif. There was no expectation that someone who dared to

    of transmission. Machines can do it instead: suddenly every book appears out of
    nothing. But the implications of print took a while to percolate through our brains.
    (McLuhan notes that in the early days of printing, people would buy an incunabulum
    and then take it to their local scriptorium, to be copied out and illuminated
    by hand.) If there’s a hinge-point, you may as well place it within Thomas Browne’s
    1658 *Urne-Buriall*. The essay has five chapters: the first four try to explain
    the disovery of some Anglo-Saxon tombs through a dense tissue of quotations on
    how various vanished societies handled their dead. So we learn via Gagunius that
    the Sarmatians burned their dead, and via Saxo and Olaus that the Sueons and Gothlanders
    did the same thing. We hear that ‘the *Scythians* who swore by winde and sword,
    that is, by life and death, were so farre from burning their bodies, that they
    declined all interrment, and made their graves in the ayr: And the *Ichthyophagi*
    or fish-eating Nations about Ægypt, affected the Sea for their grave.’ The Gospel
    of Mathew tells us that ‘the rigid Jews were wont to garnish the Sepulchres of
    the righteous.’ And so on. But the fifth chapter is a devastatingly personal reflection
    on the inevitability of death and the futility of all our attempts to survive
    ourselves. You can build huge monuments to yourself: time will wear them down.
    One day, rot will claim the singing grave of Dede Korkut. You can have children,
    but ‘Generations passe while some trees still stand, and old Families last not
    three Oaks.’ You can perform great deeds; they won’t last. The time is coming
    when every book will be lost and every song will be forgotten. ‘The greater part,’
    Browne writes, ‘must be content to be as though they had not been.’ It’s a true

    It was already dying fifty years ago in 1974, when someone at Penguin decided
    to pretend that the Book of Dede Korkut was really a collection of quirky and
    inventive *characters*. It’s roughly coterminous with the age of the novel: starting
    with *Don Quixote*; maybe starting to collapse with Pierre Menard, who could produce
    a word-for-word replica of *Don Quixote* that was an entirely different text,
    simply because it was written by Pierre Menard and not by Miguel de Cervantes.
    As of 2024, that age is very definitively over. You people are—not illiterate,
    exactly, since you do still consume large quantities of text, but maybe *paraliterate*.
    You might be reading, but you’re certainly not reading *books*. Even the rare
    people who do read books sometimes strain with the unexpected effort it requires.
    It wasn’t so difficult when you were a kid! And not only because when you were
    a kid, you were reading cool stories about teenage spies, and now you’re an adult
    you have a copy of Vasily Grossman’s *Life and Fate* by your bedside, nine hundred
    pages thick, silently shaming you every single evening for not having even bothered
    to skim through the translator’s introduction. When you were a kid—sorry, but
    it’s true—we didn’t have all these phones. Digital text has calcified your brain
    in the same way that written text calcified the Yugoslav bards’. It’s not a question
    of *attention span*, because the dominant discursive modes online seems to be
    the multi-hour-long video essay or the interminable live stream in which literally
    nothing is said. But digital text makes the distemporality of ordinary text unbearable.
    To sit still and read a book for hours on the trot, you have to suppress the rising
    itch that starts on your fingertips and spreads everywhere over your skin. Make
    this responsive! Make this refresh! You’re experiencing the agony of the dead
    word of the book, where the future is already set down, waiting for you on the
    final page, where nothing *changes*… Digital text, meanwhile, is *writing that
    functions like speech*. Like speech it happens in real time, right in front of
    you, and then afterwards it sinks into the unreachable abysses of the feed. It’s
    *present*, it’s *alive*, while writing is always spectral and disjointed from
    itself. (Again, see Derrida to learn more than you ever wanted to know about *différance*
    and the ghostly metaphysics of non-presence and the other now-irrelevant features
    of this obsolete world.) This is why digital writing seems to make people much
    *angrier* than ordinary text: it seems to be addressed *to you* in a way that
    the words on a piece of paper do not. This is also why everything that appears
    on the internet is, from the perspective of the age of individuality and the novel,
    so *boring*. This medium does not favour originality. New versions of the epic
    formulas. We call them *memes* now: endlessly repeating pictures of frogs. Or
    TikToks where different people mouth along to the same words. Or the frothing
    opinion-mongers, serving up the same formulaic phrases in service of the same
    predictable positions. Everyone fights their rhetorical battles over and over
    again. In the Book of Dede Korkut, the infidel king Shökli is killed three times;
    another time he’s captured and converts to Islam in exchange for his life. It
    doesn’t matter. As soon as the next tale begins, he’s back where he was, in his
    evil fortress beyond the Iron Gate.'

    there’s something very beautiful about this deranged activity. Imagine a society
    of poets, where everyone spends a lifetime quietly perfecting their art until
    they produce reams of shatteringly beautiful verse—but nobody ever shows anyone
    else what they’ve written, and in the end each poet’s body is burned on top of
    a pile of his works. The difference, though, is that academics desperately *want*
    to be read, to be cited, to take their place in the great chain of repeated words.
    So they plagiarise. It’s not just to cut corners; it’s not just because nobody’s
    checking. They’re yearning for that other world, the one that sings in thundering
    hoofbeats across the dusty plains.'

    the same. The university produces strangled, identical wordings and pretends they’re
    wildly different. The obvious solution is to give up the pretence and return to
    orality: to *legalise and encourage academic plagiarism*. This would make everyone
    much happier and more creative, and also, incidentally, be far more in keeping
    with the true purpose of the university than what we have now. As I’ve mentioned
    before, people have a weird habit of acting as if the university is an institution
    of the Enlightenment, dedicated to the free enquiry of the individual intellect.
    It’s not! The university, alongside the capitalist mode of production, is one
    of the only major institutions that come to us out of the *Middle Ages*. It belongs
    to the age of repetition: the era of Dede Korkut. Maybe, once the stock phrases
    have had a few generations to roll around, academics will stop writing phrases
    like ‘the beginning point for any ecological inference should be,’ and start writing
    phrases like ‘flood of my black river, my son!’'

    the inventive turn of phrase, the cruel demand to make things new. They’ve already
    vanished without too many people noticing: still used as a political weapon, sure,
    but not for much else. The digital technology that dragged us out of our individual
    neuroses will probably not last much longer. We are becoming a tribal, pastoral
    people, and pastoralists have no need for technological progress. Still, we might
    be amazed at the new kinds of communication that become possible. In one of the
    tales of the Book of Dede Korkut, Yigenek son of Kazilik Kojab learns that his
    father is being held captive in the castle of the infidel king Direk. Yigenek
    gathers the Oghuz warriors to rescue him, but that night in his dream he has a
    vision of the great champion Emen, who also happens to be his maternal uncle.
    The dream-Emen tells Yigenek not to attempt this rescue:'

    then he wakes up. Usually, when you have this kind of vision, the person you witness
    is *dead*: they’ve been swallowed by the other world, the one we glimpse in dreams.
    Maybe Emen died in his seventh rescue attempt. But in the morning, the *real*
    Emen arrives to join Yigenek’s army and storm the castle one more time. He’s alive.
    He had the same dream. He was won over by Yigenek’s argument, somewhere in the
    common wordless caverns of the night.'
