    to force an aspect ratio such as 16:9 for video embeds? As of September 2021,
    the `aspect-ratio` property is stable in evergreen browsers and is the only property
    needed to define an aspect ratio.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Of note, an applied `aspect-ratio` is forgiving and will allow content to take
    precedence. This means that when content would cause the element to exceed the
    ratio in at least one dimension, the element will still grow or change shape to
    accommodate the content. To prevent or control this behavior, you can add additional
    dimension properties, like `max-width`, which may be necessary to avoid expanding
    out of a flex or grid container.

    rendered aspect-ratio'

    adding an offset to an element in the context of the scroll position. In other
    words, adding `scroll-padding-top` can increase scroll offset above the element
    but doesn’t affect its layout position within the document.
  prefs: []

    covering content when an anchor link is activated. Using `scroll-margin-top` we

    to account for the space occupied by the sticky nav.

    dark and light themes. The CSS property `color-scheme` is an opt-in to adapting
    browser UI elements including form controls, scrollbars, and CSS system colors.
    The adaptation asks the browser to render those items with either a `light` or
    `dark` scheme, and the property allows defining a preference order.

    been seeking `accent-color`. With this property, you can modify the `:checked`
    appearance of radio buttons and checkboxes and the filled-in state for both the
    progress element and range input. The browser’s default focus “halo” may also
    be adjusted if you do not have another override.

    an element to its contents.

    to reduce an element’s width to the content size, an upgrade to `width: fit-content`
    will achieve the same effect. The advantage of `width: fit-content` is that it
    leaves the `display` value available, thereby not changing the position of the
    element in the layout unless you adjust that as well. The computed box size will
    adjust to the dimensions created by `fit-content`.'

    where overflow is allowed to be scrolled - is that when the scroll runs out in
    the element, the scroll interaction passes to the background page. This can be
    jarring at best, and frustrating at worst for your users.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    region, preventing continuing the scroll by moving it to the parent page once
    the scroll boundary is reached. This is useful in contexts such as a sidebar of

    number of characters per line of text.
  prefs: []

    be an increase in unwanted space next to the text.

    scrollbars in the layout, which prevents that undesirable shift. When there’s

    created in addition to any padding on the scroll container.
  prefs: []

    are *not* for “overlay” scrollbars, as in the default for Mac OS, where the scrollbar

    drop padding in favor of `scrollbar-gutter` since you will lose all intended space
    when overlay scrollbars are in use.'

    property using two keywords: `scrollbar-gutter: stable both-edges`. The use of

    side of the scroll container, too. This ensures visual balance when the layout
    doesn’t yet need scrollbars to be visible. See [a visual of using scrollbar-gutter](https://defensivecss.dev/tip/scrollbar-gutter/)
