    been asking for three years: when will you tax extreme wealth? If elected representatives
    of the world’s leading economies do not take steps to address the dramatic rise
    of economic inequality, the consequences will continue to be catastrophic for
    society.'

    to normality based on a sober assessment of current economic conditions. We are
    the people who invest in startups, shape stock markets, grow businesses, and foster
    sustainable economic growth. We are also the people who benefit most from the
    status quo. But inequality has reached a tipping point, and its cost to our economic,
    societal, and ecological stability risk is severe - and growing every day. In
    short, we need action now.

    will not fundamentally alter our standard of living, nor deprive our children,
    nor harm our nations’ economic growth. But it will turn extreme and unproductive
    private wealth into an investment for our common democratic future.'

    individual action cannot redress the current colossal imbalance. We need our governments
    and our leaders to lead. And so we come to you again with the urgent request that
    you act - unilaterally at the national level, and together on the international
    stage.

    who build better futures. As the wealthiest members of society, we would be:'

    down economics’ has not translated into reality. Instead it has given us stagnating
    wages, crumbling infrastructure, failing public services, and destabilized the
    very institution of democracy. It has created a shameful economic system incapable
    of providing a brighter, more sustainable future. These challenges will only worsen
    if you fail to address extreme wealth inequality.

    vulnerable, but in what it asks of its wealthiest members. Our future is one of
    tax pride, or economic shame. That’s the choice.
