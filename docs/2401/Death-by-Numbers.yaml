- en: One of the most dreaded diseases in early modern London was plague. Starting
    in 1603, government officials published weekly plague mortality statistics in
    a broadside series known as the Bills of Mortality. The bills grew to include
    not just plague deaths but also dozens of other causes of death, ensuring their
    continued publication for decades after the final outbreak of plague in England.
