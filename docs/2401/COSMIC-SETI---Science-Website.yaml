    (COSMIC) system is a newly developed digital signal processing instrument deployed
    at the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA), which is designed to enable Search
    for Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence (SETI) observations to be conducted at the
    VLA in parallel with "Primary User" PI-led Science observations. The COSMIC system
    capabilities are still under active development.

    in order to highlight opportunities where PIs might be able to leverage the power
    of the COSMIC  system for their own observations, and also to provide insight
    as to where conflicts may exist between PI-led science and COSMIC.

    times receives a copy of digitized data streams from each of the VLA’s antennas.
    The data received by COSMIC necessarily reflects antenna-pointing, LO-tuning and
    digitization settings commanded by VLA observers, but otherwise operates completely independently.
    In particular, COSMIC is unaffected by any of the interferometric phasing, channelization,
    or correlation processes of the VLA’s facility instrument: WIDAR.'

    full observing bandwidth of the VLA. However, for the duration of 2023, we expect
    the COSMIC GPU cluster to be able to process no more than 2 GHz of bandwidth from
    each of the VLA antennas. Over time, the cluster will be built out to handle the

- en: The COSMIC FPGA subsystem receives custom-format digitized data streams from
    the VLA antennas. As defined by the telescope’s primary observer, these data streams
    comprise multiple IF tunings, each with either 1 GHz, or 2 GHz of bandwidth. The
    first stage of FPGA processing filters the incoming data streams into multiple
    1 MHz channels, and applies delay and phase tracking to these channelized data
    streams to track a phase center (currently assumed to invariably be the pointing-direction
    of the array’s antennas). Channelized, “fringe-stopped” data streams are then
    transmitted from the FPGAs over a collection of 100 Gb/s Ethernet ports as a series
    of UDP/IP packets. COSMIC may be dynamically configured to transmit all, or a
    subset, of 1 MHz channels. Data may also be dynamically steered to different CPU/GPU
    servers for processing, using standard Ethernet packet switching, or IP routing.
