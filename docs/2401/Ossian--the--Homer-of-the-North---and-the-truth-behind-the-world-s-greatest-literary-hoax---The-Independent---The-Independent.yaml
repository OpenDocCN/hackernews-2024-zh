- en: For decades, high society couldn’t get enough of the epic poetry of the blind
    3rd century Scottish bard, Ossian, dubbed the ‘Homer of the North’, and his tales
    of the great warrior Fingal after it was ‘discovered’ by his ‘translator’ James
    Macpherson in the mid–1700s.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But doubts soon emerged. Could it be that Macpherson, also a poet, had adapted
    Irish folklore to create Scottish legends that would be taken seriously by a British
    elite obsessed by Classical Greece and Rome? Literary giant Samuel Johnson certainly
    thought so, condemning the “forgeries” and the “mountebank” behind them.

    “social networks” of characters in Ossian with those in two key Irish stories
    – and discovered they are almost a perfect match, virtually ending any remaining
    debate.
