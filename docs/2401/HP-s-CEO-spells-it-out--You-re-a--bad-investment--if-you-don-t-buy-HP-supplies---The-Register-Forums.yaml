    incredible printer deals.

    consumer manufacturers money, the deals were still fairly good.

    crazy idea of subscription purchases and clearly want to lock down printers even
    more.

    get third party inks for it, keep that sucker running as long as you can.

    and doing a firmware reset with a code - it cost me £10.

- en: The firmware reset "tells" the printer that the overflow tank is empty - without
    that reset, no amount of cleaning the tank and replacing the sponges will work.

    old now.

    I'll be able to keep it ticking over until you can no longer get the catridges.

    now - so I have NO idea what my wife will use when the Epson she has finally bites
    the dust...
