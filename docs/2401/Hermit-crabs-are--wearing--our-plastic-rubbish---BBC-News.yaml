    Marta Szulkin, an urban ecologist from the University of Warsaw, explained: "We

    I think we really need to understand the fact that we are living in a different
    era and animals are making use of what is available to them."'

    crustaceans interact with and use plastic. As well as understanding whether it
    causes them any harm, the scientists want to work out how it might affect their
    evolution.

    to protect their fragile bodies. And when those shells are in short supply, the
    crabs will fight over them.

    it might be becoming easier for the animals to find an artificial alternative.
    And lighter, plastic 'shells' might even help smaller, weaker crabs to survive
    because they are easier to carry.

    animals to choose from. [A recent study](/news/science-environment-64889284) that
    attempted to quantify the scale of plastic pollution estimated that at least 171
    trillion pieces of plastic are now floating in our oceans.

    London told the BBC that there was a lesson for humans in these images. "Just
    like the hermit crabs," he said, "we should be reusing plastics much more, instead
    of discarding it."
