    sending shock waves through an embattled audio industry still reeling from the
    end of the COVID-era production bubble.

    platform had begun switching off automatic downloads for users who haven’t listened
    to five episodes of a show in the last two weeks.'

- en: 'But while few users noticed the shift, some of the biggest podcasts in the
    world saw their official listener numbers drop dramatically. Long-running shows
    that publish frequently were hit particularly hard. A user who listened to a show
    like The New York Times’ *The Daily* a few times, subscribed, but stopped listening
    would continue to count as a download indefinitely. Even better under the old
    rules: For people who listened to a show, dropped off for a while, but started
    listening again later, Apple would automatically download every show in between.
    The arrangement drove big download numbers, a crucial metric for ad sales and
    a sign of the vast reach of podcasts as a medium.'

    *a billion total downloads*. But representatives for these shows would not say
    if those numbers or other impressive daily or weekly download stats are still
    accurate, though several of the biggest podcasts acknowledged privately to Semafor
    that they had seen noticeable declines, and were still trying to determine the
    actual size of their audience following the change.

    York Times, NPR, and other major publishers told Semafor they were surprised by
    the September change, which had been years in the making but came with no advanced
    warning from Apple. One podcast network told Semafor it had seen its downloads
    drop between single digits and low double digits depending on the show. Another
    well-known podcaster and executive said for some shows, the decline in downloads
    was as high as 40%.
