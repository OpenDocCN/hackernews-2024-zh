- en: Chris Dixon, who leads the [A16Z crypto fund](https://a16zcrypto.com/), and
    has been an entrepreneur, VC, and friend of mine for over twenty years, has written
    a book called [Read Write Own](https://readwriteown.com/) that is available for
    pre-order now and will start shipping at the end of the month. Chris gave me a
    copy right before the holidays and I read it over the last week.

- en: I asked Chris why he wrote the book and he had two answers, one personal and
    one practical. The personal one is “I have focused my career on investing in blockchain
    networks. During the recent downturn, I felt a need to rearticulate to myself
    why I am doing that.”  The practical one is “I want to explain blockchain networks
    to young adults who are thinking about where to start their careers, to the mother
    of the software engineer at Coinbase who wants to understand what her child is
    working on, and to lawmakers and regulators in DC who need to understand why they
    are important.”

- en: What Chris calls Blockchain Networks, I call Web3\. The term Web3 is important
    to me because my investing career first took meaning during the initial phase
    of the web, which I think of as Web1\. It took off during the second phase of
    my career which many call Web2\. And I’ve spent the last decade of my career imagining
    what a better version could be, which I call Web3.

    The initial phase of the web, when the web browser arrived, was mostly a reading
    experience. Then in the early 2000s, the web became two-way and we could Read
    and Write. What Blockchain Networks have unlocked is the ability to own things
    on the web. You can own your identity. You can own your social media posts. You
    can own your money. You can own your art. You can own your music. And so on and
    so forth.

- en: Chris’s book has three parts. The first part is a history of the web and how
    we got to where we are right now. The second part is a detailed description of
    what makes Blockchain Networks work and why they are important and powerful. The
    third and final part is a series of descriptions of new kinds of applications
    that are being built on Blockchain Networks.

- en: While I enjoyed all three parts of the book, I was energized by the final section.
    Chris imagines a future that is very different from where we are today. It is
    one I very much want to see emerge. I think you will too.

- en: You can pre-order Read Write Own [here](https://readwriteown.com/).I encourage
    you to do that. I expect you will turn that last page and be excited, like I am,
    about what is coming now that we can own the Internet instead of it owning us.
