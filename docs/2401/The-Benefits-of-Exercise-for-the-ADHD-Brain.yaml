- en: If you were to run into Jackson, my former patient, you would meet a compact
    21-year-old in jeans and an untucked shirt, who speaks articulately about his
    plans for the future — a typical American college kid, if not a little smarter.
    What stands out about him isn’t so much where he is today, but how far he has
    come to get here and how he did it with an alternative ADHD treatment.

- en: Jackson, who has attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ([ADHD or ADD](https://www.additudemag.com/add-adhd-symptoms-difference/)),
    runs nearly every day — three miles on days that he also does resistance training,
    six miles on the others. “If I don’t do it, it’s not like I feel guilty,” he says.
    “I feel like I’ve missed something in my day, and I want to go do it. Because
    I figured out that, while I’m exercising, I don’t have trouble concentrating on
    anything.”

- en: Jackson was diagnosed with [ADHD](https://www.additudemag.com/what-is-adhd-symptoms-causes-treatments/)
    early on, after his third-grade teacher picked up on his disruptive behavior and
    inability to complete class work. He began taking [Ritalin](https://www.additudemag.com/medication/ritalin/)
    and stayed on some form of stimulant throughout his school years.

    he could get through. At one point, I had him taking Adderall, Paxil, and clonazepam,
    a long-acting anxiety drug.

    hoped to attend, despite family connections. A small junior college accepted him,
    though, and that was just fine. The triumph of completing school, along with the
    comfort of having a destination the next fall, put him on top of the world. In
    fact, he felt so good that summer that he decided to go off his medication-all
    of it. (Needless to say, I wasn’t in the loop at the time.) “I noticed that a
    lot of small things that bothered me went away,” he reports.

    Walking around shirtless on the beach, with all the “Spanish dudes,” he was inspired
    to do something about his Buddha belly. “I just started to run,” he says. “And
    I started feeling great.”

    for his body image but stuck with it for the therapeutic effect. At first, the
    running didn’t make a dent in his physique (thanks to pizza and beer), but he
    stuck with it because it helped him focus. In his first semester at the junior
    college, he earned a 3.9 GPA, and, after a year, he was accepted as a transfer
    student at the college he had originally wanted to attend.

- en: Jackson is clearly tuned in to his own state of mind. If he falls off his exercise
    regimen, his concentration wavers. He knows how it makes him feel, and that knowledge
    itself keeps him going. “When I started exercising, I suddenly was able to concentrate
    on things that were important to me,” he says. “There’s never been any question
    in my mind that exercise is related to concentration. Once I made this huge life
    change, and committed to exercise, it was very clear to me that things started
    to change in my life.”

- en: Not everyone with ADHD will experience the sweeping effect of exercise that
    Jackson did. And I would have never suggested he abruptly quit taking his medication,
    especially the antidepressant. His experience begs the question of whether exercise
    can replace Ritalin or Adderall or Wellbutrin, and, for the vast majority of cases,
    I would say the answer is no. At least not in the way James Blumenthal, Ph.D.,
    and his colleagues at Duke University showed that exercise can stand in for Zoloft
    in treating those with a mood disorder.

- en: Yet there is something instructive in Jackson’s motivation for discontinuing
    his medication. I think he felt out of control, knowing that he was smart enough
    to succeed but unable to make it happen. Constant frustration can lead to feelings
    of demoralization, and, in Jackson’s case, this fed his mood disorder. For him,
    taking medication created a sense of dependency, exacerbating those feelings.
    Conversely, getting into a running routine provided a sense of control over his
    inner self-his mood, his anxiety, his focus. For the first time in his life, he
    felt like he could steer his own future. He used running as his medicine.

    dopamine and norepinephrine-both of which play leading roles in regulating the
    attention system. With regular physical activity, we can raise the baseline levels
    of dopamine and norepinephrine by spurring the growth of new receptors in certain
    brain areas.
  prefs: []

- en: Exercise also helps balance norepinephrine in the brain stem’s arousal center.
    “Chronic exercise improves the tone of the locus coeruleus,” says Amelia Russo-Neustadt,
    M.D., Ph.D., a neuroscientist and psychiatrist at California State University.
    “The result is that we are less prone to startle or to react out of proportion
    to any given situation. We also feel less irritable.”

    basal ganglia, which is responsible for the smooth shifting of the attention system.
    This area is the key binding site for stimulants, and brain scans show it to be
    abnormal in children with ADHD.

- en: One group of researchers, including the [University of Georgia’s](https://www.uga.edu/)
    Rodney Dishman, Ph.D., examined the effects of exercise in ADHD kids by using
    motor-function tests that provide indirect measures of dopamine activity. The
    results threw Dishman for a loop because boys and girls responded differently.
    In boys, rigorous exercise improved their ability to stare straight ahead and
    stick out their tongue, for example, indicating better motor reflex inhibition.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Girls didn’t show this improvement, which may be because of a lower incidence
    of hyperactivity in girls. Both boys and girls improved by another measure related
    to the sensitivity of dopamine synapses, although boys fared better after maximal
    (vigorous) exercise and girls after submaximal (moderate) exercise.

    for instance, contributes to fidgetiness in ADHD kids, and recent studies have
    shown that [ADHD medications](https://www.additudemag.com/adhd-medication-for-adults-and-children/)
    that elevate dopamine and norepinephrine bring this area back in balance. When
    it comes to elevating norepinephrine levels, the more complex the exercise, the
    better. Rats haven’t learned to do judo in the lab-at least not yet-but scientists
    have looked at neurochemical changes in their brains after periods of acrobatic
    exercise, the closest parallel to martial arts for rats. Compared to rats who
    ran on a treadmill, their cohorts who practiced complex motor skills improved
    levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) more dramatically, which suggests
    growth in the cerebellum.

    biking, whitewater paddling, and-sorry to tell you, Mom-skateboarding are especially
    good for adults and children with ADHD. Why, exactly? The technical movement inherent
    in these types of sports activate a vast array of brain areas that control balance,
    timing, sequencing, evaluating consequences, switching, error correction, fine
    motor adjustments, inhibition, and, of course, intense focus and concentration.

    a karate chop, or breaking your neck on the balance beam, or drowning in a swirling
    pool of whitewater-and, thus, taps into the focusing power of the fight-or-flight
    response. When the mind is on high alert, there is plenty of motivation to learn
    the skills necessary for these activities. As far as the brain is concerned, it’s
    do or die. And, of course, we will be in the aerobic range most of the time we’re
    involved in these activities, which boosts our cognitive abilities and makes it
    easier to absorb new moves and strategies.

    the amygdala. In the context of ADHD, the amygdala blunts the hair-trigger responsiveness
    a lot of people experience, and evens out the reaction to a new source of stimulus,
    so we don’t go overboard and scream at another driver in a fit of road rage, for
    example.

    of the prefrontal cortex is critical. The seminal 2006 study, from Arthur Kramer,
    Ph.D., of the University of Illinois, used MRI scans to show that walking as few
    as three days a week for six months increased the volume of the prefrontal cortex
    in older adults.

    improvement in working memory, smoothly switching between tasks and screening
    out irrelevant stimuli. Kramer wasn’t on the trail of ADHD, but his findings illustrate
    another way exercise might help.

- en: Everyone agrees that exercise boosts levels of dopamine and norepinephrine.
    One of the intracellular effects of these neurotransmitters, according to [Yale
    University](https://www.yale.edu/) neurobiologist Amy Arnsten, Ph.D., is to improve
    the prefrontal cortex’s signal-to-noise ratio. Arnsten has found that norepinephrine
    improves the signal quality of synaptic transmission, while dopamine decreases
    the noise, or static, of undirected neuron chatter. This prevents the receiving
    cell from processing irrelevant signals.
  prefs: []

- en: Arnsten also suggests that neurotransmitter levels follow an upside-down U pattern,
    meaning that increasing them helps to a point, after which there’s a negative
    effect. As with every other part of the brain, the neurological soup needs to
    stay at optimum levels. Exercise is the best recipe.

    symptoms, along with their medication. The best strategy is to exercise in the
    morning, and take the medication about an hour later, when the immediate focusing
    effects of exercise begin to wear off. For a number of patients, I find that,
    if they exercise daily, they need a lower dose of stimulant.

    affords and to set the right tone for the day. A lot of times, that keeps me going.
    Researchers haven’t quantified how long the spike in dopamine and norepinephrine
    lasts after an exercise session, but anecdotal evidence suggests an hour, or maybe
    90 minutes, of calm and clarity. I tell people who need medication to take it
    at the point when the effects of exercise are wearing off, to get the most benefit
    from both approaches.

    should experiment to see what regimen works. My hope is that knowing how it works
    will allow one to find the best solution for himself. I would say 30 minutes of
    aerobic exercise a day should be the minimum. It’s not a lot of time, especially
    considering that it will help one focus enough to make the most of the rest of
    their day.
