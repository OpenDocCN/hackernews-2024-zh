- en: So successful harnessing of surplus heat from sewage is not just about technology,
    as Silveira explains. There has to be buy-in at government-level. "Political organisation
    and regulations influence which direction the decision makers choose to go, and
    political will depends on what they perceive as possible." She explains that in
    Sweden, centralised solutions like district heating have worked well because municipalities
    have the power to make these kinds of long-term decisions.

    where local councils don't have as much sway, or where urban areas aren't yet
    set up for district heating, sewage heat can still be repurposed and used to operate
    water treatment plants and provide clean water and sanitation. "If water treatment
    plants can use that energy internally, that's a big thing that most cities can
    do," says Silveira. Already, wastewater heat recovery [projects are underway](https://openresearch.lsbu.ac.uk/download/81f38f97a426eec9d4235148e16cdcd9d11f7f3f2161f25779c1eb9665bb9d3b/1225478/The%2520potential%2520of%2520the%2520heat%2520recovery%2520from%2520urban%2520sewage%2520wastewater%2520for%2520use%2520in%2520residential%2520and%2520commercial%2520buildings.pdf)

- en: Back in False Creek, there are tangible benefits for residents. Noisy heat pumps
    and boiler equipment operate within the energy centre, so rooftops of residential
    buildings that would otherwise have been home to heating infrastructure are being
    repurposed as communal gardens and green roofs. Maintenance is centralised, carried
    out by professionals and paid for by the neighbourhood energy unit – plus customers
    are protected from fuel price volatility, Pope says. "By connecting to a system
    that operates at a very high efficiency, you're sheltered from price swings in
    gas or electricity."

- en: Pope hopes that False Creek will inspire other municipalities to decarbonise
    their thermal grids. "The local emission reductions that we're realising are great
    but where we can really amplify the effect of what the city is doing is by sharing
    what's worked and what hasn't, then help others make confident investments in
    low carbon energy."
