    have been cutting down on content spend, Netflix is prepared to invest in a larger
    slate. However, it won't be doing that through acquisitions of traditional entertainment
    companies or linear assets, the company said in a letter to shareholders Tuesday.

    consolidation, particularly among companies with large and declining linear networks,"
    the company said. "We''re not interested in acquiring linear assets. Nor do we

    change the competitive environment given all the consolidation that has already
