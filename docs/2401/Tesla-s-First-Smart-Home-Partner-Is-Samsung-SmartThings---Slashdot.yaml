    Watch" feature so that you''re notified of heavy weather on a Samsung phone or
    TV, for example. In addition to the Powerwall, SmartThings Energy will be able
    to connect to other Tesla products, including its electric vehicles, Solar Inverter,
    and Wall Connector charging solutions. The collaboration is possible thanks to
    [Tesla''s API](https://tech.slashdot.org/story/23/10/13/2047226/tesla-releases-official-api-documentation-to-support-third-party-apps),
    which Samsung claims SmartThings Energy is the first to take advantage of.*'
