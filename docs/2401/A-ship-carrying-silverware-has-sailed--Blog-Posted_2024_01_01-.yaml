    frustrating process. While the oft-repeated claim that D is a closed-source language
    is not really true (the D-specific parts of the compiler were GPL'd as early as
    2002, leading to an all-GPL compiler (what we now know as gdc) being released
    in 2004), it is true that D's development methodologies are not especially open
    and that decision making has very little meaningful input from the community,
    and this has been true for its entire history.

    might first look at that, and say "this is where the planes tend to be shot, let's
    armor that", but the actual result was the opposite. These were the planes that
    made it back, meaning the ones shot elsewhere probably went down. Thus it was

    patches that have been left to rot. The code we know know as "druntime" originated
    as a fork because Walter failed to accept community contributions. In 2004, after
    attempting to work with upstream, these developers were left with no option but
    to fork the language to keep their contributions - which they must have felt were
    necessary to expand the use of D - from being totally lost. This fork was called
    "Ares" at first, and would later join forces with other community efforts to become
    "Tango".

    now about D, the name was obvious: Tango was where the developers actually were
    welcome to contribute. And contribute they did: the Tango ecosystem had many things
    the Phobos ecosystem lacked.'
