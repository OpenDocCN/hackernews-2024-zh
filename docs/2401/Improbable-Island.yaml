- en: Improbable Island is an old-school text adventure that's been on the internet
    and under constant development since dial-up days. When something's been kept
    alive for that long, it can either be a polished masterpiece with nothing unnecessary
    added, or it can be a huge, sprawling clattering kaleidoscope of interlocking
    cogs and gears that leaps out at unsuspecting newbies and swallows them whole
    into its oily, confusing mess. Guess which way we went.

    don't understand a fucking word of it then consider yourself lucky. This shit
    is absolutely labyrithine and it'll suck you in and grind your brain into a fine
    paste. One day you'll try to explain it to someone and ten minutes in they'll
    just get up and leave.

- en: Dull but weirdly comforting at first, but scratch the surface and you'll find
    impenetrable and frustrating layers of interlocking complexity that will make
    "dull but weirdly comforting" seem like heaven itself. A hacked-together collection
    of gameplay styles from retro to ultramodern, each interacting with the other
    in increasingly unlikely ways, assembled over the course of decades by a professional
    sadist.

    drag-and-drop programming. Some Places are more complex and fascinating than anything
    the actual game programmer could come up with, others are absolutely horrendous,
    some are both. Figuring out which is which is part of the alleged "fun."

    is thousands strong and only a little bit culty. Some of these poor sods have
    been stuck in this dump for ten years or more, writing doorstop-novel's worth
    of plot.

    we've never been quiet since the late 2000's; 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, we
    haven't been empty for even one second in over a decade. That's
