    distracted. You look up again: you''re surrounded by a barren hell-scape, the
    world as you know it has come to an end — you sit alone on a sand dune, the sole
    witness of our sun shrugging off the last of its dying light.'

    for as long as possible. They keep us scrolling, swiping, and crushing candy through
    a mixture of psychological tricks, social pressure, and slot machine style design

    if you're like me, and you've found your life slipping away on certain apps, not
    as a conscious choice, but out of ease and habit — you should **delete or hide
    life-wasting apps.**

    move, but it really isn't. You can always download the app again if you change
    your mind — your account will still be there waiting.
