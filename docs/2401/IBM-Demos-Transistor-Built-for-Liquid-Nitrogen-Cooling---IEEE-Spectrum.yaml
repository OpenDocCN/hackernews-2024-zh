- en: Liquid nitrogen boils at just 77 kelvins (-196 °C). Cooling electronics to this
    frigid temperature could boost performance, but today’s transistors aren’t designed
    with cryogenic temperatures in mind. At the 2023 [IEEE International Electron
    Device Meeting](https://www.ieee-iedm.org/) (IEDM) held in San Francisco earlier
    in December, IBM researchers demonstrated the first advanced [CMOS transistor](https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/cmos)
    optimized for liquid-nitrogen cooling.

    split the channel into a stack of thin silicon sheets, which are completely surrounded
    by the gate. “Nanosheet device architecture enables us to fit 50 billion transistors
    in a space roughly the size of a fingernail,” says [Ruqiang Bao](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ruqiang-bao-48b971a),
    a senior researcher at IBM. The transistors are poised to replace current FinFET
    technology, and they are used in IBM’s first 2-nanometer prototype processor.
    Nanosheet technology is the next step in scaling down logic devices; pairing the
    tech with liquid-nitrogen cooling could lead to even better performance.'

    with operating at roughly room temperature conditions of 300 K. Low-temperature
    systems, Bao says, offer two key advantages: less charge carrier scattering and
    lower power. Reducing scattering reduces resistance in the wires and lets electrons
    move through the device more quickly. Combined with lower power, devices can drive
    a higher current at a given voltage.'

- en: Cooling the [transistor](https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/transistor) to 77 K also
    offers greater sensitivity between the device’s “on” and “off” positions, with
    a smaller change in voltage needed to switch from one state to the other. This
    can significantly lower power consumption. Lowering the power supply, in turn,
    could help scale down chip size by reducing the transistor width. However, a transistor’s
    threshold voltage—the voltage needed to create a conducting channel between the
    source and drain, or switch to the “on” position—increases as temperature decreases,
    presenting a key challenge.

- en: It’s difficult to lower the threshold voltage with today’s manufacturing technology,
    so the IBM researchers opted for a new approach integrating two different metal
    gates and dual dipoles. CMOS technologies consist of pairs of *n*-type and *p*-type
    transistors, which are doped with electron donors and acceptors, respectively.
    The researchers engineered their CMOS chips to form dipoles at the interface of
    both the *n*- and *p*-type transistors by adding different metal impurities to
    each. The addition lowers the energy needed to move electrons across the band
    edge, making for more efficient transistors.
