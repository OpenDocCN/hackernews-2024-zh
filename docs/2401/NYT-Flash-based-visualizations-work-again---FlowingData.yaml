- en: In the 2000s, if you wanted to make interactive or animated visualization for
    the web, Flash was the main option. When Flash lost support and fell off the internet,
    a solid decade of great visualization no longer worked.

- en: The New York Times has resurrected their archives with a Flash emulator. So
    pieces that were relegated to static thumbnail images are back. See the [box office
    streamgraph](https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/interactive/2008/02/23/movies/20080223_REVENUE_GRAPHIC.html)
    that once upset many, the [multi-line chart](https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/interactive/2009/11/06/business/economy/unemployment-lines.html)
    showing jobless rates for people like you, and the [interactive stacked area chart](https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/interactive/2009/07/31/business/20080801-metrics-graphic.html)
    on how people spend their day.

    the open source [Ruffle](https://ruffle.rs) as their Flash emulator. I hope other
    news outlets follow. It’s great to see my favorite visualizations working again.
