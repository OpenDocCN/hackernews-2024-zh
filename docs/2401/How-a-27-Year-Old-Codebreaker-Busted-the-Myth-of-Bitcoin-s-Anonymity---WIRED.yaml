- en: When Meiklejohn started college at Brown in 2004, she discovered cryptography.
    This branch of computer science appealed directly to her puzzle addiction—what
    was an encryption system, after all, but another secret language demanding to
    be deciphered?

  zh: 当 Meiklejohn 在 2004 年开始在布朗大学上大学时，她发现了密码学。这个计算机科学的分支直接吸引了她对谜题的热爱 —— 毕竟，加密系统不就是另一种需要被解密的秘密语言吗？
- en: There was a maxim in cryptography, often referred to as Schneier’s law after
    the cryptographer Bruce Schneier. It asserted that anyone can develop an encryption
    system clever enough that they can’t themselves think of a way to break it. Yet,
    like all the best conundrums and mysteries that had fascinated Meiklejohn since
    childhood, another person with a different way of approaching a cipher could look
    at that “unbreakable” system and see a way to crack it and unspool a whole world
    of decrypted revelations.

  zh: 在密码学中有一个格言，通常被称为 Schneier 定律，源自密码学家布鲁斯·施奈尔。它断言，任何人都可以开发出足够聪明的加密系统，以至于他们自己想不出破解它的方法。然而，像所有自童年以来就吸引着
    Meiklejohn 的最佳谜团和神秘现象一样，另一个采取不同解密方法的人可能会看到那个“不可破解”的系统并找到一种破解它的方法，揭开一整个解密的世界。
- en: 'Studying the science of ciphers, Meiklejohn began to recognize the importance
    of privacy and the need for surveillance-resistant communications. She was not
    quite a cypherpunk: The intellectual appeal of building and breaking codes drove
    her more than any ideological drive to defeat surveillance. But like many cryptographers,
    she nonetheless came to believe in the need for truly unbreakable encryption,
    technologies that could carve out a space for sensitive communications—whether
    dissidents organizing against a repressive government or whistleblowers sharing
    secrets with journalists—where no snoop could reach. She credited her intuitive
    acceptance of that principle to her years as a teenager who kept to herself, trying
    to maintain her own privacy in a Manhattan apartment, with a federal prosecutor
    for a mother.'

  zh: 通过研究密码学，Meiklejohn 开始意识到隐私的重要性以及对抗监视的通信需求。她并不完全是个密码朋克：构建和破解代码的吸引力比任何意识形态驱动都更强。但像许多密码学家一样，她仍然认为确实需要不可破解的加密技术，这种技术可以为敏感通信开辟空间
    —— 无论是反对压制性政府的异见分子，还是与记者分享秘密的告密者 —— 在那里，没有人可以窥探。她将自己对这个原则的直观接受归功于她少年时期在曼哈顿公寓里保持自己隐私的岁月，她的母亲是一位联邦检察官。
- en: Meiklejohn showed real talent as a cryptographer and soon became an undergraduate
    teaching assistant to Anna Lysyanskaya, a brilliant and highly accomplished computer
    scientist. Lysyanskaya had herself studied under the legendary Ron Rivest, whose
    name was represented by the R in the RSA algorithm that formed the basis for most
    modern encryption, used everywhere from web browsers to encrypted email to instant
    messaging protocols. RSA was one of the few fundamental encryption protocols that
    had not succumbed to Schneier’s law in more than 30 years.

  zh: Meiklejohn 表现出了真正的密码学才华，很快成为了计算机科学家 Lysyanskaya 的本科助教。Lysyanskaya 曾在传奇人物 Ron
    Rivest 的指导下学习，他的名字代表着 RSA 算法中的 R，这是大多数现代加密的基础，无处不在，从网页浏览器到加密电子邮件再到即时通讯协议。30 多年来，RSA
    是少数几个没有受到 Schneier 定律影响的基本加密协议之一。
- en: Lysyanskaya was at the time working on a pre-Bitcoin cryptocurrency called eCash,
    first developed in the 1990s by David Chaum, a cryptographer whose groundbreaking
    work on anonymity systems had made possible technologies from VPNs to Tor. After
    finishing her undergraduate degree, Meiklejohn began a master’s degree at Brown
    under Lysyanskaya’s wing, researching methods to make Chaum’s eCash, a truly anonymous
    payment system, more scalable and efficient.

  zh: Lysyanskaya 当时正在研究一种名为 eCash 的比特币之前的加密货币，这是由大卫·朝早在1990年代开发的，朝早是一位密码学家，他的突破性匿名系统工作使得诸如
    VPN 和 Tor 等技术成为可能。在完成本科学位后，Meiklejohn 在 Lysyanskaya 的指导下开始攻读布朗大学的硕士学位，研究方法以使朝早的
    eCash 更具可扩展性和效率，成为一个真正的匿名支付系统。
- en: 'The cryptocurrency scheme they were laboring to optimize was, Meiklejohn admits
    in hindsight, difficult to imagine working in practice. Unlike Bitcoin, it had
    a serious problem: An anonymous spender of eCash could essentially forge a coin
    and pass it off to an unsuspecting recipient. When that recipient deposited the
    coin at a kind of eCash bank, the bank could perform a check that would reveal
    the coin to be a forgery and the fraudster’s anonymity protections could be stripped
    away to reveal the identity of the bad actor. But by then, the fraudster might
    have already run off with their ill-gotten goods.'

  zh: 他们努力优化的加密货币方案，Meiklejohn事后承认，很难想象在实践中起作用。与比特币不同，它存在一个严重的问题：电子现金的匿名支付者基本上可以伪造一枚硬币并将其传递给毫不知情的收款人。当收款人将硬币存入一种电子现金银行时，银行可以进行检查，揭示这枚硬币是伪造的，并且可以剥夺欺诈者的匿名保护以揭示坏人的身份。但到那时，欺诈者可能已经拿着他们非法获得的货物跑掉了。
- en: 'Still, eCash had a unique advantage that made it a fascinating system to work
    on: The anonymity it offered was truly uncrackable. In fact, eCash was based on
    a mathematical technique called zero-knowledge proofs, which could establish the
    validity of a payment without the bank or recipient learning anything else at
    all about the spender or their money. That mathematical sleight of hand meant
    that eCash was provably secure. Schneier’s law did not apply: No amount of cleverness
    or computing power would ever be able to undo its anonymity.'

  zh: 不过，电子现金具有一项独特的优势，使其成为一个令人着迷的系统：它提供的匿名性是真正无法破解的。事实上，电子现金是基于一种称为零知识证明的数学技术的，该技术可以在不让银行或收款人了解付款人或其资金的任何其他信息的情况下证明支付的有效性。这种数学上的戏法意味着电子现金是可以证明安全的。Schneier
    的法则不适用：无论多么聪明或计算能力强大，都永远无法消除其匿名性。
- en: When Meiklejohn first heard about Bitcoin in 2011, she had started her PhD studies
    at UCSD but was spending the summer as a researcher at Microsoft. A friend at
    the University of Washington had mentioned to her that there was a new digital
    payment system that people were using to buy drugs on sites like the Silk Road.
    Meiklejohn had moved on from her eCash studies by then; she was busy with other
    research—systems that would allow people to pay road tolls without revealing their
    personal movements, for instance, and a thermal camera technique that revealed
    PIN codes typed into an ATM by looking for heat remnants on the keypad. So, with
    heads-down focus, she filed Bitcoin’s existence away in her brain, barely considering
    it again for the next year.

  zh: 当 Meiklejohn 在 2011 年第一次听说比特币时，她已经开始在加州大学圣迭戈分校攻读博士学位，但在暑假期间作为微软的一名研究员工作。华盛顿大学的一位朋友曾向她提到，有一种新的数字支付系统被人们用来在丝绸之路等网站上购买毒品。那时，Meiklejohn
    已经不再从事她的电子现金研究了；她忙于其他研究——比如能够让人们支付路费而不暴露个人行动的系统，以及一种利用热摄像头技术来显示 ATM 机键盘上输入的 PIN
    码的技术。所以，她将比特币的存在放在脑海中，专心致志地继续她的工作，接下来的一年几乎没有再考虑它。
- en: Then, one day on a UCSD computer science department group hike in late 2012,
    a young UCSD research scientist named Kirill Levchenko suggested to Meiklejohn
    that perhaps they should start looking into this burgeoning Bitcoin phenomenon.
    Levchenko was fascinated, he explained as they trekked around the jagged landscape
    of the Anza Borrego Desert State Park, by Bitcoin’s unique proof-of-work system.
    That system demanded that anyone who wanted to mine the currency expend enormous
    computing resources performing calculations— essentially a vast, automated puzzle-solving
    competition—whose results were then copied into transactions on the blockchain.
    By then, ambitious bitcoiners were already developing custom mining microprocessors
    just for generating this strange new form of money, and Bitcoin’s ingenious system
    meant that any single bad actor who might want to write a false transaction into
    the blockchain would have to use a collection of computers that possessed more
    computational power than all those many thousands of miners. It was a brilliant
    approach that added up to a secure currency with no central authority.

  zh: 然后，2012年底，一天，UCSD计算机科学系的大部分成员在一次徒步旅行中，年轻的研究科学家基里尔·莱文琴科建议梅克尔约翰开始研究这种蓬勃发展的比特币现象。莱文琴科解释说，当他们在安萨-博雷戈沙漠州立公园的崎岖地形中徒步旅行时，他对比特币独特的工作证明系统深感着迷。这个系统要求任何想要挖矿的人花费巨大的计算资源进行计算-基本上是一个庞大的、自动的、解谜竞赛-其结果然后被复制到区块链上的交易中。那时，雄心勃勃的比特币爱好者们已经开始研发定制的挖矿微处理器，专门用于生成这种新型奇怪的货币，而比特币巧妙的系统意味着，任何一个单个的坏演员如果想要将虚假的交易写入区块链，都必须使用比那些成千上万的矿工拥有更多的计算能力的计算机集合。这是一个聪明的方法，它使得比特币成为了一个没有中央权威的安全货币。
