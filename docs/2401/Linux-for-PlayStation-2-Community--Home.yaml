- en: Well - I'm kind of spinning the project down. There's a couple of reasons.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The main reason is that Firefox 2.0's memory footprint seems to be larger than
    Firefox 1.5\. What this means is that the performance of Firefox 2.0 suffers on
    the PS2 compared to Firefox 1.5.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Unfortunately, the Firefox team has officially halted development on Firefox
    1.5 with build 1.5.0.12, so there won't be any more updates to that build tree.
    I'll continue to build Firefox 2.0 when I get time, but the performance hit may
    make it less desireable than 1.5.
