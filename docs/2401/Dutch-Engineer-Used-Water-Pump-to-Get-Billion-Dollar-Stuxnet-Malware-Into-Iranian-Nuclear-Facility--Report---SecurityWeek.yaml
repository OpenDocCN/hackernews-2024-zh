    whose existence came to light in 2010, is widely believed to be the work of the
    United States and Israel, its goal being to sabotage Iran’s nuclear program by
    compromising industrial control systems (ICS) associated with nuclear centrifuges.
    The malware, which had worm capabilities, is said to have infected hundreds of
    thousands of devices and caused physical damage to hundreds of machines.'

    which involved interviews with dozens of people, found that the AIVD, the general
    intelligence and security service of the Netherlands, the Dutch equivalent of
    the CIA, recruited Erik van Sabben, a then 36-year-old Dutch national working
    at a heavy transport company in Dubai.

- en: Van Sabben was allegedly recruited in 2005 — a couple of years before the Stuxnet
    malware was triggered — after American and Israeli intelligence agencies asked
    their Dutch counterpart for help. However, the Dutch agency reportedly did not
    inform its country’s government and it was not aware of the full extent of the
    operation.

    he was doing business in Iran and was married to an Iranian woman.

- en: According to one of De Volkskrant’s sources, the Stuxnet malware was planted
    on a water pump that the Dutch national installed in the nuclear complex in Natanz,
    which he had infiltrated. The malware would allegedly be able to spread on the
    network once the pump was connected to the system.

    he appeared to have panicked at around the time of the Stuxnet attack.

    to De Volkskrant, but could not confirm whether Stuxnet was indeed delivered via
    water pumps due to it still being classified information.

    and it’s unclear if either or both methods were actually used to deliver the malware.

    the malware’s existence came to light, [noted](https://twitter.com/langnergroup/status/1744389845638635727)
    that “a water pump cannot carry a copy of Stuxnet”.

    investigation is that Hayden reportedly told one of the newspaper’s sources that
    it cost between $1 and $2 billion to develop Stuxnet.
