# Unseen images of code breaking computer that helped win WW2 - BBC News

Despite its huge impact, engineers and codebreakers who had worked on the Colossus programme were sworn to secrecy and the existence of this vital piece of machinery was kept from the history books for almost six decades.

Colossus wasn't formally acknowledged by the UK intelligence services until the 2000's.

After the war eight of the 10 computers were destroyed.

The engineer who designed it, Tommy Flowers, was ordered to hand over all documentation on the machinery to GCHQ.

The attempts to keep it secret were so successful that Bill Marshall, a former GCHQ engineer who worked on Colossus in the 1960s, said he had no idea about its wartime role.

He said he was now "very proud to have been involved with Colossus even in just a small way."

Andrew Herbert, chairman of trustees at the National Museum of Computing, which is based at Bletchley Park, said the release of the images was another opportunity to celebrate the lasting impact Colossus had had.

"From a technical perspective, Colossus was an important precursor of the modern electronic digital computer," he said.

"Many of those who used Colossus at Bletchley Park went on to become important pioneers and leaders of British computing in the decades following the war, often leading the world in their work", he added.
