    building underground caverns to store megatons of hydrogen gas](https://royalsociety.org/topics-policy/projects/low-carbon-energy-programme/large-scale-electricity-storage/),
    it noted that the United Kingdom would need to store 1,000 times as much energy
    in this way as its pumped hydropower reservoirs can hold, and far more than batteries
    can feasibly provide. And the U.K. is fortunate to have hollowed-out underground
    salt deposits in which to put the gas. Others do not. The Pacific coast of the
    United States, for instance, has no appropriate geological formations. They are
    also rare across China, Africa, and South America.

    along with process inventor [Rodney Allam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodney_John_Allam),
    burns natural gas with pure oxygen from a dedicated air separator. The Allam cycle,
    which bears his name, combusts fuel in a circulating stream of carbon dioxide
    that’s heated and compressed to form a pseudoliquid known as a supercritical fluid.
    After the supercritical gas expands to drive a turbine generator, excess carbon
    dioxide created by the combustion reaction is easily bled off. This allows a process
    to capture the carbon without the inefficiencies associated with separating carbon
    dioxide from a regular turbine’s exhaust.

    between €77 and €94 per megawatt-hour delivered. That is well within the range
    that grid operators pay today to balance supply and demand via natural gas-fired
    power plants. Their modeling found that the methanol backup is also 29 to 43 percent
    cheaper than that of alternate grids backed up with hydrogen that must be stored
    in above-ground steel vessels, then converted to power in gas-fired generators.

    is the cheapest option of all—about 14 to 17 percent cheaper than methanol-stored

    now a power systems engineer at [Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory](https://www.llnl.gov/),
    found that U.S. states regularly experience periods of 48 hours or more where
    wind or solar resources fall well below seasonal norms. California, for example,
    experienced two-dozen “solar resource droughts” between 1973 and 2022\. In the
    same period Iowa experienced 158 wind droughts, three of which lasted a full week.

    solution. But he and Wert note that there are other options, as well. One is [building
    long-distance interconnections between regions](https://www.sierraclub.org/sierra/2023-3-fall/feature/us-electricity-transmission-system-gridlock),
    and thus enabling one region experiencing a wind or solar drought to tap another
    region that may have a surplus.

    build. He notes that an advantage for methanol-based energy storage, in particular,
    is that it avoids the need for new infrastructure that covers long distances.
    In fact, says Brown, the ability to put an integrated methanol system anywhere
    could make it the go-to storage option even in some regions that could store hydrogen
    more cheaply underground.

    on Brown’s assessment of the Royal Society’s hydrogen storage plans. “You’d need
    a ton of electricity pylons and cables to bring electricity to the electrolyzers
    at the salt caverns, or a ton of hydrogen pipelines to move the hydrogen around,”
    says Brown.
