> Oh where to start with the AI hype cycle here. RAG integration is great in theory but seems poorly implemented. The big problem with this and other LLM middleware is inserting system instructions that are not documented and can’t be edited: “I'm here to help answer questions and provide information to the best of my ability. My system instructions are to always assist with care, respect, and truth. I will respond with utmost utility while ensuring that the information provided is secure and accurate. I will avoid harmful, unethical, prejudiced, or negative content and instead promote fairness and positivity in all of my responses.” Positivity? Truth? The truth is that’s short-sighted censorship and a fail in my book.
