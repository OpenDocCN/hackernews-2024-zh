- en: Retro Tech Week It may seem that progress in technology proceeds in a linear
    fashion, with new developments replacing older ones. From this viewpoint, newer
    technology will always be better, since it is presumed to have built upon what
    came before it and improved on it.

    doesn't always go in a straight line. Just look at how personal computers largely
    replaced the hulking mainframes and minicomputers that came before them, then
    proceeded to slowly accumulate the advanced features of those older systems, like
    multi-user support, redundancy, and security.

    comments from readers because it certainly wasn't without its faults; its resource-hungriness
    caused the program to be referred to as "Notice Loads" among some users, for example.

- en: However, you could just about run an entire company on Lotus Notes (plus its
    Domino server back-end), and many did just that. The program was a weird combination
    of email, databases, and workflow that allowed companies to stand up custom applications
    and deploy them to relevant groups of workers inside Notes.

    I found it to be incredibly useful in its day. It provided not just your email,
    but an internal telephone directory, contact database, booking system for time
    off, company handbook, and more, all accessible via a single application and a
    single set of credentials, long before single sign-on became a thing.

    via separate web-based applications, each requiring a different login so you need
    to have dozens of different credentials, and each one sporting a different user
    interface. So I guess you could regard the web browser as an app runtime that
    is the ultimate successor to Notes?

    writer had access to in order to support my role as a reviews editor. The magazine
    (remember paper magazines? How quaint!) used to run about 30 pages of product
    reviews in every monthly issue, and we had a database on Notes to help keep track
    of everything.

    be given a serial code and logged in to a storeroom by a member of staff. As reviews
    editor, I would get a notification on Notes that it had arrived, so the reviewer
    could be told it was awaiting their pleasure, and I was able to add it to the
    table of products to appear in the magazine issue currently being worked towards.

    had more money) had a view of the same table, so they knew which products to photograph
    for that issue. This workflow had been built internally, all on Lotus Notes. There
    were many similar applications that others in the company had access to.

- en: Perhaps I have a rose-tinted view of Notes, but I recall it being quite easy
    to manage your emails thanks to a threaded view for email message chains, and
    it seemed a real retrograde step when I later worked for a company that used Outlook
    instead.

- en: However, Notes had started to look somewhat clunky and dated by the turn of
    the millennium, and its considerable user base started to dwindle as corporates
    defected to the combination of Microsoft Exchange Server and Outlook, which were
    perhaps easier to integrate with Microsoft Office applications and Visual Basic
    for Applications when it came to workflows.

    would be discontinuing the Lotus brand altogether, before offloading Notes to
    Indian software outfit [HCL Technologies](https://www.hcl-software.com/) in 2018.

    of the custom workflows built on the platform.

    still being used. The US Defense Contract Management Agency (DCMA), which takes
    care of contracts for the Department of Defense (DoD), is said to have a program
    called Mechanization of Contract Administration Services ([MOCAS](https://fossbytes.com/mocas-worlds-oldest-computer-program/)),
    which was introduced in 1958, making it nearly twice as old. ®
