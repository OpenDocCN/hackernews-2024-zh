- en: Retro Tech Week It may seem that progress in technology proceeds in a linear
    fashion, with new developments replacing older ones. From this viewpoint, newer
    technology will always be better, since it is presumed to have built upon what
    came before it and improved on it.

  zh: 复古技术周 从这个角度看，技术的进步似乎是线性的，新的发展会取代旧的。从这个观点来看，新技术总是更好的，因为它被认为是建立在之前的基础上并对其进行改进了。
- en: Grow older, and you start to realize that this isn't always the case. Progress
    doesn't always go in a straight line. Just look at how personal computers largely
    replaced the hulking mainframes and minicomputers that came before them, then
    proceeded to slowly accumulate the advanced features of those older systems, like
    multi-user support, redundancy, and security.

  zh: 随着年龄的增长，你开始意识到情况并非总是如此。进步并非总是一帆风顺。只需看看个人计算机是如何大规模取代之前的笨重大型机和小型计算机的，然后逐渐积累起了那些老系统的高级功能，比如多用户支持、冗余和安全性。

- en: One of these is Lotus Notes, the mere mention of which is likely to draw derisory
    comments from readers because it certainly wasn't without its faults; its resource-hungriness
    caused the program to be referred to as "Notice Loads" among some users, for example.

  zh: 其中之一就是 Lotus Notes，仅仅提及它可能会引起读者的嘲笑评论，因为它肯定并非没有缺点；例如，它的资源消耗性使得有些用户将该程序称为“Notice
    Loads”。
- en: However, you could just about run an entire company on Lotus Notes (plus its
    Domino server back-end), and many did just that. The program was a weird combination
    of email, databases, and workflow that allowed companies to stand up custom applications
    and deploy them to relevant groups of workers inside Notes.

  zh: 然而，你几乎可以完全依靠 Lotus Notes（加上其 Domino 服务器后端）来运行一家公司，许多公司就是这样做的。该程序是一种奇怪的电子邮件、数据库和工作流程的结合，允许公司建立自定义应用程序并将它们部署到
    Notes 内的相关工作人员群组中。
- en: This writer worked for one publishing company that used Notes extensively, and
    I found it to be incredibly useful in its day. It provided not just your email,
    but an internal telephone directory, contact database, booking system for time
    off, company handbook, and more, all accessible via a single application and a
    single set of credentials, long before single sign-on became a thing.

  zh: 这位作者曾在一家广泛使用 Notes 的出版公司工作过，我发现它在当时非常有用。它不仅提供了你的电子邮件，还有内部电话目录、联系人数据库、休假预订系统、公司手册等等，所有这些都可以通过一个应用程序和一组凭据访问，远在单点登录成为一种事物之前就实现了。
- en: Nowadays, it is common for most if not all of these functions to be delivered
    via separate web-based applications, each requiring a different login so you need
    to have dozens of different credentials, and each one sporting a different user
    interface. So I guess you could regard the web browser as an app runtime that
    is the ultimate successor to Notes?

  zh: 如今，大多数甚至所有这些功能通常通过单独的基于网络的应用程序交付，每个应用程序都需要不同的登录凭据，因此你需要拥有几十个不同的凭据，而且每个应用程序都具有不同的用户界面。所以我猜你可以把网页浏览器看作是对
    Notes 的最终继承者的一种应用程序运行时？
- en: If you wanted some idea of how useful Notes was, consider one of the apps this
    writer had access to in order to support my role as a reviews editor. The magazine
    (remember paper magazines? How quaint!) used to run about 30 pages of product
    reviews in every monthly issue, and we had a database on Notes to help keep track
    of everything.

  zh: 如果你想了解一下 Notes 有多有用，可以考虑一下作者为了支持我担任评论编辑角色而可以访问的某些应用程序之一。这本杂志（还记得纸质杂志吗？多么古老啊！）过去每月的每期都会刊登约
    30 页产品评论，我们有一个 Notes 上的数据库来帮助跟踪所有内容。
- en: Computer kit to be reviewed used to arrive at the publisher's offices and would
    be given a serial code and logged in to a storeroom by a member of staff. As reviews
    editor, I would get a notification on Notes that it had arrived, so the reviewer
    could be told it was awaiting their pleasure, and I was able to add it to the
    table of products to appear in the magazine issue currently being worked towards.

  zh: 待审查的计算机设备过去会送到出版社办公室，并由工作人员获得序列号并登记到一个储藏室中。作为审查编辑，我会在Notes上收到通知，告知设备已经到达，所以审稿人会被告知等待他们的方便，我也能将其添加到目前正在制作的杂志期刊的产品表中。
- en: The publisher's internal photographer (this was the Nineties, when publishers
    had more money) had a view of the same table, so they knew which products to photograph
    for that issue. This workflow had been built internally, all on Lotus Notes. There
    were many similar applications that others in the company had access to.

  zh: 出版社的内部摄影师（这是上个世纪九十年代，当时出版商有更多的钱）有一个相同的表格视图，因此他们知道为该期刊拍摄哪些产品。这个工作流程是内部建立的，完全依赖Lotus
    Notes。公司中的其他人也有许多类似的应用程序。
- en: Perhaps I have a rose-tinted view of Notes, but I recall it being quite easy
    to manage your emails thanks to a threaded view for email message chains, and
    it seemed a real retrograde step when I later worked for a company that used Outlook
    instead.

  zh: 也许我对Notes有些过分理想化的看法，但我记得由于电子邮件消息链的分层视图，管理电子邮件相当容易，当我后来为一家使用Outlook的公司工作时，这似乎是一大退步。
- en: However, Notes had started to look somewhat clunky and dated by the turn of
    the millennium, and its considerable user base started to dwindle as corporates
    defected to the combination of Microsoft Exchange Server and Outlook, which were
    perhaps easier to integrate with Microsoft Office applications and Visual Basic
    for Applications when it came to workflows.

  zh: 不过，到了新千年之交，Notes开始显得有些笨拙和过时，随着企业转向微软Exchange Server和Outlook的组合，其相当庞大的用户群开始减少，也许是因为这些软件在与Microsoft
    Office应用程序和Visual Basic for Applications集成以及工作流程方面更容易。
- en: Eventually, IBM, which had acquired Lotus in 1995, announced in 2012 that it
    would be discontinuing the Lotus brand altogether, before offloading Notes to
    Indian software outfit [HCL Technologies](https://www.hcl-software.com/) in 2018.

    care of contracts for the Department of Defense (DoD), is said to have a program
