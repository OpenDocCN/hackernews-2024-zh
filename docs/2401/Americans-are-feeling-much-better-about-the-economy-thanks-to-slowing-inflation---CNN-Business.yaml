    greatly this month, soaring 13% from December, according to a preliminary reading
    released Friday. Sentiment reached its highest level since July 2021.

    and strengthening income expectations,” Joanne Hsu, the university’s surveys of
    consumers director, said in a release. “Over the last two months, sentiment has
    climbed a cumulative 29%, the largest two-month increase since 1991 as a recession
    ended.”

    which has helped perk up moods among US consumers in recent months. It remains
    to be seen whether inflation could drift all the way to the Federal Reserve’s
    2% target without interest rates staying higher for longer or triggering massive
    job losses.

    rates in the year ahead and over the next five years also improved. That means
    Americans have growing faith that inflation will eventually return to levels they’re
    used to.

    That’s transmitted directly through prices at the pump, which have been falling
    since September, and less directly given wage increases have risen above the rate
    of inflation,” Robert Frick, corporate economist at Navy Federal Credit Union,
    said in a note Friday. “The strong jobs market also heavily influences Americans’
    view of the economy in general.”

    before inflation exploded. Prices aren’t likely to return to pre-pandemic levels,
    absent a deep recession, because even in an immaculate economy, prices would ideally
    rise by at least 2%.

    housing market, persistent income inequality, and rising debt, prompting [some

    and inflation’s slowdown stalling. Some investors have grown optimistic that inflation
    will soon be under control and that the Fed is due to begin cutting interest rates
    as soon as March.

    are still many risks.

    economic activity that seems to have moderated in the fourth quarter of 2023 does
    not play out; that the balance of supply and demand in the labor market, which
    improved over 2023, stops improving or reverses; and that the gains on moderating
    inflation evaporate,” Fed Governor Christopher Waller said Tuesday during a conversation
    hosted by the Brookings Institution.
