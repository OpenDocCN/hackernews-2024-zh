- en: '**AROUND LUNCHTIME ON** April Fool’s Day, 2019, a white transit van pulled
    up on the roadside of Moulsham Hall Lane in Chelmsford. Inside were three men,
    Michael McCool, Simon Peters and Jason Bishop, who had made the journey from Melton
    Mowbray to this spot just beyond the boundary of Chelmsford City Racecourse, ahead
    of a day of horse racing.'

  zh: '**在** 2019年愚人节的午餐时间，一辆白色的中转车停在切尔姆斯福德Moulsham Hall Lane路边。车内有三名男子，迈克尔·麦克尔（Michael
    McCool），西蒙·彼得斯（Simon Peters）和杰森·毕晓普（Jason Bishop），他们从墨尔本搬到了这个位于切尔姆斯福德城市赛马场边界之外的地点，以便于一天的赛马比赛。'
- en: With some time still to go before the first race, the trio unloaded a hard,
    black, plastic case from the van and dashed over to a nearby field. Here, they
    unpacked a DJI Matrice 200 drone and launched it, with Peters at the controls
    sending it flying near to the racecourse. First, they tested the drone, sending
    it 16 metres into the air for 30 seconds, then up again several more times, reaching
    heights of 113m. Bishop kept an eye on the quadcopter from the field below as
    a safety spotter, in case Peters lost sight of it.

  zh: 在第一场比赛开始之前还有一些时间，这三人从货车上卸下一个坚硬的黑色塑料箱，然后跑向附近的一个田野。在这里，他们打开了一台DJI Matrice 200无人机并将其发射，由控制员Peters控制，将其飞行到距离赛马场附近的地方。首先，他们测试了无人机，将其发送到空中16米高处30秒，然后又多次升空，达到了113米的高度。Bishop
    在下面的田野上监视着四轴飞行器，作为安全监视员，以防Peters看不见它。
- en: Meanwhile, in the rear of the van, McCool watched a TV monitor beam live pictures
    from the drone’s on-board camera. He checked that its aerial vantage point offered
    them a view of every twist and turn of the course, before bringing the drone back
    down to the ground. At 1:32pm, the drone took flight again, hovering at 56m. From
    this height, the men watched a horse called Shorter Skirt, with odds of 7/2, [beat](https://www.sportinglife.com/racing/results/2019-04-01/chelmsford-city/518929/bet-toteplacepot-at-totesportcom-fillies-novice-stakes)

  zh: 与此同时，在货车的后部，McCool 观看了一台电视显示器，从无人机的机载摄像头传输实时图像。他检查了它的空中视角，确保他们可以看到赛道的每一个转弯，然后将无人机降落到地面。在下午1点32分，无人机再次起飞，悬停在56米处。从这个高度，这些人观看到一匹名为Shorter
    Skirt的马，赔率为7/2，[击败](https://www.sportinglife.com/racing/results/2019-04-01/chelmsford-city/518929/bet-toteplacepot-at-totesportcom-fillies-novice-stakes)
    开赛时备受瞩目的热门马Fen Breeze。
- en: While following the drone footage from the back of the Ford Transit, the men
    began to place bets online while the races were underway. Using a programme called
    Betfair Betting Assistant, McCool divided his attention between the drone’s video
    stream and the screen of a MacBook Air, onto the bezel of which were written exhortations
    such as “Go were [sic] the jockeys are!”

- en: 'Brian Wakefield, the racecourse’s facilities manager, had been told that something
    strange was happening: a punter at the racecourse who had been laying bets kept
    seeing the odds change in the middle of the race, and suspected that someone,
    somewhere must have an edge. That “would suggest someone was betting off live
    footage,” Wakefield wrote later in a police statement. “I had a hunch this would
    be from a drone or something similar.”'

  zh: 赛马场设施经理布莱恩·韦克菲尔德（Brian Wakefield）被告知发生了一些奇怪的事情：赛马场上的一个下注者看到赔率在比赛进行中不断变化，并怀疑某人在某处可能有优势。韦克菲尔德后来在警方声明中写道：“这表明有人在对现场画面下注。”“我有预感这可能来自一架无人机或类似的东西。”
- en: Wakefield and a colleague set off from the racecourse, driving around the outside
    of the track until they came across the white van. They parked their car and confronted
    the drone operatives; McCool and his band of men kept flying, and the police were
    called.

  zh: 韦克菲尔德和一名同事从赛马场出发，绕着赛道外侧行驶，直到找到那辆白色的中转车。他们停车并与无人机操作员对峙；McCool 和他的人继续飞行，警察被叫来。
- en: Around 2:30pm, the first police officers arrived on scene. Five officers ended
    up visiting the site, including Essex Police’s drone manager. Wakefield told the
    officers he believed the drones were being used to give the people in the van
    an unfair advantage over ordinary bettors, and – according to one police officer’s
    statement at the time – “were filming live horse races and streaming them around
    the world.” (McCool, a fast-talking, stocky former soldier, denies this was the
    case.)

  zh: 大约下午2:30，第一批警察到达现场。总共有五名警察来到现场，包括埃塞克斯警察的无人机经理。韦克菲尔德告诉警察，他认为这些无人机被用来让车里的人比普通投注者占据不公平优势，并且——根据当时一名警官的陈述——“正在拍摄现场赛马比赛并将其实时传输到世界各地。”（麦库尔，一个说话快速，身材魁梧的前士兵，否认发生了这种情况。）
