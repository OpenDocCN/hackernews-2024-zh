- en: '**AROUND LUNCHTIME ON** April Fool’s Day, 2019, a white transit van pulled
    up on the roadside of Moulsham Hall Lane in Chelmsford. Inside were three men,
    Michael McCool, Simon Peters and Jason Bishop, who had made the journey from Melton
    Mowbray to this spot just beyond the boundary of Chelmsford City Racecourse, ahead
    of a day of horse racing.'

    black, plastic case from the van and dashed over to a nearby field. Here, they
    unpacked a DJI Matrice 200 drone and launched it, with Peters at the controls
    sending it flying near to the racecourse. First, they tested the drone, sending
    it 16 metres into the air for 30 seconds, then up again several more times, reaching
    heights of 113m. Bishop kept an eye on the quadcopter from the field below as
    a safety spotter, in case Peters lost sight of it.

    from the drone’s on-board camera. He checked that its aerial vantage point offered
    them a view of every twist and turn of the course, before bringing the drone back
    down to the ground. At 1:32pm, the drone took flight again, hovering at 56m. From
    this height, the men watched a horse called Shorter Skirt, with odds of 7/2, [beat](https://www.sportinglife.com/racing/results/2019-04-01/chelmsford-city/518929/bet-toteplacepot-at-totesportcom-fillies-novice-stakes)
    highly-tipped favourite Fen Breeze in the opening race.

- en: While following the drone footage from the back of the Ford Transit, the men
    began to place bets online while the races were underway. Using a programme called
    Betfair Betting Assistant, McCool divided his attention between the drone’s video
    stream and the screen of a MacBook Air, onto the bezel of which were written exhortations
    such as “Go were [sic] the jockeys are!”

    at Chelmsford City Racecourse had their eyes focused on the skies.

- en: 'Brian Wakefield, the racecourse’s facilities manager, had been told that something
    strange was happening: a punter at the racecourse who had been laying bets kept
    seeing the odds change in the middle of the race, and suspected that someone,
    somewhere must have an edge. That “would suggest someone was betting off live
    footage,” Wakefield wrote later in a police statement. “I had a hunch this would
    be from a drone or something similar.”'

    of the track until they came across the white van. They parked their car and confronted
    the drone operatives; McCool and his band of men kept flying, and the police were
    called.

- en: Around 2:30pm, the first police officers arrived on scene. Five officers ended
    up visiting the site, including Essex Police’s drone manager. Wakefield told the
    officers he believed the drones were being used to give the people in the van
    an unfair advantage over ordinary bettors, and – according to one police officer’s
    statement at the time – “were filming live horse races and streaming them around
    the world.” (McCool, a fast-talking, stocky former soldier, denies this was the
    case.)
