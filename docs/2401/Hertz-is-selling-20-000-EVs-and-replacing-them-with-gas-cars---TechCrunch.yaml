- en: Hertz is selling off a third of its electric vehicle fleet, which is predominantly
    made up of Teslas, and will buy gas cars with some of the money it makes from
    the sales. The company cited lower demand for EVs and higher-than-expected repair
    costs as reasons for the decision.

  zh: 赫兹正在抛售三分之一的电动汽车车队，这些车主要是特斯拉，而将用部分出售所得的钱购买汽油车。该公司将出售电动汽车的需求降低和维修成本高于预期作为决定的原因。
- en: The sell-off began last month and will continue through 2024\. As some electric
    vehicle-focused blogs have noted, they’re being sold at [steep discounts](https://electrek.co/2024/01/10/tesla-model-3-hertz-cheap-used-rental/).
    The company said in [a Thursday morning filing](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/47129/000165785324000010/htz-20240111.htm)
    that it is recognizing “approximately $245 million of incremental net depreciation
    expense related to the sale,” which is a dry way of saying it’s taking a bath
    on the decision. Hertz told shareholders that it believes it will be able to make
    up that loss in the coming years.

  zh: 抛售行动从上个月开始，并将持续到 2024 年。正如一些专注于电动汽车的博客所指出的，它们正以[大幅折扣](https://electrek.co/2024/01/10/tesla-model-3-hertz-cheap-used-rental/)出售。该公司在[周四上午的文件](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/47129/000165785324000010/htz-20240111.htm)中表示，它认识到“大约
    2.45 亿美元的额外净折旧费用与销售相关”，这是一种说法，说明它对这一决定感到非常失望。赫兹告诉股东，它相信在未来几年内能够弥补这一损失。
- en: Hertz’s move to slash its EV fleet comes as electric vehicle sales growth has
    cooled from record highs. The news also follows recent comments from Hertz’s global
    CEO Stephen Scherr about how the rental giant was dealing with [high repair costs](https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/27/23934691/hertz-tesla-uber-ev-plans-damage-repair-price-cuts)
    — in part because many of the Teslas were being used by Uber drivers — and dramatic
    depreciation thanks to Tesla’s drastic price cuts.

  zh: 赫兹削减电动汽车车队的举动是在电动汽车销量增长从创纪录的高点降温之际进行的。这一消息也是在赫兹全球首席执行官斯蒂芬·舒尔最近就如何处理[高维修成本](https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/27/23934691/hertz-tesla-uber-ev-plans-damage-repair-price-cuts)发表的评论之后
    — — 部分原因是许多特斯拉被优步司机使用 — — 以及特斯拉急剧降价导致大幅折旧之后。
- en: Just two years ago, Hertz announced plans to buy 100,000 EVs from Tesla by the
    end of 2022\. The news helped Hertz [distance itself from a chaotic bankruptcy](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2021-05-12/money-stuff-the-hertz-gamblers-were-right)
    and pushed Tesla’s valuation over the $1 trillion mark for the first time. But
    it never happened.

  zh: 仅仅两年前，赫兹宣布计划在 2022 年底之前从特斯拉购买 100,000 辆电动汽车。这一消息帮助赫兹[摆脱了一场混乱的破产](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2021-05-12/money-stuff-the-hertz-gamblers-were-right)，并将特斯拉的估值首次推高至
    1 万亿
- en: Instead, as of October 2023, Hertz had only purchased 35,000 Teslas and its
    entire electric fleet included about 50,000 EVs total. Scherr maintained at the
    time that his company was “committed” to buying 100,000 cars from Tesla, even
    while he admitted that the automaker’s price cuts had shrunk [the value of its
    modest EV fleet](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/10/26/hertz-pulls-back-on-ev-plans-citing-tesla-price-cuts-repair-costs.html).

  zh: 相反，在 2023 年 10 月，赫兹仅购买了 35,000 辆特斯拉，其整个电动汽车车队总共包括约 50,000 辆电动汽车。舒尔当时坚称他的公司“致力于”从特斯拉购买
    100,000 辆汽车，即使他承认汽车制造商的降价已经使[其规模较小的电动汽车车队的价值](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/10/26/hertz-pulls-back-on-ev-plans-citing-tesla-price-cuts-repair-costs.html)缩水。
- en: Hertz didn’t just overpromise with Tesla. It announced plans in 2022 to buy
    up to [175,000 EVs from General Motors](https://newsroom.hertz.com/news-releases/news-release-details/hertz-and-gm-plan-major-ev-expansion),
    and [another 65,000 from Polestar](https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/04/tech/polestar-hertz-purchase/index.html).
    The company did not say Thursday how its decision to sell a third of its EV fleet
    will impact those plans, and didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.

  zh: Hertz 并不仅仅对特斯拉做出了夸大的承诺。它在 2022 年宣布计划从[通用汽车](https://newsroom.hertz.com/news-releases/news-release-details/hertz-and-gm-plan-major-ev-expansion)购买多达
    175,000 辆电动汽车，以及从[Polestar](https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/04/tech/polestar-hertz-purchase/index.html)购买另外
    65,000 辆。该公司周四未透露其出售电动汽车车队三分之一的决定将如何影响这些计划，并且没有立即回应置评请求。
