    designers to spend more time in their own protocols rather than solving over and

- en: The BEEP protocol is a definition based on the experience about well-known practices
    in network protocol design. These practices are found in many frequently used
    network protocols that have been designed over the last 20 years, and are used
    day by day.

- en: BEEP (Block Extensible Exchange Protocol) includes, in one clear definition,
    all the features found spread in those protocols but in a coherent, reusable way,
    that will enable application protocol designers to focus their time on the problem
    to solve.

    allows you to define your application protocol on top of it, reusing several mechanisms
    such as: asynchronous communications, transport layer security, peer authentication,
    channel multiplexing on the same connection, message framing, channel bandwidth
    management, and many more interesting network features.'

- en: However, you are not required to implement your own application protocol on
    top of BEEP. This is because there are many network definitions already done on
    top of BEEP that maybe perform the protocol you are looking for!

    get benefits offered from the framework! You can use the encapsulation format
    that fits better to your needs, including binary formats.

    and then mapped into TCP ([RFC3081](http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3081.txt))
    which makes clear which is the reference to follow.

- en: BEEP only offers you the ability to reuse best-practice network technologies
    that are known to work, without imposing requirements that fall under the user
    application space. You'll still keep your project under control.
  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: BEEP plays well with other defined protocols because it only defines its role
    at the transport layer and nothing else, commonly on top of TCP ([RFC3081](http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3081.txt)),
    allowing to reuse and mix other technologies.
