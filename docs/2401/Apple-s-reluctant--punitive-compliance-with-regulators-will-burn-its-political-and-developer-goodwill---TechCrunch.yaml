- en: Apple does not enjoy this, which should surprise exactly no one. What should
    be a tad more surprising is how willing Apple is to whine and mewl to its customers
    about how much it doesn’t like this, and about how it thinks this will be bad
    for them — the users, who Apple seems to consider its weak-willed wards in some
    regards.

- en: “Across every change, Apple is introducing new safeguards that reduce — but
    don’t eliminate — new risks the DMA poses to EU users,” is text taken from [Apple’s
    own press release](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2024/01/apple-announces-changes-to-ios-safari-and-the-app-store-in-the-european-union/)
    announcing changes it’s making in iOS 17.4 that comply with the newly implemented
    Digital Markets Act in Europe. The release even includes, “For users, the changes
    include new controls and disclosures, and expanded protections to reduce privacy
    and security risks the DMA creates” directly as a second subhead in big, bold

- en: Third-party app install vectors and things like sideloading, which is available
    on Android right now, indeed could pose additional risks for users who are uninformed
    and don’t take proper precautions or responsibility themselves to ensure they
    have good software hygiene and are installing reputable software from trustworthy
    sources. But Apple’s scaremongering is likely overstating the problem, since Android
    as mentioned has exposed users to this risk for quite a while now — and Mac and
    Windows devices have always done the same. Somehow, despite that, society remains
    intact and people are mostly okay with using those platforms with reasonable success.

  zh: 第三方应用程序安装向量以及类似侧载的事物，目前在安卓上可用，确实可能给不知情且没有采取适当预防措施或自行承担责任以确保他们具有良好的软件卫生和从可信任来源安装可信赖软件的用户带来额外风险。但是苹果的危言耸听可能夸大了问题，因为正如之前提到的，安卓已经将用户暴露于这种风险中相当长的一段时间了——而且Mac和Windows设备一直以来也是如此。不知何故，尽管如此，社会仍然完整，人们大多对使用这些平台感到满意且取得了合理的成功。
- en: Earlier this month, Apple also announced that developers would be able to link
    out to the web to tell them about alternative subscription methods for content
    available as digital purchases in-app. There were multiple catches, however, including
    that how and where that link appear are tightly controlled, and Apple has to provide
    special permission to apps to allow them to even do this to begin with. Also,
    the real kicker is that [Apple says anyone who makes a purchase through that link
    owes it a 27% cut](https://techcrunch.com/2024/01/17/apple-allows-devs-to-promote-subscriptions-on-the-web-with-a-27-cut/#:~:text=Image%20Credits%3A%20TechCrunch&text=This%20followed%20the%20U.S.%20Supreme,a%2027%25%20cut%20to%20Apple.),

- en: It’s extremely understandable why Apple doesn’t want to make these changes;
    Apple’s control of the App Store, and its cut of purchases (typically 30%, with
    some exceptions) represents a significant chunk of its service revenue, which
    could have a material impact on earnings if eroded over time. What isn’t so understandable
    is just how petulant the company is being about prying open fingers on its tightly
    closed fist when it comes to compliance here.

  zh: 理解为什么苹果不愿意做出这些改变是非常容易理解的；苹果对App Store的控制，以及其购买切成（通常为30％，有些例外）代表了其服务收入的一个重要部分，如果随着时间的推移而被侵蚀，这可能会对收入产生实质性影响。但是，在遵从此处的规定时，公司的任性行为有多么让人难以理解。
- en: Lawmakers are already looking to poke Apple’s monolithic business in various
    spots to see if it isn’t creeping into antitrust territory — or, as in Europe,
    already enacting laws to limit their control and power. Acting like a kicked puppy
    when it comes to actually putting these things into practice isn’t going to convince
    these regulators of Apple’s arguments that these kinds of measures aren’t needed
    and are in fact user hostile.

  zh: 立法者已经开始在各个方面挑战苹果庞大的业务，看看它是否涉足反垄断领域，或者像在欧洲一样，已经制定法律限制它们的控制和权力。但是，当实际付诸实践时，苹果却像被踢过的小狗一样，这并不能说服监管机构，让他们相信苹果声称这些措施不需要，而且实际上是对用户不友好的论点。
- en: 'At best, it seems short-sighted: Yes, doing so will mean Apple’s revenue picture
    doesn’t materially change in the near-term. But it also means it looks like a
    company supremely unwilling to work with the spirit of lawmaker efforts to increase
    competition and reduce the influence that multi-trillion-dollar companies like
    Apple have on the world overall. And developers are increasingly irate at Apple’s
    antics. Those ill feelings likely won’t mean much for platforms like iOS, which
    have unparalleled install bases and therefore are unavoidable if you’re building
    a mobile consumer software business, but they will mean a lot for any future efforts
    to get emerging platforms off the ground — like the Apple Vision Pro.'

  zh: 最好的情况是，这似乎是目光短浅的：是的，这样做意味着苹果的收入状况在短期内不会发生实质性变化。但这也意味着它看起来像是一个完全不愿意与立法者努力增加竞争并减少像苹果这样的万亿美元公司对整个世界影响力的公司合作的公司。开发人员对苹果的嬉皮笑脸越来越愤怒。对于像iOS这样具有无与伦比的安装基数，因此如果您要构建移动消费者软件业务，则是不可避免的平台，这些不满可能不会有太大的影响，但是对于未来努力推动新兴平台的努力将会产生很大影响——比如苹果视觉专业版。
- en: It also means that Apple could be more susceptible to competitors among its
    core businesses; it may seem impossible at this point that iOS could ever lose
    its power position in the mobile market, but stranger things have happened, and
    developers feeling spurned and insulted enough will be more likely to wan too
    help replicate the iPhone lightning strike for someone else if things get bad
    enough.

  zh: 这也意味着苹果在其核心业务中更容易受到竞争对手的影响；此时似乎不可能iOS会失去在移动市场的主导地位，但是，奇怪的事情已经发生过，如果开发人员感到被拒绝和受到足够侮辱，他们将更有可能希望帮助其他人复制iPhone的闪电打击。
