- en: Using advanced imaging technology, researchers have ascertained the number of
    nanoplastics – bits of plastic smaller than a micrometer – in bottled water, finding
    that, on average, a liter contains 240,000 detectable fragments. The study provides
    invaluable information to address rising concerns about micro- and nanoplastic
    toxicity.

- en: Microplastics – ranging from less than a quarter inch (5 mm) down to a micrometer
    – are formed when plastics break down into progressively smaller bits. And, in
    recent years, concerns have been raised that microplastics are showing up literally
    everywhere on Earth – from the [bottom of oceans](https://newatlas.com/environment/record-microplastics-seafloor/)
    to the [top of mountains](https://newatlas.com/environment/highest-microplastics-top-mt-everest/).

- en: These plastic particles are consumed by humans and other creatures, with research
    now looking into the potentially harmful effects of this consumption. However,
    these studies are predominantly concerned with microplastics. Now, researchers
    from the Columbia Climate School, New York, have used advances in imaging technology
    to investigate the ‘spawn’ of microplastics – nanoplastics, less than a micrometer
    in size – to see how prevalent they are in the bottled water we drink.

- en: The researchers developed a technique called stimulated Raman scattering (SRS)
    microscopy, which involves probing samples with two simultaneous lasers that are
    tuned to make specific molecules resonate. The technique allows micro- and nanoplastic
    analysis at the single-particle level, providing high chemical specificity and
    throughput. Focusing on seven common plastics, the researchers created a data-driven
    algorithm to interpret the results.

- en: Testing three popular brands of bottled water sold in the US (they declined
    to name them), the researchers analyzed them for the plastic particles present
    down to just 100 nanometers in size, which had previously been invisible under
    conventional imaging. They observed 110,000 to 370,000 plastic fragments in each
    liter (33.8 fl oz), 90% of which were nanoplastics. The rest were the larger –
    but still very small – microplastics. They determined which of the seven specific
    plastics they were and charted their shapes, information which could be relevant
    to biomedical research.

- en: Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) was common, which is not unusual as it’s what
    many water bottles are made of. PET probably enters the water when the bottle
    is squeezed, exposed to heat, or when the cap is screwed off and on. However,
    compared to PET, the researchers found higher amounts of polyamide, a type of
    nylon that, ironically, probably comes from plastic filters used to purify the
    water before it’s bottled. The other commonly seen plastics included polystyrene,
    polyvinyl chloride and polymethyl methacrylate, all of which are used in various
    industrial processes.

- en: “Our results confirm the plastic fragmentation beyond the micron level by unambiguously
    detecting nanoplastics in real-life samples,” said the researchers. “Similar to
    many other particle size distributions in the natural world, there are substantially
    more nanoplastics, despite being invisible or unidentified under conventional
    particle imaging techniques, than previously counted large micron ones.”

- en: Somewhat concerningly, the seven plastics tested accounted for only about 10%
    of all the nanoplastics the researchers found in the bottled water. They had no
    idea what the others were and whether they are, in fact, nanoplastics. Assuming
    that they are nanoplastics, the researchers say, means they could number in the
    tens of millions per liter.

    noted growing evidence of ingested microplastics accumulating in mammalian tissues
    and organs and negatively affecting endocrine function, reproduction, gut microbiota,
    and immune responses in rats and mice. The authors of that study concluded that
    it was essential for further studies to be conducted to determine the potential
    hazards posed by micro- and nanoplastics.

- en: The researchers here say that the association between particle shape and chemical
    composition has “profound implications” for toxicological concerns. Studies have
    started to indicate that toxicity induced by micro- and nanoplastics is not only
    dose-dependent, but it is related to the particles’ physical and chemical characteristics
    and their effect on cellular interactions and uptake. They say that single-particle
    imaging data such as that gathered by their research provides indispensable information
    to address the rising concerns relating to toxicity.
