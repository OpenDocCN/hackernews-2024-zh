    a Boeing 737 Max 9 plane in mid-flight, leaving a gaping hole in the plane’s fuselage,
    air travelers everywhere no doubt felt a shudder of horror—even though the aircraft
    was able to turn around and land safely. But in a sense, the startling thing was
    how *un*startling the news was. In the six years since the Max—an updated version
    of the long-running 737, Boeing’s most popular plane—made its debut, the aircraft
    has been plagued by quality problems. The most dramatic of these resulted in two
    catastrophic crashes, in 2018 and in 2019, which together killed 346 people.

    grounded for almost two years. Even after it returned to service, additional issues
    cropped up. Last April, deliveries of the Max 8 version of the plane [were delayed](https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/new-boeing-737-max-supplier-defect-delay-aircraft-deliveries-2023-08-23/)
    because of problems with one of Boeing’s key suppliers’ installation of brackets
    joining the rear of the fuselage to the plane’s tail fin. A few months later,
    Boeing said it [had identified](https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/boeing-spirit-expand-scope-inspection-737-max-quality-problem-air-current-2023-10-12/)
    a new concern, over improperly drilled holes on a bulkhead. Then, in December,
    the Federal Aviation Administration said an overseas airline [had found](https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/airline-news/2023/12/29/faa-boeing-737-max-planes-news-inspected-loose-bolt/72056314007/#:~:text=After%20an%20international%20airline%20discovered,Federal%20Aviation%20Administration%20said%20Thursday.)
    that a bolt on the plane’s rudder-control system was missing a nut—a seemingly
    elementary fault that now chimes with the door-plug incident, which has led to
    the grounding of Max 9s: Both Alaska Airlines and United Airlines said that they
    [subsequently discovered](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/01/08/united-airlines-737-max-9-inspections-turn-up-loose-bolts.html)
    loose bolts in some of their aircraft.'

- en: 'The answer that pretty much everyone arrived at after those two fatal crashes
    was the same: Boeing’s culture had changed. And here, the conventional wisdom
    is correct. For most of its history, Boeing had what you might call an engineering-centric
    culture, with power in the company resting in the hands of engineering and design.
    But in 1997, Boeing [bought](https://qz.com/1776080/how-the-mcdonnell-douglas-boeing-merger-led-to-the-737-max-crisis)
    another aircraft manufacturer, McDonnell Douglas, in what turned out to be a kind
    of reverse acquisition—executives from McDonnell Douglas ended up dominating and
    remaking Boeing. They turned it from a company that was relentlessly focused on
    product to one more focused on profit.'

  zh: 在那两起致命坠机事故之后，几乎所有人得出的答案都是相同的：波音的企业文化已经发生了变化。在这里，普遍的看法是正确的。在其大部分历史中，波音拥有一种可以称之为工程为本的文化，公司的权力掌握在工程和设计方面。但是在1997年，波音[收购](https://qz.com/1776080/how-the-mcdonnell-douglas-boeing-merger-led-to-the-737-max-crisis)了另一家飞机制造商麦克唐纳·道格拉斯，结果成为一种相反的收购——麦克唐纳·道格拉斯的高管最终主导并重塑了波音。他们把它从一个不断专注于产品的公司变成了一个更注重利润的公司。
- en: 'This new orientation was encapsulated by something that Harry Stonecipher,
    who had been CEO of McDonnell Douglas and was CEO of Boeing from 2003 to 2005,
    [said](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/11/how-boeing-lost-its-bearings/602188/):
    “When people say I changed the culture of Boeing, that was the intent, so that
    it’s run like a business rather than a great engineering firm.”'

- en: Corporate culture can be a notoriously squishy topic—too readily subject to
    broad generalizations. And, of course, all big companies are interested in making
    money and boosting their stock price. But even if corporate cultures are hard
    to characterize accurately, they’re still real. As the management theorist Edgar
    Schein [defined it](https://iveybusinessjournal.com/publication/corporate-culture-asset-or-liability/),
    the essence of corporate culture is “the learned, shared, tacit assumptions on
    which people base their daily behavior.” In the old Boeing, the people who dictated
    those assumptions were the engineers. In the post-merger Boeing, the people who
    did so were more likely to be accountants.

  zh: 企业文化可能是一个臭名昭著的模糊主题——很容易受到广泛概括的影响。当然，所有大公司都对赚钱和提高股价感兴趣。但是，即使企业文化很难准确描述，它们仍然是真实存在的。正如管理理论家埃德加·谢恩所[定义的那样](https://iveybusinessjournal.com/publication/corporate-culture-asset-or-liability/)，企业文化的本质是“人们基于其日常行为的学习、共享的、隐含的假设”。在旧的波音公司，决定这些假设的人是工程师。在并购后的波音公司，做出这些假设的人更可能是会计师。
- en: For some businesses, a shift to a greater emphasis on bottom-line considerations
    might not have mattered that much. But manufacturing airliners in large numbers
    is not one of those businesses. That’s because making big aircraft is an unreasonably
    difficult thing to do. A plane like the 737 Max has, by some accounts, more than
    half a million parts. Boeing now outsources much of its production, leaving assembly
    as its main job, so those parts [are made](https://econlife.com/2020/01/the-737-max-supply-chain/)
    by at least 600 suppliers (many of which, in turn, rely on subcontractors). Supervising
    the reliability of the manufacturing and quality-control processes at all of those
    different suppliers, while ensuring the reliability of Boeing’s own assembly processes,
    requires a maniacal attention to detail, a willingness to spend freely on reliability
    and safety, and a culture that tolerates the reporting of mistakes and the investment
    of serious resources in fixing them.

  zh: 对于一些企业来说，更加注重底线考虑的转变可能并不重要。但是，大量制造客机不是其中之一。这是因为制造大型飞机是一件极其困难的事情。据某些说法，像737 Max这样的飞机有超过50万个零部件。波音现在将其大部分生产外包，只留下组装作为主要工作，所以这些零部件由至少600个供应商（其中许多又依赖于分包商）制造。监督所有这些不同供应商的制造和质量控制流程的可靠性，同时确保波音自己的组装流程的可靠性，需要对细节的疯狂关注，愿意在可靠性和安全性上慷慨支出，以及容忍错误报告和投入大量资源来解决问题的文化。
- en: 'That ethos is hard to instill using only financial incentives or the threat
    of firing. What’s really needed is a culture of perfectionism—and that’s what
    Boeing seems to have lost over the past 20 or so years. To take only the most
    obvious example: The two fatal crashes of the 737 Max were the result of a new
    flight-control system that [depended](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/01/12/boeing-max-safety-crashes/)
    on data from a single sensor that had no backup. In both cases, the sensor failed,
    giving the flight-control system the wrong information and precipitating disaster.
    Designing a system that had a single point of failure violated the canon of aviation
    engineering, which has always emphasized the need for redundancy in cases where
    failure would have disastrous consequences. But in the new Boeing, people thought
    the risk was worth taking—or perhaps the new corporate culture they’d absorbed
    had simply stopped making them value what the engineers said.'

  zh: 使用仅仅金钱激励或解雇威胁很难灌输这种理念。真正需要的是一种完美主义的文化——而波音似乎在过去20年左右失去了这种文化。仅举一个最明显的例子：737 Max的两起致命坠机事故是由于一个新的飞行控制系统导致的，该系统依赖于一个没有备用的单个传感器的数据。在两种情况下，传感器失败，使飞行控制系统得到错误的信息，从而引发灾难。设计一个存在单点故障的系统违反了航空工程的规范，后者始终强调在故障可能造成灾难性后果的情况下需要冗余。但在新的波音公司中，人们认为这种风险是值得冒险的——或者也许是他们吸收了新的企业文化后，根本停止了重视工程师的意见。

    suggests that it still has a long way to go. Just as public trust in a brand is
    easier and quicker to lose than to build, restoring a corporate culture that values
    engineering excellence foremost will take more time and effort. And Boeing needs
    to get going, because making airplanes is a business where even a single failure
    can have disastrous consequences for the bottom line—and Airbus, Boeing’s principal
    international rival, [is now selling more aircraft](https://www.wsj.com/business/airlines/airbus-shatters-record-for-jet-orders-as-demand-soars-a9f75750)
    than ever before. Boeing migrated away from an engineering-centric culture in
    order to boost profits and shareholder value. But over the past five years, while
    the S&P 500 index has risen by roughly 80 percent, Boeing’s stock price has fallen
    by about 35 percent; over the past decade, its annual returns have trailed the
    S&P 500 by almost 6 percent a year.

  zh: 那两起空难之后，波音立志要改头换面。这次最新的惨败表明，它仍有很长的路要走。就像公众对一个品牌的信任比建立起来更容易且更快消失一样，恢复一个最看重工程卓越的企业文化将需要更多的时间和精力。而波音需要加快步伐，因为制造飞机是一个即使一次失败也可能对底线造成灾难性后果的生意——而波音的主要国际竞争对手空中客车公司[现在卖出的飞机比以往任何时候都多](https://www.wsj.com/business/airlines/airbus-shatters-record-for-jet-orders-as-demand-soars-a9f75750)。为了提高利润和股东价值，波音放弃了以工程为中心的文化。但在过去五年里，虽然标普500指数上涨了大约80%，波音的股价却下跌了约35%；在过去十年里，其年回报率每年都落后于标普500指数近6%。
