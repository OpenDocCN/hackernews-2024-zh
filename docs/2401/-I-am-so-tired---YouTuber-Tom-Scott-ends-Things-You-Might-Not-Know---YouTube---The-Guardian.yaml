    video about traffic lights on bridleways](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5V45wYwrkY).
    In Britain, we have pelican crossings, toucan crossings and puffin crossings,
    he explained, “and then, because all those are named after flying things, we have
    this: a pegasus crossing. And that is a thing you might not know.”'

    Battersea heliport](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ3g5gPKlDM). And then another,
    [about flammable orange oil](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYxFrMNWbtI). And
    more and more. The cadence settled down to one a week, but the videos kept coming.

    exactly a decade since the first Things You Might Not Know video was published,
    Scott posted his last. “I’ve been throwing stuff at the internet since 1999, and
    for many, many years, that stuff went almost nowhere,” he said on the valedictory
    posting. “I remember thinking so many times during all those years … will any
    of this stuff I’m making ever work? Well, this did.”

    “Creator burnout” is a regularly discussed topic among influencers of all stripes
    – though often behind closed doors, as online celebrities have learned that seemingly
    devoted audiences might be unpleasantly unsympathetic to complaints about the
    grinding schedule of content generation.

    Zoella video to the platform, and in the intervening years all but one of her
    fellow “Brit Crew” generation of YouTubers have slowly dropped off as well.

    subscribers on the platform as well as a popular newsletter and podcast – despite
    which, some readers may be more likely to recognise him from his showing in last
    year’s Christmas University Challenge for York.

    harnessed, underneath a helicopter. I couldn’t find the excuse to do that one.
    But I never missed a week,” he said in the final video. If anything, Scott accelerated
    into the end, filming videos [about the National Grid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F0JDK_71yDg),
    [training boats for cargo ship navigators](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jplrbxI5GN8),
    and a [10-minute examination of every mistake he has ever made on the channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIbfMjZ0ME4).

    “I know I’m incredibly lucky, but a dream job is still a job, and it’s a job that
    keeps getting bigger and more complicated and I am so tired.

    a business, hire full-time employees, and end up as a manager, and that would
    be great for someone who isn’t me. But I know I’m bad at that, and I’d hate every
    second of it. So option two. I could not do that.”

    since he started Things You Might Not Know helped settle his choice. “It feels
    like a lot of people who’ve been making long-form videos have recently announced
    … not retirements but reductions, step-backs. Everyone I know is noticing their
    views slowly falling, and therefore their ad revenue reducing.

- en: “YouTube is this strange aberration in the history of internet platforms. No
    other company decided to share so much of their ad revenue with creators. Whoever
    made that decision, back when the YouTube Partner Programme started in 2007, must
    have been taking a wild bet. I’ve no idea how it happened. And it paid off! The
    result was a whole ‘creator economy’, a brand-new medium that could not have existed
    any other way, and which has allowed artistic creativity that would otherwise
    have been impossible.

    a good idea – even if it is the only option. Between the decline in long-form
    viewers, the threat from junk zero-effort generative AI channels that are only
    going to get better, and the sheer mass of competing video options … I think it’s
    going to be a difficult few years.”

    but Scott doesn’t think the success he found is necessarily harder to achieve
    than it was – or easier.

    option, unless you wanted to get hired by some advertising agency or spotted by
    some talent scout. So while I can’t predict the future, and I’ve been doing this
    so long that I have no idea what it’s like for people starting out today … I’m
    pretty sure passionate people will keep creating stuff anyway.”
