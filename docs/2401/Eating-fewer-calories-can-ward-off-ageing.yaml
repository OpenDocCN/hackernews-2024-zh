    near Tucson, Arizona. They were part of an experiment seeking to discover whether
    a carefully curated selection of plants and animals could develop into a self-sustaining
    ecosystem: a “Biosphere 2” independent of “Biosphere 1”, aka the outside world.'

  zh: 1991年，八名志愿者封闭在亚利桑那州图森市附近的沙漠里一座巨大的温室里。他们是实验的一部分，试图发现是否经过精心筛选的植物和动物能够发展成一个自给自足的生态系统：一个独立于“生物圈1”（即外部世界）的“生物圈2”。
- en: In terms of proving grand ecological truths the Biosphere 2 experiments were
    something of a bust. As an illustration of what can happen when somewhat fringe-y
    science meets extreme wealth they were fascinating. There were fierce fallings-out
    on both sides of the glass. In 1994 Ed Bass, an oil dynast who had paid for the
    facility, threw out the management team and handed the reins to Steve Bannon,
    later a key adviser to Donald Trump. At the same time, though, there was what
    some took to be a breakthrough in the science of human ageing.

  zh: 就证明宏伟的生态真理而言，生物圈2实验有些失败。作为某种边缘科学与极端财富相遇时可能发生的情况的例证，它们是令人着迷的。两边都有激烈的争吵。1994年，为这个设施买单的石油巨头埃德·巴斯赶走了管理团队，并把权力交给了史蒂夫·班农，后来成为唐纳德·特朗普的一名关键顾问。与此同时，有人认为在人类衰老科学方面取得了突破性进展。
