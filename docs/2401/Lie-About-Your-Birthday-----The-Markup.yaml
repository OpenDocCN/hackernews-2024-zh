    (so they can send you something special on your special day!), you shrugged and
    thought, ‚Äúeh, what‚Äôs the harm,‚Äù and handed your data over.

    is personal information that [scammers can use](https://www.fcc.gov/port-out-fraud-targets-your-private-accounts)
    to steal your identity or target you for fraud. Think back: How many times have
    you been asked to verify your date of birth in serious situations, like when recovering
    your login from your bank, or getting your medical information from your doctor
    office?'

- en: I only lie about my birthday when it‚Äôs a company trying to use that data to
    get me to buy more stuff from them. Do not lie about your birthday to your doctor.
    Or your bank. Or when you‚Äôre trying to get your driver‚Äôs license. You get my point.

- en: If you want to receive these promotions at the same time as your birthday, pick
    a fake birthday close to your real one. For example, if my birthday was December
    13, 1989, like Taylor Swift, I could pick the first of the month, December 1,
    1989, as my fake birthday. Or December 25, if I wanted everything to come around
    Christmas. Most companies run their birthday promotions for the entire birthday
    month, so you can still decide to use their promos on your actual birthday.

    to change their birthday multiple times per year and double or triple dip. Pick
    a fake birthday and don‚Äôt change it again.

- en: On a more serious note, a tip for anyone looking to do more to protect their
    privacy is to be generally resistant toward giving out any personal information.
    For example, my dentist doesn‚Äôt need to know my social security number. Even if
    the front desk asks for it on the intake form, I don‚Äôt fill out information I
    don‚Äôt think they need. If you ever see something on a form that you feel hesitant
    to give out, don‚Äôt. Ask why the office or person or company needs that information
    from you. Or just ignore it until you‚Äôre asked for it directly, and then ask them
    why they need it.

    discount code at Midtown Comics, or some free birthday hot pot at 99 Favor Taste.
