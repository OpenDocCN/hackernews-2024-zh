# Ubidrop – Transfer photos, music, video from Android to Mac seamlessly

## Why not transfer files via Google Drive, DropBox or some other cloud storage provider?

Cloud storage providers need to hold a copy of your data in order to have them available to other devices. This alone makes them really appealing targets to hackers, due to the amount of personal information they hold.

Your data also needs to travel from one device, to a far away server and then back to the device you would like to access the file. This, other than more security risk, sounds like an overkill.
