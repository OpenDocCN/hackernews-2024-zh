- en: Google told Semafor the restructuring would help improve Google Assistant as
    it explores integrating newer artificial intelligence technology into its products.
    The company announced in October that it was using its generative AI chatbot Bard
    to [build a new version](https://blog.google/products/assistant/google-assistant-bard-generative-ai/)
    of Google Assistant that “extends beyond voice, understands and adapts to you
    and handles personal tasks in new ways.”
