- en: I’m kind of annoyed at the state of React lately. I still use it regularly,
    and am somewhat friendly with the folks that work on it still, and it’s the first
    library I reach for, but… it’s just gotten too confusing and frustrating.

    I’ve seen it morph and grow and used the frameworks that have popped up to work
    with it, I’ve written dozens of articles and tutorials for it, I was in the React
    18 Working Group and other related groups before that, and before the pandemic,
    I taught React full time. So trust me when I say: **React’s gotten really hard
    to understand.**'

    with the community (both educational content and also transparency about what/how/etc
    things are being built), and it frustrates me.

    It’s frustrating that the core team all spouted “use a framework!” with React
    18 and then most of the vocal ones left their jobs to join [a company that owns
    a large React framework] and [that framework] seems to use Canary releases rather
    than the one that’s stable and out in the world (and it seems like a “cool kid”
    monopoly). It’s frustrating that they took *so long* to write new documentation
    (and the folks writing them weren’t properly supported) that if you look up “React
    documentation” the new docs aren’t even the first result. It’s frustrating that
    there’s [two Reacts](https://overreacted.io/the-two-reacts/) now (not that there
    shouldn’t be, but that it’s not clear/an easily understandable mental model for
    most people). It’s frustrating that diversity efforts [visibly took a backseat](https://twitter.com/rachelnabors/status/1586772024252583936)
    with React leadership and there’s just not as many voices from a variety of different
    people anymore.

    harped on the React team’s communication before and I do think they’ve gotten
    a bit better. And again, I still reach for React when I want to build something
    somewhat complex, I just… wish I were happier about it when I do. I’m optimistic
    for the future. Kind of.
