- en: Just figure out what to install. How to install it. The right version. How to
    pick the right version. How to make it available in your path. What is a path.
    How do I even open the command line. The two and three letter commands. Flags.
    How do flags work. Why are some flags one letter. What does the help page mean.
    Why are there square brackets. How do I use an argument. How do I paste into the
    command line. Why can’t I select text. What’s a terminal. Is it the command line.
    Does my argument need to be in quotes. Can it have a space. How do I do it on
    my phone. How do I do the command line on the server. Does the server have a command
    line. How do I make it happen automatically. How do I use it programmatically.
    How do I do multiple commands at once. Why am I in a text editor mode now. What
    do these symbols mean. Why am I expected to know this.
