    I thought of it while reflecting on why some opportunities make my subconscious
    scream even if they sound good on paper.

    You do a thing and number goes up.

    sure existing products get sold, people know about their features, and buyers
    adopt your tools into their workflows.

  prefs: []

    to the money, and your work directly makes money. Yay!

    ranking employees and creating internally competitive cultures. Joe vs Jane instead
    of Joe and Jane vs the problem.

    umbrella of a product org. Larger companies may have actual research and science
    orgs.

    features that attract new people. Sometimes you dip towards growth and build features
    that improve activation (users going from signup to active use). Or you can dip
    towards research and explore new product lines.

    But the commonality is a focus on long-term results.

    an asset](https://swizec.com/blog/why-engineers-are-worth-so-much/) and provide
    value for years to come. Any shorter experiments are meant as stepping stones.

    build what they're selling and the better the product the better the sales and

    this budget wants ‚Äì¬†cost optimization.

    engineers. The company sees this work as pure cost and wants to minimize.

    companies. Unvalued work that someone will do when they get annoyed enough.
  prefs: []

    time for NFR work (non-functional requirements) is a special treat for engineers.

    and churny. Research is chill and fuzzy. Development is valued and builds over
    time. Maintenance is always on the chopping block.
