    was a blue-UV tube light common to insect light traps (Philips 15w TL-D Actinic,
    see Supplementary Fig. [7](/articles/s41467-024-44785-3#MOESM1)). The second a
    UV LED bulb (TBE Lighting L276, 9w, see Supplementary Fig. [7](/articles/s41467-024-44785-3#MOESM1)).
    Finally, we used a cold white LED light source (QNINE B22-G45 6000k, 6w). These
    lights were chosen to reflect a range of light spectrum that causes light entrapment
    in insects. However, we did not systematically pursue the effects of wavelength
    in this work. None of our light sources were strongly polarised, negating any
    effects of attraction towards polarised light found in some insects^([51](/articles/s41467-024-44785-3#ref-CR51

    insects to light traps fitted with polarizing filters. Ann. Entomol. Soc. Am.

    within laboratory experiments. UV-Tube lights were always hung vertically in the
    centre of the arena. UV and White LED bulbs were placed centrally in the arena
    and either faced upward (bulb up), or downward (bulb down). To create control
    light-environments, we used either broad spectrum HID lamps (2 x Philips CDM-TMW
    Elite 315 W diffused through the tent ceiling) for diurnal species, or a single
    shrouded UV tube shining onto the ceiling to create a low-intensity UV canopy

    Supplementary Data [1](/articles/s41467-024-44785-3#MOESM4)) at Estación Biológica
    Monteverde (EBM) and CIEE, Monteverde Field station, Costa Rica, under permit
    numbers M-P-SINAC-PNI-ACAT-024-2020 and R-SINAC-ACG-PI-016-2022 issued by SINAC
    (National System of Conservation Areas). Data was collected in two separate field
    trips (Jan-Feb 2022 and May 2023). We used a pair of monochrome shutter-synchronised
    Fastec TS3 high-speed cameras mounted on a single tripod cross-arm. Most videos
    were shot at 500 fps, giving a good temporal resolution for flight behaviour.
    These cameras permitted us to film with infrared illumination, which we assumed
    invisible to the insect eyes. Consistent with this assumption, we did not observe
    any insects crashing into, nor interacting with our IR lights (Larsen wide angle
    IR Illuminators; 850 nm). We configured the IR lighting to create high contrast
    for flying insects against the dark night background. While the exact camera orientations
    and distance from the light-source varied from night to night, we invariably centred
    the light source in the field of view of both cameras. In practice, this gave
    us a maximal recording volume of 1.5 m x 2 m x 1.5 m (Width x Depth x Height,
    with height aligning with gravity). To provide stereo calibration, we waved a
    known-sized checkerboard through the overlapping views of both cameras. We could
    then use the inbuilt MATLAB camera calibration app (Computer Vision Toolbox 10.3)
    to both detect the checkerboards in the views of both cameras and estimate both
    the intrinsic (optical centre, focal length, and radial distortion) and extrinsic
    camera parameters (relative camera orientation and translation). Within our field
    recordings, we were unable to identify many insects below order-level with certainty.
    We filmed the lights in several different configurations. **‘No Light’**: The
    cameras were pointed at a region of space in the forest without any illumination
    from UV or visible bulbs or tubes. IR illumination was still provided and minimal
    leakage in the red was present (Supplementary Fig. [7](/articles/s41467-024-44785-3#MOESM1)).
    ‘**UV Tube’****:** The UV tube light was suspended vertically from rope between
    two trees ~1.5 m from the ground. Macro UV Tube is the same treatment, but to
    observe insects the cameras were moved closer for a few trials, for the purpose
    of data analysis both treatments have been combined. ‘**UV Bulb Up’**: The UV
    LED bulb mentioned above was affixed to a tripod ~ 1 m from the ground pointing
    upwards. ‘**UV Bulb Down’****:** The same UV LED bulb was suspended ~1.5 m from
    the ground. ‘**White Sheet Above****’:** A white cotton sheet was suspended ~2.5 m
    above the ground and the UV tube was pointed upwards close to the light using
    an extra shielding at its base to prevent non-diffuse downwelling light. **‘Sheet
    Down’:** The white cotton sheet was spread on the forest floor and the UV tube
    was kept close to the ground facing downwards ~0.3 m from the ground. To get a
    better overview of the different insects coming to light and to increase the sampling
    of species, we repeated light attraction to experiments with an additional round
    of fieldwork in 2023 using a known set of 30 insect species, spanning 6 orders
    with a single light condition (UV Bulb Down). Insects were photographed to confirm
    their identity and then were released and filmed with the stereo setup described

    any risk of damaging the insect’s vision. All insects recovered in the behavioural

    in infra-red (850 nm) arrayed around a steel ring (diameter 1.66 m) (Supplementary
    Fig. [2](/articles/s41467-024-44785-3#MOESM1)). This was held on a vertically
    movable metal frame (2.4 × 2.4 m) suspended from the ceiling and both raised and
    lowered by a central winch. We used blackout curtains to prevent stray light (e.g.,
    computer screens) in the laboratory from affecting our results. From this same
    frame hung a white cylindrical tent (diameter 2 m, height 2.4 m) with the cameras
    poking through portholes near the ceiling. The tent was composed of white Joelastic
    fabric (J & C Joel) and the reflectance spectrum from the UV actinic tube light
    can be seen in Supplementary Fig. [7](/articles/s41467-024-44785-3#MOESM1). Lights
    were hung in the middle of the tent 1.5 m above the floor, allowing insects to
    fly freely around them. Flights were either spontaneous, or manually elicited
    by brushing the insect’s abdomen. Multiple flights occurred within the same recording,
    and each recording ran for a maximum of 30 min. During these recordings, the insect
    was free to leave the cameras’ view, and then return. We optimised the motion
    capture recordings to maximise the covered volume and recording length. The covered
    recording volume took the shape of a cylinder 1.6 m in diameter, 1.5 m tall, with
    the light-source at its centre. However, reconstruction depended on consistent
    marker visibility, which varied with distance from the light (and thus from the
    centre of the recording volume). As a result, contiguous stretches of reconstructed
    flight were generally within 0.5 m of the light source. This configuration provided
    a tracking residual ~0.24 mm at 240 fps (Supplementary Fig. [2](/articles/s41467-024-44785-3#MOESM1)).

    did not yield usable trajectories. One major disturbance was the wind. We chose
    filming sites that were sheltered from the wind as suggested by an anemometer,
    and tried to record when the wind speed was under 1 m/s. However, wind speed relative
    to the ground varies widely over both time and space at a scale relevant for the
    recordings. Thus, we could not estimate the true airspeed of the insects with
    high certainty. Smaller insects are likely to be more affected by airflow due
    to their lower mass and slower flight speeds. Even low wind velocities may have
    impacted the flight patterns we observed in the field. In any case, we processed
    all flight trajectories that were resolvable and not visibly impacted by the wind.

    processing pipeline was developed for insects with high IR reflectivity, thus
    insects which reflected less IR were difficult to track. For example, the dorsal
    light response was robustly discernible in clear wing butterflies, however the
    transparent wings made accurate digitisation impossible. Similarly, most of the
    insects visibly present at our light were small (<1 cm body length) yet in our
    data the mean insect size was 29 mm ± 9 mm (estimated via angular size and distance
    from the cameras). This bias towards larger insects was due to IR reflection visibility
    in the recorded footage.

    of field data, their function was as follows: (1) Identify and label the beginnings
    of trajectories (start indexes) in both camera views, obtaining the start frame
    and position of multiple trackable paths within a single set of paired videos.
    (2) Import both videos and the trajectory start indexes. Then build a smoothed
    spline by scrubbing through the video and adding position nodes on the tracked
    insect’s location (every 50–100 frames). Tracking could then be applied by subtracting
    an averaged background frame (obtained from 20 linearly spaced frames throughout
    each video) from each frame along the insect’s track. On each frame, the app created
    a search box around the interpolated spline and searched the binarized subtracted
    image, locating the focal insect by its proximity to the tracking spline. The
    light source, if there was one, was also digitised within this app. (3) Finally,
    the raw position measurement of the insect was triangulated from the tracked insect
    centroids and the recorded calibration for that selection of videos. The nature
    of the tracking meant that high-frequency oscillations were created by the centroid
    focussing on the wings of the tracked insect, these were counteracted by fitting
    a cubic smoothing spline through the obtained track. We used a smoothing constant
    that maintained the course of the insect within the bounds of the oscillations
    created by the wingbeats to avoid over-smoothing. This gave a smooth estimation
    of the position and velocity of the insect during its flight.'

    to other markers. Two quality filters were applied to the tracked data to ensure
    accuracy. (1) If the distance between the markers on either arm of the frame exceeded
    0.4 mm of the median length (10% of the length of the shortest marker arms) or
    (2) the angle between the arms differed by > 5° from the median (~90°), the frame
    was removed from the trajectory. These instances reflected either poor tracking
    or accidental mislabelling.

    marker visibility. Individual trajectories were excised if the marker frame was
    not visible for longer than 0.5 seconds. This kept closely time-linked trajectories
    together despite small gaps but separated different bouts of flight around the
    light. When analysing the data, we used separate flags to distinguish 6 DoF data
    (in which all three markers of the rigid-frame were tracked) from 3 DoF data in
    which only one marker needed to be visible. While we required 6 DoF data to distinguish
    orientation of the insect, we could still use 3 DoF data to demonstrate flight
    speed and the position of the insect around the light. Given that insects would
    frequently settle on the light or walls and occasionally walk around at low speeds,
    we filtered out any data below 0.3 ms^(−1) to avoid including data in which the
    insects were not in flight. To quantify the insect’s body orientation, we used
    a composite of non-additive bank and pitch angles relative to the horizontal plane.
    For pitch angle, we measured the angle between the animal’s long body axis (from
    posterior to anterior) and the global vertical. To quantify bank angle, we calculated
    the magnitude of the angle between the insect’s lateral vector (aligning left
    to right laterally across the animal’s body) and the horizontal plane. It should
    be noted that this methodology reflects around the horizontal plane (maximum bank
    is limited to 90°), meaning that an insect completely inverted upside down would
    score the same as one the correct side up. For our motion-capture recordings,
    this was not of practical relevance, as near-inverted animals would obscure their
    markers from the camera system above.

    the light came from above) or at the bottom (when light came from below). Periodically
    switching between the lights was generally sufficient to elicit flight responses.

    50^(th) frame). We chose this because it allows for sampling at a frequency that

    tilting around a light source, our expected distributions are bimodal (insects
    can travel both clockwise and anticlockwise around the light whilst orbiting).
    To correct for this effect, we used an angle doubling procedure. All velocity
    bearings from the light (0°–360°) were doubled. We then subtracted 360° from any
    doubled angles >360°. This resulted in the bimodal clockwise-anticlockwise orbiting

- en: The aerodynamic drag for flapping insects depends on multiple influences, including
    speed, wing posture, and body orientation amongst other factors. Here, we adopted
    a simplistic quadratic air drag model with a form factor *c*. This constant could
    be determined by setting the terminal velocity achieved by an insect in freefall.
    Varying the terminal velocity of the simulated agents allowed for the characterisation
    of insects of differing sizes.

- en: Where c is a constant reflecting the deceleration due to drag for a given airspeed,
    *g* is gravitational acceleration (scalar), and *v*[*t*] is the insect’s terminal
    velocity (scalar). Within our simulations of the three behavioural motifs, we
    used a constant of 0.80 s^(−1) with a terminal velocity of 3.5 m/s. This value
    was chosen as it kept simulated flight-speeds similar to those measured in our
    motion-capture recordings. During random gain simulations, we set the constant
    between 0.09 s^(−1) and 39.24 s^(−1) (terminal velocity between 10.5 and 0.5 m/s²
    respectively).

    *k*[*2*] = 1 s^(−1), *k*[*3*] = 15 s^(−1), *v*[*t*] = 3.5 ms^(−1). The forward

    were chosen to reflect an insect flying at a relatively low Reynolds number (low
    terminal velocity), rapid aerial mobility (k values giving rapid reactions like
    those measured in insect pursuit flight controllers), and with lift and thrust
    profiles like those observed in our measured data (Supplementary Fig. [3](/articles/s41467-024-44785-3#MOESM1)).'

    corrupted celestial compass. This model used the same structure as our dorsal
    tilting model, but with the light response component of the controller attempting
    to maintain the light at a fixed egocentric direction (rather than over the dorsum).
    This arbitrary direction was set by the initial direction of the line-of-sight
    to the light source, from an egocentric perspective. All other components of the
    simulation were kept the same as previously discussed.
