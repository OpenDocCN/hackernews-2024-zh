- en: I’m phrasing the question like this because the answers you usually get when
    you ask are pretty childish. “Well, Timmy, they come from CHINA and Taiwan. We
    need to INVADE TAIWAN before CHINA does, because it’s where the chips come from.“

  zh: 我之所以这样提问是因为当你询问时通常会得到相当幼稚的答案。“嗯，蒂米，它们来自中国和台湾。在中国之前，我们需要入侵台湾，因为那是芯片的来源。”
- en: Vague, politicized, and childish. You can’t build much of anything talking to
    people who dispense wisdom like that. You have to talk to somebody that can identify
    the correct task (making computer chips) and not separate side interests like
    hobbling China’s military ambitions or creating jobs. Which can all be done without
    making any computer chips at all, Starbucks creates lots of jobs and zero computer
    chips. Most people who just want a job have correctly identified that they are
    more likely to get one by putting on an apron than a bunny suit, much to the lament
    of policymakers trying to stimulate the development of a new semiconductor manufacturing
    industry through lavishing subsidies on a handful of very large corporations to
    work on construction projects for the next 5-10 years.

  zh: 模糊、政治化、幼稚。你不能与那些像分发智慧一样的人交谈来建立什么。你必须与能够识别正确任务（制造电脑芯片）而不是割裂副业，比如削弱中国的军事野心或创造就业机会的人交谈。所有这些都可以在不制造任何电脑芯片的情况下完成，星巴克创造了大量就业机会，但零电脑芯片。大多数只想要一份工作的人已经正确地认识到，他们更有可能通过系上围裙而不是穿上兔子服来得到一份工作，这令试图通过向少数几家大型公司挥霍补贴来从事未来
    5-10 年的建设项目以刺激新的半导体制造业发展的决策者非常惋惜。
- en: During the covid-19 shutdown, I spent a bunch of time researching how to make
    my own PCB’s (printed circuit boards). I didn’t end up carrying out the project,
    because it turns out the most popular ways of doing that require some pretty toxic
    chemicals. But to make the most simple analog circuits, the process seemed to
    be straightforward. There’s a bunch of CAD-like programs you can use to create
    the circuit pattern, and then you trace that pattern onto a copper plate with
    the chemicals. Once you have a power supply to your circuit, electrons do everything
    else.

  zh: 在 covid-19 封锁期间，我花了大量时间研究如何制作自己的 PCB（印刷电路板）。我最终没有进行这个项目，因为发现这样做最流行的方法需要一些相当有毒的化学品。但是，要制作最简单的模拟电路，该过程似乎是直截了当的。有一堆类似
    CAD 的程序可以用来创建电路图案，然后你用化学物质将该图案追踪到铜板上。一旦你的电路有了电源，电子就会完成其他一切。
- en: Of course what I learned later was that most people skip over trying to figure
    out how to use chem lab equipment to manually etch copper plates and just buy
    the finished PCB’s from companies in China that will print 30 PCB’s at a time
    and ship them to you. Once you have a design, you just upload it to one of their
    websites and theoretically, the board you get back should work. Or if not, you
    tweak the design and try again.

  zh: 当然，后来我了解到，大多数人会跳过尝试学习如何使用化学实验室设备手动蚀刻铜板的步骤，而是直接从中国公司购买成品 PCB，它们一次可以打印 30 个 PCB，并将它们寄送给你。一旦你有了设计，你只需将其上传到它们的网站之一，理论上，你收到的板子应该可以工作。或者如果不行，你可以调整设计然后再试一次。
- en: I was surprised to find out by making a trip to Silicon Valley to attend the
    RISC-V Summit and asking a lot of pretty naive and uninformed questions that chip
    manufacturing is just the big kid version of making a PCB for a science fair project.
    To create something customized, you can either start with buying “IP blocks” from
    companies that sell access to designs for circuits they already created, or you
    can develop the equivalent using a hardware definition language (HDL). Then there
    are all kinds of complicated software test suite products to evaluate designs
    and make changes before the final “tapeout” is sent to a fab to be manufactured.

  zh: 我去硅谷参加 RISC-V 峰会并提出了很多相当幼稚和不知情的问题后，发现芯片制造只是为科学展项目制作 PCB 的大孩子版本。要创建自定义内容，你可以从销售已创建电路设计的公司购买“IP
    块”，或者使用硬件定义语言（HDL）开发等效物。然后有各种复杂的软件测试套件产品来评估设计并在最终“放样”发送到工厂制造之前进行更改。
- en: That was where things seemed to get a bit hazier than I might have liked. People
    on the crowded trade show floor were eager to talk about open source projects
    to make every aspect of designing a chip easier to do, but trying to talk to anybody
    doing manufacturing felt a little bit like I was an FBI agent sent to try and
    buy drugs from a cartel with a GoPro strapped to my forehead. Suddenly it was
    all whispers. We are NOT CHINA. Definitely, 100%, NOT. CHINA. We do “contracts”
    with “fabricators”. Ok.

  zh: 那似乎比我想象的更模糊一些。人们在拥挤的贸易展会现场急于谈论使芯片设计的每个方面都更容易的开源项目，但试图与任何从事制造的人交谈感觉有点像我是一个被派去试图从贩毒集团购买毒品的FBI特工，额头上绑着一个GoPro摄像头。突然之间就是耳语声。我们不是中国。绝对，100%，不是。中国。我们与“制造商”签“合同”。好的。
- en: But I think this is a thing where greater manufacturing capacity outside of
    China and Taiwan will follow on from opening up the software ecosystem, and not
    the other way around from subsidizing supply of chip fabs first. When all of the
    tooling to develop and test the IP was either very expensive or lacked the transparency
    of open source projects where you can just go on Github and find decent enough
    instructions to get started, there wasn’t sufficient *demand* to have manufacturing
    capacity available locally.

  zh: 但我认为这是一个更大的制造能力将在开放软件生态系统之后而不是从首先补贴芯片制造厂供应的情况下产生的事情。当所有用于开发和测试IP的工具都非常昂贵或者缺乏开源项目的透明度时，你可以轻松地在Github上找到足够好的说明来开始，没有足够的**需求**来在本地提供制造能力。
- en: We need more people who have some independent interest in developing their own
    hardware IP to have a need for additional capacity. The craft beer revolution
    did not come from big companies or the government saying that as a matter of official
    policy, every town should have a couple of breweries. It came from people who
    wanted to know how to make their own beers mastering that skill first. Craft breweries
    only scaled up manufacturing later after there was already demand for the product
    via people trying it.

  zh: 我们需要更多有独立兴趣开发自己硬件IP的人来有需要额外能力。精酿啤酒革命并不是来自大公司或政府说每个城镇应该有几家酿酒厂的官方政策，而是来自想要知道如何酿造自己啤酒的人们首先掌握了这项技能。只有在已经有人尝试并需求产品后，精酿啤酒厂才会在后来扩大生产。
- en: Semiconductor manufacturing hasn’t been like that yet, but there’s a bunch of
    promising concepts that have the potential to introduce that type of dynamic to
    the industry. [ChipFlow](https://www.chipflow.io) was one of the more promising
    ones that I learned about at the RISC-V Summit. It seems to be an adjacent commercial
    concept to the [Amaranth](https://github.com/amaranth-lang/amaranth) open source
    project, which from what I can figure out is a Python-based version of the hardware
    definition languages Verilog and VHDL. There are just so many more people that
    know Python than specialized HDL’s that it can only help to make an open hardware
    ecosystem more accessible. Finally [Libresilicon](https://libresilicon.com) is
    a project that aims to open up the actual manufacturing ecosystem to hobbyists
    and others that have some interest in developing their own customized hardware.

  zh: 半导体制造迄今为止还没有那样，但有一堆有前途的概念有可能将这种类型的动态引入到这个行业中。[ChipFlow](https://www.chipflow.io)是我在RISC-V峰会上了解到的更有前途的项目之一。它似乎是与[Amaranth](https://github.com/amaranth-lang/amaranth)开源项目相邻的商业概念，从我所了解的来看，Amaranth是一个基于Python的硬件定义语言Verilog和VHDL的版本。了解Python的人比专门的HDL更多，这只会有助于使开放硬件生态系统更易于访问。最后，[Libresilicon](https://libresilicon.com)是一个旨在向业余爱好者和其他一些有兴趣开发自己定制硬件的人开放实际制造生态系统的项目。

    something myself and see if I can get it made somewhere.
