    River Styx and reach the land of eternal slumber. Japan’s Ministry of Economy,
    Trade and Industry has [abolished](https://pc.watch.impress.co.jp/docs/news/1562810.html)
    any requirement for applicants to use this ancient clicking and buzzing magnetic
    media when filing official documents. Until last week there were about 1,900 official
    governmental application procedures that stipulated businesses must submit floppies
    or CD-ROMs (specifically) containing supplementary data.

    back in August 2022\. At the time a government minister openly mused “Where can
    you buy floppy disks these days?” He went on to tell reporters that the rules
    stipulating specific media to accompany official form submissions would be changed
    quickly.

    like floppy disks (and CD-ROMs) from Japan’s bureaucracy will surely come as a
    relief to all concerned. [IBM](https://www.tomshardware.com/tag/ibm) shipped the
    first floppy diskettes in 1973 - over 50 years ago. We don’t know when floppy
    disk mechanisms ceased production but [Sony](https://www.tomshardware.com/tag/sony),
    the last floppy media maker, stopped making diskettes over a decade ago.

    procedures that require specific media like floppies and CDs to be submitted,
    or it could push ahead with immediate changes – it isn’t clear from the source.
    However, in 2022 we noted that there is still a viable floppy disk business [operating
    in the USA](https://www.tomshardware.com/news/floppy-disk-still-has-life). This
    singular remaining business supports clientele ranging from the avionics and healthcare
    to embroidery segments – as well as hobbyists and retro computing folk.

- en: Tom Persky, owner of US-based [floppydisk.com](https://www.floppydisk.com/),
    admitted that the end of his floppy business was in sight. In 2022 he said there
    were about four more years left before he thought the floppy disk business would
    dry up. Persky was still receiving about 1,000 disks a day in the mail for recycling.
    At the time of writing, as well as batches of new-old-stock 3.5-inch disks, Persky
    sells 50-packs of tested recycled disks at $19.95\. If the 1.44MB DS/HD floppies
    are too modern for your gear, 720KB DS/DD media is also available (for a premium).
