- en: Intel's next-generation desktop processors codenamed Arrow Lake-S will not increase
    core count compared to existing 14th Generation Core 'Raptor Lake Refresh' processors,
    according to excerpts from an alleged Intel document published by a renowned hardware
    leaker [@YuuKi_AnS](https://twitter.com/yuuki_ans/status/1748640540084912422) (who
    removed the post, but [VideoCardz](https://videocardz.com/newz/leaked-documents-list-intel-arrow-lake-s-with-8p16e-cores-125w-tdp-full-800-series-chipset-details) has
    re-published them). Surprisingly, these documents point to Intel's Hyperthreading
    being absent from the new processors, perhaps confirming long-running rumors.
    This source has an impeccable record with leaked Intel documentation but be aware
    that these specifications could be subject to change as they outline pre-Alpha
    silicon.

    its Arrow Lake-S lineup for desktops (in LGA-1851 form factor) featuring high-performance
    (P) and efficiency (E) cores, including three die configurations: 8P + 16E cores,
    6P + 16E cores, and 6P + 8E cores.'

- en: Assuming that the information is accurate, Intel's next-generation desktop CPUs
    will not increase the core count compared to Raptor Lake Refresh-S CPUs but will
    also come without hyper-threaded P-Cores, a staple with Intel's existing processor
    lineups. There have long been rumors that Intel will move to a new approach with
    its P-Cores that discards hyperthreading, which allows two threads to run on a
    single CPU core, for a new approach that it has [outlined in a patent](https://www.freepatentsonline.com/y2023/0168898.html).
    This listing will surely add fuel to those predictions, but this could merely
    be due to this being extremely early pre-Alpha silicon. It's best to take this
    with a grain of salt; the documents point to the P-Cores being disabled in the
    BIOS due to initialization issues, so anything is possible.

- en: The Arrow Lake processors are set to use a new microarchitecture and faster
    DDR5-6400 memory. Notably, this series will also end Intel's support for DDR4
    memory, meaning that both of the world's largest x86 chipmakers will be all-in
    with DDR5.

- en: 'When we talk about Intel''s Arrow Lake products, we should remember the process
    technology that Intel is set to use to make these products: the Intel 20A process
    technology (2nm-class). This fabrication node introduces RibbonFET gate-all-around
    transistors and the PowerVia backside power delivery network. Both innovations
    can enable Intel to optimize power consumption, increase performance, and boost
    transistor density. How this will affect the performance of socketed Intel''s
    Arrow Lake processors remains to be seen. Still, the new CPUs will clearly have
    some advantages over existing products due to the innovations brought by the process
    node.'

    cards and two x4 lanes for solid-state drives. Meanwhile, the whole platform supports
    a DisplayPort output at a UHB20 rate and Thunderbolt 4 connectors, assuming that
    the motherboard has an appropriate Hayden Bridge retimer (which will not be cheap).

    are up-to-date or outdated, but with Arrow Lake moving closer to market, we expect
    to learn more in the coming months.
