    the lawsuit, a workplace cultural audit, diversity "hiring targets" for each year,

    were advised by Dr. Herbert Wong, who helped the NBCFAE analyze FAA diversity

    ATCs. By July 2013, the FAA created a "Barrier Analysis Implemention Team" (BAIT,
    and I swear I am not making this acronym up). Around this time, the FAA decided
    to pause the hiring of CTI graduates pending the implementation of the biographical
    assessment. Neither the schools that ran the CTI programs nor their students were
    informed of this when the decision was initially made. A number of students, including
    the class representative, passed the AT-SAT (in the case of the class representative,

- en: In 2014, the FAA rolled out the new biographical questionnaire in line with
    the Barrier Analysis recommendation, designed so that 90% or more of applicants
    would "fail." The questionnaire was not monitored, and people could take it at
    home. Questions asked prospective air traffic controllers how many sports they
    played in high school, how long they'd been unemployed recently, whether they
    were more eager or considerate, and seventy-some other questions. You can take
    a replica of it yourself [at Kai's Soapbox](https://kaisoapbox.github.io/faa_biographical_assessment/)

- en: CTI schools were [blindsided and outraged](https://ojs.library.okstate.edu/osu/index.php/CARI/article/download/7406/6805/14556)
    by this change. A report on FAA hiring issues found that 70% of CTI administrators
    agreed that the changes in the process had led to a negative effect on the air
    traffic control infrastructure. One respondent stated their "numbers [had] been
    devastated," and the majority agreed that it would severely impact the health
    of their own programs. The largest program dropped from more than 600 students
    to less than 300\. Concurrent to all of this, NBCFAE members were hard at work.
    In particular, one Shelton Snow, an FAA employee and then-president of the NBCFAE's
    Washington Suburban chapter, provided NBCFAE members with "buzz words" in January
    2014 that would automatically push their resumes to the tops of HR files. A 2013
    NBCFAE meeting advised members to "please include [on resumes] if you are a NBCFAE
    Member. [...] Can you see the strategy", emphasizing they were "only concerned"
    with the employment of "African-Americans, women ... and other minorities."

    600 多名学生下降到不到 300 名。与此同时，NBCFAE 成员们也在努力。特别是，一位名叫雪顿·斯诺的 FAA 员工，当时是 NBCFAE 华盛顿郊区分会的会长，于
    2014 年 1 月向 NBCFAE 成员提供了“热门词语”，这些词语将自动将他们的简历推送到人力资源档案的顶部。2013 年 NBCFAE 会议建议成员“请在简历上标明
    [如果你是 NBCFAE 成员的话...] 你能看到策略吗”，强调他们“只关心”“非裔美国人，妇女...和其他少数族裔”的就业。
- en: After the 2014 biographical questionnaire was released, Snow took it a step
    further. As Fox Business reported (related in Rojas v. FAA), he sent voice-mail
    messages to NBCFAE applicants, advising them on the specific answers they needed
    to enter into the Biographical Assessment to avoid failing, stating that he was
    "about 99 point 99 percent sure that it is exactly how you need to answer each

    99.99% 的把握，这确切地是你需要回答每个问题的方式。”
- en: Per [a 2016 Yahoo Finance article](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/faa-admits-emails-missing-air-120000672.html),
    an internal FAA report cleared the NBCFAE and Snow of wrongdoing. **UPDATE:**

    ago, the full report is available, and I have added it to the above Google Drive
    folder. See notable excerpts [here](https://x.com/tracewoodgrains/status/1753433850594697276?s=20).
    It confirms Snow sent the emails and held the conference in question and answered
    questions about the applications with an explicit goal of discriminating by race.
    It also includes witness testimony of a NBCFAE hiring workshop during the application
    period in which FAA employees helped people directly with their applications.
    Ultimately, though, the report declines to recommend prosecution.

    FAA 员工直接帮助人们处理他们的申请。然而，报告最终决定不建议起诉。
- en: 'A few changes were made by 2015\. In 2016, Congress passed Public Law 114-190,
    which among other things banned the use of biographical assessments as a first-line
    hiring tool for air traffic controllers. People snubbed by the process filed dozens
    of lawsuits as a result, culminating in the class-action suit now underway as
    Brigida v. Buttigieg. In arguing to deny class certification, the defendants argued
    that the "underlying grievance—that they pursued college degrees in reliance on
    their perception that the role of the CTI program in the FAA''s hiring process
    would never change—is not actionable." In a moment with a certain bitter irony,
    black CTI graduates who were left adrift by this process are the only demographic
    left out of the class: while the plaintiffs tried to include them initially, the
    court denied certification until they were excluded. The class has been granted
    certification, and the suit is slowly rolling forward. Finally, in 2024, twitter
    personality Will Stancil [picked a fight](https://twitter.com/whstancil/status/1750049128166425074)

    Brigida v. Buttigieg 集体诉讼。在辩论中，被告主张“基本的诉求——即依赖于他们对 FAA 招聘流程中 CTI 计划角色永远不会改变的认识而追求学位——是不可实施的。”在一个很有点讽刺意味的时刻，因此流程被遗弃的黑人
    CTI 毕业生是唯一被排除在该类别之外的人群：尽管最初原告尝试把他们包括在内，但法庭最终排除他们的资格。这一类别已经被核准，诉讼正在缓慢地推进。最后，在 2024
