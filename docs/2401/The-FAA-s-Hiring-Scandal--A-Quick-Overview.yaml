- en: A scandal at the FAA has been moving on a slow-burn through the courts for a
    decade, culminating in the class-action lawsuit currently known as [Brigida v.
    Buttigieg](https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/4542755/brigida-v-united-states-department-of-transportation/),
    brought by a class who spent years and thousands of dollars in coursework to become
    air traffic controllers, only to be dismissed by a pass-fail biographical questionnaire
    with a >90% fail rate, implemented without warning after many of them had already
    taken, and passed, a skill assessment. The questionnaire awarded points for factors
    like "lowest grade in high school is science," something explicitly admitted by
    the FAA in a motion to deny class certification.

    military veterans, graduates of the "Air Traffic-Collegiate Training Initiative"
    (AT-CTI) program, and the general public. Whichever route they came from, each
    candidate would be required to take and pass the eight-hour AT-SAT cognitive test
    to begin serious training. This test was validated as being effective as recently

    something that seems to have influenced even the scoring structure of the AT-SAT
    cognitive test used for pre-employment screening of air traffic control candidates.
    Leading up to 2014, that pressure intensified, with the National Black Coalition
    of Federal Aviation Employees (NBCFAE) leading the push.

    Mallory, wrote "A Business Case and Strategic Plan to Address Under-Representation
    of Minorities, Women, and People with Targeted Disabilities," recommending, per
    the lawsuit, a workplace cultural audit, diversity "hiring targets" for each year,
    and "allowing RNO- [Race and National Origin] and gender-conscious hiring." They
    were advised by Dr. Herbert Wong, who helped the NBCFAE analyze FAA diversity
    data in 2009\. Wong authored a report concluding that the FAA was "the least diverse
    agency within the executive branch of the federal government." Mallory and Wong
    were consulted as part of the 2014 test replacement process.

    and the Secretary for the Department of Transportation claiming disparate treatment,
    adopted a strategic plan "advocating for affirmative employment, obtaining an
    ''independent valuation of hiring and/or screening tools,'' and pursuing litigation,"
    a "Talking Points" document pushing the FAA to address diversity, and the creation
    of a group called "Team 7." In 2012, Team 7 members met with the secretary of
    the Department of Transportation, the FAA administrator, and senior FAA leaders
    to discuss diversity, after which the FAA commissioned a "Barrier Analysis" with
    a number of recommendations. Central to this: the cognitive test posed a barrier
    for black candidates, so they recommended using a biographical test first to "maximiz[e]
    diversity," eliminating the vast majority of candidates prior to any cognitive
    test.'

    with the DOT, FAA, Congressional Black Caucus, and others to push diversity among
    ATCs. By July 2013, the FAA created a "Barrier Analysis Implemention Team" (BAIT,
    and I swear I am not making this acronym up). Around this time, the FAA decided
    to pause the hiring of CTI graduates pending the implementation of the biographical
    assessment. Neither the schools that ran the CTI programs nor their students were
    informed of this when the decision was initially made. A number of students, including
    the class representative, passed the AT-SAT (in the case of the class representative,
    with a perfect score), not knowing they would never get to use it.

- en: In 2014, the FAA rolled out the new biographical questionnaire in line with
    the Barrier Analysis recommendation, designed so that 90% or more of applicants
    would "fail." The questionnaire was not monitored, and people could take it at
    home. Questions asked prospective air traffic controllers how many sports they
    played in high school, how long they'd been unemployed recently, whether they
    were more eager or considerate, and seventy-some other questions. You can take
    a replica of it yourself [at Kai's Soapbox](https://kaisoapbox.github.io/faa_biographical_assessment/)
    to see what they were up against. Graduates of the CTI program, like everyone
    else, had to "pass" this or they would be disqualified from further consideration.
    This came alongside other changes de-prioritizing CTI graduates.

    by this change. A report on FAA hiring issues found that 70% of CTI administrators
    agreed that the changes in the process had led to a negative effect on the air
    traffic control infrastructure. One respondent stated their "numbers [had] been
    devastated," and the majority agreed that it would severely impact the health
    of their own programs. The largest program dropped from more than 600 students
    to less than 300\. Concurrent to all of this, NBCFAE members were hard at work.
    In particular, one Shelton Snow, an FAA employee and then-president of the NBCFAE's
    Washington Suburban chapter, provided NBCFAE members with "buzz words" in January
    2014 that would automatically push their resumes to the tops of HR files. A 2013
    NBCFAE meeting advised members to "please include [on resumes] if you are a NBCFAE
    Member. [...] Can you see the strategy", emphasizing they were "only concerned"
    with the employment of "African-Americans, women ... and other minorities."

    further. As Fox Business reported (related in Rojas v. FAA), he sent voice-mail
    messages to NBCFAE applicants, advising them on the specific answers they needed
    to enter into the Biographical Assessment to avoid failing, stating that he was
    "about 99 point 99 percent sure that it is exactly how you need to answer each
    question."

    an internal FAA report cleared the NBCFAE and Snow of wrongdoing. **UPDATE:**
    Thanks to the tireless work of people who submitted FOIA requests on this years
    ago, the full report is available, and I have added it to the above Google Drive
    folder. See notable excerpts [here](https://x.com/tracewoodgrains/status/1753433850594697276?s=20).
    It confirms Snow sent the emails and held the conference in question and answered
    questions about the applications with an explicit goal of discriminating by race.
    It also includes witness testimony of a NBCFAE hiring workshop during the application
    period in which FAA employees helped people directly with their applications.
    Ultimately, though, the report declines to recommend prosecution.

    which among other things banned the use of biographical assessments as a first-line
    hiring tool for air traffic controllers. People snubbed by the process filed dozens
    of lawsuits as a result, culminating in the class-action suit now underway as
    Brigida v. Buttigieg. In arguing to deny class certification, the defendants argued
    that the "underlying grievance—that they pursued college degrees in reliance on
    their perception that the role of the CTI program in the FAA''s hiring process
    would never change—is not actionable." In a moment with a certain bitter irony,
    black CTI graduates who were left adrift by this process are the only demographic
    left out of the class: while the plaintiffs tried to include them initially, the
    court denied certification until they were excluded. The class has been granted
    certification, and the suit is slowly rolling forward. Finally, in 2024, twitter
    personality Will Stancil [picked a fight](https://twitter.com/whstancil/status/1750049128166425074)
    with right-wing blogger Steve Sailer, who like many in right-wing media had released
    [occasional articles](https://www.takimag.com/article/die-in-the-air/) touching
    on this case. Their scuffle stirrred up enough attention towards it to catch my

    A thousand things had to go wrong to get to this point, and if people want to
    harp on it—let them. But this is not a fundamentally partisan issue. Virtually
    nobody, looking dispassionately at that questionnaire, wants to defend it. Everybody
    wants competent, effective air traffic controllers. Everybody, I suspect, can

    for many, it is simply the same neglect everybody else has shown towards the case
    that has led it to linger awkwardly unresolved for a decade. There is nothing
    to be gained from fighting the suit further. It is a black eye on the FAA, a black
    eye on the DOT, and a black eye on our public institutions as a whole. People
    have paid shockingly little attention to it as it's rolled through the courts,
    in part, no doubt, because anything touching on diversity is a hot topic that
    becomes a culture war football in a moment. My instinct, looking at the whole
    mess, is that the DOT and FAA should publicly apologize, settle, and do their
    best to begin making right what was so badly broken.
