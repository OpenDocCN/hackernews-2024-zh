    start production in mid-2025! Luckily, their delivery timelines are always spot
    on and nothing ever seems to go awry on Elon Musk’s watch. Don’t think about the
    [production hell](https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/austin-we-have-problem-tesla-descends-into-battery-hell-2023-12-21/?ref=disconnect.blog)
    the company is experiencing in Austin and the struggles it’s having with [the
    Cybertruck](https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/17/24041344/tesla-cybertruck-hype-elon-musk-range?ref=disconnect.blog),
    nor how it [hit the brakes](https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/tesla-reports-lower-third-quarter-margin-2023-10-18/?ref=disconnect.blog)
    on its big Mexican manufacturing facility just a few months ago. Oh, and whatever
    you do, don’t look at its fourth quarter results.

    its earnings and there wasn’t much good news to be found. The company’s revenue
    and profit figures missed analysts’ projections, operating margin was almost half
    of what it was in 2022, and automotive revenue increased by just one percent.
    The expectations for 2024 aren’t looking so hot either: Tesla warned its volume
    growth could be “notably lower” this year and wouldn’t even provide guidance on
    what it expected that growth to be.'

    meat to dangle in front of investors and the cult to try to distract from the
    terrible news. While that may have worked for Musk in the past, it’s not working
    very well right now. Tesla’s share price plunged 12% after the earnings call,
    wiping over $70 billion off its valuation, putting the drop so far this year at
    28%.

    claims) to keep investor interest high and the money flowing, but it’s not clear
    he has the same power he once did and that spells trouble. As competition mounts,
    regulatory scrutiny increases, internal problems continue to hold it back, and
    its CEO goes off the rails, the company is facing escalating pressures at the
    very moment it’s least equipped to overcome them. Tesla is far from dead, but
    it’s likely facing its biggest test yet and Musk may be a bigger liability than
    he’s willing to admit.

    (EV) rollout in the US hit some headwinds. US EV sales were [up over 50%](https://insideevs.com/news/705215/us-plugin-car-sales-2023/?ref=disconnect.blog)
    in 2023 over the previous year to 9.1% of total vehicle sales, but the rate of
    growth trailed off in the second half of the year, even as manufacturers tried
    to entice consumers with lower prices. That’s led to [canceled investments](https://www.businessinsider.com/electric-car-ev-sales-prices-problem-transportation-2024-1?ref=disconnect.blog)

    he was an engineering genius who pushed the company ahead against all odds. In
    truth, as Edward Niedermeyer’s *Ludicrous: The Unvarnished Story of Tesla Motors*
    shows quite clearly, Musk’s decisions often had the effect of delaying Tesla’s
    new models, making them more difficult and expense to manufacture, and thus creating
    the crises the company constantly found itself in. Its saving grace was [the myth
    built around Musk](https://techwontsave.us/elon-musk-unmasked?ref=disconnect.blog)

    he’s become increasingly erratic over the past number of years, in part due to
    his [more frequent drug use](https://www.wsj.com/business/elon-musk-illegal-drugs-e826a9e1?ref=disconnect.blog#),
    as recently chronicled by the *Wall Street Journal*. That report isn’t to be dismissed
    lightly. The number of high-placed sources speaking out about the threat he poses
    to the companies he controls because of his outbursts and bad decisions suggests
    he could be facing a serious leadership challenge if he can’t get control of himself.

    would be a good idea. Musk’s value to the company erodes with every passing day

    abandon its work on a mass-market vehicle. Instead, on August 18, 2022, Musk instructed
    them to work exclusively on a robotaxi without pedals or a steering wheel. When
    they pushed back, he got angry and told them, “Let me be clear. This vehicle must
    be designed as a clean Robotaxi. We’re going to take that risk. It’s my fault
    if it fucks up.” A few weeks later, he told them, “This will be a historically
    mega-revolutionary product. … This is the product that makes Tesla a ten-trillion
    company.”

    capabilities weren’t matching Musk’s claims, nor his fantasies about its future
    progress. In September 2022, Chief Designer Franz von Holzhausen and VP of Vehicle
    Engineering Lars Moravy had to sit him down and explain that without a cheaper
    model, Tesla wouldn’t hit its growth targets. They proposed making a vehicle platform
    that could work for a robotaxi and a $25,000 model to target a much wider market.
    Isaacson describes Musk not being happy with the new direction and saying the
    more affordable vehicle was “not that exciting of a product,” but he eventually
    had to accept the advice of the real experts.

    count it out, especially if the people close to Musk can convince him to get his
    act together or go around him to keep investors onboard and drinking the Kool-Aid.
    That might work, because if they don’t place their faith in the company, Tesla’s
    share price will tank and take their investments along with it. We shouldn’t underestimate
    how Tesla’s inflated valuation has insulated Musk from real accountability from
    his board and investors for so long.
