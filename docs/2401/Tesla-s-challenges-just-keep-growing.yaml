    Engineering Lars Moravy had to sit him down and explain that without a cheaper
    model, Tesla wouldn’t hit its growth targets. They proposed making a vehicle platform
    that could work for a robotaxi and a $25,000 model to target a much wider market.

  zh: 但特斯拉业务的另一个方面不容忽视，即使其车辆业务不能成功实现大众市场转型，也会给予它相当大程度的杠杆。我不是在谈论[骗局太阳能屋](https://www.fastcompany.com/40422084/inside-steel-pulse-the-mysterious-project-that-became-elon-musks-solar-roof?ref=disconnect.blog)或[胡扯机器人](https://www.benzinga.com/analyst-ratings/analyst-color/24/01/36786267/exclusive-teslas-humanoid-robot-was-a-fake-and-elon-musk-doesnt-deliver-at-all-says?ref=disconnect.blog)，而是它控制的基础设施，这对于推动电动汽车未来成为现实至关重要：超级充电站网络。
- en: Last year saw [virtually every major automaker](https://www.consumerreports.org/cars/hybrids-evs/tesla-superchargers-open-to-other-evs-what-to-know-a9262067544/?ref=disconnect.blog)
    announce plans to adopt Tesla’s charging plug to gain access to the Superchargers
    within the next year or two. After years of trying to adopt a common standard,
    they’re opting for Tesla’s proprietary option because the EV charging network
    is far too unreliable and confusing. By gaining access to the Superchargers, other
    manufacturers get access to a large network of chargers that tend to be properly
    maintained and will reliable charge vehicles relatively quickly.

  zh: 去年，几乎[每家主要汽车制造商](https://www.consumerreports.org/cars/hybrids-evs/tesla-superchargers-open-to-other-evs-what-to-know-a9262067544/?ref=disconnect.blog)都宣布计划在未来一两年内采用特斯拉的充电插头以获得进入超级充电站的权限。经过多年试图采用共同标准，它们选择了特斯拉的专有选项，因为电动汽车充电网络实在是太不可靠和令人困惑了。通过获得进入超级充电站，其他制造商就可以使用一个庞大的充电网络，这些充电站往往得到了适当的维护，并且可以相对快速地可靠地给车辆充电。
- en: Tesla has no intention of retreating from the vehicle market, but if the competition
    gets too aggressive and it can’t get its manufacturing acumen where it needs to
    be to effectively execute a mass-market vehicle, it still controls the infrastructure
    that all the other manufacturers are relying on. That’s not to be ignored, but
    it’s also not the path to becoming a “ten trillion” business that Musk fantasizes
    about and investors dream he may one day deliver.

  zh: 特斯拉没有从汽车市场撤退的意图，但如果竞争过于激烈，并且它无法将制造能力发展到能够有效地执行大规模市场的程度，它仍然控制着其他所有制造商都依赖的基础设施。这一点不容忽视，但也不是马斯克幻想中成为“十万亿”业务的路径，投资者梦想着有一天他可能会实现这一目标。
