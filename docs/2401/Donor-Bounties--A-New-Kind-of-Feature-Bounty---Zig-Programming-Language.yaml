- en: '[We have previously written](/news/bounties-damage-open-source-projects/) about
    how bounties can be damaging to Open Source projects as, even when the subject
    of the bounty is in accordance with the wishes of the project maintainers, it
    still fosters competition at the expense of cooperation and more in general is
    a strictly worse version of just offering contract work, as bounties default to
    potentially unfair resolutions when things don’t go as planned, among other things.'

- en: As we also pointed out in the past, this is an issue with certain kinds of bounties,
    and not others. One positive example are bug bounties, where the un-coordinated
    nature of the work is nowhere near as big of a problem (or at the very least is
    a *problem*, not a *“feature”* of the system).

    issues with are generally known as “feature bounties”.

- en: 'So we did some thinking and figured out a way of mitigating all the flaws of
    feature bounties. The change is minimal but mutates drastically the nature of
    the bounty, here it is: **instead of offering money to the implementer, the money
    is offered as a donation to the open source project itself**.'

- en: By offering the bounty to the open source project, the cooperative nature of
    open source work is fully preserved. Of course giving money to the project and
    not to who is doing the work is very different in nature, but it makes a lot of
    sense when the project is run by a non-profit corporation that pays developers,
    like in the case for the Zig Software Foundation.

    a donor bounty for a given already-accepted proposal (i.e. a GitHub Issue that

    a donor bounty: we only accept donor bounties on already-accepted proposals and
    even then we will only agree to setup a donor bounty if the feature is fit from
    multiple angles, including a high degree of confidence on our end that the feature
    in question has a very low risk of getting axed in future iterations of the language,
    as a donor bounty **does not** guarantee that the feature will be part of Zig’s
    final design.'

  zh: 有一件事需要注意，那就是我们接受捐助赏金有一个很高的门槛：我们只接受已经被接受的提案的捐助赏金，即使这样，我们也只会同意设置捐助赏金，如果这个功能从多个角度来看都合适，包括我们对于这个功能有很高程度的信心，即这个功能在未来语言的迭代中几乎不会被取消，因为捐助赏金**并不**保证该功能会成为
    Zig 最终设计的一部分。

    Software Foundation; they are instead built upon mutual trust and goodwill between
