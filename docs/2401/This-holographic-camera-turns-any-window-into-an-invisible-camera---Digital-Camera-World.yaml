    Holocam technology to [CES 2024](https://www.digitalcameraworld.com/news/ces-2024-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-camera-and-tech-showcase),
    which can turn any glass screen into a camera. This means that everything from
    the window in your car to the screen on your laptop to the glass on your front
    door can now possess an invisible image sensor.'

    eliminates the need for cutouts or punch holes – meaning you can have direct eye
    contact with the person you're chatting to, because the camera can be placed anywhere
    on (or should that be *in*) the screen.

    elements to redirect the incoming light of a transparent medium to a hidden image
    sensor."

- en: Zeiss' [CES](https://www.digitalcameraworld.com/tag/ces) presentation is focused
    around its Multifunctional Smart Glass system in general, with a focus on applications
    in automobiles, so many of its use cases are based around how holography can improve
    in-car operability. However, it's easy to see how this could be truly transformative
    technology in the wider world.

    you to look anywhere on your screen. Parking cameras that can be completely hidden.
    Face or gesture recognition on any screen, including to unlock doors. Fatigue
    detection for drivers. Or, you know, phones and tablets without bloody notches
    or punch holes.

    possibilities. Some of Zeiss' bullet points include "large aperture invisible
    camera" and "individual adjustment of orientation and size of the field of views."
    Which makes me wonder, what *is* the maximum aperture and focal range of a camera
    like this?

    fear around hidden cameras in Airbnbs, the idea of every single window (or even
    shower door) in a rental property being able to spy on you is a little disconcerting.

    how it comes into everyday use.
