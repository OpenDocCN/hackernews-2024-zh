    after the response of Apple about the EU’s DMA.

- en: My blog is followed by tech people, and I suppose everyone here knows the subject
    and just want to read my old thoughts about “what iz goin’ on in da’techie world?!”,
    but let me summarize briefly what happened recently in the latest episode of “Apple
    and the DMA”…
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In order to comply with the [EU’s DMA (Digital Markets Act)](https://commission.europa.eu/strategy-and-policy/priorities-2019-2024/europe-fit-digital-age/digital-markets-act-ensuring-fair-and-open-digital-markets_en),
    Apple has been obliged to make a few “concessions” about its internal apps management
    / system to match the requirements.

    waited since a long time, is the App Store.

    interested in listening to their decisions to know how / when they will handle
    the requests from the EU.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Their response has been released online on 26th of January 2024, ["*Update on
    apps distributed in the European Union*"](https://developer.apple.com/fr/support/dma-and-apps-in-the-eu/)
    and, as a developer point of view, they seriously disappointed me and made me
    realize **again** how evil ~~Tim~~ Apple is.

    a few months ago (in an epic fail): after a limit of downloads (1_000_000 to be
    accurate), the developer will have to pay 0.50$ **per download** and **each month**
    to Apple.'
  prefs: []

- en: Second, to be considered as an alternative App Store and to be published as
    it, the main entity that holds this alternative App Store will have to prove that
    they have 1_000_000$ in their bank account, followed with a very big list of other
    “necessary requirements”…

- en: 'But wait wait wait, the farce does not stop here: the app developer **still**
    has to pay a fee of 99$ to publish and sign the app to be installed on iPhones
    via an alternative App Store… so why this 0.50 cents fee **per** download for
    an app that is **not** published in the official App Store? Who can tell me again
    that “the app costs in Apple servers” in this case?'

    “force” developers not to release their apps in alternative stores, then alternative
    stores won’t be a thing!'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But, weirdly, Apple is managing its communication as publishing on alternative
    App Store is a “gift” for developers who want to release their app(s) in the EU.
    A gift that costs $$.

    Store apps shows clearly that the App Store is 95% of free apps](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1020996/distribution-of-free-and-paid-ios-apps/).
    However they are helping developers of paid apps to make more money, which might
    be okay as they represent only 6% (at most) of the distribution of the App Store.

    isn’t just simply “**we don’t care!**” maybe.

    apps in this situation, but they keep all of them behind their back telling everyone
    else that “**if they are following us this is simply by choice**”. The term “choice”
    is inconvenient here, or *incomplete*. I prefer to talk about a “poisoned gift”
    actually, as the real deal is, let’s be honest:'

    products owners. The most difficult thing is not to move from one operating system
    to another actually (especially for a software developer), but actually quitting
    an ecosystem for another. This is pretty hard when you are inside the same ecosystem
    and consume **inside** that ecosystem since a while now…
