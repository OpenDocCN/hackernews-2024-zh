    the Soviet AS-4 "Kitchen" missile. The AS-4 flight profile is to launch from a
    high altitude, burn its rocket to increase altitude and speed, and then dive toward
    the target. These missiles would be fired in masses by Soviet bombers to overwhelm
    US fleet defenses. Air defense missiles of the time had "semi-active" seekers
    at best. They required the ship's radar to paint the target, limiting how many
    targets a ship could engage at any time. Having a radar with a long-range to maximize
    engagement time was critical.

    its air defense missiles to have active seekers that require less guidance from
    the ships and allow faster engagements.

    freedom to design the ships. A vessel might have multiple radars or could carry

    Further increasing width also increases drag. Making the ship taller presents
