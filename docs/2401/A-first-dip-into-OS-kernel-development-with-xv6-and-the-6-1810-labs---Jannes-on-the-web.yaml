- en: One of my favorite courses during my computer science bachelor was the operating
    systems course. I like learning theory so I soaked up all the concepts taught
    during the course, but I can’t recall that we had any sort of practical assignments
    which is such a shame. Then during my master degree there was no operating system
    course available to take which already made me sad back then and looking back
    now I even find it more regrettable.

  zh: 我本科计算机科学专业期间最喜欢的课程之一是操作系统课程。我喜欢学习理论，所以我吸收了课程中教授的所有概念，但我不记得我们有任何实践作业，这真是遗憾。然后在我的硕士学位期间，没有操作系统课程可供选择，这让我当时感到很沮丧，现在回想起来，我甚至觉得更加遗憾。
- en: The xv6 kernel is a very small operating system kernel developed for teaching
    a practical operating system development course at MIT. It is open source and
    comes with an excellent book that explains concepts, code structure and many core
    routines in great detail. I have been aware of these resources for a while and
    with more time on my hands recently, I finally decided to take a deeper look and
    was so grateful to find the lab assignments for MIT’s 6.828 “Operating System
    Engineering” course to be fully available online including correctness and regression
    tests that can be executed locally. The [2023 course website](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2023/index.html)
    includes setup instructions for the labs and helpful tips, the lab assignments
    are branches of a publicly accessible git repository that is a fork of the [xv6-riscv
    repository available on github](https://github.com/mit-pdos/xv6-riscv).

  zh: xv6 内核是麻省理工学院开设的一门实践性操作系统开发课程的一个非常小的操作系统内核。它是开源的，并配有一本优秀的书籍，详细解释了概念、代码结构和许多核心例程。我已经注意到这些资源一段时间了，最近手头有更多时间，我终于决定深入研究，并感到非常感激，因为发现了麻省理工学院的6.828“操作系统工程”课程的实验作业完全可以在线获取，包括可以在本地执行的正确性和回归测试。[2023
    年的课程网站](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2023/index.html)包括实验室的设置说明和有用的提示，实验作业是一个公开可访问的
    git 存储库的分支，该存储库是 [GitHub 上可用的 xv6-riscv 存储库](https://github.com/mit-pdos/xv6-riscv)的一个分支。
- en: The xv6 kernel sources come with a build system that allows booting the kernel
    in QEMU and includes a debugging target for debugging with GDB. The 10 labs follow
    the progression of chapters in the book closely and generally add or improve functionality.
    This ranges from adding simple system calls to reducing lock contention in the
    file system implementation and driver code for a network interface card. I found
    the progression of the labs and the exercises themselves to be designed very well
    and came away with a feeling of deeply learning about implementation challenges
    of core concepts/functionality. I finished the lab assignments over the course
    of about 3 months of at least 1-2 days of working on them per week. Each lab consists
    of 1-3 assignments that generally build up in difficulty and some of the labs
    were significantly harder or required more work than others.

  zh: xv6 内核源代码附带了一个构建系统，允许在 QEMU 中引导内核，并包含一个用于 GDB 调试的调试目标。这 10 个实验室紧密遵循书中章节的进度，并通常添加或改进功能。这从添加简单的系统调用到减少文件系统实现中的锁竞争以及为网络接口卡编写驱动程序代码等。我发现实验室的进展和练习本身设计得非常好，让我对核心概念/功能的实现挑战有深刻的了解。我花了大约
    3 个月的时间完成了实验作业，每周至少有 1-2 天的时间来完成它们。每个实验室包含 1-3 个作业，通常难度逐渐增加，有些实验室比其他实验室更难或需要更多的工作。
- en: There is really not enough words of praise I have for the xv6 kernel, the book
    and the labs, I wholeheartedly recommend anyone who would like to have a hands-on
    introduction to OS dev to just do the 6.828 labs while reading along in the book.
    I am happy to have taken the plunge and finding so much joy in the practical approach
    to learning. It also made realize again how magical I find the field of operating
    systems, the design considerations, the implementation challenges/hacks and the
    historical evolution. Being a hoarder, I naturally have already amassed a wealth
    of OS dev resources to look into, so now is the time to pick something practical
    to continue the journey :)

  zh: 对于 xv6 内核、这本书以及相关实验，我实在是赞不绝口。我由衷推荐任何想要亲身体验操作系统开发的人，只需在阅读书籍的同时完成 6.828 实验即可。我很高兴能够决定投入其中，并在实践中找到如此多的乐趣。这也让我再次意识到，我对操作系统领域有多么着迷——设计考量、实现挑战/技巧以及历史演变。作为一个囤积者，我自然已经积累了大量的操作系统开发资源要去探索，所以现在是选择一些实践内容继续这段旅程的时候了
    :)
