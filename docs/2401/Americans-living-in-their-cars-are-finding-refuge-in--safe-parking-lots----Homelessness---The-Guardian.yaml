    parked in a lot on Grayson Street in Berkeley, [California](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/california),
    as part of the city’s first attempt at a “safe parking lot”.

    the space had been mostly unused since 2008\. But a local non-profit, the Dorothy
    Day House, created the Safe Parking and Respite Kickstart (Spark) program to help
    “alleviate the crisis of unsheltered and encampment homeless” in one of the nation’s
    most expensive housing markets.

    People without stable, stationary housing could park their vehicles there for
    free without fear of violating city ordinances against sidewalk occupation and
    long-term parking. Spark provided water and toilets, and it allowed occupants
    to have pets and in-and-out privileges without a curfew – features that are often
    hard to come by on the street or in homeless shelters.

    vehicles. [A 2018 survey of King county, Washington](https://komonews.com/news/local/annual-king-co-homeless-count-finds-more-people-living-in-vehicles#!),
    showed that 3,372 people were living in their cars, a 46% increase from the year

    from its count in 2017; in nearby Oakland, vehicle-based homelessness more than
    doubled in the same timespan. It’s not surprising that municipalities are starting
    their own safe-lot programs; in 2023, the cities of [Vista, California,](https://www.kpbs.org/news/local/2023/08/18/vistas-first-safe-parking-lot-opens-to-assist-with-homelessness)

    That agreement was supposed to run until September 2022 but was extended through
    that year. But on 31 December, heavy storms descended on the area, resulting in
    nearly 4in of rain in a day. Still, the RV dwellers were given until 4pm to leave
    before the gates were locked.

    began hauling out other members of the community. “We towed James and Sarah’s
    RV out of the lot and took it a few streets over,” Whitson said. “Then we drove
    back and towed out Sam’s little trailer that he lives in.” By 6pm, when there
    were only two RVs left, a tow truck finished clearing the lot.

    so much value to being parked somewhere other than the streets,” she said.

    and company have become the go-to authorities for others to glean information
    on how to run such lots. They have consulted with more than 300 communities, and
    even provide a manual outlining best practices and tips (a second edition is forthcoming).
    “It’s almost at the point where we can’t field requests any more, unfortunately,”
    Schwarz said.

    of hours is important because it makes people feel at home and in control. Financial
    assistance like gas cards or money for vehicle repairs helps.Schwarz also believes
    it’s important that organizations that run the lots not pay for access.

    One of New Beginnings’ largest costs is insurance for general liability. It costs
    the organization more than $30,000 a year, and it has yet to file a single claim.
    “We insure every single lot so that people feel safe,” Schwartz said.

- en: But which people? One major obstacle to getting a safe lot approved is the almost-inevitable
    opposition from property owners and business interests, who associate the homeless
    population with the disruption of private and public spaces. “They have a tendency
    to want to put the lot next to the police station,” said Schwarz. “Most [lot users]
    aren’t comfortable with that, not because they have any criminal background, but
    because it feels stigmatizing.” Many neighbors’ objections take the form of noise
    concerns. Those issues or complaints are important to resolve immediately, since
    people living in RVs often conduct their activities outdoors.

    and it’s like, ‘OK, you can’t do that,’” Schwartz said. “The grassroots, person-to-person
    conversation is critical because you’re moving into somebody’s neighborhood. So
    you want [existing residents] to feel safe, and they want to understand what’s
    happening.”

    said Mike Phillips, senior director at Jewish Family Service, a non-profit that
    operates six safe lots around San Diego county. “The idea is that someone can

    because there’s no alternative for people who’ve worked all their lives, and either
    their partner or spouse dies so their income is reduced,” said Schwarz. “Or they’ve
    been living in the same apartment for 30 years and whoever owns it wants to put
    their grandparents in there. So they evict them, and they go into the rental market
    and get sticker shock.”

    at New Beginnings but is trying to re-enter housing. When I spoke to him in late
    November, he was about to get fingerprinted so that he would be able to access
    a voucher that would cover a portion of his rent. While he waited, this transitional
    space offered respite without worry.

    that a cop will pull up and ask you to leave,” Villacana said. “So it’s reassuring

    the time you have to leave.”

    without enough money to stay housed in the first place. The lots have community
    benefits, such as fellow members watching each other’s belongings and looking
    out for one another.This structure has allowed Villacana to stay sober; he hasn’t
    had a drink since June, he said. He also landed a job as a lot monitor at New
    Beginnings, checking the premises or helping clients who need a battery jump.

    “Hopefully within a month or so, I’ll finally have housing.” He plans to continue
    working at New Beginnings after he does.
