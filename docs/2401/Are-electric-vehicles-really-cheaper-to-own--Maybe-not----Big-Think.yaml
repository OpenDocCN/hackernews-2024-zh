- en: Electric vehicles (EVs) have undeniably entered the mainstream in the United
    States. [According to estimates from Kelley Blue Book](https://www.coxautoinc.com/market-insights/q4-2023-ev-sales/),
    more EVs were sold last year than were sold between 2011 and 2018\. The roughly
    1.2 million new EVs put into service in 2023 represented 7.6% of the total U.S.
    car market. Cox Automotive’s Economics and Industry Insights team boldly [predicted](https://www.coxautoinc.com/market-insights/q4-2023-ev-sales/)
    that this share will climb to 10% in 2024.

    more expensive to purchase than gasoline-powered cars, with only a handful of
    options priced below $40,000\. EV proponents counter this drawback by [claiming
    that EVs](https://www.realclearscience.com/2022/06/14/the_biggest_myths_about_electric_vehicles_837234.html)
    are actually cheaper to own over the long term, with lower fuel and maintenance
    costs making up for the higher sticker price. Studies examining cars’ total cost
    of ownership back their assertions.

    After all, a wide variety of expenses factor into a vehicle’s lifetime cost, and
    excluding or miscalculating one could drastically skew the calculation. That’s
    why researchers at the University of Michigan’s Center for Sustainable Systems
    reviewed the dozens of “total cost of ownership” studies to craft their own. Published
    on January 3rd in the *Journal of Industrial Ecology*, their [analysis](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jiec.13463)
    aimed to correct for the shortcomings of previous research.

- en: The findings broadly challenge the optimistic cost-of-ownership assessments
    frequently touted by EV enthusiasts. The researchers found that while small and
    low-range EVs capable of traveling around 200 miles are indeed less expensive
    to own than their gas-powered counterparts, larger, long-range EVs that can cover
    400 miles are more expensive. Midsize SUV EVs — currently the top-selling models
    by far — only reach cost parity if government incentives are applied.

    prices, moderate climates, and direct purchase incentives, and for users with
    home charging access, time-of-use electricity pricing, and high annual mileage,”
    the researchers summarized.

- en: 'Since EVs are broadly more expensive to purchase upfront than comparable gas
    vehicles, the best way to assess whether an EV will ultimately be cheaper to own
    over the long term is by looking at its break-even time: when its lower recurring
    costs make up for its higher upfront cost. Woody and his team found that 200-mile
    range compact and midsize electric sedans reach this point in 3 to 7 years, while
    300-mile range variants take nine to 20 years to break even. Electric SUVs and
    trucks with 300 miles of range generally take more than 20 years, while 400-mile
    range EVs will never break even over their lifetimes.'

    credit, which reduces the purchase price of [certain EVs](https://www.consumerreports.org/cars/hybrids-evs/electric-cars-plug-in-hybrids-that-qualify-for-tax-credits-a7820795671/)
    by $3,750 or $7,500\. When included, the affordability scale tips decidedly toward
    EVs.

    and sedans, and under 5 years for small and midsize SUVs in each city,” the researchers
    reported. “Small 300-mile range vehicles break even in under 10 years in each
    city, and larger 300-mile range vehicles break even in under 10 years in many
    cities…there are a few cities in which 400-mile BEV compact and midsize sedans
    will break even with [gas-powered] counterparts after 15−20 years.”

    number of EVs will require battery replacements outside of their warranties, mandated
    to be a minimum of 8 years and 100,000 miles. Also unknown is how the costs of
    gasoline and electricity will change in the future. The study also didn’t compare
    vehicle costs in rural areas.

    own than a gas vehicle is the ability to charge at home, where electricity is
    cheapest. (In their analysis, the researchers assumed that EV owners charge at
    home 80% of the time and at public charging stations 20% of the time.) Without
    home charging, an EV will likely never be cheaper over its lifetime.

    constitutes a significant portion of its upfront cost. With battery prices predicted
    to continue steadily declining in the coming years, the math is likely to shift
