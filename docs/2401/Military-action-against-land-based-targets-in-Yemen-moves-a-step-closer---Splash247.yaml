    by extension the Suez Canal, container booking platform Freightos has reported
    ocean rates are spiking from Asia to North Europe, with rates more than doubling
    this week to more than $4,000 per feu, and Asia – Mediterranean rates climbing
    to $5,175 per feu. Some carriers have announced rates above $6,000 per feu for
    Mediterranean shipments starting mid-month, and surcharges of $500 to as much
    as $2,700 per container could make all-in prices even higher.
