    the way on many technological fronts. But the wheels of bureaucracy often turn
    incredibly slowly there. So much so, that the government still requires businesses
    to provide information on floppy disks and CD-ROMs when they submit certain official

    The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) is one of the first to make

    use of specific recording media such as floppy disks regarding application and

    on floppy disks under 34 ordinances. The same goes for CD-ROMs when it comes to

    that still require the likes of floppy disks, CD-ROMs and even MiniDiscs. The
    physical media requirements even applied to key industries such as utility suppliers,
    mining operations and aircraft and weapons manufacturers.

    as [](https://japantoday.com/category/national/japanese-government%E2%80%99s-ministry-of-economy-trade-and-industry-finally-stops-using-floppy-disks)
    points out. One major factor is that floppy disks can be hard to come by. Sony,

    Another is that some data types just won't fit on a floppy disk. A single photo

    planes need them for avionics, as do and some aging medical devices. It also took
