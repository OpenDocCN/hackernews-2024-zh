- en: Are you a greedy little fucker? Does your app have proprietary data in it? Are
    you building a walled garden full of weeds? Stop. Stop building apps that are
    hoarding my data. We have standard formats, let me export my data. Don't build
    apps that delete my health data from my phone when I delete your app.

    just let me export a text file if you're so lazy about building something structured.
    Just don't build stingy apps that keep my data locked in. Are you being pressured
    by your MBA colleagues to create vendor lock-ins? Tell them no, it's not worth
    it. We as users need to stop using apps that don't support standardized formats.

    pairs, just let me export it as a json, xml, or csv file. For the other files,
    images and videos, just let me download it.
