- en: NEWPORT NEWS, VA – The power of gravity is writ large across our visible universe.
    It can be seen in the lock step of moons as they circle planets; in wandering
    comets pulled off-course by massive stars; and in the swirl of gigantic galaxies.
    These awesome displays showcase gravity’s influence at the largest scales of matter.
    Now, nuclear physicists are discovering that gravity also has much to offer at
    matter’s smallest scales.

- en: New research conducted by nuclear physicists at the U.S. Department of Energy’s
    Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility is using a method that connects
    theories of gravitation to interactions among the smallest particles of matter
    to reveal new details at this smaller scale. The research has now revealed, for
    the first time, a snapshot of the distribution of the strong force inside the
    proton. This snapshot details the shear stress the force may exert on the quark
    particles that make up the proton. The result was recently published in [*Reviews
    of Modern Physics*](https://journals.aps.org/rmp/abstract/10.1103/RevModPhys.95.041002).

    Volker Burkert, the measurement reveals insight into the environment experienced
    by the proton’s building blocks. Protons are built of three quarks that are bound
    together by the strong force.

    to a quark to pull it out of the proton,” Burkert explained. “Nature, of course,
    does not allow us to separate just one quark from the proton because of a property
    of quarks called ‘color.’ There are three colors that mix quarks in the proton
    to make it appear colorless from the outside, a requirement for its existence
    in space. Trying to pull a colored quark out of the proton will produce a colorless
    quark/anti-quark pair, a meson, using the energy you put in to attempt to separate
    the quark, leaving a colorless proton (or neutron) behind. So, the 4-tons is an
    illustration of the strength of the force that is intrinsic in the proton.”

    The proton’s mechanical properties include its internal pressure ([measured in
    2018](https://www.jlab.org/news/releases/quarks-feel-pressure-proton)), its mass
    distribution (physical size), its angular momentum, and its shear stress (shown
    here). The result was made possible by a half-century-old prediction and two-decade-old
    data.

    gravity interacts with subatomic particles, such as the proton, such experiments
    could reveal the proton’s mechanical properties directly.

    force, for instance, there is 39 orders of magnitude of difference -  So it's
    completely hopeless, right?” explained Latifa Elouadhriri, a Jefferson Lab staff
    scientist and co-author on the study.

- en: The decades-old data came from experiments conducted with Jefferson Lab’s Continuous
    Electron Beam Accelerator Facility (CEBAF), a DOE Office of Science user facility.
    A typical CEBAF experiment would entail an energetic electron interacting with
    another particle by exchanging a packet of energy and a unit of angular momentum
    called a virtual photon with the particle. The energy of the electron dictates
    which particles it interacts with in this way and how they respond.

    out a quark/antiquark pair was applied to the proton by the highly energetic electron
    beam interacting with the proton in a target of liquified hydrogen gas.

    where you have an electron exchanging a virtual photon with the proton. And at
    the final state, the proton remained the same but recoiled, and you have one real
    very highly energetic photon produced, plus the scattered electron,” said Elouadhriri.
    “At the time we took the data, we were not aware that beyond the 3-dimensional
    imaging we intended with this data, we were also collecting the data needed for
    accessing the mechanical properties of the proton.”

    (DVCS) – could be connected to how gravity interacts with matter. The general
    version of this connection was stated in the 1973 textbook on Einstein’s general
    theory of relativity titled ‘Gravitation’ by Charles W. Misner, Kip S. Thorne
    and John Archibald Wheeler.

    from gravitation, because a mass-less spin-2 field would couple to the stress–energy
    tensor in the same way that gravitational interactions do.”

    the theoretical foundation that connects the DVCS process and gravitational interaction.

    of deeply virtual Compton scattering to the gravitational form factor. And we
    were able to use that for the first time and extract the pressure that we did
    in the Nature paper in 2018, and now the normal force and the shear force,” Burkert
    explained.

    they need from the existing DVCS data to enable the first determination of the
    proton’s mechanical size. They also hope to take advantage of newer, higher-statistics
    and higher-energy experiments that are continuing the DVCS research in the proton.

    of the proton.

    new facilities and new detector developments. We’re looking forward to seeing
