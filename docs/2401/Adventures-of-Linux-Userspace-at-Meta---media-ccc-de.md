The Linux Userspace team at Meta aims to make significant contributions to upstream userspace projects, while also ensuring that Meta is able to leverage those improvements. In this talk we'll give an overview of the team and brief history of how it was formalized. Then we'll dive deeper into some of the efforts we've worked on with the open source community and features we've adopted internally. Come if you enjoy hearing about systemd, BPF, distributions, and more!
