    famous purveyor of literary tchotchkes, the Strand, posted images of a pair of
    face masks to Instagram. One bore the store’s iconic logo; the other a quote often
    found on merchandise sold in the store: “A well-read woman is a dangerous creature.”
    For every mask purchased, a dollar would be donated to an anti-poverty nonprofit.
    Almost immediately, the masks sold out. This turned out to be unfortunate, as
    workers at the store could have used them a few weeks later.'

    Will Bobrowski, a shop steward with the union that represents Strand workers,
    told me. Nancy Bass Wyden, the owner, “did not want to spend money on anything—she
    was blocking ordering acrylics, bottles of hand sanitizer, boxes of masks.”

    with management, Bass Wyden found the money for personal protective equipment
    and cleaning materials after all. “Now, it feels safe, but that took weeks and
    weeks of pointing out to management that they were not adhering to their own safety
    plan, filed with the state department of health,” Bobrowski, who has worked at
    the Strand for nearly eighteen years, said. “It took over a month to finally be
    able to say, ‘Yes, it’s as safe as it can be.’”

    that the National Labor Relations Board has lent to employers who want to deflect
    health and safety-related complaints—their union, Local 2179 of the United Auto
    Workers, says that there simply aren’t enough workers currently employed in the
    store for business to be conducted safely. At the beginning of the pandemic, Bass
    Wyden [laid off 188 employees](https://gothamist.com/arts-entertainment/strand-lays-188-employees-pauses-all-business-response-coronavirus),
    stating her intention to hire them back as soon as it was financially possible
    to do so. In July, after rehiring about thirty-three union members, [a dozen were
    laid off again](https://gothamist.com/arts-entertainment/strand-lays-some-recently-rehired-employees-it-prepares-open-uws-location).
    There are now so few people working in the Strand stores—the main location, just
    south of Union Square, and the new location, just opened on the Upper West Side—that
    the few non-union supervisors who remain are being scheduled to cover tasks that,
    under the union contract, ought to be done by union workers.

    the workers she employs, one centered on the future of the Strand itself. Even
    as floor managers and supervisors are having to pick up extra work to cover for
    missing union workers, union members say that Bass Wyden has cleared her business
    almost entirely of the layer of upper management that once stood between her and
    the union. “She used the pandemic to, basically, clean house of management,” Bill
    Magee, a laid-off Strand worker who’d been employed at the store since 2013, told
    me. “Nancy is running things in a way that she hasn’t before. There used to be
    people to push back.”

    unionized in 1976.) But tensions have really been building since Fred Bass, who
    inherited the business from his father, died in 2018, leaving behind a $25 million
    estate. “Fred at least had open animosity with us, and we had animosity with him.
    With Nancy, we’re dealing with a senator’s wife, so it’s a lot more complicated,”
    Graves continued. Bass Wyden is married to Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, who, as
    it happens, is pushing for [more transparency](https://www.bizjournals.com/portland/news/2020/06/16/wyden-legislation-seeks-covid-relief-transparency.html)

    to retain 212 jobs. Given that those jobs were not actually protected, workers
    in the store want to know where the money went. According to Bobrowski, Bass Wyden
    said in a meeting with union stewards in August that she was spending her own
    money to keep the business afloat. But since early April, federal records show,
    she’s also bought between $3 million and almost $7.9 million in stock—Senate financial
    filings, which include spouses’ records, show a range of values, not specific
    amounts—investing heavily in tech (between $112,007 and $300,000 in Alphabet/Google,
    between $175,007 and $450,000 in Apple, and between $110,005 and $300,000 in Facebook),
    fossil fuels (between $15,001 and $50,000 in Exxon Mobil and between $2,002 and
    $30,000 in Royal Dutch Shell), and medical supplies (between $50,001 and $100,000
    in 3M).

    between $220,010 and $600,000 in Amazon stock. Just last year, she had publicly
    lamented the news of Amazon’s intention to open a second headquarters in New York
    City. “Unless we stop them, local and state politicians will continue to advantage
    Big Tech over longstanding local businesses,” she [wrote](https://www.cnn.com/2019/01/08/opinions/amazon-big-tech-threat-cities-bass-wyden/index.html)

    including all benefits and taxes. Bass Wyden’s stock transactions in July alone
    were thus equivalent to employing between 113 and 300 workers. “She’s saying,
    ‘There’s no money, things are tough,’” Bobrowski told me. “But no, she’s spending
    her own money on an enormous stock buying binge, including Amazon, who is our
    competitor, who she has spoken out about publicly.”

    heard in the recent public hearing of the U.S. House antitrust subcommittee, Amazon’s
    ongoing business practices have created monopoly-like conditions in a number of
    industries, including the book industry,” Dan Cullen, a spokesperson for the American
    Booksellers Association, wrote to me in an email. “Indie bookstores are nimble
    and innovative, and have responded to the threat posed by Amazon by offering community,
    connection, and unparalleled knowledge about books and authors. However, the pandemic
    has created conditions that severely restrict independent bookstores’ ability
    to offer the in-person experiences that set them apart.”

    interested in running a bookstore at all; instead, it seems that she is more driven
    to leverage the Strand’s independent history into building a boutique brand, and
    she is taking the pandemic as an opportunity to do so. “Her dream is to expand,
    expand, expand, to promote merchandise rather than books,” Cassandra Baim, a former
    Strand employee who started as a regular bookseller and then worked in visual
    merchandising until 2017, said. “She’s really into the idea of branding herself
    and the Strand, what she thinks is a cohesive Strand brand. To what extent she
    knows how to do that, I’m not sure.”

    many shelves to put up merchandise. Eighteen miles of books? I’m sure we’ve lost
    miles of books.”

    Nancy knew the degree to which we were upset about the things that were happening,”
    Colon said. “Because she was there, because it was opening day—we were approaching
    them as they were opening, the line of people waiting to get in, and she was there
    to greet them. The fact that we got to spoil that, to let her know how upset we
    are, I felt like it went really well.”

    disrupt their former boss’s big day. “In terms of leverage, we’re not in a great
    spot right now,” he said. “At the same time, we’re the only ones who can push
    back on what’s going on.” Without leverage—without workers pushing back—the Strand
    that is left in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic will look less like a bookstore
    and more like yet another luxury souvenir shop for those visiting the world’s
