    famous purveyor of literary tchotchkes, the Strand, posted images of a pair of
    face masks to Instagram. One bore the store’s iconic logo; the other a quote often
    found on merchandise sold in the store: “A well-read woman is a dangerous creature.”
    For every mask purchased, a dollar would be donated to an anti-poverty nonprofit.
    Almost immediately, the masks sold out. This turned out to be unfortunate, as
    workers at the store could have used them a few weeks later.'

    每售出一款口罩，将捐赠一美元给一个反贫困非营利组织。几乎立刻，这些口罩就卖光了。这事后来被证明是不幸的，因为商店的工人几周后就可以用到这些口罩了。

    in the store want to know where the money went. According to Bobrowski, Bass Wyden
    said in a meeting with union stewards in August that she was spending her own
    money to keep the business afloat. But since early April, federal records show,
    she’s also bought between $3 million and almost $7.9 million in stock—Senate financial
    filings, which include spouses’ records, show a range of values, not specific
    amounts—investing heavily in tech (between $112,007 and $300,000 in Alphabet/Google,

    $3 百万到近 $7.9 百万之间的股票—参议院的财务文件显示了一系列数值，而不是具体金额—她在科技领域进行了大量投资（在 Alphabet/Google
