- en: GE is a mythic corporation. It was at one time the largest, most powerful company
    in the world. Its founding story includes the innovator Thomas Edison and financier
    J.P. Morgan. Its legendary CEO Jack Welch, who wrote five bestselling books on
    leadership, became a model for an entire generation of executives. When GE started
    using Microsoft software in our early days, that gave us a huge boost in the market,
    because GE was such a bellwether company.

  zh: GE 是一个神话般的公司。曾经是世界上最大、最强大的公司之一。其创始故事包括创新家托马斯·爱迪生和金融家J.P.摩根。其传奇CEO杰克·韦尔奇，撰写了五本畅销的领导力著作，成为整整一代高管的榜样。当GE在早期开始使用微软软件时，这给了我们市场上巨大的推动力，因为GE是如此具有标志性的公司。
- en: It turns out that the word “mythic” is the perfect word for GE. The corporation
    has come crashing to Earth in one of the greatest downfalls in business history.
    Its workforce has been hollowed out, from 333,000 employees in 2017 to fewer than
    174,000 at the end of last year. Its share price has fallen precipitously. In
    2018, GE was dropped from the Dow Jones Industrial Average after more than a century
    in the index.

  zh: 结果证明，“神话”这个词对GE来说是一个完美的词。这家公司在商业史上经历了最大的崩溃之一。其员工人数已经被削减，从2017年的33.3万人减少到去年底不到17.4万人。其股价急剧下跌。2018年，GE被从道琼斯工业平均指数中剔除，这是该指数上市一个多世纪以来的第一次。
- en: GE’s fall is not the result of innovators developing a better jet engine or
    wind turbine. It’s also not a case of outright fraud, like Enron. It’s a textbook
    case of mismanagement of an overly complex business.

  zh: GE 的衰落不是因为有创新者开发了更好的喷气发动机或风力涡轮机。这也不是一个像安然那样的明显欺诈案例。这是一个过度复杂的业务管理不善的典型案例。

    namesake bank). I wish I could tell you that I was one of them, but I was just
    as surprised as most people.

- en: 'That’s why I was eager to read *Lights Out: Pride, Delusion, and the Fall of
    General Electric*, by the *Wall Street Journal* reporters Thomas Gryta and Ted
    Mann. I wanted to understand what really went wrong and what lessons this story
    holds for investors, regulators, business leaders, and business students.'

  zh: 这就是为什么我迫不及待地阅读了《熄灯：通用电气的傲慢、幻想和衰落》，作者是《华尔街日报》的记者托马斯·格里塔和泰德·曼。我想了解到底出了什么问题，这个故事对投资者、监管机构、商业领袖和商学院学生有什么教训。
- en: At times, it was a bit hard for me, as a former CEO, to read such harsh criticism
    of fellow leaders, including people I know and like. But I got a lot out of reading
    this book. Gryta and Mann gave me the detailed insight I was looking for into
    the culture, decisions, and accounting that eventually caught up to GE in a gigantic
    way.

  zh: 有时候，作为一位前CEO，读到对同行领导者的如此严厉批评还是有点困难，包括我认识和喜欢的人。但我从阅读这本书中受益匪浅。格里塔和曼为我提供了我想要的对GE文化、决策和会计的详细洞察，最终以巨大的方式追溯到了GE身上。
- en: My first big takeaway is that one of GE’s greatest apparent strengths was actually
    one of its greatest weaknesses. For many years, investors loved GE’s stock because
    the GE management team always “made their numbers”—that is, the company produced
    earnings per share at least as large as what Wall Street analysts predicted. It
    turns out that culture of making the numbers at all costs gave rise to “success
    theater” and “chasing earnings.” In Gryta and Mann’s words, “Problems [were] hidden
    for the sake of preserving performance, thus allowing small problems to become
    big problems before they were detected.”

  zh: 我的第一个重要收获是，GE最显著的优势之一实际上却是其最大的弱点之一。多年来，投资者喜爱GE的股票，因为GE管理团队总是“实现预期数字”，也就是说，公司的每股收益至少与华尔街分析师预测的一样多。事实证明，以牺牲一切来达成数字的文化催生了“成功剧场”和“追逐利润”。用格里塔和曼的话来说，“问题被隐藏起来，以保持绩效，从而使得小问题在被发现之前变成了大问题。”
- en: Chapter 14 of *Lights Out* details many of the gimmicks GE employed to make
    the numbers look better than they really were. For example, Gryta and Mann report
    that GE would sometimes artificially boost quarterly profits by selling an asset
    (e.g., a diesel train) to a friendly bank, knowing that it could then buy back
    the asset at a time of GE’s choosing.

  zh: 《灯火已尽》第14章详细介绍了通用电气为使数字看起来比实际情况更好而采用的许多花招。例如，Gryta和Mann报道说，通用电气有时会通过向友好银行出售资产（例如柴油火车）来人为提高季度利润，因为它知道可以在通用电气选择的时间买回资产。
- en: There are a lot of ways a company can end up with a culture that rewards gaming
    the numbers. Although Steve Ballmer and I made our share of strategic mistakes,
    we were maniacal about making sure our numbers were rock solid and avoiding incentive
    systems where people could cram a lot of sales into a quarter in order to look
    good or meet some quota. Satya Nadella works the same way today.

  zh: 一个公司可能以奖励数字操纵的文化结构收场。虽然史蒂夫·鲍尔默和我都犯过战略性错误，但我们对确保数字可靠性和避免人们可以在一个季度内塞满大量销售以显示出色或达到某个配额的激励系统非常狂热。萨蒂亚·纳德拉今天也是这样做的。
- en: In many companies, bad news travels very slowly, while good news travels fast.
    We tried hard to combat that. A team member might send me mail saying “we just
    won a software design competition,” and “isn’t this amazing?” I’d typically respond,
    “Why am I hearing about this one? That’s not statistically representative. How
    many competitions did we lose?” I used the term “making bad news travel fast”
    all the time. I wanted to catch negative trends early, when we could still do
    something about them.

  zh: 在许多公司中，坏消息传播得很慢，而好消息传播得很快。我们努力抵制这种情况。团队成员可能会给我发邮件说“我们刚赢得了一个软件设计比赛”，“这太棒了，对吧？”我通常会回答，“我为什么现在才知道这个消息？这并不具有统计代表性。我们输了多少场比赛？”我经常使用“让坏消息传播得更快”的术语。我希望早点发现负面趋势，这样我们还能采取一些措施。
- en: My second big takeaway from *Lights Out* is that GE didn’t have the right talent
    and systems to bundle together a dizzying array of unrelated businesses—including
    moviemaking, insurance, plastics, and nuclear power plants—and manage them well.
    Investors bought into the notion that the company’s world-renowned training made
    it better at managing things than anyone else, and that GE could produce consistent
    profits even in highly cyclical markets. And GE successfully persuaded people
    that its generalists could avoid the pitfalls that had tripped up big conglomerates
    in the past.

  zh: 我从《灯火已尽》中获得的第二个重要启示是，通用电气公司（GE）没有正确的人才和系统来捆绑一系列毫不相关的业务，包括电影制作、保险、塑料和核电厂，并有效地管理它们。投资者相信这家公司世界闻名的培训使其在管理方面优于其他任何公司，而且通用电气可以在高度周期性的市场中产生稳定的利润。通用电气成功地说服人们，其综合人才可以避免过去许多大型企业集团曾经遭遇的陷阱。
- en: In reality, those generalists often didn’t understand the specifics of the industries
    they had to manage and couldn’t navigate trends in their industries. For example,
    the authors make the case that CEO Jeff Immelt didn’t have a good handle on its
    huge banking unit, GE Capital. “Making money from [GE Capital] seemed shockingly
    simple to him at first, as it had to Welch, but the balance sheets were treacherously
    complex, and deep risks lurked there and were not always easily spotted in the
    quarterly profits and losses,” write Gryta and Mann. One former GE executive told
    the authors that “Immelt struggled with basic concepts—the difference between
    secured and unsecured debt, for instance, which was fundamental to a lending operation
    like GE Capital.”

  zh: 实际上，这些综合人员经常不了解他们必须管理的行业的具体情况，也无法应对其行业的趋势。例如，作者们认为CEO杰夫·伊梅尔特对其庞大的银行业务部门通用电气资本的掌握并不好。“从通用电气资本赚钱对他来说一开始似乎很简单，就像对韦尔奇一样，但资产负债表非常复杂，深层次的风险潜藏其中，并不总是容易在季度利润和损失中发现，”Gryta和Mann写道。一位前通用电气高管告诉作者，“伊梅尔特在基本概念上有困难——例如，担保和无担保债务之间的区别，这对于像通用电气资本这样的贷款业务来说是基础性的。”
- en: This dynamic was not confined to Immelt. It was rampant throughout the company’s
    top ranks. As a result, the ability of top executives to understand what was really
    going on was quite limited. The only people who could actually dig down into the
    numbers and see what was going on were in finance. And as I mentioned above, the
    finance people didn’t have much incentive to bring negative news to Welch or Immelt.

  zh: 这种动态并不局限于伊梅尔特。这种情况在公司高层蔓延。因此，高管了解真实情况的能力相当有限。实际上能深入了解数字并了解真实情况的只有财务部门。正如我上面提到的，财务人员没有太大的动力将负面消息告诉韦尔奇或伊梅尔特。
- en: In my role at our foundation, I sometimes hear fellow philanthropists say things
    like, “I just wish my grantees could operate more like a business.” The story
    of GE, led by very smart men who cared deeply about their work, should tamp down
    that kind of talk. The truth is that businesses, even the giants of industry,
    are just as susceptible to mistakes as any nonprofit. Anyone who wants to avoid
    the mistakes made by GE should read this book.

  zh: 在我们基金会的职责中，我有时会听到一些志同道合的慈善家说：“我只希望我的资助对象能更像一家企业。” 通用电气（GE）的故事，由非常聪明、对工作深感热情的人领导，应该能够遏制这种说法。事实是，即使是工业巨头，企业也同样容易犯错，就像任何非营利组织一样。任何想要避免通用电气所犯错误的人都应该读一读这本书。
