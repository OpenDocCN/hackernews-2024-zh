    SpaceX illegally fired a group of employees [for drafting an open letter](/2022/6/16/23170228/spacex-elon-musk-internal-open-letter-behavior)
    that criticized Musk’s behavior. The NLRB also claims SpaceX interrogated employees
    about their involvement with the letter and encouraged employees to quit if they
    participated in organized activities.

- en: Now, SpaceX is responding with a lawsuit that says the open letter was a “distraction
    to SpaceX employees around the country.” It claims the NLRB’s proceedings, which
    involve a hearing in front of an NLRB administrative law judge (ALJ), violate
    SpaceX’s “constitutional right to trial by jury.” The company also accuses NLRB
    of violating the Constitution’s rules on the separation of powers, stating the
    agency’s structure “is miles away from the traditional understanding” of the concept.
    The NLRB declined to comment.

    NLRB members and ALJs unconstitutional, as well as declare that the NLRB’s proceedings
    deprive SpaceX of its right to trial. It’s also asking the court to pause the
    current proceedings. A hearing is scheduled in front of an NLRB ALJ on March 5th,
    2024, but there’s an option to appeal the decision to the board and then a federal
    appeals court.
