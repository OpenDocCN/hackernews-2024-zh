- en: Lumber companies began pushing up the California coast after the gold rushes
    of the eighteen-forties and fifties. Enormous redwoods in the state’s upper reaches
    had trunks nearly twenty feet around, and it could take several days for two men
    to chop a single one down. When logging season was over, the men who did this
    work often decamped to single-room-occupancy hotels in San Francisco and Portland—the
    stereotype of a lumberjack was a man “who works for a season, comes back to town,
    blows his whole wad on booze and women,” the historian James Michael Buckley told
    me.

  zh: 木材公司在十八世纪四十年代和五十年代的淘金热之后开始沿着加利福尼亚海岸线推进。该州上部的巨大红木树干几乎有20英尺粗，两个人砍倒一棵树可能需要几天时间。在伐木季结束时，从事这项工作的人经常前往旧金山和波特兰的单间旅馆—历史学家詹姆斯·迈克尔·巴克利告诉我，一个伐木工的刻板印象是一个“工作一个季度，回到城里，把整个钱包花在酒和女人身上”的人。
- en: In 1863, Henry Wetherbee and A. W. McPherson bought six thousand acres along
    the Eel River and formed the Pacific Lumber Company, building its first mill on
    the land about two decades later. Pacific Lumber wanted a steady and reputable
    workforce, so the company planned a housing settlement on the land and christened
    it Scotia. The company bought farms and began raising its own cattle and pigs;
    it opened a saloon, where it could control the sale of liquor. Eventually, there
    was a bank, a fire department, and a school. Scotia even had its own currency,
    good for use at the company store, well into the twentieth century. There were
    company-hosted picnics with barbecues and sack races and softball games. At Thanksgiving,
    Pacific Lumber gave out frozen turkeys to every employee, and, at Christmas, the
    company bought presents for the children in town, traditions that residents still
    remember. People I spoke to recalled receiving a gift of the board game Life or
    a packet of butter balls.

  zh: 1863年，亨利·韦瑟比（Henry Wetherbee）和A·W·麦克弗森（A. W. McPherson）购买了紧邻伊尔河（Eel River）的六千英亩土地，组建了太平洋木材公司，大约二十年后在该地建立了第一座磨坊。太平洋木材公司希望拥有一支稳定而受人尊敬的劳动力，因此该公司计划在土地上建立一个住房定居点，并将其命名为斯科舍亚。公司购买了农场，并开始养殖自己的牛和猪；它开了一家酒吧，可以控制酒水的销售。最终，这里有了一家银行、一个消防局和一所学校。直到二十世纪初，斯科舍亚甚至还拥有自己的货币，可以在公司商店使用。公司举办的野餐活动包括烧烤、袋子比赛和垒球比赛。感恩节时，太平洋木材公司为每个员工赠送冷冻火鸡，圣诞节时，公司为镇上的儿童购买礼物，居民们至今仍然记得这些传统。我采访的人们回忆起收到了生活棋盘游戏或一包黄油球。
- en: Many company towns compelled conformity through violence, but Pacific Lumber
    came to depend, to an unusual degree, on perks. According to Buckley, in the nineteen-twenties,
    workers paid just a dollar a month for access to medical services; those who suffered
    accidents or fell ill would visit a company health clinic and receive timely treatment.
    The company’s pension plan, introduced in the nineteen-forties, enrolled workers
    after two years, mandated retirement at sixty-five, and paid, on average, three-quarters
    of its workers’ retirement costs.

  zh: 许多公司城镇通过暴力强迫一致性，但是太平洋木材公司依赖福利的程度异常高。据巴克利称，在二十世纪二十年代，工人每月仅需支付一美元就可以获得医疗服务；那些遭受事故或患病的人会去公司的健康诊所接受及时治疗。公司的养老金计划于二十世纪四十年代推出，工人在两年后就被纳入计划，规定在六十五岁退休，并支付其工人退休费用的四分之三左右。
- en: Nothing was subsidized more heavily than rent. In 1951, a three-bedroom house
    in Scotia, including utilities, cost twenty-one dollars a month, equal to about
    two hundred and fifty dollars today. Rent was so cheap that, sometime around the
    nineteen-seventies, the I.R.S. warned Pacific Lumber that it would begin treating
    it as a taxable employee benefit if the company didn’t raise rates to a range
    within market value.

  zh: 没有比租金补贴更大的了。1951年，包括水电在内的斯科舍亚的三卧室住房每月花费21美元，相当于今天的约250美元。租金如此便宜，以至于大约在二十世纪七十年代左右，美国国内税务局警告太平洋木材公司，如果该公司不将价格提高到市场价范围内，将开始将其视为应税员工福利。
- en: Pacific Lumber also set aside money for the college tuition of its employees’
    children. Some sources suggest that the company offered as much as eight thousand
    dollars a year in aid, at a time when college didn’t cost what it does now. “Took
    care of the family, took care of the kids,” John Broadstock, a longtime resident
    who served as Scotia’s fire chief for two decades, told me. “All three of my boys
    got the college scholarship. They put them through school.” Although corporate
    good will may have contributed to this approach, the overarching principle was
    maximizing profit. “Scotia was like a test case,” Buckley, the historian, told
    me. “How much can we spend on worker welfare and still make money?”

  zh: 太平洋木材公司还为其员工的孩子们的大学学费留了钱。一些消息来源表明，公司提供的援助达到每年八千美元，当时大学的费用还不像现在这么贵。“照顾家庭，照顾孩子，”长期居民约翰·布罗德斯托克告诉我，他在斯科西亚担任消防队长达二十年之久。“我的三个孩子都获得了大学奖学金。他们让他们上学。”尽管公司的善意可能有助于这种做法，但主要原则是最大化利润。“斯科西亚就像一个测试案例，”历史学家巴克利告诉我。“我们可以为工人福利花多少钱，还能赚到钱？”
- en: As the century progressed, and other large companies provided less and less
    for their employees, Scotia became an outlier. Tens of thousands of visitors began
    coming each year to gawk at the strange little town that flew a Pacific Lumber
    flag next to the American flag on Main Street. More people wanted to live in Scotia
    than there were beds in the town; in 1951, the *Saturday Evening Post* ran a story
    about it, under the headline “Paradise with a Waiting List.” By 1981, the waiting
    list reportedly stretched two full years.

  zh: 随着世纪的发展，其他大公司为员工提供的越来越少，斯科西亚成为了一个异常。成千上万的游客每年涌入这个奇怪的小镇，在主街上的美国国旗旁边飘着太平洋木材公司的旗帜。更多的人想在斯科西亚定居，而镇上的床位不够用；1951年，《星期六晚邮报》发表了一篇关于此的报道，标题为“等待名单上的天堂”。到1981年，据报道，等待名单已延续了整整两年。
- en: Johnny Valencia came to town eight years later. He was born in Eureka, about
    a half hour north, in 1971, and grew up in nearby Fortuna. The year he turned
    eighteen, he got a job in the *PALCO* mill and worked there for seventeen years;
    he was laid off just before the company went bankrupt. He took the Postal Service
    exam and six years ago he was assigned to the Scotia office.

  zh: 约翰尼·瓦伦西亚八年后来到了小镇。他1971年出生于尤里卡，北部约半小时的路程，在附近的福图纳长大。他十八岁那年，他在*PALCO*工厂找到了一份工作，在那里工作了十七年；就在公司破产之前他被裁员。他参加了邮政考试，六年前被分配到了斯科西亚办公室。
- en: I spent about an hour with him there meeting residents. Then Valencia told me
    I should come back in the morning, at ten, when a man named Lonnie Dollarhide
    would drop in to pick up his mail. Dollarhide arrived on cue, with a baseball
    cap over close-cropped white hair. He said that he’d moved to Scotia in the nineteen-sixties,
    when the sidewalks were still made of redwood. He worked in the kiln for more
    than forty years; when *PALCO* went under, he got a job at the Humboldt Redwood
    Company, which took over a large share of *PALCO*’s remaining lumber business,
    and still operates in town, albeit with a fraction of the old workforce. Dollarhide
    recalled the pristine lawns of Scotia in its prime. Residents, he explained, were
    expected to maintain their yards; if they didn’t, Pacific Lumber sent maintenance
    crews to cut their grass, then deducted the cost from their next paycheck. “It
    was the best place to live,” he said.

  zh: 我在那儿花了大约一个小时和他见了面，见了几位居民。然后瓦伦西亚告诉我，我应该在早上十点再回来，因为一个叫洛尼·达拉赫德的人会在那时来拿他的邮件。达拉赫德准时到达，戴着一顶戴着短裁白发的棒球帽。他说他在上世纪六十年代搬到了斯科西亚，那时人行道还是红木制成的。他在窑炉工作了四十多年；当*PALCO*破产时，他在洪堡红木公司找到了一份工作，后者接管了*PALCO*剩余的大部分木材业务，并仍在该镇运营，尽管人员规模仅为过去的一小部分。达拉赫德回忆起斯科西亚鼎盛时期的原始草坪。他解释说，居民们应该维护自己的院子；如果他们不这样做，太平洋木材公司会派维护人员来修剪他们的草坪，然后从他们的下一份工资中扣除成本。“这是最好的地方，”他说。

- en: Manicured lawns weren’t the only things aggressively enforced in Scotia. Anyone
    who had ever belonged to a union was placed on a blacklist that was distributed
    among lumber companies. (Pacific Lumber employees were not unionized.) Workers
    who expressed Socialist leanings were summarily fired. In the nineteen-twenties,
    an employee compared Pacific Lumber to the “feudal barons of old,” writing, in
    the Eureka-based *Labor News*, “There is no way to avoid the tentacles of the
    corporation as every foot of ground and all the material of every description
    is owned by the company.” Even so, the steady pay and affordable housing seem
    to have kept most employees satisfied. In 1922, an organizer with the I.W.W. complained,
    of Scotia’s residents, that “it would take a Sherlock Holmes to find any militancy
    in these tame apes.”

  zh: 在斯科舍亚（Scotia），修剪整齐的草坪并不是唯一受到强制执行的事情。任何曾经加入工会的人都被列入了一个黑名单，该黑名单在木材公司间流传。（太平洋木材公司的员工没有组成工会。）表达社会主义倾向的工人被立即解雇。在二十世纪二十年代，一名员工将太平洋木材公司比作“古老的封建领主”，在以尤里卡为基地的《劳工新闻》（*Labor
    News*）上写道，“无论如何，都无法躲避公司的触角，因为每一寸土地和各种材料都归公司所有。”即便如此，稳定的工资和负担得起的住房似乎让大多数员工满意。1922年，一名工人组织国际（I.W.W.）的组织者抱怨斯科舍亚的居民，“要找到这些温顺的猿类中的任何激进分子都需要一位夏洛克·福尔摩斯。”
