- en: Lumber companies began pushing up the California coast after the gold rushes
    of the eighteen-forties and fifties. Enormous redwoods in the state’s upper reaches
    had trunks nearly twenty feet around, and it could take several days for two men
    to chop a single one down. When logging season was over, the men who did this
    work often decamped to single-room-occupancy hotels in San Francisco and Portland—the
    stereotype of a lumberjack was a man “who works for a season, comes back to town,
    blows his whole wad on booze and women,” the historian James Michael Buckley told
    me.

- en: In 1863, Henry Wetherbee and A. W. McPherson bought six thousand acres along
    the Eel River and formed the Pacific Lumber Company, building its first mill on
    the land about two decades later. Pacific Lumber wanted a steady and reputable
    workforce, so the company planned a housing settlement on the land and christened
    it Scotia. The company bought farms and began raising its own cattle and pigs;
    it opened a saloon, where it could control the sale of liquor. Eventually, there
    was a bank, a fire department, and a school. Scotia even had its own currency,
    good for use at the company store, well into the twentieth century. There were
    company-hosted picnics with barbecues and sack races and softball games. At Thanksgiving,
    Pacific Lumber gave out frozen turkeys to every employee, and, at Christmas, the
    company bought presents for the children in town, traditions that residents still
    remember. People I spoke to recalled receiving a gift of the board game Life or
    a packet of butter balls.

- en: Many company towns compelled conformity through violence, but Pacific Lumber
    came to depend, to an unusual degree, on perks. According to Buckley, in the nineteen-twenties,
    workers paid just a dollar a month for access to medical services; those who suffered
    accidents or fell ill would visit a company health clinic and receive timely treatment.
    The company’s pension plan, introduced in the nineteen-forties, enrolled workers
    after two years, mandated retirement at sixty-five, and paid, on average, three-quarters
    of its workers’ retirement costs.

- en: Nothing was subsidized more heavily than rent. In 1951, a three-bedroom house
    in Scotia, including utilities, cost twenty-one dollars a month, equal to about
    two hundred and fifty dollars today. Rent was so cheap that, sometime around the
    nineteen-seventies, the I.R.S. warned Pacific Lumber that it would begin treating
    it as a taxable employee benefit if the company didn’t raise rates to a range
    within market value.

- en: Pacific Lumber also set aside money for the college tuition of its employees’
    children. Some sources suggest that the company offered as much as eight thousand
    dollars a year in aid, at a time when college didn’t cost what it does now. “Took
    care of the family, took care of the kids,” John Broadstock, a longtime resident
    who served as Scotia’s fire chief for two decades, told me. “All three of my boys
    got the college scholarship. They put them through school.” Although corporate
    good will may have contributed to this approach, the overarching principle was
    maximizing profit. “Scotia was like a test case,” Buckley, the historian, told
    me. “How much can we spend on worker welfare and still make money?”

- en: As the century progressed, and other large companies provided less and less
    for their employees, Scotia became an outlier. Tens of thousands of visitors began
    coming each year to gawk at the strange little town that flew a Pacific Lumber
    flag next to the American flag on Main Street. More people wanted to live in Scotia
    than there were beds in the town; in 1951, the *Saturday Evening Post* ran a story
    about it, under the headline “Paradise with a Waiting List.” By 1981, the waiting
    list reportedly stretched two full years.

- en: Johnny Valencia came to town eight years later. He was born in Eureka, about
    a half hour north, in 1971, and grew up in nearby Fortuna. The year he turned
    eighteen, he got a job in the *PALCO* mill and worked there for seventeen years;
    he was laid off just before the company went bankrupt. He took the Postal Service
    exam and six years ago he was assigned to the Scotia office.

- en: I spent about an hour with him there meeting residents. Then Valencia told me
    I should come back in the morning, at ten, when a man named Lonnie Dollarhide
    would drop in to pick up his mail. Dollarhide arrived on cue, with a baseball
    cap over close-cropped white hair. He said that he’d moved to Scotia in the nineteen-sixties,
    when the sidewalks were still made of redwood. He worked in the kiln for more
    than forty years; when *PALCO* went under, he got a job at the Humboldt Redwood
    Company, which took over a large share of *PALCO*’s remaining lumber business,
    and still operates in town, albeit with a fraction of the old workforce. Dollarhide
    recalled the pristine lawns of Scotia in its prime. Residents, he explained, were
    expected to maintain their yards; if they didn’t, Pacific Lumber sent maintenance
    crews to cut their grass, then deducted the cost from their next paycheck. “It
    was the best place to live,” he said.

- en: Manicured lawns weren’t the only things aggressively enforced in Scotia. Anyone
    who had ever belonged to a union was placed on a blacklist that was distributed
    among lumber companies. (Pacific Lumber employees were not unionized.) Workers
    who expressed Socialist leanings were summarily fired. In the nineteen-twenties,
    an employee compared Pacific Lumber to the “feudal barons of old,” writing, in
    the Eureka-based *Labor News*, “There is no way to avoid the tentacles of the
    corporation as every foot of ground and all the material of every description
    is owned by the company.” Even so, the steady pay and affordable housing seem
    to have kept most employees satisfied. In 1922, an organizer with the I.W.W. complained,
    of Scotia’s residents, that “it would take a Sherlock Holmes to find any militancy
    in these tame apes.”
