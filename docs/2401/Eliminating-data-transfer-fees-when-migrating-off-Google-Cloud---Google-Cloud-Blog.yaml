    secure, and interoperable. When customers’ business needs evolve, the cloud should
    be flexible enough to accommodate those changes.

- en: Starting today, Google Cloud customers who wish to stop using Google Cloud and
    migrate their data to another cloud provider and/or on premises, can take advantage
    of free network data transfer to migrate their data out of Google Cloud. This
    applies to all customers globally. You can learn more [here](https://cloud.google.com/exit-cloud).

    for customers to change their cloud provider; however, it does not solve the fundamental
    issue that prevents many customers from working with their preferred cloud provider
    in the first place: restrictive and unfair licensing practices.'

    cloud monopolies, using restrictive licensing practices that lock in customers
    and warp competition.

    who their customers can work with and how; charging [5x the cost](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/azure-vs-aws/cost-savings/?activetab=pivot:windowsservertab)
    if customers decide to use certain competitors’ clouds; and limiting interoperability
    of must-have software with competitors’ cloud infrastructure. These and other
    restrictions have no technical basis and may impose a [300% cost increase](https://cispe.cloud/website_cispe/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Quantification-of-Cost-of-Unfair-Software-Licensing_Prof-Jenny_-June-2023_web.pdf)
    to customers. In contrast, the cost for customers to migrate data out of a cloud
    provider is minimal.

- en: Making it easier for customers to move from one provider to another does little
    to improve choice if customers remain locked in with restrictive licenses. Customers
    should choose a cloud provider because it makes sense for their business, not
    because their legacy provider has locked them in with overly restrictive contracting
    terms or punitive licensing practices.

    customers — many of whom raise concerns about legacy providers’ licensing restrictions
    directly with us. Much more must be done to end the restrictive licensing practices
    that are the true barrier to customer choice and competition in the cloud market.
