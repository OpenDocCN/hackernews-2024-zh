    a massive underground stockpile based in Amarillo, Texas, that supplies up to
    30% of the country’s helium.

    suddenly power down across the country, said Soumi Saha, senior vice president
    of government affairs at Premier Inc., which contracts with helium suppliers on
    behalf of 4,400 hospitals in the U.S. “But we are stressing about this shortage.
    From a health care perspective, MRI machines are the No. 1 concern.”

    The superconductive magnet-powered imaging machines give doctors clear, high-resolution
    images of areas inside the body they can’t see on X-rays and CT scans. But without
    liquid helium, the Earth’s coldest element, MRI machines can’t keep their magnets

    as long as three years, said Rich Gottwald, CEO of the Compressed Gas Association,

    and sell it tohospitals, semiconductor manufacturers, NASA and other customers.

    didn’t need to reconcile state-specific rules, but a private buyer would, he said.
    Another issue is that helium must be enriched before it can be used, and a separate
    system is needed to do that. That enrichment system isn’t part of the federal
    reserve, but is privately owned by four private companies, including Messer; unlike
    the pipelines and helium itself, it wasn’t for sale.

    or build their own unit to enrich the helium,” Gottwald said. “There’s a whole
    host of issues that need to be resolved and the concern is, until they’re resolved,
    the system will need to shut down.”

    It was initially supposed to occur in 2021, but a series of delays — in part due

    the auction to Thursday.

    own solutions. Both Philips and Siemens Healthineers recently started selling
    alternatives to traditional MRI machines, which hold 1,700 to 1,800 liters of

    1 to 7 liters of helium and don’t need any replenishment. Spokespeople from both
