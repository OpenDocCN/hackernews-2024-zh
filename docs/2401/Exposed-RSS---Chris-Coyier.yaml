- en: I get sites not having an “RSS” for “Feed” link on their website while actually
    having an RSS feed. I don’t like it, but I get it. Maybe they picked an off-the-shelf
    theme that doesn’t have that. Maybe they just forgot. Maybe they even don’t want
    to.

    to help [browsers and other software to automatically find a site’s RSS feed](https://www.rssboard.org/rss-autodiscovery).

    use to automatically find a feed when you paste in a URL. If you have an RSS feed,
    you should have the following in the `head` of your website:'

    site has a feed and I want to subscribe to it, I just chuck your homepage URL
    into my feed reader “Add” function and let it find what it needs. If it doesn’t
    find one I’m like *oh well bummer*.

    sure you’ve got that `<link>` tag in place or anybody like me will assume you
    don’t even have one.
