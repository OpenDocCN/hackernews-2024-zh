# Who wrote the CIA ‘sabotaging meetings’ guide and why?

Well, it wasn’t actually the CIA.

It was written by the OSS, the predecessor to the Central Intelligence Agency, who created it during the run up to the Second World War, to instruct and guide sympathetic Axis citizens to stir up sh*t (technical phrase).

The general idea was to create chaos at the coal face; empower potential allies and equip disgruntled citizens with the tools to disturb and disrupt businesses and organisations, with an apparent aim to cause rumbling difficulties in the economy.

In an eerie way, this rebellious guidance from nearly 80 years ago (!), resonates strongly today – think [gerrymandering](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-4dIImaodQ) or [deflection](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-38045852).
