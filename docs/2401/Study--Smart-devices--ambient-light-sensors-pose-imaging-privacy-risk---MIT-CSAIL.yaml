    TV-like telescreens to surveil citizens without any cameras. In a similar fashion,
    our current smart devices contain ambient light sensors, which open the door to
    a different threat: hackers.'

  zh: 在乔治·奥威尔的小说《1984年》，大哥通过双向、类似电视机的电视屏幕监视公民，实现对公民的监视而不需要摄像头。同样地，我们当前的智能设备包含环境光传感器，这打开了一个不同威胁的大门：黑客。
- en: These passive, seemingly innocuous smartphone components receive light from
    the environment and adjust the screen's brightness accordingly, like when your
    phone automatically dims in a bright room. Unlike cameras, though, apps are not
    required to ask for permission to use these sensors. In a surprising discovery,
    researchers from MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory
    (CSAIL) uncovered that ambient light sensors are vulnerable to privacy threats
    when embedded on a smart device’s screen. The team proposed a computational imaging
    algorithm to recover an image of the environment from the perspective of the display
    screen using subtle single-point light intensity changes of these sensors to demonstrate
    how hackers could use them in tandem with monitors. An open-access [paper on this
    work](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adj3608) was published in *Science
    Advances* on Jan. 10.

  zh: 这些被动的、看似无害的智能手机组件接收环境光线并相应调节屏幕亮度，就像在明亮的房间里手机自动调暗一样。不过，与摄像头不同的是，应用程序无需请求使用这些传感器的权限。在一项令人惊讶的发现中，麻省理工学院计算机科学与人工智能实验室（CSAIL）的研究人员发现，当环境光传感器嵌入在智能设备的屏幕上时，存在隐私威胁。该团队提出了一种计算成像算法，通过这些传感器微小的单点光强变化，从显示屏的角度恢复环境的图像，以展示黑客如何与监视器配合使用这些传感器。该工作的开放获取[论文](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adj3608)于1月10日发表在*科学进展*上。

    Ambient light sensors are tiny devices deployed in almost all portable devices
    and screens that surround us in our daily lives,” says Princeton University professor
    Felix Heide, who was not involved with the paper. “As such, the authors highlight
    a privacy threat that affects a comprehensive class of devices and has been overlooked
    so far.”

    recording user activity, the MIT group found that ambient light sensors can capture
    images of users’ touch interactions without a camera. According to their new study,
    these sensors can eavesdrop on regular gestures, like scrolling, swiping, or sliding,
    and capture how users interact with their phones while watching videos. For example,
    apps with native access to your screen, including video players and web browsers,
    could spy on you to gather this permission-free data.

- en: According to the researchers, a commonly held belief is that ambient light sensors
    don’t reveal meaningful private information to hackers, so programming apps to
    request access to them is unnecessary. “Many believe that these sensors should
    always be turned on,” says lead author Yang Liu, a PhD student in MIT's Department
    of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science and a CSAIL affiliate. “But much
    like the telescreen, ambient light sensors can passively capture what we’re doing
    without our permission, while apps are required to request access to our cameras.
    Our demonstrations show that when combined with a display screen, these sensors
    could pose some sort of imaging privacy threat by providing that information to
    hackers monitoring your smart devices.”

    light sensor first collects low-bitrate variations in light intensity, partially
    blocked by the hand making contact with the screen. Next, the outputs are mapped
    into a two-dimensional space by forming an inverse problem with the knowledge
    of the screen content. An algorithm then reconstructs the picture from the screen’s
    perspective, which is iteratively optimized and denoised via deep learning to
    reveal a pixelated image of hand activity.

    to reveal a previously unexplored imaging threat that could expose the environment
    in front of the screen to hackers processing the sensor data from another device.
    “This imaging privacy threat has never been demonstrated before,” says Liu, who
    worked alongside Frédo Durand on the paper, who is an MIT EECS professor, CSAIL
    member, and senior author of the paper.

    tightening up permissions and reducing the precision and speed of the sensors.
    First, they recommend restricting access to the ambient light sensor by allowing
    users to approve or deny those requests from apps. To further prevent any privacy
    threats, the team also proposed limiting the capabilities of the sensors. By reducing
    the precision and speed of these components, the sensors would reveal less private
    information. From the hardware side, the ambient light sensor should not be directly
    facing the user on any smart device, they argued, but instead placed on the side,
    where it won’t capture any significant touch interactions.'

    In the first test, the researchers seated a mannequin in front of the device,
    while different hands made contact with the screen. A human hand pointed to the
    screen, and later, a cardboard cutout resembling an open-hand gesture touched
    the monitor, with the pixelated imprints gathered by the MIT team revealing the
    physical interactions with the screen.

    pinch, swipe, and rotate could be gradually captured by hackers through the same
    imaging method, although only at a speed of one frame every 3.3 minutes. With
    a faster ambient light sensor, malicious actors could potentially eavesdrop on
    user interactions with their devices in real time.

    like films and short clips. A human hand hovered in front of the sensor while
    scenes from Tom and Jerry cartoons played on screen, with a white board behind
    the user reflecting light to the device. The ambient light sensor captured the
    subtle intensity changes for each video frame, with the resulting images exposing
    touch gestures.

- en: While the vulnerabilities in ambient light sensors pose a threat, such a hack
    is still restricted. The speed of this privacy issue is low, with the current
    image retrieval rate being 3.3 minutes per frame, which overwhelms the dwell of
    user interactions. Additionally, these pictures are still a bit blurry if retrieved
    from a natural video, potentially leading to future research. While telescreens
    can capture objects away from the screen, this imaging privacy issue is only confirmed
    for objects that make contact with a mobile device’s screen, much like how selfie
    cameras cannot capture objects out of frame.
