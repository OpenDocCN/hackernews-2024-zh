- en: We started seeing some strange devices show up for some of our customers' users.
    These devices would access the same page the user just had around 10 seconds after
    they did, from somewhere quite different.

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We looked at where these requests were coming from places such as AWS in the
    central US, data centers in California and similar locations around the world.
    This could be someone switching on a VPN we thought.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But wait, these are different devices, they have none of the same cookies. If
    this were a VPN it would be the same device.

- en: Seeing a machine hosted in a data center and with all the users we saw coming
    from these locations working for large institutions we thought maybe it is just
    a remote cloud desktop.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We would expect a remote cloud desktop to be most likely Windows, to be comparatively
    speced to a real world desktop and to have similar behaviour to real desktop as
    well.

- en: What we found were user agents purporting to be from a range of devices including
    mobile devices, all only ever loading a single page without any existing state
    like cookies. TLS fingerprints and other factors told us that these were consistently
    using an old version of Chrome.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So far the device doesn’t look like any legitimate user we had ever seen. It
    looked like automation of some kind as most users run a fairly up to date version
    of Chrome and don’t lie about their user agents.
  prefs: []

- en: The behavior itself is also strange, how did it load these pages which were
    often behind an authwall without ever logging in or having auth cookies? That
    seems very odd.

  prefs:

- en: This looks like a security system that randomly scans pages by grabbing the
    page contents, sending it to a render queue and then processing it. This is interesting
    as these pages can contain PII, financial details or other sensitive information
    and they are being processed on versions of Chrome seemingly tens of versions
    out of date, seemingly on a shared instance.

- en: We got [nerd sniped](https://xkcd.com/356/) at this point and wanted to know
    what this system was. It didn’t have any user agent data as that was always forged
    to match the users. It often ran out of AWS or other data centers and it was a
    number of organizations.

    Palo Alto Networks.
