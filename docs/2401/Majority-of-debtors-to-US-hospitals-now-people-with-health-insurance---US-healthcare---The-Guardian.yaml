    and consulting firm that works closely with hospitals and performed [the analysis](https://www.crowe.com/-/media/crowe/llp/widen-media-files-folder/h/hospital-collection-rates-for-self-pay-patient-accounts-report-chc2305-001a.pdf).

    or from patients whose insurance required out-of-pocket payments, according to

    to 57.6% of all hospitals’ bad debt.

    to high deductibles has risen in the last decade. There is not a single definition
    for a high-deductible health plan, but typically such plans require a payment
    of [$1,000 or more](https://www.kff.org/report-section/ehbs-2023-section-8-high-deductible-health-plans-with-savings-option/)
    before insurance kicks in for a single person – though costs can soar far above
    that. Because deductibles reset every year, they can be especially punishing for
    chronically ill patients – and they can be far more expensive than $1,000 a year.

- en: “Obamacare” plans – that is insurance plans people buy as individuals on state
    exchanges – are notorious for such high deductibles. Federal regulations allow
    insurers on state exchanges to charge an individual as much as $9,450 out of pocket
    in 2024 – *not including* monthly payments called premiums. That limit is predicted
    to [grow to $14,100 by 2030](https://www.healthsystemtracker.org/brief/aca-maximum-out-of-pocket-limit-is-growing-faster-than-wages/#Maximum%20out-of-pocket%20limits%20for%20HSA-qualified%20health%20plans%20and%20other%20private%20non-grandfathered%20health%20plans,%20actual%20(2014-2023)%20and%20projected%20(2024-2033)).

    point the Kodiak analysis saw in 2018\. George W Bush signed an act in 2003 allowing

    Hospitals view bad debt as bills patients *could* pay but choose not to. But hospitals

    process.

    income data, it often shows the vast majority of patients with past-due debt would
