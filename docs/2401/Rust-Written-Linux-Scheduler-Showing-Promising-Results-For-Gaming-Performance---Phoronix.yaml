- en: A Canonical engineer has been experimenting with implementing a Linux scheduler
    within the Rust programming language. His early results are interesting and hopeful
    around the potential of a Rust-based scheduler that works via sched_ext for implementing
    a scheduler using eBPF that can be loaded during run-time.

    it can even outperform the default Linux scheduler (EEVDF) with certain workloads
    (i.e., gaming)."'
