    and started writing a comment, then realized that this was somehow prompting me
    to write the most succinct summary of my own personal views on politics and economics
    that I have ever managed. So, here goes.

    term “capitalism” is frustratingly both a nexus for useful critque and also reductive
    thought-terminating clichés was to realize that [Animal Crossing: New Horizons](https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/animal-crossing-new-horizons-switch/)
    is closer to my views on political economy than anything Adam Smith or Karl Marx
    ever wrote.'

    in a laboratory environment. It’s fun to gather resources, to improve one’s skills,
    to engage in mutually beneficial exchanges, to collect things, to decorate. It’s
    tremendously motivating. Even merely pretending to do those things can captivate
    huge amounts of our time and attention.

    moral deficiency, but because in a large complex civilization it’s hard to tell
    what needs doing. By the time it’s widely visible to a population-level democratic
    consensus of non-experts that there is an unmet need — for example, trash piling
    up on the street everywhere indicating a need for garbage collection — that doesn’t
    mean “time to pick up some trash”, it means “the sanitation system has collapsed,
    you’re probably going to get cholera”. We need a system that can identify utility
    signals more granularly and quickly, towards the edges of the social graph. To
    allow person A to earn “value credits” of some kind for doing work that others
    find valuable, then trade those in to person B for labor which *they* find valuable,
    even if it is not clearly obvious to anyone else why person A wants that thing.
    Hence: money.'

    towards needs, by aggregating small price signals in a distributed way, via the
    communication technology of “money”. Authoritarian communist states are [famously
    bad at this](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1990/06/inside-the-collapsing-soviet-economy/303870/),
    overproducing “necessary” goods in ways that can hold their own with the [worst
    excesses](https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/07/27/chinese-communist-party-environment-co2/)
    of capitalists, while under-producing “luxury” goods that are politically seen
    as frivolous.

- en: This is the kernel of truth around which the hardcore capitalist bootstrap grindset
    ideologues build their fabulist cinematic universe of cruelty. Markets are motivating,
    they reason, therefore we must worship the market as a god and obey its every
    whim. Markets can optimize some targets, therefore we *must* allow markets to
    optimize *every* target. Markets efficiently allocate resources, and people need
    resources to live, therefore anyone unable to secure resources in a market is
    undeserving of life. Thus we begin at “market economies provide some beneficial
    efficiencies” and after just a bit of hand-waving over some inconvenient details,
    we get to “thus, we must make the poor into a blood-sacrifice to Moloch, otherwise
    nobody will ever work, and we will all die, drowning in our own laziness”. “The
    cruelty is the point” is a convenient phrase, but among those with this worldview,
    the *prosperity* is the point; they just think the cruelty is the only engine
    that can possibly drive it.

    a world *with* the prosperity, but *without* the cruelty. More importantly though,
    by virtue of the fact that people actually play them in large numbers, they *demonstrate*
    that the cruelty is *actually* unnecessary.)

    your real-life house if you don’t give him enough bells when it’s time to make
    rent. In fact, quite the opposite: you have to take time *away* from your real-life
    responsibilities and work, in order to make time for such a game. That is how
    motivating it is to engage with a market system in the abstract, with almost exclusively
    positive reinforcement.'

    basic income, universal health care, free education, free housing — will *not*
    result in a breakdown of our society because “no one wants to work”. People love
    to work.
