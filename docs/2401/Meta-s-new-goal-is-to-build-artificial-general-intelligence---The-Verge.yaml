    AGI. Demis Hassabis, the leader of Google’s AI efforts, [has the same goal](/23778745/demis-hassabis-google-deepmind-ai-alphafold-risks).

    timeline for when AGI will be reached, or even an exact definition for it, he
    wants to build it. At the same time, [he’s shaking things up by moving Meta’s
    AI research group](/e/23807588), FAIR, to the same part of the company as the
    team building generative AI products across Meta’s apps. The goal is for Meta’s
    AI breakthroughs to more directly reach its billions of users.

- en: “We’ve come to this view that, in order to build the products that we want to
    build, we need to build for general intelligence,” Zuckerberg tells me in an exclusive
    interview. “I think that’s important to convey because a lot of the best researchers
    want to work on the more ambitious problems.”

- en: Here, Zuckerberg is saying the quiet part aloud. The battle for AI talent has
    never been more fierce, with every company in the space vying for an extremely
    small pool of researchers and engineers. Those with the needed expertise can command
    eye-popping compensation packages to the tune of over $1 million a year. CEOs
    like Zuckerberg are routinely pulled in to try to win over a key recruit or keep
    a researcher from defecting to a competitor.

    are different dynamics here with multiple companies going for the same profile,
    [and] a lot of VCs and folks throwing money at different projects, making it easy
    for people to start different things externally.”

- en: After talent, the scarcest resource in the AI field is the computing power needed
    to train and run large models. On this topic, Zuckerberg is ready to flex. He
    tells me that, by the end of this year, Meta will own more than 340,000 of Nvidia’s
    H100 GPUs — the industry’s [chip of choice for building generative AI](/2023/8/11/23828874/inside-the-hunt-for-ai-chips-command-line).

    Meta’s H100 shipments for 2023 at 150,000, a number that is tied only with Microsoft’s
    shipments and at least three times larger than everyone else’s. When its Nvidia
    A100s and other AI chips are accounted for, Meta will have a stockpile of almost
    600,000 GPUs by the end of 2024, according to Zuckerberg.'

    about if general intelligence is akin to human level intelligence, or is it like
    human-plus, or is it some far-future super intelligence. But to me, the important
    part is actually the breadth of it, which is that intelligence has all these different
    capabilities where you have to be able to reason and have intuition.”

    moment. “I’m not actually that sure that some specific threshold will feel that

    [the release of Llama 2](/2023/7/21/23803234/the-biggest-ai-release-since-chatgpt),
    its latest large language model, last year. The company didn’t think that the
    ability for it to generate code made sense for how people would use a LLM in Meta’s
    apps. But it’s still an important skill to develop for building smarter AI, so
    Meta built it anyway.
  prefs: []

    lot of people are going to ask coding questions in WhatsApp,” he says. “It turns
    out that coding is actually really important structurally for having the LLMs
    be able to understand the rigor and hierarchical structure of knowledge, and just
    generally have more of an intuitive sense of logic.”

    another focus is on more advanced reasoning and planning abilities.

    recently showed the world.

- en: Zuckerberg wields total power at Meta thanks to his voting control over the
    company’s stock. That puts him in a uniquely powerful position that could be dangerously
    amplified if AGI is ever achieved. His answer is the [playbook that Meta has followed
    so far for Llama](/2023/7/18/23799025/meta-ai-llama-2-open-source-microsoft),
    which can — at least [for most use cases](/2023/10/30/23935587/meta-generative-ai-models-open-source)
    — be considered open source.

- en: “I tend to think that one of the bigger challenges here will be that if you
    build something that’s really valuable, then it ends up getting very concentrated,”
    Zuckerberg says. “Whereas, if you make it more open, then that addresses a large
    class of issues that might come about from unequal access to opportunity and value.
    So that’s a big part of the whole open-source vision.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Without naming names, he contrasts Meta’s approach to that of OpenAI’s, which
    began with the intention of open sourcing its models but has becoming increasingly
    less transparent. “There were all these companies that used to be open, used to
    publish all their work, and used to talk about how they were going to open source
    all their work. I think you see the dynamic of people just realizing, ‘Hey, this
    is going to be a really valuable thing, let’s not share it.’”

    to AI development, Zuckerberg sees a shrewd business play. Meanwhile, the models
    that have been deployed so far have yet to cause catastrophic damage, he argues.

    a lot of cases, the ones calling the most for saying you need to put in place
    all these guardrails on how everyone else builds AI,” he tells me. “I’m sure some
    of them are legitimately concerned about safety, but it’s a hell of a thing how
    much it lines up with the strategy.”

    for AI is [still a concentration of power](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4543807),
    just in a different shape. Meta already has more users than almost any company
    on Earth and a wildly profitable social media business. AI features can arguably
    make his platforms even stickier and more useful. And if Meta can effectively
    standardize the development of AI by releasing its models openly, its influence
    over the ecosystem will only grow.

    early traction](/23922425/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-review), but full-fledged
    AR glasses feel increasingly further out. Apple, meanwhile, has recently validated
    his bet on headsets with the [launch of the Vision Pro](/2024/1/8/24001858/apple-vision-pro-release-date-availability-price),

    Talking to Zuckerberg, it’s clear that, going forward, it’s increasingly going
    to be about humans talking to AIs, too. It’s obvious that he views this future
    as inevitable and exciting, whether the rest of us are ready for it or not.
