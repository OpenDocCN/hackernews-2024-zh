    unanswerable, but it’s also important and vital and guides our actions. I’ve been
    thinking about the purpose of life lately, [for obvious reasons](https://jakeseliger.com/2023/07/22/i-am-dying-of-squamous-cell-carcinoma-and-the-treatments-that-might-save-me-are-just-out-of-reach/)

    life is about other people and our relationships—defined broadly—to them. Okay,
    if that’s the answer then can we be dismissed and go home to watch TV? Probably
    not, because the answer demands more elaboration, though most of us sweep it under

    uncomfortable, since it foregrounds the end, which is, at current technological

    we living up to our potential? Are we achieving our purpose(s)? If the answer
    is “no,” it’s comforting to ask other, less important questions, like who won
    the game last night. We can’t always be asking the big questions. Often, we have

    more unhappiness and isolation as the modern status-quo. Technology also makes
    being alone relatively more fun than it was, say, 30 years ago, which may push
    people towards not cultivating the weak social ties that eventually become close
    friends, lovers, and confidants. Facebook, however, is not going to help you when

    a throwaway line, but I glommed onto it. Schools are a big topic for Brooks, with
    the word “school” appearing in some form 65 times over about 85,000 words,* and
    they’re frequently criticized: “Our schools and other institutions have focused
    more and more on preparing people for their careers, but not on the skills of
    being considerate toward the person next to you.” He also says: “The ability to
    craft an accurate and coherent life story is yet another vital skill we don’t
    teach people in school. But coming up with a personal story is centrally important
    to leading a meaningful life.” It seems like most people are telling themselves
    some kind of story about their life, though it’s frequently more flattering to
    the main character than a third-party author might be. Sometimes, though, it’s
    less flattering: thus the people with inferiority complexes, anxiety, and so forth.
    If you know of a curriculum for crafting accurate and coherent life stories, let
    me know. I suspect that “crafting a life story” is a skill that probably is taught,
    to an extent, though many don’t recognize it. Humanities classes are, or might

    peculiar if I spent 4,000 words arguing that it’s bad to know and see another
    person), but the people who most need to know and see another person are probably
    not reading *How to Know*. Brooks cites a study—[I wonder if it replicates—](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature.2015.18248)examining
    “how accurate people are at perceiving what other people are thinking,” and he
    mentions that some people are reasonably good at this task. But “The problem is
    that people who are terrible at reading others think they are just as good as
    those who are pretty accurate.” It’s the [Dunning-Kruger effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect),
    but for empathy and social skills. Probably there are some people on the margin
    who read it and experience an epiphany, but many, compared to the number who read
    it, need it and will never get it. I know some of those people—too many, maybe.
    Reading *How to Know*, I was tempted to send copies, but then I thought: “This
    isn’t going to work,” and I worried about something else.'

- en: 'Think about other answers to the “What’s the purpose of life?” question. “Science
    and improving the human condition” also seem like solid answers. But I think science,
    technology, and company building are compatible with knowing other people—they’re
    team sports. Hardly anyone does it alone. In pursuing scientific and technical
    questions, we often end up coming to intimately know other people pursuing the
    same questions: so many roads lead back to knowing another person. Doing something
    with someone is often a better way of getting to know them than just talking to
    them. Pick a project, whatever it might be, and do that thing. It can be simple,
    like making dinner. It can be complicated, like launching a startup. Bess and
    I are working together on writing projects, and so we’re coming to know each other
    more, and it’s possible to come to know each other more even after 15 years together.
    We’re still developing, growing, trying new things. Stasis is death. Working on
    a project with someone also means that their feedback holds a mirror up to you,
    so you come to better see and know yourself. When I’m working with Bess, though,
    I most want to come to know her better.'

    What do you do to better know other people?
