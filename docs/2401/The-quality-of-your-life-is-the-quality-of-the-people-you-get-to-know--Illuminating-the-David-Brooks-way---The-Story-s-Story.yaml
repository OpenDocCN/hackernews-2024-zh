    the game last night. We can’t always be asking the big questions. Often, we have

    being alone relatively more fun than it was, say, 30 years ago, which may push
    people towards not cultivating the weak social ties that eventually become close
    friends, lovers, and confidants. Facebook, however, is not going to help you when

- en: 'Brooks’ comment about how we don’t teach social skills in school is a bit of
    a throwaway line, but I glommed onto it. Schools are a big topic for Brooks, with
    the word “school” appearing in some form 65 times over about 85,000 words,* and
    they’re frequently criticized: “Our schools and other institutions have focused
    more and more on preparing people for their careers, but not on the skills of
    being considerate toward the person next to you.” He also says: “The ability to
    craft an accurate and coherent life story is yet another vital skill we don’t
    teach people in school. But coming up with a personal story is centrally important
    to leading a meaningful life.” It seems like most people are telling themselves
    some kind of story about their life, though it’s frequently more flattering to
    the main character than a third-party author might be. Sometimes, though, it’s
    less flattering: thus the people with inferiority complexes, anxiety, and so forth.
    If you know of a curriculum for crafting accurate and coherent life stories, let
    me know. I suspect that “crafting a life story” is a skill that probably is taught,
    to an extent, though many don’t recognize it. Humanities classes are, or might
    have been, the place for this, but reading seems to be in decline relative to

    of shopping; a brand wants you to make the brand part of your identity so that
    you buy more. The same is true of political identities, with “donate” and “vote”
    substituted for “buy.” As with retail identification, most people, myself included,
    lack the wherewithal to fully see what’s happening, or to counteract it if we

    wanted the connection. Attaching yourself to someone who rejects you makes you
