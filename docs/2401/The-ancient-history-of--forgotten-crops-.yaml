    History Consortium** (CHC), dedicated to synthesis research on historical cultivation,
    usage, and geographic and evolutionary trajectories of crop plants, focusing on
    the Middle East and Mediterranean regions of the past 2,000 years.

    multi-regional, multi-period and multi-disciplinary syntheses which address the
    big picture without sacrificing the rigor and nuance that comes with detailed,
    micro-scale research”, says lead author Daniel Fuks.

    questions and knowledge gaps, while also facilitating interdisciplinary collaborations
    in crop history research. Our ‘Orphan crops’ paper is a key initial step at doing
    just that.”

    like-minded research coming out of the [McDonald Institute for Archaeological
    Research](https://www.arch.cam.ac.uk/institutes-and-facilities-overview/mcdonald-institute-archaeological-research),
    the [Department of Archaeology](https://www.arch.cam.ac.uk/) and the University
    of Cambridge more generally. This includes pioneering work by [Emeritus Prof.
    Martin Jones’](https://www.arch.cam.ac.uk/directory/mkj12) team on the domestication
    and dispersal of millets, as well as [*Food Globalisation in Prehistory*](https://www.foglip.mcdonald.cam.ac.uk/index.html).
    It also includes different projects on long-term agricultural change in India
    ([*TwoRains*](https://www.arch.cam.ac.uk/research/projects/recently-completed-projects/tworains)
    and [*Land, Water and Settlement*](https://www.arch.cam.ac.uk/research/projects/archived-projects/land-water-and-settlement)
    projects, headed by [Prof. Cameron Petrie](https://www.arch.cam.ac.uk/directory/cap59),
    and the interdepartmental [TIGR2ESS project](https://www.arch.cam.ac.uk/research/projects/archived-projects/tigr2ess-transforming-indias-green-revolution-research-and)).
    The [Cambridge Global Food Security Initiative](https://www.globalfood.cam.ac.uk/)
    is a multi-departmental research group which promotes interdisciplinary approaches
