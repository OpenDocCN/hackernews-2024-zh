    enough as a pedestrian, but when I’m on my bicycle I often find myself riding
    alongside them, and from that vantage point you catch the ghostly spectacle of
    a steering wheel turning without a hand. Since August, driverless cars have been
    available as taxis hailed through apps but I more often see empty cars than ones
    with backseat passengers. These robots in the shape of cars don’t move like those
    with human drivers. While I waited next to one at a busy intersection, the vehicle
    first halted at the yellow light, then rolled into the intersection, where it
    stopped when the light turned red, confounding the traffic around it.

    training on the city’s streets, first with back-up human drivers, and then without.
    They are here despite opposition from city officials, including the fire chief,
    and San Francisco recently sued the California state bureau that gave companies
    licence to use the streets as their laboratory. Firefighters have reported driverless
    cars attempting to park on firehoses; last June one such car prevented emergency
    vehicles from reaching victims of a shooting; the vehicles are apparently unequipped
    to assess these situations and respond by stopping. Direct communication isn’t

    on foot, on my bike or in a car, I engage in a lot of hand gestures – mostly meaning
    ‘wait!’ or ‘go ahead!’ – when I’m out and about, and look for others’ signals.
    San Francisco Airport has signs telling people to make eye contact before they
    cross the street outside the terminals. There’s no one in a driverless car to
    make eye contact with, to see you wave or hear you shout or signal back. The cars
    do use their turn signals – but they don’t always turn when they signal.

    own them can keep income that would otherwise have gone on drivers’ wages. Automation
    has, of course, been a way to increase owners’ profits since the Luddites protested
    against mechanical looms. Airports have self check-ins; supermarkets have self

    is a good thing. This was the pitch made by many new companies in the 1990s, when
    online shopping and other digital financial transactions first became a big deal.
    The shift has reshaped cityscapes as well as psyches. The American Booksellers
    Association reported that in 2021 alone, ‘the movement of dollars to Amazon and

    than safe: convivial, gregarious. I think of what has come to my city as ‘the
    great withdrawal’. People on the street often seem to have their eyes elsewhere,
    usually on their phones: they might video a crime, but they might also not notice
    it’s happening. Many seem to flinch at direct contact with strangers or pretend
    the apparent intrusion didn’t happen, so I’ve come to avoid the tiny interactions

- en: After a childhood nearby, I moved to San Francisco in 1980 when street life
    and bar life were vibrant, but cafés were rare outside North Beach’s Italian neighbourhood.
    They proliferated in the 1980s and 1990s as places to hang out, maybe read, maybe
    chat to whomever was around or just people-watch. In this millennium, in cafés
    frequented by young white people, every customer seems to be silently staring
    at an Apple product, so that the places look and feel like offices. Even this
    phase may be on the way out. The next phase – of trying to keep customers from
    sticking around – has arrived. A food industry magazine published a story in April
    last year with the headline ‘In 2023, San Francisco Coffee Shops Want You to Get
    the Hell Out. The Vibe Is to Leave. Like Right Now,’ explaining that cafés were
    removing tables and chairs and focusing exclusively on take-away products, in
    part because cafés were being used as free office space. Cultural, social and
    religious institutions have been displaced or run aground, film festivals and
    art centres have left the city, historic businesses, including the oldest Black-owned
    bookstore in the US, have been evicted, all while wealth continues to concentrate

    when the US seized Mexico’s northern half, including California, and renamed the
    port town of Yerba Buena after the Italian saint. It has always been populated
    by dreamers, eccentrics and bohemians as well as opportunists and profiteers;
    until recently there was room for all of them. The Big Four railroad barons were
    Sacramento merchants who made small fortunes equipping goldminers, then relocated
    to San Francisco and made outrageous fortunes building the western half of the
    transcontinental railroad, fleecing the government and monopolising long-distance
    transportation in the west. With this wealth, Leland Stanford founded Stanford
    University in 1885 on the site of his horse ranch 35 miles south of the city,
    and it was from Stanford’s loins that Silicon Valley sprang.

    Japantown to serve the local Japanese American community. Young white people who
    had read or heard about Zen came to be taught by him, and their enthusiasm so
    exceeded that of his original congregation that he set up the San Francisco Zen
    Centre, which has ever since been an incubator for Zen practitioners and priests,
    who’ve founded daughter temples and zendos all over the western world. Zen, like
    the poetry performances in San Francisco’s little co-op galleries and bars, was
    about being present, being together, being in the moment, about learning how,

    by the tech boom, which brought an influx of well-paid workers and a steep rise
    in housing prices over the past three decades, as well as by nationwide economic
    shifts and cuts in social services since the 1980s. Still, a video of an impoverished-looking
    Black guy in a San Francisco drugstore stuffing a trash bag full of goods and
    wheeling it away on his bicycle became an online sensation in 2021\. The closures
    of several downtown chain stores were blamed by their parent corporations on theft,
    but when journalists looked into the stories, they found that in most cases outlets
    were closed because of low revenue and other more mundane problems.

    state far beyond anything previously imagined. At the same time, cryptocurrency
    is being promoted as a means of escaping whatever control nation-states have over
    their residents’ financial transactions, a libertarian privacy currency with almost
    no safeguards. Some have grown rich on it; others have lost their life savings.
    Scams and lawsuits abound.

    the state is dead. Their disappointment and alienation has melded with traditional
    Republican disgust toward liberal cities (and their non-white residents) to paint
    a picture of irredeemable urban squalor. These frightened urbanites are echoing
    the Trumpist drumbeat that cities – particularly in California – are dangerous,
    dark places that must be tamed.

- en: Agroup​ of these disgruntled tycoons has, however, decided to build a new city
    on the north-eastern outskirts of the Bay Area. Flannery Associates – a billionaires’
    consortium whose members include Laurene Powell Jobs (Steve Jobs’s widow), Reid
    Hoffman (co-founder of LinkedIn) and the venture capitalists Marc Andreessen and
    Michael Moritz – quietly bought up 50,000 acres of farmland in Solano County at
    a cost of around $800 million. (By way of comparison, San Francisco covers about
    30,000 acres.) The area’s representative in Congress, John Garamendi, told the
    *Los Angeles Times* that ‘Flannery Associates is using secrecy, bullying and mobster
    tactics to force generational farm families to sell.’ Last August the group revealed
    its hand, sending out a survey announcing its intention to build ‘a new city with
    tens of thousands of new homes, a large solar energy farm, orchards with over
    a million new trees, and over ten thousand acres of new parks and open space’.
    Its website doesn’t give real answers to questions about the environmental impact
    of such a massive development, about the governance of a new city founded and
    (presumably) owned by an elite, about the public services needed for this private
    enterprise. Instead, Flannery Associates has released sedate pastel-toned pictures
    of blank-faced children playing on tree-lined streets of quaint row houses and
    blank-faced adults with brown and black as well as white skin riding bikes and
    sitting in a plaza.

  zh: 一群不满的大亨决定在旧金山湾区的东北郊区建造一个新城市。弗兰纳里联合公司是一个亿万富翁财团，其成员包括劳伦·鲍威尔·乔布斯（史蒂夫·乔布斯的遗孀）、瑞德·霍夫曼（LinkedIn的联合创始人）以及风险投资家马克·安德森和迈克尔·莫里茨等人，他们悄悄地以约8亿美元的成本购买了索拉诺县的5万英亩农田。
    （作为比较，旧金山的面积约为3万英亩。）该地区的国会代表约翰·加拉门迪告诉《洛杉矶时报》：“弗兰纳里联合公司利用保密、恐吓和黑手党战术迫使代代农场家庭出售。”去年八月，该集团揭示了底牌，发送了一份调查问卷，宣布其意图建造“一个新城市，有数万套新住宅，一个大型太阳能农场，种植超过一百万棵新树的果园，以及一万多英亩的新公园和开放空间”。该网站没有就这一大规模开发项目的环境影响、由精英创立和（据推测）拥有的新城市的治理，以及这一私人企业所需的公共服务给出真实答案。相反，弗兰纳里联合公司发布了淡雅的过去式色调图片，显示面无表情的儿童在林荫大道上玩耍，古雅的排屋和面无表情的成年人骑自行车、坐在广场上，他们的肤色有白色、棕色和黑色。

    in July. They will MASSIVELY decrease our home values, the quality of life of

    San Jose and the Black Panthers in Oakland. We were the left edge of America,
