    a red LED light if you’re not seriously old-school and your mouse has a ball,
    this light serves as the illumination for a very simple camera sensor. The mouse
    electronics do their thing by looking for movement in the resulting image, but
    it should be possible to pull out the data and repurpose the sensor as a digital
    camera. [Doctor Volt] has a new video showing just that [with the innards of a
    Logitech peripheral](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAlpt_XYkXI).

    has an SPI interface. The correct register to query the sensor information was
    deduced, and as if my magic, an image appeared. An M12 lens provided focus with
    a handy 3D printed mount, and the board went back into the mouse case as a housing.
    The pictures have something of the Game Boy camera about them, being low-res and
    monochrome, but it’s still a neat hack.

    [You might find it worth finding a gaming mouse though](https://hackaday.com/2022/05/16/gaming-mouse-becomes-digital-camera/),
    for the much higher resolution sensor.
