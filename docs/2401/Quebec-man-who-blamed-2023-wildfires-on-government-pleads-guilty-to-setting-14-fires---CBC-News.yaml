    arson with disregard for human life at the courthouse in Chibougamau, Que.

    by Paré forced the evacuation of around 500 homes in Chapais, Que., a small community
    located around 425 kilometres northwest of Quebec City.

    order due to the raging fires, in particular the fire at Lake Cavan as well as
    the airport fire, two fires that are included in the charges and were cause by
    the accused," Charron said, as she presented an agreed statement of facts.'

    said. Provincial police and first responders "observed that some of the fires
    had no possible natural cause," she said, adding that evidence was found that
    some of the fires had been criminally set.

    area around where a fire had started and was considered a witness. While he denied
    causing the fires, she said Paré "demonstrated a certain interest in fires" during
    the interview, which led police to suspect him.

    posted about Quebec's record-breaking forest fire season. Among those posts, which
    remain on his public Facebook page, were claims the fires had been deliberately
    set by the government to trick people into believing in climate change.
