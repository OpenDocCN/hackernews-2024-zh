- en: Passit was created by [Burke Software and Consulting](http://burkesoftware.com),
    a small team of software developers doing consulting work and supporting open
    source software development. Passit is self-funded from our consulting business
    for now, though we are certainly open to raising additional funds.

    as well if you want! If you’re interested in doing so, visit our [Contributing](/contributing/)
    page for more information.
