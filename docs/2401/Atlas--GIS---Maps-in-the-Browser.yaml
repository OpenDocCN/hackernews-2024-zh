- en: 'Geographic Information Systems (GIS) are powerful tools that allow users to
    visualize, analyze, and interpret data to understand relationships, patterns,
    and trends in relation to locations and geography. At its core, GIS is about mapping
    data: it links locations (where things are) with information (what things are
    like there). Unlike a simple map, however, GIS can show many kinds of data on
    one map.'
