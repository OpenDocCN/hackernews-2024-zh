    language"): Соломон Вениаминович Шерешевский; 1886 – 1 May 1958), also known simply
    as ''Ш'' (''Sh''), ''S.'', or **Luria''s S**, was a Soviet journalist and [mnemonist](/wiki/Mnemonist
    "Mnemonist") active in the 1920s. He was the subject of [Alexander Luria](/wiki/Alexander_Luria
    "Alexander Luria")''s case study *The Mind of a Mnemonist* (1968).'

- en: Shereshevsky participated in many psychological studies, most of them carried
    out by the [neuropsychologist](/wiki/Neuropsychology "Neuropsychology") [Alexander
    Luria](/wiki/Alexander_Luria "Alexander Luria") over a thirty-year time span.
    He met Luria after an anecdotal event in which he was scolded for not taking any
    notes while attending a work meeting in the mid-1920s.^([[1]](#cite_note-1))^([[2]](#cite_note-newyorker-2))
    To the astonishment of everyone there (and to his own astonishment in realizing
    that others could apparently not do so), he could recall the speech word for word.
    Throughout his life, Shereshevsky was tasked with memorizing complex mathematical
    formulas, huge matrices, and even poems in foreign languages that he had never
    spoken before, all of which he would memorize with meticulous accuracy in a matter
    of minutes.^([[3]](#cite_note-Luria-3))

- en: 'On the basis of his studies, Luria diagnosed in Shereshevsky an extremely strong
    version of [synaesthesia](/wiki/Synesthesia "Synesthesia"), fivefold synaesthesia,
    in which the stimulation of one of his senses produced a reaction in every other.
    For example, if Shereshevsky heard a musical tone played he would immediately
    see a colour, touch would trigger a taste sensation, and so on for each of the
    senses.^([[3]](#cite_note-Luria-3)) The images that his synaesthesia produced
    usually aided him in memorizing.^([[3]](#cite_note-Luria-3)) For example, when
    thinking about numbers he reported:'

    3 a gloomy person; 6 a man with a swollen foot; 7 a man with a moustache; 8 a
    very stout woman—a sack within a sack. As for the number 87, what I see is a fat
    woman and a man twirling his moustache.^([[4]](#cite_note-4))

    (or [ideasthesia](/wiki/Ideasthesia "Ideasthesia")) known as [ordinal linguistic
    personification](/wiki/Ordinal_linguistic_personification "Ordinal linguistic
    personification") but is also related to a well-known mnemonic technique called
    the [number shape system](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Number_Shape_System
    "commons:Category:Number Shape System") where the mnemonist creates images that
    physically resemble the digits. Luria did not clearly distinguish between whatever
    natural ability Shereshevsky might have had and mnemonic techniques like the [method
    of loci](/wiki/Method_of_loci "Method of loci") and number shapes that "S" described.

    control over his body's involuntary ([autonomic](/wiki/Autonomic_nervous_system
    "Autonomic nervous system")) functions. From a resting pulse of 70–72, he was
    able to increase it up to 100 by and decrease it to a steady 64–66.^([[5]](#cite_note-5))
    When asked how he could do this, he replied that he would either "see" himself
    running after a train that has just begun to pull out or by "seeing" himself lying
    in bed perfectly still while trying to fall asleep. Shereshevsky was also able
    to simultaneously raise the temperature of his right hand by 2 degrees while lowering
    the temperature of his left hand by 1.5 degrees.^([[6]](#cite_note-6)) Once again,
    he stated that to do this, he simply "saw" a situation in which his right hand
    was touching a hot stove while his left hand was grasping a cube of ice. Shereshevsky
    also claimed to have been able to avoid pain by imagining that someone else was
    experiencing it and watching the other man experience it.^([[7]](#cite_note-7))
    As he described, "It doesn't hurt me, you understand, but 'him.' I just don't
    feel any pain." This, however, was never tested by Luria. Additionally, Shereshevsky
    claimed to be able to cure himself and others of sickness by imagining that the
    problem went away. This was dismissed by Luria as "naive magical thinking."^([[8]](#cite_note-8))

    he "did not, in fact, have perfect recall". Details of Shereshevsky's biography
    are different in his own writing from Luria's account; according to S, they first
    met with Luria on April 13, 1929\. Shereshevsky's father was a bookseller. Shereshevsky
    lived in Moscow with his wife, Aida, and son, in "a damp room in the basement
    of a janitorial outbuilding tucked away in a courtyard". According to Mikhail
    Reynberg, Shereshevsky's nephew, his uncle was pressed to work to the "secret
    police" ([NKVD](/wiki/NKVD "NKVD")) because of his memory, but declined. Reynberg
    recalls that Shereshevsky "could be forgetful", and that he "trained hours a day
    for his evening performances", because he needed "consciously try to commit something
    to memory". Shereshevsky used [method of loci](/wiki/Method_of_loci "Method of
    loci"), imagining [Gorky Street](/wiki/Gorky_Street "Gorky Street") in Moscow
    or "a village street from his childhood" as his memory palaces. He died in 1958
    "from complications related to his alcoholism".^([[2]](#cite_note-newyorker-2))

    He stated that his condition often produced unnecessary and distracting images
    or feelings. He had trouble memorizing information whose intended meaning differed
    from its literal one, as well as [trouble recognizing faces](/wiki/Prosopagnosia
    "Prosopagnosia"), which he saw as "very changeable". He also occasionally had
    problems reading, because the written words evoked distracting sensations.^([[3]](#cite_note-Luria-3))

    her what kind of ice cream she had. 'Fruit ice cream,' she said. But she answered
    in such a tone that a whole pile of coals, of black cinders, came bursting out
    of her mouth, and I couldn't bring myself to buy any ice cream after she had answered
    in that way ...^([[9]](#cite_note-9))

    For example, he believed the word *svinya* ("pig") to sound very fine and elegant,
    which to him, didn't fit the description of a pig, whereas the Yiddish *khazzer*
    ("sow") had a much harsher sound to it that made him think of "a fat greasy belly,
    a rough coat caked with dried mud."^([[10]](#cite_note-10))

- en: His memory was so powerful that he could still recall decades-old events and
    experiences in the smallest details. After he discovered his own abilities, he
    performed as a mnemonist; but this created confusion in his mind. He went as far
    as writing things down on paper and burning it, so that he could see the words
    in cinders, in a desperate attempt to forget them. Some later mnemonists have
    speculated that this could have been a mentalist's technique for writing things
    down to later commit to long-term memory.^([[11]](#cite_note-11)) Reportedly,
    in his late years, he realized that he could forget facts with just a conscious
    desire to remove them from his memory, although Luria did not test this directly.^([[3]](#cite_note-Luria-3))
