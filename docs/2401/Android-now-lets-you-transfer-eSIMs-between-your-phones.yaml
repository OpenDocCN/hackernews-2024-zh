- en: Now that they're seeing widespread adoption, [eSIMs](https://www.androidpolice.com/sim-esim-and-isim/)
    have started to change the way we shop for cell phone coverage. Since they're
    built into your device, they eliminate the need to physically remove your SIM
    card when you want to switch plans. The convenience of using software to download
    and provision SIM plans is undeniable, but there's a catch – transferring plans
    between devices isn't as straightforward as it used to be. To move your plan,
    you often need to go through the whole setup process again, which can range from
    simply using your carrier's app to visiting a store for a QR code scan. While
    eSIMs simplify carrier changes or plan trials, they bring new challenges in device
    transitions.

    its solution](https://www.androidpolice.com/android-partnerships-connected-devices-mwc-barcelona/).
    The company promised to introduce a new [eSIM transfer tool for Android](https://www.androidpolice.com/google-esim-transfer-tool/),
    designed to let users securely and swiftly move their mobile plans to new devices,
    bypassing the need for physical SIMs. Although Google was tight-lipped about the
    specifics and the launch date of this feature, its practical implementation was
    [first noticed](https://www.androidpolice.com/googles-esim-transfer-tool-finally-here-pixel-8/)
    by users setting up their [Pixel 8](https://www.androidpolice.com/google-pixel-8/).
    People were able to transfer their T-Mobile eSIM to their Pixel 8 from their older
    Pixel device, which led some to believe the feature might be limited to Google's
    own devices. However, it turns out that’s not the case.

    one of our readers decided to use Samsung’s SIM transfer tool. To their surprise,
    a pop-up appeared on their nearby LG V60 ThinQ that invited them to transfer their
    SIM to their Galaxy S24 Ultra by scanning a QR code. I was also able to get this
    pop-up to appear on my Pixel 8 Pro, as shown below. It's important to note, though,
    that this feature currently seems to work exclusively with T-Mobile eSIM profiles,
    aligning with Google's earlier mention at MWC 2023 that Deutsche Telekom, T-Mobile's
    parent company, would be one of the first carriers to support this feature.

    tool, originally [added in the One UI 5.1 release](https://www.androidpolice.com/samsung-beat-google-physical-sim-esim-conversions/),
    previously only supported transferring eSIM profiles between Galaxy devices. A
    keen-eyed tipster, [FragmentedChicken](https://www.reddit.com/user/fragmentedchicken)
    on Reddit, noticed a subtle change in the tool's language in the latest One UI
    6.1 update. The tool now indicates compatibility with non-Galaxy devices, hinting
    at a broader usability.

    towards utilizing Google’s eSIM transfer mechanism. When my Galaxy S24 Ultra was
    open on this page, a pop-up provided by the Google Play Services app appeared
    on my nearby Android devices, such as my Pixel 8 Pro. This pop-up is part of the
    EsimTransferHalfSheetActivity that was first spotted by [AssembleDebug](https://twitter.com/AssembleDebug/status/1693469209316188568)
    last August. The rollout of this feature represents a major step forward in eSIM
    support on Android, allowing eSIM transfers between any Android phone, albeit
    subject to carrier support.

    but effectively been launched. The pop-up has been tested and confirmed to appear
    both ways, i.e., when attempting to transfer an eSIM from a Galaxy S24 Ultra back
    to a Pixel 8 Pro. Although carrier support is still limited, this advancement
    still marks a significant milestone in Android's ability to manage eSIMs, providing
    users with enhanced flexibility and convenience in managing their mobile plans
    across different devices.
