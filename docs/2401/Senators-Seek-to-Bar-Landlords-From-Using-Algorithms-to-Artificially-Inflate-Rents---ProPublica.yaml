- en: A group of senators are set to introduce legislation Tuesday that would make
    it illegal for landlords to use algorithms to artificially inflate the price of
    rent or reduce the supply of housing.

- en: The proposed law follows [a ProPublica investigation](https://www.propublica.org/article/yieldstar-rent-increase-realpage-rent)
    that found software sold by Texas-based RealPage was collecting proprietary data
    from landlords and feeding it into an algorithm that recommended what rents they
    should charge. Legal experts said the arrangement could help landlords engage
    in cartel-like behavior if they used it to coordinate pricing.

    ProPublica found that 10 property managers oversaw 70% of all multifamily apartments
    in one neighborhood — and every single one used pricing software sold by RealPage.

    and whiskey in a private club,” said Sen. [Ron Wyden](https://projects.propublica.org/represent/members/W000779-ron-wyden),
    D-Ore., one of the leading sponsors of the new bill. “Although it’s my view that
    these cartels are already violating existing antitrust laws, I want the law to
    be painfully clear that algorithmic price fixing of rents is a crime.”

    and landlords formed a conspiracy “implausible.” In legal filings, they pointed
    to a company FAQ that said the recommendations from the software “may be followed,
    modified, or ignored by an apartment provider.”

    lawsuits against scores of the nation’s biggest landlords alleging violations
    of antitrust law. Congressional lawmakers [called for an investigation by the
    U.S. Department of Justice](https://www.propublica.org/article/yieldstar-rent-increase-realpage-rent-klobuchar),
    which later backed the tenants’ lawsuits. At a Senate hearing in October 2023,

    of Vermont and [Amy Klobuchar](https://projects.propublica.org/represent/members/K000367-amy-klobuchar)
    of Minnesota, would make it illegal for property owners to contract with companies
    that coordinate rent prices and housing supply information. The legislation would
    also bar two or more rental owners from coordinating on such information. Mergers
    between two information-coordinating companies that reduced competition would
    also be banned.

    software,’ but in reality they facilitate collusion by landlords to charge above-market
    rent,” the statement said. “This is exactly how a price-fixing cartel operates,
    but instead of using code names and secret meetings, the price-fixing is offered
    as a service.”

    housing availability and affordability” in which rents have risen by double digits
    since 2020 and homelessness is up, according to the statement. It said the proposed
    law — dubbed the Preventing the Algorithmic Facilitation of Rental Housing Cartels
    Act — would strengthen future legal cases, as well as prevent mergers that could
    push rents higher.

- en: The tenant lawsuits have been consolidated in federal court in Nashville, Tennessee,
    into a case that involves nearly 50 large landlords. RealPage and the other defendants
    have said that the complaint doesn’t show direct evidence of a conspiracy, such
    as “smoking gun” documents or recorded phone calls. “In sum, Plaintiffs have not
    alleged a plausible horizontal price-fixing conspiracy,” their legal filing said.

    said in a statement that if enacted the proposed law would “provide an important
    tool to stop predatory landlords from colluding with one another by using rent-setting
    software and algorithms to further inflate rents.”
