- en: Ned Luke, the actor whose roles include GTA 5's Michael De Santa, has gone off
    on an AI company that released an unlicensed voice chatbot based on the character,
    and succeeded in having the offending bot nuked from the internet ([first spotted
    by PCGamesN](https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/gta-5-michael-actor-attacks-ai-company-for-using-his-voice-in-a-chatbot-of-his-character/)).

    with the text: "Any GTA fans around here? Now take your gaming experience to another
    level. Try having a realistic voice conversation with Michael De Santa, the protagonist
    of GTA 5, right now!"'

    not seem like the type of man to hold back. "This is fucking bullshit WAME," [says
    Luke](https://twitter.com/ned_luke/status/1746559971695763562) (though I am definitely
    hearing all this in Michael's voice). "Absolutely nothing cool about ripping people
    off with some lame computer estimation of my voice. Don’t waste your time on this
    garbage.”

    and tweets promoting it have been deleted. Fellow actors including Roger Clark
    weighed in with sympathy about how much this kind of stuff sucks, and our boy
    wasn''t done by a long shot:'

    all the usual web3 guff about how its technology will "elevate [our] unique identity
    and potential" and "showcase your personal journey", all backed with Blade Runner-esque
    clips of dead-eyed AI bots. Since the pushback over the Michael bot, WAME issued
    a statement expressing "our profound understanding and concern."

    breathtaking, get a load of this: "WAME commits to protecting the rights of voice
    actors and creators while advancing ethical AI practices." Absolutely amazing
    stuff.'

    going on for the rest of all our lives. But in cases like this, I'm inclined to
    side with Luke. Sometimes, you do just hate the companies behind this stuff.
