- en: Ned Luke, the actor whose roles include GTA 5's Michael De Santa, has gone off
    on an AI company that released an unlicensed voice chatbot based on the character,
    and succeeded in having the offending bot nuked from the internet ([first spotted
    by PCGamesN](https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/gta-5-michael-actor-attacks-ai-company-for-using-his-voice-in-a-chatbot-of-his-character/)).

    with the text: "Any GTA fans around here? Now take your gaming experience to another
    level. Try having a realistic voice conversation with Michael De Santa, the protagonist
    of GTA 5, right now!"'

    not seem like the type of man to hold back. "This is fucking bullshit WAME," [says
    Luke](https://twitter.com/ned_luke/status/1746559971695763562) (though I am definitely
    hearing all this in Michael's voice). "Absolutely nothing cool about ripping people
    off with some lame computer estimation of my voice. Don’t waste your time on this
    garbage.”

    weighed in with sympathy about how much this kind of stuff sucks, and our boy

- en: Truly, well said. For its part, [WAME's website](https://www.wame.xyz/) has
    all the usual web3 guff about how its technology will "elevate [our] unique identity
    and potential" and "showcase your personal journey", all backed with Blade Runner-esque
    clips of dead-eyed AI bots. Since the pushback over the Michael bot, WAME issued
    a statement expressing "our profound understanding and concern."

  zh: 确实，说得好。就WAME而言，[WAME的网站](https://www.wame.xyz/)上有关于其技术如何“提升[我们]的独特身份和潜力”以及“展示您个人旅程”的常见网络3废话，所有这些都由Blade
    Runner风格的死板AI机器人片段支持。自从关于迈克尔机器人的抵制以来，WAME发布了一份声明，表达了“我们对此的深刻理解和关注”。

    of AI technology and the ethical and legal realms," says WAME. If you think that''s

  zh: “这一事件突显了人工智能技术的进步与道德和法律领域之间错综复杂的相互作用，”WAME表示。如果你认为这令人叹为观止，那么听听这个：“WAME致力于保护声音演员和创作者的权利，同时推动道德人工智能实践。”绝对令人惊叹。
- en: There are big ethical debates over AI and, sure, they're probably going to be
    going on for the rest of all our lives. But in cases like this, I'm inclined to
    side with Luke. Sometimes, you do just hate the companies behind this stuff.

  zh: 关于人工智能存在着很大的道德争议，当然，它们可能会持续我们所有人的余生。但在这种情况下，我倾向于支持卢克。有时候，你就是讨厌这些背后的公司。
