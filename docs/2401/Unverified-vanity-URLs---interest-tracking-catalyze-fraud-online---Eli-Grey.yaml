- en: Link fraud is increasingly undermining trust in major online platforms, including
    ad-supported websites like Google, Bing, and Twitter.com. These platforms [allow
    advertisers to spoof links](https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/6246601)
    with *unverified* ‘vanity URLs’, laundering trust in their systems, while simultaneously
    deflecting blame onto advertisers when these mechanisms are exploited for fraudulent
    purposes.

    advertising systems that systemically enable link fraud must contend with their

- en: URL spoofing is the act of presenting an internet address that appears to lead
    to one destination but actually leads to another, unexpected, location. URL spoofing
    is commonly referred to as “vanity URLs” by the adtech industry when provided
    as a first-class feature on adtech platforms.

- en: Link fraud is the use of URL spoofing to achieve financial gain or other illicit
    objectives. It is a staple practice in spam emails and scam websites, where links
    may appear legitimate but lead to harmful content.

    ‘abusing’ their unverified vanity URL systems. These companies should not be able
    to get away with creating systems that enable link fraud and then pretend to tie
    their hands behind their back when asked to combat the issue. They have created
    systems for trust-laundered URL spoofing, and then disclaimed ethical or legal
    responsibility for the fundamental technical failures of these systems.

    for unverified URL spoofing to occur. If adtech providers do not perform domain
    ownership verification on vanity URLs, advertisers are technically free to commit
    fraud as they please.

    cookies. Other, more privacy-preserving solutions such as Google’s [Protected
    Audience API](https://developers.google.com/privacy-sandbox/relevance/protected-audience)
    also exist, but these solutions still run unconsensual tracking adtech on user
    hardware. I consider this tracking unconsensual because it is enabled by default
    in Google Chrome and intentionally does not respect browser-level privacy signals,
    even though respect for these signals [will soon be required by law in California](https://cppa.ca.gov/announcements/2023/20231211.html).

    for their advertising use-cases, and these companies are now individually tasked

    agent privacy signals, and user privacy choices across the world. This necessitates
    companies to install consent management solutions on their websites in order to
    use these APIs in a compliant manner. (Full disclosure: I work on a consent management
    SDK for my current employer.)'

    on socioeconomic status. The potential ability to afford a holiday outing or purchase
    a car can be inferred through basic interests. Being able to differentiate on
    interests such as ‘holidays’ and ‘cars’ as compared to ‘fast food’ enables advertisers
    to weaponize link fraud and provide a similar product or service at different
    prices to different socioeconomic groups. Unconsensual tracking of personal interests
    defrauds people of their personal autonomy.

    Sandbox became generally available in Google Chrome back in September 2023](https://privacysandbox.com/news/privacy-sandbox-for-the-web-reaches-general-availability),
    and initially gaslit users by [telling them that Privacy Sandbox “enhanced ad
    privacy”](https://mastodon.social/@wchr/110392171208763650) when it does not,
    in order to mislead users to stay opted-in to the Privacy Sandbox experiments.
    Google misleadingly conflates the removal of third-party cookies with Privacy
    Sandbox to justify these statements. Additionally, opting out of these new adtech
    experiments currently takes many clicks, involving a long and winding trip through
    three separate Privacy Sandbox sub-menus in Google Chrome’s browser settings.

    Interestingly, some of the FBI’s advice for checking ad authenticity is inadequate
    in practice. The FBI suggests “Before clicking on an advertisement, check the
    URL to make sure the site is authentic. A malicious domain name may be similar
    to the intended URL but with typos or a misplaced letter.” — this is useless advice
    in the face of unverified vanity URLs. Instead of asking private citizens to block
    an entire ‘legal’ industry, the FBI should be investigating adtech platforms for
    systemically enabling link fraud.

    to be tracked. One of these is contextual advertising, where an ad network uses
    available context information, such as the category and related topic information
    from the webpage that the ad is being placed on.

    the web to contextual advertising solutions dramatically decreases the ability
    of web sites to fund themselves — for example, 52% less revenue for sites on average,
    and 62% less for news sites, according to one [source](https://services.google.com/fh/files/misc/disabling_third-party_cookies_publisher_revenue.pdf),
    with similar numbers widely replicated by others.”

    Advertisers don’t have an intrinsic right to optimally profit off your device
    hardware, and they should be thankful for whatever profit they do end up getting.
    Contextual advertising is more fair to the web ecosystem as a whole, as it better
    serves to respect user privacy first.
