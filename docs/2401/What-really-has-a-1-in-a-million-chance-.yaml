    to do in class. First I ask students

    conversation, what might they be talking about?*'

    by lightning) and more imaginative suggestions. Then I ask

    chance"?*'

- en: and neither the students nor I can think of anything much more practical than
    [searching in blogs](https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~aldous/Real-World/blogs.html),
    so I show those results. Finally I ask for suggestions for *events that we can
    convince ourselves really do have a 1 in a million chance* (up to a factor of
    2, let's say). Then I go through the students' suggestions; can we quantify the
    chances, and (if so) are they around 1 in a million?

    we guess a President will serve on average about 6 years, then 1 in 6 times 4.0
    million = 24 million babies will someday be President. But it would be wrong to
    point to a particular kindergarten class of 24 kids and assert there''s a 1 in
    a million chance one of them will become President, because of correlation with
    socioeconomic status of the community.'

    in considering risks associated with a particular voluntary activity. Having data
    on the number of deaths is only half the story, because we also need data on how
    many people engage in the activity. And to compare risks of different activities
    we should also consider the time spent on the activity. Consider skiing, for example.
    We want meaningful data in a format like [an average of 0.7 deaths from skiing
    or snowboarding per million visits to official U.S. ski areas](http://www.nsaa.org/media/275270/Fatality_Fact_Sheet_9_1_2016.pdf).

    averages" (or *statistical probabilities*, in an old-fashioned phrase) based on
    past data. The word [micromort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micromort) was coined
    to describe a 1 in a million chance (from population averages) of death from a
    given activity, and that page gives comparisons of different activities. For example

    you don''t seek medical attention you don''t get into official statistics, and
    anyway can you tell the difference between lightning striking the tree you''re

    which vary substantially from year to year but have averaged around 30 in recent
    years. Thus the population average is 1 in 10 million deaths per year, or about
    1 in 150,000 lifetime. But neither figure is at all appropriate for a given individual.
    As I tell students, *your grandmother is too sensible to be outdoors during a
    thunderstorm* and a disproportional number of deaths are [young men](http://www.lightningsafety.noaa.gov/fatalities/fatalities16.shtml).
    Chances for an individual vary hugely with their behavior, and there''s no way
