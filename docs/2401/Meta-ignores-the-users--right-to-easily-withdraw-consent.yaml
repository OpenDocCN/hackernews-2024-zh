    six months since the European Court of Justice (CJEU) [ruled that Meta’s handling
    of user data was illegal](https://noyb.eu/en/cjeu-declares-metafacebooks-gdpr-approach-largely-illegal).
    Yet the social media giant has launched its third attempt to circumvent European
    privacy laws. Instead of asking users for their consent, Meta is now charging
    people for choosing a privacy-friendly setting. As of the beginning of November
    2023, it costs up to €251.88 a year to maintain your fundamental right to data
    protection on Facebook and Instagram. Users who don’t want to pay will have to
    accept being tracked for targeted advertising. *noyb* [has already filed a complaint](https://noyb.eu/en/noyb-files-gdpr-complaint-against-meta-over-pay-or-okay)
    against this approach in November 2023.'

  zh: '**Meta最新试图规避欧盟隐私法的尝试。** 距欧洲法院（CJEU）裁定Meta处理用户数据违法仅过去了六个月。然而，这家社交媒体巨头已经启动了第三次试图规避欧洲隐私法的尝试。Meta现在不再要求用户同意，而是向人们收费以选择隐私友好设置。截至2023年11月初，维护您在Facebook和Instagram上的数据保护基本权利的费用高达251.88欧元/年。不愿支付的用户将不得不接受被跟踪以进行定向广告投放。*noyb*在2023年11月已经对这种做法提出了投诉。'
- en: '**Expensive withdrawal of consent.** But Meta’s seriously flawed approach to
    free consent isn’t the only issue at hand. Once users have consented to being
    tracked, there’s no easy way to withdraw it at a later date. This is illegal.
    Despite Article 7 of the GDPR clearly stating that “it shall be as easy to withdraw
    as to give consent”, the only option to “withdraw” the (one-click) consent, is
    to buy a € 251.88 subscription. In addition, the complainant had to navigate through
    several windows and banners to find the page where he could actually revoke consent.'

  zh: '**昂贵的同意撤销。** 但Meta对自由同意的严重缺陷并非唯一的问题。一旦用户同意被跟踪，就没有简单的方法可以在以后撤销。这是违法的。尽管《GDPR》第7条明确规定“撤回同意应与给予同意一样容易”，但“撤回”（一键式）同意的唯一选择是购买251.88欧元的订阅。此外，投诉人不得不在几个窗口和横幅中导航，才能找到实际撤销同意的页面。'

    consent must be as easy as giving it in the first place. It is painfully obvious
    that paying € 251,88 per year to withdraw consent is not as easy as clicking an
    “Okay” button to accept the tracking.”*'

    monetary costs as an example of a burden that is incompatible with the principle

    data protection authority (DSB) on behalf of one complainant. The authority should
    order Meta to bring its processing operations in compliance with European data
    protection law and to provide users with an easy way to withdraw their consent
    – without having to pay a fee. In addition, *noyb* suggests that the authorities
    should impose a fine to prevent further violations of the GDPR. The case will
    likely be forwarded by the Austrian DSB to the Irish DPC, who is the “lead authority”
    for Meta in the EU.'
