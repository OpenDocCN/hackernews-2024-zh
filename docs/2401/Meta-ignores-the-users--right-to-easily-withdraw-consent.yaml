    six months since the European Court of Justice (CJEU) [ruled that Meta’s handling
    of user data was illegal](https://noyb.eu/en/cjeu-declares-metafacebooks-gdpr-approach-largely-illegal).
    Yet the social media giant has launched its third attempt to circumvent European
    privacy laws. Instead of asking users for their consent, Meta is now charging
    people for choosing a privacy-friendly setting. As of the beginning of November
    2023, it costs up to €251.88 a year to maintain your fundamental right to data
    protection on Facebook and Instagram. Users who don’t want to pay will have to
    accept being tracked for targeted advertising. *noyb* [has already filed a complaint](https://noyb.eu/en/noyb-files-gdpr-complaint-against-meta-over-pay-or-okay)
    against this approach in November 2023.'

- en: '**Expensive withdrawal of consent.** But Meta’s seriously flawed approach to
    free consent isn’t the only issue at hand. Once users have consented to being
    tracked, there’s no easy way to withdraw it at a later date. This is illegal.
    Despite Article 7 of the GDPR clearly stating that “it shall be as easy to withdraw
    as to give consent”, the only option to “withdraw” the (one-click) consent, is
    to buy a € 251.88 subscription. In addition, the complainant had to navigate through
    several windows and banners to find the page where he could actually revoke consent.'

    consent must be as easy as giving it in the first place. It is painfully obvious
    that paying € 251,88 per year to withdraw consent is not as easy as clicking an
    “Okay” button to accept the tracking.”*'

    monetary costs as an example of a burden that is incompatible with the principle
    of Article 7 GDPR in its guidelines, making it clear that Meta is making the withdrawal
    of consent not nearly as easy as to give consent.'

    data protection authority (DSB) on behalf of one complainant. The authority should
    order Meta to bring its processing operations in compliance with European data
    protection law and to provide users with an easy way to withdraw their consent
    – without having to pay a fee. In addition, *noyb* suggests that the authorities
    should impose a fine to prevent further violations of the GDPR. The case will
    likely be forwarded by the Austrian DSB to the Irish DPC, who is the “lead authority”
    for Meta in the EU.'
