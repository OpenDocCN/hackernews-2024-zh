    Valentine's Day 1934. In 1959 he got his bachelor's degree from [ETH Zürich](https://ethz.ch/en.html),
    to which he returned later in life and from which much of his important research
    emerged.

    Unix](https://www.theregister.com/2022/02/09/section_8_unix_user_manual/), or
    BSD as it''s usually known. He stayed in California for the next four years as
    assistant professor of computer science at [Stanford University](https://www.stanford.edu/about/).
    During this time, he worked on his first two programming languages: [Euler](http://pascal.hansotten.com/niklaus-wirth/euler-2/)
    in 1965, and [PL/360](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/321439.321442), published

    the next iteration of the ALGOL programming language, to replace [ALGOL 60](https://www.theregister.com/2020/05/15/algol_60_at_60/).
    Along with [British computer scientist Sir Tony Hoare](https://www.theregister.com/2004/06/14/grand_challenge_compsci/),
    he presented a proposal called [ALGOL-W](http://pascal.hansotten.com/niklaus-wirth/algol-w/).
    However, this was rejected in favour of a more complex proposal from Adriaan van
    Wijngaarden, which became ALGOL-68.

    contributing a strong ["Closing Word"](https://archive.computerhistory.org/resources/text/algol/algol_bulletin/A29/P32.HTM)

    It was, of course, a [big hit](https://www.theregister.com/2020/05/29/happy_50th_pascal/)
    and is still used today. The flipside of this, though, is that the overcomplicated
    ALGOL-68 was a flop: as the *ALGOL-60 Forever* page [puts it](https://www.algol60.org/15algolw.htm):'

- en: It's not much of an exaggeration to say that ALGOL-60 influenced every programming
    language invented afterwards, but its influence ended with the version released
    after Wirth's departure. His own languages were successful, in research and also
    commercially – Delphi is still on sale, and the [Free Pascal project](https://www.freepascal.org/)
    just released Version 3.0 of its cross-platform [Lazarus IDE](https://www.lazarus-ide.org/).
    However, the complexity of ALGOL-68 opened up the opportunities for newer, simpler
    languages such as C, Simula-67, and their offspring C++, and the legions of other
    languages and OSes implemented in them.

    He made a joke which became famous:'

    continued. Similarly, if he had stuck with the well-known Pascal brand, his later
    projects might have replaced it, rather than it surviving alongside its intended
    replacements.

    [PDF], but it was quickly replaced with Modula-2 in 1977\. This added cooperating
    processes called *coroutines* to the language, using his former co-worker C A
    R Hoare's [Communicating Sequential Processes](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/359576.359585)
    model. (These days, these feature in Erlang, Go, and Clojure, and [were lampooned](https://www.theregister.com/2009/12/10/verity_stob/)
    by our own Verity Stob.) In the 1980s and 1990s, Modula-2 was an important language
    across the industry, as we discussed when [GCC 13 gained support for it](https://www.theregister.com/2022/12/16/gcc_13_will_support_modula2/)

    first in 1976-1977 and the second in 1984-1985\. Inspired by what he saw there,
    on his return to Zürich he created the much more ambitious Oberon System. Oberon
    is a programming language, and a tiled-window development environment, and a complete
    operating system implemented in itself. The introduction to the [Oberon manual](http://www.projectoberon.net/wirth/ProjectOberon/PO.System.pdf)
