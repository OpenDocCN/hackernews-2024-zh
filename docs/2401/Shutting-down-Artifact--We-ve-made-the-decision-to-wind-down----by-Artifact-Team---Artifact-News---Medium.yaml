- en: We’ve made the decision to wind down operations of the Artifact app. We launched
    a year ago and since then we’ve been working tirelessly to build a great product.
    We have built something that a core group of users love, but we have concluded
    that the market opportunity isn’t big enough to warrant continued investment in
    this way. It’s easy for startups to ignore this reality, but often making the
    tough call earlier is better for everyone involved. The biggest opportunity cost
    is time working on newer, bigger and better things that have the ability to reach
    many millions of people. I am personally excited to continue building new things,
    though only time will tell what that might be. We live in an exciting time where
    artificial intelligence is changing just about everything we touch, and the opportunities
    for new ideas seem limitless.

    For instance, our app was recently named the everyday essential app of the year
    by the Google Play Store. I’ve gotten the pleasure of working with some of the
    most talented engineers and designers through this venture and they deserve an
    immense amount of respect and credit. While we will go our separate ways, we can
    look back fondly on what we’ve built.

    time to adjust. So, today we’ve decided to slim down the app’s complexity and
    operations by removing the ability to add new comments and posts. This type of
    content requires a fair amount of moderation and oversight and we will not have
    the staff going forward to support these features. Your existing posts, however,
    will remain visible to you on your own profile self-view. In the meantime, Artifact
    will continue to operate the core news reading capability through the end of February.

    an existential moment where many publications are shutting down or struggling,
    local news has all but vanished, and larger publishers have fraught relationships
    with leading technology companies. My hope is that technology can find ways to
    preserve, support and grow these institutions and that these institutions find
    ways of leveraging the scale that things like AI can provide. I am certain there
    are bright minds working on ideas that will continue to surprise and delight us
    in all these areas. We are optimistic about the future and want to thank our community
    for being part of this adventure we call Artifact.
