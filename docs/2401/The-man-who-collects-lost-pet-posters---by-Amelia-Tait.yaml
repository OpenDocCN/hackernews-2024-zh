    lost her three-month-old dog. Pluto was a Whippet – “brown and friendly” – and
    Diana was walking him by Griffith Observatory in LA when he ran away. At home,
    Diana got out some green and red marker pens to make a missing poster; she offered
    a “BIG REWARD” for Pluto’s safe return. She – or someone close to her – drew and
    coloured in the puppy, and as a finishing touch sketched a speech bubble coming
    out of his mouth. “Please. Mercy,” Pluto said.'

    two decades later. I know because of the unusual, surely one-of-a-kind collection
    of Don Bolles, born Jimmy Michael Giorsetti, also known professionally as Kitten
    Sparkles. Don is an LA-based musician who rose to fame as the drummer of the iconic
    70s punk band Germs – he is also possibly the world’s only collector of lost pets.

- en: Well, lost pet posters. In 1978, Don moved from Hollywood Boulevard to a more
    suburban area in West Hollywood and he started noticing the flyers littering the
    lampposts and trees. He was touched by the “folk art” of missing posters – the
    hand-drawn dogs and the poetic pleas meticulously crafted in a time before computers
    and printers were household goods. Although he admits it’s “morally questionable”,
    he began taking the posters, collecting them and storing them in milk crates around
    his home. The oldest posters in his collection were drawn almost half a century
    ago.

    Don’t worry, it’s a perfectly legal liquid – on most of the 35 planets of the
    galactic federation anyway.” For this reason, I can’t tell you the kind of fact
    that I might tell you now – like exactly how many posters Don has in his collection.

    Don says, “It’s like bluegrass music, it’s an American artform.” One of his favourite
    posters features a dog drawn with motion lines around its legs, body, and head.
    The effect is that the pet is shaking – “She’s a small, black, very shy terrier
    mix” writes the owner. “The artwork – no one told these people how to do it,”

    black and white, often fuzzy and unclear, with heads bowed into bowls or turned
    away from the camera. Brandi, who is hard of hearing, seems haunted in her picture,
    her big saucer eyes staring out from the sheet of A4, looking lost long before
    she went missing.

- en: “Some of them you have to read the text to get a feel of the poetry involved,”
    Don goes on. One missing dog poster is written from the perspective of the owner’s
    other dog. “On Feb. 14, I lost my sweetheart,” it begins. Another typewritten
    sheet of A4 begs for witnesses and offers children new bikes if they reveal who
    has stolen a beloved pet. Owners without coloured pencils have written out descriptions
    of their pets’ fur, sometimes making them sound like fantastical creatures. Pam’s
    Yorkshire terrier, for example, has a silver head but golden ears and legs.

    for these people.” He knows that some might find his collection unethical, but
    he notes he only took a poster if there was more than one pinned up in the neighbourhood.
    “Morally and ethically speaking, okay, it’s probably wrong to take these flyers
    from these desperate people with a grieving child,” he says – and yet I can’t
    help but be glad that he did. This is an artform that otherwise would have totally
    been lost.

    not the same.” Don largely stopped collecting lost pet posters after 1985, when
    people started using templates to create them. He believes that the posters in
    his collection, “express an unpretentious humanity generally lacking in the modern

    Cat,” it begins before offering a $250 reward. “He is big,” the flyer continues
    above a drawing of a cat with one pointy ear and one round one. The round ear
    is labelled, “**SPECIAL EAR** RIGHT SIDE.” The cat is described as black and brown
    and was lost in early August, either in 2014 or 1974, it’s hard to tell. I ask
    Don what made this his favourite – what made him want to frame this one out of

    Some of the drawings are fascinating simply because they could never have come
    about any other way. A “5-7lb” pug has been “found”, and his tongue is peeking
    out underneath his squished nose and oddly human eyes. His outline is a thick
    squiggle in an imitation of fur. There’s something alien and frightening about
    him, as though he is an identikit drawing shown on the late-night news.
