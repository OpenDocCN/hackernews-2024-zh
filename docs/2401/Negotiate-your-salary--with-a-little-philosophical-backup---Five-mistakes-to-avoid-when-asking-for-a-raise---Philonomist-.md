**How can you hope to get a pay rise?** From a philosophical standpoint this question leads to another, much harder one: that of the assessment of merit. But since your employer might not appreciate being lectured on the value of labour according to Marx or that of a person according to Kant, you might want to use a little rhetoric in order to convince. But the age-old art of debate mostly teaches us what *not* to say in order to come out of that career meeting with the promise of a raise. 

### **1) Don’t be jealous **

#### with Adam Smith

If you start by mentioning your colleague’s salary increase, you’re off to a bad start. Because you’ll come across as envious. As Adam Smith explains in his *Theory of Moral Sentiments* (1759), “envy is that passion which views with malignant dislike the superiority of those who are really entitled to all the superiority they possess.” Not only will you not get the raise, you might even sound like you can’t be relied on to work on team projects, thus running the risk of being left out. So if you do end up mentioning a colleague during the meeting, be sure not to sound unkind. 

### **2) Don’t threaten **

#### with (and contrary to) Émile Pouget

If, in the course of the conversation, you feel that your employer is a little reluctant, try not to adopt a negative attitude by threatening to go on a “work-to-rule” campaign. This kind of blackmail could suggest you place your individual interests before those of the company – an incorrect stance, economically, which in its extreme form could garner you the reputation of being something of an anarchist. In *Sabotage* (1896), Émile Pouget recommended workers adopt the maxim “bad pay, bad work” and slow down their work rate accordingly. If your employer suspects you might start missing deadlines or deliberately taking time to answer important emails, your future in the company could be in jeopardy. 

> ‘Emotion doesn’t last’

### **3) Don’t seek pity **

#### with Cicero

You might have good reasons to ask for more money. Perhaps you have a relative to look after or medical treatment to cover… But if you try to seek pity, your HR director could reply that you’re not the only person facing difficulties, and perhaps even name a few that are more serious than yours. But even if you manage to “move” them, there remains another major obstacle to this strategy: emotion doesn’t last. Once you’ve left the director’s office, after they told you, “we’ll see what we can do”, there’s a real risk their moment of compassion might evaporate, leaving in its place the feeling of being taken for a ride. In his *De Oratore*, Cicero therefore suggests we paint any misfortunes in just a few words. 

### **4) Don’t brag **

#### with René Descartes

Highlighting one’s merits is an unavoidable stage in the request for a pay raise. But be careful not to go too far by describing yourself as indispensable to the company (even though you might be). That would be confusing pride and vainglory, which Descartes described as “particularly unvirtuous” (*Passions of the Soul*, art.157). Indeed, by overestimating ourselves we risk giving the impression that we might always ask for more in order to feed our ego. It’s better to show humility, whilst keeping in mind that humility too can be unvirtuous, as Descartes explains, in which case it becomes akin to a lack of resolve. To negotiate your salary, it's therefore important not to ask for too much or too little.     

> ‘Don’t forget that HR directors are also psychologists’

### **5) Don’t flatter **

#### with Baltasar Gracián 

There’s still one more tactic that needs to be avoided at all cost: flattering the HR director by relaying all the good everyone thinks of them – telling them how kind they are, how everyone sees them as the pride of the company… In doing so you’ll just come across as hypocritical and devoid of real arguments to justify a raise. In *The Courtiers Manual Oracle: Or, the Art of Prudence* (1647), Spanish Jesuit Baltasar Gracián writes: “Never Exaggerate. It is an important object of attention not to talk in superlatives, so as neither to offend against truth nor to give a mean idea of one's understanding.” (trans. J. Jacobs) Don’t forget that HR directors are also psychologists. To use Gracián’s words, “the true courtesy is performance of duty: the spurious and especially the useless is deceit.” 

So what *should* you say? Simply remind them that your results, availability, and team spirit make you a reliable actor in the success of the company. Emphasise your future commitment more than your past success. In short, show them that by increasing your salary, they’re investing in a long-term project.
