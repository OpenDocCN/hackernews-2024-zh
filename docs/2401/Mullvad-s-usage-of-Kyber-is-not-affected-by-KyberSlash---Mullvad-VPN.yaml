- en: Vulnerabilities in some implementations of Kyber, the quantum-resistant key
    encapsulation mechanism, were [recently disclosed](https://groups.google.com/a/list.nist.gov/g/pqc-forum/c/ldX0ThYJuBo/m/uIOqRF5BAwAJ).
    Mullvad’s quantum-resistant tunnels are not affected by this vulnerability, nor
    any vulnerability of the same kind.

- en: The two timing-based attacks named KyberSlash1 and KyberSlash2 builds on the
    fact that some implementations of Kyber were not performing critical operations
    in constant time. If a service allows an attacker to request many such operations
    towards the same key pair, the attacker can then measure timing differences and
    slowly compute the secret key.

- en: This type of timing-based vulnerabilities are fairly common in cryptography.
    And that is why Mullvad’s quantum-resistant tunnel protocol is designed in such
    a way that this entire class of vulnerabilities are not exploitable.

- en: The Mullvad app computes a completely new key pair for each quantum-resistant
    tunnel connection. No secret key material is ever reused between two tunnels or
    two different users. Therefore each secret key is only used for a single encapsulation
    operation, so the scenario where timing differences can be measured does not exist.
    As a result, it does not matter if the Kyber implementations used by the Mullvad
    app and servers are vulnerable to KyberSlash1 and KyberSlash2 or not, the scenario
    in which it can be exploited does not exist.

- en: The key pairs for quantum-resistant shared secret exchange are generated on
    the *clients* in Mullvad’s setup, and only the WireGuard server to which the client
    is establishing a connection can send a ciphertext to it. So no endpoint where
    a key encapsulation operation can be requested is ever exposed publicly or where
    a potential attacker could reach it. It all happens inside the encrypted WireGuard
    tunnel between the client and the WireGuard server.

- en: As an extra layer of security, our quantum-resistant tunnels do not rely on
    only Kyber. We use two quantum-secure key encapsulation mechanisms (Kyber and
    Classic McEliece) and mix the secrets from both. This means that both algorithms
    must have *exploitable* vulnerabilities before the security of the VPN tunnel
    can become affected.
