## **How are they different?**

In simplest terms, Moonwalkers X are lighter, quicker, and smarter than the original Moonwalkers. By moving to 6 wheels instead of 10 and adopting the magnesium alloy based drivetrain, Moonwalkers X are nearly 1 lb. lighter per shoe.

Additionally, ShiftOS 2.0 incorporates a complete overhaul of the AI control system, further boostingsafety and agilitywhen maneuvering, especially in close quarters.

Plus, the new modular design of Moonwalkers X bodywork means ease of service and customization.
