- en: It’s a big year for the oozing creep of corporate paternalism and ad-tracking
    technology online. Google and its subsidiary companies have tightened their grips
    on the throat of internet innovation, all while employing the now familiar tactic
    of marketing these things as beneficial for users. Here we’ll review the most
    significant changes this year, all emphasizing the point that browser privacy
    tools (like [Privacy Badger](https://privacybadger.org/)) are more important than
    ever.

    the official death date for Manifest V2, hastening the reign of its janky successor,
    Manifest V3\. [We''ve been complaining](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/12/chrome-users-beware-manifest-v3-deceitful-and-threatening)
    [about this since the start](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/12/googles-manifest-v3-still-hurts-privacy-security-innovation),
    but here''s the gist: the finer details of MV3 have gotten somewhat better over
    time (namely that it won''t completely break all privacy extensions). However,
    what security benefits it has are bought by limiting *what all extensions can
    do.* Chrome could invest in a more robust extension review process. Doing so would
    protect both innovation and security, but it’s clear that the true intention of
    this change is somewhere else. Put bluntly: Chrome, a browser built by an advertising
    company, has positioned itself as the gatekeeper for in-browser privacy tools,
    the sole arbiter of how they should be designed. Considering that Google’s trackers
    are [present on at least 85% of the top 50,000 websites](https://spreadprivacy.com/duckduckgo-tracker-radar/),
    contributing to an overall profit of approximately [225 billion dollars in 2022](https://www.statista.com/statistics/266249/advertising-revenue-of-google/),
    this is an unsurprising, yet still disappointing, decision.'

    allegedly protect Safari users from malicious extensions. While it’s important
    to protect users from said malicious extensions, it’s equally important to honor
    their privacy.

- en: This year also saw the rollout of Google's planned ["Privacy Sandbox" project](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2023/09/how-turn-googles-privacy-sandbox-ad-tracking-and-why-you-should),
    which also uses a lot of mealy-mouthed marketing to justify its questionable characteristics.
    While it will finally get rid of third-party cookies, an honestly good move, it
    is replacing that form of tracking with another called the "Topics API." At best,
    this reduces the number of parties that are able to track a user through the Chrome
    browser (though we aren’t the only [privacy experts](https://github.com/WebKit/standards-positions/issues/111#issuecomment-1359609317)
    [casting doubt](https://github.com/mozilla/standards-positions/issues/622#issuecomment-1372979100)
    toward its so-called benefits). But it limits tracking so it's only done by a
    single powerful party, Chrome itself, who then gets to dole out its learnings
    to advertisers that are willing to pay. This is just another step in transforming
    the browser from a user agent to an advertising agent.

    from Youtube when trying to watch a video. The blocking message gave users a countdown
    until they would no longer be able to use the site unless they disabled their
    ad-blockers. Privacy and security benefits be damned. YouTube, a Google owned
    company which saw its own all-time high in third quarter advertising revenue (a
    meager [8 billion dollars](https://www.statista.com/statistics/289657/youtube-global-quarterly-advertising-revenues/)),
    has no equivocal announcement laden with deceptive language for this one. If you’re
    on Chrome or a Chromium-based browser, expect YouTube to be broken unless you
    turn off your ad-blocker.

    In reality, one is deeply imbricated with the other. All this bad decision-making
    drives home how important privacy tools are. Privacy Badger is one of many. It’s
    not just that Privacy Badger is built to protect the disempowered users, that
    it's a plug-n-play tool working quietly (but ferociously) behind the scenes to
    halt the tracking industry, but that it exists in an ecosystem of other like minded
    privacy projects that complement each other. Where one tool might miss, another
    hones in.

    stops abusing our desires to not be snooped on, privacy tools must be empowered
    to make up for these harms. Users deserve the right to choose what privacy means
    to them, not have that decision made by an advertising company like Google.
