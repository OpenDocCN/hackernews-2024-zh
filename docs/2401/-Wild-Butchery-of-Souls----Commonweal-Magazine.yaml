    stood at 328 officers and 5321 / other ranks”), which steadily decline throughout
    the book. There’s the occasional casualty, such as “App. C.H. ‘B’ boy / killed
    accidentally by grenade,” or a disciplinary case: “And the / curtains of MIDIAN
    did tremble when he woke and / murmured a memorial for Pte. A. Denny who at that
    / time was shot by a firing squad.” Instead of sensually imagined poetic detail,
    we get the administrative data of a life snuffed out, and watch it echo in the
    life of a child decades later. Hutchinson’s deliberately impersonal style forces
    the reader to feel the paucity of the evidence. We thrill at the occasional archivist’s
    find and wonder what lies behind it, what the data of troop moments and casualties
    conceal. Restraint is the operative mode here, though occasionally a phrase will
    startle. “Wild butchery of souls blossomed in the desert,” begins one section,
    but what follows is not an image of combat but Godspeed shaking a jam jar full
    of fireflies, and a report of the now severely diminished numbers of troops. In
    an earlier section we get an incantatory list of the types of mud the men shoveled
    to build trenches: “Frostbitten mud. Shellshock mud. Dungheap mud. Imperial mud.
    / Venereal mud. Malaria mud. Hun bait mud. Mating mud.” This goes on for fourteen
    lines, the list ranging beyond the conventional tropes of the First World War
    to evoke what Jones referred to as the “mythus and deposits,” the poet’s cultural
    context, before ending with the line, “They resurrected new counterkingdoms, /
    by the arbitrament of sword mud.”'

    a history whose relics are so few? In “Air,” Derek Walcott says of the Caribbean
    that “there is too much nothing here” because the “jaws of the rain forest…never
    rest, / grinding their disavowal of human pain.” The same is true of the jaws
    of empire when it comes to subject peoples: the main document Hutchinson had to
    work from was the journal of a white soldier, offering him nothing from the inside.'

    (close enough to Hutchinson’s) with the past, as in a mention of shoveling trenches
    intercut with Godspeed observing his bereft aunt, whose lover, a cruise ship waiter,
    is lost to the sea. This is followed by a line with doubled meanings: “God was
    a wicked God to cripple so much / beauty.” In another passage, troop movements
    to Baghdad and Amman precede a paragraph about a flood of butterflies, alive on
    the lilies but dead or slowly dying on the road, crushed time and again by passing
    cars. Godspeed responds to this sight of beauty and horror by ordering “a hurricane
    to wipe the roads clean,” and the men cross a blazing hot country without cover
    to “TAHPANHES where weeping was ceaseless.” What is odd, as we move through these
    scenes, is that the richly described present often seems more insubstantial than
    the scraps we’re given of the past, and we begin reading sections like those on
    the butterflies as imagistic links to the history we cannot see. In Hutchinson,
    the “now” is a palimpsest through which the obscured past unexpectedly appears,
    and so the careful attention to the present reveals what Anthony Domestico calls
    a “layered plentitude.”'

    of their individual characters and traits, but rather the way in which their wounds,
    lives, and deaths persist, invisibly shaping not simply the modern Godspeed but
    the very landscape, as dark matter shapes gravitational effects. “THEY WERE BORN
    AND THEIR BLOOD STILL / ECHO,” he tells us in the final dedication, and it is
    Hutchinson’s caution and the respect with which he approaches his subject—never
    cheating, never pretending to know more than he does, while nonetheless never
    able to believe his subjects truly disappeared into oblivion—that allows us to
    feel viscerally that strange entwining of the forgotten dead and the present.
