- en: The Hungarian composer György Ligeti called the relationship between New Music,
    Westdeutscher Rundfunk and the city of Cologne a "triumvirate". It was an inseparable
    connection that made WDR a pioneer in the development and promotion of an entirely
    new musical production process. For months, composers were able to experiment
    here for the creation of never-before-heard sound constructions, to fiddle with
    tape snippets and noise generators, to play with ring modulators and octave filters.

    role model, the mother of all studios, and the first place in the world to work
    entirely in the field of electronic synthesis, i.e. without any instruments or

    electronic music. What Wimbledon is for tennis players and Wembley Stadium for
    footballers, the WDR Studio was for the new composers of that time. Receiving
    an invitation there felt like being knighted. If you were allowed to experiment
    there, you had made it. And it was with correspondingly immense respect and awe
    that most sound artists approached the place.

    might have happened at other studios, because he wanted to live up to the tradition."

    idea of trying out and developing new instruments and coming up with new technical
    and musical ideas. One example of this was the Radio Research Institute that was
    set up by the Prussian Ministry of Culture in Berlin in May 1928 and abolished
    by the Nazis in 1935\. The Research Institute was seen as a laboratory for new
    sounds, but also carried out research into the sound film technology that was
    becoming popular in 1929 and into early ways of storing music on discs. Among
    the pioneers of electric music who came and went at the Berlin Research Institute
    were Oskar Sala, Friedrich Trautwein, and Paul Hindemith.

    the few bars that you have just heard are simply setting the tone for our evening
    program." That first broadcast was about the 12-tone theory in Thomas Mann''s
    Doctor Faustus novels: explained on the piano. It was an indication that not everything
    that came out of the Studio for Electronic Music was simple fare and was not intended
    to be.'

    he also lectured on the Darmstadt Summer Course for New Music. As a professor
    at the University of Music, he was also in charge of the Studio for Electronic
    Music there, from 1965 to 1971\. He worked with Hans-Ulrich Humpert, his successor
    at the Electronic Studio at the University of Music, on a lexicon of electronic
    music. Shortly before the manuscript was finished, on December 15th, 1972, Eimert
    died in Düsseldorf.

    developments in electronic music to produce their works.
