    a long decline because they couldn’t master making a profit from publishing on
    the internet. That’s why Google, which was able to transform our content into
    profits via advertising, made billions and billions while news publications continue
    to circle the drain.

    And if Microsoft and OpenAI don’t make quite as many billions as they’d hoped
    for, I won’t cry for them.

    future looks like. Cory Doctorow, blogger and science fiction writer, coined the
    pungent word, “Enshittification” for it. By this, he means the fall off in the
    quality of online sites and information.
