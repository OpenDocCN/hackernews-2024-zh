    Iraqi forces placed Russian-made GPS jammers near strategically important assets

    either to protect high-ranking officials or to assist in the air defense of military

  zh: Munro 的团队通过一个名为电子飞行包的应用成功地入侵了飞机，飞行员使用该应用从移动设备与飞机航空电子设备进行交互。例如，这些应用用于计算飞机的起飞速度和滚动距离。Munro
    表示：“通过我们发现的漏洞，我们实际上可以使计算器输出错误的信息。”“这可能导致飞机坠毁。” 2003年，在新加坡航空公司的一架747飞机中误输入了一个不正确的数字，导致飞机滑出跑道。
- en: Another system Munro says could easily be compromised is ACARS, which provides
    text messaging between pilots and their airlines, including updated flight clearances.
    “Dispatchers will often send a new flight plan to an airplane over ACARS when
    they’re in the air. And the pilots will click a button on the instrument panel
    to accept,” Munro says. “There have been a few cases when planes have accidentally
    been sent the wrong information and they only realized it when they flew west
    instead of east. If the error was small enough that you didn’t notice, you could
    get yourself in real trouble.”

  zh: Munro 表示，另一个容易受到威胁的系统是 ACARS，它提供了飞行员与航空公司之间的文本消息，包括更新的飞行清关信息。“调度员通常会在飞机在空中时通过
    ACARS 发送新的飞行计划。飞行员会在仪表板上点击一个按钮来接受，”Munro 说。“有几次飞机意外收到了错误的信息，他们只有在向西飞行时才意识到这一点。如果错误足够小，你没有注意到，那你可能会陷入真正的麻烦。”
- en: Because there are so many aviation regulatory agencies and so many aircraft
    operators, shoring up the cybersecurity of the entire system will be a tall order,
    even if there were a sense of urgency about the issue, which so far there isn’t.
    “The FAA has known about the spoofing threat for over 20 years,” says Humphreys.
    “Nothing it has done in that time has really addressed the problem. I think it’s
    disgraceful.”

  zh: 由于航空监管机构众多，航空公司也众多，加强整个系统的网络安全将是一项艰巨的任务，即使有关于这个问题的紧迫感，到目前为止还没有。 "FAA 已经知道关于欺骗威胁已经有
    20 多年了，" Humphreys 说。 "在这段时间里，它所做的一切都没有真正解决问题。我认为这是可耻的。"

    the authorities will do to prevent future security exploits but what they should
    do right now.

  zh: 对于向 OpsGroup 寻求指导的 Zee 和飞行员们来说，问题不在于当局将采取什么行动来防止未来的安全漏洞，而在于他们现在应该做什么。
- en: “Pilots have been getting very, very little guidance on what to do from manufacturers
    of avionics equipment in the past couple of months,” Zee says. “My guess would
    be that they realize the enormity of the problem and they’re not really keen to
    kind of go, ‘Yeah, it’s a problem. We should have designed it differently. We
    didn’t. And now we’ve got to figure out what to do.’”

  zh: '"飞行员们在过去几个月里几乎没有从航空设备制造商那里得到什么指导，" Zee 说。 "我猜他们意识到了问题的严重性，他们不太愿意去 ''是的，这是一个问题。我们本应该设计得不同。我们没有。现在我们必须弄清楚该怎么做。''"'
