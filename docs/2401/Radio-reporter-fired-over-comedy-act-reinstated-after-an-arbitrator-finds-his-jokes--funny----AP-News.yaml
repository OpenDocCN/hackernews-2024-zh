    NPR station, after an arbitrator determined that, while the bits posted to social
    media could be interpreted as “inflammatory,” the organization “rushed to judgment”
    in its decision to terminate him.

    them,” he said. “So it was a lot of abuse from a lot of people who have never
    met me, who’ve never seen my stand-up just saw what WHYY said about me, which
    is not great.”

    health and science program, since 2018 when he was terminated a year ago after
    executives found his social media account — under Jad S. or @jadslay — that posted
    clips of his standup comedy.

- en: Officials at WHYY argued that his standup comedy violated the company’s code
    of conduct, social media guidelines and values of social responsibility, finding
    his routine to be “inflammatory.” They submitted nine videos from social media
    as their evidence. They argued the clips were “‘egregious’ in content, and had
    ‘sexual connotations, racial connotations, and misogynistic information,’ ” according
    to the arbitration documents.

    2013 after serving in the U.S. Marine Corps, argued in arbitration his stand-up
    routines stem from his experiences as an Arab American raised in a Muslim family,
    and his time in military service and reporting in the Middle East.

    could be seen as inflammatory — “the very low standard in the Collective Bargaining
    Agreement that I am required to apply,” he wrote — he also found them to be sometimes

    also asked to delete any “offensive post-discharge” posts where he disparaged
    the company for his firing. (Coburn found that, “under the circumstances, such
    ‘foolishness’ does not disqualify him from reinstatement.”)

    sclerosis, a chronic illness that affects the central nervous system. One of his
    biggest fears, he said, was losing fine motor function and, with it, his ability
    to play the guitar and piano. But stand-up was a safe spot: There’s a stool if
    he needs to sit down, a mic stand if he can’t hold the microphone.'
