    demo of such a system](/2023/5/28/23740908/nvidia-ace-demo-voice-ai-npc-game-characters)
    — but this January, I got to try a fully interactive version for myself at CES
    2024\. I walked away convinced we’ll inevitably see something like this in future
    games.

    They didn’t feel like real people — we’ve got a ways to go before voices, facial
    expressions, and body language catch up to what’s expected of a real-life interaction.
    There was sometimes a little robotic stutter and often a short delay before each
    NPC delivered their lines. Occasionally, they misinterpreted me.'

    Saddling up to the bar of a cyberpunk ramen shop to ask real questions with my
    real voice — it exceeds what I expect from the average denizen in *The* *Elder
    Scrolls* or *Assassin’s Creed.*

    ramen shop, and Nova, a digital NPC who seems to be a friend. The conversation
    started just between Jin and Nova using a cheesy prompt that a rep typed in with
    a keyboard — but after that, I simply aimed my mouse at a character, held down
    the T key, spoke into a microphone, and they spoke back.

    Verge* is awesome, especially when they dive into the latest cybernetic tech and
    not just the usual corporate news. It’s like peeling back the layers on the city
    itself.'

    lines from good characters in my favorite games. You can also see how they only
    spoke in short bursts and how they sometimes lost the thread. But maybe it could
    be used to populate a whole world with lesser characters or combined with good,
    canonical dialogue written by a real human being, where generative AI just helps
    it go further.

    “Knowledge Bank” filled with text documents they can refer to, sliders for “Personality”
    traits like extroversion, openness, and sensitivity, their own “State of Mind,”
    some “Guardrails” to hopefully prevent them from [doing wacky AI things](/2023/2/16/23602965/microsoft-bing-ai-sydney-fury-furry-venom)
    (and filters for blocked words), and a memory bank as well. Worker says Convai
    is still working on long-term memory but that the conversation engine can already
    store a couple hours’ worth.

    of a button to modify Jin and Nova’s memory with an additional text file, and
    suddenly, they were able to tell me about [Nvidia’s new graphics cards](/24039832/nvidia-rtx-4070-super-review-gpu-graphics-card-benchmark-test).
    Another button press, and these characters could speak in a new language.

- en: Since I didn’t actually interact with the imaginary world that Jin and Nova
    theoretically live in, I can’t fully tell what they’re capable of. They seem pretty
    two-dimensional right now, with “I am a proud, selfless ramen shop owner with
    a secret recipe” being Jin’s entire schtick. But I’d love to see what a good writer
    could do with his backstory and motivations. I can now absolutely imagine games
    where NPCs remember what they’ve seen and react to the game’s script as it unfolds.
    The right bits could enter their memory bank at the right time, get filtered through
    their personality and desires, and make a game more immersive and interactive
    as a result.
