    programs in order to boost the nation's military edge in space.

- en: As the world's superpowers continue to invest in the [militarization of space](https://www.space.com/space-force-space-flag-simulated-orbit-combat),
    some leaders at the Pentagon believe it's time to declassify some of the secretive
    space programs in the United States' portfolio. To that end, U.S. Deputy Secretary
    of Defense Kathleen Hicks recently approved a new policy that will reduce the
    classification level of some highly secret space programs and technologies.

- en: The policies that have prohibited sharing this information are outdated and
    are holding back the U.S. when it comes to [superiority in space](https://www.space.com/darpa-space-weapons-superiority-technologies),
    according to DoD Assistant Secretary for Space Policy John Plumb. "What the classification
    memo does, generally, is it overwrites — it really completely rewrites — a legacy
    document that had its roots 20 years ago, and it's just no longer applicable to
    the current environment that involves national security space," Plumb said last
    week, [according to Breaking Defense](https://breakingdefense.com/2024/01/dod-completely-rewrites-classification-policy-for-secret-space-programs/).

- en: The policy does not mean that these programs and technologies will now be fully
    unclassified and revealed to the public; instead, it will lower their classification
    levels in order to share some technologies and programs with private industry
    and international allies to help the U.S. build an "asymmetric advantage and force
    multiplier that neither China nor Russia could ever hope to match," Plumb said
    in a DoD [statement](https://www.defense.gov/News/News-Stories/Article/Article/3649094/space-policy-official-details-approach-to-maintaining-us-edge/).

    own classification levels, rather than spread a blanket DoD policy over all military
    space programs and technologies.

- en: One of the key issues driving this policy change is the use of what are known
    as Special Access Programs (SAPs), security protocols that severely restrict the
    sharing of highly sensitive and classified information. Some of these SAPs are
    acknowledged, meaning their existence is known to the public but their details
    haven't been revealed. Others, however, are unacknowledged, meaning their mere
    existence is even a secret.

    most valuable space programs, giving the U.S. military an edge in what the Department
    of Defense [now considers the "most essential domain"](https://www.space.com/space-command-conflict-in-space-deterrence-kathleen-hicks)
    in terms of national security.

    brings massive value to the warfighter, massive value to the department, and frankly,
    my hope is over time [it] will also allow us to share more information with allies
    and partners that they might not currently be able to share," Plumb said.'

    policy [for years](https://transforming-classification.blogs.archives.gov/2021/03/08/space-operations-chief-decries-over-classification-and-its-effect-on-operations/),
    arguing that excessive classification has prevented advanced military capabilities
    from deterring attacks from adversaries, which is one of the main reasons they
    were created to begin with.
