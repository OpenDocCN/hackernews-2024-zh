    was exploring the world of alternative building materials.

- en: This is something I first got interested in while working on a different (currently
    unpublished) story last year. It turns out that a lot of work is being done on
    alternatives to bricks and concrete. There are a bunch of reasons for this, including
    the fact that concrete is incredibly carbon intensive to produce. But ultimately,
    it feels like the main motivation is that they’re just kind of cool.

    There are reinforcement bars made from hemp. There are people returning to the
    10,000-year-old material called cob. And yes, for real, there are experiments
    in growing buildings out of fungus. Combining that with spider silk was my own
    idea, as far as I know—perhaps some cunning engineer beat me to it, and I just
    haven’t read their work yet.

- en: Lots of these experiments will go nowhere. The materials won’t be strong enough,
    durable enough, or sustainable enough for widespread use. Some perfectly good
    ones might be abandoned for perfectly bad business reasons. But they don’t all
    need to succeed for the experiments to be worthwhile. If just a few prove productive,
    then they could help us to build in newer, better, more interesting and varied
    ways.

- en: The important thing, for scifi writers as much as for architects and builders,
    is to get out of familiar patterns of thinking, to look at alternatives. Why should
    every future city be a place of concrete, glass, and steel? Why couldn’t it be
    grown from sunflowers, woven by insects, raised from lava flows? Perhaps it could
    be built considering the complete life cycles of buildings, assuming that the
    building will one day replaced, and planning for what will happen to its parts.
    Maybe a single city could use hundreds of different approaches, as varied as the
    people living in it.

    from your core idea. But if you’re looking for something different to build your
    story out of, then maybe look into alternative homes and the materials they’re
    made from. At the very least, you’ll be entertained.
