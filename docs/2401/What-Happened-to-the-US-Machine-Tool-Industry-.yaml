- en: The first was the development of numerical control. Prior to the 1950s, there
    were generally two ways that a machine tool could be controlled. A skilled machinist
    could manually move the tool and/or the part to be machined to cut it into the
    proper shape, drill the proper holes, and so on. Alternately, a machine tool could
    be mechanically automated. Ford, in pursuit of ever-greater efficiencies on the
    Model T assembly line, built and acquired dozens of different automated and semi-automated
    machine tools for tasks such as making screws, boring piston heads, and drilling
    engine blocks.

  zh: 第一个是数控技术的发展。在1950年代之前，通常有两种方法可以控制机床。一种是熟练的机械师可以手动移动工具和/或待加工的零件，将其切割成合适的形状，钻孔等。另一种是机床可以机械自动化。为了在
    T 型车装配线上追求更高效率，福特公司建造并收购了数十种不同的自动化和半自动化机床，用于制造螺丝、钻孔活塞头和钻孔发动机缸体等任务。
- en: This sort of automatic machinery had been around since the 19th century, but
    it was somewhat fixed in the tasks it could perform. The machines couldn’t easily
    be changed to produce something else without substantially rebuilding the machine
    (these sorts of difficulties are why Ford had to shut the Rouge factory down for
    6 months to retool when changing from the Model T to the Model A, and why auto
    producers were so interested in robotic welding).

    T 型车改为 A 型车时不得不关闭 Rouge 工厂六个月，以及为什么汽车生产商对机器焊接如此感兴趣的原因）。
- en: This changed with the development of numerical control, or NC. With NC, the
    movements of a machine could be encoded on a paper tape or a punched card. Changing

- en: 'Numerical control was first developed by MIT’s Servomechanism Lab in conjunction
    with the Air Force in the 1950s. Early on, the technology had little commercial
    appeal: it was expensive, complex, unreliable, and designed to solve specific
    complex fabrication problems in aerospace manufacturing, rather than the simpler
    machining needs that made up the bulk of machine tool demand. NC technology is
    sometimes described as “developed from the roof instead of from the foundation”.
    But that started to change by the early 1960s: machine tool manufacturers began
    to produce more reliable machines designed for broader commercial appeal (though
    the technology remained very expensive). In 1958, Kearney and Trecker introduced
    its [Milwaukee-matic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3YrbEGWE04&t=211s), the
    first of what became an entirely new category of machine tool, the machining center.
    A machining center contained a tool-changer with dozens of different specialized
    cutting tools, and could be programmed via numerical control to perform a series
    of machining operations, automatically changing to different cutting tools as
    required. This greatly increased efficiency: a typical machine tool was only operational
    25-30% of the time, with much of the rest of the time spent setting up the machine
    and prepping the part to be worked. But Kearney and Trecker boasted that the Milwaukee-matics
    were operational more than 75% of the time. And because of its ability to flexibly
    mount different cutting tools quickly and automatically, a machining center could
    perform tasks which previously required many different machines.'

- en: With NC, US machine tool makers had primarily focused on the high end of the
    market, using advances in computers and other technology to create increasingly
    precise machines capable of tracing complex paths, and tailoring the machines
    to the needs of individual customers (as was common in the US machine tool industry).
    This focus was in part due to the guiding hand of the air force and the aerospace
    industry, which demanded these types of machines for production of advanced parts.
    Japanese builders, on the other hand, developed simpler, cheaper NC machines based
    on standardized designs, aimed at the large, untapped lower end of the market
    that previously couldn’t justify the cost of an expensive NC machine. And a focus
    on simpler, standardized designs, along with the traditional Japanese focus on
    quality, also meant that Japanese tools tended to be more reliable than US tools.

  zh: 有了数控，美国机床制造商主要专注于市场的高端，利用计算机和其他技术的进步来创建能够追踪复杂路径、并根据客户需求定制机器的越来越精密的机器（这在美国机床行业很常见）。这种专注部分是由于空军和航空航天工业的指导作用，他们要求这些类型的机器生产先进零件。另一方面，日本制造商开发了更简单、更便宜的基于标准化设计的数控机器，针对之前无法证明昂贵数控机器成本的市场的大型、未开发的低端市场。并且对更简单、标准化设计的专注，再加上传统的日本注重质量，也意味着日本工具往往比美国工具更可靠。
- en: One example of Japanese standardization was controllers, the electronic components
    used to control the movement of the machine tools. In the US, there were many
    different suppliers of controllers, and many machine tool builders (like Cincinnati
    Milacron, Pratt and Whitney, and Warner and Swasey) offered their own, custom-built
    controllers to try and achieve a competitive advantage. In Japan, on the other
    hand, the market quickly became dominated by a single producer, FANUC. Not only
    were Japanese controllers cheaper, but a single standard likely meant that programming
    the machines and training people to use them was greatly simplified, as there
    was no re-learning process involved when switching to a different type of control.

    the US builders, but they were delivering them faster. Historically, machine tool
    companies had dealt with the cyclicality of the industry by acquiring a large
    backlog of orders, then working it down during the lean times when new orders
    slowed. When a customer ordered a new machine tool, it might take a year or two
    (or more) for it to be delivered. One US manufacturer of lathes noted that it
    built just one size of lathe a month: if you ordered a lathe in February that
    was only made in January, you’d have no choice but to wait a year for them to

- en: Conglomerates were often quick to divest their machine tool holdings when the

    whiplash as the firms tried to find their footing under new ownership. Storied
    machine tool manufacturer Warner and Swasey, for instance, was acquired by Bendix
    in 1980, which then sold it to Allied Corporation in 1983 as part of an effort
    to fight a hostile takeover from Martin Marietta. Just one year later in 1984,
    Allied then sold its machine tool group, including Warner and Swasey, to Cross
    and Trecker, which in turn was bought by Giddings and Lewis in 1991, which then
    decided to shut down Warner and Swasey the next year. This sort of management
    shuffling often took place at conglomerates even when ownership didn’t change,

    and Trecker，而后者于1991年被Giddings and Lewis收购，然后决定在次年关闭沃纳和斯瓦西。即使所有权没有发生变化，这种管理调整也经常发生在企业集团内部，因为公司在面对损失时试图重新组织以纠正他们所认为的正在下沉的船只。
