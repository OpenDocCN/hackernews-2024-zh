    causes are most likely related to the defunding of public goods, the casualization

    it has tended to be easier to suggest as a solution, not something like unionization
    or taxing the rich, but something like a PR campaign. And what makes Swift so
    ideal for that campaign is that hers is a kind of celebrity organized by relatability,

    Clinton）更值得研究呢？”

    world appeal” to Swift’s “real-world value” and how the “cultural war” of the
    1990s is more clearly, today, an economic war over resources, profits, and investments.
    What interests me is how the economic pressure of profitability has taken the
    new field of Swift studies in a different direction than the Madonna studies of
    the 1990s. If, as Cindy Patton says, Madonna studies was tied to new fields of
    theoretical study, what is surprising about the turn to Swift studies is the linking
    of a new musician with older methods and canons—the literature department’s bread
    and butter of close reading and Shakespeare. The course description for one of
    the first Swiftie courses, taught at UT Austin last fall, promises to “us[e] the
    songwriting of pop music icon Taylor Swift to introduce literary critical reading
    and research methods—basic skills for work in English literature and other humanities
    disciplines.” The ultimate learning objective for a course taught at NYU last
    spring: “Students will develop greater sophistication in their artistic appreciation,
