    least does not read just for kicks. But everyone knows newspaper subscriptions,
    library memberships, and college English enrollments are declining. Although the
    causes are most likely related to the defunding of public goods, the casualization
    of cultural labor, and the preemptive obsession with what is deemed profitable,
    it has tended to be easier to suggest as a solution, not something like unionization
    or taxing the rich, but something like a PR campaign. And what makes Swift so
    ideal for that campaign is that hers is a kind of celebrity organized by relatability,
    which means she invites her fans not to gawk but to imitate.

    matters, though, is how scholars did not so much apply it to Madonna as they did

    read as cynical plays at market relevance, were instead understood as performing
    the instability of identity itself, just as Judith Butler theorized as the power

    theoretical study, what is surprising about the turn to Swift studies is the linking
    of a new musician with older methods and canons—the literature department’s bread
    and butter of close reading and Shakespeare. The course description for one of
