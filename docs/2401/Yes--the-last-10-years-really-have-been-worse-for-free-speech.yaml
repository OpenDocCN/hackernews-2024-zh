- en: This makes it sound like we actually wrote, “Cancel Culture is worse than McCarthysim!”
    when we actually wrote something much more specific. We didn’t use the word “McCarthyism”
    in the book, but we did refer to that particular period of censorship as the Red
    Scare. Still, we only referenced that three times in the entire book. Once was
    to say that we believe people will study Cancel Culture the same way we study
    the Alien and Sedition Acts or the Red Scares (there were two). Another time was
    to point out that the Hollywood Red Scare only targeted about 300 people, in order
    to give people the sense of the comparative scale of Cancel Culture. In the third,
    we pointed out that there have been more professors fired during Cancel Culture
    than were fired during the Red Scare — which is simply true.
  id: totrans-9

  zh: 这让人觉得好像我们实际上写了“文化取消比麦卡锡主义更糟糕！”当我们实际上写了更具体的内容。我们在书中没有使用“麦卡锡主义”这个词，但我们确实提到了那个特定的审查时期称为“红色恐慌”。不过，我们在整本书中只提到了三次。一次是说我们相信人们将会像研究《外国人和煽动法案》或红色恐慌一样研究取消文化（红色恐慌有两次）。另一次是指出好莱坞的红色恐慌只针对了约300人，以便让人们了解取消文化的比较规模。第三次，我们指出在取消文化期间解雇的教授比红色恐慌期间被解雇的教授更多——这是事实。
- en: In fact, we refer in the book to 100-150 professors fired in the 11 years of
    the second Red Scare, and we compare that to the almost 200 that have been fired
    in the nine-and-a-half years of Cancel Culture (2014 - 2023). However, I realized
    later that counting 150 for the Red Scare was wrong, because that extra 50 was
    apparently just tacked on by people assuming the 100 estimate from [the largest
    study done in the ‘50s](https://archive.org/details/academicmindsoci0000laza/mode/2up)
    must be larger. I am confident that more than 100 professors were fired, but you
    need to compare what the estimate was *at the time of the second Red Scare* with
    what the estimate is now, while Cancel Culture is actually occurring. Doubtlessly,
    additional people will come forward over time, and I believe that the same thing
    will happen for Cancel Culture — and probably on an even larger scale once people
    become less worried about the NDAs they had to sign. Regardless, comparing 100
    fired professors then to nearly 200 now, with about a year and a half’s difference
    in favor of the second Red Scare, still makes my point.

  zh: 事实上，我们在书中提到了第二次红色恐慌期间有100-150名教授被解雇，而我们将这个数字与“文化取消”期间九年半内几乎有200名教授被解雇进行了比较（2014年至2023年）。然而，后来我意识到，将第二次红色恐慌期间的解雇数计为150是错误的，因为这额外的50名教授显然只是人们假设50年代最大的研究中估计的100名教授可能会更多。我确信超过100名教授被解雇，但您需要比较第二次红色恐慌时的估计数字与当前“文化取消”时期的情况。毫无疑问，随着时间的推移，将会有更多人站出来，我相信对于“文化取消”也会发生同样的事情——也许规模甚至更大，一旦人们不再担心他们必须签署的保密协议。尽管如此，将那时的100名被解雇的教授与现在近200名的情况进行比较，第二次红色恐慌领先约一年半，这仍然能够说明我的观点。
- en: Most importantly, whenever I’ve talked about Cancel Culture since, I’ve been
    pretty clear that I’m talking about *on campus*, not the country as a whole. The
    numbers on campus *are* alarming, and the statements Rikki and I make bear that
    out. For example, as my colleague Adam Goldstein and I detailed in a [piece for
    Fox News](https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/almost-1-in-10-college-students-threatened-punishment-their-speech-study),
    [1 in 10 students surveyed for FIRE](https://www.thefire.org/research-learn/2023-student-experiences-survey-fire-and-college-pulse)
    report that they've been either threatened with punishment and investigation or
    actually have been punished or investigated for their speech. Extrapolated out
    to the entire population on campus, that amounts to more than one million students
    nationwide. And a [2022 survey of college faculty](https://www.thefire.org/research-learn/academic-mind-2022-what-faculty-think-about-free-expression-and-academic-freedom)
    showed that 1 in 6 reported having either been threatened with punishment or investigated
    for their academic freedom or free speech, which equals tens of thousands of professors.
    There is no evidence that the Red Scare threatened professors and students with
    official sanction on anything like that scale.

  zh: 最重要的是，自从我谈论“文化取消”以来，我一直很清楚我指的是*校园内*，而不是整个国家。校园内的数字*令人担忧*，我和 Rikki 所做的声明证实了这一点。例如，正如我的同事亚当·戈德斯坦和我在
    [福克斯新闻](https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/almost-1-in-10-college-students-threatened-punishment-their-speech-study)

    表明，有十分之一的学生报告称他们曾因言论而受到威胁或调查，甚至被处罚或调查。若将这一数据推广至整个校园人口，全国范围内的学生超过一百万人。而一项针对大学教师的
    [2022 年调查](https://www.thefire.org/research-learn/academic-mind-2022-what-faculty-think-about-free-expression-and-academic-freedom)
    显示，六分之一的教师报告曾因其学术自由或言论自由而受到威胁或调查，这相当于数以万计的教授。没有证据显示红色恐慌威胁到教授和学生的官方处罚规模有如此之大。
- en: And keep in mind that prior to the case law decided *after* the Red Scare, from
    1957 to 1973, it wasn’t even clear that the First Amendment prevented public colleges
    from firing professors or expelling students for speech or beliefs. We make this
    point repeatedly in the book because professors and students are now *supposed*

    coverage of these laws, but it really was the only one applied to higher ed and
    the only one that impacted classroom instruction. And as I mentioned earlier,

    a magistrate judge has already said it should be enjoined as unconstitutional)
    — but that gets very, very little media coverage even though it does something
    that’s arguably worse: Compelling professors to promote ideas they may not agree
    with. These include acknowledging that “cultural and social identities are diverse,
    fluid, and intersectional,” and developing “knowledge of the intersectionality
    of social identities and the multiple axes of oppression that people from different

- en: In his review of “Canceling,” Cole goes on to mention the “Don’t Say Gay” bill
    in Florida — which we also criticize in the book — as a comparable act from the
    political Right. This comparison doesn’t work, however, because the “Don’t Say
    Gay” bill deals specifically with K-12 curriculum. The state generally has — and,
    [I believe, should have](https://www.thefire.org/news/blogs/eternally-radical-idea/13-important-points-campus-k-12-critical-race-theory-debate)
    — some say in what public schools (which are mandatory, taxpayer funded, and educate
    our children) teach. While Cole, as well as Rikki and I, have every reason to
    be critical of many of these laws applied to the K-12 curriculum, legally speaking,
    they are quite distinct from the very clear speech-protective laws regarding higher
    education.

  zh: 在对《取消》的评论中，科尔还提到了佛罗里达州的“不要说同性恋”法案——我们在书中也批评了——作为政治右翼的一种可比较的行为。 然而，这种比较并不成立，因为“不要说同性恋”法案专门涉及K-12课程。国家通常应该在公立学校（这些学校是强制性的、由纳税人资助的，并教育我们的子女）教授什么方面发表意见。虽然科尔以及Rikki和我有很多理由批评这些适用于K-12课程的法律，但从法律上讲，它们与关于高等教育的非常明确的言论保护法律有很大区别。
- en: There has also been, not by Cole [but by others,](https://www.chronicle.com/article/the-political-machine-behind-the-war-on-academic-freedom)
    some conflation of the laws that require universities to cut down on their DEI
    bureaucracy. To the extent that those limit the rights of professors and students,
    FIRE adamantly opposes them — but some of these laws are quite clearly directed
    only at the bureaucracy itself. And every time that gets mentioned, free speech
    defenders should note that DEI administrators and bureaucracies have been threats
    to free speech, academic freedom, and the marketplace of ideas on many many campuses,

  zh: 有些人（并非科尔本人）也有一些混淆，即大学需要削减其DEI官僚机构的法律。 在这些法律限制教授和学生权利的程度上，FIRE坚决反对它们——但是其中一些法律显然只针对官僚体系本身。每次提到这一点时，言论自由捍卫者都应该注意到，DEI行政人员和官僚机构一直是许多校园言论自由、学术自由和思想市场的威胁，正如我上周所写的那样。
- en: Guilty as charged here — and I think this may be  just a difference of opinion
    between me and David Cole. We at FIRE have defeated scores of speech codes and
    saved countless professors and students from punishments for their clearly protected
    speech, but that doesn’t mean we don’t still have a major free speech problem
    on campus. When it comes to tuition costs, bureaucracy, and viewpoint diversity
    — before you even get to the major threats to academic freedom and free speech
    — higher ed is in bad shape and needs major reform.

  zh: 在这里我认罪不讳——我认为这可能只是我和大卫·科尔之间意见的分歧。我们在FIRE已经击败了许多言论规定，并拯救了无数教授和学生，使他们免受对其明确受保护的言论的惩罚，但这并不意味着我们在校园里没有重大的言论自由问题。在谈论学费、官僚主义和观点多样性之前——甚至在谈论学术自由和言论自由的主要威胁之前——高等教育的状况很糟，需要进行重大改革。
- en: The beginning of a solution is [not the same thing](https://www.thefire.org/news/more-one-year-later-no-funding-cuts-so-far-wesleyan-student-paper)
    as the end of a problem. We have seen proposals to help with the free speech environments
    on campuses come and go (and go, and go) over the years. As we saw in the late
    ‘90s and ‘00s, defeated speech codes often come back. Sometimes they are verbatim
    to ones that were defeated in court. Schools that have changed policies to respect
    civil rights when donors are mad also tend to backslide as soon as students are
    angry enough at a professor’s or fellow student’s speech. Administrators who champion
    free expression retire and are replaced by administrators with other concerns.
    Many well-intentioned programs aimed at solving the problem also have no effect
    on the campus climate at all.

  zh: 解决方案的开始并不等同于问题的结束。多年来，我们看到了许多旨在改善校园言论自由环境的提案来来去去。正如我们在90年代末和00年代看到的，被击败的言论规定往往会卷土重来。有时，它们与法院中被击败的规定一字不差。当捐赠者生气时改变政策以尊重公民权利的学校，一旦学生对教授或同学的言论足够生气，他们往往会倒退。捍卫言论自由的管理人员退休后，会被其他问题关心的管理人员取代。许多旨在解决问题的善意计划在校园氛围上根本没有任何影响。
- en: I am aware of some of the programs Cole references, and I do hold out some small
    hope for them. But as long as schools maintain DEI requirements in their admissions
    and hiring essays, maintain “bias related incident” teams, flirt with or straight
    up employ restrictive speech codes on campus, have literally no viewpoint diversity
    in many departments, and remain places where so many students and faculty are
    afraid of saying what they really think and being investigated for their speech,
    we are nowhere near the finish line.
