    of my and Rikki Schlott’s book, “[The Canceling of the American Mind](https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/The-Canceling-of-the-American-Mind/Greg-Lukianoff/9781668019146),”
    coming out in the February 8 edition of the New York Review of Books. Overall
    I thought it was quite positive, but Cole made some arguments — which we actually
    hear quite often — that I think need addressing.

    thinker on the topic of freedom of speech to review our book, as opposed to the
    many First Amendment skeptics these days who seem to think that simply employing
    a more advanced insult technology against those they disagree with is the same
    as refuting them (cough, cough — “[The Lost Cause of Free Speech](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4374803)”).

    when we actually wrote something much more specific. We didn’t use the word “McCarthyism”
    in the book, but we did refer to that particular period of censorship as the Red
    Scare. Still, we only referenced that three times in the entire book. Once was
    to say that we believe people will study Cancel Culture the same way we study
    the Alien and Sedition Acts or the Red Scares (there were two). Another time was
    to point out that the Hollywood Red Scare only targeted about 300 people, in order
    to give people the sense of the comparative scale of Cancel Culture. In the third,
    we pointed out that there have been more professors fired during Cancel Culture
    than were fired during the Red Scare — which is simply true.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In fact, we refer in the book to 100-150 professors fired in the 11 years of
    the second Red Scare, and we compare that to the almost 200 that have been fired
    in the nine-and-a-half years of Cancel Culture (2014 - 2023). However, I realized
    later that counting 150 for the Red Scare was wrong, because that extra 50 was
    apparently just tacked on by people assuming the 100 estimate from [the largest
    study done in the ‘50s](https://archive.org/details/academicmindsoci0000laza/mode/2up)
    must be larger. I am confident that more than 100 professors were fired, but you
    need to compare what the estimate was *at the time of the second Red Scare* with
    what the estimate is now, while Cancel Culture is actually occurring. Doubtlessly,
    additional people will come forward over time, and I believe that the same thing
    will happen for Cancel Culture — and probably on an even larger scale once people
    become less worried about the NDAs they had to sign. Regardless, comparing 100
    fired professors then to nearly 200 now, with about a year and a half’s difference
    in favor of the second Red Scare, still makes my point.

    pretty clear that I’m talking about *on campus*, not the country as a whole. The
    numbers on campus *are* alarming, and the statements Rikki and I make bear that
    out. For example, as my colleague Adam Goldstein and I detailed in a [piece for
    Fox News](https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/almost-1-in-10-college-students-threatened-punishment-their-speech-study),
    [1 in 10 students surveyed for FIRE](https://www.thefire.org/research-learn/2023-student-experiences-survey-fire-and-college-pulse)
    report that they've been either threatened with punishment and investigation or
    actually have been punished or investigated for their speech. Extrapolated out
    to the entire population on campus, that amounts to more than one million students
    nationwide. And a [2022 survey of college faculty](https://www.thefire.org/research-learn/academic-mind-2022-what-faculty-think-about-free-expression-and-academic-freedom)
    showed that 1 in 6 reported having either been threatened with punishment or investigated
    for their academic freedom or free speech, which equals tens of thousands of professors.
    There is no evidence that the Red Scare threatened professors and students with
    official sanction on anything like that scale.

    1957 to 1973, it wasn’t even clear that the First Amendment prevented public colleges
    from firing professors or expelling students for speech or beliefs. We make this
    point repeatedly in the book because professors and students are now *supposed*
    to be protected by the First Amendment, and yet we *still* see investigations
    and firings on an unprecedented scale.

    we are arguing that Cancel Culture should be thought of as a particular historical
    period, not just a general, all-purpose term for any kind of censorship or ostracism.
    A lot of times the argument, “But Cancel Culture goes way back!” is really just
    another way of saying that censorship, exclusion, and closed-mindedness are ancient.
