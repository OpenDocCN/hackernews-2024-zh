    in our Vancouver Special, a mainstay structure in the city’s residential areas.
    Once deemed boxy and cookie cutter, the architectural equivalent of a Honda Element,
    Vancouver Specials are now touted for their ability to accommodate two households,
    one on each floor. I’m in the kitchen, making my eight-year-old’s school lunch,

    arrangement had served us well since we all moved in together in 2021, a decision
    made with my wife’s approval. My mom had been on her own since my brother married

    is a norm for older people in Africa, Asia, and Latin America and the Caribbean.
    Some scholars argue that, in the United States and in Britain, the nuclear family
    is a relatively new phenomenon that occurred as industrialization splintered extended
    households and drove them from their farms to cities in the late nineteenth and
    early twentieth centuries. In other places, that shift never occurred. The UN
    report found that over 90 percent of seniors live with family in Afghanistan and
    Pakistan.

    according to the 2021 census, a number that has swollen by about 50 percent since
    2001\. The figure would increase further if we expanded the idea of multigenerational
    living to include families residing in adjacent properties, such as laneway homes.
    Last January, the Trudeau government began offering a multigenerational home renovation
    tax credit at an estimated cost of $44 million over the next five years. That
    month, a *Globe and Mail* headline [proclaimed](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/real-estate/vancouver/article-2023-is-shaping-up-to-be-the-year-of-multigenerational-ownership/)

    line is clear, and there may be no going back.

    13.5 percent of all households are multigenerational.'

    dwellings built for extended families have been tarred as “monster homes.” One
    seething missive to the *Province* in 2009 described Surrey’s monster homes as
    “eyesores . . . riddled with garbage and with numerous cars in the driveway and
    on the street.” Bending over to similar uproar, some Canadian cities have cracked
    down on “illegal suites” and lowered the maximum allowable square footage in residential
    neighbourhoods. A middle-aged friend of mine who grew up in East Vancouver recalled
    that his family didn’t have cable at their house for a period of time because
    their service provider had determined that the cable splitter they used to share
    their TV signal with his grandparents was against company policy.

    Saltair, a community on the east coast of Vancouver Island. Lorimer and her husband
    also have a forty-one-year-old son, who lives on their twelve-acre property. Lorimer
    and her daughter cooked meals together, while her son-in-law helped with yard

    violent toward them—defined in the study as “[being] screamed at, insulted, threatened,
