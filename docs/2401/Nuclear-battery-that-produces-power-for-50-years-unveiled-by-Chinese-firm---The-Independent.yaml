    realise the miniaturisation of atomic energy, placing nickel-63 isotopes into
    a module smaller than a coin.

- en: The company said the [next-generation battery](https://www.independent.co.uk/tech/battery-charge-record-harvard-b2476344.html)
    had already entered the pilot testing stage and will eventually be mass produced
    for commercial applications like phones and drones.

    long-lasting power supply in multiple scenarios, such as aerospace, AI equipment,
    medical equipment, microprocessors, advanced sensors, small drones and micro-robots,”
    the firm said in a press release.

    for use in spacecraft, underwater systems and remote scientific stations, however
    the thermonuclear batteries were both costly and bulky.

    China’s 14th Five-Year Plan designed to strengthen the country’s economy between
    2021 and 2025, while research institutions in the US and Europe are also working
    on their development.

- en: Betavolt said its first nuclear battery can deliver 100 microwatts of power
    and a voltage of 3V, while measuring 15x15x5 cubic millimetres, however it plans
    to produce a battery with 1 watt of power by 2025.

    the company imagining mobile phones that never need to be charged and drones that
    can fly forever. Its layered design also means it will not catch fire or explode
    in response to sudden force, Betavolt claims, while also being capable of working
    in temperatures ranging from -60C to 120C.

    external radiation, and is suitable for use in medical devices such as pacemakers,
    artificial hearts and cochleas in the human body,” the company said.

    the 63 isotopes turn into a stable isotope of copper, which is non-radioactive
    and does not pose any threat or pollution to the environment.
