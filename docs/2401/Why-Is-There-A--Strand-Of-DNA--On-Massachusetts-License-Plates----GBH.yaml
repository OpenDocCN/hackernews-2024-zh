    listeners about the things — large and small —that are rousing their curiosity.
    Inspiration for today's story comes courtesy of Worcester resident Richard Klein.

- en: On Massachusetts license plates, there’s a pattern going vertically down the
    center of the plate — looks kind of like a double helix, and I’m just curious
    why it’s there.

- en: 'It turns out, this ghostly, gray double helix has an official name: the “Ensure
    Virtual Security Thread.” It was created by 3M, a  company in the midwest that
    you might know as the makers of Scotch Tape and Post-It Notes, but who think of
    themselves a bit more broadly.'

    Business Manager for 3M''s Vehicle Materials division. "We think of ourselves
    as innovation at our core."'

    that has stood the test of time: Retroreflective sheeting.'

- en: '"Retroreflectivity is actually accomplished using glass beads or microscopic
    prisms to return the light," explained Ede. "Light would actually come into the
    sheeting and bounce around the beads or the prisms and then get sent back out."'

    plates in the 1940s. It’s why both objects appear to light up when your headlights
    hit them.

    from greater distances and enables holograms on driver’s licenses. It's also also
    what allowed the effects team at Industrial Light and Magic to create the iconic
    lightsabers in the original "Star Wars" back in 1977.

    sheeting for license plates — a security feature aimed at curbing counterfeiters.

    explained Ede. "And they can detect counterfeit plates before they approach the
    vehicle."'

    for its unique properties, devised and designed by experts in their film, imaging
    and light management divisions.

    "It''s very easy for authorities to see, but it’s very difficult to simulate and
    counterfeit."'

    license plate. The whole plate lit up. And while I’m not so sure I’d call it a
    floating image, the security thread was nevertheless highly visible, especially
    from about eight feet away. And as I approached the plate, something interesting
    happened about three feet out. The security thread disappeared, and three circles, with
    letters and numbers inside them, emerged.

    states also add their own custom security features like this to the standard-issue
    Ensure Virtual Security Thread.

    license plate. And with the [Sumner Tunnel closure](https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en&q=bob+seay+sumner+tunnel&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8),
    and the [Green Line Extension shutting down](https://www.wgbh.org/news/local-news/2023/06/30/green-line-extension-to-union-square-will-close-for-6-weeks),
    chances are you’ll be spending more time than you’d like in traffic this summer,
    so why not use this opportunity to get acquainted with the back of the car in
    front of you?
