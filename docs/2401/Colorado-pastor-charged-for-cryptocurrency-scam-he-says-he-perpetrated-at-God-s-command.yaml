- en: A Colorado-based pastor for an online ministry sold INDXcoin to his followers
    and others in the Christian faith. However, there was no way for buyers to cash
    out the tokens. Meanwhile, Regalado and his wife spent the money on a Rolls Royce,
    jewelry, and designer handbags — and, according to Regalado, "a home renovation
    the Lord told us to do."

  zh: 一位科罗拉多州的在线事工牧师向他的追随者和其他基督教信徒出售了INDXcoin。然而，买家无法兑现代币。与此同时，Regalado 和他的妻子用这笔钱买了劳斯莱斯、珠宝和设计师手袋——据
    Regalado 说，还进行了“上帝告诉我们要做的一次家庭装修”。
- en: Regalado posted a video to his supporters explaining that he had been sued by
    the Colorado state securities regulator. "So the charges are that Kaitlyn and
    I pocketed $1.3 million, and I just want to come out and say that those uh charges
    are true," said Regalado in the video, presumably causing a cold chill to run
    down the spine of his defense attorney in the middle of whatever he was doing.

  zh: Regalado 向支持者发布了一段视频，解释说他被科罗拉多州证券监管机构起诉了。“所以指控是我和 Kaitlyn 收了 130 万美元，我只想出来说那些，嗯，指控是真的，”Regalado
    在视频中说道，这可能让他的辩护律师毛骨悚然，不知道正在做什么的时候。
- en: According to Regalado, God told them to first invest in a separate coin, which
    turned out to be a scam. Then, says Regalado, God told him to make his own currency,
    which Regalado called INDXcoin, "but also give them a 10x". Who knew God was a
    [degen](/glossary#degen)! Regalado had told investors that the funds would be
    going to "widows and orphans", but spent most of it on himself and his wife.

  zh: 据 Regalado 说，上帝告诉他们首先投资于一种另类币，结果证明是一场骗局。然后，Regalado 说，上帝告诉他自己制造他自己的货币，Regalado
    称之为 INDXcoin，“但也给他们 10 倍”。谁知道上帝是个[degen](/glossary#degen)！Regalado 告诉投资者资金将用于“寡妇和孤儿”，但大部分花在了他和他妻子身上。
