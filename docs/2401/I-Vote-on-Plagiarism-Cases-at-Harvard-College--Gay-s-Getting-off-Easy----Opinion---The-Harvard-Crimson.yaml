- en: In my time on the Council, I heard dozens of cases. When students — my classmates,
    peers, and friends — appear before the council, they are distraught. For most,
    it is the worst day of their college careers. For some, it is the worst day of
    their lives. They often cry.

- en: A plurality of the Honor Council’s investigations concern plagiarism. In the
    2021-22 school year, the last year for which data is publicly available, [43 percent
    of cases involved plagiarism](https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2023/5/22/harvard-honor-council-2021-2022/)
    or misuse of sources.

  zh: 不带引号、引用来源不完整或根本不引用来源都被哈佛定义为抄袭。
- en: In my experience, when students omit quotation marks and citations, as President
    Gay did, the sanction is usually one term of probation — a permanent mark on a
    student’s record. A student on probation is no longer considered in good standing,
    disqualifying them from opportunities like fellowships and study-abroad programs.
    Good standing is also required to receive a degree.

  zh: 从我的经验来看，当学生省略引号和引用，就像 Gay 校长所做的那样，惩罚通常是一个学期的缓刑——学生记录上永久记载的标记。缓刑的学生不再被视为处于良好地位，这使他们无法获得奖学金和海外学习项目等机会。良好地位也是获得学位所必需的。

  zh: 对于针对 Gay 总统的抄袭指控，引人关注的是违规行为是例行且普遍的。
- en: She is accused of plagiarism in her dissertation and at least two of her 11
    journal articles. Two sentences from the acknowledgement section of her dissertation
    even seem to have been copied from another work.

  zh: 她被指控在她的论文和至少两篇她的 11 篇期刊文章中存在抄袭行为。甚至她论文致谢部分中的两句话似乎是从另一篇作品中抄袭而来的。
- en: According to the Honor Council’s procedures, the response to a violation depends
    on the “seriousness of the infraction” and “extenuating circumstances, including
    the extent to which a student has had similar trouble before.” In other words,
    while a single lifted paragraph could be blamed on a lapse in judgment, a pattern
    is more concerning.

  zh: 根据荣誉委员会的程序，对违规行为的反应取决于“违规行为的严重性”和“重要情节，包括学生以前是否有类似困扰”。换句话说，虽然一个提取的段落可能是由于判断失误，但一连串的情况更为令人担忧。
- en: In my experience, when a student is found responsible for multiple separate
    Honor Code violations, they are generally required to withdraw — i.e., suspended
    — from the College for two semesters. Since the Council was established in 2015,
    roughly 16 percent of students who have appeared before us have been required
    to withdraw.

- en: It is a serious thing for the Council to render this judgment, and I have never
    taken any such vote lightly. Voting to suspend a peer with whom I might share
    a dorm, club, or class is not easy. We have even voted to suspend seniors just
    about to graduate.

- en: It may be true that the plagiarism allegations against President Gay fall short
    of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences’ interim policy on research misconduct. She
    may not have “intentionally, knowingly, and recklessly” tried to represent the
    work of her doctoral advisor and others as her own. And there is no evidence that
    any of her arguments posited as original contributions were plagiarized.

  zh: 对于 Gay 总统的抄袭指控可能不符合艺术与科学学院关于研究不端的临时政策。她可能没有“故意、知情和鲁莽地”试图将她的博士导师和其他人的工作代表为自己的。而且没有证据表明她提出的任何原创性贡献的论点是剽窃的。
- en: But President Gay’s pattern of mistakes is serious, and the Harvard Corporation
    should not minimize these allegations of plagiarism, [as it has readily done](https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2023/12/12/gay-stays-in-office-corporation-support/).

- en: In a Dec. 12 University-wide letter, the Corporation described the alleged plagiarism
    as “a few instances of inadequate citation.” The letter lauded President Gay for
    “proactively” correcting her articles by inserting citations and quotation marks.

  zh: 在 12 月 12 日的全校信中，理事会将所谓的剽窃描述为“几个不足引文的例子”。该信赞扬了 Gay 总统“主动”通过插入引文和引号来纠正她的文章。
- en: By definition, Gay’s corrections were not proactive but reactive — she only
    made them after she was caught. And that the Corporation considers her corrections
    an adequate response is not fair to undergraduates, who cannot simply submit corrections
    to avoid penalties.

  zh: 从定义上来看，Gay 的更正不是主动的而是被动的 —— 她只是在被发现后才做出了更正。理事会认为她的更正是足够的回应并不公平，对于本科生来说，他们无法简单地提交更正以避免处罚。
- en: When my peers are found responsible for multiple instances of inadequate citation,
    they are often suspended for an academic year. When the president of their university
    is found responsible for the same types of infractions, the fellows of the Corporation
