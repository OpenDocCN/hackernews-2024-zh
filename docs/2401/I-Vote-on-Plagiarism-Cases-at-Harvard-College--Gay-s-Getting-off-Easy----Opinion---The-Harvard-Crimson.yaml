    tasked with upholding the College’s community standards of academic integrity.

- en: In my time on the Council, I heard dozens of cases. When students — my classmates,
    peers, and friends — appear before the council, they are distraught. For most,
    it is the worst day of their college careers. For some, it is the worst day of
    their lives. They often cry.

    be, and still think them necessary, that I call on University President Claudine
    Gay to resign for her numerous and serious violations of academic ethics.

- en: A plurality of the Honor Council’s investigations concern plagiarism. In the
    2021-22 school year, the last year for which data is publicly available, [43 percent
    of cases involved plagiarism](https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2023/5/22/harvard-honor-council-2021-2022/)
    or misuse of sources.

    at all constitutes plagiarism according to Harvard’s definitions.

- en: In my experience, when students omit quotation marks and citations, as President
    Gay did, the sanction is usually one term of probation — a permanent mark on a
    student’s record. A student on probation is no longer considered in good standing,
    disqualifying them from opportunities like fellowships and study-abroad programs.
    Good standing is also required to receive a degree.

    that the improprieties are routine and pervasive.

    journal articles. Two sentences from the acknowledgement section of her dissertation
    even seem to have been copied from another work.

- en: According to the Honor Council’s procedures, the response to a violation depends
    on the “seriousness of the infraction” and “extenuating circumstances, including
    the extent to which a student has had similar trouble before.” In other words,
    while a single lifted paragraph could be blamed on a lapse in judgment, a pattern
    is more concerning.

- en: In my experience, when a student is found responsible for multiple separate
    Honor Code violations, they are generally required to withdraw — i.e., suspended
    — from the College for two semesters. Since the Council was established in 2015,
    roughly 16 percent of students who have appeared before us have been required
    to withdraw.

    taken any such vote lightly. Voting to suspend a peer with whom I might share
    a dorm, club, or class is not easy. We have even voted to suspend seniors just
    about to graduate.

    academic integrity. Cheating on exams is not okay. Plagiarism is not okay.

- en: It may be true that the plagiarism allegations against President Gay fall short
    of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences’ interim policy on research misconduct. She
    may not have “intentionally, knowingly, and recklessly” tried to represent the
    work of her doctoral advisor and others as her own. And there is no evidence that
    any of her arguments posited as original contributions were plagiarized.

    should not minimize these allegations of plagiarism, [as it has readily done](https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2023/12/12/gay-stays-in-office-corporation-support/).

- en: In a Dec. 12 University-wide letter, the Corporation described the alleged plagiarism
    as “a few instances of inadequate citation.” The letter lauded President Gay for
    “proactively” correcting her articles by inserting citations and quotation marks.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: By definition, Gay’s corrections were not proactive but reactive — she only
    made them after she was caught. And that the Corporation considers her corrections
    an adequate response is not fair to undergraduates, who cannot simply submit corrections
    to avoid penalties.

- en: When my peers are found responsible for multiple instances of inadequate citation,
    they are often suspended for an academic year. When the president of their university
    is found responsible for the same types of infractions, the fellows of the Corporation
    “unanimously stand in support of” her.

    our University’s president. The Corporation should resolve the double standard
    by demanding her resignation.
