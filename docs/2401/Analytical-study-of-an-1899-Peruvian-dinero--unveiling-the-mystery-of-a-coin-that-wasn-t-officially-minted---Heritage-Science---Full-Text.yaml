    As observed, it is a coin with high degree of wear, where the devices and lettering
    are not very clear, in strong contrast with the slightly circulated contemporary
    coin shown in Fig. [1](/articles/10.1186/s40494-023-01092-2#Fig1)a(iv). The wear
    patterns (surface pits and scratches, Fig. [1](/articles/10.1186/s40494-023-01092-2#Fig1)b)
    are consistent with a coin that circulated more than 100 years ago. At first glance,
    this coin cannot be distinguished from a dirty and/or a highly worn coin of the
    time (Fig. [1](/articles/10.1186/s40494-023-01092-2#Fig1)a (ii) and (iii), respectively).

    This is important because, in such a small coin, most users would probably be

    pass the coin unnoticed.'

    *dineros* depicted in Fig. [1](/articles/10.1186/s40494-023-01092-2#Fig1)a. As
    observed, the main metals in the genuine circulated coins are silver and copper
    (as expected), whereas in the 1899 coin the main peaks correspond to copper, nickel
    and zinc. Minor peaks of potassium, calcium, iron, cobalt and lead (almost imperceptible)
    were also observed in the 1899 *dinero*. Calcium, potassium and iron are usually
    associated with surface dirt but the iron peak area is above the quantification
    limits so it is probably part of the coin’s alloy (partly could be dirt). The
    presence of iron and nickel in silver coins is associated to the instrument background
    (their area under the peaks are nearly identical to those observed in the BNF-C30.10.2
    standard, Additional file [1](/articles/10.1186/s40494-023-01092-2#MOESM1): Table
    S1, with less than 50 ppm of Fe and 100 ppm of Ni). The presence of cobalt and
    lead can be associated with the coin’s alloy. When measured near the rim (or coin
    border), some XRF spectra of the 1899 coin showed the presence of silver traces
    (Fig. [3](/articles/10.1186/s40494-023-01092-2#Fig3)b, inset) so its chemical
    composition was calculated from XRF data collected on three different points as
    close to the center as possible, to avoid silver peaks. In this regard, cobalt
    could not be precisely determined and is expected to be around 500 ppm as the
    peak area analysis of the two available standards containing cobalt (36X-CN23,
    with 500 ppm and 31X-B8-J2, having 75 ppm) resulted in statistically identical

    deeper into this aspect, the spectrum obtained for the dinero coin was compared
    with that obtained for different nickel-silver objects, including some counterfeit
    and genuine coins.These objects (see Additional file [1](/articles/10.1186/s40494-023-01092-2#MOESM1):

    the end of the twentieth century. The spectra are shown in Fig. [4](/articles/10.1186/s40494-023-01092-2#Fig4).
    As can be seen, the central part of the spectra (Ni/Cu/Zn signals) is very similar
    in all cases but differs on the sides. There are no lead signals at the higher
    energy end of the spectra in the most recent objects (upper half of the figure)
    but are common in older objects. On the lower energy region, iron peaks are usually
    more intense in old objects, in which cobalt and manganese metals are also more
    common. These observations reduce the possibility of a recent manufacture of the
    coin and are consistent with an alloy prepared in the nineteenth century. The
    composition of the contemporary genuine silver coins was not calculated in this
    research but their spectra are consistent with that expected for a 90% (or higher)

    of silvering was initially explored using SEM EDX. The SEM EDX study focused on
    the obverse (the side of the coat of arms) given that it was the most blackened
    side. Consequently, if the coin had been silvered, this side would be the most
    plausible place for finding this metal. Figure [5](/articles/10.1186/s40494-023-01092-2#Fig5)

    Fig. [4](/articles/10.1186/s40494-023-01092-2#Fig4)d, clearly indicates the presence
