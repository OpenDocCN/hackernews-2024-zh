    Hundreds of individuals who operated Post Office branches (subpostmasters) were
    convicted on fraud and theft charges on the basis of missing funds identified
    by the Horizon accounting system. Thousands more subpostmasters were forced to
    pay the Post Office back for these shortfalls. But the Post Office trial concluded
    that [Horizon was “not remotely robust”](https://www.benthamsgaze.org/2019/12/19/resolving-disputes-through-computer-evidence-lessons-from-the-post-office-trial/),
    and the supposed shortfalls might never have existed in the first place and, where
    they did, they might not have been due to the fault of the subpostmaster.

    4 March 2010 where a SPM had tried, on 2 March 2010, to transfer out £4,000 (referred
    to in the PEAK as 4,000 pds, which means either pounds (plural) or pounds sterling)
    from an individual stock unit into the shared main stock unit when the system
    crashed. The SPM was then issued with 2 x £4,000 receipts. These two receipts
    had the same session number. The PEAK, as one would expect, records various matters
    in note form and also uses informal shorthand. However, the main thrust is that
    when the SPM did the cash declaration, although the main stock unit (into which
    the £4,000 was being transferred) “was fine”, the unit from which the cash was
    taken “was out by 4000 pounds (a loss of 4000 pds)”. This is very similar to what
    Mr Latif said had happened to him, although the transfer in July 2015 to which
    he referred was £2,000\. The PEAK related to Horizon Online and was the admitted
    occasion when the Balancing Transaction tool had been used.

    as issues 3, 4, 5 and 6 under the same heading of entry 8 in the Bug Table. Issue
    3 applied to two PEAKs, both from 2000\. They were PC0052575 (in which the SPM
    reported discrepancies of £20 and £628.25) and the issue was diagnosed as arising
    out of the use of a shared stock unit. The Post Office submissions were “There
    is a window of time between a user printing and cutting-off a report. If another
    user was to perform a transaction during that window, that transaction may not
    show on the report. The issue was already due to be fixed in a future release”.
    Mr Coyne accepted in cross-examination that these were indications of a discrepancy
    being identified, but these were not of themselves evidence of a bug in Horizon.
    His overall evidence on this was contained in his final answer which was “It created
    a financial discrepancy within the Horizon system which could then ultimately
    have an impact on branch accounts.” I accept that this issue caused a financial
    discrepancy. Given the issue was “due to be fixed” in what is described as a “future
    release” the issue arose from the operation of the system and is therefore, in
    my judgment, correctly described as a defect.

    The replacement counter started writing messages from the point at which it believed
    it had replicated all relevant messages from its neighbour. This meant that it
    used message IDs that had been used for messages that had not been replicated
    from its neighbour and this prevented the “missing” messages from being replicated

    Credence, including weak change controls within the back-end of the systems which
    allowed Logica developers (the third-party provider) to move their own uncontrolled
    changes into the production environment, which included both Credence software
    code and the data within Credence used for what was called “audit evidence” but
    which has to be differentiated from what I am referring to audit records in the
    audit store. There was a lack of further documentation to approve fixes and patches
    applied to Credence outside of the release process, which meant that linking changes
    to issue tickets to record the original request for the bug fix was not possible.

    年 3 月的 E&Y 回顾发现了 Credence 存在的各种问题，包括系统后端的弱变更控制，这使得 Logica 开发人员（第三方提供商）能够将自己的未受控制的变更移入生产环境，这些变更包括
    Credence 软件代码和用于所谓“审计证据”的 Credence 内部数据，但必须将其与我所指的审计存储中的审计记录区分开。缺乏进一步的文件来批准应用于
    Credence 的修复和补丁，这意味着无法将更改链接到问题票据以记录原始的错误修复请求。

    statement, it can be seen how far from this joint agreed (and technically justified)
    position the Horizon system was. The logging of Privileged User Access (in PUA
    logs) commenced in October 2009\. For the period 2009 to 2015 – obviously a 6
    year period – these logs only displayed the fact that a Privileged User had logged
    on or off, “but not what actions they had taken whilst the Privileged User was
    logged in”. Therefore the actions they were taking when logged in were being neither
    recorded nor audited. All that could be seen is they were logged in. Further,
    it has already been seen that the number of users with the relevant privileges
    was not, in my judgment, restricted to a minimum. Further, the use of the Transaction
    Correction Tool cannot be seen in these logs. Yet further, the experts are agreed
    that at all times, any privileged user access log only shows what tables of BRDB
    were accessed for a very small minority of accesses.

  zh: 然而，当然考虑了第 4 位专家声明的后续段落，可以看出 Horizon 系统离这个共同同意的（并在技术上证明合理的）立场有多远。特权用户访问（在 PUA
    日志中）的记录始于 2009 年 10 月。对于 2009 年至 2015 年的时期 - 显然是一个 6 年的时期 - 这些日志只显示了特权用户登录或退出的事实，“但没有记录他们登录后执行的操作”。因此，在他们登录时执行的操作既没有记录也没有审核。能够看到的只是他们已经登录。此外，已经看到具有相关特权的用户数量在我看来并未受到限制。此外，在这些日志中无法看到交易校正工具的使用。更进一步，专家们一致认为，任何特权用户访问日志始终只显示了
    BRDB 表的少数极小部分访问时期的内容。

- en: This stance was maintained by the Post Office in the evidence served on its
    behalf for the Horizon Issues trial, until service of Mr Roll’s 2nd witness statement.
    To be fair to the Post Office, its origin was the witness statements served by
    Fujitsu employees, rather than Post Office employees. The position within the
    Fujitsu witness evidence, prior to its correction by the later statements from
    Mr Parker, was that what Mr Roll said was possible on Legacy Horizon, and what
    he had himself done, was simply not possible. Indeed, Dr Worden considered it
    sufficiently clear that as an IT expert he felt able confidently to assert in
    his 1st Expert Report that he, Dr Worden, had “established” that Mr Roll’s evidence
    of fact in this respect was wrong. After service of Mr Roll’s 2nd witness statement,
    Fujitsu finally came clean and confirmed (via Mr Parker) that what Mr Roll said
    was correct. Data could be altered by Fujitsu on Horizon as if at the branch;
    under Legacy Horizon, transactions could be inserted at the counter in the way
    Mr Roll described. This could be done without the SPM knowing about this. Mr Godeseth
    also confirmed that it would appear as though the SPM themselves had performed
    the transaction. This is directly contrary to what the Post Office had been saying
    publicly for many years.

    Parker 先生的声明更正之前，富士通的证人证据中的立场是 Roll 先生说的在传统 Horizon 上是可能的，而他自己所做的事情是根本不可能的。事实上，Worden
    博士认为，作为一名 IT 专家，他可以有信心地断言他在第一份专家报告中已经“确认”了 Roll 先生在这方面的事实证据是错误的。在 Roll 先生的第二份证人声明发出后，富士通终于坦诚并确认（通过
    Parker 先生），Roll 先生所说的是正确的。数据可以被富士通在 Horizon 上像在分支机构一样更改；在传统 Horizon 下，交易可以像 Roll
    先生描述的那样在柜台插入。这可以在 SPM 不知情的情况下完成。Godeseth 先生还确认，看起来好像是 SPM 们自己执行了交易。这与总邮政局多年来公开发表的说法完全相反。

    年 10 月 Lepton 发生的事情。这导致了在整个审判过程中被称为 Helen Rose 报告或 Rose 报告的事情，因为报告的作者被称为 Helen
    Rose。我在上文 [227] 中对此进行了一定程度的处理。该报告记录了以下内容：“2012 年 10 月 4 日 10:42 在 Lepton SPSO
    191320 发生了一笔英国电信账单支付交易，金额为 £76.09；这笔款项由 Lloyds TSB 提款 £80.00 支付，找零为 £3.91。在同一天的
    10:37，英国电信账单支付被撤销为现金结算。
- en: The branch was issued with a Transaction Correction for £76.09, which they duly
    settled; however the postmaster denied reversing this transaction and involved
    a Forensic Accountant as he believed his reputation was in doubt.” (“duly settled”
    means the SPM paid the Post Office that sum). The Credence data showed that the
    SPM had reversed the transaction. By consulting the audit data, Mr Jenkins discovered
    that he had not. This was expressly confirmed, both in the Rose Report and also
    by Ms Van Den Bogerd in her cross-examination.

- en: This shows that prior to this change to the script (which cannot have taken
    place prior to the date it was implemented, for obvious reasons) all the SSC users
    had the very powerful permission (also sometimes called privileges) of the APPSUP
    user. The experts were agreed that such users could, in terms, do whatever they
    wanted in terms of access to the system. That could obviously have an impact on
    branch accounts, depending upon what was done by any particular user on any particular
    occasion. SSC users should only have had the far more limited SSC role and Fujitsu
    itself were aware of this, and can only be the entity responsible for them having
    the incorrect wider role, as they were all Fujitsu employees. The section of the
    accompanying judgment of Mr Godeseth in the judgment that accompanies this also
    refers to evidence from My Coyne and Mr Parker on the same subject. Mr Parker
    challenged Mr Coyne’s figure but had no basis for doing so, as all he had was
    his impression, and he had specifically failed to do a proper investigation even
    though I find Fujitsu could have provided far more proper, cogent evidence of
    the number of occasions. I accept Mr Coyne’s evidence on this, and given both
    Dr Worden and Mr Godeseth accepted that the powerful APPSUP permission or privileges
    were more widely available, and less controlled, than they ought to have been
    (even based on Fujitsu’s own internal controls) then this inevitably has a detrimental
    effect upon the robustness of Horizon.

  zh: 这表明在脚本更改之前（由于明显的原因，脚本更改不可能在实施日期之前发生），所有的 SSC 用户都拥有非常强大的权限（有时也称为特权）APP SUP 用户。专家们一致认为，这些用户实际上可以在系统访问方面随心所欲。这显然可能会对分支账户产生影响，具体取决于任何特定用户在任何特定场合所做的事情。SSC
    用户应该只拥有更为有限的 SSC 角色，而富士通自身也意识到了这一点，只能将错误的更广泛角色归因于富士通本身，因为他们都是富士通的雇员。陪审员戈德塞斯在陪审中所附的判决中的这一部分还提到了科因和帕克先生就同一问题提供的证据。帕克先生对科因先生的数字提出了质疑，但没有任何依据，因为他只有自己的印象，而且他明确未能进行适当的调查，即使我发现富士通可以提供更多关于发生次数的适当、有力的证据。我接受科因先生的证词，鉴于沃登博士和戈德塞斯先生都承认强大的
    APP SUP 权限或特权比他们应该拥有的更广泛，并且受到的控制也更少（即使基于富士通自己的内部控制），这不可避免地会对 Horizon 的稳健性产生不利影响。

- en: The Post Office trial is one of the few cases where an in-depth examination
    of system failures is made public and so it’s a valuable lesson to learn from.
    Even simple problems like maintaining a stock balance become complex when part
    of a distributed system. Techniques like ACID transactions can reduce the likelihood
    of errors but real implementations will sometimes fail. When a system processes
    a large number of transactions, this small probability of failure can add up to
    frequent errors. I hope that the presumption that computers operate correctly
    is revisited, and the factors revealed by the Post Office trial are taken into
    account when doing so.

  zh: 邮政审判是少数公开进行系统故障深入检查的案例之一，因此它是一个值得学习的宝贵教训。即使是像维护库存余额这样的简单问题，在分布式系统的一部分时也变得复杂。像
    ACID 事务这样的技术可以降低错误的可能性，但真实的实现有时会失败。当系统处理大量交易时，这种失败的概率虽然很小，但会导致频繁的错误。我希望人们重新考虑计算机正确运行的假设，并且在这样做时考虑到邮政审判揭示的因素。
