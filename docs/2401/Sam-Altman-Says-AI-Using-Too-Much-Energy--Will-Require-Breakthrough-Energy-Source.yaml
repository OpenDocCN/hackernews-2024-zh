    [astronomical amount of electricity](https://futurism.com/the-byte/ai-electricity-use-spiking-power-entire-country).

    that the industry could soon suck up as much electricity as an entire country.

- en: So it shouldn't come as a surprise that OpenAI CEO Sam Altman is looking for
    cheaper alternatives. During a *Bloomberg* event at the annual World Economic
    Forum in Davos, Switzerland, the billionaire suggested that the AI models of tomorrow
    may require even *more* power — to the degree that they'll need a whole new power
    *source*.

    as [quoted by *Reuters*](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/openai-ceo-altman-says-davos-173636736.html).
    "It motivates us to go invest more in fusion," adding that we need better ways
    to store energy from solar power.'

    today. Fusion energy has long been seen as the holy grail, representing a hypothetically
    limitless source of energy without the risks associated with nuclear fission.

    a way to fuse atoms in a way that produces a net positive amount of energy at
    scale.

    in a nuclear fusion company called Helion Energy back in 2021\. Conveniently,
    the company has since [signed a partnership](https://www.helionenergy.com/articles/helion-announces-worlds-first-fusion-ppa-with-microsoft/)
    with Microsoft, the tech giant that invested [$13 billion in OpenAI](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/04/08/microsofts-complex-bet-on-openai-brings-potential-and-uncertainty.html). Altman
    [has also suggested](https://futurism.com/sam-altman-agi-fusion-world) that AI
    itself could crack the case on how to make fusion a practical energy tech.

    [claimed](https://futurism.com/the-byte/fusion-power-imminent) that fusion energy
    is right around the corner, we have yet to see any concrete results.

    turn into a reality, we'd have a considerably greener way to power these AI models.

    sources of energy that already exist.

    now. The carbon footprint of the AI industry is really starting to rear its ugly
    head. According to an [October paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2542435123003653?dgcid=author)
    published in the journal *Joule*, adding generative AI to Google Search alone
    balloons its energy uses by more than tenfold.
