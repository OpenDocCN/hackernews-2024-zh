She said any specific guidance she received on Northern Irish law and procedure came mainly from the "police and Crown Prosecution Service".

The inquiry also heard that as an investigator, Ms Winter was set a target of 65% for the recovery of monies from those who were under investigation.

"That 65% rate was for fraud loss recovery, the senior team in the security were always about trying to get as much money back as they possibly could," Ms Winter said.

She also agreed with a lawyer representing the inquiry that there had been a lower target rate for fraud recovery in previous years.

"Yes I do believe there was and it was maybe the last three, four years, there was more pressure put on everyone by the senior team to increase this figure."

More than 900 sub-postmasters and postmistresses were prosecuted for stealing money because of incorrect information provided by a computer system called Horizon.

The Post Office itself brought many of the cases to court and, between 1999 and 2015, it prosecuted 736 people - an average of one person a week.

Another 283 cases were brought by other bodies, including the Crown Prosecution Service.

Many maintained their innocence and said they had repeatedly reported problems with the software.

Some of those convicted went to prison for false accounting and theft and many were financially ruined.

The inquiry continues.
