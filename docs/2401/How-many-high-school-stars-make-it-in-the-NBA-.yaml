    they pan out?

    school recruit in 2000—something that you think would indicate future NBA stardom—he
    put together a meager career in the league, averaging around 5 points per game
    over 5 years. On the flip side is LeBron James—the #1 high school recruit just
    a few years later—and we all know what he’s been up to.'

    school. Now that we’ve entered the YouTube era, hype surrounding players can inflate
    in an instant. Sure, LeBron paved the way with some nationally televised games,
    but now millions of people are watching Zion Williamson throw down dunks in warm
    ups, or Lamelo Ball hit threes from half court in eight grade.

    in the US according to the Recruiting Services Consensus Index.

- en: 27% of the 1,563 top-ranked high school players made it to the NBA and only
    25% made it past their two-year rookie contract. Put another way, 441 of the 900
    draft picks in that 15 year span were top 100 recruits. Just 31 players eventually
    reached “superstar” status (based on advanced statistics, details at the bottom).

    players will make it to the NBA more often, right?

    full 84% of them eventually made it to the NBA. Though with 60 draft picks a year,
    you might expect that number to be higher.

    future success that they could draft them straight out of high school. This ended
    in 2006 when a [rule](https://web.archive.org/web/20080227065646/http://www.nbpa.com/cba_articles/article-X.php)
    was [put into place](https://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/28/sports/basketball/nba-draft-will-close-book-on-high-school-stars.html),
    declaring that players had to be at least 19 years old or one year removed from
    high school before getting drafted. But talks are escalating about [reversing
    this rule](http://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/26049542/nba-proposes-changing-draft-age-19-18-players-union),
    especially in light of the [“shoe incident”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqJUgQAyDMo).
    Let’s look at the success of the straight-to-NBA high school players.

    ultimately fizzled out of the NBA having played only [15 minutes](http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/y/youngko01.html)
    across 3 games. However, he appears to be the exception more than the rule. Of
    the other 34 players drafted straight out of high school, 94% made it past their
    rookie contract, with 55% eventually becoming mediocre or better NBA players.'

    to those that played in a US high school, but did not appear on the top 100 list.
    We found 338 of these players that were eventually drafted into the NBA, despite
    being undervalued in high school. Let’s compare their career paths with our highly-ranked
    and drafted high schoolers.

    drafted, the success rate of players ranked in high school is notably higher than
    for those who weren’t. Where 92% of the drafted and ranked players made it past
    their rookie contract, only 73% of the unranked and drafted players stayed more
    than two years. Seven players—Dwyane Wade, Marc Gasol, Paul George, Jimmy Butler,Russell
    Westbrook, Stephen Curry, and Damian Lillard—whose high school careers were apparently
    not worthy of a spot amongst the top 100, still broke into the ranks of superstars
    in their NBA careers.

    Kansas, Duke, and UNC are known to consistently land the biggest recruits. Do
    these recruits translate into NBA success stories or is college their last stop?
