# A New Home for Meetup - Meetup Blog

> 来源：[https://www.meetup.com/blog/a-new-home-for-meetup/](https://www.meetup.com/blog/a-new-home-for-meetup/)

Hi everyone,

I’m Luca Ferrari, a co-founder and the CEO of Bending Spoons—a technology company that owns and develops a suite of category-leading consumer products including Remini (an AI-powered photo enhancer), Splice (a mobile video editor), and Evernote (a personal productivity app). 

Meetup is a community-based product, so it’s fitting that I share the news with the Meetup community personally: on Friday, January 5, Bending Spoons entered into an agreement to become the new owner of Meetup, subject to closing conditions. The acquisition is expected to close later in January.

Meetup has a powerful global brand, a large, vibrant user base, and a mission that resonates strongly. Quite simply, Meetup is a force for good in the world, and it’s a pleasure and a privilege to become the new steward. We’re eager to support Meetup’s future success by drawing from the expertise we’ve developed in a decade of building high-performing digital technology products.

Once we officially take the reins you’ll hear more from us, including about future plans. In the meantime, I want to congratulate the Meetup team on building such a wonderful, beloved product. And I want to thank you, the organizers and members, for embracing Meetup and its mission so enthusiastically. We can’t wait to get to work on this exciting project!

See you later in January,

—Luca.
