    the agency expected it to [resolve quickly](https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/17/health/adderall-shortage-impact/index.html).
    But five months in, the effects of the shortage are still making life tough for
    people with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder who rely on the drug. Stories
    abound of frustrated people going to dozens of pharmacies in search of medication
    each month, [only to come up short](https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/11f6ifb/i_cant_keep_doing_this_every_month_with_the/)

    [and maintain relationships](https://www.self.com/story/adderall-shortage-adhd-consequences).
    The Adderall shortage has ended, but the widely used generic versions of the drug,
    known as amphetamine mixed salts, are still scarce.

    to blame for the shortage, David Goodman, an ADHD expert and a psychiatry professor
    at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, told me. And they have all
    been compounded by the fact that the pandemic produced a surge in Americans who
    want Adderall. The most dramatic changes occurred among adults, according to a
    recent CDC [report](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/72/wr/mm7213a1.htm?s_cid=mm7213a1_w)
    on stimulant prescriptions, with increases in some age groups of more than 10
    percent in just a single year, from 2020 to 2021\. It’s the nature of the spike
    in demand for Adderall—among *adults*—that has some ADHD experts worried about
    “whether the demand is legitimate,” Goodman said. It’s possible that at least
    some of these new Adderall patients, he said, are getting prescriptions they do
    not need.

    should diagnose and treat adults with ADHD—a gap the CDC has [called](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/72/wr/mm7213a1.htm?s_cid=mm7213a1_w)
    a “public health concern.” When people come in wanting help for ADHD, providers
    have “a lot of choices about what to use and when to use it, and those parameters
    have implications for good care or bad care,” Craig Surman, a psychiatry professor
    and an ADHD expert at Harvard and the scientific coordinator of adult-ADHD research
    at Massachusetts General Hospital, told me. The stimulant shortage will end, but
    even then, adults with ADHD may not get the care they need.

    symptoms related to ADHD—such as difficulty focusing, inability to sit still,
    and fidgeting—have largely been associated with children and teenagers. Doctors
    widely assumed that kids would grow out of it eventually. Although symptoms become
    “evident at a very early period of life,” one Scottish physician wrote in 1798,
    “what is very fortunate [is that] it is generally diminished with age.” For some
    people, ADHD symptoms really do get better as they enter adulthood, but for most,
    [symptoms continue](https://chadd.org/attention-article/how-adhd-sometimes-improves/).
    The focus on children persists today in part because of parental pressure. Pediatricians
    have had to build a child-focused ADHD model, Surman said, because parents come
    in and say, “What are we going to do with our kid?” As a result, treating children
    ages 4 to 18 for ADHD is relatively straightforward: [Clear-cut clinical guidelines](https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article/144/4/e20192528/81590/Clinical-Practice-Guideline-for-the-Diagnosis?autologincheck=redirected)
    from the American Academy of Pediatrics specify the need for rigorous psychiatric
    testing that rules out other causes and includes reports about the patient from
    parents and teachers. Treatment usually involves behavior management and, if necessary,
    medication.'

    in other developed nations, including the U.K. and Canada. In fact, the disorder
    was only recently acknowledged within the field of adult psychiatry. One reason
    it went overlooked for so long is because ADHD can sometimes look different in
    kids compared with adults: Physical hyperactivity tends to decrease with age as
    opposed to, say, emotional or organizational problems. “The recognition that ADHD
    is a life-span disorder that persists into adulthood in most people has really
    only happened in the last 20 years,” Margaret Sibley, a psychiatry professor at
    the University of Washington School of Medicine, told me. And the field of adult
    psychiatry has been slow to catch up. Adult ADHD was directly addressed for the
    first time in *DSM-5*—the American Psychiatric Association’s diagnostic bible—in
    [2013](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3955126/), but the criteria
    described there still haven’t been translated into practical instructions for
    clinicians.'

    grown-ups. A key distinction is that the disorder impairs different aspects of
    an adult’s life: Whereas a pediatrician would investigate ADHD’s impact at school
    or at home, a provider evaluating an adult might delve into its effects at work
    or in romantic relationships. Sources of information differ too: Parents and teachers
    can shed light on a child’s situation, but “you wouldn’t call the parent of a
    40-year-old to get their take on whether the person has ADHD,” Sibley said. Providers
    usually rely instead on self-reporting—which isn’t always accurate. Complicating
    matters, the symptoms of ADHD tend to be masked by other cognitive issues that
    arise in adulthood, such as those caused by depression, drug use, thyroid problems,
    or hormonal shifts, Sibley said: “It’s a tough disorder to diagnose, because there’s
    no objective test.” The best option is to perform a lengthy psychiatric evaluation,
    which usually involves reviewing symptoms, performing a medical exam, taking the
    patient’s history, and assessing the patient using rating scales or checklists,
    [according to the APA](https://www.psychiatry.org/patients-families/adhd/what-is-adhd).'

    is no pressure to uphold that standard. Virtual forms of ADHD care that proliferated
    during the pandemic, for example, were rarely conducive to lengthy evaluations.
    A major telehealth platform that dispensed ADHD prescriptions, Cerebral, has been
    [investigated](https://www.additudemag.com/cerebral-adhd-telehealth-diagnosis-medication-report/)
    for sacrificing medical rigor for speedy treatment and customer satisfaction,
    potentially letting people without ADHD get Adderall for recreational use. In
    one survey, [97 percent](https://www.additudemag.com/cerebral-adhd-telehealth-diagnosis-medication-report/)
    of Cerebral users said they’d received a prescription of some kind. Initial consultations
    with providers lasted just [half an hour](https://www.wsj.com/articles/startups-make-it-easier-to-get-adhd-drugs-that-made-some-workers-anxious-11648267205?mod=article_inline),

    “It’s impossible to do a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation in 30 minutes,”
    Goodman said. (Cerebral previously denied wrongdoing and no longer prescribes
    Adderall or other stimulants.)

    in the first place. Because adult ADHD was only recently recognized, most psychiatrists
    working today received no formal training in treating the disorder. “There’s a
    shortage of expertise,” Surman said. “It’s a confusing space where, at this point,
    consumers often are educating providers.” The dearth of trained professionals
    means that many adults seeking help for ADHD are seen by providers, including
    primary-care doctors, social workers, and nurse practitioners, who lack the experience
    to offer it. “It’s a systemic issue,” Sibley said, “not that they’re being negligent.”

    dangerous care. Adderall is just one of many stimulants used to treat ADHD, and
    choosing the right one for a patient can be challenging—and not all people with
    ADHD need or want to take them. But even the most well-intentioned health-care
    professionals may be unprepared to evaluate patients properly. The federal government
    considers Adderall a highly addictive Schedule II drug, like oxycodone and fentanyl,
    and the risks of prescribing it unnecessarily are high: Apart from dependency,
    it can also cause issues such as heart problems, mood changes, anxiety, and depression.
    Some people with ADHD might be better off with [behavioral therapy](https://www.additudemag.com/non-stimulant-adhd-medication/)
    [or drugs](https://www.additudemag.com/non-stimulant-adhd-medication/) that aren’t
    stimulants. Unfortunately, it can be all too easy for inexperienced providers
    to start a patient on these drugs and continue treatment. “If I give stimulants
    to the average person, they’ll say their mood, their thinking, and their energy
    are better,” Goodman said. “It’s very important not to make a diagnosis based
    on the response to stimulant medication.” But the uptick in adults receiving prescriptions
    for those drugs [since at least 2016](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/72/wr/mm7213a1.htm?s_cid=mm7213a1_w)

    American Professional Society of ADHD and Related Disorders [began drafting](https://apsard.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/APSARD-Adult-ADHD-Guidelines-Press-Release.pdf)
    the long-needed guidelines. The organization’s goal is to standardize care and
    treatment for adult ADHD across the country, said Goodman, who is APSARD’s treasurer.
    Establishing standards could have “broad, sweeping implications” beyond patient
    care, he added: Their existence could compel more medical schools to teach about
    adult ADHD, persuade insurance companies to cover treatment, and pressure lawmakers
    to include it in workplace policies.'

    percent](https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/adhd/data.html) of children). “You have a
    much larger market of recognized and untreated adults, and that will continue
    to increase,” Goodman said. Women—who, [like girls](https://chadd.org/adhd-news/adhd-news-adults/how-the-gender-gap-leaves-girls-and-women-undertreated-for-adhd/),
    are [historically underdiagnosed](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/10870547231164155)—will

    destigmatization, will continue to boost the ranks of people who want help. On
