    on stimulant prescriptions, with increases in some age groups of more than 10
    percent in just a single year, from 2020 to 2021\. It’s the nature of the spike
    in demand for Adderall—among *adults*—that has some ADHD experts worried about

    have implications for good care or bad care,” Craig Surman, a psychiatry professor
    and an ADHD expert at Harvard and the scientific coordinator of adult-ADHD research

    symptoms related to ADHD—such as difficulty focusing, inability to sit still,

    widely assumed that kids would grow out of it eventually. Although symptoms become
    “evident at a very early period of life,” one Scottish physician wrote in 1798,

    people, ADHD symptoms really do get better as they enter adulthood, but for most,
    [symptoms continue](https://chadd.org/attention-article/how-adhd-sometimes-improves/).
    The focus on children persists today in part because of parental pressure. Pediatricians
    have had to build a child-focused ADHD model, Surman said, because parents come
    in and say, “What are we going to do with our kid?” As a result, treating children
    ages 4 to 18 for ADHD is relatively straightforward: [Clear-cut clinical guidelines](https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article/144/4/e20192528/81590/Clinical-Practice-Guideline-for-the-Diagnosis?autologincheck=redirected)

    opposed to, say, emotional or organizational problems. “The recognition that ADHD
    is a life-span disorder that persists into adulthood in most people has really

    “认识到ADHD是一种跨越整个生命阶段的障碍，在大多数人身上在成年期仍然存在，这实际上是在过去的20年里才发生的，” 华盛顿大学医学院的精神病学教授Margaret
    Sibley告诉我。而成人精神病学领域的发展却很缓慢。成人ADHD在*DSM-5*——美国精神病学会的诊断圣经——中首次得到直接处理，[2013年](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3955126/)，但那里描述的标准仍然没有被转化为临床医生的实用指南。
- en: 'Addressing adult ADHD isn’t as simple as adapting children’s standards for
    grown-ups. A key distinction is that the disorder impairs different aspects of
    an adult’s life: Whereas a pediatrician would investigate ADHD’s impact at school
    or at home, a provider evaluating an adult might delve into its effects at work
    or in romantic relationships. Sources of information differ too: Parents and teachers
    can shed light on a child’s situation, but “you wouldn’t call the parent of a
    40-year-old to get their take on whether the person has ADHD,” Sibley said. Providers
    usually rely instead on self-reporting—which isn’t always accurate. Complicating
    matters, the symptoms of ADHD tend to be masked by other cognitive issues that
    arise in adulthood, such as those caused by depression, drug use, thyroid problems,
    or hormonal shifts, Sibley said: “It’s a tough disorder to diagnose, because there’s
    no objective test.” The best option is to perform a lengthy psychiatric evaluation,
    which usually involves reviewing symptoms, performing a medical exam, taking the
    patient’s history, and assessing the patient using rating scales or checklists,

    dangerous care. Adderall is just one of many stimulants used to treat ADHD, and
    choosing the right one for a patient can be challenging—and not all people with
    ADHD need or want to take them. But even the most well-intentioned health-care
    professionals may be unprepared to evaluate patients properly. The federal government
    considers Adderall a highly addictive Schedule II drug, like oxycodone and fentanyl,
    and the risks of prescribing it unnecessarily are high: Apart from dependency,
    it can also cause issues such as heart problems, mood changes, anxiety, and depression.
