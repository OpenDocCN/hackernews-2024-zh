- en: The Duplex watch escapement shown in the images below was invented by Robert
    Hooke circa 1700, then later improved by Jean Baptiste Dutertre and Pierre Le
    Roy, before being perfected by Thomas Tyrer, who patented it in 1782\. The Duplex
    escapement was difficult to make but achieved higher accuracy than the Cylinder
    escapement, which was also a 'Frictional-rest' escapement. This meant there was
    additional friction compared to the lever escapements that would end up dominating
    future movements. It was used in English pocketwatches as the one shown here,
    between 1790 to 1860.
