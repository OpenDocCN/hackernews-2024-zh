- en: After around 30 years of existence, WordPad is finally saying goodbye. In the
    Windows 11 Build 26020 Insider Preview’s [Canary Channel](https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2024/01/03/announcing-windows-11-insider-preview-build-26020-canary-channel/),
    Microsoft announced that WordPad will not be auto-installed after installing the
    new OS build and will officially be removed in the future update. It clarified
    that the text editor won’t be available for reinstallation. This really is goodbye,
    then.

    was introduced in Windows 95 and is the successor to the OG Microsoft Write. WordPad
    was initially positioned in two ways: 1) a text editor that has some functionalities
    of MS Word and 2) a more advanced version of the Notepad text editor, which was
    released some 40 years ago in 1983.'

    on all the Deprecated features for Windows clients, the company says, “We recommend
    Microsoft Word for rich text documents like .doc and .rtf and Windows Notepad
    for plain text documents like .txt.” This somewhat hints at the fact that Microsoft,
    too, realized that WordPad is just a weird middle ground between MS Word and Notepad
    and can be done away with. This is mainly conjecture, though, and there’s a possibility
    the company had other, more solid reasons for removing the text editor.

    also points out that they recently noticed that WordPad didn’t get a dark mode
    update and that it should have been enough to give them an idea of its upcoming
    demise. It makes sense when they compare it to Notepad’s recent dark mode update
    and mention an upcoming update with autosave functionality that it will get soon.'

    mostly because the bulk of its functionalities (mainly managing contacts) are
    being moved to Outlook for Windows.

    and a half times in my life, and that too, when I had my reasons for not using
    MS Word or Google Docs, I can imagine others, like some of my colleagues feeling
    a bit more nostalgic for the word-processing app when it’s gone. WordPad did feel
    like one of those things that would be around forever, and I don’t know how I
    feel about that.
