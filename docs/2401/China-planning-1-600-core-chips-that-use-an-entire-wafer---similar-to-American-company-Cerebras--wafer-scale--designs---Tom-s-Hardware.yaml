    of Sciences introduced an advanced 256-core multi-chiplet and have plans to scale
    the design up to 1,600-core chips that employ an entire wafer as one compute device.

- en: It is getting harder and harder to increase transistor density with every new
    generation of chips, so chipmakers are looking for other ways to increase performance
    of their processors, which includes architectural innovations, larger die sizes,
    multi-chiplet designs, and even wafer-scale chips. The latter has only been [managed
    by Cerebras](https://www.tomshardware.com/news/cerebras-wafer-scale-engine-2-worlds-largest-chip-7nm-850000-cores)
    so far, but it looks like Chinese developers are looking towards them as well.
    Apparently, they have already built a 256-core multi-chiplet design and are exploring
    ways to go wafer-scale, using an entire wafer to build one large chip.

- en: Scientists from the Institute of Computing Technology at the Chinese Ac ademy
    of Sciences introduced an advanced 256-core multi-chiplet compute complex called
    Zhejiang Big Chip in a recent publication in the journal [*Fundamental Research*](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2667325823003709),
    as reported by [The Next Platform](https://www.nextplatform.com/2024/01/03/with-big-chip-china-lays-out-aspirations-for-waferscale/).
    The multi-chiplet design consists of 16 chiplets containing 16 RISC-V cores each
    and connected to each other in a conventional symmetric multiprocessor (SMP) manner
    using a network-on-chip so that the chiplets could share memory. Each chiplet
    has multiple die-to-die interfaces to connect to neighbor chiplets over a 2.5D
    interposer and the CAS researchers say that the design is scalable to 100 chiplets,
    or to 1,600 cores.

    by Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp. (SMIC). We are not sure how
    much power a 1,600-core assembly interconnected using an interposer and made on
    a 22nm production node would consume. As The Next Platform points out, nothing
    stops CAS from producing a 1,600-core wafer-scale chip, which would greatly optimize
    power consumption and performance due to reduced latencies.

    the potential of this new architecture for future computing needs. Multi-chiplet
    designs could be used to build processors for exascale supercomputers, the researchers
    note, something that AMD and Intel do today.

    architecture as a powerful and flexible solution," the researchers wrote. “The
    hierarchical-chiplet architecture is designed as many cores and many chiplets
    with hierarchical interconnect. Inside the chiplet, cores are communicated using
    ultra-low-latency interconnect while inter-chiplet are interconnected with low
    latency beneficial from the advanced packaging technology, such that the on-chiplet
    latency and the NUMA effect in such high-scalability system can be minimized."'

    such assemblies, which could potentially introduce difficulties with programming
    of such devices.

- en: '"The memory hierarchy contains core memory [caches], on-chiplet memory and
    off-chiplet memory," the description reads. "The memory from these three levels
    vary in terms of memory bandwidth, latency, power consumption and cost. In the
    overview of hierarchical-chiplet architecture, multiple cores are connected through
    cross switch and they share a cache. This forms a pod structure and the pod is
    interconnected through the intra-chiplet network. Multiple pods form a chiplet
    and the chiplet is interconnect through the inter-chiplet network and then connects
    to the off-chip(let) memory. Careful design is needed to make full use of such
    hierarchy. Reasonably utilizing the memory bandwidth to balance the workload of
    different computing hierarchy can significantly improve the chiplet system efficiency.
    Properly designing the communication network resource can ensure the chiplet collaboratively
    performing the shared-memory task."'

    computing, near-memory computing, and 3D stacked memory. However, the paper stops
    short of providing specific details on the implementation of these technologies
    or addressing the challenges they might pose in the design and construction of
    such complex systems.

    Zhejiang Big Chip multi-chiplet compute complex. From here, the company can explore
    performance of its chiplet design and then make decisions regarding system-in-packages
    with a higher number of cores, different classes of memory, and wafer-scale integration.
