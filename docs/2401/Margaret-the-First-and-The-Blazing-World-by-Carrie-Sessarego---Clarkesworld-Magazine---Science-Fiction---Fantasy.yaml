- en: Mary Shelley’s *Frankenstein* is widely considered to be the first modern science
    fiction novel. However, centuries prior to Shelley’s work, another woman was writing
    proto-science fiction. Margaret Cavendish’s *The Blazing World* features travels
    to another “world,” one populated by beast-people who live in a utopia of natural
    beauty and social harmony. Who was this visionary woman, and how did she become
    one of the earliest writers of the nebulous genre, proto-science fiction, that
    paved the way for our modern science fiction genre?

- en: Proto-science fiction refers to work that might also be thought of as science
    fiction adjacent—it lacks the emphasis on modern science and technology that science
    fiction contains, but addresses themes of alternate worlds, visits to or from
    astronomical bodies, and utopias. In these stories, there is a thin and very blurry
    line between magic and science. These stories often also contain elements of adventure
    and romance (both in the sense of a story that includes romantic love and in the
    sense of a story that includes marvelous adventures). While there’s no strict
    definition of what is and isn’t proto-science fiction, examples often listed include
    *Utopia* by Thomas More, *Somnium* by Johannes Kepler, and *The Man in the Moone*
    by Francis Godwin.

- en: '*The Description of a New World, Called the Blazing-World* (known today as
    *The Blazing World*) is a satire and commentary on philosophy and sciences as
    they stood in England in 1666, as well as a hodgepodge of genres including war
    epic, biography, travelogue, adventure story, and treatise. Parts of the book
    are more novelistic than others, with a large section devoted to dialogue about
    the workings of the utopian society discovered by the heroine. The book has the
    science fiction element of an alien world and some advanced technology while also
    incorporating romantic adventure and fantasy. Originally, the story was included
    at the end of a nonfiction text titled *Observations upon Experimental Philosophy*,
    as a kind of fictional treat that addressed many of Cavendish’s concerns in an
    entertaining context.'

    fiction, leaving modern critics free to argue about who wrote the very first science
    fiction story. Similarly, the question of who wrote the first English-language
    novel is in dispute, with candidates ranging from *Le Morte D'Arthur* by Thomas
    Malory, published in 1485, to *Pamela, or Virtue Rewarded* by Samuel Richardson,
    published in 1740\. Needless to say, *The Blazing World*, with its long philosophical
    passages and its initial presentation as part of a longer philosophical text,
    is as much a proto-novel as it is proto-science fiction.

    (who is henceforth referred to as Lady or, later on, as Empress) is kidnapped
    by a merchant who forces her onto a boat. The boat is caught in storms that cause
    it to end up in the North Pole, where everyone but the Lady freezes to death (the
    Lady is saved by “the light of her Beauty, the heat of her Youth, and Protection
    of the Gods”). It develops that there is another world that touches our own at
    the very tip of the North Pole, and the Lady enters this new world in which she
    is conveyed to the Emperor who marries her, making her Empress.

    animals. Each type of beast-person specializes in a different field. For instance,
    bird-men are astronomers, and ape-men are chemists. The Empress gathers various
    intellectuals together and questions them about the religion, politics, and sciences
    of the Blazing World. Ultimately, she concludes that a perfect and peaceful society
    requires an absolute monarchy. Anxious to write her own “cabbala” (explanation
    of the nature of God, nature, and spirituality), she selects the Duchess of Newcastle
    (who is, of course, Margaret Cavendish herself) to be her scribe. Because physical
    beings can only cross into other worlds at the poles, the Duchess and the Empress
    commune in spirit and their spirits visit each other’s worlds. The Empress concludes
    that it is best for a world to have “one sovereign, one religion, one law, and
    one language, so that all the world might be but one united family, without divisions;
    nay, like God, and his blessed saints and angels.”

    biographers (but apparently not her contemporaries) as “Mad Madge.” Margaret Cavendish
    was a woman of contradictions. Painfully shy, she longed for fame and dressed
    in eccentric and eye-catching clothing of her own design. A woman who had an unusual
    amount of agency over her own life, she often wrote of the frailties of women,
    alternating between praising their capabilities and insisting that they be governed
    by their husbands. A devoted writer, she struggled with handwriting and spelling
    to such a degree that her biographer, Katie Whitaker, believes that she may have
    been dyslexic. A rebel in her personal life and her arts, she was a staunch Royalist
    even through rebellions and a civil war.'

    I. Two years later, James I was succeeded by his son, Charles I, a man whose reign
    would be pivotal to Margaret’s fate and that of her family. The Lucas family had
    made their money by serving the king for generations, mostly in matters of law.
    Long before Margaret was born, Margaret’s father, Thomas, was being prepared for
    a degree in law and a subsequent career at the court of Elizabeth I when he met
    a woman named Elizabeth Leighton. He killed a man in a duel and was forced to
    leave the country, leaving Elizabeth Leighton unmarried and pregnant. Six years
    later, Thomas was pardoned by Elizabeth I’s son, James I. He returned to England
    and finally married Elizabeth and met his son. This marriage, one that, unusually
    for the day, began in love, seems to have remained a happy one. Incidentally,
    Thomas’ sister, Anne, also married for love against Elizabeth I’s wishes, indicating
    that a romantic and rebellious outlook ran in the family.

    several large estates. They lived the life of wealthy gentry in Essex. Thomas
    died of a sudden illness when Margaret was two. She viewed her oldest brother,
    John, as a father figure, idealizing him despite the fact that he was a tyrant
    in the eyes of the locals due to his devotion to collecting even the most modest
    of sums from his tenants, however impoverished they may be.

    with the children. Her permissive attitude allowed Margaret to get away with dodging
    many of her lessons regarding female accomplishments (needlework, music, dancing,
    speaking French). She learned to read and write in English (but not Latin or Greek,
    languages that were usually reserved for boys). A voracious reader and writer,
    she had already written multitudes of journal entries and stories by her teens.

    their tenants and other tradespeople in the region, until the local people launched
    an uprising, raiding the Lucas manor and arresting the Lucas family. John Lucas
    was held in the Tower of London and the rest of the family spent a week in the
    Colchester jail. Upon release, the family moved to London, and Margaret was able
    to convince her mother to send her to the court of Queen Henrietta Maria, who
    was residing at Oxford at the time.

    at court as snobbery and rudeness, and she was disliked by most of her peers.
    Having begged to be allowed to go to court, she now begged her mother for permission
    to leave it, but her mother ordered her to stay. Happily for Margaret, she caught
    the eye of William Cavendish, the Marquess of Newcastle. He was a widower and
    a father who hoped to remarry in order to have more children. He was twenty years
    older than Margaret, but they fell in love and exchanged letters and poems at
    least daily. In keeping with family tradition, the couple married against the
    wishes of the Queen, although she was quicker to forgive Margaret than Elizabeth
    I had been of her parents.

    despite the best efforts of various physicians who recommended treatments that
    included herbal suppositories, bleedings, purges, and complex diets. However,
    in all else, they were great partners. Both wrote and encouraged each other to
    do so. William hosted the most prestigious philosophers and artists of the day.
    He had a household laboratory in which Margaret studied chemistry and owned microscopes
    and telescopes, both of which Margaret used. He loved talking to Margaret and
    reading to her, telling her about his experiences with war and politics. The marriage
    survived years of war, separation, and exile. Staunch royalists, they were deeply
    relieved when Charles II took power during the Stuart Restoration, and they could
    return to England after decades of exile in Paris and in the Netherlands.

    author of poetry, plays, and essays. Now in her forties, her ideas about the world
    were constantly evolving with the exception of her unwavering loyalty to the monarchy
    and to her husband. Margaret loved to design clothing, and she was known at court
    for her fanciful outfits, which used an astonishing quantity of ribbons. Her clothing
    also broke gender barriers, as she liked to combine elements of what was, at the
    time, considered fashionable for both men and women in a single outfit. On one
    occasion, she scandalized the aristocracy by attending the theater in an outfit
    that fully exposed her breasts—a trend that was sometimes followed in different
    settings, but which was considered far too risqué for a theater outing.

    much of her life, it was considered gauche for a gentleman to publish his work
    for the benefit of the public. Generally, the men who populated the court wrote
    poetry, which they handwrote and gave to friends. If they published at all, they
    did so anonymously and for an exclusive audience. For women, the idea of publishing
    work under one’s own name was even more taboo, as it violated values of modesty
    and humility. When Margaret published her first book of poetry, only nine literary
    works had been published by upper-class women in the past fifty years, and these
    women had faced tremendous censure from their peers.

    science. This, however, was incorrect. She was both fascinated and frustrated
    by the work of contemporaries such as Johannes Kepler, who used telescopes to
    study the heavens, and Robert Hooke, who used a microscope to explore the world
    of the invisibly small. Her interest in science, her writing, and her financial
    support led to her becoming the first woman to attend a meeting of the Royal Society
    of London. In a time when science and philosophy were not distinctly different
    fields, she often expressed frustration with the abstract quality of much scientific
    study. In *The Blazing World*, the Empress speaks to logicians and philosophers,
    religious figures and scientists, and urges them all to focus their energies on
    what we would today call applied science. As fascinating as the Moon may be, Margaret
    found the obsession with distant astronomical bodies and invisible minutiae to
    be a distraction from work that would directly benefit humankind.

    new planet but a kind of multiverse, as well as a number of fictional inventions

    and the exploration of how the world functions, the story involves a boat powered
    by an engine and a submarine. It also includes a fiery substance that works somewhat
    like napalm—the flaming substance sticks to surfaces and cannot be put out with
    water. More importantly, Margaret addressed themes and images that directly or
    indirectly influenced later authors. The theme of polar travel, and its depiction
    as an icy, lonely place in which astonishing events may occur, would arise centuries
    later in *Frankenstein* by Mary Shelley and *At the Mountains of Madness* by H.
    P. Lovecraft. The hybrid people (Bear-men, Bird-men, and Worm-men) live again

    ruled by strong women whose husbands respect their intellect and accomplishments.
    She attached *The Blazing World* to her larger nonfiction book *Observations upon
    Experimental Philosophy* in hopes that female readers would find it accessible
    and entertaining, and she encourages her readers to create their own worlds using
    their imaginations. The story is also one that plays with themes of gender roles
    and with different kinds of affection, presenting the Duchess and the Empress
    as true soulmates, “*Platonick* Lovers although they were both Femals.” Furthermore,
    in *The Blazing World*, as in all of her work, Margaret championed writing as
    a worthy and virtuous pastime for women.
