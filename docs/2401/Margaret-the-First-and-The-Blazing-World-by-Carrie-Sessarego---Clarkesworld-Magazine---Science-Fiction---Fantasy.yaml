- en: Mary Shelley’s *Frankenstein* is widely considered to be the first modern science
    fiction novel. However, centuries prior to Shelley’s work, another woman was writing
    proto-science fiction. Margaret Cavendish’s *The Blazing World* features travels
    to another “world,” one populated by beast-people who live in a utopia of natural
    beauty and social harmony. Who was this visionary woman, and how did she become
    one of the earliest writers of the nebulous genre, proto-science fiction, that
    paved the way for our modern science fiction genre?

    fiction adjacent—it lacks the emphasis on modern science and technology that science
    fiction contains, but addresses themes of alternate worlds, visits to or from
    astronomical bodies, and utopias. In these stories, there is a thin and very blurry
    line between magic and science. These stories often also contain elements of adventure
    and romance (both in the sense of a story that includes romantic love and in the
    sense of a story that includes marvelous adventures). While there’s no strict
    definition of what is and isn’t proto-science fiction, examples often listed include

    would be pivotal to Margaret’s fate and that of her family. The Lucas family had
    made their money by serving the king for generations, mostly in matters of law.
    Long before Margaret was born, Margaret’s father, Thomas, was being prepared for
    a degree in law and a subsequent career at the court of Elizabeth I when he met
    a woman named Elizabeth Leighton. He killed a man in a duel and was forced to
    leave the country, leaving Elizabeth Leighton unmarried and pregnant. Six years
    later, Thomas was pardoned by Elizabeth I’s son, James I. He returned to England
    and finally married Elizabeth and met his son. This marriage, one that, unusually
    for the day, began in love, seems to have remained a happy one. Incidentally,
    Thomas’ sister, Anne, also married for love against Elizabeth I’s wishes, indicating

    study. In *The Blazing World*, the Empress speaks to logicians and philosophers,
    religious figures and scientists, and urges them all to focus their energies on

  zh: '然而，最近玛格丽特在评论家和传记作者中获得了新的赞赏，特别是与 *The Blazing World* 有关。凯蒂·惠特克（Katie Whitaker）是传记
    *Mad Madge: The Extraordinary Life of Margaret Cavendish, Duchess of Newcastle,
    the First Woman to Live by Her Pen* 的作者，她对玛格丽特进行了富有同情心的描绘，强调了她的社交焦虑、广阔的创造力、野心、好奇心和对所爱之人的忠诚。'
- en: Meanwhile, modern feminist critics find *The Blazing World* to be a groundbreaking
    novel. Not all of Margaret’s work can be considered feminist. Indeed, much of
    it is deeply regressive. However, in *The Blazing World* we are given a world
    ruled by strong women whose husbands respect their intellect and accomplishments.
    She attached *The Blazing World* to her larger nonfiction book *Observations upon
    Experimental Philosophy* in hopes that female readers would find it accessible
    and entertaining, and she encourages her readers to create their own worlds using
    their imaginations. The story is also one that plays with themes of gender roles
    and with different kinds of affection, presenting the Duchess and the Empress
    as true soulmates, “*Platonick* Lovers although they were both Femals.” Furthermore,
    in *The Blazing World*, as in all of her work, Margaret championed writing as
    a worthy and virtuous pastime for women.

  zh: 同时，现代女权主义评论家发现 *The Blazing World* 是一部开创性的小说。玛格丽特的作品并非全部都可以被视为女权主义作品。事实上，其中大部分都是深具倒退性质的。然而，在
    *The Blazing World* 中，我们看到一个由强大女性统治的世界，她们的丈夫尊重她们的智慧和成就。她将 *The Blazing World*
    附加到她更大的非虚构作品 *Observations upon Experimental Philosophy* 中，希望女性读者能够轻松愉快地阅读，并鼓励她的读者使用想象力创造自己的世界。这个故事还涉及到性别角色和不同类型的情感主题，并将公爵夫人和女皇描绘为真正的灵魂伴侣，“*柏拉图式*
    情人，尽管她们都是女性。”此外，在 *The Blazing World* 中，与她所有的作品一样，玛格丽特将写作视为女性值得拥有和崇高的消遣。
- en: Margaret longed to leave a legacy of her own, and she was successful in this.
    Centuries after her death, we are still discussing her life and her work, dissecting
    her many personal and professional flaws, but also appreciating her achievements
    and her refusal to keep those achievements hidden. By publishing widely and openly,
    Margaret not only influenced her readers but also future female authors, wedging
    the publishing door open for them considerably wider than it was when she began
    to publish. In *The Blazing World* specifically, she explored ideas and imagery
    that shaped the world of science fiction for centuries to come. *The Blazing World*,
    as a proto novel of proto-science fiction, helped to light the path that we walk
    upon today.

  zh: 玛格丽特渴望留下自己的遗产，她在这方面取得了成功。在她去世几个世纪之后，我们仍在讨论她的生活和作品，剖析她众多的个人和职业缺点，但也欣赏她的成就以及她拒绝隐藏这些成就的决心。通过广泛和公开地出版，玛格丽特不仅影响了她的读者，还影响了未来的女性作者，使她们的出版道路比她开始出版时更为广阔。在
    *The Blazing World* 中，她具体探讨了塑造未来几个世纪科幻世界的想法和形象。*The Blazing World* 作为一部原始科幻小说的原型，帮助点亮了我们今天行走的道路。
