- en: On Sunday night Samsung held its annual First Look event at [CES 2024](https://www.engadget.com/ces-2024-live-coverage-from-ces-unveiled-000021968.html),
    where the company teased the world's first transparent MicroLED display. While
    there's still no word on how much it costs or when this tech will find its way
    into retail devices, Samsung showcased its transparent MicroLED display side-by-side
    next to transparent OLED and transparent LCD models to really highlight the differences
    between the tech. Compared to the others, not only was the MicroLED panel significantly
    brighter, it also featured a completely frameless design and a more transparent
    glass panel that made it easier to see objects behind it.

- en: 'In person, the effect Samsung''s transparent micro OLED displays have is hard
    to describe, as content almost looks like a hologram as it floats in mid-air.
    The demo unit was freestanding and measured only about a centimeter thick, which
    adds even more to the illusion of a floating screen. Additionally, because of
    micro LEDs high pixel density, images also looked incredibly sharp. So far Samsung
    has only uploaded a single vertical video overflowing with EDM, but hopefully
    it gives you some idea what we saw:'

    higher brightness compared to transparent OLED panels, they are also less impacted
    by ambient light.

- en: The bad news is that with Samsung's current crop of non-transparent MicroLED
    TVs currently costing [$150,000 for a 110-inch model,](https://www.samsung.com/us/televisions-home-theater/tvs/micro-led/110-class-micro-led-samsung-4k-with-smart-hub-mna110ms1acxza/)
    it's going to be a decently long time until these new displays become anything
    close to affordable.

- en: Coincidentally, Samsung isn't the only Korean company showing off a big transparent
    display at CES this year. Its eternal rival [LG debuted the OLED T,](https://www.engadget.com/lg-brought-the-worlds-first-wireless-transparent-oled-tv-to-ces-2024-071151174.html)
    which, unlike Samsung's model, is actually going on sale this year. The OLED T
    is apparently the first wireless transparent OLED TV, with 4K resolution and LG's
    wireless transmission tech for audio and video. That's building on the company's
    (non-transparent) M3 model, which [debuted at least year's CES](https://www.engadget.com/lg-signature-m3-oled-tv-zero-connect-160030192.html).
    The OLED T also features a contrast screen that rolls down into a box at its base
    that you can raise or lower with the press of a button.
