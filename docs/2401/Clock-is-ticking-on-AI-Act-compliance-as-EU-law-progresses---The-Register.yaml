    have urged organizations using the tech to closely monitor the legislation's progress
    as some businesses may have up to a year to conform.

    us organizations might have only six to 12 months to prepare for most rules and
    restrictions, while providers of high-risk systems will be encouraged to meet
    the regulations much before.

    be ready by the end of this legislative period."'

    of AI, as set out in the draft act, explained Tanguy Van Overstraeten, partner
    and global head of privacy and data protection with law firm Linklaters. The legislators
    are proposing a pyramid system in which some categories will be expected to comply
    with the rules sooner than others.

    such as OpenAI's ChatGPT. "They talked about general-purpose AI because they want
    to be broader than just generative AI. Although there is no real scientific definition,
    they wanted it to be broader than systems made for generating text," Van Overstraeten

    Van Overstraeten 说。
- en: To comply with the law, the EU said general-purpose AI models would need to
    meet certain criteria. They will have to conduct model evaluations, assess and
    mitigate systemic risks, conduct adversarial testing, report serious incidents
    to the European Commission, ensure cybersecurity, and report on their energy efficiency,
    according to the provisional agreement.

- en: The proposed AI Act has attracted criticism for burdening research. Last year,
    Meta's chief AI scientist, Yann LeCun, said regulating foundation models was effectively
    regulating research and development. "There is absolutely no reason for it, except
    for highly speculative and improbable scenarios. Regulating products is fine.
    But [regulating] R&D is ridiculous."
