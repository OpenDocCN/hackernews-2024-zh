- en: RTX Remix is not a “one button” solution to remastering. While producing a mod
    with full ray tracing in RTX Remix is relatively straightforward, if the game
    assets are not upgraded to possess physically accurate materials, the mod will
    not likely look right; the likelihood is many textures will look uniformly shiny
    or matte.

    Glass reflects the world with clear detail, while laminate wood flooring has rough,
    coarse reflections. And stone, though without visible reflections, is still capable
    of bouncing light and having an effect on the scene. Without taking advantage
    of PBR, the modder is not fully taking advantage of full ray tracing.

    textures to physically accurate materials. But the most impressive RTX Remix projects
    (like *Portal With RTX*, *Portal: Prelude RTX* and *Half Life 2 RTX: An RTX Remix
    Project*) are chock full of lovingly hand made high quality assets with enormous
    polygonal counts and realistic materials. The best Blender artists will revel
    in being able to bring their carefully crafted assets into games without compromising
    on their visuals.'

- en: The most ambitious mods also see modders customize and add new lights to each
    scene to account for how the game now looks with realistic lighting and shadowing.
    This relighting step can allow for all the advantages of path traced lights while
    preserving the look of the original game.

- en: When used alongside traditional modding tools, like Valve’s Hammer Editor, RTX
    Remix can make mods even more spectacular. Modders can reinvent particle systems
    and redesign aspects of the game RTX Remix can not interface with– for example
    the level design, the physics, and in-game AI.
