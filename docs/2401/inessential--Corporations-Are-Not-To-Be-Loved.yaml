- en: I started using Apple computers — and writing code for them, starting with BASIC
    — 43 years ago, before the Macintosh, even, and I’ve made this my career. I’ve
    had all these decades to really, thoroughly delight in these incredible machines
    and software, and to give a little back with my own apps.

    (lovingly, teasingly) said to me that my alternate career, had all this never
    happened, was “criminal genius.” Which might have been fun too, but possibly more
    stressful than I might have liked. At any rate, Apple has saved me from a life
    of crime, and I should love Apple for that.

    aren’t people, and they can’t love you back. You wouldn’t love GE or Exxon or
    Comcast — and you shouldn’t love Apple. It’s not an exception to the rule: there
    are no exceptions.'

    in their way somehow, they would do whatever their might — effectively infinite
    compared to your own — enables them to deal with you.

- en: Luckily, Apple has just provided us all with a reminder. Just like the sixth
    finger in an AI-rendered hand, Apple’s policies for [Distributing apps in the
    U.S. that provide an external purchase link](https://developer.apple.com/support/storekit-external-entitlement-us/)
    are startlingly graceless and a jarring, but not surprising, reminder that Apple
    is not a real person and not worthy of your love.
