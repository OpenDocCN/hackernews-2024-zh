# Assassin's Creed publisher Ubisoft facing lawsuit for shutting down fan-favourite game

## We can't help but wonder if this lawsuit is a wise move...?

We’re sure Ubisoft must be quaking in its boots right now because of a lawsuit being brought against it by a seriously disgruntled fan.

The issue comes from [Ubisoft](https://www.gamingbible.com/ubisoft) cancelling and shutting down a fan-favourite title. We reported on the [sad news back in December 2023](https://www.gamingbible.com/news/platform/steam/ubisoft-removes-popular-game-from-steam-forever-812652-20231215#:~:text=Unfortunately%2C%20we%20bring%20sad%20news,the%20end%20of%20March%202024.), and although fans have had a few weeks to come to terms with the news, it seems not all of them will accept it.

YouTuber Ross Scott, aka Accursed Farms, has made it known that he intends to file a class-action lawsuit against the publishers for how it “took money” from *The Crew* gamers under the guise of a “perpetual licence”, yet, as Scott claims, this isn’t what they received.

“I think the argument to make is that *The Crew* was sold under a perpetual licence, not a subscription, so we were being sold a good, not a service,” Ross explains.

“Then the seller rendered the game unusable and deprived it of all value after the point of sale [...] This is a high-profile game that was sold in stores under a perpetual licence, and the buyers are going to be left with nothing. This is about as perfect an opportunity as we’re going to get to challenge the system on this.”

It’s a bold move, though not one we’re certain the YouTuber will be able to pull off against the [Assassin’s Creed](https://www.gamingbible.com/assassins-creed) publisher. Of course, the lawsuit might not even happen yet, as Scott is still amassing evidence from others affected by the closure of the game to see the potential the lawsuit actually has.

What is more, Scott says he anticipates that Ubisoft could go for a no-fault settlement, yet it’s a move he would push back against. “In that scenario, if I have any say in the matter, I will push to not accept any offer like that.” He adds, “The point is actually bigger than the game and bigger than Ubisoft. I’m trying to stop games people want to keep and pay money from being destroyed.”
