    And in some cases, what’s happening is absolutely nothing. The position doesn’t
    even exist. It’s called a ghost job. And about half of companies list jobs they
    don’t necessarily intend to fill because they’re “always open to new people,”
    [according to a survey from Clarify Capital](https://clarifycapital.com/job-seekers-beware-of-ghost-jobs-survey).
    Kaplan said this tactic isn’t new.

    and gets laid off or forgets to take them down once they’re filled. But sometimes
    employers post ghost jobs on purpose so that to investors it looks like the company
    is growing, and to overworked and frustrated employees it looks like help is on
    the way.'

    in fact, make contact with candidates and interview them, just so you have a large
    pool of talent,” said Kaplan. “But you don’t plan on actually filling the job
    anytime soon or hiring.”

    be more common now because businesses are anxious. They laid off workers at the
    beginning of the pandemic, then had a hard time hiring them back when they needed
    them. They laid people off again when wages and interest rates rose. Now, they’re
    waiting for the economy to give them the green light to grow again.

    Now, Salemi encourages job seekers to apply anyway. If you do get an interview,
    ask about the company’s hiring timeline.

    you discover that what they say they’re now backtracking, that is a sign of their

    I’d want to be part of?'”
