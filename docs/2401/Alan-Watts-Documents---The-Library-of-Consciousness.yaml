- en: Alan Wilson Watts was a British philosopher, writer, speaker, and self-styled
    “philosophical entertainer,” best known as an interpreter and popularizer of Eastern
    philosophy for a Western audience. Born in Chislehurst, England, he moved to the
    United States in 1938 and began Zen training in New York. Pursuing a career, he
    attended Seabury-Western Theological Seminary, where he received a master’s degree
    in theology. Watts became an Episcopal priest in 1945, then left the ministry
    in 1950 and moved to California, where he joined the faculty of the American Academy
    of Asian Studies.

    a volunteer programmer at KPFA, a Pacifica Radio station in Berkeley. Watts wrote
    more than 25 books and articles on subjects important to Eastern and Western religion,
    introducing the then-burgeoning youth culture to *The Way of Zen*, one of the
    first bestselling books on Buddhism. Towards the end of his life, he divided his
    time between a houseboat in Sausalito and a cabin on Mount Tamalpais.
