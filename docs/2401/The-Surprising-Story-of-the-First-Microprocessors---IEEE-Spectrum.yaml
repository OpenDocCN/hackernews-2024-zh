    engineers had figured out how to combine multiple bipolar transistors into single
    integrated circuits. But because of the complex structure of these transistors,
    an integrated circuit could contain only a small number of them. So although a

    could build a processor for the Datapoint 2200\. CTC gave engineers at TI the
    computer’s specifications and told them to go ahead. When they returned with a
    three-chip design, CTC pointedly asked whether TI could build it on one chip,
    as Intel was doing. TI then started working on a single-chip CPU for CTC around
    April 1970\. That design, completed the next year, was first called the [TMX 1795](https://en.wikichip.org/wiki/ti/tmx1795)

    After testing the TMC 1795, CTC rejected it, opting to continue building its processor

    chip (which after some minor improvements became known as the TMC 1795A) to various
    companies. [Ford Motor Co.](https://corporate.ford.com/homepage.html) showed interest
    in using the chip as an engine controller in 1971, causing Boone to write, “I
    think we have walked into the mass market our ‘CPU-on-a-chip’ desperately needs.”
    Alas, these efforts failed, and TI ceased marketing the TMC 1795, focusing on
    its more profitable calculator chips instead. Nevertheless, if you want to assign
