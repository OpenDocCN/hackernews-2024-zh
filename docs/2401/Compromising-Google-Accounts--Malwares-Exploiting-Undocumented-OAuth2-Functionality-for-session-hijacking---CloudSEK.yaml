- en: In October 2023, PRISMA, a developer, uncovered a critical exploit that allows
    the generation of persistent Google cookies through token manipulation. This exploit
    enables continuous access to Google services, even after a user's password reset.
    A client, a threat actor, later reverse-engineered this script and incorporated
    it into Lumma Infostealer *(See Appendix8)*, protecting the methodology with advanced
    blackboxing techniques. This marked the beginning of a ripple effect, as the exploit
    rapidly spread among various malware groups to keep on par with unique features.

    the undocumented Google OAuth2 MultiLogin endpoint provides a textbook example
    of such sophistication.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'Lumma''s approach hinges on a nuanced manipulation of the token:GAIA ID pair,
    a critical component in Google''s authentication process. This pair, when used
    in conjunction with the MultiLogin endpoint, enables the regeneration of Google
    service cookies. Lumma''s strategic innovation lies in the encryption of this
    token:GAIA ID pair with their proprietary private keys. By doing so, they effectively
    ''blackbox'' the exploitation process, shrouding the core mechanics of the exploit
    in secrecy. This blackboxing serves two purposes:'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Protection of the Exploit Technique**: By applying encryption to the pivotal
    token:GAIA ID pair, Lumma effectively masks the core mechanism of their exploit.
    This layer of encryption acts as a barrier, hindering other malicious entities
    from duplicating their method. This strategic move not only preserves the uniqueness
    of their exploit in the competitive landscape of cybercrime but also provides
    them with an edge in the illicit market. However, Lumma''s subsequent adaptation,
    which introduced the use of SOCKS proxies to circumvent Google''s IP-based restrictions
    on cookie regeneration, inadvertently exposed some details of the requests and
    responses, potentially compromising the exploit''s obscurity.'

- en: While we await a comprehensive solution from Google, users can take immediate
    action to safeguard against this exploit. If you suspect your account may have
    been compromised, or as a general precaution, sign out of all browser profiles
    to invalidate the current session tokens. Following this, reset your password
    and sign back in to generate new tokens. This is especially crucial for users
    whose tokens and GAIA IDs might have been exfiltrated. Resetting your password
    effectively disrupts unauthorized access by invalidating the old tokens which
    the [infostealers](/tag/infostealer) rely on, thus providing a crucial barrier
    to the continuation of their exploit.
