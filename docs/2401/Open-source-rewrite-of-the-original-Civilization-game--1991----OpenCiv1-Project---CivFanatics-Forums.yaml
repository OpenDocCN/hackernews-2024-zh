- en: -There's a bad bug in the save logic which means that if you save whilst some
    units still have moves left in your turn, all units will have all their moves
    back on the same turn when you resume (DOS actually had this bug too, but it only
    effected autosaves, so to trigger it, you had to manually shift a save to the
    autosave slot then load it). Windows does this every time you save.

    DOS.

    as actual diplomacy begins, in DOS it continues playing (also, as with the title
    screen, the tracks are very short unless you mod them)

    This means you can't have scenarios with custom unit names, you can with DOS.

    and unit graphics/colour scheme from the DOS version. This could be an optional
    choice of course. Particularly the choice of burgundy and yellow for the city
    screen is a bit of a shocker in my opinion!

    3 patch which introduces 'very unhappy citizens', in DOS they are coloured red
    on the city menu, in Windows there's no visual clue to differentiate them from
    'normal' citizens (see this thread for discussion
