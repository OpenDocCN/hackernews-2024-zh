    not start a natural highs movement where they could become influenced to change
    their brain chemistry in positive ways that would benefit themselves and the society?
    And so, in 1992, a legendary African American dance choreographer Cleo Parker
    Robinson and I were awarded $1.2 million to start the natural highs program for
    at-risk youth. And we gave them music and art and dance and whatever they really
    wanted to learn in the area of healthy recreational activities, and then we also
    gave them a mindfulness program so that they could learn the skills to manage
    their own thinking. And we were tremendously successful at that, and that''s when
    the conversations really started with Iceland about offering people healthy ways
    to change their brain chemistry."'
