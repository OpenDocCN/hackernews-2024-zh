    in Europe — with more than 40 percent of 15- and 16-year-olds reporting being
    drunk in a given month.

    drug-taking youth on the continent. The turnaround is credited, partly, to an
    American psychologist and drug researcher who was convinced that replacing artificial
    highs with natural highs — before addiction began — could change a society.

    the heroin users were characterized by passive withdrawal, in terms of their style
    of coping with stress. And the amphetamine users were opposite. They were characterized
    by active confrontation, so they were active, extroverted people who were playing
    all-night music, they were doing construction work, and when they were in distress,
    they wanted to amp up their level of active confrontation with their environment."'

    they getting addicted to changes in their brain chemistry.'' And then we knew
    we were on to something..."'

    its own mind-altering chemicals. And if people are getting addicted to self-induced
    changes in brain chemistry that could be translated into drugs or behaviors, why
    not start a natural highs movement where they could become influenced to change
    their brain chemistry in positive ways that would benefit themselves and the society?
    And so, in 1992, a legendary African American dance choreographer Cleo Parker
    Robinson and I were awarded $1.2 million to start the natural highs program for
    at-risk youth. And we gave them music and art and dance and whatever they really
    wanted to learn in the area of healthy recreational activities, and then we also
    gave them a mindfulness program so that they could learn the skills to manage
    their own thinking. And we were tremendously successful at that, and that''s when
    the conversations really started with Iceland about offering people healthy ways
    to change their brain chemistry."'

    kids — school teachers, coaches, nurses, doctors and even corporations. So they
    all got together and decided, ''We''re going to have this as a kind of a collaborative
    effort to help kids.'' So it''s important to realize that working with the surveys,
    they discovered that the things that really stood out in terms of what was correlated
    with high drug abuse were, how strong were the relationships with the family?
    How much time was the family spending with the kids? What kind of peer groups
    with the kids hanging around with? And really important was the available recreational
    activities."'

    spending with your kid every day? And during the week? And then people were able
    to get that message, and the whole country got the idea that it really is important
    to spend time with your kids. And so from 1997 to 2012, the time spent with parents
    doubled for 15- to 16-year-old-kids, and then they had a corresponding reduction
    in substance abuse and other problem behaviors."'

    for sure in the United States that can replicate the Icelandic model. We have
    17 different countries in Europe that are doing it across 35 different municipalities.
    We have a Youth In Europe project. Certainly that would be a, I think, a beneficial
    effect, a special sort of aspect of solving these problems is to recognize community
    by community what the problems are, and then tackle them in terms of the resources
    that the community has, let them solve some of their own problems through their
