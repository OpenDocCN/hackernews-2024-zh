- en: I have my last exam for my Analysis class tomorrow.  What surprised me most
    about the class was the amount of counterintuitive examples that arise in every
    area.  Here's a few I like.

- en: The Heine-Borel theorem says that every closed and bounded subset of the reals
    is compact.  However this does not extended to other metric spaces.  Take X =
    (0,1).  S = (0,1/2] is a closed and bounded subset of X, but it is not compact
    in X.  Dang.

- en: The Cantor Set.  Everything about it is counterintuitive.  Cantor was really
    trying to make life harder for people.  It's closed, contains no positive length
    interval, and uncountable.  The application of his diagonal argument to show the
    set is uncountable is great.

- en: Compact spaces are nice.  Make life a lot easier.  Things fall apart when the
    space is not compact.  Your sequences may converge but not to an element in your
    space.

- en: A set can be S can be the set of discontinuities for a function f iff it is
    the union of countably many closed subsets.  At first I got this but then I realized
    it means there can be some function that is continuous at all the irrationals
    and discontinuous at all the rationals.  And then I got home and looked it up: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomae%27s_function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomae%27s_function)
    .

- en: I learned about conditional and absolute convergence of series in high school. 
    I was unaware though that if a series is only conditionally convergent then you
    can find a rearrangement **which diverges** along with different arrangements
    that sum to every real number.  It almost feels like cheating, saying that a given
    series converges when in reality you can shuffle it around and it's an absolute
    mess.

    a few years ago and took for granted.  We can always understand things on a deeper
    level.
