## A completely new browser engine built from scratch

Vox focuses on performance and minimal resource usage. It will make your device feel snappy again.

Using Hacker News as a test (JS disabled in all browsers):

*   20x faster rendering than Chrome (3ms vs 60ms)
*   4x less RAM usage than FireFox
*   40% less CPU usage than FireFox

Vox is still in alpha.

Builds for Windows/macOS/Linux are available.
