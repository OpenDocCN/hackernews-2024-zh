- en: I am preemptively disappointed by the Apple Vision Pro. Not because it isn’t
    an absolute marvel of engineering, but because of what its operating system affords
    user to do.

- en: For a while I have been reading the book The Innovators by Walter Isaacson,
    which goes into depth on the history of the personal computer and development
    of the internet. One thing that was common throughout the majority of the founders
    of these tech companies was that they grew up tinkering with hardware and later
    software.

- en: As I have experienced this tendency in myself while I was younger (around 12,
    which translates to around 2012) to start tinkering with computers, I think this
    is absolutely crucial in the development of a young mind to become fluent in working
    with these machines.

    of the bay area, I grew up with software and devices that were much more closed
    off and user friendly.

    level slightly higher than what would have been ideal to truly grasp the workings
    of computers.

- en: Now that I’m a bit older (23) and finally took the plunge from the safe environment
    of games and game engines to the “scary” C++ without abstractions, I realise how
    much quicker I could have developed if I hadn’t been so spoiled with closed of
    devices such as iPads and game consoles.

- en: The operating system of the Apple Vision Pro is a glorified version of iPadOS,
    which hides away so much of what a computer is able to do and how it works, that
    if a new generation of children get exposed to these types of devices, they won’t
    be able to tinker, explore and learn.
  prefs: []

- en: These devices are glorified app and game launchers, with at most a dumbed down
    controlled environment, perfectly didactically responsible, “Swift Playgrounds”.
    Children need to tinker with software. Break things apart. They need to see what
    makes it tick.

    for the openness of macOS, on the Apple Vision Pro.

    Not as glorified game and app launchers. It will increase productivity and enable
    children to become the next wave of entrepreneurs.
