    Show in Las Vegas this week. Coming to grips with this high-tech culinary wonder
    is a little bit like that meme of an [expanding brain](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/galaxy-brain).

    is just a sexy-looking, $5,999 appliance: sleek black glass, burners that resemble
    a DJ turntable, knobs that add a satisfying analog touch to an otherwise fully
    digital interface.'

    burners at the precise temperature you want.

    most other induction stoves, it can plug into a standard 120-volt outlet. You
    don’t have to get a pricy circuit upgrade, or an even pricier electrical panel
    upgrade, to install it.

    And you can still cook if the power goes out. And [its eligible for a 30% tax

    device that can charge up when power is cheap in the morning so that you save
    money when you use it in the evening, when power prices are highest. You can also
    participate in programs that will pay you to dispatch power from your stove to
    the grid when demand is high.

    while he was at CES, to learn more about the story behind the stove. We talked
    about pizza, why induction cooking is the wedge to getting whole homes off gas,
    and his vision for putting a battery in every appliance. Our conversation has
    been lightly edited for clarity.

    was on the solar car team and actually wrote battery management firmware as part
    of that. That gave me my first taste in electrification. You had to build a full
    EV and drive it across Australia. Then I immediately got sucked into consumer
    electronics and worked on a number of devices, including Google Glass, Oculus.

- en: Part of the thesis for Impulse is, home appliances really haven’t seen a lot
    of innovation in 50 years or so. There’s been a number of advances in consumer
    electronics, so being able to take a lot of the talent and supply chain and experience
    from that and apply it to the appliance space is underleveraged.

- en: I was in Japan at a conference, and we went to this pizza place and they cooked
    my pizza in like 45 seconds. And I’m like, that is insane. I think it’s called
    Savoy Pizza, you should definitely go to it. Tastiest pizza I’ve ever had. Super
    memorable. And then I’m like, I want to do that. But can I make it a tabletop
    device in my house?
  prefs: []

- en: And so I was getting obsessive with how to replicate that, but I realized you
    couldn’t do it on a 120-volt plug. I basically realized you had to put a battery
    in the appliance to be able to boost the power above what a 120 volt provides.
    All of the oven and smart appliance companies were really focused on AI and computer
    vision at that time, because they couldn’t innovate on the performance characteristics
    — they were topped out. And I realized this was an end run around that. You could
    actually make something that was three times better on the performance side, not
    have to worry about AI features that maybe no one is going to use, and really
    do some innovation.

    that storage for the building. And then that kind of expanded into what became
    Impulse.

- en: So the first product is a cooktop. The idea here was we realized that the key
    appliance to getting gas out of the home was the stove. People don’t know what
    the fuel source is for all of their other appliances, including ovens. The big
    thing with gas stoves is that the user experience is the flame. So being able
    to address that, we thought, was fundamental to building decarbonization.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Utility companies know this. They know that getting people to get a gas stove
    is the way to get them off electric heat and on to gas heat. The wedge is actually
    the gas stove. So by producing an appliance that is just way more compelling,
    we can sever that dependency.
  prefs: []

    of performance of around 45 seconds is possible.

    the perfect stove is?**'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That was the fun part. We started buying hot plates and stoves and tearing them
    down. We basically realized that a lot of this stuff just hadn’t been attempted
    because the power wasn’t available. So the first thing we did was try to crank
    a ton of power into the stove. So we were like, let’s do 10 kilowatts, because
    10 is a big number. That let us boil a liter of water in 40 seconds. We had that
    demo working in March or April of 2022\.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But we realized immediately that this was too much performance unless you could
    solve the controls problem. The reason why people complain about warped pans and
    various other things is because the stove gets too hot. We then started tearing
    down all the hot plates and stoves we could find that had temperature sensors
    in them, and we realized that no one’s actually addressed this, and we found that
    there was a lot of leverage there that let us unlock the full performance of the
    stove. And so we’re monitoring the temperature in real time, making sure that
    we’re delivering the appropriate amount of power for the level you want to set,
    so that it holds a specific temperature.

    dinner, is that possible with this? Or will the battery drain and then you can’t
    use it for a little bit?**'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You’re going to be okay, yes. You’ll drain the battery if you’re, let’s say,
    boiling a big pot of water for pasta. But then once it’s at temperature, you’re
    not going to be drawing more than what a 120-volt plug would draw. Maybe you’re
    stir-frying something. That pan, when it’s heating up, maybe it’s drawing a couple
    kilowatts for a minute, but then once everything’s up to temperature, you’re drawing
    hundreds of watts, and the battery is charging.
  prefs: []

- en: So basically, the average power draw [when you cook] is appropriate for even
    a 120-volt plug. It’s just that the peak power is more like an EV charger, or
    like an electric radiant heater, or something crazy. And that mismatch between
    peak and average is where the opportunity for putting batteries in appliances
    really shines.

    be for the grid?**'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There’s a couple of ways to weigh how valuable that is. In Southern California,
    which has really strong time-of-use energy rates, in the 4 to 9 pm slot, [using
    electricity during] that peak window is like 20 cents more expensive per kilowatt-hour
    than outside that window. So if you charge the battery outside the window and
    then you discharge the battery, whether it’s cooking or it’s putting power back
    into the house, inside that window, it’s worth hundreds of dollars a year in terms
    of energy bill savings.

    and make those choices semi-autonomously. We’re likely going to expose some level
    of choice to the end user, but we haven’t finalized the design.

    appliances. It will make you a better cook. You will be able to do things faster
    and more efficiently.
  prefs: []

- en: Two is, you will be like, “I want to get an induction stove, I heard that’s
    a good thing to get.” And then your electricians will come by and tell you that
    you only have 10 amps available on your electric panel, and you’re going to be
    sad. And so we also solve that problem.

- en: And then the third one is, now we’ve put some energy storage in your house.
    There’s 140 million homes in America. If we can intercept three major appliances
    per home, or four major appliances per home, that’s like 1.4 terawatt-hours of
    storage deployment potential. There’s an opportunity to deploy storage every year
    just by people upgrading their appliances. And so that’s part of the end game.
    Utilities will like that because it means they don’t have to invest in all this
    expensive transmission infrastructure.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Do you want to make other products besides stoves?**'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Yeah. We want to make the best appliances across the board. There’s a number
    of logical options, anything that has high peak but low average draw is the low
    hanging fruit. So you can imagine ovens — they draw power when they pre-heat.
    Water heaters are another one, where it’s like, if you’re taking a shower, it
    consumes a ton of power, but when you’re not, it doesn’t. Laundry is another one.
    I also want to emphasize that we’re making relatively high-end, premium appliances
    to start, but this architecture scales down fairly well to mid-range products.
    It’s just that as a startup, just as Tesla started with sports cars, we have to
    kind of start with the lower-volume, higher-margin products and then scale up
    from there.

- en: You can preorder it today on ImpulseLabs.com. There’s about 45% in federal discounts
    available. Because this thing has a battery and an inverter, it’s an energy storage
    product. It gets a 30% investment tax credit. A big change under the IRA was that
    stationary batteries, sold separately from solar, get that credit now. And then
    there’s also an $840 electric stove rebate that is available under the IRA. That
    one is income gated and expected to roll out in the fall. Our products are going
    to be available in Q4, so we expect the timing to be appropriate where all those
    rebates and credits will be available.
