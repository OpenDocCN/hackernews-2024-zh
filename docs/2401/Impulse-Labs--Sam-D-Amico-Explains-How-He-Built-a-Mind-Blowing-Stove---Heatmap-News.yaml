    device that can charge up when power is cheap in the morning so that you save

    was on the solar car team and actually wrote battery management firmware as part
    of that. That gave me my first taste in electrification. You had to build a full
    EV and drive it across Australia. Then I immediately got sucked into consumer
    electronics and worked on a number of devices, including Google Glass, Oculus.

- en: Part of the thesis for Impulse is, home appliances really haven’t seen a lot
    of innovation in 50 years or so. There’s been a number of advances in consumer

    from that and apply it to the appliance space is underleveraged.

    my pizza in like 45 seconds. And I’m like, that is insane. I think it’s called
    Savoy Pizza, you should definitely go to it. Tastiest pizza I’ve ever had. Super

- en: And so I was getting obsessive with how to replicate that, but I realized you
    couldn’t do it on a 120-volt plug. I basically realized you had to put a battery
    in the appliance to be able to boost the power above what a 120 volt provides.
    All of the oven and smart appliance companies were really focused on AI and computer
    vision at that time, because they couldn’t innovate on the performance characteristics
    — they were topped out. And I realized this was an end run around that. You could
    actually make something that was three times better on the performance side, not
    have to worry about AI features that maybe no one is going to use, and really
    do some innovation.

  zh: 因此，我开始着迷于如何复制那个过程，但我意识到你无法在120伏特的插座上做到这一点。我基本上意识到你必须在设备中放置一个电池，以便能够将功率提高到120伏特提供的以上水平。当时，所有的烤箱和智能家电公司都非常专注于人工智能和计算机视觉，因为他们无法在性能特性上进行创新——他们已经达到了顶峰。而我意识到这是一个绕过的方法。你实际上可以制造出在性能方面提升三倍的东西，不必担心也许没有人会使用的人工智能功能，并真正进行一些创新。

    appliance to getting gas out of the home was the stove. People don’t know what
    the fuel source is for all of their other appliances, including ovens. The big
    thing with gas stoves is that the user experience is the flame. So being able
    to address that, we thought, was fundamental to building decarbonization.

- en: Utility companies know this. They know that getting people to get a gas stove
    is the way to get them off electric heat and on to gas heat. The wedge is actually
    the gas stove. So by producing an appliance that is just way more compelling,
    we can sever that dependency.

    down. We basically realized that a lot of this stuff just hadn’t been attempted
    because the power wasn’t available. So the first thing we did was try to crank
    a ton of power into the stove. So we were like, let’s do 10 kilowatts, because
    10 is a big number. That let us boil a liter of water in 40 seconds. We had that
    demo working in March or April of 2022\.

  zh: 那是有趣的一部分。我们开始购买热板和炉灶，然后拆解它们。我们基本上意识到很多这样的东西之所以没有被尝试，是因为没有足够的电力。所以我们做的第一件事就是试图将大量的电力注入炉灶中。所以我们说，让我们做10千瓦，因为10是一个很大的数字。这让我们能够在40秒内将一升水煮沸。我们在2022年的三月或四月就让这个演示工作了。
- en: But we realized immediately that this was too much performance unless you could
    solve the controls problem. The reason why people complain about warped pans and
    various other things is because the stove gets too hot. We then started tearing
    down all the hot plates and stoves we could find that had temperature sensors
    in them, and we realized that no one’s actually addressed this, and we found that
    there was a lot of leverage there that let us unlock the full performance of the
    stove. And so we’re monitoring the temperature in real time, making sure that
    we’re delivering the appropriate amount of power for the level you want to set,
    so that it holds a specific temperature.

    stir-frying something. That pan, when it’s heating up, maybe it’s drawing a couple

- en: So basically, the average power draw [when you cook] is appropriate for even
    a 120-volt plug. It’s just that the peak power is more like an EV charger, or

    which has really strong time-of-use energy rates, in the 4 to 9 pm slot, [using
    electricity during] that peak window is like 20 cents more expensive per kilowatt-hour
    than outside that window. So if you charge the battery outside the window and
    then you discharge the battery, whether it’s cooking or it’s putting power back
    into the house, inside that window, it’s worth hundreds of dollars a year in terms
    of energy bill savings.

  zh: 有几种方式可以衡量这种价值。在南加州，那里的分时用电费率非常高，在下午4点至9点的高峰时段，[在这一时段使用电力]比其他时段每千瓦时贵20美分。所以如果你在非高峰时段充电，然后在高峰时段放电，无论是用于烹饪还是将电力送回到房屋，每年都能在电费上节省数百美元。

    Water heaters are another one, where it’s like, if you’re taking a shower, it
    consumes a ton of power, but when you’re not, it doesn’t. Laundry is another one.
    I also want to emphasize that we’re making relatively high-end, premium appliances
    to start, but this architecture scales down fairly well to mid-range products.
    It’s just that as a startup, just as Tesla started with sports cars, we have to
    kind of start with the lower-volume, higher-margin products and then scale up
