    private key online that gave “unrestricted access” to the company’s source code,
    according to the security research firm that discovered it.

    TechCrunch to the exposure and asked for help in disclosing to the car maker.
    The London-based cybersecurity company said it discovered a Mercedes employee’s
    authentication token in a public GitHub repository during a routine internet scan
    in January.

    to GitHub — could grant anyone full access to Mercedes’s GitHub Enterprise Server,
    thus allowing the download of the company’s private source code repositories.

    source code hosted at the internal GitHub Enterprise Server,” Mittal explained
    in a report shared by TechCrunch. “The repositories include a large amount of
    intellectual property… connection strings, cloud access keys, blueprints, design
    documents, [single sign-on] passwords, API Keys, and other critical internal information.”

    Microsoft Azure and Amazon Web Services (AWS) keys, a Postgres database, and Mercedes
    source code. It’s not known if any customer data was contained within the repositories.
