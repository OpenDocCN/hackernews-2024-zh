    Detroit Lions. Trailing by 14, they scored a touchdown with 5 minutes left to
    go in the game, bringing them to within 8\. After the touchdown, they decided
    to go for a two-point conversion to make it a six-point game. The conversion failed,
    and the Bucs would eventually lose because Coach Todd Bowles forgot to use his
    final timeout.

    on a longwinded explanation of why analytics say going for two down eight is always
    the right move. I tweeted that [Cris Collinsworth lecturing the world on probability

    is not only related to what I posted [on Friday about Pro Football Focus](https://www.argmin.net/p/algorithmic-impacts-of-jocks-versus)
    but aligned with this blog’s insurgence against probabilistic reasoning. But then
    the world moved on to explain why Josh Allen is the new Philip Rivers, and I decided
    to work on blogs about the algorithmic intricacies of confidence intervals.

    Kimes is the smartest person covering the NFL on ESPN. She’s probably the smartest
    person covering the NFL period. And though I doubt she’ll read this, she inspired
    me to write down why the G42D8 madness is flat-out wrong.

- en: The G42D8 probability calculations out there on the internet are naive and don’t
    take into account all possibilities. They suggest G42D8 increases the probability
    of winning by over 12%, while more realistic calculations show the strategy increases
    the chances of winning by less than 1% (at best!). Even worse, the G42D8 calculations
    appeal to the inverse gambler’s fallacy, assuming that the probabilities of events
    do not change with time or context. But if you don’t assume that all events in
    football can be reduced to biased coin-flipping, then you can’t say much at all.
    You must understand the context before throwing a fade route in a vain attempt
    to go down by 6.

    even more, let’s also assume that extra points are always made. Under this model,
    if you kick extra points after each touchdown, you go to overtime and win with
    a probability of 50%.

    There are now two cases. In case 1, you make the 2-point conversion, kick the
    extra point, and win. In case 2, you miss the 2-point conversion and attempt another
    2-point conversion on the next touchdown. The probability of your second 2-point
    attempt succeeding is again P. If you get the 2nd 2 pointer, you go to overtime
    and win with probability 50%. Combining these two possibilities, the probability
    of winning is

    thing where it assumes the probability that you stop the other team and score
    a touchdown is 1\. What if you factored in the chances of stopping the other team

    is assuming every drive is probabilistically independent of each other. The probability
    of scoring on any drive is constant throughout a game. It doesn’t depend on the
    score. The probabilities don’t depend on the time left. And they don’t depend
    on anything the teams actually do during the game. Anyone who has watched any
    football knows this isn’t true. But it’s a start for calculating stuff! So let’s
    press on.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Under these assumptions, Laura uses a computational technique called Dynamic
    Programming to evaluate all possible scenarios in the game tree. Once you factor
    in this more complex set of possibilities, the “62.5%” mirage disappears. Laura
    finds that if you are down by 2 TDs, G42D8 increases your probability of winning
    *by less than 1%*.
  prefs: []

    bros on the internet comparing this to the Monty Hall problem and yelling about
    how “it’s elementary math” are telling on themselves. The full computations of
    the actual probabilities are hard! And if you add any degree of realism, the story
    is not cut and dry at all. Under completely unrealistic assumptions, G42D8 improves
    the chances of winning by less 1%. If there is *any* uncertainty in these calculations
    at all, then you might even be putting yourself at a disadvantage!
  prefs: []

- en: This brings me to my final point. Even Laura’s calculation assumes that each
    sequential event in football is independent of everything that’s happened before.
    Anyone who has watched any football knows this isn’t true. If this *were* true,
    teams would go for two every time. Teams would never try to make half-time adjustments.
    Teams would never use trick plays.

    of outcomes in football games. There are different stadiums and weather conditions.
    Defenses can get winded if they’re on the field too long. Even a tiny hamstring
    tweak can change the explosiveness of a receiver. The hot hand is real.

    momentum shows they don’t mean the same thing as how it’s defined in classical
    physics. But that doesn’t mean the concept doesn’t exist. Part of football is
    intimidation and getting the other team to mentally beat itself. I concede that
    teams’ mental states can change at the drop of the hat with a foolish fake punt
    or a fumble out of the back of the endzone. But that doesn’t mean their states
    of confidence and aggression aren’t real.

    Mike Vrabel figured the Dolphins were soft and went for 2 when down 8 as an intimidation
    tactic. The Titans converted, the Dolphins looked sad and defeated, and the Titans
    went on to win the game.
