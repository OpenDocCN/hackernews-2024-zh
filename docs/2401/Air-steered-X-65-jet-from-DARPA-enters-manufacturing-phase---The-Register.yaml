    by Boeing subsidiary Aurora Flight Sciences, who scored a [contract](https://www.theregister.com/2023/01/18/boeing_x_plane_darpa/)
    with the Defense Department last year as part of the Control of Revolutionary
    Aircraft with Novel Effectors (CRANE) program.

  zh: X-65由波音子公司奥罗拉飞行科学公司制造，该公司去年作为革命性飞机控制项目的一部分与国防部签订了合同。
- en: The key technology being explored as part of CRANE is known as active flow control
    (AFC), which relies on directed jets of pressurized air to steer the aircraft
    instead of flaps and rudders.

    CRANE program director Kevin Uleck. "As we move into the manufacturing phase,
    we are getting ever closer to fulfilling the goal of validating AFC technology
    and helping to open the design trade space for future applications."'

- en: Aurora said AFC has potential applications in the military and civilian worlds
    for its potential to reduce aircraft weight, improve aerodynamics, allow for new
    types of aircraft design and reduce mechanical complexity.

  zh: Aurora表示，AFC具有军事和民用领域的潜在应用，因其可以减轻飞机重量、改善空气动力学、实现新型飞机设计并减少机械复杂性。
- en: The production phase will culminate in a flight test of the 30-foot wingspan,
    7,000 lb unmanned aircraft at air speeds up to Mach 0.7\. Data from the test flight
    will be immediately applicable to real-world scenarios because the X-65 has size,
    weight and speed similar to military trainer aircraft, DARPA said. A set of 14
    AFC banks with independently-controllable air supply channels will be included
    in the craft.

  zh: 生产阶段将在30英尺翼展、7000磅无人机上进行飞行测试，飞行速度高达马赫0.7。DARPA表示，由于X-65具有与军用教练飞机相似的尺寸、重量和速度，测试飞行数据将立即适用于实际场景。飞行器将包括一套14个具有独立可控空气供应通道的AFC（主动流量控制）阀组。
- en: To gauge the effectiveness of AFC effectors compared to traditional flaps and
    rudders the X-65 will be built with both types. Traditional flight control will
    be used to establish a baseline of X-65 performance, and future flights will lock
    down various moving components to compare the performance of AFCs.

  zh: 为了评估AFC效应器与传统襟翼和方向舵的有效性，X-65将同时装备两种类型。将使用传统飞行控制来建立X-65性能的基线，未来的飞行将锁定各种移动部件以比较AFC的性能。
- en: '"The X-65 conventional surfaces are like training wheels to help us understand
    how AFC can be used in place of traditional flaps and rudders," said Richard Wlezien,
    CRANE program manager at DARPA. "We''ll have sensors in place to monitor how the
    AFC effectors'' performance compares with traditional control mechanisms."'

  zh: '"X-65的传统表面就像训练轮，帮助我们了解AFC如何代替传统的襟翼和方向舵，" DARPA的CRANE项目经理理查德·韦兹延说道。"我们将安装传感器来监测AFC效应器的性能与传统控制机制的性能相比如何。"'
- en: The X-65 will also have a modular design, allowing for parts to be swapped out
    for future test flights and different AFC designs. It's not immediately clear
    whether an X-65 will be built with both rudders and AFCs, or if parts will be
    swapped for test flights. Neither DARPA nor Aurora responded to questions.

  zh: X-65还将采用模块化设计，允许更换零部件进行未来的测试飞行和不同的AFC设计。目前尚不清楚X-65是否会同时具备方向舵和AFC，或者是否会更换零部件进行测试飞行。DARPA和Aurora均未回应相关问题。
- en: Preliminary tests, including critical design review, wind tunnel testing and
    scale-model construction have already been completed, and X-65 fabrication has
    begun at Aurora facilities in West Virginia and Mississippi, the Boeing subsidiary
    said. System integration and ground testing will take place at Aurora's headquarters
    in Virginia, and flight testing is targeted for Summer, 2025\. ®
