- en: I first encountered Professor Wirth remotely in my first college programming
    course, 203 Intro to Programming. We used Pascal as our programming language.
    I had been programming for 6 years by then, completely by the seat of my pants,
    in BASIC, FORTRAN, & 6800 assembly language.

    was *a* way to express a program & you’d better get used to it. So I did.

    Prolog, but I always remembered the utter simplicity of Pascal.

    lived in Zumikon, a village outside Zürich. On the ridge above the village was
    a remote control airplane landing strip. We would drive by & see the guys flying
    planes & helicopters.

- en: My third encounter with Professor Wirth was the one that would change my life.
    Toward the end of our stay in Switzerland I was invited to speak at a conference
    in Nice. Professor Wirth was speaking also. Somehow I found out that we shared
    flights so I did something I ordinarily would never do, I approached the ticket
    counter & said, “My colleague Professor Wirth & I are flying together. Would it
    be possible for us to sit together?” “Certainly, sir.”

    programming.

- en: Four hours later we boarded the plane. I sat down in the middle seat next to
    this wizened guy with disturbingly bright eyes. He looked non-plussed as I explained
    what I’d pulled to get there. We soon got to talking programming, though, & conversation
    flowed. Turns out that when he found out about the delay, he went home & programmed.
    Soon we were just a couple of geeks, sitting there talking geeking.

    the helicopter & the controller himself, in Oberon. That’s what he’d been doing
    at home—working on the flight control software.

- en: Extreme Programming was just starting to crackle & pop, so I’m sure I was a
    bit over-enthusiastic. After I had given an impassioned explanation of incremental
    design & refactoring, he paused, looked at me with those eyes, and, “I suppose
    that’s all very well if you don’t know how to design software.” Mic. Drop.

- en: Personal computing. The computer was a device to expand the human mind. His
    take on this (check out Oberon & descendants) was different than Forth or Smalltalk,
    but all shared the vision of human as crafter & computer as tool (a perspective
    we would do well to come back to).

- en: Geek for life. Professor Wirth was 70 when he was writing embedded software
    & he was thinking about it so intensely that he fit it even into the cracks of
    his life. I still have a ways to go to 70 (well, not *that* far), but I intend
    to keep geeking.

  zh: 终身极客。维尔斯教授在写嵌入式软件时已经70岁了，他对此思考得如此深入，以至于他甚至在生活的缝隙中也能找到时间。我还有一段路要走到70岁（好吧，并不*那么*遥远），但我打算一直保持极客精神。
