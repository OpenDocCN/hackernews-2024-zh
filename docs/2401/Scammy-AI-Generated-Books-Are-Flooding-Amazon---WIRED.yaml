    Women: How a Small Group of Faithful Women Exposed Abuse, Brought Down Powerful
    Pastors, and Ignited an Evangelical Reckoning*](https://www.amazon.com/Disobedient-Women-Faithful-Evangelical-Reckoning/dp/1546003800).

    Reckoning*](https://www.amazon.com/Disobedient-Women-Faithful-Evangelical-Reckoning/dp/1546003800)。摘要在几天内就出现在亚马逊上。其中一篇，她怀疑是基于普遍分发给评论员的预发行副本，甚至在她的书出版之前的那天就出现了。'
- en: Stankorb was aghast. *Disobedient Women* was the product of years of careful
    reporting. “It’s disturbing to me, and on multiple moral levels seems wrong, to
    pull the heart and sensitivity out of the stories,” she says. “And the language—it
    seemed like they just ran it through some sort of thesaurus program, and it came
    out really bizarre.”

  zh: Stankorb 感到震惊。*Disobedient Women* 是多年来仔细报道的成果。“这让我感到不安，从多个道德层面看似乎是错误的，从故事中抽取出心灵和敏感度，”
    她说。“还有用词——它看起来像他们只是通过某种同义词程序运行了它，结果变得非常奇怪。”

- en: Other IP experts aren’t so sure. There’s a big difference, after all, between
    CliffsNotes—which provide substantive analysis of a book in addition to summarizing
    it and are written by humans—and this newer wave of summaries clogging up Amazon.
    “Simply summarizing a book is harder to defend,” says James Grimmelmann, a professor
    of internet law at Cornell University. “There is still substantial similarity
    in the selection and arrangement of topics and probably some similarity in language
    as well.”

  zh: 其他知识产权专家并不确定。毕竟，CliffsNotes和这一新潮的摘要之间存在很大区别——CliffsNotes除了总结外，还提供了对书籍的实质性分析，并由人类撰写。“简单概括一本书更难辩护，”康奈尔大学互联网法教授詹姆斯·格里梅尔曼说。“在选题和排版上仍然存在实质性相似性，语言上也可能存在一些相似性。”

- en: Until an author actually files a lawsuit against the creator of one of these
    new generation summaries, their legality remains an open question. And although
    Amazon did take down Mitchell’s summary, it has not announced plans to proactively
    monitor this wave of summaries. “I hate that this is the new reality, but it would
    likely take a significant and recurring PR nightmare for a change in policy to
    occur at Amazon,” Friedman says.

    a new summary and uploading it tomorrow. “It’s ridiculous that Amazon doesn’t
    seem to be doing much to stop it,” Mitchell says. Then again, the publishing industry
    doesn’t seem to know quite how to handle this, either. Mitchell remembers the
