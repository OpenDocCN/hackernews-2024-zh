    reporting. “It’s disturbing to me, and on multiple moral levels seems wrong, to
    pull the heart and sensitivity out of the stories,” she says. “And the language—it
    seemed like they just ran it through some sort of thesaurus program, and it came
    out really bizarre.”

    on X, asking, “Is this legal?” Now, she has doubts she could successfully take
    anyone to court over this. “You can’t copyright the title of a book, I’ve been
    told,” Mitchell says. Usure of whether she has any recourse, she hasn’t contacted
    Amazon.

- en: Other IP experts aren’t so sure. There’s a big difference, after all, between
    CliffsNotes—which provide substantive analysis of a book in addition to summarizing
    it and are written by humans—and this newer wave of summaries clogging up Amazon.
    “Simply summarizing a book is harder to defend,” says James Grimmelmann, a professor
    of internet law at Cornell University. “There is still substantial similarity
    in the selection and arrangement of topics and probably some similarity in language
    as well.”

  zh: 其他知识产权专家并不确定。毕竟，CliffsNotes和这一新潮的摘要之间存在很大区别——CliffsNotes除了总结外，还提供了对书籍的实质性分析，并由人类撰写。“简单概括一本书更难辩护，”康奈尔大学互联网法教授詹姆斯·格里梅尔曼说。“在选题和排版上仍然存在实质性相似性，语言上也可能存在一些相似性。”
- en: Rasenberg of the Authors Guild sees a 2017 case where Penguin Random House sued
    authors who created children’s editions of its titles as a precedent that could
    help writers fight AI-generated summaries. The court [found](https://www.copyright.gov/fair-use/summaries/penguinrandomhouse-colting-sdny2017.pdf)
    that the children’s summaries were not legal, because they were primarily devoted
    to retelling copyrighted stories.

  zh: 作家公会的拉森伯格认为，企鹅兰登集团起诉那些为其作品创作儿童版的作者的2017年案件是一项先例，可以帮助作家们打击由人工智能生成的摘要。法院[发现](https://www.copyright.gov/fair-use/summaries/penguinrandomhouse-colting-sdny2017.pdf)这些儿童摘要不合法，因为它们主要是重新讲述受版权保护的故事。
- en: Until an author actually files a lawsuit against the creator of one of these
    new generation summaries, their legality remains an open question. And although
    Amazon did take down Mitchell’s summary, it has not announced plans to proactively
    monitor this wave of summaries. “I hate that this is the new reality, but it would
    likely take a significant and recurring PR nightmare for a change in policy to
    occur at Amazon,” Friedman says.

  zh: 直到一位作者真正对这一新一代摘要的创作者提起诉讼，它们的合法性仍然是一个悬而未决的问题。尽管亚马逊确实撤下了米切尔的摘要，但它并没有宣布计划主动监控这一波摘要。“我讨厌这是新的现实，但亚马逊要改变政策可能需要一个重大且反复发生的公关噩梦，”弗里德曼说。

    a new summary and uploading it tomorrow. “It’s ridiculous that Amazon doesn’t

    doesn’t seem to know quite how to handle this, either. Mitchell remembers the
    resigned way her agent responded when she wrote to her about the AI imitation:
