    gather data, form hypotheses, and then collect more data to find out which hypothesis
    is correct. That’s the idea, anyway. In practice, real-life science is messy and
    often opaque. Data can be ambiguous. Scientists can be bull-headed. The process
    of shifting consensus has always been as much about politics and intellectual
    fashion as about theory and data. Now throw in social media, fanboy culture, preprint
    archives, and virality — you have a world that breeds all kinds of oddities that
    can pop up, disappear, and reemerge like quantum virtual particles. All sorts
    of wild discoveries are bouncing around the information ecosystem before any peer-reviewed
    journals are able to sort out whether they’re real. And scientists aren’t even
    all on the same page as to whether this is a good thing or not.

    [hyping](https://x.com/alexkaplan0/status/1684044616528453633?s=20) the work of
    a South Korean team that said it had [discovered](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.12008)
    a material that was superconductive at room temperature and pressure. Bolstering
    the claim was a video showing a chunk of material [partially levitating](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/03/science/lk-99-superconductor-ambient.html?unlocked_article_code=CTdKxDBuq6kEimW9V4bT7GMl6VyBNjdtJQP8U_okg82y-oQb1vMh5PACQVm4YrwPNFJjf9uo28U44rlYDk5--Z4vjmms31cyHUcOOJ-ksFGi-7Pc0aqhup-XfbsCU2wff1qhnVndl9LsKxioJmqloSjNQXBaT2-rnnbpy7KCXc-sh56H4Sci_QGaGvETdWBupFpRkxvyOk66c4Qq7goKedkUA_PYIeeWHWNAmxjHqywJEc3D_LWES6IJ_tmGHTpl2RuAaDg5Q7Y3_OBWOPRbimK6t50j_APClPsTb5D-h8g0SktkOl3TkeWszJy9vFoXDNrCw8NyHoiWS7e6iKPlkpJoCA&smid=url-share).
    As we reported [at the time](https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2023/08/is-the-lk-99-superconductor-too-good-to-be-true.html),
    if the findings were replicated, it would have massive practical implications
    for things like levitating trains and quantum computing.

    try to replicate the study, they found that the material — a crystal of copper,
    lead, and phosphate called LK-99 — appeared to not be a superconductor after all;
    its strange magnetic effects were probably caused by a more mundane phenomenon
    called diamagnetism. “Many things are diamagnetic: plastics, graphite, humans,”
    says Leslie Schoop, a professor of chemistry at Princeton. “There is a famous
    experiment where they made a [frog float](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlJsVqc0ywM)
    over a giant magnet.” Within a week, the story faded.'

    with a similar material, called copper-substituted lead apatite, that had a similar
    chemical formulation to LK-99\. This month they [released a paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00999)
    onto the preprint server arXiv in which they reported that while it didn’t superconduct
    at room temperature, it showed evidence of doing so at temperatures that could
    be achieved by a normal household freezer, which itself would be a huge breakthrough.
    Twitter was abuzz once again.

    superconductor,” [wrote](https://twitter.com/pronounced_kyle/status/1742588127628361809)
    Christian Keil in an X post that garnered 4.1 million views. “It’s more like ‘room
    temperature’ than room temperature, the paper says 250K which is -10 F or -23
    C. That’s still HUGE IF TRUE.”

    the reappearance of extraordinary claims about LK-99\. Peter Armitage, a professor
    of physics at Johns Hopkins, says there is no reason to think that these materials
    show any promise. “The chance that they have found something to do with superconductivity
    is almost zero. Based on prior knowledge, I would expect that house lint would
    have the same likelihood to be a high-temperature superconductor as LK-99,” he
    says. “The original motivation was flawed, the experimental work was sloppy, and
    upon inspection the prior data showed no evidence for superconductivity at all. So
    why would we expect anything interesting to occur in this class of compounds?
    I think this work should be just completely ignored.”

    is pretty obviously nothing,” says Schoop. “There is no good reason to suspect
    that this class of materials has any promise for high-temperature superconductivity
    based on the data I’ve seen.”

    Sinéad Griffin, a theoretical physicist at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.
    “It seems to be two independent teams that came together and had similar results.
    My experimental friends say their work is good quality. The one thing is that
    it needs to go through peer review and to be replicated.”

    pan out, Griffin responds: “I almost sound like a crazy person when I answer this,
    but I think it is a superconductor. I just say that it’s very, very hard to synthesize.”'

    the field remains full of unanswered questions. At very low temperatures, within
    a few degrees of absolute zero, the phenomenon of superconductivity is fairly
    well understood. According to quantum physics, electrons can merge together into
    a kind of distributed mutual identity called a Cooper pair. This shared identity
    can connect countless quadrillions of electrons into a single entity, which can
    carry a current without any loss of energy. Something similar must occur in higher-temperature
    superconductors as well, but no one has yet come up with a theoretical mechanism
    to explain it. That means it’s not yet possible to create a superconducting material
    from first principles the way, for instance, a drug company might try to create
    a medicine by building a molecule that will work in a known biochemical pathway.

    previously predicted. And sometimes, the mechanism for superconductivity is completely
    different from our previous understanding,” says Schoop.

    which were discovered in the ’80s. To this day the mechanism by which they work
    isn’t well understood. “People thought there was an upper limit for the temperature
    at which superconductivity can appear, and then copper-oxide ceramics blew through
    this by a lot,” Schoop says. “So we can never rule out that a room-temperature,
    ambient-pressure superconductor can be found, but we don’t have very good ideas
    where to look for it.” There is at present no theoretical upper limit on the temperature
    at which a solid can be superconductive.

    work posted onto arXiv and the like, others feel that the sheer speed with which
    new discoveries can spread make preprint servers worth the occasional annoyance.
    “There is a problem with overhyping things that are not peer reviewed,” says Griffin.
    “But there are severe issues with peer review as well. My longest peer-review
    process was two and a half years. So we just can’t rely on peer review to make
    rapid progress whatsoever.”

    one or more materials exist that will superconduct at room temperature and pressure,
    but the only way that anyone will find them is through a combination of patience,
    perseverance and luck. That means that one day a research team from some little-known
    corner of the world may very well publish a report on a preprint server claiming
    to have made a world-changing discovery—and it will turn out to be true.
