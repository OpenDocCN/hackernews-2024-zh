    of the year, and it''s a longstanding tradition that Intel and AMD announce their
    newest wares there, followed by every OEM''s device announcements. Normally, these
    new chips and devices are a little bit faster than their predecessors, and those
    improvements add up over a five-year upgrade cycle.'

    Ultra, which include a neural processing unit (NPU) and big GPU improvements.
    These chips are optimized for on-device AI tasks, and while Qualcomm made a splash
    with its Snapdragon X Elite last year, Intel has two key advantages: It has tons
    of software partners, and it''s shipping now.'

    Elite is still worth waiting for. The company allowed me to bring a Core Ultra
    laptop and benchmark it next to a Snapdragon X Elite reference design. Naturally,
    I've reviewed both the [Acer Swift Go 14](https://www.xda-developers.com/acer-swift-go-14-2024-review/)
    and the [HP Spectre x360 14](https://www.xda-developers.com/hp-spectre-x360-14-2024-review/),
    and Intel had just handed off an Asus Zenbook 14 to me, so I've had experience
    with the Core Ultra chips already. But how do the two chips compare?

    reference designs. The first time was at the Snapdragon Summit in October, and
    at the time, [I tested it](https://www.xda-developers.com/snapdragon-x-elite-benchmarks/)
    against Apple's M2, Intel 13th Gen CPUs, and Qualcomm's previous generation, the
    Snapdragon 8cx Gen 3\. At the time, Qualcomm actually had two models, one with
    a 23W system TDP and another with an 80W system TDP. However, at CES, it only
    brought along the 80W models, which frankly didn't seem fair. Naturally, we'll
    also include those scores from the 23W machines here.

- en: What's interesting is that when I first wrote about Snapdragon X Elite benchmarks,
    I said that Qualcomm was well-positioned by being far enough ahead of Intel 13th
    Gen that Meteor Lake probably wouldn't catch up, but Intel Core Ultra actually
    got a lower score on single-threaded performance. Intel admits this, too, as it
    sacrificed that single-core performance for better multi-core.

    real-world CPU usage. It's another CPU test, although Cinebench 2024 now comes
    with a GPU test. You do need dedicated graphics to run it.

- en: Both of the Intel single-core scores were 100, so the two Snapdragon machines
    beat them by 24% and 32%. Qualcomm's multi-core performance really blows away
    the competition, thanks to the 12 powerful cores in the Snapdragon X Elite. The
    Core Ultra 7 155H is designed differently, of course, using Intel's hybrid technology
    for six big cores and eight little cores. Single-core performance is about even
    with the rest, but Snapdragon just blows it away in multi-core.

    Interestingly, the Asus Zenbook 14 and HP Spectre x360 came in at 33.28 and 34.12FPS,
    well over 10FPS less than the 80W Snapdragon X Elite unit and 5FPS less than the
    23W model.

    shipping today and that everything works on it. Qualcomm's new custom Oryon silicon
    in the Snapdragon X Elite comfortably defeats Intel Core Ultra in almost every
    benchmark test, while the M2 in Apple's current MacBook Air sits right in the
    middle.

    arrive around June this year. Whichever chip you're waiting for, we knew it would
    be a big year for computers, and 2024 is certainly off to a big start.
