- en: Researchers from Amsterdam UMC and Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam (VU) have discovered
    that the persistent fatigue in patients with long-COVID has a biological cause,
    namely mitochondria in muscle cells that produce less energy than in healthy patients.
    The results of the study were published today in Nature Communications.

- en: 25 long-COVID patients and 21 healthy control participants participated in the
    study. They were asked to cycle for fifteen minutes. This cycling test caused
    a long-term worsening of symptoms in people with long-COVID, called post-exertional
    malaise (PEM). Extreme fatigue occurs after physical, cognitive, or emotional
    exertion beyond an unknown, individual threshold. The researchers looked at the
    blood and muscle tissue 1 week before the cycling test and 1 day after the test.

- en: '"We saw various abnormalities in the muscle tissue of the patients. At the
    cellular level, we saw that the mitochondria of the muscle, also known as the
    energy factories of the cell, function less well and that they produce less energy,"
    says Rob Wüst, Assistant Professor at Department of Human Movement Sciences at
    the VU University. "So, the cause of the fatigue is really biological. The brain
    needs energy to think. Muscles need energy to move. This discovery means we can
    now start to research an appropriate treatment for those with long-COVID," adds
    van Vugt.'

- en: One of the theories about long-COVID is that coronavirus particles may remain
    in the body of people who have had the coronavirus. "We don't see any indications
    of this in the muscles at the moment," says Van Vugt. The researchers also saw
    that the heart and lungs functioned well in the patients. This means that the
    long-lasting effect on patient's fitness is not caused by abnormalities in the
    heart or lungs.

- en: Exercising is not always good for patients with long-COVID. "In concrete terms,
    we advise these patients to guard their physical limits and not to exceed them.
    Think of light exertion that does not lead to worsening of the complaints. Walking
    is good, or riding an electric bike, to maintain some physical condition. Keep
    in mind that every patient has a different limit," says Brent Appelman, researcher
    at Amsterdam UMC. "Because symptoms can worsen after physical exertion, some classic
    forms of rehabilitation and physiotherapy are counterproductive for the recovery
    of these patients," van Vugt adds.

- en: Although the majority of people infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus recover within
    weeks, a subgroup, estimated to be around one in eight, will get long-COVID. Symptoms
    in patients with long-COVID, post-acute sequelae or COVID or post-COVID syndrome
    (PCS) include severe cognitive problems (brain fog), fatigue, exercise intolerance,
    autonomic dysregulation, postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS), orthostatic
    intolerance, and worsening of symptoms after PEM.
