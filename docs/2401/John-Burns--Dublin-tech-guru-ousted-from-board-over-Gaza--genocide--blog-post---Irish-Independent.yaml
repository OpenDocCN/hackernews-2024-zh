- en: A second Irish tech entrepreneur has lost his job over social-media posts about
    the Israel-Hamas conflict. Paul Biggar, a Dubliner now based in New York, has
    been dropped from the board of CircleCI, the software-developing company he founded.
    I Can’t Sleep was the title of a blog Biggar posted on December 15, in which he
    claimed the tech industry was complicit in “genocide” in Gaza, and effectively
    called for a boycott of “investors who whitewash genocide”, citing the likes of
    Sequoia Capital.

- en: 'Jim Rose, ceo of CircleCI, responded by pointing out on social media that “Paul
    does not speak on behalf of” the San Francisco-based company, which he declared
    was “committed to our customers in Israel and around the world”. Soon afterwards,
    however, Rose posted: “Effective December 22, Paul Biggar is no longer a director
    at CircleCI. We thank him for his contributions on the board and wish him the
    best for what’s next.”'
