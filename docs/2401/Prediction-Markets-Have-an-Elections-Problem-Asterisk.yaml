    profiling them — see, for example, Bloomberg’s Matt Levine linking to a market
    on why Sam Altman was fired from OpenAI — and paying attention to what they have
    to say. Advocates claim that by providing a marketplace for bets on uncertain
    events, prediction markets give predictors a financial incentive to be correct.
    If you want a good estimate of what will happen, prediction markets filter signal
    from noise and cut past pundits with no skin in the game. Money talks and bullshit
    walks, and prediction markets force people to put that money where their mouth
    is.

    formally ratified Joe Biden as their winner. In a more normal scenario those markets
    would have shot to 99% or 100% once every media outlet called the relevant states

    In the aftermath of Biden’s victory, Donald Trump quickly declared that large-scale
    election fraud had taken place. He pursued a variety of legal challenges to the
    official results, and, if polls are accurate, convinced something like a third
    of the country that the official results were fraudulent. Although there was never
    any real evidence or rational case for mass-scale election fraud, perhaps the
    market believed that Trump’s legal challenges had a ~10% chance of succeeding
    and was pricing in that outcome. Call this the “rational chance of overturning”

- en: Unfortunately, that theory falls flat in the face of other evidence. Consider
    the “Electoral College Margin of Victory” market for the presidential election
    on PredictIt, a prominent prediction market. This market was designed to predict
    the margin of victory in the Electoral College — Biden wins by 30–59 electors,
    Trump wins by 10–29 electors, etc. A rational theory pricing in a 10% chance that
    Trump’s legal challenges would succeed would see that 10% distributed among the
    likely outcomes, such as a narrow Trump victory by a small number of electoral
    votes. But instead, the majority of the bettors against Biden bet on the astonishing
    outcome of “Trump wins by 280+ electoral votes.” That, it should be clear, was
    impossible — it would require results to be overturned not just in states with
    tight races but also in Democratic bellwethers like California. The Trump campaign
    did not have active legal challenges in enough states to even consider this a
    possibility. And yet the bulk of prediction market betting on Trump was betting
    on a 280+ margin, with prices as high as 9 cents late in November.

- en: Other signs of irrationality also existed in the 2020 election prediction markets.
    Sports betting sites are essentially a more legal form of real-money prediction
    markets, and sometimes venture into political betting. The sports book MyBookie
    listed Trump as a slight favorite to win the presidency overall, giving him implied
    odds of 53% to win re-election. But on that same site, Biden was a significant
    favorite in every swing state — 69% to win Wisconsin, 66% to win Pennsylvania,
    60% to win Arizona. In a rational market, the national odds should reflect the
    aggregation of state-level odds, or else there would be free arbitrage available.
    But that arbitrage persisted — state odds were continuously out of tune with national
    odds.

    in political prediction markets, it’s far from the only example. Academic interest
    in prediction markets has increased since 2016, and that research has repeatedly
    found evidence of inefficiency and irrationality in political prediction markets.
    One study found that betting markets for the 2016 EU referendum in the U.K. were
    inefficient in absorbing new information. Other researchers have found that both
    the 2016 and 2020 U.S. presidential elections had large and persistent arbitrage
    opportunities in their prediction markets — a classic sign of inefficient markets.

    were still in their relative infancy. They may also equivocate about the strange

    factor and difficult to account for. But even in the 2022 U.S. midterm elections,

    forecast. The election forecasts from FiveThirtyEight’s famed election model were
    more accurate than prediction markets from Manifold Markets, Polymarket, Election
    Betting Odds, and PredictIt. The only site to surpass FiveThirtyEight was Metaculus,
    which is not a prediction market — it aggregates expert predictions but without
    the buying or selling of shares that are the signature feature of markets. The
    two best predictors of the 2022 midterm results were the two sites least reliant
    on betting and market mechanisms and most reliant on specialist expertise. The
    loss to FiveThirtyEight is particularly embarrassing for prediction markets because
    FiveThirtyEight’s predictions were public and widely shared for months before
    the election. Prediction markets could have simply copied those odds, since they
    were proven to be well-calibrated. In deviating from the public predictions from
    FiveThirtyEight, prediction markets added negative value.

    odds. Questions about the legality of some prediction markets may scare away bettors;
    some markets allay that fear by using only fake money, but that introduces a new

    Commission, which regulates derivative markets (under which event-based contract

    Kalshi 在政治竞选中提供真实货币赌注的许可。而且一些政治预测市场的参与费用比更一般的投注网站更高。

  zh: 现实世界的市场更加复杂。它们依赖于各种集体规范、执行机制以及其他特征才能发挥作用。它们可能因为摩擦力（如费用或税收）、信息不完全、进入壁垒、心理或文化因素等而失衡。为了简化一个可能比我们应该的复杂主题更多的东西：只有当聪明的资金可以排挤愚蠢的资金时，市场才能发挥作用。愚蠢的资金在某种程度上总是存在的，但是对于尖端交易者对抗不那么精明的交易者的财务激励通常足以让市场有效地运行并达到高效或接近高效的结果。
- en: But smart money driving out dumb money isn’t an automatic process. There are
    a variety of reasons why it might not happen, including technical barriers to
    market entry, regulation, or cultural factors. Even in extremely deep, liquid,
    and mainstream financial markets the process isn’t automatic. The rise of meme
    stocks such as GameStop (GME) and Bed Bath & Beyond (BBBY) show that if dumb money
    is large enough and enthusiastic enough, it’s difficult for smart money to overwhelm
    it and get a stock back to its “correct” price. BBBY stock maintained a market
    cap of around $60 million for months after the company filed for bankruptcy. Dumb-money
    demand for BBBY stock was so strong that BBBY actually got special permission
    to sell more stock — of an already bankrupt company! — and sold millions of dollars
    of it to willing buyers. The market cap remained at $62 million until the literal
    day the stock was delisted as their bankruptcy was finalized with zero value going
    to stockholders.

  zh: 但智慧资金挤出愚蠢资金并非一种自动过程。导致这种过程不会发生的原因有很多，包括市场进入的技术障碍、监管或文化因素。即使在非常深度、流动性强、主流的金融市场中，这个过程也不是自动的。像GameStop（GME）和Bed
    Bath & Beyond（BBBY）这样的迷因股票的崛起表明，如果愚蠢资金足够庞大且充满热情，智慧资金很难压倒它，并将股票价格恢复到“正确”的水平。BBBY股票在公司破产申请后的几个月内仍然保持着约6000万美元的市值。对BBBY股票的愚蠢需求非常强烈，以至于BBBY实际上获得了特别许可，可以出售更多股票——这是一家已经破产的公司！——并将数百万美元的股票出售给愿意购买的人。直到股票被摘牌之日，其市值仍然保持在6200万美元，因为随着破产程序的完成，股东们毫无价值地离开。
- en: This process of smart money driving out dumb money is even harder in prediction
    markets. There’s strong evidence that prediction markets have a huge amount of
    unsophisticated, identity-based bettors. And there’s very little evidence of the
    opposite — financial juggernauts throwing around their weight. Where are the hedge
    funds making an easy buck? Billionaire financiers routinely make massive bets
    on stocks, bonds, and currencies — where are the billionaires taking huge positions
    on prediction markets? That kind of institutional smart money doesn’t exist in
    political prediction markets the way it does in traditional financial markets.
    With so much dumb money and so little smart money, is it any surprise that we
    get outcomes dictated by trolls instead of professional traders?

  zh: 智慧资金挤出愚蠢资金的过程在预测市场中更加困难。有强有力的证据表明，预测市场上有大量缺乏经验的、基于身份的投注者。相反的证据非常少见——金融巨头们施展威力的迹象寥寥可见。那些轻而易举赚大钱的对冲基金在哪里？亿万富翁金融家们经常在股票、债券和货币上进行大额投注——在预测市场上哪些亿万富翁占据了大额头寸？这种机构智慧资金在政治预测市场上并不存在，就像在传统金融市场上那样存在。在这么多愚蠢资金和如此少的智慧资金的情况下，难道我们会因为受到巨魔而不是专业交易者的结果而感到意外吗？
- en: Prediction markets as a tool are still in their relative infancy. They show
    great promise, but the results from political prediction markets should give us
    pause. These markets are demonstrably inefficient, biased in predictable ways
    based on political identities, and can’t outperform expert analysis even when
    they have public access to that expert analysis. This isn’t a reason to abandon
    prediction markets. Like any tool, prediction markets can be used, abused, or
    misused, and one failure doesn’t doom the concept.

  zh: 作为一种工具，预测市场仍处于相对初期阶段。它们显示出巨大的潜力，但政治预测市场的结果应该让我们停下脚步。这些市场明显效率低下，受政治身份影响的偏见可预测，甚至在公开获得专家分析的情况下也无法胜过专家分析。这并不是放弃预测市场的理由。与任何工具一样，预测市场可以被使用、滥用或误用，一个失败并不意味着概念注定要失败。
- en: But it does show that we need to take seriously the structures that make markets
    work when designing prediction markets. We can see the same dynamics from previous
    political markets playing out in the markets for the 2024 presidential election — candidates
    like Robert Kennedy Jr., Vivek Ramaswamy, and Gavin Newsom (who hasn’t even declared
    he’s running) all have odds that seem unrealistically high. Prediction markets
    that deal with other highly charged subjects — for instance, a market on the outcome
    of a war, or a market on urban crime statistics — will likely be subject to some
    of the same factors that distort political prediction markets. Unless we make
    sure that market structures are providing the right incentives in the right way,
    we shouldn’t be surprised if prediction markets continue to struggle.

  zh: 但这确实表明，我们在设计预测市场时需要认真对待使市场运作的结构。我们可以看到，之前政治市场上出现的同样动态也出现在2024年总统选举市场上——像罗伯特·肯尼迪·朱尼尔、维韦克·拉马斯瓦米和加文·纽森（甚至还没有宣布参选）这样的候选人的胜率似乎不切实际地高。处理其他高度争议性主题的预测市场——例如战争结果市场或城市犯罪统计市场——可能会受到扭曲政治预测市场的一些相同因素的影响。除非我们确保市场结构以正确的方式提供正确的激励，否则如果预测市场继续挣扎，我们就不应该感到惊讶。
