- en: You are much closer to sleeping on the streets than sleeping in the mansion
    of a billionaire. And the envious desire to sleep in the mansion of the billionaire
    is what is destroying our environment. We have allowed the greedy and cruel to
    dominate and their insatiable greed and cruelty will inevitably lead to environmental
    destruction.

- en: Billionaires are responsible for a million times more greenhouse gas emissions
    than the average person. Twenty Big Tech companies rule the world, while every
    year, 125 ultra-wealthy individuals generate the equivalent greenhouse gas emissions
    of 85 million cars. 77 million people are responsible for more climate-changing
    emissions than the poorest five billion, while the ultra-elites are emitting 77
    times more CO2 than is compatible with a 1.5°C warming limit. By 2019, the top
    1% in the US were responsible for more emissions than the poorest 50%, while the
    world’s top 1% of belchers produce over 1000 times more CO2 than the bottom 1%.
    The top 1% elite each belch 110 tons of CO2 a year while the poorest 50%, just
    1.5 tons. Between 1995 and 2021, the wealthiest 1% captured 38% of total wealth
    growth while the bottom 50% captured only 2.3%. The top 1% elite pocket two-thirds
    of all new wealth. If the richest 10% of the world were forced to cut their CO2
    levels to that of the European Union mean level, a 32% reduction in global CO2
    emissions could be achieved.

    while the average resident of Nigeria has the same carbon footprint as a US fridge.
    An average person living in sub-Saharan Africa emits about 0.6 tons of CO2 per
    year, while an average person living in the USA emits 14.5 tons. In order to prevent
    more than 1.5°C of global heating, our average emissions should be no greater
    than two tons of CO2 per person per year. Just 1% of the world’s population earns
    more than $58,000 per year, while an annual salary of $19,300 makes you part of
    the global richest 10%.

    32,000 tons. Billionaires are Machiavellian, psychopathic, and narcissistic, according
    to psychological research. They are malevolent self-promoters, emotionally cold,
    nonstop liars and highly aggressive. They love private jets, whose sales reached
    their highest ever level ever in 2023\. Private jets numbers have more than doubled
    in two decades.

- en: The United States of America only includes 5% of the world’s population, while
    accounting for more than a quarter of environmental damage. The richest 10% from
    the USA produce 56.5 tons of CO2 per person per year, which is more than double
    the emissions of the richest 10% in Europe, and almost double that of the richest
    10% of Chinese. The USA is the world’s all-time greatest emitter and destroyer
    of environments. The USA is responsible for 40% of the climate breakdown. The
    European Union is responsible for 29%. The Global North is responsible for 92%
    of excess global carbon emissions.

- en: The poorest 50% of people cause only 12% of CO2 but will experience 75% of relative
    income loss due to climate change, while owning just 2% of world wealth. Meanwhile,
    the top 10% belch 48% of total CO2, own 76% of everything, and will experience
    only 3% of relative income loss due to the destruction they cause. Why are we
    allowing the greedy and cruel destroy our environment?

- en: Global energy consumption is almost three times higher than the energy that
    would be required to meet basic needs for all. Separating the energy of frivolous
    wants from the energy of genuine need is what we must do. Are we going to drive
    two-ton SUVs to the apocalypse, while smoking vapes and making TikTok videos?
    The super-rich global 1% consume as much energy as would provide a decent living
    to 1.7 billion. If the middle class gave up their frivolous wants, five billion
    people could live dignified, sustainable lives.

    privileged enough to be reading this then you—like me—are currently part of the
    problem, not the solution. What’s the solution? A massive reduction in consumption
    by rich and middle-class people and the establishment of a fair living standard
    for all within the context of a sustainable environment.
