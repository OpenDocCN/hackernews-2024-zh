- en: The mirror test was developed by psychologist Gordon Gallup Jr.¹ in 1970 as
    a method for determining whether a non-human animal has the ability of self-recognition.
    It’s also known as the “mark test” or “mirror self-recognition test” (MSR).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When conducting the mirror test, scientists place a visual marking on an animal’s
    body, usually with scentless paints, dyes, or stickers. They then observe what
    happens when the marked animal is placed in front of a mirror. The researchers
    compare the animal’s reaction to other times when the animal saw itself in the
    mirror without any markings on its body.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Animals that pass the mirror test will typically adjust their positions so that
    they can get a better look at the new mark on their body, and may even touch it
    or try to remove it. They usually pay much more attention to the part of their
    body that bears a new marking.

    if an animal doesn’t pass the test, they may still have interesting reactions

  prefs: []

    cases, it might be that the animal mistakes its reflection for another of its
    kind. This can lead to some [amusing sights](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kG_QhttG6jo)

    their reflections in mirrors, and [will respond to colored markings placed in-view
    on their bodies](https://www.animalcognition.org/2015/03/22/asian-elephants-recognize-their-reflections/).
    However, not all of the elephants in a study² by Joshua M. Plotnik passed. This
    might be because the normal behavior of elephants conflicts with what passing
    the mirror test requires.  “
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The mark test can be difficult to apply across species because it assumes that
    a particular animal will be interested in something weird on their body. Primates
    are interested in such things—we’re groomers. But elephants are different. They’re
    huge and they’re used to putting things *on,* not taking things off of their bodies,
    like mud and dirt.” said Plotnik.³

    chimpanzees, orangutans, and gorillas have all passed the mirror test.^(4,1,5 )However,
    it isn’t uncommon for many individuals to fail, especially if they are particularly

    75% of young adults.^(6 )This percentage lowers with individuals closer to either

- en: Many gorillas have failed the mirror test. When shown a mirror, a number of
    silverbacks have exhibited aggressive behavior. It has been speculated that most
    of the gorillas and other primates who do not pass the test may have inhibited
    behavior due to the presence of observing humans.
  prefs: []

    that prevented them from exhibiting behaviours indicative of self-recognition
    in the test situation.”⁷

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Additionally, gorillas will often avoid eye contact with their reflection. By
    avoiding eye contact, gorillas are likely not able to look at their reflection
    long enough to realize that it is themselves who they are seeing. Koko the gorilla,
    well known for having learned sign language and performing well in other cognitive
    experiments, was the first of her species to pass the test.

    is indeed of themselves.

    When contrasting colored stickers were placed on their feathers, the magpies reacted
    to their reflections by trying to remove the mark. Birds who were marked with
    invisible stickers showed no altered behavior.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Prior to this experiment, scientists believed that self-recognition abilities
    came from the neocortex, a part of the brain found only in mammals. Since magpies
    are birds, they do not have this part of the brain. Magpies passing the mirror
    test shows that the ability of self-recognition can arise from different brain
    parts in other types of brains. It’s a case of “convergent evolution”. This happens
    when similar abilities, behaviors, and traits independently evolve in species
    that are not closely related.

    didn’t divert from their normal behaviors.

    and touch the mirror. They’d retreat and re-approach the mirror. Sometimes they
    would groom themselves.

    wouldn’t touch the markings. But this changed when they could see their reflections
    in a mirror. The ants with blue dots on their face would groom and appear to try
    to remove the markings.

    of their face didn’t clean themselves. Interestingly, neither did ants with blue
    dots put on the back of their heads.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When put in the company of those with blue-dotted faces, other ants would respond
    aggressively, presumably because the difference caused them to think the blue-dotted
    ant was an outsider (not a member of their colony).  All of this lead the researchers
    to conclude that the clypeus is a species-specific physical characteristic that
    is important for group acceptance.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Given that these ants tried to clean the mark rather than respond aggressively, the
    ants likely didn’t think their reflection was just another ant. The team thinks
    their study shows that self-recognition is not an “unrealistic” ability in ants.

    Csilla Ari to suspect that they might be the fish species most likely to pass
    the mirror test.^(12, 13) When she [exposed captive manta rays to a large mirror](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gINpG8Zc8hg),
    they showed great interest in their reflections.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The rays would repeatedly swim in front of the mirror, turning over to show
    their undersides and moving their fins. When in front of the mirror, they even
    blew bubbles, an unusual behavior. What the rays didn’t do is try to socially
    interact with the mirror image.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: All of this suggests that the rays might recognize it’s themselves they’re seeing
    in the mirror, not another ray. However, a classic mirror test using marks on
    the rays’ bodies has yet to be done. If rays can pass a mark test, it’s a more
    solid indication of self-recognition abilities. The presence of exploratory behavior
    and a lack of social behavior doesn’t automatically indicate self-recognition.

- en: Conclusion
  prefs:
  - PREF_H4
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If an animal can pass the mirror test, it’s certainly strong evidence of self-recognition,
    and indicates the possibility of self-awareness (i.e. a “sense of self”). However,
    it’s not definitive proof. And if an animal isn’t able to pass, that doesn’t necessarily
    mean that they do not possess these abilities.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For example, animals that rely on other senses more heavily than their vision
    may not take much interest in the sight of their reflections. Dogs, who recognize
    others mainly by their sense of smell, might quickly conclude that their mirror
    image is not of themselves or any other animal, because it lacks a corresponding
    scent. Furthermore, some animals may be able to recognize themselves in the mirror
    and see that they have been marked, but do not find the mark important enough
    to warrant touching or inspection.
