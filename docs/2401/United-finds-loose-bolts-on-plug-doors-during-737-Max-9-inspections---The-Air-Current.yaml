- en: United Airlines has found loose bolts and other parts on 737 Max 9 plug doors
    as it inspects its fleet of Boeing jets following the Friday rapid depressurization
    aboard an Alaska Airlines jet of the same make, according to three people familiar
    with the findings.

    A spokeswoman for the Federal Aviation Administration declined to comment on the
    United findings, and pointed to the agency’s [earlier statements](https://www.faa.gov/newsroom/updates-grounding-boeing-737-max-9-aircraft).

    inspections on Saturday, we have found instances that appear to relate to installation
    issues in the door plug – for example, bolts that needed additional tightening.
    These findings will be remedied by our Tech Ops team to safely return the aircraft
    to service.”

    the fall-out from the grounding, intensifying the focus on Boeing and Spirit AeroSystems.
    The pair together is responsible for the assembly, installation and quality checks
    of the aircraft structure.

    doors on its grounded jets. “As our maintenance technicians began preparing our
    737-9 Max fleet for inspections, they accessed the area in question. Initial reports
    from our technicians indicate some loose hardware was visible on some aircraft,”
    the [company wrote](https://news.alaskaair.com/alaska-airlines/operations/as-1282/).

- en: Across the five United aircraft, there is little consistency in the locations
    of the errant parts, according to documents reviewed by *The Air Current.* In
    one instance, United found that the bolts that affix the lower hinge of the plug
    door were not fully seated, and that the washers on the bolts could “spin”.

- en: Another aircraft was found to have loose bolts on the upper forward guide fitting
    on the plug and another on the forward guide roller that is an attachment point
    to the fuselage on the door frame. Additionally, screws that are part of the lower
    hinge bracket at the bottom of the plug on another aircraft were found to not
    be fully screwed in.

    2023, according to ch-aviation, and would likely not have been through a heavy
    maintenance C check that occurs every 4,000 to 6,000 hours or two to three years.

    Message (MOM) to 737 Max 9 operators, prescribing the specific inspection criteria
    that would satisfy the [emergency airworthiness directive](https://theaircurrent.com/feed/dispatches/faa-orders-temporary-grounding-of-boeing-737-max-9-fleet/)

    that before inspections could begin, the FAA would need to approve operators’
    inspection processes to ensure compliance, and that the airline would need to
    develop detailed inspection instructions and processes for its maintenance technicians
    to follow. Alaska said that it canceled roughly 140 flights for Monday due to
    the 737 Max 9 grounding.
