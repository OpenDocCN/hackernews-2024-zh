    stolen designs are being put to the test as a jury trial brought against the search
    giant by Singular Computing kicks off this week.

- en: Google is accused of infringing patents held by Singular and developed by computer
    scientist Joseph Bates, an academic turned startup founder. According to his LinkedIn
    [profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/joebatessingular/), Bates held research
    and teaching positions at Cornell, MIT, Carnegie Mellon, and Johns Hopkins universities
    in the US between 1980 until 2011.

    architectures. According to Singular's [website](https://www.singularcomputing.com/),
    the biz "develops and licenses hardware and software technologies for high-performance
    energy-efficient computing, both large scale and embedded."

    lawsuit in a Massachusetts federal court against the cloud titan [[PDF](https://regmedia.co.uk/2024/01/09/singular_google_complaint.pdf)].
    According to the complaint, Bates disclosed various technologies he had come up
    with to Google under a non-disclosure agreement on three occasions between 2010
    and 2014\. During this time, Singular said, Bates made Google aware the technologies
    in question were patent protected.

- en: The patents, said to have been first filed in 2009 and made public in 2010,
    describe a computer architecture designed to execute a large number of low-precision
    calculations each processor cycle. While this lower precision may be impractical
    for conventional compute workloads, the complaint argues it's well suited to AI
    software that can accommodate this lower precision.

- en: 'Singular Computing also emphasized that these technologies don''t just exist
    on paper, as a prototype based on the designs was constructed shortly after the
    first patent application was filed. The patents in question are: an initial US
    [8,407,273](https://patents.google.com/patent/US8407273B2), and US [9,218,156](https://patents.google.com/patent/US9218156B2)

    its TPU v2 and v3 processors, without permission or a license, and thus knowingly
    infringed the associated patents. TPUs being the custom AI accelerator chips Google
    designed [with outside help](https://www.theregister.com/2023/09/22/google_broadcom_tpus/)
    to use in its cloud to speed up the training of neural networks and their decision
    making.

    designs could be "really well suited" for the web goliath's workloads, according
    to internal emails surfaced by the complaint. Google's legal team, meanwhile,
    argued no one who worked on the TPUs had any connection with Bates or his blueprints.

    statement to *The Register*, a spokesperson said: "Singular''s patent claims are
    dubious and currently on appeal. They don''t apply to our Tensor Processing Units,
    which we developed independently over many years. We look forward to setting the
    record straight in court."'

    heard this week in which Google will present arguments as to why Singular's patents
    should be considered invalid. Big G is essentially trying to get the patents thrown
    out to crash Singular's infringement complaint.

    filed by Google, Singular is seeking between $1.6 billion and $5.19 billion in
    damages in the form of a lump sum payment if the jury determines the company's
    patents were infringed. ®
