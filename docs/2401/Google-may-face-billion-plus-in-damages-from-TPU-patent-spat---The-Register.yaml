    scientist Joseph Bates, an academic turned startup founder. According to his LinkedIn
    [profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/joebatessingular/), Bates held research
    and teaching positions at Cornell, MIT, Carnegie Mellon, and Johns Hopkins universities

  zh: 谷歌被指控侵犯了由Singular持有、由计算机科学家Joseph Bates开发的专利，后者是一位学术界转型为初创企业创始人。根据他的领英[资料](https://www.linkedin.com/in/joebatessingular/)，Bates在1980年至2011年间在美国的康奈尔大学、麻省理工学院、卡内基梅隆大学和约翰霍普金斯大学担任研究和教学职位。
- en: In 2005, Bates founded Singular Computing to commercialize various computing
    architectures. According to Singular's [website](https://www.singularcomputing.com/),
    the biz "develops and licenses hardware and software technologies for high-performance
    energy-efficient computing, both large scale and embedded."

    lawsuit in a Massachusetts federal court against the cloud titan [[PDF](https://regmedia.co.uk/2024/01/09/singular_google_complaint.pdf)].
    According to the complaint, Bates disclosed various technologies he had come up
    with to Google under a non-disclosure agreement on three occasions between 2010
    and 2014\. During this time, Singular said, Bates made Google aware the technologies
    in question were patent protected.

  zh: Singular与谷歌的法律纠纷可以追溯到2019年底，当时Bates在马萨诸塞州的一个联邦法院对云巨头提起了诉讼[[PDF](https://regmedia.co.uk/2024/01/09/singular_google_complaint.pdf)]。根据投诉，Bates在2010年至2014年间三次根据保密协议向谷歌披露了他提出的各种技术。在此期间，Singular表示，Bates让谷歌知道了涉及的技术是受专利保护的。
- en: The patents, said to have been first filed in 2009 and made public in 2010,
    describe a computer architecture designed to execute a large number of low-precision
    calculations each processor cycle. While this lower precision may be impractical
    for conventional compute workloads, the complaint argues it's well suited to AI
    software that can accommodate this lower precision.

  zh: 所谓的专利据称首次于2009年提交，并于2010年公开，描述了一种设计用于每个处理器周期执行大量低精度计算的计算机架构。投诉称，虽然这种低精度对于传统的计算工作负载可能不实用，但它非常适合可以适应这种低精度的人工智能软件。
- en: 'Singular Computing also emphasized that these technologies don''t just exist
    on paper, as a prototype based on the designs was constructed shortly after the
    first patent application was filed. The patents in question are: an initial US

    its TPU v2 and v3 processors, without permission or a license, and thus knowingly
    infringed the associated patents. TPUs being the custom AI accelerator chips Google
    designed [with outside help](https://www.theregister.com/2023/09/22/google_broadcom_tpus/)

    designs could be "really well suited" for the web goliath's workloads, according
    to internal emails surfaced by the complaint. Google's legal team, meanwhile,
    argued no one who worked on the TPUs had any connection with Bates or his blueprints.
