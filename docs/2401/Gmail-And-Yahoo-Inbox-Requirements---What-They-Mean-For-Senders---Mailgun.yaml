    they will be enforcing new protection standards for bulk email senders.

    [explained in a statement](https://blog.google/products/gmail/gmail-security-authentication-spam-protection/)
    that **enforcement will begin in February 2024**, and they’ll be carefully monitoring
    bulk senders (those transmitting more than 5000 messages a day). In a very similar
    announcement, [Yahoo explained](https://blog.postmaster.yahooinc.com/post/730172167494483968/more-secure-less-spam)
    that they’ll also be targeting the first quarter of 2024.

    providers enforce in recent years, but they’re not new. In fact, authentication,
    one-click unsubscribe, and spam monitoring have been high on the list of [email
    deliverability best practices](/blog/email/understanding-email-deliverability/)
    for quite some time now.

    you’ll need to get serious about certain email deliverability best practices.

    volumes of 5000 or more messages to Gmail addresses in one day. The announcements
    don’t specify that a sender must send 5000 messages *each* day, or within a certain
    time frame, though. So, **it’s important to consider your peak holiday sending
    habits, and large campaigns when checking if these rules will apply to you.**
    *You* may not think of yourself as a bulk sender, but mailbox providers might
    disagree.

    changes in the way we should be sending emails, but they’re still not followed
    by many senders. For example, email authentication has been strongly encouraged
    for a number of years now. Still, our [State of email deliverability report](/resources/research/state-of-deliverability-2023/)
    found that around 40% of senders are either unsure or not implementing both SPF
    and DKIM, and among those using DMARC, 40% are not sure what their policy is.

    and encryption. The purpose is to protect your identity against spoofing and protect
    your recipients from phishing attacks. This is why t**he Gmail and Yahoo updates
    focus on validating your sender identity**. [In 2022,](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/6010255)

    resulted in a [75% drop in unauthenticated messages](https://blog.google/products/gmail/gmail-security-authentication-spam-protection/)

    following these [best practices.](https://support.google.com/a/answer/174124)
    The requirement from both Gmail and Yahoo is to set up strong authentication with
    “ SPF, DKIM, and DMARC for your domain.” Previously not a requirement, this move
    towards implementing Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance,
    (DMARC) is something Sinch Mailgun’s Jonathan Torres had already predicted in
    our guide on email security and compliance.
  prefs: []

    that have DMARC policies set to reject or quarantine, because those are the ones
    they can verify and trust. We haven’t seen anyone take that step yet, but the
    groundwork is there to require senders to have a DMARC policy set to something
    besides p=none. That might be what it takes for adoption.”

    preferences and providing feedback. Senders will have two days to implement unsubscribe
    requests.
