- en: On Friday, Microsoft disclosed that the hacking group it calls Midnight Blizzard,
    also known as [APT29](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0016/) or Cozy Bear — and
    widely believed to be sponsored by the Russian government — hacked some corporate
    email accounts, including those of the company’s “senior leadership team and employees
    in our cybersecurity, legal, and other functions.”

- en: Curiously, the hackers didn’t go after customer data or the traditional corporate
    information they may have normally gone after. They wanted to know more about
    themselves, or more specifically, they wanted to know what Microsoft knows about
    them, according to the company.

    information related to Midnight Blizzard itself,” the company wrote [in a blog

    brute forcing — against a legacy account, then used that account’s permissions
    “to access a very small percentage of Microsoft corporate email accounts.”

    We will act immediately to apply our current security standards to Microsoft-owned
    legacy systems and internal business processes, even when these changes might
    cause disruption to existing business processes,” the company wrote. “This will
    likely cause some level of disruption while we adapt to this new reality, but
    this is a necessary step, and only the first of several we will be taking to embrace
    this philosophy.”
