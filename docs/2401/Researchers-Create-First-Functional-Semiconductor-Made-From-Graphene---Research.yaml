- en: Epitaxial graphene could cause a paradigm shift in the field of electronics
    and allow for completely new technologies that take advantage of its unique properties.
    The material allows the quantum mechanical wave properties of electrons to be
    utilized, which is a requirement for quantum computing.

    and the rest was just making it happen," de Heer said. "We had to learn how to
    treat the material, how to make it better and better, and finally how to measure
    the properties. That took a very, very long time."'

- en: According to de Heer, it is not unusual to see yet another generation of electronics
    on its way. Before silicon, there were vacuum tubes, and before that, there were
    wires and telegraphs. Silicon is one of many steps in the history of electronics,
    and the next step could be graphene.

    plane that could fly 300 feet through the air. But the skeptics asked why the
    world would need flight when it already had fast trains and boats. But they persisted,
    and it was the beginning of a technology that can take people across oceans."'

- en: The Georgia Institute of Technology, or Georgia Tech, is one of the top public
    research universities in the U.S., developing leaders who advance technology and
    improve the human condition. The Institute offers business, computing, design,
    engineering, liberal arts, and sciences degrees. Its more than 45,000 undergraduate
    and graduate students, representing 50 states and more than 148 countries, study
    at the main campus in Atlanta, at campuses in France and China, and through distance
    and online learning. As a leading technological university, Georgia Tech is an
    engine of economic development for Georgia, the Southeast, and the nation, conducting
    more than $1 billion in research annually for government, industry, and society.
