- en: The free-software community has managed to build a body of software that is
    worth, by most estimates, many billions of dollars; all of this code is freely
    available to anybody who wants to use or modify it. It is an unparalleled example
    of independent actors working cooperatively on a common resource. Free software
    is certainly a success story, but all is not perfect. One of the community's greatest
    strengths — convincing companies to contribute to this common resource — is also
    part of one of its biggest weaknesses.

- en: The GNU project, as described by Richard Stallman in the 1985 [GNU Manifesto](https://www.gnu.org/gnu/manifesto.en.html),
    looked hopelessly ambitious at the time. To many of us, it seemed that only large
    companies could build operating systems, and that a group of volunteers would
    never be able to aspire to such a goal. The volunteers got surprisingly far, to
    the point that, less than ten years after the GNU Manifesto was published, running
    a system on only free software (or something close to that) was possible. It was
    an impressive achievement.

    The X Window System, for example, was the product of a commercial consortium that
    predated Linux. The development of GCC was pushed forward by companies like Cygnus
    Computing. When the Linux kernel arrived on the scene, there was indeed a substantial
    body of GNU software that could run on it, but there was a nontrivial amount of
    company-contributed software as well.

    ways, even though it was better in others. That began to change with the arrival
    of corporate funding, which supercharged development on Linux and on free software
    in general. Without it, we would not have the system we take for granted today.
    Companies, working in their own interest, have built up our body of free software
    hugely; it is almost as if this capitalism thing actually works.

- en: The problem, of course, is that these companies have a tendency to interpret
    their own self-interest rather narrowly. They will happily pay to develop a driver
    for a hardware product, but they are less interested in supporting the maintainership
    and review that are needed to integrate that driver, the development of the subsystem
    into which the driver fits, or the support the driver will need over the years.
    Companies pay for thousands of developers to work on the kernel, but none pays
    for a single technical writer to create documentation. Work that is not seen as
    contributing to short-term revenue tends not to get much attention in the corporate
    world.

    in the open-source community. These include license violations, free-riding, throwing
    code over the wall, and more. Projects that are controlled by a single company
    are often particularly problematic. These difficulties have often been covered
    elsewhere; today the focus is on the failure to support parts of the community
    that we all depend on.

    about the lack of testing infrastructure for the kernel, calling it a failure
    of leadership. Greg Kroah-Hartman, instead, [said that the problem lies elsewhere](/ml/linux-kernel/2024011532-mortician-region-8302@gregkh/):
    "<q>No, they fall into the ''no company wants to pay someone to do the work''
    category, so it doesn''t get done.</q>" He pointed out that there is not much
    the leadership (such as it is in the kernel community) can do in a situation like
    this. So testing infrastructure for the kernel tends to languish.'

    [apologized](https://social.kernel.org/notice/Ae0x6yb73Oinx4WznE) for a lack of

    time into that work. He later [clarified](https://social.kernel.org/notice/Ae2y1fgYQjHQ7R1xDc)
    that post: "<q>it just means that we haven''t properly reallocated resources to

    few years has seen that b4 has transformed the maintainer's task in many ways.
    It must have paid back the effort that went into its development many times over.
    The kernel community has never put the effort into tooling that it needs; the
    advent of b4 was a change in that pattern and one that we would all like to see
    continue.

- en: One can easily criticize the Linux Foundation (LF) for not supporting this work
    at the level that we would like. But the fact of the matter is that the LF is
    about the only entity that has supported this work *at all*; without that support,
    we would not have b4\. So, while encouraging the LF to more strongly support b4
    is a good thing to do, it is also worth asking why no other company has seen fit
    to support that work, despite the fact that they have all benefited from it. The
    incentives that drive companies (and their managers) simply leave little room
    for this kind of work, even though the benefits from it would be real and immediate.

    Leap 16](https://news.opensuse.org/2024/01/15/clear-course-is-set-for-os-leap/)
    distribution has led to [fears](/ml/opensuse-factory/9B42BF3F-2D93-4FCF-A479-DE292AC9F989@opensuse.org/)
    that this version of the distribution will not support packages like KDE or Thunderbird
    — fears that are arguably getting ahead of the game, since they have not yet been
    confirmed by SUSE. Such a move would seem similar to Red Hat's [decision to drop
    LibreOffice](/Articles/933525/) from Red Hat Enterprise Linux. Support from companies
    for the Linux desktop, it seems, is threatened.

    KDE Plasma 5 was so big that they couldn't make the jump for RHEL 8, it was also
    because people were not paying for RHEL for the desktop, so they had no budget
    for more people. It happened again with the layoffs at Red Hat last year. SUSE
    is no different. And Ubuntu? Canonical already did their big layoff in 2017 where
    they laid off hundreds of staff related to the desktop.

    just happens to benefit all of us, even if we are not directly paying for it.
    But, seemingly, that path toward making money is more elusive in the desktop realm;
    those of us who are using desktop Linux are not generally paying for the privilege,
    and neither is anybody else. So the resources going into desktop development are
    reduced, and Linux desktop users will feel the effects of that.

    a failure to support the ecosystem they depend on can have results, but only to
    a point. Organizations like the LF can organize resources toward the solution
    of common problems, but they have to please the same companies that are paying
    their bills in the end. Governments can help to fund areas that the market has
    passed over; that path gets harder in the absence of a functioning government,
    which is the situation to varying degrees in many parts of the world at the moment.

    depending on volunteers to do the work in areas that companies decline to fund.
    That can be successful, but often at a high cost to the people who are doing that
    work. Depending on volunteers is not an inclusive approach; there are a lot of
    people who do not have the luxury of giving many hours of their time to this kind
    of project. Progress in that world will be slow.

    interesting to see what we come up with.
