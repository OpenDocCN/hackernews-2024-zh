  zh: 更新：美国国家劳工关系局已经决定，Google的承包商仍然是其员工，因此Google拒绝与他们选择的工会谈判违反了美国劳动法。

- en: Cognizant contractors on the YouTube team voted to join the Alphabet Workers
    Union-Communication Workers of America (AWU-CWA) last April. Shortly after, the
    AWU accused Google and Cognizant of refusing to bargain with it on behalf of the

  zh: YouTube团队的Cognizant承包商去年四月投票加入Alphabet Workers Union-Communication Workers of
    America（AWU-CWA）。不久之后，AWU指责Google和Cognizant拒绝代表YouTube合同工人与其进行谈判。
- en: According to the NLRB panel, Google openly admits to refusing to bargain with
    the Union because it, along with Cognizant "contest the validity of the union's
    certification" based on the pair's position "that Cognizant and Google are *not*

- en: If Google refuses to comply with the NLRB order the board won't have much way
    to penalize it, at least not for now. Per the judges, a "compensatory remedy"
    was requested, but the board severed the issue for future consideration since
    fining Google for its actions would require reviewing prior case law and "outlining
    a methodological framework for calculating such a remedy."

    remaining team members went through and won their vote to join the AWU-CWA in

    We''ve long had many contracts with unionized suppliers," Mencini told us last

    last year that it and Cognizant met the terms of joint employment, but its latest
