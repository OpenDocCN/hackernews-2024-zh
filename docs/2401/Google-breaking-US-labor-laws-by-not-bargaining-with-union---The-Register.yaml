- en: Updated The US National Labor Relations Board has decided that Google's contractors
    are still its employees, thus Google is violating US labor laws by refusing to
    bargain with their chosen union.

- en: A three-judge NLRB panel reached that conclusion in a [case](https://www.nlrb.gov/case/16-CA-326027)
    between Google and a group of contract staffers working with Google's YouTube
    team who were hired through staffing firm Cognizant.

- en: Cognizant contractors on the YouTube team voted to join the Alphabet Workers
    Union-Communication Workers of America (AWU-CWA) last April. Shortly after, the
    AWU accused Google and Cognizant of refusing to bargain with it on behalf of the
    YouTube contract workers.

- en: According to the NLRB panel, Google openly admits to refusing to bargain with
    the Union because it, along with Cognizant "contest the validity of the union's
    certification" based on the pair's position "that Cognizant and Google are *not*
    joint employers."

- en: The NLRB has concluded otherwise that "Cognizant and Google have codetermined
    the essential terms and conditions of employment [for the YouTube team] and have
    been joint employers" at all material times.

    Labor Relations] [Act](https://www.nlrb.gov/guidance/key-reference-materials/national-labor-relations-act),"

    in collective bargaining."'

- en: If Google refuses to comply with the NLRB order the board won't have much way
    to penalize it, at least not for now. Per the judges, a "compensatory remedy"
    was requested, but the board severed the issue for future consideration since
    fining Google for its actions would require reviewing prior case law and "outlining
    a methodological framework for calculating such a remedy."

    and working to train Bard were allegedly fired after attempting to unionize, but
    remaining team members went through and won their vote to join the AWU-CWA in
    November. Mencini had a largely identical script prepared for us when we spoke
    after the NLRB decided Google and Accenture were joint employers despite Google's
    claims to the contrary.

    We''ve long had many contracts with unionized suppliers," Mencini told us last
    year. "However, as we made clear in our active appeal to the NLRB, we are not
    a joint employer as we simply do not control their employment terms or working
    conditions."'

    last year that it and Cognizant met the terms of joint employment, but its latest
    appeal means the matter is headed for the federal court system. There, the matter
    could have wide-ranging implications for the future of contract labor law. ®

    breaking labor law and infringing on our rights as workers to freely organize
    and bargain for fair working conditions," Katie-Marie Marschner, subject matter
    expert at YouTube Music and member of the Alphabet Workers Union-CWA, told *The

    NLRB determining that Alphabet significantly shapes our working conditions and
    is in fact our employer, the company has refused to meet us at the bargaining
    table. Google and Cognizant have proceeded to make unilateral changes to our working
    conditions such as a forced return to office, removal of sick pay during a global
    pandemic, and the implementation of a ''Clean Room'' policy that bars us from
    having our phones, paper, or pens in our office, without bargaining with our union.'

    with the union and pad the pockets of shareholders and executives. Alphabet and
