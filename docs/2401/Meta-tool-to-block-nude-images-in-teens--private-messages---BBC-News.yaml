    encryption (e2ee) has been [fiercely criticised by government](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-66854622),
    police and leading children's charities.

    undermines the chief privacy protecting feature of encryption, that only the sender

    on device, the BBC understands. According to Meta, using machine learning to identify
    child abuse is much harder and there would be a serious risk of errors if this
