### What we do

At Doctor Droid, we are building tooling in the observability & monitoring category. Our product enables engineers to speed up their on-call investigations. Currently, we are in the beta. We are a fast moving company and have built multiple products to support engineering teams' critical pain points:

*   [On-Call Assistant](https://drdroid.io): Speed up on-call troubleshooting and investigations by leveraging past knowledge
*   [Kenobi](https://drdroid.io/kenobi): A Platform designed for real-time analytics and alerting
*   [Alert Audit Report](https://drdroid.io/doctor-droid-slack-integration): Understand the noise and quality of alerts in your critical slack channels

### Vision

Think if anyone in the team can debug an average production issue without requiring to involve a senior engineer (or a team of engineers?). Wouldn't that be wonderful? That's what we are working towards.

### Funding

To work towards our vision, we couldn’t have been more grateful for having some amazing investors. We are lucky enough to be supported by Accel and we were part of Y-Combinator’s W23 batch.
