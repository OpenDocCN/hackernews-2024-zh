    landscape,” the company is still making cuts. This is a common refrain in the

- en: Prime Video aside, all of these organizations at Amazon — Twitch, MGM Studios
    and Audible — came to the company via acquisition. Most recently, Amazon spent
    [$8.5 billion](https://techcrunch.com/2022/03/17/amazon-completes-its-8-5-billion-acquisition-of-mgm/)
    on MGM in 2022, which brought more than 4,000 films and 17,000 TV shows to the
    Prime Video streaming service. Twitch, the gaming-focused livestream platform,
    came to Amazon for about [$1 billion](https://techcrunch.com/2014/08/25/amazon-will-buy-twitch-for-over-1-billion/)
    in 2014\. [Audible](https://techcrunch.com/2008/01/31/amazon-strengthens-its-digital-hand-with-300-million-purchase-of-audible/)

  zh: 除了 Prime Video 外，亚马逊旗下的这些机构 — Twitch、MGM Studios 和 Audible — 都是通过收购而来的。最近，亚马逊在
    2022 年斥资 [$85 亿美元](https://techcrunch.com/2022/03/17/amazon-completes-its-8-5-billion-acquisition-of-mgm/)
    收购了 MGM，为 Prime Video 流媒体服务带来了 4,000 多部电影和 17,000 多个电视节目。游戏直播平台 Twitch 于 2014
    年以约 [$10 亿美元](https://techcrunch.com/2014/08/25/amazon-will-buy-twitch-for-over-1-billion/)
    的价格被亚马逊收购。[Audible](https://techcrunch.com/2008/01/31/amazon-strengthens-its-digital-hand-with-300-million-purchase-of-audible/)
    自 2008 年以 $3 亿美元的价格被亚马逊收购。
- en: Twitch is massively popular, but the costs of operating a huge livestreaming
    service are high, so the company has remained unprofitable. For MGM and Prime
    Video, senior vice president Mike Hopkins said the division is making cuts to
    “reduce or discontinue investments in certain areas while increasing our investment
    and focus on content and product initiatives that deliver the most impact.”
