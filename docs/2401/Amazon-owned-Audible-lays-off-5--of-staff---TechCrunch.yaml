- en: Audible, the Amazon-owned audiobook company, is laying off 5% of its staff,

- en: Per the memo, Audible CEO Bob Carrigan praised staff for a strong 2023 and assured
    them that the business was in good shape… but, due to the “increasingly challenging
    landscape,” the company is still making cuts. This is a common refrain in the
    tech sphere, where companies across all sectors have been beleaguered by [ongoing
    layoffs](https://techcrunch.com/2024/01/09/tech-layoffs-2023-list/) since 2022.

    Across the company, in 2023, Amazon [laid off](https://techcrunch.com/2023/03/20/amazon-confirms-another-round-of-layoffs-impacting-9000-people-in-aws-twitch-and-other-units/)
    [around](https://techcrunch.com/2023/01/05/amazon-to-cut-18000-jobs-as-tech-layoffs-continue/)
    27,000 employees across multiple departments, including AWS, Twitch and advertising.
    Now, just this week, Twitch laid off another [500 employees](https://techcrunch.com/2024/01/09/twitch-layoff-500-employees/),
    and Amazon’s MGM Studios and Prime Video let go of “[several hundred](https://techcrunch.com/2024/01/10/amazon-prime-video-and-mgm-studios-laid-off-hundreds-of-employees/)”
    employees. It’s an ominous time for Amazon’s entertainment products.

    and Audible — came to the company via acquisition. Most recently, Amazon spent
    [$8.5 billion](https://techcrunch.com/2022/03/17/amazon-completes-its-8-5-billion-acquisition-of-mgm/)
    on MGM in 2022, which brought more than 4,000 films and 17,000 TV shows to the
    Prime Video streaming service. Twitch, the gaming-focused livestream platform,
    came to Amazon for about [$1 billion](https://techcrunch.com/2014/08/25/amazon-will-buy-twitch-for-over-1-billion/)
    in 2014\. [Audible](https://techcrunch.com/2008/01/31/amazon-strengthens-its-digital-hand-with-300-million-purchase-of-audible/)
    has been part of Amazon since 2008, when it was acquired for $300 million.

- en: Twitch is massively popular, but the costs of operating a huge livestreaming
    service are high, so the company has remained unprofitable. For MGM and Prime
    Video, senior vice president Mike Hopkins said the division is making cuts to
    “reduce or discontinue investments in certain areas while increasing our investment
    and focus on content and product initiatives that deliver the most impact.”
