- en: After a rough couple of years where all models of Raspberry Pi (except the Pico
    microcontroller) were in short supply, it's now relatively easy to find most SKUs
    in stock. However, the new Raspberry Pi 5 can still be a slight challenge; at
    press time, it was sold out at the authorized U.S. retailers but in stock at the
    UK outlets.

  zh: 在过去的几年里，除了 Pico 微控制器之外，所有型号的树莓派都供不应求，现在大多数 SKU 都比较容易找到库存。然而，新的树莓派 5 仍然可能有些挑战；截至报道时，美国授权零售商已售罄，但英国零售商有库存。
- en: That's all about to change as Raspberry Pi Ltd is currently producing 70,000
    Raspberry Pi 5 boards a week with plans to scale up to as many as 90,000 units
    per week in the near future.

  zh: 树莓派有望发生翻天覆地的变化，因为树莓派有限公司目前每周生产 70,000 块树莓派 5 主板，计划在不久的将来扩大规模，达到每周高达 90,000 块。
- en: Raspberry Pi CEO Eben Upton shared the promising news with us, along with the
    picture above, which he says he took during a recent factory visit. It shows dozens
    of panels filled with completed Raspberry Pi 5 boards that are about to be tested
    and packed for shipping. Each panel in the picture (shown uncropped below) contains
    nine individual Pi boards.

- en: '"Uplift to 90ku is mostly due to bringing more test heads online in the auto
    test pods," Upton told us. "[Sony](https://www.tomshardware.com/tag/sony) really
    are quite remarkable."'

  zh: “90ku 的提升主要是通过在线自动测试架中添加更多测试头来实现的，”厄普顿告诉我们。“索尼确实非常了不起。”
- en: Sony runs the factory in Pencoed, Wales where Raspberry Pi boards are manufactured.
    Upton noted that the process is highly automated, with everything from the testing
    to the packing being done by machine.

- en: The CEO said he didn't have a precise number of Pi 4 boards produced weekly
    to share with us, but estimated that it was about the same as the Pi 5\. He also
    promised that Raspberry Pi would maintain its aggressive manufacturing pace until
     "backlogs are fulfilled and the channel (Approved Resellers and others) is in
    a good stock position."

  zh: CEO 表示，他没有精确的每周生产 Pi 4 主板数量与我们分享，但估计与 Pi 5 差不多。他还承诺，树莓派将保持其积极的制造速度，直到“积压订单得到满足，渠道（授权经销商和其他人）库存充足”。
- en: At publishing time, Raspberry Pi 4 boards were widely in stock at all the U.S.
    and UK outlets we checked. However, given that the Pi 5 models with 4GB and 8GB
    of RAM cost only $5 more than their Pi 4 equivalents, most individual makers would
    be right to prefer the new model.

  zh: 在发布时，我们检查了所有美国和英国零售商，发现树莓派 4 主板普遍有库存。然而，考虑到具有 4GB 和 8GB 内存的 Pi 5 型号仅比其 Pi 4
    对等型号贵 $5，大多数个人制作者可能更愿意选择新型号。

    the ability to connect M.2 SSDs, dual camera ports and more. Who wouldn't want
    those benefits for their next [Raspberry Pi project](https://www.tomshardware.com/features/best-raspberry-pi-projects)?

- en: However, companies that are using Pi 4 either within products or for [enterprise](https://www.tomshardware.com/tag/enterprise)
    use cases may want to buy more of the older board, because the Pi 5 isn't a drop-in
    replacement. It requires new chassis, a higher-wattage power supply and (in most
    use cases) an active cooler.

  zh: 但是，正在使用 Pi 4 的公司，无论是在产品内部使用还是用于[企业](https://www.tomshardware.com/tag/enterprise)案例，可能会想购买更多的旧板，因为
    Pi 5 并不是直接替换品。 它需要新的机箱，更高功率的电源以及（在大多数情况下）一个主动式冷却器。
