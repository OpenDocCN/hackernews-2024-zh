- en: After a rough couple of years where all models of Raspberry Pi (except the Pico
    microcontroller) were in short supply, it's now relatively easy to find most SKUs
    in stock. However, the new Raspberry Pi 5 can still be a slight challenge; at
    press time, it was sold out at the authorized U.S. retailers but in stock at the
    UK outlets.

    Raspberry Pi 5 boards a week with plans to scale up to as many as 90,000 units
    per week in the near future.

    picture above, which he says he took during a recent factory visit. It shows dozens
    of panels filled with completed Raspberry Pi 5 boards that are about to be tested
    and packed for shipping. Each panel in the picture (shown uncropped below) contains
    nine individual Pi boards.

    test pods," Upton told us. "[Sony](https://www.tomshardware.com/tag/sony) really
    are quite remarkable."'

    Upton noted that the process is highly automated, with everything from the testing
    to the packing being done by machine.

- en: The CEO said he didn't have a precise number of Pi 4 boards produced weekly
    to share with us, but estimated that it was about the same as the Pi 5\. He also
    promised that Raspberry Pi would maintain its aggressive manufacturing pace until
     "backlogs are fulfilled and the channel (Approved Resellers and others) is in
    a good stock position."

- en: At publishing time, Raspberry Pi 4 boards were widely in stock at all the U.S.
    and UK outlets we checked. However, given that the Pi 5 models with 4GB and 8GB
    of RAM cost only $5 more than their Pi 4 equivalents, most individual makers would
    be right to prefer the new model.

    the ability to connect M.2 SSDs, dual camera ports and more. Who wouldn't want
    those benefits for their next [Raspberry Pi project](https://www.tomshardware.com/features/best-raspberry-pi-projects)?

- en: However, companies that are using Pi 4 either within products or for [enterprise](https://www.tomshardware.com/tag/enterprise)
    use cases may want to buy more of the older board, because the Pi 5 isn't a drop-in
    replacement. It requires new chassis, a higher-wattage power supply and (in most
    use cases) an active cooler.
