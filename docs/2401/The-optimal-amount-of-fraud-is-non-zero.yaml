    [transcript](https://www.npr.org/transcripts/1119606931)) regarding a particular
    form of credit card fraud. One comment which tragically ended on the cutting room
    floor: "the optimal amount of fraud is greater than zero."'

    you click a button and some statistic in your civilization moves radically in
    response. In real life, cause and effect is more subtle, but this relationship
    exists, and there are (both historically and at this very moment) legal regimes
    which are radically different than your status quo, and which achieve(d) very
    different outcomes as a direct consequence of policy decisions.
  prefs: []

    (you could simply agree something was not a crime anymore and bam, crime down)
    and, more interestingly, because crime responds directly to things which are within
    your control. Most of the world has taken most of the easy policy choices which
    have few tradeoffs available! But there are still arbitrarily severe options to
    control crime from where you are, from “increase the police budget” to “ban alcohol
    totally” to “implement an Orwellian dystopia.”

    the enforcement efforts of non-state actors. A commanding majority of all fraud
    which is stopped, detected, adjudicated, and even punished (!) gets those done
    to it by one or more private sector actors. And the private sector has, in this
    case, policy decisions to make, which, like the public sector’s decisions, balance
    the undesirability of fraud against the desirability of social goods such as an
    open society, easy access to services, and (not least!) making money.

    to one particular type of fraud against one particular type of actor: the bad

    valuable goods or services from a business. This is an extremely common fraud,
    costing the world something like $10 to $20 billion a year, and yet it is actually
    fairly constrained relative to all types of fraud.'

- en: Liability for payments fraud happens in a waterfall, established by a combination
    of regulation, contracts, and business practice. The specifics get complicated
    but, for ability to concretely visualize this, consider the case of consumer credit
    card users in the United States.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You might assume that, if a credit card is stolen/hacked and used by a bad actor
    to buy something, the cardholder would be liable. They will suffer the first loss,
    certainly, but society has decided by regulation (specifically, [Regulation E](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/rules-policy/regulations/1005/))
    that that loss should flow to their financial institution, less a $50 I-can’t-believe-it’s-not-deductible.
    As a marketing decision, the U.S. financial industry virtually universally waives
    that $50.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The card issuer will, following the credit card brand’s rules (which developed
    in symbiosis with regulation), automatically seek recovery of the loss from the
    business’s payments processor. It will, similarly, automatically seek recovery
    of the loss from the business itself.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In the overwhelming majority of cases, that is where the waterfall ends. While
    insurance is available (both specialized chargeback insurance and general business
    insurance), overwhelmingly businesses simply absorb fraud costs in the same way
    that they absorb their office rent, staff salaries, and marketing expenses.
  prefs: []

    to it, in the ordinary course of business. This allocation of loss is mostly automatic,
    virtually never involves a court or lawyer, and only sometimes takes human effort
    at the margin at all.

    available to them impact the user experience of *fraudsters* *and legitimate users

    against the ease for legitimate users to transact.

    has a fundamental limitation in that all humans can be trivially killed while
    sleeping. Huge portions of society’s efforts go toward establishing conditions

    with different people having different levels of trust in different situations.
    To increase trust generally tends to frontload the cost to generate that trust,
    and decrease transactional friction afterwards. You trust your accountant more
    than most regular employees, you trust your employees more than your customers,
    you trust your customers more than a person you’ve never met, etc.

    you (the business) need to identify and interview several prospective accountants
    and employ one winner for years, and you (the accountant) need to have spent years
    of your life to get a professional credential and then to have worked your entire
    career to demonstrate yourself worthy of trust. This is one reason why accountants
    are routinely trusted with the holiest-of-holies secrets of companies and governments.

    ones is quickly bootstrapping a business over the decision to trust someone they’ve
    never met, enough to allow them to consume valuable goods and services, based
    on nothing more than a promise of future payment.

    marketing to make you think that a payment is more than a promise. It’s a lie,

    model to run the world under than the truth is.

    citation hopefully not needed. They have a choice as to how much friction they
    want that new customer to need to go through prior to being offered goods and

    more new customers, who spend more, and who stick around for more transactions.

    underwriting process, in part to increase your trust in them / decrease your perception
    of the risk that they would defraud you. You could, for example, ask them to give
    you a firm handshake as a condition of doing business.
  prefs: []

    The requirement that it happen face-to-face decreases the number of international
    professionalized fraud gangs which can target you, because they’re not physically
    close enough to shake your hand. Unfortunately, for the same reason, it also decreases
    how many customers you can sell to; most people don’t live within commuting distance
    of your retail presence.

    you might not have recognized it as such. Ever been asked for billing address
    in addition to shipping address? That’s for AVS verification. There is an obvious
    user-experience hit there, and it’s quantifiable; removing fields from checkout

    term-of-art describing the percentage of prospects who successfully purchase something.)

    One major reason is that it gives customers a history that allows a business to
    direct more of its anti-fraud attention to (more risky) first-time users than
    (less risky) multi-year regular customers. Allowing guest checkouts is a business
    decision to accept more fraud (and less ability to market to the customer) in
    return for marginal sales.

    for all users. For example, you could imagine asking the purchasers of especially
    high-risk orders to first confirm possession of a phone number (via typing in
    a code you text them), or even to talk to a human in your fraud department before
    completing the transaction. Both of these are aimed at breaking the economics
    of scaled fraud; phone numbers and voice calls are expensive relative to synthetic
    identities and tend to leak information about fraud operations, which can further
    inform defenses.

    their own fat margins.

    than businesses with low margins. Consider businesses which sell IP, like video
    game companies, streaming services, or SaaS. Because their margins are often 90%+,
    if you were to present them with a menu of strategies which traded off conversion
    rate and fraud rate, they’d maximize for conversion rates until fraud at the margin
    reached levels not seen in even the most corrupt places imaginable.

    Apple hardware or game consoles, have to be *much* more careful about who they

    transaction screening on, they screen more marginal orders. They accept painful
    tradeoffs like, “We’ll have a fraud department review every new order and hold
    every first-time order for shipping until we can talk to the purchaser.”

    a good thing. Society gets to make choices, and here it is choosing through the
    activities of private agents. It is optimizing for how many resources to let leak
    to bad actors and much societal effort to burn on policing them versus how much
    low-friction commerce to enable by good actors. This is often missed in discussions
    of fraud; one reason it has increased over the past few decades is that legitimate
    commerce has *exploded*, as the world becomes richer and as barriers to commerce

    Generally speaking, it will be private actors applying their own cost-benefits

    maximize for their own interests.
