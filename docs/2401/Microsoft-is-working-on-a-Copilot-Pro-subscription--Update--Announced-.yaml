    its [Copilot](https://www.androidauthority.com/chatgpt-vs-bing-chat-3292126/)
    AI service (formerly Bing Chat) on mobile devices for a while. The service has
    long been free to use, allowing you to speak to a chatbot, generate AI images,
    and more. Now, recent Edge browser updates for Android hint at a so-called Copilot
    Pro option.'

    122.0.2336.0 and version 122.0.2342.0 of the Microsoft Edge Canary app for Android.
    Check out the strings below.

    looks like we’ve got a subscription-based offering in line with [ChatGPT Plus](https://www.androidauthority.com/what-is-chatgpt-plus-3292982/).

    Copilot Pro perks. This includes access to the latest AI models, priority access
    for quicker answers, and “high-quality” image generation.

- en: It’s worth noting that the current free version of Copilot already offers access
    to the latest models and high-quality image generation. So we’re guessing Microsoft
    could hobble the free tier by restricting some of these perks to Copilot Pro in
    the future.

    conversations per day. However, the strings don’t mention any improvements in
    this regard if you upgrade to Copilot Pro.
