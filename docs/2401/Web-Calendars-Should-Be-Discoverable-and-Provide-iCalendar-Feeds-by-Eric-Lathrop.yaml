- en: Many web sites have lists of events, which really form a calendar. Who wants
    to remember to check a bunch of random web sites for calendars? I'd rather subscribe
    to those calendars the same way [I use RSS to subscribe to lists of articles](https://ericlathrop.com/2020/12/rediscovering-rss/)
    to read with [my RSS reader](https://miniflux.app/).

    [iCalendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICalendar) version of their event list.
    One missing piece is autodiscovery. Similar to [RSS autodiscovery](https://www.rssboard.org/rss-autodiscovery),
    I propose we use a `link` tag to provide a way for web browsers and calendar software
    to find iCalendar feeds:'

- en: This would let your browser display a button to import the calendar into your
    machine's configured calendar software. It would also let you paste web page URLs
    into your calendar software, and the software could discover the iCalendar feed
    and import it automatically.
