    who [said](https://www.theverge.com/24054329/microsoft-edge-automatic-chrome-import-data-feature)
    he noticed Edge opening on a system reboot in the same state that Chrome was in
    before the restart. Warren claimed he neither imported Chrome data to Edge nor
    gave it permission to import open browser tabs from Chrome, yet there it was.
    Warren said he never toggled the setting on, and that it was off when he checked.

    other browsers in that update, the issue isn't new - it's well documented in forum
    posts and help requests. We've asked Microsoft for an explanation, and while we're
    told they're looking into it, we have yet to receive an actual response.

    who has visibility into the Windows giant, though who did not want to be identified,
    told us it appears that "if a user chose continuous import in the Edge first run
    experience on some other device, this state may be syncing incorrectly across
    their devices. This is not the intended feature experience." We're assured that
    Microsoft is addressing it for the next Edge Stable release.
