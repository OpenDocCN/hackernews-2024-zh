# Customers discover 'fatal' design flaw in Tesla's $80,000 Cybertruck that could lead to passengers' fingers being CHOPPED OFF - and it's been named the 'guillotine effect' | Daily Mail Online

New owners of [Tesla](/news/tesla/index.html)'s sleek, stainless-steel Cybertruck may want to watch their fingers closing the electric vehicles doors and its front-facing trunk.

Reviewers have conducted a now viral 'carrot test,' and other experiments with hot dogs, bananas, and other food to simulate what would happen to passengers' hands and fingers — discovering a gruesome 'guillotine effect' in the process. 

The $80,000 truck - which has been plagued by manufacturing issues - does not feature anti-pinch sensors like Tesla's own Model X and rival electric trucks like Ford's F-150 Lightning.

'I'm just going to shut the door like a normal person shuts the door. Nothing too hard,' one reviewer said just before gently showing the Cybertruck's driver's side door chop the ends off two large, hearty carrots.

The tests, conducted by the team at Out of Spec reviews (above), showed that many electric vehicles can be risky for people's appendages, and their food products, when caught between the closing tailgate and the body of the vehicle

'You might want to watch your fingers around the Cybertruck,' as TikTok user [@molesrcool](https://www.tiktok.com/@molesrcool/video/7325920426478144811?lang=en) put it. 'You could end up losing them.'  

The tests, conducted by the team at [Out of Spec](https://outofspecstudios.com/) reviews, showed that many electric vehicles can be risky for people's appendages, and their food products, when caught between the closing tailgate and the body of the vehicle.

Chinese smartphone maker Xiaomi is breaking into the electric vehicle market with its new SU7 sedan, scheduled to go on sale in 2024\. CEO Lei Jun announced the car on Thursday. 

But, the same could not be said about other closures, like car doors, truck tailgates, and so-called 'frunks' (front trucks), where Rivian R1T proved to be safest of the current class of EV trucks.

Anti-pinch sensors, and anti-pitch catches have been a increasingly common feature of vehicles since the early 2000s, particularly with automatic windows, making their absence from the Cybertruck unusual.

Infamously, an August 2016 Tesla software update cut out pinch sensor functionality on the Model X's futuristic gull-wing doors, to prevent 'phantom detections.'

'Some Model X owners worried that rear-seat passengers, especially children, could be injured if they get their hands and arms caught between the heavy doors and the body,' as [Automotive News](https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:DVCFGih4M14J:https://www.autonews.com/article/20160905/OEM03/309059950/can-tesla-perfect-its-gull-wing-doors&hl=en&gl=us) noted at the time. 

But what has made the Cybertruck uniquely more dangerous is that, as reviewers have noted, the vehicles stylish steel body lacks a radius on the edges of its panels. 

'Tesla ultimately decided to make the Cybertruck's body panels out of 1.8 mm thick stainless steel sheets, which are not folded over into a hem at the edges,' one tech writer for Notebook Check noted, 'leaving a sharper edge than normal.' 

'When two of these thin, relatively sharp panels come together so closely, they could present trouble for anything that gets in the way.'

'When this front trunk is open you get this basically perfectly cut stainless steel sharp corner and then the trunk does not have proper pinch detection,' TikTok user [@molesrcool](https://www.tiktok.com/@molesrcool/video/7325920426478144811?lang=en) explained in his assessment of the new 'carrot test' video.

Musk handed the first Cybertruck keys to owners on November 30 during livestreamed event [hosted at Tesla's Gigafactory in Austin, Texas](/sciencetech/article-12784009/Tesla-Cybertruck-FINALLY-way-stores-North-America-Elon-Musk-promises.html).

The CEO appeared in good spirits as he watched the steel-plated electric vehicles roll onto a stage before inviting each person to sit in their new truck - despite launching into an expletive-filled outburst aimed at advertisers pulling out of X the day before.

Moments after the live stream ended, Tesla updated its website with new pricing, showing the Cybertuck has nearly doubled in price from $39,999 to $60,990.

The steel-plated vehicle features a six-foot-long, four-foot-wide bed that can carry up to 2,5000 pounds, 11,000 pounds towing capacity and a 17-inch ground clearance.

Musk said the Cybertruck's body is made of a stainless steel alloy developed by Tesla.

Stainless steel, Musk said, has no corrosion and does not need paint but can still be mass-produced.

The starting price was not the only one to increase - all-wheel drive is now $79,990, and the Cyberbeast is $99,990.
