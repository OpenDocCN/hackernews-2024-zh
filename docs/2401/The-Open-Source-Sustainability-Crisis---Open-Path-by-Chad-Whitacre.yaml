    of this post is to define terms. What is Open Source sustainability? Why do I
    say it is in crisis? My answers are that sustainability is when people are getting
    paid *without jumping through hoops*, and we’re in a crisis because people aren’t
    *and they’re burning out*.

    that we have not reached Open Source sustainability yet. We’ve hardly begun. For,
    sustainability means the opportunity to produce Open Source software and get paid
    fairly without jumping through hoops is widely available to many, many people.

    Open Source is designed for a different world. It presents the first real opportunity
    in our society to begin to develop a post-scarcity economic model at scale. That
    likely wants unpacking in [a future post](https://github.com/chadwhitacre/openpath/issues/15).
    For now, I assert that our creative use of [well-trodden paths](https://twitter.com/eigenjoy/status/862412458517962752)
    is Open Source *subsidization*, not *sustainability*.

    Nate’s chart. Self-determined individuals freely produce Open Source software,
    and get paid in proportion to their productivity without having to also become
    tech influencers, or sell contracts, or any other shenanigans. Those can who want
    to. I envision a world where we don’t have to.

    to mind when we think about Open Source in crisis. But, while they draw attention
    to the sustainability crisis, the crisis is not about security. Microsoft pays
    [100,000](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/engineering-at-microsoft/welcome-to-the-engineering-at-microsoft-blog/)
    developers and still has [plenty of security issues](https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability).
    Yes, companies and governments should [care about Open Source security](https://openssf.org/),
    and those efforts can contribute to what I’m calling sustainability, but security
    is a proxy concern. Let’s call that the Open Source security crisis.

    in general. We have not just inequality of outcome but inequality of opportunity.

    of hoops to jump through in order to get paid fairly for producing widely adopted
    Open Source software. We should [directly address this wider diversity crisis](https://www.outreachy.org/),
    and, we should work on resolving the sustainability crisis.'

    on the common pool resource of Open Source software, and this commons is severely
    underprovisioned. How do we know? The real indicator of the Open Source sustainability
    crisis as I define it is **maintainer burnout**.

    and there’s my date picker. But in 15 years, the only money I ever got for that
    was $400 from a guy who needed me to add a specific feature. I think I got a handful
    of change thrown at me through PayPal, like $50 bucks. There was no economic sustainability
    whatsoever.

    contributing to open source. I never built up my GitHub profile when that came
    around. I just gave up, because what’s the point when all you get is constant
    issues? You give and give and give, and people just take and take and take.
