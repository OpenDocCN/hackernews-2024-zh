- en: A new [paper](http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2300582121) released Monday in
    the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences found about 240,000 particles
    in the average liter of bottled water, most of which were “nanoplastics” — particles
    measuring less than one micrometer (less than one-seventieth the width of a human
    hair).
