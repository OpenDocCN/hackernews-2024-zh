    coworker was making more than me during my stint in S&P Capital IQ. I remembered
    casually asking him one day “How much is your salary?”. When I found out it was
    $40,000 more than mine, I felt resentful, jealous, and unappreciated. How could
    someone who had the same job title and the same experience make 40% more than
    me?

    it by the fact I wasn’t even getting paid fairly. I eventually left the company
