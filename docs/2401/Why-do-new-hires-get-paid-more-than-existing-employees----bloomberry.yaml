    coworker was making more than me during my stint in S&P Capital IQ. I remembered
    casually asking him one day “How much is your salary?”. When I found out it was
    $40,000 more than mine, I felt resentful, jealous, and unappreciated. How could
    someone who had the same job title and the same experience make 40% more than
    me?

    it by the fact I wasn’t even getting paid fairly. I eventually left the company
    a few months later. They counter-offered me with a promotion and a salary bump,
    but by then, I felt too offended. The damage was already done.

    disgruntled ? Do they really think employees won’t find out? Or that they’ll stay
    anyway because they’re one of the best employers in the world? As someone who
    spent some time working with compensation teams later in my career, and saw “how
    the sausage was made”, I thought I’d shared some insight into *why* new hires
    get paid more than existing employees, and why the best way to get a bigger pay
    is to move to a new job.

    goals. Heck, some Big Tech companies fire the bottom 10% of their team every year.
    They want people who have been around for a long time, and not pulling their weight
    to leave. So underpaying their current employees fixes this problem, as it will
    ultimately lead to a % of these people leaving every year. Of course the problem
    with this is that this also affects high performers.

    your company can only give 5% maximum raises every year (because it’s tied to
    inflation, cost of living increase, or another metric), your salary will continue
    to lag the market average.

    wanted to give you a large raise to match the market, they wouldn’t have the budget.
    And even if they had the budget, they probably would have a lot of explaining
    to do to their superiors on why they allocated a large part of it to your raise.
