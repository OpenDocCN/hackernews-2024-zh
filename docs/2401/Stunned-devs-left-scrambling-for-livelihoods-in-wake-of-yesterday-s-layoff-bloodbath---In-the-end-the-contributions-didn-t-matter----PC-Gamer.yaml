- en: The entire game industry is still reeling from yesterday's bombshell announcement
    that Microsoft—hot on the heels of its $69 billion acquisition of [Activision](https://www.pcgamer.com/tag/activision-blizzard/)—would
    be laying off 1,900 employees across [Activision-Blizzard and Xbox](https://www.pcgamer.com/microsoft-cuts-1900-jobs-at-activision-blizzard-and-xbox-blizzard-president-mike-ybarra-leaves-the-company-and-the-studios-survival-game-has-been-cancelled/).
    Inevitably, Twitter is awash with reactions highlighting the human cost, both
    from dazed devs waking up in a world in which they no longer have jobs, and from
    others wondering what this all means for the months and years ahead.

  zh: 整个游戏行业仍然因为昨天的Microsoft公司发布的震惊公告而震惊不已，紧随其后的是其对[动视暴雪](https://www.pcgamer.com/tag/activision-blizzard/)69亿美元收购之后，将裁员1900名员工的消息。不可避免地，Twitter上充满了人们对人为代价的反应，一方面是迷惑的开发者们在一个没有工作的世界中醒来，另一方面是其他人在思考这对未来的几个月和几年意味着什么。

    wrote former QA learning specialist Cole McElwain in a [much-retweeted post](https://twitter.com/Bowl_of_Cole/status/1750679961013547437),
    "I finally secure a job at Blizzard. I move to California and am welcomed with

  zh: 前暴雪公司员工的帖子太多了以至于数不胜数。“经过多年的申请，”前质量保证学习专家科尔·麦克尔温在一篇[被广泛转发的帖子中写道](https://twitter.com/Bowl_of_Cole/status/1750679961013547437)，“我终于在暴雪公司获得了一份工作。我搬到了加利福尼亚，被一个令人难以置信的团队欢迎。我对开始工作感到非常激动…

    former senior character artist working on Blizzard's now-cancelled survival game,
    [wrote that](https://twitter.com/you16_0823/status/1750674607915540822) "Blizzard
    was my dream company, but sadly today I got laid off with other incredibly talented
    people," adding that he needed "time to process" events, but had "no time because
    I'm on work visa."

  zh: 其他开发人员陷入了更加不稳定的境地。曾在暴雪公司被取消的生存游戏中担任高级角色艺术家的藤田智郎在[twitter发文说](https://twitter.com/you16_0823/status/1750674607915540822)：“暴雪是我的梦想公司，但很遗憾，今天我和其他一些非常有才华的人一起被解雇了，”他补充说他需要“时间去面对”这些事件，但是“我没时间了，因为我持有工作签证。”
- en: Bafflingly, the devs who learnt they were laid-off relatively early are the
    lucky ones. Per a tweet from Bloomberg's [Jason Schreier](https://twitter.com/jasonschreier/status/1750543289227284649),
    some devs found themselves reaching out to *him*, an unaffiliated reporter, to
    find out if they had kept their jobs or not amidst the chaos.

  zh: 令人困惑的是，早早得知被解雇的开发者是幸运的。根据彭博社的[杰森·施莱尔](https://twitter.com/jasonschreier/status/1750543289227284649)的一条推文，一些开发者发现自己在混乱中向他这个不属于公司的记者求证是否保住了工作。
- en: Even more devs have reflected on the sheer years of experience that have gone
    to waste as the layoffs cut people loose. [Olivia Burk](https://twitter.com/LivBurk/status/1750713444322639980),
    who works at Obsidian and was not part of the Blizzard layoffs but worked at the
    company previously, wrote that "the projects I gave four years of my life to while

    wrote "It was a good run. 12 years at Blizzard and just like that. Deactivated…

    as time wears on and even more layoffs sink their teeth in. Inxile director of
    communications [Micah Whipple](https://twitter.com/micahwhipple/status/1750679482435051536)
    wrote that he started his career in Blizzard tech support, "an entry level job

  zh: 随着时间的推移，越来越多的裁员深入骨髓，一些开发者开始怀疑游戏行业将会变成什么样子。Inxile 传播总监[迈克·惠普尔](https://twitter.com/micahwhipple/status/1750679482435051536)写道，他从暴雪技术支持开始了自己的职业生涯，“这是一个帮助人们在他们的

- en: The sheer brutality and nonsensical nature of the layoffs was hammered home
    yesterday by the *concurrent* headlines announcing that Microsoft—which vies with
    Apple for first place as [most valuable company on Earth](https://www.pcgamer.com/microsoft-rides-the-ai-wave-to-a-dollar29-trillion-market-cap-beating-apple-as-the-most-valuable-corporation-on-earth/)—had

  zh: 昨天的头条同时宣布微软——与苹果争夺地球上最有价值公司的第一名——暂时成为人类历史上第二家市值超过3万亿美元的公司，这进一步突显了裁员的残酷和荒谬性。
- en: 'The notion that a company of this staggering scale had no alternative but to
    cut 1,900 people free of their livelihoods was more than a little hard to swallow,
    and the absurdity was highlighted in a tweet from former Blizzard senior designer
    [Jorge Murillo](https://twitter.com/thehornetsfury/status/1750612652873928949),

  zh: 这家规模庞大的公司别无选择，只能裁掉1,900人的生计，这个观念让人有些难以接受，而这种荒谬更是由前暴雪资深设计师[豪尔赫·穆里略](https://twitter.com/thehornetsfury/status/1750612652873928949)在推特上突出显示，他分享了他在公司
    Slack 中发送的最后一条消息：“看，我只是很高兴我们能够为股东提供一些价值。”
