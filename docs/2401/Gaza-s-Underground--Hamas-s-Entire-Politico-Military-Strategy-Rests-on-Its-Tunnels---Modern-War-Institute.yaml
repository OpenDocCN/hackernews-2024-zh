- en: The use of tunnels in wars is not new. Seeking advantages by using either natural
    or man-made spaces underground is as ancient as warfare itself—from stories of
    tunnels being used to win massive battles [in the bible](https://mwi.westpoint.edu/discovering-jerusalems-hidden-urban-warfare-lessons/)
    to underground spaces becoming key factors to urban battles, like [Mariupol](https://mwi.westpoint.edu/defending-mariupol/)
    and [Bakhmut](https://mwi.westpoint.edu/the-battle-of-bakhmut/), in the ongoing
    war in Ukraine. Modern nations including the United States, China, and North Korea
    invest billions in deep-buried military bunkers and tunnel complexes. But what
    Israel has faced in Gaza represents a unique first in war—namely, a case in which
    tunnels form one of two pillars, along with time, of a combatant’s political-military
    strategy.

    passages, but for blast doors, workshops, sleeping quarters, toilets, kitchens,

    been built specifically to gain a *military* advantage. They are used for smuggling,
    kidnapping, and invading or defending territory. Underground spaces enable militaries
    to conserve capabilities by avoiding detection and strike, to hold terrain by
    using the tunnels for mobile defense tactics, or even offensively to use guerrilla
    tactics to attrit the attacking force.

    a tunnel network to gain not just a military advantage, but a *political* advantage,
    as well. Its underground world serves all of the military functions described
    above, but also an entirely different one. Hamas weaved its vast tunnel networks
    into the society on the surface. Destroying the tunnels is virtually impossible
    without adversely impacting the population living in Gaza. Consequently, they
    put the modern laws of war at the center of the conflict’s conduct. These laws
    restrict the use of military force and methods or tactics that a military can
    use against [protected populations and sites](https://www.redcross.org/content/dam/redcross/atg/PDF_s/International_Services/International_Humanitarian_Law/IHL_SummaryGenevaConv.pdf)

    densely populated urban areas. Much of the infrastructure providing access to
    the tunnels is in protected sites. This complicates discriminating between military
    targets and civilian locations—if not rendering it entirely impossible—because
    Hamas does not have military sites separate from civilian sites.

    operation. The group wants as many civilians as possible to be harmed by Israeli
    military action—as one of its officials put it, “[We are proud to sacrifice martyrs](https://thehill.com/opinion/international/4295601-human-sacrifice-is-central-to-hamass-strategy/).”
    It wants the world’s attention on the question of whether the IDF campaign is
    violating the laws of war in attacking Hamas tunnels that are tightly connected
    to civilian and protected sites. It wants to buy as much time as is needed to
    cause the international community to stop Israel. Its entire strategy is built
    on tunnels.

    demonstrated some of the world’s [most advanced units](https://www.timesofisrael.com/spotlight/your-support-helps-yahalom-win-the-war-against-hamas/),
    methods, and capabilities to find, exploit, and destroy tunnels. From specialized
    engineer capabilities and [canine units](https://www.forbes.com/sites/erictegler/2023/11/21/israels-shifa-tunnel-footage-shows-a-drone-dog-approach-to-exploring/?sh=18743c2f1622)

    to destroy them. Arguably, no military in the world is as well prepared for subterranean
    tactical challenges as the IDF. But the strategic challenge is entirely different.
    To destroy many of the deep-buried tunnels, the IDF has required bunker-busting
    bombs, which Israel is [criticized for using](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/21/world/middleeast/israel-gaza-bomb-investigation.html).
    And most importantly it has required time to find and destroy the tunnels in a
    conflict in which Hamas’s strategy is aimed at limiting the time available to
    Israel to conduct its campaign.
