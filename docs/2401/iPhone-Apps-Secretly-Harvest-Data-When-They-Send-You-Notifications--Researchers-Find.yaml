- en: iPhone apps including Facebook, LinkedIn, TikTok, and X/Twitter are skirting
    Apple’s privacy rules to collect user data through notifications, according to
    tests by security researchers at [Mysk Inc.](https://www.mysk.blog/), an app development
    company. Users sometimes close apps to stop them from collecting data in the background,
    but this technique gets around that protection. The data is unnecessary for processing
    notifications, the researchers said, and seems related to analytics, advertising,
    and tracking users across different apps and devices. Some of the companies involved
    said these findings are inaccurate.

- en: It’s par for the course that apps would find opportunities to sneak in more
    data collection, but “we were surprised to learn that this practice is widely
    used,” said Tommy Mysk, who conducted the tests along with Talal Haj Bakry. “Who
    would have known that an innocuous action as simple as dismissing a notification
    would trigger sending a lot of unique device information to remote servers? It
    is worrying when you think about the fact that developers can do that on-demand.”

    it’s a widespread problem plaguing the iPhone ecosystem. However, spokespeople
    for Meta and LinkedIn categorically denied the data is used for advertising or
    other inappropriate purposes. A LinkedIn spokesperson said the data is only used
    to ensure notifications work properly, and the company follows all of Apple’s
    developer guidelines. Apple, TikTok, and X/Twitter didn’t immediately answer Gizmodo’s
    questions for this article.

- en: This isn’t the first time Mysk’s tests have uncovered data problems at Apple,
    which has spent untold millions convincing the world that “what happens on your
    iPhone, stays on your iPhone.” In October 2023, Mysk found that a lauded iPhone
    feature meant to protect details about your WiFi address [isn’t as private as
    the company promises](https://twitter.com/mysk_co/status/1717541345223389346).
    In 2022, Apple was hit with [over a dozen class action lawsuits](https://gizmodo.com/apple-iphone-privacy-analytics-12-lawsuits-statement-1850077715)
    after Gizmodo reported on Mysk’s finding that Apple collects data about its users
    [even after they flip the switch on an iPhone privacy setting](https://gizmodo.com/apple-iphone-analytics-tracking-even-when-off-app-store-1849757558)
    that promises to “disable the sharing of device analytics altogether.”

    companies use to identify you based on several seemingly innocuous details about
    your device. Fingerprinting circumvents privacy protections to track people and
    send them targeted ads—and Apple explicitly forbids companies from doing it. iPhones
    and other Apple products have many settings and rules in place that are supposed
    to give you control over when companies can identify you and collect data.

    Facebook, the app collects IP addresses, the number of milliseconds since your
    phone was restarted, the amount of free memory space on your phone, and a host
    of other details. Combining data like these is enough to identify a person with
    a high level of accuracy. The other apps in the test collected similar information.
    LinkedIn, for example, uses notifications to gather which timezone you’re in,
    your display brightness, and what mobile carrier you’re using, the test showed.
    Mysk said LinkedIn also collects a host of other information that seems specifically
    related to advertising campaign (a LinkedIn spokesperson called this inaccurate.) It’s
    worth noting that just because an app can collect this info, doesn’t mean that
    it is using it.

    or related analytics, cross device or cross app tracking,” a LinkedIn spokesperson
    said. “Data that is collected is only used to confirm that a notification was
    successfully sent and, on a transient basis, to queue the app experience in case
    the member chooses to launch the app in response to the notification never shared
    externally.” The spokesperson said the data is never shared externally.

    accurate. People log into our app on their device and provide permission to enable
    notifications,” said Emil Vazquez, a Meta spokesperson. “We may periodically use
    this information, even when the app isn’t running, to help us deliver timely,
    reliable notifications, using Apple’s APIs. This is consistent with our policies.”

    data, but they’re valuable for advertising and other purposes. What many people
    don’t realize is that targeted advertising and other invasions of digital privacy
    are all about figuring out your identity. Companies know what you’re doing on
    their apps—but they don’t always know who you are, and data is a lot less useful
    if you don’t know whose it is. If companies can’t identify you, they can’t target
    you with ads.

    data collection and targeted ads, but settings such as the iPhone’s “[Ask App
    Not To Track](https://gizmodo.com/how-apple-s-ask-app-not-to-track-prompt-helped-tiktok-1849772915)”
    control block that ad ID. In theory, that’s supposed to stop companies from tying
    together information about you and your behavior from different apps and other
    parts of the internet. But fingerprinting is a sneaky way to keep doing it anyway.

    an app closed is supposed to cut off the flow of data and stop an app from running
    whatsoever. However, it seems notifications provide a backdoor.

- en: '[Apple provides special software](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/usernotifications/unnotificationserviceextension)
    to help your apps send notifications. For some notifications, the app might need
    to play a sound or download text, images, or other information. If the app is
    closed, the iPhone operating system lets the app wake up temporarily to contact
    company servers, send you the notification, and perform any other necessary business.
    The data harvesting Mysk spotted happened during this brief window.'

    the app starts in the background and sends back details,” Mysk said. Or if a company
    like TikTok or X/Twitter wanted a quick update on the IP addresses of 100,000
    people who have their apps closed, one quick notification is all it would take.
    “It’s mind-blowing,” he said.

    with notifications in order to optimize its services. However, Mysk said there
    are a few reasons to think that’s not why apps are collecting this data.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For one, Apple [gives app developers details](https://developer.apple.com/notifications/)
    about what’s going on with notifications directly, so there’s no need to collect
    additional information if you know what happened after you pinged your users.
    Furthermore, a lot of the data that apps are collecting seems unrelated to analyzing
    how well notifications are working, like your phone’s available disk space or
    the time since your last reboot, Mysk said.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Beyond that, other data-hungry companies are sending notifications without feasting
    on all of this other information. When Mysk tested Gmail and YouTube, for example,
    the apps only collected data that was obviously related to processing notifications.
    Mysk said if a company like Google can send you a notification without snooping
    on other details, that suggests there are ulterior motives for the data collection
    he spotted.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There are a few potentially innocent explanations for the notifications data
    problem. For example, developers sometimes leave old code in their apps that performs
    functions that companies don’t need anymore. It’s theoretically possible that
    an app like LinkedIn might be set up to collect data that isn’t used for any purposes
    whatsoever. The researchers, however, said that’s hard to believe.

- en: There’s an upcoming change to the iPhone operating system’s rules that could
    improve the situation, but it’s not clear whether it will solve the problem. Starting
    in Spring 2024, app developers will be [required to explain](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/privacy_manifest_files/describing_use_of_required_reason_api)
    why and how they’re using certain “APIs,” which, in this context, are essentially
    pieces of software that apps use to communicate with each other and the iPhone
    operating system.

    you—and if they’re collecting data for illegitimate purposes, maybe they’ll have
    to stop. “The bad news is that it is unclear how Apple is going to enforce it,”
    Mysk said.

    which would get in the way of that solution, and Apple [doesn’t have a stellar

    of enforcing similar rules.
