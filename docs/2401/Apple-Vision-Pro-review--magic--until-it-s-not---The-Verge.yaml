    plastic and often downright goofy-looking. The Vision Pro, by contrast, is built
    of magnesium and carbon fiber in an aluminum enclosure that feels like a natural
    extension of Apple’s familiar design language. There’s a little iPhone 6 in there,
    a little AirPods Max, a little Apple Watch. It is the cutting edge of technology
    in a package that seems instantly familiar. Almost everyone I’ve shown it to thinks
    it looks smaller in person than they expected, especially compared to some of
    the huge VR headsets we’ve seen over the past decade.

    while you’re wearing the headset — a feature adorably called EyeSight. In reality,
    it might as well not be there. It’s a low-res OLED with a lenticular panel in
    front of it to provide a mild 3D effect, and it’s so dim and the cover glass is
    so reflective, it’s actually hard to see in most normal to bright lighting. When
    people *do* see your eyes, it’s a low-res, ghostly image of them that feels like
    CGI. The effect is uncanny — the idea that you’ll be making real eye contact with
    anyone is a fantasy. And there are no controls or indicators in visionOS for this
    external display, so you never really know what other people are seeing. Imagine
    looking someone directly in the eyes and talking to them *without knowing if they
    can see your eyes* — it’s weird!

    want, but you get a bunch of extra features if you use the latest AirPods Pro,

    automatically mixes in sound from the real world as appropriate.

    thing about the hardware after a while is that it’s just… heavy. You’re supposed
    to wear this thing on your face for long stretches of computer time, and depending
    on which band and light seal you use, the headset alone weighs between 600 and
    650 grams. I keep joking that the Vision Pro is an iPad for your face, but it’s
    heavier than an 11-inch iPad Pro (470 grams) and pushing close to a 12.9-inch
    iPad Pro (682 grams), so in a very real way, it’s an iPad for your face.

    like the Quest Pro (722 grams) have elaborate headbands to balance out their weight,
    but the Vision Pro just rests it all on the front. Swapping to the dual loop strap
    helps keep things more stable but doesn’t really reduce the overall sensation

    or even the heavier Quest 3 (515g) — headsets that have built-in batteries. Apple
    told me that it chose to use an external battery specifically to reduce the headset’s
    weight. The battery itself is barely worth talking about — it’s a silver brick
    that weighs another 353 grams with a USB-C port and a motion-activated LED that’s
    green when it’s charged and orange when it’s not. It connects to the headset with
    a satisfying twist connector, but the nice braided cable is permanently attached
    to the battery itself, so don’t break it. You can buy extra batteries for $199,
    but you can’t hot-swap them; disconnecting the battery from the Vision Pro cuts
    the power entirely.
  prefs: []

- en: I don’t really have strong opinions on this battery setup, which is mostly because
    nothing about the Vision Pro feels like you’re supposed to move around that much
    in it, so it’s more or less fine. It’s funny that Apple of all companies shipped
    this compromise, but it’s also very Apple that the battery is not actually bigger
    so it can provide more than two and a half hours of run time. (If you plug the
    battery in, the Vision Pro just runs on wall power for as long as you want.)

    only manual adjustments involved. Everything else is motorized and sensor-driven.
    There’s no fiddly lens wheel to dial in; the headset asks you to hold down the
    digital crown when you first put it on to adjust the lenses to your eyes, and
    then you go through a pretty standard eye tracking setup. The rest of the setup
    is almost exactly like any other iOS device: if you have an iPhone, you can bring
    it close to the Vision Pro to send over all your settings, and you have to agree
    to some terms and conditions. If you don’t have an iPhone, you’ll have to enter
    your passwords and so on manually, but it’ll work fine as a standalone device.
    After all of that, you’re computing in the future.'

    — they represent a huge leap forward in display technology. The two displays are
    tiny MicroOLEDs with a total of 23 million pixels that are just 7.5 micrometers
    in size, which is about the size of a red blood cell. And each of *those* tiny
    pixels is composed of three RGB subpixels laid out in what Apple tells me is an
    S-stripe pattern. Just thinking about the level of precision required to make
    these displays and then make them work in a device like this is mind-blowing.

    in your lap, up in the air with your elbows on a table, pretty much anywhere the
    cameras can see them. It actually takes a minute to realize you don’t have to
    gesture out in front of you with your hands in the air — and once you figure it

    quality.) That virtual display is then streamed as a 4K 3560 x 2880 video to the

- en: The Vision Pro is an astounding product. It’s the sort of first-generation device
    only Apple can really make, from the incredible display and passthrough engineering,
    to the use of the whole ecosystem to make it so seamlessly useful, to even getting
    everyone to pretty much ignore the whole external battery situation. There’s a
    part of me that says the Vision Pro only exists because Apple is so incredibly
    capable, stocked with talent, and loaded with resources that the company simply
    went out and engineered the hell out of the hardest problems it could think of
    in order to find a challenge.

    with the kind of thoughtful intention that few other companies can ever deliver
    at all, let alone on the first iteration. But the shocking thing is that Apple
    may have inadvertently revealed that some of these core ideas are actually dead
    ends — that they can’t ever be executed well enough to become mainstream. This
    is the best video passthrough headset ever made, and that might mean camera-based
    mixed reality passthrough could just be a road to nowhere. This is the best hand-
    and eye-tracking ever, and it feels like the mouse, keyboard, and touchscreen
    are going to remain undefeated for years to come. There is so much technology
    in this thing that feels like magic when it works and frustrates you completely
    when it doesn’t.

- en: 'The other way to look at the Vision Pro is that Apple knows all of this, but
    the technology to build the true AR glasses it has long hinted at is simply not
    there — so the Vision Pro represents something like a simulator or a developer
    kit. A dream factory for people to build apps and meaningful use cases for the
    imagined hardware yet to come: true optical AR glasses that let you share digital
    experiences with other people. In that framework, this Vision Pro is the hardware
    Apple *can* ship right now to get everyone thinking about these ideas while it
    pours all those resources into the hardware it *wants* to build. Maybe! It’s fun
    to think about that possibility, and a lot of people have already assumed that’s
    the case.'

    review what’s in the box — the product that’s shipping today, not the promise
    of improvements yet to come. And so I keep coming back to all the questions I’ve
    been asking myself ever since I first strapped the Vision Pro onto my head. Starting,
    of course, with the most important:'

    tradeoff of all is that using the Vision Pro is such a lonely experience, regardless
    of the weird ghost eyes on the front. You’re in there, having experiences all
    by yourself that no one else can take part in. After using the Vision Pro for
    a while, I’ve come to agree with what Tim Cook has been saying for so long: headsets
    are inherently isolating. That’s fine for traditional VR headsets, which have
    basically turned into single-use game consoles over the past decade, but it’s
    a lot weirder for a primary computing device.'
