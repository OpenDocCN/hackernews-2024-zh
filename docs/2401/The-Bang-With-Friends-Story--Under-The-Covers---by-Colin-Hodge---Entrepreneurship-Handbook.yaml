    banned us from the App Store without explanation. We got cut off from our top
    source of new users with only the vaguest hint at why, despite repeated emails
    and phone calls.

    I was “hardly the Tucker Max misogynist you might have expected to invent something
    like this. Rather, he comes across more like a friendly, sex positive brogrammer
    in search of a viral loop.” I went on to do video interviews and conferences across
    the world, learning on-the-fly how to tackle public speaking in front of thousands.

    party in San Francisco ended with women dancing on the bar and an afterparty at
    our office, known as “The BangPad.”

- en: Two months after the drama with Apple, Zynga sued us over the use of “With Friends”
    for alleged trademark infringement on their game, Words With Friends. Legal and
    tech pundits weighed in, with many stating the obvious. “With friends” is a generic
    descriptor that perfectly described our app’s functionality. It seemed implausible
    that consumers would confuse a family-friendly Scrabble-copycat game with our
    raunchy hookup app. Still, Zynga’s war chest threatened to bankrupt us, so we
    resolved the issue in mediation.

  zh: 两个月后，与苹果公司的纠纷之后，Zynga以对我们使用“With Friends”涉嫌侵犯其游戏《Words With Friends》商标的诉讼起诉了我们。法律和技术专家纷纷发表意见，其中许多人指出了显而易见的事实。“With
    friends”是一个通用描述词，完美地描述了我们应用的功能。消费者似乎不会把一个家庭友好的抄袭《Scrabble》的游戏与我们的粗鲁约炮应用混淆。尽管如此，Zynga的庞大资金威胁着让我们破产，因此我们通过调解解决了这个问题。
- en: We evolved the brand for broader appeal, not limited to “friends” or “banging,”
    and avoided paying them a cent. Our simple yet communicative new brand, [DOWN](https://www.downapp.com/),
    still had a playful side with its wink to the colloquial phrases “Down to Fuck
    (DTF)” and “Are you down?” yet allowed us on the app stores and a broader product.

    to Fuck (DTF)”和“Are you down?”眨了眨眼，但也使我们能够进入应用商店并推出更广泛的产品。

    like your world is crashing down around you, take a step back and think of what
    advice you’d give to another entrepreneur. Then make those difficult decisions:
    downsize, cut features or whole products, and be scrappy: squeeze the most out
    of your runway by delaying or negotiating bills, moving to free trials, etc.'

    news. First, we brought our scintillating “Bangability” feature, a sort of hotness
    score based on swipes on your profile and calibrated to similar people near you,
    to our mobile apps. This Hot-or-Not-like rating drove virality and coverage from

    for almost six months, we rolled out our unique and sexy new design to great reviews.
    Unlike Tinder’s card-like UX with 2 gestures (left or right), we focused on 3-way
    gestures to express your true intentions: up to “hang” (date), down to “get down”,
