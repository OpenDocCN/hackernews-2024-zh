    banned us from the App Store without explanation. We got cut off from our top
    source of new users with only the vaguest hint at why, despite repeated emails
    and phone calls.

    when I drove down to their Cupertino HQ to find out why!

    title, we got reinstated some three months later.

    jeopardizing our private lives, other startups, and a key press angle. Yet, the
    leak freed me up for two key plays that were previously impossible: public appearances
    and exclusive Bang With Friends parties.'

    harsh Valleywag, who helped reduce our frat-boy image when [they said](https://valleywag.gawker.com/meet-the-28-year-old-ceo-of-bang-with-friends-509602077)
    I was “hardly the Tucker Max misogynist you might have expected to invent something
    like this. Rather, he comes across more like a friendly, sex positive brogrammer
    in search of a viral loop.” I went on to do video interviews and conferences across
    the world, learning on-the-fly how to tackle public speaking in front of thousands.

    were thrilling. With a custom site for each event, attendees would sign up for
    party access and to match with each other.

    sat on my lap, and whispered in my ear, “my editor wanted me to get a story on
    you, but I told him tonight I’m going to fuck you instead.”

    of our hookup, including dick size and skills, despite her promises of off-record
    action. Thankfully, she decided against sharing it with her editor! Our at-capacity
    party in San Francisco ended with women dancing on the bar and an afterparty at
    our office, known as “The BangPad.”

- en: Two months after the drama with Apple, Zynga sued us over the use of “With Friends”
    for alleged trademark infringement on their game, Words With Friends. Legal and
    tech pundits weighed in, with many stating the obvious. “With friends” is a generic
    descriptor that perfectly described our app’s functionality. It seemed implausible
    that consumers would confuse a family-friendly Scrabble-copycat game with our
    raunchy hookup app. Still, Zynga’s war chest threatened to bankrupt us, so we
    resolved the issue in mediation.

    and avoided paying them a cent. Our simple yet communicative new brand, [DOWN](https://www.downapp.com/),
    still had a playful side with its wink to the colloquial phrases “Down to Fuck
    (DTF)” and “Are you down?” yet allowed us on the app stores and a broader product.

    like your world is crashing down around you, take a step back and think of what
    advice you’d give to another entrepreneur. Then make those difficult decisions:
    downsize, cut features or whole products, and be scrappy: squeeze the most out
    of your runway by delaying or negotiating bills, moving to free trials, etc.'

    news. First, we brought our scintillating “Bangability” feature, a sort of hotness
    score based on swipes on your profile and calibrated to similar people near you,
    to our mobile apps. This Hot-or-Not-like rating drove virality and coverage from
    [Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/downs-bangability-scores-2013-12?op=1),
    [VICE](https://www.vice.com/en/article/533e4n/bangability-a-klout-score-for-bang-with-friends),

    for almost six months, we rolled out our unique and sexy new design to great reviews.
    Unlike Tinder’s card-like UX with 2 gestures (left or right), we focused on 3-way
    gestures to express your true intentions: up to “hang” (date), down to “get down”,
    and left to skip.'

    each profile felt fresh versus the more utilitarian feel compared to other apps.
