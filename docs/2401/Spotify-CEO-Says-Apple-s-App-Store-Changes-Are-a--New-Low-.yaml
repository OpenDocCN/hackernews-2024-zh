- en: Apple announced it will for the first time allow developers to create and distribute
    apps on third-party marketplaces once it releases iOS 17.4\. The changes will
    only take effect in the EU, which has forced Apple to comply with the [Digital
    Markets Act](https://www.businessinsider.com/a-new-eu-law-targeting-big-tech-could-boost-advertisers-2022-3)
    — a European law aimed at curtailing tech giants' hold over the digital economy.

  zh: 苹果宣布，一旦发布iOS 17.4版，将首次允许开发者在第三方市场上创建和分发应用程序。这些变化只会在欧盟生效，这迫使苹果遵守[数字市场法](https://www.businessinsider.com/a-new-eu-law-targeting-big-tech-could-boost-advertisers-2022-3)——这是一项旨在遏制科技巨头对数字经济的控制的欧洲法律。
- en: While this may sound like a victory for app developers since it will open up
    more channels for distribution, many are complaining that Apple will not only
    retain control over which third-party marketplaces end up on its system but will
    also charge fees for downloads on those other marketplaces.

  zh: 尽管这听起来像是对应用开发者的一次胜利，因为它将开启更多的分销渠道，但许多人抱怨苹果不仅会保留对其系统中哪些第三方市场最终上线的控制权，而且还会对这些其他市场上的下载收费。

    apps with over one million downloads will need to pay a "core technology fee"
    for "each first annual install per year." That puts an app like Spotify — which
    Ek said has more than 100 million downloads in the EU — in an "untenable situation"
    because it drastically increasesthe cost of acquiring new customers.

  zh: 根据[苹果的新变化](https://developer.apple.com/support/core-technology-fee/#:~:text=First%20annual%20installs,-The%20first%20annual&text=Each%20first%20annual%20install%20initiates,app%20by%20the%20same%20account.)，拥有一百万以上下载量的应用每年都需要为“每个第一年度安装”支付“核心技术费用”。这让像Spotify这样的应用——Ek表示其在欧盟拥有超过一亿次下载——处于一个“难以持续的境地”，因为它大幅增加了获得新客户的成本。
- en: In a statement, Spotify described the fee as "extortion, plain and simple."
    The company says the feewill likely hurt developers, potential start-ups, and
    those offering free apps who might not have the funds to pay Apple — especially
    if their app suddenly goes viral.

  zh: Spotify在一份声明中将这项费用描述为“明显的勒索”。公司表示，这项费用可能会伤害开发者、潜在的初创公司以及那些提供免费应用的人，他们可能没有资金支付给苹果——特别是如果他们的应用突然爆红的话。

    "stick with the status quo" to remain profitable, Ek said.

    choice — with new options to distribute iOS apps and process payments," a spokesperson
    for Apple told Business Insider by email. "Every developer can choose to stay

    would pay the same or less to Apple."'

- en: While Apple's tight hold over the iOS ecosystem has helped it reap billions
    in revenue, it has also caused it to run afoul of regulators who believe its tactics
    stifle innovation and suppress new entrants. Ek, too, is a [longtime critic of
    Apple's tactics](https://www.businessinsider.com/spotify-ceo-daniel-ek-apple-platform-2020-5)
    and has previously said the company has a ways to go before it becomes an "open

    they pass muster with the EU. And Ek said he's hoping the EU "recognizes this

    all be for nothing."
