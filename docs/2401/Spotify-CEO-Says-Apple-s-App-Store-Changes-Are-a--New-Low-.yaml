- en: Apple announced it will for the first time allow developers to create and distribute
    apps on third-party marketplaces once it releases iOS 17.4\. The changes will
    only take effect in the EU, which has forced Apple to comply with the [Digital
    Markets Act](https://www.businessinsider.com/a-new-eu-law-targeting-big-tech-could-boost-advertisers-2022-3)
    — a European law aimed at curtailing tech giants' hold over the digital economy.

    more channels for distribution, many are complaining that Apple will not only
    retain control over which third-party marketplaces end up on its system but will
    also charge fees for downloads on those other marketplaces.

    apps with over one million downloads will need to pay a "core technology fee"
    for "each first annual install per year." That puts an app like Spotify — which
    Ek said has more than 100 million downloads in the EU — in an "untenable situation"
    because it drastically increasesthe cost of acquiring new customers.

    The company says the feewill likely hurt developers, potential start-ups, and
    those offering free apps who might not have the funds to pay Apple — especially
    if their app suddenly goes viral.

    "stick with the status quo" to remain profitable, Ek said.

    choice — with new options to distribute iOS apps and process payments," a spokesperson
    for Apple told Business Insider by email. "Every developer can choose to stay
    on the same terms in place today. And under the new terms, more than 99% of developers
    would pay the same or less to Apple."'

- en: While Apple's tight hold over the iOS ecosystem has helped it reap billions
    in revenue, it has also caused it to run afoul of regulators who believe its tactics
    stifle innovation and suppress new entrants. Ek, too, is a [longtime critic of
    Apple's tactics](https://www.businessinsider.com/spotify-ceo-daniel-ek-apple-platform-2020-5)
    and has previously said the company has a ways to go before it becomes an "open
    and fair platform."

    spirit of the law and the lawmakers who wrote it," Ek said.

    they pass muster with the EU. And Ek said he's hoping the EU "recognizes this
    for exactly what it is and stands firm and doesn't let their work over the years
    all be for nothing."
