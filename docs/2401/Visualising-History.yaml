    [Information is Beautiful](https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=txlTrsIsV1UC&printsec=frontcover&dq=information+is+beautiful&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwigwJCdgYfqAhWYQEEAHdodDrsQ6AEIMjAB)
    by David McCandless. This was one of a wave of bestselling texts that appeared
    in the early 2010s which aimed to show how data could both be presented in an
    appealing fashion and communicate a core idea. These texts made the case for visualisations
    being used to give a clearer picture of a dense set of information - one that
    would be impossible to see from the dull perspective of the spreadsheet alone.

- en: 'Maps and spacial diagrams have always had a special power in this regard. They
    allow us to see information from a different perspective, showing us connections
    and relations that would likely escape us, to visualise data in its spacial context.
    As Franco Moretti put it in his [Atlas of the European Novel](https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/Atlas_of_the_European_Novel_1800_1900.html?id=ja2MUXS_YQUC)
    - “A good map is worth a thousand words, cartographers say, and they are right:
    because it *produces* a thousand words: it raises doubts, ideas. It poses new
    questions, and forces you to look for new answers.”'

  zh: 地图和空间图表在这方面一直具有特殊的力量。它们使我们能够从不同的角度看待信息，显示出我们可能忽略的连接和关系，以空间背景来可视化数据。正如弗兰科·莫雷蒂在他的《[欧洲小说地图集1800-1900](https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/Atlas_of_the_European_Novel_1800_1900.html?id=ja2MUXS_YQUC)》中所说：“好的地图价值千言万语，制图师说，他们是正确的：因为它*产生*了千言万语：它引发了怀疑、想法。它提出了新问题，并迫使你寻找新的答案。”

    Febvre and Henri-Jean Martin. In their seminal work on the history of print, [L’Apparition
    du Livre](https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=4Z-CabpN1UwC), they produced a series
    of simple hand drawn maps. With these they hoped to communicate to the reader
    the extraordinary fast paced growth of Gutenberg’s invention.

    places where evidence of a printing press could be found. In order to give some
    sense to their reader of the spread of the new technology, differently sized circles
    were utilised in the legend: Before 1481; 1481-1490; 1491-1500\. It was simple,
    but effective, and it managed to capture what was an extremely fluid period of
    commercial experimentation.'

    Johann Neumeister, who went from Germany to Italy, then to Mainz, onwards to Basel,
    then to Lyon, Toulouse and Albi. The Florentine [Giunta family](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giunti_(printers)),
    whose members established presses at Venice and Lyon, as well as bookshops and
    warehouses in Antwerp, Burgos, Frankfurt, Lisbon, Medina del Campo, Paris, Salamanca
    and Zaragoza. Or [Jan Hallar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Haller), a

    the sixteenth century.

    could only provide basic visual snapshots to their audience of these changes.
    For the extraordinary growth of printing in the sixteenth and seventeenth century
    no map was provided. At the end of the 1950s, with computer systems in their infancy
    and library holdings described only in card catalogues, gathering quantitive data
    on printing activity for such a map would appear to be impossible.

- en: With the dual developments in personal computing and analytical bibliography
    over the last fifty years it is possible to revisit these early experiments in
    mapping print. We can take things further and show the emergence and disappearance
    of printing activity before the mid-seventeenth century. By combining the yearly
    output of presses we can also add the volume of printed activity into the mix.
    This enables us to see printed production as a fluid entity, one that can expand
    and contract, or even disappear off the map altogether.

    activity before 1650\. Some like Paris, Venice, Basel, Frankfurt, Lyon, Antwerp
    and London come as no surprise and produce a hum of activity. In contrast, some
    towns are so small, that it seems unimaginable that they ever had a press for
    any time at all. Other popup presses were briefly active in monasteries and castles,
    while some towns no longer exist today.

    No dataset is perfect and scholars are constantly discovering new items or archival

    It is worth noting that in the data I used any edition that had a date expressed
    as a range of years i.e. 1620-1622, or without a date was discounted. As too were
    items from fictitious places of printing and some scattered places that could
    not be identified. Due to the difficulty in rendering the entire globe at one
    time - and in a usable fashion - areas like Goa or Mexico were not included. A
    future post will address this and look at printing beyond Europe.'

    值得注意的是，在我使用的数据中，任何日期表达为一系列年份（即1620-1622年）或没有日期的版本都被排除在外。同样，来自虚构印刷地点以及一些无法识别的零散地点的项目也被排除在外。由于一次性呈现整个地球的困难——并以一种可用的方式呈现——诸如果阿或墨西哥等地区没有包含在内。未来的帖子将解决这个问题，并研究欧洲以外的印刷情况。
