    projects to move us toward a more sustainable future. Now, we want to tell you
    what these changes mean for our games, everything around them (esports, Arcane,
    music, etc.), and what to expect going forward.

- en: For most of our history, we’ve managed to avoid days like this, but this decision
    is critical for the future of Riot. This isn’t to appease shareholders or to hit
    a quarterly earnings number—it’s a necessity. Over the past few years, as Riot
    more than doubled in headcount, we spread our efforts across more and more projects
    without sharp enough razors to decide what players needed most. The adjustments
    we're making aim to focus us on the areas that have the greatest impact on your
    experience while reducing investment on things that don’t.

    11% of Rioters, with the biggest impact to teams outside of core development.
    We recognize that many of you don’t just care about the games you play, but also
    about the people who make them. These are not just organizational changes; they
    affect individuals and families, and we do our best to approach these decisions
    with respect and sensitivity. If you’d like to read the email we sent to Rioters,
    we’ve shared it [here](https://www.riotgames.com/en/news/2024-rioter-update).

- en: Our vision for the future is bold and our commitment to our core live games
    – League of Legends, VALORANT, Teamfight Tactics, and Wild Rift – is more ambitious
    than ever. We're prioritizing these teams so they can focus on the content, features,
    and updates that directly respond to what you’ve been asking for. Expect events,
    modes, and long-term roadmaps that lead to vibrant (hopefully multi-decade) futures
    for these games.

- en: Our strategy will more tightly integrate esports, music, and entertainment with
    our games. Esports isn't just about competition; it's about the highs, the lows,
    and the communities that flourish around the games. Entertainment isn't just about
    storytelling; it's a gateway to the deeper narratives, characters, and worlds
    that enrich the game experience. As we’ve grown, some of our efforts have become
    more isolated, and we aspire to more seamlessly blend gameplay, competitive excellence,
    and narrative depth in ways that truly make it better to be a player. Whether
    it’s the next hit from K/DA, the story unfolding in Arcane, the intensity of a
    TFT Open, the one-of-a-kind chills of a Worlds game 5, or the electric atmosphere
    of VAL Champs, our focus is on quality, impact, and unified experiences for players
    around the world.

    to you when they’re ready. Project L has been making great progress and we’re
    looking for more opportunities for you to try out the game (stay tuned for more
    updates coming later this year). Arcane Season 2 is on track for November 2024\.
    Plus, we have a number of projects cooking in various stages of R&D.

- en: Our volume of releases will never be massive. We want everything we deliver
    to be something that you can be proud of and excited to share with friends. That
    requires having financial flexibility to be able to take the time to make things
    that are truly great for players. We know we’ll still have occasional misses,
    but we want those misses to be for the right reasons, not because we prioritized
    the wrong things or had to rush projects out the door before they were ready.

    We know there’s a passionate community who absolutely love this game—we do too.
    Despite critical achievements and the role it’s played in helping to build out
    the world of Runeterra, LoR has faced financial challenges since launch, costing
    significantly more to develop and support than it generates. In response, we're
    reducing the size of our team and renewing our focus on The Path of Champions.
    This shift allows the team to experiment more in the PvE space, concentrating
    on the game mode where players have been spending the most time. The LoR team
    has more details [here](https://playruneterra.com/en-us/news/game-updates/state-of-the-game-2024),
    and we have a video planned for the coming weeks to talk more about the future.

    of *Bandle Tale: A League of Legends Story*. Forge was an experiment to see what
    would happen when Rioters partnered with their favorite indie devs and let them
    loose on Runeterra with their unique viewpoints, styles, and expertise. Across
    six titles spanning different game genres, regions, and characters, it’s been
    inspiring to see what these devs created in partnership with the Forge team. We’re
    proud of what we’ve done together to bring these stories to life, but it’s time
    to refocus our efforts on the ambitious projects underway internally at Riot.'
