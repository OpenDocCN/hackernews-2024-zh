- en: Happy New Year, hackers! I started the new year 2024 with a personal milestone
    of mine. [The KDE Plasma 5.27](https://kde.org/plasma-desktop/) is available on
    OpenBSD -current and will be part of the next release 7.5. I’m sure not very many
    people would understand how large this work. It started so many years ago that
    I don’t even know how long I’ve been working on it. Definitely years and not just
    1 or 2\. I remember that before I joined the OpenBSD community, Vadim Zhukov did
    a lot of work in the Qt/KDE area. In the early days, it was good to have someone
    to talk to, or just to know “you’re not alone”. This has not been the case for
    a long time. I’ve been doing it alone for years, just like Vadim did it alone
    for years. It’s probably the burden of the project, we are a super small team
    of OpenBSD kernel and ports developers.

    of reviews and thus made it possible that we have KDE as packages.

    have plans? Sure I could just continue to maintain the whole thing. What will
    definitely be interesting is the KDE switch from Qt5 to Qt6\. This should not
    be a big challenge for OpenBSD. All dependencies like all Qt6 modules are ported.
    So this will just be a task of hard work.

    begins. Let us be surprised what 2024 will bring.
