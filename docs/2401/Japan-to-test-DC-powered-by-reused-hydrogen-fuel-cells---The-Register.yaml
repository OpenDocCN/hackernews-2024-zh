- en: Honda and Mitsubishi are to test the feasibility of powering a datacenter with
    fuel cells taken from electric vehicles, using hydrogen produced as a byproduct
    of an industrial process.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The project is scheduled to run for two years from March 31 in Shunan City,
    Japan. It aims to assess any reduction in carbon dioxide emissions from datacenter
    ops by powering a "distributed datacenter" run by Mitsubishi from a stationary
    fuel cell power station that Honda is developing, using fuel cells repurposed
    from the EVs.

- en: Hydrogen for the fuel cell power station will be provided by a third Japanese
    company, Tokuyama Corporation, as a byproduct from its salt water electrolysis
    business, which manufactures about 50,000 tons of sodium hypochlorite each year.

    Organization (NEDO), which promotes the research, development and adoption of
    industrial, energy and environmental technologies.

    and operate stationary fuel cell systems, which could ultimately contribute to
    the decarbonization of the electric power supply.

- en: No details were disclosed of the kind of datacenter infrastructure that Mitsubishi
    will operate as part of this project, so it is unknown how much power the fuel
    cell power station will be required to supply. We have asked that question.

- en: Hydrogen and fuel cells have been in the news frequently over the past few years
    as a potential way of providing greener power for datacenters, either as a backup
    power source in place of diesel generators or as the primary power source itself.

    claimed to be the first in Europe to deploy a hydrogen-powered fuel cell module
    to replace backup power generators at its site at Groningen.

- en: Hydrogen can be considered a clean fuel because it produces only water as a
    byproduct when consumed in a fuel cell. But the problem is in sourcing the hydrogen.
    Much commercially produced hydrogen is extracted from methane gas via an energy-intensive
    process typically powered by fossil fuels.

- en: It is likely that the process Tokuyama uses in its salt water electrolysis is
    ultimately powered by fossil fuels, but the hydrogen is produced as a byproduct
    and this is currently just a demonstration project to evaluate the feasibility
    of integrated hydrogen business models.

    sources in datacenters, the project will also look at the potential for grid-balancing
    applications.

    which implemented "[grid-interactive UPS technology](https://www.theregister.com/2023/02/24/microsoft_wants_to_export_grid_interactive/)"
    to allow its facility to supply energy back to the grid if necessary, with the
    goal of smoothing out any variability in the power supply due to the unpredictability
    of renewable energy sources.

    to expand the number of bit barns in the region that run on cleaner power, as
    well as explore business opportunities for the technology elsewhere. ®
