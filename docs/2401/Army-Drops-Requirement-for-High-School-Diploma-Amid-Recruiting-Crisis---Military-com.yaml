- en: The [Army](http://www.military.com/army) is tossing its mandate for potential
    recruits to have a high school diploma or GED certificate to enlist in the service,
    in one of the most dramatic moves yet in the escalating [recruiting](https://www.military.com/join-armed-forces)
    crisis hitting the entire Defense Department.

    in the active-duty Army. They also must score at least a 50 on the Armed Services
    Vocational Aptitude Battery, or [ASVAB](https://www.military.com/join-armed-forces/asvab),
    an SAT-style quiz to measure a potential recruit's academic ability.

- en: A 50 on the test is a relatively low score, with 31 being the minimum to qualify
    for service. Combat arms jobs such as infantrymen and cavalry scouts need only
    minimal scores to serve, while admin work such as a human resources specialist
    or public affairs require scores of 100 or higher.

    school yet at the age of 17 with parental consent. Those recruits typically wouldn't
    ship to basic training until they completed school.

    its tattoo rules](https://www.military.com/daily-news/2022/06/23/army-relaxes-tattoo-rules-it-scrambles-new-recruits.html),
    allowing potential recruits to enlist with tattoos on their hands and neck, which
    previously needed waivers.

    generous benefits and policy tweaks](https://www.military.com/daily-news/2022/05/13/bigger-bonuses-pentagons-top-weapon-combat-recruiting-crisis-troops-head-exits.html)
    in an effort to improve recruiting numbers. The Army has hit 40% of its recruiting
    goals this year, with the struggle to fill the ranks seemingly so grim the Defense
    Department reduced its planned total force size because prior recruiting goals
    were out of reach.

    job market, with employers offering increased wages and benefits even for entry-level
    jobs.
