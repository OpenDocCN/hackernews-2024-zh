    of interactive personal computing on a very expensive machine. Bolt and Beranek
    did not say no. Rather, they said yes, bought a machine, and found a way to fund
    the project through a grant from the Ford Foundation. The long research report
    — later turned into a book — by Licklider and other BBNers titled, “Libraries
    of the Future” was far more than it seems. The report did more than just carry
    out a forward-looking analysis by information researchers and engineers assessing

    firm’s expertise in early computing systems — built up by contract research projects
    as well as the team’s pre-existing experience at places like Lincoln Lab — allowed
    it to push technology areas forward in a self-funded way. For example, in the
    1960s the firm designed, implemented, and maintained one of the first commercial
    time-sharing systems for non-engineers. The project gave Massachusetts General
    Hospital a time-sharing system. The system allowed the hospital to handle patient
    administration in a modern way and automate some of the data analysis in their
    research. This, of course, was not the first time-sharing system. But projects

    1960 年代，该公司设计、实施并维护了一种面向非工程师的首批商用分时系统之一。该项目为马萨诸塞州的一般医院提供了一个分时系统。该系统使医院能够以现代方式处理患者管理，并自动化一些研究中的数据分析。当然，这并不是第一个分时系统。但是像这样的项目使

    BBN was not started as a computing research firm. Bolt and Beranek were not computer

    several courses of research that were largely funded by the Navy. Faculty and

    the academic year and left weekends, holidays, and summers entirely free to the
    professors for contract work. Professors could wholeheartedly spend their time
    on contract work with close to zero red tape or permission required from MIT.
    Unlike places like Harvard — and most universities — the Institute, in this era,
    encouraged this double life for its professors. Negligible amounts of paperwork
    and permission-asking were involved. MIT saw no more suitable activity for faculty
    at a professionally-focused institute of technology than to ply their craft for
    paying customers. In doing so, professors simultaneously kept up with industry
    trends, solved industry’s problems, learned how to keep their university research

    had been deeply involved with computers at MIT through his affiliation with Lincoln
    Lab computing projects as well as interactions with Wes Clark and other early

    was becoming an evangelist for work we would now categorize as human-computer
    interaction. But Licklider may have grown expensive more quickly than Beranek
    anticipated. As contracts and know-how were gradually building up in the computing

    Baruch, one of BBN’s partners, was doing acoustics work for the Clinical Center

    staff. During his weekly trips to the NIH, Baruch would go to the home of the
    Clinical Center’s Director, Jack Masur, for gin and jelly beans. On one of these
    evening visits the topic of computing in healthcare came up because Masur was
    asked to give a speech on the topic. Baruch seized the opportunity and shared
    his vision for the possibilities of computers with patient medical records. Masur
    used many of Baruch’s ideas in his speech. After the speech was a hit, Masur phoned
    Baruch and told him, “You should go do it.” Masur recommended Baruch apply for
    a grant from the NIH’s Division of General Medicine to build the system. BBN did.

    Everything I did was useless to the rest of the world, because it was on the TX-2
    and it was a unique machine. So unless the software was transportable, the only
    thing it was useful for was written technical papers, which was a very slow process.
    So, what I concluded was that we had to do something about communications, and
    that really, the idea of the galactic network that Lick talked about, probably
    more than anybody, was something that we had to start seriously thinking about.

    own ARPA contracts to perform some amount of set-up, debugging, and research on
    their own end. The IMP contractor would be in charge of building IMPs that would
    be able to interface with most of the large computers at the time — which were
    not built to be interoperable. This IMP contractor also had to make sure that
    IMPs could communicate across noisy telephone lines, across thousands of miles,

    grew. The Network Measurement Center was run by Leonard Kleinrock at UCLA — the
    first node of the ARPAnet — and was responsible for taking a variety of measurements
    to study the network. The Network Measurement Center was, to Heart, somewhat academic

    BBN had no manufacturing facilities. Thus, they needed to contract with a computer
    manufacturer to have an IMP of their design actually built. At the time, few computer
    manufacturers did this. A standard company’s manufacturing process was not built
    to do wholly custom jobs. The processes were suited to be fiddled with, but not
    much more than that. But Honeywell had recently acquired a company called the
    Computer Control Corporation (CCC) that made them an exception. The team from
    CCC, as Heart put it, “understood a bit about the special systems business.” This
    was a unique enough skill that at least two contract bidders had used Honeywell

    of the output circuit corresponding to the minimum delay path to each other IMP,
    and a corresponding estimate of the delay. Periodically, each IMP sends its current
    routing estimates to its neighbors; whenever an IMP receives such a message it
    updates its internal estimates. Thus, information about changing conditions is
    regularly propagated throughout the network, and whenever a packet of traffic
    must be placed on the queue for an output circuit, the IMP uses its latest estimate
    of the best path.

  zh: BBN与霍尼韦尔的很多交互可能会让人对一个行业参与者能否像BBN那样有效地执行这项合同产生一些疑问。奥恩斯坦提到的BBN团队处理一个令人困惑的问题的情况将有助于阐明为什么会出现这种情况。这个故事既揭示了在实施阶段之前BBN人员在研究时间上究竟在做些什么，又揭示了霍尼韦尔是如何处理问题的。奥恩斯坦解释道：
- en: They were not used to doing some of the kinds of things we were doing…For example,
    we discovered some design flaws in the machine. One of the reasons we chose the
    Honeywell 516 was that we thought it was a mature machine…that was not going to
    gives us grief. Well, we were wrong. We pushed it very hard…and we uncovered a
    bug that they could hardly believe, a synchronizer problem…Synchronizer problems
    are very, very subtle. We had to dig and dig and dig at them, and finally from
    their back room they produced a really smart enough guy — they do have a few —
    but, it was very hard to get this guy. We finally got him…when he came and we
    sat down and I finally had someone I could talk to who would understand what I
    was talking about and believe me. It was a subtle problem. The program would run
    fine in the machine for days on end, and at the end of three or four days suddenly
    the machine would just die, inexplicably. It was a very, very low frequency failure,
    so infrequent that you could never look at it on a scope; you could only see the
    effects afterwards. In fact, we had to build special hardware that beat on the
    trouble spot many, many times faster than normal usage would. Then finally, with
    all the lights out in the room, we could faintly see on the tracing scope an occasional
    failure. That was when the Honeywell people finally became convinced that there
    was a real problem…We showed them the trivial fix they could make to the machine…So,
    their people weren't absolutely top-notch people; they were okay. They were industrial-strength
    people, not research-strength people.

    —— 他们确实有一些 —— 但是，很难找到这个人。我们终于找到了他……当他来了，我们坐下来，我终于有了一个能够理解我说的话并相信我的人。这是一个微妙的问题。程序在机器中连续运行几天都没有问题，但是在三四天后，突然间机器就莫名其妙地死了。这是一个非常非常低频的故障，频率如此之低，以至于你无法用示波器观察到它；你只能在事后看到影响。事实上，我们不得不构建特殊的硬件，比正常使用快很多倍地击打故障点。然后，当房间里的所有灯都熄灭时，我们才能隐约看到示波器上偶尔出现的故障。那时霍尼韦尔的人终于相信有一个真正的问题……我们向他们展示了他们可以对机器进行的微小修复……因此，他们的人员并不是绝对顶尖的人员；他们还好。他们是工业实力的人，不是研究实力的人。

    team was great at reproducing duplicate machines once they had already made one.
    But there were certain computer engineering principles and skills utilized in
    the project that some of the builders — from places like Lincoln Lab and Wes Clark’s

    on the front; how do you put a trailer on the back. There was theory of how you
    put error-correcting codes on it. Bob Kahn knew that theory and told us what it
    was. There were some constraints: this is the way that the 303 (or the 301 or

    finished IMPs to the host sites, BBN even went as far as to have staff ride alongside
    the machines on the plane, just in case. For these early sites, Ornstein and some
    of the software researchers like Dave Walden traveled to the sites to hook the
    IMP up to the phone lines and work through any setup issues. In the lead-up to
    BBN sending the machines, the firm shared a set of specs with the host sites so

    the software working on the machines. In this way, the first batch of nodes became
    operational and steadily improved. BBN did this on budget and within the one-year

    and the primary driver of the engineering work, but ARPA was the high level manager.
    This entire operation, the ARPAnet itself, was meant to facilitate new capabilities
    for ARPAnet contractors. So, Roberts providing a constant guiding hand made sense.
    Also, the ARPA contracting community contained some of the best minds who could
    make technical suggestions to the BBN team. So, Roberts and ARPA continually facilitated
    meetings between BBN, node contractors, and others as they saw fit. The now-famous
    Network Working Group which debated many ARPAnet-relevant ideas, like what later

    Roberts could technically “pull rank” on BBN as the project’s funder. But the
    arrangement did not really work like that. If Roberts didn’t agree with the team’s
    approach to a particular problem, they would discuss it over the phone or in person

- en: 'Walden: …it almost immediately became obvious to anybody who hadn''t believed
    it before that what we had originally implemented was insufficient. And what we
    had specified to the host and what they had implemented had a lot of ramifications.
    They were now done and now it didn''t work all that well. So for the first year
    or two years, quite a long time, there were rules, informal rules in the network
    that you didn''t pump stuff into it from the hosts so fast it swamped the net.
    Because we all knew the algorithms didn''t work, I mean they broke, patently they
    broke when you pumped stuff at them too hard. And so this interim solution worked
    in that network — this is the kind of thing that somebody who is working on proving
    programs correct and stuff can''t imagine. It actually was quite useful in those
    early days of experimentation because everyone agreed not to break it. You know
    how to break it; let''s not break it. Meanwhile, let''s go figure out how to fix
    it…'

    shift, and one the midnight shift. Through BBN’s and the NCC’s efforts, nodes
    were soon able to (in most cases) automatically report their status. Maintenance
    and debugging were then typically carried out remotely from the monitoring center.

- en: Additionally, as the network expanded BBN conducted research in an attempt to
    expand the types of IMP technology as well as the types of communication lines
    IMPs could be hooked up to. In 1971, BBN finished designing its first terminal
    interface message processor (TIP). These terminals were able to connect to the
    ARPAnet and do work on ARPAnet host machines without having to be run on a host
    computer of their own. On their own, TIPs were more expensive than IMPs. But the
    idea was extremely exciting to ARPA because the TIPs becoming operational meant
    one could hook up to the ARPAnet without having a large computer on hand. The
    first two TIPs, shown below, were installed at MITRE and NASA’s AMES research
    facility. The early 1970s saw the first TIPs installed, IMPs connecting to the
    network via satellite technology, the design of standard IMPs ten times more powerful
    than the initial ones, and the deployment of Ornstein’s Pluribus multi-processor
    IMP.

    on stable footing. So, responsibility for the project was transferred to the Defense
    Communications Agency (DCA). According to DARPA Historian Richard Van Atta, at
    the time the project was transferred to DCA the total budget outlays throughout

    The firm’s hospital time-sharing work is just one example of BBN managing an implementation
    project with cutting-edge technology. A project at BBN could start in the deeply
    exploratory research stage and naturally scale into a utility.

  zh: 此外，BBN还拥有必要的员工、经验和结构来管理不断扩展到更大实施项目的成功项目。公司的医院时间共享工作只是BBN利用先进技术管理实施项目的一个例子。在BBN，一个项目可以从深入探索性研究阶段开始，自然地扩展为实用工具。
- en: The ARPAnet project showcased exactly what BBN was optimized to do. When given
    the right kind of problem and the right situation, BBN’s model could help facilitate
    marvelous feats. The ARPAnet itself, just like Edison’s light bulb 90 years prior,
    proved to be both a field-changing test bed for scientific experiments as well
    as a world-changing commercial technology. BBN was ideally suited to make a breakthrough
    of this nature possible. While the mission creep that comes with a profit motive
    can often steer a commercial firm off of the course of truly ambitious research,
    BBN was less susceptible to this in these years. If its research somehow became
    too derivative, the firm would not have been able to recruit staff anywhere near
    the competence level it sought.

  zh: ARPAnet项目完美展示了BBN的优化功能。在遇到适当类型的问题和适当的情况时，BBN的模型能够帮助促进奇迹般的成就。ARPAnet本身，就像90年前爱迪生的电灯泡一样，证明既是科学实验的领域改变试验平台，也是世界变革的商业技术。BBN非常适合实现这种性质的突破。虽然商业公司由于盈利动机而带来的任务扩展往往会偏离真正雄心勃勃的研究路线，但在这些年里，BBN对此不太容易受到影响。如果其研究在某种程度上变得过于衍生，公司将无法招募到符合其所寻求的能力水平的员工。
- en: If every scientific/commercial area had a small research firm *like* BBN, the
    scope of what would become possible with an ARPA-like PM’s funding would expand
    greatly. In one’s role as a PM, if the opportunity to help incentivize or facilitate
    an organization to operate a little more like BBN, there seem to be few downsides
    — and massive upside — to do so. The more novel a systems contract becomes, the
    more suitable it is for a firm *like* BBN.

  zh: 如果每个科学/商业领域都有一个像 BBN 这样的小型研究公司，那么在类似 ARPA 的 PM 资助下所可能实现的范围将大大扩展。作为 PM，如果有机会帮助激励或促进一个组织更像
    BBN 运作，似乎几乎没有不利之处，而且有巨大的好处。系统合同变得越新颖，像 BBN 这样的公司就越适合。
- en: 'BBN created such a compelling, applied environment in which to do research
    that they convinced many professors to give up tenured positions at MIT to come
    work at the firm. The firm knew exactly how to make use of these bright, applied
    researchers. Dave Walden put extreme emphasis on how much the “native wit” of
    the initial technical team he joined — Frank Heart, Severo Ornstein, and Will
    Crowther — was required to make the project a success, saying:'

  zh: BBN 创建了一个引人入胜的应用环境，让许多教授放弃了在 MIT 的终身职位来到公司工作。公司确切地知道如何利用这些聪明的、应用研究人员。戴夫·沃尔登非常强调他所加入的最初技术团队——弗兰克·哈特、塞维罗·奥恩斯坦和威尔·克劳瑟——的“本地智慧”是使项目成功所必需的，他说：
- en: They are smart guys. There wasn't much theory in how you build a packet switching
    network. There was a communications theory, but that was all pretty abstract.
    One just got out there and did it. All the stuff that is now taught in courses
    in communications about networks and protocols and all of that, I would say we
    were mainly (as part of the entire community of the host people) inventing it.
    The academic analysis tended to come later in a lot of cases.

  zh: 最后，我将用弗兰克·哈特在《创新文化》中对该组织的深情描述来结束：
- en: First and foremost, BBN was a great place for a technical person to work, and
    most people really liked working there. It was a middle ground between academia
    and the commercial world, with the meritocracy and individual freedom of the academic
    world, along with the potential reward structure and potential impact on the world
    of commercial ventures. In the case of the ARPAnet and the subsequent explosion
    of network activity, it was an extremely unusual opportunity for a technical person
    to “ride a rocket” of change in the world.”

  zh: 首先，BBN 是一个技术人员工作的好地方，大多数人都很喜欢在那里工作。它是学术界和商业世界之间的中间地带，具有学术世界的择优和个人自由，以及商业风险和对世界的潜在影响的奖励结构。在
    ARPAnet 和随后的网络活动激增的情况下，对于一个技术人员来说，这是一个极不寻常的机会去“搭乘”世界变化的“火箭”。”
