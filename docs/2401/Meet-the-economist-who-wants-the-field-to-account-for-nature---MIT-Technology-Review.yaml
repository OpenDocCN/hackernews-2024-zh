    Natural Capital Project assisted in establishing a conservation plan for the Caribbean
    Gulf of Morrosquillo and its hinterlands. The region’s Rio Sinú is an essential
    source of drinking water for many downstream communities but also originates in
    an area that depends upon logging, ranching, and agriculture for its financial
    security. Using InVEST, Daily and her team were able to determine the actual cost
    of silt deposition in the river, particularly for drinking water and hydropower,
    and the value of maintaining upstream forests that would prevent that congestion
    from occurring.

    forest in ways they hadn’t necessarily realized,” says Lisa Mandle, lead scientist
    and director of science-software integration for the Natural Capital Project.
    “We can never capture the total value of a forest in terms of cultural and spiritual
    values or even biodiversity, but we can say that it has measurable economic values
    across dimensions that have not been considered before.”

    to think about how to support the communities within that crucial forest.

    determine their gross ecosystem product, or GEP. Modeled after the gross domestic
    product, the GEP index allows nations to determine the monetary value of their
    ecological systems. Daily and her team piloted this index in 2014 on both municipal
    and national scales in China, and it was adopted by the United Nations Statistical
    Commission in 2021.

    performance metrics, our current ‘Great Degradation’ of natural capital is making
    it imperative that we track ecological performance and use that information to
    guide investments in revitalization and regeneration,” says Daily, who predicts
    that the GEP metric will be employed globally within the next decade.

    assessments in a way that makes the final analysis and visualization easier for
    political leaders, investors, and local communities to use. Making that information
    more accessible, she says, will be crucial for fostering a cultural shift toward
    recognizing humanity’s dependence upon the biosphere.

    the making. And it couldn’t have become reality without Daily’s vision, says Qingfeng
    Zhang, a senior director at the Asian Development Bank, which now includes a Natural
    Capital Lab inspired and supported by the Stanford project. This initiative, which
    was launched in 2020, created a platform for the bank to promote sustainable finance
    with the help of tools that Daily and her team developed.

    public policy has been monumental,” says Zhang. “Her InVEST model and GEP concept
    are transforming the way governments, corporations, and civil society look at
    nature. We now have a tangible economic basis to invest in protecting and growing
    nature.”
