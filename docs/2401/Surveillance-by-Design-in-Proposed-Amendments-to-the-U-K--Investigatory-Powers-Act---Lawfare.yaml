    moving rapidly through the U.K. Parliament that poses a significant threat to
    data security and privacy in the U.K. and beyond. It is ill considered and should
    be amended substantially before it moves forward.

    This piece focuses on certain elements that we think will stifle innovation and
    substantially hinder the efforts of private companies to enhance, or even maintain,
    core security and privacy products, features, and architecture, especially with
    respect to the use of encryption. To be sure, governments in democratic countries
    face challenges in accessing the content of communications of spies, terrorists,
    and other threat actors. They need help. But these purported solutions in the
    bill aren’t the right way to do it.

    Act](https://www.gchq.gov.uk/information/investigatory-powers-act) would give
    the U.K. government, at the sole discretion of the secretary of state for the
    Home Department (Home Office), the power to require a company to tell the U.K.
    government about new or changed products or features before the company could
    launch them. This mandate could be issued without consultation with privacy regulators
    or others in a position to opine on proportionality or other considerations, much
    less a judicial review.

    [called](https://www.parallelparliament.co.uk/debate/2023-12-11/lords/lords-chamber/investigatory-powers-amendment-bill-hl)),
    the U.K. government could use existing powers to require that the company meet
    surveillance capability demands as a condition of making a product or feature
    available. Demands are left to the discretion of the government and could include,
    for example, disabling security like encryption, user access controls, and privacy
    protection features. If the government’s demands are not met, the company may
    have no choice but to abandon the product or feature launch, giving the government
    essentially a veto power on how companies innovate and improve their products.
    (The government could even block a company from deprecating a service or deleting
    data.) All of this is done secretly, with the company prohibited from disclosing
    it unless the government allows it to do so. The act purports to extend enforceability
    to non-U.K. companies, and the amendments expand that to retention and these notices,
    exacerbating the challenges that companies face. Paired with the gag order that
    comes with each, this has several effects, including that the non-U.K. company
    can’t notify its home government of the demand, even one that violates the law
    of the home government, preventing any sort of diplomatic assistance.

    that the purpose of the amendments is to “ensure continuity of lawful access to
    data against a background of changing technology.” It’s understandable that the
    U.K. intelligence and law enforcement agencies would like to know about a company’s
    research and business plans, and have a say in whether and how a company makes
    a change that has serious implications for their weighty missions. Both of us
    have worked in law enforcement, and we know how important, and how difficult,
    the jobs of public safety officials are. There’s no reason to think that the intentions
    behind the bill are anything but noble. This proposed power, however, goes too
    far and is counterproductive.

    problem. Most providers are quite transparent about product launches, feature
    additions, and removals. Many companies have entire conferences to loudly trumpet
    what is coming, or at least issue announcements through blog posts and press releases.
    In addition, there’s no shortage of dialogue between the U.K. government and technology
    providers. In October 2023, U.K. security officials and their Five Eyes partners
    (the United States, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand) made a high-level and
    [highly publicized](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ikh3ncJZPTU) [visit](https://www.fbi.gov/news/press-releases/fbi-hosts-five-eyes-summit-to-launch-drive-to-secure-innovation-in-response-to-intelligence-threats)

    technology companies in Palo Alto, California, [to discuss](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2023-10-18/five-eyes-spy-summit-asio-cia-fbi-san-francisco/102984976)
    [a range of security topics](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2023-10-18/five-eyes-spy-summit-asio-cia-fbi-san-francisco/102984976),
    including espionage threats from China. On top of there being no clear problem
    to solve, the amendments could chill companies from engaging with the government
    in this otherwise healthy exchange about technological innovations for fear of
    enticing the government to issue a notification notice. The open cooperative dynamic
    is at risk of being replaced by one that is defensive and adversarial.

    users around the world. A company that ultimately must capitulate to the surveillance
    demands of the government may end up offering services that are less secure generally,
    susceptible to compromise by bad actors, state sponsored or otherwise. Perhaps
    as a result, the U.K. will have its narrow surveillance needs met at a particular
    moment in time, but this would come at a great cost to those users specifically,
    and cybersecurity generally. One of us has [testified](https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/committee-activity/hearings/reforming-the-electronic-communications-privacy-act)
    to Congress and one [written](https://www.lawfaremedia.org/article/rethinking-encryption)
    at length about the importance, for example, of encryption in enhancing cybersecurity
    for society, while also working to [find](https://carnegieendowment.org/2019/09/10/moving-encryption-policy-conversation-forward-pub-79573)
    a more effective path forward for everyone. This bill, if enacted, could easily
    be used to stifle the increased use of encryption to protect data security and
    privacy.

    for countries less steeped in the rule of law and with a lower regard for human
    rights. Should the current version of the amendments pass, even if U.K. authorities
    adhere in exemplary fashion to human rights and privacy concerns, other security
    services, especially in authoritarian-leaning countries, will not. They could
    endeavor to replicate the U.K.’s secretive power in order to undermine product
    security for their own aims, not only to surveil users but also to censor their
    communications. No country should expect it will necessarily be the beneficiary
    of the use of this new power to control and direct product development. It’s purportedly
    designed for use by the U.K. and for the U.K., though resulting insecurities will
    be there for any actor to exploit if they can find them.

    by numerous governments—including the U.K.—to urge the private sector to find
    better ways to substantially enhance cybersecurity on a more sustainable basis.
    Instead of doing that, the bill, as currently drafted, jeopardizes data security
    and privacy in pursuit of an understandable goal of helping law enforcement and
    intelligence agencies’ legitimate objectives. But no one needs a law that could
    limit future progress on much-needed security enhancements, such as through the
    increased use of encryption. The bill needs to be fixed.
