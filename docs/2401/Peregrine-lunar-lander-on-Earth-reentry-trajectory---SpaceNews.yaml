- en: WASHINGTON — Astrobotic says its Peregrine spacecraft, unable to land on the
    moon because of a propellant leak, will instead reenter the Earth’s atmosphere
    in the coming days.

- en: In [an update posted on social media Jan. 13](https://twitter.com/astrobotic/status/1746260132269379995),
    Astrobotic said it has been monitoring the trajectory of Peregrine over the last
    several days. Its Vulcan Centaur launch placed it on a highly elliptical orbit
    that took out beyond the orbit of the moon, with the original intent of swinging
    back around the Earth before going out to, and entering orbit around, the moon.

    have been adding uncertainty to predictions of the vehicle’s trajectory,” the
    company said in a statement. “Our latest assessment now shows the spacecraft is
    on a path towards Earth, where it will likely burn up in the Earth’s atmosphere.”

    analysts, using available tracking data, estimate a reentry late Jan. 18 near
    Australia.

    late Jan. 14 that it would allow the spacecraft to reenter rather than attempt
    a maneuver with its remaining fuel.

    Government on the most safe and responsible course of action to end Peregrine’s
    mission. The recommendation we have received is to let the spacecraft burn up
    during re-entry in Earth’s atmosphere,” the company stated. “As such, we have
    made the difficult decision to maintain the current spacecraft’s trajectory to
    re-enter the Earth’s atmosphere. By responsibly ending Peregrine’s mission, we
    are doing our part to preserve the future of cislunar space for all.”

    Jan. 8\. The company believes that a valve in a helium pressurization system failed
    to close after an initial test, causing an overpressurization of an oxidizer tank.
    That ruptured the tank, creating the leak.

- en: While Astrobotic initially said estimated the spacecraft would run out of propellant,
    and thus be unable to maintain the proper attitude for its solar panels to generate
    power, within a couple of days, the spacecraft continues to operate. The company
    said Jan. 11 [it had powered on 10 payloads on the spacecraft](https://spacenews.com/astrobotic-gets-payloads-working-on-ailing-peregrine-lander/),
    including four provided by NASA’s Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS) program.

    the teams’ top priority,” Astrobotic said in its Jan. 13 update. The company said
    in its Jan. 14 update that the spacecraft has enough propellant to maintain its
    attitude and “perform small maneuvers” through the end of the mission.
