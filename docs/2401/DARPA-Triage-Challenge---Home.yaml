- en: The DARPA Triage Challenge (DTC) will use a series of challenge events to spur
    development of novel physiological features for medical triage. The DARPA Triage
    Challenge aims to drive breakthrough innovations in identification of “signatures”
    of injury that will help medical responders perform scalable, timely, and accurate
    triage. Of particular interest are mass casualty incidents (MCIs), in both civilian
    and military settings, when medical resources are limited relative to the need.

    as uncrewed aircraft vehicles (UAVs) or robots, and algorithms that analyze sensor
    data in real-time to identify casualties for urgent hands-on evaluation by medical
    personnel.

    by non-invasive contact sensors placed on casualties and algorithms that analyze
    sensor data in real-time to predict need for life-saving.

- en: Since the time of Napoleon, the principles of triage for war casualties have
    involved prioritizing casualties for treatment in accordance with the gravity
    of injury and urgency for medical care, regardless of rank or nationality. These
    principles have withstood the test of time, however there is potential that modern
    science can greatly improve the speed and accuracy of triage.

- en: The nature and scale of a massive casualty event will affect the care that can
    be delivered and the time to care delivery. For very large scale events, only
    those treatments provided by casualties themselves or bystanders already on scene
    are likely to be delivered quickly enough to affect survival, and advances are
    needed to augment their capabilities. By contrast, in more limited events, time
    is of the essence to rapidly identify those casualties with critical but survivable
    injuries in order to delivery maximal lifesaving interventions as quickly as possible.

- en: With this new challenge, DARPA will update the way we perform the triage of
    mass casualties on the battlefield or in the civilian setting. By deploying remote
    technologies, we can better ensure that we get the right patients to the right
    level of care in the right time. I look forward to learning if “triage signatures”
    can deliver on their promise.

- en: We are not prepared for a catastrophic mass casualty event. Accurate triage
    is difficult in any setting, but particularly after a mass casualty incident that
    involves dozens, hundreds, or even thousands of patients. Humans alone struggle
    under the chaos and stress - research has found that in mass casualty settings
    recommended triage methods are often not used or inaccurately applied. DARPA’s
    work to bring technology to triage to improve the capacity and accuracy of triage
    in both the battlefield and civilian settings is critical to improve our Nation’s
    preparedness.
