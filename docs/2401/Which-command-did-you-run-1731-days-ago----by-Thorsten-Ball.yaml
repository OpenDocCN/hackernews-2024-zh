    so this time, let’s talk about shell history.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: On one of my machines the `~/.zsh_history` file contains 26278 commands. Its
    oldest entry was recorded on April 25, 2019\. When I hit `Ctrl-r` in ZSH [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf)
    pops up and lets me fuzzy-search through all 26278 commands, through the last
    5 years of my shell history. It’s glorious.

- en: That one `curl` command with these four strange HTTP headers that I had to send
    to make sure I could talk to my local dev env correctly through the reverse-proxy
    – that’s in there, a few keystrokes and some hazy memories away. That one `rsync`
    that uses the correct SSH client binary on the other side and that preserves timestamps
    and permission – also in there. The ugly bastard of a command that combined `git
    grep` with `find` and 8 ugly incantations of AWK chained together – locked in
    there too. The test command I ran yesterday is as reachable as the one command
    with 12 `&&` in it that I ran 3 years ago, all thanks to a long shell history
    file.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'Truly: `~/.zsh_history` is one of the most important files on my machine. I
    make use of it tens of times every day, whenever I hit `Ctrl-r`. If I wasn’t such
    a doofus it would contain even more than 26278 commands, because I’ve been keeping
    a long shell history for nearly a decade. But since I *am* such a doofus, I forgot
    to back it up (or deleted the backup too early) a few times and hence the `~/.zsh_history`
    on the machine I’m typing this only contains 1034 commands.'

    save it to a script?” And to that I say: look, man, if I knew in advance which
    command would turn out to be important, then we wouldn’t be here, because I’d
    already have ascended to the astral realm.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'Also: why *would* I record it in a script if I can just configure my shell
    to keep track of all of those commands for me? It’s cheap, it’s fast, there’s
    essentially no downsides to it: the largest `~/.zsh_history` I have is 2MB and
    I can fuzzy-search through it in *milliseconds*.'

    you put the number in your rc-file you think: that’s ridiculous, why would I need

    need to get a fuzzy-finder fuzzy-finder to search through it.'

    out for the last few weeks and have come to love. It’s a drop-in enhancement of
    your shell’s history functionality and not only gives you everything I described
    above – incredibly long shell history and fuzzy-search through it – but also syncing
    and backup (yup, need that) of shell history across multiple machines, filtering
    commands by machine, working-directory-specific history and probably 13 other
    things I forgot. It’s *very* nice. Highly recommend it.
