- en: Updated Microsoft sent yet another problematic patch into the wild this week
    in the form of KB5034441\. However, rather than deal with a BitLocker vulnerability,
    the patch is failing to install for some users.

- en: The [patch](https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/topic/kb5034441-windows-recovery-environment-update-for-windows-10-version-21h2-and-22h2-january-9-2024-62c04204-aaa5-4fee-a02a-2fdea17075a8),
    released on January 9, was meant to address a vulnerability that allowed attackers
    to bypass BitLocker encryption by using the Windows Recovery Environment (WinRE).
    It was released for Windows 10 21H2 and 22H2 but appears to have been subject
    to Microsoft's legendary quality control.

    `0x80070643` error, a generic failure message. Unfortunately, according to Microsoft,
    "because of an error in the error code handling routine," this might not be the
    correct error. The actual error could be one related to the recovery partition
    not being large enough: "Windows Recovery Environment servicing failed. (CBS_E_INSUFFICIENT_DISK_SPACE)."'

    not have a recovery partition large enough to handle the update, something Microsoft
    tacitly acknowledged in [KB5028997](https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/topic/kb5028997-instructions-to-manually-resize-your-partition-to-install-the-winre-update-400faa27-9343-461c-ada9-24c8229763bf)
    with instructions for how to resize the partition.
  prefs: []

- en: These instructions are not for the faint of heart. The first link requires the
    user to open a command prompt window with administrative privileges. It's downhill
    from there as users are directed to fire off commands to disable the WinRE before
    deleting and recreating recovery partitions. It's a risky process, with plenty
    of potential for the unwary to make mistakes.

    be concealed by the erroneous install failure error `0x80070643` – to have a go
    at the procedure to manually resize the partition to deal with the problem.
