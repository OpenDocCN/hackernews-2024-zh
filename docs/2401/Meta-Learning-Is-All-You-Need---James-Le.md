# Meta-Learning Is All You Need — James Le

> 来源：[https://jameskle.com/writes/meta-learning-is-all-you-need](https://jameskle.com/writes/meta-learning-is-all-you-need)

Neural networks have been highly influential in the past decades in the machine learning community, thanks to the rise of computing power, the abundance of unstructured data, and the advancement of algorithmic solutions. However, it is still a long way for researchers to completely use neural networks in real-world settings where the data is scarce and requirements for model accuracy/speed are critical.

**Meta-learning**, also known as *learning how to learn*, has recently emerged as a potential learning paradigm that can learn information from one task and generalize that information to unseen tasks proficiently. During this quarantine time, I started watching lectures on [Stanford’s CS 330 class on Deep Multi-Task and Meta-Learning](http://cs330.stanford.edu/) taught by the brilliant [Chelsea Finn](https://ai.stanford.edu/~cbfinn/). As a courtesy of her lectures, this blog post attempts to answer these key questions:

1.  Why do we need meta-learning?

2.  How does the math of meta-learning work?

3.  What are the different approaches to design a meta-learning algorithm?

**Note:** *The content of this post is largely based on CS330's* [*lecture 1 on problem definitions*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rZtSwNOTQo&list=PLoROMvodv4rMC6zfYmnD7UG3LVvwaITY5&index=1)*,* [*lecture 2 on supervised and black-box meta-learning*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6stKGH6zI8g&list=PLoROMvodv4rMC6zfYmnD7UG3LVvwaITY5&index=2)*,* [*lecture 3 on optimization-based meta-learning*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7otSgpTc0Q&list=PLoROMvodv4rMC6zfYmnD7UG3LVvwaITY5&index=3)*, and* [*lecture 4 on few-shot learning via metric learning*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bc-6tzTyYcM&list=PLoROMvodv4rMC6zfYmnD7UG3LVvwaITY5&index=4)*. They are all accessible to the public.*

## **1 - Motivation for Meta-Learning**

Thanks to the advancement in algorithms, data, and compute power in the past decade, deep neural networks have allowed us to handle unstructured data (such as images, text, audio, video, etc.) very well without the need to engineer features by hand. Empirical research has shown that if neural networks can generalize very well if we feed them large and diverse inputs. For example, [Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762) and [GPT-2](https://openai.com/blog/better-language-models/) have made the wave in the Natural Language Processing research community last year with their wide applicability in various tasks.

However, there is a catch with using neural networks in the real-world setting where:

*   **Large datasets are unavailable**: This issue is common in many domains ranging from classification of rare diseases to translation of rare languages. It is clearly impractical to learn from scratch for each task in these scenarios.

*   **Data has a long tail**: This issue can easily break the standard machine learning paradigm. For example, in the self-driving car setting, an autonomous vehicle can be trained to handle common situations very well, but it often struggles with uncommon situations (such as people jay-walking, animals crossing, traffic lines not working) where humans can easily handle. This can lead to very bad outcomes, such as [the Uber's accident in Arizona](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_of_Elaine_Herzberg) a few years ago.

*   **We want to quickly learn something about a new task without training our model from scratch:** Humans can do this quite easily by leveraging our prior experience. For example, if I know a bit of Spanish, then it should not be too difficult for me to learn Italian, as these two languages are quite similar linguistically.

In this article, I would like to give an introductory overview of meta-learning, which is a learning framework that can help our neural network become more effective in the settings mentioned above. In this setup, we want our network to learn a new task more proficiently - assuming that it is given access to data on previous tasks.

Historically, there have been a few papers thinking in this direction.

*   Back in 1992, [Bengio et al.](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2389122_On_the_Optimization_of_a_Synaptic_Learning_Rule) looked at the possibility of a learning rule that can solve new tasks.

*   In 1997, [Rich Caruana](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1007379606734) wrote a survey about **multi-task learning**, which is a variant of meta-learning. He explained how tasks can be learned in parallel using a shared representation between models and also presented a multi-task inductive transfer notion that uses back-propagation to handle additional tasks.

*   In 1998, [Sebastian Thrun](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/1034-is-learning-the-n-th-thing-any-easier-than-learning-the-first.pdf) explored the problem of **lifelong learning**, which is inspired by the ability of humans to exploit experiences that come from related learning tasks to generalize to new tasks.
