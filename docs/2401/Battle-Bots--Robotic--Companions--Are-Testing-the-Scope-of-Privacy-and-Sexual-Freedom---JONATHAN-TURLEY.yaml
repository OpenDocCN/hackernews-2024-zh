    Pygmalion in the “Metamorphoses*,*” the dynamic of humans and inanimate objects
    has been a part of our literature. In that story, the lonely sculptor created
    his perfect woman out of ivory, only to fall in love with the statue. He prayed
    to Venus to give him a lover like his statue Galatea. She did so, and “the maiden
    felt the kisses, blushed and, lifting her timid eyes up to the light, saw the
    sky and her lover at the same time.”

    are being programmed with more and more human features and lifelike responses. With
    breakthroughs in artificial intelligence, they can respond to questions and even
    display emotions from jealousy to desire. They are developing warm and reflective
    responses to touch.

    the explosion of sexbots. While both male and female bots are available, the consumer
    base for bots remains largely men, and the objections have been almost exclusively
    focused on gynoids, or fembots. For feminists, the sexbots are allowing men to
    objectify women and domination fantasies.

    toaster with a fetching name. Even the term “brothel” can be challenged. In Paris,
    a sex doll brothel was opened and licensed as a “game center.” The analogy is
    based on the fact that bots, in the view of customers, are simply machines designed
    for recreation.

    violence against women. In the case of prostitution, many libertarians argue that
    two consenting adults should be allowed to contract for sex.

    (CREEPER) Act” was notable in its sweeping underlying claims about not only childlike
    robots, but seemingly all robots. “Dolls and robots not only lead to rape, but
    they make rape easier by teaching the rapist how to overcome resistance and subdue
    the victim,” it states. Moreover, it maintains, “Dolls and robots are intrinsically
    related to abuse of minors, and they cause the exploitation, objectification,
    abuse, and rape of minors.”

    In 2002, in Ashcroft v. Free Speech Coalition, the Supreme Court struck down two provisions
    of the [Child Pornography Prevention Act of 1996](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_Pornography_Prevention_Act_of_1996) that
    dealt with virtual or depicted child pornography. That included purely computer-generated
    images where there is no actual child or victim. Both provisions were found to
    violate the First Amendment, and the court rejected the type of assumed harm claimed
    by CREEPER.
