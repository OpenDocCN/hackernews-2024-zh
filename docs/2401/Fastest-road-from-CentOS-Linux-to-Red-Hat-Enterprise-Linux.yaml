    Enterprise Linux 7 (RHEL 7) will be reaching End of Maintenance (EOM). The good
    news is that these events won’t require a complete infrastructure overhaul. Tools
    are available to move from your current configuration to a place where you’ll
    have years of support.

    than you think. Start planning now. Start moving soon. Give yourself plenty of
    runway, and don’t forget that we aren’t just your software vendor at Red Hat.
    We are your partners and are here to help you with these transitions.

- en: In my days as a systems administrator, we didn’t consider in-place conversions
    or upgrades. For one thing, it wasn’t the straightforward process we have today.
    Secondly, new operating systems and hardware retirements went hand in hand. New
    OS? Time for a new server model! There are specific environments where that is
    the case.
  prefs: []

- en: You can certainly buy new hardware (or spin up new cloud instances) on the latest
    versions of RHEL and do a “rip-and-replace,” moving over only your application
    data. But for many, this isn’t an ideal approach. What other options are there?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you want to keep your application on the same version and focus solely on
    the operating system for this project, you can do that too. Look at setting up
    a RHEL 8 or 9 server and running it as a container host for Podman. Put your applications
    into a container, and viola. You can build your applications into pre-built application
    images or [Universal Base Images (UBI)](https://catalog.redhat.com/software/containers/search?vendor_name=Red%20Hat&p=1&q=UBI).

    way. In what amounts to a 2-phase process, we can convert your CentOS Linux systems
    onto a supported version of RHEL and then execute an in-place upgrade.

    and packages you already have running on these systems. An in-place upgrade means
    all that customization doesn’t go away. The other piece of good news is that the
    conversion process and the resulting server image are both supported by Red Hat!
    In other words, if something breaks during or after the conversion, you can open
    a support ticket and get the help you need.

    Lifecycle Support (ELS) subscriptions if that is a path of interest. However,
    these entitlements come with an added cost. For today’s thought exercise, we are
    looking at how to keep your systems feeling fresh (read supported) without added
    expense or the need to rip-and-replace later.
