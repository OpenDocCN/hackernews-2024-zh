  zh: 对人类行为的这种科学解释被认为对我们的惩罚和奖励的概念——简言之，支配我们的道德、法律和经济体系的功绩主义假设——具有巨大的进步意义。例如，它们对我们如何对待暴力犯罪行为和其他反社会行为的从业者具有重要意义。学者，如纽约州立大学科宁分校的哲学家格雷格·卡鲁索，他运营着无报复正义网络，指出了这种神经科学的学术成果，在他努力实现一个更加人道的社会方面，他相信，一旦这些犯罪被视为超出自由意志的范畴，这将成为可能。科学唯物主义者不是将责任归咎于并满足惩罚“坏人”的愿望，而是将预防潜在罪犯未来伤害置于优先位置。改变这些人成长和生活环境的情况，逻辑是，你就创造了一个更加公正的社会。

    or environmental conditions into which they were born? Would such news be a cause
    for celebration regarding the newfound potential to improve these unfortunate
    circumstances and prevent human suffering, or would it be viewed as dangerous,
    a threat to the individual responsibility essential for any decent society? The
    question is not merely hypothetical but raised by the recent publication of a
    new book by Stanford neurobiologist Robert Sapolsky entitled, *[Determined: A

    The culminating achievement of over four decades of research in primate behavior,
    Sapolsky is building upon his award-winning and best-selling work of 2017, *Behave:
    The Biology of Humans at Our Best and Worst*. There he draws on a growing literature,
    which claims that human decisions are capable of strict causal explanation, insofar
    as they are the result of neurological stimuli entirely beyond our control. In
    recent decades, this emerging body of research has argued that the brain—not concepts
    such as the “will,” “reason,” or even “mind”—is the real origin of human action
    in the world, which itself is responding to myriad external causes.'

- en: Such scientific explanations of human behavior are thought to hold the promise
    of tremendous progress with respect to our notions of punishment and reward—in
    short, the meritocratic assumptions governing our moral, legal, and economic systems.
    For example, they have significance for how we treat practitioners of violent
    crime and other anti-social behavior. Scholars, such as Gregg Caruso, a philosopher
    at SUNY Corning who runs the Justice Without Retribution Network, point to such
    neuroscientific scholarship in his effort to bring about a more humane society
    which, he believes, will become possible once such crimes are seen as beyond free
    will. Rather than assigning blame and fulfilling a desire to punish “bad” people,
    such scientific naturalists prioritize the prevention of future harm by would-be
    offenders. Change the circumstances in which such people are raised and live their
    lives, the logic goes, and you create a more just society.

    up and made much, much more unfair by the fact that we reward people and punish
    people for things they have no control over.” However, he argues, “We’ve got no free
    will. Stop attributing stuff to us that isn’t there.” The real victims, on this
    view, are those who could not act other than they did but were thrown into a world
    and unfortunate circumstances in which they could not choose and for which they
    were not responsible. That society punishes such people for their “crimes” merely
    compounds injustice on top of injustice. We are machines, not free agents, and
    it is believed to be incoherent to blame the firing of brain synapses for the
    problems they produce, rather than recognizing their origin in biochemistry—whether
    due to a life of poverty, childhood trauma, or simple genetic inheritance.

  zh: 正如Sapolsky最近告诉《洛杉矶时报》：“世界真的很糟糕，并且由于我们奖励和惩罚人们的事情是他们无法控制的事情而变得更加不公平。”然而，他认为，“我们没有自由意志。别把不存在的东西归因于我们。”在这种观点下，真正的受害者是那些无法做出其他选择但被投入到一个他们无法选择并且不负责任的不幸境遇中的人。对于这样的人，社会因其“犯罪”而惩罚他们，仅仅是在不公正之上又增加了不公正。我们是机器，不是自由的代理者，认为把大脑突触的发射归因于它们产生的问题是不连贯的，而不是认识到它们的根源在于生物化学——无论是由于贫困的生活、童年创伤还是简单的遗传。
- en: However, if there is no free will and all decisions are neurologically determined,
    how could we possibly “stop attributing” praise and blame to human conduct? In
    other words, the lack of freedom or agency that such scientists attribute to human
    behavior must be applied to themselves and those who become cognizant of their
    research no less than the human beings they analyze in society. For such scientists
    are, themselves, within society, not mere external observers of it. Having objectified
    the human beings of their research, behavioralists often lose sight of their own
    involvement and participation in the social world. The philosophical movement
    of the mid-twentieth century known as phenomenology has long identified this epistemological
    problem with scientific naturalism—it succumbs to a “self-forgetting” or “forgetfulness
    of being” of the scientific observer, whose own embeddedness within the social
    order is essentially neglected or forgotten. In the present case, this allows
    for the scientist to exempt himself from the problematic implications of a more
    thoroughgoing and consistent determinism.

  zh: 但是，如果没有自由意志，所有决定都是由神经决定的，我们怎么可能“停止归因”于人类行为的赞扬和责备呢？换句话说，科学家们归因于人类行为的自由或代理权必须同样适用于他们自己以及那些意识到他们研究的人类社会的人。因为这样的科学家们自己也处于社会之中，而不仅仅是社会的外部观察者。行为主义者往往会把他们研究的人类客体化，往往忽视了自己在社会世界中的参与和参与。二十世纪中叶的哲学运动被称为现象学长期以来已经确定了这一科学自然主义的认识论问题——它陷入了科学观察者的“自我遗忘”或“对存在的遗忘”之中，后者本身对社会秩序的内嵌性基本上被忽视或遗忘了。在目前的情况下，这使得科学家得以免除自己免受更为彻底和一致的决定论的问题的影响。

    or “unjust” with regard to human affairs have no place in a world that is said
    to be devoid of free will. For concepts such as justice and injustice, right and
    wrong, are fundamentally dependent on the possibility of acting otherwise. To
    put this differently, once free will has been claimed by neuro-determinists to
    be impossible, the evaluation of our social institutions—e.g. a government’s criminal
    law system, a society’s distribution of wealth—no longer makes sense. Without
    the freedom to make different social or political choices, such institutions are
    simply what happens, unsusceptible to our moral approval or condemnation, since
    they were determined and thus beyond human responsibility. Our punishment of criminals
    for their “bad” behavior, itself, would have to be seen as determined (perhaps
    by a psychological need for retribution, etc). To claim that such policies and
    attitudes are “unfair” absent the ability to act differently is like criticizing
    a rock for falling downward as a result of gravity.

  zh: 此外，必须承认，在一个被认为缺乏自由意志的世界中，“不公平”或“不公正”等价值归属在人类事务中是没有位置的。因为诸如正义和不正义、对与错等概念，根本上取决于能否采取其他行动。换句话说，一旦神经决定论者声称自由意志是不可能的，我们对社会制度的评价——比如政府的刑法体系、一个社会的财富分配——就不再有意义。在没有自由做出不同社会或政治选择的情况下，这些制度只是发生的事情，不受我们的道德认可或谴责，因为它们是被决定的，因此超出了人类的责任范围。我们对罪犯的“坏”行为进行惩罚本身也必须被视为是被决定的（也许是由于对报复的心理需求等）。在没有能力做出不同选择的情况下声称这些政策和态度是“不公平”的，就像批评岩石由于地球引力向下落下一样。
- en: Further difficulties arise for the neuro-determinist when he considers the fact
    that he, himself, is involved in the paradoxical effort to persuade others of
    his position that there is no such thing as free will. For, there is clearly bound
    up in such arguments the assumption that those being reasoned with are free to
    change their minds based on the merits (or demerits) of the evidence presented.
    Good (or bad) scientific evidence is judged on its merits no less than the moral
    and political institutions that scientific naturalists, such as Sapolsky and Caruso,
    are persuading others to alter for their faults. Moreover, the rules of the scientific
    method themselves, quite unlike the rules of human behavior that the scientist
    seeks to discover, are prescriptive, and thus intended to *guide* inquiry that
    might be done well (or poorly) in the study of the natural or social world. This
    would appear to imply willful choices and the responsibility that is attendant
    to them, which accompanies the practice of science and according to which all
    scientists are held accountable. The decisions of the scientist and his peers
    are thus assumed to be free. Once again, such contradictions disappear or are
    obscured only when the scientific naturalist exempts himself (and those he attempts
    to persuade) from the determinism or lack of agency he would ascribe to all human
    beings.

  zh: 对于神经决定论者而言，进一步的困难在于，当他考虑到他自己也参与了努力说服他人接受自己的观点——即没有自由意志这样的事实时，这一事实变得更加明显。因为在这种论证中明显包含了这样一种假设，即被推理的人可以根据所提供的证据的优点（或缺点）改变他们的想法。好（或坏）的科学证据被评判其优点，就像科学唯物主义者（如萨波尔斯基和卡鲁索）说服他人改变其缺陷的道德和政治制度一样。此外，科学方法的规则本身与科学家试图发现的人类行为规则完全不同，它们是规范性的，因此旨在*指导*可能在研究自然或社会世界中做得好（或差）的探究。这似乎暗示着有意识的选择和随之而来的责任，这是科学实践的伴随物，根据这个伴随物，所有的科学家都应该负责。因此，科学家及其同行的决定被认为是自由的。再次，只有当科学唯物主义者免除自己（以及他试图说服的人）所归因于所有人类的决定论或缺乏代理权时，这种矛盾才会消失或被掩盖。
- en: If, however, one calls attention to this incompatibility between the perspective
    assumed by the scientific naturalist and that which he attributes to the human
    beings he studies—the views that are seen as external and internal to the “objects”
    of his investigation—one begins to expose the problems with this approach to human
    understanding. How, for example, would the human beings in society respond to
    the scientist’s claim that their consciousness and behavior are entirely predetermined?
    Such an encounter would bring information from the outside in, as it were, raising
    the conspicuous and problematic question of whether such an engagement should,
    on this account, be regarded as determined or free. Should the introduction of
    such information, then, be seen as part of a causal chain extending back to the
    scientist’s research, which was itself determined? Or should the individuals who
    “respond” to such information regarding their predetermined behavior somehow be
    seen as freer in light of this knowledge? The latter would, it seems, be the implication
    of the suggestion that in light of our awareness of our neurological determinism,
    we should “stop attributing” praise and blame within our moral, legal, and economic
    institutions. Such an admission would certainly raise new (and dizzying) problems
    for the neuro-determinist regarding whether such individuals have acquired agency
    and, seemingly, now deserve to be held accountable for their actions. Regardless,
    the point here is that such a question—no mere thought experiment, since we are
    in fact informed of such research—presses the scientific naturalist to acknowledge
    the sharing of a world between the scientist and the human beings he studies.

- en: The perplexities that arise for a human being who is made “aware” of his predetermined
    behavior is perhaps first worked through in Fyodor Dostoevsky’s literary critique
    of scientism, *Notes from the Underground*. In this work, Dostoevsky’s Underground
    Man demonstrates the epistemological difficulties that result from such objectification
    of the human consciousness and the persistence of the individual’s experience
    of the free will. It is the arbitrary privileging of the external gaze of the
    scientific naturalist over the internal perspective of the human consciousness
    that inspires this tortured account of an individual trying to make sense of his
    objectification and the denial of a freedom that is experienced as real. This
    emphasis within Dostoevsky’s fiction on subjective consciousness and the real
    moral dilemmas confronted by the individual shows the centrality that choice and
    responsibility have to the author’s understanding of reality. Referring to the
    reputation he had received for being a “psychologist,” concerned with the inner
    workings of the conscience, Dostoevsky indicated that he preferred to think of
    himself as a “realist in the higher sense.” The experience of the struggles of
    conscience and the burdens of moral responsibility are, for Dostoevsky, a more
    realistic or authentic account of a human life than one which tries to explain
    everything in terms of what is observable and empirically verifiable from the
    outside.

    thus comes with a cost. It is the exclusion and neglect of the interior realm
    and the reality of a conscience and will that are irreducible to material causes.
    Confronted with a utopian socialism whose own objectification of the individual
    would turn him into an “organ stop” or “piano key,” the Underground Man thus stages
    his rebellion in the name of the life of the spirit. Dostoevsky affirms the status
    of this interior, spiritual realm alongside the laws of the physical universe
    when, in his inner monologue, he explains that it is not the results or satisfaction
    of preferences that give value to human choices but the very process of willing
    or striving itself. His famous statement that “two times two makes five” might
    be just as charming a thing as “two times two makes four” affirms what is valuable
    about the free will even in error. For in the will’s striving is earned the achievement
    of a self, whose being, because more than just a series of temporally fleeting,
    observable events, persists and acquires a character that transcends the flux

- en: 'Dostoevsky’s argument against scientism is a subtle one. He establishes the
    validity of the free will against scientific naturalism by drawing his readers
    into the internal experience of a fictional consciousness and its struggles with
    choice and responsibility, with whom the reader then identifies by virtue of their
    own past experience. Precisely because of the relatability of the internal experience
    of his fictional subject, we are able to see or comprehend the true ground of
    this interior reality: the universality of our spiritual struggle. Unlike the
    scientific naturalist who stands at a distance from the human beings he studies
    through their objectification, the reader of Dostoevsky’s fiction enters into
    a dynamic, interpretive engagement or dialogue with the subject, whose experiences
    are brought into relationship with the reader’s own. This relationship stands
    in contrast to the isolation of the Underground Man, which is clearly a function
    of his objectification and alienation experienced from above. Anticipating phenomenological
    critiques of scientism, *Notes* thus helps to overcome the self-forgetting that
    characterizes modern behavioralism—calling attention to the persons with whom
    relationships can be either developed or severed. And it is the remembrance of
    our own experiences of free will and responsibility, undeniable in their interior
    reality, which his literary encounter evokes.'

  zh: 陀思妥耶夫斯基反对科学主义的论点是微妙的。他通过让读者进入虚构意识的内在体验及其对选择和责任的斗争来证实自由意志对科学自然主义的有效性，读者因其自身过去的经验而与之产生共鸣。正是由于他虚构主体内在体验的可关联性，我们能够看到或理解这一内在现实的真正基础：我们精神斗争的普遍性。与通过客体化研究人类的科学自然主义者不同，陀思妥耶夫斯基小说的读者参与了与主体的动态、解释性的互动或对话，其经历与读者自己的经历联系在一起。这种关系与孤立的地下人形成鲜明对比，后者明显是其客体化和自上而下的异化的功能。《笔记》因此预见到现象学对科学主义的批评，有助于克服表现为现代行为主义特征的自我忘却，引起人们对可以发展或切断关系的人的注意。而正是他文学遭遇唤起了我们对自由意志和责任内在现实的记忆。
