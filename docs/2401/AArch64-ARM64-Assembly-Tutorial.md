# ARMv8 AArch64/ARM64 Full Beginner's Assembly Tutorial

Hello there! My name is ***Vega***. I am a Video Game Cheat Code Developer who loves to write code/programs in various Assembly Languages. This page includes chapters of information that will teach a Beginner about the ARMv8 AArch64/ARM64 Assembly Language. For Beginners who are completely new to Assembly, there seems to be no decent ARMv8 AArch64 Assembly Tutorials on the Web. The tutorials that are present on other sites are tailored for those who are already familiar with an older version of ARM. Granted, ARMv8 AArch64 is not the ideal Assembly Language to learn as someone's first. However, if a true Beginner can learn ARMv8 AArch64, then all other Assembly Languages will be easy work.

Follow all the Chapters in consecutive order. However, there is a Glossary Page linked near the bottom of this page. Feel free to reference that page any time you need to do so. You *must* have a Linux Machine and understand how to run basic Terminal commands (sorry I don't use Windows or Mac). To the Windows and MAC users, the three programs that get installed in this Tutorial are GNU AArch64 Assembler, QEMU, and GNU Debugger. Google results may provide the guides you need to get those installed and running.

I was originally going to make a Nintendo Switch Cheat Code tutorial which would include some sections covering ARMv8 AArch64 for those already familiar with Assembly Languages. However, I decided to make a full-on ARMv8 AArch64 "Beginner to Advanced" Assembly Language Tutorial. Do **not** skim or skip any content. English is not my best language (lol), so if you find any grammatical errors or any incorrect information, please contact me. Discord - vega8365.
