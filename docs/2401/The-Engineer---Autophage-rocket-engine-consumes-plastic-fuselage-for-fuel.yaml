- en: The autophage engine uses waste heat from combustion to sequentially melt its
    own plastic fuselage as it fires. It then feeds the molten plastic into the engine’s
    combustion chamber as additional fuel to burn alongside its regular liquid propellants.

- en: The concept of a self-eating rocket engine was first proposed and patented in
    1938\. However, no autophage engine designs were fired in a controlled manner
    until a research partnership between Glasgow University and Dnipro National University,
    Ukraine achieved this milestone in 2018.

- en: Now, with support from Kingston University, the Glasgow engineers have demonstrated
    that more energetic liquid propellants can be used, and that the plastic fuselage
    can withstand the forces required to feed it into the engine without buckling.

    presented at the international [AIAA SciTech Forum](https://www.aiaa.org/SciTech)
    in Orlando, Florida this week.

- en: In the paper, the team describe how they test-fired their Ouroborous-3 autophage
    engine, producing 100 newtons of thrust in a series of controlled experiments.

- en: The Ouroborous-3 uses high-density polyethylene plastic tubing as its autophagic
    fuel source, burning it alongside the rocket’s mix of gaseous oxygen and liquid
    propane.

- en: The tests showed that the Ourobourous-3 is capable of stable burn throughout
    the autophage stage, with the plastic fuselage supplying up to one-fifth of the
    total propellant used.

- en: The tests also showed that the rocket’s burn could be controlled, with the team
    demonstrating its ability to be throttled, restarted and pulsed in an on/off pattern.

    James Watt School of Engineering said: “These results are a foundational step
    on the way to developing a fully-functional autophage rocket engine. Those future
    rockets could have a wide range of applications which would help advance the UK’s
    ambitions to develop as a key player in the space industry.'

- en: “A conventional rocket’s structure makes up between five and 12 per cent of
    its total mass. Our tests show that the Ouroborous-3 can burn a very similar amount
    of its own structural mass as propellant. If we could make at least some of that
    mass available for payload instead, it would be a compelling prospect for future
    rocket designs.”

    new funding from the UK Space Agency and the Sciences and Technology Facilities
    Council.
