    to a question about the issue from far-right influencer Jackson Hinkle. Musk promised

    “mistake” on X’s spam algorithms. The Hamas account is still suspended.*'

- en: X, the platform formerly known as Twitter, purged an unknown number of prominent
    accounts over the last 24 hours with little to no explanation, and then restored
    the accounts minutes after this article was published. The list includes popular
    accounts belonging to journalists, writers, and podcasters. Among them are Ken
    Klippenstein of the Intercept, writer and podcaster Rob Rousseau, Texas Observer
    correspondent Steven Monacelli, the account for TrueAnon, a left-wing politics
    and news podcast, and a number of others. One thing the accounts have in common
    is recent criticisms of the Israeli government.

    the blatantly racist conspiracy theory](https://gizmodo.com/elon-musk-antisimite-tweet-racist-truth-1851027888)
    that Jews encourage “hatred against whites.” The CEO then embarked on a campaign
    to restore his image, celebrating the Israeli military, denouncing antisemitism,
    and traveling to Israel for an impromptu meeting with Prime Minister Benjamin
    Netanyahu.

    Although I have written multiple critical reports about Twitter/X and Elon Musk
    in recent months,” Monacelli told Gizmodo. “Yes, I have made posts critical of
    Israel’s targeting of civilians and journalists, and have shared news about pro-Palestinian
    protests, but I have also recently made posts and shared news debunking antisemitism
    disguised as criticism of Israel.”

- en: Less than half an hour after this article was published, far-right influencer
    Jackson Hinkle tweeted at Musk, asking him why accounts critical of Israel were
    being suspended. Musk, who has a history of handling customer service questions
    for prominent conservative users, responded.

    is not ok to call for extreme violence, as that is illegal,” Musk [wrote](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1744763197347832062).
    “For the record, I do not personally agree with your views. Nonetheless, the point
    of freedom of speech is allowing those whose views you disagree with to express
    those views.” Shortly thereafter, the accounts were restored.

    movement, [thanked Musk](https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/1744766599830069617)
    for looking into the problem. Musk blamed the suspensions on X’s anti-spam algorithms.

    up in them,” Musk [tweeted](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1744778778381877427).
    In another [tweet](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/with_replies), the billionaire
    wrote, “There are around 600 million active accounts on this platform. Mistakes
    are bound to be made at such a scale, but we try to fix them quickly.”

    Israeli government, and recently concluded a two-part series delving into the
    country’s nuclear weapons program. “Why did Elon ban my podcast account what about
    free speech,” Liz Franczak, co-host of TrueAnon, [wrote](https://twitter.com/liz_franczak/status/1744712132015370527)
    on her personal X account. “Why is the woke mob coming after hard working American
    small businesses?”

    on X. “Had the ban stuck - and I imagine it will eventually - I would’ve just
    migrated to my newsletter.”

    should be banned from X unless they break the law. “Given that Twitter serves
    as the de facto public town square, failing to adhere to free speech principles
    fundamentally undermines democracy,” Musk tweeted in 2022, in the lead-up to buying
    the platform. In reality, Musk has a [long history of silencing his critics](https://gizmodo.com/10-times-elon-musk-censored-twitter-users-1850570720)
    and censoring views he finds disagreeable.

    on automated mistakes. However, @qassam2024, an account tied to Hamas’s military,
    was banned the just one day prior. This was an intentional policy decision, according
    to Musk, unlike the other “mistakes.”

    on X. “While many government leaders, including in the USA, do call for killing
    people, we have a ‘UN exemption rule’; if a government is recognized by the UN,
    we will not suspend their accounts. Hamas is not recognized as a government by
    the UN, so was suspended.”

    the “UN exemption” still applies.

    but they’ve all criticized the Israeli government. Klippenstein, for example,
    recently posted an article on his Substack newsletter noting that Musk discussed
    AI during his November meeting with Netanyahu as the Israeli government used AI
    to bomb Gaza. Klippenstein has also posted critiques of the Israeli government
    and military on X.

    [welcomed them back after public criticism](https://gizmodo.com/elon-musk-twitter-elonjet-banned-private-plane-tracker-1849891785).
    In 2022, Musk rewrote Twitter’s rules in order to ban [@ElonJet](https://gizmodo.com/elon-musk-shadowban-elonjet-private-jet-twitter-1849882446),
    an account that tracked his private jet, and then suspended the accounts of a
    number of journalists who wrote about @ElonJet, including some that had never
    actually discussed it on X. It sparked widespread condemnation, and soon after,
    the accounts were restored, despite the fact that Musk continued to claim they
    violated X’s rules.
