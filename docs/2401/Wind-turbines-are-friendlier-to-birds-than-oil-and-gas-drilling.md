# Wind turbines are friendlier to birds than oil-and-gas drilling

BIRDERS GET nervous when they see landscapes covered in wind turbines. When the wind gets going, their blades can spin at well over 200km per hour. It is easy to imagine careless birds getting chopped to bits. Campaigners often point to the possibility when opposing the building of new wind farms.

No one doubts that wind turbines do indeed kill at least some birds. But a new analysis of American data, published in *Environmental Science & Technology*, suggests the numbers are negligible, and have little impact on bird populations.
