- en: 'My hot take: Google does not have one single visionary leader. Not a one. From
    the C-suite to the SVPs to the VPs, they are all profoundly boring and glassy-eyed.
    Google has not launched one single successful executive-driven thing in years.
    Sometimes, VPs try to decree "we need a new chat app or AI-first demo for I/O!"
    There''s a boondoggle slog, and in the end, the thing is half-baked and roundly
    derided. If it doesn''t get 100 million users in six months, they give up and
    shut it down. It''s like that joke algorithm I learned about in college -- BogoSort.
    In each iteration of the algorithm, you reorder everything randomly and if the
    elements happen to land in order, you are done. Some of Google''s executives are
    competent referees. I couldn''t name which, but I feel like I''ve seen it done
    in my 8+ years. They point in a direction, their subordinates swarm the area,
    try a bunch of stuff, and sometimes something sticks and is cool. Right now, all
    of these boring, glassy-eyed leaders are trying to point in a vague direction
    (AI) while at the same time killing their golden goose. Given that they have no
    real vision of their own, they really need their subordinates to come up with
    cool stuff for them. And at the same time, there have been rolling layoffs for
    the past 6-12 months throughout the company, including engineering, sales, support,
    UX, product, data science, SRE, everything. Just randomly firing people, torching
    institutional knowledge, and blowing up perfectly functional teams. Maybe it''s
    not random. But they refuse to describe their reasons except as "we are excited
    to focus our resources on our highest priorities," so it might as well be random.
    I think they don''t know what the priorities are. Not durably. They are waiting
    for their subordinates to propose concrete stuff in the direction they are waving
    their arms. Meanwhile, all of the mid-level leaders are scrambling to protect
    their teams (and themselves) by guessing what their VPs might find appealing.
    If you are a leader and you guess wrong, you and your team get cut. There is a
    pervasive sense of nihilism that has taken hold. "Well, I guess I will just do
    the job until they fire me." A lot of people have golden handcuffs situations
    and aren''t going to walk away from the salary, but nobody works late anymore.
    The buildings are half empty at 4:30\. I know a lot of people, myself included,
    who used to happily do extra work evenings and weekends to get the demo done or
    just out of boredom. That''s gone. Google really was a magical place, not very
    long ago. And for some reason, executives are cashing out their human capital
    at the very moment it seems to me like they really need it. Who can be dawn-of-a-new-era-of-humanity
    creative in this environment of fear? It''s really sad. I have no way to align
    myself with any unspoken VP strategy or do good enough work to save myself if
    my whole team is cut. So I guess I will just hang around and do my job until Google
    no longer wants me.'
