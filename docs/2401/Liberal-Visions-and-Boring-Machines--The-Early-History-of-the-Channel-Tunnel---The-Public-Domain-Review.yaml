- en: 'In February 1882, excerpts from Wolseley’s memorandum were published in *The
    Nineteenth Century* magazine, and over the following month he and other Army and
    Navy officers proceeded to conduct a coordinated public campaign against the Tunnel.
    In this they were aided by James Knowles, the editor of *The Nineteenth Century*,
    who organised a special edition and petition against the scheme, signed by many
    eminent, if not exactly representative, public figures, including a number of
    prominent liberals such as T. H. Huxley, Herbert Spencer, and fourteen Liberal
    MPs. The accompanying essay by Knowles, a diatribe against selfish “company-promoters”,
    boiled Wolseley’s arguments down to a trinity of terror: a “certainty” of increased
    military expenditure, a “probability” of panics, and “the possibility of an irretrievable
    disaster from invasion”. It was clear that the issue had struck something deep
    within the nervous system of liberal Britain. When it came to the point, many
    did not believe that “the people” would embrace their new continental connection
    in the spirit of universal brotherhood. “The alarmists sign [the petition] because
    they are alarmists”, reflected *The Scotsman*. “The non-alarmists sign because
    they do not wish the country to be alarmed.”'
