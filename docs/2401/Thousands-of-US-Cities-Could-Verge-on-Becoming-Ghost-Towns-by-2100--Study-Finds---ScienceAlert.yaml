    either reshaped by natural forces driven by [climate change](https://www.sciencealert.com/climate-change)

- en: A new study has run the numbers and found that by the end of the century, almost
    half of the nearly 30,000 cities in the US will face some sort of population decline,
    losing between 12 to 23 percent of their resident population.

  zh: 一项新研究对数据进行了分析，发现到本世纪末，美国将近30000个城市中将有近一半面临某种程度的人口下降，居民人口将减少12至23%。
- en: According to the analysis, these future cities are more likely to resemble fractured,
    thinning, or sprawling communities than total ghost towns, as populations shift
    within and between cities. That is, unless local governments and town planners
    can respond and adapt to the changing needs of their residents.
