    either reshaped by natural forces driven by [climate change](https://www.sciencealert.com/climate-change)
    or by humans saving their own skin. Our cities could look totally different too
    – and some might be shadows of their former selves.

- en: A new study has run the numbers and found that by the end of the century, almost
    half of the nearly 30,000 cities in the US will face some sort of population decline,
    losing between 12 to 23 percent of their resident population.

- en: According to the analysis, these future cities are more likely to resemble fractured,
    thinning, or sprawling communities than total ghost towns, as populations shift
    within and between cities. That is, unless local governments and town planners
    can respond and adapt to the changing needs of their residents.

    challenges, possibly leading to disruptions in basic services like transit, clean

    a graduate student in civil engineering at the University of Illinois at Chicago,
    and two colleagues, Lauryn Spearing and Sybil Derrible, [initially set out to
    study](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/thousands-of-u-s-cities-could-become-virtual-ghost-towns-by-2100/):
    the [transportation challenges](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.trip.2023.100886) that
    cities in just one state, Illinois, could face as their populations change over

    to include all 50 states, basing their projections on population trends from US
    census data from three time periods over 20 years, and two datasets incorporating

    projects will rise as the century marches on. Depending on the climate scenario
    modeled, up to 64 percent of cities could be in decline by 2100, the researchers
    found.
