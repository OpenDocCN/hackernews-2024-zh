  zh: 当 K-12 学校于 2020 年春季关闭其面对面授课时，对学生和教师产生了各种负面影响。它还中断了未来教育工作者的培训机会。

- en: Starting June 2020, Massachusetts began temporarily letting anyone with a bachelor’s
    degree teach. According to [data compiled](https://wheelockpolicycenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Emergency-License-Y1-Report.pdf)

    one of these emergency licenses.

    5,800 人获得了这些紧急许可证。
- en: Like other first-year teachers, those granted emergency credentials were disproportionately
    assigned to work with children with disabilities, English learners and low-income
    students. And, in fact, they had more such children in their classrooms. Even
    so, their students saw [about the same rate of growth](https://wheelockpolicycenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Emergency-License-Y2-Report.pdf)
    in math and reading as children taught by regularly licensed educators. Because
    most did not teach tested grades and subjects, the researchers also looked at
    evaluation ratings. Both groups of teachers received similar marks from their
    supervisors.

  zh: 与其他首年教师一样，获得紧急凭证的人被不成比例地指派与残疾儿童、英语学习者和低收入学生一起工作。事实上，他们的教室中有更多这样的孩子。即便如此，他们的学生在数学和阅读方面[看到的增长率](https://wheelockpolicycenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Emergency-License-Y2-Report.pdf)与由正式许可教育工作者教授的儿童相同。由于大多数人不教授被测试的年级和科目，研究人员还查看了评价等级。两组教师都获得了类似的评价。

  zh: 持有这些许可证工作的教师也有助于使该州的教室多样化，因为他们约有其他新教育工作者的两倍可能是黑人、西班牙裔或亚裔。
- en: 'New Jersey’s waiver policy was similar. Candidates could earn a temporary credential
    before passing the normal licensure exams or completing a teacher preparation
    program. The licenses were good for one year, at which point candidates would
    need to go back, pass the tests and complete their training. Still, [researchers
    Ben Backes and Dan Goldhaber](https://caldercenter.org/sites/default/files/CALDER%20WP%20286-0623.pdf)
    found similar outcomes as in Massachusetts: Teachers without the normal training
    and testing were at least as effective in reading and math as other novices.'

  zh: 新泽西的许可政策类似。候选人可以在通过常规许可考试或完成教师培训计划之前获得临时资格。许可有效期为一年，此后候选人需要重新参加考试并完成培训。但是，[研究人员Ben
    Backes和Dan Goldhaber](https://caldercenter.org/sites/default/files/CALDER%20WP%20286-0623.pdf)发现与马萨诸塞州类似的结果：没有经过正常培训和考试的教师在阅读和数学方面至少与其他新手一样有效。
- en: One preliminary explanation from the New Jersey study was that the emergency
    licensed teachers were working in schools that had a record of helping students
    make strong academic gains. It’s possible that the schools had supports in place,
    such as teacher coaching, a strong curriculum or something else that compensated
    for less training.

  zh: 新泽西州研究中的一个初步解释是，获得临时许可的教师正在工作的学校有记录表明他们在帮助学生取得良好的学术成绩方面表现强劲。可能这些学校已经有了支持措施，比如教师辅导，强有力的课程或其他补偿较少培训的支持。

- en: The results are, in fact, part of a pendulum swing in teacher preparation. A
    decade ago, states were trying to raise the bar. The supply of [new educators](https://www.educationnext.org/why-are-fewer-people-becoming-teachers/)
    had risen steadily throughout the 1990s and 2000s, and there was a regular [surplus](https://caldercenter.org/sites/default/files/CALDER%20Policy%20Brief%203-1116-1.pdf)

  zh: 有一些证据表明，教师资格考试能在一定程度上准确地预测谁会成为一个好教育者。其他条件相同的情况下，学校更好选择考试成绩更高的候选人，尤其是如果他们将要教授数学或科学。但是这一通用规则会误解很多教师——有些人考试成绩不错，但在课堂管理或人际交往技能方面表现不佳，而其他人可能考试不好，但在与孩子们打交道方面很有成效。
