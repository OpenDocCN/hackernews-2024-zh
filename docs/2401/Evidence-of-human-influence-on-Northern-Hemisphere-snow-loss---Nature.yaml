    on spring snowpack. First, we follow an attribution that uses the correlation
    between observed historical snowpack trends from several SWE data products and
    those from climate model simulations. Second, we take a data–model fusion approach
    in which we generate a large observation-based ensemble of historical snowpack
    and estimate what March SWE would have been in the absence of anthropogenically
    forced changes to cold-season temperature and precipitation. The former indicates
    forced changes to hemispheric snowpack and the latter indicates forced snow changes
    at hydrologically relevant scales.

    alone, we calculate the spatial pattern of trends in March SWE from 1981 to 2020
    in each model’s HIST simulation and for every unique 40-year period from those
    same models’ unforced PIC simulations (for example, for a 500-year PIC simulation,
    we generate 461 maps of 40-year trends). All trends are calculated using the Theil–Sen
    estimator, a non-parametric technique for estimating a linear trend that is more
    robust to data that is skewed or contains outliers than trends calculated using
    ordinary least squares regression. Then, we calculate the Spearman (rank) correlation
    coefficient between the spatial maps of HIST and PIC trends to quantify the pattern
    similarity. The resulting empirical distribution of 78,601 correlations (background
    histogram on Fig. [2](/articles/s41586-023-06794-y#Fig2)) represents the likelihood
    that the pattern in the forced historical simulations could have arisen from natural
    variability alone.

    between the map of trends from each observational product and the multimodel mean
    map from the HIST simulations (red symbols in Fig. [2e](/articles/s41586-023-06794-y#Fig2)).
    For this analysis, the in situ observations are aggregated to the same 2° × 2°
    grid as the gridded observations and climate models by taking the mean trend of
    all stations within each grid cell (Fig. [2a](/articles/s41586-023-06794-y#Fig2)).
    If the correlations between the observations and HIST simulations are greater
    than almost all of the correlations between the HIST and PIC simulations, we can
    reject the null hypothesis that the observed historical pattern could have arisen
    from natural variability alone and claim that a response to historical forcing
    is present in the observed pattern. Furthermore, if we cannot reject the null
    hypothesis using the correlations between the observations and HIST-NAT simulations
    with only solar and volcanic forcing, then it is unlikely that the observed pattern
    is the result of natural radiative forcing. Combined, these two lines of evidence
    strongly indicate that anthropogenic forcing is causing the observed patterns
    of SWE trends.

    (that is, all grid-cell years from 1981 to 2020), then aggregate the predicted
    gridded values to the river-basin scale. We find that training a single model
    on the full panel of data offers two main advantages over training multiple models
    on more local data (for example, a model for each river basin). First is that
    the out-of-sample prediction skill of the full panel model is significantly higher
    in many highly populated mid-latitude basins of the western USA, western Europe
    and High Mountain Asia; local models are more skilful in fewer than 20% of basins,
    concentrated in sparsely populated high-latitude basins where the skill of the
    full panel model is already high (Extended Data Fig. [3](/articles/s41586-023-06794-y#Fig7)).
    Second, training a single model on data from the entire hemisphere provides greater
    statistical stability of projections made with large perturbations to the input
    variables, such as adding an end-of-century climate change signal (Extended Data
    Fig. [8](/articles/s41586-023-06794-y#Fig12)), which could exceed the support

    temperature and precipitation and create a sufficiently wide ensemble of possible
    SWE values, we repeat this procedure for all combinations of 6 SWE (5 gridded + in
    situ), 4 temperature and 5 precipitation datasets (Extended Data Table [1](/articles/s41586-023-06794-y#Tab1)),
    providing 120 (6 × 4 × 5) estimates of basin-scale March SWE from 1981 to 2020\.
    Our ensemble approach is motivated by two main considerations. First, it is difficult
    to determine what represents ‘true’ snowpack at hydrologically relevant scales.
    All methods of estimating spatially distributed snowpack (for example, remote
    sensing or reanalysis) have their intrinsic limitations that result in high levels
    of disagreement on snow mass, its variability and long-term trends^([5](/articles/s41586-023-06794-y#ref-CR5

    "Mortimer, C. et al. Evaluation of long-term Northern Hemisphere snow water equivalent
    products. Cryosphere 14, 1579–1594 (2020).")), as we show in Fig. [1](/articles/s41586-023-06794-y#Fig1).
    In situ measurements may represent truth at the locations at which they are collected,
    but are difficult to generalize, especially in complex terrain. As a result, using
    these point observations to adjudicate which gridded products (whose values represent
    averages over tens to tens of thousands of kilometres) lie closest to ‘truth’
    is challenging. Given the inability to know the true state of snowpack or rigorously
    rule out any of its various gridded estimates, we choose to consider these observational
    products as equally valid estimates of truth in which we can attempt to identify
    shared responses. Second, the ensemble approach allows us to capture the structural
    uncertainty in how SWE responds to changes in temperature and precipitation, which
    are themselves subject to data uncertainties (Supplementary Fig. [2](/articles/s41586-023-06794-y#MOESM1)).
    Using all dataset combinations, we can sample and characterize uncertainty in
    SWE, temperature and precipitation and their covariance with one another. Such

    between the 30-year rolling mean average temperature for each month in the HIST
    and HIST-NAT runs. For precipitation, we calculate the forced response as the
    percentage difference between 30-year rolling mean monthly precipitation in HIST
    versus HIST-NAT. By differencing experiments from the same model, we hope to limit
    the influence of model biases in climatological temperature and precipitation,
    as each model is benchmarked to its own climatology. Systematic biases in the
    model-simulated trends (for example, too rapid warming or wetting), however, could
    potentially lead to over- or under-estimating the forced response. To address
    this possibility, we evaluate model biases in the 1981–2020 trends in winter temperature
    and precipitation against observed trends by taking the difference between the
    CMIP6 HIST ensemble mean and the mean of the observational products for each quantity
    (Extended Data Fig. [6](/articles/s41586-023-06794-y#Fig10)). To test whether
    the observed and modelled trends are consistent, we ask whether the observed trend
    falls within a plausible range of forcing plus internal variability, given as
    the 2.5–97.5th percentile range of the CMIP6 HIST trends. Only 1% (3%) of grid
    cells fall outside this range for temperature (precipitation), indicating that
    the climate models capture realistic historical climate trends.

    precipitation, we create counterfactual time series of temperature and precipitation
    by downscaling the output to the 0.5° × 0.5° resolution of the observational ensemble
    using conservative regridding and removing the forced response from each model
    realization from each gridded temperature and precipitation dataset. Temperature
    is adjusted by subtracting the forced change from the observations and precipitation
    is adjusted by the forced percentage change. Then, we use the reconstruction models
    trained on historical data (equation ([1](/articles/s41586-023-06794-y#Equ1)))
    to predict March SWE using the counterfactual temperature and precipitation data,
    giving an estimate of what SWE would have been absent human-caused climate change.
    In addition, we isolate the effects of forced changes to temperature and precipitation
    individually by removing the forced response of only one or the other quantity
    from the observations, while leaving the other at its observed historical values.
    These gridded counterfactual reconstructions are then similarly aggregated to
    the basin scale and linear trends in SWE for these counterfactual scenarios are
    calculated using the Theil–Sen estimator. The effect of forced changes to temperature
    and precipitation individually (Fig. [3c,d](/articles/s41586-023-06794-y#Fig3))

    as the difference between each historical trend and the counterfactual trends
    based on the same SWE–temperature–precipitation dataset combination. For each
    of the 120 reconstruction ensemble members, we have 101 estimates of the anthropogenic
    effect (one from each climate model realization; Extended Data Table [2](/articles/s41586-023-06794-y#Tab2)),
    for a total of 12,120 estimates for each basin. Using only the first realization
    from each climate model, rather than all available runs, produces nearly identical

    using SWE, temperature and precipitation data from the CMIP6 HIST simulations
    over the 1981–2020 period, rather than observations. Then, we use the random forest
    trained on these HIST data to predict counterfactual SWE using temperature and
    precipitation from the HIST-NAT simulations. Finally, we compare the forced (HIST
    minus HIST-NAT) trends calculated from the reconstruction approach to the ‘true’
    forced trends calculated by using the direct SWE output from the HIST and HIST-NAT
    climate model experiments (Extended Data Fig. [9](/articles/s41586-023-06794-y#Fig13)
    and Supplementary Fig. [7](/articles/s41586-023-06794-y#MOESM1)). The strong similarity

    using observations with forced changes in temperature and precipitation removed
    produces reasonable estimates of a forced SWE change.
