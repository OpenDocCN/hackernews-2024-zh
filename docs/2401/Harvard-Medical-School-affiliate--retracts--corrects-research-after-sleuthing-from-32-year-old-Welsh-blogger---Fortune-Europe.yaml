    Sholto David presented suspicious images from more than 30 published papers by

    the blog post. By Jan. 22, the institution said it was in the process of requesting
    six retractions of published research and that another 31 papers warranted corrections.

    the research is so severely flawed that the findings are no longer reliable.

    said Ivan Oransky, who teaches medical journalism at New York University and co-founded

    scientific papers and use software tools to help find problems.

    under pseudonyms. Together, they have “changed the equation” in scientific publication,

    flipped. Scientists building their careers or seeking tenure face pressure to
    get published. Some may intentionally falsify data, knowing that the process of

    to catch fakery.
