    before it can completely replace internal combustion, especially in trucks. Still,
    [electrification is promising](https://www.thedrive.com/news/the-ford-f-150-lightning-shows-how-great-ev-towing-will-be),
    and it can actually be a boon to productivity and performance when [done right](https://www.thedrive.com/news/2025-ram-1500-ramcharger-smashes-ev-range-with-690-miles-v6-range-extender).
    Edison Motors out of Canada aims to prove that, first with its [diesel-electric
    Class 8 vehicles](https://www.thedrive.com/news/watch-the-diesel-electric-edison-semi-truck-tow-a-wwii-tank-without-breaking-a-sweat)
    and then with its [newly announced project](https://www.edisonmotors.ca/edison-pickup-kit):
    series hybrid pickup conversions pairing a Caterpillar diesel generator with electric
    motors.'

    we said about Edison's electrified logging truck concept not long ago, of course,
    and now there's a driving prototype of the thing. It's for that reason I'm cautiously
    optimistic that these gung-ho engineers will follow through with their plans of
    future-proofing light-duty trucks just the same.

    The former is a 350-horsepower setup, presumably with a single electric motor
    powering the rear wheels, and the latter is a 500-hp offering with a drive unit
    for each axle. A 60-90 kilowatt-hour lithium-iron-phosphate battery will provide
    the juice and when it runs low, it'll be charged back up with a Caterpillar diesel
    engine. Exactly which CAT Edison plans to use is unclear, but we see a very similar
    layout in the company's "Topsy" semi-truck with a 9.3-liter inline-six.

- en: Edison says it will offer single-rear-wheel and dually options, supporting the
    idea that these kits will be made to work. That's backed up by the 7,716-pound
    load rating for each axle, which is slightly above [a 2024 Ford F-350 SRW](https://www.thedrive.com/car-reviews/2023-ford-super-duty-review-specs-price-options-impressions).
    The electrified powertrain will almost certainly be heavier than a traditional
    diesel engine alone, but this could potentially turn classic trucks into even
    mightier workhorses.

    dealers. You don't have to rely on [your 12-valve Cummins knowledge](https://www.thedrive.com/news/not-every-ram-truck-with-a-12-valve-cummins-can-drift-like-this-one)
    to swap your truck over to a high-voltage electrical system, in other words. That's
    also a plus for service, as Edison is seeking out certified dealer partners across
    the United States and Canada.

- en: The small start-up plans to show a completed prototype by September 2024 with
    regular production starting mid-2025\. Edison claims to have all the parts chosen
    and supplier agreements in place. The kit will "ideally" retail for one-third
    to half the price of a new diesel truck while providing estimated savings of 30%
    on fuel. That may not sound like much to everybody, but if you're using a truck
    for your business, that could really add up over time.

  zh: 这家小型初创公司计划在2024年9月展示一个完整的原型，定期生产将于2025年中期开始。爱迪生声称所有零件已经选择好，并且供应商协议已经就位。该套件的“理想”零售价格将是新柴油卡车价格的三分之一到一半，同时提供燃料节约估计为30％。这对每个人来说可能听起来并不多，但如果您将卡车用于您的业务，随着时间的推移，这可能真的会积累起来。
- en: That's the hope for this project, it seems—extending the usable life of existing
    trucks. That alone is a respectable aspiration considering [the resources required
    to build new electric pickups](https://www.thedrive.com/news/electric-pickup-trucks-are-dirtier-than-you-think)
    with their huge battery packs. Sure, it won't be for everybody, but I have a hunch
    that a market will form for these kits if Edison follows through. You can reserve
    your own today for $250.
