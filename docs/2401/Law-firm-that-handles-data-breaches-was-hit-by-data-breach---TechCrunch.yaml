    stole the personal information and sensitive health data of [more than 637,000
    data breach victims](https://apps.web.maine.gov/online/aeviewer/ME/40/8a2cebbb-af51-4e3b-ab37-a64ff132a972.shtml?=010420240000)

    Orrick said the hackers stole reams of data from its systems that pertain to security
    incidents at other companies, during which Orrick served as legal counsel.

    individuals who had vision plans with insurance giant EyeMed Vision Care and those
    who had dental plans with Delta Dental of California, a healthcare insurance network
    giant that provides dental coverage to about 45 million individuals. Orrick also
    said it notified health insurance company MultiPlan, behavioral health giant Beacon
    Health Options (now known as Carelon) and the U.S. Small Business Administration
    that their data was also compromised in Orrick’s data breach.

    address and email addresses, and government-issued identification numbers, such
    as Social Security numbers, passport and driver license numbers, and tax identification
    numbers. The data also includes medical treatment and diagnosis information, insurance
    claims information — such as the date and costs of services — and healthcare insurance
