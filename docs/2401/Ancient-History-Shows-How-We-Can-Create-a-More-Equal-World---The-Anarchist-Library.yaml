- en: Most of human history is irreparably lost to us. Our species, *Homo sapiens*,
    has existed for at least 200,000 years, but we have next to no idea what was happening
    for the majority of that time. In northern Spain, for instance, at the cave of
    Altamira, paintings and engravings were created over a period of at least 10,000
    years, between around 25,000 and 15,000 B.C. Presumably, a lot of dramatic events
    occurred during that period. We have no way of knowing what most of them were.
    This is of little consequence to most people, since most people rarely think about
    the broad sweep of human history anyway. They don’t have much reason to. Insofar
    as the question comes up at all, it’s usually when reflecting on why the world
    seems to be in such a mess and why human beings so often treat each other badly
    — the reasons for war, greed, exploitation and indifference to others’ suffering.
    Were we always like that, or did something, at some point, go terribly wrong?

    philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau, in an essay on the origins of social inequality
    that he submitted to a competition in 1754\. Once upon a time, he wrote, we were
    hunter-gatherers, living in a state of childlike innocence, as equals. These bands
    of foragers could be egalitarian because they were isolated from one another,
    and their material needs were simple. According to Rousseau, it was only after
    the agricultural revolution and the rise of cities that this happy condition came
    to an end. Urban living meant the appearance of written literature, science and
    philosophy, but at the same time, almost everything bad in human life: patriarchy,
    standing armies, mass executions and annoying bureaucrats demanding that we spend
    much of our lives filling out forms.'

    a dominant narrative of human history, laying the foundations upon which contemporary
    “big history” writers — such as Jared Diamond, Francis Fukuyama and Yuval Noah
    Harari — built their accounts of how our societies evolved. These writers often
    talk about inequality as the natural result of living in larger groups with a
    surplus of resources. For example, Mr. Harari writes in “Sapiens: A Brief History
    of Humankind” that, after the advent of agriculture, rulers and elites sprang
    up “everywhere … living off the peasants’ surplus food and leaving them with only
    a bare subsistence.”'

    Mesoamerica and elsewhere — did appear to confirm this. If you put enough people
    in one place, the evidence seemed to show, they would start dividing themselves
    into social classes. You could see inequality emerge in the archaeological record
    with the appearance of temples and palaces, presided over by rulers and their
    elite kinsmen, and storehouses and workshops, run by administrators and overseers.
    Civilization seemed to come as a package: It meant misery and suffering for those
    who would inevitably be reduced to serfs, slaves or debtors, but it also allowed
    for the possibility of art, technology, and science.'

    Yes, living in a truly egalitarian society might be possible if you’re a Pygmy
    or a Kalahari Bushman. But if you want to live in a city like New York, London
    or Shanghai — if you want all the good things that come with concentrations of
    people and resources — then you have to accept the bad things, too. For generations,
    such assumptions have formed part of our origin story. The history we learn in
    school has made us more willing to tolerate a world in which some can turn their
    wealth into power over others, while others are told their needs are not important
    and their lives have no intrinsic worth. As a result, we are more likely to believe
    that inequality is just an inescapable consequence of living in large, complex,
    urban, technologically sophisticated societies.'

    that much of what has been discovered in the last few decades, by archaeologists
    and others in kindred disciplines, cuts against the conventional wisdom propounded
    by modern “big history” writers. ​​What this new evidence shows is that a surprising
    number of the world’s earliest cities were organized along robustly egalitarian
    lines. In some regions, we now know, urban populations governed themselves for
    centuries without any indication of the temples and palaces that would later emerge;
    in others, temples and palaces never emerged at all, and there is simply no evidence
    of a class of administrators or any other sort of ruling stratum. It would seem
    that the mere fact of urban life does not, necessarily, imply any particular form
    of political organization, and never did. Far from resigning us to inequality,
    the new picture that is now emerging of humanity’s deep past may open our eyes
    to egalitarian possibilities we otherwise would have never considered.

    inhabited by tens of thousands of people made their first appearance around 6,000
    years ago. The conventional story goes that cities developed largely because of
    advances in technology: They were a result of the agricultural revolution, which
    set off a chain of developments that made it possible to support large numbers
    of people living in one place. But in fact, one of the most populous early cities
    appeared not in Eurasia — with its many technical and logistical advantages —
    but in Mesoamerica, which had no wheeled vehicles or sailing ships, no animal-powered
    transport and much less in the way of metallurgy or literate bureaucracy. In short,
    it’s easy to overstate the importance of new technologies in setting the overall
    direction of change.'

    of civic unity, the arrangement of built spaces in harmonious and often beautiful
    patterns, clearly reflecting some kind of planning at the municipal scale. Where
    we do have written sources (ancient Mesopotamia, for example), we find large groups
    of citizens referring to themselves simply as “the people” of a given city (or
    often its “sons”), united by devotion to its founding ancestors, its gods or heroes,
    its civic infrastructure and ritual calendar. In China’s Shandong Province, urban
    settlements were present over a thousand years before the earliest known royal
    dynasties, and similar findings have emerged from the Maya lowlands, where ceremonial
    centers of truly enormous size — so far, presenting no evidence of monarchy or
    stratification — can now be dated back as far as 1000 B.C., long before the rise
    of Classic Maya kings and dynasties.

    and bureaucrats? For answers, we might turn to some other surprising discoveries
    on the interior grasslands of eastern Europe, north of the Black Sea, where archaeologists
    have found cities, just as large and ancient as those of Mesopotamia. The earliest
    date back to around 4100 B.C. While Mesopotamian cities, in what are now the lands
    of Syria and Iraq, took form initially around temples, and later also royal palaces,
    the prehistoric cities of Ukraine and Moldova were startling experiments in decentralized
    urbanization. These sites were planned on the image of a great circle — or series
    of circles — of houses, with nobody first, nobody last, divided into districts
    with assembly buildings for public meetings.

    of these early Ukrainian cities. Living at the frontier of forest and steppe,
    the residents were not just cereal farmers and livestock-keepers, but also hunted
    deer and wild boar, imported salt, flint and copper, and kept gardens within the
    bounds of the city, consuming apples, pears, cherries, acorns, hazelnuts and apricots
    — all served on painted ceramics, which are considered among the finest aesthetic
    creations of the prehistoric world.

    this required, but most would agree the logistical challenges were daunting. Residents
    definitely produced a surplus, and with it came ample opportunity for some of
    them to seize control of the stocks and supplies, to lord it over the others or
    fight for the spoils, but over eight centuries we find little evidence of warfare
    or the rise of social elites. The true complexity of these early cities lay in
    the political strategies they adopted to prevent such things. Careful analysis
    by archaeologists shows how the social freedoms of the Ukrainian city dwellers
    were maintained through processes of local decision-making, in households and
    neighborhood assemblies, without any need for centralized control or top-down
    administration.

    they do, academics tend to call them “mega-sites” rather than cities, a kind of
    euphemism that signals to a wider audience that they should not be thought of
    as proper cities but as villages that for some reason had expanded inordinately
    in size. Some even refer to them outright as “overgrown villages.” How do we account
    for this reluctance to welcome the Ukrainian mega-sites into the charmed circle
    of urban origins? Why has anyone with even a passing interest in the origin of
    cities heard of Uruk or Mohenjo-daro, but almost no one of Taljanky or Nebelivka?

    Away From Omelas,” about an imaginary city that also made do without kings, wars,
    slaves or secret police. We have a tendency, Le Guin notes, to write off such
    a community as “simple,” but in fact these citizens of Omelas were “not simple
    folk, not dulcet shepherds, noble savages, bland utopians. They were not less
    complex than us.” The trouble is just that we have a bad habit of “considering
    happiness as something rather stupid.”

    of Ukrainian mega-sites like Maidanetske or Nebelivka were, compared with the
    steppe-lords who covered nearby landscapes with treasure-filled mounds, or even
    the servants ritually sacrificed at their funerals (though we can guess). And
    as anyone who has read the story knows, Omelas had some problems, too.

    way for a large population to govern and support itself without temples, palaces
    and military fortifications — that is, without overt displays of arrogance and
    cruelty — are somehow less complex than those who have not? Why would we hesitate
    to dignify such a place with the name of “city”? The mega-sites of Ukraine and
    adjoining regions were inhabited from roughly 4100 to 3300 B.C., which is a considerably
    longer period of time than most subsequent urban settlements. Eventually, they
    were abandoned. We still don’t know why. What they offer us, in the meantime,
    is significant: further proof that a highly egalitarian society has been possible
    on an urban scale.'

    Since the Great Recession of 2008, the question of inequality — and with it, the
    long-term history of inequality — have become major topics for debate. Something
    of a consensus has emerged among intellectuals and even, to some degree, the political
    classes, that levels of social inequality have gotten out of hand, and that most
    of the world’s problems result, in one way or another, from an ever-widening gulf
    between the haves and the have-nots. A very small percentage of the population
    control the fates of almost everyone else, and they are doing it in an increasingly
    disastrous fashion. Cities have become emblematic of our predicament. Whether
    in Cape Town or San Francisco, we are no longer shocked or even that surprised
    by the sight of ever-expanding slums — sidewalks crammed with makeshift tents
    or shelters overflowing with the homeless and destitute.

    precedent for that, too. Around the start of the common era, thousands of people
    came together in the Valley of Mexico to found a city we know today as Teotihuacan.
    Within a few centuries it became the largest settlement in Mesoamerica. In a colossal
    feat of civil engineering, its inhabitants diverted the San Juan River to flow
    through the heart of their new metropolis. Pyramids went up in the central district,
    associated with ritual killing. What we might expect to see next is the rise of
    luxurious palaces for warrior-rulers, but the citizens of Teotihuacan chose a
    different path. Around A.D. 300, the people of Teotihuacan changed course, redirecting
    their efforts away from the construction of grand monuments and devoting resources
    instead to the provision of high-quality housing for the majority of residents,
    who numbered around 100,000.

    the proto-superblock, and a cornucopia of other urban forms, waiting for us to

    only viable future for the world’s cities, and so for our planet. All we are lacking
