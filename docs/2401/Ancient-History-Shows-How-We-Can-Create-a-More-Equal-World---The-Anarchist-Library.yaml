- en: Most of human history is irreparably lost to us. Our species, *Homo sapiens*,
    has existed for at least 200,000 years, but we have next to no idea what was happening
    for the majority of that time. In northern Spain, for instance, at the cave of
    Altamira, paintings and engravings were created over a period of at least 10,000
    years, between around 25,000 and 15,000 B.C. Presumably, a lot of dramatic events
    occurred during that period. We have no way of knowing what most of them were.
    This is of little consequence to most people, since most people rarely think about
    the broad sweep of human history anyway. They don’t have much reason to. Insofar
    as the question comes up at all, it’s usually when reflecting on why the world
    seems to be in such a mess and why human beings so often treat each other badly
    — the reasons for war, greed, exploitation and indifference to others’ suffering.
    Were we always like that, or did something, at some point, go terribly wrong?

    philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau, in an essay on the origins of social inequality
    that he submitted to a competition in 1754\. Once upon a time, he wrote, we were
    hunter-gatherers, living in a state of childlike innocence, as equals. These bands
    of foragers could be egalitarian because they were isolated from one another,
    and their material needs were simple. According to Rousseau, it was only after
    the agricultural revolution and the rise of cities that this happy condition came
    to an end. Urban living meant the appearance of written literature, science and
    philosophy, but at the same time, almost everything bad in human life: patriarchy,
    standing armies, mass executions and annoying bureaucrats demanding that we spend
    much of our lives filling out forms.'

    talk about inequality as the natural result of living in larger groups with a
    surplus of resources. For example, Mr. Harari writes in “Sapiens: A Brief History
    of Humankind” that, after the advent of agriculture, rulers and elites sprang
    up “everywhere … living off the peasants’ surplus food and leaving them with only

    lines. In some regions, we now know, urban populations governed themselves for
    centuries without any indication of the temples and palaces that would later emerge;
    in others, temples and palaces never emerged at all, and there is simply no evidence
    of a class of administrators or any other sort of ruling stratum. It would seem
    that the mere fact of urban life does not, necessarily, imply any particular form
    of political organization, and never did. Far from resigning us to inequality,

    its civic infrastructure and ritual calendar. In China’s Shandong Province, urban
