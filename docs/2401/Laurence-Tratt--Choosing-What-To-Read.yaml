- en: Like many people, I spend a lot of time reading. Since there is much more that
    I could read than there is time for, I have to make choices about what I should
    read. In this short post I’m going to outline what my reading choices have become
    and why. My aim isn’t to suggest that anyone else should make the same choices
    – indeed, they’re intensely personal – but, rather, that thinking about such choices
    is worthwhile.

    that I’m a literary philistine out loud is close to a taboo and for many years
    I downplayed it. These days, I’m much less worried about this admission, in part
    because the alternative I have gravitated towards has given me greater personal
    satisfaction and, I hope, insights: history.'

- en: 'Personally, I find that history contains many more surprises than authors can
    get away with in fiction. We have a strong sense of what is plausible: this constrains
    writers, even in supposedly fantastical settings, and readers tend to dislike
    violations of it . Our sense of what is plausible is in large part defined by
    our life experience — but most of our lives take part within surprisingly narrow
    parameters.'

- en: For example, since our day-to-day lives are fairly ordered and predictable,
    we assume that important people can carry out ordered and predictable plans —
    but the real world is complex, messy, and contingent in a way that makes this
    impossible. Most of us don’t know (and I hope will never know!) what war is like
    and that makes us surprisingly resistant to descriptions of the real thing. We
    assume that morality is absolute and evolves in a straight line , so we fail to
    realise that people in the past held fundamentally different assumptions about
    morality . And so on.

- en: History, I’ve slowly discovered, is full of stories that seem utterly implausible,
    until you realise that they’re true. The [charge of the light brigade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charge_of_the_Light_Brigade)
    was based on a misunderstood command, something which turns out to be rather common
    in military history. Our idea of a [fairytale castle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuschwanstein_Castle)
    is based on the whim of an eccentric, profligate Bavarian King who later died
    in mysterious circumstances. The 2000 year old [Pantheon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pantheon,_Rome)
    is still the largest unsupported concrete dome in the world, and we haven’t quite
    worked out how to produce concrete of such quality . The [man who led the armed
    uprising that caused the Costa Rican civil war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jos%C3%A9_Figueres_Ferrer)
    won, abolished the army, voluntarily stepped down as dictator after 18 months,
    served two much later terms as president, and at 65 years old stood on the tarmac
    with a machine gun until a plane’s hijackers surrendered.

    all the time that I once spent reading fiction to history. This was not as easy
    as it sounds. Every time I read about a new historical era, or location, I spend
    considerable time baffled by the new setting. In other words the “setup” costs
    are considerable. But, for me, the results [have been more than worth it](/laurie/blog/2020/alternative_sources_of_advice.html).

- en: Much of my reading, though, is not historical. Like many people I take an active
    interest in the world around me. For many years I read a great deal of news, nearly
    all via newspapers . However, probably due to the effects of the internet, I slowly
    noticed that the quality of journalism in newspapers was in decline.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'I also noticed how *depressing* the “news” generally is: as the cliche goes,
    bad news sells, so that’s what tends to get written about. I realised that not
    only was I spending hours a week reading about horrible events (murders, corruption,
    war, etc.) but that I was being heavily influenced by this — I thought the world
    was a worse place than it really is .'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now I skim the news on a daily basis, but I filter out everything that seems
    “transitory”, particularly if it’s depressing. Instead, I’m looking to identify
    and understand longer term trends, not (unless they’re major) one-off events.
    The most consistent publication I’ve found that matches what I want is the Economist.
    I understand, and can largely correct for, its biases. Since its writing about
    areas I know well is consistently good, I am reasonably confident that generalises
    to those areas I don’t know well and wish to learn more about.

- en: I read a small number of opinion pieces in newspapers and a moderate number
    of blogs in the same sort of vein. At one point I was carefree in such reading,
    but I realised that I was in danger of only reading those pieces that confirmed,
    positively or negatively, my existing world-view . At best this was a waste of
    my time, and at worse it was making it less likely that I would revise incorrect
    opinions. These days I select the people I read carefully, but not for their ideology
    — rather, I’m looking for thoughtful people who can challenge my thinking in a
    carefully justified way. Not many weeks go by without this causing me, even if
    only slightly, to adjust an opinion.

- en: Perhaps the major portion of my reading relates to my job. Although I’m formally
    an academic I read, mostly daily, a large number of non-academic programming articles
    and blogs. Most obviously, these keep me up-to date on real-world trends. Less
    obviously, I find them an invaluable source of inspiration for identifying problems.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It’s easy as an academic to propose things one already knows as solutions, but
    it’s much harder to know if they solve problems anyone might care about. Since
    I continually look for problems, I occasionally find a (sometimes partial) match
    with something I know about. My hit rate for this is low. I notice a match a handful
    of times a year at most, and in the past I’ve often gone for much longer than
    that without a single match. Despite that, I still consider this time exceptionally
    well spent.

- en: I also read academic papers, mostly in the field of programming languages. I
    no longer consistently follow any conferences or journals. Partly this is because
    they’re too intermittent and I prefer to space my reading out over time. But,
    mostly, it’s because peer review is inherently conservative and tends to reject
    work in unfamiliar areas. When reading research speculatively, I am more interested
    in increasing the breadth of my knowledge than I am the depth .

- en: Over time, I’ve settled upon checking daily two or three arXiv lists (e.g. [cs.PL](https://arxiv.org/list/cs.PL/recent)).
    Based almost entirely on the title, I’ll skim perhaps 3-5 papers a week this way,
    and read in some detail perhaps 2-3 a month. I don’t do as good a job at this
    as I probably should, and I find it the easiest sort of reading to skip when I
    feel busy, but I have still found this very helpful over time.

- en: Finally, I do a certain amount of reviewing as part my job. I used to do a *lot*
    more of this. Slowly, I realised that not only was I doing more of this than was
    useful to me, but in so doing I was denying other people the opportunity to do
    so . I still perform slightly more reviews than I receive reviews, but I keep
    a fairly strict cap on it.

    much a reflection of my biases, interests, and needs, and I don’t recommend that
    anyone follows this algorithm directly. For example, while fiction doesn’t do
    much for me, it might do a great deal for you — neither you or I is “right” or
    “wrong”. However, what I hope you’ve got from this post is a sense that *knowing*
    what you like to read is useful, and knowing *why* you like to read it doubly
    so. I’ve found it very useful to reflect on this, and perhaps you might too.'
