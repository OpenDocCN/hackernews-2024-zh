  zh: Riot员工们，
- en: Today, I’m sharing a decision we hoped we would never have to make at Riot.
    We’re changing some of the bets we’ve made and shifting how we work across the
    company to create focus and move us toward a more sustainable future. This decision
    means we’re eliminating about 530 roles globally, which represents around 11%
    of our workforce, with the biggest impact to teams outside of core development.
    This also sadly means we’ll be saying goodbye to many talented colleagues and
    friends across all areas of Riot.

  zh: 今天，我要分享一项我们希望永远不必做出的决定。我们正在改变我们所做的一些赌注，调整公司内部的工作方式，以便更加聚焦，朝着更加可持续的未来发展。这意味着我们全球范围内将裁员约530人，占我们全球员工总数的约11%，主要影响非核心开发团队。这也意味着我们将不得不和许多才华横溢的同事和朋友告别。

- en: Since 2019, we’ve made a number of big bets across the company with the goal
    of making it better to be a player. We jumped headfirst into creating new experiences
    and broadening our portfolio, and grew quickly as we became a multi-game, multi-experience
    company — expanding our global footprint, changing our operating model, bringing
    in new talent to match our ambitions, and ultimately doubling the size of Riot
    in just a few years.

  zh: 自2019年以来，我们在全公司进行了一系列大赌注，目标是让玩家玩得更好。我们迅速投入到创造新体验和扩大我们的产品组合中，并随着成为一家多游戏、多体验公司而迅速成长——扩大我们的全球业务范围，改变我们的运营模式，引入新的人才来匹配我们的雄心，并在短短几年内将Riot的规模扩大一倍。
- en: Today, we’re a company without a sharp enough focus, and simply put, we have
    too many things underway. Some of the significant investments we’ve made aren’t
    paying off the way we expected them to. Our costs have grown to the point where
    they’re unsustainable, and we’ve left ourselves with no room for experimentation
    or failure – which is vital to a creative company like ours. All of this puts
    the core of our business at risk.

  zh: 如今，我们是一家没有足够明确的聚焦点的公司，简而言之，我们正在进行的项目太多了。我们所做的一些重大投资并没有带来我们预期的回报。我们的成本已经增长到无法持续的程度，我们已经没有了实验或失败的余地——而这对于像我们这样的创意公司至关重要。所有这些都将使我们业务的核心处于风险之中。
- en: Over the past several months, we’ve tried to alter our trajectory in many different
    ways. We asked leaders to make tradeoffs in the things their teams are working
    on. We rolled out hiring slowdowns, and in some cases hiring freezes. We put an
    emphasis on controlling costs while strengthening our revenue growth. All of which
    has without a doubt been tough for our teams.

  zh: 在过去的几个月里，我们尝试了许多不同的方式来改变我们的发展轨迹。我们要求领导者在他们的团队工作中做出取舍。我们推出了招聘减缓措施，甚至有些地方冻结了招聘。我们强调控制成本，同时加强收入增长。所有这些无疑对我们的团队来说都是艰难的。
- en: But as I’ve dug in with leaders across Riot, it’s become clear to all of us
    that these changes aren’t enough. We have to do more to focus our business and
    center our efforts on the things that drive the most player value – the things
    that are truly worth players’ time. Unfortunately, this involves making changes
    in the area where we invest the most — our headcount.

  zh: 但是，当我与Riot各个领导深入交流后，我们都清楚地意识到这些变化还不够。我们必须做得更多，以便将我们的业务聚焦在为玩家带来最大价值的事物上——这些事物真正值得玩家花费时间。不幸的是，这涉及到我们投入最多的领域——我们的人员编制。
- en: 'I want to be super clear about something: this is absolutely the last thing
    we ever wanted to do. A decision like this has a massive impact on people’s lives
    and on the culture of Riot. We’re not doing this to appease shareholders or to
    hit some quarterly earnings number – we’ve made this decision because it’s a necessity.
    It''s what we need to do in order to maintain a long-term focus for players.'

  zh: 我想非常清楚地表达一件事：这绝对是我们最不想做的事情。像这样的决定对人们的生活和 Riot 的文化有着巨大的影响。我们这样做不是为了讨好股东或者实现某个季度的盈利数字——我们做出这个决定是因为这是必要的。这是我们为了保持对玩家的长期关注所必须做的事情。

    very best to make sure we’re treating Rioters with respect and grace. We want
    those who are leaving us to feel supported in this difficult moment. This starts
    with limiting the time they spend in ambiguity about their role and future with
    Riot, wherever possible.

    Riot 的不确定性中所花费的时间。
- en: Within the next hour, Rioters around the world will receive an email informing
    them whether or not their role is, or may be, impacted. This isn’t the usual way
    we do things, but we wanted to optimize for letting people know as soon as possible,

    invite to meet with their Senior Leader and People team partner and discuss next
    steps within 48 hours. There's a wide range of local employment processes that
    have to be followed in situations like these. So, while these meetings will be

    RSUs will get to keep them, subject to their terms and conditions. This also applies
    to other vested instruments (like options, or cash-settled SARs in certain jurisdictions
    such as China). In the event of a future buyback opportunity, we intend to allow
    these former Rioters to participate. Rioters who hold dual-vesting equity, who
    have satisfied the service-based vesting component at the time of exit, will be

    12 个月内发生符合条件的流动性事件（如控制权变更交易），他们将能够获得股权授予。'
