- en: In normal metals, electricity flows in the form of charged particles. Now scientists
    may have found the first direct evidence that in so-called strange metals, electricity
    may flow as a mysterious fluid instead. In a [paper](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abq6100)
    published in *Science*, researchers suggest this electronic fluid could possess
    extraordinarily low viscosity, potentially leading to unusual applications.

- en: In conventional metals, electric current flows in the form of [quasiparticles](https://spectrum.ieee.org/quasiparticle-creates-heat-switch)—ripples
    that move inside lattices of atoms much like particles zipping through space.
    In addition, in regular metals, the resistance that electric current experiences
    typically rises in a quadratic way at low temperatures—slowly to start with as
    the metal gets warmer, and then faster and faster.

    electrical resistance instead rises in a linear manner as temperatures rise. Many
    different materials display this strange metallic behavior, such as [cuprates](https://spectrum.ieee.org/superconductor-maker-in-political-crosshairs),
    organic molecular crystals, [heavy fermion metals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heavy_fermion_material),
    and [twisted bilayer graphene](https://spectrum.ieee.org/hybrid-dimension-graphene),
    among others.

- en: Previous research suggested that current may behave in this odd way in strange
    metals because electrons within them may essentially possess no meaningful identity.
    Instead, electrons may exist in a dense state of [quantum entanglement](https://spectrum.ieee.org/what-is-quantum-entanglement)
    with one another, forming a kind of fluid.

    senior author [Douglas Natelson](https://profiles.rice.edu/faculty/douglas-natelson),
    a condensed-matter physicist at Rice University, in Houston. “Rather, the electrons
    are talking to each other so strongly and so often that you just can’t describe
    charge flowing in terms of approximately independent electrons.”

- en: One way to see if electricity flows in fluid or quasiparticle form in strange
    metals is to focus on the phenomenon of [shot noise](https://123.physics.ucdavis.edu/shot.html)—random
    fluctuations in an electric current that result from the way in which electricity
    normally consists of distinct chunks of charge. If electricity is a fluid in strange
    metals, shot noise should prove unusually quiet.

- en: Until now, direct experimental data was lacking. The kinds of shot noise experiments
    needed to prove this model required incredibly thin, perfectly crystalline wires
    to eliminate potential interference from extraneous material. Fabricating these
    wires from strange metals without affecting their electronic properties has proven
    very challenging.

- en: In the new study, researchers experimented with YbRh[2]Si[2] wires, a heavy
    fermion strange metal consisting of the elements ytterbium, rhodium, and silicon.
    With the help of study coauthor [Silke Paschen](https://www.ifp.tuwien.ac.at/paschen)’s
    group at the Vienna University of Technology, the scientists grew and tested extraordinarily
    thin crystalline wires of YbRh[2]Si[2]. “This is just another example of how high-quality
    materials growth opens up new realms of research and potential devices,” Natelson
    says.

    that are thought to have different underlying microscopic physics, and see if
