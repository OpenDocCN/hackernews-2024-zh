- en: We have seen incredible user growth and support from our open-source community
    in the past two years - recently exceeding 5M downloads. This is a testament to
    our mission to build the most efficient, scalable, high-performance vector database
    on the market. We are excited to further accelerate this trajectory with our new
    partner and investor, Spark Capital, and the continued support of Unusual Ventures
    and 42CAP. This partnership uniquely positions us to empower enterprises with
    cutting edge vector search technology to build truly differentiating, next-gen
    AI applications at scale.

- en: A paradigm shift is underway in the field of data management and information
    retrieval. Today, our world is increasingly dominated by complex, unstructured
    data like images, audio, video, and text. Traditional ways of retrieving data
    based on keyword matching are no longer sufficient. Vector databases are designed
    to handle complex high-dimensional data, unlocking the foundation for pivotal
    AI applications. They represent a new frontier in data management, in which complexity
    is not a barrier but an opportunity for innovation.

- en: The rise of generative AI in the last few years has shone a spotlight on vector
    databases, prized for their ability to power retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)
    applications. What we are seeing now, both within AI and beyond, is only the beginning
    of the opportunity for vector databases. Within our Qdrant community, we already
    see a multitude of unique solutions and applications leveraging our technology
    for multimodal search, anomaly detection, recommendation systems, complex data
    analysis, and more.

- en: 'To meet the needs of the next generation of AI applications, Qdrant has always
    been built with four keys in mind: efficiency, scalability, performance, and flexibility.
    Our goal is to give our users unmatched speed and reliability, even when they
    are building massive-scale AI applications requiring the handling of billions
    of vectors. We did so by building Qdrant on Rust for performance, memory safety,
    and scale. Additionally, [our custom HNSW search algorithm](https://qdrant.tech/articles/filtrable-hnsw/)
    and unique [filtering](https://qdrant.tech/documentation/concepts/filtering/)
    capabilities consistently lead to [highest RPS](https://qdrant.tech/benchmarks/),
    minimal latency, and high control with accuracy when running large-scale, high-dimensional
    operations.'

- en: Beyond performance, we provide our users with the most flexibility in cost savings
    and deployment options. A combination of cutting-edge efficiency features, like
    [built-in compression options](https://qdrant.tech/documentation/guides/quantization/),
    [multitenancy](https://qdrant.tech/documentation/guides/multiple-partitions/)
    and the ability to [offload data to disk](https://qdrant.tech/documentation/concepts/storage/),
    dramatically reduce memory consumption. Committed to privacy and security, crucial
    for modern AI applications, Qdrant now also offers on-premise and hybrid SaaS
    solutions, meeting diverse enterprise needs in a data-sensitive world. This approach,
    coupled with our open-source foundation, builds trust and reliability with engineers
    and developers, making Qdrant a game-changer in the vector database domain.
