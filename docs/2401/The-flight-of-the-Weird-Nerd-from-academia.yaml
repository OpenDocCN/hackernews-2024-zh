- en: 'The above quote from *Der Steppenwolf* is a good encapsulation of the difficulty
    faced by The Intellectual, or shall we say, in more modern terms, The Weird Nerd.
    Weird Nerds are distinguished by their unyielding devotion to Truth, often placing
    it above social graces or conventional norms. That’s one of the reasons the Nerd
    is “drowning”, as Hesse put it. This species, while occasionally difficult to
    interact with, plays a crucial role in society, acting as an innovator and “village
    truth-teller”. In the last decades, Weird Nerds have found a sanctuary within
    the confines of academia, a natural habitat where their traits are not only tolerated,
    but often nurtured. In this symbiotic relationship, the wider world benefits from
    the intellectual pursuits and discoveries of the Weird Nerd, without the need
    to engage directly with its often annoying demeanour. It''s a situation that seems
    to maintain a harmonious balance: the Weird Nerd is protected from “drowning”,
    while society at large reaps the rewards of its unique contributions without having
    to deal directly with it.'

    of a different type of species in academia: what I call The Failed Corporatist.
    This is someone who stumbles upon academia not so much out of a love for The Truth,
    as due to an inability to thrive in corporate settings for various other, unrelated
    reasons. But the Failed Corporatist has a very conventional, corporate like mindset
    anyway. It usually loves process, admin and adding more admin and adding more
    process and METRICS and social conformity. This skill set enables them to ascend
    the ranks of academic administration, often gaining significant influence and
    control over The Weird Nerd. Confronted with this altered habitat, The Nerd often
    finds itself in a state of distress and confusion. Its intrinsic motivation clashes
    with the newly imposed corporate-like order and the demand for conformity, leading
    to frantic efforts to assert its natural tendencies. Unfortunately, these efforts
    are often met with resistance or outright rejection, not only from The Failed
    Corporatist but also from the broader world that the academic reserve is a part
    of. All in all, I think this disturbance means the remaining Nerds are further
    driven away.'

  zh: 我要补充的是，在怪异书呆子的位置上，我注意到了学术界另一种类型的物种的激增：我称之为“失败的企业家”。这些人之所以走进学术界，并不是因为对真理的热爱，而是因为在其他不相关的原因下无法在公司环境中成功。但失败的企业家通常具有非常传统、企业化的思维方式。他们通常喜欢流程、行政工作，不断增加行政工作和流程以及指标和社会一致性。这种技能使他们能够在学术管理层中上升，并经常对怪异书呆子产生重大的影响和控制。面对这种变化的生存环境，怪异书呆子通常会陷入困惑和困惑的状态。其内在动机与新近施加的企业化秩序和对一致性的要求发生冲突，导致其竭尽全力地表现出其自然的倾向。不幸的是，这些努力通常会遭到失败企业家以及学术储备部分的广泛拒绝或直接抵制。总的来说，我认为这种干扰意味着剩余的书呆子更加被驱赶。

- en: Biology Professor Jason Sheltzer has an interesting [thread](https://x.com/JSheltzer/status/1744412783989473567?s=20)
    today that points in this direction. Through an ad hoc analysis, Jason discovered
    that while 66% of the top national winners at the Intel/Westinghouse Science Fair
    from 1990 to 2002 pursued careers in academia, this number dropped to less than
    a third for winners from 2003 to 2014\. Now, for this to support my and Nate’s
    observations, you have to assume the Science Fair winners are good representations
    of the Weird Nerd. I personally think that’s a valid assumption! If you scroll
    down in his thread, you will see indeed some illustrious names of current academics
    among these winners. I’ll add to this list recent Nobel Laureate [Katalin Kariko](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katalin_Karik%C3%B3),
    who describes in her book having scored 3rd in her country in the Biology Olympiad.
    This is the closest thing Eastern European countries have to a Science Fair.

  zh: 生物学教授杰森·谢尔策今天有一个有趣的[讨论串](https://x.com/JSheltzer/status/1744412783989473567?s=20)，指出了这个方向。通过一项临时分析，杰森发现，从1990年到2002年的英特尔/韦斯汀豪斯科学展的顶级国家获奖者中，有66%选择从事学术事业，但这一数字在2003年到2014年的获奖者中下降到不到三分之一。现在，为了支持我的和内特的观察，你必须假设科学展的获奖者是怪异书呆子的良好代表。我个人认为这是一个合理的假设！如果你在他的讨论串中向下滚动，你会看到确实有一些著名的当前学者的名字在这些获奖者中。我要补充的是最近的诺贝尔奖得主[卡塔琳·卡里科](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katalin_Karik%C3%B3)，她在书中描述自己在生物奥林匹克竞赛中获得了第三名。这是东欧国家最接近科学展的东西。

    do their research in those more entrepreneurial environments. It’s not ideal -
    in another [post](https://www.writingruxandrabio.com/p/can-the-markets-replace-academic)
    I explain that I do not think commercial research, even in small start-up settings,
    can replace fundamental academic research; still, it’s better than if they all
    went into Quant Finance, as Nate suggests.

- en: Now, there is nothing wrong with working for Google or Quant Finance. But if
    I think start-up research is not going to replace academic research, that’s even
    less the case for big company research, especially Quant Finance! There’s a real
    risk here that even start-ups will run out of stuff to build on if high-quality
    fundamental research will cease to be done in academia.

  zh: 现在，为谷歌或量化金融工作没有什么不对。但是如果我认为初创公司的研究不会取代学术界的研究，那么大公司的研究，尤其是量化金融的研究，就更不会取代了！这里存在着一个真正的风险，即即使是初创公司也会因为学术界停止进行高质量的基础研究而无法继续发展。
