    of generated artworks pictured below. I've tried to visualize the algorithms and
    provide some code samples. The code samples are written in a Typescript with some
    simplifications so that the code is readable on mobile and to make them more concise
    and easy to follow. The general algorithms can easily be ported to any language
    though, I have for instance done some [implementations using Rust](https://github.com/damoonrashidi/generative-art).

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The main driving force behind these flow field images is usually a noise function.
    Without regurgitating the [wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perlin_noise),
    a noise function is a function that takes a coordinate in 2d space (higher dimension
    noise-functions also exist, but are irrelevant for the purpose of this article)
    and returns a value in the range `-1..=1` such as points close together return
    similar, but slightly different, values.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The interactive illustration below shows how this works by uniformly sampling
    points in a grid and calling the noise function for that point. Note that the
    values have been rounded to one decimal for legibility, the actual values have
    far more precision. Click `Regenerate` to run the noise function again with a
    new seed to get new noise values.

    manner by translating the noise values into degrees and draw lines from a starting
    position and a few pixels following the degree of the noise value.

    disjointed and go off in seemingly random directions. Not at all the smooth effect
    we're going for.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It turns out that noise functions are pretty sensitive. You'd think that the
    points`(1.0, 1.0)` and `(1.0, 2.0)` would produce somewhat similar noise values,
    following the rule that points in close proximity yield fairly similar noise values,
    but they're not close enough to each other.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To combat this we can force our points to be closer together by just dividing
    our x and y coordinates by some smoothness constant. For example, the distance
    between our two example points was previously `1.0` for the y-axis, and `0.0`
    for the x-axis, for a total distance of `1.0`.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    end up with: `p1 = (0.01, 0.01), p2 = (0.01, 0.02)`, making the distance only
    `0.01`, but keeping the relation between the points the same.'

    the noise value `n` for that point and increment `P.x` by `cos(n)` and `P.y` by
    `sin(n)` as well as some extra pixels that represents the distance we want to
    travel in the direction of the field.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We did this in the previous examples by sampling points in a grid and and having
    a fixed line length. To approximate the effect illustrated in the images at the
    beginning of this article a bit better another implementation is necessary. First
    we need to pick a random point on the canvas and then ride the flow field until
    we get out of bounds.

    Start at any given point on the canvas an instantiate your line, move through
    the field just as before, but instead of drawing a new point at the given position
    add it to the points for the line. Stop the loop when the line has reached the
    end of the canvas and finally draw the line.

- en: So far not a lot of variance has been achieved. All results, no matter what
    the seed of the noise function is, will yield somewhat similar images. There are
    a few ways to combat this, one way is by warping the noise value a bit, resulting
    in lines exaggerating their turns, this is done by simply multiplying the noise
    value by some constant before applying the `cos()` and `sin()` functions.

    step as it progresses through the field. Shorter steps yield much smoother curves

    noise function is a bit complicated and out of scope for this article, but nothing
    is stopping us from writing a function that returns similar values for a given
    coordinate, that part can be done pretty easily.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: These home grown functions won't yield as random seeming results as a noise
    function but they will let us control the final output much more. They will also
    let us be much more creative in trying new things out now that we can draw lines
    that reliably follow a path.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: An easy first test we can do is simply taking a coordinate and return it's distance
    to another point that we'll call the `focalPoint`, just to see what would happen.
    This function would satisfy the rule that points close together yield similar
    values, making our lines nice and smooth.

    line would collide with another line.

    I'll show only one method and a small optimization to keep the solution somewhat
    performant.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Checking the [intersection of two straight lines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line%E2%80%93line_intersection)
    isn't too bad and can be done in O(1) time. Our lines aren't straight however
    so we'll have to be a bit more clever. If we go back to the beginning of how we
    drew the line, it started with stepping through the noise field and adding a point
    for each step. If we made that point into a circle by giving it same radius as
    the line and kept track of each circle, not just in the line but in all lines
    it's a lot easier to check if the circle we are about to draw overlaps any other
    circle.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    radii is smaller than the distance between their origo.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: These example illustrations are fairly small so we haven't ran into any performance
    issues when checking if our line collides with any other line... yet. When trying
    to make a larger image however, in a print-friendly size for instance, we'd end
    up with a lot of lines with a lot of points that we could potentially collide
    with, meaning that for every new point we add we must check collisions against
    all other points. This stacks up fast and will make your render times a lot longer
    than desired. A way to mitigate this is to only check against points that are
    close enough for us to collide with.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The simplest way of doing that is by dividing our canvas up into a grid of boxes
    and whenever we are about to add a new point check which box it would go in, and
    then only check against collisions with points in that box.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Time for another illustration. This time, move your finger or mouse cursor around
    to see which points belong to the same box.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now, with 100 boxes (10 across, 10 down) and if the points are distributed uniformly
    on the canvas, we end up doing 1/100^(th) as many checks that we did previously,
    increasing rendering performance by quite a bit! One thing to note however, is
    that if our boxes would be too small to reliably hold points with the radius of
    our lines then we'd start to get overlapping lines at the edges. This would also
    happen if a points origo was at the very edge of a box, causing its body to spill
    outside the boxes area. We could fix that by checking surrounding boxes for collisions
    as well, but that would mean we'd check another eight boxes besides the current
    one, increasing the search space a bit, but the result would be more exact.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A final optimisation we can do with this technique is that if our step size
    (the distance between each point in each line) is sufficiently small we could
    skip checking a few points in the box, since if our circle overlaps with one of
    the circles there's a high chance that it overlaps with some other circles as
    well. Now this might yield a less accurate result, but accuracy is not necessarly
    the end goal. Some small overlaps for a few lines might introduce some visually
    pleasing artifacts. Usually those kinds of details are *happy little accidents*.

    is one. The constant `7` might be too high in some cases, or could be increased
    even more, it all depends on the step size for the lines and can be tweaked to
    get a good balance between render times and correctness.

    either by some [Piet Mondrian Composition style](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composition_with_Red_Blue_and_Yellow),
    or recursively splitting the canvas into more and more refined polygons. After
    the canvas has been divided I assign each region a color and whenever a line spawns
    assign it the color of the region it spawned in.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    the variants that can be achieved using the fundamental techniques described.
    I highly recommend trying things out and experimenting, swapping a `cos()` for
    a `sin()` somewhere, or maybe even a `tan()` if you're crazy.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Try subdividing the canvas into subregions who all have their own rules, or
    maybe dive deeper into noise functions. Or have a small border around the canvas
    and let some small percent of the lines escape it. Why use lines at all? Why not
    circles or squares or blobs?
