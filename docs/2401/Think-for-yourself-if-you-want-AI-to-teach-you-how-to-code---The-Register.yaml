    the tools that suggest or generate source code for you have to be used wisely.

- en: Programming requires patience and persistence, especially at the start of the
    learning process when nothing makes much sense. The rules for writing code seem
    confusing. There are all sorts of punctuation marks and symbols that have to be
    used carefully. Missing a colon or a comma, or messing up the indentation can
    lead to errors, depending on the language used. Over time, with enough practice,
    it does click into place.

    and solving problems in sets of programming exercises. When I got stuck on a problem,
    it was very tempting to turn to ChatGPT, which would easily help me jump to the
    right solution. These types of assistants are good at generating simple code,
    and some of them can even give you a complete answer just as you're describing
    it.

    Having a virtual tutor on hand means students can ask for help at any time they
    want. But like all AI models, it can make mistakes and isn't always accurate.
    Initial tests showed it was able to answer about 88 percent of questions related
    to the curriculum correctly.

    students in other areas beyond homework. In a research paper [[PDF](https://cs.harvard.edu/malan/publications/V1fp0567-liu.pdf)]
    analyzing the duck debugger's impact, teachers at Harvard said their experiment
    building a virtual AI coding assistant has paid off. They believe "generative
    AI [can] bolster student learning, not merely disrupt it," and are looking at
    ways the technology can be applied in other subjects.

    and not computer science. I started learning how to code just before the latest
    generation of chat bots took off. Previously I would try to understand software
    concepts or fix bugs by, like many people, reading blog posts or searching for
    examples of similar code on sites like Stack Overflow. AI allows me to shortcut
    this process.

    my problem, I can now turn to a large language model for direct help. I'm learning
    so that I can better understand the technologies that others are using; these
    digital assistants get me up to speed faster than poring over multiple articles
    about, say, slices versus arrays, or leafing through other people's software projects.

    of a code base. If I copied and pasted an AI assistant's output into my source,
    it would often introduce new errors because it didn't fit with the rest of my
    program. Trying to fix these mistakes can be tricky, especially if you don't understand
    what has been generated. As a novice, it wasn't always clear whether the errors
    were because the code was just plain wrong or whether it was being used in the
    wrong context.

    AI if you want to be a competent software developer. But if you use it wisely,
    you can improve quickly and become a good programmer - and maybe it'll even be
    fun. ®
