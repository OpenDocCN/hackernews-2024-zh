- en: With the rise of photorealistic AI-generated images and deep fakes posted as
    real on social media, it's easy to falsely shape the news narrative. We tend to
    trust photographs and video in a way we don't trust other media, which makes it
    even more important that we can verify photos are genuine. And these three leading
    camera makers want to help regain this trust and presumably ensure that photojournalism
    remains relevant.

    for professionals like journalists and photo editors, whose work''s integrity
    is paramount. With so much AI-generated content all around us, this technology
    stands out as a reliable source of authenticity in a world where misinformation
    is common," [Brian Prince](https://www.linkedin.com/in/BrianPrince/), founder
    and CEO of AI educational platform [Top AI Tools](https://topaitools.com/about),
    told Lifewire via email.'

    to cameras embeds a tamper-resistant digital signature into every image captured.
    This contains data like date, time, location, and the photographer's name, and
    can be used to authenticate that the image has not been changed in any way.

    app](https://www.canon-europe.com/press-centre/press-releases/2023/08/reuters-new-proof-of-concept-employs-authentication-system/)

    from all staff and contributing photographers in order to satisfy itself that
    submitted photos have not been fiddled with. The reader of those publications
    could then trust that what they see is real, although, of course, you'd have to
    trust the editors of that magazine or news website.

    implications, especially as AI images become indistinguishable from the real thing,"
    [Gareth Barkin](https://www.pugetsound.edu/stories/beyond-wanderlust), dean of
    operations and technology at the [University of Puget Sound](https://www.pugetsound.edu/),
    told Lifewire via email. "But proving some photos are authentic is not the same
    as being able to clearly identify whether something is or isn''t an AI image.
    Images could have plausibly been generated by older gear, different photo equipment
    brands, or phone cameras."'

    photographers to prove that they are honest. It won't necessarily help stop the
    dissemination of AI-generated fakes on social media or by bad-acting or unscrupulous
    media outlets. When Israel invaded Palestine last year, the number of [faked images
    on social media was alarming](https://www.bbc.com/news/57111293).

    pictures from elsewhere, marked as taking place in Gaza. To add to the confusion,
    some AI-spotting tools [marked genuine photos as fakes](https://www.pcmag.com/news/ai-is-marking-some-real-images-from-the-war-in-israel-as-fake),

    it easy to do. You'd also have to deal with sources that claimed to have checked
