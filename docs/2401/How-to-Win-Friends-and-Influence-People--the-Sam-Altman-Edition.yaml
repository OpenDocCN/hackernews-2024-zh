    of networks and building your reputation and influence in business.

    book, ["How to Win Friends & Influence People."](https://www.businessinsider.com/lessons-from-how-to-win-friends-and-influence-people-2015-4)
    Business leaders like Warren Buffett say the book changed their lives. It's unclear
    if Altman has ever read it — his press people didn't respond to a request for
    comment — but it's clear that he at least practices some of its principles.

    A combination of self-doubt, giving up too early, and not pushing hard enough
    prevents most people from ever reaching anywhere near their potential."'
