IRS Tax Tip 2024-03, Jan. 22, 2024

IRS Free File is now available for the 2024 filing season. With this program, eligible taxpayers can prepare and file their federal tax returns using free tax software from trusted IRS Free File partners.

## Who's eligible for IRS Free File

Each IRS Free File provider sets its own eligibility rules based on age, income and state residency.

Taxpayers, including active-duty military, with an [adjusted gross income (AGI)](/e-file-providers/definition-of-adjusted-gross-income "Definition of adjusted gross income") of $79,000 or less in 2023 can likely find an offer from an IRS Free File provider that matches their needs. Some providers also offer free state tax return preparation. Those with an AGI over the limit can still file their return for free using Free File Fillable Forms.

To find the right IRS Free File offer, taxpayers can go to the [IRS Free File](/filing/free-file-do-your-federal-taxes-for-free "File your taxes for free") webpage.

## IRS Free File is safe and secure

Taxpayer information is protected from unauthorized access while it's sent to the IRS. IRS Free File partner companies can't share or use tax return information for purposes other than tax return preparation without the taxpayer's permission.

## No computer? No problem.

IRS Free File products support mobile phone access. Taxpayers can do their taxes on their smartphone or tablet.
