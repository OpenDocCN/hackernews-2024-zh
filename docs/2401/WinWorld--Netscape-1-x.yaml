- en: Netscape Navigator/Communicator was the first commercial web browser, displacing
    the free [NCSA Mosaic](/product/ncsa-mosaic). 1.0 was first released in December
    1994, and initially offered advanced features such as progressively rendering
    pages as they loaded. It quickly gained many other features and capabilities and
    became the most popular web browser in the mid 1990s. One reason for its popularity,
    it was licensed freely for personal and non-profit use, although companies were
    expected to pay for a license. It later competed with [Microsoft Internet Explorer](/product/internet-explorer),
    Opera, and Safari, and eventually was open sourced in to the [Mozilla](/product/mozilla)
    browser.
