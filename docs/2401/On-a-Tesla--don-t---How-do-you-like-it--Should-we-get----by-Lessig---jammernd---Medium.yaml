    of our cars and left the country on a sabbatical. When we returned, we bought
    a Tesla Model 3\. People were eager to ask about the car, then. Being asked yesterday
    made me realize: No one asks anymore. Obviously, in large part, that’s because
    (in some places at least) they have become as common as mud. (I was in Palo Alto
    last year. It seemed every other car was a Tesla). But in small part, among some,
    at least, the question is just embarrassing. To ask about the car is to trigger
    a question about a person. And that question about that person is just exhausting.'

    been living without a car for almost two years (gone for one, with a Zipcar stand
    and muni stop 1/2 a block away, and with Uber (back then) offering almost free
    rides). We had expected to stay without a car until my oldest went to college.

    is designed at human scale. When I twisted my wife’s arm to get her to try it,

    and you look out with a completely unobstructed view, complemented by an almost
    completely glass roof.'

    faster than anything I have ever driven—and without the 17–year-old-dropout-sound
    of a revving car engine. It drives with enormous confidence. All that plus the
    integration with an incredible charging network makes the idea of ever owning

    (except we had to pay $750 to remove the insanely loud squeaks from struts that
    had been improperly lubricated) — no oil, no broken parts. Just regular tire maintenance,

    car, it should know you, unlock the doors for you, and reset the seats and other
    internal settings for you (especially important when there’s a big difference
    in size between the two drivers of the car), and then you drive away.'

    car is relatively well known. But I’ve almost never been able to use FSD without
    needing to disengage it to avoid a serious problem. (For example, it knows to
    exit from the highway; it doesn’t know not to exit around an embankment at 55
    mph).'

    Sometimes (maybe 10% of the time), the car will recognize that you are trying
    to park. (It doesn’t seem to do this at all anymore, so maybe it’s been disabled,
    or a setting has been reset). It then gives you the option to allow the Tesla
    to park itself. But no one uses this function more than once (or twice, after
    giving the car the benefit of the doubt the first time). You press the function,
    and the car takes forever to calculate how to place itself between two other cars
    that are themselves not moving. It starts and then stumbles, pausing to recalculate.
    The process takes *forever*, during which time you should think: So this is how
    effectively it navigates two stationary cars while moving at less than ten mph.
    And now I’m supposed to trust it at 65 mph navigating through cars moving at the
    same speed? Are those physics easier?'

    you to pull it forward or backward through the Tesla app when you’re not in the

    imagine trying that, but who knows). I’ve tried to use this functionality a couple
    of times when squeezing between cars in a parking lot. It worked once, when outside,
    though it took forever to engage the car and get it moving. But most of the times
    I’ve tried this, the lot is underground, and the app can’t connect to the car.
    For some reason, likely security, Bluetooth isn’t enough for this functionality.'

    large iPad-like interface that controls all of the internal functionality of the
    car. I was originally skeptical about locating critical information so far from
    a direct view of the driver— speed, directions, etc. I’ve gotten used to that.
    More frustrating is the finicky functionality of almost everything — except the
    games and fart-machine. Those work fine (I’ve never actually thought that I needed
    a fart machine in my car, but pre-teens think it essential.)'

    After a recent update, all the stations disappeared from the app, so I was stuck
    on the NPR station I had last selected. But as NPR spends most of its time advertising
    — primarily NPR, or its sponsors—it has become a useless source of information.
    I was therefore excited that I could use my Spotify subscription in the car, and
    could listen to podcasts. But at least 40% of the time, I face a spinning circle
    as I try to get a podcast to load. Though I’m paying for “premium connectivity,”
    it is usually not connectivity enough to load the content I want to be played.'

    what you were listening to and always forces you to reconnect and reinitiate almost
    every time manually. I didn’t realize how unnecessarily annoying that was until,
    on a recent trip, I was driving in the cheapest Toyota rental I could get. After
    connecting my phone to the Toyota, it would connect automatically when I got back
    into the car and pick up where I was, not only with music (the only thing the
    Tesla can remember) but it also remembered that I was last listening to Audible
    and would automatically pick up with that. Exactly the functionality I want: Apparently

    these problems out. But these problems of the car are the product of distracted
    management. There seems to be no one at the top willing to look honestly at problems,
    and get them fixed. The Net is filled with stories of Musk overruling Tesla engineers,
    to the detriment of the car. It is a company that is governed by a board that
    still has faith in a CEO who pretends to CEO (yea, let’s make it a verb) two,
    maybe three of his gaggle of companies, while being the father of (is it?) eleven
    kids. I get that some people find overcommitment admirable. I think it means that
    in none of the roles — especially the father role—does the overcommitted deliver.

    (I discuss the type in [The Age of the Fantasist](/@lessig/the-age-of-the-fantasist-80b86f428d8f).)
    He’s a man of enormous wealth, surrounded by people who don’t tell him the truth,
    psychologically unconstrained by the truth, convinced he is a savior, and that
    the world can’t live without him. He’s Putin but without an army. He’s Trump but
    constitutionally barred from being President. His single obsession is to be the
    center of attention. Yet he actually apparently doesn’t realize just how embarrassingly
    inane his ideas actually are. Years ago, I admired Musk, because I saw only what
    he had done, and very little of what he thought. Then, I saw [a recording of him
    presenting an argument favoring a carbon tax](https://youtu.be/sUFwwlmxRsw?si=cM3eo579_P_FuKmx).
    The argument was right and true, but the presentation was totally banal. If a
    first-year grad student had given the same talk, he would have been asked to leave
    grad school. Musk then followed this up by endorsing the election of a party that
    is constitutionally committed to denying climate change. Apparently, lower taxes
    on rich people is more important than honestly addressing climate change.
