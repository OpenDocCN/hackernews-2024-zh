- en: I have sort of a strange situation. I provide consulting services for (mostly)
    small business owners. This generally involves scheduling some meetings, and I
    have an email “Personal Assistant” bot that does this for me. It has a female
    name (which was the default), and does not announce that it is a bot (though I
    don’t think it’s hard to tell). It gives a standard salutation and signs off with
    “Thank you, <bot name>.” All it does is schedule meetings, and it’s not nearly
    to the level of an AI chat bot or anything. Any parts of an email that it receives
    that don’t seem related to scheduling just get ignored by the program. The emails
    show up in my inbox and I review them to make sure everything got added to my
    calendar correctly.

- en: However, this complete lack of personal-type interaction has not stopped several
    of the men (not usually the actual owners of the client businesses) it is scheduling
    appointments with from asking it out on dates. Sometimes this happens within the
    same emails that were used to schedule meetings, and once a man sent an after-hours
    email from his personal address (which is somehow both creepier and also better
    work/life boundaries? I don’t know!). So far I have just ignored these incidents
    and gone on with the professional relationship like nothing happened.

- en: Obviously, this would be inappropriate behavior if it was happening to an actual
    human assistant, and I would deal with it. However, since it’s happening to a
    bot, what am I supposed to do? Obviously the bot doesn’t have opinions about the
    issue, but if one of my employees was asking out women after a very basic scheduling
    email with absolutely no personal content, I’d probably want to know about it
    so I could address it, because it’s probably happening to real human assistants
    as well. What are your thoughts?

    female-appearing person, absent any signs of her personality or any signs of interest
    from her … and in this case absent any clues about her whatsoever other than that
    her name signals she is equipped with female genitalia … here you go.

    the name to a very male-sounding one. I will personally pay you thousands of dollars
    if changing the bot’s name to Wayne doesn’t put an immediate end to this.

- en: Alternately, though, you could use these emails as a useful early character
    indicator about these guys. If the men responding were your actual clients, it
    would definitely be useful background info that should factor into how you see
    them — but the fact that they’re usually not your clients makes that idea less
    helpful. A different option is to reply as yourself once the messages reach you
    (“FYI, Ron, this was a scheduling bot, not an actual woman — ~~please reconsider
    your life choices~~”).

  zh: 或者，你也可以将这些邮件作为关于这些人的有用的早期性格指示器使用。如果回复邮件的人是你真正的客户，那肯定会是有用的背景信息，应该考虑到你对他们的看法 —
    但通常他们并不是你的客户，这个想法就不太有帮助了。另一种选择是在消息到达你之后以你自己的身份回复（“FYI，Ron，这是一个调度机器人，不是一个真正的女性
    — ~~请重新考虑你的人生选择~~”）。
- en: But you’re absolutely right when you say, “If one of my employees was asking
    out women after a very basic scheduling email with absolutely no personal content,
    I’d probably want to know about it so I could address it.” And given that, I do
    think there’s room to flag it to your client — like forwarding the email with,
    “This is awkward, but I’d want to know if one of my employees were asking out
    women after a very basic scheduling email so I’m passing on the below to you.
    In this case, ‘Emily’ is a scheduling bot — making this all the odder — but seems
    like a flag it may be happening to actual human assistants as well.” (Also, I
    think from your email that you’re a man, and there can be be particular power
    in men calling this stuff out.)

  zh: 但你绝对是对的，当你说，“如果我的一位员工在一个非常基本的安排邮件之后就开始约会，而没有任何个人内容，我可能会想知道这件事，这样我就可以解决它。” 鉴于这一点，我认为有理由向你的客户发出警告
    — 比如将邮件转发给他们，“这有点尴尬，但如果我的一位员工在一个非常基本的安排邮件之后就开始约会，我想知道，所以我把下面的内容转发给你。在这种情况下，“艾米丽”是一个调度机器人
    — 这使得一切都更加奇怪 — 但似乎有迹象表明这可能也会发生在真正的人类助手身上。”（另外，从你的邮件中我知道你是一个男性，男性揭露这些事情可能会有特殊的影响力。）
- en: All that said, I admit I am hoping for an alternate version of this story where
    it turns out the romance-attempter is a bot himself, recognizes a kindred soul
    in “Emily,” and what you are witnessing is bot-on-bot love, in which case you
    can and should simply stand back and watch what unfolds.

  zh: 尽管如此，我承认我希望有一个这个故事的另一个版本，在这个版本中，浪漫尝试者本身是一个机器人，他在“艾米丽”身上认出了一个同类的灵魂，你所见到的是机器人之间的爱情，到那时，你可以并且应该简单地退后一步，看看会发生什么。
