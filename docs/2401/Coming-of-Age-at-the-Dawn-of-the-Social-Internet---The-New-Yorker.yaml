- en: Like so many millennials, I entered the online world through AOL Instant Messenger.
    I created an account one unremarkable day in the late nineteen-nineties, sitting
    in the basement of my childhood home at our chunky white desktop computer, which
    connected to the Internet via a patchy dial-up modem. I picked a username, “Silk,”
    based on a character from my favorite series of fantasy novels, with asterisks
    and squiggles tacked on to differentiate my account from others who’d chosen to
    be Silks as well. The character in the books was a charismatic thief with a confidence
    that I, an awkward middle schooler, could only aspire to at the time. But the
    name was not intended as a cloak of anonymity, because most of the people I corresponded
    with on *AIM* were school friends whom I saw every day. Each evening, during my
    parentally allotted hour of screen time, I’d keep several different chats going
    simultaneously in separate windows, toggling between them when one person or another
    went AFK—“away from keyboard.” This was unavoidable in the age of dial-up, when
    the Internet connection would get disrupted any time a parent had to use the phone
    line. Being online wasn’t yet a default state of existence. You were either present
    on *AIM*, immersed in real time, or you weren’t.

  zh: 像许多千禧一代一样，我是通过 AOL 即时通讯进入在线世界的。在 90 年代末的一个平凡日子里，我坐在我童年家中的地下室里，面对我们笨重的白色台式电脑，它通过不稳定的拨号调制解调器连接到互联网。我选择了一个用户名，“Silk”，基于我最喜欢的奇幻小说系列中的一个角色，后面加上星号和波浪线，以区别于其他也选择成为
    Silk 的用户。书中的角色是一个魅力四射的小偷，拥有我这个笨拙的初中生当时只能梦寐以求的自信。但是，这个名字并不是为了掩盖身份，因为我在 *AIM* 上通信的大多数人都是我每天都见面的学校朋友。每天晚上，在我被父母规定的屏幕时间里，我会在不同的窗口中同时进行几个不同的聊天，当一个人或另一个人离开键盘时，我会在它们之间切换。“离开键盘”在那个时代是无法避免的，在拨号上网时，每当父母需要使用电话线时，互联网连接就会中断。在线并不是默认的存在状态。你要么在
    *AIM* 上，实时沉浸，要么不在。
- en: There were strangers online, too, and kids venturing into AOL chat rooms could
    easily find themselves creeped on or misled. It would still be a few years before
    members of the boomer generation became fully aware of the risks of letting their
    children loose on the Internet. But for the moment, among my tween cohort, AOL
    Instant Messenger felt like a kind of alternative society to the one we inhabited
    in the physical world. Away messages, the brief customized notes that popped up
    when a user was idle, became a potent mode of self-expression. Quoting song lyrics
    was big—Blink-182’s “All the Small Things” seemed like the pinnacle of sophistication—but
    it was considered a faux pas to copy lyrics that a friend had already chosen.
    Spotting a copycat, one might make use of another classic *AIM* move, the passive-aggressive
    away-message update. “Are you going to be on *AIM* later?” was a common refrain
    at school. It meant something like “see you later”—on the Internet, where we were
    still ourselves but with a heady new sense of freedom.

  zh: 网上也有陌生人，孩子们进入 AOL 聊天室可能会很容易地发现自己被偷窥或误导。在博默一代完全意识到让孩子们在互联网上自由活动的风险之前还有几年的时间。但在那一刻，在我和我的小孩同龄人中，AOL
    即时通讯感觉就像是我们在现实世界中所居住的另一种社会。离开消息是用户空闲时弹出的简短自定义说明，成为了一种有效的自我表达方式。引用歌词很流行—— Blink-182
    的 “All the Small Things” 看起来就像是成熟的顶峰——但抄袭朋友已经选择的歌词是被认为是一种失礼的行为。在学校听到类似“你晚些时候会在
    *AIM* 上吗？”这样的话是很常见的。它的意思有点像“待会儿见”——在互联网上，我们仍然是我们自己，但拥有一种令人兴奋的新自由感。
- en: My second home on the Internet was LiveJournal, an early online publishing platform.
    Rather than gossiping and dropping hints to one another in abstruse away messages,
    my friends and I wrote diary entries. Posts on L.J., as we called it, were visible
    to multiple people at once, so my writing there became a kind of public performance,
    a way of appearing more self-aware and eloquent than I was in person. Every evening,
    I trawled friends’ pages to see if they had posted and hoped that others were
    scoping mine in turn. One night, I stumbled upon the LiveJournal of a friend whom
    I hadn’t known kept an account on the site, and was mortified to discover that
    his most recent post criticized me by name. I had evidently complained about not
    being invited to a party, which the friend considered to be evidence of my jealous
    tendencies. I closed the Web browser before I could read any more, feeling foolish
    for not realizing that the kind of scrutiny I aimed outward in my online writings
    could be just as easily targeted at me.

  zh: 我在互联网上的第二个家园是 LiveJournal，一个早期的在线发布平台。与其在晦涩的离线消息中互相八卦和暗示，我的朋友和我写日记条目。我们称之为 L.J.
    的帖子可以同时被多个人看到，所以我的写作在那里变成了一种公开表演，一种比我本人更加自我意识和雄辩的方式。每天晚上，我浏览朋友的页面，希望他们已经发布了帖子，并希望其他人也在关注我的。有一天晚上，我偶然发现了一个朋友的
    LiveJournal，我不知道他在这个网站上有账号，而且惊恐地发现他最近的一篇帖子直接点名批评了我。显然我曾经抱怨过没有被邀请参加一个聚会，而朋友认为这证明了我的嫉妒倾向。在我能继续阅读之前，我关闭了网页浏览器，感到自己很愚蠢，没有意识到我在网上写作时对外界的审查也可能同样轻易地指向我自己。
- en: A slightly older high-school friend named Parker, a budding graphic designer,
    had built a Web site for herself that included a section for blogging. L.J. allowed
    us to write about ourselves for an audience, but the nascent world of blogs seemed
    like something different—an adult pursuit, for those who presumably had something
    worth saying. (Little did we know. . . .) My friend’s site was personalized and
    elegant, with intricate HTML page structures and clickable art that she’d made
    herself in Photoshop, which was then easy to pirate online. She posted thoughts
    on the artists and bands that she liked. Her Web site seemed like a curated museum
    of the self, built up gradually and carefully. I was smitten with the site, but
    also, of course, with her.

  zh: 一个年长一些的高中朋友 Parker，一个新兴的平面设计师，为自己建立了一个网站，其中包括一个博客部分。L.J. 让我们为观众写关于自己的东西，但博客的新生世界似乎是一种不同的东西——一个成年人的追求，为那些可能有值得说的东西的人准备的。（我们真是不知道。.
    . .）我朋友的网站是个性化和优雅的，具有复杂的 HTML 页面结构和可点击的艺术品，她用 Photoshop 自己制作，然后可以轻松在网上盗版。她发表了对她喜欢的艺术家和乐队的思考。她的网站看起来像是一个精心策划的自我博物馆，逐渐而谨慎地建立起来。我迷恋这个网站，当然也迷恋她。
- en: I pestered Parker to make me a blog, too. She eventually agreed and hosted it
    as a subdomain on her own URL, which in retrospect was emblematic of the power
    dynamic between us. The site has been dead for years, but using the Internet Archive’s
    Wayback Machine I was recently able to dredge it back up. Reading the blog (which
    I had aptly titled Verbal Diarrhea) was endearing and excruciating at once. I
    published angsty screeds about the boredom I felt growing up in the Connecticut
    suburbs, marooned in the woods without a driver’s license. “I don’t have any mystery
    in my personal life, so I make it up,” I wrote in one post. Parker and I carried
    out arguments in the comment threads, just the two of us sniping back and forth,
    cryptically, perhaps on the off chance that someone else was reading. “You killed
    me in public,” one comment reads, referencing some now-forgotten high-school incident.
    Parker and I were critical of each other’s narcissism, the way we thought every
    sign in the world pointed back to ourselves—which was a feature of adolescence,
    sure, but also a habit encouraged by the Internet, which had given every one of
    us our own audience, actual or imagined.

    Wayback Machine，我最近可以再次找回它。阅读这个博客（我当时巧妙地命名为口头腹泻）一时令人感动，一时令人痛苦。我在那里发表了关于我在康涅狄格郊区长大感到的无聊的痛苦诉求，被困在没有驾照的树林里。"我个人生活中没有任何神秘之处，所以我编造出来，"我在一篇帖子中写道。Parker
    和我在评论区展开争论，只有我们两个在那里互相抨击，晦涩地，或许希望有人在阅读。"你在公开场合杀了我，"一条评论写道，提及了一些现在被遗忘的高中事件。Parker
    和我批评彼此的自恋，我们认为世界上的每一个迹象都指向我们自己——这是青少年时期的特征，当然，也是互联网鼓励的习惯，互联网给了我们每个人一个自己的观众，无论是实际存在还是想象中的。
- en: I didn’t understand yet in middle school, but in the years that followed I began
    to think of my online presence as a shadow self. Those aware of it could see it,
    and I could see theirs—the reflection of their avatars and icons and away messages,
    the tone of their instant-message chats or L.J. posts. But, for other people who
    were not so online, it was still invisible, insignificant. I’ve been thinking
    a lot about this early version of my online self lately as I’ve been writing about
    latter-day digital culture and taking stock of just how much the landscape has
    changed. The so-called open Internet has consolidated today around a handful of
    platforms that serve users content according to the numbing logic of algorithmic
    recommendations and feeds. Passive consumption is encouraged. Every interaction
    is surveilled and commodified through targeted advertising.

  zh: 在初中时我还不太明白，但在随后的几年里，我开始把我的在线存在看作是一个影子自我。那些意识到它的人可以看到它，而我也能看到他们的——他们的头像和图标，离线信息，即时消息聊天或L.J.帖子的语气。但是，对于那些不太在线的人来说，它仍然是看不见的，微不足道的。最近，我一直在思考我这个早期版本的在线自我，因为我一直在写关于当今数字文化的文章，并且正在审视景观变化的程度。所谓的开放互联网如今已经围绕着几个平台巩固起来，根据算法推荐和订阅服务用户内容。被动消费是被鼓励的。每一次互动都通过定向广告进行监视和商品化。
- en: It’s easy to be nostalgic for the way things were when you were a teen-ager.
    I grew up online, but time inevitably moved on, and younger generations have become
    the prime demographic for a new wave of technology. As the writer Max Read recently
    [posited](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/21/opinion/internet-aging-gen-z.html)
    in the *Times*, perhaps millennials have simply aged out of the Internet. Still,
    I think something more fundamental has been lost for all of us as social media
    has evolved. It’s harder to find the spark of discovery, or the sense that the
    Web offers an alternate world of possibilities. Instead of each forging our own
    idiosyncratic paths online, we are caught in the grooves that a few giant companies
    have carved for us all.

- en: Gradually, I realized that the Internet was not just a localized community of
    people I knew in person but a vaster civilization, with virtual cities full of
    other people constructing and managing their own shadow selves. Early in high
    school, I began playing Ragnarok Online, a Korean multiplayer role-playing video
    game that allowed me to commune with thousands of other users playing at the same
    time. The game, a predecessor to ones like World of Warcraft, turned the Internet’s
    burgeoning interactivity into full color, motion, and sound, literalizing the
    idea of a “virtual world.” I was hooked; there are years of my life from which
    I have more memories of playing Ragnarok than I do of going to school. Still sitting
    in the basement of my childhood home, I was now hanging out with people from all
    over the world. The players from Thailand often wrote “555” in the in-game chat
    room, which I eventually gathered was phonetic in Thai for “hahaha.”

  zh: 逐渐地，我意识到互联网不仅仅是我认识的人的本地化社区，而是一个更广阔的文明，拥有虚拟城市，里面充满了其他人构建和管理自己的影子自我。在高中早期，我开始玩《仙境传说Online》，这是一款韩国多人在线角色扮演视频游戏，让我能够与成千上万同时在线的其他用户交流。这款游戏，类似于《魔兽世界》之类的游戏，将互联网蓬勃发展的互动性变成了全彩色、动感和声音，实现了“虚拟世界”的概念。我迷上了它；有几年的时间，我更多的记忆是在玩《仙境传说》而不是上学。仍然坐在我童年家的地下室里，我现在和来自世界各地的人一起玩耍。来自泰国的玩家经常在游戏聊天室里写“555”，我最终搞清楚了这是泰语中“哈哈哈”的发音。
- en: During study-hall periods at school, I headed to the library or the computer
    lab and covertly logged in to Ragnarok discussion forums. Any time I see a color
    combination of green and gold, the pixelated design of a forum called Merchant
    Guild still flashes in my mind. What we’d now call being “extremely online” was
    still a clandestine activity for nerds; there was no social capital to be gained
    from a facility with the customs of the Web. Talking in the forums, to players
    I knew only by their pseudonyms and avatars, was the first time in my life that
    I felt like other people were interested in my opinions. I had developed unmistakable
    expertise in such matters as which monsters to hunt to gain “experience” points,
    or why thief characters should always equip themselves with daggers. (I didn’t
    say it was useful knowledge.) My online shadow self possessed a sense of authority
    and agency that I lacked elsewhere.

- en: The Ragnarok forums sent me on my first trips down the online rabbit hole. The
    people I chatted with there would name-drop other sites that they frequented;
    exploring one led me to yet another. There was a forum about playing guitar (Ultimate
    Guitar) which sent me to one about the Dave Matthews Band (Ants Marching) and,
    soon enough, to one for disaffected Dave Matthews fans (UFCK, legendary for its
    cranks). Perhaps other teen-agers got the same feeling playing on a sports team,
    running drills or training in the gym together, experiences that I scrupulously
    avoided. I was inept, undisciplined, and unprepared for those collective activities—except
    online, where I didn’t need to exist in a body.

- en: By the time I was finishing high school, the digital world I’d grown accustomed
    to was starting to transform. The proliferation of home Wi-Fi was making it easier
    to go online. Cell phones, like the 2004 Motorola Razr, became trendy accessories
    and promulgated the language of text messages—like *AIM* chats that you could
    hold in your palm. Social networks as we know them today were emerging. MySpace,
    which launched in 2003, was the first Web site that my IRL friends introduced
    me to, having caught wind of it from their elder siblings. (Friendster, MySpace’s
    predecessor, seemed to be for an older crowd.) When I made an account, I was surprised
    to find that MySpace tethered my shadow self to my physical person. I was no longer
    just a pseudonym and a cartoon avatar; the site asked for my actual name and a
    photo of my face; it told me to list my interests for everyone to see. Before,

    （Friendster，MySpace的前身，似乎是为了更年长的人设计的。）当我注册了一个账号时，我惊讶地发现MySpace将我的网络荫影与我的真实身份联系了起来。我不再只是一个假名和一个卡通形象；网站要求我用真实姓名和脸部照片，要求我列出我的兴趣爱好供所有人查看。之前，上网感觉像是一个独自徒步旅行者，探索未知的领域。现在，我觉得自己像是在高速公路上为自己做广告牌。
- en: MySpace linked the digital geography of the Internet to the offscreen world
    in other ways. You connected your account to your friends’ accounts by “friending”
    them, building a map of your preëxisting IRL relationships, and the site prompted
    you to choose a “Top Friends” ranking of eight people whose names appeared first
    in the list. The feature became a source of drama—picking someone for your Top
    selection was no guarantee that they would pick you—but this wasn’t a problem
    for me, since I didn’t have more than eight friends in school anyway. Looking
    back at my long-defunct MySpace page, now populated by broken images and empty

    —— 选择某人作为你的首选并不意味着他们也会选择你 —— 但对我来说这不是问题，因为我在学校里本来就没有超过八个朋友。回顾我早已废弃的 MySpace 页面，现在只剩下一堆破碎的图片和空白的框架，我发现我在该网站上只有十五个“联系人”，包括
