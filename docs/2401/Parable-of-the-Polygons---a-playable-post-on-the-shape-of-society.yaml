    bias ever existed, being unbiased isn't enough! We're gonna need active measures.

    neighbors that are like them, they all mix together! Let's see this play out on
    a larger scale, when we change the amount of bias and anti-bias for all shapes.

    looks like. So, fellow shapes, remember it's not about triangles vs squares, it's
    about deciding what we want the world to look like, and settling for no less.
