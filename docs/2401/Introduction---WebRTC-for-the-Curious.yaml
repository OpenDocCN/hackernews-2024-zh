- en: This book was created by WebRTC implementers to share their hard-earned knowledge
    with the world. *WebRTC For The Curious* is an Open Source book written for those
    that are always looking for more. This book doesn’t settle for abstraction.

- en: This book is all about protocols and APIs, and will not be talking about any
    software in particular. We attempt to summarize RFCs and get all undocumented
    knowledge into one place. This book is not a tutorial, and will not contain much
    code.

    agnostic, and we have tried to remove any conflicts of interest.

    more. Other books cover individual topics in much greater depth. This book aims
    to teach you the entire system, at the cost of expert level details.
