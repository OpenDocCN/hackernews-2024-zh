    and support staff, the core Tachiyomi project will no longer be under active development
    due to recent events involving Kakao Entertainment Corp's threats to both myself
    and others that have been involved with the project.

    or perceived selfishness, please understand that this project has merely served
    as a simple hobby to many of us with no financial incentive and such events have
    proved unworthy of investing additional time and effort.

    around the world and that creators can truly share their creations in a sustainable
    and healthy manner for them.
