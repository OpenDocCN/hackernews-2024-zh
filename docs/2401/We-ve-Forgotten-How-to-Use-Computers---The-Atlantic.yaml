- en: 'Once upon a time, long before smartphones or even laptops were ubiquitous,
    the computer mouse was new, and it was thrilling. The 1984 Macintosh wasn’t the
    first machine to come with one, but it was the first to popularize the gizmo for
    ordinary people. Proper use of the mouse was not intuitive. Many people had a
    hard time moving and clicking at the same time, and “double-clicking” was a skill
    one had to learn. Still, anyone could put a hand on the thing, move it around
    on a table, and see the results on-screen: A little cursor moved along with you.
    “Pointing is a metaphor we all know,” Steve Jobs [told](https://archive.org/details/jobs-playboy/page/n1/mode/2up)
    *Playboy* in 1985\. The mouse was central to the computer’s populist future, which
    wasn’t yet assured at the time.'

  zh: 很久以前，在智能手机甚至笔记本电脑普及之前，计算机鼠标是一种新奇而激动人心的东西。1984年的Macintosh并不是第一台配备鼠标的机器，但它是第一台为普通人普及这个小玩意的机器。正确使用鼠标并不直观。很多人在同时移动和点击时遇到了困难，“双击”是一项必须学习的技能。尽管如此，任何人都可以把手放在上面，在桌子上移动它，并在屏幕上看到结果：一个小光标随着你的移动而移动。“指向是我们都熟悉的一种隐喻，”史蒂夫·乔布斯在1985年告诉*Playboy*。鼠标是计算机民粹主义未来的核心，这在当时尚未得到保证。
- en: 'But the Mousing Age that followed didn’t last for very long. By the 2010s,
    the device was clearly in a steep decline. It never went away, of course; the
    computer-peripherals giant Logitech still nets some $750 million in yearly sales
    of “pointing devices.” But the mouse has receded into the shadows and there adapted
    to a smaller niche, sprouting strange new features and accoutrements. The simple
    and iconic mouse morphology of the 1990s—the one you see in mouse emoji (🖱️)—is
    now a basic throwback. Newer species come with [pulsating lights](https://www.walmart.com/ip/BUGHA-Gaming-LED-Mouse-for-PC-Android-Linux-Mac-OS-USB-Wired/2433728809)
    or [die-cut air vents](https://hyperx.com/products/hyperx-pulsefire-haste-gaming-mouse?variant=41031680360605)
    or extra wheels and buttons. This is evolution through collapse: The basic functions
    mousing once performed are themselves headed to extinction. You operate a smartphone
    with your finger. Your computer is probably a laptop with a trackpad. People still
    use mice, but not as a matter of course. The mouse persists in contrast to the
    victories it helped bring about.'

  zh: 但随后到来的鼠标时代并没有持续太久。到了2010年代，这种设备明显处于急剧衰落之中。它从未消失，当然；计算机外围设备巨头罗技仍然每年净赚大约7.5亿美元的“指向设备”销售额。但是鼠标已经淡出人们的视野，并适应了一个更小的市场，发展出了奇怪的新功能和装饰。20世纪90年代的简单而标志性的鼠标形态——你在鼠标表情符号（🖱️）中看到的形态——现在已经成为基本的复古。新品种配备了[跳动的灯光](https://www.walmart.com/ip/BUGHA-Gaming-LED-Mouse-for-PC-Android-Linux-Mac-OS-USB-Wired/2433728809)或[模切通风孔](https://hyperx.com/products/hyperx-pulsefire-haste-gaming-mouse?variant=41031680360605)或额外的轮子和按钮。这是通过崩溃实现的进化：鼠标曾经执行的基本功能本身正朝着灭绝的方向发展。你用手指操作智能手机。你的电脑可能是带有触控板的笔记本电脑。人们仍然在使用鼠标，但不是当然的事情。鼠标存在与它帮助实现的胜利形成鲜明对比。
- en: Those victories were hard-earned. In the 1980s, Macs were uncommon, and Apple’s
    more popular computers, the Apple II line, didn’t use one. Microsoft had been
    selling a mouse of its own since 1983, but it remained an optional accessory even
    in the age of early Windows. One summer, in the early 1990s, I spent an internship
    in the financial-services industry operating a graphical user interface entirely
    with keyboard commands, and it was fine.

  zh: 这些胜利来之不易。在上世纪80年代，Mac是罕见的，而苹果更受欢迎的计算机，苹果II系列，并没有使用鼠标。微软自1983年以来一直在销售自己的鼠标，但即使在早期Windows时代，它仍然是一个可选配件。有一个夏天，早在上世纪90年代初，我在金融服务行业度过了一个实习期，完全使用键盘命令操作图形用户界面，而且效果很好。
- en: Just a few years later, though, enough pieces were in place to make the mouse
    mainstream. Windows had been widely adopted. The World Wide Web was spreading,
    and the mouse would be the board for surfing through its clickable links. More
    people bought and used computers, and they used them for more things—working,
    gaming, shopping, booking travel, paying bills. The tiny engine of this revolution?
    It was the mouse.

  zh: 然而，仅仅几年后，足够的因素已经成熟，使得鼠标成为主流。Windows 已经被广泛采用。互联网正在传播，而鼠标将成为通过其可点击链接浏览的板子。越来越多的人购买和使用计算机，而且他们用于更多的事情——工作、游戏、购物、预订旅行、支付账单。这场革命的微小引擎？那就是鼠标。

    as exactly that: a discrete, rectangular space. The mouse pad was a stand-in for
    the screen, and shared its borders. You could scroll by clicking on a scroll bar,
    but these two forms of navigation were in some sense disconnected. The subsequent
    emergence of the scroll-wheel mouse helped bridge this gap, even as our journeys
    on the endless ocean of the internet made scrolling more important.'

  zh: 但是当你把计算机的“桌面”真正当作一个离散的、矩形的空间时，使用鼠标总是更有意义的。鼠标垫是屏幕的替身，与其边界共享。你可以通过点击滚动条来滚动，但这两种导航方式在某种程度上是不连贯的。随后出现的滚轮鼠标有助于弥合这一差距，即使我们在无尽的网络海洋中的旅程也使滚动变得更加重要。

- en: 'Computers themselves spread beyond the boundary of the office too. The café,
    the train, the bed, the lounge, the Uber: Connectivity was everywhere. Where a
    mouse had once suggested knowledge work and a need for full engagement with computers,
    its meaning soon reversed. A desktop with a mouse attached came to signal lower-status
    jobs that were still tethered to a place. A receptionist might use a mouse; so
    might a quick-oil-change cashier, or someone working at an airline gate.'

  zh: 计算机本身也超越了办公室的边界。咖啡馆、火车、床上、休息室、优步：到处都是连接。曾经暗示着知识工作和对计算机的完全参与的鼠标，其含义很快就发生了逆转。带鼠标的台式机开始表示与一个地点相连的低地位工作。接待员可能使用鼠标；一个快速换油收银员，或者一个在航空公司门口工作的人也可能用到。

    one computer with a mouse included, and the only way to charge that mouse is to
    flip it over on its back, like an upended cockroach.) The diminishment of the
    mouse ought to be lamented, as some computing tasks—design work, for example,
    or database administration—still benefit from its precise control. But I think
    there is another, deeper reason for nostalgia: The de-mousing of computers has
    severed users from the action of computing. It has disconnected us from the feeling

  zh: 与此同时，普通的鼠标被抛在了后面。（截至 2024 年，苹果仅销售一款带有鼠标的计算机，而唯一充电该鼠标的方法是将其翻转到背面，就像一只倒置的蟑螂。）鼠标的减少应该受到哀叹，因为一些计算任务——比如设计工作或数据库管理——仍然受益于它的精确控制。但我认为还有另一个更深层次的怀旧原因：计算机的脱鼠化已经将用户与计算的行为分离开来。它使我们与控制的感觉断开了联系。

    or a folder, click to slide the icon to the trash, then release to drop it in.
    In the age of finger-scrolls and trackpads, that computing gesture feels bizarre.
    The once-routine activity of moving things around the screen—files to or from
    a disk, pictures into or out of albums, chunks of text in word processors—is simply
    harder to get done. Think about the UI somersaults you have to turn just to rearrange

    to what a mouse’s actions could embody. Clicking, moving, dragging—these were
    elemental ways of interacting with machines, and also ways of understanding them.
    A mouse could burrow into folders and pull out data in its teeth. It could make
    you feel like you were crawling in there with the circuits. But that way of connecting
    to computers is defunct. The screen is just a window now, and we’re only tapping
