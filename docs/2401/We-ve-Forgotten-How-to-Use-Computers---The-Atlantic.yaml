    the computer mouse was new, and it was thrilling. The 1984 Macintosh wasn‚Äôt the
    first machine to come with one, but it was the first to popularize the gizmo for
    ordinary people. Proper use of the mouse was not intuitive. Many people had a
    hard time moving and clicking at the same time, and ‚Äúdouble-clicking‚Äù was a skill
    one had to learn. Still, anyone could put a hand on the thing, move it around
    on a table, and see the results on-screen: A little cursor moved along with you.
    ‚ÄúPointing is a metaphor we all know,‚Äù Steve Jobs [told](https://archive.org/details/jobs-playboy/page/n1/mode/2up)
    *Playboy* in 1985\. The mouse was central to the computer‚Äôs populist future, which
    wasn‚Äôt yet assured at the time.'

    the device was clearly in a steep decline. It never went away, of course; the
    computer-peripherals giant Logitech still nets some $750 million in yearly sales
    of ‚Äúpointing devices.‚Äù But the mouse has receded into the shadows and there adapted
    to a smaller niche, sprouting strange new features and accoutrements. The simple
    and iconic mouse morphology of the 1990s‚Äîthe one you see in mouse emoji (üñ±Ô∏è)‚Äîis
    now a basic throwback. Newer species come with [pulsating lights](https://www.walmart.com/ip/BUGHA-Gaming-LED-Mouse-for-PC-Android-Linux-Mac-OS-USB-Wired/2433728809)
    or [die-cut air vents](https://hyperx.com/products/hyperx-pulsefire-haste-gaming-mouse?variant=41031680360605)
    or extra wheels and buttons. This is evolution through collapse: The basic functions
    mousing once performed are themselves headed to extinction. You operate a smartphone
    with your finger. Your computer is probably a laptop with a trackpad. People still
    use mice, but not as a matter of course. The mouse persists in contrast to the
    victories it helped bring about.'

    more popular computers, the Apple II line, didn‚Äôt use one. Microsoft had been
    selling a mouse of its own since 1983, but it remained an optional accessory even
    in the age of early Windows. One summer, in the early 1990s, I spent an internship
    in the financial-services industry operating a graphical user interface entirely
    with keyboard commands, and it was fine.

    mainstream. Windows had been widely adopted. The World Wide Web was spreading,
    and the mouse would be the board for surfing through its clickable links. More
    people bought and used computers, and they used them for more things‚Äîworking,
    gaming, shopping, booking travel, paying bills. The tiny engine of this revolution?
    It was the mouse.

    as exactly that: a discrete, rectangular space. The mouse pad was a stand-in for
    the screen, and shared its borders. You could scroll by clicking on a scroll bar,
    but these two forms of navigation were in some sense disconnected. The subsequent
    emergence of the scroll-wheel mouse helped bridge this gap, even as our journeys
    on the endless ocean of the internet made scrolling more important.'

    desktop computers. One year later, the iPhone brought the touch screen and its
    [gasp-inducing](https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/9kahkr/11_years_ago_steve_jobs_scrolling_on_the_first/)
    finger-scrolling into fashion. A new mode of connected computing had arrived.
    Desktop computers would persist, as would computer desktops. But now the screen
    was understood to be a tiny portal to a larger world. A mouse was too delicate
    to thrive amid such vastness.

    the train, the bed, the lounge, the Uber: Connectivity was everywhere. Where a
    mouse had once suggested knowledge work and a need for full engagement with computers,
    its meaning soon reversed. A desktop with a mouse attached came to signal lower-status
    jobs that were still tethered to a place. A receptionist might use a mouse; so
    might a quick-oil-change cashier, or someone working at an airline gate.'

    one computer with a mouse included, and the only way to charge that mouse is to
    flip it over on its back, like an upended cockroach.) The diminishment of the
    mouse ought to be lamented, as some computing tasks‚Äîdesign work, for example,
    or database administration‚Äîstill benefit from its precise control. But I think
    there is another, deeper reason for nostalgia: The de-mousing of computers has
    severed users from the action of computing. It has disconnected us from the feeling
    of control.'

    The once-routine activity of moving things around the screen‚Äîfiles to or from

    to what a mouse‚Äôs actions could embody. Clicking, moving, dragging‚Äîthese were
    elemental ways of interacting with machines, and also ways of understanding them.
    A mouse could burrow into folders and pull out data in its teeth. It could make
    you feel like you were crawling in there with the circuits. But that way of connecting
    to computers is defunct. The screen is just a window now, and we‚Äôre only tapping
    on the glass.'
