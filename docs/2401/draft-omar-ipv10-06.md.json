Introduction\n\n    IP version 10 (IPv10) is a new version of the Internet Protocol,\n    designed to allow IP version 6 [[RFC-2460](/doc/html/rfc2460)] to communicate to\n    IP version 4 (IPv4) [[RFC-791](/doc/html/rfc791)] and vice versa.\n\n- Internet is the global wide network used for communication between\n  hosts connected to it.\n\n- These connected hosts (PCs, servers, routers, mobile devices, etc.)\n  must have a global unique addresses to be able to communicate\n  through the Internet and these unique addresses are defined in the\n  Internet Protocol (IP).\n\n- The first version of the Internet Protocol is IPv4.\n\n- When IPv4 was developed in 1975, it was not expected that the number\n  of connected hosts to the Internet reach a very huge number of hosts\n  more than the IPv4 address space, also it was aimed to be used for\n  experimental purposes in the beginning.\n\n- IPv4 is (32-bits) address allowing approximately 4.3 billion unique\n  IP addresses.\n\n- A few years ago, with the massive increase of connected hosts to the\n  Internet, IPv4 addresses started to run out.\n\n- Three short-term solutions (CIDR, Private addressing, and NAT) were\n  introduced in the mid-1990s but even with using these solutions,\n  the IPv4 address space ran out in February, 2011 as announced by\n  IANA, The announcement of depletion of the IPv4 address space by\n  the RIRs is as follows:\n\n  * April, 2011:      APNIC announcement.\n  * September, 2012:  RIPE NCC announcement.\n  * June, 2014:       LACNIC announcement.\n  * September, 2015:  ARIN announcement.\n\n- A long term solution (IPv6) was introduced to increase the address\n  space used by the Internet Protocol and this was defined in the\n  Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6).\n\nKhaled Omar             Internet-Draft                   [Page 2]\n```", "```\n RFC                   IPv10 Specification            September 2, 2017\n\n- IPv6 was developed in 1998 by the Internet Engineering Task Force\n  (IETF).\n\n- IPv6 is (128-bits) address and can support a huge number of unique\n  IP addresses that is approximately equals to 2^128 unique addresses.\n\n- So, the need for IPv6 became a vital issue to be able to support\n  the massive increase of connected hosts to the Internet after the\n  IPv4 address space exhaustion.\n\n- The migration from IPv4 to IPv6 became a necessary thing, but\n  unfortunately, it would take decades for this full migration to be\n  accomplished.\n\n- 19 years have passed since IPv6 was developed, but no full migration\n  happened till now and this would cause the Internet to be divided\n  into two parts, as IPv4 still dominating on the Internet traffic\n  (85% as measured by Google in April, 2017) and new Internet hosts\n  will be assigned IPv6-only addresses and be able to communicate with\n  15% only of the Internet services and apps.\n\n- So, the need for solutions for the IPv4 and IPv6 coexistence became\n  an important issue in the migration process as we cannot wake up in\n  the morning and find all IPv4 hosts are migrated to be IPv6 hosts,\n  especially, as most enterprises have not do this migration for\n  creating a full IPv6 implementation.\n\n- Also, the request for using IPv6 addresses in addition to the\n  existing IPv4 addresses (IPv4/IPv6 Dual Stacks) in all enterprise\n  networks have not achieve a large implementation that can make IPv6\n  the most dominated IP in the Internet as many people believe that\n  they will not have benefits from just having a larger IP address\n  bits and IPv4 satisfies their needs, also, not all enterprises\n  devices support IPv6 and also many people are afraid of the service\n  outage that can be caused due to this migration.\n\n- The recent solutions for IPv4 and IPv6 coexistence are:\n\n   Native dual stack (IPv4 and IPv6)\n   Dual-stack Lite\n   NAT64\n   464xlat\n   MAP\n  (other technologies also exist, like lw6over4; they may have more\n  specific use cases)\n\n- IPv4/IPv6 Dual Stack, allows both IPv4 and IPv6 to coexist by\n  using both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses for all hosts at the same time,\n  but this solution does not allows IPv4 hosts to communicate to\n  IPv6 hosts and vice versa. Also, after the depletion of the IPv4\n  address space, new Internet hosts will not be able to use IPv4/IPv6\n  Dual Stacks.\n\n- Tunneling, allows IPv6 hosts to communicate to each other through\n  an IPv4 network, but still does not allows IPv4 hosts to communicate\n  to IPv6 hosts and vice versa.\n\n- NAT-PT, allows IPv6 hosts to communicate to IPv4 hosts with only\n  using hostnames and getting DNS involved in the communication process\n  but this solution was inefficient because it does not allows\n  communication using direct IP addresses, also the need for so much\n  protocol translations of the source and destination IP addresses\n  made the solution complex and not applicable thats why it was moved\n  to the Historic status in the [RFC 2766](/doc/html/rfc2766). Also, NAT64 requires so much\n  protocol translations and statically configured bindings, and also\n  getting a DNS64 involved in the communication process.\n\nKhaled Omar             Internet-Draft                   [Page 3]\n```", "```\n RFC                   IPv10 Specification            September 2, 2017\n\n[2](#section-2).  Internet Protocol version 10 (IPv10).\n\n- IPv10 is the solution presented in this Internet draft.\n\n- It solves the issue of allowing IPv6 only hosts to communicate to\n  IPv4 only hosts and vice versa in a simple and very efficient way,\n  especially when the communication is done using both direct IP\n  addresses and when using hostnames between IPv10 hosts, as there\n  is no need for protocol translations or getting the DNS involved\n  in the communication process more than its normal address\n  resolution function.\n\n- IPv10 allows hosts from two IP versions (IPv4 and IPv6) to be able\n  to communicate, and this can be accomplished by having an IPv10\n  packet containing a mixture of IPv4 and IPv6 addresses in the same\n  IP packet header.\n\n- From here the name of IPv10 arises, as the IP packet can contain\n  (IPv6 + IPv4 /IPv4 + IPv6) addresses in the same layer 3 packet\n  header.\n\nKhaled Omar             Internet-Draft                   [Page 4]\n```", "```\n RFC                   IPv10 Specification            September 2, 2017\n\n[3](#section-3).

Advantages of IPv10.\n\n    1) Introduces an efficient way of communication between IPv6 hosts\n       and IPv4 hosts.\n\n    2) Allows IPv4 only hosts to exist and communicate with IPv6 only\n       hosts even after the depletion of the IPv4 address space.\n\n    3) Adds flexibility when making a query sent to the DNS for\n       hostname resolution as IPv4 and IPv6 hosts can communicate with\n       IPv4 or IPv6 DNS servers and the DNS can reply with any record\n       it has (either an IPv6 record Host AAAA record or an IPv4\n       record Host A record).\n\n    4) There is no need to think about migration as both IPv4 and IPv6\n       hosts can coexist and communicate to each other which will\n       allow the usage of the address space of both IPv4 and IPv6\n       making the available number of connected hosts be bigger.\n\n    5) IPv10 support on \"all\" Internet connected hosts can be deployed\n       in a very short time by technology companies developing OSs\n       (for hosts and networking devices, and there will be no\n       dependence on enterprise users and it is just a software\n       development process in the NIC cards of all hosts to allow\n       encapsulating both IPv4 and IPv6 in the same IP packet header.\n\n    6) Offers the four types of communication between hosts:\n\n          - IPv6 hosts to IPv4 hosts (6 to 4).\n\n          - IPv4 hosts to IPv6 hosts (4 to 6).\n\n          - IPv6 hosts to IPv6 hosts (6 to 6).\n\n          - IPv4 hosts to IPv4 hosts (4 to 4).\n\nKhaled Omar             Internet-Draft                   [Page 9]\n```", "```\nRFC                   IPv10 Specification            September 2, 2017\nExpires: 2-3-2018\n\nSecurity Considerations\n\n   The security features of IPv10 are described in the Security\n   Architecture for the Internet Protocol [RFC-2401].\n\nAcknowledgments\n\n   The author would like to thank S.
