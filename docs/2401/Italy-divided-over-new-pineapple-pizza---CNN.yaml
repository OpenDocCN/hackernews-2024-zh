    abide by – and the most important of all revolve around food. Cappuccino after
    11 a.m.? Only for tourists. Spaghetti bolognese? A horrifying thought. Pineapple
    on your [pizza](https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/pizza-day-history-naples/index.html)?
    Heresy – at least, it was until now.

- en: But 2024 might just be the year that pineapple pizza cracks Italy, thanks to
    [Gino Sorbillo](https://www.sorbillo.it/), the renowned Naples *pizzaiolo* (pizza
    maestro) who has added the dreaded “ananas” to his menu in Via dei Tribunali,
    the best known pizza street in the world capital of pizza.

- en: 'Sorbillo’s creation, called “Margherita con Ananas” costs 7 euros ($7.70).
    But this isn’t your regular Hawaiian: it is a *pizza bianca*, denuded of its tomato
    layer, sprinkled with no fewer than three types of cheese, with the pineapple
    cooked twice for a caramelized feel.'

    or ways of preparing food purely because in the past most people didn’t know them,
    so I wanted to put these disputed ingredients – that are treated like they’re
    poison – onto a Neapolitan pizza, making them tasty.”

    (a local cow milk cheese from Campania), extra virgin olive oil, and fresh basil,

    – which he launched on social media this week – hasn’t gone down well with many.
    It has, Sorbillo said, started “uproar” with insults on social media, and his
    pizza even being discussed on national TV.

    had been used in Europe, and I found that it has been part of European [food]
    culture for a long time. So in reality we’re talking about a question of mentality
    and of taste habits.

    ago were never used. Now we use speck from Alto Adige, mortadella which wasn’t
    used 10 years ago, chopped pistachios, powdered olives, mozzarella foam, even
    jams. Why shouldn’t we rediscover pineapple? Pizza has been taking on a new life
    for the past five or six years.”

    offering, but added, “Things should be tasted first, and then you express your

    be a good product,” he said. “Instead, I put three smoked cheeses on, and it changes

    and yellow Italian datterino tomatoes, on a white base with smoked provola. He
    then filmed himself eating it triumphantly, surrounded by bottles of homemade
    ketchup, pronouncing it “good.”
