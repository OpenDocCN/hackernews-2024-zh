- en: '*The Future of Nuclear Energy in a Carbon-Constrained World* study is the eighth
    in the MIT Energy Initiative’s [*Future of*](https://energy.mit.edu/research-type/future-of/)
    series, which aims to shed light on a range of complex and important issues involving
    energy and the environment. A central theme is understanding the role of technologies
    that might contribute at scale in meeting rapidly growing global energy demand
    in a carbon constrained world. Nuclear power could certainly play an important
    role, and it was the subject of the first of these interdisciplinary studies at
    MIT—the 2003 [*Future of Nuclear Power*](https://energy.mit.edu/research/future-nuclear-power/)
    report. More recent studies have looked at the roles of CO2 sequestration, natural
    gas, the electric grid, and solar power. Following a [2009 update](https://energy.mit.edu/research/future-nuclear-power/)
    to the [original nuclear study](https://energy.mit.edu/research/future-nuclear-power/),
    now is an appropriate time to take a fresh look at nuclear, given advances in
    inherently safer technologies, a sharpened focus on the need to reduce CO[2] emissions
    in the energy sector, and challenges of cost and public perceptions of safety.'

- en: The study is designed to serve as a balanced, fact-based, and analysis-driven
    guide for stakeholders involved in nuclear energy. Policy makers, utilities, existing
    and startup energy companies, regulators, investors, and other power-sector stakeholders
    can use this study to better understand the challenges and opportunities currently
    facing nuclear energy in the U.S. and around the world. [The report](https://energy.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/The-Future-of-Nuclear-Energy-in-a-Carbon-Constrained-World.pdf)
    distills results and findings from more than two years of primary research, a
    review of the state of the art, and quantitative modeling and analysis.
