    US. Starting the business in the UK was an idea. First of all, there was some
    internal due diligence to do and I was recruited on the basis of, we were pretty
    sure about it, but we need to check a few things. They looked for a young executive
    team to do that, with the idea that they would be the same team that would actually

    in earnest, it had been running for 25 years, prior to me starting, in the format
    that it was. There were certain things about the business where it was obvious
    – speaking to people who had been on that journey for 25 years before I joined
    – that they were not likely to change in the future because they hadn’t changed
    in the previous 25 years. The first thing that struck me was an absolutely rock-solid
    commitment to gaining the trust of the customer, the employees, the suppliers
    and business partners. Almost every rule or method or procedure of the company
    was built around ensuring that. To be frank, I hadn’t seen something like that
    before.

    after your employees, that was something new to me. For example, having a mantra
    that says, let’s pay our people as much as we possibly can. I had been involved
    in the complete opposite before. What do we need to pay; don’t pay a cent more,
    would probably be the mantra of most of the other business conversations that
    I had been involved in.

    I’m not telling you I never saw a contract, because that wouldn’t be true, but
    you didn’t need it. If you said you were going to go do something and the supplier
    said the same, a handshake was undertaken and that was it. The contractual side
    was almost purely administrative, in order to satisfy rules and regulations of
    inter-country or inter-company dealings. That was new and refreshing and, somehow,
    such a strong set of ethics that ran through that, you gained a very quick confidence
    that, if these guys said they were going to do something, they were going to do
    it.

    we had to launch on the market by recruiting people at all levels, to run the
    logistics, to run the stores, to occupy the commercial jobs in the headquarters,
    buying product and that kind of thing. We did quite a bit of market surveying,
    looking into what were the normal costs, and we did our own business plan. The
    remarkable thing was, the business plan involved a level of revenue which was
    not really justified with profitability. What the business understood, from the
    previous two countries that it had entered – Austria in the 1970s and the US in
    the 1980s – is that when you come with an idea that you are going to sell 90%
    plus of your own products – not brands – you would try to match the quality of
    big brands and you would try to sell around a quarter to a third cheaper – depending
    on the product category – than those brands.

    what you were saying was, I’m here and, if I’m successful, I’m going to disturb

    were understandably not very enamored with the idea that Aldi should pitch up
    on its shores and try and do the same kind of thing that it did in the previous
    three countries, particularly in Germany, where supermarkets complained there
    wasn’t any room, financially, for them to operate properly because the margins
    and profits were so minimal, based on the fact that Aldi and Aldi lookalikes dominated
    the market. They wouldn’t want the same thing happening in the UK.

    what the business saddled itself with, in terms of a team and facilities. But
    it was always understood – and it wasn’t too difficult for new people joining
    to see the evidence – that this was being built for the long term. It would work
    long term and, therefore, it’s a question of just getting down to your job and
    your work, not worrying about whether this company will be here in two or three
    years’ time. I never encountered anybody who said, “The results are not that good
    on the P&L this month or this quarter or this year; I wonder if I will have a
    job next year.” That was never a discussion amongst anybody and I think I would

    He did it in many different ways. The first point was very clear and that was,
    turn the penny three times before you part with it. In other words, think about
    what you are spending the company’s money on, in a way that it is really important
    to you, as an executive. You can have the authority, you can have the responsibility,
    but I demand that you think about it very carefully. There is no cost too small
    not to concentrate on, to think about, is that really the lowest cost of operating.
    Many of his questions and discussions in board or conferences were to illustrate
    that point.

- en: It wasn’t always about not investing. In fact, it was often the opposite. If
    you invested a bit more, could you get a lower cost of operation? That manifested
    itself in the juxtaposition of, how come we have higher salaries than anybody
    else in the industry and, at the same time, there is constant messaging about
    being very careful with your spending. For him, it was always very clear. If you
    have the best people, you will get the best results, you will have the lowest
    cost of supervision and you will have the highest productivity and highest level
    of innovation in cost management.

    the salaries of people was never a way to save money. The way to save money is
    in expertise, in low levels of supervision, in high levels of autonomy and responsibility,
    which create a very productive environment. Interestingly, even though we had
    the highest salaries in the industry, when you looked at the ratio of cost to
    sales, it was the lowest. A typical supermarket would run on 7% or 8% of its revenue
    in salaries and we were 3%.

    culturally, they are able to develop their direct reports. And they live on their
    history. Even without personally experiencing some of the stories that I knew,
    I understood what it was that was important. If you built a new store and the
    car park gradient was more than 2%, this was an owner that could spot it before
    he drove onto the car park. He would claim, if the customer lets go of their trolley,
    while they are trying to fill their car up, the trolley will roll away, if it’s
    more than 2%. It will either hit another car or it will roll away so someone will
    have to go and collect it at the edge of the car park. All of that means that
    you will lose trolleys, they will get rusty, they won’t have the same life length
    and you will need labor to collect the trolleys. For him, 2% maximum car park
    gradients were a way of saving money and woe betide anybody who didn’t pay attention
    to that and take care of those kind of things.

    Karl Albrecht’s forte. Even after he stepped back a bit from executive responsibility,
    those stories were still so strong that no country manager, operations manager
    or expansion manager would not understand that rule. Not only understand it, but
    why it was so important. That is very interesting when the character and the persona
    is so powerful that the messages live on as though people are telling fables about
    their time, 20 years earlier in the business, when they maybe suffered because
    they made a mistake building a car park which had too much of a slope on it.

    of wrath. In the early days, after we had matured as a business and the UK had
    been going about 10 years, it had started to become quite profitable. When we
    became profitable, the ramp up of profitability happened very quickly. We crossed
    the line, in terms of being able to cover our costs, and we got to a scale where
    we could encourage ever better product quality; mixing cases so the range widened
    without costs being changed. There was almost an explosion of growth. It happened
    about the time of the financial crisis, where the whole country was beset with
    media telling you how you can save money, and one of the ways was to look at these
    new discount supermarkets.

    was that you sent your quarterly figures in, you had a call, a few days later,
    with the mothership in Germany, to just talk them through. I thought, this is
    going to be an exciting one because we really hammered our profit projections
    for that quarter. I was totally shocked; they were not impressed at all. They
    were asking questions like, are you too expensive? Why aren’t you reinvesting
    those margins in more attractive prices? Why are we suddenly satisfied with this
    market share and we are allowing potential beginning of stagnation of the business?

    The whole business had been built, for the previous 10 years, on ramping up the
    number of stores, getting more customers, getting more loyalty amongst the customers
    and you are suggesting, now, that we can make more money than other supermarkets

    of profit in that quarter; just focus on getting through that long-term strategy
    and goal. When I thought about it, I was pretty impressed with that. I went back
    to the whole team and explained, actually, we’ve not done it right here. We should
    take some of this profitability and not repeat it, but invest it in ever-lower
    prices. That was a very good lesson for all the management team, including me,
    as its leader, that we are on a journey here. Just because we are profitable,
    it doesn’t mean we’ve made it. Let’s get to 1,500 stores in the country.

    to share here. It was around the lack of willingness, on the part of Karl, to
    compromise on the quality of the store state. I remember us talking about the
    expansion and the incredible like-for-like sales that you were seeing in the mid-2000s,
    and there being opportunities to compromise on store formats and, perhaps, locations
    [which would have allowed for even faster growth]. I wonder if you could share
    a bit about that experience?

    longevity. We installed a sales floor, which was actually quite expensive. Remember,
    your whole life is focused on, can you do certain parts of the operation cheaper?
    Can you achieve a certain result and spend less money doing it? If you can, you
    should be seriously thinking about that. The floor that we put into the supermarkets
    was legendary. You needed to get a certain floor tile from a certain part of Italy
    because it was, virtually, non-porous. That meant you could spill beetroot juice
    or red wine on it, it could stay there for 10 minutes and you could just wipe
    it off. You need no preparation on this tile to be able to do that. It’s just
    a really, really dense format. It can also take the weight of one kilonewton.
    That means you can point load a ton on that floor and you can’t break it. But
    it’s very expensive. Worse than that, it’s bloody difficult to lay. You really
    need a good floor layer. The average Joe would make a bad job of it; it wouldn’t
    be even and you would hear the trolleys going clunk, clunk, clunk as they hit
    the edges of the tiles, if it wasn’t completely flat.
  id: totrans-35
  prefs: []

- en: We found other floors, which didn’t have quite the same longevity, that were
    about 30% cheaper and that was a big part of the construction of the store. Of
    course, Mr Albrecht was keen to listen to the story but, interestingly, he never
    got involved in any kind of products; he never got involved in any kind of marketing
    schemes. But if you wanted to alter the floor, which was the same floor everywhere
    in the world, for him, that was a big deal. What he wanted to know was, what is
    the 30 year life cost of this floor, including the cost of cleaning, because you
    can just whizz over the floor we laid. In 22 minutes, you could do 760 square
    meters, with a floor cleaning machine. Were you still going to be able to do that
    or was it going to take 30 minutes? How many times will you have to repair this
    floor and where is the evidence?
  id: totrans-36
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In the end, he was right. The 30-year cost of this floor was cheaper, if you
    stay with the existing floor tile. For him, it was just common sense. The store
    is going to be there for 30 years; we’ve invested in a location; we’ve built the
    store itself. Why do you need to bring yourself problems with the floor which
    is the most difficult thing to fix, in a retail store. When the floor is a mess,
    you need to cordon off areas for several days, to be able to fix it and you don’t
    really have several days. This is a seven day a week operation and that floor
    just needs to perform, for 30 years.
  id: totrans-37

    the floor for 30 years and it needs no maintenance. Don’t bring me an opportunity
    for building it for 20 years, and it then needs a lot of maintenance, and save
    some money at the beginning, if you’re not going to have the lowest cost over
    30 years.

    you start to pay the price for not putting the investment in, in the first place.

    was the vast majority of the stores in the startup phase, or the first 20 years
    – encouraged that you had the perfect productivity. You built them yourself, they
    were all exactly the same and the whole building was ergonomically perfect for
    the operation. In those stores, his attention to detail and his demand for everybody’s
    attention to detail, was absolutely non-negotiable. If you couldn’t get the store
    to the right shape, if you couldn’t get the loading bay in the right place, if
    you couldn’t get the entrance to the store in the right place because of some
    particular about the site, just forget it; just go somewhere else. Don’t tell

    is a lot of best practice which talks about you organize fixed salaries and how
    you organize incentives to align managers with the company goals. Maybe I’m going
    to shock you because I don’t think we’ve ever talked about this before, but across
    my 23 years, there were no – zero – incentive schemes. Bar one, but I need to
    explain that to you.

    early stages of your career. It flattened out as you went to become more and more
    senior. It was never uncompetitive, but the gap between the market for someone
    who was 25 years in the industry, and the Aldi salary, was much smaller after
    25 years than it was at the beginning. There was good sense in that. If you want
    the very best people, you need to offer the very best package at the beginning.
    Once you’ve got them, your job is to make sure their careers are exciting, make
    sure that their careers are really motivating and to give them the opportunity
    to really realize their potential.

    kinds of experience to me – 20 to 30 years plus – they were motivated by the opportunity
    to work in a style that they felt really, personally, comfortable with. They not
    only identified with the culture but they actually sold that culture to new people
    and then your level of engagement is on a very high level if you are actually
    selling it yourself. It wasn’t so much about, am I earning more than I would do
    in any other position, although I never saw a circumstance where somebody would
    have said, actually, if I switch to company Y, I would earn 20% more.

    of your ability, it fits within the culture and there was a lot of feedback. To
    keep this culture understood, there was a lot of, either, one on one teaching
    with your boss, or there was a lot of time spent on conferences for people of
    the same level, within the organization, to share best practices, to share stories
    of successes or failures, which just seemed to always end up in consolidation
    of the culture. I’m very quickly moving from financial compensation to, I would
    say, emotional compensation, but with a salary that everybody considered to be
    very fair.

    when the country managers understood their pay increase, on an annual basis, we
    all got told in a group. There was no one on one discussion; it was all done in
    a group. You didn’t need to sneakily find out, I wonder what they pay Jim in the
    US or Joe in Australia; you knew. You also knew all the salaries of the people
    junior to you. You didn’t know the salaries of people senior to you, out of respect,
    but you knew all the salaries of your peer group and those underneath you. I never
    once found that that somehow reduced the motivation of somebody.

    in the company were those who enjoyed this responsibility, not only for producing
    results, but for building teams and businesses in the way that Aldi wanted. There
    was a pre-selection, if you like, without you even realizing it, until you look
    back. That was a quality that was prized by those who were choosing individuals
    that progressed in the business.

    System. It is a kind of rulebook on how you must treat people and how you should
    expect to be treated yourself, in leadership terms. One of the core principles
    of this Aldi Management System was, never give responsibility without giving an
    appropriate authority so that there is no chance that you could blame any lack
    of success on someone interfering or some kind of bureaucratic rule that meant,
    I’d like to do X, I’m responsible for it, but I don’t have the authority to change
    things.

    in your own mind by what you know to be a very strong culture, which you identify
    with, personally – you would subscribe to that culture, naturally, even if it
    wasn’t imposed upon you – then you get a bunch of people that behave as if it
    is ‘my part of the business’ and I have to take care of it. I have to make sure
    that everyone who works for and with me also understands these rules. It is an
    incredibly clever way of motivating leaders from within and it’s very powerful.
    When you work for somebody who has got this this strong sense of ethically correct
    ways of doing things, if you are normal person, it’s quite hard to say, I don’t
    want to do that; I think I can screw him or get away with something. The minute
    you found somebody who was even thinking that way, you start to come to the conclusion
    that, perhaps, that is not the right person for my team, or certainly not the
    right person I could trust with that level of authority in the future. Self-cleansing

    be considered the hard choices in retail, such as how you treat your suppliers,
    how you manage margins, do you give more of the benefits of scale back to the
    customer, it doesn’t sound as if it was particularly hard, within the Aldi context,
    to make those [long-term] choices?

- en: You’re right. Everything seemed to be very easy to decide in an ‘Aldi logic’.
    The truth is, there were some times when you had to make some kind of hard choices.
    When you feel responsible for a business, you often have two or three ways to
    tackle a problem. There are several examples. Especially in the UK, which was
    a very strong, very rich and successful retail supermarket industry, with four
    top players, who were considered amongst the best in the world at producing a
    very good result for their customers, a very good result for their shareholders
    and, by any kind of benchmark practices, a high level of profitability for the
    investment that was made, there was one thing that became very obvious. That was
    that because there was so much legitimate but, nevertheless, tough practices to
    keep Aldi out of the market and having that very nice profitable party disturbed,
    you began to really value the private-label suppliers that you had, in a way that
    would be suicidal to not organize the relationship in a way that was win:win,
    for both sides.

    small manufacturers, who understood the growth story and growth plans and were
    prepared to grow with you. Sometimes, we used a little bit of our own money to
    help them; we made investments in those production factories, to enlarge them
    or put more sophisticated plant in. Sometimes, we wrote contracts that were good
    enough for the business to take to the bank and say, I have this long-term contract;
    providing I don’t muck it up, I’ve got this business in the bag for the next five
    years; lend us the money to extend the factory or improve the plant.

    you know that, one day, maybe I will need more than one supplier, you have to
    think very carefully about whether or not to do that. This guy has been with me
    for the last 10 years. Everything I have asked of that supplier, he has done.
    Now I have the opportunity to maybe take 25% of that business away and divide
    it amongst two. I’m probably going to need to do that at some stage because, just
    out of supply security, you can’t put all your eggs in one basket and you’ve already
    explained that to the supplier. But it wasn’t now.

    as to what you do now. Do I retract and go back on a promise that I made and risk
    that the supplier that I have been with for the past 10 years loses a bit of faith
    that, if I can retract that, I can retract other things? At the same time, this
    opportunity needed to come anyway; it has just come three years too early. These
    were hard choices, to be honest. Lidl is also there and, if you don’t make the
    deal, you know where the next address is going to be for that manufacturer.

    guys in Germany and say, this is how I see things; this is what I think I should
    do; these are all the facts. Do you support this? Generally, always sticking to
    our promises was the way forward. Sometimes, if we went down a slightly different
    path, we made sure that there was some other compensation which was really fair
    and reasonable and, perhaps, a little bit unexpected on the part of the supplier.

    clear and easy to do. Not only did we have Lidl breathing down our neck – and
    that still is the case – but there was also Netto, at the time, which was wanting
    to be a third leg of the discount scene, in the UK and all the supermarkets, despite
    what they say, were also very interested in our business model and were thinking
    about, how can we either copy some of that or do something similar ourselves?
    All those suppliers who, potentially, might have been able to fall out with us,
    could then easily have been potential suppliers for the big four who ramped up
    their own private label programs.
