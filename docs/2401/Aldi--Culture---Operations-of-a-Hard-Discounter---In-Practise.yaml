    US. Starting the business in the UK was an idea. First of all, there was some
    internal due diligence to do and I was recruited on the basis of, we were pretty
    sure about it, but we need to check a few things. They looked for a young executive

    and didn’t look back from that point on. Perhaps I should mention, I finished

    in earnest, it had been running for 25 years, prior to me starting, in the format
    that it was. There were certain things about the business where it was obvious
    – speaking to people who had been on that journey for 25 years before I joined
    – that they were not likely to change in the future because they hadn’t changed
    in the previous 25 years. The first thing that struck me was an absolutely rock-solid
    commitment to gaining the trust of the customer, the employees, the suppliers
    and business partners. Almost every rule or method or procedure of the company
    was built around ensuring that. To be frank, I hadn’t seen something like that
    before.

- en: Yes, looking after your customers is a standard prerequisite for a good retail
    company, so that wasn’t so different or difficult to understand. But really looking
    after your employees, that was something new to me. For example, having a mantra
    that says, let’s pay our people as much as we possibly can. I had been involved
    in the complete opposite before. What do we need to pay; don’t pay a cent more,
    would probably be the mantra of most of the other business conversations that

    I’m not telling you I never saw a contract, because that wouldn’t be true, but
    you didn’t need it. If you said you were going to go do something and the supplier
    said the same, a handshake was undertaken and that was it. The contractual side
    was almost purely administrative, in order to satisfy rules and regulations of
    inter-country or inter-company dealings. That was new and refreshing and, somehow,
    such a strong set of ethics that ran through that, you gained a very quick confidence
    that, if these guys said they were going to do something, they were going to do

    we had to launch on the market by recruiting people at all levels, to run the
    logistics, to run the stores, to occupy the commercial jobs in the headquarters,
    buying product and that kind of thing. We did quite a bit of market surveying,
    looking into what were the normal costs, and we did our own business plan. The
    remarkable thing was, the business plan involved a level of revenue which was
    not really justified with profitability. What the business understood, from the
    previous two countries that it had entered – Austria in the 1970s and the US in
    the 1980s – is that when you come with an idea that you are going to sell 90%
    plus of your own products – not brands – you would try to match the quality of
    big brands and you would try to sell around a quarter to a third cheaper – depending
    on the product category – than those brands.

  zh: 我有很多故事可以支持这一点。当然，第一件事是，我们不得不通过招聘各个层面的人来进入市场，管理物流，管理商店，在总部占据商业职位，购买产品等等。我们进行了相当多的市场调查，研究了什么是正常的成本，然后制定了我们自己的商业计划。值得注意的是，商业计划涉及的收入水平实际上并不能真正证明其盈利能力。该企业从其进入的前两个国家
    - 1970年代的奥地利和1980年代的美国 - 了解到，当你提出一个想法，即你将销售自己产品的90%以上 - 而不是品牌 - 你将尝试与大品牌的质量相匹配，并且你将尝试以大约四分之一到三分之一的更低价格出售
    - 根据产品类别而定 - 比这些品牌。

    what you were saying was, I’m here and, if I’m successful, I’m going to disturb

    were understandably not very enamored with the idea that Aldi should pitch up
    on its shores and try and do the same kind of thing that it did in the previous
    three countries, particularly in Germany, where supermarkets complained there
    wasn’t any room, financially, for them to operate properly because the margins

    in their business longevity, that they would do that in a way that was not really
    affordable. There was zero chance of making money in the first five years, with
    what the business saddled itself with, in terms of a team and facilities. But
    it was always understood – and it wasn’t too difficult for new people joining
    to see the evidence – that this was being built for the long term. It would work
    long term and, therefore, it’s a question of just getting down to your job and
    your work, not worrying about whether this company will be here in two or three
    years’ time. I never encountered anybody who said, “The results are not that good
    on the P&L this month or this quarter or this year; I wonder if I will have a

- en: It wasn’t always about not investing. In fact, it was often the opposite. If
    you invested a bit more, could you get a lower cost of operation? That manifested
    itself in the juxtaposition of, how come we have higher salaries than anybody
    else in the industry and, at the same time, there is constant messaging about
    being very careful with your spending. For him, it was always very clear. If you

- en: For him, investing in really good people was not a way to save money; reducing
    the salaries of people was never a way to save money. The way to save money is
    in expertise, in low levels of supervision, in high levels of autonomy and responsibility,
    which create a very productive environment. Interestingly, even though we had
    the highest salaries in the industry, when you looked at the ratio of cost to
    sales, it was the lowest. A typical supermarket would run on 7% or 8% of its revenue
    in salaries and we were 3%.

    I understood what it was that was important. If you built a new store and the
    car park gradient was more than 2%, this was an owner that could spot it before
    he drove onto the car park. He would claim, if the customer lets go of their trolley,
    while they are trying to fill their car up, the trolley will roll away, if it’s
    more than 2%. It will either hit another car or it will roll away so someone will
    have to go and collect it at the edge of the car park. All of that means that
    you will lose trolleys, they will get rusty, they won’t have the same life length
    and you will need labor to collect the trolleys. For him, 2% maximum car park

    those stories were still so strong that no country manager, operations manager
    or expansion manager would not understand that rule. Not only understand it, but
    why it was so important. That is very interesting when the character and the persona
    is so powerful that the messages live on as though people are telling fables about

- en: There were two directions that that whole program took. The first is, again,
    longevity. We installed a sales floor, which was actually quite expensive. Remember,
    your whole life is focused on, can you do certain parts of the operation cheaper?
    Can you achieve a certain result and spend less money doing it? If you can, you
    should be seriously thinking about that. The floor that we put into the supermarkets
    was legendary. You needed to get a certain floor tile from a certain part of Italy
    because it was, virtually, non-porous. That meant you could spill beetroot juice
    or red wine on it, it could stay there for 10 minutes and you could just wipe
    it off. You need no preparation on this tile to be able to do that. It’s just
    a really, really dense format. It can also take the weight of one kilonewton.
    That means you can point load a ton on that floor and you can’t break it. But
    it’s very expensive. Worse than that, it’s bloody difficult to lay. You really
    need a good floor layer. The average Joe would make a bad job of it; it wouldn’t
    be even and you would hear the trolleys going clunk, clunk, clunk as they hit
    the edges of the tiles, if it wasn’t completely flat.

  zh: 这个整个项目有两个方向。第一个是长久性。我们安装了一个销售地面，这实际上是相当昂贵的。记住，你的整个生活都集中在一个问题上，你是否能更便宜地做某些操作的某些部分？你是否能够以更少的钱达到某个结果？如果可以的话，你应该认真考虑一下。我们在超市里铺设的地板是传奇的。你需要从意大利的某个特定地方获取某种地板瓷砖，因为它几乎是非多孔的。这意味着你可以把甜菜汁或红酒溅在上面，它可以在那里停留10分钟，然后你可以擦掉。你不需要对这块瓷砖做任何准备就能做到这一点。它只是一种非常非常密集的格式。它还可以承受1千牛的重量。这意味着你可以在那个地板上点载荷一吨，你不能打破它。但是它非常昂贵。更糟糕的是，它非常难铺设。你真的需要一个优秀的地板铺设工。普通人会把它弄得很糟糕；如果不是完全平坦的话，你会听到手推车撞到瓷砖边缘时发出咯噔、咯噔、咯噔的声音。
- en: We found other floors, which didn’t have quite the same longevity, that were
    about 30% cheaper and that was a big part of the construction of the store. Of
    course, Mr Albrecht was keen to listen to the story but, interestingly, he never
    got involved in any kind of products; he never got involved in any kind of marketing
    schemes. But if you wanted to alter the floor, which was the same floor everywhere
    in the world, for him, that was a big deal. What he wanted to know was, what is
    the 30 year life cost of this floor, including the cost of cleaning, because you
    can just whizz over the floor we laid. In 22 minutes, you could do 760 square
    meters, with a floor cleaning machine. Were you still going to be able to do that
    or was it going to take 30 minutes? How many times will you have to repair this
    floor and where is the evidence?

- en: In the end, he was right. The 30-year cost of this floor was cheaper, if you
    stay with the existing floor tile. For him, it was just common sense. The store
    is going to be there for 30 years; we’ve invested in a location; we’ve built the
    store itself. Why do you need to bring yourself problems with the floor which
    is the most difficult thing to fix, in a retail store. When the floor is a mess,
    you need to cordon off areas for several days, to be able to fix it and you don’t
    really have several days. This is a seven day a week operation and that floor
    just needs to perform, for 30 years.

- en: Again, it was this absolute solid logic that he had that the idea is to build
    the floor for 30 years and it needs no maintenance. Don’t bring me an opportunity

  zh: 你说得对。在‘阿尔迪逻辑’中，一切似乎都很容易决定。事实上，有些时候你不得不做出一些艰难的选择。当你感到对一家企业负责时，你通常有两三种解决问题的方式。有几个例子。特别是在英国，那是一个非常强大、非常富有和成功的零售超市业，有四家顶尖玩家，被认为是世界上生产出非常好的结果给他们的顾客，为他们的股东带来非常好的结果，并且通过任何一种基准实践，为所做的投资带来高水平的盈利能力的最佳人选之一，有一件事情变得非常明显。那就是因为有太多合法但仍然艰难的做法来阻止阿尔迪进入市场，并且打扰了那个非常美好的有利可图的聚会，你开始真正重视你所拥有的私人标签供应商，以一种方式组织关系是双赢的方式，对双方都有利，否则是自杀性的。
- en: You had a situation where you built, from the beginning, a relationship with
    small manufacturers, who understood the growth story and growth plans and were
    prepared to grow with you. Sometimes, we used a little bit of our own money to
    help them; we made investments in those production factories, to enlarge them
    or put more sophisticated plant in. Sometimes, we wrote contracts that were good
    enough for the business to take to the bank and say, I have this long-term contract;
    providing I don’t muck it up, I’ve got this business in the bag for the next five
    years; lend us the money to extend the factory or improve the plant.

  zh: 你曾经建立了一个与小型制造商的关系，从一开始就理解了增长故事和增长计划，并准备与你一起成长的情况。有时，我们会用一点自己的钱来帮助他们；我们在这些生产工厂投资，扩大它们或增设更复杂的工厂。有时，我们签订了足够好的合同，业务可以拿到银行去说，我有这个长期合同；只要我不搞砸它，接下来的五年我就有这个生意；借给我们钱来扩大工厂或改善工厂设施。

    branded quality product at lower prices because of the method and assurability
    of the business relationship.

- en: If somebody came in and said, I can do that and I can do it for 10% less, and
    you know that, one day, maybe I will need more than one supplier, you have to
    think very carefully about whether or not to do that. This guy has been with me
    for the last 10 years. Everything I have asked of that supplier, he has done.
    Now I have the opportunity to maybe take 25% of that business away and divide
    it amongst two. I’m probably going to need to do that at some stage because, just
    out of supply security, you can’t put all your eggs in one basket and you’ve already
    explained that to the supplier. But it wasn’t now.

  zh: 如果有人进来说，我可以做到这一点，而且我可以以比现在便宜10%的价格做到，而你知道，也许有一天，我会需要不止一个供应商，你必须非常仔细地考虑是否要这样做。这个人已经和我在一起十年了。我向那个供应商提出的所有要求，他都做到了。现在我有机会可能把那个业务的25%拿走，分给两个供应商。我可能在某个阶段需要做到这一点，因为，光是为了供应保障，你不能把所有的鸡蛋都放在一个篮子里，你已经向供应商解释过这一点。但现在还不是时候。
- en: The opportunity stares at you, there and then, and you have to make the decision
    as to what you do now. Do I retract and go back on a promise that I made and risk
    that the supplier that I have been with for the past 10 years loses a bit of faith
    that, if I can retract that, I can retract other things? At the same time, this
    opportunity needed to come anyway; it has just come three years too early. These
    were hard choices, to be honest. Lidl is also there and, if you don’t make the
    deal, you know where the next address is going to be for that manufacturer.

  zh: 机会就在那里，而且现在，你必须做出决定，你现在要做什么。我是否要收回并违背我做出的承诺，冒着我过去十年的供应商会失去一些信任的风险，如果我能收回那个，我就能收回其他事情？同时，这个机会迟早会来；它只是提前了三年而已。说实话，这些都是难以选择的。利德尔也在那里，如果你不达成交易，你知道下一个地址将是那个制造商。

- en: When it was really a tough choice, there was the opportunity to talk to the
    guys in Germany and say, this is how I see things; this is what I think I should
    do; these are all the facts. Do you support this? Generally, always sticking to
    our promises was the way forward. Sometimes, if we went down a slightly different
    path, we made sure that there was some other compensation which was really fair
    and reasonable and, perhaps, a little bit unexpected on the part of the supplier.

  zh: 当真的是一个艰难的选择时，就有机会与德国的人交谈，说，这是我看到的情况；这是我认为我应该做的事情；这些都是事实。你们支持这个吗？一般来说，始终遵守我们的承诺是前进的方法。有时，如果我们走了稍微不同的道路，我们确保有一些其他的补偿是真正公平和合理的，也许对供应商来说有点出乎意料。
- en: What I’m saying is, it’s not possible to say that everything was just crystal
    clear and easy to do. Not only did we have Lidl breathing down our neck – and
    that still is the case – but there was also Netto, at the time, which was wanting
    to be a third leg of the discount scene, in the UK and all the supermarkets, despite
    what they say, were also very interested in our business model and were thinking
    about, how can we either copy some of that or do something similar ourselves?
    All those suppliers who, potentially, might have been able to fall out with us,
    could then easily have been potential suppliers for the big four who ramped up
    their own private label programs.

  zh: 我要说的是，不可能说一切都清晰明了、容易做到。我们不仅面临着**利德尔**的竞争压力 —— 而现在仍然如此 —— 而且当时还有**网托**，它想成为英国折扣市场的第三大巨头，所有的超市，尽管他们所说的是，也对我们的商业模式很感兴趣，都在思考，我们该如何复制其中一部分或者自己做类似的事情呢？所有那些潜在与我们产生纷争的供应商，很容易就成为那四大超市可能的供应商，因为他们加大了自己的自有品牌项目。
- en: We saw Tesco try to develop an Aldi MeToo type of operation but, before that,
    they were experimenting in categories with products. You don’t want to just give
    your competitors to make that easier. It was complex, to be honest, but the guiding
    principle was always, if you’ve got a contract or a handshake and you’ve said,
    I will not do this, we never compromised that.

  zh: 我们看到了**乐购**试图开发一种类似于**阿尔迪**的操作方式，但在此之前，他们在一些产品类别上进行了实验。你不希望自己的竞争对手变得更容易。说实话，这很复杂，但引导原则始终是，如果你有一个合同或者一个握手，并且你说过，我不会这样做，我们从未妥协过这一点。
