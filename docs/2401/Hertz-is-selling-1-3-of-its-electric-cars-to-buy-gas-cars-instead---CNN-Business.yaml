- en: Hertz, which has made a big push into electric vehicles in recent years, has
    decided it’stime to cut back. The company will sell off a third of its electric
    fleet, totaling roughly 20,000 vehicles, and use the money they bring to purchase
    more gasoline powered vehicles.

    because, despite costing less to maintain, they have higher damage-repair costs
    and, also, higher depreciation.

    have driven the fair market value of our EVs lower as compared to last year, such
    that a salvage creates a larger loss and, therefore, greater burden,” Scherr said.

    used car than for a new one. As the price of new car goes down, that also pushes
    down what people are willing to pay to buy a used one.

- en: Tesla makes up [about 80% of Hertz’s EV fleet](https://www.cnn.com/2021/10/25/business/hertz-tesla-purchase/index.html),
    and, altogether, EVs make up about 11% of Hertz’s total rental fleet. Tesla has
    been aggressively cutting its vehicle prices leading other automakers to do the
    same for their electric vehicles. When automakers reduce the prices of new vehicles,
    that pushes down the value of those models in the used car market, causing rapid
    depreciation.

    car market, depreciation has a big impact on their business, and is a major factor
    when deciding which cars to have in their fleets.

    at hand and trained repair technicians that other car companies have, Hertz executives
    have said, making it costly and time-consuming to get repairs.

    of a broad national parts supply network’” Hertz CEO Stephen Scherr said in a
    recent analyst call. “There’s an aftermarket of parts that is there, that is less
    mature, obviously, in the context of Tesla.”

    said, EVs are also getting in more crashes. Again, Teslas, which make up 80% of
    Hertz’s EV rental fleet, are mostly the problem in both these areas, he has said.
