- en: If you were a young person living in London in the early 1970s and you were
    looking for a bargain, the word of Nicholas Saunders was something close to holy
    scripture. Whatever you sought, Saunders had the answer. If you wanted to start
    an anarchist squat or self-publish a Trotskyist pamphlet, you consulted Nicholas
    Saunders. If you wanted to know how much a gram of cocaine should cost, or where
    to get free legal advice if you were arrested, you consulted Nicholas Saunders.
    If you just wanted to find out how to unblock a drain without calling a plumber,
    which supermarkets were cheaper for which goods, or how to fly all the way to
    India on a ticket to Frankfurt, you consulted Nicholas Saunders.

- en: A tall young man with a wild beard that gave him the look of a shaman, Saunders
    was obsessed with documenting how the new global counterculture was changing the
    ancient city around him. In 1970, at the age of 32, he self-published his findings
    in a slim but dense guidebook called Alternative London. The book was testament
    to Saunders’ belief that information should be made available to all, and that
    this information should be rigorously tested. For the section on abortions, Saunders
    had a friend phone up each provider in the city, in the process uncovering a London-wide
    scam of clinics that marketed themselves as “cheap” but in reality were charging
    over double the non-profit rate. By 1974, Alternative London and its subsequent
    revised editions had sold close to 200,000 copies and become an underground bible.

    London）的薄薄但内容密集的指南。这本书证明了桑德斯的信念，即信息应该为所有人提供，并且这些信息应该经过严格测试。对于堕胎部分，桑德斯让一个朋友打电话给城市里的每家诊所，从中揭露了一个伦敦范围内的骗局，这些诊所宣传自己是“廉价”的，但实际上收费是非营利率的两倍还多。到了1974年，《另类伦敦》及其后续修订版已经销售了近20万册，并成为一个地下圣经。

- en: Like many people who grow up around wealth, Saunders was attuned to how money
    flowed, and he loved circumventing official systems in order to find bargains
    for himself. “He didn’t want to spend any more money than he had to,” Anja Saunders,
    his partner during his final years, told me. “He was always looking to make something
    efficient.” In 1974, using £7,000 he had inherited from his recently deceased
    great aunt, he bought a former banana warehouse overlooking a triangular shard
    of courtyard in Covent Garden, which was going cheap owing to the looming redevelopment
    of its wholesale fruit and vegetable market. Two years later, Saunders started
    selling dry foods from the warehouse, enabling the type of people who had read
    Alternative London to stock up on rice, nuts and muesli for their communes. It
    was a success, and with the profits, Saunders added a bakery, a mill and a coffee
    roastery, all of which shared the same courtyard.

    1974年，他用从他最近去世的姑姑那里继承来的7000英镑买下了考文特花园一个三角形庭院的一间曾经用作香蕉仓库的房子，因为附近的水果和蔬菜市场即将重建，这房子价格便宜。两年后，桑德斯开始在这个仓库里销售干货，让那些读过《另类伦敦》的人可以为他们的公社囤积大米、坚果和麦片。这是一次成功，有了利润，桑德斯又增加了一个面包店，一个磨坊和一个咖啡烘焙坊，它们都与同一个庭院共享。
- en: 'By the autumn of 1977, the coffee house was thriving and Saunders needed new
    premises. Anita Le Roy, a customer at the warehouse, recalls Saunders coming to
    the furniture shop where she worked with a proposition: “Want to start a business?”
    At 28, she knew nothing about coffee sourcing and less about business, but she
    was exacting about taste. She agreed – on the condition that she choose the coffee.
    In 1978, Saunders found a property nearby that could fit a roaster in the basement.
    He and Le Roy filled out the interior with wooden cubicles that looked like confessional
    booths, in imitation of the old Jacobean London coffee houses. They named the
    business after the street it was on: Monmouth [Coffee](https://www.theguardian.com/food/coffee).'

    he would make it himself. In the winter of 1978, back in London after a holiday
    in Greece, he found himself craving proper Greek yoghurt: dense and creamy with
    a lactic tang and golden skin. This was a time when supermarkets mainly sold yoghurts
    with added sugar and flavouring, while unadulterated yoghurt – a pallid, joyless
    thing – was sold in health shops run by puritanical hippies. In search of his
    perfect yoghurt, Saunders scoured libraries for recipes, consulted a man called
    “Nick the Greek” who supplied all of London’s Greek restaurants, forced friends
    to bring back souring yoghurt on the plane and even went to the island of Paros
    to grill farmers. Everyone told him the same thing: it’s not possible.'

    the Greek”的人，他供应了伦敦所有希腊餐厅的食材，迫使朋友们在飞机上带回酸奶，甚至去了帕洛斯岛向农民打探。每个人都告诉他同样的事情：这是不可能的。
- en: Most people would have given up, but Saunders was not most people. “Anyone can
    do it,” he was fond of saying to sceptics. “It’s really quite simple.” The next
    year, he decided to start a dairy. He enlisted the help of a friend at the bakery,
    who, in turn, recruited Randolph Hodgson, a young man with a cherubic face and
    mop of blond hair who had just completed a food science course. Saunders, who
    was suspicious of insider knowledge, bluntly told Hodgson his degree was useless.
    Still, Saunders saw in him a pleasing willingness to try new things and he tasked
    Hodgson with the yoghurt project.

    Hodgson，一个长相天真无邪、一头金发的年轻人，他刚刚完成了一门食品科学课程。Saunders对内部知识持怀疑态度，直接告诉Hodgson他的学位毫无用处。尽管如此，Saunders看到了他一种愉快的尝试新事物的意愿，于是就把酸奶项目交给了Hodgson。
- en: 'When the dairy opened in July 1979, it did indeed sell its own yoghurt. Unfortunately,
    it tasted disgusting. It wasn’t until a few weeks later that staff realised the
    vile taste had been caused by the newly varnished incubation cupboards. After
    a few months, the dairy found its feet selling ice-cream and homemade soft cheeses.
    Eventually, even the yoghurt began to taste good. As with Monmouth Coffee, the
    new business was given a name with a nod to its location: Neal’s Yard Dairy.'

    of nothing have been almost inconceivably influential. There is strong evidence
    to suggest that the first commercially made flat white served in the UK was made
    with Monmouth beans, while if you walk into a cheese shop in the UK today, there’s
    a good chance the monger will proudly say they worked at “The Dairy”, without
    having to qualify which one. They are not only “the yardsticks by which other
    cheese shops and coffee emporiums are judged”, [according to](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2008/jan/12/foodanddrink)
    the writer Matthew Fort, but have also been responsible for the success of artisanal
    food producers across the country who have revived – in some cases, reinvented
    – British food traditions. While the 60s counterculture helped export British
    music, films and theatre to the world, today we also export our chefs, produce
    and restaurant culture. In 2021 alone, Neal’s Yard Dairy sold €1m of British cheese

  zh: 将近50年过去了，Saunders创立的乳品店和咖啡店已经产生了几乎不可思议的影响。有强有力的证据表明，英国第一家商业制作的平白咖啡使用的是Monmouth咖啡豆，而如果你今天走进英国的一家奶酪店，很有可能店员会自豪地说他们曾在“The
    Dairy”工作过，而不必特意说明是哪一家。“根据”作者马修·福特([据](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2008/jan/12/foodanddrink))的说法，他们不仅是“用来评判其他奶酪店和咖啡馆的标尺”，而且还推动了全国各地的手工食品生产商的成功，这些生产商重新振兴了（在某些情况下甚至重新发明了）英国的食品传统。虽然60年代的反文化运动帮助将英国音乐、电影和戏剧输出到世界，但今天我们也输出了我们的厨师、产品和餐厅文化。仅在2021年，Neal’s
    Yard Dairy向法国销售了100万欧元的英国奶酪。
- en: 'Yet Saunders himself remains relatively unknown. When he died in 1998, he received
    few obituaries, and since then his fame has receded further. Even now, it’s hard
    to pin down exactly who Saunders was, not least because he was so many things
    at once: a hippy, a capitalist, a pioneer, a property developer, a drugs advocate,
    a social inventor, a greengrocer, a visionary. Yet a consistent philosophy guided
    everything he did: he believed, above all, that information should be wrested
    from gatekeepers and made free for people to use. “He didn’t just make information
    available, but made you feel like anyone has the capacity to go and do it,” Hodgson
    recalls. “He lit a fire inside people.” With this philosophy, Saunders’ dairy
    and coffee house have not just been influential in their own field; together they
    have been the two transformational businesses in the modern British food culture.'

    how dire British cuisine once was. “We are notoriously the worst and most wasteful
    cooks in Europe,” a British food journal of 1870 begins. It would get much worse
    before it got any better. The twin ruptures of the Industrial Revolution and rationing
    during both world wars, which didn’t fully end until 1954, meant that knowledge
    of traditional food production ceased being handed down. At its low ebb, British
    cuisine was characterised by the hangovers of wartime austerity: sandwiches lubricated
    with mayonnaise made from water, flour and powdered egg; waterlogged cabbage;
    hotels serving French food that resembled *la grande cuisine* as much an episode
    of ’Allo ’Allo! does a Jean Renoir film. Even worse was the decline of British
    produce. Shops sold chalky, greying bread made with adulterated flour; tasteless,
    factory-produced cheese; and increasingly bland varieties of fruit and vegetables
    made homogenous for the supermarkets.'

  zh: 从21世纪的视角来看，完全理解英国的美食曾经有多糟糕是很困难的。“我们在欧洲是出了名的最差和最浪费的厨师，”一份1870年的英国食品期刊开始说。在变得更好之前，情况会变得更糟。工业革命和两次世界大战期间的配给制度，直到1954年才完全结束，意味着传统食品生产的知识停止了传承。在低谷时期，英国的美食以战时紧缩政策的余毒为特征：用水、面粉和蛋粉制成的蛋黄酱润滑的三明治；水淹没的卷心菜；酒店供应类似法国大菜的法国菜，就像《阿罗阿罗》一集与让·雷诺瓦电影一样。更糟糕的是英国农产品的衰落。商店销售掺有石灰的、变灰的面包；味道平淡的、工厂生产的奶酪；以及越来越单调的水果和蔬菜品种，为超市提供了同质化的产品。
- en: There are two well-worn narratives that explain how British food recovered.
    The first places the revolution in the 1950s with a small cadre of upper-middle
    class writers inspired by Europe and its peasant cooking, who asserted that good
    taste could be found in simple, unadorned cooking that relied on good ingredients.
    Postwar Britain under rationing was not an easy place to recreate this food. Garlic,
    so crucial to Elizabeth David’s 1950 debut Book of Mediterranean Food, was a rarity
    (the following year, it became the [first luxury ever chosen on Desert Island
    Discs](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p009ycmc)). David admitted that “the production
    of high quality foods in this country is so small … that only a negligible minority
    of people ever set eyes on [them].” The result was that peasant food became a
    desirable aesthetic for the upper-middle classes, difficult to maintain and available
    to just a few devotees.

    London, and the creation of the Modern British culinary movement in restaurants.
    In this version, a small cadre of upper-middle class chefs looked again towards
    France and the simplicity of Italian peasant cooking to transform British food.
    The techniques were European, but these chefs could call their new cuisine “Modern
    British” because the *produce* was British: sturdy Scottish and Cumbrian meat,
    native and regional cultivars of vegetables, farmhouse cheese made from cows fed

    farmhouse traditions were revived, how wholefoods and the organic movement shifted
    consumers’ diets and shopping habits, how the world-class produce being made by
    a tiny number of rural farmers found an audience in affluent city-dwellers. This

    inspiration in the mantra of the American author Timothy Leary: “Turn on, tune
    in and drop out.” It was a cultural shift that suited Saunders, who had dropped
    the “Carr” from his surname early – too posh, he decided – and whose relationship
    to authority was always antagonistic. (At Ampleforth, the Catholic public school
    he attended, he once stole ammunition and created a bomb, attempting and failing
    to blow up the chapel.) Saunders initially studied engineering, loving nothing
    more than to dismantle and reassemble things just to see how they worked, but
    he cut short his degree to live in the “alternative society” – a term he claimed
    to have coined – which was primarily made up of people like himself who could

    previous successes. “He would always look for how to exploit the system, or show
    the weaknesses in the system,” she says. But the more he did this, the more it
    catalysed a completely new obsession. What Saunders really dreamed of was creating
    the kind of communal village he could not locate for his book. When a Danish girlfriend

    came to him. He was making one of his regular trips to Freetown Christiania in
    Copenhagen, which had begun, five years earlier, as a squat in a derelict military
    barracks in Copenhagen and had grown into a large-scale experiment at building
    a society without centralised leadership, police or traditional family units.
    Christiania reminded Saunders of the energy of 60s London. It was, he felt, truly
    changing how people lived. There was a “real luxury of life there,” Saunders wrote
    in 1976\. “Fresh wholemeal rolls with butter and strong freshly ground coffee
    for breakfast is normal. All the food is best quality – the organic vegetables
    straight from farming communes. I never saw anyone drink instant coffee.”

    the photographer Mark Edwards, Saunders realised that London’s health food shops
    were charging outrageous markups for foods bought from wholesalers he was already
    using, and that he could undercut them if he sold them in large amounts. Saunders
    thought of the now-empty warehouse in central London that he had bought two years
    earlier. By the time he passed Stratford, a plan had come together. “I mean,”

    Wholefoods sold in bulk were favoured by people living in communes, who could
    stock up on essentials cheaply. But if you didn’t live in a commune, you could
    only buy wholefoods at expensive health food shops run by hippies who, in Saunders’

    Richard Branson, a former hippy who had so carefully studied the vices of capitalism
    that he had learned how to become one of its most skilful exponents. What made
    him different was his habit of giving away his most successful businesses. “Nick
    would jump in at the deep end of things, try to figure everything out about them,
    take what he could and move on,” Edwards, the photographer, told me. Hodgson recalls
    Saunders, just three months after the Dairy started, marching him over to a bank

    started to feel that the rules could be bent and sometimes broken. During the
    second year of the Dairy, Hodgson realised there was a limit on how much self-produced
    yoghurt he could sell. (It is Neal’s Yard lore that the [Monty Python cheese sketch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B3KBuQHHKx0)
    about a cheese shop that doesn’t sell cheese is based on John Cleese attempting
    and failing to order some cheese at the Dairy.) Hodgson decided to diverge from
    Saunders’ first rule and sell good quality hard cheese that wasn’t manufactured
    or prepared in the yard. This made no sense to Saunders, who was mainly interested
    in the effect that producing food could have on a person’s self-fulfilment rather
    than the actual quality. “I don’t think he was driven by how it’s going to make
    food taste better,” Hodgson says. “It was about how it grew the individual.”

- en: 'Hodgson was driven by both possibilities, and set off round the country in
    a van, seeking out his own freaks: farmers who were committed to making their
    own cheeses with traditional methods that their grandparents might recognise.
    Like Saunders and his back-to-earthers before him, the search was demoralising.
    The number of farms that made cheese themselves had declined from more than 1,000
    in 1939 to just 62 by 1974\. But Hodgson found them, and created a new market
    by connecting these producers with consumers who had an appetite for weirdness.
    One former employee at the Dairy recalls Hodgson phoning up a farmer demanding
    that he raise his prices, a move that the bargain-hunting Saunders would never
    have been able to understand, but made the strange methods of the cheesemakers
    financially viable.'

    Hodgson 找到了它们，并通过将这些生产者与对古怪食物有兴趣的消费者联系起来，创造了一个新的市场。一位 Dairy 的前员工回忆道，Hodgson 打电话给一位农民要求他提高价格，这一举措使得那位喜欢捡便宜的
    Saunders 完全无法理解，但却使奶酪制作者奇特的方法在经济上可行化。

    replacing it with cheeses from the Dairy. Trevor Gulliver, who opened the era-defining

    2000s and being struck by how out of step Monmouth was with everything else going
    on. “At that time, coffee in England was a joke globally,” Hoffmann recalls. Monmouth
    was the only place in London doing good filter coffee, even if they didn’t advertise
    it. It was also transparent about where its coffee was from, a continuation of
    Saunders’ seventh rule. “They proved a model that people will pay more for better

    space under the railway tracks at London Bridge. The area was reminiscent of Neal’s
    Yard in 1976: derelict and located near a wholesale vegetable market in steep
    decline. Hodgson needed space. In the previous 10 years, the Dairy’s rent had
    shot up, and he saw that there was enough space under the tracks for both the
    Dairy and Monmouth, plus more left over. Like Saunders 30 years earlier, Hodgson
    realised the space’s potential. The Spanish food specialist Brindisa was also
    moving in, and Hodgson calculated that if more food businesses moved in alongside
    them, they could open up their warehouses at the weekends and sell to the public
    at wholesale prices. He told the food writer Henrietta Green, author of the [Food](https://www.theguardian.com/food)

    looming over a baffled crowd of people a third of his age, who eventually adopted

    uplifting religious experience of unity that I have only felt once before, when
    I was part of a community [Christiania] that was threatened with closure,” he
    later wrote. Saunders combined all his research, including a thorough scientific

  zh: 斯帕码头仍然保留着原始尼尔斯院的一些风貌：由对工作的狂热和对外界的不信任相结合的制造商村庄。许多企业由前乳品或蒙茅斯公司的工作人员经营，如The Kernel，一个以克制的标签和缺乏广告来回想沙德斯原则的精酿啤酒厂。它是Natoora的总批发商，其影响力几乎为大多数现代英国餐厅的菜单所编写，并且它是[40
    Maltby Street](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/nov/28/40-maltby-street-restaurant-review-marina-oloughlin)的近邻，一个由霍奇森和勒罗的孩子经营的从葡萄酒进口商转变为餐厅的地方，已成为过去十年内英国开设的每家酒吧的模板。
- en: 'And yet, walking around Spa Terminus on a Saturday morning – with its £8 punnets
    of wild strawberries, and hams weighed out like precious metals – it’s hard to
    escape the feeling that Saunders would be ambivalent about the modern British
    food scene that he helped create. At times, its institutions bring to mind Saunders’s
    criticism of the shops he was once trying to put out of business: meeting places
    for the in-group, expensive, making ordinary people feel like intruders. It is
    doubtful whether many people who have lived in Bermondsey for decades can afford
    the produce being sold on their doorsteps, or see the diversity of the area reflected
    in the people who sell and shop there. Though the aim of Neal’s Yard Dairy and
    Monmouth in creating Spa Terminus is to control enough real estate to preserve
    it as the site of production they envisioned, new builds are already going up
    around the arches like saplings, while Southwark council has rebranded the entire
    viaduct as [The Low Line](https://lowline.london/), in homage to New York’s tourist
    attraction, The High Line.'

  zh: 然而，周六早晨在斯帕码头周围闲逛时 - 木莓售价8英镑，火腿被称为贵金属 - 很难摆脱这样一种感觉：沙德斯对他所帮助创造的现代英国食品场景可能持有矛盾情绪。有时，它的机构让人联想到沙德斯对他曾试图淘汰的商店的批评：小圈子的聚会场所，昂贵的，使普通人感觉像闯入者。在伯蒙西居住了数十年的许多人是否买得起他们家门口出售的产品，或者看到该地区的多样性反映在卖和购物的人群中都值得怀疑。尽管尼尔斯院乳酪店和蒙茅斯公司在打造斯帕码头的目的是控制足够的房地产，以保护他们设想中的生产场地，但新建筑已经如幼苗般拔地而起，而南华克议会已将整个高架桥重新打造为[低线](https://lowline.london/)，向纽约的旅游景点高线致敬。
- en: This is something Saunders at least would recognise. The last thing he wrote
    before his death was a proposal to Camden council arguing for the preservation
    of Neal’s Yard against gentrification. “Neal’s Yard has developed its own unusual
    character which is different to other parts of London. This unusual atmosphere
    has developed over many years through caring by people working here,” he wrote.
    “Although I have started many of the businesses and own two buildings in the yard,
    I have always been more interested in providing a socially rich environment than
    of maximising profits and property values.” His fears were well founded – the
    Neal’s Yard he helped create no longer exists.

  zh: 至少沙德斯会认出这个。在他去世前写的最后一件事是提议卡姆登议会保护尼尔斯院免受绅士化。他写道：“尼尔斯院已经发展出自己独特的氛围，与伦敦其他地方不同。这种独特的氛围多年来通过这里工作的人的关心而发展。”，“虽然我开了许多企业并拥有该院内的两栋建筑，但我一直更感兴趣的是提供一个社交丰富的环境，而不是最大化利润和房产价值。”
    他的担忧是有充分理由的 - 他帮助创造的尼尔斯院已经不复存在。

- en: The central question of Saunders’ life is what happens when you try to create
    an alternative and it becomes so successful that it is co-opted by other people
    into the dominant culture. It was a tension he was never quite able to resolve,
    except in a few small projects. It is striking, when talking to people who knew
    Saunders, that what they recall most about him is not his businesses or his books
    but his delight in these small, frivolous projects. There’s the maze of 1,500
    trees that he designed for his sister Flora; the garden he flooded at Edith Grove
    so ducks could dive bomb into his living room; the doves that he and Anja dyed
    primary colours and would make tourists visiting Neal’s Yard double-take in disbelief;
    the pneumatic chute he made as a present for Monmouth that sprayed hot coffee
    beans everywhere and had to be uninstalled. The compulsion that made him treat
    the question of yoghurt production in the same way as the chemical composition
    of an ecstasy pill found its purest expression in things that were done solely
    for the fun of it.

  zh: '通常，桑德斯一生中的核心问题是，当你试图创建一种替代方案，并且它变得非常成功以至于被其他人纳入主流文化时会发生什么。这是一种张力，他从未能够完全解决，除了一些小项目。令人注目的是，与认识桑德斯的人交谈时，他们最记得的不是他的企业或他的书籍，而是他对这些小而琐碎的项目的喜爱。有他为妹妹弗洛拉设计的1500棵树的迷宫；他在伊迪斯·格罗夫（Edith
    Grove）淹没的花园，让鸭子可以俯冲进他的客厅；他和安雅（Anja）为尼尔斯码头（Neal''s Yard）的游客涂上主要颜色的鸽子，让他们不敢相信；他送给蒙茅斯的气动滑道喷洒着热咖啡豆，不得不拆除。使他把酸奶生产的问题与伊达丸的化学成分放在同等重要的位置的冲动，在纯粹为了好玩的事情中得到了最完美的表达。  '

    from its archives about someone who had “mastered the perfect lockdown project”
    during the 1960s. It was one of those quirky silly-season stories, about a mysterious
    occurrence along the Kings Road in Chelsea. Soap bubbles had been spotted emanating
    from a building, to the bafflement of passersby. The bubbles were unusually strong;
    buffeted by the wind, they were launched high above the city to the delight of
    those who were looking. Pedestrians were stopped and asked for their theories
    about where the bubbles had come from; some guessed a secret launderette, others
    a factory. “It’s jolly pretty,” one woman says. “It just makes your day.” “What
    if I told you,” the presenter asks each one, “that there is a man behind there
    who’s blowing those bubbles?”
