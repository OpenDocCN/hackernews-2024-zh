    looking for a bargain, the word of Nicholas Saunders was something close to holy
    scripture. Whatever you sought, Saunders had the answer. If you wanted to start
    an anarchist squat or self-publish a Trotskyist pamphlet, you consulted Nicholas
    Saunders. If you wanted to know how much a gram of cocaine should cost, or where
    to get free legal advice if you were arrested, you consulted Nicholas Saunders.
    If you just wanted to find out how to unblock a drain without calling a plumber,
    which supermarkets were cheaper for which goods, or how to fly all the way to
    India on a ticket to Frankfurt, you consulted Nicholas Saunders.

- en: A tall young man with a wild beard that gave him the look of a shaman, Saunders
    was obsessed with documenting how the new global counterculture was changing the
    ancient city around him. In 1970, at the age of 32, he self-published his findings
    in a slim but dense guidebook called Alternative London. The book was testament
    to Saunders’ belief that information should be made available to all, and that
    this information should be rigorously tested. For the section on abortions, Saunders
    had a friend phone up each provider in the city, in the process uncovering a London-wide
    scam of clinics that marketed themselves as “cheap” but in reality were charging
    over double the non-profit rate. By 1974, Alternative London and its subsequent
    revised editions had sold close to 200,000 copies and become an underground bible.

    flowed, and he loved circumventing official systems in order to find bargains
    for himself. “He didn’t want to spend any more money than he had to,” Anja Saunders,
    his partner during his final years, told me. “He was always looking to make something
    efficient.” In 1974, using £7,000 he had inherited from his recently deceased
    great aunt, he bought a former banana warehouse overlooking a triangular shard
    of courtyard in Covent Garden, which was going cheap owing to the looming redevelopment
    of its wholesale fruit and vegetable market. Two years later, Saunders started
    selling dry foods from the warehouse, enabling the type of people who had read
    Alternative London to stock up on rice, nuts and muesli for their communes. It
    was a success, and with the profits, Saunders added a bakery, a mill and a coffee
    roastery, all of which shared the same courtyard.

    premises. Anita Le Roy, a customer at the warehouse, recalls Saunders coming to
    the furniture shop where she worked with a proposition: “Want to start a business?”
    At 28, she knew nothing about coffee sourcing and less about business, but she
    was exacting about taste. She agreed – on the condition that she choose the coffee.
    In 1978, Saunders found a property nearby that could fit a roaster in the basement.
    He and Le Roy filled out the interior with wooden cubicles that looked like confessional
    booths, in imitation of the old Jacobean London coffee houses. They named the
    business after the street it was on: Monmouth [Coffee](https://www.theguardian.com/food/coffee).'

    he would make it himself. In the winter of 1978, back in London after a holiday
    in Greece, he found himself craving proper Greek yoghurt: dense and creamy with
    a lactic tang and golden skin. This was a time when supermarkets mainly sold yoghurts
    with added sugar and flavouring, while unadulterated yoghurt – a pallid, joyless
    thing – was sold in health shops run by puritanical hippies. In search of his
    perfect yoghurt, Saunders scoured libraries for recipes, consulted a man called
    “Nick the Greek” who supplied all of London’s Greek restaurants, forced friends
    to bring back souring yoghurt on the plane and even went to the island of Paros
    to grill farmers. Everyone told him the same thing: it’s not possible.'

    year, he decided to start a dairy. He enlisted the help of a friend at the bakery,
    who, in turn, recruited Randolph Hodgson, a young man with a cherubic face and
    mop of blond hair who had just completed a food science course. Saunders, who
    was suspicious of insider knowledge, bluntly told Hodgson his degree was useless.
    Still, Saunders saw in him a pleasing willingness to try new things and he tasked
    Hodgson with the yoghurt project.

    a few months, the dairy found its feet selling ice-cream and homemade soft cheeses.
    Eventually, even the yoghurt began to taste good. As with Monmouth Coffee, the
    new business was given a name with a nod to its location: Neal’s Yard Dairy.'

    with Monmouth beans, while if you walk into a cheese shop in the UK today, there’s
    a good chance the monger will proudly say they worked at “The Dairy”, without
    having to qualify which one. They are not only “the yardsticks by which other
    cheese shops and coffee emporiums are judged”, [according to](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2008/jan/12/foodanddrink)
    the writer Matthew Fort, but have also been responsible for the success of artisanal
    food producers across the country who have revived – in some cases, reinvented
    – British food traditions. While the 60s counterculture helped export British
    music, films and theatre to the world, today we also export our chefs, produce
    and restaurant culture. In 2021 alone, Neal’s Yard Dairy sold €1m of British cheese
    to France.

    few obituaries, and since then his fame has receded further. Even now, it’s hard
    to pin down exactly who Saunders was, not least because he was so many things
    at once: a hippy, a capitalist, a pioneer, a property developer, a drugs advocate,
    a social inventor, a greengrocer, a visionary. Yet a consistent philosophy guided
    everything he did: he believed, above all, that information should be wrested
    from gatekeepers and made free for people to use. “He didn’t just make information
    available, but made you feel like anyone has the capacity to go and do it,” Hodgson
    recalls. “He lit a fire inside people.” With this philosophy, Saunders’ dairy
    and coffee house have not just been influential in their own field; together they
    have been the two transformational businesses in the modern British food culture.'

    how dire British cuisine once was. “We are notoriously the worst and most wasteful
    cooks in Europe,” a British food journal of 1870 begins. It would get much worse
    before it got any better. The twin ruptures of the Industrial Revolution and rationing
    during both world wars, which didn’t fully end until 1954, meant that knowledge
    of traditional food production ceased being handed down. At its low ebb, British
    cuisine was characterised by the hangovers of wartime austerity: sandwiches lubricated
    with mayonnaise made from water, flour and powdered egg; waterlogged cabbage;
    hotels serving French food that resembled *la grande cuisine* as much an episode
    of ’Allo ’Allo! does a Jean Renoir film. Even worse was the decline of British
    produce. Shops sold chalky, greying bread made with adulterated flour; tasteless,
    factory-produced cheese; and increasingly bland varieties of fruit and vegetables
    made homogenous for the supermarkets.'

    The first places the revolution in the 1950s with a small cadre of upper-middle
    class writers inspired by Europe and its peasant cooking, who asserted that good
    taste could be found in simple, unadorned cooking that relied on good ingredients.
    Postwar Britain under rationing was not an easy place to recreate this food. Garlic,
    so crucial to Elizabeth David’s 1950 debut Book of Mediterranean Food, was a rarity
    (the following year, it became the [first luxury ever chosen on Desert Island
    Discs](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p009ycmc)). David admitted that “the production
    of high quality foods in this country is so small … that only a negligible minority
    of people ever set eyes on [them].” The result was that peasant food became a
    desirable aesthetic for the upper-middle classes, difficult to maintain and available
    to just a few devotees.

    London, and the creation of the Modern British culinary movement in restaurants.
    In this version, a small cadre of upper-middle class chefs looked again towards
    France and the simplicity of Italian peasant cooking to transform British food.
    The techniques were European, but these chefs could call their new cuisine “Modern
    British” because the *produce* was British: sturdy Scottish and Cumbrian meat,
    native and regional cultivars of vegetables, farmhouse cheese made from cows fed
    on English pastures. (Today, when an ambitious restaurant opens in Britain, it
    will usually list the British food producers that supply it.)'

    materials such as Formica that modernised cafes and espresso bars; the creation

    farmhouse traditions were revived, how wholefoods and the organic movement shifted
    consumers’ diets and shopping habits, how the world-class produce being made by
    a tiny number of rural farmers found an audience in affluent city-dwellers. This

    16th-century mansion, Water Eaton Manor, on the outskirts of Oxford. As a child,
    if Nicholas had a question that his father, Sir Alexander Carr-Saunders, the director
    of the London School of Economics, could not immediately answer, Alexander would
    retreat to his study. A few days later, he would present the young Nicholas with
    a thorough answer. The idea that the information you need could always be made
    available was a lesson that never left Saunders.

    up a generation of hippies who had abandoned the pursuit of success and found
    inspiration in the mantra of the American author Timothy Leary: “Turn on, tune
    in and drop out.” It was a cultural shift that suited Saunders, who had dropped
    the “Carr” from his surname early – too posh, he decided – and whose relationship
    to authority was always antagonistic. (At Ampleforth, the Catholic public school
    he attended, he once stole ammunition and created a bomb, attempting and failing
    to blow up the chapel.) Saunders initially studied engineering, loving nothing
    more than to dismantle and reassemble things just to see how they worked, but
    he cut short his degree to live in the “alternative society” – a term he claimed
    to have coined – which was primarily made up of people like himself who could
    afford to drop out. In 1969, he took up residence at 65 Edith Grove – near Chelsea’s
    World’s End Estate, the centre of London’s counterculture – where he engineered
    an egg-shaped papier-mache cave at its centre. Passersby could always spot the
    house thanks to a contraption that blew bubbles out on to the street.'

    called Nicholas Albery who worked for BIT, an underground information service
    that had been partly funded by a £1,000 donation from Paul McCartney. It was London’s
    answer to free information initiatives like Stewart Brand’s San Francisco-based
    Whole Earth Catalog – a publication Steve Jobs famously called “[Google in paperback

    a competition called The Alternative Ideas Pool to encourage people to think up
    ways to improve the world. One contributor proposed breaking up the UK into 40
    republics; another, not content with just one bad idea, suggested both a university
    built on a cruise ship and a “Love House” where people “could learn how to fuck”.

    real world experiments. Saunders was fascinated by the back-to-earthers, who had

    on a new book, [Alternative England and Wales](https://ediblewomansdigest.wordpress.com/2018/01/24/alternative-england-and-wales-1975-the-psychedelic-guide-to-uk-counterculture/%0D),

    celebration of individuality was creating a new orthodoxy, with Saunders as its
    spokesperson. His friend Judith Morgan, who accompanied Saunders on his farm visits,
    recalls how impatient Saunders was to move on to the next thing, rather than repeat
    previous successes. “He would always look for how to exploit the system, or show
    the weaknesses in the system,” she says. But the more he did this, the more it
    catalysed a completely new obsession. What Saunders really dreamed of was creating
    the kind of communal village he could not locate for his book. When a Danish girlfriend
    meditating with a candle inadvertently burned down his highly flammable cave,
    Saunders was ecstatic. “I told her that the whole flat represented the life I
    wanted to leave behind,” Saunders later [wrote](https://nealsyardlondon.co.uk/history/).

    came to him. He was making one of his regular trips to Freetown Christiania in
    Copenhagen, which had begun, five years earlier, as a squat in a derelict military
    barracks in Copenhagen and had grown into a large-scale experiment at building
    a society without centralised leadership, police or traditional family units.
    Christiania reminded Saunders of the energy of 60s London. It was, he felt, truly
    changing how people lived. There was a “real luxury of life there,” Saunders wrote
    in 1976\. “Fresh wholemeal rolls with butter and strong freshly ground coffee
    for breakfast is normal. All the food is best quality – the organic vegetables
    straight from farming communes. I never saw anyone drink instant coffee.”

    nuts, which were expensive in Denmark owing to a luxury tax, and sell them to
    Christiania’s general store. On that day in 1976, in a minivan with his friend,
    the photographer Mark Edwards, Saunders realised that London’s health food shops
    were charging outrageous markups for foods bought from wholesalers he was already
    using, and that he could undercut them if he sold them in large amounts. Saunders
    thought of the now-empty warehouse in central London that he had bought two years
    earlier. By the time he passed Stratford, a plan had come together. “I mean,”
    Edwards recalls Saunders spluttering, “I could set it up in Neal’s Yard!”

    defined in Alternative London as food “farmed without the usual intensive techniques,
    free of additives and [with] the minimum of processing”. (In other words, organic-*ish*.)
    Wholefoods sold in bulk were favoured by people living in communes, who could
    stock up on essentials cheaply. But if you didn’t live in a commune, you could
    only buy wholefoods at expensive health food shops run by hippies who, in Saunders’
    words, “would make customers feel bad because they could not recognise a mung
    bean”. Saunders hated these shops, which he saw as inefficient, expensive and
    exclusionary. If wholefoods were going to reach as many people as possible, he
    needed to offer something different.

    his wholefood warehouse in Neal’s Yard. It was decked out in the cheapest, utilitarian
    way possible, “Christiania style” as Saunders put it, using recycled materials
    from demolition sites. It sold staples in bulk: nuts, tahini, honey, oils, peanut
    butter and, most famously, muesli. A bakery and a flour mill, using a grinder
    imported from Christiania, soon followed.'

    and beautiful people with feathers in their hair” emerging from what she had previously
    considered a dank, rat-infested courtyard. They were the wholefood warehouse workers,

    the packing floor by throwing themselves off the building on a rope to act as
    a counterweight. For a time, the yard was soundtracked by the squiggly hiss of

    as Saunders, or were ex-Christianites. Some resented the increase in “straight”
    customers that the Yard’s success was attracting. In 1977, when a Daily Telegraph
    article flooded the Yard with people from the home counties desperate for bargain
    basement coffee, Saunders temporarily shut it down. He may have distrusted the
    “freaks”, but Saunders also realised that if too many “straights” came then the
    Yard’s alternative atmosphere could not be maintained. Days later, an irritated
    customer came by to harangue Saunders with his thoughts on the matter: “So you

    Saunders, just three months after the Dairy started, marching him over to a bank

    started to feel that the rules could be bent and sometimes broken. During the
    second year of the Dairy, Hodgson realised there was a limit on how much self-produced
    yoghurt he could sell. (It is Neal’s Yard lore that the [Monty Python cheese sketch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B3KBuQHHKx0)
    about a cheese shop that doesn’t sell cheese is based on John Cleese attempting
    and failing to order some cheese at the Dairy.) Hodgson decided to diverge from
    Saunders’ first rule and sell good quality hard cheese that wasn’t manufactured
    or prepared in the yard. This made no sense to Saunders, who was mainly interested
    in the effect that producing food could have on a person’s self-fulfilment rather
    than the actual quality. “I don’t think he was driven by how it’s going to make
    food taste better,” Hodgson says. “It was about how it grew the individual.”

    a van, seeking out his own freaks: farmers who were committed to making their
    own cheeses with traditional methods that their grandparents might recognise.
    Like Saunders and his back-to-earthers before him, the search was demoralising.
    The number of farms that made cheese themselves had declined from more than 1,000
    in 1939 to just 62 by 1974\. But Hodgson found them, and created a new market
    by connecting these producers with consumers who had an appetite for weirdness.
    One former employee at the Dairy recalls Hodgson phoning up a farmer demanding
    that he raise his prices, a move that the bargain-hunting Saunders would never
    have been able to understand, but made the strange methods of the cheesemakers
    financially viable.'

    The best British restaurants could prove they cared enough about native produce
    by removing the French cheese course that had traditionally punctuated meals and
    replacing it with cheeses from the Dairy. Trevor Gulliver, who opened the era-defining
    restaurant St John with Fergus Henderson in 1994, told me that “there was no one
    else”, when it came to deciding their cheese supplier, a relationship that has
    continued for 30 years.

    for coffee. [James Hoffmann](https://www.jameshoffmann.co.uk/), one of the architects
    of Britain’s third-wave coffee movement, remembers coming to London in the early
    2000s and being struck by how out of step Monmouth was with everything else going
    on. “At that time, coffee in England was a joke globally,” Hoffmann recalls. Monmouth
    was the only place in London doing good filter coffee, even if they didn’t advertise
    it. It was also transparent about where its coffee was from, a continuation of
    Saunders’ seventh rule. “They proved a model that people will pay more for better
    coffee that tastes of somewhere,” Hoffmann says, pointing to the coffee wholesalers
    and shops who built their businesses on the success of Monmouth.

    they achieved when working together. One day in 1994, Hodgson was on his way to
    visit the Dairy’s new yoghurt production site in Kent when he noticed an unusual
    space under the railway tracks at London Bridge. The area was reminiscent of Neal’s
    Yard in 1976: derelict and located near a wholesale vegetable market in steep
    decline. Hodgson needed space. In the previous 10 years, the Dairy’s rent had
    shot up, and he saw that there was enough space under the tracks for both the
    Dairy and Monmouth, plus more left over. Like Saunders 30 years earlier, Hodgson
    realised the space’s potential. The Spanish food specialist Brindisa was also
    moving in, and Hodgson calculated that if more food businesses moved in alongside
    them, they could open up their warehouses at the weekends and sell to the public
    at wholesale prices. He told the food writer Henrietta Green, author of the [Food](https://www.theguardian.com/food)

    of the place, he told her: “Borough.” (She answered: “Where?”)'

    even fashionable, to eat well. The columns of Nigel Slater and the TV shows of
    Jamie Oliver broadcast to the world that the best produce in the UK, maybe even
    Europe, could be found at Borough. The market was telling the country a story
    about itself that it wanted to hear, of a Britain that was reviving its cultural
    history. Malcolm Veigas, an assistant director with Bolton Council, once gave
    an interview to the BBC’s Food Programme in which he cited Borough as the lightbulb
    moment for councils that wanted to harness the new interest in food to rejuvenate

    ideas. In 1988, Saunders opened the world’s first “computer launderette” – a proto-cyber
    cafe – and launched a desktop publishing house where you could use computers to
    publish your own work. It was not a success. Most of the other quixotic schemes
    that he had around this time were never realised, except one, a restaurant called

    events. First, he fell in love with a woman named Anja Dashwood, with whom he
    collaborated and lived, in the flat above Neal’s Yard, for the rest of his life.
    The second was his discovery of MDMA. Finding that it relieved his depression,
    Saunders began researching the drug in his typically obsessive way. His commitment
    to understanding MDMA would find him turning up to drum’n’bass raves, nervously
    looming over a baffled crowd of people a third of his age, who eventually adopted
    him as their own. “I experienced a feeling of belonging to the group, a kind of
    uplifting religious experience of unity that I have only felt once before, when
    I was part of a community [Christiania] that was threatened with closure,” he
    later wrote. Saunders combined all his research, including a thorough scientific
    analysis of every single street pill he came across, into a book published in
    1993 called E For Ecstasy. Saunders’ website [ecstasy.org](http://ecstasy.org/)
    would become as canonical to the 90s counterculture as Alternative London had
    been for the 70s; his acolytes called him the new Timothy Leary.

    has developed over many years through caring by people working here,” he wrote.
