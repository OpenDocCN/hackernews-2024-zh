- en: X has served some of its users unlabeled advertisements since September of last
    year. These ads appear in a users' feed without any "ad" or "promoted" label that
    the platform usually affixes to paid posts. However, users can tell that these
    are unlabeled ads and not organic posts because they are missing the date the
    post was published, which are shown on posts but not ads. In addition, as Mashable
    previously reported and as the quoted X user also [discovered](https://twitter.com/SHL0MS/status/1748337607694574045
    "(opens in a new window)"), users can still find an option to tell X that they
    are "not interested in this ad" in the dropdown ellipsis icon menu on unlabeled
    ads. This option does not appear for organic posts.

  zh: 从去年 9 月起，X 为一些用户提供了未标记的广告服务。这些广告出现在用户的动态中，没有平台通常附加到付费帖子上的 "广告" 或 "推广" 标签。然而，用户可以通过这些帖子缺少发布日期来判断这些帖子是未标记的广告而不是有机帖子，因为帖子会显示发布日期，而广告不会。此外，正如
    Mashable 之前报道的，以及引述的 X 用户也[发现的](https://twitter.com/SHL0MS/status/1748337607694574045
    "(在新窗口中打开)")，用户仍然可以在未标记广告的下拉菜单中找到一个选项，告诉 X 他们对这个广告 "不感兴趣"。这个选项对有机帖子不可见。

    "(opens in a new window)") newsletter in a recent [report](https://twitter.com/broderick/status/1748384877496406257
    "(opens in a new window)") that because there's a labeled pre-roll video ad that
    plays before MrBeast's video, the company considers that to be the disclosure.
    This, according to the X employee, explains why there's no "ad" or "promoted"
    label affixed to the actual Mr Beast post itself.

  zh: 一位 X 员工在最近的[报告](https://twitter.com/broderick/status/1748384877496406257 "(在新窗口中打开)")中告诉《Garbage
    Day》的 Ryan Broderick，因为在 MrBeast 的视频之前有一个标记的预告片广告，所以公司认为那就是披露。据该 X 员工称，这就解释了为什么实际的
    MrBeast 帖子本身没有附加 "广告" 或 "推广" 标签。
- en: That doesn't make any sense. The pre-roll video ad is a completely different
    advertisement. If viewers are being served MrBeast's post in their feed and it
    isn't organically showing up — and the aforementioned attributes point to it being
    served via X's advertising platform — then MrBeast's post containing the video
    is a completely separate advertisement, and needs to be labeled as such.
  id: totrans-15

  zh: 这毫无意义。预先播放的视频广告是完全不同的广告。如果观众在他们的动态中看到了 MrBeast 的帖子，而这并不是自然出现的——并且上述属性表明它是通过
    X 的广告平台提供的——那么 MrBeast 的帖子中包含的视频就是一个完全不同的广告，需要作出相应的标识。
- en: In fact, as some other X users have [pointed out](https://twitter.com/drmistercody/status/1748398929321029865
    "(opens in a new window)"), older versions of the X app indeed show MrBeast's
    post with the "promoted" label which means it is being served to users via X's

  zh: 实际上，正如其他一些 X 用户[指出的](https://twitter.com/drmistercody/status/1748398929321029865
    "(在新窗口中打开)")，X 应用的旧版本确实显示了 MrBeast 的帖子，并带有“推广”标签，这意味着它是通过 X 的广告平台向用户提供的。
- en: We should note here that it's possible that some users are being served MrBeast's
    post organically. Many ads on X are published as regular posts and then later
    boosted through its ad platform. The instances mentioned in this piece, however,
    are promoted posts being served through X's ad platform.

  zh: 我们应该在这里指出，有可能某些用户是通过自然方式看到了 MrBeast 的帖子。X 上的许多广告是作为常规帖子发布的，然后通过其广告平台进行推广。但是，本文提到的情况是通过
    X 的广告平台提供的推广帖子。
- en: So, it appears that X is juicing MrBeast's impressions via unlabeled ads. One
    can certainly argue whether this lack of transparency is intentional or not, but
    this does seem to be what's happening.

    就是如此。
- en: MrBeast, whose real name is Jimmy Donaldson, previously voiced opposition to
    uploading to X. According to MrBeast, his videos cost too much to produce, and
    YouTube was the only platform that could compensate him fairly for the amount

    directly to X at least once as a "test."

    Mr Beast's post has 128 million views.) However, on X, views aren't counted like
    they are on video platforms like YouTube. On the contrary, those "views" are actually
    just impressions on the post itself, not the number of people who played MrBeast's
    video. In May 2023, Musk had X [remove the public video view](https://mashable.com/article/twitter-removes-video-view-count-metrics)

    creator monetization program works. X users can only participate in the monetization
    program if they are paying subscribers to X's monthly subscription programs like

- en: As Mashable has previously [reported](https://mashable.com/article/twitter-ad-share-revenue-creators-elon-musk-favorites-eligibility),
    X's payout amounts to each creator seems completely arbitrary. X employees have
    shared that users can't really calculate how much they'll actually make as pay
    isn't determined by a set number of views like they are on other platforms. Those
