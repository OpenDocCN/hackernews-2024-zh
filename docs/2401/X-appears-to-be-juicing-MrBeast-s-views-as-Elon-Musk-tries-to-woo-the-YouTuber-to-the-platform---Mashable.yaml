- en: MrBeast, the most popular creator on YouTube, uploaded his latest YouTube video
    to Elon Musk's X for the first time. According to MrBeast, he was "curious" about
    "how much ad revenue" he would make from the upload, so he uploaded the video
    directly to the platform as a "test."

    being forced into their feed multiple times a day as an unlabeled advertisement.

    recent phenomenon on X that began after Musk acquired the company in October 2022\.

    year. These ads appear in a users' feed without any "ad" or "promoted" label that
    the platform usually affixes to paid posts. However, users can tell that these
    are unlabeled ads and not organic posts because they are missing the date the
    post was published, which are shown on posts but not ads. In addition, as Mashable
    previously reported and as the quoted X user also [discovered](https://twitter.com/SHL0MS/status/1748337607694574045
    "(opens in a new window)"), users can still find an option to tell X that they
    are "not interested in this ad" in the dropdown ellipsis icon menu on unlabeled
    ads. This option does not appear for organic posts.

    labeling issue.

    "(opens in a new window)") newsletter in a recent [report](https://twitter.com/broderick/status/1748384877496406257
    "(opens in a new window)") that because there's a labeled pre-roll video ad that
    plays before MrBeast's video, the company considers that to be the disclosure.
    This, according to the X employee, explains why there's no "ad" or "promoted"
    label affixed to the actual Mr Beast post itself.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That doesn't make any sense. The pre-roll video ad is a completely different
    advertisement. If viewers are being served MrBeast's post in their feed and it
    isn't organically showing up — and the aforementioned attributes point to it being
    served via X's advertising platform — then MrBeast's post containing the video
    is a completely separate advertisement, and needs to be labeled as such.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In fact, as some other X users have [pointed out](https://twitter.com/drmistercody/status/1748398929321029865
    "(opens in a new window)"), older versions of the X app indeed show MrBeast's
    post with the "promoted" label which means it is being served to users via X's
    advertising platform.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We should note here that it's possible that some users are being served MrBeast's
    post organically. Many ads on X are published as regular posts and then later
    boosted through its ad platform. The instances mentioned in this piece, however,
    are promoted posts being served through X's ad platform.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So, it appears that X is juicing MrBeast's impressions via unlabeled ads. One
    can certainly argue whether this lack of transparency is intentional or not, but
    this does seem to be what's happening.

    on video content. X CEO Linda Yaccarino's big announcement at this year's CES,
    for example, was that the company signed former CNN host Don Lemon, sports radio
    host Jim Rome, and Fox News contributor Tulsi Gabbard to exclusive video deals.

    replies and urge them to upload their content directly to X. In fact, he did this
    [very thing](https://mashable.com/article/mrbeast-x-video-upload-experiment) to
    MrBeast on a few occasions.

- en: MrBeast, whose real name is Jimmy Donaldson, previously voiced opposition to
    uploading to X. According to MrBeast, his videos cost too much to produce, and
    YouTube was the only platform that could compensate him fairly for the amount
    of views his content receives. But MrBeast was apparently convinced to try uploading
    directly to X at least once as a "test."

    upload performs, then the X owner just secured the most popular content creator
    on the internet for his multimedia vision for the future of X.

    "(opens in a new window)") that his post had over 100 million views. (As of publication,
    Mr Beast's post has 128 million views.) However, on X, views aren't counted like
    they are on video platforms like YouTube. On the contrary, those "views" are actually
    just impressions on the post itself, not the number of people who played MrBeast's
    video. In May 2023, Musk had X [remove the public video view](https://mashable.com/article/twitter-removes-video-view-count-metrics)

    on X.

- en: It's almost impossible to tell how much MrBeast will rake in due to how X's
    creator monetization program works. X users can only participate in the monetization
    program if they are paying subscribers to X's monthly subscription programs like
    X Premium or X Premium+. In addition, X only pays creators for ads that appear
    in the replies to their posts. Furthermore, only impressions from other paying
    X Premium subscribers count towards monetization.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As Mashable has previously [reported](https://mashable.com/article/twitter-ad-share-revenue-creators-elon-musk-favorites-eligibility),
    X's payout amounts to each creator seems completely arbitrary. X employees have
    shared that users can't really calculate how much they'll actually make as pay
    isn't determined by a set number of views like they are on other platforms. Those
    who have made the most on X appear to mostly consist of Musk's personal favorite
    political commentators, Tesla fans, and meme accounts.

    from this test. So, we'll soon find out the answer to that question. Whatever
    MrBeast makes though, it seems clear that X put its fingers heavily on the scale
    to make sure circumstances favored a massive view count.
