    a replication of an influential 1993 [study](http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/0033-295X.100.3.363)

    — those who were considered elite — were the ones who had practiced the most.
    The conclusions implied that deliberate practice was the most important ingredient
    needed to achieve elite status, more important than inborn characteristics like
    genetics, or personality.'

    by journalist Malcolm Gladwell. He dubbed it the “10,000-hour rule.” “Ten thousand
    hours is the magic number of greatness,” Gladwell wrote, drawing on anecdotes
    from famous success-havers (like Bill Gates and the Beatles), but also on the
    1993 paper (which according to Google Scholar has been cited more than 9,800 times).

    Reserve University — included a somewhat larger sample size and tighter study
    controls, and was preregistered (meaning that the scientists locked their methods
    and analysis plans in place before they collected any data, preventing them from
    retroactively changing their premise to fit their findings).

    the original article claimed, and surprisingly, it works differently for elite

    alone than the average amount of the good violinists,” the authors write. Practice
    still mattered: It accounted for 26 percent of the difference between good violinists
    and the less accomplished students. But the original study claimed that practice
    accounted for 48 percent of the difference.'

    stretch to extrapolate findings from a study on violin students to other areas.)
    Studies have been chipping away at the “10,000-hour rule” for years. (See Slate
    for a write-up of some of [these studies](https://slate.com/technology/2014/09/malcolm-gladwells-10000-hour-rule-for-deliberate-practice-is-wrong-genes-for-music-iq-drawing-ability-and-other-skills.html).)

    co-authored by Macnamara — in *Perspectives in Psychological Science* looked at
    33 studies on the relationship between deliberate practice and athletic achievement
    and found that practice just doesn’t matter that much. More precisely, the analysis
    found, practice can account for 18 percent of the difference in athletic success.
    Put another way, if we compare batting averages between two baseball players,
    the amount of time the players spent in the batting cage would only account for
    18 percent of the reason one player’s average is better than the other.

    genetics, personality, life history, etc. — makes up the majority of the difference.
    “Almost across the board, practice should improve one’s performance,” Macnamara
    told [me in 2016](/2016/5/30/11767704/practice-doesnt-make-perfect).

    reflecting on how I was a poor athlete growing up. I’d spend hours practicing
    lacrosse but never get any better at it, frustrating myself, parents, and coaches.
    Could I have practiced even more? Yes. But would have I really caught up to the
    best players? I doubt it. How much frustration would I have saved by just realizing
    I wasn’t all that coordinated when it came to sports, and that was okay?

    should, be great at anything we put our minds to. And it can blind us to the joy
    that can be found in mediocrity. The 10,000-hour rule is compelling in a world
    that clings to the idea that people rise up through society based on merit. And
    that’s a myth worth debunking too.
