- en: '**January 10, 2024 –** DJI, the world’s leader in civil drones and creative
    camera technology, today introduces DJI FlyCart 30 (FC30) to the global market.
    This delivery drone overcomes traditional transport challenges with its large
    payload capacity, long operation range, high reliability, and intelligent features.
    Now delivery, such as mountain transportation, offshore transportation, or emergency
    rescue transportation, can be performed with more efficiency and flexibility.'

    drones have transformed industries by improving safety for workers and productivity
    for businesses,” said   Christina Zhang, Senior Director of Corporate Strategy
    at DJI. “We are optimistic that FlyCart 30 will become a trusted solution for
    aerial delivery, solving complex terrain and terminal transportation problems
    efficiently, economically, and most importantly, safely from the air.”

- en: FC30 adopts a coaxial four-axis, eight-blade, multi-rotor configuration with
    carbon fiber propellers and can achieve a 20 m/s maximum flight speed. When in
    its dual-battery configuration, it can carry a 30 kg payload 16 km. In its emergency
    single-battery configuration, the payload capacity increases to 40 kg for a distance
    of 8 km. DJI O3 transmission maintains a stable connection between the drone and
    remote controllers up to 20 km away. Dual Operator mode allows control to be transferred
    between two pilots in different locations with a single click.

    FC30 has IP55 protection, can operate in temperatures ranging from -20° to 45°
    C (-4° to 122° F), and can fly in winds up to 12 m/s. The standard propellers
    are optimized for altitudes from 0-6,000 m and support flight up to 3,000 m with
    a 30 kg payload. Self-heating batteries maintain optimal performance even in low
    temperatures.

    throughout operation. Before takeoff, it evaluates flight route viability based
    on environmental conditions, and ensures pre-takeoff safety through audio-visual
    prompts and by delaying propeller launch. During flight, the dual active phased
    array radar and binocular vision systems enable all-weather multidirectional intelligent
    obstacle sensing, day or night. The built-in ADS-B signal receiver gives timely
    warning of nearby crewed aircraft. In emergencies, an integrated parachute can
    deploy at low attitudes and land the drone stably, protecting both people and
    property.

    convenient landing sites. The winch system includes a 20m cable that can manually
    or automatically retract at 0.8 m/s and can carry 40 kg. AR Projection assists
    accurate placement of goods by indicating the projected landing point. During
    flight, FC30 can intelligently adjust its flight attitude, automatically reducing
    cargo swing.
