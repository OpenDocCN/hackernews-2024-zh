# How True Name helps transgender people make a name for themselves | Mastercard Newsroom

“When you’re just trying to buy something,” he says, “you don’t expect to have to explain your entire gender identity or life choices or where you’re at in your transition to total strangers.”

Nearly half of transgender or nonbinary people in Canada feel anxiety, embarrassment and frustration when [showing an ID that doesn’t reflect their identity](https://www.mastercard.com/news/press/2022/march/bmo-is-first-canadian-financial-institution-to-launch-true-name-by-mastercard/), according to a January  Mastercard survey.

A quarter of those surveyed say they have not changed their gender marker on their formal ID, discouraged by the expensive and time-consuming process — it often requires both a name change, then obtaining certification of the transition from a health care professional. There’s also the matter of having to explain the situation to potentially hostile strangers and fielding intrusive questions about their surgical status.

[New research by Mastercard](https://www.mastercard.com/news/insights/2022/true-name/) across 16 countries in North America and Europe revealed that 59% of people who identity as nonbinary say they feel unsafe while shopping, and 57% say they think it’s important that companies and organizations address them in a way that respects their identity.

Members of the transgender and nonbinary community in Canada now have a tool to help to ease uncomfortable or potentially unsafe encounters at checkout  and further incorporate their chosen name into their daily life. Mastercard’s [True Name](https://www.mastercard.com/news/perspectives/2020/truth-in-plastic-what-it-means-to-go-shopping-with-no-explanation-necessary/) feature lets cardholders with participating banks use their true first name on their card without requiring a legal name change. 

DiGiuseppe looks forward to receiving a new card with his chosen name and no longer having to pay cash or ask friends or family members to shop for him to avoid stressful in-store questions or confrontations.

“For me, there was always a workaround,” he says, “but there shouldn’t have to be. Trans people have enough to worry about. Not worrying about your name on your credit or your debit card really helps to even the scales.”
