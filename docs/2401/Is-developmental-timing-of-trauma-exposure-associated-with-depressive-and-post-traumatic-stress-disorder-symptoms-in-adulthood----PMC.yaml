- en: Exposure to traumatic life events, including child maltreatment or natural disasters,
    is increasingly recognized as one of the major social determinants of psychiatric
    disorders. Trauma exposure has been shown to about double the risk for major depressive
    disorder ^([1](#R1)–[4](#R4)), which is currently estimated to affect 11.7% of
    adolescents ^([5](#R5)) and 16.6% of adults ^([6](#R6)). Trauma exposure (or more
    precisely, exposure to events involving perceived or threatened loss of life,
    serious injury, or loss of physical integrity), is also a requirement to meet
    DSM-IV criteria for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)^([7](#R7)), which has
    a lifetime prevalence of 4.7% among adolescents ^([8](#R8)) and 7.8% among adults
    ^([9](#R9)). As trauma exposure is common in the population, with six out of every
    10 children ^([8](#R8)) and one out of two adults in the United States reporting
    a lifetime trauma exposure ^([9](#R9)), greater insight into the role of trauma
    exposure on both depression and PTSD etiology is needed.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One understudied facet of trauma exposure that may be linked to future psychopathology
    risk is the developmental period of trauma occurrence. Researchers studying child
    abuse and neglect, in particular, sometimes consider developmental timing as an
    important dimension of defining maltreatment, finding that age at onset to maltreatment
    may influence the etiology of mental health problems ^([10](#R10),[11](#R11)).
    However, few attempts have been made in the broader trauma literature to examine
    ways in which age at onset to trauma exposure is associated with risk for psychopathology.
    As a result, we currently lack knowledge about the existence of “sensitive periods”
    ^([12](#R12)–[14](#R14)) for psychopathology risk, meaning windows of time in
    the course of development when trauma exposure may confer a particularly elevated
    risk for the onset of depression or PTSD. Determining whether, and when, sensitive
    periods exist across the lifespan will be important for understanding developmentally-relevant
    biological pathways implicated in the etiology of psychopathology and guiding
    the investment of limited public health resources to the “high-risk” stages when
    deleterious exposures are most harmful and the “high-reward” stages when enriching
    exposures and interventions could offer their greatest benefit.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Thus far, only a small number of studies have examined possible sensitive periods
    corresponding to risk for either depression or PTSD. Among these studies, no consensus
    has emerged regarding whether earlier or later exposure is predictive of elevated
    risk for either outcome. With respect to depression, three prospective studies
    observed that individuals with maltreatment prior to age 5 had higher levels of
    teacher-reported internalizing symptoms in early childhood ^([15](#R15)) and self-reported
    depressive symptoms in early ^([16](#R16)) and early to mid-adulthood ^([17](#R17))
    compared to those who were either never exposed or exposed during later stages.
    Retrospective studies have also found earlier abuse (before age 5 ^([18](#R18)),
    before age 12 ^([19](#R19),[20](#R20),[21](#R21)), or before age 17 ^([22](#R22)))
    or trauma (between 4–6 ^([23](#R23)) and before age 12 ^([19](#R19),[20](#R20)))
    particularly elevates risk for depressive symptoms and major depressive disorder.
    In two of these studies ^([19](#R19),[20](#R20)), early exposure to interpersonal
    trauma, such as witnessing trauma, physical attacks, and sexual molestation, conferred
    the largest harm relative to other traumas. However, prospective studies have
    also found exposure to maltreatment during adolescence (between 10–12 ^([24](#R24))
    or 12–17 ^([25](#R25))) was more strongly associated with adolescent depressive
    symptoms than earlier maltreatment. A recent retrospective study also found emotional
    abuse specifically at age 14 was most predictive of depression during young adulthood
    ^([26](#R26)). Three prospective studies ^([11](#R11),[27](#R27),[28](#R28)) and
    two retrospective studies ^([29](#R29),[30](#R30)) found no effect of developmental
    timing of maltreatment in relation to internalizing symptoms and adolescent or
    adult depression.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For PTSD symptoms or PTSD diagnoses, similarly mixed findings have been observed.
    For instance with respect to child abuse, retrospective studies have found that
    children with PTSD tended to report a lower age at first exposure (between 3–5
    ^([31](#R31))), and that sexual assault or physical abuse before age 11, but not
    childhood neglect, conferred the highest risk for PTSD ^([32](#R32)). Retrospective
    studies have also found older children (ages 13–18 ^([21](#R21))) had higher risk
    for PTSD relative to their peers exposed at other ages. One prospective study
    of childhood sexual abuse found no association between age at abuse onset and
    PTSD symptoms ^([33](#R33)). Evidence regarding the effects of age at onset to
    natural disasters appears more consistent, with both retrospective ^([34](#R34))
    and prospective studies ^([35](#R35),[36](#R36)) observing higher levels of PTSD
    symptoms or PTSD diagnoses among older children (around age 7 and above) compared
    to younger children (those younger than about age 7). However, results for other
    traumas is less conclusive, with retrospective studies suggesting there are no
    differences ^([37](#R37),[38](#R38)) in risk for PTSD based on age at onset of
    trauma, that early-life trauma is more harmful ^([39](#R39),[40](#R40)), or that
    middle childhood (ages 6–11) is more strongly associated with PTSD ^([41](#R41)).

- en: Although these studies suggest the developmental timing of trauma exposure may
    be associated with subsequent risk for depression or PTSD, these studies are limited
    by a focus on a small subset of adversities, reliance on small clinical or convenience
    samples, and failure to account for the correlated nature of adversities ^([2](#R2)).
    Moreover, relatively few have examined, the time-dependent effects of specific
    trauma types. Instead, most prior studies have focused generally on “early life
    adversity,” meaning adversities occurring over a broad span of ages (typically
    birth to age 14). In addition, even fewer studies have accounted for the frequency
    of exposure to adversity, leaving open the possibility earlier trauma exposure
    may be confounded by the number of times exposed.

    developmentally-sensitive measures of trauma exposure were associated with depressive
    and PTSD symptoms in a sample of highly-trauma exposed adults. We conducted these
    analyses using a low income, urban-sample of African American adults with both
    high rates of trauma exposure (>90% exposed to at least one traumatic event) and
    high rates of depressive and PTSD symptoms ^([42](#R42)), which provided an opportunity
    to examine the differential effects of age at onset to trauma that would not be
    possible in samples where the prevalence of trauma was lower. More specifically,
    we examined the effect of timing of first exposure to trauma, coded as: *early
    childhood* (age 0–5 years), *middle childhood* (6–10 years), *adolescence* (11–18
    years), and *adulthood* (19+ years), on self-reported depressive and PTSD symptoms
    in adulthood. Traumatic event types were separated into child maltreatment, other
    interpersonal trauma, non-interpersonal trauma, and other events in order to determine
    if sensitive periods of trauma exposure differed based on the type of trauma exposure.'

    at Grady Hospital in Atlanta, Georgia. The clinics are part of a publically funded,
    non-profit healthcare center serving a primarily African American, urban population
    from low socioeconomic backgrounds. The benefits of this particular sample include
    identification of an understudied population, a group with a high rate of trauma,
    and a relatively homogeneous socioeconomic status distribution. Participants were
    recruited from clinic waiting areas. Eligible participants were at least 18 years
    old, not actively psychotic, and able to give formal written and verbal consent.
    Consenting individuals participated in verbal interviews administered by trained
    research assistants lasting approximately 45–75 minutes, depending on participant’s
    trauma history and symptoms. Participants received $15 for participation. Emory
    University’s Institutional Review Board and the Grady Health Care System Research

    whose data were collected between 2005 and 2013 (74.6% female; mean age=41.0,
    SD=13.8). These adults had complete data on all measures relevant to the current
    analyses. We restricted analyses to African Americans, as significant differences
    were observed in the distribution of trauma exposure, covariates, and both outcomes;
    restriction to one racial/ethnic group eliminated the variability associated with
    race, allowing us to more effectively control for confounding. Adjustment or stratification
    by race was not possible as individuals from other racial/ethnic groups comprised
    only 7.7% of the sample (3.6% were White and 4.1% identified as other), resulting
    in low power to detect associations due to small cell counts. Of note, our analytic
    sample is smaller than the larger study sample due to the fact that participants
    complete study questionnaires in clinic waiting rooms until the clinic is ready
    to see them/their family member, thus the majority of participants do not complete
    all measures.

    trauma but can reflect symptoms related to any of the traumas reported on the

    or more times a week) as experienced by the individual in the past two weeks from

    and bivariate analyses to compare outcome values by each covariate. We also examined
    the distribution of exposure to each traumatic event in the total sample and by
    age at first exposure among those who were exposed. To determine whether respondents
    exposed at earlier ages also had more frequent trauma exposure, we examined the
    percent of respondents exposed to frequent trauma by reported age at first exposure.
    Following these analyses, we fit a series of linear regression models that examined,
    separately for each traumatic event and type, the association between trauma exposure
    and each outcome, after adjusting for covariates. Model 1 examined the effect
    of being exposed (vs. non-exposed) at any age to trauma. Model 2 (partial adjustment)
    examined the effect of timing of exposure (compared to the referent group of non-exposed
    during any period), after adjusting for covariates as well as exposure to all
    other traumatic events, given that some exposures, particularly child maltreatment
    events, were highly correlated (tetrachoric correlation values ranged from r=0.07
    to r=0.63). Model 3 (full adjustment) expanded upon Model 2 by additionally including
    the indicator for frequency of each trauma event occurrence (0=low frequency;
    1=high reported number of occurrences of that trauma exposure). For Models 2 and
    3, we conducted a test of homogeneity to evaluate whether the beta coefficients
    (indicating the effect of timing of exposure relative to never exposed) were significantly
    different from each other. In cases where the null hypothesis was rejected for
    the test for homogeneity (p<0.05), indicating that the effects of developmental
    timing differed across groups, we then conducted post-hoc Tukey tests to evaluate,
    after adjustment for multiple testing, which specific age at exposure groups differed
    from one another. All analyses were conducted using SAS Version 9.4 (SAS Institute,

    and other interpersonal violence, but not non-interpersonal violence or any other
    trauma (). Specifically, participants first exposed to child maltreatment during
    early childhood (β=0.739) had depressive symptoms scores that were about 1.5 times
    as high as those first exposed during middle childhood (β=0.519) and almost twice
    as high as those first exposed during adolescence (β=0.397), even after adjusting
    for sociodemographic covariates and exposure to other trauma types (Tukey p-value
    <0.05 for both comparisons). In other words, the predicted depressive symptom
    score for those first exposed during early childhood would be 0.470 (SD = 0.27),
    whereas the predicted depressive symptom score for those first exposed during
    middle childhood would be 0.245 (SD = 0.27). These differences persisted after
    additionally adjusting for frequency of trauma exposure (Model 3 results) and
    appeared driven primarily by exposure to sexual abuse ([Supplemental Table 1](#SD1)).

    in increasing levels of PTSD symptoms (), no significant differences were found

- en: This study examined the association between developmental timing of exposure
    to trauma and levels of depression and PTSD symptoms within a sample of highly-trauma
    exposed adults. By studying a racially and socioeconomically homogeneous sample,
    where trauma exposure was common, we were able to examine the effects of age at
    first exposure to trauma. Such analyses may not have been possible in a heterogeneous
    sample where trauma exposure was more rare.

- en: In line with previous research ^([1](#R1)–[4](#R4)), we found that those who
    were trauma exposed (regardless of age at first exposure) had significantly higher
    levels of depressive and PTSD symptoms relative to those who were unexposed to
    trauma. These findings add further support to the well-documented finding that
    trauma exposure elevates risk for psychopathology across the lifecourse.
  prefs: []

- en: However, a more novel observation from this study was that there appeared to
    be two developmental stages when trauma exposure was associated with elevated
    levels of subsequent psychopathology. First, participants exposed to child maltreatment
    during early childhood (ages 0–5) had both depression and PTSD symptoms that were
    up to twice as high as those exposed during later developmental stages. These
    effects were detected even after controlling for sociodemographic characteristics,
    exposure to other types of traumas, and the number of occurrences of child maltreatment
    (i.e., the frequency of exposure). Such findings are consistent with several prospective
    ^([15](#R15)–[17](#R17)) and retrospective studies ^([18](#R18),[31](#R31)) also
    showing an elevated risk for subsequent depression, in particular, among those
    first exposed in the first five years of life. Although the mechanisms linking
    early trauma exposure to subsequent psychopathology risk are not well known ^([56](#R56)),
    early trauma exposure may be more damaging than later trauma exposure because
    it compromises a child’s ability to successfully master stage-salient developmental
    tasks (e.g., self-regulation, secure attachments) ^([57](#R57)) and damages the
    foundation of brain architecture and neurobiological systems involved in regulating
    arousal, emotion, stress responses, and reward processing ^([58](#R58)–[61](#R61)),
    which are all implicated in the onset and persistence of stress-related disorders
    like depression and PTSD.

    (ages 6–10) to other types of interpersonal violence, including witnessing a friend
    or family member being murdered or being attacked with or without a weapon, had
    depressive symptoms scores that were about twice as high as those first exposed
    during adulthood. Similar results were also detected for PTSD, but were not statistically
    significant after adjusting the frequency or number of occurrences of child exposure.
    These results are consistent with at least some prior studies suggesting that
    trauma during middle childhood, including severe illness ^([41](#R41)), or natural
    disasters ^([34](#R34)–[36](#R36)) is associated with an elevated risk for PTSD
    relative to exposure in other periods. Although the mechanisms driving this association
    are unclear, exposure to interpersonal violence events during middle childhood
    may be more harmful than exposure in adulthood for a number of reasons: school-age
    children may be in a unique developmental stages where they do not benefit as
    much from parental buffering ^([62](#R62)), when demands from the social environment
    increase (i.e., relating to peers, participating in school activities) ^([63](#R63)),
    and when adaptive coping capacities are still developing ^([64](#R64)).'

    have been missed had we not considered the effect of timing of trauma exposure.
    Our findings therefore underscore that a basic comparison of those “exposed” to
    those who are “unexposed” may potentially mask important within-group differences
    that are only revealed when examining developmental timing of exposure to trauma.
    These findings also emphasize the need to adjust, where possible, for frequency
    of exposure to trauma, as some developmental timing differences may be attenuated
    after considering this information.

- en: Several limitations of the current study must be noted. First, the measure of
    trauma exposure included in this study did not capture other characteristics of
    the trauma, including its severity, chronicity, or duration. Our frequency indicator
    variable may have captured some of these domains, though this remains unclear,
    as the frequency measure was not specific to a given year. In the case of abuse,
    the relationship of the perpetrator to the victim was also not examined and could
    have impacted the specific results for abuse types. Indeed, there is evidence
    suggesting more negative psychological outcomes among those experiencing abuse
    perpetrated by a family member rather than non-family member ^([65](#R65),[66](#R66)).
    Moving forward, larger scales studies are needed to examine the extent to which
    chronicity, duration, and perpetrator of the trauma varies as a function of developmental
    timing. Second, trauma exposure and age at first exposure to trauma were assessed
    retrospectively in adulthood. Retrospective reports of child maltreatment in particular
    have been shown in some cases to be less reliable and valid than prospective reports,
    because of memory inaccuracies, a reluctance to disclose personal matters, or
    current mood states ^([67](#R67)). However, recent studies have found retrospective
    and prospective measures produce similar estimates of effect for mental disorders
    ^([68](#R68)), suggesting that trauma exposure is harmful regardless of ascertainment
    strategy and that even if recall bias is present, effect estimates are unlikely
    altered. Some studies have documented differential recall bias across the lifespan,
    showing increasing problems in recall and disclosure of early trauma events as
    age increases (see for example ^([69](#R69))) as well as an association between
    earlier age at onset of child abuse with greater amnesia in adult memory recovery
    of those events ^([70](#R70)). However, accurate recall of memories as early as
    age 2–3 years old has been documented ^([70](#R70),[71](#R71)), older individuals
    show no autobiographical memory recall difference for memories from any point
    in their lives^([72](#R72)), and underreporting is more likely than falsely positively
    reporting early abuse^([73](#R73)). Moreover, by using developmental periods,
    rather than specific ages, we were able to maintain consistency with prior studies
    and reduce recall bias as compared to reports focused on single ages. Participants
    unsure of their age at first trauma exposure were also excluded. Prospective research
    is needed to replicate these findings; this work would ideally incorporate repeated
    measures of trauma exposure and mental health in order to differentiate short-
    versus long-term effects of trauma timing on psychopathology. Finally, our sample
    was largely comprised of participants who were low income, female, and African
    Americans. Our analyses were also restricted to African Americans, due to the
    small number of respondents in other racial/ethnic groups. However, as noted above,
    a number of the findings from this study are consistent with those found in studies
    using samples with different demographic profiles. Further, this study focuses
    on a largely under-studied population with high levels of mental health problems;
    studying this unique population is key to help determine that factors that might
    impact the development of psychiatric conditions and the developmental stages
    when interventions or supports may be most beneficial.

- en: In conclusion, our study underscores the need to consider the developmental
    period of trauma exposure, as the effect of some traumas varied as a function
    of when in the course of development the trauma occurred. Identification of these
    developmental stages of heightened vulnerability will aid in determining sensitive
    periods and guiding the investment of limited public health dollars towards the
    life stages when age-tailored interventions can be delivered and deliver their
    greatest returns.
