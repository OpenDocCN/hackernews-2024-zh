Technitium Mesh is a secure, anonymous, peer-to-peer (p2p), open source instant messenger designed to provide end-to-end encryption. It can be used for messaging over the Internet as well as private LAN networks not connected to the Internet.

The software relies on strong cryptography using DHE-2048, ECDHE-256, RSA-2048 and AES-256 algorithms for encryption and authentication. The instant messenger is a successor to [Bit Chat](https://github.com/TechnitiumSoftware/BitChatClient) and is currently available only for Windows.
