    into a [venture I started](https://www.jumpcomedy.com/) providing event and ticket
    management services for comics. It’s been relatively successful with tens of thousands
    of tickets sold, and happy customers who are referring other customers. This post
    is a collection of some of the learnings from this time. They are by no means
    exhaustive but just something that’s on my mind this lazy Sunday morning. This
    is me breaking the writing cobwebs after a year in hibernation. Bear with me.

- en: Instead of spending time planning and concocting roadmaps, replace that activity
    by talking to current or potential customers on how their lives can be improved,
    and letting that determine your next feature. Injecting the actual customer who
    uses the software into the development process is key to creating value. The more
    proxies you have between the developer and the customer, the less the product
    will meet customer needs.

    the higher the unvalidated assumptions, and the lower the chance that it creates
    any customer value. I have made too many mistakes assuming that something is valuable,
    when nobody cares about it. A large backlog should be looked at with an extremely
    high degree of skepticism, as *the size of your backlog is inversely proportional
    to how often you talk to customers*.

    build. The what should come directly from the customer, with the software development
    process needing a direct physical line to customer - no proxies.

    infested with assumptions. Get a basic UI out the door which uses your current
    understanding of how a customer might use the app. By [following the basics](https://www.uxtoast.com/design-tips/gestalt-principles-in-ui),
    it’ll be 60% right and that’s all you need. You can hone the rest through customer
    feedback. If you think you can’t design UIs, you can. We all use consumer apps
    and are much more in tune with what a UI should look like than we were 20 years
    ago.

- en: Implementing that feedback depends on how well-designed your UI code is, and
    focusing on good component design instead of wireframe/visual designs is time
    well spent. A product’s capacity to implement UI customer feedback is more important
    than a product’s initial UI, yet we tend to focus far too much on the latter with
    heavy design up front. Small components and low-level reusability are key in UIs
    that are easy to change.

    [PostHog](https://posthog.com/)’s session replay feature and am amazed watching
    videos of how customers use the product compared to how I think they use it. You
    can track all the metrics you want, but there’s something surreal about seeing
    a user scroll up and down trying to find something, hitting the back button, waiting,
    trying to click something that isn’t clickable etc. These qualitative measures
    can complement the quantitative measures that most people track.

- en: There will be a case where you will wonder what a specific customer is seeing
    in production. There is no point even trying to recreate this in your test environment;
    instead invest heavily in account spoofing, i.e., the ability for an admin user
    to use the app as if they were a specific production user. This makes testing
    easy, allows you to diagnose issues effectively and reduces the need on test data,
    which always has a degree of unreliability in it.

  zh: 会有这样一个情况，您会想知道特定客户在生产环境中看到了什么。在测试环境中甚至都没有重现这一点的意义；相反，要大量投资于账户欺骗，即管理员用户能够像特定的生产用户一样使用该应用程序的能力。这样做会使测试变得简单，使您能够有效地诊断问题，并减少对测试数据的需求，而测试数据总是具有一定的不可靠性。

- en: The first thing a customer seems when they come to your app should have the
    most relevant information for that customer, and be sparse in content. The tendency
    to jam too many things on page one increases cognitive load and can waste a potentially
    great jumping off point. Running various types of experiments on what the engagement
    numbers here are is well worth the time. *If the user is reaching for the menu
    on page one, there’s something wrong with your UI.*

    I’ve found it a good metric to indicate whether customers feel strongly enough

    ad dollars at some point, but that’s not where we should start. Getting each of
    your customers happy enough to recommend your product to other customers is a
    perfectly solid marketing strategy. This also gives us a higher chance of creating

    being able to create sticky customers, so focusing on keeping a smaller set of
    customers happy enough to recommend your product, over casting the net for a larger
    base of customers is turning out to be a sound strategic decision. It’s also given
    us better focus as instead of catering and prioritizing a wide array of customer
    requests, we’ve focused on making sure a smaller set of customers love our product.
