    toward the moon. If it lands successfully, Peregrine will become the first private
    lander ever to reach the lunar surface. The mission will also mark the debut of
    ULA's new [Vulcan Centaur rocket](https://www.space.com/vulcan-centaur-rocket).

    NASA that will pave the way for future lunar exploration as part of the agency's
    [Artemis program](https://www.space.com/artemis-program.html). But also tucked
    away on the mission's manifest are sets of human DNA and remains, which are going
    up on memorial spaceflights offered by two different companies, [Celestis](https://www.space.com/celestis-enterprise-us-presidents-dna-deep-space)
    and [Elysium Space](https://www.space.com/23433-elysium-space-burial-human-ashes.html).
    Celestis will send one of its memorial payloads off into the final frontier of
    deep space on its Enterprise mission, while its Tranquility payload will ride
    to the moon on the Peregrine lander. Elysium Space will also place its own payload
    on [the moon](https://www.space.com/55-earths-moon-formation-composition-and-orbit.html)
    with Peregrine.

    objection](https://www.space.com/moon-navajo-nation-objection-human-remains-ula-vulcan-centaur-celestis-elysium-space)
    with NASA and the U.S. Department of Transportation over what he calls an act
    of desecration. "It is crucial to emphasize that the moon holds a sacred position
    in many Indigenous cultures, including ours," Nygren wrote in a letter dated Dec.
    21\. "The act of depositing human remains and other materials, which could be
    perceived as discards in any other location, on the moon is tantamount to desecration
    of this sacred space." Nygren has asked NASA to delay the mission until the Navajo
    Nation's objections are addressed.

- en: In a pre-launch science briefing on Thursday (Jan. 4), NASA representatives
    addressed the controversy over the payloads containing human remains being included
    on the mission, noting that the mission is a private, commercial effort and that
    NASA has merely contracted for its scientific payloads to be transported to the
    moon. "We don't have the framework for telling them what they can and can't fly,"
    said Chris Culbert, Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS) program manager at
    NASA's [Johnson Space Center](https://www.space.com/17216-nasa-johnson-space-center.html)
    in Houston. "The approval process doesn't run through NASA for commercial missions."

    CLPS program "don't have to clear those payloads" before launch. "So these are
    truly commercial missions, and it's up to them to sell what they sell," Culbert
    said.

    that some non-NASA commercial payloads can be a cause for concern to some communities,"
    Kearns said. "And those communities may not understand that these missions are
    commercial and they''re not U.S. government missions, like the ones that we''re
    talking about."'

    agencies to learn more about how to regulate access to the moon going forward.
    "We're going to learn through these first landings, and the follow-up landings,
    all the different issues or concerns that are generated by that. And I'm sure
    that, as time goes by, there are going to be changes to how we view this, or how
    industry itself maybe sets up standards or guidelines about how they're going
    to proceed."
