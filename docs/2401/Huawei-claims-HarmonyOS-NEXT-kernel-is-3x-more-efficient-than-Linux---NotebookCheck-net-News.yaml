    Huawei's Consumer Business Group CEO, describes, "It's a real operating system
    and not an Android skin." The CEO further clarified that the OS doesn't run on
    [Linux](The-Finals-update-sours-Steam-Deck-users-excitement-with-game-crashes-broken-voice-chat-on-SteamOS-and-Linux.794171.0.html)

    which Huawei claims is three times more memory efficient than Linux cores. The
    company says the OS uses a 'heterogenous native-like" mechanism, making the operating
    system capable of delivering a fluid experience.
