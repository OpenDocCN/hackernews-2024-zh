- en: This last weekend I was sitting in a hotel room in Memphis, staring out at the
    parking lot turned ice skating rink, wanting to just have a couple of hours with
    my brain turned off. I opened Netflix hoping to find a movie that would give me
    an evening’s respite. Scrolling down to the top 10, I was met with a who’s who
    of the 2010s and 2020s. *Cowboy & Aliens*, the 2011 flop with a great cast, was
    on the list. *Queenpins*, the 2021 flop with a great cast, was also there. At
    the top of the list was *The Legend of Tarzan*, a 2016 flop with a great cast.
    Rounding out the top 10 was a Sylvester Stallone flick from 2019 and a handful
    of new releases I’d heard nothing about until I saw them in the top 10 list.

    for your limited dollars, it feels like a not great thing that Netflix’s top 10
    list could be mistaken for the lineup at TNT. But it also feels like that might
    be Netflix’s plan. Just today, it announced it was going to be the new official
    home of one of basic cable’s crown jewels: [WWE *Monday Night Raw*](/2024/1/23/24047785/netflix-monday-night-raw-exclusive-live-streaming-leaving-cable).
    And yesterday, the company [announced the departure of Scott Stuber](/2024/1/22/24047398/one-of-the-primary-architects-of-netflixs-golden-age-is-leaving),
    who oversaw Netflix film’s three consecutive years as the most nominated film
    studio at the Academy Awards.'

    sharp reversal of the [streaming golden age](/2022/12/14/23507793/streaming-wars-hbo-max-netflix-ads-residuals-warrior-nun)
    replaced by something akin to Spike TV circa 2005\. Or USA Network circa 2011\.
    That isn’t necessarily a bad thing. Both networks were good at putting entertaining
    old films and TV shows in front of me and capturing programming successes with
    WWE, US dubs of popular and outrageous game shows from overseas, and *Suits.*

- en: The problem is those are just also kind of Netflix’s streaming strategy in 2024
    when the economics of streaming are still in flux and, thus far, pretty different
    from cable. (Although *Suits* has had such a popular run at Netflix that [USA
    is now pivoting back to making that kind of content, too](https://deadline.com/2023/12/usa-network-blue-sky-scripted-series-1235656853/)).
    Netflix’s rapidly growing ad business will likely cover the cost of WWE rights.
    “This should add some fuel to our new and growing ad business,” Netflix co-CEO
    Ted Sarandos [said in an earnings call after the announcement](https://go.redirectingat.com/?xs=1&id=1025X1701640&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3Dv5EjcFtq_bc).
    But, if it doesn’t, then spending $5 billion to secure the rights for [WWE *Monday
    Night Raw* for the next ten years](https://www.businessinsider.com/why-netflix-pro-wrestling-wwe-deal-makes-sense-2024-1)
    means Netflix subscribers could see another price hike in their future — whether
    they like wrestling or not.

    a while now. It’s got a programming problem. In its bid to be the best streamer,
    it didn’t focus on specific audiences as most other streamers did. Instead, Netflix
    has tried to reach every audience. First with originals, and now by just buying
    up the streaming rights to things. So it''s got whatever this long-delayed and
    troubled [adaptation of *Avatar: The Last Airbender*](/24047888/avatar-the-last-airbender-trailer-netflix)

    successes from other companies out there and hoping no one notices that Netflix
    isn’t doing a lot of really good originals of its own. During that earnings call,
    Sarandos noted that licensed content was a better deal when running an advertising
    business — before quickly noting that the [service’s most-watched shows](/24003126/netflix-viewing-data-ginny-georgia-witcher)
    continued to primarily be originals (a few K-dramas like the excellent *Crash
    Course in Romance* also cracked the top 20).

- en: When you’re as big as Netflix, leaning on much cheaper licensed content isn’t
    a bad strategy. You make money spending less on it than your originals, the place
    you’re buying from gets to have it on their service, too, and everyone looks nice
    and friendly and competitive in case [the FTC comes around](/2023/12/22/24011064/warner-bros-discovery-paramount-merger-very-bad).

    If there’s a choice between spending that on Netflix’s giant grab bag of stuff
    and Apple TV’s pretty pristine library of well-made science fiction shows... a
    science fiction nerd might go with Apple TV as it’s just $9.99\. Or they might
    go with Amazon, because they get Thursday Night Football and Prime TV is included
    with Amazon Prime; or Disney because they have children and it starts at $7.99
    with ads, but costs just $13.99 for no ads; or Paramount Plus because they have
    lingering fantasies of being a cowboy and want to spend only $11.99.'

- en: Eventually, this strategy of Netflix’s — to rely on its size, content bought
    from other streamers, and a graveyard of prematurely canceled originals — could
    struggle. If it continues to be the priciest platform with fewer exclusives, people
    may just move elsewhere. But maybe Roman Reigns (and the new WWE deal) can prop
    up the whole enterprise on his exceptional shoulders. It worked for plenty of
    basic cable channels until streaming came along.
