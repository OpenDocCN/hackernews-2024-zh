- en: The top U.S. cyber watchdog agency issued an [emergency directive](https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/directives/ed-24-01-mitigate-ivanti-connect-secure-and-ivanti-policy-secure-vulnerabilities)
    Friday, mandating that all federal agencies protect themselves against a dangerous
    vulnerability in a popular software program. The watchdog said it is conducting
    investigations into whether China had used the program to spy on the agencies.

    employees to remotely connect to work. A devastating vulnerability in the program,
    first discovered in December by the cybersecurity company Volexity, can grant
    hackers significant access to the businesses or government agencies that use it
    and allows for the creation of additional back doors to return later.

    assistant director at the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency
    (CISA), said that hackers have learned about the vulnerability and increasingly
    have tried to hack companies and government agencies that use Connect Secure.

    by CISA and the relevant agency,” Goldstein said.

    said, though it wasn’t yet clear if any had been successful. Around 15 agencies
    use the software, he said.

    when CISA announced that a vulnerability in an [earlier version](https://www.ivanti.com/company/press-releases/2020/ivanti-acquires-mobileiron-and-pulse-secure)
    of the same program, at the time called Pulse Secure, had enabled hackers to gain
    access to multiple federal U.S. agencies. The cybersecurity company Mandiant,
    now owned by Google, said at the time that the hackers who had gained access to
    federal systems were members of a Chinese intelligence service conducting espionage.

    Chinese government’s position on cyber security is consistent and clear. We have
    always firmly opposed and cracked down on all forms of cyber hacking in accordance
    with the law. The remarks by the U.S. side is completely distorting the truth."

    these vulnerabilities to exploit federal agencies. But of course, we are focused
    on that very issue and driving urgent mitigation to ensure that both our federal
    networks and critical infrastructure are taking the right steps in response,”
    he said.
