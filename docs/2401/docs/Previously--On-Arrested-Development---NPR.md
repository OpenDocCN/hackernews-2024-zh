Arrested Development [is back](http://movies.netflix.com/WiMovie/Arrested_Development/70140358?trkid=8133737)! Because ~~we're obsessed~~ we care about your watching enjoyment, we wrote down all the recurring gags in every episode — including the new season 4 episodes — with special attention to jokes hidden in the background ([like Cloudmir vodka](joke-83.html)) or being foreshadowed ([like when Buster lost his hand](joke-122.html)).

Click the jokes for disconcerting detail.

New jokes! We've updated with dozens of season 4 gags.
