**Boeing says there will be more quality inspections for its 737 Max aircraft after an unused door blew off an Alaska Airlines plane mid-flight.**

The US plane maker said that an outside party would be brought in to assess its production practices.

It will also check the work of the firm that supplies and installs the parts involved in the accident.

Last week, the US regulator extended the grounding of 737 Max's with similar fuselage panels.

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) also said it would conduct an audit of the plane's production line, adding it believed there were "significant problems" with the 737 Max 9 jet as well as "other manufacturing problems".

Announcing the latest measures, Boeing commercial airplanes president and CEO Stan Deal said the company was "not where we need to be".

Following the grounding of the planes, Mr Deal said Boeing had been working with the five airlines affected to "bolster quality assurance and controls" in 737 production.
