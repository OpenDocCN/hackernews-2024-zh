# Dev Board Micro | Coral

> 来源：[https://coral.ai/products/dev-board-micro](https://coral.ai/products/dev-board-micro)

## Description

* * *

The Coral Dev Board Micro is a microcontroller board with a built-in camera, microphone, and Coral Edge TPU, allowing you to quickly prototype and deploy low-power embedded systems with on-device ML inferencing.

By combining the Cortex M4 and M7 processors with the Coral Edge TPU on this board, you can design systems that gracefully cascade from extreme low-power ML inferencing to more complex—yet still power-efficient—ML inferencing.
