# OpenAI: Copy, steal, paste – Computerworld

We’ve been down this road before. In the 1990s, newspapers and magazines began a long decline because they couldn’t master making a profit from publishing on the internet. That’s why Google, which was able to transform our content into profits via advertising, made billions and billions while news publications continue to circle the drain. 

I can’t see the publishers making that blunder again. This time, we’ll get paid. And if Microsoft and OpenAI don’t make quite as many billions as they’d hoped for, I won’t cry for them.

Of course, we might fail. If that happens, well, we can actually see what that future looks like. Cory Doctorow, blogger and science fiction writer, coined the pungent word, “Enshittification” for it. By this, he means the fall off in the quality of online sites and information.
