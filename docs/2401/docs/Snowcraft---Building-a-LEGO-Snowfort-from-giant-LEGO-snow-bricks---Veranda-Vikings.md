# Snowcraft - Building a LEGO Snowfort from giant LEGO snow-bricks — Veranda Vikings

As the winter world outside our window dresses itself in a cloak of snow, varying from the lightest flakes to the most tenacious of drifts, we embrace the playful side of this frosty season. On days when the snow is just right, when it holds together like the perfect snowball, we step outside, not for a snowman or a snow cave, but for something a little more... constructive.

With giant LEGO-shaped [storage bin](https://www.lego.com/categories/storage) lids in hand, we've found a way to bring a touch of the beloved digital world of Minecraft into our very real backyard. The concept is simple: we press the lid into the snow, compacting it firmly to create a block of winter wonder. Then, with a gentle lift, we reveal a perfect 2x2 LEGO brick made entirely of snow. It’s a matter of getting the angle just right, pressing consistently, and soon enough, we have a pile of snowy bricks ready for assembly.
