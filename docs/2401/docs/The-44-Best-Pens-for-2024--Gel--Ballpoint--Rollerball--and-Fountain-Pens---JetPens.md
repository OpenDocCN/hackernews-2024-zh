is a fantastic rollerball pen for left-handed writers. The

tip size dried within four seconds on Rhodia paper, which tends to make inks dry slower. The

tip size dried within two seconds!

The Multi Ball isn’t just a great pen for paper, though. It’ll write on nonporous surfaces too, including glass, ceramic, plastic, and almost anything else. The fine tip size is perfect for signing the backs of credit cards without smearing.

You may think that there must be a tradeoff to achieve this [multi-surface](https://www.jetpens.com/blog/The-Best-Pens-that-Write-on-Any-Surface/pt/743) marvel, but Pilot didn’t make any sacrifices on the writing quality. It’s delightfully smooth on paper and produces a deep, dark line every time.
