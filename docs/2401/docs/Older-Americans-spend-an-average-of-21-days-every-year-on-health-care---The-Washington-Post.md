Older adults spend an average of three weeks every year on doctor’s appointments and other health care outside their homes, [according to research published in the Annals of Internal Medicine](https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/M23-2331).

Of those 21 “health care contact days,” 17 involve ambulatory services, such as office visits with primary-care doctors or specialists, testing and imaging, procedures, treatments and therapy. The remaining four days included time spent in an emergency room, hospital, skilled nursing facility or hospice.
