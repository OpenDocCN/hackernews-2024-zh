Buying cryptocurrencies is just like buying Beanie Babies, a Coinbase lawyer told a judge on Wednesday.

Coinbase [is facing a lawsuit from the Securities and Exchange Commission](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/currencies/sec-sues-coinbase-violating-securities-regulation-binance-crypto-regulation-gensler-2023-6?utm_medium=ingest&utm_source=markets) accusing it of selling unregistered securities, but Coinbase made the case that the crypto tokens on its platform are more like collectibles than stocks and bonds.

Coinbase lawyer William Savitt said that when a cryptocurrency is bought, the buyer doesn't gain any rights like they do when they buy stocks or bonds.

"It's the difference between buying Beanie Babies Inc. and buying Beanie Babies," Savitt argued.

In addition to the crypto sector, the court case could have wide-ranging implications for the collectibles market depending on how US District Judge Katherine Polk Failla rules on the case. 

"I am presented with the specter of collectibles being regulated by the SEC," [Failla said.](https://twitter.com/jchervinsky/status/1747702463124193347)

[Beanie Babies were the subject of a late 1990s boom and bust](https://www.businessinsider.com/rise-and-fall-beanie-babies-ty-warner-2021-8?utm_medium=ingest&utm_source=markets) that coincided with the dot-com bubble. People speculated on the value of Beanie Babies toys, briefly pushing some of the rarer stuffed animals into the thousands of dollars versus the retail price tag of just $5 a piece. 

In recent years, everything from shoes to trading cards to watches have experienced a surge in value amid the COVID-19 pandemic, [though some of those booms have since turned into busts.](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/whiskey-rolexes-trading-cards-collectibles-federal-reserve-stock-market-outlook-2024-1?utm_medium=ingest&utm_source=markets)

The SEC argued that unlike collectibles, when a crypto token is purchased, the owner is invested in the network or enterprise behind the token.

"When they buy this token, they are investing into the network behind it. One cannot be separated from the other," SEC lawyer Patrick Costello said.

The SEC has leaned heavily on a 1946 Supreme Court decision that defined a security as an "investment of money in a common enterprise with a reasonable expectation of profits to be derived from the efforts of others." 

Whether that argument holds up in this court case remains to be seen. Failla ended the hearing without a ruling.
