# Downtown San Francisco Posters Promote Illegal Drug Use

> 来源：[https://sfstandard.com/2024/01/05/san-francisco-drug-users-tenderloin-posters/](https://sfstandard.com/2024/01/05/san-francisco-drug-users-tenderloin-posters/)

A group representing drug users in San Francisco has posted signs promoting drug use and criticizing law enforcement across the Tenderloin neighborhood, the center of the city’s open-air drug scene. 

Created by an entity called the Drug User Liberation Collective, the signs, measuring approximately 8 inches by 11 inches, aim to counter a recent initiative under Mayor London Breed to arrest people who use drugs in public, according to Nova Schultz, the creator of the campaign. 

The signs blame Breed’s recent drug-enforcement measures for a surge of overdose calls between May and September last year. They argue the negative stigma of drug use is responsible for problems in the Tenderloin—rather than drug use itself.

“Downtown is for drug users,” one sign reads. “Yea we buy drugs and do drugs here. … It’s very literally not hurting you, your business or the economy.” 

“Anti-drug user culture and laws = white supremacy,” reads another sign, citing data that shows Black people die from overdoses at a rate five times greater than white people in San Francisco.
