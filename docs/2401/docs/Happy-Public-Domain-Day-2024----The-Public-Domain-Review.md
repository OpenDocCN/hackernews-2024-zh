### Walt Disney’s *Steamboat Willie*

*Steamboat Willie* is a 1928 animated short film directed by Walt Disney and Ub Iwerks. Produced in black and white by Walt Disney Studios, the cartoon is considered the debut of both Mickey and Minnie Mouse, although both characters appeared in a test screening of *Plane Crazy* several months earlier. *Steamboat Willie* is especially notable for being one of the first cartoons with synchronized sound, as well as one of the first cartoons to feature a fully post-produced soundtrack, which distinguished it from earlier sound cartoons. Music for Steamboat Willie was arranged by Wilfred Jackson and Bert Lewis, and it included the songs “Steamboat Bill”, a composition popularized by baritone Arthur Collins during the 1910s, and “Turkey in the Straw”, a composition popularized within minstrelsy during the 19th century. The film has received wide critical acclaim, not only for introducing one of the world’s most popular cartoon characters but also for its technical innovation. In 1994, members of the animation field voted *Steamboat Willie* 13th in the book The 50 Greatest Cartoons, which listed the greatest cartoons of all time. However, the film has been the center of a variety of controversies, notably regarding the 1998 Copyright Term Extension Act passed in the United States. It was close to entering the public domain in the U.S. several times: each time, copyright protection was extended. It could have entered the public domain in four different years: first in 1955, renewed to 1986, then to 2003 by the Copyright Act of 1976, and then to 2023 by the Copyright Term Extension Act (also known pejoratively as the “Mickey Mouse Protection Act”) of 1998\. It has been claimed that these extensions were a response by Congress to extensive lobbying by The Walt Disney Company. ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steamboat_Willie))
