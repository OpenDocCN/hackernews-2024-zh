Speaking of Kovid Goyal, one of the pages I read was this one, which mentions him.

I’ve never used tmux or screen, relying instead on dtach (which is great!) and the terminal emulator’s scrollback feature. And the Emacs daemon. I’ve usually had two connections open, one with Emacs running and one for other things. Now that I’m on mosh, which doesn’t have scrollback, I’ve found myself using the Emacs shell more than previously, and also piping stuff through `&less`, a zsh-specific shortcut for getting both stdout and stdin into less. Not having scrollback sucks.
