She said all the mowers she tested had to physically touch the hedgehog in order to detect it, and some did not detect it at all and ran over it with the blades still running.

The researchers also worked alongside a rehabilitation centre in Denmark to establish how live hedgehogs reacted to a bladeless robotic mower.

Each hedgehog was tested twice and tended to act more shyly on their second encounter, suggesting they may eventually learn to avoid the machines.

Dr Rasmussen said: "Our new standardised safety test will greatly aid hedgehog conservation, by enabling manufacturers of robotic lawnmowers to ensure their models are hedgehog-friendly before they are put on the market."

Co-author of the study Dr Anne Berger, of the Leibniz Institute for Zoo and Wildlife Research in Germany, said: "Cut injuries from robotic lawnmowers are placing an enormous burden on many hedgehog care centres. ...[these] models could help prevent a considerable amount of animal suffering."

The research was funded by Husqvarna, STIHL, the British Hedgehog Preservation Society and the Carlsberg Foundation.

Fay Vass, chief executive of the British Hedgehog Preservation Society, said: "Hopefully, the results of this work will stop or drastically reduce the risk of robotic lawnmowers causing harm to hedgehogs."
