Are you an experienced software engineer who enjoys working on a fast-growing product that users absolutely love? If so, you've come to the right place.

You have a lot of choices about where you spend your time, so let's first tell you a little about us.

### üöÄ ABOUT FATHOM

We think it‚Äôs insane that so many people and businesses rely on notes to remember and share insights from their meetings.

Notes are time-consuming and stressful to create while trying to hold a conversation. Even when done well, notes are a poor solution compared to hearing something first-hand.

We started Fathom to rid us all of the tyranny of note-taking, and people seem to really love what we've built so far:

We're growing incredibly quickly and looking to grow our small but mighty team.

### üî• WHY YOU SHOULD JOIN US

*   **Opportunity for impact.** We‚Äôre established enough to ship instead of fighting fires and early enough that your work will have a real impact.
*   **Opportunity for learning.** You‚Äôll work alongside our 8-person, all-senior engineering team who have many years of industry experience and advanced degrees in Computer Science.
*   **Startup experience.** You‚Äôll work closely with our CEO, a 2X Founder/CEO with a background in computer science and product design.
*   **We embrace being fully remote.** We schedule meetings sparingly and instead heavily use async comms (Slack, Notion, Loom)

### ‚úÖ ABOUT YOU

We are looking for full-stack application developers to focus on building & evolving product features and to grow into ownership of application-level features. This specific role will focus on our third-party integrations (e.g., CRMs, Zapier, Slack) and our integrated applications (i.e., desktop/Electron application and Chrome extension).

*   **SaaS Experience.** You need to have at least 2+ years of experience writing customer-facing code for a SaaS product. We're looking for experienced folks who want to become masters of their trade, not junior folks looking for their first experience.
*   **Curious and low-ego.** We have a complex and high-throughput product where reliability is #1\. You should enjoy reading and understanding other people's code and be willing to take feedback.
*   **Focused on Winning.** The best code is the one that gets the feature in the hands of the customer first. We don't abstract or optimize prematurely. We're looking for folks who want to ship fast and win rather than those who take more pride in maximizing the elegance of their code.
*   **Strong Work Ethic.** This is a startup in the classical sense of the word. We work hard because that's the only way to win against incumbent competitors much larger than us.
*   **Generalist.** We're pragmatic and practical. We like working with generalists who can articulate the tradeoffs between different approaches, languages, or frameworks.

You should also live within 2 hours of a US time zone and speak English fluently.

### ‚öôÔ∏è TECH STACK

We use all of the following technologies. Your knowledge of these would be helpful, but you need not be familiar with all of them as we assume you're smart enough to pick up anything quickly.

*   Application Layer: Ruby/Rails/Sidekiq, Typescript/TSX, MySQL, Redis, Pusher, Electron
*   Platform Layer: GCP (GCS + GKE), Docker, GitHub Actions, CircleCI, Elasticsearch, Go
