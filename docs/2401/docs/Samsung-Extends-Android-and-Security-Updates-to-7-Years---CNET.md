Seven years of security and OS upgrades is a big jump up from the five years of security and four years of OS updates in last year's Galaxy S23 models and puts Samsung on par with [Google's pledge of seven years of updates](https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/google-promises-pixel-8-phones-will-get-software-updates-through-2030/) for its Pixel 8 phones.
