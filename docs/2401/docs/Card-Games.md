## Contributions and Feedback

The Pagat website was founded in 1995\. Its aim is to document the rules of traditional card and domino games for the benefit of players who would like to broaden their knowledge and try out unfamiliar games. It takes its name from the Pagat, the lowest trump in the Central European game of Tarock.

The site is edited by John McLeod ([john@pagat.com](mailto:john@pagat.com)). Please send me an email if you find any errors or have any comments or ideas for improvements, or if you would like to contribute something.

I would like to thank the many readers from all parts of the world who have helped to develop and expand the site by sharing information about the games that they play. I would also like to thank the following partner sites for their help and encouragement:
