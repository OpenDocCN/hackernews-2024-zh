# Electric cars suffer ‘unsustainable’ depreciation in secondhand market

> 来源：[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2024/01/18/used-electric-cars-lose-half-value-after-three-years/](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2024/01/18/used-electric-cars-lose-half-value-after-three-years/)

It predicted that a [wave of Chinese entrants](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2024/01/14/chinese-electric-car-invasion-shipping-crunch/) would further push down the cost of electric cars.

Sales of new battery-powered vehicles in Britain rose by 18pc last year but accounted for just 16.5pc of all new cars sold - a slight decline from 2022. 

New electric cars are still more than a third more expensive than their petrol or diesel equivalents. 

However, from this month, electric cars will need to account for 22pc of every manufacturer’s sales, which analysts expect to lead to heavy price cuts to encourage consumers.

Campaigners have said motorists will continue to [find electric cars too expensive](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/money/bills/cars/electric-car-drivers-face-500-hit-insurance-tax-bills-rise/) without government subsidies, which ended in 2022, or other incentives such as cuts to VAT.

Auto Trader said demand for used electric cars had picked up as prices fell, suggesting that the vehicles will prove popular once they are no longer more expensive than petrol rivals. 

It said that used electric cars on its site tended to sell up to five days faster than petrol ones.

This month, the Chinese manufacturer BYD [surpassed Tesla as the world’s best-selling electric car maker](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2024/01/02/chinese-car-giant-byd-overtakes-tesla-best-selling-ev-maker/). The company’s cheapest electric vehicle retails for £25,000 in the UK, roughly double what it costs in China, which Auto Trader said gave it room to further cut prices in Britain.

It predicted that one in six electric cars sold in Britain will be made by Chinese companies by 2030.

Ian Plummer, Auto Trader’s commercial director, said motorists had been “confused” by Rishi Sunak’s decision to push back a ban on petrol and diesel car sales from 2030 to 2035. 

He said that discounts applied to new electric cars meant most motorists would not bear the full cost of the depreciation in their value.
