# NPS Data API (Application Programming Interface) - Digital (U.S. National Park Service)

> 来源：[https://www.nps.gov/subjects/digital/nps-data-api.htm](https://www.nps.gov/subjects/digital/nps-data-api.htm)

The [NPS Data API](/subjects/developer/index.htm) is open and accessible to all developers who wish to use NPS data in their projects.

## What's an API?

An application programming interface (API) is a set of requirements that allows one application to talk to another.

**The NPS Data API allows official, authoritative data and content to be used not only on NPS.gov but also by internal and external developers in apps, maps, and websites.** We create the data once but, through the API, it can be used many times and in many products—no matter who creates those products.

## What data is available?

The [NPS API documentation](/subjects/developer/api-documentation.htm) includes detailed information about the type of data available, including:

*   **Alerts** - Announcements communicating information about hazardous, potentially hazardous, or changing conditions that may affect a visit to a national park
*   **Articles, People, and Places** - Titles, images, and short descriptions about shared content articles
*   **Campgrounds** - Location, contact, operating hours, site amenities, fee, and accessibility information for campgrounds in national parks
*   **Events** - Date, time, fee, and description of events taking place in national parks
*   **Lesson Plans** - Objectives, grade level, subject, duration, and standards information for lesson plans about national parks for teachers to use in their classrooms
*   **News Releases** - Title, abstract, and link to national park news releases, as well as an optional image
*   **Parks** - Location, contact, operating hours, and entrance fee/pass information for each national park, as well as at least five photos of each park
*   **Visitor Centers** - Location, contact, and operating hours information for visitor centers and other visitor contact facilities in national parks

## How can developers use the API?

Developers can register for an API key, get familiar with the API request format, and review API resources on the [NPS Data API website](/subjects/developer/index.htm).

## What's the future of the API?

Check out the [NPS API roadmap](/subjects/developer/api-roadmap.htm) to find out what is in development and being considered for addition next.
