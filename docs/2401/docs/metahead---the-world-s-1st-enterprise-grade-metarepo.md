# metahead | the world's 1st enterprise-grade metarepo

> 来源：[https://www.metahead.dev/](https://www.metahead.dev/)

If you’re using git submodules, metahead can enable big improvements to your workflow. The usual loop with submodules is to make a commit in a submodule, then to update the repos containing the submodule. By replacing submodules with metahead, you can make the code truly part of all the repos using the module, and a commit to the module repository will be seamlessly synchronized to all the users of this module. With one PR, update all the repos which use this code.
