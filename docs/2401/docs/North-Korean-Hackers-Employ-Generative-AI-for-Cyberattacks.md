North Korean hackers are using generative artificial intelligence (AI) solutions to identify targets and facilitate digital assaults, according to Seoul’s spy agency.

 Generative AI produces different types of data based on models and information it has learned with minimal to no human intervention.

South Korea’s National Intelligence Service (NIS) said that its government is now tracking activities related to Pyongyang’s technology.

 Under the advisory, NIS [outlined](https://www.ncsc.go.kr:4018/main/cop/bbs/selectBoardArticle.do?bbsId=Notification_main&nttId=112827&menuNo=010000&subMenuNo=010300&thirdMenuNo=#LINK) possible issues that may occur if North Korea tries to take advantage of the cyber domain.

“There are concerns about provocations, such as North Korea defining our country as a hostile country, and social chaos is possible by paralyzing infrastructure and administrative services for the public,” the NIS wrote.

South Korea added that Pyongyang’s cyber capabilities could promote false information and manipulate political matters.

 “There are concerns… to intervene in elections and promote distrust in the government, to influence the results of elections in major countries such as Korea and the United States and to divide national opinion,” the agency said.

“There are concerns about attempts to spread fake news and deepfake videos or hack election systems… cyber ​​information warfare to steal diplomatic strategies and cutting-edge technologies.”

## ‘More Hacking Attempts’

Meanwhile, the spy agency warned that hacking against South Korea could increase due to [Seoul’s growing strategic relations](https://www.thedefensepost.com/2023/12/06/us-munition-sale-south-korea/) with partner countries, including the US.

 “Fluctuating dynamics around the Korean Peninsula, such as intensified Korea-US-Japan cooperation and increased North Korea-Russia exchanges, are leading to more hacking attempts on our diplomatic, security, and advanced K-technology sectors by North Korea and China,” the NIS said.

 *Yonhap* [reported](https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20240124003300320) that despite the discovery, the intelligence service clarified that there are no signs yet regarding the North’s use of AI for actual military purposes.
