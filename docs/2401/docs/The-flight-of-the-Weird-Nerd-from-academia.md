# The flight of the Weird Nerd from academia

> *Most men will not swim before they are able to.” Is that not witty? Naturally, they won't swim! They are born for the solid earth, not for the water. And naturally they wont think. They are made for life, not for thought. Yes, and he who thinks, what’s more, he who makes thought his business, he may go far in it, but he has bartered the solid earth for the water all the same, and one day he will drown.*

*(Hermann Hesse- Der Steppenwolf)*

The above quote from *Der Steppenwolf* is a good encapsulation of the difficulty faced by The Intellectual, or shall we say, in more modern terms, The Weird Nerd. Weird Nerds are distinguished by their unyielding devotion to Truth, often placing it above social graces or conventional norms. That’s one of the reasons the Nerd is “drowning”, as Hesse put it. This species, while occasionally difficult to interact with, plays a crucial role in society, acting as an innovator and “village truth-teller”. In the last decades, Weird Nerds have found a sanctuary within the confines of academia, a natural habitat where their traits are not only tolerated, but often nurtured. In this symbiotic relationship, the wider world benefits from the intellectual pursuits and discoveries of the Weird Nerd, without the need to engage directly with its often annoying demeanour. It's a situation that seems to maintain a harmonious balance: the Weird Nerd is protected from “drowning”, while society at large reaps the rewards of its unique contributions without having to deal directly with it.

Has there been a disturbance in this equilibrium recently ? This is what

argues in a recent tweet:

He ascribes a lot of it to economic forces: in essence, The Weird Nerd has been poached away from Academia by simple market forces.

Completely anecdotally, I tend to agree with Nate.

What I will add, is that in The Weird Nerd’s place, I have noticed the proliferation of a different type of species in academia: what I call The Failed Corporatist. This is someone who stumbles upon academia not so much out of a love for The Truth, as due to an inability to thrive in corporate settings for various other, unrelated reasons. But the Failed Corporatist has a very conventional, corporate like mindset anyway. It usually loves process, admin and adding more admin and adding more process and METRICS and social conformity. This skill set enables them to ascend the ranks of academic administration, often gaining significant influence and control over The Weird Nerd. Confronted with this altered habitat, The Nerd often finds itself in a state of distress and confusion. Its intrinsic motivation clashes with the newly imposed corporate-like order and the demand for conformity, leading to frantic efforts to assert its natural tendencies. Unfortunately, these efforts are often met with resistance or outright rejection, not only from The Failed Corporatist but also from the broader world that the academic reserve is a part of. All in all, I think this disturbance means the remaining Nerds are further driven away.

Now, this is all anecdotal, but might we be on to something?

Biology Professor Jason Sheltzer has an interesting [thread](https://x.com/JSheltzer/status/1744412783989473567?s=20) today that points in this direction. Through an ad hoc analysis, Jason discovered that while 66% of the top national winners at the Intel/Westinghouse Science Fair from 1990 to 2002 pursued careers in academia, this number dropped to less than a third for winners from 2003 to 2014\. Now, for this to support my and Nate’s observations, you have to assume the Science Fair winners are good representations of the Weird Nerd. I personally think that’s a valid assumption! If you scroll down in his thread, you will see indeed some illustrious names of current academics among these winners. I’ll add to this list recent Nobel Laureate [Katalin Kariko](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katalin_Karik%C3%B3), who describes in her book having scored 3rd in her country in the Biology Olympiad. This is the closest thing Eastern European countries have to a Science Fair.

Now, if these Nerds are starting companies then maybe this is fine, they could do their research in those more entrepreneurial environments. It’s not ideal - in another [post](https://www.writingruxandrabio.com/p/can-the-markets-replace-academic) I explain that I do not think commercial research, even in small start-up settings, can replace fundamental academic research; still, it’s better than if they all went into Quant Finance, as Nate suggests.

But this “Entrepreneurial Nerd” hypothesis does not seem to be true. In fact, Jason’s analysis shows that Nate’s idea of what happened is more realistic:

Now, there is nothing wrong with working for Google or Quant Finance. But if I think start-up research is not going to replace academic research, that’s even less the case for big company research, especially Quant Finance! There’s a real risk here that even start-ups will run out of stuff to build on if high-quality fundamental research will cease to be done in academia.

Are we witnessing a radical restructuring of academia? And will The Failed Corporatist forever displace The Weird Nerd? And if this is the case, isn’t this what Metascience should be focused on, first and foremost, given the importance of human capital?
