The [GeForce RTX 4080 SUPER](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/graphics-cards/40-series/rtx-4080-family/) arrives January 31st, starting at $999\. Upgraded with more CUDA Cores and the world’s fastest GDDR6X video memory (VRAM) running at 23 Gbps, the GeForce RTX 4080 SUPER is perfect for 4K fully ray-traced gaming, and the most demanding applications of Generative AI.

In *Alan Wake 2, Cyberpunk 2077,* and *Portal with RTX*, players can immerse themselves in fully ray traced visuals even with every other setting cranked to the absolute max. It is 1.4X faster than the RTX 3080 Ti without frame generation, in the most graphically intensive games. With 836 AI TOPS, DLSS Frame Generation delivers an extra performance boost, making the RTX 4080 SUPER twice as fast as an RTX 3080 Ti.
