# Presently - intuitive insights into your time commitments.

### Visual helpers

*   Free weekends: if there are no events occurring or if the events occurring include `#free` in their description (e.g. birthday reminders).
*   Solo weekends: if you have more than one calendar toggled and there are no (or #free) events occurring in your primary calendar but there are blocking events in any of the other toggled calendars. E.g. Your partner has something booked but you're not invited (yay!).
*   Maybe/draft weekends: any event summary ending in a question mark is a draft event. Draft weekends are those that only include draft events in your primary calendar.

In addition, the following default hashtags are summarised in the stats summary if found in your event descriptions: `#travel, #host, #dogsitter`
