# WHY I HAVE NO MOBILE-FRIENDLY PAGES

# WHY I HAVE NO MOBILE-FRIENDLY PAGES

There are several reasons why I am not going to convert my web pages to be "mobile-friendly":

1.  I have over 400 pages. It would take years to do a good job.

    Nobody can keep up with the fast pace of change today.

2.  "Mobile device" standards are not even done yet.

    Standards for HTML 5 also aren't done yet.

3.  I already modified my pages twice to satisfy rules at different hosting sites.
    *   My first host required the backward compatibility of HTML 2.0.
    *   My second host required HTML 4.0 and they put my pages inside frames.
    *   My third host required XHTML 1.0 Strict for uniformity.
    *   This host requires only that pages not malfunction, so I kept XHTML 1.0.All of my previous hosts were bought out by competitors and then shut down.
4.  Pages that work on mobile devices often do not work on desktops and laptops.
    *   Your finger can fly over buttons to use other buttons. But mice can't fly.
    *   I can't use some menus because mouse hovers in the path switch menus.
5.  I do not have enough hosting space left for a double inventory of pages.
6.  I refuse to give up the character entity reference codes.
    *   Numeric character references were hard to use and remember.
    *   Character entity references were an advance in ease of programming.
    *   Deprecating entity references in HTML 5.0 goes back to the stone age.
7.  I teach computer science. Minifying is very poor programming practice.
    *   A minified source code is much harder to read, modify, or troubleshoot.
    *   My pages load in under 5 seconds on slow DSL. Too slow for you???
    *   Minified code does not pass World Wide Web Consortium validation tests.
8.  If you are too lazy to zoom and scroll to use a page, shame on you!
    *   My pages all fit in a 1024 × 768 pixel screen, or will scroll.
    *   My pages won't fall apart at different resolutions. But you must scroll.
9.  I want as much information as possible on one desktop screen.
10.  I hate cell phones:
    *   Other drivers on cell phones caused **every** auto crash I was a driver in.
    *   Students use cell phones to cheat on college exams.
    *   They took analog TV away so more people could have cell phones.Cell phone users shall do more work to see my pages, not desktop users.
11.  I hate touch screens. They always mess up what you select.
12.  I absolutely detest Windows 8/10 and Microsoft's new policies. Give me XP.
    *   All of the versions since XP get in the way of doing your work.
    *   All versions since XP waste your time with multiple menus to do something.
    *   Vista, 7, 8, and 10 were designed for artists, not for business or science.
    *   Added phone compatibility detracts from desktop compatibility.
    *   Windows 8 and 10 stop working if Microsoft disappears (e.g. ISIS attacks).
13.  Screens full of touchpads are not accessible to various disabilities:
    *   Lexical perception disabilities
    *   Arthritis and Parkinson's disease
    *   Motor function control disabilities
    *   Quadriplegic web browsers (have the no-fly problem a mouse has)

* * *

### Viewing my pages on a "mobile device"

Use one or more of the following methods:

*   Zoom and scroll
*   Attach a real mouse to your mobile device.
*   Smash the mobile device with a sledgehammer. Use a real desktop computer.
