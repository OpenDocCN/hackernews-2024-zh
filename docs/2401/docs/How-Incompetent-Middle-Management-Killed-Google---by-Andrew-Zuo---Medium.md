# How Incompetent Middle Management Killed Google

Ian ‘Hixie’ Hickson has departed Google. He was a big name in the Flutter community. Although I never really saw him much. He wasn’t as public as some of its other contributors. In fact I can’t find much about him. He has a photo on Wikipedia that appears to be quite old.

He did appear in a Flutter Boring show more recently though.
