# Post Office lied and threatened BBC over Horizon whistleblower - BBC News

Panorama journalists Matt Bardo and Tim Robinson were invited to Post Office HQ for an on-the-record briefing about the Horizon system.

Network manager Angela van den Bogerd joined PR boss Mark Davies and another senior manager, Patrick Bourke.

Ms van den Bogerd insisted nobody could change the sub-postmasters' accounts without their knowledge.

She said any alterations "would leave a footprint. And that's the important bit."

Matt Bardo asked: "So in sum, it is not now and never has been possible for anybody from Post Office or Fujitsu to interfere with transactions, without the clear knowledge of the sub-postmaster?"

Mr Bourke said: "It is 100% true to say we can't change, alter, modify, existing transaction data, so the integrity is 100% preserved."

"And that's true now and has been for the duration of the system?" Mr Bardo asked. "Yeah," said Ms van den Bogerd.

That wasn't true. Not then, and not for the duration of the system.

Since then, the Post Office has been forced to accept that Fujitsu staff could access and change accounts without the sub-postmasters' knowledge.

One of the Post Office's lawyers suggested in 2019 that Angela van den Bogerd and her colleagues had denied remote access was possible because they did not know at the time. He told the High Court: "It is a matter of enormous regret that the senior managers who dealt with Panorama were not aware that remote access to Horizon was possible."

But documents Panorama obtained for a follow-up programme in 2020 show the Post Office had known it was possible for years.
