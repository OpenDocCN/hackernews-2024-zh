# Haier Europe Eases Off On Legal Threat And Seeks Dialogue | Hackaday

> 来源：[https://hackaday.com/2024/01/22/haier-europe-eases-off-on-legal-threat-and-seeks-dialogue/](https://hackaday.com/2024/01/22/haier-europe-eases-off-on-legal-threat-and-seeks-dialogue/)

After initially sending a cease and desist order to [Andre Basche] – the developer of a Haier hOn plugin for Home Assistant – Haier Europe’s head of Brand and IoT has now penned a much more amicable response, seeking to enter into dialogue in search of a solution for both parties.

This latest development is detailed both in the [ongoing GitHub issue](https://github.com/Andre0512/hon/issues/147), as well as the [Takedown FAQ](https://github.com/Andre0512/hon/blob/main/takedown_faq.md) and [Timeline](https://github.com/Andre0512/hon/blob/main/takedown_timeline.md) document that [Andre] created to keep track of everything that’s going on [since we last checked in on the situation](https://hackaday.com/2024/01/19/haier-threatens-legal-action-against-home-assistant-plugin-developer/). As things stand, there is hope that Haier Europe may relent, especially as the company’s US division has shown no inclinations to join in on the original C&D.

In the confusion following the initial C&D announcement demanding the take-down of [Andre]’s hOn-related repositories, it was not clear to many which Haier was involved. As it turns out, Haier Europe as a separately legal entity apparently decided to go on this course alone, with [Haier US distancing themselves](https://www.reddit.com/r/homeassistant/comments/19a615l/haier_us_supports_home_assistant_and_open_iot/) from the issue. In that same Reddit thread it’s noted that GE Appliances (part of Haier US) has had a local API available for years. This makes Haier Europe the odd one out, even as they’re [attempting some damage control now](https://corporate.haier-europe.com/press-release/hon-app-a-message-about-our-iot-and-ecosystem-vision/).

Amidst this whirlwind of developments, we hope that Haier Europe can indeed reach an amicable solution with the community, whether it’s continued API usage, or the development of a local API.
