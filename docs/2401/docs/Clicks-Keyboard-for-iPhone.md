# Clicks Keyboard for iPhone

> 来源：[https://www.clicks.tech/](https://www.clicks.tech/)

Can honestly say this keyboard case is GREAT! Brilliant design and it gets SO MUCH attention everywhere I go… People literally go out of their way to ask me what phone I’m using and when I tell them it’s an iPhone they ask me where they can buy one. I just wish Clicks would send me a commission check :-)

Seriously though, if you buy one just make sure you check out the getting started guide so you understand how to hold it properly and how it works and go into it with some patience. You’re likely not going to be good with it immediately right out of the box.

I hadn’t typed on buttons since I had a BlackBerry Bold so I was more than a bit rusty at the start. But I spent a few hours over a couple days practicing and then it really “clicked”… I’m super fast on it now can even type without looking! Love my Clicks!!
