# Beej's Guide to Networking Concepts

This is barely a book. It's stuff that I put together for class and used to have in Canvas, and then slammed together into a volume. I'll improve it over time, but it's kind of just dumped here for now. Forgive me.

Please keep in mind ***this is an alpha-quality document***. If you have corrections, I'd love to hear them, but understand that even *I* might not have read that part of the guide yet. There are glaring errors! Additionally, I might not know what I'm talking about when it comes to something! So [e-mail me](mailto:beej@beej.us)!
