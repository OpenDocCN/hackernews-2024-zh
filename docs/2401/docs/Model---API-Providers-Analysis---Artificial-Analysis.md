# Model & API Providers Analysis | Artificial Analysis

> 来源：[https://artificialanalysis.ai](https://artificialanalysis.ai)

There is a trade-off between model quality and throughput, with higher quality models typically having lower throughput.

Quality: Index represents normalized average relative performance across Chatbot arena, MMLU & MT-Bench.

Throughput: Tokens per second received while the model is generating tokens (ie. after first chunk has been received from the API).

Price: Price per token, represented as USD per million Tokens. Price is a blend of Input & Output token prices (3:1 ratio).

Median across providers: Figures represent median (P50) across all providers which support the model.
