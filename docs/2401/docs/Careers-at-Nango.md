# Careers at Nango

## The Product

Nango simplifies the process for engineers to integrate their software with external APIs. Our open-source platform acts as a one-stop solution for all product integrations.

Despite companies investing $2B annually in creating product integrations, they often miss out on significant revenue due to the absence of crucial integrations. With Nango, businesses can integrate once and immediately tap into a suite of 130+ integrations. This not only saves on engineering expenses but also captures more opportunities and wins deals. 

There's a growing trend towards enhancing software products with integrations, especially among LLM apps that require data imports from external systems.
