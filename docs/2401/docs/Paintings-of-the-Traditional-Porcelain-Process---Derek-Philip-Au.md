## "Export" Art

For more authoritative information about the process of porcelain production please see *“*[*Science and Civilisation in China: Volume 5, Chemistry and Chemical Technology”, Part 12, "Ceramic Technology"*](https://www.google.com/books/edition/Science_and_Civilisation_in_China_Volume/0CP_zAEACAAJ?hl=en)by Rose Kerr & Nigel Wood as well as [*“Chinese Glazes: Their Origins, Chemistry and Re-creation”*](https://www.google.com/books/edition/_/NGw8DUuNywYC?hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjBn-L2koOEAxVNFFkFHZeqCrUQ7_IDegQIExAD) by Nigel Wood.

During the 18th Century, Guangdong province was the hub for trade with the West. The dialogue between Western merchants and artists with both painters and porcelain producers resulted in a unique blend of Chinese and Western styles. This blend was reflected in the painting styles for both Export Paintings as well as Export Ceramics (specifically, Canton Porcelain or *guangcai*).

*Note: Christies has a wonderful online exhibition regarding the dialogue between East and West and how it influenced both painting and porcelain decoration:* [*"East greets West — the pictorial legacy of the China Trade"*](https://www.christies.com/features/The-pictorial-legacy-of-the-China-Trade-9505-1.aspx)

Of particular interest to ceramicists are sets of Export Paintings that detailed traditional Chinese porcelain-production techniques. The basis for these paintings can be traced back to a set of illustrations of porcelain production made in the Qianlong reign and annotated by Tang Ying, the Superintendent of the Imperial porcelain works in Jingdezhen who was hugely influential in the development of Chinese ceramics. (There's a good translation of this work on [http://gotheborg.com](http://gotheborg.com/): [Twenty Illustrations of the Manufacture of Porcelain](http://gotheborg.com/twentyillustrations/tangyingindex.shtml))

Perhaps copies of copies of copies, these sets of Export Paintings that detail porcelain production have some obvious flaws, and titles and characters are often different than modern ones. (For example, using 油 instead of 釉.) Furthermore, it's apparent that Guangdong had a different vocabulary for various aspects of the porcelain craft, as the words used in these paintings often differ from descriptions of ceramics production written in Jingdezhen and Tang Ying. It's doubtful that anyone involved in the production of these paintings had ever themselves visited Jingdezhen and documented porcelain craft first-hand. Regardless, these paintings contain some very interesting details of porcelain production while also serving as examples of cross-cultural exchange. (In this case, exchange not only between the West and East, but between Jingdezhen and Guangdong.)

Here's a lovely set of Guangzhou Chinese export paintings from the V&A. The original set contained 24 paintings but I've only found 22 on the V&A website.

[There's no direct link to the set of paintings, but you can click here to search for them on the V&A website.](https://collections.vam.ac.uk/search/?listing_type=imagetext&offset=0&limit=45&narrow=1&extrasearch=&q=porcelain+painting+guangzhou&commit=Search&quality=0&objectnamesearch=&placesearch=&after=&before=&namesearch=&materialsearch=&mnsearch=&locationsearch=)

### Mining Porcelain Stone

I'm not sure if a porcelain stone ([*petuntse*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petuntse)) mine is actually depicted here, if so this mine seems to be located perilously close to rice paddies and a river.
