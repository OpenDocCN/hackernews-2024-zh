# Amber Smalltalk

> 来源：[https://amber-lang.net/](https://amber-lang.net/)

## A new language and live environment made for the web.

The Amber language is deeply inspired by Smalltalk. It is designed to make client-side development faster and easier. Amber includes a live development environment with a class browser, workspace, unit test runner, transcript, object inspector and debugger.

Amber is written in itself, including the compiler, and compiles into efficient JavaScript, mapping one-to-one with the JS equivalent.
