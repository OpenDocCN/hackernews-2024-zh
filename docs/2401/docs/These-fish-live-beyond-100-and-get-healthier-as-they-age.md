# These fish live beyond 100—and get healthier as they age

Now, the new study, [published recently in *Scientific Reports*](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-44328-8)*,* confirmed that two more buffalofish species—the smallmouth buffalo and the black buffalo—can live more than a hundred years, making it the only known genus of animal besides the marine rockfish, *Sebastes, *that has three centenarian species.

This is not to say that other animals can’t achieve remarkably long life spans. [Greenland sharks have the greatest longevity of any living vertebrate](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/article/greenland-sharks-animals-science-age), reaching at least 250 years old.

What’s more, research has revealed that buffalofish continue to live their best lives into their upper 80s and 90s, with better stress response and immune function relative to younger individuals.

“The one takeaway is that buffalofishes do not conform to preconceived notions,” says study leader [Alec Lackmann](https://scse.d.umn.edu/faculty-staff/alec-lackmann), a fish expert at the University of Minnesota. “They defy expectations.”

## Desert discovery

For the Arizona study, a few dozen anglers, including Black, caught 222 buffalofish at Apache Lake from July 2018 to July 2023\. Twenty three were humanely euthanized and donated to the research team, who estimated the fishes’ ages by removing and analyzing tiny ear stones called otoliths. These calcium carbonate structures, which allow fish to hear and sense vibrations in the water, form a new layer each year that can be read somewhat like tree rings.
