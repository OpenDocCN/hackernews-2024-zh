Paul Biggar is out of the picture for his online Gaza comments

A second Irish tech entrepreneur has lost his job over social-media posts about the Israel-Hamas conflict. Paul Biggar, a Dubliner now based in New York, has been dropped from the board of CircleCI, the software-developing company he founded. I Can’t Sleep was the title of a blog Biggar posted on December 15, in which he claimed the tech industry was complicit in “genocide” in Gaza, and effectively called for a boycott of “investors who whitewash genocide”, citing the likes of Sequoia Capital.

Jim Rose, ceo of CircleCI, responded by pointing out on social media that “Paul does not speak on behalf of” the San Francisco-based company, which he declared was “committed to our customers in Israel and around the world”. Soon afterwards, however, Rose posted: “Effective December 22, Paul Biggar is no longer a director at CircleCI. We thank him for his contributions on the board and wish him the best for what’s next.”
