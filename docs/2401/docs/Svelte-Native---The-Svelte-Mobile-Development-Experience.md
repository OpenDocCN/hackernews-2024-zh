# Svelte Native • The Svelte Mobile Development Experience

> 来源：[https://svelte-native.technology/](https://svelte-native.technology/)

Svelte Native is a new approach to building mobile applications using NativeScript. Where other JavaScript mobile development frameworks like React Native and NativeScript-Vue do the bulk of their work on the *mobile device*, Svelte Native shifts that work into a *compile step* that happens when you build your app.

Instead of using techniques like virtual DOM diffing, Svelte writes code that surgically updates the native view widgets when the state of your app changes.
