Choose a platform from the left.

### Source code

Anki's source is available on GitHub. There are instructions for building in the docs/ folder. If you encounter problems with the build system please let us know, but please note the expectation is that you are able to dig into basic issues by yourself. If you have no programming experience, please use the packaged version instead.

If you encounter bugs while running Anki from source, please check to see if you can reproduce them in the packaged version, as the Qt version or other libraries on your system can be the cause of some problems.

### Development

The latest code is located on [GitHub](https://github.com/ankitects/anki).

Please see the files in docs/ for further instructions.
