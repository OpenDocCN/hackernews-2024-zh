# Important update for LTSE Equity customers

> 来源：[https://equity.ltse.com/lp/important-updates](https://equity.ltse.com/lp/important-updates)

LTSE Equity Customers: 

‍

As of April 30, 2024, we no longer support our Cap Table Management solutions or other tools. For this, we have partnered with Astrella to offer you the option for Astrella^Ⓡ by Equiniti to become your cap table provider. If you would like a copy of your LTSE Equity data, please reach out to [support@ltse.com](mailto:support@ltse.com). To start the process of transferring to Astrella, [please fill out this form](https://share.hsforms.com/1QAhVClS4QPGe22mDNnal8Q5lokp).

‍

We have a nearly four-year working history with the Astrella team and know they will be a great solution for our customers. Astrella will honor our customers' payment terms through your annual renewal date. You’ll have a new login portal, but Anashe Barton will still be your point of contact. Anashe has joined the Astrella team and will be available to help with your transition to Astrella and to support you going forward.

‍

Astrella has a dedicated support team that remains committed to making this transition seamless for you. LTSE Equity began to transfer clients when we first announced this sunset in 2023, and we have developed a seamless process for you. We’ve also developed FAQs to answer some of the questions you may have. 

‍

We appreciate your trust in LTSE Equity and look forward to the possibilities Astrella brings to your equity management needs. If you would like to speak with the team at Astrella, please reach out to Anashe Barton at anashe.barton@equiniti.com.

‍

Sincerely,

‍

The LTSE Equity Team
