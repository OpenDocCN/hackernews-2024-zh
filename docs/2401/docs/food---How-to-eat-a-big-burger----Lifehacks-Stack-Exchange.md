**How to eat a big burger?**

When in Cache Creek,BC I always stop in at [Hungry Herbies](https://www.zomato.com/cache-creek-bc/hungry-herbies-cache-creek/menu) and eat their enormous ***Monster Burgers***.

No matter which way you decide to eat your burger, you will end up losing something of the word etiquette. Nevertheless, this is what I find helpful when eating burgers that only the Flintstones can truly enjoy.

Before cutting the burger in half, I pierce burger with six (6) toothpicks as well as squish it to accommodate my mouth and then I cut the sandwich in half. Make sure that the tomatoes are well pierced or they will make a quick dash to freedom when eating your meal.

As I eat my hamburger, I remove the toothpicks when needed in order to enjoy my food. Occasionally I will have to remove a toothpick and place it in another spot in the hopes of not letting this monstrosity win and spilling onto the plate or even worse me.

Somewhat of a chore this burger is to eat, but in the end I usually do a fine job at not being messy.

I am not one to stand by protocol or etiquette and most people do not mind my eating the **Monster Burger** in this fashion.
