# The unawareness of PNG and EXR — SCIENTIA

Screen-grabs can be taken in JPG, as for image-for-the-web export (Behance, Artstation, folio-websites, etc), especially with a low compression (i.e 100% quality option from JPG exporter, or slightly lower).

The “JPG awful compression” that some say, is a **myth**. JPG compression isn’t extreme enough to be unusable or unviewable, especially within a proper digital imaging pipeline chain, the JPG export results in a virtually pristine image file.
