# Shutting down the letsblock.it project and its official instance

Two years after being published, the letsblock.it project is used by hundreds of users and ran thanks to [dozens of contributors](https://github.com/letsblockit/letsblockit/?tab=readme-ov-file#thanks-to-our-contributors) and [financial sponsors](https://opencollective.com/letsblockit#section-contributors) who I am grateful for.

Unfortunately, we are fighting a losing battle in a commercial internet that is becoming more user-hostile everyday. I decided to move on and shut it down. **This project is making the commercial web more bearable, but I’d rather spend my energy on making the non-commercial web more attractive.** I want to support communities and applications that respect their users and value what we have to say. These websites don’t need letsblock.it rules, because they don’t shove low-quality content and anti-features down our throats.

## What will happen

**The project will cease operations at the end of June 2024**, meaning that:

*   The official instance hosted at letsblock.it will be shut down and its database destroyed.
*   Self-hosting will not be supported anymore, and no release of the server will happen after June. The GitHub project will be archived for a short while, then deleted.
*   In the meantime, security maintenance will continue, but creating new accounts is disabled and the rules will not receive any fix or update.

## What’s next for you

*   Existing users can still log in and update their filters. They should go to their [user preferences page](/user/account) and download a generated version of their rules, or export their parameters to use on another instance.

*   **I encourage you to look out for non-commercial or more user-centric alternatives to the websites you have been using letsblock.it for**, but in the meantime, you can check out:
