# Minimum Wage Clock · Luna’s Blog

> 来源：[https://moonbase.lgbt/blog/minimum-wage-clock/](https://moonbase.lgbt/blog/minimum-wage-clock/)

This began as a quick-and-dirty experiment ^(to visualize the UK [National Minimum Wage](https://www.gov.uk/national-minimum-wage-rates) in real-time, inspired by Blake Fall-Conroy’s [Minimum Wage Machine](https://www.blakefallconroy.com/minimum-wage-machine.html).)

Then I added the US [Federal Minimum Wage](https://www.dol.gov/general/topic/wages/minimumwage), since a sizeable proportion of this blog’s readership are US-based. Did you know the US also has a [Youth Minimum Wage](https://webapps.dol.gov/elaws/whd/flsa/docs/ymwplink.asp)? I didn’t.

Then I got curious, and added some CEOs for comparison. The vast disparity is nothing new to me, but seeing it like this...

It’s fucking sobering.

**[Update 2024-01-05]** By popular request, you can now input your own hourly wage to see how that compares. I’ve also provided some clarifications about the CEO counters further down.

The UK and US minimum wage numbers are, to the best of my knowledge, accurate at the time of publishing. Additionally, the code has been written to account for the changes to the UK minimum wage taking effect on April 1^(st) 2024\. If you’re reading this in the far future, the numbers presented here may no longer reflect reality.

CEO *annual* compensation was taken from the [American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations](https://aflcio.org/paywatch/highest-paid-ceos) (AFL-CIO). *Hourly* estimates were then derived by assuming 260 weekdays in a year, and 8 hours worked per day.

***[Update 2024-01-05]** A number of commenters rightly pointed out that the CEO counters are somewhat misleading, so I’d like to offer some clarifications. The counters indicate the CEOs’ *total compensation* for the fiscal year ending in 2022, which is broken down as follows:

*   Mark Zuckerberg took a salary of $1 for the year, with a further $27,110,417 of “other compensation” (whatever that means).

*   David Zaslav took a salary of $3,057,692, with a further $12,025,683 in stock awards, $1,448,138 in option awards, $21,831,456 in non-equity incentive plan compensation, and $925,489 of other compensation.

*   Reed Hastings took a salary of $650,000, with a further $49,408,182 in option awards and $1,015,055 of other compensation.

*   Satya Nadella took a salary of $2,500,000, with a further $42,269,560 in stock awards, $10,066,500 in non-equity incentive plan compensation, and $110,250 of other compensation.

*   Tim Cook took a salary of $3,000,000, with a further $82,994,164 in stock awards, $12,000,000 in non-equity incentive plan compensation, and $1,425,933 of other compensation.
