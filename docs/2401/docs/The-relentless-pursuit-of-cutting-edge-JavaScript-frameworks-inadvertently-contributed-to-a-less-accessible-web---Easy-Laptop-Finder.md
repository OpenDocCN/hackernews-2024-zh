# The relentless pursuit of cutting-edge JavaScript frameworks inadvertently contributed to a less accessible web | Easy Laptop Finder

The relentless pursuit of “cutting-edge” JavaScript frameworks inadvertently contributed to a less accessible web, disproportionately impacting users with devices and network conditions unable to (1) download the huge payloads associated with these frameworks and (2) handle the memory required to execute framework code in the browser. The emphasis on creating “zippy” and highly interactive web applications may have been nice for some consumers but entirely cut off access for others.

What’s worse, the people who tend to own lower-power devices and people in areas with slower internet connection are often the ones who could benefit the most from well-supported access to the web (e.g., to access government services).

The push for interaction also may have taken a toll on web accessibility: while newer development toolchains may include some accessibility linting, I have witnessed that be largely outweight by developers recklessly showing and hiding elements all over the page with little regard for those who use screen-readers.

I’m not sure we can ever get there, but a more reasonable approach would be prioritizing information access and accessibility over flashy interfaces. The one thing the web gives us over all else is the proliferation of and easy access to information. Let’s not throw that away for some flashy new interfaces.
