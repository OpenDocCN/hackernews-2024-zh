# An Easy Fix by christina 死神

You are an engineer at *40 More Servers Studios*, makers of the hit online game **Facebreaker**.

It's 10am on a Thursday. Any other week, this would be patch day, but today it's not.

Instead, you've got a clear calendar, no meetings, and only one bug left to fix before the end of the sprint tomorrow. It's a weird one, but you've finally figured out how to fix it, and you're super happy about that.

Sure is a nice day you've got planned. Would be a shame if something happened to it.
