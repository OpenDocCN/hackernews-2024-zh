The IPv4 protocol, a key element of Internet communication since the 1980s, has effectively served to allocate unique addresses for devices connected to the Internet. However, as the number of devices and services increased, IPv4 became insufficient due to the limited number of addresses. The transition to IPv6, which offers an almost unlimited number of addresses, is necessary to ensure the scalability, security and efficiency of the Internet infrastructure.
