Pornhub is introducing an even more stringent performer verification policy, and will soon require performers upload proof of consent from their scene partners in addition to their IDs.¬†

Before this new policy, performers were required to keep records, including IDs and release agreements, of anyone else who appeared in their content. As of last month, performers were required to submit those IDs for approval by the platform before uploading a video featuring a new co-performer. Next week‚Äôs policy change adds proof of consent to those requirements.¬†
