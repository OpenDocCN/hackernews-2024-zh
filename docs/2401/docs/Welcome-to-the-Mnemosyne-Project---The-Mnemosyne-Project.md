# Welcome to the Mnemosyne Project | The Mnemosyne Project

The Mnemosyne Project has two aspects:

*   It's a free flash-card tool which optimizes your learning process.
*   It's a research project into the nature of long-term memory.

We strive to provide a clear, uncluttered piece of software, easy to use and to understand for newbies, but still infinitely customisable through plugins and scripts for power users.

### Efficient learning

Mnemosyne uses a sophisticated algorithm to schedule the best time for a card to come up for review. Difficult cards that you tend to forget quickly will be scheduled more often, while Mnemosyne won't waste your time on things you remember well.

### Memory research

If you want, anonymous statistics on your learning process can be uploaded to a central server for analysis. This data will be valuable to study the behaviour of our memory over a very long time period. The results will be used to improve the scheduling algorithms behind the software even further.
