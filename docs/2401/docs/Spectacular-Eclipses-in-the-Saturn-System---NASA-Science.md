# Spectacular Eclipses in the Saturn System - NASA Science

Saturn has *dozens* of moons, not to mention the rings. Within this bustling “mini-solar system,” eclipses happen relatively frequently during certain seasons, and the Cassini spacecraft has captured some of these moments with its cameras. In addition, from its vantage point in space Cassini sometimes witnesses occultations of the Sun, when Saturn blocks out the light of the Sun as seen from the spacecraft. Cassini also images moons and rings at high phase angles, which means the subject is backlit by the Sun, with the Sun just out of the frame. These situations can lead to even more spectacular sights.
