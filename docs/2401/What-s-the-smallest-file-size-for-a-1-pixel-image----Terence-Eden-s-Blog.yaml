- en: There are lots of new image compression formats out there. They excel at taking
    large, complex pictures and algorithmically reducing them to smaller file sizes.
    All of the comparisons I've seen show how good they are at squashing down big
    files.

    files?

    as a PNG. I then used [Squoosh](https://squoosh.app) to convert it to a variety
    of modern formats using different encoding options. This is what I found:'

    Stefanov's "Minimum viable no-image image src"](https://www.phpied.com/minimum-viable-no-image-image-src/).
    That creates a 42 byte SVG with no image data in it - so I thought I'd see what
    happens if you make a displayable image.

    compress the AVIF (203 Bytes), JPG (69 Bytes), BMP (63 Bytes), and ICO (30 Bytes)
