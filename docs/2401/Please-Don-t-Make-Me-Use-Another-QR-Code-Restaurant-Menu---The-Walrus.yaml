- en: I recently travelled to Italy, and the first pleasure of every meal there was
    reading the menu. Phrases like “risotto al nero di seppia, burrata e ricci di
    mare”— risotto with cuttlefish ink, burrata, and sea urchins—and “paccheri pestati
    cunzati con gamberi, pistacchi e bisque”—paccheri pasta with crushed seasonings
    and with shrimp, pistachio, and bisque—felt like a rich prelude to the food itself.
    On a rooftop patio in Florence, I was handed both the regular menu and a supplementary
    sheet of paper. I happened to be there during white truffle season, and the sheet
    of paper listed all of the dishes they made with the delicacy. I sat there, literally
    under the Tuscan sun, feeling like a character in a book—one that was very unlike
    my everyday self.

  zh: 我最近去了意大利，每顿饭的第一大乐趣就是阅读菜单。像“risotto al nero di seppia, burrata e ricci di mare”—意思是墨鱼汁烩饭，意大利酪乳和海胆—以及“paccheri
    pestati cunzati con gamberi, pistacchi e bisque”—大通粉配虾，开心果和浓汤—这样的短语感觉像是对食物本身的丰富序幕。在佛罗伦萨的天台露台上，我被交给了普通菜单和一张补充纸。我碰巧在白松露季节来到了那里，那张纸列出了所有用这种美味食材制作的菜肴。我坐在那里，真的感觉就像是在图书中的一个角色，一个与我日常生活截然不同的角色。
- en: One of the chief pleasures I get from reading is in poring over the descriptions
    of [food](https://thewalrus.ca/tag/food/). Give me a banquet scene or a dinner
    party where the wine pairs perfectly with both the entrée and whatever dramatic
    revelation is about to come, and I am rapt. Battle scenes bore me, but reading
    a character’s grocery list enchants me. Maybe that’s why I love restaurant menus
    so much—a well-written one can feel like a piece of literature in and of itself.

- en: Part of the magic of those Italian meals was not just in reading the menus but
    in encountering them as physical objects, feeling their weight in my hands and
    touching the grain of their paper. There was a world of difference from the last
    menu I’d encountered in North America, which had to be accessed via QR code. That
    meal had been at a nice restaurant, with flowers on every table and friendly service,
    but having to begin my meal by squinting at a smudgy screen did somewhat take
    away from the experience.

  zh: 那些意大利餐的魔力之一不仅在于阅读菜单，还在于将它们作为实体物体遇到，感受它们在手中的重量并触摸它们的纸质。与我在北美遇到的上一个菜单相比，确实有天壤之别，后者必须通过二维码获取。那顿饭是在一家不错的餐厅吃的，每张桌子上都有鲜花，服务也很友好，但不得不从一个模糊的屏幕上开始我的餐点确实有些影响了我的体验。
- en: QR codes, or quick response codes, aren’t new—they’ve been around since 1994,
    though they weren’t initially widely adopted outside of Asia. During the pandemic,
    their ability to offer contact-free interactions led to a rise in their use in
    the rest of the world, including at restaurants. But even as more and more restrictions
    were dropped, many of the QR code menus stayed. Hospitality Technology’s [2022
    Restaurant Technology Study](https://hospitalitytech.com/2022-restaurant-technology-study)
    reported that 66 percent of restaurants in the US used QR code menus, and 19 percent
    of restaurants planned on adding them. The stats for Canadian restaurants are
    similar, according to the *Toronto Star*, which [pointed](https://www.thestar.com/business/pandemic-gives-qr-codes-a-second-wind-in-the-food-industry/article_c6a56065-81e1-582d-8f53-1755d6ea54d7.html)

    used QR codes at restaurants or grocery stores in August 2021.

  zh: 二维码，或称快速响应码，不是什么新鲜事物——它们自 1994 年就存在了，尽管最初在亚洲以外并没有被广泛采用。在大流行期间，它们提供无接触互动的能力导致了它们在世界其他地方的使用增加，包括在餐厅。但即使越来越多的限制被取消，许多二维码菜单仍然保留下来。《Hospitality
    Technology》的 [2022年餐厅技术研究](https://hospitalitytech.com/2022-restaurant-technology-study)
    报告称，美国有 66% 的餐厅使用了二维码菜单，而有 19% 的餐厅计划添加二维码菜单。根据 *多伦多星报* 的报道，加拿大餐厅的统计数据与此类似，根据达尔豪斯大学的一项调查，每五位加拿大人中就有三位在
    2021 年 8 月使用了餐厅或杂货店的二维码。

    of dining out with friends or family, and I hate the way that QR code menus take
    me out of the shared moment and force me to look at my phone (which, of course,
    leads me down the rabbit hole of checking my various notifications). I hate the
    way QR code menus mean scrolling, pinching to adjust size, and sometimes juggling
    between multiple tabs instead of just having to glance over a page or two.

- en: Physical menus are more than just aesthetically pleasing; they can also serve
    as important historical documents. The New York Public Library has approximately
    45,000 menus dating from the 1840s, a collection that they’re in the process of
    digitizing through their “[What’s on the menu?](https://menus.nypl.org/)” project,
    and it’s amazing how much can be gleaned from those documents. The first and most
    obvious piece of information is what people were eating in a particular time and
    place—along with how much (or little) they paid for it. One of the menus in the
    NYPL’s collection is from Mart Ackerman’s Saloon in Toronto, where, back in 1856,
    diners could get a porterhouse steak with a choice of sides for $0.50—about $12
    in today’s terms—accompanied by a glass of Siberian cobbler, ladies’ fancy punch,
    or a cocktail simply called the eye opener, all priced $0.13—$1.50 today—or under.
    But there’s so much more that can be learned from these menus beyond just items
    and prices.

  zh: 实体菜单不仅仅具有美学上的吸引力；它们还可以作为重要的历史文献。纽约公共图书馆大约有来自1840年代的45000份菜单，他们正在通过他们的“[What’s
    on the menu?](https://menus.nypl.org/)”项目对其进行数字化处理，从这些文件中可以获得多少令人惊讶的信息。最显而易见的信息是人们在特定时间和地点吃了什么——以及他们为此付了多少（或少）。纽约公共图书馆收藏的一份菜单来自多伦多的马特·阿克曼酒吧（Mart
    Ackerman’s Saloon），那里的食客在1856年可以用0.50美元（按今天的价格约为12美元）购买一份带有多种配菜可选的波特豪斯牛排，附带一杯西伯利亚果酒、淑女特调酒或一杯名为“开眼”的鸡尾酒，价格都在0.13美元（按今天的价格约为1.50美元）以下。但是，除了菜品和价格之外，从这些菜单中还可以学到更多的东西。
- en: “I think the menus are really important because they’re archival traces of what
    people are eating, or what people are purchasing, or have the opportunity to purchase,”
    says writer and cultural historian L. Sasha Gora. “They tell so many different
    histories. These can be environmental histories—so, really thinking about how
    certain ingredients disappear, or reappear, or appear to begin with.”

- en: Gora leads a research group at the University of Augsburg dedicated to the culinary
    environmental humanities. Among other themes, the group has explored the idea
    of culinary extinction—namely, what happens when the animals and plants used for
    a popular food go extinct because we have eaten them out of existence? Take the
    passenger pigeon, for example, which died out in the early twentieth century thanks
    to overhunting. As it was going nearly extinct, you would think it would be disappearing
    from restaurant menus too. And yet, as passenger pigeon numbers rapidly declined,
    passenger pigeon pie was still on the menu, according to Gora, at the storied
    Delmonico’s Restaurant in New York City. Gora says it’s possible that the pie
    really did contain passenger pigeon meat, but it’s also possible that it was the
    meat of some other, more common pigeon. Either way, the menu gave customers a
    perception of abundance even as their appetites decimated the ecology around them.

- en: 'Menus can also give us insight into attitudes toward gender. One fascinating
    example from history is the so-called “ladies’ menu”—a menu printed without prices
    so that women wouldn’t know how much their dates were spending on them (the practice
    mostly disappeared after a California woman threatened a restaurant with a discrimination
    lawsuit). Gora has an example relating to gender and menus from her own life too.
    In an essay titled “[Today’s Special: Reading Menus as Cultural Texts](https://ecampusontario.pressbooks.pub/foodstudies/chapter/reading-menus/),”
    she recalls working as a cook at a restaurant that served two versions of the
    same meal: “The Dirty Brunch” and “The Clean Brunch.” “The Dirty” came with bacon
    and sausages and, her boss told her, tended to be ordered by men; “The Clean,”
    by contrast, came with hummus and salad and tended to be ordered by women.'

- en: 'But most of all, menus tell us about things that are ephemeral: foods, yes,
    but also often the places that serve that food as well. “A restaurant opens, and
    then it can run for a while, and then it closes, and then there are very few traces
    left,” says Gora. “So you don’t know what foods were being served, you don’t know
    how they were being contextualized. But if you have a menu, it actualizes the
    food, it preserves what was happening in the restaurant.”'
