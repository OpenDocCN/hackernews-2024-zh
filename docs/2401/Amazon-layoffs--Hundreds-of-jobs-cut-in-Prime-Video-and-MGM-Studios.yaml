    at the end of 2022 and continuing through 2023, Amazon initiated the largest layoffs

- en: We've taken significant steps towards our long-term vision of making Prime Video
    the first-choice entertainment destination for customers worldwide, and I'm proud
    of everything we've accomplished as a team to date. Our investments in programming,
    marketing, and technology have enabled us to expand our selection of blockbuster
    movies, hit tv series, live sports, the world's largest TVOD catalog along with
    over 650 partner Channels worldwide, and AVOD services including Freevee – all
    available in a single destination, delighting customers around the globe. And,
    through our acquisition of MGM, we've increased our investments in theatrical
    films and driven growth in MGM+ and our licensing and third-party production businesses.

- en: Yet, at the same time, our industry continues to evolve quickly and it's important
    that we prioritize our investments for the long-term success of our business,
    while relentlessly focusing on what we know matters most to our customers. Throughout
    the past year, we've looked at nearly every aspect of our business with an eye
    towards improving our ability to deliver even more breakthrough movies, TV shows,
    and live sports in a personalized, easy to use entertainment experience for our
    global customers. As a result, we've identified opportunities to reduce or discontinue
    investments in certain areas while increasing our investment and focus on content
    and product initiatives that deliver the most impact. As a result of these decisions,
    we will be eliminating several hundred roles across the Prime Video and Amazon
    MGM Studios organization.

    reductions. Notifications will be sent out shortly, and we expect all notifications
    in the Americas to be completed this morning (Pacific time), and most other regions
    by the end of the week. We are following local processes, which may include time
    for consultation with employee representative bodies, possibly resulting in longer
    timelines to communicate in some countries*.*

    not take lightly.  It is hard to say goodbye to talented Amazonians who've made
    meaningful contributions on behalf of our customers, team and business. Thank
    you for your dedication and work. To help with the transition, we are providing
    packages that include a separation payment, transitional benefits as applicable
    by country, and external job placement support.

- en: Our prioritization of initiatives that we know will move the needle, along with
    our continued investments in programming, marketing and product, positions our
    business for an even stronger future. Prime Video is one of the most popular benefits
    for Prime members, and one of most widely used entertainment destinations in the
    world. I'm proud of the work you do every day on behalf of our customers, and
    I'm looking forward to continuing to build our business for the future.
