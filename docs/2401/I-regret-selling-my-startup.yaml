- en: Selling my company was a milestone that many entrepreneurs dream of. It all
    started with a chip on my shoulder, arrogance that I knew better than everyone
    else, and a laptop, eventually growing into a successful company. In a [previous
    article](https://www.nothingeasyaboutthis.com/lessons-from-selling-a-bootstrapped-company-to-a-pe-backed-company/),
    I shared a bit about the process of selling my company. But today, I get to look
    back on all of that nearly two years later with the benefit of hindsight.

    here. Those not caused by mis-set expectations come from my own laziness and shortsightedness.
    I now look back on selling the company as the most expensive lesson I have ever
    taught myself.

    company to encourage you to dig a bit deeper. I am not saying do or don’t sell,
    I am encouraging you to really think through what you’re doing and why you’re
    doing it.

- en: My company was a bootstrap success story. From its inception as me consulting,
    to growing the team, to building multiple successful software products, our growth
    was a testament to hard work and determination. I wasn’t smarter, or better connected,
    or better financed, or with a better pedigree than my competitors.  We never took
    outside funding, which meant every decision, every risk, and every triumph was
    solely on me and my wallet. Years of this pressure eventually led me to wanting
    to get away from it all. For some this would be called burnout, but for me it
    was a personal incompatibility with parts of the business I don’t want to delve
    into in this post.

    a financial outcome, but I was also getting freedom from parts of the business
    I didn’t want to be around anymore. Financially, the sale put me in a comfortable
    position, though far from the lavish retirement many imagine.

    and work on a specific startup idea. I built the MVP in my spare time and had
    amazing traction within 6 months, until the market tanked in fall of 2022\. Then
    all my initial customers got laid off or projects terminated.

    I hadn''t gone to therapy prior to selling the company. Part of my problem with
    selling comes from the fact I had not identified my values ([https://www.therapistaid.com/therapy-worksheet/values-clarification](https://www.therapistaid.com/therapy-worksheet/values-clarification?ref=nothingeasyaboutthis.com))
    in advance. Once I knew them, it was obvious that 4 out of my top 10 would be
    negatively impacted by selling the company if I didn''t start another one afterwards:'

    agency and autonomy of being the founder also matched my personality and financial
    goals well. It’s hard to know this about yourself if you don’t pause the everyday
    cycle of building and growing to learn more about yourself. Now whenever I talk
    to founders I almost always push them towards getting into therapy not to fix
    any problem, but as a way to force a regular process of reflection and self understanding.

    wealth. What you don't know is that when you have a pile of money, you turn into
    a dragon. The goal becomes to sit on the pile of money and make sure it doesn't
    get smaller, and ideally grows on its own. This is surprisingly hard, and amongst
    other wealthy people and former founders I now know, this is one of the most frequent
    preoccupations. In fact, one of the categories people are interested in are cash
    flowing software businesses just like the one I had sold.

    offense vs defense. When I was the founder of a company I was always on offense
    working to grow and expand and find new success. Now I am working to defend what
    I have earned, while struggling with my inability to start something new.

    going to sell, make sure you have a team that is vouched for by at least 2 founders
    that have sold. I did a terrible job of hiring people to represent me and this
    hurt me significantly from a financial, tax, and legal perspective.

    that selling a company is a bad idea and that you shouldn’t do it. The point is
    that it’s important for you to take the time to understand why you’re doing what
    you’re doing, how it will impact your life, and make an informed decision.
