- en: If your company is using Carta's platform to manage employee stock options,
    there's a blind spot in the 83(b) election feature you need to know about if you're
    married and living in a community property state like California.

- en: 'Here''s the deal: Many startups offer early exercise of stock options, which
    can provide a big tax advantage to employees. Early exercise turns stock options
    into restricted stock, which normally requires an 83(b) election by the employee
    to avoid possible painful tax consequences as your stock vests.'

- en: 'Carta conveniently allows you to make the 83(b) election when you early exercise.
    However, the platform misses one IRS mandate: if you''re married in states like
    California, Texas, or Washington, your spouse must also sign the 83(b) form. Miss
    this, and you might face some serious tax headaches down the road, as the IRS
    could invalidate your election.'

- en: Carta does not provide a way to have your spouse sign the 83(b) form that they
    file on your behalf. They also don't conspicuously warn you about this requirement
    nor that their platform is non-compliant with it. *Startups can't even disable
    the 83(b) feature to prevent the risk that a married employee uses the feature.*
    It seems like a major oversight, especially since Carta is the most popular platform
    for managing startup stock options.

- en: So, what should you do if you're in this boat? *Manually file your 83(b)*. Don't
    use Carta to do it. Instead, download the form from the IRS website, fill it out,
    and mail it to the IRS within the strict 30-day deadline. You'll need to get a
    signature from your spouse, too.

    with your lawyer. Until Carta resolves this, it's up to the companies and their
    employees to navigate this.
