- en: In an ancient temperate forest in what is now Oregon, an insect dug deep into
    a sandy bank near a creek. There, in a damp burrow, she laid dozens of oblong
    eggs, about 50 in all. Despite her careful work building this underground nursery,
    none of the eggs would ever hatch. Instead, the eggs, enclosed within a pod, fossilized
    into a stony, mineralized mass. And now, 29 million years later, they stand as
    a record of insect reproduction that could be unlike anything paleontologists
    had seen before.

- en: Recently, micro-CT scans of the egg case revealed not only that it was millions
    of years old, but also that it was most likely made by a grasshopper. The eggs
    and overall nest construction closely resemble the eggs and pods of modern grasshopper
    species. This newly documented knowledge paints a clearer picture of that ancient
    ecosystem, confirming that grasshoppers were present and thriving there — and
    that some types of grasshoppers were burying their eggs underground.

- en: Insect eggs are extremely rare in the fossil record, and intact egg cases are
    even rarer. This is likely the only fossilized grasshopper egg pod on record,
    and it offers a view of their reproduction dating back to the Oligocene Epoch
    (33.9 million to 23 million years ago), researchers reported Monday in the journal
    [Parks Stewardship Forum](https://escholarship.org/uc/item/92p9g46q).

    insights to one of the least understood life stages of insects, particularly in
    the geologic past,” lead study author Jaemin Lee, an evolutionary ecologist and
    doctoral student at the University of California, Berkeley, told CNN in an email.

    that typically isn’t kind to fossilization, said study coauthor Dr. Nick Famoso,
    a paleontology program manager and museum curator at John Day Fossil Beds National
    Monument. The site, located in Mitchell, Oregon, is under the management of the
    National Parks Service.

    alongside plant matter. Such places tend to be anoxic, or oxygen-poor, and relatively
    static, Famoso explained. There, fossils can form in peace, untouched by currents
    or bacteria. But millions of years ago, a river or stream ran through this location.
    Nevertheless, conditions surrounding this egg pod were just right for it to stay
    buried and fossilize undisturbed in nearly perfect condition, despite the dynamic
    environment of flowing water nearby, Famoso said.

    and in clusters,” paleobiologist [Dr. Ricardo Pérez-de la Fuente](https://oumnh.ox.ac.uk/people/ricardo-perez-de-la-fuente),
    deputy head of research at the University of Oxford’s Museum of Natural History
    in the United Kingdom, said in an email.

    and their kin — in the fossil record, which is noteworthy,” said Pérez-de la Fuente,
    who was not involved in the research.

    of immature stages of insects, more particularly those of eggs,” Pérez-de la Fuente
    said. This branch of science, known as ootaxonomy, “can provide paramount data
    on the evolution, behavior and ecology of insects in deep time, but which tend
    to be neglected in paleontological studies.” What’s more, he added, the pod and
    eggs may offer clues about the environment where they fossilized.

    the egg case in the fossil beds in July 2012\. Schierup was conducting a routine
    visual survey of the site when he spotted the object, which was embedded in a
    chunk of rock that had rolled down a hill, Famoso recalled.

    swaddled the object in toilet paper, “and carefully returned to the visitor center
    where our lab is located,” Famoso added.

    had found a cluster of ant eggs. But Famoso was skeptical, as their curvature
    differed from the curves of ant eggs and pupae. His suspicions were corroborated
    by Lee, who first saw the object in 2022 during a visit to the John Day Fossil
    Beds. They brought the specimen to the University of Oregon’s Knight Campus in
    Eugene, where micro-CT scans were conducted by study coauthor Angela Lin, director
    of the X-ray Imaging Research Core Facility.

    everything together,” Famoso said. This wasn’t just a cluster of eggs — it was
    a type of subterranean egg pod called an ootheca, with the eggs cradled by a protective
    layer that had mineralized into a stony rind.

    Lee said. These are grasshoppers (order Orthoptera, suborder Caelifera) and heelwalkers
    (order Mantophasmatodea).

    0.18 inches (4.65 millimeters) long and 0.07 inches (1.84 millimeters) wide (this
    is comparable to the eggs of modern grasshoppers, though egg size can vary depending
    on the species). Scans revealed over two dozen more eggs buried in the matrix
    in four to five layers, arranged in a radial pattern. Some of the eggs were hollow,
    while others had filled with sediment, the study authors reported.

    clear that that was a fossilization structure,” Famoso said.

    for comparison. So Lee consulted a global insect egg database, containing more
    than 6,700 living species, to identify the eggs in the fossil pod.

    and curvature of the individual eggs to those of the living ones,” he said. “Such
    large, elliptically curved eggs in a large clutch size (~50 eggs in total) are
    unknown from any other living groups of insects other than grasshoppers and locusts.”

    ancient relatives of modern grasshoppers. The virtually pristine specimen also
    speaks to the level of preservation in the national park site’s fossil beds, Famoso
    added.

    what these things look like — that was something that was really exciting for
    us,” Famoso said. “There just isn’t anything else like this in the fossil record
    anywhere that we know of.”
