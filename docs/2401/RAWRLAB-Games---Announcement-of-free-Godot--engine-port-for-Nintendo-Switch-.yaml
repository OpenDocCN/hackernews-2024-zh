    allows small indies to tinker with Godot on the platform. W4 ports are more complex
    and meant for actual studios.”. We agree with him.'

- en: Well, not exactly. This port just solves one piece of a 10-piece puzzle. Porting
    a game to a gaming console requires a lot of work and knowledge about the platform
    to optimize it and comply with its requirements.
