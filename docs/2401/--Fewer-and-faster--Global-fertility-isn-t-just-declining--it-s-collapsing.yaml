    collapse in fertility. That‚Äôs something that‚Äôs never happened before with Homo

    how people will react over the next few decades, how mortality will evolve. **But
    what I want the listeners to understand is, for the very first time in the history

    rate in terms of fertility.¬† ‚Ä¶ My argument is the United Nations is underestimating
    how fast fertility is falling. Instead of 2084, I'm pushing this to 2060, let's
    say. And instead of 9.7, I will say that we will peak around 9.2, 9.1, and then
    we are going to start falling.**

    Well, at least they can argue about the *pace* of decline. And certainly some

    finds that not only has the demographic transition from high fertility to low
    fertility ‚Äúbeen completed or is ongoing in nearly every country,‚Äù but that ‚Äúthe
    speed of transition has increased over time‚Äù as the world has become more connected

    Fern√°ndez-Villaverde [notes](https://www.thepublicdiscourse.com/2021/10/78340/),
    for instance, major differences in birthrates between religious and secular groups
    today, whereas 50 years ago there was little difference. This suggests that societal
    and cultural factors strongly influence birth rates. People might start believing
    something different about families. Or the composition of a society may change
    due to religious citizens having more kids.

    unknown factor. [Fern√°ndez-Villaverde](https://www.thepublicdiscourse.com/2021/10/78340/):
