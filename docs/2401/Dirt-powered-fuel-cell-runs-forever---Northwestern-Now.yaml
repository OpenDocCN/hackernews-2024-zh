    are constrained to putting a battery in it or harvesting solar energy,” Yen said.
    “Solar panels don’t work well in dirty environments because they get covered with
    dirt, do not work when the sun isn’t out and take up a lot of space. Batteries
    also are challenging because they run out of power. Farmers are not going to go
    around a 100-acre farm to regularly swap out batteries or dust off solar panels.”

  zh: “如果你想要在野外、农场或湿地放置一个传感器，你只能选择在其中放置一个电池或者收集太阳能，”严说道。“太阳能电池板在脏环境中不起作用，因为它们被污垢覆盖，太阳不出来时也不起作用，并且占据大量空间。电池也是有挑战的，因为它们会用完电。农民不会围绕100英亩的农场定期更换电池或清理太阳能电池板。”
- en: To overcome these challenges, Wells, Yen and their collaborators wondered if
    they could instead harvest energy from the existing environment. “We could harvest
    energy from the soil that farmers are monitoring anyway,” Yen said.

- en: Making their first appearance in 1911, soil-based microbial fuel cells (MFCs)
    operate like a battery — with an anode, cathode and electrolyte. But instead of
    using chemicals to generate electricity, MFCs harvest electricity from bacteria
    that naturally donate electrons to nearby conductors. When these electrons flow
    from the anode to the cathode, it creates an electric circuit.

  zh: 1911年首次亮相，基于土壤的微生物燃料电池（MFCs）的操作类似于电池-具有阳极，阴极和电解质。但是，MFCs不使用化学物质产生电力，而是从自然捐赠电子给附近导体的细菌中收集电力。当这些电子从阳极流向阴极时，它创建了一个电路。
- en: But in order for microbial fuel cells to operate without disruption, they need
    to stay hydrated and oxygenated — which is tricky when buried underground within
    dry dirt.

- en: “Although MFCs have existed as a concept for more than a century, their unreliable
    performance and low output power have stymied efforts to make practical use of
    them, especially in low-moisture conditions,” Yen said.

    to develop a practical, reliable soil-based MFC. His expedition included creating
    — and comparing — four different versions. First, the researchers collected a
    combined nine months of data on the performance of each design. Then, they tested
    their final version in an outdoor garden.

- en: 'The best-performing prototype worked well in dry conditions as well as within
    a water-logged environment. The secret behind its success: Its geometry. Instead
    of using a traditional design, in which the anode and cathode are parallel to
    one another, the winning fuel cell leveraged a perpendicular design.'

    electrons), the anode is horizontal to the ground’s surface. Made of an inert,
    conductive metal, the cathode sits vertically atop the anode.

- en: Although the entire device is buried, the vertical design ensures that the top
    end is flush with the ground’s surface. A 3D-printed cap rests on top of the device
    to prevent debris from falling inside. And a hole on top and an empty air chamber
    running alongside the cathode enable consistent airflow.

- en: The lower end of the cathode remains nestled deep beneath the surface, ensuring
    that it stays hydrated from the moist, surrounding soil — even when the surface
    soil dries out in the sunlight. The researchers also coated part of the cathode
    with waterproofing material to allow it to breathe during a flood. And, after
    a potential flood, the vertical design enables the cathode to dry out gradually
    rather than all at once.

- en: On average, the resulting fuel cell generated 68 times more power than needed
    to operate its sensors. It also was robust enough to withstand large changes in
    soil moisture — from somewhat dry (41% water by volume) to completely underwater.

- en: The researchers say all components for their soil-based MFC can be purchased
    at a local hardware store. Next, they plan to develop a soil-based MFC made from
    fully biodegradable materials. Both designs bypass complicated supply chains and
    avoid using conflict minerals.

    the global supply chain for electronics,” said study co-author Josiah Hester,
