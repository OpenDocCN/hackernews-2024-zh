- en: IT TAKES THE ET5, an electric saloon from NIO, a Chinese carmaker founded in
    2014, a mere four seconds to accelerate from a standstill to 100kph. That is more
    or less the same as the Porsche Carrera, a German petrol-powered sportscar beloved
    by adrenalin junkies. Chinese electric vehicles (evs) are setting new standards
    for speed—in terms both of how fast they go and of how fast they are spreading
    around the globe. Already China’s streets are clogged with them. And if Chinese
    manufacturers have their way, America’s and Europe’s soon will be, too. An industry
    used to a sedate cycle of marginal improvements is being upended at “China speed”,
    says Ralf Brandstätter, Volkswagen’s boss in the country.

- en: In 2023, Chinese industry groups claim, China overtook Japan to become the world’s
    biggest exporter of cars, in part because of surging sales of EVs. In the final
    quarter of 2023, BYD, a Chinese firm, surpassed Tesla as the world’s biggest manufacturer
    of purely battery-powered vehicles, selling 526,000 of them to the American firm’s
    484,000\. As the shift away from the internal-combustion engine (ice) gathers
    pace, established carmakers are beginning to worry that Chinese upstarts might
    run them off the road.
