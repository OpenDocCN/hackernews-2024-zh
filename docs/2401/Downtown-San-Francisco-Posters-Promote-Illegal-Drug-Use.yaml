- en: Created by an entity called the Drug User Liberation Collective, the signs,
    measuring approximately 8 inches by 11 inches, aim to counter a recent initiative
    under Mayor London Breed to arrest people who use drugs in public, according to
    Nova Schultz, the creator of the campaign.

- en: The signs blame Breed’s recent drug-enforcement measures for a surge of overdose
    calls between May and September last year. They argue the negative stigma of drug
    use is responsible for problems in the Tenderloin—rather than drug use itself.

    here. … It’s very literally not hurting you, your business or the economy.”
