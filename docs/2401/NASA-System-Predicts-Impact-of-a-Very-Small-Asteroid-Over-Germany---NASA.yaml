- en: A small asteroid about 3 feet (1 meter) in size disintegrated harmlessly over
    Germany on Sunday, Jan. 21, at 1:32 a.m. local time (CET). At 95 minutes before
    it impacted Earth’s atmosphere, [NASA’s Scout](https://cneos.jpl.nasa.gov/scout/intro.html)
    impact hazard assessment system, which monitors data on potential asteroid discoveries,
    gave advance warning as to where and when the asteroid would impact. This is the
    eighth time in history that a small Earth-bound asteroid has been detected while
    still in space, before entering and disintegrating in our atmosphere.

- en: The asteroid’s impact produced a bright [fireball](https://cneos.jpl.nasa.gov/fireballs/),
    or bolide, which was seen from as far away as the Czech Republic and may have
    scattered small meteorites on the ground at the impact site about 37 miles (60
    kilometers) west of Berlin. The asteroid was later designated 2024 BX1.

- en: While NASA reports on near-Earth objects (NEOs) of all sizes, the agency has
    been tasked by Congress with detecting and tracking NEOs 140 meters in size and
    larger that could cause significant damage on the ground if they should impact
    our planet. Those objects can be spotted much further in advance than small ones
    like 2024 BX1.

    no hazard to life on Earth but can provide a useful demonstration of NASA’s [planetary
    defense](https://science.nasa.gov/planetary-defense) capabilities such as Scout’s
    rapid-response trajectory computation and impact alerts.

- en: The asteroid 2024 BX1 was first observed less than three hours before its impact
    by Krisztián Sárneczky at Piszkéstető Mountain Station of the Konkoly Observatory
    near Budapest, Hungary. These early observations [were reported](https://www.minorplanetcenter.net/mpec/K24/K24B76.html)
    to the [Minor Planet Center](https://minorplanetcenter.net/) – the internationally
    recognized clearinghouse for the position measurements of small solar system bodies
    – and automatically posted on the center’s [Near-Earth Object Confirmation Page](https://www.minorplanetcenter.net/iau/NEO/toconfirm_tabular.html)
    so that other astronomers could make additional observations.

- en: Scout, which was developed and is operated by the Center for Near Earth Object
    Studies ([CNEOS](https://cneos.jpl.nasa.gov/)) at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory
    in Southern California, automatically fetched the new data from that page, deducing
    the object’s possible trajectory and chances of impacting Earth. CNEOS calculates
    the orbit of every known NEO to provide assessments of potential impact hazards
    for the Planetary Defense Coordination Office ([PDCO](https://science.nasa.gov/planetary-defense))
    at NASA Headquarters in Washington.

- en: With three observations posted to the confirmation page over 27 minutes, Scout
    initially identified that an impact was possible and that additional observations
    were urgently needed. As astronomers across Europe reported new data to the Minor
    Planet Center, the asteroid’s trajectory became better known and the probability
    of its impacting Earth significantly increased.

- en: Seventy minutes after 2024 BX1 was first spotted, Scout reported a 100% probability
    of Earth impact and began to narrow down the location and time. As tracking continued
    and more data became available over the next hour, Scout improved estimates of
    the time and location. Since the asteroid disintegrated over a relatively populated
    part of the world, many photos and videos of the fireball were posted online minutes
    after the event.

    was [2008 TC3](https://cneos.jpl.nasa.gov/news/2008tc3.html), which entered our
    atmosphere and broke up over Sudan in October 2008\. That 13-foot-wide (4-meter-wide)
    asteroid scattered hundreds of small meteorites over the Nubian Desert.

    was detected seven hours before it entered Earth’s atmosphere over northwestern
    France. As with 2024 BX1, Scout accurately predicted the location and time of
    impact.

- en: With NEO surveys becoming more sophisticated and sensitive, more of these harmless
    objects are being detected before entering our atmosphere, providing real exercises
    for NASA’s planetary defense program. The details gathered from such events are
    helping to inform the agency’s [mitigation strategies](https://www.nasa.gov/directorates/smd/planetary-science-division/planetary-defense-coordination-office/nasa-releases-agency-strategy-for-planetary-defense-to-safeguard-earth/)
    should a large and hazardous object on a collision course with our planet be detected
    in the future.
