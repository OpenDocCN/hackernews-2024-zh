    a Duolingo spokesperson said that the company uses "AI for a variety of different
    functions and tasks," but conceded again that "there is some merit to the idea
    that AI is contributing to the reduction of our contract workforce."

    Duolingo bragged in a November letter to shareholders that the company was harnessing
    AI to produce "new content dramatically faster." Duolingo also reportedly uses
    AI to generate some of the voices heard in various in-app language scripts and
    to prompt AI-generated feedback to users.

    their former team''s remaining contractors are now tasked with simply checking
    AI-generated text for errors.'

    nuance of a given language. Trusting translation AI — meanwhile pushing remaining
    contractors to fact-check presumably high numbers of those "dramatically faster"
    content outputs — may well come at the cost of such nuance, potentially flattening
    the learning process and rendering language robotic.
