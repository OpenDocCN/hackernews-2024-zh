    for the service’s “pro” plan, and that it would honor those prices “forever”?
    Well, it turns out “forever” has an expiration date.

    legacy Pro plans are going away](https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569484&url=https://help.ifttt.com/hc/en-us/articles/16014462721435-Important-Update-to-the-Legacy-Pro-Plan&sref=https://www.techhive.com/article/1940144/ifttt-killing-pay-what-you-want-legacy-pro-plan.html&xcust=3-1-1940144-1-0-0),
    with current users on that plan slated to be migrated to the $5-a-month IFTTT
    Pro+ plan at the start of their next billing cycles.

    our current offerings,” as the web applet service has added “nearly 200 new services,
    and dozens of new features” since first offering a pay-what-you-want option for
    grandfathered-in users.

    the introduction of a paid Pro plan.

    October 7, 2020 could pay whatever they wanted for a year, with a minimum monthly
    payment of $1.99.

    access to Twitter applets from its free users](https://www.techhive.com/article/1921036/ifttt-to-pull-twitter-applets-for-free-users-add-more-restrictions.html),

    IFTTT paid subscription plans settled down to two: a $2.50-a-month Pro tier that
    (among other features) offers access to 20 applets, and a $5/month Pro+ tier that
    lets you create as many applets as you want.'
