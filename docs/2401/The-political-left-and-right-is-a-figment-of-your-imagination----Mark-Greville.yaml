- en: With a vague hint of a threat, an acquaintance demanded to know if I was “on
    the left or the right. Politically, I mean”. What he meant was the future of our
    potential relationship depended on my answer. The problem — I didn’t know. To
    be honest, I have trouble keeping up with what the left and right stand today.
    Are the left socialist? Are the right conservative? Where do liberals go? What
    about fascists and communists? It’s all so confusing. I asked him what I needed
    a side for. “Oh, we all need to pick a side, Mark”.

- en: I have visited the US a lot over the past 15 years. Living in Ireland, I am
    always struck by how passionate people are about political parties. Most people
    I’ve met consider themselves on the left (Democrat) or on the right (Republican).
    When I ask them how they pick a side, they speak about how their ethical and moral
    values form the basis for their worldview, and help them choose a side. And they
    choose with certainty. People with a sense of certainty have always fascinated
    me. I am the opposite. I never feel like I understand things deeply enough to
    have a definitive view. My opinions hang on by a thread. Except for a love for
    my family. And my love of Everton Football Club. I am certain about that.

- en: Sports increasingly influence our lives. Thinking about sports informs our thinking
    about the world. There is a problem with this — how we think about sports is terrible.
    Fans are angry, emotional, and biased. We chant, wear our team colours, and rail
    against the unfairness of the referee. We love ‘our’ players. We hate the opposition.
    We see goodness in our team, and can’t see things from the other side’s perspective.
    This style of thinking leaks into our political lives. We wear our party colours
    and chant our slogans. We complain about the ‘referee’ (any authority figures
    — see media, law, government). We love our party and learn to hate the opposition.
    Our side is correct, and the other side is wrong.

    We fanatics are in for the long haul. In sports, we deal with change — in fortunes,
    in players, in team ownership. But change is also part of the deal when you pick
    a side politically. The left and right are not fixed positions. The principles
    that were once a core belief will adjust and move. In college many years ago,
    some classmates chose the left because they believed in free speech. But this
    is shifting. A [2021 study](https://futurefreespeech.org//wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Report_Who-cares-about-free-speech_21052021.pdf)
    by the Free Speech Institute showed that in the US, Republican voters are now
    more in favour of free speech than Democrats. It has moved from left to right.
    A shift like this leaves political supporters in a quandary. Is a political principle
    more important than the side they support? Maybe a more useful question is — what
    political shifts would it take for you to switch sides? If you can’t ever imagine
    switching sides no matter the change, you have fallen into the sports fan trap.

    worry. There is no such thing as the left or the right. It is a figment of your
    imagination.

- en: In the book [The Social Construction of Reality (Berger and Luckmann)](https://geni.us/kwVwlv),
    the authors argue that knowledge comes from social interactions. We invent concepts
    to help explain the world to ourselves and others. The most useful are repeated
    and spread through interactions with others. Over time, these become objective
    truth. Take the idea of nationality. When I lived in England, I met people I felt
    so close to in attitude and appearance that they could have been family. However,
    in olden times, someone decreed that people on one side of the Irish Sea were
    English, and people on the other side were Irish. After a while, this idea spread
    through human interaction, and people started believing in the idea of two different
    countries. They saw themselves as similar to others on their side, and different
    from those on the other side. This idea has caused centuries of issues, even though
    it is an invented idea. It’s been around so long that it feels as real as the
    laws of gravity. But there is no law here, just an invention repeated for hundreds
    of years.

- en: The idea of a political right and political left is a social construction. It
    is a radically simplified way to see the world. It only exists because people
    have used it in the past. It is not the best model, or even a good representation
    of the complicated nature of political thought. There are only two sides, no subtlety,
    no room for complexity. Not three political sides, or four. Just a straight line
    with two choices. Pick a side.

- en: This is what my acquaintance wanted me to do. To reduce myself to a simple point
    on a line. To relax my uncertainty and join a side. Pick one, and adopt the ideas
    of those on that side. Learn one way of thinking, or, in fact, learn not to think,
    but to accept the group. Over time, slide further along the line so that I end
    up arguing for positions I don’t believe in, or even understand.

    idea. A supporter, like a sports fan, drunkenly shouting my team’s slogans. Screaming
    about simple solutions to complex problems. Picking an enemy to hate.
