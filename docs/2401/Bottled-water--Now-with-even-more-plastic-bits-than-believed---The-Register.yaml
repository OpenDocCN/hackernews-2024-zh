    of 10 to 100 times more minute plastic particles than previously believed, judging
    from a study published this week.

- en: We've long known about the presence of microplastic particles in bottled water
    and proliferating through nature, while nanoplastics (pieces less than a micron,
    or 0.001 mm) have been difficult to accurately measure. This is where boffins
    at the Columbia and Rutgers universities in the US come in with a newly developed
    microscopy technique to image some of the smallest plastic particles yet spotted
    in our water.

- en: Using a technique dubbed stimulated Raman scattering (SRS), the academics discovered
    an average of 240,000 plastic particles per litre of bottled water across three
    of the brands tested, with measurements ranging from 110,000 to 370,000 fragments
    per litre. This is, we're told, 10 to 100 times greater than earlier estimates.
    Around 90 percent of the particles detected using SRS qualified as nanoplastics,
    the rest being microplastics.

    student Naixin Qian, lead author of a [PNAS-published paper](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2300582121)
    describing this study, [explained](https://news.climate.columbia.edu/2024/01/08/bottled-water-can-contain-hundreds-of-thousands-of-previously-uncounted-tiny-plastic-bits-study-finds/).

- en: 'The team developed SRS to overcome three hurdles found with other techniques
    used to measure plastic particles in water: Poor instrument resolution, poor detection
    sensitivity, and an inability to distinguish different types of plastic. According
    to the team, they''ve cleared all three hurdles.'

- en: SRS works by shooting lasers at water samples to make specific molecules resonate
    and using software to identify plastic particles from those results. The team
    said they were able to train their SRS system to detect seven types of plastics
    with an identification rate of more than 96 percent and a false positive rate
    of just one percent, the team said. Speed of recognition was also not a problem.

    surface, SRS only needs several hours for a sample," Beizhan Yan, associate research

    there are orders of magnitude more plastic in bottled water than previously believed,
    there's still a lot the study's method isn't able to detect.

- en: According to the paper, the software was only able to account for about 10 percent
    of the total particles imaged using SRS. The rest, said Yan, could be organic,
    or inorganic particles including plastics that weren't among the seven types the
    algorithm was trained to identify.

    and different size distributions" found in water samples.

    expected since the bottle is made of PET," Yan told us. "Therefore, for a long
    time, we had the impression that the majority of plastic particles inside bottled
    water would be Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) particles of a few hundred nanometers
    in size."'

    commonly used in water filtration systems and "the most popular membrane material
    used in reverse osmosis … a common water purification method shared by all three
    brands [of water tested]," the team wrote in the paper.

- en: The boffins hope that their ability to identify specific types of plastic particles
    present in water can help find sources of microplastic contamination. PET and
    PE, both commonly used in the plastic bottles used to hold water, were, as noted,
    found in the samples. Other polymers were also found in the bottles, but aren't
    part of the packaging process, hence a likely contamination source "before or
    during water production," the team said.

    Yan told us the team is working on. They also plan to use their SRS technique
    to analyze tap water for nanoplastic contamination, as well as air samples and
    biological tissues. ®
