- en: what3words does not aim to replace street addressing. Rather, it is a useful
    addition when street addresses are not accurate enough, and an instant, scalable
    solution where addresses do not exist.

- en: Compared to current street addressing systems, 3 word addresses are far more
    accurate, as they refer to a specific 3m x 3m area. As the entire what3words grid
    is fixed, the 3 word address for a particular location will never change even
    if buildings or streets are redeveloped.

- en: 3 word addresses are unique, unlike street names which are often duplicated,
    and they are easier to communicate and share with others.

- en: what3words is much faster to set up and more cost-efficient than any regular
    street addressing system, as every 3 word address has already been pre-assigned,
    providing an instant, scalable solution.
